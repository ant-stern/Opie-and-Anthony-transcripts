<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Larry King's humorous introduction, acknowledging the show's chaotic nature. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton immediately launched into a series of discussions. Anthony recounted a near-death experience during a hailstorm, jokingly envisioning the headlines: "Shock jock, shocked, after releasing shocking cock shot."  This segued into a story about a friend who survived a lightning strike that split a tree he was standing under, prompting a discussion of lightning strike statistics. Anthony then described his extreme exhaustion and a near-sleep driving incident where he hallucinated chrome elephants, followed by a viewing of a video depicting someone falling asleep at the wheel. The conversation shifted to the NBA playoffs, focusing on the Mavericks' win over the Heat and criticisms of LeBron James's performance, fueled by rumors about Rashard Lewis and LeBron's girlfriend.

The main focus then turned to the hosts' frustrations with SiriusXM management. They vehemently expressed anger at the lack of recognition for their successful coverage of the Anthony Weiner scandal, which had generated significant publicity for the station but resulted in no commensurate appreciation from management. They created a satirical "Sirius XM Flow Chart" depicting how any positive event inevitably led to an internal "problem."  The hosts detailed their belief that SiriusXM didn't understand how to promote their show, comparing their current situation to "rotting" and contrasting it with their previous success at XM.  They discussed the media coverage of the Weiner photo leak and the perceived hypocrisy of other media outlets criticizing their actions, further criticizing the lack of support from SiriusXM PR.  The hosts stressed their feeling of being undervalued and the lack of proactive promotional efforts.

The discussion continued with stories of past successful events and stunts (live shows, an animation festival, street stunts) that were now deemed impossible due to company regulations and liability concerns. They described negative calls from management and their cynical view of the company's approach, comparing management's communication style to a corporate handbook on delivering bad news. The conversation circled back to LeBron James's poor playoff performance and the Rashard Lewis rumor, adding the rumor that Delonte West had slept with LeBronâ€™s mother the previous year. The hosts reiterated their frustration with management's perceived inaction and lack of understanding of their show's dynamic, expressing a desire for simple acknowledgment of their hard work and contrasting their current situation with the support they previously received.  The broadcast ended with further commentary on management's perceived incompetence and their intention to leave SiriusXM at the end of their contract.  Throughout, humorous anecdotes, jests, and several references to baby pictures peppered the conversation.

The show then addressed a critical article by Mary Elizabeth Williams titled "It's Time for Shock Jocks to Disappear," which prompted vehement disagreement and sarcastic, derisive commentary from the hosts, utilizing vulgar and offensive language, including misogynistic remarks about Williams' appearance and intelligence.  A significant portion focused on the photo of Anthony Weiner's genitals, shared on their show by Andrew Breitbart, and the debate surrounding its newsworthiness, contrasting their actions with other media outlets. They discussed past "outrageous stunts," including an eggnog drinking contest resulting in vomiting, and interactions with various guests.  The hosts challenged Williams' claims about their show's relevance and the nature of their humor, arguing it involved more than just "shocking things," referencing past incidents and controversies involving themselves, Howard Stern, and Don Imus.  The discussion returned to SiriusXM's perceived over-cautiousness regarding content, specifically regarding replaying audio involving bodily fluids, further fueling their frustration with company policies and perceived lack of support.  They also mentioned Stephen Colbert's mentions of their show and the mishandling of a Paris Hilton video by company PR.  Finally, they briefly mentioned a "This Day in ONA History" segment and a YouTube video by "The Warrior" exposing Hulk Hogan.

The next segment focused on the fallout from the release of the Anthony Weiner photo, discussing its dissemination across various media outlets and the reactions of other personalities, notably Barbara Walters' perceived jealousy and the perceived targeting of Andrew Breitbart. The conversation touched upon infidelity, the ethics of exposing politicians' personal failings, and comparisons to past scandals involving Bill Clinton and Ted Haggarty.  Stephen Colbert's comedic treatment of the situation was praised. A significant portion featured audio clips from and discussion about the Ron & Fez show, focusing on a breakdown experienced by Roland, Fez's teasing of Roland's emotional moment, and listener calls.  They played a "clean" version of an earlier segment and compared it to the uncensored version. Jim Norton proposed a charity fundraising idea involving a photograph with all five living US presidents.  A "This Day in ONA" segment highlighted the Iron Sheik's expletive-laden tirade from a past appearance.

A segment extensively covered the fallout from a publicized story about Fez Whatley and his management, detailing multiple meetings the hosts had and expressing fatigue with the ongoing drama. They jokingly suggested a "Jim Henson and Fez Show," followed by impressions of Fez and Roland from the Ron and Fez show, including a portrayal of Roland crying. This transitioned into a humorous skit involving Batman characters and sarcastic commentary on Fez's situation.

The broadcast concluded with an in-studio interview with Ice-T and Coco. They discussed their new reality show, "Ice Loves Coco," its comedic aspects, Ice-T's career trajectory, managing finances in the entertainment industry, and the challenges of maintaining relationships amidst fame. Coco discussed her reality show experience and Twitter use, including the removal of a picture.  They discussed their relationship dynamic, with Ice-T sharing his "sexual code" and Coco revealing some of her own. The interview ended with promotion of their reality show, Ice-T's new book and movie, and the playing and discussion of a blueberry song parody created by an unnamed intern from the Ron & Fez show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  I should get it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Yes, it's Friday. Holy shit, we made it to Friday, thank God.  Thank Jesus Christ on the cross.  You got to say that every time you say Jesus.  Jesus.  Thank you, Jesus.  I thought Jesus was coming back yesterday, last night.  Holy mother of God. 
[00:01:00]  Was it bad?  Yeah.  A lot of lightning in the sky.  Actually, one of the boys there, one of the brothers there from Letterman.  The Stengles?  Yeah, the Stengles.  Who I'm in cahoots with to make Fez cry?  Oh, yeah, of course.  I haven't forgotten.  They're actually not brothers, they're a married couple.  Oh, they're married couples.  Oh, I thought they were brothers.  Oh, Justin and Eric Stengel are a married couple.  That's cute.  It is cute.  I saw a tweet about the weather, and he said it looked like end of days. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, wow.  Where it was just Armageddon happening.  And then it rolled into my neck of the woods, neck of the nape, nape of the wape.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it was very Armageddon-ish.  Hail, huge hail was coming down.  How big was the hail?  Uh, it was, uh, I like saying the size of golf ball, because that's usually the rule  of thumb.  The standard with hail is the size of golf balls.  Well, let's be honest, it was like raisins. 
[00:02:00]  It was raisin-ish.  Because people get real hail storms where it is golf balls and bigger.  It screws your car up.  Around here, I think we get maybe raisins falling from the sky every once in a while.  I did see some that were probably the size of grapes.  Really?  You know, pre-dried raisins are grapes.  Really?  And, uh, yeah, there was some grape size coming down.  Um, and, uh, I jumped in the pool.  Mm-hmm.  I jumped in my pool in this hailstorm, and, uh, and there was lightning and thunder, and 
[00:02:30]  all I was thinking is what the headline would be if I had been struck by lightning.  And, uh, I, I think it was shock jock, shocked, after shocking cock shot, after release of  shocking cock shot.  You have too much time on your hands.  No, no.  You gotta get a hobby, man.  You gotta get some kind of hobby or have a kid.  No, I was just thinking of how the news would portray it if I had been struck by lightning 
[00:03:00]  after everything that has transpired over the week.  Shock jock, shocked, after releasing shocking cock shot.  What a shock.  Shock.  What a shock, shock jock.  Yes.  Shock to death after a week of showing cock.  Shock, cock, shot.  Shock.  Cock.  It was cool, though, um, when you're in, in a pool, when, like, hail is falling.  And hitting it all around you?  It's just such a weird thing, yeah.  It's such a weird, like, uh, contrast. 
[00:03:30]  Do you have a death wish?  No, I knew everything would be okie-dokie.  You do a lot of...  I was in the low, I was in the low, uh, area of, uh, of the neighborhood.  Oh, that's good, because lightning understands that if it hits the water.  Yeah.  Let's just hit the deep end and make sure it just stays around there.  Does that happen, though?  I'm wondering, do you do?  Does lightning strike, uh, the water in a pool, or, or would it strike the trees around  me, or...  It would be pretty tough to hit the pool.  I think so.  I think it's possible, though.  There's so many high points, like, and my house has those peaks on it, so it's got the 
[00:04:00]  lightning rods on top, and I think that would attract the lightning.  You know, every day, we come in here, and you never know, this is the beauty of our show,  we just are babbling, and then it leads to stuff.  Yeah.  I'm laughing inside, because now I get to tell the story of good old, uh, I don't,  I can't say his name, fuck.  He's, uh, an Asian friend of mine.  Ah.  Who I used to caddy with.  Caddy.  I've told this story many times. 
[00:04:30]  Uh, Huntington Crescent Club.  He's under a tree, four, uh, it's called four caddying, where you go ahead, so you can  see the guys hit their golf ball.  He's under a tree.  I believe it was, let me say, seventh hole.  He's on the left side, uh, uh, about 180 yards out, right?  And there's sort of a lightning thing happening, but it's not really raining.  And the lightning hits the tree that he's under, splits it in half.  Oh, wow.  Like a movie.  No damage to him, really. 
[00:05:00]  And this, this Asian friend of mine, not an expression on his damn face.  Really?  Yes.  Just so they're like, bah, right.  Just gotta watch the ball.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Like a thing, like a movie, hits the tree, and yes, it pretty much splits in half around  him.  Wow.  And not even a reaction by the guy.  I would drop my clubs and say, fuck this, I'm going home.  They are resilient.  But.  Uh, let's see.  Nearly 100 people die from lightning strikes each year, and hundreds are injured.  That's it? 
[00:05:30]  If you see lightning or hear thunder, you are a potential target for lightning strike.  Uh, lightning fatalities or injuries occur most often when you are in a pool, near or  in water, indoor or outdoor pools, including showers or plumbing, near or under trees and  tall objects, diving boards, towers, lifeguard stands, poles, et cetera.  So I guess I was putting myself in some form of danger. 
[00:06:00]  Boy.  As I jumped in the, uh, the pool during the lightning storm.  I thought that.  I thought you were safe.  I thought the, uh, deaths were a lot higher than that.  Only 100 a year?  Yeah, that ain't nothing.  That's for America, right?  America.  America.  Oh.  I did not know.  I thought in a pool with other higher things around you, uh, and my pool is grounded.  Like, when it was made, they took all that rebar that they, uh, put the, um, the, uh, gunite 
[00:06:30]  on.  Right.  And they actually stick a shitload of grounding poles in and attach them to that.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  I, um, I saw the storm rolling in.  I was, I was tired, man.  I finally slept for the first time in a couple of days.  Oh God.  There was a lot of excitement around this show the last few days.  Now everyone goes away and now it's just us doing our, our, our show.  You are absolutely right.  Cause I almost died three times driving home yesterday.  I had to punch myself in the face cause you were so tired and roll my windows down and 
[00:07:00]  say, and I was yelling, stay awake, Anthony, stay awake.  And then I almost hit, I almost hit the, uh, divider three times driving home.  And then I literally saw chromium elephants crossing the expressway and I had to like shake my  head and look and then they were gone, but they looked like giant chrome elephants, like  slowly walking into the road.  I was hallucinating.  Get the fuck out of here.  I swear to you.  I thought the circus was in town. 
[00:07:30]  And then I had to shake my head like, like fuck, wake up.  Yeah.  I was that tired.  When I finally got home, I went into, uh, my room and within, it had to be 10 seconds.  I was asleep.  Not cold.  Uh, totally asleep.  I was amazed.  I went to bed last night.  I love that guy.  Yeah.  I went to bed last night and, uh, and slept till, is that a real video?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen it a million times.  It's an inside camera of some guy falling asleep at the wheel and he has an accident. 
[00:08:00]  He ends up in the back seat.  That's what happens to you.  He just crashes and he rolls his vehicle, I guess.  He's totally asleep.  Wow.  Look at his face.  He's all fucking, he's all fucked up.  Oh my God.  And then he just ends up in the back.  That's fucked up.  Oh God.  You can't do that.  It's so scary because you have no power over it.  I said, I tired driving 10 times worse than drunk driving.  At least you kind of, at least when you're trying.  Yeah.  At least you're trying. 
[00:08:30]  At least you're giving it your all.  I, I'm a horrible sleeper.  I went to, I wanted to watch that heat Mavs game.  I know you guys aren't really NBA guys, but I was watching.  Mavs win?  Yeah.  The fucking Mavs won, Anthony.  That's what I heard.  And, uh, that's why I'm, I'm, I'm so pissed off at Scottie Pippen and he'll never care,  obviously.  But he came out recently and said that LeBron James is better than Michael Jordan.  Right.  Michael Jordan came to play in the playoffs.  This fucking LeBron James is a bust in the playoffs. 
[00:09:00]  And this isn't the first year he's a bust in the playoffs.  Really?  He fucking sucks.  Yeah.  The team needed him.  How many perints?  He had 17 last night and he had a triple double because people are going to fucking yell at  me about that.  That's a big deal in basketball.  Yes.  A triple double?  So I'll acknowledge he had a triple double, but when it mattered most, he had two points  in the fourth quarter.  Only two in the fourth.  When, when his team needed him.  Michael Jordan doesn't score two points in the, in the, in the fourth quarter in a playoff  game ever.  Michael Jordan scored two points on the bench. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Hey, on the bench.  And, uh, the Mavs, um, fucking got my fingers crossed one game from winning this thing.  Oh, they're up three to two?  They're up three to two, but now they go back to Miami for the final two.  So now it gets tough.  This is not a guarantee whatsoever.  This could get exciting.  Yeah.  I might watch.  Really?  Final score.  If it, if it gets down to it where, where it's one game and, uh, and, uh, it's the last  five minutes, I could tune in.  Oh, good.  But, uh, how much did they win by? 
[00:10:00]  It was close.  It was, uh, what was the final?  Like I said, I had it.  I crashed.  Uh, 112 to 103.  Um, and I need someone that really knows their sports.  Cause there's a story that they're not talking about on ABC, but man, Twitter's talking about  it.  And a lot of the sports guys that somebody may have slept with LeBron James's girlfriend.  And that's why he was a bust in the game before this one.  Remember when I was talking about how he only scored eight points?  Yeah.  LeBron, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Jordan doesn't score just eight points in a playoff 
[00:10:30]  game ever, by the way.  And now he's, he only had two points when the team needed him, uh, most last night.  And there's this big rumor, there it is, uh, Rashard Lewis definitely had sex with LeBron  James's girlfriend.  That's, that is a headline I just read.  Who's Rashard Lewis?  He plays for, help me out, boys and girls, Lakers?  Is he a Laker?  I don't know.  What is with the women in LeBron's life banging other players?  112 to 103.  I said that.  He said that.  Oh no, I just, I just got it here. 
[00:11:00]  I see what you're doing.  I just got it here.  There's a little delay.  I see what you're doing.  Without getting into it, uh.  Yeah, yeah.  This play's proven.  Once again, they have no fucking idea what our show's about.  Not a fucking clue.  They don't have a clue.  They don't understand how to fucking, uh, work this show to make it the best it could  possibly be.  Do you think the flow chart all leads to one area?  The flow chart.  Flow chart.  Flow chart for Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Uh, make a box up top of your page right now and put something good happens, okay? 
[00:11:30]  Now an arrow that goes right down to another box and just put problem.  Oh, you made the flow chart?  Oh, here's a serious flow chart.  I'm not going to say who made the flow chart, but I applaud this person.  That's perfect.  Here's the serious flow chart.  We should tweet this.  Yes.  Because let me, let me tell you something.  Uh, this Anthony Weiner thing, which we'll get into again.  This is perfect.  The last two days, this show got massive publicity.  As did the platform itself.  Well, I was going to say for Sirius XM and of course, massive, uh, publicity for ourselves, 
[00:12:00]  which we absolutely love.  We're not even going to front about.  I'll tell you that right now, not that we need it, not one fucking guy of importance  that works for Sirius XM even walked by our studio, popped their head in and said, good  job.  No.  And some people around here would say, well, that's your job.  No, it's not.  Not one fucking person walked through, popped their head in of importance, by the way,  because a few of the lower level guys did.  Yeah.  And go, wow, great job. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  You know how many times CNN and the rest of them said Sirius XM?  Sirius XM, satellite radio.  Way more publicity than their dumb lady Gaga interview they did with Gayle King, where  Jimmy wasn't allowed to get his picture taken.  I didn't hear shite about that.  Not shite.  Not only did no one pop their head in just to say, great job.  Yeah.  It turns out that it led to, we have a problem.  We have a problem.  We're not getting fired or suspended. 
[00:13:00]  None of that shit.  Don't worry about that.  But it's one of those, we have a problem that just fucking, fucking infuriates us.  They had to find something.  And that's why the flow chart, the Sirius flow chart.  I love this flow chart.  It starts out at the top.  You guys all understand flow charts.  A big box that says, did you do good?  Did you do good?  And then it leads to, you know, a flow chart now leads to other things, right?  Yeah.  Two arrows pointing down to either yes.  Yes.  Or no.  No.  So this Sirius flow chart, did you do good? 
[00:13:30]  I would say yes.  Yes.  So now we're to this point.  Yes.  We followed the arrow from yes and see what option we have after that.  And then the next option and the only option after, did you do good, we say yes, is we have a problem.  We have a problem.  That explains Sirius XM right there in our show.  And that stops the flow chart.  And by the way, to the right is another arrow that goes, did you do good?  Yeah.  And then the box is no.  Right.  And that has an arrow that goes to, we have a problem. 
[00:14:00]  So basically what we're trying to tell everyone today is no matter what you do around here,  it always leads to a problem.  Do we have a problem?  I am.  It can't just be like, let's all relax, have a pizza party, have a couple of the big wigs  come walking through and just poke their head and go, hey, guys, just want to say great  job the last few days.  Just enjoy nothing.  The moment.  Nothing.  For a second.  Nothing.  Could we enjoy the moment for a second?  I, we have to hang this up.  So it's probably the most accurate thing I've ever, ever seen. 
[00:14:30]  Put it right next to don't go home.  Don't go home with hope.  Don't go.  This has to go next to don't go home with hope.  It's the serious flow chart.  Right.  I think it's brilliant.  I think the guys that, that probably should have popped their head in and just gave us  a quick, good job guys.  Yeah.  Are too busy taking wheelbarrows of money and dumping it over to the other side of the  floor.  Dumping it into legal fees for a giant lawsuit.  I think they're just dumping wheelbarrows of cash into Howard's area. 
[00:15:00]  And the next time he works, whenever that is, he'll pick it up and put it in a bank.  I picture a room.  I picture a room that looks like the counting room in Scarface.  Right.  Where it's just frrrr in 80s montage music playing.  And they're just frrrr counting the money that goes over to the other side of the building.  Yeah.  And making sure Howard gets it when he works, by the way.  Which, by the way, God bless Howard Stern. 
[00:15:30]  I'm not.  It is just amazing.  People get confused by that.  No.  If you could get that deal, I would sign tomorrow.  Take it.  Take it.  Just shows that some people aren't that smart around here, though.  I'll tell you that.  It's amazing.  Oh, of course.  Believe me.  It's based on utter stupidity on the part of certain people.  We're busting our asses day in and day out.  I know it's radio.  But in the radio world, trust me, we're busting our asses.  I know there's tougher jobs out there.  It's all relative.  It's all relative.  But you're listening to two guys, three guys, excuse me, that are busting their asses every 
[00:16:00]  fucking day.  And we can't even get a good job, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not that I need that to go home with, but it just plays into this whole place, and that's  why it bothers me.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I'd actually rather not have a good job, guys, from them.  Honestly, they really, because them saying good job obviously means bad job.  Bad, yes, yes.  Because whenever something's good, they say it's bad.  So when they don't say anything, it must mean it's good.  Because they get everything wrong.  They get everything wrong. 
[00:16:30]  You're right.  Wrong.  We're sitting here on a Friday morning after two amazing days of press for us and  the show.  And the company.  And it led to a problem.  And that's all we can say right now.  A problem.  A problem that's not going to get us fired or suspended, but it's just going to make us  not want to be here even more.  It's just another thing.  It's not something major.  It's not a firing, a suspension, or anything to do with any of the staff.  It's just another little thing, another little support piece, another piece of the foundation 
[00:17:00]  that they chisel away at.  And then just go, all right, now continue doing the great job you do that we don't recognize.  I'll tell you, it came out with all the press we've got in the last couple of days that we've  kind of like, wow, oh yeah, those guys.  Right, right.  And you know what?  I can't even be mad.  They're right.  They're absolutely right.  We had a lot of momentum going into coming over to this building. 
[00:17:30]  We had our own studio and all that.  We had an incredible amount of momentum.  And I told Anthony last night, I'm like, I just feel like we've been just kind of rotting  over here.  I know we're doing good radio.  I really do know we're doing good radio.  Some of the best of our careers, I would say.  I believe we're doing our jobs.  Yeah.  But as far as a company trying to push you forward and getting the momentum going and  what does that mean and making the show bigger, these guys don't understand or know how to 
[00:18:00]  do that.  No.  And that's why it's going to make it so easy just to walk away after this contract.  Because why would we stay here and just continue rotting?  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show is a stagnant puddle with mosquito larvae in it.  Right.  It's just sitting here.  So some of these writers were absolutely right.  But I have to tell you, it's no fault of ours.  No.  Because I really do believe what Ant just said is the truth, that we've been doing some  of the best radio of our careers.  The fans are loving the shit out of the show. 
[00:18:30]  Believe me.  I know that.  But as far as being out there and having new people that have never heard of us before  find us, get on board, enjoy the show, that shit doesn't happen because we don't go out.  We're not allowed to do half of the shocking stuff.  When they said shock jock, I'm laughing.  Because I'm like, especially, we got an article, we're going to go through it, that Salon.com  woman that wrote how the shock jock is dead and how they should just not exist anymore. 
[00:19:00]  And it's like, but it's true because we're not shock jocks and maybe not by choice.  I mean, obviously, as we get older and mature, we move the show in a different direction.  Right.  But we are incapable of being shock jocks anymore.  We have that card in our pocket.  Yeah.  In our playing deck.  Like, certainly, we could be shock jocks at any moment.  But this show has moved on from that bullshit a long time ago.  I haven't been there.  And the Anthony Wiener photo, we just did what every news outlet in the world wanted to do, 
[00:19:30]  but they couldn't figure out how to do it.  Right.  Every radio guy, including Rush Limbaugh and that stupid Ed Schultz and the rest of them,  all wanted to be the ones.  Exactly.  That fucking phone went around this room and we took our shot.  We said, what the fuck?  Simple as that.  Yep.  I got a clip of Barbara Walters.  You can hear how jealous she is.  Yeah.  You can hear it.  So a few people tried to spun it that shock jocks, Opie and Anthony, how dare they, blah, 
[00:20:00]  blah, blah.  Everybody wanted to do it.  They just couldn't figure out how to do it yet.  Oh, those shock jocks.  The picture was going to be out there.  But how come when other people do it, it's considered leaking it?  Right.  But when radio guys do it, it's a problem.  It's shock jocks.  It's amazing.  Because it's the easiest thing to say.  I understand why Breitbart's not happy, but why does the rest of the media, why do they  have any opinion about it?  The nerve of the other people in the media to have any fucking judgment about how anybody  gets information out there.  I wouldn't be surprised if there were a lot of negotiations going on. 
[00:20:30]  I don't even know with Breitbart.  I don't know that guy, by the way, just so people know.  Anthony knew him a little bit, and Jimmy knows him a little bit.  I met him for the first time the other day.  So I don't know what he was thinking whatsoever.  But I would bet money, like we've talked about the last couple days on the show, that there's  more than one copy of that photo.  And I bet you there were some negotiations going on out there.  And it was just a matter of time.  That picture was going to see the light of day.  And I'm not justifying what we did.  We know what we did, and I would do it again tomorrow.  Yeah.  But all these other news outlets and radio guys, they were all clamoring and hoping they 
[00:21:00]  had a shot at maybe leaking that photo.  Of course.  Including Barbara Walters, who shows her jealousy on The View.  She goes, I saw that picture two days ago.  So what does that mean?  Did you?  You didn't have the balls to try to figure it out, Bawa.  Did you sit on it?  Yeah, exactly.  What's the matter?  Because he wasn't a married senator?  He didn't want to sit on it?  Babs?  Shut the fuck up.  Babs.  She really bugs me.  So, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  We just started three or four things.  I'm trying to wrap it up.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I mean, so I try not to be bitter here, to be honest with you.  But it's really, it's tough.  It's tough.  It really is.  It's just tough.  And I do want one of these big guys to maybe just poke their head in just to show, oh,  I get it.  You know?  Yeah.  And I understand it's never going to happen.  You know, they don't give a fuck about it.  It's as simple as that.  And believe me, I...  We just stood on our heads for two days. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  And then no one noticed around here.  Yeah.  No one noticed.  Well, the publicity department here must have done something to help.  Oh, really?  They didn't even push it forward.  No.  They didn't even...  I guess...  Do we have a PR department?  Oh, yes.  I was getting interviewed...  Mars?  Oh, oh, I'm sorry.  I got the initials.  I was getting interview requests from my R agent from L.A.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You would think the PR department, if we were a big piece of this company or someone  they cared about, they actually would have sat us down for two minutes and go, okay, wow, 
[00:22:30]  how do we capitalize on this?  Because that's what we used to do at XM, by the way.  Holy shit, how do we capitalize on this?  Yeah.  I'm going to put...  You know, they should have put out interview requests for real places.  Like yesterday, Bob's all excited calls me.  Inside Edition wants to interview you guys.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  I was asleep through the...  The Inside Edition phone calls?  Yeah, so I woke up.  I read like a...  Is that show even on TV anymore?  I read a text and it's like, Bob, hey, you got to get in touch with Inside Edition within  the next couple of hours.  They want to talk to you.  And it was like four hours after I got it. 
[00:23:00]  I'm like, ah, well, I guess that's...  Trust me.  Ah, well.  Yeah, but there is a PR department around here.  Why didn't they ever...  Why didn't they just sit down with us and go, wow, how do we capitalize on this?  What do we do?  Do we do anything?  Yeah, yeah.  Do we just sit back?  Do you guys want to do anything?  These are the questions they should have asked us.  Yeah.  Oh, Inside Edition.  Yes, thank you, young Sam.  Inside Edition speaks with such stars as Ian Halperin.  Ian Halperin.  Ian Halperin is now dead to this radio show. 
[00:23:30]  He's dead to us.  What did he do?  Nothing.  That's why he's dead to us.  Ah, turd.  He's never given us a scoop in his life.  Turd.  He's dead to us.  Ah, screw him.  So, that's what's disappointing about the whole thing.  Yeah.  Knowing that you don't have anyone of importance that even just pokes in to say, hey, wow,  nice job.  I don't even know if they even realize we're doing a show day in and day out.  And then you got a PR department that doesn't even have the smarts or maybe they just don't  care enough to sit us down and go, how do we capitalize on this? 
[00:24:00]  What should we do here?  How do we push this forward?  How do we make you guys look a little better?  You know why?  Because management wasn't able to take a picture with what happened.  See, if they can take a picture with like a star in the fishbowl, then it's huge.  They think, wow, this is a huge event.  And they're all patting each other on the back and everything.  But when something real happens and it's all over every fucking TV screen on the news 
[00:24:30]  and it involves a show on this platform, the company, something like that, they're just  like, ah, I can't take a picture with that.  So that's how they gauge it.  They make sure that we don't take a picture with it either.  Exactly.  Hey, could you, not here, could you just kind of, basically being shooed out of the area.  Hey, Riff Raff, could you just not be around when the big celebrities come in because you  embarrass us.  Yeah, we were shooed away from, ah, whatever.  It's sick to my stomach. 
[00:25:00]  We're an embarrassment.  And, and, and then.  I should put it in the intro when I go.  We're an embarrassment.  Did we air Stephen Colbert to the intro yet?  Oh, I haven't seen the second one because I guess last night he goofed on us again.  Yeah, we got, we got so much to get to, but.  Yeah.  I don't think we added Stephen Colbert to the intro yet, but we do have production.  All right, good.  Uh, I want to keep talking about this momentum thing, which we, which we had.  And I was reminded of when we finally got this big hit in the media.  Yeah, we kind of got, we're lulled into this. 
[00:25:30]  And I got this dope way down the hall.  His name's Scott.  I'm still infuriated to this point that he grabs me and goes, Hey, you guys need to get  out there.  Yeah, we know.  I don't know.  I'm thinking a couple of wireless mics in Times Square.  That's what he thinks of us in the show.  I think, I don't know.  You guys, uh, wireless mics in Times Square.  That's his big idea for one of his big shows.  We had, he gets paid a shitload to come up with shit like that.  We used to do so many things when we were like left alone to our own devices over there at 
[00:26:00]  the XM studio.  Um, we were able to put things together and just like, yeah, the comedy tours, like all  that shit that got us out there in front of thousands of fans with a long table where  we would sit after the show with, uh, the likes of, uh, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, and we  would all sign things and talk to the fans.  It got us out there. 
[00:26:30]  But we, the animation festival, all this stuff that we just don't do anymore.  The, the, the, the bits on the street, the box of cocks.  No, why?  Just everything.  No, why here?  Flow chart.  Animation festival.  Uh, did you do good?  Yes.  It was good?  Okay.  Animation festival.  Did you do good?  I'm going back to the flow chart.  Go to yes on that one.  Don't go to no.  But I want to explain why we did good.  Yeah.  First of all, that was an event where we actually sold tickets to.  The damn thing sold out.  Sponsors were extremely happy and it showed us in a really good light. 
[00:27:00]  It was a, it was a classy, classy ONA event.  Very nice.  No tits were shown.  It was just like, wow, this is really nice and entertaining.  So yes, I go to yes.  Okay.  And then the flow chart, the serious flow chart goes down from yes to we have a problem.  Oh, we have a problem.  We can't, we can't do it anymore.  Oh, we can't, we couldn't sell it.  Uh, we need this.  We need that legal.  We need, uh, somebody to sign a waiver that, uh, absolves us from any responsibility of 
[00:27:30]  even existing.  Could we, uh, if anything happens, uh, uh, uh, we, we're, we're not supposed to, uh, can  we?  Oh my God.  If something happens at an event, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.  This table self-destruct in 10 seconds.  Good luck, Jim.  Do you, do you have a, fuck, do you have a sound effect of a truck backing up with the  beeps?  I used to.  Damn it.  We used to use that when, uh, Mindy would come in.  That's right.  Yes. 
[00:28:00]  Oh yes.  Eggnog challenge.  Gave us baby bird.  Can't do that anymore.  The, uh, live shows we used to just do at the drop of a hat, so to say at local bars,  we would just be like, hey, you know what?  Why don't we all meet at, uh, and then we do, we just pick a bar and have a few beers  with the listeners.  Can't do that.  Because God forbid somebody drinks and then maybe drives home and gets into an accident.  Somebody's responsible. 
[00:28:30]  Bits on the street?  Oh, well, we need a waiver, a sign from anybody that was involved.  Well, that takes away from the element to surprise, doesn't it?  And that's what the whole thing is about, almost like a camera thing.  How about the virus tour?  Well, oh boy, those venues and that.  How about someone works to figure out how the fuck we could do it?  Let me go to the flowchart.  Or, uh, yes.  Oh, we have a problem.  It went to we have a problem.  Immediately.  Immediately.  I just, I just.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. 
[00:29:00]  See, we should be happy today is what I'm saying.  But there were phone calls yesterday that just had to be picky and just fucking annoying as all hell.  And, of course, that's how it always is.  And I get, when I'm on the phone with anyone from management, anyone,  please don't insult me by thinking I'm not completely aware of everything that's going on in every word.  I am the consummate diplomat, by the way.  The consummate diplomat. 
[00:29:30]  I could sit and talk and I'm not being phony.  I'm being real and I'm actually talking.  And but but when I hear certain catchphrases and keywords and and questions, I know what you're getting at.  So don't insult me by trying to hedge around it.  Just fucking tell me.  All right.  Well, they read those corporate books and and they had to use some of that knowledge.  How to handle the staff. 
[00:30:00]  How to pass along bad news to a staff member.  What chapter was that?  Shut up.  And I see it as a chapter in a fucking handbook that is passed around the cubicle.  Start with a compliment.  Start with a compliment.  Start with a compliment.  Get them off balance.  You don't think we know all that shit?  Give some small talk about the weather.  Know what the book is called?  How to blue sky anything.  Oh, blue sky.  How to green light.  How to green light and blue sky and tee up and raise up the flagpole and all that shit. 
[00:30:30]  How to properly bake anything.  Bake.  Remember all that shit.  You bake your head.  All right.  What do you want to do?  We got Barbara Walters, Anthony Weiner.  We got shock jocks must disappear.  And we got the Lashard Lewis rumor.  Lashard Lewis rumor.  That's the LeBron James story.  Oh, right.  Right.  Let me go to JJ.  He's pretty good, man.  I like JJ in New Hampshire.  Dynamite.  Oh, by the way, I know I'm not going to change a lot of people's opinion on stuff. 
[00:31:00]  But when we say that we're doing some of the best radio of our careers, I really do believe that.  And Anthony believes that.  Yeah.  Anthony, do you believe that?  I do.  Just listen to some of the old jokes.  There's a lot of frustration, though.  Yes.  The things that are beyond our control.  Because we're.  Yes.  It's very, very irritating.  And it's because we are working to do some of the best shows we do.  And it's.  Well, this used to be a partnership.  Translate over there.  It used to be a partnership where we all do our jobs, which I think we're doing.  I think we're hitting it out of the park every day. 
[00:31:30]  And then you have the company and management people doing their jobs, which means, you know,  taking this amazing radio show.  And I really do believe it's still amazing and pushing it forward and how to make it bigger  and better.  You know what I mean?  Right.  And they just don't do that whatsoever.  No.  With that said, I know, you know, a lot of guys out there think the NEW days were the best.  No.  That's fine, too.  I personally don't think that.  But.  You want to hear the same Ronald Reagan imitation replay three times during the show? 
[00:32:00]  We did some great.  Remember that?  Oh, we did.  We did some great stuff.  Remember how we used to replay a lot of stuff and people get angry with us?  I heard that, dude.  Which is fine.  But it's just an example that like now we carry a show for at least four hours of new stuff.  That's I would put it as fun.  And I haven't.  Entertaining.  I remember the NAW days and maybe even the early XM days going home going, wow, we sucked 
[00:32:30]  today.  Sucked ass today.  And I was very hit or miss.  I can't remember the last time I actually walked home thinking we sucked today.  There might have been a segment or a guest or something.  Sure.  But I'm talking about the overall show day in and day out.  I haven't gone.  I can't remember.  It's been it's been at least two plus years where I walked home and go, wow, we really  just sucked today.  So you would put so you would say we did good.  We did good.  All right.  Quick, quick.  Go to the flow chart.  We did good.  Yes.  Where do we go to there?  Oh, wait, wait. 
[00:33:00]  We have a problem.  I guess we have a problem.  But with NAW, I remember walking home a lot or driving home or taking the train home going,  wow, we sucked today.  But we'll do better tomorrow.  But what makes that hard as far as remembering is we only played the best of the best from  that year.  We're not going to play one of those suck ass shows.  That would be a great best of one of the suck ass shows in its entirety.  Like with no edits or anything, people might be like, wow, might have a better picture  of everything. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, God.  Why are they playing music?  Yeah.  Like, yeah.  So whatever.  SiriusXM, I'm waiting for my thank you.  We gave you guys massive fucking press the last two days.  Great publicity.  And guess what?  In a positive way for once.  I mean, yeah, yeah.  It was a positive for what we do.  That was absolutely part of the news story that was ongoing.  Right.  And it's not like he was just some regular citizen.  He was a congressman.  And again, a lot of places would have put that out.  As soon as they got it, Preston would have put that up. 
[00:34:00]  Any other place that could have put it up would have put it up.  We attached ourselves to the biggest story, at least in the country, at least.  It's a worldwide story.  But as far as being the biggest story in the country, we were the fucking, the highlight,  the end, the crescendo of that was this fucking show.  Yeah.  But, you know, these guys.  I got a positive email.  I did get a positive email from Gary. 
[00:34:30]  From your doctor.  Say positive AIDS.  He sent a good email.  But those are the guys I'm talking about.  Those are the cute guys.  Rob said something very nice.  Those are the cute guys.  I don't even have a problem with them.  See, look, they're the smiley face guys.  I don't have a problem with them.  But I know in my soul they're not capable of moving this show forward.  They could do some day in and day out type stuff for us.  And I appreciate that.  Yes, if you need to know the truth.  But as far as moving the show forward and getting real momentum for the show, 
[00:35:00]  I don't see that ever happening with those guys.  No.  And I've told the proper people that.  So, you know, it's just what it is.  You know.  Maybe someday.  I don't know.  I can't wait around waiting for that day.  No.  The problem is it all comes down.  Everything rolls downhill.  And when the attitude of above is just the attitude that comes downhill.  That's all it is.  And it will never change from here up.  It has to change from up down.  It will never change from here up though.  Nothing will be done here that ever makes other people who can do things for the show 
[00:35:30]  do things for the show.  Because they're too worried about doing things for themselves.  It won't make them do anything for the show.  It's almost like, you know, the head has to be right before the body kind of is.  It's not like it's inspiration.  But there's no way this show will ever do anything that motivates people to promote the show  or to do things that they haven't been doing for all this time.  I understand all that.  But they don't even do the basics.  Like the PR department.  I don't even know who they are. 
[00:36:00]  I don't either.  We used to know those people.  Yeah.  They don't even contact us.  They don't email us.  They don't call us.  They don't stop by the studio to go, wow, you guys are pretty much on every news station.  You're in every paper.  How do we capitalize on this?  Here's an example.  How about you call, as a station, you call some of these entertainment shows, interview  shows, whatever, and sit us down and say, hey, guys, after the show, we're going to do  such and such show.  This one, we spoke with these people. 
[00:36:30]  We're setting up interviews for you guys.  We want you to talk about it.  Get the name of the company and the show out there.  And then we just, one after another, bang, bang, bang these things out.  Right.  If we felt like it.  I'm not even sure what we would have thought.  Whatever.  But at least say, hey, do you want us to take the fucking ball and go to some of these  shows and get your side of the story out or whatever?  Yeah.  It was just, hey, hey.  Know what they thought was great?  Putting us on the front page of Sirius, I don't even, what is the website? 
[00:37:00]  And I swear to God, I don't know.  SiriusXM.com.  Okay, that's what it is.  I really don't know.  I was about to say Sirius.com.  I would have been wrong.  That's what they did.  They feel like they did their job.  And we're already off.  I just see a steering wheel.  Oh, no.  They moved us down already.  Oh, we're after.  We were the first thing you saw when you went to SiriusXM.com yesterday.  And people were emailing me and tweeting me going, look, guys, the company does care.  That's what they thought was what they needed to do.  Yeah.  I work for this place.  I don't go to that website.  Why would I go to SiriusXM.com?  There's no reason to go there. 
[00:37:30]  There really isn't.  And most of the listeners, they're not going to SiriusXM.com.  Unless maybe you want to, like, subscribe, I guess.  And that's...  Can you do that online?  And that's preaching to the converted already.  Right, exactly.  So it doesn't even matter that you poke our heads on your fucking front page.  Who gives a fuck?  What else are you doing?  Well, you don't think that's good promotion for the show?  You don't think the website is seen by all these new people who don't know the show that  they're all looking at the website's front page?  Drop in.  That's the way to do it.  Yeah.  When it comes to websites, it's not even a blip. 
[00:38:00]  But I understand they actually hung a sign in the building as well.  Yes.  Which is very good.  So the employees know we work here.  Between the pretzels and the Diet Mountain Dew.  Which will probably be cut off.  In the food room.  You mentioned it.  Right.  They didn't know there was Diet Mountain Dew in there.  So what they're going to do now is take it away.  Well, the lawyers have decided that, God forbid, you're drinking Diet Mountain Dew and somebody  gets some spilled on their clothing, we could be held liable for a cleaning bill.  Sure. 
[00:38:30]  I hear you.  I hear you.  Unbelievable.  I'm sorry that, you know, some of you guys don't like to bitch him, but I don't know  what to tell you.  Well, we do like bringing you into this show and into what we're dealing with on a daily  basis.  We probably should feel really good about ourselves because the last couple of days was pretty  amazing.  But I now know, this is why we brought it up, it'll just go back to where it was before  that.  And, you know, the PR department stuff could have maybe pushed this forward a little bit  to make it, you know, last a little longer and maybe, maybe, you know, get the show a 
[00:39:00]  step higher or something.  Or the company could have done that and they just choose not to.  And they never will make another decision.  And they never will make that right move.  Oh, I know.  That's not okay with me anymore.  You know, it's just not okay with me anymore.  JJ in New Hampshire.  JJ.  JJ.  Morning, boys.  Morning, JJ.  Hey, going back to the whole LeBron thing, the rumor is that Richard Lewis, he used to  play for Orlando, not sure where he is at this point, but the rumor is that he slept 
[00:39:30]  with LeBron's fiance during the playoffs.  A lot of people are skeptical because last year when Boston knocked them out, the rumor  came out that Delonte West had slept with his mother.  Yeah, two years in a row in the playoffs, there's this weird thing happening with LeBron  James.  Maybe he's a really jealous guy and somebody knows that and they get these rumors started.  Wow.  Maybe he's one of those guys that freaks out and is possessive.  Oh, very good.  But then again, why with his mom last year and not, who knows? 
[00:40:00]  Well, his mom is a little, you know.  It's embarrassing.  Maybe it's embarrassing and he can't handle the embarrassed.  It's kind of embarrassing.  His mom's been a bit of an embarrassment to him.  Has he?  Oh, yeah.  He's just a head case and the media is not covering it because already in the playoffs  this year, he was asked a question, Dwayne Wade was asked a question, LeBron called it  retarded in the microphone.  And then the other day someone asked him why he only scored eight points and he basically  was like, I did everything else on the court. 
[00:40:30]  You need to start looking at maybe next time you can ask a better question.  No, that's a really, you know what, if you're going to be put up to the level of a Michael  Jordan, yeah, that's a great question.  Why did you only score eight points in a playoff game?  Fucking, I hate Scottie Pippen.  What a dope.  LeBron James has absolutely not proven himself yet in the playoffs in general.  And you got Scottie Pippen saying he's better than Michael Jordan.  Go fuck yourself.  He certainly is not.  You need the mental game too.  And LeBron James is proving he just doesn't have it. 
[00:41:00]  He resented being in Jordan's shadow all those years.  And now he's trying to show that he's his own man and he's independent.  Yeah, good for you.  I hope it fucking bites you in the ass.  LeBron James in the fourth quarter yesterday won the team need him most because Dwayne Wade  was kind of injured with a hip thing, but he came back into the game.  He scored two lousy points.  And I think the only two points he scored was almost when it didn't matter, right?  I was reading in the paper today.  There's a couple of good videos of him taking major league flops this year in the playoffs. 
[00:41:30]  I believe one's called LeBron is a bitch and the other is LeBron flops again.  If you can find him, it's clear that he's never even touched and he just dives to the  floor.  Yeah, he's a head case, man.  I don't know if this rumor is true with Lashard Lewis.  I don't know what the deal is, but the fact is he's a head case two years in a row now  in the playoffs.  Scottie Pippen looks like a Mr. Potato Head.  He really does look like a Mr. Potato Head.  He looks like African artwork.  One of those masks. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, his face is long and his nose is long but wide and thin.  He's awful.  He should be on a totem pole.  He's awful.  All right, yeah, but mainstream media is not covering, obviously, the Lashard Lewis rumor,  but man, that was like almost the number one Twitter trend yesterday.  Everyone was discussing it.  And LeBron James, when he's not playing, walks around like he's Clark Kent.  He has these big, over-the-top, black-rimmed Clark Kent-type glasses. 
[00:42:30]  And I think that's on purpose, by the way.  Superhero?  Yeah, I think he's basically saying, look, when I'm not playing, I'm just a Clark Kent guy.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  What is that?  He's doing the Jay-Z glasses.  Jay-Z.  He got it from Jay-Z.  Oh, my God.  Jay-Z has earned wearing weird glasses like that.  Yeah, LeBron James hasn't.  Takes his clothes off in a phone booth, giant N on his chest.  For what?  What?  Why would he have an N on his chest?  By the way, I don't like those stupid glasses Jay-Z is wearing. 
[00:43:00]  Because what that is, is that's the alternative comic thing where they pretend they don't think  that they're beautiful and hip.  Like, hey, I'm just an ugly, stupid nerd.  But meanwhile, they think they're quirky geniuses who are handsome.  That's that.  Like, hey, guys, I'm just a regular guy, kind of a nerd.  You know, but deep down, he thinks he's the coolest motherfucker on the planet who can  overcome nerd glasses.  Right.  Buddy Holly.  That's good.  Buddy Holly had that thing.  Yeah, exactly.  I think he actually needed it.  I think he actually needed it.  I think he actually needed it.  I think he actually needed it.  I think he actually needed it.  I think he actually needed it.  I think he actually needed it.  I think he actually needed it.  So the black community, that's the thing? 
[00:43:30]  These big, over-the-top, black-rimmed glasses.  Are they popular?  Is that new?  It must be.  Is that a new thing?  Gazelles were popular years ago.  Remember Gazelles?  Gazelle glasses?  Nobody?  No.  Tango hat?  We weren't a member of the Lords.  Oh, that's true.  You didn't see the gang shit.  No, if I saw the actual glasses, I would go, yes.  I don't know.  That was a big name in the early 80s.  83, 84.  Look up Gazelle glasses.  So we all go, ah.  Gazelle.  Yeah, they were big.  I know I bumped out a couple guys today, Gary and Rob, but the fact is, you guys probably 
[00:44:00]  should have pushed PR to maybe see if they could have done something with all that press  we got the last two days.  And to be honest, I did get a couple of, wow, that was really cool that that happened.  Yeah, from those guys.  That's nice.  From those guys, yeah.  I said that.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  And I did, too.  I got, you know, good job.  That was great.  Awesome.  From those guys.  Gary said there's a lot of press, a lot of great hits from, you know, he sent emails  and Rob made a remark. 
[00:44:30]  But again, they're the cute guys.  They're kind of just cute.  The cute guys.  It's amazing how ugly guys can be cute.  That's hilarious.  The cute guys.  They're just, you know, not cute in a way like, you know.  No, it's just cute.  They walk around.  The other definition of cute.  It's just cute.  Yeah.  And play workplace.  Right.  Like kids.  Yeah, yeah.  Like kids running around.  Yeah.  Isn't it cute on commercials when you see a kid in a suit and tie?  And, oh, Uncle Paul.  It's kind of like.  And they're talking like, hey, you, that report is due. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  And the other guy's like, I'll work on it.  And they're kids.  And you're like, oh, that's adorable.  I got an even better example.  Right.  Now that I'm a father.  It's going to come a time where I'm going to have to, when I start playing stuff with  my kid, I'm going to have to let him win.  Oh.  Oh.  So we walk around every once in a while, kind of let them, like.  Let them win.  Let them think they might be in charge and all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, it's like, oh, okay.  They're like the babies in the stock commercials.  Yeah.  They're in a crib.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're in a crib.  Oh, you're a baby.  You're not going to do anything.  Oh, come on.  Your golf game stinks. 
[00:45:30]  What are you talking about?  You know, I invest with E-Trade.  But like, you know, they're just a baby.  They're just babies.  They're just cute.  They're saying all these things.  Yeah.  But you know there's crap in their diaper.  That's pretty much it.  I get it.  My nephew is a really good baseball player.  He's been playing since he was three or four.  He's now 13.  He's really good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what.  I don't know if he's.  Whatever.  But he is really good for his age.  Okay.  I remember when he first started out, we would pitch the ball and there'd be a little  bunt and he had to run at first base.  And you would like run and like, oh, God, I don't know what I'm going to do. 
[00:46:00]  And you fumble the bunt.  Meanwhile, you can get him out in a second.  Yes.  Yes.  That's what happens around here.  You just fumble the ball a little.  Look, we bobble the ball to make you feel good every so often.  Exactly.  Okay.  And just to make this really hurt.  This isn't a bit.  No.  Because sometimes they get confused.  Oh, those guys are doing a bit on management again.  Oh, this isn't a bit.  Oh, those guys.  You guys are just kind of cute. 
[00:46:30]  Cute.  And then the guys that really matter, they're too busy backing up a fucking money truck to  Howard's area.  Keep up the good job.  You worked three out of the last ten days.  You're doing great for the company.  Young Sam is just putting up baby pictures.  Just baby pictures on the computer screen.  They're sad babies, too.  Sad babies, too.  They're crying babies.  No, no, no.  You can't beat.  We can't have any exceptions.  Can't make any exceptions.  Oh, no, no, no. 
[00:47:00]  Can't make any exceptions.  There's no rule bending.  There's no exceptions.  There's this fear of setting a precedent that I heard.  There's no exceptions for performers on the platform.  There are exceptions for other people on the platform, but not for performers.  And when you're doing something artistic, and believe it or not, this does fall into  that category.  We don't know what we're doing on a daily basis.  Things are very fluid.  You can't put these strict rules.  There are some that have to be adhered to.  We understand that. 
[00:47:30]  But you can't just put these strict rules that apply to everybody.  These blanket-like rules on something that is so free-form and flowing, it just inhibits  it.  Eric Logan knew how to look the other way when it was important.  Right.  Simple as that.  We're not talking about looking the other way during a bank robbery.  No.  It's just something that works for the show.  No, looking the other way in a corporate environment in such a way that it wasn't going  to be some big, huge problem. 
[00:48:00]  It's not going to be an issue.  Exactly.  It doesn't have to always go to, we have a problem.  That's real management.  Right.  I'm still friends with Eric.  That's getting the show.  I'm still friends with him after...  Dude, I'm just hoping fucking Oprah kicks his ass out that door and he moves on to something  that we can be part of.  Once he stopped drinking, I had no use for the motherfucker.  But he's a genuine guy.  He's not a despicable guy who's out for himself.  He's really a genuine guy.  He knew how to accept dick pics that were mailed to him.  Yes, he did. 
[00:48:30]  Love of God, he loved them.  He would never just run into me in a bathroom and go, oh, we need to get you guys out there  with wireless mics in Times Square.  That is going to, that's going to stay with me right up until the end of this fucking contract.  I'm looking at him like, wow, you just don't know what we're about.  And then I throw it in his face.  I'm like, would Howard just fucking walk outside with a wireless mic?  Well, he did that, Union Square.  I'm like, no, that was because he was announcing to the world he was coming to satellite radio.  That was a big fucking deal.  That's why that made sense. 
[00:49:00]  But he was trying to compare his suggestion for us and how we're doing it.  It's two different things.  Are we John Montone?  I don't know.  I'm thinking wireless mics in Times Square.  Really?  Opie and Anthony here in Times Square.  Absolutely, John.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  That's a great, that's a great grumpy baby picture you found there, Sam.  Thank you.  Sad babies.  Sad babies.  No, it's got to be sad babies.  They are hysterical. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, that's Mickey.  I know him.  Oh, you do not, Uncle Paul.  I sure do.  They're not grumpy.  They're not grumpy down the...  Oh, get on Melissa there.  Go back up.  Yeah.  She's inquisitive.  She looks very sad.  But what's even funnier in the context of the way you're portraying, it's not just the  sad babies.  It's the context that you're...  Yes.  The comparisons you're making is what's so funny.  Sad babies.  Holy shit. 
[00:50:00]  Because they're helpless, you see.  A sad baby is totally helpless.  Patch in Burbank.  Burbank, California.  Check it in.  Beautiful downtown Burbank.  Burbank.  Who was that guy with the great voice?  That was the guy from Ronan Martin's Lacko.  Gary Owens.  Gary what?  The Gary Owens.  Gary Owens.  Thank you, E-Rock, because I was...  I felt like I almost had it.  I was waiting.  From downtown Burbank.  I was waiting for my computer screen to maybe give the answer, but that would have come  at some time, I guess a quarter after seven, I would have gotten Gary Owens. 
[00:50:30]  No, it's still not coming up.  Wait.  Wait for it.  Yeah.  Gary Owens, yes.  Patch in Burbank writes, Howard's side of the building?  Looks like Scrooge McDuck's money bin.  That's Scrooge McDuck's money.  Patch.  Oh, that's great.  It's true.  And like I said, because his fans will now attack us or me, whatever.  God bless him for getting that deal. 
[00:51:00]  God bless him.  Yeah.  I mean, really?  Uh, it's time for shock jocks to disappear.  Hmm.  This Mary Elizabeth Williams is just another dummy.  She's a broad writing about what's funny, and of course, she's not going to think...  Well, she played one of her cards in this article, which just discounts everything she's writing  about here, by the way.  Yeah.  When an explicit photo of Anthony Weiner's purported package hit the web Wednesday after 
[00:51:30]  Andrew Breitbart shared it on the Opie and Anthony show, America was stunned to learn  that Opie and Anthony are still relevant.  Hey.  That hurts.  It turns out the only thing more persistent that Weiner's dong is the allure of the shock  jock.  Wait.  It turns out the only thing more persistent that probably should say that than Weiner's  dong is the allure of the shock jock.  The allure of the shock jock.  Now, um...  Ladies and gentlemen, be very quiet.  We are coming to the shock jock display. 
[00:52:00]  Uh, they can strike out.  Has our relevance dropped the last few years?  I would say yes.  That's her?  Yeah.  I would say yes.  Ew.  Is that her natural hair color, you think?  I don't know.  Blow that picture up.  Let me see her a little closer.  I don't know.  I want to get a bigger view of that.  Um...  She's like a chick I used to fuck.  Why?  I know.  I know.  Believe me. 
[00:52:30]  What's that key do?  Does that key unlock her heart?  Ugh.  Ugh.  She's got a key around her fucking neck.  She's got a big key around her neck.  What is that?  An oldie time key.  One that you could look through the keyhole?  Yee.  Yeah, yeah.  A younger version, but she kind of looks like a...  Ugh.  She probably didn't wear a bra for a while, too.  By the way, Salon.com.  Yeah.  Aren't they the ones who had the transcript?  Didn't they have the transcript at all, but they kept X-ing out the parts that are profanity? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  They're shocked journalists.  I believe they did.  It's amazing the nerve of these fucking people in the media to criticize the way anybody behaves with information.  Yeah.  Why was that relevant to put out the transcript of what this guy said that's sexually explicit?  Why would you need to put that?  Yeah, I don't know.  Come on.  Stop it.  We're shock chocks.  Can't do anything.  Our relevance has dropped over the years, but we're certainly still doing very well. 
[00:53:30]  Dude, the relevance is all radio because there's so many medium outlets now.  It's like you can go to YouTube and say things.  There's so many ways to give and get information.  Right.  All single outlets have dropped as a relevant thing, and it's balanced.  It's the way it is.  TV, too.  And no one really gets big press anymore unless it is something over the top, by the way.  Right.  When you're doing your job day in and day out, it's hard to write about it.  Radio's changed.  Amazingly so.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Boy, you feel good. 
[00:54:00]  You got my real name in your article.  Yeah.  Why isn't it Anthony?  By the way, no one calls me Greg, you stupid dope.  Why isn't it Anthony Cumia Cumia?  I would like that because I don't have a name.  You need some kind of wacky...  I need a wacky name.  You need a wacky nickname like myself.  I need some kind of zany name.  By the way, you know how embarrassing it is that I'm in my 40s with the nickname Opie?  Anthony, Anthony Cumia.  Yes.  That'd be good.  Anthony in parentheses.  The second Anthony, by the way.  How about Anthony Cum's on your Cumia? 
[00:54:30]  Ah, because it's C-U-M.  Yeah, you play it.  I like that whenever I'm calling a pharmacy or something like that.  It's like...  The first three letters of the last name are C-U-M.  And I giggle in the phone like, ah, she just spelled cum.  Oh, it's hysterical.  Oh, so you got Opie and Anthony have never had the king of all media cachet of Howard  Stern, but like a slew of other...  Yeah, it's going to be tough for anyone to have a career like Howard Stern, but guess 
[00:55:00]  what?  We did pretty fucking damn good, man.  We did really well, and we continue to do well.  I have no regrets except not fucking that girl with the braces.  Oh, back at AM.  Yes.  Cachet of Howard Stern, but like a slew of other radio bad boys, their infantile shtick  has proved surprisingly durable.  Surprisingly durable, you stupid bitch, because we do way more than just shocking things every  once in a while. 
[00:55:30]  You know, but that takes intelligence to figure that out.  She doesn't know what we do.  She doesn't know our show, obviously.  She knows what she's heard about our, like, over-the-top shit, the church thing, the mayor  thing.  She knows that, but she doesn't know this show on a daily basis.  When we go serious and talk about real issues, we do a great job at it, and dare I say a  much better job than a lot of the mainstream idiots out there.  Yeah, because it's a lot more honest.  We're able to be a lot more honest.  But that means Mary to maybe listen to this show on a regular basis for a little while 
[00:56:00]  to form her own opinion and see for herself instead of what you've heard over the years,  you dope.  She's got to pick which key necklace she's going to put on.  She's going to be listening to the show.  But the fact that somebody would write about shock jocks, who uses that anymore?  I know.  Someone that's out of touch.  It is ridiculous.  Someone that's out of touch.  Fucking embarrassing.  Shock jock.  Holy shit.  Like, that's the article?  Shock jocks must go.  Right.  Wow.  That's great.  1991. 
[00:56:30]  What a relevant article.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was in a speakeasy the other night, and I saw a shock jock.  I never think of shock jocks.  Well, no.  Mary Elizabeth Williams, first of all, all the shock jocks have disappeared.  There was a time, I think we kind of started, to be completely honest with you.  The planes were full of them, Opie.  Oh, yeah, they were.  The shock jock was roaming.  Like Buffalo.  The planes of the Midwest.  And they just all got gunned down.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Somewhere around the time we did the Sex with Sam thing, the whole radio world was changing. 
[00:57:00]  That might have been the event that put it over the top.  I don't know.  Herds of shock jocks.  But that was a big, big event for radio in general.  Yeah.  And all these guys that were in the shock jock category, including ourselves, had to either  adjust or they were going to go away.  And most of them have gone away.  Everyone could think of some shock jock shows they used to listen to or know of that are no  longer on the air because they could not adjust.  Yes.  And that's what we did, you stupid bitch. 
[00:57:30]  We adjusted.  Can we be shocking still?  And do we have that card?  Yes.  But we don't play it that often anymore.  Very hard.  Because we had to adjust, you dope.  I just, just the idea of her thinking in that terminology is just, it's just, it's a  lazy, it's a mentally lazy, out of touch writer.  Yeah, but this is a, this is a, this is a Google thing today, man.  This is, this was a Google alert today.  It's not a dumb little, small little blog article.  Imus has a great head of hair. 
[00:58:00]  Yes, he does.  Doesn't Imus just have a great head of hair?  He should comb it like our Bud Dwyer.  I just saw Imus on TV and it's like, God, he's got a great head of hair.  But his asshole looks like a train wreck.  Oh, Jesus.  So, you know, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  Love Imus.  I think he told, uh, nevermind.  Yeah.  I hope he knows what he's doing.  I'll just say that much.  I'm sure he does.  I hope so.  Because I love the guy.  Uh, has proved surprisingly adorable. 
[00:58:30]  Surprisingly adorable.  Cute.  Yeah.  Uh, the duo who've been coasting on their formulaic combination about outrageous stunts,  biting impressions, and guest nutjobs for 16 years now.  Biting impressions?  Well.  Great.  Great.  I do all dead people.  First of all, outrageous stunts, not so much.  What's, by the way, I would love her to name one outrageous, what is an outrageous stunt  besides something that you've read and you think sounds like journalistic and good to 
[00:59:00]  write?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What is outrageous?  Right.  Why is it not outrageous when any other media outlet releases this stuff?  Yeah.  Why is it not an outrageous stunt when the New York Post, when your fucking website prints  all of these transcripts from this guy's private life?  Right.  Why is that journalism or information giving, but when this show releases something, it  is considered an outrageous stunt.  Yeah.  And, uh, your example right there is definitely more shocking than a guy drinking eggnog and 
[00:59:30]  puking, by the way.  Yeah, please.  And, uh, with that said, since we moved into this building a little over two years ago,  I can't even really think of a, uh, what was it?  A outrageous stunt we've done.  Outrageous stunt.  We can't even get anybody naked in here.  Right.  It's not a...  And as far as guest nutjobs, you want us to list all the guests we've had?  Is Larry King a nutjob?  Maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe.  But he's a big fucking A-lister.  Yeah.  Please. 
[01:00:00]  It starts with that.  Sugar Ray Leonard.  Do we have to name all the amazing guests we've had lately?  A-listers?  Vincent D'Onofrio, who caused the entire debacle for Vincent D'Onofrio.  And they're writing articles that he, uh...  I know he's responsible.  We might have to get into that a little later.  It's just one dummy.  Yeah.  One dummy.  One idiot.  For 16 years now, have been fired, fired, and canceled for their behavior.  Yet still remain persistently on the air.  And then she brings back the April Fool's stunt with the mayor thing in 98.  Then the, uh...  98. 
[01:00:30]  I was thinking the other day when I was, uh...  Did it hurt?  I was thinking the other day, riding my bike.  It happens every four years to us.  Oh, yeah.  98.  202.  Yeah.  2002, excuse me.  Homeless Charlie, 2007.  So that was about five.  Yeah.  And now, uh, 2011.  Wow.  Every four to...  A little over four years, we're good for one.  We're like locusts.  We've had four big, huge fucking events now.  Uh, but she adds the 2006 eggnog drinking contest that ended predictably with a contested 
[01:01:00]  vomiting into somebody's mouth.  Yeah, that would...  Come on.  I'm not predictable about that.  That's predictable?  There's nothing...  You cannot predict that was gonna happen.  We didn't know.  We didn't write that down.  There's nothing predictable about that.  Joe Rogan fucking just blurted it out that he should puke in someone's mouth.  But again, of course, that fucking trying to look younger than she is...  Oh, yeah.  Uh, uh, fucking online writer.  It's not meant for you. 
[01:01:30]  Mm-hmm.  You're not supposed to think it's funny because you're not funny.  You're not a funny broad.  Why would you enjoy that?  Well, she tells us what she thinks is good, though.  To their credit, though, they did get Louis C.K. to ask Donald Rumsfeld if he was a lizard  from outer space.  That's sort of shocking stuff there, Mary, isn't it?  We're not even allowed to play that audio?  What?  Why can't we play the...  I was told a while ago it involves bodily fluids and... 
[01:02:00]  What are we not allowed to play?  The eggnog audio?  The eggnog challenge thing?  Who told you that?  Who told you that?  It happened already.  I was told by Gary, he said, the lawyer said, because of the bodily fluid thing.  Bodily fluid thing?  Does anyone honestly think we would get sued or get a fucking...  Get some type of FCC?  It's satellite, first of all.  That there would be a problem with obscenity or something?  It was done on terrestrial radio.  Yes, we did it on regular radio. 
[01:02:30]  You dummies!  It was done on terrestrial radio.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me look at the flow chart.  Did you do good?  Yes, it was good.  It was very entertaining.  A lot of people talking about it.  People are talking about it.  So I got to go to yes.  And it was a YouTube sensation.  Yeah.  I'm steering clearer than no one on this, though, because did you do good?  I believe we did.  I have to go to yes.  Let me now go down.  We have a problem.  Oh, boy.  All right.  It's we have a problem.  I thought that time maybe there was another step before we have a problem.  That's what I thought.  But the flow chart doesn't lie.  I would love for.  And I went to I went to a silly SUNY school and you're and you're I'm a high school dropout. 
[01:03:00]  And you're dopey lawyers.  What is it?  Eight to 12 years.  Something like that.  It's crazy.  It's crazy, right?  I would love for one of these guys to come down here and debate me on this.  Yeah.  And I'm the dumbest one in the room.  I have no problem admitting that.  I will fucking debate you.  How is it that something that was played on regular radio, like Jimmy said, and was done  already?  It's the past could possibly be a problem if you replay it. 
[01:03:30]  And I'm willing to say explain that to me.  I'm willing to say I will bet every dime that's left on my contract, every fucking dime that's  left on my contract, that there would never be a fine levied against this company for playing  that audio ever.  What they're afraid of is some obscure because we're everywhere.  And what what's obscene here, it's it's it's lawyer garbage done by it.  It's stuff that is put out by lazy people who don't want to have to to think their way 
[01:04:00]  through something.  There's nothing worse to me.  And this is a generalization than a fucking lazy blanket statement attorney.  There's nothing that makes me sicker to my fucking stomach than a lawyer like that, who just  makes blanket statements.  Oh, I can't do that.  Yeah, because I we dealt with them at CBS.  They're dummies.  I remember talking to them.  We're not pornographers.  We're not good attorneys either.  You can't even debate me.  I'm a high school dropout.  You moron.  I say I remember sitting in that room with him and our dumb fucking PD, that overrated 
[01:04:30]  fucking PD, and I'm not and our overrated GM who just happened to have a fucking massive  radio star under his fucking belt.  And our fucking overrated head of the company over there who was supposed to save things  and then just emasculated the whole fucking talk division.  Cut the balls off of the whole fucking thing.  All of them were dopes.  Yeah, we were there because they wanted to try to cut our dicks completely off that day.  I have a question. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  For everyone listening down the halls and stuff, because I know they listen.  They can't help themselves.  Of course.  They know this is great radio.  No one can.  I want anyone that is listening to my voice right now in this company.  See, there's no one down the hall right now.  So they're all in their offices cowering and scared that they might be asked to do something  that they know they're not capable of doing.  Thanks for the sad baby pictures again.  Yeah, please.  That's a sad baby. 
[01:05:30]  Anyone.  And I mean anyone.  Other radio guys, office people, engineers.  You are putting the word out.  I'm putting the word out.  Anyone here at SiriusXM that is not scared of their own shadow, please walk forward.  They're petrified.  Every single person here is scared of their own shadow.  Well, when the carpet is made of eggshells.  Guess what?  It's an amazing thing.  Guess what?  I'll fucking pat ourselves on the back right the fuck now. 
[01:06:00]  We're not scared of our shadows.  And when we saw an opportunity to put our names way the fuck out there, we didn't even  think twice.  Yeah.  It was taken.  We got to fucking mend some relationships, but we didn't think fucking twice.  But we have a problem.  Like I said, it would lead to a problem.  If this company, by the way, was in charge of NASA back in the time of Apollo 13, there 
[01:06:30]  would be, to this day, a capsule orbiting the moon with three skeletons in it.  Because we have a problem.  Ah, we don't know.  Just three skeletons in space suits.  I love your analogy.  There's a lot of humor there.  People are laughing.  Of course.  But you gave the company way too much credit.  Really?  That it actually got off the pad?  Yes.  I think this thing, from 1969 until present, present day, would be sitting on a launch pad 
[01:07:00]  with a bunch of guys going, scratching their head, lawyers saying, I don't know, the smoke  might, somebody could complain.  What do we, I, if we, I, Can't play the environment.  I, uh, I, I, Serious, we have a problem.  What's the problem?  Uh, we're still on the pad. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  We've been here for a while.  It's okay, Jim.  You sit, just sit tight.  We'll get back to you in a few more years.  But I'm now 80 years old  I was a young guy when this started  I'm 80, we have the equipment  We'd really like to use it to its full potential  Can we light this candle?  No!  No, the lawyers say no  I, uh  I, uh  Confused baby pictures now 
[01:08:00]  Oh good  The baby's got his giant baby head in his hands  And he's like, I don't know what to do  Sure, but you gotta show him  Oh, Uncle Paul  And we're not even  We're not even asking for much  No  We're not asking to go back to the old days  We understand things have absolutely changed  But wow, have you pulled way the fuck back  You've pulled more back than you have to  Is basically our theme here  You can't play?  We can't play audio that already happened 
[01:08:30]  That's all over the fucking place  They want to make history go away  It's hilarious to me  No, I found out when we were looking at the duty war stuff  Like, big boy makes a duty  You can't play that?  It has to be edited  Oh, you have to edit on satellite radio  You have to edit  That was done on terrestrial radio  Bodily fluid  There's a policy with bodily fluids  And this all came up in a discussion  A policy  No, but the policy should  Isn't it things that are happening in the studio?  Yeah, you would think 
[01:09:00]  The policy  So wait, we can't play  Hold on, if there's a news story  Where they show somebody vomiting  We can't play that news story?  No, no  If there's a news story  That I don't know  Or if there's a clip  Say there's a clip from a movie  Like, here's a scene in Clockwork Orange  Right  Where Malcolm McDowell comes home  From raping and doing whatever it is  Those sweet boys would do  And he's pissing into the toilet  It's a behind shot  Right  We cannot play the audio from Clockwork  On this fucking radio show  That I do not know  How about we get an answer on that  Because that's a bodily fluid thing 
[01:09:30]  From a rated R film  Right  And that was a real piss  Because Malcolm has said it's a real piss  Yeah, how about this?  The baby's vomiting  On America's  On ABC  Oh my god  There's a clip  You fucking dumb  Lazy motherfuckers  On ABC  Of babies vomiting  Vomiting babies  In the guy's mouth  There's a baby  Vomiting in a guy's mouth  It was on ABC  On ABC  That's pretty much  What we did with adults  Yes  But we can't  Can we 
[01:10:00]  Hold on  Can we play that?  I don't think so  We can't play  That clip from ABC  But the point is  Ew  Babies are disgusting  The point is  They don't want that type of  Radio  That's fine  I guess  Because you're running the place  But to actually say  We can't play something  That already happened  That's where you completely lose me  That's ABC  And that was  America's Funniest Home Videos  Or one of those shows  So all the satellite radio  Subscription holders  That happen to be listening  Right now  That's what this 
[01:10:30]  You can't play  A bodily fluid  Vomiting audio thing  But on YouTube  There's something from ABC  Where children are vomiting  And baby  We technically  Cannot play that  But it can play on  ABC  ABC  The most emasculated place  Network television  Yes  But here  We can't play it  I was told  I was told that  If it's the policy now  It applies to material  Currently  Future  And stuff that's happened  In the past  In the past  Uh huh  I would love  I would love  Would love 
[01:11:00]  Somebody to explain that one  I would love  I would love to hear that  Well someone go down the hall  Isn't one of the guys here today  Yeah  Like I said  One of the cute guys  Are here today  Every dime left on my contract  I will wager  That if we played  Uh the vomiting clip  That they would never  Have to pay a fine on it  What's a fine  What's a finable offense  It's theater of the mind  You're hearing something  Right  Right  Back to uh  You know it did happen  Amazing  Sam ran down the hall  Um  Back to it's time  For Shock Jacks to disappear  By Mary  Elizabeth Williams 
[01:11:30]  As we look at her  Fine picture  I'm reading her Twitter too  She's terrific  We're attacking everybody today  There's something  Both blatantly offensive  And uh  Quaintly old fashioned  About the shock jock  And about the idea  That men like Don Imus  Who in 2007  Referred to the Rutgers  Women's basketball team  As a pack of nappy headed hoes  Why  Do people that  Try to come across  As intelligent human beings  Don't understand  The Imus situation  To this fucking day  It might not be  Your sense of humor  But that was a fucking joke 
[01:12:00]  And a funny one at that  Why don't intelligent people  Understand that yet  Four years later  Because she's a lazy writer  This is lazy referencing  It's lazy  He was going for  An edgy joke  She knows that  You stupid fuck  She knows that  Or Bubba the Love Sponge  Who said after last year's  Devastating earthquake in Haiti  That the county  Ought to  Tap the hooker market  To get things back on track  Maybe half a million Haitians 
[01:12:30]  That will end up  Not being around tomorrow  It's a cleanse  Are still  Gainfully employed  I don't understand that one  I don't know what  She  She's saying  Why when people  Make these jokes  But look what she references  As brilliant satire  And she's right  It is brilliant satire  But the nerve  This is what's  Everything that's wrong  With people like this  What she likes  Is brilliant satire  But what radio guys do 
[01:13:00]  She finds tasteless  Right  It's a sickening double standard  And plus  Yeah  I would tell Mary Elizabeth Williams  If she came on our show  But you know  That ain't happening  Because she'll hide  Yeah you could point out  Maybe something  Bubba the Love Sponge did  Or something we did  Or something Imus did  But you gotta  You gotta look at  Their whole body of work  Yeah  Exactly  Yeah you could point out  A day that we said  Something horrible  Yeah 
[01:13:30]  Or a day  Bubba the Love Sponge  Said something horrible  Or a day  Imus said something horrible  Do you realize  When Imus did  The nappy headed hoes thing  Nappy headed hoes  He had  Sorry I did that  He had everybody  From the political world  On a show  On a regular basis  Mary  Elizabeth  Fucking Williams  Yeah  So his whole body of work  Was pretty damn impressive  Yeah  And then he said something  That got him fucked  Unfortunately  You'd think after decades 
[01:14:00]  Of FCC baiting  And outrage  Inciting  The pee pee poo poo  Radio format  Would by now  Seem as dated  As a 30 year old copy  Of truly tasteless jokes  And as boring as  Well  The jocks themselves  Oh god  Come on  But it turns out  That for a certain audience  Sexist  Sexist gags  Comparing women  To toilets  Just never gets old  In the age of serious  Where jocks are 
[01:14:30]  At long last  Free to say shit  On the air  The anything goes  Douchebag  Seems downright  Indestructible  Oh  Sweet freedom  Of speech  Exclamation point  What was perhaps  Once an outrageous  And  Archaic  Rock and roll style  Seems now just as lazy  And bored  As a hooker  In an on air  Hot dog eating contest  It's not just  That being vulgar 
[01:15:00]  And outrageous  Can't be fantastic  But Opie and Anthony  Possessed  None of the crazed  Jackassness  Of a Johnny Knoxville  Which she must like  Or the politically naughty  Brilliance of South Park  Which she must like  We've done some  Intelligent South Park  Type shit on the show  You stupid bitch  But again  It's her opinion  On what she likes  As an acceptable satire  Of course  Even Howard Stern  For all his  Wiener press conference  Crashing  Has  Wait  So  When Howard Stern's  People  She's okay with them 
[01:15:30]  Even Howard Stern  For all his  Wiener press conference  Crashing  Has the  Impassioned air  Of a man  Who occasionally  Bounces talk  Of Blumpkins  With an impassioned  A very  Personal investment  In free  Amendment freedom  First Amendment freedom  Because she likes it  And again  That's why  She's a pig  And a lazy writer  Because when  You start  Separating stuff  Like that  Like well  What he did  Was this kind of  Insightful  Free speech thing 
[01:16:00]  But what you guys  Did is disgusting  It's because she likes him  And doesn't like the show  But she won't  Just come out  And say  Look  It's all the same  But I like this  I don't like that  She has to make it  Like there's a  Legit reason  Why one is legit  And why one is not  I shouldn't have said  Legit three times  But you know  That's what she's doing  Compare any of that  With what went down  When serious journalist  Professor of cell phone  Penis shot  Andrew Breitbart  Possessor  Sorry  I gotta eat by the way  I'm fucking shaking 
[01:16:30]  My blood sugar level  Just dropped  If you need to know  I'll try that again  Compare any of that  With what went down  With serious journalist  Slash possessor  Of cell phone  Penis shot  Andrew Breitbart  Says his host  Used a surveillance camera  That's in the room  And did a screen cap  Of it  And put it out there  These people have admitted  That they did this  Sera-petitiously  Sera-petitiously  I know her  Sera  And illicitly  And they lied 
[01:17:00]  In the process  Saying that they didn't  Even have a camera  In the place  It's an unusual assertion  Given the fact  That it appears  His visit to the show  Is being openly recorded  But Opie Hughes  Likeway  Asserts that  Breitbart  Did not want  This picture to be released  Perhaps Breitbart  Had confused a show  That has conducted  Christmastime  Homeless shopping sprees  With the Jim Lahren  News Hour  What's wrong  With the shopping sprees  That we're not able  To do anymore  Also  Great  I remember  Yeah 
[01:17:30]  Remember those  I forgot  We used to do that  Big news  Big crowds  Of their wiener  Tweeting shenanigans  Opie Hughes  Took to YouTube  Wednesday  To explain that  After a fan  Grabbed an image  Off the video  And sent it to them  It was a race  To see who could  Tweet the picture  The fastest  Yeah that's honesty  That's exactly what happened  That's exactly what we did  Unfortunately I don't think  We were thinking  Alright the rest of my quote  That's them in a nutshell  There's no joke there  No punchline  Not even a question  Just a bunch of guys  Sitting around  Looking at another guy's 
[01:18:00]  Penis and laughing  That's long past the point  Of being shocking  And it sure as hell  Isn't funny  It's just pathetic  And very very tired  Yeah there was no punchline there  That was something we did  Because it was extremely newsworthy  That everyone else  Was trying to do  Huge fucking story  It was extremely newsworthy  That's what that was about  If CNN or Fox  Would have 
[01:18:30]  Like  They were all trying to figure out  How to put it out there  I mean  They were all just trying to figure out  How they  They put the penis picture out there  And save face  That's what that was about  Because it's us  It's you know  Shock jocks being shocking  Yeah but there was no punchline there  We were the ones that  You know  Put the damn picture out there  Because it was an extremely newsworthy event  For a lot of people  Exactly  And we took our fucking shot  Correctamundo  Alright 
[01:19:00]  Why don't a couple of  Guys eat  Yeah  I might pass  By the way  What's the answer on  By the way  By the way  Is here  By the way  We can  We can play  Stuff like Baby Bird  In clips  And discuss it  But it cannot be played  In its entirety  What's the difference  With that  That doesn't make it worse  It doesn't make any sense  In their minds though 
[01:19:30]  What's the difference  I think we should be able  To play it obviously  Because people might think  Here's why  But why were they allowed  Just a little bit of it  Here's why  Because that will establish  It was in the past  And that's happening right now  Because we're discussing it  And kind of like  It was an event  Oh Jimmy look out  Wait Jimmy  I'm not feeling good  Oh I just puked  All over Jimmy  Stop  I just puked  All over Jimmy  I'm sorry  Oh my god  Oh no 
[01:20:00]  Vomits everywhere  Oh I'm sorry Sam  I hit you with my vomit  Wait a minute  Oh no  Travels  There's puke everywhere  Why did you eat this  Is that a problem  Yes  Fuck  Yeah we're off the air right now  Morons  Fucking morons  And they're silly little  Little pea brains  They  Why would they think  That's okay  I've been told many times  That just because  It happened back then 
[01:20:30]  Doesn't mean it's okay  To replay it  Absolutely  If we couldn't  By the way  Can somebody down the hall  Explain  Uh oh  How that vomiting baby clip  Let's  Can we play the audio  Of the vomiting baby clip  Yeah you can do that  You can cover  It has to do with  What happened in this studio  I see  But it didn't happen  In this studio  But it didn't happen  It happened on terrestrial radio  In this studio  It happened  You dummies  On a place where they  Fucking play cars  For kids commercials  Incessantly  You blithering idiots 
[01:21:00]  If you couldn't get  If you can't get away  With it now  That doesn't make it  Okay  That you got away with it  But again  We can't get away with that  Oh because it happened here  In the studio  So we can't get away with it now  Basically  It's not a matter of the studio  It's a matter of  Holding an event  Where the purpose  Is to vomit  But that wasn't the purpose  The purpose  Was to drink as much  Eggnog as you can  But because somebody died  Since then  Right  We can't  Oh I see  I see  They can cover it 
[01:21:30]  As an event  And  Not have the event  And  And  And  Yeah  I got two things  Yeah  First  They're running this place  Like Russia  No  Russia I think  Was the only country  That was able to  Actually adjust history  And make people believe it  Yes  They actually adjusted  Their own history  Yes  Revisionist history  Very good  We got Dennis  In Westchester  With this  Dennis  Go ahead  Go ahead  Dennis  Two weeks ago 
[01:22:00]  When Howard was off  For the 15th time  This year  Yeah  They played the grossest  Week ever  And they were clips  From the 90s  And that wasn't  That long ago  Right  Well they were probably  Discussing it  They were probably  Discussing it as a clip show  That's what their article  They were discussing it  As events that occurred  No grossest  It wasn't a clip show  It was a best of  No it was  No it was the grossest  Week ever  The clips were 25 minutes longer  Yeah it was best of  The clips were 25 minutes  Oh you know  You know what that is  I'll tell you what that is  Yeah  Because Howard was able 
[01:22:30]  To get complete control  Of his channel  Yes  So people who do not  Understand anything  About what they're doing  On radio  Cannot affect  What he plays  On his channel  Yep  I believe that's what  That's what happens  When an artist  Has creative control  They make their channel  A certain way  And it's entertaining  Yeah  You have a girl  Forcing herself  To throw up  All over your chest  That's great  But I'm saying  That's what it should be  Look man  They were clips  25 minute clips  That's why  But what's the difference  Between that  And playing Baby Bird  Which is a little  Yeah it's the same thing  Do you just want 
[01:23:00]  My guess  Yeah  My guess is that  They would say  Howard wasn't working  For Sirius when that happened  We were working  For XM when that happened  That would be my guess  I don't know  If that's the correct answer  Why would that matter  Why would that matter out there  To the people  That might cause problems  It doesn't make sense  It doesn't matter  It wouldn't matter  I'm not saying it makes sense  No you are Travis  No I'm definitely not  I should throw up on you again  You can't do that in here  I know  Of course not  So he had gross  Thank you very much guys  He had gross out week  And we can't play Baby Bird 
[01:23:30]  One of the greatest things  We've done as far as  The shocking category  We showed it in front of  10,000 people at PNC  Yeah  That's true  I forgot about that  How many fines were levied  Can I say thank God  I'll say thank God  For this place for one thing  My mortgage is paid in full  Oh bro  I'm 100%  Yes  Clean  Wow  I do not at all need it  It's amazing  That is fucking great  Do you understand  How beautiful that is  My God Jimmy  That's why 
[01:24:00]  I dumped every dollar  Into principle  It's going to be sad  Because I know what this could be  And  It's not going to happen  It's just not going to happen  The magic of satellite radio  Was the fact that  We were able to do  All these things  That we could not do  On terrestrial radio  But  So what are they going to  Cat videos are hysterical  What are they going to  What are they going to do  In a couple years  Is this just going to be  One giant jukebox  I guess  I guess that's what 
[01:24:30]  They're going for  One big jukebox  But will that  Will that be successful  With everything else  Coming up  I don't know  What like  Fucking Rhapsody  Like iPods  Yes  That's what people  Want to do  Pandora  Smart move  The Wi-Fi  Is  The Wi-Fi  Is  They're now  Wi-Fi-ing  Every single park  In the New York area  Yeah  The iCloud  The iCloud  iCloud coming out 
[01:25:00]  Like they're going to  I hope they know  What they're doing  That's on them  Not me  They don't understand  That the only thing  Separating satellite radio  From any of those  Other mediums  Is original programs  Not music  It's original content  Original content  Original content  Which is talk radio  People coming in  And very organically  And naturally talking  And they're just putting  The what I call  Kaiposh  On that whole thing  With these restrictions 
[01:25:30]  And legal  Legalese  That they throw at us  And if they think  That that's going to work  They're loco  I say  Crazy  Cuckoo  Jimmy's slumping  It's a level of disgust  Which is just  It goes beyond  I can't even  It's like you  You can only for so many days  Put a positive spin on it  In your own mind  It literally is  Utter  An utter  Creative lack of respect  That I feel  Not for me  But for them  It's a baby 
[01:26:00]  On a computer  I told you  I knew how to do that  Yeah  He downloaded those pictures  Didn't he  Uncle Paul  Yes he did  That's hilarious though  Can I  Babies doing things  That management would do  There was  Of course  There was three giant things  That happened to us  In the last week alone  Yeah  Okay we had the  The Paris Hilton thing  Yeah  And I  I on my own  Made a video  And put it up there  And the company felt like  That was a major problem 
[01:26:30]  Damn you to hell  You know  That video was gonna go  Everywhere  It still kinda went  Places  Because our listeners  Were smart enough  To take my video  And make copies of it  And I thank you  I thank you for doing that  Okay  Certainly  But that video  If it was just left alone  I guarantee  There was gonna be  No problem  From Paris Hilton's people  And that would have been  Another massive hit for us  Okay  We fell short on that  But that was a biggie  And that was another thing  That the PR department  Should have came to us about  Because 
[01:27:00]  That people were really curious  About Paris Hilton  Being such a dud  On our show  And they could have  Probably worked that  Yeah  Okay  You had that happen  That really just  Annoyed the hell out of us  Going what the fuck  Does this company  Understand anything  And then  There was the  Jim Norton  Not being able  To get the Lady Gaga  Photo  But it was the way  He was told  That just drove  All of us nuts  Including Jim Norton  Okay  Yeah  Drove nuts  By the  To interrupt you for one second  It was drove nuts  Is not even the term  It's kind of like  It's almost like  A level of calm 
[01:27:30]  Came with it  Like  A level of finality  That's how I feel  You know what  You know what  This is about now  Officially  It is such a  Loathing I feel  Yeah  That I can't  There's no coming back  From it  And then we do  The Wiener thing  And  They didn't know  How to capitalize  On that whatsoever  They thought  What they needed to do  Was put our faces  On the front page  Of Sirius  Sirius.com  Oh that's cool  Siriusxm.com  Oh that's great  So they felt like 
[01:28:00]  They did their jobs  There  Yeah  That's just in the  Last week alone  Yeah  Just  Nothing but  Disappointment  To be honest  With you  Big  Big things  Happening  And  Not understanding  You know  How to use that  And capitalize on it  And of course  The Lady Gaga  Is just a simple  You know  Simple case  Of just trying to  Take care of your  People a little bit  It never happened  Guys  Guys  It's been an hour 
[01:28:30]  And a half  Of just negativity  Could you  You know  Could you  Could you  Get a little positive  I mean  The good things  Are happening  Around here  Just look at  The flow  Oh  Oh  Oh  Wait a minute  That's the call  Believe me  That's the call  Here's positivity  Yeah  I  It motivated me  To write a lot  Yeah  Thank you  Yeah  Thank you  There are some  Residual ripples  It's a ripple effect 
[01:29:00]  That is good  That happens from  The bad rock  That's dropped  In the water  The ripples  Are good sometimes  All I ask  Is when  You start  Broadcasting  From home  In a year  Yeah  You just have me  As a guest  Every once in a while  Of course  Of course  Alright  It's  Man  I posted a nice picture  Last night  The lighting trusses  Are going up  So I want to have  All those  All those  Light stands  To bang into  Anthony's home studio  Is better than the studio 
[01:29:30]  We broadcast from  Every morning  It absolutely is  His microphones  Are way better  I ask for lousy gels  On these lights  Because they've  I think they're giving us  Skin cancer at this point  And they can't even do that  They can't even soften the lights  So we have to like  Dim them  As  We're almost in the dark here  Because that's the only way  I can handle these lights  You know why  It has to go through  So many channels  Instead of us going  You know something  We'd like some gels  On the lights  And then just have  Somebody go  Alright  They go online 
[01:30:00]  To a lighting gel  Place  And go  Here's some choices  We pick one  And then they  They order it  And they actually  Just put them on  Without it having to go  Through 50 people  Who will go  Yeah we'll get right on that  I explained it to them  Because I do try to work  Explain it to them  I do try to work  Around their rules  I really do  I'm not  I'm not always rogue  I do try to work  Yeah  Around some of this shit  Rogue  And I said to these guys  You know we all have  Really good cameras now  On our phones  You know 
[01:30:30]  With our  With our iPhones  And our  My matrix  And I  I just got an  Amazing HD video camera  But the problem is  With this lighting in here  And some of the colors  That we sort of worked on  A little bit  Yeah  Our pictures come out  Really shitty  Yep  Oh yeah they do  They actually do come out  Weird in here  Really shitty  And I said to these guys  A while ago  It's the lighting  Please give me some gels  Please give me some lighting  That's all it would take  Because some of these photos  Like if you got a picture  Of Paris Hilton 
[01:31:00]  In your studio  That could go places  But it always comes out  So shitty  Yeah  That there's no reason  For anyone to  Push the photo forward  Look at that greatness  I wonder what's going to happen  If I ever sell the house  What's going to happen  With that  Like  You better hope  Fucking Imus or Stern  Needs a place to live  No  Who else can afford  A place with a radio station  In it  You better hope  Fucking  A fucking  Ted Clear Channel  Is buying a house  Stern  Stern could use your house  As a vault  For his money  Yeah true 
[01:31:30]  When he runs out  I think you need more  Square footage for that  When he runs out of space  Oh Christ  Oh Jesus H Christ  He worked three  Out of the last ten days  Oh my god  That's fantastic  That's a dream come true  God would that be  Fan  Fucking tastic  Three out of ten  Oh  For way the fuck  More than we make  So you  You took a day off  Yeah  Yeah  I'm sorry we did that  We'll make it up to you  Is there a problem 
[01:32:00]  Yeah I was projectile vomiting  I didn't feel too good  So  Oh  First of all  You can't take off  Secondly  Don't talk about your projectile vomiting  On the air  Because we can't do that  Why can I  Just look at the flow chart  Alright  See you tomorrow  Maybe  Had it  It's so stupid  Had it  It's the  It's so dumb  No surprise though  By the way  No  No  This is exactly what I expected 
[01:32:30]  Of course  Exactly what I expected  Of course  Alright we gotta break  I'm passing out  Yeah yeah  We gotta eat  Because now when I get in trouble  For this  I'm gonna claim  Look  And I have witnesses  I haven't eaten yet  So I don't even know  What I'm saying  I can't think clearly  Somebody go for coffee  It's just amazing  When we get back Ant  Yeah  Barbara Walters  Why don't you send one of the interns  Oh that's right  We don't have  But they're getting right on that  By the way  From the meeting that we took 
[01:33:00]  Three months ago  I love the  I think it was about  Three or four months ago  They said we're making progress  Making progress  What are you fucking  They can't even figure out  How to bring interns back  To one of their biggest shows  They can't even figure that out  It's astounding  If I was like  In charge here  On the programming level  You know who I'm talking about  I would march right  The fuck up there  And talk to the proper people  And say  Look  Knock it off  It's a big important show  And they need interns  That's what I would do 
[01:33:30]  Hits one  Three new interns  Have started  Does hits one  Need three interns  Look I understand  They don't kick their interns  In the balls  But yes  Of course  With that said  I think we can  Move forward  From that event  Yes  The moving forward thing  Is what we have to work on  Holy fuckaroni  There's an alien on Imus  Oh is that Bernie  Holy shit  Frightening  Oh that was Combs  Oh I meant Bernard  Yeah Bernard  That's Combs  The bald guy

[01:40:30]  Well she does a damn good job  You could tell  But look  You would say that's a boy  You'd say that's an effeminate  Yeah  Man  But  Oh Jesus  Wow  I'm just looking at  Loverboy live  Outside  They're playing at Fox  Famous Dave's Barbecue  That's what they say  They join  Wow  And if you're in the neighborhood  Is Greg Gillis still playing  Drop on by  We've got a jam  Everybody's eating  For the weekend  Who's singing for Loverboy  E-Rock  Jesus  What happened to him 
[01:41:00]  Sorry E-Rock  I have to share the love  Around here  SiriusXM signs that say  We love Loverboy  We're just on  Are you kidding  They sent out the street team  They sent out the street team  To the Loverboy  Did they have signs printed up  Or are they handwritten  No they're on  SiriusXM signage  And I think they wrote  Like there's a white space  On the street  What whores  So that's it  They didn't go to like  The Gaga or Rihanna concerts  They went to the Loverboy  Just  Holy shit  They're outside the  Today Show window sometimes 
[01:41:30]  That's fantastic  Humiliating  That's wonderful  How humiliating  That's great  But that's what they  That was  Who's  Whatever  We're trying to move on  Who's the idea man  Behind that  Making a joke  Holy guacamole  What if you had a  SiriusXM signage  That says Loverboy sucks  Like that would be funny  Now that's funny  See that's funny  That's great  SiriusXM loves Loverboy  Do ya  So Stephen Colbert  Yes I want to hear this  I'm psyched  We got two days in a row 
[01:42:00]  With him mentioning us  Sorry to interrupt you  She just emailed back  Doesn't want to come on  And discuss her article  You wrote her?  No Travis did  The woman who wrote us  Baby  Of course not  But why would you?  You're a baby  Because you would lose  In a debate  But not even  I wouldn't even yell at her  Or argue  That's why  I said a debate  We would discuss it  With intelligence  And she would lose  I guarantee it  Blubber boy  Very good Jordan  Stephen Colbert  Day two  We got some mentions  So let's play 
[01:42:30]  I haven't heard this yet  I'm excited to hear this  Welcome back everybody  Nation  Thank you  Nation  I don't often say this  But I'm ashamed  Thank you  Last night I showed you  An X-rated picture  Of Anthony Weiner's penis  A picture that blogger  And journalist  Andrew Breitbart  Had in his possession  But said he would not release 
[01:43:00]  I'm trying to do the decent thing here  Not release the photo  I'm doing this to save his family  But it got out anyway  Which shouldn't surprise anyone  Based on this earlier picture  That penis clearly wanted out  Anyway  Last night I said that Breitbart  Released the photo  When he was visiting  The Opie and the Anthony show  But it turns out  Breitbart was just another victim  Of the gotcha media  As he explained on 
[01:43:30]  The Sustran with Greta Van Rekord  Jim  I went on the Opie and the Anthony show  I'm friends with one of the guys  On there  And I just decided  Before I went to the airport  Why not stop in  For some hijinks  Yes hijinks  As a journalist  Andrew Breitbart  Engages in only the highest of jinx  But unfortunately  Opie and Anthony's jinx  Are of a much lower quality  During the interview  They asked me if they could see it 
[01:44:00]  I said well make sure  You don't show it to anyone  And Jim Norton said  There aren't any cameras here  And so I felt very comfortable  That nothing bad would happen  With it  He was assured  That there were no cameras  And look at this footage  Of him with Opie and Anthony  I don't see any cameras there  And they're shooting him  Pretty close  If there was a camera there  I think we'd see it  Fucking brilliant 
[01:44:30]  Brilliant  Wow  Obviously a visual  But  Yeah  That's hilarious  The camera on Andrew Breitbart  That day  A couple days ago now  Was  I'm looking across  It was  Ten  Maybe  Not even ten feet away  That is hilarious  Yeah  Colbert rules  That's funny  We all know it  You can't even see  And they get in pretty close  And you can't see a camera 
[01:45:00]  That's brilliant  Oh  Is that fucking guy funny man  I mean the studio itself  If we put our arms like this  We can almost touch the walls  I know the walls  Almost  Oh god damn it  It's funny  And then part two  He did not know the photo  Would get out  Look at that face  It's so innocent  And how humiliating  For Andrew Breitbart  To have his private photo  Of Anthony Weiner's private parts  Just splashed out there 
[01:45:30]  On the internet  Without his consent  And I for one  Cannot believe  Opian and Anthony  Betrayed his trust  What happened to the sacred tradition  Of confidentiality  Between respected journalist  And shock jock  Time was  Edward R. Murrow  Could go on the air  With the morning zoo crew  Fibber and the Hepcats  And they never once  Released Murrow's photo  Of FDR  Is that a real show? 
[01:46:00]  Fibber and the Hepcats  Is that a real show?  That's hilarious  It can't be  No  Oh is that great  You never know though  The Hepcats  Very fucking funny  Oh my god  This is brilliant  How can I ever trust  A DJ again?  Is that even a real toilet  They're flushing?  Is there really a hot legs 
[01:46:30]  Contest at the beer bucket tonight?  And if so  Can I be sure  There's ten set wings  And ladies drink for free?  But folks  Here's why I'm ashamed  I myself showed this photo  Last night  And then  Again just now  Several times  On my show  But I did not intend  For anyone to see it  I was assured  By my network  That these are not cameras  For the last five years 
[01:47:00]  I thought I've been shouting  Into a toaster oven  How was I supposed to know?  I just wanted to have  Some hijinks  Anyway I'm sorry  And we'll be right back  God damn  Fucking great  That is great  It's really funny man  Jesus  Colbert is hysterical  He was great  On the Daily Show  When he used to  Do 
[01:47:30]  One of the correspondents  On that show  And the spin off  Is just  It's been hysterical  I wonder  I can't believe  He's been on that long  How long?  He said five years?  He said five  Five fucking years  Five years yeah  God damn  That's amazing  Very funny  Also yesterday  I think it was  Yesterday  The View  Was that yesterday?  No but it doesn't matter  The View  Listen to Barbara Walters  And her jealousy  Really?  Yeah  Oh yeah  Listen to this 
[01:48:00]  This puts a lot of things  In perspective  Yeah  A lot of people  Wanted to release that photo  Release the photo  They were just trying to figure out  How to save face  And do it at the same time  And this is The View  Discussing it  Mr. Weena  Was exposed yesterday  When blogger  Andrew  Bright  Bright  Bright  Bright  He's the guy  Who exposed Shirley Sherrod  That time  And he posed as a pimp  And went into the acorn offices  Remember that's Andrew Bright  Yeah  Well he showed his radio hosts 
[01:48:30]  Apparently  Opie and Anthony  The photo on his iPhone  Why he had it on his iPhone  I don't know  But he was proving  That he actually had  The photo  And the host snapped  A picture of it  Which is now  All over the internet  By the way  The networks all had that  I saw that picture days ago  And chose not to say  What a fucking bitch  I had  I said  First of all  You couldn't show it  On television  Barbara  You dummy 
[01:49:00]  I chose not to show it  I chose not to show it  Because it would have been  An FCC violation  And illegal  I chose not to break the law  And show the erection  Which never would have made  Television anyway  But you didn't choose to  I chose not to stand outside  And fly  But that's impossible  Exactly  You didn't choose  Not to flow it  To show it  Flow it either  That's right  Sorry  I got fucking Alice on the brain  I almost said mellet  Oh yes  My grits  Yeah she 
[01:49:30]  By grits  Do you mean hepatitis  I hope  There's an absolute jealousy  There too  You know  Yeah yeah  I had it  I had it  I coulda  I didn't  Really  Everyone saw it  A lot of people saw the picture  It's a matter of being able to  Get it  And do something with it  Right  I mean where did she see it  Where did she see it  Who else had it  Right  Why didn't the person that have it  Had it release it  Right 
[01:50:00]  A lot of news people had it  And once again  They were just  Either didn't have the balls  Or were trying to figure out  How to do it  And save face  Monetize it  I am  But do you see how she had to jump in there  Like  She probably did  Of the internet  By the way  The networks all had that  I saw that picture days ago  And chose not to  And you didn't tell us  Harvard  I'm not saying that  I'm just saying the girls  No but it's the girls  Why do we need to really  I don't know  What more is there  I mean  The thing is that  It's a naked picture of his 
[01:50:30]  Of his genitals  That's what it is  But how do we know  It's not Andrew Breitbart  There's nothing to prove  That that is Anthony Wieners  Is part of his face  Is part of his face in there Barbara  No his face is not there  Does it say Anthony Wieners  Is there a mole on the left side  I'm just saying  I'm just saying  I don't think  I don't think that Andrew  That Anthony Wiener has denied it  I think that  Way to take a joke literally  Back to my original point  Let me tell you something  It is  But even if he did deny it 
[01:51:00]  And she was impressed  By the size  That Barbara Walters  By the way  Do you not see too  This is really  Like Breitbart's not paranoid  Look at the way the media  Is really just going after him  When he's just  Like it's amazing  How they're attacking him  Continually  And ridiculing him  Because they have such a  And what Colbert said  Was funny  At least he's  You know  He was really funny with it  Just loaded with sarcasm 
[01:51:30]  Right  But it's amazing  How they constantly  Go after him  And they don't seem  To go after  Other people  Like if you exposed  Conservatives for something  They wouldn't go after you  This way  It's like  I mean  It sounds cliche  But it's true  The liberal media  It's just  That's what it is  It's amazing  How they're targeting him  When  Look  In fairness to him  He didn't want the photo  Out there  Or he would have  Sent it out  Or he would have sold it  He wouldn't have  He wouldn't have had it  Broken on this show  For no money  Yeah 
[01:52:00]  Why is King Kong on?  Put the news on  Oh see  Oh wait  Loverboy's back  Damn we just missed him  I just don't know  Why they are targeting  This guy so much  I mean  Talk about Wiener  He's the one  That was cheating  Or emotionally cheating  At least  If not physically  That's emotionally cheating  Here's how  A lot of people  Have brought up the question  Is this cheating?  Is this cheating?  Here's how you gauge it  Gentlemen  If your wife  Or girlfriend  Was doing the exact 
[01:52:30]  Same thing  Would you be pissed?  There  It's cheating  Yeah  Yes and no  What?  Let's just say  If she's sending her  Cunt pictures out  Well  If you think  You'd accept a file  That big  But you know what  If they want to  Say that  Is it cheating?  I mean  You know  If you're talking  About killing somebody  On law  Is it murder?  It has been  People  If somebody  Bullies somebody  To the extent 
[01:53:00]  Where they then  Kill themselves  People have been  Held liable for that  I don't know  About criminal charges  I know they've tried  And in certain circumstances  I bet it would be  You know  Murder by internet  I like your definition  I like your definition  Because some people  Would say  Nah that's not  And others  Certainly would  Say it's cheating  You've got to gauge it  By  Case by case  Really  When Clinton  With the blowjob  Thing  Is it cheating  And it wasn't sex  Well  What about  You know  Licking Bush 
[01:53:30]  Right  If some guy  Was licking  Your fucking wife's  Bush  Right  Would you be upset  And think it was cheating?  Yeah use the  I think so  Exactly  I think so too  So you know  Shit like that  How about if he was  Using all those force  To hold her ankles  Up in the air  And perform moral sex  On her  Fat fucking ankles  They're all going  After Breitbart  It's amazing to me  You shouldn't  He should not be  Even a part of the story  Other than the fact  But they just  Attacked him  And attacked him  He's not the story  No they'll  Continuously attack 
[01:54:00]  Anybody who  Shows liberals  Democrats  Whatever  For their foibles  God  It's like the way  They attacked  Ken Starr  Oh yeah  For going after  Clinton  Yep  Remember that?  Yeah  Because they would  Talk about Clinton  But they wouldn't  Actually really attack him  And they probably  Shouldn't have either  I could care less  If he gets  But you know what I mean  But anybody  Railing George W  Was held as a hero  But I don't remember  These 
[01:54:30]  The media going  After the male  Prostitute that  Exposed  Ted Haggerty  Say  Right  Oh I know he's not  An elected official  But I don't remember  Them targeting him  Yeah  For coming out  And being a prostitute  They didn't  They appropriately  Went after Ted Haggerty  And crucified him  They appropriately  Did not target  The male prostitute  Right  But in this case  They fucking  They go after  I wonder if any of them  Ridiculed  The male prostitute  Who had been  I guess massaging  Or doing whatever 
[01:55:00]  He was doing  With Ted Haggerty  The way they're  Ridiculing Breitbart  For  Why would he  Why would he  Yeah yeah  You could just tell  You could hear the  Disdain in their voice  And even if you hate  Breitbart  Fine fuck him  Don't like him  But the point is  He's not paranoid  When he says that  Yeah and  Wiener  Wiener's not  He's  I love the fact  He's not fucking  I like Wiener  I like him  Of course you do  Well you know  Can you put a dress  Over you sir  He's doing exactly  What we've talked about  Over the years  When you get a big  Scandal like this 
[01:55:30]  Play it out  Hang in there  And see what happens  In the end  This is a great  Experiment on  Don't collapse  To the pressure  Many times  Let's see  What happens  When you play it out  And don't leave  Don't apologize  Or  Well he's apologized  But you don't leave  The office  You stick with it  Play it out  And let's see  If this guy  Actually keeps his career  Yeah because I think  A lot of radio companies  Could have saved  Their radio shows  If they just hung in there  Because people just  Move on to other things  Eventually  His district is  Ridiculously democratic 
[01:56:00]  So he's not going to  Get thrown out  In an election  Right  The people are still  Going to vote for him  Enough time is going to  Go by where this is  You know old hat  And you get an earthquake  Or something  Gets right out of the news  Yeah  That's all it takes  Remember that guy  That we were all  Focused on before  9-11  I forget his name  At this point  Who's that guy?  Gary Condon  And then Shondra Levy  Remember that stuff?  Shondra Levy  Remember that?  They never went back  To that story  That story just  That was it  It was like a little blurb 
[01:56:30]  Like on page 57  Nothing  And that was a huge story  It was massive  And he didn't do it  He didn't do it  Absolutely  So all you have to do  It was some unruly  All Weiner has to do  Is hang in there  Until the next huge news story  He's just waiting  And then it gets a lot better  Because they're never  Going to go back to it  He clicks on the news  Every morning  And goes like  Come on  Come on  Shit  Nothing  He'll get some dirty looks  In the hallways  From the congresswomen  But  Yeah  Besides that  But if he plays this out  I think  I don't think he's going anywhere 
[01:57:00]  We'll see what happens  And apparently his wife  Even said  She wants him to fight  For his job  Well she doesn't want  To stay married  To an ex-congressman  Who showed his dick  What's your husband do?  He's a consultant  He used to be a congressman  Who showed his dick  Now he's a consultant  Who had showed his dick  Of course he wants him to stay  Got a point  Because she's in politics too  It affects her  What do you think  She wants to just look  At his big fucking nose all day  So what are you doing  Showing your dick 
[01:57:30]  No no no honey  I'm just consulting  I'm lying  Alright cool  Do you find it creepy  That they chose  The same day  That the photo was released  To announce that she was pregnant  Yeah that was  Smart  That was very smart  On someone's part  That's a PR  That's a real PR machine  By the way  Remember we were talking  About PR earlier  Damage control  Beautiful damage control  It's like  Alright what do we do  Well my wife's pregnant  Holy shit  Throw that out there  That blows everything  Out of the water  That'll push some of this shit  You know to the back  Cause guaranteed  That would have been 
[01:58:00]  Front fucking page  Like huge  Probably  Picture and everything  But they kind of  Pushed that aside  They pushed his weenie aside  But that's what  A real PR department does  Yes  They capitalize  Exactly  Exactly  Alright we got  Warriors  We got Ron and Fez  Talk about Roland crying  Oh  We got  Was that a gag?  I didn't hear any of it  Was it a work?  Was Fez  You know  Being  Facetious  Fez was making jokes 
[01:58:30]  But they were  At Roland's expense  Can we hear  I would like to hear that  Yeah because  Because we all know  Fez  Does cry a lot  On the Ron and Fez  Program  He does get upset  And cry  So why was he  Making fun of Roland  Who has cried  Once  He's had history  With Roland  He said that  Roland's crying  Was not  Legitimate crying  That it wasn't  Anything to cry about  Hey I was in here  That was real  Fucking crying  How uncomfortable was that  Yeah yeah yeah  Okay  The publicist 
[01:59:00]  Have a deep history  They weren't talking  For a while  You know  Just a couple months ago  Okay  Oh well  Yes  Dude dish  Dude dish  And now Roland  Went on the after show  Yesterday  Oh  And he  Said  He doesn't mind  Fez making fun of him  Because it was funny  But if he  And he said  It was the first time  Fez had been funny  In a long time  Oh  See but if Roland  But if Roland talks  And no one's listening  Did he really say it 
[01:59:30]  You were listening  Because you said  It was the after show  You were listening  You listen  I caught you on YouTube  You got me  I was listening  Can I address one thing  That I knew I would have to address  But I was falling asleep  If you remember my earlier conversation  That's true too  Yes sir  I'm sorry  No I didn't mean to jump in  No yes Mr. Norton  I was going to address this  When Colbert said it  But I didn't  Because the guy's like  Wait so you attack him  For saying shock jock  But laugh when Colbert uses it  And I knew we would have to explain this  Here's why  Here's why  I'm embarrassed  That some of these guys  Listen to the show 
[02:00:00]  Without intelligence  Well let's play it  This is why I laughed  And it's predictable  That somebody would say  Because it was the punchline  And everybody knew what he meant  He wasn't using it as  Got you got  It was the punchline  It's the punchline of a joke  It was the punchline to the joke  And wording wise  It was simply the best way to say it  Right  You can't  Because you can't trust  Radio guys  It doesn't work  Doesn't elicit  The information's the same  But it doesn't elicit  The laugh  That you can't trust  Shock jocks  Is a funnier way of wording that 
[02:00:30]  That's why  That's what the difference is  We're going to do a whole show  Where Jimmy explains comedy  To people  As soon as he said that  Yeah  It was a funny joke  I knew some dumbbell  Right  Would go  Stop listening please  Because he's not making  A 1997 indictment  That's why  Shock jockery  Yes  He's using it as a punchline  His whole bit  Was oozing with sarcasm  And that was a great punchline 
[02:01:00]  To the joke  He was also just mocking  The term shock jock too  Well he was  He was using it  Because that's the term  That's familiar  Right  With a lot of people  That are stuck in  Fucking the 90s  Yeah  It was a funnier way  To say it  Literally  Right  He would have said it  If he was doing  A serious news story  That's different  Because the wording  Of a serious news story  Is not built on getting a laugh  So you're not looking  For the funniest term  In a news story  Yeah  There's a big difference  Shock jock  Is a funnier way  To close out a joke  Than radio guys 
[02:01:30]  Or radio person  What do you mean  You can't trust  Radio personalities  Yeah  It doesn't quite work  Jimmy  Why is it funny  When the chicken  Ends up on the other side  Of the street  Because the misleading part  Is why did the chicken  Cross the road  So whenever someone  Is setting up a joke  You're expecting  A ludicrous turn  The ludicrous turn  Is what you're expecting  But what they're saying  Is to get to the other side 
[02:02:00]  So the ludicrous turn  Is actually logic  The fact that  There is no ludicrous turn  Is the joke  Because you're expecting it  And at a left field  Comes just the explanation  The obvious  The literal obvious explanation  Which is  Because a lot of times  Laughter is kind of  A joke is contingent  Yeah  On catching you off guard  Which is why  Guns and Roses  Can do fucking  Welcome to the jungle  For the next 30 years  But a joke  Doesn't have the same effect  Because you're not  Caught off guard  More than once  One more question  Sure  When someone says 
[02:02:30]  Knock knock  What if no one's home  Then the joke  Probably wouldn't work  Okay  It would be  Knock knock  Knock knock knock  Knock  Break in and rob them  Okay  Because this was going  To be a home invasion rape  Now it will only  Be a robbery  Okay  Because the white people  Are out  Lucky for them  Knock knock  Then it will be  Ring ring  Then it will be  Sock around the hand  Punch through the window 
[02:03:00]  Unlock the window  Climb in  Okay  And leave a semen sample  On the daughter's pillow  Because there's  Aggression there  There's aggression there  For the white people  I love  Jimmy explains the joke  Comedy  I love it too  I love it  Now that is  That's a sound answer  Thank you  This is what we're going to do  Because the Ronda Fest thing  Is involved in long  We should probably take another break  So we could do something quick  We could do  What's the ONA TV edit thing  All about for the people  It's something Danny put together 
[02:03:30]  It's based on those movie edits  Like that they put on TBS  Or whatever  Right  You know you're replacing  The curse words  With the words  You know  You get it  Do we play the original first  You think  I would think so  Alright  Because then we'll be able  To theorize  What are they going to  Replace that word with  How are they going to  Make this TV friendly  Okay so this is  Original ONA content  She's a real stick in the mud  Yeah  That's a stick in the mud  I don't know why  A stick in the mud  Yeah how did that become  Maybe it's an anal sex reference  Like when you're trying to fuck a girl 
[02:04:00]  And your dick actually goes in  And you pull it out  And it looks like  Like a fucking  Reese's peanut butter cup commercial  Gone wrong  Oh my god  You dipped your penis in my shit  Oh a lovely snack we've created  You got shit on my penis  Exactly  There's shit blood  And a little swab of paper  On my penis  Oh well look what you've done  To my asshole  Yummy snack time  It's not even seven  Yummy snack time  Now obviously a very funny bit  But if you want to put it on TV 
[02:04:30]  You got to clean it up  For everybody right  Yes you do  So that same audio  With some TV edits  The following portion  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Has been edited for television  She's a real stick in the mud  That's a stick in the mud  I don't know why  A stick in the mud  Yeah how did that become  Maybe it's a Tex-Mex reference  Like when you're trying to fire a grill  And your beans actually go on  And you pull them out  And it looks like 
[02:05:00]  Like a funny  Reese's peanut butter cup commercial  Gone wrong  Oh my god  You dipped your beans  In my dip  Oh a lovely snack we've created  You got shit on my beans  Exactly  There's shit  Blood and a little swab of paper  On my beans  Oh well look what you've done  To my burrito  Yummy snack time  It's not even seven  The Opie and Anthony show  Starring Eric Nagel  Continued  Sex bagels 
[02:05:30]  I don't like that  Because it's like  It's not the original bit though  They're playing the second time  Yeah  It's different words  TV friendly  I don't get it  Version  It's very funny  My burrito  I think we also should play  Sex man reference at the end was good  It really was good  You want this day in ONA history?  Yes  Yeah what happened?  And I have a brilliant charity idea  Oh yeah I want to hear that too  It's a good one  This day in ONA  The Opie and Anthony show presents 
[02:06:00]  Presents  Presents  This day in ONA  In ONA  Our favorite moments from this very day  In Opie and Anthony history  It was one year ago today  Wrestler Iron Sheik abruptly left the studio  After having his balls busted  By comedian Jay Moore  Wow he's all dressed up today  Jay Moore  We got the Iron Sheik in studio now as well  The Iron Sheik  Is he still champion?  He is the champion  Iron Sheik  Can you hear me?  I can  Yes 
[02:06:30]  You listen to me good  You're a no good son of a bitch  Piece of shit motherfucker  Fuck you motherfucker  You're a piece of shit yourself  You can come suck my 10th fucking inchcock  Fuck you  You're a piece of shit garbage  Come here I'll put in the camel crush  I'll fuck your ass  I'll make you humble  I know you'll do it in my butt  Because that's the only way  You can get an erection  Fuck you piece of shit  Yeah come on man  I'm right outside  Come on motherfucker  I'm here too 
[02:07:00]  Wake up stupid  You sound like a moron  Fuck you  I don't want to fuck in the dance every year  Hey  Iron Sheik  Get back here  Iron Sheik  Hey get back here  This has been  This day in ONA  In ONA  Our favorite moments from this very day in Opie and Anthony history  We haven't had him on in a year  Yeah  Yeah  Wow  We're not missing anything  Damn  Blithering idiot  We did what we could with that guy  I talked to his guy  Eric Sims  At the last wrestling convention 
[02:07:30]  And he said the Iron Sheik's ready to come back  Is he?  Of course he is  Yeah  Good  Of course he is  I forgot  He's ready to come back  Get that booking done  I will  Alright when we get back  Ron and Fist talk about Roland crying  The warrior talks about Hulk Hogan  And Macho Man's death  Oh yeah and the reporter flub was really good  Yeah  And my charity idea  You want to do it before or after the break?  We can do it before it's very quick  Alright go ahead  It's the five  This is Jim Norton's idea  So if it happens I want one 
[02:08:00]  It'll only work for very rich people  The five presidents photo  We have Obama  We have both Bushes  We have Clinton  We have Jimmy Carter  I believe those are the only living presidents  Now Obama would be the X factor because he's an active president  But what you do is you arrange to get the four former presidents into the White House  And you have President Obama there  And you charge people a million dollars to take a photo with all five presidents 
[02:08:30]  Holy shit  All five presidents  Guys like Spielberg  Guys like DiCaprio  Guys that can afford it  Because that is an impossibility  And you don't have an 8x10  You get it a good size  You know 11x30  Whatever size you want  You have it blown up to that size  And then after you do it  You charge an extra  If they want it  An extra 250,000  To have all five sign it  And the way you would do that 
[02:09:00]  Is you have them printed  And you have a courier  That would go to them  And bring these photos to them  And they would sit there  And it's for charity  And if you do 100 people  You've raised  100 million  125 million dollars  And there's a lot of people that could afford that  And that's an extraordinarily rare item  I just  I thought you were going for some goof  But that's a really good idea  That's a great idea  Jesus  There's a lot of people that have that type of money  Just laying around  That they would spend in a second  Knowing it's going for a good cause 
[02:09:30]  Yes  And to show that they have a huge fucking dick  To their family and friends  Because now they put the photo up in their mansions  Or what have you  I love the idea  That's an amazing idea  And again  Only the ultra rich could do it  But again  It's for charity  And it's something that  Yeah it's a million 250 for a photo  But with five presidents  There's no better photo  You would easily get 100 people  Easily  Easily  And it wouldn't take  Literally to get people in 
[02:10:00]  You'd have to do it on a great digital camera  To get somebody in there and out  You could probably do  A couple of minutes  If all they get  They get to shake every hand  They stand in the middle  They take a photo  And they have to leave  You could probably do two a minute  It would probably take  You know  An hour  Tops  And then when they sign it  But it's for charity  So they would do it  It's 125 million dollars  Even if it was an afternoon for these guys  What else are they doing?  Come on  Well Obama's  The other guys you could get in one area 
[02:10:30]  But it would have to be on a day  When they knew Obama would be in the White House  Right  And there would have to be a contingency plan  If Obama was called away  If there was a disaster somewhere he had to go  But the White House is secure  You wouldn't have to go  Any extra security  Because the White House  Is the most secure place on the planet  And everybody pays their own way  Everybody pays their own expenses  And the courier gets it signed  And he does  That's where the pictures  That's a great idea  The pictures are all handled a certain way  And you know  It's all set up 
[02:11:00]  For the former presidents  And the active president  See there's just a negativity around us constantly  Jake and Jersey  You only get one pic for one million  What is the cause?  Well it depends on the  There's people out there  That have so much fucking money  Yeah they would pay a million dollars  For that particular picture  Without a doubt  They wouldn't even think twice about it  It's that photo  And the cause  There's a million great causes  They would figure out one that makes sense  Whatever it is  Children's  Sid  And then he goes  Obama gets to waste the money on gun control 
[02:11:30]  Again he's irrelevant  This guy's irrelevant  That's why those screens should go  That guy should have no voice  He should have no voice  He doesn't have a voice  He should yell at his radio  Goodbye  Yell at your radio  Yeah those people  I don't care what they think  Goodbye  Whatever the cause is  Predetermined and agreed on by all five  The presidents would have to agree on it  Such a solid idea  I like it  It's a great idea  It'll never happen but I love it  I saw a photo  I think it was the Reagan Library  And it was Reagan Bush  And it might have been  Clinton, Carter, Ford  There was five presidents 
[02:12:00]  When Ford was still alive  And I'm like  What an amazing photo  Now you wouldn't get within a mile  Because of the security  For five presidents  So it would  You know  That's not the craziest idea  And that is possible  Because all four former presidents  You could pick a date  A year in advance  Or six months in advance  The only X factor  Is of course  Illness or death of the family  And President Obama  And then people would have the choice  That is  That's my idea  I would like this marked  In case anybody steals my idea 
[02:12:30]  A-Rock  I would like this audio  Mark it  Marked everything  I want no money for it  I just want one of the pictures  As long as you go  Mark  It's marked  It's marked  That's 125 million fucking dollars  Man  But I think  Or different bands  Different bands should do it  Because Kiss does the thing  Of meet and greet for a thousand  Or whatever  Which is alright  It's hard to get a photo  With the band  But if the fucking Bono  Wants to raise money  And you too  How about you four  Take fan photos  And you charge a tremendous  Amount of money  But again 
[02:13:00]  All the money is going to charity  All you guys have to do  Is stand there  And people who could afford it  Would pay $10,000  Or $15,000  For a photo  With you as a band  It's a very rare item  For very rich people  That's where you gotta start  The president thing  Is almost out of reach  But not impossible  That's  The president one  Though you can never get  If you're a promoter  You can get your two  You can't get a president  I love your idea  On a lower level  Even  You do it  Different ones  The president idea 
[02:13:30]  Is for guys like Spielberg  For guys like hedge fund people  Who could get three of them  You know  These guys  These CEOs  They make fucking  $170 million a year  Some people  Warren Buffett  If you get Mick Jagger  And Paul McCartney  For an afternoon  Yeah  And conventions do that  Right  But if you charged  $15,000 or $20,000  And people knew  That the artists  Were not keeping it  It's not a greed factor  It's a very rare item  And again  A lot of extra money  If you want it  Signed by both  And it can't be personalized  Because you can't have 
[02:14:00]  These guys writing  To different  They'll both just sign it  At a later date  That's a great idea  Now what do we do  Photo with me  $1.75  Ooh  A dollar if it's signed  A dollar if it's signed  I'll sign it with  Pre-seminal fluid  I hope the lawyers  Here don't get involved  And go  Oh that can't be a contest  Wait a minute  Stop it  Don't even mention it again  Of course  So if that idea  By the way  Is stolen by anybody  I will sue the cock  You know most of those people 
[02:14:30]  Don't even come in  On Fridays  Oh no  Of course not  There's no one here  We're the only dumbest  That's still  Look at the hallway  It's empty  There's no one here  It's amazing  Because the place  Is running so well  They figured  You know what  We should all just  Take Fridays off  In the summer  Yeah  How much for a picture  With the Stones  All four  I'm not saying  Would you pay or I pay  But what do you think  Well the Stones  Kidney  The Stones is a weird one  Just because  The 
[02:15:00]  I got it  Kidney Stones  Oh god  I didn't even get that  Of course you didn't  I thought you were just saying  That's how much it would be  Kidney Stones  The line up of  The joke felt like one  Yeah  Of course it did  The line up of the Stones  Has changed so much  That that's kind of a  That's a tough one  Mick Charlie  Ron  And Keith  Those four  That's a solid four  Right there  And the fifth one  Who's the one  When you said Stones  I'm thinking the current  Line up of the Stones 
[02:15:30]  Bill Wyman was one  Right when did he leave  20 years ago  Oh no  Wyman didn't leave  20 I don't think  No no no  Definitely not  But you throw him in there  If he would do it  He would come back to do it  Maybe  Charlie Watts isn't with  The band anymore  Oh did he just retire  Oh yeah  I mean with Charlie Watts  Yeah so you'd have to get  Like the nucleus  What year  92 he left  Okay so 20 years ago  Bill Wyman left  Almost 20 years ago already  19  No  Wow  Holy shit  So it was built  With Bill Wyman 
[02:16:00]  And Charlie Watts  Of course  Wow  How much do you think  People would pay for that  Um  Is that a $50,000 item  I don't know about that  But  Yeah I think so  Because of the rarity of it  Really  I mean again  If you have that kind of money  People buy paintings  For $800,000  No they don't  You're right  I lied  I made that figure up  They buy art forgeries  For $800,000  You dopey Steve Martin  Yeah Steve Martin  That's what he deserves  He got swindled 
[02:16:30]  Exactly  I'll quote my own tweet  That's how I  Now you know how I felt  After I saw the new Pink Panther  Get us an art forgery  Yes an art forgery  I felt ripped off  An asshole who quotes himself  Alright  Alright  Why don't we  I pay $100  See  Some guy said he'd pay $100  Alright fair enough  For a photo with all of us  That's more than it's worth  Get that for nothing  And a nice compliment  Okay boys  Line up  Yeah I know  Really  Line up boys  Line up  We suck 
[02:17:00]  We got iced tea coming in  And cocoa  So we got a break  Because we're going to run out of time  To get some of this other cool stuff  On the radio today  Damn yo  Ron and Fez audio  And hopefully  Hopefully the Warriors audio  After the break  Sirius XM  The Virus  What's his name?  Breitbart  Breitbart  He seems like an idiot to me  I mean just  He doesn't seem like  The brightest bulb in me  Whatever  So if you go into  Opie and Anthony's studio  They are now my heroes  By the way 
[02:17:30]  With your cell phone  And pass it around  To those guys  And Jim Norton's there  Duh  What are you nuts?  Okay you promise guys?  I mean  Anthony had to jerk  The phone away  From Opie  Because Opie  Was trying to take  A picture of it  With his phone  Oh no  Come on  And then  Of course  As soon as  Then their video camera system  In the studio  Got it right  Lou?  Yes  They take it  Cementiously  Yes  Exactly  Okay  And then 
[02:18:00]  They were fighting  To see who could tweet it first  Good for them  That's what they do  I mean  Come on  We would have done  The exact same thing  Won't we?  Who would have thunk it?  Opie and Anthony  Then they were  Sooner then  And then  Whatever  This is the  Opie and Anthony show  Ah good job with that man  I love Amos  Hey uh  Ron and Fez  Yeah what up?  I'd pay a hundred  For those guys  Ron and Fez  Photo of Ron and Fez  Photo of Ron and Fez  Um  Roland had a breakdown 
[02:18:30]  On our show this week  Oh  Anthony  Was it a breakdown?  It kind of was  And I was  I was listening to  I don't know if it was a replay  I don't know where I heard this  Did you replay it?  Yeah  Maybe Sam replayed it  And uh  And basically said  This place is gonna kill people  The stress and the pressure  Yeah yeah  The stress level is just  The stress level in this area  Yeah  In this place is ridiculous  It doesn't need to be this stressful  It doesn't  And it finally got to Roland  And Roland broke down a little bit  Had a real moment on our show  Which we like  We like the real moments 
[02:19:00]  Absolutely  Yeah  Especially when it's over something  Of substance  Why are you calling him  You're like Sex Man now  It's his new name  Where did that  How did that come about?  Because it's been Sex Bagel  It was Sex Bagel  Then it was Sexy B  Then it became the Sex Man  And fans are calling him  The Sex Man on Twitter  So once a name  Wow  Takes off  How many fucking nicknames  Does this kid have to have though?  Amazing  The Sex Man  That's his name now  What about Sex Bagel  And Hawk  Oh Hawk  Things develop  Hey Hawk  I forgot about Hawk

[02:20:30]  The stress of this place  Is gonna kill people  It's just gonna kill people  There will be corpses  From people just fucking  Dying of stress  Well that's why I'm  I'm sorry  That's why I'm out of here  In a year  I have no problem  Alright we're back  Wow  Oh that was hard  To listen to  He was  He was getting a beating  Behind the scenes  Yeah  Something we had no idea  About actually  But  Alright  So  Ron and Fez 
[02:21:00]  Certainly took the opportunity  To kind of have some fun  With that  I meant it on that  I mean recently  We did a whole thing  On the blueberry incident  So  The blueberry incident  You can't blame Ronnie  Certainly  For bringing it to his show  Knowing there's a little  Beef between  Ron  And Fez  Their intern  Made a blueberry  Incident song  On his first day  He came in  With a blueberry  Incident song  Oh no  What happened  Fez responded by saying  This is gonna be  A long internship  Oh damn  He wasn't happy  Well  Here's Ron and Fez  Oops

[02:24:00]  You was all big time  Fez Whiteley  You know  And now you're  Just sitting there  Being quiet  Why did he break down  Um  Sometimes he locks up  Locks up  They call it  Yeah  He locks up  You're locking up  There buddy  You're locking up  Yesterday Ron asked him  Who he liked to be with  On the air  The most  And he named two people  And then Ron said  Who else has been in here  And then he said  I don't remember  I'm locking up  I can't think right now  Locking up  Is that what happens now 
[02:24:30]  He locks up  He locks up  Okay  He wasn't locking up  When rolling came up  No  No  No sir  Fez talks shit about rolling  Here we go  Let's go over here  To David  David you're on  The Ron and Fez show  Hey Ron and Fez  Welcome back  Yeah  I got a question for Fez  How are you going  Complain about rolling  Crying about guests  When you've done  The same thing  On your show  I don't know quite  What he means by that  But what were you saying  About rolling  I don't even remember that 
[02:25:00]  Oh with rolling crying  On the O&A show today  I just said  Total pussy move  Uh huh  Just sobbing about  The Glenn Close booking  On their show  Well here's what happened  He had booked Glenn Close  She's a big star  Fezzy  She's got Emmys  She's got Tonys  And nominated  Five times  For Oscars  Five times  That's a big star  I think for  For uh  Rolling to walk back  And tell her  Uh we're not 
[02:25:30]  Having you on the show  Would have been  Uncomfortable for him  Yeah but be a professional  There's no need  To be sobbing  In here  And just crying  About something like that  It's just ridiculous  I mean what  What is he  Two years old  Oh  Two years old  That's kind of hurt  A little  Yeah  Does that hurt  A little bit  Rolling  It's like that  South Park character  Like a Skittles  Yelling at you  You kind of like  Go huh  Like a retarded kid  Oh really  Oh the  Oh  A little effeminate 
[02:26:00]  Yeah  He made his  He made a limp  Wrist  That's what  Roland just did  A little limp wrist  And then Fez  Debuts his  Roland impression  This one is actually  I just smile  I like Jesus  If it takes him  This long to be funny  I'm like go ahead  Wow  Hasn't been funny  In a long time  Right Jimmy  He hasn't  Even management  Oh look  He's actually talking  And being funny  You're talking about Fez  Yeah  Oh wow  That's what he said  Back there  Management did

[02:27:00]  I'm sorry  But that's a long time ago now  Let him get over it  Alright well  That's fine  But the fact about  This Roland thing  I mean the guy  Does a hell of a job  He does  He came back  To O&A  They needed him  He's doing phenomenal work  Getting great guests  To come in  And then  Oh boo  Wait a second  Fez has the nerve  To start carrying on  Listen to that  Fez has the nerve

[02:35:00]  I don't go in a corner  I start shaking and crying  The management  And run away from them  So he'll have to be talked to  He does that  Can we talk to you  He says shaking  I'm like oh never mind  Never mind  We'll talk to you later  Wow  Man  This is like  Now it's getting personal  Uncomfortable  Now the gloves are off  Wow  This is like the warrior  And Hogan  Yeah  This is crazy  This is some  Unbelievable stuff  Adam 
[02:35:30]  Ronnie B  What's up man  Hey  How the fuck  Are you going to rip on Roland  Every time I turn on your show  You are always whining and crying  Oh you mean like this  Boo hoo hoo  Boo hoo hoo  You had me confused with Roland  For the ONA show sir  I don't know  Why he's gotten into Fez today  Why he's feeling stronger  And by the way  I want to see how Opie  Tries to turn this back on me  Oh  Opie's got  You know  Jay Moore got in Opie's  Fucking kitchen 
[02:36:00]  About oh  Ron's a puppet master  No one can control Fez  No one knows when Fez is going to have a good day  No one's going to  No one Fez is going to have a bad day  I don't even know  I will know this  When somebody hits the floor  When somebody most of all needs help  That's when Fez starts to stomp  This is as old as life itself  Fucking Ronnie  Ronnie  We discussed the Jay Moore part of this  I think in the after show 
[02:36:30]  Yeah  Ronnie was trying to throw me off the scent  Yeah  Yeah  I'm very suspicious of Ronnie being the puppet master  Yeah  And then he threw in my head  That Jay Moore got to me  And I was like  Oh yeah  Oh wait a minute  And then I'm like  Wait a minute  Now I know what he's doing  He's doing the puppet master thing  That was kind of the puppet master thing  Yeah without even  Deflecting  Realizing  Right  Yeah  So now I'm back on to him  Pull the strings  I'm back on  Pull the strings  I'm not saying he's the puppet master  I just got some suspicions 
[02:37:00]  Yeah  And now the Jay Moore thing  No no  That's over with  I'm back on the track  Fez starts crying  It's like if Fez starts crying  It's like the whole sky is raining  Wow Chip  That was uncalled for  I mean literally  We never called for anything like that  Roland I really appreciate you helping this bit along by the way  It's been great  I'm just so tired this week  Oh  He's holding a lot of stuff in  But without your input 
[02:37:30]  This pretty much just sits there  Like a bad fucking fart  You idiot  Just permeating the room  Right  With a stench of nothingness  Right  Sits here like a box of phones  That's crazy  Box of phones  See we're using the audio as a catalyst to get you involved here  You have to listen to the little things that he said though  Cause he's taking  Oh Roland  Yeah he's taking some pretty brutal shots at Fez  But he just kind of mumbles them and shrugs his shoulders  So you can't really  Pick up on it  Comment  Comment Roland  Comment 
[02:38:00]  I have nothing today  I don't know  He said Fez shakes in a corner  It's true though  That's what they all say  And the management is like  Oh stay away from him  He's crying  Oh my god  They do that  It means they're like  Who wants to talk to him  Because nobody does  Because he says a pain in the ass  That is the truth  Enough about me  We're talking about Fez right now  I know  That's what they all say  Someone goes  Do you want to talk to Fez  They go fuck  Fuck  They go do you want to do it  They're like no it's your turn  They're like oh Jesus Christ 
[02:38:30]  It's your turn  They're going to spin it on that show  I'm sure Ronnie will  That that means people are scared of Fez  Is that what's happening here  They just don't want to deal with this shit  They're like fuck this  It's like a cop at the end of his shift  Like should I pull that car over  Nah fuck it  I'm going to go home  So they don't want to deal with his emotions  Yeah I think so  That's what it seems like back there  You see three of them talking  Who wants to talk to him  Oh wow  You're getting really like 
[02:39:00]  Is that bad  Yeah I think you're going to  I think there's going to be some tears today  If someone hears this  There's going to be some tears  I figure if I have to have a meeting about this  I might as well make it worth it  Yeah  That's what I figure fuck it now  I need it worth it  I don't want to like  I skipped over this  Skipped over that  I said it  You've been around us way too long  I'm tired  That is the God's honest truth  Wow  We might as well go all in  Before the other three were like  You almost said it but you didn't 
[02:39:30]  And then I sat there for 20 minutes  Every other time  Is this true shit that goes on?  Yeah  Yeah the last one I did  Had to sit three or four times  Roland's closer to the  But why aren't you allowed to  Kind of do this type of thing on the radio?  Oh well no  Just like the offense  Like the last time  When I made fun of him  There's got to be more of this  More of that  Then the next day  Can we talk to you real quick  For two seconds?  But why would you make fun of him though?  If he didn't do anything to you  Oh no no  I didn't make fun of him  I just said about the publicist  What the publicist said  And then  They said  You shouldn't say that about Fez 
[02:40:00]  You shouldn't do this  I don't understand  What was said  That upset him  That you had to be called  Into a meeting  I said  He creeped out  And annoyed the publicist  That's what he said to me  Oh shit  He creeped  He creeped out  You don't know where this all began?  Yeah that's what happened  I have no clue  Literally the publicist goes  Roland can you see you  Who's that creepy guy  He's creeping me out man  Oh no  This is where it all began  That's where it began  What was he doing  That creeped out the publicist  What did the publicist say?  I heard he was just hanging around  I don't know  I was not there  I'm way in on this whole thing 
[02:40:30]  I've heard  I text on the phone  And then he looked up  Fez was this way  Then he went to sit down  Then Fez was that way  Then he went to take a call  Fez popped up over there  And the publicist sat you down  Said  What's going on?  He was in his eyeline  Yeah all the time  He goes  Hey buddy  Can you come here  Who's that over there?  I said  Oh he wants to talk to you  About this client  Just tell him  Just email me  I just don't want to talk  To anybody right now  I was like alright  Said it  But then he kept on doing it  And then walked up to him  And talked to him  And then he got a little annoyed 
[02:41:00]  The publicist  But then he was just having  A bad day too  I just said that  And then all of a sudden  It blew up to something  Way bigger  Way bigger  And then every day  Was like  Can we see you for two minutes?  Well Fez believes that Roland  At the time  Not anymore  Yeah  At the time  Fez believed that Roland  Had some kind of  Was developing some kind of  Conspiracy against him  That he was spreading rumors  I was the devil  Oh boy  Really  And it's been escalating  Ever since  Yeah and I  So when  When Fezzy heard that Roland  You know  Broke down 
[02:41:30]  You know  Yeah then  Obviously he's going to  Take a shot  He's going to pass  And the management  Well if you help book  En masse  We could put this to bed  I go what did I do wrong  You did nothing wrong  But  If you help out to do this  You can put that to bed  And I just said  For everybody  I agreed to everything  And then  And then it was  Another meeting  Another meeting  So now I'm like  If I have to go  To another one  I got to make it worth it  So  I have to sit there  For 20 minutes  And go  So what would you like  To say  That you hadn't  Said previous  About Fez Watley 
[02:42:00]  I mean  I have nothing against him  I'm just tired today  It is  Whatever  You're just a little tired  Yeah  Tired of the bullshit  You mean like tired  Of the nap  Or tired of the bullshit  Yeah  I think we're all tired  Of the bullshit  Yeah  Alright  It's a total package  I'm sure  That the Jim Henson  And Fez show  Will  Will  Oh because of all the puppets  What  Or the AIDS  No  God damn 
[02:42:30]  I want to make  Cigars and scotch  For that  Now calling it  The Jim Henson  And Fez show  Jim Henson  Was a puppet master  Well  He was  A puppet master  He literally  He worked  The puppets  He knew how to work  The puppets  I'm sure we haven't  Heard  The last of this one  Oh no  Yeah  Fez is not going to be happy  That the publicist's story  Was broken  I really want  Hopefully still save  The last 20 minutes  For radio  Fez was doing 
[02:43:00]  An impression of you  Would you like to do  Your impression of Fez  I think it's only fair  Maybe it'll save  I'll do  Hello Ron  Skittles  How are you guys  Oh my god  You look fancy  Anthony  How are you  That nice black hat  Oh let me cry  Chanel's not on sale  Go fuck yourselves 
[02:43:30]  I'm tired  Get a dick in the ass  And then call me on Monday  Then you'll be happy  Well we don't know  What Fez does  That has to be said  I honestly have  No fucking idea  Oh no  No idea  When  When are they  Going to play this  What is going on  That's fine too  Whatever  When are they going to play this  On the Ron and Fez show  Because I have to tune in  To hear  To hear the tears  On it  Roland has taken a turn  Since he broke down  Because honest Roland  Because he realized 
[02:44:00]  He was keeping too much inside  Yeah yeah yeah  So we're dealing  With the honest Roland  But you didn't do  The impression of Fez crying  He did the impression  Of Roland crying  How would that sound like  For Fez  It's like  He he  He  He  Um  Fez management's coming  Oh wait  Woo  Woo  Woo  Woo  They're gone  Anyway Ron  Let me tell you  Are you saying  Those are crocodile tears  Yes  Wow  Wow 
[02:44:30]  Roland as Fez  If  What  Batman character  Would you  Oh no  Would you  Why would you  Do this to me  Ronnie B  Why did you  Stop  Boopie  Anthony's involved  He's driving  Too fast  Home  We must call  Anthony  Where's Jimmy  Where's Jimmy  He loves me  Whoa  Roland Fez  I was just asking him  What character you would be

[02:45:30]  I would say I would be the Joker  Cause you know  A little fucking sociopath  Dear god  Why doesn't the man stop  I might have to call Matt and Trey  You might  You might have a voice  For South Park there  Oh okay  Now we made it  Into something  Alright  Wow  Oh  The sex man has  Ron Affiliate  No don't do this  No  Can we play the original 
[02:46:00]  Blueberry incident  So this makes sense  Oh yeah  I guess we have to  You got the original  Blueberry incident  From the Ron Affiliate show  All set  Here it is  Blueberry incident  Listen for a heavy breathing  Listen for a door closing  Supposedly that's Ron  Leaving the situation  I don't know  I was not there that day  But that's what has been told to us  Here's the famous  Blueberry incident  Once again  You're on a health food kick  I guess so  Yeah  Now the blueberry  Is one that can't work  On it's own  It has to have 
[02:46:30]  Something with it  Like the kiwi  It's not a  A standalone  Standalone fruit  The voice  Is going to get  The spot  After the Superbowl  The breathing  The door shutting  It's all classic  So it gets better 
[02:47:00]  They're a lot  Of interns  We're not  Yeah  We're still not allowed  But they're working on it  They're making progress  Was the last thing  I heard about  Four months ago  Yeah  One of their interns  Decided that  On his first day  This is intern  No name  He hasn't even named yet  And on his first day  As an intern  He came to them  Apparently  And said  I've made a song  A blueberry song  Called Blueberry Feels  So let's listen  Oh my god  I guess this is not allowed  On the Ronda Fez show  Do they play it?  They played  I've heard it once  I don't know  You know  It was just this week 
[02:47:30]  And then Fez said  You're going to have  A long internship  What a get up and go  Gumption kind of an intern  God bless the kid  Do we have him?  Oh that's right  We're not allowed  Here's the song  Let me take you now  Cause I'm going to  Blueberry fields  What the fuck's the big deal  I'm getting pretty hung about it  Blueberries can't stand alone 
[02:48:00]  Blueberry's not a stand alone fruit  It needs something to make it work  Just like the kiwi  It just needs something else  That's why kiwis fucking rock  Let me take you now 
[02:48:30]  Cause I'm going to  Blueberry fields  What the fuck's the big deal  I'm getting pretty hung about it  Blueberries can't stand alone  It's a long song  But I'll tell you right the fuck now  If we were allowed to have interns  I'd grab that guy tomorrow  Yeah yeah  That's good  That's a really good song parody  That's really good 
[02:49:00]  Yeah  Yeah  But Fezzy said he's going to have  A long internship now  Well to come in your first day  And do a song parody  Making light of  Why not make light of it  I think you gotta  You gotta make light of something  That was serious on the show  And you gotta take  What's going on on the show  And not take it personally  And just go like  Wow this kid's got some talent  Well Fez doesn't like the fact  That he's been embarrassed  He feels disrespected  And all of a sudden  This new kid just comes in  And is just mocking him  To get everybody on his side  No kid on the block 
[02:49:30]  Right  Yeah  He almost  He almost killed their intern  Fast Freddy a few months back  Oh yeah yeah  I mean he was a bit intoxicated  At the time  Yeah I remember that one  Wow  That's really good though  Bravo to that kid  Who has no name yet  That's a really good parody  That's his name  No name  No name  So that's his name  Right  So he has a name  It's called no name  There's a DJ name  No name though  He's in San Francisco  That doesn't matter  I know  He's an intern  Oh is he the guy  That used to work with the girl  Yeah with Sarah  Yeah he's great  Alright  We're gonna take a break 
[02:50:00]  And talk to Ice-T and Coco next  Stay there  Serious Serious XM  The Virus  The Opin' Anthony Show  Rather be a new jack hustler  Oh yeah  That means one thing  Ice-T is in the studio  I was ready to say  In the house  I'm in the house  I would have sounded  Really really old school  Yeah yeah  We're in the building  I'm reading in the prep sheet  I never knew this  You were in the break-in films  Yep  That's where I was  That was my first time 
[02:50:30]  Being in movies  What did you do in break-in  Or break-in 2  Oh okay  You had a small part  Like you know  When Shabadoo and Boogaloo  Shrimp and them  Were in the club  I was the guy on the stage  And I was rapping  It was kind of like  A featured background person  I didn't have lines  I just rapped  I think I did know that actually  Maybe I have heard that before  I haven't watched  The break-in movies in a while  I thought Beach Street  Was a little better  I mean you know  From my experience  In white suburban  North Brunswick  I have no idea  Which one was more realistic  But I preferred Beach Street 
[02:51:00]  And we want to say good morning  To Coco too  Of course  He's here with Ice-T  I'm here  Yes right early  I was just telling Ice-T  That usually we like to  See the show  Before you guys come in  And we didn't get  An advanced copy  And then you said  Quickly that it's a comedy  Well you know  We went to shoot the show  Eight years ago  They came at us  To shoot a show  Coco did this thing  Called Hip-Hop Wives  And they wanted to do one  And I was like nah  Reality show  To break up the marriage  And everything  I'm not with it  You know  Ten years  Eight years later 
[02:51:30]  They kept coming  E  They kept coming  And finally I said  Look  We'll do it under one circumstance  That you really shoot us  You get us  And you don't twist it  You know  Because my relationship  Is important to me  If we fight or whatever  We'll do it  But don't add anything  Fake drama  Yeah  No fake drama  Like assisted reality  Assisted  Or edited in a way  To make it worse  Than it really was  Right  That crap  After the first show  They said  You guys got a comedy  You know  And I'm like  I'm funny  And we started to look  At the scenes  And I'm like  Kind of funny 
[02:52:00]  You know  When you look at it  Yeah  So it came out  As a comedy  And we shot all eight shows  I've seen them  We're very happy with them  And I'm very critical  You know  I'm protecting myself  I'm not gonna lie  But I didn't touch  One frame of any show  I just said  Let it go  It looks good  Oh there's nothing  You wanted out  You were fine with all of it  I mean you know  I'm in control of what I do  I just  Like I say  I just don't need a twist  Or something put on there  You know  So they got the tone of it  And I'm very happy of it  So it's a reality show 
[02:52:30]  I'm proud of  But Coco will tell you  It's like we broke the trend  Well I believe we broke the trend  Because nowadays  Everything is a train wreck  You know  And it seems  This is really a housewife show  And you see  This is  If you lay across  Every network  Has like a housewife show  Including housewives of this  Housewives of that  Housewives  And it's like  They seem to be  Unhappy  Yeah  In a mansion  In a mansion  Right  And this is the one  Housewife show  Where I'm very happy 
[02:53:00]  Yeah  And I've proved  That we can be together  For ten years  And still be happy  And under the circumstances  That I work for ICE  You know  I'm his assistant  So I'm not just  The housewife  That stays at home  I'm the cute housewife  That is his assistant  She's like my Sharon Osbourne  She keeps me together  Holds it down  Yeah  You know  Who's the boss though  Because Sharon  Certainly runs that operation  Well I'm very organized  Anal person  You know  Don't say anal  On this show  All these guys 
[02:53:30]  Just got erections  You said that  That's your brain  I'm not going up  That's an open app  I know what goes on  He's reading the room  He's reading the room  Why do you make it so easy  For us  But I am  I'm very very  I'm very much  Of a perfectionist  And you know  He needs that  His life was so unorganized  When I came in  You know  And I just slightly  Organized him  And here he is  You know  He's still  I mean  I guess if you say  Who's the boss  At the end of the day 
[02:54:00]  I'll have the final say  But I don't  My job is not to override  Everything she's doing  Because I have her in charge  Trying to make things right  So we got to balance it out  You know  Some guys just don't want  Their woman to have any say  So I'm like  Well then there's only one person  Running the show  I mean  I appreciate  Having a partner  Because a lot of things  And as an artist  I can generate money  I'm just not into  Crossing the T's  And dotting the I's  You know  That's just not my thing  So I want to do the art  And I would watch  Just Osbournes 
[02:54:30]  And I'm like  Would Ozzy have a mansion  If it wasn't for sure  I mean  Does he even know  He's on TV  And I'm a big fan of Oz  You know  And when he does his thing  Can nobody touch him  But that's his thing  Now paying phone bills  I don't know if that's what Ozzy does  Yeah Ozzy's not a receipt saver  Right  Right  Exactly  We'll write this dinner off  I can't see him saying that  That's probably not Ozzy's thing either  You're right  But that's what she does  A lot of artists  But I hope you watch the money  Because a lot of artists  Especially with royalties  Musicians  Get fucked by the companies 
[02:55:00]  And by people  Because they don't watch the trail  It's hard for musicians  I've already done that  I've already lost the money  Because of that  Fortunately I've been in the game  25 years  So I've gone through that  That zone of wasting money  I had 15 cars  You know  Giving all your money  To your friends  I've been through that  Business managers and managers  Or whatever  That don't look out for you  The whole thing  But fortunately I've been able  To sustain  And you know  Now that I've gotten on  Law and Order  I've been on there 12 years 
[02:55:30]  I've got my books tight  And everything  So I survived the coming of age  Of a celebrity  Where you usually  If you don't make it past that point  You're through  You know what  He just described MC Hammer  Who we had in here  And he couldn't keep sustaining it  And that's the problem  With MC Hammer  So he gave all his money away  As he was going  But then all of a sudden  The money stopped coming in  And then he was in deep trouble  There's a guilt that goes along  With success  You know  When you're making it  And all your friends aren't 
[02:56:00]  And you want to help them  Bring some people up  Yeah  You know  You can't even come around  Your neighborhood in a new car  Because everybody's still broke  And you want to see  Your friends come  And you want to go on vacation  But you don't want new friends  So you bring your friends  It starts to cost a lot of money  You know  But after you've done it  For a long enough time  Now my boys is like  Ice already paid us  He did more than he had to do  He can come around  Let him live  Let him live  He doesn't owe anybody  Nothing  You know  So I've made it through  That growing period of fame 
[02:56:30]  And people that come from nothing  They understand that  You know  You got your family  And it's not that  They're asking for it  You feel guilty in a way  To say I won  Because of your success  You mean  Or like you have  What they don't have  And it's like  Yeah  Yeah  You start to feel like  I'm obligated to do something  And then there's something  That will  Sugar Ray Leonard  Was in the other day  And in his book  He's talking about the people  And how they just don't stop  Asking you for money  Family, friends  Well you just gotta say no  After a while  It's hard though right  It's hard  It's hard  But after a while  And then you say no 
[02:57:00]  You say I'm not doing it anymore  I'm that  You tell them  Look I gotta pay taxes  I got this  I got that  And they go  I can tell my friends  Look man  I owe a million dollars  And I gotta do this  And I gotta do that  And I'm having this  And they go  Okay  I get it  Yeah it's bad  But can I still borrow 5G  It's like no matter  What you say  They're like looking  At what they see  And they  You're on TV  You know  I mean how can  You not  Right right  By the way you missed  Let me tell everybody  What they missed  Ice-T said you're on TV  And three desperate faces 
[02:57:30]  Looked up  He was speaking kind of  Metaphorically  We've had a wild two days  Yeah it got a little crazy  Yeah  I wanted to ask you about  Going pretty much  From gangsta to mainstream  Over the years  You successfully pulled that off  Yeah  Were you catching any flack  When you first kind of  Started going mainstream  About like your street cred  And people going like 
[02:58:00]  You sell out  And shit like that  The only time I ever get it  Is from the square  You know  Like the cats from the hood  Know  They're happy to see me  Successful  Sure  You know what I'm saying  They know that  You know when you're in the streets  Doing that  You're doing that  Because those are the options  That are open to you  As new options open  If you don't take them  You're a sucker  You're coming from the ghetto  Complaining about not having  An opportunity  Then you get an opportunity  And you don't take it  Then you're a sucker  Now you got corny people  On the sideline  Oh he's lost his street cred 
[02:58:30]  You know  What the fuck do you know  About street cred  Any damn way  You know I mean  My street cred is bulletproof  I've done  Whatever has to be done  To get the street cred  That's why I just wrote  Put out my new book  Called  ISIS Road  From South Central  To Hollywood  And it shows  The transition  But  You know  Those who say don't know  And those who know don't say  I'm far from a cop  Trust me  Just trust me  You know  I'm a good actor  I love that explanation  You put out by the way 
[02:59:00]  The book right  Pimp  You put out  Didn't you  I wrote the forward  To Pimp by Iceberg Slim  Right  Like you kind of  Re-released it or whatever  Yeah you know  Because I admired Iceberg  And that's where I got my name  But then at some point  In reading the books  Of course at first  I wanted to live his life  Then I realized  He's a writer  At some point it hit me  Like he's a writer  So if I really want to be  Held forever  In people's hearts  And in their minds  I need to document  The game  It's not about being  The biggest hustler 
[02:59:30]  On the street  It's the one  Who wrote about it  That's who gets  To you know  Last forever  It's an amazing book  I've read it twice  I've read it too  Love it  When was he alive  Like the 40s  He was  And we just did a movie  On his life too  Oh  We did a documentary  On It's Not Done  But you know  That's what my music  Was meant to be  Like documentation  Of the game  Are there photos of him  And who  And who was the guy  The other one  Who had the cat  Miss Peaches  Who was that  The tall  The tall  Bald  Pimp  Who I think  He got everything  From  That's the guy 
[03:00:00]  I want to see  A photo of  Oh my god  Damn  It's probably  Been a while  Right  But yeah  Yeah  I'm trying  I'm supposed to  Know that name  I don't know  Either  Yeah  Well see  Probably his name  Was Mac  That's a good name  For a pimp  Mac  You know  But you know  That's what it is  So if you read my book  My book is kind of like  In the same sense  It shows the growth  And it shows all the  Different channels  I went through  In music  And yeah  Then how do you  End up on Law and Order  Right  How did that happen  But you know 
[03:00:30]  That was a great run  Hey I'm still on it  You know  I just re-signed  For another couple years  Nice  You know  I'm able to do that  Then I'm over here  Doing my rock band  Playing Cop Killer  Over on this side of town  And you know  It's just  Those people  That really know me  When they watch our TV show  They'll laugh  They'll go  Yo that's ice right there  Because I'm comfortable  With who I am  Some of the music  You did years ago  Does it kind of seem  Silly now  All the fuss  That was made of it  When you look at  What's going on 
[03:01:00]  In music today  And on the internet  And what not  Yeah well you know  Come on  I mean everything  Seems silly  In retrospect  It's like  It's like the news  Is real stupid  Period  You know  It's like every time  Oh you know  Breast implants  Will explode on a plane  Oh you know  Every time  Something  Every time  I'm like  What happened  Did pitbull  Stop biting people  That was like  Happening for a while  That was the big story  Yeah like the big stories  Just rotate  So I was just  One of the big stories  Right right  It's all stupid  I mean considering 
[03:01:30]  What's really going on  Yeah you know what  At the time  It was such a big story  And everybody was  Totally hating you  And it almost seems  Nostalgic  And kind of  Funny now  That there was  Such a fuss  Made of  You know music  The president  Was after me  But now I have something  How many people  Can actually say  That the president  Of the United States  Of America  Spoke their name  In anger  You and Kanye West  Yeah  You really are  Even when Kanye  Came out and said  The president doesn't 
[03:02:00]  Like black people  I'm like  Have you listened  To Public Enemy  It's like  This is not  A new comment  You know  Right right right  This is new  But Kanye  You know  He said something  At the time  And you know  When you look down there  And you look at  At New Orleans  Where he was  And he saw those people  Sitting out in the street  And the floods  That's how it seemed  It didn't really look  Like anybody cared  I don't see  I don't think  Beverly Hills  Would have been  Floating around that long  Yeah he  He spoke his mind  And then  God damn 
[03:02:30]  Michael Myers  Mike Myers  Was next to him  At the time  And his face  Just  He looked  And like  Why am I  Don't give me a shot  Dragged into this  He just wanted to  Read a few lines  And get off this thing  I've never seen  Such a pretend  That didn't just happen  Face  He just stared  Straight ahead  Hoping everything  Would go away  And he'd wake up  And he wouldn't be there  You see any  Of the other  PE guys  Oh definitely  I just did a movie  I just finished  Directing a movie  Called The Art of Rap  Where I interviewed  A lot of emcees 
[03:03:00]  From back in the days  Public Chuck D  Of course  Yeah  And it's more of  A movie about  How  How you rap  Not the money  The girls  The cars  It's like  The art form  Right  So we're gonna  Have that out  Later this summer  What do you think  Changed about  Because you listen  To rap from  Run DMC  And the way they were  And the way it is now  Lyrically it's a lot  Different  It went pop  You think it got more pop  No it's pop  It's pop music now  Now what you're doing  Is you're listening to  What you're hearing 
[03:03:30]  On the radio  Is pop music  With a rap delivery  See you can rap  Anybody can rap  But that's not hip hop  Hip hop has a special  Sound to it  It has a special  Vibe to it  But when you  You know you're doing  A pop record  And then you  Then you just  Happen to rap  That doesn't  You know  Pink can rap  You know  There's a lot of people  That can rap  So it's  It's lost its soul  If you ask me  But I say that  Meaning I want to  Inspire the soul  To come back  I'm not saying it  Like a hater  I just want the kids 
[03:04:00]  To bring the soul back  I'd love to see  An 18 year old  Public enemy group  Come out right now  Young kids  Or a new KRS1  Because no matter  What we do  We're old now  We're older than them  We're the parents age  So the kids don't want  So they need somebody  From their generation  To come out  And rock the world again  What happened to KRS1  I just like  I  He's still out there  But you know  Once  Now since we live  In a pop culture  If you're not on the radio  Then people don't think  You exist  You know  You have to be  On the radio  The little girls 
[03:04:30]  Right now  They like  If it's not on MTV  Then it must not be good  And then MTV  Doesn't even play music anymore  No  One last thing  I was  I was talking to a 21 year old girl  The other day  Doing me  Doing an interview  She said  Ice  About music  And I said  Well I made my money in music  When people went to the record store  Yeah  She said  What's a record store  Wow  I swear to god  Yep  And I said  Like Tower  Oh no  Like  Where how  Oh  Virgin  Oh  Fy  She said  Like Best Buy  Oh shit  And I said 
[03:05:00]  Well they're trying to sell microwaves  Really  And Best Buy  And Best Buy  Is even pushing  Kind of the music out  You go  To Best Buy  And try to find something  They don't care  Nothing's in an alphabetical order anymore  It's just kind of  Just thrown around  It's all electronic delivery  You ever think  You'd see the day  That there would be  No bookstores  And no record stores  In our lifetime  Are you crazy  Dude  I got people  You know  Cause I'm from the music business  Every day  An artist walks up to me  I want to get put on ice  Can you help me  And I ask them  I say  Well what's the last record you bought  And they give me this blank face 
[03:05:30]  I'm like  So this is the industry  You're trying to get into  Yeah  Now you ask why I'm on television  Right  You know  God damn yeah  You can't  I went to get the Aussie box set  Of course you did  I know  Of course you did  Every discussion goes back to Aussie  But I tried to  I went to Best Buy  They didn't have it  It's like you had to order  Or go to a specialty store in Jersey  They just  You can't get  Any type of specialty stuff  Like that  Unless it's the Beatles  Or somebody that's gonna sell everywhere  It's crazy  Wiener's on TV  What the hell was that guy  Oh yeah  Well  I think he's just trying to live up to his name 
[03:06:00]  Right  Yeah  The wiener thing  That was not that impressive a dick  I'm sorry  It just wasn't  No  All smoke and mirrors  No it was the fact that  You know  He was  You know  He's a politician  He was lying  Oh so when  What does that do  A politician lying  And showing porn  Exactly  Pictures of himself  They're all doing it  It's like  Everybody is  Doing that shit  It's just  You know  You don't want to see it  When you say politician  Immediately  I think creepy  Thank you  Yeah yeah  I'm with iced tea 
[03:06:30]  I think lying sack of shit  And yeah  Creepy  Doesn't matter  I think helpful  And it doesn't matter what side  So I  Yeah absolutely  Crossed the board for me  Hey  Coco's just sitting there  Looking all beautiful  Looking all beautiful  And we got a reality show  I know  She loves sitting around the men  When we chop it up  You know  I do  Yeah that's how a woman learns  Like let the men talk  Release a secret  Oh there we go  Ice will  He could sit here all day

[03:13:00]  To sit down  Well that's the thing  Okay I might be a hypocrite  When I say this  But yes  I got my boobs enhanced  At 18 years old  I'm against  The button clamps  And people go  Oh you did that  Why would you be against that  But seriously  Think about it  I'm not sitting on my chest  Yeah  It's like your butt  Is the main key  On your body  You're constantly  Doing something  With your legs  And I've seen a lot  Go wrong  I've seen one droop down  Yeah it doesn't seem  Like it could be  As natural looking  But they got 
[03:13:30]  The implants in there  They got the shots  Or whatever  It's just  It's nasty  They're creepy looking  They really  They don't look  There's something  Off about them  I mean what I say  You don't bang  What I say  I mean you don't  I don't  You know  Bang  Your boobs  I bang  Your ass  You know what I'm saying  Now it's good  To have some  Meat back there  Because I don't want  To break a pelvis  Or anything  When I'm in motion  Some padding  Right  That's what it tells me  Ice tea is an animal  I'm a man  Oh yeah  Are we going to it  Tare that shit up  Yeah  Well we have this thing 
[03:14:00]  We have this thing  That people have been asking us  How we keep our relationship together  And we have this thing  That we call  The sexual code  Okay  And I think  Every man  Every woman  Has a sexual code  Now the code  Is whatever it takes  To turn you  The fuck on  Okay  It might mean  You might need to see  A girl in a wetsuit  And figure skates  I don't know  What the code is  The question is  Are you willing  To tell the code  And are they  Tell the code  And are they willing  To accommodate  The code  And we all have a code 
[03:14:30]  You know  And the thing of it  Is usually  When you're just dating  You're afraid  To tell the code  Because it might be  A little too kinky  Right right  But once you understand  The code  It's going to be good  And it could be  A bunch of codes  It could be a bunch of codes  Yeah  It could be a bunch of codes  It could be  It could be  A long list of codes  Could you give us  One of your codes  Yes Jimmy  I like when I'm having  Sex with a girl  And she talks about  How she's fucked guys  Who are better fucks  Than I am  And have bigger dicks  Than I do  And that turns you  To fuck off  Well it's just  Such an easy 
[03:15:00]  It's such an easy  Thing to find  But yeah  I like the humiliation  Of it  Because I'm so jaded  After all these years  Of porn  It's like  I'm so numb  I like two girls  But it's like  I would rather hear  About her telling me  How she would rather  Be fucking somebody  Other than me  Because that's taboo  And that just makes you  Explode  That  The three way orgasm  Where you fart  And you come  And you get a headache  If she says it right  It becomes the four way  Because I shit as well 
[03:15:30]  The four way  I talked about  The three way  One time on Twitter  And people were like  Are you what  A headache  And some people  It's like  Man I know  What that one is  Well you really  Think you're gonna die  When you're extremely  You're like  I love you  Another code  Some gasket's  Gonna blow  Somewhere  Toes are about  Things pop off  Like rockets  Today is code Friday  I like  If body scent is good  I like no deodorant  I like a little smell  Into the arms  That can be very sexy 
[03:16:00]  See look  I think you might have  Hit one of the coco's toes  I don't need deodorant  As long as the chemistry's good  If the body chemistry  The chemistry yeah  That's nature telling you  That you should be  Or you shouldn't be  I gave up one of my codes  I go into stalker mode  Right before we get home  So like  Right before we get ready  To come in  We've been out all night  Then I'll say  Walk in front of me  She walks  I let her open the door  He wants to be  Like he doesn't know me  I want to be behind her  And follow her into the house  And kind of like  You know  Cause I want  Cause you gotta think  When you're with your girl all night 
[03:16:30]  You don't really get to see her  Cause she's right with you  Everyone else  Gets to admire her  So I'm like  Just walk ahead  And you walk into the door  And then I come through the door  And I'm evil Mick  You know  Yeah  I'm that guy  Yeah  You get to be creepy guy  At the party  I get to be creepy guy  At the party  To follow their home  Exactly  And that's  It works for me  That's just one of the  Many codes of the ice  Yeah there are many codes  And they can be physical too  But for me  They're more mental  Cause you can't create  It's usually mental 
[03:17:00]  You're more mental  But then also  With your girl  They have to find out the code  And they have to work on it  And work on it  To become the best at it  So you don't look anywhere else  By the way  When is your show on?
