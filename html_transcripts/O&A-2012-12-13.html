<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily focusing on their reactions to the 12-12-12 Hurricane Sandy benefit concert and a subsequent concert they attended.  The show began with a scathing critique of the 12-12-12 concert, specifically targeting Kanye West’s lengthy and inappropriate performance, the disastrous “Drunk Uncle” SNL skit, and Bruce Springsteen’s apparent wardrobe malfunction, which resulted in graphic commentary from the hosts about his exposed genitals.  Jon Bon Jovi’s performance of "Born to Run" was deemed underwhelming,  Adam Sandler’s Hurricane Sandy parody was deemed awkward and unfunny, and Billy Crystal’s performance was criticized for arrogance.  In contrast, Eddie Vedder and Roger Waters' collaboration received praise.  The hosts also discussed the "E-Rock" Twitter account that leaked the concert's setlist and the subsequent controversy surrounding the selective deletion of tweets. Sam joined the conversation towards the end of this segment.  The hosts played snippets of music from various artists featured in the concert. A planned appearance by Quentin Tarantino was mentioned.

Further discussion of the 12-12-12 concert continued, focusing on various performers' appearances and performances, including Roger Daltrey (whose chest and possibly wig were discussed at length), Eddie Vedder, Eric Clapton, Billy Joel, Mick Jagger, and Kanye West, whose brief performances were compared unfavorably to others.  Humorous observations about the performers' ages and appearances were prevalent. The "Drunk Uncle" skit was again heavily criticized.

The show then shifted to the hosts' experience at another concert. This segment included detailed critiques of Coldplay's performance (specifically "Losing My Religion" and "Viva La Vida"), Paul McCartney (including a surprise Nirvana collaboration on "Cut Me Some Slack"), and Alicia Keys ("Empire State of Mind"). Michael Stipe's unexpected appearance was noted.  The hosts discussed vocal quality, audience reception, and their own ambivalent feelings toward Coldplay's popularity.  A behind-the-scenes anecdote about an agent's tardiness and perceived lack of importance was shared, along with discussion about the challenges of managing long-term collaborations, using The Who's onstage tension as an example.  The unexpected Paul McCartney/Nirvana collaboration was discussed at length, including speculation on the involvement of Dave Grohl and Chris Novoselic. The physical appearance and gait of an unnamed individual was mocked.  The segment also included criticism of Ben Stiller's phone interview and Travis Meeks's past performance.

Quentin Tarantino then joined the show.  A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a discussion of *Django Unchained*, including casting choices (particularly John Travolta and Don Johnson), the film's structure, graphic scenes, and the performances of Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis.  Tarantino discussed actors initially considered for roles (Kurt Russell, Sacha Baron Cohen), his writing process (including his preference for longhand), his collaboration with Harvey Weinstein, and the challenges of blending comedy and drama. He discussed his film viewing habits and described scenes in graphic detail. The interview ended with further discussion of *Django Unchained*'s themes and reception and a mention of his upcoming show with Artie Lange, Amy Schumer, and David Tell.  The interview, like much of the show, included frequent use of vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Hi. Me and Anthony had a fight. Danny's fired. Good morning, everybody.  You guys didn't even talk about that. What's wrong with you?  Well, you weren't here.  Nah, we just kind of let it ride.  Good morning, everybody. That was no moment. 
[00:00:30]  Ah.  Anyway.  Yeah.  That fucking concert last night was terrific.  I'm sleepy now because of it. I stayed up for the whole thing.  It was like 1.15, 1.20 when it all ended.  Right.  Oh, my God.  I made it to 11.30, 11.40. For me, that's...  That's way past bedtime.  What else are you going to do, man?  Fuck, it's been a long three days.  What else are you going to do? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, I made it to 11.30, 11.45.  It was Billy Joel that... No, actually, it was Kanye West that fucking made me go, you know what?  I started looking at the clock going, yeah, maybe I should go to bed.  And they fucking blew it with Kanye West.  It went way too long.  Way too long.  Yeah, but the energy and the rhythm was there.  Everything was good.  The pacing of the concert.  And then they put Kanye West on the stage.  And everyone's like, fuck!  Yeah.  And that was the beginning of the end for me.  And then who was on after Kanye? 
[00:01:30]  Billy Joel.  Billy Joel came on.  Okay, there you go.  So then I made it through one or two Billy Joel songs and I was done.  Well, musically, Billy Joel was on.  But the genius that was SNL's Drunk Uncle bit came on right after Kanye.  And wow.  SNL should be embarrassed.  I was telling Anthony before the show, I'm like, if one of our guys came to us and said,  hey, man, we got this bit, it's called Drunk Uncle, the person would be fired.  It's like, what?  And we're just a dopey radio show.  That was in front of two billion people last night. 
[00:02:00]  Every so often you had to remember.  You had to remember every so often.  It's like, oh, yeah, this is going out to the world.  Every channel is showing it.  Yeah.  And it just makes me feel like, you know what?  I could be on SNL.  Could do that.  You know what?  The person listening to our voices right now, you could be on SNL.  They should have used one of Jimmy's bits.  They put that last night.  Maybe they should have used one of Jimmy's bits.  Yeah, that would be the time for it.  I don't watch SNL anymore, so what?  Is that one of their benchmark characters?  I don't either.  Terrible.  I mean, everyone was like, holy fuck, Kanye West is out of place, 
[00:02:30]  and his sound didn't sound right, whatever.  And then he was led off the hook by Drunk Uncle.  Drunk Uncle.  We had Kanye.  We had him.  And he fucked it up.  And then he throws his mic down dramatically like he had a great set.  No, you didn't.  Everyone went and got T-shirts.  People were bored watching him.  Of course they were.  Maybe he's better than that.  I have no idea.  I've never seen a Kanye West performance.  But that was just sounding like shit. 
[00:03:00]  He doesn't cross over.  He crosses over to white people, but not.  That's a Billy Joel, McCartney, Pink Floyd audience.  He should have done two songs.  He should have done Diamonds of Forever, One More Thing, and it would have been very nice.  But they just gave him too much time because it was probably his record sales.  It had to be 20 minutes.  It had to be 20 minutes.  And then he's wearing a skirt.  What was that about?  Well, you know, these guys are trying to always shock and come up with something different.  You think that's going to catch on?  A leather skirt.  That leather fucking pleated skirt.  You just look like an idiot.  Terrible. 
[00:03:30]  Terrible.  Fuck.  That was awful.  I missed most of it.  I wished I would have seen some.  I came in on Clapton.  I missed so much of it.  I'm going to laugh all day because, and Ant was laughing at this one too, but Bruce Springsteen  has the biggest fucking cock.  Bruce's cock and balls were the star of the show.  Most of the time there's a guitar in front.  Yeah.  So you don't see the deliciousness that is Bruce Springsteen's cock.  Like, I started choking on food. 
[00:04:00]  I was laughing so hard.  And then this is the relationship I got.  I call my wife and I'm like, you have to see this.  And then we're just, we're both just pointing at the TV and then we're like touching it.  We're just like touching, touching because it was so fucking funny.  He had a semi.  He really did.  In front of two billion people.  He was plumped up.  Who does that?  Who walks on a stage in front of two billion people with his cock showing basically?  With a half a rod and a giant ball bag swiped over to the right side of his pants. 
[00:04:30]  Do you think he takes Viagra for something like on stage for the energy or the blood flow?  Well, I think if you're going to, I saw Bruce Springsteen recently and he likes wearing  the tight pants.  He loves those tight working class jeans.  I assume he wants a good presentation, you know, the old days, the rock stars would fucking  stuff their shit.  Yeah.  But that, you could see the whole outline and everything.  Wow.  You could see his helmet. 
[00:05:00]  Yes.  His fucking helmet, shaft and giant balls.  Right.  We're right there for billions to see.  And there's just so many people that just really need to get off Twitter because they  don't understand the spirit of Twitter whatsoever.  And people are like, you know, I find it deeply disturbing that you're pointing out Bruce  Springsteen's dick.  Why?  Like way to not get anything.  Way to not get comedy.  Why?  Why would they like call you out on that?  You have to point that out. 
[00:05:30]  He's got a half a rod in front of billions of people.  They're starting a huge benefit concert and you're staring at his dick.  Do you have that anywhere?  Oh, God.  If you could find it for Jimmy, man.  There's a...  I read that on Twitter.  I didn't understand it because I didn't see his set.  It was astounding.  It might have been a little later in his set because I think he got rid of his guitar.  So he was just standing there basically naked to the world.  He couldn't hide it.  It's a little tough right now to find video because... 
[00:06:00]  Now I understand.  How about still images?  Any still images?  People weren't taking pictures.  It was the talk of Twitter until, you know, the next stupid thing happened.  The next debacle.  Right.  And then people were like, you know, why do you have to hate on everything?  First of all, I wasn't hating on everything.  I was making jokes like anyone else.  Right.  Because this is something that was fun to fucking do.  You don't think I really enjoyed Eddie Vedder and Roger Waters doing Comfortably Numb?  Of course.  But what do you do?  You tweet that?  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:06:30]  You come up...  You write about his tennis elbows.  That's what you do.  Of course I enjoyed all the acts.  Yeah, it was cool.  They all sounded great.  But fucking...  You got my fucking Springsteen's dick.  To start the show off with his big fucking cock.  Big hog.  And then, you know, the Jersey guys, they brought out Jon Bon Jovi to sing with him.  What song did they sing together when it was Bruce's band?  Yeah, yeah.  They sang... 
[00:07:00]  Oh, Born to Run.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking...  Oh, my God.  Did Bon Jovi...  Bon Jovi was left behind on that song.  Yeah.  You noticed that, right?  Yeah, he wasn't really familiar with it, it seemed.  Something.  It was weird.  He couldn't fucking, you know, sing it right or something.  It was all right.  It was passable, but it's Born to Run, man.  Yeah, yeah.  He started off weird, like he was in the wrong key.  Was that it?  Yeah.  Yeah, and then that side mic they didn't have figured out.  It seemed like it was a little lower and not processed or something.  And then when Bon Jovi came on with Bon Jovi, a lot of people commenting on his turtleneck. 
[00:07:30]  A lot of people saying, why is Jon wearing that turtleneck?  Why is he looking like Steve Jobs?  Yeah.  Is he about to do a PowerPoint presentation?  Yeah.  And they were also wondering about his inflection and his voice.  Something about it sounded like he was pulling a Spock, trying to hold his dentures in, sing  over his dentures.  I don't know if Jon Bon Jovi has dentures.  I wouldn't think so, but it sounded weird. 
[00:08:00]  He's got to update his look or something, though.  Yeah.  Everyone else has pretty much updated their look.  And he's just going with that 80s hair still.  Yeah.  He's going to do it right to the end, I guess, huh?  For a while, a few years back, didn't he have much shorter hair when he was going for  that acting career?  A while?  I guess.  But it's like that weird mullet-y thing.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I mean, I'm sure the broads still love him.  Yeah.  They sounded all right.  Drunk Uncle comes on during Weekend Update. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Why would you do that?  Oh, it was awful.  Lorne Michaels should be embarrassed.  And Seth is hilarious.  I wanted to hear Seth talk.  I didn't want to see that nonsense.  Yeah, Seth knows how to get the job done.  And, man, after Kanye, Seth came out and got applause like Kanye wished he would have  gotten.  Yeah.  Right.  And then they go into Drunk Uncle.  Oh, my God.  It was horrendous.  I mean, what was it?  I mean, Lorne Michaels, that had to be his decision.  They probably said, look, you got a spot here.  What do you want to do with it?  Yeah.  Oh, let's fucking put Drunk Uncle on stage. 
[00:09:00]  Drunk Uncle.  Are you kidding me?  Did you enjoy Brian Williams riffing backstage with the Sopranos?  That's...  Oh.  At first, I liked that smirky shit that he did, but now it's like he's overdoing it  or something.  Yeah.  He's like, look, I'm the cool anchor.  Right.  I'm the cool anchor that knows to have a little fun.  I have a little fun.  Right.  Nah, he stinks.  He really stinks.  He confused Pete Townsend for Keith Moon.  You sure?  Yeah.  Because Keith Moon sang a song.  Everyone knows that, right? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  But he...  From the grave, obviously.  That weird...  Right, right.  You know, Pete Townsend's like, I'm not looking at the fucking dead guy.  No, no.  This was your idea of Roger Daltrey.  Yeah, Roger kept turning around and looking and like...  He was into it.  And into it.  And Townsend's like, I'm just gonna fucking look at my guitar.  That guy's been dead for 40 years.  What are we doing?  Really?  It wasn't really relevant.  It's a weird Who song.  I don't know that one, I don't think.  No, that was one of those weird kind of old school Who songs. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, but he said something like...  Because Townsend cursed.  He said, get a fucking beer.  Right.  And then he said, yeah, Uncle Pete or Uncle Keith.  Uncle Keith taught him some new words, taught the kids some new words.  Right.  Because he had cursed.  I think he meant, you know, he was trying to talk about Pete Townsend.  Very odd, though.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, we should go down the list.  So then Eddie Vedder came out with Roger Waters.  I mean, it's Pig Floyd, obviously. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what they called it.  Did they call it Pink Floyd?  They just said Roger Waters.  It's just Roger Waters, yeah.  Which is fine.  Most people understand.  Yeah.  And I know Ant's not a fan, but fucking Eddie Vedder.  No, he is.  He tweeted that Eddie Vedder's Chrysler.  Chrysler.  I meant his looks.  But he did a great job.  Eddie Vedder killed Comfortably Numb.  I mean that in a good way.  Holy fuck was that good.  I like Eddie Vedder's covers.  He did a cover of a Ramones song I loved.  It's one of my favorite things.  He can sing.  He should do cover songs.  Oh, Bellboy, of course, from Quadrophenia.  Thanks, Kevin, from Connecticut. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, that was the Keith Moon song.  Oh, right.  I'm trying to remember that damn thing.  It's not one of those songs that got a lot of radio airplay.  No.  I don't know it that well.  No.  But Vedder was great.  Fucking Roger Waters.  The band sounded great.  Yeah.  It's weird.  Roger Waters could hold it together for, I know, 30 seconds with his voice.  I know.  And then he needs the other guy or he needs Eddie Vedder.  But when he's doing it for 30 seconds, it's exactly like the record.  Right.  And then it kind of gets a little shaky.  But then he like bails or something like, I can only do this here and there. 
[00:11:30]  He bails and walks up to the edge of the stage and smiles at the people.  It's official.  All these bands that we grew up with, they are fucking old as dirt.  Really old.  And we sort of said they were old 10 years ago, but no, now they're just fucking old.  Yeah.  Isn't it amazing so many of them are still alive, though?  Like, so many of them are still able to perform well.  And you know, they did their boozing and their drugging and all that shit.  All of them.  They've lost a few here and there.  But in general, you're right.  You're right.  I'm surprised a lot of them still have so much hair left. 
[00:12:00]  It's like, you look at some of these.  Look at the stones.  Like, I don't think they have wigs or transplant.  Like, Mick's hair, I think, is Mick's hair.  Well, we saw Keith Richards up close at the, which show was that?  The Paul McCartney show.  And it's a wreck.  Yeah, Keith's hair is a wreck.  But he can figure it out in a way where it looks like he has more than he does.  Yeah.  Ron Wood has...  You think that's a wig?  Ron Wood, yeah.  Oh, really?  I think so.  It's weird because you didn't see that transitional phase from going bald, bald, bald to wig with 
[00:12:30]  Ron Wood.  No.  Like, it seemed like he always had hair.  No.  It never seemed like Ron Wood was going bald.  Oh, maybe not.  So I think it's his real hair, dude.  Rod, know who had a major drop-off was Mick Jagger.  He looks horrendous.  Yeah.  He looks worse than Keith Richards, who looked horrible forever.  Keith Richards, I literally started cracking up to myself watching it.  He looked like Yoda last night.  He looked like fuck, and not even like, oh, it looks like Yoda. 
[00:13:00]  He really looked like Yoda.  He put his head down, and his mouth had a Yoda look to it.  His ears were sticking out because of his headband.  Right.  And his face had every line that Yoda had in it.  I went to a Rolling Stones press conference.  I think we were just back on satellite, so this is probably eight years ago now.  And he came out with like a fucking shirt with no sleeves, and he had like an alien's body.  Remember her alien autopsy?  He looked like that.  Yeah.  He had like a big like fucking beer belly, like not a hint of a muscle on his arms, and 
[00:13:30]  he had a fucking sleeveless shirt on.  Yeah, it was at Lincoln Center.  They did like three tunes.  We were standing like 30 feet from them.  50 feet.  You were there?  Yeah.  I swear to God.  Yeah.  You were there?  Oh, absolutely.  We went over together.  I feel like an idiot.  That's fine.  I didn't remember who I went with.  They came, and-  Remember they built that weird giant stage that was way, like had to be 20, 30 feet in  the air?  Matt Lauer was there.  I remember we were looking at him and some guy from the Daily News.  I forget who it was. 
[00:14:00]  Not Hinkley.  No, no, not.  It might have been Hinkley, actually.  Hinkley's the Daily News writer.  Yeah, you pointed him out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they did like brown show.  They did like three or four songs just to announce the tour.  You were there?  Yeah.  I feel like an idiot.  Oh, it's all right.  I mean, they were the event.  I mean, somebody else went with us.  I don't even remember who it was.  Yeah.  Oh.  There's like four of us.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they looked old in that.  Oh.  But Mick Jagger looks-  I noticed-  I know he walks with like that weird Mick Jagger gait across the stage, but he looked 
[00:14:30]  like he was like limping on one leg.  It looked like he was genuinely kind of hurt.  Maybe fucked up his hip or something.  Maybe.  Why do they only do two songs?  That's all they would agree to?  Probably.  So they did Doom and Gloom and Jumping Jack Flash and they were done.  That was it.  And they were done.  And then Kanye gets to do fucking, you know.  Right.  And every time someone was babbling about some shit, you're like, that could have been  another Stone song.  Oh, I know.  I know we're going to- I know we have to like pour the tears out for everybody, but fuck.  What if that was the Stone's decision? 
[00:15:00]  This will never happen again.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Because they're on tour now.  His hair looks ridiculous.  They were very late at that.  That might be a wig, dude.  You think?  Mick Jagger might have a wig.  That looks horrendous, too.  There was never a point where Mick looked like he was thinning, though.  You know, it's kind of weird.  I said he looked like your aunt trying to be cool at a wedding.  He just fucked it.  I don't know about him or Ron Wood.  Keith Richards is Keith Richards.  Charlie is Charlie's hair, definitely. 
[00:15:30]  No, Ron Wood, yeah.  Oh, that can't be his hair.  That's a lot of hair on Ron Wood.  That's a hair hat.  Maybe he's got some clip-on weave or something.  Yeah, maybe a weave, right?  Yeah.  I was never a Stone's fan, but they sounded great.  Yeah.  You liked them last night, yeah?  Yeah, I mean.  The guy's 70 years old, and he still sounds amazing.  Everything has to be prefaced with these guys with, he's, and then insert the age here,  and he sounded amazing.  Like, when I saw McCartney, like, last year, he did two and a half hours without taking 
[00:16:00]  a drink of water, and it's unbelievable.  Yeah.  Did he really?  Yes.  You start thinking about, like, your parents or grandparents and being, like, in their  70s and how they act, and then you see Mick fucking, like, dart across the stage  and you go, he's the same fucking age.  Right.  You see Paul McCartney screaming through Helter Skelter.  Right.  Every concert, and it's like, how do you do that?  Yeah, like, I can't picture Sal doing that.  Oh.  Hey!  Helter Skelter!  Da-na-na-na-na.  Next. 
[00:16:30]  So then, anything else on Roger Waters?  Why wasn't...  What's Dave...  David Gilmore?  David Gilmore.  Who I love.  Why wasn't he there?  They fucking hate each other.  They do, right?  Yeah, they were, you know...  They came back a few years ago in London for some giant help aid or some shit.  They were amazing.  Dude, they were amazing.  It's one of the best things I've ever seen is them singing live together in Wembley Stadium  or wherever it was.  Wembley.  Yeah, there was one empty seat there.  So it was like two Pink Floyds, basically, you know, traveling around.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  I like the Roger Waters version myself.  I want to hear the Eddie Vedder song.  Wasn't it a little uncomfortable when Eddie Vedder got kissed on the head by Roger Waters  when he put his arm around him and kissed him?  Like, was I jealous or...  Oh, were you jealous?  Is that what you're asking?  No.  I said Eddie looked a little uncomfortable.  I'm sure he did.  With the fact that he was being kissed by some old codger.  He's Eddie Vedder.  He's Christ-like.  Eddie's short, isn't he?  Yeah, he's really short.  That's weird because he always...  You know, he's got that bigger-than-life thing going on, I guess.  He makes up for it in his astounding vocal capabilities. 
[00:17:30]  Ah.  I can't argue with Travis.  He's amazing.  I love Eddie Vedder.  I'm not going to argue with him.  I fucking love Eddie Vedder.  I goof a lot.  I don't like when he starts babbling, but I don't like when most of these guys start  babbling in between songs.  Did you think of Jay Moore's impression, though, the second he hit the stage?  Of course.  That's all I fucking think about now when I see him.  I was listening to her live record yesterday, and he starts talking, and then when he intros  a song, it's all I can think of is Jay Moore.  Jay just ruined it for you.  It's hysterical, though. 
[00:18:00]  It's funny, man.  Should we play Comfortably Numb now or in a break?  Ooh.  Sam's going to have a disc of just some highlights for us.  He gave it to me, didn't he?  Oh, he did already?  Oh, he did.  I'm sorry.  Oh, it starts with the...  Okay, good.  Next on the list that we want to talk about, Adam Sandler.  Oh.  I missed that one.  Oh.  I didn't see it.  It's a doozy.  Poor guy.  You missed it?  It's a doozy.  Boy, talk about...  He takes himself very seriously. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He thinks it's God's gift to fucking songwriting and comedy.  It's one of those typical...  I swear to God, he should have sang the Hanukkah song.  He would have been better off.  And it's a perfect time for it.  Yeah, it's Hanukkah.  I thought he was gonna, yeah.  And then just fucking update it again.  Throw some new Jews in there.  Throw some new Jews in there.  I don't feel dandy because of hurricane...  You know, we know exactly that.  That's pretty much it.  You're not far off.  Dude, that's...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, no. 
[00:19:00]  You're pretty...  You pretty much hit it right there.  And he picks a Leonard Cohen song, which...  God, if Leonard Cohen came out to MSG and sang this, that's all you needed.  You didn't need fucking Adam Sandler trying to do a parody of him.  Hallelujah.  It's hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Which would have been amazing.  But instead, you get this.  You want to play some of it?  Oh, please.  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.  My name is Adam Sandler. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, I gotta laugh.  This is gonna be funny.  This is gonna be funny.  Oh, I can't even say my name without laughing.  We get it.  You're nervous and uncomfortable in your own skin.  God.  Enough.  Look out here, guys.  Oh, are you fine, people?  I don't even give a fuck.  I can't do his voice.  My name is Adam Sandler.  Oh, I'm laughing already.  It's all just fun.  That's my friend, Mr. Paul Schaefer. 
[00:20:00]  That's okay.  I'll do it without the guitar.  I'm cool.  We're honored to be here tonight raising money for the capital of the world, my hometown.  Okay, here we go.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  I'm cool.  The terror of the hurricane. 
[00:20:30]  The unforgiving wind and rain.  You know, I'm sorry to stop this, but it almost would have been cool if he just sang the song.  Right, right.  Because that would have been different.  Like, wait, he's known for a quote, funny songs and shit.  Oh, my gosh, I am.  I'm putting that in fucking quotes.  But if he just sang it straight, like, oh, fuck, that was kind of cool.  A little different.  Yeah.  Those are not the lyrics, obviously, right?  It's the beginning of the lyrics, isn't it?  Those are his lyrics.  Oh, he added?  I don't know the song.  I'm not familiar with the song.  I'm not either.  How does the original song go? 
[00:21:00]  You know, I thought that's how the original started, and then he kind of moved on to his shit.  It could have been.  I don't know.  Yeah, okay.  In the wind and rain, New York, the world held its breath as the storm took it to you.  Oh, boy.  But you've been knocked down in the past, taking shots they thought would last.  But you always get right up, shouting, hallelujah. 
[00:21:30]  Hallelujah.  Sandy, screw you.  We'll get through you.  Because we're New Yorkers.  Yeah, New York, you've dealt with crap before.  Like squeegee men and tunnel whores.  And restaurant delivery biking right through you. 
[00:22:00]  Don't puke on your stoops every Sunday morn.  Times Square losing all its porn.  Original Ray's Pizza closing to you.  To you.  Jimmy kind of likes it.  I don't hate it.  I don't hate it either.  It's just that when you hear Adam Sandler, you're like, ugh, fuck, what happened to this guy?  He's had so many bombs. 
[00:22:30]  I like the fact he mentioned horrors in the porn.  You don't mind it?  No, it's okay.  Because it's not over the top trying to be hilarious.  It's like if it was trying to be hilarious and going too, it's okay.  And it went on and on.  Oh, did it go, it's not, this is not almost over?  It kind of went on and on.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Sandy, screw you.  Screw you.  We'll get through you.  We'll get through you.  That's Paul Schaefer. 
[00:23:00]  Oof.  That was nice.  We believe this two-chill pass.  Like when Sanchez fumbled into an ass.  And during the playoffs, A-Rod telling girls in the crowd, I want to do you.  The Mets have sucked since 86.  Isaiah tried to ruin the Knicks.  But now Jason, Kidd, and the boys can freaking school you. 
[00:23:30]  Hallelujah.  And applause with those sports things.  That's a good way to get applause.  Local sports things.  We'll get through you.  You fucking Julia.  I should have said that just to everybody be shook.  Yeah.  You should have a picture of Bernie Madoff.  It just reminded me of something very good. 
[00:24:00]  Because we're New Yorkers.  The FedEx scare of 2010.  The low hands getting busted again and again.  The lady who said she was a man right after she blew you.  Sorry, that was just me.  Trump's comb-over always making us sick. 
[00:24:30]  The congressman who tweeted his dick.  The mayor's band, the mayor's band, the mayor's band, a 32-ounce mountain do-yo.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Sandy, screw ya.  Screw ya.  We'll freaking kung-fu ya.  Kung-fu ya.  Cause we're New Yorkers.  Is that it? 
[00:25:00]  And Jersey.  Oh, jeez.  You've taken your share of hits.  The situation always showing his tits.  The turnpike exit 13 stinking like pooh-ya.  You lost the Nets and now they're good.  But we're still the Hudson Brotherhood.  Together we'll give Sandy a big fuck-u-la.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah. 
[00:25:30]  Connecticut to-yo.  To-yo.  We'll get through-yo.  We'll get through-yo.  Cause we're New Yorkers.  He's terrific.  He's terrific.  Thanks.  Yeah.  All right.  Come on, guys.  Good job.  Jimmy set us straight.  I really like it.  It really isn't bad.  I mean, it's too bad you get to that point with him. 
[00:26:00]  It just puts a bad taste in your mouth when you have fucking, you know.  The second you see him.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, Jack and Jill.  Oh, God, yeah.  This is gonna be the one.  Yeah, that's what it is.  It's the Jack and Jill kind of shit.  Oh, Christ.  That makes you go like, yeah.  That was good.  It was a little edgy, you know.  Yeah, I was surprised he said that stuff.  Like, getting blown.  After she had a, she was a man after she blew you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Cause Chris Rock got a laugh when he said not the Wu-Tang part of Staten Island. 
[00:26:30]  But I didn't see anybody really getting any laughs.  It seemed like a tough room to get big laughs in.  Well, I think Billy Crystal.  Oh.  Yeah, he tore it up.  Another idiot on Twitter.  You know, you're making fun of Billy Crystal, but you would fucking just kiss his ass if he  was in that studio.  I gotta make it perfectly clear.  I've never been a Billy Crystal fan.  Ever.  And he's a Long Island fucking homegrown guy.  Usually you support them.  I fucking hate Billy Crystal.  It has to be said.  He's not funny.  Holy fuck.  Enough with this guy. 
[00:27:00]  Not.  Not funny.  He just wants everyone to fucking think he's God's gift to comedy.  Yeah.  Go away.  We don't need you.  We don't need you.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Yeah.  I'm going to think of Screw Ya all day.  That fucking, that cadence of Sandy Screw Ya.  Right.  It's like the John Valby song.  Did they?  They should have had Valby.  Hey, my God.  Hey, my God.  Ah.  Did they bleep out shit on certain channels? 
[00:27:30]  It sounded like certain rap things being bleeped.  I think so, because...  Wait, what channel did you see it on?  I was watching it on, uh...  I was watching it on AMC.  Epic.  And...  Oh, so you got to hear all the curses?  Yeah.  Well, we got to hear all the curses, too, because the guy that was in charge of the fucking button  was like a second behind.  Yeah, yeah.  And my point, because Jimmy brought this up and it reminded me of something, it's like,  this is how fucked up we are as a society.  They're showing complete devastation in these vignettes, where people have lost their homes 
[00:28:00]  and family members and all their shit and fires and just nothing but devastation of people  crying.  That's okay, but you have to beep fuck.  Beep.  That's so...  We're so stupid as a society.  As a society.  I'll tell you right now, as a parent, bring that into the discussion, I'd much rather  have my kid hear a fuck or a shit on TV than that devastation crap.  Yeah, that's just depressing.  Where they're showing kids crying, like, oh, used to go to the boardwalk and the rollercoaster's 
[00:28:30]  not there anymore.  If my kid was old enough, he would be fucking crying in the corner over that, not over fuck  or shit.  And these are cable channels that were beeping in.  It's not even...  These are not FCC regulations.  Cable channels have no FCC jurisdiction over them whatsoever.  Right.  They didn't have to.  I made it on purpose.  I was looking for a channel that wasn't going to bleep shit.  You know what?  I didn't think of it.  I didn't know.  I didn't either.  I just assumed that this was the one feed that everyone got. 
[00:29:00]  But it didn't really matter.  PBS was way behind.  I flipped it because I thought I saw it being beeped.  And I forget what channel I was watching.  And PBS...  Very far.  Kanye was on live and fucking PBS was still on The Who.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I noticed some tweets where people were tweeting shit from like an hour before.  Yeah.  Oh, you mean E-Rock?  Oh.  E-Rock has a special feed.  E-Rock has a special feed.  He is tweeting from the future.  E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:29:30]  People around here were actually pissed off that he was releasing certain information.  Yes.  Which I'm happy about.  I heard about that.  Wait.  You got in trouble?  E-Rock, comment.  It's nice to me.  You'll probably hear something after the show, I'm sure.  Okay.  We'll get Sam in here for this one a little later.  I kind of was mad at E-Rock because I wanted to be a little surprised.  Right?  Oh, well.  Because I didn't have the set list.  You shouldn't have been following Eric.  I guess Eric had the set list.  So I read his... 
[00:30:00]  He was on my feed.  And I say, coming up next, drunk uncle.  I'm like, fuck.  I don't want to know this stuff.  I want to be surprised.  E-Rock, comment.  Comment.  E-Rock.  You're setting me up for something here.  What?  He automatically did not just come and being annoyed at the same time.  It's only taken eight years for him to be on to us.  You're setting me up for something. 
[00:30:30]  And here comes Sam, of course.  Oh, God.  He thinks we're setting him up for something.  Sam, what's the story with E-Rock?  I'm very confused.  What happened?  I mean, there was a set list that a couple people around here got their hands on yesterday.  Uh-huh.  But it's because we were broadcasting it.  Right.  And that was kind of an inside thing.  And so, I mean, the rumors going around are that they're kind of pissed that, you know,  one of our guys was leaking the set list.  You know what I mean? 
[00:31:00]  Because it looks bad for the company.  Why?  Like, the company can't, like, we're the one company that couldn't handle having the set list  because one of our employees.  Right, right.  That's what I heard.  And why do you think somebody would get the set list and feel compelled to tweet who's  coming up next before everybody else knows?  Why do I think?  Yeah.  Why do you think, in your personal opinion, someone would do that?  Well, I think it's probably because they'd want the world to know how cool they are.  But if you're going to think. 
[00:31:30]  But if you're going to be cool, why would you only tweet stuff that's going to happen  in 30 seconds?  Yeah.  Yeah, why not, like, tweet, like, the name of the song Paul McCartney in Nirvana?  Right.  Yeah, there you go.  An hour before it happened.  That would have trended on Twitter and it would have been because of you.  Huge.  That would have been huge, actually.  Well, maybe you don't actually have as inside of a track as you want people to think that  you do, you know?  Wait, do you think you wanted people to think you had an inside track? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, I mean, I think that's obvious, yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah, I think he wanted people to be like, oh, man, this is a guy who works in the media.  This is a guy who's got a lot of, maybe he's backstage right now, who knows?  And saying shit like, like, oh, I wish I had the info that Iraq has.  How do you know all of this?  Right, yeah.  So if I pull up his Twitter, we can read them all?  Let's see them.  Okay.  Yeah, let's see.  Yeah, yeah, pull them up.  Let's go to Iraq's Twitter feed from last night.  It was fun tweeting during the show.  That was a lot of fun. 
[00:32:30]  There was a lot of stuff going on.  I don't see anything I'm talking about.  Iraq, Iraq, what?  Oh, there's one.  Next, Kanye West performs, later joined by Mike Myers to parody their Katrina benefit  appearance.  There's parentheses, lie.  Oh, okay.  That's just a joke.  All right, but where is...  Where's all the ones you were talking about?  I remember seeing them last night in the feed.  It's weird.  Iraq, Iraq, where is it?  Iraq, what happened to the feed?  Iraq, what happened?  Because the concert is over.  But why would you... 
[00:33:00]  But these are...  They don't disappear.  It's invisible ink.  You delete tweets from things that you've tweeted in the past when it's over?  Wouldn't you have no timeline left?  Isn't everything eventually over?  Why wouldn't you want them?  People could go back and watch them and read them.  Like, that's what you...  But there's, like, at least seven tweets about the concert that aren't deleted.  Yeah.  Iraq, comment?  Yeah, what?  What's happening?  The show was over, so I removed them.  But you didn't...  Maybe just the controversial ones? 
[00:33:30]  Come on.  Is there anything about the concerts, New York?  Yeah.  Well, there's, you know, is Adam Sandler doing a song parody at 12-12-12 concert?  Why would you take that off?  It's just a question.  Yeah, that...  You already know the answer to that, so...  Yeah, why did you delete that one?  That would be a useless tweet.  You rock?  They're trying to make this a bigger deal than it really is.  I...  That's not...  I mean, I've heard people are upset.  Like your waistline, Ralph.  All right.  Fair enough.  Good for you, Rock.  I just don't know why some of them...  Helping us out a little bit last night. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you.  And then deleting all of them.  Not all of them.  The fear.  The jokey ones are still out of fear.  Were you scared?  No.  The show's over.  So you went back and just deleted them?  It's not like people are going to Twitter slash E-Rock to get, like, the latest news and  you need to keep it up.  It's a Twitter feed.  No one deletes their tweets.  No.  I do it every time.  And no one deletes just some of them.  Right.  No, you don't.  There's still seven or eight Sandy tweets on his timeline.  Yeah, why do you have Sandy tweets and why do you have some from the concert? 
[00:34:30]  What, did you go back and pick and choose, like, the ones that are the least entertaining  you left up?  No one deletes time-sensitive tweets.  It just becomes part of the past of your timeline.  I've always done it.  Maybe.  Yes, I have.  Has he?  When you watch award shows and stuff like that, the next day I take them all down.  But why?  It's not like you're going to, like...  Yeah, because people could still enjoy them.  Right.  Get a little retrospective.  It's not like...  This concert's still pretty hot today.  Yeah.  Plus, they go on E-Rock Radio and go, wow, look at what he said about Roger Daltrey.  Yeah, what was an E-Rock tweet? 
[00:35:00]  This is neat.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  Thank you.  Well, it's because...  I said it.  All the...  The only tweets that were deleted are the spoilers.  Like, everything about the concert is still there.  Yeah, why is that, E-Rock?  It's a good thing that I still have them on my timeline.  Ah!  Yeah.  They're only on my timelines.  They're just not on mine.  E-Rock, why the vagary?  There's no vagary.  More E-Rock vagary.  No vagary.  In all fairness...  You're trying to make this something more important than it is.  I'm not.  These guys pretty much are, but I'm saying this much. 
[00:35:30]  There's some vagary here, because you did leave other tweets up that you already know  the answer to.  It was also really, really late when I'm like, all right, show's over, started going through  it, and just removed all the set lists.  Sam, why do you think somebody, if they were tweeting the timeline, tweeting the set list  during the timeline, why do you think they would then delete it, but not delete all of them?  Why do I think, hypothetically?  Yeah, hypothetically.  Well, I think because they would go back and be like, oh, I probably wasn't supposed to 
[00:36:00]  make all this information public.  No.  It's a little scary.  I don't want the bosses to have that.  Were you a little nervous, E-Rock?  No.  Are you coming?  All right.  No, not at all.  Oh.  All right.  I do it for a lot of live events.  Oh, yeah?  We just don't know why he does the things he does.  I don't think he knows.  We shouldn't question.  We shouldn't question the Lord, either.  I can't think of a good reason.  Or the Lord.  The Lord.  We shouldn't question the Lord.  Sorry, Eric.  All right.  Whatever.  Fuck.  I figured out why I don't like Billy Crystal, by the way. 
[00:36:30]  Oh.  We didn't really spend enough time on him.  He was the only guy.  It's a concert to raise a shitload of money in front of two billion people.  Yeah.  I believe he's the only guy that says his name and then waits for an applause break.  Oh.  I think that's what it is.  Oh, God.  Yes.  I think he was the only one that there was that slight delay of, like, I'm Billy Crystal.  Then he's just waiting for everyone to be like, here it comes.  All right.  Billy Crystal.  What I got to put up with.  Oh, I'm Billy Crystal. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, I'd love to just be able to talk, but I got to wait.  I got to wait.  I mean, yeah.  Oh.  He really admired me, and I'm just going to take it in for a little bit before I say what  I have to say.  Did you comment on something about his hair erosion from the storm?  I said Hurricane Sandy did a number on his forehead.  On his forehead.  That hair of his now goes right to the middle of his head and sticks up.  I was too busy trying to get my stupid tweets out, but I got to say, man, the listeners that  at least follow me, there were some funny fucking people out there. 
[00:37:30]  I just couldn't keep up with everything I was trying to do at one time.  But someone, what the fuck did they say about his hair?  They said that he looks like a bald man with a stuffed animal, like being shown from behind  or something.  I don't have the exact wording of the tweet, but that one made me laugh.  What is going on with his hair?  That's all sorts of shit going on, too, right?  Yeah.  That's some hair plug action.  It looks very dry.  Well, because when you have that straight line going all the way down on the side like 
[00:38:00]  that, that's a give away.  Oh, yeah.  I think so.  He probably did try to get something going on.  That's just Billy Crystal.  And he's just, yeah.  He's another one, like, that just comes out, and you instantly go, ugh.  Why is that?  People love him, obviously.  Why is that?  A bunch of very successful films.  I never liked his stand-up.  You liked his stand-up?  Oh, Jimmy went to the bathroom.  Fuck.  I'll ask him when he gets back.  Jimmy. 
[00:38:30]  What'd I miss, guys?  It is a weird reaction.  I think with certain people, is it that we get so used to seeing them, or we see them  like, because people's reaction is like that to Sandler sometimes, and it's like, why?  I don't know what it is, either.  I think it's, he's just not humble.  Yeah.  You want some of these guys to just be humble.  But then when they are humble, like, oh, I don't know if I can pull this off.  Then you get mad at that, too.  Yeah, so what do they need to do? 
[00:39:00]  I guess somewhere in between.  I don't know.  There's just something unlikable about Billy Crystal.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  I never got with him.  Sorry.  A couple of movies he was in, I kind of enjoyed.  Did you like Search for Curly's Gold?  Oh, God.  The first one, though, wasn't bad.  Yeah, yeah.  But I also think he plays parts where you feel like anyone could kind of do that role.  There's no standout part where you go, I could see Billy Crystal doing that.  No, I don't see that either.  But he's just got that look and that type of comedy that Hollywood just goes, yeah, let's 
[00:39:30]  get him for this fucking role.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's in that new movie with, what, Bette Midler and their grandparents or something?  Oh, boy.  Parental guidance.  And there looks to be some kind of message in there.  There's mischief going on when the grandparents are.  It seems to me that this movie is.  The parents and the kids, they have their life, but it's a little off whack.  And all they need now is the grandparents to show up and be around them with all their  problems.  But then they realize the grandparents are helping them get back together as a family. 
[00:40:00]  And the children are more respectful.  How about this, Hollywood?  Not every comedy has to have a fucking message in the end.  Oh, it's all a message.  Just have fun and be stupid.  Get a couple of dumb lines out and end the movie.  You don't like the tagline?  Why is there always a lesson?  Huh?  You don't like the tagline for the movie?  What is the tagline?  Here come the grandparents.  There go the rules.  Because they're the rebels.  Oh, I see.  They're the wild ones.  They're supposed to be the ones that keep everyone in check. 
[00:40:30]  But in the end, they're the problem.  And that's what happens when grandparents visit.  It's not like the kids go, why does the couch stink when grandpa gets up?  No, they're cool and fun.  I bet you the parents have too many rules.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe the kids are being brought up a little too strict.  Yeah, right?  But the grandparents, they're going to show them.  Can we see the dumb trailer?  This isn't the trailer, is it?  I hope not.  Wouldn't it be great if the rules they broke were no nude photos of the children posted 
[00:41:00]  to the internet?  Put it on hold.  I know.  Put it on hold.  I'm trying.  Put it on hold.  I can't.  Put it on hold.  It's right there.  On hold.  I'm going to start a fire here.  Mom.  Dad.  Phil has to go away next week.  And we need someone to watch the kids.  So I was wondering, would you want to?  We'd love to.  Oh.  I'm not going.  You're going.  That's what I meant.  We practically never see our grandchildren.  Her whole way of raising her kids is a giant in our face.  It's her generation. 
[00:41:30]  It's just their way.  What are you looking for, sailor?  I'll help you out.  It's an omen.  What's it an omen of?  Impending doom.  Oh, my God.  Grandpa tells lots of jokes that you won't get.  Just laugh.  Hello, boy.  Still single?  There's a way that we talk to our kids.  Or you would say, quit your whining, you're giving me a headache.  We would say, use your words.  That's not bad.  Not bad.  She looks like a 12-year-old widow.  Maybe not those words. 
[00:42:00]  Oh.  Strike three.  You're out of there.  There are no outs in this game.  How is that possible?  They hit until they get on base.  You are out.  I'm not.  You're out.  I'm not.  You're out.  You're out.  Oh, boy.  My father doesn't listen.  How is this Artie's fault?  The world was taken so far.  And for a good reason.  Because after your kids grow up, your husband is the one who stays.  Oh.  You know what grandparenting is?  A second chance.  That's pretty good.  Oh.  And then the moon. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  Now we're getting back to where they understand each other.  Take great kids.  And you're a really good mother.  Oh.  He's talking to Andrea Yates.  Speak to my granddaughter like that again.  And there will be nothing left of you but some red hair and an accent.  Is that clear, comrade?  Dasvidaniya.  You threatened your violin teacher?  Alice, your dad and I have bent over backwards to try to do things your way.  You haven't bent over at all.  Oh, I'm bent.  Believe me, I'm bent.  He's holding ice on his nuts.  Pick me up here.  Don't leave me stranded. 
[00:43:00]  Have I ever left you stranded?  Four times when I was a kid.  It's like she thinks we're idiots.  By the way, where is she?  Where have you been?  Oh.  I know.  You've been stranded, right?  Oh, my God.  Coming Christmas Day.  She looks great.  Huh?  Marissa Tomei.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Is that her?  Yes.  Isn't she like two years younger than fucking Billy Crystal?  Jesus.  She's well into her 40s at this point.  Yeah, she does look good.  She's 48.  Wow.  That is... 
[00:43:30]  Was there a laugh in there?  Was there one laugh in there?  Let me think.  No.  Hollywood loves making those type of movies.  I bet that movie will do very well on Christmas Day.  Of course.  That's what's so fucked up.  Oh, yeah.  We're in the fucking wrong.  Yeah.  God, that was...  You could tell exactly what's going to happen the entire movie from that trailer.  They learn from the grandparents.  They think they're old and should be tossed to the wayside. 
[00:44:00]  But you know what?  Old people have a purpose in life and can help us and learn and just get out of the way in  the supermarket.  Get out of the way.  So this all started because Billy Crystal was obviously part of that huge concert last  night.  12, 12, 12.  Here's Billy Crystal.  Hello, everybody.  Hello, everybody.  See?  See?  That right there was...  He didn't say his name, but it's like, I don't even have to say my name. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  Everyone knows who I am.  My face is now on the big screen, so let me just fucking sit back and enjoy.  Hello, everybody.  Let me bask.  Hello, everybody.  Good evening, everybody.  Well...  Six seconds.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I have to first of all say what a thrill it is to be here, Matt.  To hint...  In his mind, he just got a standing ovation and he had to wait it out. 
[00:45:00]  He had to wait it out.  He had to ride that out.  He had to ride that out.  Fucking delusional.  I have to first of all say what a thrill it is to be here, Madison Square Garden, and I  can't believe that Bruce Springsteen is my opening act.  And I can't believe that Bruce Springsteen is my opening act.  Let's hear it for all my opening acts.  It's a Moss joke.  It is a Moss joke. 
[00:45:30]  Moss does that well.  Let's hear it for all the opening acts.  All right.  Good evening.  I'm Billy Crystal, and welcome to 12-12-12, the concert for Sandy Relief, presented by Chase.  This is amazing.  You can feel the electricity in the building, which means that Long Island power is not involved.  This concert is being carried by 37 television networks in the United States and 100 others worldwide. 
[00:46:00]  It's also broadcasting on clear channel radio stations across the country  and is streaming on dozens of the biggest websites.  It's being made available to 2 billion people.  Jesus Christ.  Enough of that bobble boobooey.  Do someone yell about bobble boobooey.  I thought I heard that.  I thought I heard that. 
[00:46:30]  And it's streaming on dozens of the biggest websites.  It's being made available to 2 billion people.  That's what that guy thinks of you, Billy Crystal.  Shut up.  I'm a boobooey.  It's just so unnecessary.  Dude, how long?  20 years?  Right.  How long have people been yelling that out?  It's being made available to 2 billion people.  It's being seen as far away tonight as China, Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. 
[00:47:00]  And no matter who you are or where you live, as you watch tonight, I know you're all thinking the same thing.  How is Homeland going to end?  We gather here once again following a disaster to help our own.  So much has changed.  Jimmy, what do you think of this?  I didn't, I'm really, I wish I would have seen it live.  I'm glad I'm enjoying it.  You're enjoying it, huh?  Yeah.  To help our own. 
[00:47:30]  So much has changed as I walked out on the stage to open the concert for New York following 9-11.  In 2001, Mayor Giuliani was on the lookout for Al-Qaeda.  Today, Mayor Bloomberg is on the lookout for 18-ounce sodas.  Oh, give a double gun.  Now, here we are in 2012, having to come to grips with another epic disaster.  Wow.  They're calling Sandy a storm of biblical proportion.  And since that's in the Old Testament, I'm sure they'll try to find some way to blame the Jews.  Oh, wow. 
[00:48:00]  Edgy.  Good stuff.  We've never seen anything like this storm.  At one point, the water was so high, police made Mayor Bloomberg stay in the shallow end of the city.  Wow.  But people come together in disasters.  Like Governor Chris Christie and President Obama hanging out together.  They spent so much time together, it looked like a bad remake of the movie 48 Hours.  But I think politicians and all of us can learn something from Governor Chris Christie.  And not just the best place to hoard Twinkies. 
[00:48:30]  The governor threw politics aside and Mitt Romney and actually did something for the people of his state.  Oh, boy.  It's a bit hacky.  That's some borscht belt comedy.  That's some hacky shit.  That's some Catskills stuff right there.  What?  Ah, well, and the older he gets, the more like he just sounds like an old Jew.  Bah, there you can feel the electricity in here. 
[00:49:00]  Psycho Bob says Billy Crystal now looks like the guy he played in The Princess Bride.  That is pretty good when someone's a young actor and they play an older person, they put that prosthetic makeup on, and then they get old and look exactly like it.  He just never, he never liked them.  No.  Never liked his SNL characters that everyone thought were terrific.  He didn't like, you look marvelous. 
[00:49:30]  Not a, uh, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Not a one.  What else did he do on SNL?  I'm trying to remember now.  You look marvelous.  Oh.  He did.  You look marvelous.  And then there was that, uh, other one, uh, he wasn't the church lady, right?  No.  That was, uh.  No.  Who was the church lady?  Oh, he did, um, he did Gumby, right?  What do you mean?  Oh, no, that was right.  That was Eddie Murphy.  How many years was he on?  Was he only on one year, two years?  He was on a while. 
[00:50:00]  Many.  Let's see what I did.  What other character did he do?  Did he, wasn't he supposed to be in the original SNL, and then he turned it down.  Really?  Oh, that was smart.  And then he came back years later.  That was not a good move.  Still had a great career, but.  One season.  Billy Crystal was only on one season, huh?  His characters were Al Minkman.  Buddy Young Jr., Lou Goldman, Ricky, Tony Minetti, Willie, he did some impressions. 
[00:50:30]  Wait, is Willie the jazz player?  What?  Oh, no, no.  And Buddy Young Jr. is a comic he played in Mr. Saturday Night, so I didn't know that was  an SNL character.  He did the jazz guy?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm just curious.  We don't have to play any more clips from him, please.  Are you sure?  Yeah, please.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Positive.  So he did You Look Marvelous, and that was it, right?  That's it.  Impressions, yeah.  Oh, Fernando Llamas.  Well, yeah, that was the You Look Marvelous. 
[00:51:00]  No, I was trying to remember the name of the character.  Okay.  Oh, he did do Sammy.  He did Sammy Davis Jr.  You liked that one.  Yeah.  I remember you.  No, I remember you.  I don't think so.  Muhammad Ali.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  That was pretty terrific.  That was believable.  He did a De Niro impression last night.  He did?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh.  He did a De Niro impression.  Did he?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't see that.  He did from Raging Bull. 
[00:51:30]  You know, you didn't knock me down.  That's what it was.  He did it as far as, like, New York.  I just got to point out, that Brooke Broad on CNN, holy fuck.  Oh.  She looks like Blair from The Facts of Life.  You think?  Yeah, she's pretty.  There's something about her, man.  Wow.  She looks good.  Her voice is, like, manly, unfortunately.  But she's one of those blonde reporters on CNN that...  Oh.  Look at her.  Yeah, she's pretty.  Yeah.  Why don't we break?  We'll do the second half of the big... 
[00:52:00]  12-12-12?  12-12-12 concert.  I want to play Comfortably Nome today.  Is that cool?  Sure.  You didn't hear it?  No.  Hear it.  Do you want to play it from there, or do you want to watch the video?  What's easiest?  Whatever.  Is that good quality on the internet there?  All right, fine.  Is the whole video there?  Yes.  All of it.  Yeah, so Roger Waters doing his thing, and then, of course, Eddie Vedder helped him out with Comfortably Nome.  This was the highlight for me.  If other people had different highlights, I certainly would love to hear it.  And we got to get into the Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl thing. 
[00:52:30]  I finally went to bed after Billy Joel, so I don't know what I missed.  You haven't heard it yet, right?  I don't even know what I missed.  That's great.  All right, cool.  So we'll discuss all that shit after the break.  Of course we'll be discussing Roger Daltrey and his fucking chest.  You know what?  You should play it just in case there's, like, buffering issues here.  Uh-oh.  Well, I don't want to, you know, leave Fato.  What's on the way?  On the way is Roger Daltrey, some Kanye West shit.  McCartney?  McCartney, Steve Buscemi. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, God.  I was the fucking drunk.  That was hilarious.  And I know they're doing the right thing, so don't get me wrong.  But, I mean, really, really blowing apart those stereotypes of the drunk fireman.  That was classic.  And Chris Martin from Coldplay.  Oh, and Drunk Uncle.  Do we play that?  Drunk Uncle.  Well, we got that on the way for you, Jimmy, because I know you appreciate a good comedy piece.  I certainly do.  And some other shit, so we'll go to break with this. 
[00:53:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Eddie Vedder.  Sirius XM. 
[00:54:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  I guess happy birthday to Eminem or something?  Oh, is that it?  I don't know.  Why are you playing this, E-Rod?  I didn't want to play music that could deal with the concert and everything, so I just played something totally different from it.  I love E-Rod. 
[00:54:30]  He works in mysterious ways, I'm telling you.  He does.  He's very mysterious, Mr. E-Rod.  But there's a million things you're going to play.  All right, whatever.  Oh, you gotta love him.  All right.  Gotta love him.  So we're obviously, oh, we should mention that Quentin Tarantino's going to be here at 9 o'clock.  Yeah.  Very cool.  It's been a while.  He hasn't been here in like five years.  Yeah, five years. 
[00:55:00]  Something like that.  Since K-Rock.  K-Rock, yeah.  We thought we hit it off with the guy.  We're like, God, I can't wait for him to be a regular.  He's ready to go to his screening rooms.  Right.  L.A.  Wait, didn't he invite you guys to some movie at his house?  Of course he did.  It just didn't sound like him.  But it was another one of those things.  I get to L.A. every once in a while, and I'm like, oh, God, I have all these invites.  Yeah.  Where do I go?  But I don't have numbers, addresses, nothing.  You just gotta get a map of the Hollywood stars and show up at people's doors.  And those maps aren't even accurate.  No.  I learned that while I was out there. 
[00:55:30]  Someone fucking told me, oh, those maps, they haven't updated them in years.  Years.  Those celebrities moved from those houses a long time ago.  That's that scam.  Uh, the benefit concert for the Sandy Relief thing yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  How much money do you think they raised?  Um, 12, 12, 12.  I mean, supposedly 2 billion people saw this thing.  Uh, I don't know.  How much?  Wouldn't it be great if they just raised $40,000?  A big bust-a-roo.  Yeah, no one donated. 
[00:56:00]  The news said this morning they were still tallying it all up, but they were over $30 million so far.  I would think it would be hard.  It doesn't seem that much.  Right.  That's not even a dollar a person.  No, not even close.  You had to see all these guys in one place.  You know, that was worth $10 to me at least, man.  I gave $10.  I didn't donate.  I should.  I gave my $10.  Yeah.  So, um, where were we?  Billy Crystal, not funny. 
[00:56:30]  Bon Jovi we did.  We did, uh, Bruce's cock.  Bruce's giant dick.  Yeah.  Eddie Vedder.  Okay, yeah.  So Eddie Vedder and Comfortably Nome.  That was my highlight.  Anyone have a highlight from last night?  That was good right there.  Uh, not really a highlight.  I did like Clapton.  I thought he sounded great.  His voice was amazing.  He could hit every note.  Very smooth.  I liked it.  He's kind of, people are going to kill me for this, but he's kind of forgettable, though.  Well, yeah.  He's so damn good.  He's like almost forgettable.  Yeah, I'm not saying it was a, an amazing performance. 
[00:57:00]  He sat in a chair.  He's 68.  Yeah.  I was looking up all these ages going, holy fuck.  Yeah.  He doesn't look 68.  And some guy bashes me.  He's like, yeah, you like that fake blues thing?  Like, like they, they see that as like fake blues.  Like, I don't care about the blues.  I just liked the way he sounded.  His voice was really good.  Clapton's great, but I don't know.  I was never a huge fan.  No.  So, neither was I, to be honest. 
[00:57:30]  He's great with his instrument.  Yeah.  He's perfect.  Yeah.  They sounded good.  His songs were perfect.  He didn't fuck up at all, but I don't know.  Yeah.  That, I thought Billy Joel sounded good, too.  What songs did he sing?  I saw her, too.  I bet you he sang a song about where they kind of mentioned a lot of like New York things.  New York things?  I'm going to guess.  Yeah.  We're like, wow, I can relate to this song.  I know a lot of these places he's singing about.  Chinatown? 
[00:58:00]  Chinatown?  Broadway?  Huh?  Lights go out on Broadway.  Yeah, I've been to Broadway.  Yeah, he did a few.  What did he do?  He did, um, I seen the lights go out on Broadway.  He did that one.  He did, uh, moving.  I'm moving out.  Wait a minute.  Miami 2017.  Yes.  Damn.  You think that's going to be a big deal in five years?  Oh, Jesus, right?  Miami 2017.  Yeah, weird.  Also known as Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  The real name of that song is Miami 2017.  I never would have known that, by the way.  Anthony Song, Moving Out.  Yes.  New York State of Mind, of course.  The River of Dreams, You May Be Right, and Only the Good Die Young.  Oh.  Yeah.  No Piano Man.  Uh, no.  No.  I am the Piano Man.  Sing us a song.  You're the Piano Man.  Piano Man.  Piano Man.  Man, what are you doing here?  I would have went with Captain Jack.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  We'll get you high tonight. 
[00:59:00]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, somebody said last night.  Or the Ballad of Billy the Kid.  Oh, right?  Fuck, I love that song.  Ah, that's a good, that's an old, that's an old Billy Joel.  I probably heard it.  Yeah.  And what's the other one with the, uh, the Angry, uh, the Angry Young Man?  The Angry Young Man.  Angry Young Man.  The Angry Young Man.  The Angry Young Man.  There's some great piano in that song.  Yeah.  It goes off.  Yeah, they, uh, somebody tweeted last night, I don't know why I just remember this, but  the way Roland talks, he talks in hashtag, because all the words, all the words are just 
[00:59:30]  together, there's no spaces.  He speaks hashtag.  That's pretty good.  All right, so what do you want to hear next?  We got some, uh, Buscemi.  Oh, yeah, that was, uh, very uncomfortable.  We got the who.  Who, who.  I love that they opened with that.  All I was thinking was Jimmy.  I know.  Who, who.  Who, who.  Who, who.  Who, who.  They don't say it enough in the song.  Jesus.  Endless.  You think?  Oh, my God.  The whole thing. 
[01:00:00]  It was just, they won't stop saying it.  Who are you?  Who, who.  Who, who.  You go, I get a Coke, get back.  Who, who.  What'd you miss?  400 who are you's.  Who, who.  Who, who.  But Roger Daltrey's chest is terrific.  I think we could all agree.  Yeah.  Uh, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  It was, it was definitely looking like, uh, Ricardo Montalban in Wrath of Cotton.  He had that same kind of chest thing going on there.  Oh, yeah.  All shaved down.  He couldn't wait to show two billion people that his chest is still in relatively good  shape.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  If you blow off all the scarring.  Regardless of what the fuck was going on down below.  Yeah.  He had a scar.  I don't even know what, it might be like Pete Townsend might have taken an axe to him  or something.  The thing is, it was a scar, and then he had like holes near it where it looked like stitches,  but it was so far away from the scar, and there were only like three of them on either  side.  I think it was lipo?  I don't know what the fuck it was.  It reminded me of another tweet that I'm not going to do justice.  Somebody said, did he, did he sew up his, his own fucking surgery? 
[01:01:00]  You guys are fucking funny last night.  That's a good one.  A lot of you guys made me laugh hard.  He sewed up his own surgery.  Something like that.  Yeah, because it's a fucked up scar.  With his, I don't know.  Wow.  I mean, but then again, he's, you know, he's, he's, he's pushing 70 at this point,  right?  Holy shit.  Is that a wig?  I said it was a wig, and a bunch of the broads out there were all depressed that I point  out that most likely Roger Daltrey has a wig. 
[01:01:30]  How could they not notice?  That's the first thing I thought of.  Is that a fucking piece?  I don't know.  He's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's another one that just always had a very full head of  hair.  Right.  Usually if someone has a wig, you could find some photos of them at some point in their  career where they were thinning.  Like, like fucking Elton John, it's obvious.  He went from, like, having very little hair, starting to go completely bald, then he just  wore a hat all the time, and then he had that dumb wig he put on his head.  Maybe there's a transitional phase, I don't know.  Yeah?  We add hair, or I don't know. 
[01:02:00]  It's very weird.  He never, ever looked like he was thinning.  And then you make the, and then you take a year off and do the switcheroo or something.  The old switcheroo.  The old switcheroo.  I hope no one notices.  Some of the guys have done the old switcheroo.  Yeah?  Sure.  Poo-hoo.  Rumors abound.  We know a little more, don't we?  From an old client.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  That person swears.  I don't know.  Anyway, Roger Daltry and the Who sounded great. 
[01:02:30]  Well, you know.  The Pete Townsend windmill was uncomfortable to watch, because you're like, man, you just  know that could just cause something.  He looked like he was shooing away angry parents.  I was up with the red fucking hanky.  That tweet was hilarious.  The fucking Superman's, the little kid's Superman pajama feet.  That was very funny.  Oh, thanks.  Underoos.  Because I kept looking at this stupid thing, and I couldn't, I knew there was something 
[01:03:00]  there, and I could come up with nothing for it.  I was going with, I was trying to do something, yeah, I don't even, he didn't love, yeah.  Huh?  Roger D was a, I mean, he's obviously up there in age and can't hit the notes he used to,  but he does a good job.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  He did a great job.  He should have had Eddie Vedder come out, though.  Eddie Vedder loves singing Who songs.  Yeah, yeah.  I was surprised Eddie Vedder didn't come back out and do something with the Who. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, that would have been cool.  They respect each other, too.  That would have been great.  Oh, love, rain or me.  Rain or me.  Rain or me.  To the idiots out there, I do know it's rain, R-E-I-G-N.  Right.  Jesus.  It's raining over you like a king or something.  Yes.  A kingdom or something.  I get it.  But I went for a dumb R-A-I-N joke last night.  And the song starts with thunder and lightning and rainfall and shit, right?  Like I said, you know, the victims of Sandy certainly don't want to hear a song called Rain 
[01:04:00]  on me.  You know, it's rain, R-E-I-G-N, though.  And it's or me.  And it's or me.  Look, I don't know that.  I fucking played the song a thousand times on the radio.  Go for a dumb, stupid tweet.  Relax.  Relax.  Shouldn't ruin your night.  Right.  It was rain, R-E-I-G-N, in capital letters, not R-A-I-N. 
[01:04:30]  Your comedic tweet wasn't accurate.  Yeah, exactly.  How many of those last night?  Your attempted comedy wasn't accurate.  Right.  All right.  But the level of anger, it's like, relax, we're going to be okay.  That's some super, like a who, one of those who super fans was tweeting me.  I'm like, I like the who.  Don't worry about it.  We all like the who.  We can't make a little fun.  Roger Daltrey's showing his nipples.  I think we should make fun a little bit here. 
[01:05:00]  And then they sang with Keith Moon.  That was just strange.  That was weird.  It's like, all right, this is for, you know, the Sandy victims.  And then you're doing this tribute to Keith Moon, which is, just came off as weird and  like, eww.  Yeah.  And then Roger Daltrey saluting the screen at the end.  Oh, did he?  Oh, that was so douchey.  Someone, by the way, sent me a screen cap of Bruce Springsteen's cock that we talked  about.  Oh, that's a good one.  Very.  Now, that's not, it looks like his balls, it looks like his dick is pointing up into  his right pocket. 
[01:05:30]  Is that what you guys are talking about?  That's...  And his balls, let me see.  No, but I mean, is that his cock pointing up by his pocket?  That's his cock head.  Yeah.  Where?  By his...  Point the cock head.  Under the belt?  I think by his...  Well, no, there were even better pictures of his cock.  Look, look, look, look.  Is that his...  That couldn't be his cock.  He's got a giant rod.  It's going literally...  Up and to the right.  Up and to the right under his belt.  That's his dick.  Well, at one point, though, it was hanging down, like, just in sort of that, you know, a good 
[01:06:00]  presentation, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As we call it on the show.  That would have to be.  That couldn't be his cock.  And then it looked like he had to move it up and to the right to keep it down.  Oh, boy.  Here's another one of it.  Oh, my goodness.  I told you.  Holy mackerel.  Holy...  Wait, is that a real...  Oh, that's you?  That's a still photo.  No, that's him.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Someone sent me that on Tumblr.  Holy fuck.  What the fuck?  Wait a minute.  It's wrapping around to the back of his body.  Yeah.  Wait, did you think that's it?  I don't know.  That couldn't be it.  That couldn't be his dick.  He wouldn't have this job if that was his dick. 
[01:06:30]  Wait, that might be his dick.  Fucking Bruce Diggler.  That's either his cock head or he's got, like, a golf ball in his right pocket.  Jesus.  No, I see it in these other pictures.  It looks like it's pointing down.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was all over the place is the point.  Yeah, yeah.  You couldn't tell what was his dick.  Bruce Branstein, my fucking manager.  And he was singing a song called Rise Up.  Yeah, yeah.  Rise Up.  He's talking to his butt.  I forgot to mention that earlier.  The song was Rise Up as his penis was on full display. 
[01:07:00]  Bruce's butt.  His fucking butt.  That album, though, with Wrecking Ball and Rise Up and there's a few other songs.  I mean.  I like it.  Roland turned me on to the album.  He burned me an illegal copy.  Oh.  I love free music.  And that fucking album is great.  Yeah.  There's not a bad song on it.  It's great.  What was the other song?  Death in My Hometown.  Death in My Hometown.  That's great.  Ooh.  The Shackalack one. 
[01:07:30]  Shackled and Drawn?  Yes.  Holy.  See, Jimmy knows.  Yeah.  I like it.  I like it.  It's actually on my fucking playlist.  I love this fucking album.  It's great.  It's great.  I heard it when we went and saw them.  I didn't even know there were new songs.  I don't know Springsteen that well.  I was like, fuck, this album is good.  John Foxx of Brooklyn.  The video of Keith Moon was great, though.  I agree.  I agree.  I do agree.  It was just a weird choice because you know the Who catalog.  There's so many songs you probably want to hear. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, that wasn't really one of them.  No.  Oh.  So here's a little taste of the Who.  I'm here in the field.  I'm put on my knees.  I get my way into my knees.  I don't need to fight 
[01:08:30]  To prove I'm right  No, I don't need to be forgiven  That's a big sound  There you go 
[01:09:00]  That's a big sound  He still could pull it off  Yeah, you figure he's that old  And the good thing about Roger Daltrey is  He's known for his voice cracking when he sings  He could just fucking crack, doesn't matter  Keith from Connecticut that certainly knows more about music than myself  He says that who's on tour doing Quadrophenia in its entirety  That's why they did the Keith Moon Bellboy thing  All right  So now it all makes sense  Because they're all trying to promote their shit  Right, yeah  As well as help people  That's really  That's got to be something 
[01:09:30]  You're looking up at a guy that still looks young  Because he was the drummer and then died  And then you're all fucking  Then you look over at Pete Townsend  And just, oh God  You know, live tweeting is so much fun  Because when you see Roger Daltrey, let's say, right?  Yeah  And you see that hair  You know everyone's on the clock  Like, who's going to come up with it?  Who's going to come up with it?  And no one really came up with anything  On that one, more or less  But someone that I don't even know  I was just  I saw it, you know, on the trending topics 
[01:10:00]  Yeah  They made a Vicki Lawrence mama reference  Oh God  Fucking Vicki Lawrence's mama hair  Right  That was  See, that's what I mean though  Like, it's like, fuck  And then you're like, fuck  I could have thought of that one  Yeah  But you're always on the clock  Going, all right  Who's going to come up with it?  Who's going to come up with the one  People are talking about  Yeah, these rockers  With the  They get their hair  At some point  It starts resembling an old lady's hair  It's fucked up  If you're lucky enough 
[01:10:30]  To keep your hair into old age  It will start looking like  An old lady's hair  Right  Look at Imus  Imus has a nice full head of hair  But it looks like  An old lady's hair now  That's really his hair, right?  Imus?  I think so, yeah  Yeah  We've been around him enough  Yeah, I think so  Yeah  We moved from the Stones  But we have a little taste  Of them doing Jumping Jack Flash, too  With Mick Jagger looking  A little rough  Yeah  I fell down 
[01:11:00]  To my feet  And I'm sore, baby  Yeah  And I'm round  And it runs out  And it runs out  And it runs out  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I'm round  With spikes back  To my head  Yeah  But it's all  All right  Something doesn't seem right 
[01:11:30]  He doesn't have command of that song  He wasn't singing it like he does on the record  Right  He wasn't up as high as he usually is  Or he's trying to protect his voice  Sometimes these guys, when they're on tour  They don't like doing other stuff  He seems to be slightly  Slightly  Behind  Not behind  But just slightly 
[01:12:00]  You know what I mean?  He's not out front there  Hmm  I wonder if these guys do these gigs  Like just to see that  They never see these other guys anymore  Right  Like when does Mick Jagger see McCartney  And fucking  And you know  Springsteen  And Clapton  And all the Who  It's just like a big reunion for these dudes  Hmm  They just want to hang out with their friends  Do you think they even care backstage  When they meet each other?  No  They're all fucking legends  Me with the camera back  I'm glad I wasn't there  I would have had a stroke  And ruined everybody's good time  No, they're all so used to each other 
[01:12:30]  I mean  This is the same lineup  You could have seen in 1974  Right  Like it would have been a legendary lineup in 75  Mm-hmm  This would have been impressive  Fucking 40 years ago  Yeah  Except for Jimmy Fallon  He wouldn't have been there  He was young  But you know what I mean?  These guys are so used to each other  Springsteen  Springsteen's like a new kid on the block from 84  Like by the time he came along  McCartney and the Stones  And the Who  Were 20 years into being famous  And Clapton  Isn't that fucked up to think?  Yeah  By the time  By the time like 
[01:13:00]  Born in the U  What was it?  Born in the USA  Was the one that put it  That was  84  I want to say 82  Oh was it?  No you might be right though  Although he was around in the 70s  Oh hell yeah  But I mean he was  He became a fucking household name with Born in the USA  He was pretty fucking big in the 70s though  Was he?  Yeah  He was pretty fucking  Yeah but like Born in the USA  Put him on that next level  Right right  Yeah yeah  But I mean Born and Ron didn't hurt  Huge  So 
[01:13:30]  Wow  We don't have the Drunk Uncle skit  I'll find him  Oh my god  That's too bad  How do we not have that?  That was a fucking highlight  Well comic relief here  And also Steve Buscemi  Who's 55 years old today  Really?  Yeah it's his birthday  Now it makes sense  That he was hanging around  With a lot of  A lot of drinking firemen  I don't want to call them drunks  I absolutely  Drinking firemen  I would have put him at older than that  He was hanging  His hand was shaking though  Oh Jesus  He was talking to Madison Square Garden 
[01:14:00]  Full of people  You could see his hand at one point  Like a lot of these actors  Yeah they're not used to  Talking in front of a gigantic  Fucking audience  That was  That was one of the highlights though  I mean  He  I think his part was supposed to be  Two minutes  And it was  Something was  Yeah  It was about 20 minutes long  And he's dragging other guys in  Dude the fat firemen  That came up to him  And just started yelling in his ear  And the guy  And then he's trying to have  Like a conversation  You've been in those situations  Where we've been on stage  And somebody tries to have  A conversation with you  While you're doing a show 
[01:14:30]  Like he's in front of  Literally  Two billion  Two billion people  And the guy's like  Steve  Steve  Remember me from the bar  And he's trying to talk to him  About like  Seeing him at some club  Right  It was great  Hilarious  Robin Hood  I'm back  Robin Hood is active  Providing the greybeards  With emergency funds  To sustain their post-storm assistance  Come on  Just come on in  Come on in

[01:18:30]  Than they should  Yeah  Like there's a funnier line  You could put there  And they  Absolutely  I know it's live TV  And it's fucking  Once a week  And it's a lot of work  But some of it  I'm like  What are you guys doing?

[01:23:30]  Yes  I see it out there  In radio land  People are tweeting  And on the instant feedback  They're like  Oh my god  That's so uncomfortable  And the lines weren't good  That's the problem  The lighting was horrible  Did he just make that up  You think on the spot  No  No no  It looked like he was  Read the teleprompter  At one point  He might have went off  Book a little bit  But it looked fairly  You know  Or maybe he had a  A cue card  I don't know how SNL does it  But ooh  The weird thing about SNL  Is they feel like  If they can get a character  On television multiple times  It's like this  Cultural thing 
[01:24:00]  That people would get  Like it used to be  Ah right  Yes  Yes  But it's not  Roseanne  Roseanne Adana  Exactly  But it made you laugh  Back then  Yeah the material was there  The writing was there  That's a horrible character  And the writing stinks  Lorne Michaels  Should be ashamed today  Probably is  Well he wrote  He signed off on that  I'm sure  You know  They probably went to him  And said look  You got a few minutes  On this  You know  This concert  What do you want to do  Yeah  And he had to be  The one that said  Let's do the drunk uncle  Seth do drunk uncle  Okay 
[01:24:30]  You think even Seth Meyers  Was like oh god  They must have known  Like when they started  Like oh boy  This isn't going well  Sure  He just kept calling him  Drunk uncle  Yeah  Oh drunk uncle  Oh drunk uncle  Anything to have more Seth words  And less drunk uncle words  Like oh Chip  Or oh Uncle Paul  Uncle Paul would have been  A great addition to this  Oh really  Yes  It would have bombed  But at least it would have  Made this radio audience  Enjoy it  That guy's on SNL  And we would never  Have him on this show  No  I would never have 
[01:25:00]  That guy on  Wow that was really  Uncomfortable  Yeah  It's not good  Not good  It was not at all good  We gotta do another break  For live reads and shit  So  Yeah  We'll do another break  Quentin Tarantino  We'll be here in about an hour  That's cool  And we'll finish up  This 12-12-12 concert  And then we'll move on  To some of the things  How's that sound  Good oh  What is left  We got Michael Stipe  Performing with Chris Martin  I didn't see any of that  I know  That's why I'm curious 
[01:25:30]  Of this shit  And the Paul McCarty  I want to know how that was  Because I couldn't stay up  Until 1.30  This thing ended at 1.30  Yeah  With Alicia Keys  She came back out  Did she  Yeah  She finished with Empire State of Mind  At 1.30  Yep  Did it sound good  As good as  Her voice sounds raspy  Did she always have a raspy voice though  No  And she was like hitting notes  Her voice sounded like  Someone with kind of a sore throat  Did they do the rap crap in that song  No  Just her 
[01:26:00]  Just her  Yeah  She's got a version  Where there's no rap  Right  And that should be a hit  It's not nearly  I understand  I'm just saying  Her voice is beautiful  She's great  And what she does  In the original song  Is great  So I can imagine  That it would be a good song  That's the part  Everybody kind of liked  With all that rap shit  New York  Well if everybody liked it  How come her version  Wasn't a hit  I don't know  And Sam  When we get back  We're going to talk  A little bit more  About Kanye West  And you cannot defend him  Today sir  I got the performance 
[01:26:30]  If you want to click  I would love to man  He was out there  Just tearing it up  Dark stage  Wasn't it all dull  And fucking depressing  To look at  It was horrible  Yeah  It was like watching  Bonnaroo all over again  Pompous idiot  So we'll finish up  Our coverage  Of the 12-12-12 concert next  Sirius XM  XM  This  Is the  Opinion Anthony Show  All right 
[01:27:00]  Quentin Tarantino  Coming in  In about an hour  45 minutes or so  Yes  Here the movie's great  I  I can't wait  To talk to him  I can't wait  To talk to Quentin Tarantino  Yeah  Oh fuck  He's a goofball too  He's a lot of fun  Yeah  I was so offended 
[01:27:30]  By this film  The language  Oh my goodness  Jimmy  Uses the n-word  A little bit  Dude  It's in the title  Just fucking  It's unbelievable  Did you see  Drudge Report  Front page yesterday  It had a picture  Of Quentin Tarantino  And then it had  The n-word  Written like  Five  Six times  But you know  The i was taken out  Or something  With an asterisk  But they  Like people were like  Wow  This  Sure used this word  A lot in this movie  Like 200 times  It's amazing  That that's noticed  It's like  It's a movie  About slavery  Right 
[01:28:00]  What are you  Going to sugarcoat  The language  Yeah  I think it was used  A few times  Back then huh  Yeah  Well  We'll certainly  Ask him about it  There it is  Oh there it is  That was the page  Yesterday  Oh okay  Alright  So what's that about  I don't know  We want our movies  To be accurate right  Yes  You can't have an accurate movie  And then like  Clean up the language  Because people might be  Offended by it  Yeah that's what it was  That's how  That's how  It's a period piece  People spoke  Back then  And it worked 
[01:28:30]  Yeah you can't look at it  With the sensitivity  Right  Sensibilities of today  Right  So back to the 12-12-12 concert  Oh yeah  So you had  You had drunk uncle  Yeah  Oof  But  Like the drunk fireman  Yeah  Should have  That was funny  Right  Drunk fireman funny  With Steve Buscemi  Yeah  Drunk uncle not funny  Not funny  Should have probably  Just had the drunk  Fucking fireman 
[01:29:00]  Go up on stage  And fool around  For two minutes  Could you imagine  Just tossing them a mic  And saying  Just fill some time  That would have ruled  It would have been  Fucking hilarious  And you know what  We gotta go back  To Mick Jagger  For a minute  I wanna thank  NoFX4us  It doesn't spell out  For it's a number  Should get a little  Credit today  He goes  Everyone's forgetting  Mick Jagger's farewell comment  I thought Mick Jagger  Was a little pissy  Almost like he didn't  Want to be there  And Roland said  Cause I speak Roland 
[01:29:30]  He said  Look it would have  Looked really bad  If the Stones  Didn't do anything  Cause they're in town  That is true  So maybe Mick Jagger  Felt like he was  Sort of  Forced  Forced  Or put in a corner  With this one  Cause it was really strange  I don't care if they  Have a pay-per-view  The Stones  Just doing two songs  When all their peers  Are doing  Right  Yeah a whole set  You know  20-30 minute sets  Yeah  It was so strange  And he kind of  Abruptly left the stage  Like there  There's the two songs  They're right now  I wanna go eat 
[01:30:00]  Wow I didn't notice that  It was almost like  He really didn't  Want to be there  And I guess  Brian said  Mick Jagger's  Farewell comment  Was if it ever  Rains in London  Maybe you could  Help us  Hmm  He did say that  He did say that  Yeah  I thought he was  Just kind of  Kidding around  Like you know  Yeah that was  He was just annoyed  That when we have  Our disasters  Here in America  You know  Everyone comes together  But not so much  When it happens  Somewhere else  And he's just saying  It's like rain  Like hey  If it ever rains  Yeah yeah  Oh wow 
[01:30:30]  That is kind of  Fucked  Do we have that  I didn't even  Think about it  When I heard it  I thought he was  Joking  Yeah but I don't  I mean if Chris Rock  Or somebody said it  You would accept it  Mick Jagger's  Saying that  It comes across like  Whoa  Maybe he didn't  Want to be here  And thinks this is  Ridiculous that  You know  The world helps  America  But then again  We all know  America fucking  Steps up all the  Fucking time  Yeah yeah  A little rain  What was you  Just trying to make  A real statement  That just came out  Stupid  What are they saying  What are they saying  About his exit  What's the headline  No you had the headline 
[01:31:00]  Up there  Sam  It just says  Make a quick exit  Yeah they did  Make a quick exit  Almost like they  Were thinking  Maybe we'll do  A third song  It's a naff  Fuck it  Let's get out of here  Yeah  What are they saying  About the quick exit  It wasn't smooth  It was like  Here's your two songs  And this is our  Obligation  For whoever  Told maybe  Maybe Mick just  Didn't want to do it  At all  But someone said  I heard Harvey Weinstein  Got him to do it  Really  That was what I heard  Was that Harvey  Went backstage 
[01:31:30]  To see  And said to him  Come on  You gotta do this  At a rehearsal  In Brooklyn  At the Barclays  And that was how  They got him  Really  Yeah  Okay  Imagine having  That kind of juice  Just to go watch  The rehearsal  I know  Exactly  He did say  It's wonderful  To be a part of this  And then he said  This has got to be  The largest collection  Of English musicians  Ever assembled  In Madison Square  No aging  Didn't he say  Old English musicians  I think he did  That's the quote in here  Right  But if it rains in London  You gotta come help us  Okay  That could've been a joke 
[01:32:00]  Could've been  I don't think it's a joke  But he could've been annoyed  Nah  I think it's  Yeah  I think that's more  There's more to that  A little annoyed  Kanye West  With his black skirt  Being outrageous  My god  What do you think  Of Kanye West Sam  That's your fucking  Yeah  That's your people  I don't think Kanye West  Had a strong grasp  On the audience  You don't think  He pulled him in  Kanye West  Is a big Kanye West  Fan  Yeah  And I mean  I think that  He feels that 
[01:32:30]  His vision  Is appropriate  For all  But like  I mean he didn't  Like you guys  He just didn't fit  On the show  But it's a bunch  Of middle aged  Fucking white women  That want to like  You know  Sing along to  Living on a prayer  Right  You know what I mean  Exactly  It didn't fit  I said it was like  Putting Nickelback  In the Apollo  Like it just  Didn't fit with  Everything else  Especially because  He came out  And obviously  He insisted on  Doing all this  Because he darkened  The room  And he lit himself  From the back  Which looked terrible  Yeah 
[01:33:00]  It looked terrible  Especially compared  To the vibe  Of the night  Right  Like the night  Like you guys  Were saying  Was very lit up  Yes  You know what I mean  And then when he  Did Mercy  When he came out  That's like a very  Rap  Hip hoppy song  I mean that song  Is new  And hasn't even  Crossed over  To top 40  So to try to convince  Older white people  To listen to that  He was performing  For the 2 billion  Look how dark  This is  No he was  I think he was  Performing for himself  Yeah he wasn't  Performing for MSG  Look at him  Look at all the people 
[01:33:30]  Just  And people just standing  They don't know  What to do  He stunk  And Chris Rock  The lighting was terrible  The Chris Rock  The humble  Kanye West  I think he  Oh yeah  That's how he  Yep  I wish he was less  He wasn't  He was less talented  So because I  He's just a jerk off  The guy's a jerk off  He really is just a jerk off  He's a jerk off  But yeah I mean  He was not  He wasn't even thinking  Of the 2 billion  I don't think  He was performing for him  Really  Just for himself  Yeah I mean he likes  That's why you know  He wears different  Something different 
[01:34:00]  Like if  What's the skirt about  Because he's trying  To do something different  Is he trying to do  Like a Lady Gaga thing  Like well  Have everyone  Well congratulations  We're all talking about  Your dumb black skirt  Your dumb skirt  Right  Well he's always been like  Because when he started  He was the only rapper  That was wearing like  Polo shirts  Which wasn't  So outlandish  It was just different  And so he's just  Continuing to try  To be different  But it becomes difficult  So now he's wearing  Leather pants  And a skirt  So the fucking lighting  Is enragingly terrible  But that's what he does  At his shows  So what 
[01:34:30]  That's what I'm saying  So he wanted to put  On his show  Instead of being  A part of their show  But why do they need him  Exactly  Why  I think the biggest mistake  Was booking him  Of course  Because it's not  It killed the energy  Look at the people  They're not even moving  They don't know  What they're looking at  You put him on early  For two songs  Diamonds are Forever  Is a pretty big song  And there's another one  That the crowd really knew  But even Diamonds are Forever  Wouldn't have  Not for this crowd  What was the second  What did he close with  The crowd actually liked that one  A lot  Really  Yeah his last song  They liked  I was debating 
[01:35:00]  You know  Going to the end  Of this concert  And then  When he came out  I just lost  Took the energy  Out of everything  And then I started thinking  Alright you know what  I've seen enough  To at least talk about it tomorrow  Yep  Honestly  And then  Drunk Uncle followed this  It was like  Okay  It was a double  One man  Punch yeah  And then I'm like  Wait  Maybe Billy Joel  Will bring me back  But I had it at that point  Yeah  Nothing to do with Billy Joel  I just couldn't  Stick around anymore  They probably put him on  Because he screamed racism  At Katrina 
[01:35:30]  Right  Exactly  And so they were like  Wow  You know what  There you go  I mean  That's what flashed in my mind  Because they're like  Look how dark that is  Who's enjoying this  Sam you're talking  Squeaky Wheel  Gets the oil shit  Yeah  Because Jay-Z  If you're going to have a rapper  At this show  It should have been Jay-Z  Jay-Z is the one  He's a New York guy  The Brooklyn thing  And he knows how to  Handle this audience  Jay-Z could handle that audience  He could have been out there  With that Brooklyn Nets hat  Selling some merch  Right  One of these things 
[01:36:00]  Is not like the others  Yeah  He was awful  And he's just  There's something  He is a hateable guy  Kanye West  Because everyone's seen him  Be a jerk off  One too many times  In public  And complain like a little  Fucking baby  One too many times  And he's talented  But you know what  It didn't come through  In this show  No not at all  I  I have a  I have a certain respect  That he  Just completely does  His own thing  But  He doesn't make it  User friendly  No and the thing is  He get way too much time  And I wonder if he demanded that 
[01:36:30]  Like I won't perform  Without this amount of time  Probably  They should have just said  Fuck you  I think that  He probably said  I want 20 minutes  It went way too long  Yeah  Like he probably said  Well what's Bruce getting  35 minutes  I want 20  Really  Jesus Walks is a big song  That's a song  Why wouldn't they just go  You know what  We don't need you  I mean the concert  Was six hours long right  They wanted a rapper  We could have went to bed  20 minutes earlier  Yeah  They wanted a rapper  Exactly  They wanted a rapper  And the people  Why would Jay-Z say no  Because he had to be  The first one they asked 
[01:37:00]  Maybe he couldn't  Is he overseas  He may have been  I think it was probably  Had more to do with  Some kind of tension  Between the Barclays  And the Garden  Oh  Yeah there you go  I think it was political  Sam's thinking  Yeah you're probably right  Because who else  Like you know  Let's be  A bunch of people  Who  A bunch of white people  Are putting this concert on  For  The public at large  So what rapper  Do they know  Kanye West  Like that's the only one  They know  Live rap is not that good 
[01:37:30]  Who would be the top five  That white people  Would like to see rap  You got Jay-Z  Kanye West  If they could get Eminem  Eminem of course  Two others  It's tough right now  We're actively rapping  I mean  People still know  Who P. Diddy is  But he's not doing  Anything new  Doesn't do anything  He's just annoying  He is so fucking annoying  That backlighting  Stinks  Does he do that  For his whole show  I don't know  If he does it 
[01:38:00]  For his whole show  But he obviously  Like that was him  Like he insisted on it  He really wants to be  Like this fucking artist  With the  Yes  It's just so irritating  Because he considers  Himself an artist  And he thinks  Part of his stage show  Is the art  And what he wears  Is the art  And the way the music  Sounds is the art  So this whole thing  Is his art piece  Wow  He looked ridiculous  And he's not like  He wants to be  Considered an artist  But he goes out  With Kim Kardashian  You know how stupid  That is  Yeah it's not exactly  Well maybe it's his muse  He did write a song 
[01:38:30]  Called Perfect Bitch  About her  Something like that  Alright  Let's move through  This finally  So then you got  Michael Stipe  Performing Losing My Religion  With Chris Martin  Where's Travis  He saw this shit  Oh by the way  Well Travis is  Working his way in  One of the funny parts  Also last night  Was when they were  Introducing Tarantino  And Jamie Fox  To come out  And what's his name  The other actor  There  Christoph Waltz  Yes  What during this  Not during  No it was during this  During the  Who was that 
[01:39:00]  The stage show  So we gotta get  Tarantino's take  On this whole thing  Yeah yeah  He was dressed like  Samuel Jackson  For some reason  Really  Yeah everybody was  Saying that  Tarantino  Yeah  He was wearing  The same sweatshirt  He wore here last week  He's a billionaire  But you know  Who introduced them  To come out  Was a recording  Of Leonardo DiCaprio  Right  Because he couldn't  Be there  And he said it  In the tape piece  He goes  I can't be here  I wish I could be there  But I'm filming 
[01:39:30]  Here in Brooklyn  Dude I was  Crack it up  It's like  I can't be here  But I'm  I'm here  At 36th and 8th  And it's really difficult  That's a subway  Yes  Exactly  For 2 billion people  Yes  All he had to do  Was say  It's 12 minutes in a cab  Yeah  But that's how famous  Some of these guys are  Couldn't make it  He could have easily made it  But he's like  You know what  I don't want to be bothered  Yeah  Yeah  He didn't want to be bothered  To be in front of  2 billion people  Yeah I'm stuck  He said I'm stuck  In Brooklyn filming  Yeah you know 
[01:40:00]  You take a couple of  You're Leo  They couldn't switch  The shoot schedule  Right right  What could they possibly  Have had booked  That they absolutely  Couldn't move  Unless it's a location shoot  It's in Brooklyn  But like unless they  Have a street blocked off  That they  I would love to know  The details of that  Yeah  That's funny  Jay-Z wasn't let  Anyone leave Brooklyn  Yeah  He's holding everyone hostage  In Brooklyn  He will not leave this borough  To perform at that concert  Oh my god  And they showed  They're showing it on TV 
[01:40:30]  Right now  That's why I'm bringing up  Governor Christie  Dude he is huge man  When you see him  Like next to other people  When you see him alone  When he's just like  Standing there  Giving a speech  It's one thing  Yeah  But when you see him  Next to other people  As scale  You know  You can tell  How fucking huge he is  He looks like  He walks around  With a hula hoop  Yeah  Yeah  Under his shirt  I don't know what it is  It's like  He is extremely round  And by the way  And he's one of those guys  I believe that  You know  People have a tough time  Keeping the weight off 
[01:41:00]  But then there's other people  Like he's supposed to be thinner  Yeah  He's giant  He's supposed to be  A lot thinner than he is  Because his head's too small  For his body  Yeah  He's got a giant body  It's not like  I've seen fat people  And stuff  But his  He's got  He's got a Jackie Gleason body  Yes  Yeah  Yeah  And he had  Shitty seats  Where was he?  He was way the fuck up  In the back  Well they knew they had to  Give up two seats  They didn't want to give up  Two in front  Two good seats  Two good ones in front 
[01:41:30]  The ones paying  Cuomo was like  Five rows in front of him  Really?  Yeah  They both stood up  They both had shitty seats  If you look at that clip though  You can see Cuomo  Has better seats than him  Because  Oh right  Yeah  I mean Christie's  Taking up a lot of that frame  But  Certainly has  He's huge  He's fucking huge  So Michael Stipe  We were talking about R.E.M. a little bit  This is our music show  We're doing a lot of music today  But  R.E.M. is pretty much retired  They're pretty much done  They're a band that  Tried to survive  And continue  And they just  They just couldn't keep it going 
[01:42:00]  Yeah  They officially broke up last year  Why is that?  They were so  I don't think they were done  They were so huge though  What's-His-Face had that tumor  That like brain tumor  I forget his name  And he went back to the farm  With a drummer  Was it the drummer?  I think so  I think the drummer  And he left  And he never really came back  Is it all this brain tumor gone  Or does he still have it?  I don't know  I think he's okay  He also was just done  Man  You just get to the point  Where you're done  So then they continued on  Without him  And I think they did like  One or two records  A couple albums 
[01:42:30]  Yeah  And they always had  Their like  Their niche  You know  I think it hurt him  That you know  You didn't understand  A lot of the words  In their songs  I think after  And then this asshole  Would go  Well you know  If you think that's  What I'm singing there  Okay  Then that's your  Interpretation  Easy to write  Those songs  That was a big  Monster record  Is that what it was called?  With the orange cover?  In like the  No  Mid to late 90s  The orange cover  Was different than  Monster  Sam why don't you  Pull it up  Come on Sam  For once 
[01:43:00]  Right  I used to be  Interested  And not paying attention  Half the songs  You didn't understand  What he was singing  And he basically said  The lyrics  Yeah  Oh yeah  You're right  Okay  94  I'm sorry  You're right  I think it was all  Downhill after that  That's from 94  That album came out  When we started  Jesus  I got that on BMG  Oh yeah  What's that  It was those like  You know  10 CDs for a penny  Did you rip them off?  Of course I did  You didn't pay off  Your full contract? 
[01:43:30]  I had like  10 different accounts  Oh man  How are they supposed  To stay in business?  It's people like you  And everyone else  But Michael Stipe  Is like  You know  My voice  Is also an instrument  And I don't really care  About the words that much  I just come up with stuff  That sound good  For the song  I think they got too  Like  That's so fucking weird  Too college radio  Like they always were  Right  Like they were a very  College radio band  But then they hit the mainstream  Right  And then I think they went  Back to  To you know  And at that point  No one cared anymore  Yeah  And at that point  So he's retired  He doesn't want to be retired 
[01:44:00]  I would assume he wants to  Maybe he does  Be performing  I think he does like  Art and stuff  He tried the art thing  He's growing a huge beard  I guess  Yeah  How do you sound  With Chris Martin  I didn't hear it  You want to hear it  A little bit  Yeah  Of course  You did Losing My Religion  Yeah  A little taste of this  One singer without a band  So I tried to get  The guy from Gangnam Style  He wasn't available  The guy from Gangnam Style  I had to settle  For another adopted  New Yorker  From Athens, Georgia  Please welcome  Michael Stipe  From R.E.N.  You trying it a little bit 
[01:44:30]  Sweetie  That's the small picture  Wow  Hello New York  This is really happening  Is Chris Martin sing too?  Yeah  He's back  Oh God  I was going with the lounge thing 
[01:45:00]  Yeah  A little acoustical  His voice is a little gruff  He's probably out of practice  I don't know  I've said too much  I set it up  It was Chris Martin  Save him  That's me in the chorus  That's me in the spotlight  Losing my religion 
[01:45:30]  Trying to keep up with you  And I don't know if I can do that  Sounds dangerous  I don't know if I said too much  I hope he's a good painter  I haven't said it now  I thought that I heard you laughing  He looks like Billy Joel wants to look  I thought that I heard you laughing  I think I thought I saw you try 
[01:46:00]  That song  It was okay  That song was massive  He used to have a really good voice  Huge  He had a great voice  I didn't miss anything  Not with that  No  Later on you did  What was after that?  Not really  Yeah  Who was after  What else did Chris Martin do?  One long sounding Coldplay song?  Viva La Vida  I don't know that one either  That's the  You know  Oh do I?  Yeah  That was a monster  How's it go? 
[01:46:30]  For Coldplay  Well E-Rock's writing fan fiction right now  Yeah instead of putting down  Where are you going to put  Like you know  Fucking things you're going to have  Around your hot tub  How about you find the song?  You got that E-Rock?  E-Rock  Coming  He's testing him  E-Rock  You got it  E-Rock  You know this?  Yeah I think so  I just like this song  Yeah  I don't like Coldplay  But I like this song  You don't like Coldplay?  No I never got into the other stuff  I always say I don't like Coldplay 
[01:47:00]  And then every song that they put out  I'm like I really like this song  You don't like the idea of Coldplay?  No I don't  I don't  The idea  Conceptually you don't like them  Yeah  I almost want to hear the whole thing  They're popular aren't they?  A little bit  Very popular  A few girls like them  One married them  What's their most popular song?  Probably Yellow  Yellow I was going to say  Sure  No I wouldn't even  Yellow broke them  But I don't think that's their most popular song 
[01:47:30]  This is probably their most popular  This is probably more popular  Yeah  Yeah but before this  What was their most popular?  They had a string of them  There's Yellow  With The Scientist  Scientist  That whole album was amazing  Clocks  Clocks  Clocks might be their biggest song  Clocks  Clocks  It's huge  Huge  How's Clocks  Uh huh  Oh yeah  It's probably  It's true  Oh yeah  This was huge  Clocks is probably it  Yeah I would say Clocks  Yeah this song is  You like politics?  A little deeper  I don't know if I know that  I love politics  That was just for 10 people out there 
[01:48:00]  This is good  Oh yeah right  Pretty  I acknowledge them as good songs  But I can never just sit down and listen to them  Really?  No  I can't  Why?  I tried  Because I know they're good  I don't think so either  Can't listen to them  No?  No not really  I feel feminine when I listen to them  Very feminine  Psych  I feel like I should be turned on by this guy  No you are turned on by him  And the thought is that it makes you feel feminine  That's the problem  Start questioning her  Really?  Stop avoiding  And just go for it  Oh I don't want to listen to this 
[01:48:30]  Because I'm afraid I might think I should be  Really?  Watching a video  And someone walked in and said  Why is your cock in your hand?  And you're like  Oh I'm acting like a girl  Sam Gary Wright  It's almost 2013  Yeah  Out of the closet  Fucking cocksucker  Give me politics for just a second  I want to know if Travis knows this  We might be going too deep  With this stupid topic now  No Edgar  Fuck it  What else are we going to do?  You have some save yourself  Oh I know  I know this song  Love this song  It's a good song  He used to start his shows with this one 
[01:49:00]  Strings  Oh Jesus Christ  Did you see that?  Yes  We just saw a clip from next year's Walking Dead  Officer Grimes is going to shove something through his head  Christ  Yeah really  We'll get into it eventually  But there was an issue this week  And of course the agent shows up 
[01:49:30]  And it's pretty much fucking  It's over  Just in the nick of time  So now we have to deal with him  And make believe he's important  Oh no  Which I basically told him on the phone  He's actually here to visit Patrice in the hospital  That's how fucking far behind he is  Why is he here?  I don't know  How about three days ago would have been nice  He probably needed an excuse and has another client that he's trying to get  Right  He's got to consolidate his trip  He has somebody for this spot  He's like well you know  I have these guys from Houston  And he ruined politics now  Throw us up for a second  This is one you should download Jim 
[01:50:00]  You tried  The look of utter disgust  That's hilarious  That's how I do it  I know  I'm just  That's a good song  Yeah I know this one  Sure  I love this song  Really love this one  And yeah of course  God put a smile on your face  I make fun of these guys  Because after a while  It sounds like one long  Coldplay song  But  But every time somebody says  What about this song 
[01:50:30]  I know  Then you'll like it  You'll like it  But I think Viva La Vida  Is the only one I can  Like sit down and listen to  Really?  That I would put out in my car  And the song they did with Jay-Z  You piss in your car  They're playing with Jay-Z  You can do anything in your car then  If you're pissing in it  Why is he here?  I have no idea  I didn't tell him to come here  Neither did I  He felt he needed to hop on a jet  And come 3,000 miles  Took the red eye  Obviously  Obviously there was an issue this week  And we'll get into it eventually  We'll get into everything 
[01:51:00]  He had to come here  It'd probably be a good discussion  Because you know  Yeah  We've been out this 18 years  There's going to be  Ups and downs  And all arounds  And  Yeah  It happens  It's happened in the past  It happens to half the bands  You watched last night  Right  Exactly  I remember this radio show  Townsend didn't look too fucking happy  When fucking Daltrey put his arm around him  At the end of the song  That's for sure  Right  He looked at his arm like  Ugh  Right  This is not about anybody coming out of the closet  Mom, dad  Stop with the text 
[01:51:30]  Jimmy  It would be a good discussion  To be honest with you  Yeah  You know  I don't know  Whatever  But Bob's got to be here  Yeah  Just talk to him on the air  He felt  No  No, no, no  Please  Alright  So what else  Let's wrap up this shit  I hear it's going down  To the World Trade Center site  To help clean up  Yeah  I can join Dice  Hi  So then you had the Coldplay thing  And then what happened  Then you got the big  Paul McCartney 
[01:52:00]  The big finale  You know  He kind of blew it  I don't think so  You put Paul McCartney  Near the end of this concert  But they were assuming  It would be  Three and a half  Four hours  Right  I don't think Paul McCartney's happy  That he went on  After one o'clock  Or around one a.m.  Yeah, but he still  When people had to go to work  Over five hours in  Now Paul McCartney comes out  I think the big spot  Was like  Springsteen's spot  Was huge, obviously  The Stones  That didn't give a fuck  About their spot  I mean, Kanye's spot  Was better than  Kanye was way  Way bigger than Paul McCartney's  Saved the best for last 
[01:52:30]  Oh, boy  How did Paul McCartney sound?  Great  He always sounds great  His voice is great  Yeah  Fucking guy  He's one of those guys  That seems like  He hasn't lost it at all  He comes out  And plays Helter Skelter  And it just sounds amazing  Mick Jagger sounds like  He lost it a little bit  Roger Daltry  Not so much  Roger Waters  Like we said earlier  Could sing his songs  For about 30 seconds  30 seconds  And then he has to  Pass it on to somebody else  He's like Turbo Boost  Right  Doesn't last long  No  But I mean  He sounds perfect  For about 30 to 40 seconds  Yep  And then he moves on  Because it gives the lead 
[01:53:00]  To somebody else  Although that  I know David Gilmore  You don't have to tell me  I know this shit  Alright  So let me hear  Paul McCartney  Doing Helter Skelter then  Helter Skelter  I don't know if we have that  Yeah we don't have that  We have his Nirvana thing  And I have the Alicia Keys thing  Oh okay  So there was yesterday morning  Right  The Sun over in the UK  Broke the story  That Paul McCartney  Was going to front  A Nirvana reunion  Well you know where  They got that info from  Can I  Where  E-Rock's twin  E-Rock's twin  Oh E-Rock 
[01:53:30]  There are certain bands  You can never have a reunion with  No that's why I didn't believe this  And that's right  That really pisses me off  Like when the Doors said  They're reunion  You can't without Jim Morrison  Some bands can  Which is why  Everybody immediately starts  Saying  Oh what's he going to sing  There's no possible way  It's just because he's a lefty guitarist  He was going to sing  A Nirvana  No way  Oh you know  Yeah  I didn't know that  I thought he might sing something  I thought he might  Just because I knew  He would have a whole set  I don't think Dave Grohl  And Chris Novoselic  Would do that  Really 
[01:54:00]  Yeah  Even with Paul McCartney  McCartney  Yeah  I think you gotta give  I don't think they would do it  They would  Like just because  It seems silly  But I think  If Paul McCartney wanted to  I think they would  Yeah  Sure  Oh god  There he goes  There he goes down the hall  Holy shit  He has the weakest legs  Oh  That's terrible  Oh my god  Why do they jet out  When he walks like that  He looks like a puppet  He looks like a fucking puppet  You don't see the strings above 
[01:54:30]  That's how he's walking down the hall  Oh  What a misshapen head  He's just awful  Daver  Thank god he's here though  It was yesterday at 1230  I hear there's an issue  I'm like  Oh my god  Are you kidding me  I just talked about  For four hours today alone  I hear there's an issue  I'm like  You know what  Fucking call Steve Blatter  Or any of these other guys  He'll fucking  Get you up to speed 
[01:55:00]  Think Bob's a fool  Yes  I'm gonna hop out of place  He means well  Oh jeez  I gotta get out  I gotta  He means well  There's no need to  Oh problem solved  I don't know what I'm doing  Anyway  Anyway so  Yeah  I mean  To think this was gonna be  Some kind of Nirvana reunion  That drove me nuts  That people like  Went with that angle  It's like  Yeah you really didn't understand  Kurt Cobain  Exactly  If you're thinking that  Kurt Cobain would have been  The famous rolling over 
[01:55:30]  In his grave  If he knew Paul McCartney  Was fronting some kind of reunion  And that's why I think  Dave and Chris wouldn't do it  Right  You know  Well good for them  Yeah  So they  They did a new song  Which they like  Just  Put together  While they were  Through together  Jamming  And it's really good  What  It's really good  How do you know  They just put it together  You sure it wasn't something  Dave Grohl  Was working on for a while  And said  I don't know what to do  It sounds like a very  Dave Grohl song  But how do you  So it very well could be  Like hey I've got this  I mean Dave Grohl  Obviously a huge 
[01:56:00]  Fucking career  Right  But then  But somewhere along the line  He's gotta go to Paul McCartney  I've been working on this thing  I don't know  You wanna try it  Like how do you do that  They've collaborated together before  These two  On like just  You know performances  Nothing like original  Like this though  Right  So  It was really good  Okay  Are you a fan of  You Know You're Right  It's okay  It's the Nirvana song  That came out after he died  They just went through his tapes 
[01:56:30]  And found something  That they could  Make it to a song  It's a great song  Yeah  But it's on  My problem with it  Is that it sounds unfinished  And I think it is unfinished  Because it's the only Nirvana song  That fades out  Right  You know  All Nirvana  Every Nirvana song  You know this song  It's almost a great song  He's right  It's a little too short  Like it  It's like  Kurt  Kurt was obviously working on this  And this would have been a huge hit  It's a Tippy Tom song  Right  Yes  I'd love to hear his  His solo stuff 
[01:57:00]  That he was working on  Yeah  This is definitely  Nirvana  Yeah  It's a good song  It just  Wait for it to kick in  That's some good shit right there 
[01:57:30]  I was listening to  It needed like  The other day  It needed like  One more verse or something  And then it would have been  Just a  That would have been  A great Nirvana song  If he completed it  Yeah  Chris says that he's got  Like tapes of him  Doing solo stuff  That he was working on  Before he died  And they've never been released 
[01:58:00]  Which I'd love to hear  What are you waiting for  Stop it  I don't think he personally has them  But they exist somewhere  That's like  Courtney Love shit  Maybe  Stupid Courtney Love  My daughter hates her  Yeah  How do you  How do you fuck that one up  You idiot  Yeah  The father blows his brains out  You only have your mother left  And she winds up hating her  Right  Yeah well when your mother is Courtney Love  Yeah  I'd rather have nobody  Right  That's basically what you said  Yeah  So I want to hear this 
[01:58:30]  So Paul McCartney  And  It's called Cut Me Some Slack  Alright  Did I  Oh hold on  Did Pat Fominaki  I think  Yeah I did  Okay  You like it  I thought it was alright  But it's just weird  Paul McCartney and Nirvana  I think it's  I like it  It's kind of weird  Pat Fominaki said something like  Kurt Cobain  Was gonna  Kurt Cobain was gonna show up  To the reunion  But he just couldn't get his head together  He's a funny fuck  Fucking Pat  That's hilarious  Why does he need to open mic or something 
[01:59:00]  Oh you should  He's hilarious  It's a shitty situation  But he's got some fucking talent there  He couldn't get his head together  That's funny  Some guys asked me to go and jam with them  Jam with them  Oh here we go  Oh  What happened there  I'm enjoying the performance  You're wrecking everything  Comments  Sam  Did Dave Grohl play some songs with him after this  Or  No 
[01:59:30]  One and done  This is it  One and done  So  You know  The penny finally dropped  I finally understood  That I was in the middle  Of a Nirvana reunion  There's a gentleman  Mr. Dave Grohl  Uh oh  Uh oh  There's another  The other guys  Oh no  Is it Chris  Norvasellich  Oh okay  Norvasellich  Close 
[02:00:00]  Close enough  McCartney  I'm Mr. Pat Smear  We're gonna do the song we jammed now  Pat Smear is a lunatic  I love Pat Smear  First time we've done it live  For you  Here tonight  Oh god  He's just so comfortable  He's cooler than Paul McCartney  You're ready or not  You're ready or not  That's what it sounded like  Until you're done 
[02:00:30]  Da da da da da da  Ha ha ha  Let me breathe  Not many people look cooler playing drums 
[02:01:00]  He's a fucking animal  Holy shit  It just looks cool as fuck 
[02:01:30]  He's such a nice man  Before he sits down  Smiling and waving  Ha ha ha  He beats the shit out of the kid  McCartney shredding the guitar  Oh man  That's awesome  Chris Novostolo  Goes like  Trapper John M.D.  Or No Roberts  Or whatever his name was  It's not bad 
[02:02:00]  It's good  Just for a song  I guess what else would it be?  Ha ha ha  But you know  For a one off thing  A waffle topping  Fair enough  What is McCartney playing?  It's a weird little  Cereal box fucking guitar  Yeah it's a tiny little guitar  That is strange  Short  Do you think McCartney was  Intimidated playing with those guys?  Ha ha ha ha  That's alright I guess  I really like  I've listened to it like  Three times  Oh you like it?  Yeah yeah 
[02:02:30]  I'll search it out later  I'll check it out  It's a little jam like  It's like you know  You could obviously tell  They were in the studio  Just alright  Throw something together  Let's jam  Right  How much fun  To go out and play  Your friend's song  Like I would love  To be able to do that  Yeah  Like have fucking  Have fucking  Chris Rock bring me on stage  And I do like  His fucking  His bit on fucking  Biggie and Tupac  And we laugh together  Comics can't really do that  Can they?  No you don't collaborate  Like that  That's funny  You can't like  Trade lines  No  You might have to go up there 
[02:03:00]  And do a tells  It wouldn't sound right  You know what  But you just came over  To a great concept  For a show  Yeah  To try that  Would be amazing  Guys doing each other's bits  Oh shit  That would be  And that's the name  Of the show  Guys doing each other's bits  That would be  Fucking pretty cool  Comedy jam  And here's Carlos Mencio  Oh you already did it  Yeah  And you can't do  Impressions of each other  You gotta do it  In your own voice  Right  These guys  Make like  Eddie Vedder  May comfortably numb  His vibe  Right  Because he sang it  Like himself  Absolutely made it  His vibe  That would be  Interesting  That was definitely my 
[02:03:30]  I'll say it again  That was my highlight  For sure  Alright  I think that  It was it  Yeah  Pretty cool  Paul McCartney  And then you had  Alicia Keys  Performing Empire State of Mind  At 1.30 in the morning  Are you kidding me?  Mmhmm  1.15  At that point  I had grave regret  That I stayed up  To watch the whole  Fucking thing  What did you think  Was gonna happen?  I don't know  I thought there'd be  A surprise  What's the surprise?  Can you have a surprise?  Fucking Lennon and Harrison?  Their coffins?  Like what the  How do you have a surprise? 
[02:04:00]  I know  If you were following  Eric's Twitter  You'd know that  There were no surprises  That's true  I should have just  Asked E-Rock  He had the entire schedule  Sure  Waiting for a surprise  Yes  E-Rock had this list  Before the hurricane even hit  Which was really amazing  E-Rock  Did you know  Michael Stipe was coming out?  No  That I did not  Oh  Not as inside  As we led to believe  Someone doesn't have  The skinny  In more than one way  Well  Well  Well  Well  Stupid surprise 
[02:04:30]  Oh that was a douchey moment too  When  What's his name  From NBC Nightly News there?  Brian Williams  Went back  And all the Soprano people  Were manning the telephones  And he was just like  Calling them by  Their  Their  Soprano names  By Williams  Hey  He enjoys comedy  Yeah  Oh he certainly does  We're over him though  Right  Hey  Paulie Walnuts  Hey  It was kind of shocking  At first  That a  Straight news man  Would  Right  Explore a little comedy  Sure  But now we're over it 
[02:05:00]  Right  Of course  Okay good  You never saw  You know  Two Jews  Walked into a bar  Would you hear when you talk to Ben Stiller  That fucking Ben Stiller  Is a zero  He is  What a fucking  Zero  He interviewed Ben Stiller  In the phone room  And I mean he has  Ben Stiller just comes with  Zero personality  The only thing of interest  That he said  Was he lives in Westchester  Oh Jesus  Is that the best Chester  The best Chester  That's where fucking  Crashing boars go to live 
[02:05:30]  Apparently  Holy shit  He fucking  Brian Williams comes up  And he's like  Hey Ben Stiller  You're here  Banning the phones  Who's  Who have you been talking to  And he's like  Well  I took a call from Iowa  I  Took a call from Colorado  I took a call from Mississippi  And it wasn't even  He wasn't joking  He was  He is just  Unless he's like  Reading a script  Or  In a movie  Or something  We had him on 
[02:06:00]  He is  Fucking  Dollsville  I should have  Manned the phones  They asked me to do it  And I did not  Yeah  I said I don't man phones  I either close the show  Or I don't go  That's right  You could have been  The surprise  Yes  My big surprise  I would have been like  Jimmy  Yeah  I'm so glad I stayed up  How we doing  You think that would have been  A tough spot  And they announced you  As the big surprise  After one day  I would have changed my name  To the exit kid  Everybody was walking out 
[02:06:30]  And I'm bombing  Ladies and gentlemen  Jim Norton  What are you  Travis Meeks  In Philadelphia  Would it be terrible  Oh god right  Did I be chanting  For drunk uncle  After two minutes  You want to talk about  A guy that couldn't  Read a room  Oh god  And we loved the guy  And I still think  He's got a great voice  Travis Meeks  Was closing one of our  Road shows in Philly  And we had  We gave him like  Two hours of just  Ridiculous shit  Tits and ass  And all sorts of  Debauchery  Craziness  And then we're like  Alright here's  I think 
[02:07:00]  Was it Travis Meeks  By himself  Or was it  Days of the New  No it was just  Travis Meeks  Solo  But he had like  Musicians with him  And he was going to do  All the Days of the New  Yeah yeah yeah  And he decided  To completely lose the room  Because he had to  Light all his candles  Personally on the stage  And he didn't do anything  For about 10 or 15 minutes  And like you just said  The only reason I bring it up  That everyone just started  Fucking leaving  They were like  You know  Fuck you  They thought it was over  Yeah  He needed to get  Right into it  Right away  That would have  Held them there  But no 
[02:07:30]  Oh is this  Ben Stiller  Oh is this  Ben Stiller's  Great appearance  Yeah  Yeah let's hear  A little of this  Everyone has a story  I'm a Jersey Shore kid  You're a New Yorker  Everyone has a New York story  About how they were  Affected by this story  Yeah we live in  Westchester  And we were without power  For about  Nine days  And no phones  And internet  But we were really lucky  I mean a few trees  Went down  But when you hear  The stories of people  In Staten Island  And Jersey  And the difference  Of the experience  From different parts  Of the city 
[02:08:00]  You know  My folks are  On the Upper West Side  And nothing is affected  Right  And people's lives  Were turned upside down  And just a few miles away  So  I know there's Christmas  Shopping going on  Midtown Man  He just  That monotone  He wasn't affected  By the storm  Why don't you  Do something  He's boring  Ben Stiller wants  Everyone to think  That he was in the dark  For nine days  He wasn't  How did he come  From his father  I know  He wasn't in the dark  For nine days  No  Don't make it about you 
[02:08:30]  If Brian Williams  Said hey  Am I in the circle  Of trust  Ben Stiller  Got his  Family together  And he went  Went somewhere  With lights  Oh yeah  I don't think  He was with that  Maybe your house  Didn't have  Fucking lectures  Right  But you didn't  Sit there  In the dark  For nine days  Like everyone else  Had to  Because they  Didn't have  The means  To get  Into a hotel  Or somewhere else  You don't think  Ben Stiller  Sat in a line  To get gas  For his generators  Oh yeah  Why did he have  To try to make it  About himself  He was probably 
[02:09:00]  In LA  He probably said  You know what  Fuck it  I'll go to my  LA house  For nine days  Until I get  This shit figured out  I could have  To sit here  In a dark house  In Westchester  It's stupid  In Westchester  He hired a private  Plane to take him  Exactly  Right  He was not  Affected at all  Right out of  Westchester airport  There's one right there  Should we play  Alicia Keys  Or are we done  Is it a good performance  New York  How about we play  A little bit  Going into a break  When we get back  Quentin Tarantino  Will be joining  The program 
[02:09:30]  Who has it  I do  You got it  Alright  This is how the show  Wrapped up for the people  That just could not  Stay up anymore  Poor Paul McCartney  Was on stage  With a bunch of  Drunks and  People  And they were  Hassling him  Taking pictures  Were they  Yeah  That's what I would have done  That's true  And girls  Yes  Still doing it though  Is he signing something  Oh he's being a nice guy  Just taking pictures  You can't say no  In front of two billion people 
[02:10:00]  That's a little rough  To be a scumbag  Get the fuck away from me  Yeah you couldn't  Dude  You fire putting out  You couldn't  I'm pro fire  Glennon's been dead  For 32 years  And there's McCartney  Sounding exactly  The same style  Oh my god  Amazing right  Where is this bitch  Makes a big entrance  Back to the piano  They all know each other  They all respect each other  That's a fun world  Her custom square ass  That fits her custom  Piano stool 
[02:10:30]  You know that you're in New York  Why ask  The answer is yes  It was so annoying  When she was saying  Say it with me  New York  New York  New York  And she said it like  A thousand times  I liked her cell phone song  Oh god  That's gonna be a hit  I wish Jay-Z had been the surprise  Do you  You'd come out and do this song with her 
[02:11:00]  You would've  That would be New York  Would you have been glad  When you stayed up  If that was a surprise  No  I was in a cab  When Jay-Z started singing  With Pearl Jam  Oh that's right  I don't need a surprise  At the end of my shows  What if Big Owen Dukes  Was a surprise  Ah that would've been cool too  I was waiting for some kind of surprise  This was it  Derek Jeter's fucking music  That's it  That's what I got as a surprise  See what happens 
[02:11:30]  When it's just a hook  It's not as fun  Look at Paul McCartney  And like people taking pictures  With him  Drunks are waving their arms  On stage  Looking silly  Look at that big fireman  Goof waving his arms  How silly does he look  I'd love to be  I would be annoying  Everyone up there  Like while the show  Holding my camera out  I'd be sneaking in and out of them  There were people doing that  Hold their cameras in front of them  With Paul McCartney  You're like  It's McCartney  They have to  I love this part of that song 
[02:12:00]  She sounds good  Doesn't I  It's better with Jay-Z  Fine  It is  It's a great rap song  She sounds good man  She sounds awesome  She should win an award someday  I wish you break  Because Quentin's going to be here soon  I have to tinkle  He's on his way  He's on his way up already?  No  He's on his way here  Oh alright  That plays out a little bit  Alright  She walls  Such a melting pot 
[02:12:30]  On the corner  Selling rock  Preaches  Pray to God  Here the gypsy cat  Takes me down  From Harlem  To the Brooklyn  Bridge  Someone sleeps tonight  With a hunk of more  Than an empty  Bridge  I'm gonna make it by any means 
[02:13:00]  I got a pocket full of dreams  Baby I'm gonna be  New York  New York  Long tree jungle  Where dreams are made of  There's nothing you can't do  Now you're in New York  These streets will make you feel brand new  Big lights will inspire you  Here it's a New York  New York  New York 
[02:13:30]  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  This is the  Opinion Anthony Show  What's this?  What's this?  Why this one, Iraq?  It's from Reservoir Dogs  Oh  Alright  Wait, is it?  Yeah  Yeah, this is the beginning  We're walking down the sidewalk  On the street 
[02:14:00]  Yeah  Where is he?  Is he on his way up?  Spencer said he was on his way up  But then Roland said he's in traffic  Did you talk to Nosferatu out there?  Oh, gosh  Figured I'd get on a plane  Oh  Good  Really?  How about you get on another one?  Yeah, exactly  I wish he said that when the big bopper was taking a flight  I'm so glad  I paid him a shitload of money  So I could, like, take care of my problems by myself 
[02:14:30]  Thank you  Where do I sign up for that one?  You think he's a day late and a dollar short?  Oh, my God  I figured I'd get on a plane  Really?  I gotta go pick up my kid after the show  I think  Quentin's gonna sign him thinking it's a Dusk Till Dawn prop  Oh, here he comes  Fuck yeah  Oh, yeah  Quentin Tarantino's guy  Making his way  Making his way  What was the death movie again?  Death  Death Proof  Death Proof  Death Car 
[02:15:00]  Death Car  Death Proof  There he is  Usher Quentin Tarantino right in  Right in  Tarantino  Fuck yeah  How you doing, man?  That's right  Good to see you, buddy  Pleasure  How you been?  Good  How do you guys know each other?  Well, I don't really know  I didn't know of him  I've seen his specials on HBO  Son of a bitch  And we did Leno together once  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true  Oh, you did?  Yeah, you know  There's just a couple of guys who enjoy each other's work  A couple of big stars  Similar ilk  Yeah, another similar ilk  We just hate when people recognize him 
[02:15:30]  We really don't like that at all  It goes to his head  Yeah, yeah  Well, I remember you on the Louis C.K. show  That was on Showtime, I think  HBO, yeah  Yeah, and I had never seen you before  When I saw you on that  And then I just happened to be  Turning the dial  I don't know about  Eight months later  And I saw your stand-  I came in the middle of your stand-up special  And I pissed my pants  That was so funny  Thank you, man  Thanks  Oh, God damn it  I'm very happy  You know about your Golden Globes?  I just literally on the drive here  About three blocks ago 
[02:16:00]  Just found out about that  Damn, I thought I was going to break it to you  Nominated for five Golden Globes  Quentin Tarantino  Wow, that's fucking great  Yeah, it's pretty cool  It's pretty cool  Yeah  Yeah, I guess  It was one of the  Harvey Weinstein was saying  He was saying, okay  The turning point's going to be tomorrow  We'll see  We'll be in the game in a big way  Come tomorrow  You know  And  You want that  But you're also trying to manage expectations  Sure, sure  So you're totally bummed out  When it doesn't happen  But this sounds like a pretty good year 
[02:16:30]  Is that  Yeah  And that stuff is still exciting to you?  Oh, it's totally exciting  Well, I worked real hard on film and everything  And actually  It's actually kind of fun to go to  It's fun to go to the Oscars  It's fun to go to the Golden Globes  And have a good time with your colleagues  Yeah  And to know that you're one of the guys  That they're all focused on  It's got to be a little bit bummy  If you're like  There's no mention of you whatsoever  But when you're one of the guys  It's got to be even better  Oh, yeah  I mean, you know  You have to keep perspective on it  I mean, some of my favorite movies  Have never been nominated or won anything  Yeah, yeah  Good and the Bad and the Ugly wasn't there 
[02:17:00]  At the Golden Globes  And wasn't there at the Academy Awards  I think it's the best movie ever made  Wild Bunch wasn't there at the Oscars  You know, so you've got to keep it in perspective  Yeah, yeah  Wait, the Good and the Bad and the Ugly  Didn't win anything for  Nah, it was considered Italian junk  Yeah, just a dumb little spaghetti western  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It didn't become a classic until later  Yeah, that is an amazing movie, too  It's my favorite movie of all time  It really is, huh?  This reminded me of a Sergio Leone vibe, too  I saw a Django last night  And the way it was filmed 
[02:17:30]  Like the colors of the film  Absolutely  And the head-on shots  Although there's a lot more blood in yours  Than there was in his  Well, you like the blood there  Yeah, but in particularly, though  I was going off of a spaghetti western vibe  Of doing my western  That's probably my favorite sub-genre  In all the cinema is spaghetti westerns  I'm a big fan of them  And so I knew when I did my western  I would want it to have that kind of vibe  That kind of operatic music  And that whole larger-than-life aspect of it all  Yeah  Is it rough to go from genre to genre? 
[02:18:00]  You've done that  I mean  And very successfully  Crime movies  Horror  You've done pretty much it all  Do you have to really take a lot of time  To adjust what you're doing?  Well, I think  Hmm  Hmm  Not really  I guess the adjustment happens  During the writing of the script  Oh, okay  I mean, it might be actually a little different  If I was going out there  And just reading scripts  And finding  Oh, hey  Here's a good western I could do  Here's a good detective movie I could do  I mean, that might be a little different 
[02:18:30]  Or  The process would start then  But no  The process starts with  Like, literally  The blank piece of paper  Uh-huh  You know  And me filling out 170 pages  All right  And having a script  So it all just comes down to the story  Right, right  Do you write longhand still?  Absolutely  You do?  Why?  Can't write poetry on the computer, man  Wow  You could  Really?  You could think better  If you just  Have the pen in your hand  No, that's exactly  Well, that's how I've always done it  And it's, you know  I've kind of  I don't even know if I believe in God  But I do feel that, you know 
[02:19:00]  My pen is my intended to God  As far as writing is concerned  But, you know  Actually  The process  The way the process has kind of evolved, though  Is  I actually  Ignored this  This part of the process  For about  For like the middle point of my career  And got back to it  On Inglourious Basterds  And now I'm like  How could I have ever stopped doing this?  Was  When I wrote Reservoir Dogs  I wrote it out  Normally when I'd written something before  I couldn't type  I would talk friends into typing things up for me  Well, I used my last friend 
[02:19:30]  As far as that was concerned  Enough of this  Enough of this typing shit  All right  I'll drive you to the airport  I'll help you move  But fuck typing your shit  And  Fair enough  So  In that case  I wrote Reservoir Dogs longhand  And I had to type it up  And  I couldn't type  And I didn't even have a typewriter  I borrowed my girlfriend at the time  Her little  Smith Corona  Wow  Word processor  From 1987  Her Smith Corona  Word processor  Slash typewriter  With a little floppy disk 
[02:20:00]  With a memory of 30 pages on it  It's doing for kids  College kids doing papers  And so I borrowed it  And I just typed it up  One finger at a time  And that's kind of  And that's how I did Pulp Fiction  And  I kind of got away from that  And I went back to it again  In  In Glorious Bastards  Again  Actually  Using  Her Smith Corona  Word processor  All right  I'm kind of superstitious about that  Also it's idiot proof  I can't fuck it up  That's true  Yeah  But you know  Literally  The whole process of me 
[02:20:30]  Writing by hand  When I now have to type it up  By one finger  And just literally  I don't trust it to hold anything  From memory  So I print up every page  As I finish  Oh wow  But you know  It's  That's an important part  Of the process to me  That's like the  You know  That's the final draft  Coming out  There  I mean  Because I do tend to  I think people do  You tend to overwrite  When you're writing by hand  Because it's just  Costs you nothing  It's just blah blah blah  Blah blah with the pen  But when you gotta type it up 
[02:21:00]  With one finger  If this shit ain't  Motherfucking Shakespeare  It's got to go  I never thought of it like  Yeah yeah  It better be important  It better be good  Typing stinks  That's the worst  Wow  Did you write the script  And then pitch to Harvey Weinstein  Or did he say  I want you to write something about this  Or did you say  I'm thinking about something with slavery  Or how did that happen with him  No I never do a pitch kind of thing  I  The only reason you do pitches 
[02:21:30]  Is if you're  Like  Want to be paid  For writing your script  I don't want to be paid  For writing my script  I want people to buy my script  I want to  You know  We're going to make this movie  When I'm done  So I want to own it  Up until the financing is concerned  So I always write it on spec  I always just write it myself  It's mine  And so then I don't have to explain it  I don't have to sell anybody on it  I give them the script  They either like it or they don't  And the movie is right there  Right  So you read it  What you see is what you get  Yeah  And you're getting a lot of flack  Is like the drudge report  Because the word nigger  Was used a lot 
[02:22:00]  And my take on it  Was it was used a lot  But it almost felt like  In this day and age  It's such a shocking word  That you desensitized people to it  Which kind of fits that time  Like that is how it was used  In that time  If you  If 15 years from now  They create a  You don't want to hear the N word  In 15 years from now  If they create time travel  Don't go back to the Antebellum South  It's kind of a fucked up time  And if you don't think 
[02:22:30]  It was used  As much  If not more  You know  And that actually kind of  Really is my answer  To the question  Is like what  Do you think that I  Overused it  Compared to how it was used  In the Antebellum South  If not  Shut up  You showed how  I think it was brilliant  Good for you by the way  You showed how comfortably  People you  Because like to hear people  Saying that type of stuff  With black people at the table  It's jarring  But that's  That's how it was  Well yeah  I mean you know  Like you know  You've got  You've got that whole  Upstairs downstairs  Situation going on 
[02:23:00]  With the house servants  And then the people  And the people  Who own the plantation  And you have like  Kind of like  The sort of like  Honor guards  They're standing behind  Every guest  Waiting to  You know  Those three girls  That are behind  The diners  And they're furniture  They're not people  They are furniture  They were referred to  As furniture  They're not supposed  To do anything  They're not supposed  To make any living things  It's just  If somebody needs salt  They give salt  Take the plate away  Pour more wine 
[02:23:30]  Just supposed to be furniture  Yeah it was  It was really amazing  When you show  Because you would get  Like a huge laugh  In the scene  I was amazed  That you got laughs  Addressing slavery  And then the next moment  It jumps to a  Tremendously sad moment  I think emotionally  This  I cried watching this movie  It's by far  The most emotionally  Amazing thing you've done  Oh thank you  I couldn't believe  How many different places  You took me with it  Well I really  I really like  Orchestrating  Kind of  Orchestrating the audience's 
[02:24:00]  Feelings  And their emotions  Like I kind of  Almost feel like  If I'm doing my job  To the fullest  Of my ability  I should be  Like  A  A  A  A  A  A  A conductor  Conductor  Thank you  I almost said  Painter  I should be  Like a symphony  Conductor  And the audience's  Reactions  Are my orchestra  Wow yeah  And I mean  You know  And now  That's a heavy  That's a heavy 
[02:24:30]  Duty thing  To want to try to do  And then when I  Get no response  You know  At certain screenings  I know I have  Completely failed  Wow  You know  Because I  Oh there should  Be a laugh here  Or there should  Be a this  But you know  To me really  Part of the thrill  Is to just  Be mixing those  Emotions  And taking you  Up and down  Especially trying  To do it  With comedy  Where it's  Like laugh  Laugh  Laugh  Stop laughing  Stop laughing  Horror  Spence  Laugh  Yeah  That's gotta be  Very difficult  To do 
[02:25:00]  When you're  When you're  Writing  So  Because you  Can't just  Go from  Certain things  Into laughing  I mean  There's  Last night  At the  12-12-12 concert  There was a  Prime example  Of a complete  Fuck up  As far as  That's concerned  They went  From a  Filmed piece  About some  Horrific  You know  Destruction  And people  Losing their  Houses  And some  Woman is  Literally  Screaming  And going  And we  Lost  Everything  And it  Stopped  Dead  And then the  Announce  It goes  Ladies and  Gentlemen  Chris Rock  And it  Was like  I felt the 
[02:25:30]  Exact same  I was like  This poor  Bastard  You know  He's thinking  Thanks  And Chris  Is standing  Like what  The fuck  Did you do  To me  What did  I do  To you  Yeah  So there's  Gotta be  Some kind  Of you know  Kind of  Leading  Into  Where you're  Going  Yeah  Yeah  Bridget  Right  Yeah  You've always  Done that  Very well  And getting  Laughs  Out of  Things that  Are like 
[02:26:00]  Horrific  At the  Moment  The prime  Example  Of course  You've heard  A thousand  Times  In Reservoir  Dogs  The ear  Yeah  Yeah  I mean  The guy  Gets his  Ear cut off  A horrific  Scene  And then  When  Michael  Madsen  Starts to  Hello  Can you  Hear  He's  Talking  Into  The ear  You can't  Help but  Laugh  As you're  Fucking  Horrified  Right  You know  And since  He's  Was last  Here  We've met  Michael  Madsen  Yeah  He's nuts  Right  Did you  Always know  That he was  Nuts  We love him  By the way  He's a  Very honest  Man  He's gotten 
[02:26:30]  A little  More nuts  I say that  With nothing  But love  And affection  He had to  Tone it down  To play  Mr. Blue  One of our  Favorite moments  On the show  He came in  And then he  Went through  All his movies  That he's  Done recently  And explained  Why he did  Each movie  And it was  Brutal  I owe  Child support  This was for  A mortgage  This was  I owed  I don't know  I would love  If you guys  Can yank that  Out of the  Files for me  I would love  To hear  That sounds  Really funny  Michael going 
[02:27:00]  Through his  Straight to  Video  Filography  Would be  Hysterical  He didn't  Hold back  At all  Man  It was the  First time  Someone finally  Admitted that  They actually  Do movies  Because they  Owe a little  Money  And they're  Like alright  Fuck it  I gotta do  This one  He's a  Great guy  And he's  No we love  him  Don't confuse  The vibe  Not at all  When we know  He's coming in  We get very  Excited  It's obvious  You guys have  Appreciation  He's a great  Actor  Growing up  Obviously you  Must have seen 
[02:27:30]  The Blaxploitation  Movies  Who was in  Those  He played  In  Rudy Ray  Moore did a  Bunch of those  Ghost of  Nigger Charlie  Was one of them  Fred Williamson  Yes  Fred Williamson  No it's called  The Legend of  Nigger Charlie  Legend  Right right  Yeah yeah  Did they make  A couple of  Those  They made  Two of them  The Legend of  Nigger Charlie  And Soul of  Nigger Charlie  Soul right  Right right  Well The Legend of  Nigger Charlie  Was really  Kind of important  It's  It's  It's  Not a  It's  It's  It's 
[02:28:00]  Not a bad movie  It's hampered  By the fact  That it has  Almost no budget  Whatsoever  Right  But I mean  It was still  Released by Paramount  I think the  Paramount logo  Cost more  Than the movie  But but it  Was unique  And pretty much  Unique up until  The time that  This movie was  Made  It's the only  Movie that  Shows us  That that  Deplicts a  Slave narrative  Where a slave  Gets a gun  Kills you know  Kills overseers  And and you  Know leads a  Western style  Revolt  Right  Not a Nat 
[02:28:30]  Turner turn over  The plantation  Kind of revolt  But you know  They take over  A town and  Fight a bunch  Of ragtag  Confederates  Right yeah  That that kind  Of reminds me  Of what you've  Done  Yeah it's  Well it was  Funny because  You know there  Was a little  Tiny bit of  That just even  In my thought  Process when I  Wrote this film  Because I remember  One of the  Producers of my  Movie is  Reginald Hudlin  Who is a  Director who  Directed House  Party  Boomerang  And we were  Talking about  Another movie  That dealt with 
[02:29:00]  Slavery and he  Was talking about  How he didn't  Care for it  He said movie  Made with the  Best intentions  In the world  But ultimately  It's unsatisfying  And he was  Giving the reasons  Why he thought  It was unsatisfying  And he goes  Look even though  This movie was  Made with the  Best intentions  In the world  As far as  Black folks are  Concerned  The legend  Of Nigger Charlie  Is far more  Empowering  Can I guess  That the movie  Was Amistad  And the reason  He didn't like it  Was because it  Focused too much  On the white  Heroes  Yeah that was it  Wow  Look at Jimmy  Norton  Jimmy  I can't think of  Any other  Modern day 
[02:29:30]  Slavery movies  Check out the  Big brain  On Jim  Very good  I was amazed  That the  Slavery was  Addressed so  Like you  You didn't  Trivialize it  Like even  Though there  Was big laughs  And I mean  Funny  With fucking  Harsh language  That when you  Went to one  Of those  Horrifying  There's a  Hot box  Scene  Which I  Didn't even  Know existed  Back then  It is  It's horrifying  And it's  Gut wrenching  But it doesn't  Feel manipulative  It doesn't 
[02:30:00]  Feel like  You're trying  To make  People cry  It really  Feels like  You're giving  An honest  Picture  Oh yeah  Well I mean  You know  And that  Sequence  Because you  Know who's  In the  Hot box  Is Django's  Woman who  He's going  To going  To rescue  Played by  Kerry Washington  Broomhilda  And you  Know there  Is kind of  A two  Thing  Situations  Going on  He's gone  To the  Pit of  Hell  To extract  Her  From this  Place in  Mississippi  Where like  As far as I'm  concerned  All of  Antebellum  South is  Hell but  Mississippi  Is the  Asshole  Of hell  And he 
[02:30:30]  Goes down  There and  And when  He sees  That she's  In the  Hot box  Shit is  Even worse  Than he  Thought it  Was but  At the same  Time it  Also tells  The audience  She's in  The hot box  Because she  Tried to  Escape  She's tried  To get  Out of  Here  She can't  Right  Right  Oh man  Yeah it  Was just  Really chilling  And brutal  And I  Love the  Fact that  The laughs  Would come  After there  Was an  Immediately  Sad scene 
[02:31:00]  And I  Can't  Understand as  A writer  How you  Take that  Risk  I know  You've  Addressed  That already  But like  What balls  To put  Like the  Don Johnson  Is big  Daddy  Some of  The lines  He had  Coming from  The top  Of the  Steps  Got laughs  Yeah  Right  Holy shit  It's kind  Of funny  All right  When he's  When he's  Addressing  The slave  Girl  To show  Janko  Around the  Ground  The house  And  And  And  He has  To remind  Her that  Janko  Isn't a 
[02:31:30]  Slave  That he's  A free  Man  But she  Doesn't  Quite  Understand  The concept  All right  So he's  Trying to  Explain it  To her  And she  Goes  What you  Mean you  Want us  To treat him  Like why  Folks  No  No  That's  Not  What I  Said  I got  A huge  Laugh  What a  Great line  Hilarious  Oh my god  Is that  Difficult  For an  Actor  To  You know  Spew out  Horrid  Racial  Epithets  And  Even  Though  You're  Acting  But  There's 
[02:32:00]  Such  Sensitivity  In this  Day and  Age  With  Race  To stand  There  Right  In front  Of  Somebody  That's  Black  And  To be  Just  Blurting  Out  Racial  Epithets  Is that  Difficult  As an  Actor  Well  I guess  If it  Was  Difficult  For  Them  I  Probably  Wouldn't  Have  Cast  Them  I  Mean  I  Mean  We  All  We're  All  Doing  A  Job  We  All  Know  We're  There  Everybody  Has  Read  The  Script  Sidney  Poitier  Used  To  Actually  Talk  About  That  His  First  Big  Movie  Was  No  Way  Out  With  Richard  Widmark  And  In  That  Movie  Richard  Widmark  Just  Says  The  Most  Vile 
[02:32:30]  Stuff  To  Him  And  Richard  Widmark  Was  One of  The  Biggest  Liberals  Of  The  50s  And  He  Proved  It  By  Constantly  Starring  In  Movies  With  Sidney  Poitier  But  In  That  Film  He  Would  Say  Everything  And  There  Would  Be  A  Cut  I'm  Sorry  Sidney  Oh  Really  And  Sidney  Poitier  I  Read  The  Script  I  Read  I  Didn't  Just  Show  Off  And  We  Were  Just  Freestyling  I  Read  The  Script  At  Craft  Services  Just 
[02:33:00]  Thought  I'd  Throw  It  In  Yeah  But  You  Know  It's  Like  If  You  Would  Be  The  Wrong  Person  To  Play  The  Role  If  You  Are  That  Self  Conscious  About  It  Your  Job  Isn't  To  Apologize  To  The  People  Around  You  Your  Job  Is  To  Be  That  Guy  Yeah  And  To  Channel  Him  And  And  Be  His  Spokesperson  Good  Or  Bad  That's  Got  To  Be  An  Actor's  Mind  Because  It  Just  Seems  Like  It  It's  Such  A  Sensitive  Issue  That  It  Would  Just  Feel  Odd  To  Do  That  Well  Here's  The  Thing  Though 
[02:33:30]  It's  Like  It's  One  Thing  To  Do  It  Opposite  The  Other  Actors  In  The  Film  And  Everything  Like  I  Said  We  We've  Gone  Through  Rehearsal  We  All  Know  What  We're  Doing  But  To  Keep  That  Mindset  Of  Your  Character  I  Don't  Talk  About  Some  Like  You  Know  I'm  In  Character  All  The  Time  You  Have  To  Talk  To  Me  Like  This  Way  That  Way  I'm  Talking  About  That  But  Just  You  You're  Not  Trying  To  Break  Out  Of  The  Mindset  You're  Trying  To  Keep  In  The  Mindset  We  Have  A  Whole  Bunch  Of  Black  Crew  Members 
[02:34:00]  To  Actually  Not  Apologize  For  Your  Character  Because  It's  Not  Your  Job  To  Apologize  For  Your  Character  To  Not  Apologize  For  Your  Character  And  Just  Kind  Of  Keep  The  Course  There  Even  With  Everyone  Around  You  That  Takes  A lot  Of  Integrity  And  It  Takes  A lot  Of  Artistic  Focus  Can  I  Tell  You  Who  Was  Brilliant  And  I  Fell  In love  With  Him  Again  And  He  Was  Repulsive  DiCaprio  Plays  A  Repulsive  Guard  I  Couldn't  Believe  The  Way  He  It  Just  He  Is  Leo  DiCaprio 
[02:34:30]  Talking  To  These  Actors  In  This  Scene  Like  That  With  Such  Like  You  Said  Like  They  Were  Pieces  Of  Furniture  And  I  Know  He  An  Actor  But  It  Was  Still  Shocking  To  See  Him  Do  It  That  Well  No  He  Had  Just  An  Incredible  Amount  To  Play  A  Villain  That  Doesn't  Mean  The  Guy  Wasn't  A  Bad  Guy  He  Just  Not  Going  To  Be  I  Not  Here  To 
[02:35:00]  Just  Serve  The  Function  In  The  Movie  Of  Playing  The  Bad  Guy  I  I  I'm  Going  To  Give  You  Who  This  Guy  Is  And  Then  Everyone  Else  Can  Make  Up  Their  Mind  But  I  Have  To  Be  True  To  This  Guy  And  His  Incredible  Amount  Black  And  Christoph  Walt  Says  I  Don't  Know  How  To  Play  This  Guy  Dirty  Or  Play  Him  How 
[02:35:30]  You  Think  He  Should  Play  He's  Like  They're  Horrible  That's  The  Worst  Well  Then  Do  That  Give  Me  That  Guy  Give  Me  The  Worst  Guy  You've  Ever  Met  Okay  I  Can  Do  That  You  Get  Great  Performances  From  These  Actors  Why  Is  That  You  Think  Well  It  Really  Stands  Out  In  A Lot  Of  Your  Movies  Obviously  Well  You  Know  Kind  Of  I  Think  It's  A  Three  Prong  Thing  You  Know  I  Write  Good  Characters  I  Write  Interesting  Characters  I  Then  I  Cast  Them  Well  I  Cast  Them  Well  And  The  Part  Of 
[02:36:00]  Casting  Well  Is  Usually  Unless  I'm  Writing  It  For  Somebody  In  Particular  Sometimes  That  Works  Out  And  Sometimes  It  Doesn't  It's  About  The  Character  First  It's  Not  The  Actor  First  I  Don't  Have  An  Obligation  To  Give  A  Groovy  Actor  A  Role  I  Have  An  Obligation  To  Find  The  Best  Person  To  Play  My  Character  They're  My  Characters  They  Came  From  Deep  In  My  DNA  And  I  Want  Them  To  Have  The  Perfect  Person  To  Play  Them  I'm  Not  Writing  Theater  Where  Everybody  For  The  Next  20  Years  Gets  A  Crack  At  It 
[02:36:30]  This  Is  It  I  Think  What  You're  Saying  There  Is  Other  Directors  Break  Down  And  They  Go  With  The  Groovy  Guy  It's  Kind  Of  Easy  To  Do  It's  Almost  The  Whole  Industry  Seems  To  Be  Heading  That  Way  Usually  The  Groovy  Guy  Is  Groovy  For  A  Reason  All  Well  And  Good  But  If  You  Really  Want  It  To  Be  Magical  Like  Say  Christoph  Waltz  As  Londa  Then  It's  Got  To  Be  I'm  Looking  For  The  Right  Guy  And  Only  The  Right  Guy  Will  Do  And  Then  You  Just  Add to  The  Fact 
[02:37:00]  That  You  Know  I  Know  How  To  Deal  With  Actors  I  For  Lack  Of  A  Better  Word  I  Speak  Actor  Talk  So  I  Believable  Even  Though  It  Seemed  Like  These  Crazy  Things  Put  Together  Well  There  Is  Kind of 
[02:37:30]  One  Of  The  Tricks  Of  The  Film  Is  The  Movie  Really  Is  It's  The  Most  Linear  Of  All  My  My  Stories  I  Don't  Kind of  Hop  Around  I  Don't  Do  The  Separate  Chapter  Thing  Where  I'm  Trying  To  Hitting  It  From  Different  Different  Points  Of  View  Or  Try  To  Bring  Other  Characters  And  Everything  Converges  Later  Or  F-ing  With  The  Time  Scheme  This  Was  A  Journey  You  Have  To  Follow  Django  From  Page  1  To  Page  170  And  Really  Go  On  That  Journey  If  It's  Going  To  Work  But  One  Of  The  Things  About 
[02:38:00]  That  Journey  Is  The  First  Hour  Is  Kind of  Fun  All  Right  The  First  Hour  It's  Kind  Of  Like  A  Butch  And  Sundance  Kind  Of  Teamwork  That's  Going  On  And  Then  That's  When  You  But  Then  After  That's  Over  And  You  Know  Django's  Got  His  Bonafides  So  To  Speak  Now  He's  Ready  To  Go  Into  The  Hell  Of  Mississippi  To  Extract  His  Woman  And  That's  When  Things  Starts  Getting  Tough  And  What  Did  You  You  Talk  About  Casting  Actors  Don  Johnson  What  What  An  Odd  Choice  Like  What  What  Was  It  That  He  Had  In  The  Past  That  You  Go  This  Guy  Is  Perfect  To  Play  This  Horrible 
[02:38:30]  Slave  Master  Oh  See  I've  Always  Been  A  Big  Fan  Of  Don  Johnson  I  Mean  Like  Ten  Years  Before  Miami  Vice  When  I  Johnson  He  Did  A  Really  Great  Car 
[02:39:00]  Movie  In  The  70s  Called  Return  To  Macon  County  With  Him  And  Nolte  And  He  Was  Terrific  In  It  He  Was  The  Star  Of  Boy  And  His  Dog  Which  Is  A  Great  movie  Yeah  And  He  Did  All  Kinds  Of  TV  Movies  You  All  Through  The  70s  So  I  Was  Always  A  Big  Fan  Of  His  I  Always  Thought  He  Could  Have  Been  A  I  Would  Watch  TV  See  Somebody  And 
[02:39:30]  For  Some  Reason  I  Know  I  Be  Like  That's  That  Person  From  The  Baloney  Commercial  And  You  Know  They  Pop  Up  In  Other  Shows  And  For  Some  Reason  I  Always  Thought  That  Was  Kind  Of  A  Special  Thing  To  Be  Able  To  Recognize  That  And  Someone  What  Are  You  Talking  About  It  You  Don't  Understand  Well  You  It  Was  Funny  Because  When  I  Was  A  TV  Movies  With  My  Step 
[02:40:00]  Father  Now  I  Didn't  Know  Anything  About  Movies  I'm  Four  I  Don't  Have  A  Backlog  Yet  So  You  Know  My  Boy  Watching  With  My  Stepdad  Curtis  And  You  See  We're  Watching  Some  Movie  Okay  Quentin  You  See  That  Guy  Right  There  It's  Thomas  Mitchell  He  Was  The  Father  In  The  Original  Swiss  Family  Robinson  From  The  30s  Not  The  Disney  One  We  Saw  All  But  The  Original  One  Oh  Really  Huh  And  Then  We  See  That's  Roddy  McDowell 
[02:40:30]  He's  A  Really  Good  Actor  I  Like  Him  But  He  Was  A  Star  Even  When  He  Was  A  Little  Boy  He  Did  A  Movie  Called  National  Velvet  He  Thought  Oh  I  Guess  That's  What  Happens  When  You  Get  To  Be  An  Adult  You  Become  A  Movie  Genius 
[02:41:00]  So  I  Better  Start  Like  You  Preparing  Right  Right  That's  How  We  Did  You  Ever  Have  To  Explain  Who  You're  Casting  Like  Some  People  Going  Well  Quentin  That  Person  Is  A  Weird  Choice  Like  Now  I  Couldn't  Imagine  Anyone  Second  Guessing  Your  Fucking  Choices  On  Who  You're  Picking  As  Actors  You're  Pretty  Much  Proven  You  Know  What  You're  Doing  But  Has  It  Been  Early  Like  Really  That  Guy  Oh  No  No  No  Especially  With  The  Way  I  Was  Doing  It  I  Mean  The  Most  Famous  Example  Is  John  Travolta  Absolutely  Nobody 
[02:41:30]  In  The  Studio  Wanted  John  Travolta  And  Not  Only  That  It  Was  Like  It  Was  Considered  A  Really  Hot  Script  And  At  That  Time  When  He  Was  Turning  Everything  Down  Daniel  Day  Lewis  Expressed  Interest  In  Playing  Vincent  And  I  Like  Daniel  Day  Lewis  But  I  Really  Wanted  John  I  Had  My  Heart  Set  On  Him  And  And  It's  One  Thing  To  Want  The  Guy  Who's  Out  Of  Fashion  When  Nobody  Else  Wants  But  When  There's  Actually  A  Hot  Guy  You  Can  Get 
[02:42:00]  And  You  Want  To  Go  With  The  Guy  From  The  70  The  Guy  From  Barberino  I  Want  How'd  You  Talk  Him  Into  It  Cause  I'm  Sure  There  Was  Some  Pushback  Yeah  It  Was  Finally  Well  Truth  To  Those  It  Was  Kind  Of  A  Two  Prong  Thing  One  Was  The  Fact  I  Was  Just  Kind  Of  Tough  On  It  In  So  Far  As  They  Really  Wanted  To  Do  The  Movie  And  I  Just  Look 
[02:42:30]  If  I  Want  To  Go  This  Way  And  If  You  Don't  Agree  That  This  Is  The  Way  To  Go  Then  Maybe  We  Shouldn't  Make  This  Movie  Together  I  Should  Maybe  Make  It  With  Somebody  Else  We  Just  Don't  Agree  And  Wasn't  A  Take  It  Or  Leave  It  Kind  Of  Situation  Right  It  Was  Like  Look  I  Think  He's  A  Terrific  Actor  I  Think  What  You  Should  Do  Is  Watch  Him  And  Brian  De  Palma's  Blowout  And  If  You  Don't  Think  He's  A  Terrify  Then  Maybe 
[02:43:00]  Alternative  As  Far  As  I  Am  Concern  And  So  You  Know  It  Kind  Of  Was  That  But  Then  Also  Frankly  Once  We  Got  Bruce  Willis  Then  It  Was  Like  We  Had  Our  Big  Movie  Star  Right  Right  You  Know  We 
[02:43:30]  That  Turned  You  On  Because  I  Was  Going  To  Ask  You  What  Did  You  See  John  In  That  Even  Gave  You  An  Inkling  That  He  Could  Do  That  Part  Because  I  Had  Never  Really  Seen  Him  And  Anything  That  Would  Give  Me  The  Impression  That  He  Could  Have  Pulled  Off  Vince  Vega  Well  You  Know  Actually  I  Don't  Think  There's  Anything  About  His  Character  That  Similar  To  Vince  No  Not  At  All  Yeah  It's  Just  It's  A  Really  Good  Performance  Right  Okay  I  Mean  Frankly  To  Tell  You  The  Truth  Vince  Vega  Is  Kind  Of  Close  To  Barbarino  If  It's  Closer 
[02:44:00]  To  Any  Of  His  Characters  It's  Barbarino  Murdered  The  Sweat  You  Know  I  Think  He's  A  Little  Smarter  Than  Barbarino  But  Not  Drastically  But  You  Know  John  Travolta  Is  A  Really  Good  Comedian  And  It's  A  Funny  Movie  It's  A  Comedy  And  But  You  Know  His  Timing  On  Welcome  Back  Hotter  Was  Really  Fantastic  He's  A  Really  Good  Comedic  Actor  So  Frankly 
[02:44:30]  It's  Growing  Up  Watching  Him  As  Welcome  Back  Hotter  But  Also  Not  Only  That  Aside  From  That  There  Was  This  Aspect  John  Travolta  Is  A  Movie  Star  Just  Because  Everyone  In  Hollywood  Had  Forgotten  About  It  That  Just  Shows  How  Dumb  They  Are  That's  True  I  Actually  Walked  Down  The  Street  With  John  Travolta  At  His  Lowest  Ebb  In  Pre-production  Of  The  Movie  And  People  Would  Lose  Their  Minds  When  You  See  Him  We'd  Walk  Into  A  Regular  Restaurant  And  We  Had  To  Leave  Grease  Saturday  Night  Fever  I  Mean  The  Tourist 
[02:45:00]  In  Hollywood  Would  See  Him  And  Just  Lose  Their  Mind  It's  Like  People  Are  Dying  To  See  Him  In  Something  Worth  Watching  It's  Just  Stupid  Hollywood  That  Doesn't  Realize  It  Wow  Yeah  That's  Absolutely  What  What  The  Situation  Was  Well  I  Mean  You  Know  Actually  Kind  Of  Similar  To  The  Gigantic  Response  That  Liam  Neeson  Got  When  He  Did  Taken  People  Just  Been  Waiting  For  To  Be  In  A  Movie  They  Could  See  It's  Just  Hollywood  Wasn't  Smart  Enough  To  Know  It  You 
[02:45:30]  Like  Taken  Right  Actually  I  Haven't  Seen  Taken  Frankly  I  Didn't  Care  For  It  Yeah  That's  Well  That's  Why  I  Brought  It  I  Wanted  Hey  Steven  Philly  In  Capital  Letter  So  We  Have  To  Ask  This  Ask  Him  Why  Kurt  Russell  And  Sacha  Baron  Coen  Dropped  Out  Dropping  That  Sequence  It  Was  A  Scene  I  Just  Know  This  Will  Never  Make  The  Movie  Yeah  I  Just  I 
[02:46:00]  Don't  Have  The  Days  And  The  Time  And  The  Money  To  Spend  On  Something  That  I  Know  Is  Going  To  Get  Dropped  From  The  Editing  Room  So  I  Had  To  Call  Him  And  Just  Let  It's  Just  Not  Going  To  Work  Out  I  Just  I  Just  Know  The  Scene  Ain't  Make  The  Finish  Film  The  Movie  Is  Too  Long  As  It  Is  You  Know  So  That  Was  Why  That  Worked  Out  And  The  Other  With  Kurt  Kurt  Is  A  Great  Guy  And  He's  A  Good  Friend  I  Knew  I  Was  Going  To  Have  To  Cut  His  Character  Way  Down  I  Had  Already  Done  A  Lot  Of  The  Movie  I  Knew  How  Much  I  Pretty  Much  Had  Left  And  If  Anything  Had  And  If  I  Was  Going  To  Lose 
[02:46:30]  It  From  Anywhere  It  Would  Have  Been  From  His  Character  So  I  Kind  Of  Let  Him  Know  Look  The  Part  You  By  The  You  Was  It  You  Five  Months  Or  Six  Months  After  I  Given  Him  The  Role  We  Been  Doing  The  Movie  For  A  Long  Time  So  Now  We're  Getting  Into  The  Tail  End  Is  Which  He 
[02:47:00]  Was  The  Castration  Guy  That  Billy  Crash  Oh  God  That  Guy  Was  Great  Yeah  He's  Fantastic  That's  A  Horrifying  Fucking  Scene  Horrifying  I  Love  This  Inside  Stuff  Yeah  Kurt  Russell  Probably  Should  Have  Taken  That  Even  That  Guy  Was  Great  Because  That  Was  An  Amazing  Character  He  Was  Dark  Who  Was  Hatable  In  The  Movie  Again  Brilliant  I  Didn't  Recognize  Samuel  Jackson  Until  His  Mouth  Opened  And  Spoke  I  Didn't  Know  It  Was  Him  Oh  Really  And  He  Was  Again  Repugnant  His  Character  So  Well  Played  I  I  Never  Hated  Him  In  A  Movie  Before  Sam 
[02:47:30]  Is  He's  The  The  Theatrical  Beast  In  This  Movie  He  Comes  In  And  Just  Just  Takes  Hold  Of  The  Movie  And  You  Really  Just  It  Just  Grabs  Your  Attention  And  Never  Let's  Go  Yeah  You  You  Really  Want  To  Burn  Him  Alive  He's  A  Terrible  Guy  And  You  Kind  Of  Understand  Why  He  Is  The  Way  He  Is  But  I  Didn't  Think  You  Could  Hate  Him  Is  There  Any  Feet  Feet  In  This  Movie  No  Not  Really  A lot  Of  Poor  Black  Blistered  Feet  Walking  Through  Mud  And  Rock  No  Cute 
[02:48:00]  Feet  That  Doesn't  Make  You  Happy  No  Not  At  All  That  Means  You're  Really  Dedicated  To  Your  Work  I  Thought  You  Would  Have  Pretty  Feet  I  Have  Wondered  If  You  Ever  Expand  On  A  Story  With  No  Intention  Of  It  Going  Anywhere  But  Your  Own  Satisfaction  I'll  Give  You  An  Example  I  Was  Watching  Pulp  Fiction  And  Of  Course  Zed  Is  Laying  On  The  On  The  Floor  Bleeding  From  The  Crotch  And  He  Is  Ready  To  Have  Some  Serious 
[02:48:30]  Shit  Put  Down  On  Did  You  Ever  Expand  Upon  What  Happens  To  Him  After  Butch  Leaves  And  The  Hard  Pipe  Hitting  Niggas  Do  Show  Up  Did  You  Ever  Dwell  On  That  Yourself  Do  You  Ever  Do  That  Oh  I  I  I  No  I  I  Usually  Ask  Myself  Certain  Questions  About  I  Actually  Think  The  Movie  Keeps  On  Going  On  After  The  Scene  Stop  Exactly  That's  Absolutely  I  In  That  Case  I  Didn't  Take  It 
[02:49:00]  How  They  Dispose  Of  The  Body  Or  How  Many  Different  Pieces  The  Body  Was  In  When  They  Were  Finished  But  You  Know  It  Did  Involve  Pliers  On  A  Bow  Torch  Right  Yeah  Yeah  And  You  Can  Only  Imagine  What  Anthony  Tell  You  Is  He  Puts  A  Ball  In  His  Mouth  And  Wax  Off  Thinking  About  Being  Bent  Over  A  Sawhorse  By  The  Way  That's  Another  Thing  That  I've  Always  Been  Curious  About  And  You  Rarely  Get  The  Chance  To  Speak  To  The  Guy  I  Noticed  With 
[02:49:30]  The  Ball  Gags  Bruce  Willis  Had  His  A  Lot  Further  In  His  Mouth  Than  Bing  Did  Did  Bing  Have  A  Gagging  Problem  Because  It  Really  Was  Much  Further  Out  In  His  Mouth  I  Didn't  Really  I  Will  Check  That  Out  Next  Time  Please  Make  The  Bloopers  Real  When  You  Do  Something  Like  This  You  Start  To  Hear  Controversy  Swirling  Around  Language  Do  You  Ever  Think  Bad  Press  Is  Going  To  Hurt  You  Or  Do  You  Think  That  Any 
[02:50:00]  Press  For  The  Film  Is  Okay  Or  Do  Some  Some  Some  People  And  Some  People  Won't  That  Fine  Where  I'm  Coming  From  You  Have  A  Problem  With 
[02:50:30]  It  It's  Just  A  Movie  Don't  Go  See  It  Right  Right  Right  You  Know  But  At  The  Same  Time  It's  The  Flashpoint  Of  Right  Now  Yeah  Yeah  The  Movie  Is  Controversial  Because  It's  Coming  Out  Right  Now  And  Everyone  Is  Talking  About  It  It's  At  The  Forefront  Of  Everyone's  Mind  Because  There's  A big  Pre-release  Going  On  To  It  And  That  Was  Kind  Of  Put  Under  A  Microscope  But  That  All  Goes  Away  Seven  Months  From  Now  It's  Going  To  On  Showtime  Right  Right  Right  You'll  Be  Watching  It  In  Your  Loving  Room  At  Four  O'clock  In  The  Afternoon  How  Fucking  Controversial  Can  It  Exactly 
[02:51:00]  It's  It's  Not  Made  To  Pander  To  Anything  Either  It's  Not  You're  Not  Putting  Things  In  It  To  Be  Like  I'm  Going  To  Shock  Some  People  Here  It's  Part  Of  The  Story  Yeah  I mean  You know  Legitimately  Yeah  I mean  Literally  You know  You know  I'm  Sure  This  Movie  Won't  Get  A  Touch  The  Controversial  That  Ken  Russell  Got  When  He  Did  The  Devils  You know  When  It  Was  Released  In  Particularly  Like  In  England  Or  Any  Clockwork  Orange  Or  Anything  Like  That  But  Then  After  That  Flash  Point  Is  Over  Now  We  Live  In  A  World  Where 
[02:51:30]  Django  And  Chain  Already  Exist  Deal  With  It  Like  I said  In  Your  Living  Room  At  Four  In  The  Afternoon  Are  There  Any  Scenes  There  One  Scene  Why  It  Kind  Of  Affect  You  Like  That  Oh  Yeah  No  No  I  Mean  No  There's  Hard  Stuff  To  Watch  For  Sure  And  You  Know  Whenever  I've  Seen  Anything  That  Was  Like 
[02:52:00]  Really  Repugnant  It's  Turned  Me  Off  Yeah  I'll  Call it  That  I  Don't  Say  They  Don't  Have  The  Right  To  Do  It  But  I  Don't  Like  It  You  Know  And  I  Don't  Ever  Need  To  Watch  It  Right  You  Know  You  Know  There's  You  Know  But  I  I  Actually  Do  Think  For  The  Most  Part  Uncomfortable  Is  That's  A good  Adjective  To  Describe  For  That  I  Actually  Think  You  Know  People  Start  Using  Oh  I  Was  Offended  By  This  I  Was  Offended  By  That  I  Kind  Of  Feel  About  That  The  Way  Patriotism
