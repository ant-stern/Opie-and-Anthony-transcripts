<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion about aging celebrities and their perceived decline in attractiveness, featuring crude and sexually explicit commentary on numerous actresses including Raquel Welch, Ann-Margaret, Sophia Loren, Lonnie Anderson, Sally Field, Lucille Ball, Sharon Stone, Kelly McGillis, Kathleen Turner, Marissa Tomei, Bridget Bardot, and Pia Zadora.  The conversation also included reminiscing about adult magazines like *Wee*, *Cherry Boxes*, *Penthouse*, and *Playboy*, and allegations of Burt Reynolds' abusive behavior. Jim Norton’s anxieties about his career and desire for more creative control were also addressed, with caller Kathy offering advice. The segment concluded with anecdotes about a babysitter paid in marijuana and an upcoming interview with Brian Johnson of AC/DC, whose frequent use of the word "cunt" was highlighted.

The show then shifted to Anthony recounting a teenage sexual encounter, detailing the graphic physical appearance of the 19-year-old involved ("Buzz") and her popularity, even among Anthony's father.  He further discussed past relationships, including sharing recordings of a former girlfriend's ("Lisa") sexual encounters with her family as revenge.  His current girlfriend ("Bonnie") was described as "crazy," with their conflict about his salad-eating habits mentioned. A combative exchange between Opie, Anthony, and Rich Voss about psychology and Voss's perceived insecurities followed, including an attempt by Opie to probe Voss's childhood.

Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses then joined the show.  The conversation initially focused on Anthony's significant gambling losses at the Borgata casino (the exact amount undisclosed), before transitioning to McKagan's career, promoting his band Loaded's "The Taking" album and related movie.  They discussed the displacement of local businesses by corporations like Starbucks, the BP oil spill (with Cumia admitting to profiting from it), the death of a crab fisherman from "Deadliest Catch", and Guns N' Roses, including rumors of a Super Bowl halftime show.  McKagan detailed the band's early days in Los Angeles and the importance of record stores in their rise to fame.  The segment included off-color jokes and was later joined by Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath.

Tony Iommi discussed the creation of "Paranoid," Black Sabbath's future collaborations, Ozzy Osbourne's frugal habits, and his autobiography, *Iron Man*. He also recounted his early career, the impact of a factory accident on his guitar playing, fights with skinheads, a tense encounter between John Bonham and Ronnie James Dio, his experiences with the supernatural, his participation in the Rolling Stones' Rock and Roll Circus, and his brief time with Jethro Tull.

The show then returned to Anthony's recent car accident.  He described wrecking his Mustang, and discussed the resulting damage, his vertigo, and his reluctance to take time off.  The hosts and callers offered a mix of concerned inquiries, humorous jabs, and medical speculation, with calls from medical professionals, including "Dr. Steve," providing diagnoses and treatment suggestions.  Crude and offensive language was frequent.  Further discussion of the accident included speculation about a potential DUI, teasing from the hosts and callers, and unrelated tangents about bodily functions and Anthony's supposed racism. This segment featured a listener poll and a call to Sam Roberts’ mother, leading to increasingly vulgar conversations about guessing when she last saw her son's penis, culminating in an unsuccessful attempt to get her to participate in a crude on-air game.

A subsequent segment heavily featured a phone call with Sam's mother, Mrs. Roberts, with the hosts engaging in disrespectful and vulgar jokes about her age, health, and baking.  Finally, a studio guest, Eric, with a bleached-blonde hairstyle, was subjected to shock, ridicule, and numerous offensive and homophobic jokes about his appearance. The show concluded with more mockery of Eric’s hair and general banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh my god.  What's going on?  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's stupid.  Something ridiculously loud and obnoxious.  I sound like the best of Dallas Syndrome records.  We're never going to make everybody happy,  so why do we have to now make more people not happy?  Oh no.  It's stupid.  It's audio vomit.  If I may use the word duty.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Joe, would you do Freddie Mercury's mom?  I don't know what she looked like.  No, she's got to be 90 years old.  Joe likes really old women. 
[00:00:30]  What's the oldest one?  I've seen a six-year-old chick that I think is hot.  I've seen that.  Really?  These days?  In this day and age?  There's some hot old broads out there, dude.  I don't know.  I'm saying on the internet.  What's her face?  I'd still bang Raquel Welch.  You wouldn't bang Raquel Welch?  That's just a name now.  That's just a name now.  I'm with you, Joe, on this one.  She doesn't have a cock.  I'm there.  That's just a name.  I still would have circa grumpy old men and grumpier old men. 
[00:01:00]  I still would have banged Ann-Margaret or Sophia Loren in both of those movies.  I still would do them both today.  I need fucking some skin with some elasticity left to it.  Lonnie Anderson.  Lonnie Anderson.  What a mess she was.  There's plenty of elasticity.  I hated her.  There's plenty of elasticity.  It's just loose.  It's all loose.  It's just loose.  It's got to be gathered up.  Put her back of her neck in a scrunchie.  It's just old underwear skin.  Hanging on her like a doily. 
[00:01:30]  Wow.  No, I don't need that shit.  Is Lonnie Anderson still hot?  What does she look like?  It's got to be a wreck.  A lot of plastic surgery.  She had to cover up the bruises from Burt.  Yeah, Burt loved clocking her.  Did he?  Did he smack her around?  Oh, Burt was beating up fucking Sally Field.  The fucking flying nun.  What was she doing that he's got to pop her with her brittle-ass bones?  Her Boniva fucking bones.  Her osteoporosis.  Oh, her osteoporosis.  It's just old fractures.  He's just snapping ribs on her like Rocky in the fucking meat locker. 
[00:02:00]  How many of you out there were also beaten around the kitchen by Burt Reynolds?  I need to take these pills for it now.  No wonder she's got graham cracker bones.  She's probably got breaks on every single one of them.  I'm like an evil Knievel skeleton.  He's just wearing that fucking satin cannibal run jacket.  Shut your fucking mouth.  She sees him drinking and she's like, uh-oh, uh-oh.  I know it's coming.  One morning he wakes up and she fucking accidentally, you know, put his hairpiece in the wash. 
[00:02:30]  I thought it was a sock.  Fucking pow right in the face.  What's worse, getting beat by Burt Reynolds or getting beat and then having to hear that laugh as he does it?  Oh, yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then Dom DeLuise pops up.  Yeah, yeah.  Brings Dom over to watch.  Then they've got the outtakes from the beating.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I hated that.  The fucking beating outtakes.  That's great.  Hal Needham is showing him how to throw a punch. 
[00:03:00]  Stuntman Hal Needham.  That was fun.  That was fun maybe once.  The outtakes at the end of those dumb movies with Dom DeLuise.  Dude, the cannibal run outtakes, I could watch those over and over.  The outtakes, they are the greatest.  When he's going to hit Dom DeLuise, I'm like, don't hit me, don't hit me, don't hit me.  Oh, shit. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, shit.  Kidnap his baby shit compared to what this dude's doing.  He beats out of the field around the kitchen.  That's domestic abuse.  Look, boy.  Those sound effects were actually Joe DeRosa punching a tranny after he's talking about it.  After he realized what he just did.  Dealing with it by feelings. 
[00:04:00]  What would you work at it now?  Some tranny balls bounce out of his chin.  Fucking A, man.  Oh, shit.  Lucille Ball, Lebanese.  Kevin from Connecticut saying.  What?  She was Lebanese?  Lucy.  Kevin's saying that.  Her and Vivian Vance used to lez out.  No, they didn't.  They did not.  You've got to think Vivian Vance went that way.  She was batshit crazy.  Did you know that?  Vivian Vance?  She was so crazy.  She used to walk around with, she played Ethel, right?  Oh, there you go.  She used to walk around with her address written down and her pocketbook because she was so 
[00:04:30]  scared she was going to forget where she lived.  Really?  Really?  She was fucking batshit.  She was on one of those A.J. Benza fucking, hey, I'm A.J. Benza.  Hey, what fuck do you want?  Here's what happened in Hollywood, you fucking cocksucker.  I'm a guy that knows nothing about Hollywood, but listen to these stories.  Listen to these great stories.  Yeah, so it was one of those things.  And Lucia was French, Irish, and what?  And English?  Yeah, I don't think she was fucking...  Well, Ricky was Cuban.  A red-headed, blue-eyed Lebanese. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Ricky Desi Arnaz there, Cuban.  He knew how to hit a woman.  That was kind of ballsy, too.  He knew how to hit a woman.  Have a Cuban on TV back then?  Mm-hmm.  Very ethnic.  Has there ever...  I think Sharon Stone is the number one contender with Lucia Ball for hardest fall-off on...  Like, literally, one of the hottest women you've ever seen, and then the next day, you're  like, who the fuck is that?  Lucia went from kind of a quirky, cute thing, and then it was just like, ah, Mr. Mooney!  Mr. Mooney! 
[00:05:30]  Ah!  I can't make it to the bank today!  And here's Lucia.  Oh, it was horrible.  It was.  See, her voice just ravaged from filling all of cigarettes.  No filters.  They're smoking on the set of I Love Lucia.  Overnight, she just looked like Old Wilma.  Yeah.  Just overnight.  Like, what the fuck happened to her?  She was so hot, dude.  Sharon Stone had a drop-off, though?  I mean, Sharon Stone's still an attractive older woman, but it's like, Sharon Stone, dude,  basic instinct, and then all of a sudden, she had, like, that mom haircut, and she just 
[00:06:00]  looked horrid.  She just looked like an ant or something.  She looked good in a casino.  I thought she looked good in a casino, too, yeah.  There's nothing hotter than her in a casino.  She looks great.  Yeah, I know.  She made it late, though, too, like in her early 30s, so she wasn't, you know, a youngster  when she did it, but I'd still bang her.  Yeah, I would.  She looks great.  I saw her out at a restaurant in L.A. one day.  Did you?  Yeah.  Still?  That scene where she's in bed with Pesci, and Pesci goes to leave, and she's kind of  sitting there with a leg up, and it's outside of the covers and shit. 
[00:06:30]  She looked great in that.  Definitely.  I'm mad at her.  Yeah.  Yeah, it makes you sad, though, right?  Oh, shit.  It's great.  Fucking fantastic.  I like when there's stock drops.  I fucked up here.  I fucked up, Frankie.  She's more of an option.  She blows him on the couch.  Oh, right.  That's right, on the couch.  The chick that blows him to the car is when he's going.  Milk-fed veal.  Yeah.  You can pound that shit for days.  It'll never get tender.  And he just puts it in your head without missing a beat on the veal conversation.  Milk-fed veal.  Yeah.  That pink stuff. 
[00:07:00]  I like this topic, the drop-off, because Johnny Greensboro came up with the best one ever.  Kelly McGillis.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  We want to talk about a drop-off.  Yeah.  She's Tom Cruise's love interest in what?  Top Gun there, right?  Yeah, Top Gun.  And now she is completely dyked out.  She's got a Top Gun.  It's brutal.  Can someone grab it on the computer real fast?  All right.  She's a dyke now, right?  Have you seen the drop-off?  No.  You would swear it's not the same person.  Yeah, you're right.  I can't say anything bad about her. 
[00:07:30]  I have to tap out.  She's in a movie that a guy I know is directing and stuff.  A guy you know?  Yeah.  Ty West.  Ty's a fan of the show.  Yeah.  The Innkeepers.  So he hired an old lesbian.  Oh, she's in The Innkeepers?  That movie looks fucking awesome.  It's fucking great.  She was good in it?  It's amazing.  You know the guy that directed that?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's awesome.  He's a big fan of the show.  I went to the New York premiere.  It was fucking scary and funny and shit. 
[00:08:00]  He did something else that was awesome.  I can't remember that.  Fucking fuck, man.  Can you see The Innkeepers in regular theaters?  It's not out yet, but yeah.  Oh, it's not out yet.  I'm getting a total mental block.  Everyone's going to kill me.  You've got to see this, though.  Ant has officially tapped out.  Until I meet this guy.  I'm still in.  I'm about to see.  The biggest drop-off.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah, she turned handsome.  Holy shit. 
[00:08:30]  She turned handsome.  Yeah.  Well, she grew her hair in it at least a little bit.  The ones we saw, I don't know, a year or two ago, it was crew cut.  There you go.  That's what, yeah.  Oh, she's a...  Yeah, that's Kelly McGillis.  What, is she 50?  You would swear that's not her, right?  She's got to be older than that.  Yeah, I mean.  Wow.  That's the chick in the fucking little uniform and top gun.  I mean, look, I admire these, even though we're, like, goofing, I admire these chicks  that do that, that age naturally in Hollywood.  I love Helen Mirren. 
[00:09:00]  She's good.  Oh, it's still...  Oh, really?  That was the one.  That was the one when I was telling you, they were giving me so much shit because I  said I'd bang her stuff.  Well, I've got shit out to her recently.  Man.  We got a double...  She's great.  We got a double tap out on our hands here.  Uh-oh.  A lot of people mentioning Kathleen Turner.  She lives in my building.  Oh.  And she actually hears me walking around my apartment.  Oh, boy.  That's how close we live to each other.  Is she cool?  She's beyond cool, but...  God damn.  ...certainly a drop-off.  I'd love to meet Kathleen Turner. 
[00:09:30]  Really?  Oh, where did I meet her?  Yeah.  Come to my building today.  She's a little handsome, too.  She's around all the time.  Romancing the stone?  You shitting me?  She's around all the fucking time, man.  Is that Mirren?  Yeah, I'd go.  Look at that, dude.  I'd go Mirren.  Yeah, that's the best fucking case scenario right there.  We've seen other pictures where it's a world of hurt.  No problem.  Dude, if best case scenario is a picture of her in a bikini, you're doing all right.  Yep.  You know what I mean?  World of hurt.  I've cranked it out to this picture, in fact.  I would go there before Bailey there, Joe DeRozan.  Yeah, she's good. 
[00:10:00]  I'm a big Mirren fan.  You know who's holding on?  Shto wrong, if I may say so.  Oh, boy.  I saw her in a bar the other night.  She is holding on as fucking Marissa Tomei, dude.  Oh, yeah.  She looks amazing.  Yeah, she looks great.  No argument with that one.  Definitely.  She's only 43, right?  But, I mean, she doesn't have...  We were sitting across from her in a bar.  It was hard.  I was, like, having a hard time.  Did you talk to her? 
[00:10:30]  No, because I'm not, like...  She didn't have a dick.  No, yeah, yeah.  You imagine Marissa Tomei with a cock?  Perfect.  Yeah, there you go.  Now you're talking.  My cousin's weenie.  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  My cousin's weenie.  Look up Bridget Bardot.  She was hot, though.  Bridget Bardot.  She looked...  She was beautiful.  Cigars and Scots say, worst drop-off ever.  Oh, well, Bridget Bardot, that's old school.  Yeah, but some of these women, when they get really old, still hold them together.  I think there's a D in there.  B-R-I-G-E-T. 
[00:11:00]  D-E-T.  Yeah, there you go.  She's up there.  Yeah, she was fucking smoking back in the day with the big smoky eyes.  Oh, damn.  Look at that first picture.  That looks like Sally Struthers.  Oh, fuck.  Look at that picture.  All the way to the...  Look.  Like any picture of her in her youth is amazing.  Every woman in Hollywood's trying to get those lips, and she had them naturally.  Took those fucking lips.  What about all the way over and one down?  All the way over, one down.  No, the other way.  All the way over.  All the way.  Yeah, the other all the way.  Let me see that.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, that's good. 
[00:11:30]  Was she a porn star?  No, she was a movie star.  She did nudes, though.  She was a starlet.  Yeah, she did.  Remember Pia Zadora?  Same shit.  Pia Zadora, yeah.  Back in the day.  I remember seeing Pia Zadora in Wee magazine and spanking my fucking dick till it was all.  Wee was unbelievable at your lips and everything.  Oh, yeah.  Wee and cherry boxes.  I loved Wee.  High Society.  Those were the good old days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Swank.  If you wanted something classy, you can go for Mayfair.  Mayfair.  Mayfair.  Playboy was always such a letdown after fucking, like, you got into Wee and magazines like 
[00:12:00]  that.  And Pena House was always good, too.  Yeah.  Pena House was pretty good.  Pena House, yeah.  I used to read the letters from a madam.  Oh, great.  Xavier, what's her name?  Hollander.  Pena House Forum was...  Yeah, it was all good.  She got the job done, huh?  I thought I was a horny kid because I was wanking it out to words.  Yeah, to fucking a mental image.  Crazy.  Yeah, but you would rip a couple pages out and read Pena House Forum at the same time.  See, I would keep my thumb in the middle and just flicking that page when I was ready  to blow.  So...  Yes.  Fucking Playboy sucked. 
[00:12:30]  Fucking flip real quick.  It wasn't amazing how many pages you had to go through to get to nudity in Playboy?  It's like, it's fucking...  And then sometimes you flip through the whole thing and go, I didn't see one naked chick.  I missed.  That was the deal they made with the government, I think.  You could just flip to the nudes.  No.  I don't know how the fuck they did that.  Yeah, I don't...  I don't want to go from a centerfold to a fucking joke page.  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing funny when I'm looking at a centerfold.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to hear jokes.  You're about to come in some cartoon.  Yeah.  The most racist jokes ever was Hustler. 
[00:13:00]  Hustler was great for the racist jokes.  Ridiculously racist jokes.  No, they did everything.  Child fucking jokes and racist jokes, sexist jokes.  Fantastic.  That's when I really learned that being a perv or what your sexual appetite is, whatever,  it really is a genetic thing.  Because when we first all got into porn as kids, I was always like, get that fucking Playboy shit out of here.  I never was wowed by it.  I was immediately like, is that it?  Is that it? 
[00:13:30]  And my friends would be like, what do you mean is that?  And I was like, yeah, what the fuck?  I like Playboy like when I was seven.  Yeah.  It's like, okay, at least it's something.  Remember my friend's father would watch porn like he was watching the fucking news?  We'd go to his house and his dad would just be sitting there watching porn and he wouldn't shut it up.  We'd all be hanging out and his dad would just be watching it.  How old were you?  I was fucking 13.  We're talking like 83, 82, 83.  You could do that in those days.  It wasn't a fucking lawsuit.  And he would be smoking and watching it and I'm like, should I jerk off? 
[00:14:00]  I called my dad.  Was your friend's name a Sandusky?  I called my dad.  Completely passed out on the couch with a hardcore fucking porn on.  And I was like 17.  So I had to tell him when I was home.  He was waiting up for me.  It was a curfew type of situation.  And it was so fucking awkward.  I had to wake him up as the moaning was coming from the team.  He's like, oh, how did this get on the team?  I got my dad.  Did he have a rod?  A rod.  But then in a weird way, I was like a little more proud of my dad. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, exactly.  All right, my dad's cool.  Yeah.  We never talked about it after that.  I probably could have done the cool thing and changed the channel before I woke him up,  you know, but chose not to.  You think?  My dad started critiquing my porn.  I'm not making it in my own, because I would like, I would forget, like, I would leave  it in the VCR or something.  Oh, that's the worst thing you could do.  And then my mom thought she was taping The Young and the Restless, and she'd go to put  it on.  She'd be like, oh, oh.  And then my dad pulled me aside when I go, because I like older broads, and from a young 
[00:15:00]  age, I always liked older broads.  I'd get like, you know, like over 40, mature, whatever the fuck.  My dad pulled me aside.  Why don't you get something with nice young girls in it?  Yes.  Who wants to see all these bloody old, wrinkled women?  And I'm like, yeah, no, it's just what I could get.  Shit.  That's great.  You should be critiquing that.  My dad caught me whacking off.  Wow.  Because I passed out.  Oh, no, how embarrassing. 
[00:15:30]  I was home from college, and I was so fucking drunk and so fucking high, I literally passed  out mid-whack-off.  Oh, I've done that every night, actually.  Yeah.  That's how I go to sleep.  I fall asleep with my laptop on my chest.  The burning from the heat wakes me up.  The hot battery.  Awful.  Fucking literally cock still in hand.  Oh, yeah, that's it.  Oh, man.  Still in hand, waking up to my dad going, hey, hey, lesbian porn blaring on the fucking 
[00:16:00]  TV.  At least it wasn't cock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At least it wasn't that train porn you're into there, Joe.  So what did he say?  He literally just went, dude, I'm not exaggerating.  Tissues on the arm, chair.  You had all the features.  You're professional.  Lesbian porn fucking blaring.  You were a cliche of someone jerking off.  Yeah.  My mom and dad are upstairs.  I'm in the living room.  My dad.  You jerked out with lube in the living room?  Yeah.  Because that was the only VCR in the house.  Oh, that's a bold move right there.  I was out of my, I was so drunk and he shook me and I woke up and I'm still holding my 
[00:16:30]  dick and I go like that and he just goes, I think you should go to bed.  I did.  He never, ever spoke to me about it.  I hope that was a dream or something.  I hope that didn't happen.  Oh, fuck.  I think it happened.  He woke me up the next morning and my dad never did that.  He always let me sleep in.  He didn't give a shit.  And the next, it was a Saturday and he woke me up and he goes, Hey buddy, um, I made some  pancakes. 
[00:17:00]  And that was his way of being like, look, everything's cool.  You know, he didn't want, he didn't want you to have to approach him.  If he, if he fucking Freudian slips, Hey buddy, I made you some Hancock's.  Or if he woke you up by shaking your dick.  I just need some extra batter.  Oh, geez.  Yeah.  Geez.  Well, you're listening to the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show, on the virus, Sirius XM. 
[00:17:30]  Do you have a thing?  Almost like you don't deserve it or something.  I don't know what it is.  I'm not a psychologist.  Do you have a thing you're working on?  He's got a thing.  Is there a thing?  He's working on a thing.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  I mean, I want to try something.  He's got a little thing.  A little thing.  He's going to be gone for a little while with his thing.  But I've been working really hard on the thing with no, there's no reason yet because  I have no, no one has any interest in it.  No one is, I don't know what I'm doing.  No, that's not true.  I mean, in a sense, like I'm nervous that. 
[00:18:00]  You're pitching the thing.  I am pitching the thing.  But I'm nervous that.  So there's an interest.  No, no, no.  To be pitching once, no one has seen it.  So it's like they have no interest until they see it.  But it's like if you pitch something and it doesn't go, then your work has been for nothing.  Right.  Wow.  Yeah.  But no, it wasn't.  It was.  It'll all be there.  So we're always afraid that you're going to be validated as like what you thought was  good wasn't.  So it's easier to not take the risk. 
[00:18:30]  And I find myself, you know, I don't sabotage things by like, you know, running through  the room with a bat, but I subtly will do that to myself, like keep pushing it back  and keep pushing it back.  And I'm like, I'm just afraid of fucking.  That's human nature.  Yeah.  That's not a surprise at all.  I think everybody does that.  It's bad, though, because it's pushed back too far.  All of a sudden, the moment.  You should leave in your comfort zone.  Yeah.  You know what you got right now.  So to push past that is very scary for just about everybody.  I like being comfortable. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  You like being comfy.  You do look like you're unraveling, though, now that I look at you.  I feel that way.  I really do.  No, it's OK.  I do feel that way.  I don't see it at all.  I'm just fucking.  I just feel like high tension.  Really?  I had to go for my fucking stupid stress test yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  See?  You go to my heart guy.  Now that probably got you a little.  Did you do a heart thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The nuclear heart test.  And?  Well, I won't know for a few days.  They have to go over the results.  But they you walk on a treadmill and they inject you even IV and when you're on the 
[00:19:30]  treadmill and they're fucking and they inject you with this nuclear material.  Yeah.  And I mean, I just want to.  I want to breathing heavy.  Not that bad.  I mean, she said I was actually I did.  I did well, like as far as good.  I was breathing on the final when they they rev the treadmill up and you're going up a  hill.  But even that I was OK.  I wasn't terrified that you have no blockage.  My fucking apnea sucks a dick.  Oh, really?  Because then you have to lay under this fucking thing and they take photos of your heart for  five minutes and then 18 minutes. 
[00:20:00]  So for 23 minutes and then you leave for a couple hours and then you come back and do  more pictures.  But I kept falling asleep on the table, which was nice that I could do that.  But my apnea, I kept waking up and I was like a fucking quarter inch under this thing.  It was really claustrophobic.  Oh, I couldn't sleep.  I hate my apnea.  Fucking faggot throat.  I hate it.  I just want to doze off on my back. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, he's going for that breath.  Yeah.  You want a psych, a psychiatric nurse?  Sure.  Why not?  Who is this bitch?  Let's say I kill it.  Kathy and me.  Kathy.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Kathy.  Welcome aboard, Kath.  Hi, guys.  Love you, cartoon.  Sorry.  Jesus.  You had to mention that.  You sleeping all right?  No, not really.  Yeah.  See, that's it.  I didn't hear the part about the cardiac test before I called.  Oh.  Well, you just did.  I think Jimmy has anxiety because he's getting his shit checked out and it makes you wonder, 
[00:21:00]  right?  Maybe, yeah.  That's part of it, probably.  Until you get the test results and everything's fine, which I believe will be.  You're a little like, what the fuck?  My stomach's been acting weird, too.  I've been like, every time I go on the road, I've been feeling really queasy and shitting  pure liquid.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, what's wrong with me?  I have anxiety, Jim.  Maybe that's it, but I don't know.  Things are going too well for Jimmy.  You're an anxious little boy.  And he's uncomfortable with that.  You got it.  It's like Ope said.  You got it.  You got it made and, you know, give Ope a break. 
[00:21:30]  Made in the shade.  No, I don't feel like things are going too well.  I feel like I'm running on it.  Like, I hate to say it, running in place.  I feel like.  How can you say that?  Because you have to.  Look at all the great stuff you've had in the last year.  You're a regular on Leno.  Now you're pretty much becoming a regular on Chelsea Handler.  That's some good shit.  All that stuff is great stuff, and it's fun stuff, but it's.  What is it?  When you look at who is, like, when you look at guys that are successful, like really.  The people we compare ourselves to are our peers.  You know what I mean? 
[00:22:00]  You see guys doing really good things.  It's like, I don't want to just be doing things.  You're not happy with the mediocrity of our lives?  I'm happy.  I love the gig.  I don't want to leave radio.  I love doing radio.  Yeah.  And I love doing Leno and I love doing Chelsea, but I kind of want to have something that  I do that's fucking like, I'm not on somebody's dick.  That's Jim Norton.  Yeah, because you feel like, you know, I'm always relying on other people.  I don't always want to rely on other people.  It's like you fucking, you start to feel like, what are you doing?  You coward fucking.  You know what I mean?  I start getting mad at myself.  Stop waiting for other people.  Well, it's not like you're, this is good because it's not like you're just not doing anything. 
[00:22:30]  You are.  You're trying to do things.  You're working on a lot of things, you know, to get out of that, which is good.  People that just sit on their ass and they're like, oh, this, that, and don't do anything.  That's the problem.  Yeah, I know.  But I just, you know, I'm happy with the other stuff.  You know what?  I'm bored with this conversation.  Wow.  I'm bored with this.  No, but it's.  Wow.  No, but you understand.  It's his fucking. 
[00:23:00]  He's hoping his heart out.  He's looking at like 10 feet of snow all around me.  I'm running my dog.  No, I'm not bored.  You know, I know.  I don't feel bad about myself in the sense like I don't work.  I know I work hard.  I know that.  And believe me, I love the fact that the segments on Leno are going pretty well.  You're uncomfortable with your success because you think it's just going to all go away or something.  I'm uncomfortable with it because I'm not happy with the level of it.  Like, I'm happy where I am now.  Will you ever be happy, though?  Sure.  Sure.  What will make you happy in the biz? 
[00:23:30]  In the business.  I don't.  It's an indescribable thing, but it's.  Would it be having.  Because, I mean, being a regular on Leno is pretty huge.  That would make a lot of us fucking happy, obviously.  What if you had your own show?  Possibly, yeah.  Own TV show.  Look at a guy like Louie.  He's a good example of a guy.  If you had what Louie's got kind of right now.  Or something similar, let's say.  Because you're different people.  Would you shut the fuck up?  No, the thing was.  Louie's a good example of a guy who had a bunch of things that didn't go.  But he's driven and he does what he does. 
[00:24:00]  And then all of a sudden, whatever it was, his head kind of poked above.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that happens, and it's an indescribable thing, because before Dane got to be the level  Dane, and I'm not saying I want to sell arenas out.  You would.  Dane was fucking very well known before he sold arenas.  Like, Dane was doing 3,000 seats.  Dane didn't just go from fucking 50-seat comedy club to 17,000.  Uh-huh.  But he was, like, lurking below that level for a long time.  So was Chappelle.  I remember Chappelle for years was getting pilots and they weren't getting picked up. 
[00:24:30]  He was right there, right there.  And then they poked their head above.  I like how you explained that, poking your head above.  I can understand that.  Yeah, there's all of a sudden something happened.  We used to call it clicking up a notch.  Yeah.  But everyone...  Like, you can't describe it, but you knew it was happening.  Everyone is just waiting, because they know you're going to poke your head up any moment  now.  Possible.  It's all just been kind of, like, you know, brewing for you.  It's happened for, like, Rogan's at that point, because the UFC, all of a sudden,  like, he's now...  He poked his head up.  Yeah.  It's like, and that just happens, because people knew who he was. 
[00:25:00]  He had Fear Factory.  He had so many things.  But all of a sudden, this UFC gig just kind of put him on that next...  And then one day, you just poke your head up.  I get it.  It just happens, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's going to happen, though.  But you have to...  It has to be something that you kind of make happen.  So if you had your own TV show?  If I was happy with it, yeah, sure.  Not someone else's show that you're in.  Your own TV show.  Even with somebody else's show that I was in that I was happy with my stuff in, yeah.  But my show I would prefer to have where you like what you're doing, and you feel  good about it.  It doesn't have to be on fucking CBS. 
[00:25:30]  I'm not saying that.  The stuff I've written is kind of, you know, it's harsh.  Some of the language is harsh.  I don't expect it to be on network TV.  So it's not about the biggest audience.  Yeah, like FX.  Or there's a million...  That's one thing.  It's like the language barriers that rescued me started...  Lifetime.  I would love to do something in Lifetime called Kiss This, and it's a picture of my knuckle  on the poster.  She Got Lippy, a mini-series.  Yeah.  I'm sure everybody has those moments in their jobs, though, where you just...  Not that I'm not grateful. 
[00:26:00]  I love it.  My apartment's pay...  Like, I have a great life.  I'm very grateful.  Is it because you're changing?  No, I don't think so.  Menopause?  No, my act is the same.  I'm fucking...  When you decide to change your life, it's really scary, because everyone knows their  comfort zone, even if that comfort zone is hell on earth.  At least you know what it is.  And when you try to, like, move on and change yourself, it's fucking scary, man.  Yeah.  You almost feel like you don't know yourself.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's why I think most people just don't want to change, because they're comfortable 
[00:26:30]  with what they have.  They understand it, even though they know there's probably a better life for them.  Yeah.  And every time I've expanded the comfort zone, whether it was coming into New York...  That's scary, man.  But it always, all of a sudden, feels better.  Like, all of a sudden, it just becomes part of your comfort zone.  Right.  It's like, you know, it's like chick talk, but it's fucking...  Whatever.  I've just been bothered for a while.  Like, my act, I'm very happy with the way it goes on stage.  The crowd likes it.  I feel like I've always been writing, but then a part of me just hates my own guts on stage.  Like, I shouldn't say that before plugging gigs, but, you know... 
[00:27:00]  It's going to be another fucking sad show in Cincinnati this weekend.  Oh, God.  Yeah, some maudlin.  Throw antidepressants on stage for Jimmy.  Oh, shit.  No, I don't feel necessarily depressed.  Just like, a little nervous, frightened.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Kathy, you added a lot.  I really appreciate your phone call.  Yeah, thanks, Doc.  Just amazing stuff.  You should have your own TV show on own.  It's just... 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, right.  It's going to happen for you.  Expect a bill, huh?  Holy shit, wow.  Yes, Kathy?  Free advice.  This is just unbelievable.  You got a...  This is going to sound really gay, but you got a...  Hey.  Hey.  Don't say that, man.  Exactly.  The fag is going to get pissed off.  Gay.  You've got a great support system with those two.  Sure.  You really do.  No, it's awesome.  With who?  Just what you got with you.  Oh, really?  We don't support each other.  We used to.  It used to be fun and cool.  Jesus. 
[00:28:00]  Listen to what you just said to each other.  What did they say?  Go ahead, Doc.  No, I'm not saying nothing.  Stop listening.  It's a listening show for me.  It's like...  It's almost like...  Meeting a lot of celebrities is a lot of fun,  and I really do love it.  Hmm?  But you realize what a nobody you are.  When as many people as I've met that I liked  had no idea who I was,  it's like...  After a while, the evidence is in. 
[00:28:30]  It's not a fucking...  It's not a low self-esteem thing.  It's just...  That's where you're crazy.  But no, dude, I'm telling you.  Dude, I've been with you 10 years, man.  We can't even walk around anymore  without people recognizing you.  Nah, no.  Fans doing stuff like that.  I know.  Nah, man, because it used to be like  we got recognized because of the radio show.  Now you get recognized.  I don't get recognized  because they know you from other places now.  A lot of other places.  I know.  You've poked your head up a little bit. 
[00:29:00]  I guess I'm just tired of being a fanboy.  Your head is almost completely above water.  You're poking.  Oh, tired of being a fanboy?  Pardon me, yeah.  You're poking, sir.  You're poking.  You're turtling.  You're turtling.  You're just about ready to fucking...  You're prairie dogging.  You're prairie dogging.  No, I just...  You know, whatever.  I mean, I'm not in a fucking depressed place.  I'm just, you know...  Yeah.  I just...  Kathy, will you add something?  Yeah, Kathy, what?  I'm just listening and enjoying it, but, you know...  Enjoying a man's misery?  Great.  Yeah, but I'm not miserable.  I'm just in a weird, like, eh.  You're miserable. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I'm sitting here...  I'm teasing of course.  I'm sitting here looking...  I'm sitting here looking at the snow.  I'm up in Maine, and I'm, you know, it's the greatest life.  And listening to you, Jimmy, you do have it made that I can see where that little poking  depression pops in, or that little bit of what you're questioning, who you are.  It is.  Who am I?  What do I want?  You are completely useless.  No, I'm not saying I can't.  I'm saying I kind of know what I want.  Who am I?  I'm a mediocre man.  What do I want?  There's no... 
[00:30:00]  No need to call him Jimmy Watley.  Yeah.  Come on.  No, I'm not that bad.  All right.  I worked all night.  I love you guys.  All right, Cassie.  I've had too many relative comparisons.  That's the problem.  You have too many fucking...  Is that it?  Yeah, because again, doing shows with people and meeting them is great.  And I get pictures, because a lot of times I get, oh, I fucking humiliated myself again  on the fucking plane going out to L.A.  Uh-oh.  Not humiliated, but embarrassed myself.  Oh, no.  Even when people do recognize me. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, no.  Who's the Black Eyed Peas guy?  Will?  No, not the Black guy.  It's the Asian guy with the long hair.  Oh, yeah.  You told me.  Were you mad that I never wrote back because I couldn't care less?  Oh, no.  I didn't realize that.  No.  Jimmy was excited and texted me that he was on the plane with a Black Eyed Peas.  Yeah.  And I realized I never wrote you back.  That's fine.  I'm sorry.  I should have wrote you back.  Please.  I was...  We took the flight, and one of the Black Eyed Peas was on the flight with his manager.  And, yes, that's him. 
[00:31:00]  And at the end of the flight, the manager said to me, hey, man, I really like your stuff.  I'm like, oh, thanks.  And then the guy...  Taboo.  Taboo.  Taboo.  I didn't even know his name.  Oh, Taboo.  That's Taboo.  Taboo.  He, uh...  He, uh, shakes...  Right before the plane is ready to descend, he's, uh...  He comes over to my seat.  And he goes, oh, hey, man, I really like your stuff. 
[00:31:30]  And we shake hands and go, oh, hello.  How are you?  And, you know, whatever.  So as we're all getting off the plane a little while later, the manager invites me to the show.  They're doing the show that night, the Thursday.  He's like, hey, they're doing this thing with John Legend if you want to come.  Fuck, that's cool.  And I'm like, yeah, so the manager has me call his numbers, so we have each other's numbers.  And, uh, I'm like, I do want to get a photo with this guy.  I'm like, you know, I wasn't really going to, but I'm like...  When I watched the way the flight attendants were fawning over him, they never fucking act like that.  I'm like, this is a...  This guy...  This is the Super Bowl.  It's a massive band. 
[00:32:00]  Why not?  Um, so he's like, you don't have to play.  I'm like, I fucking...  I'll ask him.  He won't have a problem with it.  But then it's taken him a while to come off the plane.  And then I realize it's because he's stopping to take a bunch of pictures.  Oh, oh, oh.  But then, so when he comes off the plane, I've actually just been standing outside for like 10 minutes waiting.  Oh, boy.  Outside the area.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he comes over.  I'm like, hey, I hate to be a fanboy.  I'm like, let's take a photo.  He goes, yeah, let's do it.  So we took the photo.  I don't even want to look at it. 
[00:32:30]  But then they walked away.  I was just embarrassed because I kind of blew it.  But then they walk away.  You did what Opie did with Obama.  Obama.  I thought of that.  I thought of that.  But then it's worse.  Then it's worse.  Because I went in and go to the bathroom.  Oh, no.  I went and go to the bathroom.  And I come out.  I'm like, I want some Starbucks.  So I'm walking.  And I realize I'm walking towards the wrong way towards baggage claim.  I'm walking towards baggage claim.  I'm walking the wrong way.  I went the wrong way.  And then I see a Starbucks.  So I go, oh, this is the wrong way.  And I turn around and come back. 
[00:33:00]  But when I turn around and come back, I realize that Taboo and his manager are coming out of the Starbucks.  So they probably thought I was looking for them.  Oh, no.  And then saw them and then was turning around to walk with them.  And I was like, oh.  And I actually went in and got a coffee I didn't want.  Just so they wouldn't think that.  I couldn't.  I was so humiliated because I knew that they thought I was looking for them.  Do you think they're like, oh, Jesus.  Yeah, but I never heard from the manager to come to the show.  Oh, no.  I didn't hear from the manager. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  I didn't blame them, though.  Yeah, you would have been a problem.  They probably were like, oh, this guy is just going to be a problem.  And he's going to be annoying.  Like a big annoying fan.  And oh.  Oh.  I love it.  Wow, that is a horrible story.  I know.  I'm such a dick.  I love it.  I'm such a dick.  So what is Forgy like?  I kept thinking of Forgy. 
[00:34:00]  Forgy.  What is Forgy like?  I was so embarrassed.  The worst part was waiting.  If he had just walked up the plane, I grabbed the photo.  Yeah.  But the embarrassing part was that I had to wait because I realized he was taking pictures.  And he knew while you were standing there.  Of course he did.  And then by the Starbucks, it's like, oh, he's following us?  He's a fucking stalker.  Oh, and then I saw them again.  Oh, no.  No way.  Yes.  And then when we walked out, we got my Lagage.  And we walked out. 
[00:34:30]  And they're ahead of us crossing.  If you go over to LAX and you cross the two little streets to get to the parking garage,  you go to the airport in the country.  And they're on a little island in between.  And he sees me coming and he raises his coffee like, you know.  Hey.  Hey.  You know, we click cups.  And then I was like, we were just walking across the street together.  So I was just asking him about how do you do a gig when you fly?  Because I hate to do a gig the night I fly.  It was actually a normal thing, I said.  But I think the manager got a little creeped out that I was walking across the street. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, that's like, here he is again.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  Oh, Jimmy.  I should have just said hi.  Yeah, yeah.  You should have just said hi and left it at that.  Hey, thanks.  Be the cool guy.  I know.  Be like the guy that just goes, hey, thanks, man.  Yeah, I like your stuff, too.  Hey, good job.  I'm a sap.  But you like picture?  I know.  Hi.  I'm a fucking Justin Bieber.  Yeah, what are you doing?  You got to get a picture with Justin Bieber. 
[00:35:30]  I do.  He's the hottest entertainer in the fucking world right now.  You know, he is actually in Lady Gaga.  I don't understand it, but you got to get the picture, at least.  Yeah.  Although, can I say, I can't.  And Lady Gaga is going to be around for a long time.  The Bieber shelf life, two years tops.  Maybe.  That picture is going to be nothing in a few years.  Unless he acts.  He ain't going to do the Justin Timberlake thing.  I had this whole discussion with him during the last break.  Done.  He's not going to be able to cross over.  No, he might be right.  Most of those guys go away.  Timberlake was able to figure it out.  And he's pretty much the only one in recent memory that went boy band to something else. 
[00:36:00]  Not the Biebs.  I'm just like, what am I doing waiting for a photo with a 16-year-old who doesn't know  who I am?  Like, what the fuck am I doing?  Who cares who he knows who you are?  But the point is...  I could care less, but I would get the picture.  Why?  Like, Ozzy or Sabbath or Kiss mean something to me, so that's different.  You know what I mean?  When people mean something to you, you should be a fan of Wade.  Yeah.  But I'm standing there nervous, like, trying to just coordinate to get a photo with a...  Like, what the fuck am I doing?  And I know it's going to be kind of a funny photo.  Like, I kind of know that people who know me, just the juxtaposing of us two is kind 
[00:36:30]  of funny for people who know me, but...  But how did you tweet it?  I didn't tweet it yet.  Tweet it with a funny line.  Yeah.  Me and Rachel Maddow.  I'm obsessed with that, but...  That was funny.  Yeah, I know.  He does look like him.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Hey, we got Brian Johnson tomorrow.  Yeah.  So there.  And I got him too? 
[00:37:00]  I'm going to tell him, you guys are stupid.  I don't know that.  Have you ever had him yet?  No.  You're talking, man.  You're going to have a ball with him.  Yeah.  He's funny.  Yeah.  You're going to need a translator, though.  That's all right.  You're going to need a...  I mean, I'm not...  He's like...  He can understand a fucking word.  When I first started writing a book yesterday, I was...  And I got this great fucking joke there.  It's going to be a great time. 
[00:37:30]  That's what I'm saying.  Saluting up.  Go on and fucking in here.  Have you seen us?  He really has never left Newcastle.  Really?  Yeah.  He's part of England, which is like our Alabama.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  That makes perfect sense.  You don't think of it that way.  Dude, did I ever tell you when I went to dinner with him with my wife?  Oh, no.  Dude, this is the funniest.  And we got to know...  Okay. 
[00:38:00]  We go to dinner.  Now, my wife...  All right.  Now, my wife is not born again, but like...  At first, she went born again.  She scales it back.  She pulled it back.  I remember you saying that.  She pulled it back, but she's still there.  Okay.  So, she's like...  He calls up.  He's like, we're going to bring our lassies to dinner.  Let's go to dinner.  I'm going to bring our lassies.  Lassies.  So, I bring her to my friend's place, down in Little Italy.  So, we go down there, and he brings his wife, and Dee's there, and we started... 
[00:38:30]  Now, Dee, at every meal, bows her head, and just silently does a quick...  So, when she does that, I try to distract her.  Like, hey, yeah, so who's the opening band in the garden?  Who's playing there tomorrow?  Yeah, it's a big game.  Did you see the designing over there?  It's a beautiful Italian art.  Oh, shit.  But, now, me and him are drinking...  We're just plowing through red wine, and everything out of his mouth is fucking cunt. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Everything.  He's like, fucking cunt, you're cunt, you're cunt, you're cunt, you're cunt, you're cunt.  And I keep looking over at her, and she's laughing, she's laughing her asses off.  And he starts going, you know, I go to this great place in fucking France, and we're in  a big yacht, and we wave, and we go along the crowd, and we wave to all the cunts and  the cunts and the cunts of the fucking cunt.  And then, yeah, they're going to come to Florida, like a big fucking pool, the fucking cunts  all over the fucking, it's a great fucking time. 
[00:39:30]  So, it was about 550 cunts, 10,000 fucks.  And we finish dinner, and we're leaving, and Dee's face is laughing.  She's like, he's one of the funniest guys I've ever met.  I told you, he's fucking hilarious.  Great.  She's like, hey, what a sweetheart.  I said, how cool, though, he invited, he wants us and the kids to go down there.  She's like, we're never, ever going.  So, he said cunt 400 times before he knew my name. 
[00:40:00]  We can't put our kids around.  We can't put our daughters around that.  I was like, it's Brian now.  She's like, Jim, he said cunt 500 times.  And that's perfectly understandable when he says it.  It is.  You can understand that.  When he says it, it sounds like art.  Right.  You'll see.  He'll do it tomorrow.  Yeah.  Well, you know, they're driving a fucking cunt, and there's a fucking cunt, and fucking cunt.  And it's not, cunt is not as bad over there.  No.  No, and it's not the way he says it, too.  He says cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Yeah.  You'll see. 
[00:40:30]  Fucking cunt.  Oh, don't, don't miss.  Kevin's saying we had him on before.  I thought we had the other guy.  No, we had Angus Young.  We had Angus.  Angus is completely different.  Yeah.  He was very odd.  Did you see?  By the way, you're ACD's fan, right?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Have you seen the new freaking DVD?  No.  Holy shit.  You remember that ACDC video that came out, the concert video?  This is that times 20.  I'm not.  Why?  I saw the ad for it. 
[00:41:00]  It looks fucking insane.  The people are, the crowd is bouncing.  Bouncing?  Yeah.  From the first song to the very end.  And the whole time I'm looking for all the editing, I'm like, all right.  They basically, they took one section, they just kept, they sing along to, they sing along  to the guitar riffs.  So when it's going, da-da-da, 100,000 people, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, and then they just  start, it looks like liquid. 
[00:41:30]  It looks like liquid.  It does.  It really does.  It just moves like waves.  And Brian Johnson's voice.  I keep listening for how they, he is clearly singing the way he's, it's, it's, it's crazy.  It made me realize there, no offense to Stones, but this is, this probably is the greatest  rock band that ever existed.  Look at this.  No, wait, wait, wait.  It's like a Nuremberg rally.  Bro, watch when the song kicks in. 
[00:42:00]  This is the new DVD by ACDC.  Watch when it kicks in.  It's a sea of people, and it literally, like Anthony said, looks like liquid.  They just start bouncing, and it, and it's, and they know every single word.  Watch this, watch this.  This, this is the greatest DVD, I've watched it 20 times already.  Wait, look at it, they mosh pinning, they were freaking mosh pinning, look at that, look 
[00:42:30]  at that.  It's an ocean of people.  Look at that.  It's, it's, oh my God, that's, I got goosebumps.  You gotta think you're gonna die in that crowd.  Oh, it was, it was the greatest, this is by far the greatest rock DVD concert I've ever  seen in my life.  River Plate.  Where are they, uh, what is it out now?  No, it's in, I don't know, is that what he's promoting tomorrow?  No, no, he's promoting a book tomorrow.  Which is very funny.  They did in Buenos Aires.  Yeah, what'd you get, I gotta get, you think they'd give me a book to, uh, know what I'm 
[00:43:00]  interviewing tomorrow.  Yeah, it's all about, uh, his relationship with cars, but it's not about cars.  He, like, he talks about them, but very, very funny.  And then he tells a story about, like, you know, how he's fucking tried to get laid in  one, or, he has great stories about all of them.  It's very, it's a great book.  He's a phenomenal, he should go on tour just as a storyteller.  I was wondering if he wrote this, I'm like, this is too funny for a rock guy, but I guess  he, he must have.  Oh, I guarantee you he wrote it, and he probably just had a guy sitting there, transcribed it.  Transcribed it.  Transcribed it.  He should, oh, forget it, forget it, the thing's out of control. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Out of control.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Some woman's in trouble for paying the babysitter in pot or something?  Yeah.  What a great story.  What is, what an idiot.  But what I don't understand about this, how, how did the, the media find out about this?  If you're a babysitter that likes pot, and the mom or the dad goes, hey, instead of giving 
[00:44:00]  you cash, you know, I like a little pot too.  I'm just going to pay in pot.  The only thing that makes sense is that the kid, the babysitter got busted and flew her  in to her parents.  You know what I'm saying?  She walks in the door, mom finds a dime bag, whatever, and says, where the hell did you  get this?  They paid me.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Because she was, the, the babysitter obviously was cool with the situation, but I'm guessing  that she got.  Okay.  The babysitter, babysitter, babysitter, babysitter shouldn't have ratted.  She's like, oh, I found it. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Found it.  The babysitter panicked.  Right.  She panicked and blew her in.  Yeah.  It goes back to when, you know, you got that one kid banging the French teacher and then,  and then you got an asshole that fucking spoils it for everybody.  Because they're not a rat.  And rats it out to their little mommy.  Little fucker.  Right.  Right.  They're jealous.  Yeah.  No, I don't even think it's jealousy.  They just got to tell?  They got to tell.  I mean, they're little rats.  I'm going to tell.  And if you've got a kid in your high school that's banging teachers, keep it to yourself. 
[00:45:00]  He's a hero.  That's cool as all hell.  Yes.  Or blackmail.  See if you can get in there.  Well, I've heard that happen.  There have been some stories where the guy's been like, look, I'm going to tell.  You better tell that chick to give me a blowjob.  You know, you learn to keep quiet when you get older, but I think if you're 16, 17, and  you're banging the hot French teacher, I keep saying the hot French teacher because  I had a really hot French teacher with the French perfumes and the cleavage and all that. 
[00:45:30]  Really?  She was a stereotypical French teacher.  Yes.  She had a big hairy bush, I bet.  She was a blonde.  Yeah.  And, yeah, she was something.  I bet it was a big matted down bush, though.  Yeah, that's all right.  I would have taken a look.  Oh, of course.  I had the stereotypical Italian teacher with a mustache.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she was smoking.  Yeah, but, all right, so then you're 16 or 17, you're banging the hot French teacher.  You're in a weird position.  You've got to tell people.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:46:00]  But if you just keep it to yourself, you've got the greatest thing going.  Yeah.  So what do you do?  Impossible.  You've got to shut up about it.  Impossible at that age.  I think that's impossible at that age.  Yeah, I really do.  All right.  No, I remember shutting up with Buzz.  Remember Buzz?  Yeah, yeah.  That chick that I was banging when I was in, like, fucking junior high.  But it wasn't a teacher, which is really off limits.  But it was, you know, she was an older woman for me.  She was, like, 19. 
[00:46:30]  And, yeah, I didn't.  Because somebody could have said something, and then there would have been a problem.  But weren't you dying to tell somebody?  How old were you?  You were 12 or 13?  I was, like, 13, yeah.  13, you're banging a 19-year-old?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, and it was just like that.  And you can't tell anyone?  No, I figured I'd just keep my mouth shut.  See, I would have told.  I would have had to brag to somebody.  Well, I did tell one person.  Who?  He wasn't impressed.  Oh, Richard?  Yeah.  Did he tell Richard?  Yeah, I told Gay Richard.  Oh, that bummed him out. 
[00:47:00]  That I was banging.  Yeah.  Do you remember what he said?  Um, he just changed the subject.  Really?  Yeah, he just changed the subject.  He didn't start making Bobby Kelly sounds.  Did he know he was gay at that point?  Uh, no.  That's at the point I didn't know he was gay.  Was that the first sign that he didn't like girls?  Wait a minute.  This just popped in my head now, too.  I do remember this.  Buzz, at one point, we were all hanging out drinking. 
[00:47:30]  Hit on Richard.  No, wanted both of us to go upstairs and fuck her.  Like, put her on the rotisserie and shit.  Why didn't he so he could take a peek at you naked?  I think the revulsion of a female form was so strong that even to fucking see the likes of me was just the worst.  How did he say no?  He was just like, no, no, no, no.  I don't. 
[00:48:00]  Hmm.  And it was weird.  And he always had girls chasing him around.  Because, you know, he was the good-looking kid and everything.  So girls were constantly chasing him around.  And I'm just fucking firing off every funny line and something, everything I could possibly do.  Get a little attention.  I'm learning how to make drinks like I'm in the movie Cocktail.  I'm just like anything I could do to get attention from these whores.  And they're chasing after him.  And little did they know, you know.  And he didn't want any of it.  He wanted nothing.  He didn't even go that way at all?  Not a hint of him ever liking a girl. 
[00:48:30]  He was not bi or anything.  He was completely homo.  Jesus.  Complete homo.  Does he realize what he was missing?  Smooth, wet vagina around his penis.  That's what I always think, man.  Do you realize what you're missing?  God, they're throwing themselves at you.  How stupid is that comment?  Throwing themselves at you.  I'm going to shake some of these gay guys.  Do you understand what you're missing? 
[00:49:00]  God, it's wonderful.  What are you doing with that anal opening?  The vag is great.  That's okay if it's your birthday, but jeez.  Like, you would think they'd give it a whirl.  It's like, you know, yeah, it fucking feels good on the cock.  So, you know, you give the old fucking.  It's truly made for the cock.  Yeah.  It's truly.  And, like, what's the deal where they would be, like, so, like, put off that they would not have sex with that wonderfulness that is the vagina? 
[00:49:30]  That's why you want to shake them.  Do you realize what you're missing?  Come on, gay guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's something.  Eh, well, yeah, so Richard didn't want to have sex with Buzz, but I did tell him.  But Buzz sounds like she was awful.  The name just, the visual I've had over the years.  The name was Christine.  She wasn't awful?  She didn't look like a Buzz?  Oh, no, she was pretty awful.  Uh, she, uh, she had a, a, a very kind of 70s voluptuous body. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, that's not bad.  But, uh, the face was, uh, rough.  You know what her face looked like for those people out there that are Twilight Zone fans?  Remember the episode where the old guy was dying on Mardi Gras?  Uh, and, um, he, he made his heirs, who were going to get his inheritance, wear these Mardi Gras masks for the whole night.  Or else they weren't going to get the inheritance. 
[00:50:30]  I vaguely remember this episode.  And at midnight, he knew at midnight he was going to die.  And after he died, he knew they would take the masks off.  Okay.  So, he, uh, made them wear the masks.  And they're all, this is stupid.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then midnight comes, he dies.  And they go, great, now he got his money.  Fuck him, he's dead.  They take the mask off.  And their faces looked like the masks they were wearing.  It, like, molded their faces into the mask.  So, they had to walk around all ugly and pig-faced. 
[00:51:00]  Buzz looked like the pig-faced mask.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, that sucks.  But she had a set of tits on her.  Oh, and she had youth on her side.  And an ass.  And a big, hairy bush.  I want to see what she looks like nowadays.  Oh, my God.  She has to go, you.  Do you like her?  Let me think.  I was about to say something really.  No, I don't even know her.  I would love to see a picture just to go, you fuck that.  She's probably an old battle axe now.  Oh, yeah.  She's got to be.  Let me think.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  You know how old she is.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Oh, God.  She was the go-to girl, though, with everybody.  Like, if you were horny and needed something, she was your go-to.  Oh, she was doing most of the neighborhood?  She was your go-to girl.  She was doing most of the boys.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't just you?  No, no.  Why would it just be me?  Wow.  See, she was going to, you know, do Richard.  I think she was doing...  Did your pops pop that?  Chato Reyes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think my pops might have popped her. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah?  Once, yeah.  Sharing broads with the pops.  Oh, my God.  I think.  God.  Yeah, I would say it had to have been.  That's kind of weird to share a broad with your dad.  Yeah, it was, you know, it was the 70s, Opie.  It was a different time.  Yeah.  Which...  Well, you had a young father, too.  I say that all the time, which means nothing.  Right.  Oh, it's a different time.  You had a young father, though, as well.  Yeah, yeah, you know.  He was only 20-some-odd years older than you, right?  Cowboy.  20 years older, something like that?  Was it?  Something like that.  Yeah, I guess so. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, he had me when he was, like, in his early 20s.  Jesus.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  Good old Buzz.  Buzzaboo.  Last I heard, I did get an update when I was out in California years ago from my father's  wife or widow, whatever the fuck you call it after that.  She said that Buzz went down to San Diego and married herself a sailor.  She went and married herself a sailor, and she's living down in San Diego. 
[00:53:00]  That's wonderful.  Good for you, Buzz.  Good for you, Buzz.  You go, Buzz!  I wonder if he walked in as she was blowing one of the local Capistrano townies and fucking  swept her off her feet like Officer and a Gentleman.  Right.  And fucking walked into his car.  You go, Buzz!  Yeah, there goes Buzz.  There it is.  Hey, Buzz, you were just sucking my cock. 
[00:53:30]  What happened?  Buzz, get back here.  I was just fucking you.  She's wearing the hat on her head.  There's jism in her hair.  That whore.  Stupid whore.  You think she listens to the show?  I don't know who's listening to this show in my past.  Yeah, some people from my past, I just wonder if they listen.  I know.  I wonder if ex-girlfriends listen.  I did get a Facebook message from an ex-girlfriend.  That one, that chick, Lisa, that had the father that called me my fine-feathered friend. 
[00:54:00]  Sure, yeah.  Yeah.  And she lives in Pennsylvania.  She's been married, kids, teacher, like the whole thing.  And I knew her when she was like 19.  I have an ex I would love to rub it in her face, in her mom's face.  Absolutely.  When I, fuck it, I'll say the town and everything.  When I was in Buffalo, I was really into this girl.  Yeah.  And the mom basically convinced this girl, where's he going in his life? 
[00:54:30]  You're not good enough.  Where's he going in his life?  I want, I want you to marry a rich guy.  Well, boy.  One of those.  And you know, I'm not a money guy.  I don't, I don't flaunt it or anything, but I would love to fucking just knock on the  door with my bank account and go, look what I fucking did.  What have you done with your life?  That never works.  And I heard she got really fat because I know a guy that was banging her when I was banging  her.  Oh, really?  And he, and they were supposedly only fucking friends.  But this guy came clean, uh, many years later when I saw him, where were we in Worcester 
[00:55:00]  doing one of those Viber shows?  Oh shit.  He told you he was fucking her at the same time.  Yeah.  And he was, he's on a TV show.  Oh really?  Yeah.  And I went, holy shit.  One of those home improvement shows.  I forgot which one now where they, they travel and they fucking, I don't know, make  your house better.  Fix the house up and then go.  Yeah.  I can show you the guy's, uh, uh, picture.  Damn.  And I ran into him.  I, I, I knew him from the old days.  We were both in Buffalo at the same time.  And I was, I guess I was supposedly going out with her and, and she was banging this 
[00:55:30]  guy too.  And I was so stupid and naive.  I remember going over her house, asking her mom, you know, where she is.  Oh, she's downstairs and she's sitting on, um, on the washing machine.  And the guy is pretty much right in front of her.  And I'm like, Oh, Hey guys, what's going on?  All like stupid.  And you know, it was going on like right before you came in.  Now I know.  Come on.  I'm not stupid now.  Oh, dude.  Oh.  And then if I ever questioned, Oh man, we're just friends.  Yeah.  Just friends.  But he gave me an update that she's a big fat pig now. 
[00:56:00]  And it made me very happy.  Very happy.  Cause she was also the one that after, after she didn't want me anymore, I started dating  other girls, but she didn't want me to date other girls.  Oh, that's, but she didn't want a great arrangement.  She didn't want me, but she didn't want me dating other girls.  Fuck her.  And, and that's a small, uh, that's a small city, that Buffalo.  So it got back to her.  I was seeing this girl.  So that's the one that left the, the voicemails.  Oh, right.  Having sex with her old boyfriend that she swore she was done with. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Some fucking cokehead that ended up dying by the way.  Oh, but they left, uh, lots of wonderful, wonderful recordings on my, uh, my machine as  they were having sex there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've told that story many times.  You gave the, you gave the recording to some of her family members.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Her grandfather.  And I swear I had this tape.  That's brutal.  I just can't find it.  Oh, I would love to hear that.  I've been, I've been searching for this tape off and on for years.  I can't find it. 
[00:57:00]  Maybe, maybe I don't have it anymore, but I have so many cassettes.  I'm thinking it's just not one of these cassettes, but yeah, I, uh, I left the, the messages  on her grandfather's machine and her mom's machine.  That's, that's a true story.  Absolutely fucking true.  That is great fucking payback.  So yeah, that, uh, that Lisa chick, the, the, she, she got in touch with me through  Facebook and was like, she goes, I didn't even, uh, cause wow.  I, and it was recently like the past year or something.  She goes, Oh, I never made the connection that you were Anthony. 
[00:57:30]  Oh really?  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  I've been doing this for fucking years.  You bitch.  Right.  You never realized that?  I want to go to Facebook just to, you know, get in touch with some of the, some of the, uh,  peeps.  Yeah.  Some of the peeps from the past.  Especially the ones that were just fucking horrible to me.  Some of that is just depressing.  I'm going to start knocking on some doors.  Knocking on doors.  Right.  You're going door to door.  Oh yeah.  Some of the girls that were so hot, you just go like, Oh God, no. 
[00:58:00]  Oh fucking father time.  You prick.  You insufferable prick.  Yeah.  Not good.  Yeah.  Just ate him up.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  No, no, no, no, no.  Opie and Anthony.  Patrice O'Neill.  Big mama prods on Twitter.  Your girls are tweeting.  I think they're Patrice.  She's making sure everyone's listening to you on the Opie and Anthony show.  She's a good girl.  What am I going to do? 
[00:58:30]  She's promoting your website, patriceoneal.com.  She's a good girl.  Big mama prods on Twitter.  She is a good girl.  I don't deserve her.  I don't deserve my girl.  She's a good girl.  I turned a hoe into a housewife, but she's a good girl.  She's a beautiful woman, man.  She really is.  She's better than I deserve.  She's definitely beautiful.  But she's still a cunt.  God, is she a cunt.  God, is she retarded.  She's insane.  She hates women.  She hates men.  That's every chick, though. 
[00:59:00]  But she's come to grips with it.  Yeah.  And she's a good goddamn girl, man.  I don't know.  You got to weigh out whether they're really good, and it compensates for how batshit crazy  they are, because every fucking girl I've ever known is crazy.  Do you know, between my marriage and my second one, I had like 10 or 14 years off, and I  see comics do girls are out of their mind, this and that, and I go, oh, please, you know,  really?  And then being with Bonnie, it's like you're going, really? 
[00:59:30]  That's why I said, really?  Really?  Really?  I'm trying.  Really?  You're yelling at me because I'm eating my dinner last night.  I ate the whole salad.  You're saying, calm down with my addictive behavior, because I ate my salad.  Who is this?  Bonnie.  They're just crazy.  It's crazy.  What did she say?  Well, I like to eat.  And she's like...  Let's get Bonnie on the phone.  He broke it down that all he was doing was eating a salad.  There was so much more going on.  Well, I was picking off their plates, too. 
[01:00:00]  After Patrice said what he said, I can't listen to anything you said.  Now I need the whole story.  Get Bonnie on the phone.  But it wasn't about a dumb little salad.  I'm going to tell you another thing Voss does.  These are things that...  This is about a salad.  If I get in a position, man, to help the friends I think deserve help, that one of us  make it, and we got to bring up the others that need help, it's going to be hard, but  I'm going to have to tell Voss, stop trying to be competitive in things that you have no  idea what to be competitive. 
[01:00:30]  But, like, me and...  We're having an off-air conversation, and we're talking about, like, how this whole...  You and Ant?  ...crew.  No, me and Voss.  Okay.  How the whole crew is kind of...  We're for real people with for real issues.  And there's a lot of up-and-coming dudes who think that they're gangster, but they're really  not.  And...  And...  But we...  We're old now.  Voss has to come in and just say his story, like, you know what I told a fucking... 
[01:01:00]  No, we're talking...  No, yeah, yeah.  Listen, when you say...  But it's not...  Let me finish this.  Let me finish this.  Let me finish.  Because you can dissect any fucking thing.  Hey, Ant?  Here's what we...  We did an overall us thing.  Right.  It was an overall...  Thanks, Ken.  Thanks, Ken.  We...  Overall us thing.  Yeah, it wasn't individuals.  It was the collective, right?  He comes in and goes, here's what I did.  Well, here's the bottom line.  Here's what I did to this bachelorette party. 
[01:01:30]  I told them, no, no, no, no.  Here's the thing.  We're talking...  We collectively are trying to be this family of fucking killers.  And he goes, I killed the best.  He always wants to kill.  No, no.  Here's what I did last week.  Here's what I realized, Patricia.  I have to fix that.  Now, here's the thing.  You guys have known each other for way too many years.  See, because, Patricia, but you are a better person than me on the outside.  But they don't know you like I know you.  You're crying on the inside.  I quit this. 
[01:02:00]  I quit that.  No, you've just been beaten.  I'm crying on the outside, too.  Like, that's what he's trying to do.  He's trying to psychologically break me down.  That's not what he...  That's not his forte.  Yes, it is.  I've been to it now.  I know enough about it.  The forte is, get him, Voss.  Go get him.  Go get him.  I don't want to break him down.  I just want him crying.  Go get him, Voss.  And Voss just goes, argh, argh.  Thank you.  And you go, down, Voss.  Down. 
[01:02:30]  And then somebody else tries to...  After he's chewed up, then someone else moves in and goes, this is what I tried to tell you.  Yeah.  This is...  You're not going to be able to do this now.  You don't want Voss to bite you and sick you again.  Shut up.  It's the phony edginess.  Or then the psychological hammer comes in.  Well, I know a lot about psychology.  Do you?  Do you see what I'm saying?  What do you do?  He doesn't.  I do.  You're wrong.  What do you know?  What do you know about it?  He's not interested in psychology.  Hold on.  You're 100% wrong.  What do you know about it?  I read, like, a couple fucking chapters in a Bradshaw book. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Give us some basics on psychology.  What do you want to know about it?  Anxiety?  Depression?  Do you want to know about it?  You can't list shit.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  That's a Chinese rule.  But you can't...  Hold on.  Ask me why a person does something.  It was from the And Dynasty.  Ask me why a person does something.  I'll tell you.  I want to just know the basics of psychology.  You said you know about it.  So let's start with psychology 101. 
[01:03:30]  Psychology for dummies.  Give me basic shit.  Here it is.  Basic shit.  Stop.  Basic shit.  Wait.  Let me answer the question.  Wait.  Let me just say to Opie what you're doing is not fair.  And I'm going to tell you why.  No.  Why?  Here's why I'm saying what I said earlier about he...  You see how much...  There's no one that can answer that.  Will you ask him a question?  I'm coming right now.  What's the basics of psychology?  Voss is so competitive and retarded at the same time that he doesn't understand that's  an impossible thing he's trying to get into. 
[01:04:00]  Well, didn't I just say give me something specific, but I won't give him...  That's fair enough.  It's very difficult to do that.  But look, slow down.  It isn't.  All right.  Go ahead.  First of all, I did say give me something specific.  But here's the basics.  There's no specifics to psychology.  Here's the basics.  Here's the basics.  All right.  It all breaks down on your inner child.  That's what it all breaks down on.  Okay?  As an adult, you cannot be abandoned.  As a child, you can.  And everything and how you react to situations is from your childhood. 
[01:04:30]  Basics.  There's a...  That's not...  Why are you saying that?  Because he asked me.  Why are you saying that?  But I don't think that's even true.  It is true.  It is true.  That's where every...  What are you talking about?  I'm talking about everything.  You just picked somebody, your asshole.  What's that?  You just decided to say it's all about your childhood.  Yes.  And then...  That's what...  That's what...  Yeah.  What's about your childhood?  Your...  What?  What behavior?  All your behavior comes from your fucking childhood. 
[01:05:00]  So if you're acting out, you're basically...  That's like saying all your...  You are acting out as a kid.  All your desire for water comes from first.  No, that's...  No.  You're right.  You're right.  He's a fucking asshole.  Listen, you fucking want.  He said the basics.  He said the basics.  That's the basics.  There's no...  Everybody has their own particular thing that you go...  So what's from their childhood?  Wait, wait, wait.  What if you have a fine average childhood, and then at 25 years old, you suffer trauma, 
[01:05:30]  you have a post-traumatic stress disorder, whatever, something happens.  That completely has nothing to do with childhood.  Can you explain to him what post-traumatic stress disorder is, by the way?  Doing a show with Rich.  That doesn't fall in the category of basics.  That is complete amazing.  All right, you asked for...  All right, I got one.  Okay.  Why are you, Rich Voss, so insecure? 
[01:06:00]  Why?  Psychologically speaking.  Because I didn't get enough reinforcement as a kid from my parents.  Why?  The stories you've told are terrific.  Blame it on your parents.  Terrific shit.  You just asked me, and I gave them an answer.  I didn't get enough type of fucking stories you tell.  What kind of stories?  Like the time your mom dragged it to your father's house and said, here, you take them.  I don't want them.  That was my grandparents.  I don't want them.  That's good reinforcement.  You have abandonment issues. 
[01:06:30]  That's why you're always like...  Why do I have insecure?  Because I come into this fucking battlefield, right?  And I get Twitters from the fucking fat listeners.  We're trying to build you off.  You fucking moron listeners.  They don't even get irony.  I fucking tweet.  I'm going on to O&A tomorrow.  I'm going to dress nice.  And these fucking morons, what does it matter?  You fat fucking listeners, go fucking die.  And because he needs the numbers, he won't block the... 
[01:07:00]  I do.  I block him.  You're wrong.  That's where you're wrong.  I block him.  I just learned how to block him.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with blocking people on Twitter.  Simple as that.  You hear what he added at that last...  I just learned how to.  A throwaway line.  I just learned how to.  But he didn't say he doesn't.  I just said I block people.  Rich, I blocked three people yesterday.  I'm on your side again because I followed you on Twitter yesterday.  And you did make a joke like I'm going O&A and I'm going to dress nice or something  like that.  Obviously, it's a silly, dumb, throwaway little joke.  No big deal. 
[01:07:30]  And people were answering him like he was serious.  They're fucking idiots.  Like, the other night...  Can't you pick up on the fact that it was a throwaway line?  The other night, they don't get it.  The other night at the show, this guy comes up.  He goes, you fucking killed her right on the radio.  Listen, I kill on the fucking radio, you morons.  I fucking 10 for 10 the last fucking...  This is a no-no-no.  You don't deal with it.  You don't deal with it.  I'll give you...  You don't deal with these fucking animals, these listeners.  Rich, they're my only fans, really.  Like, what do you mean?  I don't deal with them. 
[01:08:00]  Rich, I'll give you 8 out of 10.  That's still good, though.  Go over the fucking...  8 out of 10.  No.  10 out of 10.  Today was my slow stay.  I've seen ridiculous stuff written about Patrice on Twitter.  Huh?  I've seen ridiculous stuff written about Patrice on Twitter.  And did I spell anything wrong?  I got something for Rich.  I got something for Rich.  What?  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, Mommy.  This might help you.  Hi, Mommy.  This might help you.  Hi, Mommy.  This is for Rich.  Hi, Mommy.  This is for you.  I know I'm doing the same way, Mommy.  I love you, Mommy.  I've been wanting to see you for the past hours. 
[01:08:30]  It seems like everybody can.  Hi, Mommy.  I'm home.  I told you I was coming this year.  Hi.  This kid's so big, Rich, boss.  I got a haircut.  I love you, Mommy.  I love you, Chris.  Please don't disappoint me.  I'm not, Mommy.  She goes, I love you, too, son.  Please don't disappoint me.  That was the second thing after I love you.  And I've been praying, Mommy.  How's it going on?  I'll reset your headphones off. 
[01:09:00]  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, Mommy.  Why did that bother you?  Listen, listen, actually.  We're breaking down some psychology right now.  Here's the thing.  Why did that bother you?  I'm going to tell you real quick.  I broke the chain of dysfunction in my family.  That's all.  So did I.  Okay, I didn't say anything.  High five across the room.  Okay, I broke the chain of dysfunction.  Boom.  Me and you, brother.  I got, you know what?  Wait, what?  And I'm talking about both of you.  What?  You have to break the chain.  Dysfunction.  You, too, did?  Listen.  Yes.  Fuck yeah, I did.  You don't pay attention to me in my personal life. 
[01:09:30]  You don't know the first thing about me.  I got all my kids' first tooth that I pulled.  Her first haircut.  I got, Bonnie goes, why do you got your kids' first baby shoes?  Okay?  Because they were the first.  And they were, that's it.  Okay?  I went to, let's say my father's house.  I was doing a TV show years ago, and they needed a baby picture.  I go, do you got any pictures?  I mean, I think he had two.  Let me tell you what this show has done to Bob.  Okay.  Here comes Dr. Patrice.  And I don't blame him.  I don't fucking blame him.  It's such a war zone that a man who should be speaking much slower and clearer just rambles. 
[01:10:00]  Like, he's talking faster than his brain is able to.  I want to hear this.  Because you're like, you know what he doesn't have confidence in?  He doesn't have confidence in a point that might not have to be funny.  Yeah, yeah.  So if you say, if he says something about his kids' baby shoes, that's interesting.  Why do you save your kids' baby shoes?  Because your mom didn't save yours?  Who cares?  Because they're the first.  He says, why do you save, I was listening. 
[01:10:30]  Why do you save their first baby shoes?  Because they were the first.  And then he moves on.  And, like, you have to fucking explain yourself.  You two go, I broke the chain of blah, blah, and you gave an air high five to each other.  That's right, man.  And nobody knows what the fuck you're talking about.  That's because you're just fast.  You can't just say that.  Only fucking people that grew up in dysfunction understand that shit.  What the fuck are you talking about?  I'll tell you.  I broke the motherfucking chain of the shit. 
[01:11:00]  I broke the fucking chain of the shit.  Listen, Patrice, to get serious for a moment, I realized that my behavior, I was doing the  same fucking horse shit my mom did and her mom did to her.  And finally, you wake up one day and go, I'm going to do it different.  I'm going to break it down like this.  That's breaking the fucking chain.  I'll break it down so you understand.  In a black neighborhood, okay, a mom will have three.  Slow down for a second.  Okay.  This is where I grew up.  Can we promise not to cut Voss off?  Now, now, no one cut him off.  Can we promise?  Now, slow down and explain this. 
[01:11:30]  And this is where I grew up, so this is what I know.  And within 30 seconds, the wheels will fall off and go.  Because I'm going to tell you why.  He's going to pretend like this wasn't trying to be funny.  No, this is not being funny.  I want to hear you say a serious, slow story.  I'm going to tell you to break the chain of dysfunction, where I grew up and I used to  hang on Rudy's porch and hang out with Rudy and Peewee and his family.  And the rest of the fucking Fat Albert game.  Yes, yes.  He can't explain it.  Fucking asshole.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You hung out with Rudy on the porch.  Rudy and Peewee and the family.  And fucking Theo.  And fucking.  Okay. 
[01:12:00]  And Rufus.  And Claire.  I get it.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Okay, so.  And Mushmouth.  All right.  So the mom.  Voss, you like a school in June.  No class.  Go ahead.  I'm with you.  Go ahead, Voss.  Let it rip.  Let it rip.  And let's say one of the family members wasn't working and was getting government assistance.  Let's say.  Then the daughter grew up and saw her mom didn't have to work and had kids and got government  assistance.  So did she.  And then her kids grew up and got government assistance because her mother and grandmother 
[01:12:30]  did.  So one of the people, somebody in that chain has to break the dysfunction.  Do you know what I'm saying is that you shut the fuck up, baby.  But you're the worst.  Voss, on your side again.  You set fucking rich up.  Shut the fuck up. 
[01:13:00]  I don't want to hear you.  You really thought that Patrice wanted to hear this shit.  I did.  You set you up so bad.  What I'm saying is get a job.  What the fuck are you talking about, nigga?  Get a job.  Goddamn Patrice.  I'm getting chest pain.  I was trying to fucking listen to this bullshit.  I know.  You know what I'm saying.  The daughter broke the chain.  Because she got a job. 
[01:13:30]  The grandma.  The ma.  That she broke.  What is this fucking.  Didn't you know where that was going to, like, the second he started saying it?  Because it's so just Pat and.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  So one dad rapes his kid.  That kid rapes his kid.  Someone's going to have to stop raping.  Okay.  Is that easier?  Okay.  But we get it.  Dad was a drunk.  The kid was a drunk.  His kid was a drunk.  The next kid said, I'm not going to drink.  It's breaking the chain of dysfunction. 
[01:14:00]  This is a duck that doesn't fly.  Because his father flies.  And his father flies.  But I'm not going to fly.  I'm going to walk.  Okay.  It's the fucking dumbest shit.  It's the dumbest shit.  What are you fucking talking about?  Stupid.  But the question.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  He's up to us.  Kevin Patrice's fucking point that you're talking way too fast.  Take a breath.  Take a breath.  I know.  I'm getting a touch pain. 
[01:14:30]  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Please don't die in our studio.  Explain break the fucking chain of dysfunction.  What do you want?  E equals MC square?  It's easy.  It's pretty fucking self-explanatory.  I'm talking about breaking chains in front of Patrice.  That's not nice.  Yeah.  Okay.  Here we go.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Here's what the problem is.  Here's the issue.  It's self.  It's a self-awareness that breaks the chain.  Look.  Yeah.  Do I believe that kids should get beat? 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  I didn't like getting beat, right?  But I'm not going to say my mother's beatings.  Sometimes she hit me and it was fucking not necessary.  It was based on her youngness and it was based on not.  But did I deserve an ass whooping?  I used to be an arsonist.  I burned shit.  I didn't know this.  You had to call Bridges.  It continues to stay good, Trace.  But I tell you, that one was good.  That was good.  Let's analyze it. 
[01:15:30]  Let's analyze it.  Listen in that soul.  Don't worry.  Very good.  So he'll back it up with a bomb within 15 seconds.  Oh, because he's greedy.  Yes.  And he'll try to tell his story about, well, I was an arsonist.  There you go.  All right.  I burned and drowned things.  Like, he'll try to say something.  Go ahead.  You're trying to say something better than this.  All right.  Go after my handicap.  Go after my handicap.  Diet drinker.  Yeah.  See?  So I want to know about you being an arsonist. 
[01:16:00]  I used to just love watching shit burn.  A lot of us did when we were growing up.  But I burned, you know.  Did you go in the woods and burn some shit a little bit here and there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Then why was it a problem?  Hold on.  Why was it a problem?  Why was it a problem?  Yes.  Because I think a lot of kids go in the woods and burn some shit.  And hopefully it's a controlled fire.  I don't.  The psychology of why I like to see things burn, I don't know.  I enjoy burning shit.  But how bad did it get with you?  Like, Ann and I told our stories over the years.  Here's how it got bad.  We both had a fire in our childhood that got out of hand. 
[01:16:30]  But in general, it started little fires.  I burned a young, me and my mother, a young black woman's kitchen floor.  You and your mom burned it together?  No.  I burned it and tried to hide it with a rug.  That was, I burned, it was plastic floors.  Yeah.  No money to get it.  You know, if you fuck up your own house, the landlord ain't coming to fix your own burning.  No.  I burned up screens, like the screens, when you light the screens on fire, they didn't burn. 
[01:17:00]  What they did was just charred.  And then you could just poke your fingers through it.  I did that shit.  So I finally burned up the floor in the house.  You didn't have toys?  And my mother, yeah.  But my mother fucked me up so bad, that beating.  But, you know, at the time, I tease her about that beating.  But at the time, okay, I deserved that.  Because if my mother said, hey, man, you know, fires are bad.  And see, fires can kill and that's the bullshit.  I still, I'd be like, what the fuck's wrong with this ass? 
[01:17:30]  Is she telling me fires burn?  So she beat, what she did was beat fear into me.  So I had a healthy fear until I realized that what the fuck was I doing?  So she had to beat my ass to put the, for practical reasons.  Not to convince me that fucking fire was wrong.  She had to beat me because, because fucking, I just did it.  That if you did it again, you'd get that beating.  Yes, it was a practical fear.  It didn't stop you from wanting to burn shit.  So if she puts your face on the stove, would that have been okay too? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, because if, because somebody else's house would have been on fire.  Yeah.  I would have escalated to something.  You would have kept going, right?  Yes.  Absolutely.  A couple things.  When she beat you, did you feel like you could have taken her, but you had to take the beating  because psychologically you knew you were fucked if you didn't have her in your life?  The day I realized that half of it was fear was that when, 13, and she's called me and  I didn't come and she hit me with a broomstick in front of my friends. 
[01:18:30]  Oh shit.  And I realized it didn't hurt and then she realized that it didn't hurt.  That's a big moment.  And then she never hit me again.  So after that, every lesson I learned was on the job training because I didn't have a  father that could punch me in the chest.  There was no upgrade.  It was her mommy arms hitting me with a stick and I went, what?  That's what happened to my dad.  And I looked at her like, why would you do that?  Why would you do that?  In front of my friend?  What were you doing?  My friends are sitting here.  Oh shit.  And then that was it.  But I would never, it was never a threatening thing. 
[01:19:00]  It was like she realized her arm, it was done.  But it got me up to that fucking point.  I fucked up a lot after that, but she did what she can.  And I believe in ass beings because the problem with kids, my girl's kid, okay, she thinks  she has a say.  She thinks she's a human fucking being and she's not.  She's a thing.  She's a fucking thing.  And she should shut her fucking mouth.  But she always is like, I got a question though. 
[01:19:30]  And then why, but why?  Shh, be quiet.  Why?  Cause I fucking said so.  I was scared of every single adult when I was a kid.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Cause I thought they all had permission to punch me in the car.  And they pretty much did.  They did back then.  Yeah, but listen, you know what, back then, back then, you know what, that's fucking ridiculous  cause it's not, your kids do have this.  Now here's how, here's how why he don't think.  He started the whole thing where it's back as a child. 
[01:20:00]  That was his psychological profile.  Stop, no, right.  And now he just tells his name back then.  Now he just said fuck his own fucking theory.  No, no, no, no, no, listen, listen, listen, listen, you're saying, so you're saying, you're  right, it just started.  So you're saying a kid has no say in anything, then that's going to fuck the kid up when they  get older and they have no confidence because you didn't let them talk, okay?  If you're saying you are a thing and you're not allowed to fucking give an opinion or  a feeling, then that kid is going to grow up fucked up. 
[01:20:30]  That kid's going to grow up, first of all, your mom.  That kid's going to grow up not shooting up a school.  No, go ahead.  And your mom probably took it too far.  Cause I said don't shoot up a school.  No, no, you're saying you're a thing and you don't have a, you're my property.  The difference between you two is I think your mom took it too far.  No, no, no, no, no.  My mom took it too far.  You don't fucking get it.  You don't get it.  I do get it.  No, you don't get it.  Cause when you're saying your daughter, your girlfriend's daughter has not, you can't  don't shut the fuck up. 
[01:21:00]  Don't ask.  Don't tell.  You're a thing.  You just said you don't have, you're a thing.  I'm saying that for, for fucking an extra bit of a seasoning to this fucking adult radio  program.  But when she starts talking, I tell her, look, you listen up to a point because I'm telling  you to, because kids do not have the rationale to listen to you.  They don't understand shit.  You buy them something cause you're supposed to, you do this cause you're supposed to. 
[01:21:30]  If you go, look, go to sleep now.  Why do I have to go to sleep?  Because if you're tired, cause I fucking said so.  So true.  The fuck is wrong with you?  That's obvious.  That's why you only have girls too.  You just, you got weak sperm too.  You don't got no boy sperm.  You got little girls and shit.  Cause I pull out.  I like it on the chest.  I pulled out.  She put it back.  I don't want my son to go through what I went through. 
[01:22:00]  And I don't want, and I don't want, and I don't want no daughters.  He just broke the chains.  Cause my daughter probably, God will curse me.  And my daughter have 10 pussies.  On a shoulder and neck.  And they all work.  All being used at the same fucking time.  Just cause I've been so horrible to women and shit.  That's great.  Patrice, by the way, getting back to the arsonist thing, I always thought you were a good actor.  But I guess not.  Arrested Development, you played an arsonist.  Oh yeah, from the fucking...  See, I remember that fucking show. 
[01:22:30]  I love that fucking show.  And you were part of it.  What'd you burn down?  The banana stand?  The banana stand.  Oh yeah, my head.  Oh right.  Yep.  I don't know.  See, Rich, you bring up the early thing.  Yeah.  But then, it's not always about like...  You're right.  And we all grew up in that.  Cause some people have great childhoods and they become fucked up.  They become fucked up.  But we all grew up in that.  That is a joke.  Because they have great childhoods and no discipline.  And you saw Master and Commander with Russell Crowe?  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying, movie? 
[01:23:00]  That great scene when he had to talk to this guy?  Cause he's trying to be buddies with the fucking crew.  And Russell Crowe grabs him and goes,  They want a fucking leader.  They want a leader.  You can't fucking be friends with these motherfuckers.  You can't be buddy palsy wowsies with your fucking kids.  Cause they're abusive.  And they're naturally abusive.  They're not even manipulative.  They just go,  This punk, he lets me do anything.  No, that's wrong.  That's you.  All kids aren't like that. 
[01:23:30]  All kids are like that.  They are like that.  Are you pals to your daughters?  They're inherently abusive.  They're inherently abusive.  Do this.  And they will take advantage of every little thing.  No, that's human nature.  And until a kid has something to say.  That's fucking human nature.  That's worth fucking hearing.  I do like the shut the fuck up.  Yeah, right.  That's 25 years and above.  That's not a kid.  Anybody under 25 years.  When I thought I was being abused, as you grow up and you realize things, you go, wow, thanks, mom.  Thank you.  You did me a favor by fucking not letting, because I was smart enough to know what's right and wrong. 
[01:24:00]  Of course.  I just did it.  I just did it.  Yeah.  So I had to have some way to not do it.  You're the beating.  I like the Patrice mom, too.  I finally met her.  Yeah, she's cool.  She's a good lady, man.  She's all right.  Hey, listen.  This leads to the video that we wanted to play Friday.  I'd love to know where you were going to go, Voss.  Huh?  I'd love to know where you were going to go.  At the barbecue.  You were laughing.  You were going to get it.  Let me tell you what Voss said to my mother when he first met her. 
[01:24:30]  He said, you look like Roz G.  No, that was the first.  Roz G.  Voss said my mother looked like this big black girl comedian.  You look like Roz G.  That was the first time I met her.  That was the last barbecue.  That was the last barbecue.  Thank you.  But that's the charm of Roz G.  Oh, my God.  She sort of does.  Hey, can we play this video?  You fuck, nigga.  Patrice looks like Roz G.  I was too scared to go with that, but all right. 
[01:25:00]  Put a little wig on, Patrice.  Oh, shit.  It's not that.  I think that's you.  Why did I over myself?  And Danny's fucked up.  Everybody's fucked up on this show.  I wouldn't think to just look up Roz G.  That wasn't even in my mind to get a picture of Roz G.  You can get it up there fast enough.  You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony's Serious XM.  We've got Duff McKagan outside the studio. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, Duff.  Duff.  We should bring him in.  Yeah.  To join the program.  Certainly.  Come on in, Duff.  What's he been up to?  There he is.  What's up, Duff?  Duff.  It's been a while.  It's cold over here.  We're in the new studio.  How you been, man?  Good.  How are you?  Good, good.  Doing all right.  It's Louie C.K.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Nice to meet you.  You too.  Nice to meet you.  Yeah, Louie's a good guy.  We like Louie.  Yeah.  He's going to be dead soon, though.  No, no.  He'll soon.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Donald Rumsfeld is going to have him killed. 
[01:26:00]  We're calling him.  It might not be a good day.  He's a lizard.  Yeah.  You missed it.  You guys got one of the five interviews or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  We did real well, man.  I don't know how he got that.  Louie was suggesting he was a lizard, man.  He had no business calling this radio show.  No.  None.  So I really don't know how he got it.  I don't know.  I think.  Was that Roland that actually bullshit?  Bullshit.  Because Imus is mad.  Imus does politics.  You know.  Imus didn't get.  Imus didn't get Rummy Bullied.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Opinion, Anthony, got him. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  He's pissed off that we got him.  Uninvite him from my party.  So who else got him?  Austin, John Stewart.  John Stewart.  I think.  That's really it.  And then like the top whatever.  And then like, you know, the news channels.  The View.  He was on The View.  Like A View and maybe a Fox type thing.  He got the ladies on The View.  He got probably two Fox News.  But we got to the bottom of it.  Louis C.K. almost had him answer the question, are you a lizard?  Are you eating human flesh?  Are you a lizard?  Yeah.  Almost.  He came close. 
[01:27:00]  Did you?  And he refused to answer yes or no.  Of course he refused.  And now we're worried about Louis' safety.  Yeah.  Because he has never answered.  Rumsfeld insider.  One of the inner circle guys.  You better stay up on this floor and not leave maybe for a week.  No, I'm not going to be alone for a while.  Yeah, you are.  I'm not walking with you today.  I'll stay up on this floor until he mysteriously flies out a window.  Louis killed himself.  Man, he seemed so happy.  I saw him shot in the gymnasium at the Pentagon.  Sitting alone in a wheelchair. 
[01:27:30]  I saw Louis in Times Square.  Someone poked him with an umbrella.  An umbrella?  Very strange.  Months later.  And his body was full of salt water.  Right.  And he was in the desert.  It was weird.  Yeah.  Very strange.  What happened?  Very strange.  Very strange.  Tattoo that he didn't used to have.  Oh, well.  Whatever.  And then we'll go, oh, well.  He'll be missed.  His spleen is gone.  His spleen is gone and there's no sign of surgery.  No sign of surgery.  We found a scale next to him.  A couple of scales and scratches.  Is this your guy's way of catching me up on the show? 
[01:28:00]  Oh, sorry.  We're lost.  Sorry.  Yeah.  I apologize.  Don't worry about it.  What's going on today?  What's Qaddafi doing and all that stuff?  He's still defiant, I guess you'd call it.  Oh, he's defiant.  Yes, he's defiant.  I think he's trying to kill as many of his people as he can.  Before he gets killed.  Yeah, he gets out.  It's like a stratego or something.  Yeah, what do you think about that whole thing?  The Middle East revolting in general.  You know, I guess my only comment, I have the column for the Seattle Weekly. 
[01:28:30]  And I got an email from a girl, an American girl who's married to an Egyptian guy.  So this was a couple weeks ago.  And they were in the square.  And the girl's from Seattle.  But she lives there.  And her letter highlighted what a day-to-day life is like there and how much people make  a day and how much bread and gasoline is.  And she wasn't really commenting either way. 
[01:29:00]  She was just, this is our reality.  We need to change.  And it's kind of, you know, I played, my only experience really, I played in Israel and I  played in Dubai.  And I played in Dubai about three years ago at the Desert Rock Festival.  They're really trying to do like a rock festival.  And the kids, they come from Iraq, Iran, Egypt, India, and they're starved for rock and roll.  And kids rock, kids are just kids. 
[01:29:30]  And, you know, there's 20-something-year-olds.  And they want rock.  And they want to talk.  And they want to exchange ideas.  And very, very eye-opening to see, you know, I mean, traveling in Iraq, you see that people  are just people wherever you go.  And the people aren't necessarily their government.  You know, just like, you know, me touring.  I wasn't one of Bush's cronies.  You know, when I... 
[01:30:00]  I was.  I'm a free thinker.  And there's a lot of free thinkers around the world.  So, I guess these...  I don't know.  You know, my take is that the young youth of those areas are just a little sick and tired  of it.  Yeah, but you know what?  You throw the leaders out, and then the youth isn't in charge of who gets put in next.  Well, no.  That's the problem.  It's Donald Rumsfeld.  Right.  Rumsfeld will decide.  He's deciding right now.  No, he's cloning a pot of himself to go there now. 
[01:30:30]  He's brewing up some sort of, yeah, dictator stew over there.  One of his lizard friends will be in the office over there.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Now, the way...  The youth can't...  Sorry to keep digressing, but...  And when you asked him about the primaries and stuff, he said, you can see how their brains  work, and you can study them.  He said that about learning about the candidates.  You can see how their brains work.  He probably literally has, like, seen their brains working.  Dissect them.  Open them up.  Yeah.  Sorry.  We're very... 
[01:31:00]  It was just really fucked up to have that powerful a guy.  We've never had a guy like that on our show.  No offense to you and Louie and everybody else, but that's a powerful guy.  Yeah.  He's had people killed.  Well, how...  Have you ever had people killed, Duff?  Naturally.  Naturally.  Of course.  Come on.  So how do I follow up, Donald Rumsfeld?  It's not the best spot for you.  How about...  How about throw a curveball in there and ask you a couple of things about the stock market?  Stock market?  Yeah.  You invest a lot? 
[01:31:30]  Are you bullish or bearish right about now?  I'm kind of neither right now.  Yeah.  I mean, I take positions and I hold them.  Oh, you're a hold guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I think we talked about this before.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're much more of a...  You're an active...  Yeah.  I'm not an hour-by-hour buying ticks kind of guy, but I'll hold for anywhere from a few  days to a month.  You made a move yesterday, though.  So, yeah, yeah.  I made a great move yesterday. 
[01:32:00]  Why don't you tell Duff your move?  What's your move?  I bought some...  Let's do this move.  I bought some Apple call options right before it tanked.  Oh, well...  Oops.  Yeah.  Oops.  I see it coming back, but...  You know, the market's been down a couple of days in a row here.  I buy gold coins.  Oh, you're a gold guy.  Gold coins.  Yeah.  I've seen Louis do this.  It's very fascinating.  The ones on TV?  You got some on?  The ones on TV.  Do you carry Krugerrands with you?  I carry one gold coin for when the shit hits the fan. 
[01:32:30]  At least you...  Oh, for when the shit hits the fan!  So you can get a taxi or something.  I've got one gold coin.  That is great.  I've got one ounce of gold on me at all times.  I shouldn't be telling this to people.  Right.  Why am I saying this?  I won't do it.  I am always carrying an ounce of gold.  You really don't like your life.  If you hit me on the head, it's worth it.  Guaranteed at least $1,400.  I'm getting the impression...  It's Canadian.  And I'm getting the impression Louis doesn't like his life.  Yeah, I know.  Well, that's a Canadian...  Asking Rumsfeld if he's a lizard and carrying around gold coins, that means... 
[01:33:00]  What about heavy gold?  I know some...  Heavy, right?  No, gold coins are nice.  Gold is nice and heavy.  You slam it down.  Hey, man, give me a good farthing of whatever.  Farthing!  It's a real...  Give me a satchel of...  That bit is great, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Payment, vague payment payments.  That's what made me start liking gold coins.  Yeah, well, that's a good thing to have, especially in this day and age.  The world I come from, you know, it was so...  Especially in my 20s, it was so sort of insane.  And rock and roll is so up and down.  And there's enough chaos and rollercoaster-ness in rock and roll. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  That...  And, you know, I'm the last eight kids.  My parents grew up in the Depression.  And so I learned a lot.  I heard the stories.  I heard the...  You know, I just kind of learned the lessons.  And there's enough chaos in my life that I really found, when I went back to school in  my 30s, at business school, that I was really like...  That rule of sevens for me, 7% every seven years, do you double your money.  That really stuck for me. 
[01:34:00]  So I don't...  I'm really non-aggressive.  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't lose any sleep.  And I hold positions.  I held through the whole 2008.  Yeah, all that...  You know, when that tanked, yeah, and everybody...  Put it all in, you know, take it all out and put it...  Just leave it.  Don't look at every statement like it's...  Now, your problem, Anthony, is that you're a blackjack player.  Yes.  And the problem with blackjack players, if you just sit there and win $25 every hand, 
[01:34:30]  then you're going to be a millionaire if you're just patient.  That's great.  And when you lose, you're only going to lose $25.  But you start thinking that you're good at blackjack.  It's like casino.  If you win three hands, you think it's due to your eminence on Earth.  Right.  Of course.  So you go, fuck it, $10,000 hand.  I'm like, I don't consider it winning $25.  I consider it losing $9,975.  Right.  He's been known to do that, Doc.  Because he didn't bet that.  He's done some pretty crazy hands.  I've done crazy hands. 
[01:35:00]  But you've done okay.  You're pretty smart about that.  I'm not...  You know what?  Here's what people don't understand.  I think I was until last time out.  Wow.  By the way, go to the Borgata.  Enjoy the Anthony Cumia wing that they've installed there when you go see Louis C.K. at the Borgata.  Wow.  No, it was a biggie.  How much did you lose, will you tell me?  I don't talk...  I'll tell you off the air.  Okay.  But I don't like talking figures on the air.  Because, you know...  I understand.  Right there. 
[01:35:30]  The guys like that.  Imagine if I answered that question.  Yeah, that to me...  To me, answering that is like him answering the lizard question.  Yes.  I just won't do it.  But, uh...  You see, I don't think a lot of people understand.  I don't think a lot of people understand.  I don't think a lot of people say anything like, uh...  I'm...  What are you doing, Don?  Donald?  What do you call him, Don?  Mr. Rumsfeld, I was calling him.  Could have you should have called him Mr. Secretary.  Are you...  Did you say anything like, are you pimping your book?  Is that where...  Was he pimping his book?  Is that what's going on?  No, I was...  He's trying to sell books.  I was saying that his book is fantastic, even though I have not read it yet. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But, uh, I looked at the pictures.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  And I even read some of the words under the pictures.  Is there any, like, childhood pictures?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  His little egg.  They have a picture of him when he was just in his egg.  You know when he was just an egg in the...  In the sands?  Yeah, in the sand.  Is it buried in the sand?  In the sands of Mars?  In the red sand of Mars when he was an egg.  No, there really is no childhood pictures.  When he was an egg in the sands of Mars 6,000 years ago. 
[01:36:30]  He should have put some pictures.  He's got pictures?  It went up all as a child, right?  You know, childhood pictures would have made it more endearing, right?  Yeah, when he was a teenager in Mesopotamia.  This is my, uh, yeah, fashion faux pas when I was 16, you know?  Yeah, something like that.  You know, way back.  When the hell was he born?  How old is he?  Uh, he says 78, I think.  Yeah.  What are we promoting today?  What brings you to New York? 
[01:37:00]  Well, I have, uh, The Loaded has a record coming out.  Oh, right on.  Um, uh, April 19th.  It's called The Taking.  We're making a movie.  Really?  For it.  It's pretty damn hilarious.  Right.  Yeah.  Our drummer gets kidnapped.  Take your show.  And it all happens in one day, and, uh, uh, it's a madcap, uh, comedy.  Well, of course.  Of course.  But it's, it's really, oh, thank you.  Coffee delivered.  Yeah.  Starbucks.  You guys do it all.  We're not happy with Starbucks.  This is real good.  He, he remembers when Starbucks literally was a local fucking, right? 
[01:37:30]  When it was a Pike Street, when it was a cool thing for a minute, right?  There was, you remember when there was one.  At the market.  Yeah.  Pike Place Market.  Uh, so.  And at the time, they had to compete with all, a bunch of other kids with their own, like,  little coffee kiosks.  There was more, those kiosks on the streets they used to have.  There was one, there was the, the one under the, the monorail.  That's the original, yeah, sort of walk-up.  Um, no, that wasn't before Starbucks, but, uh, there was just like a lot of little coffee  I remember that.  We should ask Kim, because we. 
[01:38:00]  Are you from Seattle?  No, but.  I used to play, I do stand-up, so I played there a lot in my youth.  But we should, there's a couple of shitty comedy clubs there.  We should ask him.  They were shitty.  You know, Giggles, I don't know if you ever.  I played Giggles.  Yeah.  Now, you know what it just turned into?  What?  Jiggles.  It's a, it's a strip club.  Really?  Are they just Giggles to Jiggles?  They just had to change a letter.  It was very inexpensive.  That's really sad about comedy.  I don't know why, because.  One letter away from the fucking strip club.  I think that place did pretty well with comedy.  Giggles was there for years, and I worked for one guy who owned it, and, uh, I came, 
[01:38:30]  I was a young comic then, and I was headlining.  And I did, the first show was Tuesday.  You had to work, like, Tuesday through Sunday then.  And so I did the Tuesday night show, and then Wednesday morning he woke me up in my hotel  like at 6 a.m., and he says, uh, how do you feel it went last night?  Wow.  And I said, I thought I did pretty good.  He goes, I didn't feel that the audience respected you at all.  Wow.  At 6 a.m.  He did this.  Yeah.  And I said, what are you talking about?  He goes, you don't wear a jacket.  You're on stage in a t-shirt.  What the fuck? 
[01:39:00]  I want you to wear a jacket the rest of the week.  Wow.  And I said, I don't wear a jacket.  I don't own one.  I'm certainly not traveling with one.  So why don't I take you to the store today and buy, and you buy a jacket, and I'll take  it out of your check, and then your shows will go better.  And I said, listen.  A jacket is going to.  He said that.  And I said, listen, I'm not going to go to the show, to the store with you.  I'm not going to buy a jacket.  So just tell me now if I've got to get on the plane and go home.  Because I'm not, this whole line of questioning, I'm not doing this.  Yeah, this is just awful.  Either put up with me or send me home. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  And it was, all right.  You should have worn a jacket, but fine.  What was the 6 a.m. thing about it?  How do you call me at 6 a.m.?  That's when he wakes up.  He was obsessed.  Yeah.  He was up all night.  Fucking comic wasn't wearing a jacket.  Let's fast forward for Duff.  Wow.  Louie played Carnegie Hall recently in a black, shitty t-shirt.  Yeah.  So what did that guy know?  That's right.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry to say shit, but I'm not.  Black t-shirt and jeans, no.  It was just a black t-shirt and jeans.  No one gave a shit, because the guy was hilarious and got a standing ovation at the end.  Yeah, and that guy. 
[01:40:00]  So what did that guy know?  Oh, with a stupid jacket.  His club's now jiggles.  That's right.  Look where he's at.  That's right.  Right.  Well, he's probably looking at...  Duff, can we ask you something?  Because we were talking about this earlier now.  You remember when Starbucks was one store, we were talking about corporate America squeezing  everyone out, especially like a Starbucks is squeezing out all the local coffee guys.  Are you seeing that even in Seattle?  No, the Northwest in general, like Seattle and Portland.  Have you seen Portlandia yet?  No, I haven't seen it.  You've heard about it.  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  What kind of genius?  That's what I heard.  It's funny.  It's a show on like IFC, and it's a, you have to see it.  It kind of takes the piss out of the preciousness of like Portland and Seattle, but more Portland.  But no, there's still like little independent coffee roasters all over the place in Seattle.  In Seattle, Starbucks is looked at as sort of like, oh, really?  You went to Starbucks when you could have went to Stumptown or Zoka coffee roaster, you know? 
[01:41:00]  So you guys are hanging in there because the rest of America is being taken over by Starbucks.  That's the point.  But it's convenient.  I mean, I don't really, it's, Starbucks is fine.  It is huge in corporate, yes, but you can get it anywhere in the world.  And that's the problem, man.  Man, man, man, I'm kind of losing that edge, you know?  Oh, yes.  All right.  But, you know, I mean. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, but do you only want to go to Starbucks?  I mean, wouldn't you like to think, man, when I used to go to Chicago, there's this one coffee place, you know, McG's, and they always had Ethiopian somewhere or other.  But now it's just a Starbucks.  No, no, I will seek out, there's a great little coffee place on 6th and 54th or 55th or something here in town.  I don't care.  There's a lot of good little coffee places, and I will seek it out.  Yeah, I seek it out, too.  If I'm up here.  But a lot of places, Starbucks kills those.  They kill them. 
[01:42:00]  They predatorily kill them.  No, no, there is that.  They will strategically put their stores in places, of course.  Yeah.  But I don't know where we're going with this.  Starbucks is taking, you know, when BP.  Yeah, we're doing the whole corporate thing.  That's where we're going.  I mean, that kind of, the BP and the sort of passing the buck thing happened.  Now that I made some money on. 
[01:42:30]  BP.  Yeah.  BP went down because, you know, little ducks were fucking.  Ducks were being all coated in oil.  Well, by opportunity.  Well, by the way, I have a different view about that because a lot of people called it an oil spill.  That's what they were calling it.  Like it's an oil spill.  They like to think that a corporation created toxic oil and poured it into the Gulf.  Yeah, that's what people like to tell themselves, that a Texas American corporation. 
[01:43:00]  But oil is fucking dead pine trees and all kinds of.  It's just, it's a natural mineral that's beneath the earth that leaked out by a British corporation that was trying to get it.  Yeah, it's, but it's, it's the earth shitting in its own mouth.  It's not, it's all natural and animals died and greed was the cause of it.  But it wasn't, it's, it's natural.  Yeah, it is a natural thing.  It's a bubbling, it's like getting mad at a volcano in a way. 
[01:43:30]  Ah, ah, lava, yeah.  It's like getting mad at a volcano and you go, well, human beings made it the volcano erupt.  Well, human beings are just like animals.  We're just like.  We're just here fucking around.  No, we're like yeast that eats sugar and shits alcohol.  We eat oil and shit smoke.  I mean, it's just something that we do.  If you pulled back like an anthropologist or even just biologist, you'd say these bugs burrow into the ground and, and, and sop up the oil. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  It's like if beavers move into your area, the water goes up.  The water goes up.  Nobody gets mad at that.  Nobody calls the beavers fucking Republicans.  But here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  BP.  BP didn't shit in their own mouth.  They shit in the Gulf of Mexico's mouth.  Yeah, and by the way, it's the Gulf of Mexico.  Like, nobody even gives a shit how the Mexicans feel about it.  Like, it's a thing that America suffered for.  And Mexico's like, yeah, you know, we're not nuts about it either.  They're busy in a drug war right now. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, they're having a big drug war down there.  And I don't know.  But it's all, you know.  I, I, I just decided it was a great time to buy British petroleum stock.  And it went up.  It started going back up after, after they realized,  I bought it when it was still leaking.  And the second they capped that thing and was, and did the test,  and it's like, well, it's capped.  Ding, ding, ding.  It ticked up.  I sold out.  And I'm like, I'm counting my oily fucking Pelican money.  My hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, pelican money.  Pelican money.  It was fantastic. 
[01:45:00]  No, and by the way, that's what people like to think, that it's all cleaned and it's been capped.  Go buy BP again.  Of course, it's just as bad.  There's like wafting weird black jellyfish of oil now roaming the Gulf.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just kind of killing creatures.  Killing things.  I know a couple of my buddies are two of the guys on the Northwestern that deadliest catch crab boat.  And they say, even now, crabbing up in the Bering Sea. 
[01:45:30]  They get Valdez oil that they run into.  Still.  Still.  Yeah, like a foot thick.  Wow.  They'll pull up some pots.  They're just coated.  Wow.  Yeah, it's still in there.  Makes them real tasty, though.  The crabs.  Oh, yeah.  That oil seeps in the crab legs.  Nice and moist.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Nothing better.  Wow.  Duff's like, God bless those guys because those king crab legs are great.  They are.  They are.  Fantastic.  And then you watch the show and you're like, God, I really got to appreciate when I eat these 
[01:46:00]  because people are literally dying.  Actually, what's his name?  One of the guys died.  Justin Tennyson.  They found him in a hotel.  Found him in a hotel.  Hope that's the guy you knew, Duff.  No.  Oh.  Yeah, he was.  One of the guys, they found him in a hotel room.  A kid.  Yeah.  Which ship was it?  Which one of the boats was the one?  He was on the Captain Phil's boat.  Yeah.  Was it Captain Phil's boat?  The, uh.  Yeah.  I don't even remember.  Shit.  I had to get a second ago.  You know, that's all sort of close to home, all that stuff.  That was great. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, I would imagine.  Yeah.  I like that.  So, Loaded has a record coming out in April.  We're going to play South by Southwest in a couple weeks down in Austin, which is a really  killer, great event, and, uh, we have a, we have a new record company that's just completely  excited about this.  Oh, sorry.  I was just laughing.  Louie found out how much I lost and said I could have set up a scholarship fund that  would have lasted generations.  He could have done that with the money he lost in Atlantic City.  Wait, are you touching him? 
[01:47:00]  Generation.  What's that?  No, I wrote that.  No, he wrote it down.  Because I asked him to tell me how much he lost, and so he wrote it down for me.  Oh, yeah, I wrote it down for me.  And I could have affected an entire generation.  No, he would have had people, like, getting choked up when they said your name.  Yeah, yeah.  Because of what opportunities you created for them.  Instead of me spitting on the floor, walking away from the table.  Where, to me, is the big hole in all of your conservative politics.  Because I've heard you say, I listen to the show all the time, you know, when I'm not,  I go, when I'm shooting my show, we start working at 7 in the morning. 
[01:47:30]  I'm always listening.  Turn on the show.  Yeah.  And I always hear you saying stuff about, like, if I have to pay more taxes, then I  won't pay a worker to fix my house.  Right.  Like, if you don't let me have all my money, I won't be able to afford other Americans.  I can't hire people.  But it's such bullshit, because if your taxes go up, that's not what curtails your spending.  What curtails your spending is losing a shocking amount of money playing blackjack.  But that's part of my enjoyment.  And that's what most Americans, their taxes aren't their real burden. 
[01:48:00]  It's their fucking own stupid, retarded spending.  Right.  And their wife is like, where's the heating?  You know, should we pay the gardener now?  And they get a cold sweat.  Oh, fuck.  I bought a fucking Stretch Armstrong for $6,000 on eBay.  But that's my decision with my money.  Yes.  Not the government's decision with my money.  Yes, but you don't get to say that the government made you not pay a contractor by raising your taxes. 
[01:48:30]  They make me pay money.  You throw your money away.  Actually, me and Opie had to talk about this, and I want to set the record straight as far as this whole tax thing goes with me.  It's not even so much paying the taxes.  I understand it.  We eat it.  We all have to fucking do it.  Yeah.  And I'm not going to be like, oh, my God, I can't do something because I'm overtaxed.  I despise watching anyone on the news and whatever saying that the rich, the wealthy, where I fall into that category, aren't doing their part. 
[01:49:00]  Well, who says that?  Every fucking Democrat and liberal is saying, well, the rich have to do their part.  I've been doing my fucking part for years.  I've never heard of that either.  Oh, please.  That's what you hear.  Please.  That's what you hear.  You're like, you know what you're like?  And this is what conservatives are like.  They're like paranoid girlfriends.  Yeah.  Where if you say, I'm not crazy about how you said that. 
[01:49:30]  Why did you just call me a cunt?  What?  I didn't call you a cunt.  No, that is a direct.  I just asked you to treat me a little bit.  There are direct quotes from people saying that the rich, the wealthy have to do their part.  They're not doing their part.  They need to do more.  They're getting too many breaks, whatever.  And when I write a check to pay my taxes, I'm thinking.  Do you really sign the check?  I'm thinking.  Yeah, I actually do.  Do you write them out and sign them?  Are they pre-written?  I write them out.  Really?  It sucks. 
[01:50:00]  Yes.  I write them out.  You don't have an accountant?  Yeah, but he doesn't write them out.  I just sign them.  He just tells me how much.  I don't even sign them.  He tells me how much.  I don't even sign them.  Really?  That's brilliant.  Until they rip you off.  That's why I'm a liberal.  You're going to be so fucked one day.  They're going to rip you off one day, though.  You're going to sign your own checks.  I know.  It's worth it.  It's been...  I've stored away enough years where he hasn't fucked me.  If Billy Joel could get fucked, Louis C.K.K.  Dane.  Dane's own brother fucked him over.  Billy Joel's what?  Brother-in-law, was it?  Yeah.  I've been with my guy since 90-something. 
[01:50:30]  One day he's going to realize that he's not doing well.  At this point, he kind of deserves it.  You know, there was a guy...  He takes my money.  He kind of deserves it.  He floated me for many years.  There was like...  I remember one year where I was like, can I...  Like, I got...  I can't.  Come on.  I want to buy one of those.  And he was fighting me over something I wanted to buy.  Oh, wow.  And he kind of politely blurted out, you know, you haven't paid me in a year.  Oh, shit.  I don't take money anymore.  Because you're barely alive.  The partners of the firm have told me to dump you several times. 
[01:51:00]  Wow.  Good point.  Stop telling me you want to buy a fucking, you know, Rolex when we haven't taken our 2% in a year, you asshole.  So at this point, if he rips me off, he's got it coming.  There are people that were with Bernie Madoff for like 17 years and longer.  Sure, 17 good years.  And 17 great years.  Yeah.  And then just got fucked.  That's right.  So, you know, I guess anybody is capable.  Would you take that deal?  17 amazing years.  17 good years and then fucked.  Amazing, amazing years.  It all depends on how old you are when that ends. 
[01:51:30]  That's true.  You know what, it's a pretty good deal for the victims.  Because they're not much better off than he is in terms of, they fucking did the same dumb corrupt thing.  They just, their crimes they didn't care or want to ask.  Right.  But he gets to be the lightning rod.  He goes to jail and they get to go, oh, and start again.  At least they get to start again and they're free.  Start over again, they're free.  Yeah.  But he goes to jail.  You got to think a lot of those guys kind of knew something wasn't right.  Something was up.  You got to think that.  Definitely.  Hey, I got one question for Duff. 
[01:52:00]  One GNR question.  And I apologize ahead of time because I try not to ask you guys the GNR questions anymore.  Because Slash goes, oh man, come on.  But there is like a weird rumor.  Well, as long as you're still doing the Super Bowl and playing, you know, playing the one riff and then going back down on the riser.  Slash had a good gig.  And then he needs to answer the question.  He did have a good gig at the Super Bowl.  Came up, played that one riff.  And then back down to some quiet room with an intern.  Am I done?  He goes back under the field and there's some bored-looking Texan kid there. 
[01:52:30]  Can you imagine?  I think that's it on his headset.  Yeah, I think that's it.  You can go home.  You're done.  I think that was the easiest money anybody ever heard.  There is a rumor of a...  And also, by the way, it might not have been Slash.  I mean, he's got that hat.  And I'm not even saying that they faked Slash.  I mean, the Slash could have sent a...  Like, you want to do that for me?  Yeah, I'll give you $12,000. 
[01:53:00]  Go do it for me.  There's no money in playing the Super Bowl.  Oh, really?  No, no, it's just a...  Just an honor?  Yeah, they pay all expenses and whatnot.  Yeah, and it's sort of just like...  I didn't know that.  ...promote your thing.  Your project.  Well, there is a rumor the NFL is trying to get you guys together, the actual Guns N' Roses together.  To play at halftime?  Yeah, the funniest thing was...  Is that a real...  I mean, you've heard that rumor by now, right?  Yeah, I heard it in my own house.  My wife comes to me. 
[01:53:30]  She goes,  Honey, the NFL is trying to get you guys...  You know, they're getting you guys back together for next year.  I said, Sue, baby.  Really?  She goes, yeah, it's on the internet.  I'm like, honey, you're talking to me.  Hey, break away from the internet and get back to reality.  No, but it's right here on TMZ.  Yeah, exactly.  No, you don't know yet, because it's on...  You don't want to look at TMZ.  That's our culture, though.  It's hilarious.  She's living with the guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have to break the...  Cut the thing.  Actually, turn your head away from the machine. 
[01:54:00]  It's me.  Look at the person that you're talking about.  You can trust me, and you can trust me what I have to say about this.  14 years together, you know, we're good.  Wow.  So, no, it's just rumor and wild rumor.  I remember when Guns N' Roses broke, and I was in high school, and I was a senior, and  the kids, freshmen and sophomores, started listening to Guns N' Roses.  Guns N' Roses is the first band that I had the experience of saying, what are the young  kids listening to?  Like, I was a senior, but I was like, what is that? 
[01:54:30]  Because I didn't know any...  Me and my friends were listening to Led Zeppelin, and Van Halen was, like, where we were at.  But, and then, freshmen and sophomores that had weird haircuts and were kind of fucked  up, and they were listening to this Guns N' Roses, and I was like, what the fuck is  that?  Like, it was so different to me.  It was way above everything else out.  It was so from the gut.  Like, you could hear every string of the fucking guitars.  Like, they just...  It was such tightly wound.  But I went nuts for it.  I loved it.  Everybody was freaked out. 
[01:55:00]  I remember that, yeah.  It really is rare when...  Because rock and roll, especially by the 80s already, was such a fucking oversaturated...  Every color of the spectrum's out there.  To have a sound that people go...  That shakes everybody, you know?  Yeah.  It rarely happens.  And it's weird to be...  I mean, for me, you know, to be sort of, you know, to be inside of the thing and not  being able to experience it from anywhere else.  You're not getting to be a Guns N' Roses fan.  You didn't get to be a... 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, I mean, you have to be a fan.  Like, Slash, you know, at this...  You know, it's so sort of iconic in some circles.  Like, Slash's top hat could have come up on that pedestal.  And people would have went crazy, you know?  Exactly.  People would have not even him in it.  That's how big the deal is.  Just that.  So it went from us being, like, you know, kind of street urchins.  Right.  Really, it was a band from the gutter.  And five guys, that's all we had was music, nothing else.  And it was that or kill somebody, really. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's like the Beatles coming out of Hamburg.  Like, that's what made them great was playing in the rough rooms.  We have beer thrown at you.  Yeah, yeah.  You're wearing leather because it's actually protecting you.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, the thought that they were tough guys back when they were actually in Liverpool.  No, and the L.A. scene was such a...  I mean, it was dangerous just because how strung out everybody was.  It was like it was hard to just survive.  Yeah.  And these guys found this, I don't know, you just tune into this frequency.  Yeah, I played this one note.  I moved to Hollywood in September of 84. 
[01:56:30]  And there was the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 84.  September, the Olympics were over.  So I guess what happened was the cops had cleaned up Hollywood,  pushed everybody out, the hookers and the drugs and all that stuff.  And there must have been some events in Hollywood.  But I came right as the cops let down all the barriers.  Oh, let everybody come back in.  And the floodgates were open.  And I had no idea.  I was 19 years old. 
[01:57:00]  And it was just dangerous.  I didn't live in a high-risk neighborhood.  I lived in kind of the drags of Hollywood.  And it was for real.  I mean, it was on.  It was dangerous.  There was ghetto birds over my apartment every night.  Helicopters.  Okay.  You know, there was a time where you drove down Sunset and you had this feeling like,  if I get out of my car, I could get killed and nobody will find me for a while.  Really?  That bad? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, it just seemed shitty and seedy.  And by the way, they came out of there.  And they became one of them playing the Super Bowl for five seconds.  That only happened, again, going back to our fucking earlier conversation, because of record stores in the 80s.  Because some record store owner in Indianapolis said, this sounds fucking hot.  I think this will move if I put it out there.  And that's why he was able to come from the gutter up to mainstream, was through that system.  It's like a septic system or something. 
[01:58:00]  And now, if you've got to go directly from your playing it to iTunes, you have to go right to mainstream.  There's no coming up as much anymore.  I was living in Rochester, and we got Appetite from some guy in Arizona.  It wasn't available yet.  People were just kind of trading it around.  I don't even know if it was a bootleg.  I'm not even sure.  That's why the reason it excited me was because I haven't heard this, and I don't know where these fucking kids got it.  It absolutely wasn't in my local record store, something that the kids at the time were just passing around. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, the freshmen and sophomores in my school got it at the record store in Harvard Square.  And then they obviously changed the cover, because you had controversy about the cover, right, if I remember?  And then it was in every record store in America.  But at first, when I discovered you guys, it was because some dude fucking mailed it to us from Arizona.  Yeah, that record was out for a good year.  Before it hit.  Yeah, and they were about to pull us off.  See, and that's because the record store is like Louisville.  Yeah, because the record had legs, because it was given some time to seep out through the system.  And people went, what are those fucking kids that I'm a little afraid of listening to? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, I think I'm too old now.  But Guns N' Roses and Nirvana, when I heard those two fucking bands for the first time, I was like, holy shit, what is going on?  And I haven't had that feeling since.  But then again, I'm getting older, so maybe it's passed me by.  Yeah, well, there is.  I mean, I think there's sort of a disconnect now with younger bands coming up.  And I have a feeling something's going to happen.  But you're right.  There hasn't been that one band. 
[01:59:30]  That wow moment.  Maybe there has been.  But I'm in another world now.  Yeah, I haven't heard it about it.  But I can't really think of one off the top of my head that could have been Guns N' Roses and Nirvana.  And then who was next after that?  Yeah, everyone's just still waiting for whatever Black Eyed Peas wants to do.  Like there isn't that kind of like Darwinist thing in the music right now.  Where somebody else comes around and goes, forget everything you've ever heard.  This is now.  Right.  So, okay, listen. 
[02:00:00]  Joke for all ages here.  You know why Tigger bounces on his tail?  Because he's a cunt.  So he doesn't step on Pooh.  That's not working?  I don't think you're winning awards for that either.  Really?  I had some good jokes last time I was on here.  That one was not so good.  How come Louie was trying to do music and Duff's trying to do comedy?  No, check it out.  That really isn't working out well.  Two lesbian frogs are sitting on a lily pad.  And the one lesbian frog looks at the other one and goes, you know what? 
[02:00:30]  We really do taste like chicken.  This is my joke.  Louie's just nodding.  I can't respond to jokes usually.  That was kind of a respectful nod that gave me.  I'm not sure it works, though.  I don't get it.  I like your Kung Fu.  Louie, pick up a guitar and show him how that feels.  I respect that very much.  Show him how that feels.  See how that felt?  That's this.  I'm just fucking done. 
[02:01:00]  That's hysterical.  You know, music, hitting a chord that people remember is such a fucking powerful.  I was at the Knicks game last night with Chris Rock.  I don't want to brag on everybody.  You just did.  We were at the game and they're playing all this music, you know, all kinds of rock and  roll and stuff.  And we were thinking about, like, I forget one of the songs.  What's the song you hear at the fucking...  Always Ozzy Osbourne.  Used to be Gary Clutter.  Yeah.  And then we were thinking, like, there's been comics who have written jokes that are as  good as some of these songs, but they fucking evaporate. 
[02:01:30]  They don't...  You can't just go over and over.  Nobody plays Steve Martin saying, excuse me, after a slam dunk.  That'd be good.  And excuse me was pretty phenomenal.  That could be good, though.  You might have started a trend today.  You know, they could do it after a foul called on a hometown guy.  Tell me about the game.  I don't...  What happened?  That guy Carmelo was great.  I know all about that, yeah.  Yeah, so Melo was there playing.  He was great.  He was great.  Duff's a big sports fan.  They played the Bucs.  The Bucs, yeah.  I mean the Bucs.  They're not...  You know, they should have beat them.  Bucs can beat anybody at any given time. 
[02:02:00]  Sure.  But Duff's not an NBA fan anymore.  Well, here's the deal.  I'm from Seattle.  And they lost their team.  Yeah, that sucks.  Our team, yeah.  How did Seattle lose their team?  How did you allow that to happen?  It was not unlike the Cleveland Browns thing.  Right.  From back in the day.  Yeah.  It was horrible.  It was the middle of the night type of thing.  Yeah, but I think some teams, like, you know, Green Bay still has Lambeau Field.  They're still operating the same way they always did.  I mean, whenever you start buying massive stadiums and needing a bigger and bigger profit margin to stay alive, it's easy to tumble. 
[02:02:30]  Like, teams that have stayed in weird towns, like Portland or whatever, it's because they just sort of just keep doing the same thing.  When they start overgrowing, I think, is when it's like...  Why was it criminal for the Seattle Super Bowl?  Well, okay, so Howard Schultz, the CEO of...  By the way, we're going to acknowledge you do have to go, but I just want to hear this answer, and then we'll get you out.  Okay, so Howard Schultz owned the team.  He's CEO of Starbucks. 
[02:03:00]  I think he had some whatever health problems, and it was too much of a burden for him to have the Sonics.  So Clay Bennett, who, when there was the hurricane in New Orleans, went up to Oklahoma City and played during that half of the season.  Remember that?  Yeah, yeah.  Clay Bennett was sort of this guy, this mover and shaker in Oklahoma City, Stern's, like, best friend.  So all of a sudden, Clay Bennett's up.  I'll buy the Sonics.  Well, there was a thing in the contract that he could move the team. 
[02:03:30]  Howard Schultz hadn't played.  You can't move the team if you're going to buy.  You can buy, but you can't move.  Yeah, and he bought the team and moved them.  So there was lawsuits and all that stuff.  But, you know, of course, the fans, we don't care about skyboxes and luxury suites.  We just want our team, you know?  And it was really pretty sad.  That's pretty sad.  Yeah, so it didn't matter.  It's like in Harvard Square.  There used to be a place called the Tasty Diner that was there since, like, the 40s. 
[02:04:00]  And the company that eventually sold the building to Abercrombie bought the building and said that we're going to tear down the Tasty and everything in it.  And so everybody started defending the Tasty, and it was a big movement.  And somebody found out that George Washington had an office in the building.  Oh, shit.  And so they said, so it got put on the National Register.  You can't tear this down because it was a historic building, and everybody celebrated.  And so the company that bought the building figured out, what happens when you tear down a building? 
[02:04:30]  You don't go to jail.  You don't go to the electric chair.  Right.  You get fined, what, fucking $200,000?  Half what you fucking probably, theoretically lost in a blackjack table.  Fuck it.  Fuck George Washington is the, uh...  Fuck it.  Is what I just learned.  So then they just go, fuck it.  Just pay it.  Holy shit.  Tear it down, pay the fine.  Wow.  And by the way, the building is no longer national. 
[02:05:00]  It ain't anymore.  Yeah.  And they ripped it down.  They ripped it down.  So that's what that guy did.  He's like, it says I can't move the Seattle, out of Seattle, or else what?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we'll be awful mad at you.  You nailed it.  Duff, you really got to go.  They're begging us to take trade you out of here.  I don't know.  You must have a busy schedule.  And, uh...  Yeah.  And next time you're in New York, we want you to play.  Last time you played, it was awesome.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, this was good.  Trust me.  I liked it.  But we'd like to, you know, see you play a little bit.  In my jokes, I should have brought a little stronger.  No, you were fine.  Stronger jokes. 
[02:05:30]  I was going to think about it.  You were in Guns N' Roses.  Don't worry about it.  You're fine.  No, you don't have to.  No, but you just mess it on in my morning forte.  I'm just a shitty shock jock.  Don't worry about it.  No.  You're fine.  No.  Your legacy is set, okay?  Okay.  Now, Dov McKagan, good friend of the show.  Great to meet you.  Thanks for the music.  All right.  You're welcome.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Thanks, Dov.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  You guys suck.  Sirius X.  Tony Iommi is making his way into the studio.  Legend.  Fuck yeah, legend.  Here he comes right now. 
[02:06:00]  Tony.  Hey, how are you?  What's up, Tony?  How are you doing, man?  Hello.  Oh, I didn't know you were here today.  How are you?  Yeah, yeah.  Welcome to the show, man.  Bill Burr, to your right, Tony.  How are you?  Very funny, man.  Nice to meet you.  I can't believe I'm sitting next to you.  That's rock royalty.  Huh?  No, no, no.  I won't make it weird.  I won't make it weird.  Don't worry about it.  Is this your first interview of the day?  Yes, it is.  I hope so.  It's early.  First one.  First one.  You're known for hating getting up in the morning.  Me?  No, I get up in the morning. 
[02:06:30]  I love it in the morning.  I get up.  Do you really?  Yeah.  We try to get you in one time.  They're like, no, he doesn't like getting up in the morning.  Good excuse.  When I'm at home, I'm at about 20 past six in the morning.  That's not early for you a lot, but it's early for you.  No, it is.  It's early.  We have to be here.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I obviously read the book.  I loved it.  You start the book talking about, like, on the first page, you're working in a factory.  You're going to quit.  And your mother says, nah, go back. 
[02:07:00]  Finish out the day.  It's the right thing to do.  And can you describe the rest of the day?  Because you were about to walk out.  The rest of the day was awful.  Um, yes.  Uh, I went back after lunchtime and they put me on this machine that was, um, a press,  really, that bent metal, because I used to do welding, electric welding.  And so I had to bend the metal myself and then weld it, basically.  And just this one, I was on it a couple of hours. 
[02:07:30]  It was fine.  And then suddenly, bang, the thing came down on my hand as I was pushing the metal in.  Whoa.  And it just squashed the ends of the fingers, basically.  And as I pulled my hand back, I pulled them off.  Oof.  How much finger did you lose on the, because you're a lefty, so on the right hand.  Yeah.  Well, I lost, you know, a fair bit off that, off the two middle joints.  And they, they embed, they planted the nail again, put that back in.  So now you, this happens, you're already playing guitar. 
[02:08:00]  I was playing guitar, yeah.  I was playing, I was about to leave that day to turn professional with, and go to Germany with a band.  Oh, my God.  What went through your head?  You just went, it's over.  Oh, that was it.  I mean, that's why I was finishing the work.  And I thought, well, yeah, next week I'm off to Germany.  And it all went very wrong, you know.  How long did it take for you to that, to heal and even to begin?  Did you immediately lose hope or were you looking down going, maybe?  No, I sort of got, that's it, you know, it finished. 
[02:08:30]  And, of course, I saw different doctors and they said, oh, forget it, you know, you'll never play again.  That was their attitude, not, we'll do something for you.  Did you consider playing right-handed?  Maybe you could strum or anything?  I know, I think it did, funny enough, because it seemed like then I'd been playing a long time left-handed,  which wasn't that long now.  Right, right, right.  But at the time, it seemed like, you know, three years seemed a long time.  Wow.  How long was it before you picked up a guitar again?  But, um, I tried, even though I was banded, so it's not that long. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, wow, right away.  So I was trying to play.  And I did learn to play more with my two outside fingers.  Wow.  That's a hell of a story.  A hell of a way to start a book.  Yeah.  No, just the fact he was going to quit that day.  I know, right?  No, stick it out.  Yeah, stick it out.  It's good, great.  Yeah, I just couldn't believe it.  I just couldn't believe it, after all the things that my mom, of course, my mom obviously  felt really bad then, because she sort of made me go back to work.  Well, I love your mom, because without that terrible mood, there'd be no Sabbath. 
[02:09:30]  That's the greatest thing, because you would have been off with that other band, so it's  kind of great for me that that happened.  Well, it sort of made me create a different sort of style of playing.  What was that other band?  Did they ever become anyone?  No, I don't think so.  Any of the players, even, move on to other bands?  I don't know.  Wow.  I don't know.  I never actually stayed into it.  I just got the job with them, and I didn't really know them that well.  How did it change what you did on the guitar, which kind of gave you the sound that made  Sabbath what they were? 
[02:10:00]  I just had to work on it, and work on getting the height of the strings right for me, the  gauge of the strings, of course, because they were all heavy gauge strings in them days,  and I come up with an idea of light gauge strings.  And I made my own set out of banjo strings, and I went to companies to see if they'd make  them.  They said, well, they won't work.  You'll never be able to work.  Use them.  And I said, well, they do.  I'll use them.  No, they'll never sell.  So that was all these downers as you're going on, you know, you're never going to do any 
[02:10:30]  good.  That will never work.  And I just kept going.  A lot of supportive people.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  But I love, like, his generation where it's like, well, then to hell with that.  I'll just make my own.  Like, nobody from my generation would just be like, forget it.  I'll get a job in a cubicle, and that'll just be the end of it.  You made everything.  I mean, I made my own gauge strings.  I made my own thimbles to play, because it was all said that it couldn't be done.  Can you describe the thimbles?  How do you make guitar strings? 
[02:11:00]  Well, I didn't make the guitar strings.  Oh, that's what you're saying.  I made the setup.  Oh, the setup.  I used banjo strings as the first strings.  And then I used different gauges to drop down so they were lighter for me.  But there was no actual, you couldn't actually go and buy a set of strings like that in those days.  And you had to, can you describe what you had to do with the thimbles so you could actually play?  I got a fairy liquid bottle and melted it down into a ball.  And I got a soldering iron and just sort of heated it up and melted the inside of the ball. 
[02:11:30]  And then I, so it fit over the finger.  And which took a long time, you know, before it fit.  And it was sore.  And I just sat there for days just rubbing, rubbing it down to make a shape of a finger.  And then, of course, it wouldn't, I couldn't play with it because it'd slip off the string.  So I had to find a material that would grip the string so I could bend them and stuff.  And at the end of the day, it became, it was leather.  And it was from my old 70s leather jacket that I had. 
[02:12:00]  I cut it to bits to use the leather and I couldn't find anything else that would work.  So you made, basically, you cut, you had your fingers cut off.  You made your own fingers.  Holy shit.  Yeah, and I still use, it's still the same thing today.  I know they make them for me now, but it's still the same.  It's still a very Heath Robinson job, you know.  You still using the same jacket, you said, too, in the book?  Or you had it for many years?  The same jackets to use for the thimbles, yeah. 
[02:12:30]  I've got a small piece left now.  Cut it to bits over the, I mean, well.  Over the years, yeah.  Of course the years.  It's a lot of love in time, isn't it?  Damn.  So did that change the way you actually, because the sound you came, what was the sound you  made?  Because, like, metal didn't exist.  And it's just like that gong or whatever.  That's a terrible impression of a Sabbath sound.  I like it.  I like it.  That was good.  A gong.  It was more of a fucking gong that you'd hit.  Well, that probably was.  Yeah, it was.  It sort of made me approach the guitar a lot differently, because I had to come up with 
[02:13:00]  chords and come up with a way that would suit me to create a bigger sound.  Because I couldn't play the regular chords, because it just wasn't possible.  Now, you guys, I was surprised to read, too.  I mean, I've met all of you, and you're all the nicest guys.  I was amazed at how violent you guys were kind of coming up.  There was quite a bit of fighting, and some really violent shit happened. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, it did, yeah.  But where we were from in them days, that area was fairly rough, and the school we went  to, Ozzy and myself went to the same school.  I don't know what that means, but we did.  And it was very rough, you know.  So you took martial arts.  I was surprised to learn that.  Do you still practice them?  No, not anymore.  I'm too old for that now.  But no, I did it for a while, and I enjoyed it at school, you know, and then when I left school,  but when I took up the guitar, it sort of dwindled off then. 
[02:14:00]  Of the guys in the band, who was probably the biggest problem in a bar fight?  Problem?  Yeah, who was the one in Sabbath that would fucking knock your teeth out first?  Well, it was usually me.  Oh, really?  Because I'd, you know, they'd either call for me, oh, we've got a problem here, and I'd  be, you know, but in them days, you didn't have security people and all that sort of stuff,  you know.  You sort of fended for yourself.  Well, you couldn't afford it.  You were a friend for yourself, weren't you? 
[02:14:30]  Well, you guys were broke, too.  Like, I mean, it's like you hear about people paying their dues and, you know, and fighting  their way through poverty.  And it's like, did Bill Ward, like, can you describe the drumsticks he used to fucking  play with?  Yeah, he used to.  It's funny, because we'd be playing on this show with another band, and then Bill would  be floating around afterwards, picking up the broken sticks, you know, of the other  drummer, because he used to use, and he got used to playing these half sticks.  Oh, no. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, no.  Come on.  We didn't have the money to buy, you know, drumsticks or anything, really.  So Bill sort of, again, got a style of playing with these little half sticks.  This level of drive is unbelievable.  And he would just stab them into his hands and duct tape them, and he would just play,  and that's just what you did back then.  Like, the level of toughness from that generation is amazing.  Bill, how many times would you have quit at this point?  Oh.  Just so many.  I would have felt sorry for myself at the factory. 
[02:15:30]  The finger thing, I would have been out.  I would have been a secretary.  Made them give me a job as a secretary for life.  That's cool to hear, though.  Certainly with his kids and stuff.  I mean, it was, we worked hard to get everything, so he wouldn't let anybody play it.  And there was always a case that John Bonham used to come with us, because he was a friend  of mine, and he used to come with us to some of the gigs, and he'd say, can I have a go,  Bill?  And Bill would go, no.  Because Bill let him get up and play one day, and Bonham, of course, broke his snare. 
[02:16:00]  So it didn't go down very well at all.  How fucking funny is that?  Bonham can't touch my shit because he breaks it every time he plays.  I heard that was like a thing with him, when he would sit in and he would try to demolish  the kit, like when it was over.  Yeah, well, he wouldn't demolish it.  It was just that he was a heavy drummer and rocking a real mean drummer Bonham.  And so it didn't last in bands very long up until Zeppelin.  Did you know he was going to make it the first time you saw him play?  Not really, no. 
[02:16:30]  But it was just such a, the bands he would be in would be in, he'd be in a band for probably  two weeks, and then he'd get fired because he was too loud.  That's great.  Yeah.  It's all Zeppelin.  That's the time he really kept the job a long time.  Right, and that was another thing where you'd think he'd be like, well, I keep getting fired.  Maybe I should lighten it up a little bit.  And he's just like, nah, to hell with this.  This is what I do until I find people who get it.  The great thing was he used to have the drum case and he'd have the name of the latest  band on his drum case. 
[02:17:00]  And it was getting smaller and smaller because he couldn't fit them all.  And they crossed out the next last one he wanted, you know.  And you remained friends with him up until he passed away.  He was the best man at your wedding?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was a good mate.  We used to go out in clubs and, you know, most of the time I'd end up driving because  he'd get paralytic.  And I'd be on the way, but, you know.  On the way, yeah.  Did he encourage you to drink the night before your wedding or did he think that sobriety 
[02:17:30]  was probably the best?  Oh, dear.  Did he encourage me?  Well, as I said in the book, we went out, just the two of us and a driver, thank goodness.  And we went to different clubs.  And we went to this last club about, I don't know, 10 to 2 in the morning.  And it was closed at 2.  And Bonham goes in and he goes to the barman.  12 bottles of champagne, all open.  He went, yes, sir.  So he had 12 glasses there and 12 bottles all filled up. 
[02:18:00]  And he went, go on.  I went, what?  Go on.  Drink them.  I went, I'm not going to drink them.  He says, you've got to drink them.  I'm open now.  I said, I can't.  I said, if I drink all them, I'm going to get married tomorrow.  What's going to happen?  And he went, ugh.  And he went down and just drank the lot.  And within half an hour, he was just paralytic.  And of course, we had to take him home then. 
[02:18:30]  And his wife wouldn't let him in when we got home.  She said, he's not coming in like that.  Please.  She's shouting out the window.  He's not coming in.  Please let him in.  You know, I'm getting married in the morning.  He's got to be there.  Well, he's not coming in.  And eventually, please let him in.  So she came down.  He can come in, but he's not coming to bed.  He's going to sleep down there.  So we put him up against the radiator in the hallway like this.  Drop him up?  Yeah.  And I said, you're not going to make it tomorrow, are you? 
[02:19:00]  He went, ugh.  Put his thumb up, you know.  I went, oh, okay.  And sure enough, the next morning, he was bright and breezy.  And he lives probably 30 miles from me.  And I saw him coming up the drive.  And I'd just got up.  And he's all dressed up and coming up the drive.  He just sort of got that recovery rate.  He could be fine.  He's one of those guys that could fucking function the next day.  I envy that.  I didn't feel too good, but he was fine.  How many times have you been married? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, God.  Three times.  Four times.  This is the fourth.  This is your fourth?  Wow.  I've given up now.  Yeah, this is the last time.  I've decided this is it.  Damn.  Four times.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Like, after one time or two times, you figure that would be the end of it.  But you used to fuck it and you went for a couple of...  Yeah.  Yeah, what was it like that in the moment in that third one where you're like, oh, no,  not this again.  This is just coming down.  I thought I had this figured out.  Yeah.  Also, I've got a complex thing and it must be me. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  I don't really...  After three times, you've got to be like, all right, maybe I need to...  Maybe I've got to adjust some things.  Yeah.  What was their biggest complaint about you?  From who?  From, like, the wives.  What was the women's biggest complaint?  Well, certainly the problem from my first marriage.  And that was great, really, that marriage.  But I was never there.  I was always on tour or in the studio.  And what sort of got up her back was when she saw...  When I was in the studio mixing the album and everybody had gone away on holiday. 
[02:20:30]  And she'd come, well, everybody else has gone on holiday with the wives.  And you were in the studio.  And I know.  I mean, that was...  I couldn't look at her.  Someone had to do it.  Isn't it amazing how fucking women, they just...  It's like...  Even the fucking Sabbath.  And they complain.  There's no making them fucking happy.  Honestly.  They want to live in the great big houses.  But what you've got to do to get the great big houses, they fucking complain about it.  You would have made a great wife.  I never would have complained if I was married to you.  Ever.  I just would have listened to your music. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, I don't know.  I'm out of here.  I wouldn't want anything in the divorce.  Just a few signed records.  I'm fucking perfect.  Yeah, you must be thinking that at some point.  It was a complaint.  Just be like, did she realize that it takes a little bit of work to keep 80,000 people  happy at night, you know?  Yeah, I suppose.  But the thing is, when she sees everybody else going away on holiday, it looks like,  oh, well, he didn't want to take me away.  I suppose that's what it was, you know.  It's that competitive thing.  They all do it.  They all make it about themselves.  It's just what women do. 
[02:21:30]  They do.  They have to be a victim.  They can't go over there.  I'm happy to be here.  They've got to somehow turn around.  I love this.  Jimmy's making me feel like I'm liberal when it comes to this.  This is great.  Go, Jimmy.  Go.  Yeah, but Tony understands.  It's the way it is.  It's like, you know, this great life you provide for somebody, and they get pissed off  at the way you have to provide it.  Yeah.  Do you have to remix every night?  Yeah.  By the way, speaking of remixing, the biggest hit I think Sabbath commercially had was movie  Power and Ride, I guess.  At least the one that got the most airplay. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  And how, what was that?  That must have been a couple of months to put that song together.  Paranoid?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  A couple of days.  What, the whole album?  No, just the song.  No, a couple of minutes to do that.  That actual track took, you know, probably three and a half minutes for me, as long as  it is, really.  We didn't really, I just put the idea down.  Everybody came back from lunch.  I was in the studio, and they, I sort of got this riff, because we needed a filler for 
[02:22:30]  the album.  They said, we need one more song.  That was the filler?  Filler.  Yeah.  That's great.  We need one more song, and it needs to be probably three minutes.  I went, we'd never done a three-minute song.  You know, we were always like seven minutes and eight minutes.  God.  So I just put this idea, played this riff, and when everybody got back from the pub or  wherever they'd been, I said, well, I've got this idea, and let's try and put it  down.  And that's what we did.  Did they react to it, like that's awesome?  Oh, they liked it, yeah.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  I thought, well, that's kind of catchy.  Well, also, they probably liked it, because we didn't have anything else, and then we 
[02:23:00]  had to have one more song.  It's ironic, really.  That was the quickest thing to do, and that's the one that sort of probably got more airplays  than anything.  I heard that song on the subway platform yesterday, on the flute.  Paranoid on the flute?  Swear to God.  It's just weird that Tony's here today.  An old lady.  You didn't notice me.  Old lady just playing Paranoid on the flute.  Do you know what the great part would be if you went down and got her and sued her?  She was making money off your song yesterday, Tony, if you want to report her. 
[02:23:30]  She did a very good job, and then she went into Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star after that.  And I have to ask, too, because it's, everyone, there's all this, I was just going to ask  if we could hang out later.  The answer's the same.  No.  Everybody wants to know, there's all this news leaked about Sabbath has been talking,  they haven't been talking.  Can you just tell us, or tell me, even if it's whispering, where is Sabbath status right 
[02:24:00]  now?  Whisper it.  All right.  Um, well, you know, we're all on talking terms, and we all, I see myself, I've been  talking for a long time anyway.  And, um, and of course, geese.  But, um, it's, it's coming on.  We'll see what happens.  You know, you can never say never, it's going to happen, it's not going to happen, because  all the times that people think, oh, it's going to happen, it's going to happen, and 
[02:24:30]  it doesn't, then it's let down.  So I, I really don't know, it's, let's hope, you know.  But you're, you're open for the idea of possibly doing some new material with the, with the  guys.  I'm open for, you know, it'd be nice to, uh, to do something with the, the old lineup.  What happened to the six songs?  You guys did six songs, like, uh, what was it, like, I want to say 98, or 97, or 99.  I mean, I could just name every fucking year.  Just keep going.  I'll hit the nail on the head if I name 20.  I, uh, sold them.  Just piece of stuff.  I love how Joey does that. 
[02:25:00]  But I just caught myself.  I'm like, was it 94, 95, 97?  Stop me when I hit it.  What a terrible interviewer.  Yeah, well, we did do those songs, and, uh, they sort of just, like, a lot of things  get put in the box, and you go back to them another 20 years' time, I suppose.  But you still have them, so if you wanted to do new material, you wouldn't have to.  I still have them, but, uh, I don't think, uh, we'd use them.  Oh, you wouldn't use them? 
[02:25:30]  I wouldn't think.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did Ozzy really have no shoes?  Because he said that in interviews, I had no shoes on my feet, and you described, you  said that he would just walk around barefoot.  He did walk around barefoot.  He didn't have a, none of us had a lot of anything.  And the one particular time we were going on tour, when we were going on a tour of Europe,  and we went around to pick Ozzy up in the van, because I used to drive, and he came out  with a, one of those wire coat hangers with a T-shirt on and a pair of jeans, and I said, 
[02:26:00]  well, is that it?  He says, yeah.  I said, well, we're going away for six or seven weeks.  He went, I know.  I went, oh, I know.  And that was it.  And yeah, he wouldn't, he, well, after a night, he only wouldn't have shoes, or he didn't.  That's just the greatest.  And I'm going to plug the book, too.  It's, uh, Tony's been promoting the book.  Of course.  And, I mean, I'm an, obviously, I'm a Sabbath fanatic, but I, the book, if you're not a  Sabbath fan, I know, I try to keep that under my hat.  You really do.  You do well.  Yeah, once in a while, I try to be fair, um, uh, it's called, obviously, Tony Iommi, 
[02:26:30]  Iron Man, My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath, and it's a real biography.  It's a, it's a, you know, like a 370-page biography.  It's, I, I, I thought I knew everything about Sabbath, but there's a tremendous amount of  things that I learned, um, and to me, the most shocking stuff was all the fucking fighting.  Um, I'm going to give a couple of plugs for the signings, too.  The book ends in Ridgewood, New Jersey.  Tomorrow night, which I think is when the book comes out, from 6 to 8 p.m., that's the  independent store in Ridgewood.  Book review in Huntington, Long Island, which is a 7 o'clock on Wednesday, and you can stop 
[02:27:00]  off at FH Riley's and have a snack.  St. Vitas Bar.  My restaurant out there.  Yeah, this is a restaurant.  We'll take care of it, if you want to know.  St. Vitas Bar in Greenpoint, from 3 to 4 p.m. on Thursday in the Barnes & Noble in Tribeca,  here in the city.  It's going to be 6 o'clock on Thursday, so Tony is doing 2 on the Thursday.  You know, uh, you know, I love going through the pictures.  I, I need to know just a little bit about the rocking Chevrolettes from 1964. 
[02:27:30]  Wow.  I don't even know.  Well, obviously, uh, extremely different than, uh, what you did with Sabbath.  Well, it was rock and roll, then, sort of thing.  Was it, like, um, yeah.  Rockabilly?  What kind of?  No, no, uh, more sort of Chuck Berry type stuff.  Chuck Berry, okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's so weird, this face.  Hey, the question I wanted to ask was, after you, you, you had your accident at the factory,  okay, so now you're saying you can't make, you know, the chords the way you could.  Did that change who your influences were as a guitar player, or did you just? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, it's, uh, that's where I first got to hear of Django Reinhardt, because he had,  you know, he had problems, of course, with his two fingers.  And so that sort of really inspired me to, to hear his stuff and hear him play and how good  he was.  That's, uh, that still blows me away.  Yeah.  It's incredible, like, I, the amount of people that would have stopped.  Yeah, there's another thing you could have brought up to one of your ex-wives.  You know, you think if this didn't stop me, your bitching is going to stop me? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Shut up, enjoy the ride.  Yeah.  How many tickets could you sell at a ground round?  Are you serious right now?  It is, it is amazing.  Go, go tell that to all your shoes.  To have, to have to make your own, especially, like.  Make your own finger?  Make your, especially.  That just amazes me.  What's this called, the hand that you do this with, and I'm making the fret hand?  The other hand, it would have been a little bit easier, right?  Or at least less inconvenient. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  If it had been the other hand, it would have been, well, I shouldn't say no problem, but  it would have, wouldn't have stopped me from, I'd have been able to play the usual way.  Yeah, the other hand's a little more of the business hand.  Just the fact that you can't, you can't feel the string now.  That's crazy.  There's something else in between there, and you're still able to come up with that.  It's just, that's unbelievable.  It is, it's weird, because you really can't feel any string, you just have to do it by  ear, bending the string, and, and hopefully it doesn't go boing, slip off, you know, because  it's, you're relying on the lever to grip it, you know. 
[02:29:30]  You don't even realize that, yeah, so much of it is feel, you know, the feel of the string  under your finger.  That's so odd to be able to do that and not have any sensation.  No.  What's going on under there.  No, absolutely not.  You have trouble, like, grabbing someone else's guitar and playing it?  Because of the string thickness and how it's set up?  No, I've never been, that's the thing as well, being left-handed, it's always.  Oh, well, yeah, that too.  Yeah.  Okay.  It makes it very awkward.  Lefty guitar.  And if I've been into a music shop, there might be one left-handed guitar there or something.  Isn't that the worst? 
[02:30:00]  They, they never have, they'll have like one, and it's not even a good level one.  Yeah.  Be like one of those Mexican Fenders for like 40 bucks.  We got one here in the back!  Have you ever been to Southpaw Guitars in Houston, Texas?  It's basically the guitar center for left-handed guitar players.  I don't think so.  It's insane.  They got everything.  Les Paul's SG's.  I don't want them in there.  Yeah?  What's that?  I don't want them in there.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  It was then I wanted them.  Now you get them thrown at you, you know.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  You think you have to record by them?  Why did I just say that like he has to go off? 
[02:30:30]  Hey, you should go out there.  Left-handed, I'm an idiot.  See, I beat you, Jimmy.  I asked the dumber questions.  Tell them where a guy doesn't have guitars flying at him, right?  Well, at least you didn't name 40 guitar stores like I did with the fucking years.  At least you quit at one.  I just wanted to know that I knew something.  Hey, and Sabbath, you quit Sabbath before they really became Sabbath and joined Jethro Tull  very briefly.  Yeah.  And can you talk about the Rolling Stone Circus, which you were in? 
[02:31:00]  Which was this classic thing that was Stone Shot.  I love that thing.  And Tony plays in that.  It's so weird.  It was very weird.  It's really strange.  Because when I went with Jethro Tullant, and it was a period when I said to Ian, I wasn't  going to stay.  I was going to go back with the other, with Sabbath, really.  And he said, would you just do the, we're doing this film, would you just do that with  us?  And I said, well, okay.  He said, because we won't be able to find anybody in between them. 
[02:31:30]  So I said, okay.  And what an experience that was, you know.  Just so people know, it was the Stones, Lennon was part of it, The Who, Jethro Tull, Tony,  obviously, Clapton.  And was it, it wasn't Hendrix, it was...  It was Mitch Mitchell.  Mitch, right.  Okay.  I mean, there was virtually everybody then.  And it looked like the whole audience was tripping.  They may have been one day.  And they were in like, I haven't seen in a while, but like Rain Slickers or something.  It was, it was, it's a bizarre thing. 
[02:32:00]  And then Yoko Ono, she blew the whole thing.  Oh, that was really strange.  It was almost like the first super group.  You guys are all jamming.  And then she gets up to the mic and starts doing her dumb cat noises.  You couldn't have liked that, Tony.  Button?  He's going to be a gentleman.  He's going to be a gentleman.  Tony references it in the book.  He does?  Yeah.  It's like, what is she doing?  It's not a glowing review. 
[02:32:30]  Okay, good.  Good, good.  Because, I mean, as a music fan, you're like, this is a, this is never going to  going to happen again.  And then she steps up to the mic.  Did I ever show you guys that YouTube video where it's Lennon and Chuck Berry playing on  TV?  And, and Yoko's there.  And they're doing one, I think one of Chuck's old songs.  So Chuck's killing it.  Lennon's psyched that he's there.  And then in the middle of the song, Yoko just goes, walks up to the mic.  No, she had a mic on her bongo.  She turned the mic up to her face and just goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  You see Chuck Berry makes his eyes just go wide. 
[02:33:00]  Like, because one of those deals, like, it's not my place to tell her to shut the fuck  up, but, but shut the fuck up.  Yes.  Lennon must've been scared of her because you're with all your peers and you allow that to happen.  It was awful.  Well, I mean, besides that, the rock and roll circus is an amazing thing.  He didn't seem that bothered, to be honest.  I mean, they seem so much in another world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He might've been, sometimes you get caught up in something and you think that your chick  is better than she really is or, or higher than she is or whatever, whatever the 
[02:33:30]  situation is, he might've just thought like, it was great what she was doing.  It was rough.  Yeah.  I mean, I've, I've seen, it's not good.  He didn't look at the people's faces.  Well, I saw all the musicians and it was, oh my God.  Oh, they were all laughing.  But you know, who's going to say anything?  Yeah.  That's the understatement of the, oh my God.  And Jimmy talks about it in the book, right?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  And it's, uh, he's not as kind in the book.  Good.  Good.  And, uh, he's very nice.  He's being very nice now, but you can tell by the way it's written. 
[02:34:00]  Uh, were you responsible for any of the Jethro Tull songs or it was so brief?  Uh, there was one song that I just done a riff on, which was, uh, nothing is easy.  Okay.  I never write in that.  But, um, that was it.  We'd have gone after that.  Okay.  When you, did you guys write fairies wear boots?  Was that, uh, there was a fight you had, uh, with a bunch of skinheads, a really violent  altercation.  Did you, uh, write fairies wear boots based on that?  Um, no, I don't think it was that. 
[02:34:30]  Uh, Giza wrote all the lyrics, of course, on that.  So, I mean, he had a wild, weird imagination of, uh, things depending on what he'd smoked  the day before.  Um, but, um...  Ah, the days.  He, he, he could have possibly done it from that, but I think it was more from, uh, a vision  he saw when we were in Germany once, uh, somebody leaping across the snow and he'd just, he used  to come up with these funny ideas, funny sort of titles and funny, uh, weird sense of humor. 
[02:35:00]  Is that where the, why did the skinheads attack you?  Because that was a, because you, you said at one point, I handed Ozzy a hammer and they  went outside and Ozzy was smashing people.  No, I didn't hand it to me.  He grabbed a hammer.  Yeah.  Uh, what, what happened was Giza, we did, there wasn't mobile phones in them days or  there wasn't even a phone in the building where we played.  So Giza went out to phone, uh, management at that time to find out if we were collecting  cash or what, what it was after the gig.  And as he was in the phone box outside, uh, the, loads of skinheads just surrounded the 
[02:35:30]  phone box.  And of course it, you know, they were going to get him and when he came out, they sort  of whacked him and he, and he ran and he came in to us and, uh, he said, oh, you know,  told us about all these lot outside.  So rather than stay inside and be safe, Ozzy grabs a hammer.  Well, we had to, we had to go out, we had to get out because we leave the buildings and  they're all outside waiting, you know, so there was no option really. 
[02:36:00]  So we went out and he just grabbed a hammer and, um, thank God he did really.  Cause I mean, there was, there was a lot of them.  There weren't just like half a dozen, there was like probably 40 of them.  Wow, man.  Yeah.  And, um, one man with a hammer that'll, that'll make a lot of people leave.  Well, it made a few people uncomfortable.  I know that, but, uh, sort of one, somebody grabbed me, uh, grabbed him around the neck  and he, he went buying with a claw end back on their head.  Oh, man. 
[02:36:30]  But just Ozzy hitting somebody with the claw end of a hammer, it's like, I can't picture  it.  I just can't.  I pictured it.  You think that guy brags about it now?  See the scar?  Yeah.  Let me tell you a little story.  I've wondered that, like, do those skinheads ever, like, in three years ago, oh my God,  that was fucking Black Sabbath we had a fight with.  Just got hit by a hammer by Ozzy.  You'd, you'd get hit by a hammer by Ozzy, right?  I, I, any of the guys could hit me with anything they wanted to.  Tony's wearing a cross, I hope he fucking sticks at my eye.  I'll take it.  He's not joking, Tony. 
[02:37:00]  He's not joking.  I'm always interested, too, by, uh, by, like, rock feuds or people that have these weird  things that we don't get to see.  And you said that Bonham came, uh, John Bonham came to one of your, your shows in 1980 with,  and this is with the, with the Ronnie James Dio lineup.  And him, him and Dio had, uh, some kind of words?  Um, well, yeah, it wasn't, it was, yeah, that's some kind of word.  Um, we, we, John came to the gig, uh, when we played at Hammersmith in London, and we 
[02:37:30]  were going to go out after the show to a, a, a bar.  Anyway, John's drinking, anyway, on the side of the stage, drinking Guinness, and, um, we  came off stage, and as we walked, walked past John, John said to me,  Oh, man, he's got a, he's got a great voice for a midget.  And, of course, Ronnie heard it.  And he didn't mean it sort of like that.  He meant, he, he actually meant that he, what, a little buddy, and he got a big voice. 
[02:38:00]  But the way he said it, and, of course, Ronnie popped up, and he, I won't repeat what he  said.  And they were going to fight.  I mean, he, I mean, he, I'll, I'll repeat what he said.  Ronnie walked up to him and said, you fucking cunt.  And, uh, so basically I had to, uh, get him out the, I said, look, just, just go, and  I'll, I'll see you later.  Just get out.  And you've, uh, you've rented quite a bit.  This was, uh, I, I, there's like a weird thing with you and the supernatural. 
[02:38:30]  And my, one of my favorite story in the book, there's going to be no point.  I mean, this book, it looked old, everything.  Yeah.  I'm still going to read it, though.  I want to get all the details.  Believe me, there's a lot more than I'm giving.  I can't wait to get into this now, especially because of Jimmy.  There's so many interesting things in it.  Like, and, uh, there's a great, uh, chapter where you, uh, or a piece.  And the chapters, by the way, what I love, they're very short.  Like, literally two and three page chapters.  So, like, any subject, you're just hitting boom, boom, boom.  And it moves, the book moves very, very quickly.  I love when you can knock out a chapter quickly. 
[02:39:00]  Dude, and you read six chapters.  Just knock it out.  I'll go one more chapter.  It's two pages.  You need to read fucking four chapters.  You're left in this chapter, damn it.  Then you get to the pictures, and you're like, oh, there's five pages down.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's just the way you do it when you're trying to finish a book.  It's like a job.  Hey, how come if you have all these great stories about, uh, John Bonham?  They're all hilarious, and, like, I'm a John Bonham freak.  Why, whenever they do one of those retrospectives, why don't they have, if you would think if the  guy was the best man at your wedding, that they would assume that you kind of knew him,  and that you would be able to add, uh, to the story. 
[02:39:30]  Like, I know the BBC just did one with, uh, Dave Grohl was, uh, was narrating it.  How come, did they ever ask you to do those types of things?  No, I don't think so.  No, I've done a couple of things on, on John, you know, of course, when he, uh, just, uh,  little stories.  But no, no, no, I think, uh, big TV thing, no.  Yeah, because those are, like, two of the best stories.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I've heard, and then it's, like, with, like, all the different names.  I've got to ask one drummer geek question that drummers are going to want. 
[02:40:00]  How the hell did he, was his bass drum foot that fast?  Did you ever see him?  Did he play with his toe?  Did I ever see him?  I mean, did you ever, like, stand, like, rather than, like, you know, when you're out in front  of a drummer, you can't see what their bass drum foot is doing.  Was he heel up, heel down?  I, I don't know, because I used to, I used to sort of see him from, uh,  Mystery.  I used to go to gigs with him when he was with another band before Zeppelin called The  Way of Life.  And, oh, they used to play at some right dumps.  And there's always, again, and again, there was always fights.  Every time, you know, in them days, there was always a fight there for some reason. 
[02:40:30]  This one place they played at, there was, it broke out into a horrendous fight.  But I always remember Bonham, he had his, he had all these pints of beer all around his  kit, and he'd be, you know, drinking them and playing.  But he was just really a, just a special drummer, really was.  No, just an incredible drummer.  And his sound was unreal.  That's back in spring.  He came right through the 70s, and he started muting their drums, and he was still, once  again, just focused.  Yeah.  Just doing it my way, go fuck yourself up.  Well, he used to try different things. 
[02:41:00]  I remember he tried, uh, he tried getting a drum sound in, in a big truck.  He, he set up the, his kit in a, in a, inside a big truck for the, the ambience.  Of a truck.  Yeah.  The ambience of a truck.  Yeah.  And, um.  Oh, for like, when, like, recording, he tried, try to get sound.  Yeah, he wanted to try to see what it sounded like.  Because it sounded like shit.  I don't think he used it.  I mean.  And so, you know, I'm not going to give all the stories away.  There's a couple, I will, because we're, we're almost finished on the Open Anthony show.  There's a million stories.  Here's the stories I will not tell. 
[02:41:30]  The time you almost killed Bill Ward.  Uh, the time you set Bill Ward on fire.  And, uh, the night fight that Geezer Butler almost had with Malcolm Young of ACDC in a  bar.  The bar fight, uh, where somebody got shot in the mouth.  There's a lot of things I am not going to tell the story.  Because a lot of.  You just don't know.  Oh, no.  But there's lead ups and there's happenings and there's so much stuff.  That supernatural thing got my interest.  What were you going to ask?  Well, there was a car accident.  Uh, I was going to talk about the rented house, but I won't talk about that.  That's a, there's a very fucking creepy story about renting a house, um, where you were 
[02:42:00]  hearing things.  But what happened?  There was a car accident you had, um, which I thought was pretty interesting.  Were you, uh, did you not go off, uh, embankment or something?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  I was, uh, driving, it was a convertible and I was driving along on the outside lane,  just overtaking somebody.  And it was a girl accident.  I'm looking.  And, um, suddenly there, bang, bang.  And the tires just blew.  I must've gone over something.  And it just pulled the car off and I went flying off. 
[02:42:30]  There was a huge drop at the side of the, um, of the road of this, like a freeway type  thing.  And I came off that and went through the trees and saw the panels of the, of the, uh, wings  come off the, the car.  Um, I thought that's it, you know, bang, it's a tree.  And, but, but what do you want to hear about seeing angels?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was really peculiar.  I saw three and I saw these three figures, um, and I wasn't drugged or anything like that. 
[02:43:00]  It was, uh, it was a real, um, strange feeling.  And then, then the, then the car, then the car tipped up upside down and I was knocked  out.  But, but yeah, I did say that.  And there's a lot of stories of, of supernatural things and the way they're told, I, and I,  I'm really skeptical about that stuff, but the way you describe, whether it's you or Bill  or you and geezer seeing this stuff in these different places you were recording, I find  it very believable because the way people talk to each other, it's, it's the way people see  something together. 
[02:43:30]  Um, so it actually, I find that to be a really interesting aspect of the book.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I normally wouldn't.  I mean, some people would go, oh, you know, they've had too many drugs or too many drinks  or whatever, but it wasn't the case, you know, all the things and the other guys would see  the same thing.  So it's, uh, yeah, it's quite interesting.  Well, I guess, I mean, I could, I'm talking to Tony, uh, for another half hour on my Boneyard  show, which will air tomorrow.  But, uh, what can you say about the book?  It's amazing.  And I genuinely loved it.  There's a million great stories in it. 
[02:44:00]  And it's called Iron Man, my journey through heaven and hell with Black Sabbath.  So, you know, which is, what can I say?  You just, you know, you changed my life.  This was good or bad.  Believe me, I would like trannies anyway.  That had nothing to do with that.  Really, really good, good interview.  What is going on?  This is the worst of the Opie Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Are you all right?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:44:30]  Are you all right, Anthony?  Yeah, I'm all right.  My pride is dented.  Your pride is dented?  My pride's dented and I'm a little woozy, a little dizzy.  My equilibrium's way off today.  Really?  Yeah, I think I jostled my inner ear.  Are you going to get checked out?  My tinnitus is gone, though.  You're going to get checked out.  Maybe you should get checked out.  Nah.  Your tinnitus is gone?  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  It went away.  Did that happen, honestly?  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  I woke up this morning, I'm like, oh, my tinnitus is gone, but I'm fucking woozy. 
[02:45:00]  I'm all dizzy.  Thank you, sir.  Tinnitus is when you hear something like, what's it sound like all the time?  Mine's like, do you always have that?  Yeah, it's from, you know, bands for my whole life, just loud.  You don't think about it until you're, like, laying in bed sometimes, and it's just completely  silent.  That's why I always sleep with the TV on, too.  It's like, get a little bit of noise.  Okay.  Tinnitus, it's like, sucks, but.  Well, it's good.  It's good.  That's gone.  Yeah.  Anthony had a car accident yesterday. 
[02:45:30]  I wrapped up my Mustang.  Anthony wrapped up his Mustang.  Motherfuckers.  He says he was going 30 miles an hour.  Hey, look.  Don't even judge.  I'm not judging.  Don't fucking judge.  Here's what happened.  You make it sound like you're on your way to church, though.  Here's what happened.  Okay.  Uh, my Escalade was being, uh, used by, uh, by somebody else.  No. 
[02:46:00]  Melissa was using it.  And then, uh, I had to go to the bank.  It's three in the afternoon.  Right.  I'm like, I'm going to the bank.  I'll take the Shelby.  Well, okay, that's a bad one there, Danny.  Oh, I thought that was yours.  No, no, Danny's showing some Shelby Rex.  So, uh, I'm like, I'll take, uh, I'll take the Shelby.  Uh, I know this type of weather is not conducive to the Shelby.  So, uh, I'm like, ah, fuck it. 
[02:46:30]  You know, I'll take it out.  I'll be nice.  I turned from my street onto the service road, along on an expressway service road, and,  uh, noticed, like, the tires spun real easy.  And I'm, I'm not, I'm not fucking racing around.  I'm just going to the bank.  Is that the sand and the salt on the road?  What do you think?  No.  Here's the problem.  With, uh, it's 800 horsepower.  Is that a lot?  Yeah.  What's a regular car?  50.  It all depends, but you, I don't know.  If you even have 200 horsepower. 
[02:47:00]  That's nice.  Yeah.  A BMW, what do you think it is?  Or a Benz, like 250, maybe 300?  Yeah.  They, they make some, but four.  Wow.  Twice as much as that?  Five.  He's, he's about three, three times the average car.  But it's, it's crazy.  So, uh, the, the thing is, it's got very hard tires on it.  The rubber on, on these tires are very hard, very low profile.  And they gotta be, they gotta heat up to have any traction.  The roads yesterday were fucking freezing cold. 
[02:47:30]  Uh, so I, I turn out onto the service road and I'm like, okay, I gotta watch my ass.  Cause this, this thing really doesn't, does not want to stay on the road.  So I'm going down the service road, doing 30 miles an hour.  Any snow or ice?  Uh, a little bit on the sides of the road, but I wasn't in it.  Okay.  It didn't matter at that point.  It might as well have been ice, cause the tires and road just did not want to play with each other.  Uh, so, uh, um, heading, I'm in second. 
[02:48:00]  I'm heading into a slight, just the slightest curve before I reach, uh, the road that I gotta make a left on to get to the bank.  And, uh, I hit third, I let off the clutch, the fucking ass end of this car just goes, ah, fuck you, fuck you.  Comes right out and I'm there inside trying to compensate, you know, let's turn, let's turn the other way, let's, and then, and then in that very, very short time between losing control of the car and it hitting something, 
[02:48:30]  you can have a thousand thoughts in your head.  You're just sitting there going like, all right, all right, I'm spinning.  I'd like to stop this spin.  Um, maybe I'll just do a one 80, three 60, and I'll be in the middle of the road and go, whew.  And, uh, I'm off and then I'm still trying to correct.  And then I realized, oh, all right, now I'm going in one direction a little too long. 
[02:49:00]  I can't see anything because it kicked up a shitload of snow because I'm, I'm brushed on the shoulder and snow went flying everywhere.  So I noticed I'm going in one direction really, uh, for, for a little too long.  And I'm like, all right, I'm, I'm hitting something.  And then, uh, the front, uh, driver's side, uh, hit the guardrail.  Bam.  Oh.  And I bounce off of that.  And, uh, and then I'm like, okay, I hit that.  I guess I'm, you know, I guess I'm still in one piece, but, uh, well, I'm still moving. 
[02:49:30]  So, so it spins around and now the back passenger side hits the guardrail.  Bam.  And then it just slides down the guardrail and, uh, comes to rest kind of sitting there.  Wait, it slid down the guard, it hit it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Slid down the guardrail.  That's not good for paint.  No, no.  It made, left a little, uh, left a little scratch.  Might be able to buff it out. 
[02:50:00]  Ooh, ooh, bad.  Yeah, the whole front just fucking.  It might be totaled.  That beautiful front end.  The fucking.  Oh, yeah, we've all seen pictures.  The tires look like fucking Sam's feet.  They're just not in the right direction.  Just flat.  Flat-footed and pointing the wrong way.  And then, uh, the back, uh, passenger side rim is just bent up and the tire was split and  the whole front, like, like that whole corner of the front end, um, below the bumper just 
[02:50:30]  ripped on the guardrail.  And, and, and I saw something that resembled some type of fluid cooling thing and that  was hanging on the guardrail and, and, uh, the coolant was all spilled out.  No gas.  Airbags didn't go off.  Didn't see any oil.  Um, so, uh, it's in the insurance company's hands now.  But, uh, but I was, I was feeling like a little like woozy, but you know, you just 
[02:51:00]  hit something.  Do you have a concussion?  I don't think so.  I don't have a headache at all.  There's no headache.  It's, uh, and when I move my eyes, that's fine.  But it's when I move my head around, I get like, whoa.  And if I stand up and bend over to pick something up and stand up, it's like, holy fuck.  Like really dizzy.  Why don't we get Dr. Steve on the phone?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you go to the doctor for that?  Uh, I don't know.  Because I get in fucking trouble any time I take the day, fuck off.  So I figure if I smash into something in my car, I better fucking come in.  You should go to the doctor. 
[02:51:30]  Cunt suckers.  Just leave me the fuck alone, would ya?  I'm only asking.  Cock dick fuck asses.  Oh, I would have loved to have fucking taken the day, maybe.  No, I smashed my fucking car up, and I gotta trod my ass in here, feeling like I'm fucking,  uh, uh, doing a tightrope walk, walking down the hallway.  But no, no, God forbid Anthony takes a fuck day off.  Blow me.  Yeah, I don't feel good.  I'm achy as fuck.  I'm woozy as a motherfucker.  But I'm here, you cunts. 
[02:52:00]  I'm here.  Assholes.  Fuck them.  It really did piss me off, because I really did not want to fucking come in today.  But, you know, God forbid, God forbid, I'd have notarized pictures of the car, maybe,  and send it over down the hall.  You sure?  Really?  Yeah, well, yeah.  And then I get this call.  Hi, Anthony, it's Bob. 
[02:52:30]  Uh, Anthony, yeah, uh, Steve Blatter just called.  You weren't in today.  Yeah, I crashed my car.  Oh, well, you know, that's no excuse.  You, uh, do you have all your limbs?  Yeah.  Then you should be in.  Then you should really be in.  I think.  And suck it.  As much as I.  I'm tired of that whole thing, by the way.  I'm tired of that whole thing.  Just take a day off, I'm a fucking cunt.  Yeah, that's me. 
[02:53:00]  Ugh.  I think they would have understood a car accident.  Oh, do you?  No, I don't.  I think they would have.  I don't.  I absolutely don't.  Because it sounds like it was a pretty bad car accident, to be honest with you.  It fucking hurt.  And it sounds like you got banged up pretty good inside the car.  I did.  You don't even know what you hit.  I went forward and to the left.  Yeah.  Forward and to the left.  We got a doctor on the phone.  And, uh, oh, great.  Jack.  Jack K.  Jack Kevorkian.  Let's go to, uh, Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve. 
[02:53:30]  Now, before you say anything.  Dr. Steve?  Yeah.  Oh, hi.  Before you say anything, realize this.  I am a severe hypochondriac, so have a good phone-side manner and discuss this very nicely.  Okay.  Okay.  Here's what happened.  Did you hear what happened?  No, I understand someone needs a doctor's note.  No, no, no.  No, I, I, I, I...  Really quickly, Anthony, uh, I wrecked my Mustang yesterday.  I smashed my Mustang.  Okay.  And, uh, I, I hit the front, uh, driver's side first. 
[02:54:00]  The airbags didn't go off.  I had my seatbelt on like a responsible human being.  I wasn't going that fast.  Uh, I didn't hit anything.  My head or anything.  I have no headache.  Okay.  Um, but my equilibrium is really off.  Like, I, like the fluid in my ear went fucking like, woohoo.  And, uh, and, uh, and my, my, my tinnitus from my band-aids is gone.  But I, but I hear fine.  Like, my hearing is fine.  My vision is fine. 
[02:54:30]  And if I keep my head still and move my eyes around, I don't get dizzy.  But if I bend over to pick something up, like I move my head around, then I get, like, real woozy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, here's the thing.  Inside your ear is these things called the semicircular canals.  Yes.  It's just full of our flow.  Three different directions in, in three-dimensional space.  Right.  They can sense movement in three dimensions. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  And they do that by flow.  When you turn, when you spin.  Isn't that the cochlea?  No.  No.  No.  The cochlea.  You said cochlea.  I know.  The, uh, uh, the semicircular canals are right next to the cochlea.  Oh, okay.  And, uh, when, when you spin, uh, in a chair and then stop and you get dizzy, that's because  fluid continues to flow.  Flow in the semicircular canals and then there's little hair things that can sense it in there. 
[02:55:30]  Right.  What, what probably happened in this wreck is that you knocked one of the little stones  that's on the end of one of these hairs, uh, you knocked it a little bit, a kilter, and  it is now sensing, um, improperly so that when you, uh, when you, when you move your head,  it thinks that it's moving more than it really is.  Will it go away?  Yes.  How about you start with, it will go away? 
[02:56:00]  Oh, God, Dr. Steve, you're scared.  I thought I was going to be dizzy forever.  I don't, I don't think that sounds bad.  I was thinking he's got to have an operation on all this.  I thought I was going to be dizzy forever because the little stone was skewed.  You never be able to pick up your own bag again and hit somebody because you have cochlea  fluids all over the floor.  Dr. Steve, is it good that I don't have a headache and I didn't have a headache and  I'm very cognitive and I'm, I'm like, I'm not slurring and I'm, I'm, I'm good.  Yes, absolutely.  And my eyes can follow things and I can read.  Absolute.  Yes.  All of those are good things. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, good.  Well, you're not, you're not reading the guys down the hall.  They would have let you take today off.  No, they wouldn't.  Those fuckers.  Oh yeah.  I wrecked my car.  Oh, Anthony.  Day off.  Whoa.  Jesus.  Anthony, Steve called and, uh, you took the day off today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, I took the day off so I could just, uh, uh, really admire the wreck that used to be  my $110 car, $110,000 car.  Excuse me.  I was cognitive for a second. 
[02:57:00]  He's not talking properly.  My $110,000 car.  Uh, yeah.  Uh, Anthony, you know, uh, you know, they really, you're a high profile show.  Uh, they really need you in there.  Uh.  Uh, and then, uh, uh, uh, uh, could you just call Steve?  Could you just call Steve Blatter?  Because you did take the day off.  Uh, I do understand, um, you know, your arm is severed.  But, uh, you know, you don't need two arms to do radio.  Uh, yeah.  Uh, so, so, so, so this stone is askew and it's misreading the, uh, normal signals that 
[02:57:30]  get sent when you're standing upright.  Should, should, uh, Anthony do anything right now so you can get a full, uh, a full, uh,  yeah?  What do you want him to do?  Yeah, here's the thing.  Okay.  When you have post-traumatic vertigo, which is what you have.  I knew it.  Damn.  That sounds awful.  Post-traumatic vertigo.  Son of a bitch.  You need to see an ear, nose, and throat guy just to make sure that what I said is right. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah?  What, what would be the worst case scenario?  No, shut up!  Dr. Steve, please don't tell me the worst case scenario.  Because he won't go to a doctor, so give him the worst case scenario.  Yeah, he should give it to me.  So then the guy goes to the doctor.  No, no, I'll go, I'll go.  And maybe, maybe he should leave right now.  I'll go, don't fucking say that.  But maybe you should get your shits checked out.  I'm not even making jokes.  Look, hey, Ant, anytime, and this, I mean, this won't surprise you, anytime that you have  some sort of neurologic change after a trauma, you need to get checked out. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, shit.  Neurologic.  Most of the time, it's going to be this benign, what we call benign, paroxysmal, cessational  vertigo, which is what you have.  With the words being benign.  Oh, shit.  Did you sleep well last night?  Like a baby.  All right.  I hope the part of Ant, like, it would suck if his, like, his impressions part of his brain  was all ruined, and he kept trying to do impressions, but couldn't do them.  Well, I used to be the president. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, this is Andrew Dice Clay.  Her.  Hey, over there, you got to smoke a cigarette or something.  Wait a minute.  So this bitch is laying in bed, and I said, whoa, there.  Is that good?  That would rule.  The impression center in my brain.  They all sound off.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  And my car is just wrecked.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on a line.  We got another doctor.  Oh, second opinion.  Yeah, second opinion time.  John in Connecticut, you're on with Dr. Steve. 
[02:59:30]  Leave Dr. Steve on so he can, you know.  Yeah, of course.  John, go ahead.  Well, Anthony, what it seems like you have is called acute vaginal flutter.  Acute vaginal flutter.  Fuck you.  There you go.  Let me go to Cassius in Brooklyn.  Cassius.  Yeah, Anthony, what the hell are you doing taking an 800-horsepower car that has such low-profile  tires out just to run down the street to the bank?  I was, I had to go to the bank, and I was going slow. 
[03:00:00]  Believe me, I understand the dumbness of my ways.  I should have sat in the driveway and done fucking burnouts for a half hour before I hit  the road, but...  You got another car you could have taken, right?  No, that car was being used.  That's the only reason I took that.  Why didn't you wait for the car to come back?  It wasn't coming back until after the bank was closed.  Ah.  See, it's a whole chain of events that led to me having to take the Mustang out, and... 
[03:00:30]  Which one of your minions was using the car that caused this to...  Actually, it was Melissa was using the car.  Oh, that's all right, though.  Yeah, I, you know...  Dr. Steve wishes he didn't ask that question right about now.  No, no.  Well, you know what it is?  You have your cochlear fluid, and apparently it spilled all over his shirt.  It might come when you watch World War II footage.  All right, let me go there.  I have no hopes for that one.  Let me go to Ken in Cleveland. 
[03:01:00]  Ken!  Yes!  It could be a brain tumor!  Shut up, Ken.  All right, Ken?  Hey, Ann, I just wanted to know, how'd you beat the DUI?  Shut up, asshole.  It's three in the afternoon.  It's three in the afternoon, and I had...  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly, he's right.  I had just...  Three lying.  I had just gotten done working out.  I don't drink before or after working out.  And I was still in my sweats. 
[03:01:30]  I just friggin' jumped in the car and decided I was gonna go to the bank,  which is one mile from my house.  I thought I could make a two-mile round-trip drive, and apparently I was wrong.  Let's say hi to Greg on Long Island.  Greg?  Anthony.  You know, I think they would believe you down the hole if you came in with a patch on your eye.  They linger way longer.  What's that echo?  I don't know.  You should...  Hey, hey.  What echo?  I think it was just that guy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, I hear echoes. 
[03:02:00]  Dr. Steve.  There's no echo.  Yes, there's no echo.  Shut up.  Now I don't hear when it was his fault.  Hold on.  Hey, it's Christopher Walken.  Okay, this is very...  Yes, Dr. Steve's still on the line.  Let's go to Ken in Jersey.  Ken?  Hey, Anthony, what did you register in the breathalyzer?  We just...  Why is there this underlying thought that I...  Perhaps I was intoxicated. 
[03:02:30]  I hadn't had one drink.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Jersey.  Ryan?  Somebody was saying it, but we were all thinking it.  Ryan, what's going on?  Andy, how many pops did you have before you had?  I hadn't had any alcohol.  Who the fuck goes to a bank anymore, millionaire?  People that have to take out thousands at a time, fucko.  Why the anger?  Why the anger?  Because... 
[03:03:00]  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  That's what happens when your girlfriends have learners permits, Anthony.  Hmm.  He went...  What, Chris?  Go to the doctor, then go home and hug your guns and everything else you have to overcompensate  for whatever the fuck happened to you when you were a child.  My God!  Yeah.  You overcompensate.  Showed him, right?  That a boy.  Let's do a good comeback.  Big Nick.  Considering yesterday.  Congratulations to Big Nick.  They didn't pick him up in that mob bust. 
[03:03:30]  Hey, Big Nick.  Yeah, all right, Big Nick.  What's going on?  Ginzel Loon from Long Island.  Huh?  I'm good.  Anthony, the reason you, when you bend over, is because your head has so much fucking water  in it.  Being a water head.  And the other thing is, go get a pap smear.  What did you say about water, dude?  There's so much water on his head.  We heard you!  Why did he say it?  I don't remember.  He said, it was funny, because you had so much water on your head, and then his brain 
[03:04:00]  went to explain it, water head.  Explain it.  Joe in Philly, or is this, oh, actually, I think this is Dr. Kaku.  Dr. Kaku.  Oh.  Hello.  Hello, Dr. Steve.  Anthony, the fluid in your ear flows like a river.  Shut up.  Billy Crow on Twitter.  Picture these stones on the hairs, like stones on top of a monument.  Stop.  Like little planets.  Yes.  Circling your brain. 
[03:04:30]  I want to see pictures of the car.  If you're just tuning in, Anthony, you had a bit of a wreck yesterday.  Keith took pictures.  I couldn't bring myself to snap pictures.  Really?  It got pulled up on a wrecker.  It got taken away.  And we'll see.  It's either, I have to see what the insurance company says.  If it's totaled, then I will have to look at purchasing another vehicle.  If it's not totaled, I might just have to box truck it up and ship it back out to Vegas  and have them just redo the entire fucking thing, because that's the only place I would 
[03:05:00]  send it to have everything repaired on it.  But if it's totaled, I'm thinking maybe Aston Martin.  Let's say hi to Dan, who's a physical therapist on Long Island.  Jimmy's just looking at me shaking.  What are you doing?  How about a nice, comfy, big car?  I have one.  He's got one.  I know.  How about another one?  How about another gas guzzle that doesn't go fast?  I got to escalate.  Whatever's going to happen is going to happen.  Let him enjoy his life.  What are you going to do at this point? 
[03:05:30]  I can't.  Dan, the physical...  Enjoy his life.  He sings till four in the morning.  He loves it.  He dates someone who's 23.  He drinks all the time.  He has a movie theater.  How much fun should he have?  That's all he does is have fucking fun.  He loves it.  How about one after show meeting?  I gave up on all that stuff about a year ago.  Just enjoy your fucking life.  Ant's life rules.  Exactly.  Just enjoy the fucking life.  I'm fucking...  I'm here now for the show, though.  Oh!  After show meeting?  What?  Gives a fuck the radio show's a disaster.  After show meeting.  Just keep having fun. 
[03:06:00]  Let's go to the conference room.  That's between this door and the elevator.  Dan is a physical therapist on Long Island.  Dan.  Hey, Anthony.  How you doing?  Hope you're doing better.  I like to call you Dan the man.  This is a real call.  This guy does the physical therapy for what you might have.  All right.  Yeah, Dan.  What's up, Dan?  I fix this vertigo every day.  It sounds exactly what Dr. Steve had mentioned.  If you want to come in today, I'm located in Huntington, and I'll fix you right up today,  this afternoon.  How do you fix me up? 
[03:06:30]  All right.  If you Google something called the Epley Maneuver.  Oh, shit.  That's a cock in the ass.  That sounds like it.  The what maneuver?  The lucky maneuver.  The lucky lad.  That's a cock in the ass, and that wakes you right the fuck up.  What is this thing called?  The Epley.  E-P-L-Y Maneuver.  What is that, Dr. Steve?  I think that's when a plane pulls up real fast and spins over and gets behind his enemy.  I saw that on the History Channel.  Well, that's what this is going to do.  It's going to move those crystals to where they belong.  They were dislodged probably from the accident, and now we're in a part of the ear that they 
[03:07:00]  don't belong in, and it's giving you those vertigo-type symptoms.  Hey, would this get rid of tinnitus in some way, shape, or form?  It may.  It very well may.  How?  Yeah, how?  Oh, that sounds weird.  It does.  It's very...  It's...  I don't know exactly, but it may.  Oh, boy.  Sounds like Keith the Cop.  It's like...  I'm getting thousands of dollars in consultations here.  This is great.  Yes, from one doctor who you know is good and some guy named Dan. 
[03:07:30]  I'm sure Dan's a doctor, but we have no idea who Dan is.  Maybe tens of dollars in consultations.  Exactly.  Well, does Dr. Steve know this maneuver he's talking about?  Yeah, absolutely.  That would be the treatment of choice if the diagnosis of benign positional post-traumatic  vertigo is made.  Dr. Steve...  You've got to make the diagnosis first, though.  That's why you've still got to see the ear, nose, and throat guy.  Dr. Steve, what if I just get in a car and hit something on the opposite side that I hit  in the first place? 
[03:08:00]  That'd happen in both ears.  Wouldn't it knock it back?  Yeah, right.  No, Dan's right.  It would probably happen in both ears.  Oh, that would be really woozy, right?  Yeah, let me...  All right, thank you.  Let's go to St. Louis.  Mike's got something.  All right.  I think he's a doctor, too.  Mike, go ahead.  Mike?  Mike?  Hey.  Gentlemen, I believe that this is totally being overanalyzed.  All the symptoms seem to indicate a hangover.  No!  No!  I don't have a hangover. 
[03:08:30]  People are assholes.  Let's go to Tyler in Pittsburgh.  Tyler?  Hey, Ann.  I'm sorry to hear about your car, buddy.  I just have a question.  Was the car seat still intact, too?  Was the car seat still intact?  I don't know where this is going.  Yes, it was.  Okay.  Boo.  No, the infant car seat is what it means.  Oh, right.  Okay.  He should have said that.  Let's see a date young.  He should have said that.  A date young joke.  We got Dr. Steve on the line, and we also have Dr. Steve on the line.  Dr. Steve, go ahead. 
[03:09:00]  Yes.  Love you.  Love the show.  Oh, that's Steve.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  So, Anthony, is your cochlea hard?  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  My hard cochlea.  My hard cochlea.  Jimmy.  Jimmy!  There's this thing called psychogenic vertigo.  What?  Psychogenic?  What the fuck does that mean?  What is that, Dr. Steve?  I'm reading the definition of medical text.  It says, factitious vertigo is complaints of vertigo related to psychological causes such 
[03:09:30]  as depression, anxiety, or an attempt to obtain compensation, known as malingering.  So, you know, that's always possible.  Who am I going to sue?  The guardrail?  Jesus Christ.  Are you trying to take a day off compensation?  That's what it is.  I see.  We heard, Dr. Steve said, compensation, think the day off.  Oh, God, Anthony, take your day off.  I felt a little woozy the second it happened. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Like, I felt a little woozy.  And then a little woozy during the rest of the afternoon and evening.  I went to bed pretty early last night because I was a little sleepy from working out and  having a little trauma in my life.  So, why don't you call one of us to tell us this shit went on?  Because I wasn't feeling woozy until I got up this morning and it felt like I was on  a fucking one of those spinny things in a little park.  So, these fucking guys would have said, all right, take the day off, get your ass checked 
[03:10:30]  out.  No, they wouldn't.  They'd have called Bob and I'd have been through more fucking drama.  Enough.  Try to take a day off around this fuck place.  Jesus Christ.  Enough already.  How many sick days do I have?  Can I count them?  Can I fucking get an accounting of how many sick days I have?  And if I still have some, leave me the fuck alone.  Oh, God.  Jimmy, did you talk?  I don't even know.  Sure. 
[03:11:00]  The guy in the line, no?  No.  Oh.  Forget it, dude.  Let's move on.  I wish I got amnesia and forgot what assholes I work for.  Fontaine.  La, la, la, la, la.  Yeah, I get it, Fontaine.  That's me.  Very good.  That head injury has taken Anthony's racism in completely the other direction.  Oh, how great would that be?  He's a bleeding heart.  I'm a bleeding heart liberal.  Fucking knocks the racism right out of his head.  You know, the cause of the black man, I am completely behind it. 
[03:11:30]  I am a lifetime member of the NAACP, and I give to the United Negro College Fund.  Oh, very nice.  And I think the judicial system is so jaded and biased against blacks, it's terrible.  And that's the only reason that they have a huge population in prison, by the way.  And instead of hanging with Danny and Keith, he's now hanging with me and Coop and fucking Malik from Asbury Park.  Oh, shit, you know all the players.  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  What about Afro guy?  That'd be nice.  I forgot his name already.  I like how Danny's just looking at cars I can get if my car's totaled.  I'm looking at Danny just scrolling through cars that I'll be able to buy perhaps.  Danny's very excited.  Gets to go shopping with you.  Gets to go car shopping.  Chris in Staten Island.  Chris.  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Good, bro.  Ant, just curious.  Is banking a code word for high school dismissal?  No, I like how you laughed for yourself.  No, that was Dr. Steve laughing. 
[03:12:30]  Oh.  See, you're fucked up, man.  I can't distinguish the laughs.  Nope.  No, it was a laugh of, damn it.  All right, we got another doctor.  We have a real doctor on the phone.  Steve just plays one on the radio.  He's a real doctor?  Let's go to a real doctor in Arizona.  Dr., I don't know, Solomon?  Dr. Solomon?  Dr. Solomon.  Sounds like a doctor's name.  I want a Jew doctor always.  Of course.  What's up, sir? 
[03:13:00]  Dr. Solomon Carmody, yes.  I'm an auto-aryngologist.  Anthony, the best thing to do is go home, fuck your beautiful girlfriend, and shut the  fuck out.  Sir, could you say that in not such medical jargon?  In layman's terms, please.  Please, sir.  We're not all college grads here.  College grads.  What are we, med students?  Someone is suggesting you should just put an ATM machine in your house.  I really should. 
[03:13:30]  An ass-to-mouth machine should be in my house.  That would be a wonderful thing to do.  Oh, God.  Oh, that guy.  Unbelievable.  So he should be checked out, Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get checked out.  It's most likely benign.  They probably will do that athlete maneuver, and you'll be fine.  What is the maneuver?  What does that entail?  Is it twisting my neck around or some shit?  What they do is they have you sit upright, and you turn your head to the side where you're 
[03:14:00]  having the vertigo at like a 45-degree angle, and they lie you down.  And then you sit there for five minutes, and then they turn your head to the other side  like 90 degrees.  And then you sit there for five minutes.  And then you roll your body up to your side.  And you know what?  You get the picture.  What they're trying to do is put your head in a position where those crystals can slide  back in place.  Crystals?  It's crazy inside the body. 
[03:14:30]  But if you go to an ear, nose, and throat guy, and he agrees with my diagnosis, they'll  just do it right there in the office.  Now, you may have to do this several times, and may even need to do it a few times at home  before this settles down.  Yeah.  But it will settle down?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Usually it will.  Usually.  Yeah, usually.  I don't like that.  Well.  I like 100%.  Let's do a little.  Can we do a little WebMD right now?  No, I hate WebMD.  It's always scary. 
[03:15:00]  Don't.  Don't.  Don't do the WebMD.  Look, Dr. Steve says, don't.  It's scary.  All right.  Let me say hi to Paul in Philly.  Paul.  I think he got a conclusion of the brain.  Paul A.  What the fuck's funny?  Yeah, yeah.  How's it going?  What's up, Paul?  That was Larry Fine.  Hey, I'm warning you.  Hey, Anthony.  My father's a TV repairman.  He's got a really cool set of tools.  We can fix your car.  All right, asshole.  It's an awesome set of tools.  Everyone knows it's awesome.  Come on.  We're going to do this Bicoli line. 
[03:15:30]  Do it right.  What was that?  The TV edit?  Yeah.  Very good.  Let me say hi to Chris in the Poconos.  Chris, from the heart-shaped tub, of course.  What's up, Chris?  Of course.  Yeah, and you fix your tinnitus like you used to fix an old TV.  He's just hit it good enough on the side, and you get rid of a fucking A.  I'm just smacked myself on the side of the head.  Yeah, you hit your head so hard, you fucking fix it like your old TV.  So I don't have enough static.  Yeah.  I don't like this crystals thing.  Yeah, it's either the Fortress of Solitude or fucking... 
[03:16:00]  It's scary.  I don't like crystals in my head.  Sal's got a good question.  Sal.  Hey, Lou!  Sal.  Hello!  Anthony, do you need a letter from your mother to get out of work today?  Yeah, that probably would work better than just a grown man trying to call up or...  No!  No!  Anthony needs a letter from his mother!  No!  He needs to get out of work!  He crashed his car!  Thank you.  I think what Ant needs to eat is an ear of corn. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, an ear of corn.  That would be funny, Chip.  What's that?  Hey, this is a very good question.  Yeah?  Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Wow, the phone's just lit.  Everyone has questions about Anthony's car wreck.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, did the cops show up?  Yes, the wonderful woman from the Nassau County Police Department showed up, took down the report.  All right.  Everything was cool.  We pay her off.  Oh, I didn't have to pay her off.  We pay her off. 
[03:17:00]  So you got rid of the booze before she got there.  All right.  There was no booze involved.  You have to like, relax.  It's good.  I didn't get rid of anything because there was nothing in the car.  It was three in the afternoon.  I had just worked out and I was going to the bank a mile away.  When did you finally call the cops?  10 o'clock at night?  No.  I know, like Ted Kennedy.  After he went home and took a seven-hour nap, he finally said, you know what?  I better call the cops. 
[03:17:30]  Then he goes back to the scene, all rested and nice.  No, that's not what happened.  He goes like Ted Kennedy.  She was on the spot.  How did he go home wet and take a fucking nap, Ted?  Yeah, I was tired.  Jesus.  Did he say he took a nap?  Someone.  Yeah, yeah.  How did that scumbag survive that?  Taking a dirt nap.  He went home and took off his wet clothes and took a nice fucking snooze.  I swam away.  Oh, God.  Before he called the ambulance, right?  Well, when he died, we all just praised him.  Fucking scumbag of a human being. 
[03:18:00]  Dr. Steve, what does it mean when a girl is blue and isn't breathing after hours?  That was Anthony's dice.  Oh, no, Anthony.  Oh, no.  You're one voice off.  Something's all confused in my head.  One voice off, guy.  My synapses.  Let's go to Richard in West Virginia.  Richard.  Suck my cock.  You want to suck my cock?  Richard, you there now?  Oh, not for the suck my cock.  Not for suck my cock. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  Good job, guys.  Keep Ant talking.  The more he talks, the more he gives away about his DUI.  I didn't do anything.  I wasn't drinking at all.  Well, first of all, sir, you admitted that you had Keith the cop come and photograph the scene.  Who is your buddy?  No, I called up Keith to give me a ride back home after the wrecker came and took my car away.  Secondly, sir, you said that a female cop showed up, which everybody knows you would have bent her over the hood of your Mustang.  No, she was a wonderful woman, did a great job, fast, let me sit in the cop car there to warm up. 
[03:19:00]  Was he hot?  Because it was freezing.  It was freezing cold.  And then a fan pulled up.  Some guy, I forgot about this.  Some guy just pulls up.  I thought you meant a fan.  No, no.  Because you were overheated.  No, no.  A gentleman pulled up, pulled in front of the wreck.  He gets out.  He goes, everything okay?  I was like, yeah.  And he goes, oh, I always wanted to meet you, but not like this. 
[03:19:30]  He's a fan of the show.  Just stop and shake my hand and say hi.  Thanks.  But, you know, I'm a little busy here.  It was crazy.  Maybe this nice chicken noodle soup will make me feel good.  Oh, sweetie.  Oh, mmm.  And crackers.  Oh, have a cracker.  Crack-ass cracker.  I love crackers.  Brian in Oregon.  Brian.  We're a little failure.  Hey, we need to ask Dr. Steve about alcohol content and how long it lasts in the system.  Because watching videos until, like, Sunday morning at 4 in the morning drinking umpteen 
[03:20:00]  Captain and Cokes beer, wine, and everything else, I think he's still got alcohol in the system.  Twelve hours, bottle to throttle.  Shut up.  Oh, now they're not with Captain and Coke.  Look, there was no alcohol involved in this mishap.  It was Sunday morning at 6 in the morning.  You were still drinking.  It was Monday afternoon at 3 p.m. 
[03:20:30]  Exactly.  What was I drinking?  Absinthe?  Shut up.  You sound drunk, by the way.  I am, because I haven't slept yet.  Good.  I, uh, yeah, I had to go along and pick up pieces.  There's nothing worse than having to pick up the pieces and put it in your trunk.  Oh.  Did you, uh.  Useless pieces.  Did you unscrew the shifter and put it in your pocket?  I remembered.  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  I didn't unscrew the shifter. 
[03:21:00]  I threw everything in the car and they hauled it away.  Like so much garbage.  Nah, what are you going to do?  Sounds like, oh yeah, well let's go to Jesse Ventura.  Jesse!  This sounds like a conspiracy.  Did you check for thermite paint?  They usually paint the road with ice.  It's thermite ice.  It's the opposite.  It's the worst shit ever.  Thank you, sir. 
[03:21:30]  No problem.  Didn't quite sound like Jesse, but I got the point.  There's so many fucking questions.  I thought I spelled it all out, but people, uh, they always, first of all, they think,  Well, they're just waking up.  If you're just tuning in Ant Crest's Mustang.  Yeah, I wrecked my Mustang.  Pretty impressively.  I wrecked my Mustang.  Let's say hi to Keith in Connecticut.  Keith.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Anthony, Anthony, I love you, but I'm so happy you smashed.  I hope for Christ's sake you slow down now.  I was doing 30.  30. 
[03:22:00]  Hi, don't yell at me, you calm down.  You smashed dick, not me.  Jesus.  That's a good point.  Not much sympathy from you, sir.  That's a very good point.  I could wash or wax my car.  You gotta get your shit fixed and painted.  Oh, fuck.  Well, have fun with your fucking Chevette.  Washing and waxing your Chevette, you piece of shit.  Shut up.  I still have a perfectly good Escalade.  The Cadillac of SUVs.  Shut it.  And drive it through your 22-foot garage door at your fucking house like an asshole. 
[03:22:30]  I never drove through my garage doors, sir.  That was my mother.  She did that in North Brunswick.  She crashed through the garage door when she was learning to drive.  Oh, really?  And the fucking, my dad and me were just standing out there looking at the fucking, at the garage  door, which is bent in at a 45-degree angle, and we're just giggling at her.  Like, she was so upset.  Like, my father just looked at me, and I just had to laugh.  We fucking howled.  That's better than my story, where I just backed out through my garage door. 
[03:23:00]  You didn't open the garage door.  That's great.  That's wonderful.  We're taking advice from you.  God bless you.  The guy that came to fix it said, you know, the next time you do this, I'm going to have  to replace the door, so it wasn't the first time.  Sure.  Oh, shit.  You've done it before?  Yeah.  That's good.  Rear view mirror.  How about that?  We're almost done here.  Let's stay out of Mark in Jersey.  Mark E.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hello, Eric.  Anthony, why is that car even on the road with all this snow and crappy weather and salt?  That thing should be covered, pampered. 
[03:23:30]  What are you taking that car out for at all in this weather?  Look, my friend, it's garaged.  It's in the fucking garage when I have it.  I took it out because I needed to go a mile to the bank.  It was imperative.  What about the Cadillac of SUVs?  Why didn't you just jump in that?  Melissa had that.  Melissa had the Escalade, so I had to drive the Mustang a mile.  They always say the worst things happen closest to home. 
[03:24:00]  They sure do say that, sir.  Is that true?  Yeah, within a couple miles.  Especially house fires.  See, because it's...  All right.  Let's go to Greg in Oregon.  Greg?  Greg?  Yeah, I love you guys.  Love the show.  Hello, fuck yourself.  Did you hit that guardrail hard enough that some of your hair plugs fell out?  They're not plugs.  They're follicles taken from a harvest region and individually put in place in the natural direction your hair grows.  That would be funny, though, if you hit the thing so hard that all of a sudden they were all like porcupine quilled into the ceiling of the car. 
[03:24:30]  I threw them off like porcupine quills.  Just get a dustpan and just sweep them off the highway.  Let's say hi to Joey and MD.  Joey?  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was curious to know if Ant's going to charge any hate crimes against the black ice.  Ah, see?  Damn black ice.  There was no ice.  No ice.  Cold road, cold tires, too much horsepower.  Damn slave ice.  I bombed.  Goodbye. 
[03:25:00]  So did I.  Greg on Long Island.  Greg?  Greg?  Anthony, your story's starting to fall apart.  If Keith came to pick you up, why didn't you use Keith's car?  Keith wasn't at my house.  It doesn't matter.  You could have had him pick you up and drive you to the bank.  Why do that when I had a car?  See?  I...  Well, you don't have a car now, do you?  Well, now I would have to call him Keith to take me to the bank.  You smartass.  Mr. Hindsight.  I have a Lumina for sale.  Do you want it?  Yeah, you Lumina. 
[03:25:30]  That'll keep you safe.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Okay.  I hear that echo again.  Oh, my God.  Come and go.  Yeah, right.  All right.  Wow.  Jason in Canada.  Jason.  Yeah, did Anthony sound like David after the dentist?  Is this going to be forever?  That's exactly what I did.  All right.  Another word since stepping out of that vehicle, though, and looking around.  And the engine instantly stopped. 
[03:26:00]  And it's like, oh, yeah, that's not restarting anytime soon.  And then you get out and look and oversee it.  When I first got out and looked at the driver's side, it was like, all right, don't look that bad.  And then you look dead on from the front and notice that your car is pigeon-toed.  And it's a very expensive suspension and front end and everything.  It couldn't be driven home, right?  Who knew?  You had to drag it up onto a flatbed.  Were you crying as they were like, no, I was just sitting in Pete's vehicle with the heat on. 
[03:26:30]  Just going, this blows.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  It's up to the insurance company now, my friends.  Chipping a little more and get a Ferrari.  I love that.  Get a Ferrari.  Chip.  What?  I had a Ferrari.  I was driving it so fast.  I was doing like 137.  I was spinning around and went like over an icy lake and stuff into a ravine.  But I just threw it home.  I was like, right out of there. 
[03:27:00]  I love lying, Chip.  I was just throwing it home.  I was right out of there.  I'm not lying.  I just had a better cost.  So what?  Dr. Steve, I hung up on you.  Not on purpose.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  I'm sorry.  I really didn't mean to do that.  Dr. Steve.  I guess that's it.  So you're all right?  As far as I know, Dr. Steve wants me to get checked out.  Checked out.  I would have done that this morning, first thing.  I think you're going to have to take the rest of the week off.  You better tell the guys down the hall.  It's crazy because, ooh, imagine that phone call. 
[03:27:30]  Hi, yeah, it's Anthony.  Yeah, I wrecked my car last night.  I was feeling a little woozy.  But then when I woke up this morning, I really had trouble even putting my pants on, standing on one leg to put my legs through the pants.  And I'm feeling, okay, yeah, you're right.  I'll be right in.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I fucking apologize profusely.  I'll be right in.  Perish the thought.  Did you have trouble getting your pants on?  Yeah.  I had just woke up.  Oh, there's your car in happier time. 
[03:28:00]  Oh.  It doesn't help that the picture you took is you with a big glass of wine in front of it.  That's a big glass of grape juice.  Look, I wasn't driving a thing.  That doesn't help.  I'm toasting my vehicle.  That doesn't help what people are thinking this morning.  I'm toasting the vehicle.  The only picture we can find of your Mustang is with you in front of it with a big glass of wine.  I am toasting it saying, ah, look at my vehicle.  Cool.  You'll be eulogizing it next for that same glass of wine.  Remember my vehicle. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Look at that smell.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  What are you worth going to guess?  On SiriusXM.  Who do you think has the biggest dick on staff?  The biggest penis on staff.  I would guess Anthony.  Who is the biggest dick on staff?  That's my one.  I didn't know talent was included in the contest.  It's not.  I would guess Ant.  Oh.  Well, thank you. 
[03:29:00]  Just accept your award.  I'm accepting my award.  It might be Sam, though.  Sam's real skinny with big, dumb, long fingers.  Yeah, his big, dumb, long fingers.  Sam, you got a big piece?  It's fine.  Are you over seven?  It's fine, Matt.  And when was the last time Mother saw it?  Many years ago.  How do you know?  Cleaned it in the tub.  I mean, how do I know?  I don't live with it.  I would know if...  Just washes them like big boy Bubby.  I love that stupid seat.  Troy is very confident.  Oh, yeah.  Troy might have an eight. 
[03:29:30]  And he fucks a lot of broads.  That's all right.  I think his high hair might make up for a small genital.  When did Mother see your penis for the last time?  It was when I was a small baby.  How do you know?  You had that circumcision at 24.  What about your operation?  She wasn't in there.  She didn't perform the surgery.  Well, she probably wanted to see what it looked like.  She probably changed the bandages for you.  She didn't.  Oh, that's true.  No, it's not true.  She was paying for it.  She was blowing on it like soup.  That was warm.  God damn it.  Did she change the dressing? 
[03:30:00]  No, she didn't change any dressing.  The bandage dissolved in the tub, and that was it.  Was there a drain put in it?  No, what?  So the pus would drain?  No, how long do you think the bandage was off?  How long did your dick hurt for?  Oh, my dick hurt for...  It hurt for like three or four days.  How bad was it that night?  It was very sensitive for like two weeks.  Did Mother ice it down?  No, Mother didn't do anything.  Can we do a quick call to Mother today?  You really have to fill till 10, don't you? 
[03:30:30]  Of course you can.  I looked at the one sheet.  I don't like anything else on the sheet today.  So how about 20 bucks a man?  We have to figure out the last time Mother saw Sam's penis.  All right.  I'm going to guess there was a thing in high school where she walked into the bathroom  not realizing, quote unquote, that Sam was in there because the steam billowing out  didn't hint, and he was standing there.  I'm going to go with 12 years old.  12, you think?  I'm going high.  When he was popping that quarter off of his ankle?  I was like, look at his dick. 
[03:31:00]  His shorts were, his short leg was open and his dick fell out.  I'm going to guess after the surgery.  It was a peck in 12-year-old.  Well, the surgery was out of high school.  I know that, but after the surgery, I want to say Sam was helicoptering it in his kitchen  showing off.  It could have been a by accident peak.  That's why I'm saying 12.  Well, it's not a peak.  Maybe some pajama bottoms that had the fly open a little too much.  And then it just comes flopping out.  I'm going 12, Jim. 
[03:31:30]  24.  24?  You doubled his.  You don't even want to play, do you?  Oh, yes.  I wasn't even living at home at 24.  I think I could win this by saying...  I know.  You could say like three or something.  Yeah, well, I can't go over.  The plan price is right rules.  Why would you go over 24?  That's way too old.  I know.  I was living in my own apartment.  Well...  It could go 11, though.  I could go 11.  Oh, no, no.  11 would be... 
[03:32:00]  11's over.  You came over for dinner and it just fell out at the table?  I'm going to say you were seven years old.  Seven.  Seven years old.  Mother saw your penis.  Okay, so you said seven.  Opie said 12.  And Jim said 24.  I'm going to go...  I'll probably go younger than all.  Oh, you're playing, I see.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't have a distinct memory of it, but...  Now that...  I'll say...  I'll go six and be the lowest.  Yeah, but that's just dumb. 
[03:32:30]  How is it dumb?  Because it's not playing the game.  All right, so five.  It's not the spirit of the game.  Now you're just trying to win.  Five, then.  That's fair.  All right, let's get Mother on the phone.  Where's Mother?  Where is this bitch?  Mother!  Mother!  Blood!  She'll probably be psyched.  Huh?  She'll probably be psyched to hear from you guys.  Oh, I'm sure.  She's psyched to hear herself on the radio.  Well, boy.  Apple doesn't fall far.  No shit. 
[03:33:00]  Mother?  Hello?  Hi, Mother.  Hi, Mom.  Are you ready with the music?  They haven't even done anything yet.  Mother.  No, Sam's mom is all our moms.  You know, this is really unfair because I wasn't listening to the show.  That's good.  I don't know what we're going to talk about.  Oh, no, it's very easy and it's very quick.  We don't have to waste your time today because we know you've got things to do.  Although they will waste your time because it's 35 minutes to 10.  All right, look.  We're having a slow show, so we're hoping you can pump it up a little bit there, Mother. 
[03:33:30]  Mother, we've got a question for you today about your young Sam.  Young Sam.  Okay, let's see.  What is it?  And I want you to be honest now.  Okay.  And give it some thought.  Really?  We don't want you to answer right away because you might have forgot something.  Right.  We really want you to sit back for a moment and really think about it.  Make sure your answer is correct, okay?  Oh, this sounds like a good one.  Oh, yeah.  We want to know, Mother.  And there's money on the table.  When was the last time you saw Sam's penis? 
[03:34:00]  Don't answer.  Like, really think it over.  There might have been a vacation.  A vacation?  What do you think happens on vacation?  Well, even an accidental walk into a room.  Yeah, we're not talking about the last time he changed his diaper and all that crap.  You might have accidentally saw it, but you know what I mean?  Maybe he has his shorts on.  We were saying his shorts are on.  He's sitting Indian style on the floor.  Yes?  Yes.  Call someone else.  And you see up his pant leg and be like, ah, you turn your head quick, but you saw it. 
[03:34:30]  Or maybe he was older, and you actually just walked in the room accidentally.  You didn't realize he was in there.  Exactly.  I have absolutely nothing for you guys today.  Because it's been so...  This will be such a boring call.  Why?  No, we just need an answer.  You've got to have an answer to the question.  The last time I recall, he was like, I don't know, maybe six or seven, something like that.  Like, in the bath. 
[03:35:00]  Listen, I don't go around looking for this.  Six or seven?  Thanks.  Oh, and let me ask you a question.  Thank you.  How on earth does the subject at the show come around to Sam's penis?  Oh, no.  That's how we started today.  That's what we were all thinking.  I mentioned Sam's penis, and Open Ant looked at me and went, oh, my God, I was just about  to say that.  We're kind of bummed we had to do two big interviews today, because we wanted four hours  about Sam's penis.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  I'm not...  She's not sure, though, Ant.  Come on.  She's sure.  You guys both owe Ant $20.  Six or seven?  I said, I'm fucking...  I'm rolling.  It had to be some...  I have never even...  I've never caught a glimpse of it.  He always keeps it under control.  Wow, because I keep it covered with clothing.  She's bummed that you keep it under control.  What do you mean bummed?  She said it, not me, Sam.  She didn't say I'm bummed.  Well, I can read between the lines. 
[03:36:00]  I obviously can't.  She says that you keep it under control.  That means she's looking and hoping that it slips.  That's not what that means.  She's just curious.  She made you.  She wants to see what she made.  You have a very strange idea of mother-son relationships.  Look, my son is 18 months old, and I already know he's got a big piece.  He's a nice one?  I'm not saying...  Oh, you didn't ask me that.  Oh.  Well, yeah, I'm reading between the lines, Opie.  It sounds like you'd think your son's penis is nice.  Nice one.  Does Sam have a nice piece?  I think he's probably quite well-endowed. 
[03:36:30]  Oh.  Oh, boy.  This isn't too fucking uncomfortable.  No, I'm filling up.  Oh, God.  Why would you say he's well-endowed?  Because you asked is why she would say that.  But she has an answer to it, though.  I love this.  Yeah, why would you say that?  Why would you say that?  Is he more girthy or length?  I've never heard any complaints from girlfriends or anything.  Why would they talk to you about Sam's penis?  In its turgid state? 
[03:37:00]  Just in a totally normal thing.  Like, you know, when you were giving him a bath, did you ever think, like, oh, wow,  he's going to have a good life?  Why would she think that?  Why not?  No, I did not ever think that.  Oh, wow.  And, Mother, why didn't you get him circumcised at a normal age?  Why did he have to wait until he was 24?  He wasn't 24.  Oh.  Well, it really was not a decision that I made.  It was just his dad said there's no reason that he should be circumcised. 
[03:37:30]  And he's the one who controls the penises in the family.  I guess, yes, that's right.  He controls the penises?  That's right.  Until we're 18, those penises are his.  So you imagine that Sam is well-endowed.  She's just saying that because...  This is probably the weirdest conversation I've ever had,  and I cannot even imagine how many people are listening to it.  Not many today.  A good amount.  We had TI on.  We did have TI on, though.  And at a BC.  Yeah, our show is very ethnic today. 
[03:38:00]  That's right.  Yeah, you still is.  Very ethnic show.  You'd be proud.  It still is.  Yeah, we're still on our ethnic segments.  Yes.  With young Sam.  Why don't you talk to her like a human being instead of just bringing up these horrible  questions.  That is true.  When was the last time you went to the women's club?  How was the women's club?  It's fine.  I was over there about 10 days ago.  Oh, what'd you guys discuss?  Do you hear them stretching? 
[03:38:30]  Do you hear them trying to get content?  This is what we do.  The old woman's club there.  You never know.  Also, we're going to hit on something, Sam.  I know.  Sit back and learn.  This is what it is.  This is like when the car's going...  And you're just waiting for...  We're going to get something out of this.  You watch.  What are you talking about?  What did you talk about 10 days ago?  Sam just challenged us.  Now watch what we do.  You better sit down, Sam.  This is going to get ugly. 
[03:39:00]  So what did you discuss 10 days ago?  Yeah, at the women's club that you belong to.  We had an art quilter come in to give us a demonstration.  An art quilter?  An art quilter.  Oh, why'd you say that?  So this guy is a guy?  No, it's a woman.  Oh, thank God.  Of course it's a woman.  Yeah, it's a woman.  They love women at this club.  I guess that'd be the next logical step, wouldn't it?  Yes, it would.  So this woman comes in and she teaches you how to quilt.  Is she a young lady? 
[03:39:30]  No.  Of course not.  Did she teach you how to make different things out of quilts?  Like how to make...  Oh, that's how she...  A little penis helmet.  A quilt fist.  Oh, my God.  I was thinking of a little cute quilt hat for your penis hat.  I'm very interested in this now.  She's...  Oh, sorry.  What did you learn as far as a quilts go?  We learned how she takes photographs and transfers them to disposable paper and uses that on top of quilted material. 
[03:40:00]  Oh.  And uses fabric to make the picture and then quilts it.  Wow.  Uses a quilting stitch over it.  So how long do we have to wait for your giant Sam face quilt?  Obsessed mother.  Wait.  How dare you?  Does it actually...  How dare you?  I'm actually interested in this now.  I want to get my...  I didn't even think of that.  No.  That's a good idea.  Oh, no.  Does it actually look like the picture?  Sure, because I have some photos I want to get made into quilts. 
[03:40:30]  What is it, the big shit in the bottom of the toilet quilt or the Jim's turgid penis quilt?  I don't think I should ask her about that.  No, but I want to know.  Does it actually look like the photo once the quilt is done?  That's a good question, Jimmy.  See it, Sam?  Yes.  Great question.  Oh, yeah.  You can recognize the photo.  Yeah.  Well, it sounds good, then.  I would jump all over that.  It's like one of those cakes at Carvel.  Would you ever quilt, like, just penises? 
[03:41:00]  Why would you...  Like a quilt of penises.  That is not a good question.  Like a penis quilt.  Why?  Just a whole different...  It would be a wonderful art project.  A bunch of different penises.  It would be.  And then you'd make it into one big quilt, Sam.  All the girls down there at the club could all chuckle while they're grabbing the quilt pieces and sewing together.  What was it?  The AIDS quilt?  You need a different thing.  Yeah.  It said the AIDS quilt.  Look, I got a project for you ladies at this club.  You all go home, and you quilt a penis, and then you connect it to everyone else's, and then you make the penis quilt.  It's so weird. 
[03:41:30]  I don't think I can even ask these ladies to do that.  But you...  They're all older ladies.  But did you hear what she said there, Sam?  What?  She's open to the idea, but she's with the wrong group of ladies.  I'm very disturbed that this concept of penis quilt even comes up in your head.  Look, man, you said we had a stretch, so watch what we do.  So we're going to do penis quilts.  We're doing penis quilts.  Well, anyway, all right, she talked about the quilting and stuff, and that was all you did?  You just got together there?  You had your little...  And then we had, like, tea and sandwiches after. 
[03:42:00]  Tea and sandwiches.  Like ladies do.  Wow, very ladylike.  And what were you girls cackling about during the coffee?  He said with disdain.  They have to cackle about things.  Do you talk about Sam all the time to the girls, and do they just hate it?  I do not.  Write enough about your dumb son.  Remember, I was discussing him yesterday with a guy at the post office.  Oh.  That's your in.  Hopefully about future employment.  That's your in, though.  I like it. 
[03:42:30]  Start by talking about your son.  Wait, wait.  This guy just looked at me, and he said, you're Sam Roberts' mom?  Whoa.  Whoa.  That is pretty cool, though.  I listen to you guys all the time.  He pulled out a weapon and killed all of his co-workers.  Yeah, he nailed a bunch of letters or something.  And they wanted me to bring them an autographed picture of Sam.  Wow.  Do you hear how she said that?  Of Sam.  Not you guys.  Of Sam.  Yes. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, you probably wouldn't accept an autograph from you guys.  We need shitshow promo pictures.  Yeah, I know.  I'll do that.  I'll take your picture assignment that you guys won't take.  You guys use the Iron Sheik picture, and I'll use the studio space.  We are using the Iron Sheik picture.  You watch.  You watch how they start using that one.  All right.  Well, I think we've got to get Sam's mom in a different club.  What kind of club?  She's a little...  She's too young for this old lady quilting crap.  Yeah, she's too young.  She's still wild.  She's got a wild streak in her.  Young and hip.  You think so?  And she's sitting around drinking teen-eating shitty sandwiches with ladies waiting to die. 
[03:43:30]  That's not your mom, Sam.  That's not your mom.  You're right.  She needs a hobby.  What do you like to do, Sam's mom?  Well, you mean other than talk about Sam?  Yes.  Do you like to rock climb or any of that crap?  Yes, she's a rock climber.  No, I don't like to rock climb.  I don't like heights.  But you don't want to be with these women eating dumb sandwiches and drinking tea, right? 
[03:44:00]  Oh, shit, I'm sick.  That's the first thing I like to do.  I have a small group that I see, and we're sort of into memoir writing.  Swinging?  What?  Scats.  Scats.  Into what type of writing?  Memoir.  Memoir.  So you write your memoirs?  Memoir.  Memoir.  What's memoir?  That's how you pronounce it.  Oh, I always go memoirs.  Memoir.  I'm into memoirs.  Memoir.  So you write those.  How dull are those?  I mean, yours is probably very exciting. 
[03:44:30]  You gave birth to the unbelievable talent that is Sam Roberts.  No, one of the ladies that is working on stuff actually is with a hippie in the 60s.  Got him fucked up again.  Yeah, and Haight-Ashbury during the whole Danis Joplin.  Oh, the Summer of Love.  Yeah, and she's got, you know, she's written about, like, walking down the street on her  way to a Danis Joplin concert while she...  And tripping over her own pubic hair, by the way, because they used to keep it long back 
[03:45:00]  then.  That long?  Mrs. Roberts.  Yeah, they were very hairy back then.  They kept it very long back then.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, you must have groomed yourself.  Oh, did we find an opening?  Hey, Sam.  We sure did.  You just want to see what's over it.  You should have just kept your mouth shut.  Oh, no.  This was supposed to be a one-minute phone call, Sam.  Oh, Sam had to challenge us.  That's right.  Oh, hey, that reminds me.  How come nobody's jumping all over this Andy Sandberg thing of taking Sam's, you know, 
[03:45:30]  like, one-question interview with a guest we couldn't get?  Who?  Andy Sandberg.  Oh, yeah.  I heard SNL stole the bit.  He did a similar bit on SNL.  It wasn't nearly as funny.  I think there's some people at SNL.  At this point, I'm convinced we got some people at SNL that listen to the show.  She's right about this one.  It's similar, right, Sam?  Yeah, except less funny.  Yeah, I don't think he's that funny, to be honest with you.  He was on the show once and only once. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, he sucked on our show.  Did he?  Yeah, he really did.  He was a bore.  But Sam's pretty funny.  Thank you very much.  Oh, we know.  We know.  The constant, the constant fucking.  It's the only reason she deals with our nonsense.  So she can get more Sam is funny shit out there.  I want, what is the next?  I enjoy talking to you guys.  Why would you think?  Where were you at with this?  I was going with the pubic hair and if she, you know, shaved it down back in the 70s.  What type of a question is that to ask a lady? 
[03:46:30]  But they didn't.  Do you keep it wild now?  I didn't hear what was going on in the show this morning.  I wasn't going to tell you because it's because, you know, I was in the shower.  Oh, my God.  She must be drunk.  I had a conversation with you guys.  It became like, you know, a Twitter sensation or something.  Yeah.  Because you really did tell an extremely hot story, Mrs. Roberts.  That's right.  With the steam and the shower and the soaping up.  Yeah, that whole thing that Anthony did. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  I get this.  Don't watch me like that.  Andy Samberg thing.  Well, it's a good question, though.  Ant was kind of curious about the maintenance.  Yeah, the maintenance back in the day.  Can we guess what age you gave up on the maintenance?  Don't say yes.  Don't say no.  Don't say a number.  What are you, the attorney?  What happened?  Exactly.  Just because you already know, maybe we'd like to.  Oh, gee.  Wait, what happened, Sam?  I'm just saying.  I have farted.  I would assume Jim.  One man. 
[03:47:30]  I really didn't.  That might be my food pocket acting.  Oh.  Ew.  Are you a breath on the mic?  Jesus.  Heart breath.  All right.  Where are we at?  We're talking about Mrs. Roberts' grooming habits back in the day.  When did you start cleaning up the area a little bit?  Because everybody does it, right?  Sure.  Don't give a number.  What?  I can't remember.  Good one.  Perfect.  But you did start, like, cleaning up a bit.  Don't say yes or no.  Because it was getting crazy.  But no one cared back in the day. 
[03:48:00]  I'm just looking at the clock.  Is it really only 940?  Yep.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  They're in this together, these Roberts.  I thought it was at least, like, 10-2.  I was really hoping 52 at this point.  What's the shortest you'd say that you trimmed it?  Oh, that's a good question.  Yeah, but you don't have to answer.  Well, you don't have to, but you should.  But you shouldn't.  Well, either that or Sam gets fired.  It's up to you.  Yes, because there wouldn't be a wrongful termination lawsuit involved in that.  No, no.  But at least you'd have to answer. 
[03:48:30]  You'd have to present photographic evidence.  Yeah.  They'd ask her in court.  Yes.  What is in your pants?  So would you say, Anthony's question was, when did you start to kind of maintain the area?  Clean it up.  She don't remember.  I can't remember.  We're keeping it high, Brown, Mrs. Roberts.  Oh, you're like Ronald Reagan.  I know what she's saying.  The Iran-Contra hearings.  I know what she's saying.  Yeah?  It's just, it's been bare for a long time.  Really?  You're thinking Woodfloor? 
[03:49:00]  Yep.  Are you sporting the JonBenet Ramsey?  We need you to take your phone.  No, don't do that.  Oh, jeez.  We don't need this game anymore.  Well, wait, well, how about we ask her, Sam?  She's an adult.  That's right.  Mrs. Roberts.  Yeah?  Listen to Jimmy.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  We're thinking about bringing back an old bit.  It's in your pants.  And we're thinking you might be the perfect person to bring back this fine bit.  I know that old bit.  Yeah.  She's aware of your games.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:49:30]  I heard that old bit before.  Did it make you chuckle?  Not going to happen, guys.  Just rub it on the dog.  Not going to happen.  Just rub it on the dog.  Just avoid this whole thing.  Oh, Sam.  Rub it on the dog.  These two, there's something like Oedipal going on here with these two.  It's not Oedipal.  It's just that we're both in enemy territory.  No, you just very, very, you take care of each other in a way that is a little uncomfortable. 
[03:50:00]  Oedipus Complex, that's where you steal records from fucking the station.  With a wig.  With a horrible wig on.  With Terry Clifford's wig.  That's way too inside.  You're right.  Go ahead.  What?  Why are you playing this?  Wow.  I haven't heard this a lot.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Good song.  Place the receiver.  Right.  Upon your beaver. 
[03:50:30]  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  All right.  Mrs. Roberts.  We got Mrs. Roberts on the phone.  You know how the game is played.  Don't let them bully you into anything.  What we do is.  We're assuming your pants are down at this point.  Yes.  Of course they are.  Yes.  What we do now, you take the phone, right?  You rub the receiver.  Prop one put up on the sofa first.  Yeah, yeah.  You rub the receiver of the phone on your most intimate of areas, and we will judge, just 
[03:51:00]  by the sound alone, what type of hairstyle you're sporting in that area.  The choices are, of course, a full triangle.  Yep.  The landing strip, the Hitler mustache, and the wood floor, or the, as I like to call  it, the toddler in tiara.  Although, taking into account that, not typically our age demo, the Ted Kaczynski is also an  option.  Oh, wow.  Yes, that is true.  And don't cheat and rub the phone on Sam's father's mustache. 
[03:51:30]  Yes, we'll hear it.  We'll know.  Yes.  Don't do it, because we'll know.  We'll know.  It would be a funny bit if you said, okay, here I go, and then click.  Oh, no, that would be fun.  That would be fun for you.  That would be funny.  But this is, you know, we still have about 16 minutes of a show left here, Mr. Roberts.  Talk about raw last night.  Well, no, I don't think so.  I'd rather rub something raw right now.  Whoa.  Hey, see what we don't know? 
[03:52:00]  Well, I don't know either.  Sam's mom, we're ready.  All right, Mr. Roberts, if you would please rub the phone.  Don't do it.  So I could, we could listen.  So let's listen.  Oh?  Yeah.  Oh, am I still on?  Yes.  I don't know why, but you are.  Yes.  Oh.  Give it a quick rub with the phone.  Don't do it.  Do not.  You know what?  Didn't I tell you guys I already knew this bit, and it wasn't going to happen?  Yay.  Oh, okay.  That's Wood Floor.  Yep.  Did you not believe me when I said that? 
[03:52:30]  She's a woman of principle.  That's Wood Floor.  Yeah, give it a shot.  No, don't give it a shot.  Just for the goof.  We're all adults here.  Do you have the flying V?  It's not a goof.  It's not funny.  It's scarring.  Well, we could do like the, we could do the queef bit then, I guess.  She doesn't do bits.  What?  She doesn't do bits.  She's not one of your floozies you have call up this show.  She could do schtick.  Yeah, that's right.  She doesn't do bits.  She could do some schtick.  She doesn't do schtick either.  I don't think she's a floozy at all.  I think she's an intelligent woman.  She's trying to do a sketch. 
[03:53:00]  Yes.  Yeah, she's not one of these, you know, loosey-goosey.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  You're signing the right time.  Wow.  Throw out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Mrs. Roberts, we got you on the phone. 
[03:53:30]  It's time for the queef.  The guy who sings that song doesn't even work here anymore.  What?  And the guy interrupting isn't going to be for long.  And Troy could quickly 925 for the middle of the song.  Yes, Mrs. Roberts, it is now time.  Do you know what a queef is?  Sure.  Mrs. Roberts.  Hey, let me change the subject here.  For a second.  That's a fair question I'd ask.  Do you know what a queef is?  Do you know what a queef is?  Not a clue, you guys.  Not a clue.  Oh, well.  Well.  Sometimes error.  Yeah.  I will tell you one time that I had this really embarrassing thing I had to do. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This could go anywhere.  Was it at a black fraternity?  I cannot remember this because you're youngsters.  Yeah.  But back in the 70s, Sam Spad and I lived in Australia.  Oh, boy.  I lived at that time in this small, sort of farm town called Abilene.  Just let me say three words. 
[03:54:30]  Aborigine gangbang.  Oh, no, no.  No shit.  I'm thinking a little summer of love.  Summer of love.  And you better keep in mind, I'm still listening.  Wife swap.  Fat Eskimo fingers.  A little south of the equator.  South of the equator.  At a nudist colony.  Yeah, nudist colony.  All right, so 70.  With freckled penises because of where they were living.  On Denver, popularity and everything.  What?  What happened?  I missed something.  On one of his album covers, he wore a T-shirt that on the front said, be kind to animals. 
[03:55:00]  And on the back, it said, kiss a beaver.  Whoa.  Okay, now we're talking.  All right.  I thought that would really be a fun thing to get for Sam's dad for, like, Christmas or something.  It would bring back memories, right?  Does he do that a lot?  What's that question?  So I started looking for one, and of course, they didn't exist.  So I found this company some way that made T-shirts.  Oh, my God. 
[03:55:30]  Your mother's selling T-shirts, too, now?  Jesus.  Everyone's into the act.  Listen.  Oh, yes.  Sorry.  Of college kids who were doing these one-off T-shirts.  So I brought them a copy of the album and told them that I wanted this T-shirt.  And they looked at it, and there were like four or five of them, and they gathered around,  and they went, oh, okay, yeah, of course, yeah, we can do that.  Yeah, okay, but, yeah, if you want it.  And they're just looking at each other. 
[03:56:00]  Being more funny.  They said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not kind of a shirt, right?  They said, boring.  No, you don't get it.  So I had to explain to them.  This is going great.  It's an American slang.  Oh!  Yeah, they didn't get that it was American, right?  Yes, yes.  So anyway, I had to explain to them what a beaver was.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Oh, excuse our ignorance.  Good evening.  But I did get the T-shirt. 
[03:56:30]  To me, that was embarrassing to have to do.  I know.  It sounds embarrassing.  Okay.  And it would be better.  Hey, I'm better.  That's what I can do for you guys.  That was good.  I like that one.  So you're in Australia.  The 70s.  Yeah.  She told the story.  What is it?  That is an embarrassing thing.  But you guys didn't let her talk because of your smart aleck sound machines.  Oh, we heard it.  Well.  Yeah.  A little bit. 
[03:57:00]  Where's the wiffle ball bat?  Oh, do we have the wiffle ball bat?  Where's the wiffle ball bat?  It's 950.  You're doing well.  It's not here.  Well, damn.  Okay.  He's doing very well.  That was a quick 10 minutes.  Yeah.  It's like pulling fucking teeth.  We burnt 10 minutes right there.  Are you afraid of bottle rockets?  You know what?  That's where it's not in Tom's Sam.  We're thinking about bringing back our bottle rocket bit.  You can't even do it anymore.  Yeah, we can.  Hmm.  It's not on the show.  You're doing real life.  Oh, you just do it for fun.  Just on the street.  Aim it the other way.  Yeah.  Oh, geez. 
[03:57:30]  That would hurt.  So, uh, Ms. Robert.  Thank you.  Ms. Robert.  Well, I'm very disappointed in your appearance today.  You're really not giving us much.  I know you want to blame us, but you're really not helping us along today.  That is true.  We've given you a lot of opportunities to participate in our fine radio show today, and you really  have just fallen flat with every topic we brought up today, Mrs. Robert.  It usually takes the tiniest thing, and you guys can run with it.  I don't know what your problem is.  I, we went with, whoa, we went with, we went with penis quilts. 
[03:58:00]  We went with the, uh, the, uh, what?  The, uh, what's in, what's in your pants?  We did the, we tried with the queef.  Yeah.  Hey, what can I say?  You didn't do anything with any of it.  By the way, we didn't, we didn't, uh, we didn't, uh, explain what a queef is.  Yeah.  You want to know what a queef is?  Not really, but you can go with it.  Well, you, you, you gotta learn things.  This is disgusting.  A queef.  Okay.  I'm learning.  Okay.  You know what, uh, you know what, like, uh, passing wind is, right? 
[03:58:30]  Keep it nice in it.  From the heinie.  Keep it a good idea, yeah.  From the heinie.  You know the heinie fart?  Yeah.  Heinie fart?  Okay.  I think I've learned as much as I need to know.  No, no.  Well, sometimes Eric gets, uh, trapped other places, Mrs. Roberts.  It's true.  It's when, oh my God, she's laughing.  It's when a vagina burps like booger in Revenge of the Nerds.  Okay, well, I needed to learn that.  Wait, you really didn't know about that? 
[03:59:00]  Well, now that, now that you bring it up, I, I have heard you guys talk about it before.  She's a Christian woman.  You guys are Christians.  I thought you'd bring it up to me.  Thanks a lot.  Have you ever experienced one?  Has it ever happened?  No reason to answer.  Maybe, maybe when, uh, the woman came over to teach the, uh, club yoga or something.  Oh.  Bunch of, bunch of old ladies.  Old ladies, just backward-facing dog, weeping.  Bending in certain ways. 
[03:59:30]  It's just sucking up air like a supercharger.  I don't think so, guys.  I don't know.  Hey, do some of the ladies at the club, uh, have awful farts?  They must.  Not that I'm aware of.  You've never smelled a fart from one of those old broads?  You know what the fucking bathroom must be in that place after the coffee?  After they all have that coffee?  You know how many times I've had to say, oh, I think Helen shit herself again.  Helen's getting dementia and she shits herself once in a while? 
[04:00:00]  And they have to change her on the quilt?  Duties fall out of her pantsuit onto the floor?  Yeah, nice coffee dump.  Yeah, Helen always wears pantsuits and will always shit down the back of her ankle.  Helen's a fucking burden.  But they can't throw her out.  I'm kind of mad that Sam's mom is in this place, Sam.  You don't care enough about your mom.  It's not an old folks' home.  She doesn't live there.  She said it was.  She said that a lot of the members of this club are a bit on the older side and your mom is young.  It's a club you just go to.  You don't get sent there.  She doesn't want to go there, but there's nothing else going on. 
[04:00:30]  You've got to help her find a hobby and a better place to be.  Like what?  Well, I don't know.  Ask your mom.  Mom, what do you want?  You want me to help you find a hobby?  No, because now, thanks to you guys in this show, I have to find a new post office because  now the guy down there knows me and he will have heard this conversation today and I don't  even want to face him again.  See what you do to people?  Are you afraid that he'll see the packages you're receiving?  They're all shaped like the same thing.  Which is what? 
[04:01:00]  Like a giant thing of cookie dough.  Maybe your mom wants to go skydiving, Sam.  Do you want to go skydiving?  You just said you're afraid of heights.  Skydiving is very popular these days.  She just said she's afraid of heights.  There's a viral video out there that I think we could show her.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  Sam's mom, what do you want to do?  I kind of want to hang up on this call.  I know.  I understand that.  But in the end, we turn around and make it nice and positive.  We've got to get you out of the old lady's club.  Since when?  We've always left on an up note with your mom. 
[04:01:30]  You have not.  Last time you played the sound effect of Mel Gibson saying the C word and ended the show.  That is true, yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I think we were supposed to play this one.  Shuggie-duckie-crack-crack.  And someone made a mistake.  It happened, Sam.  You.  Not someone.  No, somebody.  You.  Somebody.  Sam's mom, what are we going to do?  Oh, are you still looking for something to do?  Well, for you.  They want to find you a new hobby so you don't have to hang out. 
[04:02:00]  I need you guys, you know.  You don't want to be quilting.  I've been to your house.  We've had fun.  I see it in your eyes.  You don't want to be quilting with old ladies.  No.  You don't care about that guy and his artistic quilting crap.  You're a go-getter youngster.  That's right.  You're young.  Artistic quilting class.  You didn't go, you didn't come home and talk to your old man about it?  Let me ask you, when Helen stands up, does everybody smell her seat as a joke? 
[04:02:30]  Helen.  No.  No, no.  Well, no, absolutely not.  And they have to talk in ways like, Helen lost her bowels again.  She lost her bowels.  Helen's so fucking, got so much dementia, she doesn't realize, but she actually zips  her pubes up.  And they're always sticking out of the front of her pants.  The pantsuit.  She zips her pubes up.  I would feel that.  How much dementia could work.  She just thinks it's a corsage. 
[04:03:00]  Helen just doesn't know.  Poor Helen.  Terrible.  Her zipper looks like a Venus flytrap.  And when are we getting more, uh, more like treats?  We've been very good lately.  No, you haven't.  What would motivate her to do that?  Exactly.  We've been very, very respectable here, Sam.  No, you haven't.  We absolutely have.  You've done nothing.  We haven't said the C word once today.  What?  If you guys, if you guys want some treats, I need a lot more praise than you're coming 
[04:03:30]  up with.  Well, we had Paul, we don't even know Paul, and his mom out of nowhere freaking does  the key lime pies for us.  Yeah, with store-bought crust.  Why don't you just get Hostess?  I don't care.  I don't, I didn't taste your mom's.  It's because you say nasty things to my mom.  That means Paul's mom wins in the baking competition that we did.  No, she doesn't, because you don't call her up and say nasty things.  Mrs. Roberts, you don't want to lose the baking competition now, do you?  Actually, no, I don't.  No, she doesn't. 
[04:04:00]  She's very proud of that title.  So should Sam stop by today for some nice treats for tomorrow's show?  I think so.  Not today, because I'm a little busy.  Oh, wait, she's busy, though.  Remember when she used to just, like, drop of a hat, take care of us?  She would put that apron on.  I can't even believe you're delaying me with this phone call.  By the way, my sister, my sister just texted me and saying she's trying to fill out her  new passport application and was trying to call my mom to get some information. 
[04:04:30]  She's leaving the country because of this show?  Unfortunately, my mother is too busy to help her because of this nonsense.  Just tell her to put black.  It happens.  Yeah.  It's okay.  Right.  I'll answer it.  They won't rush.  Where's your sister going?  I don't know.  People should have a passport, though.  Nah.  For what?  To travel.  To flee.  When you flee the country.  Why travel?  Because then, you know, you'll realize there's better places to live.  Well, then maybe you'll live there.  I love just staying here and saying we're the greatest country on earth. 
[04:05:00]  You know, man, greatest country in the world.  Ever been anywhere else?  No.  I just know.  Hey, Sam's mom, what are you doing today that we're keeping you from?  Yeah.  What are your plans for the day, Ms. Roberts?  You know, I just have a lot of things I need to accomplish.  Like what?  Give us a couple.  No, because tomorrow I'm going to be busy all day.  Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?  I'm going to go with Jess and her mom to do some wedding stuff. 
[04:05:30]  Aw.  Is that okay with you guys if she does that tomorrow?  Yeah, but she says she's doing something today.  Well, she's got to clear her schedule of today's duties and tomorrow's duties because she'll  be busy all day tomorrow at the wedding.  What kind of wedding stuff?  Did you say duties?  Duties.  Duties?  D-O-O-D-I-E-S.  No, there's a U and a T in there.  Duties.  What kind of wedding stuff do you have to do with Jess and her mom tomorrow?  You know, just, you know, talking to some florists, you know, going to the bakery, 
[04:06:00]  checking out the food, making sure, you know, that's set up right.  You know, just, you know, detailed stuff.  That's terrible.  If you could do one thing today, what would it be?  Yeah.  Hang up.  Yeah, did you hear the other BC interview?  They can hang up the phone, but I thought, no, no, that'll be rude if I say that.  See, she's so nice.  Your mom is terrific.  Even through all this torture, she's still so nice.  I love Sam's mom. 
[04:06:30]  Thank you for that.  I guess.  I mean, I don't believe it, but.  You know, I'm not used to being, you know, given such a bad time about stuff.  No, no, it's not a bad time.  You know what it is?  You've got to look at it this way.  We're inviting you into our little circle here, and you're like one of the guys now.  You're part of the.  If we didn't talk to you like this, you should feel like, you know, pissed.  And I'm jealous, because I haven't talked to my own mom in probably five months. 
[04:07:00]  Oh, okay.  Not even a phone call.  You fit right in with us, and we're comfortable with you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It's a compliment when we say, do you queef.  You fill that motherly void.  This is what you would do with your mother?  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Did you ever accidentally queef while you were playing Twister?  Either that or look at the waltz.  The 70s in Australia.  Yeah.  It's embarrassing.  Someone's face is right there.  You've got to flip the spinner the other way in Australia.  Sims, mom. 
[04:07:30]  I hear.  Way to end it on a positive note.  Yeah.  Here's your hat.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  What?  After she dragged you to 10 o'clock, this is the treatment.  Dragged?  Yes.  Like carrying the wounded.  Yes, exactly.  You should feel privileged.  We made it to 10.02.  Wait, why should she feel privileged?  We're out of here.  We're listening to the worst of the European Anthony Show.  Right here on SiriusXM.  Hey, Lou.  Hi, Louie.  We're just in the middle of Iraq wearing that hat, and it only means that he did something 
[04:08:00]  fucked up to his hair.  He's hiding something underneath that hat.  He still thinks he's at that age and stuff where he can, like...  Where there's any qualitative difference between how he looks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like highlight his hair or something.  It's like, nah, nah.  Iraq, move closer to the guys here.  Move your whole...  What did you do to your hair?  We don't know, but it's obvious.  Yeah, we don't know what he did.  He didn't even bring it up.  Sam is the instigator that came in and went, ah, guys, just want to let you know. 
[04:08:30]  He has to take his hat off.  Sam's like the little busy body.  Right.  He's got to be the little rat.  All right, let's see what we got.  I don't know what else Sam could be doing besides this.  Nah, I know.  I know.  He could be like a prison informant kind of a guy that winds up getting fucking killed.  That's it.  He'd have made a good one of those trustees in the fucking ghetto over there.  You know what, actually, my sister works for a software company, and she says it's  the whole place.  No one's working.  Everyone's just trying to fuck each other.  Just weasel.  I mean, you know, like trying to get each other fired.  Yeah, yeah.  Get each other fired. 
[04:09:00]  It's all anybody's ever...  There's barely any software going on at all.  I don't know.  Did you see the Apple documentary?  They did a documentary about Apple, but it was all ex-Apple employees, and they're like,  there's one guy, he's like, everybody thinks Apple's all cute with their quirky little  commercials.  He's like, it is the most cutthroat fucking evil.  Oh, shit.  Of course it is.  It has to be to be that success.  I'm going to call my Tom down and let the headliners talk.  Sam.  Oh, yeah.  Also, with his voice.  Eric Welts is coming in.  He also...  Whoa, got me there. 
[04:09:30]  All right.  He did.  He did get you.  Don't quit fucking teaming up with Joe, okay?  All right, let's go.  Let's get this all over.  All right, yeah.  This isn't a fucking bit here.  Explain.  I haven't done anything to my hair in many, many years.  Oh, God.  This is going to be really uncomfortable for everybody.  Did you say Orr's body?  I thought that, you know, since it went over so well after my last vacation, using Sun-in.  You used Sun-in and highlights.  Yeah, you had highlights in your hair.  So I figured I'd go all in and do a complete change. 
[04:10:00]  Oh, my God.  We're going to be so uncomfortable in there.  What is he doing?  Oh, no.  Do you want to take a guess?  Oh, no.  I'll let the Palshug people see this, too.  I pray it's at least blonde.  I think he may have shaved it.  What do you think?  No, it's winter.  It looks shaved because I don't see a lot of lumps.  Yeah, a lot of lumps.  I think he fucking dyed it.  I think he fucking went to see Billy Burr or something, dyed his hair red.  Watch.  It's going to be right here.  Let's get this over. 
[04:10:30]  I think it's something with a razor.  Can we bet on this?  No.  Cut or color?  Let's fucking see.  Is it cut and color?  Stretch this shit out.  It might be on the sides more shaved.  What is he?  1980s?  Like kid in play?  It's got a lightning bolt, you know?  All right.  E-Rock, let's unveil this.  Okay.  Let's see.  Oh, no.  It's Richie Rich.  Oh, my God.  He looks like in Fargo, the guy that fucking... 
[04:11:00]  He's the guy in Fargo that shot Buscemi in the back.  We go to Pancake's house.  Jesus.  We go to Pancake's, you know.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, like Pancake's.  What was that product called?  Come in, you fucking queer.  Dude, that is...  What are you doing, man?  That's fucking blondie, blond hair.  That's gay porn.  That's gay porn hair, right?  That's gay porn hair, right?  That's the dude from Fight Club.  Oh, man.  Yeah, the dude from Fight Club.  That's the dude from Fight Club, man.  I'd like Vanilla Ice if he was stung by a hornet's nest. 
[04:11:30]  Hey, hey, not Slim Shady.  What the fuck did you do?  What the fuck is wrong with him?  Dennis the cunt.  Oh, that's awful.  He looks like Shane Reynolds when he plays... 
[04:12:00]  Yeah.  Playoffs.  Roland, grab a mic.  What do you think?  That's bad.  Oh, man.  Roland's loving this.  I'm sad.  You shouldn't have done that, man.  What are you doing?  I think it looks good.  When I had it done, it was pure white.  And then it's over the...  Well, it's not much better.  It's not much better.  Someone goes, wow, Billy Idol got fat.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to take a picture of this. 
[04:12:30]  This is what it used to look like five days ago.  This is what it looked like.  What do you mean five days ago?  Where have we been?  All right, it's whiter, but it looks the same.  It's horrible.  Man, what did you do?  That is really, really blonde.  How old are you?  What is part of a person's life does he do shit like that?  You live alone, right?  No, I'm married.  You're married?  Yeah.  Why don't you do your eyebrows so it matches a little? 
[04:13:00]  Okay, I kind of get it.  What did you do?  Are you married?  Why not?  Yeah, just, ah, fuck it.  But he's a bright fuck you on your forehead in the morning.  It hasn't been 20 years.  He, like, just got married.  That doesn't take a while.  That is really bright.  It's gelled already.  It's a bright blonde, man.  How old are you?  Seriously.  33.  He's just like, oh, God.  I'm not going to lie.  I kind of like it.  Can we ask why?  I had talked for a while, Sam knows this on his show, that I wanted to recolor my hair 
[04:13:30]  again.  I haven't done it in so many years, but this is going to be like a one and done.  No.  Yeah, I'm not going to continue coloring it.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Well, once is enough.  You know what?  I think I figured it out.  Because you look at that, and it takes away from you looking at the rest of him.  You think that's it?  Yeah.  It's diverting attention.  Does the wife like it?  I don't remember what he looked like before, really.  His hair was really dark.  His hair was just nothing, right? 
[04:14:00]  No, no.  That's his insides.  What did your wife say?  She, it took her a little while, but she likes it.  Does that mean she hates it?  Oh, she likes it.  But she has no choice.  She's married to you.  I went to her hairstylist and had it done.  Yeah.  I got to admit, you're right now.  You went to his hairstylist?  Hers, yes.  Oh, man.  That's much worse.  This is like something you do in the sink because you're in a weird mood.  If she actually went.  Yeah.  You got foil in your hair and read a fucking Glamour magazine?  Jesus.  That's a lot.  With a cotton between his toes? 
[04:14:30]  That's because he wanted to be on the air.  Jesus Christ.  And it gets on the air a lot.  That's the strange part, man.  Hey, Dan, do you see this?  Oh.  Yeah.  I got to admit, as I stare, it does kind of look better.  I kind of, yeah.  The more I look at it, the more I'm like, yeah.  It just looks like one of those.  It doesn't look better if you ask me.  If he was wanted and they did one of those, you know, variety headshots or different ways  he might look.  Yeah. 
[04:15:00]  And you.  You're too fucking fun!  That's a fight club.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Looks like the fight club kid.  All right.  Well, you're right.  It's Pony Boy, Walt.  That's hilarious.  Oh, no.  Did your friend die in a fire?  Stay fat, Pony Boy.  Stay fat.  Stay golden arches.  I think Eric's sad. 
[04:15:30]  Eric's a stable boy.  Why is he sad?  We can see him in his eyes.  He's not smiling alone.  Joe, he's standing at a fucking microphone saying, please, please shit all over me.  I mean, what the fuck?  It's like feeling bad for your toilet.  I'm sorry.  Did I shit in you?  I should have shit in the sink.  Giving you a break for the day.  Oh, my God. 
[04:16:00]  Are you sad, Eric?  No.  It goes with his new name, Sexy.  Sexy.  He's taking this really seriously, this sexy thing.  When you wear your hat like that, you look like Robin Williams and Popeye with the fucking...  I have a little...  Win it, win it, win it, boo.  That's it for the worst of Opeen Anthony.
