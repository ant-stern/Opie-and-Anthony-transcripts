<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a caller's anecdote about the Iron Sheik being ejected from an Atlantic City casino for intoxication and disruptive behavior. This led to a discussion of other celebrity drunk stories, including a rumored bar fight involving Chuck Norris, and a bizarre speculation about the hosts' alleged encounter with Captain Kangaroo at a bar the previous night.  The focus then shifted to Tippi Tom, a previously featured homeless man, who was brought into the studio.

Tippi Tom dominated a substantial portion of the show, recounting explicit sexual encounters involving both men and women, using highly offensive language that prompted repeated interruptions and censorship from the hosts.  His story included graphic descriptions of sexual acts and bodily fluids, despite the hosts' persistent attempts to steer the conversation away from such explicit content.  The Iron Sheik later called in, offering his own rambling and often nonsensical account of the casino incident, frequently veering into discussions of his wrestling career and fame.  The segment also included a discussion on the Olsen twins' legal age in different states and culminated with the discovery of a bathroom mishap involving Tippi Tom and plans to involve porn star Lady Di in a future segment.

The show continued with further segments featuring Tippi Tom, who revealed he had liver cancer.  A bizarre interaction between Tippi Tom and Lady Di followed, with Lady Di struggling to devise ideas for a future segment and being mocked by the hosts. This conversation was also highly sexually suggestive and crude.  Tippi Tom took several breaks for beverages and delivered off-key renditions of rock songs, further prompting ridicule from the hosts. The show experienced technical difficulties with the studio audio.  John Valby, a musician and comedian, then joined the show, performing songs with graphic and offensive lyrics, sparking further discussion about their broadcast appropriateness. Three women from Pornodan.com also arrived, engaging in a sexually charged conversation with the hosts and providing visual descriptions of their actions in the studio that involved a power drill. Tippi Tom ultimately left the studio due to his discomfort. The segment concluded with discussions about the offensive content, technical issues, and the "Best Wow Contest."

The broadcast then shifted to discussions about photos of a woman in Boston, along with racially insensitive comments from the hosts about her appearance and ethnicity.  The hosts promoted their "WOW" contest, offering large incentives to attract female participants, expressing a belief that New York women were less receptive to this kind of promotion. Three-time World Wrestling Federation champion Aaron Sheik was a guest in the studio, delivering a rambling greeting. The hosts introduced their new co-worker, radio consultant John Minnelli.  Callers contributed to the show; one mentioned the on-hold messages being funnier than the live broadcast, citing repeated segments with Tippi Tom, while another recounted a bizarre news story about a woman in Alabama injuring her boyfriend with a utility knife.

A considerable portion of the show was dedicated to a heated debate on Ozzy Osbourne's fame and the perceived overexposure of *The Osbournes*.  Jim Norton argued that Ozzy's current popularity stemmed from the show, not his music, sparking disagreement among the others. This led to a wider discussion comparing Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, Aerosmith, and other bands, focusing on their musical merits, radio play, and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction. Ozzy Osbourne himself called in, briefly agreeing with the notion of his overexposure.  The discussion included numerous tangents about various musicians, reality TV shows, and the hosts' personal opinions.  The segment concluded with further discussion about Ozzy Osbourne, Led Zeppelin, and other musical acts, using highly offensive language throughout.


Finally, the show concluded with a segment featuring Jim Norton's strongly worded critique of Carlos Santana, whom he repeatedly called "overrated," "awful," and a "dopey fat man," accusing him of plagiarizing riffs from Black Sabbath's *Paranoid* album, specifically mentioning "Rat Salad" and "Jack the Stripper." Norton also criticized Santana's use of a wah-wah pedal, contrasting him with Randy Rhoads. The conversation included unfavorable comparisons between Santana and Yngwie Malmsteen, with Norton suggesting that musicians with "L" and "M" in their last name shouldn't be considered rock musicians.  The hosts debated the merits of Santana's music and the validity of Norton's plagiarism claims, with Norton offering to prove his point on the show. The segment concluded with speculation on a hypothetical meeting between Norton and Ozzy Osbourne, with Norton describing how he would initially temper his outspokenness out of respect before eventually unleashing his criticism.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey!  Here we go.  Not this again.  Oh!  Oh!  I can't take any more pain now.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Look what he's doing now. 
[00:00:30]  Ah!  Can I hear the yesterday one again?  Because today is yesterday or whatever.  Today was yesterday.  Because yesterday was so close.  Like almost like it was the same day.  Nice logic.  It makes sense.  On some strange level.  This is the Iron Sieg, the World Wrestling Federation Champion.  Pleasure for me.  To the Anthony and Opium. 
[00:01:00]  They bring me to the WNEW.  It's one of the number one station in the Manhattan and New York.  And pleasure to have come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans.  And hello to all people to the wrestling, to the WNEW station.  Number one radio station in New York.  And pleasure to have you here.  Yeah, hey.  Hey, hey, mate.  All right.  And pleasure to be here.  Well, we played that because there's a guy on the line claiming that the Iron Sheik got thrown out of a casino last night. 
[00:01:30]  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Bill.  Mike's not my real name.  I'm just doing it to protect myself.  Ah, your real name is Pete.  Yes.  Last night, he was formally ejected from a casino in Atlantic City.  He was playing Caribbean stud poker.  And after a few hours, he got a little intoxicated.  Actually, he was three sheets to the wind.  And he was warned twice on being loud and belligerent.  You know, he's just using all kinds of foul language and screaming how he's famous and this, that, and the other thing. 
[00:02:00]  Don't you know who I am?  Gag, gag, gag, gag.  Absolutely.  He then offered us his apology by trying to sign us autographs.  Now, are you sure this was the Iron Sheik?  Because I know there's another Iron Sheik going around that says he's the Iron Sheik, but he does stand-up comedy badly.  Oh, I'm a huge WWF fan for a long time now, and it was definitely him.  Yeah?  Oh, horrible.  Anyway, about an hour later, he continued to be belligerent and lost a lot of his money.  So he went to shove a guy off from a seat next to him and started screaming. 
[00:02:30]  And he reached for one of the dealers and tried to swing it at him.  So he went bye-bye.  Well, can we get the Iron Sheik on the air today, Rick?  You got a contact for him?  I might.  Yeah, we'll try to get the Iron Sheik on the show to see his story and this whole thing.  Right.  The Iron Sheik.  All right, Mike, thank you.  Have a good one, guys.  Thank you.  I have a drunk celebrity story from goddamn mega years ago, man.  My father married a woman who worked at a bar, a nightclub type thing out in California. 
[00:03:00]  And what the hell is his name?  He did Lone Wolf McQuaid and the karate guy.  Oh, Chuck Norris.  Chuck Norris.  Chuck Norris wasn't really a big movie star yet, but he was a kung fu star.  You know, he's like karate star.  Right.  And what not?  What, that he's eating?  He's eating.  He's on a mic.  He's just in the background.  All right, go on.  Just go like this every so often.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  So, Chuck Norris was, he was like a champion as far as his martial arts go. 
[00:03:30]  And he had been in a couple of movies.  Well, he was tanked drunk in my stepmother's club.  And he was being belligerent with people.  He got all drunk.  And some guy, he was hitting on some guy's girlfriend.  And this guy was like, back off, man.  And the guy got right, Chuck Norris got right in his face.  He goes, I'm Chuck Norris, Mother F.  I'm champion of this, that, the other thing. 
[00:04:00]  Chuck Norris proceeded to get his ass kicked.  No way.  His drunken kung fu ass kicked all over this bar.  And then he went on to become famous in all the movies.  But that story always stuck in my head of how just some guy in a bar beat the living crap out of him.  Classic.  He was drunk.  Well, Ann, I might be able to top you today.  Why?  I went to a sushi restaurant downtown last night.  You did?  And we're in this bar waiting for our reservation to come up. 
[00:04:30]  And Sandy, my girlfriend there, she's convinced that Captain Kangaroo is at the bar.  Is Captain Kangaroo dead?  Yes, he is.  He's dead, right?  Was the guy at the bar sitting on a satin pillow?  Was he?  Casey, I mean?  Someone find out if Captain Kangaroo is dead.  I got one of my...  She swore that it was Captain Kangaroo without a mustache.  Captain Kangaroo without a mustache.  It was getting a little too loud and this guy who looks, I guess, a little bit like Captain Kangaroo was very pissed off that Sandy was claiming that he was Captain Kangaroo and then started giving me dirty looks and I thought we were going to have to fight. 
[00:05:00]  So now I need to know if this guy was Captain Kangaroo or not.  What is going on?  Loud noise.  I know.  There's so much crap going on today.  It's not even funny.  We'll get to what's going on outside the studio in a second.  Kangaroo.  Someone just let me know if Captain Kangaroo is alive or dead, okay?  I'm looking at that find a grave thing, but I don't know if you could put Captain Kangaroo in there. 
[00:05:30]  No, what was his real name?  I don't think you need his name.  Find a grave?  Wow, what is...  Oh, find a grave.  You put in a celebrity's first name and last name and it tells you where they're buried, their tombstone, a picture of their tombstone.  Wow.  It's great.  The internet.  It's wonderful.  Maybe old internet movie database.  That probably...  You've got to know his real name.  What?  No.  You could just punch in Captain Kangaroo.  Kangaroo.  I hope that's how you spell Kangaroo. 
[00:06:00]  Anyone on the instant feedback coming up with the answer to that little question?  Captain Kangaroo.  Oh, 1955.  His name?  Robert Keishan.  As I click on his name, Robert Keishan, it doesn't have a death name thing for him.  June 27, 1927.  He is, as far as this says, still alive.  Big Kev would definitely know.  Big Kev.  I do believe he's alive.  Yes, I do see that.  And he's old, but I do believe he is alive. 
[00:06:30]  So you may have seen Captain Kangaroo yesterday?  Yeah, you may have seen him.  Was he pretty old, though?  Yeah.  So I almost was in a fight with the real Captain Kangaroo last night.  Well, how did you almost get in a fight with somebody born in 1927?  Because the guy was really pissed off and he didn't want to be bothered.  Third, I wasn't sure if he was pissed off because we noticed it was Captain Kangaroo or if we  were claiming that he was Captain Kangaroo, did you?  The guy was giving us nasty looks.  Captain Kangaroo doesn't want to be bothered. 
[00:07:00]  Can you imagine if you get your ass kicked by Captain Kangaroo?  Did he still have that horrible haircut?  Did he have the Captain Kangaroo haircut?  No, not really.  That big bowl on his head thing?  The Dutch boy, whatever it was.  He didn't have the mustache, so we couldn't really tell for sure.  I believe Mr. Green Jeans is dead.  Ah, yes, he is.  Mr. Green Jeans.  Yeah, he's dead.  That would be Hugh Branham.  Hugh Branham.  He died in 1987.  Yes, that's right.  All right, thank you, big guy.  I'm a wealth of information with this fangled Internet. 
[00:07:30]  All right, there's a lot going on.  Thank you, Keith the Cop.  Keith the Cop brought us a homeless person today, Anthony.  Well, this is one of our friends from the homeless shopping spree.  And he's already horrifying the new interns.  He looks a little beat up.  Yeah, what happened to him?  He does look a little beat up.  Did you tune him up?  He says he fell down the steps.  Ah.  He fell down, he said.  That's what the cops tell him to say. 
[00:08:00]  Tell him you fell down the steps.  Wait, Steve, why are you making that look?  You know, Mike, Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Great clips of Smokey bothering Jim Norton up on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah, not anymore.  Is that Tippi Tom?  That's Tippi Tom out there, isn't it?  Yeah.  He's a babbling, drunken bum.  Oh, yeah, yeah, you just heard that.  All right, get him in here.  Tippi Tom was one of the homeless people we had for the homeless shopping spree.  There he is. 
[00:08:30]  Steve, why don't you stand right about there?  There you go.  And Rick, of course, is right there running by.  I saw him last week at about 10, 15 in the morning, and he was completely hammered.  Don't sit here on the fire, I don't know.  Oh, my goodness.  All right, what I'm trying to say is this.  Here's what I'm trying to say.  No, here's what I'm trying to say.  Yeah.  What am I trying to say?  You've got a summer tan, bro, and a nice new sporty hairdo.  Yeah, I'm trying to say that.  It's very Keeper Sutherland. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, isn't it?  You look like Keeper Sutherland all beat up.  I'm saying I'm trying to be a shot around.  I don't know.  He's putting the beer in his pocket.  Now, what I'm trying to say is this.  It's open.  Yes.  You want to hear a joke?  Oh, a joke, a little comedy.  Yeah, it's a guy joke.  Uh-oh, are there dirty words in it?  You can't say dirty words.  All right, Wonder Woman.  Wonder Woman was on the beach where the legs opened. 
[00:09:30]  I know this joke.  What are you opening up for Vos?  Four Fantastics.  Superman saw Wonder Woman, and he flew down and did a little thing.  He got in, and then Hulk Cozen, he went down there.  Who?  Who?  The Hulk.  Oh, the Hulk.  The Hulk. 
[00:10:00]  He did a little bit with Wonder Woman, and then the rock man, he come down, he did his thing.  Anyway, they all go back.  Wait, what's the thing they're doing?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me get through this joke.  And they all get back to the fort.  And the invisible man shows up.  And says, my ass is sore as hell. 
[00:10:30]  Somehow it's so much funnier when you tell it.  Doesn't he look like he should be on a raft, being rescued after about eight years at sea?  Wilson!  Wilson!  You look like you've been shipwrecked.  Don't either.  It looks like he's been shipwrecked.  So now he's posing for the camera.  Didn't he used to be a gigolo?  I'm trying to remember tippy-tommy.  Were you a hustler out on the street?  Were you a hustler? 
[00:11:00]  Out on the street?  I'm a hustler.  You're damn right, I'm a hustler.  I hustle the best.  I've been on the street.  I know how to shake my head.  You're damn right.  I'm a hustler from whittown to downtown.  You're damn right.  I hustle.  Now, Matt, tippy-tommy.  Big bucks.  Tippy-tommy.  Tippy-tommy got big bucks.  Tippy-tommy, where did it all go wrong for you? 
[00:11:30]  Somewhere on your road in your life, something went wrong that made you end up where you are today, out on the street.  What was it?  Well, I was going back in San Francisco.  Yeah.  I went to a bar.  Right.  When I ran away from home.  Why'd you run away from home?  Oh, felt like it.  And I went there, I hitchhiked, and I was in a bar.  Right.  And I was sitting at the bar.  Defining moment coming up.  On Market Street in San Francisco. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  And somebody came up.  Oh, I can't say this.  Oh, go ahead.  Want to say it?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Say it.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Don, you can't say that.  That's true.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's true.  You can't say that.  Okay.  You can't say that.  Someone came up to you.  They gave you a...  So...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We're out of dump here.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Shut up, tippy-tom, for a minute.  Stop.  Stop. 
[00:12:30]  Stop.  Stop.  He's killing us.  Tippy-tom, you can't...  Oh, my God.  You can't say that.  So...  So, Ed and I...  All right.  I can't say that.  All right.  No, no, no.  You can't use that.  So, just say hummers.  What kind of clean stuff?  The guy gave you a hummer, so you decided to give him a hummer, right?  Hummers.  Just say hummer.  A hummer.  A guy gave you a hummer.  Say a hummer.  A hummer.  A guy gave you a hummer, and then you decided to start giving hummers? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, hummers.  Yeah.  All right.  And that's what happened?  Yeah.  Why is that?  If some guy...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Some guy walked up to you in a bar and said, I want to, you know, give you a hummer.  And you said, okay?  A hummer?  What's a hummer?  Well, everyone knows what it is, so don't worry about it.  And you said, okay?  Right.  And you said, okay?  Yeah.  Hey, let me tell you a little joke I made up.  All right, boss.  There's this lady. 
[00:13:30]  This guy joke.  She's in the airport.  She's got arrested.  They lifted up her dress, and they found two tons of crack.  You don't get it, Dave.  The Oprah Winfrey joke.  Yeah.  You got it.  We got it, Tiffy Tiffy.  I have no act.  So what happened?  So this guy gives you a hummer, you give the hummer back, and that's where it went all wrong? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  You decided you liked it?  It was like hummer, hummer.  What's it called again?  Hummer.  Hummer?  Hummer.  Hummer.  So it was like hummer, hummer.  Hummer after hummer after hummer.  So you just kept giving them?  No, I didn't start giving them.  I just gave a hummer this the other day.  And then I got a hummer myself.  Wait, who did you give a hummer to the other day?  Well, I got a buddy that I hang out with. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  What's his name?  He liked to get the hummer.  Right.  You know?  So I do the hummer.  And then he'd do the hummer.  And then that's what it was.  But there's other things that happened.  You're a good friend.  Like what?  What other things?  I can't say it on the radio.  What?  Well, just say it.  No, I think you can say it.  Yeah, you can probably say it.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, I think he can say it.  I think he can say it.  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:15:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't say anything.  Keith, shut him up.  Shut him up.  You can't say it.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  You can't say that.  All right.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Shut up.  Shut up.  What?  How did I know that's what he was going to say?  Wait a minute, Tom.  Wait a minute, Tom.  Hold on.  You've got to wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Get him out of here.  Hold on. 
[00:15:30]  Hold on, Tom.  Wait, Tom.  Where's he?  No, you don't get him.  Wait a minute, Tom.  All right.  Tibby Tom has left the studio.  I don't know.  You wanted to say it?  I don't know what made the radio, but it looks like he...  He took it in the balloon knot.  He likes to...  That's what happened.  He goes, you know, I'll say it.  I like to get...  He said it.  You know how bad that must be to do to a homeless man?  Oh, my God.  You know back there is just all brambles and... 
[00:16:00]  By the way, Anthony, that's not Tibby Tom.  Who is it?  That's our new consultant, John Minotti.  No.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  He has been brought in to clean up this place.  Look, I just have to make sure.  You're not the friend he was talking about us.  No, Terry.  He's very funny.  That's friends, boy.  Let me tell you.  Keith, you're going to just let him wander the hallways?  No, no.  He's in the bathroom. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Good, good, good, good.  You just know he doesn't have many bathing facilities.  So when he does this, like you just said, some balloon knot action that he got from his friend...  Oh, he said it much better than that, though.  Oh, he went right for the F word and everything.  There's like 15 people on hold right now that really enjoyed that last exchange.  Oh, my God, yeah.  And you know, to get to the balloon knot when you peel something, it's got to sound like a fruit roll-up coming off... 
[00:17:00]  The smell has to be horrendous.  The smell has to be...  Because it's just bad coming off of him anyway, but imagine that area.  Yeah.  Ah!  Like, you ever pass by a dead animal and that pungent smell of rotting flesh?  You guys, I got an idea.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What if Lady Di gave tippy-tong...  Oh, my God. 
[00:17:30]  Can you get Lady Di in there?  Oh, my God.  This is good.  I won't even put it to a vote.  If Lady Di does this, she stays with the radio.  She stays on the show.  Oh, boy.  And so does he for tolerating that.  Get tippy-tong back in there.  I got to make sure he goes that way as well.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That was the best show yesterday.  Absolute best.  Staple Gun Roulette just rocked.  You guys are the king.  There you go.  We're going to up the ante.  We're doing nail guns next time.  Oh, no, I got a better contest for you. 
[00:18:00]  Why don't you fill...  You get, like, nine super soakers, and you fill one of them with urine.  And one unlucky guy.  I like that one.  Where's tippy-tong?  He's in the bathroom.  Still?  All right.  Uh-oh.  Well, we're trying to get Lady Di.  Lady Di has until tomorrow to figure out what she's going to do for the show.  What the hell is she going to do for the show?  This is so sick. 
[00:18:30]  He sure told us a lot.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  What's happening, guys?  Can you tell me?  You guys know what today is, don't you?  Happy birthday to you.  Thursday, the 13th of June.  Olsen twins, 16 years old today.  Oh, yeah.  Happy birthday to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.  We have a homework assignment for someone on the Instant Feedback. 
[00:19:00]  You've got to tell us how many states the Olsen twins are legal in.  How many states are the Olsen twins legal in?  Thank you, Dan.  Why wait to 18, Anthony?  Now, wait.  What are we looking at here?  There can only be a certain number of years difference between them and the person they're  with, though.  Is that true?  Yes.  Yeah, no, no, not necessarily.  No, that's not true.  No, stop it.  16?  You can't be 16 and 33.  What is MF?  No, not female.  Male, female, male, male, female, female.  You mean there are different ages for a different type of sex? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  All right.  He's always younger for the guy, right?  So is it true that the Olsen twins are now legal in Alabama?  Correct.  Alabama.  They are now legal in Alaska, Anthony.  Wow.  They are now legal in Arkansas, figures.  In Colorado, the guy can be 15, but the girl has to be 17?  Huh.  No good for Colorado.  Good news, Anthony.  Olsen twins now legal in Connecticut.  Connecticut.  That's close. 
[00:20:00]  Wow, that is close.  They are now legal.  Ready for this?  D.C.  Come on.  I got a cigarette around here.  Tippi Tom back in town with us.  Who does?  I don't know.  Give him one, man.  Give me a cigarette.  Give me a cigarette.  Give him a cigarette.  Tippi Tom, I'm on a cigarette.  Give him a cigarette.  Give him a cigarette.  You got a cigarette?  You can take it.  How are you?  I don't have one.  Tippi Tom, you can take it right out of his back pocket.  No, you can.  Oh, look at Ben's cursing, man.  What's up with this?  You got to see it right? 
[00:20:30]  Earl, what's Earl?  Keith, you're laughing at him.  All right.  What I'm saying is this.  Tom, what happened to your eye?  I fell down the stairs.  What stairs?  At 8th Avenue, Port Authority, down there when it was raining a couple days ago.  And you fell down the stairs.  I fell down the one side on 14th Street.  And then I slipped on the water.  And I went all the way down.  And banged my head. 
[00:21:00]  Imagine seeing that happen.  Would you just be laughing your ass off if you saw him going ass over tea kettles?  What happened was this.  Yeah.  I woke up.  I'm bleeding like crazy.  Right.  I think it's time to go to the hospital.  And I got a new block.  Yeah.  Because I wasn't going to, I don't like doctors, period.  So I just, like, stayed there and by the church next to the hospital, St. Vincent, downtown. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  I'm bleeding more.  And somebody called, somebody called the ambulance and said that I have to go to the hospital.  And I said, yeah, you think so?  So the blood has come gushing out of me.  And I said, I think maybe you're right.  And so they called the ambulance. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  They put me in there.  I'm bleeding all over the bed.  Everything is coming out like a, no, I couldn't believe it.  I'm a blood out of it.  Right.  And, yeah, yeah, that's right here, infusion.  Donate some blood, you know.  Oh, yeah.  And, um.  Imagine slipping in that puddle of whatever.  And what happened was is that they wanted to stitch me up, but I didn't feel like getting  the stitch was too painful.  They wouldn't give me no St. Vincent wouldn't give me no St. Vincent. 
[00:22:30]  You take your buddy's junk in your balloon knot?  No, I'm not St. Vincent right now.  No, you take, you take your buddy's, you take your buddy's junk inside your balloon  knot, and yet, uh, that hurts?  The doctor's stitching you?  What?  Your, your buddy, you said he, he put his junk in your balloon knot.  Oh, that was last week.  I'm talking about.  But, but the, but the eye hurts?  Yeah, I hit my head.  Yeah, but what about your ass?  I was scared.  My nose?  Well, I, uh, I don't know how to do that. 
[00:23:00]  But, but I, I'll figure it out.  Hey, I want to know where he has all this action, if he's a homeless guy.  Hey, where do you go to have sex?  And the cops, we're not around.  Where are the cops when I'm banged up?  Tippy Tom, where do you go with your friend to have this?  Tippy Tom, I want to know why the, oh, the cops don't have no problem picking on the homeless  writing out tickets, but where you at when we fall down and bust our ass?  All right, calm down, George Carlin. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Tippy Tom.  Let's go.  Okay.  Yeah.  I got it down the hall.  Tippy Tom, I got to ask you a question.  Yeah.  Where do you go to have these sexual encounters with your friend if you're homeless?  I want to talk about getting laid.  Um, well, uh, it depends.  I mean, it hasn't happened for a long time.  You said just last week.  Well, he's a little scared.  He's a cop right next door.  Let's see. 
[00:24:00]  Where do you, where do you go?  Last week, it was, I forget who I was with.  Okay, too.  Because I'm a slut.  I wasn't a slut.  But where do you go?  You got to have some privacy somewhere, right?  Well, yeah, we, I know where to go with privacy.  Well, I used to hang downtown.  Uptown, no privacy.  Too many people.  So downtown, what, you go into an alley and bend over a garbage pail?  Yeah, I'm behind a dumpster or something like that. 
[00:24:30]  Imagine walking down that alley, turning your head past the dumpster, and just seeing Tippy Tom get nailed in his balloon knot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I get, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Well, yeah, when you get banged.  When I get banged, I like the jerks.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, wait, shh.  All right, we understand, but he can't say that. 
[00:25:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Well, he likes to, uh, yeah.  Let me down, no.  All right, hold on, hold on.  He likes to get banged, but then he likes to take care of himself while he's getting banged.  I like the jerks.  Yeah.  Right, just say that.  That's okay.  Don't use the jerks.  Don't say that.  Yeah, right.  But, so, you like to take care of yourself while the guy is taking care of himself with you.  Yeah, exactly.  If it go that way, it may go the other way.  Always.  So I might have to do him like that.  The reach around.  Then you've got to get the reach around. 
[00:25:30]  And then do him like that.  Wow.  This guy is, you're a good actor.  Get on.  Wow, what a trooper.  That's the way it goes.  Do you like girls, too, Tippy Tom?  I had a girlfriend.  Yeah.  And I can't say this one, yeah.  And I have a father, Ontario, Canada.  What?  Yeah.  Let's hear about this girlfriend.  Let's hear about the girl in your life.  Because we want a girl.  I only had one girlfriend my whole life.  Really?  Did you have sex with her? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  You didn't enjoy it?  What do you think she liked me to, can I say it on the air?  Well, I don't know.  Wait, wait.  Do you think?  Well, let's think about this.  Do you think he can say it?  Yeah, I think typically.  Don't say it.  No, no.  All right.  He couldn't say that.  Hold on, Tom.  Don't say it.  Don't say it again.  I think we just found our new midday show here in New York. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Wow.  He likes to go dining.  Right.  He likes to eat at the Y.  He likes to dine, yeah.  All right, Tom.  Don't say that, though.  But we understand.  Just say you like to eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y.  You know, you eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y.  Okay.  All right, so she wanted you to do that.  Eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y.  You know. 
[00:27:00]  Well, that's what I did.  All right, and did she enjoy it?  I gave her to eat at the Y.  Did she like it?  That's what I did.  And?  Tippi Tom know how to do that.  Did she enjoy it, Tippi Tom?  I don't know if she liked it or not.  Yeah?  But it turned out you liked...  She was pooping my face.  That means she liked it, Tom.  Right.  Is that okay?  That's okay.  That's good.  But then, Tom, Tom...  What about my face?  Tom, at one point, then, you decided you liked men more than women? 
[00:27:30]  Well, I liked them both.  Now, the thing is, I had more boyfriends than girlfriends.  Right.  But my boyfriend, Gary, well, you know, he...  We broke up, and the one girlfriend I had, Felomena, she didn't like me because I was going  out with Gary, and so I was like, you know, what am I going to do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm busy.  Why'd you break up with Gary?  Was it over the hockey game with Oak?  Uh, no, I didn't break up with Gary. 
[00:28:00]  Gary was mad because I wanted to stay with Felomena, too.  Right.  Yeah.  I wanted him both.  I wanted a bimbo on my right, a bimbo on my left.  I wanted two bimbos, and they didn't like...  Tom, Tom, did you ever...  You know when we were talking about eating...  Tom, Tom, wait a minute.  When we talk about eating at the Y with a girl, did you ever do that to a guy where you,  you know, go around a back?  Oh, wait a minute, Tom. 
[00:28:30]  You can't say that.  No!  Hold on.  Okay, hold on.  Keith, shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Be quiet.  Why do you have a delay?  I'm trying to say it in a way, and he just comes out and says it.  I'm just screaming to cover up anything else he's saying.  He's just yelling he's a slut.  I know, but he was saying something else, too.  So, uh, Tippi Tom has, uh, has, uh, tossed salad.  Yes, he...  Tossed salad.  Yeah, I don't think we heard that.  It's okay. 
[00:29:00]  All right, Tom, why don't you take a break?  Pop down, pop down someone on the phone lines.  I want to see if they're hearing this.  Uh, yeah, let's go to John.  John.  Hey, John.  Hey, what's going on?  Have you heard, uh, what's, we're dumping out of here on the show with Tom?  Yeah.  Hey, I got a question.  I'm waiting on, is this guy white or black?  White.  A white guy.  He's a white dude?  Yeah, he looks like, what would you say he looks like?  He looks like Kiefer Sutherland if Kiefer Sutherland was beat up. 
[00:29:30]  Now, when he gets shot in that film when he's in court, that's what he looks like.  I think he looks like, he does, he's got, like, light hair.  So he looks like a guy that's been on a life raft for three or four months, out in the sun,  all beat up with a big beard and everything, just trying to, uh, be rescued.  What's happening?  There was, seems to have been a little mishap in the bathroom.  What happened?  What happened?  Opie's going to look. 
[00:30:00]  Opie is going to look.  A mishap in the bathroom?  Oh, and Jim Norton's going, I can't, I can't look.  Right, Ben?  Nope.  Because stuff like this totally disgusts me.  Did he, oh my God.  Open that door, hold the door open.  Let me hear the reaction.  He's talking about the intern.  We got a new girl intern.  Uh-oh, what's the matter, Jim? 
[00:30:30]  Awful.  What was it?  It's just, it's just, it's just, uh, it looks like butterscotch pudding all over.  Oh, God damn.  And the seat, and the back of the seat, and.  It's actually a nice color for a throw rug.  All over the back of the seat and everything?  He he he he he.  Oh.  Yeah, smeared.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, man, juice will lighten up that color.  That might be what it was.  Where are we going with this?  All mixed in there.  Are we going to try to get Lady Di to do something to Tippy Tom? 
[00:31:00]  Yes.  Yes.  What, what do you want her to do?  Toss salad?  Dude, what about it?  Come on, you got to go for the gusto.  She's got to toss his salad.  If she just gives a hummer, or lets Tippy Tom do the Y, the ultimate rusty truck.  You guys are crazy.  That will never happen.  What, if she, uh.  She will never.  She's got to toss salad. 
[00:31:30]  I think tossing salad.  I think the odds are slim to none that she'll even just do the hum.  What if, what if we let Tippy Tom eat at the Y?  That's a fair worse for him.  That is, but it's funny as hell.  Well, where the hell is she?  He's not at home.  All right.  Well, Lady Di, you need to call the show immediately, okay?  And we'll take a break.  Oh, my God, that is disgusting.  He's just sitting on the Ikea furniture.  Screaming.  Screaming and yelling.  Ah!  He's barking. 
[00:32:00]  He's barking.  He likes you, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll continue with Tippy Tom next.  Opie Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Honduras.  Effin' Honduras.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's do it!  Let's do it! 
[00:32:30]  On our hotline, Anthony, the Iron Sheik.  Ah, pleasure for me.  He had a little trouble, I guess.  We spoke to a guy that works at a casino down in Atlantic City  and said that the Iron Sheik was getting a little intoxicated and boisterous  and had to be removed from the casino.  Well, we always give equal time here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  So, right now, the Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik, how are you doing?  Fine.  Thank you, Sir Rick.  How are you?  What a good, Iron Sheik. 
[00:33:00]  It's a pleasure for me to talk to you, Iron Sheik.  Oh, God bless you, first of all.  Do you think about the real champion from all this country in the world, Peresha or Iran.  I made it to the most famous city in the world, Madison Square Garden, New York,  and a single tag team, and I, yeah, God bless you, called me,  and I want to also say thank you to the last time that Javroni, my agent, Steve Chaplin, 
[00:33:30]  bring me over there, and with Eric Simpson, I want to say hello to all my resting friends.  God bless you.  You think about me and call me, Rick.  Talk to me.  Wow.  It's a pleasure for us, Iron Sheik.  A pleasure for us, Iron Sheik.  You're live on the radio with Opie and Anthony, of course,  and we heard that you had some problem in a casino last night.  Well, in the casino, people come in.  They were autographed, and then there was too many people, 
[00:34:00]  and they were in the street with Steve Chaplin, and there were road crews,  and then a thousand, thousand people were, and the officers said,  no, Sheik, you have to go, you cannot, the Manhattan street.  It was close.  Uh-huh.  Yes, sir, and all my Russian friends recognized the real Iron Sheik, Khosrow Vaziri,  from Iran, Tehran, and Shah Ahmed Rezaim.  I know that Khosrow Vaziri is here. 
[00:34:30]  I want to say, Rick, God bless you.  Think about me.  I'm training 90 degrees.  I'm going to come to the Manhattan, I hope, very soon.  And what was that place you played here in Manhattan?  Well, I go to the Broadway and my company, the World Wrestling Federation, WWF restaurant.  Right.  And usually, all my Russian friends come over, and I send a picture for them, make him happy,  because my boss, Mr. McMahon, greatest boss, and God bless his father, and his son, and Shane, 
[00:35:00]  and all his daughter, all intelligent people.  I want to say hello to everybody.  God bless you.  Think about me.  Iron Sheik, what was the big arena that you played in New York City?  Well, the biggest arena, the most famous arena, Madison Square Garden, New York, number one arena,  number one, Bosco in the world. 
[00:35:30]  Khedmata Hamishan, Avandgani, Iranian.  Salam Azbukram, Muhafak, Yadishomara, Rizal.  The most famous arena in the world is Madison Square Garden, New York, 24-hour city.  Yes, 24-hour city, New York.  Hey, didn't you fight the Hulk once?  Yes, sir.  I beat Mr. Bob Buckland six years.  Nobody beat him.  I included my best friend, Mr. Bruno Sammartino.  Yeah, where are you?  None of them beat him.  I beat him, and then I didn't feel good. 
[00:36:00]  I lost my belt to the Jabroni Hulk Hogan and Madison Square Garden, New York.  But didn't you eventually beat Hulk Hogan?  Yes, sir.  I can't beat him even right now.  Hulk Hogan is a guitar player.  He's not an Olympic wrestler.  He's not an AAU wrestler.  He's never been any competing in the Overseer Olympics.  He's an all-of-a-showman and a bodybuilder,  and he used the gimmick A to the Z himself, 
[00:36:30]  and he told the kids or nobody else to do it.  Yeah.  I beat the Jabroni in 85,  and I still can't beat him too.  Yes, sir.  I'm ready.  Now, if you were to get a fight with Hulk Hogan here in New York,  where would be the best place to do that so the most people could see it?  The most famous sereno in the world.  Which one is that?  Madison Square Garden, New York.  And I think it's in the heart of the Manhattan.  And if any Jabroni doesn't know about Madison Square Garden, New York, 
[00:37:00]  that means something wrong.  Right.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We're really not familiar with that room, Iron Sheik.  I'm sorry, sir.  Again, sir?  We're not really familiar with that room.  What room?  That garden room.  Oh, but I'll be honest with you, sir.  I born in Tehran, Iran,  the most oldest city in the world.  And all my brother was a wrestler. 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  Like what I'm going to do.  Roman Kato.  Roman Kato.  But I don't want to keep you too long.  Rek don't.  Rek don't and solve my intelligence, Baba.  I'm the real champion.  Not that you're running Hulk Hogan.  Right.  I want to say hello to all my rest of us  in the most famous city in the world.  Madison Square Garden, Manhattan, New York, Long Island,  all my students, especially Long Island. 
[00:38:00]  I want to say hello to all of them.  God bless them.  And on the next couple of weeks,  I hope my agents, Steve Chapman or the Jabroni Eric Sims,  maybe they invite me again.  Always a pleasure for me.  Always a pleasure.  And God bless you guys.  Think about me.  Pleasure for us, Iron Sheet.  Hey, Iron Sheet,  you ever meet Tippi Tom behind a dumpster?

I'm the individual Olympic gold medal.  Iron Sheet.  Iron Sheet.  Nikolai Volkov,  he fought,  what's that,  Sergeant Slaughter  here in New York.  I can't remember where that was, though.  Oh, well, usually,  Sergeant, I mean,  Nikola, myself,  talked to him  with the greatest manager in the world,  Mr. Harvard Fingono, 
[00:39:00]  and Mr. Fred Blassie  was my manager,  Nikolai Volkov.  Yeah.  We beat that all American boys.  They call him born U.S.  Mr. Mark Rotondo  and Mr. Barry Windham.  I remember I saw that Nikolai Volkov  and Sergeant Slaughter bout,  but I can't remember where that was  here in New York.  Well, Rick,  you should be intelligent,  and then a soldier,  myself,  the most,  the most famous match 
[00:39:30]  was a Cambod match,  Manisho Surigaard from New York.  And a soldier,  I know,  they call Cambod,  Cambod match.  That was  one of the most  wrestling history  that match.  Yes.  I remember that.  That was famous.  The memory of a goldfish.  Yeah.  Iron Sheik,  pleasure for us,  Iron Sheik,  to speak it to you.  Number one wrestler,  Greco-Roman,  from oldest country,  Iran,

[00:53:30]  You don't die of AIDS  You die of something else  You might get HIV  But, uh, you, uh, you, uh, you don't  I know people living 20 years old  That don't have, I mean, have AIDS  You don't die of AIDS  Dr. Tom!  You die of a cold  Right  What happens is it just, it, uh, it makes it so other things kill you 
[00:54:00]  Your immune system  Right  Is down  But so are you still, you might be afraid that if you keep having unprotected sex, you're going to get the AIDS  You get the AIDS  But it don't matter  You're not going to die alive  You're going to die of something else  That is a rationalization I have not yet heard  You're going to die of something  Living outdoors, don't you think you're going to get a cold?  On the street, you get shot in the head  Right  What are you going to do? 
[00:54:30]  You're behind a dumpster, you can get shot in the face  Yeah, right  If you're shot in the ass, that's even worse  You don't die of AIDS  Right, but it kind of helps the other diseases kill you, though  Exactly  So aren't you afraid of maybe  You're actually right  Aren't you afraid of maybe getting it and giving it to other people or something?  I don't know  I don't give it to other people  I'm sexual, old Barney  You just said two weeks ago  I'll say it again

You're getting Hepatitis C 
[00:55:30]  Yeah  Which I've had for 20 years  Oh, Jesus  You can't catch it from nobody  It just happens  You get it from food  They don't even know where you get it from  Your liver  You only got one liver  You got one heart  You got two eyes, two ears  Two arms, two legs  I'm sure the liver is three lobes  Which you can live with  It could become  You only got one liver  And, yes  I got liver cancer 
[00:56:00]  How many feet do you have?  And that is what I've been going on with  And  You got the liver cancer there, Tippi Tom?  Yeah  How'd you get that?  No, they put needles in my stomach  To pull out pieces  But I know I'm going to live another 30 years  Yeah?  Yeah  I told the doctor that  You better stop drinking, hon  Lady Di's telling Tippi Tom to stop drinking?  Are you insane?  No, I mean, if he has something wrong with his liver 
[00:56:30]  He shouldn't be drinking  Lady Di, look in the mirror  Yeah, take it easy, Lee Remick  I'm fine  I'm fine  Do it  Drinking ain't had nothing to do with it  No  Right  No, no, no  Drinking had nothing to do with it  Just keep drinking, Tom  It's not from drinking  That's what I say  Alright, well, let's let Lady Di go  No  Lady Di, you're not going to do anything with Tippi Tom?  I don't think so  I think the appliance is a good idea  Because you don't have to use anything  Yeah  There's no skin-to-skin contact 
[00:57:00]  The appliance is the best one  It's a strap-on type thing and it's safe  Well, we'll see  Okay  You know, that's something for me to decide  I hope he doesn't have tuberculosis  I mean, you know  What do you mean you need to decide?  Do you just sit down and talk with your family?  Just do it  No  Wait a minute  Hold on  Hold on  I will think of something before I go on the show tomorrow  That's the idea  I think that's the one  The thing  I think the little strap-on appliance is the best one 
[00:57:30]  Would you help me with that, Norton?  No, but it's not actually a section  Lady Di  What?  Come on, I'll stage now  Lady Di  Are you going to be  Guys, I will come up with something  Don't worry about it  Okay?

Nothing  Norton, you don't know that  I might have something  Then say it  What do you have?  What's someone going to do?  Steal it and make a sitcom out of it?  What do you have?  No  What do you have?  Say something  What do you have?  Well, like I said, I had the singing  That doesn't involve your stupid voice 
[00:59:30]  What do you have?  Okay, um  It doesn't involve my voice?  Singing, yeah  It doesn't involve singing  There's a few of the things I'm thinking about right now  No, there isn't  You're lying  I am not lying  Tell us one  Tell us one  Tell us one  Um, let me see  So you're just making it up  Um, let me see  Tell you one  Tell you one  Tell you one  An idea  And she's like thinking  That little brain just smoking  I am smoking  Come on, you little  I mean, my brain is smoking right now  My brain is smoking

With the ring on my nose  No  Wow  Rings on my ears, yes  But not rings on my nose  My lady, it's going to be kind of sad when we say goodbye to you  Wow  Well, don't worry about it  You know, I think we gave you some pretty good ideas with Tippi Tom  Yeah, stop thinking about what you can do to stay on the show 
[01:00:30]  Just think about a farewell  Think about a farewell speech  Because you're done  Is Tippi Tom going to be there tomorrow?  Doesn't matter  Doesn't matter to you  You said you wouldn't do anything with him  Yeah  Well, you know, I don't  I don't know  I mean, we have to see  Would you do the butt chug?

[01:01:00]  I'll think of something, don't worry  Tippi Tom is still alive  We're actually not worried, Lady Di  No one is worried  Well, I would definitely think of something for tomorrow  Don't worry about that  Let's do it!  Okay?  You haven't had anything, though  We just wanted some interesting radio tomorrow  Before we kick your ass out the door  Yeah  And we're not going to get it  We're not going to get it  I'm trying to help you  And all you're saying is  I can sing, I can dance  Look, you have no artistic ability  You're not going to sing and dance  And this isn't Star Search  You're not Shirley Temple  I never said it was Star Search  I didn't say anything  Who cares about singing and dancing?

Uh, without a doubt  Uh, what I'm saying, but I ain't quite figuring it out yet  Now, Tom, whatever you do, don't describe anything that you're seeing, please  I don't know nothing  Leave that to the professionals 
[01:20:00]  I don't, I know nothing  Wow  Alright, Tom  I just want to see what's going on here  I just want to see what's going on here  Why are you looking at the camcorder? Look at what's in front of you  I can't get in there, I gotta look for the camcorder  Alright, Tom  See what you're doing  Anyway, uh, I don't remember  Oh, the mic just got shut off  What's wrong, Tippy Tom?

Tom, take a look, man  It's not a shaver, it's a microphone, you idiot  We're hitting him a microphone and he thought it was a shaver  Take a look, Tom, just take a look 
[01:21:00]  When he went to go grab  He went to grab  Hey, Tom, what's wrong? Why are you leaving?  He's back later  What? What's wrong?  Oh, no, don't let him go into the bathroom alone  It's harder  Alright, what happened to Tom?  Where did Tom go?  He grabbed a mic  Did he grab a mic?  It comes out of his mind  You're an expert, baby  Wow  You know, I never remember using my drill quite that way when I was in the tin-knocking business 
[01:21:30]  We had the cordless drills and never saw that attachment  Look how nice they are to each other  There's kissing and all kinds of nurturing going on between these ladies  Wow  Oh, yeah  Oh, God, if it stuck, couldn't it just...  I don't know  Like, doesn't it have to...  You picture her just spinning around  Spinning around  Flop, flop, flop, flop

I'm not ready right now  I'm not ready  No, he's not  No?  No, he defecates in public  Yeah, but I think this is making him a little, uh...  He's not embarrassed  He's a little freaked out  He's a little freaked out  Yeah  Exactly  Is he going into the bathroom, you think?

Well, I don't know if he digs the chicks though  He dug the chicks 
[01:27:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, he had all be in his red hat  He looked so boyish with the blonde hair  Stop!  Like you've been rollerblading  This show is so gay  Stop!  I'm just speculating  You had the little things tied around the neck  I know with the gay, gay, gay stuff  We just sexed it up a little bit  And you've got to bring us right back into the gay zone  I'm just saying  Stop!  You've got a little color  Maybe he wants to kiss you on the cheeky side  Stop!  You know?  Holy Jesus  Geez  John Valby in the studio  Yeah

[01:28:00]  Alright, I forgot  Oh no  I forgot what happens when John Valby's in the studio  We get to play them  The next day  I forgot  Can someone check to see if we  All those were good words  Yeah  They were good  You know something?  I forgot  You would have been right  Probably two years ago  Stinky three dumps?  We've gotten so screwed lately  Even worse than the first time you came in 
[01:28:30]  Wow  I know it's even worse  Because people have this morality that they like to pour on and tell the FCC  Well, let's try another one  Alright  It's John Valby  Oh, his name is Robert Blake  And after he shot his wife  He should have hid the gun  Where OJ hid the knife  Unless he hires Johnny Cochran 
[01:29:00]  He's going to the slam  The name of his new tune will be  Big Bubba, you the man  Who gives a round  How about  Oh, her name is Britney Spears  And if she's a virgin, I'm a priest  Her box is still leaking NSYNC  Spunk, but for Rosie, that's a feast  That slutty little tramp has Ellen's weasel on her face  But if she did Jeff Gordon 
[01:29:30]  He might win another race  So give them a round  How about one more  Oh, his name is Mike Tyson  And here's the effin' deal  Everyone who gets in the ring with me  I treat like a happy meal  I bite their ears  I bite their legs  I give their mmm a ribbon  But after the last bite  I'm going back to beatin' women  And here's the hell 
[01:30:00]  I made it  I think most of that made it, right?  Yeah.  I hope so.  Stinky, could he report for us?  He'll come running in with his thumbs down, no.  All of that made it?  Wow.  I've been editing, I've been editing.  Yeah.  How about Agent Scully's bush is covered with crop circles?  Well, that's okay.  Here's a New York one  Here's a New York one 
[01:30:30]  Your sister went to my crotch to watch the ball drop  How about your sister played dead till the dog was done?  Oh, that's good, yeah.  Well, wait.  I don't know, I like that.  How about the old man told your sister it was pudding?  I don't know, I like that.  How about the old man told your sister it was pudding?  Yeah, that's fine.  How about Grandma ran over her nipple with her wheelchair? 
[01:31:00]  What is wrong with that?  That's great!  How about your mother can style a lawn mower in her bush hair?  Uh-oh, Stinky.  Oh no, Stinky, which one?  Stinky came in all dejected. How many dumps?  Just one, I think it was the bus seat.  Really?  For some reason you can't say the F word for the gas thing.  You gotta be kidding!  No, that's not true.  Maybe it's the S-U-C-K word. 
[01:31:30]  Maybe that's it.  I guarantee it's the F word for the gas.  Are you kidding me?  He dumps out every time we say it.  FART!  You can't say that?  Oh, what a baby, sweater vest boy!  Can't say that?  I'm sure Stinky will let us know if that made it. 
[01:32:00]  Did that make it?  That didn't make it?  Are you serious?  No.  Well, maybe.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  I'm trying so hard.  How about your grandma's face took a direct hit from the mule?  Yeah, okay, that'll make it.  What?  Your grandma's face?  Two before that.  Oh, stop it! 
[01:32:30]  Garrett.  Alright, thank you, Garrett.  Hi.  Hi, Garrett.  Thank you.  We gotta wait for our delay to build up a little.  It might sound like we're underwater again.  Damn!  Do you have a clean one over there, John?  You know, I got one.  I just played in Texas last night.  My old fort, Fort Hood, Texas.  Anyway, with the Paul McCartney marriage thing,  you got a limerick.  It kind of relates to Texas, too.  I don't know.  I've never tried it before.  Sure.  It goes, 
[01:33:00]  When Heather McCartney goes to bed, she unscrews it.  And Sir Paul finds it hard to refuse it.  And why can't he stop?  To paraphrase ZZ Top,  she's got a leg, and she knows how to use it.  I'm going home early.  What's the matter, Opie?  I'm going home early.  I mean, you guys started the show with kicking people in the nuts.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  And then this Tom guy, I mean, man.  I know.  And I can't say the F-A-R-T word.  Isn't that ridiculous?  I don't even think you could spell it.  Oh.  The F-C is disgraceful.  People are saying that Jimmy Norton actually said it, and they heard it.  Wow.  Because he just said it.  Maybe if you use it in any way, shape, or form.  Boy, why don't you button up your vest and run in and explain why we can't say that.  Hey, tippy-tom.  Hey, what I'm saying is this.  Is that Mike going on?  Tom, he's got a headache right now, and he want to sit down. 
[01:34:00]  Tom, say hoo-ah.  Yeah.  Hoo-ah.  Yeah.  Hoo-ah.  Ozzie.  All right.  What I'm saying is this is that I want to kind of like take back five minutes by myself.  You got a pop with that?  What's that guy doing?  What the hell y'all doing over here? 
[01:34:30]  Tom, how many beers are you having?  Messing up with tippy-tom.  Tippy-tom.  Want to go downstairs?  Yeah.  He'd be bugging me.  I'm going to sit downstairs.  Hey, tippy-tom from New Orleans.  Did you like the girls?  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  You like the show they were putting on?  That was nice.  I like the guys, too.  Hey.  Hey, we're getting a request for John Velve.  Do you think he's cute?  Shut up! 
[01:35:00]  He's a good-looking guy.  He's all right.  I don't know.  He could see where he could have gotten.  He could get to know him a little better.  He's got to get to know you.  What do you think of Jim Norton?  What do you think of him over there?  Look, I've been a faggot for years.  Now, what I'm saying is this.  Is it?  Yes.  He's a very handsome, cute man.  He is, right?  Opius.  So, you.  Thank him.  You.  Oh, he likes Keith, too, huh?  I'm good-looking girls, too.  What about him? 
[01:35:30]  Now, what I'm saying is this.  What about him?  Is I want to go downstairs and sit in there.  He won't show me a way to get the hell out of here.  Why do you want to?  Hey, we gave you beer and stuff and wanted you to hang out.  I just want to sit down by myself, bro.  Aw, is that it?  All right.  Is that it?  Too many people?  What is wrong with that?  Too many people hanging around, maybe getting a little...  Yeah, I just let my head settle.  Right.  You've got to unwind a little.  All them chicks down there, naked.  What are you guys doing?  No, wait a minute. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  Bye, Tom.  All right, Tom.  Have fun.  Hey, we're getting requests for John Valby's songs.  Someone wants you to do the Bin Laden song that we were playing like crazy on our show.  What the hell happened to me?  There it is.  A little drum.  We've got to figure out how to make this go back there. 
[01:36:30]  This is unbelievable.  This is one of those things.  This whole show is drunken.  I don't know.  Did you buy this on the way over?  This is your piano.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, this is your keyboard.  Remember, it didn't work in the beginning?  Yeah.  All right, let's get Pete back in here.  Because now all it's doing is...  Are you hitting me?  Rip shocks.  Lizzie's just making drum sounds. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  Let's do an acapella.  The mother is a knothead.  The father is a pothead.  The kids are all just poop heads.  The Osborn family.  Da-da-da-da.  Oh, my God.  This piano is now just set as a percussion instrument.  All right, Steve's trying to figure it out.  Tibby Tom has to go, Anthony.  He had to leave?  Yeah.  Oh, there we go.  There we go. 
[01:37:30]  We come from Alabama, but we're in Afghanistan.  We're Navy SEALs and Green Berets hunting for a man.  They say he has a bearded face, a diaper on his head.  I heard we won't be going home until the epper's dead.  Oh, Bin Laden, no, don't you die too quick.  I've come to F your fanny with some anthrax on my junk. 
[01:38:00]  When Osama's finally captured, let's not cut off his dork.  Let's handcuff both his testicles and drag him to New York.  There, we'll contact firemen, turn on a power hose.  Screw it to his sphincter till the oomt comes out his nose.  Oh, Bin Laden, no, don't you die too quick.  I've come to F your fanny with some anthrax on my stick.  Oh, I realize that prison food replied to give him gas. 
[01:38:30]  So I said, let's launch a bunker buster up his na-na-na.  Oh, I, I, I, you have to fake me gag.  You're like ten pounds of camel pee in a nine-pound bag.  I believe everything got through.  You did a fine job of self-editing yourself.  That one made it.  All right.  Everyone's giving you a thumbs up. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Thumbs up stink.  All right.  There you go.  Wow.  Ben looks like he's been through a war.  You all right, Ben?  Just taking it all in?  Okay.  I'm just checking.  I'm really glad I flew up from Texas for today.  You know, this is like a memoir day.  Well, it happens, you know.  Sometimes this place is like an insane asylum.  Well, we might be setting the dump record today.  Oh, yeah, with Tippy Tom.  With the Tippy Tom.  Yeah.  John Valby and three lesbians doing what they were doing?  Oh, yeah.  I bet there was some entertainment, though. 
[01:39:30]  Well, I sure hope so.  I don't think anybody would describe what the girls are doing this time.  Thank God.  Except for Tom.  Tippy Tom.  He's reaching over and touched off.  I hope they get all kinds of AIDS tests.  Just being touched by him.  Did you see his fingernails?  He's walking around the studio with lights off.  Oh, Ben, you can't spray too much of that, though.  Yeah, but you want to...  It gets really bad.  I think John Valby has one more in him.  Do you got another one?  A few more, right?  Oh, I don't know.  He's disgusted. 
[01:40:00]  You know, the one I'd really like to do is that Boston one.  No, no pedal.  Father Pedophilia  Picks up a kid in a vestibule after the mass  Christens his ass  Later that evening  Corners an altar boy in the confessional booth 
[01:40:30]  Baptizes his tooth  All those Catholic perverts  Where do they all come from?  All those church donations  Pumped up some young boy  Cardinal Denial  Cardinal Denial  Transfers the priest to a parish  That's right down the street  It's full of fresh meat 
[01:41:00]  Bishop McBugger  Passing communion  With one hand still under his frock  Pounding his butt  All those pervert clerics  Let's throw them in the clink  All those Irish Catholics  No wonder why they drink  Oh my goodness  Bravo!  Hey! 
[01:41:30]  I'm just waiting for the thumbs up from Stinky  I think most of that made the error  Really?  Yes, I think so  That was great  What, you thinking one dump?  I don't know  I'm thinking one dump  Thumbs up!  Wow!  Yes!  Yeah!  We're doing better  God bless the FCC  Wow!  Look at that  Very nice  Yeah, that went through  Now John, where are you playing again tonight?  In Danbury, right?  Danbury Tuxedo Junction  Tomorrow in Rascals  West Orange  Next Thursday, Mulcahy's 
[01:42:00]  Long Island  Long Island  I love when John makes it out to Long Island  Oh yeah  There's some sick crowds out there  Oh yes, absolutely  Rocking it  You gonna stick around for a little more or what?  Well, I really should  Get out of here  I should leave  Leave your piano that doesn't work  I should leave with my dignity  And get the hell out of here  It was a very interesting afternoon  We can't do the gangbang song  Jesus  People request songs that  You can't do the gangbang? 
[01:42:30]  No, I don't think we'd be able to get away with the gangbang  Are there any that you believe we could get away with?  Let me see  I like when he does something with all our names and stuff  Oh, you mean the Hey Lotties?  Yeah, that's fine  Want me to write a few down for you?  Sure, write a few names  Alright, and maybe we can go out with this  Give me a pen there  Alright  Hey Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie Lottie L 
[01:43:00]  I don't like the, um, that C word for product.  Oh.  Yeah, they get real, yeah, look at Stinky comes in with the thumbs down, yeah.  Even Stinky at this point looks like a beaten man. 
[01:43:30]  Uh, what they do, I know a guy, his name is Stinky.  Body lock.  Tom's junk's the size of his little pinky.  Yeah.  I know a guy, his name is Ben.  Hey, Lottie, Lottie.  I've been popping his sister since she was 10.  Hey, Lottie.  Lottie, Lottie.  Hey, Lottie.  What are you laughing at?  I know.  You know, we're just going to get me in big trouble. 
[01:44:00]  I don't want to get it.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, it's just, if you can't say the real thing, it's just disappointing.  Isn't it?  It is.  And then you have a bunch of people with their stupid morality.  Ugh.  Fake.  People want us to spell your last name.  Valby.  V-A-L-B-Y.  That's it.  All this stuff all over the internet.  Yeah.  The real versions.  Yes, the real versions.  And you've got to see them live.  Because that's a party and a half, man. 
[01:44:30]  How many CDs do you have out?  Oh, probably 15, 16, 17.  That's correct.  Pick them all up at the live shows.  You have them available there.  And then at the end of the show, one of my favorite things, when you bring the girls up to help sing on stage.  Oh, yes.  Barnacle Bill to say.  Barnacle Bill.  And they give the whole crowd a little show.  Oh, it's kind of like you had your own Barnacle Bill here today, only they can't see it.  Yeah.  Really.  Well, we'll have pictures.  Yeah, we've got some great video of Tippy Tom. 
[01:45:00]  Okay.  For everybody to enjoy.  We've got to leave on a high note.  Yeah, I know.  I don't want to leave on a downer.  You know.  Twing Bill.  You can't say that word?  No.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Jesus.  That is actually one of the seven deadly words there.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  And it started off so nice, John.  It was probably right back to...  Wiz?  Can I say Wiz?  Wiz?  It depends what you're going to say after you say that. 
[01:45:30]  Twinkle, twinkle, stream of whiz.  All my beers have come to this.  Bubbles in the parking lot.  Little river steaming.  Twinkle, twinkle, left and right.  Tiffy Tom whizzing in the happy night.  I think that was good. 
[01:46:00]  Stinky.  Can we confirm it?  Wiz.  Come to this.  Come to this.  I see some people shaking their heads.  I don't know.  Are we going to get the official word?  The confirmation is...  Here he comes.  Here he comes.  Here he comes.  And he's walking around.  Thumbs up.  Thumbs up.  Wait, no.  Stinky's giving a thumbs down.  Wiz didn't make it?  Which one didn't make it?  The last...  What? 
[01:46:30]  You'd missed it.  The dump is going down.  So it's almost...  It was a dump in the last...  Don't get feisty with me, young man.  There's that guy in the hidden room over there.  Look at Stinky.  He's a beaten man.  He's getting all pissed off at us.  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  All right.  Well, I guess that's...  Is there anything else?  He's looking at his notebook.  Your mother holds the record at the clinic.  She makes money down on her knees. 
[01:47:00]  After she's finished, she sneezes.  So what's one more airborne disease?  Please.  Stop.  It's not going to get...  It's not going to get the big finish, though.  Yeah.  It was a cute little rhyme, and it probably made the air.  Isn't it so frustrating?  Oh.  Oh, little town of Bethlehem.  No, that won't make it.  I love it.  I love the thought process that goes into this.  Yeah.  Because if you see his act, you know that there's a little chance of any of it making the air. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  But he's just a good guy to have around.  Then we can't...  We present him in the light that he is...  I love watching him sweat, though, as he tries to figure it out.  He's turning the pages.  Oh, no.  Just got home from...  Nick of all those happy faggots down in South Lock 4.  They banged me in the shower.  Must have took an hour.  But there's goo-goo-goo.  Goo-goo-goo. 
[01:48:00]  I bet you...  Stinky?  What's the verdict?  No.  Come on.  Three dumps.  Three dumps.  Forget it.  Forget it.  Well, John, I appreciate the fact that you come in and give it a try.  Just take our word for it.  John Valby, very funny.  Yeah.  That was funny.  That was really funny.  I like how it's fizzing. 
[01:48:30]  Well, there's goo-goo.  God, bastards.  They didn't let goo-goo-goo?  Well, it was because where it was, yeah, where it was.  If you take the whole song as a whole, then there's a problem.  Literally.  Yeah, there's a lot of problems.  God damn.  Well, John, you know, I mean, thank you for coming in, at least, and giving it that try like you always do. 
[01:49:00]  You're a trooper when it comes to this.  And go see them live so you know what the hell you're missing on this show.  Danbury tonight, Rascals tomorrow night, and Mulcahy's next Thursday on Long Island.  John Valby.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  I think.  Thank you. 
[01:49:30]  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with this rapidity.  Mindless.  Clutch rabbits.  Anthony.  Mindless.  Crotch grabbing.  Anthony.  People grabbing their crotches and saying, suck it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Suck it.  Law of the show.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:50:00]  We're up to 31 dumps for the program today, Anthony.  31 times the show has been dumped out of today.  Does anyone know the record for the Opie and Anthony Show?  It's got to be close to that, huh?  Do you think it was in the 50s, Rick?  I think it's in the 50s.  I think I have the sheet back in the office.  Oh, wow.  I think it was a two-sheeter that day.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  In front of me, Opie, I have up a picture from the WNEW website here in New York. 
[01:50:30]  I guess anyone else can just go to opieandanthony.com.  And it is a picture of a contestant, our first contestant from the Best Wow Contest.  The only contestant so far.  Our only contestant.  What about all those pictures we brought back from Boston?  Columbo's not here today to put them up.  No, he's putting them up right now.  Oh, he is putting them up.  Okay.  I was going to say, if no one else enters, she wins five grand. 
[01:51:00]  Well, the lady's got a few weeks to get in on this, obviously.  But you can see our first contestant.  What's her name?  She's beautiful from Sacramento.  From KXOA in Sacramento, of course.  Remember the bevy of beauties we got from Sacramento?  The ringers for the Naughty Nighty contest.  And as I look at her picture, I'm noticing nice shadowing, a red light coming in from her left side.  Some filtering going on with the lighting. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, it's like almost the light of a sunrise on her.  Very nice.  She's got the pierced ones.  Door knockers, yeah.  The door knocker things, which I am not a big fan of.  Anthony?  I don't like the piercings, but she wears them well.  She's got a pimple.  Where's that?  Oh, a little blemish on the left one?  A little pimple.  You're going to be picky?  Yes.  Hold yourself.  There's a pimple.  Well. 
[01:52:00]  Who cares?  Don't go away.  I guess he's looking right here.  There's a little pimple.  That you notice?  Yes.  You're awful.  She's beautiful.  I don't like the pierced ones because they, see how it makes them look?  They're constantly like in that aroused state.  Oh, that's terrible.  I don't, no, it is.  If they're constantly like that. 
[01:52:30]  Don't you like them to sometimes be just normal?  No.  No.  I'm not a pierced fan, though.  I agree with you on that one.  No, you want to know when you're making that happen.  When you're making it work.  No, I don't.  I'll just make the assumption that it's whenever I'm touching it.  You don't want them, maybe if you run your hand over them, to just feel totally soft for a little bit.  Do you understand my ineptness?  Yeah, I'm asking the wrong person.  Opie, I'm with you.  I'm totally with you.  Yeah, like sometimes if you run your hand over it and it's just all soft at first and then you start feeling it coming around. 
[01:53:00]  And then you go, look what I did.  Look what I did now.  Look what I did here now.  Look what I did.  So you're in the humiliating condition.  Like it was yesterday.  But it's today.  Today, so close to yesterday.  Anyway, the WOW contest is on.  The three awesome blondes, we got their pictures taken.  Most of them.  Oh, really?  So they entered the WOW contest.  We're putting their pictures up.  What city are they representing? 
[01:53:30]  They're not from New York, huh?  D.C.  D.C.  representing.  Yeah.  All right.  Basically, the ladies, if they want in on this contest, we got $5,000 up for grabs.  Courtesy of risquevideo.com, Anthony.  By the way, that's $5,000.  I don't think people hear.  $5,000 to do what you want with.  Risquevideo.com, R-I-S-Q-U-E, video.com.  Check them out, okay?  Yeah.  And all the ladies have to do is show up at the station they hear us on.  And someone is waiting with the fine digital camera. 
[01:54:00]  They'll take your shots.  They mail them to us.  And we put all the shots up on opianthony.com.  Eventually, the listeners will vote for the best WOW.  Easy peasy.  And the shots we took of that girl in Boston.  Ah.  You guys got to see these pictures.  Which one will you see?  The cafe latte.  No, she's Puerto Rican and Italian.  Well, she got a...  Oh, please.  Puerto Rican and Italian is black.  Look, I'm not saying that she's not built for prison.  I'm just saying she's Puerto Rican and Italian.  Well, she looked black. 
[01:54:30]  No, she did.  She looked cafe latte black.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  I'm not saying there is.  I'm just saying that she's Puerto Rican and Italian.  Have you corresponded with her at all, Jim?  She made that clear in an email, yes.  What did she do?  All I know is I was leaving BCN Studios after the show and I looked down and Jim's like, E-A-T-R-B-U-L.  And she's writing down, you know, some words.  And then I see that at thing in there.  So I know it's an email address.  You know what the awful...  This is absolutely true. 
[01:55:00]  She wants nothing to do with me sexually.  A lot of women will email you and just say, hey, whatever.  Nothing to do with me sexually.  It annoys me.  Now you have a goal, though.  So that's what you do.  You're a conqueror.  She's hot, man.  Pictures are hot.  All right.  So go to opandanthony.com for the WOW contest.  And New York, you know, what are we going to do?  We've got to give them an incentive because this happens every time.  The New York women are completely jaded.  They have taken this show for granted.  The guys, you know, we saw at the stapler contest, they pour in. 
[01:55:30]  We say anything.  Hey, we're going to pull your toenails out with pliers.  Dude, count me in.  The chicks?  Hello?  $5,000 up for grabs to come down here and have a fantastic picture of your bosoms taken for the WOW contest.  You could win $5,000 if you're proud of your breasts and think they look nice enough to win when the audience votes.  So some incentive.  First chick to come down to see us live here in New York and enters the WOW contest. 
[01:56:00]  We'll get Incubus tickets.  Incubus.  The sold-out show at the Garden.  Sold-out.  Where is it?  Madison Square Garden.  Greatest arena in the world.  The Madison Square Garden is greatest.  This is Aaron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  Pleasure for me today.  Anthony and Opion bring me here to New York. 
[01:56:30]  I say hello to all my wrestling friends.  And everybody knows, I'm the real Middle Eastern man.  Come to the greatest wrestling country.  And most famous city in the world.  Manhattan, Madison Square Garden.  I've come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling friends.  Especially All-American.  And also my Iranian friend.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling friends. 
[01:57:00]  I want to say hello to all my wrestling friends.  I want to say hello to all the world.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling friends.  Pleasure for me to come back here again one more time to talk to the Opion and Anthony.  And pleasure for me always.  Opion.  I never understood why he says that.  That never gets old.  Opion.  Hey, Paul.  What's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Just wanted to have things going with your new co-worker.  Who?  John Minnelli.  Ah.  Yes.  You guys must be very excited. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  The radio station here in New York City has hired a consultant.  Are you trying to trash him already, John?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We're happy.  Are you making jokes, Paul?  No, no, not at all, not at all.  Yeah, they hired John Minnelli to consult this place.  Bob Grant used to make it.  I recognize the name.  I'm like, where do I know that from?  But he was on Bob Grant's station.  I used to.  Yeah.  Minnelli.  It's John Minnelli.  He's going to make some suggestions.  We'll see what happens.  He's looking for new shows.  That's right. 
[01:58:00]  And I don't know.  We're going to try to get this place together.  Get this going.  Get some fire stoked in this place.  That's all.  Hey, Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  You suck, Norton.  Hi, sir.  Thank you.  Guys, I want to tell you, I've been listening to your show on hold.  I tried to call in about Captain Kangaroo before.  Yes.  And, dude, let me tell you, this show on hold is a hundred times funnier than it is live.  You guys should just have a dump special.  Unfortunately, yeah, you heard a lot if you were on hold.  I was on hold for like 45 minutes.  I couldn't hang up because I was laughing so hard. 
[01:58:30]  There was 31 dumps so far.  I think it happened with Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  Oh, you heard when he said he wanted to F her face.  And I almost died.  I swear to God, I almost died.  All right, cool.  Guys, you suck.  I'm punching out.  Thank you, man.  Hey, Jim, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  I wanted to give you a 10-second imitation of what we've heard today.  Okay.  It went something like this.  Tippi Tom, what do you think of?  Wait a second.  Hold it.  Dump.  Dump.  Play again.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Wait. 
[01:59:00]  Wait.  Hold it.  Hold it.  It's been just great.  Just great radio.  God, you guys suck.  We thought June 7th was bad.  That is so true.  I was like, okay, Tippi Tom, you want to talk about it?  No, no, no.  Get him away.  Get him away.  It was more like this, though.  Yeah, I think, Tippi Tom, you can say what you want to say.  All right.  Here I am.  We have confidence that you know the rules of radio.  Ah!  No, no.  Get him away.  Get him away.  It's the worst catastrophe I've ever seen.  Oh, no. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, no.  I've got to tell you a little story.  This guy, it's a sucks-to-be-you story out of Birmingham, Alabama.  A woman enraged at her boyfriend, attacks him with a utility knife, cut off nearly all  of his buttocks.  What?  Yeah, usually it's the other side, leaving him near death on a dark rural road.  Injuries were so severe, the investigators initially believed the victim was sexually  tortured and dragged behind a car in a possible hate crime.  The man has not fully described what happened, but him and his girlfriend, who acted alone 
[02:00:00]  in this crime, had an argument at a bar.  And Kimberly King, 26, of Aliceville, Alabama, was jailed and said, this ain't right.  That was her comment.  She told TV crews that she was arrested.  This ain't right.  What are you doing while someone is stabbing your balloon knot?  Don't you move or fight back?  She apparently had a big utility knife and stabbed him. 
[02:00:30]  He fell down on his stomach, and she started carving his entire rear end off.  Like, I'm going to tear up your ass.  And she did.  She cut off.  I have never heard of that.  Usually women turn around and, you know, pull the bobbet on their guys if they're giving  the women some crap.  But, Al, that is a sucks to be you.  When your chick cuts off your ass. 
[02:01:00]  Dude, your chick cut off your ass.  I don't think you'll ever win another argument for the rest of your life.  Right.  Right.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Rob.  From Reno.  Hey, hey.  The first.  Hey, I was just wondering when we were going to get some wild stickers and stuff out here.  The first official caller from Reno.  Listening to us on the Hawk.  On the Hawk.  On the Hawk.  Classic rock that really rocks.  The Hawk.  You're listening to the Hawk. 
[02:01:30]  Here's Ted Nugent.  Cat Scratch Fever.  Do classic rock stations play Cat Scratch Fever?  Hell yeah, man.  That's classic rock that rocks.  Classic rock that rocks.  Rocks.  The Hawk.  Anyway, Rob, what?  You want wild stickers?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Is that up to the stations?  See, you're going to have to stay on these guys because they're going to be, like, more 
[02:02:00]  closely affiliated to, like, you know, your New Orleans station there.  Rob, it's really quick.  It's real easy.  If you want to participate in WOW, just make the homemade WOW sign.  Well, yeah.  I drive a truck.  I got it written in the dirt on the back of my trail.  Yeah, that works.  All right.  Right on.  All right.  We got to go because we got to get the lead out.  You guys have a good one.  On the Hawk.  It's not going to work, sir.  Classic rock that really rocks.  Cat Scratch Fever. 
[02:02:30]  Ted Nugent.  On the Hawk.  Classic rock that rocks.  Rockin' Reno.  Ha, ha, ha.  Rockin' Reno.  I usually don't hear it.  Like, I would kind of enjoy hearing this on a classic rock station.  They usually play the same old stuff.  What's around here?  This is classic rock that rocks. 
[02:03:00]  It's time for the 5 o'clock traffic jam.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  On the Hawk.  What's with the rock stations playing a lot of old stuff nowadays?  What is that all about?  It used to just be, you know, you could go to a station like, what, K-Rock or anything,  and they used to just add in some Zeppelin, and what else did they put in there?  Maybe some Floyd.  Hendrix.  Hendrix. 
[02:03:30]  Now it's like just, I'm waiting to hear CCR.  Have they just run out of new music?  Is that what happened?  Dude, all the new music stinks.  Well, coming from you.  Except for, I know, Ozzy.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's funny.  Everybody's been teasing me about Ozzy, and you know what?  What's happened in the last six months?  The whole stupid country now is on the North.  Oh, it's nothing about his music.  It doesn't matter.  It's the whole vibe, man.  Oh, you picked up on that before people had watched it in his house?  You know what, even, hold on, hold on. 
[02:04:00]  Even with all that marketing he got with that show, his record sales stink.  Doesn't matter, because the people are stealing the internet.  They're downloading everybody's stuff.  They're not interested in Ozzy's music.  They're interested in seeing Ozzy look like a complete idiot on TV.  No, you're completely wrong.  Hold on.  It's the whole Ozzy vibe.  I'm saying music, who he is, all of it makes him Ozzy shit.  No one knew.  So, 99% of people, especially even Ozzy fans, never knew Ozzy was like that.  Anyway, I have interviews from him from Detroit, and like, before Randy died, like the early 
[02:04:30]  80s, where he's drunk on the air.  I've known Ozzy was like that.  Yeah, that's fine.  That's rock star drunk, not poor father walking around his house drunk.  But they're all into the whole vibe now.  You think?  No, dude, they are.  I've been loving Ozzy for all these years.  No, his record sales stink.  The whole reason they did the TV show with Sharon wanted to do this TV show was to help  his record sales.  Promote the album.  Exactly.  Dude, you talk about the internet, then why did Eminem, why is Eminem already over 2 million?  In three weeks, he's at 2.4 million.  Oh, boy. 
[02:05:00]  And he was already all, that was all, if you're saying, that album was available on the internet.  That's because we played with.  Ozzy's album up to Earl, that even sell a million copies, it was a bomb.  You're delusional.  Cracked a million.  Dude, it was a bomb.  It was because of the show.  The last one that just came out.  I don't know.  With all the marking that he got for his name, for his music, that's a disgrace.  Hours of commercial time on MTV, which is the record-buying public, and still couldn't  cut it.  Ozzy and Eminem, come on, man.  I mean, I like Eminem, but when he's doing it 20 or 30 years after he starts, then come 
[02:05:30]  talk to me.  I don't want to hear about any music.  I don't like that excuse you.  That's a stupid excuse.  I don't like that one, too.  Some of these bands should give up after a few years.  Ozzy's phenomenal.  You guys know that.  I think Ozzy is, but you know something, I'm going to be the first one to say this.  Here comes my announcement.  First, I think I'm the first person that has said this.  I'm feeling the Osborne overexposure.  Of course.  I'm feeling the Osborne overexposure.  I doubt the second season of the Osborne is going to do well. 
[02:06:00]  It's just going to stay.  It's going to be a bomb.  It's going to be a huge mistake.  Because now I've noticed the kids aren't acting like themselves, like in that awkward first  couple of episodes.  Now they're kind of pros at it, and they're kind of showing off.  You see them on the interview shows and on the MTV award shows, and they're all like playing  the characters that are themselves.  The reason the Osborne's worked so well is because they were all so innocent.  Yeah, now it's...  What?  There was a lot of innocence as far as that show went. 
[02:06:30]  It was real.  They weren't used to being on TV.  It was taped, and they threw it on MTV.  They weren't expecting it to be just a monstrous hit.  And now, like Anne said, now that it is a monstrous hit, they're playing to the cameras more,  and they're overdoing it.  Every shot now, the daughter...  I'll tell you what every shot is.  Ozzy looking all silly and stupid, maybe putting his Ozzy monster face on.  Sharon looking in control.  She's got to make that look.  The daughter looking like she doesn't want to be there.  And the son looking all like crazy. 
[02:07:00]  That's like every picture now of them is like that, because that's what everyone expects  of them.  At least they took a year to get to that point.  But Tommy Lee is talking about people, hey, maybe they should film me.  Nobody wants...  You know how long it would take him to ham it up?  30 seconds.  You know what, though?  Once you bang Cam Anderson on camera, nobody wants to see your next part.  They film a kid falling in the pool.  I'm going to...  I'm watching that one.  God, why didn't I think that?  Unfortunately, because of the success of the Osbournes, you're going to see a lot of these  shows.  Of course you will, because they stink. 
[02:07:30]  They're all going to fail in comparison, but the second season of the Osbournes is going  to be awful.  It may not be as good, but I think it'll still be good.  It's going to be awful.  It won't be awful.  And this just in, there's going to be an entire collection of the Osbournes toys...  As there should be.  ...that are coming out.  I guess action figures, is that what's happening?  A little overexposure.  I hope to help this side of the deal.  You're delusional to think everyone's into Ozzy because of who he is.  No, no, no.  They're into him because of what they get to see on TV.  What I'm saying is...  He's a mess, Jim.  I don't care why.  He's a mess, and people love to get a peek at that. 
[02:08:00]  But you know what?  He's honest enough to let people see him.  They're giggling and laughing when they show the concert footage of Ozzy.  He doesn't compare to 10, 15 years ago.  Well, where was Leno five years ago?  Where was Leno five years ago?  Jim, he can't even move on stage.  Dude!  You know that people watch that show to laugh at him?  So what?  If life was fair, Ozzy would have been dead in 1984.  He's had all these years of shooting Demerol, and he's still going.  I don't care what he does anymore.  I had to buy my Ozzy Osbourne Happy Meal from McDonald's.  That's coming soon. 
[02:08:30]  It's just annoying.  That's the point.  Everybody jumps on this Ozzy bandwagon now, and it's like people have liked him.  I could have told you this 20 years ago.  They're not jumping on the same bandwagon as you.  Yes, they are.  They're not discovering his music for the most part.  They're not buying his new music.  They're looking at him on TV because he looks ridiculous.  What percentage would you say of people that watch the Osbournes actually know who Black Sabbath is?  Hard to say because a lot of people that are way too young were like, you know,  Black and Borderlands guys that may not have listened to Ozzy before. 
[02:09:00]  Less than 10%.  No, less than 10%.  Come on.  Stop.  Of the whole audience watching the Osbournes, you'd think more than 10%?  I would say less than 10%.  Know who Black Sabbath is?  Yeah, I would say less than 10%.  35%.  Know who Sabbath is?  You're insane.  They're not fans.  You're insane.  They're not super fans like you, Jim.  I would even say.  They're crazy.  They don't know who Sabbath is.  They don't know what Sabbath is.  Sure they do.  No, they don't.  The average kids that watch MTV that are watching Eminem have no idea who Black Sabbath is.  Absolutely they do.  No, they don't. 
[02:09:30]  They may not be fans.  They may not be out of the name songs, but they know who they are.  Dude, they know Eminem.  They know System of a Down.  They know Korn.  They know those bands.  They don't know any of them.  Because these bands, they're all on Sabbath tribute albums.  All these bands have done nothing but pay homage to Sabbath.  Sabbath, Sabbath, Sabbath, Sabbath, Sabbath, Sabbath, Sabbath.  You are amazing, too.  Dude, it's true.  You love.  They're all on Sabbath tribute albums.  They all do a System of a Down.  All these guys have done Sabbath covers.  All of them have done Sabbath covers.  When's the last time Ozzy did a System of a Down cover?  Never. 
[02:10:00]  Look at him, man.  He's fallen off his chair.  You're insane.  Ben just fell off his chair.  He's laughing so hard.  You're absolutely insane.  I'm not.  I do have a great Ozzy singing Stayin' Alive.  That's phenomenal.  That's a cover of Bee Gees.  Ozzy did, which was very acceptable.  You're insane.  I'm right.  You're insane.  I'm 100% right.  Well, I see this more.  I hate to tell you, but there are better bands than Ozzy.  Better bands than Black Sabbath.  You know what?  Yeah, the Beatles was a better band.  I like Sabbath better, but the Beatles was better than Sabbath.  I mean, I'm not dumb.  I know that.  But who else is better?  The Who?  That overrated, annoying...  My g-g-g-g-g-gator... 
[02:10:30]  All right.  I'm not!  That's a completely different animal.  Led Zeppelin.  Led Zeppelin.  They're a great band.  Overrated in comparison to Sabbath because...  Oh, my God.  Because the critics like them because of what they sang about as opposed to Sabbath who was really  dark and autumn.  The critics really didn't like Zeppelin that much.  But they hated Sabbath.  Well, yeah.  They did not like Zeppelin at the time either.  They thought they were devil worshippers.  Are you going to tell me that Sabbath shouldn't be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame what should  be fireboxed?  sending anthrax, please. 
[02:11:00]  That's the first place you should send it.  How is Sabbath not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  How are they not?  These pukey, like, Rolling Stern, Stone people.  Just because...  Rolling Stern, he says.  These pukey, Rolling Stern people.  What are you talking about?  No, you don't think Sabbath is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame much.  Because they've been around so long?  No, but they can sell out and start singing ballads?  If there's somebody around that has been around for years,  they should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  I'm saying because the stuff was great.  Every album was different.  Maybe it wasn't, thankfully. 
[02:11:30]  Volume 4, Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, Master Reality.  Come on, any paranoia, everybody knows.  The original Black Sabbath,  or even some stuff off of Attempted Glacius to See or Never Say Hi.  What's the criteria for being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Apparently, it's wearing robes and being a faggot  and selling out and doing ballads for films.  Apparently, that's the criteria.  What band are you talking about?  No, I'm just saying in general.  Are you talking about Aerosmith?  No, I'm just generalizing.  You are.  Or have died in the 70s.  If you died in the 70s, you're accepted in.  Well, bottom standard, I'd vote him out. 
[02:12:00]  Aerosmith did a few ballads.  Who cares?  But they also rocked for many, many years.  I like Aerosmith.  I do like Aerosmith.  I get pissed off when people say Aerosmith sold out.  You can hate their music now or something,  but how can you fault a band that nearly killed themselves with drugs?  I like that.  And once they came back, think that they should do it again?  It's like the drunk friend that has the other friend that went on the wagon  and is all pissed off that they're not still drinking.  Right.  You've got to give it to Aerosmith and let them just do what they do now.  If they're making money hand over fist, writing ballads, writing movie soundtracks, 
[02:12:30]  you don't have to like it or listen to it, but you can't fault them and go,  they should be doing drugs in their Learjet and writing crappy tunes  and performing them like crap live.  I agree.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  I'm not knocking Aerosmith.  My point is, what doesn't bother me is not Aerosmith or any band.  It's the perception by people who vote you in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It's these arrogant, stupid critics.  See Ozzy's new video?  No, I don't watch it.  The little girls and the snow falling?  No.  Although, I Just Want You is one of the best videos I've ever seen.  That probably got three plays on it. 
[02:13:00]  Of course it is.  And the song, the new song, the hit that's out is very hokey.  I think to get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, you have to have a little longevity,  and there wasn't a lot of longevity with Black Sabbath.  There was ten years.  That's getting there.  They did great stuff, man.  They did great stuff.  Some of the riffs, come on.  How can anybody question?  I owe me riffs.  Hi, Booba.  Hi, Sugar Bear.  How are you guys?  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up, Ozzy?  I just want to say, I appreciate Jimmy, you know, sticking up for me. 
[02:13:30]  I love him, you know.  I just want to say, though, I kind of agree myself that I'm a little overexposed, you know.  Yeah.  No, it's because I've been doing the Oz Faces somewhere, and I go by, you know, do the show on stage, and, you know, I used to see all the kids, you know, singing along with the songs, and now, you know, they just know me from the show, you know.  And they're taking, you know, good tickets from people who are my real fans, you know. 
[02:14:00]  I don't know.  I just agree with what you're saying.  I think, Ozzy, I think you're a little overexposed.  I think a lot of people now are almost, you know, I dare say it, getting a little tired of your family.  Oh, you too.  I'm getting tired of myself, you know.  I just want to say, you know, I agree with what you're saying, and I don't know.  I'll always be able to tell my true fans, you know, I genuinely love the guys, you know.  I just want to say that, and I figured I'd chime in, you know. 
[02:14:30]  That's all I got.  And I disagree with overexposed.  Look at this guy, Payback from a Tom's River jersey.  Way to go, Jimmy.  Led Zeppelin, the most overrated band ever.  They stink, and I don't like them.  Right under that.  Norton, you effing moron.  Don't even insinuate that Ozzy and his S-band are even in the same language as Led Zeppelin.  And I'm not knocking Zeppelin through it.  I like them.  I'm saying that.  You just did.  I did not.  You said you're overrated.  I did in comparison with the way the critics saw them compared to Sabbath. 
[02:15:00]  No one said Zeppelin wasn't great.  Zeppelin never made a bad song.  Well, Hot Dog.  Come on.  They were a great band.  Hot Dog.  Other people saying that.  Hot Dog, Blue.  How many of those riffs were more interesting than what I only was writing?  It was all perception.  Wow, Zeppelin is so hip.  I mean, I like Zeppelin.  Zeppelin didn't have interesting riffs.  Of course they did.  Are you insane?  Of course they did.  But why isn't I only with his three missing fingers in the same category?  Led Zeppelin, greatest band of all time.  Absolutely not.  End of story.  Not even better than the Beatles.  Rob from Columbus and Todd from Cleveland both chiming in here. 
[02:15:30]  Hey, Norton, shut the F up.  Ozzy doesn't want Black Sabbath in the Hall of Fame.  Because they kept rejecting him.  He took them off the ballot, stupid in Cleveland.  I know.  Ozzy refused to be accepted into the Hall of Fame, you dope.  Because they kept rejecting them, and Ozzy got tired of it.  Good for Ozzy.  Why shouldn't he get tired of it?  Why wouldn't he just let it ride?  How much overexposure is concerned?  But Seinfeld was on the air for 10 years.  How much overexposure?  Or any of those other guys.  Or Schwarzenegger has been a figure for 20 years.  It's different when you can go on a show like Seinfeld and have writers that write situations 
[02:16:00]  and not just put a camera on Ozzy and his family.  Seinfeld had a little more substance than the Osbournes.  You know, all of a sudden he's at the White House.  I like Seinfeld, but he's at the White House.  Of course there was more substance during the Seinfeld years than the Osbournes.  What do you mean by substance though?  How many seasons are the Osbournes going to be able to take before you want to peel?  I say it dies next season.  It's done.  Of course.  It's done.  Probably.  Yes, probably.  The reason Seinfeld was on the air so long is because of substance, great writing, and  great characters.  No, I don't agree.  The Osbournes are just one-trick ponies, man. 
[02:16:30]  And that's okay.  We had fun with it.  But it's going to die real fast next year.  I think next year it might not be as strong, but so what?  If he'll get two years, they'll get $20 million, which they deserve for all the videos that  MTV didn't show.  Oh, God.  Please, how did I just want you, how did that video not get shown constantly?  Oh, my God.  Even as a non-Ossie fan, you have to look at that video and go, well, it was a well.  Dude, when MTV first started, all you saw was Paranoid.  Paranoid Children of the Grave of Iron Man shot from that 1982 California concert.  I'm just so glad that this man has a passion for something else besides sex. 
[02:17:00]  I know, to see him, sex with Ozzy would be an amazing conversation with Norton.  I respect that probably would.  Sex with Ozzy.  I wouldn't have sex with him because I'm not gay, but I might give him a handy out of respect.  All right, Ozzy.  I'm not gay for Humming Iron Man.  I might actually be up for that, too, Jimmy.  I just want to say another thing is, like, Ben was mentioning before, you know, all the  kids are into, you know, Eminem and all that stuff.  And I think these days, you know, kids are a product of their society.  You see, you know, everybody's into rapping. 
[02:17:30]  And wearing their pants around their ankles, you know, I just think, you know, music like  mine is doomed, you know, because everybody's, you know, turning into rap, you know.  I just think, you know, I don't know, man.  I don't know what to say.  Even hip-hop has to keep changing.  Like, I think they're at a point now.  We were talking about this in the office.  Music itself is at a point where something's got to pop. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, Jim.  It's retarded.  The reality is your hero is becoming a joke.  Not at all.  Yes, he is.  Absolutely not.  Someone wrote on the screen, Ozzy Osbourne is the Muhammad Ali of rock and roll.  Now, people watch the show to goof on Ozzy, yeah.  Muhammad Ali used to be a great, great fighter.  Now, there's something humble about him.  With a quick wit.  And there's something honest about him.  Humble.  There's a non-arrogance in allowing people to see you like that in your natural environment  because we're all a mess at home.  There is an absolute honesty in that.  And that's what people like about the guy.  He's not.  When's the last time Ozzy made a political speech? 
[02:18:30]  Never.  He's not popping hands.  He doesn't matter.  He doesn't try to.  None of them can.  But it doesn't stop them from trying.  None of these douchebags can.  All right, Ozzy.  All right, good.  They all try to sound like geniuses.  Ozzy doesn't care.  Yeah, I used to drink.  Sometimes I still do.  Oh, well.  Good for him.  Tell him the truth.  That's why people like it.  Dumb Americans are finally enjoying someone  with a body like E.T. telling the truth.  All right.  I'll see everybody at OzFest.  I love you, sugar bears.  I'll see you later.  All right.  I think...  Love you, Ozzy.  Love you, Sharon.  I think more so... 
[02:19:00]  I think more so they just like watching him stumble about the house.  That's part of it, sure.  But let him enjoy it.  That's a huge part of it.  Doesn't matter, man.  Doesn't matter.  Good for Ozzy.  Let him laugh all the way.  $20 million for the next season.  See, Ozzy worked out before his tour.  We're laughing at him.  But let's get physical.  We're not laughing with him.  We're laughing at him.  Let's get physical.  That's the reality of it.  That's the reality of it.  Bottom line is he's 50-something years old.  He has done more dope than everybody in this room.  And he is still doing shows.  How can anybody not like that?  How can anybody not respect that?  I can respect that.  I just think it's kind of over. 
[02:19:30]  Please, where's Robert Plant?  Where's any of these guys from the 70s?  Or even sticks from the 80s couldn't make it.  Thank God Robert Plant isn't doing anything.  That's something...  Oh, the Who?  Yeah, they're going to be really energetic on stage.  You know what?  Is he going to show up?  Who was supposed to open for the whole last time?  I guarantee you, though, who is more energetic on stage than Ozzy?  At this age?  You're insane.  All the footage they show of Ozzy on the stage during that Osborne, he's barely moving.  I'll tell you why they have more energy.  Because they haven't done gigs since 1978. 
[02:20:00]  Nobody cares about Quadrophenia.  It's awful.  The Who has been touring off and on.  They never really retired.  Man, nobody likes it.  They had about 10 or 12 farewell tours.  Exactly.  They've never really gone away.  The Who sells out just days on end at major venues.  And you know what?  Bin Laden's very popular in certain parts of the world.  It doesn't mean I enjoy his music.  Oh, my God.  He's comparing the Who and Bin Laden.  The Who is as old as Ozzy, but they definitely move around a lot more.  Well, again, yeah, so what, man?  They stink.  Nobody likes them.  Well, you were talking about energy. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, no.  They've been off for a while.  Nobody cares about them.  Nobody cares about them.  He's an animal.  He's an animal.  There's no one better alive than Ozzy.  A little older now, so what?  He's a maniac.  How do you not love him?  Can he still hit the notes?  No.  That's the beauty of him.  He's not like Britney Spears lip syncing like a dope.  I'm not talking about that, but I'd be able to hit the notes.  I like it.  Why are we talking about Britney Spears?  Because, again, this is how dumb people are.  She's so popular and wonderful, and she can't even sing live.  At least Ozzy just does what he does without hiding it.  That's why I like her.  People watch Britney just to look at the hot body. 
[02:21:00]  Not 18.  16-year-old girls don't.  Most of the public goes and they really think she's terrific.  Gay guys don't, and they love her.  Gay guys don't love Britney?  Yes, they do.  Yes, they do.  Have you read an article that gay guys like Britney Spears?  They like NSYNC.  Whatever they like.  I mean, we don't know what they really like deep down.  Go ahead.  Yeah, she is what they want to be.  Robert Plant, I must say, the worst, the worst live.  The guy could not sing those songs live. 
[02:21:30]  You'd do them in the studio, and you'd hear the albums, and then live, it's saha.  And I'm not even talking about it after he got older.  He had to put his handbag in a vice to hit those notes.  Oh, yeah.  That's why I have a problem with it.  Ozzy plows through it.  He is who he is.  He doesn't hide.  He doesn't try to be pompous and political.  Goal, he's just a rocker, man.  That's why I love him.  He's the greatest.  Of course he is.  He is the greatest.  Of course.  Nothing pompous about him.  Of course.  I'm right, though.  You have no clue that Sharon's using her own husband. 
[02:22:00]  No, she's not.  She made it.  Look, Sharon, are you the brilliance of Sharon Osbourne?  She's kept Ozzy relevant in his 50s.  Maybe Ozzy doesn't want to be relevant anymore.  She's a genius.  To keep Ozzy relevant through glam metal, through everything, after he was in the dumps.  She's taking advantage of her own husband.  Absolutely not.  Of course she is.  Not at all.  She's brilliant, man.  Watch the show again.  Sharon is brilliant.  Half the things Ozzy doesn't even want to do.  Please.  Exactly.  And that's the beauty of her.  No, keep going.  Why is it?  Why?  Why does he have a hit show at 50s?  Why?  Does he need the money that bad? 
[02:22:30]  No, man.  Does anybody?  The Schwarzenegger?  He needs people to watch his show and laugh and ridicule him?  That's not what it's about, man.  That's not what it's about at all.  The whole family.  They're just a regular family.  They're honest.  The nerve of them to be honest in America on TV.  That's what they are.  They're honest.  They're not trying to be cute.  They don't have chiseled chins.  They don't have cute, perfect lines written for them.  Hey, here comes the wacky kid.  Waka, waka.  They're just real people.  He doesn't hate his family.  There's no abuse.  That's just it.  No, they're not.  They're not being real.  They are. 
[02:23:00]  No.  The first couple they were.  But you guys are forgetting this.  Now it's...  They were not...  They were being filmed.  The whole season was probably shot before any of them were shown.  So how can you say that they're watching themselves and becoming caricatures of themselves?  The whole season was probably shot before they were shown.  Well, now that the season has been shown and they've had time.  Yeah, of course they're playing.  That's what I'm talking about.  Where I see it on the talk shows.  They're trying to do situations like you saw in the show on the talk shows live.  Oh, look.  They're fighting again.  Maybe.  No, they're not.  To be honest with you, I don't know.  But again, this is a rock family thrown into this situation. 
[02:23:30]  There's no precedent for it.  How do you handle it?  This is the first time it's being done.  So give the guys a break.  How about live TV back in the 50s?  They did certain things you look back on and go, oh, that was kind of sketchy.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I'm just going because I got to agree with Norton with this whole, you know,  Led Zeppelin's overrated.  I was sick and tired of the stairway to heaven.  But this whole thing with Ozzy, but hey, Norton.  How could they even think I would fall for that?  That was so bad.  That was so bad.  I am theoretically holding hands with Ozzy. 
[02:24:00]  How can you think I would fall for that, sir?  Oh, my God.  I'm not saying Zeppelin's not a great band.  Howie from Buffalo's got a question.  Did you like Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio?  They did.  Look, man, they did the Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules were good albums.  I even liked Live Evil, which would sound like a studio album with hand claps in the back.  He goes, he should be in a basement with little friends with a pentagram on the floor just  talking about Ozzy.  I liked Dio.  Ma!  I'm down here!  No, I liked Dio.  Ma, I'm doing things! 
[02:24:30]  Dio, was actually Dio wanted to...  I feel like I'm watching Spinal Tap.  Yeah.  How do you want a Dio to open for them, uh, a Dio...  Oh, wow.  Fascinating.  But Dio said no.  That's real fascinating.  Well, to a lot of people, it might be.  Yeah.  All right.  Ozzy lasted through everything.  Glam metal, grunge, all that crap, and he's still relevant to his...  Lasted through some of that glam metal stuff with Ozzy with his big hair.  I agree.  He looked like Bette Midler with the painted things and the doves.  I didn't say shot in the dark wasn't an awful video.  I agree.  It was terrible.  Yeah, I didn't...  Yeah.  But good for him to have a commercial here. 
[02:25:00]  So what?  If the dummies in America aren't going to put on Lord of This World or Into the Void or Supernaught,  let them enjoy that.  Look how he rattles them off.  I love this guy.  We've got to take a break, okay?  All right.  All right.  We have a pair of, uh, U.S. Open golf tickets to give up.  Oh!  For tomorrow, though.  So what are we going to do?  That's a tricky cut.  Talkin' to the, uh, show.  Tricky cut there, Maggie.  Very tricky.  We'll try to figure it out.  I love you all.  I love you more than life is so.  You're all f***ing mad.  The current It Boys of FM Talk are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:25:30]  And the talk is racy and raw at times, pushing the limits as far as they can.  Show your hairy pork chop.  My mother smokes crack rocks.  I'm for drunk teens.  What are you kidding?  How about I lay down and give you a little bukkake and relax?  We're going to have a disgusting body-thruin blowout.  G-porn.  Hey, could you soap up your, uh, your bad place?  The sluggier, the better.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS. 
[02:26:00]  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're running out of show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Getting ready to play, what do we learn on the O&A Show today?  Yeah.  Jim Norton losing his mind today.  Really is.  Jim, you've got to agree with this one.  Randy Rhoades?  Yes.  The most overrated guitarist ever.  Ridiculous. 
[02:26:30]  Ever.  That's what that is.  Here's what that is.  That's a shock value statement to Anthony O'Meara.  Because Randy was a classical guitarist.  He was brilliant.  Everybody knows he was great.  He wasn't overrated at all.  Not at all.  When's the last time you heard Randy's work played on stupid classic rock,  sagged classic rock stage that will play too big page until the couch can come on,  but won't play Randy.  That really annoys me.  If he didn't die, he'd be still touring and he'd be like a has-been.  I would have left Ozzy years ago, man.  Randy was a brilliant, brilliant musician.  If he was still alive, he'd be like Tommy Shaw. 
[02:27:00]  And here's another great thing.  Well, no, stop it.  First of all, the only thing they had in common was the mullet.  But at least Randy was a great, brilliant musician.  Randy would have been in the traveling Wilburys.  No, he would have left himself.  Yeah, I think Randy Rhodes would have been a traveling Wilburys.  A Wilburys.  I think that makes a good point there.  They did Diary of Man Man.  Sometimes it's good to die early.  And at the same time they did Diary and Blizzard of Oz, we got Randy on two albums.  We got very, very lucky.  I mean, I'm sad that he's gone, but, you know, I think it might have helped his longevity that he died early.  And as far as Ozzy fans not knowing this stuff until we saw the Oz ones, that's not true at all, man. 
[02:27:30]  If you're an Ozzy fan, you know, I used to have a picture of their wedding picture on my wall when I was growing up.  In 82 when they got married in Hawaii.  MTV did some kind of survey with kids, and 87% of them didn't even know who the Beatles were.  I know.  I agree.  But they're going to know who Black Sabbath is?  Stop.  Because of Ozzy.  But 87% of kids, go ahead, let them put on trench coats and shoot each other, these little dummies.  Who cares what they know?  They're stupid.  But you said 35% of the people that watch the Osbournes know who Black Sabbath was. 
[02:28:00]  I absolutely think they would.  I don't know.  And as far as the Beatles are concerned.  They may know the name because it was mentioned in the show, but I bet you they couldn't name one Black Sabbath song.  And you want to, I didn't say they could, I just said they wouldn't know who Sabbath is.  And you want to talk about Sharon being a manager.  How relevant was McCartney if you let the Beatles band on the run?  Sold a lot of records, man.  Love him or hate him, he had a good run with Wings.  But he was awful in Wings, and everybody knows he was awful in Wings.  He wasn't there.  That was terrible.  That was a giant, giant band.  If you want to make an argument, that stupid song he did with Michael Jackson, then you're on to something. 
[02:28:30]  Oh yeah, Ebony and Ivory.  He had a good run with Wings.  They live side by side on my keyboard, why can't we?  I don't know, maybe because the black keys on the keyboard don't beat up the white keys, stupid.  Say, say, say was Michael Jackson.  That stunk too.  Say, say, say, say.  Oh, and he's dressed like a Mallory boy.  Yeah, but you've lost your argument by saying Wings.  They were terrible.  I haven't lost my argument.  They were awful.  I don't care how much they sold.  Let me tell you something, I'm not, I never, I never, I was never a Wings fan, but they were a respectable band. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, by the critics, of course they were respected.  Guns N' Roses seemed to like a tune enough to recover it.  And they seem more Zeppelin-influenced than Sabbath-influenced.  Guns N' Roses, a phenomenal band.  But I'm saying they saw enough in a Wings tune to cover it.  But still, they covered Knockin' on Heaven's Door, too.  So what?  Sabbath did an evil woman cover on some issues of the first album.  Does that mean it was a great band?  No.  Who cares what people cover?  It doesn't mean anything to me.  Well, you were just saying that most people have covered Sabbath songs. 
[02:29:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You're saying so people know who they are.  I was only saying, you're saying, well, I'm saying all these bands that have covered Sabbath songs on these Sabbath tribute bands.  Randy Rhoades overrated.  So their fans know who they were.  Oh, Randy Rhoades overrated.  Look, you don't believe that.  That has nothing to do.  Can I, can I?  Look, you don't believe that.  Look, he's coming.  You can't pull the sentences.  What?  I got to, real quick, can I mention this?  I got to mention it tomorrow.  I have to mention this.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I'm doing, I'm doing Westbury Music Fair on September 7th.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow at 1230.  That's September.  It's June.  I'm just telling you when they go on sale.  Don't yell at me.  I don't work in the office. 
[02:30:00]  I'm just, my agent called me and I'm reporting it to you.  I wish Sharon was my manager.  He will allow you to plug this show over and over and over again until it sells out.  I just wanted to mention it going on sale tomorrow.  If you admit on our show that Randy Rhoades was overrated.  Absolutely not.  He is not overrated.  He was never overrated.  Who's a better guitarist, Randy Rhoades or Jimmy Page?  To be honest with you, it's a tough question, man, because Randy died when he was 26 years  old.  Oh, my God.  Dude, he was 26.  All right.  All right.  26 to 82.  We'll only use Jimmy Page's material from the first two Led Zeppelin albums.  Who's better?  Ah, that's tough, man.  I'm not going to just automatically say Randy because I love him so much because Page was a great, 
[02:30:30]  great guitarist.  Dude, but no, I mean, it is close.  Randy was a brilliant guitarist.  It's not even close.  Because he didn't, what, what, what?  Because he didn't do the core of the classics that came off?  Jimmy Page, Jimmy Page on those first two albums came up with so many more licks than  Randy Rhoades.  Oh, big deal with his stupid double guitar.  That's the dude from Cheap Trick.  That was later on.  Oh, damn.  We're only talking about the first two albums, my friend.  Is he playing the top one or the bottom one?  He should have been playing Surrender.  If Randy Rhoades was still around, he'd be playing the spinning guitar and the flying Vs and stuff.  Relax. 
[02:31:00]  He was probably a little less Ozzy.  He was playing the flying V when he was alive.  He was playing that, the polka dot flying V. He probably would have left Ozzy in 83 or 84  because he would have moved on and done classical music.  Oh, he wouldn't have.  Yes, he would have.  Ozzy admits that.  Yes, he would have.  No, no, no.  Here it goes.  Look at this.  Bobby from NYC.  Ha ha, Opie, you laughable D.  You worship that no-talent sack of S Kurt Cobain and you have the unmitigated gall to mention  anything negative about Randy Rhoades.  See?  You don't think Cobain's suicide helped his longevity? 
[02:31:30]  Of course it did.  You probably won't even have the balls to read this on the air.  Of course it did.  He'd probably be making some pretty crappy tunes by now.  Without a doubt.  Without a doubt.  But you can't admit it.  And I said, Anthony, sometimes it's good to die, you know.  Right.  What can I admit?  Randy was not overrated.  Randy Rhoades, if he was still around, would be doing some ridiculous thing.  Not at all.  Why?  Without a doubt.  Not necessarily true or not.  Because everyone does. 
[02:32:00]  Name one guy that isn't an embarrassment.  What do you mean?  Just as I was talking before we came back from break.  The Beatles.  You look at John Lennon.  When he died, still hip, cool, New York guy, walking around with his dopey little glasses  and whatnot.  He gets killed.  The other ones live.  Did you see Paul McCartney at his wedding?  He looks like an old woman, first of all, now.  He's not relevant in the least.  And then they're filming him kissing his wife.  And everyone's going, hey, Paul, give her a kiss. 
[02:32:30]  And he goes, okay, but just one.  Kisses over his wrinkled up little lips and goes, if you missed it, that's all you get.  Good for McCartney.  It's like, you don't want to kiss his girl.  He's irrelevant.  He's old.  And it's sad.  Why should he kiss his girl for the media?  He sang yesterday.  You just take your one-legged bride, throw her on the bed, and bang her in the privacy  of your own mansion.  He shouldn't perform for these nobodies.  Hey, give her a kiss.  We can get a picture of you.  When you look at the days where he had the big beard and he's singing Let It Be. 
[02:33:00]  Exactly.  And then you look now.  You're like, oh, gee, Lennon got off easy.  Good for McCartney.  He shouldn't perform for a bunch of dirtbag paparazzi.  Hey, we need to sell this to the son.  Those scumbags, they do nothing but hound you, and he's supposed to kiss his nice wife  because they ask for it?  You would think he would want to.  Who cares?  Maybe he didn't.  Take her home.  Just look at her and go, wow, she really does only have one.  And think about it.  God, good for McCartney.  And his new song was terrible, by the way.  He should kiss her because they invited the press there to take pictures. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  But not to bark out orders.  They give them whatever they want.  Rick, if I invite you to my house, if I invite you to my house, come down, take pictures,  cover this for the press, give me publicity.  Absolutely.  Well, then give us something to press.  But he didn't hire Kubrick to direct it.  He just had people come and take pictures of it and it was happening.  He didn't say, all right, let me know what you want me to do.  Keith Moon died in a rock and roll fashion, man.  Now legendary drummer of all time.  Yeah, Bonham too.  Keith Moon.  Bonham, exactly the same thing.  And then you look at, you know.  Well, the nervous Sabbath to have some temerity to stay alive. 
[02:34:00]  Bill, Tony, Geezer, and Ozzy are all living.  Gee, maybe Bill Ward just put a little weight on him.  He's one of the most underrated drummers ever.  He was not as good as Bonham.  I know that.  Stop it.  Don't even get into that.  Not as good as Neil Peart, not as good as Bonham, but he was underrated.  There's another 50 drummers you can put in front of him.  Who?  Neil Peart, the greatest drummer of all time.  He was a great drummer.  Neil Peart was great, man.  Great.  But who are you putting in front of Bill Ward?  No, John Bonham was right there and Keith Moon was right there.  I would put Keith Moon.  All right, yeah, okay.  Especially for the time, you know.  Also, the drummer from Winger. 
[02:34:30]  And Kaja Gugu's drummer was just phenomenal.  Yeah, he didn't get the respect he deserved.  Or Jeff Leppard.  Maybe Rick Allen should have married McCartney's wife.  And they could have just rolled around and looked at what should be there.  Uncle John.  Stupid puzzles with pieces missing.  Uncle John, what's up?  Sorry, guys.  You know, once again, the show started off really good.  The middle stunk.  And then we end up strong again. 
[02:35:00]  Having a little fun.  All right, what's up, Uncle John?  I just got a one that I learned.  Oh, yeah, again.  I learned if you're walking around downtown, don't look behind any dumpsters.  No doubt.  Hey, Uncle John.  Yo.  Black Sabbath overrated, right?  You know, I got to side with Jim on this one.  Sorry, guys.  Thank you, John.  Thank you, buddy.  You pussy.  He's right.  You pussy.  Look at this one.  No more free tickets for you.  It's an easier thing to do if you're to side with him.  I'll pay my way, but I got to go to Sabbath.  I respect that.  Look at this one.  I love how Norton argues. 
[02:35:30]  He's quick, concise, and makes a point with each statement.  He's passionate.  Norton rocks.  Thank you.  Whoever that works.  There you go.  Maybe I should just put up a lighter and yell, dude, stay away to heaven again.  The critics love that one.  Hey, Black Dog.  What's wrong with Black Dog?  Nothing.  I'm not saying the 800th time you hear it on the same effin' classic rock station.  Could those bags of vomit once?  That's not a Zeppelin problem.  I will agree with you.  They put the material out there, and then it's up to radio to decide which songs they're  going to play.  I'm not saying Zeppelin wasn't even a great band. 
[02:36:00]  Radio stinks.  Oh, yes.  I will agree with you on that.  When's the last time you heard anything off Volume 4 by Sabbath?  Never.  Never.  And you're going to tell me songs?  I'm serious, man.  Well, it's sabotage.  What song should radio be playing from Sabbath?  I really need to hear this.  Hey, National Acrobat on Volume 4 would be off of a Sabbath, buddy, Sabbath.  That's what Sabbath is.  I love it.  It would be very nice to hear.  A national acrobat.  That's the song I walk out to.  Everybody said, dude, that song kicks ass.  Who is it?  Well, maybe it's your classic rock station.  There you go.  Well, they didn't know.  Because it's only one verse.  Your own fans did not know you were walking out to Sabbath. 
[02:36:30]  Because these faggot classic rock stations have never given it the play it deserved.  Hey, put on Dream On again.  We haven't heard that enough.  Hey, do you want to hear maybe a Spiral Architect off of Sabbath, buddy, Sabbath?  No.  People won't just recognize that.  You can't go two for Tuesday or get the Sabbath out, you faggot DJs.  Stick to your playlist, you faggots.  It's the same.  Put on my generation again.  We never get tired of hearing that.  Or how about Brown Eyed Girl, you white trash zeros? 
[02:37:00]  There are plenty of good things off of Quadrophenia that never get played on the radio.  I'm tired of the rock opera.  You don't like both.  You like one or the other.  That conceptual nonsense.  Nobody wants to hear it.  Hey, here's Ozzy with the rock ballet.  Nobody wants to hear that crap.  It's awful.  Did he like Tommy, by the way?  No, I didn't like Tommy.  No.  He barks at, no.  That was a great album.  It really was.  When was it?  71?  It was a good album.  And you heard it enough on the radio. 
[02:37:30]  Enough with these crappy bands on the radio.  Oh, like Black Sabbath plays well today.  Dude, they still do.  Look at I Own Me.  The Who's Tommy plays better today than Black Sabbath.  Because The Who has been doing nothing but sleeping for the last 20 years.  Nobody cared about them.  At least Sabbath.  They tore all the time.  They suck.  Nobody cares about them or stupid Roger Daltrey and his gimmicky tight jeans.  Who's thinking he stole that in Iron Maiden?  Nobody cares about Daltrey and the tight jeans.  If The Who does five nights at Giants Stadium, it will sell out five nights.  You're absolutely right.  It's amazing.  I can't argue. 
[02:38:00]  You're right.  They're a tremendously successful band.  Sabbath never had that type of commercial success and never will.  But the radio never gave them the play.  They just weren't that good.  No, come on.  You can't.  As anybody that knows music, you can't even argue that.  Any band would argue with you.  They had a few good songs.  A few good songs.  That's about it.  Can they stop playing Paranoid or War Pigs?  How about something off of a Sabotage?  You're going to tell me you don't want to hear Hole in the Sky or Symptom of the Universe,  the thrill of it all?  Of course you do.  I love this guy.  If you were talking Star Trek, you would be the biggest Star Trek geek. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, I know the Admiral on the East Coast.  You know everything.  And I don't care about you 18-year-olds.  Like, are you through it enough with Sabotage?  Drop dead.  Is this the sequel to Spinal Tap?  This is the sequel to Spinal Tap.  Listen to all your music now that is stealing from Sabotage anyway.  Those great riffs.  Who steals from Sabotage?  A lot of the bands.  I've heard a lot of so many of their riffs coming out.  All of them, not.  And by the way, I'm talking about overrated Santana.  He does some famous riff that is a rip-off of Rat Salad, I think, off Paranoid.  Uh-huh.  Which riff? 
[02:39:00]  I don't know.  He doesn't even sing his own crappy.  What's that new song he did?  That awful, ocean, stink song?  Smooth.  That's about seven years old.  Yeah, I know.  Critically acclaimed.  I never liked Santana.  You know what?  That was a great song.  Yeah.  It was mediocre.  The song was really good.  Yeah, you listen to it.  Hey, I can pat my feet to that.  It was a good song, man.  And that whole album was amazing.  Overrated.  I didn't think Santana was good.  All the guest musicians and the guest singers.  Exactly, exactly.  We're with Ozzy with the guest singers.  Hey, guys, come on over.  He doesn't need them.  And deuce Randy Roach didn't, you know, wouldn't be able to put out an album singing. 
[02:39:30]  No, and Randy wouldn't try.  That's the beauty of Randy.  Carlos Santana doesn't want to try.  Nobody cares about that dopey fat man.  He's awful.  He was all about playing the guitar.  Yeah, good for him.  Let him do it somewhere in Mexico.  Another guitar is better than Randy Roach, by the way.  No, no, no.  Yes.  He's been around for 70 years.  Yes.  He is the most overrated guitarist ever.  Hey, where's Yingveh in his four years of fame?  Malmsteen.  Anyone with an L and an M in their last name should not be listening to as a rock musician. 
[02:40:00]  Yingveh Malmsteen?  Better than Randy Roach.  No.  Come on.  That's the sweetest fag.  Nobody cares about him.  Santana.  Just awful.  Just awful.  Take the wah-wah bar and stab himself in the eye.  Nobody wants to hear it.  The wah-wah bar.  Carlos Santana.  It's a wah-wah bar.  He's a great guitarist.  A whammy bar or a wah-wah pedal, stupid.  It's all right.  Whatever it is.  Exactly.  That's why I don't know.  Because Randy never used that crap.  He did.  He admitted that he was playing the V guitars. 
[02:40:30]  The flying V.  The whammy bar.  That was a gimmick.  Steve Vai said it in Randy Rhoads.  I'm not as familiar with Steve Vai's work.  The flying V was a gimmick guitar when it first came out.  How do you think he got some of those sounds without a whammy bar?  No, he did.  All that.  Oh, yeah.  Suicide solution.  Yeah.  That's all whammy bar.  Phenomenal.  So what?  At least he didn't try to sing.  All right.  Maybe.  All right.  I'll give you that point.  He used the bar.  A lot better than that fat dummy did.  I'll tell you that much.  That stupid guy stealing from Sabbath. 
[02:41:00]  He stole from Sabbath.  Nobody will ever admit that.  Oh, Norton, you're crazy.  But I'm not crazy.  He took riffs from Sabbath's Paranoid album.  Well, prove it.  We'll prove it on our show.  He's a Jack the Stripper, I think, or a rat salad.  We'll prove it right on the show.  I don't remember the Santana.  You're babbling now.  I'm not babbling.  Then go home and do your research.  Maybe I am babbling.  I apologize.  Is there a point?  You'll find the rift that he ripped off and we'll do it.  I don't remember the Santana song.  Well, someone will help you out.  Email Jim Norton, tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  I'm not going to download and listen to Santana song.  No, but they'll tell you which rift it was, idiot. 
[02:41:30]  They might not know.  Is there going to be a point on this program that we actually get to get Norton and Ozzy in the  same room?  I've met Ozzy, dude.  I've met him twice.  Yeah, but I want to see it.  I wouldn't be this nuts with him if he would freak him out.  I would be quiet and mellow and hang and just stare at him and make him uncomfortable again.  No, I want to get you all revved up so you could spew this off so Ozzy can just look  at you and go, I love him.  No, he wouldn't.  I love this man.  No, he wouldn't say that.  He would think I was an ass.  And who is this maniacal lunatic?  I wouldn't be like this in front of Ozzy because it would make him uncomfortable.  No, I wouldn't. 
[02:42:00]  My own stupidity can wait.  When he leaves, I can make an ass out of myself.  No, I would be mellow out of respect for him. </pre>
