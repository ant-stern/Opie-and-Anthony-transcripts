<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The January 5th, 2009, Opie and Anthony Show opened with a stated intention to broadcast "shit radio," promising raw and explicit content.  The hosts immediately launched into a humorous bit about the difficulty of writing "2010" on checks, followed by a discussion of Ellen DeGeneres seemingly using a joke from their show about 2010 glasses.  They then delved into home remedies for hiccups, segueing into a conversation about *The Pope of Grange Village* and Mickey Rourke.  Their frustration boiled over regarding a $350 monthly fee for their instant feedback system, lamenting a lack of support from their company.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to *Avatar*, with Opie detailing his IMAX experience and a broader conversation about 3D movies, including a comedic comparison of 1930s *Buck Rogers*’s special effects to *Avatar*'s, highlighting technological advancements.

A significant segment focused on sex and sexual practices, including graphic descriptions and discussions of female anatomy and orgasm, and techniques for female ejaculation.  Listeners called in with explicit accounts and opinions, and a pornographic video demonstrating G-spot stimulation was analyzed. The hosts and callers debated its authenticity and effectiveness, alongside a discussion about the smell of male genitals, culminating in a humorous, albeit unsanitary, “smell test.”  News items interjected, including audio from Mayor Menino’s swearing-in speech, Casey Johnson’s death, and a New York City health pamphlet on safer heroin use, all met with mockery and debate. A caller shared an anecdote about using baby powder before oral sex. Sam Roberts provided a backstage report detailing a kiss between Bobo and a homeless man, Mustard, from a recent talent show, with Bobo subsequently identifying as bisexual.

Listener calls dominated another segment, beginning with a caller's story about his heroin-addicted brother's relapse after rehab.  This led to a discussion of interventions and the reality show *Intervention*, including graphic details of an episode featuring a woman who huffed computer duster, alongside discussion of alleged childhood molestation within her family (although unproven).  Further calls detailed personal experiences with addiction and family dysfunction, including accounts of prescription drug abuse and childhood molestation.  The hosts interspersed this with commentary on irritating commercials, such as those for credit reports and the “Slap Chop,” and revisited the disparity between older film special effects (like *Buck Rogers*) and modern films like *Avatar*. Sharon Osbourne briefly called in.  Clips from *Intervention* and *Buck Rogers* were played.

Another segment meandered through a discussion of movies that haven't aged well, focusing on CGI.  *Jaws* and *Jurassic Park* were discussed, along with other 80s and 90s films, and a critique of a Mel Gibson movie trailer was included.  This transitioned into a discussion about an upcoming show featuring Gary Coleman and Gallagher, with speculation about potential antics and chaos.  The hosts, Sam Roberts, and Kenny engaged in a highly informal, sexually suggestive, and crude conversation about one host's girlfriend, including numerous tangents and details about her habits and preferences. This segment included humorous and sexually suggestive discussion regarding a hypothetical "police pat down" in the studio.  The show concluded with a discussion of a study claiming the G-spot doesn't exist, leading to a humorous and sexually explicit debate, a suggestion for a genital-sniffing study by the hosts, a caller identifying the clitoris as the G-spot, and a final discussion of 3D televisions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio.  We've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was where, you know, language was realistic and raw. 
[00:00:30]  Destroy it.  Sexual content is realistic.  And just fucking people reacting with people is realistic.  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I've got a catchy name.  Shit radio.  All right, we hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hole is.  That's funny.  This is shit radio.  And it fucking stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  As soon as he said that, I knew that would just drive you nuts.  Yeah.  Wow.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, everyone.  Hi.  Day two.  Back.  Back.  In the saddle.  Yeah, but we're back.  Tuesday, January 5th, 2009, everyone.  What?  Who wrote that?  Now, I was writing checks yesterday. 
[00:01:30]  Do you write?  Like, today's date is January 5th, 2010.  Do you write 1, 5, 10?  It just doesn't look right.  Yeah, you just write the 10.  You do, right?  Yeah.  The good thing is, if you screw up, and you write the O, like, 09, you go like, oh, oh.  You could always just slip the one in there.  I did that, like, on three checks so far, where it's like, how do you slip the one in there? 
[00:02:00]  You write 1, slash, 5, slash, and then you're getting ready to write 09, you go, oh, and they go, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, okay.  And then the one is very skinny.  All right, I got you.  So you could slip it in to the left of the...  So you realized before you wrote the 9.  Oh, yeah, once you write the 9, you're fucked.  But who's...  You know, you usually realize before that, you go like, oh, oh, oh, oh.  This 2010 is messing up everything.  It's messing up the glasses.  By the way, I didn't see it, but a whole bunch of people tweeted me, Ellen DeGeneres doing our complete... 
[00:02:30]  Stop.  ...2010 glass bit.  Stop it.  Glasses bit.  Stop it.  Like, word for word, basically.  Really?  I'm assuming that she doesn't listen to our show.  I'm not stupid.  Well, perhaps somebody in the organization does and passed along a brilliant observation to her.  People are writing, oh, are you watching Ellen DeGeneres?  I'm like, why would I be watching Ellen DeGeneres?  No, I'm not.  What was she commenting on? 
[00:03:00]  Which ones are easy to eat box with?  Which 2010 glasses give less chafing on women's abdomen while you're fucking lapping box?  Jesus, Ann.  Well, you know, she is a doik.  Fuck, you just gave me the hiccups, too.  The hic...  All right, Ralph, he's got the hiccups.  What do you do?  Drink water real fast?  What do you do?  What do you do?  I usually drink a glass of water through a napkin without ripping the napkin. 
[00:03:30]  It's all about breath control.  I remember that.  I know.  And it does work.  I saw him do it once.  It works.  It works.  And then if you get really good at it, you can do it without the napkin so you don't look silly.  It's all about taking little, little tiny sips, swallowing and breathing in and out through your nose at a very irregular pace to your swallowing.  One swallow, two breaths in through the nose.  One swallow, one big breath out.  One little swallow, half a breath in.  Another swallow, two big inhales. 
[00:04:00]  One exhale, little swallow.  You just got to bust the whole thing up.  No, no.  No.  Do you know why?  It doesn't matter.  You could do it like silly.  I'd rather have hiccups.  Yeah, I know.  I swear it works.  That's shit.  It works.  Let's do a little housekeeping before we move on to some things.  Housekeeping?  Charlie and Philly.  I'm not cleaning shit.  Charlie!  What's up, little boy?  Charlie.  Hey, Charlie.  They took my thumb, Charlie.  Every time.  Yeah, dude. 
[00:04:30]  Of course.  I asked if they give it back, and I said, no, or Charlie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.  Oh, shit.  It's fucking...  We should start the show, Chip.  How about you settle down for a few?  Hey, is the Pope of Grange Village a good movie?  I haven't seen it in so long.  Besides that one line that we all remember from it.  But was, you know...  It was Mickey Rourke's big...  Ben Bugetti.  And Treat Williams, I think, was in that?  Was that the Pope of Grange Village?  Yeah, I get confused with another one. 
[00:05:00]  Treat Williams or no?  Was that Mickey Rourke's big movie that put him on the scene?  I think so.  I think it was.  Was that before nine and a half weeks?  Oh, that's right.  I believe it has to be.  So sexy in front of the refrigerator.  Shut up.  Food.  Food and sex.  Stop it.  I know.  Nicholson did that with Jessica Lange, and the postman always rings twice.  Yeah.  Does he?  It's like the last thing you want is food involved with sex.  Like, it's just did not...  Especially some cream product. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, some kind of creamy...  Now it smells all sour.  It's not sexy.  Just like her pussy.  Yeah.  She just smells sour now.  Just sour.  You smell a little off.  Charlie!  Sorry, Charlie.  What happened?  Sorry, Charlie.  That's good.  He is from Philly.  He is from Philly, though.  They say Charlie down there or something like that.  There's no R, I think, right?  Yeah, something like that.  I mean, whatever.  In Pennsylvania, you got Philly, then you go an hour north, you got all the Dutchies, and 
[00:06:00]  it's just whatever.  It's a hodgepodge of everything.  Hodgepodge?  My main concern is we're still paid for instant feedback, so we can start writing horrible instant  feedback.  I learned yesterday that we have to pay, me and Ant, $350 a month for you guys to insult  us.  Are you fucking insane?  That's ridiculous.  Are you insane?  That's funny.  Gluttons for punishment like that?  For you guys to insult us?  The shit I read on instant feedback, and then I find out yesterday, we have to pay for 
[00:06:30]  listeners to insult us?  Get the fuck out of here.  Holy shit, are you serious?  Three hours?  Yes, I'm serious.  Yeah.  I would bet money that's a mortgage payment for a bunch of our listeners.  $350 a month.  It's a car payment.  It's easily a car payment.  It's a giant fucking cable bill.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't blame you.  I'll sit on hold for an hour next time. 
[00:07:00]  That's okay.  I agree.  I wouldn't pay that fucking bill either.  Well, you know what?  I got my Twitter open.  Anthony checks his Twitter.  Anthony's got his thing over there for feedback.  We got to figure it out.  But $350 a month.  I don't know what the hell's going on because we...  Well, let's just say this.  I don't really know if we're making money anymore.  Because all the stuff that the company would take care of, they don't take care of anymore.  Yeah.  Instant feedback was something Ant and I invented. 
[00:07:30]  It made our show way better.  Way better.  Made the show way better as far as listeners interacting with a radio show.  So, it really was like a James Cameron thing.  State-of-the-art shit.  Oh, state-of-the-art.  You know, before that, all you had was the phone, which was pretty much impossible to  get through on, especially at a music station where we were originally...  The big wood phone that I finally broke.  The big wooden phone.  Or the fax machine with the curled up paper that would just fall on the floor. 
[00:08:00]  The curly cute paper that you'd never read anyway.  Instant feedback was like, look, the listeners can give us feedback instantly.  Yeah.  Uh, it's...  Let's call it instant feedback.  Sure.  And, uh...  Eh, yeah.  And now we pay in order to use it.  I don't get that.  I don't either.  What happened?  The company should be paying for instant feedback.  What do these assholes down the hall do for us?  Like, this...  Day two.  Day two.  No.  Just day two back.  Oh, no. 
[00:08:30]  This is being nice to them.  Trust me.  Oh, okay.  This is just pleasantries.  Pleasantries?  This is pleasantries for the new year.  Pleasantries start with those assholes down the hall?  Oh, trust me.  I could say a lot worse.  Okay.  Uh, at least I'm not pointing them out individually.  That's true.  But what are they really doing for the show?  Because that's the type of thing that enhances our radio show, our channel on Sirius XM.  Why are we paying for something that just helps the product?  It's an investment in the company for them to, you know, foot that bill, uh, because it makes 
[00:09:00]  for a better show.  It makes the more interactive with the audience, which is always better.  But, uh, apparently we have to pay for that.  And everyone's scared shitless of us because that bill just started being slid in with all  my, all the other bills that come in.  That just kind of slides in on, yeah.  And I'm like, what is this?  Like, it's some kind of internet things that I'm like, ah, I'm just signing away.  I saw that too.  I'm just signing away Aunt Nye's money every month.  Oh, I did.  No problem.  Dude, I signed one of those checks. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I was like, oh, okay.  They slipped that in without even telling us what it was.  I want to, I, that's the question today for, for the dummies down the hall.  And I want an answer and Steve, Steve, you go to the guys and go, uh, Opie and Anthony  want to know why I'm one of the dummies down the hall.  I want an answer by the end of the show why we, Opie and Anthony have to pay for instant  feedback.  Yeah.  That is a good, uh, question. 
[00:10:00]  That doesn't make sense.  We have a bunch of engineers around here that do their jobs very well.  They can't figure something out.  And we've never, um, had to pay for it.  Never.  No.  Never.  Just something that was part of the show.  Remember Scott, the engineer over at N.E.W.?  Yes.  I go, we go to Scott, Scott, this is our idea.  And he goes, ooh, interesting.  And he came back with a program and said, here you go.  And then CBS took it and copy, uh, copy wrote the name and.  Yeah.  And technically we're not even allowed to say instant feedback anymore. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even though we invented it.  Hoo hoo.  I heard that on the, the Poughkeepsie station up there in Poughkeepsie.  It's everywhere now.  And it was like, hey, I'm getting a request in on instant feedback.  And I'm driving on.  The fuck is it?  Just came up with that name.  Just remember, before there was Avatar, there was instant feedback.  Yes.  It started it all.  Hoo hoo hoo hoo.  Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.  Tell you hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.  All right, Charlie, thank you.  Later, boy.  All right.  Yeah, but when I found out we have to pay $350 a month to have the listeners insult us everything. 
[00:11:00]  I know, insult us.  What?  That is too much.  Too much fucking perspective.  That's unbelievable.  I mean, I'll allow them to insult us for free, but I'm certainly not going to pay for it, everyone.  Pay?  We fucking...  Psycho Bob.  Sadistic.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, psycho.  Hey, I think we should have a telethon to save instant feedback.  And if you can't get Jerry Lewis, I think it should be hosted by Ted Sheckler. 
[00:11:30]  Punch it out.  You couldn't punch out of that, sir.  No, it was way too late.  I smell the jet fuel.  I smell the burning bodies.  Don't drag Ted into that mess.  No.  Yes.  Speaking of Avatar, I'm amazed I'm the first person from the show to see the movie.  Why would that amaze you?  I'm late to the party, usually, with movies, with the big movies.  But I don't go to the movies anymore.  I will not be seen in a movie theater. 
[00:12:00]  You've got to go to IMAX.  No!  You've got to go to IMAX, get the giant glasses.  Do that metal at home.  3D glasses.  Do that at home.  I wear my funny glasses at home.  Can you do it at home?  I was wondering about this Avatar.  When this thing comes out on DVD, what?  Are they giving you...  3D copy.  Will they?  Yeah.  And then you can watch it on your TV?  Sure.  It's as easy as that?  Yep.  No, really?  Yeah, you just need the glasses, and then they have the little offset version of it. 
[00:12:30]  Well, I wrote that Avatar was simply amazing, and then everyone beats me up.  Oh, wow.  It's like, why are you beating me up?  The movie's made a billion dollars.  It's doing something.  Yeah, something's happening there.  Write me back, like, uh, like it's like a hack movie or something.  It's Avatar, and it's made a billion dollars in three weeks.  I think something is happening where if I write simply amazing, I'm not that far off. 
[00:13:00]  You fucking assholes.  Oh, it's hack, predictable, no way, man.  I hated it.  I'd rather do this.  I'd rather do that.  Like, someone will find anything to be a piece of shit.  I understand that, you know, maybe it's not your cup of tea, but to say that it's just  a hacky movie, and you're just going to push it aside is ridiculous.  Blu-ray disc, associate, Blu-ray, a movie going to be an overwhelming preference with 
[00:13:30]  a 3D, and so it's going to come out on Blu-ray in 3D.  Wow.  Danny, Danny, comment, Danny.  I didn't read the whole thing about it, but apparently, like, there'll be, like, updates  to your current Blu-ray players or whatever that will, and then when they start making  the 3D Blu-rays, like, it'll just be compatible with your player.  Nice.  Yeah, I think it's announced at CES.  But you're going to need a 3D TV.  Ew.  What?  Shut up.  Yeah.  That's the next thing.  It's 3D TVs.  What?  But what about... 
[00:14:00]  Because it's got to alternate between the lines of resolution, I believe.  Isn't that how 3D works?  I don't know.  It's like each one...  I just know you put the glasses on, it looks cool.  I have no idea.  I don't need to know how they do it.  How the fuck it works.  How it's made.  I don't care.  Give me the big, goofy glasses.  I want to see some shit floating in front of my eyes.  I just remember seeing Captain EO in 3D.  Wow.  It scared me.  I saw Friday the 13th, part 3. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, that was part 3D.  In 3D.  Yeah.  Yes.  I remember Jason threw a spear, and I remember...  Eddie?  In one, yeah, he threw a spear at somebody.  What's going on under that mask?  Yeah.  Exactly.  And it was...  I don't remember my thought, but...  They were very obvious 3D effects that they would do, because Jaws 3D was the same thing.  Like, there would just be, for no reason at all, a big fishing pole in your face. 
[00:15:00]  It was funny, because I was just watching a documentary about Friday the 13th, and like  multiple 3D shots in that movie, it was just like a string that was attached to the camera,  and then something going from the string down the line towards the camera.  That was a big 3D shot.  Oh, really?  Like what?  Like they had like a rock or something coming on it?  Yeah, I forget what it was exactly.  They would just pull it towards the camera.  Oh, God damn.  Look at your two kids.  Nice blind couple. 
[00:15:30]  I know.  That's what it looks like.  Looks like we both had fucking cataract surgery.  You look like you're running the Tangiers.  Right.  Look at us.  I'm going to fuck it glasses.  I took pictures of a bunch of people in the theater with their big avatar 3D glasses.  So what, do you get to keep them after or no?  Hell fucking no.  Really?  People with more...  It's like Disney.  Yeah, you got to put them in a big bin when you're done, when you walk out.  Yeah, and then some other person is probably wearing...  Head lice and fucking conjunctivitis puts them on.  They don't wash them after? 
[00:16:00]  Swine flu.  I think why would you take...  There's going to be a glasses washer guy?  No.  But wait.  You just got to take them out of a bin?  They hand them to you.  No one washes them.  I'm positive.  Are you kidding?  They used to have paper ones.  Remember, you guys are good.  It was terrible.  Back in the old days.  And then you'd walk around hassling Marty McFly, still wearing them.  Yes.  It was back in the 50s.  No, they didn't wash them.  It was a simpler time.  No, man.  That was the red and green, or red and blue ones in the old days.  Now they use like a polarizing kind of... 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  They're giant.  ...wings on them.  Yeah.  And they're big.  They look ridiculous.  That's because you need the peripheral more so than you used to.  I'm going to say perif.  Perif.  I was going to say that.  I didn't think anybody, but you would get it, Jim.  Oh, what's the matter?  I feel like I got a toothache on my pin.  Cavity?  I had no idea what you just said.  I said I feel like I got a toothache.  It's been like a dull throb.  It's up in here, too.  It might be...  Oh, you poor boy.  I don't know what it is.  Maybe you got like a popcorn kernel stuck in there. 
[00:17:00]  I hope not.  The worst thing ever.  It's better than a popcorn captain.  No, see?  That's too funny for Chip.  That actually isn't bad.  Exactly.  For a hacky joke.  Chip's very funny.  Chip stinks.  So, Ed, I go to the IMAX for this avatar.  I thought I had a seating for the 3.30 show because I bought my tickets like two days ago  and then realized it was a 3 o'clock show.  Now, what?  Didn't it say it on the ticket?  Yeah, but I checked the ticket as I was going into the theater and it's like 2.40 and I'm 
[00:17:30]  like, fuck.  And sure enough, the line is literally out the theater.  I get the second row in an IMAX theater.  Oh, wow.  So, I'm ready to walk.  Were you craning your neck?  No.  I was ready to walk and I'm like, you know what?  We'll just try it if it sucks that bad.  We'll just leave and we'll just come back another day.  They got that shit figured out where it doesn't matter where you're sitting.  The whole movie looks like it's right in front of your face.  I mean, literally, like a foot in front of your face. 
[00:18:00]  What time did you get there?  When it was 3?  Yeah, I got there at 2.40.  Do not do that.  Okay.  The whole thing's in 3.  The beauty of going to a movie early now is we all have our phones so you can be  Twittering and Facebooking and checking this and that so you don't care you're sitting  in a theater for a half hour, you know, saving your good seat.  Now, the whole thing's in 3-D, so it's not one of these like you sit there and wait for  some stupid effect to happen.  The whole thing.  Something dangling in your face.  Nope.  That was one of the best SNL, not SNL, Second City, actually, skits that John Candy did. 
[00:18:30]  Wow, I don't know.  It was the 3-D theater and he had a pen in his hand and he's like, would you sign the  contract?  And then he just kept, boom, they meant this music and he just kept pushing the pen toward  the camera like three times.  I think this is hysterical.  I think this is the first 3-D movie where they're not like doing that.  They're just showing you a movie in 3-D finally. 
[00:19:00]  Because remember, was it Superman when they tried to redo the Superman series and the first  10 minutes were in 3-D?  Oh, really?  But it was the plane crash and everything was floating in front of your face.  It was so, like, look at our 3-D effects.  I got to see that now on YouTube.  It's Dr. Tong's 3-D House of Slave Chicks.  God, how do you remember that?  That's CTV.  Was Candy funny in that?  Yeah.  You know something?  That was a kind of a, you had to watch it. 
[00:19:30]  It was one of those shows back in the day.  I'm a huge John Candy fan, but I never...  I definitely watch SCTV.  I don't think I remember any of his skits from SCTV.  You know everyone in the show, too.  Like, there's not one person that was on SCTV that you didn't know.  That's Eugene Levy.  Sure.  Wow.  To the left.  Sure.  And then he would just do this.  Like, look at what he's doing.  It's like the 3-D effect.  They just rock back and forth toward the camera. 
[00:20:00]  You know what?  I forgot.  They used to put the dot on saying, you know, now put your glasses on.  There was a dot that made you...  In movies, because, yeah, they would make you put the glasses on just for an effect, and  then you'd take the fucking glasses back off.  Right.  I forgot about that.  In the old day of 3-D movies.  Can Avatar be shown at home, though, in 3-D?  Like, will they be able to pull that off with big TVs and glasses if you have it dark?  Apparently, Travis says now we need 3-D TV, so Travis knows everything. 
[00:20:30]  But you know what?  Well, unless they're going to do it with the red and blue glasses.  Like, they still release movies like that, like the Polar Express and Coraline and all  that.  Those are in 3-D.  What does Avatar look like when you take the glasses off?  Well, it's a little...  Isn't it a double image?  Yeah, it's slightly blurry.  Just show the fucking double image.  Burn the disc to a double image.  And that's all it would do?  And then look at it.  And with the glasses, I assume it would work, but I think they're alternating. 
[00:21:00]  You need a special Blu-ray player for the double image thing, which they're making.  Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.  So you're either going to have to buy a new Blu-ray player, or the PS3 has a software up.  But I'm thinking a Blu-ray player, but then you don't need a new television.  Yeah, you do.  Why?  Because the circuitry is different.  No one's buying a new TV to watch Avatar.  Who's buying a new TV just to watch Avatar?  Well, I'm sure they can.  Can they show it without it being in 3-D?  Yeah, you can go to the theater and watch it without it being in 3-D.  Okay, so that...  You know what?  The movie without the 3-D shit will look great. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  A nice high-def copy of this at home will look great.  It's like when you look at the trailer on TV.  It's not, you know, fucking 3-D.  There you go, right, exactly.  It's what it's going to look like.  I want to see it in three dimensions.  And they're doing something with the 3-D because I get this stupid motion sickness with that 3-D flying shit.  Oh, really?  And I was fine, man.  I was completely fine.  Because it's no shaky cam?  I'm a fucking pussy when it comes to that shit.  Those rides where you're, you know, the Disney rides and... 
[00:22:00]  Like soaring?  Oh, I would love to...  I love soaring.  I would love to enjoy that, but I'd fucking get an upset tummy.  It feels like you're flying and you lift your feet up because it's like, oh my God, I'm  going to hit the trees going over the golf course.  Yeah, it's amazing.  It's...  Oh, it's amazing.  Yeah.  So, but Avatar fucking rocked.  And I was telling the end also this morning, I remember, I'm going to age myself here,  but I remember going to see Star Wars.  My now brother-in-law took me when he was dating my sister. 
[00:22:30]  Jesus Christ.  My uncle Joe took me.  And now they have like a 21-year-old kid.  Holy shit.  How old am I?  Wow.  30?  30.  And I remember thinking, oh my God, Star Wars, they will never make movies better than  this.  And I went to bed last night going, holy shit, Avatar, they're never going to make movies  that look better than this.  And then they figure it out somehow.  You think they're going to be able to...  They have to, right? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, everything gets better.  Because as soon as we stop moving forward, that's when this whole thing ends for everybody.  It's got to be a point where it's just complete immersion in the movie.  How does it get better than Avatar?  And I know I probably said this as a tiny little kid when Star Wars is out.  How does it get better than Star Wars?  But how are they going to make it better than Avatar?  Where you're sitting in the fucking movie.  Where you look around and wherever you're fucking looking, you're in the movie.  That would be cool.  Sometimes there's shit happening behind you. 
[00:23:30]  You've got to see this movie twice because you've got to look over your shoulder at a  certain part.  Yeah.  You know?  And then...  Now you're on to something.  Like, that would be fucked up.  Total immersion in the movie.  That would be something.  Yeah.  That's something I'm working on.  What the fuck am I talking about?  Holograms like that, like where you're living it.  Yeah, they'll have TVs like that.  The holodeck.  Alternate...  You'll be able to affect them eventually.  I bet you're able to affect it.  There'll be three or four different options where movies can go and you can have an effect on them  somehow.  Like the comic book from Big. 
[00:24:00]  I don't remember that.  All right.  Of course I don't.  I just love the part where him and Robert Lozier are dancing on the piano.  Oh, it's one of my favorite...  Ugh.  That's a nice moment.  Right?  Break a hip.  Robert Lozier.  I think...  Is he dead?  Yes, he is.  A banana.  He knows life.  I think James Cameron fucked it up for everybody.  I don't know how these movie makers now go and make some kind of action movie without  this technology.  Well, that's good because Lucas fucked it all up with Star Wars.  He kind of, you know, movies were...  Space movies were... 
[00:24:30]  2001 looked pretty cool.  They got away with it there.  But then after Star Wars, it was like you can't just have some wacky ship on a string.  Yeah, George Lucas and his stupid models, the making of Star Wars.  Well, what we did was we spent 20 years making these models.  Yeah.  And we track it with a camera motion tracking.  And then we add in space and lights and this and shadows and planets and layer it all on  top of each other. 
[00:25:00]  People are like, what happened to the string in the rocket ship?  I started this movie as my sixth grade project.  Yeah.  I'm now 50 years old and I'm about to release it.  And he's been fucking riding it ever since.  No kidding.  I thought...  And I thought like when I first saw The Wrath of Khan.  Yeah.  Wrath of Khan.  I thought that was like, holy shit, look at the Enterprise.  It looks amazing.  And the battle scenes I thought were fantastic.  And then you watch the new Star Trek and you're just like, holy shit. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I'm going to watch that tonight.  It looks unbelievable.  It looks unbelievable.  Now...  Buck Rogers in the 25th century.  That's 1935.  And they did always yell, Buck Rogers in the 25th century.  An interplanetary battle with the Tiger Men of Mars.  Adopted from the great newspaper feature, Buck Rogers.  The Tiger Men from Mars.  Tiger Men from Mars. 
[00:26:00]  What is that?  You know what?  If you lived during that era, I bet you you said it'll never get better than this.  What a queer he looked like.  Dr. Hugh, the greatest scientist and inventor of the 25th century.  What the fuck is that?  This is so bad.  We're watching a little Buck Rogers in the 25th century.  I mean, he's got all kinds of gadgets.  They're just in a room.  Is that a chick?  Yeah.  She looks like America's sweetheart, Mary Pickford. 
[00:26:30]  You can't tell if they're chicks back then.  Yes!  They got everything fucking taped down.  Tragically, her uterus was pulled out by Fatty Arbuckle.  Him and that Don Coke bottle.  Is there actual dialogue?  Oh, this is great.  Hi, Doctor.  Well, hello, Buck, old boy.  Yes, you know, I was telling Wilma about this ship.  How it's going to revolutionize our entire warfare in the interplanetary spaces.  You know, Buck, this ship has a new flash. 
[00:27:00]  He's got a super soaker.  I'd like to try that out in space.  Well, Buck, he's going to work.  Hey, Buck, how was that new magnetic ray?  What happened?  It's a little bit of a...  Wonderful.  It works just fine.  Why, it'll hold an enemy ship fixed and helpless in space.  This is all we're tied to mine.  I only wish all our ships had that ray.  Well, Buck, wait.  Quick, Buck.  The interplanetary code message is coming through.  Doctor, he called it.  Why, Buck, it's from me.  Code in Sydney are mine. 
[00:27:30]  Tiger men love bars attacking Earth.  King Growlowe in command.  X-14-19-C.  Signed.  Buddy Dearing.  Why, Buck, it's from Buddy.  Those rooster tiger men are attacking again.  Now, Buck, they've broken their greetings.  This means the battle of the universe.  Quick, Doctor, signal for action.  Buck, I'll get the signals in immediately.  Holy shit, this is going to be the best thing ever.  Signal to take command of the Eastern Forces.  Signal Commander Langhurst to take command of the Western Forces. 
[00:28:00]  Have both commanders meet me in battle formation on the Jupiter-Uranus rod.  2-4-7-K-B.  Warn all planets in our alliance.  Quick, Wilma, into the rocket ship.  Goodbye, Doctor.  The rocket ship.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  This is where I'm bad.  Can you pause it?  This is what people have to fucking deal with.  You just saw Avatar, dude.  Okay.  You just saw Avatar.  This is where the shit people dealt with. 
[00:28:30]  This is 75 years ago.  But there's no excuse for the terrible story and the terrible acting.  Like, the grass makes it.  Well, no.  He looks like this guy used...  He looks like he did Shakespeare on a stage.  The one guy.  And now he's with these two dummies.  Oh, my.  We'll have to alert the Western Forces.  Like, the acting is horrible.  Oh, Louie Beans.  You want more?  Yes.  Oh, I want a little more.  I want 90 minutes of this.  Oh, another message. 
[00:29:00]  War.  I never expected those fierce tiger men of Mars to attack Earth.  Attacked?  Their ruler, King Gralo, is treacherous.  But I didn't expect him to break that treaty.  No.  But I wonder if Gralo hasn't been influenced by somebody.  Hmm.  I just wonder. 
[00:29:30]  And yet, I wonder if it isn't a trick.  I wonder if Gralo isn't going to turn and attack Venus.  What I must do is to make a cosmo-radial photograph  and get a picture of the war arrow on Mars.  That sound effect is great.  And see where the war arrow points.  This is just like Star Trek, right?  Oh, it's great.  The war arrow points to Earth.  Oh.  It's true.  The tiger men are coming. 
[00:30:00]  It's lucky Buddy Deering found out about this.  For now, we'll be ready to meet them.  For now.  Every gadget makes that smart sound.  Now I am looking to my cosmic radio television.  There are the tiger ships now.  Oh, shit.  Hundreds of them in the...  Look at the effect.  Wow.  Okay.  We got to explain the effect.  This is what I don't know what they look like. 
[00:30:30]  This is just like George Lucas.  Come on in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is amazing.  I can't even describe what it looks like.  It's just a bunch of what looks like Christmas ornaments flying into the camera.  Yeah, what do they do?  They're like rocket ships.  Oldie time rocket ships with fins and points.  And they're multi-color, but it's black and white.  And they're just flying toward the camera on strings.  Do you understand this is a movie with three people in this? 
[00:31:00]  This is how bad this is.  The doctor is doing the worst thing in a film, which is telling you thoughts out loud.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, here's what I must do as opposed to speaking to another actor.  I'll just talk to myself randomly like an asshole, which nobody does.  Well, I wonder.  Do you?  I wonder.  I've never said that.  You don't have to say that.  You just wonder.  Right, exactly.  This is great.  This is like oldie time radio serials we're doing.  Thank God for Brando. 
[00:31:30]  Well, this is answering my question.  Because someday people are going to look back at Avatar and go,  Oh, my God, what a piece of shit.  Look how stupid this looks.  When did they get to the point where they could act?  I don't...  What year was this?  35.  35?  Okay, by 39, like the Wizard of Oz came out.  There's some pretty bad acting in that.  But, I mean, it was...  At least they were kind of getting the hang of...  Gone with the Wind was, what, 39 again? 
[00:32:00]  Well, and I think...  I think what happened was everyone was used to this shit on radio.  Yeah.  So just to see it.  Our show?  Yeah.  Oh, I just heard this shit on radio.  And then it was just to see it.  If you were living back then, it was amazing.  It was amazing.  Wow, I could see this show that I've been listening to on radio for so long.  So it didn't really matter.  Well, boss, I'd like to see me a Flickr show.  Flickr show. 
[00:32:30]  Yes, I knew he was thinking that.  And then the novelty wore off.  And then, to answer your question, then they had to get some real acting going on to keep people's interest.  But at first, it didn't matter because you were just amazed you were seeing pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  You're sitting there seeing, like, moving pictures just freaking out.  Right.  Want to go back to this?  Yeah, let's see what happens.  Here they come back.  Ships now.  Hundreds of them in the fifth radius.  Battlers.  Cruisers.  I must look inside the command ship. 
[00:33:00]  What?  It's King Ralloon Command.  Oh, no.  The mightiest of the Martians.  Ah!  Cruel.  Fine.  All right.  Looks like a cast member from Cats.  I'll penetrate this ship and see who's inside.  It's Killer Kane and Ard Bala.  Those arch traitors.  How could he look into the ships?  I might have known that they'd be back of this attack on Earth.  Ah, there goes Buck.  Ah, Buck's ship.  The Earth battle flees right behind me.  It really is awful. 
[00:33:30]  There's Langhurst.  Powerful ships, those.  Go after them, boys.  Go after them.  Go get them.  Oh, he's farting again.  I'm lining up now.  Why is he explaining it?  This is the battle scene?  Yeah.  There's something wrong here.  I can't even tell.  Where's Buck?  Buck isn't in command.  Oh, no.  I want to hear Buck talk again.  Come on, Buck, talk.  Killer Kane is after Buck.  Another trick of Killer Kane.  The ship, well, yeah, hold on. 
[00:34:00]  The ship, they were having some kind of a dogfight in space,  but it looked like both of the ship's strings got tangled  and they were just spinning around each other  and then one of them blew up with a firecracker.  I guess it was too expensive to have a take-two.  Yeah, yeah, why bother?  Yeah.  Well, you know, the director, did you see the beginning?  The director was one-take McGillicuddy.  That is his name?  What a coincidence.  The guy's tripping over lines.  They're attack-ching.  Attack-ching. 
[00:34:30]  Good enough for a space commander.  Unbelievable.  We aren't using the flash rays.  This is terrible.  It certainly is.  Paralysis ray, Buck.  You've got to get above him, Buck.  You've got to get above him.  Buck, you've got to get in position for that magnetic ray.  It's...  There's a flash ray.  Our men are using it now.  Now we're destroying him. 
[00:35:00]  He's narrating a bad...  ...killer Kane or even now.  ...space battle.  Get above him, Buck.  Come on, Buck.  Get above him, Buck.  The ray is being shot.  There's another tiger ship.  And another.  Our flash rays are working like lightning now.  They destroy everything in their path.  Who said that?  Watch this shit.  Buck's getting his range now.  Get ready with a magnetic ray, Buck.  Get ready with a magnetic ray.  What's this?  The tiger ships are lining up for new battles. 
[00:35:30]  Uh-oh.  Here they come.  Why?  They're recruiting.  They're going back to Mars.  But they couldn't stand the flash ray.  Well, I can't either.  That's sound.  But whenever you hear some old fuck talk about...  It only cost a nickel to go to the movies.  Right, right.  This is why.  Right.  Because it sucked a dick.  Why don't they show Buck and that fucking hose bag in the ship doing something?  In the ship.  Because they have...  They're horrible actors.  That's why.  You know why?  Because this was like what people came to the movie to see. 
[00:36:00]  The fantastic special effects of ships on strings.  See, back then they were doing, like you said, radio acting on television.  Because people didn't know how to act on TV because they just...  They didn't know yet.  Movies.  Yeah, to convey like...  Yeah.  You have a visual medium.  So you don't need this fucking doctor narrating everything you're watching.  But they didn't know that, I guess.  It does explain my brand.  I just wanted to cut all their throats.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he kind of made the break from that stupid acting. 
[00:36:30]  All right, let's...  What's going to happen?  We have to know.  We've got one more minute left in this scene.  Yeah, it's just a minute.  I want to hear Buck Rogers talking.  Oh, please, God.  Come on.  Medic Ray now, Buck.  Fuck with that Ray.  Buck.  That was your time, Buck.  Why don't you use it?  Buck, you're an asshole.  Oh, Buck.  Quick.  Buck, Buck.  Oh, Buck.  Banana.  Banana.  Banana.  What?  Bring pain to earth, Buck. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, he's got an attractive beam.  Now I do need a Buck's rocket ship.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, there's Buck.  Oh, Buck wasn't at a battle.  Captain Buck Rogers calling earth.  Captain Buck Rogers calling earth.  The Tiger men are defeated.  They are in full route and are turned back to Mars.  Have captured Killer Kane and Ardala.  Have them in the grip of the magnetic ray and are bringing them to earth.  XC-497R.  Captain Buck Rogers signing off now. 
[00:37:30]  Captain Buck Rogers signing off.  Holy shit.  The end.  That was it.  You don't have to say the end.  What kid liked Buck Rogers?  How did a kid like Buck Rogers?  Well, they sat and watched that and ate it up.  It was a different time.  People only lived at 32 years old.  You'd go there if you had the typhus.  Right.  You would watch that and just be thrilled because you have the typhus.  Buck, you're standing there with the same cadence as Jim Neighbors, Buck. 
[00:38:00]  Yes.  Let's say hi.  Buck Rogers calling earth.  Ah, two, six, five, B, nine.  Maybe just blurt out some fucking numbers.  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy.  Hey, boys.  Welcome back.  Hey, Matt.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, that thing sounds more like a vibrator than a fart.  That did sound like a vibrator.  Oh, Buck, what a battle I had with that vibrator.  She actually put the back of her hand to her forehead when she said that, too. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, Buck, what a battle.  Well, that's what you paid for now.  That's a very good question from Josh.  Josh, what do you got, buddy?  Hitter, Josh.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Jeremy, one good note.  Do these actors know what to do with their hands while they're acting?  No, because if they did, they would be putting guns in their own mouths.  Or choking each other.  A little lack of acting chops.  Or you'd be hearing this with the script.  Oh, no.  I'm the guy talking and not Buck. 
[00:39:00]  I don't have a script anymore.  Ah, six, B, two, twelve, nine.  Let's go to Chuck in Boston.  Chuck.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, that doctor in the Buck Rogers serial sounds quite a bit like Steve Carlesi.  Did he?  I didn't think he did.  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt in Virginia.  It was a little more interesting, so.  Yes, there's a battle raging.  Yes.  Quick, Buck. 
[00:39:30]  Use your laser ray.  Click on the link, Buck.  Quick, Buck.  Pitch a guest we'll never get.  Yes.  Yes.  Abraham Lincoln is available.  Do you want to talk to him on the intergalactic radio show?  Intergalactic.  Yes.  There's a young go-getter named Adolf Hitler.  He wants to come in.  That's great, Carlesi. 
[00:40:00]  Would you like to talk to President Roosevelt?  Yes, he's available.  I hear he's not doing any radio, though.  But that's all there is.  Yes.  We can get two of the Tiger Men from Mars.  Although they're not in the film.  They're willing to come in and talk about being Tiger Men.  Right.  They're willing to come in and eat actual makeup.  We can't get Buck or the girl, but we can get her hat and two of the Tiger Men. 
[00:40:30]  We can't get Wilma?  Wilma.  Stupid Wilma.  Wilma.  Like, fuck.  It's the 25th century.  No one will be called Wilma.  I hope she ended up as a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard, that Wilma.  Dare to dream.  They all look like Miss Crabtree from The Little Rascals back then.  At the end, the best is Buck is giving his really, really, uh, his just riveting speech  at the end.  This dumb broad is just standing there staring vacantly at the camera. 
[00:41:00]  It's great.  Can we get another episode?  But I just want Buck Rogers.  Yeah, I just want Buck Rogers lines.  Maybe we can work on that down the hall.  Just Buck.  Uh, let's say hi to Matt in Virginia.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Matt.  Bringing everything back to the 3D, uh, movie and TV thing.  Um, DirecTV is going to be launching 50 3D channels by the end of 2010.  And ESPN is going to be the first network.  And they're supposed to come out with it in about the June time frame. 
[00:41:30]  But Travis says we need new televisions.  Yes, uh, Sony and Samsung already make 3D-ready TVs.  You're going to have to wear those stupid glasses.  And there's going to be a AAA or a watch battery input to go ahead and power the things to go ahead and...  Give me the watch?  ...different waves.  You know what?  This is pretty cool.  We've got to start somewhere.  Yeah.  I'll fucking buy a 3D TV.  No problem.  I will, too, just to leave lounging around and...  All right, doctor. 
[00:42:00]  Um...  Oh, no.  And ESPN is launching one of the first networks in 3D, huh?  Yeah.  It's supposed to be the World Cup coverage.  Yeah.  All right.  That's great.  We can watch soccer hooligans coming at us in 3D.  Yeah, who gives a shit about soccer?  Oh, the whole world.  The whole world except us.  Except us.  They might be on to something.  I don't know.  That's all that matters.  It's us.  People are always trying to talk me into the soccer thing. 
[00:42:30]  No, it doesn't work.  No.  It doesn't work.  Why don't we take our first break, Ant?  Okay.  We're taking our first break.  We'll be signing off for a little while.  But don't go anywhere.  The Opie and Anthony Show will be right back.  G3-8-5-6-2-9-8-5-7.  Opie and Anthony, on your radio dial.  On your radio dial. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Study says the G-spot does not exist.  Yeah, right.  What?  Yeah, right.  Who said that?  Every guy.  Yeah, right.  Can't find it.  Ah, good morning.  Steve from Bayshore.  What is this?  He was sleeping in today?  I guess so.  What the fuck, Steve?  Lazy fuck.  I know where the G-spot is.  Yeah? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, really, Chip?  Yeah, it's in a ladies' clothing store.  That's where they go crazy.  I really do not like Chip.  I really do not like Chip.  Ted Sheckler is a bit endearing.  He's got a soft side.  He's kind of naive and innocent in a certain way.  We've warmed up to Uncle Paul, believe it or not.  Uncle Paul is a sick, sick piece of shit. 
[00:44:00]  But, you know, he's what he is.  And Chip, I hate Chip.  Chip's a good man.  He's just very frugal.  Oh, with his jokes.  Yeah, he's got good jokes.  Oh, no.  It's terrible.  Let's find out about the G-spot.  The existence of the so-called G-spot has been debated for years.  Both men and women have felt the pressure to locate this zone of female pleasure.  It's located hidden inside, but you can find it if you look for it. 
[00:44:30]  But now...  What the hell is she?  You could find it if you look for it, darling.  Every morning I say good morning to the river.  Yes.  And hello to that bumpy spot in my vag.  We all have the same reaction.  Ah, shut up, you old hay.  You know what I do to old ladies?  I give it to them in the G-spot.  Let them roll around, coming it over. 
[00:45:00]  Ah, fuck.  I've got to hear her again.  Men and women have felt the pressure to locate this zone of female pleasure.  It's located, it's hidden inside, but you can find it if you look for it.  But now...  If you look for it, like your car keys.  They found Hazel.  Yeah, what is she?  Remember Hazel?  Hazel.  Okay, Mr. B.  That's the voice, right?  She should just not be talking about the G-spot. 
[00:45:30]  But now a British study of more than 1,800 women claims there's no physical evidence that  the sexual hotspot exists.  All right, British.  The study says if a woman claims to have a G-spot, it's only because she thinks she has  one.  We're passing over something, though.  Yeah?  Some guys got some funding to get 1,800 women to come in so they could poke around.  So they could diddle their G-spots.  And then say there isn't one.  No, no, I haven't found one.  Nay.  Nay.  These stupid fucking...  First of all, Brits are known for just, you know, not being very good lovers around 
[00:46:00]  the world.  Sorry.  If you're an English guy out there, whatever.  But you're not known as being the big, you know, lover.  The French, the Italians, things like that.  The French.  Are known for being...  Oh, I'm a home.  I'm a home.  I'm a home.  They're all about the love.  Yeah, I'm more...  The Spanish Spaniard.  They have big hogs, right?  Big unclipped cocks.  You know, they're known.  Just doing all sorts of damage. 
[00:46:30]  Asians, not so much.  Nah.  But, you know, English guys, not very...  Missionary position today, then.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Yes.  So, if they did this study, it's not...  Well, let's do our own study.  Yeah.  What the fuck are we waiting for?  Right?  Oh, no penetration.  That's right.  What happened?  How are we going to find it, then?  Oh.  On the outside.  Yeah.  We'll just make an incision.  We'll look for it.  They'd probably go for that.  You can cut them open. 
[00:47:00]  Just can't stick it in their bed.  Psychosexual therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer was not surprised by the study.  She's interviewed hundreds of gynecologists who say the existence of the G-spot has never been proven.  Some women do have a certain sensitivity inside the vagina that they can pinpoint by saying this is very sensitive.  But we have no evidence that there is such a G-spot.  This is the law.  She's still fucking alive and talking sex, that woman. 
[00:47:30]  She made some kind of deal because she hasn't aged in our lifetime.  She's been ancient for our whole lives.  Dr. Ruth has been around forever and ever.  And that's it.  She's got like the Barbara Bush thing happening.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, look at her.  You start as an old woman and you never age from that point on your entire life.  Oh, look, look at that.  A whole bunch of different images of Dr. Ruth over the years. 
[00:48:00]  And I swear to you, it's the same picture.  Her hair is whiter.  That's about it.  She's taking care of Mr. Jingles.  Who the fuck is fucking that?  I can't stop the Green Mile references today.  Who's fucking that?  She seems to know everything about sex, but she's always been just an old bag.  Yeah, an old Betty.  This is the largest study of its kind.  And while it concludes having a G-spot is subjective, more than 50% of the women surveyed insisted they had one. 
[00:48:30]  Dr. Ruth just doesn't want women to worry about it.  They think they're not normal because they have tried for four months to find that G-spot and can't find it.  Stop worrying about it.  Have good sex.  Have the best relationship you can.  Unless you are Jew.  Fucking accent there.  The J-spot. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, she knows.  Well, where are the broads?  Do you have a G-spot or not?  Call us.  Yeah, we all know, right?  They do.  When you're fiddling around in there.  You do the come hither.  You fiddle around in there.  You fiddle.  You do a little fiddling.  Yeah.  You know.  It's when you're doing the, you know, sometimes.  See, unlike acting, where you don't know what to do with your hands.  When you're fucking in there.  Lapping box. 
[00:49:30]  You know what to do with your fingers.  Yeah, hold your nose.  Is there anything worse than a smelly box?  Oh, my God.  They all have their own unique fragrances.  I'm sure, like balls do, you know.  Yeah.  I'm sure a chick isn't like, wow, every set of balls is like a rose.  You're down there and you're like, I'm supposed to enjoy this?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  When it's a smelly one. 
[00:50:00]  Holy crap.  But it's, you know.  And where's the joy in this right now?  One girl told me my balls smell like a ham and Munster on wheat.  That was left out in the sun.  Is that what you're eating now, Danny?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, come on.  Chicks can't be happy all the time with the fucking what's going on down there.  You got to keep it clean.  But I know there's sometimes, you know, you wake up and decide you're going to go for round 
[00:50:30]  number two or something like that.  And you've been going all night, you haven't moved the covers around a little bit and just  go, whoa.  Yeah.  Whoa.  You know, a little breeze that comes up.  Yeah, you waft it.  Yes, you waft and just go, all right, that's that.  There's been some sex going on.  You know, your balls stink when you pull your scrotum off your leg and it sounds like a fruit  roll up.  Oh, you get slight discoloration on your undies in the crease of your, between your 
[00:51:00]  nutsack and thigh.  You ever punish yourself?  Take your index finger and go right across that crease.  Punish yourself?  What, and give it a good whiff?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy knows.  Yeah.  It's not punishment.  You got to punish yourself.  It's your own.  Yeah, but if it's, if I'm fucking, it's a mix.  You take the index finger.  That's what I'm talking about.  You know.  I like that.  You're fucking.  And you just rub the crease from bottom all the way up and then you take a whiff. 
[00:51:30]  Good, steep sniff.  Yeah.  Want to have E-Rock sniff our balls?  I'd love to.  Everyone go for the crease.  Yeah.  I have fuck balls.  Do you?  Fuck balls.  Let's, let's do this.  Let's, no one shower tomorrow and then E-Rock has to tell us.  Which, which ball bags.  Which got the most pungent.  Smells the worst.  Oh, that's great.  Pungent ball bags.  And all he has to do is smell our index finger.  That's it. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good rub-a-dub-dub.  That's the best idea ever.  We won't go full homo on this one.  I'm just gonna, I'm gonna fucking just jack it and let the jizz pool up in between my thigh  and ball bag.  And just leave it there.  I'm gonna run on the treadmill.  I'm gonna eat bad food and then take the kind of shit.  You know how you just take a shit and it sounds like that Roman stomach and the Tiberius 
[00:52:30]  Caesar opened it with a sword?  It gets the whole area in a mess down there.  Should we ask E-Rock if he wants to do this?  Yeah, let's bring the virus down here.  Yeah, where is he?  Let me say hi to Wanda as E-Rock makes his way down the hall.  Wanda!  Good morning.  What's up, Wanda?  So, yeah, we have a G-spot.  It's called a clitoris.  That's the G-spot.  Well, what about this garbage about inside, an inch and a half in, and then you kind of 
[00:53:00]  do the come hither, like, hey, woo!  Okay, so let me ask you.  What does that do to you?  Let me ask you guys.  Do you think you've ever made a woman come from just vaginal stimulation?  I know I have.  One girl I was with, I'm like, how was it?  She said, I came buckets.  It's true.  It's true.  Thank you for that, Chip.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  What?  Maybe you can't.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:53:30]  I know.  It's all.  You gotta.  From plain, plain old fucking, girls can come.  Yeah, you gotta just angle your shit the right way.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, exactly.  Are you making, are you, as you're fucking them, are you simulating the clitoris?  Is it just, can you just stick your fingers up there and make them come?  I say.  No, I don't think you just stick your fingers in there.  You gotta do some stomping.  Yes.  Yes, some girls.  Yes.  Sure.  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, maybe it's just me. 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  It is just you.  Okay, okay, okay.  I don't know.  Go take your clit and go find somebody.  Yeah, take your fancy clit and beat it.  Yeah.  I don't know if I've ever had a woman come just from using fingers on her.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't think so.  I always use, I mean, I love eating pussy, so my tongue is always busy.  Yeah, why waste it with your fingers?  Don't play with your food.  Mommy always told me, don't play with your food.  Let's go to Danielle in Boston.  Danielle.  Morning, boys.  How are you?  Hi. 
[00:54:30]  You can come from just stimulating the G-spot.  It's very important when you do that not to rub the clit at all, because if you do that,  then you're going to have a clitoral orgasm.  However, there is a procedure that plastic surgeons do, where they go in and inject Restylane,  which is the stuff they put in your face to pump your lips and all that shit.  Oh, yeah.  And they inject your G-spot with it to make it more prominent, so it's easier to stimulate.  Oh, make it a little puffy like the duck lip fucking.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  There you go.  There's a diagram.  Yeah.  The funniest part of the whole thing is when they do that procedure, they have to arouse you.  So the G-spot is more prominent in order for them to inject it.  The Grafenberg spot, as it is called.  It is commonly called the Grafenberg spot.  I like the fact that there's a white leg and a dark brown finger in this diagram.  I'm not too happy about that.  I do like the fact that she's fucking filleted.  She's cut in half.  It's a cross-section.  It's wonderful. 
[00:55:30]  You've got to see the pots.  Look at the fatty pubis.  Look at working the fucking clit with the thumb.  And he's got the two fingers doing the G-spot.  If you're working the clit, then how does it prove that you're doing something with the G-spot?  That's true.  He's just showing what to do.  Yeah, but you shouldn't be touching the clit if he's saying that the G-spot has some action.  And look at the poor anus.  It's just left all alone.  The tailbone behind it?  Yeah.  You'll ruin it if you touch the clit. 
[00:56:00]  You'll ruin the whole thing.  Yeah, you'll ruin it, right?  Why is this guy shoving anything up her anus?  That's what I mean.  He's got two more fingers there.  The asshole's left all alone.  Look how tight it is.  That's a cross-section of some broad...  That's great.  I loved those in school when they showed a cross-section.  It was like, oh, oh, oh.  That was porn.  Oh, it was porno.  I love it.  It was porn.  All right, Daniel.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Have a good day, boys.  Bye.  That was always a good one that you would see in school, too. 
[00:56:30]  Which one?  It's the uterus.  The picture of the uterus fallopian tubes.  It looks like an alien.  Yeah.  The longhorns.  Yeah, it looks like a fucking...  Something that should be hanging on a wall in a hunting lodge.  Yeah.  Right.  A longhorn.  A longhorn ram.  Very good.  Looks like something else, too.  Like a fucking...  What fucking cartoon character?  Help me out. 
[00:57:00]  Vagina man?  Bugs cunty?  Naffy cunty?  Yeah.  Oh, let's see.  We'll get more.  Ron and Bayonne.  Sickle pussy.  Jesus.  Yosemite clams.  Steve from Bayshore.  Pepe Lapelle. 
[00:57:30]  God damn, man.  Nice.  Steve, you're very good.  Let's say hi to Ron and Bayonne.  Ron and Bayonne.  What's happening, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning, Ron.  Hey, I've actually been listening to you guys for quite some time.  First time caller.  And this is quite a touchy subject for me.  I like that one.  Chip liked your joke.  And I've actually been getting into a couple of these videos.  There's actually one where you can stimulate the G-spot and make any woman, every woman, 
[00:58:00]  ejaculate from stimulating that G-spot.  Like you said, like the inch or two, like a circle or two in, then upward, and you just  rub it.  Or you could get even violent if you want with it and make that bitch come like crazy.  Where's this video?  I believe it's called ujizz.com.  Ujizz?  Ujizz?  How do you spell that? 
[00:58:30]  Ujizz.  It's Y-O-U-J-I-Z-Z.  Oh, ujizz.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  It's one of those porn sites you could type in the search bar when you get to the site  how to make a female orgasm or something.  It should be the first thing to come.  The guy explains how to make any woman just come like a crazy animal.  Oh, yeah?  All right, cool.  We're going to check it out.  Thank you, Ron.  Hey, you got it, man.  Let's say hi to Pyrus in Louisiana.  Pyrus.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I always thought that the uterus picture looked a little like the bullwink or a moose. 
[00:59:00]  It kind of does.  Very good.  Alex in Boston, going back to the E-Rock bit.  He has something on that.  Watch me pull a rabbit out of my snatch.  No moon stink.  Alex?  Yeah.  What do you got?  Tomorrow, when E-Rock smells your balls, he has to describe each of them like a fine wine.  Yes.  And I want his eyes closed and his nose up in the air. 
[00:59:30]  Yes.  Nutty, earthy tones.  Yes.  All that good stuff.  Take care, guys.  That's not a bad idea.  We make him smell it again if he doesn't do it right.  You got to really rub.  Oh, yeah.  Right on that.  Get a good rub.  Kind of right on that crease.  Make him smell it.  Face of the ball bag.  He's going to be smelling man balls.  Face of the ball bag.  Why didn't E-Rock come down here?  I don't know.  I won't be here tomorrow.  Oh, no, Jimmy. 
[01:00:00]  Jimmy.  I'm willing to do the ball check today.  Well, Jimmy's in rare form.  So what?  He's still got a big man's balls.  I'll index right now.  You'll index?  You're going to give it a test run?  Oof.  It's only been two hours.  What the fuck happens down there?  Get him down here.  Oof ain't good.  Dan?  What happens in two hours?  I showered.  How are your balls?  What the fuck?  I don't know.  I just farted. 
[01:00:30]  This is fucking disgusting.  It could be better.  It could be better.  You know what?  That's your balls.  I guarantee you that there's another man smelling them.  Work on it.  Get the virus down here.  Mine's still, I don't know.  I'd be happy to participate.  Did someone call me?  Iraq, you want to do this bit.  Have you been listening to the program or working diligently?  I just heard this part.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And Jimmy's going to be on Leno tomorrow, so he's got to fly out today. 
[01:01:00]  So he wants to do his today.  Yeah.  And did you fucking do it or what?  No, I showered.  I should be pretty good.  You'll be surprised what two hours could do.  My ass got his belt on.  That ain't good.  Yeah, this is fine.  All right.  All right.  Let's see.  Really?  I ain't got anything.  How old are we?  You know what?  You know what? 
[01:01:30]  I swear.  It smells like detergent from my underwear.  All right.  Well, Iraq, you got to smell everybody's fingers.  No, I'm out.  It's just you, Jimmy.  I still say you should have a relative comparison to me.  It wasn't...  Oaps balls are soapy, apparently.  And by the way, the fact that Iraq...  We need a control.  Who do you shave with, Iraq?  I'll be the control.  I'll be the control.  It's really not that bad.  Iraq.  Go on there and try it.  Hold on.  You got to bring your microphone, fucking unshaven BC.  A microphone. 
[01:02:00]  Now, now, now, make sure you...  All right.  Give it a sniff.  It's all right.  You're right.  It's...  It's something.  Trust me.  That's the control.  Okay.  It's good.  You shower.  I think mine are a little gamey this morning.  All right.  Get a good one.  You didn't shower this morning.  No.  Oh, he's squatting.  No.  Hold on.  He's squatting.  Hold on.  I got to flip this.  Okay.  I got to flip this.  Hold on.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  I have fuck balls.  So I'm scraping my balls for young Eric to enjoy. 
[01:02:30]  It's early in the morning.  I've yet to shower.  Uh-huh.  Get a good one.  What does it smell like, Eric?  I don't know.  That's not that bad, actually.  Really?  God damn it.  How could you have fuck balls?  I'm very hygienic.  Yeah, but you didn't wash your balls, did you?  That was extremely disappointing.  It was.  Beat it, queer.  Oh, I was hoping for an E-Rock. 
[01:03:00]  I was, too, but I was secretly glad you didn't, because I don't need people on YouTube seeing  my balls and make a guy vomit.  Then what girls will gently suckle them while going, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew.  Exactly.  All right.  Unfortunately.  Oh, I know how we can do it.  The best contest, rubbing the ass cracks.  That's rough.  Come on, guys.  Again, I cleaned up.  E-Rock, would you smell our ass cracks?  No.  That wasn't even a convincing no.  No.  All right.  No. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Well.  If you need a volunteer.  Yes.  Steve runs in with a tent in his trousers.  I hear there's a contest.  I'd like to be a part of it.  Wow.  We lost all the girls that wanted to talk about our G-spots.  Oh, their G-spots, because we had to go there.  I have a callback.  I would say there is, but although, thinking about fucking now, a lot of times you do slam  kind of the, um, get that pubis slamming together. 
[01:04:00]  No, but you never, like.  Sometimes you get some, uh.  You never just did two fingers and had a girl.  No, yeah, yeah.  Well, you know something?  I don't like just working the two fingers.  Honestly, it's a lot of work, but it's, I don't like just working the two fingers, because  there's, uh, another thing there, you know?  It can be done.  It can be done.  Why go half throttle when you could, uh, get your mouth, uh, involved, you know?  Well, a variety.  Or get your other hand involved, where you're just going, like, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.  And then when you're, when you're, uh, having some of that fucking, uh, you slam the, um, 
[01:04:30]  you know, you're slamming your, uh, your pubises together.  Oh, boy, are you?  Then you give her that clitoral stimulation that way.  Oh, we're watching How to Make a Girl Cum.  It's probably a squirt.  Uh, I bet she squirts like a fucking maniac, this chick, right?  Okay, I'm not gonna do, I'm not doing anything fancy inside the woman's vagina.  I'm just going.  Sounds like a serial killer.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[01:05:00]  He's doing the old Ronnie James Dio rock and rock sign.  Yeah.  With two fingers in her, and just really pumping.  Oh, there she goes.  Jesus.  Wow.  She is fucking bucking.  You think that's real?  No.  What?  He goes, oh, so.  That's funny.  He stopped touching her. 
[01:05:30]  She's not just coming in.  It's the training.  This isn't the finger technique.  It's the massaging.  God, she's a fat young pussy.  Look at it.  It's twitching like a horse that just pissed.  That's it.  He had one of those little fucking hand buzzers on his finger.  It's like a machine.  It cycles, and she just has orgasm after orgasm.  There you go.  No, she doesn't.  Now, look at her face.  How many of us are going to try this at home tonight and do it wrong?  I know.  Get somebody to finger my asshole, I'll do it wrong. 
[01:06:00]  Wow, she's twitching like crazy.  Look at that beautiful face.  That is your reward.  Face, fuck that.  Literally.  Okay, now, very important piece.  Drink your Gatorade.  Because she's letting go of a lot of liquid.  Oh, look at that.  See, she's still spasming. 
[01:06:30]  I connected it to this.  It didn't happen.  You don't think so?  No.  Well, what was that squirt?  I'm not saying she didn't squirt, but a lot of women can squirt without coming.  But she's probably one of those very sensitive after-she-comes girls, you know?  They get very twitchy.  I don't believe it.  She just can't.  I wouldn't mind.  Oh, he's going to do it again.  Yeah.  Okay.  I've got a lot of oil here.  All right.  Got his fingers in.  Go again.  He's jerking upwards.  When you're in there, it's going to feel like a balloon is starting to grow and spasm inside her. 
[01:07:00]  That means she's ready to squirt.  That's how I know it's time to remove my fingers.  It's almost like she pushes my fingers out.  Oh, how about that?  So, I hold her here.  Good job.  Good job.  Hold it in as long as you can.  Hold it in as long as you can. 
[01:07:30]  There was better acting in the fucking Buck Rogers movie.  What's wrong with you guys?  She's getting mad.  It's very sexy, but she's not just coming convulsively after he moves his hand.  And no one's touching her pussy and she's writhing around. 
[01:08:00]  You don't think so?  No, I don't.  What would you do if someone's jerking you off and you're about to come and they move their hand?  Would you roll around in spasmic pleasure?  Punch them.  Exactly.  Finish.  And she's apparently fucking, like, Adrienne Barbeau in the fucking Black Lagoon movie.  Ladies and gentlemen, the world's first satisfied woman.  Hold on a minute.  We got Z-Man who said he knows the video that we just watched.  And he's done this at home and it worked. 
[01:08:30]  Let's go to Z-Man in Michigan.  Z-Man.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hi, Z-Man.  What up, Z?  Actually, it's supposed to be G-Man, but cell phones suck.  Okay, G-Man.  Hey, simple thing here.  The video, I think, like Jimmy was saying, maybe she's elaborating a little bit.  It seems to be a little extreme, but I did try it.  I found out, unfortunately, that all that pre-massage shit to make them relax and all that,  unfortunately, that's pretty important to make this thing work. 
[01:09:00]  Now, did your asshole hurt afterwards?  Oh, yeah, a little bit.  You know, a little bit.  Just got to keep it down to a couple fingers.  But I'm not saying a girl can't come that way, but the way he moved his hand is she's  just, you know, coming in pleasure while the man stands there.  It's just a bunch of bunk.  Yeah, I think Jimmy's a little jealous.  I tried moving around a few different ways, and the up and down works a hell of a lot better  than the in and out, but he's right.  You'll feel it start to swell up in there.  But the one thing he didn't really say is when she feels like she's getting ready to go, 
[01:09:30]  she has to push, almost like she's trying to take a piss.  And I don't know if there's something else that he didn't mention, but they have to empty  their bladder first because they get too conscious of pissing all over the bed if they feel like  they got to pee.  So that's two things.  But anyway, I never got it to happen 25 times in a row like he did, but I did get it to happen  twice in a row.  And I'd been to the same girl for 10 years, never had it happen before, tried it, and  she shot about three and a half feet.  I was pretty impressed with it. 
[01:10:00]  Too amazing.  Yeah, I'm not saying you can't squirt cum.  I used to date a squirter, and I would eat her pussy.  And it's very rare, a true squirter, but as she squirted, no fingers inside of her.  Just me licking her clit.  And it would just be like...  What a great experience.  And literally, she would leave on the bed.  Yeah, like a trail.  No, no, no.  Dude, honestly, God, I'm not exaggerating when I tell you.  She would just cum over and over, and she was embarrassed about it at first, but there  would literally be a manhole-sized stain on the fucking bed. 
[01:10:30]  I'm not exaggerating when I tell you.  It was the circumference of a manhole, and it was when I looked at my parents, and it  was the bed my grandmother used to sleep in.  Oh, I love it.  I swear to God.  Oh, no.  All right.  Oh, shit.  But she would cum.  It would just...  I would lick her clit, and I would feel it squirting, like...  On grandma's bed?  On my chin.  Please tell me your mom had to, like, do the laundry.  And clean up the fucking manholes thing.  It was...  We would put towels down. 
[01:11:00]  When I would eat her pussy, we would put towels down.  I am.  And it was very, very sexy.  Your mom is very, very sexy.  Yeah, someone's got to clean those towels.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Have a good day, boys.  Take care.  I loved eating her pussy.  Fuck, man.  And just having her...  It was...  The whole bottom of my face, my neck would be warm and soaked.  It wasn't piss.  Absolutely not piss.  Yeah?  So, yeah, squirting is possible.  Was it viscous, a little viscosity to it?  No, no, no.  It was like a clear liquid, but there was no gross taste to it, no gross texture or feel  to it.  It was very sexy.  Where does it come from?  I don't know.  Like, I know pretty much a lot of all the workings down there. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know where that would come from.  I don't know, but every time she did it, she would just squeeze this, like, little weird,  cool flower on her lapel.  Speaking of thought, you remember when Flower Tucci, I think was her name, she was in studio,  and I think she squirted in Big A's face.  Oh, it was fantastic.  And some of that actually got on my shirt, and I just had to make sure.  And it definitely...  Did you lick it?  Like, Jimmy, it was not piss.  No, it's not piss.  Actually smelled kind of good.  Let's say hi to Nick in Jersey.  Nick?  Hey, guys.  I don't know if this is my generation or not, but we all, in college, we all powder our 
[01:12:00]  balls before we go and stuff like that to keep them fresh, like baby powder.  It could backfire, though.  You could get some cake-age.  Dude, I did that one time when I used to drink.  I was like 16, and this girl down the street used to suck my penis all the time.  And I was drinking and wearing fucking baggy army pants, and I was just, you know, I was  like, I was drunk, it was hot.  My fucking balls were fucking reeking, so I got some fucking baby powder, and I put them  on my balls, because I was drunk, and I knew she was going to suck my dick. 
[01:12:30]  She got it in her mouth for about five seconds, and she went, and she stopped blowing me.  My balls were fucking, that baby powder did nothing.  It was like fucking throwing sawdust on vomit.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Let's go to Josh, the trucker.  Josh.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, to my little experiences I've found a lot of times, you can't hit a woman's G-spot. 
[01:13:00]  They're going to be up on their feet, squatted over you.  You thrust, and they have to lean forward a little bit.  What that does is that pushes it out.  A lot of times, that pressure, like the guy showed his hand on top of the pussy, pushing  down, that puts that G-spot more prominent for the two fingers.  Yeah, everyone's an expert.  And you can't jab yourself a bitch.  Everybody's an expert.  See, here's what you got to do.  You guys don't know what you're talking about.  You take your pointer finger. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  And you jam it in and out of a hole, and you just go, come on, come.  Make a leg for me.  Make it come buckets.  Go ahead, sir.  It's your show.  You talk.  Thank you, fellas.  What did he say?  He goes, thank you.  Thank you, fellas.  Frank in Missouri.  Frank.  Hey, boys.  Love the show.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, man, I was being a fag the other day and watching Dr. Oz, because I had nothing  better to do with my life. 
[01:14:00]  And he was talking about this very, the G-spot in a woman and such, and he was showing a cross-section  diagram, and he was saying that the woman has what is the same as a prostate gland, which  is moved back, and that is where this fluid comes from when they are squirters.  Has the same as a prostate gland.  Where is it?  What is it called?  Well, he had some big, long-ass name, and I ain't smart enough to repeat it.  But it's moved forward.  I'm not doubting that, sir.  Well, yeah, you know, whatever. 
[01:14:30]  I'm not ashamed of it.  It's moved a little back or forward or whatever, but he said that's what, that's what, the same  thing, that's where the fluids come from when a woman squirts.  You know what?  And also, Jimmy.  Yes, sir?  We were talking about the woman coming, my ex-wife, sex was just whatever up until our  second child was born, and then one night we were having sex, and she was on top,  and all of a sudden, she broke loose, and I thought the bitch pissed on me.  You know, I got mad at her, and she kind of got nervous, went to her doctor, and they 
[01:15:00]  said, no, you know, this is not very common, but it does happen.  Enjoy it.  To the doctor?  But she got to a, yeah, her gyno-cologist.  Gyno-cologist.  If she got to the point, Jimmy, I could be licking her or fucking her, and she'd come  over and over and over, but then she could get up and go to the toilet and sit on the  commode to drain out, and she would sit there and fucking cum on the toilet.  It'd be anything I ever say. 
[01:15:30]  She wasn't taking a dump?  She would come, and all these big brown cums would come out.  It was amazing.  Sometimes there was pieces of chewing gum in them, and occasionally a pill or an antihistamine  she'd taken.  Green leaf spinach.  Big brown cums.  It's not going to get funnier than that, though. 
[01:16:00]  For the guys down the hall, Mayor Menino was sworn in.  A lot of people saying he fucked up the swearing-in fucking speech or whatever.  Well, we need that lickety-split.  So if we could find that audio, that would be great.  We love Menino audio.  Yeah.  Let's go to Graham in Pennsylvania.  Graham.  Good evening.  Hi.  Hi, Graham.  Hey, I read something in a magazine about the G-Spot.  They said that there's also another spot, like two-thirds up the vaginal canal called 
[01:16:30]  the A-Spot, and they said if you hit that, it can give a chick multiple orgasms.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Where do you live?  The N-Spot?  Huh?  Jesus.  I hear you.  Never mind, sir.  All right.  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's go to Jimmy James.  First phone call from Jimmy James in the new year.  What's up, JJ?  Happy New Year, fellas.  Anyhow, in that video, when he's finger-popping the girl, it sounds like one of those old crank 
[01:17:00]  cars in an old Warner Brothers cartoon.  Yeah.  The car that goes like...  It's clitty-clitty bang-bang.  Punch it out.  Fuck.  All right.  We'll take more of your phone calls after the break.  It's fucking great.  Hopefully, we'll have the Menino audio after the break if we can find it online.  Before we went on a two-week hiatus, we did that homeless thing. 
[01:17:30]  And a couple things, by the way.  Mustard's version of Creep is being played on Alt Nation now on Sirius XM.  Are you shitting me?  Getting a few spins here and there.  It's nice.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  And Mustard also kissed Bobo.  Remember that?  Who could forget?  I did.  You forgot?  Yeah.  I don't blame you.  Well, Sam went backstage.  Oh, he did.  And talked to Bobo and Mustard about their man-on-man kiss there.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[01:18:00]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  When we last left Opie and Anthony All-Stars Bobo and Homeless Mustard,  they were passionately making out as part of the ONA Homeless Talent Show.  We stayed after and caught up with returning star intern David to get his take on what went down.  David, we just completed the Homeless Talent Show.  One of the big announcements was your massive return to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:18:30]  Yes, it certainly was.  However, I feel like your return was overshadowed by the fact that Bobo made out with a homeless man, Mustard.  I think it was.  Bobo had a pretty big day today.  What did you think of that?  He's disgusting.  I can't believe he did something like that.  You wouldn't make out with Mustard?  I wouldn't make out with Mustard.  I wouldn't make out with any homeless person.  Even for $50?  No, I wouldn't tongue-kiss Mustard for $50.  That guy has millions of diseases, and God knows what would happen to me if I kissed him and exchanged saliva with that man. 
[01:19:00]  That's disgusting that Bobo did a thing like that.  Well, you couldn't end up any worse.  I told Bobo to go see a doctor right away.  Well, hopefully you did.  He's right there.  As Bobo approached, we had to get into the tiny, feeble mind that pulled off this homoerotic stunt.  Bobo, we just completed the homeless talent show, and for your talent, you had your first kiss with Mustard, the homeless man. 
[01:19:30]  That was not my first kiss, but that was the only time I ever did anything gay.  Only time, or only time you remember?  Only time I remember.  Okay.  Now, you kissed very passionately.  Well, I did that because that was for the troops overseas.  What?  That was for everybody listening all over the United States and Canada, and for those troops overseas, 
[01:20:00]  for all those people who are dealing with tragedy this holidays,  for all those people, for all those hardworking men and women that are listening,  that are really bummed out on the holidays,  and they're not sure if they're going to get that big paycheck,  that's for them.  Did you, was there any tongue involved?  Well, that was all part of it. 
[01:20:30]  There was some tongue.  Well, if you're going to make out with Mustard, you might as well, gay or straight,  who can't, who could resist?  That's a good point you make.  So, would you consider yourself gay, bi, or gay for pay?  Bi.  Thanks, Bobo.  The announcement is official.  Bobo is an out-of-the-closet bisexual man.  We here at Backstage applaud the courage and conviction that Bobo displayed in making this announcement. 
[01:21:00]  But we do hope that his next same-sex kiss involves a man who sleeps under a roof.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with O&A.  Nice.  Oh.  Buck Rogers.  We got to get more Buck Rogers audio.  Hopefully, Tom Menino audio from Boston, the mayor. 
[01:21:30]  His fifth term, and he fucked it all up as he was swearing in, I hear.  Anthony Abroad died overnight.  Abroad.  Casey Johnson, daughter of Jets owner and girlfriend of Tia Tequila.  Is that how you say her name?  Yeah.  What?  Found dead at age 30.  It's Woody Johnson's daughter, basically, the owner of the Jets.  And Johnson, as in Johnson and Johnson. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, this is a socialite.  An heiress.  An heiress, dead at 30.  Man, she was in some kind of a crazy relationship with the heiress from some other girl.  They had, like, a really volatile public relationship.  Somebody else might know, but some other girl who's...  Tila.  No, no, no.  Before her, her ex, it was a very, very...  Like, the one girl tried to set her hair on fire.  Jesus.  It was a very volatile public relationship.  Wow.  I cannot remember who the family of the other girl is from.  And what did she die of? 
[01:22:30]  They think it might have been diabetes or a pill overdose.  They don't know.  But they said she might have been dead for a couple days.  Jim, it was the Yahoo heiress, I think.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  It's a girl...  Thank you.  It was the daughter of the Yahoo chairman or founder.  Travis knows everything.  To me, it just sounds like a couple of...  Like these rich kid heiresses running amok.  Right, of course.  Let me eat box kind of a thing.  Or just misbehaving and, you know...  I mean, it happens to fucking broke kids, too.  I just hope it doesn't affect the Jets' playoff hopes this Sunday. 
[01:23:00]  Probably help them.  Help them.  There's something to go for.  Let's do it for the boss.  Let's do it for the boss.  As he buries his daughter.  Oof.  Win for...  Win for Casey.  What do you got there, E-Rock?  Benino.  You got the Benino?  Is it good?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh!  Love the Benino.  All right, fuck it.  We're going to do a little news here.  We'll continue with the other stories in a little bit.  Man, Benino.  Yeah, you're right.  It is.  Benino, sworn in for the fifth time.  Wow. 
[01:23:30]  And he was first elected.  You want to guess?  What year?  It had to be like right before we got there, right?  Right?  We got to Boston in 95, and he was already in office two years.  Oh, five?  Two years he was already.  He got elected the first time in 93.  We left Boston 12 years ago, and he's still the mayor.  Saw an automobile once.  Yeah, he's been there for a while. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know what it is with Massachusetts, man.  They just don't like letting their politicians go.  What I don't understand is that he's a horrendous public speaker, and he's a politician, and he continues to be re-elected.  And they now openly laugh at him at press conferences and stuff when he tries to talk, and he's their mayor.  July 12, 1993, Menino took office.  Yeah.  Fuck.  That's a long, long time ago.  To be a mayor, that, yeah, no term limits there. 
[01:24:30]  I was doing the nighttime attitude in 93.  All right.  Boo, boo, boo.  Here's Menino swearing in as mayor.  Goes okay.  So the first clip, he goes okay.  Gets worse from here, though.  I.  I, Thomas Menino.  Do solemnly swear.  Do solemnly swear.  That I will.  Salami swear.  He's swearing about salami, I think.  Do salami swear.

[01:31:00]  of what  of  heroin  what  yes  uh  a lot of taxpayer dollars  how much  how much money  32,000  no that's not that much  but it's taxpayer money  motherfuckers  uh it  it was uh used  so  people could get these pamphlets  and uh  learn  how to  do heroin  holy shit  preventing an overdose  tip number one 
[01:31:30]  um  i guess they're assuming  that the money we save  on medical  mishaps  if this is used  will outweigh  32,000  how to treat overdose  i don't see a lot of heroin addicts  reading this pamphlet though  well that's the problem  don't share  yeah you're a heroin addict  and the only way to get your fix  is to share a needle  i think you're sharing a needle  that's the problem  you're not  you're addicted  you're not gonna sit there  and go  well i'm not sharing that needle  and the fact that you're a heroin addict 
[01:32:00]  you're not reading this shit  right  this is put out for  for who  use new uh syringes  why do we have copies  uh prepare drugs carefully  wash your hands  yeah the heroin addict  wash your hands  go out of his way  to wash his hands  before he uh shoots up  take care of your veins  these are all the tips  uh yeah  don't dig for veins  uh opie  if you don't register  pull out and try again  and don't always inject  the same spot  only boot  once or twice 
[01:32:30]  in one shot  what  this is unbelievable  uh  know your hiv status  uh oh  get tested and treated  for hep  get help for depression  what  ask for help  uh to stop using  oh i see a problem  what  illustration  which illustration  the one on tip number seven  uh white guys  uh black  uh woman  where  on the know your hiv status  uh huh  it's a black woman  right there  that's gonna uh 
[01:33:00]  cause some problems  i'm sure  some organization  will call up  and say that's uh  inappropriate and stereotyping  and we shouldn't do that  just saying  well they should use  should be a white man  no they should use  the blue people  from avatar  are they gonna be  keep it safe  they'll be the ones  that kick in the door  at uh  yeah  keep it safe  commercials and everything  yeah  that'd be good  no one will complain  they might complain though  cause she looks like  one of jj evans's paintings  here's the story on this  nobody condones 
[01:33:30]  drug use  but if you're going  to use it  it certainly is not  in anybody's interest  in society  to have you  get hiv aids  mayor bloomberg  today defending  the city health department's  flyer  take charge  take care  critics calling it  a how to manual  for drug users  it sends out the wrong message  it sends out a message  that using heroin  can be safe  the handout on which  the city spent  32,000 taxpayer dollars  offers 10 tips  for safer use  of intravenous drugs 
[01:34:00]  going as far as  to describe  how to prepare  drugs carefully  like use  fresh tap water  or sterile water tubes  use a new cooker  every time  don't touch the inside  and drop the cotton  directly onto the cooker  i have no idea  what they're even  talking about  drop the cotton  directly on the cooker  is that like  filter it  that sounds like  more g-spot talk  yeah i have no idea  what the fuck  that even means  let's say  hi to ken in jersey  ken  yeah how about 
[01:34:30]  how about the number  one tip being  don't friggin do it  yeah they should  start with that  right  it's unbelievable  32,000  and they're  actually thinking  these drug users  are going to read  this thing  no one's good  no drug user  is going to  read this shit  unreal  most of our politicians  are completely  out of touch  with what's really  going on  yeah they're idiots  no heroin user  is going to  read this  hell fucking  no  it doesn't  worry 
[01:35:00]  it's like  it's like  when they try  to round  the homeless  up and like  count them  make them do  things  that they don't  want to do  because they're  they're crazy  they're not  going to do  this  all right  we should really  read through a lot  of this  tip one  prevent overdose  just imagine  you're a heroin  addict okay  right let me lay  down on the floor  use  use  it's the first tip  use with someone else  are you thinking  this shit  if you're addicted  yeah you have  let's say you have 
[01:35:30]  your heroin  right  and your works  right  so I know the lingo  your works  and uh  you're gonna sit there  and go  I can't do this  I gotta call up  somebody before I do  my hair on  hey what's up  uh what are you doing  got some heroin  maybe you wanna come over  right  no shit  can't do it yet  right  you have that needle  in your arm so fast  stop it  such bullshit  if you're not  if you're alone  and something goes  wrong no one  could help you  know your tolerance  yeah cause that's  what heroin addicts  do  yeah yeah  they know their 
[01:36:00]  tolerance  look at jimmy  jimmy's been in  this world  not the heroin  world  right  but you've been  in this addiction  addiction world  yes  how ridiculous  is this  it's a little silly  I don't mind  them doing it  like  eventually  maybe it will  help  and there's  enough messages  about alcohol  if it helps  one person  right  no  if it helps  over $32,000  worth of fucking  yeah exactly  I'm not a fan  of the  if it helps  just one person  yeah it's not  worth it  it's really not  no this is stupid  so you gotta know  your tolerance  use less than usual  yeah okay 
[01:36:30]  yeah that's  not right  look  look I never did  heroin but I  certainly did a  little coke in the  day  a little coke  imagine this  for cocaine  let's  yeah yeah  cause we could  more of us  can relate to  cocaine  so when you  have your coke  what you do is  use less than  usual  yeah just do a  couple of lines  and then take  the rest of your  coke and then  put it away for  the whole night  and then you'll  have some for  tomorrow  instead of you  know doing it  all that second  you know if  Bloomberg was a 
[01:37:00]  good mayor  he would have  done the heroin  so then he  understands what's  going on out  there and then  he could really  write this shit  out  no  just imagine  using a little  a little less  Anthony  yeah a little less  don't mix drugs  okay  combining heroin  or painkillers  with benzos  alcohol or cocaine  increases overdose  risk  okay  that's it  so you're not  gonna you know  you're not gonna  have a few beers  or have a 40  or something  right  well you do it  yeah this is  this is useless 
[01:37:30]  they're gonna read  this pamphlet and  say forget the  beer let's get  some five alive  or some sunny  D  right  let's go to  Joe in Queens  wow the phones are  certainly lit on this  topic let's say  hi to Joe  Joe what do you  got buddy  yeah I'm not  calling anybody  over to help  boot up  that means I gotta  share with some  useless prick  I want it all  for myself  yeah exactly  you think  you think your  heroin buddy is  gonna come over  and not do  your heroin  right  again let's go 
[01:38:00]  to the coke thing  yeah  would you rather  do coke  and not give it  to anybody else  so you have  more coke  the only reason  you talk to  other assholes  when you're doing  coke is because  they have the coke  right  he wasn't helping  me mom that old  lady  see ya boys  alright let's  say hi to Greg  in Philly  he's an ex  he used to do  the hair ride  what's up Greg  what are you  every name  hello  hey Greg  no we have  the same kind  of thing up  in Philly  but along  with the pamphlet 
[01:38:30]  they give you  clean needles  and clean water  and bleach  to clean the needles  so  yeah they did  that in like  Seattle too  the needle program  I mean a lot  of cities have  done that  I understand  where that could  be helpful  because if you're  going to do it  you might as well  hand them  you know  clean needles  but a lot of  people were against  the needle program  and they were like  ah it's encouraging  which it wasn't  right  well I had that  age right now  if it wasn't for that  so  it helped you right  definitely did  helped me get clean 
[01:39:00]  right on man  congrats Greg  see ya man  alright let's go to  Jeremy in Cleveland  Jeremy you're back  yeah I have to work  with drug treatment  and the cotton is  the filter  the cooker is  the spoon that's  being you know  cooked by the lighter  right  and yeah my girl  sister is like  struggling with it  right now  and it really is  a bitch to get  off like coke's  probably a lot  easier to get  off than heroin  you think  I would imagine  what is she doing  horse  what  yeah  I said is she  doing horse

[01:44:30]  about the  risks and the  dangers  and what not  and he had  people supporting  him and everything  and he just  continued doing  it even though  he knew  that he was  probably going  to ultimately  kill him  he still just  kept doing it  and doing it  and doing it  I don't think  there's any  pamphlet in the  world  that could have  stopped him  so I really  this is  embarrassing  it really  is embarrassing  this pamphlet  this reminds me  of the propaganda  for like  pot years ago 
[01:45:00]  like reefer  madness  and shit  like that  it's like  they think  it's the  government  stepping in  thinking they  know what's  best  and it's  so out of  touch  it's so  out of  touch  is what  it comes  down to  I mean  they mean  well  but they're  clueless  I mean  because tip  two  thank you  Brian  that's kind  of the point  we're making  what Brian  just made  tip two  a lot of  shit  but did  you know  there's an  OD rescue  kit  oh yeah  how many  heroin addicts  are walking  around with  an OD rescue  kit  that's handy  use the 
[01:45:30]  Narcan in  your OD  rescue kit  it works  for up to  two hours  a narc  Narcan  or something  like that  N-A-R-C-A-N  I was scared  I don't know  what that is  and then  tip three  is all about  don't sharing  and  yeah  who doesn't  who the fuck  doesn't know  that if you  share a needle  you might get it  exactly  but how do  they know it  because that  stupid message  has been gotten  out so many  times  but it's  it got out  through just  everyone knows  it  and said it 
[01:46:00]  I don't think  it was pamphlets  or anything  oh Anthony  pamphlets  are everything  pamphlets  I hate a pamphlet  I feel like  I'm really defending  this but I'm not  I just don't think  it's awful  let's go to  Ronnie in Florida  Ronnie  good morning  Jimmy  hi Ron  it's simple  if you're  fucking doing  heroin  you're simply  not interested  in being safe  or doing anything  safe  who the fuck  is going to  wash their hands  before they go  fucking get high  you're interested 
[01:46:30]  in getting high  and being safe  dude that's not  necessarily true  because you  do you remember  when Jody Sweet  was in here  or was it  Scott Weiland's  wife  who said  that she had  a whole system  yeah but she's  got OCD  exception to the  rule  she was a  neat freak  to begin with  I don't think  most of the  heroin people  out there  are neat  no no no  but I mean  people do  these things  I'm sure  there's a small  percentage that  go ahead  to keep  themselves  go  it's like  even though 
[01:47:00]  a lot of times  these safe  fail safes  don't work  people do  these things  to try  a lot of guys  won't share  needles now  because they  know it's  going to give  them AIDS  if people  didn't give  a shit  they would  just be  sharing needles  so it's like  people do  try on some  level to keep  necessary  that was  nice  I was looking  at one of  the movie  things  it's called  The Devil's  Harvest  oh no  a fifth  column  showing  destruction  in the youth  of America  Devil's Harvest  a good girl 
[01:47:30]  until she  lights a  reefer  the truth  about marijuana  the smoke  of hell  and they  have a picture  there of  some guy  lighting a  reefer  for a chick  and she  is just  ready to  fucking  suck  his dick  I bet  her dress  is hiked  up  I think  the best  part about  this particular  poster  is that  she's actually  smoking the  joint out of  one of those  cigarette holders  old school  cigarette holder  she's a classy  girl  until she  lights a reefer 
[01:48:00]  I like the  other poster  for Devil's  Harvest  because it  says a  vicious racket  with its arms  around your  children  it's like  this devil  man  kind of  holding a  woman  and it's  so very  obviously  a white  woman smoking  a joint  and it's  so very  obviously  trying to  be like  a black  guy  a negro  let's say  that  what's your  last name  in social  yeah right  yeah right  I just want  to make a  point that  the $32,000  that this  program  cost 
[01:48:30]  if you  save like  two or  three people  from medical  expenses  or whatever  you've paid  for it  right there  oh yeah  we're not  talking a lot  of people  so they're  lowering  in order to  pay for this  okay so  they'll lower  my taxes  then right  because it's  saving people  is that what's  going to happen  now  I mean  if it's  a plan  that ends  up paying  for it  then yeah  no it  won't  well  this is  a feel  good thing  well and  and then  that say  I wonder 
[01:49:00]  if this is  not necessarily  for actual  heroin users  but for  families of  heroin users  people who  haven't heard  this message  yet  you know  I got it  when I was  in high  school  you got it  when you  were in  high school  but you  know there  are people  who maybe  haven't heard  it yet  because it's  I don't  know  they're young  or maybe  they're too  old  they haven't  heard it  yet  so  there's  nothing in  the pamphlet  that talks  about signs  but maybe  if you see  you know  your kids  have got  you know 
[01:49:30]  describing  what works  are  when did  you lose  him  oh  that's a  very good  point  when did  you  not out  when did  you phase  out  because I  know  when I  did  I just  want to  see if  it's  about  the  same  time  is it  like  I  faded  out  so bad  I don't  even  remember  what his  name was  I know  I know  I just  really  just  nodded  off  there  where did  you  fade out  I don't  remember  I just  noticed  I was  staring  you know  that blank  stare  you're not 
[01:50:00]  even looking  at anything  I was staring  and I just  went like  holy shit  a listener is  just babbling  on the show  no it's sad  I just assumed  you would take  care of the rest  of this phone call  no no  I was gone  so was I  Jimmy  this guy  there are  times on  the show  like I  just assume  I will  take care  of this  I'll take  my twitter  or something  but we  both bailed  you  you didn't  interest  one person  in this  room  with your  story  alright  the guy 
[01:50:30]  he's just  trying  I know  he's just  trying  but you  know  help  so  why is  he suggesting  I don't  know  ok  what's next  I'll go  home and  get your  fucking  shine box  this guy  is going  to tell  us how  the rescue  kit  works  nope  he's  gone  we got  a lot  of phone  calls  Christian  what do  you got  buddy  hey 
[01:51:00]  my brother  is a  recurring  heroin addict  and let  me tell  you  that pamphlet  the only  use that  pamphlet  has  is actually  holding your  heroin  so you don't  lose it in  your fucking  pocket  there you  go  you can  wrap up  a lot  of horse  a lot  of H  with that  yeah  disco  biscuits  I can tell  you right  now that  that pamphlet  is useless  because my  brother  we sent  him to  a $20,000  rehab  put my  family in  financial  distress  he came  out  the day  he got 
[01:51:30]  out  he had  a fucking  party  with us  and they  went out  and shot  a needle  on his arm  and we got  a call from  his girlfriend  that he was  fucking dying  or some shit  like that  20 G's  down the  shitter  you know  speaking of  which I was  watching  intervention  last night  yeah  for anybody  for anybody  that's in  my inner  circle  don't  ever  invite me  to an  intervention  I'm not  going  and I'm  not pouring  my soul  out to  you  I'm doing  none of  that  you gotta  write it  down on  the paper  and then  read it  right  and you  missed the  birth  of my 
[01:52:00]  son  he doesn't  even know  his uncle  oh I hate  don't invite  me to that  horse shit  right  shut up  hold on  we were  watching last  night  and I said  to my girl  I'm like  can't these  people talk  from the heart  yeah  why does it  have to be  written down  you have to  write it down  and  we have to  give you an  ultimatum  right  unless you  go to this  rehab  you're never 
[01:52:30]  gonna see  me again  right  or my  little daughter  your niece  there were  times I like  to remember  what you were  like before  the drugs  you were  productive  and fun  I think  back at the  time we used  to go camping  and fishing  and now all  I can think  about is the  harm you're  doing to  your family  shut up  I will never 
[01:53:00]  be one of  those people  in a fucking  horrible  Sheridan  hotel room  open that  door up  surprise  asshole  I fucking  am not  gonna cater  to that  bullshit  ever  I made  a mistake  catering  to it  too long  and it  wasn't a  drug thing  no interventions  catering to  that horse  shit  not now  not never  would you go  to an  intervention  for somebody 
[01:53:30]  sorry  it would depend  on the person  it would depend  on my  relationship  to them  and if I  thought it  would help  them  you do it  just like a  roast  that'd be  fun  just roast  them  but the  comedians  at an  intervention  so I see  that your  grandmother  showed up  that would  kind of  be funny  and then  the  intervention  with just  comics  doing a  fucking  complete  that would  be great  that's a  very funny  one  and then  the person  runs out  and then  someone is  selected to  run it  no  go get him 
[01:54:00]  go get him  bring him  back  okay look  I'm gonna  go to the  rehab  thank god  thank god  cut to the  end where  you put the  print of  what happened  to him  later  right  he's back  on drugs  and everything's  fucked up  I think last  night she's  currently in  California still  doing heroin  yeah  still doing  heroin  I had to  take a day  off from  work for  your stupid  intervention  thanks 
[01:54:30]  to use a  three day  weekend to do  something fun  but no  thank you  you watch  the show  though  not a lot  hoarders  not a lot  but I do  take a peek  I've never  seen intervention  I've never  watched it  it's funny  to watch  it's hilarious  you know why  I have no  vested interest  in these people  so I could  give a flying  fuck  the one that  was the  fucking  the dust  girl  that we've  walking on  sunshine girl  is by far  the best  intervention  although the 
[01:55:00]  naked  the hot  naked  chick  where they  would open  the front  door of  like a  shitty  apartment  and slide  food in  because they  were scared  shitless of her  and she was  just naked  she would  just destroy  her room  over and  over  and she  had a sister  that was  coddling her  and cleaning  up her house  after she  destroyed it  that one's  pretty good  yeah a lot  of times  there's some  family member  who is just  a fucking  completely  codependent  slob  sorry Jimmy  oh what  what is she  this is the best  intervention ever  it's like 
[01:55:30]  i'm walking  on sunshine  she does  them  almost 24  hours a day  oh my god  i'm afraid i'm  gonna be one of  six at her  funeral  carrying the  coffin  what is she  huffing  she's  huffing  that  computer  fucking  air  shit  holy  shit  look at the  cops  are  pinning her  i don't care  if i sacrifice  the life  of anybody  else  i need it  now  fuck you  she doesn't  know she'll 
[01:56:00]  face an  hi allison  you've got  to be kidding  me  i'm sick  and tired  of chasing  you around  and we're  right away  from you  that's me  right there  i would not  i mean i  wouldn't be  that sister  you haven't  seen the  allison story  yet  i love it  we did the  audio years  ago  it's the  best intervention  ever  yeah  it is  terrific  she huffs 
[01:56:30]  the fucking  stuff that you  clean your  keyboard with  i have to  check on my  sister  why is that  just hair  clean up  how you doing  i'm glad you're  eating  see you later  i love you  ali  her inside  her spirit 
[01:57:00]  her being  i know it's  in there  yeah  it hasn't  shown itself  in a long  time  maybe she's  just trying to  clean it out  with the  keyboard cleaner  it's hurt  and pain  she's trying to  blow some  uncle's semen  back out  through her  anus  look at this  fucking  there she is  she's got a  big  wow  inhalants are  breathable chemical  vapors that produce  mind altering effects 
[01:57:30]  disney slurred speech and  lack of coordination  yay  the inhalant that  allison uses is a  duster cleaner for  computers  jesus  the chemical content  is called toluene  avoid skin contact  with freezing liquid  avoid inhalation  keep out of reach  your children  she does them  almost 24 hours a day  the only time she  isn't doing it  is when she's out  buying more duster  we are going on a 
[01:58:00]  drug run  hooray  best part of my day  hooray  drug run  she just goes to like  this part always makes me so nervous  i feel like everybody knows  exactly what i'm doing  when i go in  they're gonna now  dummy  and there she goes  why do they sell this shit  ten cans of computer  how does she get the money for this  i think her mother gives it  to her  to enable her  there you go  that's good mom  she's buying uh 
[01:58:30]  that woman rings me up  every single day  but the problem is  it's not illegal  and i'm over 18  the minute she gets her hands on it  she doesn't even wait  till she gets home  in the car  holy shit  all of the chemicals  that are supposed to be like  cleaning electronics  she just inhales the whole thing  in her mouth  just let her go  i feel like i can conquer the world 
[01:59:00]  she goes from  being sober  to being high  her sister's hot  yeah she's cute right  okay now the rush  is coming in  coming in  coming in  last less than five minutes  unless you continue  to keep huffing  and breathing  in this can of inhalants  you immediately  become sober again  oh fuck that  she's so fucked up  this cannot last 
[01:59:30]  she's either going to have a heart attack  a stroke  they say your lungs actually burst  and i can see that that could happen  easily  sorry  stop enabling her  shit  don't allow those cans of shit in your house  yeah what are they doing  33% of inhaling deaths occur  from  she needs to punish her body  one way or another  so if she's not using drugs  she starves herself 
[02:00:00]  she goes  and cuts up her arms and legs  anorexia  anorexia  self  self mutilates  it's not one affliction  it's another  and i just alternate  between all of them  over the past  few months  it's just been getting worse  and worse  and she drives  and she's  liable to kill someone  i need more  of aerosol cans 
[02:00:30]  and i need them now  she was using duster  while driving  and  as she was huffing  she was turning a corner  and  passed out  and she actually caused  a four car  collision  yeah great  we're gonna leave this  instant  and get it  she's gotta go get more  i don't care if i sacrifice  the life of anybody else  good  that's why  i hate these fucking people 
[02:01:00]  i'm afraid she's gonna die  and shortly  if something isn't done  jesus  i'm already dead  it's very very hard for a mother  to see her child  in that amount  of pain  oh boy  is she not a likable girl  as allison  no  oof  oh  it was laying down  on the floor  it's very hard to take  is it  overindulged  it just started  when she was eight years old  oh here it is  what happened  what was the problem  when allison was born  she was the cutest 
[02:01:30]  little baby  and she  was just so special  to all of us  my sister  was a very advanced child  she walked early  she talked early  she did everything early  she sure did  after allison was born  we added to the family again  i had another daughter  erica  and you fucked her up  allison is only  two and a half years  older than i am  so we had the same babysitter  we always went to the same schools  it was always just allison and i  then one day 
[02:02:00]  i accidentally put acetylene  in her bottle  and it was all over  my point  when she was five  she and her younger sister  erica  were allegedly molested  i saw my  my baby sister  get molested  oh yeah  uncle paul  look what you did  did that scare you  well it wasn't right  her eyes  are so fucked up  it's spinning around  in her head  and there she goes  more duster 
[02:02:30]  the two little girls  had said to me  that  someone had  touched them  someone you know who  i didn't listen to them  the first few times  can you pause that for  that fucking pisses me off  you piece of shit  this is  how about you listen  to your fucking kids  i wish i had said this before  holy shit  when you said the mother  was buying her inhaler  i swear to god  my first thought is  she's guilty  she feels guilty  something bad happened  a molestation or something  and she didn't stop it  exactly  or she allowed it to happen 
[02:03:00]  and not know it  so she feels guilty  what a codependent  slob this mother is  that's what she is  she's like  i don't know  how about you listen  to your kids  when they say  they were molested  no  now i'm more mad  at the mother  yeah  the mother's a piece  of shit  she's just a codependent  fucking guilty  slob  exactly  fuck  i just thought  it's going to be  untrue  yeah  but it wasn't  it just kept escalating  children told more people 
[02:03:30]  they told  their grandmother  they told their aunt  it just kept going  it just kept getting  bigger and bigger  to the point that  i did decide to  take the girls  to their pediatrician  who's the guilty party  the alleged molester  we went through  oh god  her eyes are  great  court trials  um  psychiatrists 
[02:04:00]  it was really  fucking hard  she looks  like a lunatic  when this happened  to them  the judge did not  take them into  private chambers  the molester was  sitting in the room  actually facing them  they were  looking at him  and  looking at all the  people in the room  and they were afraid  of the lawyers  and they were just  little girls  in a horrendous  situation  perhaps you should  have fucking  believed  yeah you should  have protected  the stupid 
[02:04:30]  good one  yeah  he was acquitted  of all charges  due to lack  of evidence  the children were upset  because  i had told them  if they just told  the truth  everything would  work out  and basically  nothing came of it  they were really  angry at me  about that  they were really  really traumatized  by this  you fucked up  it was very ugly  you fucked up  and the divide  in the family  started happening  you fucked up  there were the people  that believed  the children  there were parts 
[02:05:00]  of the family  that did not  believe the children  many people  in the family  believed  that i made this up  everything going on  i mean it was  it was nasty  he looks guilty  was it the husband  i don't know  parents divorced  the same year  as the trial  i'm gonna guess  it was the father  i'm gonna guess  his father was  trying to pull her  to his side  of the family  and nancy  wants her  to stay with her  i felt as though  allison wanted  to please my mom  and please her dad  she was really  stuck in the middle 
[02:05:30]  almost as though  she had to choose  we don't know  yeah that sucks  that you have to  choose in life  yeah poor kid  whatever  poor kid  and then she just  huffs more  and it's great  i wish i would  that mother  what a codependent  guilty slob  your kids tell you  that you're being  molested  you didn't believe it  i bet it was the  again i can't  i can only guess  but i'm gonna guess  the father  because why else  wouldn't the mother  believe it  or maybe one of  the mother's  brothers or something  like that  but then they  get divorced  the same year  they were kind of  hinting right there  definitely family 
[02:06:00]  because they said  some of the family  believed it  some didn't  so  and the father  was trying to get  the kids to their  side of the family  maybe he was  who knows  gotta be like  let's say hi  to sharon osborne  everyone  sharon  good morning boys  happy new rape  hi sharon  i just wanted to  say this  allison girl  bless her heart  was blessed  with dust free  lungs  and beaten  with a burden  stick  punching out  first  let's go to  dan in  knoxville  dan  hey happy new

[02:13:00]  what's that  nothing continue  the guy is  spilling his  heart out  today  she actually  did go and  tell her two  older brothers  that this had  happened  right  and surprisingly  nobody had done  anything so  this is when she's  very young  you know she's in  her 40s now  and i'm at a  family function with  her and i  realized that  she's talking to  the uncle  like it's a 
[02:13:30]  family function  and everybody's  in the freaking  room and she's  talking to him  like nothing  ever happened  and i lost my  mind i went  that's him  that's the guy  and then the  look on her face  was like oh  shit he remembered  what i told him  oh damn  and i i lost  my mind and  both of the  brothers who  didn't do  anything were  the ones holding  me down and  but it was that  instant where you  know somebody  actually gave a  shit and did  something that 
[02:14:00]  actually forced  the family to  deal with it  and you know  it actually brought  it out in the  open people  admitted that it  happened you know  i got a little  beat up over it  but hey you know  what somebody had  to step up and  do something  are you still  with her  yes  okay and what  happened with  the uncle  um they had  you know i was  removed from the  house for a while  with a couple of  cousins uh the  you know my  girlfriend her  two brothers um  you know her mom  passed away and  everything so like  you know mom's not  there anymore dad's 
[02:14:30]  not there anymore  but like i guess  she and the two  brothers had you  know had a  conversation with  the guy and um  i guess they worked  it out how they  worked out i don't  know but i just  know that when they  finally decide to  actually sit and  talk about it i was  not allowed to be  there because i  could not control  myself all i wanted  to do was rip his  head off of course  what didn't she tell  you the resolution  uh she just said  that they they had  talked about it um  you know he he  broke down you know  felt horrible about  it you know it  was the kind of 
[02:15:00]  thing where it  was like it was  literally this is  what they told me  it was like a one  time thing but you  know it was that  one time that was  bad enough to  mentally scar her  um you know it's  the only time he  ever did it he  broke down you  know apologizing  crying you know  begging for  forgiveness and  blah blah blah blah  i don't know i  would imagine you  don't do that just  one time yeah it's  hard to imagine that  one time i mean i'm  sure one time is  bad but it's yeah  that's one time is  it's like one  cookie who has one  cookie exactly there's  a whole plate 
[02:15:30]  deliciousness thank you  very much gentlemen you  have a good day  all right brian thanks  for uh sharing that uh  that one um full of  boners  morning guys what up  mark uh not much love  the show i should live  for your show  ah so do we  but uh no i had a  buddy of mine i worked  with uh with got on  intervention and uh  over the span of a few  years developed a  pretty serious  drinking problem and  uh the company let  him go and uh he 
[02:16:00]  got himself into  rehab and some other  stuff and then he got  into intervention and  uh he passed away out  of the blue he got he  developed a soft  with deal cancer during  the problem from all  his drinking so we  all watched the show  after he passed away  it was very eerie but  talking to the wife and  everything the show is  legit man these guys  everything they show is  uh yeah i never thought  it was you know yeah we  never doubted that  i know i know i know  i'm just saying but  you would you would  think these reality  shows are scripted and  everything else i mean  they i'm not one of 
[02:16:30]  those no i i believe  what i'm seeing is real  i i just i don't think  that shows on tv to help  people i think maybe it  helps people in the end  but those type of shows  are on tv so we can look  at at freak shows we  always feel a little bit  better about ourselves don't  we yeah yeah brett was  pretty obstinate so they  really honed in on the  fact that he didn't  want to go to rehab and  he would you know argue  and and uh the strife  between him and his  kids i mean the kids  were screaming and  crying the whole time  and it was yeah they 
[02:17:00]  did play that up a lot  all right thank you  my guys love it one  show that uh i talk  about all the time about  being just so fake is  that stupid fucking repo  show sure and uh the  latest episode i just  saw a little trailer for  it or whatever the fuck  you want to call it and  uh apparently one of the  guys gets squirted in the  eyes with some kind of  insecticide and did what  could only be described as  horrid wrestling acting he's 
[02:17:30]  like i'm blind i'm blind he's  rolling around on the ground  and the cameraman's got him  and they got to get him into  the the into the ambulance he  got an ambulance and he's  like where's the ambulance  standing right over here and i  know exactly look danny we're  on the same page hold on ed  hold on yeah can you back  up a little bit yeah sure  all right what what  happened it's uh that  operation repo show it's  it's okay i knew it it's  terrible uh-huh and it's  fake and uh the latest  episode uh they showed the 
[02:18:00]  guy get uh hit in the eyes  one of the guys from  operation repo get hit in  the eyes with uh insecticide  or something yeah and he  rolls around the ground  doing like a horrible bad  wrestling acting hey anthony i  do believe i might have the  actual clip do you are  talking about all right  oh no not the beast not the  beast  oh my eyes  my eyes  that's kind of what it 
[02:18:30]  sounded like yeah  long way for a fucking  stupid fucking button joke  i love button jokes yeah i'm a  big fan of the button joke  yeah that is uh it's so fake  guy and and they show him  like being carted into an  ambulance holding his eyes  yeah and everybody's supposed  to be concerned so phony you  know they're showing avatar on  tv right now like a clip yeah  and it looks it doesn't look as  good when it's not in 3d no you 
[02:19:00]  gotta i can tell you gotta see  this in 3d yeah oh yeah it'll  probably be in the theaters for a  while i would hope oh yeah oh  fuck yeah perhaps a week uh maybe  two oh shit look at that  fucking creature man okay the  creatures in this movie are  pretty fucking cool and you  would like that i a little too  uh fakey cartoony looking for  me but i well you got the 3d i can  get past that i mean but but this  whole miracle of it in technology  and how they look they still look a  little too you know that's 
[02:19:30]  steven lang golem looks to steven  lang is the badass fucking sergeant i  think he's a sergeant i think golem  looked real in like lord of the  rings and these kind of cgi kind of  you got to see the 3d and then then  come in here and uh talk about it  all right yeah because i think i  think i'm talking on my ass no not  really but i mean the 3d really does  enhance yeah it looks completely  different is my point as as we look 
[02:20:00]  at the clip on regular tv that's  probably gonna be scary seeing these  blue monsters i bet you're not as  scary as the guy next to you in a  theater eating popcorns  oh my god speaking we don't like chip  dude i fucking hate can't wait for  chip to leave to go to la to be on  leto  no it's chip  chip goes on it's not chip uh for the  people that have seen avatar  uh i'm gonna tweet something that  danny gave me

[02:27:00]  most overplayed commercial on tv right now and we have to beat up one of our pals oh oh not yet frank  anyone wait anyone anyone which one is that i've seen anyone anyone oh not yet frank  anyone anyone what's it for dirty jobs oh oh the what a ford commercial yeah yeah yeah yeah and frank  is trying to rip down all the all the fucking yes the signs for the holidays and our pal goes oh not 
[02:27:30]  yet frank not yet frank there's still time that fucking commercial's been yeah overplayed at least  you know that one's like gonna be gone there are ones though that just for years they just go for  years like that temper the tempurpedic mattress with that stupid bitch in a nightgown like stepping on  the mattress like amazed that the wine's not tipping over wine's not tip yeah it's a tempurpedic 
[02:28:00]  mattress and and by the way it's supposed to not upset your sleeping partner when you roll around on  that if it didn't have a sheet on it i could agree with that right but once you put a sheet on it  everything the sheet becomes a movable object on top of you could not jump on that stupid bed  with a sheet on it and the of course glass of wine so stop it it will it will leave a stain yes  and then of course the chopper and and and and the fucking the cheese thing with linguine fettuccine 
[02:28:30]  martini bikini what is that hate that guy i don't know it's the guy with the cheese  twisty thing fucking paid yeah slap chop slap chop my nuts slapping my nuts potato one slap you got  nuts yeah it's a remix they have to do remixes on youtube don't they they can't just leave the  fucking commercial alone why don't we take a break we'll find that and yeah my bladder's not greaty 
[02:29:00]  not good right now and when we get back we have the uh birthday uh oh you reminded me about that  i love those we got we got a local news station that got uh pranked with more birthday wishes  for show members thank god love those and uh we we started the show pretty much talking about buck  rogers because of avatar listen to the replay if you're just tuning in it was pretty good it's just  the contrast of like avatar how it is now and in in the future state of the art state of the art and 
[02:29:30]  then you look back at what was state of the art like the 30s and it was buck rogers it was horrible  and we got more horrendous acting from buck rogers himself after the break great that will do stay  there opian anthony and jim norton all right we're back buck rogers let's get right into buck rogers  we're gonna hear a little more buck you want to set this up ant you kind of did before the break i  guess earlier we were talking about avatar and the technology behind it and how uh everybody's 
[02:30:00]  raving about 3d and what's next for the movies and this is groundbreaking and uh you know wasn't very  long ago the uh biggest science fiction uh they had was buck rogers avatar yeah yeah and i'm not  talking about buck rogers why did this go out avatar it's good buck roger yeah yeah guys sorry 
[02:30:30]  we're all sleepy i'm sleep deprived i don't know i haven't slept since when you went back on the on  the radio i was sleeping like a mofo over the break and now i can't sleep uh no what i was trying  to say i was going with what you were saying and buck rogers for the time was state-of-the-art  avatar state-of-the-art uh nowadays and and that's basically what you said but it leads to this  question what what was the last movie you saw where you went holy shit state-of-the-art like wow 
[02:31:00]  titanic no star trek's latest movie i think the the newer star trek was like what made that  different than uh some of the movies that came a year or two before just the the the space scenes  battle scenes look fucking great really yeah really do look good i think i think because  then people would say lord of the rings when they saw that was like oh wow yeah oh my god  right some of the harry potter shit maybe district nine looked good for a small budget they had a good 
[02:31:30]  cgi team on that one yeah i never saw district nine it's pretty good yeah it's white people black  people yeah that's pretty much what it is it's like enemy mine updated version of it oh really  for the most part yeah good old enemy mine all right let's get into buck rogers that's where we're  heading with this thing today uh lots of visuals should watch along with youtube vid  should watch along with youtube vid oh yeah that's how it's written should listen right should listen 
[02:32:00]  along with youtube youtube buck rogers 1939 re-edited from serial to feature format and re-release for  theatrical distribution oh uh buck rogers planet outlaws wow we're doing this just to get some  more of uh buck's horrendous acting it's the same buck oh yeah is it wait let's take a look this is 53  oh the other one was like 38 wait so it's not the same guy this could be buster crab if it's not the 
[02:32:30]  same guy then this bit doesn't work well we'll see if the guy uh acts as poorly i think we  marshall craig and assuming that you can operate a plane from the ground at such a distance mind you  by means of radio thanks steve for fucking up a bit you piece of shit fucking idiot will you pay  attention  we need fucking buck rogers audio like we just heard two hours ago not the new buck rogers because 
[02:33:00]  then the point doesn't make sense i'm surprised he doesn't have the one to go beady beady beady  fucking what's his name gerard what was his name oh george depardue no no butler george  no we were gil gil gerard how does that work it was the same that's not the same dude those were  the 1939 serials that were re-released in 1953 that's not the same guy yeah let me see him i don't 
[02:33:30]  know that's not the same guy dude i wasn't able to tell google i'm ready to apologize if it's the same  guy it looks like the same dude i mean it looks like the same quality looks like the same dude  did that sound like the same dude aunt uh i didn't hear enough of it  to tell you the truth go go to that believe me i i'd like to smash steve as much as you  so i'm not ready for this sorry yet i'm not ready for this sorry i'm sticking with piece of shit for  now all right this is this is the one we saw tiger man 35 let's get his uh end end speech

[02:35:00]  who played buck rogers in the 35 yeah well it's not the same guy it's not even close this guy is  his retarded brother let's see what his name is uh it's steve it starring no offense but the bit  doesn't work if you don't have audio of the same guy i can get sorry hope one of the one more of  this i know we don't have we don't have buck rogers from 1935 we don't have more of these this is a  one-off they did someone should have told me that because now the who's the actor he's got to be 
[02:35:30]  other things i think i see buster crab right there but no no it's saying that uh yes dan uh buster  crab was buck rogers in the 1939 serials however uh it doesn't mention that it's the same guy that's  in this 1935 how about cast for google cast of tiger man whatever it is if you scroll down it  doesn't say it we can just move on no i want to see more of this guy he has to be in other things  yes he does after a performance like this oh yes the maz maz uh tiger men tiger men the guy in the 
[02:36:00]  tiger man of mars was john dill jr there you go john dill jr john dill jr who went on to make  delicious treats that went on top of hamburgers and hey john dill and the audio i smash was who  crab guy the crab guy the crab was the grab is his then wait is dill in anything else 
[02:36:30]  look him up i would look him up in a second find everything he's in well that's the point  we want more of him we want him he's the man not the plus yeah john dill jr was the guy see what else  john dill was in go to internet movie database it says he only did one thing and that was it  that was it of course that's what imdb said but he was great why would they not hire him for anything  else he's the greatest that's all i want to do is watch john dill john dill that was the bit we 
[02:37:00]  were trying to do okay he's down nine percent in popularity this week oh he'll be back up yeah  he'll be back up all he did that's the one thing then he's dead gotta be dead we don't have any more  clips of him doing this dude that's the only thing that this guy did the 1939 serials are like a 10  part series that were combined for a 1953 theatrical release i did like the way he said that one word  though the new guy uh dakar uh yeah what did he say a decoy a decoy a decoy let's see if we can like 
[02:37:30]  this this guy it seems to me you can't afford not to try and say by the way steve it's still a piece  of shit sorry you don't get the apology gotta call it like it is  oh saturn they weren't football helmets but the bit doesn't work  he says one word weird the other guy was oh yeah and look at the special effects rule on this one 
[02:38:00]  this is mountains opening up oh look at the ship there they got their shit together now this kicks ass  look at that shit does it kick ass it's like they're all just smoking look another one of those  spaceships see it's what are they doing yeah we're just gonna watch the tv at this point  they're just gonna watch tv gonna probably that our bits ruined this is nowhere near as bad as that  first one i know i was excited to get the bad acting i know no no pilot would call them spaceships 
[02:38:30]  spaceship is there any more clips online dan of the first guy i think that was the only thing he did  that was just that 10 minute short it was i think that's the only thing he did yeah there was no  theatrical release for the dick it was just the 10 minute short that appeared at the uh the world  the chicago world's fair it's some uh pornography in the uh early 40s i believe let's go to greg  maryland greg hey guys you were talking earlier about groundbreaking movies i thought saving private 
[02:39:00]  ryan was groundbreaking the way they filmed the war scenes and the bullets and all that well yeah no  there's a lot of films that were groundbreaking i guess the question that everyone could answer  themselves is the last movie before avatar that was groundbreaking to you as a moviegoer  the wow and saving private ryan would definitely be uh on a lot of people's lists that that shit  still holds up i saw that recently oh yeah yeah saving private ryan oh yeah that shit holds up big  time period pieces like that usually do i mean you know what it's gonna do well i mean how many

[02:44:00]  and there's another guy standing outside holding a box with a pound cake in it  and he fucking passes it under the stall door malcolm takes him and passes the fucking pound  cake back under it didn't even strike me as odd let me get some of that that is disgusting it  really isn't it no it is anything in the bathroom yeah it's kind of gross to be eat you don't eat  anywhere in the bathroom i put my egg sandwich on top of the urinal yesterday that i can't even 
[02:44:30]  want drippage in my underwear that uh in your underwear well i had one last bite left why  didn't you then just stand there with your dick out take the last bite and then do the shake with  your greasy egg fingers on your fucking knob because i had a lot of egg in my mouth already  so i had to chew that still and i just didn't want to spend all that feel like waiting nah  because then i figured i could eat the last bite as i walked back uh down the hall  hmm let's go to eric in michigan eric hey you guys were talking about uh the movies that uh 
[02:45:00]  you think were like mind-blowing or really cool at the time i was going to say the matrix trilogy  because all the shit they didn't know it was just it was ridiculous when i was like 12 yeah when you  first saw that the move the matrix you know and then every movie started using it and it was in  commercials and everything but that first time you saw them you know trinity goes up and does that  thing and then you just did spin around and you're like whoa that's just that's pretty badass that 
[02:45:30]  still holds up and then everything got overused like that got overused and another thing from matrix  that got overused was the you're falling from a great height and you land in that cool kind of  leg is spread out arm is behind you you got your gun or your sword out kind of a thing yeah  and then everybody started using that blade and i mean it really sucks that it was overused because  that was that shit was awesome at the time and now every movie and especially every like kung 
[02:46:00]  fu movie out of japan has the exact same action sequences all the time i hear you very good i did  like the matrix man the first one was fucking good and that wasn't even really uh i like the other two  they depended a lot on effects and shit like that and then they the storyline got a little crazy  with a key fucking maker and shit but the first one was kind of first one was amazing whoa let's  go to peter in massachusetts peter hey um best uh eating on the shitter scene in the movies is 
[02:46:30]  bad news bears go to japan they're all in that hotel room together and they open the door and that  fat kid i think his name was ogilvy or whatever is on the shitter eating a bucket of kentucky fried  chicken can we find that clip possibly why no we're trying to find the clip  if we find it we'll play it for everybody thank you peter yeah all right uh dave in  uh california i guess we're talking about movies a little bit because this avatar thing hey this  movie came out about 10 years ago it's kind of crappy but it's the like first cgi movie all 
[02:47:00]  movie called final fantasy yeah final fantasy i never saw it myself but go ahead  or not yeah we'll play it for everybody thank you peter oh jesus all right guys uh do we have a lot  of new listeners or something which would be good for us well yeah you know what we a lot of times  we do in the beginning of the year because it was a christmas gift or people got it turned on  right remember the beginning of the year we always had a lot of new listeners another guy turning up  his radio look when you hear our voices you're on the show and don't worry about it listen to the 
[02:47:30]  replay and you'll hear yourself we have a weird delay that fucks up everybody so don't turn on your  radio as you're trying to do a phone call yes please for me that is true yeah well what  terminator 2 that was the first one with that liquid fucking shit daniel yes sir i'm my friend  hey buddy hey man uh yeah i was just gonna say that uh terminator 2 still kind of blows my mind 
[02:48:00]  even though it was like in 91 or 92 yeah that was amazing the graphics in that was amazing yeah yeah  i'm sorry go ahead yeah that one we were uh you know they had the uh the new terminator there and uh  he was like liquid metal yeah when he squeezes through the bars and he fucking changes his  hand into that sword thing and shit that that was some fucked up shit and still holds up which leads  to my next question for anthony and maybe jimmy oh the last movie uh that that uh that doesn't hold 
[02:48:30]  up from from uh recent times from graphics or from a story or for anything cgi no fuck the story just  like movie making cgi because we're talking about avatar in general something that you watch now and  go like oh that doesn't fucking hold up because all the movies we've mentioned you could pop it in  today and it pretty much holds up the terminator movies definitely matrix definitely titanic definitely  uh saving private ryan like we talked about thought the cgi ruled when you saw it and then saw it 
[02:49:00]  maybe recently went whoa didn't buck rogers the original yeah but how far back  steve from basero saying uh down the downfall he didn't like the ending  i mean we could start with star wars you see star wars now the original you're like okay it doesn't  hold up well but let's get models and stuff i know but let's get uh you know closer to 2010  a movie that you saw and it just doesn't hold up to special effects and the cgi and and all that 
[02:49:30]  jaws is even older than that i think of like flat looking before they were really  textures even holds up because how it was shot because we didn't see the shark right yeah yeah  i mean i watched that movie and the shark still looks believable don't you think until he comes  back on robert shaw right except for the boat scene a little silly but it it it works because the story  is so fucking good and the acting is great and right now that's why that movie works so well you didn't  need you didn't even need the fucking shark which is amazing you know well we gotta start somewhere  with this bit uh a movie from the 80s that doesn't hold up like does men in black hold up or men in 
[02:50:00]  black all right now you're talking jimmy independence day i think oh now you're talking  jurassic park holds up obviously uh wait that jurassic park wait let's slow down a little bit  i just watched it recently and it does hold up yeah yeah yeah it's that's fucking t-rex they could do  better now i think good but it's when you look at that you don't go ah you know like that's still great  yeah and especially for the time and that was what 93 i think that movie came out no it wasn't 
[02:50:30]  16 years ago what's the current movie jurassic park i think it was like 93 or some shit like that  you don't even want to know and if you look at cgi from back then when that was a movie when i first  saw it i went back the next day to see it again because i was just like i cannot believe they made  fucking dinosaurs look that good i will see avatar again and i never see a movie twice in the theater  never good one yeah i want to get a slightly better seat hmm the abyss i am legend we're 
[02:51:00]  thinking science i am legend does not hold up cgi sucks really get the fuck out of here that's  the movie's two years old cody what do you got that was uh the only thing that really took me out  of the movie was that the cgi was just fucking terrible hey hang on guys that theater never you  you fucking asshole can turn his radio up smarty ass i guess we're not gonna get the answer yeah  it's hard to think of anything that really the last big huge blockbuster that just doesn't hold up 
[02:51:30]  how what year do we go to jason and the argonauts i can't think of one all right then maybe it was a  dumb idea yeah well not all these ideas are gonna stick but throw them against the wall and hope for  the best that one slid down from me that one slid down the wall it's on the molding  yeah i gave it a whirl we gave it a whirl  scar face isn't uh yeah but then there are movies that very good that come out and you're just 
[02:52:00]  amazed how awful the cgi is in this day and age uh brendan i did not see gi joe hey guys i think  it's one of the worst acting movies and graphics out there period and it just came out i mean some  movies from the 90s have better cgi than this movie yeah but we're talking about a movie that everyone  went and saw and went oh you got oh that doesn't hold up you know what holds up the  the fucking remake to uh uh silence of the land ray liot his uh head uh then that was his head off 
[02:52:30]  eating his brains that was awful when it first hit the theaters it looked so fake uh get one more  boys do you know what held up well uh believe it or not is the the shootings in like those spaghetti  westerns the fucking uh the good the bad the ugly yeah yeah because leon was the first one to do like  the one camera shoot like usually it was a cutaway shot yeah but he was the first one to actually show  it and it wasn't just somebody grabbing his uh wound and falling down right no one made it 
[02:53:00]  they flipped like around but no one made it believable they were always sweaty yeah i'm  sweaty and dirty sweaty and dirty when they were dying from the gunshot lee van cleef  the good the bad the ugly but you need a whole afternoon to watch that movie yes great was there  anything better growing up when on sundays it was like the good the bad the ugly on regular tv so  i mean you would look at the tv guy forever and it would say like uh you know start to two and  seven seven at night and you would just like that would be your day though you would you would just 
[02:53:30]  lay around the couch with your dad or your family whatever just lazily watch like the good the bad  the ugly or one of those spaghetti westerns all day long commercials yeah  that was 92 jurassic park wow man get the fuck out of here jurassic park wow 18 years ago he's  starring um sir um um who's the guy that ran jurassic park he was in uh oh i know oh yes sir mix-a-lot 
[02:54:00]  sir mix-a-lot that was the guy yep look it up they had no expense look it up you'll see  uh uh you guys think we said we talked to stegosaurus oh richard attenborough sir richard attenborough  who was in the great escape by the way jeff goldblum yes jeff goldblum who was also in the great  escape and unfortunately judd hirsch didn't play his father my son is chasing the dinosaur

[02:57:30]  guy with catchphrases and going around kicking ass yeah darkness i like a good catchphrase you like a good  catchphrase movie where people are just fucking you know kicking ass taking names i  fucking hate catchphrases why they're just terrible unless they're not meant to be a catchphrase he says  something like uh at the end you know so buckle up ew why would you say that hey i can't hear it

[02:58:30]  crazy uh home invasion where's his gun some secrets take us to the edge  there are still a lot of unanswered questions but it appears detective thomas craven was the intended  target this is someone harmed and dangerous what do you think i am i like dealing with it personally  i'm coming nightmares  hey craven's phone hello 
[02:59:00]  mr craven we have things to talk about like your name and what you're doing here  like who shot your daughter you want to know what my daughter did here what she did was classified  emma charlotte craven who was flagged as a possible threat to the united states of america  oh my god it was not the type of yeah i didn't know this  blowing the whole they're blowing the whole  fucking movie you now know that she's involved she's not just an innocent daughter 
[02:59:30]  so i'm usually the guy that stops you connecting to me  you're gonna follow me in the city of boston  look up the hill  what does it feel like  all right  it's too late it's already been done  more  i'm not gonna arrest anyone i never do  ma'am gibson you are out of your depth and far from your jurisdiction 
[03:00:00]  my daughter was him a craven  i'm the guy with nothing to lose  fasten your seatbelt  all right i don't have to see that  you better decide whether you're hanging on the cross  or banging in the nails  this is taken  yeah i know  taken  yeah kind of  probably better  that didn't look as nearly bad as a travolta film  you know what though no it looks really bad and hacky 
[03:00:30]  i didn't know about that plot twist there  holy  that the daughter  why would you put that in your trailer  why do you ruin it  you don't even need to put that in the trailer  when he hooks up with his daughter there at the airport  you're kind of like all right the girl's coming home from college maybe or whatever  and you have no idea and then and then you figure he's the intended target  because he's the cop  right right she gets shot and then you realize she's in some shenanigans with the government  that's a huge spoiler  thanks  that's probably that's probably 40 minutes of the movie  yeah yeah that's a  tell you that 
[03:01:00]  giant and then you're sitting there going oh my god i didn't see that coming  giant plot twist just exposed  fuck you and your trailers stop  horrible what are you doing and uh mel gibson's um attempt at a boston accent  is really horrendous i thought he was trying to do a new york accent that was really horrendous  who was the one that did the boston accent and then halfway through the movie said you know  what i gave up on it was our pal jimmy fallon was in that baseball movie was it jimmy 
[03:01:30]  that movie yeah i don't know if it was jimmy  it was somebody  fuck i can't remember there's you know the new york and boston accent in movies are amongst the most  difficult and uh when you see an actor that can't pull it off wow takes you right the  fuck out of the movie it's horrible that's why i like seeing that goddamn stupid marky mark or his  brother donnie mark uh uh whatever uh yeah uh do boston you know do boston movies yeah they sound 
[03:02:00]  boston oh and you got stupid uh matt damon yeah you could do a boston accent he's from boston i just  hung up on 20 people sorry really yeah the movie bit's not really working i've got something else  though you can do you call this fine radio show here's hey and dig.com um did uh someone turn me  on to dig.com um giving us a little love on the mustard mustard creep video they play really i guess  they do like a half hour little show of the best videos that are hitting their site dig.com and uh 
[03:02:30]  it was pretty cool but there was something else uh in that episode that i think you would appreciate  and jimmy and stuff it did a montage of everybody going to the surveillance footage and enhancing the  video to find out who the murderer was and hence and you realize they have done the same  fucking scene for like 20 straight years really it's really really well done i don't know if danny can  find out what the enhancing a video like you're watching like uh yeah a cop show or whatever and 
[03:03:00]  they they have video and they're all looking at this video looking at the screen and go could you zoom in on  that we need the plate number can you enhance that could you do this could you digitize it and it  looks crystal clear when they're done yeah yeah instead of grainy well on dig.com i don't know  where it would be they did that on super troopers they goofed on it where he just kept going  and hence enhance and he's pressing the button on the computer and nothing was being done 
[03:03:30]  fuck where's the link it really is it shows you how bleak the writing is  uh please that is one of the worst things they do too because in this day and age you just know  when you have grainy video you can't blow it up not at all pixelated there's got to be a link on  dig.com to the uh the little internet show they dude well do you remember can you dig.com  i knew that she could shut up quickly crystal mr bush mr bush can you enhance my face all i wish is

[03:05:30]  right here with the right equipment the image could be enlarged and sharpened what's that  does it enhance my program can you clear that up any i don't know let's enhance it section 86  enhance the detail and it has to be fledged in her eye to run this through video enhancement  edgar can you enhance this hang on ed i've been working on this reflection someone's reflection

[03:12:00]  to him tomorrow he's miserable we could bring up our favorite different strokes moments  he would love that i think we did that oh what are we doing with gary coleman tomorrow um if he was  here we could kick him for a while he had a cameo in the film dirty work did he played uh the devil  and the hallucinations wow really bring that up i don't say what you're talking about  i think he did i think he did actually we could get him to say that to us each person on staff could 
[03:12:30]  come in and he could first say you know what you're talking about travis and then and what is gallagher  gonna do last time gallagher was on the show we destroyed the uh k-rock studio and they were really  mad at us he smashed really mad birthday cake last time yes there was cake everywhere look  he's smashing something tomorrow yeah so is so you get with the uh you know who's down the hall  the upper management nothing but pleasantries okay nothing but pleasantries we'll make sure  that we have some kind of edible goody that gallagher can uh smash with the sledge-o-matic

[03:13:30]  was contained in a smaller the trumpet band and the sweaters were contained in a smaller uh more  secluded what was the buzz in that show did anyone give a shit no but they did have cupcakes  these are pleasantries anthony pleasantries for the new year i understand nothing but pleasantries  only day two there was there was slightly more buzz about the homeless talent show than about the  sweater festival the sweater festival and he just laughed well as well he should i mean it was 
[03:14:00]  probably a lot of fun i didn't get a chance to hear it i'm sure there's no there's no place on radio  for a sweater festival i'm sure they love hearing this given the fact that they had to give up the  yeah they gave up their studio fucking shenanigans they were not happy that they did they get a thank  you from me or aunt no no and we're gonna keep it that way wow when we need your fucking studio you  move out with your dumb sweaters and trumpeteers and go somewhere else trumpeteers they were not 
[03:14:30]  happy that day that we went into their studio yeah uh while they were on commercial break and asked  that they give up this sweater studio you know what's the worst part of it is they said  no there's no way so we've been we've been promoting this for months this is like a big deal for us  yeah you can't and then and then yeah we all know what happened smelly homeless yeah we thought of  this idea two days before and we're taking your studio that was insulting your promotion

[03:17:30]  it was like a like a like a like a like an inflatable thing but it's heavy on the bottom and  then you just kept him back and you kept punching it and it would pop right back up  you think gary coleman would pop back up if you know because if you remember he said he's got that  disease was it him or no is that other what was that little freaky kid that came in here  that had the same diseases he was a motivational speaker oh yeah he wasn't a kid he wasn't a kid  i don't give a shit that's uh i actually follow him on twitter sean by size yeah or sean stevens

[03:19:30]  wheelchair rolled out onto the patio wasn't that what happened his wheelchair rolled out onto the  patio and it fell over and he broke like every bone of his body and the ambulance came and they  tell him no don't pick him up or something just he's so fragile the guy's like fucking fine china  like crystal just waking up in the morning he breaks a bone oh damn it oh my god  how frustrating that is old fucking champagne flute stem legs yeah they could never take him 
[03:20:00]  to the hospital he said like his parents would just have to like yeah just throw him in bed and  hope he'll stop moving when he wound up healing like fucking a turnip  poor little fucker but now that i look at the picture that's not abs uh that's uh that is individual  ribs sticking out yeah yeah those are those are not abs i remember him lifting up his shirt like this to  show us that he had abs because he works i retweet this picture today definitely he said he had no  problem getting chicks he's just banging oh yeah you know it's going crazy just going on yeah what 
[03:20:30]  should i write this this is the little thing we're talking about how we do these things and you  started saying i like the guy he's motivational and now you're just this is this it doesn't take  long for us to just turn right around i like the guy motivational speaker i'm gonna tweet this freak  he's probably following you and he'll look at me like oh what finally someone accepts me for  the motivational speaker and not the fact that i'm off fuck sam you should live my life i'm 
[03:21:00]  tormented all the time i try to do the right thing and say that but then i do get sucked in too easy  so what what should i write this is the thing the thing that we talked about this morning oh my  i can't write that he does follow me the breakable does he follow you this is the breakable thing okay  yeah so then that's not as bad this is the breakable the breakable thing you sure what 
[03:21:30]  else can i write tiny little thing and help me out this is the breakable thing breakable thing  that we were making fun of this morning yeah to make ourselves feel better feel better about  ourselves yeah all right make that might help this make us feel better because he's a motivational  speaker he can understand he's motivating us he could take it remembering us this is the breakable  thing that we made fun of i love how people think we just make this shit up but no that's  gonna be on my twitter in a second this is the breakable thing that we made fun of this more uh 
[03:22:00]  this morning and what's next how to go back all right this morning to make us feel better about  ourselves well he said that like the things people say about him doesn't bother him he's confident  in himself so this should be fine yeah about how we're oh i can't write this yeah yeah yeah that's  good ourselves all right and send tweets here it goes op radio on twitter he is following you i remember 
[03:22:30]  he is oh now he's gonna read that yeah oh look look uh my name came up i'm gonna oh oh no  and i wonder and i wonder every day i go home right and this is me in my apartment just waiting for  the phone to ring yeah yeah just never wonder why  make new friendships and then just fucking yeah that should be a new year's resolution what destroy 
[03:23:00]  our friendship no i i'm saying like we already did like maybe maybe try to make a one new friend  the whole year i don't think i made any friends in no new friends last year last year dude i haven't  really made any friends who's the last friend i would say ever ever you're right now let's i think  danny's the last friend i made oh that was years ago yeah right all right so i guess we got um 
[03:23:30]  gary coleman and gallagher tomorrow yeah all right it's gonna be a hell of a show  fred from brooklyn's going thanks aunt you know there's a you know fred i like you believe me come  up with the house everything's cool stuff but as far as a friend goes like you know it's like a friend  is you know hey we're going to atlantic city it's going to atlantic city kind of a thing it's like  frank you go i like like you you you and uh our young samuel i'm not friends with sam you think 
[03:24:00]  you're friends with sam no i'm not i think it's a clever ruse oh is that it a clever ruse it's just  convenient for me i think the two girls are friends is that what it is we usually just stare at each  other yeah yeah is that what it is is it all awkward always when the girls are just yapping  away yeah but about products about yeah they like have so much in common and then you two are  just like hey yeah so did you see that story yeah we're gonna be able to hit on that on monday i 
[03:24:30]  think it'll be a good uh he starts talking about the show and you just kind of look at him and you  start talking about wrestling he looks at me throws you out the window right that's right throws you  through the fucking window into the river that is pretty much it yeah if you ever break up with your  chick we're done i know yeah that's probably why you're hanging that happens yeah and a lot of  relationships are based on your friendships are based on your relationship right like sometimes 
[03:25:00]  you get some of the friends and and the girl gets others and sometimes you just don't get any  and she gets them all and sometimes you both don't get any uh which is the way i like it it'd be  uncomfortable for me though because i'd still hopefully work here but jess would still be going  over to obi's house to hang out with lindsey and well or just come over my house why would she  come over the house what she might come over my house then why would she go over to your house  she's never even been to your house but i'm thinking if you two break up yeah like i would 
[03:25:30]  welcome her over she could come over and hang out and why would if salmon just break up right i  will bring just to your house that would be cool why wouldn't we could all hang out we'll have a  couple of cocktails and stuff she drinks right i mean she will have a cocktail oh sure you know  a cocktail she knows how to drink and hang out she enjoys a good movie yeah she's good  how do you know answer the questions personal movie theater i guess you have and and uh uh 
[03:26:00]  watch a movie i think that'd be a lot of fun ice age uh i got everything yeah yeah she likes i say  and then uh if you break up during the warm weather i'm predicting some jacuzzi times she  actually likes to go jogging pool she likes to go jogging early in the morning how do you know all  these fun things chase her around the house then she enjoys a good early morning jog what do you  know what she does in the morning yeah yeah does she like an early morning i mean she does i don't  know how this is public that's kind of uh sexy though because does she come in like kind of 
[03:26:30]  a little out of breath a little sweaty maybe a little bit she gets a workout that's kind of  that's that's pretty sexy when she runs she has her hair in a ponytail so how do you know how she  has her hair yeah it swings back and forth this is the morning how do you know cute and everything  very very cute oh damn yeah yeah so she's invited the second you guys break up can we both like can  i go over no no no that'll be then you'll be you'll be what they're called what's called persona  non grata but uh which means keep the fuck away from my house even now though like a camera's 
[03:27:00]  outside i'll see you no i know but while we're still together while we're not broken up  can i don't see any upside to that like we could just hang out yeah no no you got an opie to hang  out with like that not so much that's the thing but it would be even more awkward what would you  because then what are we gonna do the three of us will hang out or me danny you and your chicken  invite some people hope he can come yeah well i know but he you can go and see him in his place 
[03:27:30]  what do you mean oh damn what come over i don't know i feel like this conversation is taking a turn  for the south turn for the south that's an expression i just got i think it's gone south or  taking a turn for the worse yeah yeah that's right i'm hearing from a third party oh shit that  she's good at sexting oh boy oh wow really well see here's the thing i know what party i love doing 
[03:28:00]  that sexting thing here's what the party you're hearing things oh it's fun club soda kenny would  be that party because he has a thing where for whatever reason he has her blackberry messenger  oh how'd that happen oh he'll uh it's a little suspect it is he'll text her t-e-x-t text her  something completely innocent and then all of a sudden at the end of the conversation say we're sexting 
[03:28:30]  that's what we're sexting yes what an asshole he is that's funny are you talking to kenny he's got to  tell her that they're sexting yes and then it's uncomfortable there's no sex talk i'm finding out  now from who could you um from her what do you mean from her if she's sexting right now  forward me her uh number no there's no reason to yeah no i think it'd be cool that i have see if  you had a blackberry we could barcode no they don't barcode you had a fucking you can barcode 
[03:29:00]  right i feel like a bump i don't like bump it when i could barcode i rather bump let's do  a barcoder um none of the above need her phone number need jess's phone number i think i should  have it i don't think it's a good idea just in case what if something happens to you here on the job  i should be able to call and say look uh i mean i fired sam well first of all you're cordially  invited over to the compound that implies a lot of things number one leaving in ten minutes oh 
[03:29:30]  who are you texting what why are you texting jess that you're leaving we're sexting  yeah sam will be here until wow jesus at least three p.m that's beyond inappropriate she is just  cute as a button too i thank you i know face of hers oh you want to squeeze her cheeks and just go  oh she's gonna do that i said do you squeeze her cheeks and go oh i've never said day long  what do you mean she would love that she wants that bad say oh well then i'll do it for me to

[03:38:00]  because it pushes things everything through faster well i mean you could eat and then use the facilities  when you're finished greatest treat of all time jess oh well i mean you guys don't know but  she is a treat to be around believe what you want sam you know i heard a lot about filet mignon before  i had it and knew it was great well i know it's gonna be great that's all well i hope saying you're

[03:39:00]  flames all right i hope not well if if it happens if it happens i guess i'd be out of control but let  her know that's all i will tell her you're my number right i have your number give her my number  i i mean you're the boss i'd rather not i don't like thinking of myself as the boss but since you  put it that way i do have some authority over the minion i mean you would have complete authority

[03:41:30]  him with a sledgehammer yes i think i've trotted upon a few but wow i bet you it's safe to assume she  has no arsehole hairs  kenny kenny is the worst man just a wager from a happily married man  he's willing to bet  oh my god okay i mean yeah i've had it kenny oh yeah

[03:43:00]  he give you a pat down i would not he was a detective for many years like a real pat down  not a sexual he might have a bomb in his underwear yes if you will please i would  against the door and spread him no a police pat down not not just frisk him  now put your hands behind your back put your hands behind your back this is your fingers  all right now now he's gonna hold them  now he's got to make sure wait don't resist don't resist you up you will be tased sir 
[03:43:30]  be still stand up  sam i it's a police pat down what are you doing we've seen you suck on dildos and kiss men this is  just a pat down what if you had a pat down you acted like this do you think the cop would be that  cordial with you this is against my new year's resolution you would have a knee on the back of  your neck right now well yes but i haven't committed any uh crime would you would you agree to a 
[03:44:00]  police that girl no well from whom kenny a real police pat down he he's the only guy that was on the  job come on no i probably would rather not because kenny is uh let it be known that sam is on the  floor right now are you crying uh well yes i see a tear coming out of your eyes i think you're  crying what happened because kenny is uh the first place that he checks would be my genitals my groin  area and that makes you cry well i mean it's not a pleasant he's got a tear why you got a tear 
[03:44:30]  you got a tear in your eye well i was laughing and there's emotions that are happening and  there's violations that are attempting they haven't yet been you know followed through but  they are being attempted there's no intentions here i just wanna i think i i was saying i don't  have enough friends yeah i want a new friend in in 2010 that's my goal and i think jess uh from the  pictures i've seen and hanging out with her in the limited time that i have seems like a very cool 
[03:45:00]  person that i could be friends with that's all that's all that's always trying to think we have  a lot in common when she seems funny that's all well and good but still kenny is trying to pat down  my genitals yeah yeah we just want to know how big you are my new year's resolution is to stop doing  gay activities on the radio if that has to be a resolution just forget it that's never good it doesn't  what do you think yeah how do you work for the show if that's your new year's resolution yeah really 
[03:45:30]  well i do other things and what's a day like that's just a made-up day new year what does that  even mean e-rock e-rock was smelling our index fingers today yeah well let's have e-rock get  a genital patch on then so it's like all right get e-rock i'm not gonna that's fair that is fair  e-rock should have a genital patch can he just drag him in here let him go i've been forthcoming  with information today so i think that e-rock should be the one who gets a genital patch i'm  and forthcoming with the it's not gay of course not how many times did you do the police pat down 
[03:46:00]  over the years uh countless and believe me the genitals are the place you have to check the  most thoroughly because they assume that they're not going to touch there yeah here comes here i'm  under suspicion of no e-rock would you mind if kenny gave you a legit police pat down for real  there's no shenanigans here well i mean he does go for the genitals no it's a police pat down yeah
