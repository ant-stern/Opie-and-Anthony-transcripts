<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the unveiling of new, sexually explicit radio sweepers created by producer Jimmy, featuring an "ambiguously gay duo" and highly suggestive content involving Opie and Anthony.  Callers and the hosts reacted with laughter and shock to the graphic nature of the sweepers.  The conversation then veered to Anthony's failure to return a leased Lexus, prompting a humorous recounting of his nine-month evasion of repossession (or, as a recovery agent who called in clarified, "recovery") of a Monza.

A large portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls reacting to the sweepers, with many callers contributing their own sexually explicit comments and jokes. The show then moved to a discussion of a New York Magazine article profiling the show, detailing its outrageous segments (including bingo games based on bra sizes, blind boxing matches with disabled listeners, and the throwing of objects at a stripper), guest interactions, and the hosts’ relationships with their girlfriends. Opie’s girlfriend, Sandy, even called in to share a story about catching Opie masturbating.

The show transitioned to a segment focusing on Earl, a regular contributor experiencing distress over on-air abuse, particularly a nickname, "Invisible Man."  Opie admitted to playing "Soldier of Fortune" during a meeting meant to address Earl's concerns.  Earl ultimately chose to stay, but the hosts brainstormed humorous ways to write him off the show (helicopter crash, disease, dream sequence, being shot, or a "Scooby-Doo" style reveal). This was followed by a fabricated Rick news story about the Olsen twins making a sexually suggestive movie about Jenna Bush’s college years, and a discussion involving Marco’s experiences in Provincetown, Massachusetts, including detailed descriptions of sexual encounters with gay men. This segment included a call from Randy who engaged in flirty banter with Marco, further discussing gay sex. A brief musical interlude and a guest appearance by Barry Williams followed, leading to more crude jokes and conversations.

Barry Williams' appearance involved anecdotes from *The Brady Bunch*, including suggestive banter about Marcia Brady's development and the show's set design. He discussed his book, *Growing Up Brady*, its original title ("Growing Up Brady, Inside Marsh's Marsh"), and his own, explicit Brady Bunch movie.  The conversation included behind-the-scenes gossip about the cast and crew, including Robert Reed's sexuality and a date Williams had with Florence Henderson.  Listener calls followed, with increasingly vulgar questions about the cast, met with equally crude responses.  Jim Brewer, Angel (a recently released Puerto Rican political prisoner), and Old Dirty joined the studio, leading to a chaotic, rambling discussion about Angel's arrest, government assistance programs, and the Vieques bombing, filled with racial slurs and offensive language.

The show continued with a discussion of scams involving government assistance programs, including methods for avoiding rent and medical bills, punctuated by offensive jokes and derogatory comments about various ethnic groups.  The hosts heavily criticized Sarah Jessica Parker's MTV Movie Awards hosting, using offensive and sexist language.  Remarkably, Sarah Jessica Parker herself called in, leading to a heated but humorous exchange.  Initially upset, she eventually invited the hosts to the *Sex and the City* set. The call ended with more offensive language and sexually suggestive humor.  The broadcast concluded with the hosts discussing Parker's call and their surprise.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All power, power, power by Opie and Anthony. All owned by Inquinity Broadcasting. The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station. 1027 WNEW. New York. Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with? 1027 WNEW. 
[00:00:30]  212-757-1027, Anthony. This is going to be a little awkward, but we have some new sweepers for our radio show.  New sweepers. We always like the new sweepers. The clever little things that are put together by production that sort of give you a little taste for the show.  It's put together by Jimmy. And Jimmy does a great, great job. All those incredible sweepers you hear going in and out of commercials, that's all Jim's work.  You've heard the ones that feature maybe Louis Black talking about how he'll go to court with the girls from the voyeur bus, that whole thing. 
[00:01:00]  The montage of me, Adam, and Jeffrey Ross imitating Louis, you know, and then put in with music, things like that.  Well, he's got a new concept. A new concept. He has O&A gay sweepers.  Look, they're his ambiguously gay sweepers for the show. I thought we went that route already. 
[00:01:30]  A little concept that he's been working on. And, you know, the guy worked really hard on these things.  Okay.  We were going to smash him and just move on with the show.  You know, Mapplethorpe worked hard, too. Doesn't make the picture good.  Adam, do you have to leave in five minutes or something?  No, I have to leave at five o'clock.  Five? Five. Oh, look.  Why are you so busy?  I have to go. I'm at Town Hall tonight for the Jerry Red Wilson benefit.  I know.  Okay.  But what time is that? 
[00:02:00]  The car's going to come get me. I have to go and wash.  You don't do cars, though?  Jesus Christ, my pal.  Look at my pal.  Don't talk, Mr. Lexus.  You're going to start?  Look, Anthony has to give back his Lexus.  Fine.  I'm not giving it back.  I remember laying under that bug going, the oil's going in my eye.  I have a Volkswagen.  Yeah.  Look. Look.  What?  I was supposed to give the Lexus back today.  I'm not giving it back.  I'm telling you, I'm not giving it back.  He refuses to give the Lexus back.  Possession, nine-tenths. It's mine. I have it. 
[00:02:30]  I'm used to this. Remember my Monza, GMAC?  Uh-huh.  GMAC financing.  For some reason, they get a little upset when you didn't send a payment.  Right.  And the GMAC turned into, get me Anthony's car.  Yeah.  I hid my car nine months without one payment.  Nine months.  I was like, 22.  Did the repo guy finally get it?  Finally got it.  Someone ratted me out.  He had the Philadelphia experiment, like, I can cloak this.  I did.  I was trying to do this on a cloaking device. 
[00:03:00]  Wait.  Slow down.  So you had a car for nine months, and they finally got it?  I had a...  How did you hide it from everyone?  I had a Monza.  Right.  And I couldn't afford the payments.  But I didn't care.  You know, I really didn't go for...  I had a crappy job.  I was a kid.  And the repo guy came to where I worked.  Came to my job.  I was doing some machine shop work for pennies.  And he said, look, I'm taking your car.  And I begged, pleaded.  I'm just like, look, I will pay you.  You come here tomorrow. 
[00:03:30]  It's where I work.  I will give you a check.  Just, I'm working.  You could come here.  You could get it tomorrow.  But I have a check for you tomorrow.  I then went in and quit my job.  Because I figured I could get another job with a car.  Yeah.  But I couldn't get to the job I had without a car.  So I had to leave.  You had a choice to make.  And I just pictured this big bruiser getting there the next day.  I mean, he made it his mission to get this car.  Nine months I went without them getting my car. 
[00:04:00]  I had a different address.  I would park it in train station parking lots.  Take the train to my house.  I mean, this is what I was doing to hide this car.  And then someone ratted me out for like a bounty.  It's almost like Mafia Mom.  And so they finally got my car.  But how did they get it?  I mean, how did they know where you were parking it?  Somebody ratted me out.  You didn't even have a home back then.  I was great with this.  Yeah, for like a month or two, I was living out of the car.  It was horrible. 
[00:04:30]  Very, very hard time.  So where was the car when they finally repoed it?  It was in one of the train station parking lots.  Someone spotted me.  That guy, that big bruiser guy had a mission.  I effed him over and he was pissed.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  We don't like to be called repo men.  We are recovery agents, all right?  You don't like to be called a repo man?  No.  It's just degrading.  We're recovery agents, all right?  Did you hear about the repo guy that took the...  I just heard this in the news.  He hooked up a car when the guy went into a bank to do some of his banking. 
[00:05:00]  And there were two kids in the car.  He hooks it up and just takes it away.  And now he's in trouble, man.  You can't be taking the kids along with the car.  Hey, Chris, next time you have to recover a car, give us a call, okay?  All right.  Recovery agent.  You're a repo man.  It's a guy with a slim jim.  They're car thieves that actually figured out a way to do it legally.  Did you ever see Repo Man in the movie?  Yeah, it was a little too spacey, a little too weird for me.  I liked it a lot.  A little too weird. 
[00:05:30]  Pablo Picasso would never be called a...  ...hole.  Look at you doing lines for a movie.  Thank you.  This was one of my favorite movies of all time.  All right, you want to do the gay sweepers, Anthony?  Yeah, what is this now?  They made sweepers.  And it's based on the ambiguously gay duo theme from SNL cartoons.  Now, I don't want Jimmy insulted because he does all the production for our show and he does a great job.  He really does.  But I don't know if we would just throw these sweepers into the general rotation. 
[00:06:00]  I think it would, I don't know, it would perk some people up out there.  And I don't know if we want to go down that road.  The old dirt road.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, let's give a listen and we'll all judge together.  All right?  We have to decide if these should go into the rotation.  All right.  Okay?  So I'll listen along.  They're really gay.  Great.  They're extremely gay.  That's a winner.  It's our turn of the barrel, Anthony.  Here it goes.  We weren't even going to play them on the air.  Let's hear what Jimmy put together.  I don't even want to push this button. 
[00:06:30]  They're not gay.  I haven't heard this yet.  You've heard them?  Oof.  All right.  Okay.  Are you ready?  No, but let's go.  All right, here it is.  Are you sure?  Okay, here it is.  Give it a try.  Opie and Anthony.  The ambiguously gay.  I love it already.  Great.  Oral.  Yes.  Suck it at you whore.  What a mess. 
[00:07:00]  The ambiguously gay.  1027 WNEW.  That's a winner.  All right, look.  Mm-hmm.  What?  What is that?  I don't know.  Maybe Jimmy's mad at us.  He gave them to, like, Ben and Rick and said,  here, but these in the rotation.  Oh, yeah.  Just let it fly. 
[00:07:30]  It's me sucking Opie's c*****.  All right.  I had to dump out of myself.  Great.  Great thing.  As I was saying, it's me sucking Opie's c*****.  Great.  Great.  Great sweeper.  Yeah, that's not real ambiguous.  You pretty much know what's going on.  You're pretty much doing the game, right?  Yeah, there's no room for doubt.  That's blatant.  You just want to throw it in. 
[00:08:00]  Be part of the rotation.  Rotation?  Without us commenting about it.  All of a sudden, we would go to commercial,  and that's what you would hear.  Jay from Nutley.  Um, what?  Joe from the Upper West Side.  Way to suck that C, Ant.  Woo, that's a winner.  Are you kidding?  There's two more, Anthony.  Oh, there's more.  Yes.  Gay, gay, gay, three to seven.  People are loving this. 
[00:08:30]  That sucks.  Literally.  Are you kidding?  This guy, that was the funniest effing thing, man.  Oh, yeah, it's funny.  I'm on the receiving end.  Definitely put it in.  Freaking funny.  Hold on a second.  Now, Ant, we might have a problem.  We might have to put it in rotation.  Max, what's up?  Yeah, Ant, you're not kidding.  You're on the receiving end.  Max.  Those things are freaking funny.  All right.  Thank you.  Ant, did you swallow? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, Doug from Springfield.  Doug?  What's up?  You guys are doing your next road show in the city, right?  In the village.  Christopher Street.  Yeah.  Butt sex.  That's a great sweeper.  Doug wants to ask Ant if he took it all.  Oh, jeez.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Penises.  A giant.  Well, you weren't like that.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  How's that for a topper?  Oh, ho, ho.  All right.  Well, now you've got to play the other one. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  We'll play the other two.  Oh, great.  Kevin?  Hey, listen, man.  You guys, you've got to keep that ambiguously gay duo, man.  It's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  All I want to know is who's the wife and who's the husband.  Easy.  See?  See, it's our turn in the barrel today.  Oh, and gay.  Three to seven.  How many ribs did Anthony take?  Referring to yesterday's show.  Very good.  Anthony, your Pottery Barn catalog's on the way.  You want to hear the second one?  We have three.  Yeah.  Here's the second one.  Supposed to just go on a rotation.  Like it's no big deal. 
[00:10:00]  Okay.  Here it is.  Opie and Anthony.  The ambiguously gay duo.  I am gay.  I want hard C.  I'm terminal fag.  I love C.  Ass nut.  Gay oral.  Try your C in this mouth.  It's an F best with bad junk.  Very nice.  Junk.  Man ass.  Glows oral.  Ass.  Penis.  Gags your balls out.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:10:30]  We want your penis.  Be ambiguously gay duo.  Oh, my God.  Steve was scared to even play it for me.  You've got to be kidding.  Steve goes, uh, are you in a good mood?  Because I want to play something for you.  Yeah.  Well, you have to understand, Jim's been working on these for about four months.  These are all the drops and stuff.  Is he going to get mad?  No.  No, no.  I don't think he's mad. 
[00:11:00]  I think he was just waiting to find out what you guys were going to say about him.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes.  But you're right.  I was a little apprehensive to play these for you this morning.  Well, that one didn't have an act.  Well, there you go.  Adam, putting it in perspective for us.  I'm trying to help.  Great.  Nick.  Hey, when are you guys guesting on Will and Grace?  Easy.  Next week?  Thank you.  Keith, you're next on Eddie W.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, dude?  I thought Ron and Fez were on at noon. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  Any comments about the second one?  Anthony starring in Cabaret next week.  Anthony, do you want to take the wiffle ball bat challenge?  Charles Nelson, Ant.  Ant, you still haven't returned your copy of the first wife's club.  Pitcher or catcher?  Spit or swallow?  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on?  I want to know if O and A stands for oral and anal.  We're getting cats. 
[00:12:00]  That's funny.  See, we share and this is what happens.  E from New York.  Not only does it suck, but it also blows.  Yes, it does.  You ready for the third one?  No.  Well, here it is.  Hey, Anthony, let's get naked.  No, never.  Take that shirt off there.  No, just go along with it.  You are gay.  I hate Bush. 
[00:12:30]  He loves junk.  I'm pulling out my junk.  Nice.  Now I'm ready for action.  You're obviously a stud.  Let's get naked.  Opie, could you take my pants off?  Yeah.  Naked, he's just what I imagined him to be.  Yeah.  I'm going to ask like a nine-year-old boy.  Yes, Anthony.  Screw me, Opie.  Okay.  Dick.  Ass.  Painful.  Dick.  Ass.  Painful.  I love junk.  I love ass.  Grown men jumping all over each other.  I'm going to touch myself. 
[00:13:00]  The Amiguously Gage and Rolls.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  That's a winner.  You see, okay, none of that one.  Why am I taking it again?  But you know what?  That had a character arc.  You were very coy in the beginning.  I was coy in the beginning.  You were a little coy in the beginning.  And then I opened up to things.  Yeah.  There was a whole little story going on there.  Is your car ready, Adam?  Unbelievable. 
[00:13:30]  I'd take it in that one.  You took it in two out of the three.  What the?  And the second one wasn't even...  What's that?  Whatever, Ben?  What did Ben say?  You're giving us more drops, Ant.  Just keep talking.  Yeah.  I can't believe you're just going, but I'm taking it in that.  Like you prefer to be giving it?  No.  No, I prefer that they not even be made.  But if they are there, how come I got to take it in two of them?  And then in the second one, it's not like anyone's taking it. 
[00:14:00]  It's just kind of a vague gay thing.  Opie doesn't take it at all.  No.  You're his bitch.  The first and third one.  So basically, your complaint is Opie's selfish.  Yeah.  All right.  I get no payback.  Oh, brother.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I wanted to know when you're going to be on the next episode of Queer as Folk.  I want to make sure I see that one.  I want to know if Anthony takes his good hope.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  So there you have it. 
[00:14:30]  That's awful.  I mean, I understand Jimmy worked on it a long time, which I find a little strange also.  He decides to go in that direction.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, I just want to welcome Anthony to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Great.  And I'm going to head to the plane throw down at the Glory Hole, and I want to divide him down for his first drink.  No problem.  All right.  We'll see you.  We're getting killed on the phones now.  Tim, what's up?  Howdy.  Hey.  Faggots.  Chocolat starts in 30 minutes.  Get chocolat. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, man.  Fred, what's up?  Yeah, I finally learned on O&A that Anthony has no gag reflex.  That's good.  I'm really enjoying this segment.  My God.  Dave?  Yes?  Hey.  I heard Vaseline is the new sponsor of your guys' show.  Yeah.  Oh.  Congratulations.  Hey, Cindy.  Mike?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, O&A. 
[00:15:30]  Hey.  Hey, I thought it was great.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, you guys have a great show.  I think you opened up your demographic.  Dave?  Shut up, Adam.  Amongst other things.  Your car's outside.  Dave.  Opened up.  I came to plug, but it has a double meaning now.  Yeah, see?  Hop on, Adam.  Steve, what's up?  Everyone else is.  Hey.  You guys should change your name to Neil and Bob.  Well, no.  Good job, bud, Jimmy.  Out of all the clips we've done on this show to put together... 
[00:16:00]  I would guess thousands of clips to choose from.  You decide to go in that direction.  I want to defend myself.  All my sound bites came from the Sally the F slut doll thing.  There's no defending.  I'm going to try, though.  Put together like that.  Oh, what do you think?  Everybody's thinking, wow, what show was that from?  Where they were, you know, banging each other.  They must have hung a mic in the office.  I missed that one.  Because all the clips were put together so smoothly. 
[00:16:30]  Joe, what's up?  What's going on?  I'm just going to tell you guys that the XFL has turned you guys from tight ends to wide receivers.  Ah, that old gag.  Thank you, Bob Nelson.  All right.  All right, let's take a break.  Great job.  You know, suddenly, Hospitaliano ain't so bad.  You know, when it's my turn in the barrel, I can handle it.  Hospitaliano.  Can you guys leave us alone?  We took our turn in the barrel. 
[00:17:00]  Doug?  Yeah, this is what happens when you watch too much Oz.  Oh, that must be it.  Rick Fox wants your number.  Rob?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up, man?  I want to know when Anthony's doing a duet with Eminem.  We're getting killed, Dad.  Greg, yeah.  Like you didn't expect it.  Let's play this.  Greg.  Yeah, I just want to know when you guys are playing the next game. 
[00:17:30]  What's in my mouth?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  All right.  That was good.  All right.  Thanks.  So, I guess the answer's no.  I guess the answer's no.  Very funny, right?  The crying game.  That's good.  Jerry.  Be quiet.  What's going on?  What's up, Jerry? 
[00:18:00]  I wanted to know who got hit in the face with more balls.  Yogi Berra or Anthony?  Good one.  You got me.  Ass F.  Exactly what we expected.  So, I guess the answer would be no.  Is 30 Rock a gay bar?  People are so funny.  Savage.  Hey, Chris.  Are you going to be taping Match Game 2001 tonight?  How's that for a popper? 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Let's move on.  Okay.  Good.  Good job.  All right.  You guys are Dodge and Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.  Yeah, we're back with the O&A show.  We got to go right to the phones.  Let's see what Mike has.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Opie, I just wanted to know, did you pack up your lunch today? 
[00:19:00]  Pack your lunch?  Don't you make $10 million a year because you buy your own lunch cheap fashion?  Thank you, Mike.  Are you munching on grapes?  All right, all right.  He's munching on grapes.  I haven't been through this article yet.  The article's hilarious.  He's talking about the New York Magazine article on us that came out today,  the August 20th edition of New York Magazine on newsstands now.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I got a question for Anthony. 
[00:19:30]  What do you like?  Find a fountain of youth or something?  I mean, a Time article said you were 39 and this article says you're 38.  Yeah, I know.  I keep losing years.  And another thing.  How do you like to be compared to a vibrator?  I haven't gotten to that point yet.  That part's funny, too.  Goddamn.  Thank you, Rich.  All right, guys.  All right.  We should go through this article, man.  There's a lot of great little things in here.  Man, every article that comes out on us, they just have a completely different spin of what the show's about. 
[00:20:00]  One of these days, one of these guys will get it perfectly.  You know?  Oh, geez.  I vibrate.  Okay.  Yeah, they say you're twitching stuff.  Vibrate when he's not doing anything.  Oh, God.  Yeah, okay.  I, like, loosen up when I'm sitting here.  And I do believe when he was in, what was I doing?  I think I was doing the guy, the shop at home guy.  Yeah, Don West.  And after that, yeah, my neck hurts. 
[00:20:30]  So you started, like, twitching and stuff?  Oh, well.  You got it.  You know, that's why we hate having these guys watching us.  Because they watch everything.  Because it's the smallest thing.  I'm not twitching like Norton, but, you know, maybe I want to go through some of this or what?  My shoulders.  This is New York Magazine, August 20th.  It's on newsstands now.  Headline, gross profits.  Lesbian catfighters, blind boxers, aging strippers.  Aging.  These are a few of radio hosts Opie and Anthony's favorite things. 
[00:21:00]  Now they've helped the duo win an estimated $30 million contract to go national.  God damn John Minnelli from the Post at that figure.  That is wrong.  Very wrong.  We're doing well now, but not $30 million well.  Shut up, Rick.  There's some funny stuff in here.  Don't make enough money that someone else can't pack Opie's lunch.  It's...  He's packed your lunch.  I got to see that part.  I have an explanation for that, Anthony.  All right. 
[00:21:30]  All right, so the article starts off.  What's going on with the amputee girl?  Anthony, cool me it demands during a break in the Opie and Anthony show.  But neither partner Greg Opie Hughes, nor producer Ben Sparks, nor any of the handful of 20-something interns and assistants has an idea of what's happened to the woman who promised to come in and show off her prosthetic foot.  The last time I spoke to her, she was leaving work offers a producer the guys call Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky rules.  Stinky, you're now...  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, producer Stinky.  Thank you very much.  Stinky, producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  Ying Yang party, man!  Ying Yang party.  That's too funny.  Kumia sips a bottle of Budweiser and shakes his head wearily.  Must have been a Bud Spot.  As he...  As he and Hughes face each other across the width of a peninsula-shaped console of switches and dials.  At the end of which, someone's carved...  I love Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  Producers run in and out of the cramped studio waving notes in front of their faces.  There's a half hour left on today's show.  They've already played bingo with collars bra sizes, and one of the contestants for the planned blind boxing bout has canceled.  Damn it.  Facing the threat of some outrage-free airtime, Kumia and Hughes grudgingly allow a Time Ravage stripper named Sandy Kane into their studio to perform a raunchy ballad. 
[00:23:00]  But they've...  Hey, welcome.  What the heck is that?  I was looking for this.  Are you ready?  Oh, okay.  Oh, ah!  Ow!  They're forced to bleep out several forbidden phrases, and Hughes warns,  We're going to let you try it one more time, but if we have to dump out again, we're all going to throw stuff at you.  They replayed this segment yesterday when we were taking the day off.  Yeah.  When she makes it through the number, a twisted love song for Jerry Seinfeld. 
[00:23:30]  Hughes shrugs, let's throw stuff at her anyway.  We're just idiots all the time.  But Kane freezes before the mics as all five guys in the studio begin hurling audio cassettes, half-filled bottles of water, and my favorite,  and copies of Blacktail magazine at the wall just past her head.  Sparks is frantically picking up after his bosses as an overstimulated Hughes lifts his office chair over his head and smashes it to the floor. 
[00:24:00]  We're a bunch of monkeys in here.  That's funny.  They nailed Ben, though, because Ben always is like, Oh, my God, oh, my God, and turning up after us.  Red face and sweaty with ten minutes to go.  We're just a mess.  Hughes and Kumia are about to resort to the day's second game of broad bingo when in walks Emma, a lithe, 20-year-old,  in a t-shirt, cargo pants, and Adidas shell toes.  Hey, Emma, Hughes chirps, you're hot.  Emma snaps off her leg below the knee, removes the sneaker and sock, and places it on the console. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, it's like a real leg, says Kumia, only it's not.  What bit of genius is that?  Only it's not.  It's like a real leg, only not.  Only not.  That's what I'm trying to say, really.  The guy's gaze at the limb with childlike awe.  You said there were fake toes and stuff, Kumia explains.  Complains.  Oh, complains.  Yeah, I was complaining.  Complaining because it didn't have the fake toes.  She said it was like a real foot.  That's my spare, Emma says. 
[00:25:00]  The foot flew off the other one.  It was pretty funny until I realized I couldn't walk.  Then she tells him that the car accident that cost her the lower part of her leg also left her clinically dead for several minutes.  Was there a tunnel and light and all that, Kumia asks?  If there was, I don't remember because they gave me so much morphine.  What kind of death is that, Kumia says, laughing?  You got gypped.  Well, if you're going to die for a few minutes, you might as well get the whole treatment.  I think we're doing a show for third graders.  Just the words you're using, gypped and toes and stuff. 
[00:25:30]  You know something?  When we're doing it here, it's one thing.  And then you read it.  As it happens, I'm laughing like I never did this.  Like, it's just something I'm reading.  Giggling, Emma tells them she wanted to come in and show them that she's very all right with it.  I think it's hilarious.  Hughes and Kumia couldn't agree more.  Invite her to come back on the show another day when there's more time.  I just love you guys, she coos.  Some people will say it's terrible, but you know what?  Hughes says earnestly.  Earnestly?  Did you say this earnestly?  Turn page. 
[00:26:00]  Earnestly off the air.  One-legged people have a sense of humor.  Blind people want to have fun.  We're just trying to have fun and include everyone.  They want to be involved, says Kumia.  Another brilliant quote by myself.  They want to be involved.  Just tell the truth.  It's fun to exploit them.  If you think about it.  If you think about it, really.  Those getting involved include busty catfighters, a ventriloquist whose dummy can't stop shrieking,  burn your meat curtains with a crack pipe.  Burn your meat curtains with a crack pipe, you whore. 
[00:26:30]  Get in the coffin, die.  And actor Jay Moore who offers ribald impressions and a target for jokes about his career woes.  Popular running gags include Whipin' Mount Wednesday when Opie and Anthony encouraged female fans to expose their breasts to cars with wild bumper stickers.  F.U. Friday when callers ran about everything from traffic to cheating wives.  And Cripple Bouts, a series of fights between physically challenged listeners held right inside the studio.  The name of the latter was changed from Battle Crips after the show received calls from people claiming to be upset gang members. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, that's true.  We did check it out on that one.  In between stunts, they ponder possible double entendres and Judas Priest lyrics now that former frontman Rob Halford has come out as gay.  And howl at a recording of Chris Burke, the actor with Down Syndrome, who played Corky and Life Goes On, singing a Beatles song.  If it makes people uneasy to hear someone with Down Syndrome sing, it makes them laugh when others are willing to join in.  Hughes and Kumia call it cringe radio.  There you go.  Cringe radio. 
[00:27:30]  What's this cringe radio?  Yeah, Bill O'Reilly.  Bill O'Reilly, cringe radio.  If you were a better person, you wouldn't laugh, but you're not.  And anyway, where's the beer?  Another quote from us, Anthony.  He doesn't explain this next little thing.  He goes, if there's an adult on the show, it's Hughes.  At 36, the younger of the two.  But it doesn't explain why he says that.  Kumia, 38, dominates blocks of the program with manic celebrity impressions, Mike Tyson, Regis, Captain Quinn from Jaws, as Hughes works the control panels and feeds him ideas. 
[00:28:00]  In performance mode, this is funny, Kumia constantly flicks his head around like he's searching for some invisible object.  His wiry body even seems to vibrate when he's not doing anything at all.  When he's not cackling, Hughes, who still resembles the Ron Howard character from whom he got his nickname, has two expressions, thoughtful and weary.  Thoughtful and weary.  Thoughtful and weary.  What the F?  Two expressions.  Thoughtful and weary. 
[00:28:30]  Both have serious girlfriends.  Hughes for eight years, Kumia for two, neither of whom works.  We have a very normal relationship, says Hughes.  She spends my money.  She has a great life.  Works out.  Makes me dinner.  That's my girlfriend's life.  Jesus Christ.  That's awful.  Kitchen in the bedroom, Florida.  Don't say it, James.  James!  Co-hosting a daily frat party, Ken Hughes admits, create the occasional rift in a relationship. 
[00:29:00]  She gets bothered sometimes when the chicks are in the studio, but that's an important part of doing a radio show that guys want to check out.  Kumia adds that his girlfriend loves the show.  She finds me funny.  There you go.  That said, neither Hughes nor Kumia lets his girlfriend be interviewed.  We keep them naked and gagged.  We keep in a closet out on Long Island.  Where's the part about my stupid lunch?  Where's your sandwich?  Right on the next paragraph, Dan. 
[00:29:30]  The next paragraph?  Oh, both grew up among the strip malls in 7-Elevens of Long Island.  My mom was pretty strict when I was growing up, so I never really got a chance to experiment as a teenager, says Hughes.  Munching on a ham on white sandwich his girlfriend packed him.  There's also a Ziploc bag full of grapes.  Wow, he's eating lunch.  Come on.  Ham on white?  No!  How many...  Because I'm getting killed.  I mean, I'm getting killed because of this line in this interview.  How many times do I bring lunch in a week? 
[00:30:00]  Once maybe.  Spends my money.  She has a great life.  Works out.  Makes me dinner.  And puts my sandwiches in a bag for lunch.  A little Ziploc bag full of grapes.  Doug from Springfield, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Opie Poo, what color pants did your girlfriend dress you that day with?  Yeah.  Did she bake, put some nice chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies?  Just grapes because they're healthy.  Did she make you some Nestle Quick or strawberry milk?  Oh, I didn't think it was going to be my turn today.  Take it easy, guys.  I don't want to deal with this today. 
[00:30:30]  Do you like another grape?  No, thanks.  I don't want to get fat.  I've had four grapes.  Five is over.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, Opie, man.  I don't want to wear any Twinkies in a little container of milky faggot.  Oh, milky.  Did I say this on stage at the Stone Pony?  Are you ready for some debauchery and drunken stupidity?  Kumia asks to a volley of affirming howls from a crowd of several thousand fans at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Raisins, anyone?  But Rich wants to know why Sandy doesn't pack your lunch in an old cement bag.  Wow.  He's really going back to a break of about a year ago.  Very funny.  At least I can buy little, you know, lunch bags.  Little lunch bags now, see?  Kind of neat.  You guys, that's the kind of cool thing that you guys had going on in school.  One for the sandwich and one for the grapes. 
[00:31:30]  Yay!  Dan, what's up?  Hey, Opie, I bet you can't wait until Halloween so you can go pumpkin picking with Sandy.  You tool.  Pumpkin picking.  How long ago did you go pumpkin picking?  Was it last year?  Yeah.  I think, I thought you skipped last year.  Did I skip last year?  I don't even know.  No, I probably didn't, Anthony.  Blue Nod Joe.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Opie, was your sandwich a little crunchy from some of that leftover cement mix in your lunch  bag?  That's great. 
[00:32:00]  Well, you know, they didn't mention the whole thing that sometimes that, you know, on a  Friday, if it's been a good week, she'll pack you a little pixie stick for dessert.  A pixie stick.  Thank God.  Or a crispy red apple.  Opie, is that thoughtful or weary, what I'm looking at right now?  Healthy.  Is it thoughtful or weary as you pluck another grape from your Ziploc bag?  If this goes on a little longer, it's going to be weary.  Sometimes he even throws one up and catches it with his hand.  Tony, what's up?  And laughs with regular guy confidence. 
[00:32:30]  Because I'm a regular guy that takes the train in every day.  And I do it for the listeners, God damn it.  Tony.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, listen, does your girlfriend also wrap up your soda in tin foil?  Keeps it cold.  And also, do you smuggle those grapes into the studio, thus making you a grape smuggler?  Thank you, Tony.  Take care, guys.  You suck.  All right.  Look who's on the phone.  Sandy.  Hi. 
[00:33:00]  Hey.  I just was in the car and I heard them, like, ripping on you.  It's the sandwich maker, Sandy.  It's me.  Who makes me dinner every night.  I know.  Look, the article makes me look like Susie Holmaker.  Works out, makes him dinner.  And spends my money.  And spends his money.  Which is partly what I do, but that's not all I do.  Oh, right.  But luckily...  You're working on the cure for AIDS.  We have sex every once in a while, sweets.  Yeah, that's like something you should throw in there, right?  I know, right?  Luckily, they didn't notice everything else you had that day. 
[00:33:30]  That was the day you had, like, a full, full lunch.  Yeah.  You had, like, your fruit cup and your...  I didn't have a fruit cup.  Yes, you did.  That was...  Sandy, do you cut the crusts off?  Or cut the sandwich into a heart shape?  Leave a little note, I love you.  Sandy, cut it in quarters.  What?  We haven't really been able to talk about this at home.  Yeah?  Because it's kind of embarrassing.  Yeah.  Did you really catch me the other night?  Yes, I did. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, he talked about it already?  No.  Oh, you caught him.  I did catch you, and I had to close my eyes.  Wait a minute.  He was using one of the couch cushion pillows to cover himself, but I could see what was going  on.  Could you please get some...  Because I was on the couch...  Sandy, get some folding chairs so when I come over, I have something to sit on, because  I'm not sitting on that couch.  The way our couches are set up, I could...  I was on the other couch, so I was looking towards him and towards the television. 
[00:34:30]  Wait, I don't get this.  You're in the same room.  And Opie's across from you on the couch.  Oh, you're asleep again.  I woke up.  Now, I remember when this happened previously.  What?  You were doing something.  Sandy wasn't even in the room.  You were sitting on the couch.  He's watching a porno.  Yeah, and I come in, and he throws on NASCAR.  You came in, and he shut it off real quick, but he didn't have the right channel on.  Yeah, he put it on NASCAR, which he never watched.  No, no.  It was just that I pushed stop on the porno, and the channel that popped up was NASCAR.  It was NASCAR, and Sandy knows Opie would never watch NASCAR, so she knew something 
[00:35:00]  was up, but this time, you're asleep across from him on the couch.  Yeah.  We rented a rush hour, Anthony.  Rush hour.  So I felt...  Wait a minute.  What's in rush hour that would get you so randy?  A particularly sexy kick that's thrown?  No, I was bored with the movie.  You were bored with the movie, so you figured you'd just crank one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like a goddamn monkey.  Yeah.  So you're sitting there, and what happened? 
[00:35:30]  Sandy just opened her eyes?  Well, because he couldn't see me, because his back was to me, because our couches are like  at a 90-degree angle.  Oh, so you're laying on your side, and you're facing...  No, I'm talking to Opie.  He's laying on his side.  You're facing the back.  Her head's like...  I'll show you.  No, he's on his back.  Here's a TV over here.  I'm laying down like this, and her head's like over here on the other couch.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  So you're on your back.  He's on his back.  So I take a look behind me.  I'm like, hey, she's asleep.  Where were you going to put it?  What do you mean? 
[00:36:00]  What did you have?  Did you have a Ziploc baggie on it?  The empty bag from his grave.  Oh, it's all gooey.  What were you going to do with it?  I don't know.  I just...  I don't know.  Just let it fly?  Shoot some web.  And then get...  Oh, my God.  So put it this way.  I wake up, I open my eyes, and I see his hand going.  I just closed my eyes to pretend I was still sleeping.  I wake up, and his hand is gone. 
[00:36:30]  Holy Jesus.  What'd you do?  Me?  Yeah.  She got scared.  I closed my eyes, and I just, like, closed my eyes pretending I was sleeping.  And I would, like, open them to check, and he was still doing it.  And then I said, forget.  I'll just close my eyes and just go back to sleep.  What a dysfunctional relationship this is.  Was he making any noises?  No.  Oh, no.  You didn't hear any?  No, I was...  I got embarrassed, because I didn't...  What?  Honestly, he didn't expect me to see, and I opened my eyes, so I had to pretend like  I didn't see what was going on. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, my God!  But I mentioned it to him the other day.  I said, I forgot what we were talking about.  I'm like, well, I saw you playing around the other night.  Playing around, like he's with Legos.  Oh, that's so funny.  I'm like, oh, you saw that?  And then we dropped it.  So it's good to...  Yes, I never got back to it.  So it's good we bring it up for 12 cities.  Good.  Good.  Yeah.  So I don't understand...  Wouldn't that normally set something off where you'd be having sex in a matter of minutes?  Yeah.  I would think.  Yeah, I guess, but it was just...  It scared Sandy, though.  It was... 
[00:37:30]  Well, because I woke up, and that's all I saw.  Well, you just saw, like, the...  I saw the hand going.  I thought you just saw the pillow.  No, because he had the pillow on his slant.  He was banging a pillow!  No, he was not.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, he was not.  Shut up, Rick.  Stick to the facts.  The pillow would slant it so that you couldn't see the...  I strategically...  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, I can't say that?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Was there a block of melted cheese on the couch?  The pillow was strategically set to my side so she couldn't see where it was going.  Exactly. 
[00:38:00]  Strategically.  It worked really well.  But I could see the hand going.  The hand?  Oh, you are the greatest.  The hand is going.  She closes her eyes, and he covers with a pillow.  It was just so great.  Oh, man.  I'm just eating grapes.  Man, I looked back a couple times.  I did not see you wake up.  I'll make your sandwich, but I see I won't have to use any mayonnaise supplying that yourself,  are you?  All right.  Well, thanks, Sam.  Well, you brought that one up.  I wasn't going to mention that. 
[00:38:30]  Wow.  I figured if I'm in the barrel, I might as well go the whole distance.  Shut up.  Now they've got something else to rip you on besides your little sandwich.  Thanks, Sam.  All right.  Well, have a good day.  Frank in it.  Bye.  Bye.  That's so great she called with that.  That's the third time, too.  Third time.  Oh, yeah.  Third time?  Third time.  She just keeps catching you, huh?  I think he wants to get caught.  Yeah.  Now it's sounding like one of those things where, all right, he kind of wants to get caught  now.  To cry for help.  Dan from Hoboken's checking in.  He goes, wow, Sandy took the time out of her busy workout and cooking schedule to call 
[00:39:00]  the show.  Doochback.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Opie, I thought you liked the Mets, not the Yankees.  Hey, Opie.  Forget it, the Yankees.  Did you get tired after your lunch and take a little Napsky?  A Napsky.  Lay a little mat down in the studio.  Oh.  All right.  The abuse is just over the top.  Well, what did you expect?  Anyway, so New York Magazine, Anthony, the August 20th edition. 
[00:39:30]  We're in that.  What are the looks?  Thoughtful, caught, and what else?  Weary.  Weary.  Now you know why I'm so weary.  George.  Anthony, help me.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, man.  What's happening, guys?  Hey.  Listen, I just got a question.  When Sandy changes the sheet, is it like taking a hard top off a convertible?  Opie, Dr. Buster Hyman.  Opie, with a $30 million contract, can't you afford a porno J.O. room?  Porno J.O. room.  I'm starting to think about that.  I got to move out of the treehouse first.  Yeah.  Like a monkey.  Ugh.  Hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting. 
[00:40:30]  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027, WNEW.  New York.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to this show?  Opie and Anthony.  Troopless, drunken, white trash.  Hey, guys, you're all.  1027, WNEW.  Hey, Mario Chantone is on the line. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, Mario.  Mario.  Yeah, thanks for putting me through that.  Right.  I had to hear the word faggot three times from a young a**hole urbanite.  You know what?  I'm going to tell you something.  This is the truth, too.  Yeah.  I was walking up the street one day, and I had just been given a gift, and it was a yo-yo.  It was an actual Dunkin' yo-yo.  And this, seriously, I'm playing with it on the street, and this guy goes to me, this  young kid, black kid, he was like, yo, man, is that a yo-yo? 
[00:41:30]  I said, I have been waiting for the day for you to put the word yo with yo-yo.  I've been waiting for the day.  Yo, is that a yo-yo?  Yo, is that a yo-yo?  Omar.  Hey.  A friend of mine's here.  I'm on the Opie and Anthony show as we speak right now.  So just sit down and wait.  You're with the star.  Yo-yo.  Yo-yo.  Yo-yo.  So what up, fellas?  Yo, is that a yo-yo?  Yes, it's a Dunkin' yo-yo.  Well, we just got instant feedback in.  Some guy said that you were doing an A&E buy. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, I hosted A&E biography this week.  Biography?  Yeah, it was a biography goes ape.  And it was Charlton Heston and Tim Burton.  What happened to the Mission Impossible guy?  What do you mean what happened?  Peter Graves?  Yeah.  Peter Graves took a rest that week, and it was me and my mean.  It's a good thing I didn't see the movie yet.  Have you seen the movie?  Yes.  You're killing me.  You like the Planet of the A.  Helena Bonham Carter looked like Janet Jackson. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, we said that.  She looked like Maybelline Monkey.  She looked like Revlon Chimp.  Hellacious.  Yeah, it was awful.  Awful.  What about the one that looked like Paul Abdul?  Oh, what about the one that looked like Jocelyn Wildenstein?  It was one ape that had, like, work done.  It was really weird.  It was very strange.  And I'll tell you something.  I love Tim Burton, and I was just very disappointed.  Yeah, Tim.  Well, our expectations were really high, obviously, but I don't think he got the job done. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, me too, and I thought it really sucked.  Thank you, Carmen.  I love you guys.  Carmen, did you?  Did anybody see it last night?  Oh, my God.  It was porno.  It was porno.  Mario, you should have been here today, because this is all the stuff we've been discussing all day.  No, you know, I didn't know.  With Carmen, how could we say it on the radio?  He was giving a handy to the dog.  Right.  I know.  I know.  Red racket.  Red racket.  Red racket.  Red racket.  Red racket.  Red racket.  Red racket.  And Butters is priceless in that one. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, Butters is really priceless.  Yeah, I put it on.  Red racket.  Here, listen to this.  It's all going.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the AIDS, fellas.  When he ever says the AIDS, because I do everything with that.  It's like, you know, I just saw that new show, The Tick, Tick, Boom.  The show with the guy that wrote The Rent.  The Tick, Tick, Boom.  The Rent.  The Rent.  He wrote The Rent Show.  And, you know, he died very young.  He didn't have the AIDS or the cancer, but he died very young unexpectedly.  He's got the big casino, Tony. 
[00:44:00]  He's got the tick, tick, boom.  It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  You guys.  So, children of the corn, I'm going to come back and see you.  I'm going to come back and see you soon.  Yeah.  Right now, I'm very busy making motion pictures.  What are you doing now?  I'm doing a movie called Last Request that I saw at the end of August, beginning of September.  And you know what's so funny?  I'll have to tell you the story.  Wait.  Okay. 
[00:44:30]  I was supposed to go to Amsterdam last Wednesday.  That's right.  But I couldn't because I had to film the biography thing on Saturday.  So, I changed my flight and everything.  I'm in Amsterdam at the Casa de David, which is a little Italian restaurant.  And this couple next to me, Julie and Jack.  Jack and Julie were among the girls.  So, they came up to me and they were like, the guy was a big fan of mine and he swam from your show.  Him and his wife were like, oh my God, we think you're great.  We listen to you on O&A and da-da-da.  Wow. 
[00:45:00]  So, I was very recognized in Amsterdam, ironically.  That's so cool.  Because of your show.  Nice.  In Amsterdam.  In Slamster Slam.  Now, about this biography.  What?  You were doing one on Chuck Heston.  I did one on Chuckles, yeah.  Chuck Heston.  Chucky.  Chuckles, I called him.  And people said that you were just dying over the Gladiator movie scenes that he would do.  He blows.  Don't even talk to you on it.  Let me tell you something.  My taste is a little better than Chuck Heston.  What about young Chuck Heston? 
[00:45:30]  He was all right.  He liked the mocky-mock.  Damn you.  What about young Chuck Heston?  You know, before I got old and did Soylent Green, you know, the one where I said, let my people go.  Damn you.  Damn you, Mario can't hold.  Didn't I look good in a loincloth?  You looked great in a loincloth.  You're damn tootin'.  Yeah, you did.  With that bitch on the back of my horse stealing the scene.  That point in your career when you were plowing Shelly Winters. 
[00:46:00]  Yes.  It plowed me really good.  I can't wear your loincloth.  Before she got Poseidon Adventure fat.  I can't wait for that pleasure.  Oh, wow.  I was saying before that.  Wow.  That is a great Shelly Winner.  I was saying before that.  I was doing like my roommate.  My roommate.  Wow.  Oh, I can picture her sitting next to Carson.  Oh, sheesh.  Who's in her effing mind?  Do a line from the Poseidon Adventure. 
[00:46:30]  Me?  Mrs. Peter Pan?  I'm not.  Oh, wow.  Give her to the kids.  I mean, she's swimming.  I plowed on my leading men here.  Every one of them.  Every one of them.  Every one.  Jay Francisca, Tony Francisca, Laura McCall.  Every one.  Laura McCall.  She was the prettiest one.  Even, uh, what's his name from, uh, Chico and the Man that you were in, uh...  Harold, Harold, was it? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  No, he was too skinny.  Well, it's...  Goddamn.  Marky Quinn would have probably killed him when he was gone.  Who the hell does Shirley Woods' is?  Only me.  That's right.  You boys are quite violent, Julia.  Yeah.  Um, so I'll be coming back to see you soon.  Yes, you do that.  Right.  Mario?  Yeah.  I hate to put you on the spot, but we're in a bunch of new cities right now.  You gotta do just a, just a, just a touch or a little taste of, uh, Judy Garland. 
[00:47:30]  You know, you, you, you boys really have a model show.  Like, years ago when I used to do my show.  Lorna, Lorna, could you get me those, um, the candies in the, the left drawer?  No, the, no, the blue one.  The blue, okay.  Lorna, like, Lorna, sing with me.  Lorna has a little bit of talent.  Eliza has a whole lot of talent and, uh, a good supply of suppositories for her irregularity. 
[00:48:00]  Who knew?  Who knew?  You're marvelous.  You kids are wonderful.  You really are.  You're good at it.  You're good at those early on.  She just got out of the hospital, Catherine.  Oh, you can fuck my, I'll live forever.  Fuck my, I'll live forever, you guys.  You can't say that.  My name is General Cartman.  You can't say that.  And we're going to kick ass. 
[00:48:30]  You can't say that.  And we're fighting for the glorious ass.  That was one of the best episodes.  It is one of the best ones.  The, uh, Civil War one.  It is.  General Cartman.  We gotta talk about Mariah Carey in a little bit.  Oh!  I thought you might have something on that.  Do you think she's having a breakdown now?  Wait till the movie comes out.  Wait till the winter comes out.  She will flash it all.  Yeah, it seems she completely lost her mind.  Yeah, you would.  And started breaking stuff.  Her mother had to call 911.  Yeah.  How much would you have paid to be in the room watching her lose her mind?  I'd give anything.  Wouldn't you?  I'd give anything.  Right at that moment where she's screaming. 
[00:49:00]  You know how she sings.  So the screams are probably like...  Huge.  Huge.  That high-pitched screech she can do.  Oh, I would love to have been there, though, and just watch her lose it.  I would have, too.  Crying, pulling her hair out.  Sonny McCullough, you son of a bitch!  You ruined me!  Well, you know, when Glitter comes out, I'm going to have about ten minutes new material,  I'm sure.  Yeah.  I can't f*** away.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Wait, wait, wait.  You can beat me! 
[00:49:30]  I'm sorry, America.  All right, Mary.  I apologize, America.  My children of the corn.  If you ever get the chance to see Mario Cansone, run.  Yes.  All right?  All right, Mario.  You're brilliant and funny, and you give me, you give Miss Crawford the respect I'm entitled  to.  That I would get from any fan on the street!  You literally embarrassed me in front of a reporter! 
[00:50:00]  It's Barbara Bennett from Red Book, Christina.  I want you to behave.  Oh, Christina, I'd like to see you, please, in the other room.  No one's messed up about Mario, and we brought this up.  Oh, that's great.  He does the Joan Crawford.  And Faye Dunaway.  And then he does the Faye Dunaway.  Yeah, I do them both.  Yes.  Can we hear the original one?  All right, the original Joan Crawford.  Well, that was Faye Dunaway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could I see you, please?  And the real Joan Crawford is like this.  When I'm on a set, I want my set at 58 degrees. 
[00:50:30]  If it isn't at 58 degrees, I leave.  And at the end of the day, if it's a good one, I turn to the crew and I say, bless you.  Bless you all.  Miss Crawford!  Then we did the Betty Davis after the stroke, which is my favorite impression in the world.  I could do that all day and just channel it.  All day.  Miss Crawford, really.  You know, she was a bitch.  Her breasts were a different size every day during the filming of Baby Jane Hudson, which I was robbed of the Oscar. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, so.  Robbed of the Oscar.  Yes, Miss Crawford campaigned against me.  She went to everyone and said, if you don't win, please let me accept.  Well, Miss Bancroft won, and she swept by me, clutching the Oscar to her breast as if it were her own.  I love the post-stroke.  She's horrible.  The book was true.  Oh, man.  Of course, the book my daughter wrote about me was totally and utterly untrue.  And it broke my heart. 
[00:51:30]  It was worse than the stroke.  It really was.  And Marriott, the Shelley winners.  That's great.  Goodbye, boys.  I have to take a swim.  All right.  Goodbye.  Bye.  I think I called her Shirley Winters, but okay.  Hellie Winters.  Holy Jesus.  He does all those old star women when they're past their prime.  This is very cool.  Who the hell does Shelley Winters impression?  The post-stroke Betty Davis is the best one. 
[00:52:00]  You can do the before-stroke, but it's not as fun as when she's slurring her words and drooling out of the side of her mouth.  Remember when you used to see her, like, on Dick Carson?  On a Merv or something.  Yeah.  Or Johnny Carson.  Yeah.  She'd come out.  And that lip is sagging and drool is coming off her.  You're like, ah.  She's Hollywood legend.  Hollywood legend.  Anyway.  I'm a legend.  Yeah.  I think we have to take another break, huh?  Here you go.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  There's a good example of poor programming.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:52:30]  Once again, no clue.  We have no idea what we're doing today.  It's a...  Let's just smorgasbord.  Let's just be honest with ourselves.  We really don't know what's going to happen on any given day.  Not a clue.  Some days we can pull it out of our ass.  And other days, well...  We blow monkey ass.  We're like the Titanic.  But, well, we did a lot of show prep today in the back office coddling Earl. 
[00:53:00]  Making sure he's okay with the world.  Yeah, we did.  How did that meeting go?  I was in the office, but I was busy playing Soldier of Fortune.  While you guys are having an in-depth meeting with Earl.  See, I get a bad rap on this show, man.  Everyone thinks I'm, you know, inhuman and out of my freaking mind.  Uh-huh.  Who was the one, like, you know, cuddling Earl in the back office?  Matt Devote came to us.  Who was the one that allowed Earl to suckle on his breast? 
[00:53:30]  Opie.  Thank you.  Matt Devote came in.  You uncaring son of a bitch.  I can't help it.  I was in the middle of a very tough level.  Couldn't get off your Soldier of Fortune game for two minutes to talk to a guy that's been a little sad about the abuse he's been taking on our radio show lately.  Like I cared?  You see the shot I made?  Oh, my God.  Psycho Mark almost creamed.  It was hysterical.  There was a guy.  He's standing behind a brick wall.  I edged out with my sniper rifle.  I zoomed way in.  I picked his toe off. 
[00:54:00]  He starts jumping around, grabbing his foot, bleeding.  And it exposed enough of his skull when I picked his head off in two shots.  It was like, bam foot, bam head.  The guy just fell down on the table.  And just sprayed blood all over the back wall.  Oh, it was hysterical.  There's Earl, like, being coddled because of his stress that he's having with this program.  Mm-hmm.  And me and Psycho Mark are laughing our balls off because some guy just whacked a guy on the Soldier of Fortune game.  Well, we got some ideas about Earl.  I'm the invisible man. 
[00:54:30]  God damn.  I went to sleep last night chuckling.  With Earl and the invisible man?  Yeah.  Yes.  I'm the invisible man.  Stop that.  The invisible man.  All right, where's Earl?  It's time for his decision.  Yeah, we gave him a choice yesterday.  He was having such trouble with the program yesterday, feeling that he was the brunt of a lot of our abuse yesterday. 
[00:55:00]  And we gave him a choice because he was getting all cranky.  He wouldn't come on the phone.  He'd hang up on us in the middle of our conversation with him.  And we gave him a choice yesterday.  Told him to think about it overnight.  Do you want to be part of this program?  Do you want to leave this program?  Right.  It's a final decision.  If he chooses to be on this program, he will be on this program, I guess.  Well, and I discussed some options today at lunch.  Earl's in the studio.  Hey, Earl.  How you doing?  Did the meeting make you feel better? 
[00:55:30]  I hope you weren't upset that I was playing Soldier of Fortune during the entire meeting.  I wouldn't expect anything.  The entire meeting.  Did you see that shot I took of the guy's foot?  It was great.  Earl, I showed some sensitivity in the back office today, right?  Yeah.  Surprisingly.  Very cool.  Yeah, I'm very cool.  Off air.  Now did that.  Yeah, off air.  We switched roles off air.  It's the bastard.  I just have things to do.  I don't care about anything.  I'm very busy.  And I'm the one that keeps everybody happy, I guess.  And I just had a very busy. 
[00:56:00]  I had things to do.  I'm on the final levels, Opie.  So, Earl, you've taken some hits lately on the show.  A lot of abuse about the Invisible Man.  A lot of abuse about your new nickname.  So, everyone is wondering, do you want to still be a part of the O&A show?  Yes, I do.  Oh!  Oh, there's a surprising, uh...  There's a surprising answer.  Is there any buts?  Buts, eh.  Because you can't be part of the O&A show, but... 
[00:56:30]  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Stop that.  So, are you okay with this program?  Yeah.  You're okay with, uh...  With, uh...  Your appearances on this program?  The way you're treated on this program?  There are certain points when I'm like, don't put this on the air.  And that's not your fault.  It's more Spaz's fault.  What?  How is Spaz getting home? 
[00:57:00]  No, like, when I call...  When I'll call in, I'll say, God...  With something absolutely...  That has nothing to do with the show, I'll say, don't...  This is not for air.  We were well aware of the stuff you didn't want on the air.  That makes it better to bring up on the air.  Earl, the stuff you didn't want on the air was, uh...  The friend...  Allegedly...  That was in the, uh...  Studio.  That was it.  But you mentioned it during your shift.  That somebody was in the studio.  So that's why we said, well, who was that?  I'm the invisible man. 
[00:57:30]  And we went on to say that there wasn't anybody in the studio.  And then it gave us two hours of hilarious radio yesterday.  Hilarity.  We know who was in the studio.  We know.  I'm the invisible man.  And I think it's time to expose it.  Earl, it was the great kazoo, wasn't it?  From the Flintstones.  Remember that from the Flintstones?  Only Fred and Barney could see them?  Hey, that was the great kazoo. 
[00:58:00]  Where is he?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hello, dum-dums.  Well, Earl Douglas.  I'll get Fred and Barney, we'll go bowling.  I don't like being referred to as the invisible man.  All right.  Kazoo.  Hey, kazoo.  Or we could write you off. 
[00:58:30]  No, great kazoo.  Well, dum-dums.  Yes.  Earl.  Earl, so you still want to be part of the show?  Sure.  Definitely.  Ant and I are not really sure that you're capable of handling the abuse that we throw at you.  Yes, some people can choose to want to do something, but then other people can see that maybe they're not into it.  You know how the cops have to take a stress test and stuff like that, a psychological evaluation? 
[00:59:00]  The guy might want to be a cop really bad, but the people in charge might see that maybe he can't handle it.  And it's in his best interest that he not be a cop.  Well, maybe it's in your best interest that even though you want to be part of the program, that you're not part of the program anymore.  You seem a little unstable.  A little wrapped, a little too tight.  That could be true.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So we're thinking of a scenario here.  Yeah, some way where maybe everyone will be happy here. 
[00:59:30]  We're thinking of killing you off.  You ever see how they do that on TV?  Not literally, but...  No, in the sitcom sense.  You ever see how they do that all the time?  They kill off a character?  You've been a part of the O&A show for almost two years.  Right from the beginning, one of the initial characters.  And we're thinking of...  You are part...  Like if it was like Happy Days, you would be like the Richie, Potsy, Ralph Mouth. 
[01:00:00]  No, he obviously would be Sticks.  Sticks.  The only black guy in Happy Days.  Hey, reference of the day yet?  Very good.  I got to give you a reference of the day.  All right.  But as far as the people that were on the show right from the start, you know how that was.  Richie, Potsy, Ralph, Fonz, you know, all there.  Got to be Chuck.  Chuck.  Well, Chuck was there from the beginning, but you saw what happened with Chuck. 
[01:00:30]  There's a good example.  He just came up with one.  Yeah.  Chuck.  Chuck.  Chuck just disappeared off of Happy Days.  The brother.  I guess what Ann's trying to say is we're going to write you off the show, so we just need a scenario.  Like, do you just disappear like Chuck did?  Maybe he just disappears and no one ever talks about him again.  Right.  You just walk off with the basketball and then never to return.  Pull like a, maybe like a Chrissy Snow off of Three's Company where all of a sudden you leave and sometimes they get a phone call from Chrissy. 
[01:01:00]  You ever see that?  But you never hear Chrissy's voice.  You never see her face.  But the other one's on the phone and she's talking.  She goes, hangs up and goes, Jack, that was Chrissy.  She says hi.  You know, but there's never any voice of Chrissy or anything.  Or Mrs. Cunningham.  Yeah, Mrs. Cunningham.  Oh, Chuck just called.  You never see Chuck.  You never hear his voice.  They just refer to him on the phone.  Maybe occasionally we can get up and go, hey, look, Earl was on the phone.  We just talked to him. 
[01:01:30]  So, so we want to write your, your end, your ending to the Opie and Anthony show.  Maybe we could start telling our listeners that, that black girl got another job at a, at a radio station in Seattle.  In Seattle.  And then when they see you on the streets of New York, they could go, hey, Earl, you're back for the weekend.  How's Seattle?  Yeah.  Like Frasier.  Right.  You know, Frasier after Cheers, he went to Seattle and did his little psychology show on the radio.  Now, Earl, if I was the one going to be killed off from the ONA show, I would want to go out in a blaze of glory. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be great?  I think we all could remember one that was just a dramatic ending to a character, Earl.  Yeah.  Let me give you an example here.  Oh.  Remember, remember, Earl?  Henry Blake.  Let's have a chopper. 
[01:02:30]  Isn't it a chopper, though?  Yeah, but I believe it was an airplane that went down.  All right.  Yeah.  Who can forget?  Who can forget Radar O'Reilly walking in, walking into the operating room and announcing to everybody that Henry Blake's plane crashed, spun in.  There were no survivors.  Remember?  Henry in his little zoot suit saying goodbye. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, so sad.  Maybe we could have that.  Spaz can come in or something in the middle of the show.  Just interrupt the show.  Yeah, hold on.  Let me get the music.  So we could say goodbye to you, and it seems like it's a happy ending.  You walk down the hall with your bags packed.  You're going home.  Yeah.  All right?  And then we forget about you, and then like an hour or two later, we'll be in the middle of a funny bid or something.  Right.  And then all of a sudden...  We'll be talking.  All of a sudden, Spaz walks into the studio.  Yeah, we'll be like...  Right, Opie?  Yeah.  Farts are funny. 
[01:03:30]  Another fart joke.  Farting is funny.  Farts are funny.  Guys, guys, guys, um, at five o'clock this afternoon, Earl Douglas' chopper took off from the west side heliport and crashed into the Hudson River.  There were no survivors.  And then we can continue to do our show with our eyes all welled up with tears. 
[01:04:00]  Right, Earl?  How about that ending?  That was a good one for, uh, Henry Blake.  But your memory can live on through the invisible man, because we're keeping him.  I think he's the new character, because you've got to always have new characters coming into your sitcom.  Right. 
[01:04:30]  If you write one off, a new one has to come in.  Sure.  It serves a lot of purposes.  It allows the person that's being written off to pursue other things.  It makes a star out of the new guy, and it is a guaranteed ratings grabber.  When they write off people on a show.  ER, remember that?  What was her name?  Um, which one?  The one, I think it was Noah Wiley's character and the girl.  When the homicidal maniac cut him up, and she died?  Yeah.  I don't watch ER.  I watched that one. 
[01:05:00]  Yes.  But they wrote off, and maybe we'll have that.  Maybe we'll have a homicidal maniac who gets through the tough, rigorous security here at WNW.  Come in and just hack Earl to pieces.  So there's a lot of scenarios here.  You can leave the show, but we always leave the door open like you can return, and every  once in a while we just check in with you with a one-sided conversation with a phone  or something.  On the phone, where we don't see you or hear you, but we refer to you on the phone.  All of a sudden, out of commercials, they'll go, hey, Ant, you know who that was?  It was Earl.  That was Earl, checking in from Seattle. 
[01:05:30]  He just called.  He's doing great with his new radio job out there.  Remember?  Or we could just get someone that could handle the Black Earl abuse, and we just change Black  Earls in the middle of the season and just make believe it's the same guy.  Obviously, the best-known one of that, Darren Stevens.  Sure.  When they exchanged Dick York for a Dick Sergeant.  They switched dicks right in the middle of the season.  No one knew.  So I think that's an option.  Or a lot of people are saying the Seinfeld thing.  Remember that? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, where you're just a wrestler.  Or George's wife-to-be when she was licking the envelopes.  Earl could be licking the envelopes for the wow stickers and get poisoned and kill them  off that way in sort of a comedic Seinfeld fashion.  Hey, what happened to Black Earl?  Right.  Now everyone's coming up with suggestions, Anthony.  Let's see what Charlie thinks Earl's end should be.  What's up, Charlie?  How's it going?  Good.  Brian Song.  Let him get cancer.  And you guys keep going on for like a week or two, you know, as his condition gets, you 
[01:06:30]  know, as it worsens.  Should we give him a, that's another thing too, a disease.  A disease.  So we give him a disease and we milk it for like a week.  Yeah.  And you play the song every time.  Yeah, we slowly fade you out, Earl.  And then, you know, you have a dramatic ending where you have to say goodbye to everyone.  Oh, that's a good one.  And, like, one of you guys can give a speech every, you know, to the listening audience  every, like, every couple of days.  And in the background, you play that song that every time, you know, Brian Piccolo was 
[01:07:00]  in, you know, dying.  Yeah.  And we all could cry.  What was that song?  God, does anyone remember that?  Was it called Brian's Song?  It was Brian's Song.  Yeah.  Oh, if we could only get Brian's Song.  Try to get that.  Yeah, that's a good scenario.  That is a good one.  Oh, this is a good one.  Paul from Lawrence checking in.  The famous dream sequence.  We wake up or someone wakes up and Earl was never there.  Or Earl wakes from a dream and there's no radio show.  I like the Bob Newhart, the second show. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  Where he wakes up and his old haggard wife is in bed with him.  Or Dallas.  Remember that one?  Oh.  Oh, well, I had the weirdest dream.  I was a character on the Opie and Anthony show.  But everyone knows N.E.W. is the Rock of New York and I have to go help Scotzo today.  What a strange, strange turn of events that dream was. 
[01:08:00]  Hmm.  I wonder what Opie and Anthony, that's the weirdest thing.  Everyone knows this is the Rock of New York.  I had a dream.  You were there.  And you.  And you.  Yeah, we can put you in pigtails and have you on a bed.  And we'll have Spaz and Ant-N-I and Rick and Psycho Mark and Ben all around the bed.  I could be...  Telling you it was a bad dream.  The Cowardly Lion.  And then we could have, like, I could be the Scarecrow or something.  Or Opie could be the Tin Man.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Right.  T.J., what's up? 
[01:08:30]  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  I think you should do, like, a Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Who Shot Black Earl?  Or you could be, yeah, mysteriously shot.  And then with...  Because then that'll help us with our storyline of our show.  Then everyone has to figure out who shot Earl.  And then with the Mr. Burns, I was like, the obvious choice was Homer.  With this, the obvious choice would probably be Psycho Mark.  Right.  Always running around doing the AK.  So you could just tease that alone for a couple weeks.  That's brilliant, man.  God, that'd be great.  Who Shot Earl Douglas? 
[01:09:00]  Oh, that's a good one.  What?  Oh, Scooby-Doo ending.  Where we rip off Earl's mask and it's our old boss.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I'd have got away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids.  Where's my ice cream cone?  The Scooby-Doo ending.  We should do the Scooby-Doo ending.  The Scooby-Doo ending.  God, that would be great. 
[01:09:30]  Hey, hey, you got me, guys.  I'm back.  Oh, my God.  It's you.  We didn't expect it to be him.  He was posing as Earl to try to change the format another time.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we rip it off and it's the old promotion guy. 
[01:10:00]  Hello.  I was posing as Earl to get another satellite dish.  Oh, if it wasn't for you meddling kids in Scooby-Doo,  I'd have gotten away with a DSL system.  Hey, Scooby!  Yeah.  How are you?  Ponderous.  Hi.  I'm Shaggy. 
[01:10:30]  Effing ponderous.  Yeah, Casey Cason was Shaggy.  The voice of Shaggy-Doo.  A little dog named Scooby-Doo.  Andy, what's up?  What you could do is send Earl into the woods to film a documentary about wow.  And you could call it the Black Witch Project.  Or the Black Bitch Project, because he whines so much.  I shouldn't have come here.  I'm Ben!  Ben!  I'm sorry about wow, guys.  Right.  I should have sent more stickers. 
[01:11:00]  I love you, Mom.  What is this?  This pile of self-dressed stamped envelopes in front of the tent!  You were there this morning.  There's three piles all around my tent.  Big shot of him with snot running out his nose and eyes watering up.  Better use a wide-angle lens.  Oh!  Oh, my gosh!  That is awful! 
[01:11:30]  All right, Andy.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Well, we're coming up with some great ways to write you off.  Oh, the listener is just coming up with a bunch of them.  Have Earl go downstairs and reach for his wallet and get shot 40 times.  Oh, my God.  That's not funny.  That's terrible.  I'm just reading them as I sees them.  Yeah.  Like the Sixth Sense, Earl was white the whole movie.  Oh, my God. 
[01:12:00]  Well, well.  How about like Delman Louise where he gets in the van?  Oh, he gets in the wow van and drives off a cliff?  Yeah, Earl.  How do you want to go out?  Yeah, maybe we could just...  Do you want to go out in a blaze of glory or you want to leave the door open where you might come back?  Big Yankee fan.  You could get prostate cancer.  We could kill you off every week like they do Kenny on South Park.  Oh, that's a good idea, too.  You kill Black Earl.  You bastard. 
[01:12:30]  You bastards.  There's so many ways we could get rid of you.  I think he's got to go out like MASH, though, with Spaz coming in and making the announcement.  Making an announcement with the touching departure instead of the wacky comedy departure.  Yeah, like he leaves, there's the memories, we're all happy, we're happy he's going home, we're happy he's going to something he's going to enjoy a little better than the abuse of this program.  Right.  And then Spaz comes in and announces.  Then just a tragic twist of this.  His chopper went down. 
[01:13:00]  His chopper went down.  You could see, like, as he's leaving, Spaz could be all teary and salute him as Black Earl walks to the elevators.  Right.  And then walks down in the streets of New York and waits three hours for a cab that never shows up.  And the camera just slowly fades all the way back, but you still see Earl trying to get that cab.  But you just know inside, Annie's going to be okay and he's going to eventually get that cab. 
[01:13:30]  Taking off.  For some reason, he's in a helicopter.  I have no clue why.  Where is he going in the helicopter?  Back to Forest Hills.  Back to Forest Hills.  Right, because he can't drive.  And his new life.  His new life in Forest Hills.  And all of a sudden.  Oh, my God.  His chopper went down.  There were no survivors. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, but Spaz actually reports it laughing because he hates Black people.  As you hear Black Earl crash.  Stupid.  So we'll think of something, Earl.  All right, Ant.  We've got to take a break, but Earl, thank you.  We'll figure this out and come up with a very dramatic...  Your time is limited on this show.  When's the big 3-0 coming up, Earl?  28th.  28th.  That's kind of one of those little milestones.  Wow.  Little hurdle.  I said we write him off the show on his 30th birthday. 
[01:14:30]  30th birthday.  That's going to be a tough pill to swallow.  May 28th.  Turning 30 and you're written off the hottest radio show in New York.  Yeah.  I think that's a Sunday, though.  It's a Sunday, yeah.  Yeah.  We'll work Sunday.  We'll write you off on your 30th birthday.  Oh, my God.  Happy birthday, Earl.  All right.  Well, the title of the episode, Happy Birthday Goodbye.  A very special episode of Opie and Anthony.  Goodbye, old friend.  Goodbye, Black Earl. 
[01:15:00]  All right, Ant.  Let's take a break, okay?  All right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:15:30]  All right, what do we got on the Olsen twins?  Oh, my God.  This news just coming in.  The Olsen twins making a movie.  That doesn't sound very big, does it?  Who cares?  They've put a lot of these movies out that show them as the little prepubescent little kids roaming around, 
[01:16:00]  doing little mystery things.  Very kid-like.  Opie, finally, the dramatic debut of the Olsen twins.  Fifteen years old now.  They've gotten their collective boobies together,  and they want to do something more serious, is what it says.  Ha, ha.  After a night of brainstorming and pillow fights with friends,  this is what it says.  This comes from NewsRec.com.  This is breaking news.  Yeah.  Okay.  They decided on a topic that's been in the news lately. 
[01:16:30]  There's been lots of stuff lately about Jenna Bush, the president's daughter.  The press has been saying she's drinking beer, smoking butts,  but she's just a girl like me and Ashley.  I'm reading here, Opie.  I'm not saying she's just a girl like me, Anthony, and Ashley.  I understand.  That would be Mary-Kate and Ashley.  And maybe she has a lot of pressure and stuff because her dad is the president,  says Mary-Kate, the genius out of the two,  who will portray the reportedly out-of-control Jenna Bush. 
[01:17:00]  Now, I said Mary-Kate was the press, and Ashley was the goer.  Yeah, that's what you said in Time Magazine.  Well, wouldn't you guess?  My big quote in Time Magazine is that the Olsen twins are getting very hot.  Mary-Kate's the press.  Ashley's the goer.  Is the goer.  Now, they're casting Mary-Kate as the out-of-control Jenna Bush,  and Ashley is going to be her sister.  It's going to be called Pardon Me, Daddy.  Sounds like a great title for a porno movie, too, doesn't it? 
[01:17:30]  Pardon Me, Daddy.  They've been filming for three weeks, and it's almost done, said Ashley,  who will share screen time with her twin as Jenna's sister, Barbara.  The focus will be on Jenna from her point of view  and what it's like to be in college when your dad is the president and stuff.  Yeah, we can all relate to that.  And stuff.  And stuff.  Yeah.  I remember.  Oh, here's the hottest thing.  Guys, guys, pull your junk out right now.  I'll give you a little time before you picture this in your head.  Get some lube, whatever you want to use, to crank out a batch. 
[01:18:00]  I remember one day when Mary-Kate was doing a real important scene  when she's feeling really overwhelmed  and she's crying and drinking a beer in the shower  because she's so stressed out.  Thank you.  Hot.  There's no dialogue.  There's no dialogue.  It was so powerful.  I cried.  This is Ashley talking.  I just wanted to get in the shower with her and hug her  like we do at home sometimes.  Thank you. 
[01:18:30]  Thank you.  Good night.  Thank you.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Yes.  Man.  Mary-Kate and Ashley go in the shower and hug?  Wait, Scott has a...  Where the hell's that coming from?  Scott has a slight problem here.  Scott, what's the matter?  Yo, what's up, man?  What's the deal, man?  You know, you'll have this information out.  I've been listening for an hour.  Yeah.  You hear about this big old information here.  Yeah.  I thought they were going to make a porno flick or something.  Dude, this is a prelude to porno.  Come on. 
[01:19:00]  Did you just hear Anthony?  She sometimes gets in the shower with her sister.  You know, you don't go from, you know, Mary-Kate and Ashley in Paris with their mystery movie  or Our Lips Are Sealed, which does sound like a porno movie.  You don't go from that into smut.  They're 15 already.  They're doing shower scenes.  15, they're doing shower scenes, Opie.  Did you hear me?  15, they're doing shower scenes.  Yes, I did.  And they hug in the shower at home.  Did I mention that?  Yes.  The hugging, Mary-Kate and Ashley hugging in the shower at home. 
[01:19:30]  I'm assuming they would be naked if a shower's involved, right?  Where's the internet camera there?  Drinking a beer.  We have a new Olsen twins song.  We love playing the new Olsen twins songs.  Yes, because we truly believe deep down they're very dirty girls.  Pardon Me, Daddy is scheduled to air sometime in September.  And Bob Saget is, I guess, producing it. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, he's the director.  Brief scene as President George Bush.  That's not the Bush I want to see in this movie.  And Bea Arthur is going to be Grandma Bush.  Grandma Bush.  Bea Arthur.  Who cares?  Olsen twins in the shower.  Enough.  All right.  Come on.  What's that, Rick?  My favorite scene is Ashley.  Yeah, what's the favorite scene again?  Barbara.  Uh-huh.  Barbara.  She comes to visit me in college and we're at a frat party.  After about eight beers each, we're sitting outside alone talking about how hard life is 
[01:20:30]  and how much we love each other and that we would do anything for each other.  Anything?  Anything?  Even though we were acting, it was great because we're sisters in real life and it was like  really true and stuff.  Having a twin sister is really fun.  Like really true and stuff.  And junk.  Yeah, and having a twin sister is really fun.  Pardon me, daddy.  Who's not looking forward to pardon me, daddy?  And Bob Saget. 
[01:21:00]  Don't become Bob Faggot and leave that on the cutting room floor.  And put out a video of the stuff you did cut out.  Olsen Twins, less than three years away from a legitimate threesome legal with the Olsen  Twins thing.  Depends what state you're in, my friend.  It could be as soon as what?  Next year.  Could be.  You want to hear the Lady Solsen Twins song?  Yeah, which one is this?  They love talking about sex.  Oh, really?  And singing about sex.  Yeah.  Check this out.  A little piece.  B-U-T-T out. 
[01:21:30]  B-U-T-T out.  Turn your tiny frame about.  And B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out.  Yeah.  You better not cry.  You better not bow.  You better just turn your butt about.  B-U-T-T out.  Wow.  That's an anal song.  Yeah.  You like that, don't you, bitch?  Do we have some audio from the movie? 
[01:22:00]  Really?  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Phil, watch that.  Hey, could you say that story again a little slower in like a little girly voice now?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's nice.  We ought to just go on the street and get some kid to tell us that story.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, shut up.  Well, Rachel's here.  Yeah?  Have her tell the story.  Get Rachel in here.  Where is she?  Let's see if it sounds hotter with Rachel reading the scene.  Oh, we have some sound effects from one of the frat parties in the movie? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Do you want me to read the whole quote or what did you want me to, where did you want me  to speak?  Oh, right from, I remember one day, right there.  You see that?  You got to sound like a little younger.  Like Mary-Kate and Ashley.  A little younger.  Hey, thanks.  Hold on.  Let me get ready.  Okay.  All right.  This is one of the scenes from a movie they're filming.  Go ahead, Rachel.  I remember one day when Mary-Kate was doing a really important scene when she was feeling 
[01:23:00]  really overwhelmed and she's crying and drinking a beer in the shower because she's so stressed  out.  There's no dialogue.  It was so powerful.  I cried.  I just wanted to get in the shower with her and hug her like we do at home sometimes.  Like we do at home sometimes.  Like we do at home.  Oh, my God.  How about that?  Whew.  Nice.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, the other scene? 
[01:23:30]  Okay, sure.  Who knew that was going on in the Olsen household?  And we were at a frat party.  After about eight beers each, we were sitting outside alone talking about how hard life is  and how much we love each other and that we would do anything for each other.  Even though we were acting, it was great because we're sisters in real life.  And it was like really true and stuff.  Having a twin sister is really fun.  She was a whore. 
[01:24:00]  Can we play Brother Joe songs?  Yeah, where are those?  They're good.  Anthony's brother Joe.  A couple of ditties.  One about the Bush twins and one about the Olsen twins.  Yeah, how about that?  Both done to the same exact song.  The Patty Duke theme.  The Patty Duke theme from the old Patty Duke show.  B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out.  Turn your tiny frame about and B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out. 
[01:24:30]  B-U-T-T out.  B-U-T-T out.  You better not cry.  You better not go out.  You better just turn your butt about and B-U-T-T out.  This is the Olsen twins song, Anthony, by Brother Joe.  Here's Mary Kate.  She likes Disney flicks and Barbie dolls and pogo sticks.  But Ashley is a little slut.  She likes her loving in the...  Loves them porno flicks.  They're the Olsen. 
[01:25:00]  Adolescent vixens all the way.  They will give up their high mans.  There's some lucky guy one day.  While Mary Kate likes to play knock-knock and hide and seek and sing a lot.  Well, Ashley is the one that goes so glad they take off all the clothes for the money shot.  Right there, the Olsen's.  Identical vixens and you'll find. 
[01:25:30]  They laugh alike.  They laugh alike.  I bet they'll even f*** alike.  And you know they'll be tight.  The Olsen's.  Take them from the eyes.  There you have it.  Brother Joe's song.  My God.  A lot of reports coming in that Rick has handed us a fake news story from Newsrec.com.  Rick goes, that was fake?  I know. 
[01:26:00]  Duh!  Of course it is.  Newsrec's like The Onion.  You know what The Onion is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like a fake news story.  But it's funny.  But, you know, don't look for the Olsen twins in that movie.  Well, that means they don't shower together either, Anthony.  Well, no, they do that.  Stop.  Don't ever say they don't shower at home.  Well, the whole story is fake.  Come on.  It was a thrill for a couple of minutes.  Rick was great.  It's fake? 
[01:26:30]  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie.  I'm the sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the a-hole over there.  The Opie and Anthony show.  O-W-N-N-D-E-E-W.  Jay, Marco.  Oh, I'm wet because I just got out of the shower.  Oh, God.  Please stop it.  You ass.  Stop it.  Oh, you're a bad boy. 
[01:27:00]  That was so not a turn-on.  For you, maybe.  So what's going on?  How was Provincetown?  Provincetown was delicious.  Should tell everyone Provincetown, the gay capital of Massachusetts.  The gay vacation capital of Massachusetts.  It's a beach community up there in New England, and that's where all the gays go for the summer.  For every 100 people there, 99 are gay and one is straight. 
[01:27:30]  Really?  Oh, it's like total, total, everybody's gay.  And you can see because tourists still come to visit it, and you can tell, you know, they're  walking around these little families, and they're, like, shocked.  Why?  What's going on that might shock a family gay market?  Well, you know, guys walking down the street in drag and in dresses and...  Do you like the flamboyant fags, Marco?  No, ew, no.  You don't like the guys in drag or nothing like that?  No, ew.  Friggin' fag. 
[01:28:00]  You want to make out or something?  What kind of gay guys do you like there, Marco?  I'm like Rick.  Like Rick?  Oh, what kind of gay guys?  So you like the muscle gays?  Yeah.  All right, calm down.  Look, he's all whipped up into a frost.  So what did you do this weekend in P-Town?  So I went with my friend Bucky, and I drove up to P-Town, and...  Wait, you have a friend named Bucky?  Bucky.  Bucky?  Bucky, yes. 
[01:28:30]  Is he a gay guy, too?  No.  Of course he is.  He's blind.  He's really...  But actually, we're ex-friends after this weekend.  Why?  Because we had to share a room together, and we had a limit that you had to be out with  your partner by 1 o'clock, and I could...  Door chain.  I couldn't get in.  I was so pissed.  Wait, he was inside the room with a gay guy, and you couldn't get in?  He was inside the room with two guys. 
[01:29:00]  Two guys?  Yes.  And?  And I couldn't get in.  Two gay guys, man.  So I had to go down to the pizza place and hang out.  I was pissed.  No, not the pizza place we talked about.  Oh, it's horrible.  The pizza place is where you go when you weren't lucky during the night, right?  Exactly.  Now, what happens is, if you go out to the clubs, and you don't get picked up, then you  go to the pizza place, because the bars close at 1 o'clock.  So everybody goes to the pizza place to hang out.  So I had to go to the pizza place.  I was so embarrassed. 
[01:29:30]  Did you finally find a gay man, Mark?  But let me tell you, I met the most dreamy gay man.  Oh, my God.  His name is Greg, and he's from Salem, Massachusetts.  And he totally bewitched me.  He is so gay.  He is so dreamy.  Now, okay, tell us about your date.  We met at the beach.  Well, first of all, we got there on Thursday night, and we checked into our little guest  house.  Howdy, faggot. 
[01:30:00]  It's a lovely, lovely guest house.  It was called the Copper Fox, and it's owned by a gay man, and it's so beautifully  decorated.  And so the first day we got up, and we had a little breakfast.  They said, serve you breakfast at the house.  And then we went to the beach, and we're laying on the beach.  And I look up, and there was this, like, gorgeous man sitting, like, a few feet away from me.  This is so not hot.  I know.  Oh, my God.  Don't worry.  We'll play another track from Sexy Voices in a minute here to get the bad taste out of 
[01:30:30]  our mouths.  Don't put it that way, Opie.  Please.  Never put it that way.  But, I mean, now I know what Marco's thinking when we have girls in here, and they're discussing  their sexual exploits.  Exactly.  All of a sudden, I know what Marco is thinking when he hears those girls' stories.  Totally disinterested.  And disgusted.  All right.  Continue.  So, well, I didn't talk to him because I was, like, so embarrassed.  Because he was wearing this, like, little thong bathing suit and, like, nothing to the 
[01:31:00]  imagination.  But his body was absolutely perfect.  So we went to the beach.  We wanted to have some little lunch.  And then Bucky wanted to do some antiquing.  And that's what I call...  Antiquing.  No, no, no.  It's just the gayest thing you guys do.  No.  I call it antiquing.  See, he likes old men.  So I call it antiquing.  Oh, it's called antiquing when you go trolling for old men?  Yeah.  He likes old men with lots of money.  So I call it antiquing.  Where their yam bag is hanging down below their knees? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  And their hiney cheeks are, like, hanging like flat pancakes.  Wow, that's hot, Marco.  It's not.  Saggy man ass.  But he likes them old because the old ones always buy them lots of gifts.  So...  What a way to spend your weekend.  Saggy man ass.  Nothing sadder than old gay men, Marco.  Well, then they fall asleep by 8 o'clock and then he goes out and he finds the young ones. 
[01:32:00]  And you call me after a tramp.  Yeah, baby.  So I did a little shopping because they've got the little boutiques around there.  Did you do anything manly?  Yeah, what was the manliest thing you did this weekend?  Um...  Oh, I was well-watching.  You can only imagine what that means in the gay community.  He was searching for Moby Dick.  Yeah, fat fatties. 
[01:32:30]  Chubby chaser.  All right, well-watching isn't that manly, but all right.  It was boring, too.  And it was like three hours.  So you went to the boutique.  Did a little shopping.  And then we went to tea dance, which is in the afternoon.  They have a little...  We have cocktails and you dance.  And it's called the Boat Slip is the name of the bar.  Those gay bars have the best names.  The Boat Slip, the Mind Shap.  You're a pile driver. 
[01:33:00]  In the afternoon, they have cocktails and dancing.  And I'm on this big deck outside.  It's so much fun.  Can you just say happy hour drinks, please?  Yes, yeah.  Oh, you know?  You've been there?  No, but just don't say cocktail.  Lots of Cosmos.  Lots of Cosmos.  The universal beverage of the homosexual.  So then what?  And Mike's Hard Lemonade.  I like that, too.  Mike's Hard Lemonade.  Oh, okay. 
[01:33:30]  Mike's Hard Lemonade.  Right.  All right.  And what else, Marco?  So we went to the tea dance and that's where I met Greg.  I saw him across the deck and I was like, oh, he looks so yummy, luscious.  He has the most dreamy blue eyes.  And I went running over to him.  He was like, hello, my name is Greg.  I'm from Salem.  Are you from Boston?  No, I'm from New York.  The sounds of gayness.  And it was like, some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, it was, it was like, oh.  It was actually romantic.  I actually didn't sleep with him on the first night.  Oh, wow.  Look at you holding your butt back.  Look at you saving yourself.  Well, I wanted him to think I was pure.  Yeah.  What were you healing from the night before?  Well, I didn't want him to think I was a tramp or anything.  Oh, so this guy was someone special. 
[01:34:30]  Yes, he's very special.  So you waited for the second night.  Yeah, what did I wait?  I got to ask the gay guy something, gay Marco.  What do you give up for someone special?  Like, there are ladies out there, you know, they give up the, you know, the blue knot for  someone special.  There's always something they'll give up for someone special.  That's what you give up.  Yeah, but.  That's it?  But you're already giving that up.  You know what I mean?  Well, no.  There's girls out there just giving up the peach, but then they find someone special  and they feel like, well, I'm going to give them something special. 
[01:35:00]  I'm going to give them the blue knot.  Well, some people, they just do, like, rub.  Like me, I give up everything if they're hot.  What could he possibly be saving?  A nostril?  I mean, there's nothing this guy hasn't done.  But if I'm really not into them totally, like, I'll just do, like, the oral thing and  that's it.  All right.  Oh, there you go.  So even if you're not into somebody, you're giving that up.  Exactly.  Like drinks.  Randy, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Hey. 
[01:35:30]  Congratulations on syndication.  Thank you.  I'm a gay guy.  I love you guys.  Yeah, but listen to this.  So you enjoy our show.  I do, definitely.  First of all, I mean, Marco, you're great.  You are kind of a fag.  That's what I am.  All right.  He's not denying it.  All right.  So what's your point, Randy?  You want to go out sometime?  Are you cute?  Yeah, I'm 25.  Ooh.  Um, 5'10".  I weigh about 195.  Oh, you're a chubby little boy.  No, no.  I lift weights every...  Shut up, dude.  You're a chubby little guy. 
[01:36:00]  I lift weights every day.  Oh, yeah?  That's the 195.  Oh.  Of muscle, then.  Right.  Now we're having fun.  All right.  What else, Randy?  What does he think?  I think you sound luscious.  Yeah, you know, the guy from Salem is not going to call you, by the way.  Hey, how do you know that?  I just do.  You don't go to Provincetown to meet people.  You go to the...  I know.  Hey, wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Whoa, hey, hold on.  Easy there.  Slow down there, Saler.  Oh, sorry, that's why I can't say that. 
[01:36:30]  They just go to P-Town to have sex.  Yeah, like Spiritist Pizza is the place he's talking about.  Yes.  People hang out in front of the pizza place.  It's called the Pepperoni Factory.  People go there.  You gay people.  People go there at 2 o'clock in the morning to get, you know, those are the people who  didn't hook up at the A-House.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  No, thank you.  Oh, and O&A, let me introduce some terminology to you guys.  Yeah.  The ultimate thing to do, you guys were just talking about, like, I guess girls get something  called the balloon nut.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Well, for gay guys, it's called the glass-bottom boat.  The glass-bottom boat.  You know what that is?  What?  That's when you take a piece of saran wrap, and you put it on the guy's face, and you  put it on his face.  Right.  I don't think that made it through, but we'll try our best to...  Hold on.  Did I make the radio?  No, probably not.  Watch how Ant does it.  All right.  What you're saying is they put a saran wrap over one guy's face.  Right.  And then deliver what is commonly called the Cleveland Steamer or the Hot Lunch. 
[01:37:30]  Very good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to let you gay guys know.  So, Marco, what do you think?  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  Well, you can email me.  My email address is heygaymarco at AOL.com.  Is that your picture on Foundry Music?  No.  That older guy?  That's Liberace.  That's Liberace.  Oh, is it?  I thought it was Wayne Newton.  They call each other fags.  I know.  What do you look like, Marco?  I feel better calling the guys fags now. 
[01:38:00]  Marco.  If the gay guys are calling each other fags, we could do it.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Marco.  Yes.  Describe yourself to Randy.  All right.  I'm 5'11".  I have short brown hair, beautiful green eyes, a luscious body.  I weigh 170 firm pounds.  How big is it?  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  You can't ask him how big that is in that terminology.  Can I do it again?  No, no, no. 
[01:38:30]  Just, uh...  No, Marco heard you.  Marco.  Just, just, uh...  Marco, just throw a number out there.  Seven.  Seven?  Seven?  Yes.  Ugh.  What's wrong with seven, uh, Randy?  Randy.  I've got about two inches on him.  Ooh.  All right.  Look, look.  We gotta go.  Isolate that.  Ooh.  That was the gayest sound.  Ooh, Billy.  All right.  You guys, we're pretty much done with you.  Marco, thank you.  I'm gayed out. 
[01:39:00]  So, O.B. and Anthony, can you send us out on a date?  Ah.  Dear.  Like having your background.  Hey, uh, Randy, you got Marco's, uh, email address?  I do.  Yeah, so just, uh, send me an email.  Email them.  If you guys hook up, you can call us up and, uh, let us know how it works.  Got milk?  All right, guys.  Sounds pretty good.  Thank you.  There goes gay Marco and gay Randy, Anthony.  Wow, that was, uh, that was a gay little segment.  Hey. 
[01:39:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm talking about it.  Huh?  Huh?  I'm talking about it.  Huh?  Every man wants to be a macho, macho man.

[01:41:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Okay, terrific.  Hey!  Yeah.  We're rocking.  You never hear enough village people, do you? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, yeah, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's the O&A Show.  Toll free 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  A lot of people very pissed off after that last segment.  We'll be back with the O&A Show.  Stay there.  O&A Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys could come up with?  1027 WNEW.  Barry Williams is right outside. 
[01:42:00]  Are we keeping you waiting?  What are you, crazy?  How many stations I could be doing right now?  Hell no.  We don't keep you waiting.  We're waiting in the outer office there.  Can we call you, Johnny?  Can we call you, Johnny?  You're whisked right in.  But I should be.  Of course.  I should be.  Big star.  Come on.  I met all the news girls upstairs.  Yeah, you like that?  1010 WNEW is upstairs.  They all needed to touch me.  They all wanted me to get some on them.  They all needed a little photo and a little signature.  They're there, yeah.  They needed to know that they are totally groovy and to be endorsed by the only one who can make 
[01:42:30]  them totally groovy.  Groovy.  And that is me.  Where the hell did you get those glasses from, man?  These are not.  These are sunglasses to me.  What are they?  Shades.  Shades.  Shades, yeah.  Shades.  And if you, you know, if you had your own radio show, you'd know that.  If he was walking in with those, he could just go to his parents and go, Mike, Carol?  Yeah.  You know, I'm kind of over the nice guy, all-American kind of thing.  Are you going to, like, go bad boy now?  I'm going bad.  I'm going bad.  You should do a couple of pornos.  That'll get you right in there. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Some of the people that call in here, I think, are getting ready for a shot.  It's insane.  I can't get past the shades, though, man.  I know you can't.  Can we see your eyes or what?  No, man.  No?  Well, all right.  I'll give you a little glimpse.  You get those from one of those Nigerians downstairs?  I guess you haven't been drinking with somebody.  I'll give you a little glimpse, but that's all.  You know, I just have to beg for more.  Okay.  Oh, there they are.  That's him.  That's Greg Brady.  That's the man.  All right.  I love when you say that.  I love when you say that.  Call me Mr. Bunch.  It's more formal than I don't know you that well. 
[01:43:30]  Mr. Bunch.  How you doing, Barry?  I'm hanging.  That's good.  It's good.  Yeah?  Do you know, I was in the studio a couple of months ago, and I was listening to you,  somebody about Midget World.  Yeah, we had a midget in on the show.  Yeah.  Wasn't she a porno midget?  Yeah, she had a porn star.  And I said, I have to do this show.  I was out there listening to, I go, I have to be a guest on this show.  We should have had the porno midget on when you were on.  Oh, I wish.  That would have been great. 
[01:44:00]  That would have been fun.  Find her website.  Yeah.  And she was going to dress up.  A Brady moment.  How was she going to dress up?  She was going to dress up like a little JonBenet, I think.  Yeah, a little JonBenet.  Yeah, we were going to get a little cowboy outfit.  That was too good.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, now calm down.  That's horrible.  I am going to take the shades off, because I think I've made an impression, right?  You have.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I could see it.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Let it go.  Now we're rocking.  Feel it.  I could not get this effing song out of my head for like, for like a day. 
[01:44:30]  I was hearing it.  Johnny is back.  Johnny is back.  Johnny is back.  There it is.  Don't you know what?  I'm ready to ride your town at night.  Rock you down.  Rock you down.  Johnny is back.  You've improved over the old Brady days?  Ready to dance till the morning light.  I can tell you that.  Morning light.  He's adding in a line.  Now, every move.  It's no, it's a sunshine day.  That's straight, buddy.  Everybody's smiling. 
[01:45:00]  Sunshine day.  No, no.  No, Perry, I've got to ask you something.  All right.  Ask away.  Who's supposed to buy this album?  Anybody who's in the spirit, who's in the mood.  Because if I bought this and I was tooling down Broadway, let's say, I think I would get  beat up.  Really?  I heard you like that.  Some people do that just to get beaten up.  Right.  Okay.  Hey, spin a little bit of Johnny Bravo and take your shot.  Yeah.  Take your best shot, man.  I don't know.  What do you think, Ed?  I think it kind of rocks.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  I like the Queen cover, actually.  That's like the one I was listening to.  Here comes my favorite lyric.  Making time on the floor in the bar.  Oh.  Johnny's still breaking hearts.  Oh, yeah.  Still breaking hearts there, Johnny?  You got that right.  You go, Johnny.  You go, Johnny.  You know, some people seem to miss the, you know, there is a little, a little bit of humor  in this spectacular song.  All right.  Of course there is.  You know, somebody gets a goddamn bummed out about it.  You know, say, hey, man, what, you're not serious enough about your music, so please, 
[01:46:00]  you know, like, just get that CD out of my face.  It's okay.  I mean, Johnny, what's that all about?  Yeah, you were just Johnny Bravo because you fit the suit, okay?  It's like, lighten up, man.  Have some fun.  You know, have a party, pour another piña colada.  You know, Barry, we smash a lot of CDs on this show, and we haven't smashed yours yet.  Oh, can I help?  Can I help?  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  Do you push a button, or do you really get, like, a smash hammer?  No, it's usually Opie just going crazy and smash.  Kathy Lee's album got just nailed yesterday. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, yeah, I would definitely be around for that.  But for some reason, I mean, we've played Johnny Bravo.  It hasn't happened yet.  Johnny's back a bunch of times on the show.  We haven't smashed it.  I want to keep it.  There's something about it.  It's like a car wreck for some reason.  Speaking of Kathy Lee, who is one of my favorite personalities, I would just love to get a version  of her singing the national anthem at another football game real soon.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  She's so talented.  On DVD, because you've got to get the eyes going on, you know, with a little bit of that  helplessness and looking up into the sky, pondering the question from all of America 
[01:47:00]  with a flag.  And have Cody and Cassidy singing backup.  Yes.  That was always a good thing.  With choreography.  Which is better.  Whoa.  Oh, that's right.  He did try for that, didn't he?  Didn't he?  It's been so long.  Well, guess what?  You know what the funniest part about that, too, is like, if you ever get turned down trying  to have anal sex with a girl?  Oh, you look bad.  You do.  It's really bad.  But it's just between you and whoever it was.  Yeah.  This was out in the public eye. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, everyone knew he was trying to get the anal and got turned down.  Well, you know what Frank doesn't know?  You're not supposed to go for the anal on the first sleepover.  You know, how long before you went?  You're supposed to introduce these things slowly, right?  How long before anal with Marcia?  How long?  Come on.  Well, now, do digits count?  Or just...  Actually, she was an easy...  Poor Maureen.  She was an easy sell.  You know, like about two pictures of margaritas and you are mine. 
[01:48:00]  There's been so much said about that.  She is the only girl I ever let call me Greg during sex.  Oh, really?  That is sick.  That was just a little...  You know, a little...  We were pretty bored as kids.  Quick before mom and dad come upstairs.  Yeah, who gives a better hummer?  Mom or Marcia?  Oh, no.  That's a good question.  You know what used to be really cool is watching the show while you're making out with your sister.  Oh, man! 
[01:48:30]  I know.  It's a little incestuous.  That is really bad.  But there's something really hot about that.  When you're a teen star, you've kind of done it all and been there and back.  You need things to heighten the emotion and heighten the effects.  So I used to just crank that old theme song up and go.  Here's the story.  Of a lovely lady.  And bringing up three lovely girls.  Or just the music like when the kids are walking down the stairs.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Oh, we got to...  Oh, oh! 
[01:49:00]  We got to play the Brady Bunch bits for...  Oh, we had a lot of fun at everyone's expense.  I can hardly wait.  At everyone's expense.  Well, we got some really sick ones, though.  Wait, let me guess.  You do a little goofing on the show?  A little spoofing, a little sarcastic.  You're missing some of the wholesome qualities.  No, it's not.  We just figured because...  It's not like Zoo Radio around here, Barry.  Okay, good.  No.  Man, dude, man!  No, our bits are a little more intelligent than that.  No bells, whistles, no.  And it came up with a great concept.  Well, we figured because Robert Reed, who was your pop, right?  Yes, that would be right.  Yes.  I knew that, but go ahead. 
[01:49:30]  Yes, I was just quizzing you.  Designed the house.  He was an architect.  Yes.  I just figured this out, by the way, because I've only been listening to you guys.  And the whole time I've been in here, I'm going, okay, now, which is Opie?  Which is Andy?  And I'm listening.  Andy.  We always get that.  Who looks like an Anthony and who looks like an Opie, you know?  Yeah, you're right.  But I've been listening.  I finally figured it out.  Yeah.  Anthony.  Right.  Very good.  Anthony, I got that right.  Let the stenographer record.  I am pointing at the right person.  The Italian.  It sounds like you've been in some litigation yourself. 
[01:50:00]  Hey, don't talk jail to me.  I didn't do it.  I didn't do it.  I wasn't even there.  And it's not my car.  Really?  Well, I want to know the story about that one.  No, no, no.  Okay, so we were talking.  I think we were going down there.  Robert Reed played your pop, of course, and designed the house, and he designed that stairs,  the stairs, from the bedrooms, with no backs on them.  Yes.  And then the underneath part was enough room for someone to stand and look up under the  stairs at the girls' dresses as they came down. 
[01:50:30]  Only Anthony would like that, you know?  You know something?  Because he's imagine he's got freeze frame on the television, and he has placed, transported  himself underneath the staircase from day one.  What I want to know is who is walking up the stairs when you, Anthony, are underneath  looking up.  Oh, Marcia.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I can give you a play-by-play description on that one.  That was always a biggie.  You saw her develop and everything, didn't you?  I did.  I did.  And in one night.  Yeah, it seemed to happen overnight.  The whole flowering process.  All of a sudden, she went from the kid with the, like, wacky crying face, I hate you! 
[01:51:00]  I hate you!  To the hot girl that the quarterbacks of the rival high schools wanted to date.  And in one hiatus, it all happened.  She went from young girl to sweet young thing.  Yes.  And what happened?  You came back to film, and you were like, yeah, Johnny's back.  He's ready to run.  Johnny needs some of that.  Yeah.  There's a lot said about that.  You know, I wrote the book Growing Up Brady.  I was a teenage Greg, but one of the working titles I had was Growing Up Brady, Inside 
[01:51:30]  Marsh's Marsh.  Whoa!  Whoa!  But we felt it was a little too edgy for her.  I think she had a...  It wasn't the first time she got hit in the face and said, oh, my nose.  Something else happened in there.  We have to take a quick break, but...  That damn football spit at me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  I like you, man.  You're all right, man.  We got to take a quick break, Anthony.  Yes.  I'm cold. 
[01:52:00]  Kleenex!  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  I'll shut up.  No, you can continue.  Please don't.  It's going to be more interesting than whatever you're going to read.  I know that.  No, we're going to play a song for you.  Oh, okay.  I'm ready.  Which one's this?  The Marsha Brady song.  Oh, yeah.  I was inspired by Marsha.  It's a quick ditty.  Is this one of your...  To pen this little ditty.  One of your...  Yeah, this we used to do.  The guys in the band.  You know, you understand.  Oh, totally, man.  I'm so down with that.  The Brady Six.  Oh, yeah.  Silver Platters, whatever you want to take. 
[01:52:30]  Hang in together.  It's been a long night.  Okay, go for it.  All right, chill.  This is too cool.  Tune it up, man.  All right, my guys.  Here we go.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Marsha, Marsha.  Okay, we got a dumb button.  Marsha, Marsha.  Marsha.  Looking at the screen, what does this feeling mean?  I got this liver way down deep in my loins.  See?  Her blonde hair's beauty, and who ain't she a cutie?  The best in every club that she joins.  Marsha.  She's doing all the fillers, her little sister jealous. 
[01:53:00]  Got her mama head to her toe.  The Barry's doing the dance.  The Brady Six dance.  With a flowered print shirt.  She's turning heads wherever she goes.  And all the things she does to me.  Yep.  Nice.  I got my very first boner watching Marsha Brady.  True.  I got my very first boner watching Marsha Brady.  True.  Very first boner watching Marsha. 
[01:53:30]  She's in shock, Anthony.  I know.  He just pissed this isn't on the new album.  I got my very first boner.  No, I'm just thinking, it wasn't my first boner.  It wasn't my first boner.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Yeah.  Phil Moe Jr.  Phil Moe Jr.  Hi.  Phil Moe.  F-F-F-I-L.  L-L-M-M-O.  L-M-O.  O-O-R-E.  O-R-E.  Phil Moe Jr.  Hi.  I'm holding the Hawaiian episode. 
[01:54:00]  But mommy started knocking on me.  Hawaiian episode.  Great one.  This is not bad.  Thank you.  This is not bad.  I could have used it for the soundtrack on that movie.  Yeah.  Good.  I had it.  And what a piece of ass when she took that hula class.  The skirt's so short, I think I saw her hair.  Yeah.  I think I did.  Oh, the thing she does to me.  You're in her virginity. 
[01:54:30]  Well, not after Barry got there with her.  I, I, I, I.  Got my very first boner.  I'm too far to breathe.  Kepsy.  Kepsy, Kepsy, Kepsy.  Kepsy, Kepsy, Kepsy.  Dory G.  Ay, ay, ay.  Right?  Very first boner.  Yeah.  See, how can you fit a boner into a song, you know?  I feel we're bonding.  We have something in common.  It's catchy, right? 
[01:55:00]  More fantasy and my reality.  See, look at that.  God damn.  I hate you.  So, here we go.  I hate you.  You're the guy that got the chick that I wanted.  He's bowing.  All right, listen.  We do have to take a quick break.  We got Barry Williams in the studio.  I got to talk about that.  We will.  I want to know.  We'll do it next.  212-757.  I got to know.  1027.  We'll be back.

Excuse me, you dropped this on my foot.  Oops, my bad.  Now, the full-sized keg. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, my foot!  Oh, my full part.  Get it off! Get it off!  Next, the tossing it to a buddy test.  The 12-ounce Heineken keg can.  Hey, Ted, catch.  Thanks, Bob.  Now, the full-sized keg.  Hey, Ted, catch.  Thanks.  Get it off!  What?  Crushed trachea!  Uh, what?  And finally, the crushing it against your forehead test.  The keg can.  One, two, three.  Yeah!  And the full-sized keg.  One, two, three. 
[02:01:00]  The 12-ounce Heineken keg can.  Scientifically proven to be more convenient than a keg.  Imported by Heineken USA, White Plains, New York.

[02:01:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  This is definitely a thrill for Ant and I.  We got in the studio Barry Williams.  Come on.  You can call him Greg Brady.  You can call him Johnny Bravo.  Yeah.  Or you can call me Hey You.  Or Hey You.  One friggin' episode of being Johnny Bravo and years later it still sticks.  Well, the suit still fits.  Johnny Bravo.  Oh, does it?  Of course, I had to have it made for me, but that ensured a good snug fit.  Who could forget adios, Johnny Bravo.  Not me.  When you finally got your balls. 
[02:02:00]  Say buenos dias, Johnny Bravo.  Yeah, what happened there?  You were all dead set against it.  Adios, Johnny Bravo.  Johnny Bravo returneth.  You sold out the siblings.  You're going solo.  Blowing off college.  I had the right idea.  I had the right idea.  And then, in a twist of just horrible fate,  Greg gets the idea that changing his sound is not a good idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's to say?  I mean, what is the sound? 
[02:02:30]  Say my sound.  It doesn't even sound like me.  Good thing.  It's not about me, man.  Yeah.  That one guy, hey, it's not about me, man.  I'm telling you, there could be a lot worse things than fitting the suit.  A lot worse things.  Which is why I have set out to right that wrong.  Yes.  A little later.  Bringing it back.  Bringing it all back.  Johnny Bravo.  Here we are.  You're doing a book signing, Barry, huh?  I don't know.  I just point and shoot.  Yes.  You are, though.  And people should show up and give you love.  I would like that.  It's going to be at the NBC Experience at Rockefeller Plaza. 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  Have you seen this place?  No.  Incredible.  I was up there, actually, today.  It's two floors.  It's interactive.  They've got video things.  You can sit down with Jay Leno.  You know, they do a little thing, and he's there, and he kind of pops the questions,  and they have an audience that laughs.  Like the king of comedy.  Yeah, exactly.  Ma!  Ma!  It's a little scary.  I mean, I did it twice, because I can't get on a show.  And so I wanted to get the full experience, and it was a little creepy. 
[02:03:30]  Why the hell wouldn't Jay have you on?  I don't know.  Jesus.  I don't even know if it gets to Jay.  We have to talk to the people.  You know, he's about...  Well, it's Barry Williams.  Well, I don't know.  Jay Leno's on.  He's about four layers deep in people, right?  And then you get on the show.  Barry!  You know, it's great, man.  Here you are.  You've got to blow up on Britney Spears.  They've got to...  Barry Williams.  I did Rosie O'Donnell's show about a week and a half ago, and I love the Rose.  I just...  I love the Rose.  Well, I'm sure she's very big on the old show, so... 
[02:04:00]  But she says to me, she says, the first thing she says to me, I can't believe that you haven't  been on my show before.  I've been calling her every month for a year.  Rosie, think it's time, man.  The CD just broke.  Just released the book.  The movie's coming out, Rose.  Love to come on the show.  Yeah.  And if she can't believe it, I want to know who's not talking to her.  Hold my calls.  I'm eating a Twinkie.  Stop.  I'll be right back.  Oh, look, see?  Oh, we found a soft spot.  We found Barry's Edge.  Yeah.  See, he's friends with her because he can't bang her. 
[02:04:30]  That's what it is.  Don't think she's interested.  Yeah.  Don't think she's interested.  We've got to spell it out here.  Okay.  Completely understand.  So, did you happen to catch on Fox last night, they did a little Brady Bunch movie?  Oh.  A little short movie?  Fox did a little Brady Bunching.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little skimming.  Oh, you weren't a part of that one, Barry?  I think they called it the unauthorized Brady Bunch.  Yeah.  Do you know why they called it unauthorized?  Why?  Because it was. 
[02:05:00]  No one had any say on that one.  No, this is something that they extract from what we call in the business, public domain.  Oh.  Which means they go through a bunch of clips from Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood  and Star Magazines.  And base the movie on that.  And base the movie on that.  Oh, by the way, did I mention they borrowed liberally from my book?  Oh, really?  Oh, sure.  Oh, sure.  But just enough to keep the facts straight.  Then they delivered it in a completely botched up way.  Well, you know, it really would have sucked if they didn't get such fine actors to portray  it.  Oh, really?  And lookalikes. 
[02:05:30]  It was fascinating.  I mean, I swear to God, I had to get them.  I turned it on and I said, I am seeing myself.  It's like a mirror.  Well, there I am in all my glory.  A little fatter, a little taller, about 10 years older and smoking the wrong cigarettes.  But there I am being very cool, stuck up and conceited.  Well, they got that right.  But the rest of the people.  Well, everyone knows you smoked a valiant cigarettes.  I believe it was.  No, no, man.  That's a big V.  No, a Marbar, man.  I'm talking on the show when Greg got caught smoking.  Big V. 
[02:06:00]  I can't stand it.  Valiant cigarettes.  But it wasn't your jacket.  It wasn't your jacket.  It was your pal that you were in the band with.  Hey, can you believe my mom believed that?  What a line of crap.  And that stuffed shirt, mother of your friends, that came over the house like,  we're doing a meeting about smoking in our high school.  The PTA lady.  The PTA lady, right?  What a stuffed shirt.  And then your pal sells you out.  I know.  Hey, dude, you left these cigarettes.  It's not my jacket.  It's your jacket.  Oh, Greg, thanks.  And then you ratted him out, though.  Of course I didn't. 
[02:06:30]  You noticed he wasn't on our next episode.  He wasn't.  That's a good thing about having your series.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't real.  Stop it.  You just stopped.  I watched it like 80 times.  I know it happened.  It wasn't real, Anthony.  It's a TV show.  And they found out because he had ripped it, and Alice sewed up the jacket.  So that's how he knew it was his.  All right, so speaking of Alice, here's the litmus test.  Yeah, yeah.  Speaking of Alice, now we know she made the meatloaf and the hot Christmas turkey dinners  and stuff.  Yes.  And we know that she actually, and I know this was a trick of double photography, but 
[02:07:00]  she was actually Sergeant Emma Ennell.  Same person.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  But she also, our beloved housekeeper, had a last name.  Yeah.  And I'm just searching for that.  Hold it.  Searching for that last name.  Oh.  God damn it.  I can help.  It's the short-term memory.  Think Ozzie.  And I don't mean Osborne.  Osborne.  No.  Not Osborne.  Ozzie.  No. 
[02:07:30]  No.  Hold it.  Harriet.  Yeah, Nelson.  It was.  Yeah, it was.  Yeah.  Nelson.  Okay.  Now, there'll be more.  Yeah.  There'll be more.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm only giving you half a point because I could see that it was floating around in  the upper part of your brain.  I'm trying to think of where that name came out in one of the episodes, but I can't remember.  All right.  My short-term memory is shot.  Well, now that you have the next two nights of reading worked out for you.  Yes.  Yes.  You'll be able to get that fact and many more.  Growing up reading, I was a teenage Greg.  Yes.  You know, and we thumbed through it.  I actually read one of the books. 
[02:08:00]  Was that your book talking about how Robert Reed was upset with a lot of the episodes and storylines?  Yes.  Yeah.  In fact, I interviewed him over several days, and he supplied the actual memos.  He said, man, I think I've got these up in the attic.  In fact, he was dying at the time.  I didn't know it at that time, but he went up and he got these memos, and maybe that was  part of it.  He wanted to share who he was and what he was about with this show, because I think  he actually improved the show.  But some of these memos were unbelievable. 
[02:08:30]  Like, they would write these episodes, and Robert Reed, I think he wanted to be accepted  as an actor, as a thespian.  Well, not thespian, lesbian.  I won't even get into that.  But he wanted to be accepted as, like, an actor.  And they would come up with these ludicrous episodes sometimes, and he would be upset  with the storyline.  Like, no, my character wouldn't react that way.  And write these memos to the producers.  It's like, it's the Brady Bunch.  It's like fluff, fun kind of show. 
[02:09:00]  Sure.  It doesn't have to be serious.  He was coming from a completely different place.  He studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.  He was classically trained.  He was accepted as a thespian.  Thespian.  And did a lot of Shakespearean plays.  Wore the tights, you know, the whole thing.  Ah, wow.  And Defenders, you know, where he was nominated for Emmy Awards with E.G. Marshall.  So, I mean, he did have that whole thing going on.  And, of course, the other thing he had going on.  Now, did you know that he was a gay man?  Uh, after our second date. 
[02:09:30]  Really?  Yes.  Yeah.  How many times has he said that?  I make light.  Good kisser, by the way.  Greg!  Greg!  Right.  Just not after 5 o'clock without a second shave.  No, I mean, at some point, you do.  I mean, you know kind of what's going on with your co-stars.  Right.  I mean, you know, you know, which, let's say, which time of the month to stay away from.  Marcia, for instance.  Really?  All that stuff.  Wow.  And you know what's going on with Robert Reed because you're close. 
[02:10:00]  You know when to make the move on Florence Henderson because she's vulnerable and feeling lonely.  Now, as per the Fox little TV movie, you got turned down by Mrs. Brady.  Yeah, I mean, that's accurate.  That's accurate?  You went on a date.  We went on this one date, right, you know.  And I was throwing all my best Greg Brady moves on her.  And I had my imagination going.  A little extra bottle of Weston oil in the backseat in case.  With protection.  And, by the way, if you ever use Weston oil, never heat it beyond 82 and one half degrees.  You'll get burned the heck out of your back. 
[02:10:30]  And so I was doing all, I had all my little childhood fantasies.  My teenage hormones were raging and what have you.  You must have gotten so much young tail that you finally decided you wanted some older tail.  I needed experience.  I needed experience.  I was tired of training all these, you know, these wannabe, you know, groupies.  And I, you know, I just felt that I was missing something.  Now, there's Florence, you know.  Hair.  You were missing hair.  Oh, God.  And then you're right. 
[02:11:00]  And I brought the Weston oil, but not the razor blade.  And so I was, you know, I was hoping I'd get a little, you know, a little instruction.  But, you know, she was not in that vein.  No.  She let me kiss her.  She let me give her kiss.  She did, huh?  She let me kiss her.  Like a passionate kiss?  A little pack or something?  No, I didn't get past her tonsils or anything.  No, no.  You know, a little, like, wet lips.  God, that must have just looked.  Oh, it was good.  It was good.  Oh, no, but it was great. 
[02:11:30]  It was fantastic.  It must have looked just so hard to get.  In my movie, it looks fantastic.  It looks great.  What is your movie?  Is that the other one Sunday?  Sunday night, right.  On NBC, 9 o'clock, right?  Can you believe I squeezed a movie out of this deal, too?  Wow.  Talk about the milk wagon.  Now, this, of course, I have to see.  What can we expect in a movie?  Well, listen.  All the dark, dirty secrets.  I made this movie for you.  Did you?  Good.  I made this movie for you.  That's for me.  Because, I mean, particularly if you've, like, heard some of the rumors, maybe even read 
[02:12:00]  the book, that kind of thing, the movie won't disappoint.  But instead of just describing, like, little romps in the swimming pool or in the bedroom,  yeah, I mean, you actually see, like, tops coming off and intertwined and the towels and  the music going on and tongue going on.  Like, passion.  Did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it.  Yeah.  You hear some of the Brady Bunch with, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  The porno version of the theme song.  No, we have cool tunes going on in the background, you know, like Crystal Blue Persuasion and that  kind of stuff.  Right, the groovy tunes of the time. 
[02:12:30]  Of the time, right.  Is that something you kind of forget?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Marcia.  I mean, yeah.  I think I'm having an acid flashback.  Hang on, guys.  I'll be with you.  Put on your Fillmore Junior High cheerleading outfit and run through the drill for me.  Jen, you spastic little bitch, get over here.  Was she that spastic in real life?  I mean, she really came off as a tool.  I just want to say, Jen, lighten up.  On the show.  Just lighten up.  Has she gotten to the point where she doesn't want to be associated with the thing? 
[02:13:00]  She's pretty angry, yeah.  Yeah, she doesn't, I can't get her, you know, she doesn't want to do, and that's, you know,  it's hard for her, because even though she looks the least, like, she's changed her hair.  Yeah, made it rich.  Who did forget Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway?  Yes, Jen Brady running away.  Yes, all of a sudden she's like this runaway, this was shortly after the show went off,  and she's a prostitute getting banged.  I was like, oh, where do I go to get a piece of that for a buck?  It's Jen Brady, for God's sake.  And she wasn't charging enough, you know, 50 bucks, really.  Come on, it's Jen Brady, for God's sake. 
[02:13:30]  Let's go, let's go.  50 bucks an hour.  Anyway, and a brilliant stroke of concept programming.  But actually, she's quite good at it.  Anyway, she's over the Brady thing, and we're friends.  I mean, we still talk and all that stuff, yeah.  But she doesn't, like, she wouldn't come to the premiere or anything like that.  No.  Everybody else show up?  Well, Chris Knight came, and Michael Lookingland came, and Susan Olsen came, and I think old  Flo Flo would have come.  Did Mike drive for a cab or something?  Not a very good race car driver, was he? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, those reunion shows were tragic.  Not only that, but, I mean, there was the mug shot.  Who wants to see Bobby in a mug shot?  You know what the concept behind that was?  They figured they wanted, we did, like, this boffo rating thing with a very Brady Christmas.  So the network, like, in a typical gesture of overkill, decides, okay, let's see.  Let's bring the Bradys back.  As a special?  No.  Why?  Well, we've been successful that way.  As a half an hour, like the original show?  No, not enough Brady time. 
[02:14:30]  Let's just stretch this puppy out.  Give him a full hour every week.  And, let's see, it's the 90s.  We can't just travel back.  Let's give the Bradys problems.  Yeah.  But, like, real problems.  It's not the kind that we're all, like, happy and familiar with.  You know, like when Cindy comes running down the stairs and screams across the living room,  past the horse, at the top of her lungs, saying, you know,  Where's my kitty carry-all?  I can't buy my kitty carry-all.  I'll just chill out.  Cindy, kitty carry-all.  Now, boys.  Tiger's doghouse.  Whooped out.  You've taken kitty carry-all, boys. 
[02:15:00]  Yes.  Give it back to Cindy.  Or Cindy having the sniffles.  That was a bad one.  That was Jan.  Jan with the sniffles, right?  With the dog and the things.  You know, I've got to go against you here.  Cindy had the goddamn sniffles because your parents didn't want to go out on the town.  They were going to have a night out by themselves and leave you and Marcia in charge to babysit.  And Cindy had the sniffles, and they couldn't have a good night out because they had to keep calling the house  because Cindy had the goddamn sniffles.  I think we're talking two different episodes.  I was talking to one where Jan was allergic to the dog. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, okay.  That's a different one, right?  I mean, please let me back in the club.  And wait a minute.  Was she indeed allergic to the dog?  No, she was allergic to the new shampoo that the dog was using.  Well, the flea powder.  Yeah, the flea powder.  Oh, very good.  Okay.  Touche.  Touche, Mr. Williams.  I'm back.  I'm back.  Touche.  I am back.  All right.  Could someone just shoot me in the head with a small caliber weapon on the bay of my skull?  You're doing well, though, Anthony.  Trying.  You're doing well.  Bobby, bring in the gun.  Bring in the gun.  It's okay, son.  Bobby. 
[02:16:00]  Bobby, go get me some beer.  Well, we've got a couple things happening here.  The listeners have all sorts of questions they want to ask you.  We've got a surprise for you.  Do you want your surprise now?  I just hope I'm going to go to questions.  I hope, I hope, I hope they'll ask me really tough questions.  It's like, what was your favorite episode?  Oh, no, no, no.  What is my favorite color?  Barry, Barry, you don't know our listeners.  Barry?  No, no, no.  I'm about to find out.  Let me just, here's an example of one of the questions, okay?  Okay.  Barry, here's your chance to finally answer a childhood question for me. 
[02:16:30]  Did Marsha have a Hitler mustache, a 70s Earth Mama Muff, or a hardwood floor?  I'm liking your listeners.  All right.  I think I understand the direction we're going.  You really thought they were going to ask for your favorite episode.  How about this one?  All I can say is Heil Hitler.  Wow, she was ahead of her time.  Now, when you say head.  No, go ahead.  All right, just a couple more here, and we'll go to the phones and let the listeners ask themselves.  But these are the type of questions you could expect from our listeners. 
[02:17:00]  Mike from Lindenhurst.  Who gave the better Hummer, Marsha or Mike Brady?  All right.  Mike had the experience.  I'm going to have to go to my episode guide in the back of my book for that one.  Very special Hummer.  Now, my question would be in which year?  Now, this is year three or year four or year five.  That was the episode when Greg wrote in to elect the father, father of the year.  Yeah, yeah.  We're coming into the room at night.  Yeah.  These are the listeners.  So there are no twisted people out there.  No, these are. 
[02:17:30]  Okay.  We did not write these.  Joe, Greg, you've got your own bed over here.  You don't want to wake up Peter and Bobby in the bunk bed.  Right, right, right.  Joe from Jersey.  Just bring me the goat.  I'll be happy.  Joe from Jersey wants to ask you, did you get circumcised from Marsha's braces?  Whoa!  How did he know?  Dante from Jersey.  You should have seen a cup I needed.  Well, anyway.  Dante from Jersey.  Do Barry's fingers smell like Florence Henderson?  Let me check.  They have that certain westernality.  All right.  Yes, they do when she's in a desperate mood. 
[02:18:00]  Donald from White Plains.  This is a real question.  Did you actually make out with Marsha Brady?  That would be a big yes.  Did you have sex with Marsha Brady?  Well, you define sex.  Heavy petting.  Heavy petting.  Heavy petting.  Define sex.  I like the way he thinks.  Well, I mean, you know.  Oh, God damn.  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say.  Now, are we talking Montecristo here?  All right, let's just put it this way.  Matt from Morris County.  Okay.  Hello, Matt.  On the same wavelength.  Wavelength, okay.  Inquisitive minds want to know, ask Greg if he ever hit Marsha in the balloon knot 
[02:18:30]  and sprayed happy sap all over her turd cutter.  Oh, my God.  What are you people insane?  I think we have found the line.  Yeah, there it is.  It's taken a while, but I think we have found the line.  Well.  I need a dictionary just to interpret that question.  Was that English?  This kid is too hip for the room.  Jeez.  I mean, you really thought they were going to ask you about your favorite episode?  These are our listeners.  We love them.  And figure out new ways to describe various anatomy parts. 
[02:19:00]  What?  Blue.  Balloon knot.  Balloon knot.  Balloon knot.  Balloon knot.  You ever hear that one?  Okay.  That's a tough one.  That's an image.  And, frankly, in this case, a beautiful one.  And the front.  Oh, my God.  God damn.  And the front door.  That is great.  Front door, whale's eyes.  Sweet as silk.  Okay.  Yeah, there we go.  Can you imagine?  Stay away from Mexican.  And, son of a bitch.  Marsha Brady. 
[02:19:30]  Every guy's dream back there.  All right, listen.  Now, are you still brave enough to go to the phones?  Absolutely.  Okay, we'll do that next.  I think he's fearless.  He is truly Johnny Bravo.  We also have a nice gift for you.  Yeah, I can't wait.  After commercials?  Yeah.  A trip to Hawaii, maybe?  Yeah, maybe.  A wheelbarrow full of money?  We're going to Cleveland, kids.  Gee, thanks, Pop.  Gee, can we go to a new, underdeveloped amusement park that ABC needs to promote so that they  can get some money?  Is that what that was?  Of course it was.  Why the hell else would we be out there in the middle of nowhere? 
[02:20:00]  They would send them to Cleveland.  ABC owned the place, and they couldn't get anybody to go, so they made it a two-hour commercial  on our show.  God damn it.  That's great.  That's awesome.  Everybody thinks we're having a great time out there.  We're just doing their legwork.  All right.  212-757-1027 if you have only serious questions for Barry Williams.  No, I just had a cough.  I'm sorry about that.  Done enough of this fooling around here.  I want a serious, serious question.  Here it is.  Favorite episode.  Things like that.  Sure.  My favorite color. 
[02:20:30]  Sure.  Sure.  Of course.  All right.  More with Barry Williams in just a bit.  You guys, sometimes, like, piss me off, okay?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Now, don't you tell me to smile.  You stick around, I'll make you put your wire.  I know it's beyond what you can tell.  Maybe it's because I'm so versatile.  Sound profile.  I said, anyway, take you back when I hit poochow.  From the hunt you never had to the now. 
[02:21:00]  I brought the marathon to the recce-land mile.  When you get back on me, I will provide.  People always say my style is wild.  You've got calls.  You've got gas.  Step to me on the route for five.  If you want the better, go in tonight.  Coming from the 80s to check my style.  Go ahead to the route, stop job.  Can't see Opie to exile.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Some free phone lines available at 877-692-1027. 
[02:21:30]  It's like a telethon, this show.  Hey, we've got some free phone lines.  Calm down.  I've got to go to Jason real fast here.  All right.  He may have a good idea for the show.  Jason, what's up?  Oh, nice.  Hey.  Hey, man.  What's going on, guys?  What up?  Welcome to Shirley.  We love you down here.  Oh, thank you.  Got a great idea for you.  Okay.  Tourette's karaoke.  Tourette's karaoke.  Tourette's karaoke.  Nice. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, but we need someone with, like, severe Tourette's.  Imagine someone with Tourette's singing, like, a love song and just losing it.  Like that Gwyneth Paltrow karaoke movie.  You could sing the same song Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis sang.  Didn't you hear that one?  You didn't see that god-awful movie?  When I was on the cruise, they were playing it in the rooms.  Oh, no.  I swear to God, it was on in the background.  Oh, God, I just hung myself.  I know.  Okay.  Let the abuse start.  Go ahead.  I'm not even going to.  I won't even defend myself. 
[02:22:30]  You watch that faggot movie, faggot movie.  What movie was it?  I don't even remember the name of it.  I swear to God.  It was a-  Yeah, I don't watch it.  Was it raining that day?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was pouring rain.  Oh, God, I'm screwed.  What did I do?  We should say that Jim Brewer's here.  Brewer!  Faggot!  He had so much fun the other day.  He said, what the hell?  I'm coming back.  I never laughed so hard in my life.  Wasn't that fun?  The whooping monkeys killed me.  Whoop!  Whoop! 
[02:23:00]  We had a pissy the other day, man.  A lot of fun.  That was jackass rocking on.  Yeah.  Hey, should we invite the Ricans and the Jamaicans into the studio?  Oh, Jesus.  Now, hold on a second.  You did not tell me we'd be dealing with that today.  I am not ready for a situation where we got-  We have like-  It's like, it's the Rainbow Coalition in here.  Wow.  Not Earl.  Earl.  Earl's the white guy.  Bobby Bonilla.  Yes.  Bobby Bonilla.  Bobby Bonilla. 
[02:23:30]  What's up, Bobby?  Bobby.  Well, let's get your mic and mic in here.  Yeah.  And Angel, the angry Puerto Rican.  Angel is one of the most angry Puerto Rican guys.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Serious.  He just got out of jail.  He just got out of jail for protesting the bombing of Vieques in Puerto Rico.  Oh, yeah.  Here he comes.  This guy is hardcore Puerto Rican, man.  I love white, bro.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't even want to shake hands with the white guy.  I have never seen a whiter person than this dude.  Jim Brewer? 
[02:24:00]  Do you think Jim Brewer is really white?  Do you talk about Casper?  He's Wonder Bread, y'all.  Big time.  Welcome back to the free world, man.  You were in jail.  What happened, Hammer?  What'd you do?  Look at him with his Puerto Rican hat on.  He's got his Puerto Rican flag.  Drinking his Corona.  He has Corona.  Look, he's got to put the Puerto Rican flag over the mic.  What do you got to say that for?  How long were you in jail for, Angel?  Why are you bending over like this?  I don't know.  How long were you in jail? 
[02:24:30]  About six months because I couldn't afford the bail.  Six months?  What was bail to get out of jail there?  Three dollars.  Oh, man.  Sure.  I love when Whitey snaps on us.  How much was bail, though, to get out?  You were protesting.  You were on a restricted area.  What happened?  Well, I went over there with a group of people protesting the situation that, you know, Whitey's  blowing up my country.  What?  So, you know. 
[02:25:00]  You got to practice dropping bombs somewhere.  Why on my island?  Why didn't you do it in Long Island?  That's an island, right?  What, Long Island?  All right.  We'll do it over one day.  Yeah, no argument here.  We'll do it over Brentwood.  If you can take out Brentwood in Long Island, sure.  Why not?  Oh, God, man.  Why don't you speak?  Why don't you represent?  He's Jamaican.  We're in the same boat.  We're not bombing Jamaica.  We're people depressed, too.  Why are you saying the black guy is in the same boat as Puerto Rican?  No, we're not in the same boat.  Why?  We're in the different boat.  Oh, because you supplied the weed, right? 
[02:25:30]  The only bombers in Jamaica are the ones you're smoking.  The big, fat bomber.  Hey, look.  They wouldn't do that in Jamaica.  We're a little bit different over there.  You know that.  Well, anyway, I got arrested by a bunch of, again, white people.  White people arresting.  Were they military personnel?  Arresting you?  Yes, and then you do get strip shirts.  Did you pass any signs that said, restricted area, do not go in here?  It was in English, so.  Hey, it was in English.  Hey.  You have Spanish signs in the train station. 
[02:26:00]  Isn't Vieques a part of Puerto Rico that really isn't being used for anything?  That's people that go, we grow avocados.  We supply half of you guys.  We're blowing up avocados on Vieques.  We don't need avocados that bad.  I think if the Puerto Rican avocado supply dried up, we would still be a world power.  It would be okay.  Jesus, man.  So they haul you away.  They tell you your...  Who needs guacamole?  They tell you your bail is how much?  It's overrated anyway.  Oh, the dead...  Prickle. 
[02:26:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  So you use that kind of language there.  Uh, what, so how much was bad?  I want to know.  Six grand.  Six thousand dollars because you tread on restricted ground.  Yeah, and plus I started using profanity to the cops and everything, and you know, I didn't  want to be in jail, so I started making a ruckus inside.  Well, to not be in jail, you don't make a ruckus. 
[02:27:00]  Was your alcohol involved?  No.  You weren't drinking the Coronas out there in the bombing range?  No.  But is the cops Puerto Ricans?  No.  Over there, no.  Oh.  No?  No.  Dominated.  You see, but you see, we're under the control of you guys.  You guys tell us to jump, we gotta jump.  We're under your payroll.  You could break away.  You could break away.  Wait.  Whose side are you on?  Hey, look.  He's Jamaican.  We got a black guy.  Hey, you got a black guy.  No, no, no, no.  Check this out.  We are the black guy.  We are the children.  Yeah, man. 
[02:27:30]  Check this out.  We used to be under the British.  Jamaica used to be under the British.  We'll break away, man.  Independent.  Move on.  Now there's hedonism and all kinds of fun stuff going on down there, right?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Rocks in Jamaica.  Jamaica rocks.  That's what I'm saying, man.  You don't gotta take that.  You're damn right, but they're blowing out some.  No, no, no.  They're throwing a missile at us.  What's that all about?  Leave us alone.  They're not bombing the capital.  They're not bombing towns.  It's a bombing range.  Yeah, they're just trying to improve the area. 
[02:28:00]  Look at Nevada.  There's a whole state we bomb all the time because there's nothing going on in Nevada.  Speak up, Rick.  It's just a piece of land used as a bombing range.  So what happened to you in jail?  It's a little depleted uranium.  You know, I had to fight people off, you know.  Did you?  Now I heard you got strip searched.  Yes, yes.  When you went in.  A cavity search.  How's that?  Not too good.  Not too good. 
[02:28:30]  Not too good.  I don't recommend it.  Injuring the ****.  Nice.  Okay, nice.  Oh, wait.  No, first they had to.  They did use a little lube, so it wouldn't hurt so much.  He's spittin'.  He couldn't take that one.  That hit a little too close to home.  Sorry. 
[02:29:00]  I reminisced.  We just found out he's not a swallower.  Spittin' the beer all over the studio.  He's not a swallower.  So how'd you get out?  You just, like, served your time?  Yeah, I served my time and I'm on community service and everything, so I'm not allowed  to ever do that again.  But I went to protest on your fellow brother, Al Sharpton.  Fellow brother?  Al Sharpton's Jamaican?  I didn't know.  You're lumping every black guy into...  He's black.  He's black.  Well, he's black.  Same thing. 
[02:29:30]  It's tall.  We got nothing to do with him.  Yeah, it's different black people.  Yeah, it's different.  Right.  You're black, but you're brainwashed.  By who?  By whitey.  You're brainwashed.  You guys brainwashed.  You guys brainwashed.  Not only black girls got brainwashed, but you got Jamaican.  What's your name?  Look here.  Jamaican mind.  Hey, Jamaica's a hundred percent black.  A hundred percent black kid.  Remember that.  Did you read?  You say the bombing is the one nobody visiting Jamaica right now?  Who?  Jamaica's nice, man.  Go there, you smoke some weed.  We always be nice.  Number one.  Huh?  Jamaica's being bombed right now. 
[02:30:00]  By who?  We're not bombing, man.  We're just...  Fighting and everything.  There's a few people that are getting knocked.  Free Puerto Rico.  That's the way it is.  Free Puerto Rico now.  Angel.  Free Puerto Rico.  Why don't you live in Puerto Rico?  Yeah.  I'm trying to create some kind of movement here.  I want my own currency.  I want my own state.  I want my own...  Listen...  Al Shopkin could do that for you.  Riverdale.  Riverdale.  I want my own currency, too.  Thank you for checking in, Al.  I got to buy a new big hubcap medallion. 
[02:30:30]  Hey, Paul.  Made out of gold.  I want my own currency, too.  It's called keep away from the you-know-whats.  That's worth at least $1,000 in my book, hotshot.  Now, where's your donkey?  For a puppy in a snot box.  This is America.  Now, wake up or get off the toilet.  You want, like, a completely different, independent Puerto Rico.  You damn scared.  So go to Puerto Rico and become like a...  But I have to start the movement here.  Why?  Because this is where the oppression starts. 
[02:31:00]  No one cares in America.  The oppression?  Who is this, people?  We call them, man.  Esto ta jodon, man.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Let's stop it, man.  Come on, English.  Give us some English around here.  What the hell is that, man?  Give us some English around here.  Come on.  God, man.  Yeah, even the Jamaican guy speaks English.  God, you could turn off the light, honestly, man.  You guys would glow in here.  Look how white you guys are here.  Wider than white. 
[02:31:30]  You're like a bunny rabbit.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Well, it didn't work out for you in the protest.  Hey, the struggle keeps on.  Are you back at work?  Filling applications.  Wait a minute.  You're taking advantage of America.  How are you paying your bills if you don't have a job right now?  Like that damn U.S. dollar.  What?  Damn the U.S. dollar.  Unemployment?  Are you on unemployment?  No.  It's called government assistance. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, wow.  The oppressive government is assisting you.  You're being a hypocrite.  He who asks is taken.  You have no problem taking the handouts.  No.  I like the paper money.  You could go down to Puerto Rico and work there and work to make Puerto Rico.  You could maybe be a leader down there or something.  Get an uprising going.  I'm trying to start it here.  Well, you ain't going to work here.  No one cares.  We go down there for vacation.  He's doing a great job by handing out the Coronas to everyone.  There you go. 
[02:32:30]  Where's mine?  Hey, he's going to be our first spokesman right here.  Right here.  Let me tell you something about it.  Listen, all 40 of you Puerto Ricans here in New York City and the three of you in the  rest of the country, hell, I'm with you.  Let's free you and maybe you go home for crying out loud.  And take my goddamn wife with you, hot shot, because this is America.  I'm going to go play with my donkey.  Now, shut up.  Oh, look who joins the party now.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:33:00]  It's a Hispanic love fest.  Now, Old Dirty just came in.  No, Old Dirty's Dominican, y'all.  Old Dirty's Dominican.  We got Dominican, we got a Puerto Rican, we got a Jamaican.  That's sick.  That's sick.  We're just white bread munched.  What are you going to get Sam Adams for?  It's Corona right there.  It's all right here.  This is what I drink right here.  Old Dirty.  What up, what up?  Jesus Christ, there's more than you see in the hotel housekeeping department here.  More Hispanics, man. 
[02:33:30]  Look at that.  Housekeeping!  Housekeeping!  Nice!  Oh, Dirty, man.  Don't show him the love.  You been hearing this guy?  The brother's misdirected.  Angel's a little misdirected.  He's a little bitter at America for some reason.  Bitter ain't the word, ain't it?  What you collecting, son?  What program are you on?  What program are you on?  Yo, what program are you on?  Yo, what program are you on?  What you on, man?  How many programs are there?  Where'd you collect it?  There's actually five programs out there.  Oh, Dirty, what are the programs?  Hold on, hold on.  Let me ask, let me ask Anthony.  Did you know there were five programs?  I didn't even know.  All I've ever used was unemployment.  Five programs that you guys are paying.  All I've used ever was unemployment.  That's pretty much it when I was out of work. 
[02:34:00]  What are the five programs?  There's unemployment, SSI, welfare, disability.  What was the last one?  Oh, yeah, they give you a one-shot deal  so I can lose your apartment.  That's it, y'know?  What are you doing?  I can lose your apartment.  That's what I'm into.  That's what I can lose your apartment.  That's what I can lose your apartment.  That's what I know.  That's what I do.  I know.  Dad, I'm gonna shoot your apartment.  How many programs are there?  What do you do?  What are the programs?  What are the programs?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me ask, Anthony.  Did you know there were five programs?  Time programs are there?  if I could lose your apartment.  That's it, though. 
[02:34:30]  I'm bad.  I want to live in America.  I want to live in America.  Hold on, hold on.  What's the one shot deal?  What's the one shot deal?  Hold on.  All right, you show up to the office.  Sometimes you want to get Wilfredo.  That's what we call welfare.  Wilfredo?  You call welfare Wilfredo?  Yeah, Willie.  He's got a name.  Big Willie.  It's called Big Willie.  Big Willie.  God, I hate you, God.  Like if somebody asks you,  where you going now?  I got to go see Willie.  I got to go see Big Willie. 
[02:35:00]  Sometimes, you know,  you got to go down and be like,  yo, I'm going to lose my place.  Right.  So sometimes if you don't get the welfare,  then you get the one shot deal.  Can't wait for August 5th.  What's this one shot?  Who came up with the one shot deal?  So then you fill out the paperwork,  then you go home and get all your receipts ready.  I mean, even if you got like behind two months,  you come in with like six months behind.  Right.  And they pay you off for like $1,500, $1,700.  And they pay off everything.  Everything, dude.  Bills, light bills, table, everything.  Bought to you by Uncle Sam.  Who the hell is the guy that legislated that piece of crap? 
[02:35:30]  Who's the politician that slid that one under the wire?  And August 5th, I get brand new.  August 5th.  It's called Family First Card, by the way.  What is it?  Remember they used to do the components?  Yes, son.  So dollar bills?  Now they put in a credit card.  They put in a credit card.  What is it?  They put in a credit card.  You go in the supermarket.  All you got to do is take your Family First Card.  Yeah.  And then they just deduct it off your account.  And what's this account?  Where's the money coming from in the account?  From your people's dollars.  Oh, my God. 
[02:36:00]  You notice all the white guys in the room?  Because this is radio.  We don't have a clue.  We're all staring like deers caught in headlights.  Like a retard looking at a Ferris wheel.  Like, what the F is going on?  The Family First Card.  Yeah, look at your pay stuff.  Oh, God.  Look at your pay.  This son of a bitch.  Look at your pay stuff.  Look at your pay stuff.  Family First.  Not my family.  Sorry.  Man, you got to, you know, you got to learn how to find out these little gems. 
[02:36:30]  Now, do you buy this stuff with the Family First Card and then maybe sell some of it?  No.  Big Willie gives it to you.  Yes, sir.  Big Willie, you go in and then you apply and boom, they give it to you.  Big Willie.  Yeah, Will.  That's it.  Willie Will.  Who is the dirtbag politician that came up with this crap?  We don't pay rent.  We just got to say, hey, I got a leak in my bathroom.  I'm not paying rent.  That's the best.  You know that?  Nah, son.  Come on.  What?  What do you do?  You got to get the whole building down.  Oh, dude.  Right.  You got to get the whole building down. 
[02:37:00]  So what does that entail, Old Dirty?  Oh, sometimes, you know, like if there's conditions in the building that are not livable.  Right.  But then, you know, you got to put the whole, like a little group together.  All the tenants.  And then they bitch that the landlord's a slumlord or something.  Yeah.  Then you go to court and everybody decides right there in the lobby.  And the best thing is when you get roaches.  Oh, nah.  But roaches ain't nice.  It's roaches.  That's what he's eating.  That ain't nothing.  So now, while this whole case is going on, you don't pay rent.  Nobody paying rent until the landlord repairs the building. 
[02:37:30]  And who's paying for this court time?  Well, the city and the state, they got to absorb those costs, my brother.  What you think you paying taxes for?  Section 8.  Nah.  Section 8.  Section 8.  You could go in Section 8 and they give you a fat, what, fat, I can say ass?  Yeah.  Fat-ass apartment, Section 8.  Yes or no?  So my man got a D-flick on the west side.  Got something on the west side.  So open, if you need a place to stay.  You got all this going on and you're pissed because we're bombing Stupid Island in the middle 
[02:38:00]  of nowhere.  Don't say Stupid Island.  You bastard.  Don't say Stupid Island, bro.  I think we're more than even right now.  A little bit.  A little bit.  On the real, man.  Trance around the house.  I want to fly over Puerto Rico and drop you on your head.  Miss Vieques and just, oh my God.  Yo, look at your pay stuff.  Look at your pay stuff.  He goes, look at your pay stuff.  S-U-I?  Come on.  I mean, seriously.  S-U-I? 
[02:38:30]  There's certain segments of the population that don't push up.  What do you do now if you get hurt or something and you need to maybe go medical attention?  Who pays for that and how does that get paid?  What are you talking about?  One emergency room trauma?  Yeah, what happens?  I give that guy.  Oh, what?  Hold on.  Let's over and talk.  I always give a fake name when I go to emergency room soon.  You give a fake name?  Look at these two.  They're high-fiving each other.  What's your name?  Jose Rivera.  And then tomorrow you go to Lincoln.  You know what I'm saying?  What's your name?  Carlos. 
[02:39:00]  And they'll treat you.  They got to treat you, right?  Yes or no.  Then you put down like Opie's address and everything.  And they send him the bill.  I live in Huntington, kid.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I'm telling you.  I don't even know what these things are.  Unbelievable.  I don't know what they're saying.  Sometimes you know you got to do that.  I am being educated.  When I came back from American Airlines, everybody in the plane, yes or no, when they come from  Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico, everybody, when they, we're approaching JFK. 
[02:39:30]  It's a party, kid.  Yeah.  I don't see it.  I want to live in America.  Everybody.  Yes or no.  Everybody starts clapping.  Yo, the first address, take it.  Well, now that you're here, you won't be needing your own home.  Yeah.  Welcome to America, Pedro.  Welcome to America, Pedro.  We ain't more like that. 
[02:40:00]  We ain't more like that, bro.  I haven't pulled an emergency room like in two years.  See, you guys.  George Bush is listening to your show.  Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.  Right.  These goddamn wetbacks are out there partying up.  Well, they got a home.  Well, tell you what, nowhere to go now, Pablo.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I need to pray.  I want to ride one of those bombs down like, what's his name from Slim Pickens. 
[02:40:30]  I thought sneaking in three of my friends into the Met game with a box ticket was like really bad.  These guys, you guys are living large off of the tax dollars.  No, not me.  Hey, I'm working.  You guys got all the scams going.  What are you working?  You're not working again.  I'm an independent contractor.  Spell drug dealer.  And I'm a speech motivator.  I'm into communications, man.  Oh, communications.  You're selling stolen cell phones.  Nah.  Nah. 
[02:41:00]  Nah.  Not like that.  We're providing a service to the community.  It's all for the cause.  It's all for the cause.  Jim Brewer, after hearing these guys go at it, he goes, hey, I'll be right back.  He comes back in the studio with his possessions and his knapsack.  I was hoping they had a gun in there.  Jim, is this your keys?  No.  All right.  All right.  We got the Enola Gay is leaving the tarmac, bound for Puerto Rico.  Her deadly cargo.  The atomic bomb in her belly as she rolls out on the tarmac. 
[02:41:30]  The Enola Gay.  That's what I want to hear.  Man, I'm getting pissed.  I need bomber aircraft.  You're getting pissed.  The Enola Gay flying over Puerto Rico.  Free Puerto Rico.  Free Puerto Rico.  All right.  Great.  All right, Dan.  I guess we'll take a break.  One guy in Philly is on the line.  He says, I'm never listening to you guys again.  He's that pissed off.  Mike, what's up?  Oh, hey.  Yeah.  I'm from Philly, man. 
[02:42:00]  You guys rock.  Get these guys, kick these guys out of the studio right now.  You know, the sad part is, though, this is reality.  I didn't know this crap was going on.  I didn't know they knew all the scams.  Oh, man.  They're laughing about it.  They're laughing in our face.  Yeah, hell yeah, they are.  Get them out of there.  Kick them.  Opie, physically kick them out of that studio.  Look, he already knows.  Then I could go on disability.  See?  You know, I wish I didn't live in Philly.  I'd be down there kicking their sorry ass. 
[02:42:30]  I'd do it for the benefits.  I'd do it for the benefits.  Wow.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot.  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  Opie and Anthony.  I was watching the MTV Movie Awards.  Yeah, blew it off.  Which sucked.  So bad.  So friggin' bad.  They had that Sarah Jessica Parker hosting. 
[02:43:00]  She was horrible.  Ruth Buzzy in a dress.  Her face is looking like Ruth Buzzy.  And she's like parading around.  She kept doing costume changes every like five minutes, you know.  She'd come out in a new dress.  And she's showing off like she's all hot and everything.  But, you know.  She used to be hot.  Those clothes are, exactly.  An L.A. story and a few years after that.  Her boobage were getting like all flat.  And like, it just wasn't working for me.  The last few years have not been kind to Sarah Jessica Parker. 
[02:43:30]  Not working for me.  And then everybody that was there.  Like all the big celebrities that show up for the MTV Movie Awards.  They're just there to hawk their movies.  That's all.  They had Samuel Jackson talking about Shaft.  He's wearing a Shaft hat.  He's up there Shaft this, Shaft that.  M or F-er.  They had to bleep every other word he said.  And then they had a, what's his face there?  It's in Patriot.  Oh, Mel.  Mel Gibson.  Yeah.  That's right.  Mel the boy.  Mel Gibson.  I'm on first name basis with him.  Mel.  Yeah.  Mel.  Mel.  Mel. 
[02:44:00]  Mel-y Mel.  They had him because he's got a movie coming out.  It's all a bunch of crap.  Anybody that didn't have a movie coming out wasn't going to do the movie award.  And it was obvious.  They were just there to hawk their movies.  There were no highlights at all?  Nothing.  It was boring as hell.  Boring.  Adam Sandler came out and read a little acceptance thing that was written from the kid from Big  Daddy.  Uh-huh.  And that was mildly amusing until it really started going too long.  He always goes too long. 
[02:44:30]  And that was it.  On those award shows.  That was it.  Like, that was the highlight, if you can even call it that.  Who do we have on the line?  Hey, you want to talk about the MTV Video Awards?  Dude, this thing sucked.  It was so bad.  I know.  I mean, I thought the South Park skit would save it.  It sucked too.  Yeah.  It was kind of funny when the gladiator killed Kenny.  I'm there like, wait a minute.  Timmy murder her.  Hey.  Hey, Timmy was in there.  Eh.  Timmy.  Oh, really?  They really tried to play that Sarah Jessica Parker thing off like it was going to be 
[02:45:00]  funny.  She was so bad.  And she can't talk like naturally.  It was obvious that she's reading from cue cards.  And all the MTV thing was supposed to be like the hip alternative to award shows.  And they all act like they're like it's the Oscars or something.  They're reading off the teleprompters.  They can't carry on a conversation with each other.  It was ridiculous.  The first few years of the MTV Movie Awards were pretty good.  It was cool.  You didn't know it was going to happen.  Now it's structured and it's like every other award show. 
[02:45:30]  It sucks.  They think it's like, oh, we're hip.  Look, the presenters come down on a slide from the back of the thing.  Wow.  That's cool.  That's different than the Oscars.  And then they step up to the podium and start giving the same long-winded, dopey-ass  speeches.  It used to be the anti-award show.  Now it's just another award show.  It's too bad.  It sucks.  Ha ha.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks, bro.  All right, cool.  Yeah.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Hey.  Hey. 
[02:46:00]  Who's this?  You're not Sarah Jessica Parker.  Oh, these are the fellas that were just trashing me.  Are these the guys?  Are you Sarah Jessica Parker?  I am indeed.  Now how do you prove that?  How do I prove it?  I don't know.  How does one prove their identity with the phone?  It does sound a lot like you.  I got to say that.  Do you listen to our radio show?  Or no, I don't.  As a matter of fact, my trailer driver had it on and I was fortunate.  The timing was absolutely, just absolutely beautifully fortuitous for me.  Sarah Jessica, I got to say your performance on the MTV Movie Awards, fantastic. 
[02:46:30]  I thought you did a great job.  I loved the costume changes, especially the one at the end.  You're such a puss, Ant.  What?  It's Sarah Jessica Parker.  You don't have the balls to actually say to me what you said to your maybe limited audience?  Come on, buddy.  Limited audience?  Come on.  We have a...  We get more people listening to this show than watching that Sex and the City.  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, I...  Are you certain of that?  Positive.  I watched the...  What the...  Hey, guys, listen, listen. 
[02:47:00]  I watched the...  Take it easy.  It's all right.  You're absolutely entitled to an opinion.  I just thought it'd be...  I just thought maybe I'd put a human face to, you know, some trash talk.  And I thought it'd be helpful to you to actually make it less abstract and more of a person.  I thought you were really hot in L.A. Story.  Hello?  That means the world to me.  Thank you.  Thanks.  So what do you guys do?  You're DJs on the air in New York City?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your chat show hosts?  Yeah, that's all we do.  We're not as famous as you or anything, you know. 
[02:47:30]  But listen, what I wanted to do, what I actually wanted to do, because I actually don't know you guys,  and I don't actually listen to the radio only because I don't have time,  not because I'm an elitist or I think I'm above it.  Why don't you come...  I simply don't listen to the radio that much.  But what I thought I might do, since you've hurt my feelings so terribly,  and since I actually am a person with feelings,  and you seem to have an idea about me that I'm sort of hideous and awful...  What?  Wait, wait, wait, don't!  Hold on, hold on.  Perhaps what I do, let me finish, fellas.  What does she want to do?  Let me have mine.  What do you want?  Perhaps what I do is I would invite you to the set if you're interested in coming. 
[02:48:00]  We're shooting in New York City, as you know, with our tiny little audience show called Sex in the City,  which is just bigger than ever.  I saw the season premiere, and I enjoyed the whole Staten Island thing.  You guys did this past week.  Thank you.  Well, thanks.  That's big of you.  Thank you.  What I thought I'd do is, if you guys are brave enough,  I thought perhaps you might want to come to the set and pay a visit  and actually see that I'm not a deformed, awful-looking person.  Oh, my...  Wait, wait, wait.  And he said, and actually, actually...  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:48:30]  He forced me to toot my own horn, and I will say this.  We didn't take it that far.  I've never been one that had been accused of being stilted in her speaking.  I've made numerous appearances on Letterman for God knows how many years.  Sarah, you seemed a little stiff.  Sarah...  I'd hardly be accused of being a stiff person.  Wait, we're just too...  Let me just...  Let me finish.  We're just two schmucks on the radio.  Let her finish.  What does it matter what we say?  Let her finish.  I think it's a rather daunting experience to be the host of an award show 
[02:49:00]  when one has not made a living nor a practice of doing that.  And I think that perhaps if you met me, you might actually discover that you like me.  You might actually be on my side.  You want to come down today?  We're...  No, no, no.  I work 18 hours a day.  I think you have to come here.  I think that's the best you can do as men is to trot your little seat down to my set.  Come visit me and say hello.  Oh, look.  Now she made me feel all bad.  I know.  No, Sarah.  You should.  You guys take pot shots and you don't realize we're people.  Man, we've got...  You're asked to do something.  Would you turn...  Would you say no? 
[02:49:30]  I didn't...  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me...  Whether or not you knew you had the...  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  We didn't say you were hideous or anything.  Yes, you did.  Not really.  We just said...  No, you absolutely, without question, inferred that.  Calling me Ruth Buzzy.  Calling me old.  I thought it was quite flattering when I said you're starting to look like Ruth Buzzy.  You damn people aren't supposed to listen to these goddamn shows.  You really think whoever you are, whichever one you are,  you really think that calling somebody Ruth Buzzy is a flattering comment?  You need to get out more often, my friend.  It's called humor.  We're just trying to have fun. 
[02:50:00]  You think people that heard that comment really go,  Oh, yeah, she's looking like Ruth Buzzy?  What do you look like?  We're heinous.  We're heinous.  We're heinous.  I imagine you are, and so you're so lashing out with rage.  That's what it is.  With rage you are.  Come on, boys.  Come on on to the set one day.  We're two just, you know, radio talk show hosts.  You shouldn't...  Don't be scared of me.  You shouldn't...  Don't be scared of me.  I'm not scared.  You're going to have Matthew punch us in the nose?  Matthew is so above punching you two in the nose.  Wow, we got to you. 
[02:50:30]  Who are we?  You're like a big, famous Hollywood star.  We're just two local shock sharks.  People actually are real people with feelings, and they work really hard.  And granted, am I a flawless person?  But no, do I go and fix it and become something else?  I'm not.  That's who I am.  Can we play What's in Sarah Jessica Parker's Pants right now?  It's a game we play.  I think it would be a good way to break the ice and make peace.  You take the phone.  Sarah?  And rub it on your most intimate of areas, and we guess how you're groomed.  Let me ask you a question. 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  Let me ask you a question.  I can't believe we got to.  I'm thinking, I'm thinking more.  You're just delighted to know...  You just made my day.  Aren't you guys just kind of delighted to know that when you actually trash someone,  that there's actually a person listening, and they have to be like...  No, I hate that.  You're not sort of cut off?  I hate that.  It hurts you guys.  We're going to have to reevaluate...  Does this kind of make you feel badly?  We're going to have to reevaluate the entire program now.  It kind of makes you feel like crap, doesn't it?  Honestly, no, it doesn't.  It's so easy to do.  No, Sarah, Sarah, if you'll let us talk, it doesn't change my opinion at all.  I don't care.  We're just trying to have fun and make people laugh.  We're just two local shock jocks. 
[02:51:30]  You're a Hollywood star, and we got to.  I'm not an Hollywood star.  I'm a New Yorker.  I've lived here my whole life.  Yeah.  I'm a working actress.  That's what I am.  You're not...  I dig.  I dig that you put me on the air.  Yeah.  I dig that you put me on the air, and I'm not saying you're not entitled to the first thing  I said.  I just want you to know there's a person.  There's a person attached.  Are you going to cry?  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm a grown woman.  She won't cry.  Maybe secretly we think you're really hot, and we're frustrated that we can't get you.  You guys want to come visit me?  Or not?  And we can't have sex with you or something.  We'll come visit you as long.  Sorry, don't go overboard. 
[02:52:00]  You guys want to come visit?  I'll come visit you as long as you don't get us beat up or anything.  No, I just want you to meet the crew, and I want you to meet everybody that I work with  all along.  Oh, that's going to just be ugly.  And we'll get all beat up.  It won't be ugly.  Why not come and be in my environment?  Come on, fellas.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere?  Neutral territory?  Yes.  Like Sweden?  Man, I'm starting to like you all of a sudden.  Like Sweden?  She's feisty.  You're feisty.  I like that.  Well, unattractive women tend to be feisty.  No, Ruth Fuzzy never gave me a boner.  You do. 
[02:52:30]  Okay?  Please, fellas, don't try to backpedal that much.  No, we're not backpedaling.  You're getting on the good side.  I wanted you to know that there's actually a human being connected with you guys.  I know it's funny, and I know it's charming, and it's amusing to the listeners, and I've  laughed at things in the past, too.  But I just wanted you to know there's a person.  That's all.  Opie's the mean one.  I'm nice.  I don't know which one's which, and I sort of don't care, because you guys sort of did  a tag team thing.  No, you care, because you called in.  I do care.  I do care.  So you just heard our voices in the background in between, you know, filming Sex and the 
[02:53:00]  City, and went, oh my God, they're talking about me?  Where were you when you heard us trashing you?  We're shitting downtown on Chamber Street.  Right.  In the surrogate court building, which means I'm surrounded by authority.  Right.  So anyway, I have to go to the set.  They're calling me to the set.  But I just wanted to...  Can we have all our listeners bring down flowers to apologize or something?  Hmm.  I want you two to bring down flowers.  They didn't do anything wrong.  They're just happy listeners.  Trust me.  I think...  Right?  Huh?  No, they're on our side.  They all feel the same way. 
[02:53:30]  You feel Jesus.  No, no, no, no.  Someone on line nine is calling us pussies.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You can't win.  Because now we're back, probably.  Thank you.  Thank you for letting me call.  You're men for listening.  I appreciate it.  And I'm dead serious when I say come down to the set and visit.  You don't have to come today.  We're shooting until mid-August.  We're here in New York City.  Could you hold on?  Our producer will just get info.  If you could just give it to somebody on that end, we'll try to figure something out.  I look forward to meeting you.  And I secretly do watch Sex and the City, even though I can't admit it on the radio show.  This is kind of a chick show.  No, it's not, man. 
[02:54:00]  And you are the hottest on the show.  The blonde, I don't like at all.  She was naked in the firehouse this week.  These are the people I work with.  I dig her.  I dig her.  Yeah, but...  She's trash-talking me.  I'm not going to jump on your side.  No, but I'm just giving my opinions again.  All right, but don't think I'm kidding.  She was naked through that whole first episode, and I wasn't feeling it.  I was hoping you were going to get naked with that politician, the controller.  I'll never get naked.  I never have, and I never will.  No?  It was pretty close last night on the movie awards.  All right, why don't you produce get the information so I can go to set and not get fired?  Okay.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:54:30]  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes, Sarah Jessica Parker, calling in.  Well, you know, she's got some balls there.  Comes calling up and defending herself.  Man, this show has come a long way.  You know, it used to be safe where we could trash people and it never gets back to them.  Yeah.  I think our audience is getting too big.  Yeah, we got to leave this city.  If we were in Tallahassee, you know, no one would care.  They go line to Sarah Jessica Parker.  I'm like, there's no way it's Sarah Jessica Parker.  It's Sarah Jessica Parker. 
[02:55:00]  Yelling at us.  Opie.  Yeah.  You should be a little nicer next time.  The scary part.  I bet you we go down there and we see her and we just go, oh, my God, she's knockout gorgeous.  She's so hot.  Yeah.  You know.  Oh.  She just made us eat crow, practically.  Screw the rat.  Yeah, I know.  It's so hard to just, because everyone can call up and say, you guys are pussies.  Why don't you, you know, it's one thing to say stuff on the air. 
[02:55:30]  It's another when they call up and call you on it to, like, keep going.  I think we held our own, though.  I didn't back down too much.  No, I totally pussied out.  I got to be honest with you.  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  I totally pussied out.  I do like her when her hair is down.  When she pulls it back, it's not as sexy, Anthony.  Yeah.  But we love Sex and the City, right, Ant?  It's one of my favorite shows.  I can't believe she heard us dressing her. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, are there any other celebrities listening today?  We'd love to hear from you, and we'll give you our opinion on you.  Yeah, and then you could rub it in our face.  Right.  God, we're just two dopey, like, local talk show guys, and we got to, like, a Hollywood starlet.  With our stupid opinions, Anthony.  Made it feel bad.  Yeah, see?  And I'll go on record to say Ant and I are nothing to look at.  We know that.  We never sit here on the radio and say, hey, you know, GQ called, and they want us for a photo shoot. 
[02:56:30]  But I'll tell you one thing.  If MTV Movie Awards called and wanted me to host, I wouldn't be strutting around in clothes,  just trying to look all hot, you know.  You just didn't like the MTV Movie Awards, and she was, what, the host?  She was the host, yeah.  And I think, and I still said she came across as a little stiff, I'll be.  Okay.  A little stiff.  Any other celebrities like to call up today?  We'd love to talk to you.  In her defense, she said that she doesn't do that by trade, 
[02:57:00]  and she thought it would be an exciting, fun thing to do, like hosting the MTV Movie Awards,  so she did it.  And who am I to say that she came off as stiff, Opie?  I think all next week we dedicate the ONA show to Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yes.  It'll be the We Love You Sarah Jessica all week next week.  Okay.  We can do that.  We'll get a skywriter.  We'll put a heart up over Central Park.  We'll get our listeners to send flowers down to the set.  Let's make up some bumpers saying that this week is the Sarah Jessica Parker Love Fest week. 
[02:57:30]  Love Fest week.  Oh, boy.  I didn't feel bad, though.  If she's listening, I didn't.  We're just trying to have fun and have some, make people laugh.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I heard her voice.  I knew that was her right away.  I felt guilty, man, for laughing at what you guys were saying.  I was like, holy mackerel.  I know.  It's very rare someone calls us out on something, and I'm like, there's no way that Sarah Jessica Parker will take time out of her busy day. 
[02:58:00]  She just hosted the, you know, movie awards, even though they taped that a while ago, but I'm sure she's doing press, post-press.  Yeah.  She's filming Sex and the City.  I'm like, there's no way she has time to call up because two wacky DJs in New York said something bad about her.  It's like telling your buddies you're with this chick, and all of a sudden she walks in her room and goes, oh!  We just got snagged is what happened.  We got snagged.  We were called out, and I, for one, folded.  I folded.  Oh, I hate that. 
[02:58:30]  They're not supposed to be real people.  They're just cagged.  Whatever.  Pete.  Yeah, you guys are such pussy, tripping over your own tampon strings as you're backpedaling, you two little women.  Hey, I got a good idea.  The next Sex and the City, maybe they can have all the girls bend you guys over and just rape the hell out of you women.  We'll be violated with strap-on devices on Sex and the City. 
[02:59:00]  Sex and the City has become one of our favorite shows right behind Survivor.  What a mess.  They're not supposed to call.  I'm like, there's no way a lady's going to, like, imitate Sarah Jessica Parker well.  I could tell by the voice.  Wait, wait, wait.  Rick just had a, did you talk to her or she put you on with someone else?  First, I got an earful from her.  What did she say to you on the phone after we hung up with her?  She asked if I was proud to be working for you guys.  Oh, God, see.  And I had to admit that, no, I wasn't, not at that particular moment.  Oh, you're a pussy, too. 
[02:59:30]  Look at you.  Hey, I learned from you guys.  Oh, we got off on the wrong foot with Sarah Jessica Parker.  Now we're going to have to make it up to her.  I'll be honest, I don't have the balls to go down to the set of Sex and the City and meet her.  Oh, have a bunch of hot chicks laughing at us.  Yeah, that's not emasculating at all.  Because we never claimed to be freaking, you know, models or anything.  Oh, no.  And you know Matthew's going to be there.  He's going to try to punch us in the nose because we trashed his woman.  Dude, can we get a couple of, like, GQ model guys to go down there as Opie and Anthony? 
[03:00:00]  Come on.  Come on.  That's perfect.  We'll pay him.  They'll be dressed to the nines and stuff.  Right.  Welcome.  Hello.  I'm Opie.  I'm Anthony.  How are you?  Sorry, Jessica.  So we've got to take a break, Anthony.  Okay.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Don't be an A-Hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go ask yourself, Opie.
