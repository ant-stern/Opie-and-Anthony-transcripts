<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off course.  It began with a song, followed by a segment featuring a caller, "Al," whose girlfriend demanded he get tested for Hepatitis before engaging in oral sex.  The hosts engaged in explicit and vulgar banter with Al about this, detailing his planned dramatic reveal of his test results.

Next, Sharon Osbourne joined the show as a guest.  The conversation centered on her husband Ozzy Osbourne, including stories about his career, personality, and a revenge prank involving eggs and peanut butter thrown at Iron Maiden's singer. Jimmy Norton's intense fandom of Ozzy and Black Sabbath was a recurring theme, showcased by his prized photo with the band and numerous anecdotes. Sharon also discussed managing Ozzy’s career, balancing family and work, and their reality TV show.  This transitioned into a discussion of a pee-wee football brawl video, prompting highly offensive commentary from the hosts and a female co-host.  The segment concluded with further discussions of Jimmy Norton's embarrassing Little League experiences and a listener called "Stalker Patty" and her online activities, including a PalTalk cam and a listener-funded charity that the hosts jokingly threatened to sue her over.

A subsequent segment featured a caller, Patty, whom Opie and Anthony guided through explicit adult webcam chat rooms, providing graphic descriptions of the acts onscreen, using racial slurs and homophobic language. This was followed by audio clips from "Dateline NBC's To Catch a Predator," with the hosts providing commentary and jokes.  Callers Jay from "Chocolate City," Kevin (a police officer), and John from Texas shared anecdotes, mostly unrelated to the Predator clips.  An Adam West voiceover was used in a promotional segment.  The segment ended with satirical, offensive political ads created by the hosts and callers, followed by a disturbing news story about a sexually assaulted developmentally disabled man, which prompted more sexually explicit jokes.

Another segment began with a discussion about a previous television appearance interrupted by a homeless man.  This led to a discussion with studio guests Uncle Al (drinking red wine) and Raven (bassist from Ministry and Killing Joke). Uncle Al recounted a bizarre story about his keyboard technician attempting to have sex with an ostrich at a zoo while on LSD.  The hosts and guests offered crude and humorous commentary.  The conversation then touched upon band names, gossip about Paul McCartney's wife, names for all-female punk bands, and graphic details about "Viber Strips," a sexual enhancement product.  Sunset Thomas and Rebecca Love (a pornographic actress) joined, discussing Rebecca's career, including a "Best Oral" nomination, and demonstrating sex toys, including "The Rabbit," with graphic descriptions and vulgar language.

A segment heavy on sexually explicit and vulgar content followed, including graphic descriptions of sexual acts and simulated sexual encounters.  A recorded audio clip of women engaging in sexually suggestive dialogue was played.  The hosts' commentary frequently targeted a cameraman with racially charged and derogatory terms.  A caller, Dawn, requesting a Tom Waits song, triggered a hostile exchange, with the hosts mocking her voice and sexuality with offensive insults.  Comedian Bill Burr then joined the show, shifting the conversation to firearms, hunting, conspiracy theories, the political conventions, the Olympics, and other topics, interspersed with crude humor and personal anecdotes.

The final segments started with an anecdote about a deceased acquaintance, quickly moving to a discussion of a man charged with holding five people hostage in Iowa, and then to a conspiracy theory about the Rothschild family’s control over the internet. This segued into another appearance by Bill Burr, beginning with a birthday gift exchange involving a bottle of rum with an offensive name.  Conversations covered cell phones, Burr’s new CD, Madonna’s physique, the presidential election, and an extended discussion of Roland’s tickling escapades with Poe (audio of this was mentioned).  The discussion then turned to Lil Wayne's "Lollipop,"  Run-DMC's "Rock Box,"  and racial and generational differences in musical preferences, with much crude humor.  Shaquille O’Neal’s freestyle rap about Kobe Bryant and the absurdity of women “saving themselves” for marriage concluded this segment.

The very last segment began with jokes about Hitler’s alleged sense of humor.  This quickly transitioned to a discussion about the closing of Shea Stadium and the Subway Series, leading to a phone call with Louis C.K.  The conversation with C.K. focused heavily on his dating life, vulgar language, and sexually explicit details about his sex life after his divorce.  The show then featured a woman who had been in a children's production of *Oliver!* attempting to sing "Consider Yourself," resulting in an awkward segment due to her accent and the hosts’ jokes.  Finally, a call from "Coke Logic," an animator from Chicago, led to a discussion of his work and unsolicited dating advice, punctuated by vulgar and sexually explicit commentary and the hosts’ encouragement for him to use his art to attract women.

[00:04:00]  La la la la  Line of the day  Line of the day  Wait a minute. You left like  Thursday. You haven't seen her in five days.  What could have been the problem?  Not many ways to say this. Al?  Oh boy.  I um  I  She won't eat my ass till I get tested for hepatitis.  And there is your line of the day. 
[00:04:30]  Alright.  Alright.  Alright. I gotta go because I'm going to  get my hepatitis test.  He wants his ass. How long does it take?  Once you get it done. A day or two.  A day or two. You better do  tongue push-ups, baby.  You got a fucking  tookus to clean. 
[00:05:00]  So you're calling her out.  Now you're going to get the test back by Friday.  What if  what if  what if  there's another excuse?  Then you'll know.  Like the fucking shit log hanging out?  That's what you get for waiting, toots.  Get in there and  chew your way  chew your way to paradise.  Get the test.  Comes back.  Okay.  And then you're going to like  scrub up  and then  what's the move?  I'm going to walk in.  Here's what I'm going to do.  This is what you're going to hear.  Listen.  Why do you have to actually 
[00:05:30]  pull your pants down?  You get to hear this.  Listen.  All right.  Lick, whore.  Throw that paperwork down.  Jim's going to present  like a mandrill.  Like a  present  that red ass.  I'll give her my fucking  pants down like this  and I'll just go  look  no diseases.  It's just  a really unpleasant  Oh my God. 
[00:06:00]  That would be my ass  yelling at her  for making it waste.  My ass just  has a mind of its own.  Oh Jesus.  Come on.  I got  let it happen.  Come on Jimmy.  This is making me sad.  That smells like a  hepatitis form.  This is making me sad.  What this?  The mental death.  Yes.  The girl said  whenever I have sadness  not even filtered  through the pants.  Happiness comes in  and pushes all my  sadness out.  You have the paperwork.  Yeah.  Now the pressure's on. 
[00:06:30]  Like  now it's like  here's paperwork  lick my ass.  That's why I did  that paper sort of thing.  Now what if  what if  are you going to ask  or are you going to  wait and see how many  days go by?  I'm going to pull him down  I'm going to bend over  and when she walks  in the room  I'm going to go  read it  and weep.  If she doesn't  she doesn't start  licking within  a week  a week  of the results.  When are you going to  let us know when she licks? 
[00:07:00]  You don't understand  something.  Yes.  The ink  you're still going to  be able to smell  fresh ink.  She's going to be  fucking  nose deep  and keister.  You're still going to  be able to smell  fresh ink.  You should make her  do it in the doctor's  office after you get  the results.  That's exactly  or in the cab  on the way home  in the fucking  dirty cab.  All you see is a  black face  leaning up  and two eyes  looking at her  in the fucking  rear view.  Me with my sweats  down.  I won't even lie  on my fucking  stomach.  I'll lie on my  back.  I'll lift my legs 
[00:07:30]  up and just  hoist my sweats  and go get  licking.  Here I am.  My fucking  clean bill of health.  Press together  like a pussy.  Eat it.  Get in there.  Why don't you  take a swan dive  into my dumper.  You're going  through a lot of  trouble to get your  ass eaten by your  chick.  I don't even know  she'll do it.  She didn't say she  would do it.  That's just it.  It might be.  Yeah.  The beauty of you  is you ran right  out to get that  test done.  Yeah.  So you're taking  away all the things  that might keep her  from doing it.  Here's what I'm 
[00:08:00]  going to do.  I'm going to  fucking, she's going  to walk in my room.  I'm going to go,  come in here,  it's an emergency.  And she's going  to walk in and  I'm going to be  fucking on my  stomach like on  the bed with my  asshole being held  open with my  hands and my  results on my  back.  So what she'll do  is she'll take a  quick peek and  then she'll find  she'll get down  there and little  Jimmy Norton will  reap the rewards.  Time to reap the  benefits. 
[00:08:30]  The results taped  to your back.  They'll be right  on my back like  a little fucking  end table.  Speaking of  ends, get in  there and let  little Jimmy reap  the rewards.  I'm just very  curious.  I'd like to ask  some questions  though.  What'll happen?  I understand you  want me to be  tested but I  never heard of  anyone getting  hepatitis on  their finger.  Hint.  Oh, just a  little diddle.  How about that?  Perhaps for a  starter kit.  Exactly.  The starter kit.  Let's work your  way up until you're  worried about  hepatitis on your 
[00:09:00]  wrist and then  I'll go get a  test.  Fuck, is this  bullshit?  Alright, it's  Brother Wheeze and  you're listening to  the worst of Opie and  Anthony.  The worst of Opie and  Anthony.  They call it  toilet humor.  Toilet humor.  Fast-paced show  today.  It's the Opie and  Anthony show.  The ONA virus  spreading across  America.  We got Sharon  Osborne in studio  smelling really,  really good.  Unbelievably good.  That's the first  thing we said to  her.  You smell good.  We're losers. 
[00:09:30]  We really are.  When it comes down  to it.  Is her mic on?  Make sure Sharon's  mic is on.  Yeah, I cranked it  up there.  Is it on?  Yeah, there you  go.  Well, she's very  soft-spoken.  I'm used to the  Sharon Osborne from  the show where you're  yelling and screaming  at everybody.  I'm still yelling and  screaming.  Just causing havoc  wherever you go and  then you come in and  you're very soft-spoken  and you smell nice and  you look beautiful.  I'm not going to do  anything wrong.  I'm just saying the  reason she's soft-spoken  is because usually if  she's yelling, she has 
[00:10:00]  a reason to.  Oh.  So we don't want to  get a reason.  Is that our goal to get  her to scream at us?  No, not mine.  It would be fun to get  yelled at by her.  No, it's too early in  the morning.  Come on.  Be nice.  I met Sharon one time  I was backstage at  OzFest.  Of course you were.  Of course, I had to  be.  And I was nervous  meeting you because  I guess people who have  been on the other end  of business deals with  you that weren't doing  what you liked have  stories that you don't  F around.  And I was kind of  nervous.  I'm like, I don't want  to say the wrong thing  and piss her off.  And you were so nice.  Look at the lovely hug 
[00:10:30]  you gave me.  You couldn't have  enjoyed that hug.  Oh, look.  Jimmy brought his  picture.  Yeah, she was very  sweet.  We should tell Sharon  that you're looking at  the biggest Ozzy fan  of all time.  Really?  And I'm sure you've  heard that a lot, but  I'm telling you, he's  obsessed.  He's almost a stalker.  No.  Almost a stalker.  When Ozzy was on our  show, he couldn't speak.  Look, he was looking  forward to this for so  long, and he just turned  into a blithering idiot.  Well, for the first 10  minutes, I just sat there  and we were at the XM 
[00:11:00]  side and Ozzy's on my  right.  And Anthony is great  because he can just  conduct an interview.  And I'm such a just a  starstruck ass.  And Ozzy's talking and  I'm like, hey, dope.  Ozzy is sitting next to  you.  We at least talked to him  and then I started talking  and he hung for like 45  minutes and then it worked  out okay.  I just kind of loosened up.  But yeah, I was nervous.  You're a little nervous.  So cute.  Turned into a little  kid.  But Ozzy is so unique.  He's so different.  Oh, yeah.  And he's hilarious.  Easy to talk to.  You guys talk to, you  know, a zillion people in  a day. 
[00:11:30]  But yet when he comes in  everything about him, his  body language, everything,  he is so unique.  And the best thing was it  was over there.  So he could talk in his  inimitable Ozzy style  without any restrictions.  Yeah, no bleepings whatsoever.  Wow.  Wow.  Quite the potty mouth.  But he loved it though.  Tony Dennis said that he  had a great time because he  could curse enough to worry  about like, you know, just  dancing around words.  He just said what he wanted  to say.  Jimmy doesn't acknowledge  that another band existed. 
[00:12:00]  We try to talk music on the  show.  It's all about Black Sabbath.  And you try to bring up,  God forbid you bring up  Zeppelin or something.  Excuse me, he has good  taste.  Well, yeah, I'm trying to get  her on my side.  I'm an idiot.  I don't think you have to  sell her on Ozzy.  Yeah, good point.  I wanted to ask you too,  obviously, this really  irritated me that there was  at OzFest that, and I  loved you for doing this,  Iron Maiden, like Dickinson  had been bad-mouthing  Sabbath.  I mean, was he actually  bad-mouthing the band?  Because I know it got  really ugly between the  two camps.  He was bad-mouthing.  I mean, come on, these 
[00:12:30]  guys, you know, are  English.  We've, you know, we've  crossed paths over the  years for like 20-odd  years.  And he came on.  We paid them a fortune  to come on.  We were, you know, really  nice.  with them, gave them  whatever they wanted, and  every single night, not  Sabbath, but Ozzy, he took  pot shots at Ozzy on  stage.  And at first, Ozzy and I  thought it was a joke.  So, you know, you know how  guys, you know, you joke  with each other, and we're  like, okay, he's joking. 
[00:13:00]  And it went on and went on  and on.  And I just thought, okay,  carry on.  You want to play, you pay.  Nice.  And so when they got to L.A.,  which is like, you know, oh,  L.A., and there's 50-odd  thousand kids there.  And I thought, right, pay  back.  And so I had, I had like 20  guys in the front with eggs,  great big jars of peanut butter  mixed in with dog food, milk to  make it really wet, everything. 
[00:13:30]  And they pelted him.  Good.  And I thought, you know what,  kid, laugh at that.  You know, you don't, you don't  take somebody's money and take  their stage and then be  discourteous.  To me, that just doesn't, it  just doesn't go.  You know, if you've got  something to say about someone  you're working with, say it,  get it over with, move on.  I heard the rest of the band  was embarrassed, too.  I mean, they said, I think, I  think I asked Tony Ombi one  time, and he said that the  rest of the band was kind of 
[00:14:00]  coming up going, look, that's  not, that's him.  The other guys, I must say,  were very, very nice, great  guys, you know, but that  singer has a problem.  He has a real big problem.  Very big, you know, inflated  ego.  And he just, you know, is  discourteous.  But he got it back.  I was at the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame induction.  I hijacked the press  conference because these dumb  reporters are just going to  ask stupid reporter  questions.  I know.  And I sat in the second row,  and my goal was to, like,  talk to Sabbath and ask 
[00:14:30]  questions and get a photo  while I was talking to them.  So I stand up when they come  out, and I'm asking  questions, and I'm, like,  trying to angle and get a  picture.  And all these dumb  reporters are yelling,  sit down, sir, could you  sit down, could you sit  down?  And you're like, no, I  want my picture.  Oh, they just didn't exist,  and it was great asking them  real fan questions.  Yeah.  All these idiots want to know  about is the next album,  and some stupid bat joke,  and they're just a bunch of  scumbags.  These, you know, like,  I know.  Rolling Stone magazine type of  critic vibe really  irritated me.  And I don't know where I'm  going with this.  I just wanted to tell you  that. 
[00:15:00]  Just showing that you are  pretty much a stalker.  No, no, I've never done  anything unhealthy.  I've never showed up  someplace I shouldn't.  I don't hang outside the  fence and peek in.  It was the greatest photo  you ever got because you got  the whole band.  That was his goal.  It really is.  He set it up for weeks.  We had to hear about it,  and he got, he planned it  perfectly, and it worked out  for him.  And it's not, do you know  what?  It's not that easy to get  them all together and do a  photo with them.  You know, it's so rare that  they are all together at one  time.  And, you know, the one thing 
[00:15:30]  you know, I mean, how great  is it's the only band from  that era that's all still  alive and still can play  great.  I went back.  I snuck back after the  interview, and I talked to  Ozzy for a second, and I'm  like, I'd like to get a  picture with the band.  He's like, sure, man.  You know, relaxed he is.  But the other band, the band  was still signing, and he  had to go, so he's walking  away, and then I only comes  out, and I had met him that  day.  I'm like, I want to get a  picture.  So, like, he's like, hey,  Ozzy, let's just do the  picture.  So, it's him, Ozzy, it's  Tony, it's me, and then it's 
[00:16:00]  Geezer, and then Bill is just  taking his time, and I'm  like, Bill starts walking  out.  I'm like, Bill, hurry up.  Come on.  Come on.  And he runs.  Bill runs over, and he  looks like, who are you?  He just, why am I running  for you?  He just realized that there's  nobody.  There's this legendary band  with their trophies, and me,  and I'm hustling Bill  Ward along.  Come on, come on.  We're new to the picture.  I screamed at him, like,  Bill, come on, and he just  ran.  Jimmy has given us hours of  joy over his obsession with  Black Sabbath and Ozzy, so.  Obsessed.  Yeah, and he even says, he  even says how much he liked  the Ozzy with the big, poofy 
[00:16:30]  hair.  Yeah.  Back in the day.  It was kind of a...  Back in the day.  Even Sharon didn't like that  period.  I don't.  Listen, believe me, I get so  much grief from my kids when  they look at those pictures  and go, Mom, what did you do  to let him out of the  house like that?  Yeah.  The shot in the dark?  The shot in the dark era?  Yeah, of course.  The painted, the black  painted fingernails and  toenails.  Yeah, I mean, it was  all right.  It was, hey, look, it was  right after, it was like  the hairband vibe.  You had to do what you  had to do.  Oh, by the way, here is  the picture that Jimmy got 
[00:17:00]  that night.  Come on, I want to...  Look at that.  I mean, you want to talk  about that?  Is that a great shot,  though?  That's fantastic.  Is that a beautiful picture?  Like, what are the odds  you're going to get in a  picture like that unless  you're, you know, close  to the band or stalking  them or have guns pointed  at them?  They're all holding  their trophies.  It couldn't be better.  Now, the next thing is  you've got to get it  signed.  I was going to try that.  I actually, when you  guys were at the rock  and roll, you had the  hard rock promoting your  charity.  Of course, self-centered  ass I am.  I'm not thinking about  the charity.  I'm not thinking about  doing good.  I'm like, could you get  that picture signed?  But it was impossible. 
[00:17:30]  You are self-centered ass.  You're going to have to  wait until, when is it?  2008 until they do their  40th anniversary tour and  then they'll come in  and sign it.  That's fine.  We'll wait.  Yeah, we can wait.  I blew that up.  I have a copy of that  on my wall.  It's obnoxious.  I love watching Jim.  Do you know how big I  blew it up?  I'm embarrassed.  I'm 38 years old.  Do you see these squares  on the wall?  Honestly, that's how big  it is on my wall.  I have to bring women  over and explain why a  grown man.  Bless you.  Sharon, I hope you  understand.  He's a very successful 
[00:18:00]  comic.  He was on Lucky Louie on  HBO.  His career is going very  well.  He comes on stage in front  of massive audience to  some Black Sabbath music.  Oh yeah, I walk on to  A National Acrobat.  Even though he's  wearing a Kiss shirt  today, I'm sorry about  that.  I had to.  It would have been too  wormy if I showed up  in an Aussie shirt and  pointed.  Hi, Sharon.  See, you even thought  about that today.  I certainly did.  It's my wardrobe.  He's always thinking.  And I told Sharon when  she walked in, I'm  reading the book and I  really want to read it  because I'm very  interested.  And it's really, the  first thing, the most  amazing thing I learned  so far is that Ozzy is  a morning person. 
[00:18:30]  I had no idea he  actually gets up early  and enjoys getting up  early.  You would never actually  think that.  He opens his eyes and  then, boom, he's out  of bed.  He doesn't like, you  know, stretch and, you  know, a little chat.  Literally, up, eyes open,  gone.  You know, in the shower.  I'm like, how do you  do that?  You know, like, relax  five minutes and then  get up.  No, gone.  And he's, you know,  roaming around 6.37  every day.  And it seems already  like the book is 
[00:19:00]  already getting, it's  like, it's really  honest.  And Sharon, when she  walked in, we talked  about, I love the fact  that your show and the  Osbournes was,  it wasn't surface  honest.  It wasn't like, oh, we  had an argument once.  I mean, it was, it got  into you being sick and  it got into Ozzy's.  It got into, like, really  heavy, like, family  things.  Was there anything that  you guys, like, revealed  that you kind of wished  you didn't reveal?  No, because I think  that's what makes us  kind of different.  You know, not only was  Ozzy the first celebrity  to actually, you know,  let cameras into his  home, but, you know, 
[00:19:30]  he's so honest, he's  incapable of being, you  know, oh, let's set up  this idea and let's set  up that, you know.  Ozzy can't do that.  He's incapable of doing  that.  So everything you saw is,  you know, natural and  organic and, you know,  it's pure.  And I think that's what  sets it aside from  everybody else that's  trying to do it.  You know, you watch any of  those shows now and it's  like, oh, stop.  It's so badly acted.  I know.  It's like, what made you  think you were an actor?  I know.  That you can script this 
[00:20:00]  out and make it look  legit.  You know, it gets  embarrassing with some of  them.  You kind of get like, you  know, when you get like,  yeah, you can't watch it.  If there's other people in  the room, you can't look  at each other.  I get embarrassed.  We call that the  douche chills.  Yeah.  It's the worst.  But he's, you know, we  don't regret anything.  You can't.  Do you miss it, though?  Do you miss taping the  show and all that and  having all those people  around?  I miss the family being  together, you know, right  before it ended.  It was the time that the  kids were actually, you  know, moving out. 
[00:20:30]  So it was a huge life  change for Ozzy and I,  you know, to have that  house.  That's odd that you're  really like.  I don't think the viewer  really put it in that  perspective.  Like, wow, you're  watching your kids grow up  to the point where  they're ready to leave  the nest and that's it,  you know.  And it's really strange,  you know, to come in and  you're used to having  kids coming in and out  all night long and, you  know, and then suddenly  there's nothing and you  go home and there's Ozzy  and I sat at a big table  having dinner and we say, 
[00:21:00]  oh, let's go have it on  the tray in the kitchen and  we go back in the kitchen  and it's us, you know.  I mean, it's great.  It's just a new chapter of  your life, you know.  It's very different.  Yeah.  Been a big adjustment or?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I keep going  over to my kids' homes and  buying them ridiculous  things for the house.  Excuse to go there.  I must love that.  No, they don't.  It's like, oh, please,  would you stop it?  You're smothering me.  I'm like, I'm sorry.  Is it things that they need  or just kind of things that  you like and like that you 
[00:21:30]  give them like?  Things that I think they  need and I like and I take  it there and they're like,  thanks, Mom.  You know, like I take over  a big pink fluffy cushion  to Jack's house.  Thanks, Mom.  You know, as soon as I go,  it's in like the cupboard.  I just give it to a girl.  Like, look what I got you.  Yeah, you know that.  Exactly.  I want to ask you  something else, too.  I'm so annoyed.  About the book?  Come on.  No, it wasn't about the book.  It was about something  that wasn't the book.  I'm so stupid.  I love the book, though. 
[00:22:00]  I'm very happy.  I'm very nervous talking to Sharon.  I just like watching you squirm.  I love you.  Look at his shoulders.  They're like this.  After the other day,  I'm loving this, Jimmy.  I've never seen Jimmy  with his shoulders way up like this.  They're all hunched up.  He's like all tense.  Just talking to my friend Sharon.  What's wrong with that?  I happen to love her husband.  But, you know, so what?  I like her, too.  The fact is,  this is what bugs me.  A lot of people don't understand  that Sharon,  and I'm not saying this  just because you're here,  I mean, Ozzy's talent  is responsible for a lot of it,  but you're responsible for... 
[00:22:30]  You made Ozzy...  You kept him relevant  through so many tough periods  of music,  like all through the hair bands,  all through grunge.  Oh, the grunge.  Don't remind me of the grunge.  Jeez.  But he stayed.  He's stuck.  He did.  And Ozfest...  How close was it  to getting him  to wear a flannel?  Did you think about it?  Never, ever, ever.  You know,  they don't do flannel in black.  Right, right, right.  And you couldn't see Ozzy in check.  You were able to get  his hair poofy.  I was just thinking  maybe a flannel. 
[00:23:00]  No, no, no.  That would be pushing it  to extreme there.  No, I could never do that.  I mean,  can you imagine Ozzy  in those short trousers  and coming in  with a check shirt?  The jams on.  Yeah.  Give me a break.  What did you think  of the grunge movement?  You know...  It was better  than the hair bands.  Better than the hair bands.  You know,  love Nirvana,  love Pearl Jam,  and then I can't remember  anyone else.  Alice in Chains?  Alice in Chains,  yeah, you're right.  Love them.  My son's favorite band. 
[00:23:30]  I mean,  we love them.  And we're trying  to get them  on OzFest next year.  Oh, with the new singer?  No, with the old one.  Actually, what the hell  did you think?  We're going to dig him up.  Yeah, right.  They're playing  Philadelphia tonight.  I might go down there  and check it out.  The Electric Factory.  I'm hearing nothing  but great things  about this new singer.  They're really great.  Yeah.  Hey, did you and your dad,  I know your dad,  Don Arden,  had managed Black Sabbath,  and I don't know  if that's how you met Ozzy or not,  but did you guys,  I know,  had a lot of conflict 
[00:24:00]  over when you started  to manage him, right?  Yeah, a lot of conflict  because when I started  a relationship with Ozzy  and my dad knew  that we were going  to get married,  he knew that it was time  for me to go  and I would go  and I would take Ozzy,  which means his financial,  you know,  state would be affected  because he wouldn't  have Ozzy anymore  and my dad,  you know,  it's not like,  oh, my daughter's married.  Fantastic.  It's like, 
[00:24:30]  you know,  stay,  I want the money,  don't go,  and it was,  everything's about money.  Well,  it was about money  with my father.  And did it ever,  like,  get resolved  or did you end  everything on bad terms?  No,  it was horrible.  He never saw my children,  my mother never saw  my children,  my brother,  but eventually I heard  that my father was sick  and so five years ago,  I,  four or five years ago,  I met with my father  and I take care of him now.  He's old. 
[00:25:00]  Oh,  he's still alive?  I don't know why  I thought he passed away.  Okay.  No,  he's still alive.  He's 80.  Wow.  So things are a little bit  better at least.  Well,  he has Alzheimer's  so he doesn't know  who I am  and I,  but I take care of him,  you know,  you,  you,  um,  you have to forgive  but you don't forget.  You know,  you can't,  you can't go through life  holding all that.  You know,  you've got to let it go.  Is it tough being,  I mean,  I've just been asked  this a million times,  but to be a wife  and a manager,  I mean,  it's like,  I mean,  it's just,  it's constantly together. 
[00:25:30]  It's,  everything is together.  Is there any like times  where you just like,  you wish you weren't the manager?  I mean,  obviously you want to be married.  Sure.  I mean,  very,  very tough.  Excuse me,  are you watching porn on there?  No.  Oh,  I thought she was  covering herself with that.  You know what?  She's,  she's spilling out her heart.  I'm not going to have  some porn on there.  No,  she's,  she's,  she's reaching deep for us  and then she notices  that I might be watching porn.  I took down any,  anybody that might have been,  uh,  doing anything.  These are our listeners, 
[00:26:00]  a few of them,  and they pop up,  they can see us,  we can see them.  Very interactive.  Okay.  And they comment on what's going on  on the show  and ask questions,  things like that.  No,  no,  no,  because it,  you know,  any other day you'd be right.  It would have been some nude girl up there,  but I'm being respectful.  Not today.  It's going back to your question.  It's,  it's very hard at certain times  when you,  you know,  you want your artist to do something, 
[00:26:30]  but you don't want your husband to do it.  And,  but it's all one.  So it's,  it,  they were very hard times  at certain points,  you know,  certain points.  When I say in the book,  when Ozzy wasn't well,  but he had to go on stage  and I made him.  And,  you know,  you feel so bad.  You know,  what do you do?  It's like nine o'clock at night.  The audience have been there all day.  There's thousands of kids.  And if anyone would go on stage  and say,  well,  actually you can go home now  because he's not performing.  He's not well. 
[00:27:00]  It would have been riot.  People would get hurt.  So you weigh it up.  What do you do?  What do you do?  I don't think you had a choice.  You've taken a huge amount of heat for that though.  Huge.  From people.  Yeah.  That have just said,  oh,  look,  she's,  you know,  throwing them out on stage  and,  and the poor guy didn't feel well.  Yeah.  And,  you know,  what do you do?  Because I've,  I've been there.  I've done it.  We've canceled shows on the day  and,  you know,  kids don't like it  and they've been out in the sun all day.  They've been drinking  and they,  you know,  they paid,  they paid their money. 
[00:27:30]  They want to see them.  And,  you know,  it gets pretty ugly.  Those times,  but we don't have to do that anymore.  Is the small,  my husband's well.  Was the small stage a nice switch?  I was so irritated.  I was away doing gigs.  I,  I missed the small stage performance.  That must have been a great change.  It was amazing.  It was so fantastic.  Ozzy's going to do it again next year.  Oh,  good.  Loved,  loved being out there at like four in the afternoon.  And,  you know,  just,  he,  he was so happy doing it.  Home by seven o'clock. 
[00:28:00]  Oh,  luxury.  How disgusted were you?  I know,  and don't blame me.  You were talking about Cardinal O'Connor and all these,  these devil accusations and all that stuff.  That stuff seems to have kind of like faded away over the years.  Like all that nonsense around him.  I think,  you think it's since the show that like all those dumb rumors that would circulate just kind of like,  kind of fell by the wayside and people don't.  Yeah.  I mean,  um,  middle America people that didn't understand the genre of music that Ozzy was into,  um,  didn't understand and believed everything they read. 
[00:28:30]  And,  you know,  it's like a Chinese whisper,  you know,  he bit the head off a bat.  No,  actually he ate a baby.  So,  you know,  it just,  you know,  snowballs.  And people now,  you know,  see Ozzy as,  he's just a lovable guy.  You know,  he's,  he's a great guy.  And so he sings about the darker side of life.  You know,  you can't sing about,  you know,  happy shiny people all day.  It's boring.  Bravo on that.  Did you want to just smack him in the head with that ATV, 
[00:29:00]  uh,  accident?  I mean,  like,  what are you doing?  Do you,  do you,  do you,  are you a little more protective of him now?  And,  and he comes up with some harebrained idea that he wants to do.  And you just go,  look,  what are you doing?  No,  it,  all of that,  the bikes.  Cause he had a whole collection of dirt bikes and all these different things.  And the guns and the,  that I'm like,  no,  no more.  No,  you're done.  I can't take it anymore.  No,  over.  Yeah.  Done.  I want you to buy him.  Here's what I want you to put him in. 
[00:29:30]  So all as well,  I want you to just like one of those big things,  like with rubber balls that kids bounce in.  Yeah,  exactly.  Nothing that can fall off of.  Nothing that will get gigs canceled.  I need to see Sabbath again.  He's always been accident prone.  If there's something that's going to happen,  it will happen to Ozzy.  You know,  he goes in a shower,  slips down,  broken,  breaks the leg.  Oh gosh.  Every time he is so accident prone.  Wait,  are they cutting us off?  Yeah,  we got to get out of here.  We are on a timed thing because there's another show that comes in after us. 
[00:30:00]  How dare they?  I don't like it.  Tell them to go away.  And you look beautiful.  Thank you.  Absolutely beautiful.  Stunning.  Thank you,  Sharon.  We're really happy you came in.  Wish you had more time with us.  I'll come back.  She'll come back.  Sharon Osbourne,  everyone.  Thank you,  Sharon.  Hi,  this is Sharon Osbourne  and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's a mad house.  We got to calm down,  man.  I got to tell you right now.  The worst.  The worst.  I am the worst. 
[00:30:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It is the worst.  The fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life.  Hey,  we got the video of the day.  It's time for that story about Pee Wee football brawl.  Oh,  that's great.  You saw that?  I saw some of the footage on CNN.  Pee Wee football and,  yeah,  there's a huge brawl in the middle of the game.  Oh,  look at that.  Thank you.  And Steve Bartlestein and Laurie Stokes are disgusted.  Are they?  Steve Bartlestein is disgusted. 
[00:31:00]  Disgusted.  Good sportsmanship was not exactly on display.  This is,  this is really awful in a Pee Wee football game.  We've seen this before too.  The kids were misbehaving badly,  but the dads right here,  five and six year old players watched.  Another brawl involving parents breaking out on a field in Corpus Christi.  It began when a coach was tossed out of the game by an 18 year old referee.  Coach punched the ref,  knocked him unconscious.  18 year old.  Oh,  look at this.  Did you see?  Oh,  this is ugly.  This is just bad. 
[00:31:30]  Some parents tackle the coach to keep him away from the kids.  Charges are pending against the coach.  Man.  Dude.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Disgusting.  And another adjective?  Uh,  horrible.  There you go.  Why don't you get a hold of yourselves?  It's not 9-11 footage.  Yeah.  It's a bunch of parents fighting.  Brawling.  But she,  she got a little feisty with him there.  Yeah.  What'd she say?  Another adjective?  Uh,  horrible.  That was kind of like,  all right,  we get it.  We get it.  It's bad.  Shut the fuck up. 
[00:32:00]  Disgusting.  Deplorable.  Horrible.  Wouldn't it be funny if he just fired out other adjectives that made no sense,  and she's like,  you know,  other adjectives?  It's just cunty and niggerish.  It's dog shittable.  Eh,  what are you gonna do?  Parents are fighting out there.  What can I tell you?  Well,  that's why I hate kids sports,  because the parents,  the parents really are just a bunch of fucking,  just disgraceful jizz buckets.  It's fucking showing their own dick size for the accomplishments of their children. 
[00:32:30]  It really is awful.  No.  Horrible.  No.  Disgusting.  No.  Disturbing.  Hard to deal with.  Watching Dick Clark talk.  Next one.  Wouldn't it be funny if she should get another adjective if he wanted cute?  In general,  Jimmy,  because I do go to-  General Jimmy,  win the promotion.  Well,  I was Corporal Jimmy,  and then I went to military school 
[00:33:00]  and became General Jimmy.  I gotta salute this motherfucker now.  You certainly do.  But it's like with the short salutes,  like the Nazis would give,  like with the foot stomp,  and the little arm goes up and high.  How are you busy?  I like that one.  Hey,  we're busy killing people.  I ain't got time for all this formal crap.  Kid sports,  not as bad as you think.  You get a video like this every once in a while,  but,  you know,  the parents are behaving out there.  It's not fair to say that all the parents are out of control.  I was just saying a lot of them.  No,  it's a little more of that culture of fear thing.  In general, 
[00:33:30]  there's a lot of behaving going on.  What is happening,  though,  is like the mom's bringing the snacks for the kids.  Aw,  that's adorable.  And giving the kid a little juicy box.  Sunny D?  In the dugout,  in between innings.  Yeah.  You didn't play sports growing up really,  right,  Ant?  No.  We didn't have any of that when we were growing up playing sports.  Right.  You didn't have your mom cuddling you in between innings  with little,  little,  little,  little like sandwiches and snacks.  When I was playing Little League,  when I was playing in the Little League baseball, 
[00:34:00]  if I wanted to drink,  I had to suck my mother's pussy in the ass.  Holy shit,  Jimmy.  Oh my lord.  At least she was there for you.  That's right.  It's nice.  I was a pitcher when I was a kid,  and I was just fucking dumping.  Catch her now.  Damn it,  you beat me to it.  Power bottom.  Are you trying to say I topped from the bottom?  Now a pitcher as an adult,  yeah.  I was,  I was a pitcher on Young's Glass Service.  No,  on the Royals. 
[00:34:30]  The Royals.  Yes.  Yeah.  And?  How'd you do?  I've been better.  Yeah,  you are.  I had a really weird pitching style.  Instead of winding up,  I was,  I did it like,  I would be on the mound,  and I would step back  up,  and then forward.  Like,  I would just take a step back.  I wouldn't even wind up.  It wasn't even a good wind up.  You didn't have a good leg lift,  and it was just kind of  backwards,  forwards.  You're going to add an extra  one billionth of a mile per hour  to your pitch?  I had no,  I remember I walked, 
[00:35:00]  they had such high hope for me  as a pitcher.  Mr. Ryan thought I was going to be  a great pitcher.  Mr. Ryan was a boob.  He certainly was an ass.  And I didn't do,  I did particularly well in one game,  like against one or two hitters.  But then they started me,  and I think I walked like seven people  in a row,  and they had to yank me.  That no insight asshole.  He was awful.  Wow.  Ball four!  Mother's cunt.  Ball four!  I had a fire.  Just pull me already. 
[00:35:30]  Ball!  Ball!  Come on.  Get me out of here,  I'm dying here.  Best effort,  ball four!  Bases are loaded,  no outs.  How do I get out of this?  I could do this.  Strike!  Yes!  Fucking pulling it together.  Ball four!  What a bases walking bag of shit.  You could actually hear,  da-dung, da-dung,  da-dun, da-dun, da-dun,  da-dun.  They were playing merry-go-round music.  That's like going around the bases. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, it was fucking awful.  I turned around,  and all the players  had a fucking stick  coming through their backs  and through their chest  like they were  on a carousel.  The carousel  of fat,  no self-esteem, boy.  Ball four!  Strike!  The occasional torture  of strike.  That's right.  It's three and one.  Let's go to Randy  in Houston.  Randy.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, Randy.  I was going to say,  I was kind of raised 
[00:36:30]  how I hope you was.  When you were a kid  and you were playing  Little League,  if you wanted  a goddamn drink,  you had to wait  to the end  of the damn nine innings.  If you were injured,  get out there  and fucking play.  That was my dad's stance.  Yeah, because my nephew,  J.D.,  is big into the baseball there,  and I've gone to  a lot of the games,  and you see a lot  of athletes,  but you see these moms,  and they're just  hanging around the dugout,  handing food to their kid  in the dugout.  J.D. doesn't get the food  and the juices, really,  for the most part. 
[00:37:00]  They want to be part of it.  It's all about snacks,  and it's just a fun day  out for everybody.  It's not a sport anymore  in some ways.  Well, isn't that kind of...  Kids are trained  to be pussies now.  I don't know.  I've got to say one thing.  Isn't that...  It's like we're  kind of knocking that,  but it's like...  It was funny  the way Ope just said that.  Yeah, it's just a fun day out.  Like, yeah,  I guess that is kind of  what it's supposed to be  for kids.  Like, you're having snacks  and hitting the ball.  But the way you said that,  like, ah, little cunts 
[00:37:30]  just trying to have fun  and enjoy their day.  I'm the Bobby Knight  of the peewee league.  Just displaying sportsmanship  and the like.  No, it's...  All right.  Father should go over there  and punch her in the face.  Dude, there's a difference.  When you get your friends together,  you go to the schoolyard,  you hit the ball around,  you try to get a game together,  whatever.  It's a fun day out.  But organized sports,  it's...  You know,  you shouldn't have mommy  like hanging out  on the dugout  without asking if you want  some, you know,  animal crackers.  Juicy.  And a juice box.  My mother never did that stuff.  My mother was actually... 
[00:38:00]  My mother was on the fence  holding onto it,  shaking it,  going,  swing by the swing!  She was really embarrassing.  She'd go,  no batter,  no batter,  no batter,  while I was up at the plate.  We want a pitcher,  not a belly  that likes to have shit on it.  She'd be on the fence  trying to rally the other team.  Were you easy out guy?  Yeah,  one play.  Easy out.  And I would fucking,  the worst would be like,  I'll show you guys.  I'll show you. 
[00:38:30]  Swing!  Foul tip.  Ball goes nowhere.  It's not a good foul tip.  It's I barely got a piece.  And the ball would just like limply,  like my cock in adulthood,  just bounce off the plate.  And technically,  it wasn't a fucking miss.  And the coach would go,  good swing, Jimmy.  Just try to encourage me.  Good swing.  Good swing.  Good piece of the ball.  Yeah.  And it wasn't a good piece of the ball.  No.  That's how bad I was.  I would take solace in my outs.  Hey,  when you were walking to the plate,  did the pitcher turn around  and give the sign of everyone moving? 
[00:39:00]  Everyone,  come on in.  Yeah.  Move in, everyone.  No,  closer.  Closer.  The umpire would do that.  The fucking,  they would actually pick the fences up  and move them in.  Center fielder's now playing second base  when Jimmy's up.  That was awful.  I told you the time that I fucking,  I was up at the plate  and I hit a little dribbler foul  up the first baseline  and it was just foul  and I stood there limply  and they're all yelling,  run,  run it out.  And I was like,  but the ball's foul.  Run it out.  And I just stood there 
[00:39:30]  and then it went fair.  Oh, no.  And as the guy picked it up,  I started running  and I got three feet.  I got three feet from home plate.  Oh,  hold on a second.  Let me just get the phone here  because, you know,  people who don't know me.  Are you the worst?  Yeah,  I, uh,  That is funny.  I got three feet away from home plate  and they threw me out  and I had to turn around  and walk back to the dugout.  Old chubby,  my fucking uniform was untucked.  Would you have made it  if you started running 
[00:40:00]  right when you hit?  Oh, I might have.  Yeah.  If I just, yeah.  Yeah, if you actually  did what you were supposed to do.  Or I would have at least  looked like I was running it out  but I stood there limply  while they all screamed,  run, run it out.  No, no, it's foul.  And I just stood there  like with my arms out  like what?  I don't want to run it out.  It's a foul ball.  A little panicky Pete  when it takes that turn.  And it hit the grass  and it went  right back in  and as the guy picked it up,  I just started hustling it out  like the miracle was going to come.  You hit a frunkus. 
[00:40:30]  The ball went frunkus.  Oh, what an ass.  God, that's funny.  I remember one game  I was so bad  they moved me  from position to position.  I started out in right field  and they moved me  in a third bag.  Oh, I was awful.  And some kid tried  to steal third  and they threw it to me  and the ball just like  my glove stood there  and the ball just went  left of my glove  and he ran home.  Oh, what a fucking  impotent mess I was.  There are certain people  that you know  wherever they are positioned 
[00:41:00]  the second  he has to come into play.  It's like  because it's happening so fast  but your mind is working  real quick  and you're like  oh, we're fucked.  Oh, we're fucked.  And there goes the ball  to throw  and he fucking missed it.  One year  I actually wasn't  the worst hitter.  I would do okay.  And this is probably  what am I?  I mean, I'm 38  and this is probably  when I was 13  25 years ago.  And I still remember  my dad overheard  some black kid  on the team  complimenting me  and he told me about it.  The kid's name  was Andy Blocker. 
[00:41:30]  Andy Blocker?  And he said  that Jimmy's one  of the better hitters  on this team.  And my dad reported  that to me  and I never forgot it.  I was one of the  better hitters  on that team.  And I wasn't.  Very nice of that.  Yes, it was me  and Rick Allen  and Christopher Reeve  were the three hitters  and I was one  of the better ones  behind only those two.  I want to start  a new bit.  Clean up hitter.  You got to clean up  Christopher Reeve's shit.  And Heather Mills  where she would just  put pine tar  on her thigh  and swing it.  Oh my God.  I don't know  why that makes sense.  She only has one leg. 
[00:42:00]  That makes more sense  if you have two.  Mike and Jerry's Mike.  Asshole I am.  Mike.  Hey, what's up guys?  Hey.  Hey.  First at bat,  peewee.  Like the first year  you could play baseball.  Hit right in the head  by a pitch.  I must have stood  a foot and a half  away from the plate  every time I went  to bat after that.  I could not  get into it after that.  Scared you away.  All right.  Hey.  Yeah, I never liked  that being brushed  back shit.  It's the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Anthony had a very  good observation.  This pal talk 
[00:42:30]  is taking over  this radio program.  This radio show  used to be just  a four hour experience.  Now it's just  around the clock.  Yep.  The Opie and Anthony  experience continues  around the clock.  When the show ends  you can go on pal talk  or numerous message boards  or anything  and it continues.  The relationship  between the listeners  and the program  continues.  And they're hanging out  at my brother's place.  It's like a whole thing  that's going on.  They have a hangout  online, a hangout  if they want to be  part of the real world.  But what I'm getting  at here, you notice 
[00:43:00]  that Stalker Patty  has a pal talk camera.  I'm looking.  I see Stalker Patty  up there.  On the corner.  Yeah.  Off center.  Her whole place  is a corner.  I just looked at it.  It's awful.  It's horrid.  It's a horrid  little cracker box  she lives in.  And yeah, Patty  has a camera  and an account.  And if you notice  she's got a green account  which means that  that's the one  that you pay  full price for.  You get all of the  benefits of being  a full paid member 
[00:43:30]  of pal talk  and a camera.  Now recently  we had  our listeners  had put a charity  together because  Patty was going to be  kicked out of her  apartment.  She was back  she had a bunch  of back payment  to make on the rent  and the listeners  came up with a bunch  of cash and gave  her money.  Yes.  Which we made her  earn by crawling  on her hands and knees  naked through  mousetraps  blindfolded  until she found  the checks.  It was fabulous.  So she got 
[00:44:00]  the money  and apparently  spent a little bit  of it I see  at least on  a camera  and an account.  I think she uses  us to be  quite frank.  Look at her.  Now she's holding  up her cat.  She's got her cat  in there but  I think maybe  misappropriation  of funds.  That's right.  I think perhaps  we should  sue to get it  back now.  Let's contact  the SEC.  And we can  have the money 
[00:44:30]  taken away.  Please sue Patty.  Someone go and  confiscate her camera.  Oh please sue her.  That would be  the greatest story.  Why are you suing me?  A charitable event  to raise money for her  and she's buying  luxury items.  That's right.  It's a luxury item  Pal Talk.  It certainly is.  She's living  high on the hog.  Patty are you  doing other things  besides just  Opie and Anthony  fan rooms?  Here on Pal Talk  do you go into  some of the sexy 
[00:45:00]  rooms that they  have?  That's what I  want to know.  She's looking for  the virgin witches.  Put your cat down  and type you ass.  You know that  Pal Talk camera  is technically ours.  I think E-Rock  should go over there  and just take it.  Take the camera!  No!  No!  Here she is.  Patty turn down  the radio please.  I just turned it  off.  Alright.  Let me come up.  I have been using  the internet to  fill out applications 
[00:45:30]  online which has  been a lot of fun  and I'm on about  five job hunting  sites too.  A member and  stuff with passwords.  Because you're  unemployed now, right?  Yeah, but I had an  interview with  Starbucks this week  and they're checking my  references and if all  goes well, I'll be  working again by April.  That's wonderful.  Yeah, and I wanted to  work with Starbucks.  What I did was I got up  and went to about  15, 20 Starbucks, 
[00:46:00]  left a resume,  a cover letter.  That's wonderful.  Fabulous stuff, Patty.  Hey, Patty, how much  was your PalTalk account?  Well, I had a little  help with that.  And what about the  camera?  The camera?  Well, Henoroso had  an extra one so he  just mailed it to me  because he didn't need  it.  Yeah, obviously this  camera is from like  1999.  It is an old one.  It looks like when you 
[00:46:30]  put a nickel in the  Nickelodeon and turn the  crank, Patty does a  little dance in black  and white.  I happen to love my  camera.  I think it's awesome.  Your camera stinks  compared to everyone  else's cameras.  Why don't you just  take Polaroids and  hold them up?  I love my camera.  Well, you're not even  in front of it.  I'm looking at an old  chair that looks like  it came from the  foundling center you  were at.  It's actually hotter  than her sitting there.  That chair is from  Little House on the  Prairie.  Did Paw Ingalls carve 
[00:47:00]  that fucking thing?  Look at it.  It probably did.  Look at that chair.  What year is that?  What year do you  live in?  She's got an old  tilted wooden  bookcase.  She has a wooden  bookcase that's  slanting and tilting  over to one side.  Yeah.  And she has to have  a pillow on her  wood chair.  All right, get the  hemorrhoids.  And that stupid cat  in that little room  there's probably hair  all over the place  and animal dander.  Oh, Patty, does that  pillow on your chair  just smell like ass? 
[00:47:30]  No, I have to be  comfortable because  the chair is wooden.  Hey, Patty, Anthony  did want to ask you  what rooms are you  hanging in?  What room?  Yeah, where do you  go aside from the  Opie and Anthony  room, Opie and  Anthony Live?  Oh, I go to the  virus room a lot  because it's smaller.  Yeah, but have you  gone to the adult,  some of the sex?  No, no, I haven't  explored those sites yet.  Patty, you can go  there now and in  the comfort of your  own home, see male 
[00:48:00]  junk without having  to worry about it  attacking you.  Why don't you go  look at a penis?  I guess I'll try  that tonight.  No, no, we want  you to try it right  now.  Try it right now,  okay?  I'm going to log on.  All right?  Log on.  All right, I'll try  it right now, but  that means I've got  to close out of the  room and stuff.  We understand.  And Patty, turn your  goddamn volume on  your computer down. 
[00:48:30]  I just about figured  out how to turn it  up.  I don't really know  much about computers.  You could have  stopped at I don't  really know much.  That's right.  I do know one thing.  I am interested in a  computer program up  in 125th Street where  they give computer  courses for free.  Yeah, they certainly  do.  Because they want  you to bring your  own computer up there  and then they  hit you over the  head with it and  take it.  Yo, man.  Yeah, I teach a  computer course. 
[00:49:00]  They have classes with  computers.  Yeah, I wonder where  they came from.  The last person that  brought their computer  to the lesson.  This cranberry sauce  on my keyboard.  It's so sticky.  It looks like ketchup.  Yeah, Patty, we're  going to teach you  cobalt.  Yeah.  Is that a 1980s  concept?  Actually, it is, Patty.  Very good.  Now, Patty.  Patty.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Are you logged on? 
[00:49:30]  Right now I am, yeah.  By the way, Patty, as  Anthony gets you in one  of these rooms, seriously,  do not take a computer  course.  No one takes computer  courses anymore.  No.  They have made it very  easy for you to just  figure it out on your  own.  Yeah, but I want to  know how to do quark and  Photoshop and how to do  all the little tricks with  the computer and how to  fix problems and stuff  like that that you might  have.  All right.  Then go up to 125th Street  and risk your life to be 
[00:50:00]  able to freaking...  I've been up there before  for different reasons and  stuff, you know.  Patty.  You're logged on?  Yes, I am.  Do you know how to get to  the list of rooms?  Get Patty's camera back on.  Sure I do, yeah.  All right, get the big  list of rooms.  Okay, let me just close  that on everything.  All right, Jesus Christ.  And then...  She's an old 486.  All right, now...  Monochrome monitor.  All right, now you got the  rooms?  Let's do browse video 
[00:50:30]  chat rooms.  What do you...  Adult contact on.  Patty.  Adult contact on.  Okay, browse video chat  rooms.  Adult.  Adult, right.  Okay.  Now, you see playground?  Playground.  Let me see.  Flirts or us, lustful  ladies.  Are you in...  Are you in adult?  Oh, yes, I do.  I see playground.  All right, click on  playground.  Okay, I just did.  All right.  All right.  Now...  Now...  Now...  Okay, Patty.  You gotta listen to me. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, preview some of the  cameras so...  Do you see...  Do you see porn, perverts,  pervets, flicks, and cams?  Yes, I do.  All right, get into that  room.  All right.  All right.  Doing it.  All right, you're in  there.  Now...  Now, click on  Allen  99969.  I missed it.  Okay.  View video.  Oh, my God.  They're doing something. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  That is a Negro  having ass sex  with a woman  by a pool.  Oh, I get it.  No, no.  Don't get out.  Look...  Look at the size  of that cock.  That's right.  Oh, you're...  Oh, my God.  What's he doing?  See, Patty,  this is the fun  of Pal...  Oh, look.  See?  Look, and that's  something a black man  doesn't normally do.  Those are fake.  What?  Do you see what he's 
[00:52:00]  doing there, Patty?  Yes, I do.  Now, wouldn't you like  a guy to be doing  that to you?  I don't know.  I have no idea  what it's like.  You're a virgin.  You're a 50-year-old  virgin.  Oh, my God.  Somebody said,  Hi, Patty.  Don't tell me  they know I'm here.  Yes, they do.  Why don't you  rip your clothes off  and cam up?  Cam up.  Cam up, Patty.  Cam up.  I'm just dealing  with seeing it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[00:52:30]  And somebody else  said,  Hi, Ann.  The same person.  There they are.  All right, Patty.  Patty, go to  Herbie Smoke-A-Lot.  Yeah, I'm okay.  All right, punch him up  and look at what  he's doing.  All righty.  I bet you see  your cat doing this  to himself all the time.  Okay, let me just...  Oh, wait.  What the heck?  See, look what  he's doing now.  He's going to dig  right in.  Oh, my God. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, Patty,  you have no idea  how wonderful that is.  It's weird.  It really is.  Look, look.  There he goes.  Oh, my God.  It's got to hurt.  No, it doesn't hurt.  He's giving her  a rim job.  Patty.  Oh.  Yeah, explain to  the rest of the country  what you're watching  right now.  Yeah, give us  a blow-by-blow.  Somebody's butt  and a guy taking  his middle finger,  which is the F finger,  and going in and out  of her butt.  Now what's he doing? 
[00:53:30]  He's just still doing it.  Yeah, but what's he  doing with his face?  What is he fisting?  Is that what fisting is?  No, that's not fisting.  Shoot.  He's going to hurt her.  Oh, my God.  That's not the part  of baby comes out,  you know?  Oh, Jesus.  I hate her.  Isn't she awful?  Oh, my God.  I hate her, too, Jimmy.  There's just something  about her I hate.  Oh, my God. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  You get a good view.  You know, some other  people followed me  into this room.  Of course they did.  Because they're going  back.  Oh, Patty, go back  to Alan's camera now.  Yeah.  And look at what  the black guy's doing.  Wow.  He is wrecking.  Alan, okay.  Let me just...  Oh, Alan, here he is.  Right here.  Yeah.  Let me just close  out of this month's  frosty.  Here you go.  They're having...  It looks like a little 
[00:54:30]  conventional sex going on.  Yeah, but then he...  In the normal sense  of the word.  You know, wait a minute.  They're posed a weird way.  It looks like just a butt  and nothing else.  No, her legs are  completely up in the air, Patty.  Yeah, they're up.  And her legs are together  to make it feel like  the cock is even bigger.  Is this...  That's not missionary.  No.  Patty, is this getting  you hot at all?  Like, are you getting  a feeling down there  like when you see  stuff like this? 
[00:55:00]  Well, I don't know.  If I was alone  and on my own  by myself, maybe.  But now I'm in the center  of everything.  I'm not right  under these circumstances.  No.  Well, now you know  the rooms are there.  So when you're alone,  you could log in  and look at some sex  and maybe play with yourself.  Really?  Because I only go on  in the morning  for the show  like a couple mornings  a weekend  just at night  in the middle of the day.  I'm up and out.  We got the bob cam 
[00:55:30]  on that black guy.  He's giving her  the jackhammer, though.  It's like all I see  is a bouncing butt  and nothing else.  No, you don't see  the ball bag?  Well, I see that too.  But wait,  there's two girls.  Yeah, it's called  fucking Patty.  You see it?  Yeah, except  as if what he's doing  is not enough.  You need them two  to get in there, too.  Well, yeah.  I thought it only  took two to tango.  Tango.  And Joey's back  is writing Patty, 
[00:56:00]  Patty, Patty.  I thought it took  two to tango.  Jesus Christ.  It takes two to tango,  but it takes three  to lay down  with a colored patty.  He's got a lollipop there.  All right.  Well, have fun  in those rooms, too, Patty.  Don't just hang out  in the O&A rooms.  It's about diversity  and variety.  And go to the lesbo rooms.  Just go to all  of the porno rooms  and enjoy.  And wait till the black guy  pulls his mule out.  There's going to be  a good dive of chocolate  on the helmet. 
[00:56:30]  All right, Patty.  Okay.  Have fun.  There you go,  stalker Patty, everyone.  Hey, now, this is D.L. Huger,  and you listen to  the worst of Opie and Ethnic.  It can't get no worse than this.  It ain't.  You want to play  a little more  Dateline Internet Predators  episode three?  Episode three?  Stop.  Was that three?  Yeah, we never got  to the end of it.  We got a few more guys.  Yeah.  Because we got another  perv in the news today.  Predators.  We might as well  play a little more  of this audio. 
[00:57:00]  Love it.  This is some of  the greatest audio ever.  It's the best reality show  on TV.  It beats American Idol  hands down.  Hands down.  They set up that old house  somewhere in California.  And now you got  the copycats.  They're doing the same  thing on Long Island.  They're doing it.  Frightening for the perverts  out there.  They're doing it all over  America now because of  Dateline.  They're just renting a  house for a day and  getting the pervs to show  up hoping they're going to  meet something young and  fresh.  Do they ever,  do the perverts ever  offer to send a car, 
[00:57:30]  pick up the 14-year-old,  and bring them to your  place?  Is that illegal?  Wow.  Good idea.  Because the cop can't  really hop in a car and  drive to your house.  Then they're kind of  coming to meet you.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't?  I'm sure there's some  excuse like, I can't do  that, you're going to  have to come here, and  then the pervs are all.  Hold on.  I got to get my phone.  Yeah, cancel the limo  today that I had going to  the middle school.  Thank you. 
[00:58:00]  Chicken's always funny.  Trying to recover.  It's always, it's  actually not a bad, it's  more of an interesting  suggestion, like, could  you do that?  Could you?  Then again, if they're  saying, the cop would  actually just get in the  car and show up and  fuck you.  But then they couldn't  because then it's just  like, you know, what are  they going to do, get out  of the limo, you go,  that's the 14-year-old  boy I want to fuck?  Oops.  Maybe you shouldn't say  that.  You're 45 wearing a Boy  Scout outfit, sir. 
[00:58:30]  So this really old dude is  going to the house that  they set up with the cops  to meet something young.  I don't know if it's a  girl or a guy, probably a  guy, probably a boy, and  here's some of the fine  audio.  What you up to today?  Nothing.  Yeah, just to set up.  So the old dude is in the  house and all of a sudden  now Dateline, you know,  jumps into the room.  It's great.  They have a girl in there  that could sound like a  young boy or a young girl.  Right.  Yeah, and she gets them to  come through the back door  of the house, of course. 
[00:59:00]  And there's the Dateline  guy waiting for them.  Hold on a second.  Can we go to Jay,  Chocolate City?  Jay, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to let  all the new listeners know  what a lucky fella,  little Jimmy, is.  He has now escaped  Perlin City Park,  Central Park, two times.  He had that wall almost  fall on him, fella.  You had a wall almost  fall on you?  Yeah, when he was getting  that knob job by that  hooker, that retaining wall, 
[00:59:30]  about a year ago.  What?  All right, car crash,  punch it out.  He can't crash and then  punch out.  I have no idea what that  story is about.  Hold on, Nathaniel,  did Danny just send you in?  Oh, thank you.  All right, here we go.  So the old dude is in the  house and now Dateline  pops into the room to  to give him the bad news.  What you up to today?  Nothing.  Call.  Talk with the gentleman.  I have a place that I  have for sales. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, you're selling a house.  I see.  And he was interested.  Well, here's what doesn't  make sense about that.  How is a 13-year-old going  to afford to buy your home?  Well, I didn't know how  old he was.  I didn't ask.  Stop to ask his age.  Well, Chuck, the only  problem with that story is  is that I have the  transcripts of your  conversation with Luke.  Jarrett.  What are you looking for?  I could be your grandpa.  Into young boys your age.  Love to cuddle with them.  Caress their body.  Work my... 
[01:00:30]  And it goes on from there.  Work my...  I'm disgusted.  Let's play Matt's game.  Work my...  Hairless cock.  Can I say how much I hate  this reporter's voice?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, is he a funny...  Work my...  Blank.  He has too much joy in his  soul that he's doing this  job.  A 13-year-old boy. 
[01:01:00]  Charles Nelson Reilly,  work my butthole.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I don't know.  Ow!  All right.  We have more...  Work my prostate like a  speed bag.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Could you choke me with  my ascot till I almost  pass out?  Give me some poppers.  Ow!  Ow!  I like a guy that looks  like Brett Summers.  Ow! 
[01:01:30]  Ah, too good.  All right.  We got more audio of the  really old dude.  Finally, he decides to  tell the truth.  And he actually admits  that he might have had  sex with the boy.  But if he would have  consented to having sex,  what would have happened?  I'd be very hesitant at first.  If he continued, then  possibly we would have had it.  Possibly you would have had  sex with a 13-year-old boy.  If, you know, I felt  uncomfortable and I felt  that he was, you know,  not fit or anything, 
[01:02:00]  I would have walked away.  Not fit?  How can a 13-year-old boy  be fit to have sex  with a 65-year-old man?  I mean, fat.  Don't you see  a tissue there?  Well, I see nothing wrong  with cuddling and caressing.  Then he talks about  a book he reads  that fills him with fantasies.  It deals with younger,  older, you know,  father, son.  Father, son?  Oh!  You're talking about  fathers having sex  with their sons,  grandfathers having sex  with their grandkids.  Yeah, and doctors  with their patients, 
[01:02:30]  employees with their young patients.  You talk about this  like it's some sort of hobby  building train sets.  That's not what  we're talking about here.  It's a book that I read  and I fantasize.  Wow.  Way to not give out the title.  Is that on Oprah's list?  Oprah's book?  I don't think so.  I think that guy  probably,  I think his lawyer  probably would have told him  to shut up. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  I think that was a bad thing  he did there legally.  Yes.  For his case.  That kid caused a problem.  I fantasize about  hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina,  hummina, hummina,  young boy, hummina,  a young man,  a cardi boy came up  with a baseball bat.  Hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina.  He's on Ed Norton's  baseball team.  Hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina.  The book's called  The Million.  Big ball, Norton.  Pull the diaper off,  grandpa will get it.  The book is called  The Million Little Asses.  All right, here we go.  Some more audio 
[01:03:30]  from the old dude.  Are you ready to go?  Yeah, everyone in.  Here's a man  with the screen name  Guy from Mars 83  who seems to think  it's perfectly legal  for an adult to talk online  to a 13-year-old  about leading for sex.  Guy from Mars.  It's my favorite book.  Men are from Mars.  Kids are from Sesame Street.  I think this is a new dude, huh?  Yeah.  This is a new guy.  I love him.  Anybody want him?  Yeah, come on in.  Here's a man  with the screen name 
[01:04:00]  Guy from Mars 83  who seems to think  it's perfectly legal  for an adult  to talk online  to a 13-year-old  about meeting for sex.  How are you?  Imagine the poor guy  with the screen name  Guy from Mars 82.  Like,  I've got to change  my whole fucking screen name now.  He's just a fan.  This asshole.  He's a fan of astronomy.  That's all, you know.  Guy from Mars, you know.  Gets on with other geeks  and talks about stars.  Hey, did you hear  about the face on Mars  isn't really a face?  Looking from another...  What?  I'm not a pervert. 
[01:04:30]  What the fuck?  No, that's the other.  One more up.  They're trying to rock  with oxygen in it.  Yeah, a bunch of guys.  Guy from Mars 80  chat with him.  Yeah.  Guy from Venus.  They're having another  problem with him  because he wants  to talk about Venus  and they're like,  it's too close to the sun  to have life, you dope.  That's a very good point.  ...to a 13-year-old  about meeting for sex.  Hey, how are you?  Pretty good, sir.  And then show up  at her house.  He's 23-year-old 
[01:05:00]  Inderjeet Singh.  Oh, boy.  Well, you can talk.  You can converse.  But it doesn't mean  I'm going to do it, right?  Unless I do it.  Unless you catch me  on point doing it.  Oh, well.  So you say I would have  to catch you having sex  with a 13-year-old girl  before you could get in trouble.  Maybe in India.  Before you can put me  against the law.  It is against the law.  So you're a lawyer?  I'm not a lawyer.  Oh.  Well, you sound pretty familiar  with the law.  Well, I'm pretty much 
[01:05:30]  into academics, so...  You're into academics.  Well, let me correct you  a little bit  that's how the law works.  Okay.  Go ahead and turn around for me.  Please let me go  because...  Let you go.  Let you go why?  Right here.  I haven't done any  other crime in the past.  I'm very clean.  This is the first time?  Yes.  Okay.  Please believe me.  Well, I love the  please let me go.  Like, what makes a person  say that?  Is it that last-ditch effort?  Is it just the nothing?  Because...  Can you possibly think 
[01:06:00]  they're going to go,  he said it?  All right.  I guess we gotta.  They're not letting you go.  We should talk to the cops today  because no matter  what kind of crime you commit,  everyone does that.  Please, please, come on, man.  Just let me go and I'll...  First time, I'll never do it again.  All right.  All right, you wacky bastard.  You can go.  Let's talk to the cops.  I don't think it's ever happened.  And it's...  The cops always ask.  You make a good point.  Just put your hands behind your... 
[01:06:30]  You gotta look.  You gotta step out of the moment.  You're not there anymore.  Look ahead and see what you're gonna do  once you get to lock up  to get out of that situation.  Because once they're doing it,  just put your hands behind your back  and cooperate.  Don't talk to them.  Don't do anything.  Just go to jail.  And then decide  how you're gonna get out of it.  Because asking, begging,  talking, saying stuff,  it will all just work against you.  See, it's like the weird...  You're like an animal.  Like, one minute you're relaxed 
[01:07:00]  and, like, you're ready to have sex.  The next minute you're a moose  sitting in a lady's car.  You're sticking out the windshield.  You just can't believe it's happening.  So you're like, I panic.  That's like almost like...  That's stripped of all societal dignity,  stripped of all messages.  That's just basic.  That's the core of what you want to say.  Emotionally, it's one extreme to the other, too.  I mean, solid.  One extreme to the other.  You're whipped up into this frenzy of sex  that, you know,  you think you're gonna have this  best fetish perverted sex 
[01:07:30]  you're ever gonna have.  And then,  a couple of seconds later,  you're being arrested.  Yeah.  Yikes.  Can you please just let me go?  No.  Let me talk about it with the guys over here.  That would be really funny.  Look, dude.  It's your first time?  Really?  Because then they'd be begging.  Yeah, yeah.  It's my fault.  Okay, shh, shh.  You know cops do that  just to make their day a little more fun.  I'm gonna talk with my sergeant over here  because since it is your first time...  I'll be right back.  I'll be right back.  And then talk and go,  dude, I'm pulling the old... 
[01:08:00]  This guy thinks he's getting old.  Look at it.  Now, let's look over at him.  Look at his face.  How sorry he looks.  And then they all nod yes  and you take the handcuff keys out.  Take the cuff keys out,  start walking over to him  and then just lock the cuffs  so they don't move.  No, sorry.  I gotta take you in, asshole.  Yeah.  All right.  We got more audio  from the Dateline Internet Predators  episode three.  This guy is trying to be normal.  That's his screen name.  Would you come on over here  and have a seat, please?  How you doing?  Good.  How are you?  All right.  Don't be fooled. 
[01:08:30]  And until you hear more about him,  he's a convicted felon.  What's going on?  I'm just meeting a friend  that I met on the Internet.  Really?  He's 48-year-old Daniel Allen,  screen name trying to be normal.  Online, he promised to teach a girl  who said she was 13  different sexual positions  and show her what a man really likes,  not sex.  I don't know how old.  That's why I'm here.  I'm just curious.  You're just curious?  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't bring any booze with me.  I didn't absolutely curiosity. 
[01:09:00]  Leave your dick at home?  Because I think that's the important part  of this whole thing.  Not the booze or the presents.  It's your dick.  Unless you left that at home,  please see the man in blue.  His chat log suggests something else.  I will come to you  and we will get a place  for passionate love.  Yeah, well,  what does that sound like to you?  Good point.  It's old.  He says, oh my God, how cool.  And then you say,  wow, 13, am I too old? 
[01:09:30]  Nah, am I too young?  I hate to say this,  but you're not.  Why do you hate to say that?  Because it's like I'm some old pervert,  but girls your age are so much more fun.  Let me say this.  Go ahead.  Okay.  I'd have conversations like this  with people that turn out to be guys  more than half the time.  Lucky fella.  But half the time they're not.  Half the time, yeah.  Good point.  Tell that to the judge. 
[01:10:00]  He'll be very understanding.  Dope.  You know, a lot of times I fuck kids.  It turns out they're older men, Your Honor.  Bye.  I can empathize.  Get out of here.  Half the time.  They're not even kids.  And the other half the time,  they're infants.  You can't win.  Don't you see something inappropriate about that?  Well, I mean, maybe so,  but I had my big doubts that she was 13, you know.  Then he admits this isn't his first time.  You've visited people who you met online 
[01:10:30]  who said they were 13 before?  Well, yeah, 13 or 15.  So it's not the first time you've done this?  Well, no.  Wait a minute.  I've never met a 13-year-old girl from offline.  Well, what I'm saying is,  did you ever go meet somebody  who said they were 13 online?  Um, no, not 13.  16 in my area, and it was a guy  How about, say, 21?  A guy who had a big laugh on me. 
[01:11:00]  He's raising the age 45.  It's grandfatherly.  And then it gets ugly.  You see how it looks.  I see how it looks.  You're absolutely right.  You know, I mean, you're right.  Now it was time to tell him who I am.  I am Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC,  and we're doing a story on Computer Predators.  Ah, well, you better...  I'll shove that camera down his throat.  I don't think you're going to want to do that.  Why is that?  I don't think you'll want to do it.  Now, we can't keep you here. 
[01:11:30]  If you want to say anything else to us,  we'd love to hear it.  You're free to leave, obviously,  if you want to go.  Okay, but can I talk to you outside?  No, I can't have the cameras turned off at this point.  I can't there.  Well, then I'd like to say that  pretty much I think you have it all wrong.  Pretty much.  But your point's well taken.  Hi, guys.  Pretty weird.  Cut.  I love the you're free to go part.  You're free to go for 10 feet. 
[01:12:00]  And then you will be arrested.  That's him just being a pussy.  Yeah, I can't turn the cameras off at this point.  You're free to go, because if he says  there's, you know, cops in the area,  then all hell's going to break loose  and he doesn't want to deal with that.  I then read the transcript  of the conversation that was about Graphic Slough.  God, his voice.  It's mind-boggling what a parody of a reporter he is.  Just smarmy.  Shucks.  Shucks.  Who talks like that?  I would like to meet you with you  and cuddle and touch each other. 
[01:12:30]  Each other.  Really?  What is going through your mind  when you're writing most kind of...  Why is it going to hurt the story  if he goes,  are you here to meet a minor for sex?  Are people going to go,  I don't know, that's not official.  Yeah.  Who is this guy?  Hello, please take a seat.  Why are you talking like that?  Right.  That's what I'd say.  Forget about me fucking children.  Do a story on why you talk like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hairless asses get me high. 
[01:13:00]  But your voice, sir, it has to be fixed.  What is that?  Kevin the cop, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Long time, long time.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Kev.  Anthony, are you sure you weren't on the job?  Why?  What's that, fella?  Because that whole thing with the handcuff keys  is so fucking accurate.  You do that?  Oh, my God.  I just thought it would be a hysterical joke.  That is so fucking accurate.  I swear to God.  I'm a highway cop out on the island. 
[01:13:30]  I got a civilian complaint one time  for laughing so hard at you motherfuckers  that the person thought I was laughing at them  in the rearview mirror and wrote a letter.  Oh, no kidding.  So what do you do?  We know the cops very well.  You go to arrest them and they beg?  Oh, all the time.  Yeah.  Everybody thinks it's just like,  okay, please, please.  Come on, God.  Give me a break, will you?  Have you ever let anybody go?  When you got to lock somebody up,  you got to lock them up.  I mean, there's so much liability involved. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  But I let people go on the speeders all the time.  Right.  Speed, really?  I'm mostly just a speed guy.  Are you Suffolk or Nassau?  I'm in Nassau.  That's all I can say.  All right.  Watch out for anything.  Nassau, guys.  I'll tell you, though,  Nassau Highway Patrol are some tough guys, man.  They are really tough to get out of a ticket with.  Well, you got to understand something.  The precinct cops,  it's a summons.  You know, you got to make some numbers and stuff like that. 
[01:14:30]  They got to be decent summonses.  But most of the time,  you got some leeway back and forth.  The reason why there are highway cops in the first place  is because someone has to give the ticket and not give a break.  That's why they're there.  Yeah, you get pulled over by highway,  you're getting a ticket.  No matter what.  That's their job.  Yeah.  If they start not giving out tickets,  then what are they doing?  Sit around.  It's like Anthony said that Long Island cops  don't have the balls to give him a ticket.  Hey, I didn't say that.  I love the Long Island cops. 
[01:15:00]  No, you were just saying yesterday on the show, Anthony.  That's an escalate and a CRX ride.  Those brilliant cops on Long Island  have to shovel up more drunken teens every weekend  than anywhere else in the country.  No, but it was like you say.  Anthony says he doesn't even really like to slow down.  He'll just poke his lips by the window and go,  I'm Anthony from the radio.  And they scatle back to the car like girls.  That's what Ed says.  At this point,  I don't even have time to meet you and give you autographs.  You know, I can laugh along.  I got somewhere to go.  I can laugh along with what Jimmy and Opie are saying  because I am such a strong supporter of the police department 
[01:15:30]  that it comes off as a joke  because everyone knows that.  We know that.  I hear you talking guns and stuff like that.  What do you got?  What do you think?  Get you down here to our range to shoot a little bit.  What do you guys think of Swazi?  Well, I don't work for Swazi, thank God.  No, but he's running  and he wants to cut funding to the Nassau cops.  Well, he's been cutting the Nassau cops.  I say, fuck Swazi.  Well, I agree. 
[01:16:00]  Pay the cops what they deserve.  You see what this guy found out.  One million dollars apiece.  I'll bet you'd like him if his last name was Swastika.  Swazi.  All right, thanks, Jerry.  So glad to be finally on satellite with you guys.  Love every minute of it.  Laugh too hard during the day and get in trouble.  All right, thanks, buddy.  Bye, mister.  All right, all the best.  Stay.  Cool.  Yeah, we love the cops.  Absolutely.  John in Texas, what's going on?  Tankless job.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  That's part of this job is when we go in the middle of the night. 
[01:16:30]  I'm a federal marshal and we wake these guys up to pick them up  and they look at you and they say, hey, how you doing?  And they don't know we're coming from.  Especially after we've just kicked in their door.  Hey, what's up, man?  What are you here for?  I didn't do anything.  We have a breaker bar that we go in the door and on the side of it says,  may I come in, please?  That's funny. 
[01:17:00]  Very good.  Texas federal marshal.  Thank you, John.  Tough guy, man.  That is really funny.  Hey, folks, this is Adam West from Family Guy and other things that you know about.  You're listening to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, we were going to try to get to this earlier.  Fox 5 story on negative political ads.  This will lead into the political ads about The Opie and Anthony Show  and then we're going to get out of here so you guys can catch a flight. 
[01:17:30]  How's that sound?  Sounds good.  I like it.  They say politics is a dirty business and judging by some recent campaign ads,  it's never been dirtier.  Bada bing, we're in it.  But deep.  And worse, this guy Tom Kane,  he wants to clean things up, even cut taxes.  Hey, where's our take in that?  They've reached a new low in smear campaigning.  It's just, you know, and I disagree with totally.  I think they should do something.  I think it shouldn't be allowed.  The minute you see them,  you almost feel like one's just trying to downplay the other person 
[01:18:00]  so you're not really focusing on what they're saying.  It's just terrible campaign tactics these days just to get votes.  Often, political action committees, independent of any candidate, run the nastiest ads,  like the anti-Bob Menendez Sopranos spoof.  But listen to this Senate campaign ad in Tennessee, where Democrat Harold Ford is mocked.  I met Harold at the Playboy party.  We took money from porn movie producers.  I mean, who hasn't?  Harold, call me. 
[01:18:30]  Pretty lowbrow stuff, and the ad directly from the Republican National Committee,  one the GOP's own candidate thinks is over the top.  We think the ad is tacky.  We think it's not senatorial.  We think it has no place in this race.  See, here's what the politicians do, which is, it amazes me.  They put out these ads that are so despicable and so negative,  and just mudslinging.  Then they get on and say how horrible it is that that ad is running,  and it shouldn't be running. 
[01:19:00]  Well, then have it taken off.  Should it be called mudslinging at this point?  It's more than that.  It's cum-slinging.  This is cum-slinging.  They're cum-slinging and shit-slinging.  The way Migs throw it, right at your mouth.  We can't get enough of it this year, though.  Bob Menendez said, I can smell your cunt.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:19:30]  Who's his opponent, the guy we love?  Ron Conner.  Ron Conner.  Ron Conner.  It makes you remember his name.  That ad does nothing but make you remember the candidate's name.  Ron Kine voted to tuck your dick between your legs  and kill a senator's daughter in a well.  I love those ads.  So the listeners threw together some ads.  We're actually, the call is out to the listeners. 
[01:20:00]  Put together negative campaign ads for people on the show.  And we got three that are worth playing today.  Make sure you send them in to Steve or Danny.  Danny at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  We got a couple examples that are working pretty good.  Also, I think the info is up on opianthony.com.  Here's the first Opian Anthony political ad.  Anthony Cumia has a very big secret. 
[01:20:30]  Do you really want your favorite radio host  to be someone who aligns themselves with Nazi Germany?  Anthony Cumia admitted this himself.  I'm into Nazis.  Let's hear that again.  I'm into Nazis.  And one more damning time.  I'm into Nazis.  Paid for by the friends of Billy Burr. 
[01:21:00]  When did I yell I'm into Nazis?  When haven't you?  During Schindler's List?  Now they can just clip, when did I yell?  And you'll have another, I'm into Nazis.  There you go.  Oh, there it is again.  Oh, Jimmy.  So there's the first one.  Very good.  I don't say things that are going to damage my political career.  No.  Like you'd never hear me saying, yeah, my name's Jim and I suck cum.  You know, a listener, a listener, Jim, might take that clip now and twist it around and use it against you. 
[01:21:30]  You gotta be careful because there are guys who will go, yeah, give me ten bucks.  I'll let you fuck my mother's mouth while she sleeps.  You might use that in an ad that you're trying to take money.  With what you're saying on the show.  And sell off your mom like that.  Oh, I don't know.  You gotta watch.  You can't say things like that.  Like, use me as a cum dumpster.  You know?  Because people will use it.  See, if you disguise your voice like that. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, through the almond filter.  Nobody knows who you are anymore.  Now I can be whoever I want.  Go ahead.  I dare you to isolate this.  Give me a load, I'll swallow.  Here's the next Opie and Anthony.  I did a lot of gay references today, by the way.  I apologize.  Go ahead.  Opie and Anthony show political ad.  Martini Steve is incapable of expressing emotion.  Why not?  Martini Steve has no feelings. 
[01:22:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Time and again, Martini Steve has proven that he doesn't have what it takes to be an actor.  James Norton has a track record of successful, long-running television series like Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn and HBO's Lucky Moon.  James Norton has what it takes.  Please hire him.  Best paid for by MBSD Entertainment and David Steinberg.  That's not bad.  That's Tom S. in Boston, the first one, by the way. 
[01:23:00]  About Anthony was Jared in Boston.  Could have used some of the clips, though, that you had there.  I wouldn't come on these airwaves and say things like, the Amber Alert System should be called the Tattletail Alert System.  Yeah, I agree.  You got to be careful what you say.  Because a friend of mine once said, I dominate blacks because that's what I do. 
[01:23:30]  And that could come back to haunt him.  You know?  You got to be careful.  Oh, but you're not kidding from your lips to God's ears.  You got to be careful.  You got to be careful and say things like, why can't we bring back whites and colored water fountains?  Or things that you don't mean.  Oh, my God.  Well, see, I would never say something like that because it could be taken out of context and used against you.  How about take two on that, though, is what I'm getting at you.  No, I like how nervous I sounded saying it. 
[01:24:00]  You were clipped.  You put the wrong tense in.  White and black.  And colored.  Black only.  I'm very sleepy.  And I have a flight into goddamn Denver.  But you're as sweet as the day is long.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  By the way, David Steinberg is my manager.  I was watching Seinfeld the other night.  Yeah.  Fucking Jerry and Jace Alexander were peeking around at the Friars Club.  They go, oh, there's David Steinberg.  And he goes, the comedian?  No, the manager.  Yeah.  And then they go, like, they're all disappointed.  Yeah.  I wouldn't be.  Finally, the last political ad for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:24:30]  This is the last one for today.  We hope to get a lot more by Monday.  Before you head to the polls this November, Steve C. would like you to know a few things about his opponent, Anthony Cumia.  Did you know that Anthony Cumia doesn't like black people?  In fact, he lives in one of the whitest neighborhoods in greater New York City.  And though he may be surrounded by Jews, it's a known fact that Anthony Cumia is a Nazi. 
[01:25:00]  And during a recent skit on the Opie and Anthony program, Anthony played the part of Senator Mark Foley.  Kid Toucher, you decide.  Steve C. speaks with perfect enunciation and inflection.  Steve C. has never had a girlfriend placed in a loony bin.  Steve C. cares about the environment.  He drives a hybrid, not some flashy Mustang. 
[01:25:30]  Steve C. cares about the environment because he lives in the environment.  Brr.  Played for by the World Wildlife Fund.  Steve Irwin, treasurer.  That's the one to beat right there.  That's a good one, man.  That's the best one so far.  We just want some clips.  If they have clips, we would love to get clips in there of the show.  Yeah.  It's always so funny when they're out of context.  That guy had the music down, though.  That whole ominous music where you're talking about the opponent. 
[01:26:00]  And then the very patriotic Steve music.  Steve.  I live in the environment.  Grr.  Grr.  Very good, guys.  That was John in Hartford.  Very good, John.  I have a feeling he might be in radio.  Yeah, that was very funny.  His voice is a radio voice.  Yeah.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, story of the day.  Sorry for that interruption there.  This is great.  Listen in.  We're going to begin with an attack on Long Island.  And it is, frankly, beyond shocking. 
[01:26:30]  A developmentally disabled man, a bowling alley worker,  viciously attacked by two teenagers,  sexually abused with a plumber's snake.  The two teenagers are now charged.  Who would do this and why?  It happened at a bowling alley in Shirley.  Who wouldn't and why not?  Who I would assume supporter Jim Dillon is for us tonight.  Jim?  Bill, first, a bit of a warning.  There just is no way to tell this horrible thing.  Oh, that's great.  He's got to warn them.  These dopes.  Bit of a warning. 
[01:27:00]  By the way, I'm fucking, we're speechless here.  When he said a bit of a warning,  there's no way to tell this without laughter.  Make him believe they're getting something done.  You're kidding me.  There you go.  A bit of a warning.  Horrible, depraved story without being more graphic than any of us would like to be.  Keep in mind that the victim in this case is a 21-year-old developmentally disabled man  described here at the bowling alley by people as friendly and innocent.  He is a maintenance worker who people here say would never hurt anyone. 
[01:27:30]  But on Sunday night, according to police, he was followed into the men's room by two men,  one of whom held him down, and the other one sexually assaulted him with a plumber's tool.  I don't want any story about me, no part of any story about me to be described by people at the bowling alley as...  There is a great line here in the post where it says, 
[01:28:00]  they're talking about, they followed maintenance employee of AMF Shirley Lanes into the bathroom.  He was a Shirley Lanes employee.  Shirley Lanes.  Shirley, your asshole can't be sore.  And it says, as one teen held the victim down, the other forced the plumbing snake inside him and spun it several times.  Wow.  The man suffered severe pain, bleeding, and internal injuries.  Wow.  See those things?  And a little bit of...  He's a little ashamed, too, probably.  He's a little embarrassed.  He's a little embarrassed.  I don't care how developmentally challenged you are. 
[01:28:30]  That part of you is not...  I may be retarded, but this is kind of a drag.  I really don't think this is right.  You ever think what these guys do right after a crazy act like that before the cops discover what happened?  Like, ha ha, and then throw the snake down.  And then what?  What's the...  Ah!  Ah!  What do we...  Ah, shit.  Did we just do that?  Yeah, did we just do that?  Yeah.  Did I just hold him down while you shoved that plumber snake up his ass? 
[01:29:00]  Dude, why do we do this?  Dude, we...  Dude.  But how did they come to it?  Like, did one guy...  Well, that's what I wanted...  Because you look at the picture that, like, these kids...  I get that you're, you know, you're a teenager, you're bored.  Yeah.  But how did he, you know...  Hey, my dad's got a plumber snake.  You know that retarded guy at the pool?  Why don't we get him in the bathroom, you hold him, and I'll snake it up his ass, and then, you know...  Spin it.  We'll do ten frames.  Like, what the fuck?  Got any quarters?  I want to play Ms. Packard.  Hey, Jim in Jersey. 
[01:29:30]  Jim!  Yo, I got a pat for Munaki line.  Okay.  I guess they gave him the old 7-10 split.  Yeah, that is a pat for Munaki line.  Devoid of humor.  All right.  There you go.  There's more to the story here.  Of course there is.  Oh, the report goes to the address of one of the suspects.  That's good.  At the address police sources give for one of those charged, nobody seemed to know Steven Rodriguez.  You know Mr. Rodriguez?  No. 
[01:30:00]  No.  No.  No, not live here.  No.  No.  That takes balls.  Going to the house.  Yeah.  Or a fucking bad job.  The reporter might have a fetish.  That'd be great.  They'd grab the reporter, hold him down, and snake his ass.  I'll give you an exclusive.  My ass was snaked as I tried to find Mr. Rodriguez.  It seems it's more to meet the eye.  Yeah.  This story didn't end here.  No.  It ended in my anus.  And it goes on still. 
[01:30:30]  I'm Ernie and Ash just reporting from my bed at Columbia Presbyterian on my stomach.  At least I'm not a retard working at the bowling alley.  Otherwise, in every other way.  Chris from Oklahoma City, they pull out the snake and there's just pennies and gum stuck to it.  Pennies and gum?  Jesus.  Oh, we're supposed to be sad here, guys.  Oh, yes.  Come on.  Maybe that's it.  They were convinced there was something in his ass valuable or that they lost. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  And they're just trying to help a guy out.  I got to hear this guy again.  Nah.  At the address police sources give for one of those charged, nobody seemed to know Steven Rodriguez.  You know Mr. Rodriguez?  No.  Not at all?  No.  Police gave this address as where he lives.  Well, I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't live here.  I'm just sitting in my system.  What a shitty reporter.  What a great family. 
[01:31:30]  No one seemed to know.  I asked one man who had no reason to know.  Who are you?  I'm just a plumber.  I lost a tool here.  Yeah.  I'm looking for my snake.  Somebody stole my snake.  I left him here.  Jurassic is where he lives.  Well, I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't live here.  I'm just visiting my system.  Does your sister know Mr. Rodriguez?  I have no idea.  Does Mr. Rodriguez live here?  I just got here from Florida.  I couldn't help you, dude.  And it's little wonder nobody admits knowing him.  He is now charged in one of the most holistic. 
[01:32:00]  He's not admitting it.  He's from Florida, you fucking adult.  He's not admitting it.  The guy instantly just accused him of lying.  And this lying sack of shit.  Do you still have to use the news?  No wonder.  Do you still have to use the news voice in a story like this?  Yeah, I know.  No one seems to know.  It's no wonder no one's saying he lives here.  Listen to the reporter's voice.  Mr. Rodriguez live here?  I just got here from Florida.  I couldn't help you, dude.  And it's little wonder nobody admits knowing him. 
[01:32:30]  He is now charged in one of the most horrific, one of the most heartless crimes in memory.  I don't know about heartless.  Yeah, I think that took a lot of heartless.  One hold him down, one does it, then they switch off.  Team effort?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Then you switch off your turn.  Yeah, come on.  I'm sick of holding him.  How does that play out?  I thought retards were strong.  What a fucking docile nothing this guy was.  21.  21 years old, too.  Yeah.  He was of age.  At least.  Yeah, at least that it wasn't.  Yeah, at least it wasn't. 
[01:33:00]  Now they can claim it was consensual.  We didn't know.  He said, er.  Okay.  I love you.  Hey, Anthony.  Don't we have audio of the attack?  Oh, I think we might.  We have an exclusive on our show.  Actually, you know, it wasn't that bad for him.  Right.  It sounds like a horrific thing to happen to somebody, but he actually worked there.  He used to set the pins with his asshole.  So, it really didn't hurt him that much as I looked for the proper sound of never fucking 
[01:33:30]  I think there was some microphones in the bathroom.  With a lucky break.  With a lucky break.  With a lucky break.  Actually, actually, I was thinking of other audio.  No, I was thinking of audio before the act was committed. 
[01:34:00]  Oh.  I have no idea.  Let's see what's cooking in your room.  Let's see what's cooking in your room.  Oh, her.  Shit.  You mean it might have been that they wanted to check and see if he had some blockage of  some sort.  Actually, he just, it wasn't even the whole act.  It was just the day.  He didn't want to do it on that day.  It's out Friday wide.  Oh, Friday wide.  Announcing when he's going to shit. 
[01:34:30]  So, yeah.  All right.  What do you got cooking in your oven over here?  That's a fake laugh if I ever heard one.  All right.  Well, we got more details to the story.  Steve couldn't be happy about this.  And the most heinous act ever.  Heartless.  Heartless.  A mentally challenged man with a snake up his ass. 
[01:35:00]  All right.  More to the story here.  Of course.  A maintenance worker at the Shirley Lanes Bowling Alley, a 21-year-old developmentally  disabled man, was followed into the bathroom here and savagely sexually assaulted with a  mechanical plumbing device.  This guy's getting into it, man.  Anyone else hear that?  Savagely sexually assaulted with a mechanical plumbing device. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, fuck.  Lucky fella.  Plumbers have gone wild.  A plumbing device.  The assault caused severe internal injuries and the victim was found bleeding on the floor.  Charged in the attack were 19-year-old Steven Rodriguez and 17-year-old Michael Lunsford, both from Shirley and both men, now charged with aggravated sexual assault in the first degree.  No one with a bowling alley would talk with us on camera, but everyone here knows the victim, and everyone here now knows what happened to him. 
[01:36:00]  There are obvious and unpleasant echoes in this case in the Abner Louima case in which a police officer sexually assaulted a man with a stick, but this victim was developmentally disabled.  He was just 21 years old.  And also the plumbing, they don't even make the connection.  No.  It wasn't a stick, it was a plunger.  It wasn't a stick, it was a fucking snake. 
[01:36:30]  So it's like something about plumbing equipment makes people go, I gotta put something in, I gotta put this in somebody's ass.  Now.  The toilet's clogged.  Fuck.  I need to grab something and shove it up some guy's ass.  Tim from Connecticut, on the instant feedback, there's snakes in his motherfucking ass.  Snakes.  The fucking, oh yeah.  I don't know how filthy those things are.  He had the mind of a three-year-old and the asshole of a 38-year-old porn star.  Those things are filthy, too.  You ever seen a plumber's, uh, plumber's snake thing? 
[01:37:00]  They don't sit there and clean them off.  No, they wipe them down with a rag for a minute.  It's not like they boil them afterwards.  Disgusting.  It's not meant for the anus.  And then to spin it a few times, those things have, like, blades on them.  Yeah.  They have blades that...  Well, if you're gonna stick it in, you gotta spin it.  You gotta spin it.  What's the whole point?  You gotta go to the distance.  You gotta go to the distance.  You gotta go to the distance.  You gotta go to the distance.  No.  It's just stupid.  Yeah, it's a waste of time.  What's it look like?  Dude, we're here, let's spin the fucking thing.  Yeah.  It's almost like metal conduit, like a coil, and then inside that coil is a cable, and 
[01:37:30]  on the end of it is some kind of a blade that spins, so you could crank away on this  thing.  Yeah, it's meant to cut through, you know, century-old shit that's built up in pipes.  Yeah, waste.  In your pipe, and what you do is feed it down.  Or a retarded man's asshole.  You feed it down the toilet as you crank the handle.  Or the retarded guy's asshole.  Or the retarded guy's asshole.  And it cleans it out.  Dual purpose. 
[01:38:00]  There you go, Jimmy.  There it is, Jimmy.  Look at this thing.  I'm thinking these guys, by the way, didn't do well on their SATs.  Nah, I like to.  Oh, my God.  Now, why was the snake in the bathroom?  Well, maybe he had to go.  It's one of those things, like, they don't usually just have him laying around.  Well, he was probably going in there to fix a toilet.  There was a toilet full of diarrhea and shit and tampons that he was fixing.  Oh, so you think he.  So they went in there and they improvised.  They improvised.  They found, yeah, they said, hey, let's use what he's using. 
[01:38:30]  Well, they just saw the retarded man walking to the bathroom with the snake.  And the one guy went, are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Oh, my God.  And the one guy said, yeah.  And then he goes, as he's holding the guy down, putting it in his ass, the other guy's like,  I just thought he wanted to turn the lights off and run.  And I didn't know we were going to rape another man who was developmentally disabled.  Johnny and Spionk.  Johnny.  Hey, how you doing? 
[01:39:00]  Hey.  Hey, Johnny.  You ever been to this bowling alley?  It's Shirley.  I mean, you talk about animals.  And I'm not just the Spanish guys either.  Just the white trash that's out there is terrible.  Yeah, Shirley is not really a nice place out of Long Island.  Oh, my God.  It's like Brentwood.  It's out of exit 64.  Exit 64 of the expressway.  Around Waiting River, right?  Yeah.  It's somewhere in there.  It's like the last bastion of, like, condos and things.  And then you pass that and you're out, you know. 
[01:39:30]  You're out on the island.  Wine country.  Right.  It's wine country.  Well, Shirley.  The retarded guy whining in the bathroom.  About this.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Johnny.  You got it.  Just a horrific story today.  All right.  And I think his life was going so great, too.  Yeah.  Retarded guy working in a bowling alley.  And Shirley.  And Shirley.  God, what a far tumble that was for him.  He's the only guy who ever had a snake in his asshole and it actually took him up on the social ladder. 
[01:40:00]  See, it was on the radio.  I heard that was on O.B. Anthony, too.  It was kind of cool.  I got a retarded guy with a snake up his ass in Shirley.  Billy.  Bigger than you.  Hey, this is Louis C.K.  You're listening to the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  And I don't know what else you're doing, but I hope you die soon.  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  All right.  Let me unzip.  Now go away. 
[01:40:30]  I remember these guys.  I remember these guys.  Oh.  Just these guys. 
[01:41:00]  The infamous liberator.  Has made its way into the studio.  What happened to O.B. and 2?  It's frozen right now.  You better get the cams going on Pal Talk because we have Sunset Thomas stopping in to say hi.  And Rebecca Love.  I wonder if that's her real name.  Ecuador's up 1-0 against Costa Rica.  Yes!  In case anybody cares.  Are you kidding?  Oh, yeah.  Did you say 1-0 again?  1-0.  Sorry.  Oh, my God, Bill.  It's my first week of World Cup coverage. 
[01:41:30]  Bill.  They're going to kill you now.  The Krauts won last night.  1-0.  All right.  And we also have Uncle Al here.  Al Jorgensen.  Ministry is in the house.  And there's a story about fucking an ostrich we have to get to, according to Steve.  Let's say hi to Dave in Boston.  Dave.  What's up, you rat bastards?  What's up, Dave?  Hey, man.  I just want to give you guys your Boston update.  You guys were on the Herald this morning saying that after Marconi left and then Roth was a disaster,  and then the Herald calling you guys the dynamic duos and saying that you get triple the advertisement rates with Roth. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, we're making money for BCN.  That's nice to hear.  Yeah, a little nice press for you.  Have you ever talked about that time you were on Fox 25 and that homeless guy stole your spot?  Oh, me?  Yeah, I actually gave you guys a tape of that.  We never played that audio.  Oh, I remember my stupid manager brought it over and there was nothing on it.  It's like a visual thing, too.  You really need to see. 
[01:42:30]  Your face is so priceless.  Savage animal.  Savage animal.  What is it?  It's a locut.  A local interview and then a homeless guy comes walking onto the set or something?  Yeah, and I just kind of interacted with him.  I think I gave him a dollar in the end of it.  Yeah.  But that was a while ago.  Yeah, my manager brought it over and it didn't have anything on it.  So I...  Great.  Who's the old guy out there?  Huh?  Who's the old guy?  Where?  Who's the old guy?  I don't know. 
[01:43:00]  Who is this?  Psst.  Who's the old guy?  Who is that?  Ask him who he is and who he's with.  Psst.  Who's that?  Who's the old guy?  Psst.  We get uncomfortable when there's old guys around.  Why?  You guys don't know radio.  Yeah, because they make references that, you know, we don't get.  All right, E-Rod's got the report.  Yeah, but it's fun to scare old people.  You boys like government cheese.  His name is Eddie.  He's with Sunset Thomas.  What do you mean, with? 
[01:43:30]  What do you mean, with?  I asked him, I was like, what does that mean?  He just, he points at it and he goes, with.  I said, okay.  And came back into the studio.  I don't know what is that about.  So we know he's rich.  All right, what do you want to do?  You want to bring in Uncle Al and then we'll bring in Sunset and Rebecca Love?  All right.  All right, let's get Uncle Al in here.  He's drinking his red wine.  Don't you love when you Google Opie and Anthony to see if the new stores are there  and it's shortlist announced for 2006 Edinburgh TV Fest and it's Anthony Fry and Lisa Opie? 
[01:44:00]  Ow!  There he is.  Look how glad it's doing.  What's up?  Seems like only yesterday I was here.  Yeah.  A little of both.  It's okay if you sit there and.  That's my wife, Angie.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one that hasn't divorced me yet.  Yeah, Angie, Zal's wife.  And she just asked.  Ask again.  We got the wireless mic, Angie.  Is there going to be a live sex act here or can I sit on this Shea Lounge? 
[01:44:30]  Well, you can sit for now.  Let's just put it that way.  Do you want to see a live sex act?  There has been.  Would your wife like to see a live sex act?  Oh, yeah, with me.  Yeah, all the time.  Yeah.  I'm not renting her out or anything.  No.  No.  We got other people for the sex act.  Does she just want to watch it?  Bring it in.  All right.  We're going to bring that in in a minute.  The same tone.  All right.  We haven't met this guy yet.  Who are you?  I'm Raven.  Bass player from Ministry.  Yeah, right on, man.  Also from Killing Joke. 
[01:45:00]  Killing Joke.  Oh, no kidding.  Oh.  Killing Joke's a shit.  Yeah.  He's a limey bastard.  Yeah.  T-bag.  I'm a t-bag.  He's a t-bagger.  I can hear that.  You guys like the wine, too.  Just enough.  Yeah.  Well, we're still drunk from last night.  Is that it?  You guys didn't make it to the show.  It was kick-ass.  Nah, not last night.  We have to be in bed by 8.30, man.  We go to bed when you wake up.  We're faggots.  Got to go to bed at 8 o'clock at night to get up at 4 in the morning. 
[01:45:30]  You guys are still going off.  Maybe for once we can at least act cool and go, yeah, man.  We stay up all night that we come in here.  Yeah, there we go.  Have our smoothies.  That's right.  Have your smoothies.  I missed the show.  He's got a bottle of wine.  I woke up with a needle in my arm.  Right.  Way to go, Courtney Opie.  Yeah.  Courtney Opie.  Fucker.  Well, when you're right, you're right, though.  Yeah.  But you guys are sipping the red wine.  That's a little weird.  No, it's not weird if you're still drunk from the night before. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  Well, there you go.  Yeah, that's taking it down like 81 notches for them.  Yeah, that's all.  He's drinking wine at like 9, 30, 10 in the morning.  That's that orange juice.  We were on the jacket about 7.  Yeah, that's like orange juice.  That's orange juice for rock stars.  Hey, there's probably more vitamins than there is in that orange juice.  That's right.  Vitamin G, man.  There you go.  Vitamin G, Bill.  Antioxidants.  That's right.  It's the cancer.  It helps the heart, too, right there, Al?  I heard all that shit.  Al, we've been playing your stories ever since you left last time. 
[01:46:30]  We do story time with Uncle Al.  All right.  Hey, what's the ostrich story about?  Oh, Steve comes running in here and goes.  All right, guys.  I don't know if America's ready for this one.  Savage animal.  Yeah.  An ostrich.  It is.  Fucking animal.  Is there a city ordinance about bestiality stories?  No, not at all.  Before noon, I can do a bestiality story?  You just can't show it.  You just can't show it.  Well, that's what that couch is for. 
[01:47:00]  You got the ostrich, too.  That's fine.  Whatever we can find, roadkill.  No, this is the sickest thing.  Look, man, a story's a story.  We don't know if it really happened.  No, no, no.  There's going to be no lie detector test being taken here.  I'll take one.  It happened.  It was.  Oh, it happened.  He wants to admit it happened.  I completely believe it.  I was trying to help you guys out.  I'm not over this yet.  And I've seen a lot of shit in my life.  But this.  When did this happen?  This.  Last tour in Europe.  Yeah.  Pretty weird.  All right.  So we dropped a couple tabs of acid. 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  Of course.  You're in Europe.  We're on tour.  And we're in Europe.  What else are you going to do?  That's their multivitamin.  Yeah.  Well, that goes with the antioxidants in the wine, right?  It goes in the bush mills.  It's cancer saving.  There you go.  Yeah.  We dropped a couple tabs.  And we went to a zoo.  All right.  I'm not going to name the city in Europe.  Because in case this ostrich is pregnant or something.  I don't want him to get back to us.  Hamster down.  Hamster down.  But I'm with my keyboard tech. 
[01:48:00]  And we decide, like, we're so wasted on this Sid, right?  That we decide, like, we're going to hide in the bathroom.  And wait until, like, security closes the place down.  So it's nighttime.  We're walking around this empty zoo trying to dodge security people.  That rocks right off the bat.  We walk past.  And we're tripping balls.  We walk past this fence.  And there's a goddamn ostrich with its head in the sand.  Or dirt or whatever.  Just totally, like, ass in the air.  And my keyboard tech goes, apie, jumps the fence. 
[01:48:30]  I don't even know what the hell he's doing.  He goes there, unzips, drops trout, and tries to put his dick in an ostrich that's sleeping.  Like, what is he thinking?  Is the ostrich not going to wake up and he'll get a quick shag?  I mean, first of all, how do you get hard when walking past an ostrich with its ass in the air?  You wouldn't even think of that.  And second of all, what is the ostrich pussy versus the ostrich ass?  He may be gay.  I have no idea, man.  You don't know where he's shoving it.  So he pulls his pants down to his knees and puts his dick in this ostrich. 
[01:49:00]  And this ostrich was pissed.  Well, what did you mean?  What did you mean?  Just smooth it away.  The thing...  No lube.  No, no lube, nothing.  And no foreplay.  That's just rude.  That ostrich is like a whore.  The thing gets his head out of it.  It's like, hurr, like Scooby-Doo, hurr.  Pulls his head out and is pissed off.  And starts kicking the living shit out of him.  He's trying to run from it, but his pants are down to his knees so he can't run. 
[01:49:30]  And I'm tripping my brains out.  I'm just like, this is fucked up.  This has scarred me for life, dude.  I had to climb the fence and distract the ostrich.  It's a rodeo sign.  So it comes after me.  And these things kick like a motherfucker, man.  Yeah, they'll rip you apart.  What the hell's going on here?  So we had to help each other over the fence.  And this ostrich would not quit.  It was throwing itself against the chain link fence.  Would you? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, of course.  If you're trying to nap and someone sticks their dick in you, I'm not stopping either.  I'm going to kick some fucking ass.  The best part is he didn't say a word.  He just went past the ostrich, saw the ass in the air, and got hard.  And said nothing.  Just jumped the fence.  I was like, what are you fucking doing?  And the next thing I know, it's out.  You get a song out of that or what?  Not yet.  It's a double album coming up.  Yeah, you got it wrong.  It's going to be on the double live album.  There's ministry with that new one, Ostrich Rape. 
[01:50:30]  Dude, you, you, you.  You know what scares me about bestiality?  It's like that, uh, have you ever seen that Hugh Manzi?  Oh my God.  Oliver.  Oliver, the Chimp Manzi.  You've never seen that?  No, no.  What's that about?  It's just too freaky.  Somebody had sex with a chimp, and the zygotes kind of mixed right.  And it's, it's totally creepy.  He's like an upright walking chimp that smokes cigarettes.  Oh, I didn't hear about that. 
[01:51:00]  I didn't hear about that.  It's grotesque.  I think you can find that on the internet, yeah.  I gotta see this, man.  You gotta goobie humans.  That can't be real.  No, they've been trying.  There is no way.  No, I swear.  Hold on, they're onto something.  They've been trying to prove.  There's a custody battle.  They're trying to figure out.  There is a custody battle.  No, they're right.  They're trying to figure out what this, uh, if it, if it's really just a human being,  and if something got screwed up, or if there's some ape shit in there.  Do you understand the laws of nature?  No one will fess up. 
[01:51:30]  It can't happen.  No one will fess up.  That's the thing.  But there are certain laws of nature that prevent that from happening.  No, no, but that's what I'm afraid of.  That's why we'll not name the zoo in case if there's, like, an ostrich boy that came out.  No, I don't mean laws, like, arresting laws.  I don't mean arresting laws.  I mean laws that keep fucking ostrich that plays the bass.  Right.  Dude, I don't know anything about it.  Laws that keep a, a, a penguin fish.  A seven-foot bassist with a huge ass and very thin legs. 
[01:52:00]  That likes to wear bullets.  That's me.  That's me.  That's me.  That's what I'm doing here.  That's right.  That actually is me.  All right, Ed, I know.  There is just no...  Hey, where's the sex act?  When's that happening?  Yeah.  Come on, bring it in.  Get the bird.  I could not sit in a bathroom in a closed area, tripping, waiting for a zoo to close.  I have a heart attack just doing that.  Not only did you guys do that, you waited and walked him by.  No, it was all good until he wigged out on me and just had like I can just fuck up everything,  can't they?  Because he saw an ostrich ass, got a boner, and freaked out on me. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, but he was tripping.  He didn't see an ostrich ass.  No, no, that's an excuse.  He saw a giant feathered pussy.  Oh, I'm tripping, man.  Ostrichs look great.  No, there is no excuse for that.  Yeah, you're right.  That's fucked up.  His story was the ostrich was asking for it.  They'll do that.  What do you think's going to happen?  The thing had garters on him.  That time at night?  Yeah.  Dude, you didn't hear that ostrich talking to me?  No, he just dropped a couple of feather dust.  It was asking for it.  Oh, no.  It was asking for it with his ass up in the air like that, sticking its head down. 
[01:53:00]  That's the only thing I'd think of, is like, he like, moralized it or whatever, and just  thought like, wow, man, wouldn't it be great to have a chick with her ass in the air like  that, and her head in the sand, and just went off, only it happened to be an ostrich.  Hey, I've got to ask you guys, so anything else in the zoo that night?  No, we got the hell out of there.  That's got to be creepy, to walk around a zoo at night, with no one around.  Especially tripping.  That was insane.  You dare each other to go into the lion cage a little bit?  No, we weren't even talking.  It was just like, we didn't say a word.  We were just walking around going, whoa, dude, whoa. 
[01:53:30]  Dude, can you imagine?  Jurassic Park, dude.  I know.  I just fucked a giant ostrich, what are you telling me for?  These guys fucked up, I love it.  Can you imagine how fucking quiet that must have been in a zoo, just you in the hand?  No, it was really creepy, dude.  It was completely creepy, and then it just got bizarre.  It all happened like in a split instant, and what do you do?  You're watching your friend dropping trowel on an ostrich. 
[01:54:00]  So it's like, and then the thing gets pissed, and you got to divert it.  So I had to climb the fence, too, and get in there and like wave my hands.  He sounds like one of those dudes in the extra, one of the extras in the accused who like watch the rape.  It all happened so fast.  I don't know what happened, man.  I mean, I was over there playing pinball, and the next thing you know.  I know.  Everything was fine, and it was interspecies rape.  On a pool table.  On a pool table.  The ostrich look like Kelly McGillis.  You can catch ministry at the Flamingo. 
[01:54:30]  No, you can't.  You can arrest ministry at the Flamingo.  Start out with something like a meerkat or something smaller than an ostrich.  Hey, no, no.  I have animals.  I don't approve of this.  This was something that was spontaneous.  Now you're going out on a limb.  No, I'm seriously taking a stand on this.  You're seriously saying fucking animals is wrong.  Right.  Wow.  More wine.  Call me square.  You're going to catch some shit for this.  He needs to cut some public service. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Ben, the boys need more wine.  Don't fuck your animals.  There you go.  More wine for the boys.  Oh, there's plenty.  All right.  Raping ostriches is wrong.  Yes.  That is so freaking funny, man.  That is a story and a half.  After I rape the ostrich, nothing will ever be the same.  I'm still scarred from this shit.  What about the ostrich?  Yep.  Well, yeah.  I didn't even think of that perspective.  That takes in counseling right now. 
[01:55:30]  Very lucky the ostrich.  I know when it sleeps now, it has its ass in the hole.  It's just fucking looking around, waking up, everything's sucking.  Head up, ass in hole.  Yeah, maybe I'll keep my head out of the fucking hole.  He's talking to all the other birds.  Fucking ministry.  It's teaching a rape crisis thing.  Can you imagine the teasing that's going on there?  The good thing is, there's in Europe where that kind of shit goes down every day.  Oh, yeah.  Wasn't in the U.S. a fucking day.  They're all filthy animals over there.  If anything, they're going to get sued for plagiarism or something like that. 
[01:56:00]  What the hell is this shit?  What do you guys...  Hey, Al.  What is this swag?  Hey, Al.  What?  Who?  Huh?  Al.  Al.  What do you guys think of the name Savage Animal for a band name?  That's all right.  I like the name Rising Sun Bandana.  Rising Sun Bandana.  Do you guys watch Supergroup?  Because they're trying to name that band and they wanted to name it Sebastian Bach.  It's got like Sebastian, Ted Nugent.  What was the name we came up with the other day? 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  Okay.  Coop.  Ostrich fucker.  No, no, no.  No.  Coop.  Coop.  Oh, the Ku Klux Clowns.  With just little Beatle covers.  Oh, wow.  That is brilliant.  That is brilliant.  Someone's going to steal that from you, man.  We're going to do it.  Clowns.  We'll come up with a better one.  It's like clan members of the Insane Clown Posse.  You just do, like, what, Beatle covers?  Just retwist the Beatle covers around a little bit. 
[01:57:00]  Around to make them a little politically incorrect?  Absolutely.  Speaking of the Beatles, Paul McCartney's wife, they're saying she was a prostitute.  I know.  I saw that.  Really?  Actually.  Yeah, man.  What do you think?  Kind of thinking about it.  I think it was her with her head in the sand and her ass in the air.  We're going to go around the kitchen on a skateboard with a couple of pounds of sugar.  And Paul's got an elevator up, which you've got to be.  Paul's turning 64 over the weekend, too. 
[01:57:30]  When I'm 64, he's finally here for good old Paul McCartney.  Oh, my God.  It's the end of the world.  When I'm 64, I'm going to be divorcing a one-legged hooker.  A one-legged ostrich.  Wasn't there to need him.  Wasn't there to feed him.  Get the fuck out.  You're a legless bitch.  Do you guys just sit around and think of band names?  Is that one of the things you do on the tour bus?  Yeah, we do that.  There's not a whole hell of a lot else to do.  Huh?  Chick punk band names.  Who's a clown?  Say something. 
[01:58:00]  Go ahead.  Clitty litter.  Wait, wait.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Here we are.  Chick punk band.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Clitty litter.  Axe wound.  Axe wound.  Clitty litter.  Clitty litter.  Clitty litter.  Protein skimmer.  Protein skimmer.  God, I should have bought the list.  Oh, exactly.  Oh, you got a whole list?  Yeah.  We got like 700 on the list.  Contagious.  Contagious. 
[01:58:30]  Eventually, we're going to just have like a whole stable full of these old chick punk  bands.  And that's all our label's going to sign is just chick punk bands that we name.  Oh, just keep pumping them out with your names.  Yeah.  Boom.  We're up to about like 20.  I can't remember any.  We got like 700.  These names are going to be taken on white band.  I'm sorry.  There's 700 on.  We have like 700 on why does a dog lick his balls.  Yeah.  Right.  And then like.  700 on that.  30 on the chick punk band names.  Wow.  We have a lot of time on our fucking hands.  A lot of like uterus jokes in there. 
[01:59:00]  Jeff Foxworthy would make a zillion dollars off.  Dilated to me, dude.  If you're a dog, it licks his balls.  Completely comedy specific.  Ministry at your cervix.  Only uterus jokes.  I love it.  Al, you never disappoint, I've got to tell you.  At your cervix.  At your cervix.  I'm delighted to meet you.  And you're calling your tour the Master Bait Tour?  Well, why not?  I've got the revolting cocks on there. 
[01:59:30]  Master Bait Tour, 2006.  God damn.  Unless we're just whacking it over.  Pitbull daycare, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They take care of our dogs.  Well, we're on stage.  The opening act takes care of the dogs.  They're the fluffers.  We brought our dogs.  The Pitbull daycare guys are the fluffers.  Another bestiality point.  No, we actually, we brought our dogs on tour for the first time.  Well, two of them, Ozzy and Lemmy are their names.  And they've gotten laid more than we have.  Really?  Yeah.  They're like, we've got some movies. 
[02:00:00]  We've got to show you.  Like I said, I'm not into that story.  Yeah, I hear you.  You can see the spike in peanut butter sales falling on the tour.  You know what I'm saying?  God damn.  Screw the music.  You guys should be doing comedy, man.  Any problems with the dogs?  Is that why you had to get supervision for them?  Yeah, they got an STD.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Someone fucked my dog. 
[02:00:30]  And somehow they got an ostrich STD.  That fucking ostrich, yeah.  Dude, that would be a weird animal.  Dog fucking an ostrich.  Dog strich.  Dog strich.  These guys, they're going to create the next virus.  You know what they're trying to find the first AIDS place?  AIDS was the fucking reason.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, we're going to call it H-I-Flying-V.  H-I-Flying-V.  Yeah, that AIDS thing just started in a zoo somewhere in Africa.  A band was traveling.  Yeah, you know what?  It's going to be a combination of a bird flu and AIDS. 
[02:01:00]  We can take credit for it.  Instead of going to some third world place like Haiti to start some shit right here, made in the U.S.  How did this new strand of Ebola come out?  Well, evidently, somebody from ministry raped an ostrich in a zoo.  And the people can't believe it.  Spread it through its dogs.  Believe me.  Believe me.  There was barely, barely any penetration before the ostrich got pissed.  Well, maybe next time.  Nobody's going to believe it.  Fuck that.  The government started it, man.  That's some bullshit. 
[02:01:30]  They did.  Did he come to the Builder Bird?  Hey, we got on the bus and he had a whole bunch of feather dusters.  He was like, tight to the dog, and we knew something was going on.  What are you doing?  Did he come?  No.  This thing was pissed.  And they're huge, too, dude, especially when you're tripping.  How did he reach it?  How tall was this guy that he could reach?  That's what I'm saying.  He was on his tiptoes.  This thing's huge.  I have no idea.  He didn't say a word.  He just jumped the fence and went at it. 
[02:02:00]  He didn't ask, like, you know, give me a leg up.  I want to try something.  He didn't give it any French kissing.  No clit tickling.  Nothing?  Trying to put it right in.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't even know if it was a dude or a chick, Austin.  I mean, how do you know that shit?  At that point, it doesn't really matter.  I just saw the fact that dude got...  I think you look for an Adam's apple.  It had really big knuckles.  I love how this dude just got instantly aroused.  It's like he saw it.  I know. 
[02:02:30]  Jumped over the face as his dick is coming out.  He's tripping, though.  He didn't see an ostrich.  No, you can't.  I don't care if you're tripping.  The males are bigger and have a much lovelier plumage.  I could walk past a million ostriches while tripping and definitely not get hard.  That's you.  That's him.  That's everyone.  He's got a bird for plumage.  What do I know?  I don't know.  All right.  It was fucked up.  I wouldn't fall asleep next to this guy.  I had to go in there and distract the thing.  That's warning.  And the thing was huge, and it was coming at you, and it was pissed.  I mean, pissed.  I've never seen a more pissed-off creature on this planet. 
[02:03:00]  With every reason to be.  Yeah.  No fucking way that guy should have tried to fuck him on.  They're just blaming the victim.  What an attitude on that fucking bird.  That fucking thing all pretty and colorful and shit.  Yeah, exactly.  Put a plume like that in the air?  What do you think's going to happen?  Hey, when do we get the live?  Are we allowed to stick around for the live sex act?  Yeah, bring them in.  Bring them in.  I'm not sure what's going on with them.  They brought in this Cleopatra Shea Lounge.  Come on.  If she puts her head on the ground and puts her ass in the air. 
[02:03:30]  She just gave us.  The human money box is here.  All bets are off.  The human money box.  They hooked us up with a bottle of whack juice.  Oh, good lube?  Yeah, excellent.  You guys look like you're having fun in here.  Lube is very important.  No fun a lot.  What's my mom doing here?  Give it to your Austin.  Hey, can you guys put on a couple feather dusters real quick?  Just around the ass.  That's my feathers.  What's my mom doing here?  We can make it kind of seem like a reenactment. 
[02:04:00]  It's been a while.  That's Sunset Thomas, everyone.  God, even her mic's shaped like a cock.  It's hard to talk into a mic shaped like a vagina.  I don't think they make this.  Sure put one out.  Mine does.  The Sure V-A-G-150.  You got to do something about the echo.  Sunset Thomas and Rebecca Love is your friend?  Correct.  Yes, she is.  Hello, Rebecca.  She's got some diamonds on there.  You make this really hot.  I know Raven.  And outside of maybe... 
[02:04:30]  Bite your finger off and swallow that motherfucker.  Wait for the shit.  He's shitting that out in Rikers.  You're talking about the huge diamond ring there.  Yeah.  I love you, baby, but I gotta go.  What does that diamond ring mean?  What does it mean?  It was just a gift from a friend.  Just a gift from a friend.  See, you got to remember, it's on the wrong finger.  It's not a wedding ring.  That must have been a hell of a lap dance.  Is it real?  It was a hell of a lap dance.  It was a hell of a lap dance.  Yeah, man. 
[02:05:00]  I know, 20 bucks, and I'm like, all right.  How many carrots is that?  That's huge.  Five.  Five-carat ring.  Yeah.  Wow.  The sun hits that.  It's a laser.  Would your boyfriend rape some chick in Colorado?  I don't have a boyfriend.  That's the only way I've ever seen a fucking chick get a ring like that.  I don't have a boyfriend.  I'm solo.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm enjoying it.  Nice.  Not anymore.  Look at the way Raven's savoring his chops.  He's got that ostrich look.  I got some Viber strip here today for you guys if you want any Viber strip. 
[02:05:30]  What is that?  We heard all about this stuff.  Yeah.  Wait, Al, you've heard it?  Al, just grab your mic and turn around.  Where do I sign?  Okay, Al, can I tell you what it's about?  Yeah, what does that do?  What is it?  It's a sex enhancer.  Can you put them on your eyes?  I'll give you 500 bucks if you put them on your eyes.  No, I'll be impressed if you put them on your eyes.  Wait, wait, wait.  You have to wait one second.  This is the second best story of the tour.  His roadie puts Listerine strips in his eyes for 50 bucks. 
[02:06:00]  That's got to burn like a motherfucker.  It's the hardest way in the world to make 50 bucks.  I give it to you.  His eyes are like that color.  He's holding up his wine.  He's like burgundy.  You can actually put that on your, you can put it on the nipple.  You can put it on the tip of your butthole.  And you go down on the cock and suck the cock and it actually starts getting it really nice and hot.  Wow.  I know, but it gets too hot.  That's the thing that worries me about these.  No, it doesn't get too hot.  No, these warming gels, it's like starts getting like a little bit cool and then all of a sudden it's like, well, when's this going to stop? 
[02:06:30]  Is my cock going to burn up like a fucking candle or what?  Like a ballpark Frank.  So you freak out.  If you put it on the tip of your butthole.  It's a Hebrew national.  My dick comes from a higher source.  If you put it on the tip of your asshole, you don't have to worry about it.  It just keeps tingling and you're getting bored.  Is there a tip of your asshole, by the way?  I'm trying to figure out.  Is there a tip of your dick?  Yeah, I have a little spike.  It's called a polyp. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, if you force out those duties, that's what I'm saying.  You stole it from the Ronald Reagan Museum.  I'm going to get my polyp circumcised someday.  Oh, shit.  Now, what do these things do?  Okay, what do you do is you take a piece of it like he's doing it and you put it in your mouth, but you let it melt.  It's got a good flavor to it.  You don't chew it like hubba bubba.  All of a sudden, after in a couple minutes, you start getting a sensation.  Oh, in your mouth?  It actually starts turning you on.  It's actually from male and female. 
[02:07:30]  And it's got a little, it's got a little breath thing as well.  It makes your breath smell.  So it makes you horny and good.  What happens if you put it in your eye?  I love it because it's all natural, too.  It's all natural, too.  What if you get really bored, you can just put them in your eye?  Honestly, if I take that, my head would explode.  I don't need that.  Look at you.  I need to chew something after looking at you.  Are you going to get horny?  Yeah, we do.  Well, it's not necessary.  Maybe you just wanted it like you're out partying or something and just kind of want to get a little.  I just want to put some in your eye.  Well, I'll get a little. 
[02:08:00]  It's like the new roofie, you know?  Oh, okay.  LSD strips.  That's what I was talking about.  I need something to chew that so girls will fuck me.  How does that happen?  You have that kind of pill?  You've got to have them have their head in the sand first.  It's for both.  It's coax.  It's coax.  Can you chew it if you have a beak?  You chew it.  You suck it.  You suck it.  Just curious.  So you suck on it, and it kind of gives a tingling, warming.  And if a girl puts this in her mouth and then gives a blowjob, it'll translate to the guy's... 
[02:08:30]  Do a lap dance while you're talking.  Do a lap dance while I'm talking?  Okay.  Did you pop one of those vibrate strips yet, baby?  There you go.  You're not supposed to fart when a chick gets on you.  He's farted, dude.  Did you just fart?  That's a typical bass player.  He's English.  He's English.  He's English.  It's all right.  It's the way we say hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Notice how fast she got up.  That's the way we show our love.  My jeans are still wet from last night. 
[02:09:00]  It's bird cum.  Holy shit.  You guys are busy, man.  I hear you guys all over the place.  We're taking over the world, man.  Yeah.  You guys rock.  That's it.  We're like the new Hitler.  Hitler light.  Blitzkrieg in our way from station to station.  Hitler light.  A few less casualties.  Have you heard this fucking show?  You have no idea, Al.  Yeah.  Not quite light.  Yeah.  Low in carbs.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  That's it.  All the fun of Hitler without that weight gain.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  My, my.  Side effects.  You know you said something fucked up.  Include racial cleansing.  You get a porn star going, oh, my.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  She's offended.  Hey, Ecuador scored again.  So, come out and see me, guys and girls.  It's two to nothing if anybody cares.  I don't think you want to hear something great that just happened to me recently.  Two nil.  All right.  What recently happened to you?  I just got a good gig in Las Vegas dancing with the ex-girls.  Really? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  You're mainstreaming it?  Yeah, I'm mainstreaming it.  That's it.  What do you got to wear?  You wear one of those big, heavy Vegas showgirl things?  Yeah, all the Vegas stuff.  Ostrich feathers.  Ostrich feathers on your head?  I know where you're going.  What fucking keyboard tech trying to fuck your mouth?  What's this other one about?  I don't know.  I just told her to scream and go, shut up.  I want to talk.  I never said that.  No, I...  Oh, you said that for me.  Is that Rachel Ray?  I don't know how to talk.  They released the unbroken and released all the ostriches.  Is it what?  Is that Rachel Ray? 
[02:10:30]  Rebecca Love.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Rebecca Love.  God, she's not watching that.  You know what?  It doesn't matter.  The redhead.  The redhead.  And what's your gig?  We got a redhead that will not speak here.  Just another porn star.  Yeah, another porn star.  Totally hogging the dildo mic.  You got to talk.  I like asking the porn stars this.  You won any awards at the...  Nominated.  Best Oral.  Best Oral?  Mm-hmm.  Only nominated?  You didn't win?  Well, I was up against Vivid Girls.  I mean, how you win against a contract.  Vivid Girls can suck some cock. 
[02:11:00]  You're right there, honey.  Well, hey, at least I was nominated with them.  It's better to be nominated than to not be nominated.  Bullshit.  Than to be an ostrich.  Oh, really?  You want to win?  You want to win?  Yeah, but she's saying it's rigged.  Like those Vivid Girls have the inside track.  Really?  Yeah.  It's all rigged.  She's like the Kansas City Royals.  She's going up against the Yankees.  The odds were against me.  The Yankees.  They're a butt team over there at Vivid.  Yeah.  A butt team.  I just want to know if you, Yankees, did you have these mics specially made for this? 
[02:11:30]  These chicks, because that's, that is so fucking cool.  That is not like any mic I've ever used.  It's wireless with a big battery on the bottom.  If I used mics like that, I would be gay.  These are pretty heavy.  Yeah.  That is the gayest mic.  Big mic.  I'm trying to work out.  They totally like start sucking dick if I use my, they look like totally like the testicles  at the bottom.  Yeah, there's a ball bag at the bottom.  It's really designed well.  There's a vein up the front of it.  And you guys look so good holding them.  Isn't it?  Look at that.  And your best oral nominee, go ahead. 
[02:12:00]  Will you stop touching my penis?  Oops.  I think my penis is laughing.  Wrong again.  There you go again.  Maybe that's why you didn't win.  You don't know how to cup the battery pack.  Yeah, stop touching the balls.  Just cup that battery pack.  You know, there we go.  At the bottom.  Yeah.  With a little tickle.  A little tickle.  See?  There you go.  She was a vivid girl.  She would have won.  That's fucking bullshit.  I know.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Totally rigged.  You got robbed.  I'm taking my cock and going home.  Until you fuck to get to the top.  You know, it's like I took it in the face. 
[02:12:30]  I licked his ass.  What more do I have to do?  These fucking vivid girls.  I don't even.  She barely even used her hand.  And I fucking lose.  The technique was not there, damn it.  Yeah.  What about anal?  I do so much.  Because I watch a lot of shit.  I've seen a lot of shit.  You do anal, yeah.  You know I do.  Oh, you do.  Hey, yeah, I know.  Have I ever fucked you in the ass?  I'm trying to think back now.  Yeah, you did.  Wait a minute.  Was there that one time?  Yeah, but the question is, did you feel it? 
[02:13:00]  Weren't you in Rest Area 6?  I was working for Vivid.  I'm not a Vivid girl.  Rest Area 6.  The new sex motel.  Rest Area 6.  Only she had short black hair and her name was Bob.  I do remember now.  If anybody asks, I'm in Austin.  Did you feed it the glory hole?  That's it.  You get a nice buddy through the glory hole at the rest stop.  That's nice.  One finger comes through.  Ask you to...  That wasn't his finger. 
[02:13:30]  Nah.  No.  A little short stack.  You banged her at the Super Rape?  That wasn't his finger.  The Super Rape.  It was at the zoo or something.  I can't recall.  You've won any awards for Best Anal?  Oh, God.  I haven't shot in two years, man.  I've been so busy doing that.  You haven't shot?  I haven't shot a movie or anything.  Oh, I thought you meant like...  Yeah, in two years.  You shoot something out of your ass when they fuck you.  I've been so busy doing a lot of mainstreams.  And I got two of my own gentleman clubs as well, which I just sewed those.  See, you've gone legit.  Well, no, I didn't say I'm out.  You sold out, man. 
[02:14:00]  I'm just taking a break.  I'm just taking the money and investing it and making money.  Sold out, man.  You quit doing Rest Area 6.  You sold out.  She bought in.  I'm busy with my gentleman clubs.  Yeah.  It sucks when your favorite porn star sells out, man.  Wow.  Nothing.  Dude, I liked it when she was underground.  Yeah.  You know, I liked it when you were underground and only a few people knew about you.  I know.  On 8 millimeters.  Then you started doing porns with condoms.  Yeah, condoms.  And ostriches.  Ostriches? 
[02:14:30]  You wouldn't take it up the ass anymore.  You're selling fucking bread strips.  What?  You're not into that scene?  You didn't hear that?  I tried to stick with my own station.  You didn't hear that story?  Hey, good girl.  Total sellout.  Yeah.  I never bought in.  Great.  She won't fuck a panda bear.  Jesus Christ, what a prude.  A vivid girl would fuck a panda bear.  I'm not into black and white.  This is 2006, not 1956.  Panda bears are basically mulattoes.  Are they?  Because they're black and white. 
[02:15:00]  Chew this.  It's eucalyptus.  It'll make you want to fuck a panda bear.  You can fuck them.  Just don't bring them home to your parents.  Jesus.  Ling Ling!  What the fuck is this?  This is like National Geographic porno.  All together.  I've never heard so much bestiality in one conversation.  Jesus Christ.  At this time of the morning.  Thank you.  Ministry?  There's a city ordinance.  Usually we keep ostrich fucking until afternoon.  Are you guys going to the bathroom after?  They did the zoo thing already. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, they did.  It's a real story with an ostrich.  What, you've had sex with animals?  Yeah, like people like you, you mean?  Yeah.  Oh, you're going to take that?  I'm mortally wounded.  You're going to take that?  Oh, my God.  I'm going down.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Ah.  Hey, good for you, spider.  Good for you.  You keep this.  You keep this.  I love sex with animals.  Yeah.  She loves sex with animals.  Yeah, why not?  A nice pony?  Oh, yeah.  A nice, no, donkey. 
[02:16:00]  You know what?  Donkey.  Donkey.  Who hasn't watched the portion of your asses?  Hey, you got to fuck mules because they can't get you pregnant.  Have you been there?  She looks like she'd ride an owl.  I don't know why.  Owl.  Right away?  That'd be cute.  Ride a what?  She's got that little owl face.  Owl?  Yeah, like an owl.  Sex with owls?  Yeah.  And you think I'm weird?  Dude.  What are you talking about?  How do you fuck an owl?  I'll make your head spin, baby. 
[02:16:30]  I'll make your head spin.  You have issues, dude.  Hey, you fucking winked at me.  You want to know what's happening?  It was hitting on me, I swear.  Of course.  The guy that had the fucking ostrich is yelling at you.  How do you do doggie style with an owl?  You must explain.  You just put them over there and then you turn their fucking head around.  You got all planned out.  And you don't have to worry about them fighting back like those big pain-in-the-ass ostriches.  That's right.  What happens if the zygotes mix and you have a little owl human baby? 
[02:17:00]  That ain't ever happening.  You are so fucked.  I'll send the payment.  Knock, knock, knock on the door.  You know what?  The best thing.  Who?  Who?  Who's your dad?  Yeah.  The best thing about fucking an owl, you can fuck them in the ass while they're looking  at you.  With one eye.  The ever-staring eye.  Dude, you have serious issues.  You need therapy.  You've been thinking about how to fucking ass fucking owl.  No, you fucking did it.  You didn't do it.  The keyboard's a good one. 
[02:17:30]  I didn't do it.  You watched it.  I was the distraction from the pissed off ostrich.  I didn't fucking owl.  Oh, now he's the hero.  You're fantasizing.  You stood by while the ostrich got fucking raped and you did nothing about it.  And you helped the rapist get away.  I know.  That's what the fuck you did.  I'm an accomplice.  I gotta admit.  But.  Wow.  The owl thing, I can't even rap my mind.  Yeah, do they even have feet for doggy style?  Do they even have a pussy?  Don't they need, don't you need knees to get a girl into doggy style?  Do they even have fucking, you ain't ever seen her feet? 
[02:18:00]  I know.  He's talking about doggy style on an owl.  No, the reason, I said, what I said was she looks like she'd ride an owl.  There was something about her face.  It just, I don't know.  It just reminded me of that.  What do you guys think?  Would you fucking owl?  God damn.  Who would have thought it came back on me?  You would fucking owl?  No, I wouldn't.  Not even if it clipped us now.  Couldn't get you pregnant, supposedly.  There's some, like, there's some severe honesty going on here right now.  Yeah.  What's the worst thing, like, situation you've had to do during your job in porn where you 
[02:18:30]  walked away, you had the money going like, oh, fuck, that really, like.  I actually did the same one time with a chick and her pussy kept farting in my face.  Right in your face.  She's a bass player.  I know.  Comment on that.  Was she English?  I actually didn't get turned on by that.  Yeah.  All right.  So you left kind of feeling like, oh.  That's different from any other chick how.  Yeah.  Wow.  What position were you, like 69 in or? 
[02:19:00]  69 in.  Yeah.  She just farted her ass off.  Yeah, man.  What a slob.  Jesus.  It was gross.  Echo.  Echo.  Echo.  Told her.  God damn.  You should have told her.  Hey, you farted in my face with this thing.  You gotta stop farting in my face.  Honey, it's like eating an exhaust.  You told her that?  Yeah.  Do you say that shit on the set?  Yeah.  I don't give a shit.  Man, you gotta quit squirting or farting.  Well, I like it when they squirt now.  I love it when they squirt.  Squirting is hot.  Listen, but it's different when they really have no orgasm, they squirt off.  I know.  That's hot, right? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, it tastes good, too.  I love squirt.  Oh.  I like to put on the scuba mask and the snorkel.  Squirt is rude.  Snorkel, man.  Your wife loves this, huh?  She don't give a crap.  She's a squirter.  She's a squirter.  Wow.  She's like, shut up.  Now she's giving you that ex-nay.  You never know who's listening.  Oh, now we're getting too personal, Al.  Real simple.  Yeah.  Squirting good, farting bad. 
[02:20:00]  Rules to live by, Lloyd.  Rules to have sex by.  With people.  With people only.  Animal.  I gotta sneak out.  Words to live by, Lloyd.  Oh, Opie.  I gotta sneak out.  I gotta leave.  But you guys continue.  He's gotta go watch golf.  We're not important enough.  Just hang out.  Drink, motherfucker.  Fucker.  He's gonna blind date the vet reclinic.  What?  Look, she's already got it.  I can't hear you.  Go on.  God damn, they're handing out dildos.

She gets to keep that.  She gets to keep that.  Hey, I want the wack juice.  Wash that first.  Get the warming wack juice.  What the hell is that?  That's one for you.  That's the tongue joint.  Is that a tongue in a bag?  Forget about it.  He just forget about it.  What kind of Jeffrey Dahmer shit is...  I can show.  If I can pull up to the snatch in the box, I'll have a tongue to go. 
[02:21:00]  The guy just like...  He just took it and stole it.  What is that?  It's a face?  It's a tongue and mouth in a bag that you just stick your dick in?  It's a little bullet that you put on your tongue and it vibrates.  Oh, that'd be great when EMS is trying to pry it out of your throat.  You can mix your cocktail.  You can mix your cocktails.  Anthony, that's awesome.  Man, put it in your eye.  I did a Robin recommends on that.  Put it in your eye.  Is that what...  That thing, you need that right there.  I thought it was like a male jerk toy thing.  No, no. 
[02:21:30]  These guys are way more sophisticated than that 30s shit.  It's like a little vibrating bullet that you strap to your tongue.  No, it's a vibrating bullet.  You strap it to your tongue.  I bet you if you put the Viber Strip on that with it, it'd be intense.  You might go back in time, lady.  Don't stop mixing your ass toys.  What the hell is this?  Don't stop mixing your toys.  Hey, I'm Rachel Ray and I make...  It's a camera, honey.  20-minute meals.  That's what I just...  What is this?  Inner space?  What is that?  I don't know what that is.  It's like a Star Trek dildo.  They're going to fuck the camera. 
[02:22:00]  That's a camera.  Oh, it's a camera.  All right, you first.  No, you first.  The camera that's now off.  I was trying to say she looked like an owl.  Yeah, I know.  I saw that.  Raven, you look...  Her looking like one and fucking one is two different things, though.  Hey, it's Judy.  I never said that.  It's Judy.  Okay, there are eight different conversations going on here.  I haven't even done anal-in-in-law before you didn't even stick the camera.  See what happens when Opie leaves the room?  It's so awesome.  If you go to our website.  Our anchor's gone.  Way to fucking go, porcelain.  I have the rabbit.  Steve is handing out the dildos right now. 
[02:22:30]  That's something called...  I have that.  Let me get everybody's attention for a minute.  All right, all right.  What is that that Steve is holding right there?  It's the rabbit.  That is the rabbit.  Now, that's pretty famous.  Yeah.  That's pretty famous as a sex toy.  It has kind of a rotating ball bearing thing at the top.  And then it's got something that...  Like a fork down on that.  Yeah.  It's like the rabbit.  Oh, no.  It's like the rabbit.  The top of the penis part swivels.  And then the other thing, either that is a warp drive or it does the clit.  It looks like a...  And then it's got a remote control for speed. 
[02:23:00]  It's like a drunken Nazi.  And turn it up!  It's like a drunken Nazi.  Have you seen that movie Anaconda?  I'm going to go out on a limb here.  Hey, there's enough drunken Nazis in here already.  What are you kidding me?  Is there any way we can get a demonstration of how that works?  I'm talking Steve C.  Up your ass.  Anyway, no.  Is there any way?  Put that in your pussy.  I dare you.  We got lube.  All right, we'll compromise.  You want to do it?  We'd like to take that for a test drive.  Rebecca, you've got to do the Viber strip with it.  Can you do the Viber strip?  You've got to do the Viber strip.  Because we want a little bit of a sex show here for the Rockstars. 
[02:23:30]  I'll let you guys hear you.  Are you sure you don't want me to take it?  Oh, yeah.  All right, baby.  No, you're going to take it because I'm going to take it.  I'll stand up so I can get a good look and describe the action.  Raven, don't fart, man.  Don't fart in towel.  You want a bird's eye view?  You put it in your mouth.  All right.  She's putting the Viber strip in her mouth.  She's sucking on it.  I'm into people now.  People power.  What kind of sensation are you getting there?  It's like a mystery in town.  It's a little, but tingly.  It takes away bad breath.  I'll say that. 
[02:24:00]  You're like hot as a little firecracker.  God damn it.  You don't want bad breath when you're going to be sticking your mouth on a pussy.  I was just being profound there for a minute.  That is very poetic.  All right, now, lube.  We need lube immediately.  I have some.  We're not talking out of your tap.  Lotion boy.  Lotion boy.  Her panties are coming off.  That's very nice.  And Anthony, Ecuador is still up two to nil.  Thank God, because that's the important part.  In the 75th minute. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, my God.  The panties are on the head.  Try one of mine.  The Englishman has panties on his head.  I just gave a porn star some lube.  Look at that.  All right.  We got a little bit of snatch going on over there.  That's very nice.  Good morning.  They're on the little couch we got in here.  A little tapping going on.  Something I'm not hungry.  Why don't you put a Viber strip on my clit?  Hey, how about that?  Put a Viber strip on her clit.  Put it in your eye.  Put it in your mouth.  Put it in her eye.  I still want to say it in the eye.  Put it around the brown eye.  No, get it right in. 
[02:25:00]  The tapping.  Open septuagenarian.  Now, we have lube.  Did we have lube?  Are we going to have to use Brokeback Mountain spit on it lube?  Hey, that was the sexiest part of the movie.  I love you.  I actually went into that thinking it was a horse fucking movie.  I was very disappointed.  I can't quit clit.  All right.  Well, now she's lubing it herself.  Look at that.  A little action going on there.  Raven.  Damn, don't you think I've seen enough unpleasantness for one day? 
[02:25:30]  Don't get it.  Would you rather have a couple of fucking ostriches in here?  Raven, what are you doing?  We got some pussy licking going on there.  She didn't even have to do anything.  And then there's...  No, but her.  What do you think this is, Avenue Q?  At least put a pinky up her butt or something, man.  Don't put a pinky up her butt.  I can't.  Is that like a baby mouse?  Look.  Look.  Pretend she was an ostrich.  Her ass is in the air.  You're walking by and you're tripping. 
[02:26:00]  Think about it.  All right.  The rabbit is going to get used here.  I believe some lube going on there.  Yeah, that's my lube.  Don't...  Hey, be spare.  Hey, that works good.  God damn it.  I need it for me.  Oh, she's jacking.  She's jacking the mechanical cock.  And lubing it all up.  And then we'll turn it on and see how this thing works.  Did you put some of the strip on her clit?  Yeah, I licked her pussy.  All right.  No, wait.  Is that thing on the part that spins around like a drunken Nazi?  Like a drunken Nazi. 
[02:26:30]  I think she would do with it.  What do we do with it?  Do we do it for a scene?  Do we do it for you guys?  Yeah.  I'm so fucking wet right now.  Are you?  No.  No, of course not.  Did you just say, I'm spying slice?  I was doing the old pewter, the big pewter beer stein song that they do during October.  Your head's in the way.  You know what creeps me out is your cameraman.  He never shows any emotion.  And he's a total voyeur, man.  He's a pervert.  He's like a bicycle seat sniffer.  He's like the brooder of pussy. 
[02:27:00]  Turn it up.  He's waiting for her fucking head to come apart.  He's a creepy fuck, man.  He's a creepy fuck.  Turn it up.  Yeah.  All right, but if I get shocked.  What are you going to get shocked?  Get in there.  Zoom lens, motherfucker.  Zoom in.  He knows how to direct porno.  Yeah.  Turn it up.  Okay, right there.  It's getting in there.  All right.  Is the thing tight?  What is that?  Are you actually getting hot?  I can't hold everything.  You're actually getting hot, aren't you? 
[02:27:30]  I can tell.  You're like reading different.  Use the wand on her clit.  What the hell is that?  It's a floss machine.  Use the wand on her clit.  Spin that rabbit around.  Stick the other part up her ass.  Look at that.  Get some cute tips for her ears.  She's got a desk lamp.  I want something up her nose.  She doesn't have a hole in her abdomen.  Put it in her ass.  Spin it around.  It's a crash test.  What the hell is the floss machine for?  Oh, I got it.  The floss machine?  What is that thing?  That's a magic wand.  All right.  That's so it can reach those hard to get out of her ass.  Put the other part up her ass. 
[02:28:00]  That's supposed to be...  Oh, she's got the little Hitler mustache.  Right now, I don't know what's working.  It looks like a pubic.  It looks like they're digging for a tumor.  A Hitler mustache.  I wish my masseuse would do something like this.  What the hell's your mustache?  You're actually getting hot.  That's awesome.  It's got tight pussy, man.  Uh-oh.  That's because there's a barbecue in it.  Fucking Weber grill.  Look what you got going on there.  The woman's...  She's swallowing a hibachi with a vagina. 
[02:28:30]  There's a lot of machinery going on down there.  We got a basic fondue kit going on.  That is a lot of machinery down there.  Let's listen to the port of dialogue.  Yeah, here we go.  Go ahead, girls.  Give us the dialogue.  You're on.  I like that, don't you?  Oh, you little bitch, you.  Yeah, fuck my cock.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, this time with feeling.  But that's not your cock.  Don't ruin it, Al.  It's a mechanical argument.  There it is. 
[02:29:00]  Okay, right there.  Oh, yeah.  I think cheese is true.  The fucking limey's farting again.  Come on it for me, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Fuck, I can't even fake it.  Oh, wow.  Did you really fucking come?  No.  There's not.  Of course not.  I didn't think so.  There's too many people laughing.  I love it.  Fuck, I can't even fake it.  That's honesty.  I like that.  She was honest. 
[02:29:30]  She takes too many people around.  I can't even come.  You're absolutely right.  That's why you're a star.  Steve, get out.  I'll never make it.  Hey, your cameraman's creepy, dude.  We know.  Who's that?  And he's a mix between a white guy and a black guy.  And an ostrich.  And an ostrich.  I'll tell you what.  He's the panda.  He's got some serious DNA issues, man.  He's an ancestor of Thomas Jefferson.  That's true.  Yeah, that's it.  Hold the vibrator against the microphone.  That worked well.  Ow.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  The hell was that?  No, wait, wait.  Hey, fam.  What's harder to control?  This or the Tippi Tom interviews?  You guys got an encore coming up.  I love how Obie just ran out on this.  You got to do an encore.  We have to do it.  Oh, you're going to do it next?  No, I don't think we want to see them do an encore.  Unless it's ostrich fucking.  Unless it's anal.  I don't want to see the tip of the ass.  I don't want to see what that looks like.  You don't want to see my tip of my ass.  I want to see the tip of her ass.  She's not doing it.  The tip of my ass has like a polyp problem. 
[02:30:30]  Could we see your blowjob technique?  Can I pick on that?  Because I want to see what came in second.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  We think you should have won.  Yeah, let me see the blowjob technique.  Put down the wine, pick up the cock.  On anything.  The plastic thing, the wand, the English guy.  Okay.  Whatever you want to use.  All right, first.  That's a good name for you.  Give the girls a lesson.  See, now we're learning.  Put down the wine, pick up the cock.  Give the girls a lesson.  I use my hand as an extension of my mouth.  Uh-huh.  So when I get down, I'm not going to talk. 
[02:31:00]  I'll just show you.  Okay, she's awesome.  I'm not going to talk.  And I do a twist to the arm.  Oh, it's a radio girl.  Twist.  Mm-hmm.  It's like a child-proof cat.  And some guys like you to squeeze hard, and some guys want it soft.  Yeah.  But then you go down to get more wetness on it.  Right.  We want it length.  Like really hard.  And you swallow to deep throat it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You swallow it like food, and you get further down.  It is food.  I swallow it like food.  It's like a fun claw part.  What do you mean?  I don't understand.  That's awesome.  Just kind of demonstrate.  That's great.  Quote of the day. 
[02:31:30]  The rubbery stuff tastes nasty.  Yeah, it tastes a little nasty.  But then you're using your hand.  There's a wine bottle.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Forget the rubbery stuff.  We got an English guy here.  It's almost rubbery.  It's okay.  It's almost a penis.  But at the same time, I'm like grabbing the balls, and I'm holding it.  The penis with fat teeth.  Maybe that's why you came in second.  And then as you go down on the cock, you do the shrug.  Where are you from?  Upstate New York.  Oh, now we're getting a demonstration. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  But the best way to give a blowjob is have the guy go over you 69 so you can toss the salad,  lick the balls, and booby at the same time so you're like multitasking.  Wow.  All right.  I like how she brings the high-tech world of business terminology into sucking cock.  That was nice.  No problem.  That was nice.  And that came in, Jesus Christ.  That came in second?  What came in first?  The corporate takeover.  They judge on the movie. 
[02:32:30]  The woman had a vagina on her chin.  Yeah, the little man got shagged.  With their mainstream dick sucking.  They call her old pussy chin.  I want to know how you would fuck an owl or suck an owl off after you had your own fantasy.  Go for a six-knock owl.  First you move the feathers.  Do you reach around the owl?  I don't even know if they have a dick or pissy.  Next time you have a gig in Portland, someone on your bus is going to do it.  There'll be some spotted fucking owl up there.  No, you're up.  I'm up there.  There's laws against that here. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, you always keep it in another country.  All right, Vancouver.  All right, you know something, hey, I would love to stay here and watch these girls suck  on anything that even resembles a penis, but it's about that time.  Any plugs?  I want everybody to get their plugs out.  Guys, gentlemen.  Fuck you.  We don't shill shit.  Fuck you.  All right, you ostrich watching that fuck motherfucker.  We are where we are, and if you're not, you're a fucking asshole.  That's the best plug I've ever heard in my life. 
[02:33:30]  Thank you for tuning in.  We'll see you tomorrow, man.  Hey, this is the Alien for Ministry, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's all get naked and hug in the woods.  Yeah, look at my cock.  Very nice.  Yeah, look, you're all shaved and I'm all shaved.  You've got to respect that.  I considered the cock.  We'll suck dick for friendship.  I don't want people looking at me shoving this hog in my mouth.  Why?  Don't take the whole penis in your mouth.  Why?  You're going to gag for sure.  Oh, gosh.  So you're going to perform oral sex on him? 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  You can lick and kiss and suck and do whatever you like.  I love him.  And do that up the shaft of the penis and along the side and around to his testicles.  And then you take just the head of his penis in your mouth.  That's all.  Open their mouth real wide and shove that in.  And you drill.  Great quantities of saliva down the shaft of his penis.  What a great blowjob technique.  Holy crap.  Grip the penis very gently with your hands.  I think it made me a little butt sass. 
[02:34:30]  Then let him use the dildo.  Put it in.  Pull it out.  How'd you like it in your shitter?  I like to lick ash.  This is great.  It's not gay if you're single.  These two homos know a lot about sucking dick.  You got it down to the science, it sounds like.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  First of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Let me unzip.  Let's say hi to Dawn in New York.  Dawn.  Hi.  How you doing?  Whoa. 
[02:35:00]  How's sexy, Dawn?  What's up, Dawn?  We finished with politics, oil, and dogs.  What's that, sweetheart?  We finished with the politics, the oil, and the dogs.  What would you like to talk about?  Yeah.  What do you want?  I want to know, what about, do you ever play Tom Waits?  Well, Tom Waits is kind of a classic rock or slower. 
[02:35:30]  Do you mean on the show?  Why would we play Tom Waits?  You like the, what's your favorite Tom Waits song?  Oh, come on.  He's got like 20 albums out there.  No kidding.  But if you want to play one, you can play God's Way on Business.  Oh.  But you don't have Tom Waits, do you?  No, we don't.  No.  And this is a radio station?  Hey, look.  Cutting edge.  You're preaching to the choir.  Oh, my God.  Listen, you deep-voiced dyke.  Listen, you disgusting-sounding whore. 
[02:36:00]  What do you think?  Are you familiar enough?  You're not familiar enough with this to know it's a talk show, dummy?  Do you call up Larry King and request a song, you idiot?  You are a dunce.  We didn't spend years and years honing our craft so we don't have to play music so we can take calls from you.  Man voice.  Hey, man voice.  Ooh, you're hurting me now.  Yeah, you know I am.  Ooh.  Ooh, you're hurting me now. 
[02:36:30]  Hey, all right, Herman Munster.  Listen to that.  Why don't you smoke 18 more cigarettes this hour?  18?  Yeah.  You're giving me credit.  Yeah.  What are you listening to right now?  Ugh.  Tom Waits.  No, you're not.  What radio station are you listening to?  I thought I was listening to the Cutting Edge.  What are you talking about?  God, I hate you.  What radio station?  What radio station are you listening to? 
[02:37:00]  Uh, K-92-3.  When did they remove your ovaries to give you that voice?  When did you ever hear the station play Tom Waits?  Did you have your whole...  You had a complete removal of your female organs and no more female hormones are pumping through your body, right?  And what's that got to do with playing Tom Waits?  What's it got to do?  I'm right, though.  Yes.  Hey, Manhattan mini storage womb, we're trying to ask you a question.  Oh.  Better off without a wife?  Is that the song you want to hear?  That thing just ends like it was bricked off. 
[02:37:30]  After they removed all the goody parts.  Yeah, she had the procedure that's called the old ice cream scoop.  Oh.  Take it all out and leaves you with a nice mustache and goatee.  But my ears work fine.  Do they?  Oh, God.  You really did have...  I can hear my voice is horrible.  I don't give a damn about it.  No, you do.  It hurts you, doesn't it?  No.  It hurts you.  I've been living with it for 52 years.  52 years.  Do you like Tom Waits because he has a more feminine-sounding voice than you do? 
[02:38:00]  Exactly.  I think he has a melodic voice.  Melodic.  God, that voice.  When did you get divorced?  When did your husband leave?  Same time your womb did?  Huh?  He's still here.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunately for him.  Well, listen, Tranny.  Is he...  Are you happily married?  At times.  Are you attractive?  Are you kind of fat?  Are you a lovely-looking girl?  Someone is very confused. 
[02:38:30]  They're saying it's Chris from Long Island.  I can't go to his phone call right now.  He's saying, is this Tom Waits calling in to request Tom Waits?  Hey, Chris Sarandon from Dog Day Afternoon.  What exactly made you think that this station...  You're not dying, Sonny.  You're killing everyone around you.  What makes you think that we played Tom Waits on this?  This is a talk show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is anybody in the station later?  No.  Not on the cutting edge. 
[02:39:00]  Not on the station.  92.3, the cutting edge.  Well, isn't he cutting edge?  No.  Well, what is he?  He's an older man.  No one...  An older man?  You ask...  You ask...  You ask...  You ask...  You ask...  You ask...  You ask...  Lily, Lily, Grandpa, could you play Tom Waits, Grandpa?  You ask...  You ask...  You ask...  You ask...  You ask...  The Rolling Stones or anything like that on this station.  Yeah.  You're too old.  The Rolling Stones are your ovaries. 
[02:39:30]  Fine, fine, fine.  Make all the jokes you want, but you don't play Tom Waits.  Toot in common womb.  That's right.  You don't play Tom Waits, and I don't reproduce.  So we're even.  My son about that one.  How old's your son?  13.  Really?  And he loves Tom Waits.  I couldn't love Tom Waits.  Enough about Tom Waits.  Really?  She probably just plays it 24 hours a day in our house. 
[02:40:00]  Happens.  No one knows what to do with Tom Waits.  Tom Waits...  The radio programmers have never figured out what to do with Tom Waits.  Sure they have.  Don't play him.  Maybe they should try playing him.  Yeah.  And then what happens?  Everybody will buy his CDs.  And then everyone will stop buying iPods?  Throw his CDs in the same bio-waste container your woman parts are in.  That's what I say.  How about this?  We'll play Tom Waits.  If you can tell me how old he is. 
[02:40:30]  He is 58.  He'll be 59 in December.  I lied, bitch.  Why am I not surprised?  Do you know who you're talking to, even?  Yeah.  Do you know the name of this show?  Opie and Anthony.  What do you know about Opie and Anthony?  I know you mellowed a lot since you came to this station.  Oh, damn.  That's going to hurt.  We did.  In what way, ma'am?  In what way? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  You just talk about dog tricks and oil.  Dog tricks.  Oil and dog tricks.  What's a dog trick?  All right.  Speaking of oil, how much of it do you need for your husband to have any satisfaction?  The dog ate the person's toe.  Woo-hoo.  Woo-hoo.  Hey, it's Howard.  Yeah, that's a real story.  Yeah, but then it led into old people getting eaten by their pets, which was a fine conversation.  So, miss, you don't think it's worth talking about when a dog eats its owner's toe off and 
[02:41:30]  she doesn't notice it?  You don't think that's worthy of making fun of?  Kind of funny.  You're a tough one.  It doesn't faze me in the least.  Of course it doesn't, because you probably have three toes left, old sugar feet.  Yeah.  What happened to your parts?  You go a little too deep with the peanut butter?  That was enjoyable.  Eddie, you know, Marilyn, I don't have any womanly parts. 
[02:42:00]  Grandpa, could you whip me up some ovaries?  You have to take my womb.  Darn, darn, darn, darn.  Go to the hospital, Grandpa.  I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't.  Get in, Dragula, Heyman.  I'll take you. 
[02:42:30]  Grandpa.  I'd love that, Demarole.  Bye-bye.  Oh, she went away.  Oh, boy.  Damn her.  Whip me up some ovaries, Grandpa.  Grandpa, I need fallopian tubes.  Okay, Heyman. 
[02:43:00]  God damn, I hate her.  Dawn.  Tom Waits.  Not for Tom Waits.  God, what's that funny?  Where did that come from?  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  We'll step aside.  Don't play the casey.  We're late.  It's amazing.  She doesn't like the show, so we immediately imply that she has no womb.  But I think we were right.  But just, hey, I'm not enjoying your show. 
[02:43:30]  All right, let's attack the heart of our humanity.  Oh, God.  Hey, I'm not taking your show.  Ha-ha.  You can't reproduce.  We are horrible.  Right.  He's the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Look who's in studio.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  What's going on, guys?  We miss Bill. 
[02:44:00]  I'll miss you guys, too.  I'm trying to swallow some food here.  Out there.  It's a tender moment.  I'm seriously, like, I'm, like, giddy.  It is good seeing you.  Yeah, it's great to be here.  You don't see you that much.  Move back to New York.  What are you doing out there in L.A.?  Trying to make it and stuff.  Come back to New York.  I know, I know.  And hang with the boys.  I know.  There's no, uh, yeah.  My mornings suck out there.  Put it that way.  Yeah.  I got to get my XM thing fixed because I got to listen to you guys.  That's why, you know, I was saying, you asked me to call in and stuff, but I always feel  like I'm going to disrupt, you know, how do I know somebody's... 
[02:44:30]  The flow?  Yeah, somebody's getting puked in their mouth.  Like, I don't want to be calling.  Hey, how you guys been?  Yeah, Bill, we're a little busy.  Oh.  So you want to be able to listen to see where we're at with the show before you call in.  Yeah, I was thinking maybe, like, towards the end of the show when you guys want to  get out of here.  Then I'll call in.  That's actually a very good time to call.  Yeah.  Hold us, yeah, and annoy the hell out of you guys.  Let's go.  I like your Desert Storm boots there, Anthony.  Yes, this is part of my 5'11 gear.  Remember, very easy. 
[02:45:00]  See, it's got a little Velcro thing here, and then the zipper comes down, and the whole  boot comes off.  Yeah.  So that way, at the airport, it's so easy to take your shoes off.  You know, when he flies once a year.  No, I fly a lot.  It's very easy.  Or a broken glass when you're chasing an intruder.  Yes, that too.  Quick zip.  Zip, Bill.  Have you noticed?  He's looking like a young Fidel Castro every day.  That's what I'm doing.  You really are.  I'm also wearing my 5'11 shirt. 
[02:45:30]  Look at this.  Very tactical.  Look at this.  Opens.  Holster in the shirt.  There's a holster built into the shirt.  Thing's wonderful.  Just bought a new gun, too.  A Colt Custom.  Dude, when are you going to take me shooting?  Nickel-plated .45.  I'm, like, into it now, by the way.  Shooting?  Yeah, I went to Houston, and the club owner took me out shooting.  It was the coolest.  I was scared to death.  Brought a .45.  Oh, nice.  I couldn't hit anything with it.  Like, literally, that stupid paper cutout was where that clock was.  And I'm literally shooting.  I'm seeing water spraying up, like, 200 yards beyond the target. 
[02:46:00]  But I'll tell you, for the beginner man, the 12-gauge.  Oh, yeah.  You can't miss with that thing.  That is a fun little weapon, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's great.  Kablam.  Yeah, I just bought a new .45.  Bought a new Colt Custom.  It's a...  What did you get, the 2008?  Yeah.  That's good.  I walked in there, and I just asked the guy.  I said, I want something shiny and loud.  That's what I'm down to with guns now.  Like, I got the ones I want that I've always wanted for their accuracy, shooting, how it feels in your hand. 
[02:46:30]  Now I just want ones that are like, yeah, this is like the one Vince Vega had in Pulp Fiction.  Could I have that one?  That's hilarious.  I just want, you know, shiny gun.  How many guns do you have to buy in there to get, like, the free Big Lebowski sniper shades?  Throw in those yellow-tinted things.  Yeah.  Get a punch card, like, your 10th gun is free.  How many handguns are you up to, Ant? 
[02:47:00]  I don't know.  Let me think.  Lost track?  Yeah, I have a lot.  I never like letting, you know, the enemy know how much I have.  Right.  You know, around the house.  He carries in his own house.  Did we tell you that last time?  What, are you going to have pajamas with a built-in holster?  Hell, everything I got has a built-in holster.  It's wonderful.  It wasn't good enough to have guns around the house that he could get to pretty quickly.  Now he actually carries within his own home. 
[02:47:30]  You know, it's not safe to just have loaded guns laying around the house.  It's true.  It's just not.  I'm a very safe gun owner.  So if I have it on me, there's the safety.  It's right there.  If an intruder perhaps comes in, I don't have to lunge for a drawer or hope, you know, to make it to the gun.  What did you do in your past that you're this paranoid?  You're a nice guy, Anthony.  I just, I don't know why.  But I think it's because I watch the news.  I see that the county I live in is home invasion capital of the country, apparently. 
[02:48:00]  So I'm not going to be the guy.  I'm not going to be that guy that gets the home invasion and sits there.  Because, you know, every single one of those bastards are sitting on the floor getting pummeled going, I wish I had a gun.  There isn't one of those guys that aren't wishing for a gun.  It's not like, I wish this gentleman had been more educated when he was growing up.  And perhaps I had two parents in the house and taught him values.  It's like, I wish I had a gun.  It gets very primal at that point. 
[02:48:30]  As much as we all think you're insane, that is a very good point.  It's just a valid point.  I know.  Perhaps I am a bit extreme.  I've come the other way.  Yeah.  I think everybody should have a gun.  I don't think it's good that only the government and the bad guys have guns.  It's not good.  Exactly.  That's what the Second Amendment's for.  Just, we, we, people should have guns.  I actually went fishing for the first time.  Like, I want to learn how to hunt and that stuff.  So I finally went.  Wow.  What's going on with you?  Because I've just read too much conspiracy theory.  I'm realizing, I want to have the option that if stuff goes down. 
[02:49:00]  Survival, my friend.  I can disappear into the mountains.  I'm going to go into Big Bear.  I like the way Billy's thinking now.  No, I just read, like, I don't know how to hunt.  I don't know how to fish.  I can't start a fire without a match.  I'm screwed.  Whatever they say.  We are putting microchips in the back of your head.  Okay.  I don't want to do that.  You want oatmeal?  Okay.  You're screwed.  I want to be like those rednecks.  You go into the woods.  You're in that two minutes.  You choke out a yak.  You got them on a spit.  You know what I mean? 
[02:49:30]  That's it.  You want to hunt your own food.  Yeah.  I want to know how to do it.  Like, if any point, if I'm in that avenge me moment.  Yeah.  Avenge me!  Yeah.  If I'm in that moment, I can somehow scale the fence and disappear and actually survive.  Get out.  I'm a big fan of the guys that fish right here in Manhattan.  In the river.  Oh, are you?  In the East River.  The East and the Hudson River, they are fishing for their supper in this city.  That's wonderful.  What are they catching in the Hudson River and the East River?  Squeeze those fish out and fill thermometers. 
[02:50:00]  That's a horrible place to fish.  That's a good sign of the economy.  People in Manhattan are fishing.  Fishing in the rivers.  I have noticed, because I take the bike path, that more people are fishing, so you might  be onto something, Bill.  Diddy's flying commercial.  Come on.  How bad are things?  Yeah, that's sad for Diddy.  He's grounded his jet.  Why?  Because he said fuel is too much.  So now he's got to fly first class.  Oh.  Yeah.  Poor Diddy.  Dude, I dug a little deeper in the conspiracy theory. 
[02:50:30]  On what?  I don't know.  I'm afraid to say it on air.  Wow, that big?  Yeah, I think I found.  I found, you know, four in the morning on YouTube.  I thought I got it all figured out.  Some Illuminati kind of stuff?  Yeah.  What do you got?  So cool.  I don't know.  I just read all this stuff on the Rothschilds family.  I like how they...  The candy manufacturers?  I know.  Exactly.  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  I don't want to talk about it.  I got like freaked out reading it.  Really?  I just freaked out reading it.  Yeah.  They kind of backed me.  No, you're going to have to let me in on some of this.  I love...  They made J.P. Morgan look like a punk.  They worked for him. 
[02:51:00]  Really?  I mean, he worked for them or something.  I was just like, oh my God.  Well, now you got to give us something, because you piqued everyone's interest there.  Well, the rest of it is on my website.  Well, they're an international banking family.  Is that true?  Well, on the outside.  What do you got on them, Bill?  Come on.  I don't know.  It's kind of like brand new.  I just...  I don't know.  I was just reading it.  It's just they kind of back...  What are they?  If there's a war, they kind of back both sides.  Oh.  And they're...  Yeah.  Profiteer?  Yeah.  And they're never on TV for some reason. 
[02:51:30]  Whenever they talk about the richest people on the planet, they're like, Bill Gates has  $4 million.  They got him on a jet ski.  You know?  And you're like, that son of a bitch.  He's got $4 million.  He's got...  Yeah.  One of them died and on that deathbed.  And they were like, how much money do you have?  And he's like, there's not enough zeros for me to even...  And he was just literally like, all the empires that have fell, Roman, all the way back  to the Mongolians, we have all that money.  Wow.  But the thing is, who did he say that to who was close enough to be on his deathbed? 
[02:52:00]  I have no idea.  Who would blab it and get it on YouTube?  Dude, but you know what's funny about...  Right before I learned that information, two seconds before that, I was watching somebody  get bit by a cobra.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I'm just...  I'm an idiot.  I don't know.  That's the beauty of the internet, though.  Come on.  No, there's a great video on there.  I think it's literally called Dumbass Gets Bit By Cobra.  So the...  How, like, intense it is, because you know he's going to get bit.  Yeah, yeah.  The anticipation.  But it's literally like the 11th strike before he gets hit.  So by the time he finally gets bit, like, my knees were up in my chest. 
[02:52:30]  Like, dude, what are you doing?  Dude.  Have you seen the piranhas ripping apart the mouse yet?  No.  That's a good one.  The little white mouse is swimming.  Swimming for his life in a tank.  He's doing strokes like Michael Phelps back and forth.  Oh, he's trying.  Oh, he's rocking the swim.  The piranha just start nibbling at him a little, and then they just start...  Oh, my God.  Just disemboweling the mouse in the water.  Yeah.  I saw one of these guys caught a cobra, and they put a rat in there.  And this rat did so well. 
[02:53:00]  Like, they should have let it live.  It was almost like, you know, survive three rounds with the champ.  Yeah.  You win some cigars.  This thing was literally...  Every time he would go to strike him, he would jump up and over.  You could see the snake was getting tired and getting annoyed.  And then the people put it in and started tapping the glass.  They tipped the tank off.  Oh, yeah.  It was totally...  Cheating.  Yeah, it was bogus.  Oh, that's not good.  You let the rat go at that point.  Hey, are you checking out the political process, Bill?  I can't believe it.  The convention?  We're watching, and we're just laughing our asses off, because there's just nothing but lies going on on TV. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, it's brutal.  Well, once I saw Hillary Clinton, I just realized, like, that's why I couldn't vote for her.  It just hurt the way she talks.  The next president of the United States.  We've been doing the ak-ak with her for many, many years.  A man who is qualified to be the president of the United...  Ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak.  She turns into Mars Attacks Alien.  and she's horrid she picked a good pantsuit though you got to give it to her the orange 
[02:54:00]  one was the right choice because there was a picture where they had a guy with five different  pantsuits to see which one would look good on set and she picked the good one the orange one  she pulls it up too high over her bun she looks like oliver hardy  she's in a buster keaton movie she should come out in that fast motion like walking  yeah hello little ragtime piano  yeah it's uh we were uh watching the convention last night and it's just like i've said just a 
[02:54:30]  bunch of liars they have you know biden and hillary just talking smack talking obama during the uh  the primaries when they were all hating each other oh yeah and and and jimmy brought up a good point  he goes don't these people realize this tape that they they taped them doing this oh yeah to play  it later biden is saying you know junkies yeah hey can i stay at your place they're like all right  and then you go to work and they sell your tv i'll deal with that later when he comes home 
[02:55:00]  so i got my smack now you know uh they all do that you don't you remember uh george bush senior  when he's running against reagan he's like voodoo economics voodoo economics yeah and then like two  months later he's like this guy's great yeah it's good i like that voodoo economics  yeah i meant voodoo in a good way it's all just crap in the end it really is just crap  yeah but it uh obama's uh definitely got some momentum with this uh with this little party that 
[02:55:30]  they throw but uh the republicans get the last ups they get to get their uh convention in when do  they go to their convention in a week when the hell is that stunt break oh next week next week uh  but kane's announcing his vice president uh tomorrow i think yes and uh who do you think  that's going to be stunt brain you did so well picking um obama's uh vice president saying you  could have been no way it's going to be joe biden you could have been more off we said old white guy  you went with a woman from the midwest yeah with katherine sebelius i was wrong on that one but 
[02:56:00]  there are three candidates we're down to mitt romney who would be the guy i would like to see in there  with him but tom ridge the former governor of pennsylvania who is would be key to combating the  uh fight that biden's going to give him in that uh critical state didn't ridge have a little  controversy over something he's always they all have a little controversy and he is pro-choice  so that's going to give oh to the uh pro-life well that might uh get in the way of the uh core  but they're saying that could help lunatic battleground states and there was uh talk of uh 
[02:56:30]  palenti this governor palenti who's a kind of a lukewarm guy but sounds too italian i uh no way i  think it's going to be ridge i go uh mitt romney then i'm going to be wrong i'm saying romney  why don't they just have a cape what they have a red farve yeah i don't think how these guys just  fight it out in a cage match or something a cage match make it fun what do you think of brett  farve on the jets there uh bill i know you're a huge uh pats fan but it's going to be uh one way 
[02:57:00]  or the other he's either going to have like the natural season or it's it's going to be  joe namath on the rams a lot of excitement here in new york yeah that's what we're a lot of  excitement here in new york but we think basically that he's going to have two okay years for the  jets and then he goes back to green bay as a hero and goes into the hall of fame as a packer  we've seen this play out so many times over the years with yeah because with other guys  great last season but the previous three were pretty rocky they weren't that great right yeah  he was uh throwing like what's up with brady he hasn't really uh practiced or anything 
[02:57:30]  he's still uh nursing that uh that ankle of his that they are trying to say isn't a problem dude  i can't even watch like i only watch the game so i don't watch any of the pregame just because  every sports show has turned into two guys screaming at each other you know what i mean and they always  have opposite opinions and it's always like so ridiculous i can't i can't i can't watch it it's just  become you know i don't know i don't think it's i think his ankle's a little slow swollen how could  you say that this is a guy he's got three rings he's got too much to lose they just start it's like 
[02:58:00]  really you can bring up water polo they're flipping out the chlorine balance was off in the pool  how do you play with the ph like that it's it and they get their i literally think they had pti came on  and those guys had a natural friendship and a natural organic arguing and then they were like  people like this they're watching this you go for just fight everybody yell everybody yell at each 
[02:58:30]  other so i can't oh yeah i can't watch it they don't agree that would be kind of fun though  i think uh i think the jets got it locked yeah me too good point next nothing gonna have to agree  with you on that one jimmy 28 more minutes commercial uh you uh you watched did you watch  the olympics oh yeah i was totally into it yeah right i thought you know what's hilarious was the  opening ceremony it was like the classic white guy statement they were like you know when they came 
[02:59:00]  out they were playing those drums and they were going nuts and everything and they were kind of  yelling it was it was awesome got you all amped up for the games and then uh i felt like i was at a  guitar concert but uh well they they literally were going like uh you know all the guitar fans out  there that's pretty good actually i kind of blew by that i don't even know what that's okay it's new  age he's the master of new age and uh all right anyway uh let me try to get the momentum going here  again someone out there's gonna go i got it oh yeah but he literally goes like uh you know because  they're sitting there slamming the drums and yelling and stuff and he literally goes uh you know an 
[02:59:30]  amazing uh performance here for the opening of the games and i gotta admit uh a little bit  intimidating i'm really like that is just the classic i'm in another country i'm used to being  around all white people and now these guys are getting excited the natives are getting restless  that's like that british you know with the safari hat yeah you know i really want to blame you for  that one because you kind of stopped the momentum in the beginning but i think that i'm sorry i'm  actually as even though you're kidding i'm actually like thinking like i'm actually thinking about  your point and it's actually not a bad point it's like every time you see video of non-whites with 
[03:00:00]  drums the guy's being cooked alive so exactly yeah it's the uh shaka zulu moment i do shaka  zulu i have to explain something else there is a distraction going on i blew it with the guitar  absolutely i'll take full credit but also the phones are ridiculous they're all lit going nuts  and the instant feedback is is flying by at this point you can't even read them because uh xm went  down so people are freaking the f out yeah apparently uh so that's what i saw so as i was trying to 
[03:00:30]  listen to you then i'm seeing what the hell's going on you know are we still on the air anywhere  but i guess we are on the regular radio but not on the satellite so i do apologize to you that's  all right you want to take a quick break we'll regroup and we'll continue hey this is jbl john  bradshaw layfield from the wwe you're listening to the worst of opie and anthony welcome back to uh  the opie and anthony radio program i'm jim norton and opie's chewing and anthony's looking at a naked 18  year old here's the great bill burr in studio oh i'm in town from california i'm gonna see what

[03:06:30]  the father the mother keeps their child sick to get attention for themselves so they're always they  have they build up a relationship with the doctors the nurses they love the sympathy that they get so  they keep their child sick by giving them either poison in their food but i thought they kill them  don't they uh that happens eventually you know a kid can only be that sick so long before they die

[03:11:30]  gentlemen callers for these two they're always out together so they'll need two gentlemen to take  them out not understanding they don't want guys they just didn't want to acknowledge it back there  and there was the old gay couple the guys it's like hey ladies these men aren't taken they're like  frolicking in a pool with a beach ball gus and elmo gus and elmo elmer elmer that was the name 
[03:12:00]  gus and elmer yeah yes they're fresh back from the war and looking for action are they you know it's  funny back then every guy who was in shape like they had no muscles they just had that i'm in  seventh grade torso you notice that like being in shape back in the day just meant you weren't fat  right because you could be barrel like barrel like or something yeah if you watch like ben her and all  of them yeah they have just these straight arms there's no tricep abide it's like skin hanging on 
[03:12:30]  the bone but they're not they're not fat they all weigh like 140 pounds yeah they just you just thrust  your chest out it was like yeah watching like uh tony curtis and spoticus yeah it's like i'm a  gladiator my name's spoticus and and he just he looked like crap and then nowadays you turn on  the 300 and go jesus christ how do you get a body like that it's a whole group of guys that had  nothing but abs so ben's ben stiller is shredded in comedy yeah what the hell is that he jumps in  the pool he's got an eight pack i'm like really ben stiller comedy he was shredded i'm like oh my god 
[03:13:00]  i gotta go to the gym trauma judah ben her with a big barrel chest and a gut i'm in great shape  are you chuck yeah as long as your chest was out further than yeah and they'd suck their gut in  when they take their shirt off they'd suck it in and it would just look horrible weissmiller the  guy who played tarzan tarzan yeah his little leaf shorts pulled up beyond his navel remember that  and he would be sucking it in the first guy who played batman remember him yeah utility belt 
[03:13:30]  cranked oh yeah adam west yeah and the uh stretchy material was all stretched you can see how doughy  his stomach was yeah really have come uh leaps and bounds from those days yeah no no core strength  now it doesn't matter what you're doing everybody's gonna be shredded in the movies and tv you should  see the way like people work out in la i'm telling you like if you want like the next big money  making thing get into like hip replacements and knee replacements really they're doing that that  muscle confusion you confuse it man it doesn't have what it doesn't have well basically if they say if 
[03:14:00]  you do the same workout after a couple two three weeks your body gets used to it and it becomes part  and you stop getting results so what you do is you confuse it is you just perpetually have it so i  don't know just constantly doing these different exercises i was only on the treadmill i'm doing all  the old school stuff i felt like i should have been wearing like the uh the gray pullover sweatshirt you  know like jack la lane doing calisthenics yeah and this dude is literally this is i swear to god  this is what he's doing he would jump up grab the chin up bar he'd do a pull up then he'd come down 
[03:14:30]  he does one jumping jack drops down into the squat and then goes into like a push-up and like spread  his legs jumped up and then then brought him back together oh his muscles didn't know what was going  on did a push-up and then went back and he did like a set of 30 of those and i'm like shoulders  knee oh that's good and the whole time he's jumping up and landing back down the best thing  too is he was completely out of shape oh so he just probably watched like that p90x video have

[03:15:30]  like if you jog every day you still lose weight of course you do people that go out and jog every  day what do you what do you jog sideways and then jog on your hands run yeah that's all you need to do  i i know if you're eating like a pig if you're working out and eating right it doesn't matter if  your muscles are dazed and confused you'll be fine you'll work there's no money in that no no you  gotta have some trainer that's gonna tell you you gotta you gotta mix up the muscle first of all  don't let your muscles hear this yeah we're gonna confuse them what after the workout you have a

[03:23:00]  everybody a man from moline is now charged with holding five people hostage in fort madison iowa he was  caught when he sent two of his alleged victims on a beer run police say it started when 33 year old  jason slaggle pulled a knife during an argument  what a dope this guy is huh 33 year old jason slaggle pulled a knife during an argument with  another man on tuesday night told the other people in the room that they were not allowed to leave  eventually slaggle got thirsty sent two of those hostages for beer who then called police and they 
[03:23:30]  came to the rescue did he really hold five people hostage with a knife that's pretty stupid i'm not  a tough guy but if there's five of us and you have a knife you're in trouble we're gonna give it a shot  right yeah yeah and i'm not the guy who has like the knife on me right right right yeah that's when  you give him the lawrence taylor blindside to the back cause him to fumble what a bad hostage taker  go get me some beer and you better come back or i'll what cut one of us shut up 
[03:24:00]  it's good to know we have xm listeners that we can't go to the phones because they're all calling  to say we're not on the air right is that what they're all calling about can we get the word out  through the pad data like they know stop calling they're working on it because i brought up the  rothschilds do you know what's that i brought them cut to all communications i tried to tell you  i only wanted to talk to you during break they're behind the merger man i'm telling you  all right we're gonna break illuminati stuff yeah that's scary that's all i think about now is the 
[03:24:30]  illuminati just think that they're running things and and this is all a facade everything else the  government everything's a big facade just to keep everybody it's like the matrix yeah yeah we're  all looking at pictures of britney spears vagina yeah we have no idea of anything else nothing else  we're captivated by that they throw distractions at us at perfect times oh yeah yeah first i came in 
[03:25:00]  here did you see the new met stadium yeah see hey rothschild but didn't wouldn't would they allow  the internet to actually now they're starting to be revealed all this talk the books about the  illuminati would they allow all this if they were so good no they're shutting it down on two two  on 2012 they're coming out with like the internet too and it's basically going to be like glorified  basic cable you're gonna have to seriously you're gonna have to pay for extra uh extra i don't know  websites they'll be like how is that gonna work is this chapter yeah it's being talked about yeah 
[03:25:30]  oh it isn't being talked about it's actually a law it's gonna be happening think that's how the  hell can that happen yeah they put you if you get a new passport there's a little microchip in it  now yeah they're gonna basically they're starting with dogs they're putting in dogs  yeah and they're gonna be like so unattractive women have a passport yeah exactly microchip  no they put they're gonna start with the dogs you know what if fido gets lost they'll have a couple  those stories on tv and then they were able to find him and the dog was okay and everybody excited  then let's start a panic about your kids getting abducted so they give them some sort of wristband to 
[03:26:00]  wear and then eventually they'll they'll slowly it's already there's a commercial it's already in  their shoes you see the commercial on television yeah you can put the mother is in a park and she  starts to panic and she's like saying her kid's name kevin kevin or something and she pulls this  thing out of her purse that's going beep beep like in aliens when they're looking for the aliens and  it's beeping and she sees a little dot and she follows it and there's her son uh because he's got some  kind of chip on him she can find it and then it was for duracell batteries because you know she 
[03:26:30]  only depends on duracell yeah they find her kids slowly gradually getting it's like cloning they're  not just gonna clone a guy hey we got another dick cheney this one's got a good heart huh it's gonna  freak everybody out they start small they start with like a goat or a squirrel oh it's adorable and  they'll gradually work their way up so like eventually probably by the end of my lifetime it'll be  mandatory every baby that is owned right between their eyes they're gonna have this big chip  and all your information is going to be on it and that way then they got you if you mess with the 
[03:27:00]  deal they just they just turn your chip off wow you hear about andy they turned his chip off turned  his chip off then you're out in the street your bathrobe with all your pistols chipless  and that's why you're fishing and learning how to hunt that's how i'm doing it yeah they're not  gonna get you not getting me i caught a striped bass i know what i'm doing what's this charge  for internet thing that bugs me i won't like that at all who's gonna do it well the thing you know 
[03:27:30]  i love about all this stuff is no we don't get to vote on any of it we don't get to yeah any of it  all they just come up with these laws oh yeah by the way who's complaining about the internet right  now i'm not i love it no it's great i like having everything available well you can kiss that goodbye  in a couple years sir they can't tax it they're not making any money off it they'll lose these these  scumbags they're losing money on the phone bill or all these other ways that people are  communicating because the emails are losing postage because people are not just mailing  letters anymore no but no the big thing is you lose control of people like you have to be able 
[03:28:00]  to control the information that they see that way the lie matches up with the information and you're  able to continue on but if people can kind of bounce around then you get all these other guys like info  war guys like them saying all that stuff like hey here's another side of the argument so what they  dig you know they'll gradually funnel it in too much information is being made available to people  which informs them and an informed people is dangerous to any government some old white guy  sitting in a castle right now there's too much information i think let out over there we must 
[03:28:30]  crush it grandfather rothschild just swimming in gold i think what do you do with all that money i think  they just roll around like those coins putting it under their armpits oh it's cold yeah he's actually  sir theodore rothschild people are talking about us let's lock up the internet theodore  i think we got to step aside for a few minutes hey this is sean williams scott you're listening

[03:44:30]  there's a knife in his teeth if i can survive that i can survive the presidency i think he should just  come out of a mud wall behind like everyone thinks he's not there he opens his eyes they're like what  is that and it's john mccain walking out of a mud wall i didn't even see him  but they're saying it's the white house yeah what you look at this it's a little presumptuous  oh they're trying to make it look like the white house are they like a room yeah it looks like  a greek ruins it looks like he's trying to this is the common man he's coming out of of of the 
[03:45:00]  parthenon i mean stop it is there anything funnier than watching all those politicians  calling each other privileged and this person is that he's an elitist yeah like really hillary  bilderberg group that isn't a little elitist elitist yeah she's like one of the biggest elitists  uh on the face of the earth who's ever seen hillary on a flight on a commercial flight to la  she ever been sitting in front class no hey there she was walking through the airport toting her bag 
[03:45:30]  behind her yeah rolling her luggage stop like the working man right the working i like that how uh  yeah when uh barack announced biden as his vice president um how they came out on stage with their  uh jackets off and their sleeves were rolled up like they're ready to get to work to go to work  are you go yeah what kind of dirty work are they doing all right let's dig some trenches we're gonna do  some plumbing today there's no work that they're doing that they need to uh roll their shirt sleeves 
[03:46:00]  up except for taking all the art off the walls of the white house and hanging up the posters from good  times a bunch of this is gonna be jj art on the walls those weird paintings that jj did oh i love  those ones the guy dunking the ball in his arms like three miles yeah good stuff i just picked yeah  if barack gets in there i just picture a different kind of white house like i've done a lot of uh  jobs uh when i was uh uh uh robbing houses known a lot of jobs when i was doing air conditioning work 
[03:46:30]  i was in a lot of people's houses and uh a lot of different races and i've noticed different things  that are in common and a lot of african american families have african art in the house that's what i've  noticed and i could just see a lot of african art on the walls of the white house probably for the  first time not probably definitely for the first time ever taking down some of the old paintings of 
[03:47:00]  maybe taft one of those war masks put up a war yeah a lot of masks things like that bill he's very  scared of the possibility of barack being the president i'm not scared yeah you're scared there's  a whole nother wall of white people behind that that's just that's just a front yeah that's yeah  the president that's just the illuminati's caroline in the city that's like this sitcom they just write  the whole thing they rehearse they rehearse they do their blocking on thursday and on friday they go 
[03:47:30]  out and they give the speech do a table read and then they we need rewrites that's your one-man show  man that's great bill burr i'm paranoid i would love that it's good that's very funny man i've uh  what scares me uh the most is his vulnerability and what anything that happens to him might cause  because god forbid something does happen like has happened to presidents in the past that were um for 
[03:48:00]  a lot of change very different uh rocking the boat kind of a thing that doesn't usually bode well for  a president because there are people out there with uh suddenly trying to goad somebody into  doing something would i ever do that i'm just commenting on the fact that there are some  psychopaths out there question what radical thing are any of them none of them are talking about  getting out of iraq none of them talk but they're just doing the usual we're gonna get health care  well let me tell you something everybody's gonna have donuts middle of the country uh really doesn't  need much more of a reason than skin color to uh think that that's radical middle of the country 
[03:48:30]  upstate new york well that's what i mean you get out of that too yeah the second you leave a city  very easy to scare the hell out of well we don't have to take care of this here but uh because of  that uh and looking at what happens when uh police uh beat uh black man or uh something happens he dies  in custody and uh could you imagine something like that happening to the president of the united  states the first black president he'll be fine i think there will be uh unrest i say unrest is how 
[03:49:00]  i put it this is what you're hoping for why would i hope for that because you're uh you have issues  i don't have issues you do have issues you have a gun collection you don't have issues i oh i just  bought another one the other day it's still uh at the store what is it it's a sig uh 223 oh i thought  you were gonna tell the same story you did uh a while ago oh no no it's brand remember that you  you already said you uh bought a new i bought a colt yeah you got another no now i bought another 
[03:49:30]  rifle rifle it's uh yeah what video game uh was this one from this one wasn't from one i was in  the gun store and i looked at it and was just like oh wow hell boy i gotta take that no i gotta get  that he buys his guns cigs are great according to the video games he's playing i have done that where  i played a video game and one of the guns are really cool so i go to the gun store and buy a real  one do you have a scarface grenade launcher one no i have one that kind of looks like it uh but a  grenade launchers are frowned upon by um you know the law enforcement yeah law enforcement 
[03:50:00]  i'm hunting with a grenade launcher hey why can't i hunt with a grenade launcher so what going was this  again it's it's uh sig uh 223 yeah it looks a lot like that that's uh that's the one it's got the  same optic it's um yeah that's the guy that's the that's right into your house the cali cartel  that is an attractive weapon i'll tell you that do you have like a desk and like a big leather  chair with like your initials in the back of it ah let me tell you i just uh i had my desk delivered 
[03:50:30]  and it matches uh the rest of the woodwork and it's giant it's wood and it's got leather on the  top when do the two big ivory tusks yes i need ivory tusks and then i want in bones my initials above  my head what are you going to do with this what am i going to do with that gun take to the range  and blast rounds off into targets but they look like various things things going to get old and  boring you know that you think then what are you going to do with this you got to go to the range 
[03:51:00]  what's the option he's going to hunt the ultimate prey the ultimate prey i am uh stocking up yes i am  i am stockpiling because i do believe our second amendment rights are going to be infringed upon  further when the democrats get into office and you will see gun laws these stupid assault weapon  bans and things like this that are semantics are going to be put in place there's going to be more  limitations put on people's right to uh get pistols and i will not stand for it so great how they're 
[03:51:30]  chopping down that tree republicans do the left side the other guys do the right they just chop down  we can listen to your phone calls yeah put you know microchips in your passport i don't care about  that as much because i'm not saying anything on the phone god i'm not saying anything bad what am  i saying on the phone hi bob how are things going and then i fall asleep the people that are tapping  the phones are falling asleep on my agent calls for that didn't you if you're not doing anything 
[03:52:00]  what's the problem okay what is the problem dude they uh first of all i could take a month's worth of  your phone calls and i could splice it and edit together holy jesus and you could never run for  office unless you said what i wanted you to think i could be running for office anyway based on my past  on this show but if you ever he what in a what if you ever if you ever had like he was how old  i never know you know what it is they're literally doing smells like bubblegum and homework 
[03:52:30]  i don't know they're literally doing stuff when i was a kid when they used to talk how bad russia was  they can listen to your phone calls and all like yeah 30 years later that now they're doing it and now  the patriot act it's just being used to fight terrorism exactly exactly that's exactly what it is  it's it's it's to protect us yes yes it's protecting absolutely that's exactly what and  then occasionally they use it for drug dealers yeah i don't want it being used for drug dealers and 
[03:53:00]  then sometimes they use it for other crimes occasionally they'll they'll buy a new shiny  black van and just people disappear that's like the next the next level of it i want everything  commerce scanners yeah yeah i just got the keys they're talking too much on that radio show  oh you're done you're done i am i'm finished rothschild family's got a black van out front  waiting for you we're gonna just hear bill go i'm not organized and it's like where did bill go if  they haven't picked up michael moore yet i got nothing to worry about they can't he's one of them 
[03:53:30]  he's being chased by a forklift he just ducks into a corner chasing him a harpoon somewhere  unfortunately we got to get the hell out of here yeah  this is bill burr you are listening to the worst of opie and anthony  opie and anthony you're listening to the worst worst hey this is richard jeffis and you're  listening to the worst opie and anthony this is the fucking worst of opie and anthony  that's pretty stupid we uh every once in a while do the top uh country songs in america but we're

[04:11:00]  have cried you don't know how to cry though if i could have cried at a song it would have been  when i heard this that's how great this song is  all right uh because calvin klein no friend of mine don't want nobody's name on my behind  well that's a white yeah sneakers on my feet jay by my side yeah without the calvin klein that's a white 
[04:11:30]  thing that's white world really because calvin klein was big with black people back then  calvin's was huge with blacks jordash calvin's absolutely okay sergio valente i don't even  know you remember those bands so what the fuck are they gonna wear then if they don't have the  calvin's levi's because you really can't there's no name on levi's even though it is a name it's  levi it's levi but calvin klein is like you associate that with a dude and levi was like a redneck  why would you wear his jeans who the fuck knows i mean you can make hypocrites out of anybody but 
[04:12:00]  i know what they i get it i think levi was way more racist i mean you can i don't know  calvin i think calvin klein was a sissy too i think we do a little wikipedia on levi jeans you're  gonna find some scary stuff  why i think levi's short for levington all right hold on we got louis the great louis ck oh oh sorry i  said the great patrice o'neill earlier i saw louis uh new hour at carolines over the weekend

[04:13:00]  and everything yeah i just really like it it's uh uh it's it's in the pop category i i don't mind  a good pop song every once in a while no that's that's what the last one i liked this way was uh  believe by share that's the last song that i like oh jeez you heard that's a little that's a little  gayish oh well totally it's so little wayne's song i mean it's all gay i i don't think hardcore  black guys are like you know cranking up uh this lollipop song right patrice is more like a girly song 
[04:13:30]  i'm thinking i don't know but it's a pimp song it's that pimp it's that it's that thing where black  guys that are pimps and they get furry and they start getting peacock-ish and then they become women  yeah yeah well i got something for you low yeah  do you believe in oh yeah  louis said oh he's gonna call  he's whacking his bag right now 
[04:14:00]  you gotta listen to this when you're running you gotta go running with this on your uh on your  on your ipod to believe all right away from gay people are you running from well the one i mean  if lou's gonna admit i'll admit the the one that gets me is a madonna song which one ray of light  oh yeah i like that i like running all right oh ray of light ray of light makes you run a little  little faster a little harder if you're working out yes yes no in little pink shorts definitely 
[04:14:30]  yeah you dick no i'm saying it's awesome with the pink shorts i'm not making funny you like pink  shorts well when i'm running to listen how could you not like this as far as pop songs go uh not  everything has to be a guitar riff no it doesn't okay i mean i i don't i don't search out madonna  songs but if you're exposed to a song like this you know i'm like yeah she is cool wait she's singing  now well let her start let her get into it a little bit oh yeah you're just warming up on the treadmill 
[04:15:00]  right now give madonna a second yeah give her time man she's we're revving up man we're going to  a higher level here i don't think so yes i think this is a a girl's song wait when she screams and i  feel you know what the you know what this looks like when she does it live  it's if if she's doing this live yeah you are just seeing gay men jumping around to this 
[04:15:30]  with you know what also with magical blinking lights with a lot of extra horse shit right  that's what he's got the backpacks on and stuff yeah because the rhymes i say sharp as a nail  whitties can be enough for sale all right and that's all you got to do is see two niggas with adidas 
[04:16:00]  and i still want to be run dmc if i could be i would this hat is a dedication to them man it  certainly is like isn't there motherfuckers you love like that you don't love this bitch  i don't know hold on here it comes again come on 
[04:16:30]  he knows  the point of that music is it's all produced music and if you listen to those three songs  by the way lollipop that one yeah and believe they're probably the same producer hey totally  gay yeah you like that don't you faggot well now i'm not with you i can i can squeeze one of these  songs on my ipod not all three because i wish i knew how to quit you i might be able to squeeze  this in between some cool like white boy rock music but not all three man oh no but i mean 
[04:17:00]  they're all the same it's basically whatever whoever that producer works for gets the hit  whoever gets you know it doesn't matter i mean this is all shitty music but i really makes my  body feel good because i think my body you really like lollipop uh louis lollipop i can crank it all  the time so that's fair because i think i like some shitty songs probably but but anthony's not  innocent here come on ant what you listen to some weird stuff too man uh weird not fruity like that  like gunfire and give us one when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie i'm not really a dean martin 
[04:17:30]  fan hold on here we go again lou oh yeah oh yeah yeah just got fucked in the ass as you  white people back when they lived in outer space i love i love blue in the background awesome  i love madonna hey luke listen any group what what group do you love like you go i love these 
[04:18:00]  motherfuckers as just i love them i have all i like i let zeppelin like you love now number one you love  i love run dmc and then there's some other ones i love but if you go you you get a choice to keep keep  a music group alive number one for me is zeppelin you to keep zeppelin oh my god is huge number one  the beatles are huge for me led zeppelin's huge i love the beatles myself but number one you get you 
[04:18:30]  go this this survives zeppelin timeless i had started that's really timeless it's definitely overplayed  not just not that easy no the songs they play on the radio overplayed so overplayed  that one has a whole catalog that could hit the radio airwaves tomorrow and do extremely well  and also it depends on like i just uh i just got this uh marvin gaye cd and i can't stop listening  to that which one what song low uh what's going on the whole album it's one song fades into the 
[04:19:00]  next and it's phenomenally good hippie it's better than anything right now that the marvin gaye would  really argue that one man marvin gaye was competes competes with led zeppelin probably  oh yeah definitely anything any best black art artistic anything probably beats any artistic  white anything really yeah i'll tell you a very bold statement it certainly is hey i want to uh  thank billy boston uh yes i'll tell you a rap song that i couldn't get enough of 99 problems but the 
[04:19:30]  bitch ain't one of course because it's just but that shit was out it was wrong with that nothing  wrong with it it's nothing wrong with you like but you liked it i'm not gonna search out black songs  in general black people love that song like that that's what i i like i'm into that song but you're  into it for just because white people are fascinated with pimp pimping no dude it's and fascinated with  that shit it's the beat of this song and that bass line is amazing but rock boxes rock box dryer sheet in 
[04:20:00]  my shirt oh you better you better can i just say one thing about lollipop yeah you guys were trying  to figure out i mean the wrapper thing is really simple it's just the letter lick the wrapper like  if you've got a lollipop it's got a wrapper on it all right so he's talking about a condom no he's  saying that he's saying the the in the double entendre the first entendre is the wrapper that  you put on a lollipop right she wants to lick the wrapper like it's like she's he's giving her scraps 
[04:20:30]  and then the other side of it is rapper with an starting with an r yeah if he is a rapper that  makes sense she's like fooling around with the rapper a little bit could be the pants could be the fly  like the rapper or he's just a stupid black guy who's making up stupid words that's a very bold  statement there's bluey you can say that he's mexican no i've been saying he's stupid and he 
[04:21:00]  happens to also be black i like there's an apology coming do you have black friends louie  i'm sorry i said that yeah hey uh hello did you hear the shack freestyle thing the what  shack freestyling about kobe what did shack say about kobe oh she got the uncensored version we  got to play it it's quick so stay on the line and uh all right we had a lot of fun with this this  morning figuring out uh shack came up with the best riff ever it's gonna be all over the radio 
[04:21:30]  in the next couple of weeks someone's gonna do something with this here it is it ain't about that  it's about big a.k.a big shack now that's the difference between first and last break kobe  tell me how my ass tastes okay kobe tell me how my ass tastes  okay everybody kobe tell me how my ass tastes  kobe you can't do it without me kobe you can't do it without me 
[04:22:00]  everybody kobe tell me how my ass tastes yeah you can't do it without me yeah you can't do it 
[04:22:30]  without me yeah you can't do it without me everybody kobe  yeah he got the crowd going what do you think kobe how do my how do my ass taste yeah he's saying how's my  ass taste yeah and we're trying to figure out what that means and i think we finally got it  well he's saying first he's saying tell me how my ass tastes yeah right yeah which i think is like to  me poetry is something that brings an image to your mind very vividly yeah and so i immediately see 
[04:23:00]  giant shack with his shorts down to his ankles and kobe just fucking munching his  his asshole and then shack looking back and going tell me which is a really funny impulse  while somebody's eating your ass look back and go tell me how my ass tastes  that really is like an inappropriate thing to say as that's going on yeah like looking back  and they go hey tell me how my ass tastes like it's the ultimate narcissism that you want someone 
[04:23:30]  to eat your ass you know i want to know how that tastes and kobe then's got to like pull his head  back and just going oh no it's good it's good you gotta look around the corner of his ass yeah  yeah and then get back to it i i went with this uh you know he's basically saying he's a better  basketball player than kobe so shack is dunking the ball and kobe's helpless and now his ass is at uh  mouth level as kobe watches the dunk go down i think that's probably what that means uh yeah 
[04:24:00]  ah but patrice came up with it it has something to do well it was the guy malik he he he invade  he from asbury park yes he what he what he was saying louis was he fucked kobe's wife  and when kobe kisses his wife he's saying he tastes shack's ass tell me how my ass tastes  because kobe's wife ate shack's ass according to malik from asbury park  that gives me another great uh visual which is not the woman like i don't see shack laying on his 
[04:24:30]  stomach with the woman eating his asshole yeah i see him just sitting on a woman's head  uh with his naked and so you just see her from the neck down just coming out of his ass  until she's until she's unconscious then kobe comes yeah and he kisses her and he tastes his ass  yeah well we think that's going to be a huge hit they're going to take that shack riff and make  something into it make something i want to know how his ass tastes oh now you gotta wonder 
[04:25:00]  i bet it's not very tasty i don't think i want to know how my ass tastes now  because that's the impulse there is like you can't taste your own ass like i could actually  find out what shack's ass tastes like well we do taste your people's ass because you keep shitting in  the spinach and the tomatoes so tell you people to stop shitting in our food so we won't know what  yeah hey tell me how my ass tastes our shit doesn't taste like our ass 
[04:25:30]  tell me how my shit tastes i will when i get out the hospital for salmonella you motherfuckers  oh fuck man damn so still better than you you're fucking  here we go here we go  it's getting a little too real now man  oh it all just comes out man that was like like the untouchables still better than you you 
[04:26:00]  stuck irish  just a lot of brown people fighting for the scraps that's all we are you know what made me laugh all  day yesterday was uh our discussion on the special place how girls will say they're saving  oh they're saving their ass for marriage i heard that that's amazing it's like that the  but then when you really break it down you're like what the  fuck is special about that that's what they should be giving up before marriage and the 
[04:26:30]  first thing should be that fucking stinky god damn sewer yeah women should be giving up the stink hole  right the the hole where miracles happen where where two cells divide and life begins yeah that's that  to her that's like a fucking taco bell drive-thru yeah right through there but but the place where  there's shit and fucking diarrhea and uh fucking eight year old eight day old guys come that slithered 
[04:27:00]  back out that that's fucking that she's saving that that's got a little blue ribbon on it that's  the magic fucking prize yeah that's where that's wrap it up where the guys really want to be right  there yeah that's where she's got a little blue ribbon and a poem written in in script you know by  and all that calligraphy i'm saving my shithole for my husband yeah  we finally broke it down yesterday we finally broke it down yesterday we're like what the  fuck yeah what are you talking about this this stupid special place ain't the prize 
[04:27:30]  about it this hole that has shot out like gobs of diarrhea after a bad meal  i'm saving that for the man that i love who i haven't yet met who i'm going to love yeah yeah  oh i don't get it oh my god that pristine place  fucking stupid cunt that woman was i hated her  i was driving around yelling at my fucking radio when she was on i hated her which one  the woman who you're talking to at that moment that called in the fucking drunk all the drunk 
[04:28:00]  yeah i hated her fucking annoying it looked like she had a little coke habit and i can't believe how  patient you guys are with uh people like that i just wanted to fucking find her  her i want you to keep her on the phone so we could get a trace on her and i could go to her  house and beat her to death yeah we're trying to get into our head a little bit like what the  fuck yeah didn't pan out no that one didn't pan out you know that may be the the one kind of  person in the world where there would be no benefit finding out what she what what makes her tick 
[04:28:30]  yeah good point good point you know yeah you know like whatever like hitler or the terrorists we  really it'd be really good to know what those people are like so we can well but but she there's  nothing to get we're learning about hitler today we're finding out he had a sense of humor that he's  a funny guy that hitler was a funny guy we got uh two big comedians uh one on the phone and one  in studio what he used to joke being a funny guy he used to make jokes about uh all of his uh 
[04:29:00]  how does his subordinates yeah he was like uh bush like how he had nicknames for his uh people  and stuff yeah yeah no hitler uh hitler what i heard is that hitler uh when he saw a chaplain  he loved charlie chaplin and when charlie chaplin made the great dictator it broke hitler's heart  like it really hurt his feelings oh poor hitler i know like you didn't have poor hitler at first  he was like look at this motherfucker with my mustache yeah thank you for that wait i think  he's making fun of me this motherfucker poor hitler yeah adolf hitler took time out from 
[04:29:30]  running nazi germany to make jokes at the expense of his henchmen a new book claimed his favorite  victim was luftwaffe chief luftwaffe i know the chief heinrich heinrich himmler uh herman that was uh  herman goering right who was notoriously fond of awarding himself medals and decorations according to the  book by the last surviving member of his bunker hitler accounted how miss gang found her husband 
[04:30:00]  waving a baton over his underwear in the bedroom and asked him what he was doing he replied on  promoting my underpants to overpants how that hitler hitler then joked hitler's hysterical underpants  he's promoting him to overpants i sound like he wrote for hogan's hero hitler said to be so proud  of his joke that he made medals made from gold and silver paper for getting to wear on his pajamas 
[04:30:30]  i wonder where the gold and silver came from how did a motherfucker that tried to kill an entire race  have a sense of humor ever he's a funny guy let's just listen to that joke what's not funny about  killing all the jews it's oh my god jesus louis i mean what's not funny about how the  do you do that another on another occasion he noticed his official photographer hen henrich  hoffman had drunk too much and told him don't stand too near the fire heine you might burst into flames 
[04:31:00]  because he drank so much and you know that he got huge laughs for those jokes oh my god who was not  laughing at hitler's shit and then after the heckles hitler the the laugh died down you know  everybody ha ha and he go okay go go put some more people in a gas chamber oh yeah like you  motherfucker like what's wrong with you it was a break in the action a couple jokes all right but  now we gotta get back to work back to business the book is called the last witness it's gonna be  published in britain uh later this year oh who's not who's not making jokes who everybody laughs at 
[04:31:30]  everything you say i mean that's just too tempting to have an audience that oh yeah he makes a joke  nobody goes ah not not that funny buddy yeah no no one does no there's two kinds of people that  get laughs whatever they say there's dictators and astronauts always get laughs yeah true when  you're in space and you make the slightest joke like you go hey uh i can see yankee stadium somebody 
[04:32:00]  get me a hot dog and the whole controller just dies laughing yeah because they could die at any moment  yeah try making that joke it's the fucking water cooler hey somebody give me a hot dog yeah they'll  punch in the face shut up yeah don't fucking get a hot dog downstairs you faggot and they throw them  out the window yeah i know we're all over the place but uh something else we were going to bring up  here in new york chase stadium is closing down so i guess is it the last what uh subway series yes the 
[04:32:30]  last subway series can we get that commercial still you think they they had dramatic music basically  encouraging people to to come out to shea stadium before they knock that shithole down excuse me like  there's something important there that's the cw 11 that is running that uh fucking promotion and uh  i do believe i will be joining uh jill at an event where we will be uh uh celebrating the um  the closing of that game yeah yeah it's called shea stadium uh well the last game of the uh subway series 
[04:33:00]  kind of thing yeah it's the last subway series before the first one of next season it's a  different stadium yeah exactly thank you we see k setting us right it's like yeah i mean this is  hardcore met fans that listen to us no one is sitting there crying because shea stadium's being uh  torn down come and help us uh celebrate the last june 24th right 2008 ever no one would be accurate if  they went on and said look uh you got your last uh chance to take a shit in the stands at shea stadium 
[04:33:30]  before they knock this shit hole down yeah place stinks it always sucked  always slow what's it going to be called now it's going to be called uh much better than shea stadium  washington mutual bank of america bank of some shit what is it they painted blue and orange  it's going to be called city field it's going to be called thank god we got rid of that shithole

[04:34:30]  smile like look at everyone laughing just about everybody listening to us would say that as like  obviously this is really hacky and awful not kenny he was so proud hitler wouldn't have gotten a laugh  with that one no yeah there you go and uh by the way shaq lost his deputy badge for doing that uh  freestyle rap about uh kobe and i think the reason was because he used the n-word yeah the  black guy using the n-word and they're taking his badge away from him look at this  fucking asshole talking about shaq yeah are we gonna get the commercial before 
[04:35:00]  fucking dumb all right louie hang on for a second because you got to hear how dramatic they're making  this last subway series here in new york all right where are you off to by the way what's that  you're in a car right i'm in a car in upstate new york yeah oh nice very nice that's not nice  where are you playing nice here no i just dropped my kids off at their day summer camp  oh see louie's uh is a good dad day summer camp he's a very dedicated dad so you got to drive

[04:36:00]  audience uh officially you've been kind of hinting at this whole uh separation divorce thing yeah i  don't know i still don't know how to tell the audience when i do shows i don't know how to tell  them it's like harder than telling my children one it's a big part of his uh new hours talking  about you know the separation and being a dad and stuff and uh at caroline's i could tell you  were a little awkward because all of a sudden you're just like uh i'm separated you know you just threw  it out there which i thought was kind of cool start talking about your desire as a uh 54 year old man 
[04:36:30]  to now you know get some new new twat oh believe me that was the first thing  that was my first thing on my mind is uh i want many different vaginas to be enveloping my penis  there you go man hey hey was you getting a pussy in your prime that you were supposed to be getting  or is this going to be some new oh no this is i'm getting right now this is the best no i was  this pussy that's is this pussy that's old to you like because i didn't get my pussy the old in my in 
[04:37:00]  my prime pussy years i didn't get a lot of pussy the pussy i was supposed to like in from between high  school and college so i didn't i never got a lot i mean i got some really really skanky road  pussy when i was because i started doing stand-up when i was 17. oh lucky louie jack oh you're gonna  get some wait a minute you're gonna get some lucky louie pussy exactly i'm finally getting lucky louie  how do you get some lucky louie pussy nigga i'm getting lucky louie i'm getting lucky louie  canceled pussy anthony and i which is a little not as good as lucky louie on the air pussy but i

[04:38:00]  and we were the faithful dicks we actually we actually turned down going  fucking skinny dipping with 20 year olds with that were the kalua they were the kalua girls that would  go around the bar with the kalua and wearing the like kalua fucking skirts and things and they  wanted to go out and yeah just go fucking get naked with us and shit and anthony i  both gotta go home we we had cartoon voices no no no i should have just called up the wife and 
[04:38:30]  said look i'm naked swimming with fucking we should have taken kalua girls we should have taken patrice's  advice from yesterday what would you do if a really hot girl comes along you would smother  not a really hot girl that particular bitch you showed all right i would have smothered my girl  with a pillow that's what we should have told uh the girls at the time man would you  fuck the dead would you fuck your dead girlfriend after you smother and then go 
[04:39:00]  fuck the girl if that's what she wanted we would have told the skinny dipping broads yeah we'll be  right back you got to give us about 45 minutes and they would say why and we would both say because  we're going home to smother our girls so we could be with what y'all had it done even if you were free  to get that pussy i it's some the the thing i get from you guys is that you wouldn't have anyway it's  kind of like you it's good you wasn't in a relationship because i don't see either one of  you really did we were fucking those bitches if you even if you had a chance we were faithful  guys imagine what a great news story that would have been a chance uh both both wives of shock jocks 
[04:39:30]  well i wasn't married well i want to make that i hope he wasn't married but you was in one of  those relationships though right i guess i guess it's like i don't see it as the relationship got  i got worse i think you know you're not doing viagra are you you still is still working i don't know  i've got so much pent-up come i need no viagra oh have you have you done a threesome yet the first girl 
[04:40:00]  that i uh fucked since uh when we got um divorced uh it was uh i fucked her like six times one night  it was crazy oh my god how old was she louis i stopped 27 uh but so young but still look like a  woman woman louis found like louis found like coke penis but that's what it is because he didn't get  he didn't get the pussy in his formative pussy years he was he was being faithful in half of those  and the other half he wasn't getting it now fucking you should he's getting you that should 
[04:40:30]  still be on tv pussy yeah god i remember when i one uh night at the virus tour i think it was the philly  show uh one of the strippers what was uh really really talking to me a lot and then she came into  my dressing room with me she said can i come with you to your dressing room and i was like okay and i  i was married and my heart was pounding was you trembling he was trembling my god no no jesus  and i didn't know what i was like i'm not gonna cheat with this woman but i do want her to be in my 
[04:41:00]  dressing room she came in my dressing room we were both standing there i would feel really awkward i  wasn't sure what was gonna happen and then this some chaperone woman some 50s you know leathery skin  woman fucking threw the door open and just went to the girl get out out oh really there's some girl  some woman that travels with them that keeps them from uh from fucking the towns can i ask  everybody a dude question there's a dude question what if can you and i'm being real hypothetical can 
[04:41:30]  you tell your wife or your ex-girlfriend your ex-wife or your ex-girlfriend that i cheated on you  when we were together what would be the point of that i'm saying can you is that i think is that a  bad thing to do like if you go ah yeah depends on how the relationship went if you want to rub it in  her fucking face if she's a bitch then yeah you tell her i'm with louie what's the you make  shit up i'm just curious just to rub it in patrice why would you say tell that woman anything about 
[04:42:00]  anything right that means you care still okay let me let me change it because that is that was a goofy  question let me say all right listening to the story you you just said my mind was going in so i guess  you made sense when you did that now let me try to fix it yeah say you fuck that stripper in the  story yeah for the sake of telling that story and you fuck the stripper are you allowed to say it  after you get divorced that story or do you keep that story i didn't fuck that stripper 
[04:42:30]  hypothetically you keep that story i i didn't fuck that stripper  until the lawyers do what they have to do exactly that's that's a better way to put it  because i think the way y'all said it was right you know by the way you don't want to set them on  fire man you don't want to get them going by the way you were a saint when you were married yeah we're  still in the process of this divorce so do me a favor don't don't tell anybody that i've been  fucking any uh women yeah oh no of course not let's just put it this way louie louie has so much

[04:59:30]  no we're not gonna we're not gonna pick on you don't worry jesus christ calm down holy  shit it could work right and and never forget as she's talking right and in some weird it's gonna  be a weird rejection don't don't worry about it you you you establish yourself you know her  her her vagina is the only thing keeping her at the level of you mentally 
[05:00:00]  you're better than she is never forget it and she's kind of rejecting you and then think of  what and ask her what she does what's your talent what's your i don't know i don't i don't know  she has a vagina that's her thing that's the great equalizer conquer that mentally dude conquer  that and you'll understand that dude i'm coke logic on the ona show you understand what i'm saying  that means something somewhere that's a good opening line that's before she starts her spiel 
[05:00:30]  because she's thinking about what i fuck him automatic that's just that's that's what women  do you understand what i'm saying so her rejection is  fucking patrice you agree with some of that go ahead ma'am what are you what's your deal  what's my deal yes what do you do for a living i work for a toy company of course  that's the same that's the same thing the guy from family guy does

[05:03:30]  his basement you're insecure probably about being a big dude but john candy was a fucking big dude  and funny and respected you tell me women they want to fuck him they want to who you are that's  where that's where they're different than us they'll who you are as opposed to what you look  like that's that's the same trust me all of us deal with see actually i think that's a little  wrong i'm actually not so insecure it's just the um roll the dice you know it's just uh 
[05:04:00]  why are you rolling me  that's not gonna get you girls i got insecure listening to him to say that  i started feeling like that about myself like oh  no you walk into a bar and there's a uh a handful of women they own it 
[05:04:30]  and for that night you're uh you have your options and if they're not interested in you  that's one night off you know and uh just not very lucky so you think that's a luck of the draw  thing instead of a you know play play your hand kind of a thing yeah because i have no game  oh see that's just it yeah give me give me a little uh something i don't have pickup lines i'm  i'm a i'm a no pick up lines suck yeah i don't i don't know what it is no it's it's  fucking attitude with patrice i've seen it it's it's fucking mystic you can't even he's 
[05:05:00]  that's right because on the sidewalk after the show he does it oh my god he flirts with every  girl that goes by and and any any of us use the same lines we'll get smacked in the fucking face but  they just go with it it's just belief and i have to say because my girl always listens i tell  of this about me and i have to flirt i have because that's how i'm sexy i'm not sexy like  her like she's sexy like guys want to she just walks down the street she's sexy and i have to  deal with that a lot of times because i've been with her so long that i forget how sexy she is so 
[05:05:30]  i'll walk 20 paces behind just to see guys want to fuck her so i can go all right let me i keep  forgetting i forget i see this bitch nude and walking around at her not the sexiest thing but dudes in the  street want to fall over so i tell her look that's not me i got to talk to bitches every day  because so you can feel that there are some women attracted that's the equivalent of her  looking hot yes you you know play is me talking to your game yeah i have to because then the energy  of women thinking i'm attractive has to she has to smell it on me you know what i'm saying so what 
[05:06:00]  you have to do is be psychotically confident it's but not arrogant you just have to be psychotic  like there's no fucking way this guy thinks he can fuck me you understand what i'm saying there's  no way and you go yes there is you have to give that off and but i can't tell you how to give it  off but how you feel the most confident is when you're doing like you see how you handed opie that  thing and said play it and you just had confidence that it was going to be good you have a pride an 
[05:06:30]  ethic in your shit gotta have the same ethic in your confidence somehow which are and use your  cartoons motherfucker tonight that's right tonight you are coke logic when they see you oh my god  that's coke there's gonna be some in there that's like wow into you yeah stalker patty will be  he's such a nice person i like his personality pathetic i'm talking like you know you're a  fucking cartoon recluse motherfucker you know what i mean do you feel me get some
