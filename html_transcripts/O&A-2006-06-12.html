<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opens with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, calling themselves various offensive names like "rabid radio retards" and "perverts," and similarly insulting nicknames for the crew ("Hurricane Ben," "Martini Steve," "E-Rock").  The show begins with a lengthy, humorous discussion about a booger found on Opie's hand, detailing its origin and various nose-picking techniques.

They then review HBO's Sunday night lineup, covering *Entourage*, Jimmy Norton's *Lucky Louie*, and *Deadwood*, praising the latter's use of strong language, and *Torgasm* starring Bob Kelly.  The discussion shifts to Norton's successful book signing at Tower Records, where over 600 people attended, with anecdotes about his encounter with a personal trainer and Club Soda Kenny's attempts to control fans "stickering" elderly people with Opie and Anthony "WOW" stickers. Listener calls react to Kenny's actions.  They discuss the media attention surrounding a Jim Learitz interview about steroid use, the NBA finals (favoring the Dallas Mavericks), and the media's coverage of the controlled explosions at Ground Zero and Tropical Storm Alberto, deeming it overly sensationalized. The Puerto Rican Day Parade is covered, focusing on its sometimes unruly nature,  including listener calls and descriptions from the hosts. A caller, Steve, coins the term "hispandex" to describe women's attire at the parade.  Anthony expresses anger towards a large, disruptive woman at the Comedy Cellar. The show concludes with Anthony's recounting of an uncomfortable childhood shower experience with his father.

A segment focuses on listener calls detailing awkward childhood sex education and hygiene experiences. Callers share traumatic first sex talks, showering with parents or siblings, unconventional bathroom habits in other countries, and a father who walked around naked.  News items discussed include a man paralyzed after penile implant surgery, Susan Sarandon's encounter with a horny dolphin, and English soccer hooligans with Nazi symbols.  The Tony Awards are discussed, along with Andrew Dice Clay's reaction to the event.  A "Shame, Shame, Shame" segment about a man confronting people illegally parked in handicapped spots is also covered.

A later segment heavily criticizes a man, Bill, who confronts people illegally parked in handicapped spots, using violent and insulting language towards him while playing clips of his confrontations. They transition to an interview with a vulgar and sexually suggestive interview with a Radiohead tour bus driver.  The hosts then take a "walk" outside, making crude comments about passersby. Back in the studio, Jim Norton joins them to discuss his HBO show, *Lucky Louie*, listener feedback (both positive and negative), its use of a laugh track, and his personal experiences filming it.  Hurricane Ben and Ramone also appear, along with a "Dump Report" of listener bathroom experiences. Elo from XM Satellite Radio is also involved in a conversation regarding a commercial.

Another segment focuses on *Tourgasm*, starring Dane Cook, Bob Kelly, and Jay Davis, specifically a clip where Davis cries after Kelly's jokes about porn and sex.  The conversation includes highly offensive language and commentary on women and sex. Irish comedian Tommy Tiernan joins as a guest, with a film crew documenting the appearance. They discuss his career, adapting his material for American audiences, cultural differences, and blasphemy charges in Ireland.


A final segment with Tommy Tiernan covers his comedic style (targeting religion), censorship on Letterman,  filming a documentary (including visits to Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church and an Indian reservation in Nebraska), and the World Cup. The conversation is rambling and filled with crude humor and offensive language, including racial and ethnic slurs. Tiernan promotes his upcoming shows throughout the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie. 
[00:00:30]  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's like, shut down!  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating poop that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No.  What's wrong, Eric? 
[00:01:00]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  I really don't know, though.  I hope nobody else is putting stuff around the studio. 
[00:01:30]  Well, now we've got to share with everyone else.  Of course.  Some things happen right before the mics go on.  Just before the big intro to the Opian Anthony show, I looked at Jimmy Norton and Anthony and said,  I hope this is my booger.  All of a sudden, I looked down and there's a booger on my hand.  And I wasn't going, I wasn't digging or anything.  I would assume it's yours.  But I don't know where it came from. 
[00:02:00]  Out of your nose.  Probably under that desk.  Where do they all come from?  I was touching under the desk.  I was touching the CDs.  Maybe E-Rock left a booger on one of the CDs by accident.  I don't know.  I'm just hoping it was my booger that ended up on my hand.  Just taste it.  No, I got rid of it.  If E-Rock was also a nose picker, that would just put him over the top.  He's not, though.  I don't think I've ever seen him dig. 
[00:02:30]  He saves him all for later.  Blows him onto a plate and eats him.  Oh.  I need a tissue.  Like, not now.  No, I'm saying, generally speaking.  Thank you.  Kenny lunged for a tissue box like a Secret Service man taking a bullet.  He lunged for a tissue when I said I need a tissue.  I wasn't finished.  I need a tissue any time I'm going to futz around with what's up my nose.  I have to blow my nose out or use a tissue, make something, and do a little digging. 
[00:03:00]  And there's no way I can just pull something out and then have to deal with it.  You've never touched your own snot?  What is wrong with you?  Dude, snot in the line of disgusting things that can come out of a person is higher up on my list than it should be.  I understand, but it's your snot.  Don't care.  That's why I'm just hoping if it was my snot that ended up on my left hand, so be it.  Oh, well.  Don't care.  It happens.  Don't care. 
[00:03:30]  Never just pulled out a nice big one?  If it was...  Stop it.  I bet you grabbed it off the CD, man.  You probably touched the CD case.  It's some other jock.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  What?  This is disgusting.  That's probably what it was.  Yeah, it probably was.  This snot is just too heinous to deal with.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Can't.  Sometimes my...  And I have to kind of be in front of a mirror with the tissue, so I'm sure I've gotten everything. 
[00:04:00]  And make sure, you know, because sometimes you go...  You make the little Roto-Rooter thing with the tissue and...  No, see, you just screw it in and then you slowly pull it out and make sure everything comes out.  And then I've got to take another tissue real quick and cover it up.  And then make a ball out of it and throw it in the garbage.  You take your fingernail.  No, you don't.  You scrape.  And it looks like you have a frosted mini wheat with brain matter on it.  Exactly.  No, you don't.  Yeah, you grow one...  You don't.  You're disgusting.  These are the tools of the trade right here. 
[00:04:30]  Tools of the trade.  Right here.  I'm holding them up.  Four fingers?  And look, there's all different sizes depending on what's going on.  And thumb is no good.  Well, sometimes.  And then you grow the fingernails just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  To get to those hard to reach places.  I am getting skeeved just talking about it.  I can't deal with that.  With...  With...  With...  I hope for your sake it was yours. 
[00:05:00]  But I hope for the rest of our sakes that it was something other than that.  Stop it!  I bet what happened was you probably grabbed the mic and pulled it and didn't even realize  it was on your hand.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  I'm just going to touch a lot of stuff.  I'm going to check my microphone.  It's fine.  Don't touch anything.  So, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  I was just hoping it was mine.  That's all.  Just hoping.  Just hoping.  I'm not really sure.  It was a little too clear and perfect for one of mine. 
[00:05:30]  Your best Purell.  So, I think we're all a little tired.  We had to watch HBO last night.  Three big shows on last night.  It's the big Sunday HBO thing.  Entourage was okay.  It was reintroducing some characters and setting up the season.  So, there was nothing really there.  I was watching it and I never watch it.  So, it was kind of good to have the setup.  That was...  Actually, I didn't know who they were either.  I didn't realize that that was redundant for a lot of people who knew to cast.  I loved it when I saw it. 
[00:06:00]  I had no idea.  It was just kind of a setup for the whole season.  You know, showing where all the characters are and what's going to happen.  And then, of course, Lucky Louie.  Bravo, Jimmy.  Yes.  Bravo.  Yes.  Bravo.  Our own Jimmy Norton starring in Lucky Louie.  Very proud.  Very proud.  He had one scene in the first episode, but he gets more and more as the season goes on.  Yes.  I enjoyed it once again, even though I've seen it a couple times before last night's debut.  Deadwood also debuted.  Last night, really? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  That was the season premiere.  Everyone told me you've got to get into Deadwood.  I never did it.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And now I'm kind of bummed out that I did.  This is the last season of Deadwood, right?  Yeah.  Now you've got to pick up the past seasons and...  Yeah, I could do that.  Troll through those.  It's pretty cool, though.  Which is third season?  A lot of violence.  A lot of bad language.  Number three?  Yeah.  Okay.  And a lot of...  It's just...  So you've got to really pay attention.  They speak so eloquently.  These dirtbags in the, you know, whatever it is, Montana, that they're in. 
[00:07:00]  But yet they speak so eloquently.  It's like those Civil War letters.  It's like, my dearest Clementine, I am here amongst the refuse of humanity that...  You've got letters now.  Yeah, we're hanging out and blah, blah.  Letters.  It's called email.  Yeah, I know emails.  Who's writing letters?  Well, maybe soldiers these days.  Ha, ha, letters.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  But, yeah, so sometimes you've got to listen.  You've got to...  What the hell is... 
[00:07:30]  He said it beautifully, but what the hell did he just say?  Unless he threw the C word in, I have no idea what he's talking about.  But, yeah, that debuted last night.  Had to watch that.  Yeah.  A little sleepy.  And then I watched Torgasm, Dane Cook's project.  Yes.  Yes.  actually our our pal bob kelly is going to be a breakout star in tourgasm yeah i watched you  with bobby um yeah bob kelly is just a natural did he cry at any point no he's making other 
[00:08:00]  people cry i mean sitting with jimmy watching it no that faggot bob is bob it translated to  is just so what a fat anti-social creep bobby is and uh i thought breaking some uh ground over  there huh i really thought bobby and i told this i thought he came off really good in it  yeah because he's just an ass he's just he's like a regular he's a guy yeah he's just like you just  want to it's like it's hard to if you did watch everybody else you see that bobby is the guy  that is like he's the one you'd want to hang out with out of the yeah yeah absolutely yeah the 
[00:08:30]  normal guy absolutely that stupid muslim skull cap he was wearing what is up with him wearing  wearing that i don't know it really annoyed me i want to remove from his head with a shovel  he's been wearing those hats for years though i know he finds the the ugliest hats we live in the  greatest city in the world and he he finds himself a hat he finds the ugly hat store but uh he's great  in tourgasm definitely and uh really fast before we get into this week's uh festivities we gotta 
[00:09:00]  talk about uh almost jimmy day on friday it ended with us at tower records 66 and broadway here in new  york city and i guess the people at tower records uh said they've never seen a bigger turnout it was  huge for a signing there was well over 600 people there yeah it was unbelievable if not more the line  was so long that people were uh you know going home they bailed on the whole thing but i think we got  it over 600 people through the doors definitely a pleasant surprise jimmy was signing his uh hbo uh 
[00:09:30]  half hour comedy special and and uh and um copies of lucky louis and and we were there we were having a  good time it was great man it was a lot of fun and uh it was the first appearance that we did in  new york since coming back to commercial radio what's up jimmy i forgot you want to talk about  what this is this is like what an ass i am while we're sitting there at the table this guy walks up  with this really hot girlfriend and they say hello and he's he uh he goes uh because you want to train  and he looks at his girlfriend and uh i'm like yeah i mean i'm like why not she's hot man i would 
[00:10:00]  love one oh no dude i was like looking at this chick i'm like i'm gonna get to hit this yeah um  i'm like you got a card or something and he hands me a card and it says trainer of course  physical personal trainer is that what disgusted with myself you want to train dude it was so 
[00:10:30]  conspiratorial the way he said it and then she kind of smiled i don't know how to engage in real  contact right the first thing you thought of was that that that you are going to be standing on line  after he's finished and then you go pulling a train and even after he handed me his card i was  helping yeah she she's in good shape then good you are awful i know i'm such that's some kind of  mental problem there where that's the first thing that hits you yeah one of the instead of like 
[00:11:00]  training one of the highlights from friday's uh signing at tower records and a lot of the past and  the faithful listeners of the show are bitching and complaining because uh club soda kenny had to  reprimand some of the people online yeah it was big fodder on the message boards over the  weekend and how kenny was a killjoy uh at the appearance on friday you want to tell everyone  what you had to announce to the line on two occasions i had to go out and uh speak to the 
[00:11:30]  nice people that were waiting online for three hours to get signatures and that was only as a result of  tower records asking me to because they were getting complaints because of the hoity-toity people on the  upper west side and what were some of the people online doing that you had to go out and chastise  because they're really mad at you now i know i know i got smashed on uh the message boards over the  weekend the the first time they were just doing the whole you drop something thing uh-huh which is 
[00:12:00]  always funny it's a fun joke somebody walks by try it at home when somebody walks by you say you drop  something and then you just look away inconspicuously and continue on your walk and you'll watch that  person's turn around and look around on the ground at them and it's just huge fun for everyone  involved right which i think was invented by uh superstar jim norton wow no well you drop something  yeah no that's something you do in childhood but i mean uh as an adult uh florentine no i got a 
[00:12:30]  credit for you with that absolutely and he's one of the greatest things he ever did was stupid jeff  norris was standing there and jim there's three women walking like ahead and jim hid behind this  divider and yelled miss please help me and then hid and then jeff is stuck out there by himself  so now i gotta miss please help me  hey we're gonna have to do that one on our walk man we're gonna have to take that one king of  pranks also yeah i'll have to credit him though yeah and then the second time uh the manager of 
[00:13:00]  tower records asked me to go out because um the fans were stickering old people as they walked by  with wow stickers and there's pictures up on the websites of old people walking down the sidewalk  with big opian anthony wow wow stickers on their back just stickering old people with wow  that's a great promotion yeah but i i mean oh it certainly is with all listeners i'm surprised it 
[00:13:30]  wasn't stars of david just slapping on them but when anthony we were sitting there and anthony was  told that they were stickering old people and he goes i hope they're putting them over the nose and  mouth help the families you know what a burden they can be hello inheritance  i didn't yell anybody i just cordially went out there and tried to reason with them  ah you can't reason with our pets i know and they're an angry mob something like  yeah yeah i mean it you know and and they say like we're uh hypocritical and do as i say not as i do 
[00:14:00]  but you know nobody's a uh bigger proponent of uh stickering old people than you right  an annoyance using the elderly wow what happened because i am a public nuisance yes you are but uh  it's just there's a time and a place for everything and i guess it was fun while it lasted but it just  had to come to an end yeah let's say hi to uh rob in white plains one of the guys you yelled at  uh kenny rob what's up hey what up boys hey man you know what it was at the time kenny came out and 
[00:14:30]  my my man my boy's son he threw a sticker on kenny and we were like oh that's the funniest thing ever  kenny kind of like looked like he was going to hit the little kid you know and kenny went nuts and  we were like what is he serious saying that you know oh we're not representing the ona show the  way they should be represented and at the time we were like look at this hypocrite you know what is  he crazy but now i mean kenny did you really say that yeah they got they gotta you know represent 
[00:15:00]  properly can't be that was properly that was properly exactly exactly what we thought you  know like because some of the listeners were coming up to us at the uh you know when they  got to the front table saying what was going on outside i was laughing really hard i thought wow  that is uh i assume i assumed kenny had said it uh just to kind of smooth things over and then you  would have plausible deniability later on by saying well i did tell them but you know kind of with a wink 
[00:15:30]  go ahead do what the hell you want with the stickers we don't care it was cool it was cool  afterwards and and out of respect for kenny and the show we were like all right cool he said you  know he yelled at us doesn't want us to do it anymore and that was it nobody got stickered after  that but it was funny people's little rascals were getting stickers old people's backs it was the  highlight it was the highlight of the line you know got everybody was having a good time and making  their own fun yeah yep there you go all right boys all right thank you all right let's go to omer  omer what's up omer hi um kenny you're you're lying man he comes out and he's like listen you guys

[00:17:00]  kenny's intentions i think don't come off right either they come off perfectly right because he'll  say things to people like um you're not representing the opian anthony show and it's like people like  what that's not comfortable for anyone to hear no i'm very misunderstood fee-fi-fo-fum  look at me i'm big and dumb that's right giant all right let's go to ariel we'll move on to other  things in my mustaches hey you shaved by the way i did you promised us at the friday night dinner that

[00:25:30]  it's gonna be uh you know in the same place oh yeah the building you might hear a little shake  rattle and roll if you're if you're right next to ground zero yeah i don't think it's gonna be  quite the volume of two buildings coming down i don't even think you'll feel that  so sick of the freedom tower i hate the name of it freedom liberty anything with freedom and liberty  in the name it's a patriot it just reeks of overcompensating and just rebuild the twin towers 
[00:26:00]  exactly exactly well i mean make them safer obviously but the same design yeah enough already  but no one's gonna work on the upper floors they will make it storage then believe me exactly or build  them better build them where it's safer whatever you gotta do or call the freedom tower something else  it's just a dumb name freedom we have uh one more clip about this uh just unbelievable news that's 
[00:26:30]  going down uh going on but the building contractor says the planned explosions are very different from  what happened on 9-11 oh is it really why would you say that that's what got me that's what got me  when i heard that it's like you have to actually say gonna be very different what we're gonna do when  we start the uh freedom tower foundation we're gonna take two 767s uh full of fuel and people and  then we're just gonna plow them into the ground because that's gonna make the biggest hole uh that 
[00:27:00]  we can use to pour uh the concrete and that's the way to save some time and that's what we're gonna do  instead of controlled explosions that we normally use in construction idiots of course it's different  why would you what a why would you say that bitch a dumb news writer and even a dumber reporter right  who just opens her mouth and whatever's on the teleprompter she says spills out of her maw yes her  stupid hole in her face exactly the term it is oh it's a hole with teeth in the face second most 
[00:27:30]  intelligent hole in her body absolutely yeah maybe third ah third i'd go third fifth if you count the  years but the building contractor says the planned explosions are very different from what happened  on 9-11 really last will loosen rocks for footings for the new freedom tower contractor tishman  construction says the alternative to the occasional 15 second blast is this  jackhammers and backhoes would use 50 000 gallons of diesel to do the job the contractor also says the 
[00:28:00]  blast would add up to 10 minutes over two months doing the job with construction equipment would  take 2500 hours of drilling the drawbacks include crews stopping the path train they'll shut down parts  of vc street and it's boring during explosions four times a day two to three days a week neighbors  though don't seem to mind happy i mean works and finally getting done and these are test 
[00:28:30]  explosions if they're approved by the port authority and fire department they will last  over the course of two months it's a non-story it's an absolute non-story can they just get the  news people and stack them up over the explosion sites and blow them up because you see them all  doing their little stand-up we're here we hear minutes away from baboom gone they go flying cultures  they go talk oh they go cartoon flying yeah they love to sensationalize because just because there's 
[00:29:00]  going to be explosions at ground zero they have to tie it in controlled bring up people's emotions  and each blast lasts about a second i'm hearing or even less than a second nothing it's just a quick  you know yeah blam it's a yeah that's it that's all you hear thank god they clarify it's gonna be  different than 9 11 i was very concerned that so was i i was gonna be a replica yeah those gonna  be pretty similar exactly the same spit in her face so you think that story is dumb well uh it's 
[00:29:30]  hurricane uh season everybody oh yeah oh boy and let me let me let me preface hurricane alberto is  on the way by saying just wait for the first gulf uh hurricane the first one that's in the gulf  you will see the news hoping creaming over the the the remote chance that new orleans might get hit  that that will be the biggest thing oh my god where where's the storm track taking it we go live now 
[00:30:00]  to new orleans are they ready are the levees ready they are waiting just just jacking at the prospect of  it yep well the first one is already on its way alberto where is it alberto it's giving um florida  some rain the next couple of days that's it is it a hurricane or is it a tropical storm they're  calling it hurricane alberto it is a hurricane now oh my goodness so we got the uh latest audio here 
[00:30:30]  it is hurricane alberto tropical storm alberto okay yeah tropical storm i hate the way she said  alberto alberto well you have to say it like alberto alberto you can't say alberto was he marching  in the uh puerto rican day parade yesterday alberto creating havoc wherever he marched  yeah had that to deal with here in new york city too oh i fleed i fleed man did you fled  i i fleed i fleeted i fleeted or flooded no i fleeted it you have to uh i said i thought it was 
[00:31:00]  a good weekend to leave manhattan it really is because they get a little unruly well they uh  they have a certain zest for life certain zest for living the puerto rican day parade gets a little  unruly sometimes yes well yesterday i watched msnbc they had an investigative report thing that they do  and i love watching all those on prisons stuff but they showed this captured on tape segment and 
[00:31:30]  last night they just happened to show the 2000 uh puerto rican day parade uh with the videotaping  of all the wilding that was also known as christmas with the drenching of the girls with water and  they're trying to pick them up like bowling balls and they're smacking them and they're ripping their  tops off and it was just no one was safe that day no and no one did anything like the biggest  part of that story was look at the crowd just looking not getting worked up or excited or not  just kind of they just looked like it was a show going on these women just being sexually assaulted 
[00:32:00]  they actually this parade actually has rape in the brochure and it's scheduled it says meet at the  park at 5 30 all rapes will begin after 5 30. is that right after the six-year-olds dressed as  prostitutes go by on the street can you puerto rican people uh have some uh i don't know  modesty modesty with your children a little more appropriate appropriately dressed i can understand  if they're women because they're women are just dressed like uh what they call a hoochie mama 
[00:32:30]  like a hoochie mama with just boobs hanging out of these little uh midriff tops and stuff and  little short shorts and they're marching and stuff and then you'll see like nine ten  year old girls walking down you got mini me versions yeah same things mini me versions  of their hoochie mamas unbelievable gangs there you know gangs marching in the parade in all fairness  though there's no problems uh this year but uh no there was some controversy leading up to the 
[00:33:00]  parade because they they put the word out to the businesses on fifth avenue and the really nice  like uh buildings on fifth avenue some of the nicest stores in the world they were side of  rodeo drive are on fifth avenue they were begging the businesses not to board up their windows and  doorways this year yeah makes it look bad well i'll tell you why there's been no trouble since  pretty much since 2000 is because the police presence now is unbelievable god bless our men in blue 
[00:33:30]  helicopters rooftop observation undercover in the crowd uh and just a huge uniform presence  everywhere when i was uh driving back into manhattan last night i couldn't believe they were still all  over the place the cops even though the parade was hours over yeah i think keith was stuck in the  middle of that one too really yeah you want a nice sunday off watching some games and you guys stand in  the middle of that a little uh well we went off on a little tangent there but hurricane alberto it's  not a hurricane it's a it's a tropical depression yeah but they have to talk about on the news because 
[00:34:00]  tropical storm because hurricanes are very hot right now as far as the news organizations go  tropical storm alberto is approaching the florida coastline and as it does people are making  preparations like packing stores and stocking up on supplies most of florida's west coast under a  tropical storm watch as alberto strengthens strengthens in the gulf not expected however to  become a hurricane but as mike woods know uh tropical storms can wreak quite a bit of havoc  themselves sandy hook new jersey we go mike woods on a gorgeous gorgeous monday morning mike's got 
[00:34:30]  nothing hi mikey hi there lucy yeah isn't it amazing i love it see out at the beaches at five  o'clock in the morning when it's all yours i mean check it out i mean it doesn't get much better  than that we've got uh sandy hook new jersey the beach so we're talking about the new jersey shore  today and gonna give you some swim safety tips in just a little while because it's gonna be quite a  wait a minute that that could be the worst improv i've ever heard a human being do isn't that horrible  that's mike woods he's one of the worst here in new york is he the black weather man he's the black 
[00:35:00]  weather guy they go to and he he never has anything he has nothing in that stupid head of his he is the  worst at improv he can't do it he doesn't know when to get out of it like he can't just get out of  his improv and into the weather how many times are you gonna say yeah we're here at the uh the beach  the weather you get the sand the sky sandy hook jersey shore uh uh the beach you're here uh by  yourself shells there's shells here just sand shells jellyfish uh and speaking of sand 
[00:35:30]  uh it's gonna rain on it yeah beach it'll hit the sand some point well let's get i got nothing  let's get another clip here so let's show you the radar and satellite across the country you can see  not a whole lot happening here in the tri-state area say that again focus is actually the tropical  storm not a lot happening in my brain back to him this head of mine right he's the worst tri-state 
[00:36:00]  area the big focus is actually the tropical storm which is down in the gulf of mexico you can see the  showers and storms that aren't necessarily around the center of that storm but still it looks like it's  going to uh gain a little strength gain a little organization and then swing across northern  florida somewhere near tampa bay over the next uh about 36 hours or so right now the winds are at 50  miles per hour and it probably will strengthen a little bit more so and become a fairly strong  tropical storm as it passes over the north end of florida and then heads out toward the carolinas and 
[00:36:30]  that's why we have to watch this storm very closely because it could swing fairly close to us and  definitely kick up the surf and possibly add some showers to the east coast as well it doesn't look  like we're taking a direct impact from that oh my god direct impact from that doesn't look like we're  taking a direct impact from that storm look at the words he's using yeah it's nothing it's a rainstorm  it's not even a hurricane and not going to be a hurricane yeah and the odds that we would ever get a 
[00:37:00]  direct impact are are so ridiculous we'll get we you know this early in the season by the way the  the water is uh it has to be a lot warmer yeah for us to take a direct oh but they gotta get the  local little angle we're gonna get some weather from this eventually when it works its way up the  coast as a drizzle really but drizzle can be annoying you don't know what intermediate swiper  setting to set and you know sometimes your wiper goes but if your windshield's too dry sometimes you 
[00:37:30]  get a little too much rain before it uh goes again and this could cause a problem during the commute  i got nothing back to you let's go to steve in uh stony brook steve horrid horrid weather  steve hate that hello hey steve good morning guys good morning steve hey i work for an airline we  go down to puerto rico uh quite often and uh we got a special word for the hoochie mamas down there  yeah these two-year-old ladies wearing their uh their tank tops and their uh and their tiny little 
[00:38:00]  pants with their junk hanging out and we call that his spandex his spandex you see a lot of camel toe  do you oh yeah i love that yeah his spandex i like that thank you sir spandex latin women are are  fantastic they they're just they're really sexy but the problem is the puerto rican day parade  there's no weight limit cut off yes who dresses like that i don't mind if some like like 19 year  old chick dresses like that but some big fatso who's in her 40s big fatty get a hold of yourself 
[00:38:30]  yes there's something about the uh hispanic and uh african-american communities that uh it doesn't  matter how big a gal gets she says she looks good to herself she's gonna dress like that well god  bless her anthony i look good i look yeah there was this is i just got my hair did my her did  speaking of fat women uh i was at the cell last night um and there's a little little to do in  the corner this is how this is what society is and ava who is who runs the comedy cellar uh who is 
[00:39:00]  manny's wife uh i hear her she's shushing somebody come on keep it down a little bit and then five  minutes later i see this big fat girl big fat girl walk in front of me uh on the way out the door  she leaves in a huff big fat girl and so afterwards i see ava and i go what was that  she goes well i shushed her while you were on and when ava goes could you keep it down this  fat girl turned around and put her fingers up and went i got it and then four minutes later said 
[00:39:30]  to ava you made me so uncomfortable i have to leave and walked out i got it i saw her upstairs  this fat fat girl who didn't like being shushed i've never you know i wanted to bite her you know  where i wanted to bite her between the shoulder and neck on the back oh like where i would if i  was where a roll of fat would be on her and she was she had like three quarter length pants on and  mopey dumpy mop hair if you're listening if you are the fat girl who was talking i wanted to bite you 
[00:40:00]  they i they physically had to keep me from walking over to her and just taking a bite out of her  saying to her you're uncomfortable you're talking during the show and she was just i just kept saying  fat and i kept saying things like this yammering mountain the monster at the bar oh just just a  big fat girl victim didn't like being shushed did you fat life of the party that's what's wrong with  society she couldn't understand what a cumbersome burden she is to everybody it's uh people that 
[00:40:30]  have this self-importance and i was the sweetest person on earth she wouldn't yell at you she was  just like she probably asked her nicely to be quiet i know how she is she wouldn't yell at the woman  there's this thing that goes on in anything public uh it's just there's people that feel they are the  most important person on the face of the earth that for some reason they have blinders on and no one  else is there and they're free to just carry out their business and go about their life no matter 
[00:41:00]  how inconvenient it is for everyone else or bothersome it is for everybody else goes for the  cell phones at the in the movie theaters and uh you have people yapping at comedy shows uh people  yelling stuff out enough we got the uh you're not special okay you made me uncomfortable yeah how did  she buy you a medium stupid self-centered elephant she brought you a salad by accident 
[00:41:30]  without bacon bits sprinkled on it you want some bacon bits and croutons i'm eating healthy have a big  plate of oreos to bring over to fat people at comedy clubs that won't be quiet because you know  they won't be using their mouth for anything but down in those oreos they should take a hammer and  mush the oreos and then the staff should like spit into it like a bunch of birds and that's how it  should be lubricated and then you should just shovel it in with a spoon and make this noise  okay there's another way to look at it  scope scope 
[00:42:00]  was she about a size 14  was she a great big loud person  all right we'll take a break we got some audio from the puerto rican day parade  we'll see how it went i'm hearing there was no real problems so but we got uh j-lo and bloomberg and  parade goers talking about the puerto rican day parade that happened here in new york city  yesterday and they're saying it was a hundred percent success of course it was 
[00:42:30]  it's the one virus spreading across america  mr are you okay that really looked like it hurt mr mr mr mr okay goodbye  i can't tell one from the other i don't know who this one is what his name yeah  no no no i'm i'm turning around to the large screen i i know the interns blah blah blah we 
[00:43:00]  don't know their names and they get all the orders wrong what else is new it's been happening since  we started in radio but uh on the big screen behind you uh first storm aims at florida hello  alberto why is he wearing that stupid ring hello and they have to show the surf and there's nothing  going on nothing there's people walking and playing right there's little kids splashing around and  now they're showing uh louisiana look now they gotta show new orleans right now they gotta show a real 
[00:43:30]  hurricane with roofs blowing off and damage that real hurricanes look man hurricanes are hot we  understand that shark attacks hot this time of year hurricanes hot this time of year but let's wait  until a real one comes along nothing's gonna happen with this alberto nothing but they have to start  in with the fear gotta start well hurricane season has started officially with alberto  let's say hi to steve in boston steve what's going on hey what's going on guys hey steve 
[00:44:00]  what do you say steve oh first i gotta say you guys are the best i've been listening to you when  you were on uh you know that other crappy station uh which one in new york we've been on a lot of  crappy stations for some reason i don't think we've ever worked for a good station i gotta be  honest with you they always bring us in to clean up the mess well i'm happy and that's what makes  me good so you know what i was gonna say is i was up in boston a couple weekends ago it was ona 
[00:44:30]  stickers plastered like pretty much everywhere my favorite was right by uh wrigley field uh you know  no parking anytime no parking was covered up by wrigley field in boston you what dummy that place i  don't know i pissed on the wrigley field in boston so oh wait all right so you're at wrigley park  fennway park here you go all right i'm just getting over a really long weekend guys you know you got  to bear with me uh we really don't have to watch this here's the beauty of being us your long weekend 
[00:45:00]  will now be suffered by you and your bored friends you know what what you try to do what you what you  try to do in radio i want to tear down one of the walls you come back from break with maybe a quick  phoner with something that's happening with the show and when and i picked steve yeah i picked  steve he was supposed to say i was in boston and there are wow stickers everywhere and then i say  something like see they're breaking out the wow stickers in boston right thank you wbcn and then we  move on to something else a minute and a half into the uh phone call we realized steve had nothing 
[00:45:30]  because he decided to drink a little too much over the weekend i almost uh i think i almost got arrested  for walking into a a woman's locker room the other day a women's uh locker room yeah a women's  locker room yes why well uh i remember last week there was a lot of rain and stuff uh yeah so i figure  out how that has you walking into a woman's so i uh i went to the gym in a uh a hooded sweatshirt and  i didn't feel like bringing an umbrella so i had the hood on and i had it like pulled down tight around 
[00:46:00]  my face you and a bomber like yeah it was an oversized sweatshirt and i walk into my gym  and i walk into the locker room and uh i turn the corner and i'm staring at a lady in a tiny tiny  little towel she looks at me i look at her she starts screaming i say i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry  as i leave the locker room going oh my god i'm gonna be arrested because it looks like i went in 
[00:46:30]  there to rape her yeah did you oh of course not she only had a towel on and then i'm like oh my god  i'm sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry and then eventually when she realized that i was not gonna  rape her she's like it's okay it's okay i'm like no it's not okay i'm so embarrassed i'm so embarrassed  it's okay it's okay and i'm embarrassed i'm embarrassed i'm embarrassed as i walk out of the uh  the locker room see what happened is my uh my gym is uh redoing one the the ladies locker room yeah  redoing it so what they decided uh they decided to share the one remaining good locker room so on odd 
[00:47:00]  days the men's locker room which i i'm used to walking into uh becomes the uh the ladies locker  room and what do you guys use so you got to like look at a calendar go oh all right i could uh i could  use the men's locker room today but what yeah what happens on odd days for the other sex there's uh  there's enough of the locker room that's available just to do a quick change or something but there's  no showers you can't take a leak oh you can't you know shave in the nude by the sink because that's 
[00:47:30]  what you have to do if you're in a men's locker room yeah that's what guys do amen just stand by the  locker in shame and put your clothes on why do you got to parade around naked why do you have to shave  naked why do you have to brush your teeth naked guys just walk around and have conversations how  you doing bob how's that stock i told you about it and just like oh hanging out somebody fumbled with  anthony i'm convinced why because he reacts to nudity of other men too oddly i cannot stand nudity of 
[00:48:00]  other men i understand not like not seeking it out not going hey but uh are you he gets really  uncomfortable like it annoys yeah if you walk into a locker room you're going to see nudity  absolutely time to time yes the point i'm making the point i'm making is why do you have to be nude  to do certain things why do you have to be nude to shave why are you shaving at a at a gym anyway  shaving shaving nude chit-chatting is the worst the guy that's sitting there just you know 
[00:48:30]  picking his toenails naked talking talking to his buddy hey how you doing with his legs akimbo he's  got his foot up in his lap i like that the hell is that about walking around naked there are towels  wrap yourself up go from the shower to your locker uh i understand you're gonna have to at some point  drop your towel and put your undies on and then the rest of your clothes but that's when you're under 
[00:49:00]  pants but that's when that is done not during a chit-chat but i think in like i think that you're  uncomfortably you you're like abnormally uncomfortable like i can picture in his mind when he's getting  dressed but as he's drying off to when he's putting his underwear on he's going put it on before he  touches you put it on before he touches you that's what he's saying i know put the pants on before he  touches you i was never i would i will swear to you you probably don't remember i don't think you're  lying no i just think that all those times you think you were on a ferris wheel or eating cotton 
[00:49:30]  candy that's just what my mind told me although there's one instance i remember not of any type  of touching or anything but um my father decided at one point you did not shower with your father  that it was time to teach me and my brother to shower and not take baths anymore i think i i can't  i must have been six and my brother was probably seven so he broke out the video camera eight so  the old eight millimeter film camera came out him and six of his friends taught us home movies 
[00:50:00]  no it was time you know it was time to teach the boys how to shower instead of uh just you know  taking you went into a shower with your dad uh it was at home it doesn't matter it doesn't matter  no one said it was on the road right no that makes it better believe me this well you know  something this could be it then this could be it so uh my father's under the the water and i'm like  pinned against the back wall just kind of like i i i'm uncomfortable with the situation even at six 
[00:50:30]  years old i just didn't like this i've always been a very modest boy and very modest skinny little  legs in the shower with dear old dad of course and his italian hogs steamy your little fiona apple  body shivering and delicious i was all just shy and like cold in the corner because you're not brave  enough to get under the hot faucet seeing his dad that's too close to daddy it messed him up this is 
[00:51:00]  why he's so uncomfortable and i mean look maybe that's it you know what i don't blame him but but i i  i've heard these stories from other people in my life where they uh where they uh had a shower with  their dad at one point yeah it's it it got it got worse because he then like backed up by the uh  by the you know controls to the shower and said okay now you get under the water and soap yourself up 
[00:51:30]  but as he's standing there the water was still kind of hitting his head and streaming down his body  and as as you then if you're a guy and you have certain appendages the water will like come off  of that and look like he's doing something i got as opposed to just shower it looked like because you  know if you stick your arm out water is going to run down your arm uh down your finger and then and  then like stream off the tip of your finger right so any other appendage is going to react the same way 
[00:52:00]  so i thought he was in the middle of doing something it's about time we get into this  with anthony something that wouldn't end because as long as the water hit his the top of his head  it was going to look like he was doing something so he kept going come here and just get under the  water and i was like no no and i'm just looking down and looking at the water running off and going  no no i was horrified nick nolte was more comfortable in the prince of tides describing his childhood 
[00:52:30]  than you are how many showers did you take with your old dad it was a one and done my friend was  it i think this one anthony was 15 yeah it was one and done but why i saw why do i remember that  though you're right that that stands out in my mind it should stand out in your mind and it was  horrific to me that's a little weird and i'm sure the phones will light up with people that showered with  their dad and stuff i don't know i don't get it i i saw my dad's uh you know once what once and and 
[00:53:00]  how was that well we were at the bronx zoo and it was what and uh what we're at the bronx  comparing it with the elephant's trunk and we went and we went behind a bush  when he put peanut butter on it the lamb came over  through the fence  mama what's the lamb doing let's just don't say anything right just walk away just walk away  you know we uh we're at the bronx zoo the whole family and uh me and a few of the boys had to uh 
[00:53:30]  you know relieve ourselves yeah me and a few um maybe another brother or two i don't know  there was more than uh just me and my dad and we lined up at the urinals yeah and my dad was pretty  damn proud because he's he's mr uh superman stance almost superman stance uh steps back to  slightly too far never enjoyed anybody that did the superman stance and i'm next to him as close  as possible i gotta get it close as possible that's what i gotta do gotta get close as possible 
[00:54:00]  not only that i gotta position my hands like so no one can see from the side view what did you do  that shower so it looks like it looks like i'm a uh uh what's the what's the slogan for the  whopper it takes two hands to handle the whopper so then uh i uh i i looked over  and uh why why not why why not why why not why why not all right i'll i'll end this i got ocd we 
[00:54:30]  could do this all day you're not gonna win that one i just think it's funny i'm not gonna get an  answer either i would like to know why not like you know but you're looking around like a little  kid you know you peaked you peaked in the rest area did you go it wasn't a rest area you asked  it was the bronx zoo and it was the men's room that's both and both our dad was my pop both our  dads have since passed on so they're looking down now knowing this they're embarrassed in heaven it  was my pop they're avoiding eye contact in heaven did you mean you raised i don't know what happened 
[00:55:00]  let's have a beer i was just trying to teach him to shower yeah well mine peaked yeah mine peaked  yeah well look what it's like to have your kid yawning in the shower walking towards you i said  what are you looking at you little fairy and i guess it scarred him because now he can't put his  underpants on fast enough in a locker room and he hates snot well i don't know where that came from  well we'll find out one day maybe and uh your chin in that shower and all i can say is uh 
[00:55:30]  i uh yeah i i either looked myself or was there on view peripheral i don't know exactly something  moved in your peripheral and you turned your head but i saw but i saw and i said and i and i i looked  at it as a coming attraction i'm like all right i'm gonna be all right someday you went that's all i'm  gonna be all right someday no i didn't say it was nice but i was relieved i was relieved because 
[00:56:00]  i knew what i was sporting at the time i was 10 i was like oh all right this is what it's gonna  become 10 you didn't already feel that it was you were doing okay i had nothing at 10 wow  interesting i had nothing until 17 wow that's embarrassing i had puberty late  is that why you lost your virginity at a later age were you embarrassed  no nobody i was i was no i we've talked about this i was you looked like you were eight years

[01:00:00]  transform into a whole different place and yeah what really happened in my head the shower wasn't  on it wasn't a shower plumbing me it was a warehouse i had been bad and he was showing me the error of my  ways again can i uh can i tell the can i tell the sex story real fast do we have time well it all  depends on what sex story you're talking about i'm just saying segue from that shower wasn't right after  the bathroom but the superman stance i come from a big family and we didn't shower together apparently 
[01:00:30]  so after your dad a lot of you a lot of okay and we get confused and uh and you know the sex talk was  always awkward and just uncomfortable but i remember being in sixth grade i've told this  story on the air before i remember being in sixth grade and you go to you know school like any other  day with your little lunch box and or in my case it was a big wall bounce bag with a bruised apple and  a peanut butter and jelly sandwich made on pepperidge farm day old bread thank you mom people tend to 
[01:01:00]  live in clusters and and like uh some change that rattled around for my milk that i had to buy  an awful lunch worst lunches in in all of school anyway so uh i go to i go to the old uh washington  drive school they're in um in centerport show up for school like any other day and as we file through  the front doors after getting off the bus they go guys this way girls this way oh geez they're going 
[01:01:30]  to show the film they're going to show the film it's like this isn't like an ordinary day what are  they doing and they don't even warn you so they just march into the uh gymnasium one side is for the  guys one side is for the girls and they proceed to show the film bobby is starting to notice he's  growing hair in certain areas he didn't have it before hygiene is very i love life 
[01:02:00]  that was a horrible skipping films as you had the dancing hair the one piece of hair across the  screen yeah only the av kid would know where to stick the pencil to stop the film from jumping  right so um saw the film and that and then at the end of the film they said uh we've had we have  instructed all your parents uh that we're showing you the film today and if you have any questions uh  to ask your mommy and your daddy matter of fact we have encouraged your parents to discuss some of 
[01:02:30]  the stuff you saw in the film today a little further oh encouraged encouraged that's great so um you're  supposed to go from zero to a hundred in one day so i uh i get home from school that day and i walk in  the front door and my mom and my dad are there they're uncomfortable because they got they all  know they got the phone call or the letter or what have you and they asked how archaic way to do this  they asked how school was and i just saw it in their eyes that they were like uncomfortably uh trying 
[01:03:00]  to to start up the topic and so at that point i proceeded to run out of the house and climb up into an  apple tree and i refuse to come down i think i saw that picture on the saturday evening post cover  when you climbed up an apple taking outside the moxley residence i refuse to come down and then i  remember my dad trying to reason with me from the uh from the base of the apple tree while i'm way up  there was yelling stop being a faggot come down faggot i was i was not ready for the sex talk no and then

[01:21:00]  suing the hospital where he underwent a crippling penile implant surgery oh a 74 year old prostate cancer  survivor uh hope surgery would help him please his sweetheart instead it left him paralyzed  that's terrific that's terrific uh manuel chambers a retired warehouse worker claims in a lawsuit that 
[01:21:30]  he went to blah blah blah following his cancer battle and was advised to get a penile prosthetic so he  could remain sexually active right i remember exactly what what was he going for the blow up one or  something probably one of those hydraulic or pneumatic ones that have a pump magnetic yeah what what the hell  is that she drinks a weird um there's some kind of a drink you drink and if he's got like a magnetic  implant it just it works when you're that close to her stop it stop it stop it jimmy that is 
[01:22:00]  hysterically funny and i almost was believing it i'm like wait a minute does that can't possibly of  course it can't be what if you spill it somewhere  walking by a construction yard where they use one of those magnetic things to pick up  i was thinking that that might work i remember it can't i remember exactly what he said recall 
[01:22:30]  chambers who emigrated from blah blah blah he said your wife will be very happy when you go home  uh chambers of brooklyn father of three whose wife died in 1999 was keen to continue dating so he agreed  i had a girlfriend that's why i asked for the implant he said now i don't have anybody oh the  girl left him of course now your legs don't even work adios  prior to the operation uh the doctor i guess yeah the doctor uh uh anesthetized 
[01:23:00]  chambers with an injection to the lower back  back that's where things went wrong chambers said the doctor told the silver-haired retiree  that he should be able to walk around the same day but i couldn't walk i couldn't move my feet i  couldn't move my legs chambers said he went back to the doctor and a few days later because he still  couldn't walk he just passed by the bed he didn't stop chambers said he said he was too busy but chambers  who had played soccer baseball and cricket even after his retirement persisted he said the doctor 
[01:23:30]  eventually administered medication but never addressed the paralysis when i go to his office  he tests uh my pulse and tells me to come back in two weeks chambers said chambers told the doctor  to remove the implant last year the doctor did but problems persisted including bleeding the doctor  did not respond to requests why is he using the same doctor that paralyzed him yeah how about switching  physicians you dope the end of the story is he's not mad at the doctor he says there's no hard 
[01:24:00]  feelings hey kenny hey look at that oh that's not bad that's not bad kenny why is he going to the  same guy i don't know how many excuses can the guy come up with after three years while he can't walk  on an all-new house mr chambers is back oh all right right off on an old new house a penile implant  bungle oh nothing below the waste works house needs to harvest the junk of 20 people to cure one person

[01:25:30]  all right see you on a virus spreading across america we'll continue with some other uh  babble in just a bit  what's going on man hey who saw the tony awards last night oh oh i love the tonys  oh that was fabulous oh yeah i don't think uh a lot of guys uh watch the tonys 
[01:26:00]  ben was just saying uh some bar and you know the socks game was on and uh a couple of guys walked in  and said are you gonna be showing the tonys here it was like the scene in animal house when they walked  into that bar and everything just stopped you want to watch the game i don't think they're  switching off the game so you could watch uh the tonys where's our tonys expert where's our broadway 
[01:26:30]  expert steve c steve c is the tony expert of course he is this guy's seen more broadway plays than  anyone i know gay straight or gay anyone you have seen many many shows haven't you i have seen a fair  number of shows i've seen a couple i'm i'm a hack uh broadway guy though like i only see the ones  that the people that really appreciate broadway can't stand or or like like the touristy ones 
[01:27:00]  like i saw the lion king well broadway in and of itself is pretty touristy if you're  well i know but that's just it you go see like what jimmy what show did you see  i saw i've seen two i saw the odd couple because i tried rob bartlett of course that was the last  show i saw a couple yep and i also went and saw uh glengarry glenn ross see glengarry glenn ross that's  one of those that like a tourist won't go see glengarry glenn ross yeah i think so yeah i think so  because uh when we went it was alan alan uh alan alde alan alde we have schreiber uh who also tom 
[01:27:30]  wolpat was in a jeffrey tamber right i mean it was a really good cast but like cats that was another one  it was it was on broadway for years and years and years and years and all you got there were tourists  there wasn't any self-respecting broadway faggot that actually appreciated that uh maybe a year  after it it had run i don't know i think the snooty ones are going to the off broadway or the  off of broadway is that where it is now i don't know for a fact yes you do shut up you do where 
[01:28:00]  all your normal friends that you'd bump into they're the ones that are still around well usually they're  where are they how many shows are we actually discussing the tony awards i think we should be  we should be a better show at bringing in a different groups of people i think because one  of our friends was nominated and performed that we should talk about it but i i first want to get to  the bottom of this uh email that i had gotten yesterday that was written as i was leaving a  theater enraged yesterday because oh engorged yes enraged uh you you had gone to see what three days of

[01:29:00]  what's the one a gay husband who got one um uh why that play you know if i had to guess she wants  to see it because for the same reason everybody else that was there wanted to see it massive name  recognition and star power which is the only reason i could think that that theater was full yesterday  i heard it was awful it stunk it stunk i wouldn't know why did it suck i don't i didn't understand what  it was about uh her you know i i don't i can't judge acting but i know i didn't like hers so it was 
[01:29:30]  how was the set it was one set one set just one set so you don't you can't even appreciate the set  one set for the whole play it's this boring you know not very interesting story of uh three you know  three kids that are trying to figure out what happened to their father who just passed away or  what his life was like and they're going through an old journal oh boring that was only funny on  seinfeld when they found the letters that were in the burnt cabin fell asleep twice wait what's it 
[01:30:00]  called three days of rain in my acting class they were doing something that sounds familiar they all  looking at like a picture book yeah like not uh a journal of like uh jimmy knows about them i don't  know if it's the same one they're doing in my acting sketchbooks and like a picture book of of stuff  their their father had drawn is there one girl complaining that she didn't have enough like  jewels on her costume when she was a kid not that i remember but i didn't steve was complaining about  that oh yeah let's let's go to talon the trucker he got like elvis in 1977 good morning everybody

[01:31:00]  to reply to everybody i go how could you possibly fall asleep when and then i just put insert gay  reference here you write the joke your mouth is full yeah i send these things out as sort of a  preventative measure because i don't want you guys to waste two hours of your life you don't have  to worry oh like any of us we're gonna go see that play look you you guys you know you guys have  girlfriends maybe they're gonna want to see a julia roberts there was no no no there is no way we'd go  see something cool uh there was no way i would be dragged out to see a julia roberts broadway show

[01:32:30]  play i think so is it a musical not only does steve know it's a play he knows probably the plot no i  don't know why you tell everyone what the light in the piazza is all about no i don't i uh i don't know  what it's about but i know it's a play i never like i took my mama and my sister your mama and uh and  lindsey uh to light in the piazza yes for my mom's 70th birthday that's fine that's you know that's  she enjoyed it that's fine why is that okay is it a musical because you're taking your mom yeah you 
[01:33:00]  know it's a birthday you gotta whatever oh okay so i take my wife for her birthday and it's queer  here's the difference if that was a one-time occurrence it's cool because ope never goes to  plays like that's the thing he's just doing for his mom but you use it as an excuse i bet he suggested  it she's like i have my birthday's coming up but you want to go see the julia roberts play  certainly let's go it'll be fun how many plays have you seen in the last year uh musicals all that  crap i think two in the past 12 months too no way yeah she goes all the time she goes with my mother

[01:39:30]  and I said,  Nathan, how is it  that you could get on stage  and do...  I didn't get past that point  and then guise, guise, guise  all over my face  because I just love the...  Oh, where's my beep?  Find my beep, you faggot.  I'm so ill-prepared.  So I'll just do this again.  You can't dare...  My face is all wet. 
[01:40:00]  Okay, hold on.  Oh, Jesus, it's upside down.  I'm so ill-prepared.  I'm so ill-prepared.  I'm so ill-prepared.  Dig in the closet, queen.  I love the...  I just love it.  I can't get enough man...  Pickery dickery duck.  I just love man...  Oh, the Tonys? 
[01:40:30]  These days, they were great.  You liked the Tonys.  Fantastic.  Fabulous.  Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.  I'm Dice and I love man...  Oh!  I'm a big fan of Rent.  You like the Rent?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I like that story.  Why did you like it?  A bunch of... 
[01:41:00]  Because it's young men with big...  And I just love man...  Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet eating.  A curds and whey.  Along came a spider and sat down beside her.  He said, hey, bitch.  Sorry, a guy just walked up to me.  I couldn't resist his...  You couldn't finish your rhyme there. 
[01:41:30]  I couldn't think anything gay to put in there.  I know.  I see how your mind works.  I'm soaked.  I was waiting.  Trust me.  I'm soaked!  Very nice.  Andrew Dice gay.  Enjoyed the Tonys.  Andrew Dice gay.  Scott in Pennsylvania.  Very annoyed with us.  Scott, what's up?  Scott.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, can you hear me?  Yes, we can, Scott.  Go.  Okay, hey.  I know what you guys were saying about Broadway and just being flaming. 
[01:42:00]  And, you know, yes, you have Rent.  And you have other plays that have been on there.  Like, the most fabulous story ever told.  Right.  Which actually had anal sex in it.  And my school actually did that.  I'm surprised they got away with that.  Scott, could you please make your point?  We've spent 15 minutes on the Tonys.  We should have spent two.  Actually, thank God we got an appearance from Andrew Dice gay out of it, but still.  What is it, Scott?  Let's go, Scott. 
[01:42:30]  That old theater is not gay.  Really?  You're right.  You're right.  What are you saying?  You're a theater major.  Tonys aren't gay.  Not old ladies are gay.  Yes, some have to do with that prospect.  Dude, I'm sure, you know.  There's a couple straight guys involved.  I don't mind a play every once in a while.  But I'm not going to sit down and watch the Tony Awards.  Yeah, you're not going to watch the Tonys.  I am banging a female theater major.  I really don't want to be called a, you know, faggot or whatever. 
[01:43:00]  Did we call you a faggot, sir?  Or a gay gentleman?  Dude, you can't.  We're just, you little mole.  We're just kidding around.  There's no reason to get, like, get your little panties in a bunch.  And I hear a little gay in your voice, to be honest with you.  Yeah, you sound like you're still searching.  Yeah, just a little gay.  You got a little of the gay in your voice.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Absolutely not.  All right.  How old are you, though?  I am 20.  All right, don't worry. 
[01:43:30]  There's plenty of time.  Yeah, you're still confused.  You will.  There's plenty of time.  Do you wonder why, whenever you're in bed, you just struggle?  I don't know.  I must be on medication.  It's happening again.  It's not working.  All right, Scott.  So you made your point.  I'm a theater major.  Tonys aren't gay.  That's right.  You're a man's man.  All right?  All right.  Hey, I love your show.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Scott.  Bye.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Thank you, miss. 
[01:44:00]  Grinded it in.  Let's say hi to Kyle on Long Island.  Kyle.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  First of all, I've got to say I love you guys.  It's great to hear you again.  Thank you, Kyle.  All right.  I've got to let Jimmy know I loved Lucky Louie last night.  I really wish I could see the rest of it right away.  I can't wait.  Thanks, man.  That's about it.  I'm punching out.  I love the show.  And actually, where do you guys film it?  What?  Where do you guys film the show?  Film what show?  To see it. 
[01:44:30]  Lucky Louie.  Lucky Louie shot at L.A. Hollywood Center Studios.  I'm not sure where we'll be doing the other ones if they pick it up.  I don't know.  Well, if I can, I'll buy tickets to go fly out there to see it.  I'll let you know that.  You're a doll, sir.  Thank you.  Bring the Tony's guy with you.  Thank you.  All right?  I was all disappointed at Lucky Louie last night.  Why, sweetie?  Because I'd seen it already.  Yeah, it didn't change much.  I was all excited that it was on.  And then I'm like, but we saw it.  But we saw it already.  I should have waited.  I've seen that pilot so many times. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Because the audience had no idea who any of us were.  So they would show that every show just so people had an idea.  And I was like, ugh.  You guys have seen it, I mean, probably 50 times.  We got time.  David Lee Roth was on the WB11 Morning News here in New York City.  Ooh.  What could he possibly be talking about?  Well, he's got that bluegrass Van Halen thing he's doing.  Oh, it's wonderful.  With the fiddle players.  Oh, I mean, it sucks.  What's the album called again?  Yeah.  Strumming with the Devil.  Strumming with the Devil.  And I think he only sings two of the songs, right? 
[01:45:30]  Sinks two of the songs country style.  That's it?  A lot of fiddles and such.  It's called.  He only sings two and then the rest is instrumental?  Strumming with the Devil, the southern side of Van Halen,  and a tribute featuring David Lee Roth.  Way to go to work.  It's awful.  It's bluegrass Van Halen song.  I cut my back against the record machine.  And David Lee Roth has no choice because the boys still hate him.  Yeah.  That's what's going on with that.  So he's plugging that? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, all over the place.  He was on Leno last week, and now he's on the WB11 Morning News.  And here's some audio.  Please welcome the one, the only, David Lee Roth.  Yeah.  Good morning.  It's so good to have you.  It's good to be here.  It's great, you know, it's great to see you.  And, you know, some time has passed since the whole thing happened with, you know, 92.3.  Oh, so you read about when I was king of radio for 90 days?  Yeah, 90 whole days.  So what happened, really?  I mean, were you fired while you were on the air?  No.  What happened is I think they finally finished Opie and Anthony's contract, which took about 
[01:46:30]  a year for them to put together.  A year.  Wrong!  He's playing this one up in every interview.  Wrong!  That we were, like, we were in negotiation for the entire time.  Like, they hired him knowing that we were coming in.  They don't pay you that kind of money.  Right.  Look, the guys around here, they really believed in David Lee Roth.  They really thought it was going to work.  And they also realized very early on that was a huge mistake. 
[01:47:00]  But they really believed in him.  They paid him a lot of money to do morning radio.  They thought that he could get the job done.  We did try to get this gig 18, 19 months ago, and they weren't ready to talk.  No.  They were still scared of us.  They were scared.  So, yes, that part is true.  We did try to do this deal a long time ago, but they weren't listening.  He's trying to just save a little face.  Yeah.  As long as he doesn't throw the show under the bus.  He's just seeing this little face.  He's trying it to spin.  Yeah, we'll save it. 
[01:47:30]  It took about a year for them to put together.  A year.  And neatly, it dovetailed one and the other.  It's no coincidence that the day I left is the day they just happened to be there.  Wow.  So, when did you find out about it, though?  Like, when they were on the air?  Oh, word around the campfire happened before even the first day.  I knew that I had been most likely to be voted.  I was voted most likely to create a diversion, I think, as they readied the guys.  Opie and Anthony are heavy lifters.  Yeah.  And they've been in town quite a while, all right. 
[01:48:00]  Oh.  All right.  Thanks for the compliment there, Diamond Dave.  But now we can't bash him anymore?  What happened?  He's not bashing the show.  What happened?  It's an embarrassing thing to get canned that fast.  You got to see it a little.  We're starting to hear the stories, though, man.  He used to come in, what was it, with, like, a balance thing?  A leveler.  A leveler.  I mean, a level, and look at all his pictures that he had hung up in the hall.  And make sure they were level?  And make sure they were level.  Is this true, Ben?  At 5.30, he would check to make sure the pictures are hung up straight.  Wow.  Maybe he should have been, like, reading a paper. 
[01:48:30]  Radio is filled with just problems.  Yeah.  With problemed childs.  The palm trees is the best.  When he brought all the palm trees in, he brought in a bunch of palm trees.  Yeah, he brought in these, like, thousands of dollars.  They cost these palm trees and lined the hallways with them.  Right.  And put, like, sand down.  He wanted, like, this atmosphere of, we're on the beach or something.  And then one day he just came in, freaked out, and took them out.  He got all mad, and he took all his palm trees home.  Palm trees home.  He'd have big pictures put up that meant nothing to this station. 
[01:49:00]  Jazz photos up, and he wanted to feel like the California girls video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's still living, the California girls video.  My God.  Poor Dave.  And then he had the level, and he was making sure his pictures were all level every morning.  Pictures gotta be level.  All right, here's some more audio from his interview this morning.  Do you like them?  I mean, do you listen to them?  I'm not familiar.  Or are you kind of, like, boycotting the station together?  No, no, no, not at all.  Well, frankly, if I'm not working morning radio, then 5 o'clock in the morning is usually when  I'm making cab fare for the stripper. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  He's wild.  Absolutely.  There's deals on the table coming from the satellite or whatever.  But I sing for dinner.  That's what I'll always do, and anything else that I do.  Occasionally, you'll see me acting on the TV or the movies.  You'll see something.  I mean, it's nice to be so versatile.  A little left-hand turn, you know, it's a little salt in the rice.  Yeah, awesome.  A little, his analogies stink.  I just don't get them.  Someone's got to call him out on his analogies.  A little salt in the rice?  Sure, you have rice. 
[01:50:00]  Well, what does rice mean?  Sometimes you sprinkle carbs.  But you put soy sauce on rice.  It's salty, but it works good with-  I like butter on my rice from time to time.  No, little soy sauce.  Oh, ew.  Ew.  It's, well, ew?  Yeah.  It's like, it goes with rice.  Butter is the number one answer.  Butter and rice.  You're insane.  Butter is-  I'm insane?  Take a survey.  You're talking like a poor person.  If this was Family Feud, butter would be the number one answer.  No, when you-  Soy sauce.  Soy sauce would be that weird answer.  Soy sauce is salt. 
[01:50:30]  Guys, I have an idea for a bit.  Call in with your favorite rice toppings.  Oh, wow.  We could go the rest of the show.  We're going to have to agree to disagree.  LOL.  Give me those ribs.  No.  Agree to disagree.  Someone's got to calm out on those analogies with myself.  If you enjoyed that argument, I hope you put AZT on your rice or some gasoline.  Word around the campfire.  Mm-hmm.  Fair enough, sir.  All right.  We'll break.  This is more audio.  I don't know if it's worth playing.  We'll decide during the break. 
[01:51:00]  Campfires bring back awful memories of girls I liked that didn't like me.  Nothing lonelier than a campfire.  Why?  You tell the ghost stories?  That's right.  The smell of wood burning and the girl you had the crush on who was there.  With some other guy.  That feeling in the pit of your stomach when you see her, you say hi, and then you realize  she's not announced that she's with this other guy, but yet you know.  I'm always the last to know.  All fat-faced with his hopes up.  Oh, how old?  Seven through 37. 
[01:51:30]  At the campfire.  That's so true, though.  You're sitting around that stupid campfire or big party atmosphere where there's some  maybe adults somewhere and the kids are all hanging out somewhere and you got some crush  on this girl and just has no interest.  I had a crush on a girl that did the Gold Digger jean commercials.  Remember years ago, Gold Diggers?  I don't know.  That's all I remember.  Really?  Gold Digger jeans.  It was a little blonde girl dancing when I was like 13.  I used to pretend that we were in a relationship. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, I thought you knew her.  No, I used to watch the TV.  Oh, just through the TV?  I pretend that we were in a relationship.  I pretend.  But all you knew of her was her dancing to the Gold Digger song.  So how did the relationship turn out?  I just wished.  Just wished.  She liked little Jimmy Norton for who he was.  Like in every situation, she's just dancing in her Gold Digger pants.  You're like sitting in front of the TV in your house together and she's just because all  you know of her is that one thing. 
[01:52:30]  I always thought like if they just got to know me, but the women that I've liked like  in the last couple of years really liked that have gotten that like who really know me  want nothing to do with me.  Like I keep thinking like there's this jewel in the rough buried.  It's crap.  And there's just nothing.  No.  It's tranny stories.  There's no jewel in the rough.  It's nonsense.  We'll continue with that after the break.  We feel sorry for you, Jimmy.  Poor bastard.  No, I'm a happy boy.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  That's right.  It is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:53:00]  It's a Monday with little Jimmy Norton.  Little Jimmy Norton.  We're going to discuss our feelings for each other.  I said I did say that during the break.  We're going to switch gears, guys, and we're going to spend the next 10 minutes talking  about how we feel about each other.  Oh, that's good.  You know, these idiots have actually been instant feedback.  They're rice toppings.  They might be in on the gag.  Yeah, I think this one.  I like garlic salt on my rice.  Tee hee hee. 
[01:53:30]  It says.  Someone's explaining that you need salt.  No, you need rice in the salt shaker.  Yeah, you know how sometimes you put rice in the salt shaker to keep it from clumping?  Is that what that's for?  Yeah.  I didn't know what that was for, but I wondered.  My friends and I would talk.  It's annoying, and it skeeves me out.  Tee hee.  All right, listen.  We got a brand new shame, shame, shame.  Oh, what are these?  We love the shame, shame, shame segments.  Busy body, C-blocking idiots doing now.  I'm sure in your fine city it's called something else, but it's the do-gooder reporter. 
[01:54:00]  It's your, yeah, a reporter that goes out and takes care of someone's problem.  It's nosy Ned.  Nosey Ned.  Alice came to her because, it came to us because she didn't get a refund where she was due one.  Right.  It was $5.  It doesn't sound like much, but to her it means, so we went to the store, shoved a camera in this guy's face.  That's just trying to make a damn living.  He's just trying to make a living.  We don't know who the a-hole in this situation is, but she called us first. 
[01:54:30]  I'm waiting for the first guy to haul off and punch the reporter square in the middle of the forehead.  I've seen it a couple of times.  Not on the shame, shame, shame things, but where the camera gets a little too close to someone's face and they just kind of pop.  Well, we got this do-gooder here in New York City, Arnold Diaz.  Arnold Diaz, and he tries to dress like an old Sam Slade thing or one of those.  He wears a long trench coat.  An old gumshoe.  Yeah, like an old gumshoe.  I'm investigating.  I'm an investigative reporter. 
[01:55:00]  Are you?  Just trying to help out the little man.  Really?  What's his beef?  What a killjoy he is.  You know he wanted to do like the CBS Evening News.  He realized he failed miserably in his broadcasting career.  Now he has to go after people that are parking in handicapped spots.  When every time you're on screen, it was prefaced with a shaking finger graphic, shame, shame, you know you didn't quite make it as far as you wanted to in broadcasting. 
[01:55:30]  The big shame, shame, shame.  Isn't it funny if he just snapped and only did a segment about interracial couples?  Shame, shame.  Yeah, start crying, parents.  Starts bringing to the table some just awful things for his shame, shame, shame, sake.  People that marry out of their faith, right?  A Jewish girl marrying a Catholic boy, shame on you.  Why did you decide to marry him?  Leave us alone.  We're happy. 
[01:56:00]  We're in love.  We're in love, boy.  Well, he's going after a handicapped parking.  Ah.  Violators.  First of all, we haven't even talked about it lately.  There's way too many handicapped spots.  I've had it.  I mean, give us a couple in the front row, please, as a luxury.  Sometimes I'm just running in.  I'm just running in.  And there's no parking anywhere.  It's right up there.  It's close.  It's convenient. 
[01:56:30]  Right.  And there's no handicapped person in sight.  There's ten more spots.  Right.  I'm sure an army of handicapped aren't going to pull up.  Let me park.  And we're curing most of these diseases.  So start taking away the handicapped parking.  Right.  Polio.  Stop it.  Who's got that anymore?  Just wait for two minutes.  I'll be right out.  Turn up feet.  And it's all a scam.  Who hasn't got the placard?  Who hasn't got one of those?  Something hanging from your rear view.  Who hasn't got one of those for the weekend?  And then you park in the handicapped parking.  Of course. 
[01:57:00]  And then you limp a little just in case someone's looking.  D, I get out with a skip and a jump and I run into the store.  There's too many handicapped spots.  I'm going to be quick.  I'll even jump around singing, my legs work fine.  Hooray.  Hooray.  And I'll click my heels like Gene Kelly.  I would never stay in there for any length of time.  All right.  We're running out of show on this first half.  Damn it.  First half of the Open Anthem show, whatever.  So it's Shame, Shame, Shame with Arnold Diaz. 
[01:57:30]  Nosy Ned.  Doing the whole thing on handicapped parking.  Shame, shame, shame.  Of course.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  As soon as this driver spotted our Fox 5 camera, he rushed over to move his van.  And for good reason.  It's an official New York state vehicle, illegally parked in a spot reserved for the handicapped.  You parked in a handicapped spot.  Listen, I was here six in the morning.  It's not for you. 
[01:58:00]  It's for disabled people.  I know that.  You know that, right?  So why are you parking there?  The driver's part of the construction crew working on the state-run OTV parlor in this  Whitestone Queen shopping center.  The supervisor's truck telling us this was an isolated incident.  It's one day.  It's not one day.  We knew it wasn't one day because this man, Bill Danielson, know why?  Because they've been staking out a dumb handicapped parking spot for a month.  That guy's working his ass off on a real job, a construction site, and he just wants 
[01:58:30]  to maybe park a little closer so he doesn't have to haul his tools maybe across a parking  lot, and this nosy Ned, if I may use Opie's wonderful name for him.  Well, that's a thing I got from Jimmy and Jim Florentine.  They love the...  Go ahead, whatever.  He's hassling him.  I swear to you, if a camera pulled up to me, I would laugh.  I'd be like, are you kidding me?  Yes.  Yeah, I'm parked here.  Now what?  Not only would I laugh, but I would take my perfectly good working legs and I'd put them  in front of the camera and go, get a gander at these, boys. 
[01:59:00]  Look at these bowling pin calves.  I can walk, walk, walk till the cows come home.  Yeah, someone is pointing out, Pat from Menachie, now they have reserved spots for people with  children as well.  That's true.  And pregnant moms, some of the stores do.  It's one day.  No, it's not one day.  It's not.  We knew it wasn't.  It's not one day.  You hear me?  Got all nasty.  Listen to nosy Ned.  You're lying to me, sir.  Oh, the buzzkill that is Arnold Diaz. 
[01:59:30]  What a douche.  No, it's not one day.  We knew it wasn't one day because this man, Bill Danielson, has been taking pictures for  the past two weeks of other state vans in the handicapped spots.  I did take photographs and I've been seen taking photographs.  Check his computer.  And he continued to do it.  That there's other photographs on it.  You hear that?  And I'll continue to do it.  I'll continue.  I'm making a difference.  Who is that guy?  I hate that I live in the same world as an Arnold Diaz and that ass with his stupid  Polaroid camera. 
[02:00:00]  Taking pictures.  I've been taking pictures.  And I'll continue to do so.  I'm going to continue.  This is my thing.  To hopefully have.  See him come home.  Honey, I got three more today.  Look.  Yeah.  Big whoop.  Look at him.  Look at the pictures.  This is clearly more handicapped.  He's parking here and walking away.  He doesn't have the proper placard.  Oh.  Just trying to make a difference in this world.  You're not.  Polaroid guy.  You're not, cameraman.  He thinks he's taking the Vietnamese girl burning running down the street photo. 
[02:00:30]  No, you're not.  You're not making a difference.  You're a ball buster.  A lot of people thought that we came up with a shame, shame, shame jingle.  We did.  They can't believe it's actually what they use during the news segment.  Oh, no, people.  They really do use it.  Have some pride.  Here's a clip called Man on a Mission.  Bill Danielson is a man on a mission, trying to get people to stop parking illegally in  handicapped spaces.  It's disabled people. 
[02:01:00]  Don't shake your head.  You have no right to do this.  It's a major problem in New York City, he says, because...  The city itself does not enforce the laws that the state has already passed.  The law is clear.  If you don't have a special handicap permit or license plate, you're subject to a $180  ticket, plus your car can be towed.  But Bill says many city traffic agents are reluctant to enforce the law.  And they're only looking at people that have expired meters.  God, get a job, dude. 
[02:01:30]  Get a job.  You know what I'd like to do to Bill Danielson?  I'd take a bat and put a nail through it and swing it right at his chin.  Big gutter spike.  Right through his head.  The old snake plissken cure.  Give him the old snake.  Good old Bill is going to be camped out at the express line at the grocery store next.  That's 11 items.  You got 11 items.  I took pictures.  It's 10 or less.  Don't you see the sign?  It's 10 or less. 
[02:02:00]  Just punch.  He was the guy.  Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.  That was polarized.  Punched in the face every day at school.  Empty nothing.  And rightly so.  How human he is.  You know what's worse than people that just park in handicapped spaces like that?  When you see people that have the permits that are allowed that are just fat people.  How many fat?  Have you seen this?  Oh, yeah.  Have you seen this?  With the little rascal scooters.  And they're handicapped.  And they park in the spaces because they're fat. 
[02:02:30]  You know why?  Because they didn't walk from one end of the parking lot to the other.  Let's stop going against nature.  It's survival of the fittest.  I can't help it.  I eat salad.  I just get fat.  It's survival of the fittest.  I get fat.  Do you?  No one in history has ever eaten salads and gotten fat.  No.  Never.  It's because of the croutons.  It's my thyroid.  I gotta eat salad, but make sure you give me an extra scoop of croutons.  What, did you eat it?  Deep fried croutons.  And I'd also like some creamy dressing. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  I get my salad at the McDonald's.  We get the salad with the fried croutons and the dressing.  Yeah, they did reports on that.  That has more calories than a Big Mac.  Yeah, they said that.  All right, let's...  I'm having comfort food.  Let's go to the next clip here.  This do-gooder has gotten smacked for his effort.  Oh, yes.  So, with his dog Chase on his lap, Bill patrols the shopping centers and municipal parks.  He's just walking around patrolling.  What a douche.  Loser.  Can someone get a picture of this guy?  Loser.  I gotta see him. 
[02:03:30]  Where's the report?  So, with his dog Chase on his lap, Bill patrols the shopping centers and municipal parking  lots around his queen's home.  Armed only with a camera and a stack of flyers that say, parking here for just a minute is  60 seconds too long.  He gets this guy who has no handicap permit or plate, a flyer, and a piece of his mind.  I'm here chasing after people like yourself who keep illegally parking in handicapped parking  spaces.  This is my crusade.  And here you are sitting, talking when there's plenty of other parking spaces. 
[02:04:00]  The man mumbles an apology.  That was my mistake and, uh...  You see, it's a common mistake.  Bill says not all of his encounters go so smoothly.  I get the bird.  I get smacked.  I've been threatened to mind my own business.  If I don't, I'm going to be sorry.  Nice.  I love it.  I would only like this segment if the shame on you was on him for being a busybody.  Shame on you for having nothing else in your life, you empty nobody.  See, then I'd have respect for Arnold Diaz.  He does this whole piece and at the end, no, the shame is on you. 
[02:04:30]  Mind your own beeswax.  That's right.  You neighborhood nudge.  He's a nudge.  You know he is hated throughout the neighborhood.  And he should be.  All right, let's go to the next clip.  You know what?  Let's find out where he is and someone go there and park.  Absolutely.  We got to get the pests involved.  Where is this joint?  There should be someone that can think quick on their feet, like right when they accuse  somebody.  Hey, you're parking there.  You just turn around and go, I forgot my permit at home.  And just like fall out of your truck and roll through the parking lot. 
[02:05:00]  We're running out of show, so let's get to the next clip.  Real fast here.  In this municipal lot in Flushing, Bill spots another violator.  The driver isn't around, so he painfully hobbles out of his scooter to slap a flyer  on the windshield.  Then he sees a traffic agent and asks him to come ticket the car.  But the agent hesitates.  He's making a phone call.  And to see, what should he do?  I'm very offended by it.  I'm very angry at this point right now.  This is the same nonsense that happened on this past Saturday. 
[02:05:30]  How did the Yankees hold up this weekend, Mikey?  Bill took these pictures a few days earlier of another agent who he says ignored his pleas  to ticket a car illegally parked in a handicapped spot.  But this time, this agent does eventually issue the summons.  Yes, but he was goaded into doing it.  Without you here, he would not have given that ticket.  Oh, let's just tie Bill down and take a hammer to his kneecaps.  That's right.  And I'll tell you one thing.  Obviously, he's handicapped, I guess.  He's on a scooter.  Yeah.  Rocking around the parking lot.  Oh, would that be funny if somebody accidentally backed over him as he was rumbling through 
[02:06:00]  the parking lot?  Couldn't get out of the way fast enough because his stupid knee, leg, polio problems, whatever  he has, hopefully.  And I like Bill.  If he's screwing over ticket agents, traffic agents, I like that, though, because they're  scum.  Someone's asking, where's Fat Nick when you need him?  Exactly.  He was here stealing scooters.  All right, we only got a minute left.  I got to spend the whole weekend photographing people that were parked in a handicapped space  in there, Mikey. 
[02:06:30]  Back at the Mad Dog Show on the van.  We got one more clip.  We got to get out of here.  Look at this.  In the same lot where we caught the state vehicle in the handicapped space, we saw a  New York City Parks Department truck doing the same thing.  Oh, boy.  New York City Parks Department.  You see this?  This Bill guy.  He says, parking here for just 60 seconds is too long.  You should not be here.  And look, so why are you sitting here?  Did anyone else see the spot, Bill?  You're still in the parking space.  You shouldn't be here.  You're fucking here.  It has nothing to do with me parking here.  It has everything to do with you're breaking the law. 
[02:07:00]  You're from the city government.  I mean, you should be setting a better example.  So into our Fox 5 Hall of Shame, we induct all those drivers, city and state vehicles  included, illegally parking in spaces reserved for the handicapped.  Shame, shame, shame.  Yeah.  Shame, shame, shame on all of you.  I didn't see the video, but it's very obvious that Bill's got some problems of his own, and  that's why these guys have to just sit there and take it instead of yelling and screaming 
[02:07:30]  back at him.  They should have shown somebody yelling at him.  Oh, just shut up, cripple.  Yeah.  Just shut up, cripple.  I'm just trying to make a living like you.  Get some nice 1800s terminology on him.  Shut up before I whip your legs like in dirty, rotten scoundrels.  Then we'll see.  All right, guys, that's it.  All righty.  It's too bad we got into that late.  We could have really had fun with that, but shame on you.  Yeah, we'll continue the Opie and Anthony show on XM.  We're going to do the walk in a few minutes, so if you're not going to join us, thanks  for checking us out. 
[02:08:00]  We greatly appreciate it, and we'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?  All right.  Opie and Anthony XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Right on, man.  We're outside for EFM here in New York City.  Yeah.  It's kind of a cold morning, but it's going to get up to, what, 80 today, eh?  Right, good.  Yeah, see, I was smart.  I brought on my jacket.  We got a tour bus right outside here.  Yeah.  What the hell's going on?  Black Label Society tour bus? 
[02:08:30]  That's pretty cool.  Where's that?  Oh, nice.  Radiohead, man.  Did you what?  I just dropped off Radiohead here in the city going back to Nashville.  Oh, wow.  Radiohead arrived in this?  Yeah, I just dropped him off, left Montreal last night, what, 2 a.m.?  Just kicked him off the hotel about an hour ago.  Been kicking around, waiting to do this.  Were you a driver?  Yeah, stop by, say hello to you guys.  Listen to you guys all the time.  Man, you log a lot of miles, huh?  Hell yeah, nothing but miles.  You got the XM on this?  All the time.  Never sleep with. 
[02:09:00]  So who, like, is this just for a couple of bands?  This bus, we built this bus for Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Then we had Zach Wilde on it.  Then Keith Urban, I just did Radiohead.  Ed, fixing to pick up Phil Lesh, Grateful Dead.  Yeah, right on.  Wow.  Any good Radiohead stories?  No, those guys are real cupcakes, real mellow.  No trouble at all.  Cupcakes.  Didn't even mess up the bus.  I was cleaning up just to have something to do.  Can we check it out?  Absolutely.  What did Jimmy do, sniff the seats?  You faggot.  Hey, how does Zach, when he's on here, I hear he drinks a little excessively. 
[02:09:30]  Zach, if he doesn't have a beer in his hand, then he's probably sleeping.  He's a real alky, I love him.  Zach is a pure individual, he's a great guy.  Nice in there.  Hey, there's a Radiohead duty in the toilet still.  No, it's Jimmy's.  Oh, that was Jimmy's?  Yeah, I just, I christened the bathroom.  How do people sleep in those little bunks, man?  That would fucking drive me.  Are they small?  Yeah, look at that.  Nah, I gotta take a look now.  Hey, ask the bus driver.  I'm not out there with you, I'm on the bus.  Yeah, I'm in here now, too.  One of the guys wanted to watch Miss Congeniality or something like that? 
[02:10:00]  What's this about?  It's actually porn inside there.  They just put that on there for you guys.  Oh.  Well, okay.  Sandra Bullock movies.  Yeah, these are little, like, sleeper things.  There's a lot of them, weren't there?  Which bunk did Tom York sleep in?  You know, I don't know.  They all felt the same when I reached in and gave them a little squeezy here and there.  I couldn't tell the difference.  Yeah, let's check their pillows, see if anybody was humping pillows during the night.  I wish we had a blacklight.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  A blacklight.  All over the place. 
[02:10:30]  I would have to sleep in a bottom bunk, though.  I'd hate to be in a top bunk.  Why?  Because I piss so much, I'd hate to jump in and out.  You want to lay down, Ant?  Me and you?  Yeah, why not?  Let me see this little room back here.  Look at it.  They got a nice flat screen TV up there.  There's an oven.  You know how many beers have probably been bad things have been done back here?  What a way to travel.  The New Yorker magazine.  Where are the rock stars, though?  This is cool, man.  A little seated.  We're in a seated area.  In the back.  In the bus.  A little table.  Yeah.  And a TV and a VCR. 
[02:11:00]  This is actually a pretty cool way to go.  We got to have this guy call when he's on the road is what he's got to do, you know?  Yeah, me and this guy talk, I think, through MySpace.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's great.  Hey, why don't we...  How many, yeah, how many fucking, like, how many blowjobs back here?  Fuck, I'd give them all the time.  You want to make one more?  This is great.  All right, there's nothing going on in here.  It's nice and...  It's all cleaned out, unfortunately.  Yeah.  I'd like to be on this bus ten minutes after Zach and the band gets off.  No kidding.  Probably smells a lot different than it does now.  Wow, it's kind of...  Sleeps eight, this thing, huh? 
[02:11:30]  Kind of fresh.  You keep it nice and fresh.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the bottle of wine that hit the floor.  Dude, you got to...  Did Ben give you the hotline?  You got to call us from the road?  Anytime, man.  I'll call you guys anytime.  Yeah, call us with some of those cool stories, all right?  I usually call in with something stupid to say and you guys cut me off.  Oh, you're one of those guys.  Never mind.  I'm just kidding.  Wow, what's that little thing?  That's that little screen camera you got there.  That's for the back of the thing.  You got a camera on the back of your bus?  Yeah.  So you can back up.  Oh, there it is.  Look at that.  He's got the XM right there, the Delphi. 
[02:12:00]  Nice.  He's a good boy.  We should upgrade you.  That Delphi, I mean, it still works great, but we got even cooler things out there now.  Upgrade.  Good state, man.  All right, thanks, bro.  I appreciate it.  You too, man.  All right.  You're the best, man.  Love you.  Cool.  Thank you, man.  We'll see you later.  Keep it between the ditches, my friend.  There you go.  Drive safe.  There you go.  A tour bus.  He just dropped off Radiohead here in Manhattan.  Yeah, he was giving me Zach updates on the road, like, yeah, we're in this part of town.  We're here.  That is something. 
[02:12:30]  Very cool.  All right.  All the comforts.  Bring some broads in there.  Yeah.  Some broads after the show.  Yeah.  Hey, we're sitting back in the wheelie there.  We eat meatballs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Our walk now.  It's nippy out, so there's not much going on.  It is.  It's kind of sad.  Friday, we had, what, close to 100 fans out here with us.  Yeah.  We're sort of Jimmy Day, and today we have four.  Well, the next Jimmy Day is Friday. 
[02:13:00]  Some home people.  No, it's not.  No, it's not weekly.  No.  It's every Friday.  It's not every week.  I want it once a week.  No.  That's what I want.  All right.  I'm spiraled.  You'll get nothing.  This man is illegally parked.  Look at this lady.  She's fucking 60 years too old for that dress.  She's wearing like a little short thing.  Yeah, that is something a 22-year-old girl should be wearing.  That awful hairdo.  That dress is awful. 
[02:13:30]  What is that?  I just don't get it.  She's got little blue and red clips in her hair.  Holy shit.  You're lovely.  What a pretty girl.  I'm so ugly.  Go talk to her, please.  No.  She'll haul off and hit you.  Yeah.  She looks like the type that would hit you.  We're goofing on her, yet we are afraid of her.  See, you guys could play along at home.  Drop something.  Obviously, we should have talked to her, but we didn't.  Why?  Because we think she could kick our ass.  She's scary.  We're faggots.  Hey, sir. 
[02:14:00]  This guy in front of us in a stupid hat.  Indiana stinks.  Mr.  Cross at the green.  Not in between, sir.  Good point, Ant.  Good point.  Way to be safe.  All right.  You're safe to go.  Oh, my God.  Look at the size of this guy.  Oh, Jesus.  The guy walking the black eye?  I'm just going to give him my wallet.  I'm not even going to wait for him to ask.  Here you go, sir.  Please don't hurt me. 
[02:14:30]  Look, George Carlin.  Who is that guy?  I don't know.  It's not Carlin.  He's an actor.  Is he?  Where?  Where?  Let me ask him.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Sir, are you an actor?  What's your name?  No, he's a character.  I've seen him in many things.  He's a character actor.  I love your work, sir.  I'll find you on IMDb.  I will know who you are.  Why would he tell me his name?  I don't know, but he is an actor.  Wait a minute.  Yeah? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  What is he?  What was he in the Douchebag Chronicles?  He's been in everything.  Let me think.  He's one of those character guys.  Yeah, he's like a guy that you go, oh, that's that guy.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm late for something.  I'll never remember.  Hopefully it's a fucking AIDS test.  Asshole.  How you doing there, sir?  Mac, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Trying to remember what the frig that guy's from.  Now that's going to annoy the shit out of me all day.  Well, how are you going to find him on IMDb?  I don't know.  Bearded idiot? 
[02:15:30]  Bearded idiot.  Yeah.  I heard Carlin's doing the Tonight Show Wednesday.  You said Carlin.  Oh, yeah.  Is he?  I want to get my picture signed.  Now I'm completely distracted trying to keep that guy's face in my head.  Nice camel to the lady.  So I can, wow.  Yeah, nice cunt gap.  Sir?  I'll be amazed if you figure it out by the end of the XM show.  Because we have nothing to go on.  Yeah.  God damn it.  Bearded guys who blow off the only people that want to talk to them media-wise.  Someone should have snapped a picture of them. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  We have cameras and video fucking shit rolling every day except today.  Wow.  When we would have used it.  Sexy.  All right.  That's the end of the walk.  Fuck off.  Thanks, guys.  It's a quick walk today.  There's not much going on today.  Instead of wasting time, we'll go upstairs and continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony XM 202.  Where do people turn when they have lost everything?  When a cruel catastrophe has taken everything they loved and cared about in life?  Where do they turn when they're in despair? 
[02:16:30]  Opie and Anthony XM 202!  It's showtime, folks.  It feels good.  It's cool.  We're a brilliant broadcaster.  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  I'm ecstatic.  Very respectful.  Very nice.  There is some shenanigans going on.  It just feels right.  They're like two puzzles.  We want perfect questions.  We want some laughs.  Hey, hey.  Some thoughts being provoked and thrown back and forth.  I don't like flaky.  I like cakey.  I want to hug a cute dog.  What a fake was that?  The name of this radio show should be The Happy Idiot and The Sullen Douche. 
[02:17:00]  Two total dorks.  Am I listening to a radio show?  Two DJs and a tranny lover.  That's what this program is about, mister.  Only creeps listen to this program.  Yo, boys.  What's happening, men?  Burn your fucking radio show!  Opie.  Anyone around here ever smell my ass?  It's lovely.  Anthony.  Come on.  We're going to tell you how to get chicks.  James.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm a horribly boring person.  E-Rock.  We just kind of laugh at him.  He's getting better, but we've got to break him in still. 
[02:17:30]  He's a candidate for killing his wife when he gets married.  I love E-Rock and the console at once.  Snapple and mayo.  Your dumps must be lovely.  And featuring...  Hurricane Ben!  Ha ha ha!  Or Teeny Steve!  I think there's a degree of mental illness with everybody on the air.  Ramone, Ramone, Ramone!  Eric's breath smells like the diaper of a cancer patient.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Can I say for the record that this program sucks a fat dick?  If I got a few ideas, I could get us fired.  Please use them. 
[02:18:00]  Please use them.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  No, I haven't figured out who the fuck that guy is.  Ah.  Good afternoon.  Morning.  What is it?  Oh, it's still morning.  Hi.  Well, all right.  Here for our XM portion of the program.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning. 
[02:18:30]  Good morning!  Good morning!  Good morning!  Good morning!  Hey, PalTalk cameras, what, we get them hooked up tomorrow?  Over at...  Over at Free FM.  I'll, uh...  Turn on the...  PalTalk here.  Give me a minute, people.  Relax.  Why is it so cold in here today?  No, I am so glad I brought my jacket. 
[02:19:00]  Can we keep the door open before we get here so it's nice and warm?  No.  All right, enough of the music.  Oh, my God, enough.  Thank you.  All right.  Gotta shut it off already.  All right.  All right.  Blasting through my head.  Ow.  Ouch.  What happened in the elevator, by the way?  Jimmy...  I was so lucky this time, because in the lobby, we usually have no choice, and we all go up 
[02:19:30]  in the same elevator, and it's just uncomfortable every day.  And today, there were two elevator doors that opened up at the same time.  I waited until the last possible second.  I saw which elevator Jimmy was going in and ran for the other one.  I don't mind if there's a lot of people in there.  And they don't see me walk in with Jimmy.  So they think I'm not with him.  Then I'm fine with it, because I think it's hysterical.  And today, the door closed, and there was a girl waiting to get in the elevator. 
[02:20:00]  And then it opened back up, and she got back on, and other people started coming on.  And Jimmy's just in the back of the elevator going,  Oh, oh, oh, no.  All right, no.  All right, already.  All right, already.  Ticking the elevator wall.  And as they're pressing the buttons for their various floors, Jimmy's just going,  Oh, God.  All right.  Just the exasperated, sighing douche.  Making everyone on the elevator uncomfortable. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, look here, everybody.  Oh, the gang's all here.  There they are.  There they are.  Let me get the usual suspects up.  Makes our day a little more familiar.  Are there any girls?  Of course there are girls.  What girls are there?  We got Lil.  We got Silly Goose.  We got Happy Typing Girl.  We got some girl on, Fat Ugly Girl on Opant 2. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, wait, that's Jimmy.  Aw, I'm teasing.  So, that Shame on You thing?  Yes.  That was good, right?  Yeah.  Donald Diaz, what's wrong?  I'm not a fat, ugly girl.  No.  I am pretty.  You're a pretty girl.  Let's try to get that guy on the phone.  Let's see if we can call him.  Yeah, where is he?  Drop something, Hawk.  Where's Danny?  He was the one that got Shame on You together.  Get Danny the Queer in here. 
[02:21:30]  Let's see if we can get that guy on the phone.  Danny.  Tell him.  Does Danny still think I'm mad at him?  What do you mean?  I should play that up.  There's been enough talk behind the scenes.  Does Danny still think I'm mad at him?  Really?  For what?  Good.  Get that Green Goblin douche in here.  For, um...  They all play a gag on each other.  Where they...  If somebody leaves their email open,  they email me.  Under someone else's email.  So I guess, um...  Uh, Danny left his email open. 
[02:22:00]  And they had emailed me again.  Something like,  Hey, Anthony, I think we should hang out.  So, uh...  I had just got done typing one of my  whack bag responses,  which is just full of, like,  fuck you, asshole, cunt rag.  You know, just everything thrown in there  to tell people that they're shitheads.  And, uh, I open up my email,  and there's one from Danny,  and it's like...  And I know it's one of the other guys,  because it's like,  can we hang out and stuff?  So I just thought it would be funny  to type, fuck off. 
[02:22:30]  Because normally, I respond to these.  And it's like,  well, that sounds like a lot of fun.  Uh, we should hang out.  It's, uh, you know,  I'll suck your cock, you suck mine.  Something, you know, fun, true.  You know, whatever you want to call it.  But this time I just wrote,  fuck off, and sent it.  And from what I hear,  Danny has been, like,  nervous that I'm upset.  Well, no, because I know that usually,  like you explained,  you usually give a little more than that.  I give a little more.  Sometimes I don't want to give any more, Danny. 
[02:23:00]  So I, you know, I mean,  there's not much you can take  from just, fuck off.  So I was like,  shit, I hope he's not really pissed.  And then, and then, uh,  I made a face when you walked out  of the, uh, control room  at CBS the other day.  I made a face, like,  you kind of smiled, like,  is it a joke and stuff?  And I kind of looked at him like,  no, it's not a fucking joke.  And, uh,  I guess, uh,  you had told a couple of people  that you were concerned  that I was actually angry.  Well, I just wasn't sure  because I knew,  I knew of your mood.  I did read the posts. 
[02:23:30]  My mood?  Oh, that day.  Yeah, on the front of the post.  Yeah, so I was just like,  uh, you're probably not the best.  Never with the staff, though, Danny.  Rest is sure.  Uh, I would never get angry at something  as silly as that.  I was just thinking,  why would that be the one email  that he would get angry at?  I don't know.  It was just because usually,  like I said,  there's more to it  than just,  fuck off.  I had used up all my creativity  calling someone a fucking  cunt rag,  ass bag,  bitch,  dick,  fuck,  that I was going to buy  his mother  and fuck her up the ass. 
[02:24:00]  I was very angry that day.  By the way,  the fags are at it again  on Wack Bag.  Oh, really?  They had a whole discussion  about my paunch.  What is wrong with you guys?  I pray,  I pray it's a joke,  but I don't know.  No.  I don't know if it's a joke.  It's not.  It's just something  we used to see you  in a certain shape.  For all the faggots out there  that are bummed out  because I've lost my V  and they captured it  on a digital picture  during sort of Jimmy Day, 
[02:24:30]  if you need to know,  faggot,  the reality is  I didn't shit  for three and a half days.  I was filled with shit.  So what you're looking at  in that fucking picture  is my belly and abdomen  completely filled with shit.  Why didn't you shit  for three days?  I don't know what happened.  No good.  What happened?  I was even bitching about it  on the show  that I haven't taken a dump  in a while.  Well, it turned out to be  three to three and a half days  of my belly  and gut filled with shit.  Here it is now. 
[02:25:00]  Look,  now they're just  bitching again.  Is that all they do  on XM  is bitch?  How was your dump?  It was unbelievable.  I did a two-footer.  Two-footer.  It was so packed.  That's nothing.  You take big dumps, right?  Yeah, giant two.  See, he's saying that he doesn't shit  for three and a half days.  To me, that's perfectly normal.  No, it's not.  That's disgusting.  You should shit, honest to God.  Maybe two.  Once or twice a day.  Yeah.  Not two.  Once or twice a day.  Everyone's a little different. 
[02:25:30]  No.  It depends on what you eat  and your metabolism.  Once a day, then.  Or twice a day.  That's the difference.  Once a day would be nice,  but sometimes it could be  once every, like,  you could skip a day.  Unhealthy.  Yeah, occasionally.  But if it's a habit,  it's unhealthy.  But that's the explanation  if you need to know, faggots.  You go three and a half days.  I was filled with shit.  Lots and lots of shit.  And I hope it's a joke.  If it's a joke, whatever.  I mean, we smash each other  all the time,  but I'm reading some of these posts  going,  I think some of these guys  are really bummed  that I don't have a V. 
[02:26:00]  Hey.  What?  Oh, the dump report?  Oh, it is.  They do tell us who did it.  Oh, okay.  This one is kind of childlike.  Why don't we get into  the dump report for today?  Monday, June 12, 2006.  The year of our Lord.  Live from the Opie and Anthony  Show Studios,  The Daily Dump Report.  The Daily Dump Report.  Here it is.  At 7.04 a.m.,  I pissed on the green monster.  Caller discussing his trip  to Wrigley Field in Boston. 
[02:26:30]  And then a little side note from Al.  He was very confused.  Holy crap.  All that discussion  got through today.  See?  That's good.  I know it's good.  Very good.  When that one guy  was talking about  taking a dump in a hole  in, where was he?  Italy?  Yeah.  And then his father  had to help the...  A push stick?  Had to push the crap down  with a stick?  You know why?  I was thinking  that whole thing  was going to be chopped.  You know why?  It wasn't something  that was just 
[02:27:00]  being harped on  for the sheer purpose  of shock value.  We were having a discussion  about dads  and...  And penises.  And what we were talking about.  Yeah.  And there are certain ways  to do that  without getting in trouble.  We're getting dumped out.  We gotta go to Tom  and make it fun  and entertaining.  7.17 a.m.  We both peed  at the same time.  Norton,  during a lengthy discussion  about seeing your father's junk 
[02:27:30]  when you're a kid.  I can't say peed.  Yeah, peed.  Any kind of bodily fluid reference  in that way.  You know,  pee, piss, piss.  They don't like any word  that starts with pee.  It's amazing.  I know, it's ridiculous.  I gotta be honest.  I see something going on  here in the studio.  I'm not bummed  by any of these dumps.  I'm bummed by one  that I don't think  should have been.  But I think  we got some people  behind the scenes  that really know this shit  and we're gonna lose some. 
[02:28:00]  I know that,  but I pissed on the green monster  I understand.  Um,  drops trow,  squats,  drops a log.  I can understand  drops a log.  I'm just saying that.  I think that's what got it.  Dumped.  The next one,  742,  drops trow  and squats down,  drops a log.  Drops a log  and drops a log again.  Call of which discussion  of the bathroom,  hole in the ground  while the father was watching,  blah, blah, blah.  It was the dropping  the log thing.  I think it was a little  too familiar territory  where people can decipher  what you're talking about. 
[02:28:30]  And 820,  which actually  had anal sex in it.  Call it discussing  a Broadway play  that his high school  put on.  Wow.  I didn't even realize that.  I wasn't really listening.  Wow.  Sounds like a hot little play.  And Bravo to Anthony  being able to do  Andrew Dice Gay  with the sounds  and everything  with his water there.  My beep button  in the water.  I was wondering  what they were going  to do with that. 
[02:29:00]  Are we trying to get  this guy on the phone?  Phil?  Dumped today.  That's all.  Very good.  Not bad.  Very good job.  Yeah, I don't mind  the dumping.  Sometimes there's certain things  I think it's just  a little bit panic.  Good job, men.  I don't think  that was bad at all.  Nah.  We understand  the game we've got to play.  They're just uber paranoid.  Yeah.  They are.  And with the fines  going up and everything,  I can understand it.  And I have no problem.  A lot of people  when we first came  to Satellite  were wondering  if it was going  to be as fun  because we don't have  the restrictions 
[02:29:30]  how we were going  to get around things.  And I realized  I did kind of miss that.  And it is fun  to have an adult discussion  in a way where  you have to kind of  weave yourself  around the discussion.  And then we come here  and it's back to  business as fucking usual.  Here's the beauty  of XM, by the way.  Jim Norton is starring  in Lucky Louie on HBO.  And everyone saw it  and he's getting  really good reviews  from all the listeners  and stuff.  We couldn't play 
[02:30:00]  Jimmy's scene  on regular radio.  No.  We can play it here, though.  We can play it here.  See, we're not bitching.  And again,  there's people  that were saying  that all we do  and that's what  was pissing me off.  A lot of people  I responded to  on the message board  over the weekend  were saying,  oh, Anthony's  all pissed off again  because they're bitching.  It's like, no,  I understand  if you don't enjoy  the bitching part  that you might not  like listening to that.  But don't write  all we do  now on XM  is bitch 
[02:30:30]  because that isn't  the truth of the matter.  We bitched for two days.  We did.  Two days straight.  And we got something done.  There was a lot of bitching  because we wanted  something done  and it got done.  We're on a commercial now  for XM,  which is great.  A couple of other issues  were resolved.  And these people  that complain  about us bitching  don't really get  the full picture.  They don't understand  how smart we really are.  Right.  We know XM  doesn't want to sit there  and listen to us bitch  day in and day out.  So what do they do?  They shut us up  by making us part 
[02:31:00]  of the national TV spot.  That's exactly  what happened.  Exactly.  Our bitching  got us on that  national TV spot.  They were not going  to include us  in that spot.  No.  I'm sorry.  They weren't.  And if Eric Logan  calls right now  and says,  oh, we definitely were,  I would have to call him  out and say,  no way, Eric.  There was somebody  that said  they were bitching  about XM  and they should  give them more respect  because  when they first  got back on the air,  no one wanted 
[02:31:30]  to touch him  except for XM  and why are they  complaining  and something  and this is something  that really got me.  He goes,  something that Anthony  wrote was,  they're standing  in the way  of our careers  and when I said that,  the stupid fuck  on the message board  didn't realize  because I didn't say it  because you're  an uninformed asshole  is that I'm talking  about the fucking lawyers,  you idiot.  Lawyers that are arguing  back and forth  that are keeping,  like holding us back  from furthering our career  because of legal bullshit. 
[02:32:00]  Not XM,  you stupid ass,  but this guy  knows everything,  they all know everything  that's going on  behind the scenes  and so willing  to comment on it  and make accusations  based on that  and stuff.  You don't know shit,  so shut the fuck up  and that's what  I pretty much  write back  to everybody now.  And what is he trying  to say,  that we were  a charity case?  Yeah,  that we were  a charity case  and we wouldn't have,  well,  their big topic was,  would we have gotten  the CBS deal  without having been  on XM for 18 months? 
[02:32:30]  So XM was doing us  a favor and spent  a boatload of money  to bring us to XM  because we're a charity case  because someone  had to hire us,  right?  Right.  That's how it works?  Exactly.  Had to hire us.  Charity case.  All right,  let's say hi to Elo.  Elo.  Hey, buddy.  Hi.  How are you, Elo?  Hi, Elo.  Thank you for the commercial.  You're not going to,  listen,  listen,  absolutely,  as my little Eagle Scout  plaque says here,  it was in there  before you guys  even mentioned it  on the air.  So we had bad timing? 
[02:33:00]  No,  I mean,  you had instinctive timing.  Instinctive timing.  I call it bad timing.  Such a diplomat.  Love him.  You guys were included.  I know,  listen,  it was funny  because Gary Hahn  and I were talking  about it when we heard  you on the air.  Gary called me  and he goes,  I've got him  in the Father's Day spot.  And I said,  they're never going  to believe you.  He goes,  I know they're never  going to believe you.  It's really tough  to believe that,  Elo.  Hey, listen.  I'm just being honest.  You're very honest  with us.  I've got to be honest  back.  There's a paper trail.  We'll check.  I believe you, boss.  That's right. 
[02:33:30]  I'll have Gary Hahn  get you a paper trail.  Give me a hold of  accounting.  You know something?  I'm going to give you  the benefit of the doubt,  Elo.  I believe you, boss.  All right.  Because I love Elo.  We all love Elo.  Hey, boy, at the end  of the day, does it  really matter?  I mean, the national  TV spot is running  all over the place  this week.  Come on.  Exactly.  Exactly.  We're nowhere in it.  And you're in it.  And you love when we  bitch, right, Elo?  Secretly, you love it.  Look, seriously,  I love it to a point. 
[02:34:00]  To a point.  And the point we  passed.  Yeah, really.  I love it when you  bitch for an hour,  not four hours.  Yeah, exactly.  I didn't like the  week-long bitch fest.  It wasn't a week.  It wasn't a week.  You sound like one  of the whack-bag  posters now.  There was a point  a year and a half ago  when you guys  couldn't get a  referred to.  Oh, yeah.  We couldn't get  anything right here.  Well, yeah.  It's true, though.  It's true.  Yeah, but it's  all right.  It's all good.  The place was a  bloody mess a year  ago.  Oh, God. 
[02:34:30]  But it's much  better now.  That's right.  That's right.  We need stand-ups  and all the best  buys done.  Elo, so who's  watching the World Cup?  World Cup's huge, dude.  You guys were ragging  on it earlier today.  World Cup's big.  The United States  goes today.  Do you only call me  dude when you get  uncomfortable?  No, I call you dude  when I really miss you.  I couldn't talk to you  all weekend.  No, let's be honest.  Who's watching the World Cup  or listening to World Cup  on XM?  Foreigners.  Actually, a lot of people  are listening.  I can tell you,  we did a research. 
[02:35:00]  We have about 650,000  people listening to the  World Cup this weekend.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, I mean,  the World Cup is  gigantic.  And I'm telling you,  turn it on now.  Just pull up and listen  to the Hispanic broadcast  on Deportivo.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  Deportivo.  That's what I...  Deportivo.  Yeah.  I was listening to it.  You gotta listen to it  in Spanish because  they're just out of  their mind.  You know what the  number one station is  for FH Riley's  in Huntington?  XM Deportivo. 
[02:35:30]  Flight 26.  Flight 26?  That's a John Zellner  special.  What is it?  It's like...  It's like a modern AC.  Modern AC, yeah.  Yeah, when people  are eating and stuff,  it's just the right  thing to play.  No 202 in the  restaurant?  No, no.  That's around 3 in the  morning.  People trying to eat.  They're listening to...  I got my signed DVD.  Thank you, buddy.  Oh.  Jimmy?  Yes?  I got my DVD.  Thank you.  Oh, good.  You are.  You know, Jimmy hasn't  listened to a word.  I have some.  He was talking about 
[02:36:00]  the World Cup being huge.  The John Zellner, baby.  You're reading the paper.  I would never do that  while everyone was talking.  Our boss is on the phone.  I'm really curious.  I'm curious.  Did you play with your  boomboxes over the weekend?  Yes, I did.  Yes, I have to hook mine up  because it's hard for me  and we're at my building  because my building's in a  corner.  I have a really weird  reception.  Even my cell phone and  everything there.  I just got to put my  antenna up.  Yeah, I have no idea.  Jimmy can't boombox from  where he's at.  I got outdoor space so I  get the boombox.  I have a little jacket.  And I was rocking and rolling  back to Manhattan with my 
[02:36:30]  propane tank just rolling  around the back of my SUV.  Well, you can't get  propane in Manhattan for  outdoor barbecues.  For grills and stuff.  So, yeah.  So, I got it filled up on  Long Island and brought it  in.  He went out to Long Island  to get some propane.  All right, Elo.  Anthony, did you get the  real quickly, Anthony, did  you get that email I  forwarded you from that  pest?  Yes, I did.  Did a good job.  He put us in one of the  commercials.  Yeah, I did an Inno  spoof.  He took the Inno, yeah, 
[02:37:00]  commercial and put us in  it.  Is it on opiumanthony.com  for people to check out?  It's somewhere.  Yeah, it should be great.  You can find it.  All right, guys.  All right.  Bye, sweetie.  You guys are in it.  I know you don't believe  me.  Cool.  Thank you, Elo.  Bye, boss.  Well, we have to believe  you now.  No, you don't.  You don't have to believe  me.  No, I believe you.  I'm telling you the  truth, though.  All right.  Thanks, Elo.  All right, see you guys  later.  All right.  No, it's so weird.  We have two phone calls  on the line.  John from Long Island.  Lucky Louie was brutally  awful.  The next one. 
[02:37:30]  The next one is Lucky Louie  was great.  It's the way it goes.  It's the way it goes,  right?  So is the way it goes.  Yep.  And you just want to  punch one of them.  Guess which one.  I don't know.  Put the first guy through.  You want to put him  through?  Yeah, why not?  All right.  Let's say hi to John  on Long Island.  John?  Yeah.  What's up, John?  It was an awful show.  All right.  Well, you can't just  say that.  What's your problem?  The first part, I think,  was the little girl  in the beginning saying 
[02:38:00]  why, why, why 12 times  or whatever it was.  That was the sexy part.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Great face for radio.  Oof.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  Heard that before.  Another guy that's  comedy about what we  look like.  I ain't no Tom Cruise.  Why?  I don't comment about  what guy he looks like.  There's always guys  that are like.  I ain't no Tom Cruise  myself.  I ain't no Tom Cruise.  Dude, do you honestly 
[02:38:30]  think, wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  Do you honestly think  the character that Jim  is portraying needs  a Tom Cruise?  He's portraying a piece  of shit, and he does  a very good job at that.  Dude, let me ask you  a question.  This is my question.  Lucky Louie, like any  other show, but it's  just a sitcom.  That's all it is.  It's no more, no less.  It's just a sitcom.  We have a little bit  more content freedom  than networks do, but  when you compare it to  shows that are on now,  whether it's Two and  a Half Men or whatever  the, what was her name  from Seinfeld who had  this show?  Julie.  Julie.  Julie.  I mean, are you really  getting more laughs from 
[02:39:00]  like according to Jim?  Actually, yes.  Okay.  Well, then that's the  show for you.  You guys spoke to that  guy last week about  something about Friends  or something.  He thought Friends was  funnier.  Was he a critic or  something?  Yeah, that was something.  That guy hated him so  much.  I wish I would have  handled that better  because I was so, I  was walking a weird  line when I was arguing  with that guy because I  never like to argue.  Like, if you don't think  something's funny, I  don't want to tell you,  yeah, it's funny.  You have to, I really  won't argue personal  taste like that.  There was just certain 
[02:39:30]  inconsistencies in his  review, which really made  me want to spit in his  face, like certain  examples he used, which  showed me that there  was something else going  on, like Linda Stassi.  That's what annoyed me  about him, but I was  kind of like trying to  walk a mind field.  I didn't want to argue  personal taste, which is  why I look like such a  retard in that.  Go ahead.  Yes.  I had to turn it off.  Okay.  Central 11.  I had to turn it off.  Why don't you give it  another couple of weeks,  see if it grows on you?  Because the pilot, I will  say this.  The pilot, I like the  way the pilot came out,  but it was directed by  somebody different.  Everything comes together 
[02:40:00]  a little bit better in  Coming Weeks just because  we're like more familiar  with each other.  The writing is a little  bit more specific for each  one.  And I've never seen a  sitcom that hasn't like  grown over a few  episodes where characters  develop more and things  happen.  But I mean, dude,  unwatchable.  Yeah.  Is that what you're  saying?  That's a weird one.  That's a little odd.  Like I said, the funniest  part was the little girl  in the beginning saying  why and him trying to  explain the earth and all  that other crap that he  was explaining. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  All right, John.  Fuck.  I would say, too.  I will.  You know what?  I'll give it a week.  I'll give it another week.  I mean, we watched the one  that comes before it there,  Entourage there, so it's  on.  Yeah.  So I'll give it one more  week.  How's that?  That's up to you.  Good for you.  One week.  Thanks, man.  It's funny.  People asked about the  laugh track on Wack Bay.  The laugh track was  the laughs you hear because  there was some explosive  laughs.  Every laugh you hear on  that show.  And let's clear this up  immediately is organic.  Louie told me that there's  a guy called the Laugh  Man or whatever he's  called.  He's in L.A.  And what he does is every 
[02:41:00]  sitcom uses some sort of  laugh track.  And this is all the big  ones, even with the live  studio audiences.  But they enhance with a  laugh track, which is why  the laughs are so even and  perfect.  A lot of times they're doing  like, you know, eight,  nine takes or whatever.  So they're just, you  know, I heard on Friends  because they were all like  executive producers.  Every one of them had to  be happy with the scene or  some weird shit.  So they would use a laugh  track.  And they tried to sweeten  something in Lucky Louie.  Louie recognized it and  goes, we got nothing on  that.  Don't sweeten it.  They made them take out  the sweet.  There's none of those 
[02:41:30]  jokes are enhanced.  It's there's no barrier  between the audience and  us.  So you're hearing laughs  bleed in through the  audience, through the  actor mics and bouncing.  It's really like old  school.  And that's why the laughs  sound like this really  weird laugh track.  Those are organic laughs  from the people.  There's not one joke that's  sweetened.  And that Louie's a purist  and I believe me, that's  just the way it went.  Some jokes don't work and  they're left in.  All right.  Let's say hi to Vince in  Chicago.  Vince.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Vince.  Hi.  That other caller's a shit  dick. 
[02:42:00]  Jimmy, you did a fantastic  job.  Thank you, mister.  I was.  Oh, God, I was rolling.  That is.  That is the best job of  casting since Keith Moon  did.  Oh, good.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Thank you, man.  Let's go to Bobby in St.  Louis.  Bobby.  Yeah, how you doing?  I watch the show.  I love the show, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  My wife missed and I  wanted to force her at  like 1230 to watch it  with me.  We're in the Midwest 
[02:42:30]  there, but I was just  too tired.  But yeah, I definitely  got to keep looking out  for that show.  It's pretty good.  All right.  Well, you know what?  You're getting just  about all positive  reviews here, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I mean, look, dude,  there's no show that's  going to be 100%.  There's plenty of people  that are going to hate it.  I don't mind people  hating it or thinking  it's not funny either.  That's a complete taste thing.  Certain things I just  felt were kind of like  Linda Stassi had a problem  that went beyond  just the jokes.  Can we play your scene?  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm embarrassed, by the way,  to hear my scene  because I will say one thing.  I'm very embarrassed 
[02:43:00]  about stuff like that,  but my character,  there's a scene where  I talk, there's like  a Planet of the Apes  reference, and part of  the character thing  for Rich was that  this guy was like...  Who's Rich?  Me.  Oh, cut it out.  I hope you got me.  You.  Why couldn't they just  call you Jim to make  it easy for everybody?  Mike is using his name  Mike, but I think  I'm named Louie  is using Louie,  but then again,  Pam's real name  is not...  Why do they do that?  I don't know.  What makes Rich  better for your character  than Jim?  I don't know.  I hate when they do that.  I don't know.  Because Nick DiPaolo 
[02:43:30]  is actually one of the  finalists.  Do we have to start  calling you Rich?  For the love of God,  I hope...  Rich, Rich...  A photo.  That's going to be fun  in the coming months  when fans go up to Jimmy.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, Rich.  Jim, you idiot.  I don't mind being rich.  No?  No.  It's easy enough  to remember.  Just think of dumb Voss.  I love being rich.  There was a...  Oh.  Oh, I didn't even  make that connection.  Ben.  Ben.  I'd like to be rich. 
[02:44:00]  Punch Opie's teeth out.  There's a...  Part of the character  description was this guy  is into, like,  again, comic books  and all that stuff.  And so, like,  in a couple of the  coming scripts,  they had me, like,  relating things to  comic book things.  It was just part of  this character's weird thing.  And my personality  doesn't go with that at all.  Right.  And it was eked out  immediately.  This is the only episode  with that element in there.  Really?  The writers were so good, man,  at finding who you were  and the brutality  of some of the lines I got.  And just great.  All right.  Coming up.  Well, here it is.  Jimmy from Lucky Louie 
[02:44:30]  last night.  I'm cringing, by the way,  through all of this.  I'm going to watch you.  Hey, guys.  I brought you some  fresh coffee.  Hey, thanks.  What?  We mean what?  I mean, what the fuck?  You never buy me anything,  you stingy prick.  I'm in a good mood.  Why?  Well, Kim told me  not to make any plans  because she wants to have sex  every night this week  until Sunday.  When was the last time  you got laid?  About four months ago. 
[02:45:00]  Okay, when's the last time  you guys had sex?  A couple of times  this morning.  I got a handjob  in a parlor  about two weeks ago.  See, and those are  all real laughs.  All of them are real laughs.  The weird part about being,  two things.  First of all,  I would love to have changed  handjob in the parlor  until I got jerked off  in a massage parlor yesterday.  Like, I couldn't, again,  pilot, you get too nervous  to try to change stuff.  The weird part  about doing that scene  is we're off to a side stage.  Like, Louie's living,  like, the kitchen, 
[02:45:30]  all that is center,  so the audience  is directly in front of you.  But on some of the scenes  that we do there  and then in subsequent episodes,  it's so weird  because there's a half-second delay  because you're on a side stage  and the whole audience  is watching you  on a monitor.  They're not seeing you live.  So it's like they're watching TV  and laughing at you on TV  so you have a half-second delay  which really is,  you have to get used  to that timing.  No, no, no,  there's no way to do it.  There's absolutely no way  to avoid it.  It's simply because  they're not looking at you.  They're watching.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  The set's got to be built.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They can't put everything  in front of the audience. 
[02:46:00]  It's just not going to work  and every show has to deal with it.  But it just takes getting,  like, a little bit used to,  like, you slow down your timing  because, like,  the first time we shot,  we were, like, stepping.  Yeah.  You think, oh, fuck,  no laugh.  Wait for it.  That half second,  you go, no laugh,  and I'll laugh,  and I'm fucked up.  More audio of Jimmy Norton  on Lucky Louie last night  on HBO.  All right,  I have seven days of sex  ahead of me.  That's all I know.  For exactly seven days, huh?  Why?  I don't know.  She's just...  Hey, wake up, dummy.  Yeah, she wants to have  another kid.  What? 
[02:46:30]  No, wait a minute.  What about your wife?  Is she trying to get pregnant, too?  Nah, Tina shut down her womb  after Jackie was born.  So, you know,  I just slip it in whatever.  It's a non-issue, you know,  but with, uh, Kim,  I can see it in her eyes.  She wants another baby.  Just another little baby.  What do you think, Louie?  This morning,  she just woke up  and looked at your  dirty, freckled cock  and thought to herself, 
[02:47:00]  oh, yeah,  I want that stuck in me.  Oh, maybe.  Dirty, freckled cock.  I will take full credit.  That was a Norton creation.  Of course it was.  So obvious, Toss.  And they're so great,  though.  Louie's just,  they're like,  yeah, all right, go with it.  Go with the dirty, freckled cock.  I feel great it is  to work under those circumstances  where no one has an attitude.  They're all like,  all right, go with it.  Let's do it.  All right, one more bit of audio 
[02:47:30]  of Jim Norton  on Lucky Louie last night.  Listen up, douche.  Women are bad.  You know, Rich,  just because your wife  divorced you  and took all your stuff  doesn't mean...  That is what opened  my eyes to the truth.  And the truth is,  women are powerful.  They're dangerous.  They used to rule  the world, you know.  Men were slaves.  That's retarded.  How could women rule over us?  We can kick their ass.  Yeah, but you see, 
[02:48:00]  the mothers rule,  and you can't raise  your hand to your mother.  I'll hit my mother.  I'll punch you  right in the face.  You're happy.  That's crazy.  Now you can.  Because we rose up,  and then,  we laid the patriarchy on him.  And then,  he expunged the whole thing  from the history books  and started anew.  Just like Planet of the Apes. 
[02:48:30]  Hi, Rich.  Hey, Paul.  Meet me in the bathroom.  All right, well,  I gotta sell some weed.  The biggest laugh I got  through that whole pilot,  and they almost kept it  and they didn't,  was when Paul came in.  This was after the audience  had already seen it shot.  And I stood up after I did it.  I said,  well,  I gotta go suck  that kid's cock.  And the laugh 
[02:49:00]  was deafening.  And Louis said,  the only reason  they didn't leave it,  and this is why I respect him,  he said,  the laugh was so huge,  but when you watched it,  you felt like the audience  in studio  knew something you didn't.  Like,  the laugh was too big  to just,  like,  the reason they laughed so hard  is because they knew  it wasn't the original line.  Like,  they saw it in juxtaposition  to that line,  so you just felt like  there was something  they knew that you didn't.  Yeah.  I wish they'd kind of  left that, though.  That was a gem.  Maybe for the DVD extras.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ooh. 
[02:49:30]  That is funny.  Louis was awesome.  I'll punch you right in the face.  That fucking Hagerty  is a funny bastard, man.  Louis was awesome.  That guy can fuck off.  Louis has tons of potential.  Jim looks awesome.  Lost so much weight.  Thank you.  Jim had great facial reaction.  Louis was pretty realistic.  Just some of the phone calls  coming in right now.  Oh,  and a lot of people saying,  stop playing it.  I T-voted it  and haven't watched it yet,  so we'll stop right there.  Oh, okay.  We'll take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  He's a woman,  you know what I mean. 
[02:50:00]  You better listen,  don't listen to me.  She's gonna set you free.  Yeah.  They're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show.  A little wolf mother  bringing us back  into the program.  I noticed that  Dane Cook used  a little wolf mother.  God damn rich cunt.  Did he really?  I didn't even notice.  That's the music  that starts off tourgasm.  Oh, I like that actually.  Okay, I told Bobby  I like that.  Yeah, and then it ends  with some wolf mother as well.  We gotta get Bob Kelly 
[02:50:30]  on the phone  to talk about tourgasm.  Probably sleeping now.  He was the star of the show.  Yep.  Jay Davies or whatever.  Jay Davis.  Or Jay Davis.  Ugh.  He's on a tour bus  with a bunch of comics  like what,  20 Dates in 30 Days  or something like that.  Yeah.  First episode  they have him crying  and admitting  he's a born again Christian  and he's turning  his life around  and to find a woman  he needs to purify himself  or whatever.  I'm like, ugh.  Good choice, Dane.  Good choice.  What was the bottom he hit? 
[02:51:00]  I don't know.  Actually, I didn't know Jay was...  I know him.  I know Jay.  I had no idea  he was a born again Christian  to be honest with you.  I don't think you trot along  in life and then  everything good is happening  and you go,  I want to be born again.  I think everyone  that's born again  has this bottom  that they hit.  Most born-agains  like have a wide-eyed stare  with tears brimming  at the bottom.  Right, right.  And they're going,  no, things are good.  Things are really good.  I've amended my life.  Tears brimming  at the bottom.  Yeah, as the fucking FBI  rifles through their computer files. 
[02:51:30]  No, things are good.  I found God.  Yeah.  I'm not even gonna,  you know,  I'm not even gonna make fun  of you if you're born again Christian.  I don't care, but...  I am.  You're a douche.  But what is Dane Cook doing  getting a born-again Christian comic  type guy on the bus, man?  You think he was going  for the conflict  of like a real-world  type reality thing?  I thought the first episode  was okay.  I kind of liked it.  I thought Bob Kelly  definitely is the standout.  Yeah.  And I will be watching  Torgasm every Sunday  because I have an interest. 
[02:52:00]  You know,  I'm interested in that  type of thing.  But, man,  he made the wrong choices  with this Jay Davis.  You only have four spots  on the bus.  And I understand,  like I think Ant was saying  or somebody was saying  this morning,  you'd want that conflict.  Yeah, that dynamic.  That's one of his best friends, too.  It really is one of his best friends.  I understand that.  Sometimes you gotta kick  your best friend to the curb  and get someone  that's a little more interesting  to help out your project.  What do you do  for the best friend?  Like, after the first episode,  after the first episode,  I'm thinking,  this guy has nothing,  nothing for this show.  In the end, nothing.  And I know I'm being harsh, 
[02:52:30]  but I think a lot of other people  saw it the same way, man.  Bob Kelly was just having fun  on the bus  and the guys, like,  you know,  getting all upset and stuff.  I think we got the porn clip.  Porn clip?  Jay Davis and Bob Kelly  fight about talking about porn.  It's four guys on a bus, right?  I wonder who's for it,  who's against it in this clip.  Well, Jay didn't like it  and Bob said it's only good  if it has children in it.  But Bob was talking about  how he has this porn tape,  it's called the red tape,  and he only allows people  to view it,  but he never lets you borrow it 
[02:53:00]  or something like that.  Have you seen the red tape?  Yeah, that's the catch.  I don't know.  He blew me to one.  I don't remember what it was.  I didn't remember the color.  Have you seen the,  you don't know?  Should have been called  the white tape  because that's what his face  looked like when I was finished.  But you've never seen the red tape?  No.  I don't talk porn with him.  I give him tapes.  So the guys are talking about porn.  It's like,  all right,  that's kind of cool  for this tourgasm,  you know, show.  Yeah.  And Jay Davis pops up.  I thought,  because he's a comedian,  I'm like,  just kidding and busting on these guys. 
[02:53:30]  And he never says that.  And then later in the episode,  he's crying  because Bob Kelly's  making fun of him too much.  Absolutely crying.  You know how these guys get  where they just attack,  attack, attack.  And Bob Kelly's like,  I can't be bothered with this.  I can't.  I can't do this.  Maybe he's just sensitive.  Well, let's try to get  Bob Kelly on the phone  and see if he's going to be  real honest about  his relationship with Jay Davis.  Right.  Here is one of the standout clips  from tourgasm last night  on HBO with Dane Cook.  Jay, what's the best porn  you've ever seen?  I don't want to talk about porn. 
[02:54:00]  Did you just say  you don't want to talk about porn?  No, there's nothing to talk about.  Really?  Yeah, it's not interesting.  Let me tell you how we do this.  We talk about porn, okay?  About having sex with chicks.  And it just lets everybody know  that, hey,  I still like chicks.  And it kind of, you know,  we're pissing on the tree.  You've changed, man.  Why don't you want to talk about porn?  Honestly, or porn.  Honestly, why?  Boring.  It's boring?  Yeah.  Don't pretend like you've never seen it.  I know.  It's part of a 12-step program.  Yeah.  Number three,  admit that porn is boring. 
[02:54:30]  You've got like 42 gigs of porn  on your, uh,  if it's lame.  You collect it like seashells.  At some point you've got to tap out.  I'm tapping out too,  but I'm not going to admit that.  You know what, dude?  I don't sit around  and talk about porn all day.  You want to talk about porn all day?  Is that what you want to do?  Because it's already been 25 minutes.  You want to talk about porn  for another 30 minutes?  Is that what it is for you, Robert?  We've got to talk about sex  the whole trip.  It's day one and a half.  Don't fuck yourself, Jake.  First of all,  it's not about sex, stupid.  You understand?  We're joking around.  We're having a good time. 
[02:55:00]  We're talking about a dumb porno.  And you're sitting there like,  why are you going to do that?  Like it's a bad thing?  Loosen the fuck up, dummy.  I am.  You grumpy cunt.  I am not.  And you just woke up  and you're a grumpy cunt.  You're the one yelling  like an asshole.  You're calling me a grumpy cunt.  Because you yelled at me, motherfucker.  I didn't yell at you.  Is that what it's all about?  With you?  Sex?  Why don't you do that at the end?  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-quack.  Where's the part where  Jay Davis admits  he's a born-again Christian?  Is that on here  where we didn't get that clip?  Well, first, 
[02:55:30]  we also have to get  to the pad data.  Yeah.  Uh, that is spelled  Torgazim  with an I.  Of course it is.  Wow.  Of course it is.  Derek is an idiot  with an A.  Derek.  He did not spell.  He just ran out.  Torgazim.  He spelled Torgazim  T-O-U-R-G-A-S-I-M.  I-M.  Torgazim?  Yeah.  Torgazim.  Torgazim.  You are a fucking  retard.  He's like,  what, what the fuck?  Here he comes.  Open-toed shoot.  Torgazim? 
[02:56:00]  You don't spell good.  Man, he really came across  as a real bright guy.  He's a dumb motherfucker.  I swear to you.  He looks like a young pilot.  Based on looks alone,  yeah.  You would think he's the smartest  guy in the whole goddamn room.  And he's a dummy.  Because he has a haircut  like the great Santini's son.  Fucking creep.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  When I change the pad,  I have to type it really quick.  And I usually don't  double check it.  Oh yeah, you're so fast  you have to add letters?  Yes.  All right, let me...  The I is nowhere near  anything you had to type. 
[02:56:30]  I'm looking at the keyboard.  Usually if you screw up a B,  it's an N or a V  got in there or something.  The I, nowhere near  anything you had to type there.  What, are we going to talk  about typing all day?  Yeah.  All they do is talk about...  All they do is give  typing lessons.  Bob Kelly explains  why he got mad.  Unfortunately, I think  this was after Jay Davis  admits that he's kind of  like a born again  or found God.  I don't remember the exact clip.  I wasn't paying that  close attention.  He's already ain't.  And that he needed  to purify himself 
[02:57:00]  or something like that.  Well, what Jay said  that got me upset was  all you talk about is sex.  Robert, he actually named me.  He singled me out.  Like, I was the only one.  Like, you know,  Gary and Dane  weren't in the conversation too.  Why don't I watch porn?  Because I'm trying to  clean my life up  and get closer to God.  To get the right woman  in your life,  it would be good  to be celibate right now.  I know it sounds crazy,  but I'm thinking  of really trying to do that.  It's very hard for me  because, you know,  I love women.  Maybe what you said,  you said wrong.  It probably came out wrong.  I didn't mean it 
[02:57:30]  the way he took it.  The way I said it,  he took it wrong.  You want to watch  some porn?  The kid's got to loosen up.  It's just a bad choice.  It sounds like  there's a few issues there.  It's just a bad choice.  Not that most stand-up comics  don't have that.  I respect the loyalty,  but the kid  needs to loosen up.  It seems like  he's not the right person  for this whole project.  I'm going to do  the same thing, though,  to get a woman in my life.  Yeah?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Clean myself up.  Just get celibate  for a while. 
[02:58:00]  My yoga teacher's  very lovely.  Came over again?  Mm-hmm.  And it was just yoga again?  How did it become...  Listen to me.  I'm a master  at spotting filth.  Yeah?  There's nothing filth.  Nothing, no.  Completely legitimate, man.  And a sweetheart,  really nice.  She's a boyfriend,  of course.  They don't do.  Yeah.  All right, well...  She's still nice.  I can still have a crush on her.  Tee-hee-hee.  So cute.  The next clip,  Jay Davis  cries.  He cries  because Bob Kelly  was giving him 
[02:58:30]  the business.  A little too much guff.  A little too much guff.  Go ahead.  This is what these guys do.  I know.  They attack your weakness.  They sit around  these comics  and it's brutal.  They just pound these guys.  You just gotta smile  and pray that it's gonna end soon  and they're gonna move on  to somebody else.  That's what you do.  But Jay Davis  breaks down and cries.  You know how many beatings  I've taken  from other fucking comedians, dude?  And dealt out.  I've gotten mad at times,  but I'm being 40 minutes in  and I've gotten like  a right already.  But you gotta take it.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Well, listen to how  40 minutes. 
[02:59:00]  Ouch.  Oh, yeah.  Bad ones.  Listen to how  Jay handles it, okay?  Jay, what's up?  One of these times  your lips are gonna get  stuck to an ass  and we're gonna have  to pry them apart.  That's bullshit, dude.  Like Christmas story.  Don't let me.  Jay, you're not  an ass kisser, are you?  No.  You're just a nice guy.  Yeah.  And because there's  so few of you left,  it comes across  like I'm an ass kisser.  That's not true.  He's an ass kisser.  Why do you gotta start  right now?  I'm kidding.  Just be giving me shit. 
[02:59:30]  Even in the phone calls  beforehand,  you're always digging at me.  I don't mind,  but dude,  it's like,  it's...  If you don't mind,  then shut the fuck up.  You're not being honest.  I've been nothing but nice  to you, dude.  But that's what I said  I'm cutting it off.  How come you don't get that?  Maybe if I had more credits,  it'd be easier  to bust your balls.  Dude,  if you think I'm gonna...  Dang.  You're both completely right  in your body of heads,  but you can't bring it  to that, dude.  This has nothing to do  with open or middle  or headliners.  You have conflict. 
[03:00:00]  You have different approaches.  Dude, you know what?  Okay, I won't do it no more.  I'm done with you.  I'm done busting your balls  like that.  You know, I hurt  because I'm sensitive  and, you know,  you're my friend  and you're just  fucking with me all the time.  Dude, I'm not gonna  fuck with you anymore, dude.  He starts hearing off.  I'm sensitive  and you're my friend.  I gotta disagree with it.  Oh, this is the perfect choice.  This guy is a...  Jay is nut.  There could be some action  in the future episodes.  I'm hoping, but I don't know, man.  A bunch of alpha males  wouldn't be good  because Gary,  Gary,  I don't know 
[03:00:30]  that you see this side of him  because he seems  like a really quiet,  good-natured,  fucking really strapping  motherfucker  is a psychopath.  Gary is an angry,  crazy fuck.  I'd hate to have him  angry at me.  Bobby's an alpha male  dumb fatso  with that awful Muslim cap.  Dane is just kind of  a millionaire  and fucking, you know,  hanging out  and Jay is like a kook  in the other way.  You need that dichotomy, man.  Super sensitive jackass.  I get that.  I just hope there's,  you know,  it might be just  a one-trick pony,  though, man.  This is it, you know?  Well... 
[03:01:00]  But then Bob Kelly decides  he won't bust his balls.  Dane tries to calm Jay down.  John, this scene,  you didn't see Torgasm?  No, I was sleepy pie.  Well, I got advanced copies, man.  That's the beauty  of doing live reads  for HBO  on the other side  of this show.  I saw Torgasm  at 8 o'clock at night.  It was perfect for me.  I didn't see it.  So Jay goes running off  to the bus  and he's in one  of the cubicles  that we just saw  out there  with the curtain  completely closed  and he's crying inside 
[03:01:30]  and Dane Cook  is trying to talk to him  through the closed curtain  to calm him down.  With the cameras rolling  and Jay doesn't know  the cameras are rolling.  Oh, God, no.  You might hear  Jay kind of muffled  in the background.  That's because  there's no mic on him  and the curtain  is completely closed.  Eek.  I gotta handle him  with kid gloves  or not handle him at all.  It's like, you know,  the big lion  playing with the little cub.  It's like, we're playing  and it's like,  I can't play with you like that  because I'll hurt you  and I don't want to hurt you.  I don't want to make you get mad.  Just the fact that Bob 
[03:02:00]  that he uses  fucking gay male terminology  like fucking big lion  playing with the little cub.  Playing with the little cub.  Is it?  Faggot.  Isn't that like, yeah,  some kind of type  of gay terminology?  I'll hurt you.  Shut up, Bob.  He's got more skills.  Spit gum right off  his fat forehead.  Fat lion.  Yeah.  Eating the fucking cub  because he's too lazy  to hunt.  Shithead.  I don't want to make  the kid mad  but he's sensitive  and it's like,  you know what?  He jumps in and out of it. 
[03:02:30]  He'll bust balls.  He'll have fun.  It's because he's got that ADD.  Whatever, dude.  But he's reading the book  and he might get through  the first paragraph before.  You know the comic mentality, man.  There's a lot of ball busting  going on.  There's a lot of...  I'm pretty cool with that.  I know that Bobby pushed you, man.  He pushed you far  and you spoke up  and you told him.  I want to say a prayer.  I want to go kick some ass  on stage tonight.  I'm going to be funny  and I'm going to have  a great time up there.  Nothing's going to  take that away.  Gary kind of busted my balls 
[03:03:00]  like, you know,  you're a kiss-ass  but he left it at that  and then Bobby  continued to embellish  and it was like  digging and digging  and digging  until finally  I was just like,  you know what?  This is day three.  I'm not going to allow this  to happen  throughout this whole trip.  Do what you just said, man.  Bring your real emotion  up on stage tonight.  You let it be known  for yourself  and whoever else  you care about seeing it  that that's what matters  to you, man,  is the show.  that there has to be  that type of  psychobabble 
[03:03:30]  fucking analyst  bullshit  going on  on a tour bus.  Here's what that  should have went.  Shut up, faggot.  Shut up.  Stop crying, baby.  Well, you know what  that happens?  Anytime someone cries  on a bus,  the other three cocks  should be stuck  through the curtain.  Go ahead.  Work on the one  of your choice.  Bob tries to get  analytical at one point, too.  It's like,  if you know Bob  and you know  he is as dumb  as they come  and if you look at him,  all you got to do  is shave his face  and he looks like 
[03:04:00]  De Niro waking up  in Raging Bull  when they're bringing  sexual assault charges  against him.  That fat gut  that just tap  his big stupid arm.  Champ.  Get a wake up, champ.  I introduce him to men.  Stupid lumbering ox.  I want him to grow  his beard heavier  and get that  Alzarkawi look.  You'd just know  he'd look just like  Alzarkawi.  Oh, dude,  I'm like the big cub  playing with the little cub.  I'll hurt you.  You have to step  on my foot, maybe.  Why don't you shut up?  You're like a Piper cub  playing with a little cub. 
[03:04:30]  Fucking airplane-sized human.  So I guess  it was a good start  to tour.  Yes, I explained it.  Go fuck yourself.  I didn't even get it,  but it was still...  It was definitely  a good start.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's interesting to see  how it unfolds.  Is this going to be  a complete car crash  or whatever?  Because I know,  I mean,  Dane obviously shoots  a special.  They all survive it  and they're all friends,  but they did.  I remember,  we've talked to Bob  while it was happening  and they did get  very uncomfortable  at times.  I couldn't imagine  spending that much time 
[03:05:00]  so close to the people  that you're working with  in any capacity.  Yeah.  I can't.  We had toyed around  with the idea  of taking a tour bus,  taking this show  and going cross-country  or something  and broadcasting  for various places.  I don't know.  I love you guys,  but go fuck yourselves.  You were the one  that said no.  I would need  my own bus.  I can't be around  people for that  length of time.  You're embarrassed  about your duties.  He's probably afraid 
[03:05:30]  his shit's going to  stink up the bus.  That too.  Fucking greasy.  Are you kidding?  I've let out  a two-minute fucking snake  in the bathroom here  while you guys  are taking a piss.  Yeah, we're two minutes  and I'm done.  I'm taking a shit.  Did we tease anything  or mention anything yet?  Tomorrow's the day, I guess.  Okay.  Well, let's just say this.  We got a nice announcement  tomorrow.  Big announcement.  Why don't we get a bus?  No.  I want a bus.  I want a bus.  I don't want a bus.  Yes, you do.  Because I think  we've only scratched  the surface with Anthony.  We have.  If he was forced  to live with us 
[03:06:00]  on a tour bus  for a week or two.  Or even a few days.  I could not  make their fucking deal.  Anthony wears girls' pants.  How does that come out  of like  that I don't want  to be around you?  Anthony paints his toes.  He's embarrassed.  We're going to see.  He wears boy shorts  from Victoria's Secret.  They are adorable.  It's a whole creepy ritual.  He puts on a wig  with a pigtail.  And it's okay  because it says boy.  They're boy shorts, right?  It's a ritual.  I do not.  He dances around  singing who's a pretty girl.  I am. 
[03:06:30]  I am.  I think if we were  all on a tour bus,  Jimmy and I would like,  we would just be  looking at each other like,  Did you see that?  Why is this happening?  You saw that, right?  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Let's make believe  we're not seeing  what we're seeing.  I would spend  all the time  watching television  and just  doing nothing.  That would be it.  I don't like...  You wouldn't be  hanging in the back, man.  Doing what?  Talking?  Telling jokes and stories?  We do that all day.  Telling stories.  Telling ghost stories.  Getting to know each other. 
[03:07:00]  That's my God damn job.  How about telling ghost stories  in the back of the bus?  With a flashlight  at your chin  to look even scarier.  About the time you thought  it was a ghost  and it turned out  it was just a neighbor  with a heart on.  All of a sudden it's like,  guys.  No flashlight at your chin.  Guys,  have you ever cried?  Oh.  Tell us when you cried.  Yeah, we could videotape it.  Yeah, why not?  Put it out.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, we want the tour bus.  We want the tour bus.  We want the tour bus.  We're getting one, too.  Only if it stops 
[03:07:30]  at a hotel  every night  at 5 o'clock.  Why is that so loud?  Because I'm deaf.  What?  But why don't you  leave it in there?  It's so...  What?  It's like loud.  I, uh...  Yeah, I'd want to stop  at a hotel  5 o'clock every night  and sleep  and then get back on the bus  to wherever you want to go  is fine,  but I need a hotel by 5  for room service  for dinner.  That's fine.  I'll accept that.  Okay.  Have we negotiated this?  Yeah.  We'll just say yes  and at 5 o'clock  we'll just drive  right by the hotel. 
[03:08:00]  You want to jump off  at 65, stupid?  Otherwise,  you're in your hotel.  I thought you were  being sincere  for a moment.  You want your room service?  Here's some chips, fucko.  You know, Jimmy,  I'm sensitive  and I thought you were  going to be...  I'm breaking your balls  right away.  You're getting  fucking religious.  We got a film crew  in here today.  Yeah.  Not too distracting.  There's just two of them.  Yeah, that's right.  The lighting and the sounds  are all right.  No, that's good  that there's not  fucking lights and shit  when they bring in the lights  is when it's a pain in the ass. 
[03:08:30]  What are we filming today?  And I never noticed  any difference.  There have been video crews  that come in with a boom mic  and a fucking camera  and they tape shit  and it looks like us  in the studio.  Then there's people  that set up  umpteen thousand fucking lights  and check and everything  and white balance.  This takes five fucking years  and it looks exactly like  the guy that just came in  with the boom mic.  Remember 2020 was in here?  Which I never got paid for  by the way.  Fucking, they only money.  Oh really?  Go get it.  You go get it.  Yeah.  I'll do my own expose.  That was a waste of time.  They filmed four hours in here.  They didn't use one second. 
[03:09:00]  I guarantee you  that was an ABC decision  when they saw it was the show.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  What are we filming today, boys?  Yeah, what's being taped?  Don't talk into your own boom mic.  Oh, now you're going to be quiet?  This guy had a million questions  when the mics weren't on.  Yeah, I'll be shy.  He was all happy to be here and stuff.  He's got the accent.  Huh?  Oh my God.  Hold on.  This is going to stink.  What?  Why are we here?  Yeah, what's going on?  Don't point at each other.  Don't be shy.  We're going to be one of your guests today.  Ah, who's our guest? 
[03:09:30]  Tommy.  Tommy Tiernan.  Tommy what?  Tommy Tiernan.  Tommy Tiernan.  What are you filming for?  He's got a couple shows coming up, I think.  Yeah.  He's a comic stand-up.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah?  Doing a documentary?  We're doing a documentary.  We've been following him for the last two years.  On him?  For two years?  Two years.  Two years.  Holy shit.  What's the documentary?  Like, why cover so much?  Ah, why don't I let him explain it?  All right.  That's probably a good idea.  That's really fucking a long time.  That is a long time.  Are you sick of him yet? 
[03:10:00]  I'd say he's probably more sick of us than we are.  Okay, fair enough.  Where are you from with that accent?  From Ireland?  Oh, yeah.  I recognize that.  Nice.  You too, sir?  Ireland?  No, I'm from Australia.  Okay.  I was actually going to guess New Zealand.  I'm just hooked up with the team for the Manhattan section.  You could all just revel in how much England sucks, right?  Both of you.  Yeah.  Irish.  Yeah.  Australian.  Both been persecuted by those motherfuckers.  Right?  No?  Where's Tommy from? 
[03:10:30]  Where's Tommy from?  We've sorted it out these days.  Have you?  We're all common.  I haven't.  I hold a grudge.  I'm still holding a grudge.  I'm still holding a grudge for you guys.  We're the superpower.  And they laugh.  Australia's huge.  What do you guys got?  Any nuclear missiles or nothing?  Oh, there's something in the center there.  I don't think I have nothing.  Pine Gap, I think.  Yeah.  Pine Gap.  Is that like your group lake?  Is that like Area 51?  Very secretive.  Yeah?  Australian got shit.  The Australians always go into jail for fucking Indonesia. 
[03:11:00]  They always go over there to smuggle coke because it's close.  They get caught and they go to prison for life.  Or get killed.  They'll put you to death over there.  Hey, what happened with those Australians that were busted in Indonesia recently?  There was a bunch of them.  They were hanging out in one of those spas that people go to visit, like a resort.  Right.  And they got busted trying to smuggle drugs.  There was a bunch of them out of a big ring recently.  Oh.  Well.  You don't read much news, huh?  No, I've been over here for four years.  It was a big story.  Four years?  You don't get much Australian news.  You Aussies don't lose their accent.  You don't get a lot of Australian news over here. 
[03:11:30]  Aussies never lose their accent because they know chicks fucking dig it.  But I guess they're in big trouble if they got caught over there.  How far is Indonesia from Australia?  Four hours, six hours.  Okay.  Boring.  It's still far from where you are in Australia.  Depending where you are, see?  It's like saying, how long is it from the United States to Hawaii?  It depends if you're in fucking L.A. or New York.  Six hours or 12 hours.  Australia's got to be 10, 12 miles across.  Perhaps larger than that, Anthony. 
[03:12:00]  Let's go to Chris in New York.  Thanks, guys.  We'll get Tommy in here in a second.  Chris.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  And believe it or not, I actually have a serious question for you.  All right.  Last week, when you guys were talking about wanting to have a commercial on XM and they  not supporting you in all throughout your careers, and all throughout your careers, you've  known what you wanted to do, and you've known what the end game is.  Right.  What do you see as the end game?  Blowing up our careers for the third time?  Where do you want to be when your career's done?  Yeah.  When we finally blow up our careers again, it'll be an even bigger story than the last two 
[03:12:30]  times put together.  Yeah, this is it.  Because we'll be bigger than we were before.  But how big?  50 markets?  100 markets?  International?  As many markets as we can get into.  That is the end game.  There's no real end game.  It's infinite, my friend.  It is infinite.  Yeah, I guess there's no real answer to that.  We just want to be the biggest radio show out there.  That's the end game.  Well, congratulations.  You just did that. 
[03:13:00]  We're getting close.  We're working on it, Popeye.  Thanks, Chris.  All right, guys.  Why don't we take a quick break, and we'll get Tommy in here with the film crew from...  Sounds good.  Where are you guys from?  Australia, Ireland.  Ireland and Australia.  And he's from where?  Ireland as well.  Ireland as well.  Galway, actually.  What?  Galway.  Galway.  Is he well-known in Ireland?  Yeah.  Like, compared to a comic in America.  He's the Chris Rock of Ireland.  Wow.  Whoa.  Is he right?  Wow. 
[03:13:30]  Obviously, he's white, but...  That's pretty...  Yeah.  Of course he's white.  Figure that out.  From Ireland.  I would hope so.  You don't have black people over there, do you?  We do, yeah.  Not really.  They're called Italians.  Do you treat them well?  Do you treat them well?  Very well.  Yeah.  No racism over there?  No.  You don't really hear about...  We love everybody.  The hate crimes over in Ireland.  It's all English, Irish...  Too busy getting...  Protestant, Catholic.  It's not racial, it's religious.  No, I understand that.  I love your Guinness, by the way.  So do we. 
[03:14:00]  Yes.  How about...  Keep sending that over.  How famous is Billy Connolly over there?  He'd be pretty famous, yeah.  Got another comic you could compare it to?  Not really.  He's kind of out on his own at the moment.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  I thought you were going to say Dr. William H. Cosby.  There's problems between the two camps, huh?  No, he lost a bit of respect there for some comments a couple of years back.  What did he say?  It was during the hostage, some hostage crisis during the Iraqi war. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Right.  It wasn't very PC.  What did he say?  Something like, I wish they'd just get it over and done with.  As in, pertain to the fact that they usually end up killing the hostages.  Now, were they Irish hostages?  No, no, no.  No, he's a British guy.  Oh, right.  Oh, what was it?  I remember that.  The Kenneth Bigley or that guy?  Were they beheaded?  Yeah, the newspapers took it out of context.  Just get it over with?  I couldn't imagine him saying that unless it was in some kind of dark comic context. 
[03:15:00]  There was a whole preamble that came before it, I believe.  Yeah, but they never printed it.  No, the paper's much too, uh, oh, boy.  Yeah, we can't be bothered with what he said before or after it.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  We'll get Tommy in here, see what he's all about.  The film crew will roll.  That guy did get a beheading, by the way.  Kenneth Bigley.  Of course he did.  And I'm sure you watched it.  I have seen it.  On some internet fucking site.  Why are you watching those?  You fucking ghoul.  Why not?  Because you're a ghoul.  No, I'm not.  You are a ghoul.  Why do you enjoy watching something like that? 
[03:15:30]  Because every time, it just reminds me of exactly who we're dealing with.  I know that it's, uh, uh, what we're dealing with without having to watch that.  It is the worst thing you can ever say.  I like to sleep at night.  Yeah, I know.  I want to be able to go to bed and sleep without waking up going, ah, ah, ah, in the middle of the night.  A lot of people ask where my edge is.  That's one of them.  I can't watch that.  A couple times they have popped it up in the office.  I'm like, goodbye.  Yeah.  I start watching and I don't even get to where the blades are. 
[03:16:00]  I can watch long distance stuff.  I watch bombings, like soldiers shooting each other.  That's great stuff.  But that other stuff with the, uh, that's a little too up close and personal.  And I could even do R. Bud Dwyer.  Yeah, it's quick.  R. Bud Dwyer, I have no problem watching.  It's the idea of a knife sawing through someone's neck.  You can hear them trying to breathe.  It takes time, right.  It takes too long.  It's not, it's not R. Bud Dwyer with a bullet through his head.  It's over. 
[03:16:30]  How many have you seen?  A few.  He's got the box set.  I've seen a few.  You're cool.  No, but I don't get a pleasure out of it.  I don't get a misshapen pleasure out of it.  No.  It's there.  So I look at it.  It's very, very disturbing on a really primal level.  Doesn't it stay with you like a fog over you for a while?  Yeah.  The Eugene Armstrong one.  They were all awful.  But for some reason, I guess that one bothered me the most because you could hear him trying to  breathe.  It was just, it hits you on like a really primal level.  Yeah.  But it also, it's like these are the fucking savage, savage people we're dealing with. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  They're awful fucking human beings.  Awful.  I ain't watching that.  I have no love for any of them.  Pornography.  I enjoy that too.  That's what you watch on the internet.  I put that on right after.  I had to fucking cleanse the palace.  Cleanse the palace.  It is.  When you see something uncomfortable, there's nothing like watching a girl blow a horse just  to fucking put you right back where you belong.  You don't know who's luckier.  Horse or her.  Let's take a break and we'll talk to Tommy next, okay? 
[03:17:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  So be it.  Threat no more.  Just a kill of pieces.  To prepare for more.  So be it.  Settle the score.  Touch me again with the words that you will hear evermore.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:18:00]  We got a film crew ready to go.  So you guys want the big intro, I guess, so it looks good for the documentary.  Jimmy, you want to do the big intro for Tommy Tiernan?  Tommy's here.  Tommy Tiernan's here in the studio with us, but he's not in yet.  Could he come in?  No, no.  You got to go and here he is.  Like the film crew's waiting.  Okay.  They're filming the door right now. 
[03:18:30]  Okay.  Here's Tommy.  Tommy's here.  That's the big intro.  He needs a big intro.  All right.  You know, this is a big deal.  Okay, guys.  The documentary.  This right now is Thomas Tiernan.  Coming in.  Oh, my God.  It's so awkward for everybody.  What?  I do a good introduction.  Was that the best introduction ever?  I didn't even hear.  It was great.  Neither did we really. 
[03:19:00]  Jimmy gets scared.  He gets nervous.  He gets very nervous when there's a big star in the studio.  They're doing a two-year documentary.  They're two-year.  He's not leaving that intro in.  Two-year documentary.  Yeah.  Why?  What?  Because not that much happens in my life.  Is that it?  You need to like spread it out.  Everything.  It's a slow burner.  It's like three minutes a day, maybe.  Not even.  Not even.  A full full of weeks.  How much would that actually figure out per day for two years?  All right.  Who's the math whiz? 
[03:19:30]  Does he have to make that face when he films?  What face?  Very heavy camera.  Or he's kind of, you know, he's got to shut one eye.  Especially if it's just a half-hour documentary they're doing.  He's got to shut one eye.  Yeah, a half-hour documentary.  It's like the life of the mayfly.  It's got to be done in fast motion.  Get your two years in.  So is this going to be shown anywhere?  DVD or what?  It's going to be shown in Ireland in the winter.  On TV?  On TV.  All winter long.  How many installments?  Like episodes.  There's four episodes. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, okay.  An hour each?  Half an hour each.  Okay, so two hours of tape.  Now, why two years?  Because the documentary's about me coming over working in America, so it's spread over  two years.  So I've been coming over the past two years.  Do you go back and forth or do you kind of stay here for two years?  Back and forth all the time, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Where do you work when you're here?  I do theatres as opposed to comedy clubs.  I actually saw you in a comedy club.  I was doing a place.  There was a blow on a guy in the bathroom, right?  That was it, yeah.  Oh, that wasn't a comedy club.  That could have been one of any number of clubs. 
[03:20:30]  Rest stop.  It was a two-blow minimum.  I was playing in the Village Theater and you were in a comedy club downstairs around the  corner.  Oh, the cellar.  Comedy club.  Yeah.  Great place.  And I actually saw you in a DVD the other night.  It was a Louis Black collection of shorts and it's got the Burton Dick store.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, right, yeah.  Then we did that in like 2000.  Oh, boy.  I'm finally going to be alone with Hillary.  Yeah, what's the name of that again?  I love that thing.  Side splitters.  Side splitters.  They're actually doing HBO.  We bought the rights for that.  Something like Owen Wilson or something. 
[03:21:00]  He's like exec producing or something.  Jesus.  Don't you do a spit take in that?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's fabulous.  Yeah, when she goes, do you want to see my pussy?  Sure I do.  A spit take.  Mr. 1935.  Very good.  So they're doing a two-year documentary on you about coming to America.  I never actually worked in Europe.  I mean, I've never been to Ireland or been to England.  You translate here?  Yeah, there's a few cultural references that don't.  Like, I would do a lot of stuff about the Irish tinkers and stuff like that. 
[03:21:30]  And we have no idea what that is.  I don't know.  What the fuck is a tinker?  They're like gypsy people.  Oh, gypsy people.  Oh, yeah.  All right, we got the same thing.  It ends the same, too.  We thought they were the faggots.  Wait, gypsy.  Oh, you don't get it.  I am really lost.  Yeah, right.  Because I know it's mean and racist, but I want to get it.  Who's Ed Byrne?  An Irish comedian, right?  Ed Byrne, yeah.  I've seen him here.  Dylan Morin.  I don't know if you know any of the other guys.  Billy Connolly would be the biggest guy.  Eddie Izzard. 
[03:22:00]  You know, guys like that who have come over here before.  You do theatre, so it's more like long form.  Yeah, it's more rambly, you know.  Instead of just getting up there and, you know, joke punchline.  It's interesting because I'm doing the Letterman show.  We're taping it tonight for Friday, and the whole point of that was to try and cut what  I do down to four and a half minutes.  So I would have like a ten minute chunk, and it's mainly bullshit.  It's kind of, it's not really direct or, you know, like I'm talking now.  Yeah, it's just a funny story. 
[03:22:30]  Well, you're waiting for the point, you know, so that's the way I talk, you know.  And so the whole thing of the past weekend has been trying to kind of shill it down into  four and a half minutes, so that's the kind of journey.  How tough is that?  I mean, because you don't do that.  It's hard, yeah.  We'll see how it goes tonight.  Yeah.  You know.  Don't bring up the speakers.  You taping tonight?  Taping tonight, yeah.  I don't know what you're talking about.  They tape Monday for Friday?  Yeah.  How do they do that with the topical jokes?  Like how do the monologue, how do they do it with monologue?  I can see the stand-ups, because, you know, we know we're doing it. 
[03:23:00]  Robert Duvall is on it and Sonic.  Fuck am I jealous.  Fuck am I jealous.  You don't have him picture with him?  I certainly don't.  Wait, we're supposed to have him come in.  I'm not even kidding.  Don't tease.  That's Ben.  I'm telling you, Robert Duvall is coming in here.  I'm doing Leno on Thursday, and I'm doing it with Kate Beckinsale, who is apparently very  popular.  I have no idea who she is.  Yeah, but you don't know.  Google her name, my friend.  I would fucking rather do, I'd rather just do Duvall.  I mean, you know, I'd rather fucking meet Duvall, man. 
[03:23:30]  Well, that's you, lucky bastard.  I'll tell him you said hello.  Fuck am I jealous.  Tell him the tango stinks, by the way, and to stop doing it.  He likes to tango.  It's a fucking awful dance.  No one enjoys the tango.  It stinks.  So how big are you in Ireland?  Huge.  Seriously?  We have no idea.  Yeah.  Can't walk the streets?  I'd be one of the top one comics in the country.  Really?  It's weird.  He's the guy.  Certain guys, like Lee Evans comes here, and he's known here, but he is massive in England, 
[03:24:00]  and here he's like, you know, he has a niche because it's theatres, so people who know him  from there will come see him.  But it's amazing.  You don't realize how famous some guys are.  Like Billy Connolly is famous everywhere in the world, and here is his least amount of fame.  But that's when you find out, though, if you're, because you know, sometimes when you become  really well-known, when you walk out on stage, people can start clapping because they know  you already, and they like you, and it can, your work can get worse over a period of years  because you don't have to try so hard because people don't like you. 
[03:24:30]  So when you arrive in a place where nobody knows you, nobody knows you, you know, you  can't coast on that.  You have to just produce it for strangers.  Would people like run over Bono to get to you?  No.  All right.  All right.  At least you've got some reality here.  Yeah.  Bono, the biggest thing on the planet Earth.  Yeah, he's huge.  And others, some of the closer planets.  Right about now, he's like, I can't believe these guys don't know me.  We really don't know you.  We're not going to fake it.  I don't know.  He understands, man.  It's like, what do you think?  You think I'm like that?  No, that was a joke. 
[03:25:00]  See, we're comedians, too, believe it or not.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.  No, we like to get the laughs out, too.  We have that stupid, dry American humor.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Very sarcastic and dry.  You think of England, too?  England?  Not really.  No.  Biggish.  No, no, not really in England.  Mainly in Ireland.  Mainly in Ireland.  Ireland's very small.  I mean, Ireland is the size of, you know, I don't know, some place, local culture reference.  Not very large.  There's a small reference here.  Ireland's not that big.  It's the size of something smaller.  How big is it? 
[03:25:30]  Rhode Island?  No bigger than Rhode Island.  No.  We have a population of 4 million.  It's 150 miles wide and 350 miles long.  100?  Jesus.  350?  That's bigger than Jersey.  You know.  It's about one oomph the size of California.  Texas.  Texas.  It could be smaller than that.  No.  I don't know.  We're all doing geography like fucking reports.  Stupid geography lesson.  No.  None of us know.  Let's nail this statistic before we move on.  It's smaller than Texas.  What's your material?  What do you riff on? 
[03:26:00]  Religion, sex, family, death.  Because I'm here and politically incorrect.  You're not one of these guys that kind of...  No, I've been done for blasphemy a few times.  Really?  Yeah, I've been...  You've been what for blasphemy?  I've been done for it.  I've been charged with blasphemy.  They charge you for that?  Well, no.  That was a bit more dramatic than the reality of it.  I was hoping you wouldn't ask.  Like 1,300.  They put him in water with a chicken and they weighed them both.  They used to do it in Salem.  See if you were a witch. 
[03:26:30]  Fucking morons we were.  I know.  Well, you weigh more than a chicken.  You're guilty.  What?  If you float, you're a witch.  Yeah.  Right.  Fucking two little girls they listen to.  If you sink and drown, you're innocent.  But you're, you know, you'll be taken care of.  Well, I apologize if we're wringing out your corpse.  Silly geese.  So they charge you a blasphemy for...  For what?  Like, what did they like?  Because I did...  I mean, I suppose it's the same with TV shows here.  You can't do the same material on a network show than you can in a nightclub audience. 
[03:27:00]  And I made the mistake of thinking that you could.  And I went on and I did this material about the Virgin Mary and the Lamb of God and stuff like that.  It was six or seven years ago when there was a big blasphemy thing in the Irish Parliament about it.  And then most recently I went on and I cursed a few times on TV.  And the people were...  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission had to look into it.  And they made the TV station apologize and stuff like that, so...  In Ireland they have, like, a FCC here.  Yeah.  It's the BCC over there.  BCC, yeah.  And you can't curse? 
[03:27:30]  Like, are there set rules?  Or is there that gray area?  Like, we have satellite radio, obviously.  You can say whatever you want.  You can say shit.  You can say shit?  You can't say that here.  See, we can't even say that.  We can't even say, like...  You can say shit on TV?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not if you're reading the news.  Or the weather or something.  But if you're...  You're gonna shit yourself at this one.  It's from Scotland, wasn't it?  Yeah, that was my Scottish.  I can only do Scottish.  I can't do Irish.  If we have, like, this... 
[03:28:00]  It all comes out the same.  It's some type of bastardized English.  You can't say shit.  And you can only say cunt as an adverb.  Like, cuntish.  I had no idea what an adverb was.  I just, like...  I thought it sounded funny.  You actually know.  Cuntish, yeah.  It was kind of a cuntish day.  Look at the cunty head in them.  You guys got a little easier.  Because we can't say anything.  I mean, the standards...  Now, when you do television,  any material, television here in the States,  any...  You ever get in trouble? 
[03:28:30]  Because you're not...  Well, my first thing is tonight.  So, the Letterman show...  Two years of a documentary  and the first television you're doing is tonight.  Yeah.  It's all built up to this, folks.  It's very European cinema.  It's a slow wind-up.  Are you nervous?  I'm not so nervous now, no.  We kind of...  I was very nervous on Friday  when I did my first set.  And it was, like, 11 minutes long.  And the guy said,  OK, we've got to cut...  You had to cut seven minutes out of a set?  More or less, yeah.  Wow.  And then he said, you know,  a lot of the stuff that you think is funny, 
[03:29:00]  we need to...  Get rid of.  Yeah.  Wow.  Here's some material Jim Norton wrote.  Oh, yeah.  Please.  I'm struggling taking...  It's hard for me to take, like,  sometimes out of five minutes.  You've got to have five minutes  and then three for panel.  You don't know if you're going to need the panel.  But you do five,  and then all of a sudden,  you finally got it.  OK, it's five minutes.  This is what I have to do.  Then one crowd,  you talk a little slower,  it's fucking six minutes.  Or, like, I talk faster,  it's four and a half.  Like, you can't get that exact time.  But your stuff is quite dark, isn't it?  Some of it is,  but, I mean, Len will let you,  like, give you a lot of leeway.  But I know the material is OK. 
[03:29:30]  It's just a matter of timing it out.  It's fucking...  It's brutal.  It's 11 minutes, man.  It's a big cut to go.  But we think we...  The last show last night  was in Carolines.  We had four minutes  and 33 seconds  of solid gold.  So hopefully...  We're going melt  in the meantime.  Dude, you should just do what you do  and then stop.  Like, look at your watch.  I finally go...  So then I come up...  That would be a great bit, though.  Someone should try that.  Good kicker for the documentary.  Yeah.  Just fucking...  Oh, camera.  Robert Duvall, 
[03:30:00]  I'm so jealous.  I'm obsessing now.  Paris Hilton is on...  They've recorded two shows  on a Monday  and Paris Hilton  is on the early show.  The one that will air  tonight, probably, right?  You get to see her?  I don't know.  Is she worth having a look at,  do you think?  I don't know.  Look at her feet before me.  Didn't you just say  you didn't like her?  Did I say?  Who was the one  that said that  Paris Hilton  should be off the wall?  Camera guy?  I don't know.  She lost my respect.  Why did she lose your respect?  She's a slut.  And she likes big cocks.  She's a good girl.  How does a slut  lose your respect?  He didn't like the way  her tape was directed.  Yeah, they thought 
[03:30:30]  the camera work  was shoddy.  Shoddy.  Fucking love her.  Yeah, no care.  Sturdy, rich, brat.  Look at her feet.  Tell me if they're big.  She's very light, isn't she?  A what?  She's very lice.  Light?  She doesn't weigh much.  No, no, no.  She's a wonderful thing.  You throw her around, really.  She's a fat puss, too.  Elfin, like.  Yeah.  Elf.  Waifish.  Little pointy ears.  Hey, Waif.  All the easier  to snap her neck  when you're done.  Smash her face  in Lucky Charms  and then just brutally  sodomize her  in a fucking Marriott. 
[03:31:00]  Lucky Charms.  Why Lucky Charms?  Magically delicious.  There's a picture.  Well, he said Elfin.  There's a picture  of her up here somewhere.  That's very good.  With the pink over there.  Is that an elf?  Is that Jude Law?  Fucking leprechaun.  Look at this.  Look at this  little fat puss  hanging out.  Is that fucking...  He likes fat ones.  Tommy, he likes  the fat puss.  Yeah.  All gone agricultural  all of a sudden.  Nice big fat. 
[03:31:30]  Big fump one.  Any politics  comes into your...  Not really.  No.  Religion?  What do you got on religion?  I'm not going to do  material for you.  Right.  No, I don't want you  to do material, but...  Nah.  What angle do you take on it?  What angle do I take on it?  For or against?  For God.  Is he good or bad?  Go.  I'm pro-Jesus, absolutely.  Ah, good.  Pro-Jesus.  But in a very life-enhancing,  joyful, non-sectarian,  ecumenical sense.  Keeping the guilt out of it. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, keeping the guilt  out of it is correct.  Guilt-free Christ.  Do you take the piss  out of religion,  as they say?  Yes.  Yeah, I do.  It's all done  in a hopeful way, though.  You know, you've got to be...  The great Bob Dylan line  is to live outside the law.  You've got to be honest.  You've got to try  and just infuse the thing  with a sense of mania  and joy  and recklessness  and hope.  That's what I try and do.  That's not what religion's about.  Really?  It's all about guilt  and hurt  and fear  and... 
[03:32:30]  Pain.  Pain.  Say it.  Say it.  And the Jews.  And the Jews.  Let's all just say it.  And the Jews.  Being Irish  is like being Jewish.  We're kind of like the Jews  but not as focused.  You have that kind of  outcast feeling,  that kind of  persecuted over the years.  We're the blacks of Europe.  Yeah.  You know,  the blacks of Europe.  Yeah.  I think Irish people  have a lot in common  with oppressed tribes  around the world.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Lithuanians,  Romanians, 
[03:33:00]  black people,  Jewish people,  Puerto Ricans.  Kind of pulled yourselves up  by the bootstraps  over the years, though.  How do you mean?  It's not quite as bad  as it used to be.  No, but I think  there's a kind of  heredical...  Hereditary?  Hereditary.  Thank you.  Seconds away around two  in my corner.  I think there's a kind of  a...  What's it called?  A tribal historical  memory gene.  Like an instinct.  Yeah.  Of oppression in the past. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, I think certain...  You know...  People of certain backgrounds  have that.  It's almost like, yeah,  some kind of instinctual  thing that's...  in them  when they're born  to feel persecuted.  We'll just have a memory of it.  Like I...  From doing this stuff  around the clubs here,  I found that  the black people  really laugh at my stuff  because it's all about  family and sex  and they can really  identify with that.  Whereas I found  when I was in California,  they were slightly more  reserved  and it was slightly more  kind of...  uptight jizz buckets. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  That is East Coast,  West Coast,  my friend.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a little different.  I definitely think  there's a tribal gene,  you know,  that we remember stuff  that we haven't experienced.  Hey, were you surprised?  Was there any stuff  that you wanted to do  on Letterman?  They're like,  no, no, no,  you can't do that.  Not because they didn't  think it would translate  but because it was too mean.  I had a line  which was about a young...  about boys learning  about sex.  Oh, yeah.  The line I had about it  was one boy says  to another boy,  your mickey goes hard  and they said to me, 
[03:34:30]  you can't describe  an erect penis  on television.  And you said  you didn't.  Isn't that weird?  Like...  I said erect penis.  We find it fascinating  sometimes with the FCC  that you can't say  certain things.  Like, that's harmless.  That's innocent.  And sexy.  Two boys discussing  their mickeys.  How do you not enjoy that?  Two fellas  in their little mickeys.  That's bound to happen.  Yeah, so...  Your mickey can't go hard  on TV.  So how did you fix it  or you just took it out?  I took it out.  I whipped it out.  He said goofy instead. 
[03:35:00]  No?  Your mickey goes goofy.  Your goofy goes Mickey.  Your goofy goes hard.  See, the joke  has replaced  the part that wasn't.  I know.  When you see Robert Duvall,  tell him nobody's  fucking tangoing anymore.  Make a point about it.  Stick your face  in this dressing room  and just go,  the tango eats ass  and slam the door.  Don't think...  Why is he...  What do you mean?  I don't know.  He's notorious for  he thinks the tango  is elegant.  It's his hobby.  Really?  Yeah.  He likes to tango.  He did a movie called  Assassination Tango.  He could do anything 
[03:35:30]  he wants.  He was in The Godfather.  He certainly was  but he wasn't  fucking tangoing.  Maybe I could help  as he's spinning.  Stupid ass.  Well, you know what?  You're out, Tom.  There were...  Coppola was really  trying hard to get him  for the last one  and he wouldn't do it.  He priced himself  out of it, I think,  on purpose.  They think it was shit  and he knew it was shit.  Wow.  I don't blame him.  But Assassination Tango  is apparently about a guy  who's an assassin  and he goes to commit  a murder somewhere  in some foreign country  and he passes by this place  and he sees this girl  tangoing  and he learns the tango. 
[03:36:00]  Now you've had your dance.  Fucking horrible.  At the end,  he shoots himself  when he sees the dailies.  Blech.  Did you see anything  cool in America?  Did I see anything  cool in America?  Anything that stands out  that's going to make  the documentary?  I don't think so.  We went shooting  and stuff like that.  We met some Indians.  We went to a big church thing  down in Texas, 
[03:36:30]  the Lakewood Church Center  and the other guy  gets 22,000 people  every Sunday morning.  Jesus.  The young guy  that's on TV?  Joel Osteen.  I think I see him on TV.  Really?  If it's the same guy.  That's a lot of people.  Well, they bought  the Houston Rockets  used to play basketball.  Okay, that's the guy.  The Lakewood Church  bought the arena  and now they're playing  somewhere else  and he's on every Sunday.  If you're going to church  and you need arena parking,  you're a religious fanatic.  Wow.  Do you find the people  a little off?  Well, you know,  it was just,  there were lots of,  there was a few  autistic people there  and stuff  and they were jumping up and down  but it was just, 
[03:37:00]  it's just a feel-good thing.  I mean, 22,000 people  don't arrive at something  unless it has some  feel-good factor.  Yeah.  I've seen films  of like when they're,  they got both hands  in the air  and they kind of  shut their eyes  and it kind of looks like  they just did heroin.  You know?  They're just whizzing  in their pants.  They're just having  a good time.  If you go with the flow  of it, you know what I mean?  It's actually quite enjoyable.  If you kind of get rid  of the part of your brain  which watches what you do  and is sarcastic  to yourself all the time  and you take a nap.  What can you almost like  feel the joy around the... 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, if you don't believe it.  If you just kind of say,  okay, it's like being  at Disneyland  with some retarded children.  Do you know what I mean?  You just kind of go  with the flow of it.  Right.  It's cool, you know.  How long of a service is it?  It's about an hour.  Oh, that's not bad.  All right.  22,000 people got to file  in that fucking place  for an hour?  For an hour.  But they all come before  and they,  because the same people  go every week.  There's a pre-show  and everything, I'm sure.  A lot of buses, I bet.  Yeah, and they meet each other.  Hey, I haven't seen you  since last week.  Yeah.  Since a week.  Yeah.  God damn, that's a lot of...  Flipping around 
[03:38:00]  on Sunday mornings,  I see it.  It's crazy  how many people  he's preaching in front of.  Fucking, all he's got to do  is get boxed.  That's all I would do.  I think it's the guy  I'm thinking of.  What else?  What if there's just nothing?  What?  What do these people get...  Like, what if there's just nothing?  They still have  the feel-good feeling.  Yeah, they walk out of there  every Sunday.  They're happy.  They kind of...  Because you...  Like, he talks about the Bible,  but he doesn't go into  the nuts and bolts of it.  He doesn't actually...  It's kind of...  Oh, he says this,  everybody should feel good  about themselves.  It's very...  It's kind of Bible-lite. 
[03:38:30]  You know, it's...  It's ineffectual.  Not ineffectual.  It's...  What's the word I'm looking for?  Jim?  Jimmy.  It's non...  It's non-secular?  Non-denominational?  Non-faceted?  Non-interesting?  Non-biblical?  Yeah.  It's Bible-less.  Bible-less, yeah.  It's very light.  It's very light.  Oh, Bible-lite.  Bible-lite.  I like that.  No one gets hurt in it.  Less calories.  Less calories.  They stop at the parts  where they turn into  pillars of salt.  Where else did you go  in a murder?  And then Jesus said, 
[03:39:00]  take your...  God said,  Abraham, take your...  Nah, take him to the park.  That's too heavy.  Forget that old  sacrifice thing.  You let chip thine eyes  deceive the...  Ah, vizine.  Nothing.  You went to an Indian reservation.  I'm not hitting me.  Indian reservation.  He went to an Indian reservation.  Oh, how was that?  That was very boring.  Was it?  Yeah.  They killed squirrels.  I didn't know that.  What?  For what?  To eat.  Their grandmothers  liked to eat squirrels.  We met this guy, Jerome.  He was the head  of the Winnebago tribe.  Jerome?  Yeah.  Is an Indian name?  And there's a Winnebago tribe?  Yeah.  A bunch of white trash 
[03:39:30]  driving around  in fucking RVs.  You might have been  in West Virginia.  No, it was in Nebraska.  Nebraska.  Nebraska.  The Winnebago tribe.  Yep.  Google it.  They're there.  No, I don't doubt it.  And they said...  He says,  they're very laid back  and very calm.  And I says,  what do you do?  And he says,  well, we hunt.  And I says,  what do you hunt for?  You picture buffalo or something?  Yeah, squirrels, he said.  And I says,  why do you hunt squirrels?  He says,  well, they're very hard to catch  and our grandmothers  like to eat them.  Ugh.  Ugh.  So, that was...  My, how the Indians  have just fallen. 
[03:40:00]  Used to just be hunting  big tatonka  with the big spears  and arrows  and now...  It's squirrels.  They're honking squirrels.  They're playing whack-a-mole  for grandma.  How...  Oh, degrading.  No wonder they just drink.  Once a proud people  just step on your prey.  Gone.  Step on your prey.  Fucking horrible is that?  Someone runs over  a squirrel on the highway  Indian crying  on the side of the road.  That's horrible.  So, you doing any gigs 
[03:40:30]  in the States?  Yeah, he's got...  You're doing a theater.  You're doing...  Yeah, where are you at?  Live at the Actors Playhouse.  That's a queer place.  107th Avenue  between Christopher  and Bleecker Streets  starting June 20th  through July 5th, right?  July 15th.  July 15th.  Three weeks here.  Three weeks, yeah.  For tickets,  call the box office  212-463-0060.  And there's a money-back guarantee  if you don't laugh.  Oh, really?  Uh-oh.  And it...  We don't have that  on this show.  We certainly don't.  We go broke.  And you have to call...  Or go to telecharge.com. 
[03:41:00]  I'd actually like to come  see this show  because I was going to go  see Lee when he was here  but I was busy  and I wanted to see Billy  and I didn't see him.  I want to see one of our guests.  I have not gotten to any show.  I suck.  I really want to go see you.  And of course,  Tape and Letterman tonight.  That will be on Friday night.  That's very cool.  Cool.  Tommy Tiernan.  Thank you so much.  Thanks for having me.  And I definitely want to  come see you  maybe next week sometime.  I'm going to send you  a tape of the documentary.  Yeah, do that.  How long is that going to take  to edit?  Five years?  About that, yeah.  It would be funny  if they edited it in a week. 
[03:41:30]  Just real sloppy.  They filmed like  the first two hours  of the trip  and that's the whole thing.  and they show him  coming back  with a grayer beard  in four years.  They just do real  shoddy sloppy work.  That wouldn't be funny at all.  Well, for us it would be  but for the guy  that told you about it  it wouldn't be good.  We'll be on for three seconds.  Yeah.  That's a montage  in the middle of the documentary.  Yeah, two years.  How long is this going to be in there?  Really?  If it makes the cut at all. 
[03:42:00]  I don't know.  This might be a feature.  We might become very popular in Ireland.  Shut up, stupid.  Can people get this radio show  in Ireland?  On the internet.  They probably can.  Yeah, we've gotten  some people from Ireland  that have...  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  On the internet.  Australia, England.  I've gotten some weird emails  from people.  That newfangled thing  called the internet.  I love it.  I'll tell Bono to come on.  Do you talk to him?  All the time.  He doesn't talk back.  He doesn't talk back.  Just a follow-up.  Very good, very good.  He is like  the most famous guy ever. 
[03:42:30]  Who's second?  Like the guy  can't walk around anywhere.  Who's second most famous?  I don't know.  Mick Jagger is up to it, Bono.  Yeah, he's right.  I'm talking Ireland.  There's a fraternity of people.  Paul McCartney.  He's another one  that can't walk around  anywhere in the world  without no one.  I'm talking when it comes to Ireland.  Ali.  Homegrown.  Homegrown guys.  Homegrown?  Colin Farrell,  you're saying in a second?  I'd say maybe Pierce Brosnan.  He's famous,  but not really...  Is he Irish?  There's no street credibility.  Yeah.  Colin Cleen? 
[03:43:00]  William Wallace.  Old Willie Wallace.  He couldn't walk around, I bet.  Who the hell is  Willie Wallace?  William Wallace.  Scotland again.  Scottish.  I was making a Scottish  because I did a Scottish hat.  You were being Scotological.  I was being scared.  Like the whole thing's  one to me  because I'm stupid American.  Do you guys know  Colin Quinn over there?  No.  Exactly.  Good.  Stupid Colin.  Stop trying to tie in  with your Irish roots.  They don't give a shit about you.  Holy crap.  That idiot.  I tell you what,  it annoys Irish people  to hear American people  say they're Irish  and they're not actually Irish. 
[03:43:30]  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Well, we're kind of  just tracing back a little bit.  I mean, America hasn't been here long.  I know, but it's kind of like  you get these guys,  oh, I'm Irish,  and they've never been there.  I just want to feel like we belong.  You're only a couple  of hundred years old here.  I always say that  I'm part of the Irish.  I just ask women  what nationality they are  because if they say  part like Native American,  I know they're probably  going to have a fat puss  and that's all I care about.  It's genetic with them.  I love it.  And we had to beat  the shit out of a little place  called England, my friend.  That's right.  To gain our independence.  Did you beat the shit out of them  or just not drink their tea? 
[03:44:00]  A little bit.  That hurt them at the time.  We've got to go with  what's happening at the moment.  That's a joke.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  The tea thing was a little silly.  We'll show you.  I'm not drinking this.  That was a little outrageous.  Hey, they dressed up like Indians.  They had a costume party.  Well, look what we do  to your tea.  Oh, boy.  The shockwaves throw at Europe  when you stop drinking  the tea and skews.  See, we think it was  a big day for us.  We got a little lucky.  I do.  And the fucking guy  at guard duty saw it  and just kept reading  the paper. 
[03:44:30]  Hey, dump it.  Get an old country full of it.  Keep dumping the tea,  you idiots.  Maybe that's where you got  the idea for iced tea from.  Possibly.  But no, because...  Cold tea.  But then...  But back then,  there was no ice.  There wasn't.  No, I'm saying  when they threw the tea  into the sea,  it was cold.  It was cold, and then...  I doubt anybody drank it.  Well, I don't know.  What is the temperature  of Boston Harbor?  About the...  Ben would know.  It's 54 degrees.  And the brine  would probably ruin  the taste of the tea.  The salt as well.  Yes, yes.  The salt, the brine.  And the vomit 
[03:45:00]  from all those fucking  Boston drunks  throwing up  after a Sox game.  Those fucking  horses' asses up there.  Don't, don't,  we're gonna throw  some tea in the water.  That wasn't about Boston.  That was just about  a bunch of drunks  from fucking Massachusetts.  It had nothing to do  with England.  They just wanted to  cause a ruckus  after a game somewhere.  Fucks.  World Cup soccer,  anything on that?  Oh, I don't have  any material,  but I'm very excited.  I'm not asking  for material,  I'm just saying  in general.  Mexico and Iran yesterday.  It's great to see  just different tribes. 
[03:45:30]  Italy and Ghana today.  See, we don't get it.  That's brilliant.  Yeah, America is like...  You're playing  Czechoslovakia  at lunchtime.  I mean, they're  broadcasting the games  on XM.  What channel?  I don't even remember now.  Elo loves when we  promote other channels,  but I don't get it.  I'm trying.  I'm reading some  of the articles  in the paper.  I'm taking a peek  with the coverage  on TV,  and it's just like...  Isn't sport boring  to you?  Yeah, it's one of those  things where someone  on Comedy Central  on The Daily Show  hit it right on the head  and he was being funny  about it,  but it rang true.  He was talking about  all, like you said,  tribes and these 
[03:46:00]  pretty much countries  and these ancient rivalries  that go back  to wartime.  It's a metaphor  for these battles  and wars that took place  when you got England  and France and stuff,  and we like  the actual thing  instead of the metaphor.  We'd rather just  really bomb things  and really have  wars than, you know,  play it out in a game.  You know, you guys  could be playing Iran,  you know, in the World Cup.  You're both in it.  Yeah, and that seems silly  when we can just drop bombs  on the real people  in the country.  Why kick a ball around 
[03:46:30]  when we can just bomb  the real people?  We'll be nuking them soon.  Yeah.  What was Mexico  over Iran a big surprise?  Just send big soccer ball  looking bomb down.  They try to hit it  with their head  real stupid  and it just goes off.  Bunch of soccer ball bombs.  They've been shoving  soccer down our throat  forever and it's just  not catching on here.  I don't care what people say.  And we had Elo on saying  650,000 people are  listening to the coverage  on XM.  It's the biggest sport  in the world.  But that's all kind of  like the immigrant population  of America is checking  that out.  Not, what, what? 
[03:47:00]  Someone just wants  Jimmy to tell them  when ice was invented,  you idiot.  Ice.  I mean, we didn't have...  Oh, Stuart, thank you so much  for calling him out on that.  No, listen, Stuart,  you guys bucket...  It was ice invented.  What I mean is  the ability to refrigerate.  Stuart knows what I mean.  We didn't have that back then.  You didn't say that.  You kind of had to invent ice  if you really think about it.  Of course you did.  No one was really using it.  In ancient times, 
[03:47:30]  before they could refrigerate,  they used to have  some type of insulation  made of straw and mud  and like kings would ask people  to go out and bring snow back  and they would bring that back  and make a tasty little treat  and have actual ice.  You know how awful  that must have been?  Dirty snow that was transported.  But it was awful  like a glacier.  How tasty was it?  It was awful like a glacier.  It snows all over the world.  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  But, you know,  if you're in Egypt,  I don't think you get much ice.  And by the way,  they're not watching  the World Cup in Mogadishu  since the Islamic extremists  took over.  Not allowed. 
[03:48:00]  Of course not.  Why would you?  That's fun.  People enjoy it.  Yeah, but we have so many  other sports to pay attention to.  Iran might be playing  Israel.  Yesterday, Portugal  were playing Angola  and Angola is a former  Portuguese colony.  So you've all these amazing...  I mean, if the game  doesn't translate over here,  that's one thing.  Maybe we're just too stupid  about the rivalries.  Like you're talking about  things like,  oh, this Portugal-Angola  you've got to understand  what these two have going...  No, we don't.  You've got a feel  for Angola, I think.  From sea to shining sea, 
[03:48:30]  everyone else goes  fuck themselves.  That's our motto  here in the States.  Actually, can I have that back?  I'd probably root for Portugal.  Portugal, yeah.  Portugal won.  I'd root for Angola.  Would I root for them?  Are they the good guys?  Angola was oppressed,  I believe.  Angola?  Yes.  Wasn't Idi Amin  in charge of that place  for a while?  No, that's Uganda.  Oh, I thought it was  another one of those nations.  Yes.  See, we don't need  to know world history.  He was a self-confessed  cannibal.  Stupid world history.  There was somebody  buried in Angola, though.  No, Angola used to be...  Angola used to be... 
[03:49:00]  Zimbabwe used to be  Rhodesia?  And Muslim...  And Muslim week...  See, Robert Smith  was the white guy  and he...  Yeah, exactly.  No, they change  the goddamn names  of these places  too often.  I know.  Shouldn't be allowed.  Do you know that Palestine  used to be called,  I think, um...  something else?  Do you know Iraq?  Cradle of Civilization,  my friend.  New project.  Meh, meh, meh.  Mag...  Meh.  Madagascar?  Mess... 
[03:49:30]  Mesopotamia.  Oh, very good.  Thanks, Anthony.  And that's why  their soccer match  against...  M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I.  So World Cup is exciting,  but we just don't know.  Yeah, but the game  is good as well.  I think the...  I noticed about your games  is that it's...  a lot of it's about  control, right?  You can catch the ball,  right?  But where in soccer,  the ball is out of your  control most of the time.  It's kind of this  free-form thing  that's running around  the place.  It's out of anyone's  control.  It's on a field 
[03:50:00]  that's much too big.  Whereas Americans,  it's all about grabbing  and holding on to it.  You know, whereas  European sports are more  about things flying  around the place,  kicking.  Because America's  all about me, me, me,  me, me.  Grab it.  It's mine.  Give it to me.  It's mine.  And Europe is kicking it.  I don't know.  He's got it this week.  This one's got it.  Who's the best soccer  player in the world?  A guy called  Ronaldinho from Brazil.  Ronaldo, right?  No, Ronaldo used to be  with Ronaldinho now.  He's kind of a buck-toothed,  got a little bit like  goofy.  He's long hair.  He's an amazing soccer player.  Is he the Ronaldo guy?  No, there's Ronaldo  and there's Ronaldinho. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, there's two different  guys?  Yeah, they're both  Brazilian.  Where's the Ronaldo  plays for Barcelona?  He's on the same team  as David Beckman, right?  Ronaldinho plays for  Barcelona.  Ronaldo...  They all play for  Barcelona.  No, Ronaldo plays  for Real Madrid.  How does he know?  I just know.  I fucking follow  everything in the world.  No, you don't.  I'm knowledgeable.  You're an idiot.  Jimmy is really  knowledgeable.  That's right.  Girls play soccer here.  Don't they?  Meadow Soprano play soccer?  Yeah, like kids play  soccer and then once  they reach a point  that we don't care  anymore.  When they finally  can talk back to  mom and dad,  they go on to another  sport.  I don't want to  play soccer. 
[03:51:00]  Well, here's the thing.  Even though this sport  might be very popular  here, the USA,  through some weird  thing over the past  few years,  is ranked fifth in the  world.  Really?  So you guys might get  a bit of momentum  during this World Cup  and it'd be a huge  thing.  How great would it be  to win the World Cup  when the rest of the  world knows that our  whole country just  doesn't care about  soccer.  No riots.  It'd be like five  guys outside waving  flags.  Go.  Who cares?  Something's going on  because you look at  the team, they don't  look American.  They might have  passports and stuff. 
[03:51:30]  Are you thinking  it's a loaded team?  I think they loaded  the team up.  Yeah?  Sure.  With your people  from South America  or somebody?  A few people from  other places.  That Rinaldi guy.  Now American.  Is that how they do  it?  You've knighted  somebody American  on me?  What type of  citizenship test  you've taken?  Wait, so Ronaldo's  a guy and  Rinaldi-o?  Who cares about  Ronaldo and  Rinaldi-o?  No you don't,  Rinaldi-o?  Are they both  Brazilians?  Are they both  Brazilians? 
[03:52:00]  They're both  Brazilians.  Why aren't they  still filming?  This is some of  our best stuff.  Yeah, we talk  soccer like  nobody's business.  This is inane  babble about  I'm listening to  Jimmy talk about  Ronaldo.  It's Rinaldi-o.  Whatever his name  is.  The book Toothboy.  800 times he's  saying his name.  What about the  Tee in the Harbor?  Enough about  Rinaldi-o.  You must have  hated Rinaldi-o.  That could have  made the documentary  The Tee in the Harbor?  Huh?  No one cares  about the Tee in the  Harbor bit.  Alright, we gotta  get out of here.  Yeah, we're  actually leaving.  Oh my god, I heard  he has a lot of  money.  I wonder if there 
[03:52:30]  are any clips  about people who  are rich.  I mean, do we  have any clips  about people  that are rich?  Goddamn rich  cunt!
