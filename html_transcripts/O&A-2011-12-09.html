<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a comedic introduction by William Shatner.  The hosts immediately launched into a discussion of pictures from the "I Like Girls Daily" Twitter account, featuring nude women, accompanied by sexually explicit commentary and observations about Pamela Anderson's aging.  This transitioned into a call from Joe from Jersey, who revealed suicidal thoughts due to job loss and eviction.  The hosts attempted to counsel him, engaging in a lengthy conversation about suicide and its impact, punctuated by their typical sexually explicit jokes and references back to the "I Like Girls Daily" photos.  A veteran caller, sharing his experiences overcoming adversity after losing an arm in combat, offered a contrasting perspective.  Further calls detailed personal hardship and loss.  A caller named Bobo disrupted the somber tone by claiming he was rumored to be banned from a party at FH Riley's, leading to a bizarre discussion about this rumor and a potential confrontation.  This segment concluded with continued discussion of suicide and Bobo’s increasingly strange behavior.

The show continued with more calls from Bobo, focusing on his anxiety about the FH Riley's party. The hosts relentlessly teased and insulted Bobo, even showcasing a picture of his 16-year-old half-sister on air and discussing his dog, Mr. Maloon Again.  This was followed by a highly offensive argument between Jordan, a caller, and Jimmy, laden with insults and homophobic slurs, despite Jordan's occasional comedic interjections.  The conversation veered into discussions about Jordan’s karaoke skills, Bobo’s continued FH Riley's woes, an upcoming Donald Trump appearance, the quality of steak in Canada versus the US, and a picture of a woman with a possible skin condition. More insults and offensive humor permeated this segment.

The next segment began with criticism of an intern, Matt, focusing on his coffee-making abilities. This devolved into vulgar speculation about the absent Eric Nagel’s sexual activity and hypothetical offspring, humorously imagining the privileges of a potential "Prince Nagel."  The hosts then ridiculed the upcoming *Three Stooges* remake, particularly the inclusion of Snooki, with one host providing a Curly Howard impersonation.  Studio guest Mike Baker's leather jacket became a topic of conversation.  A call with Otto provided humorous firearm advice for a gun range. The main event of this segment was a lengthy phone interview with Donald Trump, covering the Middle East (including the downed Iranian drone), the Iraq War, his opinions on President Obama, his potential candidacy, views on various Republican candidates (Romney, Bachmann, Gingrich, Cain, Perry, and Palin), China's economy, the American healthcare system, and the need for stronger American leadership. Trump promoted his book, "Time to Get Tough: Making America No. 1 Again," and invited listeners to a book signing.  Following the interview, the hosts and Mike Baker briefly analyzed Trump’s comments.

The show continued with a discussion on the exorbitant rise in college tuition costs and its impact on middle-class families.  This transitioned to politics, mentioning Herman Cain and Donald Trump, including a past feud and their apparent reconciliation, partly due to the intervention of Trump’s son.  Obama’s foreign policy, including the killing of Bin Laden and the handling of the Middle East, was debated.  The conversation frequently digressed into lengthy discussions about the penis sizes of various people, including Jonathan, described as having a "massive bulge," interspersed with live reads for sponsors.  Mike Baker again participated in the discussions and live reads, with multiple guests repeatedly asking if they were on air.  The segment ended with further penis size speculation and final thoughts from the hosts.

A final segment focused on workplace pranks orchestrated by Rowan, including placing boxes on the heads of coworkers and guests like Steve Sterniolo.  The hosts detailed other pranks involving liquid ass, numerous pranks targeting producer Steve C., and a series of pranks against Eric Nagel, culminating in the destruction of his lunch and the hiding of his jacket.  A call from Jordan, initially using a helium voice, led to a discussion of his unpredictable behavior.  The conversation touched on Jordan's relationship with Anthony, a party at FH Riley's, and concluded with a promotion for Argentium jewelry and its owner, Steven Singer, known for his Superman bed.

The show’s penultimate segment included a call from Jordan, expressing concern for a frequent caller's safety.  The hosts responded with vulgar jokes and banter, briefly touching on family and social circles.  Promotional plugs for Trojan condoms and Danny J. Ross’s Twitter account were interspersed.  The segment concluded with a final vulgarity directed at Eric, a mention of a potential future discussion about a friendship with Donald Trump, the usual sign-off, and plugs for social media and the next show, Ron and Fez.

Let's get the show on the road.  Turn it sideways.  No.  Turn it sideways so it goes in portrait mode. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You want to see it that way?  Holy shit.  Dude, look at that.  God damn, that's a great way to start a Friday.  I start my morning with, I like girls daily.  God damn, that girl is.  That's the only Twitter account you should be following, by the way.  Fuck us.  Fuck everyone else out there.  You're not following I Like Girls Daily.  You might as well just shut off your Twitter account.  I'd get kicked off a plane.  Especially if you like girls.  I would get kicked off a plane for looking at that. 
[00:05:00]  I Like Girls Daily is so damn good.  I would assume gay guys are following this, too.  Oh, they have to.  Because how do you not like this?  Wow, she's beautiful.  How do you not like this?  I'm going to just put that as my, like.  I'm a little scared that this one might be a little on the edge of underage.  Nah, nah, she's fine.  Nah, she's fine.  I would say she's about 19, 22.  Yeah, yeah.  I know I Like Girls Daily is on the up and up, on the up and up.  She's a college girl.  They don't mess around with that.  She is beautiful.  Is that a new one?  Like, was that just posted?  Fuck yeah, that's a new one, man. 
[00:05:30]  Was that just posted?  She's got fat knees.  What time?  Shut it.  41 minutes ago.  Look at her fat knees.  Shut up.  41 minutes ago.  Look at that fucking, that is insanely hot.  It's a blonde.  You're crazy, Jimmy Norton.  Fat knees.  Nice try, Jimmy.  You're going to lose on this one.  Jimmy's just trying to.  I don't like a fat knees.  Look at her left knee.  Nice try, Jimmy.  It's beautiful.  I don't like the freckle.  Hopefully from fucking, where?  She's totally nude and.  Totally nude. 
[00:06:00]  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  And it's a hot blonde at the beach.  God, that is amazing.  There's another one she posted that.  But, you know, I'm not a.  That's crazy.  I got over my tit monster face years ago.  No, I like regular girls.  But look at this one.  I kind of like that.  Those are natural, big jugs.  Those are jugs.  And there's women out there, you motherfuckers.  You'll bite your lip and it'll drive as nuts as men.  Jugs.  It'll drive as nuts.  Look at that. 
[00:06:30]  She calls them on her site, knockers, when they're a little too big.  She just goes.  Knockers.  She goes, sexy lip biter with big knockers.  That is.  Yeah, she's biting a lip, a little to the side, like a.  A brunette.  And her hair is.  Her hand is.  Hair is sweeping across her eye like Hitler.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got nice jugs.  Almost like the Biebs.  A longer version of the Bieber haircut.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she's got a cup of tea, it looks like.  Oh.  Covering up her naughty area. 
[00:07:00]  Some chamomile.  Probably chamomile.  Is it chamomile?  It's probably time for bed.  A little chamomile.  Chamomile will get you ready for bed.  Oh, my God.  I like Girls Daily.  Yep.  I used to follow another Twitter account that had naked broads.  Yeah.  I don't even remember their name anymore.  That's fucking.  To be honest with you.  That's a great picture.  And the beach looks great, too.  The water's all clear.  It looks warm.  I might be getting older because.  Well, I know I am.  Because I think that one scares me a little bit. 
[00:07:30]  What?  The hot blonde at the beach.  See, you're crazy thinking that would scare you.  She looks like a young Pam Anderson.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Before Pamela Anderson fucked up everything with all that stupid surgery.  Got all heinous.  Remember the natural pictures of Pamela Anderson?  Why the fuck would you fuck with that?  Well, she got older.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but she started messing with that before she, you know, needed to.  Yeah.  She was just a natural beauty.  She was pretty, man.  Wow.  This girl's really a knockout. 
[00:08:00]  That's crazy.  From the mid-thigh up, she is absolutely amazing.  That's Joe.  Mid-thigh.  You don't like her knee?  Jimmy doesn't like her left knee.  How could you not like her knees?  Look at her stupid ringworm left knee.  There's nothing going on there.  Perhaps she was on one knee taking other photos on the beach.  And it, like, maybe made a mark on it or something.  I would...  Oh, I would, too.  After you did.  That's saying a lot.  Yes.  And then I would do it again.  After you.  Swap and spit. 
[00:08:30]  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  How do you do, Joe?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  What do you got today, buddy?  I want to do the first on-air suicide.  All right.  What's the matter, Joe?  What?  It's too early for this shit.  Before Christmas, got laid off.  And?  Look.  What's the problem?  Going to get evicted right before the holidays.  Nah.  How long have they given you a warning for?  You could stay there for quite a while. 
[00:09:00]  I haven't paid rent in, like, three months.  Why?  Why?  What's the matter?  Why?  No work.  Oh, okay.  What kind of job do you have?  Yeah, what do you do?  I deliver an office furniture.  I actually did your guys' studios, the whole building, McGraw-Hill.  You're done?  Wait, what do you do?  He works here.  Office furniture.  Office furniture?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He did this building and all in McGraw-Hill.  So how long have you been out without a job? 
[00:09:30]  What happened?  Well, you were talking about naked girls.  Oh.  Joe's depressed.  What a fucking U-turn we just made.  Joe, you got a Twitter account.  I'm ready to kill myself for not being able to lick this girl's pussy.  It's gorgeous.  Joe, you got a Twitter account?  Yeah.  All right.  You go to I Like Girls Daily, and I don't think you're going to want to kill yourself anymore.  There you go.  There's beautiful girls out there.  Beautiful girls?  Yeah.  Well, how long have you been without a job, Joe?  It's been like four months now.  All right.  Well, that sucks.  It's a rough economy, but you can't just off yourself. 
[00:10:00]  Are you married, kids?  Uh, fiance.  Okay.  Unemployment?  Yeah.  It doesn't really...  It's not even half.  You're single?  You ain't got kids?  That's...  Unemployment could cut it.  You're still eating.  You've got a roof over your head, right?  Not for long.  Come on.  How could you not afford a place on unemployment?  You get something, right?  Yeah.  It might be enough to get like a fine ice cardboard box. 
[00:10:30]  No, it's just temporary, Joe.  You can't off yourself.  You can't do it.  You're going to leave your fiancee holding the bag and ruin the rest of her life?  That's terrible, dude.  You can't do that.  Family all pissed and all sad because you killed yourself.  That's crazy.  Yeah, that's what ends up happening.  I know.  It's selfish.  It's very selfish.  Suicide is painless, right?  You know?  Yeah, it brings on many changes.  It sure does.  Isn't that the mash?  It doesn't hurt.  Yes, sir.  Very, very good, sir.  Very good, sir.  Isn't that the mash?  Well, yes. 
[00:11:00]  It really is, though.  I mean, truer words have never been sung because it's not about you in the end.  When you kill yourself, you don't know the difference.  And then everyone left behind is fucking miserable for the rest of their lives.  What an ass.  What?  No, no.  I was looking at the girl.  I swear.  I'm sorry, sir.  I wasn't talking to you.  I was again looking at the lovely girl on the beach and saying, what an ass.  Yeah, the fat knees.  Oh, I would fucking suck on her fat knees and lick up into her vagina hole.  And then her bone.  Her duty hole.  The hole that the duty comes in. 
[00:11:30]  The cocky hole.  We're talking to a guy that's...  Oh, I'm sorry, sir.  Joe, what were you thinking of doing?  What are you thinking?  Joe?  I'm sorry, Joe?  What do you mean?  The way to go?  Yeah, yeah.  What are you thinking?  Are you taking pills or something?  What's going on?  Yeah, pills will do it.  Well, I would suggest you don't do that.  What do you got in the house?  Don't show her knees.  Makes Jimmy upset.  What do you got in the house?  What kind of drugs?  At 7 p.m.  No, I don't think that's... 
[00:12:00]  Look.  All right.  Look, look.  Hey, hey, hey.  Come on.  Hey, Janis Joplin.  Look.  That ain't gonna cut it.  You take enough p.m.  It'll do some damage.  No, he's just gonna get a tummy ache.  You sure that's what ends up happening?  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't do it.  What changed from yesterday when you didn't kill yourself to today when you want to kill  yourself?  That's a good question.  Yeah, of course it is.  I mean, yes, sir. 
[00:12:30]  Anything?  I don't know.  It's just a next day to think about things.  Exactly.  And you know what?  From today till tomorrow, you got another day to think about things and maybe your frame  of mind changes again.  You know?  The whole suicide thing is pretty...  That's like a period right at the end.  There's not much after that.  So you just keep going.  And then the next day leads into the next and then you go, oh, shit, I got a job. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, look at me.  And then you work and you make some money.  You do all right.  And what we're trying to say here is suicide is pretty stupid because it's like the end  of the whole thing.  You know?  Yeah, if I lost everything, I would still go to the Caribbean or something and be homeless.  Yeah.  Right.  I'm not even joking.  You might as well go to the Caribbean and be homeless there or something.  Or here's the ultimate last ditch effort.  Find a nice beach in Florida if you can't afford the trip to Nassau. 
[00:13:30]  I know some people got mental problems where they want to kill themselves because of some  kind of mental thing and it can't be fixed with drugs or anything else.  But if you're going to kill yourself because of financial reasons or anything like that,  I always thought, like, why not just take the opportunity to rob a bank?  Because if you get killed in the interim, then you might as well have just killed yourself.  But if you don't, then your financial problems are solved.  We're trying to set some type of world record. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah?  Some incredibly dangerous world record.  Right.  At least try.  Do something like that.  How about you go to Afghanistan and play Call of Duty in real life?  Would that be fun?  Is there some incredibly dangerous world records that need to be set?  How deep you could swim underwater?  Yeah.  Imagine just you keep swimming down, down, and you're out of breath and you're like,  and you keep going down and down.  At least you died trying to do something cool.  Wow, that would be horrible, by the way.  Imagine how horrible that would be. 
[00:14:30]  As you're rushing back up and you realize your air has left already.  You just have nothing.  And you can't rush back up.  How about your air is nothing and you're still swimming down?  Like, that's crazy.  And they do it.  Why don't you do that?  You can't rush back up.  The diver's out there, no.  You got to take your time.  You got to take your time.  You got to take your time.  You get the bends.  What about that, Joe?  What do you think?  Yeah, it's way better than XMPM, I think.  I would get a ramp and try to jump something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something cool, though.  Bungie jump with thread. 
[00:15:00]  With thread.  Maybe I could do 14 garbage cans in Arnold's parking lot.  Yeah, there you go.  All right, there.  See, he's joking.  He's joking.  That's socked.  I just don't think that, even though you're sad, I don't know why, that Fonzie has to  be the butt of a joke when he did actually do the jump, Joe, and it was frightening for  all of us.  Killing yourself is one thing.  Don't joke about Fonzie, okay?  Yeah, sadness is one thing, but there's no reason to drag Arthur Fonzarelli into it.  Arthur Fonzarelli.  Yes, the great Fonz. 
[00:15:30]  Can we get back to Naked Girls, Joe?  I want to make sure Joe's all right.  You're all right, Joe?  You're all right, Joe?  You're all right?  Hey, look, look, you're going to hang in and call us Monday?  I'll call you.  I'll try to.  Yeah, I'll call you.  Don't try.  Call us.  Just hang in there and call us Monday.  Hey, shithead.  Call us Monday, okay?  Because we don't have time to deal with you all day today, because it's Friday.  But Monday, we'll put up with your pain in the acidness and deal with you, okay?  Plus, it would make for a sleepless weekend.  Yeah.  You're dead, and now we're in bed thinking, fuck, did we do the right thing? 
[00:16:00]  What should we have told this guy?  Yeah, do you know what you just put us into, you fucking selfish shithead?  Right, now we're involved.  Yeah.  We can't say what we want to say, which is jump.  Right, now we're involved, and now I'm not even going to know.  I know.  All weekend, I'm going to wonder, did that guy off himself?  Should we have said something better?  How do you think I feel?  How are we involved with your shit now, Joe?  Exactly.  With guilt.  I'm supposed to feel good, because three out of my four shows are sold out this weekend. 
[00:16:30]  Three out of your four?  Where, Jimmy?  And the Doylestown Comedy Cabaret.  There's a 7 o'clock availability, but not much, and I'm going to feel guilty about that,  Joe, because you're dead.  You can't have it, Joe.  Now the listeners, they're getting together at FH Riley's this weekend.  Now they're all going to be wondering.  Yeah.  And they're not going to be spending as much, because they're going to be a little down in  the dumps over Joe in Jersey.  And Joe's probably wondering where FH Riley's is.  400 New York Avenue.  Yeah.  See?  There's controversy, though.  Oh.  I guess.  Does that cut when they move the building?  Hold on, Joe. 
[00:17:00]  I guess the gang want a karaoke machine for what?  Tomorrow night's the big party.  You going?  Dude, if there's a karaoke machine, I'm there.  And I guess Brett hasn't returned any of their calls.  He's just like me.  What is wrong with him?  No, what's wrong with our family?  I'll go if there's karaoke.  I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.  But the pest won a karaoke machine.  The pest will get a karaoke machine.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Can we get the one from your compound and just drag it over to FH?  Yeah, that's a big unit right there. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, Joe's going to kill himself.  Oh, Joe, Joe.  How are you doing?  We've got problems, too, Joe.  See?  Yeah, Joe.  We've got problems.  You're not the only one.  Why don't you go to the FH Riley's party?  You want to go?  Where do you live?  By the way, can I say one other thing about FH Riley's and it involves one of our friends?  Rob Bartlett writes me yesterday.  He goes.  That fucking guy.  Oh, I mean.  He goes, I just left FH Riley's and this is going to sound like a self-serving plug.  Shameless.  He goes, the macaroni and cheese and the skirt steak could be one of the best things I've ever consumed in my life. 
[00:18:00]  I've had both.  But.  Fantastic.  The point being, and thanks for that, Rob.  And I go, why the fuck didn't you tell me you were going there so we could set you up nice?  Set up Rob nice with a table.  He's.  And he goes, I'm not that type of guy.  And then I'm thinking, well, I'm that type of guy.  And I just asked you for Broadway tickets.  He's a stand up guy.  That's what he basically said to me.  Like, I'm not that type of guy.  But obviously you are because you fucking hit me up for tickets recently. 
[00:18:30]  Bartlett's a stand up guy.  He'll just he'll just go not tell anybody anything and enjoy like a layman.  You should have responded to Bartlett with your story about going to Caroline's and telling the kid at the door.  He should know who you are.  I was just in a bedroom.  That's a little embarrassing.  And that was the last time I saw Patrice O'Neill, which makes that story.  Oh, yeah.  But and then Rob goes, no, I, you know, I played hooky for my play.  Maybe you shouldn't.  I shouldn't be saying this.  And I brought my son's to FH Riley's and to see Cheap Trick at that theater. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  Have you driven by the new theater?  No.  It's like literally a half a block down from the restaurant.  Holy fuck.  Dude, they're getting relaxed in there.  Really?  Cheap Trick.  That's pretty huge.  I know it's 2011, but it's Cheap Trick.  But Rob Bartlett wouldn't fucking tell anyone he was going there.  That's a stand up guy right there.  But I'm not.  I think you are.  I hit him up for tickets.  I can't.  I can't give him a free plate of fucking macaroni. 
[00:19:30]  Broadway tickets are harder to get than macaroni.  Oh, Joe, what's up?  Yeah, Joe.  Joe, are you hanging in there?  I'm hanging in if you guys take my call on Monday.  Oh, see, now we're now we're committed to this.  Yeah, we'll take your call.  What about counseling?  Is there anyone in your family you could talk to?  Yeah, what happened?  What about your fiance?  It seems like you like her.  Yeah, it's just that, you know, the fear of letting her down, being evicted.  Well, you're going to let her down by killing yourself, obviously. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, you'll ruin her life, dude.  Yeah, that's who.  If you get evicted, she might kill me.  Well, at least that way she's ruining her own life.  Yeah, at least she decides that.  You can't kill yourself, man.  Because it's the people that you leave behind that fucking stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, I think it's, wow, we're probably talking to people that this is too close to home, but I think suicide is very selfish.  It is very selfish.  Because, you know, you're just gone, and then everybody else is like, and then there's like weeks. 
[00:20:30]  People say it's selfish, but where are those people in the time of need?  Oh, yeah, good point, good point.  Maybe.  Well, you've got to reach out to them.  Sometimes they don't even know, and that's the problem.  Secondly, if you do kill yourself, make sure you don't leave a messy body behind, because that is extremely selfish.  And what you're just saying is right there, you're doing it for the wrong reasons.  You're saying, where were they in your time of need?  You can't kill yourself to punish other people.  That's a really harsh form of punishing other people, man.  No, no, it's not to punish other people, but the defense to not do it can't be, well, you leave those people behind. 
[00:21:00]  No, it can't be.  You know what?  You want to go real with this, Joe?  We're going to go real with this.  I'm going with Mr. Good Zoo, I think.  Mr. Good Zoo, you've got Joe and Jersey on the line.  Well, what's up?  Hey.  All right.  Come on, man.  How are you going to kill yourself?  I mean, I lost my arm in the fucking war.  I can't button my pants. 
[00:21:30]  I can't button my shirt.  I can't pop a fucking blackhead.  You can't pop a blackhead?  With one arm, you really can't.  Why not?  I would do it with the thumb and the index finger, no?  Yeah, well, that's true.  That's how I do it.  Joe goes, that's how I do it.  Joe's like, yeah.  Wait, the blackhead might have talked some sense into Joe.  Yeah, they fucking keep piling up.  Get the fuck out of here.  You got the O.P.A. and Anthony's show.  Oh, boy. 
[00:22:00]  Now he's really going to kill himself.  Don't kill yourself, man.  Hey, war guy, what arm did you lose?  I lost my right arm.  Thank God I'd whack off and lose my left arm.  Ah.  I feel like someone else.  But were you a righty?  I was a lefty.  I was a righty with everything else, though.  Right.  What happened?  How'd you lose that?  Uh, IED.  Oh, those fucking things. 
[00:22:30]  Goddamn savages.  Jesus Christ.  Sorry.  That's all right.  In the military.  Sorry to hear that.  I assumed you weren't just driving down Jericho Turnpike.  Yeah, exactly.  And IED went off.  I assumed it was the military.  And wine dance.  Yeah, it could.  Actually, it could in some areas.  Sure.  Malvern.  Yeah.  Shirley.  War guy, what do you do for a living now?  I actually do voiceover, but I tried to get into radio in 2007.  Oh, my God. 
[00:23:00]  That could be the worst time to try to get into radio.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  If I had to pinpoint the worst time to get into radio, I think I would say 2007.  It's like opening a sushi place in 1942.  Right.  I mean, I think in the coming year or two, there's going to be some big options.  I think it's finally turning around a little bit.  Not regular radio, obviously, but the podcasting and whatnot.  Yeah.  But 2007, fuck no.  In 2007, I decided to go back to school for broadcasting. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  I went back to school and got a master's.  I got another degree.  I got a bachelor's in broadcasting.  And by the time I got it, about 2008, everything was great in 2007, and it just died.  So I'm doing voiceover now.  Please don't say die while Joe's on the phone.  Yeah.  Please.  Well.  Hey, Joe, you hear this guy laughing?  His life doesn't sound that great right now, but he's making the best of it. 
[00:24:00]  My life sucks.  I don't want to laugh, because you're a fucking war hero, sir.  There's a lot of great stuff.  Yeah, I love your show every day.  You know, every day is a good day, man.  I mean, I can't even butt my pants, but, you know, there's a lot of great shit.  Well, how do you wear a lot of sweatpants, or does your dick just flop out?  Yeah, I was thinking.  What decision do you make, sir?  Yeah, I don't have any pants with buttons. 
[00:24:30]  Dude, I don't get the war hero, because I know I can button my pants with one hand.  Yeah.  Maybe he likes button flies.  What's wrong with the other hand?  Can you?  Yeah, it wouldn't be easy, but.  That's rough.  I mean, yeah.  What's that?  It takes a long time.  I mean, it's tough.  Yeah, he's not kidding about that.  I'm trying to do it right now.  That is tough.  Well, please, please button them.  I like a man with buttoned trousers.  I did it, though.  With my left hand, too. 
[00:25:00]  I'm a war hero.  Why aren't you a war hero, sir?  I think you are.  Well, I'm in Maryland, and everybody either worked for, I didn't really, I worked for,  I worked for the Department of State.  But if the VA gave me as many pain meds as they gave him, I probably wouldn't be thinking  about it.  You got some pain meds in you there, sir?  No. 
[00:25:30]  Not really.  I don't like to fuck with that shit.  Sounds like Dennis Hopper.  Yeah.  What are they going to say?  He was a wise man?  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks to the war guy.  I really appreciate it.  Hey, it's great.  He didn't help too much.  Huh?  He didn't help too much.  He has one arm.  I'm not sure myself listening to him.  All right, Joe.  A lot of people with shitty lives want to talk to you.  Yeah.  It's three of them right now on the air.  Four if you count.  Oh, this guy's freaking out over Joe.  Steve on Long Island, what do you got? 
[00:26:00]  Yes.  Oh, God.  I'm fucking high as a kite.  I'm listening to both sides.  It's fucking funny humor and shit.  And now it's fucking just grim suicide on the other side.  I'm like, fuck.  I can't.  I'm fucking.  If I was sober, I'd be fine.  But my fucking emotions are out of the fuck control right now.  Well, we started.  Holy shit.  We started off the show nice for everyone.  Yeah, we had a nice hot blonde completely nude on a Caribbean beach, it looks like, near 
[00:26:30]  the water.  Look at this.  A young Pamela Anderson lookalike.  And now we're dealing with suicide.  Bringwormknees.com.  I was trying to Google it.  I was trying to Google the titties you were talking about, and then suicide.  Suicide.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  And now we got Steve High as a kite.  Fuck.  I swear to God.  All right, dude.  You on the line?  What, Joe?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Does your girlfriend fucking love you?  Yeah, she does. 
[00:27:00]  How often do you see her?  Every day.  Every day?  Do you talk to her?  Every day.  Do you tell her everything?  Uh, no, I keep the bills.  I like to be the one to worry about things, you know?  I don't want to, I don't want to.  I know, that's not how a relationship works, bro.  You gotta fucking tell her.  If she loves you, then she'll understand.  Maybe you can work through it together.  But if you don't, then just, if you don't think she loves you, um, find somebody else. 
[00:27:30]  Walk the fuck away.  Because you gotta fucking tell her, dude.  Yeah, she's gotta be in on this, unfortunately.  I'd care if I wasn't looking at fucking girl parts.  Yeah.  Sam's just going through a lot of stuff here.  They're pretty.  Yes.  Kim from Tampa writes, come on, it's Friday, at least wait until the weekend is over.  Monday's a much better day to kill yourself.  Cha.  Kind of true.  You make it to Friday, and you do it on a Friday?  Yeah.  That doesn't make sense.  Monday is like, it's usually Tuesday. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, man, you fucking, you know, have some fun.  Get some, get some fucking beers in you.  Yeah.  Well, no.  All right, Steve, take care of that buzz of yours.  Fucking try.  I have to listen to this and stay up now, you fucks.  All right.  Let's go to John.  John.  Hey, John.  Hello.  Speak and be spoken to.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, I'm a father of three, and I'm a truck driver.  I bought my own truck, well, regular four fuel jumped up way high. 
[00:28:30]  I lost everything when I lost my transmission.  I was $20,000 behind, got out of taxes, and IRS, came to take everything, left with some clothes,  and had to move my kids in with my mother-in-law for like three years.  But it's been nine years now.  I've slowly worked back and gotten everything back.  Yeah, I mean, we're talking, we lost the car, house, everything. 
[00:29:00]  It gets better, brother.  You just got to wake up every day and keep pushing on.  Geez.  If you called with that, we would have actually said you should kill yourself.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I went and grabbed the pill bottle.  All right.  One more phone call for Needy, and then we got to move on.  Yeah.  Robin in Atlanta.  Go ahead, Robin.  Listen to this one.  Hey, I had a son.  His name was Tommy.  He was awesome.  But when he was six, we found out he had a brain tumor. 
[00:29:30]  And he died 10 months later.  Ah.  And it's five years later, and now I have breast cancer.  Oh, my God.  Stop.  I'm not killing myself.  I mean, you just move on.  Who were you last life?  Hitler?  I feel like it.  Jesus.  One more thing.  What did you do to God, man?  Yeah.  What did you do to God?  I don't know what I did to God.  What the fuck, dude?  Do you have faith in the Lord, Jesus?  Most of the time.  Oh, man.  How? 
[00:30:00]  There's not really another choice to me.  That is not an option for me.  Right.  You know, it's not an option to off myself because I can't do that based on the people that are left in my life.  And the fact that I had this son who I would have traded places with.  Yeah.  You'd probably be dead soon anyway.  I'm a little bit more years too late to trade places, but it's the same principle.  You just can't do that.  I'm sorry.  I'm talking over you.  No, no.  That's fine.  No, she's pissed.  Robin is pissed.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  That's it. 
[00:30:30]  So, yeah, the breast cancer, huh?  Mm-hmm.  You all right now?  I have it right now.  I had a lumpectomy, the surgery, a couple weeks ago.  I'm going to do my first oncology appointment today.  Yeah?  How's it working out?  Hopefully, I'm good.  Yeah?  Oh, you had a lumpectomy?  That, yeah.  You didn't have to have the whole thing cut off, right?  Not yet.  Well, that's nice.  Well, that's kind of cool.  She used the first caller on his left side with her right side. 
[00:31:00]  I'm a lefty.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  She's just talking over people.  Why don't you just...  Oh.  That's all.  Joe, don't do it.  It gets better.  It's probably going to be better tomorrow.  Those tits.  Yeah.  No offense.  Tomorrow will be better.  I know.  Sorry.  I'm looking at a girl with voluptuous, lovely breasts on the computer screen.  Kind of an awkward time to look at perfect foods as Robin is spilling her guts out here.  Here's what you do.  You ever stand by the edge of a mirror and you put the middle of your body next to it 
[00:31:30]  and then you just look at it and it's a mirror image and it...  What the hell's wrong with you?  What?  You ever do that, though?  No.  What the hell's wrong with you?  You ever do that in a mirror and it kind of looks...  No?  I'm sorry.  Oh, Jimmy, I'm sorry.  What's wrong with you?  I was just thinking what it would...  Because I've done that before.  What is wrong with you?  And try to see what it looks like when you...  Oh, boy.  You ever put a mirror right down your nose and the center of your body and you look...  Oh, boy.  No?  No.  Not recently.  All right.  I'm sorry, then.  I'm sorry.  That's okay. 
[00:32:00]  It's a standalone mirror.  Well, you guys have a good day.  All right, Robin.  Thanks for calling the show.  No problem.  Sorry you didn't get a little more sympathy than you did.  All right.  I didn't expect sympathy.  No, no.  You have...  I was on the wrong show.  Have a great weekend, man.  You're a good egg.  I like her good nature, considering that God gave her a fucking weird hand.  Oh, what a lousy hand that is.  You got...  What kind of hand is that?  Seven-deuce offsuit.  Seven-deuce offsuit?  Seven-deuce offsuit with a fucking colorful flop. 
[00:32:30]  One joker.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Good luck playing those cards, Robin.  One joker.  All right.  Well, you guys have a great weekend.  All right.  All right.  Damn it.  Ace of spades.  Ace of spades.  Get on with the show.  Jimmy, you're my hero.  Why does an aunt like being serious ever?  That lady lost her kid and has breast cancer.  I was serious once.  Everyone left.  When?  I think that was a Hawkeye line.  Try to be serious once.  Everyone left.  What episode?  I don't know.  One of the eight million MASH episodes, Jimmy. 
[00:33:00]  My favorite MASH is when he runs in and he goes, there's blood everywhere.  And it's like, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And it made, I was like, choppers.  It's like, we're having a party.  Good things.  Good things.  Good things.  Choppers.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Kind of was the same show.  Don't let the bastard win.  Don't let the bastards win.  Does she?  But Robin makes you so uncomfortable, you just can't go with it on that level. 
[00:33:30]  Opie, you've known me for how many years?  It just makes you very uncomfortable, though.  You know that I can't deal with serious shit like this.  That's, yeah.  When I'm home or.  Oh, I just, I think I just hung up on Joe because Robin was so uncomfortable.  Joe said goodbye, I think.  Oh, did Joe say goodbye?  I think, I think he did.  Please tell me he did.  Maybe he'll hang up on everybody this weekend.  I don't know.  But when you hear that.  Joe was here on a fucking beam.  You hear that morbid shit, you just can't go there, huh?  Uh, not on the radio. 
[00:34:00]  Alone, I, I can, I can fucking, I can work some emotion when I'm alone, to tell you the  truth.  But, uh, doing this radio show, Jimmy Norton, Greg Opie Hughes, uh, flanking me like this,  uh, looking at Sam, I'm watching a black midget woman get fucked silly on my computer  during the show.  It's kind of hard to actually, you know, give a fuck that emotion or as you say, give  a fuck about a human being. 
[00:34:30]  Very true.  I understand we shouldn't take too many of those calls cause it'll bum everyone out.  But every once in a while we get stuck, uh, taking a call like that.  That's a nice little henna head right there.  Fucking hate redheads.  Oh, sorry.  Do you?  Yes.  I kind of like redheads.  Uh, I was never a fan.  I don't like that.  I don't like the, the bozo red.  Sorry to the redheads.  I don't like bozo redhead, but strawberry blondes and.  But bozo redhead never was a fan.  Shit like that.  And I'd like to see, uh, redheads I think are allowed to have a little bush there.  You know, I like the girl shaved and, and stuff. 
[00:35:00]  A little red bush.  I want my little red bush because it's so unique.  It's like, ooh, a little fire down below.  Yeah.  I like her to have, uh, you know, a little wig down there and her haymaker.  Guys who have expressions.  Haymaker?  Whatever.  Haymaker?  Just guys who have awful expressions for it, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  I like when she's got a little red cream on her coffee cup.  What?  What does that even mean?  I don't know.  It means nothing.  I like when she's got a big lipstick mark there on her lid.  Yeah.  Like an Eli Whitney's cotton gin right down there.  What?  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  We got Robin in Detroit.  She's a regular to the show.  Robin?  Another Robin?  Yeah.  I thought the other Robin was this Robin, but it turned out to be a different Robin.  Yeah.  You're ripping her off.  We like the Robins.  Oh, a little red back.  What I was just calling to say to Joe is that my brother killed himself two years ago, and  you have to really think about, you know, the people that you leave behind and how much  you fuck their lives up, you fuck their lives up, you fuck their lives up.  I mean, when, you know, his daughter finds him, she'll never be the same, but, you know, 
[00:36:00]  someone's going to find him, and you just have to, you have to think about that night.  How the fuck did he do it?  He slid his throat.  What?  And then the daughter finds him?  Slid his throat?  That's a rough way to go, man.  That's a ballsy move.  Your brother had problems, man.  That's a ballsy move.  How would you allow your daughter to find that shit, or the possibility that she would?  Well, the worst thing is that she found him.  He had gone to a secluded area.  She found him, and they did call 911, and he was alive. 
[00:36:30]  What is a secluded area in your own fucking world?  Yeah, and they did surgery on him, and when we left the hospital that night, they said  that he would, that they thought that he would be fine, and then something happened  during the night, and he died.  Yeah, he probably, like, threw himself off the bed a few times.  Yeah, I don't know, but...  Wait, they did surgery on his neck, and then he died?  They did, because, you know, when you, he, he cut his juggler vein, which I found out  you can, you can still survive without...  We were looking at tits. 
[00:37:00]  I know, I know, I know.  We were looking at tits.  We decided to go light today, like, let's start the show looking at boobies, and...  Let's just keep it nice and loose and fun for everyone, and now we're in this hell.  He cut his juggler vein?  What I want to tell Joe is that, you know...  Wow.  Imagine what you do to a family.  Jesus.  Holy shit, no shit, right?  Wow, those are fucking beautiful tits.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry, we were just perusing a little more photos from, uh... 
[00:37:30]  Which one's the jugular, by the way?  I like girls daily.  The big ones on each side.  On each side?  Yeah.  So how do you cut through that shit?  Wow.  Okay, it does.  Yeah, boy.  Yeah, but how do you do it if you're killing yourself?  Just jab your knife in and rip?  Ow!  Jesus.  Well, like I said, he has to think, I know at this point it's all about him, but I think  he has to think about these other people.  Yeah, yes, yes.  I mean, if you're going to kill yourself, like, when you look at tits like this, if someone  says, like, I'm going to suck these tits to death, like, until I just die, I'm going 
[00:38:00]  to suck these tits.  That's a fair way to go.  It's tits.  Yeah.  And the only thing that we look at is that, you know, he donated organs, he saved five  lives, so that's the only thing...  Oh, okay.  That's good.  That's good.  I'm just saying, you know, we hold on to that, but we'll never have him back.  Oh.  And I think if he would have just sucked it out, things would have changed, but at that moment  he couldn't do it.  Yeah, that stinks.  That stinks.  Wow.  Holy.  All right.  Tell Joe to, you know...  People are selfish.  Wow, Robin. 
[00:38:30]  Thank you, brother.  It wasn't opening, Anthony.  They always cheer me up.  Yeah, we do that, especially today with this fucking diet.  Yeah, we're going to turn this thing around.  My God.  We're going to turn this around.  We're going to turn this fucking thing around.  Keep your chin up.  Don't even look at the phone, Zamp, because it'll depress the hell out of you.  Is it depressing?  These people want to fucking talk.  Because what you do when you kill yourself, and I know a lot of people that have done  it, and what happens is people...  You've known a lot of people that have killed themselves.  Tremendous amount, yeah.  Why is that, Jimmy?  I think I know at least six comics. 
[00:39:00]  I've talked about this on the air before.  Oh, I know.  Real funny.  People who are sober.  Oof.  You know, just whatever, just close friends.  But it is what it is.  But people are left behind, like, oh, if I would have found that one thing to say, it's  like...  No.  That's what you do to people when you do that.  It's fucking awful.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Obviously, you can't think that, because...  But it's just a natural inclination.  Yeah, you're gonna, but...  You think of your interaction with them, the last argument you had, or the last thing,  you're like, oh, yeah, that was weird.  When you go, why don't you kill yourself?  Yeah, when you said, here's a rope. 
[00:39:30]  What's your hurry?  But I remember this one guy I knew who hung himself.  He's a comic named Dave in Delaware.  Really nice guy.  But I would look back to all of our times we would hang out, and be like, yeah, he kind  of was on the outside.  Like, he was a little...  And nobody made him do it.  He found his, like, his niece or something overdosed on drugs, and he was very close to  her, and he just hung himself off the banister.  Oh!  It was awful.  But it's like, you hear that, and you're like, ugh, I wish I would have been a better  friend to him, or better whatever, you know?  Yeah.  Not that it would have stopped it. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  It's all about clearing our own conscience, let's be honest.  Sure.  Yeah, that's what it...  Once they're gone, it just becomes, you know, you trying to fucking deal with it.  Yeah.  And not...  Well, I think that's the hard part, is that...  Sorry, I was talking, but fuck me.  I'm sorry, but...  Fuck me running.  It's being...  What?  It's like Jimmy said...  Well, she's an expert on suicide.  Apparently, she's an expert on everything, uh, Opie.  I think the hard part of the people you behind is you feel like...  All those people feel like, if only I would have done something.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, it's not like somebody died in an accident or was sick. 
[00:40:30]  Like Jimmy said, what if I would have been able to be the one person that could have  talked them out of it?  Right.  That's all we do.  That's what we do.  And my conscience is, uh, clear.  When they called and said, look, I'm gonna kill myself, like, Opie, I was probably wrong  to say, I'm jerking off to cuck porn.  Right.  Unplayed.com.  Unplayed.com.  Get back to me.  Yeah.  Yeah, give me a few hours.  I'll get back to you.  Yeah.  But you guys have to talk about serious stuff every once in a while.  I don't mind.  No, we'll get over it until Monday and we'll all be happy. 
[00:41:00]  No.  We're gonna turn this thing around next break.  Fuck this way until Monday.  Yes.  Exactly.  I'm not gonna kill myself by not eating.  It's egg time.  Friday.  Friday.  You know, it's Friday.  All right, Rob.  You guys rule.  Have a great weekend.  Thanks, Rob.  Of course we do.  See you later.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Jesus.  There's suicide people all over the fucking place now.  Yeah.  God.  They all want to talk.  Finding brains all over the kitchen and a mom had to clean that up.  What the hell happened?  Oh, wow. 
[00:41:30]  What the hell happened?  My friend shot himself in front of his mother.  Oh, in front of his mother?  Yeah, with a rifle.  That's insanity.  I think it was either a rifle or a shotgun.  What did she do to him?  I don't know if they were.  He was like, I'm 43.  He might have been 28.  I'm guessing.  You think she actually did something to him where he wanted to do this in front of her?  I don't know.  Or if he had substance abuse problems, which I think he did.  Right.  I don't know what was happening.  He was married, but he was at his mom's house.  And I don't know what drove him to do that.  Like, I don't know what he was doing, but he said he shot himself. 
[00:42:00]  Someone said it was in front of her.  Maybe they were fighting and she was.  Who knows?  I just don't know.  That's just fucking horrible.  Yeah.  Thanks, Joe.  Yeah.  Thanks, Joe.  We really appreciate the start of today's show.  Is Tom still alive?  People are wanting to know.  Oh, yeah.  Not big, heavy chest.  What?  Oh, yeah.  He couldn't breathe.  Concrete lungs.  Concrete lungs.  Yeah.  We used to do a bit called Is Tom Alive Friday?  And then the damn guy had lived so fucking long. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, he ruined the bit.  We couldn't do the bit anymore.  He ruined the bit by not dropping dead.  We just couldn't do it anymore.  I don't know if he's still alive.  No idea.  It's been a couple of years easy since we've talked to him, right?  Yeah.  Tom, you alive?  Give us a call.  We'll recognize your voice.  That's for sure.  Oh, my God.  That wheezing voice.  I would bet money's still alive.  Probably.  What do you want?  All right.  There's rumors that I can't get in on that.  F.H.  Where are the rumors?  Who's the...  Where are the rumors that you can't be... 
[00:43:00]  What is going on with you?  What do you mean there's rumors you can't go to F.H. Rileys for the big get-together  that...  Who's putting it together there?  Newsday?  Is it...  Who is it?  Newsday Laura?  Newsday Laura?  She does that every year for us, son.  I was sure to know when I'm working.  Are you going to throw up in Kurt Love's car?  No.  After you kiss?  Yeah.  After you kiss him?  I heard you're in a relationship with that man.  What?  You're very draining in your self-obsession. 
[00:43:30]  Yes!  Your self-obsession is draining.  We understand you don't have a complete brain, but you certainly have enough to fucking think  a lot about yourself.  Where are these rumors starting?  Bubba, what happened?  Like, people are talking about killing themselves.  I want to hear...  Yeah, exactly.  And this blithering idiot.  This blithering, doddering idiot.  Decided this was the perfect time to call the show. 
[00:44:00]  This is when he should call up and go...  There's rumors that I can't go to that man.  I can't...  I'm falling for the same thing.  Jimmy was just talking about a guy that shot himself in front of his mother.  That's right.  Now we're hearing from someone who should have...  You know what?  I think I should be the next phone call on the show.  This makes sense.  You're just disconnected from what everybody else is doing.  Always.  What are the rumors, Bobo?  No, they couldn't get in at the... 
[00:44:30]  Who said that?  Like, what...  What idiocy is this?  What bouncer?  We might have a bouncer Saturday because it's a special event, but we don't have bouncers  at FH.  What are you talking about?  Who started the rumor?  Who said you couldn't get in?  A bunch of people on Twitter.  Really?  How about...  How about the people on Twitter have nothing to do with who's allowed in or not in to  a restaurant that is owned by Opie's brother? 
[00:45:00]  And me.  And Opie, of course.  I probably own more, to be honest with you.  Probably.  Yeah.  Silent partner, though.  Silent.  Why are you so gullible?  Yeah.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, that's right.  He's retarded.  How's your dick?  You go to the doctor?  What did they say?  What did he say?  I got away from the results of another urine test on Monday.  What results?  What's the matter?  What's wrong?  Your bladder fucked up?  You know, if I was you, I would just cut off your dick and become a woman at this point.  That would be kind of cool. 
[00:45:30]  You might be better off making it to a vag, whatever's left.  Buh-buh.  Or that, yes.  Yeah.  I don't want that.  So, rumors have it you're not allowed into FH Reilly's.  And who's not going to allow you in there?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I've been hearing multiple sources.  Multiple sources?  He's like a secret agent.  He'd be a perfect politician.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Your sources?  I've been hearing multiple names.  I've been hearing multiple names. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, shut up.  What are you talking about?  Fucking idiots see this.  Hey, buddy.  The Twitter bouncer.  Multiple sources.  In a restaurant.  Rumors.  Multiple sources.  The guy's calling himself in the fucking...  He's standing on the Verrazano with cement shoes.  I love the duck and the same cheesecake.  I love these.  What the fuck do you think?  What's wrong with you?  Bobo, do you realize we were talking about suicide? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, I do.  So, any other normal fucking person would go, I really want to talk to the guys.  But you know what?  I'm starting to think this might not be the time.  So, I'm going to hang out my phone and try to get maybe to the guys later on in the show.  Right.  But you have decided that this would fit perfectly in between a mother that lost her six-year-old son to cancer.  Now she's got cancer.  And another guy that just said that somebody shot himself in front of his mother. 
[00:47:00]  We're going to squeeze you in the middle of this.  That fucking awful guttural noise you make is a segue back into you.  No matter what we're talking about, suicide, fucking hat thieves.  And you'll go, instead of addressing them, you'll go, back to you.  Multiple sources.  You don't listen to anything anyone says.  And it's all vague, man.  God.  He posted another dick pic on Twitter. 
[00:47:30]  Why did you post another dick picture?  No, because I thought I was one of the people that was trying to keep me from getting in.  So, you decide if I post a dick picture, then you're going to be allowed in FH.  For everyone to see, by the way.  Right.  You do know they're going to yank your Twitter account.  Yeah.  You dumb dumb.  You see the yank that his little dick.  I know.  It's awful.  His little fucking thimble dick.  Yeah, and I don't want people like you in FH.  I don't want people that are showing their chewed up dick on Twitter to be in my and my brother's fine establishment. 
[00:48:00]  What happened?  How did you post a dick pic to everyone on Twitter?  No, I was going to say if that's going to happen, then that was going to be my...  Hey, shithead.  How did you post a picture of your dick to everyone on Twitter?  Answer the question.  No, that person.  I was going to say that.  That person is going to get in trouble.  Why isn't he? 
[00:48:30]  Why did it go out to everyone on Twitter?  How did you explain?  You got our attention.  You're on our stupid show.  What are the rumors?  What are the multiple sources?  Why the dick picture?  Start explaining.  Go.  Well, the dick picture was to get revenge on that guy.  Right.  Well, revenge on that guy.  Oh, wow.  So you showed him.  You must have got him bad.  You're going to get your Twitter account yanked.  And they ask you about that.  Why did you post your dick picture?  Something else.  Revenge.  I needed revenge. 
[00:49:00]  You want to get revenge on him?  Call his radio show.  Right.  Exactly.  Yes.  Call him at work.  Bobo.  Yes?  Why?  What are the rumors?  What are the multiple sources?  What's going on?  Who?  Go.  Who?  They were saying that they couldn't come.  We know.  Who said it?  Oh, my God.  I don't know, Pete.  Sources were saying to his people.  Sources?  These sources.  You had to hear it from someone you know.  Who was it?  Go.  I don't know.  One of my friends, Mike. 
[00:49:30]  How do you not know?  You do know.  When are you going to realize that the entire Twitterverse just fucks with you?  How long is it going to take for you to figure it out?  Who was it?  Who?  Who?  Names.  Go.  Go.  No, one of my friends, Mike from Philly, was telling me that.  Mike from Philly.  Mike from Philly.  Mike.  Dumbbell.  From Philly.  And what did Mike from Philly say?  He was telling me it was Steve from Bayshore.  Steve from Bayshore.  What was Steve from Bayshore say? 
[00:50:00]  That I wasn't allowed in.  And I was saying, oh, you're going to need a disguise to get in.  Well, and then I, and this isn't a rumor.  A disguise?  See, unlike Bobo, I have facts.  Also, Bobo's on Twitter saying that he wants to fight Steven S. from Bayshore in our studio  and have Jerry Springer as the ref.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Who said that?  Bobo.  Did Bobo say that?  I don't follow him on Twitter.  Why would you?  I have him blocked.  But he actually said that?  Yes.  Did you say that, Bobo? 
[00:50:30]  Bobo, did you say that?  Yeah, because...  What do you think this is?  So you want us to stop our entire show so you can have a fight with Steven S. from Bayshore  and we've got to find Jerry Springer to be the referee, right?  Well, that was before when I thought it was it.  Do you think you could actually fight Steve from Bayshore and maybe win?  More importantly, you think we could get Jerry Springer to pay attention to this?  Well, Jerry probably would.  One look at Bobo and he'd be like, that's prime shit for my show.  How delusional are you?  Yeah.  Do you understand that there's real fucking people here? 
[00:51:00]  What do you think?  We're all actors in your play?  No.  Do you think you wrote a play and we're all playing parts?  It's just right now I just happened to just woke up not that far ago and I called in and  just had to be locked out.  We know you did because the more important thing was the FH Riley's bouncer, not that  there was somebody sitting there with a fucking shotgun with a toe attachment, depressed about  the holidays.  Right.  Yeah, right.  We'll talk to those people. 
[00:51:30]  So there's rumors, multiple sources.  We still haven't gotten any info out of you whatsoever.  Why would we?  Yeah.  Well, that's everything I know.  So why are you calling us?  Yeah.  I don't know because I figured that would fool everything.  That would solve everything.  It would solve the fake problem you have.  Like another fake problem that you just bought into.  You're going to be there, aren't you?  And I'm not wrecking it for anyone out there because I've told Bobo to his face on the radio 
[00:52:00]  probably ten times myself that everyone just fucks with him and he still can't comprehend  this.  He doesn't know.  He has no clue.  And I kind of figured that out last night.  Oh, you did?  Oh, so why are you calling us then?  So why are you calling saying that you're banned?  You know, because I wanted to be sure it wasn't the right.  Raise your hand if you're sure.  Because you're really...  So when you go to FH Riley's, we're going to just say you can't come in?  Yeah.  Bobo?  What's that? 
[00:52:30]  Bobo?  Bobo?  That's what I thought.  More importantly, Bobo, how's Mr. Maloon again?  That's great.  The dog is doing good.  The dog.  Don't call him the dog.  It's Mr. Maloon again.  Well, Mr. Maloon again is doing good right now.  Does he speak?  He just barks.  Well, make him bark.  Go speak, speak.  Make him bark.  Go ahead.  I want to hear Mr. Maloon again.  I can't grab him right there.  I'm sick.  What?  Yeah, we know you're sick.  So if you're sick, why are you even going FH Riley's? 
[00:53:00]  Exactly.  With your dumb little hands.  You're going to shake everybody's hands?  We don't want sick people there getting everyone else sick.  Anyone else would stay home if they were sick.  Bobo, what's your Christmas wish?  Bobo, shut up.  Bobo, shut up.  What's your Christmas wish?  Make him talk.  Oh, no.  He said for one of you three to visit me.  Wait, wait, wait.  Bobo.  Not if you were at Ozzy's house.  I wouldn't visit you if you were at the Osborne compound. 
[00:53:30]  What a shitty Christmas.  Your Christmas wish is to have one of us three visit you?  Where?  At your house?  No.  Now, let me ask you something.  Will your sister be home, Bobo?  Yes, she will be.  All right.  I would come and visit him if his sister's home.  How old is she?  She's 16.  All right.  There's nothing wrong with that.  And I've seen pictures of her, right? 
[00:54:00]  We've shown pictures.  She's kind of attractive.  Yeah.  She doesn't look like Bobo.  No.  Yeah.  Is she a half-sister?  Yeah.  Yeah, that must be the good half.  Let me see a picture of her.  Yeah.  Pop up a picture of Bobo's sister, who is sweet 16, as we like to call it.  It's still too young, though, right?  Oh, no.  In New York?  Oh, of course it is.  But I say no.  I'll find a state.  I'll find a state we could go to.  I'll be like Smoky and the Bandit with Coors. 
[00:54:30]  I'll drive to a state that's legal.  Yeah, because he's thirsty, dummy.  Let's see.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  There's the big Daniel Curlin Methead.  Fucking draining.  It really is.  Okay.  And there's the sister pick.  Oh, man.  Let's see.  That's the best I can do.  Oh, that's okay.  Won't she accept friend requests?  That's kind of nice.  Look, she's in shorts in her little Facebook picture. 
[00:55:00]  16.  She's got shorts, and she's doing like a Facebook sexy picture.  16 turns to 17.  When's her birthday, Bobo?  September.  September.  I mean, she just turned 16.  Well, that's fine.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Some states it's legal.  Is that her?  Oh, look at that gam.  Look at that gam right there, right?  Hello.  Sitting on the chain swing.  Oh, nice head of dark hair. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, man.  She's got a pinkish hue to her face.  A pinkish hue.  And her hair is flowing.  Yeah.  That picture was taken at a mall in Manhattan.  That's wonderful, Bobo.  At a mall?  I'd like to be that seat.  I'll tell you one thing.  I'd like to sniff that seat when she gets off of it, Bobo.  No, 16-year-old, it probably smells like farts.  Oh, no.  It smells like bubble gum, cotton candy, and homework. 
[00:56:00]  Hey, dope.  It smells like a school bag and erasers.  Hey, dope.  You realize Anthony's sexualizing your own sister, and you just sit there like a fucking idiot.  Yeah, I realize that.  You're a fucking idiot.  Oh, she's probably been laid before.  Let's stop it, really.  If she heard that.  What?  Yeah, she's been, like, not wanting to date anybody until after high school.  Why's your voice getting old?  She's not dating anybody?  Yeah, what, are you frustrated?  Can't go on a date with your half-sister?  You ever see her naked, Bobo? 
[00:56:30]  You ever see her naked?  No.  Why, you never sneak to peek?  No.  What's wrong with you?  My own sister, right?  I would do that.  See, I have sister.  It doesn't matter.  I've seen her turn down so many people.  Oh, yeah?  And it bothers you?  Why?  No.  No, it doesn't bother me.  I've heard the sister.  Oh, yeah, we do.  Oh, well.  Which one's Mr. Maloonigan's?  Why are we doing that?  The little curly Q dog?  Mr. Maloonigan's is adorable. 
[00:57:00]  Bobo, did we solve your dilemma?  Yeah, Bobo, how did we do?  We did.  We did.  We did.  How did we do?  We did.  You're a retard.  Now that we stopped the entire radio show for you once again.  Just for you.  Jimmy doesn't mind, though, right, Jimmy?  It's just draining.  You don't mind, though, right?  You understand.  Oh, God.  It's so stupid.  Bobo.  It's so stupid.  You're going to FH Riley's?  Yeah, I am.  I feel well with us tomorrow.  No.  Oh, well. 
[00:57:30]  Perish the thought you can't make it.  Yeah, we sure hope so, because it's not a party without you.  Please.  Please be well.  Be well.  Hey, Bobo.  Do you have any advice for Joe?  No.  Why would he?  That's another person.  Do you have advice for Joe?  That's another person.  With Joe.  Exactly.  Wow.  He was the guy that said he was going to kill himself while you were waiting to talk to us.  You heard it.  Well, all I can say is that stay strong and don't kill himself.  You should just stay strong.  That's the best I can say. 
[00:58:00]  The dumbest advice ever.  I had a friend of mine that tried to kill himself, and I stopped him.  I just told him to stay strong.  What did you hang up?  If you think you get better, you'll get...  And he just fucking fouls through us.  And he just fucking plows through.  Just plows through a great line.  Me, me, me.  God.  What's wrong with you?  Bobo.  Look at Bobo's titties in that picture.  That's fantastic. 
[00:58:30]  Bobo, what are you doing for your man boobs?  Yeah.  Bobo, coming?  I get man booby every once in a while.  Bobo's like...  And I just work a little harder at it.  What do you do for your man boobs?  Do you work out?  Sit up.  Sit up.  Sit ups for your...  Sit ups won't take care of your man boobs.  You'll have abs and tits.  Running in the backyard.  Running in the backyard.  You live in Queens.  Your backyard is a postage stamp.  That would be hilarious. 
[00:59:00]  It's a pretty wide enough space, believe me.  How is it?  How big is your backyard?  Who, you old yeller?  I don't know if it's big, but it's got enough space.  How many feet?  What?  Exactly.  Oh, God, Bobo.  He's running around in a tiny little backyard.  Yeah.  Bobo, go in the backyard and walk it off.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  Do one lap in your backyard for us right now, live on the phone.  Go ahead.  I bet you he has to do like 18,000 laps to equal a mile. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  What movie was that?  Easy Money?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Where they showed the wedding that they were having in the backyard in Queens.  You liked Easy Money?  I don't remember anymore.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  I might have to watch that.  It was pretty good.  Pesci and shit.  Danger field.  Yeah.  But that's how the backyard is.  It's like this little fucking fenced in postage stamp.  Oh, yeah.  It's Queens for you.  Is that little Bobo?  I'm in the backyard.  All right.  He's in the backyard.  Bobo, do one lap and we're going to time you, all right? 
[01:00:00]  Ready?  Set.  And go.  Jimmy.  One lap around it.  Are you done?  Yeah.  That was it?  No, but he was done before that.  Yeah.  I think if I have this right, one lap is five seconds.  Five seconds.  How are you going to get in shape to it in five seconds?  Bobo. 
[01:00:30]  You would get dizzy.  I don't know.  Shall we?  If you do that for a few minutes.  If you do that for five minutes.  Bobo, are you out of breath?  You ran for five, maybe six seconds.  No, I do that for five minutes a lot.  Do you know the people.  You're breathing heavy?  He's breathing heavy.  From one big lap around the yard.  One five to six seconds.  One lap around the compound.  I think it's not feeling well right now. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  You what?  That's why I'm not feeling well there right now.  You're not feeling well.  Oh, right.  He's sickly.  Oh, right.  So five seconds of running might be a problem.  I'm sickly.  Can you imagine his neighbors, like, around his house on the second floor just watching  this guy run around his backyard, holding his phone to his ear and running in the backyard?  I don't feel good.  Just when you thought this couldn't get any worse.  Jordan, go ahead.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, what are you doing? 
[01:01:30]  I ain't sick to knock you down.  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, Bobo.  What's wrong, Bobo?  They're not going to let you in the S.H. Riley's?  That's a pretty good impression.  That is a pretty good impression.  That's where it's decent.  Oh, no.  When are I going to get through the security?  Are they going to tase me?  Don't tase me, bro.  Don't tase me, bro.  I'm worried about that, you fake dummy.  Oh, shit. 
[01:02:00]  You know what?  He stands up.  I actually put Jordan on hold because we got the new Bobo on the line.  New Bobo?  You haven't heard about the new Bobo?  New Bobo.  New Bobo.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello.  What's up, new Bobo?  It's for the show.  Oh.  It's for the show.  I'm the new Bobo.  Yeah, you sound like an impersonation of me.  No, I'm the new Bobo.  These guys.  You sound like an impersonation of me.  I'm not lying.  It sounds like Bobo. 
[01:02:30]  You sound like a person.  Bobo.  We're going to go, Bobo.  Bobo?  We're going to go.  You got to go now.  You have a good day.  You have a good weekend.  Did he hang out?  Yeah.  It's his style.  Bobo?  No, he's done.  Oh, good.  He just hung up on himself.  Jimmy, you like when Bobo calls?  If Joe didn't kill himself over that call, he'll be fine.  We might have lost Joe.  He'll be fine. 
[01:03:00]  I don't mind when Bobo calls if there's some relevant reason.  When we're in the middle of talking about people killing themselves, and this goddamn fool picks up the phone to talk about getting into FH Riley's.  Yeah.  Because there's rumors.  Yeah.  Well, he doesn't.  From sources.  Dummy sending out his dick picture on Twitter.  What an idiot.  As revenge.  That was revenge.  And he brings loud people to every show that he's at. 
[01:03:30]  He does?  It's fucking mind-boggling.  Oh, did he go to a show and it was loud as table?  The lady he was with was just yapping.  Yeah, she was his mom's friend.  Oh, great.  She likes comedy, I guess.  And that was his date?  Couldn't stop talking during the show.  His mom's friend?  What kind of twisted fucking life?  Oh, he just brings loud people everywhere.  Oh, Bobo.  All right.  We can break, and maybe we can get back to Highlight Girls Daily. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, that was great.  Do a little reset, maybe.  Oh, fuck yeah.  We were looking at tits.  What happened?  I don't know.  We started the show beautifully.  It was a perfect start.  It was a perfect fucking takeoff.  Smooth rollout on the runway.  The nose came up.  And then just fucking disaster.  Right into a mountainside.  We thought it was just clouds.  Oh, it was a mountain.  Jordan.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[01:04:30]  If we have a karaoke machine at FH Raleigh's, you're not allowed to sing.  Oh, come on.  Because we don't let professionals sing.  Bulls flying.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Shut up, you stink.  No, you didn't.  You fucking suck.  No, you didn't.  He was good.  You have an affected, stupid voice.  I watched the videos on your fucking YouTube channel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do a lot better.  Fuck you.  Fuck your mother, you cunt hole, dick bag shit fuck. 
[01:05:00]  You suck.  You have an affected, over tremoloed voice.  You stink.  You don't stay on key.  You have no power to your voice.  You're a shitty singer.  Shitty.  You talk about how you go to fucking karaoke nights.  They laugh at you.  You dick bag.  Fuck you.  You're not funny.  You suck singing.  You're a loser.  Loser.  You're arguing with the block of cement.  You know that, right? 
[01:05:30]  No.  Jordan, you know you're good.  Tell him, Jordan.  Thank you very much, Jimmy.  You're welcome, bud.  I fucking blow you away.  You ruined the Neil Diamond song.  Ruined it.  I did a lot better job than you.  Fuck you, cunt.  You stunk.  You stunk.  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never seem so good. 
[01:06:00]  Lampin' and grind.  You believe they never would.  God, no.  Shut up!  You over-affected shithead.  You stink.  You finally had it with Jordan, huh?  He stinks.  I disagree.  I thought he did a good job.  Oh, you'd be first place on America's Got Shit.  Oh, Jordan.  The yuck factor.  You suck.  Shut up. 
[01:06:30]  I'm so, I'm so.  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never seem so good.  I've been a great.  You suck.  You suck.  You suck.  You suck.  Shut up.  You've had it with Jordan.  I hate this guy.  What happened to this show?  I fucking hate this guy. 
[01:07:00]  What happened to this show?  Lampin' and end.  Do the Michael Buble.  Michael Buble.  You're awful.  I hear a little jealousy.  Jordan.  Jordan, to you.  I think he's very jealous of me, and it's really sad.  Let's do a little contest on Saturday.  Yep.  There you go.  That's it.  Why are all these challenges?  Maybe people just want to hang out, you fucking freak.  It's game night.  Can't we just hang out? 
[01:07:30]  Everything's a challenge.  Right.  I'm not the only one that wants to karaoke.  It's not just me.  No, you're not allowed.  How about you?  Don't karaoke.  Because we decide you're a professional.  Because you suck.  That's right.  I ain't no fucking professional.  You suck.  And how much money are you going to spend at FH Rileys this weekend, Jordan?  Skin Flint.  Probably about 40, 50 bucks.  There you go.  Wow.  Look out.  If that's true, we'll take that.  Look out.  We'll take that.  We're not fans of the guys who just stand around and drink a water for three straight  hours.  Is that with a girl?  You're not doing me any favors.  And send something. 
[01:08:00]  And stare at the talent.  Right.  Fucking have a beer, will you?  Jesus.  Sweet Caroline.  It's a good version.  There he is.  This is Jordan, obviously.  From live day.  Oh, listen.  It's pretty good, Ann.  Pretty good. 
[01:08:30]  He's all off.  I love it a place.  Where's your sweet Caroline, Ann?  I don't see yours.  I fucking rule.  I rule.  I'm a maturian candidate.  Look at the night.  Look at the night.  It don't seem so lonely.  I bet you're lonely.  There you go. 
[01:09:00]  You piece of shit.  There you go.  I'm going to put it up with only two.  Two.  I'm wearing your belt, Goodyear.  All right.  Enough of this, Jordan.  I'm like, I'm tired.  And when I hurt and runs off my shoulder.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  One freaking song.  Jordan, you got another song that you can do right now?  Yeah, go ahead.  A little jealousy to me.  Right now?  Am I right or wrong, Jordan?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy, this guy is so freaking jealous.  He's so afraid that I'm going to beat him and carry over you all the time. 
[01:09:30]  Yep.  Oh, that's a pretty good line right there, Ann.  Is there a contest on it?  What are you, oh, you're calling me out?  You're just so jealous, you retarded ferret.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my retarded ferret.  I do like Jordan's one line.  Look out.  I've got to be honest with you.  It's like them.  Look out.  It's like duets.  You know what I want for Christmas?  I want Kim Kardashian to switch to white meat.  Oh, shit.  You know, just when I want to hate him, he comes across as something fucking funny.  You got to respect that.  He wasn't funny.  You got to look like that. 
[01:10:00]  We aren't on a show, Ann, and that was a good line.  You know that.  I'm giving you that one.  Look, even though I hate you, I can identify funny, and that's pretty good.  Yes.  I'll give you that.  I'll give you that one.  Funny knows funny.  You just turned so fucking fast.  That was like the best turn in radio.  Because it's fucking, it's funny, it's funny.  Yeah.  That's, what am I going to do?  Fair is fair, Jordan.  Funny is funny.  You're on a roll.  You got any other ones?  I don't want to pressure you, but.  The one for Christmas is a Coke-stained Lindsay Lohan vagina.  Oh, shit.  He fucking, you want to hate him, but then he comes across with fucking lines. 
[01:10:30]  Maybe he won't blow on her vagina.  God damn it.  I hate that.  Mm-hmm.  That's where you shine.  Look, your karaoke, all right, you'll leave a lot to be considered there, but.  I think I still do jealousy talking.  I don't want to give you everything on that Thanksgiving, so I just want to give a little  taste, because there's more coming, buddy.  But you're funny is what it is.  You're like, your comedy is really good.  You're singing, little to be desired, but your comedy is pretty good.  I like it. 
[01:11:00]  It's funny.  Simon Cowell.  What's that?  Ah, shit.  See?  Simon said something.  Ah, Chip.  Chip's funny, too, right?  That was like Chip.  Exactly.  Get it?  That was effortless.  That one was effortless, man.  Oh, boy.  I didn't hear you.  All right.  You know, I almost made it to the X Factor.  You did?  Yeah, I went into New Jersey, and I made it down to 26,000 people.  Well, I made it out of 26,000 people down to 300.  Damn. 
[01:11:30]  That's pretty close.  Oh, you did?  That's pretty close.  For doing what?  Singing?  Yeah, for singing.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty fucking close.  300, huh?  300.  How did you know that you made it down to 300, compulsive fucking liar?  Compulsive liar?  Yeah.  How did you know?  I had a little jealousy there.  How did you know?  He's following his dream.  Go ahead, Jordan.  They don't tell people, like, wow, you made it to 300.  They don't tell you that.  They told you, right?  I figured it out.  Right. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, you figured it out.  Would you count?  Right down to the...  Do a head count?  No, they...  Do you know your singing is fucking awful?  It's just trouble.  Do you even understand, Jordan, that your singing is fucking awful?  You're not good.  My singing is not horrible.  No, no, you're not even near good.  You're so fucking bad at singing that it's a joke.  People laugh at your singing.  Yeah, right.  Do you get it?  I'm ignoring you right now. 
[01:12:30]  I'm just thinking about...  I'm traumatized by that fucking Bobo dick pic.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, change the subject to fucking...  Oh, I thought there was a line coming.  All right, we'll wait for it, though.  Yeah.  You're not good.  Well, all I want for Hanukkah is for Joan Rivers' base supports to turn into manure.  See?  Hanukkah is coming.  It's got chops.  And it's topical.  Oh, yeah.  How are you going to spend Hanukkah?  Spend Hanukkah?  Well, I have no idea yet. 
[01:13:00]  I'm just thinking about tomorrow.  That's all.  I'm just thinking about today.  I live for it today.  I don't think about fucking Bobo.  Atta boy.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  You're doing it tomorrow.  Live for it today.  Yeah, I don't want to go back into it being a fucking alcoholic.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Ant.  I've been sober a year.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, yeah?  Yep.  You should fucking celebrate with a drink.  Get it?  I'm going to be celebrating with a picture of your mom, Anthony.  Oh, wow.  Damn. 
[01:13:30]  Damn.  Too bad your mom wasn't sober when she was pregnant with you.  Yeah.  Wow.  That hurt.  That hurt.  So you're finally going for women then, I guess, huh?  Get it?  Homosexual.  Oh, there's nothing wrong with homosexuals.  Of course there isn't.  Please.  Except, you know, when your man mouth is wrapped around a cock, then there might be a little  something wrong with it, but...  Not if you're fucking Mr. Maloonigan's in Bobo.  Oh, shit.  Again, see?  Damn it.  Damn it.  That's too bad, man.  But he fucking nails it. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, Keisha, right for this show.  Wow.  Too bad we don't have a budget for that.  So, what do you think about the Jets on Sunday?  Oh, good.  This is great.  Yeah.  I'm going to eat my sandwich now.  That's a fair question.  Is it?  Yeah.  What happened?  He should be on the show.  He wants to do a sports break.  I think the Jets will win.  They're playing at home.  Kansas City.  Hey.  Do a sports break.  I think so, too.  As long as Sanchez doesn't throw the fucking ball into the stands. 
[01:14:30]  That's good.  That's good.  Sports and humor.  Can't go wrong with that.  He's got it all.  You work tits into that, man.  We're talking about a perfect human being right here.  He's got it all.  He's got it all.  If Mark Sanchez doesn't fucking shape up soon, he's going to be on America's next top Mexican  landscaper on the Home and Garden Channel.  Yeah!  I'll be honest.  Holy shit.  I'll be honest.  A little wordy, but you skated on that one.  That was good.  Yeah.  They're not all going to be perfect.  They're a little wordy, but you still got the laugh, though.  It's not a real show. 
[01:15:00]  That's good.  Oh, it's not a real show.  That's true.  Well, I just got to say that.  I couldn't stand Dane Cook the other day.  That guy is so fucking...  That guy is more washed up than Natalie Holloway.  Oh, I get it.  I like Dane, but a good one's a good one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good one.  What are you going to do?  Can I break this down, though?  He couldn't stand a guy that was on our show spilling his heart out to his friend that  died way too early.  Yeah.  You're right.  Good one.  I didn't like him on the show either that day.  Nailed him.  What the fuck? 
[01:15:30]  I think Jordan's speaking in general.  Am I right or wrong, Jordy?  What am I right or wrong?  I'm what?  No, I'm saying you were just speaking in general.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I just don't like Dane Cook at all.  I think he's just really overrated and...  Yeah.  It's terrible because he loves you.  Yeah, jump on the bandwagon with that bullshit.  Dane Cook loves me?  Yeah, right.  Jump on the bandwagon with that bullshit.  Yeah, he does.  You didn't read his tweets about you?  I don't follow him on Twitter. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, you heard your appearance on the show and fucking actually loved it.  So easy to jump on that bandwagon instead of thinking for yourself.  But just jump on that bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hey, I got it.  What's a bandwagon?  Is that a bandwagon like a wagon that's pulling music and acts around or something?  Ah, Chip.  I mean, you could say...  I want to play stuff.  You could say you don't like Dane Cook's humor.  That's fine.  But to say that he's not funny is completely ridiculous at this point.  Well, I don't know. 
[01:16:30]  I'm just giving my opinion.  You don't have to like it or hate it.  Oh, all right.  You're just kind of jumping on a bandwagon.  Point, Jordan.  You don't have a thought in your brain about it.  Can't all be as funny as Jordan.  Jordan's his own man.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  But I'll give you this much there, Jordan.  Everyone is retweeting your great one-liners.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  I got a big following.  One guy just wrote, switch to white meat.  Oh, shit.  Good stuff.  Hey, it is good stuff. 
[01:17:00]  So they are fucking retweeting those one-liners.  So I'll give you that much, man.  You're hilarious.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I'm hurting for work right now.  I know that that guy Joe is like fucking depressed because he doesn't have a job.  How do you not have a job?  Well, I'm stunned.  Why don't you sing, dude?  Aren't you in a band?  Yeah.  You should be in a band.  No band.  Nobody's giving me an offer yet.  What's your forte?  Well, stop at the creepy stare.  Maybe you'll get one.  What do you do for a living?  What was the last job you had?  Well, the last thing I did was working in the IT field. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, yeah?  I was a computer guy, but I just got tired of it.  You know, I just can't deal with that frustration.  Oh, man.  I've been doing something that I love, like being on your radio show, because you guys  fucking rock.  Yeah, but we don't have money for you.  Oh, you don't have money?  Well, maybe you should fire.  What do you think?  You just go from a job into radio or something?  Well, maybe you should fire intern Matt.  That guy's useless.  Oh!  Oh, shit.  He's right.  Wow.  Wow.  Now we're in a quandary.  Actually, the first thing I ever heard that was absolutely correct. 
[01:18:00]  But I'm a big intern Matt guy.  We're in a quandary, though.  But we don't pay Matt.  That's why the title, intern.  Yeah, of course.  Yes.  Matt's an idiot.  Well, I know you guys can find one for me somehow.  Just a blithering idiot.  All right.  Can we go, Jordan, and do our radio show?  Is that all right with you and Bobo?  Is that all right with you guys?  Well, you guys, well, I hope I get lit in on Saturday because I got plenty of friends  coming.  Cool.  Do they spend money?  Yes, they're going to spend money.  You don't have friends? 
[01:18:30]  Oh, I have friends.  You should see my fucking Facebook following.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you should see mine.  They're all friends.  They come to my house.  Yep.  Sweet Caroline.  You stink.  Shut up.  Sweet Caroline.  The good truck never been so good.  You're horrible.  Want to take this to break?  A little sweet Caroline for Jordan. 
[01:19:00]  Jordan, have a good weekend.  Yeah, rub Ant's face.  This guy's taking a song and making it better.  He's giving it his own twist.  Did you get that shirt, Bonnie Noah?  Chip time, then.  Shut up, Jordan.  You don't even know when to shut up when you hear your own voice.  The more that came from.  Really good Andy Williams.  This is horrible. 
[01:19:30]  You know, and if we get the karaoke machine at FH Riley's, I think it's only right that  Jordan gets to sing.  It just hit me.  I think it's only right that Jordan gets to sing.  I got something big to the adulation of the crowd.  Yes.  You know what?  Why?  Why make them suffer?  Exactly.  Jordan absolutely should sing.  Come on.  What are you talking about?  Oh, yeah.  Hopefully a Christmas number. 
[01:20:00]  Shut the fuck up.  Listen to this idiot.  What happens to them, Jimmy?  I don't know.  They're retarded.  Because they're so selfish.  Yeah.  They just want to hear themselves.  What were you saying, Jordan?  Do you got more?  Go ahead.  Go.  I'm not selfish.  I just like singing and entertaining people.  You like giving back.  Making people happy with your voice.  Singing and entertaining people.  That's...  Hopi, are you entertained?  It might go together.  What?  Were you entertained by my voice?  I sure was, Jordan.  Me too. 
[01:20:30]  Me and Jimmy certainly were.  I think Ant was too, but he just understands there's competition around the corner.  Ant's in the music biz, so I understand where he's coming from, but I don't know  any better.  I think that's an amazing voice.  Thank you very much, Ant.  And Jimmy thinks the same.  Oh, I love Jimmy, man.  He's one of the best comics out right now.  Thank you.  Why not the best?  My condolences on the loss of Patrice.  I know what it's like to lose a close friend.  I've lost too many in the past.  Thank you.  Yeah, exactly.  They just walk away from you, though.  They don't die.  They just leave after two words out of your fucking crawl. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, sure.  They change their phone numbers and email accounts.  Yeah, were they moving a $10 or something?  Why don't we get Bobo back in the line?  I need somebody to fucking destroy because they're already taking you out.  Anthony.  Oh, well, you know.  Why'd you have to make it obvious again?  We all knew.  You couldn't just let it go.  Why don't you just drink two V4s?  I got a V8.  My people on Twitter are definitely just killing it right now.  They love me. 
[01:21:30]  I'm getting old.  I love it that people hate me.  What's your Twitter name?  Let's give it a plug-a-roo.  Okay.  Can I get a couple plugs in?  Yeah, a whole show.  We'll plug it.  Sure.  I know you're smart enough to know when these people attack you on Twitter, they don't  mean it.  Yeah.  You know that.  I know they don't mean it, but some people are hating because they're jealous because  they can't sing like me.  There you go.  See?  Fucking Jordan knows this shit.  Well, first, I want to give a plug-up.  Why is Bobo's Twitter name like 80 out of the 140 characters? 
[01:22:00]  What's wrong with this kid?  He's a fucking retard.  Why is his name that long?  Why does he run around the yard and take three seconds?  He's an absolute dummy.  Doesn't the guy live in a fucking apartment building?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  Go.  Go.  He lives in an apartment.  Go.  Don't forget.  Riff on that.  Riff on that.  Don't be jealous. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Fucking don't.  Don't be jealous.  I'm seeing sweat, Caroline.  She's hot as something.  Oh, stop.  What's your Twitter account?  Because we got shit to do.  Okay.  No.  My Twitter account is TheJordanK.  And you can also check out DynamicLimo.com if you need a limo or transportation to FH Riley's.  You got to spell out K.  K-A-Y.  K-A-Y.  TheJordanK.  K-A-Y.  TheJordanK.  TheJordanK.  And you run a limo company or something?  No.  My buddy runs a limo company.  All right.  You know that. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  You owe us $250.  You do know that, right?  Yeah.  No, I'm serious.  You can't do that.  It's very illegal.  It's illegal?  Yes.  Am I going to get raped in the ass by somebody named Jerry Sandusky or something?  I'm starting a Twitter account.  It's going to be Chippity Doodah Chippity Day at Twitter.  Oh, you're cracking them up.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  No, but I can do that.  But everyone will retweet me.  You're not going to start that because now someone's going to grab that.  Chippity Doodah Chippity Day at.  I logged into Facebook to find Jordan's Facebook, and Bobo is messaging me.  Oh, good.  What's he saying?  Sorry, I woke up and called in at the wrong time when I called in.  I just woke up, did turn on my radio, yet hope the boys understand.  And yes, Anthony can still visit my house on Christmas Day.  He thinks I'm going to go over on Christmas.  Why wouldn't you? 
[01:24:00]  But Bobo, I get these guys confused.  He was on hold during the whole suicide thing.  So he was listening to the suicide guy.  He had to be.  When you're on hold, you hear the show.  How at the end of that big apology, he turns it around and makes it about himself.  He says that you can still go to his house on Christmas.  Again, he makes it about himself.  Because he's, like all mentally ill people.  Yes.  These self-obsessed zilches who think that there's nothing. 
[01:24:30]  They think the world should, they think there's four mirrors should be around them.  At all times.  Go out, fucking assholes.  I don't have any mirrors around me.  I'm trying to lose some weight, man.  I'm not that fucking good looking.  Come on.  So go look.  So go look.  And I broke a mug.  I couldn't.  I messed up.  God, why look better than the average guy?  Yeah, you sure do, Jordan.  All right, buddy.  You're perfect.  Good looking guy.  There's nothing wrong with you, obviously.  You've got everything going.  I know I have flaws.  Everybody has flaws.  I'm not fucking conceited. 
[01:25:00]  I'm a very good guy.  You just haven't gotten to know.  No, you're not.  No, he is.  What's the problem?  Two out of the three of us like you.  And the other guy likes him.  Ant likes him, too.  Ant is a little jealous.  The guy, he sees the competition creeping up behind him.  That's it.  You're a little nervous, huh, Ant?  You know what?  When he takes my song, my song, my benchmark, my trademark song, and butchers it, I thought  he did a good job.  You know that song was written by a child molester? 
[01:25:30]  Huh?  Yeah.  You didn't get that.  Oh, God.  There's a lot of controversy on that song because...  Oh, give us a little background on it, why don't you?  What he's going to say is like the...  What's his name there?  Neil Diamond was singing about Carolyn Kennedy.  Right.  It's kind of a little creepy.  Carolyn Kennedy?  Is it Carolyn or Caroline?  Caroline.  How about we just make it one?  Why do we have to have two versions of that stupid name?  Then we're all confused every time we see the person.  How about give us one bar of the chorus? 
[01:26:00]  Come on, Anthony.  No, no, I'm asking you, Jordan.  How about just one bar of the chorus?  Dumb fuck.  I've been singing it the whole morning like an idiot.  Yeah, I'm not singing Sweet Caroline anymore.  That's Anthony's song.  No, just the chorus.  You've got to make it yours.  That's the point.  Yeah, I can have it.  Sweet Caroline, good times never felt so good.  Like a bird flu.  Damn it, that's good, man.  Early in the morning, too? 
[01:26:30]  The fucking pipes aren't warmed up yet?  We're already spun.  Holy fuck, is that good?  Terrible.  It's so affected.  Oh, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.  Is that a threat or a promise?  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Where would that come from?  I don't threaten people.  I'm a nice guy.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, yeah, don't get my fucking reference with what I said.  Whatever.  Just keep talking.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  Go ahead, Jordan.  What were you saying, buddy?  Hey, Andy, why don't you fucking suck on my froggy legs, okay?  He does impressions, too, dude. 
[01:27:00]  You're in trouble.  I know.  He's fucking singing.  He's got the one-liners, and now he's doing impressions.  You're fucked.  I know.  He's got the full package.  You're fucked.  The full Monty.  He's Anthony circa 1995.  You're fucked.  That's it.  Damn it, you're fucked.  That means you could just step into a fucking radio gig.  Mm-hmm.  At any given time, I guess.  Yeah, that's Anthony circa 1995 is just step into a radio job.  You got the pipes.  You got the imitations. 
[01:27:30]  You got the fucking laughs.  You're ready to rock.  You're rolling.  Yeah, motherfucker.  I am on a fucking roll.  See?  He's got the voices.  I don't know what that voice was.  What is that voice?  Anyone?  You don't know?  No.  Jordan, tell them who you just fucking did.  I know.  Jimmy knows.  You don't know Cleveland from the Cleveland show?  Oh!  That was fucking spot on, brother.  God damn.  See, I thought it was fucking nasty.  Someone thought it was.  Kurt Lough thought it was Fizz. 
[01:28:00]  Let the record stay.  Hey, I ain't fucking around anymore.  That was Kurt Lough.  That was Kurt Lough.  Go watch it.  I gotta give out the shout out to Kurt Lough.  He's one of my biggest fans.  So is Rex Ransom.  No, he's not.  He is.  Kurt Lough hates you.  No, he doesn't.  Like everyone else hates you.  No, he doesn't.  They make fun of you.  Nope.  Because you're a dick bag.  That doesn't make any sense.  You think Kurt Lough just pretends to like him because of the goof?  It doesn't make sense.  It's the goof factor.  Jordan, don't let these guys fucking knock you down, brother.  Nobody's ever going to knock me down. 
[01:28:30]  Right on.  Sam, have you removed your dick from John Cena's mouth yet?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  Honestly, I don't even know how to come back.  Holy shit.  I can't even look at Sam.  Sometimes you gotta know.  Oh, I gotta turn his mic off.  Sam, you're done.  I'm down.  Holy shit.  I can't even look at him.  You're down.  You're down.  Jordan, I think that you're out right there.  You're not going to beat that one.  That was amazing.  Well, I think I'm going to end on a good note because I know you guys want to hang up on me. 
[01:29:00]  I think it's a little late.  No, we would have hung up on you if we wanted to hang up on you.  You know that.  So, we're going to let you go nice today.  Jordan gets to leave the show nice.  So, why don't you say goodbye and just hang up your phone there.  Do it all nice for everybody.  You guys can just lead me out, I guess.  All right.  Lead me out the past.  All right, Jordan.  Maybe I'll go jump off the bridge like Joe.  All right.  All right, Jordan.  Bye.  Bye, boys.  Oh, look at more imitations. 
[01:29:30]  There you go.  He leaves the show nice.  Oh, God.  He kind of looks like Bobo, too, doesn't he?  Yeah.  He looks like a steroid version of fucking Bobo.  He does have a Bobo look to him.  If Bobo is on steroids, he would kind of look like Jordan, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's like twins.  Ugh.  God damn.  He's an idiot.  That could be the weirdest hour and a half.  It started off with the nice boobies and naked blonde. 
[01:30:00]  I don't know what happened after that.  Looking like a young Pam Anderson.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Big fat knees.  Oh, no.  That girl was fucking great.  She was.  What a great picture, man.  If she didn't have ringworm on her knee.  Ringworm?  She did.  She had big ringworm on her dumb knees.  He's very picky with knees.  I don't care if she had water balloons on her knees.  He wants to run everyone's party, man.  No, I don't need a perfect girl.  I just prefer that they don't have a parasite or a virus on their knees. 
[01:30:30]  She had a ringworm on her knee.  I don't think there was ringworm there.  There was a big red ring.  Oh, no.  She fell into a burning ring of worms.  I'll give her a vagina worm.  Yeah.  With my worm.  That's tasteless.  Oh, I know.  Hey, Joe Rogan's trying to find a place to eat steak.  Steak in Toronto.  I always heard that Canada is not the place to eat steak, right?  I don't know.  They all got that mad cow disease up there.  He's like, where's the best place to get a fat steak in Toronto tonight?  Joe Rogan on Twitter.  Is he talking about a girl? 
[01:31:00]  No, man.  He's a good guy.  He's doing the right thing.  But he wants a fucking steak.  I always remember from my Buffalo days, you just didn't eat steak in Canada.  In Toronto, the one place.  Maybe they fly it in at this point, because I'm talking years ago.  Ted's Canadian Steak Emporium is supposed to be a very good place.  I bet.  Try a Canuck Burger, Gregory.  It's delicious.  We have steak, eh? 
[01:31:30]  That's the question we might have to answer next.  Can you get a good steak in Canada?  I would assume.  Toronto and Montreal.  I would assume they fly that shit in now, right?  Canada's supposed to be, like, good, isn't it?  I remember they always used to tell us, don't get red meat in Canada.  The keg mansion, downtown Toronto.  That's what I'm hearing here.  No.  But we need guys that have had, or ladies, that have had steak in Toronto and, let's say,  you know, a nice place in America. 
[01:32:00]  Is it comparable?  I really want to know this.  I would think Canada's probably got good steak.  Yeah.  I don't think they used to.  I would think.  In regular places.  Why?  Places I was able to afford back in the day.  You didn't get red meat.  No?  Why is that?  I don't know, man.  Because I think they, don't they, I would assume that's what they eat.  But if they have, like, country pride, maybe they're not taking meat from other places.  I don't know.  Do they have cows up there?  I think they do. 
[01:32:30]  Caribou and buffalo.  I've had buffalo.  You know what happens when you're eating buffalo steak?  You're wishing it was a regular steak every time.  It's like, ah, this would be good if it was beef.  Right.  This buffalo would taste great if only it was beef.  Oh, you got to eat venison.  I got a cookbook on how to eat venison.  And, oh, it's delicious.  You just go out there in the country.  You shoot your own thing.  And that little kid wants to shoot a bear.  Like, shut up.  I love the whiskey.  You're not into the venison? 
[01:33:00]  Oh, fuck you, deer.  That bitter garbage.  I know.  You got to soak it in buttermilk to get the gamey flavor out of it.  And then you, really?  How about you just stop making excuses for shooting deer?  You don't like venison.  You don't want to feel like a total cunt for shooting an animal that has nothing but antlers and a little fluffy tail?  I'd just punch him.  Just box him.  I knew a guy who made his own homemade beef jerky out of venison.  Ah, venison jerky.  What a fun guy.  He must have been around the holidays. 
[01:33:30]  He was jerky.  And he would also, because he really enjoyed his venison, we would go to the Bills games, or the Bills game, I guess, and do a little tailgating.  And he would have a big, huge pot of venison chili for everyone.  Ah, isn't that great?  It sounds putrid.  I'd rather eat a bag of shoes.  But he was excited because it was homemade with his venison.  That's fantastic.  That he killed himself.  Of course he did.  Moose steak in Canada?  Huh?  Really?  Moose steak. 
[01:34:00]  Moose.  In Canada.  Moose.  Is that true?  You ever have ostrich?  No.  My sister was working at a restaurant on Jericho Turnpike, and unfortunately I think some Jewish lightning took out the place.  That's what I'm saying.  Jewish lightning.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, well.  A very suspicious fire took out this joint.  Yeah.  I don't know for sure, obviously.  But they used to serve ostrich.  Well, they're customers too.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  You know what?  It was fucking amazing. 
[01:34:30]  Was it good?  Really?  It was amazing.  Now, you would think, because it's a bird, it would be more like poultry, but I hear it's more like beef.  This thing tasted exactly like steak.  Maybe it was a nice piece of steak, and they just said, you know, they want to fancy it up there.  I hear ostrich is like beef.  It was fucking amazing.  It really was.  Look, everyone, ostrich is good.  I'm not going to have ostrich.  I like steak.  I like when it's like, it tastes just like a good steak.  Get a good steak.  Oh, it tastes like chicken.  Have chicken.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Fucking eat exotic meats.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Want a break finally?  Yes.  Yeah, let's do that.  Oh, boy.  Someone hates me.  That's going to just ruin my day.  Oh, boy.  That's just going to fucking ruin my fucking day.  Oh, Jesus.  It's Christ.  Oh, well.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Ruth's Steakhouse in Toronto.  Ruth's or Ruth's Chris?  Ruth's Chris.  Oh, yeah.  I hate the name.  Huh?  It's hard to say.  I know.  Ruth's Chris.  No, it's Ruth's Chris. 
[01:35:30]  Ruth's Chris.  And then they go with the Chris without the Chris.  That doesn't make any sense.  It's Ruth's Chris.  Ruth's Chris.  You all right there, Grandpa?  I'm going to play a little club.  Stop your spilling it.  Ruth's Chris.  R-U-T-H-P-O-S-C-H-R-I-S.  It's a bizarre name.  What about Ruth's Steakhouse?  Yeah, how about Ruth's Chris or Chris's?  Ruth's Chris.  Ruth's Chris.  You have to purse your lips.  Ruth's Chris. 
[01:36:00]  You got to go with that S before you start the Chris in that name?  Just go to Peter Lugers.  I never went there.  I want to go to Peter Lugers.  We should do a Peter Lugers run.  I would love to.  And I hear they do credit cards now.  Oh, they do?  You got to go old school.  You got to go to Brooklyn.  When we went, me and Ann went once with some Wall Street guys.  Yeah, that's good.  And the homies are out there with their guns, and they'll watch your car for you.  It's fantastic.  You got to pay them.  You got to pay them nice.  See, don't they have a valet?  Maybe now.  This goes back where you had to pay the locals.  And basically, they were holding you up, because if you didn't pay the locals, then they 
[01:36:30]  were breaking into your car.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You know, the unruly youths would watch your car.  Doesn't Peter Lugers have people out there to do it?  I don't know.  It's been a while.  Probably.  Is it a bad neighborhood it's in?  Used to be.  It used to not be the best of neighborhoods.  Okay.  I would just take a car service.  I don't know anymore, so I don't want to fuck up their joint.  Do the locals fuck with Peter Lugers or no?  I don't think so.  No?  I wouldn't fuck with them.  I wouldn't.  That's probably.  That'd be kind of dumb.  I hear the food's amazing there. 
[01:37:00]  It's so goddamn good.  Really good.  Yeah.  People have said it's the best steak ever.  I don't know if it is, but I want to try it once.  It is.  It's really good.  And it's not even just the steak, like the appetizer meat they bring over.  It's just fucking meat.  I want to bring.  Bunch of meat.  Maybe I'll bring a broad there.  Honey, what do you want?  I want to have a steak hole there.  My treat.  Lugers, not the broad place.  No?  Why?  Not really.  You'll bring a buddy?  Some man's joint.  It's more like a bunch of guys that get together and have some steak.  I'll bring a young lady. 
[01:37:30]  Go ahead, my dear.  There's better places to bring a young lady, I do believe.  Unless that shit has changed, too.  I'd like to meet her.  Let me see.  Sam's opening Peter Lugers' website, which was done in apparently 1982.  But that.  Our story.  Oh, okay.  It's actually.  Well, there's one in Great Neck?  I don't want.  I want.  It's probably not as good as Brooklyn.  The original Brooklyn Peter Lugers.  Joey Paisano took me to the one in Great Neck, which is near your neck of the woods.  It was really fucking good.  Well, go there.  Fuck that. 
[01:38:00]  Seriously, it was really good.  I might go there tonight.  You should.  You should.  How far over the whatever?  I used to take some trains.  Into Brooklyn?  Not too far.  Going to Brooklyn?  Maybe.  Nice work, Lou.  Nice work, Luger.  Not too far.  That's pretty funny.  Why am I laughing?  That's so scary.  We should take a break.  It's almost two hours.  And I got to.  My God.  Look at the time.  Can we go home?  No.  We should.  No, we have.  We should.  Thanks.  Everyone have a great weekend.  Mike Bakur. 
[01:38:30]  What?  Mike Bakur.  Mike Bakur's checking in.  And we have a phone-in with Denaltrum.  Wow, really?  8.30.  Denaltrum.  A lot of people say bye, Ant, like I'm really leaving.  We're not leaving.  I have some questions.  We'll try to get to 9.30 today.  Trump is calling about his book, and I have some questions.  Look, he may or may not run, but I have some policy questions for him.  He's not going to.  Oh, really?  Donald Trump will not.  Some policy questions.  I do.  Now, I would assume he's quite the Republican.  Wait a minute.  Donald Trump's calling our show today?  8.30.  I thought he hated us.  I did, too.  Maybe he's over it.  His son might have said, look, they're okay. 
[01:39:00]  I was in this.  His son is.  He's an all right guy, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I like the Trump Jr.  I like Donald Trump Jr.  Junior Trump.  I think he's a junior, right?  Yeah, he's Donald Trump Jr.  Maybe that's who it was.  All right.  Let's go tinkle and make love.  All right.  Just tinkle?  I'm taking these off.  I'm just debating.  I'd be too early for all that activity.  Serious, Serious XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:39:30]  Just check the old Twitter and the Jordan Kay, K-A-Y, on Twitter. 
[01:40:00]  Well, that's Jordan, I guess.  He's got a lot of fans.  He just tweeted, at Jim Norton, and at Opie Radio.  Oh, good.  And what else?  Nope.  I don't see, at Anthony Coomey in this tweet.  I'm sorry, sir.  I'm sorry.  Just me and Jimmy on this one.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  He tweets, thanks for the love, boys.  You know real talent.  Oh.  He's not lying.  Maybe he's goofing on you two, saying, you know real talent. 
[01:40:30]  Oh.  Like, hey, both of you, you, because he spelled no, K-N-O-W.  Maybe he's just stupid.  If he wrote N-O, then I see what you're talking about.  You know real talent.  See, I'm jealous that we're getting compliments from Jordan.  And then it was followed, Amir, two tweets later by Radio Bobo XM 105 and Sirius 207.8.  How long is your stupid Twitter name, Bobo?  He writes, I'm getting ready, OB Radio, to kick the Jordan K ass in shouting match. 
[01:41:00]  He just is so needy.  He's a fucking.  I'm getting ready.  I'm getting ready.  To.  Him.  To kick Jordan K ass in shouting match.  I've had it with Jordan.  I've had it with Bobo.  And I've had it with fucking intern match.  I love intern match.  Oh, enough of him, too. 
[01:41:30]  What did he do yesterday?  He actually put Bobo, like, he tweeted Bobo and told him to call in.  Like, he's producing the fucking show now.  Really?  What a dumbass.  While Anthony Bourdain was on the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Intern Matt went ahead and told Bobo to call in because intern Matt thought it would be  funny if we talked about Bobo not getting into FH Riley's.  Thank God we, you know, pay attention to what intern Matt thinks is funny and great.  Could intern Matt grow his hair back, by the way? 
[01:42:00]  I've told him.  Everybody thinks it's a horrible haircut.  He looks so good.  He looks terrible.  He's a jerk off.  He is a jerk off big time.  What did you like him, jerk off?  No, I don't.  He looks like Ed Brimley.  Ed Brimley.  Grimley.  Whatever.  A couple of Johnny Neutrons.  Is it Grimley?  Ed Grimley?  Ed Grimley.  Ed Grimley.  Brimley.  Johnny Neutron.  I love that Mad Magazine guy with Alfred E. Newman.  Alfred E. Newman was one.  Before my hair.  Yeah.  Yeah, there were a ton of them.  He looks like an idiot. 
[01:42:30]  He acts like an idiot.  He is an idiot.  He didn't even get coffee right this morning.  This is the last.  Next week is his last week of his internship.  Oh, thank God.  Oh, that's not cool.  We've got to continue with him.  No.  Why?  Because he hasn't mastered coffee and his semester is over.  No.  I think he gets two semesters, right?  One.  Why?  There's two.  Everyone else got two.  The sex man is the intern boss.  And decides to only give him one?  Sal's coming back for a second semester.  Sal should be coming back for a second semester.  I like intern Matt. 
[01:43:00]  I go on the record.  This company should hire Sal if they were hiring people.  But that's a crazy concept.  I mean, we can get Eric on the phone if you want to veto his decision.  Why is Iraq not here today?  He's taking a little day for himself.  Oh, is he sick?  Did he even try to pull the sick thing this time or he just went, fuck it?  I don't know.  It's either a sick day or a vacation day.  I'll be honest.  He's definitely not sick.  I'm too scared to call him today.  Because the last time.  Oh, yeah, please.  Last time he really had a rough one.  What if he's consummating? 
[01:43:30]  Imagine that.  His wife will be happy.  I'll get the phone.  He's probably staring at it and hoping at race.  It could be consummating.  I don't think.  You think he's wearing a condom and he's going to wrap up that?  Oh, he's got to.  Yeah.  He's got to.  It's got to be the right time to introduce that amazing gold that is the Prince Nagel sperm.  Although he did.  Oh, seed, right?  Seed.  Seed.  I'm sorry.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  Seed.  I said, Eric, do you use Trojans? 
[01:44:00]  And he said, yeah, I used to, which means he's going bareback now.  Oh, shit.  For Eric.  Shit.  Could there be?  Blister boy.  A young heir to the Nagel throne.  Oh, my.  Can you imagine?  In the future.  Imagine that.  It's like a prince being born.  Prince Nagel.  Yes.  Prince Nagel.  My kid will not hang out with his kid.  No?  You want to have playdates?  Yeah.  I don't want to have bad eating habits.  Actually, you know what?  Nothing against the Hughes clan.  Yeah.  But are you really worthy to hang out with the Nagels? 
[01:44:30]  Well, the Nagel Seed.  Let's think about it.  The Prince Nagel Seed.  The Prince Nagel Seed, which he's kept pure and kept it away from such whores and hose  bags that he's been with in the past.  You think his kid would have those dreamy eyes like Eric has?  Oh, of course.  Definitely.  Keep in mind, Sexy has bedroom eyes, man.  Oh, Sexy.  Sexy.  This young child will be the heir to the Nagel fortune.  Wow.  All the Nagel collectibles. 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  Do you know how many Simpsons and wrestling toys?  And all that pocket money.  Oh, are you kidding?  The wrestling figures will be mine.  Someday, son, this will all be yours.  Eric will take him out for a Happy Meal and take the toy for himself.  Yeah.  He gets stuff signed.  He says it's for a charity auction.  Yeah.  Why have we done a big charity auction?  No, he stopped doing that.  Oh, he did.  Now he says it's for his nephew.  Well, he got me a signed Ratatouille DVD the other day. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, he did.  From Patton Oswalt.  But my kid doesn't read yet.  I was going to say, if there's anything an 18-month-old appreciates, it's autographed DVDs.  He only does that as an excuse to get it for himself.  I know.  I know.  I know his whatever.  18-month-old, they love autographs.  Yeah.  And let me tell you, the young Nagel heir will have the greatest of all autograph collections.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:46:00]  Of course.  No doubt.  Sexy will see to it.  By that time, no one will care about most of those names.  That's the problem with that shit.  You think he'll raise him in Florida so he ends up like Eric, you know, with that background  of being born and raised in Florida?  I think he should move back to Florida.  You don't want him in New York, yeah.  Eric really values his Florida roots.  He says, he told me in private.  That's a Florida.  That's how you say it.  Florida.  Florida.  Florida.  Florida.  Costume.  I wear a costume in Florida. 
[01:46:30]  Florida.  How do you say it?  You're a weirdo.  Florida.  You're a weirdo.  Not Florida.  Florida.  Florida.  Not Florida.  It's not Florida.  It's Florida.  Florida.  Florida.  Florida.  That would be F-L-O-O-R.  Floor.  Ida.  No, you say it differently.  Ma.  How do you say it?  Florida.  It's not floor.  Newer.  I hate manure.  It's a good name.  Really quickly.  I'm sure most of us saw this and we were dumbfounded by this. 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  American Psycho remake?  What are they doing?  Why?  You haven't heard this yet?  Please.  I've been fucking in shock watching the Three Stooges trailer.  I can't look at anything else at this point, but yes.  I saw everyone tweeting the Three Stooges trailer.  I haven't seen it yet because I thought it was just a dumb joke.  I thought it was a joke too.  Even after watching the trailer, I thought it was a joke.  Yes.  Why?  It's going to be politically correct.  Not even. 
[01:47:30]  You know what it is?  It's easy to watch those guys in black and white and you know it's them doing the slapstick  thing and it's funny because of when it was made and it's those guys in black and  white.  Why do they have to do this?  It doesn't work now.  Is Jim Carrey doing it?  I heard Sean Penn they had wanted as Larry Fine.  No.  They got...  But it's going to be politically correct.  They're going to fuck it up.  They got the guy from Mad TV.  Mad TV there.  What's his name?  But why can't they just come up with new ideas?  Yeah.  Will Sasso.  Will Sasso is Curly. 
[01:48:00]  So this is real?  When everyone was tweeting it.  Oh, yeah.  I thought it was some dumb funny or die thing or something.  It is so fucking awful.  My manager would ask me if I had wanted to audition for this a year ago or whatever.  I said no.  As what?  Under no circles.  Curly?  I don't like Curly.  You don't...  I know that.  You're not big enough.  You've got to be big and fat.  You would have been a good Curly.  I do very good Curly.  That is good though. 
[01:48:30]  That is good.  Hey, Moe.  People have noticed that E-Rock is now nesting.  Yeah.  God, I hate that.  Carolina man goes, hey, Ope, he did buy a house.  I think his wife is nesting, getting ready.  Oh.  Take on some Nagel seed.  I hope there's more Nagels.  All right.  Let's hit the three Stooges.  Bring Mikey in.  Oh, yeah.  Get him in here.  What the fuck are we doing?  There's an important guy right there.  We've got Donald Trump calling soon. 
[01:49:00]  Important guy.  Here he is.  And we've got Otto on the line.  There's just too much going on here.  What's up, Mike Baker?  Jesus Christ.  Look at him.  He's not even in a suit today.  Hey, you are like Indiana Jones today.  I got a bullwhip.  You got like, he's got that warm leather.  That's a sweet leather, man.  That is fucking nice.  I like that leather.  Where do you get that from?  No, what's the matter?  Not attractive enough today?  What's up with the leather?  Where do you get that?  I'm not working today.  You know, where did we get that?  My wife got this for me.  I like a nice leather jacket every once in a while.  That's a good one.  That's a brown leather.  That is like an Indiana Jones. 
[01:49:30]  You can't find good leather jackets.  It's tough to find.  One that doesn't look like a, you know, sort of a black leather, you know, Albanian jacket.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A plastic or something.  Yeah.  That's fucking worn in nights.  But you got to be a guy that can wear it.  He can wear it.  You can't fucking, yeah, of course.  But, you know.  He can wear it.  So other people wear this.  It doesn't look like they're adventuring.  You look like, you know, after I do this, I'm going to go discover a mummy.  Go adventure.  Yeah.  You look like you'd be dropped in for a covert operation somewhere.  We're going to go get that drone back.  That's what we're going to do.  Yes.  That goddamn drone.  Yeah.  What's up, man? 
[01:50:00]  Otto's on the line, too.  Otto's got a question for Anthony.  Otto.  What's up?  Hi, Otto.  Hi, fellas.  How you doing, pal?  Otto.  Good.  Quick question.  I'm going out to Arizona to do, like, this private, like, corporate gig.  Yeah.  They got, like, a whole weekend of activities.  So they invited us to a gun range.  Oh, nice.  A whole Death Wish fantasy going here.  I'm going to shoot guns with Ames Jancho from Death Wish, Stuart Margolin.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  And I want to know, like, some fun pistol to fire at the fucking, you know, targets there. 
[01:50:30]  Well, let me tell you something.  If you're just going to go out to shoot, you want something big.  You don't want to putz around with some little shit.  Go right for the big stuff.  You're looking at, first, a Desert Eagle.  You've got to try a .50 Cal Desert Eagle, right?  What do you think?  If they got it.  If they got it.  If they got it.  An Eagle.  If not, though, go with your .45s.  You need a good military 1911 .45 caliber pistol. 
[01:51:00]  What else would you think here?  You nailed that one in one.  Nothing beats the .45.  A nice big .45 is good.  Stick it in the mud and roll it out and it still works.  Yeah, yeah.  Fantastic gun there.  And then maybe something, if you want to try one of those Smith & Wesson 500s, those giant fucking revolvers.  If they don't have an Eagle, try one of those.  Oh, nice.  A .357 Magnum. 
[01:51:30]  Just like the fun, big, like, Dirty Harry guns.  Yeah.  Shit like that.  Stay away from .22s.  Like .22s with fixation.  Yeah.  Yeah, stay away from the small guns because you could do that anywhere.  Yeah, a little pussy Derringer.  Who needs it?  Yeah, fuck that shit.  Oh, shoot big, loud guns.  Yeah, well, Arizona's gun country, right?  Out there, they're good.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they'll probably line up Mexicans for you. 
[01:52:00]  As far as that Three Stooges, it's a bad idea.  Half-rocket will travel.  Even a feature film with the real guys sucked.  Yes.  They were good in shorts and they're irreplaceable.  They were freaks.  They were five feet tall.  So, it's not going to work.  Jim Carrey should really rethink this.  It's not him.  It's pretty much made.  It's going to be out in theaters soon.  This is the trailer for the film.  It's done.  It's going to be awful.  You're right, though.  The features never worked with them.  When they put them in color, it never worked. 
[01:52:30]  It was that black and white.  You knew it was old.  You knew it was slapstick.  And it was just them.  It doesn't work now.  No, you can't sustain that for 90 minutes.  It's just, you know, it's all resolved in 22 minutes.  It was a perfect length for the short.  Yeah.  And those guys are irreplaceable.  It never even ended.  Like, Curly would just go, wah!  And then it was, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  They didn't have an ending to those.  It's really insulting when they try to replace these guys that are...  It was with the sound of a skillet being hit with a bullet. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Bad idea.  Awful.  Yes.  He's making shit.  Bad idea.  The bio-picture was good with Michael Chiklitz.  That was good.  Because it told about their suffering and their struggle and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  The real, you know, like a biography.  But not trying to do it again is just stupid.  Well, I should have auditioned.  They wanted me to audition for it.  I do a really good Curly.  Oh, go ahead.  Yeah, I should have.  Let me hear it.  Hey, Moe. 
[01:53:30]  Trish told me you'd do a fantastic Larry fine.  Can I hear it?  Uh, it's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't have me, wah.  You're great.  Hey, I'm warning you.  Hey.  Hey, Moe.  Why don't we go fuck that young child in the shower?  Oh, and I'll jump in and do Curly.  Go ahead.  Hey, Curly, what are you up to?  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  What do you mean, nah, nah, nah, nah? 
[01:54:00]  Hi, Moe.  Hey, Moe, your haircut looks like a dickhead.  I'm gonna go see it just to sit there and cringe.  It's just Billy, it's just Billy West's impression of, of, uh, Larry is all I'm doing, really.  You're better than Billy West.  Oh, no, Billy West was the best.  Hey, get off those towers, I'm warning you.  Remember that Honeymooners movie they did?  It's gonna be as fucking embarrassing as that.  Yeah, horrible.  How do you remake, like, that type of genius?  We have a trailer.  Yeah, we gotta check out the trailer. 
[01:54:30]  For the movie.  Some of the stuff you just don't redo, obviously, but Hollywood just ignores that, always.  Yeah.  It's embarrassing.  I love you guys.  I'll clear the line now for you.  Thanks.  All right.  All right, Otto.  Have fun in Arizona.  Enjoy shooting guns.  Yes.  Thanks, buddy.  Take pictures.  The Pig Roast News Show every Wednesday.  All right, buddy.  Yes, pigroast.tv.  Thanks, Otto.  Take video.  See you, buddy.  I can't wait to see Otto shooting guns.  That's kind of like hysterical.  That's psychopath.  This is where the trailer starts?  No. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  We'll start at Samson's down here.  Mike and I in the studio.  Mike Baker in the studio.  It's going to be funny.  A stranger rode.  See, there's three babies, and they're just thrown onto the stoop of a church.  A miracle.  There's the babies.  Is that Larry David?  Oh, thanks.  This spring.  What did that get?  Go back.  This is an iPhone.  Go back?  Was that Larry David?  That might have been as a nun.  It was a man as the nun.  Was it?  Oh, boy. 
[01:55:30]  No.  I don't know.  No, it looks like Larry David.  It looks too young.  It's too young, yeah.  It was more wrinkly.  And the fingers came up and poked the nun in the face.  Sounds like Larry David.  Is it Larry David?  No, he wouldn't do that shit.  No, he wouldn't.  Maybe he would.  Well, that's why he got scared.  I don't think he would do this shit.  Okay.  This spring.  What did that get?  This is an iPhone.  Someone says Larry David is the nun.  Hello?  Hello?  He's holding it to his eye.  Get some mulch.  Plus respect. 
[01:56:00]  Mind your P's and Q's.  Don't forget to drop the eyes.  I've seen it, though.  No, I don't.  They're just doing all the slapstick.  It's coming on.  And curly.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  All right.  I'm gonna have a slap.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Oh, hiya, Sister Bernice.  There's something different about you.  Did you get a haircut?  Oh, boy.  You got any dynamite? 
[01:56:30]  I don't know.  I'm not feeling too good about this.  Come here.  No, no, no.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ball's got this.  Hiya, Snook.  Squeeze by it.  I got your present.  Really?  Yeah, come on.  Open it.  Snookies in it. 
[01:57:00]  It's gotta be good.  She's Snookies in it.  I'll say this, though.  They really, they're actually good impressions.  Yeah, they're good impressions.  They actually look like the guys more than I thought they would.  Why do they have to put Snooki in it?  Because she's topical.  Makes me want to stab a fork in my eye.  It really does.  That's just so sad.  Why would you put Snooki in it?  It's topical.  It's so fucking stupid.  Oh, you've got to get the kids to go in because they don't know what the Three Stoogies are.  So they're going for the Jersey Shore Markets, so let's get Snooki in there?  Oh, yeah, let's get Snooki in there.  See, I would want to see a Three Stoogies movie that was about their lives. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, yeah, there is one, actually.  You want to see that if they were playing in their real lives?  They did that.  That's what Otto was talking about.  They made a movie where it's like a biography of the Three Stoogies.  Yeah, yeah, it shows their fucking suffering and all that shit.  He wanted girls and he couldn't get them because he was fat, so he lost weight.  I would imagine what the pitch meeting looked like for this.  Yeah, this is what we're going to do.  We're going to remake.  It's going to be great.  We're going to remake the Three Stoogies. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, we're going to hit them with it.  It's going to be just like it.  Hammers on the head and you know that thing they do where they poke them in the eyes?  We're going to do that for 90 fucking minutes.  You're right.  Let's do it.  This is great.  Larry David would indeed do this shit.  He's credited on IMDb as shit.  Good call.  You saw that.  Wow.  Is Larry David producing this or something?  Does he have a vested interest in this?  Credited to Sister Mary Mengele.  I think that was him without the glasses.  You're right.  I think it's Sister Mary Mengele.  Mengele.  You know, like Joe Mengele.  You don't know that. 
[01:58:30]  Jim Carrey?  No, he was supposed to play Curly.  But he was rumored to and then Sean Penn.  But the guys they have look good.  Oh, wow.  They have the entire Jersey Shore cast.  They have the Old Spice guy.  What?  What?  They have the Jane Lynch from Glee.  I was supposed to do it.  No, you weren't, Chip.  There's no way.  Jimmy could have been in this fucking movie.  No, I couldn't have.  I would have been terrible.  Well, that guy's really good.  You'd fit right in.  Yeah, certainly.  It's horrible, horrible. 
[01:59:00]  Certainly.  I do good impressions.  You don't give this movie a shot?  No.  No.  Not at all.  Larry David is not a producer.  It looked better than I thought it would.  He must know somebody that's doing this.  What's the opening weekend?  What do you think the opening weekend's going to be?  80 mil?  No.  80 mil.  I'll take 100 bucks and says it's not over 15.  I don't know.  Yeah, 15.  10 to 15.  It's a Farrelly Brothers movie?  Yeah.  They do all right with their movies.  Well, not with this one. 
[01:59:30]  They were brave enough to take this one on.  I bet this is a bomb.  Or is it Farley?  Farley, Farley.  Farley.  Farley.  Is it?  Yeah, Farley is Chris Farley.  But you say Florida.  Farley Brothers.  Yeah, we can't take your word for it.  Not the Farley Brothers.  Farley Brothers.  Some shit's just got to be done and left on the shelf, right?  Yes.  Just leave it alone.  Leave it.  Don't, don't, don't.  Let it sit and age like a fine line.  You know what's funny?  Physical comedy's great, right?  It's very funny.  Case in point, just the other morning, I got three boys. 
[02:00:00]  But the four-year-old and the two-year-old woke up early.  They're downstairs.  And the two-year-old starts screaming, starts yelling.  So my wife runs downstairs.  He's standing in the middle of the living room.  The four-year-old's over in the corner laughing.  The four-year-old decided what he was going to do was take the goldfish, the family goldfish,  Mr. Bubbles, out of the goldfish bowl and stuff it down the two-year-old's pants.  Oh, shit.  That's comedy.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  That's not going to be in this movie.  Right.  They're not going to shove goldfish down children's pants.  Yeah, exactly.  In this movie.  But they did the lobsters. 
[02:00:30]  That's true.  They did the lobsters.  That's true.  That's about as close as you're going to get.  I want to talk to Mike about this, though.  Mike Baker, of course.  Mike was with what we call the agency.  Called the agency.  That's all we call it.  Yeah, it's just the agency.  The CAA.  The company.  The CAA?  Yes.  He's an agent.  If you want to be pedantic, yes.  Yes.  And I like delving into world issues.  And especially, you know, we did have a drone that went down in Iran, which isn't good, I think. 
[02:01:00]  And this is one of those real high-tech ones.  Yeah.  One of the stealth drones, which looks like one of those F-117s almost.  It kind of looks like a mini version of that, not one of those long kind of football-y looking drone things.  What kind of consequences are we looking at?  Well, A, it's not good.  You're right.  Yeah.  I mean, it's pretty fucked up, I think, because most...  That's the official report. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, that is.  I talked to the director, and I said, how's it looking?  He said, it's pretty fucked up.  It's pretty fucked up.  For your eyes only, open it up.  It's pretty fucked up.  Sir.  Sir.  Shit is crazy out there.  It ain't good.  But I think any middle school kid who's in class and drawing a super evil weapon on his  three-ring binder is going to include a self-destruct mechanism in that, right?  Right, you would think. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  So a lot of people right now are kind of smacking their head against the wall thinking, well,  okay, now we lost connection with it.  It certainly looks that way, right?  Yeah.  There was a lot of talk initially saying, look, this thing's flying up at 45,000, 50,000 feet.  By the time it hits the sand, it's going to be in thousands and thousands of little pieces.  Right.  So they're not going to be able to really do much with it.  And then they show it's fully intact.  So part of it is it looks like it lost the connection, lost the tether to the control systems.  Yeah.  And it's up there, it's aerodynamic, that's the whole point of it, right? 
[02:02:30]  Maintain lift and stay up there for a long period of time.  So it appears as if, in fact, it may have glided to the ground.  And just pretty much, in essence, landed.  In somebody's backyard in Iran.  And so there's a lot of concern here.  Part of it is the design of it isn't necessarily unknown, right?  I mean, there's a lot about sort of the way that it's shaped, the way it's looked.  That people have already figured out.  Yeah, that's been on shows before. 
[02:03:00]  You watch, like, the Science Channel and stuff.  And you could see, yeah, the stealth, you know, where they have this reflective surface that is, you know, it kind of, it's very angular and very stealthy.  And it's what it's carrying, though, is the problem.  Right.  Maybe the Iranians will give it back.  Yeah, I think so.  Have you seen the pictures of, have you seen some of the video of these guys looking around at it?  Have you seen some of that?  They're standing, the coots force, and some of the military standing around.  It's like that, what was that, 2001 Space Odyssey?  Yeah, with the monkeys. 
[02:03:30]  Can we hold four seconds?  Donald Trump is on the phone.  We have to wait for a few minutes.  Oh, yes.  And then we'll get back to the stealth.  Yes.  Mr. Trump.  Good morning.  You're talking about stealth.  That's very interesting.  Yes, we were talking about the stealth, the drone that went down in Iran.  And you think they're going to give it back?  Or were you being sorry?  I think Jim Norton was being facetious.  Yeah, I was curious.  Yeah, because I don't think they'll give back anything.  Maybe if we get Ronald Reagan in office, that's what happens.  Ronald Reagan, they'd give it back. 
[02:04:00]  That's when they start giving stuff back, when we put Reagan in office.  But, yeah, Mr. Donald Trump.  It's been a while.  You're not a big fan of Obama, because you happen to call it this moment.  Middle East policy, do you think that he's handled that well, or do you think that he has not done a good job there with the Middle East?  Well, it's a disaster.  I mean, if you look at Libya, I mean, look at what's going on with Iraq.  And I will tell you this.  As sure as you folks are sitting there, within a very short period after we leave Iraq, as soon as we leave, Iran is going to take over those incredible oil fields. 
[02:04:30]  You know, they have the second largest oil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia.  Yeah.  Iran will go in.  You know, we've totally wiped out their army.  They have no army.  And they're going to go in, and they're going to take over Iraq, as sure as you're sitting there.  And they're going to take over those incredible – what do we get?  We spent $1.5 trillion, thousands of young, wonderful people killed, wounded all over the place, 40,000 people wounded, badly, severely wounded.  Yeah.  And we get nothing.  Now, what would you think would be the solution if not to pull all our troops out? 
[02:05:00]  Now, believe me, I don't agree with Obama either.  But what would your solution be that would keep that from happening?  Well, I would have done much different, and I still would, to be honest with you.  I'd take the oil.  I would just take the oil.  You know, the oil would have a war.  And we'd – you have a war.  If you win, you keep the – you know, to the oils.  And I would absolutely, very simply keep, at least, at a minimum, take our money back, the $1.5 trillion.  Pay the soldiers. 
[02:05:30]  I would – every soldier, every single soldier that died, their families get $5 million.  You know what that is?  It's nothing.  Nothing compared to the values that we're talking about.  It's like conscripts, though.  So I would do something like that.  When we leave Iran, we made it possible for Iran.  You know, Iran's been trying to take over Iraq for many years.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They had a little skirmish there a few years back.  Well, now we've denutered their army.  I mean, they have no army.  Right.  So Iran would just – you know, they were equally balanced.  One would move 100 yards. 
[02:06:00]  The other would move it.  Then they'd start throwing gas at each other.  Then they'd all sort of say, all right, let's – we'll see you in about 50 years.  Here's what I think, Mr. Trump.  Baghdad blackjack.  How about a Trump casino right there in Baghdad?  That's what I'm thinking.  Some table games.  Little craps.  They weren't big beneficiaries of our war.  And frankly, look, I'm a very hawkish person.  Yes.  But they didn't knock down the World Trade Center.  Okay, Iraq.  Iraq did not.  And whether you like Saddam Hussein or not, he killed terrorists.  He's showing them how to keep their people in line. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  Right now, Iraq is a breeding ground for terrorists.  It's a primary breeding ground.  I mean, I call it the Harvard of terrorism.  And if you want to go to Harvard, you go to Iraq if you want to be a terrorist.  And Saddam Hussein used to kill them immediately.  Yeah.  So what we've done is we've done ourselves no favors.  We've caused tremendous problems and dislocation and killed millions of people, if you think  about it, including the Iraqis.  Millions of people.  Millions of people.  You know, I'd see these bombings, like when they say they bombed for the first day, they  bombed Baghdad. 
[02:07:00]  So they're dropping bombs in the middle of Baghdad.  And then the next morning, they're like, oh, sorry, we killed three civilians.  Okay, three civilians.  I don't think so.  Mr. Trump, what do you say, though?  And I don't necessarily love Obama, but I think he's done a little bit more of a, he's  a little tougher on the Middle East than I thought he was going to be.  I mean, he got al-Walaki, I think he's in al-Walaki, bin Laden, Gaddafi is out.  I mean, he did things that Bush, who was seen as a more militaristic president, could  not get done or was unable to.  You know, tough is one thing. 
[02:07:30]  Stupid tough is another.  What do we get out of it?  And, you know, as far as bin Laden, look at this.  They come to him.  He's sitting in the office of the presidency.  They've come to him and they say, we have bin Laden under our sights.  What do you want to do?  Now, he could have said nothing, but nobody would have said that.  He could have said, drop a missile on him or go get him.  So he says, go get him.  And now he's a big hero.  What the hell did he do except he's sitting there?  Who wouldn't have said that?  All right, that was my point.  Yes, I agree, Mr. Trump.  Here's why I disagree, because it cost Jimmy Carter a second term when a risky mission into 
[02:08:00]  another country didn't work.  Like, they went into Pakistan, who's supposedly not a great ally.  But really, there was a lot at stake when he did do that, and it's his first term.  I thought it was kind of a...  I know, but you give the Navy SEALs the credit for that, and you give the military the credit.  I mean, he happened to be sitting in his seat, and they called him and they said, by the  way, we have him.  So what's he going to do?  He could have said, don't get him, leave him alone, which I don't think anybody would  have said that.  Or they could have taken him out with a missile, or they could have done what they did.  Either way would have been fine. 
[02:08:30]  Can I ask you a question, sir?  If he had, let's just say that the mission had failed, and those SEALs had been killed  in action, or not killed in action, let's just say it was a disaster and it just didn't  happen, would you still, would you give Obama the pass?  Would you say, hey, it's not his fault, the Navy SEALs screwed up?  Or would you blame him and go, that dummy, why did he go into a sovereign nation like that?  I would say that I would probably give him a little bit of a pass, but it would have  been, it would have certainly not been a good thing.  But then you would have said he should have gone in with a missile, which frankly, the 
[02:09:00]  way they got him, maybe the missile, it would have been just as good, or almost as good,  or maybe in some cases better.  Because after they got him, they gave him a ceremony.  I mean, this guy knocked down the World Trade Center, and they cleansed his body, and they  gave him a ceremony.  I think they wanted a little more of a confirmation than they would have gotten with a missile.  I mean, then, you know, you're pawing through things and perhaps having to deal with DNA,  and is it a son, is it him?  You know, that was like, all right, there he is, let's put some bullets in him. 
[02:09:30]  Right, right.  But I'm just saying this, if anybody is sitting in the office of the presidency, and they call  up, the military calls that we have him, who would...  Right, who's going to say no?  Who wouldn't have said, oh, let's not get him?  But he wasn't in, I agree with you, but he wasn't in the mountains of Afghanistan, where  it would have been an automatic call.  It was, we think we have him, he's in Pakistan, can we just go in and get him?  It's an automatic yes.  I don't care who's sitting in that seat, it's an automatic yes.  How do you explain to the people that you said no?  You can't, because you can't, you can't not give the guy credit when, again, you saw 
[02:10:00]  it cost Jimmy Carter a second term when he was doing the right thing.  He was trying to make a courageous rescue, and unfortunately, soldiers got killed.  Well, that could have backfired in Obama's face, it cost him a second term.  I think anybody sitting in the office would have done either one of those two things,  and either one of those two things would have been fine, either one of them.  Right.  And I think anybody sitting there, Republican, Democrat, Independent, anybody sitting in  that office would have said, go get him, one way or the other, go get him.  Hey, look, we had, in Afghanistan, when we knew bin Laden was there after 9-11, I believe 
[02:10:30]  we tried to get from the Taliban, and they wouldn't do it until we invaded, but we didn't  just go over there and grab him from Afghanistan.  We tried to get him through, quote-unquote, diplomatic means, and when we couldn't, that's  where we went to.  I think it was a lot of a different story back then.  Time changed a lot of things.  Over the years, we've had numerous chances to really get him, and people didn't react  quickly enough, and that's pretty bad.  But he got older.  He's sitting in the house.  I mean, I'll tell you, where you can really take away credit is, how do you let an ally, 
[02:11:00]  that we give billions and billions of dollars to have him sitting for many years right next  to a military academy in the biggest house in town?  Exactly.  Those bastards, Mr. Trump.  Well, it's one of those problems.  Well, it's more like, I think, you know, it's because they're, I guess, I'm assuming  it's just to keep the, who is it, Musharraf, to keep the Islamic radicals from having control  of the nukes.  I mean, it was basically just a way of keeping this radical element away from the weapons,  because then they attack Israel, and then there's a whole problem in the Middle East that 
[02:11:30]  we have to stick our noses in.  Well, that's true.  Mr. Trump, I want to talk to you about this debate, the Republican debate.  How do you feel about a lot of the pressure being put on some of these candidates to perhaps  pull out of this, the circus atmosphere that a lot of people are saying this would be?  Well, one thing I'll tell you, I have a lot of viewers.  That's one thing I do.  Well, that's true.  I do respect Gingrich for going right away.  He said, hey, look, you know, I mean, we can't be afraid of anything.  I will say that the Republican Party has put a lot of pressure on them not to be there 
[02:12:00]  because of the possibility that I may run as an independent if they choose a candidate  that I don't agree with.  And that's a possibility.  That sounds like a threat.  So they'd like me to waive that, and I'm not going to be waiving that, but they would  like me to waive it.  And I think if I waived it, everybody would show up, but I'm not going to do that.  Who do you like right now?  Well, I will tell you, I'm going to make an endorsement at some point over the next few weeks.  I will say this.  I was disappointed in Romney, very disappointed that, you know, I became very close to him 
[02:12:30]  that he wouldn't do the debate.  Bachman really doesn't have much of a chance anyway, but I was very disappointed in her  that she doesn't show up because she came up to see me four times, four times.  You know, I am busy, in all fairness, and she came up to see me.  Plus, I did her some favors and this and that, so I assumed she was a natural and she didn't  do it.  But I do like the fact that Gingrich said, hey, look, we have to deal with Chinese, we  have to deal with this, we have to deal with it, we're going to be afraid to be at a debate.  Who are we?  We're running for president.  I think that was sort of cool. 
[02:13:00]  But with all of that, I'm not going to let the debate sort of, you know, convince me as  to what's right for the country.  I'll be making an endorsement at some point.  What did you think about Cain?  He likes white chicks almost as much as you do there, Mr. Trump.  Well, I'll tell you what, I did get to know him, and he's a really nice guy.  He was a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He suffered greatly, fellas, over the last three weeks.  Oh, man.  Yeah, they, well, you know what, when you go into trying to be president of the United  States, boy, they will pry any skeleton you might have out of your closet. 
[02:13:30]  And now, now with you, Mr. Trump, do you have anything that perhaps you're a little hesitant  to run because they might, you know, be able to dig some stuff up on you?  Yeah, he's going to tell us that.  I hope not, because I watch Herman.  Let's get it out now on our show.  And I can tell you, I can tell you that when Herman walked into his house that morning  to explain everything to his wife, that was not a pleasant meeting.  Oh, I bet not.  I bet not.  How many times down the road?  How many times have you had to make that speech there, Mr. Trump?  Not too often, actually. 
[02:14:00]  Not too often.  Did you believe him?  Did you believe Cain?  I mean, because you've got to know him.  Well, I don't know.  Yeah, I believe.  I'll tell you what.  I just really liked him.  I thought he was a great guy.  But he is a womanizer.  I think it's pretty obvious.  Well, he definitely liked women.  He did something that was amazing with his personality.  He had great personality.  And with his personality, he did very well.  And then in the end, it sort of came crashing down.  But, you know, if you think about it, do you think John F. Kennedy would have survived today?  I don't know.  Absolutely.  You know, you didn't mention Rick Perry there, Mr. Trump. 
[02:14:30]  Well, Rick Perry called me.  And he said very nicely, you know, first of all, debating is not his thing, okay?  Really?  This honestly would have been a tougher debate.  This would have been a very much tougher debate than the kind of debate they had.  They didn't have tough debates.  Now, why is that, Mr. Trump?  Why do you think this debate with you at the helm there would be more difficult?  Because I think I'd be tougher than a lot of the moderators.  I'd also let them speak.  I'd also bring up things that really don't get discussed. 
[02:15:00]  We're being eaten alive from the outside, and that's from China and from other countries, OPEC, the OPEC nation.  What's a good example question that you would ask that you don't usually hear on other debates?  Well, I really would be focusing on China and why everybody's taking such a pass on China when, in fact, they're driving us into poverty.  Yeah, we're kind of looking at what amounts to be an enemy of our country, a passive enemy.  Well, they're not our friend.  I deal with China, and I have a lot of friends in China. 
[02:15:30]  And they even say to me, I can't believe what we get away with.  I can't believe you.  They actually say to me, I can't believe your leaders are so stupid.  Oh, my God.  They don't even believe it.  What they're doing to us with the manipulation of their currency, they make our products.  The funny thing, they take our money, and then they loan it back to us.  And they are laughing at us all the way to the bank.  So how do we solve that?  We have nobody.  Very simple.  Either they stop with the manipulation.  The manipulation is a huge thing because it makes it impossible for our companies to compete.  Either they stop with it, or we throw a 25% tax on all of the products that come in from China, 
[02:16:00]  which would drive them into a depression, the likes of which you have never seen.  We have all the cards.  They don't have the cards.  We have the cards.  But they have our money.  Hold on.  We just don't know that.  Don't worry about it.  Why hasn't anyone done that?  Over the years, I've owned plenty of money, and right now, I'm wealthy as hell.  Believe me, fellas, we have the cards.  They do not have the cards.  But you have a simple solution.  Why hasn't anyone done that over the years?  Because they're not intelligent.  We don't have intelligent leadership.  We don't have courageous leadership. 
[02:16:30]  We have people that shouldn't be in office.  We have people that weren't trained to be in office.  We have a president that's not a very smart person, in my opinion.  No, he was a candidate.  He was a good candidate.  He wasn't a good president.  He's not a good president.  He knew how to run for office.  He knew how to make speeches to get himself elected.  No, he knows how to raise money.  All he does is raise money.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  These fundraisers are amazing.  He gave us a 747 Air Force One to go out and do fundraisers,  and then he'll show up in New York right next to the lighting ceremony,  where I don't know if you were there this year.  It was a disaster.  People that came from all parts of the state and New Jersey, 
[02:17:00]  you couldn't get to the tree.  Right.  Because they had the streets blocked off,  because this arrogant guy comes in,  and he says,  I'm having a fundraiser at the same time as the lighting the Christmas tree.  So he couldn't do it the next day or the day before.  He had to do it when they're lighting the tree.  Every street was closed off,  and I'm telling you,  I saw people crying in the streets.  You know what?  Officially, I don't like Obama now.  Yeah, same.  That's just wrong.  Good for you.  That's just wrong.  Because I don't either.  I'm up in the air on him.  There's certain things I like about him. 
[02:17:30]  There's certain things I don't like about him.  What do you think about him?  I mean, obviously, he was not able to get what he wanted with health care.  What do you think needs to be done with that?  Well, Obamacare, as we know it,  is really going to have a huge impact, negative impact on our country,  because nobody can afford it.  I mean, you just can't afford it.  And what's happened is companies are starting,  and will start when it really kicks in in 2014.  They're going to start to close up.  And I know a lot of companies are going to be closing up,  because they can't afford this health care.  So it's a problem.  It's like blackmail for employers. 
[02:18:00]  Well, it's a real problem for people that want jobs, I can tell you.  Now, as far as jobs go, you know, you're a very wise businessman.  What would you do in this country to try to get America working again?  I would take the incentives away from people going to Mexico,  from people going to China, where they're making our products,  from people outsourcing, going to India.  You know, if you check on your credit card right now,  it's likely that somebody from India will answer the call. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  They'll answer exactly where you stand.  I mean, it is absolutely insane.  But now, Mr. Trump, how do you deal with the fact that a lot of these unions  are outpricing these companies and making them, for survival,  go overseas for employees?  Well, the unions are getting a lot weaker right now,  and they're getting more reasonable because they have really no choice.  And they are losing jobs left and right.  They are losing power.  And, frankly, you know, you look at states like Florida,  and you look at certain states, look at the Boeing situation. 
[02:19:00]  The Boeing situation is amazing, where they want to move their plant.  And the federal government is not letting them do it  because they want it to be unionized.  You know, the whole thing is incredible.  But the unions have lost a lot of sway.  Hey, look, I'm a big union guy.  I'm fine with unions.  I live in New York, and I've done very well with unions.  I like unions.  But the fact is they are having a very, very hard four or five years.  I don't like the fact that they can't compromise and would rather sit.  I think a lot of these union heads would rather have their people sit 
[02:19:30]  and not work than work for less money than their contract says.  And then people, like you said, outsource the jobs, and everyone loses.  Well, we're doing tremendous outsourcing all over the world.  And those jobs could be in Iowa.  They could be in Alabama.  I mean, it's incredible the outsourcing we're doing.  And I think we should tax outsourcing.  We have to bring the jobs back into this country.  You know, I went to the Wharton School.  I'm a big free trade guy and all that stuff.  But the one thing I learned about free trade over the last couple of years just in watching it 
[02:20:00]  is you need smart negotiators.  You need smart leadership.  And if you have dumb leadership, and these countries have smart-as-hell leadership,  you know, you look at South Korea and countries that are making deals with us  that a child wouldn't make from our standpoint.  I mean, they just would.  A child wouldn't make these deals.  And you realize why the country's doing so badly and why we owe $15 trillion,  because we lose with everybody.  You know, China this year is going to make $350 billion profit.  Let's call it profit on us.  Colombia.  Colombia, we're a small trading partner, $4 billion. 
[02:20:30]  China, though, $350 billion.  So, you know, somebody said, oh, well, we want free trade.  Who needs free trade when you have somebody doing that?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, God, we're being raped.  Do you think, here's an odd question, which is a little off the subject,  but it ties in with unions.  They're trying to legalize mixed martial arts in New York, and you're a New Yorker,  and it's continually being stopped, and it's all about a union issue in Vegas.  Wow.  Are you familiar?  I didn't know that, but it certainly should come to New York.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:21:00]  It's ridiculous that it doesn't.  It's very popular.  The Fajitas, the whole group, they've done a great job with it.  And, you know, they have it in New Jersey, and they have all the events,  and they have it in other places surrounding us.  I didn't know that that was the reason, but certainly it should be allowed to come into New York.  You should push for that.  You'd be surprised how many mixed martial arts fans you'd get on your side.  Well, I think they're on my side anyway, to be honest with you.  But I will tell you, it should absolutely be in New York,  and it's inconceivable that they don't have it.  I mean, they allow boxing, which, frankly, is being a little bit taken over by this other stuff. 
[02:21:30]  And it's amazing that they don't allow it in New York.  I'm sure it's going to happen soon, but it's incredible that it doesn't happen in New York.  You know, we haven't even mentioned your book, Mr. Trump.  Yes.  It's time to get tough, Making American No. 1 Again.  Yeah, and it's doing great, and I have a book signing today at 11 o'clock at Trump Tower on 57th and 5th,  and I hope your group and your many, many people that listen can be there.  Absolutely.  We have a huge audience, Mr. Trump.  I know you do.  Yes.  Huge.  Indeed.  And 57th and Columbus Circle there is a perfect place, 
[02:22:00]  because you're right above the subway there at Columbus Circle.  Well, actually, this is 57th and 5th Avenue.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay, I'm thinking of it.  That's a different Trump building.  That's another good Trump building, but that's Trump International Hotel.  This is Trump Tower, and this is right next to Tiffany on 57th and 5th, right next to Tiffany,  and I hope your folks can come over, and maybe you guys can even come over.  That would be even better.  Yeah, that's – and this is – how long has it been out?  It just came out a couple of days ago.  I hear it's doing great.  Yeah, I'm sure you'll probably go.  And I think you're going to endorse Newt, then. 
[02:22:30]  No, I'm not going to endorse anybody for a little while.  But, no, I was doing –  I will make a decision.  I was doing the math behind the scenes as you were talking about everybody, and I got it nailed.  You're going to endorse Gingrich.  You're going to get a feeling that he's going to –  Well, I respect him, and I respect Romney, too.  I respect a number of the candidates.  I like him, and I respect him.  I've gotten to know most of them, and I have a great deal of respect for a number of them, not all of them.  Romney looks like he's going to have a nervous breakdown at any moment.  Well, he's shocked, probably, at what happened.  This got him by – there's probably never been anything like this. 
[02:23:00]  I mean, this just got him by surprise.  It is very odd how their percentages have gone up and down and, you know, the frontrunner where you're like, oh, this guy's a shooing.  And then I think it's because they start this so far out, like two years out these days, and, you know, there's just a lot happens in the interim.  Where are you at with Sarah Palin?  I think she's a terrific woman, and she came out with a nice statement about me the other day, and I think she is a terrific woman, and she's talented, and she's got a group of people that love her, absolutely love her.  Do you think that she's – because I think she's gotten a bad rap, too. 
[02:23:30]  I think the media likes to just totally vilify her.  But I also personally wouldn't want to see her as president.  Do you think that she is qualified to either run the country or be second in command?  Well, she's better than what we have.  The answer is yes, and she's a lot better than what we have.  I mean, we have a guy in there that's not qualified at all.  He can't even get the simplest bills passed.  No.  You look at Washington, it's total gridlock, and he's out playing golf in Hawaii, and he's out playing golf in Cape Cod.  No leadership.  He doesn't know how to get his guys – he doesn't sit down and talk with his people. 
[02:24:00]  He's above everybody.  I think he actually thinks he's superior, and I wouldn't exactly say that.  Do you think, though, like a lot of politicians – let's be honest.  We have this terrible reputation for politicians.  They're all liars.  He doesn't strike me as a guy who's a typical scummy politician.  I think he was idealistic and just couldn't get done what he wanted to get done.  Well, I disagree.  I think he comes out of the Chicago group.  I think he was – I think, you know, you take a look at his house transaction, the way he got his house from Resco,  and you take a look at all of that, and you tell me. 
[02:24:30]  You give me that answer again.  I don't think you would.  I think that he is a –  It's elitism, yeah.  I think he is much different than people know.  Hey, Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about colleges and tuitions.  They're out of hand.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  They're out of hand?  Yeah.  People are leaving college with ridiculous loans that they can't –  Well, I think it's a shame.  I think it's a shame.  I also think it's a shame that students come to this country.  They go to MIT.  They go to Harvard.  They take all our space, and then we throw them out of the country, which is sort of amazing, 
[02:25:00]  and then they go back to their countries and compete with us.  Either we keep them, they want to stay, or don't educate them,  because, frankly, what are we educating people from other countries for?  That's true.  Is there any way to control tuition costs for middle-class families?  Well, you can work out deals with banks.  I mean, the banks are giving loans for that if somebody's good, but it's a difficult situation.  What do you think about the euro?  What do you think is going to happen there?  Yeah, we shorted that shit.  We're hoping to make money.  I think the euro is a mess. 
[02:25:30]  Remember one thing about the euro.  The euro was set up very strongly to hurt the United States.  Right, yeah.  So don't feel so badly.  Against the dollar.  Oh, I don't at all.  They all got together to create the euro.  Why?  To hurt the United States.  Hurt the dollar.  To compete with the United States and to compete with the dollar.  So don't feel badly.  You guys have a great show.  I have to run.  All right, Mr. Trump.  Good luck with the book.  Thank you, sir.  The signing is today at 11 a.m.  Trump Tower, 57th Street and 5th Avenue.  I hope you guys are there yourselves.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:26:00]  Time to get top.  Making America number one, Donald Trump's new book.  Thanks, Don.  Thanks a lot.  Take care.  Bye.  Yeah, what do you think of the...  I guess he likes us here.  What do you think of Mr. Trump there, sir?  I think he was all over the map.  I think he's...  Ah, Mike.  Yeah.  No, it's...  Hey, you know, he's a very entertaining guy.  Very interesting guy.  I think Donald is showbiz.  Absolutely.  It's all about...  What do you mean all over the map, though?  Give us some specifics.  Well, I mean, he's right about China.  He's right about China in the sense that China's constantly just having us over.  Is it that easy to solve by throwing that 25%? 
[02:26:30]  No.  No.  You chuck that 25% on there, and it's going to grind the entire world's economy into a mess.  Now, we have to be more serious about how we deal with them, but just saying we've got  a lump of attacks on this is not really dealing with some of the bigger problems that we're  facing with China.  I mean, every day, every day, they are probing and attacking our infrastructure, and they're  looking for information.  Whether they take it or not, they're just looking.  And if people knew the aggressiveness with which the Chinese authorities steal intellectual 
[02:27:00]  property and information, and we all stand around, and this is where Trump is, right?  We all talk about this Chinese miracle.  Oh, my God, they're going to take over the next century.  We talk in glowing terms.  I've got friends who do a great deal of business over there, and they just completely dismiss  all these issues, and we're just willing to give them a pass.  Is it the way we kind of look the other way for Islamic radicals when dealing with Saudi  Arabia?  Like, we just take the things that we like about it and then just completely turn a blind 
[02:27:30]  eye.  Right.  I mean, yeah, that's a good analogy.  You could make that argument.  But with China, it's much more devastating.  I mean, you look at how they've been able to short-circuit a lot of their progress by  essentially just taking our R&D, our intellectual property, and advancing it.  I mean, look at this.  Again, going back to this, not to disappear down the stealth drone issue again, but the first  call that was made was a Chinese saying, hey, do you mind if we stop by to take a look  at this thing?  They were on top of that tailpiece that fell off in the...  Yeah, exactly.  You know, as soon as they could get on a flight. 
[02:28:00]  And, you know, but again, we just allow this to happen.  And the education issue that he talked about, I think he's right about that.  I talked to a buddy of mine who's in this business.  He said, in 2008, 75% of all PhDs, all advanced degrees awarded in this country went to non-U.S.  citizens.  Wow.  I mean...  Yeah, that's a lot.  We're educating people and then just shipping them off.  Yeah, why are we doing that?  That really is stupid.  We're just dummies.  Well, and you talk...  And like you said about, you know, the cost of school, you know, 240% tuition increase 
[02:28:30]  in the past 15 years.  Yeah, that's my hot topic.  It doesn't make sense anymore.  I can't imagine a middle-class family sending their kids to college.  Well, and...  For what reason at this point?  So they can be in debt?  They're trying to get in.  But they can't.  And part of it is they can't compete with the overseas, you know, flow of students.  Right.  Yeah.  So I think that education-wise, costs and the way that we think about education as part  of our national security, we've got to deal with it.  Why does the country ignore that shit? 
[02:29:00]  Tuition costs going up 240% and we just all look the other way.  That's ridiculous.  It's obviously a problem.  Look at the shit we get involved in that we worry about.  That's true.  You know, Herman Cain.  I mean, you know, I like my president to like women.  You know, what do I care?  Yeah, what do I care?  That is true.  We get distracted and the real issues are too...  They're just too complicated for the American people.  They can't sum it up in a soundbite or a quick clip or a photo or a tweet.  140...  It takes more than 140 characters to talk about education. 
[02:29:30]  More importantly, I think we're on Donald Trump's good side again.  Yeah, what happened there?  I thought we were...  What were we called?  What did you call us?  The idea that I called these two slobs is laughable.  That's a quote from a New York paper.  No.  A few years ago.  No, what he's saying there is the idea that he had referred to, the idea that I would  call these guys slobs, that's laughable.  Oh, I like that.  Just need a comma, right?  Yeah, the idea that I would call these two slobs, semicolon, is laughable.  Yeah, that's punctuation.  He also said he would never again be a guest on our show. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  But we buried the hatchet.  That was years ago.  I don't want to start New Troubles.  I would love to talk politics with him.  We're on his good side.  We'll see how long it lasts.  And his son is great, man.  We have a lot of fun with him.  His son's kind of a fan of the show.  He's a cool guy.  He likes to fly fish in the same area I do.  And I don't know.  I think he had something to do with this.  How do we get Donald Trump on the show, Roland?  Yeah, what happened?  Was that you, Roland?  Don't just brag.  Let me don't brag.  Like you guys?  Take credit.  Take credit.  Oh!  Oh, shit.  Was he bashing us there? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  How you doing, Roland?  Yeah, Roland.  He didn't get dicks in the ass yesterday.  But no, from his son.  What is he talking about?  I don't know.  Somebody got dicks in the ass.  Dicks in the ass.  Why do you get dicks in the ass?  He books our show.  No, his son re-nighted the bridge.  How do you know?  Because his son said, I'm going to help you get him back on the show.  I'm going to fucking write him right now.  Yeah, that's true.  He was great.  Yeah.  I still disagree, though.  I still think he's given Obama too hard.  I think Obama has been a lot tougher in the Middle East than people give him credit for. 
[02:31:00]  Everyone thought he was going to be a complete puss in the Middle East, and his domestic policy  would be strong, and it's just the opposite.  I think the idea that you can't criticize Obama's foreign policy because he got bin Laden,  I think, is insane.  Sure, you can criticize him.  But, I mean, the agency comes to him, the CIA comes to him and says, we think we've got  solid intelligence that we've identified the location for bin Laden.  So, you know, he says, okay, fine, go back and work on it some more.  And so they do, and they come back, and they say, yeah, we think we got him.  So he says, all right, we'll come up with a plan, which is essentially what happens. 
[02:31:30]  So the agency and the military sit down, and they come up with a couple of scenarios.  They take those scenarios to him, and he says, I choose A.  And you're right, that's exactly what a president's supposed to do.  Now, I mean, you're also right, Jim.  I mean, you know, he was taking a chance, you know, by making a decision, but that's  what the hell he's getting paid for.  Anybody who's in that seat has got to get off the X and make a decision.  And so he did.  So, you know, huzzah for him, but that's the only thing he could do.  But you're right, but had it failed, or had it not been bin Laden, had it been bad  intelligence, the way Colin Powell ruined his life with bad intelligence, nobody would 
[02:32:00]  have said, I disagree with Donald Trump.  He would not have given Obama a pass on that.  They would have killed Obama for that.  But what if he said no, and it came out that we knew where he was, we had him, there was  a proposal for a mission, and Obama said no.  Obama would have looked bad, but his defense could have been, and I just played devil's  advocate, his defense could have been, we didn't know 100% that we had him, and he 
[02:32:30]  was in Pakistan, who our intelligence has been working with, and they didn't have him  listed there.  So we had to go by the, I'm just, that would have been.  Could you do that as Curly?  Could you say that as Curly?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think him, if he would have not sent people in knowing that he was there, it would have  been worse than a failed mission.  I think it would have been worse for him than a failed mission. 
[02:33:00]  Because you have got to make a decision.  Because at least he was trying to do something to get him.  If he never sent people to try to get him, it's a no-brain.  He had to sign off on it.  I agree with you.  Any president.  I agree with you on that.  But he would have gotten killed if he did, if it failed.  So you've got to give him credit when it worked.  It was still ballsy because you were going on a secret mission into the country of a  supposed ally.  That's, that's where the balls was.  If he was in Afghanistan in a mountain range, of course, without question.  But there were other things to be considered here, and he did the right thing. 
[02:33:30]  Actually, Pakistan, I don't think that's ballsy.  I think if he was in Iran, that would have been a ballsy move.  That would have been a ballsy move.  Iran, if he was in fucking North Korea.  Do you ever give Obama a pass on anything?  I've given him a couple of passes on things.  Getting Qaddafi?  I mean, look, the bottom line is, the Qaddafi thing puzzles me.  Because we supposedly did that for humanitarian reasons.  And meanwhile, Assad is killing everybody he can get his hands on.  And so we were so late in getting to the table on the Syrian issue. 
[02:34:00]  But, yeah, I give him a pass on the drone program, as an example.  You know, he's significantly ramped that up, which drives the far left crazy.  But that's been a very important part of what we've done over the past few years in trying  to degrade Al-Qaeda and their like-minded minions.  I would like to do that.  Yeah, minions.  I always like asking both sides, you know, what they give a pass on, you know, the guy  for.  Because it always seems to be, no, I got to stay strong here and, like, fucking hate him  across the board. 
[02:34:30]  And he could have looked bad by, again, all of his constituency was against him going-  That's how TV works.  It's like fucking someone on MSNBC, can you fucking-  I hate everything about the man.  No, that's-  You know what?  Give some-  Yeah.  You got to do something.  You got to give credit here and there.  Awalaki.  Yeah.  He called a hit on Awalaki.  And he should have.  Fuck him.  But he's a U.S. citizen.  The ACLU didn't want him to do it.  None of his constituency wanted him to do it.  The way he has handled that whole shit part of the world has been fucked. 
[02:35:00]  I can't believe.  Maybe it's because he wants to combat the image that he's a Muslim.  I don't know what it is.  But I think he's been so much fucking more ferocious with that that I never thought he  was going to be terrible.  Part of it is you got the benefit of that activity is a bit hands-off, right?  I mean, some of those things that are done-  Iraq, Afghanistan, it's in your kitchen constantly, right?  But the drone program and going after some of these high-value targets, it's a little  bit of a standoff.  And so, you know, it happens back here behind the scenes.  It's like Guantanamo not closing, right?  Right, right, right. 
[02:35:30]  Who remembers Guantanamo anymore?  Yeah.  I agree.  You can't-  The problem we got right now is that nobody is willing to say, look, I like a couple of  things from here, and I like some of the things from over here.  Like you said, it's got to be all, I fucking hate all of this, or I love all of this.  Right.  If we stay on that path, we're completely fucked.  I think we're in trouble, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  We got a guy who goes, you deal with college by saving before your child is born.  But, you know, if you're having a child now, and these tuition costs continue to go up  like they are, you're not going to be able to afford it. 
[02:36:00]  You're not short the year off.  I got a four-month-old.  All right.  A four-month-old.  I got, what does that mean?  I got 17 years to try to save for his education, but I got two others just a little bit older than  that one, and I got one that's getting ready to go into college.  And people are talking somewhere between $70,000 and $120,000 is about the average.  You're in debt that much after you get out of college.  That's crazy.  The world needs ditch-diggers, too, you know.  Why would you even go to college?  You could be ahead of the game by almost $100,000. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  By not having a degree.  And I think, and we'll also get to a point where nobody can build shit anymore, right?  Right.  Because everybody wants to go to college.  We've raised up this idea, which is, you know, okay, that's admirable, but get a trade.  I mean, a lot of these kids, shit, if I was getting my liberal arts degree right now, and  I was looking at the job market, I'm thinking, okay, as soon as I finish this, I'm going  into air conditioning school.  I'm going to do something where I can build something.  Yeah, yeah.  I had to pay for my own college if I was 18 right now.  There's no fucking way I would put myself into that shit.  There was not a chance my parents were going to pay for college. 
[02:37:00]  So why would I do that?  Yeah.  $100,000 in debt?  Get your anthropology degree.  Well, in my case-  Get your anthropology on.  Communications, it worked out for me, but, you know, it doesn't work out for a lot of  fucking people after they invest that much money.  Remember John Ratzenberger came in, and that's what he was promoting, was that people don't  build, from Cheers, he's got a charity, I forget what it's called, but where people  don't build things anymore, and they're trying to encourage people to actually learn trades  and build things.  I think that's what he was doing.  I, well, my problem was I refused to be in the same room as the guy, so I didn't get 
[02:37:30]  to hear what he had to say.  I have a real problem with that fucking guy.  Oh, Jesus.  Let's take a break.  Yeah, you remember.  I wasn't here.  Fuck that.  I remember.  Oh, he was good.  Yeah, he was good.  I had to go.  I threw out darkness for myself.  You did.  Mike Baker is here.  We still have to take a break.  Donald Trump's new book.  He's in?  We're pals with Donald Trump again?  How the fuck did that happen?  It was all because I did Leno with him.  Ah.  Oh, that could have been it.  Yeah.  He's lying.  He's lying.  I did do it with him.  Oh, you did that time?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:38:00]  And he is going to endorse Newt Gingrich.  I can't do that, Reed.  I agree.  You do it.  More with Mike Baker.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, yes.  Mike Baker in studio.  Yes, Mike. 
[02:38:30]  It's quite a come down after Donald Trump.  No, not at all.  Blaze.  Not at all.  I like your insight on a lot of the shenanigans going on around the world.  I may call them shenanigans.  There's a lot of shenanigans.  A lot of shenanigans.  I got a great question for Mr. Baker.  We'll be the judge of that.  No, it's a great one.  Tom Cruise confirmed that he'll be in Top Gun 2.  What?  Is he going to be one of the...  He's going to star in Top Gun 2?  He's going to be one of the guys, the trainers, one of the...  At this point, he'd have to be like the admiral on the carrier. 
[02:39:00]  He's really got to be like...  Come on.  He's not going to be that young, gruff maverick, I don't think.  He's going to be Cookie.  Cookie.  The galley chef.  Well, I guess Kelly McGillis isn't going to be in hell.  Oh, hell no.  Well, maybe she could play a dude.  Yeah, she could play one of the guys.  She could play a dude.  In the locker room.  The janitor.  On the flight line, guys.  You see what she looks like these days there, Mike Baker?  Yeah, it's not good. 
[02:39:30]  Talk about just leaving something on the shelf.  Are they so lacking in creativity that this is...  You know, let's just rehash this shit.  Well, I think they are.  We've got three Stooges coming out.  You've got Top Gun 2 coming out.  And we barely talked about, but...  Excuse me.  American Psycho they're going to remake.  Why?  I loved American Psycho.  Yeah, but why do you have to remake that?  You don't have to remake it.  I hear the book is brutal, so maybe they want to go even darker or something.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Do you laugh at war movies?  Are any of them accurate?  War movies, espionage movies, spy thrillers. 
[02:40:00]  Give me one that made you go, you know what?  All right.  They did a pretty good job at this one.  Well, from an entertainment value, the Bourne movies.  Just from entertainment.  You know, where you don't sit there and go, you've got to be kidding me.  Because they're so, you know, they're so well-paced and, you know, it's good shit.  Right.  From where you actually sit and look at it and go, you know, they kind of got this part of it right.  You kind of, you've got to go old school.  Something like, there was an old series called Tinker Tailor, Soldier Spy.  I was just going to mention that. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, it's a movie now.  It's a movie now.  Yeah, well, that's...  And now we're talking about the same thing.  It was a brilliant, brilliant old BBC drama.  And they're going to remake it.  And I guarantee you, it's going to be full of car chases and explosions.  I've seen it.  Gary Oldman's in it.  Jimmy saw it.  Gary Oldman's in it.  And they're slow.  But the paper's giving it really good reviews.  Amazing reviews.  It's a slow movie, though.  It's not at all.  There's not one car chase.  Okay.  Well, in that case, they're sticking close to the original formula.  Because, you know, before it was all, it was a mind game. 
[02:41:00]  And there was a lot of talk, which, you know, could bore some people.  But, you know, it was Cold War espionage.  It was good shit.  But, yeah, for the most part, you go.  And it drives my wife crazy if we see a movie.  Because I'm sitting there going, oh, come on, please.  And she says, can't you just enjoy the thing?  And I'm getting, you know, I'm getting curmudgeonly.  I can't enjoy anything.  You're just picking it apart?  No, I wouldn't have done that.  I remember that.  And it didn't happen that way. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  That American Psycho thing, what?  It's going to be done in present day instead of the 80s.  But the whole 80s thing made it kind of fun.  Yeah, man.  The Huey Lewis and the Noons.  Going to return some videocapes.  Sushi Studio.  Yes.  This is Phil Collins.  Right.  Yeah.  That movie was fucking great.  Oh, boy.  What's the matter?  Oh, I got something.  No, Roland's got the problem with somebody.  That's all I know.  What did you get Roland in here? 
[02:42:00]  Roland!  That's all I know.  Why do you think he's a problem?  He's talking about dicks in the ass.  Maybe he meant that in a good way.  And then he took a shot at us that we're, what?  Maybe he was being positive or something.  Yeah, how was you doing?  I got a couple of dicks in the ass.  Like, wow, home runs.  You want to hear something really fast before Roland?  Sure.  That Troy put together?  Anything.  You want a ramped up version or a basic version?  I like the basic.  Basic?  All right, listen to this.  Are we on the air right now?  Are we on the air? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, you guys are on the air.  You guys are on the air right now?  Are we on the air?  I'm on the fucking air.  What are you guys doing?  Are you on air?  I can't tell you how many guests actually asked us, are we on the air?  I don't know if that's good or bad.  Are we about to go on?  We're kind of on.  That's what we do.  We're not on the fucking thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We do that.  Are we on radio?  Yes.  Are we on the radio right now?  We just bring it in and let it roll.  Are we on?  Yeah.  Yeah, we just do it in.  Are we on?  Yeah, we're on.  Yeah.  Are we actually on the air right now?  Yes, we're on the air.  Send them a sign, a red sign. 
[02:43:00]  And that's all actual audio.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all.  We didn't get guys into a production studio.  That's actually a lot of people asking if they're on the air.  What is it with this show?  Because people do come in and we're on the air.  And they sit down and go, hey, how you doing?  Oh, we on the air?  It's an automatic question.  It's like, what time is it there?  Yeah, yeah.  What time is it there?  Did I wake you up?  It's just because it's a hang, you know?  Yeah.  It doesn't feel like we're on the radio.  We're chatting.  We do it wrong.  I guess we bring guests in wrong.  Yeah, I guess. 
[02:43:30]  Because they usually know when they're coming in and on the air, right?  Roland, what's going on with you?  Roland, what's the matter?  Nothing.  You're talking about dicks in the ass.  Nothing.  I get a dick in the ass every time.  You're saying you have...  You say dicks in the ass all the time.  No, you said you got a dick in the ass.  I used to be a dick in the ass.  I'm not happy.  Nothing.  What?  Nothing.  Everything's good, right?  Yeah.  I'm just trying to get everything wrapped up before the publicist...  Mike was with the agency.  I want to see if we can crack the code that is Roland speaking.  I was just listening to him.  I'm thinking we got it. 
[02:44:00]  We're going to have to work him over.  Yeah, yeah.  A little waterboarding.  If you got time for some sleep deprivation.  Sam's rolling his eyes a little bit, Sam.  Well, I don't know what's wrong.  But yesterday he said he had just gotten a dick in the ass.  And then just like half an hour ago you said yesterday I had to take a dick in the ass.  But today is okay.  Was it the same dick?  Yeah, exactly.  Did they at least worship?  What's happened, Roland?  Oh, nothing.  I'm just trying to get everything wrapped up because the publicity firm shut down next week.  Publicy firm.  Publicy firm.  The publicity firm. 
[02:44:30]  No, you said publicity.  Was there some kind of issue?  No.  You're hinting at it.  Publicy firm.  No, no.  No, they all shut down.  So I have to get everything just shifting and moving things.  So you're just getting dicks in the ass for nothing?  No dicks in the ass.  But you said dick in the ass.  He'll put three words together into one word.  Yeah, he's busy.  That's how Roland gets things done because he doesn't fuck around with words.  No, fuck words.  But he hinted that he got a dick in the ass.  But now he's saying no dick in the ass.  No dick in the ass.  It's just shifting people that were going to be able to come in this month or now coming 
[02:45:00]  in next month.  Oh, yeah.  That's a dick in the ass?  A little bit.  So I just had to shift around and move things around.  Sam?  You buying this?  If Roland says it, Roland's.  I'm not here to be Roland's lie detector.  You seem like you're mad or something.  Oh, I'm tired.  Yeah, he doesn't seem angry today.  I have a company coming over.  Who's the company?  Bruce?  My brother's coming and his new wife.  New wife? 
[02:45:30]  Now, what's this about?  Are they married?  Dick in the ass.  Dick in the ass.  When did they get married?  Last week.  Are they going to sleep on the couch?  Did you know they were getting married?  I wanted them to, but I lost my bed.  No.  I wish they did, but no.  They're sleeping in my room.  So is this their honeymoon?  Yes.  Yes, yes.  Are you bothered that your honeymoon is?  What a honeymoon?  That's a great honeymoon.  Your pillow is going to be used to prop up her ass.  Honey, wait until I tell you what I've got planned for you.  Yeah, hold on. 
[02:46:00]  If you're going to fuck, just, I'll go for pizza or something.  You're going to see a movie.  You want to sit in the living room and jerk off?  Oh, shit.  I would walk around naked just to make him uncomfortable.  I call it naked man.  That would do it.  If you ever piss me off, I call it naked man.  I just walk around naked, and they're like, oh, fuck.  Do you have a big penis?  You call it naked man?  Do you have a big penis?  I don't know.  How big is your penis?  I don't know.  How do you not know?  How do you not know?  Everyone knows.  Never look down there.  You'll hold it every day. 
[02:46:30]  How do you not know?  Yeah.  Do you have a good penis, average, or is it small?  I say average penis.  Oh, boy.  You're going to ask my two-year-old.  It's massive.  It's huge.  You don't want to be humble about the size of your penis.  You get no points for being humble.  We're rolling about five, I'd say, about five.  I'm starting to think my kid's going to have a big dick.  Congratulations.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Mazel tov.  It's called his father. 
[02:47:00]  It's off to a good start.  His penis is off to a good start.  It's always a good start.  Nice hog.  Yeah, he's got a hog.  What about yours, Mike?  Oh, yeah.  And you know what?  There's nothing they'd rather do than just hold their Johnsons all day long.  I mean, they'll sit on the TV.  You'll watch TV.  They've got their hands down their pants.  Stroke.  You know what?  And my wife looks at her like she said, what the hell are they doing?  I said, what do you do?  That's exactly what they do.  That's what they do.  I mean, as I'm telling her, I've got my hands down my pants. 
[02:47:30]  Nothing wrong with that.  No.  A little below average, then, if you're saying average, I guess.  We all over-represent.  Are you about five?  Represent.  Four and a half, probably.  No, not that small.  Five.  Ish.  Ish.  About five and a quarter?  Yeah.  You're severely average.  Roland wants out so bad.  He doesn't like this one.  I want to know what Roland's cock looks like.  I'm not being, I love Roland.  Just grab that sound, please. 
[02:48:00]  What is your...  Have that on the ready.  No, no, don't.  That'll make me look stupid.  Oh, yeah.  That will, of course I will.  I'll be tired next week to whip it out.  Is it safe to say you don't have a peener?  A peener?  A teeny wiener.  A teeny wiener is a peener.  No, that's Eric.  No.  Eric has a little one.  Eric has a little one, you think?  Oh, boy.  A little Florida penis?  Safe to assume.  What are you basing that intel on?  What?  You think he has a small one?  I don't know.  Probably not.  You think he's got a nice one?  I think Yorok's got a fucking hog. 
[02:48:30]  You do?  No, Yorok's probably about six and a quarter.  I think God bless him with everything.  I think based on when he's been in his boxer briefs and stuff, I've taken plenty of looks.  Oh, I have you seen that.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  He's quite a mission.  I think he's very endowed in the testicle area.  He's all bald.  He's a lot of bald.  It's like big hat, no cattle, all balls, no dick.  Same thing.  Who did have a giant penis bulge? 
[02:49:00]  Wait, you know the answer to this?  I do.  Can you tell me?  Who?  Jonathan.  Jonathan's got it.  I've been saying it for years.  Oh, that was so funny.  Jimmy was pointing at it the other day.  I was like, look at his penis.  Look at his penis.  Look at his penis.  He likes tight pants.  How fucking big is his hog?  He's got a, I don't know, he's got a massive bulge.  It's a massive bulge.  He does.  It couldn't be all bald.  It's a massive bulge.  We were talking about it when we were in Harrisburg and Norton texted Jim Florentine while we were just sitting eating. 
[02:49:30]  And he just goes, and randomly, hey Jim, who has the biggest bulge that we know?  And Florentine, without saying, why would you ask me this, texted him back, Jonathan.  Jonathan.  Jonathan and a comedian named Paul Veneer.  And that's why Paul Veneer had a big bulge.  I mean, me and Jim would always ask him, like, what are you packing?  How big is it?  He was like, argh.  He would never tell us how big his penis was.  Wow.  He just needs to keep it secret.  Jonathan's fucking packing a huge hog, though. 
[02:50:00]  I look every time I see him now.  That's all you should do.  I do business like that.  Just, come on, just tell me.  You kind of got to look, I think.  You sure you have.  I don't want to touch it.  I just think it's hilarious.  You know, that's why this is the greatest show on radio.  Why?  Because I can come in here.  I know I'm going to get asked a question about, you know, like, the drone.  What's going on with the drone?  What's happening in Iran?  And yet, then we can turn around and start talking about it.  This is the best.  This is the absolute best.  My manager has one in his pants.  A giant, thick, wingless drone. 
[02:50:30]  You just want to point at it and laugh.  You just want to laugh at it.  I want to poke it, like, angrily.  Like I'm arguing with it.  Like it's the chest of a bully.  Having a dispute with it, yes.  Has he ever admitted he has a big one?  I'm sure you've brought it up.  He slipped one time when he was quoting a girl.  But, you know, he won't talk about it.  Scream?  No.  When he was just quoting her and said something awkward she said in front of another girl.  What did he say?  You can't say it?  Something about his big old dick.  But it was something like that thing. 
[02:51:00]  But Jonathan doesn't talk that way.  He doesn't talk about loads.  He's a gentleman.  Yes.  He doesn't talk about sex with his wife.  He doesn't talk about sex with chicks.  He's very well-traveled.  How ironic is that?  He's a nice man.  Yeah, but what a waste of a big dick then.  Yeah, you're not going to talk about it.  I think he uses it.  You've got to use it.  I think he's probably a piece of shit, but he just doesn't talk about it.  Like he doesn't talk about it like sex once in a while.  He's like, yeah, yeah.  He doesn't start repeating himself and groaning.  I'm like, oh, he's garbage.  But he just is not verbal with it.  Is he a cocksmith?  I think he is. 
[02:51:30]  A cocksmith.  Yeah, he probably is.  He's a real cocksman.  He can't have a bulge like that and not know what he's doing with it.  You can't.  Especially because he wears tight slacks that show off the bulge.  Slacks?  Yeah.  Slacks.  Slacks.  He wears like tight European jeans.  Yeah, it's creepy.  It's tailored right around his crotch.  I don't know what's going on.  He knows so many powerful people in Hollywood and stuff.  I literally thought that he was a male escort.  He's got my turn.  What did you say?  Ant's leaving.  Ant's going to...  I got things to do.  What do you have to do?  You have a show to do.  What? 
[02:52:00]  Show is one of the things.  Yeah, I did it.  Oh, it's over?  That's it?  We were just talking about bulges and dicks.  Sold out tonight.  7 o'clock show.  There might be some tickets tomorrow at Doylestown.  Next week is...  You want to do one of these or...  Hold on a second.  You're going to go.  Next week is Sweet Basil Restaurant in Queensbury, New York.  The 16th and 17th.  They're my last gigs of the year.  Take care, buddy.  Ant's also got a big bulge.  Ant's got a fucking good dick. 
[02:52:30]  Ant's got a fat dickhead.  Ant's a feist.  Yeah.  Ant's got a fat, lazy bulge.  You could tell when he's sitting there and his pants ride up a little bit.  Yeah.  He's got big bulges.  Yeah.  He's looking at bulges, man.  It's important to know everybody.  You've got to look at one every once in a while, but you're looking at everyone, Sam.  That's fucked up.  That's where it's fucked up.  Everybody that I'm at all close with, I like to know how they fill their pants out.  Can we get some of these live reads done?  How many we got?  Four.  Four.  Let's all take a turn, man.  Everybody wants one? 
[02:53:00]  I'm going to pass it on.  I'll do one right now.  Okay, you get one?  Yeah, I'll do a good job, too.  Mike, you can have one.  Mike doesn't get paid for this.  Neither do I.  I don't mind.  I don't mind.  I'm happy to do it.  It's pro bono.  Here's an important one.  One for Roland.  Okay, folks.  If you know anyone who has an iPad or an iPhone, and we all do know someone that has one or  probably both of those things, you know they're crazy in love with them.  And if you've got an iPad geek on your holiday gift list, there's only one place to go.  Okay, folks.  If you know anyone who has an iPad or an iPhone, that's Brookstone.  It's Jim's turn. 
[02:53:30]  Brookstone is the place for all the coolest cases.  Why can't we echo this shit?  Chargers and music systems for iPads and iPhones.  They've got an iPad case with a Bluetooth wireless keyboard.  It's hard to understand.  You can type fast through all your emails.  And Facebook posts.  Or you can get Rover the wireless spy tank.  Argentium.  It steers by Wi-Fi.  It steers by Wi-Fi.  And streams live video.  And streams live video. 
[02:54:00]  It's pretty amazing, actually.  And photos back to your iPad.  And photos back to your iPad.  This is terribly written.  It steers via Wi-Fi and streams live video and photos back to your iPad.  It even has an infrared camera to see in the dark, which is pretty impressive.  If your friend isn't a music or streaming radio, get them a big blue wireless Bluetooth speaker.  Big sound.  Small package.  No docks.  There's no cords.  It's wireless.  That would mean no cords.  If you know anyone with an iPad or an iPhone, go to Brookstone to find a Brookstone store near you or shop online. 
[02:54:30]  It's brookstone.com.  They have the Bluetooth wireless keyboard.  Type fast through all your emails and Facebook posts.  And get Rover the wireless spy tank.  Steers by Wi-Fi and streams live video and photos back to your iPad.  Wires suck.  Yeah.  And this is what I want to say, Sam.  Yeah?  Remember what Jimmy just did?  Uh-huh.  Just remember that.  Okay, but it's not your turn to go right now.  Yeah, that means mine's done now, too.  No.  If they remember Jimmy's, then I'm good.  You can't just remember it. 
[02:55:00]  Jimmy just said all this.  No, there's a new one.  It's not your turn.  So now all I'm saying to the people, remember what Jimmy said and how great it is, Brookstone.com,  and now I don't have to do mine.  Yes, you absolutely do, but it's not your turn, so you're not going to do it yet.  Fuck.  It's Mike Baker's turn.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, you put on his reading glasses.  I did.  I did.  I got to get my glasses on.  Good seeing you, Mike.  Take care, buddy.  Thanks, man.  Hey, you're leaving, too?  Yeah.  He's finished.  Do you know a woman who's always cold, this is the pinnacle of my career, who is always 
[02:55:30]  turning up the heat on the thermostat, and you know what she'd love for the holidays?  Exactly.  She'd love to have hoodie footie pajamas from pajamagram.com.  It's super comfortable, and yes, that's my phone ringing now.  People are ordering the hoodie footie on my phone.  You know, Jimmy tried one of those on, Mike.  Pajamagram.com.  All right.  What's that?  The super comfortable pajama that will keep her warm while still looking great.  A hoodie footie combines the warmth of a hoodie with a coziness of footed pajamas.  It's exactly what you would think. 
[02:56:00]  There are loads of great styles to choose from, including holiday prints and a leopard  print for her wild side.  Who doesn't like to see a woman in a leopard print?  A gift for both of you to enjoy.  They make it easy.  They do.  They really make it easy.  I've got several of these already.  Every hoodie footie is delivered by Pajamagram with free gift packaging inside, so you can wrap  it up.  To order a hoodie footie, shop online at pajamagram.com.

[02:56:30]  Overnight and Christmas delivery are guaranteed.  Visit pajamagram.com or call 1-800-GIVE-PJS.  That's pajamagram.com.  Now, we should do a little material in between the reads, right?  I think so.  Good job, Mike.  Especially since it's only 38 minutes after the hour.  I think Mike did a good job.  He did a great job.  On the show?  I would be on the show, just on the read.  On the read, he was good.  Mike, have you back for a read, so you don't have to have me on the show.  I'll just do a read.  Are you still on Fox a lot?  I am, yeah.  I'm going to be on, I think, before the end of the year.  I haven't been on in a while.  Try to get on next Friday. 
[02:57:00]  I'm subbing for Andy.  Who's hosting the show now?  I think Greg.  Oh, Greg still is.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  No.  I think Greg is off.  So Andy's hosting, and so I'm subbing for Andy.  It's very complicated.  On Friday?  On Friday.  Oh.  Andy moves up.  You move into Andy's slot.  Right.  Exactly.  Nice.  The, uh...  And if Andy should mysteriously disappear, I'm not saying it would happen.  And you're the guy?  Yeah.  You're the Speaker of the House.  Could be.  You're basically the...  You're the Tip O'Neill of Red Eye.  I told Andy.  Ex-Speaker of the House, of course.  Yes, it really was.  I remember that one. 
[02:57:30]  That was very good.  I told Andy many times.  That bit he does is great.  It's a great bit.  Yeah.  Just to be paying attention the whole time and then just fucking asking...  It's tough.  I think it's the toughest part of that show.  It's different, though.  It's very unique.  Yeah.  Anything else going on?  I think the 28th.  28th of what?  Cool.  28th of December.  I haven't done Red Eye in a long time.  But I think that's the one I'm doing it.  Yeah, I joined the world of Twitter a couple weeks ago.  What's your Twitter name?  Yeah, I've only tweeted a few times, but...  What's your Twitter name?  See what helped me.  It's MB underscore company man. 
[02:58:00]  Underscore.  I know.  I don't create it.  It was made for me.  I don't know.  My social media director made it for me.  Your social media director did not do a good job with that name.  What do I know?  MB underscore.  Who wants to say that?  I don't say that.  I know.  I know.  We're going to get you a better...  That's horrible.  It is.  I know.  That's why I've only got...  You should have been CIA Mike Baker.  I got a very small nation of followers.  MB underscore company man.  The score company man. 
[02:58:30]  What is an underscore?  Is that the low line or the high line?  Which line is that?  It's somewhere on the keyboard to the right.  How many followers do you have?  Going on like that.  2,600.  Something like that.  All right.  They can all be moved over to a new one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This works.  All right.  So can you sign him up for that real quick?  Wait.  Don't say what it is.  It's before anyone takes it.  Wait.  Let me see.  We're getting you a better tweet.  Your Twitter name stinks.  Look at this.  Wait.  Is it a good name?  I'm going to have to fire my current social media director.  You...  We don't even have a social media director. 
[02:59:00]  How do you get one of those?  Rob Cosses.  Rob Cosses.  Do you know your password for the left of him?  If you want to just type it in, you don't have to do anything.  I'm supposed to have a password?  Oh.  He doesn't even know how Twitter works.  Because...  He's crazy.  He can change it later.  Because...  You're CIA.  You should know this shit.  He's crazy.  He's crazy.  You know what?  Who knows?  I didn't even know you had 140 characters until...  Everything I sent out was incomplete.  He'll lose his followers.  People will say, what's wrong with this guy?  He can't finish his sentence.  Okay.  Because you can change your username without...  Because if I sign up for that, you'll have to ask these people to go to the new one. 
[02:59:30]  To go there as opposed...  Okay.  If he signed in, we'll just change the username.  Do you know how...  You can't sign into your own Twitter account?  No, he can't.  Tell you...  You should be Twittering yourself.  Don't just...  Don't be Ashton Kutcher.  You don't need your social media...  Because you're more interesting than he is.  Okay.  He's only going to plug.  Social media people are dummies.  Like...  Let me see.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like...  Iran learns more about stealth drone capabilities from anonymous high-level UFS officials yapping 
[03:00:00]  to the New York Times than from taking apart the drone.  I wrote that.  I wrote that.  I'm sure you...  That sounds like you.  You should be writing your own shit.  Nobody writes any shit for me.  I write all that shit myself.  You should tweet your own shit.  Oh, yeah.  It's just...  I don't know how these things get set up, and that's what they did.  Get it on your phone and just tweet yourself.  Oh, it's on your phone.  I see.  But I'll take that.  I'll take that.  Take the new Twitter name and talk to your guy, and he'll change over.  That's great.  And I'm not going to say what it is out loud, because there would be thousands of people  trying to take that.  Yes.  Of course.  Or something close to it.  But, I mean, just...  If that number's no good, just use another number. 
[03:00:30]  Okay, folks.  Wait.  It's not your turn, Opie.  I hope you weren't going to start reading that.  Who tells me when it's my turn?  Sam, apparently, the new producer of the show.  I've been the producer of the show for a while.  No, but I mean the producer.  What was Travis doing in there?  Travis, can I go now?  It's not his turn, Travis.  You can do whatever you want, Sam.  It's not his turn.  Thank you, Travis.  It's Roland's turn.  Thank you.  Roland's reading?  Okay, folks.  If you know anyone who has an iPad or iPhone, you know they're crazy in love with them.  And if you've got an iPad geek on your holiday gift list, there's only one place 
[03:01:00]  to go, and that's Brookstone.  I like the Brookstone.  Yes.  Brookstone is the place for all the coolest cases, chargers, and music systems for iPad and iPhone.  They've got an iPad case with a Bluetooth wireless keyboard, so you can type fast through all  your emails and Facebook posts.  Or you can get Rover, the wireless spy tag.  I've seen this thing.  It's kind of cool.  It steers by Wi-Fi and streams live video and photos back to your iPad.  It even has an infrared camera to see in the dark.  If your friend is into music or streaming radio, get them a big blue wireless Bluetooth 
[03:01:30]  speaker, big sound, small package, no docks or cords.  If you know anyone with an iPad or an iPhone, go to Brookstone to find a Brookstone store near  you, or you can do it online.  Shop online.  Visit Brookstone.com.  That was good.  That was very good.  Let's break it down.  That was a pretty good live read by me, huh?  Yep.  I didn't stumble too much.  I didn't stammer through that one.  Not bad.  I knew where all the periods were on that one.  Punctuation was on point.  Right on board, right?  Grammar was good.  Thank you. 
[03:02:00]  Dictation, awesome.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Inflection.  Inflection was fantastic.  Inflection was good, Mike Baker.  Yeah, I liked it.  I liked it.  You did a really good job, Opie.  Thank you, Sam.  But it wasn't your turn.  Travis, was it my turn?  It's always your turn.  It's your show.  Thank you, Travis.  That's not the case.  Thank you.  Is it going to bother you that I went out of turn, Sam?  Yes.  It bothers me right now.  Sam's got a thing where he needs to be in charge.  I hate to do this, but I have to leave before Roland's read, and I apologize for that.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  My chopper's outside waiting.  Huge. 
[03:02:30]  Dick.  I've got to go.  How great.  I've got to go.  The only guy that leaves by going up in the elevator.  How cool would that be?  That would be the greatest life.  Mike Baker, it's always a pleasure.  Thanks, man.  It's a great show.  We're not going to give out your Twitter account because we're going to have a new one for you  soon.  Fantastic.  Or do they all transfer over?  They will.  Yeah.  Actually, follow MB underscore.  That's why you don't do underscore.  You don't even know how to say it properly.  MB underscore underscore company man.  See? 
[03:03:00]  Everybody who follows gets a free hoodie footy.  Whoa.  MB underscore company man on Twitter.  And then once you get the new name, they'll transfer over.  Look at mine.  It's just OP radio.  Yeah.  No, I get it.  See how easy that was?  I get it.  Even I can't find the underscore.  And I would have went with OP, but some asshole got it before me.  So I just added the other thing important.  Yeah.  Radio.  I got it.  No, I'm going for this one that you guys gave me.  But thanks very much.  Great.  Mike Baker, always a pleasure to come by and see us before the holidays. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  Jewish?  Me?  I have Jewish friends.  No, happy Christmas, everybody.  All right.  Good.  Take care, man.  All right.  Mike Baker, everyone.  Roland, it's to you, I guess.  You left your read over here, Roland.  Oh, man.  This is a giant cock.  Roland's been pushing the buttons.  Why are you pushing buttons, Roland?  I don't know.  I like that the show today is just sort of, it's like Survivor, The Last Man Standing.  Oh, man.  Roland, you want me to do yours? 
[03:04:00]  Yes, please.  Or you want Kenny to do yours?  Kenny, actually, the...  Kenny, can you do a live read?  They'll like this one.  And the person...  With enthusiasm.  All right.  Let me just put on my reading glasses.  Is our car out front?  We still have to go to...  Kenny?  Is our car out front?  No, because I...  You have to do the live read.  Argentium exclamation point.  No.  What?  That means you have to say Argentium. 
[03:04:30]  No, I do it good.  Are you chewing gum?  Yeah, I just put it in my mouth.  Why don't you just put it in your mouth before you come in here?  I didn't think I was going to be on the air, but I'm an entertainer, so I'll entertain now.  Stick it behind your ear while you're doing this.  It's kind of rude that you're chewing gum and doing the live read for the client.  I'll comment about it on my Facebook page.  I'm not asking you what your Facebook page is.  Don't.  He's just looking for it.  What is Argentium?  Question mark.  Question point.  Does anyone know what Argentium is? 
[03:05:00]  Question mark.  I'll tell you what it is, period.  It's Steven Singer's new super silver collection, exclamation point.  That's right, comma.  Steven Singer's brand new collection of silver is made from Argentium, comma.  The king of all silver metals, period.  This brand new collection.  That period worked there. 
[03:05:30]  Hey, G.H.  Yeah, that worked.  That one.  Do you notice what I'm doing, G.H.?  I like it.  It's clever.  You notice what I'm doing?  What are you doing?  Look.  Oh, Jesus.  What's he doing?  Well, when he drives us somewhere, Jim Norton tweeted about this over the weekend.  Stop chewing the gum.  Where did you guys drive to?  Baltimore.  Yeah, last weekend.  And Jim Norton tweeted that Kenny, even though they were a mere 10, 20 miles from the hotel,  was still holding the directions in his left hand, and he always has to put his thumb on the direction he's at. 
[03:06:00]  So you're putting it on the line that you're at on the live read?  Yeah, I can't lose my place.  Of course not.  That would be unprofessional.  You don't know how easily distracted I am.  There are times I have to give Kenny stuff in the morning, and he picks me up, and he refuses to put it down.  He has to hold it and drive at the same time.  Because otherwise he'll forget.  Yeah.  I don't know.  A bright light might come on or a sound.  It's really strange.  It's really strange.  Yeah.  Let me continue.  Sure, Kenny.  Sorry, Kenny.  This brand new collection of super silver starts at just dollar sign 149, which translates to $149. 
[03:06:30]  Oh.  Argentium is more pure than sterling silver.  I'll take your word for it.  You don't need to add live.  No.  I mean, you know, I don't know the veracity of this, but Steven Singer has integrity.  You're right.  No, you're right to do that.  Yes.  Don't laugh over my line when I say Steven Singer has integrity. 
[03:07:00]  Sam, my cheap Twitter plug only got me three new followers.  Not Sam on Twitter.  Just a little social experiment.  Oh, I see.  What about Facebook slash Club Soda Kenny?  Oh.  Nothing came in yet.  Oh.  Nothing at all.  People are hating the gum, by the way.  It's so annoying.  Tommy Smith wants to strangle you.  Well, I'm almost done.  No, you're not.  You're halfway through the read.  Have a good weekend.  Brighter than platinum, comma, white gold and sterling silver. 
[03:07:30]  Low maintenance, exclamation point.  Tarnish resistant and argentium is responsible and ethical.  Why, comma, I mean, question mark?  It's produced using only recycled silver.

[03:09:00]  Happy Holidays!  And goodbye!  How long was that live read?  Well, I was interrupted by you and Opie.  You're right.  Travis, do you have an approximate time on how long it might have been?  Approximate time that it started?  Yeah.  9.47.  Okay, so that was...  Four minutes ago.  Four minutes.  Yeah, so he gets his money's worth.  He gets four times his money's worth.  Yeah, because I hate Steven Singer.  I've heard.  Dot com. 
[03:09:30]  Another plug.  That counts for the read, then.  Yeah, and if anybody wants to say hello to me, I'll be in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, but  the shows might be sold out, but you could try.  I think that Jim said there were a few tickets for one show left.  Yeah, you could try, because, you know, Jim Norton is very popular.  I've heard.  Next weekend, Sweet Basil's Restaurant and Comedy Club in Queensbury, New York.  I bet you that Matt from Queensbury will be there.  I'll bet you. 
[03:10:00]  I'll bet you anything he'll be there.  That'd be a wise bet to make.  Yeah.  Bragada, Martin Luther King Weekend.  Martin Luther King will not be there.  Why is that?  It'll be the antisocial comedy show with Norton, Attell, Artie Lang, and Doug Stanhope.  That sounds exciting.  Yeah.  Maybe you'll go, Sam.  I would love to go to that.  All right.  Reserve your room.  Then Norton's going to Tempe Improv in January, and Bananarers in Poughkeepsie in February. 
[03:10:30]  Tickets are on sale now.  Well, that's an exciting show, especially for Poughkeepsie.  I mean, they love Norton there.  Yeah, no, he's very popular in Poughkeepsie.  Maybe Walter Conley will go to Bananarers.  Who's Walter Conley?  You know.  I don't know who Walter Conley is.  There's Sway.  Who's Sway Calloway?  Yeah.  He's got sunglasses and the hat on.  He always wears the hat. 
[03:11:00]  Sunglasses indoors?  How do you feel about that?  The sun's always shining when you're cool.  I guess that's true.  All right.  I guess I should go get the car since everybody else left.  They're probably waiting for me.  They're gone.  Well, you got Ant's car for him, I guess.  Yeah, he's gone.  Jim and Opie are waiting for you?  Probably.  They probably just realized you were up here.  They're chewing gum on that mic like a horse.  And they were just going to have to walk home or find a cab. 
[03:11:30]  No, I'm leaving now.  So goodbye, everybody.  Have a nice weekend.  Well, this means I'm going to be the last one standing on the Opie and Anthony show.  No, it's not the show.  Now it's the after show.  Not yet.  I haven't sent it to commercial yet.  I'm signing off.  Well, you can sign off all you want.  But as soon as that door shuts, I've become the last man standing.  I did it, folks.  I did it.  Stay tuned.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[03:12:00]  This is after Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Brought to you by Trojan Bearski and Condoms, America's most trusted condom.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live on a Friday.  Mars, I can barely see you.  I thought you had left.  You're hiding behind those TVs.  What did you think of the show today, Mars?  We don't get to hear from you all that often.  That's all.  Excellent show. 
[03:12:30]  Excellent show.  You thought so?  Yeah.  Do you know this cat here actually thinks that you like him?  Who?  This one right here.  Matt the Internet.  He swears up and down that you really fucking like him.  Did you hear on the show today, I think, either Opie or Anthony or Jim,  one of the three of them specifically said,  do you like Matt?  And did you hear what my response was?  No, I did not.  Can you please refresh my memory on there?  No.  Fuck no was my answer.  Fuck no.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely not.  And I can't even talk to him much today because you don't understand. 
[03:13:00]  I got all kinds of people on Twitter yesterday saying,  why would you spend that much time on the after show talking about Matt the intern?  I come in here this morning.  The first thing that Ant says to me was,  I was so pissed off listening to Matt the intern on the after show yesterday  that I almost called in.  The only reason I didn't is because I would have said something that was like over the line.  Well, I apologize to the people and to Anthony for bringing this douchebag up. 
[03:13:30]  That's not fair.  Good for you, Mars.  Good for you.  Mars is my boy.  I do like him.  Yeah.  I don't have a problem with this.  Yeah, but that's because you don't work with him.  Exactly.  Do you work with him?  I have very little interaction with that cat.  So it's easy.  So what you like is you see everybody else get pissed off.  Oh, I love it, man.  And then you're like, I like that guy.  Everybody's all riled up.  He riles you guys up.  Yeah.  He does.  I mean, I know the psychology behind it because I like seeing everybody get riled up too.  He pisses people off. 
[03:14:00]  He really does.  Eric would like, if Eric could fight, probably fuck him up.  He would.  He probably would.  He would try.  I mean, I'll bet that Matt is the one guy who can get Eric to try to fight.  Like, I'll bet Matt could get Eric to swing at him.  I mean, I know it.  I mean, I think I could take him, but he's a pretty big boy.  You know who else likes me?  Turn it off.  Who?  T-Dog.  Travis?  He just called you T-Dog.  I've never heard that in my life.  Well, why would you?  It's not a creative, clever, fun nickname.  Well, I stole from Danny. 
[03:14:30]  Do you like Matt?  No, Danny doesn't even say that.  Yeah, he does.  No, he doesn't.  Sure he doesn't.  Shut up, Matt.  Travis, final word on the matter.  Do you like Matt?  I said I don't mind Matt that much.  But are you minding him more as this very conversation continues?  Yeah.  See, this is what you do, Matt.  You isolate, and you actually get any supporters that you have to run away quickly.  As long as Matt's not talking to me, I really don't mind the guy.  Yeah.  That's it.  And that's why Mars likes you, because he doesn't have to interact with you.  And Sam, I know you do like me. 
[03:15:00]  I know for the show, you know, it's like, yeah, fuck Matt, no, no, no, no, no.  But I know deep down there's an affection.  Yeah, that's right.  There really is.  A lot of times I just, you know, pretend things on the show.  It's all an act.  It's all right.  But you're good in here.  I mean, that's it.  No, not like you're good, like you're doing a good job.  Like, you're finished.  You can go.  Well, I wasn't doing a good job, though, too.  You're all done.  You're all wrapped up.  So, there's the door.  Wrapped up like a Trojan condom?  I already did the plug. 
[03:15:30]  I know.  So, don't let the door hit you where the good Lord Splitch is, they say.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't get it.  All right.  Tell your story walking, is what I'm saying.  You know what I mean?  Hit the road, Jack.  Keep on going.  What's going on here?  Oh, okay.  Come here for a second, Matt.  I see.  Come here, come here, come here, come here.  What I was trying to...  You've been bossed!  Okay, Rowan wanted to try his new game.  Travis, did you see Rowan's new game?  No, I did not.  He puts a box on people's heads.  That's the new Rowan game.  Matt, you're...  No, you're actually done now. 
[03:16:00]  Rowan wanted Matt, the intern, to come back in here.  Did Matt just rip your box?  Yes, he did.  Why would you do that?  Why would you stop the fun?  Tell your story, Walker.  I'm making a box to you.  Sorry, I don't have a box big enough for you.  I'm a fat ass.  Does that mean like a vagina?  Travis, did I miss something?  Yeah, I think Mars wants to have sex with Rowan.  Are you saying that you have a vagina, but it's small?  No, you could just put a box over my head.  I know, but you said, sorry, I don't have a...  Oh, you're saying that you're the...  You can't find a cardboard box that's big enough to cover... 
[03:16:30]  Oh, I got it.  Okay.  I didn't get it at first.  I still think it's the other way.  You think it's a vagina.  You know that in America, the kids use the slang box as for female genitals.  I've heard it.  Okay, I didn't know.  Yeah, Rowan, his new game that he discovered yesterday is to run up and down the hallway  and putting a cardboard box over people's heads while they're trying to work, and they  get pissed at him.  It's a little immature.  I thought so too.  I likened it yesterday to...  It's like...  Because we even had people up here, like publicists and stuff, and they were getting work done, 
[03:17:00]  and they were having meetings and everything.  And Rowan, it was out of Rowan's head that any of this was at all important, that he  had a mission, and it was to put a box on people's heads.  It was as if everybody was here at work, and there was one retarded kid who was running  around unclaimed, and nobody knew why he was there, but everybody just patted him on the  head and let him play his games.  And that was Rowan.  Yes.  Yes.  You're okay with that.  It's called creativity.  And then poor Steve Sterniolo, he was in here yesterday from Raw Dog. 
[03:17:30]  He's just trying to get a break in this business.  That's all he's trying to do.  He's just trying...  He knows one celebrity, okay?  Lisa Lampanelli.  She's on Raw Dog.  It's the only celebrity that Steve Sterniolo knows.  And he's trying to, you know, be the guy who knows her.  She was on his phone show yesterday, so she says goodbye to him.  And as they're talking, and Steve's going, hey, let me know next time you're around,  you want to do something with Raw Dog?  As the conversation's happening, you've been boxed! 
[03:18:00]  And he puts the cardboard box over the poor guy's head.  You know, I'm listening to this story in the back office, and the only thing I can think  of is that scene from, oh, fuck, what's that fucking...  League of Their Own, when they're all on the bus, and that fucking shitty fat kid is  just running up and down on the bus.  That's Rowan.  That's Rowan.  That's exactly Rowan.  And then there is one...  You're gonna lose!  You're gonna lose!  And then who puts him in his place?  Is it Tom Hanks?  Who makes him, like, feel bad about himself? 
[03:18:30]  There was one guy who works there.  Everybody's trying to get work done.  Like, people are on the phone, and the box is big enough to fit over the head and the  hand and the phone receiver.  So one guy is actually trying to get work done.  People are leaving.  These are publicists.  And they're like, hey, make sure you give me a call.  And as he turns around to talk to him, Rowan puts the box on his head.  The one thing that stopped this game was the ladies leave, and the guy turns around, and  he hands the box to Rowan, and he says, take your box and go.  If I see you walking around with this box again, I'm going to fucking murder you. 
[03:19:00]  And Rowan, I'm just cracking up in the office, because Rowan, I just see him nod with a sad  face and just walk away.  And that was it for the box game yesterday.  You really do need to entertain yourself around this place, though.  I mean, I can identify Rowan in the sense that you kind of need something to just make  yourself, to amuse yourself.  You go crazy.  Yeah, Rowan was, I guess, the dick in the ass thing yesterday, moving guests around and 
[03:19:30]  dealing with publicists.  Yeah, and then it started with Eric, though, because we got him first with the box.  And then, yeah, Rowan had to relieve himself of some tension, so he decided instead of going  to get Yankee Cranky, as was discussed yesterday, he was going to run around laughing and giggling,  and he started with E-Rock putting boxes on people's heads.  What, did you end up doing the Yankee Cranky afterwards?  No, no, I have to get Christmas gifts.  I have to just say, you're just like, ah, handjob or Christmas gifts, you're crossing  off names on your, well, he's not that important. 
[03:20:00]  I do have to.  I got a text message, hey, we got you a Christmas gift.  I'm like, fuck.  Yeah, I got to bust one out, but I got to get you a gift.  I don't know.  Yeah, I can't write down a Christmas card, like I busted one out, I owe you one.  Sorry, here's a gift card.  Well, I'm glad that you found some way to relieve your tension.  Do you ever worry, while you're doing stuff like that, that there's going to be somebody  walking down the hallway that says, what the fuck is this guy doing?  I didn't think about that. 
[03:20:30]  You were there yesterday, I didn't think about that at all.  If there's something that people need to know about Roland that people might not know  about Roland, it's that he doesn't give a fuck.  He does not give a fuck.  But it's not like a tough guy doesn't give a fuck thing, it's just like consequences  don't occur to him.  It's not like a put-on character, it's not like anything to get attention or to create  some kind of aura that isn't him.  It's just him.  It's completely real, and he does not give a fuck.  But when he gets in trouble, he gets shook up by it. 
[03:21:00]  But then eventually, he finds something to amuse himself and forgets about it.  And he moves on to the next thing, and instead of being all bummed out because he got in  trouble, he spends the rest of the day playing the box game.  And he doesn't care if he gets in more trouble, because it doesn't occur to him that it could  happen.  It's been well documented that Roland will fall asleep in meetings.  Right.  And you would think that's bad, but then he'll joke about it right there with his boss right  in front of his face.  He'll be like, oh, I hope I don't fall asleep at this meeting. 
[03:21:30]  Like, literally, the big boss, like, I'm talking, not like the big boss to us.  Like, we have three bosses.  They're tiered.  Our third boss will say, Roland, you going to join us for this meeting while he's sleeping?  And instead of Roland saying, yes, sir, I'm sorry, and getting all, like, shaken up, he'll  open his eyes.  He'll cross himself and say, I'm just praying for your soul.  And his, and his excuse is, his excuse is, because that way, if they think I'm doing  something religious, they can't bring it up to HR. 
[03:22:00]  It's Jesus.  I love Jesus.  He's asleep.  Just because I pray to Jesus, it doesn't make me a criminal.  It's like, it's like a, it's like T-bowing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Campos-ing.  That's what it is, though, Roland, right?  It's not that, like, you sit there looking at your bosses saying, I don't give a fuck.  Like, when your bosses throw down the gauntlet, you're like, oh, shit, I'm fucked.  And then eventually, you kind of just amuse yourself with something else, and you don't,  you don't, you don't.  Something pops in my head, and I go, all right, might as well do it.  Yeah.  Like, your focus is such that you have a one-track mind, and when it's playtime, it's playtime. 
[03:22:30]  You enjoyed it?  Roland, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.  Just watching you run around, you go out, up and down this hall, going out to the lobby,  you go upstairs, like, so many, so many people who are powerful at this company.  Had the opportunity to see you spending an hour of your time running around putting  cardboard boxes on people's heads.  Roland, you know what you need to do?  You need to go up to the 37th floor, you know, where you can see over by reception and 
[03:23:00]  get, like, a fishing rod with some line and put a box on it.  That way, you could just lower it onto people's heads from the 37th floor.  Danny just took the game to the next level.  It's the greatest, because who wouldn't want to do that?  It's like, we have a fun job, we work in radio, but then when we're off the air, it's  still corporate, okay?  So, like, I'm not talking about to the ditch diggers, I'm talking to the people who, like,  have to go to a corporate environment to work.  When the show ends, the only difference between this environment and the environment that 
[03:23:30]  I'm sure a lot of you guys out there work in is that we don't have to wear shirts and  ties, and you do.  Right.  But aside from that, it's the exact same place.  So, who that works in a corporate environment hasn't at one point thought to themselves,  you know what would be fun?  If I could just run around cubicle to cubicle throwing a box on people's heads as they try  to get work done and watching them get pissed off.  Like, the box is already, he used the same box for everyone, and it's already in pieces.  One, Steve Sterniolo, when he did the Lisa Lampage, he kicked Roland in his leg and ripped 
[03:24:00]  up the box.  And I said, hey, you've been boxed.  Yeah.  Actually, Steve Sterniolo, who I called the pit bull yesterday because he just goes after  people, texted me and saying, Roland is just acting out because he needs constant attention.  No, I don't think that's true at all.  I don't think that's true either.  I don't think Roland thinks to himself, what is, look at everybody, look at this, everybody,  because he'll just do it like, you'll just look out of the corner of your eye and realize  Roland's doing some dumb shit again. 
[03:24:30]  Like, he just, he just does it.  It's not the action that's defining the person, it's the person.  So, Roland doing this, I just see Roland trying to amuse himself.  It was somebody, like intern Matt, that's someone who's just trying to, you know, get attention.  He wants to make sure everybody sees him, whereas Roland's going to do it whether  you look or not.  Roland just wants to have a laugh before he has to go home.  Like, Roland, if you're outside his office having a conversation with someone in a cubicle  or something, he just starts winging garbage at you, whether it's cans or anything, he 
[03:25:00]  just finds whatever he finds on his desk and just starts throwing it.  Like, and this is how you know it's not for attention.  Because he shares an office, it's just him and the sex man.  It's Roland and E-Rock in that office.  And out of nowhere, you'll walk by the office and just hear Roland yell at E-Rock, shut the  fuck up!  And chuck a handful of pens at him or whatever's on his desk.  It could be something he needs.  It could be a whole bunch of talent documents.  He just takes the whole pile and throws them in E-Rock's face. 
[03:25:30]  And he doesn't know anybody's outside the door watching.  He just doesn't.  And then I guess, again.  You two are like brothers who just constantly, like, you just, you're in, your chair has wheels  on it, so of course you have to play with them and roll around the office.  And he just rolls his chair over to E-Rock and starts punching him in his shoulder.  And it's just, it's two little kids.  It really is like that movie Step Brothers.  It is.  Like, you guys, you're both over 30 years old.  Don't touch my drum kit.  Yeah. 
[03:26:00]  Or Liam Soda-bombed us once.  It was awesome.  Liam from Talent?  Yeah.  What do you mean Soda-bombed?  He got, like, a cup of soda and just threw it on the ground and it exploded.  This is a place of business.  I was laughing so, Eric got so mad, I couldn't stop laughing.  It was, like, the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.  You know, I just remember, do you remember Sammy back at CBS, back when we had that gig,  where Roland's gag over there was just to pour water on the floor for no reason whatsoever?  Yeah.  We'd be sitting in the K-Rock offices while the show was on, and Roland would just turn, 
[03:26:30]  and it was just one big office back then, and Roland would just turn, and he'd look  at us and say, hey, Sam, I gotta go.  And he'd take an entire bottle of Pullman Spring, and he'd put it next to his crotch,  and then he'd just pour the bottle out onto the carpeted floor.  Like, he wasn't just pouring, like, a little bit out for his home.  He's like, half a bottle of water was soaking into the, and, you know, a lot of the floors  at radio stations, you know, people should know this, like, they're not, it's not just  the floor.  Like, wires and shit is underneath the floor. 
[03:27:00]  Generally, the floors are raised, and they run wires under the floors.  So when you're pouring water, and Mars, this is true here too, right?  Absolutely, yes.  So when you're pouring half a bottle of water directly onto the floor in one spot, it's  gonna seep through the carpet and drip onto the wires, correct?  Absolutely.  I got Steve once, because Steve sat down.  Steve C?  Steve C, he goes, damn it, Roland, no more water!  Got a little jolt.  Imagine him with fucking liquid ass.  Were you around when we had liquid ass? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, but I didn't find it funny, though.  That was the worst.  It was stunk.  Dude, I did it to Eric for a long time.  I don't know if you ever figured that shit out.  Oh my god, I forgot you did that!  Okay, he did, because he blamed it on me.  Danny, I don't know if you know this.  Roland, you probably don't.  Travis, we had liquid ass.  I guess it was a sponsor at the time.  Yeah, I guess this needs a little bit of a setup.  Yeah, and it was just, it's like, they had, like, binaca sprays and eyedroppers full of  this stuff that literally, with two drops, it would fill the entire room of the most putrid, 
[03:28:00]  shit-smelling aroma you could imagine.  Yeah, I want people to know that this is not like you go to, like, your local, you know,  whatever store and get one of those little bomb bags where it smells like rotten eggs or whatever.  This is not one of those things.  This smelled legitimately like fucking horse shit.  It's worse, it's worse than stink bombs.  Like those little glass things that you let off at school.  Yes, it's so much worse than that.  And that's the thing, if you remember, for a while, the pit was to spray intern David with  and watch people's reactions. 
[03:28:30]  So at one point, we actually, like, I went down with him to Starbucks, and I sprayed it  all over his jacket, all over his shoes and his pants and everything.  Like, he just stunk like shit, and he walks into Starbucks, and he keeps asking people  for help, and the whole time, like, I'm watching him, and people are asking him if he stepped  in shit, or, like, they're trying to find out if there's something wrong in the bathroom,  and it's just, you know, waffling out into the air.  And it was just so funny, because I was outside the restaurant, or the restaurant, whatever, 
[03:29:00]  the Starbucks, and just to watch people, because you'd watch a guy talk to David, and then  David shake his head, and then David check his shoes, because I don't think I stepped  in it.  David told me that his mother got so pissed at him, because he went home, and he walked  into the house reeking of shit, and so she had to wash all his clothes, and then even  off the air, like, he'd go to the bathroom, and one of us would just spray his jacket with 
[03:29:30]  liquid ass, and he'd come back, and he'd go, no, no, you can't do this anymore.  My mom says I smell like shit, she gets really bad.  You can't do it anymore.  You can't do it.  That's a great impression.  Damn.  Damn, that's a good impression.  So we had this liquid ass, and I still have it somewhere.  I don't know if it expires or whatever, but it's in our offices here.  But, I mean, it was the type of stuff that we had to hide, because it was so pungent that  it wasn't just a prank.  It was like, all right, that's fighting words. 
[03:30:00]  Like, if you're going to spray me with liquid ass, you want a war here, because this doesn't  come off.  Mars went long form with this one.  Over the course of a winter, he would just take the eyedropper, and he'd squirt a little  bit on E-Rock's jacket.  And we're going to tell him this.  He's not back until Tuesday, because he's taking Monday off, too.  Chris Aigle is?  Yeah.  Chris Aigle.  He's taking a nice four days for himself, but he'll find out about this now that you're 
[03:30:30]  admitting it.  On the ass part of his jacket, Mars used to come in, and it wasn't every day.  It was like every three or four days, he'd squeeze a little more.  Until one day, I remember, Mars saw me looking around the office like, what the fuck?  And then Mars would be like, yo, yo, what are you doing?  And I go, it smells like shit in here.  I think somebody, either somebody sprayed the liquid ass, or something.  And Mars, yo, yo, you can't tell anybody this.  I go, okay.  And he goes, I've been spraying Eric's jacket for like a month. 
[03:31:00]  And I go, why?  And he goes, because fuck Eric.  I go, okay, I guess I understand the science behind that.  But Eric, I'll never forget, it was after that.  Like, nobody asked him to do it.  Nobody put him up to it.  And this is another thing like Roland.  It wasn't a cry for attention, because Mars didn't tell anybody he was doing it.  He just did it out of pure venom. 
[03:31:30]  And so, Eric, he comes to me like weeks after I found out about this, and I'm just laughing  every time Eric puts on his jacket after Mars tells me this.  Like, look at all shitty, walking out, freaking of crap.  Eric came to me, and he goes, do you smell something in here?  I go, no, I don't, Eric.  I don't know what that is.  And he smelled his jacket, and he smelled it.  He knew what it was.  And he goes, seriously, did you spray my jacket with liquid ass?  And I go, no. 
[03:32:00]  Was it somebody?  And I go, no.  And he goes, well, why does it smell like this?  He had no idea.  And I can't wait until he finds out, because he walked around for a month and a half, at  least, just reeking of shit, because he never washed the jacket, because, you know, who  washes their jacket?  There go my pictures with fighters.  That's it.  That's it.  I'm done.  Although, Eric's idea of pranking you back will be to take, like, a B celebrity and 
[03:32:30]  say, oh, Mars wants a picture with you.  And then you get a picture with, like, MC Hammer and be like, okay, that's the, gotcha.  Yeah, that's how he got Derek.  Yeah, that's right.  You know, it's a shame that a lot of the reasoning that bad things happen to Eric is just for  that exact reason.  There's really no reason.  It's just, well, fuck Eric!  Can I tell you something, though?  It's safe to come out on the air, because he doesn't work here anymore.  Steve C., I used to drive that motherfucker insane, and he didn't even know I was doing 
[03:33:00]  it.  With what?  With the BlackBerry.  Do you know what I used to do with the BlackBerry?  No.  I know what you're talking about.  You know, right, Travis?  Of course I do.  Okay.  And then I have something after that.  Well, if we're going to start him with Steve C. stories.  Steve C. was the producer, the old, you know, producer here.  I'm sure if you've been listening, you know who he is.  He's still on some of the production.  But yeah, you know who he is.  We used to drive him out of his mind crazy, and he didn't know it was us. 
[03:33:30]  We had two studios.  We were at K-Rock, and then we'd do the walk over to XM.  So he'd get to XM, and he'd be like, and he was so, he was very, he was an absent-minded  guy.  He was not, he had no focus.  Like, he was just like a mile a minute, like, boom, boom.  You had to get an answer from him right there, because it was just going to fly out of his  head.  Going, everything was going on at once for this guy.  Because he was worried about his website.  Because he's worried about his website one minute.  Steve, are you working everywhere?  No, no, we're going to put it on my website. 
[03:34:00]  I don't know what to do.  It's like, that's how he'd dig himself into so many holes.  So, like, little things would just, you'd throw a monkey wrench in, and it would just  fuck up his whole thing, because he'd be worried about this.  So he'd get to XM after doing the K-Rock.  What are you doing over there?  I don't know.  He's playing with tape.  What are you rolling?  He's playing with a thing of scotch tape.  Will you have to fix your box?  No.  No.  So, he'd get to XM, and he'd go, Steve would go, where's my BlackBerry? 
[03:34:30]  I don't know, Steve.  He'd go, oh, fuck.  Did I leave it at Steve?  I lost my BlackBerry.  And he'd, like, he'd lost it several times.  I fucking lost my BlackBerry again.  I don't know.  And he'd have to go back to the other studio, and then he'd find it.  What he didn't realize was, every, like, maybe once every couple months, so he didn't  catch on to, you know.  Because if I did it often, he'd know it was a prank.  But every couple months, I'd take his BlackBerry that was on his desk.  He'd go into the studio, and I'd chuck it under his desk. 
[03:35:00]  And then he, because I knew he'd forget about it until he needed it.  And he wouldn't need it until we were back at XM.  So then he'd go back to XM, and go, where's my BlackBerry?  And I'd go, I don't know.  And then he'd go under his desk and find it, and he'd think that he dropped it.  Every time.  Oh, it must have fallen off my desk.  Do you remember when he lost something out of his wallet?  Let me tell you this.  That's the story I was going to bring up.  Oh, by all means, I don't want to step on your desk.  No, no, no.  Go.  You do it.  You do it.  Well.  Oh, I'll say real quick.  Okay.  I'll do my little text messaging thing that we used to do. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, my God.  This is great.  This is another one with Steve C.  Steve used to text us early in the morning, or, you know, for nothing.  Just, I'm going to be late.  Okay, great.  That doesn't affect my prep at all.  Right.  So at one point, it was almost a daily basis that he was getting stuck in the Holland Tunnel.  So one day I just wrote back, error 404.  Like he texted you, I'm stuck in the Holland Tunnel.  Yeah, stuck in the Holland Tunnel.  And you texted back, error 404. 
[03:36:00]  Error 404.  Like when a webpage doesn't exist, you get a 404 error.  That's like the, yeah.  So he gets into work.  He's like, did you get my text?  I'm like, no.  He's like, oh, let me look at my phone.  He's like, oh, I sent it.  I was like, no, I didn't get it.  He's like, oh, look, error 404.  I'm like, I don't know.  And the website doesn't exist.  Never questioned it.  Never thought that that's ridiculous to get.  Yeah, that a text message.  The wallet story is great.  Because it's, he sent an intern out to go get him something. 
[03:36:30]  I don't know what it was.  It doesn't even matter, I don't think.  And the intern left Steve, went out, got him his stuff, came back.  And when he was handing Steve the stuff, he left Steve's credit card on some random desk at K-Rock that wasn't being used.  And so, I don't remember, was it you that found it, Danny?  I don't recall.  I just remember seeing it there, and it was just like, well, I mean, why would we just be nice and give this back to the man? 
[03:37:00]  Of course we need to fucking torture this guy somehow.  And so we, Danny and me both knew the card was on the desk.  And we knew it was Steve's card because it had his little business thing on it.  And so, that's when I informed Danny, if you chuck it under the desk, you'll never find it.  So, we took the card and threw it under the desk.  And then, next thing you know, we don't know, he hasn't asked anyone about it, but about an hour later, he's yelling at an intern for losing his credit card.  Then, a half an hour later, he's on the phone with American Express, canceling his cards and paying fees to order new ones. 
[03:37:30]  And after, and only after.  Right.  That the card, that we knew that the card was canceled and a new one had been ordered, guess what was found?  Because we were like, Danny, we can't let him, you know, we can't let him find out that we, so we put it back on the desk because it was a random desk.  And then me or Danny goes, Steve, is that your card on the desk? 
[03:38:00]  You know, I just want people to know that it's not like, it's not like we're just very mean-spirited.  No.  Everybody here is mean-spirited.  I'm not going to say that no one's mean-spirited.  But, sometimes, like, you know, stuff builds up over so much time, it's just so well-deserved.  We're just having fun, though.  It's just so-and-deserved, but it's just pranks.  Remember when we used to flip his computer screen upside down?  That was a good one.  I remember I used to rewire his computer, basically, and just, like, unplug shit and plug stuff in where it didn't blow up. 
[03:38:30]  Take a screen cap of his home screen and then set it as the desktop, and he couldn't figure that out.  I also used to pry the keys off his keyboard and then rearrange them to spell out nasty things.  Yeah, but he used to call me all the time, hey, Mars, I need a, I got to put a workout on it for my computer.  It's just not working.  Look what it's doing.  And I would see, like, look, man, they're fucking with you.  It was so easy to do.  But then we had to stop doing that because I think he had me and you in a room, or maybe it was just me. 
[03:39:00]  I don't know, because he thought it was me even though it was you.  And said, listen, if these keys on my computer are mixed up from now on, I said, Steve, it's not me.  Does it matter?  If these keys are mixed up on my computer, I'm sending you home.  I go, Steve, it's not me.  Does it matter?  If they're not where they're supposed to, if it's not QWERTY, you're getting sent home.  I remember when he said that.  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  He would get really fed up.  Well, I don't know who it was.  I think it was Danny, but he found a way to change his screensaver because you couldn't do it in IE, but you could do it in Mozilla.  And Danny would come and he would change his screensaver all the time to, like, Meatspin or fucking just gay guys.  Oh, you mean?  You or Derek?  Who would just put gay porn?  I think that was Derek.  Just put gay porn pictures on.  Derek did that until, you know, he did it.  It was also, it was a lot easier to get away with doing these horrible things when we were on an island, so to speak. 
[03:40:00]  It was on 57th Street, so we had the entire place to ourselves.  We just mentioned, like, four or five HR issues in one sentence, but when there is no HR department to report to upstairs, you can get away with a lot more.  And if anyone in HR is, like, listening or enjoying the show today, none of this actually happened.  We're just kidding.  We make up.  It's better of the mind.  I mean, that's half of this business.  We make up stories for the air all the time.  Right, Roland?  There's no box game. 
[03:40:30]  There's no box game.  Don't be silly.  Yeah.  You're too busy booking guests to play with boxes.  I'm sorry.  Hello?  Yes.  Nobody ever hid Eric's jacket in the drop ceiling during the David Letterman taping.  Oh, my God.  Before the David Letterman taping because he insisted he needed it to go to Letterman.  Okay, so this was when Opie and Anthony were doing Letterman.  And we all stayed late at the office that day to go see our bosses, our buddies, for their first time on the David Letterman show.  And, you know, I guess it's old Hollywood folklore that, you know, Letterman likes to keep his studio cold, like 65 degrees or something. 
[03:41:00]  But, like, all of us, it was summer.  We're like, well, we're going to walk there.  Who cares?  It's just AC.  We're fine.  But, like, Mr. Show Business Eric Nagle has to be the guy who knows.  So he doesn't show up to Letterman without a jacket on.  So we went out to, oh, my God, this was the same day as I got some lunch inside.  So I'll get to that in a minute.  I'll get to that in a minute. 
[03:41:30]  I wasn't even sure if I wanted to even bring that part up.  I'll get to that in a minute.  But what happened was while Eric was out, I think it was Than, because he was still with the show.  And he's got gigantism.  He's very tall.  And he could reach the ceiling.  And we had drop ceilings.  And he opened up one of the tiles.  And he shoved Eric's jacket for no reason.  Just because Mars.  Fuck Eric.  That would be the reason why.  Because fuck Eric.  That's right.  He shoved his jacket. 
[03:42:00]  And then we all left to the Ed Sullivan Theater to watch the David Letterman taping.  As we're walking there, Eric is screaming at Than on his cell phone,  Where the fuck is my jacket?  I don't know, bro.  I'm going to be late.  I need my jacket.  I can't go see the Letterman taping if I don't have my jacket.  And I haven't left the studio yet because you hid my jacket.  Where is it?  Don't know, dude.  Eventually we had to tell him because he insisted that he couldn't go.  But that was the same day that he was already pissed off. 
[03:42:30]  Because Steve invited us all out for pizza.  As a group.  Oh, yeah.  We went upstairs.  Right.  All the employees got to go and have a nice pizza lunch before Letterman.  And on our way out, Eric wasn't there when we discussed this.  He was wherever.  But on our way out, we noticed that Eric had already bought lunch for himself.  And he had left it at his workstation.  And it was a nice salad.  It was one of those in New York. 
[03:43:00]  They have a whole bunch of restaurants where you can make your own salad.  And you put it into a plastic bowl.  And you mix everything up.  And blah, blah, blah.  So that bowl is sitting on Eric's desk.  And Eric is nowhere to be found.  Probably dropping a deuce, knowing Eric, the way we know Eric.  And so Travis, being the whimsical, good-natured river that he is, thinks it would be funny to put the bowl, which has a cover, in the garbage can.  And I gently placed it in that garbage can. 
[03:43:30]  And so Travis places the salad on top of the garbage, in the garbage can, with the lid sealed, on top of everything, with the idea of being, we'll all have a good laugh.  Then Eric will take his salad out and eat it.  Now, most people would probably just leave it at that.  Right?  Because that's a pretty big statement on its own.  Right.  Like, hey, hey, fuck you.  I'm going to put your shit in the garbage.  Like, that's insulting in the first place.  But Than, who the last time we talked to him was on the after show, when he came back in with Laszlo a few months ago. 
[03:44:00]  He specifically said that, to this day, Eric is his least favorite person who works for the show.  He still has venom towards Eric.  And Than was always the one, I think, who took the salary difference the hardest.  The rest of us kind of were like, okay, I got over it.  And Than always, and the lottery thing was Than's thing.  When Eric won the lottery with the Daily Newspaper, these are all old bits.  But Eric's good fortune got under Than's skin in a big way. 
[03:44:30]  Which, it was what it was.  Than sees the salad in the garbage that Travis has put there.  And he walks over with his size 14 shoe.  And he stomps like three times as hard as he can.  Crushing the salad.  Emptying the bowl.  Getting dressing all over his sneaker.  Into the trash can, where it's completely inedible.  Even if you wanted to eat garbage salad, you still couldn't eat garbage shoe smush salad. 
[03:45:00]  And we go, oh my god, I can't believe you did that.  Let's get the fuck out of here before he realizes this.  So we're all scurrying out.  And Eric, as we're leaving the office, is coming in the office.  We're like, oh fuck.  And we go, okay, we feel bad.  So somebody says, Eric, we're all going down for pizza.  Do you want to join us?  And Eric said the one sentence that haunted him for years after this.  And we should bring this back to the table so it haunts him again.  And he said, no thanks. 
[03:45:30]  I got a salad inside.  Now, you talk about Than's fucking venom for Eric.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And let's not forget that it was Than's doing.  Than was the guy that wanted to get Eric the Christmas present all those years ago that he did.  Which, as some of us recall, was a t-shirt with the words printed, I bring nothing to the table.  And it was that day when Eric read the t-shirt.  That's the infamous drop.  I bring nothing to the table got brought up. 
[03:46:00]  So, yeah, Eric's taking his lumps.  Eric has certainly taken his lumps.  And let's just say he went hungry for lunch that day.  And he did make it to Letterman on time, but after the rest of us.  Sam, what an ass you are.  What do you mean what an ass I am?  I would never do that to him.  I just said, were you listening?  It was Travis and Than.  And by the way, Roland, Eric's best friend here.  Yeah.  This was a month ago.  We went down to Wendy's, and Eric wasn't here.  I'm telling you.  You wanted to go?  I'm telling you. 
[03:46:30]  No, now I want to know.  Okay.  You want to hear what Eric's best friend in the world is?  We're talking sugar.  It was sugar salt.  Best friend or best man?  No, just best friend.  Just best friend.  Wait, why not best man?  Oh, Roland wanted to see Harry Potter.  It was the opening night.  I had my wand.  This one, okay, if we're isolating people because we're telling old stories, why don't we bring  you up to present day to a month ago.  I had too much sugar.  I had too much sugar.  You know that.  Roland and me went down to Wendy's for lunch. 
[03:47:00]  And Roland likes to get the large, the super size, whatever the big one is, that's for  Roland because sometimes he has a stressful day.  He needs a little treat.  And so Roland decided to get himself an enormous barrel of Mr. Pibb, which is a sugary soda.  It's like Dr. Pepper Mars.  Okay.  And a large Frosty on the side with his meal.  So he's sitting there drinking sugary soda and chugging this Frosty and he's just all sugared  up for no reason.  And Eric's not, it wasn't in that Friday as he's not in this Friday. 
[03:47:30]  And Roland, we're going, we're going to Wendy's today for no reason.  And Roland takes his ketchup that he's poured into one of those cups.  It's not a packet.  And he just goes, fuck him.  And he takes it and he pitches it behind himself and smashes it into Eric's file cabinet.  Then he starts opening ketchup packets and just opening them and chucking them at all  of Eric's stuff. 
[03:48:00]  And then eventually, and then he starts, he pours it.  And Eric had a picture printed out of like Opie and Ron and Louis CK and Ricky Gervais  and everybody.  And then Roland goes, what the fuck does he need this for?  And he starts, he pours ketchup all over the picture.  So Roland goes, Roland goes, okay, okay, I'm going to get in trouble for this.  And he wipes all the ketchup off and he throws the picture in the garbage. 
[03:48:30]  He wipes everything off.  And then I go, oh, Roland, so you're, it's good.  You're taking it easy on him.  He'll never know.  And then Roland goes, yeah, but fuck him.  And he takes his fries after he's cleaned everything.  And he starts smearing fry grease.  He takes French fries and starts smearing fry grease all over his monitor, all over his phone.  And then, and then, and then, and then, Roland thought he was going to smear fry grease into 
[03:49:00]  the keyboard.  But since Roland is a very strong guy, he was pushing a little too far.  And Eric ended up with mashed potatoes in between his keys because the fry got smushed.  And on his phone?  And on his phone and everything.  And then Roland goes, shh, don't say anything, don't say anything.  And I go, okay, whatever, dude, you've lost your mind.  But, okay, so Eric comes back on Monday.  I came late that, and he goes, who was in this office after we left? 
[03:49:30]  I go, I don't know.  I don't know.  Whatever.  I don't know.  I find out later in the day, he emailed the Ron and Fez staff.  No, he told me.  And he emailed Bruce.  And he emailed Travis.  He told me, and he's like, can you, oh, Roland got boxed.  He emailed Travis.  He emailed the Ron and Fez guys.  And he goes, da, da, da, da, da.  There was somebody in this office, you know, I think, was it the Ron and Fez guys?  I'm going to have to contact security.  He's about to contact security. 
[03:50:00]  Until Roland goes, are you contacting security?  And Eric goes, yeah.  I'm going to find out who made a mess in my office.  They're just going to pull up the cameras.  Yeah.  It's a stupid Roland.  And Roland goes, Roland goes, Roland goes, ah, shut the fuck up.  I did it.  I was just kidding.  It's a joke.  It's a kid.  And Eric goes, what?  And Roland goes, that was kidding.  It was a joke.  I did.  And then for whatever reason, Eric goes, okay.  And that's it.  Now, I'm pretty sure that like, you know, me and Eric don't have any problems. 
[03:50:30]  And the problems that we did have in the past were all pretty minor.  But we still don't have that, like, friendship that maybe Roland and Eric share or maybe even  Stam and Eric share.  And I haven't done anything remotely close to the vile fucking despicable things that you  guys have done to that boy.  Aren't you almost glad you're not friends with Roland?  Yes.  Yeah, you can't get, you can't get close with Roland because either he will prank you or 
[03:51:00]  you'll do something that you didn't even realize that pisses him off and he'll just  be vindictive and motherfuck you at every turn.  Correct, Roland?  No.  Correct, Roland?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But yeah, I mean, I don't know.  I think it's for me and Eric, it's all good natured ribbing.  Yeah, but there's never any ribbing back.  That's like the, like, I, listen, I'm all for, I was in here with Troy a couple weeks  ago.  I was taking shots at him left and right and he gave it back to me. 
[03:51:30]  I'm all ready for people to give it back to me.  Well, and not, not just to you, but to anybody.  Like if, if I was Eric and I was taking the amount of shit that, that Eric takes and the  best comeback that you have is to like, oh, I'm going to make you take a picture with  someone that you don't want a picture with.  Like that's not on the same level of comeback.  Like he really needs to step some game up.  And I, I, for one, I'm in the Eric corner on this front where I would like to see Eric  take some of the shenanigans that get doled out on him.  I want to see him take those shenanigans to another level to the people that are doling  it out.  You got it.  I'd love to see it.  Remember what he did with Than and the Lost DVD? 
[03:52:00]  Oh yeah, that was, that really pissed off.  That was, that really pissed off.  Eric's, Eric's, uh, greatest prank, but even in the grand scheme of things, but it still  pissed him off a lot.  It wasn't amazing.  Yeah.  It still wasn't that great.  It pissed, it pissed off Than.  Than, who used to work here, was a giant Lost fan.  And he had his Lost DVD box set signed by like four or five members of the cast.  And then the guy who played John Locke was in studio.  And Eric was like, he went around, and I guess Travis is a big Lost fan.  He went around grabbing the people's box sets who wanted to get him signed and said, I'll 
[03:52:30]  take care of this.  Everybody said, okay.  And, uh, Than's box set, everybody said to Than from whoever, to Than from whoever.  So, Eric's handing him the box sets.  He goes, this one, could you make this out to me?  It's Eric.  He goes, okay, Eric with a K.  Could you make this one out to Travis?  Okay.  Could you make this one out to Nate?  And John Locke wrote, to Nate.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And Than goes, what the fuck, dude? 
[03:53:00]  He hates that.  He doesn't, he hates it.  Which is the actor, I got an autograph that says to sexy man, and they signed it?  Uh, Nick Swartzen, you got Nick Swartzen to sign a poster to the sex man.  What did Roland do to me?  Who, uh, who's the guy that's in Eastbound and Down?  Danny, uh.  Danny McBride.  Danny McBride.  Oh, yeah.  He had Danny McBride sign my picture with him, uh, to Travis the bearded woman.  Oh, I remember that.  Because he told him that that's what you guys call me on the show. 
[03:53:30]  I only assume there's going to be a Dr. Gay signing at some point.  Oh, yeah, Dr. Gay.  Right.  I was in there with Roland, and Roland was like, yeah, it's for Travis, but we call him  the bearded woman.  And then Danny McBride goes, you call him what?  And Roland goes, the bearded woman.  And Danny McBride goes, so should I make it out to the bearded woman?  And Roland goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Roland got, uh, Roland was photobombing some, uh, some pics yesterday, uh, that came out of  the Travis camp I had seen.  Uh, uh, Michael, uh, Hall was in.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:54:00]  Let me tell you.  I was trying to get out of the way.  I'm sorry.  Mr. Coke Logic cleared that right up.  And he's good for a Photoshop.  Yeah, Roland's, uh, as large as Roland is, he's incredibly easy to remove from photos.  Well, that's because he's, uh, he's, uh, he's very round.  So it's like an easy shape to just kind of.  You wear a solid color t-shirt.  It's easy to get a big, large section out.  It's very easy.  Well, let me tell you about this Argentium stuff.  Roland.  What a segue.  Holy shit.  Danny, Mars, Travis.  I don't know if you know about this.  Why does he use the bed?  I'll never understand why Steven Singer wants to do this. 
[03:54:30]  But, I can understand why the rest of you want to get some Argentium.  It's the king of all silver metals.  And it starts at only $149.  It's more pure than sterling silver.  It's brighter than platinum, white gold, and sterling.  It's low maintenance because it's tarnish resistant.  And Argentium is responsible and ethical because it's produced using only recycled silver.  It's a beautiful thing.  Uh, check it out now online at IHateStevenSinger.com or call him up. 
[03:55:00]  He'll tell you all about it.  It's 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.  Uh, you can even visit him in person at the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.  And if you do, I want you to ask for a few things.  Go to Steven Singer's store.  It's a great store.  They give you drinks.  They give you cookies.  And they're free.  They, what they try to do, they've even got some booze.  They try to liquor you up a little bit to buy some jewelry.  But, you don't need to be liquored up with the prices.  You'll get drunk off the discounts.  And that's a guarantee from Sam Roberts.  Go to the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
[03:55:30]  Ask for Turbo Joe.  Let Turbo Joe and Steven Singer know that you heard about this on After Open Anthony Live.  And suggest to them that they drop the whole Superman bed thing.  Because it just doesn't make any sense.  I don't understand why he does it.  And I want you to make that point clear to Steven Singer, too.  Uh, I hate StevenSinger.com for all your jewelry needs.  Um, I know everybody's a fan of Bobo.  There's a new idiot in town. 
[03:56:00]  And he's been on hold for the last three hours and five minutes.  Are you kidding?  Uh, is it really?  Jordan.  Yeah, it's me.  You're still on, you've been on hold for a while.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's okay.  I've been enjoying the show.  That's not Jordan.  What's the voice?  Uh, the voice?  Uh, it's just me on helium.  Uh-huh.  Jordan, I think it's Jordan doing a character.  Oh, yeah.  It's me.  It's me doing a character, you know.  Uh-huh.  Well.  Oh, yeah, it's me. 
[03:56:30]  Good one, Jordan.  You are good at the impressions.  So what, yeah, I see on the...  I'm not good at impressions yet, but you suck at wrestling, the views.  You just said I was, you, Twitter, whatever.  Um, you, I can't, I can't deal.  Jordan, I'm afraid of Jordan.  I'm gonna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna get in on this at, on any level.  I don't wanna...  Jordan, that's Danny talking.  On the, on the, on the, let's, let's, let's string this along or anything.  Hi, Jordan.  Um, because I think that Jordan is a very, very scary individual.  And I wouldn't put it past a Jordan kind of mind to come at somebody with a knife. 
[03:57:00]  So I'm just gonna politely stay out of this one, I think.  Jordan's capable.  Yes, I absolutely believe that Jordan is very capable.  Jordan, Jordan's the kind of guy, uh, that, which probably, like, have you guys ever seen  Talk Radio, that movie with Eric Boghossian?  Well, if you've seen the end of that movie, I won't ruin it out there for the people who  maybe haven't seen it, but watch that movie.  It's actually quite good.  Uh, the, the end of that movie reminds me of, of this Jordan person.  Jordan, are you capable?  Uh, I'm capable, but only if you push me to the fucking edge, that's all. 
[03:57:30]  How far have you been pushed?  Uh, uh, let me see.  I don't think I've been pushed, uh, that far.  Okay, good.  Uh, right, since I was 13.  How far has Sam Roberts pushed you?  Uh, not very far, because I actually am a big fan of you, Sam.  Good, I'm a big fan of you too, Jordan, and never forget that, because Danny's right.  Yeah, me too, I'm going to say that as well.  I'm a big fan of the Jordan.  Although, Jordan, except for Matt, the intern hits you.  Yeah, me and Adam Walsh are big fans of you.  Don't bring that up again, Jordan, it's tough for me to. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, come on.  Um, what did you, Jordan, you called in the show today.  Yeah.  Uh, you, some of your patented one-liners, couple of your, uh, your, your, your wonderful  karaoke voice a little bit.  Uh, Jim's been on your side from day one laughing at your jokes.  I usually laugh at your jokes.  Opie laughs at a lot of your jokes.  What happened today?  Anthony seemed to just flip the fuck out on you, uh, curse at you, yell at you, scream  at you.  Uh, why did Ant turn on you today?  Well, I believe that, uh, Anthony, uh, definitely has some sexual frustration, and I don't think 
[03:58:30]  his wife has given it to him in the last, like, week.  Probably not.  So it's just all bottling up.  You mean his ex-wife?  Because I would assume that she hasn't given it to him in, in, uh, I mean, over a decade.  Oh, I mean, he's still married.  No, Ant's not been married for some time.  Oh, is that, is that the truth?  That is.  Oh, wow.  Then, uh, I hope he doesn't, uh, fucking molest me in his bomb shelter.  Okay, that's a good call, actually, because he does have a bomb shelter, and he's known  to molest people.  Yeah, I've seen his, I've seen his karaoke, uh, things, and he, and he, and he looks like  you know he's singing when he's drunk, so. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  What, why do you think, though, that today of all days, uh, you, he flipped out on you  like that?  Because, uh, he's probably getting sick and tired of, uh, seeing me on hold.  You think so?  I don't know.  Well, we'll see what happens tomorrow at FH Riley's, because it's gonna be quite a, quite  a show.  Well, Ant hasn't pushed you that far.  No, no, no, no.  You're a fan.  I know he's just, I know he's just being, uh.  He's just busting balls.  Oh, yeah, he's busting balls.  He's a good guy.  You know, I know, I know people that know him, and, and he's just, uh, he just plays the  YZF on radio. 
[03:59:30]  Now, uh.  Who do you know that knows him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm not gonna throw out any names, because I don't wanna, uh, name drop, uh, but if, uh.  Well, why don't you do it?  Why don't you name drop?  Let's, let's have some fun.  Okay, there is, uh, somebody I went to karaoke with, um, this guy, Bobby D, he's like an older  guy, and he's actually, uh, related to Anthony, I believe.  That's probably a lie.  Um, Jordan.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  See how scary this is?  This is fucking scary.  It's cause you, cause you, does it creep you out when people are just, like, like, unapologetic,  like, I'm going, like, I just make things up all the time. 
[04:00:00]  Like, I like Bobo, but, because I know that Bobo is so harmless, and like, it's like, you  know, uh, and, like, you just know, like, you don't get any vibes off of Bobo, like, you  just, you see Bobo, you know exactly where you are, and you know exactly where he is,  and you know where you are with him.  He doesn't know exactly where he is, but you do.  Yeah, exactly, so, but, but I get a completely different vibe from, from Jordan, where I feel  that, uh, you, you can't, you could joke, and he might think it's funny at the time, but  he's the kind of guy that'll, that'll try to find out your address and wait for you  somewhere, so.  And, and, and liars, like, like, people who. 
[04:00:30]  I'm not the only one that got mugged, you know?  People who lie all the time, like, chronic liars, are also very unpredictable.  Because it's like, they tell you everything's fine until, like you said, Danny, they're waiting  for you, and you don't know.  Don't they make for good radio?  Like, most of the guys on your show are compulsive liars.  No, just you.  Um.  Sure.  I'm, I'm busting balls, Jordan.  Danny just told the big lie.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just busting balls.  Um, what, what compels you, uh, to sit on hold for three, four hours at a time?  I'll, I'll do anything to get onto the show, that's all. 
[04:01:00]  I like that.  And, and, and when you're on, you're, you're grateful?  Well, I'm very grateful because it's, it's one of the, uh, the best shows.  I, I, I'm sorry I didn't listen for so many years, but I was, uh, going through a lot  of addiction problems and all that, and, uh, and I'm back, you know, my, my brain's  still a little bit fucked up.  I'm, I go off the handle a little bit, but.  Sure.  I'm, I'm just a good guy, and I, and I like to entertain, and I like to do what I gotta  do, you know?  I, I, I shoot from the hip, I talk, I tell it like it is, and I don't take shit from  nobody.  That's your thing, you know what I mean?  It's like, if you want the real skinny. 
[04:01:30]  Does anybody agree with me that, that, uh, Jordan sounds a hell of a lot like Ass Brother Joe?  Talk, Jordan.  Say, uh, I'm in a YouTube cover band.  I'm in a YouTube cover band.  Yeah, I hear.  It's, it's sort of there, because, like, if you just kind of, if you just flip the channel  on, you, you could, you'd absolutely think it was Brother Joe.  Yeah, this is not Brother Joe, this is, uh, Crazy Lying Jordan.  He's got, it's the bass in his voice.  I'm a baritone.  Are you?  Yeah, well, I can sing opera, and I, and I might, uh, break it out tomorrow, so I'm gonna  shock everybody. 
[04:02:00]  Well, I guess there is a party going on at FH Riley's tomorrow.  It's there in Long Island.  Uh, on the other corner of Aeth and Walnut, is that right?  No.  It's on New York Avenue in Huntington.  In the heart of Huntington Village.  Huntington Village.  Oh, excuse me, I forgot there.  Oh, I know where I'm not gonna be.  Because he'll be there.  Well, thank you for, for calling in, and tell me this, Jordan.  You were on hold for three hours.  Was this exchange that we had, was it worth it?  Oh, yes, it was worth it, because I had to talk with great guys, and I know Danny, and  I know his friend, Michelle, and, uh, and. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy, Danny.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know a lot of people.  That's the way, that's where the fear comes in for you.  Well, I have a, I have a relative who got in touch with me, and we're not close, you  know, we probably haven't seen each other or spoken in easily eight years, I guess.  And she found me on Facebook to let me know that, uh, you know, she knows this character  who comes on the show a whole lot.  And, uh, yeah, he's a, you know.  I'm a regular.  Yeah, he's a regular on the show.  You've already told it.  You know, and so she gets to me, and I, you know, I, I just kind of gave my opinion of  the situation, and, uh, my, and my warnings. 
[04:03:00]  And, uh, you know, if she turns up missing in a fucking, in a ditch somewhere, I'm not  going to be surprised.  Do you know anybody that I know, Jordan?  Loved ones or anything?  Uh, not, not yet, uh, but, uh, I hope to, uh, try out your mom's cookies soon.  Yeah, you won't.  I mean, I keep my social circles small for a reason, because I don't need it, Jordan.  You know what I'm saying?  I just don't need the stress.  That's okay, man.  You just have to relax, okay?  Oh, shit.  Is that like a, is that a southern guy?  Is that Cleveland at your house, buddy?  Yeah, that is Cleveland Brown.  Mmm, that is just nasty, Sam. 
[04:03:30]  Those fucking cookies suck.  Must be a different Cleveland Brown.  I've just seen the show.  Must be a different one.  All right, thank you, Jordan.  Thank you, guys.  Have a great weekend.  Hey, Jordan.  He's gone.  I'm sorry.  I should have let you got him.  Um, how much time do we have left, Travis?  Not much, right?  No, you're done.  No, I'm not.  I'll tell you when I'm done.  No, you're done.  Uh, well, this has been After Open Anthony Live, brought to you by Trojan, Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan.  Nice day.  America's number one most trusted condom brand.  And I'll tell you this, sales department, you better give me some other shit to say real 
[04:04:00]  soon, because that's the last Trojan plug.  You know what you could say?  What?  You could say, uh, Danny J. Ross on Twitter.  Why would I say that?  Well, if you want, because you just said you want something to say.  Hey, I'm giving you an idea.  Every day at the end of the show?  Yeah, why not?  It's a little weird.  Besides, that's too complicated.  People will remember something like, not Sam.  That's where you'll go.  You know what I mean?  But they'll be confused, and they're not going to show up to hitting the right one, because  you're Sam, but it's not Sam, so is it really the right Twitter account I'm looking  for?  Wendy's.com.  Wendy's.com is the website to go to.  Oh, and everybody, please, uh, let's not forget, fuck Eric. 
[04:04:30]  Fuck Eric.  That's why.  I wish we could have talked about our new friendship with Donald Trump.  Maybe we'll get to it on Monday, when, after Opie and Anthony Live continues.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Peace.  Opie and Anthony's show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony Live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.
