<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a recounting of Jimmy's comedy special taping in Somerville, Massachusetts.  Opie, Anthony, and Chippa detailed both the successful aspects (great crowd, venue) and the numerous setbacks (technical difficulties, uncooperative staff).  Humorous anecdotes about near-stage mishaps and a producer's quick thinking were shared, alongside a poignant reflection by Opie on Patrice O'Neal's mother attending the show. The conversation then segued into a comparison of Somerville and Boston, followed by discussions of their Easter celebrations and the stressful traffic on their return trip.  A significant portion of the show was devoted to a scathing critique of Amtrak's food service, with detailed descriptions of inedible meals and complaints about misleading menu descriptions. Angelo even called in to explain the powdered egg-making process.  Further discussion included stories about bad sushi, a gym-goer unexpectedly becoming part of Jimmy's act, and the difficulties Jimmy faced getting his opening approved by the network. The segment concluded with a lengthy, and often vulgar, discussion surrounding the name change of a Philadelphia cheesesteak shop ("Chinks") and the evolving landscape of political correctness; Frank also called in to share his negative Amtrak food experiences. The segment ended with a discussion of Sunday Gravy pasta sauce and a humorous conversation about Opie's upcoming date.

The show continued with Opie sharing a bizarre dream about a falling recliner with Colin.  This transitioned into a caller, Steve from Philly, discussing the controversy surrounding someone nicknamed "Chink" due to their eye shape, including threats and vandalism following the name change. The hosts then engaged in several April Fool's pranks, including discarding Anthony's food and fabricating events like a morgue worker incident and Mayor Menino's car accident.  The show featured graphic descriptions and audio/video (or attempts thereof) of gruesome sports injuries, including Kevin Ware's leg break, comparing it to those of Lawrence Taylor, Sid Justice, Clint Malarchuk, and a hockey player hit by a puck. A caller shared a similar jet ski accident injury.  Discussion shifted to a female basketball player perceived as masculine, followed by a promotion of fictional "Tippi Tom Books on Tape" read by a homeless person.  Another caller discussed the Robin Ventura injury.  The show also covered a viral video, "Chip Ruins the Mood," which had over half a million views on Reddit, along with Amtrak's food service losses, Tony Romo's contract, and government incompetence.  Offensive language and jokes were frequent throughout this segment.

The next segment opened with a discussion of Amtrak's $85 million annual food service losses, transitioning to Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's farewell press conference. Opie recounted his Boston experience, including a stay at the Charles Hotel and his reaction to Menino's emotional, cane-aided speech.  The hosts played a clip of the speech, mocking Menino's mumbling and phrasing, using terms like "babbling buffoon" and "humorless idiot".  They then discussed past April Fool's Day pranks, including their own false report of Menino's death, and other pranks from various news organizations.  They also discussed a women’s college basketball player’s masculine appearance, speculating about potential testosterone use. The segment concluded with a discussion of Joe DeRosa's upcoming comedy tour and his recent breakup, delving into the details of the split, focusing on communication issues and an age difference. A minor argument about dishwashing after a dinner date was discussed at length, with varying levels of mockery from the hosts.  A digression on a face transplant recipient marrying a burn victim, and speculation on the recipient’s facial features, also occurred.

The show then featured comedian Joe DeRosa as a guest, discussing his recent breakup.  He detailed several arguments, including one about dirty dishes and another regarding his girlfriend giving his leftover barbecue to a homeless person. He expressed confusion over his lack of strong emotional response to the breakup.  The hosts and DeRosa engaged in sexually explicit and offensive humor, with numerous vulgar terms and crude jokes.  A picture of DeRosa's ex-girlfriend was shown, prompting more jokes.  The conversation touched on DeRosa's adoption and its impact on intimacy and trust.  Ronnie, a caller, offered a different perspective on the effects of adoption.  DeRosa promoted his upcoming tour and album recording.

A later segment featured Joe DeRosa again, focusing on his sadness and confusion about the breakup, revealing insecurities and self-criticism. The discussion covered relationship complexities, giving and taking, cohabitation challenges, and healthy relationship habits, all with humorous, often crude and sexually explicit, banter.  Sports reporter Michelle Beadle then joined, discussing her career, her large Twitter following, and her passion for professional wrestling.  She addressed the challenges of being a woman in sports reporting and a wrestling fan, mentioning CM Punk, The Rock, and the Undertaker, and the upcoming WrestleMania.  They discussed wrestling, with frequent jokes and off-color humor, Nicole Biggins also being briefly mentioned. Sam Roberts mentioned Michael Cole as the next day's guest.

The final segment focused heavily on professional wrestling, specifically WrestleMania and CM Punk, with Michelle Beadle discussing her show and opinions on the event. A running joke involved one host drinking wine while the other, a straight-edge individual, watched.  A humorous anecdote involved CM Punk allegedly winking at one of the hosts.  Beadle expressed her dislike for Vicky Guerrero and made predictions for the Triple H vs. Brock Lesnar match.  The hosts jokingly compared Beadle's status on her show to Beyoncé in Destiny's Child.  The segment concluded with promotional information for Beadle's show and social media handles, followed by the show's sign-off.

A spring cold.  Nah.  My eyes are itchy.  I'm just allergic.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to blow my fucking nose.  I pulled into New York five hours ago. 
[00:04:30]  After my whirlwind East Coast tour.  A lot of driving, huh?  No, not really.  Thursday, we all took off for Boston.  A lot of us, anyway, or a few of us, whatever, for Jimmy's terrific Somerville show.  Jimmy taped a special, and it fucking came out amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy's got a really good special.  It's exactly what I wanted from Boston.  Yeah.  The fucking theater was a nice size, but the fucking crowd was electric. 
[00:05:00]  It was fucking great, man.  Yeah.  It's one of the best sets I've ever had.  And the theater itself is terrific for a special.  Tremendous.  It was like 900 people, but they're close to you because the upper balcony went back far.  The lower didn't.  So it was like two stacks of people right in front of you.  Oh, it was fucking amazing.  Yeah.  No dressing room yelling?  After the second show, nothing like last year.  I thought we were going to have a perfect situation with Jimmy, but something might have got messed 
[00:05:30]  up in the second show.  A couple of them.  That it completely covered, so you're not even going to know in the end, but I get it.  Because it's the same shit that we go through around here.  You work around people that don't give as much of a fuck as you do.  Right.  So they don't care enough to really pay attention and do their jobs properly.  It was frustrating.  The first show was, usually the first show was good and the second show was great.  But I loved my first show so much that I had no pressure going into the late show. 
[00:06:00]  So the late show was even better.  I think just as an observer, I was a weekend observer, that second show was absolutely better.  And the first show was really good.  You'd be happy with the first show.  I was happy with the first show.  Second show, you were in a fucking zone.  It was effortless.  Yeah, and I got a lot of material.  I did like 90 minutes, so I got what I needed.  And there was a couple of cues that got missed, but it won't affect the special at all. 
[00:06:30]  And the thing that was distracting me, people coming in and out during, like, I could see it from the stage, the door kept opening.  Because, you know, they're drinking, they're pissing, but you won't see any of that in the special.  Oh, no, they'll edit that right the fuck out.  Was there any of this?  And I'm seeing the fucking door opening and closing.  Was that it?  No, no, no.  I did stop.  Jimmy was actually really cool.  Oh, okay.  The only memory I have is of the last one.  I know, and that's probably why.  It still scares me.  That's probably why you didn't go to Boston.  It reminds you of your father too much. 
[00:07:00]  My dad, I thought Jimmy was going to throw spaghetti against the wall.  Me and Aunt, we're so excited to be in Cleveland with Jimmy for the last special, which is almost a year ago.  We kind of had our own little, like, green room-ish area right next to Jimmy's.  And Jimmy was yelling and screaming and throwing shit.  And me and Aunt look at each other like, well, one of us got to go in there.  Heck, yeah.  I lost.  I went.  Nothing like that.  Nothing like that.  But I addressed it from the stage. 
[00:07:30]  I'm like, could you guys stop?  I'm like, it wasn't even that mad.  I was annoyed, but I knew you'd only see it in the reverse shot.  You're not going to see it, like, on the shot on me.  Yeah.  And there was a technical glitch in the first show, which I played with, and it was fine, and it worked out.  So it was really, I love this woman who's the producer.  Which is great.  Nothing comes off 100% without any glitch.  It's an impossibility.  And the cues that needed to be hit, the critical, critical cues, went off absolutely perfectly.  Yeah.  Perfect.  I could not have asked for better. 
[00:08:00]  Well, she was great.  No one was working at the theater, you know that.  There was no one really working there.  Right.  I mean, the production company certainly took over the entire theater.  You had Kenny.  And I think that was pretty much it.  And I think you had, like, college kids that were hired for the day to try to keep the people in their seats and stuff.  Right.  And then I went into the lobby at one point to grab a beer, and they shut down the beer taps early in the second show. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I was bummed.  I was looking for a wobbly pop.  A little brewski.  A little brewski.  The officer needed a brewski.  So, you know, the kids, I mean, they were just college kids.  They weren't going to, I don't know, they didn't know what the fuck they were doing, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  But the place itself was amazing.  It was very well done.  And I saw a little bit of, I'll get them today and watch both shows.  But what I've seen in the truck in between, I was very happy with the audio.  And I loved, the smoke was not an issue at all. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, man.  And I loved how it looked.  Stage design was great.  Yeah, no, it looks amazing.  And the color fonts you chose are perfect.  Yeah, I liked it too, man.  The cues, I guess they would be called, right?  Yeah.  The filters.  And then, you know, I was so happy for Jimmy.  I tweeted how, you know, just a great time here in Somerville.  And I wrote Somerville, Boston, and just Twitter losers.  It's not in Boston. 
[00:09:30]  So I wrote, man, dude, you might want to, like, check your fucking blood pressure if that's what bothers you.  Who cares?  I know Somerville officially isn't in Boston, but it's like the whole Boston market I was kind of, like, saying hi to in that one tweet.  You know it's not in Boston.  Gotcha.  It's Somerville, Massachusetts.  Oh, brother.  Oh, brother.  I'm like, good luck to you, brother.  If that's what fucking bothers you, then I don't know, man. 
[00:10:00]  You know, get the blood pressure fucking checked.  Oh, my goodness.  But it was very successful up there.  And Patrice's mom came to the first show.  Yes, she did.  And I didn't know where she was.  I was aware that she was there.  And at the end, I introduced her.  We didn't get her on camera.  But that was because I had no cameras in the audience.  And I knew you guys weren't going to be in the audience.  So I never thought to tell them, right?  They just reminded me right before, oh, Georgia O'Neill is here.  I was like, fuck.  I knew there was no way to get a camera on her.  Right.  But the crowd went crazy when I announced her. 
[00:10:30]  So I may even, like when Pryor did, he did his special in Long Beach and Huey P.  Newton was there.  Huey P.  Newton.  Yeah, it was Huey P.  And you didn't see Huey on camera.  Right.  Which may have been the movie company's thing because he was a Black Panther.  They didn't want to show him.  But, you know, so you can introduce people without them being seen.  Yeah, that's true.  But I still may show that because I was really happy she came.  It might work.  You might figure out something for that.  Yeah, she was really cool.  Gave us all the little T-shirts in between shows.  And it was good to see her.  But you really, when you, and I knew she was there before the show. 
[00:11:00]  And it's like, you know, it's Patrice's mother.  And I didn't feel nervous that my friend's mother was there.  Right.  But it was like, he was such a great comic.  You just feel like, as I was doing jokes, I really was thinking of her being in the audience.  Oh, wow.  And saying, like, you know, like, I'm killing here.  But I'm just thinking of, like, how great Patrice was.  And it's like, I hope this fucking measures up.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it was really weird.  It was running through my head knowing she was in the room.  Right.  You don't want to perform in front of a great comic's mother.  You did great.  No, but you know what I'm saying?  You did absolutely great.  If a shitty comic died and his mom came, I'd be like, yeah, you're lucky to be here, bitch. 
[00:11:30]  But, you know, Patrice's mom would be like, oh, fuck.  I hope this is good.  And that Harvard area, Cambridge.  Yeah.  Cambridge, Boston?  Yeah, Cambridge, Boston.  Wow, man, I love walking around there.  It's fucking cool.  Although, it's gotten corporate since we lived up there.  Really?  I still love walking around, yeah, Harvard Square and all that.  Because they had all those cool little record shops and cool little, like, T-shirt shops  and just things you didn't really see anywhere else. 
[00:12:00]  That was the alt-90s.  I know.  You know?  I know, because we left in, what, 98?  Yeah.  But, I mean, they have...  I saw three.  There might have been four Starbucks within that little area.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  Them days is gone.  But they used to have cool little coffee shops.  I mean, what's wrong with having a nice little local coffee shop?  Why does Starbucks have to take over every fucking coffee location?  That's what it is.  The little coffee shop can't survive with Starbucks there. 
[00:12:30]  I mean, Starbucks absolutely does a good job, and they have a cool one that overlooks Harvard  Square that's, like, two levels, and they do music up top, and they got, like, a bar  area and stuff.  Really, really cool, but I don't know.  I miss those mom-and-pop places.  Yeah.  Way of the world, huh?  They got Urban Outfitters.  I think they had two Urban Outfitters.  But Urban Outfitters is everywhere.  Yeah.  It gets to a point you don't really need to travel anymore.  No, everything you're going to see in some other city.  What are you looking at when you travel?  You're going to see it in some other city. 
[00:13:00]  It's a different skyline.  That's what you're looking at.  That's about it, right?  Yeah, look at that.  It's a different skyline, but I'm getting all the same shit.  I still walked around.  I love fucking just walking around and people watching and shit, but I don't know.  And then I took the choo-choo train all the way to Philly for Easter.  Oh.  And Easter has become like a mini Christmas.  When you have kids, it's a mini Christmas.  What happened to hiding a couple eggs and giving them a couple of fucking treats?  There were presents.  You should see the car I packed last night. 
[00:13:30]  Really?  Holy fuck.  Pain in the ass?  Or was it a...  I think the kid got four different Easter baskets because then, you know, everyone, it's like  a Christmas present.  So every little, you know, every offshoot of the family has to get them an Easter basket.  Was he running around like he's on drugs from the chocolate?  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  He was loving it.  He was loving it.  And then I got spanked on the way home.  I'm like, we left a little later than usual because we had dinner late.  And I'm like, ah, man, the traffic.  Everyone's going to be, you know, well on their way home. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And we take the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  I was telling you this before the show, but whatever.  And then there's this long fucking wide banking turn that leads to the New Jersey Turnpike.  Yeah.  And it's hit or miss, man.  Sometimes you make that turn or whatever, the bank, and it's clear sailing.  Sometimes it's not clear sailing.  And that's what happened last night.  We were rocking up until that point, and then it was dead stop.  That does suck.  We left at 9.30.  I got to, you know, my place at 12.30, three hours. 
[00:14:30]  It usually takes, like, fuck, maybe an hour and a half, hour and 45 minutes.  Oh, is that fucking.  20 miles an hour.  When you fucking come around, you're going, yeah, we're cranking.  I think this is going to be a good.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  You just see taillights and it's over, Johnny.  And it was one of those rainy nights.  It was a foggy night.  Yeah.  And then I look at my wife and go, oh, and on top of that, I forgot my driving glasses.  Oh, no.  So I wore hers.  She goes, try mine. 
[00:15:00]  And they actually kind of worked, like, everything was, like, way sharper, but it gave me, like,  a horrendous eye headache because I can't explain what wasn't right.  Something's not right, so your eyes are trying to compensate for that.  Yeah, because it definitely made me see things better, but it's something.  I can't explain what was wrong.  Maybe one of the eyes or something gave me a horrendous eye headache.  And then I try to wear them as bifocals, so I'm like, all right, I'll use my regular eyes,  but then when I feel like I need a little more of a better look, you know, I'll pop them up. 
[00:15:30]  Tip up a little bit.  Oh, man.  It was fucking, it just fucking threw me in a tizzy, but.  There was a big 10-car accident on a Pennsylvania turnpike.  That's why there was traffic.  Yeah.  April Fools.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, brother.  We're the masters of April Fools.  You can't do this.  You can't do this.  It's his favorite holiday.  Is it?  It's going to be a fucking crazy day.  Strap in.  Strap in.  It's going to be nuts.  Chippa loves April Fools.  You're all going to be scratching your fucking heads like, what the fuck just happened here? 
[00:16:00]  Ah, Chippa.  You do anything for Easter?  Went over to the family's house.  Hung out there.  You're kind of a family guy.  Ah, I love my family.  You kind of are, though, as much as you like, kind of like, you know, live alone or whatever.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But during the holidays, you're always with family.  They're fucking great.  They either come over to my house or this time I went over to my aunt and uncle's there in East Northport and sat around. 
[00:16:30]  It's just, they're fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Just sit there and, you know, I could ramble on about everything and they're just laughing at me.  They laugh and laugh.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Oh, they join in with my little social conversations.  Oh, I can only imagine.  And commentary.  I can only imagine.  Oh, boy.  Batting down the hatches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you partake in the candy?  No, I'm really not.  I've said in the past, I got candy all over the fucking house. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know why Angie decides to just buy this glass jars everywhere just full of fucking candy.  Right.  And I really don't eat it that much.  Even a good peep?  No.  You don't like peeps?  Peeps?  I love peeps.  And I will enjoy a Twizzler or two.  A Twizzler out of everything you can have.  Yeah, I know.  I just sit there and...  I know people go, yeah, Twizzlers.  I like good Twizzlers.  Is there better stuff than Twizzlers in the end?  There's plenty of better stuff than Twizzlers. 
[00:17:30]  Cadbury egg?  I just don't fucking...  Oh, they're good.  I hate a Cadbury.  Do you really?  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of the Cadbury egg.  Why?  I don't know.  Is it because it's a cad?  It's good.  Hey, don't be a cad.  It's got that goop in it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not a fan of the goop.  I love a Cadbury egg.  I'm not a fan of the Cadbury egg.  We had regular hard-boiled eggs.  They were pickled in beet juice.  People were gobbling that shit up.  Really?  Oh, got it.  I took one bite.  I hated it. 
[00:18:00]  Why not just leave them as eggs?  And I like beets in my juice.  Huh?  Why not just leave them as hard-boiled eggs?  They have something a little different, I guess.  I don't know.  They got it from the Amish.  Different schmifrent.  Give me an egg.  They went to the Amish country and got some treats.  One of them was these pickled hard-boiled fucking beet eggs.  I don't know.  Damn, no.  Nah.  Was it vinegary?  Yeah.  Tastes like that kind of, like they went bad?  Yeah.  Why do you want to make something that tastes like it went bad?  I know.  And when we were dipping the old eggs and dyeing them the night before, a lot of people would 
[00:18:30]  say, man, vinegar just smells horrible.  And I go, well, let me tell you a little story.  Ah.  When I was growing up, we had the beach house in Waiting River, and we got horrendous  sunburns, because I don't think they invented, like, suntan lotion when we were growing  up.  Was it around and my family was too poor to get it?  Yeah.  It wasn't like sunscreen.  They'd give you, like, stuff that was, like, to tan better.  It's suntan lotion.  So it was like, I think, just to moisturize your skin.  I think it was just oil, right? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  To make you get a better tan?  Yeah.  I don't think it fucking protected you.  I think all we had was that zinc shit.  Yeah.  That was basically just trying to, you know, block your skin from the sun.  I mean, completely block it.  Anyway, we used to get horrendous fucking sunburns, my whole family.  And my dad, his remedy was putting vinegar on it.  So then you'd be laying in bed.  You know those sunburns where even just moving an inch was fucking misery?  You get that delayed, like, a few seconds later. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, God.  Ow, why does this hurt?  Oh, yeah, I just scratched.  Ow.  So picture that, and then also smelling like vinegar in your bed all night.  Nice.  I guess it took the sting out for a little bit.  Did it?  A little bit.  But then you'd just stink like vinegar.  Oh, it was horrendous.  It's like a giant douche just laying there.  Yeah.  He also, his remedy for athlete's foot, because I spent a lot of my years playing basketball,  so sweaty socks, I had athlete's foot all the time.  Instead of getting the fucking foot sprays, they'd definitely around back then. 
[00:20:00]  He said, no, just, you know, put some soap in between the toes and kind of let it dry.  Oh, that would make it so much worse.  Wow.  That shit would dry up and make it way itchier.  But that was his remedy for that, too.  Wow.  He said, you know, wash up good, but keep the soap in there.  Don't rinse out the soap.  That's not a good soap.  I don't think that's good.  No, I don't.  Well, he'd try, but.  And then dump vinegar on it.  Yeah, the vinegar on the sunburn, though.  Fuck. 
[00:20:30]  I'm not a fan of vinegar.  No.  Uh-uh.  Vin or anyone.  Oh, and then the choo-choo.  Yeah, the choo-choo.  Can we talk about the Acceler for a minute?  Sure.  Those fucking assholes.  I mean, the people that work on it are really, really nice.  We were lucky to do the whole first class car, but we learned the only thing you get that  a regular ticket doesn't is really, really, and I mean really shitty food.  It could be the worst food I've ever eaten. 
[00:21:00]  It's terrible.  And they brag on the menu that Chef Blah Blah has prepared the Blah Blah Blah for Amtrak.  Chef Himmler.  I would be embarrassed if I was in that industry and my name was on that.  Dude, it's the worst food I've ever had.  I've had it.  It's fucking terrible.  But how, yeah, okay, so I'm not telling you anything you don't know.  But why don't the Amtrak people get together and go, obviously our food sucks.  There's got to be something we could do.  Yeah.  Because they figured it out for airplanes. 
[00:21:30]  You get an all right meal.  You know what?  That first class on a pretty good airline, that tastes fucking good.  I like it.  It's not like airline food.  Pretty goddamn good.  I had an egg omelet.  I don't even know.  I've had the egg beaters or whatever, so I don't know what it was.  Really?  Maybe it was powdered eggs they make into an omelet?  Oh, probably.  I don't know, though.  But how do you fuck up eggs?  And then on the way up to Boston, we were all fucking tired because we did the show and  stuff, and we're sleeping, and then we wake up and have a little lunch. 
[00:22:00]  And they have a healthy option.  It was a pork.  And it was like creamed spinach.  So I look at the lady like, well, I wanted the healthy version of this because it looked  like that's what it says on the menu.  It goes, this is healthy.  Creamed spinach isn't healthy?  Creamed anything.  You can't put that on your menu as healthy?  They fucking are just abominable.  I was so scared to eat it going on the way up because I'm like, I trust this so little.  I don't want to get sick the day before a shoot. 
[00:22:30]  So I didn't eat any of it.  I didn't trust it.  It was god-awful how bad it was.  Yeah.  I have to say.  And I was sitting with Jonathan, one of Jimmy's guys, on the way back down to New York first.  They got off there and went all the way to Philly, whatever.  And he got the egg omelet.  He was so depressed.  He goes to the guy.  We had this guy, Jay, who was really cool.  If you see him on the Excel, tell him we said hi.  And Jonathan goes, do you mind if I just get cereal?  And I'm not sure if it was Jay that said this, but one of the guys, he goes, yeah, I don't blame you. 
[00:23:00]  He even knows.  He goes, yeah, I don't blame you.  I'll get you some cereal.  Because you can't fuck that up, you know?  Yeah, they can't figure that shit out.  Isn't that just fucking, again, a government-run fucking train?  Is it?  Train?  So it's like, yeah.  It's like, they can't do anything right.  It was horrendous how bad it was.  So bad.  Terrible.  Good luck.  Yeah, booze.  That's about it.  Just go in and get fucking booze, beers. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  That they can do right.  Yeah.  And Jimmy, you know, he eats really, you know, carefully before these big shows.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't want to get fucking food poisoning.  Because I was suggesting we maybe get some sushi or something.  Oh, man.  And Jimmy's like, no, I don't believe in it.  It's, you know, a night before a gig.  It exists.  I forgot to tell you this.  On Friday, I had some bad sushi.  Did you really?  I think so.  Why?  What did you feel?  I had some problems.  Vomit or shit? 
[00:24:00]  The shitty was a little, the shitty.  That shit was a little loosey-goosey.  It wasn't officially water, but it was a little loosey.  I'm like, oh, boy.  Jimmy's right.  Yeah, don't fuck around, man.  I ate bad after this shit.  I said I'm going to treat myself.  So I ate a cheeseburger, and I had a piece of pie with some ice cream and a little bag of, what's that?  Chips.  Chips.  And next morning, I had some raisin bran and fucking, what did I have?  I bought a bag of pretzels, and I ate that, like, last night and the night before. 
[00:24:30]  I split it over two nights, and I'm done eating bad.  That was my big binge.  That was your binge?  It wasn't that bad.  Oh, back to your special.  There's a couple things.  I'm so happy that, I have to say this one thing, that you worked the gym dude into your set.  Oh, yeah.  I'm so happy.  You know the creep that we've been talking about?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Off and on.  He worked him into his fucking special.  Five-minute hunk.  And they fucking loved it. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I'm so happy that made the special.  I don't know why.  That and the juicy ass girl from the gym.  Both of them.  I talk about both of them.  The juicy ass.  But the shit on the creep in our locker room, fuck, it makes me happy that made it.  And somewhere out there, that guy has no idea that he's going to be a big part of your special that people are going to love.  I hope so.  I hope he sees it one day, and he's like, who is that guy?  And then the other thing, I don't know if Jimmy told you.  Dude, has he told you about his open?  No, I'm not going to say.  No, I know you're not going to.  No, no. 
[00:25:30]  For his last special, it was Ozzy was the big reveal.  Uh-huh.  Holy.  His open for this is fucking amazing.  Yeah.  A lot of people are tweeting, but I don't.  I didn't see what it was.  I have to get a copy of it, and I'll show it to you.  And the laughs were all absolutely there, man.  It was right before.  It was what I wanted it to be, and I got a lot of resistance from the network on it because  it's definitely weird, and I'm like, I know this audience, and I know the beats of where 
[00:26:00]  the laughs will come, and boom, boom, and they came.  I was in the back before that first show when I heard the fucking laughs building on it.  I was like, fuck it, yes.  I was so happy walking out.  Because you never know for sure ever, right?  You never know for sure.  I'm like, what if they fucking star face it?  Of course.  What if they don't respond the way I think they're going to?  Yeah, then you just blow it off.  You don't even use it in your special.  I would have had to do that.  Oh, God.  But the network was like, no, no.  Right.  You've got to give us a tamed down version. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  And it was a really big point of contention, and I had backed off on a couple of other things that  I wanted.  I can't imagine it backed off.  Nothing.  No, I did one thing I wanted, which my ex-girlfriend suggested, which was, you know, I had these  hanging lights.  It's in front of a sectional flag, kind of a backwards flag, and I wanted to have nooses  because it was, you know, just this stupid, A, it looked cool, but B, you know, I think  that Americans fucking, you know, we like to hang each other for, you know, it's just like  I wanted it, but they said, absolutely not. 
[00:27:00]  They said Viacom, which Epic is Viacom, has a no-noose policy, and that might be a major  problem.  And I was like, I'm afraid if I shoot it like this, what if I, what if some fucking lawyer,  not the Epic's people, what if some way high-up lawyer at Viacom goes, I don't care what  he's trying to say, no nooses.  Right, right.  It wasn't worth the chance.  Yeah, it's too much of a risk in the end.  Definitely.  Because it goes on Epic's, I think, in June or July, and then three months later, it's  on Netflix.  And that's what I really wanted to do, was get it on Epic's and Netflix. 
[00:27:30]  So that was something I backed off on pretty easily, but this other one, I was like, ugh.  And in fairness, they let me do it.  They're like, all right.  I know that they're basically going, if it fucking bombs, you have some explaining to  do.  Some explaining to do.  But I fucking loved it, man.  I was so fucking happy after Boston.  The opening was great.  I just couldn't have been happier.  Let's see how to Angelo.  So, Angelo, you're going to explain the eggs on the train?  How do you do that?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  So, when I was in high school, my old man worked at the airport. 
[00:28:00]  When it was called Idlewire.  Anyway, they used to take...  Idlewire?  Yeah, something to that effect.  But anyway, they used to take these big eggs, like a sack of potatoes, like a sack of  potatoes.  It was flakes.  And they put it in boiling water, and they would spin, and spin, and eventually, it turned  into an egg.  White, powdery egg.  But that's exactly how they make that food.  So, it comes out of it like a...  Think of like a pancake mix or something like that.  Just like that.  And they pour it into water, and they put a couple things in it, and then it turns into 
[00:28:30]  eggs.  It really is shit.  Like, on a plane, the food...  In coach, the food is better.  You have to buy it now.  Yeah, but it's good.  It's all right.  Yeah.  It's very animal.  I don't mind it at all.  I buy coach...  Oh, that shit on a plate.  Sorry.  No, go ahead, buddy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, I love you, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  It's hard on the phone, so I was actually...  I wasn't being sarcastic.  I was...  I was saying, sorry.  I think you are being sarcastic.  You're pissing me off.  Wow.  It's fucking early. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Does it say the chef's name and all that, right?  You can get fucking poisoned on a plane.  A friend of mine died one time when he was on a fucking plane because the food was so  bad.  Wow.  Apple Fools.  Oh, shit.  Wow, you got us, too.  That's crazy.  Ship is great.  Strap in.  You don't know what to believe.  We're strapped in.  You don't know what the fuck's happening today.  Good luck getting through today.  Oh, no.  Is that the chef?  Amtrak Culinary Advisory Team.  I would be embarrassed if I was one of these guys. 
[00:29:30]  Could you take my picture down off your site?  Holy fuck.  And they got the chef coats and everything.  They look like...  How many there are?  Yeah, they look like they work at five-star restaurants, too.  But at the bottom, show them guy that says no to everything the above suggests.  They're just advising.  I would be embarrassed if I was...  Yeah.  If they had my picture.  There's not one person that gets...  Well, it gets off that Excel and goes, man, I got to tell you, man.  I had a terrific fucking meal between New York and Philly.  I really want to thank you.  Is the chef on board? 
[00:30:00]  I'd really like to just thank him personally.  My compliments.  Shit.  What a love.  Look how many people there are that do this.  And the menu barely has any choices.  No.  That's another thing.  They probably paid up the ass to do this.  They lose money.  Well, they could save fucking...  They could save money that way.  Yeah.  Fucking fire your chefs.  They're not doing anything.  Fire those guys.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  Yeah, so, I mean... 
[00:30:30]  Make a deal with fucking Taco Bell or something.  I wouldn't even trust the bagel.  I mean, just go cereal.  Amtrak signature steak.  Ew!  Oh, you assholes.  Ah, an Amtrak steak.  We didn't even have that option.  They're trying to be like Morton's or fucking...  Signature steak.  It was signed by Kevorkian.  Fucking douches.  Food stinks.  Terrible.  We didn't have the signature steak as an option.  No.  And on their menu is shrimp and pasta.  You're going to have shrimp on a train? 
[00:31:00]  Good luck.  There's shrimp on a train.  You know how, like, good sushi places will say it was flown in?  This shrimp, they brag, was pulled in by a rickshaw from Omaha.  Two guys pulled it on a rickshaw on a fucking cooler.  Oh, shit.  Oh, creme brulee.  Really?  Oh, starters.  We weren't offered the creme brulee, so I guess this is for their website to make it  look a little better?  Yes, the creme brulee.  Because they didn't even offer the shrimp and pasta. 
[00:31:30]  Well, that's the evening menu.  Start with a rainbow berry salad.  This week, we recommend...  A rainbow berry salad.  And then the Amtrak signature steak.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, boy.  Wait, can we see the menu for what we have?  It was pretty much this.  Breakfast and lunch.  This is the exact menu.  It just has a couple of things that are different.  Yeah, I mean, because...  Yeah, it's the afternoon and evening thing, Jimmy.  We just didn't have the...  Oh, wait.  They had the roasted beef eye round.  Oh, that's roasted beef eye round. 
[00:32:00]  And pasta with Parmesan cream.  I don't believe in pasta unless it has a red sauce.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I like a good fucking yellow...  I'm sorry.  It's just...  And then they...  Yeah.  No, it's...  I don't mind it with a white...  Really?  ...kind of some...  Sometimes.  You just feel like you're missing out on something.  And then they have a shrimp and a soie salad.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's exactly what you want, uncooked.  It was stored in the fucking glove compartment to the conductor's Buick.  Now, do they have... 
[00:32:30]  What did we have for lunch?  The afternoon was...  I had a...  I tried the pork because it said healthy option.  Oh, God.  Where's the mandarin chicken?  I was trying to eat healthy.  No, when Easter was a day or two away.  Oh, herb-roasted chicken.  No.  We didn't have that.  We had a mandarin chicken salad, which I ordered, and the chicken had orange gunk on it  to make it fucking stunk.  I took one bite.  It tasted like it was coated in gasoline.  I'm like, I'm not eating this shit.  Yeah.  I had that on the way out of Boston.  I'm confusing my cities at this point.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  The chicken looked like they dyed it.  Oh, God.  It's terrible.  And here's how they talk about the Asian chicken salad.  Sesame-crusted chicken breast served over mixed greens with red cabbage, mandarin oranges,  shredded carrots, and red peppers.  Sounds delicious.  Sounds great.  It sure does.  The mandarin oranges are my salad that looked sad.  They just looked sad.  It's not happy to be there.  They were kind of mushy.  Like clown eyebrows.  Fucking horrible.  A pork tenderloin.  That's what I had. 
[00:33:30]  Ah, the pork tenderloin.  See, look.  Healthy menu option.  And then it says, sea plane.  Wait until destination.  You explain to me how this is the healthy, where is it again?  Healthy menu option.  It says it right there.  All right.  Pork tenderloin.  So I'm thinking healthy menu option.  Maybe they just make this healthy if you ask for it.  So I've said that.  We'll broil you a pork tenderloin.  Seared pork tenderloin served in a Dijon cream sauce. 
[00:34:00]  Cream and health don't go together.  Not at all.  With a bulgur wheat pilaf, which was fucking horrendous.  And creamy spinach.  How is that healthy?  Well, it's healthy because it's the stuff that doesn't have.  There's two creams on the fucking dish.  Because it doesn't have food poisoning in it.  The other stuff, they actually sprinkle botulism.  If you read the actual menu, it says, with just a smidge of botulism.  You can't have healthy menu option.  And then two of the things in the dish are cream based. 
[00:34:30]  See that right there?  Tomato.  See that?  Look, with a pinch of E. coli.  Yeah.  A pinch of E. coli.  Dash.  Right there.  Breakfast.  Stool softeners.  That's not good.  E. coli.  The warming.  Stool looseners.  From Boston to New York, I had the Asian chicken salad.  And then I washed out my mouth with their triple chocolate parfait.  How was that?  That was really good.  It got the bad taste of the Asian chicken salad out of my mouth. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  That just sounds awful.  Dude, I'm telling you, worst food I've ever had.  It was horrendous.  Fucking terrible, dude.  It was so fucking bad.  I was amazed that a company would just serve this and just think it's fine.  That's why I love having this radio show.  We could say this shit that other people don't have the...  Don't have the...  The means.  The means.  Thank you.  The outlet.  Yes.  The outlet, I should have said.  Sure.  Let's go to Frank in Manhattan.  He's a regular.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys. 
[00:35:30]  Hey.  Frank, what's better?  Hey, have you ever had the Amtrak cheeseburger?  Oh, yes.  You've had the Amtrak cheeseburger.  That's fucking terrible.  Dude, there's like little lumps of fucking gristle in it.  It's horrible.  Well, that's not the worst part.  It must be made with like gasoline because it gives you the screaming shit like 10 minutes  after eating it.  It's awfulness.  By the way, if you remember, when we were in D.C., I cut one of the worst farts ever. 
[00:36:00]  Do you have that audio?  E-Rock of Anthony going, oh, Jimmy.  And I know that's happened a million times, but this is one we've played a lot.  Okay.  Wow.  E-Rock, are you in there?  Are you?  E-Rock, are you in there?  No, I can't see because of the reflection.  But I'm mentioning this for a reason.  You can't see him?  Are you right?  No, it's the reflection.  I can just see me.  Oh, big.  Oh, my God.  While he was looking for that, I cooked up some of that goddamn pasta and put some of 
[00:36:30]  that sundae gravy on it.  Is that the most amazing shit?  Dude, it was so fucking good.  I sat there.  I had to lay down on the couch going like, oh, when I was done because I was so full.  I couldn't stop.  I couldn't fucking stop.  And then, you know, where we live, my neighborhood, I can't find a good goddamn red sauce.  And the sundae gravy people, it is the best fucking...  Dude, I was fucking like, I couldn't stop eating it.  I call it pasta sauce, whatever. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, it's not like...  I know you Italians love calling it gravy.  No, I call it sauce.  I don't know who fucking calls it gravy.  It's the best red sauce I've ever had in my fucking life.  Where are they located?  They're online, mostly.  They're kind of here and there.  People are bitching about the price of it.  Was it expensive?  I guess it's pretty expensive per jar.  But it's like, someone goes, I'm not paying that much for...  How much is it a jar?  I don't even know, but it's not cheap.  Did you...  $70?  For two big jars?  $70?  Crazy. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, that's cheap!  Holy fuck!  I used to spend $250 on the best sauce.  Where did you spend $250?  Bad for fools!  Oh, shit!  Fucking three for three, cocksucker!  You know what the difference is?  I know, for two jars.  Is that good or no?  I don't buy sauce.  They're big jars.  Is that good?  Dude, they are big jars.  I got like the big jar at home that I took here.  Can you sit in it after?  You could bathe in it, yes.  And it's not like sauce.  They're 32-ounce jars.  How big is 32 ounces now?  I don't know.  It's pretty big.  This water bottle is... 
[00:38:00]  Twelve, right?  17, almost 17 ounces.  See, it's almost...  It's just under two of those.  That's a big...  Also, you don't pour it out like tomato sauce.  It's not just tomato sauce.  It's so packed with meat...  Yeah.  ...that you gotta like spoon the shit out.  Know what I do?  It sounds like you're describing your ass off.  It's so packed with shit.  No, packed with meat.  Yes.  Oh, packed with meat.  Yes.  Jesus. 
[00:38:30]  Know what I do with that?  Dick horn.  You take their amazing Sunday gravy and you water it down a little bit.  So it lasts longer so I get a nice jar of Prego?  Yeah.  No.  No.  You don't fucking water it down so it lasts longer.  With Prego?  No.  I thought Prego was a good sauce until I started making, like, some money.  Yeah.  Prego was my go-to sauce.  That was my go-to.  For a long time.  I was like, what are you, a savage?  I had it recently somewhere, I forget, and I was like, wow, I used to like this? 
[00:39:00]  I used to like the Prego.  We're killing companies today.  I know.  Destruction.  That's really good stuff, right?  That Sunday gravy?  Oh, it's so fucking good.  Do you have the audio, York?  There's a lot of fart audio.  I don't know.  There's a lot of fart audio.  Of course there is.  It was from D.C.  Yeah, I'm trying to find it.  Nah, you know what?  That's a weird pull for me to ask for.  You know, when this show is done, I think we gotta put all our fart audio in a time capsule.  Oh, my God, it should be.  We really gotta bury the fart audio somewhere. 
[00:39:30]  For future generations to find.  Yeah.  It's one of the best clips.  We're in D.C., and Anthony goes, oh, God, oh, Jimmy, oh!  It was one of those.  Right.  But I'm like, I had a burger on the Metro line.  Oh, there it is.  It was the fucking burger that got me, and it was brutal.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking one of my worst farts ever was one of those train hamburger, the burger the guy called.  That's saying a lot.  I gotta talk to the Sunday gravy people, man.  I think they dropped their price a little bit.  They're gonna move a hell of a lot more product.  I don't know what it is.  It must be the meats they use.  I don't think it's that expensive for, I don't know.  That's chipping, right? 
[00:40:00]  Is that chipping included or no?  Who am I to say?  But $70 for two, so that's 64 ounces of sauce in the end.  For 70 bucks, that is a bit expensive.  That's what I was saying.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  You do know that they ship that in an envelope.  But it's goddamn good.  They actually just put that in an envelope and take their chances.  It never comes intact.  But it was some of the best, like, there hasn't been a restaurant I've gone to or anything.  That is like if your fucking grandmother cooked really well years ago when you were growing up and you remember how great that is. 
[00:40:30]  That's how that fucking tasted.  It was unbelievably amazing.  Yeah, I loved it.  I loved their shit.  And that ain't a commercial or anything.  I just fucking packed myself with it.  We're all about Plagolo.  Late in our careers, it's all about getting free shit.  And they sent, they also, I wasn't sent, I took before I left, that package of pasta that they also sent.  And I cooked that shit up and it was like gourmet shit.  That wasn't no fucking crap sauce. 
[00:41:00]  I can smell like a day going on a Wednesday back in the day.  I'm going to order some of that stuff.  I'm telling you, it's amazing.  I'm going to have a nice pasta.  I've had pasta in a long time.  I'm going to have a gal come over and I'm going to say, can the girl cook and say, can you cook this up?  A gal or a gal?  A gal.  You know, a G-A-L.  Because the other gals eat a little, they might eat you out of the house in a row.  All right, daddy, I'll supply the sausage.  Well, that's what I misunderstood.  Do you mean a girl or a G-U-R-L?  There is a difference.  I was going to have a young lady prepare this stuff and then we'd have a nice meal. 
[00:41:30]  And then after, after she cleans up, she gets her ass fucked.  Jesus.  Just a nice romantic evening.  But I'm going to say, look, I'll provide the pasta and I'll provide the Sunday gravy and the kitchen.  You do the cooking and cleaning.  Right.  Clean it up.  And you get your ass fucked.  And that's part of the deal.  That's dessert.  What an awful date.  Me fucking, me hosing my dick off in the sink after I'm finished.  They do all the work.  She does all the work. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And you fuck her in the ass.  Yeah.  Then she gets a fucking rump full of goo.  Jesus.  Take this, madam.  I didn't forget.  So the burger was, had gristle in it, you said, or?  Yeah.  There was like a fucking.  On Amtrak.  Like it was ground up bones and gristle and everything else.  What are they doing?  Terrible.  I know.  They're like, what?  Bankrupt?  Even though they're still running trains or something?  Did they figure that out yet?  Of course not.  They're awful.  Wow.  It's bad.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Stupid.  And way over like cooked, which is good, I guess, because God knows what kind of bacteria  is running around in fucking the Amtrak burger.  Maybe the pork gave me the Lucy.  Yeah, absolutely.  The Lucy Bells.  Something you ate there might have.  Because I was assuming it was the sushi I had in Harvard Square.  Yeah, I don't fuck.  I just, because traveling so much, the great fear is just getting sick when you can't.  Like if you're in a hotel, it sucks.  I mean, when me and my ex went to Vegas that time, I ate some sushi in the fucking, or 
[00:43:00]  some crab or something in the hotel.  Oh boy.  And I'm like, I don't eat seafood in Vegas.  Because you know that it didn't.  Where did it come from?  No, I think Vegas is a safe place, believe it or not.  Because, you know, they're moving food.  They're going to fucking fly it in from some good places.  Wherever they flew it in from.  Well, this one, this was a bad one.  This was a fucking Arizona piece of fish.  Gotcha.  And you know what else you don't know?  You don't know if, yeah, they're flying it in.  But what if the flight's delayed?  Yeah.  Like, for you, it sucks.  You just sit there on the plane, you're waiting, or back in there.  For a fucking shrimp, they're just sitting there as the ice is melting in a nice warm cargo hold. 
[00:43:30]  And you know, I've seen enough delivery trucks around New York City.  Most of you guys are cool.  But I saw a guy on Columbus Avenue.  I forgot to tell you this story.  Oh, no.  Where, like, he opened the back door and all the bagels fell out onto the fucking dirty road.  Yeah.  And I remember, and I didn't have a video camera, I'm so bummed, I didn't have anything that day.  And I'm like, I want to see what this guy fucking does.  He's in a bad spot, if you think about it, because if he throws all the bagels away or tells the, you know, his boss, look, I had an accident. 
[00:44:00]  And obviously, we can't sell bagels that were laying on the fucking street.  Oh, boy.  So I'm like, what is he going to do?  He put those fucking bagels back in that fucking bag.  Of course he did.  Like, nothing happened.  Closed that door and, you know, kept delivering.  Ah, it was in a gutter of a New York street.  Yeah.  But then I was really breaking it out.  I'm like, I don't think those guys have a choice. 
[00:44:30]  No.  Because if they go back and do the right thing, they're going to get fucking fired, man.  Unbelievable.  Right?  What's better than a hot bagel out of one of those fucking H&H stores, whatever the fuck they're called?  Fuck.  Oh, God, they're amazing.  It does like a good bagel.  Oh, a poppy bagel and everything.  It just smells like a hot bagel.  Careful.  Don't touch that one.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Good advice.  I already ordered my food today, because, I mean, when I go down to fucking Philly, like I said last time, they don't believe in vegetables. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, wherever I go.  Wherever I go.  So what do they think?  Those people in the hospital are just tired?  It does a good salad every once in a while, but in general, there's no vegetables to be had.  It's all about cheesesteaks and fucking crab fries.  From chinks?  Chinks.  You know, that's a big story in Philly.  I know.  It was a big story here.  What?  It broke over here.  Chinks steaks, cheesesteaks, I guess.  What's the official name?  Chinks.  I guess they just call themselves Chinks, and they have the cheesesteaks down there in Philly. 
[00:45:30]  They finally changed their name.  Yep.  This has been in the news for a while.  And they went with Joe's.  Now it's Joe's.  Because his name was Joe Chink something.  Right.  Like, his nickname was Chink, and now it's just Joe's.  Now a lot of people pissed off that, you know, this place that's been around forever, and  it was called Chinks, had to change his name.  But in the end, I was talking to a lot of the gang down there.  They said, you know, people were throwing fucking bricks and everything through the guy's 
[00:46:00]  windows.  Jesus.  They were basically like, you're going to fucking change this name.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  It got pretty fucking ugly.  What was the name?  How did he get the nickname?  See, there it is.  Chinks.  I don't know.  I don't know how Joe got the little nickname.  What was his last name?  Well, his name was Sam.  Oh, it was Sam?  I thought it was Joe.  Yeah.  Samuel Chink Sherman.  Oh, Sammy Chink Sherman.  Opened a clean mom and pop steak shop.  What year?  1949.  It was there forever.  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:30]  1949.  No one really cared about that word.  That's for sure.  No, you could just tell him, look, that's your name.  You know, deal with it.  Yeah.  There was a time where we just lived differently.  Okay.  It was right next to Spook's Chicken.  Right?  They didn't give a fuck.  Hey, come in and get a kike sausage.  They're delicious.  Give you a fucking Nick burger to go with that.  You know our elders, our parents, they didn't have the term politically correct or political 
[00:47:00]  correctness.  Not at all.  That's a made-up term.  Yeah, it really is.  And only the last, I would say, maybe 20 years tops.  Yep.  Before that, that wasn't an actual term.  Yeah, when you really tear it apart, it's like politically correct.  What the fuck does it even mean?  I don't know.  Chink died.  And then Joe worked for him for 20 years.  So now Joe owns the shop.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but I was kind of pissed off going, man, another store that has caved into pressure. 
[00:47:30]  But then you break it down, man.  It was almost tough to fucking run the business.  They were throwing cinder blocks and all sorts of shit through the windows.  Damn.  There are certain things, again, political correctness aside, like chinks, there's certain  times where just because it's politically correct doesn't mean I'm going to disagree  with it.  Like, I could see why people would be mad at something called chinks.  But they weren't mad forever.  This is only very recent.  Yeah.  I mean, it was like that since 1949. 
[00:48:00]  And it wasn't like...  So were white only water fountains.  Yeah.  I guess times change.  But there's nothing else on the menu that is basically, you know, fucking turning the  screw.  Like, see, look, we're getting away with this.  And we also got, you know, slaty-eyed fries and whatever.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It was just the guy's last name in the end.  That was it.  What's the last name?  And that is a normal fucking cheesesteak type menu.  It was his nickname.  It was a nickname.  If it was his real name, that's one thing.  Yeah.  No, it was a nickname. 
[00:48:30]  It was pretty much his name.  Like, my name's not Opie, but it's pretty much my name.  You know what I mean?  So to him, that was his name.  Yeah.  Hmm.  So I think that's a technicality.  People just knew him as that forever.  I wonder why they called him that.  I wonder how he got that nickname.  Yeah, I need to know now.  Now we need to know how he got that nickname.  He probably had a weird look or something like that.  His eyes might have been a little slender.  Maybe he squinted because he had bad eyesight.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Back in those days, I thought you'd do.  If you couldn't see something, instead of getting glasses, you used to do this and people  go, what are you, chink?  Like, you know, they just do it. 
[00:49:00]  Everything was so basic in the 40s.  Oh, so easy.  Maybe he had Down syndrome.  Possibly.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  Maybe they meant that to be something else.  Like chinks.  They said he was a jinx, but he spelled it wrong.  Oh.  I'll just go with that.  Where were we, though?  I don't know.  We're going to get to chinks now.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Because, you know, Philly, they just eat differently down there.  I'm not even fucking, I'm not, you know.  But as soon as I got in today, I'm like, Kenny, give me a fucking huge vegetable juice. 
[00:49:30]  Give me oatmeal, no sugar.  I have the worst sugar headache from eating all that shit yesterday.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I loved it, but I can't eat like that all the time.  So I'm going to cleanse with a good beet, carrot, and spinach juice this morning.  Oh, is it just going to fucking shoot that shit out your ass?  I'm hoping.  Yeah.  I'm going to have one at the gym.  I slept my fucking ass off from my fucking 1240 until I promptly woke up at 235 and stayed up.  Really?  Why?  Two hours? 
[00:50:00]  Not even.  I dreamt I was in a fucking, a reclining chair, but not, that was just sitting up, and I was,  and Colin was standing on the chair, and Jay Moore was involved somehow.  Colin and Jay Moore in your dreams?  Star-studded dream.  And the chair was falling out of the sky.  Yeah.  At like 36,000 feet.  Oh, wow.  We were gliding like a plane, and it was Colin's chair or something, and I remember,  we were over the ocean, and I'm looking down, I'm like, that looks really close, but I knew  we were at like 15,000 feet, and I'm like, just jump, just jump out, and you'll hit the 
[00:50:30]  water, but in my dream, I'm going, no, that's much farther than you think.  Oh, wow.  And in my dream, I'm making myself think of falling, like.  Were you getting that falling feeling?  Yeah, at one point, I was really plummeting, and I'm like, you're going to die.  Oh, no.  I was like, just jump, and I'm like, you're not going to realize how high up you are until  you jump.  Jimmy.  And I forget how I just woke up, I just woke up gasping.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I wonder if that was a drinking dream. 
[00:51:00]  What do you mean?  Not knowing, like, you think it's just going to be this little thing, but there's a lot  farther down you have to go than you realize.  Oh, man.  I don't know what that meant.  It was a really weird one.  Yeah.  That's what woke me up.  Oh, wow.  I was in a fucking, I was in a recliner with Colin, plummeting from 20,000 feet.  And was he just making jokes the whole time?  I don't know.  I think that they were saying, like, well, we're going to die.  Well, we're going to do it in a chair in the clouds.  Right.  Being ironic.  Right.  Fucking plummet.  No, I don't remember.  Hey, this guy knows how Chink got his name there down in Philly. 
[00:51:30]  Steve.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Here's the problem everybody forgets about this story, is that they're all bitching  because it was the guy's nickname when he was a kid.  Right.  But he got the nickname because his eyes were skinny, and they used to say he looked like  a Chink.  That's what I speculated.  Yeah, but the guy embraced it.  Yeah, but they called him a Chink.  Look at this guy.  Where are you, Chinatown?  Right.  Making this call.  Yeah, they called him a Chink.  His eyes are like...  I think they're all looking at me. 
[00:52:00]  I'm not sure, but I think they are, so I've got to fucking whisper this to you.  I work in a morgue, like Jimmy said last time I called.  Yeah, for some reason, we can't acknowledge that people look different.  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  Even though they would make fun of you.  Right back.  That's the thing that we never discuss.  Everyone, every fucking group makes fun of other groups.  Well, they had to come out and say that it wasn't an April Fool's joke because people  thought it was just an April Fool's joke.  Oh, really?  Because today's the official change.  Now, am I wrong? 
[00:52:30]  Because the info I was getting while I was down in Philly, I mean, they were getting  like cinder blocks and shit thrown through the windows, right?  I don't know.  He said he was getting emails that it was going to happen.  Oh, okay.  I don't know if it did happen, but they interviewed some people that work, some Asian people that  have stores on that street, and they said they don't care.  Oh, they didn't care.  Yeah.  They find out most people don't care in the end.  It's some weird special interest group that has a tiny little following that, for some  reason, we'll say it again, has so much fucking power.  Well, listen, you guys didn't hear from me. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  No.  But rumor hasn't.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Steve from Philly.  All right, Steve.  Skinny eyes.  I used to work in a morgue.  Did you, Chip?  Nah, April fools.  Oh, fuck.  Is he good?  Crazy.  Yeah, it's like seven, right?  No, I think it was four.  Maybe.  Where's your food at?  I'm ready to go.  Jimmy's ready to go.  Hot soup.  Anthony's food was here.  I threw it in the garbage.  Oh, Chip.  Why did you throw it?  April fools.  I didn't.  Oh, God. 
[00:53:30]  He's so good at this.  Oh, there's your fucking food.  Yep.  Three more hours.  Thank you.  Hey, your soup has a couch in it.  What?  April fools.  Oh, no.  No.  Not Edgar.  Edgers are not good at all.  No, they're really bad.  They're just really non-sequitur.  He tried to just tell me my soup had a couch in it.  I don't think anyone's falling for that. 
[00:54:00]  April fools.  Wow.  Oh, man.  When we get back, we've got to talk about that fucking injury, man.  Everyone is a fucking fan.  I didn't see the video.  I was trying to watch it, and then the fucking video wasn't playing.  Yeah.  The basketball player, right?  Yeah, we'll get into it.  A lot of weird little things with that.  And a lot of people say it's the worst sports injury ever televised.  I disagree.  As brutal as that was yesterday.  So we'll get into that.  And also, there's a basketball, a female basketball player. 
[00:54:30]  And, you know, of course I tweeted about it.  And then, of course, you got to, yeah, we've been talking about that for years.  All right, but it's new to me, so fuck off.  You're supposed to have known about everything.  My tweets are in my life.  So if it's something new, I'm going to fucking tweet about it.  Like, welcome to the party.  But anyway, yeah, we'll play it after the break.  Play it after the break.  I mean, you can play for Jimmy during the break, but I want to really get into it. 
[00:55:00]  But there's a female basketball player.  Because after the Louisville game, we switched around, and they had some women's basketball on.  There's a broad that's a guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  I played some audio for you this morning.  Oh, crazy.  You would swear that's a guy.  In every way.  Are we allowed to say that?  We're allowed to say anything we want on this show, but I'm saying in general, are you allowed to say that?  Sure.  She's absolutely more of a man than I am. 
[00:55:30]  That's not even near controversial.  I mean, my dick's bigger, but she's more of a man than me.  I'll play the audio for Jimmy.  I heard something, but I could not believe that was a woman.  You couldn't believe it, right?  No, I thought it was a guy.  Oh, and some Mayor Menino audio.  From his press conference, he stepped down, or is stepping down.  I can't believe he had a car accident.  No, I don't think he did.  April Fools.  Fucking God, everybody again.  I don't think he's stirring up the shit. 
[00:56:00]  Some of this stuff's going to go viral today, man.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, E-Rock, you got something on the break, you said?  Yeah, I couldn't find the clip Jimmy wanted, but we found a fan-produced production of that.  Okay.  Perfect.  So this is the famous fart that Jimmy was talking about.  That Anthony reacted to.  Yes.  We said that he rang up, the scores told him, he rang up, it was over 50 grand, something  like that?  Yes.  Over, Jesus Christ, Jimmy. 
[00:56:30]  What?  Holy shit.  Somebody bought it, somebody bought it in here.  Oh, my God.  Somebody bought it in here.  The worst spell ever in my life.  Oh, my God.  Look the way.  That is disgusting.  That is disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  It's in my nostrils.  Somebody bought it, somebody bought it in here.  Dude, that's horrific. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Somebody bought it in here.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  I can't punch you.  It won't stop, stop, stop, stop.  It's awful.  I had a burger on the metro line yesterday.  Oh, my God.  I need something I'm going to throw up.  It could be the worst one ever.  It's like rotting eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  Eggs.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.

[01:00:30]  This anniversary.  Hit it!  I ramped that shit.  This is good stuff.  What is this about? 
[01:01:00]  It's about a great song.  This is one of those songs, every time it's on the radio, you've got to listen to it.  That's a good one.  His father killed him at the age of 44, 29 years ago today. 
[01:01:30]  What?  Marvin Gaye's father.  Marvin Gaye?  Yeah, he shot us.  He got shot by his father.  Yeah?  29 years ago at the age of 44.  Marvin Gaye did this?  What happened?  Marvin Gaye did this song?  Oh, yeah.  You didn't know that?  You know that.  No.  I thought it was like Smokey.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I thought you knew that.  Yeah.  We do Marvin Gaye Day.  Does he have enough hits?  Yeah, yeah.  I know he does.  One other thing about Boston Air. 
[01:02:00]  Marvin Gaye?  Yeah.  All these, after Jimmy's show, yeah, we're hanging, signing, and taking pictures and stuff,  and so many fucking guys, I mean men, coming up and going, you corrupted, you and A corrupted  my brain when I was in fifth grade.  I'm like, oh my God.  Oh, boy.  Our Boston days, at this point, is a distant memory.  Totally.  We've been out of there 15 years.  Crazy.  15 fucking years.  Fucking insane to even think. 
[01:02:30]  Because these guys were men.  They were like pushing 30.  Yeah.  So fifth grade is what, 12, I guess?  Somewhere around there?  11, 12?  That's why it's got to be really fucking awkward for a child molester.  Right.  Like, you've got this little kid, and they're all dopey and shit like that, and it's like,  ah, you know, a little fucking messing around.  And then, like, we get, hey, I listened to your show when I was fucking in fifth grade,  and you're like, holy shit, you're a man.  Yeah.  Imagine, like, oh, oh, I fucking sexually abused you. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  And now, look, you're a man.  Well, I sent you the one picture, our old intern, Brian.  Yeah, Brian.  He was one of our first soldiers ever.  Oh, he was great.  We've had many soldiers since, but Brian interned for us through our AF years, or a chunk of  it.  And now he's a fucking man.  He's 30.  I would imagine he's like 32 years old now.  30.  He might be 33 years old.  Jesus.  We knew him as a teenage kid.  He came up with the name Rock Hole.  I think he was in high school.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Rock Hole.  I think he interned for us when he was in high school.  He's now in his 30s.  That dude you introduced me to up in Boston?  Yeah, nice kid.  How crazy is that?  And he's a talented kid.  He's a creative kid.  He was installing home entertainment systems.  He's out of fucking work.  Oh, really?  So if I tweet his Twitter account, someone get him a goddamn job.  Help us out, will you?  Yeah, get him a job.  He deserves it.  He's a good kid and works hard.  Wow.  Down on his luck. 
[01:04:00]  Then he films shit and stuff.  And he's 30.  He's 30.  He's got to be 32, 33 years old now.  He was a little kid.  Yeah.  How old is that 12-year-old kid that you were supposed to take to the hockey game?  That's AEW, so.  Yeah.  He's got to be.  He's probably playing for the Islanders.  In 23?  When did we get fired?  2002?  August of 2002.  So he was 12 before that, I guess.  Let's say 2001 he was 12. 
[01:04:30]  So yeah, got to add 12 years on.  Oh, Jesus.  He's 24.  He's 24.  He could have a kid older than my kid.  Of course.  Got started a little late.  Got started a little late in fatherhood.  A little late.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  These bones are creaking.  Little fuckers.  Chase those kids.  Oh.  I think you're supposed to have kids older now, man. 
[01:05:00]  Fucking.  People died when they were 40, but now we're looking at 70 or 80.  I don't mind it.  My career is behind me, so it's cool.  Then I'll just fucking raise kids without having to work.  I'm good with that.  This was going to lead to something.  Boston.  Getting older.  Menino, maybe.  We could do the Menino stuff.  Well, Menino.  Look at that.  It's going full circle.  Yeah, we were going to talk about the sports injury, too.  I want to see that video.  I have not seen it.  It's Kevin Ware.  I didn't know his name before yesterday. 
[01:05:30]  I'm not going to sit here in front.  I was watching Louisville-Duke, which is an amazing basketball game as far as the NCAA tournament goes.  It was a close game.  Then this kid fucking snapped his leg, and then Louisville rallied around that and kicked Duke's ass.  Yeah.  Louisville is the number one seed and all, but it was definitely a close game before the big injury.  That really is pretty terrible.  And CBS Sports chose not to show the replay, and a lot of the media outlets have chosen not to play it. 
[01:06:00]  We're fucking dicks.  Why?  I don't know, because everyone's going to the internet.  You're just telling people, well, go to the internet.  Yeah.  They're so fucking stupid, these TV people.  I don't know who they're protecting.  The children?  They're broadcasting manifestos of masked killers.  My son was in the room when it happened.  He didn't notice. 
[01:06:30]  We weren't going to explain it to him or anything, but he didn't notice.  So who are they protecting?  You're just telling everyone, go to the internet.  The internet is way cooler.  Right.  Well, it is.  Because there's a fascination.  People do want to check it out, as horrific as it was.  I guess he jumps up, right?  It's kind of a...  And then he comes back down onto the floor because of, you know, gravity.  Right.  And his leg just snaps.  Below his knee.  Why don't you go full screen on that? 
[01:07:00]  I thought it was a really bad knee injury at first.  Then you realize, holy fuck, that is the bones between his knee and his fucking ankle snapping in half.  And I guess the bone popped out of its leg about six inches.  And I guess so many people have seen this at this point.  All the players just freaking out, losing it right away.  And now there's reports that people on the bench, you see those guys on the bench?  It happened right in front of them.  A few of those guys actually did get sick.  You see this weird delay. 
[01:07:30]  He goes up.  He hits the ground.  His leg breaks.  Look at the stands.  I mean, the bench.  Right.  In the upper kind of left, all those players, they fucking lose their mind.  They lose their mind.  And, yeah.  All right, play it for Jimmy.  We'll have to play this a couple of times because it was far away, the camera angles.  That's why I don't think it's the worst televised sports injury because it is far enough away.  It's brutal.  You understand what's going on.  But I think that Joe Theismann was more of a close-up. 
[01:08:00]  But I do think they replayed it on CBS.  Well, they were saying in the paper today they chose not to.  So maybe they played it at first.  Not knowing how bad it was, maybe.  And then the rest of the game, they blew it off, I think.  I think this is a clip, too.  They played it in slow-mo.  All right.  Let's see.  All right.  Look at the bench.  Oh, they all freak out.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, that leg just fucking went.  I never saw the bench.  I didn't focus on the bench. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, the bench.  They're calling.  They lose their minds.  Yeah, because they're not even 10 feet away.  Oh, God damn it.  His foot is hanging.  That's a bad injury.  And then everybody's just losing their minds.  This guy gets his camera up real quick.  Oh, boy, this poor bastard.  And then you think these guys are hurt, but they're so distraught they just fell to the ground.  Oh, that's terrible.  They're shaken up because of how Bruceyman looks. 
[01:09:00]  They are just visibly...  Yeah, they did show the replay at first, but...  You saw it on the backside there, folks.  His leg came under him as he landed, and he...  Oh, that happened to me, Mike.  That don't hurt.  I'm looking into...  April Fool's.  Didn't happen to me.  I know that.  Look at the bench.  Look at the bench.  You're right, Ant.  They're falling down.  Yeah.  That guy fucking fainted.  He fucking fainted.  He fucking...  Go back a little step. 
[01:09:30]  Watch this.  Holy shit.  Guy just falls on the floor.  There's a guy right up in there.  He faints.  He stands up and he falls over.  Yeah, look at that.  He just fell down.  Wow.  Look at him.  They are just bombed.  They're crying.  Because I think they know his career is probably over.  That's like a career-ending injury.  Oh.  They already operated.  And they're starting to say that he probably has a good chance of coming back.  Oh, good.  In time for the final game, which is good.  So...  Yeah, in time for the final game.  Wow, they are good. 
[01:10:00]  What a tough fucking guy this guy is.  Walk it off.  Any man that's holding a bone in his leg can drink out of my canteen anytime.  What's wrong with that guy?  Look at his arms.  What was that?  That's more tragic than the leg injury.  Wow, this guy's clapping.  What is...  He's like got Tyrannosaurus arms.  What is that?  He just claps.  There's someone in the stands that's got really tiny arms. 
[01:10:30]  Wow, these guys are crying.  Yeah, Patino is balling too.  Look at the love on this team for their fallen teammate.  Well...  Pause.  What do you expect?  Pause.  How sad is that for you when you see...  When you see your fucking teammates weeping, that's a bad injury.  Oh, yeah.  You're looking at him and going, hey, is it that bad, guys?  Oh, boy.  Look at the love for him.  Are you kidding me?  Like, we hate half the people around here, but if one of these guys went down with an 
[01:11:00]  injury like that, I think we would turn into human beings.  Right?  That's terrible.  God damn.  His fucking leg bends like he has another knee.  They're brutal.  How does that...  Bone pops out six inches out of his body.  Out of his leg.  You could see the white bone sticking straight out.  That was so...  Especially because he's black.  The contrast was very obvious, even from across the floor.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you could see it.  It's jutting straight.  Look at... 
[01:11:30]  Oh, man.  Maybe that was the sock I'm thinking of.  Because I...  Oh, man.  They keep going.  It's hanging.  Fell to the floor.  Oh, he covered the bone sticking out.  The one guy covered the bone.  They're like, holy...  He's going to have nightmares, this motherfucker.  Wow.  I saw that shit.  The other team's like, holy shit.  He didn't even land funny.  He was going in a weird direction when he hit it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  He had a little forward momentum going with the height and everything.  Ah, now here's the thighs.  Here's the thighs moves.  Now, they were saying that that basketball one that we just saw is one of the worst sports...  No, they're trying to say it's the worst.  ...sports injury ever.  It's open for discussion, certainly.  But, first of all, maybe if you were there seeing it live.  Maybe if you were standing right in front of it and saw it.  Right.  But as far as what TV picked up and what the majority of the public saw, thighs have been so much worse.  You think?  Yes.  Let's see. 
[01:12:30]  With LT.  You just see that.  Don't forget.  LT's on him.  He's got it, and his leg is taking it, taking it, taking it, and pop!  And then just snaps.  That's what makes it so bad.  I haven't seen this in a while.  All right.  Oh, boy.  This is bad.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Over Carson.  Oh, and you see the right knee, the right foot.  Oh!  And then eight guys fell on it.  Lawrence Taylor leaped to his feet and beckoned over to the rest.  Oh!  I don't know, man. 
[01:13:00]  No, I think the basketball one's worse.  The basketball might be worse.  I think Theismann's probably worse.  I've seen both.  Because when you landed on it, immediately the pressure came off.  Theismann buckled under, and then fucking ate 200 pounds.  I think Theismann's worse.  Painful lies, yeah.  Even though I think the basketball one looks worse, but more guys fell on Joe.  Sam.  Dude, this one is bad.  But this isn't sports.  I said the Arwen Hart one tops all of it.  This is sports entertainment, Sam.  This one's bad.  We're targeting sports.  Who said?  Which one?  Well, don't tell me.  Let me see.  Let me see.  You'll probably be able to guess. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, God.  This is bad.  Set this up, Sam.  It's flopping all over.  He just jumps off.  But who's who?  Sid jumps off the top rope.  Everybody's seen this clip.  Sid's jumping off the top rope.  It's the same injury.  Who's he jumping into?  Scott Steiner, but I don't even think he hits him.  All right.  Ted Bishop's up on top.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  God damn, Sid. 
[01:14:00]  Once again, isolated.  Oh, God damn it!  That's worse.  Wow!  His superhero boot.  That is bad.  Obviously, kids.  The compound fracture of the...  Kids, you gotta drink your milk.  You have to drink your milk.  That's terrible.  That's the worst thing ever.  That one's fucking bad.  Did that end his career?  Or did he fight after that?  No, I mean, but it's easy to...  He...  He was never the same?  No.  Wow.  That is a bad visual right there. 
[01:14:30]  God damn it.  And I want to thank Jeff on Long Island, because yes, I think the Clint Malarchuk...  I think it's Chuck or...  Check?  Malarchuk, I believe.  Malarchy?  The throat fucking...  Injury is the worst ever.  That's a bad one, too.  He gets slashed across the throat, and he's bleeding out in front of everybody.  Didn't they charge you the guy with assault, too?  Or was that a total accident?  No, that was an accident.  Okay.  Who was the guy that fucking got the Islander puck in the face of?  Oh, that's Crosby.  Holy shit.  That was over the weekend, too.  That was brutal.  It looked like he got shot. 
[01:15:00]  Watch this.  I can't watch this.  I'm sorry we don't have a visual element.  They don't believe in it.  You're in serious action.  We could be showing this to the people, too, right?  They absolutely don't believe in it.  But the Joe Rogan podcast would have this all for them.  Of course they would, please.  And they're a podcast.  Because Joe does it himself.  That's terrible.  So the skate came up.  They knocked.  He's just fucking bleeding out in front of everybody.  A massive pool of blood immediately.  He's holding his.  Look, it's just shooting out.  His throat is fucking.  He's fucked.  Did that end his career or no? 
[01:15:30]  I don't know, to be honest with you.  He probably came back in the fucking third quarter.  Tough fucking hockey players.  Or period.  Yeah, no, quarter.  It was different.  Because the back then.  Sorry.  I don't mean to correct it.  Oh, that's terrible.  So wait.  The guy's skate just hit him by accident, right?  Oh, yeah.  That was a complete accident.  But he was bleeding out in front of everybody.  And it's classic.  The puddle again.  God damn.  And he skates off.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  The stretcher.  They held his fucking throat together.  And they saved his life.  But look at the amount of blood instantly. 
[01:16:00]  The blood was crazy.  Now, you don't see the injury.  So, but.  You see the aftermath.  And it's not pretty.  Fucking sports, man.  Jesus.  That's a weird one.  What's that?  The photo of the bone sticking out of the leg.  Where'd you get it?  Oh, shit.  Is that it?  Let me see.  That's it.  I don't know if I want to see it.  It's a high-res picture.  It's just under his kneecap, it looks like.  Jesus, is that real?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Let's see.  Fuck.  Blow it up. 
[01:16:30]  Holy fuck.  Doesn't even look like a real fucking.  It looks photoshopped.  I know.  Wow, that is a fucking.  Wow, that's terrible.  That's brutal.  Yikes.  Oh my god, dude.  I can't look at that.  Ow.  I'm pretty good at looking at this.  Shit.  Kenny, you can't look at it, right?  Kenny can't look at this.  Kenny doesn't want to look?  No, you can't look at it.  Yeah, if I caused enough of these.  Yeah, unless the ones I've inflicted.  Wow, that might be the worst.  That's pretty bad.  Now that I've seen that.  Wow.  Yeah, that's pretty bad. 
[01:17:00]  Holy fuck.  How do you come back from that?  I would fucking tape it right back up and come play again.  It happened to me once while I was playing b-ball.  Did it?  No, I'm just April Fooling you again.  Fucking undefeated.  Airport evacuated.  Suspicious item at Detroit Metropolitan.  April Fool's.  Oh, maybe it is?  No.  Oh, is it now?  I think you had performed me.  Oh, no, it wasn't.  Suspicious item at Detroit Metropolitan.  Yeah.  An employed citizen. 
[01:17:30]  Is that it?  Yeah, I was trying to think of something.  Whoa.  Oh, wow.  They're fucking not happy.  Oh, God.  Everyone's leaving the airport.  That would suck.  Worst audible injury is Bobby's when he hurt his knee.  Yeah, absolutely.  And then someone is saying the Robin Ventura injury.  What was that one again?  Does anyone remember?  Uh-uh.  Why was that one a bad one?  No.  But yeah, Corey Hill, the guy on Twitter, said UFC leg break was bad. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, that was a bad one.  Yes.  I remember that one.  Yep.  Yep.  Yee.  Maybe yesterday.  Kevin Ware.  We know his name now.  They're all bad.  That might be the worst one.  Imagine in the old days, though, dude, back in fucking like the 1820s,  when you had a compound fracture, old Doc Barnegat would come over  and just wash it off and sew you back up, and then you'd die of an infection.  Sawbones.  That's why they call them a sawbones.  They would fucking hack that right off.  Yeah, they would.  They would go to medical school back then just so they could saw your leg off. 
[01:18:30]  Saw your fucking leg right off.  Let me ask you.  Wait.  This guy wants to talk about the Robin Ventura injury.  Hold on one sec, because I don't remember this one of you.  John in New York.  What's up, John?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Robin Ventura slid into home plate and ankles spun,  and it's put his face again when he gets up.  You got to see.  I think it was in early 2000.  He played for the Chicago White Sox.  So check that one out, dude. 
[01:19:00]  It's pretty brutal, because that's really close up.  All right.  We'll take a look at that.  Why don't I remember this one?  I don't either.  We have a guy that had the same injury happen to him.  Which one?  On the line here.  On the leg break?  Yeah.  Tom in Staten Island.  Hey, guys.  So you had that leg injury that we all saw last night?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I got hit by a jet ski.  The nose of a jet ski hit my leg on the side and just cracked both bones. 
[01:19:30]  They popped out of the skin, and I was in the water when it happened.  I lifted my leg.  I lifted my leg out of the water, and my knee came above the water.  The rest of my leg floated on the water.  Oh, my God.  I watched my brother and my brother-in-law look at me in panic, and it's weird.  Did you notice he was calm, and everybody else around him was kind of crying?  It's like it's so weird comes over to you, and you're like, okay, I need to take control. 
[01:20:00]  And I told them to get me on the boat.  I told them to elevate my leg and put pressure on it.  And the whole time, I'm in pain, but it was weird.  It was like an out-of-body experience almost, and it was nasty.  By the way, I'm hearing that this Twitter picture is fake.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Fake, fake, totally fake.  So were you able to come back and compete in your sport?  Oh, yeah.  I'm super competitive. 
[01:20:30]  No, I was able to get back to work.  I had some complications, but I was able to get back to work.  This guy will probably get back in about three or four months once the bone is somewhat healed  and in about a year, he'll probably be able to play again.  Oh, okay, doctor.  Do you feel – do you feel – hold on, hold on, hold on.  Does your leg feel pretty normal at this point?  Yeah, I mean, I have some dead spots, like on the skin, like if you touch certain spots  on the skin, but otherwise it feels normal. 
[01:21:00]  I still have the rod in it, too.  Oh, rod.  Yeah, and my injury was kind of – it was worse because I took a blunt trauma on – like,  it was 20-mile-an-hour chest, he hit my leg, so I lost – I lost muscle, too.  This guy probably isn't going to lose muscle.  He probably just – you know, the bones just snap, so it's healing time.  What if his bone broken away where it's all splintery?  How the fuck do they fix that shit?  It's amazing.  They use pins.  It's called a compound fracture.  Oh, wow.  Jim C.  What happens is he fell out.  He put the wrong pressure. 
[01:21:30]  The bone came to the leg.  And it's going to get septic shock unless we treat him.  Oh, wow.  It's going to cause death.  Abigail.  How come you – but you're a coroner.  How do you know about, you know –  I've seen plenty of these injuries.  Were you hoping –  Sam, wash it off.  He's hoping that would lead to his death.  Yeah.  I've seen this injury time and time again on these athletes, the way they're exploited.  I was looking for a fucking – for Joe Forrester clips all weekend. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, you didn't find them?  No.  Boy, that's a show that just –  I watched the first one on Netflix.  You can watch it on Netflix.  No, you can't.  It's April Fool's.  I looked.  I looked everywhere.  You're not enjoying the April Fool's joke today?  I hate April Fool's.  Is this only the second one we've done live or maybe the third?  Yeah, it always worked out where we weren't on.  And for a few years, they wouldn't let us do one. 
[01:22:30]  Right, right.  They actually gave us a free day off.  Yeah.  They didn't charge us for it.  They just said, John, just take the day.  We don't trust you.  You got the Robin Venture?  Yes, Edgar.  You have pudding in your computer.  I have – Edgar's saying, I have pudding in my computer.  Really?  Oh, dear.  Oh, my.  That will –  Pull-fell-less.  Pull-fell-less.  Jesus. 
[01:23:00]  I think it's –  Somebody on Twitter said it's Jason Kendall, not Robin Ventura.  Why do they keep saying Robin Ventura?  I don't know.  It says on his wiki that Robin Ventura retired because he had arthritis in his ankle.  Well, maybe he snapped that shit.  Maybe from that right.  Maybe that caused it.  Oh.  I don't know.  He's arthritic.  It is opening day today, huh?  Yes.  New York's going to have a rough baseball year.  Mets and Yankees open today.  Mets and Yankees are probably going to have pretty bad years.  Yeah, that's what everybody's saying.  It doesn't look good.  Don't look good, right? 
[01:23:30]  A lot of injuries.  A lot of injuries.  You're going, huh?  Yeah, opening day.  Why not?  Yankee Stadium.  That sounds great.  Yeah, it's supposed to be nice weather.  The, uh, yeah.  Get some legend seats.  Get some fucking dinner or lunch at the fucking, uh, little restaurant-y.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They know how to serve food properly.  Oh, yeah.  A couple of beers.  Nice.  And, uh, the game.  That'll be good.  Hells yeah.  Very, very good. 
[01:24:00]  And then, uh, I guess, um, I guess Bobo is, uh, going to the Met game, uh, opener.  Yeah.  At Citi Field because, uh, he had a great idea.  Um, he wants to get as many people as he can to, uh, tweet a picture with him.  What do you mean?  I guess he's going to be there.  Right.  He wants people.  Right.  To take pictures with him and tweet it.  But how are they going to know it's him?  Oh, because he's Bobo.  You have to know Bobo.  My name's on the billboard. 
[01:24:30]  I walk around every day.  No one knows who I am.  Exactly.  How are they going to know him?  Exactly.  How the fuck are they going to know him?  But then he threw the gauntlet out, the challenge to the people.  He goes, and do the same with Anthony, and we'll see who could get the most pictures tweet.  I'm like, really?  You think that's how I want to spend the fucking game?  He's begging, I guess, us to follow him or something.  I am so close to just blocking him.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm not following you.  I'm so close to just blocking you.  Is he still talking to that girl, Katie?  He just...  No, I think that's over. 
[01:25:00]  He was heartbroken.  By the way, let's check out how are his viral videos doing.  I predicted these hunks of shit wouldn't bring 6,000 views.  Oh, no.  I think they're doing better than that.  What?  Yep.  No way.  Yep.  Bobo's...  Is Mr. Maloon again?  They're not going viral.  No new ones?  Why would they be?  Wow.  Well, one's over 11,000 and the other is 16?  Is that 16?  18,000.  I'm telling you.  It's probably just him over and over.  That's decent numbers. 
[01:25:30]  If I was checking my numbers and I saw that on some of my videos, I'd be happy.  Reep.  You want to know what a viral video is?  Fucking Chip Ruins the Mood.  Apparently it was on Reddit this week, which I didn't know.  And it's at almost a half a million views.  Was it?  Which one?  Chip Ruins the Mood?  The Canva?  No.  Yeah.  Look it up.  April Fools.  No.  This is real.  One's got 440-something thousand and one's got 46,000.  Yeah.  Half a million.  Half a mil.  Let me see.  Is that mine? 
[01:26:00]  Wow.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That's 503,000.  That's from Reddit.  That's not bad.  What was it at last?  I mean, I don't read it.  I don't even remember.  That's 50,000.  I know WorldStarHipHop put it on there.  Put it on the map.  Dude, since a couple days ago when I looked, somebody Twittered me, I'm like,  why would this be on Reddit?  Yeah.  That's what happened.  It's got like 50,000 more views.  They just pop up here and there.  Yeah.  Chip Ruins the Mood.  I didn't, though.  That was a good moment.  I know.  It ruined the mood.  That was a great video.  That was funny.  Could you play it?  It's quick.  I just got to hear his voice again.  Oh, fucking goodness. 
[01:26:30]  Well, you got to set it up.  Hold on.  Pause.  You got to set it up, man.  There's people out there that still haven't heard this.  Yeah.  We were driving.  Where the fuck was this?  Was it Cleveland?  Cleveland?  I think it was Cleveland.  It was Cleveland.  It was Cleveland.  It was Cleveland.  It was going from the airport to the hotel.  And the driver, who doesn't know you guys at all.  No, the driver, he wouldn't shut up.  He was just yapping about everything, making conversations.  So I just started recording it and laughing at everything he said, having a good time, 
[01:27:00]  over-the-top laughter of what this guy is saying because it's not funny.  And he thought you were really laughing.  Yeah, and in the middle of the laughter, Chip decides to throw in his own little...  And Kenny's there, too?  Yeah.  Club soda?  Yeah.  I have my wife convinced that I'm deaf, but I never listen to anything she says.  That's funny, Bob.  I have my wife convinced that I'm her husband.  I've never been married, but if I... 
[01:27:30]  How's that going for you?  Not good.  No, wait, wait.  She probably wants you to do all the work around the house.  I was going to get married once, but I couldn't because she was sick with cancer.  See that?  Chip, that's not funny.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Just completely took the energy out of the car.  Completely fucking killed it. 
[01:28:00]  Holy fuck.  Oh, is that funny?  See that?  I really made that party worthwhile.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  And I like...  I went and put the camera on Kenny for a second.  He's just looking out the window.  Yeah, even he was...  Yeah.  Nothing bothers Kenny.  The best part of that is watching it and you just see Jimmy or Chippa.  He's sitting there going, wait, wait, wait.  Like he wants to get it in.  He wants to get the line in, but other people are talking.  But he doesn't want the subject to change, so he just keeps going, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Holy fuck. 
[01:28:30]  That's a good one.  Absolutely.  Fucking good laugh, right?  Good laugh, indeed.  I know what the fuck I'm doing.  Somebody sent me a photo as to why Nicolas Cage might have said no to Jim.  Oh, shit.  Some of the wackiest celebrity pictures from 2012.  And one is, I guess, Nick Cage on a plane with...  A beast.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a fucking beast.  Beastly woman sitting next to him and his eyes are shut. 
[01:29:00]  That fat cunt cost me a picture.  Yes.  Yes.  That's pretty funny.  Oh, wow.  That's a bad one.  I guess this is a horrible picture of him.  That is terrible.  Well, they're red-eye flights.  That's why I didn't get my Pesci.  But he was wearing a hat, man.  He looked great.  And he had the fucking designer Hollywood-type glasses on.  Fuck, man.  I got a picture with Pesci.  I know.  I already got one.  Oh.  Damn it.  I have a Nicolas Cage.  I'll get that.  Do you?  Oh, right.  When he was here. 
[01:29:30]  We do have Nicolas Cage pictures.  I got Nicolas Cage.  Who else made this list of wackiest celebrity pictures from 2012?  I'm going to see a few more of these.  Oh?  Oh, boy.  Pop-ups.  I just edited a really mean one out.  What do you mean?  What?  I just didn't.  I don't feel good about saying it.  You just tweeted something?  No.  I was just going to say something that was just mean and not even that funny.  That's what this show is based on. 
[01:30:00]  I know.  Can't you just say it now?  No, I don't want to.  Can't you acknowledge that it's just mean and no?  Let's say he's writing.  No, I'm not afraid to say it.  I just don't want to.  Yeah.  All right.  It's just, there's really very little humor value there.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah, that is bad.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Where's the pictures?  They're hard to find.  They really are.  Where the fuck are the ones up? 
[01:30:30]  The websites are terrible.  There's so many pop-ups and shit on it.  Who cares?  That rumor is good.  No, they're just...  We don't have to go through them after all.  Oh, is that a good guy?  No, that's Kesha.  Oh, Kesha.  Yeah, she's got fucked up tooth.  She purposely has no tooth there?  Oh.  Yeah, it looks like a silver tooth.  Is that just being cool?  Yeah, it's just a cap.  I got a plastic one in right now.  It's annoying as fuck.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah.  That crown situation.  Yeah.  You got a temporary in.  Wah! 
[01:31:00]  I used to have a dentist that you'd watch your tooth being formed right in front of your eyes  with that computer laser shit.  Yeah.  Amazing.  But he's old school.  He sends it out.  You got to wait two weeks.  Oh, man.  Mm-hmm.  Who's that?  Demi Moore with Lenny Kravitz.  Oh, God.  She's sexy.  Look at them fucking legs.  I like to lick her thighs.  Ugh.  Dirty girl.  I can lick those dirty girl thighs.  Filthy.  Yeah, this is a dumb bitch.  Yeah, they're just fucked.  Whatever.  Stupid pictures.  But no one can look around along with us.  No, of course not. 
[01:31:30]  No, they don't believe in the visual element.  Even though every podcast is fucking jumping on board with that shit.  Oh, yeah.  Embarrassing.  Mm-hmm.  When we get back, we got Mayor Menino audio.  He's stepping down.  And we'll certainly figure out some other shit, too.  Mayor Menino.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  This is the OPNT Channel.  What's Sirius XM?  Down. 
[01:32:00]  You're way down.  Keep going.  He's got a movement before he had the ball.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  All right.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow. 
[01:32:30]  Hold my hand, man.  Ow.  I'm going to squeeze something.  Ow.  On the side.  On the side.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I broke my knee, man.  Shit.  It bent backwards.  Did it hyperextend?  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I broke my knee, man.  Oh my god.  It bent backwards.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Ah. 
[01:33:00]  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Hold my hand, man.  I'm going to squeeze something.  Anybody have some, like, Advil?  Oh, motherfucker.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, you motherfucker.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Ah, it's fucked up.  Ah, you mother.  Ah.  Ah, what the fuck?  Hold my hand, man.  I got a squeeze up.  Dude, I won't move.  Hold my hand, man.  I got a squeeze up.  I broke that fucking thing. 
[01:34:00]  I broke it.  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg.  I broke it.  I broke it, dude.  I felt it crack.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Oh, my God.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Hold my hand, man. 
[01:34:30]  I got a squeeze up.  I broke my leg, man.  I got a squeeze up.  I'm in so much pain, dude.  I'm in so much pain.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  It's Marvin Gaye Day. 
[01:35:00]  Marvin Gaye.  Killed by his father 29 years ago today at the age of 44.  That was 30 years ago?  Jesus.  Wow.  We said that before, I think.  Crazy.  Crazy.  Yeah, 29 years ago.  Hey, um...  We just played the Bob Kelly thing.  I just want to say it quickly.  As much as we've made fun of that clip for years at this point, can you imagine the pain 
[01:35:30]  you've got to be in to ask another man to hold your hand?  Oh, yeah.  That's war shit.  To really just break it down.  It's war shit.  It's like when a soldier gets shot.  Yeah.  And the medic's going, stay with me.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand, man.  Like, that's what he was doing.  Yeah.  What were you going to say?  We were talking about Amtrak and their horrible food earlier.  Horrendous.  There's an article here about how they lose, let's say, food and beverage cars have lost 
[01:36:00]  $833 million over the last decade, including $84.5 million in 2011.  What are you talking about?  They've lost money.  And here's one of their...  No, Amtrak or just the food part of Amtrak.  That's impossible.  That's just from the food.  That's all you need to know about the fucking government.  Exactly.  And here's a good point.  Wait, what's that number again?  $837 million?  833.  $33 and $85 million in the last year, you said? 
[01:36:30]  $84.5 million in 2011.  The reason, the difference between Amtrak's cost and what they charge.  That's pretty much it.  Here's the cost for each cheeseburger that they serve.  It costs the American taxpayer $16.15 per cheeseburger.  What are you talking about?  And they're selling it for $9.50.  What a fucking terrible... 
[01:37:00]  Wait, what?  Exactly.  What?  To serve that cheeseburger...  Right.  ...to you on that train...  ...cost them $16.15.  $16.00?  When they break down all the overhead?  That's the American government paying.  That's how they pay.  That's why I don't want to give them any more money until they figure out how to spend the  money properly that they already have.  Dick.  The government sucks dick.  They really do.  They're just fucking terrible.  They charge $2 for a can of soda. 
[01:37:30]  The can of soda costs them $3.40.  There's just no reason...  So why does the government go, all right, we got to figure this out.  We got to get our fucking soda cheaper.  Does that mean people will lose jobs or something?  Probably.  The union people, the...  The government is notorious for just spending too much money for shit and not seeming to  give a shit.  They'll just tax you more.  Yeah, then they'll just ignore the fact that they know.  They know stuff is way too expensive.  Right. 
[01:38:00]  I mean, like you said, you know, OTB going out of business is all you need to know about  how the government handles our money.  The state was running a fucking off-track betting where you bet on the horses, the horse  races, and they were losing money.  That's impossible.  It's impossible.  It's pretty much impossible.  Fuck.  But to pay $16 for a cheeseburger and then to sell it for like $9?  And they're losing $85 million a year on really shitty food. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Shitty food.  It's extremely shitty food.  And a lot of people are pissed because they're like, you know, obviously if we want a rail  system, the taxpayers should pay for Amtrak.  It should be run better and whatnot.  So why can't they just go, no more food?  And here's a snack bar.  That's what they were saying.  But how much does a snack bar cost to government?  I don't know.  How about they fire the cocksucking idiots who have been losing the money?  Yeah.  And they run it like a business.  They say they don't want to run a fucking money-losing concession stand on a fucking train. 
[01:39:00]  And the government funded.  We went to the website.  They show all the chefs that are involved with making the really bad shitty food.  You know how much they make.  And you know how much like the contract for the fucking burgers.  A government contract.  Like they're just paying so much fucking money.  That's where I'm at with taxes and all that.  As soon as they figure out how to spend the money they got properly.  Yeah.  Then all right.  Show me the fucking books and I'll go, oh, I understand.  Okay.  I got to pay a little more now.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I don't want to give money to a bunch of people who lose almost a billion dollars on train food. 
[01:39:30]  Those cunts.  On horrid train food.  85 million last year.  A year for 10 years.  Basically.  Yeah.  That's what it's coming out to.  You're right.  It's 850 million over 10 years.  Okay.  So you're right.  Averaging 85 million a year.  They're losing.  They're losing.  But we're not doing our fair share.  Pay more.  We'll give 100 million to Syria or 100 million to Egypt.  Yes.  And then we'll lose a billion in 10 years here.  But keep paying.  And people wonder why you're against giving more money to them. 
[01:40:00]  That's why.  They're incompetent.  And when I'm on a train, because you know, if they said here's a bowl of cereal, I'd be fine.  It's a shit.  They're not going to lose my business.  I guess they feel like they're going to lose a lot of business if they don't serve food.  I'd love to know what that Amtrak signature steak cost.  Oh, God.  If a burger's 16 bucks, that signature steak must really cost a bundle.  They figure they better put signature in the title because they know how much they're paying  for that steak.  Signature steak. 
[01:40:30]  That's unbelievable.  Amtrak.  Shut up.  Hate it.  Speaking of wasting money, I got to say the Cowboys and Jimmy's favorite fucking team.  It's a great move.  Jimmy's not a Tony Romo fan, so he can't be happy that he just signed a six-year, $108 million  contract extension.  The bottom line, he's a bum, and he's a pretty decent regular season guy.  He's got the skills.  But he's a choke.  He's got the fundamentals, as they like to say, but he doesn't have the heart of a champion. 
[01:41:00]  No, he doesn't.  He'll never win big games.  He says, same fucking thing.  He's a choke.  My team and your team, very similar with their quarterback situation.  Yep.  He is a choke.  Although Romo's a better quarterback, but I mean, they both have those solid fundamentals,  but they fucking don't have that heart in the end.  They think they do, but they don't.  But he's going to make another $108 million with his extension over six years.  They can't admit they made a mistake.  That is a lot of money.  I'm amazed by what you just read there.  That's fucked up. 
[01:41:30]  Dude, it's just, but that's every aspect of the government.  That's everything they do.  It costs a fuckload.  They never know how to bring the cost down, and then they just ask you for more money.  Right.  Like, why would you want to bring the cost down?  Why does it come out when you could just, you have an unlimited till of revenue you can  always dip from?  Because it's not their money.  No.  They don't give a fuck.  Just keep taking more.  I don't want to pay $16 for a fucking burger to sell it at a loss. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, that's a horrible business.  Horrible.  There's no business that would survive that.  So why does the government get to survive those horrible business moves?  Just keep milking us.  I mean, my brother owns a restaurant.  I understand the restaurant world a little bit because of him.  Could you imagine if he was selling?  Holy fuck, we would be open for a week.  Selling everything for $2, $3 cheaper than it was costing him?  Especially that garbage food that they serve. 
[01:42:30]  It's fucking garbage.  It costs the government $16 for the burger, and they can only sell it for $9 because they  know after that no one's going to fucking pay.  Right.  So they go into it knowing they're going to lose $7 every time someone orders a burger.  With overhead.  What kind of overhead is there for burgers?  What the fuck?  The government is absolutely fucking terrible.  And they know they're losing $85 million a year, and they still just go, ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't fucking get it. 
[01:43:00]  We're lost.  This nation is lost, man.  I'm telling you.  The whole country is fucking lost.  Fuck it.  It's run by a bunch of cunts who have zero accountability because everything gets, it's  like middle management here.  Everything gets washed away.  Like, who said that?  You know, upstairs.  There's never a person you can look at and go, yes, I said that, and yes, it was my  mistake.  No more of the buck stops here kind of thinking.  No.  Not at all.  And Amtrak is thinking of cutting two more lines.  How about just cut the food? 
[01:43:30]  Cut that food out.  Now you're cutting service because the burgers are costing too much.  Yeah.  What do you think?  People aren't going to take the train because they're missing out on that fine cuisine?  And then you get on a train.  Don't give a shit.  And it's packed, so that means we're doing our job.  Meaning we're customers, you know, paying for the service.  So how the fuck can't you figure out how to make this profitable?  Right.  Not only is it not profitable, they're losing.  Running at a loss.  A major loss.  That's just on the food part of it. 
[01:44:00]  Just the food.  Losing $85 million a year.  The government can't run businesses.  That's why when they start talking about, you know, the government running things, health  care for one, things like that.  You got to just say, really?  Really?  Is that fucking, is that going to work well?  They've never proven themselves to be able to run anything.  Right.  Without losing money. 
[01:44:30]  Amazing.  Well, that moves us into Mayor Menino.  I was up in Boston for Jimmy's taping.  We talked about it earlier in the show, and I was in my hotel room just chilling, and  they had the press conference on.  Should turn the eat up.  Live up there.  What?  Where were we?  That was a pretty nice hotel.  I should give them a plug, because we're always bitching about people.  The Charles Hotel.  The Charles Hotel in Harvard Square was nice.  The Charles.  Nice little place, man.  Yes.  A couple restaurants to choose from.  Cool little loungy bar area. 
[01:45:00]  I liked it.  I definitely liked it.  I would go back and stay there again.  But Menino was saying goodbye, basically, and I'm sitting there going, man, this is  fucking sad.  Was it sad?  Of course, I tweet that, and of course, people have to attack me for that, too.  Getting soft since you became a father.  Is that what they're saying?  What happened to the destroyer?  What happened?  He fucked you over.  God forbid you show a human emotion on the live show, on Twitter. 
[01:45:30]  God forbid you actually do that.  It was sad.  Don't ever.  And then the guy walks out with his fucking cane.  Did he have a hurry cane?  Yeah, a little cane.  You know, because you know he's in a room full of people that actually love him.  I'm not, you know, I know that Boston's pretty corrupt, and I know a lot of people don't  like Mayor Menino and think he's an asshole and all that, but I just looked at it as a  human thing.  Right, right, right.  That's kind of sad.  Yeah.  Let me see. 
[01:46:00]  I don't know how I'm going to feel about this.  Should we play it from there, or are the clips there, Sam?  Either way.  All right, let's watch the video then a little bit.  Let's see him, yeah.  Is he mumbling pretty good?  Yeah.  Would you make it big?  He looks thinner, though.  Well, he's sick.  I think he is.  I mean, he's sick.  He's not going to be around.  Oh, boy.  Something major is up.  Is this an April Fool's joke you're saying?  Wow.  Yeah.  Maybe I shouldn't say that today.  Oh, boy.  It is weird that I was up there the day he's saying I'm not going to be the mayor anymore  because we've been connected to this guy for 15 years. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  Look at him with a cane.  He's got his cane as he goes to the podium.  Did they rent that podium from that company?  For the past few months, I've been weighing in my own place in Boston's great future.  Pause.  Oh, weighing.  Oh, my God.  But he said me.  I didn't understand what he said. 
[01:47:00]  Can we go back?  I've been weighing in my own place in Boston's great future.  I was just kidding.  This is hilarious.  It is.  I've been blessed to regain so much of my health.  My physical therapy is going great.  That's where I should be right now, but I'm here.  I feel better today than I have in a long, long while. 
[01:47:30]  I feel better today.  All right.  I'm back to a mayor's schedule, but not a Bonino schedule.  And I miss that.  I miss it in every event, ribbon cutting, new homeowner's dinner, school play, and chance meetings. 
[01:48:00]  Spending so much time in the neighborhoods gives me energy.  Being with our residents builds our trust.  If you didn't know beforehand, if you were just watching this, you would be like, this poor gentleman had a stroke.  Right.  And he's coming back.  And this is very courageous and brave.  Right.  And then you realize, no, he's always spoken.  Mayor Campos.  He's fucking terrible.  He's the worst speaker ever.  He really talks badly. 
[01:48:30]  Oh.  I'm right here, guys.  Please.  Oh.  Please.  Yes, Tom.  Continue.  It may not be the only way to leave Boston, but it's the only way for me.  So, I'm here with the people I love.  To tell the city I love that I will leave the job that I love.  He's supposed to clap that? 
[01:49:00]  Yay, he's leaving.  I don't think he's supposed to clap that.  Yay, he's leaving.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  I will be very proud if I changed our city in some way that lasts.  I know from community leaders, business executives, nonprofit champions, and teachers of all types,  there are more ways to impact our city than just this one.  So, I do plan to stay very engaged in Boston's future. 
[01:49:30]  Yay.  How's that?  He's just a humorless idiot when it comes to certain other things.  He's probably a good guy, but...  Yeah.  Like, when that fucking...  Remember that video game thing he called the Terror Squad?  Because they were doing that fucking, like, cartoon channel promo.  He's an idiot.  He was the only city that believed it.  The Terror Squad.  The Terror Squad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  I am not retiring, but just churning one page on this chapter.  Churning.  Churning.  Churning.  Churning.  Churning.  To build a seat.  I just ask that you choose someone who loves this city as much as I do. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  What's he eating clam chowder or something?  Fucking...  One of the great lessons of this...  You hear my fucking job?  Yeah, I heard it.  ...job was meeting half the people who live in this city.  I get asked all the time.  What are you saying?  How I met.  Yeah, who are you?  So much of Boston.  I just did what I loved.  Then it wasn't too hard. 
[01:51:00]  All you do is start in Rosnil.  And rebuild its main streets with neighbors.  You walk...  Which one's his wife on his right?  I don't know.  I can't figure it out.  You walk with the proud residents of Bowdoin, Geneva.  Every Christmas Eve.  As they survey their progress.  Keep walking.  Until the job is done. 
[01:51:30]  You promise the people of Grove Hall.  A supermarket and a shopping mall.  And you deliver.  You say in West Roxbury that a landfill will become a park.  Then you return for soccer games.  For a soccer game.  Shuffle dirt in Dudley Square.  To move what seems like mountains.  Mountains.  What are mountains?  Mountains.  Literally, I gotta play that again.  What the fuck is he saying?  What?  Mountained.  He really is a fucking babbling buffoon. 
[01:52:00]  Keep walking.  Until the job is done.  You promise the people of Grove Hall.  A supermarket and a shopping mall.  And you deliver.  You say in West Roxbury that a landfill will become a park.  Then you return for soccer games.  You shovel dirt in Dudley Square.  To move what seems like mountains. 
[01:52:30]  Like mountains.  Every quote he's doing here is wrong.  He's trying for dramatic quotes.  Yeah.  Mountained.  Yeah.  A soccer games.  A soccer games.  A soccer games.  Yeah.  I've been to the mountain middle.  You're a fool, sir.  Shovel dirt in Dudley.  I've shoveled Dudley in dirt.  He would really fuck up famous quotes.  Oh, Jesus.  From history, man.  That's not what your cunt can do. 
[01:53:00]  No.  One small step for a moon.  Two big jumps for a hopscotch.  Boo.  It would be one small steps.  Yeah.  One small steps.  One small steps.  For the man.  For the man.  For the man.  One giant leap for mankind.  I've not yet begun to fire light.  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down those walls. 
[01:53:30]  That's walls is.  Walls is right.  Wow.  That's a good one.  The walls is wonderful.  What?  You got one?  Four squares and seven yards ago.  Yards.  And seven yards ago.  Four squares.  That's a good one.  Like mountains.  To build Boston's waterfront. 
[01:54:00]  New generation.  To collaborate.  Because that's what truly meeting people is.  What?  What did he just say there?  I don't know.  That whole statement was fucked up.  I think he picks words from different sentences.  What the fuck?  But in his mind, I bet you this comes out like he's eloquent, right?  Amazing.  I think he's dyslexic, personally.  He has to be.  No.  But you think like he walks away from speeches?  Like another homerun, Tommy.  He's speaking perfectly.  Absolutely. 
[01:54:30]  In Dudley Square.  To move what seems like mountains.  To build Boston's waterfront.  New generation.  To collaborate.  Because that's what truly meeting people is.  What?  I don't even know what he was trying to say there.  To build Boston's waterfront.  To collaborate.  Because that's what truly meeting people is.  It's a bunch of different thoughts.  He's cutting and pasting thoughts from his brain.  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.  Was he trying to say meaningful?  I don't know. 
[01:55:00]  I don't know that one.  Usually we can figure it out.  I bet when he's reading a speech off the prompter, at times he gets cocky.  Like, I'll just skim it.  And I'll put it in my own words.  And that's when he starts just throwing thoughts together.  I'm going to go off-cook here.  You promise a computer for every classroom.  Then watch kids teach their grandmothers.  No, it's not the grandfathers.  Out of email.  You partner with parents to keep politics out of the school committee. 
[01:55:30]  Sure.  Then you work with them to deliver quality schools closer to their homes.  Quality schools.  You work with them to deliver quality schools.  Quality schools closer to their homes.  That's great. 
[01:56:00]  You read to children at dazzling new libraries.  What?  Wait, why?  I hate to keep stopping, but fuck.  No, I love it.  Dazzling new libraries.  What did he say?  I believe the quote was,  You reach your children and dazzling new libraries.  All right, let's hear this.  You reach your children and dazzling new libraries.  And Mattapan and Brighton. 
[01:56:30]  Peter Pan and a pan crying.  You open your arms to all new Bostonians.  Then stand with them.  Bostonians?  He did.  He said Washington.  I heard Washington.  Washingtonians.  Say Waston.  All new Bostonians.  Yeah, it's Washington.  Washingtonians.  I am the luckiest man on the face of the earth.  You open your arms to all new Bostonians. 
[01:57:00]  Then stand with them.  As they become citizens.  Then you cut a ribbon.  And the small businesses they started.  Everything he's saying, he's just petering out.  He's unraveling.  By new citizens.  Then you cut a fart.  And a ribbon.  You don't mention ribbon cutting.  Ribbon cutting.  That's such a fucking figurehead dude.  And you just gowned over to the key to the slidding. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  It makes it seem like it's a really important thing.  A ribbon cutting.  Yeah.  That just started his speech.  Energy is starting to wear off.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was like, oh, no.  Words, words, words.  But by the end, he'll lift it again.  So in closing.  I won't be the man.  What?  He needs an applause break every 20 seconds.  Oh, yeah.  To get that energy up.  I'm killing, right?  People bouncing.  When the children graduate at the top of their class, you have them for lunch. 
[01:58:00]  Have them for lunch.  Have them for lunch.  I like this guy.  No, I don't think he meant have the children for lunch.  You gobble them up.  When they graduate at the top of their class, you have them for lunch.  What?  That's what you do.  That's terrifying for a kid.  Right.  Why would you do well in school?  Put mint jelly on their privates.  Oh, jeez.  I remember when Hartzell and Gretel came to the house one day.  I wanted to have them for lunch. 
[01:58:30]  Remember, kids, if you do well in school, the mayor will eat you.  He'll eat you.  As they become citizens, then you cut a ribbon on the small businesses that they started.  And then, when the children graduate at the top of their class, you have them for lunch and marvel at how fast they rise up in a city that welcomes them all.  Right.  Right. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  What?  We'll eat all of you.  We'll eat all of the children and students in Boffinston.  If they graduate at the top of their class, we will devour them.  It definitely should have been said differently.  Of course.  You don't say it that way because it sounds like if they graduate at the top of their class, the mayor will eat you.  The class.  You take them for lunch.  Right.  You take them for lunch. 
[01:59:30]  You join them for lunch.  You join them for lunch.  You don't eat them or have them for lunch.  Yeah.  I'm having a peanut butter sandwich for lunch.  Yeah.  I'm having a student.  I'll have mine medium rare.  I'm having the vowel of Aquarium for lunch.  Maybe that's why this made me sad because I know we're not going to get to do this too much longer.  I know.  That is because he's just a classic.  This is just classic.  It is tough. 
[02:00:00]  And I love how the whole room has to make believe that he's not talking shitty.  No, they just fucking applaud like he's Kennedy.  Yeah, they're not whispering to each other.  It's amazing.  Did he just say he's going to eat kids?  I think he's eating the children.  Right.  He's eating the children.  And boy, if you're kind of an old guy and you wear fat and then you lose some weight and you put that suit on,  that fucking shit that happens right above the tie, you know, like old people keep wearing suits.  Squishy skin pops out. 
[02:00:30]  It's like trying to neatly fold that fitted sheet.  You just can't do it.  Still sticking out of the top all wrinkly.  Make it all loose.  Yeah, loosen that up.  Loosen that shit up.  I can't wait until a couple of years from now when we get the double ties.  Yeah, it's coming.  In the suit.  Yeah.  Fax machines on the walls.  Fax machines.  2015, that shit starts.  Yeah.  Rainbow hats.  McFry!  Yeah.  Rainbow hats.  Self-fitting jackets.  Self-fitting, self-drying.  Mr. Fissions. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, it's going to be great.  Two years.  People in our city.  All you do is go to their homes, bid jobs, where they raise their families, where they  strive to improve their neighborhoods.  Neighborhoods.  Boston is the greatest city on earth.  Oh, shut up.  Great city, bud.  Yeah.  Where they strive to prove their neighborhoods. 
[02:01:30]  He's getting a little choked up.  Look at his mouth is going.  It's amazing.  The buzz around the city is amazing.  It's a history-making place.  Buzz coming out of your mouth.  The buzz is, I hear the mayor eats kids.  What the hell is going on in this city?  Don't graduate at the top of your class.  The mayor will eat you.  You know what the buzz in Boston is?  What?  Some jig shot a pregnant woman on the bridge.  Oh, my God.  That was the buzz in Boston.  What a fantastic city. 
[02:02:00]  You don't think they ever got over that?  No, no.  It's the greatest city in the world to foster a part of racial crime.  Race, crime.  And even then, if you get caught, do we have plenty of bridges to jump off of?  This gets better every day because of all of you.  What a hack.  As long as you work together.  Oh, yeah.  That will never change.  Thank you very much.  He is simply the most uninspiring speech giver ever in the whole public office. 
[02:02:30]  That will never change.  He can't.  Can you watch the last 20 seconds?  That was his closing line.  Dude, he can't get a moment.  That was supposed to be just a moment.  Yeah, this is supposed to be like the crescendo, the big fucking, you know, and everybody, what  a great job we've done.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I will be back.  I will still be here.  But like he just peters out.  It's like the end of that fucking, when you blow up a balloon and then let it go in 
[02:03:00]  the room, it's that last second where it goes, and it falls on the floor.  He stinks.  They're all moot points.  Yeah.  Just trivial dreck.  It's a bunch of balloons.  Zero energy.  Right at that last.  And then it just hits the floor.  That's really funny, man.  It stinks.  Let's hear it.  As long as you work together. 
[02:03:30]  Here it is.  That will never change.  Thank you very much.  And then thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  That will never change.  It's such a trite statement.  Yes.  It's such a hack political thing.  Oh, boy.  Well, that's like me closing my final show ever with.  And remember, guys, men and women are different.  You've been great.  And I've been Jim.  Good God.  What a trite thought. 
[02:04:00]  That actually would be funny if you said that at the end of the show, since you don't know  the difference yourself.  You know, remember, men and women are different, allegedly.  Oh, speaking of that, can we play audio from that broad?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I will acknowledge that.  That is the party.  But it's certainly worth playing.  So after the Louisville-Duke game yesterday, where that guy, Kevin Ware, broke his fucking  leg, we switched channels, and they had some NCAA women's basketball on.  Oh. 
[02:04:30]  They play like, I think, the men did back in the early 60s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Impressive.  But you could tell.  But you could tell.  They're way behind the men's game.  Right before we get there, before we completely move on from Menino.  Yeah, what happened?  You guys just made ABC News.  Ooh.  It's that time of the year again, when creative minds around the world devised elaborate ruses  to punk the masses.  Some, like the Taco Liberty Bell, have gone down in April Fool's infamy.  Others, like when Boston radio personalities Opie and Anthony announced that Mayor Thomas 
[02:05:00]  Menino had been killed in a car crash, he was very much alive, have gotten a less enthusiastic  reception.  Oh, yeah.  We make this list.  A job in New York City.  We make this list every year now.  Yes.  Every year for the last 15 years.  How long ago was that?  15 years.  Fuck.  What number are we this year?  I think...  Are we moving up?  You're not on...  They wouldn't put you on the list.  Oh.  They just give you a dubious mention.  Yeah, but we're in the first paragraph of a story.  That's pretty good.  That is pretty good. 
[02:05:30]  But we're not on the actual list of pranks?  A dubious mention.  A dubious mention.  Which one of my pranks made it?  They go on a dubious mention.  The dubious brothers.  The dubious brothers mentions.  No, the dubious brother.  Dubious brother.  The dubious brother.  The dubious brother.  Burger King's left-handed whopper.  Like, what's on this list of pranks?  Anything...  All right.  You got a spaghetti crop grows in Switzerland.  1957.  BBC News.  What does that mean?  They were growing spaghetti in a farm somewhere? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  But you can't grow spaghetti.  Yeah, that's hilarious.  There you go.  All right.  Uh, longest marathon ever.  Oh.  April 1st, 1981.  Issue of the Daily Mail.  Uh, Nakajimi.  Uh, had gone to England to compete in the London Marathon.  Due to a translation error, he thought the length was 26 days, not 26 miles.  Oh, man.  So was I mean.  And they said that he was running for 26 days.  And that was an April Fool's prank, though.  He wasn't actually running for that many days. 
[02:06:30]  Uh, Sid Finch could throw a fastball 168 miles.  Oh, Finchie.  Finchie.  Finchie.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why are you down there, love?  This is fucking great.  Finchie.  Tell him, Finchie, what happened?  He could throw a fastball 168 miles per hour.  Or so a Sports Illustrated article claimed in, uh, 1985.  That was an April Fool's day, Joe.  I remember that.  Oh, wow.  Vote Nixon.  What was that?  Vote Nixon.  He may have resigned nearly two decades earlier, but on April 1st, 1992, NPR's Talk of the Nation 
[02:07:00]  reported that Richard Nixon was running for president again under the slogan, I didn't do anything  wrong and I won't do it again.  And people bought that?  That was, uh, hmm.  Prank.  All right.  Burger King's left-handed Whopper, that was 98.  Burger King announced the arrival of the left-handed Whopper.  What?  The burger would contain the same ingredients as a regular sandwich, but would be redesigned  to fit more comfortably in the left hand.  Oh.  Well, why don't they do that? 
[02:07:30]  That sounds like a good idea.  On April 2nd, Burger King admitted that the new sandwich was a prank.  Well, thank God they admitted it was a prank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Imagine if the Burger King came out with, like, a really offensive thing for today.  Like, we're having a rape burger.  Rape burger.  What is that?  It's a small hamburger with a Whopper on top of it.  It's the rape combination.  That's a mistake all these dumb radio shows did over the years.  Like, when we did our April Fool's prank, the reason why it worked, we refused to tell 
[02:08:00]  people it was a prank.  We just assumed it's April 1st, we'll figure it out.  If they don't, they will eventually.  That's what got us in big trouble.  And remember...  Kept it going.  I remember Dave Dickless came in that day, and he basically was like, you know, he goes,  you got to go on the air and tell them it's fake.  And I'm like, no.  Yeah.  We're not.  And then I guess we agreed to say it at the end of the show.  But then the end of the show happened, and we did, and then he saw us.  He goes, I thought...  Like, oh, I thought you meant...  Oh, right. 
[02:08:30]  We said we...  I thought you meant so many times to Dave.  That's what I...  Oh, see, we thought you meant...  That's why I always hated April Fool's pranks, because people would just fucking give it  away an hour after they came up with this kind of smart prank.  Uh-huh.  But they couldn't commit to it ever.  You got to commit.  The life of Pi is one.  In 98, again, New Mexicans for Science and Reason newsletter, somebody wrote that Alabama  State Legislature had changed the value of 3.14159, which is Pi, to the biblical value 
[02:09:00]  of 3.0.  The piece went viral online, but it was just a joke.  The Alabama State Legislature had not done that.  Good one.  That's a wonderful joke.  Viagra for animals was one.  The Independent in Florida reported that researchers had developed a Viagra pill for pets, so pets  could have sex.  That was actually not true.  It was an April Fool's Day prank.  Oh, it was.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  Do you think pets have trouble getting boners after a while?  I don't think so.  I bet.  Not if you suck their dicks.  Not if you put your pinky in their asshole.  Yeah, you got to stimulate them.  This is a great day to tell people shit you don't really need to tell.  If you're with someone, you're cheating on them.  You're like, look, I've been fucking your best friend in the ass when you go to work.  What?  Yeah, you know, I think you point at the calendar.  I've been fucking her in the ass.  And she'll go, oh, God, I have to get ready for work. 
[02:10:00]  No time for your pranks.  But I told you.  Diet tap water is the last one that made this list.  Yeah, Yorkshire Water launched a 2004 campaign heralding its new Diet Tap Water, which had  allegedly helped customers lose 21 pounds and would be available in faucets across England.  A British morning show played along with it and devoted 45 minutes to the story.  However, it was an April Fool's Day prank. 
[02:10:30]  Damn it.  Really?  That one too?  Yeah, it wasn't.  They're pretty hilarious over there in England.  How about the Australian one where they killed the fucking nurse at the hospital?  That didn't happen in April.  Oh, okay.  I thought that was an April Fool's prank they played on the nurse.  That was just for fun.  Well, could you put me through to the princess's room?  Princess's room.  Well, and then fucking kill yourself.  No.  Well, there you go.  That's just some of the wild pranks.  Yeah, they're pretty wild, Sam. 
[02:11:00]  Thank you for bringing that to our attention.  We made another one of the April Fools.  Right.  The mayor wasn't really dead.  It was an April Fool's Day joke.  I heard that, yeah.  April Fool's Day list of pranks.  So here's, what's her name again?  Brittany Griner, is that how you pronounce it?  Griner, Griner, something like that.  You know, I like to do April Fool's jokes that nobody will ever know the answer to or care  about.  Like totally inconsequential things.  Like I'll talk to my friend, I'll go, yeah, man, I was so annoyed. 
[02:11:30]  I went to pour the cereal this morning and I realized I was out of it.  And then like an hour later, I'll come back and go, you really believed that shit, didn't  you?  About the cereal.  Yeah, I really didn't think about it much.  And then I just grabbed him by the shirt collar and I screamed, April Fool's!  Very aggressive with this.  Why would you be so aggressive?  Jimmy loves April Fool's Day.  He really does.  Like things that no one cares about.  Right.  Just fucking dribble.  Peach is really, it's just not as ripe as I was hoping. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  No?  And then like, what time is it now?  It's 8.40.  At like 11 o'clock tonight, I'll call all you guys and go, you know that peach thing I  did?  I was fucking around.  It was delicious.  Oh my God.  I wouldn't even know what to say.  I'm going to do that in the gym tonight.  If I find that girl with the perfect apple ass, I'm going to go, your ass, you know, I've  seen, your ass is a little flat.  Oh.  She'll go, what?  And she'll slap me and call me a masher. 
[02:12:30]  Then the next day, I'll see her tomorrow.  Like, I'm just kidding.  You're fucking, your ass is the bee's knees.  I jerk off to it a lot.  I was April fooling you.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  So this girl, who does she play for?  Baylor?  I don't even know.  She was on the TV yesterday and we were all like, holy fuck.  She talks like a dude.  Yeah, yeah.  And she kind of sits there like a dude. 
[02:13:00]  I don't know many women that sit like that.  Now, very masculine, this.  And the bone structure is a bit masculine, right?  Big fucking Adam's apple.  There is an Adam's apple.  Yes.  Yeah.  Listen to this, Jimmy.  This is how she sounds.  Oh, I think that was my subconscious.  You guys were actually just talking.  Listen to this.  For Baylor and get the 60 points for Baylor University towards the Capital One Cup.  It's just a great accomplishment. 
[02:13:30]  Like I said, I promised Coach and Baylor and everybody, all the fans,  that we were going to get one and we finally got it.  And to bring home the 60 points for the Capital One Cup, it's just an honor.  I'm glad we're able to do that.  And it's just going to, just another accomplishment for Baylor Athletics.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  Yeah, it sounds like she's injecting like testosterone or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  No tits.  Are you allowed to like testosterone, you think?  That sounds illegal.  If it's a women's league. 
[02:14:00]  That would probably be a, yeah.  You would swear that's a guy.  Absolutely.  I mean, just looking, too.  Yeah.  It looks like a dude.  Yeah, it looks, acts, talks, yeah.  Here, keep going.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  What was that?  That championship?  Holy fuck.  Did you have that other clip?  That would scare me if I was on the other team.  Yeah, yeah.  I bet if that is a girl. 
[02:14:30]  Is she one of the best players?  Gotta be a huge clit.  I guess she's one of the best players out there.  I don't know much about women's basketball.  When you can watch men's basketball, I don't know why you'd watch women's basketball.  Nah.  But it works both ways.  Why watch men's gymnastics when you can watch women's gymnastics?  Exactly.  Why would you do that to yourself?  Let's see a guy trying to fucking flip around.  I think gymnastics were made for women.  Yes.  Right?  Yes.  They're beautiful.  Yes. 
[02:15:00]  Fucking vaulting and tumbling.  Right.  Yes.  You got one more clip of her?  Yeah.  Aw.  Because we made our point, but it's just so weird to me.  Oh, jeez.  Damn.  It'll be okay.  Oh.  Sounded like feedback.  We're at Big 12 Media Day.  Oh, my God.  How are you doing?  I'm great.  Thank you.  How are you?  So, you know, we're very happy.  Excuse me. 
[02:15:30]  So, there's a storm coming.  Oh, my gosh.  I know a guy with art.  You are one.  No?  Cricket.  No?  Cricket.  Cricket.  No?  It's like a gay man, kind of.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's not even that gay.  A little.  Not even that gay.  Just, you'd be suspect.  You'd go, there's something about that guy that seems a little.  A little queeb.  A little quaggish.  Quaggish.  A little queebish.  What's going on with Derek Jeter? 
[02:16:00]  Why are they really talking?  He's not ready for opening day.  And it seems like he's not going to be ready anytime soon or something.  He has a sprained ankle.  There's nothing serious.  It's a sprain.  Oh, really?  April Fool's.  You got me on that one.  Yeah, he's, you know, he's no kid anymore.  The Yankees.  No.  He's going to be there, though, and say, well, not spirit.  He's going to be there.  He's going to be there.  You know, he rallies the troops.  What do you think he does after baseball? 
[02:16:30]  I mean, obviously, he'll probably coach professional work at the front.  I mean, he'll have a job with the Yankees for a while.  He's got too much money.  He'll fucking have a job with the Yankees.  It's not the money, though.  These guys like to be around it.  Yeah, but maybe he'll be a commentator or something.  Assistant to your traveling manager.  How about that?  No?  I don't know if he'd want to deal with the traveling secretary.  That was it.  You know what it is?  It has a real, because competitively, they can still compete in a way if they're managers. 
[02:17:00]  Like, you're competing with the team, and you're influential in the team.  You're in the game.  You get a ring.  You get to win something.  You're on the fucking field.  You're on the field more than half the players walking out doing pitching changes.  Get it.  Add your finger croaking towards the bullpen.  Hey, get Murray out of there.  Yeah.  Bring in whatever the new guy is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The U.S. face transplant recipient married a burn victim?  Yeah.  What a weird headline.  Part of the deal. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  What's that story about?  And got married in the same church where his face was melted in an electrical accident?  Whoa.  Is that how he lost his face?  Yep.  Holy shit.  Wait, wait, wait.  That guy was a mess.  That guy got married, huh?  He married a burn victim.  Probably, let's be honest, the ladies weren't lining up to fuck him.  Holy shit.  You remember that guy?  Oh my God, he didn't have any face.  Completely melted his face, for real. 
[02:18:00]  They just pulled the skin like over his eye sockets, his nose, nothing's left.  Yeah, that's what the fire did.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  His breathing must be so rough, dude.  Oh my God.  I thought my nose got stuffy.  That's gotta be terrible.  Oh God.  And now he's got like fucking, he's got Bubba the Love Sponge's face on him.  Jesus.  He's blind, right?  Obviously.  Yeah, his eyes went, you know.  Man. 
[02:18:30]  Oh my God, look at his face.  Did the goatee come with the face?  Or did he grow it later?  I'll bet it came with the new face.  I'll bet it did.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I feel like you take him to goatee.  He's like, I don't want to go on.  He looks like he's always going, oh well, since my baby left, I found a new place to dwell.  He's like, a honk, a honk of burning love.  His lip is constantly quivering?  It's constantly up in one corner. 
[02:19:00]  He's like, how are you doing?  I used to have no face.  It got burned off.  Well, my face was burned and they put a new one on my head.  I'm singing, Jimmy.  You got a lip going.  I'm sleepy.  It was just going on for so long. 
[02:19:30]  I have no fucking endgame.  That was just so funny.  What's that?  I don't know.  That's what he looks like.  So the goatee must have been real.  And he shaved it down.  Wait, that's how he looks like now?  What?  Yeah, he lost some weight and he took the shades off.  Dude, that looks...  Oh my God, he looks so weird.  He looks fake.  He looks terrible.  I mean, considering it doesn't look that bad.  Yeah, considering he should have no face.  Right.  That's pretty amazing what they could do. 
[02:20:00]  Holy shit.  But he got his face from someone that used to obviously have a pelican neck.  They couldn't cut the pelican neck part off the new face?  No, the fat there.  I guess that all had to come with it?  He's skinny, but his face is fat.  No, but he's got the pelican neck.  Yeah.  You would think they would have been able to not include that with the new face.  Because his whole face is chubby.  But now only his face is chubby.  Right.  He's kind of slender.  He is a slender guy. 
[02:20:30]  Oh my God.  That is unbelievable.  Can he speak?  I don't know.  Is there any audio of him?  Oh my God.  And as you find that, New York dead last in personal freedoms.  Yeah.  New York and California, right?  And California.  No surprises.  Dead last.  And roughly 1.7 million people left New York between 2000 and 2010.  People are leaving because they know they could get a better life somewhere else.  No surprises.  They are.  It's horrible. 
[02:21:00]  New York state is a horrible state.  Is it the whole state or are they talking cities here?  Well, California.  Okay.  So I guess it's the whole state.  The whole state.  Hmm.  You got stupid fucking Cuomo now.  It's just terrible.  Yeah, we really are.  We're just fucking being trounced as far as our personal freedoms.  That's them being married?  What?  Holy fuck.  Let's see.  She don't look that burnt up.  Look at her arm. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, really?  Considering what happened to him?  Yeah.  I know.  That's a 10 in the burn community.  Yeah, right?  In the burn community.  Oh, no.  Perhaps he went through.  I don't know.  What?  I saw that.  Nothing.  You were going to say something mean or?  Maybe.  Or a little.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, that's a fake arm?  Which one's fake?  Does she have a hook?  It looks like it might be.  She's holding a bouquet with a hook, I think.  Maybe it's a real arm and a fake hand.  Maybe.  She looks fine.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy. 
[02:22:00]  Did she get to him.  Fuck, she got burnt.  You can see, like, a pattern on her of some sort.  She got burnt pretty good.  That's the graft, right?  She's kissing her.  It's like, oh.  Every kiss is an open mouth kiss with him.  Why would you wear an open-back wedding dress, though?  Well, you know.  I guess he asked her, too, because this would...  I'm not going to say that.  I know.  Why are we doing this?  Let them get married and have fun.  Good for them.  Enjoy your lives.  If you didn't go bobbing for capacitors.  Lives.  What? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, Jesus.  An electrical joke.  How the fuck?  Wow, man.  What the hell was he working on that blew his whole face off?  Jesus.  Some kind of a...  It's something just...  It was a fire, I think, or he just got shocked.  Big electrical.  Probably arced right through his face.  Yikes.  That's horrible.  Really, it was just horrible.  All right.  We're going to break, and I think Joe DeRose is coming in.  He's starting a tour or something tomorrow.  An actual tour, or is he just going to a comedy club and fucking...  Joe is big on...  Oh. 
[02:23:00]  Is it an actual tour?  I can give you the info if you want it.  I'm not going to give it now, though.  I'll be giving the info April 11th through 14th here in New York at Caroline's.  And then April 19th and 20th at fucking Magoobies in Baltimore.  Magoobies.  And I'm doing...  I'm plugging April 27th in Austin, and then...  I'm doing Salt Lake City again?  May 10th and 11th?  Oh, sweet.  Joe DeRose does a lot of those Vine videos. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, he's a Vine guy?  The Vine videos.  I don't believe in the Vine.  I don't either.  I made one video on Vine.  It's just weird.  I made one video on Vine.  You believe in the Vine, Jimmy?  I have Vine.  Bob Kelly put out a really sexy photo of me doing the Game of Thrones...  The video of me and my Game of Thrones dance.  You didn't see it?  I did see it.  It's fucking hot.  Is it?  It's like six seconds.  Well, they're all six seconds.  Pretty much.  That's the max.  It's fun, but you can't...  I don't like the people who do Vine, and it's just one long take.  You like Vine?  Yeah, but you've got to split it up.  I split mine up.  You've got to split it up. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, you Vine?  No.  I Vined.  I Vined.  I have one video of me Vining my first Vine video, which I was influenced by every single  other Vine video I've ever seen in my whole fucking life.  Right.  They don't make it for the fucking Android phones.  So that's...  Is it easy to find?  Oh, that's why you don't believe it.  Can you find my fucking Vine?  Yeah, of course that's why I don't believe, because it's not available for my phone.  Where's my Vine?  And what takes them so long to get it on other phones?  I mean, it's taken off this Vine thing. 
[02:24:30]  What are they waiting for?  Hey, where's the Vine?  Why can't you just search Anthony Cumia Vine?  If you do, I hope a picture of a fucking... of a beam comes in.  See the Vine hanging on it?  Like a noose?  Oh my...  I don't get it.  It was just a joke saying, I hope you hang yourself with a Vine.  Oh, okay.  It was just long and unfunny and mean.  Oh, poor Sam can't find it. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, well.  And then I have another...  There's two more videos of Pat from Unaki, who was over my house Friday when I was having  my poker game.  Does he have a hot chick?  I saw the picture.  Dude.  Did he bring her as his chick?  Yeah.  Wow.  They went into the theater.  They watched a movie together while we were all playing poker.  Were they noodling?  I don't know what was going on, but let me tell you something.  I don't know what the fuck is going on.  We were all flabbergasted. 
[02:25:30]  Is he trying to save another soul?  Oh, remember that?  He was trying to save his soul last time.  Was he?  No, this girl...  She looks all right.  Yeah.  Good for you, Pat.  Have you seen any pictures?  I saw.  I saw what you tweeted.  Yeah.  Why don't you go to vine.com?  I did.  And then in the search, you put fucking...  Because it's not...  What?  All right.  I'll go to vine.com.  Okay.  And then what should I search?  How about Anthony Cumia? 
[02:26:00]  Look at vine.com.  What?  Oh, it's fucking Vine.  How about vine.  Fucking...  What is it called then?  If you were coming up with some new social networking thing, wouldn't you search it out  to make sure no one else has your name yet?  Yeah, you'd think.  I don't know if there is a web client for it.  Oh, it's just the app.  Oh, fuck them.  And not available for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  Well, fuck them.  Bobby made an amazing Vine video.  Of me doing the Game of Thrones dance.  Oh, you found it?  Well, we can't watch it on the computer.  Oh, you can't?  Oh, that's...  Let's see if I can get it.  You can go to Bob's Twitter link. 
[02:26:30]  Well, obviously we can.  But for some reason we can't.  But now we've got to find it through his whole feed.  Yeah.  Well, he did it last night.  Like, I don't know.  Oh, he did.  What happened?  Is this Jim Norton?  Mm-hmm.  It's the Game of Thrones music and Jimmy doing a stupid dance.  It's delightful.  Oh, does that look stupid?  It's a wonderful dance.  Do-do-do-do-do.  It's viral. 
[02:27:00]  I don't think so.  Oh, God.  That's so bad.  That's a good dance?  Oh.  How was it?  Was it good last night?  I was driving.  I was in...  Jimmy had a great tweet about it because I can't even remember where I put my fucking  car keys and I'm supposed to remember from a year ago who these people are.  Oh.  It's been that long?  Well.  Eight months probably?  Yeah.  That was tough.  I had to DVR Walking Dead.  Then I watched Game of Thrones live.  Mm-hmm.  Then I watched Walking Dead DVR. 
[02:27:30]  So I'm all set.  All fucking shit.  All right.  We're going to break.  Get Joda Rosen here.  Talk about some other shit.  Well, E-Rock's got something pretty amazing for break, so why don't you play that now  there, E-Rock?  Oh.  The Opinion 3 Channel.  Oh, yeah!  On Sirius XM.  Lieutenant Marion Cobra Cobretti is out on the streets cleaning up the scum.  Do you know how much damage you did out there, Cobretti?  Yeah.  Much as I needed. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, I got those people out of there.  Cobretti likes women who shit on tabletops made of glass that he's sitting on.  I like that.  It's a fetish, but it keeps me relaxed in my topsy-turvy world.  Cobretti likes a nice, firm shit.  I've got a hot deuce for you, Cobretti.  Hey, Cobra.  This is my fat wife, Susan.  Could you drink some beer and shoot her in the face?  Obesity's the disease. 
[02:28:30]  Diet's the cure.  Lieutenant Marion Cobra Cobretti.  Yeah, right.  I got a name like a faggot, but I sure as fuck do kick some ass.  Hey, Cobra.  Sirius XM.  It's the OP Realtry Show.  Yo, Josh. 
[02:29:00]  Marvin Gaye.  Marvin Gaye Day.  Sorry.  Mother, mother.  Fuck him.  There's too many of you to cry.  The Negro.  Brother, brother, brother.  In person.  Brother, brother.  There's far too many of you to cry.  Poor guy.  You know we've got to find you.  I'm getting, um...  To bring some love in you.  I'm scared. 
[02:29:30]  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please call the police.  What did his father shoot him for?  They argued and they were drunk.  Both of them were drunk?  I think...  Uh, no, I think...  I think Marvin Gaye was on drugs and drunk, and his dad was like a religious guy being like,  you're a disgrace, you've got to clean yourself up, and they got into a fight, and his dad like shot him.  Oh, that's good.  Well, that's like fucking, um...  What movie was that?  Uh...  Uh...  Jungle Fever? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, yeah, Woody...  Samuel L. Jackson's dad kills him.  Yeah, yeah.  That fuck, it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  He does the dance.  Yeah, that was crazy.  Fucking tension in that scene with Ruby Dee.  It's like, how can you not?  That's one of the saddest scenes ever.  Who plays the dance in that?  Ozzie Davis?  Ozzie Davis.  Ozzie Davis.  Very good, yeah.  Well, Marvin Gaye died 29 years ago.  That's 29 years already.  He was 44.  Man.  Jesus.  Father tried to help him and then killed him.  That's terrific.  And his father said before he shot him, he goes, you're my son, and I love you, but you're evil. 
[02:30:30]  You're evil.  And as he shot him, he said, I'll pray for you, my son.  He is.  Jonah Rose in studio.  Of course.  Hi, guys.  What, you got a tour starting tomorrow or something?  Yeah, I'm doing a tour in the South.  They're calling it a tour.  It is.  It's one of the only real tours I've ever done.  Wow.  I put it together myself, but it's a lot of small music venues and small little theaters  and big coffee houses.  You know, it's like...  Are you going to be on a tour bus?  No, I'm driving it myself, man.  Grassroots. 
[02:31:00]  Like...  You're going to drive?  Like a band in a van, yeah.  Yeah.  So I'm driving through, and then it starts...  But it starts this coming Thursday in Atlanta at the Laughing Skull.  I'm doing a weekend there, recording my new comedy album, and then I'm touring all the  way through the South and landed in Austin at Texas at the end of the month.  So it's fall and April, JoeDeRosaComedy.com for dates, and I'm going all over the place.  You're going to be on the road for the whole month.  You're not coming back.  No.  There's a show almost every day.  What? 
[02:31:30]  Wait, there's a show almost every day?  Yeah, almost every day.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.  It'll be fun.  I mean, I'm going to go a little batshit being alone for that one.  You're going to film some stuff?  You should videotape stuff.  I got a little, like, what's it called, a harness or a mount for my phone for it in  the car, and I don't know.  The GoPro, man.  It's all about the GoPro.  Yeah, GoPro is pretty goddamn good.  If you can't do this, you should fucking get some nice video.  What's the GoPro?  Oh, what's the GoPro?  Oh, what's the GoPro?  Look at that.  That's a GoPro.  Look at it.  Where do I get one of those? 
[02:32:00]  Can't get them.  They're sold out.  At the GoPro store.  Jesus Christ.  They're all sold out.  Are they really?  Yeah, they're making more, though.  What would take amazing...  They're so colorful.  April Fool's.  April Fool's.  April Fool's.  Tee-hee.  We so got you.  We're not even on the air, are we?  Nope.  April Fool's.  Oh, that would be a great one.  How great would that one be?  I'll go get one of those things.  You just gave me a great idea.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm going to use that one.  You don't need it to be April Fool's, either. 
[02:32:30]  That's just being a dick.  Wait, wait.  Shh, shh.  This cost $4,000.  Four grand.  April Fool's.  Oh, shit.  Fucking nailed him.  I should have seen his fucking face.  Fuck off.  So, Joe, how's the relationship going?  Last time you were here was about a month ago, maybe a little more, and you were in love,  man.  You were a different and changed person.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Well, that's over. 
[02:33:00]  You spilled your guts out to us.  It wasn't just a floozy.  You were like, hey, guys.  I remember you even saying, hey, guys, be cool.  She's my girlfriend.  Yeah, I know.  I know what I said.  You're all in.  I know what I said.  You do remember.  I date a chick, and it's like, I don't know.  It's like, am I the same rationale as when am I going pot?  Right.  You know what I mean?  Everything's like amplified.  I get paranoid.  You were in love. 
[02:33:30]  We were looking at you.  Has it changed in a different person?  What happened?  Where did it go wrong?  We had some communication issues.  Let me sum it all up.  Wait, wait, wait.  You have to go all the way back to, all right, you leave the show.  We haven't seen you in a while.  Yeah.  So, like, break it down.  Like, what started happening?  She heard one of your fucking Bailey J rants.  Everybody's not kidding.  If she was in the hospital, you'd blow Bailey J in the fucking waiting room.  In the waiting room. 
[02:34:00]  She, uh, you know, we were having these communication issues, and, uh.  You can't just say communication issues.  There was a bit of an age difference.  Right.  And I'm not demeaning her.  I'm not calling her immature.  There was just a bit of an age difference.  How much of an age difference?  She was not huge.  She was in her late 20s, mid to late 20s.  I'm 35.  She was like an eight-year difference.  Oh, that's crazy.  Eight, nine-year difference.  What the fuck do you think you're doing?  Jesus.  I mean, what, you know.  I mean, this is like, what, this is crazy, right?  You gotta be closer together in age. 
[02:34:30]  There's a generational gap here.  This is, uh, it didn't make sense, you know.  Yeah.  My people come from a different time, you know.  But how?  I mean.  No, but, I mean, all kidding aside, eight years, that's doable.  Like, what, what, where was the communication problem?  Here's what the problem was.  With someone that's eight years younger than you.  I, I rushed, I rushed us into a relationship.  I was positive, uh, this is what I want.  I want to do this, whatever.  We got into the relationship, and then once I was in it, and I was really trying to do  it right, like, I'm not gonna cheat. 
[02:35:00]  I'm not gonna do anything.  I'm gonna be in a relationship, and be in love with this person.  When you can, when, I don't know, when you throw everything in like that.  You'll put yourself out there.  You fucking pig.  Probably hated your taste in music.  That's probably what broke you guys.  She loved my taste in music.  No one can love, no one can love your taste in music.  It was, it was, there was just those communication issues become obvious, where it's like, we would  get into arguments, and she would kind of shut down, and it was tough, and I was like. 
[02:35:30]  What would you argue about?  Even if we just get in an argument about something small, like, you know, hey, sweetie, you know,  when you did this, it really bothered me, like, I'm trying to get out the door, and I buy  his dinner and everything, and then you're not even helping me, like, clean the plates  up, like, come on.  Was that you or her saying that, you faggot?  You're a girl.  No, I said that.  You were saying that she wouldn't help you with the dishes?  I was saying, like, we, ew.  You're a hot young chick, and you're giving a shit.  Oh, my God.  Like, God, Joe.  And you're complaining? 
[02:36:00]  What the fuck?  She didn't do the dishes?  Fuck.  No, no, no.  No, I wasn't complaining she didn't do the dishes.  We got her in an argument one night.  She didn't want to clean up.  Hold on.  Holy fuck.  If I tell you.  You came here for sympathy.  You're fucked.  I'm done.  You're fucked.  Yeah, this is where I come for sympathy.  I can't help you clean up dirty dishes?  I got a worse argument.  If you guys want to really get into trash in here.  I want that one first.  Yeah, finish this one.  Okay, because, yeah, all right.  All right.  We got in a little bit of an argument, because I had to do, I was doing Artie's show, and 
[02:36:30]  it's at night.  Uh-huh.  And I was, she was coming over to meet me, and she was running late, and I was like,  look, I'll order dinner.  I'll have it here for us.  I'll have everything set up, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  She came in.  Obviously, I bought dinner and everything.  We sat down.  We ate.  And then I got up, and I was like, picking up the dishes, and I'm kind of rushing, and  she was just kind of sitting there, and I was just kind of like, you know, it kind  of bugged me that you didn't just try to help me a little bit.  What?  You're a girl.  No, no, no.  She was a girl.  I see his point.  I hate to see his point. 
[02:37:00]  Really?  Yes.  You're out there.  You're going to do a gig on TV, and the fucking lump you're dating won't fucking pick up  a dish.  Hey.  I get it.  She is the dish.  I mean, you actually get it?  This is not a bit?  No, I get it.  Can't the dishes wait?  Who gives a fuck?  That's true.  Exactly.  I don't even go do the art show, and then...  That's my fine china.  That's true.  I rescind.  I don't know.  How long were you dating at that point? 
[02:37:30]  I don't know.  Months?  Months?  No.  Yeah, that's still new.  You're just looking at her...  You're not bitching about dishes a month in.  With adoring love in your eye as you're cleaning that shit up.  Right.  But here's the thing.  I'm moving tomorrow, and finally back into a one-bedroom apartment like a human being.  But I've been living in a studio.  You leave dishes out in a studio apartment, it's disgusting, dude.  It's not like leaving the dishes out in the kitchen.  For how long, though?  You were coming back.  You know, and I was going to be out of that apartment for at least 65 minutes.  How many plates?  All right?  How many plates? 
[02:38:00]  Two plates?  It's two people.  Two cups in a pot?  Who cares?  You didn't throw a fucking wedding in there.  Look, guys, you're a neat freak, aren't you?  You can trash me on this one all you want.  I got a much better one for you guys to trash me on.  But hold on, I need to know.  Are you kind of a neat freak to begin with?  Yeah, I'm completely OCD-ish.  All right, well, that plays into it, obviously.  When we broke up, she goes, when we broke up, she goes, you're much darker than I thought  you were.  Oh, shit.  That's what we saw that was different when you came in here.  We're like, wow, fuck, he's not as dark anymore.  It's funny, like, every time I date a girl seriously, like, they watch my comedy and 
[02:38:30]  they think it's funny.  Hey, he's a fun guy.  Yeah, that story's funny where you scream at the lady at Best Buy and she calls the cops  on you.  That's really funny.  And then you date me and they're like, oh, you really do stuff like that.  Oh, you did that.  Yeah, you didn't just write that.  Yeah.  But here's one.  This one.  I hesitate to even tell you this.  Oh, now you have to.  You want to turn the lights down?  You want to turn the lights down?  No, no.  I don't want to hear this.  So, I went on this diet when I was dating her. 
[02:39:00]  The meat diet?  Yeah.  How did it go?  Hey, you should have given her the meat diet.  Oh, with cream sauce, you whore.  By the way, all I wanted to do was text you yesterday, I dyed my chick's eggs today with  my fucking lobe, you pig, and dice, and dice, and dice.  Me and Joe have been known to spend like hours on nights with me at home or him out or at  home something, and text each other back and forth, dice-isms. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, that's great.  And they all end up in capital letters with just whore and goo and fucking balls.  Will you please just real quick do a dice-eggs bit?  Hey, it's Easter.  Why don't you color my eggs?  And by eggs, I mean my balls on your nose.  Oh, you like peeps?  You like peeps?  I got a peep in my pants for you. 
[02:40:00]  For the banana juice.  Banana juice.  Wait, I got one too.  Oh, go ahead.  Hickory dickory dog juice.  The fucking Easter Bunny sucked a bunch of fucking cocks or something.  Fucking going.  Chip, yeah, that was a good one, Chip.  Double poems.  Eight for fools, it wasn't.  I got you.  That hurt.  So what happened, Joe?  So I was on the meatless diet. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, meatless.  Meatless, yeah.  Yeah, meatless diet.  The night before I went on it, I'm a big meat guy.  Like, I'm a carnivore.  Well, that's the last time you hear it.  You indulged.  You talk about it.  I indulge in what?  The day before you went on the meat diet.  Oh, yeah.  The non-meat diet.  No, we're connected to this.  That was the last time we were on the show.  You said, man, I'm now officially on a meat diet, but before, I went crazy the night before  and had all sorts of fucking meat.  The fight relates to this.  Really?  To that, to that, to the binge. 
[02:41:00]  So, yeah, the night before I went on this meat diet, I ordered from Hill Country Barbecue,  and I got, like, upwards of $100 worth of barbecue.  And I'm like, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to go out on a high note with meat.  So, obviously, I couldn't eat all of it, and I felt guilty.  I'm like, why did I spend all that money on it?  That was stupid.  Like, that was just a waste.  But I had all this food left, and it was really good, and it was like, I didn't want to just throw it away,  but I had to get it out of my house because I was like, I'm going to eat it.  I'm not going to do this diet if it's sitting here. 
[02:41:30]  I can't resist the temptation.  I'm already getting uncomfortable.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Yeah, go ahead.  So, I package it all up, and I give it to her, and I go, listen.  I go, do me a favor.  Please, take this home and eat it.  Give it to your roommates, whatever.  I go, just don't.  I just, I can't.  She goes, just keep.  I go, I can't.  I'm going to eat it, and I don't want to just throw it away.  It costs enough money that I want to throw it away.  You're a cheapskate.  Yeah, yeah.  She so threw it away.  Oh, boy.  She so threw it away. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, no.  Go ahead.  The day after the plate thing, the plate argument was tied into this.  Oh, Jesus.  I said to her, I go.  It's a month in.  I go, so what happened?  I go, hey, that barbecue was good, right?  Did you enjoy it?  Like, not trying to start anything.  I just was really asking her.  Why didn't you bring it up?  I just went.  He was testing her.  No, you are.  Yes.  You couldn't handle it.  Exactly.  You needed to know if she did the right thing.  There's no doubt in my mind.  Jim, you might be.  I don't know.  Jim, I might be right on it.  I might have been testing her on a subconscious. 
[02:42:30]  I don't know.  But I wasn't trying to actively start a fight.  I just wanted to ask her something.  This was our first argument.  And I go, how was it?  It was good, right?  And she goes, she goes, what?  And I go, the meat that I gave her.  And she goes, I gave it to a junkie.  And I go, what?  And she goes, I gave it to a junkie.  And I go, what do you mean you gave it to a junkie?  I told you to take it home and eat it or give it to your friends or something.  She goes, I gave it to a junkie, whatever.  He wanted something.  He was hungry.  And I was like, I go, you gave it to a fucking scab on the street? 
[02:43:00]  Like some scumbag?  But he's hungry, too.  It didn't go to waste.  That, to me, was a much better thing to do.  Yes.  That's a much better option.  I got real mad.  I beat a homeless guy.  I got real mad.  The guy might have got enough protein in his system.  It turned his whole life around.  He finally realized, fuck, what am I doing to myself?  Give me enough energy to push someone in front of a train is what it did.  Fuck them.  I always give food and money to homeless guys all the time.  But she lives down in the East Village.  So when she goes junkie, I'm picturing one of those douchebags in a fucking leather jacket 
[02:43:30]  that doesn't feel like paying his fucking rent.  But maybe that prevented this guy from actually clocking her over the head.  No.  No.  It wasn't that kind of...  It wasn't a bribe to get out of danger.  She just gave him.  He said, can you have any money?  And I...  Well, here's the thing.  This is what she said.  She goes, I gave him the food.  And I go, why'd you give it to him?  I go, that's a waste.  That fucking guy doesn't want that food.  He just wants to get smack or whatever.  And she goes, well, I wasn't going to give him money. 
[02:44:00]  And I go, oh.  Oh, I go, oh, okay, so I get it.  So you weren't going to give him your money, but you can give him my money, so that's okay,  right?  And she's like, what are you talking about?  I go, you're sitting here telling me you don't want to give a junkie money.  Why don't you want to give a junkie money?  Because a junkie's going to waste the money.  He's not going to put it towards something good.  Do you think that fucking guy's going to eat that food?  He's going to throw that food in the trash or try to sell it so he can get smacked.  I go, no, he's going to eat it.  That's what they do when you give him food.  They eat it.  That's what they do.  They can't eat food out of the garbage.  If somebody hands him food, they'll eat it. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, he can't resell your fucking meat.  He's not going to resell your terrible fucking meat binge.  And your fucking leftovers.  Guys, listen.  That was a much nicer thing she did.  You so need to live by yourself for the rest of your life.  I know I was completely wrong in this argument, which is why I'm telling it to you.  But it's only a month in.  No, now I do.  But it's only a month in.  It was only a month in.  And we got into a big fight.  And then I go, and you didn't clean up the plates.  Oh, no.  A month in, you should be going and mean this.  And mean it.  That is so fucking sweet of this girl. 
[02:45:00]  Holy shit.  I fucking love her more every day.  Exactly.  At least she wasn't self-centered and I threw it out.  That was right.  Right.  She's a nice girl.  But there's Joe.  Old Dr. Rosa.  In her mind, she was doing...  What's wrong with me?  What's wrong with me?  She's a pretty girl.  In her mind, she was doing the right thing.  Oh, Joe.  So then what happened after that?  It was downhill after that?  Oh, God.  Because that's only a month in.  Then I went away to do my special.  Joe's Vine videos last longer than his relationship. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, my God.  I went away to do my special.  And I didn't bring her with me.  And that's when I started to think, like, maybe something's not right here.  Because...  And now, in the foreground of my head or whatever, you know, I was like, my parents are coming.  I'm taping this thing.  It's kind of a stressful situation.  I don't know if I want to do the, like, hey, girlfriend, meet my parents.  And I got to do this taping. 
[02:46:00]  And also, too, when you do, like, the half hour versus, like, your own hour, it's not, like, your production.  You know what I mean?  You're at the mercy of the series.  And it was like, if it was just my thing and I could kind of kick back more in the sense of, like, this is mine, then maybe I could have more people I know around.  But this would be like bringing somebody with me to do, like, Letterman.  And it's just too stressful.  Yeah, right.  You know, I got too much in my mind.  So I didn't bring her.  But I did think, like...  But that makes sense.  It does make logical or rational sense. 
[02:46:30]  But at the same time, I was like, the fact that I'm not upset that I'm not bringing her...  Say, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was like, something's probably wrong here.  She's a comic, right?  She's a comic.  But she's more of, like, a web blog, video blog person.  That's not how he talked about her a month or two.  No, I don't mean that to meaning.  She's just a blogger.  No, she's just a blogger.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  I remember him saying, oh, she's really talented and creative.  I don't think I ever saw her.  She's doing a web series.  Comedian, stenographer. 
[02:47:00]  She's just some dumb blogger.  I don't think I ever saw her, no.  Don't say her name on the air, though.  You weren't here that day.  I don't think I met her.  No, no, no.  You weren't here?  No, I won't say her name.  I just want to put a face to this so I can see what Joe was throwing away.  I love her.  Over the most inane, ridiculous shit.  We're going to have to make a production piece because I remember he had, like, love in his eyes.  Oh, she's very talented and funny and does a web series. 
[02:47:30]  I don't know.  She's some kind of blogger.  He says now.  That one.  Let's see.  Blow that pic up.  I remember.  Let me see.  Yeah.  She's pretty.  She's really pretty.  I miss her.  Oh, wow.  Oh, Joe.  Oh, Joe.  You're telling her to do dishes?  I could just picture it.  All I picture now is her yelling at you.  Oh, shit.  Like, I gave it to a junkie.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  She couldn't believe what a chiseler you are.  She's like, I'm young and good looking and I fuck him.  What's wrong with you?  A chiseler.  I didn't tell her to do the dishes.  Like, Joe's getting mad. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  So, go ahead.  Go back to your story.  No.  What's wrong with you?  How was the sex?  I gave you a chance at love and you blew it.  Oh, no.  The sex was good?  Yeah, everything.  Nice.  Everything was in its right place.  For the first week?  There's something wrong with me.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm bad at relationships.  So, anyway, you said you didn't feel bad that you didn't bring her.  And that was your first clue that maybe this isn't going to work out. 
[02:48:30]  I just felt like I should be really upset about this.  I should be sitting here going, why is she not here?  God damn it.  I hate that she can't be here.  I just want to be with her.  And I didn't have any of that feeling.  And not that I didn't miss her, but I just felt like a month and a half in, this should  be a lot stronger right now.  Wow.  Well, a text from a woman says, so it's her fault that he's a cheap, passive-aggressive  dick.  That's what a woman listening is saying.  Wow. 
[02:49:00]  You're not winning the ladies over, Joseph.  Hey, I rarely do, you know?  I kind of agreed with you about that first thing, though.  The dishes, really?  You know, I understand his annoyance at that.  Yeah, as much as, like, I would, it's like, yeah, she's young and hot, but I do get that.  It was a little selfish to not help him clean up.  Yeah, and let me, and she actually said to me, you're right, I was being bratty.  She goes, I was being bratty.  I should have helped you with that.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Let me just say this in a final ditch effort for my own defense.  Oh, this ain't going to be final.  No, it won't be.  We will pound you on this until 10 o'clock, my friend. 
[02:49:30]  And we still got to hear about the breakup.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to know it all.  Who did what to who?  Yeah.  Who she's fucking now?  I love this shit.  He said, she said.  Yes, dish.  Here's the thing.  I'm going to make a rom-com out of this.  He said, she said, you think?  He said, she said.  When you, when you, and I don't mean this in a sexist way, but if you're, if you're a dope.  Go back to that picture.  What do you think? 
[02:50:00]  She's quirky and funny.  Right, right, right.  Good looking.  Goddamn.  Because the fuck she can't wash a dish.  Oh, Joe.  Of course.  I'm not saying.  You back off, Norton.  I wouldn't do that to you.  The wound is still fresh.  You can't do that to a friend.  I know.  They only dated for a week.  Oh, my Joe.  What do you think?  Go ahead, Joe.  Oh, you're fucked up.  Does she like eating really good restaurants?  Oh, look at that.  Very artsy.  Black and white.  You wanted her to wash dishes.  That's beautiful.  I didn't want her to wash the dishes. 
[02:50:30]  I just wanted her to help me pick them up.  Earn your keep, you fucking cunt.  Take out the garbage.  He's throwing dishes at her like she's Connie Corleone.  Guinea brat.  Guinea brat.  I got to do all these shows, you Guinea brat.  You probably handed her a list of chores.  Look at that picture, all nice and artsy.  Did she have to dust your apartment, too, while you were gone?  By the way, I treated her fucking great.  You don't think I didn't do a lot of nice things, Joe?  Sounds like paradise.  I did a lot of fucking favors for her, too, you know? 
[02:51:00]  What did you do for her that was nice?  What did you do for her that was nice besides ending with her?  Got her gloves so when she washes...  I was going to say get her gloves so when she's washing the dishes, it doesn't fuck up her hands.  The Playtex living gloves?  I bought her a lot of nice things.  Thanks.  Got some gentle hand soap?  What did you buy?  That was nice.  I'm sure you did.  Loom for my prick.  You know, she gave your gifts to a junkie somewhere. 
[02:51:30]  This is my point.  This is all I was saying about the dish thing.  I wasn't saying get up and do the dishes.  I was saying, you know what?  I pay for dinner all the time, whatever.  I don't have a problem with it.  I'm not complaining.  At the very least right now.  But girls don't want to hear that I pay for dinner all the time.  Did you just kind of lend me a hand?  No.  You shouldn't even think that.  Why, though?  You should...  Because you just, at that point in a relationship...  It's early.  You just shouldn't even think that.  Right.  It's too early for that shit.  You should be like, oh, you just sit.  I'm glad she's relaxing. 
[02:52:00]  You know what?  You know what?  You're absolutely right.  And that's...  It was my fault because at that point in the relationship, we were too far into the relationship  for how long we'd been dating.  If she was just...  You jumped right in.  Yeah.  That was the problem.  If it was a month in and she had come over like, oh, it's our fifth date, I wouldn't have  given a fuck.  I would have been like, no, no, no, sit there, sit there, sit there.  But when you...  We started going out way too quick.  Were you going to cohabitate?  Dude, I wouldn't have been...  If we kept dating, I wouldn't have been surprised if within six months we were talking about that.  Why did you want to be in a relationship so fast? 
[02:52:30]  Did you just feel it with her or were you afraid you were going to date someone else?  Because you can't fuck a relationship up unless you're in one, Jim.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  I'm like a scientist.  Right, right.  I like to destroy the thing since you have to rebuild it.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to build it quick, though.  So you come home from the taping of your special with this feeling like, oh, maybe something's  not right.  How much longer did the relationship last?  Not even a week. 
[02:53:00]  It was fast.  So you came in here in love and you were done a week later.  Two weeks later.  Because I think you came in to promote the special.  Let me think.  Well, but I taped the special.  Then I was on the road for like another two weeks after that.  And then I came back.  Had the special turn up.  Good.  Thank you.  Yeah.  And then I came back after that.  And then, you know, it was.  And then we hung out.  We had a great time.  She went with me to get my new apartment because I'm moving. 
[02:53:30]  And she.  Did she have to move all your boxes into right now?  No, Joe.  I'm getting sad.  She was like.  Look how pretty she is.  Why would she do?  Sometimes.  She did something nice.  She came with me to sign my lease.  And she was so excited for me and so supportive.  And she's like, this is so great.  Oh, she's like.  Oh, baby.  Look, you got a place.  And I'm moving to where I'm moving because of her.  Like I was going to move to Queens.  And she was the one that was like, what are you doing?  And she's like, if you're going to move, move to Brooklyn.  And she was the one that put it in my head.  And I went out to Brooklyn.  And I was like.  And I like loved it. 
[02:54:00]  And I'm like, oh, this is going to be awesome out here.  I can't wait.  So now the place will always remind you of her.  Here we go.  We just.  We just went over the roller coaster.  Here's my.  Here's Dr.  Dice's prescription.  You got to shoot as much goo in this new place as possible.  Forget about this broad.  What are you, a faggotino?  Oh, boy.  And I might need a weekend out at the compound soon.  Indeed.  You definitely got to come on out. 
[02:54:30]  So she picked a new place for you to move into.  Like she's like, I like this place.  She didn't pick the place.  But she like really nudged me towards the neighborhood and said like, trust me.  This is what you want.  This is going to make you happier.  It's way better.  She was.  She was really nurturing.  Oh, my God.  She was really nurturing.  So I came home.  We had a great couple days.  Like we hung out the first night I was back and we had a nice time.  And then the next day she came with me to sign the lease and all that stuff.  And she was really excited.  And then I don't remember exactly what happened. 
[02:55:00]  But she called me and she goes, I need to talk to you later.  And I go, okay.  And I knew it.  I was like, this is the end.  But again, I wasn't upset about it.  I was like, I should be upset about this right now.  Something's wrong.  And she called me and she's like, what's going on?  You're being weird.  This and that and the other thing.  And I was like, yeah, I go, I just, I go, I just feel like we have so much fun.  But as soon as it gets to anything a little deeper or heavier, not meaning like, hey, let's move this forward and get closer. 
[02:55:30]  Meaning like, if we get into like an argument or I disagree with you about something in an argument, you take it so hard.  And I was like, it's just, it's, it's not that heavy.  It's like, we can disagree about stuff and we can recognize that things are flawed and it doesn't have to be completely depressing.  How long did you date her total?  A few months.  Not that long.  How long ago did you break up?  A few weeks ago. 
[02:56:00]  Maybe about three weeks.  It wasn't that long, the whole thing.  But I will say, probably, she might be the only girl I've ever broken up with that I've like legitimately missed, that I like care about, that I still think like, it's confusing.  I call, this is what I mean.  I don't know if I'm airing too much or whatever.  She'd probably not be happy.  No, make you feel better.  But we talked after, we're on good terms right now.  We talked after the fact and I said to her, and this is what I mean about just an age difference. 
[02:56:30]  This is something I think that comes with getting into your 30s or just whatever.  But I said to her, I miss you a lot.  I miss being with you.  But I'm scared to try to start something up again because I don't want to hurt you.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Wow.  This is like, I don't know.  What's wrong with that?  Is that bad?  I don't know.  It's pretty rom-com-ish.  Yeah, guys don't really show their emotions like that.  It's rom-com without the com.  Right.  Just the fucking com. 
[02:57:00]  Just the rom-com.  Oh, my God.  But I said.  Wow.  I see a back-to-back poster in Joe DeRose's Future.  So she nurtured you in this apartment.  With dirty dishes in the background.  Like, huh?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Yes.  She nurtured you.  She nurtured me, yes.  Yeah, she nurtured me.  Anyway.  What a girl.  Yeah, it was versus saying I'm a misogynist, now I'm a girl.  God damn it.  You fuckers.  I see you.  It sounds like, let me say, I don't know, guys don't really show emotions like that. 
[02:57:30]  It's like a Dawson's Creek episode.  Well, which is it?  Is it clean the dishes or don't show emotions?  Honestly, I'm not even, I don't know.  Joe, I don't know.  The point is.  They both seem wrong.  We had that discussion and we just, I don't know.  Did you ever see Modern Romance with Albert Brooks?  No.  No.  But enough with Albert Brooks.  Tell us, what would you say to her if you could say something to her about your relationship?  Ah, very good question.  It's a fair question.  Jim's a very good interviewer.  What would I say to her right now?  If you could talk about your relationship, about the good things. 
[02:58:00]  I had a great time.  You're a smart kid.  And I wish it would have went better.  That's what I would say, honestly.  You say you're a smart kid.  That was a shitty joke that bombed.  I've said that.  Shit.  That's a big kid.  No, in all honesty, I would say, listen, I had an absolutely phenomenal fucking time with you.  I had a phenomenal two weeks.  Yeah, why would you cut it like that?  Sorry I brought up the dishes.  This is a whirlwind week. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  And in all honesty, I wish it worked out.  I wish we were still together.  I think I do, deep down in my heart.  I just get so confused with this shit, man.  I don't get that part with the...  You might want to go out with a housekeeper or something.  Man.  Like a cleaning lady.  Somebody that cleans?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  That appreciates a bag of meat when you give it to him?  Yeah.  I'll just fucking slough it off on the starving.  Oh, my God.  My cleaning lady would have loved a bag of meat. 
[02:59:00]  She wouldn't have gave it to a fucking junkie.  Really?  The young lady's not happy here.  The same one says, when someone starts a sentence with, I don't mean this to sound sexist, it's  going to be sexist.  He should just stick with prostitutes.  He doesn't sound like a very giving person.  Everything has a condition with this guy.  Wow.  That's from a woman.  Joe.  With a gun.  Hey, I can't say that that's not one of my flaws.  I have intimacy and commitment issues that stem from childhood.  Wow.  So, I absolutely think I have conditions that come along with things, but it's out of self-preservation. 
[02:59:30]  It's out of fear of getting hurt.  That's all.  Did you know, when you mentioned that she didn't help you clean up, that that was going to  make a problem?  Before you even open your mouth.  Great question.  Or in the middle of saying it, you're like, uh-oh, I'm making a problem.  Now, you knew before you even said it.  You're getting in your own way.  I knew it, Bob.  As it was happening, it was sticking in my crawl, and I was like, this is going to irk  me.  This is going to irk.  But here's the thing, dude.  Were you ever mad at a woman for not doing... 
[03:00:00]  I can't even fathom that.  I'm stunned when they get up to fucking do anything, but it doesn't bother me.  I'm just like, leave it there.  I don't fucking care.  But Joe cares.  But do you have...  Jimmy cares.  It'll get cleaned up.  I do.  Yeah.  Let me ask you this.  Go ahead, Joe.  And this is, again...  No, it's not going to be misogynistic or sexist, what I'm about to say.  But any time you talk about...  E-Rock is fucking on the turntables today.  Any time you talk about pulling weight, it sounds like you're going to be sexist, and 
[03:00:30]  I'm not.  Yeah.  You got to put yourself in my shoes for a second here.  Okay.  All right.  I'm just in a place...  What women do I get to kick with them?  Exactly.  And why are they bent?  Oh, kneeling in front of a trenning.  I hear you, Joe.  That's all right.  Did you buy her own apron after the first week of dating?  I got her, you know.  I got her the nice one with the embroidery on it.  No, but, I mean, here's the thing, dude.  It's like, the last ten years of my...  Okay, first of all, there's the adoption, there's all the intimacy issues, and crap that 
[03:01:00]  comes from that, okay?  And your childhood, and all the bullshit you got to work out in your own way, blah, blah,  fucking blah.  Yeah.  You smash that into the last ten years of my life has been struggling in this ridiculous  fucking business that I've picked for myself to be in.  Everything is fucking hand-to-mouth.  You're pinching pennies.  You're saving.  You're trying to make it work.  Everything is conditional.  Everything's volatile. 
[03:01:30]  Anything can go away at any minute.  And you become this, like, self-preserving unit that has to survive through all this.  And your fucking antennas go up all the time, constantly about, is this guy trying to fuck  me?  Is that guy screwing me on that deal?  Did I protect myself over here?  But you're describing everyone's life right there.  Yes.  That's everyone lives that life.  I'm not saying, I'm not saying, well, not everyone.  I think it's a little more amplified in the entertainment business. 
[03:02:00]  I think that's a fair, I think that's fair to say.  I don't know.  The backstabbing cubicle fucking sitting everywhere.  Cops got to deal with that shit, too, and on the job.  It's everywhere, Joe.  I know.  I'm not saying it doesn't exist at all.  You take yourself way too seriously.  Yeah.  I'm not saying it doesn't.  Fuck off.  I'm not saying it doesn't.  And what does that make you?  Joe, these are all jokes.  I swear to you.  I love you.  You know that.  I love you.  I just think it's hilarious you having your two dishes a week in. 
[03:02:30]  I'm not saying it doesn't exist at all in anybody else's work environment.  I'm saying, but it's a little more amplified with pursuing comedy when you don't even have  the nine-to-five stability.  Everything is up in the air all the time.  So why wouldn't you like to have somebody that's around that's fun and treat them like,  like, you know.  I'm not saying I'm not flawed in this.  I'm not saying I didn't make mistakes.  What I'm saying is, is that my environment has worsened my flaws.  Yeah.  And it makes my antennas go up and it makes me like, are you screwing me? 
[03:03:00]  What's going on here?  And I get a little crazy about it.  I get crazy about it.  And it's something that I'm working on, but it has fucked me up with relationships because  I have trust issues.  And then all of that snowballs and turns into something as stupid as, you didn't help me  pick up the dishes, which means you don't appreciate what I'm trying to do for you.  You don't appreciate this.  You don't appreciate it.  It's snowballing.  I get all that. 
[03:03:30]  That's all.  But I think Anthony had the best question so far here.  What's that?  Did you know that you were going down a bad road?  All guys bite their tongue and go like, oh, I would love to say this in a relationship.  You're like, uh, I'm not because I know this will be a problem.  Sometimes you can't help yourself and you snap a little bit, but you had to know bringing  up this dumb dish thing was going to cause some major fucking problems.  Yeah, I knew.  And you couldn't hold it in at that moment?  I brought it up.  Especially knowing that you had an important gig to do that night? 
[03:04:00]  No, no, no.  We didn't.  It didn't happen right then.  No, no.  It was the next day.  He saved it until the junkie thing.  Oh, it ate you.  And it ate at you for a while.  Guys, I handled it the best way possible.  I harbored it for a few days.  Let it age like fine wine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Do you also start the arguments right before she's trying to go to bed?  You think like a girl, I think.  I am very, I'll be the first woman, I am very effeminate when it comes to arguments. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  I argue very much.  The bitchy side.  I get very, yeah, like bitchy.  And like, when I watch that movie, The Breakup, and they fight about the dishes.  And he's like, who would want to do dishes?  And she's like, don't you get it?  I just want you to help me.  I agree with Jennifer Addison through the whole argument.  Oh, wow.  I'm like, he's being a dick.  He's an asshole.  Get up and do the dishes.  Because I think of my roommates that have been like that.  And it drives me crazy.  He's obsessed with dishes. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, I get it.  It's weird.  I'm usually the more womanly person in my relationship.  Paper plates were made for you, man.  You know who would fucking...  Paper plates and cups.  Joe, you know who would dig you and who you would have a fucking great time with?  The entire cast of Rent.  Martha Stewart.  Oh, fuck it.  Right.  Someone your own age or older.  You're not fucking cut out for young girls.  You can't date younger chicks.  You can't.  Because they are going to sit there while the fucking dishes, and you honestly can't give  a shit.  You can't look and go, I'm not going to say anything, but I'm pissed. 
[03:05:30]  You honestly don't have to give a shit.  I don't give a shit how many plates are out.  I'd put a Ferris wheel in my yard if I could.  Now, fun, fun, fun at Anthony's house.  No washy dishy here.  Unfortunately, none of the girls would be tall enough to ride it.  You know, Chris, it's six.  Were you at the Neverland...  It was at the Neverland auction.  Yes.  At the county auction.  I'll take that.  Can I buy some zebras and...  How much for that llama? 
[03:06:00]  You need a woman.  You know why?  A woman your age would have gotten up off that spread out cellulite ass and fucking  picked up those dishes and helped you.  Meanwhile, you get a girl with a snare drum ass and you're giving her shit.  Now, I think you have a great point.  Now, let me ask you this.  Are you in a committed relationship right now?  Are you...  Yes.  You have a girlfriend right now?  Okay.  Now what?  No, no, I'm not judging you.  Just relax. 
[03:06:30]  I was going to ask you this.  Yeah.  Don't you think it's easier if you're...  Now, I'm not saying you can't be in a committed relationship with a younger girl, but I'm saying  don't you find it a little easier when you're in a more fun, carefree, not committed relationship  with a younger girl than something that starts to require a little more seriousness?  Would you agree with that?  Well, I think once you move in with someone or even seeing each other every day, a commitment 
[03:07:00]  to see each other every day, like it's expected.  Right.  Shit like that with no real time for yourself.  Yeah, that'll get crazy.  But that's with anybody.  Fucking old or broad would be even worse.  That's with anybody.  So when I say we had communication issues, that's basically what it comes down to is  that I rushed fucking 90 miles per hour head on into a relationship with a girl that was  younger than me without thinking about, oh, we got to build up to this stuff because there's,  you know...  You're looking for your mommy. 
[03:07:30]  I know.  You're looking for your mommy and you knew damn well she was never going to do the fucking  dishes and that bothered you because you're like, fuck, I really like her, but she has  to be my mommy too.  Mommy, can you hear me?  Yeah.  I'm serious.  No, I know.  You're looking for someone that's going to keep a good house.  That's why I bring up the adoption thing.  Look, I keep a good house.  I'm crazy fucking neat and clean.  I put everything away when I'm done using it.  I can't stand clutter.  I can't stand disorganized.  It's a place for everything and everything in its place. 
[03:08:00]  Except for your penis.  The place is your hand right now.  So I'm like that.  So I, of course, I'd like to be with somebody that's like that because I don't...  That means there's a lot of things in your life you just can't control, Joe.  Oh, it's...  It's...  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  I know.  You're absolutely right.  And I'm bad.  That's why I'm in therapy.  My therapist now is trying to help me with like, dude, accept what you don't control.  Accept that.  You have to learn how to accept that. 
[03:08:30]  Where does that come from?  Being adopted?  Control issues?  Fucking Iraq's killing it.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  That's what I'm doing.  Oh, Bob!  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Where's it come from?  It comes from...  Being adopted?  I was...  I know other people that were adopted and they're well-adjusted.  Well, I think when you're adopted, there's an organic abandonment issue that comes along 
[03:09:00]  with that.  Whether you realize it's there or not, it's there.  Okay.  Then, excuse me, you also get some intimacy issues out of that because, you know, these  people that were literally your life court supply got rid of you.  Oh, boy.  So are people going to abandon me?  Can I not get intimate with people?  Oh, we can do the adoption stuff, right?  Why can't you just take that as a one-off?  It happened in your life with those people, but then everyone else in your life doesn't  necessarily have to follow suit.  And trust me when I tell you I thought that's how I felt about it for a long time, and it 
[03:09:30]  wasn't until an undeniable thing in me was going, no, asshole, this is fucking happening  in your head right now.  It was...  I couldn't turn my back on it anymore.  Trust me.  I was that callous and, like, candid about it.  Well, why can't you look at it as your biological mom was thinking, I'm really going to just give  this kid a much better life than I could give him.  I try...  Maybe that's just tough to try to fucking wrap your head around.  No, I felt like that for years.  Because a lot of people that, you know, give up their kids for adoption, that's exactly 
[03:10:00]  what they're thinking.  But it's basically, how could she have no interest in you is what you're thinking.  How could she have zero interest in what you've turned out to be?  That's where it starts to come up.  My therapist said to me, she goes, you know, when people who have blood relation, she said,  you get a certain feeling when you're around somebody that you have a blood relation to.  She said, even if you don't hang out with that person a lot or whatever, have a ton  in common, there is a sense of home when you get around them.  It's a very, like, organic, biological thing that happens.  She goes, you don't have that with anybody in your life.  Because you don't know one person that you have blood relation to. 
[03:10:30]  Literally none.  And she goes, and that causes a lot of these problems.  And for years, I was like, I don't give a shit.  Whatever.  But it's like a volcano.  You can live next to it for years and go, it's just a fucking mountain.  It's fine.  But eventually when it erupts, you can't ignore it anymore.  What do you know about your real mom and dad?  I know that one was Egyptian, one was Italian.  I know that my mother apparently was, I think, in med school, I think.  I know that they were most likely immigrants or visiting or something like that along those 
[03:11:00]  lines here.  And that it all happened in Philly.  That's basically right now.  Oh, boy.  So could you trace them back and find them?  I'm in the process of trying to do that right now.  Okay.  But I'm trying to find a service.  Actually, for anybody listening, if anybody has, like, service or something, you can put  me in the direction.  Because I'm looking online now, and everything is like, you know, a lot of the websites are  like, you know, it costs a lot, and they don't guarantee, and it's kind of a rip-off.  I can find them for you. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's do it.  Let's get the streets together.  Let's go on a road trip.  Let's find these people.  God, I'd love to go all around.  So, you know, but, so anyway, you couple the-  What do you want to ask them?  I'm sorry, Joe.  No, no.  What would you ask your mom if you met her?  Like, that's interesting to me, because I was an adopted.  So what would you like to know the most?  Why the fuck did you give me up for adoption, right?  Of course, I'd like to know the story of why it happened, but truth be told, if I had to  pick, you know, if I was only allowed to ask a few questions, the things I really want 
[03:12:00]  to know are, A, what's my, like, health and medical history?  Is there a history of heart disease, cancer, that sort of thing?  B, do I have siblings?  Like, do I have brothers and sisters out there somewhere?  And C, why do I like meat so much?  Muslim Brotherhood over in Egypt.  Yeah, why, those things to me are much more clues into who I am versus, like, hey, we  were broke, so we gave you up.  It's like, obviously, there was, like, some financial or whatever issue.  But your parents were cool to you?  They didn't mistreat you or anything, right? 
[03:12:30]  My parents are great.  They're great, right?  My parents are great, but you've got to understand something.  My adoptive parents, wonderful people, man.  I owe them everything.  But they also were very overprotective.  You know, when two people can't have a kid, and then they get, like, what they perceive  as this blessing come into their life, like, with this adoption.  You know, my parents are religious, too, so to them it was literally, like, a miracle.  You know, they're a little, there's some smothering that goes on. 
[03:13:00]  So you tie that into the abandonment and intimacy issues, your trust shit just starts getting  fucked up, man.  Yeah.  Do they not want you to find your real mom and dad?  No, they're 100% supportive of it.  100% supportive of it.  Fucking gold star for E-Rock today.  Yeah, no, they're 100% supportive of it.  Yeah.  But it hurts me a little bit to say to them, hey, mom, where at the hospital was I born  in?  Because I'm starting the search now.  You know, it's like, it just, she wouldn't, she'd be really supportive. 
[03:13:30]  It just makes me feel bad.  So ask her casually.  See, I'm doing a bit, but I don't want to make it in the wrong hospital.  Is it St. Joseph's?  No.  Right, I'm doing a bit.  Was I born in St. Anne's, the Unloved?  Do you have the exact date of the adoption again?  It's for the bit.  Interesting.  Yeah.  So it's, you know, it's, but anyway, so all these things, and then you fucking hop it  all into the comedy business.  But she broke up with you.  She started the conversation, but it was a very mutual breakup. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  It was very mutual.  In fact, I said to her at one point, I go, technically, you're breaking up with me, and  she's like, like, we were kind of joking at the end of it.  And she was like, no, I did not.  This was very mutual.  Huh.  But, uh.  She lets her off easy.  Another communicate from the lady.  Yes.  Oh, let's just say.  A woman, you know, she's in her mid-30s, and she says, she can't believe you asked that.  She goes, cut out for young girls.  They are his only hope.  A woman my age wouldn't put up with his shit for a second.  She likes to think that, but that's not true at all.  Yeah, it's not. 
[03:14:30]  The older broad would be right there.  You know what?  She'd fucking pick up those goddamn dishes.  Yes.  It's not.  In fact, she, this older chick, as we're referring to her, she should, I think, have a little  more of a grasp on what I'm saying right now.  I don't think, I don't think, as we continue to discuss this, I don't think anything I'm saying  is crazy outlandish.  I'm admitting my flaws and saying, look, I know I fucked up, but I'm trying to work  it out.  You know, what kind of person goes, oh, go fuck yourself, then?  Then go bang a 19-year-old.  Okay, thanks. 
[03:15:00]  You're a great human being.  Congratulations.  A woman my age wouldn't put up with that shit.  Shut it.  I know.  You would, too.  Shut it, yeah.  More so than a young girl would.  Enough.  Exactly.  Who's alone in texting right now, by the way?  Fucking blow me.  Uh-oh.  Another good E-Rock choice, by the way.  Yes, Jimmy.  You know the hospital you were born in?  That's all I need to know.  My mom knows, and I have to, I could get that information. 
[03:15:30]  She still hasn't told you?  No, no.  She told me.  I just, I never remember the name of it.  I know a lot of people that work in hospitals, brother.  When Joe says, if you think I'm kidding, I could get this fucking done for you.  How much you got?  It's going to cost you a couple bucks.  Wow.  What's it cost?  I'm all about pocket money these days.  Yeah?  Yeah, throw me a little pocket money.  A little jingle for you, Gene.  A little jingle?  We need to find out the hospital, and I think we can get this done today.  When you say, what hospital was I born in?  It's an optimal that just says why, and then breaks down into tears.  Oh, man.  Where are you going, Joseph? 
[03:16:00]  She starts punching the dough for the birthday cake she's making.  He's calling me Joseph.  What do you picture them being?  What do you mean?  Your birth parents.  Like in life, like as people?  What do you see in your mind?  Because, like, obviously, you got-  The mom is stirring a big thing of sauce.  Right.  And, like, hey, and the father's like, hold on, what book?  Hold on, what book?  Hold on, what book?  In Italian and in Egyptian.  That's pretty wild. 
[03:16:30]  You just see this fucking caricature of people.  He never had a chance.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, that's basically what I picture.  They're eating meatball sandwiches and that fucking flatbread.  Yeah, fucking Egyptian pocket bread.  Honestly, what I always picture is-  He's bringing severed heads home for the sauce.  The father's a bomb belt manufacturer.  And his son's just a bomb manufacturer.  Oh, wow.  Yeah. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Glad you didn't come here to feel good about yourself.  I think the first thing my dad is going to say to me is, you don't believe?  Oh, no.  What do you picture in your head, for real?  I picture Molaram.  That's what I picture.  I picture a guy with a red tattoo on his head.  That's what I was quoting.  I know, that's hilarious.  That's just the name.  Molaram.  My brother's going to be in the corner going, then you go into the dark sleep for the carnivore. 
[03:17:30]  The dark sleep.  You think you got like biological siblings out there?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Honestly, what I picture is, I always picture it being that the mom, that they're not married anymore.  And it's the mom, and she's done pretty well for herself, and there might be a sibling or two.  That's always how I picture it.  Not like they're loaded, but she did all right.  It's easy to say, because I wasn't adopted, but I would have to know. 
[03:18:00]  I would have to just know.  I didn't get to that point until, I don't know, maybe two years ago is when that started to rumble.  And now it's at a point where I go, I really need to figure this out, because it's stunting me.  It's stunting me in my life.  It's like there's a big question.  My therapist goes, there's a huge question mark at the starting point of your life.  She goes, you don't think that's not going to fuck with your head?  It's like, yeah, I guess that's an excellent point.  Yeah, but, you know. 
[03:18:30]  This guy was adopted.  He's got to fucking deal with it.  I'm trying to.  I'm trying to.  Hold on, hold on.  You've got to ramp into it.  Ronnie in Texas was adopted, and he doesn't agree with your therapist.  Go ahead, Ronnie.  Not in the least.  I don't.  I mean, just think about all the connections that you have with people that you grew up with that aren't your blood kin.  And I don't like the idea that your therapist put the idea in your head that you can't establish a bond with someone that you're not blood kin to.  Well, Ronnie. 
[03:19:00]  I think that's the root of.  And plus, when you find your birth parents, I don't like the word real parents.  I like birth parents.  Do you?  What kind of words?  Semantics.  Every group has their language.  I like real parents.  I don't like real parents.  Joe's parents are fake.  I like birth parents.  I call my adoptive parents fakers.  You don't do that?  Fake parents.  The cum donor we call the real dad.  You're just going to get disappointed because the real answer is exactly what you thought it was going to be. 
[03:19:30]  I call them throw me away.  Which is what?  Toss me aside.  Yes.  Which is what, Ronnie?  You were a mistake that they had a, you know.  At that point in their life, they just couldn't handle a kid.  They just didn't want one.  Yeah, and then you look at everyone else that couldn't handle or support a kid or that, and managed to anyway, and must think like, fuck, why couldn't these fuckers pull it together?  Sure.  I don't hate them for what they did. 
[03:20:00]  Look, I could have been splattered across the fucking metal tray.  You know what I mean?  Like, it could have been a lot worse.  Oh, my God, Joe.  That is true.  But who would clean that up?  Some fucking back alley Puerto Rican doctor.  Oh, man.  I hope they would clean all the utensils after your abortion.  Yeah, I mean, look, it could have been worse, man.  It could have been a lot worse.  So I don't resent them in any way for, there's no anger in my heart at all about what they did.  There's not even any sadness about it.  It's just like, I'd like to see what's up.  And look, for every negative thing you could say about it, and I can't believe I'm saying, look at the positive after the years of fucking pissing and moaning I've done in this room. 
[03:20:30]  But my point is, is like, the positive side to what you're saying, you know, is I could meet them and I could have this whole new set of wonderful people in my life that answer a lot of questions.  Sorry, I'm laughing at the E-Roc.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  So it could go either way.  But saying, what if I find them and they're assholes or it goes wrong or they say, get the fuck out, that's a fear-based decision. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  That's a decision out of fear.  Well, what if it's terrible?  You know, I worried for years that I'd find them in some fucking marketplace with a pet monkey that they taught to steal apples for.  To make up for the one they gave up.  All right, Ronnie.  Thanks for the call there, buddy.  Oh, my God.  All right. 
[03:21:30]  Well, Joe, good luck with that.  Would you be hurt if you finally met them and said, why did you do that?  And they just said, we looked at you and you were homely.  Oh, shit.  We had better hopes.  Why do we do it?  Look at you.  I so care about you as long as it's before 10 a.m.  Oh, wow.  Oh, jeez.  This therapy session.  We're going to have to call it.  All right.  We could pick up for our next week.  Yeah, exactly.  Pick up for our next week.  Oh, you know, guys.  I like that we get into these things. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, I really do.  Joe, I love getting into the human psyche.  I haven't seen you in a while.  I was excited for you because you were a different person when you had this girl.  Yeah.  She's, you know, look.  I was excited for you.  But you seem different in a good way today.  Well, let me.  The one positive that came out of this is HIV.  Exactly.  She won't be too damaged.  I bought a dishwasher.  Yeah, really.  Fucking get a dishwasher and keep your relationships together. 
[03:22:30]  Exactly.  Fucking as old a maid motherfucker.  Fucking chiseler.  Washes dishes by hand at this point.  Yeah, well, you think if I got to afford a dishwasher, some of these fucking issues wouldn't be on the table right now?  If you're banging Ann B. Davis, you wouldn't get into as many arguments.  Exactly, you skin flint.  Fucking, you got a cute girl there.  She's a fucking eight and a half, you pinch penny.  Fucking, he needs a maid.  He needs someone that's going to get up.  Yeah.  I want to take a picture of that.  I'm going to send her that picture.  How about you leave her alone?  She'll think that's really funny. 
[03:23:00]  Exactly.  Let her be happy.  Yeah, yeah, really.  Move on, Joe.  I'm going to send her that picture.  Right, great.  No, no, she'll think it's, we're friendly.  We're fine.  We're on good terms.  We're on good terms.  So you send her that, she sends you the restraining order.  Exactly.  She gives a polite LOL when he tests her fun things.  Had a really good taping.  Oh, good, LOL.  By the way, here's my new boyfriend's cock.  Oh, fuck.  Exactly.  And you're like, oh, no.  It looks like a negative of my cock.  Oh, no. 
[03:23:30]  It's not a hard one.  Negative.  She's in a really messy apartment right now having the time of her life.  Exactly.  Being fucked so well, she's drooling on the pillow.  I'm not realizing it.  Baby.  I don't mean that.  Oh, Joe.  Baby, baby, put them plates down.  That's all right.  Put them plates down.  Get some loving, baby.  Exactly.  You don't need to clean that shit up.  Let me fuck you again.  Some black guy with socks is deep digging her with his fucking socks on.  Yeah, she's with a guy. 
[03:24:00]  When she gets up from the bed, he just looks at her and goes, mm, like that.  Just one of those, like, mm.  Does that bother you she might be with somebody else now?  Of course it fucking bothers me.  Of course it should, too.  Of course.  That's a guy's thing, right?  Bothers you.  Bothers me terribly, man.  The telltale slap of black thighs on the white one.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Oh, that's terrible.  Well, Joe, you start your tour tomorrow, huh?  Tour starts tomorrow.  Well, it starts Thursday. 
[03:24:30]  It's Laughing Skull in Atlanta, Georgia.  This weekend, April 4th through 7th, I'm recording my brand new comedy album.  Please come out for that.  It's going to be great.  And then after that, I'm touring all through the South, Asheville, North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas, everywhere, Mississippi.  Come out for that.  Go to JoeDarosaComedy.com for dates.  Please come out.  Fuck it, you rocked.  I would have went with waiting for a girl like you.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Jimmy? 
[03:25:00]  Caroline's.  Not this.  Next weekend, right?  Yeah, April 11th through 15.  Caroline's.  Yeah.  I know 11th through 14.  And I also have a bunch of other dates coming up.  But Stress Factory Memorial Day weekend's a big one.  My first Stress Factory date in a long time.  Nice.  I'm only touring for a couple more months, and then I'm taking time off to start the new material.  Because the special airs at the end of June or in July.  Very cool.  So once that's about to air, I'm done with doing dates for six or eight months.  Jimmy taped a great one in Boston.  Yeah, I heard it was awesome, man.  Yeah, I was happy with it.  Awesome.  All right. 
[03:25:30]  You might continue with Sam, I guess.  Yeah, I'm going to hang out with Sam for a little while.  Might as well.  We worked through this thing, Sam.  Now, there's a guy.  I think we should talk about it more.  There's a guy.  How long have you been married now?  It was in June.  So it was seven months.  Seven months, about.  And how long were you going out before that?  Seven years.  Seven years.  And you know what?  Wow.  Still like the first day they ever met in love, these two.  Exactly.  Still wears a condom.  Wears pajamas.  Eats little baby food. 
[03:26:00]  Exactly.  Eats in a high chair.  Has his fucking pubes in a fucking Tupperware dish.  His wife is still disgusted at his dumb wrestling action figures like she was the first day  she met him.  We're blissfully happy together.  Oh, brother.  Yeah.  Squinting at that little TV in the room.  It's awful.  Oh, God.  Such a juxtaposition from this wonderful place.  This is true.  We all have our very unique problems, don't we?  Don't we?  We all need an escape.  Exactly.  We're all fucking insane.  All right, DeRosa.  What are you going to do, you know?  What are you going to do? 
[03:26:30]  But we're better for it, guys.  You know, it builds you the person you are.  It builds character.  It builds character.  The trials and tribulations.  It builds fucking...  It builds concrete walls 20 feet thick between you and relationships.  Like relationships are nuclear.  You need to protect it.  I need lead-lined fucking cinder block walls.  Oh, they're scrubbing you with those brooms.  Yes.  The fucking...  Yeah.  The silkwood shower.  Joe.  Hey, look. 
[03:27:00]  Wait.  Oh, the girl just said she wants to get back together.  Serious XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  Joe, you feel good?  You feel like you got a lot off your chest today?  You know, I do.  You do?  I do feel good. 
[03:27:30]  But I really miss her right now.  I'll tell you that.  The girl we were...  Oh, God, yeah.  Were you thinking it was a mistake?  You know, Sam, I don't know.  Like, I got made fun of when I said this.  Obviously.  Obviously.  Well, there wasn't much you could say that wasn't going to be made fun of today.  But I really meant what I said.  It's like I miss her terribly, and I still want to be with her, but I'm just afraid to  pursue that because I'm just like, I don't want to fuck it up again.  Like, I'm still trying to figure out my shit a little bit. 
[03:28:00]  You know what happens in relationships?  You want this relationship where somebody's just going to have your back all the time  and they're there for you.  But then when you also have to do the give part, like, it's give and take.  And the take part is great.  But then when you realize you have to do the give part, you're like, oh, this sucks.  Right.  And then you don't want to do it, so you end it.  And then you're like, oh, fuck, I forgot about all the stuff I was taking.  That was great.  Yeah, yeah, that is true.  God, it's selfish.  Yeah, it is.  They shouldn't exist.  What?  Relationships?  Yeah.  Why?  I'm in a great relationship. 
[03:28:30]  I just mean, if you look at it scientifically, you know, or just by the numbers.  We're involved people with emotions.  Well, I mean, they're emotionally satisfying.  Evolved people, I think, would be able to accept human sexuality a little more than we do with all these things.  There are other factors that complicate these things.  That's what people say.  That's your way of saying, like, so I could fuck other chicks.  But, like, you'd be just as mad if you were fucking dudes when you weren't around.  Well, yeah.  So that means I am also not evolved. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  You see what I'm saying?  Right.  Like, it's, it's, it's, there, but it's not just this extra curricular sex stuff.  It's, it's, it's, there's a lot of things.  There's a, there's stuff happening in your body for most people that's causing your body to organically fight against this notion of being with this one person in this one environment or habitat, rather, all the time.  And we ignore it.  We just completely ignore it.  You know, no matter how many studies they do, no matter how much we go, you know, how much we evolve, how much we look back at history, how much we look at the invention of marriage and why it was invented. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  I mean, it's just, it's just what it is.  It's like, you know, it's way more like you live with your best friend.  Yes.  You know, versus, and I think that's what it comes down to.  And I have best friends that I go, I could live with this guy.  And I have close friends where I go, I couldn't live with this guy.  Yeah, but what about, like, you find your best friend who also is a female that you're attracted to? 
[03:30:00]  Well, that's the goal.  Right.  Yeah.  And that's what you get, I mean, yeah, that's what you got to look towards.  Right, exactly.  I guess, go ahead.  Yeah, no, I just, because I think the whole idea is that you have to hold yourself to the same standard that you hold this girl to, which is difficult because you want, you know what I mean?  Because you want certain things out of this girl.  Like, you want her to be able to stand up and say, you know what?  Let me help you with those dishes, Joe.  You got a big night ahead of you.  You're all nerves.  Let me help you with these dishes.  Right.  But then you have to know in your head that you would definitely do the same thing. 
[03:30:30]  And in most circumstances, you probably wouldn't.  Yeah, you're right.  You're absolutely right.  Like, you have to get there where you're okay doing what you want her to do as well.  I thought about, like, all the times where, like, I didn't ask her enough about herself.  She would ask me so much about my day.  Did you care?  Yeah, I cared.  Yeah.  But.  Not enough to ask?  That doesn't sound like you cared very much.  It's weird, man. 
[03:31:00]  It's not that I didn't care.  It's not a matter that.  It's just you get, you develop bad habits.  Yeah.  Which is what I was trying to say earlier.  And I wish I would have thought of saying those exact words.  But.  How could you have time to develop bad habits?  You were dating for a month and a half.  No, no, I don't mean, I don't mean in one particular relationship.  In general.  I mean in life.  Yeah.  You know, and it's, it, that, that sort of encompasses everything I was saying about you  start out here in childhood and then this happens as you're growing up and then you get this  kind of job and it affects you in this way. 
[03:31:30]  And then this, and the longer you go through this cyclical thing and the longer you're single  through it, you develop these really bad habits and you reinforce them.  And you, you, it's, you don't say, I don't care about her day.  You just don't think to ask about it because you've lived alone for so long.  Right.  It's never been a part of your day to do that.  Yeah.  You got to be aware when stuff like that's going on and like just constantly be breaking  yourself of bad habits.  Like just this weekend I was sitting there and I talk about everybody who I work with, 
[03:32:00]  with Jess, like, and she knows everybody.  Like she's met everybody and I'm like, oh, you rocked it the dumbest thing today.  We were making fun of him for that.  Or, you know, Troy said this today or blah, blah, blah.  And then like literally on Saturday, she was talking about one of her coworkers about  like, oh, she's been such a bitch since dah, dah, dah.  And I'm like, okay, yeah, you told me that.  Right.  And, and she looked at me like, you know, you talk about your coworkers all the time,  right?  Right.  Like, don't act like, you know, what I'm saying is bullshit just because it's not your coworkers.  And I was like, I like in my head, I'm going, yeah, but my coworkers are interesting. 
[03:32:30]  And I was like, no, my coworkers are not interesting.  They're just people I interact with.  So I'm like there, I'm like, okay, I got to remember to at least feign interest.  If I expect her to feign interest in my nonsense.  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  No, I agree with that.  Totally.  Here's the other thing though, is I think, I think if you're coming from the place of living  alone and somebody asks you about your day and you kind of go on about it, I don't think  that's necessarily you saying I'm interested in my bullshit. 
[03:33:00]  So I'm going to talk about it.  I think it's just, it's like somebody's coming into your day and opening the lock on the chest  of shit happening in your head because you didn't have anybody to talk to about it before.  You're doing that.  You're all the shit you're spewing out on her.  Well, I talked to my manager and he thinks this might happen.  So that could be good.  But then I was thinking, what if this happens?  And then, you know, I'm working on this thing on my computer and it's not, and I can't crack  this story.  I'm trying to write the script.  That's all going on in my fucking head. 
[03:33:30]  And then she just goes, Hey, can I open this, the lid on this thing?  Right.  And you're a talker.  I mean, I think that's obvious to everybody that you like to express what's going on.  Shut my fucking mouth once in a while.  Yeah, you need to realize, maybe you can just figure out your shit.  You don't have to agree with me, Sam.  Well, I'm just saying.  You go home and you figure out your own shit.  And then it's like, maybe we don't need to have a conversation about some bullshit that  you already know the answer to.  Yeah.  You just want somebody else to tell you so you don't have to be like, all right, I got  to stop fucking around.  You want to hear the thing that she did that was like one of the most like beautiful? 
[03:34:00]  This was the thing that killed me.  See, this is the thing now.  So you're missing and you're thinking of all the wonderful things that she brought  to your life.  This is the one that killed me.  She, I was trying to do that like plant-based diet.  She told me one day, she goes, Hey, I have some restaurants to tell you about that like  they're like vegan and vegetarian, but they're heartier meals.  So they'll be more satisfying, whatever.  And I was like, okay, cool.  Yeah, whatever.  We'll talk about it later. 
[03:34:30]  I didn't even think about it when she said it.  And then, uh, we have her, her manager is also my manager, not for comedy, but for my  music that I do.  So I was talking to him, which by the way, you got to fix your website because right  now you got on your website, it says Joe's podcast, Joe's band one after the other two  dead links.  Yeah.  Those websites are dead.  Yeah.  That's, that's some bullshit.  You can't have that on your website.  Yeah, I know.  We need new websites for that stuff.  Right.  All right.  Go on.  But the important thing on the website is the shows, the shows, of course, comedy.com 
[03:35:00]  for the shows that you will die tour starting this week in Atlanta, Georgia, with the recording  of the album.  Right.  Anyway, um, so we have the same manager for partial stuff or whatever.  And, um, I was talking to him and he didn't know we broke up and he goes, yeah, uh, she  emailed me, uh, asking me, uh, about cause he's vegan.  And she emailed me about, uh, some vegan restaurants for you. 
[03:35:30]  I was like, what?  And he was like, yeah, she emailed me like Joe's trying to do this thing and I want to  find some places that he can eat.  She's not vegan.  No.  It was like one of the sweetest things.  And I was like, dude, that killed me.  I was like, she went out of her way.  I was just like, you're such a piece of shit.  Right.  Because you would, you would never have done anything that nice for her though.  No, I would have.  Would you really?  Or do you just think now you would have?  In between meetings, in between meetings on Valentine's day.  Yeah.  When I was so stressed out.  Yeah.  I stood in line for 20 minutes at the Disney store to buy her a Tigger stuff down. 
[03:36:00]  Well, she loves tigers.  I mean, I guess that's nice.  You could have done it the day before Valentine's day though and have that all figured out.  I couldn't.  I don't remember why, but I couldn't.  There was a reason why.  But you know, I'm not saying I never did anything nice for the girl.  You think you'd, but did you treat her as well as, hey, maybe that's the other thing.  Because like to express, like for me, I don't express that much.  I don't go home and like spew about everything.  Like I said, I talk about some goofy shit that my coworkers do because there's always a good 
[03:36:30]  E-Rock story to tell.  I'm entertaining.  Yeah.  E-Rock's a very entertaining guy.  There's always something, you know, I'll update her on how miserable Sal's life is becoming  because he's taken so much shit at the office.  Because, you know, she's seen Sal from when he was an intern and he was just like a nice  little young go-getter.  And now he's this out of the closet gay guy.  Right.  Exactly.  Out of the closet eating shit and enjoying it.  Right.  And so that's an interesting little thing.  But I don't express like, oh, I got to talk about this and get this off my chest and blah, 
[03:37:00]  blah, blah.  I feel like it's a very feminine thing.  You think that maybe she was like, I don't really need to be dating like a girl.  I don't know, man.  Like the fact that you can't really handle your, I feel like you can't handle your emotions.  Look, I'm half, I'm half gay.  Yeah.  So I think I need a chick who's a half lesbian.  And I think that we'd make a nice couple.  Or just a chick with a dick.  I mean, I've never been more comfortable with the idea that I would blow a tranny.  Than right now. 
[03:37:30]  Than just in these last few months, to be honest with you.  Really?  The more trannies that follow me on Twitter, due to my outspoken support of my dear friend  Bailey J.  Of the community.  I've actually got some new followers and stuff.  And you just sat there and said, I think it's like living with your best friend.  Like there's some guys that I would live with.  So you're looking for, like you want to see some titties.  You want it to smell like a girl.  You want maybe some makeup on.  Right.  But you need a man in your life. 
[03:38:00]  I like a vagina.  And I think I've missed having that vagina around here.  But would the asshole suffice?  Nah, I don't know.  I think about that a lot.  I don't know if it would.  You think about that from time to time.  I don't know if it would.  I don't know if it's enough.  It might be.  Yeah.  It could be.  There's a porno called, Your Asshole Is Not Enough.  That's the story of Joe DeRosa.  I want it to be.  No, it's a real porno.  Yeah.  Which, I don't know what it's about.  Is it a James Bond parody?  That's what I always thought it must be, right? 
[03:38:30]  That sounds like such a James Bond title.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you need at least somebody with male emotions.  You know what I mean?  You need a point-counterpoint.  Jess, very emotional girl.  She cries during movies and gets upset about things and gets angry and expresses things.  And me?  You know me, Joe.  I'm a lot like John Wayne.  The strong, silent type.  Yeah, you're a man's man.  Right, right.  We all say that about you. 
[03:39:00]  When I'm not around?  Yeah.  That's cool.  We all say Sam.  That Sam is a man's man.  That's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  You need at least a girl with a manly personality just to offset the feminism of your day-to-day.  I think Ant said it today.  I don't think I need a manly personality, but Ant hit it on the head when he goes, you want your mom?  Right.  Or did Opi or Jimmy?  Somebody said it.  One of the three people that wasn't me in this room said that today.  Which is like you need, you're not going to be the alpha in the relationship. 
[03:39:30]  I'll be the alpha, but I'm only the alpha in certain places.  Yeah.  I still need that nurturing, whatever you want to call it.  And I think Ant had a good point.  I know he said this when he goes, you probably need to date a girl that's older.  My therapist said that too.  I've quoted my therapist eight times today, but she said that too.  She's like, I think you might need somebody that's maybe a little under the 30s, has a little more battle damage. 
[03:40:00]  You know, like, you know, it's that just kind of understands a little more where you're coming from.  Because I don't like you out.  You got to figure out your shit on your own.  Because much like ONA did, much like your therapist does, your time's up here.  I'm sorry to say it, but this is just the way it goes sometimes.  What is your guest here?  My guest is Michelle Beatles here.  And this was kind of me and you.  Is that her?  That's her.  She's hot.  Which is why I don't need you in here.  You know what I mean?  Mucking things up.  Well, wait, she might be single in her 30s.  She's good. 
[03:40:30]  She's good.  Hi.  Michelle.  Hi.  Welcome.  Sit down.  I was just kicking Joe DeRosa out.  Oh, that sucks.  Yeah, well, you're here.  You're here.  I know.  Welcome to the show.  Yeah.  Joe was just griping about he's single and he's very feminine.  Are you?  Why are you griping?  I just, I went through a breakup.  How long ago?  A couple weeks.  Nah, you're fresh.  This is the time.  But I was, I've been dating a lot of women in their 20s and I think I need to stop doing 
[03:41:00]  that.  How old are you?  I'm 35.  Don't ask, don't ask too many questions.  He's a talker.  Make it the abridged version of DeRosa.  No, no, no.  Even mid to late.  I kept upping my cutoff age and now I'm up to the point where I'm like, I think I just  got to jump into the 30s.  I keep.  Don't be afraid of the 30s.  We're pretty awesome.  I'm not afraid of it.  We're wise.  I just don't meet a lot of girls in their 30s.  I meet a lot of girls in their 20s, you know?  It's because you meet girls that don't have their shit together.  These girls in their 30s, my wife's 29, but she'll be 30.  Well, where do you meet a girl with their shit together?  I only meet girls at the comedy shows, you know?  Well, you gotta get out. 
[03:41:30]  Expand your horizons.  Yeah, it's easy to get out and meet a 30-year-old professional when you work Friday and Saturday  nights till 1 a.m.  That's a good point.  Yeah, you know?  Ah, it's a trap.  It's a dead end.  Anyway.  We're having a dialogue.  Can I plug this tour one more time?  Please plug it.  Guys, come on out.  My tour, JoeDeRosaComedy.com for dates April 4th through 7th.  It starts off in Atlanta, Georgia at the Laughing Skull recording my new album, You Will Die.  Please come see it.  It's a positive guy.  I can't see how you don't have a line of women waiting outside. 
[03:42:00]  You know?  Very awkward.  Chicks dig me, which is the weird part.  Do they?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the 20-year-olds.  But I want to, you know, I need...  You need a woman.  You need substance.  Yeah.  Are you doing like a nipple thing?  I think he was.  He was kind of tweaking, wasn't he?  Or money.  He wants somebody with money.  Yeah, some cash and nipples.  I just need a guy like this to follow me around with a camera so people take me serious.  Yeah, he came in with Michelle.  I know, right?  That was...  That was...  Not for you, Joe.  What do you charge? 
[03:42:30]  I'll take you around.  It's my brother, actually.  All right.  He's a struggling photographer.  I don't have a brother.  I gotta find my real parents.  He's adopted.  Jesus!  He shouldn't have brought it up.  He's got a lock on.  Joe, go figure your shit out.  I'm going out to Brooklyn.  I don't want you back here until you're solid.  Sam, I gotta be honest with you.  I don't really want to come back here.  This place doesn't help, that's it.  Well, it's this part of it, you know.  Yeah.  No, I had fun.  Thanks for having me, buddy.  Well, thank you for being here.  Oh, do I have to put these on?  You don't have to.  Okay, good.  I mean, as long as you can hear me, that's fine. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, I can hear you.  Michelle Beadle's here.  For those that don't know, a lot of people do know, though.  People were getting very excited when I posted on Twitter last night.  No, I saw one guy go, who?  Which I always love.  Well, yeah, you can't concentrate on that guy.  God, that guy doesn't know.  Now I need him to like me.  Yeah, but you have like 150,000 followers on Twitter.  Yeah, something.  That's a lot of people.  No, it's millions of people is what it is.  That's hundreds of thousands.  I mean, it's six figures, barely.  It's not even hundreds.  But if they all would send a dollar, can you imagine?  That's all I want.  You'd have like 150 grand.  It could take you for like a year.  It's like 750, you psychopath.  You do?  Yeah.  I'm bad with numbers. 
[03:43:30]  What are you confusing me with?  You have 750,000 followers?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  If they all sent me a dollar, and it's, you know, I don't think you can tax that.  You'd be, no, there's no way.  Send me a dollar.  Wow, you'd be like a millionaire.  Well, yeah, close.  I mean, after two years.  After two years, yeah, I totally would.  That's amazing.  How did you get 750,000 followers on Twitter?  Nicole.  I don't know.  Come in here.  Do you know Nicole Biggins?  Hi.  Oh, shit.  You replaced me with Beatles?  Oh, no.  Beatles got 750,000 followers on Twitter.  You replaced me with Beatles?  No, no chance. 
[03:44:00]  My husband just called me, and he wants to punch you in the face.  Yes.  And he wants to bang you.  She said, yes, we just met.  I'm not that good, though, so let him know.  I was like, Beatles coming in.  Yeah.  Yeah, Matt hates me right now.  He wants to punch you in the face.  Why does he want to punch me?  Because he loves Beatles.  So why would, we're starting a relationship here being Beatle.  Dies for her.  Aw.  Mark Zito?  That sounds really cute.  Actually, the reason I have Michelle's number, I was able to get her in here today, which,  by the way, you clearly haven't been famous for long, just giving your phone number out  like that.  No.  Yeah, I knew this.  No, you say that, but apparently I gave my number out like a Saturday ago. 
[03:44:30]  I must have been drinking, and I get this text from like a kid.  He's like, hey, you want to go grab that drink?  I'm like, I have no idea who this is.  See.  Wow, I did that.  You're a very intriguing figure to me, because I see the Twitter followers.  I go, 750,000.  She's got a lot of Twitter followers.  She's got a big television show.  Oh, huge.  She's got a reputation.  Massive.  She's famous.  Yes, super.  She started following me on Twitter.  Wow.  Randomly, right?  And so I go, oh my gosh, let me look into this check.  What's going on here?  But then, she didn't respond to my tweets. 
[03:45:00]  I didn't?  Nope.  Were they funny?  I was like, hey, we should talk about wrestling sometime.  That's not funny.  That's not funny.  And you were like, I'm not going to even address that you suggested that.  And so I'm like, I think it was on Friday, I said again, I tweeted to you and Maria Menounos.  Oh, yeah.  We're still working on her.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know her.  I don't know her either.  Well, he's got her number.  Zito just gets everybody's number.  If you host a Hollywood entertainment show, you give me your phone number.  That is how this works.  And Zito texted me and he goes, hey, you want Beagle? 
[03:45:30]  I got her phone number.  And he's like, yeah, she's not responding to my tweets ever.  You want her?  Like, she's just like a piece of meat.  But for the show, Nicole, we're professionals.  Nicole's husband, when we were at Super Bowl, sees her and goes, if you can introduce me to her,  I'll give you $1,000.  $1,000.  And I was like, all right.  And I just walked over.  And she's like, yeah, take my phone number.  Come by the bar.  And he was like, what the fuck?  He was like, I'm not really going to give you $1,000.  I mean, I love her and all.  No, that's a lot of money.  I got a brunch out of it.  You did.  We did buy you brunch.  Yeah.  In New Orleans. 
[03:46:00]  But it wasn't $1,000 brunch.  No, it was not.  That's a terrible deal.  So it would be offered $1,000.  Not going to negotiate.  So listen, so I'm walking down.  I was like, thinking about coming on the show today, actually, which I do sometimes.  I stop by.  And Sam was like, don't come by, because I've got another girl coming on.  Wow, dude.  Well, I mean.  Did tell me it was either.  Why can't we have two?  Because then I start feeling overpowered.  Oh, that's why.  You know, I don't need all the.  I'm afraid we would be catty.  But I could see you're insecure as a man.  A little feminine energy is good for me.  When it starts to get a lot, I start to get a little iffy. 
[03:46:30]  Like strong feminine.  Plus, you brought a girl in with you.  This is my chief of staff, Jenna.  Right.  Who's awesome.  I'm sure she is awesome.  Yeah.  But now there's a lot of girls in here.  And I've never been good with girls.  I mean, I would leave.  Believe it or not.  But my husband was like, you go.  No, no.  She's staying.  Well, she's going to be first mania.  She's going to edit the call being like, you want to go out to brunch this weekend?  And that's the other thing.  Like, I'm like, OK, we have Michelle Beadle in here.  All right.  This is a major media personality.  Who?  Who?  750,000.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Allegedly, I bought some of them, according to one of the blogs. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  No, I don't even know how.  I would.  But I don't know how.  You should buy some to get yourself to a million.  That's what I thought.  Because I do know people that did that early on.  Who?  Tell me one name.  No, I can't.  Why?  Because I don't know the person very well.  I just know.  Exactly.  What?  Are they going to be mad at you?  It's not like you're going to lose a friend.  No, I think they already hate me, so it doesn't really matter.  So then who is it?  Who do you think?  But I've heard of this.  People that got to a million early on in life, and you're thinking.  Sam, did you have to do your research?  There's like one person this could be.  Who is it?  Erin Andrews?  I don't know that person.  Oh, I know.  You don't even know who she is.  I know who she is. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, OK.  I don't really know her either.  Michelle Beadle is a giant wrestling figure.  I am.  He told me that last week, and I was a little disappointed, because I am not.  OK, but I woke up this morning with just this new lease on life, knowing that it was  mania week.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't know if you could say.  I feel like I'm just glowing from the inside.  Really?  You are.  There's a buzz.  I am so excited about it.  Yeah.  And it's here.  It's here.  It's in New York, New Jersey, as they've been saying.  They're all going to be amongst us all week.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You know who's going to be in here tomorrow? 
[03:48:00]  Who?  Michael Cole.  It.  Ew.  Well, I'm just saying.  What do you mean, Al?  That's the worst.  You have to get beyond the TV.  I mean, the guy, Michael Cole.  You know who's on the sports show with me?  Who?  Punk.  What?  When?  Three years I've wanted to have this guy on a show I was a part of, but ESPN would never  entertain the idea of having wrestlers on, unless it was The Rock.  And so for me, this is just, yeah.  When's he going to be on?  Tomorrow.  I think we'll tape at three-ish.  Oh, my God.  We'll be across the street.  I'll come.  Come on over.  Oh, look.  Now you're besties.  I told you I'm building a relationship.  Look at how quickly you forget it, Albie.  Well, she's got stuff going on. 
[03:48:30]  I know.  She's talking to CM Punk.  Well, no, this week only.  I mean, this will be the best week of my life, and then it will all go back to crap next  week.  Wait, did you watch it when you were a kid and stuff?  I actually got into it in my 20s.  I was waiting tables, and everyone I worked with watched.  I know.  And it was stone cold and all that stuff.  Yeah.  The beautiful thing about wrestling, and I think this is why people like soap operas, is  that you can take a 10-year break and come back.  I know.  And it's all still going on.  Is that what you did?  You took a break?  I did.  I took a 10-year break.  And you're coming back now?  I came back four years ago, I think.  That's weird, because now is a weird time to come back to. 
[03:49:00]  Do you not like it?  No, I like it.  I mean, please, wrestling is my life.  It always will be.  You would never take a break.  No, there's no breaks for me.  Do you only do WWE, or do you do everybody?  No, I mean, I'll look at what's going on with TNA, and I'll check out the indie shows.  Yeah.  But, you know, WWE is my heart.  It's a good product.  It's amazing.  I don't see what anybody says.  I know they make fun of us.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  This is what I was wondering.  What is more difficult as a sports reporter?  What's a bigger hurdle to get over?  Yeah.  Being a woman, or being a fan of professional wrestling? 
[03:49:30]  Oh, definitely being a wrestling fan.  That's what I thought.  Totally.  Because then I watched the YouTube clips, and they're just giving you shit for being, like,  they're just like, you like wrestling, right?  They call me a loser.  Well, because Colin Cowherd used to call us all booger eaters, and we lived in our mom's  basements.  Booger eaters.  Which, you know, is fine.  I'm sure there's a small portion that probably do do those things.  It's probably a larger portion than you think.  Probably is.  But I also, you know, it's fun.  It's entertaining me.  I go to the movies for the same reason, to be entertained and disappear for a couple  hours from my brain.  And, you know, I love it. 
[03:50:00]  It's tough.  What do you think of The Rock going around?  So The Rock is the WWE champion.  Yeah.  And he's defending that title at WrestleMania.  Yeah.  However, he's been going on these shows.  He's been going on The Tonight Show.  He's a good deal.  He's been going on GMA.  He's been going on all these shows.  No championship belt.  No.  No mention of WrestleMania.  I can't believe it.  Pippin' the G.I. Joe.  What's your thoughts?  He's a tricky one, The Rock.  He's one of those people that comes around every once in a while and just can do whatever  he wants and is good at it. 
[03:50:30]  But it does bum me out that he doesn't talk about it more.  I mean, I get that he lives basically two different lives and he's an actor, rock star  on this one side, and now he's the wrestling.  But it would be nice if he mentioned it a little bit more, especially since here we are  a few, six days away.  That's what I'm saying.  And they're going to put the belt on you.  At least show up and talk about G.I. Joe with the belt on your shoulder.  But it also makes sense because when Cena attacks him, that's part of the attack.  You know, he's a movie star.  He doesn't care.  It's like the I'm still Jenny from the block syndrome.  Like he's forgetting his roots.  Don't know what that means. 
[03:51:00]  Nope.  You don't know?  She's still Jenny from the block?  Is she?  But she's not Jenny from the block.  She has mink eyelashes.  Right, right, right.  No, people don't have that.  So now he's a big movie star.  He's forgetting that he used to like body slam guys.  So he's not still The Rock from Stanford.  No.  No, he's not.  He's Hollywood.  He's Hollywood now.  And that's part of why people, well, I don't know anyone that hates The Rock.  But if you were against The Rock, that's part of your claim.  So what drew you back into wrestling?  The storylines.  What specifically?  What are you sitting there being like, first of all, why did you leave?  I think I just. 
[03:51:30]  Because I don't understand that at all.  I really got away from it.  I think it was because it was in that period of life where I was going from not having  any idea what I was going to do to, okay, I have to actually focus and try to figure  out a career here.  And so I guess I just disappeared from it for a while.  And when I came back, I was like, holy crap.  I really don't know what I was thinking.  And Punk was like a heel when I came back originally.  And now here we are, a heel again.  You like it better.  He belongs in that position.  I don't like him as a good guy.  You don't.  It doesn't feel right.  It doesn't.  And it wasn't really working, was it? 
[03:52:00]  He's better at being a jerk.  He is.  That's his natural instinct.  He is.  He is a jerk.  And I like that.  And he's great because if you, in real life, if you know him and he likes you, he's a great  guy.  Phil.  But I've watched him because I've interviewed him a bunch of times.  And I'm not going to go out on a limb and say he likes me because that is a kiss  of death.  But he at least is aware of me.  That's good.  Because, like, I'll go and...  He knows your name.  Yeah, yeah.  He knows me well.  Oh, wow.  I'll go...  They had sex.  We haven't.  It was hot.  Which was super hot.  It was second base. 
[03:52:30]  And it was good.  But it was good.  What is second base?  Is that boobies?  Boobies.  That's boobies.  Okay.  Yeah, we touch each other's boobs under the shirt.  Yeah.  Under the shirt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was great.  But I've seen him.  And, like, I remember, it was at a signing.  And I was trying to get an interview with him.  Yeah.  And WWE.com, his own website, was just going to get some quotes.  And they go back to his little dressing area.  And they go, hey, do you have anything to say for the website?  And he looks at him and he goes, no.  He showed me that.  He's scary, that one. 
[03:53:00]  They go, like, a quote or anything for the...  And he goes, no.  And I was like, okay, I hope he's not having, like, a difficult day or something.  Oh, my God.  And, literally, I walk by his room when he's coming out.  And he goes, what's up, dude?  How's it going?  And I interview everything.  And I'm like, okay.  He's anti-establishment.  Yeah.  You know, if he thinks you're different in any way,  I think he likes you.  I think I know any woman who likes wrestling.  You don't know a lot of people, Nicole.  You live in this really closed-up, gossip-girl, Manhattan world.  I like Gossip Girl, too.  Thank you.  Hello.  Yeah, but you are an open person. 
[03:53:30]  Except for refried beans.  I don't like those.  Yeah, I don't like those either.  What do sports people think when you're like,  I'm going to infuse pop culture and sports reporting?  Well, I mean, there's always the old school, you know,  just they don't understand why you'd want to do both.  I mean, I still get a lot of that.  Like, why would you leave one thing for another?  Yeah.  Which I never really understood why that makes sense.  I mean, I don't know anyone in my personal life  who just talks about one thing and one thing only.  So, and that's not the kind of person.  Except Mike Francesa.  Exactly.  And we're not hanging out anytime soon.  No.  So it's like, you know, I just don't get it. 
[03:54:00]  But I think the two go hand in hand.  We're all well-rounded people now.  I think so.  You know, when you go out and have drinks with your buddies,  you talk about everything.  Right.  And so that's, to me, it just seems natural.  It's a risky move because you left ESPN.  Right, which to many is considered, holy crap.  Right, to go to NBC.  I know, I know.  Because you wanted to do the sports and entertainment.  I wanted to do a little bit of everything.  Now you do a show on NBC Sports.  Yeah.  Crossover.  Yeah.  And Access Hollywood.  Yeah.  But you've got to be looking at Billy Bush.  Like, I've interacted with real men before. 
[03:54:30]  You've got to be kidding me.  Who are you?  I think he's in Nepal right now,  so I think we can say whatever we want.  Go, go, go.  That's my opinion.  I look at him like.  But I look at a lot of Hollywood that way.  I mean, it's an interesting view from this side  because I'll sit there and, you know, these people,  and it's the people that aren't actually talented  that bring the most amount of drama,  like whether it be reality stars, what have you,  but they're the ones with the posses and the times  and the publicists,  and I'm just sitting there like,  you know, I don't even want to talk to you.  Like, I'm being made to do this interview. 
[03:55:00]  Right.  I have no interest in anything you're going to say  or what you're trying to sell,  but it's just funny.  I mean, I think there are people like that on both sides.  I just find it on the entertainment side to be more.  There's more Hollywood types.  More douchiness, I think.  Than there are with the douchey athletes.  Yeah.  Because there are douchey athletes.  A hundred percent.  Yeah.  But they're, and they're, you know,  they're just hard to do interviews with sometimes too  because they're not always really great talkers,  and so you're kind of like,  okay, well that was like interviewing a child.  And they always say interviewing a child  is the toughest thing to do in this business,  and I think athletes are up there with that sometimes. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah, I mean, a lot of them,  there are a lot of smart athletes,  but there are a lot that aren't.  A lot that aren't.  Some of them have just been hit in the head too many times,  and it's just like,  oh, they're too cool.  Too cool is the problem.  And I've seen athletes go through school.  Like, I went to Syracuse freshman year  with Carmelo Anthony.  Oh.  So we share, I mean,  and he left after freshman year,  but I've told the,  yeah, I don't know why.  That education was so important.  I don't understand.  But I've told this story before  that, like, I had a friend  who was in history class with him,  and Melo, he'd never go to class. 
[03:56:00]  Why would he?  He's on the basketball team.  Yeah.  But he showed up,  I mean, I don't know,  but Melo was like a star.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was,  yeah, he was a big deal.  Yeah, because everybody knew he was,  he could go to the NBA,  and then he did.  I mean, the gym's named after him now,  for God's sake.  Yes.  Because it's like,  it's kind of a big deal.  Yeah.  But he shows up to class,  and he's wearing like a hoodie,  and he just,  for whatever reason,  he decided to show up one day,  but he put his head down on the desk.  Nope.  The whole class, right?  And then,  and the teacher just ignores it,  because the teacher's probably just like,  holy shit,  Carmelo Anthony's in my class right now. 
[03:56:30]  Don't do anything stupid.  Those are his braids.  This is amazing.  Oh, I forgot about that period of life.  Right.  That was cornrows.  Before Lala.  Obviously.  And yeah,  and you have to be avert,  not only to what he's doing on the court,  but what's going on with Lala and everything.  You're all over the place.  Oh, I mean,  I wake up thinking about it.  So, Carmelo.  First thing.  First thing every morning.  How's Lala doing?  How's Lala today?  Carmelo's got his head down on the desk,  and the teacher's ignoring it,  and then he,  randomly,  in the middle of this lesson,  probably about the War of 1812 or something, 
[03:57:00]  Carmelo Anthony just puts his hand up.  Randomly.  Oh, no.  And then the teacher goes,  and he's like flabbergasted.  He's like,  this is fantastic.  Mr. Anthony.  Yeah, he goes,  Carmelo,  and Carmelo Anthony,  I'll never forget this quote,  said,  War is bad.  It makes me sad.  No.  And then he put his head back down on the desk.  No, he did not.  Yes, he did.  Is he stoned?  I hope so.  I don't know,  but that was his contribution.  I mean, it's beautifully simple in its meaning. 
[03:57:30]  It may be haiku if we break down the syllables.  I'm not sure.  War is bad.  That actually makes me like Carmelo for a minute.  That story did.  Well, if you get to,  next time you interview him,  I'm assuming you'll get to talk to him at some point.  You gotta.  Do you think he remembers that,  or do you think he's so full of these wonderful little nuggets of beauty?  That's just a day.  Yeah, I mean,  that's one day in your life.  That was just class.  Like, yeah,  I went to class today.  War is bad.  I'd like to quote someone.  Let me know if this rings a bell.  Yeah.  Makes me sad. 
[03:58:00]  That's an amazing story.  You've never told me that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is so good.  Yeah, it's really funny.  Well, he's a whimsical guy that Carmelo Anthony.  He really is, truly.  I did not know.  Are you tough to be in a relationship with guys because I would assume it's very intimidating?  No, I don't think it's that.  To have somebody who knows about sports like you do.  Yeah, but, well,  I don't know if that's...  No matter what we may or may not know,  you guys always think you're smarter.  So that's...  I don't ever think that's a problem.  I think I'm just tough to be in a relationship with, period,  because I'm just very set in my ways and, you know, selfish with my time. 
[03:58:30]  You are.  I have...  As I get older,  and you guys will know this as you get older,  your patience level,  it just...  It almost becomes non-existent.  So what might have been in your 20s something cute that you're willing to overlook  in your late 30s is like,  nope,  and I'm done.  And it's sad.  And you're one of those, what they call, career women.  Yes.  One of those career chicks that wears tennis shoes to walk to the office  and it's shade in my heels.  I hate those women!  I hate them! 
[03:59:00]  Wearing Reeboks on the train.  You know what?  That's what they made flats for.  God, the 80s are over.  Oh, the 80s.  God damn it.  Such a bad look.  But, yeah,  so you don't think it's the sport...  Like, I enjoy...  I don't watch a lot of sports.  Yeah.  Wrestling takes up a huge amount of my time.  Well, it's kind of...  Yeah.  It's three hours every Monday, for God's sake.  Right.  Plus, you gotta at least keep up with what's going on on SmackDown and everywhere else  and read the dirt sheets and everything.  So, I mean...  Plus, you know, you gotta take your time to go to Toys R Us and buy the action figures.  Am I right, Beatle?  No, you don't.  Do you have the action...  Do you have, like, a whole collection of everything? 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  I have the chairs from Survivor Series and I'll have one from Mania.  Where are you sitting?  I don't know yet.  WWE is, like, being awesome to me right now.  Are they gonna put you on TV?  Um, I hope not.  I would like to have many beers, but we'll see.  No, no, no.  I don't mean, like, any.  I mean, in general.  Like, are they gonna let you start, like...  Oh, I don't know.  I've heard...  They haven't gotten back to me with what exactly we're gonna be doing, but I'm gonna, like,  really love this week.  I'm gonna go to the thing on Thursday night and Hall of Fame on...  Are you doing all of it?  Yeah.  Hall of Fame on Saturday?  Friday mornings, Radio Row.  Oh, my God. 
[04:00:00]  Punk and Paul Heyman are gonna be there.  Paul Heyman's also brilliant.  You know he's from Westchester?  I know.  Same place Sam Roberts is from.  That's me.  That's weird.  That's me.  Hey, guys, let's hit me.  Sam Roberts.  Who the hell is Sam Roberts?  The audience will think I was just doing it, but in actuality, it was in case you forgot  what my name was while we were sitting there, and you're like, oh, yeah, Sam Roberts.  I've heard of him.  I've done that, like, on a date.  You're like, oh, my God, I don't think he has any idea what my last name is.  That's why you just have to go, hey, you know what Michelle Beatle says.  Why do they call you that?  That's my last name.  Don't worry.  It's my last name.  Michelle's my first name. 
[04:00:30]  Now you know.  This is a big week.  What's going on Thursday night, then?  I don't know.  It's a fundraiser or something or other, but I just, I rarely go to stuff like that.  I'm very antisocial when it comes to, like, hanging out.  Like, I just want to go to a bar and be with friends, but I don't want to do red carpet-y  type things.  Right.  But, yeah, this week is the exception to every rule I've ever had.  Because wrestlers will be there.  Well, it's just, and I'm dragging her.  Jenna's never done this stuff.  You've never done any of it?  She's going to be transformed.  I went to WrestleMania when I was little. 
[04:01:00]  What year?  God, I was like, I went when I was, like, seven, maybe.  How old are you now?  Do you mind me asking?  Oh, 35.  No, you're not.  I was going to say, you look damn good.  No, but I used to be really into, like, Shawn Michaels and Bernie Hart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm hoping they'll be there.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, they're in town.  See?  Literally everybody's in town.  This is the party.  Like, I know.  I'm excited.  All the people that aren't actually doing anything at WrestleMania are all doing, like, the, you know,  second-rate podunk shows and conventions and stuff like that. 
[04:01:30]  Well, there's a roast for Iron Sheik on Thursday.  Right.  That is happening.  That's kind of awesome, too.  I mean, everybody.  Yeah.  Shawn Michaels and Bernie Hart are going to be in New York.  This is like the Comic-Con for WrestleNerds.  Right.  Right.  Which I imagine.  Because I'm going to go to the FanFest.  Is that Saturday, right?  It's all, it's, I think it's starting on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  You might have to go at least for a day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is going to be nuts.  But you're going to get bombarded, though, because you know what happens?  Not even a little bit.  Wrestling, no, yes, you will.  Because wrestling fans.  Not when you see me in costume. 
[04:02:00]  Just kidding.  You'll have your CM Punk beard painted on.  That would be really cool, I think.  I'm all oiled up.  Yeah.  Disgusting.  Wrestling fans love people in mainstream media that talk about wrestling at all.  Why?  Is it just because they feel, like, put upon and the angst?  Because wrestling is so polarizing.  Yeah.  Like, and you'll hear about it.  This is why I'm going back and forth with you.  Because otherwise, these people will eat me alive.  Why?  Like, if we just sat here and talked about wrestling for 30 minutes, I may lose my job.  Yeah, you would.  But they know that you're a super wrestling guy, right? 
[04:02:30]  Everybody knows that.  Well, then, what do they want you to talk about?  Pottery?  Because for wrestling, yeah, it's like, well, at least it's not wrestling.  But for wrestling fans, all they want to hear about is wrestling.  Yeah.  For non-wrestling fans, they would never want to hear about one sentence and they wish for your death.  It's like you're talking about NAMBLA in here.  Like, you're just like, I love that.  NAMBLA gets a better reaction most of the time.  That's actually, um...  Which is a shame.  Except through Law & Order, though.  Yeah, which is a shame. 
[04:03:00]  People got accustomed to that kind of stuff.  But so what was the wrestler or the storyline that brought you back in?  Ten years later, you'd fallen off.  It's a different era right now.  It really is.  I mean, you're sitting there used to Stone Cold flipping people off and The Rock raising his eyebrow and whatnot.  But, I mean, is it really that different?  No.  Because we still have people filling those different needs that, you know, you got the punk that just hates everyone.  Rock's still around.  I just, you know, Undertaker's still around.  It's been interesting that people have come back.  Yeah.  That I was like, you know, I'm waiting for Stone Cold. 
[04:03:30]  I'm just not giving up on the idea that we're going to hear the breaking of the glass and he's going to walk out.  You know what I think Stone Cold's been doing?  He's just been sitting back and going, as long as The Rock is getting a headlining bill, fuck you guys.  Stone Cold's not coming back.  There's no way Stone Cold is second bill.  But if he came back, oh, can you imagine if we're, like, on Sunday night, we hear that sound?  Oh, my, that would be it.  I will have a heart attack.  I hope not.  I think I will.  I think I will.  I will go nuts.  It'll be the stupidest thing I've ever done.  My God.  But you don't remember what specifically?  No, I remember it was just, it was everything. 
[04:04:00]  It was just people that were still wrestling that I had not realized were still around.  And I got just swept right back up into the whole idea of good versus evil, you know, dorks versus,  I obviously, this time, you know, with this anti-immigrant thing that Jack Swagger's doing.  I don't know.  Brilliant.  It's brilliant.  It's, it, I thought at first, I was like, wow, they've really pushed the envelope, but  it's, it is brilliant.  It's brilliant because, I mean, and then people are like, but that's terrible.  It is terrible.  Yeah.  He's the bad guy.  Right.  You're supposed to not like what he's doing. 
[04:04:30]  There are tons of people that are like, yeah.  That's why it works.  There are a few people I think, well, it's about time to make some sense on this goddamn show.  You have a great Southern accent, Sam.  Do you think so?  Have you ever spent time down there?  Yeah.  My family's from Kentucky.  Isn't that great?  Oh, that's super, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Super sexy.  No, I was going to say the super South.  I was going to say that's super sexy.  You like that?  Yeah, I can't dig back.  Just sort of the dirty redneck.  Yeah.  Can you do the little dip thing?  No.  Okay.  You should work on that if you're going to do it.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  I try to stay coastal. 
[04:05:00]  What's the big storyline at WrestleMania?  Because I'm going.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  What's the big storyline?  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  Somebody was like, do you want to go to WrestleMania?  And I was like, fuck yeah.  Do you know how hard a ticket that is right now?  I bought it.  It was like $450 months ago.  I was just like, yeah, I'm going to do it.  Yeah.  I came just like some money.  It's totally going to be worth it.  It was like they have.  He's rolling in the dough.  Okay, you're going to love it.  He's got it.  So I'm like, you know what?  WrestleMania sounds like it'd be really fun.  You tell me.  I used to like WrestleMania in like 95 with like Razor Ramon and all that shit.  Well, Undertaker's still undefeated at WrestleMania.  I know that.  He's taking on Punk.  You tell me, Michelle Beatle. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  What's the match you're looking forward to the most?  That one, actually.  Punk Undertaker.  Because on the one hand, I feel like Taker has to win.  But on the other hand, wouldn't it just be catastrophic if he didn't?  CM Punk won.  Right.  And that was the end of the streak.  Right.  What do you think of them taking the real life death of Paul Bearer?  Love it so much.  It hurts me inside.  It's great, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's what's supposed to be done.  We all die.  Relax.  Yeah.  And his family apparently gave him their blessing.  Plus, you look at a guy who's been in wrestling all his life and then he dies, he's probably  going to be like, you know what?  Let's keep it going.  It's beautiful that it went that way.  The show must go on. 
[04:06:00]  The show must go on.  The fact that the urn is being dropped every Monday is hilarious.  You like it.  It's just cool and awesome.  You love CM Punk.  Well, I also love, I think the shock value is good.  Didn't you guys have an interaction a while back?  He threw a shirt at you or something?  Yes.  He rubbed my head, which is a code for a lot of things, I think.  And you've never, you've never gotten together since, like you've never done an interview  or anything since then?  No.  We had a dinner once where he sat, because you know, he doesn't drink.  Yes, Zito.  It's industry stuff.  Yeah, I don't, what is that?  The fingers locking means interview. 
[04:06:30]  It looks like an orgy when you do that.  I don't know what you guys do.  So you and five people have never, uh.  Oh, no, hey, oh.  No, we had a dinner once and because he's straight edge, he doesn't drink.  Right.  So I drank a bottle of wine while he sat there and watched me.  So now it's like a joke.  Like even when he's like grumpy or whatever, I'm like, would you like to come watch me drink  a bottle of wine?  Yeah.  Will that cheer you up?  No, thanks.  One time he was, uh, he was very offended at me once because I went and told everybody  that I was, I was on the aisle there at one of the shows and I told everybody that CM  Punk winked at me.  Oh, well, that's good. 
[04:07:00]  And he goes, he's, the next time he saw me, he goes, don't tell people I fucking winked  at you.  I nodded at you to say what's up.  I did not wink.  And I go, one of your eyes was shut.  Yeah.  Thank you.  So what kind of nod was that?  If not that.  You could do a friendly wink.  You don't have to be all machismo about it.  Yeah, relax, dude.  No one's saying anything more than you winked at him.  Yeah, really.  He wants it to be that way though, right?  Who?  Whoever you're talking about.  CM Punk.  What do you mean whoever?  Jesus.  We've been in here for four hours talking about this.  You're losing me.  This is why you weren't invited.  I know.  I just wanted to say hi to you.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm losing the guest that was not invited. 
[04:07:30]  I'm sorry.  All right?  So why don't you watch your lip, Missy?  My bad.  You're going to love it.  You should watch.  I will not.  I will not do that.  Shoot, it's going to be so good.  I will not do that.  What else are you looking forward to?  I want to beat up Vicky Guerrero.  I would love to fight her.  That's the other thing.  My wife is sitting there watching the show and she's going, why did they let this?  She's so annoying.  Why did they let her on TV?  She's so annoying.  She's a bad guy.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to enjoy watching her.  You're not supposed to.  That's the beauty of it.  I'm interested.  Well, I will always love Triple H, so I'm kind of interested to see how that goes. 
[04:08:00]  I don't think he's going to beat Brock Lesnar.  I think this is going to be the end of his career.  Really?  I think so.  It's a career ending match, Zito.  He loses his job.  Holy Christ.  It doesn't matter if he's Vince McMahon's son-in-law.  He loses his job.  That's right.  That's exactly right.  There was a time when I wrote for ProWrestling.com.  I do no shit.  I just stopped watching a really long time ago.  This is no holds barred, Triple H, Lesnar.  Can I tell you what's going to happen?  Your life's going to change.  And Monday nights, you are going to be on Twitter with the rest of us, live tweeting  for three hours, and you won't even realize it, because Sunday's going to be that good. 
[04:08:30]  Hey, do your Twitter followers tell you to shut up when you're talking about-  A lot do.  Shut the fuck up.  A lot do.  Nobody cares about wrestling.  I know.  But I always laugh, because I'm like, hey, ass, I've been doing this for so many months  now.  You don't have to follow.  Yeah.  And the majority of people are like, all right, let's do this, Monday night.  You know why, like-  $149,999.  Yeah.  You know why, like, Michelle Beadle?  She's marketing herself as a complete human being.  None of this sort of like, hey, I'm your go-to for this or that.  She's like, you know what?  My go-to.  I am everything that is Michelle Beadle. 
[04:09:00]  Yeah.  That's true.  I am.  And you can watch her.  That was very deep.  That was mellow-esque.  That's me wrapping this thing up.  I like that.  That's professional.  Yeah.  He's got the arms open.  That's this.  Interlocking.  Interlocking.  The orgy interview.  We're all going to have an orgy now.  Okay.  Which is great.  I shaved this morning.  Fantastic.  The crossover's on the NBC Sports Network.  Yes.  What time is it on?  You know, 6-ish, sometimes 10.30.  Okay.  We re-air a bunch.  6-ish or 10.30?  Well, we're definitely on at 6 every day, but then they re-air the heck out of it.  I feel bad for your co-host, by the way. 
[04:09:30]  Why?  Because it's your show.  Well, yeah.  I mean, when you look at the description, it's like, Michelle Beadle, one of the most beloved sports  and also her co-host.  That's the word.  You know what?  That's what I came here for.  It's like, it's like, it's like Nicole.  You're like Beyonce in there, like Destiny's Child.  It's like Nicole on the morning mashup.  That's exactly how he sees it.  They're like, it's the great Nicole Biggins, and she has three guys with her.  That's, but see?  That's awesome, right?  It should be.  It's not like that.  You're also on Access Hollywood.  Yes.  So tune in for that, and make sure you follow her, Michelle D. Beadle.  Nice.  It's past tense with Michelle. 
[04:10:00]  I had to put it in there.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's a D.  I had to change it, so that was all I had.  Show in the middle names and love.  Michelle D. Beadle on Twitter.  She'll be talking about WrestleMania all week, and so will I.  It's going to be horrible for a lot of people.  Thank you for making a lot of people's including my dream come true.  This is awesome.  Anytime, guys.  We're right across the street.  Love it.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Rod and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye.  The Kobe and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time, over.  For real this time, over.  For real this time, over. 
[04:10:30]  For real this time, over.  For real this time, over. </pre>
