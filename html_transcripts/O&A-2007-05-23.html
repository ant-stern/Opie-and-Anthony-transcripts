<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a significant portion of Opie's birthday, interspersed with their typical crude humor and tangents. The show began with self-deprecating jokes about their personalities, Opie's massive digital photo collection, his aversion to gift exchanges with Anthony, and reminiscing about their past escapades.  Anthony discussed his poker games, and a listener named Hope called in, expressing potential interest in visiting Opie's house. Opie recounted spending nearly $1000 on drinks for listeners at a bar.  A substantial segment focused on their fascination with news reporter Jill Nicolini, featuring extensive, sexually charged commentary about her appearance.

The conversation then shifted to movies, including *Natural Born Killers*, *Grindhouse*, and the evolving landscape of media consumption, debating the future of movie theaters versus the convenience of home viewing. This led to a memory of their youth, when they created a makeshift drive-in movie theater in their backyard.  The discussion expanded to online shopping and home delivery services.  Opie then shared graphic details about his awkward experience with a school sex education film and his family's reactions, including his father's colorful language.  This was followed by a humorous story about a childhood puppet and the resulting family argument. The broadcast briefly touched on Fleet Week in New York City.

Another segment opened with Opie discussing spicy food-induced discomfort and his barbecue plans. Anthony described his sparsely furnished home and impending move. Opie mentioned showing his girlfriend the JFK assassination footage on YouTube. A significant portion detailed a past radio stunt: a sperm count competition between Opie and Anthony, which included embarrassing details about the process and Anthony's victory. They discussed the challenges of performing the act on air, the station staff's reactions, and the shift in workplace culture since then.

Opie's birthday continued to be a focus, beginning with a fruit platter from the executive producers and complaints about a failed birthday breakfast.  Opie’s frequent bowel movements led to more crude humor.  A substantial segment featured "Rock Scream Tuesday," where staff, particularly Roland, unsuccessfully attempted rock screams, prompting comedic commentary.  This transitioned into movie discussions, featuring Roland’s unenthusiastic reviews, especially his struggles with pronouncing "Shrek."

A humorous, fictional phone interview with the deceased Ronald Reagan followed, covering his afterlife, interactions with JFK and Marilyn Monroe, his diaries, and Nancy Reagan's comments on those diaries. The show also included a promotional segment for Bud Light, discussions of slow news (including the American Idol finale and a story about a 60-year-old woman having twins), derisive comments on Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco, and coverage of a murderer’s "Go Raiders!" final words, leading to a discussion of lethal injection and other execution methods.  A news segment about "helmet boxing" was played and discussed.

Opie's birthday celebrations continued with an intern presentation, scripted by Pat Duffy, involving a cake and a human pyramid of three shirtless interns resembling Matt Damon, Clay Aiken, and Biff Tannen.  The hosts and audience reacted negatively.  The segment concluded with discussion of the presentation, a humorous radio skit by the interns, and a "line of the day" featuring jokes about JFK and Ronald Reagan. The show ended with a curt dismissal from producer Tom.  Aside from Hope, no other guests were explicitly mentioned as being in studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything. 
[00:03:30]  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police.  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder.  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school. 
[00:04:00]  You probably have three or four kids and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  Go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in.  I just think Nazi and I can't get it out of my head.  I love Jim Norton.  Hilarious.  Hilarious people.  You guys ready to laugh? 
[00:04:30]  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's all about me.  What's wrong with you today?  It's someone's special day. 
[00:05:00]  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, times ten.  That's it?  I can't hear you.  You've got to speak up.  What did you get up here for his birthday?  Yeah, what did you get me for my birthday? 
[00:05:30]  Nothing.  That crap ended years ago.  We don't get each other anything anymore.  I think for a while we would give each other like a CD or a DVD.  Hey, I know you like this movie, so happy birthday.  That ended like, God, probably Boston days.  That ended when we got into happy relationships.  Yeah, exactly.  There you go.  You're happy, I'm happy.  We get whatever we want for ourselves.  We didn't need to lean on each other anymore, so go after yourself.  Happy birthday. 
[00:06:00]  That's it.  I've got to go home to my girl.  I was going through some of the pictures on my computer last night.  Yeah.  Like millions of them.  I have a folder that just says pictures, and then I open it up,  and there's 10,000 folders in there, each with like 10,000 pictures in it.  It's ridiculous how many pictures I've taken over the years.  And I found one that said old radio.  So I click on it, and it's all the old Boston stuff with us and Turks and Caicos and stuff. 
[00:06:30]  And I've got to send you one.  I was going to send one last night and just put, who are these guys?  Oh, really?  Because we're just on the beach, like drinking and all sunburned and all younger.  It was hysterical.  Just hammered all the time.  Yeah.  Laying back by the pool, smoking Cuban cigars.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Sure.  Like, God damn, look at all these.  And now I don't even know what your new house looks like.  Yep.  I haven't even been there. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, well.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  But Anthony has games.  He has poker games.  I have poker games.  Are you invited?  Anyone's invited.  Were you invited?  I don't want to be anyone is invited.  I want you are personally invited for a tour of my castle.  You're absolutely invited any time you want.  I don't want to be in the anyone's invited category.  No offense to the anybody's out there.  I understand.  But Jimmy, I have gotten this call.  I am.  Hope, what's up? 
[00:07:30]  I'm on a Long Island.  I'm thinking on my way into the city, I can drop by the house.  Hope, any time.  Please, stop by.  Stop by.  All right.  Maybe I'll do that.  Next day I see Opie here.  Well, because I'm hinting there.  I still need the, oh, that would be awesome.  We'll throw a few on the Barbie queue for you.  Greg Hughes, you are cordially invited to the Kumia estate.  Look, a lot of people think I'm a dick.  And that's fine if you want to think that.  I don't agree with that.  But I want to thank everybody from the message boards wishing me a very happy birthday today. 
[00:08:00]  Actually, that made me very happy.  Saw that.  I'm trying to show you a different side of me.  Just a different side of me from time to time.  For example, like throwing a credit card down on a bar and having you freaks drink me out of house and home.  Yeah, that'll put a damper on that.  Oh, my God.  They ruined it.  Oh, my God.  I paid for drinks at FH Riley's.  And I'm going to have to tell everyone about 100 times yes. 
[00:08:30]  One hour open bar on me, close to $1,000.  And it's like kind of a regular bar.  The drinks aren't that expensive there.  Yeah.  Oh, I should have brought the freaking bill in.  It was hilarious.  20 Coronas, 25 Guinnesses, all sorts of stuff.  And then one coffee.  So, I'm like, oh, that had to be Stalker Patty's drink.  A cup of coffee. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  Anyway, our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  We can't get enough of Jill Nicolini.  It's all about Jill Nicolini.  Well, they seem to be, if I didn't know any better.  And this makes sense for the rest of the country.  So, relax, radio executive.  Here they go again.  They're talking local.  Just picture, insert your hot local news chick here.  Right.  Our station in Baton Rouge isn't going to understand what's going on today. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Just think really hot chick that has no business being on the news.  Yeah.  But they're trying to figure out what to do with her because she's a really hot chick.  Well, there's a picture of her up on the other.  Thank you, E-Rock.  He's popped a picture of her up there.  Well, she was a traffic girl in the helicopter.  They took her out of the helicopter and put her in the studio to do traffic.  Where?  So, she stands in front of a stupid little traffic map.  Well.  Where little moving cars are chugging along. 
[00:10:00]  And bouncing off her body now.  Yeah.  But they took her advice.  We're like, look, you got this girl.  She's hot.  You don't really know what to do with her yet.  So, now you got her doing traffic in a studio, which is ridiculous.  No one watches TV for traffic reports because you're in your car when you really need the traffic reports.  Yeah.  That's why I never understood the traffic reports on TV.  And so, they would show her for two seconds.  Then they would show like this weird old school map of square little cars just riding around the New York area. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And then they'd finally go back to her for another quick two seconds and she's really hot and she looks good on TV.  So, they finally took her advice and now she's on the screen almost the whole time with all these cars kind of bouncing into her body.  Mm-hmm.  Trying to, you know.  Yeah.  Do what nature says we should be doing.  It looks very suggestive where the cars are driving sometimes.  So suggestive that we're taking the video and we're, I don't know, we might enhance it a little bit.  Alter what the cars are. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  So, now.  So, we're watching her career very closely and now today they got her doing an entertainment piece.  She was doing a little piece.  They sat her at the desk.  She introed the piece.  It was a little piece on Coney Island.  Historic New York's Coney Island.  I do believe this could be her first like piece that has nothing to do with traffic.  And they went for a very easy thing.  Yeah.  Go down to Coney Island and interview the people on the boardwalk.  Talk about the history a little bit.  See what's going on. 
[00:11:30]  So, the first shot, the first shot is her walking down the boardwalk and her cans are  just bouncing up and down as she's holding the mic and interviewing somebody and walking  down the boardwalk.  And it's working as Dan pointed out because we were all watching as he said this stupid  piece.  It was the dumbest who cares story ever.  But Jill, Nicolini was doing it so we had to watch.  All of our necks were cranking around backwards trying to look at the TV screen because there 
[00:12:00]  she was walking on Coney Island.  She's talking to Sideshow Guy.  She's talking to some, I don't know, restaurant that's been open since 1924.  Talking to the...  About the Wonder Wheel, the big Ferris wheel there.  Yeah, the guy that operates that.  It's nonsense that if it was any other news person doing it, you wouldn't even hear it  in the background.  It's called a fluff piece.  And we were just fixated on that stupid fluff piece because of her. 
[00:12:30]  And one guy, they're interviewing one guy about, I guess, the Wonder Wheel.  And his partner was there and then some lady.  And the one dude that had no speaking role in this fluff piece was just staring at her  chest.  This is terrible.  She's interviewing somebody.  They're talking.  And the guy is just standing there looking at her chest.  But who wouldn't?  Channel 11 locally here in New York has gold and they know it.  And they're just like, they're working her up to be an anchor woman.  You watch.  You watch. 
[00:13:00]  They're making sure she doesn't show too much cleavage in the studio now and all that.  Yeah.  Pushing those babies down.  Those babies.  They are babies.  Anyway, so.  Do you remember Natural Born Killers with Oliver Stone?  He's so brilliant.  When he showed the news woman reading the news, she was like braless in a white t-shirt and  you could see through it.  And she was just reading the news.  It was such a great statement about what the news was.  It was really a great moment.  I love Natural Born Killers.  You know what? 
[00:13:30]  I might buy that for my birthday today.  Why don't you let one of us get it for you?  We're a little present.  I haven't watched that movie in a while, but it says a lot, that film, certainly.  And what's his name?  He said he didn't like it.  Well, it's what I remember when Tarantino wrote the screenplay.  He said he especially hated the Rodney Dangerfield section.  I love the Rodney Dangerfield stuff.  And I said to Q, I said that I kind of, I said I kind of like that.  And QT.  Yeah, QT.  Now I understand why he came in and did our show.  The movie didn't do too well. 
[00:14:00]  And I still say that I loved Grindhouse.  Yeah, what happened?  Because then a lot of people are like, oh man, you guys were just kissing their ass because,  you know, you were getting all those people on your show.  Look, they're not here.  They're not coming on anytime soon.  I loved Grindhouse.  I really did.  And it was really cool talking to Q.  I enjoyed it, too.  QT.  Yeah, and when Quentin was saying that kind of stuff, I mean, I couldn't disagree with him  outright, but I didn't agree with his National Born Killers assessment.  But yeah, I like Grindhouse, too.  And they're smart.  They're going to release it in two different movies.  They'll make money back.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, put some extras in there.  Cut out stuff.  Well, it was so non-traditional that it just didn't do well in the movie theaters.  And you know what?  It got good reviews, but people just didn't buy into it.  They didn't go to the theater to watch the damn thing, unfortunately.  Yeah, a little too different for people.  People like just, you know, oh, here comes the third Shrek.  And I believe, I like the Shrek movies.  I think they're fun.  I like some of those animated little features.  But it's like, those are the things that break records. 
[00:15:00]  You know, the third Spider-Man breaking records.  I like the Spider-Man franchise, too.  But, you know, basically, this country really isn't into new things, different things.  Things are a little, things that are like on the periphery of what everybody's used to.  Well, what sucks is the people that want something a little different, we're the ones that suffer.  You know, I like, I'll go see Spider-Man 3.  I'll go see Shrek 3.  But that's not my type of movie.  I like going more to the artsy theaters and seeing something that's a little deeper, you know. 
[00:15:30]  Artsy fartsy?  Are you artsy fartsy?  Did you go to that Huntington movie theater?  The New Community Cinema or whatever?  Yes.  I used to go to the New Community Cinema just because it was one of the few places that this girl's mother used to let her go.  Because it was like art movies.  Oh, really?  And we would go to these stupid movies with, like, subtitles, and believe me, when you're 17 or something like that, you don't want to sit through some subtitled French art movie.  When you're 17, you don't want to read. 
[00:16:00]  But believe me, French wasn't only going on on the screen, let me tell you, if you know what I mean.  You're going to go out and see the movie about Grease.  You know what, though?  As far as the artsy movies go, though, most of them are crap.  But if you do a little research, you get to see a good one every once in a while, you know.  Speaking of movies, I was reading an article yesterday.  They're trying to get the new releases in your house.  Really?  And a lot of movie companies or whatever are signing on to it. 
[00:16:30]  Comcast wants to do it.  See, that's the way to go.  No more theaters, you mean, for certain films?  Well, the other side's like, this is going to kill movie theaters.  It's going to kill them because, you know, they're not going to be able to survive.  Some purists.  I mean, still, yeah, people still go to the movie theaters, but not enough to keep those places, you know, rocking.  Hey, look at drive-in movie theaters.  They were all the rage for years, and then now you can't find one in the country.  It just happens. 
[00:17:00]  Things evolve.  Well, Comcast is trying to...  People wanted better sound and better picture quality, so you wouldn't go to the drive-in anymore to just, like, see a crappy...  Because it was always that stupid speaker on your window or something, and then they figured out how you could tune in your AM radio to pick it up on your...  But no one had a good sound system in their car, so still, you're not getting good sound.  The picture sucked, and if it rained, you were really screwed.  So it was like one of those things where people weren't going to drive-ins anymore.  I think it's going to be the same thing with movie theaters.  I'm annoyed at movie theaters. 
[00:17:30]  I can't sit there with a group of people I don't know.  Imagine inviting a bunch of strangers into your living room to watch a movie and making noise and talking.  You'd lose your mind.  How come in a movie theater it's different and you've got to, like, kind of be nice and cordial?  Well, just, yeah, I want to sit there and scratch when I want to scratch, pause, get up, take a leak, whatever I've got to do.  You've got to squeeze into a seat and share an armrest with some complete stranger.  Yeah.  It is time to update the whole thing.  So Comcast is trying to get it done. 
[00:18:00]  Somebody's holding out.  Basically, it would be $40 or $50.  And so, like, Shrek 3 came out last weekend.  You could pay for it right on your TV, $40 or $50, because they know...  It's like a pay-per-view.  Yeah, they know you're going to probably get a few people watching, not just you and your lady.  Maybe...  Maybe it is just the two of you.  It's $25 a clip.  And that's so worth it, right?  Convenience of hanging out in your house?  Eh, I'll just keep doing what I do.  No, I understand.  What do you do?  I go to the movie theater.  Yeah, right. 
[00:18:30]  But wait, no.  Maybe you just said you don't go, and yet you've seen a lot of new movies.  I get...  Actually, I get screener copies, because I'm a big celebrity that does movie reviews and stuff,  and I get the screener copies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I like movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, it would be $40 to $50, and you would get Shrek 3 in your house the same day it's released in movie theaters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But someone's holding out.  That's too, though, I think, right?  Well, absolutely.  They're saying it'll hurt the DVD business.  It'll hurt the theaters.  But I guess, oh, boy, I probably should have read it a little closer. 
[00:19:00]  But I guess they're starting to get, you know, they're trying to get...  Comcast is also trying to get, when the DVD comes out, to get it on the TV that day.  They're at least trying to get that done.  Wow.  Yeah, so...  That'll affect DVD sales.  Hey, you know, that's the...  But honestly, you know, they're fighting it.  One of the companies fighting it and stuff.  But this is the future.  It's obvious that eventually that's what is going to happen.  You want stuff delivered to your house immediately.  Like, there are movies that I wanted to see. 
[00:19:30]  And it was like, I could swear I saw this on, like, HBO On Demand.  So I'll go there, and it'll be gone.  It was there, like, the other day, and it's gone, and you're pissed.  Yeah.  I want...  I would love for every movie to be available.  Like, some giant library somewhere where you could just go on your cable system, punch  through in alphabetical order or enter the movie title, and there it is.  That's what I don't understand.  Because when we're looking for a movie on our cable system...  Yeah.  There's so many movies that you just can't get still. 
[00:20:00]  Why?  I don't know.  That's ridiculous.  I do not know.  But it's the future.  We've got to make it available.  The only older movies that are available are pretty much crappy ones.  Yeah.  For some reason.  So, all right.  If these other movies are that much more valuable because of DVDs or whatever, then up the price.  There's a market out there.  People will spend $20 or whatever on a classic old movie or something.  Right?  Yeah.  By the way, Al Dukes is saying Sony seems to be the only company that's holding out on  this right now. 
[00:20:30]  Every other company is ready to go where they'll deliver these movies to your house the same  day it goes into theaters.  And the reason that's happening is because our systems at home, for the most part, are  comparable, if not better, than the movie theater.  You know, I'm not an audiophile or whatever they're called.  But my system, even, is better than a movie theater.  Yeah.  You're getting great sound and picture now with widescreen, HD.  I don't go to the movies often.  But when I do, I'm just amazed how old it now looks. 
[00:21:00]  There's a place.  Some places do these things.  There's a place in, I think it was Florida or Nashville or wherever I was, Kansas City,  where they have the theaters where you can get service.  I'm sure they have them here, too.  Stadium seating.  Yeah.  Like a real giant lounge chair.  Yeah.  They can bring you beers and stuff like that.  That's where movie theaters will survive.  They're going to have to step it up and do things like that.  You know, everybody's got to either adapt or you go away.  Right.  That's in every business because there's going to be competition, new technology that comes  out.  And with the delivering movies to your home like that and the TV is getting better and 
[00:21:30]  cheaper, the sound systems are unbelievable for the home systems now, and they're a lot  cheaper.  The movie theaters are going to have to do something where they can't just usher you in  like cattle to sit there and be interrupted by crying babies and screaming people.  Cell phones.  Screaming diversity and cell phones and everything else that just wrecks the movie experience  for people.  Sitting in those little crappy chairs that, for the love of God, have not been upgraded  since I was a kid going to the goddamn movies. 
[00:22:00]  It's the same theater seat you're sitting in.  They've been getting away with murder, basically.  And they cram you in.  If you're sitting there in a nice, big, loungy chair, because I've been to some of those theaters  with the stadium seating where it's really staggered, where you don't have some big oafs head in  front of you.  That's another thing.  You go to a certain movie theater.  You don't know what you're getting.  You sit down.  It's a crapshoot.  That lurch isn't going to sit in front of you.  And now you've got this big square head that you're staring at.  Yeah.  So goddamn annoying.  Yeah.  And now they're going to have to do something. 
[00:22:30]  Step it up or, yeah, you go out of business.  Sorry.  Well, now they're going to have to work for us again.  Right.  They're going to have to make it worth our while to go to the theaters.  Now you do something.  They're going to have to do something that's going to make you go, yeah.  Prostitution.  How about that?  You can get little favors as you're watching a movie.  Hey, by the way, and really fast, too, the latest rage this summer is making your own  drive-in movies theater in the backyard.  Really?  Yeah.  People are getting systems for outside. 
[00:23:00]  And then inviting, like.  I did see that.  Like, if you have a kid, you know, around that perfect age, you know, she or he invites  all their friends over.  You have a little, almost like sleepover and watch a movie right in your backyard.  Giant screen, yeah.  They're saying, you know, that's selling like crazy.  People are getting their systems for outside now.  What a great idea, man.  Yeah.  We used to do that back in the day, me and Buzzy, back in Rochester.  What, roll the TV out?  That's what I'm saying.  We would, I think we invented this.  Hoo-hoo.  The old Zenith.  When the big fights were happening, like the Tyson fights and stuff, we were always trying 
[00:23:30]  to figure out how to make money because we just never had money.  And so we would set up our backyard.  You'd charge money.  Oh, yeah.  That's against the law.  Oh, yeah, we charged.  So, you know, he was the TV guy.  I was the radio guy.  So we would take our whole living room and then some and put it in the backyard.  Couches, coffee tables.  We'd set up the lamps.  And you didn't have the big screens back then.  Rich people did, I guess. 
[00:24:00]  But we would just, you know, haul the TV out there with long wires going out the window.  And then we'd have other TVs on the lawn.  So people would just pick their section to watch the fight.  And then we'd have TVs all over the house.  He literally would set up like 20 TVs for the fight.  And then we would charge a fee for the beer.  Nominal fee.  A fee for the keg.  Fair.  And, man, at the end of the night, we're like 100, 200, 300, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Paying our rent, baby.  Did you send your share to the cable company?  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  They could go screw.  Prove that we actually did it back in the day.  You know what else I'm liking is the fact that iTunes, and this thing is in its infancy, too,  is offering TV shows, box sets of TV series that are on, where you can then go download them to your computer.  You can't burn them to disc, which sucks.  But now new TVs, you can plug your computer right into the TV, and it will play on your television. 
[00:25:00]  And that's in its infancy.  Yeah.  That's in its infancy.  But to just sit there and go, oh, I want to watch that now.  And then, boom, you get it.  You're watching a marathon.  Yeah, absolutely.  That day.  We want instant gratification.  Yeah.  What's the holdup?  We're ready for this.  Rich in Queens, what's up?  Hey, dude, I disagree with you about the movie thing.  Yeah.  First of all, I think all the new movies stink.  I don't go anyway.  But eventually, we're just going to be a society of nobody on the streets just glued to your computers in your house. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, paradise.  I call that paradise.  And you know what?  Another thing is, I shop online now because I hate going to the stores.  Yeah.  But I've become my father in the 70s, peeping through the blinds with his yellowing boxer shorts on when the UPS comes to the door.  Don't you think the UPS truck is for you every time it drives by and you feel bad?  It's like when you were a kid and the ice cream truck went by.  You'd be like, hey, where's he going?  I had a package.  I thought it was for me.  I need a package.  Amazon's sending something.  If somebody knocks on my door, I almost had a heart attack. 
[00:26:00]  In the 70s, we showed a movie in my backyard, too.  I picture like you, but it was like the Greg Brady episode where he's got that UFO up and he's playing the flute from his window on a sheet in the backyard.  How ridiculous is that?  You know, dude, when you're saying that like the movie theaters, people like me and Keith Robinson are arguing about this one time because I'm saying that they will eventually go away.  Eventually.  And he's like, no, people always like that community experience.  And what's going to happen is this.  There's going to be some kind of a terrorist attack in movie theaters or they're going to do something and it's going to make people not want to go.  And that's going to be the next logical step. 
[00:26:30]  That'll be the end of that.  Yeah.  We're ready.  We want our stuff in our homes.  We want to watch it when we want to watch it.  We have all that technology.  So you just got to let it happen.  And then something else will develop as far as our society goes.  It's just going to go the way of everything else like, you know, dramas done on the radio was a huge thing until TV came out.  And then that went away.  There's a variety of reclusive weirdos watching these little tiny TVs walking down the block not being able to talk to anybody. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, we barely talk to each other anyway.  I go, I, believe me, I send out to, I go to drugstore.com.  We go to, like, Peapod and they deliver the food, the groceries.  There's no reason to go to a store anymore.  I swear to you, I do not go to stores.  See, that's where we're different.  I like being out and about doing my thing.  I like being out and about doing things I like doing.  I don't like being out and about doing things that annoy me. 
[00:27:30]  You know what annoys me?  Many supermarkets have forever annoyed the living crap out of me.  I cannot go in there and deal with people.  Everything from the woman that will leave her stupid cart in the middle of the aisle as she's, like, slowly looking through something.  And I come up with my cart and I'm thinking, what in your right mind would make you stop your cart in the middle of the aisle and not move it over to the side so people can get through?  Are you the only idiot shopping here?  Everyone's too selfish for me to want to interact with, and that's what it comes down to. 
[00:28:00]  I make sure I do things.  If you're just driving and you're pulling up to a light, and I always look in my mirror, and if some guy's got his right blinker on, I will pull as far over to the left as I can so he can get past me and make the right on red.  Why inconvenience him?  That never happens to me.  There's no one that ever does that.  People are too selfish and self-centered for me to want to deal with.  So anything I can do online, I'm going to do. 
[00:28:30]  Screw them.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We're just getting started.  It's the O.B. Anthony Show.  I'm proud of you and my company.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Herbie and Anthony just got me wild.  I just got wild.  We'd tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't plug the website.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  On 92.3.  Free of them. 
[00:29:00]  Jimmy's loving this.  He's not.  And it's not even Air Guitar Friday.  What's going on?  Today's Hip-Bop Wednesday.  Come on, everybody.  Everybody.  Everybody.  You hear everybody.  Come on.  Hey, I think I did my scream.  There it is.  I don't have to do it on, what's Tuesdays again?  Rock Scream.  Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[00:29:30]  Rock Scream.  Rock Scream.  Rock Scream.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.A. virus spreading across America.  I know we want to talk about the kids in Disney.  It's a big story today.  Yeah.  Well, we got to do the birth control story because we were laughing our asses off in the office.  We will never grow up.  I think we realized that years ago, but the local news, I guess there's a new birth control pill.  Yeah.  And I guess it could take away the period.  Can you say that?  Probably not. 
[00:30:00]  No, you can.  Yeah, why not?  All right.  It takes away that time of the month forever for women.  Right.  This new birth control pill, supposedly.  Well, what made us laugh in the back office getting ready for the show today, they had  to do their montage of women walking the streets, and they just filmed them from the back.  Yeah.  Assuming that they all were having that time of the month, and we were giggling like Beavis 
[00:30:30]  and Butthead in the back office.  It was really an odd thing, and we've talked about the B-roll that they shoot for certain  stories.  When it's the fat story, you will see fat people from the neck down.  Just big, huge bellies and big white asses.  They don't show their faces because then they'd need releases, and they'd have to say, hi,  we're doing a piece on fat, disgusting messes walking down the street.  But someone out there is recognizing themselves going, oh, great, that's my beer belly for  the cholesterol story.  Or worse yet, other people are recognizing them and calling them. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  Hey, did you see you on TV?  I saw you.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, they were doing a big fat ass story, and you were on there.  And they were doing a story on, yeah, the pill that...  Takes away that...  It's a birth control pill.  Sure.  It takes away the time of the month.  Supposedly forever.  That time.  Because some women have a real tough time with it.  And then I said, too bad it doesn't take the attitude with it.  Wap, wap, wap, wap.  So, yeah, they were doing that piece, and they had the B-roll footage, and it was all 
[00:31:30]  women, mostly in skirts, from the back, walking away from the camera.  Yeah.  And I'm like, what are they going for here?  Right.  Like, what is their...  And I know the first thing that popped into my head was, you know, some scene that might  be kind of reminiscent of a Freddy Krueger movie.  I was going to go with Grindhouse again.  Or Grindhouse.  Yeah, yeah, something like that.  You know, what are you supposed to...  Imagine you're going to see something any second?  Well, the news is assuming all the women that they filmed for this piece are having that 
[00:32:00]  time of the month.  Yeah.  Which made us really start laughing.  Then we were just vocalizing what was in our heads, like, well, stuff we probably can't  say right now on the radio, but you can imagine.  I think it's a great thing, the anti-period pill.  I had a girlfriend once who, every month, it wasn't a bitchy thing.  And she would be in the fetal position, like, like, like she was shot. 
[00:32:30]  You're going to be okay.  Yeah.  You're going to be okay.  That's what she was like.  She would roll up in a ball and cry in pain for like a few days with the pain of these cramps.  Who?  This girlfriend I used to have.  Oh, man.  And it was just like, oh, God, here it comes.  Here it comes.  Three days of a girl with a gut shot wound.  That's all it was.  And if this helps them out, fine. 
[00:33:00]  And you don't find out that baggage until later.  Like, they kind of hide from you during that time at the beginning of a relationship.  And then once you're in, you're kind of locked in a little bit.  And then it's like, oh, well, I'm kidding.  And I think someone should give us the handbook a lot earlier.  Yeah.  Like, the first time I found out that that's what happens to women, I was beside myself.  Oh, you mean the actual physical part of it?  Oh, yeah.  Like, they should tell you, like, in kindergarten. 
[00:33:30]  When did that?  You just learned.  Get you prepared.  Last week.  Yeah.  About a year ago.  Mother blood.  No, I'm in.  Yeah, that is kind of a creepy thing when you first find it out or figure it out.  It's like.  Or if it surprises you.  They do what every month?  Yeah.  What?  Well, they realize that they told you in kindergarten homosexuality would shoot up 85%.  You'd go, there's no way I'm dealing with that for the rest of my life.  Come on, let's help each other out. 
[00:34:00]  Come on.  What do you say?  Me and you.  Locker room.  And then you had to secretly admit that women might just be stronger than us.  Because guys can't handle that.  Some girls, though, they really have a hard time with it.  Others, it's nothing, you know?  But some girls, they just roll up in a ball and weep for three days where it's like they're  being stabbed in the stomach.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  So.  Is it wrong for girls like that?  You go over and you poke her in the back and go, toughen up and unzip and go, this will 
[00:34:30]  cheer you up.  Walk it off.  Walk it off.  After this.  Right.  But the montage was hilarious because they were just assuming all these women were having  their time of the month and we were just saying just horrific things.  Yeah.  That office.  We had to roll tape there and never play it.  Yeah.  You could play the home version of the Opie and Anthony show and imagine what we were  saying.  Yeah.  As they were wearing just little skirts and stuff.  All right.  Anyway.  Sexy.  Good morning, Craig.  Well, the pill is called Libral and it works like any other daily birth control pill where 
[00:35:00]  you take it in every day.  But this pill stops your period completely.  It is the first of its kind.  The FDA approved a birth control pill that puts a stop to a woman's monthly period.  The pill called Libral is taken daily and contains 20 days of hormones that prevents  women from ovulating and becoming pregnant without a menstrual cycle.  According to the pharmaceutical company that makes Libral, 59% of women who took tests had 
[00:35:30]  no bleeding after six months.  But about 18% of testers dropped out because of spotting or breakthrough bleeding.  Still, this is welcome news to many women.  About 12 million of them take birth control pills.  There are already pills on the market that give women a shorter monthly period or a period  four times a year.  It's like the elevator scene out of The Shining.  Basically, insurance companies are going to be able to cover this under your insurance. 
[00:36:00]  We're just so immature.  It's not even funny.  I love it.  And then she stumbles to the end of the story here.  Still, this is welcome news to many women.  About 12 million of them take birth control pills.  There are already pills on the market that give women a shorter monthly period or a period 
[00:36:30]  four times a year.  Hold on.  So Libral will be available in July by prescription at drugstores like this one all over the country.  In the meantime, the health department says that basically insurance companies are going  to be able to cover this under your insurance plans.  We're live at Basic Queens.  I'm Patricia Lopez.  The CW 11 morning news.  Okay.  I wasn't sure why they gave me the end of the cut again, but the reporter just stumbled to  the end of the story.  Yeah, she was kind of like...  We love pointing out when the news people just stink. 
[00:37:00]  Bumbling.  She was bumbling.  Can't do their one job, which is to read.  That can't be too...  I don't know how they put pills out like that.  That's kind of a very natural thing that is supposed to occur in women and...  Isn't that your body cleaning itself out?  Yeah, yeah.  That's another thing.  I thought that was kind of a cleansing process for the uterus and I don't know.  It just seems eesh.  Then again, they can give heart pills and brain...  Whatever they give you, all kinds of... 
[00:37:30]  That's maybe one more thing they can just fix.  Yeah.  Maybe that's just a defect in nature.  Yeah, but is that something you're fixing?  It's like some natural thing.  Oh, yeah.  It's something you're fixing.  Is it?  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  You don't like that time?  Oh, man.  What is this?  Hmm?  Ah, all right.  Moving on to Disneyland, Disney World.  I don't care if it looks like...  You ever see that old shot of Lincoln's pillow?  They brought him from the theater to the little hotel room? 
[00:38:00]  I don't care if it looks like that afterwards.  We got Coke Logic checking in from Whack Bag.  When Opie found out women have a cycle, he climbed up an apple tree again.  Yeah.  Very good.  People remember everything.  Well, see...  Opie climbed the apple tree.  I was a very innocent boy growing up.  Extremely innocent.  Yeah.  Grew up with a very strict mom, so I didn't get to really explore.  Just kind of had to keep it close to the vest. 
[00:38:30]  It's not a lot of knowledge as far as...  No, I just played my basketball every day, and there was a whole world going on, you know,  past my driveway, but, you know, to ask permission to get past my driveway was basically a nightmare.  Yeah.  So I matured a little later than most, and when I found out about the whole sex thing in Washington Drive School in 5th or 6th grade,  I was horrified, and I ran home, and I ran up into an apple tree, and I stayed there all afternoon long. 
[00:39:00]  Climbed an apple tree.  How all-American and perfect.  I know.  That really is.  Norman Rockwell painting.  Well, what horrified me...  I know we've told the story a bunch on the air, but it's worth bringing up again today.  You know, you're just a little kid playing soccer and wiffle ball and basketball and doing your little art projects,  and not much heavy lifting going on, especially in grammar school.  It's pretty easy, right? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And then you go to school one day, and your whole freaking life and world changes.  All of a sudden, they're like, oh, we're going to do something a little different today.  And all of a sudden, they separate the boys and the girls.  I'm saying something that a million people understand.  And then you march into the gym in single file, you know, guys on the right, women, girls on the left.  There's a door in between you.  The big accordion door is shut.  And they show you the film.  We need the music.  The film.  The film.  Dana!  Yes, you know what that film is. 
[00:40:00]  Well, actually, a lot of people don't until they start it rolling.  They're like, oh, what is this?  We're going to watch cartoons?  Well, you're suspicious, though, because you're like, all right, why is it just guys,  and why are the girls on the other side of the door?  All right, so far, we know we're seeing a film.  What could possibly, what could this film possibly be?  Yeah.  That the girls aren't allowed to watch it?  Oh, well, let me watch it.  Oh, no.  This is, this is the movie. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, no.  I heard about this from the older kids.  And then these cool bastards, they tell you about stuff that you're not even going to  be allowed to do for another six years in general.  Yeah.  Unless you're a lucky little fella.  You're going to have to remember all this info for when it actually comes about.  Yeah, you're like 11 or 12, and they're telling you about this new world out there, but you  can't touch this new world for another five or six years if you're a good Catholic. 
[00:41:00]  And there are always the kids with the creepy families who are pointing out what's wrong  with the movie.  Yeah, right.  No, this is crap right here, what you're saying.  Yeah.  I'll tell you how to deal with this situation.  Well, those were the hippie families that, you know, walked around their houses nude and  stuff.  Oh, I've seen this crap already.  You'll start to notice hair growing on certain parts of your body.  And girls, you'll notice you'll start growing breasts.  They show some little fella trying to shave for the first time. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  This is where hygiene becomes very important.  Explaining what whiskers really are.  You're going to have to wash every day.  Your body is changing.  Wash your arms.  Yeah.  Under your arms.  Your body is changing.  You'll notice hair growing on places that didn't have hair before.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It's, oh, it is.  This is embarrassing.  And if I'm not mistaken, back in the day, because we're a little older, we got to see  a little nudity with our film.  Yeah, it was like cartoon nudity.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't see any real nudity.  We used to have to, like. 
[00:42:00]  Cartoon nudity was the bomb, though.  Invade the library to try to find, like, real nudity.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes they'd have those.  Nowadays, I guess they really kind of weed that out.  But books in my library and, like, even elementary school, if you were clever enough and kind  of took enough time to really look, you could find naked girls in there.  I used to find naked stuff in dictionaries.  Biology books?  Dictionaries.  Dictionaries?  Yeah, little sketches.  The little sketch?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Would you look up, like, V, A?  No. 
[00:42:30]  You wouldn't?  Well, I'm sure.  And then there'd be, like, a picture of it?  No, I'm sure I did.  I'm trying to remember what would get you to the naked sketches in the dictionary.  Maybe something about pregnancy or something.  So then you have a sketch of a pregnant woman.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  Encyclopedias were good also.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they used to have the entire encyclopedia set in the library.  Yeah.  And you'd just break out one of those.  Make like you're studying something, you know.  Make like you're studying, I don't know, Virginia.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  And then you'd pull out the old V.  Change a letter or two.  Yeah.  Call me at where's the C volume in the encyclopedia.  So then they, uh, grammar, what birthday is this?  Grammar school.  Grammar school.  Oh, nice.  It's like you're the little rascals.  Wow.  Well, people usually say grade school or just, um.  Grammar school, I would say.  Grammar school?  Didn't we just say.  I never called it grammar school.  I think we used to say grammar school growing up. 
[00:43:30]  I called it elementary school.  Elementary school?  It was elementary school for me.  Yeah.  And then, uh, you know, middle school, junior high, high school.  Whatever you call it.  Anyway.  Grammar school.  That's the same.  That, I picture the single, uh, school house with Little House on the Prairie kids  going.  So.  So then the film is over and then the, uh, then the, uh, gym teacher or whoever the  hell showed us the damn film, uh, in grade school said, well, we instructed  your parents, uh, if, you know.  To, to ask you about the film and to help you along and, and help answer some of the 
[00:44:00]  questions you might have after seeing this film.  And that's when I, and then they gave us the rest of the day off cause it was, this was  heavy lifting for an 11 or 12 year old.  You can't wrap your mind around it.  You can't go, you know, to gym class after that and, and, and, and throw the huge ball  around or climb the ropes or anything.  And this was, this was, this was a serious day.  So it was a half a day for everybody.  And I ran home cause, uh, my house was close to, uh, Washington drive school out there in  Centerport.  And, uh, and I proceeded cause I knew my parents knew that I saw the film that I had to run 
[00:44:30]  up into the apple tree.  And I stayed there for the rest of the afternoon and my dad was at the bottom of the tree.  I'll never forget it.  Trying to coerce me down.  Talk you down.  Saying it's not going to be that bad.  We'll keep it quick.  Cause I guess they were supposed to talk to you every single, and I'm like, man, I don't  want to deal with this.  I just want to play my basketball.  I'm not ready for this, man.  I had a similar experience cause I went home and asked my dad, uh, I said, uh, dad, I have 
[00:45:00]  a question.  And he goes, yeah, your mom is a, I was like, Oh no, that's not what I, yeah, your son just  came in here and he's asking me questions.  But why don't you shut up?  You ass face.  Oh, give me a break.  You, you bitch.  Where's my whiskey?  Oh, I saw a movie in school and I need help.  This is because of you, Ro.  This is why he cries all the time.  It's your fault, Ro.  Oh my God.  Joe, he's sensitive because you're yelling all the time. 
[00:45:30]  Don't f*** yourself.  What do you want to know?  Yeah, I threw my c*** into her c*** and you came out.  That's all you need to know.  Stop your crying.  You're like a goddamn c***.  Get.  That was my question and answer period with dad.  Then I think he threw some food against the wall.  And went out to.  I used to think that's how you served food. 
[00:46:00]  Just, I, it was the first time I actually, uh, liked a girl and cooked for her.  I lobbed it against the wall to show my love.  A little uncomfortable there, right?  Yeah.  What are you, on the same cycle as your mother, your fruit?  Daddy.  I have a question.  Where do babies come from?  Why do you have to ask your one?  You're crying like one.  You're a grown man.  You're seven.  Get a job. 
[00:46:30]  But I'm only seven.  Have a shot, you puss.  Where do we go to the ball game, dad?  Can we go to the Met game?  They're playing at Shea.  No.  I'm busy.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  I gotta go to the bar.  I'm going to see my gumar.  Just trying to get some strange.  Babies, they come from your mom's b***h.  Hey, all you need to know.  Run into my room. 
[00:47:00]  Slam the door.  Cry.  Don't make me come in there.  I'm crying already.  Why would you hit me?  Why hit me, daddy?  And he used to hit me with his belt.  Yeah.  And he'd have to say things as he hit me.  Like, don't you ever do that again, B.  I understand the concept of the syllable, dad.  You don't have to beat it into me with your belt. 
[00:47:30]  And you don't have to add more syllables.  Yeah.  Because you were very bad today.  And I don't think that was the proper thing for you to have done.  Ow!  Dad, you're a little wordy.  Dad, yeah.  This is quite a wordy beating.  Ow!  You used to be angelic!  Angelic?  Angelic.  Now you're just a f***ed get.  Can you give me the cliff notes beating, dad? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, please.  Could you edit this down?  I'm really hurting.  You need an editor.  My hiney's hurting from your belt.  It's not a puppet, Roe.  It's a doll.  Oh, that one I had to deal with.  What?  Oh, I was making a puppet when I was a kid.  I wanted to make a puppet.  A marionette-type puppet.  So I took, like, some paper towels and masking tape, and I made a puppet. 
[00:48:30]  But I hadn't had the string and the wood to make it a marionette yet.  Right.  I was a kid!  Anthony, a little something about Anthony.  He's obviously highly intelligent.  Thank you, Opie.  And he never graduated high school because, probably because of his family life.  And he...  I had to smoke a lot of pot.  Over the years, he would tell me about his science experiments he used to do as a kid  and how he would take things apart to see how they worked.  Like, he was very, very...  Alone.  Alone. 
[00:49:00]  You were very adventurous, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I would build things and take things apart.  You probably could have been something really, really big.  Yeah, I could have been.  Instead, I'm here.  You should have been the little girl from Sixth Sense.  So you were making a puppet.  I was making a marionette puppet.  And I didn't have the string.  But I kind of made it, and I was kind of proud of it, and it was fun to, like, play with.  And I wanted to take it because we were all going to the store.  So I took it with me into the car. 
[00:49:30]  We all hopped in the car.  And I took it out of the car once we got to the supermarket.  My father goes, what are you doing with that?  I go, it's a puppet.  I'm taking it inside.  He goes, it's not a puppet.  It's a doll.  You leave it in the car.  I'm not going to have my son play with a doll.  And then told your mom it was a doll.  And my mother's just like, Joey, it's a puppet.  Ro, it's a f***ing doll.  You want him to be a f***ing get?  It's a doll, Ro. 
[00:50:00]  And I'm like, it's a puppet.  I just need the string.  Yeah, you need a string?  A f***ing string.  Do I have to beep that?  No.  Who knows?  Of course not.  They come with strings.  Well, you wanted a p***ing.  A tampon.  A beep string.  You wanted the puppet to kind of have that imaginary world around you.  Yeah, it was me and my puppet.  Well, the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.  Little boy blue and the man on the moon.  When you're coming home, son, I don't know when. 
[00:50:30]  But we'll get together then.  Dad.  No, we won't.  You cry, baby.  Oh, was I always weeping?  And then we'll have.  Always.  And then you'll have a drink together.  My father yelled at me so bad when the car overheated and flushing once.  It was pouring rain.  The car overheated.  It stalled.  And I was crying my eyes out.  And he's aggravated because it's pouring rain.  He's under the hood.  And I'm just.  And he's like, what's wrong?  Would you shut him up? 
[00:51:00]  He's just upset, Joey.  What upset?  He's a f***ing fruit.  He should have used your tears to throw into the.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me hold him over the radiator and just squeeze the tears out of him.  At least we could use these tears for something useful.  Oh, I got a cramp in my leg once.  And it was so bad.  And I was a kid and I just screamed bloody murder.  It was the first time it ever happened. 
[00:51:30]  And it felt like I was stabbed in my leg.  And I screamed.  I was like.  And he goes, what's the matter with you?  I got a pain in my leg.  He goes, it's a cramp.  He goes, if you ever make a f***ing sound like that again, you better have an arrow in you.  What a baby.  No, no, no.  Just a baby.  I'm waving off that pitch.  That is really funny.  No, my father didn't rip the puppet up.  But I think I did take it inside with me. 
[00:52:00]  And my mom's like laughing at my father.  For me, it was just a matter of, oh, I get to take my puppet with me.  But between my parents, it was my mother going, I won this one, ass.  I won this one, Joey.  I know your mom pretty well.  She's an awesome lady.  I'm sure.  She's changed like light years from back then, too.  I'm sure behind closed doors, she like kind of gave you your puppet bag and said, it's  okay, Anthony.  It's okay.  It's a puppet.  Here's your puppet.  You do whatever you want.  It's a doll, Rosemary. 
[00:52:30]  Doll.  Well, it's a puppet.  I should have just turned gay just to really screw him up.  Should have turned.  I guess you didn't have an open mind as far as that stuff goes, huh?  Nah, not really.  My father was so old school.  It was just ridiculous.  Talk about a lack of tolerance.  Jesus Christ.  I heard words that, by God, I still use.  I mean, I heard.  No, it's growing up in that house.  You heard words that they haven't even invented yet. 
[00:53:00]  For things.  Believe me.  All right.  We got a break.  We do, but I was having fun with this show.  We're going to break, Anthony.  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony and old Jimmy Norton who's going to be at the Stress Factory this weekend.  Thursday through Sunday?  Prepare to be wavs.  What?  Knockers.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on 92.3.  For ya.  Free FM. 
[00:53:30]  Hello?  Yeah, Hope.  You can hear me?  Yeah.  All right.  Where are you?  Well.  I didn't time this one too well.  It's Opie's birthday.  Yeah.  And I think he's just a little nervous.  Are you scared in there?  Are you nervous behind that door? 
[00:54:00]  Do you have the birthday boy blues?  I'm sweating like you wouldn't believe.  It's a little echoey.  I don't think the acoustics are as good in that room as they are in the studio.  No, no, no.  A lot of tile?  Why don't you guys do a little bit or something?  A little riff a little bit?  Yeah, why don't you riff?  I'll just listen.  All right.  Because that's all I do anyway, right?  Well, okay.  It's Fleet Week here in New York City. 
[00:54:30]  That was Dan of our riff.  All the big ships are coming in.  Oh, boy, they are.  Between the Verrazano Bridge and the GWB, the George Washington Bridge.  A very big event here.  It's where the Navy comes in and docks their ships.  And the sailors come out and try to steal your girlfriends.  My girlfriend always likes she's weird.  She's like, Fleet Week is really cool.  Because at the end of it, I have a lot of money. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know what she does.  What is she doing?  She loves Fleet Week.  She kind of walks uncomfortably into the apartment with a handful of cash.  I'm like, well, she must sell trinkets.  And then she goes, no, don't kiss me.  It's hot out.  I've been sweating.  Let me shower first.  Yeah, and then she gargles with kerosene.  Is there a backup with the boats up near the bridge?  A backup?  Yeah.  No, I don't think there's any backup.  I think they're flowing pretty smoothly.  Really?  Yeah.  Sailboat after sailboat.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  They're just, you know, there's some destroyers.  You know about any destroyers, though?  A few subs.  Some destroyers have been in the water.  Oh, yeah.  A few subs.  Any submarines?  Marines?  Let's just put it this way.  There's a lot of dinghies.  So you're talking more smaller craft than larger craft.  Oh, the river is just filled with dinghies.  Dinghies?  So many dinghies. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, that's a shame.  I would have liked to have known that some of the bigger ships were making their way down  river.  I'm not a fan of dinghies.  I'm a fan of the big barge.  The big bargers.  Yeah.  The big barger ship overturned outside of Turks and Caicos.  Hey, Disney, huh?  Hey, how about that Disney, huh?  How about that Disney?  So are your legs numb yet?  Oh, my God.  Are you going to walk out of there like a newborn fawn?  He's like Glover.  We're going to have to tackle him off the toilet into a tub. 
[00:56:30]  That spicy food was not a good idea.  What spicy food did you have?  Oh, just a little spicy food.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A little too much cayenne pepper?  A little bit.  A little bit.  What are you doing this weekend, Oprah, for your birthday?  Are you having like big parties and stuff?  I'm going to see Jim Norton at the Stress Factory.  No.  I mean, thank you, but that's not about my plug for the weekend.  I wanted to know what you were doing.  I think my girl has a fine day planned for me today. 
[00:57:00]  She better.  Well, after this nice romantic broadcast.  Yeah, and a barbecue at my brother's house.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, boring stuff.  Where, out on Long Island?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're invited to stop by the house.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Yeah, just if you can't use the bathroom.  Anthony invites us like where his mother-in-law is.  Like, yeah, no, if you're in town, just call.  You people.  I want a special invite.  Hey, bud.  I'm going to send out a written invitation.  By the way, Jimmy, I don't think his mom has even seen his house. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, no, mommy's been over.  Oh, yeah.  Dawn?  Yeah, yeah.  Dawn has come over.  Sal played some poker.  Yeah.  Yeah, my brother.  Who on the staff?  Than?  Than's been over for poker night.  Danny?  Yeah, a few people have come over.  There's not much, you know, as far as furniture goes or anything, you know?  I got a nice poker table.  A lot of nice chairs around the poker table.  But that's about it, you know?  I got a couch, but it's in the dining room because I am not done with the living room. 
[00:58:00]  I might be moving soon.  Finally.  When are you looking at moving in?  I don't know.  Maybe in a couple weeks.  All right.  Why don't you guys do a little something?  Are you all right in there?  No, I'm not.  I'm hearing like this, this kind of shaking in your voice.  You know what I did last night?  My girlfriend had never seen the JFK assassination or Oswald being shot.  Really?  I watched it on YouTube.  She's almost, she's 29.  She'd never seen. 
[00:58:30]  How did she react to that?  She laughed.  No, I'm kidding.  She was just, I mean, you're kind of desensitized now.  I mean.  Now, isn't that amazing?  Like when you first watched this Bruder film, it was like, oh my God, you're watching somebody's  head getting blown up.  You're all in the family now, I find.  Yeah, she watched, she's like, and I told her what happened to Oswald, she's like, he  got shot?  I'm like, how do you not know this?  Yeah, it was just on the news.  Jack, what have you shot on?  How do you, it was amazing. 
[00:59:00]  We had to watch it on YouTube.  Wow.  Yeah, she, she, she probably is desensitized, like you said, because there's so much stuff  on YouTube now where you could pop it up or break or anywhere else.  Good.  Very good.  I like hearing the water running for the hand washing.  After something like that.  Happy birthday to me.  Happy birthday to me. 
[00:59:30]  Happy birthday to me.  Happy birthday to me.  Jeez.  I've never heard him wash this much either.  Yeah, exactly.  What happened?  Yeah, what, did you have to use your hands?  I'm washing my back off.  The old riding the 10 speed through the mud puddle. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, wow.  He used to ruin a lot of shirts that way.  There he is.  Oh, this isn't too embarrassing to walk back out of there.  Oh, nothing was as embarrassing as when we did our, can we even say it?  What?  Remember, we did the competition to see whose sperm count was higher?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We'll do that again. 
[01:00:30]  And it was so embarrassing because we had to each independently, of course, go into a  room and complete the deed so the doctor would have a sample to then count how many sperm  cells were in the sample and the mobility of them.  And we were having a competition to see who would have the most.  You know what's funny?  So when we came out of the room holding that little frigging butter tub, that miniature 
[01:01:00]  butter tub with your essence in it.  I won.  Well, Anthony won.  But I want to redo it because I got a million of them.  I'll tell you what happened.  Anthony did win.  And this was a thing that was going on for about a week on a radio show.  And the doctor warned us.  We were pumping it up on the air.  The doctor warned us to refrain, refrain from having any type of, you know, what activity 
[01:01:30]  that is that because that could wreck the the count in the end, dwindle the supply.  And I couldn't help myself.  And I I've never told this story.  And I I couldn't help myself.  And I took care of myself the day before the day before the contest, you're ruined.  You wrecked your whole you trained for a week.  I think it was the early days of the Internet.  So, like, I just couldn't help myself.  And I swear to God, I that was rough. 
[01:02:00]  And I took care of myself.  I'm like, I know tomorrow's the day, but I just can't hold out anymore.  No, believe me.  I was like a 50 cal going off.  Yeah.  Wham.  What room did they send you into?  They have movies and magazines and stuff?  It was actually our office, which we get no respect.  We got no respect back then.  Our office was also the storage room.  Yeah.  So we'd come in and go to, you know, sit at our desk and there'd be boxes of, like, ink ribbons. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  All we wanted was an office and it was it was the supply closet for this radio station.  So we had like while the morning guy who's been there forever doing absolutely nothing had this really nice office.  And we were setting all of Boston on fire with our radio show.  And we get a supply closet.  Yeah.  And then the GM comes out recently to say that.  Ah, whatever.  We'll talk about that on another day.  He's just an ass.  Like he like he he knows how to.  Ah, whatever.  I got to stop myself right now.  We don't want to stop my. 
[01:03:00]  We had.  Didn't we have like headphones on to like I was listening.  I remember listening to the broadcast while I was trying to complete the deed.  Yeah.  There were magazines available, but it was so ridiculously difficult to complete the act and get the sample because you're listening to the radio show.  They're kind of goofing on the fact that you're in there doing that.  So it made it more difficult.  I remember.  It was really rough.  I remember I took forever and we had all sorts of material around us to get us going. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  And I remember what what popped into my head.  I'm like, oh, this will be a breeze.  No problem.  I'll go in there, get it done, get back on the show.  Right.  And I go in there and nothing is happening.  And then all of a sudden and I don't have that type of problem whatsoever.  OK.  But for some reason, nothing was happening.  And then all of a sudden, like what popped in my head was there is a lot of people listening to me right now because we were might.  Yeah.  Not to actually do the act, but just to have like the, you know, so. 
[01:04:00]  So Anthony could talk to me while I'm in there, whatever, just to make it into some good radio.  And and the thought popped in my head that there were a lot of people listening and waiting for this to happen.  And I'm like, and that's when when the panic set in and it took me forever.  Yeah, I remember that point.  We actually had timed everybody, too.  And it was I was close to an hour.  Yeah, it was.  I remember I was close to an hour.  I think it was around 45, 50 minutes.  Yeah.  And let's just put it this way for the next. 
[01:04:30]  For the next week.  Yeah.  A little less sensitive.  On the disabled list.  Oh, way on the DL.  I was way on the DL.  Like it would have mattered anyway, but I was on the DL as far as.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Why are we talking about that?  I don't know.  Just because it was embarrassing coming out of the out of the room with that sample.  Yeah.  And then having to walk in past everybody because it was outside of the actual studio. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Our office.  And so you had to walk in past the receptionist.  I remember everyone like clapping all the receptionists and the salespeople.  Yeah.  See, this is back in the days of radio when you could actually have fun and there wasn't a human resource department.  Yeah.  All that crap.  You could walk by with a sample of your seed right past the secretaries and receptionists and you might even throw some.  And they came out of their cubicles and lined the hallway and they're just clapping for you.  They're clapping.  It was great.  Yeah, sure.  Now you just have a lawsuit before you hit the studio again. 
[01:05:30]  Absolutely.  So someone on their cell phone on instant feedback.  Ope has rooster tails on his back.  No, it wasn't that bad.  All right.  You want to just break and regroup and we'll talk about Disney and other things?  Yeah.  Okay.  We have fruit.  We got fruit for my – wow.  Boy, Kenny, going all out for my birthday.  Thank you.  Oh, look.  You're getting sad.  A platter of fruit.  Yes, Kenny?  I can't take credit for this.  I didn't get you nothing.  I didn't get you nothing.  Who got us the fruit? 
[01:06:00]  That was your executive producers.  Oh, thanks, guys.  Wow.  Steve, he means.  That's nice.  That was very nice.  Steve.  A fruit from the fruit.  We'd like melon and some grapes.  Oh, you know, he was over there just making sure it was just so.  I'd like five pieces of pineapple.  Place it this way.  It's more pleasing to the eye.  He also likes blueberries.  But in all fairness to everybody, there was a big elaborate breakfast planned and something 
[01:06:30]  went wrong last minute.  What went wrong?  The guy had to cancel and he couldn't be here.  What guy?  Dude, what reputable guy was watching?  Who couldn't do breakfast for Oop's birthday?  Last minute.  So now we got like rotting fruit over there.  It's not rotting.  It's delicious.  It is very good.  I appreciate it, actually.  Why don't we do breakfast?  Well, I don't appreciate it.  I think the fruit stinks.  And there should have been a bigger birthday shindig for our birthday.  Yeah.  Why don't we do take... 
[01:07:00]  What?  This is the only day it's not your birthday.  You're just trying to hone in on your action.  This is the only day, and I want the message boards to hear me clearly.  There's only one day a year it's not Jimmy's birthday.  And it would be May 23rd.  It should have been a bigger day.  By the way, why don't we do take two on the old breakfast on Friday?  We'll do a take two.  All-out breakfast from somebody.  And we'll pay.  That's a good idea.  I'll chip in.  I want to know what happened this morning. 
[01:07:30]  I want to get to the bottom of this.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We're going to regroup.  I couldn't help myself, man.  Yeah.  Believe me.  I knew something was going on in there.  By the way, that's five.  Five so far?  And I've only been up three hours.  I don't know what the hell.  What did you eat?  Happy birthday.  Dude, it's a nightmare.  It just builds.  What do you drink?  Just like you go to a Chinese restaurant and just drink the mustard out of the packets?  What happens to you?  I had one over the weekend that I could compete with cows. 
[01:08:00]  Really?  It was beyond amazing.  I had to sit there and stare at it for a while in amazement like I was like four.  Like I was four or five years old in amazement.  And then there were tears in my eye when I had to like actually.  Tears in his eyes, I guess, as he looks at his last sample.  There were tears in my eyes when I realized I had to finally flush.  I really wanted pictures.  Why don't you get a camera and do it? 
[01:08:30]  I told you I used to do it with my Polaroid.  I would take photos.  And as a goof, just to annoy my mother and my friends, I propped them up on my dresser.  So you'd walk in and you'd see these two photos.  And then one time, my ex-girlfriend at the top, I was trying to bang my ex-girlfriend.  And she came over with her female cousin.  And I forgot those pictures were there.  And they walked in.  And the people are cousins like, what is this?  Oh, no.  And I'm like, oh, you had my friend.  It's such an actor.  Yeah, he's real funny.  I'll introduce you.  He was awful.  That's really funny. 
[01:09:00]  You're disgusting.  I know.  It's these stupid hours to answer your question.  Because I've been checked out on stuff.  And like on the weekends, it all just works like clockwork.  But during the week, when I can get one in, oh, I want to get that one in.  No matter where you are.  No, I don't care.  I don't care if it's in the middle of the radio show, in the middle of making out with Club Soda Kenny.  I don't care.  Making out.  G.H., are you okay?  I'll rub your belly. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  We're going to regroup.  And 25 cities.  Just heard this last 20 minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  About that.  We're brilliant broadcasters, aren't we?  Topey and Anthony.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  We tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't plug the website.  It's the O.V. and Anthony Show.  92.3, free FM.  Free FM.  Grabbing distance.  New York's 92.3, free FM.  We go to noon to three.  It's the O.V. and Anthony Show. 
[01:10:00]  Free FM.  Talk that rocks.  Where did Jimmy go?  You're checking out the O.V. and Anthony Show.  It's a virus.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  By the way, Anthony, it's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Oh, it is.  Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday is alive and well on Pal Talk.  Want to thank all the women on Pal Talk flashing us this morning.  I think you need to go to paltalk.com and get involved.  You get to see us doing the radio show, actually. 
[01:10:30]  We got webcams all over the studio.  Yeah, look, I'll wave.  There we go.  We're going to set up more webcams in the future.  And the women and guys, you know, they're at home doing their thing and they're watching the show as we do it.  And on Wednesdays, the women give us a nice treat.  They're flashing us like crazy.  And on Tuesdays, they do as well.  What?  They flash us all days.  Every day.  And, of course, it's alive and well out there on the highways all over America. 
[01:11:00]  You've got to get a wow on your car.  That's a sign for the women out there to flash you.  And there are women that will flash you.  The only thing we have ever asked is that you don't harass the ladies.  They don't want anything from you.  They just want to, you know, show you a little flash and then everyone moves on with their lives with a smile on their face.  She drives home. 
[01:11:30]  Everyone's happy.  Yeah.  And you've supported the show by putting a wow on your vehicle.  That's right.  Jimmy, where were you?  I was actually in the other bathroom.  I don't want to use the one in studio.  I don't blame you.  No, I don't either.  Let's get some yellow tape around that door for a while.  They're going in a Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  So I decided to, I want to take my nose strip off.  I've been doing that so I don't rely so heavily on it.  Oh, really?  What, did you get addicted to nose strips?  Well, I find that I just, I breathe better with it on, but then I have it on all day. 
[01:12:00]  The adhesive doesn't like make a mark or something?  That's why I take it off.  It does.  But I take it off.  I take a tissue, like a towel.  I put hot water on it and I slowly rub it off.  I have to kind of massage my nose.  He's sensitive.  No one cares.  No, that's not true.  Everyone cares about Jimmy and his breathe right strip.  What will happen is.  No one cares.  I'm a massage very slowly.  Who would care about Jimmy and his sensitive nose?  Do you know how many emails I've gotten saying, Jim, what about the red mark it'll leave on your nose at the Stress Factory this weekend? 
[01:12:30]  Hey, everyone knows it's Rock Scream Tuesday on Tuesdays.  Yeah.  But Roland missed out on Rock Scream Tuesday because he was sick.  I think he was avoiding Rock Scream Tuesday.  So, Roland, get your ass in here.  What is this gift? 
[01:13:00]  That is a Rock Scream.  What are you handing out, Roland?  I'm handing out.  Stop distracting us.  You're going to do a Rock Scream.  Fantastic Four Quarters.  It's not a real quarter.  Yeah, it is.  It's legal tender.  What is this?  That's pretty cool.  It's a Fantastic Four quarter.  Let me add it to $40,000.  $39,999.  Well, you just win a prize in all this.  Oh, can I?  Well, whoever finds my quarter that I just threw, we can have it. 
[01:13:30]  I'll put it in the little styrofoam thing that I put all my change in in the office, and it'll be gone in a week.  It'll be cool.  People will pilfer it.  I understand.  Who's pilfering my change?  I don't collect trinkets.  Trinket?  It's a trinket.  It is a trinket.  It's a who cares thing.  How about getting some of the Fantastic Four people in here?  Yeah, how about instead of a dumb quarter with the logo on it?  We're working on it for the next, they're in town in two weeks.  They stood us up last time.  We didn't like that.  Who hasn't stood us up? 
[01:14:00]  That's a good point.  I saw a list of everybody we said yes to recently, and all the no's next to their names.  Speaking of no's.  And how they passed on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's his name for the Sopranos?  Christopher.  Yeah, sorry we didn't let you band play.  Yeah, that was it.  He was supposed to come in, but he said only under one condition, that you'll let my band play.  I'm like, no.  We know you're from the Sopranos, and everybody else does, and that's what we want to talk about.  You want to plug your band?  Do it like everybody else.  Go out and play.  He didn't mind going to Channel 11 here in New York, which is just a local news station. 
[01:14:30]  They have, I'm sure, a nice amount of viewers, but they don't have as many viewers as we have listeners around the country.  I know they do.  No, of course not.  He wanted to sit there and do an interview with a hot chick.  Who was pulling some kind of mob gag, like trying to be funny like that.  You would have got a real interview here, and you would have been allowed to talk about your band as much as you wanted.  Stupid reps you have.  You've got what you deserved on the Sopranos.  That's right.  Yeah.  Only had to pinch that nose with both hands.  That's right.  That stupid show that everybody's watching. 
[01:15:00]  Hey, Roland, Rock Scream Tuesday, where were you?  I was sick with a cold and still sick.  Still sick.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People are off, just sick.  Do you know what the Rock Scream Tuesday thing is all about?  No.  Oh, we've only been doing it for a year.  Why don't you wake up?  A year?  A year.  A day.  Um...  Hmm.  Well, it's a...  There's a video up of some guy.  Steve seems to know him.  Ex-lead singer of Nitro.  There you go. 
[01:15:30]  It's like Steve's hero.  You hear Steve talk about him.  He's like, he's ex-lead singer of Nitro.  He's got an eight octave range.  He's just all excited about him.  Six.  It was six octaves.  Six octave range.  He could break glasses with his voice.  Yeah.  Wow.  And Steve, very excited about him.  And he's got a video of him doing this scream, a rock scream, an 80s rock scream, where he  runs through his range.  He goes from his lowest octave up to the rock scream.  And I got a little competition between the guys doing their rock screams yesterday on Rock 
[01:16:00]  Scream Tuesday.  And now, since you weren't in, we figured it's your turn, even though it's Wednesday.  Yeah, because you missed out.  Okay.  Yeah.  Now, would you like a little sample of what it was supposed to sound like?  We want you to imitate the following.  Yeah.  Make sure you get that at the end, too. 
[01:16:30]  You got to get that vibrato going.  Right, right.  You know, it's got to build and it's got to get really screamy at the end.  Vibrato.  I just said that thing at the end.  Vibrato.  Yeah, whatever.  All right.  You ready, Roland?  Yeah, I'm ready.  It's Rustic Tuesday on a Monday.  I'm rolling.  The hand was going like, eh, well, through the whole thing. 
[01:17:00]  He's just going, eh, God.  Yes, I'm doing it.  Oh, God, that was awful.  Yeah.  Roland, you had no confidence in that.  All right.  Do you want to try one more time?  I'll try one more time.  All right.  All right.  Belt it out.  Wait.  Wait.  Here's.  All right.  Here.  Listen to the example.  Yeah.  Thank you, man. 
[01:17:30]  You got to really.  You got to have a big finish.  Big finish.  Big finish.  You can't just go, eh, eh.  All right.  Here's Roland.  Brock, make this beat.  Out of one.  Sounds like Japanimation.  Terrible.  Oh, my God.  That's great. 
[01:18:00]  That's the best you can do.  That's the most excited you get.  No.  Stop being shy.  Just, like, go for it.  All right.  Close your eyes.  And we want to really hear you scream.  Yeah.  And the transition between the low to the high isn't really.  Move over, Roland.  This is what we're looking for.  Go ahead, Steve.  All right, Steve.  Next lead singer of Foundry.  Step it up to the microphone.  Big fan of the lead singer of Nitro.  Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr.  Do I do the low to high?  Oh, sure.  Whatever you want to do.  Right. 
[01:18:30]  Whatever you want to do.  This is what we're looking for, Roland.  A little energy.  Yeah.  He was upset with his performance.  As he should be.  Because he didn't time it right.  He needed just a little more air.  I saw what was going on there.  He thought he could pull it off.  He's very upset about it.  Yeah.  All right.  But see the energy there, Roland?  Yeah, I saw it.  All right.  Let's go.  Yeah, I saw it.  It's like a car with squeaky brakes. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, and there's no build or slide up to the note.  It's just two notes.  I don't even know why I find that really funny.  There's something about it.  The rock scream.  Hey, Roland.  Any movies out that you're excited about? 
[01:19:30]  I saw The X.  It was pretty good.  The what?  The X.  The X?  What's The X?  With Jason Bateman and Zach Barath.  Oh.  Okay.  And that's about it.  What is it?  What about Spider-Man 3 or Shrek 3?  I saw Shrek 3.  It was okay.  What's the one?  I mean.  Give us your review.  A little synopsis.  It was just the same thing.  Shrek and his donkey doing another adventure.  It's like a little cat.  Oh, my God. 
[01:20:00]  By the way, people, he's dead serious.  Oh, yeah.  That's his review of Shrek 3.  Shrek and his donkey doing another adventure.  Another adventure.  Another adventure with a cat.  With a cat.  Can't you give us a little more?  It's only the biggest movie out right now.  Yeah, well, the princess and him, they want to have a baby Shrek, and Shrek's not sure  if he wants to have a kid.  Who?  Shrek.  A baby what?  Kid.  A little Shrek or something? 
[01:20:30]  Shrek.  Shrek?  Shrek 3, reviewed by Schmuck1.  It's Shrek.  Yeah, Shrek.  Not Shrek.  Not Shrek.  Are you saying Shrek?  Yeah, Shrek.  He can't say Shrek.  Oh, my God.  Shrek.  Wait, say it again.  Shrek?  Oh, my God.  He's got a new one.  He's got a new one.  Oh, man. 
[01:21:00]  All right, concentrate.  What's the name of the movie?  It's the third installment.  Shrek 3?  It's Shrek the Third.  Yeah, how is it spelled?  S-H-E-R-K.  And that's pronounced.  Shrek.  That's stupid.  Like what you do with guest booking responsibilities.  Shrek.  All right.  All right.  So it's spelled S-H-E-R-K.  And how do you pronounce that?  Shrek?  Shrek?  Shrek, Shrek, Shrek.  Shrek.  He has no confidence.  Shrek, Shrek, Shrek.  It's just amazing. 
[01:21:30]  Shrek, Shrek, Shrek, Shrek, Shrek.  All right.  Well, all right.  And any other movies you've seen?  Nothing that you're excited about?  Uh, no.  Um, just like for the new Die Hard and that's, that's about it.  Seen the trailer for Rambo?  John Rambo?  No, I haven't seen that yet.  Wait.  You haven't seen the trailer for it?  Wait, you saw Die Hard though already?  No, no, no.  Oh, okay.  We're all getting screen passes and permanent things.  Yeah.  Ah.  And, uh.  Do you, uh, enjoy, um, the old, uh, Star Shrek series? 
[01:22:00]  Star Shrek series.  Star Shrek.  Trek?  Trek?  Trek 3?  Just say the name of the movie.  Yeah.  Trek 3?  Oh, my God.  We've told you five times how it's pronounced.  Trek?  Huh?  Trek?  Trek.  Trek?  Trek 3, right?  Shrek.  Trek.  I repeat after me.  What happens to your mouth? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, repeat after me.  It's Shrek 3.  Trek 3?  See?  He goes, Trek.  All right, now say it on your own.  Ooh.  Uh, Trek 3?  Oh, my God.  I could do this for an hour.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with him?  All right, it's Shrek 3.  Uh, Trek 3.  Trek 3.  Truck?  Trek 3?  Trek 3.  Wow.  What happens?  I don't know.  Can you say paper shredder? 
[01:23:00]  Paper shredder?  Sure.  He had to move his mouth a bit better.  He had to grind his teeth a bit better.  All right, we've got to get something done here.  All right, rolling.  Ted Rock's scream.  Yeah, not bad.  Not bad.  It was awful.  Well, we got, um, we got old cigarette ads.  We got Reagan Diaries.  We got John Mayer doing a little stand-up.  What do you want to do real fast?  Um, Trek?  Hmm?  Trek?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Trek?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm? 
[01:23:30]  Hmm?  Yeah, that's great.  I don't care.  Throw caution to the wind.  Pull one out of your, uh...  What does that mean?  ...hat.  Well, I mean, we were talking about, uh...  Actually, because we're going to take a break, and we're going to spend a little time on the  Reagan thing.  It's pretty funny.  We may even get a phone call from Mr. Reagan.  I hear a phone line has fallen on his grave, and it's obviously worked on the Twilight Zone.  Why can't it work here?  Um, and we...  The new cigarette ads are obviously telling the kids not to smoke, but there was a time 
[01:24:00]  when the cigarette ads were telling everybody to smoke.  Yeah.  You know...  Smoking was great.  Smoking was cool, man.  It was cool, and it, uh, soothed the throat.  Right.  Great.  They loved their tabacky.  Well, we're talking about the guy.  He's doing the voice box commercials.  Is that a national commercial, or is it just local?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But he talks like this.  And then they show him swabbing out his blowhole in his neck with a Q-tip.  Oh, ow.  He's just awful.  I can't even say that without...  It looks like it would burn, right? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Just constantly be an open wound.  A hole in your throat that you're swabbing with an alcohol...  Ow!  By the way, um, if, you know, everyone wants their big video to be huge online, uh, for  you smokers out there, have the commercial playing and have them swabbing out the hole as  you're enjoying a fine cigarette break.  A ciggy.  A ciggy.  Throw that up online.  You'll get some hits.  You'll get some fine hits on that one.  So, uh, yeah, back in the day, Chesterfield's, uh, had this. 
[01:25:00]  Chesterfield brings you the Perry Como Show.  All the top tunes on TV.  Pound up.  Pound up.  Pound up for Chesterfield.  Today, over a million cigarette stores coast to coast are featuring Chesterfield's.  The only cigarette that names all its ingredients.  The cigarette that's much milder with an extraordinarily good taste.  And most important, no unpleasant aftertaste.  Ooh. 
[01:25:30]  Much milder with a better taste and no unpleasant aftertaste.  The smart white packs, the ones you buy, millions say they're satisfied.  Pound up for Chesterfield's.  Pound up for Chesterfield's.  Pry a pack for Chesterfield's.  Let's do it.  How were we thinking as a nation?  Hey!  Isn't that amazing?  Who was thinking, like, that was, I guess it did work.  What a nation of nerds.  Yeah, just sheep.  God.  And they were the only cigarette that named all their ingredients, like we understood all 
[01:26:00]  these ingredients, you know?  Tobacco.  That's all that's in there.  Nothing that might addict you to it.  A million cigarette stores, the way they worded that.  Yeah.  A million, like, just stores.  It's the only cigarettes.  Right.  At your local cigarette store.  Every corner had a cigarette store.  It's just past the whites-only fountain.  Amazing.  How do you like your music, Giselle? 
[01:26:30]  Well, right now, Happy Joe, I'm in a bouncy mood.  Let's go.  Light up, a lucky, it's light of time.  Yeah.  How could cigarette smoking be bad if you got a fun little song to sing?  They all had great little ditties, didn't they?  Light up, a lucky, da-da-da-da-da.  Get some lung cancer, ya-da-da.  What do you got, Danny?  Danny's coming in.  Well, I just thought you guys should know that the guy, the male voice that you hear 
[01:27:00]  in that song, it's actually a cartoon character called Lucky Joe.  Oh, it's Lucky Joe?  Lucky Joe.  Yeah.  A cartoon character singing a happy song?  Of course you gotta smoke.  Remember.  What could be wrong with that?  Cartoons can't get cancer.  Light up, a lucky, it's light of time.  Light of time.  Happy, go lucky, it's light of time.  Wow-wee!  Sometimes I like my music dreamy like this.  For the taste that you like, light up a lucky strike. 
[01:27:30]  Relax.  For the taste that you like, light up a lucky strike.  Sometimes I like my music dreamy like this.  I'd imagine you'd want these jingles a little shorter so you can sing the whole song without 
[01:28:00]  losing your breath.  I have been busy, but I can't sing my songs like I used to.  Light up, a lucky, the Amazon.  How the hell do they get holy with this back in the day?  It's light up time.  Yes, sir.  Find tobacco that's toasted to taste even better. 
[01:28:30]  That's what makes a lucky taste so good.  You'll say it's the best tasting cigarette you ever smoked.  Who's talked about how it tastes?  That you like, light up a lucky strike.  Light love.  Light up a lucky.  It's light up time.  Whoever spoke like that for real?  A lucky.  A lucky.  Light up a lucky. 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  Light up a lucky.  Lucky strike will win the war.  Smoke a lucky and beat Hitler.  As you're trudging up and down in your uniform, toting a large rifle, smoke a lucky so you can  be out of breath while you're running from the Nazis.  And you know why they called it lucky?  It was an inside joke with the company. 
[01:29:30]  Because you were lucky that if you didn't get cancer.  Yeah, if you lived past like 50 years old.  Oh, that was their little joke, huh?  They have all the...  What's so lucky?  They have the little stories, too.  The lucky of you escaped cancer.  On these people that did these commercials, and so many of them just dropped out of cancer.  Just riddled with it from smoking.  The Marlboro guy, the old Marlboro guy that was on horseback.  Remember him?  Yeah.  Marlboro... 
[01:30:00]  Come to Marlboro country.  That guy just dead.  Oh, and he's a bitter man, too.  Yeah.  He was a bitter man at the end of his life, because, yeah, he finally passed.  His family wound up suing and got some money from the cigarette company.  I think we got time for one more here.  Yes.  Filter cigarettes.  Groovia.  Menthol cigarettes.  Man, this is Newport weather.  The perfect setting for the most refreshing cigarette of all.  Newport.  Refreshes while you smoke with a fine... 
[01:30:30]  Newport weather.  Dark clouds in your lungs.  Yeah.  Thunderstorms kicking in in your lungs.  Right.  A 75% chance of cancer today.  Oh, man.  They love that.  Newport, huh?  Menthol.  So now they're...  Newport.  Refreshes while you smoke with a fine white filter, menthol and milk, and great-tasting 
[01:31:00]  tobaccos.  Only Newport has this exclusive combination.  That's why Newport smokes fresher.  They always were about the fresher, crisp, clean smoke.  It's smoke.  You're sucking in smoke.  They loved their cigarette commercials, though, back then.  Well, we got Montclair filters and freshness.  Newport smokes fresher.  Oasis has the softest taste of all. 
[01:31:30]  And then Tarrington jingle.  What's that?  Tarrington.  That was the one I'd rather fight than switch.  Remember that campaign where they'd have the person with the black eye, and they're smoking  the Tarrington, and they'd rather fight that...  Whatever that came from.  I know.  Like, someone's willing to kick your ass to have you not smoke a Tarrington.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  And then everyone that smoked a Tarrington wound up getting punched in the eye, and so  they could smoke their cigarette.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you know what he's talking about, right?  Did you ever hear about that?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were talking about that.  Come on.  You don't remember I'd rather fight than switch? 
[01:32:00]  Me and Jimmy walking home the other day, just reflecting on the old jingle there.  Yeah, of course we know what you're talking about.  Remember Virginia Slims?  Well, those, yeah.  You've come a long way, baby.  Remember?  Because it was a woman's cigarette.  Do you got Virginia Slims on there, or no?  I'll get it after the break.  Oh, yeah.  You just sang the Virginia Slims jingle.  Maybe your dad was right.  To get where you got to today.  And it was like, you got your own cigarette now, baby.  You've come a long, long way. 
[01:32:30]  Roe, he's singing jingles again.  Roe, why is that singing cigarette jingles for our cigarettes?  Those cigarettes are made for bitches.  Like you, Roe.  Oh, Joey, shut your mouth.  Don't argue.  Don't argue.  Here, shut up and have a f***ing cigarette.  Man up.  Obviously, you want something in your mouth.  Man up and smoke a Tariton. 
[01:33:00]  My father smoked Taritons.  Oh, he did?  18 packs a day.  Really?  All right.  He was never seen without a Tariton in his mouth.  All right, then why don't we do the Tariton jingle here?  Would you say I'd rather fight than switch if someone said, look, I'd like to bottom for a while?  I'd rather fight than switch.  My father would rather fight than switch with my mom.  He smoked Tariton and gave her black eyes.  The taste is great in the filter tip Tariton. 
[01:33:30]  All the pleasure comes through in the filter tip Tariton.  Piano's annoying.  Smoke smilers.  Is that band?  You did this?  Smoke smoother.  Draws easier.  And the taste is great.  Just random words.  Coke logic is on fire today.  Cartoons can't get.  Oh, never mind.  I can't read that one.  Sorry, Coke logic.  That was the other one.  Wow.  But that was funny, too. 
[01:34:00]  Coke logic.  This is the one I'll read today.  These ads.  Wow.  Oops.  These ads make me want to smoke and ballroom dance at the same time.  It was a different time.  I tell you.  You should be able to smoke everywhere, too.  Hospitals.  You watch old footage and they're smoking in the hospitals waiting for a baby to be delivered or something.  Or news on a loved one.  Doctor, doctor, how is my wife?  And the doctor's smoking. 
[01:34:30]  She'll be fine.  I gave her a lucky strike.  It draws smooth and clean.  But, doctor, she's dying of lung cancer.  Oh, no bother.  Lucky will cure that cancer.  Lucky has exclusive cancer-fighting ingredients.  The only cigarette to fight cancer is lucky.  Carroters still exist?  Yeah, they all do.  Yeah, they're all still out there.  All right.  Chesterfield.  My nana used to smoke Chesterfield and leave those Chesterfield cigarette butts with old lady lipstick all over the place. 
[01:35:00]  Just all snubbed, stubbed out in the ashtray with a big lipstick on them.  One more.  I know we got a break.  One more.  Love these.  May I invite you to try the one cigarette that lives up to its name?  Talking to a 14-year-old?  You creep.  The cool green oasis on every peck promises you the most refreshing taste of all. 
[01:35:30]  The softest taste of all.  Just as the mist of morning dew refreshes a flower, keeps it fresh on them.  Holy crap!  He's equating it to a mist of morning dew on a flower.  Who the hell was in charge back then?  That's right.  Things will be growing in your lungs like flowers.  Cancer tumors.  Man, they got away with literally with murder back then. 
[01:36:00]  Just as the mist of morning dew refreshes a flower, keeps it fresh all day, so the tobacco in Oasis is misted, gently misted, all over with menthol.  The tobacco is soothed for the softest taste of all, and menthol misting makes it so.  Try Oasis.  But they were trying to lull you, like hypnotize you with that one.  Those are good commercials. 
[01:36:30]  They do make you want to smoke.  Does it?  Yes!  That's why they worked, I guess.  I want a smooth draw.  You want a smooth draw?  And a menthol mist?  Yeah.  Refreshes me.  Gets me ready for the day like dew on a flower.  I could use that.  Like dew on a flower.  Wow.  Yeah.  Gruesome.  We'll take a break.  We're going to get into the Reagan Diaries next.  Aha.  We have the books.  We've got a copy right here.  Autographed.  Yeah, sure.  I think it's embossed. 
[01:37:00]  What?  Embossed.  That's the, you could feel it.  It's not quite a real autograph.  It's just kind of his fake autograph.  And it's in all the book.  And it's embossed in the cover.  It's embossed in the cover, Jimmy.  Look.  Yes.  It's embossed.  Embossed.  Yeah.  I was going to say just grooved.  Don't be an Anthony.  I love showing my introverted fat guys.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:37:30]  On 92.3.  Free FM.  Hey, thanks for checking us out on this fine Whip them out Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  In a little while, we got another pair of tickets to see the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour at Jones Beach on June 16th.  I think we're about three and a half weeks out at this point, right?  We had a lot of fine discussions yesterday about things that are going to be happening in the village.  I think we're doing karaoke in the village, right? 
[01:38:00]  A lot of stuff, man.  Yeah.  I think we're going to do some kind of confessional video booth in the village.  Going to have another band maybe in the village this year.  And the Pess.  The ONA Pess.  Oh, they're listening.  And what's up, guys?  They're going to have their own booth in the ONA Village.  Yes.  And that's just the ONA Village.  Then you got the eight or nine comedians on stage.  You got Dance Dance Danny doing his thing live.  That I can't wait to see.  We're going to try to get I Swore the Sign girl to do her thing live. 
[01:38:30]  I think the big medians.  Yeah, right?  Try.  I think Danny doing the Dance Dance Revolution thing is great.  But if we could point out maybe a couple of people in the crowd and bring them up to try it, I think that would be great, too.  Okay.  Yeah.  You know what I'm talking about.  Huge fat people.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, well.  Preferably chicks.  Fat people are fun to mess with.  When they do Dance Dance Revolution, it's all the rage on YouTube. 
[01:39:00]  When you see a fat person doing Dance Dance Revolution on YouTube, I'm laughing my ass off.  Yeah.  Hey, we got an exclusive interview right now.  A guest?  Yeah, from the grave.  We're going to be talking to Ronald Reagan.  Wow.  From the grave.  From the grave.  Ronald Reagan.  How does that happen?  I don't know, Anthony.  How does it happen?  I don't know.  I can only imagine it's like the Twilight Zone episode where the phone line breaks and lays down on his grave. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  And you're able to get that connection for a while.  Look, you know, I know he's dead, but he doesn't have a lot of time to waste.  Oh, okay.  I got to take a...  Hey, Mr. Reagan, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I got to go to the bathroom.  So if...  What?  Just hold him on the line.  I really got to go.  Where are you going?  But I just got...  It's our exclusive interview with the ex-president of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan.  I just got to go to the bathroom.  He's like your hero.  I'm on the phone for a while.  All right.  Hey, Mr. Reagan.  Where's he going?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you, sir? 
[01:40:00]  Hello.  You have awakened the spirit of Ronald Reagan.  You have awakened me from my eternal sleep.  Hey, can someone put that on the curtain so I can believe this?  For this deed you have done.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Why have you awakened me?  I will come back and haunt your nightmares.  I'm only joking. 
[01:40:30]  How are you doing, guys?  We're doing all right.  How's death treating you, sir?  How's death treating me?  Yeah.  It's death, you idiot.  It's not supposed to be fun.  I'm dead.  But are you jamming with Jimi Hendrix or, you know, drinking with Jim Morrison?  You know, that old gag.  What are you doing in death?  Well, I hang out with the old dead presidents.  We all get together and hang out.  Yeah.  And some of them are just a hoot. 
[01:41:00]  Like JFK.  I've been hanging a lot with JFK.  He's the life of the party, let me tell you.  Why would he be the life of the party?  Well, he, uh, at the party, he's the one that goes around with the Doritos, and he fills his head with salsa.  Oh, my God.  And you just dip, and it's a hoot.  It's a real scream.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Hey, uh, is Marilyn Monroe giving you all lap dances up there? 
[01:41:30]  Well...  Or down there?  Where would, where are you?  Heaven?  Hell?  Uh, I believe Heaven.  Heaven.  All right.  Although JFK might say different, because he was, um, with Marilyn for many years.  Yeah.  And then, uh, Jackie O died, and now she's on his ass all the time.  You know, he needs that like he needs a ho-ho.  Oh, well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  He had it good for a while there.  Yes.  Yeah, about 30-some-odd years.  I have to ask, how's my wife Nancy? 
[01:42:00]  How's Nancy been?  Well...  I miss her terribly.  Well, um...  God, man.  Well, that saying is still big up here.  How's she doing?  Well, um, she was on, uh, Diane Sawyer recently.  Yes, I watched that.  Because, uh, you're...  Nancy, why the long face?  I died years ago.  Oh, just born that way.  I'll tell you, waking up next to her was like waking up next to an African medicine man.  With those big, long masks. 
[01:42:30]  Frightening.  You see her head?  Yes.  It looks like one of my jelly beans.  Just giant.  Stuck on a skinny little lollipop stick body.  Well, Mr. Reagan, your, uh, your diaries came out this week.  I got a copy right in front of me.  And thanks for signing my copy, by the way.  A little, uh...  Oh, I signed that, did I?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it's called him boss. 
[01:43:00]  You didn't know that?  Where's Anthony?  Where's Anthony?  I don't know where Anthony is.  He would know.  Yeah, he, he knows everything, sir.  Yeah.  Uh, you want to, you want to hear your, your wife for the first time in a long time?  Oh, this is a special moment for me.  I can't wait to hear her.  I hope I don't tear up.  Uh, no, you won't, uh, tear up.  Okay.  So she was, uh, she was talking about the, your diaries on, on TV the other day.  You know, I never wanted those published.  They didn't ask me for permission. 
[01:43:30]  Right, um, well.  Well, yes, I'm, you know, dead.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Um, here we go.  Nancy Reagan.  Your wife, sir.  Okay.  And now, memories in five volumes.  Handwritten.  Emerging from the library vault.  His diaries compiled into a book.  She sounds different.  I can hear him, I can see him.  Oh.  It's just Ronnie.  The first striking thing, the term of modesty, humility.  You dread the beginning of a busy week? 
[01:44:00]  So did the president.  Several times he says, I hate Mondays.  I hate Mondays.  Yeah.  A man so truly.  Get over it, bitch.  Jesus.  Well, there you go.  You're hearing her for the first time there, uh, Mr. Reagan.  Yeah, oh boy.  Thanks.  Well, she's on TV talking about you and, uh, your life together and your diaries. 
[01:44:30]  My diaries.  I hope she didn't read them all.  There are some entries that are a little embarrassing, like this one.  Met with Margaret Thatcher in England this weekend.  My God, I like her.  I really, really, really like her a lot.  It's like a junior high entry.  It's a diary, so you stick with the program.  Right, I understand.  Hey, here's, uh, more from your, for your, uh, from your, uh, your wife there, Nancy. 
[01:45:00]  A man so truly middle American, he couldn't bear to write out even harmless little swear words.  D, dot, dot, N.  He just couldn't bring himself to do it.  And his reaction to movies.  Officer and a gentleman.  Good story spoiled by nudity, language, and sex.  I know.  He just didn't like those pictures.  But he'd have a terrible time today.  What would he watch? 
[01:45:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, what would you watch, sir?  Yes, no, there were, like, I would leave some letters out, like this entry.  Yeah.  Today, Nancy's being a real C-U-blank-blank.  I wouldn't want to spell the whole word.  Yes.  You didn't like nudity in movies, I see, she's trying to say.  I wish she would S-U-blank-blank my C-O-blank-blank, but she never does. 
[01:46:00]  Well, it sounds like you were a gentleman.  You didn't like, uh, you didn't like the sex in your movies or the bad language.  That dirty language, I wouldn't, I would never use it.  No.  No.  Some of my diary entries, well, you know I died of Alzheimer's, you know.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Some of my diary entries, well, you know I died of Alzheimer's.  Yeah, we do know that.  Alzheimer's gag.  I imagine that you don't have Alzheimer's anymore now that you're dead. 
[01:46:30]  No, but my diary kind of shows some things.  If you look in my early diaries, I talk about, well, how the Soviet Union must be showed,  we as the country of the United States of America will not take their threats idly.  Yeah.  That's an entry from the early 80s.  Yeah.  Here's one from the 2000s.  I'm talking to a kangaroo and my shoes are made of pudding.  Kind of a drop-off. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  Just a bit.  Yes.  Well, we got more from your wife, sir.  Whoa!  Oh, please.  And at times the diaries even record embarrassment.  A very British Prince Charles visits for tea is served a cup with a strange device,  a tea bag, blasphemy.  And poor Charles sat there and didn't quite know what to do.  So he eventually put the cup down.  And after everybody had left, Ronnie said, was something wrong? 
[01:47:30]  And Charles said, well, I didn't know what to do with this.  His first tea bag.  Yes.  The great tea bag incident.  Well, yes, I remember when I tea bagged Prince Charles.  Oh, gosh.  That was embarrassing.  Yes.  Being caught tea bagging Prince Charles like that was a memory that sticks out in my head.  Yeah.  Oh, what's going on? 
[01:48:00]  They're calling me back to the grave.  Oh, oh.  I'm only kidding.  Jack and Bobby are having another party.  All the whores are invited.  You want to hear more from your wife here?  Oh, there's more?  Yeah, Reagan.  I didn't know.  I was going to go into the bathroom.  Well, in your diaries here, you refer to Nancy lovingly throughout the book.  I do?  Well, yeah.  I did?  Well, yeah.  And on every page, a president is also writing a love story. 
[01:48:30]  Over and over, he writes, even six minutes without Nancy was in eternity.  Nancy in California.  Did I put out in there?  Hold on.  I meant six minutes with Nancy.  It was a misprint, you dummy.  I guess the editor didn't catch it.  It was all about Nancy.  Yeah.  My wife, Nancy.  Nancy in California.  When you read a number of times, his diaries begin with missing you. 
[01:49:00]  Did that surprise him?  No, not really.  Sounds a little strange to say it pleased me that he missed me.  But we didn't like being apart.  Neither one of us.  Well, your aim was awful, sir. 
[01:49:30]  That old gay.  Yeah.  Even when he's angry, he says, I'm really steamed.  And then he goes right on.  Instead of like a long rant of any kind.  What's the angriest you ever saw him get?  Well, you always knew that he was really angry.  If he picked up his glasses and threw them on the desk, then you knew he was angry. 
[01:50:00]  And that was it.  That was it.  Wow, man.  You were pretty outrageous.  Yes, I'm a wild man.  Wow.  She knew I was angry when she couldn't be in front of the press for a week.  You know what I mean?  They called me Ronald Ike Reagan.  Ike Turner Reagan.  Sorry, forgot the Turner part.  I did, you know.  And I did have Alzheimer's.  Yeah, well, let's just slide on that one, sir.  Finally, one more clip from your wife. 
[01:50:30]  With the Diaries show, he always read newspapers and watched the evening news, no matter how critical the press,  which he held in a certain amused contempt.  And like any great performer, secretly pleased when he scored one against a pesky reporter.  Remember it, Sam?  Mr. President, in talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed mistakes of the past.  And you have blamed the Congress.  Does any of the blame belong to you?  Yes, because for many years, I was a Democrat. 
[01:51:00]  Here's what he wrote in his diary.  That was my favorite answer.  That was a hot one.  Yeah, they loved that one, sir.  I'll be at Bananas.  All week.  Catch me.  I'm doing an HBO special.  I killed him.  That stupid Sam Donaldson looked like a Vulcan, didn't he?  He sure did.  Mr. Spock.  Ugh, Nancy.  I hope she lives a long, long time. 
[01:51:30]  I really do.  Uh-oh.  She looks like a Team America puppet.  Oh, they're calling.  Yeah, see?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  There he goes.  There he goes.  Oh.  There he goes.  Contact me again.  I will.  Take it easy, gentlemen.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, hey.  All right.  There he goes.  The ex-president.  Ronald Reagan.  Just made it back.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Oh, Mr. President, this is so exciting. 
[01:52:00]  From the grave.  Mr. Reagan, I have so much to ask you about.  Oh, your life, your history, the afterlife.  What is the first thing you did when you died?  He's gone.  Hello?  Hello?  You missed it.  What?  I always miss him.  You missed our interview.  Oh, Jesus.  From the grave.  This stupid old guy.  All right.  We get it.  We get it.  Awful ready.  Next time you do that, we kind of, like, pull down the shade or something.  Could you pull down?  So I can believe it a little bit. 
[01:52:30]  I'm just looking right at you.  Who the hell were you talking to?  Oh, I was on the phone with something.  Very important business, Jimmy.  Very important business.  I missed the whole interview.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Whoa.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomies.  Wow.  It's whipping out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:53:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  On 92.3 Free FM.  Oh, Bud Light.  Yes.  Bud Light.  Oh, yeah.  Bud Light.  I love Bud Light.  Having my poker game tomorrow night.  Are you there with them?  Yes.  And there'll be, you know who else is going to be there?  Mr. Bud Light.  Ha, ha.  That's right.  My whole fridge full of Bud Light.  I love it.  And the people that come over, that's all they drink.  You want a beer?  Someone goes, beer? 
[01:53:30]  Get me a Bud Light.  Look for their custom Major League Baseball aluminum bottles available now.  Keep an eye out for your favorite home team.  And you're going to, what more can I say?  We drink it at my house.  Drink it at yours.  Be like me.  Be just like your pal Anthony and drink Bud Light.  Why don't you come over?  See, you could come over, Ope.  Jimmy could, well, not Jimmy.  You know, you don't partake.  I'll fill up a Bud Light aluminum bottle with some water.  Some club soda.  And you could drink that. 
[01:54:00]  Make like you're drinking.  Opie, you come over.  Have a Bud Light with me.  Always cold.  Always refreshing.  Always worth it.  Bud Light.  Drink responsibly.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  What else is America talking about today?  America.  Kind of another slow news day, actually.  We got the Idol finale tonight.  Whatever.  Jordan wins.  Hands down.  Who cares?  Move on.  Do you think?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Do you want to get busted again for drug testing? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's a big story, too.  Jesus.  They're calling him, well, it says, what a dope on the front page of the Daily News today.  Anyway, and you got the 60-year-old having twins on the cover.  I don't know.  Who's banging a 59-year-old?  That's what I want to know.  What's wrong with these people?  I would say a 79-year-old.  Oh, is he going to tell you?  A chippy for a 79-year-old.  Kids are going to have, their mother's going to be, when they're all left to drive, their  mother will be 77. 
[01:55:00]  Why?  That is selfish.  Of course it is.  I call it selfish.  Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco want us to look at them, and we're not biting for the  most part on this show.  They want us to believe that they're actually having some kind of relationship instead of  it just being a reality show ploy.  I'm not buying into that crap.  Let someone else do that story.  They're trying really, really hard.  They're trying to drum up some kind of publicity, and no one's really caring. 
[01:55:30]  No one cares.  No.  No one cares.  I'm not even going to tell you the latest, because I don't even care.  Every day they're giving you a little piece, though, just hoping that the mainstream media  is really going to run with this thing.  Look, look, look.  They're together.  Are they?  Are they?  It wasn't so many reality shows.  People might buy into it, but there's been so many.  People are like, ugh.  You get it.  Yeah, you just know where it's going.  It's a false premise.  More fake, scripted garbage.  And then this in the paper I thought was kind of cool.  Killer dies a Raider fan. 
[01:56:00]  You hear about this?  Yeah.  Arizona executed a man by lethal injection yesterday for the 1987 murder of a camper,  Robert Charles Kummer, 50, convicted of the murder of Larry Pitchard, was put to death  at 10 a.m. at the Arizona State Prison complex.  And you're saying to yourself, ah, whatever.  Who cares, right?  Yeah, another murderer bites it.  When asked if he had any last words, witnesses reported that Kummer smiled and said, yes. 
[01:56:30]  Go Raiders!  Wow, that's a great endorsement for the team, isn't it?  Guy being put to death for murder.  Go Raiders!  His final words.  Good for him.  And then they gave him the lethal injection, and he went to sleep.  Good for him.  He shot some guy.  He should have gotten no final words.  Should have been a slap to his mouth.  They always give him the final words.  They let him get the lethal injection.  Which, by the way, the guy that came up with the concoction of the lethal injection, is 
[01:57:00]  now kind of, he wants to rework it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because they kind of had him come up with it, and it's a real old formula that they  came up with.  And a lot of times, the people are still kind of alive as they can't breathe, and they're  suffocating and not asleep.  So, they want to take out the thing that makes you stop breathing, give them the thing that  puts them to sleep, and then the thing that stops their heart.  He goes, and then they asked him, why did you put in the thing that stops the breathing? 
[01:57:30]  He goes, I don't know.  He really said, I guess, I really don't remember why we even put that in.  So, they just want to go from the drug that puts you to sleep.  They actually put you to sleep.  Like, if they just used that first drug, you'd wake up and go, oh, thanks for that.  Great night's sleep.  So, they put you to sleep, and then they stop your breathing, and then they stop your  heart.  Kind of like, that's a cheesy way to get out of it.  You know, the old firing squad, where you had to stand there with the blindfolded going,  oh, when's it going to come? 
[01:58:00]  When's it going to hit?  Ready?  And you're just like, oh, God, this is going to hurt.  Oh, Jesus.  Or the gallows, where you're standing there.  And then, very surprising, the guy said, was asked if there is any capital punishment  that you would suggest as being the most humane, what would it be?  And he said, the guillotine.  He goes, you would have no problem bringing back the guillotine.  He goes, it's the fastest, quickest, feel-nothing execution that there is.  But it's kind of yeesh. 
[01:58:30]  But I imagine if you're going to kill that way, just the fact that your head's going  to roll away from your body, and you're going to see that for maybe a second or so.  So, you're getting freaked out beforehand.  Just remember to shut your eyes.  Shut your eyes.  Don't keep your eyes open, because then you're going to see your open neck.  You know, the head pops off and starts bouncing and rolling, and you know you're looking back  going, wow, that was my body.  And the worst thing would be your head hitting the ground, and maybe a little grain of sand  getting in your eye, and you're going, ow, I got something in my eye, and you can't  even get it out.  So, you're kind of suffering for that little moment. 
[01:59:00]  That'd hurt.  Look, you broke your nose.  Yeah.  Ow, you fall right on your nose.  Pod talk with O.P. and Anthony every Wednesday.  Pod talk Wednesday.  Pod talk Wednesday.  Pod talk Wednesday.  Hey, Helmet Boxing.  Yeah.  This is how stupid the news is.  Do we really have to tell you at this point?  They're just stupid, stupid people.  They show us all this stuff that kids are doing so more kids can do it, is what happens.  Yeah, I didn't know anything about helmet boxing, aside from what I learned as a kid, 
[01:59:30]  and it was only once with a good friend.  I know a lot.  I know a lot of kids.  Yes.  And I don't know any helmet boxers.  No, don't know anyone who was helmet boxing, never heard of helmet boxing.  See, the news, I don't know where their heads are at.  I don't know if they do these stories because they really want to, like, prevent other kids  from helmet boxing.  Or they're just doing it because it's shocking and makes for good TV.  Yeah.  But I think when you have a news story that shows helmet boxers and then shows you all 
[02:00:00]  the videos that are now online, because we didn't know.  I Googled it immediately, and I've checked out 10 freaking helmet boxing videos this morning  alone.  Yep.  Oh, that's a good one.  Wow, that kid is getting his head smashed in.  So thanks to the news, to the parents out there, some of your kids are going to now enjoy  the sport of helmet boxing.  That's what they do.  Yeah.  That's what they do as responsible broadcasters.  This just happened on the news.  Listen. 
[02:00:30]  A dangerous new trend is sweeping the internet.  It's called helmet boxing, and it's the new knockout for children.  CBS 2's Cindy Shue tells us.  It's the new knockout for children.  Knockout.  Oh, my.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Trying some comedy chops, are you?  Must be an open mic-er on the weekends.  Yeah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  The old knockout for children.  CBS 2's Cindy Shue tells us why doctors and safety experts say parents better learn the  rules.  For AJ Pacheco, school's out. 
[02:01:00]  Now he's looking forward to a summer full of friends, fun, and helmet boxing.  I first heard about helmet boxing from a friend at school who was on the hockey team.  It's an underground sport that's just coming to the surface.  Yeah.  It's coming to the surface because we decided to bring it to the surface.  Yeah, yeah.  No one knew about this, really.  I mean.  This was kind of a fight club thing that was going on.  Put it this way.  You knew about it if you watched YouTube and were kind of into it or stumbled upon it. 
[02:01:30]  But once they put it on the news, everyone knows about it.  And knowing kids, knowing the way I was also as a kid, you look at something like that  and go, oh, wow.  Wow.  We got to try this.  Check that out.  We only do headshots, only around the helmet.  No punching behind anyone.  No punching below the helmet.  A quick search on YouTube.  The helmet.  The helmet.  Sold up hundreds of amateur videos proving this game is leaving the locker room and becoming  a popular garage sport with kids as young as 13. 
[02:02:00]  Little kids beating the crap out of each other.  Nothing funnier.  I got to tell you that.  Nothing funnier than watching kid fights.  You can punch up kid fights, too, not even the helmet ones, and just watch kids fighting.  I went with fat kids fighting.  Fat kids fighting.  Hilarious.  All over YouTube and hysterical.  We talk about this on the show from time to time.  It's getting those just weird searches in.  And fat kids fighting is a great one.  Yeah.  And finally, more on helmet boxing.  AJ landed in the emergency room, needing 10 stitches across his chin. 
[02:02:30]  A brother who studies sports injuries says helmet boxing could also result in concussions.  And my concern would be if they get injured while they're home with boxing and don't realize  they have a slight concussion and go out on the field the next day and get another blow.  Boxers like AJ insist the matches are strictly horseplay.  But both our experts agree parents and coaches need to ask questions.  If parents know that this is going on, ask their sons or daughters, well, usually sons, I would guess, 
[02:03:00]  have they ever participated in this type of activity?  And so if an injury does happen, then the kid's more likely to come and tell their parents  and not try to hide it.  So there you go.  We learned about helmet boxing today.  They think helmets are going to protect them from a concussion.  Meanwhile, boxers get concussions not because of the exterior hit.  It's their brain actually hitting the inside of their skull.  Yeah.  Shaking around a little.  Rattling around in there. 
[02:03:30]  Than?  Making his way to a microphone?  What's going on, Than?  Well, here it comes.  It's a very special day around here.  We all know that.  We all know it's a special day for Opie.  Strippers?  For my birthday?  Strippers?  Sorry.  No.  No?  No.  No.  Well, let's do that.  Any type of nudity?  Flashing?  It is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  This is something, Opie's birthday, it's an intern presentation. 
[02:04:00]  Ugh.  Oh, God.  Your birthday cake, and they have something to do?  Yes.  All right.  Step one is the cake.  All right.  Let's...  All right.  Hold on.  Before we get into this, Jimmy, give away tickets, because we promised them a while ago.  Yeah.  As the interns are doing something for the birthday?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Be the 90-second caller, or fourth.  Random caller, whatever. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  You just want a pair of tickets to see our Traveling Virus, the Open Athlete Traveling Virus show  at Jones Beach, June 16th, and it's going to be a great show.  So call up if you want free tickets.  And if you don't win the tickets, you can get them through Ticketmaster.com.  Yes.  It's going to be a great, great day out there at Jones Beach.  Yes.  Eight or nine comedians you know and love from the show.  Yes, Sam.  Pat Duffy wrote a script and created a presentation involving all the interns for your special day.  A script.  He wrote a script and everything. 
[02:05:00]  This?  This better end like Jonestown.  All right.  Well, bring him in.  All right.  Oh, no.  Come on, Pat.  Does this mean we get to see Jared again?  This has to suck.  Oh.  His music?  Happy birthday to me.  Mm-hmm.  Happy birthday to me.  And here's your cake courtesy of everybody here at Free FM Radio.  Very nice. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  Wow.  A birthday cake coming in.  There it is.  All on fire.  By the way, a female intern carrying the birthday cake.  The first female intern we've had in about six years.  Oh, I was going to say ever.  No, we had that.  Yeah, yeah.  What's her name?  That was really cool.  So don't blow it.  Let us do our...  Literally.  Oh, why is she blowing out the candles?  Oh, is that part of the bit?  What?  Were you talking to a mic?  Well, there's just a lot of...  There's a lot of candles on the cake.  We don't want to say...  Oh, you're calling them old.  Why is there a lot of candles? 
[02:06:00]  Everyone knows I'm only...  She's 34.  28?  31.  What?  You want to foof them?  Oh, no, it's okay.  You can blow out my candles.  I say let the girl blow out the candles because I won't eat cake that the guy blows the candles  out on.  Even though I have no clue who you are or who you've been with or anything like that, I  still won't mind if it's a girl.  Yeah, because you know a little saliva gets on the cake.  Yeah, every time.  Right.  You see a little spit and it's like, I wanted a piece of goddamn cake and I saw a spit fleck.  Nothing better than grandma blowing out the candles and all sorts of crap flying out 
[02:06:30]  of her mouth.  Pop out, land in the middle of the cake.  That white stuff that gets in the back of your throat that stinks your throat.  Oh, my God.  It just reeks.  Parts of lobster she had like some kind of...  Stuck in her teeth.  Decided to dislodge onto your birthday cake that she had at a blue plate special.  A hunk of gums cancer.  Nicotine from a cigarette she smoked 20 years ago.  All right.  Here's their presentation now. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes.  Opie.  Okay.  All right.  Good morning and welcome back to the Channel 9 Morning Fun Time Super Variety News Hour.  I'm Slick McFavorite and with me as always is Chatty Hole.  Good morning.  Shut up.  Coming up in the next half hour, cancer.  Why, you probably already have it and now it was your lawnmower's fault.  But first, today marks the birthday of Opie.  And coming up in just a few minutes, we have the ultimate present for him.  That's right, Slick.  It's like the Opie's birthday.  So let's get down a list of memorable moments from these past 20-something years. 
[02:07:30]  Who could forget April Fool's Day, 1998, when it was reported by Opie that the mayor of Boston  supposedly died while on vacation in Florida.  Thanks, Opie.  But he was okay.  Oh, how we all laughed and laughed.  Then there was the voyeur bus.  In June of 2002, Opie sent a bus full of scantily clad ladies all around the city of New York,  showing off their goods to anyone who wanted to see them, but mostly to those who didn't.  And then there was Sex for Sam, in which a couple supposedly completed the two-point conversion  while in a pew at St. Pat's. 
[02:08:00]  Two-point conversion?  That's right, Slick, the two-point conversion.  I bet that girl will never play football again.  I'm sure she won't.  I think that the super-secret celebrity guests are here.  Should we bring them in, Shetty?  We should.  Coming in first, from Stuck on You, Jersey Girl, and the one episode of Will & Grace,  here is Matt Damon.  Oh, God, why?  Why is he shirtless?  Why is he shirtless?  Why isn't he always?  Of course, I'm sure this was Steve's idea to have the internet topless. 
[02:08:30]  Take your shirt off.  Great.  Matt Damon.  It couldn't be the female line.  Matt Damon.  All right.  And now, my personal favorite, from season two of American Idol, and the subject of his  own grainy sex tape, it's Clay Aiken.  Yeah, we do have an intern that looks like Clay Aiken.  Oh, why is his shirtless?  Why are they shirtless?  Why are they?  Who's the ass that decided they have to be shirtless?  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy? 
[02:09:00]  Why Pat Duffy?  That ought to be a little funnier, especially with the next guy.  Look, Steve's coming in.  I have to see the semi-nude intern.  Steve comes running in, making believe there's something to do in here.  I promise.  You should see what he's producing in the corner.  And last but not least, from the end season of Back to the Future Part 1, it's alternate  reality Biff Tannen.  Alternate reality Biff Tannen.  Oh, God.  Someone stole my body and put that head on it.  Oh, my God.  Look at everything jiggling. 
[02:09:30]  Wow.  And they're here to give Opie his ultimate birthday present.  Much better than a simple fruit plate, I'm sure.  Take it away, boys.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  They made a pyramid.  Happy birthday, dear Opie.  Happy birthday to you.  Ta-da.  That's how he pushed him off the top of the pyramid.  Pushed Clay Aiken off the top of the pyramid.  Pushed him off the top of the naked pyramid. 
[02:10:00]  That was a nice Abu Ghraib minute.  Yeah.  All right, wait.  Now they're turning around.  We love Opie.  Heart Opie.  Yeah.  Written on the back end.  And there's a circled zit on alternate universe Biff Tannen.  Jared's body.  They're still pointing out his...  What a friggin' mess.  Oh, worst birthday party ever. 
[02:10:30]  It really is awful.  One platter of fruit.  Three semi-nude interns.  One of which isn't the girl.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is why I take my birthday off every year.  Exactly.  Because it's nothing but disappointment every year.  Oh, worth it.  The people on Pal Talk, horrified.  Is the only word that comes...  Well...  Horrified.  This is why you got to get to Pal Talk.  They just saw the whole presentation with the naked guy interns.  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  And everything else.  Oh, wow.  That was a very nice presentation there, Pat.  It was awful.  Yeah, Pat, you wrote and choreographed and everything.  This is my brainchild.  Your responsibility.  Yes.  I say we make him do more intern skits.  Yes.  That's your new job, Pat.  Intern skits.  All right, then.  That's your new job.  When you have an intern skit ready to bring to the show, then the floor is yours.  All right.  I like that.  If it takes a day, if it takes a week, whatever. 
[02:11:30]  Whatever.  If I had more time, it would be a lot better.  Who knew a guy that had his face vomited into had such talent in putting together a production?  Yeah, just to remind people, Pat Duffy was the guy that was over the wastebasket when  Pat from Monocchi did his thing with the eggnog.  Just look at Baby Bird.  Baby Bird on break.com.  How long did this take for you to put together?  Bon Jovi told me what to do about 6.30, and I had it read by like 7.30.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  Very quick.  You started it today?  Yeah, this was all this morning. 
[02:12:00]  Great.  I'm disgusted.  It took them an hour to come up with this.  If you would have said 6.30, we would have finished by 6.32, I would have said that.  The worst part about it was I started writing them.  I had no help from anybody else, so this was...  We believe you.  Yeah.  All right.  Could the interns put their shirts back on, please?  Pyle got a nicer party in a full metal jacket.  Remember, Fat Boy, it's just a bad script.  By the way, I liked the haul.  That was very funny.  A little take on the thing we do. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Pat Duffy, everyone.  That was very good.  He's in charge of intern skits from now on.  Yes, he is.  Make sure he doesn't do any heavy lifting.  I just want that boy writing intern skits.  He doesn't have to get coffee or breakfast or anything.  I like that little...  That's his whole job now.  I like that little radio skit like that with the guy and the hole kind of bantering back  and forth.  I did get a little nervous, but I'm glad they stopped when they did.  Shut up.  It was perfect.  It was perfect.  Dude, I know this is beautiful.  I know this is a visual, but I'm barely listening to you because I happened to look at the  Pal Talk cameras, and the camera's on you now because it was on the action. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  You look like a little kid trying to broadcast.  Look at Anthony.  That's what he looks like.  He looks like a little boy.  There's way too much headroom, so it looks like you're really tiny in your chair on radio.  He looks good, though.  I mean, he's got his little...  His breasts are almost...  Oh, that's Lisa Ann.  Of course it is.  Don't mistake me for Lisa Ann.  Can we do line of the day and get the hell out of here?  I want to have some birthday cake.  I'm not stomping on this cake.  I'll have a snack.  No.  By the way, this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the opening. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, stepping back.  And thank you for all the birthday wishes on the fan sites.  It actually made me happy.  I read every single one of them.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  Every single one of them?  Just about, yeah.  You know, usually I bitch about the message boards, but it was really cool.  Yeah.  We got a couple runner-up lines of the day.  Apparently Brother Elmo's job now.  Oh, brother.  That boy needs a talking to.  Couldn't have been a funnier bit, though. 
[02:14:00]  Well, we can't talk about it, though.  Well, we can because it was just a quick thing that they do on message boards.  There's a thing to do on message boards where you read the post, and it kind of says,  this guy is being a real ass.  Right.  Let's say that's the topic.  Then you go to it, and it'll say whatever your name is on the message board is being  a total ass.  This guy, again, your name shows up.  And you're like, what the hell?  I didn't do anything to this guy.  But it's part of what you put in that in the actual line of text that no matter who's 
[02:14:30]  looking at it, it'll be their name that turns up.  Everyone who looks at it is an ass.  Thinks it's them.  Right, right.  So your brother apparently thought it was him.  Oh, boy.  He had no idea.  And it was 12 pages of people just railing him and goofing on him about how he missed  the joke.  He was didn't-get-the-bit guy.  Well, there were so many pages.  Did he ever jump back on and say, all right, you got me?  Yeah, and finally say, you got me, bravo, and took the joke like a man.  Well, because that's hard for us huses to admit that we actually got gotten.
