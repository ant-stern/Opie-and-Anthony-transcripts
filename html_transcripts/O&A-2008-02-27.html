<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recounting of their disastrous experience at a *Semi-Pro* movie screening in a dilapidated theater near the Port Authority Bus Terminal.  The audience was described as a mix of homeless individuals, criminals, and people with apparent mental health issues.  They encountered aggressive promotional staff dressed as Will Ferrell characters and had a conflict with security, involving their colleague Kenny.  The audience's behavior, including a man constantly rocking, added to their discomfort. Opie initially mistook the audience raising their hands for applause, only realizing later they were reaching for free promotional items. One host even fell asleep during the film.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of the upcoming presidential election, focusing on John McCain, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama.  They mocked a clip of Hillary Clinton from a debate.  They also discussed a listener planning to disrupt a debate with a racially offensive sign.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to Anthony's prom date contest, which included a sexually suggestive requirement.  Numerous calls ensued, including one from a woman offering to chaperone.  They also discussed an episode of *Moment of Truth*, focusing on a New York couple whose appearance on the show seemingly damaged their marriage.  A conflict with radio personality Maxwell (Benjamin Bornstein) and the potential renewal of his contract were discussed, along with plans to relaunch their “blimp” and collect bras.

The show continued with further discussion of *The Moment of Truth*, focusing on a clip of a woman revealing her infidelity to her husband, with Jim Norton as a guest.  The hosts and Norton expressed disgust and amusement, using vulgar language.  They then discussed the media's role in amplifying negative events, comparing the publication of a picture of a cancer-stricken John Gotti to their broadcasting of the *Moment of Truth* clip. This led to listener calls detailing voyeuristic experiences. The show concluded this segment with discussion of an animation contest and a brief tribute to Isaac Hayes.  Mark Wahlberg's alleged objections to the show's content and his decision to air it were repeatedly mentioned.

The next segment featured a listener's story about their landlord's son repeatedly peeping on them, including the discovery of a hidden camera.  The majority of the segment, however, centered on the ongoing feud with Benjamin Bornstein, using highly offensive and vulgar language to mock his appearance, weight, and perceived lack of talent.  They played audio clips of Bornstein, revealing his real name and criticizing his on-air persona.  The hosts referenced Bornstein’s website and female co-host, encouraging listeners to target his show.  They discussed the visual distractions caused by Pal Talk users and a future animation mocking Bornstein. The hosts repeatedly emphasized Bornstein’s perceived dishonesty and hypocrisy.

The show then delved further into the Bornstein feud, with listeners encouraged to harass him with suggestions including camping outside his station and holding offensive signs.  Several listener calls followed, with some joining in the attacks.  Jim Norton was mentioned, with a humorous description of his greeting.  A staged phone call to a credit card company about a rock star was performed.  An animation contest was again discussed, with instructions not to post entries online beforehand.

A segment involving several women from Ripe TV followed, with sexually suggestive comments and jokes about the women's physical attributes. The hosts threatened to play explicit videos on monitors behind them, causing discomfort.  The conversation evolved into a discussion of anal sex, with the hosts and guests debating the act's merits and techniques.  The show used highly offensive and vulgar language throughout.

The final segment featured seven women from "Ripe Seven," promoting themselves on RipeTV.com.  The hosts engaged them in a Q&A heavily focused on anal sex, causing visible discomfort and several women leaving early.  Graphic pornography was shown on screen, further disturbing the women. One woman fell while leaving.  The hosts found their reactions amusing. The segment concluded with most women leaving, leaving only one remaining.  The show also included a promotion for Anthony Cumia’s prom date contest and advertisements for SkiColoradoNow.com.  Highly offensive and vulgar language was used throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Two mentally retarded women strapped with remote control explosives  were used as unwitting suicide bombers.  Run! It is Pete Rose!  This is where the payment is going.  You're a drunken pig and you're not sexy.  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver that isn't you. 
[00:01:00]  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver letting you sober.  They are sick freaks!  What is the biggest piece of s*** you're involved with?  I think that's the way to go with this interview, I'm thinking.  This show.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday, right Anthony?  Yes, it is. 
[00:01:30]  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  You put a wow on your vehicle.  You drive around and the girl feels so inclined, she might just flash you.  That's right.  We're talking to some old friends in Cleveland.  Now that we're on live in Cleveland.  Yes.  And yes, Cleveland, we're still doing wow.  Yeah.  Like Anthony said, you get the wow sticker or homemade wow sign.  You throw it on your vehicle.  It supports the radio show.  And also you might see some boobies as you're going to your miserable job. 
[00:02:00]  Exactly.  I'm just glad that no one was injured yesterday.  Injured.  During the screening of Semi Pro.  Yeah.  You might remember we were leaving the show early yesterday because we went to see Will  Farrell's new movie Semi Pro.  Yeah.  Which was all right, by the way.  We had a screening.  Yeah.  But, you know, you might think a screening is us sitting in a room, maybe a couple other 
[00:02:30]  people, big comfy chairs and a couple of people smoking cigars looking going, yeah,  let's screen this.  That's exactly what we did when we saw the Walk Hard movie.  See?  It was in one of these executive screening rooms.  Yeah.  The chairs, like the regular movie chair, these were twice as big, twice as comfy.  They went all the way back.  They're almost like sleeper seats. 
[00:03:00]  That's what I was expecting yesterday.  And they had like fresh popcorn for everybody.  Here, here's your fresh popcorn.  A little drink.  Enjoy.  And there was maybe 25 people in the whole theater.  I'd like to see that one day.  So we, well, they just gave us the plug that we have to do today.  Let me read this, Anthony.  Watch Anthony start laughing.  Uh-huh.  Thank you to everyone for coming down to the Semi Pro screening yesterday.  If you missed it, be sure to check it out in theaters this Friday, Semi Pro starring Will 
[00:03:30]  Farrell, putting the funk into the dunk.  Mm-hmm.  And Will Farrell, I believe, is calling the radio show today.  Ooh.  Because I think he heard of our plight yesterday.  So instead of the special screening room that we just described to you guys and gals,  we get in a van yesterday after the show, and we start driving toward Times Square.  Yeah.  Uh, and Times Square, for the people that don't know, is a really lovely place nowadays.  It's like Disneyland.  It really is. 
[00:04:00]  They've really cleaned it up.  But the outskirts of Times Square, not so good.  Uh, yeah.  Not so good.  We pull up to this theater that is very, very close to the Port Authority.  You want to explain the Port Authority to the out-of-towners there, Anthony?  Oh, it's a wonderful place where you could catch a bus.  Mm-hmm.  Or a couple other forms of transportation.  Yeah.  And, uh, but mostly it's a place for the homeless to hang out and urinate.  The homeless, the pimps.  Criminals.  The drug addicts. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  We have a guy that works for this radio show from time to time.  He does security.  When he's not doing security for the Opie and Anthony show, his job is to catch jackers at  the Port Authority.  Yep.  And his job is to hang out in the restrooms at the Port Authority.  Some people just get lucky with their jobs.  They have to put in for that one.  You know the whole Larry Craig thing?  Yes, of course.  We know one of these guys.  He sits in a stall and waits for the, uh...  Waits for the foot tap.  Waits for the foot tap. 
[00:05:00]  That's how awful this place is.  And, oh, boy, the city of New York is now going to call us.  Like, oh, it's really not that bad.  And then we're trying to clean the side.  Every once in a while, I have to walk by the Port Authority.  I'm walking from, you know, downtown or whatever, and it's the easiest way back uptown to the  Upper West Side.  Every once in a while.  And you see the pimps waiting out front.  Yeah.  All these girls taking their little buses from, you know, their tiny little towns.  From the Midwest.  From nowhere, USA, right?  Mm-hmm.  Anyway, so we pull up to the theater, and I'm like, oh, this is really close to the 
[00:05:30]  Port Authority, and that is an asshole.  Could be the sleaziest area left in, like, the rebuilt New York.  Well, what's going on is Times Square is so awesome now, and it's so corporate and so  safe and so whatever.  It's kind of like almost, it's turning into, like, a mini Vegas almost.  Yeah.  Right?  A lot of neon.  But there used to be a lot of, like, sleaze in Times Square.  What happened was they're pushing those out to the, pushing it to the outside.  Yep.  And that's where the Port Authority is.  So we pull up to this theater, and the theater was a little scary. 
[00:06:00]  And then we go up about 10 stories to get to our freaking movie theater.  It took forever.  The longest escalators I've ever seen.  And all of a sudden, we start walking into the theater, and then we get accosted by guys  dressed up as Will Ferrell.  I don't understand what that was all about.  They were trying to do some kind of promotion.  Maybe it's going to be on a website.  I don't know.  But they're dressed in the ABA-type, you know, uniforms that they're wearing in the movie.  They're sitting in chairs, and then they wait, like, the second you come up the escalator, 
[00:06:30]  they just accost you.  Yeah.  They came running up.  Picture, picture, here.  Have a cup.  Yeah.  Have a plastic cup and a little cardboard cutout of a face of Will Ferrell on a stick.  Yeah.  What, am I supposed to hold this in front of my face?  I go, ooh, look.  People are going to mistake me for Will Ferrell.  And Kenny is just brutal.  Oh, yeah.  Doing his job.  He's great at his job.  They don't have time.  They don't have time.  He's, like, just being a complete ass.  They're part of this.  They're just, they're probably making, like, $5 an hour just to get a couple pictures of, 
[00:07:00]  like, you know, people going into the theater to see Sammy Pro.  And Kenny's just, like, he's acting like it's Michael Jackson coming through.  It's just, like, these guys don't have time for this.  I couldn't, I couldn't be bothered.  Right.  I was tired anyway.  Yeah.  And you know me.  Yeah.  I like getting out of the city.  Yes.  Pretty quickly.  But you did promise to go to the screening. 
[00:07:30]  But I promised to go to it.  And I was going to go because I assumed it was going to be, like, a screening room kind  of a thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But, yeah, first we're accosted by that.  And then the strict security.  Yeah.  At the door to the actual theater.  Yeah.  Because, I guess, they don't want people bootlegging.  So they were telling people to turn their phones off completely.  How about they don't want people shooting other people in the theater?  How about a metal detector?  I didn't know that yet. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, we're getting to that point.  Yeah.  How about a metal detector?  Who gives a crap if I'm bringing a cell phone into your theater?  So everybody is online, and the guy's going through, shut off your cell phone.  Well, it's on vibrate.  No, you need it off.  You need it off.  Turn it off.  So then he gets to Kenny, and the guy says, you got to turn your cell phone off.  And Kenny goes, no.  He goes, that's nice, but no.  No.  Mine stays on.  It's on vibrate.  Mine stays on. 
[00:08:30]  And he wouldn't shut it off.  He got into, like, a little altercation with the gentleman.  I thought it was going to get ugly.  Yeah.  Because he wasn't going to turn it off, and I guess the guy had been told, you know, make  sure people turn it off.  Then I was next in line, and he goes, is your cell phone off?  I go, I don't have one.  Meanwhile, I'm sitting there.  With the iPhone.  With the, yes, I got my little iPhone.  And a video camera, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  That was another thing.  Like, they're checking everybody.  Sam, little Sam couldn't get in immediately because he had a camera on him. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know, a photo camera.  Yeah.  And he had to leave it somewhere.  It's just a big pain in the ass.  Then meanwhile, I walk in, and I have a complete video camera in my pocket.  Oh, that little thing?  It's small, but this thing kicks ass.  Yeah.  And I could have filmed the entire movie on this thing.  Although, I saw the guy in the front row.  I saw the guy, too.  We'll explain that, too.  But so then we walk into the theater to take our seats for the great screening of Semi-Pro, 
[00:09:30]  you know, that they said them nice for us and our listeners, right?  I'm thinking that we are going to be taken care of.  And they have, what, two rows roped off for us, Anthony?  Yeah.  And I rip off the tape because here we are for our VIP seats, right?  I walk into the theater with Anthony, and as I walk in, I see everybody that's a little  higher up in the seat.  Yeah.  They all have their hands in the air.  Like they just don't care.  Right.  They all have their hands in the air, and stupid me, because I'm an idiot, I'm thinking,  wow, our fans are really excited to see us. 
[00:10:00]  I can't even look at you.  So I give a wave, like, what's up?  What's up, everyone?  Oh, boy.  I didn't say what's up, everyone, but I gave that look, like, hey, thanks for joining us  for the screening of Semi-Pro.  Very excited.  Oh, look how popular we are.  They all have their hands in the air, Jimmy.  Yeah.  And it took me a couple seconds to realize the reason they had their hands in the air  wasn't because the radio stars that are Opie and Anthony have just arrived. 
[00:10:30]  There was a guy right behind us throwing free Semi-Pro crap out.  Yeah.  So they had their hands up to receive free gifts, but they thought it was a king's welcome?  They were throwing things.  There is no idea.  I didn't even see that.  I was in the party, though.  I couldn't get into the seat quick enough and just sit there.  Well, I was, I was, I had to go on, like, the defensive. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Because I'm looking around.  Yeah.  Because the element in this place was just not good.  Well, remember when we were just talking about the Port Authority?  It was obvious that they walked around that area, which is awful, and said, hey, who wants  to see a free movie?  Yep.  So it was all, it was, it was pretty much the dregs of society.  Is it inside?  Right.  Is it inside?  And is it warm without just some popcorn? 
[00:11:30]  That's pretty much everybody that was in the theater.  We were kind of scared.  And thank God, um, Kenny was smart enough to tell the, uh, the company that, you know,  maybe I should, uh, you know, escort the, the boys to this, uh, screening.  Thank God, Kenny stepped up because it was definitely, it was definitely a little scary  in this theater for this screening.  And there were no, there were no fans of this radio show.  The stalker Patty was there and maybe one, maybe two more people, maybe.  And the theater was packed.  All the rest of it, they just doled the tickets out at the Port Authority and on the side streets 
[00:12:00]  and, uh, wherever they could find a bum sitting against a brick wall with a paper bag in his  hand with a bottle in it.  Yeah.  Where are the white people at?  Yeah.  And then some guy with some weird disease that was just like rock and roll in the entire  movie.  One of the only white guys had a severe problem.  Well, anytime.  I don't know what it was.  I was looking for his wheelchair.  He was, I think he was retarded.  You think?  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  Cause every time movie, uh, music started playing cause the movie is set in, you know,  the seventies.  Yeah.  So music would start playing and it's period music of the seventies.  Yeah.  He'd start like rocking back and forth to the music.  Yeah.  Complete retard.  He was just rocking in the seat, Jimmy.  So yeah.  So yeah.  Walked in thinking everyone, wow, they're finally here.  Hey.  And they're all just trying to grab free crap that is worthless.  I couldn't sit down fast enough and you never saw my head for the rest of the movie. 
[00:13:00]  I just slumped down into my chair.  I, I, I, I turned beat random.  Oh my God.  Oh, it was so bad.  And then to just see.  Oh, it was the worst.  It was the worst.  Smashing.  I can't remember smashing like that in a long time.  Than and, Than and Travis walk in with their plastic cups.  They're semi pro cups.  Yeah.  And, and little cardboard things.  I don't, you guys had stuff. 
[00:13:30]  Mm-hmm.  Than, what made you even hold onto that longer than a second?  We got roped into that picture.  Did you?  Wow.  How bad was that?  I felt bad for those guys because they were just trying to like, they were trying to be  like, you know, cheerleaders.  Oh, they were so like loud.  Get your picture.  Get your picture.  Come on.  Come on, everybody.  No.  And I, I was mortified and I know Kenny was doing his job, but I used to be that guy and 
[00:14:00]  I know how people treat you.  So I was trying to do the right thing.  Like, all right, hurry.  Come on.  Let's take a picture, but we got to get going, you know?  Anyway, the movie was all right, but, uh, can I tell you the audience was not, it was,  it was a scary audience.  And then that's when I was thinking, wait, they want us to turn off our cell phones, but  they didn't check any of these animals for freaking guns or weapons.  Where's the metal detector?  Dude.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Here's why I didn't want to go because this is what I knew was, it was not going to be  good when you had to be there by 11, a private screening or something that was for the show, 
[00:14:30]  they should have done for 1130 or noon.  Right.  When it said, look, it's starting at 11, it's like, this is a predetermined thing.  Yeah.  I would like you guys to be a part of it.  Whether you're there or not, that's starting at 11.  Yes.  Yeah.  Because they don't want the people rioting if it doesn't.  Anthony noticed the, uh, the neck gang tattoos as half.  Oh, that's all nice.  Yeah.  It's not half, but a bunch of, uh, people were coming and trying to find a seat.  I saw a lot of gang tats and then, uh, yeah, when the lights went out. 
[00:15:00]  Homeless.  Yep.  And white, uh, white guys that had some kind of mental problems.  Yeah.  Saw the guy with the, uh, little telescope thing.  He had a little infrared, uh, little scope.  Yeah.  And he was looking at the front of the theater the whole time at the seats, making sure nobody  was bootlegging the movie.  What did he have?  Like a night vision?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he could pick up, uh, any kind of.  Yeah, but he was light on the camera.  I was thinking about that though.  What a dummy. 
[00:15:30]  Because he only stayed on one side of the theater.  So I'm thinking if I'm Mr. Bootlegger dude, I'm going to like move my, my apparatus to  the left side of me and block it with a coat or something.  And I'm good to go because he had a little red light on the thing, which made everyone  go, what's going on at the front of the theater?  Yeah.  What does that guy got?  You know, that doesn't stop the bootleggers.  It makes them think of a new way to do it.  He should have kept moving from side to side is what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Checking out the whole theater.  I guess he didn't want to cross in front of people.  But, uh, yeah, that guy, I was looking and going, eh, I got a video camera on me. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  I could probably just tape it.  Yeah.  Although, you know, I wouldn't want to.  It's not like one of those movies that really, I wanted to bootleg.  Yeah.  And, um, anyway, you, you would have caught part of the movie.  Then, uh, the camera, if I was bootlegging it, would have tipped over while I was sleeping.  Yeah.  And then I would have come back up for the, for the end.  Oh, did you catch a few Z's?  Oh, boy, did Anthony.  I was a little tired.  Um, and I'm watching the movie. 
[00:16:30]  And then the next thing I know, I'm waking up and, uh, it's pretty much over.  The movie's over.  I was like, ooh, when did I fall asleep?  I guess it was well before this.  Well, I, I could call my girl and she'll tell me because I think you were sleeping on her shoulder at one point.  Oh, my God.  I kind of leaned over a little bit.  How tired were you?  I was leaning over a little bit.  Pretty much drooling on my chick.  I was sleepy.  That's why I go home.  I go home for a nappy. 
[00:17:00]  The sales guy for the station here in New York, he showed up and I could see it on his face.  He's like, oh, I, uh, well, I don't know what happened here.  Sorry, guys.  I, uh, wow.  You can leave if you want.  Chief, my kids were in that movie theater, too.  It should have been a private screening.  They should have maybe, I know, I know Andre came on yesterday.  It was very cool.  But I was so bothered that they didn't give us Will or, uh, or, uh, Woody Harrelson. 
[00:17:30]  I just, but yeah, yeah, it probably had nothing to do with them.  It was the people that rep them.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  It's coming in a lot.  Opie waves and got a big, not you.  There's nothing worse.  I can't, as you're telling me, I can't picture anything more horrendous than seeing the merch man behind you.  I'm just walking in, giving the big wave, like, hey!  Yeah, guys.  Well, they don't look like our-  Long time, no see.  We haven't been out in public in a while.  They really don't look like our listeners, but they're waving. 
[00:18:00]  I figured it out quick, but, uh, unfortunately, I did have the hand up, and I was, like, doing the big, hey!  That would have been good if one of the guys would have tossed something into your hand, just throwing a t-shirt at you or something.  And people just will get any crap if it's free, because there were people leaning over.  You know what?  Someone's giving away, like, bread out of a UN truck in a refugee line, and everybody gets together and their hands are all up.  That's what it looked like, only they were giving out this little 8x10 flimsy piece of cardboard with the movie logo on it. 
[00:18:30]  Like, what are you going to do with that?  One of those hit me in the leg from behind me, and my girl goes, uh, did they just throw stuff at us?  And I'm like, uh, no, no, no, I think they just didn't like it, and they were just throwing it, and then coincidentally it hit us.  Yeah, no, no, everything's okay.  Don't worry, don't turn around.  Where's Kenny?  Oh, God, I need Kenny.  Don't turn around, don't look.  Right, what's up there, Thad?  I got struck in the shoulder by something.  You did, right? 
[00:19:00]  I was like, it could be anybody.  And that says a lot right there, because I'm an ass.  But Thad could certainly defend himself, and if he's not turning around, if that doesn't give you a nice image of what we were, you know, dealing with yesterday.  You didn't even turn around at all, right?  And this thing hit you.  No, I'm going to get torn apart by zombies.  Yeah.  Just manhandled.  It was just an awful experience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Horrid.  This is one of the bigger radio shows in the country. 
[00:19:30]  Where you still get treated like crap.  How about a screening without people who go to the bathroom before they remove their clothes?  All right, if Woody Harrelson's not going to be there, give him a little talk beforehand.  Right.  You can accept that.  Yeah.  But how about no one who goes to the bathroom on themselves?  Yeah, we don't ask for much, right?  Oh.  And there were so many of those people that would absolutely go to the bathroom on themselves.  Of course they would.  That's what they were in the theater for.  It's like a giant portage on it.  Yeah.  It was, it was, yeah, they found a place to nap. 
[00:20:00]  And I must say, I don't remember seeing any, uh, corn dogs.  No corn dogs, uh, yeah.  What happened there?  Some kind of health department code?  I don't know.  Homeless guys probably ate them.  Oh, they probably did real quick.  Yeah.  I want another corn dog.  Could you give me a corn dog?  Who are you?  Who, who the hell are you?  Yeah.  Sit down up front.  Don't put your hand up like you know me.  You don't know me.  Just waving, waving to, just derelicts. 
[00:20:30]  Waving to bums.  Oh my God.  Oh, I felt so uncomfortable.  Wait, did you feel stupid when you were there?  Oh my God.  That is so bad.  Like, just ask me all day.  Wait, like the, like the tingle?  Oh yeah.  The scalp tingle?  Oh yeah.  What would, uh, what would future Opie do if he saw that Opie waving to a crowd of homeless  people?  Yeah, I wish I could go back, uh, in time now.  And just slap him in the face and go, don't be so stupid. 
[00:21:00]  Just take your seat, idiot.  That's what I would do.  Stop being desperate for attention and just sit down and enjoy the movie.  The old Opie would walk the new Opie and when the new Opie, the new Opie, Opie went  to turn on a wave.  You know how you guide a child by its shoulders?  Yeah.  The future Opie would just hold you by your shoulders.  Don't turn around.  And just, don't, don't sit.  Trust me on this.  See that?  See the merch man?  No, but I have to, no.  No, no, you don't trust me.  I'm from the future. 
[00:21:30]  Don't turn around.  I know how this ends.  They're not here for you.  It ends very embarrassingly.  They're not here for you.  And then Stalker Patty.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Oh, it was a good movie.  She took the escalator down right behind us.  And I'm serious.  It was about four or five stories up, this movie theater.  So these escalators just went on and on and on.  And she didn't stop talking from the top all the way to the street.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  I ran out of there.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Did she like the movie? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I thought it was very funny.  Usually I don't like sports movies.  It's a sports movie.  Oh, shut up.  It's not a sports movie.  It's a comedy.  Did you like it?  Were they laughing?  Yeah.  Yeah, there were some laughs.  Yeah.  Definitely.  How was Andre?  He was good.  Yeah.  He was the star of the movie, basically.  Well, one of the stars, sure.  All right, we're going to take a quick break here.  That's our experience at the semi-pro screening.  It certainly is.  I want to thank this fine radio station in New York City for putting us in harm's way yesterday. 
[00:22:30]  And then at one point, Roland comes walking in, and Opie starts gesturing, Roland, over  here, over here.  There's a seat next to Anthony.  And he goes in the aisle, and I look at him, and I go, sit there, and I'll kill you.  I will kill you.  I'm in no mood for anyone responsible for getting me into this position.  Leave.  I was getting some big laughs because just every once in a while, before the movie started,  I would just go, Earl!  Oh, yeah. 
[00:23:00]  There were about three or four versions of Earl there.  Easily.  That were like spitting images.  Yeah.  And I'm just yelling, Earl, what's up?  So you went to one on the 42nd Street and 9th Avenue.  Yeah, it was right.  Those are gang theaters.  Yeah.  One has one gang, and that's why there's one right across the street, because the other  gang goes there.  Oh.  That's why there's two more theaters.  Are you kidding me?  That's lovely.  A guy who works in a task force on 42nd Street told me that.  That that's why.  There's guys in blue that will go to one, and guys in red that will go to the other one. 
[00:23:30]  Ah.  Well, we saw...  That's nice.  I think we saw the guys in red, yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of tattoo teardrops.  Yeah.  So a lot of neck tattoos with initials.  I don't get scared often.  I was a bit scared yesterday.  I would never go to one of those.  I was a bit scared.  I'm going to be honest with everybody.  I was a little nervous.  But Kenny was just like, wow.  Very vigilant.  Intense.  He wouldn't even sit.  He wouldn't even look at the movie.  He was looking at us, watch the movie for two hours straight.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  I don't even know why we stayed, because we're good effing radio guys.  I would have left if I hadn't fallen asleep.  And I would have followed you out at that point.  That's gang theaters.  Oh, great.  Of course.  Thanks.  Of course.  Thanks for putting us in the gang theater.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Why else would they have one right across the street?  Doesn't it strike you as odd that there's one theater, and if you look out the window,  oh, there's the other one.  Yeah.  Why would they do that if not to separate the gangs?  And then they get mad if we trash the station or the company.  But come on. 
[00:24:30]  Do you understand what you're doing?  You put us in harm's way yesterday.  Hook us up for a dumb promotion.  The movie was good, but come on.  Do it right next time.  Find a white theater.  Hate to be like that, but we're in a white neighborhood.  And the street team, I noticed, they were acting like corrections officers.  More than a street team.  You know how street teams are, usually they get out there and they're all smiles.  They're all rah, rah, rah.  Yeah, yeah.  Throwing out shirts and stuff and giving things away.  These guys are like, all right, one.  Yeah.  Take it.  Yeah.  Here. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Lock down.  Move along.  Open three.  Right.  They were just like COs.  They earned their $3.50 an hour yesterday.  Oh, she certainly did.  Oh, boy, did they.  All right.  We got to take a break, bud.  Thank you.  Hey.  What's up, everybody?  Yeah.  What's up?  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Embarrassing.  Hey, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning to everybody. 
[00:25:30]  What's up, Cleveland?  What's up, Buffalo?  How are you?  I haven't talked to Buffalo in a while.  Hi.  They're just very quiet in Buffalo.  They enjoy the show.  Yeah.  They don't get too involved, but they just enjoy it.  Enjoy it.  They're very, very nice.  They would have been nice in that theater yesterday.  You know, after my theater experience, I'm thinking, this John McCain guy.  Man.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wow.  You changing your tune over there?  Loving McCain.  And his Popeye eye.  Hey. 
[00:26:00]  He was tortured.  He probably had his head in a vice.  I understand that.  He pop your eye out.  But I respect the fact that he's a war hero.  Yes.  No.  Absolutely.  I was in the gym.  Orchard.  And CNN was talking bad about McCain, but it was so tame, I can't even tell you.  I don't even remember exactly what, but they were taking a little shot at John McCain.  Yeah.  Nothing like what Obama and Hillary are doing.  And this guy just drops his weights and starts yelling at the TV, going, 
[00:26:30]  Come on, he's a war hero.  Leave him alone.  And I'm like, oh, God, please don't recognize me in the gym.  Don't recognize you.  You.  You're the one that really trashes him.  Yeah, he's, I don't know.  It's amazing that you can't completely figure out what's going to happen with these things.  Like, you should be, at this point, there are three viable candidates. 
[00:27:00]  You should be able to absolutely know who's going to be president.  No.  You should.  Not really.  With, going through history and looking at who's won the presidency before.  So you thought Clinton was going to be president before he was president?  That came out of nowhere.  People forget.  No one knew who Clinton was.  Once it was down to Clinton, you know, and who was he running against?  Bush?  Bush.  Yeah.  Bush Sr. was supposed to win that. 
[00:27:30]  He was extremely popular at the end of his first term.  Yeah, but his popularity took a dump before the election.  That was the worst time.  Yes, I understand that.  But he was, he should have had a second term.  He ran a bad campaign.  He lost it, rather than Clinton won it.  Yeah.  Clinton came out of nowhere.  People forget.  Like, it was almost like the Democrats threw Clinton, you know, in there, because they're  like, ah, well, Bush has got this.  He's got a second term wrapped up.  And then, wow, things drastically changed.  Maybe in other elections. 
[00:28:00]  But I remember, I remember going, who is this Clinton guy?  What is going on here?  This is Bush's win.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  It just seems to me like you should be able to go, oh, it's going to be a landslide.  So you're not feeling good about your boy there, McCain?  No, no, I am.  I kind of have a faith or a complete lack of faith in the people in this country.  I think they're still too scared.  Yeah.  I think people are still a little too scared. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, all right.  Vote for a woman or a minority as president.  They had a debate in Cleveland yesterday.  Yes, these two are just debating all the time.  I read someone's instant feedback, and he was very, very mad that we didn't take his phone  call yesterday because he was going to disrupt the debate yesterday in Cleveland.  And he wanted to get on the air because, and I had no idea until after the show, I was just  reading some feedback as we were like, you know, getting ready to go home. 
[00:29:00]  And his feedback says, man, I had something for you guys.  I was going to, you know, disrupt the debate.  And you guys didn't even put me on the air.  Oh, really?  And he goes, I had a sign that I was going to show in the middle of the debate.  Still going to do it, by the way.  Obviously, he didn't because there would be headline news around the world.  His sign said, I swear to you, the C word versus the N word. 
[00:29:30]  He wasn't going to do that.  No.  I swear to God, Jimmy.  I believe you.  It was on instant feedback, and the guy is so mad that we didn't take his phone call  yesterday on this fine radio show.  I'm like, what planet are you from?  How is that good for our show?  Yeah.  Because they will blame us in the end.  Yeah.  Thanks.  You think that sign would have actually gotten in?  I know.  Not after the.  What does that mean?  I bet you they're looking for signs left and right now, right? 
[00:30:00]  It's hysterical.  All right.  It would be.  Really funny to see.  Oh, my God.  Would that be hysterical?  Does that say the sign?  Who the?  What the?  There's no.  How the?  What?  The only thing we got.  You want to do a little Hillary and Obama?  I got one little thing.  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Because I love this phoniness.  I think it's Sam.  Hillary just very annoyed.  She's just annoyed in general.  She knows she's done.  She's been waiting her whole life to be president, and it's not going to happen. 
[00:30:30]  No.  Yeah.  And I think it's one.  I think she doesn't get another shot at this either, by the way.  No.  She's losing ground like crazy.  Maybe she could stop wearing her grandmotherly wool skirt-like jacket outfits.  Horrendous.  And I hate the way they just slap that red rouge on her appley cheeks.  Appley?  Oh, she's got these big friggin' appley cheeks.  Appley.  And they slap rouge all over it. 
[00:31:00]  Like grandma.  Appley?  Yeah.  You ever notice?  She's got those high cheekbone things, but that's usually an asset.  Are they implants?  I have no idea.  The women are getting the cheek implants.  Are they?  That's one of the things they like to get done.  Have the fat sucked out of her ankles and injected into her cheeks.  Yeah.  Well, it's a quick clip because we've got to get into the Anthony prom date thing. 
[00:31:30]  I did extra work yesterday.  Oh.  I'm getting very excited about this promotion we were attempting to do.  I wouldn't get too excited.  Let's do the Hillary first.  This is the only thing we got from last night.  The Houston Chronicle has called it a big win for Texas.  But Ohio Democratic Senator Brown, your colleagues in the Senate, has called it a job-killing trade agreement.  Senator Clinton, you've campaigned in South Texas.  You've campaigned here in Ohio.  Who's right? 
[00:32:00]  Well, can I just point out that in the last several debates, I seem to get the first question all the time.  And I don't mind.  You know, I'll be happy to field them, but I do find it curious.  And if anybody saw Saturday Night Live, you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow.  I just find it kind of curious that I keep getting the first question on all of these issues.  But I'm happy to answer it.  Why is she watching Saturday Night Live?  Yeah.  Exactly.  And Hillary, you might want to say that before the debate. 
[00:32:30]  You see, you don't want to complain about going first.  Right.  What do you want?  Last upsies?  Stupid.  This is not...  I think if you're making good points, it doesn't matter if you go first or second.  Are you allowed to call last upsies just before it starts?  I call last upsies.  Last upsies.  We were on the way over.  Senator Obama got in the front seat when I had specifically yelled shotgun in the lobby.  At which point she was tackled by Secret Service. 
[00:33:00]  The SNL thing she's talking about, we got that.  Oh, really?  Yeah, just a piece.  And our first question is for Senator Obama from Jorge Ramos.  Senator Obama, are you comfortable?  Is there anything we can get for you?  No.  Thank you.  I'm fine.  John King, a follow up.  Senator Obama, a minute ago, Jorge Ramos asked if there was anything we could get you. 
[00:33:30]  And you said, quote, no, thank you.  I'm fine.  My question is, are you sure?  Because it's, you know, it's really no trouble.  I am quite sure.  Thank you, though.  Wow.  Uncomfortable laughter from the audience.  Anyone else hear that?  I guess we're supposed to laugh here.  Hillary is a little upset because she's losing. 
[00:34:00]  That's what it is.  Yeah.  So she's going to bitch and complain.  She's thrown in the kitchen sink.  They're mentioning that a lot in these articles.  She's grabbing at straws, as they say.  All right, enough of that.  Who cares?  We got more important business here.  Are people saying she won or no?  Or he won, Brian?  They're saying their debates really aren't even getting a clear-cut winner anymore.  They're just these kind of niceties.  They're really not taking huge jabs at each other. 
[00:34:30]  I think they don't want to divide up the party.  So they're being kind of nice to each other.  They were comparing their records and saying that they were very similar on a lot of things.  It's a bunch of crap.  I don't really know who won.  Why did Obama have to denounce Farrakhan's support?  You know, it's like, why can't he accept the support of Farrakhan?  Because of people like Anthony?  You heard Anthony ranting two days ago?  Like, oh, that's the guy you want. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Farrakhan's supporting him.  Yeah.  You want a guy that Farrakhan supports?  Jimmy, you were sitting right here.  Anthony went off on that whole thing.  Like, oh, here's your boy, Obama.  There he is.  He liked it.  And I never used that word to describe him.  Boy.  I never said that.  But you don't want Farrakhan supporting your guy.  The guy's insane.  Yeah.  And so Obama's got to get out there and say, hey, I denounce this guy. 
[00:35:30]  I can't keep anybody from supporting me or liking me, he said.  But that's it.  Yeah.  Oh, look at her in the grandmotherly.  So some people are saying that the C won.  C wins.  I don't know.  You've got to give it to the N.  What?  Oh, my God.  N versus C.  All right, listen.  Let's.  What?  What?  What?  Need to fix?  Why?  I want to change the contact info on it. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, but we're ready to do this, Steve.  What are you going to do?  I'm going to change the contact info.  The contact info?  Like, people are actually going to, like, call in?  Yeah, do you think people are actually going to put the number?  Remember how we wanted to use the FU line as the number?  Yeah.  I want to put that in the form.  All right, why don't you stand close and then, like.  Tag it.  Yeah, you'll tag it and go, well, you know what you just heard?  Well, we've got to change something.  Because this is what we had planned for right now.  We're trying to get Anthony a prom date, and I did some extra work yesterday.  I don't see it working.  Well, let me play what Tim put together. 
[00:36:30]  Well, maybe this is a little more mainstream then.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I'm Anthony Cumia, and I approve this message.  Hey, it's Opie from the Opie and Anthony Show.  By now, you probably know that Anthony is single.  He broke up with his girl right around prom season.  I think Anthony wants to go to a prom.  Bring Anthony to your prom.  We're looking for women out there that would consider taking Anthony to their prom.  You can be Anthony's prom date.  Send a picture to us.  Where?  I don't know, because I don't have, like, someone's email in front of me. 
[00:37:00]  But I think voice guy will tell you where to send your picture.  That email address is promsearch at gmail.com.  I think Anthony wants to go to a prom.  Promsearch at gmail.com.  Send your photos and tell us why you want to be Anthony's prom date.  It's a prom date with Anthony.  And please, be 18 or older.  Thank you.  Over and out.  Gotta, gotta cut loose.  Put loose.  Put loose.  Jesus.  So, what has to be changed in that promo there, Steve?  Please call 866-FU-LINE-1 if you're interested in being Anthony's prom date. 
[00:37:30]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Isn't it if you're interested in Anthony being your prom date and not being Anthony's prom date?  Because it's not my prom.  You say potato.  I say potato.  And you don't feel good about this contest.  I'm not really feeling it.  I don't think anything's really going to come of it.  Huh?  I don't think anything's really going to come of it with some of the lewd descriptions of what is required of some of these young ladies. 
[00:38:00]  But we adjusted it a bit.  Really?  The only thing we can't budge on, we have to say it again, right, Jimmy?  I mean, if you're going to have Anthony as your prom date, you have to put out.  That's the only thing.  Everything else, we'll work around.  See, that seems to be the part that I don't think is going to work very well with him.  Jimmy suggests that you don't go to the prom, that you just stay in the parents' driveway as you're picking her up and do what you have to do.  All right, maybe you have to actually go to the prom for a dance or two. 
[00:38:30]  All right?  But the girl has to put out.  But see, that could be the problem when I come up to the house and mom and dad are there.  Yeah.  And they kind of know that the contest, one of the prerequisites there was that their daughter, how do you say, puts out.  Well.  You know, that might be a problem with the dad.  That has a lot.  Or mom.  What's the definition of putting out for a younger lady?  It might just be like, honk, honk. 
[00:39:00]  That might be the definition.  Do you even think copping a feel is something that the parents would be good with?  Well, I know the girls these days, they don't think, you know, is actual sex.  You know.  So that's a guarantee.  You're going to get some of that.  What's the problem, Anthony?  I don't know.  I don't think it'll.  Why don't you at least have an open mind and see if anybody actually calls the FU line and leaves their info. 
[00:39:30]  I mean, every time we mention this, the phones start lighting up.  Oh, yes, they do.  Unfortunately, it's a lot of guys.  A lot of guys are calling that they would never allow me in their house.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just don't think the description is very nice.  I could probably go and have a lovely time.  Well, what's the problem with this?  I think the deal breaker that you're saying is a little too rough. 
[00:40:00]  Now, how about this?  Not only do they have to put out, it has to be in one of three ways that you see fit, and you have to be older than the parents.  You have to be older than the parents.  Yeah, I think that's part of the rule.  They have to show ID proving they're younger than you by at least six weeks.  All right, I think that's fair.  By at least six weeks.  I think that's fair.  Yeah.  That would be a little awkward, I would say.  Girls 18, her parents are 20.  I mean, 38, 39-year-old parents, 40-year-old parents. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  We've got Lydia from Oceanside.  Hate her voice.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Lydia.  How are you?  I'm excellent, thank you.  How are you all?  Good.  What do you got today?  I wanted to let you know that when I'm not doing a private practice in the evening, I work in a school, and I often chaperone the prom, and I'd be more than happy to have Anthony come and chaperone with me.  I can't promise the girls will put out, but you never know.  Would you put out for Anthony?  Well, I'm married.  If I wasn't, I definitely would. 
[00:41:00]  Connection's bad.  It's fun.  No, it's perfect.  Connection's bad.  Hey, Lydia, how awful are you in the looks department?  Oh, I'm not awful at all.  I'm quite attractive.  Really?  You sound like you would be just horrendous, doesn't she?  I just picture her just a train wreck of a face.  You don't know.  Do we see a picture of you, Lydia?  Yeah, we need to see a picture of you. 
[00:41:30]  Okay, I can take a photo and send you guys a picture.  All right, send a picture.  Okay.  How are you going to do that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You tell me.  Are you part of my yuck?  No, I don't have a my face.  Yuck book.  Yeah, part of yuck book.  Right.  Sorry, I just said exactly what you did, Anne.  It's the older people's version.  She's on MyMenopause.com.  Crying woman with a profile.  Well, that part is true. 
[00:42:00]  Today's mood, hot flashes.  Feels fat.  He's fat.  You guys missed it.  She said that's actually true.  You're going through the menopause, Lydia?  No, I was just joking.  You were joking.  Guy.  I gotcha.  Let's go to Bill in Pennsylvania.  Bill, what's up?  Bill sounds like a guy's name.  Yeah.  Maybe it's Billy.  Billy.  With an I.  Billy.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hello, Bill. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, Amy.  Oh.  Hey, listen.  Sorry, Amy.  Better?  How about you just say what you wanted to say?  Jesus.  I just wanted to say hi.  I was feeling lonely and driving.  All right, we're going to take another break.  Click.  One more bad call.  We take the phones out of the mix today.  That's what we do.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  When we get back, anyone watching this moment of truth?  No.  A couple here in New York getting huge headlines because this woman went on moment of truth 
[00:43:00]  and pretty much ruined her marriage just to try to get the money.  Fessed up to some stuff.  It's amazing.  It's a lovely culture.  We got the audio.  We'll play it next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  But I'm to negative.  Stay there.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's going to be in Cleveland this weekend, folks.  Yes.  This Friday, the House of Blues.  Both shows are sold out. 
[00:43:30]  Of course they are.  But, you know, considering that the show is terrible in Cleveland, according to Benjamin  Bornstein.  I mean, Maxwell.  Sorry.  Sorry, Rockstar.  Sorry.  Benjamin Bornstein.  Sorry, Midget with the beer belly.  Yeah, a little short fat man.  I apologize.  I didn't mean to look at your non-Rockstar name.  Did Bubba make you pay?  Take Maxwell.  Okay.  I'll be there Friday night.  Not funny.  Not funny.  The guy's not funny.  Not funny.  He talks in his real voice. 
[00:44:00]  We got to communicate, too, that he spent a long time on the show again on us, and he  wants to punch us in the face now.  Oh, what happened, Benny?  I guess Maxwell wants to punch us in the face.  Does he?  Oh, boy.  Will Benjamin Bornstein or Maxwell be doing the punching?  Which one?  Jesus.  It would have to be Maxwell.  Oh, Maxwell because he's a tough guy?  This is what I'm going to do.  Shut up.  I'm in Cleveland every once in a while. 
[00:44:30]  The next time I go to Cleveland, which could be sooner than later.  Oh, what does that mean?  I'm going to have my entire schedule posted on the internet so Maxwell could find me and  try to punch me in the face.  You're doing stand-up?  I'm scared of semi-pro screenings.  I'm not scared of Maxwell.  Stupid Maxwell.  How about this?  There's a million Maxwells out there on radio.  Ooh, I'm going to punch you in the face.  Are you?  Well, I'm going to tell you where I'm going to be.  Hey, let's see it happen.  I'll leave your name at the door. 
[00:45:00]  Ooh.  Yes.  I'll leave two tickets under Bornstein and two under Maxwell.  You come as whoever you want to be that night.  Whatever douche you are for that day.  Whatever costume you want to put on, sweetie, you put it on and you can come to the show.  Nat Vanning.  Yeah, I'm just going to go and watch.  I mean, hey.  Yeah.  Is he going to go as Superman or Clark Kent?  Which one do you think, Jimmy?  You can go and just watch as the crowd sits there and just doesn't laugh at all.  Yeah.  Right? 
[00:45:30]  Because that's what happens at Jimmy's shows.  Yeah.  What a douche.  Go to Jimmy's show, brave man.  Go to Jimmy's show.  And punch him in the face.  And punch him in the face.  I like that, actually.  Who does he want to punch?  Did he say who exactly?  Is it all of us?  I don't know.  He hates me more than he hates you guys.  Oh, nice.  I'm guessing.  Just by the way.  He's spoken.  I got to communique.  So, I mean, we don't listen to his show.  We get communiques.  And then you force us to go freaking scan through a show to find what you're saying.  What if he shows up? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, I don't know.  Jimmy, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I don't watch him eat a lot more food than he should.  Who cares?  Punch him in the face.  I'm 39 years old.  You really want to beat people up for that?  So, why don't you just do this?  Use your real voice.  And be funny.  Just do that.  You know, I could do anything I want these days.  Yeah?  I should fly over to Cleveland.  Yeah.  And join Jimmy just in case Maxwell shows up.  And I'll have two people to punch.  I would like that a lot, actually, if you came.  Really?  And a mouthful of melon. 
[00:46:30]  I think you should go.  I could do whatever I want.  It's a little...  I'm a free man.  How do you fly there?  Continental still?  Yes.  We did Continental a few times.  I think JetBlue.  Does JetBlue go to Cleveland nowadays?  I don't know.  I'm not sure either.  They needed the money!  All right.  Well, maybe we should just stay home because we're scared.  Oh, yeah.  We're scared.  Petrified.  Not funny!  Not funny!  Benjamin!  Punch him, man!  Punch him, man!  And pan! 
[00:47:00]  I'm going to...  Next time I see them, I'm going to punch him in the face!  Are you?  And pan!  Are you really?  Go F yourself, little boy.  That's right.  You're a little...  What's the matter?  You're a little boy!  What's the matter?  The listener's getting to you a little bit?  What's the matter?  The listener's getting to you?  Let me tell you something.  Listen, I ain't heard one Benny Bornstein or Maxwell fan or anything call this program and  give us any crap.  And you want to know another piece of the puzzle? 
[00:47:30]  I was saving this one, Maxwell, but you might want to talk to your bosses.  You might want to talk to your bosses and ask them who they were trying to contact because  they heard that someone's contract might be coming up soon.  Let's see if they're honest with you, Maxwell.  That's your homework assignment today.  Go talk to your bosses and ask them, and let's see if they're honest with you. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Who they were trying to contact because their contracts are coming up soon.  Okay.  All right.  Benjamin.  There you go, Benjamin.  He's on 3-7 in Cleveland.  The number's 1-800-348-1007.  So maybe you're a fan of Maxwell and you want to call and tell me you're a fan.  Okay, fine.  Call and tell me you're a fan.  Have that little sit down with the bosses.  Let's see if they're going to be honest with you.  Hey, we're going to move on with our radio show.  We got a moment of truth.  This is a big story, especially here in New York because the couple was from New York. 
[00:48:30]  I think it's on page three of the papers today.  Young couple, they go on this moment of truth.  I try this moment of truth.  I try to watch it.  I was bored.  Yeah.  Especially when I found out that the questions they ask on this TV show, they ask ahead of time.  Yeah, beforehand.  There's no lie detector happening at that moment.  They already did the lie detector backstage as they ask these questions.  So as they're sitting in the hot seat, they already know what the questions are going to be asked.  And the answers and everything. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Right.  So I think everybody knew that.  And it made for a dull show.  So they needed something to spice it up.  And I guess this was it.  Right.  I wonder if this couple, by the way, this married couple that this happened to now, I wonder  if there's a contract thing that says you can't talk about it.  Maybe.  So they have to play along.  You never know.  So, you know, just a big blurred line now between everything.  What used to be reality shows and game shows, now you don't know what's what. 
[00:49:30]  There used to be like strict rules to game shows.  Yeah.  You couldn't do this or that or you get in trouble.  You can't do that anymore.  It's like, is it reality show?  Is it written?  Is it not?  Does it suck?  What am I saying?  Why am I telling you?  Yeah, I don't know.  Hold on.  We got to go backwards for a second.  Let's go to Tom Lindenhurst.  Tom, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Same, same.  You guys got to start the blimp back up, man.  Start collecting bras.  I think Maxwell's going to get a drive-by. 
[00:50:00]  You want to get the blimp going again, O?  Yeah, I say for old times, we fire up that blimp.  Liggy, linggy.  Beep, beep.  No, please don't linger that long.  Clear that area.  What do you say, Ant?  Do we fire up the blimp?  No lingering.  Let's start collecting bras.  You know, dude, I saw you in the camouflage.  Thanks, Rock Hall.  Thanks for trying.  Appreciate it.  Thanks for trying to help us out.  You're still a douche, though. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, so moment of truth.  It's a young married couple from New York City.  She's a hot blonde, and the guy is pretty much just a douchey little guy that just sat  there, according to Travis, and took this whole thing.  Yeah, a cop.  And we love the cops.  We really do.  But this guy, wow, not representing the NYPD.  Half the NYPD would have pretty much socked this girl in the face live on TV for doing  what she was doing.  This guy sat there and took it. 
[00:51:00]  I want to apologize to the NYPD.  You look bad today.  Was he in New York?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Jeez.  Here we go.  Moment of truth.  Once again, question 15.  Do you believe I'm the man you should be married to?  Oh, I guess this needs a set up.  Okay.  So the game's going along.  It's getting pretty intense, and they bring out this blonde's ex-boyfriend.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  And she's been married for a while now.  How many years?  I'm not really sure.  Not too long, because they're in their early to mid-20s. 
[00:51:30]  Okay.  Married two years.  So now it's time to bring out the ex-boyfriend and ask a question.  Once again, question 15.  Do you believe I'm the man you should be married to?  What's that question?  The ex-boyfriend.  As the husband is sitting there watching his wife. 
[00:52:00]  Well, I'm going to be honest and say yes.  Oh.  Oh.  Dang.  You've just been prone.  True.  How does this make you feel, Jimmy?  I see a look on your face of complete disgust. 
[00:52:30]  We're just a gross, disgusting society.  Yeah.  This is what we like.  Yeah.  We're just gross.  This is what we're...  More people are watching this than the debates.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is what we've boiled down to.  Yeah.  This is that thick mess at the bottom of the pot when you boil everything out.  Yeah.  That's what's left.  That's what's left of humanity.  We're a lovely culture.  We're a lovely culture.  But what guy would sit...  A TV show or not, what guy would sit there and let that happen in front of him? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Seriously.  And look at the dollar value.  She's just emasculating this man as the dollar value goes up.  She sold them out for 100 Gs on that question.  Yes.  What do you got, Travis?  And the crowd is clapping the entire time that she gets all these questions, right?  Yeah.  It's the new Rome.  But before this, she'd already been asked if she had cheated on her husband, which she  said yes.  Yeah.  And...  Well, actually, Travis, thanks. 
[00:53:30]  But that was the next question.  Oh, good one, Travis.  Good one, Travis.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  Thank you.  Sorry, we're going to send somebody over now to kill your little dog, Dexter.  Why would you do that?  Because...  Because payback is a bitch.  Yeah.  He's got to keep you in line.  That's right.  That's fair.  That's fair.  I'm going to punch your dog in the face next time I see him.  Oh, no.  Yes, I got it now.  I'm going to chew his ears off.  Yeah.  That little thing.  Big ears.  So, Jimmy, you're disgusted.  I'm just...  As much of a perv and a creep as I am, this voyeurism is just depressing. 
[00:54:00]  It's just the fact that this is what people...  Like, just this game show host, this failed entertainer is to stand there.  And ask...  Emasculate some NYPD cop.  It's just annoying.  Yeah.  Just blindsided.  The cop's dumb for sitting there instead of just getting up and knocking her teeth out.  But just what an awful country, man.  You know, I don't believe in hitting women.  But in this case, I'm thinking...  I agree with Jimmy.  The guy should have got up and slugged her. 
[00:54:30]  What else could you do?  Look at this stupid...  Well, that's the guy...  I think the host is the guy from Temptation Island, right?  Is he the old host from Temptation Island?  Yeah.  He used to be the host on Temptation Island where he was hoping the couples would cheat  with other couples on the island.  That'd be great.  That is true.  You just stand up and whack her.  Blacken that eye.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  Here we go.  So I think this is the next question.  Oh, here's the husband responding.  What do you think the husband's going to do?  He just...  Here's...  He obviously hates the ex-boyfriend to begin with because he's not stupid.  The ex-boyfriend comes out and they ask the girl, would you have married the ex-boyfriend?  She says yes.  Now you're the husband.  What are you going to say on this show?  I really don't know.  I didn't see this show.  Unless you were cuckold and you like this, what can you say?  Yeah.  All right.  Gee, that's kind of... 
[00:55:30]  I thought about you.  A semi-pro?  They had a little cuckold scene.  Yeah.  They really...  A little cuckolding?  Yeah.  A little bit.  Nice.  I wasn't getting a massage while you guys saw that movie either.  You weren't?  No.  No, sir.  What are you talking about?  You want to elaborate?  No, sir.  Okay.  Here we go.  Husband responding.  Is there anything you want to say at this point?  There's really nothing else I can really hear.  So, you might as well just go for it. 
[00:56:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Have you guys talked about this ex-boyfriend at all?  Yeah, earlier on in our marriage.  But, I mean, I didn't know he was still an issue.  I mean, with an answer like that, I can only assume that you're not happy.  Are you unhappy?  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Oh.  And look at that.  I like the way that people are trying to pretend that they're not the pigs that they are.  They go, oh.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  They're there.  What are they going to ask next? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, I can't wait.  Oh.  Hopefully, they ask her how many times she gave up the third hole.  They're just, yeah, you're right.  They're just lapping it all up as audience members.  At least in ancient Rome, they were honest.  Like, when you were buried up to the neck, they wouldn't pretend.  They wouldn't feign empathy.  They would just go screw at your skull.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's a rotten tomato against your side of your face.  Well, I don't want to explain yet.  This ends perfectly, by the way.  But here's the next question. 
[00:57:00]  Since you've been married, have you ever had sexual relations with someone other than your husband?  Oh.  I'm going to have to say yes.  Oh.  That answer is true. 
[00:57:30]  Why are they clapping?  Who's clapping at that?  The whole audience is clapping.  Yeah.  This is still a game show, everybody.  Come on.  Yeah.  Clap.  They're clapping.  The music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The music.  And the guy is sitting there just taking it.  I don't know.  How desperate are you for fame?  Oh.  Bad.  Bad news for the country. 
[00:58:00]  You just see, like, why we're hated around the world.  That's who we are.  Yeah.  This is us.  This is our, uh...  Oh, God.  You know, and if it was a good show, I would be right there watching it.  It's just an awful show.  Yeah, it's not even entertaining.  It really is.  I'm not going to sit here and be Mr. Innocent here.  I would watch something like this, no problem.  But they try to do it in such a way that it's kind of safe, and they don't actually have the lie detector hooked up to the person. 
[00:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  And it's all predetermined and all that crap.  There's a new show about infidelity.  It's called Smell My Finger.  Tuesdays on Fox.  Five of the wife's friends come in, and she has to be blindfolded to guess which one the husband was out with.  The only problem I have with this show, or this particular show we're listening to, is that the guy, the husband, is just sitting there taking this.  Yeah.  I mean...  You're not a man.  Act.  You can act like a man. 
[00:59:00]  You're not a man.  Unbelievable.  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore.  Two more gets you $200,000.  But, be careful.  One mistake, you lose it all.  Are you feeling like you should go for it now?  Yes.  Okay.  Now, before we play the rest of this clip, what's key to this story is the fact that the woman, after she was on this show, was interviewed, and she said that... 
[00:59:30]  She said, what the hell?  You know, I'm doing this for the money.  Really?  This is a nice payday.  I'm doing this for the money, so I'm willing to say, you know, to expose who I am as a person, so I could walk away with a boatload of cash.  That's got to be nice for the husband when he goes into the station house.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, did you see the TV show?  He was probably telling everybody, hey, I'm going to be on TV. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, great.  Do you think they watched?  Walks in there.  Oh, how embarrassing.  The L.A. cops with Rodney King were happier about their TV appearance.  Question 17.  Do you think you're a good person?  Jimmy, you all right?  What happened?  Just a really good question.  It's a good follow-up.  It's wonderful, right? 
[01:00:30]  You're just wrong to steal cookies.  What?  Honestly, I think I am a good person.  So your answer is?  Yes.  This crowd should be gassed.  That answer is?  Phones. 
[01:01:00]  She loses all the money on that question.  Let's say hi to Mike in Philly.  Mike, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Oh, if you were just saying how the guy just sits there and takes it, and you would never  be able to do that.  At the end of the clip, he goes up and hugs her and kind of consoles her.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  Consoles her?  Wouldn't you just...  Wouldn't you at the very least just walk out? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  At the very least, this is going on in your relationship.  Wouldn't you just walk out?  Absolutely.  Why would you sit there?  There's nothing in the rules that say that the guy has to sit there and take it.  Oh, here's the clip.  Look.  They all applaud at the end.  And they're hugging.  And this is the last clip of the show.  Lauren, I am so, so sorry.  Why do you think this came up as a lie for you when I ask you, do you think you're a good 
[01:02:00]  person?  Because even after everything I have done, stealing the money and everything, I think  that I've become a better person.  That's why I think I am a good person.  Oh, so you're a piece of crap.  Yeah, it came up as a lie, which means that somewhere in you, you haven't forgiven yourself.  It's an old boyfriend.  Somewhere, your truth is that you don't think you're a good person at all.  Why don't you go out and hang out with your family?  And I thank you very much, Lauren, for being on the show.  This host, Mark Wahlberg, is the worst smarmy ass. 
[01:02:30]  You guys have been around, just kicking around forever.  His arm should be ripped off in some sort of a farming accident.  Let's get him on the show.  In a combine.  With that stupid suit, just dangling.  Give me an interview with Mark Wahlberg.  And not the good one.  Not Dirk.  Not Dirk, right.  This clown.  Let's get him on the show.  You know what?  But we're a pretty honest show. 
[01:03:00]  Sure.  I believe we're more honest than any other radio show out there.  We're not perfect.  We understand that.  Curtis Nunn writes from Atlanta.  Yes, this game show is so despicable.  Why are you playing the audio?  Oh, well.  Because we're bigger pigs than they are, sir.  Exactly.  Call this out, and we'll acknowledge you have a fine instant feedback there, sir.  There's no illusions with this program, sir.  No.  We're not trying to pawn ourselves off as some help show or, you know, we know we're scum. 
[01:03:30]  That show should put a we're scum disclaimer in front of it.  Yeah.  By the way, some people might laugh because I was Spuds Buckley back in the day.  Well, this Mark Wahlberg used to be a singing waiter.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  And that instant feedback reminds me of something that's going on in the New York paper as well today.  There is on page three of the Daily News.  They got a picture of John Gotti.  Oh, I know.  Oof.  And the family very, very pissed off that this picture was released onto a website, I guess. 
[01:04:00]  Cancer ravaged John Gotti picture in the paper today.  What I find really interesting is the headline.  It says, family's furious as dying Gotti pic hits the net as the paper showing the picture.  Yeah.  And I would say to the Daily News today that I didn't even know this picture was on the  internet, but I now know because you printed it in your dumb paper. 
[01:04:30]  You put the picture in the paper for more people to see than ever would have seen on the  website.  Exactly.  And you're pretty much trashing the website for having the picture on their website.  Mm-hmm.  But you're showing the picture in the paper as you attempt to trash the website for having  the picture up there.  We're just insane.  The media is insane.  The same thing we just did.  Oh, I know.  That's why I went this direction now, Jimmy. 
[01:05:00]  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  It's like the whole Janet Jackson thing again, the whole Imus thing.  More people heard about Imus and saw the Janet Jackson thing because the mainstream media  shoved it down our faces a million times after the incident.  If they would have just kind of let it go away, eh, not many people would have.  I would have seen the Janet Jackson booby in the end.  Yeah.  You know?  And speaking of which, if you want to stop school shootings, here's a message to the media. 
[01:05:30]  Don't cover them.  And it's going to go away.  Oh, they can't.  Don't cover them.  Tell a tiger not to eat.  You know, the last school shooting, we didn't even talk about it.  We just, because we decided a while ago, let us, you know, for the most part, we're not  going to cover it.  Yeah.  You stop school shootings by, by stop covering it.  Because they see a lot of publicity.  I think it's to the point where there's other dopes out there that are going to do the exact  same thing.  These lonely guys.  These lonely guys that would have just walked in the woods somewhere and put a gun to their 
[01:06:00]  head and now are going, ah, wow, look at this.  You're putting ideas in their head.  How about this?  The next time there's a school shooting, we'll only cover it with a song parody contest.  Yeah, listen to this.  The last photo of cancer-stricken mob boss John Gotti depicts a not-so-dapper Don, and  its release left his spouse a less-than-merry widow.  This is what the Daily News is saying, basically trashing the internet, as they show the picture.  The picture's right there for you to see. 
[01:06:30]  There you go.  Yeah, that's a brave sight there.  Putting that up.  No kidding.  John Gotti was a great man.  Yikes.  I hate the comparison.  They put the two pictures together with the dapper Don, and he's all dressed up in his  friggin' expensive suits.  And his dappery.  His dapper, yes.  His dappery.  Yeah, his dappery.  And then they put that picture up next to it.  It's like, oh, oof. 
[01:07:00]  In prison.  Yeah.  He really is the movie-type godfather Don, you know?  Had that whole thing, and then just dying in prison like that.  Right.  Let's say hi to Mark in Philly.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you down?  Hey, good.  What I think, from the moment of truth, the very worst part of that show was probably about  five or six times, every time they came back to break, Mark Wahlberg, that scumbag, sat  up there and said, oh, we shouldn't show this show.  I don't think that the network should have shown the show, but they decided to show it. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, God.  The network decided to show it.  That's a bunch of horse crap, man.  I mean, you know, when we got a piece of, like, gold in front of us, we know how valuable  that is.  Yeah.  Run with it.  But you're going to have a moral-like angle to it as well.  He knows how unbelievable that show was and that everyone was going to talk about it  today.  Stop being a phony.  Get him on our show. 
[01:08:00]  Let's see how brave Mark Wahlberg is.  You going to punch him in the face?  He's a BSR, man.  That's what's symptomatic.  It's like everybody loves this stuff and likes the voyeurism and likes the negativity,  but everybody pretends they don't.  Like, we're all just, that's what Americans do.  We just deny what creeps we are.  Yeah.  See, that's why I don't think we'll ever, you know, be on TV like this, because as the  host, I would be sitting there going, isn't this awesome?  She's a whore.  This guy's sitting here taking it. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't be able to help myself.  And he's thinking the same thing, but he's playing the Hollywood part.  I'd be like, wow, you're a slut.  All right.  Next question.  I love when they look concerned about the people.  It's like, stop it.  Let's go to Tammy in Maine.  What's up?  Hi.  I just wanted to let you know that prior to that being aired, Mark Wahlberg came on and  said that he strongly objected to that even being aired.  However, they forced him to do it. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  Then leave the show.  Exactly.  Right.  Don't do the show.  Yeah.  Then quit.  He wants fame so bad, he would do that with a cancer patient that's dying.  That's right.  He would get a cancer kid up there dying and have mommy admit all sorts of horrific things.  Yeah.  You have to get the audience guesses where the lump is.  Right.  Oh, God.  If I saw that girl walking down the street, I'd punch her in the face myself.  Yeah.  She's no good, man.  Thank you, Tammy.  I agree.  All right.  You're welcome.  And Adam in Jersey. 
[01:09:30]  Adam?  Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you guys for mentioning the Gotti story because I actually didn't  hear anything about it.  So now that you mention it, I can go get the paper.  Oh, jeez.  And you know what?  Hey, we never said a word, okay?  You know what?  And Adam is 100% right.  We did exactly what the media does, but at least we admit it.  At least we admit it.  So as long as we admit that we're scum, that's okay.  Well, the other news organizations would blame somebody else and go, oh, look.  Yeah.  Look what Imus did. 
[01:10:00]  Look what he did.  Yeah.  And then play the clip over and over again, and now you're turning this horrific clip on  to tons of, you know, millions of people that never heard the broadcast.  I want to make sure we offend way more people than Imus did that day.  Yeah.  Can we do that?  Imus has a small audience compared to what these network news programs have.  Yeah.  So they're actually the ones that are offending way more people in the end than the original  broadcast.  Always do a lot more damage than the original event, whatever it is. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Sir.  A lot of people say that show is so fake, the moment of truth.  It might be.  Yeah, that's what I was saying before.  You can't tell anymore.  It's so ridiculous.  Maybe you got couples that are going to break up anyway or something.  Is it a reality show or a game show?  A game show?  It's a game show.  Well, then, aren't there rules to how you give money away on a game show?  I'm not sure if it's, you know, 1955 anymore. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Where, uh, you get in trouble for, uh, setting up game shows.  But it doesn't seem to me like, uh, it's, is it a reality show, which I think you can give  money away because the people are being compensated for their involvement or a game show where  they actually have to do something to win a prize and follow certain rules.  It was very, uh, you know, it was, it was a very definite line there years ago.  Can we get the written rules for that show?  Is there a way the public has access to that or no? 
[01:11:30]  Do they have a disclaimer at the end that flies by at 8 billion miles an hour?  I don't know.  That if you freeze frame it, you could see that, you know, contestants have been paid and they know in advance.  Blah, blah, blah.  Let's get our boy on the, on the show today.  Richard Huff.  He'd probably have some, uh,  I might have some, uh, info.  Did Richard Huff has anything on moment of truth?  We know a couple of guys at the papers.  Papers.  She had sex with the ex-boyfriend.  They'd love a story like that.  Love a story like that.  Dirty ex-boyfriend.  His broken jaw. 
[01:12:00]  Talking between your teeth.  Going out for Italian food with a broken jaw.  Can't eat anything.  Oh God, that hero looks great.  Jesus Christ, I can't eat anything.  One piece of spaghetti and I'll suck it through my teeth.  How's Italian food?  Here, shut up, McCluskey.  Yeah, just eat.  The worst question you could possibly ask.  It's great with the, the lead sauce you're going to have.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, I want to see a new game show.  Uh.  Are you sluttier than my whore wife?  Wow. 
[01:12:30]  I think they're working on it for Fox.  Uh.  It'll be part of the new Sunday night lineup, I believe.  Ready for a break?  Sure.  We got a nice peeping, uh, Tom story.  And then Danny, uh, Danny has a story about, uh,  somebody peeping on him and his, I think his ex-girl.  Yeah.  As they were trying to have sex or something.  So.  You know what?  You know what?  We blew the whole voyeuristic thing yesterday because, uh,  we had guys going,  hey, uh, when I was, when I was in college, I was in a fraternity.  I watched, like, sorority girls shower. 
[01:13:00]  Remember yesterday?  We were thinking that would have been a great, like, little break.  Uh-huh.  A voyeuristic break we do every once in a while?  Yeah.  We got to get the women to call up.  The women that know they're changing and showering in eyesight of somebody.  Mm-hmm.  That's how you do the bit.  Get the hot-sounding girls on the phone talking about their boobies and stuff  and lathering up.  There's always, uh, a lot more of the other end of what we want to hear.  I understand.  It's some guy, hey, doesn't even know how to make it hot. 
[01:13:30]  No.  Stand, morning, breakfast, nude, window.  Right.  All right.  Thanks for the call.  We need the girls.  And he throws in the S-bomb or something, so we have to dump out of it anyway.  We need the girls, kind of like the pictures we might have saw yesterday,  of the girls that are aware that they're doing just that,  changing in front of open windows and stuff.  Never happens.  We go through a cornucopia of awful callers on a daily basis. 
[01:14:00]  We'll see.  Just horrid.  We'll see.  We'll find out next.  Steve is calling Richard Hoff.  Okay, we got lots of show to do.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities today.  It's Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  Jimmy's going to be in Cleveland.  I am.  And we have a, uh, make sure Erin doesn't go anywhere from Boston.  We want to talk to her.  We got a fine story from Cleveland.  One of those, uh, feel-good animal stories we like to do every once in a while on this show. 
[01:14:30]  What's the scoop?  Well.  Sorry, I just had a piece of melon in my mouth.  Uh, humane agent Sarah Westman's cell phone rang at 10 p.m. on January 10th.  Hmm.  This is, uh, out of the Cleveland area, right?  Uh, the Animal Protective League near, uh, blah, blah, had taken four starving and ill  horses into protective custody from a boarding stable where five other horses were found dead, which is very tragic. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, I kind of remember this story.  Yeah.  But they, uh, they rescued four.  Uh-huh.  Found five others that were dead.  A foster home had been found for two.  Mm-hmm.  Rescue Village immediately agreed to take the other two into our barn.  Happy Trails Animal Sanctuary, a wonderful group, which we had helped out weeks earlier,  offered their trailer to bring the horses up to Rescue Village. 
[01:15:30]  Hmm.  At midnight, the horses arrived.  All right.  Help is on the way.  Nice.  There's Opie, a 20-plus-year-old stallion, and Anthony, a 10-or-so-year-old gelding.  Oh, damn.  You're a gelding.  Want to be the gelding?  These horses that were rescued, yes, were named Opie and Anthony.  A fan of the show.  Apparently.  A little coincidence.  So, Opie, a 20-plus-year-old stallion, and Anthony, a 10-or-so-year-old gelding. 
[01:16:00]  Damn.  We're seen quickly by Dr. Megan Hora.  Mm-hmm.  Both horses were severely malnourished and neglected.  And we learned that Opie had only a small chance of survival.  Oh.  And the ass on the horse actually waved to a bunch of people who had their hands up for merchandise.  All right, Jimmy.  I was very uncomfortable. 
[01:16:30]  Why do you keep bringing it up?  I really thought they were waving at me.  You heard.  Calls for donations of funds and feed went out through the grapevines of compassion.  By Friday afternoon, a wonderful vet, Dr. Pamela Hess, joined the medical care team.  Saturday morning, a truckload of donated hay arrived for Opie and Anthony.  That's nice.  Tragically, Opie passed away on Sunday.  Opie!  Oh, no. 
[01:17:00]  In his stall at Rescue Village, unable to overcome the devastating effects of starvation and neglect.  Wow.  For Anthony, the outcome of this rescue is not yet written.  But for now, his health is improving.  Where was Anthony?  They starved.  There was some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show and named his horses after us.  And then let him starve.  And then let him starve.  Great.  Thanks, jackass. 
[01:17:30]  Kind of like what we're doing to the listeners.  Starving them slowly.  Starving them of entertainment.  Of entertainment value.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, that's terrible.  I like horses.  I love horses.  Let's say hi to Erin.  She used to ride my little horse.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And I just put my little saddle on him and the bridle and ride him around.  And it's very sad that horses that had our namesakes are in such bad shape. 
[01:18:00]  All the best to Anthony.  I hope he does very well.  Well, we'll be keeping track of Anthony.  Is there anywhere I could help and donate?  And we'll also be keeping track of this horse.  I'd donate to Anthony.  Stupid horses on Pal Talk all night.  Freaking mash liquor.  Funny, Opie, that you and the horse were the same age. 
[01:18:30]  Well, Bill from Waterford, I'm a little older.  It's just slightly older than the horse.  Oh, right.  Hey, let's say hi to Erin.  She's listening on BCN up there in Boston.  What's up, Erin?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Okay.  So I was going to tell you a story about some changing in front of a window.  Nice.  This is what we need.  This is what this show needs.  It wasn't me, though, but it's a really funny story.  My friend Janet, who was my roommate, we lived in Newton Center in this two-floor condo,  and she's wicked, wicked hot. 
[01:19:00]  What do you mean by wicked, wicked hot?  Just like...  She's from Boston.  Columbia.  No, I like the wicked.  I always enjoyed the wicked thing.  But, I mean, you've got to explain why she's wicked, wicked hot.  But she's just a really cute girl and had a really hot body, does have a hot body.  And she would...  She's just not a Rhodes Scholar put it that way, though.  She would come home at night and have the same routine, take a shower and change in front  of this window that faced a temple, like a Jewish temple in our neighborhood. 
[01:19:30]  And at night, there would be nobody there, so she wouldn't think of anything.  So, one night, she's upstairs, I'm downstairs, and I hear...  I hope I can say this on the air.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I hope I can say this on the air.  I like that.  99 out of 100 times, you can't say that.  It means no.  It means no.  I hope I can say this on the air.  I do believe Erin from Boston doesn't study the FCC regulations like Anthony and I do on  a regular basis.  I don't think she's going through the stacks and stacks of documents. 
[01:20:00]  And so, I'm going to assume that...  You know what?  How about we just let her say it, and it'll be very obvious if you can say it on the radio.  Because if you can't say it on the radio, you're going to hear the whole show jump forward.  Yeah.  I hope I can say this on the radio.  I saw her...  And her...  Is that okay?  Yeah.  I saw a big...  Go into...  And she...  It.  And then a guy came over and...  Her... 
[01:20:30]  And...  It all over the curtains.  Just all over the curtains?  Isn't it usually on her?  It...  Oh, well, yeah.  Well, he...  Up after...  On the curtains.  Ah.  But before that...  Oh, God.  He...  Her in the...  And the...  And her...  And the...  And on her...  And through the...  And she took...  And just...  And...  Of it. 
[01:21:00]  It's not that bad.  Anyway, Arden, go ahead.  Oh, no.  Damn it.  Okay.  It was wicked hot.  And she screams downstairs.  Arden!  Arden!  Checking off!  All right.  Well...  Hey!  Woo!  We got a winner.  Check, please.  We got a winner.  All right.  Arden, I would have to say no.  That will not make it on the air.  Yeah.  Your lovely, wicked, wicked hot roommate is doing her thing, and there's a guy doing something 
[01:21:30]  as well.  Taking care of business...  Yeah.  That's...  Solo.  Yeah.  While watching it.  Wait to even try.  I like when they repeat it again, like she would say that, and then you go, no, no,  taking care of business by himself in a solo thing.  Yeah.  Yeah!  F*** off!  What?  No.  What?  Just follow our lead.  We've been doing this a while.  So that's...  But that made you guys laugh, probably, right?  Well, not yet.  I didn't know what she was talking about, but I run up the stairs, and I'm like, looking 
[01:22:00]  around, like, oh!  And then she points out to our driveway, and there's a dude standing in our driveway with  his pants around his ankles.  And...  Wow.  And...  Taking care of himself.  This is the middle of winter.  So...  Just standing in the driveway?  Standing in the driveway in the middle of winter?  What the...  Yeah.  Jaws around his ankles, so then...  Wow.  He starts to run away, and he's pulling his pants up. 
[01:22:30]  Doing the shuffle.  Shooka, shooka, shooka.  Wow.  You hear that belt scraping the pavement, the little metal belt pocket, all clink, clink.  He's trying to yell that it's cold.  That's why it looks like this.  Yeah.  All right, very good story, Aaron.  I haven't done yet.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Excuse me.  Happened.  Didn't know we were listening to the Aaron radio show.  What the hell happened next?  The story seems to be over.  It's like a movie with a twist.  Yeah.  Is this after the credits?  We should have sat...  Yeah, we should have waited.  Well, you told me. 
[01:23:00]  You'll probably hang up on me in a minute, but...  Probably.  He ran away, and then I run downstairs to lock the door, and he came back and dropped  his pants again.  So I call the police, and he's standing out there, and they come, and Janet is trying  very not delicately to explain to them what's going on while the cop is, like, turning beet  red.  And she tells him this.  And he goes, can you describe this guy for us?  And she goes, well, he was doing it really slowly. 
[01:23:30]  Like, he wasn't in a big hurry.  Oh, she was watching...  Well, why wouldn't you be in a big hurry?  Sure.  I want to take it all in.  Why is the cop embarrassed?  Boston cops love stories like this.  Yeah, they don't care.  They don't care.  Right.  I know.  He's probably...  Sorry he missed out.  So the best part of the story...  Oh, my...  The best part.  The best part of the story would be a click of a phone.  And a dial tone.  And a dial tone.  I told you I would eventually hit you after all these years of listening to the show, but 
[01:24:00]  no.  Don't hate me.  It's all in fun.  Sort of.  It was the best part, Erin.  Yeah.  Okay.  Maybe not the best, but I emailed immediately all of my friends to tell them what happened.  And every guy friend I knew who knew Janet writes back and admits that it was them.  Like, they've been waiting years to...  Oh, see that...  Jesus.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, I get it.  Can I interject with a brief correction?  Yes.  Not only was that not the best part, it was a complete waste of everybody's time and energy. 
[01:24:30]  It could be the worst part.  Erin, thank you so much.  How horrible.  Thank you so much.  You're nice, Anthony.  Bye, guys.  What?  Whatever names you want to fire at me.  I don't know.  Whatever you do.  At least you're nice.  All of you.  Let's go to Jackie in New York.  Jackie.  Hi.  This is day two in Voyeur Stories, and we're failing again, I think.  What's up, Jackie?  Hi, guys. 
[01:25:00]  Hey.  Hi.  Mine's kind of similar to Erin's, but not really.  We studied abroad for our junior year in college in London, and we were all American students.  And we get over there, and my flatmate or roommate wound up being from New York as well.  So we really hit it off, and we both like to go out and party, like, every single night, and the other three girls are, you know, pretty, you know, into their studying and doing well, and we just wanted to experience London and whatever. 
[01:25:30]  So we're in our room, and we also had our own bathroom in there.  So every night when we would get ready, she'd come out of the bathroom and look into this window, which was, um...  Sorry, Jackie.  No, seriously, what's up?  Oh, what's the matter?  No, I'm laughing because I looked at Jimmy, and I thought he was popping a tent.  So I looked down at his crotch and then looked at his eyes like, what's going on? 
[01:26:00]  And he goes, no, actually nothing.  It's just how my pants are.  Yeah.  I thought you were enjoying the story because all of a sudden you leaned back in your chair.  All right, continue, Jackie.  All right, I would have been doing pretty well in that case.  All right, so she would just come out of the shower and just totally strip down and, like, do her hair and, you know, blow dry her hair and, like, look into this mirror.  But it was a really good reflection.  So she's like, you know, this is like a full-length mirror.  And I'm like, but it's not. 
[01:26:30]  It's a window.  And across the way was a printing press.  And they would, like, stay up.  Boom.  Oh.  Just.  Boom.  A printing press.  Once the printing press entered the story, you lost me.  Oh, I'm serious.  Why is that important?  I bet you're serious.  Why is that important to the show?  You don't describe what kind of hot body she has.  The layout of the house.  Right.  Her flatmates.  We don't even get what color eyes she has, but we get printing press. 
[01:27:00]  There's a printing press.  We never knew what was going on across the way, but there would just be these guys, like,  gazing over at her.  And we're like, why are there so many men?  And it's, like, 12 o'clock at night.  What goes on in that building?  Right.  And then eventually later on we found out what it was and why there were so many guys up there.  A printing press.  Yes.  It was a printing press.  We can't get past the printing press part of the story.  Oh, across the thing, they made filaments, and the company has since got out of business. 
[01:27:30]  She could possibly have been the worst storyteller ever.  Across the way was the neck hole factory.  They make neck hole wafers.  Jackie.  The printing press.  What?  Did you travel back in time?  It just took a lot of time.  Someone's saying that is the best printing press story they've ever heard, though.  Yeah, well, you got that going for you, which is nice. 
[01:28:00]  What paper did they print?  Was it the Yorkshire Boring?  I had no idea what it was.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  God almighty.  The Yorkshire Boring.  He went with Yorkshire Boring.  Those people printing it out all night long.  Oh, the Boring.  Oh, God.  God almighty.  She had to give her the description of the building across.  The printing press.  Not really.  Which, you know, changed civilization.  Yes.  The printing press.  We talk to a lot more guys than girls on a daily basis. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  And this proves that girls don't really understand what guys are looking for in a store.  But we're not on satellite.  We're on regular radio.  Yeah, but printing press.  You can work around what she looks like, but you insisted on making sure everyone knew  that you lived across from a printing press.  It would have been much better on satellite if you would have been able to say f***ing printing  press, I'm sure.  Look, we understand that there's restrictions on free radio, but that doesn't excuse the  fact that you had to go into the description of the building across and what they did there. 
[01:29:00]  It didn't matter.  And why don't you just describe what that did to the actual quilted pen industry and how  there used to be a quilted pen press there, but then the printing press destroyed that  business and there was a suicide.  We don't even know how big the boobies were of your whore roomie.  No, there was no hotness in your description.  Right.  All right.  I'll be more descriptive next time, guys.  Well, just tell us.  Sorry to disappoint.  No, sweetheart.  You didn't disappoint at all.  You didn't.  You just humiliated yourself. 
[01:29:30]  What did she look like?  Can you tell us that?  She was like...  I'm not interested.  Okay.  All right.  We got a girl in Philly and we got a girl named Summer.  Now, those are two...  That's two good possibilities right now.  All right.  A girl from Philly and a girl named Summer from Cleveland.  Come on.  How much do you got to love Cleveland these days?  They're just all over the phones since we've gone live.  They kind of like the show.  They always like the show and they were kind of bummed that we were in afternoon drive on 
[01:30:00]  tape delay because they'd like to interact with this radio show.  They're animals.  We know that.  Love it.  And also, we got the man that proposed at half court during...  I think it was a Houston Rockets game.  Oh.  And, oh, it's just terrific.  The video is better than the audio, but we can make something of this after the break  as well.  And, oh, I was going to play...  Well, I was going to play...  I was going to play this.  I know my mom worries about me.  She's afraid I'll do too much too soon and with the wrong boy. 
[01:30:30]  That's why she got me this.  At first, I was a little nervous.  But when mom showed me how to use it, I knew boys could wait.  Now I can have my fun.  And mom doesn't have to worry.  Vibrators.  The smart choice for your future.  There you go.  I like the part where it goes...  We all know what's going on when you hear that. 
[01:31:00]  Vibrators not wanting to start up.  Like, oh, hurricane.  Why is this guy...  Glenn in Boston.  What's wrong, Glenn?  What's wrong?  You guys are pathetic.  You call out the women and you say you want the women to call up and tell the stories.  Then you do nothing but parade them after they get on the phone. 
[01:31:30]  This guy is absolutely right.  Hey, man.  What's up?  What's up?  I hope you can just say, hey, man.  What's up?  Dude, that's not true.  We love the...  Why are you tearing down one of our walls?  Oh, sir.  I'm sorry, guys.  I had to call and say that.  Hey.  Hey, sorry for your loss, man.  You guys are great.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  See ya.  All right, well, you know...  You lose anything?  Boston has no problem calling us out.  You know what?  Buffalo's not calling us out.  They're just sitting there listening and enjoying. 
[01:32:00]  Well, you know what?  We don't have patience.  Like, girls.  Yeah.  Guys want to hear what the girl looks like.  Not that you're across the way from a printing press.  That's the story, like, for the radio, you're not going to listen to it.  That's the story you'll listen to at the bar as you're trying your best to get this girl  into your car.  Then you'll listen and go, printing press?  Really?  Was there?  That's the type of story back in the day I would have listened to at 3.55 a.m. 
[01:32:30]  Right before the bartender says, get out.  They just called, last call, and this boar walks up to you.  This boar.  And the funny thing is, across, you can see them making aluminum.  This was aluminum.  If this was 11 p.m.  Printing press.  Printing press.  Stop.  Pony. 
[01:33:00]  Almighty.  Goddamn printing press enters that story.  Dummy.  And the homogenizing of the milk helps, right?  We did it.  Exactly.  It was a glazer across the way, glazing glass.  It was a mile down the house from Louis Pasteur's.  Was it?  All right.  Black History Month.  We only got one or two days left, right?  Well, thank God it's a leap year.  We got today's honoree.  But we're going to try this girl thing again. 
[01:33:30]  We got Summer from Cleveland.  We got Shannon from Philly.  Hang out, all right?  I know one of these will pay off.  Yeah, we're going to try to get a pay off today.  But first, your honoree for Black History Month.  Tell us about the cotton gin.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, African-American  individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot it  is today.  Today, we honor the legendary actor, composer, musician, performer, and voiceover artist,  Isaac Hayes, for his role as the ruthless warlord, the Duke of New York, in the 1981 John 
[01:34:00]  Carpenter film, Escape from New York.  Snake Plissken.  I've heard of you.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history.  I heard you were dead.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony, 877-212-ON-A. 
[01:34:30]  Hey.  Oh, all right.  And I was waiting for the, uh, just waiting for the words to kick in.  Sometimes you want the words to kick in.  I know we do a talk show, but.  I want to hear the words.  I want to hear the words.  Listen to the words. 
[01:35:00]  Me and Jimmy, did they listen to the words?  I think it became part of your stand-up for a while.  It did, actually.  We were driving to Boston, and I was turning Jimmy on to Nirvana Unplugged, and I actually  was like, oh, listen to the words.  And a book about words.  Yeah, I love that CD now.  Anyway.  Have you gotten into Alice in Chains Unplugged yet?  No.  That's a good one.  That is, uh.  I love that one.  That probably gets the most play on my iPhone.  Like when I'm using it as an iPod. 
[01:35:30]  Alice in Chains Unplugged?  Alice in Chains Unplugged.  Nice.  It's just every friggin' song is great.  Stupid Lane.  Stupid Lane.  And Jimmy was saying, just before we came back, that 48% of teenagers did not buy a CD  last year?  Yeah, I think so.  They were talking about how iTunes, Ant was mentioning how iTunes is going to take over  by the end of the year, probably for Walmart for the biggest place for music.  They're number one, or number two right now, for getting music. 
[01:36:00]  It's so much better that way.  You can pick and choose.  If you just want a couple of tunes, you get whole albums, and you're sitting there at  home.  Much easier could it be.  Why do they not have an iPod attachment in the car?  Once that happens, you can just pop your iPod on.  There must be a reason that they're holding off on that.  They have a few things like that.  I know I could put a jack into my phone, into the Mustang, and it goes through the radio,  so I could play it like that. 
[01:36:30]  But they should just have a built-in, pretty much a modem in your car for Wi-Fi that you  can just download stuff right in your car and download tunes.  Wi-Fi is going to just take over the world.  It's obvious.  Yeah.  It's heading toward that direction.  The future.  The future.  That's right.  Speaking of iTunes, let's not forget about the ONA animations.  They're in the podcast section.  Free downloads, and CokeLogic doing a terrific job.  Now, I see one that I haven't seen yet. 
[01:37:00]  Hot Dog Guy is now up there and being viewed, huh?  Yep.  It's the latest one out there.  A guy wanted to do a wow sticker stop out on the east end of Long Island.  Right.  And he owned a hot dog truck.  I'm like, man, you're just a horrendous businessman.  You can't even sell hot dogs, right?  He picked a very, very slow traffic area to sell his hot dogs, and it's now animated?  Yeah.  Oh, very cool.  And Steve's band, I haven't seen that one either.  Both on iTunes right now in the podcast section.  Wow. 
[01:37:30]  And we debut Foundry on the Opie and Anthony show.  And that's been...  That's been animated.  They animated Steve's concert outfit.  Oh, no.  And explores the name Stephen Carr.  All right.  In between shows today, could someone hook that up in the office?  I got to see both of those before we take the walk today.  So don't forget iTunes, podcast section, free downloads, ONA animations.  They're going up pretty much, what, one every other week?  Something like that?  All right.  And we're doing an animation contest.  Yes.  Yes, we didn't announce the winner of the bad one that this station did. 
[01:38:00]  We're doing a full-fledged...  Bad one.  Oh, it was horrible.  It was just poorly executed, but we have to announce the winner of that one.  Should we do that tomorrow officially?  Yes.  All right.  But we are doing a real animation contest now.  We already have $2,500 of prize money.  We're trying to get the prize money up to at least $5,000.  More details will be coming soon.  Go to our website that we can't mention.  But basically, animation contest, possibly a couple comedians, some other debauchery from this radio show. 
[01:38:30]  Looking for a legit venue, a really nice venue with a really nice sound system and screen.  We're going to take like the 20 or 30 best animations that they do for this radio show.  We're going to debut them on the big screen.  We ask the animators that are going to be in on this contest, don't spread your stuff around the Internet.  We want to keep it tight, close to our chest until we do this big animation festival.  And then what we're trying to do is hand out USB wristbands at the end of the night that have all the animations on them. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  And then spread them all over the place.  So we'll have more details.  But right now, we definitely have $2,500 in prize money.  And the prize money is going to go way, way up.  All right?  Nice.  Details on the way.  Let's go to Summer.  She hung through the break to tell us her story.  What's up, Summer?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Sounds energetic.  I love you.  Hello.  Thanks.  Is Jimmy in there?  Yeah, I'm right here.  He's barely here.  Honestly, I was having a shame moment. 
[01:39:30]  I just thought of an acting monologue I did.  Yeah.  And my head just got red and itchy thinking about how bad I was.  I apologize.  It was zoning out in my own head how bad I was.  Go ahead.  Was it bad?  Horrendous.  Humiliating.  Really?  Yeah.  I stunk.  Yeah.  Why would you just think about that in the mobile radio show?  Like this girl saying how much she loves you.  Something just hit me.  It was a moment.  It was a wording thing that connected me to something.  I was like, ugh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Really?  You know how the mind is so weird?  Yeah.  I was busy thinking about that toilet in there in amazement how you get stuff on the bottom 
[01:40:00]  of the toilet.  Yeah.  That was just disgusting.  But anyway.  You'd be surprised how closely associated what we were thinking was.  Yeah.  Right.  Summer, what do you got?  Well, that girl earlier made me want to rip my ears off her.  She told a horrible story.  Yeah.  Listen, I am 5'7".  There you go.  And I have, I'm 36F.  Can you say that?  Yeah.  You're what?  Can you say that?  Of course you can.  You're what? 
[01:40:30]  36F.  36F.  Are they natural Fs?  Natural.  You like Fs?  And I'm skinny.  And I'm skinny.  What?  What's your heart?  41.  What?  Oh, we can't hear you.  And...  No, Summer, back up.  We heard 36Fs.  And then what did you try to say?  And I'm skinny.  I'm at like 140, 145, 5'7".  5'7", 145.  That's barely skinny. 
[01:41:00]  Think about the visual that y'all are asking for.  Okay, you're voluptuous.  Yes.  Or voluptuous.  Oh, yeah, voluptuous.  Bodacious.  Either one.  Well, in addition to the fact that, like, I always leave my windows open and change and  then neck it or whatever in front of the windows.  But it's like one of my huge fantasies to, like, whenever I'm taking care of business  with myself is to kind of picture and visualize, like, some guy taking care of me and all these 
[01:41:30]  guys just standing around in a circle, like, watching.  Wow.  And just kind of, like, I don't know, them doing their thing and me getting my thing.  And I just think that that's hot.  Like, you can tell all these stories about these girls, like, having these guys watch  them or whatever.  But I think it's pretty hot that girls have fantasies about guys watching them.  Finally.  Wow.  We have a winner.  We got a winner. 
[01:42:00]  Winner.  Winner.  That was a girl.  That's how you tell a story.  There you go.  That was a girl calling and telling a story.  It worked out.  Yes.  It was concise, short.  Yeah.  Got to the hot part pretty quickly.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Could have done without that.  Huh?  I want to see Jimmy this weekend, but he's sold out.  Oh, but you have 36 Fs?  Yes.  Why don't you off air give your information to Travis, and we'll make sure we get you a 
[01:42:30]  complimentary ticket.  That's what I really want to go.  Well, consider yourself going.  I have a couple of comps per show.  So you can use one, and your breasts can use the other one.  But what about Maxwell's comp?  Oh, Maxwell doesn't need a comp.  He just walks in.  He walks in like Apollo Creed, and the lights follow him.  All right, Summer.  Enjoy the show.  All right?  Thank you.  Have another cigarette.  Yeah.  No, I like her voice.  Don't hang up.  You like that gravelly voice?  It's still all right. 
[01:43:00]  She's got to stop smoking, or it's going to get a bit bad.  I think we could squeeze this in.  Yes, we got a peeping Tom story, and Danny's got something to add to this, but here we go.  A woman gets the shock of her life when she finds that she's living below a peeping neighbor.  The man is accused of watching her through a hole that he drilled into her bathroom.  Looking forward to Hank Winchester is live in Romulus right now, and Hank, how did this...  I love that.  Guys are just amazing.  Because it's just such a hilarious visual. 
[01:43:30]  You're like, God, get to the nakedness.  I need to drill a hole.  Like, you had to go through the whole thought process of, she's right there.  She's right below me.  I'd like to see her naked.  Let's see.  My bathroom is here, so below me must be the bathroom that she showers in.  I could take some time, maybe, and get to know her, and maybe see her like that.  Or I could just drill a hole in the floor.  How dumb is the bra, though?  I mean, wouldn't you see the sawdust all over your shower?  Of course.  That's probably what tipped her off.  How do you think this guy got caught? 
[01:44:00]  Um...  The hole was too big?  Yeah.  Because you could drill a hole, a small enough one, that you're going to get away with this.  I would say hole's too big.  The problem is that these guys, they drill a hole that's a little too big.  How about a...  Like a...  You can actually see the eye...  You actually can see the eyeball blinking.  You don't want that.  We got greedy and drilled too many.  It's like bathroom ceiling with Swiss cheese.  She kept looking up and seeing this creep.  Yeah, he was hoping for a 10-camera shoot. 
[01:44:30]  Alan, Hank, how did this woman spot the hole?  Well, Ruth, when you see the hole, you'll...  Same time he was.  I think we're...  I think we got a winner here.  Yeah.  He said, when you see the hole...  Spot the hole.  Well, Ruth, when you see the hole, you'll agree it is hard to miss.  Take a live look behind me here.  You can see the...  Probably a manhole.  Well, not even a drill.  He chipped it out with a claw end of a hammer.  Right.  Just like banging it on the ceiling.  Must see nudity. 
[01:45:00]  I gotta see her naked.  Look behind me here.  You can see the victim lives on the first floor.  The accused people right upstairs.  The only thing separating those...  Pat Fominaki says you can notice the hole by the...  Flying out of it.  It looks like a geyser.  I don't remember having a bidet filled with tapioca.  Upstairs.  The only thing separating those two apartments is a little plywood. 
[01:45:30]  Police say that was nothing.  The guy...  Real.  Why?  He wasn't remodeling.  He wanted to take a look into the shower down below.  You know what I love?  That reporter is trying to show disgust.  Yeah.  Oh, stop it.  We all want to take a look down below.  I just cracked myself up.  No one ever gets away with this forever.  It's like, there's always...  A man was arrested.  Yeah.  It just never works out. 
[01:46:00]  Because you never can cover the hole up.  No.  Once it's there, it's there.  The size of the hole that this guy decided to drill wasn't really conducive to peeping.  It kind of looked like...  It looked like water damage on the ceiling.  Like, it was golf ball sized and there was like chunks of peeled away ceiling.  You know, like, kind of like...  It almost looked like someone had fired a round through the ceiling.  He just needed to see her.  It was ridiculous.  Wow, is that funny.  How long did it last?  I don't...  It couldn't have lasted very long because, I mean, you could tell...  There's no way there was... 
[01:46:30]  You were not noticing the hole in the ceiling.  Yeah.  There was no way you were not noticing it.  Yeah.  Paula Campbell points out a suspicious spot in the ceiling of her shower.  I was furious.  I was just straight furious.  That's the only word that even comes to my mind.  This spot is where she spotted another set of eyes staring right back at her.  I took a shower and I looked up, got soap in my eyes or something, and looked up and there was the hole.  Police say the people appearing at Paula was her neighbor, 43-year-old Douglas Nexota. 
[01:47:00]  He lives right upstairs in this Romulus apartment building.  Concerned, Paula called the cops.  We found some information in his apartment where he had ordered surveillance equipment, spy cams, and minicams.  He was...  All right.  There he goes.  High tech operation.  He's got the spy cam, the minicams.  He's hooking stuff up.  He's perverted.  What was he going to do?  Like, the hole was so big.  What was he going to do?  To shove a giant camera through the hole?  Just an old shoulder camcorder. 
[01:47:30]  He's shoving the whole thing through there.  So there's just a lens in the ceiling of her shower?  Like, what's that going to do?  Maybe he was looking for Avon.  Ah, a little wire reference.  All right.  This is for Jimmy.  Very nice.  I said I would just do wire references.  Oh, okay.  Out of nowhere.  Gotcha.  All right.  He was in the process of ordering some of that equipment, and he actually ordered it.  It was waiting for delivery.  Paula says she obviously feels violated, but now hopes the accused keeper does time in 
[01:48:00]  prison.  Hopefully it deters him from doing it to somebody else, and hopefully he learns a lesson from  it.  He's got the perf sweatshirt.  He went off.  You think he's at the window every day waiting for the FedEx truck?  Oh, yeah.  That's my spy equipment.  I need it.  Just in a froth.  I need my spy equipment.  That hole.  She's going to find it any minute now.  Yeah.  Because it's giant.  Danny, what happened to you?  I see on the disc that something happened to you.  Well, I used to, like about four years ago, I lived in a basement apartment, and you know 
[01:48:30]  how most basement apartments have those kind of quarter windows that are kind of off the  ceiling, because obviously you're half in the ground.  So I was fooling around with my ex-girlfriend, and I didn't have any curtains.  I was broke, so I didn't have any curtains or anything covering those windows.  I was, and we were fooling around on the couch, and I noticed that the lighting in the room  had suddenly changed, like almost as if like cloud had passed.  So I glanced over my shoulder, and I see a face pressed down against the window, like 
[01:49:00]  to the point where his cheek was touching the floor, and you have to be on all fours  to get down that low to see inside.  So I immediately call him on it, and I run outside, and I'm like, dude, what are you  doing?  And it's the landlord's son from upstairs, and it's not like this was like a kid in his  pre-teens.  Like this was a grown person with facial hair.  Like he had to be in his late 20s, early 30s.  And I said, dude, what are you doing?  He's like, what?  I'm like, you're busted.  Like I caught you.  He's like, what are you talking about? 
[01:49:30]  I'm like, dude, you were just peeping into my apartment trying to watch me do things.  And he's like, oh, no, no, no, I was fixing the sprinkler.  Looking in the window?  I'm like, no, you didn't.  He would not admit his guilt until months later where I had to confront him about it.  But that was not the only time that he tried doing this either.  There was another time, because I was in the basement, and there was a laundry room kind  of like right next to my apartment.  It was just, the only thing separating it was like wood paneling.  So I go to leave my apartment one day, and I had company over, and I open the door, and 
[01:50:00]  he's just standing there in the doorway.  And I say, because now I'm used to this kind of behavior, I go, what are you doing?  He goes, oh, I'm doing laundry.  But there was no laundry in the wash.  He had never...  I'm doing laundry.  I figured, all right, in 10 minutes, I'm going to hear laundry go off, and there was  never any laundry down there.  And I finally got him to admit later on, when I was leaving the apartment for good, that  he admitted that he was trying to watch me have sex with...  Really?  He fessed up?  He fessed up.  And I got it on tape, too.  I have a problem with your story. 
[01:50:30]  What's the problem?  It seems like you enjoyed the fact that the guy was watching me have sex.  No, I didn't enjoy it at all.  Because you didn't, like, cover up the window.  Or, hey, wait, this guy's going to be looking at us, and I don't want him looking at us,  so I'm going to put up a box or something.  After that caught him the first time, I did.  I blocked that window with a blanket.  You should have got a baseball, and then just, like, when he was ready...  Well, you would have broke your own window.  But how satisfying to bean his face through the window with a baseball. 
[01:51:00]  He was such a creep.  And I can't even believe that he admitted to my face that he was trying to watch me have  sex with women.  And it was just...  It was great bringing it up to his mother, which was my landlord, when I was leaving.  Because I'm like, I'm going to...  You could use my security for the last month's rent, because I'm not going to stay here anymore.  And she's like, why not?  And I was just like...  Because your son is attempting to watch me have sex.  Right.  And I, you know, and if that was the first time that I caught him, I could only imagine  the other times before that, when, you know, I didn't even catch the guy. 
[01:51:30]  When you were alone?  Oh, yeah.  All lathered up, read the magazine.  Watching filthy movies.  Trying to scrap.  Peek him.  Hey, very good.  Dennis in Boston, he writes, new bit, Peeping Tom Wednesdays.  You could have people call in while peeping in on their neighbors.  I say, go for it.  Maybe we do it tomorrow and just turn it into Peeping Tom Thursdays.  That's highly illegal.  How about this?  Anytime you're peeping, it doesn't matter what day it is, you're peeping on a Monday,  call then.  Yeah, let's do that.  Or actually, let's have the girls, they're in on this. 
[01:52:00]  How about, yeah, screw the guys.  They wreck these stories.  Yeah.  Hot girl calls.  All right, you know what?  I'm naked in front of my window.  Yeah, something like that, I think, is a little better.  All right, and a little safer?  Yeah.  All right, very cool.  We just got on in mornings in Cleveland.  We want to keep this job for a while.  Of course we do.  Thank you, Danny.  Anyway, speaking of Cleveland, we got some terrific audio from, what's his name?  Oh, Betty?  Benjamin?  Benjamin?  Benjamin Bornstein?  Benjamin Bornstein?  I think that's his real name, yeah.  I think so. 
[01:52:30]  The rest of the country is going to have to bear with us.  We got to slap a little boy around after the break.  Hey, look, he may be very open to his listeners.  I don't know.  He should be.  I don't know.  We'll find out next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  You're resonant a-holes.  Opie and Anthony.  I got a request. 
[01:53:00]  We love Pal Talk.  It's all over the place.  We were the first to do the Pal Talk thing.  Now it's like taking over radio, taking over the world.  Just a request, and I hate to do this, but please don't show your asses, girls, when  Anthony's ready to do a live read.  Thank you.  Holy mother of God.  That would really help me, Opie, run a tight ship here.  That destroyed me.  During the commercial break, it was Anthony's kind of turn.  I mean, not that we're that organized, but I figured Anthony was going to do the George  Carlin read because I'm trying to shove food down my throat because I think I try to 
[01:53:30]  eat breakfast in between the hilarity.  Anthony, and all of a sudden, I look at Anthony, and I'm like, oh my God, there's just dead  air because you're staring at a fine ass.  I mean, the ass is beautiful.  Don't get me wrong.  But the timing was awful.  Awful.  The cameras in front of me, or the monitors are in front of me, and then all of a sudden,  there's an ass on it.  And I was looking at the copy, but words weren't coming out of my mouth. 
[01:54:00]  No.  I saw what happened.  That's what was going on here in New York, if you're wondering.  The dead air was Anthony just staring at an ass when he was supposed to be, I don't know,  doing his job.  Did you see it?  Yeah, I did see it.  That's why I know what was going on.  There are times during the show I look over, and it's not even paying attention.  I'm like, all right, who's showing their ass now?  Who's showing their ass now?  It's about time we bring this to everyone's attention.  Let me tell you something.  There is a lot of text going by that I'm reading from Steve from Bayshore, Pat from Munaki. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  There's a lot of funny things.  This is my version of instant feedback.  There just happens to be girls that do show their asses.  Then read the instant feedback.  I do.  I do, because the visual part of the pal talk is really interrupting the flow.  See, look at this.  Text that?  Where?  Could I see that?  Exactly. 
[01:55:00]  We'll be in the middle of something like, oh, boy, who's showing their ass now?  Any single on top of it.  This is an ugly, ugly combination right now.  They're, you know.  All right.  Right there.  I know they're right there.  I'll talk.  Look, I take my peaks when I can.  When B-Rock allows you?  I'm not going to say I'm not partaking, but I wait for some boring commercial that's playing, 
[01:55:30]  and then I go, okay, I could take a moment to look at the hotness.  That's what Anthony was doing.  It just happened to be a commercial you guys were reading live.  Yeah.  I was doing it during the commercials.  Not funny.  Not funny.  They look at answers.  It's not funny.  Not funny.  Time to slap a little boy around who has no idea that they're looking for someone else  to replace him.  I hope he has that talk with management.  I hope management at least will be honest with him.  Jimmy's going to be, yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Stop showing your ass.  We've got 10 minutes left in the go.  Do you realize I'm standing up at the console, pressing myself into the, I'm humping the console.  I'll be 40 in July.  That ass is going to be the downfall of the Opie and Anthony show.  I got to bring it to everyone's attention.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What is this douche in Cleveland doing?  Yeah, here we go.  So Jimmy's going to be in Cleveland, what, Friday night for two sold out shows.  Everyone is begging for tickets.  You're going to be doing afternoons with, what's his name?  Dominic.  Dominic Nardello. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, he's been really good.  Well, his radio name is Nard.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  He's a really good guy.  He's very excited that we're doing mornings now for the station.  And Jimmy's going to be on Nard's show Friday.  Friday afternoon.  Friday afternoon.  So Cleveland, keep that in mind.  But here's little boy Maxwell, the midget with the beer belly.  What's his name?  Talking S on his radio show.  I believe it's Benjamin Bornstein.  Unless there's another rock star named Maxwell from somewhere.  Right.  But I think that he was in Florida under Bubba's tutelage or something.  Tutelage.  Tutelage. 
[01:57:00]  Under his fattelage.  Well, luckily, you have a whole other name you use outside of the radio program.  Oh, see, they had to acknowledge that.  Ah, they had to bring it up.  Like, yeah, we just bring this up anyway.  They had to acknowledge that, yeah, we found out his real name.  But why is it a single?  Who cares?  It's like, why don't you just use your name, dude?  Benjamin Boardstein.  Well, luckily, you have a whole other name you use outside of the radio program.  You could still deny that.  Let's not let anyone know what that is, right, Opian Anthony? 
[01:57:30]  Since you've already done that.  Well, let's talk about it to the whole country about a couple of dudes from Cleveland that  kicked your ass so bad you had to move to a different part of the day.  Wow.  That's a page from Rocco's book.  That's funny.  All right.  Oh, my God.  That's so pathetic.  All right.  First of all.  Is he annoyed that his name got out there?  Yeah.  Oh, dude, he is so annoyed that his name is out there.  Are you telling me that Benjamin Boardstein didn't tell his listeners?  No.  I don't believe it. 
[01:58:00]  He couldn't be that big of a hack that he wouldn't tell his listeners that that was his  name.  You know what?  I can't even play this audio because this isn't even a fair fight.  The guy, first of all, if you look up the radio show, we beat him in Afternoon Drive.  Yeah.  And that was with a tape show, which is embarrassing for everybody involved.  And now he's trying to tell his listeners that he kicked our ass so bad, kicked our asses  so bad that we had to move to a way better time slot.  To Morning Drive, which is the, you know, that's where you want to be in radio.  Everyone knows that. 
[01:58:30]  Like, oof.  Every radio guy in America wants to do mornings.  They don't want to wake up to do mornings.  Yeah.  What do you think?  We like getting up early and doing that.  You do this day part because it's the place to be.  It's the place to be.  This is the place to be.  You get more money as a radio show.  The advertisers pay way more money to have their product promoted on that show.  He did not just say that he kicked our ass so bad we had to move day parts.  The day. 
[01:59:00]  Pussies.  You're starting to feel a little better today.  At your big, high-powered radio show.  Hey, look.  I got news for you.  Guess what?  It's not a virus.  It's a radio show.  Right?  Yeah.  Get the virus old.  The virus is spreading.  I think of a woman.  Who talks like that?  Who talks like that?  Who talks like the virus is spreading?  Who's got the fake radio voice?  Maxwell.  You phony.  I'm going to call him by his radio name.  Maxwell, I'm very flattered that you know everything about our radio show.  Yeah.  Because I swear I don't know what you do. 
[01:59:30]  We played a couple of hack bits when we were talking about you, I don't know, about a month  or two ago.  But I don't know what you call your show.  I don't know any of the people on your show by name.  I don't.  I don't know anything about them.  The only thing I know is whenever we play anything, you have to goof on him with.  Which, by the way, we don't even listen to your show so we could goof on you.  We actually have people because we're such a huge, massive radio show, a huge force in  this business.  We got people working for the show.  We don't even know their names.  We're like, ah, can you just listen to that crap show and get the audio of it? 
[02:00:00]  We'll see when he starts whining that we let his name out.  Yeah.  This phony, his name got out and he's trying to make it seem like he thinks it's no big  deal.  I don't know why he would think it would be.  If your name is Benjamin Bornstein, be the rock star you want to be with your name.  Yeah.  That's who you are.  Use your real name, your real voice.  Is that crazy to want someone to do that?  Oh, it's spreading.  It's a viral infection.  So stupid. 
[02:00:30]  The virus.  You mean the show?  The show.  The show you do.  Oh, no, no.  The virus.  Right.  Right.  Idiot.  Idiot.  Someone's getting bothered.  Oh, is he bothered?  That's hysterical.  216-578-1007.  Just make sure you don't curse if you call that show because that will hurt the show.  I'm going to help him out, too.  Like, you're playing right into my hands.  I completely enjoy this, that we have annoyed you. 
[02:01:00]  You're only going to get a laugh from me.  Of course.  We got you so annoyed.  Yeah.  You know what?  Calling it the virus?  I have no problem with that.  I think that's kind of a cool thing because it is very viral and you turn other people on  to it and it takes on a life of its own.  What can I tell you?  It's a show.  Stop.  Be literal.  Not funny.  Not funny.  And shut up.  Shut up.  You are a douche.  Have you seen their stupid website? 
[02:01:30]  Have you ever actually seen it?  I've been on there.  Do we have a stupid website?  Wait, who's the hole?  Yeah.  Who's the hole?  Who's the hole they forced upon you?  Who's the chick?  Oh, that says it right there.  Shut up.  You didn't want a bitch on your radio show, did you?  Did you, Benjamin?  You didn't want the hole, did you?  No radio guy wants a hole.  It never, never.  But management forces a lot of these shows that don't have a say in their actual show  to make them hire a hole.  And you got to suck up to your PD because you're a pussy. 
[02:02:00]  You need to balance everything out.  So you got to get the holes pointed.  Can't make a decision for your own show.  You got to have people build your show for you.  And they said, put a hole in there.  And that's what you did.  Yes, boss.  Yes, boss.  Yes, boss.  And here she is chiming in with nonsense.  As he's listening to demo tapes in his office and you had no idea.  Yeah.  Listening to demo tapes of people that are going to be replacing you.  Maxwell, men are talking.  Shut her up.  Yeah.  Just tell her, look, men are talking. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, that's what you want to do.  That's what you want to have happen when you're trying to be a tough guy and take on  another show is have your bitch chime in.  Yeah.  I've been on there.  It's, I looked at it, what, on Friday?  Because I guess they were talking about us on Friday.  So I looked at it.  Oh, that was the only time you went there?  You're not there every day?  The red-headed one, that's Opie, right?  That's Opie, yeah.  He's got to have this, like, crazy kind of look like, hmm, hmm, huh? 
[02:03:00]  Good description on the radio.  Austin Powers, a spy who shagged me kind of, hmm, look.  And then there's the one guy that looks like, uh...  What is he even talking about, the pictures?  He's attempting to do his references.  I don't even know what he looks like.  He, he, he, the guy with the mustache.  That's, that's Anthony, right?  He looks like the only normal one.  And then Norton's got to be making a stupid, silly, ridiculous, crazy face, because he's  the crazy guy.  So he's going, like that.  It's so ridiculous.  I want to punch them all in the face. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, there it is.  I would punch you, but I'd hit, I'd hit your sleep apnea machine.  Stupid.  And this, the beauty of this guy, the beauty of this, how is he, how is he going to reach  up the punches in the face?  He's criticizing.  Midget with a effing beer belly.  Yes, Jimmy.  He's criticizing a photo that they used of me on the website because I have a strange  face.  Yeah.  Is that the best you have?  I'm talking about the content of your show.  Like, I'm telling you that as a, as a performer, Maxwell, Benjamin, you suck. 
[02:04:00]  You're not a funny, you want to talk about a photo of me?  Talk about the content of your show, dude.  Hey, who's the, uh, who's the teacher in South Park?  Uh, yeah.  Garrison.  Okay.  He looks like, what?  Oh, Mr. Mackey.  Yeah.  He looks like Mr. Mackey and he's going to talk about what we look like.  And meanwhile, he does, right?  Thank you.  You go to his website and isn't there, isn't his head superimposed on a basketball player?  Yeah.  Oh, you cornball.  He has online interactive games that he inserts his face into.  Does he? 
[02:04:30]  Ew.  Oh, stop it.  And he's a, and he's a rebel too, because he has a Starbucks logo and he has the line  through it like, uh, I don't, I don't do Starbucks.  Oh, wow.  Look.  Wow.  You're a madman.  You're crazy.  What's the, uh, their big show highlight is the Indiana Jones trailer.  Wow.  All right.  That's nice.  We don't drink Starbucks.  We don't do it.  We don't like it.  Put them all in the face.  He's going to be holding his microphone.  Oh, sour milk.  Oh, it's so stupid. 
[02:05:00]  So, are you going to try to punch me in the face?  That's all I need to know.  Because I will book a flight tomorrow, if, if, if that's a guarantee.  Are you going to punch me in the face?  It's just silly.  And then they went on and gave out like my real name.  Right.  And so.  Like, that's such a big coup.  Like, wow.  Hey, you know, Chunk, Snoop Dogg's real name is Calvin Brodess.  You hate him now, right?  Huh?  Huh?  Isn't he a scumbag? 
[02:05:30]  Kid Rock's real name is what?  Bob, uh, is it Richie?  Oh, this bothered him.  Okay.  Look, look, look.  This.  Snoop Dogg's real name is Shane French.  You hate him now, right?  Huh?  It's so stupid.  He is so bothered.  And how bothered is he?  Because he knows.  He is so pissed.  He knows his name.  Snoop's real name is.  You're comparing yourself with Snoop.  He had to look up other people's names and say them because he was so angry. 
[02:06:00]  We know Snoop's name because Snoop is not pretending to be what he's not.  Snoop's a gangster.  Yeah.  You are a little fat man named Benjamin Bornstein who's trying to be a rock star.  That looks like Mr. Mackey.  You look like Mr. Mackey.  You're not a rock star.  Okay.  Okay.  That is sad.  Oh, everyone.  That is just sad.  It's like, dude, you're not trying to give out your real name. 
[02:06:30]  It was given out.  I don't think it's a big coup, actually.  I don't think it's a big deal to give out your real name, and it shouldn't be.  If you're a real performer, you should give out your real name.  He's embarrassed by his name.  It's very obvious.  Why?  Benjamin Bornstein's a rock star name.  I hate Opie, my name, and I've said it for many, many years, but I'm stuck with it.  Acknowledge you hate your name, and that's why you changed it.  He wants something that he thinks sounds cool.  What's the last name he uses?  Maxwell something?  Smart?  No.  It's something.  It's going to make your scalp tingle when you hear it. 
[02:07:00]  It's so awful.  I want to punch him all in the face.  Do you, Benjamin?  Does Benjamin want to hit me, or does Maxwell?  Which one of you guys?  Is it the soft-spoken one at home that does the baby diapers, or is it the tough guy that  shows up to work?  We're going to go a little late, so I hope some of the stations stay with us.  I just hope Cleveland stays with us.  Yeah, stay with us, Cleveland.  Jeez.  Yeah, please.  Because this is too good.  Here's the next clip.  The stuff that's not true that people say, I could care less about.  Talk about all you want.  You know what I mean?  But when we're going to be called out for being liars and putting on this facade, we 
[02:07:30]  know everything there is to know about them.  The only thing I know about them is sex for Sam and Norton.  That's it.  That's good.  Good boy.  Only two things in my show right now.  Good boy.  Good boy.  For the longest time in Cleveland, we're out of work.  40 share.  We had it.  We're out of work.  Hold on a minute.  Wait, that is a W and I want a W. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  That's funny.  We're out of work.  That's funny.  Well, we were out of work, but we got paid the entire time.  You did?  We became even bigger because we were out of work.  We became national superstars.  Can you look at the picture?  International superstars.  But yeah, I guess you're right.  I guess you're right.  Look at the picture on his side.  His head is in pose.  There's a smiling face with his awful glasses.  And there's a picture of his head on a Cavaliers player. 
[02:08:30]  And you're complaining about my photo, you silly goose with a fake name.  Is it LeBron?  He put his head on LeBron James' body?  Oh, my God.  Because that's the type of body you wish you had, right?  Yeah.  What are you doing, Benjamin?  Yeah, really.  Stop it.  Benny Bornstein, what are you doing?  You're not going to win this battle.  And actually, we're very happy because we need people to know that we're on in mornings in Cleveland.  So you're really doing us a huge favor.  Thank you.  What's the matter, Rockstar?  Work. 
[02:09:00]  In which will happen again here.  Oh, absolutely.  Rest assured, you'll lose Cleveland.  You'll lose it.  You'll lose it.  But you won't talk about it because that's what you guys do.  We're the greatest in the world.  It's a virus.  We actually talk about every market we lose.  We talk about every negative thing more than we should, you silly boy.  We talk more negative than positive, I think.  Yeah, it's like this virus.  It's almost like a puddle of AIDS.  It's a virus like that. 
[02:09:30]  How about this?  You get infected and you slip it.  A puddle of Benjamin Bornstein.  Let's change it to that.  How about that?  I'd rather have a puddle of AIDS than a pile of fat fraud.  Benjamin Bornstein.  Rockstar.  Rockstar.  And the guy goes, there's a name that you use outside of this radio show.  You mean the one on your birth certificate?  No, you created a name.  Look on there.  It's Maxwell something.  It's going to make you physically embarrassed for him.  A puddle of Benjamin Tears because his radio career never took off. 
[02:10:00]  He's so sad.  And let me tell you something.  Let's say, God forbid, we lose Cleveland.  Well, then we're still on about 15 other stations and all over XM.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Everybody on radio wants to be heard by more people.  You're still being heard by one city and just a small part of one city.  That's terrific.  That.  Like, you get infected and you slip in a bucket of eight.  Phony laughing.  And then they soak you with monster rain.  He knows that. 
[02:10:30]  That's how we're bore fest on HBO.  Atta boy.  I mean, how embarrassed must, like, he be?  I've got to give you a dude.  Norton, I'll give you the one grape Kool-Aid joke with black people was funny.  But you must have pulled that from the relapse from three months ago from this radio show because you'd lifted it.  It's all good, dude.  Hold on.  Pause that for one second.  Just to let the silly.  That's why I hate radio, by the way.  I really do.  I'm not kidding.  I can't wait for someone to take me away from this whole thing because douches like this that will just openly lie about crap and there's no accountability. 
[02:11:00]  If there's a grape Kool-Aid joke that I did in Monster Rain, I hate to tell you this, that was taped in June in D.C.  So three months ago, I didn't know you existed when I taped that show.  And you know that.  So at least you just tell the truth.  That's all I'm asking you to do.  I'm being very honest.  You watched Monster Rain like a good fanboy?  If you didn't like it, why watch it?  Yeah.  Don't be stupid.  Don't torture yourself.  If people think I sucked, they don't watch me.  Good.  Don't.  But you watched it, fanboy.  And you sat there and you told Benjamin Bornstein what he needed to know. 
[02:11:30]  And Jimmy's going to show all of Cleveland how much he actually sucks at his two sold-out shows this Friday night.  It's a new show.  Not funny.  Not funny.  And I guess Benjamin's got a ticket at the door waiting for him, right?  That would be just, of course, if he wants to come, he wouldn't come.  And neither would stupid Stansfield or Stansbury.  Why is he lying and pretending he doesn't know who Opie?  Dude, you lie about your name.  You lie about your persona.  But at least be honest about the information you have. 
[02:12:00]  You know who Anthony Cumia is.  You know who Opie is.  Don't pretend you don't.  You even know my real name.  Yeah.  It's been printed so much.  It's not Opie?  No.  Holy Jesus.  What is it?  What are you hiding behind?  It's Great Hughes, okay?  You got me.  It's really Great Hughes.  Maxwell.  How long did he sit there trying to think that one up, you think?  Calvin Lotus.  I was just trying to think, hmm, what do I do?  Maxwell sounds cool.  And you know this... 
[02:12:30]  Doesn't sound like a fat loser.  This Benjamin guy's got to get in line, man.  There's a ton of people that are waiting to punch me in the face.  I mean, I'm still waiting for Bubba's punch to the face and Scott Farrell's punch to the face.  All three of us.  Who wants to punch?  Yeah.  From the relapse from three months ago from this radio show, because you'd lifted it.  It's all good, dude.  But other than that, dude, that was pretty bad.  That's so funny.  But you watched it.  I appreciate you watching.  Do you know how far into the set, the Kool-Aid, because I was doing the racial stuff in, that 
[02:13:00]  wasn't five minutes in.  Right.  I said, what are you doing?  Why would you waste an hour of your life watching a comic you don't like?  I don't get it.  He watched it.  Let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Okay.  Thank you.  And while he might be able to go, actually, I'm sure he could go out on a stage and kick  your ass pound for pound on the stage.  I will concede that.  On the radio, he sucks.  I got to tell you, dude.  I mean, Ratto is funnier than Jim Norton on the radio.  Dude, those people.  Why aren't these guys like discovered and doing like big time radio?  They should be all over the place.  You should be syndicated. 
[02:13:30]  You should be syndicated.  You should be, your agent should be negotiating big deals for you.  All over the country.  Why aren't you?  Can I tell you something?  This radio business, there's not a lot of talent.  Yeah.  They're desperate.  They're desperate to find like new talent that could be heard in a lot of markets.  So what happened there, Maxwell?  If what you're saying is true, all you have to do is send a tape to a corporate office somewhere  and you'd be all over America.  They're dying for funny, creative, entertaining people to do radio. 
[02:14:00]  Absolutely.  They just can't find them.  They just can't find them anywhere.  On the radio.  Dude, those people.  Those of you listening right now that listen to us religiously know, dude, I'm not the  kind of guy that likes to pat myself on the back.  But dude, when it comes to this.  You're too fat to reach.  Pound for pound.  That dude?  Please.  You can bring him on all day.  I can tell women to have abortions at Walmart too, idiot.  You might as well.  You'll be working there sooner or later when the show gets canceled.  That's what you struggle with a little bit.  Silly goose. 
[02:14:30]  Stop paying so much attention to what I say and say something funny yourself.  Stop reacting.  You don't stand up, dude.  I'll give him that, man.  He's been doing it forever.  And yeah, he probably is.  Leaps and bounds.  Which, Norton, if you ask.  You just said how much he sucked.  Wait.  You just said that.  You stand up.  You give it to me.  Give me a minute.  See?  That's what happens, kid.  You're lying.  Tell the truth.  Wait.  You just said how bad his HBO special was.  But now pound for pound you think I'm funny.  Stop.  Stop at the pound for pound thing.  We're not boxers.  Stop trying to make it more mano to mano than it is. 
[02:15:00]  You're with a fat boy who uses a fake name.  That's the end of it.  Little boys with a radio show.  Ah.  Just leave some bounds.  Which, Norton, if you actually, with all due respect, if you were a top-notch comic,  You wouldn't have to do a crappy radio show.  Oh, please.  You wouldn't have to play third chair on a radio show.  It's third mic, stupid.  Not third chair, you old lady.  It's third mic.  He knows it's third mic.  He just messed up.  But how is this a crappy radio show?  You do pay attention.  We're on a lot of stations.  Yeah.  And we're the number one channel on XM.  He knows that. 
[02:15:30]  Play third chair on a radio show if you were that good.  Dude, if I was a touring comic, do you think I'd even talk to Maxwell?  I wouldn't even do the show when I came into town.  When I came into town to do playoffs, I'd be like,  Dude, I'm not talking to that idiot.  Because he's a hack.  We have a lot of comedians that tour all across the country  that can't wait to do our show on a regular basis.  Huge names in common.  No, he's right, though.  As a stand-up, because I go out and do weekends,  I guess I should not want to be creative for five hours a day.  No.  You silly fatso. 
[02:16:00]  Don't trash your own profession, dummy.  What's the matter with you?  God almighty.  That's like saying I'm having sex with his wife and my own chick,  and he's going, Why would you want to have sex with my wife?  She's awful.  Dude, don't trash your own gig.  Radio's a great gig.  You love it, and I love it.  We happen to have that in common.  Don't try to find a way why I shouldn't love it.  It's silly.  I do love it.  Jimmy's going to have a fun time in Cleveland Friday.  Dude, I mean, and I don't talk about the things I've done.  It's like, look, I'm in your town, your town. 
[02:16:30]  I get two sold-out shows.  The people are not going to be very big fans of yours.  Yeah.  So deal with that.  Deal with that, Benjamin.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  We dropped this call for some reason.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  You know the thing that's not funny about Maxwell?  What?  He's so phony.  Am I to believe that someone in radio doesn't even know your guy's name,  but doesn't know who's who or what your website looks like?  It's so obvious he's acting and lying.  It's so annoying. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I think, I don't think his listeners are buying into that.  I think they're kind of getting the, you know, the douches, if you know what I mean.  That's just douchey stuff.  I mean, it's just not honest whatsoever.  He's a fat phony.  So anyway, good luck, guys.  Have a good day.  All right.  I'm not bothered by it.  It just makes me laugh because he plays right into our hands.  Yeah.  It's hysterical how angry he got when he started saying other people's real names.  But he mentioned guys like Snoop.  He kept mentioning the gangsters. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, because he's on the same level as Snoop.  And Kid Rock.  And who was the other one?  He mentioned guys that are pretty cool.  Like, this is how he sees himself.  Yeah.  It's like, you're not a hardcore gangster rapper.  You're not a rock star like Kid Rock.  You're a fat man in Cleveland.  That's what you are.  All right.  Oh, there you go.  We had fun today.  Benjamin Warnstein.  Please scream that at him when you see him.  When you call this radio show on the numbers we've given out, please say that you want  to talk to Benjamin Warnstein.  1-800-348-1007. 
[02:18:00]  216-578-1007.  Just tell the board up you need Benjamin Warnstein.  All right.  That's who he is.  Sweet goose.  And like a good boy, you'll stop talking about us when the company tells you enough is enough.  On onaradio.com, can we please put up this picture of this monstrosity?  Look at that disaster.  This fat load.  He's a fat Mr. Mackey.  Right?  Look at him.  Yeah.  He's in a hockey jersey.  What is he talking? 
[02:18:30]  Why is he even talking?  It's Sandsbury.  All right, guys.  Oh, my good God.  The hat.  We're off to XM because we're not a successful radio show.  Yeah, we suck.  I'm really sorry that we're not more successful for you people.  So I guess we got to go do that so we can pay some bills.  I don't know.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm real excited.  Real excited.  Is that amazing?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:19:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie.  The Opie.  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Thank you. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you. 
[02:20:30]  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  Thank you. 
[02:21:30]  Thank you. 
[02:22:00]  Thank you. 
[02:22:30]  Hey, do we still have pests?  Yeah, I think so.  Do we really?  Still have a few on the roster.  We still have a few?  Yeah.  I encourage a full-out pest attack on Maxwell's show in Cleveland.  Maxwell.  I encourage it.  I encourage it.  I encourage it. 
[02:23:00]  Please.  I'm actually going to say please.  Ooh.  Right, Jimmy?  Are we encouraging an all-out attack on Maxwell with the pests?  Yeah, I don't even know if we had pests anymore.  I don't even know if we had pests anymore.  I hope we do.  I mean, I think they can hear listening to this guy just what a phony cunt he is.  I mean, we didn't start this fight with this dude.  We never heard of him.  And all of a sudden, Opie and Anthony used to be funny.  What's that, Jim Norton?  It's like we had never heard of this dude. 
[02:23:30]  So it's not like we were talking shit and we want the listeners to fight our fights for us.  This guy just started attacking us, which is fine.  But now he's fucking, here's what he's trying.  Why would they go after two douchebags in Cleveland?  That's the fucking first sign of the white flag.  And the second sign is you fat little bitch.  Stop being embarrassed that you're not Calvin Brodus.  Calvin Brodus was a fucking, I believe he was a, what was it?  What did he say?  A-Trey Crip?  Yeah.  He did not get the gang wrong, but he's a fucking gangster for real. 
[02:24:00]  He's not pretending to be a gangster.  Calvin Brodus is actually pretending to be less gangsters than he really is.  You think Snoop's real vibe is an AOL commercial with Lee Iacocca?  No.  Snoop's a fucking gang member.  He's a tough dude, man.  Slinging dope.  Yeah.  He's a problem for real.  Yeah.  He's not pretending.  Mr. Mackey is the guidance counselor.  Yes, he looks like a Mr. Mackey if Mr. Mackey was bloated from filling up with,  oh, food and stuff.  Hey, here we go. 
[02:24:30]  We do have pests.  Blue Heeler, Kentucky.  I'm on it, Greg.  Coke Logic, whack bag.  You got it.  Not Greg, though.  Opster.  And that's it.  Opster.  We got two pests left, I guess.  Oh, that's it?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, no.  We got Steve from Huntington.  You've got the pest tactical group at frunkist2.com.  Check it in, sir.  Frunkist.  And then you get this.  Dan and Sam have a better radio show than Maxwell.  I thought they were going to say that to us. 
[02:25:00]  Sort of a backhanded compliment.  And we're getting called out, and now...  It's a compliment at all.  We got to acknowledge Ernie E. from Colorado, Anthony, because he writes,  30-minute walkover, another show stolen from XM listeners.  Ernie, let me explain what happened.  Oh, boy.  We heard that Coke Logic's animations...  This is the true story.  The two new ones he did, one on Steve and his band Foundry,  and the Hot Dog Guy, were now up on iTunes.  And I'm behind the Coke Logic animations.  I haven't seen those yet, so I go, 
[02:25:30]  could you please set those up in the office?  In between shows, I want to see these animations.  And they're available, of course, on iTunes in the podcast section.  You can download them for free.  All XM asks that you see a five-second commercial  before the animation starts.  Yeah, deal with it.  I really thought they were short animations,  but they're both about three minutes long and hilarious.  Really funny.  We had the whole office just dying.  That fucking Coke Logic.  God damn it, man.  I know.  That bastard is so good.  Really good.  That one with Steve talking about his band Foundry 
[02:26:00]  in the song Pendulum.  The Steve animation is Steve.  Oh, yeah.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, I smile more, Coke Logic.  I just want to throw that out there.  Maybe in a future animation you can...  Oh, no.  I like the grim.  I like the grim looks.  Yeah, but I'm grimming as you two are hysterically laughing beside me.  I like your grim look.  Awkward.  Awkward.  It's just evilness.  He's got Jimmy's evil eyes, too, man. 
[02:26:30]  Those just raid attack eyes.  I love it.  He's just fucking...  Coke Logic Bravo, by the way.  I met him in Chicago for the first time  and he started talking about animation and stuff like that.  And, oh, that fucker is good, man.  Yeah, he knows his shit.  It's a great part of the radio show now.  Absolutely.  It's so funny because it takes, you know,  just one of the bits that we've done  and adds such a cool twist to it.  Mm-hmm.  You know, there are little things that he pops in there.  I'm getting excited about the animation festival.  I think this is going to be huge for us.  Yeah.  We've got to get an update.  I know we have $2,500 in prize money so far. 
[02:27:00]  We're expecting a lot more from XM.  We're expecting a lot more from the other side  if they want to get involved.  But they can't fuck with our contest on the other side.  I mean, if people want to do a little edgier stuff,  that's cool, too.  Yeah.  Although we love clever over fuck.  Yeah.  That's our only rule.  If you're going to do, like, some fucks and stuff,  make sure it's in a clever way.  That's all.  That's all we've ever asked.  RadioGoldFans.com.  They're on it. 
[02:27:30]  They're on the pest attack.  Very good.  Yeah.  Fuck this guy.  He's just...  And the thing I like to do is allow somebody's awfulness...  It's like that guy Stansbury was trashing the special,  which is...  If he said, I watched five minutes of it and turned it off,  I'd have no issue with it.  Right.  But the fact that there's a line 15 minutes...  What are you doing to yourself?  He's picking a line, yeah.  Yeah.  That's 15 minutes into the special.  I don't get it.  I want to make it perfectly clear, too.  We're not attacking them because we're scared of them.  We're just bored. 
[02:28:00]  I don't think anybody thinks that.  I think they understand.  We're fighting...  The guy bashed us,  and when somebody bashes me,  I like to bash them back.  It feels good.  I'm a vindictive trick.  I don't think there was...  I'm going to think now,  which I rarely do.  I'm trying to think if we ever were scared  taking on another radio show.  Well...  The closest would be Howard,  but we weren't really scared of that either.  There's nothing scary about these people.  They're just fucking losers. 
[02:28:30]  They're just bad at what they do.  They know everything about us.  You know?  We downplay our influence,  but the fact is,  there's a lot of younger radio shows  that look up to us.  We hear it from all the comedians.  This is something  we've never really brought to the...  Well, it's come to the table, I guess,  but we don't harp on it.  A lot of comedians,  when they're doing their thing across America,  they're like,  oh, dude, I was in whatever,  some small city in the middle of whatever,  and I was on this radio show,  and there were huge fans of you guys.  Yeah.  And we get that so much 
[02:29:00]  from the guys  when they're on the road  doing the radio.  It's just...  The thing is,  we've been in radio long enough  and had enough stuff happen  that if you're in the business of radio,  you know who we are  just because of...  Whether you think we're good or not  or whether we are good or not,  it doesn't even matter.  The thing is,  we've been in enough situations  where we've gotten either in trouble  or whatever,  where if you're in the business, 
[02:29:30]  you know who we are.  You know what we're all about.  Yeah, the press...  That's all.  The press clippings from this show,  because I've saved  just about every single piece  that's ever written on us.  It's just one of these  weird OCD things I have.  And trust me,  I don't have all of them,  but I have a majority of them.  I'm not even lying to you  because I was going through this  the other day  because I'm unloading boxes.  I got these huge plastic containers  that I got from the container store  that are...  How far am I?  Like four feet across?  The container store. 
[02:30:00]  They're four feet long  and about a foot deep.  I got four of these  completely filled  with press clippings  from this radio show.  Completely filled.  And then another box,  I don't even know  what to do with those yet.  They would probably...  The press clippings from this show  would probably go  from floor to ceiling.  So with that alone,  if you're a radio guy,  you know who we are.  So stop lying.  The thing that annoys me is this.  When he's pretending he doesn't...  Well, I hope he's the redhead.  First of all, it's more blonde.  And then...  Which annoys me  when anyone gets his hair color wrong.  And then...  The guy with the mustache. 
[02:30:30]  I looked at your pictures once.  I knew which one was Stansberry  or Stansfield.  I asked that name.  I do fuck up.  And which one was Maxwell.  Like, I knew.  And I will know now.  Every time I see a photo,  who's who.  So what you're doing is,  besides being a radio hack  who uses a phony voice  and a fake name,  you're fucking lying, dude.  Yeah.  You're a liar.  And that's embarrassing.  Yep.  Let's...  I lied a couple things in my life.  That's it.  Yes, I suspected  it wasn't a girl.  Let's leave it at that.  Let's see.  Nuff said. 
[02:31:00]  And then you think I stole  a grape soda joke from the...  Dude, why would you lie about it?  You know that's not the truth,  but you're saying it anyway.  Jimmy takes pride  in not lifting stuff  from other people.  Like, he's obsessed  with not lifting.  This is something  we don't talk about much either.  There's some jokes  that Jimmy does  that are similar to  jokes that his friends do,  and they never saw  each other's act.  Know what Jimmy does?  He steps aside and goes,  you know what?  I can't do that joke anymore.  No.  And he knows it's a really good joke,  but it's close to...  No, it's tainted.  It's close to another joke  that I'm just going to say  a friend of yours did as well. 
[02:31:30]  And it wasn't because  Jimmy all of a sudden  decided to rip off his friend.  You know,  they were thinking alike.  They came up with  similar material.  And all of a sudden,  Jimmy's like,  I can't do that material anymore.  And I'm like,  there was one joke.  It was Stan, right?  There was one joke.  I'm like,  Jimmy, you've got to continue doing it  because it's hilarious.  I forgot which joke.  And Jimmy's like,  I just can't anymore.  That's the type of comedian  Jimmy is.  It's called parallel thinking.  Like, I do a bit  on Hillary Clinton.  I'm trashing her cankles.  And Nick DiPaolo  makes fun of her cankles.  Nick didn't see me do that. 
[02:32:00]  I didn't see Nick do that.  I walked through the cellar  one night and he was doing it.  No one took that.  It's just two comics  attacking a presidential candidate.  Two misogynist pigs.  Of course you're going to go  after her fat ankles.  So it's like,  there are certain things  that happen in comics  which everybody knows.  But what he's saying  is dishonest.  I'm boring myself  with this explanation.  If it's any consolation  to the listeners,  I am hating my own voice  right now.  Not funny.  There we go.  I feel better.  Not funny.  Not funny.  Not me.  Benjamin Bornstein.  Not funny.  Not funny.  Maxwell.  Dangerous and funny. 
[02:32:30]  And pound for pound, dude.  Same thing.  Same real manly example  for two fat guys.  Pound for pound.  I'm going to use  boxing analogies.  Pound for pound.  Duke it out.  Why are you doing that?  How about fucking this?  Donut hole for donut hole.  I think you're more  of a heart attack risk.  Let's go with  the fucking analogies.  You fucking apnea cunt.  Obi, could you have  the clipping scan  and put on the site  would be an interesting  read, I believe.  It's going to be  such an interesting read  that I think I'm going  to write a book  on the press clippings  alone. 
[02:33:00]  Are you sleeping, Steve?  Steve?  No.  No.  You're breathing.  What's up, Steve?  Nothing.  I just wanted to call  and let you guys know  that when this all started,  I used to hang out  with Stansberry  a while back.  And I tried calling in  knowing that he would  know my nickname,  everything,  and I know this guy.  They will not let  anybody get through.  Well, that's real radio, huh?  Oh, yeah.  It's lovely.  There's a show  that's not scared.  What's the problem 
[02:33:30]  with these guys, dude?  Stansberry,  I dislike him a lot less  because I think  that he's more  with a guy,  Stansberry just got  lucked up on a gig  and he doesn't want  to fuck up his gig.  What's the problem  with Benny Bornstein?  Yeah, I think  Benny Bornstein  might be sticking up  for his boy Bubba  or something.  I don't know.  This is so incestuous.  What do you think?  Let me tell you this, guys.  Yeah.  Stansberry is doing it  for the hoo-ha,  for the pussy.  Yeah, I don't blame him.  And that is the only reason.  I don't blame him for that. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  But they have no balls.  And I said,  I tried to get a hold  of him even off air  and he won't even talk to me.  And I don't get it.  Because he wasn't  like that before.  You know the guy  personally, right?  Yes.  So you know his email  and his number  and you can talk to him?  Well, I know his number.  I don't know his email  because I kind of lost  touch with him  over the past couple years.  Okay.  But he will not  give back to me.  Nothing.  I went through another buddy  to try to get him  to talk to him.  Yeah.  And it's like he knows 
[02:34:30]  or somebody's telling him  don't talk to him  because they see  my silly wow sticker  that's been on my car  since 2001.  Right.  And they know  that I'm all for you guys.  So I just want to talk to them  and know what the hell  why they have a problem with it.  Yeah.  They won't admit it.  There's a jealousy.  All right.  Thanks, man.  There's a jealousy thing  that happens with radio guys.  They know how successful  we've been  and they just can't understand  why they're not as successful.  Yep.  If you get me 
[02:35:00]  Stansberry's number  I'll call him.  All right.  And ask him.  What's the Maxwell numbers again?  Actually, I want all phone numbers  from I don't even know  if we have passed.  We'll see if we do  with this little thing  because, you know,  we got to disrupt everything.  Everything.  What's up, Dave?  We need you.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey, I want the number.  I want to call  and mess around with them.  Well, they're not on  until what, afternoons?  Three o'clock.  Three o'clock.  You call the station.  Hey, I'll call then.  That'll annoy them.  Yeah, you can call now, though.  Call the station. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Call the station  and just mess around  with them now.  Well, it's up to you.  You can request a song.  You can yell  Benjamin Bornstein's a cunt.  Whatever you want to do.  I would definitely do that.  Don't yell.  I'm here for you guys.  You know?  Hey, thank you, sir.  Thank you, Dave.  Don't yell.  What's the number?  Hold on.  We'll get the numbers.  Dave's got it right now.  Oh.  800-348-1000.  Oh, I was going to say 1007.  That's too confusing.  800.  Hold on.  800-348-1007. 
[02:36:00]  1007.  1007.  What's the 216 number?  216-578-1007.  1007.  Excellent.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  You guys are great.  Let's tape it if you want.  Have some fun.  Yeah, let's go to Cleveland.  Erin, what's up?  Oh, I play roller derby,  and we were last minute meeting a halftime show,  and they decided to call Maxwell,  and he was available.  Of course he was.  He always is.  A halftime at a roller derby?  Oh, God.  All right, so what we should be doing 
[02:36:30]  is talking about Opie and Anthony from 10 years ago,  because that's the stuff we used to have to do.  They would force us to do.  How about 12 years ago?  12 years ago.  We had to do that type of thing.  Yikes.  Well, the thing is, is that, you know,  I guess people were kind of excited, you know,  local celebrity, whatnot,  and the guy comes out, says hi,  gets the crowd going all crazy,  and then he walks out.  That was it.  Oh, he's terrific.  Do you have,  it was probably New Year's Eve  until he was available.  Do you have audio of that?  I'd love to have audio of him. 
[02:37:00]  How desperate are you guys in Cleveland  that you got excited by an appearance by Benjamin?  I know, a celebrity.  Oh, my God.  Benjamin Bornstein, here to entertain you.  At the roller derby.  Did he hum the fucking Jim Croce song  and then eat something  that hopefully sent him into a diabetic coma?  Yeah, they couldn't get anyone  from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  My God.  You have a crunch bar, fat boy.  You're fucking happy.  Fuck you and Reggie White.  It was our championship bout.  What's that?  It was our championship bout,  and I don't know if he just ran out of options,  and it was really pathetic.  He was out there for maybe three minutes, 
[02:37:30]  and then we had a bunch of,  maybe 15 minutes left of nothing.  Look, he can't stand in front of a fucking,  he can't stand in front of an audience like a man.  He can't stand up there and entertain like a man.  He can't do it.  Hey, let's find out when he's going to have  his next live appearance,  because he's in for a rude awakening.  Ooh, those are evil.  I want someone to bring a sign that says,  Benjamin Bornstein is a fat cunt.  And lest you think we don't do things like that,  we fucked up a blood drive once. 
[02:38:00]  Wait, what?  That was awful.  What happened?  I don't remember.  Remember Rocko was hosting a blood drive?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And we sent people down there  and just disrupted his fucking broadcast.  Yeah, it's going to be...  We were all pissed at us.  They're trying to do something nice,  and you're motherfuckers.  Yeah, whatever.  Shut up.  He don't take phone calls on his radio show.  Of course he doesn't.  No.  Why would you?  Why would you if you're going to get killed like that?  Being exposed is a phony.  Thank you, Erin.  Thank you.  Can I just say one more thing?  Go ahead, baby.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  We are very excited to see Jim Norton,  and that's me, myself, and I.  Oh, thank you very much.  Come over and say hi.  I'm the roller derby girl.  And then put your anus on my nose.  Yeah.  That's the code between us.  Yeah, that's the signal.  That's the Jim Norton greeting.  You know how the Eskimos do their thing?  Norton's got a special greeting.  That's right.  Nose to nose, there's too many ways to get cold.  Yeah.  Nose to anus, it's just.  Jim's greeting is shared by collies everywhere.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Let's go to John in Kansas City.  John, how are you?  Hey, what's going on? 
[02:39:00]  Hey, man.  I just wanted to call.  I heard the radio show yesterday and today.  I just got a new card.  It's got XM in it, so I'm listening to you guys all the time, because you guys are hella  funny.  Thank you.  And I don't know why this guy's talking shit.  I've never heard of this guy, and I really haven't heard of you guys, but you guys sound  a lot more funnier than some of the stuff that I've checked on on the internet with  this guy.  Thank you.  Hey, John.  Thank you.  I mean, what, two days in?  Yeah, two days in.  Two days listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  This is a very interesting little thing we like to do.  After two days, what do you like about the Opie and Anthony show? 
[02:39:30]  Oh, the brand new fan.  That's all right.  He's been initiated.  Welcome.  Welcome to the club.  We're garbage.  We all have low self-esteem.  We don't take compliments well.  Tell us we suck.  We'll keep you on for 40 minutes.  Three seconds of you guys rule, and we got to go.  It makes us all tingle.  Yeah, let's say hi to Jeremy.  Jeremy, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Got two questions for you.  Hey, Opie, should I load up the hot air balloon and load up the bras? 
[02:40:00]  You can do it all good.  Yeah, fire up the hot air balloon.  A couple of people have suggested we go the balloon route.  Yeah, sure.  And should I camp outside of the Buzzard's radio station?  Well, it's 107.  Is that what it's called?  The Buzzard?  Yes, the Buzzard.  MMS, I think, right?  That's cute.  Or R?  Should I camp outside and say hi to him every afternoon?  Absolutely.  Make sure you record it, though, because it's no use if you don't record it. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, not a problem.  I can even hold up that fat cunt sign if you want, Jimmy.  If you did that with a photo of Maxwell is a fat cunt.  No, Benjamin Bornstein is a fat cunt.  Benjamin Bornstein.  And this one, nice apnea, dick.  I hope he goes through the fucking windshield.  He's trying to be a tough guy on the radio and he's got sleep apnea.  Oh, he just stinks.  Sorry for the people that have it.  Sorry, man.  Not a problem at all.  Oh, Jimmy hasn't?  Not funny.  Not funny. 
[02:41:00]  I woke up 1,400 times last night.  Not funny.  All right.  Pound for pound, we get it.  You're a boxer.  All right, Jeremy.  Thank you.  Benjamin Bornstein.  He's a nice boy.  He has trouble sleeping.  Yeah.  He eats matzo ball soup but disagrees with him.  Why upset your mother?  Let's see.  It's not funny.  Who's this Maxwell character, Benjamin?  Who's this Maxwell character running around with the girls in the bikinis?  Ma, that's what they like. 
[02:41:30]  I think we got some pests.  You want to be called Maxwell?  I know you, you murderer.  Zell, the fat sleep apnea doctor is here.  And then Olivier cuts his throat.  This man can't breathe when he sleeps.  He needs a doctor.  Jim, you think you're funny?  I mean, that was...  I don't know.  Pound for pound.  It was a fucking marathon man reference, my friend.  Why would I want to do a fucking radio show?  That was kind of funny. 
[02:42:00]  But pound for pound.  I mean, you're going to have to do a little better.  What a douche.  Stansbury.  Bob, Pennsylvania, what's up?  Yeah, guys.  I just wanted to let you guys know I used to listen to Bob and Tom and then Mike and Mike.  But nobody compares to you guys.  You guys rock, guys.  Thank you.  Mike and Mike suck.  If you found those numbers, I will be calling him.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, we got to rent a plane to circle his radio station at three.  Yeah, that's a good idea. 
[02:42:30]  With Opie and Anthony rules Cleveland, right, Benny?  Yeah.  Benny.  Benjamin Bornstein.  Benjamin Bornstein.  Just like Calvin Brodus.  Yes, except he's a gangster.  And you're a fat man who doesn't sleep without machinery taped to his face.  That's the difference.  Snoop does nothing but fuck hot chicks.  And you tell Stan's cunt how funny he is ton for ton.  And how he's the greatest thing since fucking a sliced stroke.  Yeah.  Shut your face, Benjamin.  You're embarrassing yourself.  You got to sleep with a Darth Vader mask. 
[02:43:00]  Of course you do.  Because you look like him without the helmet.  Except you're less amusing.  You fucking Donald Pleasance looking jizz bag.  Dave, Chicago, what's up?  Man, you boys need pests?  Yes, sir.  Yeah, we need pests.  Wowee.  The boys get pests.  Don't make a fucking thing yet, got it me.  The boys get pests.  Thank you, Dave.  Linger longer on that one.  Brad, Cleveland, how are ya?  How are ya?  What's up, boys?  What's up?  By the way, just taking live calls. 
[02:43:30]  Not one fucking Benjamin fan calling in.  What do you got, Brad?  Benjamin's a douche.  You got to say his whole name, Benjamin Bornstein.  Bornstein.  I don't want to rob him of his last name.  It's Bornstein.  He's a good boy.  Hey, why are they, uh...  All right, go ahead, Brad.  Sorry.  Ah, no problem.  Hey, I just wanted to get in and let everybody know that the station is at downtown.  Okay.  It's actually out in Independence, Ohio.  It's about 10 miles south of downtown Cleveland.  Okay.  6200 Oak Tree Boulevard. 
[02:44:00]  There you go.  What's the, um, what, 1600 Oak Tree Boulevard, and what's the, uh, zip code in case people  want to mail in?  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, 6200, not 52.  Oh, 6200.  Yeah.  Yep, 4-4, um, there, it's, it's, uh, just like an office complex area, so it's, it's not  like downtown would be.  Okay, so people want to mail anything.  If you get a zip code, too, they can mail a thing.  Maybe they'll want to mail, hey, we're fans.  I believe it's 4-4-1-1-4, I think.  Okay.  All right, very good.  Hey, if you're a fan of Benjamin Bornstein, tell him. 
[02:44:30]  You don't have the bad mouth.  He sucks ass.  Oh, language, sir.  We don't like that type of talk here.  That sucks ass.  Hey, Oak, Midwest Militia's got you.  We got 33 members, and we're coming strong.  All right, look at that.  We do, we still have some pests.  I'd like to hear that.  We haven't, uh, acknowledged the pests in a while.  I know they're out there.  I wasn't sure how many, but it looks pretty good.  Looks pretty good.  Always looking for new recruits.  The pests are just evil.  And then they did the wordplay thing with the, what's a, we, we know, sir.  We don't, we don't think it's a real virus.  It's not a virus, it's Joe!  We know that. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, we know.  We get it.  We wouldn't wake up early to come to a virus every day.  He's desperately trying to find some dishonesty.  Like, like, aha, I got you guys too!  But we're not pretending that it's not a show, despite what the message boards say.  Yeah, we're trying.  Oh, come on, Dan.  What's in here?  What's this?  What's this and this?  Ooh, surprises.  Always good to have surprises in the CD player.  Well, we're doing our own show, and I don't like these CDs in here. 
[02:45:30]  Oh.  Give me this.  Goodness gracious.  Uh-huh.  Oh, I like this one.  Save that one.  All right.  Uh, we got lovely, lovely girls outside the studio.  Lovely girls.  Lovely girls.  Yeah.  Uh.  Let's, oh, where's Jimmy?  This was for Jimmy.  Jimmy!  Hey!  It's disgusting something.  All right.  Getting back to the animation contest really fast. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  I know there are people out there that are very excited about this contest.  It's going to, I'm telling you, this is going to be a biggie for the radio show.  Certainly is.  All I ask, I've got to say it again, all we ask is that if you're doing an animation,  you know, don't put it on the internet, excuse me, don't put it on message boards.  We want it to be a nice surprise for the people that go to the-  You've got to be fucking fresh.  Right.  Yeah, right.  You want it fresh.  Right.  Right.  They don't, you know, we want it to be, yeah, exactly, very fresh and get a natural first-time reaction. 
[02:46:30]  Let me get through this brain freeze.  Hold on.  Oh, that's a cold smoothie.  Oh, that's the worst, right?  Oh, what a pain.  I know, that's really weird.  That's nice.  It's like, people-  I feel like fucking Maury in the front seat of the car.  Gonna get some Danish Rebell.  Yeah.  You know, by the way, speaking of Maury, that's Maxwell.  That's who he looks like.  You Maury's wigs.  You look like fucking Maury from Goodfellas.  You fucking nerd.  Oh, you fucking nerd.  Hey, the pets are coming up with good stuff, too. 
[02:47:00]  Eric F. from Buffalo writes, put a Benjamin Bornstein as a Fatty Pig Fatty sign in front of his office.  Oh, please, yes.  Oh, that would be terrific.  All right.  And people saying, just say the word.  We already said the word.  Yes, please.  Attack is on.  Pests, have fun.  Yeah, so the animations, if you're doing one, you know, you're going to have to send them in to us because we're going to choose like the 20 or 30 that we played during the festival.  Yeah.  And I think Jimmy came up with a great idea.  We're going to play some of the best ones that we've received before this contest as well as kind of a warm up. 
[02:47:30]  And then we're going to debut all the new ones.  Big contest, bragging rights, lots of prize money.  We'll have more details.  But don't spread your animations around if you're thinking of entering the contest, okay?  That's all we ask.  I think we're going to set a date very soon.  Hopefully in mid-April is when the festival is going to go down.  Yes, Jimmy?  I can't stop thinking of fucking Maury and Benjamin Bornstein.  That's going to please me for the rest of the month.  He just looks just like him, yeah.  He really does. 
[02:48:00]  He should be strangled with a phone cord.  His fucking weight falls off.  Jump in the pools, you fat fuck.  You unfunny colostomy.  Fucking.  Here we go.  Just for you, Jimmy.  Please hold.  I have a very important message for you.  Oh, cool.  Hello?  Yes?  Can I please speak to Brenda?  Brenda Burton, please?  She's not here right now.  May I take a message?  There's really no message.  Are you her husband?  Yes.  Mr. B***, my name is Stacy.  I'm calling from GE Card Services. 
[02:48:30]  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  I'm great.  Good.  I'm calling in regards to the Petrie's account, the MasterCard, the J*** MasterCard.  Yeah?  I'm showing due for a payment of $344.  That's a total due on the account.  And I was calling to see when a payment's going to be made on the account.  Ooh.  I haven't had one on here since the 20th of November.  Yeah, and I took that one out this past weekend when my old lady was, she was all laid  up sick.  I maxed it out at the t*** bar, at the massage parlor.  Man, I don't know. 
[02:49:00]  When's payment due on that?  Due on the 17th of every month.  How much is...  Oh my God.  I just realized we have a lot of new listeners.  Yeah.  I guess this is not us.  Yes.  Please make that clear.  Maybe I should explain this ahead of time.  Wow.  Yeah, this is Maxwell.  This is a phony bit about a credit card.  And, you know, being a rock star, he maxed his credit card out at a t*** bar.  Wow.  That's fucking wild.  You cornball. 
[02:49:30]  That is wild.  Boo!  Why don't you be honest?  I maxed it out, fucking shoveling Fudgy the Whale cake into myself until I shit standing  up.  Why don't you be honest?  That's what you did, Maury from Goodfellas Face.  You fucking ugly cunt with a fake name.  You ate.  That's what you maxed out your credit card.  That f***.  Every month.  How much is...  How much is due?  $344. 
[02:50:00]  Well, you know...  Try to sleep.  Money's been kind of tight lately.  Hey, you guys want one?  Of course I do.  What was that?  What?  Here, man.  I got a 20 here.  Oh, no, man.  I already got one.  Thanks.  Figured that out.  How much is that again?  Oh, my God.  Are you Mr... 
[02:50:30]  Are you Brenda's husband?  Yeah, last time I checked.  Hold on.  That's the reaction your audience is having to this kid.  Fucking dozing lock.  You're going to do it.  Is that Stansbury, the guy that's 10 pounds per pound?  I can't tell which two bags.  Hold on.  I got to do a dumber.  You're not doing coke.  Do you think that's funny?  I mean, do you honestly think that that's funny?  No.  Money's been real tight.  I...  Do you honestly know that that's sick? 
[02:51:00]  That is not funny whatsoever?  You want to know what's funny, you dumb ass?  Is that you called a radio station?  Oh, good Lord.  And snore.  Oh, good Lord. 
[02:51:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  Oh, my God.  This can't be happening, man.  This isn't happening.  You fucking pseudo-edgy.  Oh, that was...  Let me see if I could find the words to describe it. 
[02:52:00]  A bucket of shit.  No, here's what it was.  Take a little tin rusting bucket full of shit  and just carry it around and you'll have that.  You should catch a fucking ice pick to the back of the neck  on the way to the diner.  That's what you should do.  Why don't you buy a joke book for Bell while you're at it,  you fucking unfunny hillbillies.  Oh, my God, are they awful.  Oh, that's fucking awful. 
[02:52:30]  Jimmy, I need those jokes.  I need those jokes, Jimmy.  By the way, dumb white guy from Oregon, he writes,  O&A, they're so small, maybe I should stop listening  all the way out here in Oregon.  Yeah, thanks.  Then he goes, where's Cleveland again?  Oh, unbelievable.  Just to have a little fun here.  Okay, you take a map of...  Well, at this point, we have to take a map of all of North America.  Cleveland included, obviously.  Right.  All the way down to part of Mexico. 
[02:53:00]  Okay.  Our radio career, circle the entire thing I just said.  Yeah.  On a world map.  Now, circle...  Well, you want to use...  Part of Cleveland.  Yeah.  Part of Cleveland.  Benny.  That's the difference.  And they're saying that we're not doing well.  Well, here's the thing with Benjamin Bornstein.  He's never been a funny guy, so he wants to be a rock star.  He has an unfortunately unamusing guy with him. 
[02:53:30]  That was your idea of an edgy...  That's the best you could do with that credit card call?  Yeah.  Hey, you dumbass.  You called a radio station.  We need some inspirational music for this next phone call.  Something that builds.  Something that builds.  What do we got?  Never wanted to be a bit, Derek.  What do we got?  We need something that builds.  Something that just gets people excited.  How about taps? 
[02:54:00]  Think running movie.  Oh, right.  The theme from...  Think Rocky.  Oh, I thought you meant the other running movie.  No, I know, but I gave another example.  What's a running movie?  Yeah, this will work.  I have the tiger.  This will work.  We go to Mongo the trucker.  Mongo, what do you got for the show?  Gentlemen, I believe cockpicks are in order.  Cockpicks.  Cockpicks.  Cockpicks. 
[02:54:30]  We don't have...  Cockpicks.  We need an email.  Oh, they'll find the emails.  The pests will find the emails.  Cockpictures.  Cockpictures.  That's right.  And cockpictures.  They'll love them.  And forward them to us.  Yeah, they made it.  Did you hear?  And send stuff to Elo for old time's sake.  Just a couple, though.  Not funny.  Cockpictures for everyone that works at that radio station.  I am the tiger. 
[02:55:00]  Turn it up.  God, let's fucking...  I like it.  I like it.  Luke in Wyoming.  Luke.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Love you.  Love the show.  Thank you, Luke.  I just want to say, you guys need to make more people mad.  This is great radio.  I mean, you just roll on people.  This is what I want to do to guys in the office all day, and I get to sit here and listen to you.  Oh, and by the way, you must not be doing well.  I'm listening to you in Wyoming. 
[02:55:30]  Thank you, sir.  I'm sorry that you have to hear this in Wyoming.  And it's not even about...  That sucks.  Charities of Fire, of course.  It's not even about being bigger than Maxwell or being more famous.  That's irrelevant.  The bottom line is, this guy, we had never heard of him, just started shit-talking us.  So it's like, what are we going to do, not respond?  Yeah.  When someone shit-talked me for no reason, I just want to continually brutalize them.  I could do this all day.  I'm a negative guy, Maxwell.  Benjamin Bornstein attacks you.  You're the one with the fucking faggity name and the chocable Maury face. 
[02:56:00]  Maury's wigs don't come off.  Fucking asshole.  Remember Roller Girl?  She's back.  Erin from Cleveland.  Hey, yeah, sorry.  I needed to fix a...  I don't know.  I didn't want to make up a story.  He was a guest announcer that stayed for three minutes, not a halftime show.  Okay.  I didn't want you screwing that up.  Thank you, Erin, for screwing that up.  Whatever he does, he did it poorly.  All right.  We got very bored girls outside the studio.  Why are they here? 
[02:56:30]  I don't know.  Can we get a mic on them?  Huh?  No, we don't.  Oh.  We don't want a break.  Steve's insistent.  Why is Steve insisting?  Well, F Steve.  Well...  Give me a microphone out there.  Well, maybe there's a reason.  Steve might have...  There might be a technical reason.  I don't think there's a reason.  I'm uploading Foundry.  My song has to be on iTunes.  That's right.  It's called Pendulum.  It swings both ways, like I do.  Than is going out there to make contact with the pretty women. 
[02:57:00]  What's the story?  Are you on?  No, you're not on.  Hold on.  Why would he be?  I try to go on.  Hello.  Hi.  Ask the pretty girls why they're here.  Ask them nicely.  Who's your spokesperson, pretty girls?  Oh, no.  You'll come in.  They just want to know why you're here.  Wait.  Who's the spokesperson?  We want to come in and see you.  Yeah.  I can't see you guys.  We're promoting our new show on Ripe TV. 
[02:57:30]  Ripe TV?  Ripe TV.  Ripe TV.  Ripe TV.  Can we come in and see you?  Do you guys get naked?  No.  We'll be right with you, then.  It's kind of like a doctor's office.  We've got to decide which.  No.  Bring them in and discuss it.  All right.  We're going to discuss your TV show.  Can't just be all about nakedness.  I took it off.  I thought you were done.  Not done.  We have to break, and then we'll get them in.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  Anything else, ladies?  How are we supposed to flirt from this far away?  Yeah, what's up with that?  Come on, man.  Flirting without nudity sucks.  Without nudity.  Yeah.  How it sucks a big you-know-what.  We'll show you a little crack if we can come in.  Fair enough.  A little crack.  A little crack?  Is that all right, Jimmy?  Just a little crack.  Well, we've got our negotiator here, Jim Norton.  Jimmy, is that okay?  Where's Jimmy?  Or do you want a little more?  Jimmy, where are you?  I'm right here, madam.  We can't see you because we're outside, by the way.  That's all right.  You're missing nothing. 
[02:58:30]  I'm mediocre at best.  A little crack is fine.  At least you're honest.  Yes, I am.  Oh, is this going to suck?  I don't know.  They may be fine.  Let's find out about their show on Ripe TV.  A bunch of hot chicks.  What do you think the show?  You think the show's going to be-  I don't know.  Steve, why do we have to break?  I don't know.  I just like them.  I don't want to stay down here.  Okay.  Are we in trouble?  No.  Why?  Why?  Let me see why we have to break.  Let me read something.  All right.  I got to piss anyway, so. 
[02:59:00]  Why don't we just break?  I was hoping we'd break.  I think we're in-  Stop, Sam.  Knock it off.  Ooh.  We have a sponsor that needs to be played before 10 o'clock?  Okay.  Fair enough.  What?  What's what?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Secrecy.  Yeah.  What is this, Steve?  All right.  Steve is writing more.  Top secret communiques.  Okay.  What does it say? 
[02:59:30]  All right.  What does it say?  Jesus.  He's still writing.  Will-  I can't read your handwriting.  Don't bark it out.  All right.  I won't bark it out.  Bark it out.  Will would like to speak to you about the girls.  That's not-  I wasn't supposed to read that.  What?  What's wrong?  Nothing's wrong.  Get on mic.  Why is that-  Why couldn't we say that on the air? 
[03:00:00]  He just said get on mic, dude.  I don't give a shit what he said.  Okay.  Why are you sweating profusely?  I'm not sweating profusely.  I was asked by Will if he could speak to me.  Is he sweating, Jimmy?  Because I got a friggin' lamp blaring and blaring.  Wow.  You're a little nervous.  What's up?  What's the matter?  I'm playing a comedian.  Oh, my God.  What's the matter?  Will asked me politely if he could talk to you guys before we brought the girls in.  Ah, he doesn't want us trashing them.  I get it.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  We understand our sponsors. 
[03:00:30]  We'll just take-  We didn't know they were a sponsor.  We'll just take subtle hits.  Well, you didn't know they were a sponsor.  We'll take subtle shots.  It'll go right over their head.  Don't worry about it.  They'll be happy.  We'll be happy.  The listeners will be happy.  Watch what we do next.  Why can't we just be nice to the girls?  All right.  We'll be nice to the girls.  Why can't we just be nice to them?  I know.  Just be nice.  We're going to be nice to the girls.  Let's just be nice to them.  All right.  We'll do that.  Watch how nice we can be to girls next.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm throwing up some gang signs.  Come on.  Come on.  Do it.  Do it with me. 
[03:01:00]  West side.  West side.  Come on.  Pulling down some dead presidents, yo.  West side.  West side.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Got to jump in real fast.  We've got girls from Ripe TV coming in in a few minutes.  They can't hear us right now.  They're getting a talking to.  They're really, really hot. 
[03:01:30]  We've got like six monitors in the studio.  Two, four, five, six.  We're going to play horrific videos on the screens as we do just a regular interview with them.  Like Meat Spin, Lemon Party, Two Girls, One Cup.  Two Girls, One Cup.  Poop Party.  Yeah.  And other horrific videos.  Horrible.  I think the more shit.  Amputee porn has to go on there.  The more shit videos, the better.  Yeah.  That's right.  And puking.  The harder my dick gets, the angrier they'll get.  And we're not even going to make them look up at the screen.  We're going to hope that they start looking around.  And if they look up just slightly, they're going to see horrific shit going on above their heads. 
[03:02:00]  And hopefully we'll get some kind of reaction.  Can we put them on these monitors?  So every single monitor in the room?  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  And we're going to.  No, not these.  No, not these, though, because we're going to make believe.  Really?  Well, these in front of us.  Okay.  Well, where are they going to be?  They're going to be way over there on the couch.  They're going to see them around them.  Oh, okay.  You can put them up over here so we know what they were looking at.  Okay.  You can put them on those screens.  Yeah.  But if you put them on these, then they're going to go, look, those screens, you see it  right there.  We got to make believe.  Okay.  What are you talking about?  Okay.  We're going to try it and see if it works. 
[03:02:30]  Before we get the girls in, we did the Peeping Tom story from earlier.  Yes.  And one of the listeners, always getting good ideas from the listeners, they suggested that  we play the old bleep game.  Ah.  BME Olympics, yes.  Also amputee porn.  So the boys took the story and threw some bleeps in this.  Listen to this.  A woman gets the shock of her life when she finds that she's living below a f***ing  n***er.  The man is accused of f***ing her through a hole that he drilled into her bathroom. 
[03:03:00]  Looking forward to Hank Winchester is live in Romulus right now.  And Hank, how did this woman spot the hole?  Well, Ruth, when you see the hole, you'll agree it is hard to miss.  Take a live look behind me here.  You can see the victim lives on the first floor.  The accused f***er right upstairs.  The only thing separating those two apartments is a little plywood.  Hey, good suggestion from one of the fine listeners of the Opie and Anthony show.  Also, Finger Slam and Mother Man need to be in the mix.  I'm being tubed. 
[03:03:30]  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, we got hot chicks.  Let's bring in the girls.  Bring in the girls.  Bring in the beautiful girls.  Beautiful girls.  Come on in, girly.  Which camera should we use for this?  Oh, camera one.  Leave your pocketbooks outside, please.  Go for camera one.  No one's going to steal them.  And preferably take your coats off so we can see something.  Thank you.

And I wasn't even eating like a pig.  Right.  And I gained 40.  Very cool.  How old is that tattoo?  Not that old.  It comes really close to your vagina.  Yes.  It does.  It looks cute, though.  Didn't it hurt?  Not so much.  I used to date a girl, and she had a tattoo on her lips.  On the lips?  Whoa.  It seems like very uncomfortable.  It seems uncomfortable.  It's uncomfortable, and then to get it done is probably uncomfortable.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, be sitting there with your legs spread.  I don't know why she did.  It was a really weird tattoo.  Actually, it was a penis.  It was a penis?

We got the news on, so we're well informed.  I don't know what you're looking at.  Someone's shaking it in the butt.  This is really nasty.  Around, around, around.  And it looks like gay porn.  It's gay porn.  What are you talking?  Look at our TVs.  We got MSNBC on.  We got NBC.  You guys are pervs.  Meat spin. 
[03:11:30]  They watch gay porn.  We're not watching gay porn.  We're talking to the beautiful girls.  Don't lie.  So I guess you're not turned on by all of us.  We love you.  Yeah, we absolutely love you.  You're that certain equipment piece you need.  Oh, my God.  Okay, equipment piece.  So you're on the show called The Ripe Seven?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  How is that chick behind the guy?  What?  I think it's a transgressions.  Oh, my God.  What are you guys talking about?  The Ripe Seven.  Yeah, The Ripe Seven.  That's not right.  Our show comes out this spring. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  It's just going to be us going around.  We're traveling, doing charity events.  Red carpet.  Red carpet.  Sporting events.  We're going to be everywhere.  Being crazy.  So we're the face of Ripe.  But, okay, no, Ripe TV is the, is the, is the, is the, uh, the website that you're on.  It's the website, yeah.  Oh, it's not a television.  It's a, no.  It's on demand.  Time Warner and Comcast Cable.  Yeah.  Ripe TV dot com and on demand.  Right.  And then on your mobile device.  Hey, for the people, uh, uh, Ripe TV dot com, what do they see on that website?  You know, and over.  Hot girls.  Hot girls. 
[03:12:30]  A lot of hot girls.  A lot of hot girls.  A lot of hot stuff.  Car stuff.  Yeah.  Funny shows.  Midgets?  Yes.  Good.  Midgets.  Midgets always good.  There is midgets.  What else?  What are you going to do that's weird?  Or crazy?  What are you going to do that's crazy?  You'll just have to watch and see.  Well, no, you got to tell us something.  It's almost like, that's like, they don't, they don't, they don't just preview a movie and  go, it's action packed.  And then just give you the title.  They show you a little bit.  Well, there's all kinds of shows on Ripe.  They have a model dating show with Jamie Kennedy.  Models.  Models at 10 a.m.?  Models before 10 a.m. 
[03:13:00]  Uh-huh.  Some beautiful models rolling around in a bed.  I think any guy would love to see that.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you all right?  Yeah, I got to.  You guys do what you got to do.  I just got to call my front desk in my building.  Are you sure you're not watching porn again?  We're not watching.  Look, look at our TVs.  This is what we're watching.  We're watching MSNBC and some, some lady, some kind of commercial.  So what are we promoting today?  I didn't, I wasn't even listening.  Our new TV show.  Our new show.  All right, your new show.  Ripe TV. 
[03:13:30]  Ripe TV.  Basically, seven girls going out having a ton of fun and they're going to film it.  And obviously, you know, when girls drink, like, we have fun.  So obviously it's going to be seven hot girls.  Seven hot girls.  Hot girls.  Hot girls.  Getting crazy.  Getting crazy.  All around the country.  Nudity.  Almost nudity.  And Ripe will be taping us.  A little nudity.  Boy shorts.  I would imagine.  Cleavage.  What are we looking at?  Huh?  She doesn't even want to be here.  Who?  What's the problem?  The one in the coat.  Yes, I do.  The one in the coat.  There's so many of us.  I'm giving, everyone has a chance to talk.  We all want to be here. 
[03:14:00]  I'll just hog the mic.  Thank you.  Yeah.  She looks like the mic hog.  So you're going to check us out?  Yeah.  We like Ripe TV.  Our own Sam and Than have done stuff for Ripe TV.  They don't look as hot as you guys, but they've done some stuff.  Put them in a bikini.  They'll be just fine.  You think?  All right, Jimmy.  We're talking about Ripe TV here.  Ripe TV?  Yeah.  Cool.  Do you watch Ripe TV?  I do not.  No.  Well, you're going to now, right?  But I want to know what stuff you guys are going to do.  Do you have to?  I mean, the internet's a very tough place to compete, especially when everybody is 
[03:14:30]  clothed, because it's obvious you can get whatever you want on the net.  So what are you going to do that makes it different and makes people want to go there?  Well, it's all shows based for guys.  Boring.  Whatever.  Racing.  Midgets, like you said.  Hot girls.  Okay.  And it's a cable network, so you can get it on TV, too.  I do a show called TNA for Ripe TV.  TNA?  TNA, and I give love advice with another girl in my underwear in a bed.  It's pretty hot.  Well, what kind of love advice would you give? 
[03:15:00]  Give us an example.  I'm probably not very good love advice, but I give it anyway.  Guys call in or email.  All right.  Give us some advice.  There's a lot of guys listening.  Some love advice to the guys.  You ask me a question.  They write in with questions, or they call us.  You really want us to ask you a question?  What type of question do you have, Jimmy?  Well, I don't necessarily have any, because I do an advice show as well.  So what I'm saying is it would be kind of cool to do one together.  Yeah.  I think that would be fun.  A question, I guess, that a lot of guys ask us to try to figure out when we have beautiful  girls on, how do you get the balloon knot? 
[03:15:30]  How what?  How do you get to the balloon knot?  What's that?  What?  You know, the...  What Gregorio is saying is, a lot of times, the balloon knot is kind of a way, a lot  of guys that want to go out with girls, we have regular sex, we have oral sex, but other  times you want the taboo form of sex.  Right.  You're not.  Go get a prostitute.  For anal sex?  Yeah.  Go get a prostitute.  No way.  Get some Valium.  All right.  Hold on.  We got different points.  All right. 
[03:16:00]  Let's go down the line, Iraq.  Hot girls.  Coffee says hooker.  All right.  Hooker.  Definitely hooker.  I think it is.  Sex in the back door.  Thumbs up, thumbs down.  Let's go from left to right.  If it's done right.  All right.  We got it done right.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Now we're on to something.  I concur with that.  Wait.  Miss Maxim says, all right.  I like that.  What does done right mean?  Yeah.  What is done right?  This is good advice.  It's got to be done right.  And then it's really good.  Yeah.  Really slow. 
[03:16:30]  Whammed in.  You got to ease your way into it.  Right.  How do you think about the distraction method?  The distraction method.  Like you go look over there.  And when they look, you just do it real quick.  Yeah.  It's kind of like taking medicine you don't want to take.  Yeah.  That is so great.  That's it.  It's like a tap tap.  Are you guys?  Are you guys?  Then they're like, forget it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That was coming at the same time.  Hold on.  Because Iraq's not paying attention.  Why would he?  He's thinking about lunch.  Oh, poor sweetie.  What were you saying?  Not her, Iraq. 
[03:17:00]  That one.  What?  He's still not listening.  Put some fucking headphones on.  When you do the sneak attack like that, then they're pissed.  And then they're like, no.  So you're not a fan of the oopsie?  Oopsie, no.  No oopsies, right?  No.  And then when the girl yells, ah, what are you doing?  Oh, come on.  I'm already here.  Don't be silly.  Yeah, right.  Then they're pissed off by that point, though.  So what kind of advice do you give?  No, no.  Jimmy, let's go down the line.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We'll get to you again.  We're not going to get any other advice.  Hold on.  We're on to something here.  All right.  We got a if done.  Hold on.  We got a if done right.  Let's move on to the next lovely blonde. 
[03:17:30]  I agree.  If done right.  If done right.  So you like it?  If done right.  Who's done it wrong?  Lots and lots and lots.  Lots and lots.  Hey.  We got a goer.  I'm kidding.  I'm saying general.  Most guys do it wrong.  What do they do wrong?  I'm not saying I slept with lots of guys.  I'm not saying that.  All right.  What do they do wrong, though?  I turned this blonde.  Wait.  Now, how many guys have tried to do it in the butt, but they've done it incorrectly?  Yeah.  I'm not.  What?  How many guys have tried to have anal sex incorrectly? 
[03:18:00]  Because men are too brutal sometimes.  I'm just saying, like, the vast majority of men, like, speaking in general, probably do  it incorrectly.  Yeah.  Right.  I'm, like...  But you're talking from...  Hold on.  You're talking from experience.  So what have they done?  What?  What did they do wrong?  She's trying to backtrack.  She was ready to fucking go in alphabetical order.  Yeah.  So what exactly did they do?  Yeah.  What was the one thing he did?  Tammy explained it.  She's just assuming, because most guys are, like, wham, bam, thinking, ma'am, let's get  this done, and real quick, and not thinking about anything.  Oh, yeah.  We got an Xbox to get back to. 
[03:18:30]  So she's just assuming, you know?  All right.  So...  That's exactly right.  All right.  Let's move on, Iraq, to the next...  Coffee says get a prostitute.  You're not going there.  You can knock.  The door is not open.  I'm good.  How about a pinky?  Yeah.  How about a...  I don't want anything.  How about one nut?  I'm good with that.  One knuckle of the pinky.  I'm good.  Would a guy like a pinky?  Yes.  Yeah.  And I'm not wondering either.  I'm good.  I'm a pinky cough.  I'm good.  So, um...  Let's talk cough.  Let's get down and press fast.  A guy would like a pinky.  Yeah.  I'm telling you. 
[03:19:00]  That's what you got to learn to do.  You're still the pinky in.  Well, you've been watching gay porn, I think.  No, you've been watching gay porn.  I don't know what you're talking about.  No, it's not a gay thing.  I don't want a penis.  I'm just a little bit of a pinky.  Okay.  Well, I'm not your girl then.  A little bit of a pinky.  I'm sorry.  What's the wildest thing you do, coffee?  What was that?  What's the wildest thing you do then?  Because that's pretty wild, the back door.  What do you do?  It's for me and my partner.  Like, I'm pretty wild.  I like positions, different areas, different meaning places, not areas on my body, first 
[03:19:30]  of all.  All right.  What's a weird place?  He's got an attitude.  I like it.  Um, while he's driving.  You like to give him hummers while he's driving?  No.  I like, just use your imagination, Jimmy.  What are you doing while you're-  Wait, you have intercourse while driving?  That's all I'm going to say.  How the fuck do you do that?  Keep going.  No, no, no.  We have to go.  Prostitute for anal sex with me.  But meanwhile, she'll endanger the lives of everyone on the highway. 
[03:20:00]  I just say it has to be on the highway.  Well, where else would you do it?  But how do you do it?  Like, are you both facing the road?  No.  You're facing him.  All right.  I'm just asking.  Yeah, you're straddling him.  Wow.  You've never done that?  No.  But you've had the pinky, you said.  Oh, I've had more than a pinky.  I've had a pointer finger, but I don't like-  No, when I'm driving, it's too nerve-wracking.  You need to try that one day, Jimmy.  I couldn't keep an erection driving.  It'll be too nerve-wracking.  I think you'd definitely be happy.  It would frighten me.  All right, let's go on to the next one. 
[03:20:30]  And she's the one that was on MTV and gave birth.  Yeah, I'm totally down for it.  And has a nice stomach.  It's done right as well.  I am?  Yeah, for sure.  Do you have a fella?  Maybe you should have stuck to that.  I think it might have been better.  And the pinky's fine, too.  Really?  The pinky's actually better.  I mean, because I think you have to save the back door for just special occasions.  You know?  Can't be on a regular basis.  It's like a third date.  I love her.  There you go.  Take it back, please.  Special occasions.  Pinky, you can do it on a more regular basis.  Very cool. 
[03:21:00]  She's lovely.  Save that for a Sunday morning.  You're like the fucking completely dirty one in this group, aren't you?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's obvious.  She's the completely filthy one in this group.  Just because you're just nice, but you're a mom, and you get that little dirty tattoo.  You're like the fucking...  Yeah, dirty tattoo.  You're the trooper.  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, it's pretty obvious.  All right, let's move on.  Dani?  No, not for me.  Next.  No anal?  No.  And let it be known, it's the girl in the coat.  See?  She doesn't want to participate. 
[03:21:30]  No, I just don't want to talk about sex stuff.  Move your fatness, Iraq.  Hold on.  No, hold on.  Let me say something about that, though.  Oh, that's Dani.  I'm sorry.  Dani?  Yeah, thanks.  Talk about sex stuff, but you're on a website that does, in a way, promote...  Sexiness.  Sexuality.  So it's like asking a sex question is a logical progression because you're all very beautiful.  They didn't accidentally pick beautiful girls.  They picked because of the sexual feeling people get.  Right.  So it's a logical way to go.  Yeah, but you don't have to talk about sex.  What are we going to ask about, though?  Of course.  What do you want to talk about? 
[03:22:00]  I don't have to answer.  What should we...  What should we...  What should we ask about?  You guys can ask...  No, no, I'm asking you.  Next girl.  All right.  What should we ask you about?  She makes love.  No.  Drive seven comes out this spring.  This is kind of like a...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Jimmy...  No, no, that's not right.  We're not trying to get too deep into your personal life.  This is a very legitimate question, and you're coming off like we're being dicks or whatever.  No, I'm not coming off like that at all.  I don't think you guys are being dicks.  You know when you get like a plate of oysters, there's always like a bad one you got to throw 
[03:22:30]  it back.  Let's...  You could...  We'll have her sit out in the bleachers.  And we'll continue with the oysters.  You guys are bullies.  Not bullies.  We've been very...  You're bullies.  Very private.  Were you picked on in school?  Were you picked on in school, and that's why you're being mean to her now?  I'm always being mean to her.  Yes.  I'm calling her out on something that she's saying.  She's got her coat on, and she doesn't want to participate, so she can sit on the bleachers.  Don't pick on her.  We like the right TV.  We're the right seven, and we stick up for our girls.  That's fine, but the right seven has to be honest. 
[03:23:00]  The right seven.  How come there's no fat-like seven girls?  Well, there's seven of us and two of you, so you guys want to do this?  There's three here.  You just decided not to talk.  I've just been using the camera to get you in compromising positions.  You want to do this?  We can throw down right now.  Sexy, but we can fight.  Right, but you want to be beautiful.  We've got Kara's back.  You should have her back.  Good for you, but she's not.  You're being a bully.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Why would you do that?  Jimmy, she doesn't want to talk about sex.  No, she didn't say that.  Yes, she did.  No, she didn't say that.  She just doesn't want to talk about sex. 
[03:23:30]  No, Erin, don't look at sex.  I'll talk about sex.  Ew, now FYI listeners, they're watching Two Girls, One Cup.  No.  No, this is not Two Girls, One Cup.  It's similar.  It's similar.  What are you talking about?  Look.  That's what Opie and Anthony watched during the day.  MSNBC is going to interview with Kinky Friedman.  I don't know what you're watching.  Oh, my God.  Right now, next to Erin.  And just so you know, Tara, the girl who didn't want to talk about sex, you were playmate 
[03:24:00]  of the year in 2006.  Yes.  So it's not crazy that we would ask you about your sex.  Yeah, why would you guys have jerked off to you?  I don't think it's crazy.  I choose not to talk about my sex.  Did you talk about it in your bio for the, they ask you about sex a little bit, right?  They don't ask you about it on your bio at all in the magazine?  It's not about, like, sex stuff.  What do they ask you about?  And your data sheet.  Oh, my God.  Excuse me, you guys.  I can't handle this crazy.  I'm going to, like, I'm seriously getting nauseous.  What are you talking about?  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  God. 
[03:24:30]  Artie Lang is hungry.  That's what it looked like.  You okay?  What?  We're supposed to go eat right after this.  Wow.  Ew.  These questions are not.  I kind of like it.  Don't talk about it.  All right.  Why don't we, hopefully.  These questions are not that bad.  Hopefully, we only have one bad oyster.  Let's move on.  Danny.  Go ahead, Darren.  Do you want to ask the question, or is everyone clear on the question?  Yeah, it was just about, like, he was joking about the balloon.  We were just trying to go down the line saying anal sex. 
[03:25:00]  And some of the girls said yes, and if it's done right.  And some said no.  And some are like, no.  All the religious questions.  I think it's just something that you would keep between you and your boyfriend.  And if you're really into someone, I think that if you're comfortable with that, it probably  feels better.  Well, yeah, because you're relaxed.  I don't think it's something you'd ever do with a stranger.  Like, ever.  I don't think sex with a stranger is necessarily great, either.  So, that's just me.  So, have you done it?  No comment.  Oh, come on. 
[03:25:30]  I'm happy you haven't.  I've done it with very few girls.  I'm not a fan.  Well, my answer was pretty, like, splinter.  Well, no comment means she has.  Yeah, it's hard.  I just think that, you know, I just would keep that between, I don't know, myself and  God, unfortunately.  That's nice.  You look up to the Lord and say, keep this between us, God.  He's always watching.  That's not the type.  When they talk about a connection to a higher power, they don't mean that you keep the  ass-bucking between you and him.  But honestly, I do.  I do.  This video is horrible.  Keep this under your head, Christ.  All right.  All right.  And finally.  Finally.  It's Kelsey's turn.  Yeah.  Oh, no. 
[03:26:00]  It's a horrible question.  Yeah.  I'm an exit-only girl.  Sorry, boys.  That's not your thing.  Not my thing.  I'm not saying I haven't tried it.  It's not my thing, though.  So, it's no deal for you.  No deal.  No deal.  No deal.  I'm not saying steal or no deal, girl.  But you have tried it.  Right.  Okay.  But obviously, he didn't do it right, because you'd like it.  If it was done right.  I totally agree.  That's awful.  But honestly, like, okay, here's another thing.  She's 21.  She's only 21.  And...  Tammy, damn it. 
[03:26:30]  It has nothing to do with a bad idea.  That has something to do with it, I think.  How old are you?  I'm going to be 30.  So, I think the older you get, the more, like...  Baby, I'm almost 33.  And I'm not, I'm married, too.  So, you kind of try more things, especially when you're married, because it gets bored.  So, basically, she's saying you're inexperienced.  And a rookie goes up.  Making me angry, kind of.  Because it has nothing to do with the fact that I like it or dislike it.  It's the fact that I personally think it's, like, dirty.  And I don't want to risk getting something because it feels good. 
[03:27:00]  It has nothing to do with whether I like it or not.  It's a health reason why I don't like it.  Are you resentful because she was saying that you're...  No, but you said you didn't like it.  So, I'm saying it probably wasn't done right.  That's why.  I don't want to argue with you.  I'm on your team.  Yeah, but you know what, Joe?  I'm on your team, honey.  Not to get involved in your business, but she kind of feels like you kind of called her out.  You're saying that she was kind of young and inexperienced.  No, I didn't say she's inexperienced. 
[03:27:30]  That's what she's thinking.  I did not say that.  Is that what you heard?  I just...  It seemed like that.  It doesn't matter, but I still love you, Tammy.  No, I wouldn't say that.  No, because when I was 21, I wasn't down with that.  You know?  I was married.  So, then when you're married and you're with someone for a long time, then you're like,  okay, let's try something new to spice up the bedroom a little bit.  Right.  You're inexperienced.  Basically, what she's saying is you come into your own sexually, and by 21, you just haven't  yet.  That's all. 
[03:28:00]  Don't you think?  You guys don't know anything about my sex life?  Women peak?  Oh, yeah.  Years later, we're going to come back.  Oh, my gosh.  I mean, it's absolutely it.  Years later, we'll be back.  Wait until I try to.  I already said I did.  You did?  What's wrong with these girls?  You're going to fucking piss me out.  What's wrong with them?  Oh, my gosh.  I'm dying.  I can't even look at it.  It's the most disturbing thing ever.  It was a huge deal.  Yes, all on the series.  They're killing me right now. 
[03:28:30]  In my 33 years of life, I've never seen shit that awful.  It's taboo.  How do we have sex?  Like, can't we go back to our show?  The Ripe Seven, please check us out.  We're hot girls.  Seven girls.  I can't even take it anymore.  It doesn't matter.  The handler's begging us to stop.  Okay, guys.  We're going to just take over.  Check us out on Ripe Seven.  Ripe Seven.  Ripe Seven this spring.  RipeTV.com.  Check us out. 
[03:29:00]  On a band on Time Warner.  Don't regret it.  Come play with us.  These guys, I think we're done playing with them.  These guys are dirty.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Have you been watching these screens?  No.  What are you doing?  What the hell is so funny?  Oh, my God.  Seriously, you guys are crazy. 
[03:29:30]  We're done.  We're out.  Peace out.  RipeTV.com.  Check us out this spring.  What just fell down?  Isn't that mine?  She's still with us, see?  We got one that's still with us.  Oh, shit.  You can come back.  Here, let the other.  Yeah, of course.  Let the dullards leave.  You can come back.  Oh, she's great.  What's your name?  We're going to.  Tiffany.  Tiffany.  We're going to remember Tiffany.  Tiffany, you come back any time.  We lost six out of seven.  We lost seven. 
[03:30:00]  I have never seen such heinous videos.  The one with the guy with the four dildos up his ass and his asshole hanging open.  I forgot my dad.  She's just a goatee man.  Get a mic out there.  Get a mic out there.  Oh, is that fucking funny.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Take it easy.  B-Rock, get a mic out there.  Oh.  Where?  You're showing open like half a week.  No.  On me.  Yeah.  That's not even good in here. 
[03:30:30]  That's not even good in here.  Not exactly good breakfast to bear.  Yeah, exactly.  But please don't say I mean, look, this is not a guy show.  Oh, no, I don't mind.  I need the conversation.  Okay.  I don't even want my video anymore.  I need to call later.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:31:00]  Should we help you with this?  Hang on, babe.  Okay.  Oh, that's a great model diet.  A great model diet.  Get a stick.  A great model diet.  We're taking all your waters.  Get them out of my face.  What was the last one?  Thank you.  Pink sock?  That last one.  It was a guy pink sock.  It was a guy pink sock.  We lost them.  They're out.  They're out.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Dude, I don't even know if that's funny for the radio, but my God, that's one of the funniest  things ever. 
[03:31:30]  Because the videos just got more and more gross.  They were losing their minds.  It was disgusting.  They got disgusted and then pissed off.  And the one girl was trying to leave quickly and fell down because she started tripping  over everything.  Then we got them to fight amongst themselves after this.  They were talking about this unity.  Yeah.  The thing was this, man.  That type of shit drives me nuts.  It's like you posed in Playboy, but you're keeping your jacked.  Just get the fuck out.  I'm sorry.  I said it.  No, I know you did.  You're right. 
[03:32:00]  I said she was the bad oyster that you get.  But it's like you want to kill oysters.  Here's what bugs me about that shit.  It's like you're promoting something because of your sexuality.  Your sexuality is what's getting people to watch, which is cool.  But don't be completely prudish when we're asking you a few personal questions.  It's like you want people to look at you and find you sexy.  That was a very valid question.  Where's Will?  Will's right there.  Will!  Goddamn, is that funny.  How much cleaning up are you going to have to do?  Fuck him.  In other words, there's no ever cleaning that up. 
[03:32:30]  Hey, they were fucking horrendous.  Except the one girl was really cool.  Tiffany, let's remember Tiffany.  Tiffany was very nice.  She really liked us.  But the rest of them are too used to MTV shit.  And it's like, you know what?  Fuck you, man.  Stop trying to be sexy if you're not going to cough up information.  The one girl that was freaking out about the questions with the reddish hair, when she  walked out, she was visibly shaking.  Oh, I know.  Like she was just a quiver.  Her eyes were all watered.  Well, she's part of Deal or No Deal.  She's like, fuck.  But we weren't even being mean to them.  We were just being silly.  The one girl had the attitude, I'm sorry.  She had a coat on the whole time, and then she didn't want to even have some kind of... 
[03:33:00]  Playmate of the year.  Right.  Yeah, really.  Real sexy.  You know how many batches of jizz have been spilled because of that?  Two in this room.  I thought we were pretty well behaved, quite frankly.  Yep.  Just showing some porn accidentally.  Some gaping ass.  Oh, my God, dude.  No harm?  The gaping ass was having me laughing so hard.  The best part is, like, you've seen this horrific video, and you're like, please look  up, please look up, and then they would look up, and just all hell would break loose.  The handler's face.  I hope that...  Oh, I know. 
[03:33:30]  ...some of that was captured.  Yeah, that was hysterical.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's a real fun show.  You can see the girls really are real playful.  That's what you want to see, seven girls just giggling at their own adorableness.  Enjoy the show, folks.  Jeremy S. from Cleveland, a regular, he writes, they left the studio quicker than from a great  white concert.  That's funny.  That was so fucking funny when that gaping ass was on.  One girl looked up, and then in horror, she turned her head like she was going to get  whiplash, and covered her eyes. 
[03:34:00]  The girl was really freaked out about the shitting on the face, too.  Yeah.  She was just like, she's like, that's just not right.  That is just wrong, wrong, wrong.  That was fucking hilarious.  There was one clip, it looks just like Artie Lang, and he's getting puked into his mouth.  Let's go to Mike the Trucker.  Mike.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I've been listening to you guys for two years, and I've listened to you blow up some interviews,  and this is the greatest of all time.  You guys are the best.  Thank you, sir. 
[03:34:30]  Later.  That was one for the ages, because it was just so fucking funny what was popping up on that  screen.  See, all they want to do is just come in and expect the fact that they're hot to sell something.  First of all, it's radio.  There was one guy on all four sucking a tranny cock and getting another tranny cock up his  ass.  Wow.  Where can I see that?  Lucky Devil.com.  He was very hungry for everything.  And these girls are like, just horrified.  Yeah.  Horrified.  I'm looking forward to the phone call with the CEO later. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, that could be a problem.  Yeah, I explained to the CEO that I'm sure that it's a really cool channel, but it's  like, if you send these girls in.  Right TV, man.  You know what?  If you like that segment, do us a favor.  Just pop on Right TV for a minute or two and get their hits up or whatever.  Get their hits up.  Or whatever you have to do.  Perfect.  Yeah, let the CEO know.  Let's save Will's client, because...  We won't lose a client.  Will believes in us, so we shouldn't blow up his spot.  He left YSP for this shit.  What are you going to do with YSP now?  Well, I mean, exactly.  All right, thanks, boys. 
[03:35:30]  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Money's money.  Oh, my God.  That was too funny.  Did we explain everything just to totally paint the picture?  Then Jimmy had those two fucking fighting right after they said they're all together as  one.  I was trying to hang on.  The black girl coffee was ready to scratch my eyes out.  Yeah, she hated you.  She was fucking pissed.  She couldn't stand you.  And then the other ones looked like they were just getting drunk from the videos.  They were so horrified by the videos that were playing, I couldn't stop laughing. 
[03:36:00]  And once I saw on Anthony's screen, because I didn't want to look up, it's too obvious  above us, and I saw the fucking guy ass cave was just opening his asshole.  That's the one I had to do.  Because for the people that were on Pal Talk, I switched from the girls to the video screen  so that they could at least get a line on what the girls were looking at.  And that's when they really just started laughing their asses off.  The one guy who opened up his asshole pretty much sat on the equivalent of a fire hydrant. 
[03:36:30]  It was huge.  That was the knockout punch.  That was the knockout punch.  Because it was after he had pulled it out and he was gaping.  It just opened.  And they were going by so quickly.  Oh yeah, what a montage.  That was nice.  I gotta remember that.  Send a slideshow to Grandma.  That's very funny.  I enjoyed that.  I enjoyed that. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, me too, man.  God damn it.  Fucking Playboy Playmate.  And then keeps her jacket on and wants to play that shy routine.  I saw her the whole time.  I watch these people when they're sitting out there.  They keep throwing out your plugs.  I knew she was going to be a problem.  But I had an open mind.  But soon as she came in.  She was the one that was walking in with the pocketbook.  Like, leave it outside, honey.  Oh, God damn.  Phew.  That was good.  Someone's saying they sucked.  They didn't suck.  That did not suck. 
[03:37:30]  I gotta defend this radio show.  That was hilarious.  I think he's saying the girls sucked for not playing along.  Oh, let's go to...  And they did, because we weren't being brutal.  It was just an anal sex question.  What are you, that timid?  You're sexy.  You're running around.  Right.  Your whole thing is how hot you are.  But when it comes down to the brass tacks,  you're too shy to admit if you've had anal?  Yes or no?  So what?  Or at least come up with something clever instead of, like,  making it obvious that you're...  The one girl who did the advice show was fun.  Yeah, she'll be back.  She was great.  Tiffany.  Let's remember Tiffany. 
[03:38:00]  Tiffany Lynn.  Let's say hi to Rich in Jersey.  Rich?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I got to tell you, I hate those broads.  When they're so prudish, they come off like they're hot to trot.  And then, man, you guys set them up.  Hot to trot.  Perfect.  23 Skidoo.  Crazy.  Hot to trot.  Hey, I've been listening a long time with you guys.  And it really hits home when you hear that kind of bullshit.  Yep.  Love it.  Thank you.  The Colugia sisters.  Hot to trot. 
[03:38:30]  I love this guy.  Hey, she's hot to trot, cunning ham.  She really thinks who the fuck she is, don't she?  Like Ace.  Fucking Pesci should be fucking putting your head in the lap.  Thinks who the fuck he is.  Tom for Philly.  The lines are coming in now because I'm not sure what was heard.  Tom writes, I think everyone missed Opie's line when the girl said she was 30 years old.  And he said, oh my God.  I know.  Oh, is that nasty?  And then someone else heard the variation of the C word.  Oh, well, yeah. 
[03:39:00]  For a certain person on the couch, it was changed slightly.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Wow.  Eli, Jersey.  Bravo on getting those videos up.  Yep.  Very good.  Who is that, Than?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Good job.  Thank you.  And you said my name wrong.  Wait, what are we doing?  I said that was Than that got the videos up and running like that, even after a serious  computer crash.  Dude, well, that has to be explained, too.  It ruined the whole bit.  We came up with this great idea, and the fucking system froze.  We're like, now we have to actually stall and ask him some stuff. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, that's when it got really bad, because we were trying to get the cameras or the TVs  back up.  Thank God the listeners hung in there to the end, because now I know what we do.  We're going to cut that up and get rid of all the dead spaces.  And then when we play this over and over again for the next five years, people are  going to go, remember when they were on XM?  They were so much better.  They suck now.  Like we're assuming we'll have jobs in five years.  Jesus Christ.  CB radio.  CB. 
[03:40:00]  It's coming back.  Eli, did you say what you wanted to say?  I don't even remember.  No, I didn't.  Oh, okay.  That started off as the biggest train wreck.  It was absolutely unbearable.  We were listening to it on Pal Talk, and it was like, ah, boring.  And my Lord, that turned out to be some of the best radio I've heard ever.  Ever.  Look at that, Maxwell.  Ever.  Not funny.  Not funny.  This is Benjamin Bornstein, the actor that, oh wait, no, I don't say that. 
[03:40:30]  I don't tell my real name.  Not funny.  Eric and Austin.  Yes.  Maybe Jimmy should write an apology letter.  Linger.  I would like to.  Let's see how the sponsor reacts.  Yeah, we might have to come up with a policy letter for the gaping.  How do you write that one?  How do you write that?  Dear kids.  Kids.  Yes.  I don't remember this.  This is coming up a lot.  David in Kansas, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Good evening.  This reminds me of that bitch that came in when Patrice was in there, the girl from the 
[03:41:00]  lingerie bowl.  I wasn't here, but he called her a cunt.  He didn't see her to be here.  Hey, thank you.  I'm getting some props today, which is very nice, because I didn't think half the shit  was heard.  Opie had the best line.  Yeah, you don't give anal up right away.  You save that for, like, the third date.  God, those chicks.  Oh, this is really funny, too. 
[03:41:30]  Yes.  Hunter in Canada.  I thought this, too.  Go ahead, Hunter.  I like how that one bitch says, attention, listeners, Opie and Ashley are watching gay  porn.  Like, we're going to get all scared and go, we're not going to listen to this show anymore.  That is perfect.  It's like our listeners don't know we're faggots.  Yeah, they're basically saying, yeah, tell us something I don't know.  Whoa.  Quick break, and then we'll do line of the day.  What's that guy doing up there?  All right.  I don't know, Jimmy.  Wow.  I don't know.  Something stupid.  He's walking so high up in the air.  He's going to hurt himself.  Uh, let's, uh, let's take a break. 
[03:42:00]  Um, what's he doing?  He's too high up.  We took enough praise for how great we are in the last five, ten minutes.  Going to the phones usually means we just want you guys to compliment us, and you did  fine with that today.  Thank you.  Tearing down another wall.  We used to do that a lot.  We were the biggest losers at NEW.  We would do, like, a five-minute bit that we knew was great, and then we'd go to the  phones casually, like, oh.  Hey, what do you have to talk about today?  That was the funniest thing.  Really?  Like, I didn't see that written on the screen before I took this phone call, but thank you, 
[03:42:30]  sir.  We used to do a lot of that.  But we were better back then.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  B-double-O-B  There's a lovely young lady showing her breasts 
[03:43:00]  Boop  Boop  Boops  Make it  Chuck them  Girls all over the country flashing their lovely boobs  Guess how many boobs nights are in  Can?  I don't have those  You are spectacular  Bow near  Bow near  Wednesday  Wednesday  A-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bl-a-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bkins 
[03:43:30]  Ah, settling down.  Still talking about what just happened.  Where's Sam?  Sam was videotaping that whole thing.  We're hoping that...  Sam, you think we got some reaction videos?  You think we got some we can maybe pop up on a website that brings that whole bit together? 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, I was filming their faces the whole time.  As they're looking at the horrific videos?  Yeah, like mid-sentence when they would just stop and go, what the hell is that?  And then I also hid behind the water cooler thing and tried to film them while they were leaving.  Nice.  Do they enjoy themselves?  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah, they enjoy themselves all right.  Hopefully you can make something out of that because people want to see that.  Also, we got Sam's wrestling promo, but we're going to have to do that tomorrow, Sam, okay?  Sam...  He's almost got something.  By the way, the reach for the headphones that stupid just made, and then the okay... 
[03:44:30]  Okay, like that's what I knew was going to happen.  We're going to push these headphones away.  He's just pushing them away.  Look how ready he's getting.  Oh, he fucking...  He was fucking ready to sit down and put his feet up.  Those are those lights that Steve was talking about.  Oh, I got you.  Can you remind us tomorrow to do this?  Because you're part of the...  That's deflection.  Are you officially part of the NYSWF?  Yes, I am.  What is the NYSWF?  The New York State Wrestling Federation? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He says it like, whoa, you mean that?  You should have known.  He's doing wrestling promos.  Is he?  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw something on Google.  I had a Google alert.  I'm like, oh, let's see what this is.  It's all about Sam.  Sam and his wrestling career.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  So we'll get the reaction shots.  Oh, is he ready to sit down and fucking chat up a storm?  Oh, God.  This is a note that came in.  Pull up a chair.  Note that came in because the publicist or whatever, the handler of those girls was freaking 
[03:45:30]  out.  Oh, no.  And it was handed to me, girls have to be out at 10.40, 10.45.  She was just like, oh, please.  And then she looked at me with this look in her eyes like, please.  I just looked like...  Don't kill them.  I just ignored her look of her plea for help.  Good.  Hey, Ant's prom thing.  Oh, well.
