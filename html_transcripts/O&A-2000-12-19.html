<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Opie recounting his string of unfortunate car troubles, including exploding Firestone tires, a faulty cruise control, and a broken hood latch.  A caller, Karen, shared similar woes with her Ford Explorer, prompting a discussion on faulty products and the inconvenience of recalls.  Another caller, Bill, then detailed his own mechanical nightmares with a Mercedes, leading to a comedic bit with exaggerated complaints and inappropriate Nazi references.  The show then transitioned to “Old Dirty Anthony,” who launched into a vulgar tirade about the Olympic swimming events and female athletes, followed by profane commentary on the Knicks and Patrick Ewing.

The show then featured 19-year-old Corinne in the studio.  A sexually suggestive game, "What's in My Pants," involved Corinne rubbing a microphone on her genitals while the hosts guessed the object (a "wood floor"). This segment involved explicit descriptions, visual elements via a webcam, and numerous obscene comments from the hosts and callers, with Corinne participating in sexually charged acts and responding to increasingly outrageous prompts. Cowbell Bill also participated in this portion.  Following this, the hosts shared their negative opinions of the Universal Studios tour, with a former tour guide contributing anecdotes and exaggerated lines from the tour.  The show then briefly touched upon the song "Who Let the Mets Out."

The next segment focused on O.J. Simpson, detailing an *Enquirer* article about his erratic behavior with a new girlfriend, Christy Prade.  The hosts discussed Prade's claims of Simpson's confession-like retellings of the murders, stalking, blaming Nicole, and insistence on abortion.  Humorous Simpson impersonations and a series of his alleged prank 911 calls, involving bizarre claims and a drug dealer named Pedro Guerrero, were played on-air.  The show then transitioned to a contest where mothers could win NSYNC tickets by performing outrageous acts. A caller, "Gay Marco," offered oral sex for the tickets, leading to an explicit conversation and a deal with a woman, Kristen, to receive oral sex in exchange for backstage passes to meet a specific band member. The show concluded with a caller's increasingly absurd attempts to reach station employee Carol Miller, resulting in a series of misconnections.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony's Year in Review, 1-0-2-7-N-W-N-E-W.  I like, I like, I like, small boys.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You are officially out of control, agree?  1-0-2-7-N-E-W.  Oh my God.  You hear it?  Does anybody hear you? 
[00:00:30]  When did you sneak into the studio?  I brought you a bottle of champagne.  For what?  You know that you wanted Patrick Ewing to be out of here.  Ah, look at that. Anthony rules, man.  I don't care what you say about him.  By the way, I need a car tonight, too.  My truck is still, um, is still laid up.  Because I took it in for the tires, Opie.  You know my exploding Firestone tires on my SUV? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, exploding Firestone tires.  Yeah, all of a sudden, the guy that's, uh, he runs a check on the vehicle, whatever.  He goes, oh, there's a couple other recalls that have popped up that I just forgot about or didn't get the notice on.  The cruise control cable tends to stick, that makes the throttle stick, even when the cruise control is off.  Thank you, Mercury.  Also, the hood latch.  That's been recalled, too.  And, of course, the exploding tires. 
[00:01:30]  So, theoretically, I could be driving down the West Side Highway.  The throttle will stick, the hood will flop open, and my tires will explode.  And it'll just be a fabulous day for everyone involved.  That could be a cool new contest.  Yeah.  And my wiper motor doesn't work, my driver's side door lock, and, of course, I'm not under warranty anymore.  And were you like me, though, when I had my blazer, when these recalls came in the mail?  I just threw them away.  Yeah, I really don't care.  There's like a new recall every other month. 
[00:02:00]  It's like, ah, whatever.  What are the odds that could happen to me?  Unless you get a letter that says, we have a recall, instead of an airbag, we put, like, a spike in your steering column.  So, if you hit something, a big spike will come out and stab you in the head.  And even then, I'd be like, I can feel we're not hitting it.  I might not hit something.  You know, oh, the seats, we've made the seat filling out of a nitroglycerin.  Right.  So, if you hit a bump, it could just explode, and you'll be up all right.  Well, no, and I don't even get to drive, I'll miss the bump.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't even get past that point. 
[00:02:30]  You know, when it says recall, and then you have to read to figure out what's going on.  Yeah.  Like, for exploding tires, it should say recall, and just in huge letters, exploding tires.  Right.  But if it's like stupid windshield wiper might whatever.  Yeah, it's like, ooh, the wiper might not work.  Right.  In the rain.  Don't bother me.  I can deal with that.  It's working now.  Who cares?  Exactly.  Right.  But exploding tires.  Exploding tires.  It should be right on the envelope.  Recall, exploding tires, open now.  No, no, they didn't want to even word it that way, the recall. 
[00:03:00]  And I never got a recall notice for my exploding tires, mind you.  I just heard about it on the news.  And all the numbers came out.  I can't win an effing lotto.  I buy lotto tickets.  I play that god effing crack in the bars that, what is it called?  Quick draw.  Quick draw.  I can't hit worth a crap.  But I sure hit on those tires when I took the numbers out to my truck and looked at it.  Ooh, winner!  I even got the bonus number.  They just explode in park.  I can't win a lotto, though. 
[00:03:30]  Too funny.  Yeah, so they're still working on it, Anthony.  So if you could hook me up.  Thank you.  Karen, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Good.  Anthony, I wanted to talk to you about the recall on your car.  Yes.  One of the many.  One of the many recalls.  Yes, I'm a lucky owner of a Ford Explorer and got all the same recalls that you did.  And let me tell you, you can't win for losing with that company.  Oh, my God.  It's a joke.  How the hell do you put out a vehicle, or anything for that matter, that doesn't work? 
[00:04:00]  They're broken.  They're selling you broken goods.  And then these recall things are just patchwork.  Well, it's ridiculous.  They're not locked.  The acronym Ford is just a pair daily.  The Explorer was our first that we ever owned.  Well, this is everything.  They try to get these. 
[00:04:30]  It happens with everything.  With cars, they try to get the new models done, designed, built, and out there before  the competition does.  So they put out inferior goods.  It happens with cars.  It happened.  Remember that game I got yesterday, Opie?  Crimson Skies.  What's the problem with that?  Microsoft's new game.  You already have a problem with it?  Well, when I got home and loaded it onto my computer, it was crashing my computer every  time I tried to play it.  So I go to their website, their official website, nothing. 
[00:05:00]  I go to the fan sites.  There are a list of message boards complaining that this is the buggiest program of a game  that has been out yet.  They get it out there because they have to get it out and sell it quickly to make their  money back.  So they put out a game that isn't done.  It's buggy.  It hasn't been debugged.  And then they say, well, in a couple of weeks, we'll have a patch for you.  A patch.  All these games that they put out now that are buggy, you know that they're putting out 
[00:05:30]  an inferior game and that in weeks to come, you're going to have to download patches.  So it was crashing my computer.  I couldn't even play the God effing thing.  Did you set it back yet?  No.  I'll wait for the patch.  I'm an idiot.  But you know something?  For somebody that doesn't make a lot of money, that goes out and spends 50 bucks on these  games, you want to play the goddamn thing.  You don't want to sit and wait for a patch.  Microsoft, suck ass.  Suck ass.  And it's inconvenient enough to get a notice from a company saying that they have a recall 
[00:06:00]  on a cruise control or a door latch or something like that.  And how many times are you going to bring it in?  It's more possible to fix it.  How many times do you have to bring in this goddamn truck?  When these companies announce a recall on a truck or a car, they should show up at your  goddamn house and fix it.  Fix it at my house.  You're absolutely right.  Because I have to take off two days without his vehicle.  Two days without my truck and if I would have brought it in as the recalls came in, this  would have been the fourth time I would have had to bring my truck in and leave it there 
[00:06:30]  for God knows how long.  I just happened to blow the recalls off and now they're doing it all at once.  Well, we should have announced something was wrong because the day after we drove it off  the lot, we used the back windshield wiper for the first time and the thing flew off  the car.  Thank you.  And we had to bring the car back to the company for that.  Well, my rear windshield wiper doesn't work.  They have to fix that.  My driver's side door lock, well, I unlock the car door.  Every other lock goes up except my driver's door.  So now I have to open the back door and reach over and grab it like I'm driving a 56 Rambler. 
[00:07:00]  You know?  What is this?  The General Lee?  I got to jump through the window?  Yee-haw, boss hog.  Well, at this point, we're hoping that the tires explode because we just need to be put  out of our misery with dealing with this car.  Yeah, I think the lucky ones are the ones that died.  I'm just kidding.  They want to make it a hassle to bring the car in because they don't want to lose all that  goddamn money to fix your car.  Firestone's blaming Ford.  Ford's blaming Firestone. 
[00:07:30]  They're all in cahoots.  F them all.  I'm going to get a bicycle.  We didn't recover to fix anything with it.  We had the hose for the windshield wiper fluid came undone.  So every time we put windshield wiper fluid in it, it would just drain right out the bottom  of the car.  So we get it fixed.  They fill it up.  They said, no problem.  I'm in the parking lot.  I'm putting all the paperwork in the glove compartment.  And I go to use the windshield wiper fluid, and there's nothing in there.  It drained all on again.  And the hose came right off like it had done before. 
[00:08:00]  And I drove it back around into the service entrance.  And they told me I had to make another appointment and leave my car for another three hours to  get it fixed.  Right.  You know, and it's like, you know, you just got a mouth like an outboard motor all the time.  You have better luck with yours.  All right.  Thank you, Karen.  You know what the bottom line is?  If you've got these Firestone tires on your Fords, yes, you're screwed. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just drive into the service center like you're some kind of Hezbollah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Just drive into the side of the service center.  Oh, no.  You're about to go postal on one of those service centers.  It's not me.  It's going to be someone else in tune.  All right, Karen.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Someone's got to recall her jaw.  It keeps running even after you try to shut it off.  Bill, you're next on WNEW. 
[00:09:00]  What's happening, guys?  Hey, man.  I bought one of those 98 ML320 Mercedes.  A Mercedes?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Which you would assume would run well.  The day I drove it out of the...  Wait, wait.  Do you have a Mercedes?  Yeah.  That's not true.  Yeah, you're listening to us with a Mercedes.  They say our listeners don't drive Mercedes.  We're just stealing.  Well, let's not discuss that.  All right.  So what happened?  I drove it out of the lot the following day.  It's a rainy day.  I got a push.  You know, they have the automatic push down on the window.  Window won't go up.  Would not go up. 
[00:09:30]  That's great.  Brand new.  Pouring rain out of the lot.  A recall?  No.  Two years later, it's happened four times over the last two years.  Starters had to be replaced six times.  Six separate times.  They put out inferior goods just to get it out there.  Well, they built a car in Alabama.  I would love to know what a Mercedes recall notice would look like.  A wedding invitation, you know?  So you are cordially invited to bring your car to a service center.  We have a bit of a problem with the ignition. 
[00:10:00]  That was another problem I had.  Yeah.  I drove it in front of the door of the dealership, locked it, took the keys, and had my wife drive me home, and I left it there.  And the service centers are just tailed by all this, so they're not giving you the best service.  No.  No.  No.  And then what they did is if you had Mercedes, they tell you to call Mercedes, like the corporation, because each office...  What is your problem?  Exactly.  ...with Mercedes did not put out inferior goods? 
[00:10:30]  That's what the guy sounded like.  Of course.  They're all a bunch of reformed Nazis.  They tell you if you have a problem with the service department, you call Mercedes, and they'll straighten it out.  I'm sorry, we were only following orders.  We put in the ignition wrong because we were told to.  Where are the panzers?  They are supposed to be at Normandy.  Anyway.  Guy loses his effing mind on the phone.  I cannot wait to Führer.  He is the only one that can release the panzers. 
[00:11:00]  We have to get the panzers to Normandy.  Yeah.  Well, basically.  So, it's an ongoing...  I sympathize.  I'm just waiting to find out that the tires are going to fall off the damn thing.  The poor guy.  You're driving your Mercedes-Benz 60.  Bites of cyanide.  It's about divisor.  They didn't tell you that's what's there.  That's great.  All right, guys.  Guys, rock.  But it's a recall, right? 
[00:11:30]  Hello?  Who is this?  Yep.  Bring it in next week.  Yeah?  Something with a drive train?  Really?  There are some happy, happy Mercedes people right there at the last sales meeting.  All right, Joe.  Later, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right, we've got to take a quick break. 
[00:12:00]  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  What did you learn on the show today?  Uh, really, not too much there.  It's not anything beautiful, anyway.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned absolutely nothing.  I actually lost brain cells today.  What did you learn on the show today?  What I learned today, this bit still sucks.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027.

[01:30:00]  something very very wrong with us  flip a little intrusion to the delinquency of a minor  the opie and the anthony show  it's really bad but it's really good  there was an article in the paper today  hollywood just freaking out because they see what's going on with napster  and uh you know everyone burning their own cds and stuff  they don't want the same thing to happen with dvd  oh it'll happen once uh  i guess there's i guess there's what uh this code on the dvds or something  and uh there's supposedly programs out there or websites that you can go to and figure out how to get rid of the coding 
[01:30:30]  yeah and you can you can download full movies off the internet it's kind of uh it sucks now because uh the bandwidth problems it's hard to transfer that much information it's just not as easy as you know doing the music thing right  but music was almost impossible just uh a year ago music was yeah maybe six months ago  they're coming up with the new ways to compress this stuff and and get it across and before you know it  sure real-time movies will just you know you'll you'll do what you do on maps do you hop on a site 
[01:31:00]  you pop in an actor or a movie title or director or something  and uh all these choices of movies will come up you punch down on it  and there it is yeah you burn it to a disc you pop it in your dvd player  and there you are watching a movie at home it who does that screw everyone  blockbuster hollywood f them all  f them all i loved it speaking of movies you got a nice little present today from steve c  yes gotta thank steve c from foundrymusic.com 
[01:31:30]  the jaws dvd i heard you guys talking about that the other day so i figured i'd do it  i watched it last night  eyes rolled back  i was laughing because they were doing the whole autopsy on the on the dock scene  this is oh oh yeah let it do it this is amazing because i i got the speech  pretty close but ants got it word for damn word of the mayor yeah do the mayor of the mayor  look fellas let's be reasonable this is not the time nor place to perform some kind of a half-assed  autopsy on a fish and i will not stand by while you cut that thing open and watch that little 
[01:32:00]  kittener boy spill out all over the dock  little kittener boy that's that's good i want them strung up by their buster browns  he's the best the mayor's the best yeah and then the great we might have to get some mayor clips  from jaws yeah we should i i love when uh when uh the mayor finally realizes that there is a shark  problem and brody gets him to sign the paper and he's just in the hospital 
[01:32:30]  he's all screwed up and everything he's just wandering around i can't wait to see this i'm  going to definitely watch this it was uh it was cool it was definitely cool and and what do they  got on here uh besides uh making of there's like an hour long the making that was a lot of fun it  was show you how antiquated that old shark was yeah mechanical no digital enhancement there it just  shows you because we all of the movies that are being released now have these elaborate digital 
[01:33:00]  effects and this thing was this huge rubber shark on uh yeah it was a huge machine on this huge metal  pulley contraption they had yeah and it would sink every time they put it in the water it didn't work  for like the first three months of production you know and i was watching jaws last night and i was  looking really close to the shark god for for when when did that come out 75 right you did a damn  good job it doesn't it still holds up to the test of time that damn shark huh the little video game 
[01:33:30]  doesn't though no no remember that the little kid playing the video game yeah no dark attack or  something and a little cartoon shark the making of it is really interesting you know the shark cage  yeah you know that that was a midget in there yeah they put a midget in the shark cage  did you know that ahead of time i had no idea australia yeah and uh yeah so that way the sharks  that were swimming by would look bigger just what they would look just absolutely he was saying hooper  so hooper ain't you watching it 
[01:34:00]  now i want those little tight happy bastards caught and hung up by their busker brown  i love that guy we gotta we gotta get the uh the mayor drops for our radio show that's our latest  project it's just swimming with bow-legged women don't drink that all right city ends i'm cutting  money all your life so and you'll enjoy that jaws dvd it's right up your alley yes you want to talk 
[01:34:30]  about the jaws exhibit at universal and how lame is the the universal studios tour jaws thing the whole  tour no the whole tour blows yeah you get on these trams if you've never done this i think everyone's  done it at some point in their life if you've ever been to california or what's even worse than the  california one at least the california one i think they actually used some of the sets i don't even  believe that the the like the car like the car from back to the future yeah yeah yeah that's that 
[01:35:00]  no that that obviously isn't the one that was oh yeah that's the blues brothers car yeah yeah i believe  that on the universal lot they did have leave it to beaver's house right in california now i think  steve do you know anything about that the uh universal i took that tour actually last october  in california or or florida california okay and i i think a lot of those sets are legit  are were used or sure they got like the facade from you know psycho yeah yeah they got the little  motels down below and stuff it's not like these whole full-blown houses no we know that the front 
[01:35:30]  oh and boy the tram driver doesn't uh let you forget that these of course are called facades as we  drive around the back of the house you'll notice that oh look no walls i guess june cleaver couldn't  get dressed in here which means false front facade and now the jaws exhibit look and here we are in 
[01:36:00]  the lovely uh town of amity there it is and look there's uh the fisherman out there you catch anything  oh my god what's happened to him his boat turned over and he didn't even move his legs didn't flare or  nothing he just turned right over still holding his fishing pole then he got sucked into the water  oh my god oh and we're heading right for him in our tram gee we're really scared because you can see  jaws head you see the charge heads right under the surface of the water not moving so that big machine 
[01:36:30]  behind them pushes them right towards our tram those of you that you left might want to get your cameras  ready for this very spontaneous opportunity it wasn't even working the day we went no the  tram just kind of drove by the limp jaws just sitting there out of the water it's like oh great now we're  turning down new york street which is an exact replica of new york city yeah yeah not even close exact 
[01:37:00]  replica we're the nigerian yeah yeah yeah yeah the funny thing is rick was one of the tour guides at  universal studios he used to do that do you remember any fun lines uh yeah okay here i got to hear the  real some of the real how many times a day did you have to do this five times a day five times a day  basically once an hour 25 times a week all the rooms loaded on the tram  let's hear okay let me get let me get in the mood yeah all right i'm screaming in the tram universal 
[01:37:30]  studios i've been in a hot line for like two hours waiting with screaming kids and i'm finally on the  tram and here's rick to entertain us and what kind of fun cast your mind we're in california okay we're in  california come on come on rick you remember you remember yeah take that off so it's more like it was  all right all right welcome aboard to universal studios hollywood super tramp presented by texaco 
[01:38:00]  are you sick  he's running like texaco is it  universal studios toy guide i'm your toy guide rick did you say that come on give it to us  i love it i know i wasn't a tour guide it was a studio guide ah okay i'm going to be your studio 
[01:38:30]  guide and bob here's your driver here's the horn bob i'm so excited to be here this is great i got my  camera ready i want to hear everything our studio guide rick has to say so don't be talking i got my  my disposable camera ready and i'm on i want to see the psycho house i'm i'm on my honeymoon  what what when we come up through five points texas you'll notice that the doors on one side of the  street appear to be larger than the doors on the other side of the street why is that one that's 
[01:39:00]  because back in the 20s and 30s when they were making a lot of westerns some of the actors weren't  as tall as they should have been and of course if you ever see one fly through one of those windows  don't worry because they can pick it up and eat it because those windows are made with sugar 
[01:39:30]  do we have the bus sound over there somewhere where's the bus sound rick i gotta get the whole  thing i'm almost feeling it like i was there this is amazing that he remembers that i'm starting to  flashback yeah i remember the whole thing it's horrible horrible all right let's let's pull away  now from the uh western street here we go ah in our little train as we pull away from 526 
[01:40:00]  don't laugh we'll be coming up on a small town you might know as amity  now the music would start right yeah then we have  we would have a we would have a little thing with a soundtrack so you can play different music  for different sections right yeah right so you go through amity and we see bob hey bob how's the  fishing today uh-oh there goes bob that's it oh the chains are going to eat this up 
[01:40:30]  they'll snap and they get all of us gone well as we make our way around we'll let somebody know that  bob's having a problem oh what was that the shark comes up and starts like chomping at the side of  the right water yeah i remember that but then it's real believable when jaws backs up yeah yeah you look  behind you you see jaws backing up into his original position now what about maybe the uh the battle star 
[01:41:00]  galactica portion do they have that the little tunnel yeah what else do you remember oh the tunnel oh  the tunnel yeah actually we more or less talked about it as it was yeah you might remember this  tunnel from the six million dollar man when he ran after bigfoot and you know that wasn't the tunnel  they used it's been on that damn tram ride and then the um king kong the king kong part right they had  uh the earthquake yeah with the uh wasn't that with king kong the whole king kong was on there too 
[01:41:30]  it you come into the studio they open up the doors and then uh it closes behind you now we're in new  york tell us about the the flood that comes down the uh uh uh yeah the hillside and then the water  opens up from uh the ten command that that well the flood is earthquake right right all right so we pull  into uh age 54 i think yes which was a uh two-story stage one of the only one of its kind 
[01:42:00]  are you stoned mr uh died man you're laughing an awful lot my my young uh son here is saying you're  stoned well don't worry heroki this thing will get very very interesting in a minute okay as you see  they've been doing some filming here that's why you see some of the sets that have been set up and  that was that was always a line of crap too yeah they want they would never film on the tram line 
[01:42:30]  would they um that's retarded actually no they did do uh filming for like the work what was the  beverly hills cop 3 yeah the real bad one yeah oh you see like the battle star galactica yeah because it  was supposed to be on the tour so of course it was going to be filmed up but none of the none of them  actually i remember the first time i was on it they go and look running in the background that's  rock hudson for his joe mcmillan and wife like what fancy crap there's peter faulk yeah filming 
[01:43:00]  colombo here at universal so now we're in the uh when the earthquake stage yes and that's when uh  the doors close you know this is where we're doing some filming today what was that oh that that was  just a little rumble those are those are tremors we get those all the time in california a clever ruse  yeah yeah because then all of a sudden it becomes like this big shaking thing the truck from the  top comes down yes and burst into flames right and then the water comes and it floods it all out 
[01:43:30]  and it's like driver get us the heck out of here the heck because you can't curse wouldn't you just be  like oh my god oh my god holy hell they were telling you you can't do that because some of the people  will actually freak out oh you should have done that ladies gentlemen this isn't fake please get out of the  the tram and run towards the flaming truck that just fell and all the working machinery run for  your life hiroshi that's good jimmy jimmy what's going on how you doing guys we're doing well now i 
[01:44:00]  i've actually done that tram ride myself and it was pretty damn lame i have to say but there was one  piece of that whole thing that made me turn white as a ghost what do you guys remember the bridge  the collapsing bridge let our tour guide run us through the collapsing bridge if you would please  now as we come around to this bridge you'll notice it's one of the oldest bridges here on the  on the universal studios back lot building the 1920s and it looks a little creaky but we're going to 
[01:44:30]  try and speak across right now i remember that okay as we come across and then the trick is to keep  talking like nothing's going on and all of a sudden the bridge drops oh yeah yeah because a couple of  pieces of lumber kind of fall as you're rolling up to it and you get right on it and the bridge kind  of drops a couple of feet it feels like probably like six inches and then you come off and go that's  just part of our falling bridge you may have seen this on the six million dollar man or the bionic  woman remember when she jumped backwards but her hair was going up while she was going down 
[01:45:00]  how do they train you for this man that's what i want to know dude it was an intense four-week course  really four weeks with a book about six inches thick that you had to memorize verbatim all for  five fifteen hours well it's all struggling actors anyway right right they're gonna make their mark  so they could care less who they got because everybody's just like oh my god i'm gonna be working  in a hollywood studio oh hollywood studio you're on the tram tour i'm getting churros for a buck fifty 
[01:45:30]  less than the other guys that's our bungalows how about the bungalows that's bungalow 54. he knows it  all this is where lucille ball i would say while she was getting banged by brenner you should just  lost your mind and just redid the whole thing that would be great that would be hilarious run for  your life people let's see what else was there oh this is a favorite uh-huh the kings love this one 
[01:46:00]  too oh my god if they could understand you oh as we come up this is what is known as um what was it  called it was where they did all the horror movies but i forget the exact name of it yes and it'd be like  right through those walls that's where you know the hunchback of notre dame came walking through and  that's where we first saw dracula and if you look up there right now there's one right now wave to  him everybody it's the invisible van oh that old kid wave wave and then you have everyone to be waving  yeah all the rooms that's the invisible van oh of course you got everybody with the cameras 
[01:46:30]  going where is he where is he click click click click click click did you just want to shoot  people did you want to shoot yourself and shoot myself and then of course we get to anthony's  favorite part of the universal that's where moses parted the red sea yes oh it looked just like it  did in the movie it's like a fountain you drive through it's a freaking fountain it's uh it's it's  pretty pathetic many gallons of water had to be used and pumped out of this did you have to do the 
[01:47:00]  tour during gay day uh rick uh i don't think i had a gay day when i was there at universal no gay  day that's disney look rick feels at home uh talking into his little microphone yeah yeah you  can but the funniest part is can you totally picture rick doing it without a doubt yeah with  a big smile on his face wearing a universal studios uniform with a name tag it's the only time in my life  i read a word and wasn't there a break that you took like where you got out of the tram and went into the  props uh little sound stage and walked through it and then got back on the tram they stopped that 
[01:47:30]  like two years before i got like people pilfering the uh props i remember they would just parade a  bunch of people through these things and like and this you might recognize this uh lion or this jaguar  figure was used in back to the future next to the big clock on the clock actually charge extra for  that now when i was there they have like for 150 dollars a person if they take you to the individual  sets where they're filming the personal tour oh great great anthony yeah yo hey what's going on 
[01:48:00]  guys hey man hey man i thought those guys were pretty damn good except for uh king kong  you thought the jaws ride was good yeah with the gasoline exploding all right  are you insane it doesn't take a lot to entertain you huh anthony no all right man thank you hey send  the case when it's time to get to the radio show that might happen he's good yeah all right thank you  see you buddy later bye jim uh emailing in hey rick hey hey hey hey hey hey hey you're lame 
[01:48:30]  yeah where is my lame clip today uh you get it all right oh this guy dave uh knows the revolving  tunnel lee majors fell into where on line eight line eight let's get eight dave you have information  on the rotating tunnel you remember the tunnel that spun around with the lights inside yeah the  lady told me the girl has given the tour said the lee majors got so disoriented that he couldn't  shoot the whole scene he kept falling down and that's a true story that is hysterical when you're 
[01:49:00]  driving that thing and you start looking it totally flips you over and make you feel like you're uh it  actually you're rolling that was the only part of the whole tour that was actually exciting yeah that  because it did kind of do something to your senses kind of you flip it upside down but the rest of it i  love when they just drive you past their junk and and it's like and this yeah some of these props you  see a plane here that was used in an episode of the six million dollar man for the giant shoe 
[01:49:30]  six million dollar man the giant shoe you might recognize from the incredible shrinking woman  that was uh filmed here on universal studios and right there there's the red ferrari magnum used to  drive and it's just like this piece of crap laying on the side of the road it looks like cardboard  it is not all over it they don't even take care of the prob it is not yeah i think you're lying  did anyone call you a liar um no never get anybody uh rambunctious no pretty boring pretty boring 
[01:50:00]  yeah most of them couldn't speak their language which is funny because most of the people that  couldn't speak the language are the ones who decide to sit right in the first car with you so you're  trying to throw out your best stuff it's your best stuff i'm riffing i'm riffing on the cleaver house  i'm doing the top shelf stuff here right i didn't get anything from you know the little asian family  or the spanish people because they don't understand english you might recognize this is delta house  from uh the movie animal house and right there is 1313 mockingbird lane oh i gotta get a picture and 
[01:50:30]  can you imagine like going home and pulling these pictures out in front of people and this is  the house meanwhile it just looks like you're taking pictures of people's houses it doesn't  look like anything see this house yeah please could you put the goddamn pictures away it's another  thing the the advent of the video camera is just do you ever see people in wherever and you see them  wherever right now right here videotaping and go take the hard rock uh cafe we're right across from the

[01:55:30]  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to Yankee Stadium.  Oh, he's got some formwork in these days.  Welcome to Yankee Stadium.  Bob Shepard.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to Yankee Stadium.  I'm going to cross the street now.  I'm going to cross the street now.  Hey, how about the Mets not crying after they won?  You know, the Yankees being the older team, 
[01:56:00]  I think they're getting a little sentimental in their old age.  Why are they crying and getting them...  It's not like they haven't won a championship before or anything.  What's wrong with Torrey?  Now Torrey's weeping openly.  We got some Torrey clips.  You know what the Yankees are getting like?  I love the Yankees.  Yeah.  But they're getting like the uncle.  Remember the uncle in your family that used to be the young, cool guy  who was with the chicks and everything in his younger days,  let's say maybe the 70s.  And then all of a sudden now, you see him at the holidays,  and he opens up a card, and he's crying at the birthday card. 
[01:56:30]  And it's like, wait a minute.  What happened?  He's crying because he knows he can't get the young things anymore.  He had the big pork chop sideburns.  He's talking about how many chicks you railed.  And now you're weeping over a freaking Hallmark card.  That's what the Yankees are now.  Why is Torrey crying, seriously?  I don't know.  You're more of a Yankees fan than I am.  Maybe he was soused.  I don't know.  I was crying on the Ron and Fez show,  and that was due to my drinking, Opie.  So maybe...  I was confused.  I thought I was in a coma for the last two weeks,  and then I woke up and Torrey just won another World Series. 
[01:57:00]  I'm like, no, it's just a freaking playoff.  Right.  Calm down.  All right, here's Joe Torrey.  You got a kiss from your manager, Joe.  Let me ask you.  Obviously, a very emotional time right now.  We're just talking to Tino about this team being counted out by so many.  What are you feeling right now?  I can't talk.  I'm choked up.  You know, I got so tired of hearing how, you know, we turn it on and off.  This ball club comes to play,  and I don't think there's any ball club that I'm more proud of than this one. 
[01:57:30]  It's not because it's the most recent,  because we ought to go through a lot.  And, you know, we're going to find out how good we are.  But right now, I don't think anything can top what this feeling is.  His voice is cracking.  Okay.  We're getting choked up.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  A little more audio.  Michael, I can't tell you.  I don't think I've been more proud of any other team than this one.  It's been a rollercoaster ride. 
[01:58:00]  And, you know, getting to the postseason wasn't easy.  Sounds like you just won the World Series.  I know.  You know, no feeling is better than this.  No, how about if you win?  When?  I'm sorry.  You know.  Wait, what are you going to do?  He's going to curl up in the fetal position, suck his bum on the mound.  Boom!  We won!  We won!  I've got to give it to your Bobby Jones there.  God damn it.  That was a great job, great job.  That could have been a no-hitter. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  I would say two inches away from a no-hitter.  Perfect game.  Nice to see a pitcher go all the way through the game in a playoff.  Very nice.  Pet it.  Mm-hmm.  I'm like 6-0.  I'm like, ah, this is over.  And then I tune back in the game an hour later.  I'm like, whoa, they're chipping away here.  I say, Juan, shut up.  Well.  Pet it gets that look on his face like a serial killer gives a hooker before he chops the  head off.  Yeah, see how lucky he is?  I'm just looking at the catcher.  Yeah, I could kill you.  I'm going to pull my hat way down and barely see my eyes. 
[01:59:00]  But there's hatred in these.  And then he talks, and he's like, you know, Jesus Christ, my personal relationship with the  Lord.  Right.  Gee, if I didn't have that, I'd be killing people.  Sure.  Who let the dogs out?  Oh, my God.  If I hear that song one more time.  Unbelievable.  Bobby Jones is going, man.  This is a brilliant answer.  Get down.  Unbelievable.  I'm listening to the fan just laughing my balls off.  Bob Murphy's one of the best.  Bob Murphy's good announcers for baseball. 
[01:59:30]  I know he's old, but he sounds like he's drunk and he has a really bad cold.  And he pronounces nine and five like no one does on the face of the earth.  Five.  Five.  Nine.  Nine.  The best.  Nine.  Five.  Two.  What?  Yeah, he is good, though.  Being an old Mets fan, this is great.  Well, that's moving on to the National League Championship Series.  Taking the Giants. 
[02:00:00]  Giants.  He does do that.  Taking the Giants.  That's great.  Nine.  Five.  Nine.  Moving on.  Now against St. Louis.  He was great when he was teamed up with Ralph Kiner and Lindsey Nelson.  Hey, Kiner's, that was stay tuned after the game for Kiner's Corner.  How many beers did that crew have during the game, man?  Remember that?  I mean, Kiner's Corner. 
[02:00:30]  I think Lindsey Nelson was on acid when he was doing the games with the stuff he used to wear.  Those sports coats.  Moving on, both teams, one series away from a Subway Series here in New York.  You don't know how good that is, man.  Yeah.  Rich, what's up?  Yeah, he's got him down great.  I started rolling when I was in my car, but he's got to put the gurgle like he's trying  drowning on his own phlegm.  Yeah, that's what's going on.  They're hanging wild.  Like his teeth. 
[02:01:00]  Unless we're in the Giants, we're loving.  We're young.  Yeah, but he's got like a gurgle in his throat like he's got some phlegm caught in there.  We're young.  That's what's up, man.  Well, we're sticking here with the line.  Four running.  Bobby Jones running one hitter in the game in the line. 
[02:01:30]  Booby line with Kate Lewis.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  That's freaking disgusting.  Hey, Joe, what's up, man?  Yeah, I'm checking in on Murphy.  Yeah, he's like, on Wednesday, it's going to be Hampton.  On Thursday, there's lighter.  Thursday.  Thursday, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, when it says lighter.  Lighter.  How many films?  Well, how lighter.  Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday.  Come on, he's a great announcer.  You guys suck. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm going to play this guy all around.  Disgusting.  Look, I cut it all over my shirt.  It fell in my pocket.  A loogie.  Sorry about that, a loogie.  I've been up early.  I've been up since five.  Five. 
[02:02:30]  You ain't going to sleep until nine.  But this time wide for balls, too.  A little bit back.  I can't believe a word for butt.  Why?  You're the kicker, bro.  Well, it's the best.  I was winning by a boy.  Hey, Sean, what's up?  Oh, man.  Do you ever listen like it could be snowing and anything during the baseball game?  And Bob Murphy here, Frank D for baseball.  Yeah, it's always a beautiful day. 
[02:03:00]  I'm here.  For baseball, temperature about five degrees.  Five degrees below zero.  Hopefully going up to nine as the MetLife Snoopy Blum takes its pictures high above Jesus.  Goddamn, you got a new voice, eh?  That's funny.  There's Bobby Jones going nine, nine innings.  Now, well, we go to St. Louis. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, God.  You're sitting all over the top.  My phlegm is foaming up because now it's ginger ale and not coffee.  Did you know what you could do, Bob?  Let's do that.  Powering high-five, bro.  It's soda.  Eat my ass.  You go far for your art, man.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  You think we're going to get a song?  There it is. 
[02:04:00]  Little book back at the Met.  1986.  Let's go, Met's go.  Hey, there's a girl being raped by the 86 men.  Easy.  Let's go, Met's go.  Ha, ha, ha.  We got the teamwork.  Yeah.

[02:04:30]  Let's go.  What the Mets are doing now is called unconsensual sex.  Hey, you're right.  Oh, Rick.  We make it happen.  We make it happen.  We make it happen.  We make it happen.  We make it happen.  We make it happen.  We make it happen.  Let's go.  There go Daryl Shubber and Keith Hernandez fighting again.  What a close team.  Look at that.

Here's the pick on the way.  It's not a swing.  A cow.  Oh, a mountain of a fly ball.  He's a lifester.  Oh, it is.  Remember that one?  It's on the home run.  We'll be celebrating that with some cocaine and horror.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[02:06:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  There it is.  Ricky Henderson and Bobby Bonilla playing cards.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'll be a singer.  And smoking in the dugout.  We got rid of both of them.  To make the dream work.  Who's that in the disguise?  It's Bobby Valentine.  To make the dream work.  Ha, ha, ha.  To make the dream work.  Let's go, let's go.  Let's go, let's go.  Let's go, let's go.  To make the dream work.  Let's go, let's go. 
[02:06:30]  Bravo.  Let's go, let's go.  Let's go, let's go.  We got the teamwork to make the dream work.  Any radio station playing really stupid Mets songs or Yankee songs yet?  Has anyone heard any yet?  I guess, oh, I'll give them a plug.  I don't care.  A plug.  Z100 is playing Who Let the Mets Out.  This is like their, they must have gotten their crack production team together to wheel out this piece of crap.  If this song doesn't spell gay, I don't know what does, man. 
[02:07:00]  This is, yeah, yeah.  This is like the soundtrack to a glory hole right here.  It's got to be.  Ready for a douche chill?  Yeah, you are really going to, like, freeze up on this one.  Oh, my God.  This is it.  Maybe it sounds better with a big schwance in you.  I don't know.  Let's take a listen to Who Let the Mets Out.  Oh, the obligatory live clip. 
[02:07:30]  I don't want to wait.  But he's still ready.  The one-two pitch.  Swing and the Mets, he's hook it up.  The ball game is over.  And the Mets have clicked the wild card in the National League.  And for the first shot in franchise history, the Mets are going to the first season for the second consecutive year.  Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[02:08:00]  And the Mets are going back to the table.  Thompson, this is so nice, the author is something.  A liar.  The P.I.O.  Everybody's hitting the ball.  See you then, Johnny Franco.  We're in the playoffs.  Stop telling patients.  Bobby Jones.  Because it's here, we're taking it all.  We're going to be John Walker.  Oh, my God.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Who let the Mets Out?  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Who let the Mets Out?  Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[02:08:30]  Who let the Mets Out?  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  We got the Mets Out, my home.  London, right, Derrick Bell.  Got that card door.  I'm so.  We got the Mets in the bullpen.  We got the Mets in the bullpen.  We got the Mets in the bullpen. 
[02:09:00]  We got the Mets in the bullpen.  We got the Mets in the bullpen.  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucks ass. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, my God.  That could be the gayest thing I've ever heard.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  They can't be playing that as a real song.  Jason from Jersey.  This is so gay, even for Z100.  People don't like playing that as a real song, huh?  To get the sitting rounding behind the Mets.  Oh, yeah.  That ought to make you proud to be a Mets fan, guys. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, man.  That makes how you're doing seem like a Grammy winner.  Yeah.  I would have to admit that, being a Mets fan.  Come on, guys.  Quit it.  This isn't a real song.  You're pulling our leg.  You just wrote this during commercials, didn't you?  No.  That is being played.  Kelly.  Hey.  Hey.  You know what I think of?  I just think of, like, all the Mets jumping in a gay bar up and down to that music.  And Marco, Jay Moore, and Fez all standing there just watching their asses, just snapping 
[02:10:30]  their fingers over their head.  Yeah.  That's the image I get.  Who let the Mets out?  Go Mets.  Go you Mets.  Who let the Mets out?  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  That is so bad.  I just hope the guys over there are playing that as a goof.  Like, they make fun of it every time they play it, right?  Oh, I doubt it.  No.  You don't think so?  You really think they're playing it and they're taking it serious?  Hey, everybody.  Coming up, we're going to be playing our favorite, our most requested song here on Z100. 
[02:11:00]  Who let the Mets out?  Come on.  Go Mets.  Someone's serious.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  This is O.P. and Anthony's Year in Review.  1027 WNEW.  We're talking about O.J.  There's going to be a story coming out on, what, The Enquirer?  Yeah.  Because O.J. broke up with his girlfriend? 
[02:11:30]  Well, it seems to be.  Her girlfriend broke up with O.J.  Yeah, sorry.  She broke up with him and she started seeing things and really seeing the light.  Well, I guess, first of all, she's a Nicole Brown Simpson lookalike.  Uh-huh.  They were doing a lot of blow together.  Yeah.  And she's starting to see the light, like you said, that, wow, this guy may have killed  Nicole Brown Simpson after all.  She's convinced.  I mean, she is 100% sure that O.J. killed those two people, just like everyone else.  Does she feel stupid now? 
[02:12:00]  Like that everybody, from the second she hooked up with him, were like, what are you, insane?  This guy's a murderer.  But no, now she realizes.  Yeah.  His light is just slowly rotting away.  And now I hear things like she's saying that he leaves messages on her answering machine.  He broke into her house to try to erase one of the messages because they were very incriminating,  very angry.  And then he's been peering through her windows there.  Yeah.  Well, she says he's stalking her. 
[02:12:30]  Sure.  Hello, hello, this is O.J.  Hello?  Pick up the phone.  Pick up the phone.  Please, look, please pick up the phone.  It's for O.J.  I'll wait.  Hello?  Hello?  You goddamn bitch, pick up the goddamn phone.  I'll cut your mother effing head off.  Oh, damn, I'll put that on tape.  Okay.  I got to break in.  I got, oh, damn, I shouldn't be saying this on tape.  Hello, pick up, please.  O.J.  O.J., I didn't do nothing.  So, it gets crazier, though. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, there's drugs involved.  I guess this ex-girlfriend's going to tell the Inquirer that O.J. blamed Nicole for her  own death, saying she drove him crazy.  This girl, Christy Prade, the blonde, Nicole look-alike.  And, yeah, it seems that O.J. gave her these graphic details of the murder.  And stuff that she says only the killer would know. 
[02:13:30]  Second-by-second synopsis of the murder by O.J.  During all-night cocaine binges, she says, O.J. would maniacally reenact scenes from his  murder trial, pretending to cross-examine witnesses.  Like all, all coked up.  All right, here's how it was.  I've got a confidence to my left, right?  And I'm over here. 
[02:14:00]  And, you know, the rest of the dream team is over here.  And there's a witness on there.  Now, let me ask you, Mr. Farr, what did you do with the blood evidence when you picked it up?  And now he's got no answer.  I put it in a bag and brought it to a lab.  See, now he's put it in a bag.  But where did that bag come from?  A sterile bag.  Another sterile bag.  Ah, but you know, where's the sterilizing company?  My blood could have dripped on the sterilizing companies.  Where's some more cocaine?  Hello, pick up.  Pick up.  I need more cocaine.  Oh, damn, I should have said that on the tape. 
[02:14:30]  This isn't the O.J.  This isn't O.J.  This is Pedro Guerrero.  Please, pick up the phone.  I said, Pedro Guerrero.  He's got a coke problem, Pedro Guerrero.  Because whenever he has some, he never gives me any.  That's a problem.  Pedro Guerrero.  Remember that?  Like months ago, it turns out that a 911 call was made by O.J.  saying that his chick, this chick, this Krisky Pratty girl, was fighting with him. 
[02:15:00]  I love the O.J. prank call thing.  The 911.  So he calls 911 and says, you know, that there's a problem at the house,  and she's all drugged out of her mind,  and it was Pedro Guerrero that gets out of the cocaine.  Pedro Guerrero.  Hello, 911.  Pedro Guerrero's got the go game.  He's a bad guy.  And let me tell you, he cuts it, too, with that baby laxative.  I'm clapping my brain now. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, O.J. blamed the call for her own death,  saying she drove him crazy.  O.J. insisted that Pratty abort two of his babies,  then completely forgot about the first abortion,  saying he blocked out unpleasant events.  Oh, God.  God.  I blocked it out.  What baby?  What fetus?  What abortion?  I blocked all that out.  I blocked out unpleasant things except the time I slit my wife's throat.  Who is O.J.?  I blocked out unpleasant things, 
[02:16:00]  and I'm pretty damn unpleasant.  I'm the O.J.  She also says Simpson has a lump on his kidney,  and his health is so bad,  Pratty believes he'll be dead in three years.  Think we'll get a deathbed confession out of O.J.?  I doubt it,  but that show would be good.  Wouldn't that be great?  But I think he's so pompous,  he would never do it.  Hi, this is O.J. 
[02:16:30]  I know I'm dying,  and I want to come clean.  Nicole and Ron,  it was Pedro Guerrero.  Pedro Guerrero.  Goddamn O.J.  He ain't fessing up to crap.  And, uh,  Pratty also says after breaking up with the O.J.  out of fear that she'd end up like Nicole, 
[02:17:00]  Pratty claims she broke into a suburban Miami apartment  and has been peering into her windows,  stalking her just like he did to Nicole before her murder.  Oh, man.  He's doing the same thing.  Doesn't anyone...  Who still thinks this guy didn't do it?  Pratty says a coked up O.J.  told her over and over his account of what happened  the night of the murder.  In Simpson's scenario,  he described the culprit as two killers.  The culprit.  While he never flat out admitted to her 
[02:17:30]  that he was the actual killer,  the two killers,  O.J. often referred to himself  in the third person.  Saying O.J. is this,  or O.J. did that.  Or O.J. needs to get coke from Pedro Guerrero.  There were two killers,  I swear.  It was O. and J.  I swear.  O. grabbed Nicole.  Then J. came up  and slid her throat. 
[02:18:00]  And while she was falling down,  O. grabbed Ron Goldman  as J. was in hot pursuit.  They killed.  And then O. went to Chicago  and J. chipped golf balls at his house.  Hello, pick up, this is O.  J. is very...  I am a nice guy  and want to warn you about J.  J. is a murderer.  But O. is a nice guy.  O. is that fun-loving guy  you see on the naked gun movie. 
[02:18:30]  But J.  O. he's a bad man  who cuts people up with knives.  Watch out.  Uh-oh, here comes J.  Shut up, you whore.  I'm the J.  Shut up, O. you pussy.  Yeah, it's looking...  It's looking like he is  coming apart at the seams.  Physically and mentally.  Yeah.  Doing coke?  How old is this guy?  He's 50-some, right?  At this point, 52 or so?  53.  And she claims he's doing the coke?  Well...  Now that I've seen how O. J. 
[02:19:00]  is stalking me  since I left him,  I realized the truth.  And it was in front of me  all the time, she says.  But I was blinded by love.  I see now that  all during the course  of our relationship,  O. J. was confessing  by telling me details  only the killer would know.  I don't know.  I just noticed  from testimony.  But it appears  that Nicole said,  Oh, damn, O. J.,  please don't kill me.  Just a detail  that I may have  picked up in the trial.  And Ron said, 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my God, O. J.,  what are you doing?  Put that knife down.  Small detail.  Hey, why am I on the phone?  Oh, racist.  I got to bring it  to your house.  Damn.  Why'd I pick this up?  Yeah, so, um,  she's out  and scared  and she's talking  to the Enquirer.  Cool.  I can't wait to read that.  I love that stuff.  That should be out  real soon, huh?  Yeah.  Hi, this is Pedro Guerrero.  Could I please have O.J.'s  answering machine tape? 
[02:20:00]  I'll give you some coke.  Pedro Guerrero.  We got to find  the long version  of that bit  when it first came in.  Pedro goddamn Guerrero.  Hanging him out  to dry to the police.  Yeah.  Do we have  the long version of that?  The O is the smiling one.  The J wears  a French beret  and a goatee.  It's the evil J.  The Pedro Guerrero stuff  is really funny.  Pedro.  No, no, no.  So this is the, uh,  this is the story  where actual 911 tapes 
[02:20:30]  because his girl,  the one we've just  been talking about,  Yeah.  Uh, was doing  way too much coke  with supposedly  Pedro Guerrero.  Yeah, this is O.J.  actually calling  into 911  because his chick  was so drug-fueled  and crazy  that she, like,  took off at the car  or something.  Some kind of story  that he gave  that he gave  the police.  But just the fact  that O.J.  was calling 911  and he was probably  all coked up  at the time.  Yeah, here it is.  Okay.  With a 911 call.  Let's check out  the 911 call.  All right.  Hey, Sarah, 
[02:21:00]  police inquire.  Where's your emergency?  We have a problem here.  I'm trying to get a girl  to go to rehab  and do a drug  with Pedro Guerrero.  Does anybody  have any rest here?  We've been doing drugs  for two days  with Pedro Guerrero.  We just got arrested  on cocaine  and I'm trying to get her  to leave her out  and go into rehab  right now.  Is anybody  getting anyone right now?  No, no, no.  Does anybody have  any weapons?  No, no, no.  Does anybody have  any weapons?  No.  That's my favorite.  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not this time. 
[02:21:30]  Not this time.  She had to ask  if anyone was getting  hit or hurt  or if he has weapons.  Does the woman  have another mouth  under her mouth now  that's really bloody?  No, not this time.  That's in a lake in Chicago. 
[02:22:00]  Don't make me  get on a plane.  Oh, I cut my knuckle  on the nine  when I was dialing 911.  That's where  the blood's from.  I swear.  Where's Robert Kardashian?  Help me, please.  Wait, no.  I want to call.  No, no, no.  Don't think that.  No, no.  Does anyone hurt 
[02:22:30]  need rescue?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  I love, don't make me  get a Bronco.  Now, what is he doing?  Does he call 911 back?  Oh, no, 911 calls  his home, I believe.  I guess they were  disconnected or something  and then 911  usually calls back.  Okay, so here's the  second one.  Hello, O.J.  How is...  Oh, police?  I want you to call the police.  Hello?  Hello?  This is the juice. 
[02:23:00]  Now, what happened?  I don't know.  You hear O.J. going,  I want you to call the police.  I had to hit her  over the head  with the phone receiver  and we just disconnected.  I like him.  Hello?  This is the police department.  Oh, she left  and I don't know  what to do about it.  Man, she's frustrated.  She...  This guy, Pedro Guerrero,  got arrested  for having 15 keys  of cocaine.  This girl spent  the last two days  doing drugs with him.  Me and her friend  just came over to say, 
[02:23:30]  you're going into a rehab.  She got mad.  She just got in her car.  She drives a Mercedes.  She lives in the crossings.  Now, she is  loaning out of her mind  in her Mustang  driving around town.  What part of the Mustang?  The driver's life  is nothing,  but she needs to be stopped.  What part of the Mustang?  It's white.  It's a black car.  Like a Bronco.  Is she black or white?  She's a white girl.  Okay, thank you.  I got to go and see  if I can find her.  Okay.  All right.  That's all I need  to white girl.  This has got to be 
[02:24:00]  a comedy routine.  I believe Al Cowling  is driving.  OJ calls 911.  It's OJ putting out  a prank call tag.  Is that what's going on here?  The best of OJ.  Right.  I call 911 around the country.  Get my 911 comedy tape.  OJ calls 911.  Hello, 911?  911 operator.  Is your refrigerator  running now?  Yes, it is.  Well, you got a picture. 
[02:24:30]  911?  911, what's your emergency?  Hello, do you have  Prince Albert in a can?  What do you mean?  Do you have  Prince Albert in a can?  Yes, we do.  Well, you better  let him out  before he suffocates.  That's the OJ Simpson  911 comedy tape.  All of yours now. 
[02:25:00]  Hello, is this 911?  Yes.  Do you have  10-pound balls?  Yes, we do.  How do you walk?  You'll skip a piece of OJ Simpson.  I've got to go now.  I've got to find her.  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh?  Oh, man.  I was hoping he would do 
[02:25:30]  the famous butt plug  if I call it.  Hello, 911?  911?  Yes.  I'm looking for  Michael Hunt.  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike.  Walk along with  your favorite murderer, OJ.  911?  911?  Yes?  Uh, butt plug.  Bug box? 
[02:26:00]  Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Don't make me cut your  throat, mother.  Does OJ do any, like,  character voices  on his prank call tape?  Kind of like  the Jerky Boys?  I'll come down there  with my tube box.  I'll bash your head  in with a ratchet. 
[02:26:30]  Or a knife.  I'm OJ.  Oops, I just cut myself  on a piece of foam rubber.  I better fly to Chicago.  Oh, man.  That's the OJ Simpson  911 comedy tape.  Order yours now.  Friggin' OJ, man.  He's back.  I love him.  Thank God.  There you go.  From the ONA archives. 
[02:27:00]  One of our faves,  by the way.  I love that.  I love the fact that  he's still in the news  every so often,  just pops up.  Yeah, but the OJ.  So, Pedro Guerrero  was caught with 15 keys.  Pedro Guerrero  caught with 15 kilos  of cocaine  and a dead hooker  in his trunk.  And the story  never made the regular news.  No, no, no, no.  OJ knows this.  No, no.  That's right.  Pedro Guerrero.  And then OJ said  she bought a Mustang.  Brother Smith  just carjacked me. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  I swear.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  I just heard shots fired  and I see Deacon Jones  running down the street  with a gun.  I swear,  you know Deacon Jones.  He was accused  of killing two people.  I swear,  Lawrence Taylor  smoking crack.  Oh, wait.  That's true.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:00]  All of the Dallas Cowboys  are raping women.  Hello.  Hello.  I just saw  Brian Piccolo  killing somebody.  Oh, wait a minute.  He's dead.  Who killed him?  He's talking about  a Mustang.  Yeah,  was it a Mercedes  or a Mustang?  What kind of car  was it?  He's all...  No, no, no.  He gets everything  all screwed up. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah,  this Inquirer article,  I can't wait.  Right from the bitch's mouth.  All right.  Well, there you go,  Anthony.  Brilliant.  Another OJ story.  He makes it interesting  every day.  All right,  we've got to take  a quick break.  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  OJ.  Anthony.  You guys in conflict  piss me off,  okay?  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  OJ.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[02:29:00]  We have to talk about  our third contest  that's running right now,  Anthony.  We're contest crazy.  In an O&A sort of way.  Right.  Let's not forget  we're also doing  Mommy,  What Would You Do  for NSYNC tickets.  I hate to be biased  because our contestopia  like our children,  but I do have a favorite,  and it is Mommy,  What Would You Do  for NSYNC tickets.  Nice.  The concept is great.  You got the mothers  of young daughters 
[02:29:30]  that want to see NSYNC  very badly.  Right.  The young girls.  Right.  And the mothers  will do anything  to make their little girl happy.  Absolutely anything.  Because the ages  of the girls  that usually want  to see NSYNC,  it's just when they start  butting heads  with the mom.  Right.  Trying to make it  their own ground.  So the moms  will usually do anything  to make their girls happy.  And what better  than NSYNC tickets.  My God.  Well,  we got to figure out  how to do this contest 
[02:30:00]  the right way this time.  Yeah.  Because our Mommy,  What Would You Do  for Britney Spears contest  fell apart.  Well,  it didn't.  But I mean,  it turned out okay  because we finally got  one mommy  to come down here  and shoot bottle rockets  out of her,  out of her.  Okay.  Look.  What?  What?  You can't say that word  just not in that context.  Oh.  Like,  I could say  you're being  a stupid twat  and that would  make the air. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  But you can't refer  to certain parts  of the female anatomy.  So when I said  that a mommy  came down here  and was shooting  bottle rockets  out of her.  Oh God.  Jesus.  What?  Look,  I'm at a dump now.  Oh,  all right.  No,  I'm just trying to learn.  Well,  why don't you sit down  with CBS lawyers  and they can beat you  about the head and neck  with phone books.  I've been doing radio  half my life  but I don't know  all the rules.  Yes,  it's all  you're teaching me this one.  It's all in the context open. 
[02:31:00]  Yes,  I know.  I could say  you're being a dick.  Right.  But then you can't use  that same word  to describe a certain part  of the male anatomy.  Ah,  see how it works?  It's so simple,  plain and clear.  Well,  the fact remains  that mommy came down here  and shot bottle rockets  out of a peach.  There you go.  Out of a peach?  Yeah.  Out of her whale's eye.  Uh-huh,  that's also good.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  So we saved that contest  but barely. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah,  because we had a bunch  of contenders  that were going to come up  and remember anal sex?  Yeah,  I remember.  Going to have a couple  come up here  and have anal sex.  Yeah,  I remember.  See,  what does that have to do  with anything?  Yeah.  They were going to have  anal sex  so their young son  can see Britney Spears.  Correct.  Right here in front  of everybody.  Correct.  They blew us off.  Yeah,  the mother-daughter  queefing team  blew us off  but they did queef  over the phone  which was very good.  Remember the daughter 
[02:32:00]  had the high piccolo  type queef  and the mother  was more like a bassoon.  It was cute.  Yeah,  it was a family moment  right out of the Waltons  I would say.  Very,  very quaint moment.  Right.  And we just need  more people.  Instead of like  setting a day aside  where we have  all the mommies  come down  and then we look  like losers  when only one mommy  shows up,  I think we should  just say  contest is on.  Oh,  that's good.  So now if somebody  has an idea  they come down  and do it.  They can come down  tomorrow  and set the bar.  Okay. 
[02:32:30]  I like that idea.  That's much better  than a one day  no one shows up thing.  Because those days  just suck.  Yeah.  So contest is on.  Yeah.  Mommy,  what would you do  for NSYNC tickets?  Yeah.  All right.  And also feel free  to call  and let us know  what this is  before you stop that.  Ah.  Gay Marco,  what's up?  Oh my God.  I have to have  these tickets.  Please.  Oh my God.  I love NSYNC. 
[02:33:00]  Oh my God.  I stood outside  Three simple words.  I am gay.  Oh my God.  I stood outside  Good Morning America  on Monday  for six hours  in the freezing cold  and I just saw  the top of their head.  That's all I could see.  Marco.  Marco.  Give us your hay.  Hay.  It's him.  I just have to confirm it.  You want to confirm the hay  to make sure it's him, Anthony?  Hold on, Marco.  Let me get my hay.  I got the hay.  Oh, okay. 
[02:33:30]  Here is your hay.  Here is Marco  doing the famous hay.  Hay.  Hay.  Hay.  Hay.  Hay.  Hay.  That's him.  Gay.  Hay.  All right, gay Marco.  Oh my God.  Hay.  Oh my God.  Hay.  I have fantasies  of having an orgy  with NSYNC.  God damn it.  Jesus.  Justin Timberlake  on the bottom.  Then me.  Then J.C.  Poor guy.  Then Joey Orley.  Right. 
[02:34:00]  Then Lance and Chris  in each hand.  All right.  Oh my God.  You'd have everything working.  Hands, feet, mouth.  You'd look like a puppeteer.  Love him.  Love him.  Unbelievable.  That's no strings.  Oh my God.  It's the no strings.  All right.  You're very excited.  Marco,  even though there's no chance  in hell  we would ever consider  you coming down here  and doing something,  what would you do  for NSYNC tickets?  I would give oral sex  to a woman  even though it would  make me vomit.  Yeah, that's disgusting. 
[02:34:30]  You know something?  Now that might be funny  to have him come down  and do that.  Oh my God.  That's as bad as  like asking a straight guy  to do it to another guy.  To hob a knob.  Oh my God.  This guy is so unbelievably gay  that the thought of a lady  naked in front of him  disgusts him.  Oh God.  The smell of it.  It was just like that.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Marco.  Just imagine it.  For the NSYNC tickets 
[02:35:00]  we bring in a  hot  19 year old lesbian  with huge  34 Ds.  Oh God.  You pull down  the tight cotton panties  and they're staring you in the face.  Oh my God.  I have shrinkage.  They're staring you in the face  is the sweetest,  youngest,  ripest  peachy.  Ew.  Ew.  Yeah.  And then  you slowly approach it  getting  getting that nice  unbelievable fragrance. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  You know you're close.  And then  after a little nuzzling  stop, stop, stop, stop.  After a little nuzzling  you're just  your face beat  my friend.  Oh my God.  That's right.  And as you  take a taste of the peach  all of a sudden  you hear her say  eh, eh, eh.  Eh, eh, eh.  Now that would be  a hell of a  Oh my God.  That would be a hell of a 
[02:36:00]  sex campaign.  Eh, eh, eh.  What do you think, Margo?  I would do anything.  I would, I would succumb  to anything  to see you think.  I love them.  Hey.  Hey.  Eh, eh.  Hey.  Eh, eh.  Baby, you're not  the only one.  Oh.  You don't have to be  afraid.  Is he hearing that?  I would sing all the songs.  When we are apart.  Hey, why don't you sing along  to this song for us, all right?  Yeah, sing along.  I can't hear it.  All right, you fag.  Hold on. 
[02:36:30]  Hold on.  You should be able  to hear this.  Ready?  Go.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  When I'm with you.  Hey.  When we are apart,  I feel it too.  Eh, eh, eh.  And no matter what I think.  I feel like I'm with you.  Eh, eh, eh.  Come on, sing.  We know we're about you.  Sing, you homo.  Come on.  Eh, eh, eh.  All right.  Now wait.  Then I have to get out for you guys.  What?  I have Mets tickets  for Sunday night.  I'm already going. 
[02:37:00]  My boyfriend dumped me this week.  I'm so sad.  He took a dump on you?  We broke up.  So I have nobody to go with  to the game.  I'm so sad.  Yeah, like it's so hard  to find another fag.  Pull out your fag bait  and troll around Christopher Street.  Everyone is begging us  to have Marco eat the peach.  Well, that would be funny, man.  For that NSYNC tickets.  Marco, you're dead serious.  You really want these NSYNC tickets.  I want these tickets so bad. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, my God.  I have to see them.  I have to breathe  the same air as JC.  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  Listen, Ant.  Ant, let me put the plea out there.  All right.  We need a lady.  If you're a faithful listener  to this show,  we need a lady  to take one for the team.  Marco,  can I ask you something?  Yeah.  What would be  more heinous to you?  A very hot-looking girl  or an ugly-looking,  maybe out-of-shape type girl?  Yeah, that's a good question. 
[02:38:00]  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It's equally as discussed.  Yeah, because I guess  that's like asking us  what would be worse,  a hot guy  or a fat guy.  Or a beer belly guy.  It's like,  how do you make that choice  unless you're Rick?  Hey, Marco.  Yeah?  What if we found a girl  that is willing to have you,  you know,  take a taste of her peach  and then she gets you  to go to NSYNC with you?  Oh, I don't care.  Fine, yes.  Hmm, that is very interesting.  I don't have a boyfriend anymore,  so it doesn't matter.  The only thing is  it really takes out of the mix 
[02:38:30]  the doing it for your child's sake  because the mother now  would have to go.  Or send her daughter  with Marco.  Sure, I'll babysit.  Which is probably a safe date.  That's a very safe date.  Unless you've got an ass  like a nine-year-old boy.  I mean, come on,  we'd do all the songs together.  I could do her hair.  Oh, my God.  What a fan.  Oh, my God.  Do you think Richard Gere is cute?  Oh, no.  No?  No?  Someone is moaning.  Sadiqa.  Yes? 
[02:39:00]  Why are you moaning?  Because I want to see NSYNC.  And how old are you?  18.  You're 18  and you want to see NSYNC.  Yes.  And listen, she's crying.  All right.  Are you crying?  Yes.  Why?  Because I love her so much.  All right, Marco,  cry along with Sadiqa.  Oh, my God.  I love them so much.  I love Sadiqa.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  I want to see them so bad.  Sadiqa, you love them, huh?  Yes.  And have you ever seen them?  Yes, I've seen them before. 
[02:39:30]  Have you ever had a gay guy  go s***ing on you?  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So now, why are you crying, though?  I don't get it.  Because I love them.  You don't understand.  You don't know unless you're there.  I've never been to any of their concerts.  I thought you just said you saw them already.  No, I went to their hotel.  Oh, and you saw them going into their hotel?  Absolutely, yeah.  And that's why this contest is pure brilliance. 
[02:40:00]  Absolutely.  Mommy, what would you do for NSYNC tickets?  But now it's getting even more twisted.  Yeah, because now this girl is 18.  You're 18 and you're so like...  How good are our seats?  Great.  We have great seats.  Oh, God.  Was that the girl or what?  I know.  Who was that?  Right.  Tadika.  Yes?  Great seat.  Yeah.  Really close.  You'll get a great view.  Who's your favorite?  Joey.  Ew. 
[02:40:30]  What?  What's wrong with Joey?  What's the matter, Marco?  Ew, he's so dirty.  No, he's not.  Don't you make fun of Tadika?  He's not hot.  Well, calm down, everyone, because we've got a proposition for everyone on the phone.  We know they're all equally as hot.  No.  No.  Joey's the cutest.  All right, Tadika.  Jacey is the most talented cutest.  No, he's not.  I'll fag and an 18-year-old girl arguing over NSYNC.  All right, listen, listen, listen.  Someone better make sure that Kristen on line one does not hang up.  Right.  Because she is willing to do this, but we'll give Tadika a try. 
[02:41:00]  Tadika.  Yes?  What are you willing to do for NSYNC tickets?  Anything.  Anything.  Anything.  Would you be willing to come into the studio?  What do you look like?  Yeah, give us a little description.  Um, I'm 5'4", brown hair, blue eyes.  Hmm.  Yeah.  125 pounds.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Nice body?  Yes.  Young, firm, big boobs, small boobs.  Yes.  Big.  Very nice.  Of what is your heritage? 
[02:41:30]  Huh?  What is your heritage?  What's your background?  Hello?  Yeah, what's your background, like your heritage?  What race are you?  I know the word's a big one, but, uh, what's your nationality?  Tadika.  Hey, where'd she go?  Tadika.  God damn it.  She's gone.  Yeah, something clicked.  Marco?  Yes?  She might call back.  That's why I said make sure we don't hang up on Kristen.  Kristen?  Yes, what's going on?  Are you the one willing to take one for the team?  Yes, but I want something in return. 
[02:42:00]  I don't like and think, so I don't want that.  All right.  Can I ask for something?  Oh, my God.  We got a ton of girls that are willing to do this.  Let's see.  We might be able to, uh...  Okay.  I have really, really good seats for Dice.  I'm going to MSG.  Okay.  I want to know if there's any way in hell I'd be able to at least meet him and say  hi.  Can we get this girl backstage to meet Dice?  I think we can.  I think we can.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then you would be willing to let gay Marco taste your peach.  Oh, God.  Yes.  I even asked my husband, and he said it was okay. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Why would he say it's okay?  Because the guy's gay, so...  Yeah.  And so am I.  Can he be in the room at the same time?  No.  Gay Marco, this cannot be pleasurable to you at all.  Stop saying.  I hope I can bring three of my girlfriends with me, and they can correct him while he does  it.  Yeah.  The three girls all have to be, like, topless, and you're, like, bottomless, and then Marco  have to do a thing.  Oh, God. 
[02:43:00]  Kristen.  How bad do you want these tickets, buddy?  Oh, my God.  I want them so bad.  Kristen.  Yeah?  Describe how hot you are, and listen to Marco lose it.  Well, I have really big boobs.  There you go.  Boobs, Marco.  Game of the book.  I have, like, blondish-brown hair, and I'm five-foot-one, and...  Nice shape.  Oh, I have a nice shape.  Do you keep the peach trimmed?  Oh, yeah, very, and I have a tattoo right next to it.  Oh, yeah.  So Marco's going to be staring right at it, inches away from the peach, Marco, and then... 
[02:43:30]  I'll run my fingers through his hair.  Oh, yeah.  How long would you allow him to taste the peach?  Well, as long as you want to put him through the torture for the ticket.  Yeah, good.  You are a trooper.  You are good.  You are really a trooper.  I got it.  I got it.  How about for the duration of one NSYNC tune?  You're a trooper for me.  That ain't bad, though.  That's like three minutes.  And Marco will even allow you to pick the NSYNC song. 
[02:44:00]  Okay.  But if there's not action going on during the whole song, then you're out.  Oh, God.  Marco, have you ever done anything with a girl?  No.  Never.  That's great.  That's great.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  I think we don't have contest rules yet, Anthony.  I think we might have to change the contest.  Could you see Marco getting finished and going, that was great, guys.  Right.  Yeah.  I'll turn him straight. 
[02:44:30]  When's Talica coming to town?  Dan's got a great suggestion.  What did Dan say?  That might be hard to pull off.  Listen to Marco yell.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  How are you?  Good.  Tell Marco your suggestion.  I'm a sad guy.  Wouldn't it be a little more torture if he had to have vaginal intercourse?  Impossible.  Why is it impossible?  Yeah.  Why is it impossible?  Yeah.  Why?  It's just not going to happen. 
[02:45:00]  Why?  I mean, right now, I have shrinkage so much from even the thought of this.  Oh, God.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Marco?  Yeah.  All right.  And the deal is what?  Marco has to eat the peach?  Yeah.  Marco, who is just a flaming fag, has to now go south on a girl for the first time ever.  You guys got to understand this.  For Marco to do this, it is as disgusting as one of us going south on a guy. 
[02:45:30]  There you go.  Marco, are you going to be all right?  I don't even know what I would do.  He's never done this job.  Yeah, he's going to be real experienced.  All I know is like suction.  He's going to kind of stroke something.  Right.  All he knows is suction.  Oh, God.  There you go.  Thank you, Marco.  Thanks for that visual.  I think we got a connection.  Yeah, let's arrange a date that we can do this. 
[02:46:00]  Marco, when can you do this?  Well, I have to go to work and see what Dan did and get off.  All right.  Get off.  Where?  From the florist or the interior decorator company?  From the factory.  Oh, that's right.  The factory.  You weren't there?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Bye, bye, bye.  Bye, bye, bye.  He's so good.  Sing, Marco. 
[02:46:30]  Bye, bye, bye, bye.  Oh, I'm doing it tonight.  Hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey.  I love you and me.  Wonderful.  Think about it, Marco.  Okay.  All right.  You get to pick the NSYNC song throughout the duration of the song.  You have to eat the peach.  I can't wait to see this. 
[02:47:00]  You guys, I need earphones or, like, earplugs while he's doing it.  Why?  Because the thought of, like, listening to NSYNC and being s***ed out by a fag.  Oh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Yeah, we can't quite be so graphic.  That was good, but, yeah, it didn't make the radio.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  You want to block out all the noise, is what you're saying, so you need headphones.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't want to hear the music, and you certainly don't want to hear Marco.  Yeah, I just want to pretend I'm somewhere else.  Okay.  Kristen, this is probably going to be the worst oral you're ever, ever going to have in your 
[02:47:30]  life, because he's just not even going to know what to do with it.  Oh, my God.  If I don't vomit.  Marco, I'll be dreaming about you.  You got everyone's number and info and everything.  Hey, Marco.  What have I done?  Well, you're going to, hey, you're going to go to NSYNC, is what you've done.  Oh, my God.  Yes, calm down.  Marco, I got some audio of us, the day you have to eat the peach.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Right. 
[02:48:00]  You have, we might have to brief him on some techniques.  Yeah, we'll have, like, a bunch of guys call and help them out with some pointers and stuff.  We'll walk you through it.  There are certain, you know, little basic rules to it here, too.  Right.  There you go.  It's not like painting a fence.  It's not like a man, either, so you don't have to use your fist.  Oh.  Oh.  Right.  He's so happy.  He's so, uh, what's another word for happy?  Gay.  That's right.  All right, we've got to take a quick break. 
[02:48:30]  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Oh, and I know.  Conquer us, you bastards.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  N-E-W.  I'm a listener for 20 years.  Yesterday, I was working, and I was in my car, and I wanted to respond to something Carol  Miller said, and it was something positive. 
[02:49:00]  So I pulled over and tried to call you guys, and I got such a runaround, and I never got  through to Carol.  Do you want us to find Carol for you?  Well, yeah.  Is she around?  Sure.  Hold on a sec.  Great.  N-E-W.  Yeah, hi.  I'm a listener, fan, whatever.  I'm trying to reach Carol Miller.  Oh, yeah.  Responding to some stuff she was talking about yesterday.  All right.  You'll need personnel.  Hold on.  Okay, thanks.  Hello, personnel.  May I help you?  Yeah, hi.  I'm a 20-year listener and a fan of the show, of station, rather.  And I was trying to reach Carol Miller yesterday, and unfortunately, I couldn't get through. 
[02:49:30]  And I was wondering who I can talk to to try to either leave something for her or get a  fax number.  I'd rather talk to somebody, though.  Talk to somebody for Carol Miller?  Yep.  Oh, hold on.  You need the jock line?  I'm sorry?  Please hold.  We'll connect you to the jock line.  Jock line.  Okay, thank you.  Jock line.  Hi.  Hi.  Is this the jock line?  Yes.  Who am I speaking with?  This is John.  Hi, John.  Hi.  My name is Cindy Reich, and I'm at least a 20-year listener.  Hi, Cindy.  Who are you looking for?  I'm looking for Carol Miller, who might not still be there, but I'm at work. 
[02:50:00]  Well, I don't...  I tried to reach her yesterday, and I couldn't.  I don't see her in the jock lounge.  Hold on.  She might be in the break room.  Hold on a sec, please.  Thank you.  Helena.  Hi.  Hi.  They were trying to connect to a Carol Miller if she was in there.  Oh, I just saw her go by.  I think she went to her office.  Hold on.  Okay, thank you.  Hello, Carol Miller's office.  May I help you?  Yeah, hi.  They're trying to connect to a Carol Miller.  Carol Miller.  And who is this calling?  It's a 20-year fan of the station who needs to respond to something she was talking about yesterday. 
[02:50:30]  Well, I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.  The thing she's on her way out.  Let me see if I can connect you to the garage.  Okay, I'm not.  I'll leave a message.  You can contact me, or maybe I'll call you.  Well, let me try to connect you to the garage.  Thank you.  I'm just trying to get Carol Miller so I can respond to her.  I'm a 20-year fan.  I'm just trying to leave her a message in person if I can.  And they said she might be in the garage.  Actually, I can connect you to her car phone.  She just pulled out of here in her Mercedes.  Great.  Hold on a second.  Okay.  Hello?  Carol Miller's car.  Carol?  No, I'm taking Carol's car up to get her. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, okay.  Hello?  They told me I could...  Wait, hold on, please.  Hold on.  Okay, thank you.  Get out of the way, you son of a bitch!  This is Carol Miller's car!  Get out of the way!  Yes, hold on, kid.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Is Carol around?  I'm a 20-year fan.  They're just trying to reach her, and they keep trying to find her for me.  Hey, well, I'm a 30-year-old con ed worker.  You reached a phone booth.  How can I help you?  You've got to be kidding me.  No, I'm not kidding you. 
[02:51:30]  Who's this?  Are you serious?  Because I was just on the phone with N.E.W., and they kept connecting me, connecting me,  connecting me.  Well, they connected me to a phone booth.  Great.  All right, thanks.  Who's this?  I just told you, I'm a fan of N.E.W.  that's trying to reach Carol Miller, and I don't know how it's going to be.  I'll tell you, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Wait, hold on.  Can you connect me back?  I'll see what I can do if I hit the thing.  Hold on, Lee.  Okay, thank you.  It's the United Flight 36, 7 Heavy.  Hello?  Yes.  Is this air traffic control?  I don't want air traffic control. 
[02:52:00]  I was trying to reach Carol Miller, and they keep bumping me around.  Why are you on the aircraft frequency, ma'am?  This is United Flight 7 Heavy.  Can you somehow connect me back to Carol Miller's car phone?  Can I ask you, please?  I'm trying to land an airliner, ma'am.  I really don't have time.  Well, it's a crossing of wires.  I apologize.  It's not my fault.  30 degree flaps.  Hold on.  30 degree flaps.  Okay.  Put the gear down.  I'm trying to land an airliner, ma'am.  Okay, goodbye.  Goodbye.  I don't have time.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.
