<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a technical difficulty involving Anthony's microphone, quickly transitioning to a heavily promoted but ultimately underwhelming debut of Guns N' Roses' "Chinese Democracy."  Listener response was mixed, ranging from indifference to outright negativity.  The hosts, after initial confusion about the song's actual composition and musicians, played a listener-submitted remake of Steve's old band Foundry's song "Pendulum" instead, which was far better received.  The segment continued with calls discussing the Guns N' Roses track, a previous controversial show referred to as a "church incident," and the unexpected success of NYC's temporary waterfalls. This was followed by a Don Imus clip promoting Jim Norton's book, "I Hate Your Guts," which sparked a discussion of other comedians' books and a planned Google bomb campaign for Norton's work.  A significant portion focused on Anthony's privacy concerns regarding Google Maps' street view feature, showcasing highly detailed images of his property and neighborhood.  The broadcast returned to listener feedback on the Guns N' Roses song before moving on.  No in-studio guests were present during this segment.


The show then delved into a profanity-laced dissection of John McCain's repeated misuse of the phrases "I couldn't agree with you more" and "I couldn't disagree with you more."  The conversation extended to the upcoming presidential election, featuring commentary on Barack Obama, his supporters, potential reactions within the Black community to an Obama win or loss, and the use of "socialist" as a coded term.  A caller shared an elevator encounter with Stuntman Bob, who overheard someone predicting Obama's victory. The discussion included opinions on Obama's policies and the use of "socialist" as a potential dog whistle, along with commentary on Joe Biden's verbal gaffes and health, and John Murtha's alleged comments.  Significant time was dedicated to promoting the Opie and Anthony Halloween party, including a costume contest.  Multiple callers offered opinions on the election and engaged in prank calls.  In-studio guests included Nick DiPaolo, Stuntman Bob, and possibly others.  The segment ended with further banter about the election, unrelated topics, and continued promotion of Jim Norton's book, punctuated by frequent profanity.


The next segment began by comparing Boston police's increased Taser use to the shooting of NYPD officers in the subway, referencing Amnesty International's concerns.  Listener calls followed, including a story of a man severely injured by a tuna can lid, another about a cornea injury caused by a neighbor's fingernail, and a graphic account of a nine-year-old accidentally shot by his father in the Mojave Desert.  This led to a discussion of childhood firearm mishaps, including a near-fatal bow-and-arrow incident. A news story about fraternal twins with contrasting skin tones due to their parents' ethnicities was discussed, leading to racially charged humor. The final portion involved a bizarre segment with in-studio guest Angel, a model, her boyfriend Colin, and the hosts, featuring sexually suggestive comments, crude humor, discussions of Angel's modeling work, and suggestive photographs.  The fictional character "Ted the Serial Killer" was a recurring element, contributing darkly comedic and morbid anecdotes.  Several commercial breaks and promotions for guests and Jim Norton's book were included.


The show's final segment opened with a dismissive comment about a previous guest, "Frank the Frowner," using derogatory language.  The hosts discussed the Google phone launch, contrasting the expected long lines with the surprisingly short lines observed at the T-Mobile Times Square store, mentioning news reporter Tamsyn Fadal's presence and a past on-air incident involving her. The conversation then shifted to a bizarre discussion about the hosts' and guests' meals, featuring descriptions of unusual omelets and unhygienic eating habits.  Guests Nick DiPaolo and Robert Kelly were introduced. Nick DiPaolo then recounted a detailed and vulgar story about his childhood, including his difficult relationship with his parents, episodes of domestic violence, starvation, his father's alcoholism, and various money-making schemes.  The story included a detailed account of a near-homosexual encounter with a childhood friend.  The discussion returned to the Google phone launch, with Sam reporting on his interviews with people in line, punctuated by sarcastic commentary from the hosts.  The segment concluded with promotion of the guests' shows, Nick DiPaolo's website, and repeated requests to Google "I Hate Your Guts Jim Norton."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi.  My mic work?  Yeah, it sounds strong.  All right.  Sounds different.  Yeah, it does sound a little different.  Every day it's going to sound different.  What the hell? 
[00:00:30]  As long as it works.  Good point.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  We're here in New York City.  We work for a fine rock stage.  They've been promoting that we're going to be playing the new Guns N' Roses.  Song today. 
[00:01:00]  We're going to debut it for everybody.  Did we get in a time machine or something?  Yeah.  New Guns N' Roses.  First new song in 14 or 15 years off Chinese Democracy.  And finally it's going to be released to what?  At Best Buy or something?  Yeah.  Really?  Exclusively?  Is that what they do?  Something like that.  Later on in November.  Late November you could actually get the CD.  So the station. 
[00:01:30]  I want to play the promo.  They've been pumping.  Opie and Anthony will be playing the first new Guns N' Roses song in 15 years.  Really?  Tomorrow morning.  Really?  They have?  Yeah.  Make sure you're listening to Opie and Anthony tomorrow as they debut the brand new song  from Guns N' Roses.  You can hear the promo?  I want to hear the promo.  I had no idea we were going to be debuting the new Guns N' Roses song.  Why would you?  Why would I?  Come on.  I didn't hear the promo. 
[00:02:00]  You didn't hear the promo either?  You didn't know, did you?  Opie said it.  Exactly.  I learned it when the listeners did.  That's great.  Just right this second is when I knew it.  Some brain, why didn't Anthony know that we were going to play the brand new Guns N' Roses  song today?  I don't know.  It was in the email.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, the email.  You know, the daily email.  That old thing.  You know.  The daily email is a line of emails that are about 20 long.  Yeah.  So I click on the ones where the subject seems, you know, kind of entertaining.  What? 
[00:02:30]  Hot blonde?  Whatever.  One of those.  Your mic sucks, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There is something.  It's got to be said.  It's this tinny kind of wants to be kind of distorted.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Listen, listen.  Like when I, if I raise my voice a little bit, it gets distorted.  I'll try to turn you down.  This is, uh, now I got to turn the headphones up.  There's too much middle range.  I don't hear. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  It's completely silly.  What, what, what happens in here overnight?  I don't know what happens.  The gremlins come in and just screw with my microphone.  Yeah.  Uh, the point I'm making with the guns and roses song, they were promoting it like crazy.  Yeah.  And here we are at six Oh five.  And you would think the phones would just be like, Oh my God.  When are you going to play the song?  Maybe, uh, this, they're so busy that no one could get through.  No. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  I mean, we talk about guns or anything else.  These phones roses just go nuts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Right.  Yeah.  Guns and roses without those roses.  That seems to get the, uh, the phones ringing, but, um, safe to say there's not one person  calling in.  No one really hear the new guns and roses.  Chinese democracy.  Not a one.  Is it that no one really, um, not a one.  Should we even tease this? 
[00:04:00]  Like, uh, coming up in seven tomorrow, not a one.  If we could, you know, get, get you guys on and get it over with.  I'm thinking maybe if I'm thinking maybe if we could get, uh, I don't know, uh, 10 phone  calls to say, all right, what the hell?  Then we'll play it.  There's still not ringing for the guns and roses song.  You want to hear now or should we wait a little while?  Oh, you got to tease it. 
[00:04:30]  Gee, it's our job in radio to tease it when you have such a,  a nugget of radio gold.  You got to tease it all morning, right?  Yeah.  We all know that.  You're not going to just come out of the boxing and then give them the good stuff.  No.  You wait.  That way it keeps people, uh, at bay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brooklyn Ace is calling just to say, no, the phones aren't busy.  I got through right away.  Uh, Brooklyn Ace.  Yeah.  You stole my phone.  There, Opie.  Thanks.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[00:05:00]  But, uh, it's.  I love when Opie does that.  Opie will read the, um, read the subject matter of the phone call and then hit the phone  line.  And the guy goes, yeah, that's what I wanted to say.  And they, he just sits there like, uh, um, well, I guess you don't need me anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, well, now the phones are kind of ringing.  Yeah.  Chris from Jersey saying, I want to hear it.  Let's go to him.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris, what do you got? 
[00:05:30]  I got, I got nothing.  I'm bored driving home.  So I figured a little, uh, Guns N' Roses will make me laugh and keep me awake.  But how bad do you want to hear this brand new Guns N' Roses song?  Um, if it'll keep me awake for the next 45 minutes, I'll be more than happy.  Ooh.  Great.  Well, her, her, her.  What was the promo good?  What do we have?  I don't know.  I'm trying to find the promo.  They can't find it.  They can't find it.  Maybe they didn't promote the thing.  Maybe it was a liner.  Maybe it was a.  Yeah.  I, I haven't heard of it.  The first time I heard it was you guys talking about it this morning. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Uh, I mean, I, my, the first listen, if any other band put this song out, it wouldn't even  make a radio, but if it's, it's Guns N' Roses or, or it's, or it's  Axel with some session players, whatever.  It's not Guns N' Roses without the rest of the guys.  I was a huge Guns N' Roses fan.  Stop.  Who is it beside Axel?  Just Axel or?  Well, who can tell?  He went through a lot of guys trying to make this Chinese democracy.  Is there anybody else from the original Guns N' Roses on it or no?  You know what?  I don't even know. 
[00:06:30]  My knowledge of Guns N' Roses stopped years ago.  Yeah.  You know, when you're into a band, you're like, oh, they did.  Oh, they're doing this.  Okay.  And you kind of update your info in your head.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't care.  No clue.  And I was, I was huge into this band.  I probably saw him 10 to 12 times over the years.  Steve's a music guy.  Yeah, Steve.  Who's Steve?  I know, uh, Dizzy Reed is still the keyboard player.  Uh, and they got a guy named Bumblefoot playing guitar and they, what the hell?  They had, what is this?  Harry Potter?  They had Bucket, uh, Bumblefoot.  Buckethead was in for a while. 
[00:07:00]  Buckethead.  Yeah.  Bumblefoot and Dizzy.  Yeah.  Buckethead bailed a while ago.  Buckethead.  He was the one with that dumb bucket on his head.  Bumblefoot.  What was it?  A Kentucky Fried Chicken Bucket or something?  It was.  It was a McCartney called his wife.  Old Bumblefoot.  Um, it's Axl, obviously.  Fucking brains was his bandmate.  Um, Robin Fink.  Fucking brains.  Uh, Ron Thal.  That's, that's Bumblefoot. 
[00:07:30]  Richard Fortis.  Bumblefoot.  Tommy Stinson.  Tommy Stinson?  Wasn't he one of, uh, the replacements or something?  Who are these people?  I'm very familiar.  And I think, uh, Robin Fink was, uh, was in Nine Inch Nails.  Um, this is, uh, let me go to the phones.  Brian in Boston listening on BCA.  37 people in this band.  Yeah.  The second Spinal Tap reference in 10 minutes.  Yeah.  Hey, Brian.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  I can give a crap about GNR, but I want to hear more of the Opie and Anthony's Mike show. 
[00:08:00]  So, so you'd rather hear about Anthony's Mike problems today than the, uh, listen to the  brand new Guns N' Roses song.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  This is a little, uh, buzzy.  It's, it's buzzing.  That buzz has been there for weeks.  I gave up on that.  I gave up on most of the stuff.  No, I mean, Buzzy's, Buzzy's the bass player now.  Oh.  The band, I think.  Oh, okay.  This is a hum and a buzz.  Yeah.  I, I, we complained about that weeks ago, but why yell and scream?  I don't care.  It just doesn't matter in the end, right?  It doesn't matter.  If the, if corporate doesn't care, why should we? 
[00:08:30]  Right?  Uh, Mike in Virginia.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Hey, Anthony, your microphone is way too loud.  Can you talk softer for the rest of the show?  Oh, okay.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  How are you?  I'll talk, uh, I'll talk softer.  There you go.  Maybe that'll help.  Uh, let's say hi to Pete in New York.  Pete, how are you?  Pete.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  Listen, you cannot play that song.  You will be the biggest corporate prostitutes in the world.  I would rather hear continuous stories about a mobile charge. 
[00:09:00]  Okay.  Well, I don't know if that got through, so.  All right, thanks.  He's saying if we play, we're sellouts.  I don't think so, because we're not going to sit here and go rah, rah, guns and roses,  finally, yay, yay, yay.  Yeah.  But how is it, that's a misuse of the word sellout.  People playing the song that, I'm curious to hear it.  Yeah, all right.  Uh, I don't want to hear it.  I'd rather listen to Foundry.  Oh, there's a good one.  That's Steve C.  Let's say hi to, uh, down the hall.  John the Trucker. 
[00:09:30]  John.  I just want to know what's wrong with the guns and roses we already got.  Uh, Mr. Brownstone.  Uh, what's some of those other guns and roses songs?  All right, nice shooting.  Welcome to the jungle.  Patience.  Use your illusion.  One and two.  November rain.  November rain.  November rain.  Have a time for discussion. 
[00:10:00]  You know what I'm saying.  Oh, yeah.  Watch it out, boys.  All right.  Thanks.  Uh, let's say hi to, uh, Eric in Indiana.  Daddy.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I kind of like that last caller.  I was going to say you should, uh, just play every other guns and roses song all morning long  and just keep using the new one.  Play an old one?  Yeah.  Say, here's the new one.  All right, we're going to play this, uh, this thing.  Get it out of the way so we can get to the funny in a few minutes here.  Oh, yeah?  I think so. 
[00:10:30]  Uh, Matt on Long Island.  How are you?  Can we just play it till the hook?  What's up, guys?  Yeah, no kidding.  Hey.  How are you?  What's up?  Yeah, don't play this song.  I'd rather hear Jimmy read from his book.  Well, Jimmy doesn't want to read from his book because he wants you to kind of buy the thing.  Yes, sir.  Do you have your book on tape?  All right, read the back of it, then.  Nobody wants to hear guns and roses.  Old men on stage.  I have, uh, Kenny's going to get a copy of Frank.  I can bring it.  Book on tape?  No.  Oh.  I haven't done those yet.  Oh, you haven't done any even with, uh, your first book?  Oh, that's done, but I...  You had to sit there and read the whole book? 
[00:11:00]  Three days.  Three days?  Oh, my God.  Holy jeez.  What if you mess up a word?  Oh, believe me.  She lets you know.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'll do it differently this time.  I'll do it more natural spoke.  There's a different...  Book on tape is a different world, man.  It was bizarre.  Yeah?  What do you got to, like, kind of...  You have to read.  The proper inflection during certain things?  A little differently than you would normally read.  You have to be a little clearer.  And she kept saying that's the way they are.  But I will never do it.  I'll do another one, of course, but I would want it to be more spoken word.  You should have got, like, Big A or somebody.  Believe me. 
[00:11:30]  I thought of that.  I'm serious.  Something different.  Would that be ridiculous?  Somebody with a horrendous voice.  Some poor blind bastards trying to get Jimmy's book.  And they hear...  I'm going to read the chapter titles.  Maybe I'll get Big A to read the chapter titles if I do it.  Yeah.  If it took you three days, if I did a book on tape, it would be a month easy.  Three days.  Three days.  Let's go back to the Guns N' Roses phones.  James in Canada.  How are you, James?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning. 
[00:12:00]  Good.  One comment about G&R.  Fuck.  It's yuck.  I don't know.  Let's go to Ken in Jersey.  Ken.  I think his phone crapped out when he wanted to say something.  Ken.  Hey.  Hey, Ken.  Yeah, what's up, Ken?  Nothing.  Does it count for the ten calls if we call in and say that they suck?  You don't like Guns N' Roses?  Could we get...  If ten people call in today don't want to hear, could you not play it?  Oh, that's not a bad idea.  We can do, like, a phone roulette.  Should we give it... 
[00:12:30]  Why don't we play it for, like, a few seconds and let people hear, like, the first 30 seconds  of it?  Yeah.  And then if they want to hear more, we'll play more.  Oh, there it is.  Well, there's good news, though.  Mike in Pennsylvania has the good news.  I won't blow up his spot.  Go Phillies, by the way.  The World Series.  I mean, you can just feel the excitement in the air.  The World Series starts today, and wow.  Wow.  I remember such anticipation when, like, when the Yankees are in there, after the playoffs  are over, the time between the playoffs and the World Series is, like, a big thing.  Yeah.  And then I hear on the news this morning, the World Series starts tonight, and I'm like, 
[00:13:00]  really?  I had no clue.  There's usually excitement when it's two, like, big teams.  Yeah.  But when one team's playing a minor league team, there's no excitement.  Yeah.  How can you have excitement over that?  No one cares.  Mike, how are you?  Hey, you're doing good, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  Hey, is there any truth or rumor that Dr. Pepper was going to give out a free Dr. Pepper  to everybody in the United States if GNR released their album this year?  That is true.  Really?  And I guess you could get a free Dr. Pepper online or something, right, Travis? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, because now that this is going to be released, and now everybody in America gets  a free Dr. Pepper.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Who wants Dr. Pepper?  Especially through the mail system.  I hated Dr. Pepper my whole life.  Stinks.  Yeah.  You have to run out and check your mail every day.  Dr. Pepper.  I want to be a pepper, too.  I'm a pepper.  You're a pepper.  I'm a pepper.  We're a pepper.  Let's say hi to Pete on Long Island.  Pete.  What's up, guys?  Listen, I've heard this. 
[00:14:00]  It's so bad, you'll get much more material out of playing it.  Jimmy, you'll joke on it all day.  Yeah.  It's pretty bad.  You should play it.  I don't like to make fun of other people's efforts.  The earnest effort of my betters.  You will.  You will, man.  It's pretty bad.  All right.  Well, you know what?  It's nice and early.  We don't do our good stuff right out of the box, so let's get this.  It's over with.  We don't.  It's all just jokes, people, in the end.  Dr. Pepper.  That's all we try to do is just jokes.  Guns and Roses, Chinese Democracy. 
[00:14:30]  Here it is.  The debut.  Pendulum was playing at the turn of attention.  Just another day, another conversation.  You had me.  Dude, you totally got me, son of a bitch.  You totally had me.  I honestly thought that that could have been it.  Who knows?  It was Pendulum. 
[00:15:00]  Someone's saying, I get it, Opie.  You hate everything.  That's not true.  I hate a lot less these days, but this Guns and Roses.  This Guns and Roses, thanks.  Thanks.  Well, we've got to play a little more Pendulum.  Come on.  This is Steve's old band, and we're having a contest.  People are remaking Pendulum, and this is the best entry so far.  Pendulum will swing at the turn of attention.  Just another day, another condescension. 
[00:15:30]  Mark, you shock, you're gonna lock you down.  Pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure.  It's too slow, and the pendulum will get you.  I'll show you more, you're gonna slow you around.  You need to grab another time, and now you're gonna pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I don't like to take a lot of screaming in my ear.  The act is gonna break.  If you push me one more time.  My butt's getting heavy, my butt's getting cold. 
[00:16:00]  You shake me into something that I can't control.  You see me come, let's get out of my way.  And your love is swinging like the other way.  My butt's getting heavy, my butt's getting cold.  You shake me into something that I can't control.  You see me come, let's get out of my way.  And your love is swinging like the other way.  The pendulum can take only so much yelling. 
[00:16:30]  What he's gonna do next, there's no telling.  If you're gonna bump your chump, you're gonna dump you out.  The pendulum will break under too much tension.  Breaking down the walls of my detention.  Wrecking ball and kingdom falling down.  You need to grab another time.  Now you're gonna pay for what you've done.  You better run.  And your love is coming into something that I can't control. 
[00:17:00]  You see me come, let's get out of my way.  And your love is swinging like the other way.  My heart's getting heavy, my butt's getting cold.  You shake me into something that I can't control.  You see me come, let's get out of my way.  And your love is swinging like the other way.  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold 
[00:17:30]  You change me into something that I can't control  If you see me coming, let's get out of my way  Cause your love is swinging back  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold  You change me into something that I can't control  If you see me coming, let's get out of my way  Cause your love is swinging back  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold  You change me into something that I can't control  If you see me coming, let's get out of my way  Cause your love is swinging back 
[00:18:00]  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold  Wow. There you go. That's just one of our listeners.  I was redoing Steve's Pendulum song  When he used to be in a band back, way back when  Yeah, way back when  His band was called Foundry  Yeah  And that song is Pendulum  I think it was around the same time Guns N' Roses was, you know 
[00:18:30]  Yeah  We're still together  And it's gotten more airplay  Yeah  Than Guns N' Roses  Yeah, I'd rather hear that than Chinese democracy  We gotta find the lounge version for everybody  Yeah, the lounge version is fantastic  We would play it right now, but E-Rock is not here today  Something with a water heater, blah, blah, blah  What happened? I'd love to know  So we're having a problem finding our stuff  Is he coming in?  No 
[00:19:00]  No, there's some problem with water here  That could be a real song  Yeah  It really could  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Josh, the trucker  How are you, Josh?  I'm doing great, guys  Good  Hey, I'm telling you  If I could go buy that in the store right now  I'd pay 20 bucks for it  Wow  For that song you just heard?

[00:19:30]  That is like a great version of a crap song  I know  Maybe we Steve  The lyrics is way better  Maybe we should get K-Rock here in New York to play it  Yeah  Why not?

[00:22:30]  Here's the hook of the original  It's going to be longer ago than that  My heart is here  I'm lucky to go  To change me into something that I'm just in control  You see me, girl  And let's get out of my way  There's a love is playing  And take me out of the way  See, now that other song we just played makes a lot of sense  Yeah  That's what that guy was working off  I will  Did an amazing job with it  I will tell you one thing, though  I cannot get the goddamn song out of my head 
[00:23:00]  Yeah  All day  Long  Walking around the house  All day long  Walking around the house  It's a catchy little ditty  Yeah  That's for sure  And we have a lot of different versions coming in  Yeah  This one blew us away yesterday  Might as well just, you know, redo the bit  We're in the middle of it now  Yeah  No turning back  We got a lounge version  Yeah, I like this one  A lot  Girl singing is just one of those typical sweet-voiced lounge singer girls 
[00:23:30]  Yeah  Music  Believe it or not  It's the same song  Pendulum will swing at the center of the tension  Just another day and now they're kind of sentient  Mock you, shock you, I'm gonna lock you down 
[00:24:00]  Starring Marky Post  Yeah  I'm gonna lock you down  As Steve Carly said  Pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure  Move too slow and the pendulum will get you  Don't let it get you  Throw you, mow you, I'm gonna throw you around  I'll bring it to you 
[00:24:30]  You did the crime  But not the time  And now you gotta pay  For what you've done  You better run  I've had all I can take of your screaming in my ear  My back is gonna break if you push me one more time  Don't  My heart's getting heavy  My blood's getting cold  You change me into something that I just can't control 
[00:25:00]  If you see me coming, best get out of my way  The pendulum is swinging back the other way  Opie and Anthony, Light FM  Isn't that a...  Swinging back  Swinging back  Swinging back  Yeah, there's a little taste of the lounge version that came in  So having a lot of fun with that dumb contest  But the rock version we played about ten minutes ago, just amazing  Really is just amazing  It was a good job  All right, I guess we're committed 
[00:25:30]  So we gotta play the new Guns N' Roses Chinese Democracy  We'll do that in a few minutes here for everybody  Nice tease  Well, we gotta tease a little  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  And just a quickie for New York  Remember those waterfalls?  Yeah, those dopey waterfalls  That we made fun of  Yeah  And just waterfalls they decided to create under a couple big huge bridges here in New York  It was scaffolding with water that was pouring off the top of it  It didn't look like a waterfall  It looked like some kind of sewage treatment plant 
[00:26:00]  Oh yeah, the one wasn't even part of a bridge  You're right  And then one was under what?  The Brooklyn Bridge?  Yeah  And we made fun of it?  Yeah  Well, we're dumb  Why?  The city made $69 million off those ridiculous waterfalls  I read that too  How did they figure that out?  We'll tell you next  Oh, ooh  Nice tease  We'll tell you as we play Guns N' Roses in the background  Let's just tease everything today  One big tease  And then at $8.55 we give the answers to everything really fast 
[00:26:30]  What a crappy show  I would listen to that every day  Here's Guns N' Roses  This is why they made $69 million  That would be an awful thing to do to our listeners  Eh, we gotta do something  Stay there  Opie and Anthony  Got a busy one today  Opie and Anthony  We're all excited for Jim Norton  He's got a book out called  I Hate Your Guts 
[00:27:00]  Well, you can pre-order the book  I Hate Your Guts  On Amazon  On Amazon  And it's the talk of the country, Jimmy  Our pal Don Imus was talking about it yesterday, I guess  Was he?  And E-Rock got the mention so we could play it on our show  And man, you gotta sit through a lot of crap to finally get to Imus talking about Jim Norton's book  You gotta sit through a jingle, his intro music  What is E-Rock thinking?  Just get to the plug  Wait, wait, you put E-Rock and thinking in the same sentence  Good point, good point 
[00:27:30]  Yeah  This is Imus eventually talking about Jim Norton's new book, I Hate Your Guts  Why, E-Rock?  Why would we need that?  Why would we need the plug for another station?

Yeah  But he  I disagree with you  Your point of view  Five past the hour  What's it called?

[00:31:30]  We're going to Google bomb the hell out of  I hate your guts Jim Norton  Google  And speaking of Google  Anthony has a little problem with the Google Maps  Will  I uh  I was looking at it  I noticed for a very long time  The Google  The Google Maps  Yeah  When you go to the satellite view  Uh  My house  You know you like looking at your house  On Google  I don't know why  It's like hey where's my house  Uh  And it was  The old house  That was there before they knocked it down  And built my house 
[00:32:00]  Uh huh  Uh  But  Recently I went there and went  Oh look  They updated it  There's my house  So I look  And then I noticed  You could  Pop right in front of it  On the street view  And uh  Drive  Pretty much drive  Virtually down my street  And there's my house  Zoom in on it  There's a car in the driveway  That  That's my house  Not only that  You could drive right into the driveway  Yeah  When you zoom in  You could pretty much 
[00:32:30]  See the license plate  Of the car in the driveway  Of that car  In the driveway  Uh  It's  It's just like  I don't know  I find it a little  Um  Invasive  But  You know  I'm not one of those  You know  Man  The man  Is trying to look  For me  Man  But they never tell you  When these are  Being done  You don't know  Have you ever seen  The Google Mobile  Driving around  Photographing things  It's like  At the street level  Dude  It's amazing 
[00:33:00]  They  They  Literally  Drive  A vehicle  With the camera  On the roof  And  And  Take pictures  So  It's like  It's just there  For everybody  To see  Uh  And  And I  I noticed  When I noticed that  I went  Let me see how really  Um  How uh  Uh  Prevalent this is  And  A lot of streets  They've mapped already  Like this  From street level  And I'm wondering  How  Like  How many people  Got caught  Doing things 
[00:33:30]  Or  Cause like I said  They're not  Hey we're Google  We're gonna be  Passing by  You know  Rake your yard  You know  Make it look nice  Taking a picture  You gotta assume  There's a website  Dedicates all the people  That got caught  Through Google Maps  Yeah  Apparently Danny says  Uh  That uh  There is a website  I would love to see that  Because  You gotta think  There's a guy  You know  Uh  Walking his mistress  Back to the car  Because the wife's at work  And you know  The stupid car drives by  At that moment  To take a picture  Of your house  It's  Apparently  They showed a Volkswagen  With a  Like a tripod 
[00:34:00]  On the roof  With a  A camera  On top  Could you see  Chasing the thing  Down the street  Going wait  Wait  Could you please  Pass by  And take another picture  Right  I'm not supposed  To be with her  Right  It's uh  I don't know  I just found it  Very weird  You could just  Zoom right in  On your house  That was something  That was just  Fantasy  Uh  Uh  Just a few years  Back  You get the  Google map  And then imagine  You know  Like Stunty said  There  What the government  Has  You know  If Google 
[00:34:30]  You go on the  Website  And you got that  Imagine what the  Government has  As far as street  Level stuff goes  And  Better camera  I'm sure everything's  Mapped  Every inch of this  Country is mapped  Already  You said that you  Could almost see the  License plate of the  Car in your driveway  Yeah  I'm sure the  Government version  Oh yeah  You could see the  License plate  The only reason you  Can't completely make  Out the license plate  Is because the car's  Pulled in the driveway  Pretty far  Yeah  Like  If the car was  Backed out of the  Driveway a little bit  You'd absolutely see 
[00:35:00]  The plate  It's a  It does seem a little  Invasive  I'm not sure if it's  Good bad or what  What is the necessity  Of the street view  By the way  Is it if you gotta  Get somewhere  You could look at  Landmarks  And go oh okay  That's the  Yeah that's the  Something I'm looking  For  I kind of  I'm answering my  Own question  But I kind of  Did do that  I was looking for  A place that  Cuts my hair  And I hadn't  Been there  And it was in  A Petco shopping  Center or something  So I went to  Street level to make  Sure that that was 
[00:35:30]  The right shopping  Center  And you go street  Level I saw  Petco  Yeah  Right  So it's kind of  It's so you're  So you're saying  You like it  It's convenient  Yeah now it's  Convenient but it's  Also  Doesn't work for you  No I'm not getting  My hair cut at  Petco  People are a little  Confused there  All right  Well I think people  Have some comments  About the Google  Mapping thing  The Google  Travis is taking  Your phone calls  Right now  In the meantime

[00:51:30]  Still does I guess  How long does this go?  I don't know but  We're not doing radio properly  We're never going to be invited  To the annual  Friends of Old Time  Radio Convention  Damn it  When is that?  Just want my invite  David Hinckley  Come on  Help us out  I want to meet  Pat St. John again  David Hinckley writes for  The Daily News  The radio section 
[00:52:00]  We are in the number one  Radio market in the world  Right?  Yes  New York is the number one  Radio market  You would never know it  By reading David Hinckley's  Radio column  No  It's a busy weekend  For serious radio fans  The annual  Friends of Old Time  Radio Convention  Kicks off tomorrow  In Newark  And runs through Sunday  Do you need that long?  Meanwhile  Meanwhile  WFMU's annual record fair  The major fundraiser  For that independent station 
[00:52:30]  Runs Friday through Sunday  Nothing else is going on  In radio  That's more important  Than that  Enough with the FMU  We've been doing  Does he own that place?  I don't know  We've been doing radio  In New York  Off and on for 10 years  I've never  Tuned in WFMU  No  But he's obsessed  With those independent stations  Alright  I just got a comment  On a poll  That I saw  There's a lot of polls  Coming out  Because of the election  And 
[00:53:00]  One is more ridiculous  Than the next  And  I saw  I saw one  And I don't even think  It was sarcastic  Or  As a joke  It said  85%  Of people  That are polled  Do not  Said they don't lie  In the polls  Now if you think  About that for a second  They could be lying  Which would  Totally blow that 
[00:53:30]  Poll result apart  It's like  I don't lie  On polls  Alright  We'll write you down  As don't lie  I totally lie  All the time  It was the dumbest poll  I ever saw  It was one of those  Poll questions  That like  Kirk would ask  An android  To blow his head up  One of those paradox  Questions that Kirk  Always used  But if you say  You don't lie  On the poll  And you're lying  It taints the poll  So we can't get  An accurate thing  But  If he's not lying  Then it's accurate 
[00:54:00]  And does not compute  Does not compute  And then you know  The enterprise warps out  You think they have  A follow up question  So were you lying  When you said  You don't lie  And then they're like  Alright you got me  So then how many  Of those people  It's like the people  Polled about the poll  If they lie  50% lied  Right  That they don't lie  And they said  They were being  Completely honest  This time  When they said  They lied  Right  Which would have to  Lead to another  Follow up question  I read that  And went like  How do you  Put a poll out 
[00:54:30]  Like that  Can't possibly  Be accurate  You know  You're talking  A little politics  Really fast  McCain  In a little trouble  This morning  What did he do now  He's just agreeing  With  God  What happened  Who's this  What happened  I don't know  Here's the story  John Murtha  Yeah thank you  It's a big story  Today  Western Pennsylvania  Is a racist area  When I say  A racist area  I mean  They  Older people  Are hesitant  You know  They slow  And  Seeing change

[00:55:30]  Into this  McCain apparently  Made a comment  About  Murtha's comments  Yesterday  Senator Obama's  Supporters have been  Saying some  Pretty nasty  Things about  Western Pennsylvania  Lately  And you know  I couldn't agree  With him more  I couldn't disagree  With you  I couldn't agree  With you more  Than the fact  That western  Pennsylvania  Is the most  Patriotic  What an idiot

[01:20:30]  What  He said  About  Gary  There's  One  Word  He  Would  Say  Wrong  The  New  York  I  Remember  That  I  Forget  What  The  Word  My  My  Do  You  Like  Any  Of  These  Guys  That's  Where  I'm  At  With  This  Whole  Thing  The  Four  That  Are  Left  No  You  Know  Me  I'm  You  Know  McCain  Is  Not  Republican  Enough  For  Me  And  We  All  Know  How  I  Feel  About  Obama  I  Just  You  Know  I  Say  Obama  Like  A  Likeable  I  Would  Rather  Have  A  Beer  With  Him  Than  A  Like  A  I 
[01:21:00]  I  Sorry  He  Could  Be  A  Little  More  Seasoned  And  I  Don't  Like  His  He  Really  Is  Kind  Of  A  European  Socialist  In  My  Opinion  It's  Amazing  Hey  You  Know  My  World  It'll  Be  Giuliani  With  Newt  Gingrich  Is  The  The  The  Giuliani  Is  You  Know  Can  We  Fit  David  Duke  In  No  Is  He  Running  That  Some  People  Say  I  Know  I  Know  That's  I  Get  That  All  The  Total  Exaggeration  Just  Cause  Silly  Me  I  Like  My  Second  Amendment  Silly  Me  But 
[01:21:30]  Obama  Seems  Like  A  Nice  Enough  Guy  A  Likeable  Guy  But  The  Fact  Is  His  Policies  I'm  Sure  The  French  Will  Love  This  Guy  They  Do  Over  There  All  The  Time  Germany  Oh  All  Europe  Is  Just  Loving  This  Guy  Because  He  Could  Be  Walked  All  Over  Absolutely  By  This  New  United  Europe  Until  Something  Happens  Until  The  Germans  Decide  To  Have  A  Little  Shindig  Again  Little  Fun  You're  Right  I like  Obama  I think 
[01:22:00]  He's  More  Radical  I  Think  And  I  Think  He  Reminds  Me  One  Of  Those  Black  Guys  That  You  See  That  They  Wear  Glasses  That  They  Don't  Need  To  Wear  Just  To  Look  Professorial  Yeah  I  Think  He's  A  Lot  More  Radical  Absolutely  Even  Though  To  Be  Honest  I  Want  Him  To  Win  But  I  Still  Think  He's  Now  Why  Jimmy  Why  Do  You  Want  Him  To  Win  Just  I  Just  Want  Him  More  Than  McCain  Because  Of 
[01:22:30]  Bush  He's  Going  Appointed  How  Many  Did  Bush  Appoint  Three  Or  Two  Two  Two  Alito  What  Happened  During  That  Time  That  Really  Screwed  Things  Up  Conservatively  I  Mean  Did  We  The  Only  Thing  I  Could  Say  Is  I  Hate  His  Take  And

[01:23:30]  Those  Are  Things  Where  People  Panic  But  You  Start  Getting  Some  Real  Liberals  On  The  Supreme  Court  And  Now  You're  Looking  At  A  Lot  Of  Our  Constitutional  Rights  Being  Taken  Away  They  Legislate  They  Don't  Interpret  Legislate  I  Don't  Know  If  Too  Many  Maybe  I'm  Wrong  Here  But  I  Don't  See  Too  Many  Conservative  Judges  I'm  Just  Talking  About  Supreme  Court  Wise  At  Any  Level  Interpreting  The  Law  Like  They  Do  The  Ninth  Court  Of  Appeals  In  San  Francisco  They  Just 
[01:24:00]  Do  Anything  They  Whatever  The  Oh  My  God  Are  They  You  Whatever  They  They  Are  Looking  At  Making  Prostitution  Illegal  It  Won't  Pass  But  Why  Don't  You  Think  It  Will  Pass  In  San  Francisco  No  It  Won't  Pass  Don't  They  Have  Enough  AIDS  Over  There  Even  In  Berkeley  They're  All  Against  It  You  Can  Never  Have  Enough  Right  What  Is  Unbelable  Over  There  They  Should  Take  Little  Kids  To  Lesbian  Weddings

[01:28:00]  Fact  By  The  Way  That  Obama  Will  Talk  I  Get  Tired  Of  This  Policy  We  Have  Not  Talking  To  Iran  Not  Talking  To  Syria  Because  We  Don't  Like  Yeah  That  One  Doesn't  Bother  Me  That  Much  I  Want  I  Want  To  I  Don't  Care  If  They're  Radicals  I  Just  Want  To  You  Got  To  Talk  But  You  Also  Have  To  Back  It  Up  Yeah  With  Don't  Step  On  Me  Now  Don't  Like  I  I'm  Going  To  Go  Here  And  I'm  Going  To  Talk  We're  Going  To  Have  A  Dialogue  But  The  Second  You  Start  Spouting  Off  Your  Crazy  Muslim

[01:55:30]  If you have to ask that  Yeah his father had to drive  Into the hospital in New York  Like laying on his back  Just to hold the thing  On his eye  The best thing I ever saw  Was that kid  That nine  Nine year old kid  Gets shot  That was something  Down the middle of the desert  His father  What?  He saw it?  What?  We used to go out  To the Mojave Desert  With my father  Out of his mind  And we all used to go out  And camp  At this silver mine  This all abandoned silver mine  In the Mojave Desert  It was like  50 miles  Off the highway 
[01:56:00]  And the highway  Was in the middle of nowhere  Between like Needles  And Kingston, Arizona  Or something  In the middle of nowhere  No sunblock  Yeah it was just nothing  And we took guns  And doom buggies  And just  And we were kids  And just  Here go ahead  Here are the keys  Take it out  Shoot stuff  We're just driving around  The desert  Shooting things  It was insanity  And this guy  Juan  Juan Reyes  He went out  And he had this old  Six shooter  That you used to have  To quarter cock  To move the 
[01:56:30]  The cylinder  So he quarter cocks it  Loads it  Shuts the gate  Lifts it up  And the quarter cock  Hit one of the bullets  And his son  Nine year old son  Standing right in front of him  Hit him  Right  In the  Shoulder  The left shoulder  And out his shoulder blade  But I thought it was a hard shot  It looked exactly like  And then blood came out  In a tube  It looked like  A clear tube  Was stuck in 
[01:57:00]  And blood was pumping out  Through it  It was that round  And he just went like  He turned white  Went  And boom  Fell on the ground  And I'm just like  Holy  Jesus  I just watched  One of my friends  Get killed  And they had to  Throw him in the truck  In one of the pickup trucks  And drive him to the hospital  In like Arizona  Was the closest thing  It was maybe  A couple hundred miles away  Packed in ice  And all kinds of  Shirts and everything on there  And we were  They left all of us there 
[01:57:30]  All the adults went  So they left the kids there  And then the cops showed up  Because it was a gunshot  So they got out to investigate  And they showed up  With their guns drawn  Like thinking  The Manson family  Is out there  And it's a bunch of us  Kids all armed  And the cops  Are asking questions  Like what are you doing out here  It's like road warrior  It was like the road warrior  Throwing a boomerang  And catching it  And your fingers  Getting lopped off  It was crazy  I'm doing shots of tequila  It was  And I was probably  Six  Fourteen  Yes  I was six years old  Nice boy  Shot in the shoulder

[01:58:30]  When I first  When I was living in New York  And growing up  I was the mama's boy  I was always  When I was telling  I was crying all the time  I was a big baby kid  Just meh  And you know  I was a little mommy's boy  And I'd stay home  And build models  Of dinosaurs  And spaceships  And things like that  And then when I went out  To California  I saw this whole new way of life  It was called  Getting laid  My brother was out there  So smoking weed  Shooting stuff  Riding  Drinking  Riding horses  You could have done that  In Levittown  Yeah exactly 
[01:59:00]  When after he went to California  That's when you said  To your liver  Put up your duke  This is going to be  A tough one  And I can see  That incident  Really scared you  Away from guns  Jesus  Yeah I know  I can't get enough of them  I love them  It was absolutely  The most unsafe thing  That could have been done  You never  When you have one of these  Old six shooters  You're supposed to leave  One of the chambers  Empty  So that the  Because the  The firing pin  Is on the hammer  Itself  So the hammer falls  It's going  It's going to hit the primer 
[01:59:30]  Yeah that's the one  You want to be playing  Around kids  Yeah around kids  You look at it wrong  And it goes up  It goes up  Exactly  Now there's a lot  Of safety devices  In the guns  That keep the firing pin  Separate from the hammer  Until the trigger's pulled  Or you're holding something  On the grip  A lot of safety's in place  Amazing  It was  Yeah it was quite a  Quite a weekend  I almost died  Quite a childhood  Yeah  We're having a rock fight  Me and Robbie Sear  Jesus  The old rock fight

[02:00:30]  Puts it back  Proceeds to shoot  Hits me right in the throat  I think about this today  I get chills up my eyes  It would have went right through me  And killed me instantly  You'd have been dead  I caught the thing like this  With my fist  But it still cut my throat  Of course it did  It's like a pencil now  But can you imagine  If you caught it  Yeah with my fist  I pinned it against my throat  Can you imagine  If you didn't take the tip off  You'd have been so dead  I'd have been like  William Tell  Right through my head  You'd have been dead  I keep thinking about that  To this day 
[02:01:00]  Wow  It freaks me out  I mean  Wow  Perfect shot  That is something  Right across the street  Would you die from a shot like that  Hell yeah  And the throat  Arrow to the throat  Probably  Just talk like Colin  Yeah I'm Nick DiBolo  This guy used to know  This guy I actually still know  This guy Randy used to  Talk about how he was playing  With a bunch of his friends  Outside  And they would play  With bow and arrow  What they would do is  Take it and point it  Straight up  Shoot it  Oh I got a surprise  And then no one would know  Where it's coming down  So they'd all panic 
[02:01:30]  And go  Holy Jesus  And then  It would hit the lawn  Next to someone  And they'd all laugh  So  They were doing this for a while  And one kid does it  And there's a woman  Gardening across the street  She's on her knees  Bent over  Doing some gardening  They don't know where the arrow is  All of a sudden  They hear  Ah  And it went right through  The middle of her calf  And stuck into the ground  And  And she's screaming  So they all just  Run for their life  They ran away

[02:11:00]  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  We're going to feature a pendulum song.  Nice.  As we, you know, go from one studio to the other, whatever.  But there you go.  There's today's, the 8-bit pendulum song.  Nick DePaulo made the walk.  Of course.  Also, Robert Kelly, who's playing the Wilbur Theater in Boston.  Whoopi, Friday night.  Whoopi, Friday night, one show only.  A very nice opportunity to see Bobby and what he's doing on a stage lately.  And I walked in, you guys were saying that Al-Qaeda officially endorsed McCain. 
[02:12:00]  Is backing McCain, yes.  Al-Qaeda on one of their fine websites that usually show things, you know, beheadings or whatever, other shenanigans they want to pull against Americans.  And they posted that they are backing John McCain for president of the United States.  And who's buying this little, this clever ruse that they're trying to pull?  But this scares me.  Does America understand what they're doing by... 
[02:12:30]  And then they'd go, well, if Al-Qaeda's backing him, I don't want to vote for him.  Like, are you that stupid?  Or do you see the fact that they're doing it so he, you know, loses because they really do want Obama in.  Right.  Because they think he's a softy.  They see him as sort of a brethren, I think.  Keith Olbermann sent that email to MSNBC.  Get on that guy's dead side.  Oh, you like Keith?  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Yeah.  Doesn't he do ESPN, too?  I hope he finds a lump on his left nut and it spreads to his pussy.  That's a damn good one. 
[02:13:00]  Do you like Bill O'Reilly?  Yes, I do.  Sometimes.  He's a blowhard.  Here's what I like about O'Reilly's show.  He loves himself.  He is a blowhard at times.  But at least he exposed New York Times and those other douches.  He does that very well.  Did you see the argument he got in with Barney Frank?  Yes.  Oh, is that great?  Barney Frank, does he have teeth?  Have they all been knocked out from teabagging pages?  His mouth is in a permanent frown at the corners from sucking so many cocks. 
[02:13:30]  His mouth does.  He goes to the end.  He's got the weirdest mouth.  Oh, God.  O'Reilly beat, yelling at him like he's his dad.  Fucking old queen.  And Frank just stood there, though.  Yeah, he did.  Barney hung in there just like, you know.  You know what?  Barney's so used to the abuse.  Well, Barney Frank's on this right after the economic meltdown at Wall Street.  And Barney Frank had a lot to do with it, you know, with Fannie Mae.  He was in charge of it and didn't do shit.  He loves anything with Fannie in it.  Yes, of course.  And he's pointing fingers at everybody else.  He wouldn't say, yes, I'm a little culpable. 
[02:14:00]  Like, you know.  Sure.  Wouldn't do it.  Pointing his fingers at everybody else.  And O'Reilly was right on the money there.  Yeah.  Do we have that?  Yelling at him like he was the little fruitcake that he is.  It should be easy to find.  I know it's on YouTube.  I enjoy it.  It's all over the place.  But it is good because O'Reilly's yelling like your dad.  Like, just yelling like your fucking dad yelled at you.  What the fuck?  What are you talking about?  You don't even know what.  Whoa, shit.  I cowered in the corner crying.  It was fun.  It was good.  Don't make me get the belt. 
[02:14:30]  His hand was shaking.  Belt and a strap on.  Whatever else he needs.  They actually got the name of the company from Barney.  It was Fannie.  May I put my cock in it?  And they had to edit it down.  Shorten it, you know.  Of course.  Of course.  And they went, Fannie's a girl's name.  He likes boys.  Okay, Freddie Mac.  Yeah, forgive me, Freddie Mac.  No, he was listing men he's fucked in the bottom.  It was Freddie Mac, Teddy Steve, and they just said, that's too long.  Again, shorten it again.  Of course.  Go for the joke twice.  Jimmy, two jokes. 
[02:15:00]  Jimmy, two jokes.  Shorten the name.  Shorten the name.  I'm going to go look at the funny papers.  The funny papers.  Exactly.  I'm going to wreck the bit.  Wreck the bit.  We get it, he's gay.  We get it, he's gay.  Who's the distractingly attractive girl we have to look at?  Patty?  It's very hard to, yes, Patty.  Oh.  It's very hard to do a show when that's in your lineup.  That's Ronnie Frank behind her.  Oh.  Line of sight.  That's Betty Longlaces.  Yeah, it's going to take a while to lace those up.  Oh, mighty.  Who are you? 
[02:15:30]  It takes her to kick her out of the bedroom.  I know.  They're like high top boot, they're boot sneakers.  She's got Caligula sneakers on.  Yeah.  Half sneaker, half corset.  We've got a mic on her.  She's lovely.  She's wrestling.  Hi.  Who are you?  Angel.  Hi, Angel.  Angel.  Is that your real name?  Yeah, I was born premature and they didn't think I was going to make it, so they need  me, Angel.  Angel?  Why didn't they call you skinny?  Preemie.  Yeah.  How premature were you?  Eight months.  Depends.  I mean, was it like a couple days?  It was a head and a clit on the blanket. 
[02:16:00]  I think it was about three weeks, I said.  Wow.  Yeah, I was born with a heart murmur.  It took 18 years to see her.  Oh, damn.  She's a good employee.  She's probably always outside waiting for the place to open.  Yeah, it's always early.  Say it twice.  Oh, yeah.  Who's the big cop looking guy with you?  That's her boyfriend.  I'm Colin, her boyfriend.  Okay.  God damn it.  Colin, go get us some sandwiches.  We were all hoping for brother.  How long have you been going together?  Shit.  Maybe it is.  How long have you been going together?  Where are you from?  Not too long. 
[02:16:30]  About six months now.  Oh, okay.  We can still try.  Yeah, but.  We can fuck that up.  We can still get in there.  But the thing is, good enough, because she's not that attached to him, but the bad part  is she's not sick of him either.  Yeah, yeah.  Because Colin probably, look, Colin is at six straight.  His dicky qualities haven't come out yet.  Oh, uh, that could differ.  Some of his douchey qualities.  She's like, what an asshole he is.  He's probably inconsiderate.  Oh, no, it's been showing a lot more.  I'm cock blocking the fuck out of this.  So we're trying to get over that.  Yeah.  What do you do for work, Angel?  Should I ask?  I do modeling.  Do you have a stage name?  Modeling.  Do you have a stage name? 
[02:17:00]  No.  What do you model?  Don't fucking insult the girl like that, you asshole.  Why is that an insult?  Fuck you.  Don't even pay attention to him.  What did you say, Bob?  One down.  Are you throwing me on the bus, you fucking cocksucker?  One down.  What did you say?  Jimmy's the hard one.  Jimmy's going to be the hard one to knock out of this equation.  We're battling.  He asked her, does she have a stage name?  So that gets him out of the fucking picture with his stupid remark.  So your model?  No, you meant she does theater, right?  Yeah.  You said stage name.  I thought she was in Greece. 
[02:17:30]  Of course.  What do you model?  Thank you, Nick.  You good clothing or?  I've actually done a lot of different stuff.  I've done stuff with Echo Red, League Avenue.  I don't know if anyone's heard of it.  Sexygirlstore.com.  It's like a lingerie.  Oh, jeez.  Lingerie.  Okay.  Do you ever date a black guy?  No.  Why is that a thing?  Anthony's in.  Jesus.  That question always gives me butterflies.  Can I see if she's smoking Newports?  I'm staying quiet on this one.  She's only 22, Anthony.  Yes, inconsiderate guy? 
[02:18:00]  What?  She's only 22.  Anthony said yes, inconsiderate guy.  22?  Are you trying to turn me off?  How old are you?  How old are you?  I'm 24.  That's disgusting.  Jesus Christ.  Date someone your own age, Colin.  24.  Kids all cocked to it.  How did you get a fucking model?  What was that?  How did he get a model?  What did you do?  How did he get a meat?  I don't know.  She doesn't go for looks, obviously.  You sound real intelligent.  That's great.  I look like fucking Jimmy in the mid-90s. 
[02:18:30]  You know?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that bombed.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, I know.  What are you attacking?  I'm being very aggressive.  I don't have much time here.  We're fucking, you know.  The show's going to be over an hour and a half, and I've got to impress this girl.  Yeah, help me out here.  What the fuck, Henry?  I'm trying to have a lot of brud.  I'm trying to bang this brud.  It's a big fucking score.  Help me out here, Henry.  He's from the four towns.  What the fuck's the matter here?  I'm always doing you famous.  I'm teasing.  You're a lovely couple.  All right.  Let me help you.  This is how you do it.  All right.  This is how you do it.  All right.  Colin, where are you from? 
[02:19:00]  I'm from Upstate, Cornwall, New York.  Ah, sorry about the AIDS.  So, Angel, what are you doing later?  See, that's all you do.  You knock the guy down, and the girl comes to you.  Right.  Pete, that's something.  Where did you meet?  How did you hook up?  He actually was kind of stalking my MySpace page.  We met through one of his exes.  Oh, boy.  And the big question, what does he do for a living? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, go on.  I work for Audi.  I sell Audis.  I'm a car salesman.  There you go.  You're a car salesman?  That's the worst time to be a car salesman.  Just a sleazy fucking car salesman?  Yeah, but it's an Audi.  I'll put that true coat on there for you.  What do you think about the true coat?  That's my deal, Wade.  Will you blow me if I have it z-barded?  Oh, you work at an Audi dealership.  All right.  Not even a Porsche.  Jesus.  Not selling many cars these days, right? 
[02:20:00]  Who's that?  Oh, my God.  Not selling many cars these days.  And she just went, no.  No.  Like, oh, fuck.  I didn't feel like that.  Yeah, I mean, the economy's shit.  Of course not.  Yeah.  Well, for some people.  The economy's shit?  I'm doing great.  What the fuck?  Am I missing something?  Rolling in the dough.  Do you live together?  I've been selling coke to school children.  No, you don't live together?  No.  Nice.  We spend a lot of nights together.  Whose place?  His or yours?  His.  Yeah, where are you unsatisfied?  My parents would not really approve.  You live with your parents?  You should go to the Capri Inn by the airport of LaGuardia. 
[02:20:30]  Beautiful place.  Nice.  Yeah, your family likes this guy?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  What, do you get him a deal on an Audi?  No.  No.  Who's that creepy tech guy sitting behind you?  Is he a chaperone?  No.  That guy's by himself.  The guy that keeps smelling the back of your hair.  Who is that guy?  Yeah.  Hey, Angel, they want your MySpace page.  Do you want to give it out or no?  Um, yeah, I guess.  What, do you have to be like a friend in order to post shit?  Well, you know what the funny thing is? 
[02:21:00]  Look at something.  Well, I have to accept you as a friend.  Yeah.  All right.  Can we look at pictures, though?  Any lingerie on there?  Yeah, you're a model.  All right.  Punch that up, Danny.  You're not fast enough.  But it's private.  I have to accept you.  Well, I can accept you.  Oh, shit.  Accept this.  My left nut.  You have to accept.  Joking.  You have to accept before you can even look at it.  It's one of those.  Ann, what do you think of that?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  All right.  Some pink lingerie.  That's a nice little pink lingerie.  She's quite a looker. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  She's got a nice belly.  I say hubba hubba.  Wait.  Where the hell did you get that from?  We get everything.  Yeah, that's definitely.  That's Photoshopped.  Hey, don't you worry.  We know how to get everything.  What's that hanging off your belly button?  We're like the FBI in this fucker.  We're amazing.  Danny can find anything.  How old is she?  Well, I'd say Danny.  22.  Wow.  Yeah, if you don't have a nice body, you're 22.  That's a nice picture.  That's you.  Holy shit.  That's a beautiful body.  That's nice.  Wow.  What side are you guys on? 
[02:22:00]  I don't know.  Are you going to be on a calendar in an Exxon station bathroom?  I was on a calendar.  I was a 2007 Rogo girl.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Calendar.  What month?  All.  Every month?  Yeah.  Every month?  Oh, that's good.  Wow.  I think I saw that.  You don't have to give thumbs up there, fella.  We know.  You're doing good.  Whoa!  That's you under some sheets with your legs sticking out.  Are those?  What's the threat count on those sheets?  Are those sateens?  Sateens? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, shit.  Poor audience.  Can't see because I only have one camera today.  They could visualize it on their own.  Not a shame.  Um, feel free not to post those up.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Fucking camera.  The one where she's...  What?  Oh, with mood.  Wait, wait.  Which one?  Turn it around.  Be nice.  No, not this one.  Oh.  Wow.  Why not that one?  That one's fantastic.  Nice.  Nice ass.  Let me see that there.  Thank you, nice lady.  Wow. 
[02:23:00]  Damn.  You do any full nudes?  No.  No?  No.  Never?  Never?  No, no, no, no.  Which means no.  Never did a full nude ever.  I want to have kids one day, and I don't think mommy's vagina out in the open would be...  No.  You'd be surprised.  Just go, that's where you came from.  Yeah, exactly.  You should do a calendar of just taint shots.  They say always remember where you came from, so...  Wait a minute.  The fire one with the suspenders.  Wow.  Yeah, that's the best one so far.  Dude.  Miss, how is that going to protect you in a fire? 
[02:23:30]  You're both inside me.  Miss.  Literal gym.  No, that was after I put the fire out.  Oh.  You've got to cool off a little.  You've got to put the fire out by lactating?  What was the shield on the helmet for?  Jizz?  Oh, Bob.  Bob, baby.  Come on.  You're always going to take it there, Bob.  I fucking respect the girls doing nice artistic shots.  It's take it too far, Bob.  That's my new character.  Bob, wow.  Oh, Bob.  Nice ribs.  There you go.  I like that one.  Nice ribs.  I like that. 
[02:24:00]  Like a greyhound.  I did that for FHM.  Really?  Yeah, that's a...  That was three years ago?  That's a good picture.  See that?  Three years ago?  Let me do a little math.  He's 19.  Row.  What do you look like now?  I mean, you've got a lot of stuff on.  You've got a bunch of...  I mean, do you still model right now?  Yeah, not as much because of this one.  Let a strip of pulp.  Oh.  What do you look like?  Can we look at you right now a little bit?  Oh, Bob.  Don't be so fresh with what she said.  No, no.  Especially after how nasty.  See, Bobby, you fucked it all up.  I was talking to the guy behind you, honey. 
[02:24:30]  She goes, especially because of how nasty you've been.  You have been very nasty, Bob.  You are just nasty.  What do you mean?  You're like her boyfriend.  You don't treat her nice.  That's a good one.  Exactly.  Appreciating her enough.  Next thing you know, you're going to be selling Audis, Bob.  I know.  What do you mean next thing?  I'm selling Azuzu pups.  He's getting very ugly chicks.  Is that new artwork on your arm?  Yeah.  There's a fish on your arm.  I see.  It's swimming. 
[02:25:00]  That's pretty fancy.  Yeah, that is.  A koi.  Thank you.  Everyone gets a koi.  You want deadliest catch next week?  You got any tats or you...  Fucking nicks.  Me?  Yeah.  That's a nice piece of work.  I just have this one.  Just one on your wrist.  What is it of?  It's a kanji symbol for music.  Oh.  Musical, I guess.  No, I just love music.  Oh, really?  What kind of music do you like?  Primarily what I listen to.  Big band?  Do you like big band?  It's screamo metal.  Oh. 
[02:25:30]  That's hot.  Oh, like emo screaming.  Screamo.  That's not going to sound good coming out of an Audi.  What's a screamo metal?  What is an example of that?  It's like when...  Have you heard of like Bullet for My Valentine?  A true?  Oh, I love those fuckers.  No.  I don't think so.  How about Ted Danson behind you?  Has he heard of it?  Ted Danson.  Who does that guy look like?  Yeah, he does look like somebody.  I can't figure it out, but...  Who have you been told you look like, sir?  Well, one time you told me I look like Captain Kangaroo four years ago, 
[02:26:00]  but that's a long time.  Jesus, Jesus.  By the way, he must have lost some weight.  He found a kangaroo.  About 200 pounds.  You lost a lot of weight.  About 200 pounds.  Oh, shit.  Good for you.  Come on in here.  Show us your stretch marks.  God bless.  Oh, thank you.  No, huh?  No.  I'll stay out here this time.  Can you like fly like a bat?  Almost.  Very close.  That skin is a bitch.  That's old Charlie Cheswick scar.  Yeah.  He lives in movie world.  I like Jimmy.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:26:30]  Well, very nice to meet you, Angel and Inconsiderate Guy.  Well, ask her if you got a shot.  Did he get you an Audi?  What was that?  Did he get you an Audi?  No.  Does he drive an Audi?  If, let's say.  Does he have an Audi?  Hold on.  Hypothetical situation.  If he was out of the picture and you were completely single,  would you at least go out to dinner or something with me?  With you?  Yeah.  Perhaps.  All right.  I'll take a perhaps. 
[02:27:00]  Do you like Arby's?  Oh, I love Arby's.  There you go.  No, it would be a nice place.  It's where, apparently, where Jill thought I took all my whores, as she put it,  when she circled my American Express bill and every restaurant and said,  is this where you took your whore?  It was Chuck E. Cheese.  Let's hear it.  They love the ball pit.  Oh, yeah, they do.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  This Nick was a cute kid.  I got something for Angel. 
[02:27:30]  Angel, this is how it works, by the way.  Make an excuse within the next hour and a half to go to the bathroom by yourself  and leave your number in one of the stalls if you're serious about Anthony's offer.  That's how it works.  I never check the stalls.  Steve does.  Steve, I check them all.  I even found another number.  Oh, don't worry, guy, Audi guy.  Look, he's getting all bombed.  He's like, what the fuck, dudes?  It's not like I have a few thousand in my pocket.  I do, but...  Audi dealer versus a radio show host.  That's okay. 
[02:28:00]  You want me to buy an Audi right now just to make him feel better?  Make it even.  Yeah.  That would be nice.  So she made another tattoo.  You'd be helping the economy, mister.  Yeah.  All right.  It's got a big trunk and some duct tape and a hammer.  I want to buy a brown Volkswagen with the passenger seat removed that comes with handcuffs and  a fake cast and Florida plates.  Yeah.  You're a serial killer hack.  That's right.  Come up with your own gimmick.  I know. 
[02:28:30]  I'm fucking...  You've got to use the van.  Yeah.  It's a very Ted Bundy-ish.  Yes.  Just a bit.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  She's just driving down the road.  She's just going home.  Feed the cat.  Take home some groceries.  So you don't know fucking Buffalo Bill's waiting with a fake cast?  A couch?  Anthony, I got a question.  I'm wondering if Ted the serial killer's here today.  I don't know.  He might be.  I'm looking around to see if Ted the...  Ted.  The serial killer.  Ted Bundy or Ted...  No, Ted the serial killer. 
[02:29:00]  The serial killer.  Ted Bundy stole my thunder.  Oh, Ted.  Hey.  Yes.  Ted the serial killer, everyone.  I was a serial killer.  I would blow smoke in people's faces and I'd kill them slowly with my secondhand smoke.  I'm responsible for many deaths.  I would kill them and they would turn into ghosts. 
[02:29:30]  Ghosts.  Ghosts.  That's very hard to say.  It certainly is.  It's like breasts.  Yes.  Breasts.  Plural life.  She has lovely breasts.  Hey, Ted.  Do you have any trophies?  You have any trophies?  Unless you're watching Xanadu.  Wow.  You have any trophies from your killings at home there, Ted the serial killer?  Yes, I do.  I would always save the right sock. 
[02:30:00]  Why the right sock?  I don't know.  I couldn't improv anything better than that, Gregory.  I agree.  I had a little collection.  I would save everything but the feet.  I would put it in my closet and it would start to smell.  I told Mother I went duty of the rug again.  Still live with Mother?  I certainly do.  Mother's infirm. 
[02:30:30]  She's an invalid.  Yes.  I put fish food in her mouth and then I rape her.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  Why wouldn't I?  That's the question.  Is she alive, Ted?  I think so, yes.  She always goes, get off me, Ted.  Oh, that's horrible with the fish food breath.  Yes.  It's really a turn off, Anthony.  Do you just sprinkle a pinch?  You don't want to overfeed, Mother.  Yes.  She sticks her tongue out stupidly. 
[02:31:00]  Fucking real.  All right.  God damn real.  You lost a lot of weight, Robert.  Thanks, Ted.  You're welcome.  I didn't know you.  Shut up.  Why does he have to look all the way up when he does Ted?  He almost has that look.  Okay.  He's almost got the look of the major from Platoon a little bit.  That has to, you know, drop ball ordinance on my paws. 
[02:31:30]  Lovely fucking war.  Yeah, lovely fucking war.  Hey, uh.  You've got that look going a little bit now that you lost the weight.  I'm sorry we went down this road, but now we've got questions for Ted the Serial Killer.  We've got Alan in Arkansas.  Alan.  Yeah, Ted, where might I find somewhere to buy ether rags and rope handcuffs, maybe a shovel?  You can go to TedSerialKillingParaphernalia.com.  The Emporium was shut down by the federal authorities.  But I saw all sorts of things. 
[02:32:00]  I saw medieval maces.  I saw anvils.  Wait, what's the place called?  I mean, the website.  He's not going to remember.  Ted SerialKillingParaphernalia.com.  Oh, no, it's .org.  Paraphernalia.  Just to throw everybody off, right?  Yes, the Chinese people are cybersquatting.com.  There's an ad for tiny genital improvement.  Ted, people want to know how many kills do you have? 
[02:32:30]  1,475, but only one is confirmed.  I'm making the assumption, because I one time blew smoke into a crowd.  And you hoped that would, like, kill them all?  Yes, very slowly.  Let's go to Mongo the Trucker.  A question for Ted SerialKiller.  Oh!  He's a second-hand smoke serial killer.  Yes, I'm a second-hand smoke serial killer.  So he blows smoke and hopes years from now they die.  I keep trophies.  I keep the butts that I've killed my victims with. 
[02:33:00]  And I masturbate over them.  I run the cigarette butt over my nipples and genitals, and I masturbate angrily.  That is the worst serial killer idea ever.  No, it's not.  It's very good.  Second-hand smoke?  I've killed many.  Does mother watch you masturbate?  She has no choice.  It's a studio apartment.  She doesn't like to look, but I have mirrors around her head.  She can't avoid it.  Wait, I think you said mirrors properly. 
[02:33:30]  Yes, I did mirrors.  Isn't it mirrors?  No, it's mirrors.  There's three R's.  All good words have three R's.  Let's go to Mongo the Trucker.  Mongo.  Oh, better than Mongo the Lloyd.  Ted, I had a date last night, and I have a great big fat chick in my sleeper.  What's the best way to dispose of her?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  I wish I had something planned for this.  You have a big fat girl where?  She's tied up in my sleeper. 
[02:34:00]  Well, then why don't you just open up the back and push her out, sir?  What kind of comedic gold do you expect from that shitty setup?  She's got a fat girl tied up.  That's kind of the punchline, isn't it?  Jimmy the Trucker from Ted the Serial Killer.  Yes.  Hey, guys.  I want to know if Ted rents out vans and couches.  Yes, one time I rented a van, but there was a little boy shoe in it,  and a judge sent a bunch of killers after me, so I had to return it.  Too obscure?  Sorry, I just called the Star Chamber. 
[02:34:30]  It was a bloody baby shoe.  Dude, I just had to read somebody printing Mongo the Lloyd.  I wasn't sure of it until I read it, and then I got it.  Holy shit.  You didn't get that?  No.  It's highbrow humor.  Hey, this is a very good question.  Ted, we got a very good question coming in. 
[02:35:00]  Someone wants to know what you did to Frank the Frowner.  Yes, people compare us, but Frank's a cunt.  He's always complaining about how it takes more muscles to frown or to smile.  Who gives a shit?  That trite asshole.  Did he kill Frank the Frowner?  No, I don't like Frank the Frowner.  He made a couple of appearances, and then somebody forgot to keep the same name,  so they became someone else.  Taking us inside.  Yes. 
[02:35:30]  What's on our little plate?  Nothing.  Nothing.  No, I know there is.  We can do what's the haps.  See, I want to know what's the haps.  I know our pal, Sam, gathered some audio from the new Google phone also.  He's done that.  I mean, there are quite a few things.  The news were caught with their pants down today.  Oh.  They had it all planned to be where?  In Times Square? 
[02:36:00]  Times Square at the T-Mobile store, I think, right?  That was selling the Google phone for the first time today?  The new Google phone, which is supposed to be the iPhone killer, just like many other  phones that have come by in the past.  Yeah.  And something tells me, well, Apple is celebrating the sale of their 10 millionth iPhone three  months early.  There was lines.  Seriously?  Yeah.  There were lines down the block at the Apple store, about two blocks, for people to get 
[02:36:30]  in and buy the iPhones.  There's lines everywhere to get an upgrade.  It's insane.  So I guess they figured now with this Google phone sweeping the nation, that there would  be a line out in front of the T-Mobile store.  And there was.  There was a line out there, right?  There sure was.  Yeah.  Sam went down there to do some.  What's the haps?  The press was down there.  You know, just getting interviews with people on the line.  How many?  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  The whole thing was very exciting in Times Square.  I guess.  Normally, at like five or six in the morning, Times Square is very quiet.  You know, people are just sort of trying to get to work and start their big day.  You can just hear the hookers sucking.  Yeah.  Oh, that was the 70s.  Just dripping out their ass.  But today, I mean, with all the excitement, everybody was lined up out in front of the  T-Mobile store.  Yeah.  And Tamsyn Fadal herself.  No.  Yeah.  Tamsyn Fadal?  Yeah.  Wait, in person? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  We got a great bit going with her, but I think it's way too inside, but whatever.  Who is it?  She beat up her man once live during one of her reports.  It was a report.  Now, every time we see her on TV, we kind of reference that.  They were doing a little report on the news about Sex and the City, the movie, and she  got on and said, yeah, I'm going.  I'm going to see it.  Oh, I know who you're talking about.  Yeah.  But the angle.  I'm bringing my boyfriend with me.  And she goes, yeah.  And she goes, he's going.  He's going.  Believe me.  Like, this castrating fucking shit. 
[02:38:00]  And so now, every time she does a story, oh, because, oh, but my husband's not going  to be down here at the T-Mobile store.  I said, no.  And it's just us laughing in the office at her being emasculating.  Yeah.  To her man.  Yeah.  Because the story was about how just mostly women are going to the movie.  I think I was there for that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So, Sam.  Yeah.  Let's just open our food and enjoy the listeners.  I love it.  Then what happened?  I haven't been doing radio for a long time. 
[02:38:30]  Welcome to Ted's radio show.  How come nobody's listening?  W-T-E-D, New York, Light FM.  I say we continue what's the haps after the break.  The listeners hate this, to be fair.  They hate this more than anything.  They can't even hear it.  What the fuck?  They hate this more than anything.  Yeah.  I have a very soft sandwich.  It doesn't crunch or anything.  I know.  Look at this.  These chips feel great.  These pretzels feel wonderful in my hand, though. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  I'm eating a premature baby on potatoes.  Oh, God damn.  Wow.  Potatoes.  No bones in it.  Nice and quiet.  Nice and quiet.  How the fuck did you get a fluffy, big, egg white almond?  Mine looks like it has AIDS.  Well, it just has AIDS.  Maybe they sell your act.  I don't know.  Easy there, fucking genius.  Yours?  Bobby, yours costs $2.69.  His costs about $20.  That's the difference.  Does it really?  Oh, yeah.  And trust me, Kenny will be giving you the bill.  This is my welcome back to the show meal.  Yeah.  Nothing. 
[02:39:30]  All right.  That subject.  Why did Bobby...  I want to know why Bobby got a cheaper omelet.  Bob, go.  All right.  And he spit food back into his mood.  That's fucking gross.  It's like the top of your head.  Fucking all red.  Do you know what I do with my tuna sometimes?  Huh?  God, Jimmy.  I chew up tuna, and then I put it on my tuna, so I have a lot of tuna.  Jimmy chewed up his tuna sandwich, spit it on top of his sandwich, and then just ate 
[02:40:00]  it.  I was showing my cud.  That explains his fucking insect's body.  It was almost acceptable, but there was chunks of pretzel in it.  Chunks of...  To make it plural, it would have been funny.  Insects.  Insects.  Like, I'm possessing the body of an insect, and I have it at home.  We're going to take a short break.  When we get back, the food will be done, and we're going to do What's the Haps?  What's the Haps?  With Sam and the Google phone.  All right.  Let's do that.  All right.  I like that.  Oh, Google Bob.  I Hate Your Guts, Jim Norton. 
[02:40:30]  Keep doing that for Jimmy today.  There was some kind of an I missed mention, too.  I'm hoping we can get a hold of it.  Another one?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, good.  I Hate Your Guts, Jim Norton.  Keep Googling that today.  Opie and Anthony.  We're in the middle of What's the Haps.  We got more Foundry songs today?  Maybe we'll rest at it.  Maybe do some more tomorrow.  We got some big hitters in here today. 
[02:41:00]  Nick DiPaolo and Robert Kelly.  Nickdip.com.  RobertKellyLive.com.  Yes.  All right.  Sam, what's the Haps?  So where were we?  The Google phone?  You went to Times Square?  Yeah, because the Google phone came out today, and the big celebration, I guess, was at the  T-Mobile store in Times Square.  Much like the Apple store was the location of the big celebration for the introduction of  the iPhone.  Lines, two blocks long, city blocks.  And you said something a couple days ago about the economy, and I went to the Apple store 
[02:41:30]  just like you did.  And you go in there, and you realize, ah, the economy's just fine.  People are buying, buying, buying, buying.  Yeah.  That store is constantly full.  Why is that?  My iPod doesn't hold a fucking charge.  That was three fucking years ago.  Cock-sick.  They should just get into other businesses to save the economy, because they know how to  sell the tech stuff.  You go down there, and they just got that cattle line of people waiting to ring out.  Yeah.  And then other people, just like Japanese tourists, seem to want to go down there just 
[02:42:00]  to take pictures.  Yeah, but they have a great thing.  They scan you.  They have computers, handhelds.  Yeah, they take you right off the line.  It's like a tricorder.  Can't get the money fast enough.  Well, why wasn't I chosen to be taken off the line?  Can you buy a computer?  No, they look at you and then decide if they should take you off the line or not.  What, am I trying to get you into a nightclub in L.A.?  Yeah.  No, they ask you what you get.  They didn't ask me.  That's what I'm getting at.  They ask, like, every other person or something.  Did you have anything in your hands?  I had a few things, yeah.  Maybe I wasn't buying enough or something. 
[02:42:30]  I ain't for a phone.  All right, so the Google phone.  Well, Sam, what can you tell us?  Because I covered...  I'm a reporter.  With something called journalistic integrity.  Did you say a reporter?  Yeah, a reporter.  A reporter.  Yeah.  That's what I thought you said.  Yeah.  Yeah, he is.  Nick, he is.  I covered the iPhone release, went down and talked to some of the people online.  I recall that.  It would not have been fair.  You won the Pulitzer Prize for that, didn't you?  No, but I was nominated.  Oh, Cleo. 
[02:43:00]  Cleo.  Do you know Uma Pujiragio?  Wow, you know all their names.  Yeah.  Very good.  That's a tough one to pronounce.  I can't pronounce that one yet.  She's a nice lady.  I'll get it to say.  But yeah, but...  Back to Brian Williams.  Go ahead.  It would not have been fair to not also cover the release and the, you know, celebration of  the Google phone.  No, the iPhone killer, my friend.  We're celebrating phones.  What the fuck?  The iPhone killer.  What kind of phone you got, Nick?  I got a nice black rotary phone.  Works terrific.  12-foot extension cord.  My career's hopping. 
[02:43:30]  This is me calling my agent.  He does the sound of that.  That's like...  I just did.  Damn, that's brilliant.  I'm multi-talented.  That brought me right back.  Sure did.  To dad ripping it off the wall and throwing it.  Oh.  Have you got hit with one of those?  Oh, Christ.  Dad loved throwing things.  Holy shit.  The phone.  The spaghetti.  Nick's now throwing stuff.  He like...  He put the spaghetti on the wall and then took the phone off the wall. 
[02:44:00]  What?  He just didn't know what he was doing.  Oh, the spaghetti was constantly...  Wait, your dad used to yank phones out of the wall?  Oh, hell yeah.  Wow.  Nice.  Oh, fuck.  Is there anything that was sticking out or would be punched or thrown on the floor or  broken?  Like waking up and just going, okay, let's survey the damage today from last night's argument  that I sat there in bed crying over and didn't get to sleep.  I woke up for school like I wake up for this show. 
[02:44:30]  I felt like I was like eight years old, but I felt hungover and tired.  Just like I do when I come here.  I got a good joke.  Well, your dad sounds like a real bull in a china shop.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's not funny, Jim.  New character.  Yeah, so it was always just some kind of...  You know, you wake up and go, okay, there's some broken glass.  Watch out for that.  Here's this.  Is Smokey still alive? 
[02:45:00]  Or did dad like, you know, kick the cat?  There's a handful of mummy's hair on the kitchen floor.  Yeah, mummy's hair is on the floor.  One day, I just remember her like in the walk-in closet.  She was like, like, because she used like the tactics of the 300.  She was thinking, if I go in a place that's a narrow pass, I could defend myself no matter  what he lobs at me.  So she's in there.  And I just remember hearing, get out of here, fuck face. 
[02:45:30]  Get out of here, you fuck face.  And she called him fuck face so many times that it was just like, it was too...  As a kid, I'm just going, she's using that way too much.  She's a cursing hack.  Fuck face.  And then fuck face like left.  God forbid, you know, she doesn't have improv skills as things are being whipped at her head.  Yeah.  You can bob and weave, I'll tell you that.  Get her into Second City, whatever.  I was just always some... 
[02:46:00]  And it would start out, like, we'd get sent to bed.  It was in some shithole apartment in Central Islip.  And we'd get sent to bed, so I'd be laying in bed, and you'd hear outside just kind of  this low...  I don't know what I'm talking about.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Well, I don't know what I'm talking about.  But there's a song about the song.  And it's, like, through the walls. 
[02:46:30]  And then I'm...  And then I try, I got his stomach ache, to try to make him stop.  Oh, my God.  He's breaking my heart.  Oh, dude, I was the biggest little pussy fucking just crybaby.  Oh.  What was the initial...  My brother would take it differently.  He'd wait until they were in another room fighting.  Open up the liquor cabinet and take a swig of Jack at, like, nine. 
[02:47:00]  Nice.  You know, it's a good opportunity to get a buzz on.  Now, there was a time they were in love, so where did this all begin?  I wouldn't remember it.  You don't remember them ever being nice to each other and in love?  Nope.  Not a second do I remember.  They're still together, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's a marriage that lasted 50 years.  Sure.  Oh, God.  So far.  First of all, the second my father did leave...  Yes.  He went to the furthest point without falling into the opposite ocean on... 
[02:47:30]  He went all the way to Dana Point, California.  California, yeah.  It was like as far as you can go and stay dry and not have to, like, take a ship.  They're both living in lighthouses on different coasts.  Yeah, mom moved into, you know, the Montauk lighthouse.  It was just...  There was just a...  You can't even say a dislike, a this, a that.  It was a hatred.  Did he ever hit you?  Isn't it funny that you liked each other?  My dad smacked me once, but that was when I was in California.  I was, like, 14 or so, 13, and I had taken a bunch of quarters, and I think they were 
[02:48:00]  silver quarters, like these old-time quarters that, who knows, now they'd be worth, like,  fucking 28 cents, who cares?  But I was fucking starving constantly.  Dad wasn't too responsible with feeding the kids, so I was just starving constantly.  Jesus Christ, who's your old man, Tyson?  Oh, he was just like...  He just wanted to go out to California and be a cowboy, so he went out, he bought horses,  figured out ways to board them for free from talking to people. 
[02:48:30]  He was a great...  My father could fucking swindle people really good at it.  So he bought a horse, got people to board it for nothing.  He was like the caretaker of this property.  He never took care of.  He just put free shit on there.  All the time, horses, they were grazing on other people's fucking grass and shit.  He didn't care.  So, you know, as far as jobs went, he was constantly unemployed and bitching about the economy, but 
[02:49:00]  everyone else was working.  And him and his buddy, Chato, would sit there drinking Tall Boys when I came home from school.  I'd walk to the stables, and there he is drinking a Tall Boy, and he's like, oh, no job hunting  today, I guess.  Oh, well, right.  So I'm like fucking starving.  His wife, it wasn't his wife at the time, his girlfriend, Corey, she was, you know, just  the same, but she's working at some five and dime, barely making any money.  I lost her, though.  But you guys lived on a ranch? 
[02:49:30]  It was like, yeah, yeah, it was...  But you had no money.  No, we lived in a condo complex that was close to the ranch.  The ranch wasn't like a ranch like the fucking Ponderosa.  It was, you know, it was a hillside with some horses and a trailer on it.  But who owned that?  Will Rogers.  Because you guys were there all the time.  Who owned the property?  Yeah.  San Juan Capistrano.  Also, anyone could go there.  The town.  And my father talked to the town and said, you need a caretaker here because motorcyclists  are coming and cutting fences and stuff.  And they said, all right, you want to do it? 
[02:50:00]  He's like, yeah, I'll do it for free if you'll let me board my horses.  Oh, so it was a care...  Oh, wow, okay.  But he didn't take care of anything.  Right, right.  He just, you know, kind of hung out.  So I stole these quarters because I was starving and went to...  I remember I went to Thrifty Drug and Discount Store.  Which they have out there.  And bought a nutritious box of ice cream sandwiches.  And I ate every single one of them.  And I did have a job earlier.  And that's the money I used to buy, like, my model rockets and things like that. 
[02:50:30]  But my father was like, you took the quarters, didn't you?  And I was like, yeah.  And he goes, why?  And I told him, I said, I was starving.  I bought something to eat.  And he smacks me in the face and goes, no, you bought your goddamn fucking rockets with it, didn't you?  And I'm like, I'm sitting there going, I'm being smacked because I was starving.  Because you're drinking a tall boy instead of fucking buying some food.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it was horrid.  You ought to make a movie.  And then I would take the bottles at the Vons that was there. 
[02:51:00]  They had a big cage, a chain-link fence cage, where they would take the depositable bottles back.  And then they'd put them in this big chain-link cage behind the store until whoever came to take them away took them away.  I would climb the fence, grab the bottles, bring them right back around front, and give them the depositable bottles that were in the cage.  Nice scam.  So I could then, you know, buy more ice cream sandwiches.  And a triple scoop ice cream from thrifty drug and discount store.  By the way, people say...  Five cents a scoop.  It's like the modern day Oliver. 
[02:51:30]  I was horrid, I was.  People are saying this isn't a bit anymore, it's a nightmare, because we've heard the spaghetti hitting the wall too many times at this point, but you always give more info.  Oh, there's a little more info every time when I remember.  Some fucking synapse connects in my head, and I go, oh, I remember that fucking piece of shit from my youth.  Now, your dad was scared shitless that you would turn out gay.  But how did he associate some of these things you were doing as maybe becoming gay?  Because I would cry at everything. 
[02:52:00]  I was like, eh.  But like, building like little model rockets and stuff, and...  Because I wasn't fucking girls.  No, but then he was building the model...  But you were 11 or 12.  I hope he's building the model rockets, and he was sitting on them.  And I would shoot them up in my ass.  I'd set it up horizontally and get on all fours.  Yeah, he left that part out of the story.  And he'd put two eggs on each side and then shoot it into his own face.  And go, oh, daddy, you'll come.  He used to say, I was in man training, he called it. 
[02:52:30]  He goes, that's part of man training.  All right, here's a rifle and one bullet.  Go out and hunt.  But you...  And if you don't get something, you just don't eat for the night.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  But it's a shame.  Like fucking pawingles.  It's a shame, because you could have been like a rocket scientist or something.  You had like major skills as a little kid, and he didn't see it that way.  He said, fuck that.  I need my son fucking and drinking.  What was his skill?  He was just putting rockets together.  You weren't fucking building real rockets.  No, but he was...  Real rockets.  Retards do that.  It's glue.  Thank you, Bobby. 
[02:53:00]  SD rockets?  Bobby, you got to know the whole catalog of stories he's told over the years.  The kid was ahead of everybody else in his age group.  He was a very smart kid.  I was at all...  But the dad didn't want anything to do with that crap.  He didn't like, like, faggy stuff.  Like, guys crying...  For me to cry was, like, ridiculous.  And I was a big crybaby.  I went into a horse show once.  Took my horse, Nightmare.  And the horse's name was called Nightmare.  Fucking big arch in its back.  And I was doing a cloverleaf barrel racing thing at a horse show. 
[02:53:30]  Is that kind of faggy?  No, no, that's like...  I don't know.  It's Gymkhana.  It's like fucking...  It's pretty good shit.  Were you riding side saddle?  Side saddle with a dress.  Did you have a cape?  Seeking sports coat.  You have to, you know, really tightly go around the barrels, these three barrels in a cloverleaf pattern,  and then shoot through the timing holes.  You could do that shit?  Oh, yeah.  Right now you think you could?  Fuck yeah.  Holy shit.  That's like riding a bike.  What the fuck, dude?  The guy's got a house full of guns.  He used to ride horses.  What the fuck's going on? 
[02:54:00]  And when I lost by, like, a couple of tenths of a second, and what did I do?  It's going to take a while.  You cried.  You cried.  Knock it off.  And then I got a cramp in my leg once, and started, like, um...  I grabbed my leg and just screamed bloody murder, and my father's like...  He goes, next time you scream like that, you better have a fucking arrow in your chest.  Oh, God.  And by the way...  What the fuck?  Oh, yeah, he didn't...  What's your mother's name?  Libya?  Holy shit.  It's not like riding a bike, by the way.  No?  No, because when the bike comes in first, you don't suck the kickstand. 
[02:54:30]  Get it?  Of course I do.  Of course, Dick.  What the fuck, man?  Oh, it's just one of those things.  I don't...  That explains a lot.  And then driving with him.  I've told that story where it was like...  There was a thing called the Ortega Highway.  It was...  It should...  This should be in any fucking movie where something plunges off a cliff and explodes  after falling thousands of feet.  Oh, Jesus.  It was the road from Capistrano to Lake Elsinore, and he used to drive it every so often, and 
[02:55:00]  when I drove with him, I was the most nervous wreck.  He'd drive with cores, just a can of cores between his legs, and a six-pack or two six-packs  in a bag on the seat, and just constantly be drinking.  When we got to Lake Elsinore, he's drinking, and then the ride back, all I'd remember is  on a curvy road.  A curvy cliff road that you'd always hear about people dying on.  And we'd be there just like nailing the edge as these giant Conrock cement trucks are coming 
[02:55:30]  down the other way, and I was just...  I was scared shitless that every time we hit a light and had a stop, it was one moment  where I could go and just breathe, and then the second the light turned green, I was like  all tense again, and nervous for two hours straight of just nerves like a chihuahua.  You were like Woody Allen and Annie Hall with Christopher Walken driving the car.  You gotta know the money. 
[02:56:00]  It was horrific, that drive.  In an old Ford pickup truck.  Like, everyone else had like a pickup that was at least like 1970, something like that.  Power steering.  And yeah, he had like a 66 Ford pickup truck where like the, it had the fender wells on  the outside of the bed, and it was all rounded and curved, and he was constantly drilling  holes in the engines and running tubes because the oil wasn't getting to a cylinder or something.  And one time they shut the electricity off.  Of course, he didn't pay the bill. 
[02:56:30]  He pulled the meter off and jumped the insulators that the electric company put on to cut your  electricity off, and just stuck two wires in there, jumped the meter, put the meter back  on, and we were getting power without the meter spinning.  So he had some positives.  He had some skills as far as getting shit paid, like not paying for shit.  Pat from Monocularize, too bad good old dad didn't live long enough to see Ed become a  LARPer.  Ah.  Yes.  Wow.  What he would say about that.  I knew I was playing EverQuest. 
[02:57:00]  What are you doing with that?  Fuck men, computer people things?  Yes, dad, that's what I'm doing.  If he was alive, I might have just gone gay to fucking give him a little twist, a little  screw.  I might have had to get my dick sucked by that Richard kid in the tree forge.  How did you not kiss that fucking kid?  He was gorgeous.  He was gorgeous.  Oh, beautiful.  Beautiful boy.  Do you have a picture, Richard, to show Bobby?  Do you have a picture of a kid that you could have blown?  Well, my sister said, no, I wasn't going to blow him.  He wanted to blow me in the tree forge.  We were sleeping out at the ranch one night, and me and my brother and stuff, 
[02:57:30]  had built this tree fort, so we were sleeping out, me and Richard.  I had known Richard for years.  We'd go fishing together and riding horses and shit.  He was my best friend.  Right.  He wanted to catch a mouthful of tadpoles.  Tommy gills.  Yeah.  Tommy gills.  I'm not talking about hooking any Tommy gills.  I'm talking about sharking.  I'm talking about working for a living.  You're talking about felching for a living.  Felching. 
[02:58:00]  Squeeze my balls.  Tie my dick into a sheep shank.  Chief, men, ladies and gentlemen.  Tell me how short you wanted it.  So you're in a cheat for with him?  Shot glass full of cum.  Don't drink that.  Here's the swimming with bow-legged men.  Show me the way to go, homo.  I'm tired and I want to give a guy head.  I'll drink to your penis.  You drink to mine.  Going to need a bigger cup.  That was the USS Google.  12 fags in the water. 
[02:58:30]  12 fags.  This Mr. Hooper was one of Rosie O'Donnell's fag cruises.  Hear that terrible high-pitched screaming and hollering.  Someone's getting fucked in the ass.  Sheets filled with blood.  You go in the water.  Dick's in the water.  Our dick.  Well, three days in.  I don't want to open that shark.  My body pops up.  A friend of mine from a gay body.  Popped up ass first. 
[02:59:00]  Herbie Hand likes to suck cocky.  He'd been fucked in the mouth and the ass.  I don't want to open up that shark  and have a whole bunch of semen spill out all over the dick.  Hey, we took that one and ran it.  Yeah, we certainly did.  Nice.  Look, fellas, let's be reasonable.  Let's not suck each other's dicks right here on the dock.  That was great, wasn't it?  Those bathhouses will stay open for the 4th of July.  Martin, my boyfriend was on that beach too yesterday. 
[02:59:30]  Sign the marriage certificate.  Sign it, Mayor.  You know what's the thing to do.  Uh-oh, we're losing Angel.  She doesn't know Jaws.  Oh, Angel.  She's putting on a little lip stuff.  You look like Chrissy that gets eaten at the beginning.  Lucky shark.  Really?  Hairy Chrissy Bush.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Shark was picking hairs out of his teeth.  I know.  He was just coughing.  That's what fucking Quint was holding on to 
[03:00:00]  to try not to get into the mouth.  Chrissy's pubic hairs.  Fish is like, this tastes like myself.  I'm never going to get the smell out of me.  That old gag.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, no, Richard was, you know.  Hot.  Wow.  Yeah, well, we had the, well, that's how it started,  the tree fort thing, and the thing he wanted to, you know,  we were friends, we used to do a lot, you know, hang out,  and then we decided, oh, yeah, well, let's just hang out. 
[03:00:30]  We'll spend the night.  We'll have a sleep out at the tree fort at the ranch.  And I was sleeping there.  We're hanging out, drinking a few beers and stuff,  which I guess loosened him up.  31.  31?  No, 14.  14.  14.  Maybe bordering on 15.  Very close to 15.  I think you were a little younger.  Yeah, maybe eight.  And so we're hanging out, and I'm kind of just sleeping at this point,  or trying to go to sleep, and Richard leans over at this point.  What did you have on?  I had everything on.  My jeans, my everything. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  I'm sleeping in my clothes.  So Richard leans over to my ear and goes, can I suck your cock?  Nice.  Out of nowhere.  How close to your ear was he?  Enough where I felt his warm, could have had chlorine breath.  Nice.  Yeah, and he asked me that.  So I, like, I was turned around.  I had jeans on, thank God, because I was turned around with my ass facing him.  My face was facing. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, like fucking broke back mountain.  Broke back tree fort.  I've been waiting for years.  Fuck that ass.  So I'm looking at the wall of the tree fort, and my eyes are, like, fucking open,  and I'm like, did I just fucking hear that?  And just in case I didn't, he repeated it.  How do we?  I want to suck your cock.  Oh, he didn't ask?  He said he wants to.  No, no, he said he wants to.  So I then.  Sucked his cock.  Yeah.  I let him suck my dick.  Fat, huge snake.  And then, no, no. 
[03:02:00]  I lay there and just kind of went like.  Your dick got hurt?  You pretended you were asleep?  Make-believe sleepy snort.  He's not a bear.  Shemp.  He's not a bear.  You pulled the shemp?  Oh, yeah.  I fear that was my only defense against the male homo.  Against the gay.  Yeah.  Play dead and he won't blow you.  Pretty much what it was.  And the next morning was a little awkward. 
[03:02:30]  I would say so.  I was like, oh, rise and shine.  It's 4.30 in the morning.  I think I've got to go home.  Yeah.  I may believe I was asleep the whole time.  So did he know you heard him?  How was he the next morning?  I think he was a little awkward about the whole thing.  But I think he turned over and I think he jerked off out the fucking door of the tree fort.  What, did he do it in your name?  Yeah.  What, did you see his?  He wrote Anthony's name in his cum.  That's what I just said.  Why do you think that?  Because I could hear it. 
[03:03:00]  You see a squirrel with cum all over.  I could hear it.  And, you know, kind of the tree was swaying a little bit.  Was your underwear sticking to your ass?  I was wearing clothing, Bobby Kelly.  Wildlife was losing weight rapidly.  Holy fucking...  It was one of those situations where, yeah, the next morning was a little awkward.  Why didn't you cry?  You cried at everything else.  That's where you should have been crying.  At that point, I had gotten over my crying face.  He needed to love.  I mean, somebody loved him as much.  You didn't even think about it? 
[03:03:30]  No.  I was already getting laid from the time I was, like, 13.  Yes, by this other gentleman.  What was...  By Buzz.  You don't want to cheat on him?  By Buzz.  Christine, her name was.  Chris.  What was your relationship with your dad at the end of his life?  Pretty good.  We've heard a lot of these stories, but...  No, pretty good.  He totally mellowed with age.  He wound up getting a pretty successful welding business that he had, so he was able to take  trips, went to Hawaii and stuff like that, and buy new trucks.  Welding rigs.  He got a lot of contracts in Capistrano. 
[03:04:00]  He's a survivor.  The guy's a survivor.  And stuff.  So, yeah.  He was.  Until his ticker stopped.  Oh, when was that?  And survived that one.  That didn't matter.  Back in, like, 94, something like that.  So, he was a quitter.  I had the repeat.  Yeah, he gave up.  He finally just gave up.  But it was just one of those situations where it was just always this turmoil going on.  I want to see this kid that wanted to suck your car.  Where's Richard?  Why do you want to see this kid so bad, Bobby?  You can't not want to talk to him.  Where's the gorgeous Richard?  You pull your dick out. 
[03:04:30]  Look at the picture.  Is he as cute as Sam?  He makes Sam look like a fat chick.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  And it was awful going out, like, hanging out with him.  Going out to the mall or something.  Because every girl was all over this fucking kid.  And I was sitting there with, like, fucking cystic acne all over my face.  And fucking, you know, just smelling like horse shit.  Because I had just cleaned the stables.  And, like, I was just a wreck.  Like, write a book.  I had to fucking, I had to get a sense of humor. 
[03:05:00]  I had to.  Or my dick would fucking never have gone into a girl.  Ever.  Oh my God.  I would have fucking, if I had no sense of humor, I'd have taken that blowjob in a second.  Would you suck?  Yeah, suck my cock, please.  Somebody.  I didn't know what he was going to say.  He was going to say, you know, could I suck on a fucking Jolly Rancher you have?  And I'm going to be like, what about my cock?  That's not good fun.  A cock.  Yeah, I know.  Believe me.  I have a fucking ten books. 
[03:05:30]  What is this?  In just my childhood.  Funny shit.  It's insanity what went on.  It's time to start writing.  My mother finally, when I decided to come back out to New York, my mother sent my father money for plane fare.  My father cashed in the tickets and puts his kid, who is fucking, like, 14 years old.  Not on a bus.  And his other kid, 15, on a Greyhound fucking bus.  We spent two weeks going cross-country with male hookers, fucking degenerates, all kinds of shit.  And gave us $100 for a two-week trip to go cross-country, which we promptly tried to double in Vegas. 
[03:06:00]  Which you wasted on the male hookers an hour into the car.  Well, the male hooker, because then I was thinking, man, a blowjob.  Sounds a little pretty good about that.  Keep the camera in a treehouse.  And then Joe had tie stick that he was bringing back.  And then when we stopped at the Port Authority, a cop instantly took us, thinking we were runaways.  So we had some chick from, where the hell was she from?  I don't even remember, but she went and took the bag.  There he is.  No way.  That's young Richard.  That's when he was older.  That's after I left. 
[03:06:30]  He was like, I think, 18 there.  He was a model.  And a beard for Christy McNichol, by the way.  You could have had a blowjob for a model.  Yeah, they used to go out like that.  Why wouldn't you take head from him?  He probably gives great head.  He probably would.  Jesus Christ, what kind of show am I on here?  And then he went completely gay.  We're talking about...  And he's dead now from AIDS.  Well, you know, you can tell despite his hair.  He's dead?  He's dead.  Yeah.  You got no shot.  He had a bad before he had AIDS.  I know, right?  He had a nice fresh Richard.  I know, right?  Fresh meat. 
[03:07:00]  He probably got it like...  He was probably the first one.  Like someone fucked a monkey and then he fucked him.  Paul Lim.  Yeah.  Hi, Richard.  When they thought it was cancer.  When did he die?  Oh, my God.  How long ago did he die?  He died in like 2000.  I didn't even know until like fucking two years ago.  He died.  I said, so how's Richard?  And oh, well, let me tell you about that.  If you want a blowjob now, it's going to be a little bony.  It's going to be a toothy one.  It's not even gay.  Oh, my God.  It's like fucking the shit that falls on you out of caves in every Spielberg movie. 
[03:07:30]  I hope his parents aren't listening.  No.  I think they're probably not too proud anyway.  They're walking around with the same glasses Woody Allen's parents wore and take the money  and run the fake nose.  So, with that set up, what's the haps with Sam?  I don't even know how we got there again.  Sam.  It always goes to my almost blowjob in a fucking tree fort.  I know.  The regrets.  Sam?  You go to the tree fort?  But every time Anthony tells a story, he gets closer to telling the real truth.  And that's what I like about the retelling of the story. 
[03:08:00]  Perhaps if he wasn't such a good friend at the time, you know, if it was just some anonymous  cute kid, he's a good friend.  I have a similar story from college.  You just didn't want to.  From college?  The guy pretended he was sleeping?  God damn, Norton.  I'm too tired.  You can't even defend yourself.  You just didn't want to take head off him because you didn't want to fall in love with 
[03:08:30]  the guy.  My roommate used to do acid, and he climbed in my bed one night and was kissing my back.  Oh.  Yeah.  And I pushed him on the floor.  Almost got in a fist fight with him.  And we were like great friends and stuff.  He got, I mean, and he wasn't.  This guy banged every broad on the campus.  He was like a real good looking guy.  He must have been hallucinating.  Yeah.  I mean, he loved his acid and shit.  But I didn't talk to him for a couple months.  I was so furious.  You have to.  And we'll live it in the same dorm room.  That's not too fucking awkward, is it?  But it's all smooth overnight now. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, good.  Glad to hear it.  That's all, you know, forgotten about supposedly.  Better forget about it.  Yeah, if you want to see him, I got pictures of him on MySpace in his bathing suit.  All right, Sam, what's the app?  So the Google phone, you went there?  You went down there and you talked to people online.  Before we start, did we all hear Ari Gold send a shout out my way on Entourage this week?  Yeah, everyone's talking about that.  He said, what's the app on Entourage?  I don't watch that shitty show.  They think that you're being ripped off.  Take it easy, turtle. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  So what's the setup here, Sam?  Well, I went down to give the Google phone equal coverage that I gave the iPhone.  And because I am the reporter that I am, I talked to every single person on that line just for the Opie and Anthony show.  All Japanese teenagers.  How many people, Sam?  Three.  Three people.  Three people.  This is the iPhone killer, by the way.  Yeah, this is the one that's got three people to wait online. 
[03:10:00]  Me and Tamsin Fidel, we're interviewing three people.  All right.  We start with Anna.  Anna.  She's number one.  All right, we're here at the Google phone line with Anna.  Anna, what's the haps?  Well, basically, the phone.  The point that it's touchscreen and it has the keyboard.  So you're first online.  How long have you been here?  I've been here since like an hour and a half ago.  So it's at about 4.30 or so?  Yeah.  What are some of the features of this phone that you're looking forward to? 
[03:10:30]  Want to help give me a personality?  That's it.  The touchscreen.  I think they got touchscreen on iPhones too, don't they?  Yeah.  Yeah, and you can, like, it's more, I don't know.  I just heard a lot of reviews on it.  Did you?  And it's more, like, open to more apps.  Oh, really?  It's open to more apps.  Wow, this phone's going to be hot.  Maybe she just pronounced apps wrong.  It's open. 
[03:11:00]  It's being sold in another part of New York.  You know what?  Here's the problem with it.  Here's the problem.  It is T-Mobile.  Nobody wants fucking T-Mobile.  Hook it up with Verizon.  Like, BlackBerry has the touch coming out in December.  And why all the people online, Jimmy?  Yeah.  All right.  And the media attention.  A lot of people love... 
[03:11:30]  Times Square was a buzz this morning.  Times Square was a buzz.  You can't even say tens of people.  No.  People buy them because they're afraid they're not going to have something that everybody else has.  Yes.  That's the fucking bottom line.  That's what drives this whole fucking insanity.  I call it, keep it up with the Joneses.  Exactly.  The Jim Joneses.  Exactly.  I have one senator to shoot coming up.  Have some Kool-Aid.  That's all that is about.  That's all it's the fucking about.  I got a regular shitty cell phone.  It works just fine.  That's all you need.  Plus, this chick showed up at four.  The guys that flew over Jonestown and thought they were having a picnic. 
[03:12:00]  Yo, look, they're all lying down hugging each other for three straight days without moving.  Oh, there's flies relaxing on them.  A lot of flies at this picnic.  Yeah, doesn't anybody have any off down there?  They're all hugging each other.  Wait for the big Kool-Aid guy to run through.  Yeah.  Hey, Kool-Aid.  One story, stepping in fucking rotting bodies.  Big fat and jolly Kool-Aid.  That would be a funny visual, wouldn't it?  The Kool-Aid smile running through dead bodies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have more from Anna.  Ah, Anna.  She's happy that she's, what, waiting on the party line?  It's got buttons on it. 
[03:12:30]  Well, yeah, Anna showed up at 4.30 to get this phone that obviously she has no idea anything about it.  Yeah.  Proving my point.  What time is the store opening?  At 8.  Do you think you probably would have been better served just coming at 8 and just buying it?  No.  Why not?  How come?  I don't know.  I like the excitement.  I like waiting here, being cold.  It's fun.  See?  It does kind of seem like a party here.  How long did it take for the second person?  Hold on.  Listen to this cocksucker, Sam. 
[03:13:00]  It's like, yeah, it really is like a party here.  It gets hard to look at people like six inches away from them.  It's not a long...  You are so sarcastic.  It does kind of seem like a party here.  How long did it take for the second person to get here?  The second person?  They just got here, actually.  So it's just kind of been you standing outside in the cold for about two hours?  Yeah.  Two hours.  Cold.  Why would you...  After 15 minutes, you would try to go, you know what?  This is a bust.  I'll just come back and eat.  I could come back when the store opens.  I'll go to a Starbucks for a few hours. 
[03:13:30]  Somewhere warm.  People are stupid.  She's never been the first.  It just does.  She's never been the first for anything.  Nope.  Oh, okay.  That's what this is about.  I was the first one to buy that Google phone in New York.  She'll tell everyone that.  And no one will care.  No one will care.  Except for the guy who drills his fist in her gold teeth and takes it.  One guy will fucking knock out her tooth with a fucking diamond in it and fucking take  her Google phone.  Remove her hat and her phone. 
[03:14:00]  Yes.  Because he'll think it's a goggle phone and try to wear it in the pool.  It'll be her boyfriend.  The T-Mobile store was also bringing out like massive plates of pastries and muffins  and like big coffee machines for the crowd.  Jesus fucking Christ.  For the crowd of three?  They fucking thought this was going to be like the iPhone around the block.  Please tell me they hired security.  Of course they had all the staff was there.  It was 5.30 in the morning and all the T-Mobile shirts were on. 
[03:14:30]  Everybody setting up the store, blowing up balloons.  Do they have little banners, those lame banners that were blown in the wind and no one's  there to appreciate it?  Dude, that is fantastic.  They go, can we cancel those 100 peaches and just get a 6-inch tuna pickles?  1-6-inch tuna.  They had to 3.  Call it a morning.  A red rope.  No one can afford a new phone.  The economy stinks.  What a bad time for the Google phone.  They should have delayed it.  But it was not, it didn't care about excitement. 
[03:15:00]  What do you mean?  They could have worked it into the marketing.  Now you can put your fucking stockbroker on.  It's the iPhone killer.  The thing Apple and Steve Jobs knows how to do, it's like build excitement before the  product comes out.  He goes up, he gets on stage, he's in front of that giant screen that's irradiating him  to death and he could point shit out and just show like these features and everyone  gets so fucking hyped and excited that they, yeah, when he goes, oh, what is it, Jimmy? 
[03:15:30]  Right.  When you're scrolling.  And he builds excitement that way that people go, I want this, I want this, I got to have  it.  They didn't do shit with the Google phone.  It was like on fucking, it was on MSNBC's like the financial report, they'd show it.  No, no excitement.  And it was all about it though.  Oh, okay.  What about George?  George was, George was about it too.  I would like to buy this phone.  Stories.  It's a future. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, we know.  You know what would have been a great fucking way to do it, man?  You fucking show a commercial where the guy walks in with the Google phone and there's  confetti all over.  That would be, that's exciting.  Sure is.  What happened?  I hate your guts, Jim Norton.  Oh.  Sounds like a name for a book.  And he's not promoting his book.  Right.  It's a, I hate you or something.  Oh, I hate everybody.  I hate, um.  There is a time constraint, gentlemen.  We've all agreed already. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, shut up, McGurk.  You jerk.  I already mentioned earlier that somebody said that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's that, uh, Jimmy, uh, Jimmy Norton's book is a, yeah, yeah, yeah, jackass.  What's the title?  Something stupid?  Uh, five after the hour.  I missed it in the morning.  It's like, what the fuck did you just say?  Nothing done.  Oh, they cut him off so quick.  Let's, uh, let's meet George.  Yeah, George is here.  All right, we're on the, uh, Google phone line with George. 
[03:17:00]  George, what's the haps?  The second of three people.  Just waiting for the phone to see if it's good as they say it is.  The good thing about it is that it has a keyboard to go with the touchscreen, a thing that, uh, the iPhone doesn't have.  No.  My iPhone.  Boy, am I not in touch.  Wow.  Here I go.  Here I go.  I go like this.  Wow.  And, hey, there's my touchscreen fucking, uh, keyboard.  There we go.  Thank you.  How about a Blackberry, Jim?  Oh, fuck.  And I could text like a motherfucker on this.  A virtual keyboard is still a keyboard.  It's a keyboard, uh. 
[03:17:30]  How come you think there aren't more than three people online for the keyboard?  Yeah, I'm pretty shocked about that because I heard in California some girl waited seven hours to get her phone, so that's what we're saying.  No, that was to get her tits.  Yeah, I think it's all.  Seven hours.  Shut up.  When did you leave this morning, or when did you get up this morning?  I got up at three.  Ugh, I changed planes in Cleveland.  You think you probably, you kind of regret getting up at three, that maybe you probably could have come here at, like, noon and still gotten one. 
[03:18:00]  At noon.  I thought there was going to be a whole line here.  Did you?  Why is that?  How they said in California it was packed.  You fell for the hype, you ignorant fuck.  We'll see.  But, hey, you get to be the third person in New York to have the Google phone.  That's pretty cool.  Do you think this one's going to be the iPhone killer?  In some ways it is, like the keyboard, for example.  All right, with your keyboard.  Jesus Christ, with your keyboard.  Why no three people who won't be getting an iPhone?  What the fuck?  Buy a piano, you jerk.  Well, there's three people.  He goes, so there's three people that won't be getting an iPhone. 
[03:18:30]  They've sold their 10 millionth iPhone three months early ahead of schedule.  Oh, we're losing a share of the market.  Oh, fuck.  I've got to hear that again.  Well, I know three people who won't be getting an iPhone.  What a smart ass.  Did you look at the camera and say that?  You are a douche.  I love it.  Nice, subtle tone.  Oh, I know.  Oh, it's perfect.  He is fucking making morons of these people.  And they don't even know it.  And they love him.  They were all right next to each other, too. 
[03:19:00]  So the people could hear, like, the second person could hear the interview I did with  the first person, and they all still accepted to do interviews.  They still wanted to be interviewed.  Well, I was interviewed online.  Were you?  By who?  I don't know.  He has a question.  He has some fine hair, though.  You're going to get punched.  One day I will.  I know I will.  One good punch.  Rosy red nose to go with those cheeks.  The last person online, like Sam said, he talked to everybody online, is Josh. 
[03:19:30]  We've heard two-thirds.  Two-thirds of the line so far.  Of the Google line.  Okay.  And this is Josh, the last one.  All right, we're on the Google phone line with Josh.  Josh, what's the halves?  I'm online for a phone.  Did you wait online for the iPhone?  Yeah.  What are you going to do with a Google phone if you already have an iPhone?  I work for a technology company, and usually I get one of everything so the executives get  it after me, and I know how to answer their questions.  What possessed you to wait online for it instead of just coming when the store opened? 
[03:20:00]  Because every activation takes, like, maybe 15 minutes, so there's 10 people online.  I'm here until 9 or 10 in the morning.  But wouldn't it have been more pleasant to wait for an hour in the sunlight than wait  for an hour at 5 o'clock in the morning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Except if they run out of inventory, then I have to wait a few weeks.  What do they have, four on hand?  Yeah, but they've probably got more than three phones.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's how it worked out.  Wow, Josh is sharp as a tack.  Yeah.  Fucking sad, though. 
[03:20:30]  I think they have more than three phones, you asshole.  They're not even standing in line.  They're standing on triangle.  Again, just what they deserve.  There's three people.  It's not a line.  Yeah, so they can talk to each other.  The whole line's talking to each other.  Yeah.  Josh is trying to cut.  Yeah.  Cut, double cut.  I'm not going to wait 10 minutes.  Dink.  They were all behind a red rope that had plenty more rope behind it.  I mean, there's lots of space in it.  Did you get pictures of this?  That's perfect.  No, I should have.  Oh, that's hilarious.  And finally, Josh ends with this.  In California, I read there were several dozen people that went to get the phone, so I figured 
[03:21:00]  there'd be at least several dozen here.  You can get the West Coast people to buy basically anything.  That might be true.  But I guess you could find three people to buy pretty much anything here, too, right?  Yeah, probably.  All right, cool.  Thanks a lot, Josh.  They don't even know.  They don't know he's insulting them.  Because I look at them in the eye and smile.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's like we're friends.  Of course.  Oh, you a dick.  Josh, how does it feel?  I'll be the third of three assholes with his phone. 
[03:21:30]  Fucking jerk off.  Pretty good.  Google phone.  It's all right, I guess.  Yeah.  Good job, Sam.  Yeah.  In California, it took this woman seven hours.  Great.  She lived in fucking Barstow.  Yeah.  She lived in Fresno.  She fucking hitchhiked from Chico.  Chico.  Chico.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard you can play Solitaire on this one.  Yeah.  Fucking great.  It's great.  No, Pac-Man, right?  Yeah, this one has Pac-Man and Google Maps.  Oh, great.  I can go back to 1978.  Google Maps.  Oh.  You going to play Pong on this one, too? 
[03:22:00]  Bloop.  Bloop.  Bloop.  I think I could get Google Maps.  I think I'd get Pac-Man.  Yeah.  This one has Street View Google Maps.  Oh.  I can zoom on my ex-girlfriend's house.  All right, let's go around the horn.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Wilbur Theater Friday.  Friday, yes.  Friday night.  And Chick-A-P-Mass Saturday night.  But who gives a shit about that?  Oh, is that Chinese restaurant still there?  Ugh, have you done it?  Let's get that Wilbur Theater filled.  Yeah, Wilbur Theater.  Poe, I need the truck.  Poe, I need the truck.  Jimmy, pre-order I Hate Your Guts on Amazon. 
[03:22:30]  It's moving up the charts.  And keep Googling I Hate Your Guts Jim Norton today.  Don't add to today.  I Hate Your Guts Jim Norton.  Google that.  Okay.  And NickDip.com.  He's got a couple dates.  NickDip.com.  Yeah.  John, sign up on my forum, too, will you?  We can talk.  We should.  But, yeah, November 28th at Tarry Town Music Hall.  The night after Thanksgiving.
