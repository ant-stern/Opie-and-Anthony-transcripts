<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a game where listeners guessed Anthony's desired concert ticket.  Incorrect guesses, like Britney Spears and NSYNC, prompted humorous exchanges, before a caller correctly identified No Doubt, winning WWF tickets. This led to a discussion, fueled by listener calls, about Anthony's surprisingly extensive collection of pop music CDs, contradicting his public persona.

The show then transitioned into "Black Rock Coalition Radio" hosted by Earl Douglas. This segment was characterized by the use of explicit racial slurs, offensive jokes, and racist humor from both the hosts and callers, interspersed with music from rock artists of color.

Following this, the program featured Dr. Allison, an ex-Playboy model and family practice physician, who discussed her experience on *Temptation Island* and the awkward realities of medical examinations.  This segment also included a preview of the "What the Hell Is That?" segment, which immediately followed.

"What the Hell Is That?" involved callers presenting various unusual medical conditions for diagnosis by several doctors in the studio.  Danielle revealed a third nipple (supernumerary nipple), potentially capable of lactation.  Mike displayed a scrotal skin tag, leading to a humorous suggestion for a "Cannibal Day" segment.  Heath described sweating only on one side of his face post-motorcycle accident; John reported chest fluid leakage; and Mel presented a large inner thigh growth.  Each case prompted medical discussion, often graphic and humorous, alongside Jim Norton's reactions to medical textbooks and a running joke about a possibly diseased couch.  Finally, Anthony revealed rotting corneas, leading to discussion of causes and treatments.  The segment concluded with mentions of upcoming show events and the "Sandy Kane" segment.

The Pete segment involved a man with a concerning jaw lump examined by in-studio doctors, including David Wilk.  Concerns about cancer and the need for an ENT specialist were raised, fueled by Pete's smoking history.  Listener Lori and “Mel,” described as looking like "a potato" with a tongue lump, also contributed.

The Sandy Kane segment featured the former stripper and public access host.  The hosts and doctors examined large genital warts on her abdomen, emphasizing the need for medical attention despite Sandy’s skepticism.  She then performed a song, "My Boyfriend's Black," referencing controversial figures. Listener calls punctuated this segment.  The broadcast concluded with an OJ Simpson 911 prank call.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Come on, Ann, I gotta bring it up.  Gotta bring it up.  It's rare we ever get anything on Anthony.  What's the problem? Why?  Ann just asked Ben, who's our ticket broker.  Ben's our personal concert ticket broker for the O&A show.  That's a little helpful reminder. Why?  So, there's all these great concerts coming to town.  Now, let me just read down the concerts coming to town. 
[00:00:30]  Let's play a little game with the listeners to see what tickets Anthony needs, okay?  You are a...  Oh, man.  Let me see. I picked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 fans coming to town.  You guess which show Anthony wants to go see, okay?  Okay. Does Anthony want to go to see the Allman Brothers? 
[00:01:00]  13 nights in March at the Beacon Theater.  Right.  Does Anthony want to see Lit? March 4th at Irving Plaza.  Mm-hmm.  Does Anthony want to see 311 March 4th at Roseland?  Okay.  Or could it be Ant needs tickets to see Typho Negative and Coal Chamber?  Yeah.  Now, that's a show that rocks!  Yeah.  March 14th at Roseland.  Does Anthony need tickets for Cracker?  That's a cute little band, too. Cracker.  March 20th and 21st at the Bowery Ballroom. 
[00:01:30]  Or does he need tickets for John Paul Jones, March 28th at Irving Plaza?  Must be corn tickets, right, Ant?  I know you love corn.  April 1st at the Continental Arena and April 8th at the Nassau Coliseum.  Or does Anthony need tickets to see No Doubt at April 6th at Roseland?  Or could it possibly be tickets to see Bruce Springsteen?  Bruce coming to town for like 10 dates. 
[00:02:00]  Let's play What Does Anthony Need Tickets To?  Allman Brothers, Lit, 311, Typho Negative, Cracker, John Paul Jones, Corn, No Doubt, or Bruce Springsteen?  Now, if it was up to me, I'd have a tough choice there.  Do I go see corn, or do I see Typho Negative and Coal Chamber?  Of course.  Let's go to Roger. 
[00:02:30]  Roger?  Yeah.  You want to play?  Sure.  Okay.  What does Anthony need concert tickets to?  Britney Spears.  Shut up.  No, it's not Britney Spears, believe it or not.  Anthony does not want tickets for Britney Spears.  Okay, thanks.  All right, man.  Later.  Let's go to George.  George, what does Anthony need tickets to?  That Fag wants to see NSYNC.  Get out of here.  What do I win?  Let me go on the ski trip.  You'll get nothing. 
[00:03:00]  It's got to be one of the shows we named.  No doubt.  Is that your answer?  Yeah.  Is that your final answer?  That is my final answer.  That is my final answer.  What do I get?  Let me go on the ski trip.  Shut up.  Come on.  I'm just a girl. 
[00:03:30]  Nothing's sacred.  Come on, Anthony.  They have like two good songs.  Nothing's sacred.  Are you going to get in the pit and mosh to this song, Anthony?  Yes.  That part, you could have your lighter out. 
[00:04:00]  Very good.  Very funny.  Go ahead.  You really don't want tickets to see Korn, Ant?  Come on.  Go to Typo Negative and Cold Chamber and hang out with a bunch of 20-year-old guys.  I'll go to No Doubt and be surrounded by chicks.  Typo Negative.  Good choice.  I'm getting a pair of tickets, Opie.  Does that make sense to you now?  I understand why you're getting a loan.  All right, guys.  I'm out of here.  Ant, you really let me down.  All right.  Hold on.  We've got to give you a prize for playing. 
[00:04:30]  What concert tickets does Anthony need?  What do you want?  We have a ton of stuff to get ready.  I want to go on the ski trip, man.  All right.  Where's the ski trip folder?  Oh, we're done with that.  We gave away all those spots already.  You could have wrestling tickets or the new album from Smashing Pumpkins.  Wrestling tickets.  Wrestling tickets?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on the line, man.  Cool.  George, nothing sacred around here.  George wins a pair of tickets to the WWF Saturday, April 15th at Madison Square Garden before  you can buy them, plus the WWF t-shirt.  Tickets go on sale this Sunday at 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster. 
[00:05:00]  Yes, Ben?  I think he's an actual fan, because remember the night going to Rick's bachelor party that  no doubt CD was in his truck?  All right, Ben.  You're really funny.  You're all a bunch of doles.  I understand.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Wait.  Before you give your explanation, we also have to mention that we did find an NXS CD in  your car, and Alanis Morissette?  Alanis Morissette.  See, when I used to drive you to work with Ann, we were rocking to, like, Zombie. 
[00:05:30]  Rob Zombie.  Come on.  I'm still rocking.  I don't get to commute with him anymore.  He's rocking it, no doubt.  In the cars.  You are the worst, man.  No, no.  Come on.  It's been a while since we've gotten something on you, Anthony.  No, no.  You see, you don't seem to understand.  Mm.  That, that, uh, there's...  Look, look.  Let's not forget the time you called me to talk stocks, and I heard, I heard this song 
[00:06:00]  in the background.  No!  You will admit that that was playing in the background.  Look.  Look, I was, I had the goddamn radio, and I'm scanning around, and finally you picked  up the phone, and that's what, where the radio was stopped.  Yeah.  And I started talking to you.  It was.  Oh, man.  There's no explaining it.  I'm sunk.  I wasn't...  Shut up.  I wasn't listening to this. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, man.  I can understand if it was like, bye-bye love by the cars or something.  That almost rocks.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  No, I wasn't listening to it.  It just came on.  It just happened to come on the radio.  Yeah, it was on scan, and it stopped on cue, and you picked the phone up.  What am I going to do?  Hold on up.  I got to get a cool song on the radio so you don't think I'm a tool?  You know?  Well, if you knew the show, yes.  Yeah, I know.  In hindsight, I guess I should have. 
[00:07:00]  You see what I've been doing now, though, whenever I call from the road?  Also.  I try to find a fan of your song to put on the radio.  When I call you, I make sure I have my Anal C CD.  Anal C.  Can't say the real name of the band.  Hey, Ann, just hanging out with this hardcore band.  What's up?  Just wanted to check in with you to see what we're doing on the show today.  Look. 
[00:07:30]  You want to dig up crap like this.  What?  You want to dig it up.  Who had to get an autographed Ricky Martin CD?  Oh, my God, it's him!  Come on.  Come on.  Who had to get it?  Was that Anthony?  No.  I think that was open.  Oh, my God.  You know it was for Sandy.  Okay.  I'll buy that.  Okay.  All right.  That's fair enough, right?  Fair enough.  Okay.  Sure.  Very good. 
[00:08:00]  Okay.  Are we understanding each other?  Sort of.  Well, I'm still in litigation.  Oh, my God.  So, it's someone else's CD collection that happens to be in your car.  What's his name?  You jerk off, man.  You are the worst.  All right.  We were just having fun, and all of a sudden, I'm the S-wife. 
[00:08:30]  Wait.  Vito's checking in.  Vito?  Yo.  What's up, Vito?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, Anthony, I need my warrant CD back.  You guys suck.  Syndication now.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye, Bob.  Oh, man.  I got to just take one of these calls.  It wouldn't be fair if I did.  Fred.  Fred, what's up?  Oh, Ant's just a girl.  Frag.  You're a frag.  Come on. 
[00:09:00]  I knew it.  Ben just can't keep a secret.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, what's up, man?  I got those Yanni tickets you wanted there.  Easy.  Smart.  I actually went to see Yanni at the beach.  Ah, okay.  And we're going to be honest here today.  What happened there?  Oh, you're so hot, Anthony.  Ass.  Yeah, Yanni.  I feel like I get a little culture in my life.  A culture? 
[00:09:30]  No, that's a few years back.  Yanni.  What was the worst show you ever saw?  Ooh.  Ooh, that's...  Let me see.  I saw REO Speedwagon.  Jackson Brown.  Oh.  I had to see Jackson Brown.  That was pretty bad.  Yeah.  Look at Spaz.  Spaz just ran out of here.  He almost knocked Matt over.  All right, let's go to Rob.  Rob, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  I called you guys yesterday.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Hey, Opie, did you have to go jet skiing with Ricky Martin to get the CD sent?  All right, easy.  We just asked to find people at Sony to help me out for a Christmas present.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the truth, man.  That's the truth, man.  Yeah, you're not off the hook either.  Going to see No Doubt.  You're going to wear some suspenders and checkered pants.  Ant's going to dye his hair.  He's going to put a little purple in it.  That's going to be cool.  Oh, come on.  I'm just going because Gavin might be there.  Come on, man.  All right, Rob. 
[00:10:30]  Disappointing me, guys.  Thank you.  Oh, come on.  Are you getting pounding on the instant feedback yet?  Rob from Long Island.  Hey, Ant, maybe Lilith Fair will hit town soon.  You better get your Backstreet Boy tickets before all your homo friends get them first.  Anthony, are you looking forward to the Mike and the Mechanics reunion?  It just sucks when you say something on the show.  I guess it's Ant's turn in the barrel today.  Yeah, yeah.  You couldn't take Ben to the side and say, hey, Ben, don't tell anyone, but I really need No Doubt tickets. 
[00:11:00]  Ah.  Ant, I just got a call.  Your Barry Manilow tickets are cool.  Shut up, Barry Manilow.  Jerry, what's going on?  I hear Amba might be getting back together.  People are pounding me, you bastards.  Getting severely pounded on this.  What else are they saying on the instant feedback?  Oh, God.  I'm with the fag police. 
[00:11:30]  I want a warrant for Anthony's apartment to search for Liza Minnelli CDs.  I'm just glad it's not my turn today.  I don't think I can handle it today.  Hey, Ant, you going to the No Doubt show with Gay Marco?  You know, Gay Marco hasn't called us in a while.  No doubt, Anthony's a fag.  You suck, man.  All right, you got it queued up, Mark?  What, the tape? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, queued up the tape.  Oh, you want the tape?  No, I want to check it out.  I was going to say it.  All right, yeah.  What is Nick Carter calling for?  No, it's, uh, I don't think it's that Nick Carter.  Oh.  I think it's, uh, a different Nick Carter.  Oh, I thought it was our buddy in, uh, Boston.  No, it's, uh...  Oh, all right.  Uh, Nick.  Hello?  Yeah.  I'd like to invite Anthony down to my special show.  I'm from the Backstreet Boys, and I'd like to show them what I've got playing in my pants.  Great.  I want you sideways. 
[00:12:30]  Okay, very, very funny.  Very good.  Just hysterical.  That was great.  All right, Ant, time's up.  Very good.  You handled yourself quite well there.  Thank you.  I made the mistake of actually trying to explain myself the first couple of minutes.  Oh, yeah.  I realized I was completely insane.  You never explain anything on the show.  You just take it.  Yep.  Going to No Doubt.  All right.  Okay.  That's it.  Okay, then.  Okay.  Okay, good.  Uh-huh.  You looking forward to hearing this, uh, this song? 
[00:13:00]  Sure.  I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise.  Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?  This world is forcing me to hug your head.  Everybody.  I'm just a girl.  A little love of me.  We deliver keggers.  We deliver keggers. 
[00:13:30]  Vanessa, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Anthony, I like No Doubt, but, you know, I'll get you a George Foreman grill if you go to see Barbara Streisand.  I'm Barbara Streisand.  What do you think?  Get out of here.  What are you, insane?  Barbara Streisand.  All righty.  George Foreman grill.  Thank you.  I got the reference.  Thank you, Vanessa.  Bye.  All right, bye.  All right, Anthony, let's take a quick break, and we'll be back, okay?  Please.  All right.  O.P. 
[00:14:00]  Anthony.  We have our penises.  Thank you, all of our speaking remarks.  You can hear all the talking for us.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P.  Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  B.A.W.  Look in my eyes.  What do you see?  The comfort of the sea I see.  I know your anger. 
[00:14:30]  I know your dreams.  I've been the thing I want to be.  Oh, I'm a cult of personality.  A cult of personality.  A cult of personality.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Howie.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I was just wondering if Earl's show is going to start late in honor of Black History Month? 
[00:15:00]  Ring the bell.  Ouch.  Yeah.  Why don't we get the Black Earl show?  Earl, are you ready?  Salvage our career and move on.  Are you ready to rock?  I was born ready.  All right.  So we should fill everyone in.  It's Black History Month.  Whitey gives the black man the shortest month of the year to celebrate their heritage.  I don't understand that.  So we've got a problem with that, Earl, or are you happy with February? 
[00:15:30]  Take what you can get.  There you go.  So we'd fight the power.  We figured we'd give Earl some time.  Yeah.  To give his views.  Not only that.  I mean, you know, Earl, very interested in getting a show featuring black rock artists on  NEW.  And he's been pitching this for a while.  And it sounds cool.  A year.  And now we're going to give him a few minutes, play a few songs, do a little conversation,  maybe take some phone calls about the songs, the music, Black History Month, whatever Earl 
[00:16:00]  wants to talk about.  It's his show.  Right, Earl?  I'm a cyclist.  Play some music.  Well, you've got to do a little more than that.  Yeah.  We're going to give you the airwaves, and you've got to do a little intro.  Okay.  Maybe a little something-something about Black History Month.  Mm-hmm.  And then you intro your first song, and then after the song you talk a little bit, maybe  take a phone call.  Christ, you sound so white.  Something-something.  Something-something.  Something-something.  We have an intro for Earl's show, Anthony. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Should we start with that?  Woo-hoo!  Pardon the interpretation, but in honor of Black History Month, we're going to bring  you Black Earl on 1027 WNEW.  Oh, my God! 
[00:17:00]  You know what I'm talking about.  Holy jeez.  Nigga, please!  Come on, how about a good old nigga work song?  Oh, no!  I'm Big Dick Black.  I'm the invisible man.  You don't want to hire niggas, that's all.  I'm Big Dick Black. 
[00:17:30]  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggas, chikes, wops, or greasers.  Okay, brother.  Bear checker.  I'm Big Dick Black.  I'm telling you, just watch my...  The next man makes a move, the nigga gets it.  Oh, lordy lord, he's desperate. 
[00:18:00]  Do what he say.  Do what he say.  Help me, help me, help me.  Somebody help me.  I got it from a Negro.  I got it from a Negro.  I got it from a Negro.  Oh, I'm bad.  I'm bad.  It's not true.  I'm bad.  You're a nerd.  And the whole world has to be some right now.  Do they kill you once again?  Ouch. 
[00:18:30]  I am stupefied.  I'm totally stupefied.  This is 1027 WNEW.  Black Rock Coalition Radio.  This is Earl Douglas on the air.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  I knew it was my turn of the barrel.  I just knew it.  But we're going to play some...  Not bad.  Hey.  Let's go while we're young.  We're going to play some music right now. 
[00:19:00]  The idea about the show is to feature artists of color who happen to rock out and...  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Artists of color who, you know, they don't do traditional R&B or hip-hop or what have you.  But they rock out a little bit.  And they generally don't get the exposure that they deserve.  And pretty much in honor of Black History Month, which is a month that celebrates African-American culture, artists of color. 
[00:19:30]  Well, all that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  We decided...  Oh, God.  We decided to feature some music...  Shut up!  Some music from artists of color who go beyond the norm. 
[00:20:00]  So we decided...  We picked out a couple of songs and, you know, we'll take a couple of calls a little bit later on and...  Stock that chink a day's pay for napping on the job.  Yes, sir.  Play clips from Blazing Saddles.  And, you know what?  Let's take a couple of calls.  Let's pick up line seven.  Hello, you're on the air.  Hey, how you doing?  How are you?  I wanted to know about Blacks that have their birthdays in this month.  It's my turn in the barrel, isn't it? 
[00:20:30]  So we're going to play some music.  Let's hear some Fishbone.  Everybody loves Fishbone.  And this is from their 1993 album, ironically titled, Give a Monkey a Brain.  And he swears he's the center of the universe.  So let's hear some Fishbone.  On any W.  Yeah!  I did you!  The Lord!  It's now!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:21:00]  Yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Coming up from the south

[00:22:00]  Come on, come on  I'll die and I'll die  I'll die and I'll die and I'll die  Yeah, I'll die and I'll die  It's like you, swimming around  I'll die and I'll die  Up the fire  And down the mellow  Time will make me move 
[00:22:30]  Just a little  And I'm back in a mess  Dreaming to lie in time to grab my hand  I'll break the sack of luck  Whoa, whoa, this was a pain  And then I had a golden  I'd like to swear  1027 WNEW Black Rock Coalition Radio

[00:32:00]  So why is it that they always cop black culture?  They wear the pants.  They want...  They want to...  You two are brutal.  Okay, terrific.  I made a funny, son, and you're not laughing.  But that's a serious question.  How would you like to move my lawn?  Huh?  That's a serious question.  Line seven, Lewis.

Yeah, we can play Charlie Pride and Charlie Pride.  Hey, you know why white people like to look black?  Because we can get old white people to be afraid of us also.

[00:35:30]  Ouch.  Ouch.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Eddie Murphy is not my all-time favorite artist for the record.

I don't know why these guys are ragging on you like that,  Well, that's just them being them.  Thanks for the call.  We're going to get to some music now.  Here is Living Color.

You know, usually I really feel bad for you when the guys make funny and all, but you're  killing us.  There's a 24-hour pileup here on the parkway, and we're all asleep at the wheel.  You've got to stop.  Let it go for the day.  You've got 27 more days.  Let it go.  Let them come back, please, for the love of God.

I'm going to take another call.  I'm going to do some music here.  Yeah, let's get some music on. 
[00:40:00]  Here's some Living Color.  No, this is We Are The World.  I got it from a Negro.  There comes a time...  It's 1027 WNEW. 
[00:40:30]  Hello, you're on the air.  Earl.  Yo, what's happening?  I think this is a great thing you're doing with this Black History Month.  I just walked out of the video store.  I rented Roots.  I'm going to go home and play it backwards so it has a happy ending.  Have a good one.  Thank you, Anthony.  Now, I know I'm getting set up here, but here's... 
[00:41:00]  We're going to get back to some music here, and please play something, please.  Living Color on 1027 WNEW.  Hey, where are the white women at? 
[00:41:30]  Goodbye, baby.  Goodbye.  Hang it in a joy.  Goodbye.  Oh, oh.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  It's 1027 WNEW.  Thankfully, we're going to wrap this thing up.  And I want to thank my good friends, Opie, Anthony, and Rick, and Ben, who I'm probably going to kill after the show. 
[00:42:00]  And please address all letters to Jeremy Coleman, Carol, WNEW, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106, because I know we'll get them.  So, mercifully, we're going to end this. 
[00:42:30]  I just want to, seriously, I want to apologize for everyone, to everyone at the BlackRock Coalition.  I did not see this coming.  I am so, so, so, so, so sorry.  Thank you very much for listening and enduring, and take care.  We finally got a piece of the pie. 
[00:43:00]  Coming this spring.  On the Octopian Anthony Show.  Bikini Softball 2.  The Return of Wow.  Kim Norton's World Tour.  Sex for Sam.  Wow Stop.  All coming this spring.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  WNEW.  It's hard to find.  It's hard to find.  Especially when you're bothering me.  I'm trying to find.  It's hard to find.  It's hard to find.  It's hard to find.  It's hard to find.  Please don't help me.  I just find.  Now I feel.  You can control me.  It's hard to find. 
[00:44:00]  It's hard to find.  I just find.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's F.U. Friday.  Yeah.  We're playing What the Hell is That today.  All the doctors are here and some of the people have started arriving  that want things diagnosed beautiful.  We're helping again.  Again we help.  We have an ex-Playboy model. 
[00:44:30]  Awesome.  Who's now a doctor?  That never happens.  Wow.  She's smoking though.  And she was on Temptation Island, the first one or the second one?  Yeah.  First one.  The really?  Yeah.  What is that?  We'll get her in here, man.  Look at the hotness in the studio right now.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Wait, doctors don't wear leather outfits like that?  Well, I don't wear this to work.  I wear this jacket, but I thought I'd get a little more interesting for her. 
[00:45:00]  What kind of doctor are you?  Just your basic general practitioner?  Family practice.  Family practice.  Yeah.  It's a specialty.  You know, it took...  That's great.  ...three years after med school to do it.  I've got to ask you something.  When you get a boy, you know, mid to late teens that come in and they have personal problems,  it is a little weird for them to, you know, pull their pants down and...  Well, they have no choice because I'm allowed to say, you know...  Pull your pants down.  Yeah.  But you know something?  I don't know if it's weird for them or not.  They don't really say anything. 
[00:45:30]  When you're checking for that hernia, turn and cough.  I don't do it that way.  No?  How do you do it?  What do you do?  No, I mean...  A couple of drinks?  No, I just don't make them turn.  Wow.  You're not going to cough on me from three feet above?  I had a goddamn German doctor as a pediatrician when I was a kid.  Obviously.  And Dr. Fuchs.  And she would be like, take your pants down!  And it was the most like this big Helga woman, you know? 
[00:46:00]  How old was she?  Oh, she was...  Older lady?  Especially when you're a kid, she might as well have been a million.  Right.  It didn't matter.  Right, right, right, right.  You know?  But I couldn't imagine walking in and going, oh my God, this is the doctor.  Now I've got to show my short prepubescent schlong toe.  Some of them tried to refuse when I was seeing kids, but they really couldn't.  What idiots.  What about the adult men that come in that aren't really shy and they want to show you  maybe something they have under their underwear or something? 
[00:46:30]  It's a little weird.  Only a few times do they ever seem to be too excited.  Really?  Did that happen?  Yeah.  What, do you give it the flick?  Pong!  No, you're just supposed to sort of acknowledge, oh, I guess everything's working okay.  And, you know, not pretend like you don't see it.  Right.  Hey, want a tug?  Yeah.  You know, something like that.  I knew some nurse, and she said sometimes the guys would be aroused when she would come  along, and she wouldn't think twice about it.  She would just take her middle finger and use it to flick, you know, and just go, poink, 
[00:47:00]  and it would go away instantly.  Really?  She wouldn't talk about it, wouldn't say anything, and just go, poink, and then sucked  away.  And it would go away?  I never heard that.  Oh, instantly.  Yeah.  Maybe it was just her.  I don't know.  Well, I hired her for one night, and she wore a nurse's outfit, so.  What?  Maybe I'm speaking out of turn here.  No, but a very, very nice doctor.  We don't even know her name.  We don't know what she has done in the past.  My name.  Yeah.  My name is Allison.  Uh-huh.  Dr. Allison?  What have I done in the past?  Well, you were on Temptation Island.  I was on Temptation Island once. 
[00:47:30]  You were on Temptation Island.  Yeah.  Why don't I remember that?  I stayed on to the end.  My hair's all, like, curly and messy, because we were in the jungle humidity, so.  I'm trying to remember this.  I watched that show religiously.  I stayed on to the end, went on the final dream date in the cave.  You were the cave.  I was the cave.  The girl in the cave.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  With Kaya.  With Kaya.  Why did you take Kaya, my boyfriend?  That woman.  Oh, my God.  I need to take my hundred vitamin pounds.  She was crazy.  She's absolutely crazy.  That date she went on.  That poor son of a bitch that got stuck with her. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, Dano.  The boy's the best guy.  He's my friend.  Yeah.  All I can think about is Kaya.  Kaya's great.  She'd go walking around like, uh, uh.  We were huge fans of Temptation Island on the first one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because it was just such a mess.  I loved it.  You were the one, like, they were swimming and stuff, and they had a slow motion shot of  you, like, hair-flipping hair-flipping hair-flipping hair-flipping hair.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  You were the hottest one.  That was me with the hair-flipping hair-flipping hair.  But I was like, I want to leave.  The lab coat is throwing you off a little bit in the lack of tan.  Nice.  No tan, right. 
[00:48:30]  It's like, wait.  But, I mean, the body's still there.  Still there.  Wow.  Wow.  That's cool.  She went on the dream day with Kaya in the cave.  That's cool.  And I never forget about it.  Sounds like Lisa Orban went on that.  She has herself convinced that he never kissed anyone there.  And it was funny, because on the reunion show, they show, as she's saying that, in the background  over her shoulder, him kissing, like, two different girls, you know.  And she's like, well, he was a perfect gentleman.  Oh, God.  What about you?  Did he try anything?  Did he make any moves?  Yeah.  Was he really looking to close the deal?  Well, I won't say exactly what happened in the cave. 
[00:49:00]  No.  But they really did take the cameras away for 12 hours.  They did?  Yeah.  And people think, like, we're making that up or stupid because you see footage of it.  Well, they had him on us when we got there.  And then once we were there, they took him away.  And then we were freaking out, like, all right, where do they have them hidden?  Like, we were, like, tearing apart, like, the whole canopy we had.  Oh, really?  Now, why would you be doing this?  We wanted to know if we were on camera.  A little privacy?  Yeah.  Was there anything more than kissing?  Yes.  There was something a little more than kissing?  I won't say. 
[00:49:30]  Nice.  Look at you.  Because you go from kissing, the next thing is, you know, maybe some hand action.  I don't know.  You can't say.  I don't know.  I can't say, but did any, would you have heard this?  Norton, you are despicable.  The woman's a doctor.  We drank some champagne.  I don't know.  Did you?  Yes.  Very good.  You know what you mean?  Very good.  The white foamy stuff?  Yeah.  I don't know.  How many caves were being explored?  Oh, God.  You are despicable.  I think there were slag fights, too. 
[00:50:00]  Some big slag fights.  Well, you're a beautiful lady.  You also were in Playboy?  In 1995, in the Women of the Ivy League issue.  Nice.  I love those issues.  The college girl issues.  I was in med school, so they didn't love it.  God damn.  Where is that?  So you're a real Ivy League girl?  Because I always thought that was fake.  Yeah.  I was in med school at Penn at the time.  And I went to Penn State for college, so I've been to, like, both.  Hey, anybody, instantly give us that picture on the internet.  It's on my old website.  People are so resourceful. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, it's not up on your website now?  It's not on the new one.  The new one's, like, sort of the professional one.  It's on the old one.  It is?  Is that address still there?  Yeah, I can.  Oh, write it down.  It's too complicated.  Just, yeah, write it down.  Don't give it out, because our listeners have to wait.  Ha, ha.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, wait.  Write this down.  Isn't this, this is great.  She's liking everything.  She's a professional woman.  She was on Temptation Island.  She did a little more than just kissing.  She was definitely the hottest girl on Temptation Island, and Kaya was stupid to go back to 
[00:51:00]  that whining bitch and blow you off.  Oh, yeah.  You know, he wanted to, they all wanted to stay with their girlfriends.  They didn't want to look bad, because they wanted to go into entertainment.  Right.  And they would have looked totally scuzzy to be like, oh.  Are all the couples still together?  Do you know offhand?  Well, Kaya and Valerie are together.  I don't think White Temptation and Taheed were ever really good.  No, they were, the black couple, they were hilarious.  All I know, yeah, they were a mess.  And they weren't even included in the reunion.  And then Billy, Mandy, apparently aren't. 
[00:51:30]  And Shannon and Andy got married.  But they wanted to do that from day one of the show.  All right.  So are you trying to be an actress, or are you going to do the doctor thing for a while?  I would like to be doing more medicine and media.  Combine those two.  Medicine and media.  Yeah.  I'd like to be some sort of funky Dr. Drew thing, you know.  You're doing it today with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  This is good.  You're going to see some horrific sights today.  Oh, I can't wait.  We may show you something that you have never seen before.  No. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It's something called Twato.  What?  Twato.  Twato.  Did you make that one up?  No.  Well, it's a...  I think that one's made up.  We think it's a genital wart, but we're not sure.  Well, it's not called Twato.  Huh?  We thought it would.  It might be honest.  Well, we just, no, we just call it that because of Twato.  We named it.  You see Total Recall?  No, I think we named it.  You ever see Total Recall?  Ooh.  Total Recall.  I'd get you ass to Mars.  I might have fallen asleep during this.  Yeah.  Well, the guy had a conjoined twin named Quato that knew all, told all. 
[00:52:30]  Like a parasitic twin sticking out?  Yeah.  Okay.  So we call it a Twato.  Like a little head or something.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Parasitic twin.  That's it.  Conjoined twin is the full deal.  That's when you've got a full deal.  I love doctors.  I would love her to be my doctor.  I can't find that website, by the way.  I don't think it's active anymore.  Oh, well, sometimes it gets too much business and they shut it down because it's on a free server.  Well, you know what?  One of our listeners has to send a picture, please.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Somebody probably has it.  From the 95 issue.  Yeah.  Oh, you know where else it is?  I'll write it down.  My friend has a website.  Oh, you write that down now.  There we go.  Get that website, Rick.  Yeah.  Penn State tried to sue him for it, but they didn't.  Did you find the picture, Ann?  We're still working on it.  I see a lot of party pictures.  I see you with a chubby guy with a huge beer in his hand.  Yeah, that's Mick.  He's a really nice guy.  I see you.  Wow.  With a little top on it.  Some big outdoor shindig. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, that's Preakness.  That was a couple of years ago.  Wow.  You know something?  The top you are wearing right now is very deceiving.  It is?  Yeah.  Let me see.  It is?  Sort of.  They're squished in there.  You could see.  You could tell.  Yeah.  You could tell, but when you look at something like that.  I don't want to come in naked or anything.  This?  Oh, believe me.  We wouldn't argue.  Yeah.  Turn it around, Anthony.  Please.  Look at that one.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Oh, that's a horrible picture. 
[00:54:00]  You've got to check out the old website when it's not being blocked by Yahoo.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Look at that picture of you.  What's that?  Turn it around, Anthony.  That one.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  That's the picture.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That's from Playboy, huh?  Yeah.  Were there others?  Yeah.  Playboy had posted them up on their website.  After I was on the show, they put up like 11 more from the main shot.  They did.  Yeah.  Of course, I made no money off of it, but you had to pay to see them. 
[00:54:30]  That's a great shot there.  Yes.  Looking good.  Kurt, what's going on?  No, no.  I was just looking at the picture.  It ain't nothing.  She ain't naked.  What are you talking about?  I'm looking at the Playboy.  It's October.  October 95.  The one where she's on her belly?  Yeah.  Well, you get to see the nice butt.  Yeah, but no nip.  Yeah, right.  Technically, it's not nude, which is really funny.  Technically, that's not nude.  Semi-nude, as you can see, full nudity is pubic hair.  It's barely spackable.  I am not nude.  Barely spackable.  You can imagine a batch all over that butt. 
[00:55:00]  The cheeks are amazing.  I was in med school at the time.  You're easily pleased.  So you could bring that Playboy issue home to mom and dad and be proud.  Hey, Kurt.  That's all they gave it to me.  Hey, Kurt, you faggot.  Hey.  Use your imagination, man.  Look at her ass.  The whole page is covered with nude chicks, and she's not nude.  That's a great ass.  She's a doctor, though.  To see a doctor's hiney like that, that's so nice.  Oh, please.  It's a nice hiney.  Nice hiney.  You sound like a four-year-old.  Kurt, there's nothing wrong with leaving some for the imagination.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Hey, go get a copy of Swank and look at roast beef falling out of places.  You nuts.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, O.N.  Yeah.  I've seen the issue.  That's pretty much what you guys have just been talking about.  She's definitely really hot.  But the thing is, I think she has a second issue also.  I think she did it twice.  Is that true, Alton?  No.  Did you ever show the breasts there?  Because we're now seeing some other shots of you where you're more naked and kind of covering up the top area. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, those were the other Playboy ones from the same sheet.  No, she was naked in Temptation Island.  Oh, yeah.  It's good to see it, though.  Right, they didn't show it.  We went semi-skinny dipping one night.  But every time I got out of the water, I had them covered, though.  Very nice.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  No, thanks, guys.  Please.  All right.  Oh, what website's that?  There's more pictures of you.  I don't know.  I'm putting in passwords now.  There's all kinds of stuff going on.  I found them on, like, Russian porn sites.  Here it is. 
[00:56:30]  Let me see.  But she said there's no naked pictures of her.  Completely naked, Anthony.  No, no.  There's not naked.  Just about.  Wow, that's pretty good.  There's a shot of you.  Your leg is up.  See, those were the regions.  You're bending over.  Your arm is just covering nip.  All right.  A lot of the doctors are hitting on you.  No.  No?  Not where I'm working now.  Or maybe they are.  At the gay hospital?  Where are you working?  Yeah.  Geez.  Gay hospital.  Well, I work at 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., so it's really late at night. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Just imagine what you can accomplish during those hours.  Those are the times you can push her into the pharmaceutical closet.  There's not much security around.  I'd constantly be showing up for checkups.  Sorry, I got that on your shoes.  Yeah, but you have to be sick enough to get admitted to the hospital.  Oh, he's the sickest you're ever going to see.  I mean, just look at him.  Did you check my prostate with your fist?  Are we going to spend this much time with all the doctors? 
[00:57:30]  Hell no.  Of course not.  She took him all the other time with the other doctors.  Yes.  Oh, they're going to be mad at me.  No.  All right.  Well, she's going to help us today with what the hell is that.  Now, are you ready for this?  Because I...  Yeah, I think so.  I saw some of the people out there.  Yeah.  Now, you're probably pretty familiar with people that are coming in and going,  hey, what is this?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, family practice.  So you'll be able to give like a little, you know, little recommendation, maybe.  A little guess, something like that.  So there's not an actual diagnosis.  No, it's not a diagnosis or anything. 
[00:58:00]  Right, right.  Probably you could tell people, hey, go to a doctor and have this checked out.  I believe it's this.  Yes.  And something like that.  I understand.  All right.  Well, sure.  We're going to talk to the rest of the doctors.  And then I think we should start the festivities.  Yes.  Right.  We have a few people standing by and we'll have them come in and they'll strip and do  whatever they have to do.  And the doctors will take a look in the uncovering there.  I've never seen a naked person.  Yeah.  Okay, doctor.  All right.  We'll be back in just a bit.  I gots the cheddar.

[00:59:00]  Looking for you to start a fight.  There's an evil feeling in our brain, but it's nothing to do.  We know we're droughts.  Run it, I know we had it  You will be tired, a thousand years  Run it, I know we had it  You will be tired, a thousand years  So damn, she can destroy 
[00:59:30]  So damn, she can destroy  Let me get the doctors in here  We met the lovely Dr. Allison  Also helping us today, Anthony, is Dr. Mike  A guy that just wants to be called Doc  And Dr. Rich  The doctors, look at that  It's like a soap opera  The doctors  Hey, why don't the guys dress up in their leather outfits like Dr. Allison there? 
[01:00:00]  What do you think of Dr. Allison, guys?  You see many like her around?  Oh, yeah, the hospital  You got to talk into a mic, sir  The hospital's loaded with women like that  Right, yeah, sure  As he rolls his eyes  She's like the TV type doctor  The ones that you never see in real life, you know  When they got to take your temperature the old-fashioned way  It's usually some heifer  Now, Dr. Allison, the hot one  She's a family doctor  What are you guys? 
[01:00:30]  Internal medicine  Internal medicine  Oh, okay  Physical medicine and rehab  We do neuromuscular, musculoskeletal  All right  Emergency medicine  Emergency medicine, there you go  We got some emergency cases right here  Anyone else?  Did we miss anyone?  Ah, yeah, yeah, that's it  Okay  Doc doesn't want to be on the mic  I hear you  All right  Should we start the festivities?  Sure  Yeah, let's bring in our first case  It's Danielle Clark  Rick's the bitch that's usually at reception  Danielle has huge, huge breasts 
[01:01:00]  Huge breasts  Wow  They never call your name  Hi  Hi, Danielle  Hey, how you doing?  I'm all right, how are you?  Good  Now, where are you from?  Ariel, Sicklerville, New Jersey  Of course  Yeah  I was there last week, I think  Yes  It's over by Philly  We have to mention the obvious  You've got huge, huge breasts  Yes  Huge  How big are they?  Well, last time they were checked  They were double G's  Double G's  Like good God  Yeah  Hell yeah  And you call us to tell us  That you might have an extra 
[01:01:30]  Nip  Nip  Nip  Well, there you go  This is  Doctors, do you see a lot of this?  Is this a common thing?  It's very common  Very common  People think it's a mole  A lot of people think it's a mole  And it turns out to be a second or third nip  Why are the doctors smiling?  You guys are loving this, aren't you?  I don't think we need to touch it, you know  Now, doctors, I've heard about this before  And usually, don't they follow a line up and down?  Exactly  Actually, down from 
[01:02:00]  Oh, really?  What is that called, doctor?  It's called the milk line  The milk line, yes  It's down from the groin  Right  But it's never  Like, you wouldn't see one in the middle of a chest  No, never  No Cyclops nip or nothing  That's only in, like, the globe or the star  I don't know  Or Total Recall again  If I may bring up that fine movie again  Okay, so where is yours?  It's right under the left one  That means you're going to have to take off the sweater and the shirt  I can just lift right here  With the size of those  That could be anything from a third nipple to a pinto 
[01:02:30]  That's nice  She's taking her shirt off  Very professional here  Let's keep this professional, guys  No oohing and aahing  Of course not  When she lifts her top off  All right, go ahead, Daniel  Because this is, of course, we're just trying to  Are we doing this now?  Yeah, don't be shy  We're trying to  This is all professional  Oh, my God  I think we need the light on  Yeah, get the light on there  Doctors all take a look  They're all looking at me  How long have you had this?  I've pretty much got my boobs 
[01:03:00]  And this is an areola here also  I see around there  Can you actually bring out the other  The real one  The one that's above that  So we can compare the two?  No, I'm not taking out my whole boobs  Oh, jeez, I tried, Opie  Prove  What do you think that is?  Well, see, we don't want to say we're diagnosing it  No, no, it looks like that's what it is  You're going to give an opinion  Hi, Dr. Allison, what do you think?  I think that is a supernumerary nipple  Supernumerary  Supernumerary 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, that's what it's called  Is that what it looks like?  Well, we know her boobs are super  Yeah  Now, are these functional, doctor?  Sometimes people have a lot of tissue  And they can get  They can lactate?  They can, yes  How about that?  How about that?  And what do the other doctors say?  Doctors, do you concur?  100% correct  Yeah  Concur  Concur  Absolutely  I like, look how professional this is  It's moving along  I love this  Wipe the smiles off your faces  I, too  I, too, concur 
[01:04:00]  I don't  Norton, what do you think?  What do I know?  I think that the doctors are correct  What do you think of her boobies there?  We didn't get to see much  We couldn't see them  Yeah  We saw the one little car  I would have liked to have compared the one  Yeah, docs, what are you doing to us here?  Don't you need to compare or something?  You may have to do the full breast exam to really  Yeah  There's no extra tissue  Is there any future problems that can develop from something like this, doctor? 
[01:04:30]  That maybe she should be aware of?  You just want to get it checked like any breast tissue  Yeah  Yeah, that's hot when you say it  I'd like to see Dr. Allison check the breast tissue  Nice  And is there anything she could do for that?  No  Nothing?  You can get it removed  You can?  You can?  Would you like to actually?  Sometimes the scar ends up being bigger than that  Really?  It looks like a mold to anybody that can see it  Right  So you don't have a problem with it?  You wouldn't want to get it?  I've had it since  She's had it  She can't  She's had it forever, she says  I think you've got to get headphones on  Unless I'm like walking around lifting them up to you 
[01:05:00]  Right  And it's underneath  So it's not very obvious  Not many people get to see it  Right?  All right  Well, our first case  And is this a common thing, Doc?  Very common  Everyone actually is born with them  But they involute before you're born out of the universe  Involute  God, I love Dr. Tom  Did we just have the word involute on our radio show?  I love Dr. Tom  Nice  Someone's going to use that in the  What did we learn today?  They involute  Look out upper demos  Yeah  Here they go  Involute 
[01:05:30]  So we should use like words like they kind of  No, no, no, no, no  Trust me  No, that's okay  We need to sound more intelligent  So you use words like involute  Really?  You're kind of born with those?  And then they  Every human being has them all  And why do we have those when we're born?  Why do men have them for crying out loud?  I have no idea  Because they feel lovely when receiving treats  That's true  Because God's not sure it's going to be a dog yet?  We're like animals  It's the same exact thing  It's what the dogs have  Yeah, it's like the dogs have them all running down there  Well, we have tails too, so, you know  Some of us still do 
[01:06:00]  Let's ask Danielle  Are you happy with the opinions of the doctors?  Oh, yeah  I appreciate it  Thank you  At least I know for sure now what it is  All right  There you go  Our first case  Look at this  We're helping  I love it  Wait, that's nothing  We got some real freak shows  We're just warming up with that one  What, Rick?  Is it cancerous?  Is it cancerous?  No  Should it be at all?  Oh, my God, Rick  What an alarming word you want to throw in  Why would you take the hotness out of this?  Can she get AIDS from having that? 
[01:06:30]  Is there something?  All right  Should we get the next guy in before we take a break?  All right  Let's at least get him in and see  His name's Mike  Thank you, Danielle  Thank you, Danielle  Our first case  And what the hell is that?  It's been taken care of  The doctors will see you  Are we getting pictures?  The doctors will see you now  Look at how Rick  Is being in the reception  Are we getting pictures of all these guys?  Oh, yeah  All right  Where are you from, Mike?  Jersey  All right, right on  Another one from Jersey  There seems to be something happening  Another girlfriend that just walked out here  Oh, really? 
[01:07:00]  Yes  And now you have something  Yes, I do  All right, I'm afraid  I get fearful  Well, I see what he has on the chart here, Anthony  Oh, you're looking at his chart?  He's got a growth  Let's just say he's got a growth  He has a growth  Is it in the lower?  It's below the belly button, yes  Oh, my God  And above the knees  Oh, no  What?  Let me read his chart, Opie  All right  Give me his chart  Let me look  Hmm  There's Mike in his chart  Oh, my God 
[01:07:30]  This is not done in medical terminology  I know  You can't write it like that  Well, on his chart  Well, why don't you write it down for the doctor  So they can maybe clean it up a little bit  What's the medical term for  Yeah, yeah  See if you could  For that  For what?  See if you could  Word that in a way  That we can say on the air  On the air  A scrotal growth  All right  A scrotal growth  A scrotal growth  Okay  All right  Well, um  Oh, Jesus 
[01:08:00]  Right  I see the gloves are out  And on  Look at Mike  Mike is rubbing his hands together  Because he sees the hot Dr. Allison  Putting gloves on  No  Sight  Mike, you're sight, right?  Dr. Allison  You have to be called away from this  For a minute  No, okay  Um, well  I guess  She was on Temptation Island, you know  Oh, I know  Okay  All right, Mike  Uh  We'll watch some of those episodes  Well, I guess  Show the doctors  Your, uh  Your problem  Oh, no 
[01:08:30]  I can't look  Oh, my God  I can't look  He's very excited, though  Because, uh  Well, don't put it that way  I didn't mean it like that  All right  Okay  Doctor  He's, uh  Oh  Oh  Look at all  Oh, please  Yeah, it could be a skin tag  Yeah  Hopefully not a wart  You know  All right  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait  All right, all right  He just whipped out his yam bag  If I may use medical terminology  And now we've got to kind of describe it 
[01:09:00]  So that gets on the radio  It's, uh  And, uh  He's got a, uh  Growth of skin  Mm-hmm  That seems to be a dangling from, uh  It looks as big as, um  Like a raisinette, right?  Like the size of a raisinette  And, uh  It did get some  It's not as big as a raisinette  No?  It's pretty close  It got some gasps from, uh, people  Yeah  From some of the people  I think that was just the fact that he was showing us that area  Um  And now that you've had a chance to let it sink in  Uh, any, any opinions, uh  Of what this could be and what he should do 
[01:09:30]  Skin tag  Skin tag  A lot of people have on their necks  A growth type thing that  Skin tag  What the hell is that?  Just an extra piece of skin that grows off of somewhere  And can that be removed without a difficulty?  A problem?  You just snip them off  And I went to a doctor when I was like six or seven, I remember  And he was going to remove it  And I told him hell no  It was going anywhere near there with a knife  Well, well, well, you  You'd let a housing go next to that  Yes  Now, now, have you had a  A little Novocaine  And that comes right  A little Novocaine  Some people just, well 
[01:10:00]  Some people just snip it  Just cut them with the scissors  You can just pull it out  No, no kidding  Some people need to do them at home  All right, hold on  What do we got?  Cut it from their own neck  What do we got to give Mike, man?  We got scissors  Oh, my God  We got scissors  Don't do that  I think you should use Patty's toenails  From yesterday to cut it  Did you guys bring any tools today?  No, they're not going to be performing procedures  You can't do anything  Of course not  But they said they could cut it with a scissor  No, he could cut it with a scissor at home  We would recommend that  We would recommend, though  If you do cut it  We recommend that you see your doctor  To have it properly removed 
[01:10:30]  But save it  And bring it in  For what we are going to have  Let's just tell the people  We are thinking of having something  We like to call Cannibal Day  Cannibal Day  Here on the O.B.

[01:25:30]  Don't describe where it is  What it's doing  How it's talking  Or anything  Deed done  White  Right  Not that white though  Okay  Because he's not actually done  Right  Right  Very good  So  Doctors  Is this common  To have some kind of  A residue like that  There  I don't know  How specific I can get  There is such a thing  As a normal  Discharge  Yeah  That can be  White to clear  And if it's not  Smelly or itchy  It's probably okay  But if it's smelly  That's the problem  Alright 
[01:26:00]  Is that good  Is there an odor  To any of this  Byproduct  Nikki  Yeah  Absolutely  Alright  That should be checked out  Should be checked out  Sir  So what do I do  What do I say  What do you say  Wow  That is a tough one  Tell her it stinks  Yeah  In the words of Jim Nord  You stink  Just tell her that it smells  Like the toe webbing  Of a Haitian marathon runner  That smells good  Hey  I guess I just got to  Handle it on my own  Huh  Pretty much

[01:27:00]  Opie and Anthony  Need to talk to you  And see if she goes for it  I'll try that  Alright cool  Alright do that  Alright thank you  Alright take care  Bye  Bye  Alright  Wouldn't it be great  To just get on the phone  And go hey  Your aunt stinks  Don't you know it  Don't you know it  You're horrifying  The hot dog over there  The guys enjoy it  She probably knows it too though  Really  Just ignore it  Yeah  That's something  Girls should not ignore  And then they finally  Come in like yeah  It's sort of stinks  I mean they know I think  Oh boy  I think they know 
[01:27:30]  Can we change the subject  Yeah let's change the subject  Mike what's up  Sounds like that guy's  Dealing with a real  Haunted house  With hair on it  Haunted house  Well we don't know  What that means  So I hope they didn't  Dump out  Use your imagination  Of course  John from Boston  Has something  Have you ever heard of this  He has a growth  It's on his unit  But it only comes out  When he's urinating 
[01:28:00]  It's like inside  I guess the urethra  What the hell is that  The urethra prolapse  Of course  He goes and it flops out  Thread probably  And then it comes back in  When he's done  You've heard of that  The urethra prolapse  Is it a flag that says  Pow on it  God damn  This is sick  It's a flag that goes  Pow  Any private area stuff  It really is disturbing  It really is disturbing  Alright who's our next case 
[01:28:30]  Yeah we gotta move on  Flag that goes pow though  That'll make him giggle  All weekend  Bang  Okay  Does Heath have to eat  Yeah the wings just got here  So he's gotta eat a few  Alright  Why don't we bring him in  And he can eat in the corner  And he can tell us  When he's ready  Have him do that  When he eats hot food  He sweats on only half his face  And then when he works  He sweats out  He sweats on the other side  And each time the opposing side  Stays dry  What's up Heath  There's your wings from Hooters 
[01:29:00]  Oh I see the doctor's  Pulling out a flashlight  Are you gonna check his pupils  Yes  Oh see  Look at that  What would that mean  If he's sweating on one side of his face  And his pupils don't dilate  How long before you start sweating Heath  Very shortly  Oh okay  And then we can go with Heath  Alright  Now the hot  Those are some hot wings  Are they hot  Are they hot wings or not  Yeah  Yeah  It might take a minute  This is probably just some crafty guy  Who wanted lunch 
[01:29:30]  You know  And he's  Hey I need wings  Yeah that's it  Wings  Which side do you sweat on  The right side when I eat  Left side if I do something  Oh alright  So the doctors are already asking questions  Good  And you've heard about this  And you've diagnosed people that have this problem  There's a syndrome called Horner's syndrome  That you sweat only on one half of your face  Horner's syndrome  And something happens to that one eye  It's called meiosis and anhydrosis  So  It's a disease of the nervous system basically  Where part of the nervous system on one side of the face is blocked 
[01:30:00]  And it can cause damage to the nerves  You can actually be born with it  Or it can be acquired over time  Yeah  Yes  And is it serious?  Sometimes it's a tumor  Well it can be due to a tumor  But not always  I mean you can be born with it  Or you can acquire it  How long have you had this?  Actually I got into a motorcycle accident when I was younger  That actually explains a lot  Explains a lot of it  Yeah  It just started to happen  After the motorcycle accident  Did you fracture your spine?  Your cervical spine at all?  No  No  No damage 
[01:30:30]  If you damage your spine  You know  Like you said  If you had a whiplash injury  Any kind of damage  I broke a lot of bones  And had metal plates put in and stuff  But nothing in the neck  Nothing in the neck  That's where it would be common  Yeah  I might have had a little whiplash  But there's also a lot of people that have this  It's actually called hyperhidrosis  That's excess sweating  Yeah  And it can be  There's a surgical procedure that can be done on it  But most people  It would be better to live with it  Damn you  God damn Norton 
[01:31:00]  He just spins the book around  And I looked at it  Oh my god  He's sweating  Another cute picture  You son of a bitch  I don't want to see these open wounds on man junk  This book is like Playboy to these doctors  Oh no it's like Playboy to Norton  He doesn't turn us on  He's looking through it like  Oh yeah  Alright here  Look at that open sore on that mule  Wait Heath is sweating I think  Heath you feel like you're sweating  Oh yeah  Oh look  It's glazed on one side  Wait get under a light  Yeah get the light on  Dude that is amazing 
[01:31:30]  Look  That is effed off  He's glazed on one side  And on the other  That is effed off  Cyborg  Cyborg  Dr. Allison is getting a good look  What's going on with the pupils doctor  They're checking his eyes  A lot of times when the nerves are damaged  It would also affect the pupils  Right  You can actually see the pupils  One might dilate  The other one might constrict  And that would also confirm this type of syndrome  Something tells me that would be a little more serious than just the sweating  Wow  Am I right doctor?  Absolutely 
[01:32:00]  Yes of course  I shut my eyes  Norton  I'm not looking  I'm not looking  Have you guys seen this before  Docs?  You have  I have  Yeah  Is there anything he could or should do for this  Or  It depends on what it's from  Like  I don't mean to interrupt you  But the sweat is just dripping down the whole right of his face  And the left side is completely dry  Oh my god  He's like Whitney Houston on that side  He's sweating like a pig  Beads of sweat just pouring down the side of his face  You should legitimately go see a doctor  Because there is a tumor in the neck 
[01:32:30]  That can cause this  And you want to make sure that that's not what it is  Exactly  A lot of times  Something can compress these nerves  Causing this type of irritation on the nerves  So we really should go to a doctor  Just to get it checked out  Just get it  When was the last time you saw a doctor about anything about this  Or any other reaction to the motorcycle  It's been a while  It's been a while?  Yeah  Definitely  In general you never want to have anything that a doctor goes oh cool about  It is pretty cool though  Yeah that's something  He's just half and half  In explanation for when the  You know if I do something physical 
[01:33:00]  The other side sweats  That's odd  That's bizarre  This side will be  You never want to hear a doctor say that's bizarre either  The side will sweat just the same way  No idea what that is  But it's basically  It's like a misfiring in the nervous system  Right  And if there's like a tumor has been ruled out  Or any kind of real irritation  It's usually a benign condition that you know  Unless it's really bothering him  Just deal with it  He can live with it  Because like I said  They do have a surgical procedure  But most people are not doing it  That's called the Jim Brewer diagnosis 
[01:33:30]  Which is walk it off dick  Wow that's pretty amazing  Alright well  Sweating profusely on the right side of his face  And drying the left  You ate like two wings  Do you sweat on your whole body that way  Or is it just your face  You know what I don't think so  Like do you get wet under both arms  Definitely I'm sweaty though  Let me see  It's mostly the face and the underarms  Right  It usually just affects the face  Alright  It usually just affects the face  It can also affect like feet 
[01:34:00]  Certain people complain that  You know one foot is sweaty  How about that  Right guard right  Yeah right guard and left guard  There you go  Alright  Alright well there you go  Go have it checked out maybe  But doctor said cool  And that's bizarre  Which is something you always want to hear  From a doctor  Heath you rock  Yeah that was something  We might have to invite you  To the next road show  Yeah we'll just have you get on stage  With some cool lighting on your head  And have you eat some wings  That would be cool  I think we have to take a break  Before we get to John  That has something that's leaking 
[01:34:30]  Oh god  We have Mel  Wait is this leaking  Mel has a golf ball growth  That's all I'll say  Oh god  And ladies and gentlemen  Sandy Kane has entered the building  As the grand finale  We will finally put an end to the mystery  What is Twato  And we will do that before 6 o'clock  Definitely  Yeah  Because the hot doctor Allison  Has to get out of here by I think 5.30 or so  So we'll do it before 5.30  And then we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show  That's Opie and Anthony  1027  BNW 
[01:35:00]  I want you to be free  Don't worry about me  And just like the movies  We play out on a massive scene  Alien Air Farm movies  This is the Opie and Anthony show  We're hanging out with a bunch of doctors today  Anthony  God damn Norton man  During breaks  He finds the most disgusting picture in the book 
[01:35:30]  And I'm like reading over copy  Or instant feedbacks or what not  And he goes  Hey Ant  And I'll turn my head  And he's just holding it right up  So I gotta look  Bastard  Disgusting  The medical book is chock full of  I'm not looking  No  That's the best picture in the book right there  We should take a snapshot of that  And put it on the website  It's not nasty  It's just weird  No that's nasty and weird dude  I don't even know what it was supposed to be 
[01:36:00]  It's junk  That used to be junk Anthony  Tony from Jersey  I'd like to play skin tag with Dr. Allison  Very funny  The listener's digging  Dr. Allison from Temptation Island  And you guys are okay too  We had a couple more people come down  Yeah I'm waiting for Rick to give me the list  That's great  I guess we could invite John in  Who has something leaking from his body  Something leaking 
[01:36:30]  I don't like the sound of that  The gloves are being passed back around  Some more latex gloves being put on by the doctors  These doctors are good  Because some of the people coming in Anthony  They're like I don't need a glove  I know what it is  But then when you say something like  You know something leaking  They run for the gloves  Oh the gloves just come out  Hey John what's up  How you doing  Where are you from man  Queens  Cool  Just to clarify  It doesn't leak on it's own 
[01:37:00]  Like I have to squeeze it  Like I thought it was a pimple  But then it turned out it wasn't  Holy Jesus  I'm going to have this other thing on my arm  Like I call it the drug bump  Only one thing at each visit  Yeah that's how it works  Yes  You got to come back  We bill per visit  Another copay  Alright  A copay  What's the thing on your arm?  It's like a bump  I don't know  Like when I drink a lot  Like the next day it puffs out  So I thought it was a tick  Like I had Lyme disease  It's like it sucked the blood  And got bigger  When you drink  I don't know  I never got to check that  Alright 
[01:37:30]  Maybe when you're dehydrated  It shows up more  That could be what  When you find out too  There's nothing on your arm right now though  No it's like  Right below the surface  You can feel it  Alright they're feeling his arm Anthony  The inside is like the elbow  A little red bump  Ah they're already waving it off  Like it's nothing  It's not well circumscribed  It's not what?  It's not well circumscribed  Oh scribed  Yeah  Like you can't feel the edges of it distinctly  Right  I don't think  Is that good or bad? 
[01:38:00]  It's not well demarcated  Is that good or bad?  It's not demarcated  I didn't think so  And how big does it get?  I mean it puffs up a little bit like a mosquito bite  Oh really?  Maybe it just sticks out  Let's see the lead hydrate  I think it might be  Oh we're talking about the thing on his arm  Where's the leaky thing?  Get to the leaky thing  Well the leaky thing is the chest Anthony  Yeah  It's only on one side  I don't know  To make you funny  Like you can draw a bullseye on a piece of paper  I don't know  Like the last time I touched it  And drained it in the shower  But I probably could  No no no  Please let's not shoot anything 
[01:38:30]  No he's got to shoot  No no  Not in this close proximity to people  Hit the board over there  No  People  Don't work in here  Anthony it's for the show  Look if he's going to do something  I want plastic  I want  How about you  Rick hold up newspapers  I can hold up a paper  Put him over there in the corner though to do it  Exactly  Alright so John  You'll see  No we can see  Look at all the lights  Maybe you can cover us in plastic  And Gallagher can hit it with a mallet  Before you squeeze  I was squeezing yet 
[01:39:00]  Don't squeeze anything yet  Alright he's showing the area  Is that there or does it come out of the way?  This is the worst joke  Oh  Those are sweat glands there too  Go let's see  They get filled something  Alright  They get filled something  Oh my god  He's going to squirt something  In a cup  Hold on  I'm not looking  Wait move out of the way doc  Alright he's  He's uh  Oh  Yeah  Okay  Hold on  That was disgusting 
[01:39:30]  I think there's something right here  Wow  That was disgusting  Right here  Okay  That was impressive  Oh  My  God  Anthony  Describe that  It's always the same one  It's always the same one  Do that  Do it again  Do it again  Do it again  Oh that's all you have in there?  No this is  This is disgusting  He's got to reload  He's reloading  Oh  Now it's just kind of 
[01:40:00]  Wah wah wah wah  It's a money shot  Out of his uh  Nip  Yeah  Is what I'm saying  But milk does  Yeah but the milk comes from all over  Not just in the mail  Milk  Why are they saying milk?  Shit  Oh god I am so friggin disgusted  That's exactly  Alright  There are three doctors  Doctors  Milk  Do you take any medicines?  Are you crazy?  Do you take psych meds?  Sometimes people on psych meds can get it and stuff 
[01:40:30]  It's called galacteria  Galacteria  I love that movie  It was clear  It wasn't  Didn't look milk colored  It's gross but I haven't tasted it  It's salty  Oh my god  What are you crazy?  What are you insane?  And it tastes salty  Yeah  Why would you taste that?  I'm just curious  I don't know  The first time I noticed it I was like 14  Does it have to refill?  It has to refill  And then you can't just do it again  Yeah  It has to drink  It takes a while to come back  It reloads  Yeah  It's salty  That's a sweat gland 
[01:41:00]  That's what you think it is  You know my own sometimes  I'm just kidding  Tell us more  Yeah  But that's a sweat  You think it's a sweat gland  Yeah  As opposed to milk coming out of  Hold on  Can I  My observation though  They're saying it was clear  I didn't see clear  I saw  It was milky  Oh god  I want that cleaned up with Lysol  It's got like a yellowish tint to it  It's not white  It's not bloody  No it's not bloody either  Stinky  How impressive was that?  Jesus Christ 
[01:41:30]  Hey where did Ben go?  Ben left  Oh my god  Ben is probably vomiting  Didn't we make a bet  That Ben would leave the show by five?  Yes  Well alright  I have had it checked out once before  And they told me it's from smoking pot  No  No  That was the anti-pot people saying that  Smoke all the pot you want  Stinky will smoke some with you  One more time  No no no no  Enough  Did you guys get that on video?  Steve?  Yes  Steve got it on video  It will be up on foundrymusic.com 
[01:42:00]  That was cool  The underground website  You can get to it through opiateathlethly.com  You know people are enjoying  The hell out of Stinky Cam  And Brandon from New Hampshire  Is checking in  He said he just saw Dr. Allison  On the Stinky Cam  And now he has a growth  He wants her to check out  So  You know she's a trooper though  She comes in with a hot leather top  But she's very professional too  She's looking at the problems  These people have  And she's giving her opinion  On what it could be  And that's pretty cool  And there's a little inside joke  In the studio about the couch 
[01:42:30]  I had thought about it real quick  Before I sat down  And then the guy from the Navy  Came in  And was like  I wouldn't be sitting there  No I don't  No that's the idea  There's more diseases on that couch  Than on Stinky Cam  I'm not too worried about  Getting any diseases from it  You should see what has  Gone on on that couch  When you go around in public  I mean you know  Yeah  You know what  We've seen some crazy sights  So far today Anthony  John is the best so far  Yeah that's  Can I give my friend  The band the plug  Of course  Alright  Downpour.com  Everybody check it out  It's a good band  Nice 
[01:43:00]  Local band from Queens  They should rename the band  Leaky You Know What  Downpour  They named it after him  Yeah  Oh my god  That is something  Alright  So what are the doctors  Do you think you should  Have that checked out  I would still get it checked out  It's likely nothing  But there is a serious condition  That can arise from a tumor  In the center of your head  That makes your nipple  Leak like that  So I wouldn't be playing around  With something along those lines  Right  Right  The old tumor in the head  It's always best to be safe  And sorry  He's had it for a really long time too  Since 14 right  But that's why I thought  The first doctor was right 
[01:43:30]  Because that's about the same time  I started smoking  And John  Don't drink it anymore  Yeah yeah  Please  Keep it out of your mouth  Hey but for that  Other contest  The cannibal contest  Somebody wants to drink  Oh god  Well we might have to have you  Come down  Offer the beverage  For the people  Yeah we'll probably be fresh  We'll put it in the  In the cannibal stew  That we're going to be making  Oh god  I am so friggin disgusted  Let me go to Doug  From Springfield  Doug what's up  Oh you guys are nasty  This is better than  Stacker 2  I lost my appetite  Later guys 
[01:44:00]  How did that sound  On the radio  It went flying  Across the studio  He just squeezed it  A little bit  And boom  Did it smell like  Blue cheese dressing  Oh god  You want to play now right  Stop it  I don't want to play  Stop it  And Lisa has a question  For the doctors on the line  Lisa what's up  Yeah listen  I got to know  My regular gynecologist  About this  I have a white discharge  And it has a fishy smell  I think it's a vaginosis thing  My doctor keeps telling me  It's either a yeast infection  Or nothing 
[01:44:30]  Yeah  And like I feel bad  For my boyfriend  You know  I mean he's too nice  To say anything to me  And you know  I just  Yeah I know  We were just talking to him  What  Sorry  Oh no  And I just want to know  Like what antibiotic  I should ask for  And it depends what it is  I mean if it's  Trichomonas  Then you treat it  With flat  Well you can do  Slagil for BV  Yeah  But it  You know  It might not  You don't know  Necessarily what it is  And if it  A lot  We used to have  A lot of people 
[01:45:00]  Come in  With a white discharge  They thought  Were worried about it  And we would test it  PH test  Look at it  In a microscope  And it really was nothing  And it's hard  To convince people  That sometimes it is nothing  Sometimes it's nothing  The best way  So that can be normal  It's not normal  A white discharge  Yeah it just  It doesn't seem normal  You know  It's incredibly  You're a girl  Yeah foul smelling  Is not  But white  Just having a discharge  In and of itself  Is not  You have to ask your doctor  To do  And I'm not kidding you  It's called  The whiff test  They take the discharge 
[01:45:30]  The whiff test  Yeah the whiff test  You put it on a slide  And drop potassium hydroxide  On it  And smell it  You're a girl  Anthony I just  Figured something out  Yeah  Allison's actually  A doctor  Oh yeah  I thought she was  Faking it bro  Sure  That's great  Alright well John  You rock  Lisa thank you  Thanks man  Alright  Oh man

[01:47:00]  Whip this out  Not at all  Not a drop  Ok and you want  To describe that  I'm not looking  Ok you describe  It's more than  A golf ball size  Yeah  That could be  A vascular  Or a vascular growth  The way it's  What would that mean  It's not well  Circumscrised  But it can be  A lipoma  A vascular  A lipoma  Lipoma is rock  Does it ever get bigger  When you're  Are you talking about  The growth now  Or the other thing  I'm talking about  The growth  Ok  Wow  Ok it's not very 
[01:47:30]  It's shaped  Like again if I may  Bring up Rocky Dennis' head  It's not very  It's not like round  It's not smooth  It's got many little bumps on it  It's halfway up his inner thigh  It's not like encapsulated  Or anything like that  Do you think it's like blood vessels  In there  It seems more vascular  In nature  Yes yes  Blood vessels can actually  Grow awry  And form kind of  What he has in his thigh  It's more likely that  Than a lipoma  What's a lipoma  A lipoma is like 
[01:48:00]  Fatty tissue growth  Soft benign growth  You need to go get  An ultrasound done  They'll take a sound probe  Against it  And they'll tell you  Exactly  See if it's a boy  Or a girl  The ultrasound  Send me that probe  Send me that probe  But you'll see if it's hollow  Is it soft that thing  Yeah very soft  I'm not very soft  We never know  What we're talking about here  Do we  Wow that's something  And how long have you  Had that going  About a year  About a year  Yes  Never at all  It's not painful  Does it get in the way  Or anything  No not at all 
[01:48:30]  And did it start out small  And all of a sudden  It just  Or one day you woke up  And went whoa  It just  It was  Jeez  Like that Ray Millan  Rosie Greer thing  I just woke up  One day and there was  Ray Millan's head  Or Rosie Greer's head  Exactly  Yeah I hear you  How long have you had it  About a year  So is it serious  Doctors  Get it checked out  Especially if it's grown  That large that fast  Yeah yeah yeah  Just get it checked out  Don't matter

No I'm just kidding  Most likely not  Well I think you might have scared him a little bit  So maybe you should tell him that  He needs to get checked out  Of course  Anything like that  You should get checked out  Anything that grows to that size in one year 
[01:50:00]  I mean yeah  A year he's had  Yeah  If he had that for 15 years  It's one thing  But I mean  Look at the size of that thing  Yeah  Someone wants to know  If I could hit that  Into Central Park  Give it a whirl  Yeah  Alright  Rick what's next?

[01:51:30]  Wait you have bad eyesight  But you can see with glasses fine?  Eh kinda  And my shoes  My shoes  I'm all in it  Put my shoes down  There's so many things that can do that  There's about five different viral infections  There's something called Warren's ulcers  That eat away your eye  I've had this scar on my eye  For like years and years and years  I went into the Navy  And they  You know  Gave me a full exam  And they just like  Alright you have this  This and this  Sorry we have to kick you out

[01:57:30]  Oh my god  That isn't good  They're all in his mouth  It was all  It was all  Fun and games  All fun and games  Until someone has the big casino  But that's not what that is  That's  What is it  What  Oh my god  The doctor's just like shaking his head  Kind of like  Uh oh  Uh oh  Don't say anything  Don't say anything  How long have you been smoking sir  Two  Twenty years you've been smoking  You want to get your hand in there 
[01:58:00]  Oh my god  Sixteen years of smoking  Sixteen years of smoking  Oh my god  Okay  Let's get some slippers down here immediately  Where's Dr. Kennedy  He's going to do it  Yeah  There's still legs  Oh my god  Hell this  Seemed like a good idea  In the back office  Holy Jesus  The one guy  Doesn't even want to be part of it 
[01:58:30]  Oh  The one doctor  Has given up  Huh  Other side  Oh boy  Other side  Other side of the gum  Labial  Grab that mic  What do you think  Underneath  When in doubt  Cut it out  When in doubt  Cut it out  Oh my god  Cancer  Order slide  Have you quit smoking  Since you discovered it  Uh uh  Uh uh  Open his mouth  They're like really  Getting in there  Uh uh  Flashlights  I can see it in a mirror  Come on  You're supposed to be a doctor  Come on  Oh now he's all  I see  Give him that mic 
[01:59:00]  This guy  This guy doesn't want in on it  Doctor  Get over here  Take care  Talk a lot  It's a solid mass  Inside of his mouth  I mean  And it's growing  In a smoker  That's got to come out  And number one diagnosis  Until proven otherwise  But just  You know  Yeah  It's on the inside  Of his mouth  Alright  Oh  Do you see it?  It's right in here  Okay  Okay  He doesn't want anything  Uh oh  The doctor's feeling it  You need to have that checked  Oh boy 
[01:59:30]  Oh my god  If you check it  What do you  It's why people  Gin smoke  Right  Have you stopped smoking?  I'm a big guy  I'm smoking  Why didn't you just  Throw those god damn  Things away  Because I felt it  On the platform  Of the L.A.I.R.  Yesterday  Well see  Very good now  Very good  So you started smoking heavy  To get all your smoking in now  Have that checked out  Immediately  Well what is it?  We can't say exactly  What it is  But it definitely needs  To be seen by  An ENT  By who  By who 
[02:00:00]  Ear, nose and throat  Specialist  Okay  Someone who can  Properly diagnose you  With exactly what it is  I have good coverage  I need to know  Who I need to see about this  Yeah  Do you have a primary care doctor?  I have coverage  I'm covered  Okay  Because you need to go  To your primary care doctor  Wherever you're assigned to  Oh my god  Let him see that  And he'll make the arrangements  Before he sends you  Who the hell's the primary care doctor?  What do you think it is?  There could be a lot of things  That  Could be a lot of things  That come to mind  But it's something  That needs to be looked at  How about we give the top three  Especially being a smoker 
[02:00:30]  Especially being a smoker  My friend  See  You gotta throw those away  They're very bad for you  Why are they all  Giving the C sign?  What is the C sign?  Canker sore  Canker sore  No  I don't have any  Canker sore  Of course not  Once you hear that  Somebody's a smoker  Especially if they drink too  You worry that they have a cancer  In their neck  Because most head net cancers  Occur in smokers  That's a fact  So that's what you worry about  And it might not be  I figure they have to  Take a hack store  And cut like half my face 
[02:01:00]  No no  What you do now  Is have it checked out immediately  We don't even know what it is  You need to go get it checked out  I figure the worst  You know  Well better to figure the worst  And then you'll be a  Doctor with like a sawzall  Just cutting my jaw  No no  Listen  There's a lot of new type of treatments  Where they may not even have to do surgery on you  But it's the type of thing  That it needs to be evaluated  Stereotactic radio surgery  There is absolutely no way  We can say what that is  But what needs to be done  Is called a biopsy 
[02:01:30]  They'll just take a little tiny piece of the tissue  There's no sawzall  You're not going to lose your jaw  And then they send that off to the pathologist  That comes back and tells you  It's nothing  It's something  And then the treatment  What if it's sucked out?  That's well and good  That's well and good  What if it's something?  I need to know who I go to right now  That I got this big lump in my jaw  What type of doctor do I go to?  It's called ear, nose, and throat  E-N-T  Ear, nose, and throat  And that doctor  I have an ear, nose, and throat guy  That's who you have to go see  He's going to say  I don't know what the hell that is  No  Then he's not a good doctor 
[02:02:00]  He knows something  He'll take care of it  He'll, like you said, do a biopsy  He specializes in this type of thing  We're telling you  Ear, nose, and throat  Ear, nose, throat  Pete, you're going to get this looked at immediately  You're not diagnosing him as death  Okay  Yeah, tomorrow  Well, I got to work tomorrow  So Monday  Ear, nose, throat  Alright  That's who you need to go to  Alright  We're not going to properly  You know, we're not going to give you a specific diagnosis  Right, right  You need to go to a specialist  Someone who will be able to  Like the other physician said  Take a biopsy  Professional opinion  If you had to be, like, if you had to be quizzed on it 
[02:02:30]  What would you say that would be?  He can't  All I can say is I'm glad I  Not you  There are five things to come to mind with that  And, like I said, one of the things could be a malignancy  One thing  What would we write on it as a diagnostic code would be a mass in the mouth  We wouldn't write exactly what it was today  If it were an office  Because we don't know  What would you write on my death certificate?  How you miss a mass  Well, we would have a biopsy by then  We would have a biopsy  On Black Earl's chart, they wrote ass  So that's kind of close to mass  But, dude  We can't, we can't know 
[02:03:00]  You can't know without doing a biopsy  Dude, yeah, like they said  Go to a specialist  And, you know something?  This could be very good  You came down here on a whim  You check it out  Now people are telling you to check it out  Before you know it  I'm going to turn the lights off  I'm going to electrician  Before you know it  You're going to have it taken care of  And all of a sudden it's like  Wow, geez, a good thing you caught that in time  There you go  I was sitting there  I was bored  I called up  I was listening  All right  Well, good thing you did, my friend  Thanks for having this  All right  Thank you  Thank you, Pete  No problem  I think we have to say goodbye to the hot doctor, Allison 
[02:03:30]  Yes, Allison  Thank you so much for coming down  A lot of Sandy Cain's about to come  And, Rick, are you insane  After what we just went through  We need to take a break and regroup, it's called  Damn  Even we're smart enough to realize that  West Coast Dave said  You just made 12 million people stop smoking  Well, you want to know the truth?  Look at this one  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey  Let me tell you guys  I am so glad that you did this bit today  Why? 
[02:04:00]  I am going to stop smoking  Stop drinking  Get on the right diet  And God forbid, no offense  I never have to be on this cringe radio that you are doing today  All right  Thank you, Chris  All right  The hot doctor, Allison, has to get out of here  We're going to regroup, Anthony  It's a good one  Yeah  And we're going to wrap up this ridiculous bit with Sandy Cain  And we're going to finally find out what Twato is  And we will do that next  All right  It's very uncomfortable in here right now 
[02:04:30]  Uh, we'll be back  Are you bastards ready to rock?  Opie and Anthony  And you actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall  The Opie and Anthony show  Psychotic apes  Is this for shock factor?  Oh my God  1027 WNEW  New York  Opie and Anthony  1027  WNEW  How is she not a ride? 
[02:05:00]  Is she insane?  Will she know  One more life and all the rest of the day?  Is she not a ride?  Is she insane?  Will she know  One more life and all the rest of the day?  How is she not a ride?  Is she insane?  Will she know  One more life and all the rest of the day?  Is she not a ride?  Is she insane?  Will she know  One more life and all the rest of the day? 
[02:05:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Oh my God  Well, this bit sounded like a great idea in the back office, but  We were all having fun  I am really freaked out  I feel like there's many things wrong with my body  Body now  I got the  People are quitting smoking all over the country  Now that we're syndicated  Good thing  And well they should  No joke, man  That last guy was the real deal  Something is going on with him 
[02:06:00]  And he needs to be checked out immediately  Hopefully he will get checked out  We had no official diagnosis  But the doctors were all pretty much shaking their heads  The hot doctor said  I'm not touching it  Wow  Alright, Glenn, what's going on?  Yeah, that was the freakiest radio I've heard in my entire life  My heart's still going a mile a minute  Yeah, it was very  I've never been more uncomfortable in my life  Seriously  To see the doctors' faces 
[02:06:30]  Turn from  Hey, we're all having fun  And making cute little doctor jokes  Oh my God  We were hoping we wouldn't see one of these today  That was great  And I quit smoking a year ago today  Or tomorrow, actually  I realized that after that happened  And I'm just like  I'll never go back  Yeah  Norton, you're going to smoke or what?  Nah, man, this is it  Norton, you're done  I'm telling you  He pulled one cigarette out of his pack of cigarettes  Threw the rest of the pack away  And he goes  That's it  I'm just having this one 
[02:07:00]  I'm done  But it's like when you quit  You've got to just throw them  How long have you been  People quit on New Year's Day  They make a goal for themselves  And I know guys that have done it  I don't believe it  I've been saying I'm done  How long have you been smoking?  About 15 years  And that's what  And you saw  I've been wanting to quit for a long time  But you just saw what was going on in the studio  And that was it  I don't know what's wrong with that guy  But it's just like their faces  And I'm like  You know what  Enough  Enough  Enough  I quit drinking  I quit getting high  Enough  Done  That's it  No more  What about Stinky?  What?  He's young  Young smoker  I don't know 
[02:07:30]  Yeah  There he goes  I'm young  I'm young  No don't even look at  I don't even look at  Don't look at  Stinky  Don't look  Don't even look  You might see traces of mule juice  But nothing else  And what about you?  You do the smoking every once in a while  You go on stages  No I'm done  What are you kidding?  No you haven't in a long long time  I'm done  I throw them away  And that's it  Done  That's it  Oof  Do you take anything  Or do you just stop?  Just stop 
[02:08:00]  Throw the god damn pack away  And then when you go to light up  And you have the cigarette in your hand  And you go to put it in your mouth  You don't wake up out of a haze  And go  Oh my god  There's a cigarette burning in my mouth  It's a conscious decision that you make  Yeah  So guys  What do you think  Now that the guy's out of the studio  Seriously  This is just you know  Your opinions  I mean  You gotta be concerned  That the number one diagnosis  Is cancer  Cancer is the answer  Tumor is the rumor  So  Oh my god  I don't like that rhyme 
[02:08:30]  And it's in a bad place too right?  Yeah  The head and neck cancer  Is not a good one at all  It spreads very quickly  Ah  Some of the surgeries involved  In having to remove those sorts of things  Are not pretty  I'm gonna go see my mommy tonight  I need to suckle  Oh my god  I can't take this  You can just get that guy back  Oh my god  I can't take this  But you're coming in  Might have been the best thing  Because you might not have got that check  For another year  Instead of coming in today  And seeing your horrified faces  This will be the last time 
[02:09:00]  We do this  Because that's all  I don't know if we can handle this one  Yeah right  This might be the only time we do this  Why don't we get back to some fun anomalies  On some of these  I'm more hearing rumors about Twaddle though  And that's not gonna be fun either  Oh boy  Just hearing rumors Anthony  They were showing me pictures  Let's just put it that way  Great  Great  You want to bring in Sandy K?  Why don't we do that?  Why don't we get  Because we told people we were gonna do it  Before 6  Yeah  We gotta keep our promise for once  Okay  And anything else would be anticlimactic 
[02:09:30]  At this point  Look like  Hey no  I don't wanna  And stupid us  Hold on  Hold on Sandy  I'm gonna turn her mic off  Because that's the easiest way  Stupid us  I just quickly want to bring that guy in  As filler as they call in the radio biz  That could have been a lifesaver right there  But instead he was the showstopper  We could do what we want  She's talking to her dildo  I'm sorry  But he gets very offended  Alright  Because he loves you  He loves you  He loves Opie and Anthony 
[02:10:00]  And you know  He's so nervous to come on  And then you said turn him off  Sandy  Sorry  Sorry Andy  Do you know who these are  I've been waiting for this all my life  They're throwing tongue depressors at her  The doctors  They do listen to our show  They've got a great bedside manner  They're just throwing stuff at Sandy  They should have brought some needles  Out of that little metal box  The biohazard box  I'm glad I brought you dildo  Sandy  It's my protection  Do you know who these gentlemen are  Some of these people in the studio  Once we're in a coat

[02:17:00]  Reacts  With the  Warty tissue  Can she use  Balsamic  And maybe  100%  Maybe a little tasty  These guys have no doubt  Anthony  Is that contagious  I think  Is it contagious  Is it contagious  You think you were born with that  No  And the play isn't either  Because that'd be a show event  Yeah  You got it  Many years ago  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  Sandy  Isn't there one  Isn't there one  How do you say this  Oh  Closer to  Another area 
[02:17:30]  Yes  Even closer  There's something going on  I don't even know how to say this  If you open a door  Right right  Okay  Let's say  Let's say  Let's say  You have  Something on the outside  Of the door  In your house  Right  You go to your house  There's something there  That maybe you need  A carpenter to come and remove  It's a growth on the wood  Right  Outside the house  Is it true Sandy  That if this was your house  That if you opened the door  And walked in  There'd be something in the hallway  Also growing  On the wall  She's looking 
[02:18:00]  Like a fish out of  God damn water  You're the only one  That didn't get  So what do you do  With that  A brilliant analogy  Shotgun with a  Teletatchman  How do you get rid  Of something like that  I give that recommendation  When  When it gets that big  It's got to come off  Surgically  When they're smaller  You can treat them  There's a drug  Called condilox  That you can treat it with  That size  It's got to be  Surgically removed  And then you may even  Need the medicine  And it may require  But  That definitely  Has to be treated  Surgically  The bigger problem 
[02:18:30]  With it is  That you're saying  You had it for so long  Is that there's  Certain serotypes of that  It's the number one  Cause of cervical cancer  So you've got to go  No kidding around  We need to go get that  Checked out  When was your last  PAP smear?  About  Before I was born  I don't think I ever had one  Let's tell you  It was so long ago  The guy's name was  PAP  That did it  It was actually  PAP that did it  After himself  Mr. PAP  No kidding around  You've got to go get  A PAP smear  Can I tell a story  Years ago  I went to Bellevue Hospital 
[02:19:00]  This female doctor  This was like 15 years ago  And she said  Something about that  And that  Oh this is terrible  And blah blah blah blah  About cancer  And then  It was 15 years ago  And then they killed  This particular doctor  So I just  No they killed  They murdered her  At Bellevue Hospital  So she couldn't have been right  Later  So I'm still living with this  So she couldn't have been right  She's dead  And you're still alive  How does that figure?  That's exactly what I'm doing  Oh my  So what do you think guys? 
[02:19:30]  Do you think I should have  It be moved?  Well you know  We've got to cancel  We've got to cancel  The next segment of the show  Because  Turkish was going to come in  And suck on  Right  He was going to  Like try to  Actually kiss it  Or something  But no  Anthony  Highly not recommended  A lot of reporters  Including Bill O'Reilly  Ask us where our line is  We found it today  Here it is  We will not have a guy  Suck on Twato today  What Sandy?  Okay  My experience  And I've lived a long time  As you guys 
[02:20:00]  Obviously  Make fun of  Yeah  With doctors  And dentists  As you see  And I even went for my math  And they want to just  Totally really destroy it  Whatever I  Destroy it  Yeah  Totally  You know  Totally destroy it  And I don't  I don't believe in doctors  And I'm just going to  You don't believe in them  Like the Easter bunny  Sandy  So what you're saying  Let me get this straight  You're saying  You are not getting that  Taken care of  No  Just get it taken off  You horse's ass  Go to a doctor  Why don't you get it cut off  Are you Sandy?

[02:21:00]  Of anyone  Being affected  By this  Without having  Any type of sex  With her  Oh no  It's not spread  Through the air  Or anything  But if you're  Touching that  Wait  If she's  Fondling it  Like she just was  And then theoretically  Touches that door handle  And someone touches  The door handle  No  We're safe  No  Thank God  Alright look  I don't care  I want this whole place  Decontaminated  Please  Where's the Lysol  Get the Lysol  We should say  That this is
