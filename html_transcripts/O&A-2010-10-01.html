<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The October 1st, 2010, broadcast of the Opie and Anthony Show began with a furious discussion about their recently signed, underwhelming contract with SiriusXM.  Opie and Anthony vehemently expressed their displeasure, detailing the stressful and unfair negotiation process, highlighting the disparity between their deal and those of other, supposedly less deserving, on-air personalities.  They used highly profane language to describe their feelings of being undervalued and manipulated.  Studio guest Patrice O'Neal was present for this segment, and the conversation also touched upon O'Neal's upcoming Comedy Central special.  Other topics included their subpar studio space, the challenges of managing their social media presence (particularly the constant barrage of offensive tweets necessitating frequent blocking), and a discussion about music plagiarism, focusing on Led Zeppelin and Elvis Presley's alleged borrowing of other artists' work.

The show then transitioned into "Jocktober," a segment dedicated to reviewing other radio shows. This section focused on a scathing critique of Lamont and Tinelli from 107.7 The Bone in San Francisco.  Opie, Anthony, Sam Roberts, and Patrice O’Neal (who later left due to exhaustion) dissected various segments from Lamont and Tinelli’s show, including their poorly received "Lick Me Wall" segment and their obviously fake prank calls.  The hosts relentlessly mocked Lamont and Tinelli's perceived laziness, overuse of pre-written bits ("prep burger" bits), and awkward on-air chemistry.  They also highlighted the presence of Sully, referred to as their "black sidekick," who mostly just laughed at their material. The segment was riddled with offensive language, including racial slurs and sexually explicit jokes, and featured numerous caller interactions, many of which participated in a running gag of only giving their last names.  The critique incorporated references to current pop culture, like Lady Gaga's infamous meat dress.

Next, the show shifted to a segment featuring Stevie, a young, legally blind studio guest known for his excessive fast-food consumption.  Opie, Anthony, and Patrice relentlessly teased Stevie about his diet, blindness, and virginity.  The conversation quickly devolved into discussions about AIDS, cancer, and speculation about the potential suppression of cures for profit.  The already crude conversation was amplified by a call from Jim Jefferies, who shared graphic anecdotes about his risky sexual behavior and post-show routine.  Other brief mentions included a video of Patrice's performance, a Jägermeister contest, and the band Primus, as well as a previous incident involving Jason Ellis, a shock collar, and a bamboo stick.

The final segment tackled the eradication of smallpox, the economics of cancer treatment, and various alternative medicine claims.  A caller, "Dr. Steve," participated in a debate on the difference between "eradicated" and "cured" in the context of smallpox, leading to humorous (and sometimes offensive) speculation about the handling of remaining smallpox vials.  Dr. Steve also addressed the conspiracy theory surrounding suppressed cancer cures, largely refuting it.  The discussion then moved to the efficacy of various vitamins and holistic treatments, with Dr. Steve generally dismissing many as lacking scientific evidence.  A caller shared an anecdote about vitamin C curing a sore throat during oral sex, prompting further crude jokes.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Dr. Steve's dietary habits and past cocaine use, followed by the hosts’ viewing and commentary of a website displaying "before and after" photos of women's appearances in marriage, and a sudden, unexplained end to the show, despite having Mick Foley scheduled as a guest.

[00:01:30]  it's been a while it's been a while it seems like it seems like it seems like you know after you  develop a relationship it seems like a while but it probably wasn't it's probably like it's probably  two weeks it was over a month ago was it we took two weeks for vacation at the end of the summer  we've been back a few weeks oh it's been at least a month that's right and uh it's uh officially  jocktober which we like to call jocktober are we having jocktober uh yeah yeah 
[00:02:00]  because uh every year you know the radio stations do rocktober uh and they play uh rock  i guess it's a lot different than what they do the other 11 months which is play rock  some reason rocktober is just fun for the jocks to say but we do it a little differently we take  um we feature various disc jockeys from around the country that are being ridiculous hacky jocks 
[00:02:30]  and feature them on jocktober yeah that's what uh people want to hear right now they want to know  about our contracts jesus we'll get into the jocktober thing in a second what the fuck i'll just tell  them it's also jocktober yeah we were with or without us i'll speak for myself i was just held up to sign  a contract so absolutely i was fucking held up and uh signed a very mediocre deal and uh here we go  we're back for another two years i'm not gonna fucking sugarcoat it at all no sugarcoating no 
[00:03:00]  guys waiting as soon as i signed they ran away like fucking rats to wherever they go with the  contract into the i'm looking at your face he's really i'm beyond pissed oh my god i'm beyond pissed  they beat the shit they beat the shit out of us and they got all their points we got nothing and  and now uh you know they they think uh they got the best of us i guess so so you know you didn't  sign it at this point what would oh they threatened all sorts of shit i i needed it i needed one more 
[00:03:30]  day just to kind of think things over there was all sorts of rumors on twitter yesterday i didn't  sign shit until this morning at 5 30 5 40 actually yeah i signed like yesterday late late last night  i signed that's because people are confused look i'm gonna ask questions if you don't answer them  it's fine i'll answer every fucking question you want man what was the um did you have any leverage  at all no because this is the only game in town but the the fact of the matter is we we helped to 
[00:04:00]  make this the only game in town and then we wrecked regular radio and then they use it against you  handedly then they use it against you they knew there was nowhere else we could go so they they beat  the shit out of us so you know i don't know uh how they sit around their big offices and think that's  that's going to be fine in the end we had nowhere to go we we helped take down regular radio and then  in the end they they knew there was nowhere to go so we signed a mediocre deal you know now would you  say it was uh in a percentage how how much less mediocre was it uh than the original well the the 
[00:04:30]  original deal was mediocre this is mediocre so you this is mediocre it's about the same  even though for the last two years we built up a hell of a radio show for the company so  you know but the logically they think this makes sense i'm really frustrated you know i'll work  through it now did they make it and i'll be my happy self by monday no problem now what did maybe  within an hour it wasn't a good business move on their end i mean let's not talk humanity here let's 
[00:05:00]  talk they got did they do what they supposed to do as a big company they got an amazing deal  they got an amazing deal today you know when i signed and they ran away what do you think that  means holy shit holy shit holy shit call you know call the fucking media have you ever had a have  you ever had a deal based a little bit on loyalty ever you would like to see that you know but no  no it was always based on some type of fear yeah that that you know we were going to go somewhere 
[00:05:30]  else and fuck them up yeah and or uh you know i was on the i was on the phone with our agent at 11  11 30 and i'm like look you know i need to just breathe and like if you breathe i don't even know  what that means they could just take the whole deal off the table you got to get in there and sign  this thing oh yeah agent gave you jesus nothing worse than a god damn and i go you're trying to tell  me they're not even gonna allow me to just fucking breathe and maybe come in a little later not allow  fucking you but you just like dude can you be a can you be just a piece of shit like that we all 
[00:06:00]  think agents off like a day just be a fucking asshole for a second let me let me fucking sit  and hold my wife for a minute and cry right they didn't get the car and cry no i mean i i don't  want woe is me you know we're making a really good living and we're doing we have great jobs but it's  just how it all came together that's really frustrating you know people i mean the contract  wasn't done until really late last night and i'm have to read people on twitter going stop at the 
[00:06:30]  carny shit stop at the bit you know and read that so much man and said and said uh you guys signed i  didn't sign shit until 5 40 this morning and why did you he signed late last night i just got like  you know all kinds of fucking scanning equipment and shit because it was emails and then how to be  flat scan like uh a flatbed scanned and then signed and then and then converted back to fucking email 
[00:07:00]  and emailed back again so i was just in my office fucking flicking papers around because i was able  to you know just do it last night see that see the holdup was because we started this a month or two  ago we we felt as a show not just uh me but as a show and felt this way as well that the last two  years we built up a hell of a fucking radio show for this company and to have a deal where it doesn't  show any any any thanks for that is really frustrating you know but that's what my question 
[00:07:30]  was earlier was they supposed to do that like we were at a low number to begin with so we're still at  the low number even though the last two years we really proved to everybody how powerful this show  was and and and you know we brought in a lot of fucking people you know and i know now if they  re-sign the big guy down the hall it's going to be for another ridiculous number which is going to  just bring the frustration out even more that's where i'm at you know that's where i'm at but you 
[00:08:00]  wasn't ready to to uh there's an old saying i'd rather take none than less well well i mean in the  end you know in the end what are we going to do you know we had right there's only two there's  only two i got i got it's only two i got all the jump on a podcast but really how you know and then  the guy is like financially viable is that then the guy looks at me a couple days ago he's like i you  know just sign this deal you know i'll make you really happy i'm like but you have your chance to  make me really happy right now on paper and i had a bunch of points that were really important to me 
[00:08:30]  we all had you know when you work with somebody i have points that are important to me anthony has  points that are important to him and then we have points as a show that are important right and i i  said to him look this all these are all these points are really important to me so do a couple  of these things and you got a really happy and happy employee oh you know what they heard when you  said that oh yeah i just want happiness i just want to feel love but then turn around and say 
[00:09:00]  you know i'm you know we're going to make you really happy here it's like well you had the  chance during the negotiations but you beat the shit out of us you know i'm not going to get into  too many details but trust me there was some there was some weird shit going on with this negotiation  just weird well i want to i mean not to but i you know i'm supposed to do a special with  comedy central a stand-up special and uh they asked me what's important one thing that was important  to me i said i want to do it in washington they go no why and then they go the whole thing pick 
[00:09:30]  your battles i go you know you people like to use that shitty pick your battles analogy but you die  in any battle that you like when you're fighting you each battle is the end of your life so it's like  the one that meant the most to me because that's where the that's where they love me the most yeah yeah  that's where my fans are and everybody that loves me the most can get there right but they the thing  that was important but no no let that go just i gotta say this shit fucking guy goes he's on the 
[00:10:00]  phone he goes he goes uh how about music i go how about rockbox oh we can't afford that i go so why  did you ask so he goes well uh do you have a favorite composer so i was quiet for about 30 seconds i go  yeah john williams fucking business dude like like do you understand to artists the only thing  that means it's it's happiness but the money part you know what's out there that's what it's like  when you talk to squares like that work a nine to five and then it's like there you talk to show 
[00:10:30]  business what are you guys complaining about i make a baby i don't want to give a fuck what you make  man listen i know what money's in this business if i saw a check for two million dollars i swear to god  i go thank you and put in the but it's because i know it exists it's just how do you fucking oh  there it is yeah thank you see patrice you made a great point with the whole let it go and i think  a lot of people out there can relate to that like to you that was really important to do your stand  up in washington where you know you have so much love it'll make it so much easier right to do your 
[00:11:00]  thing right believe it or not this the stuff that i wanted where they're like oh just let that go  had nothing to do with money had nothing to do with money in the end i wanted more money absolutely  anything that you could talk about like anything that meant something to you that you can't talk  about you go i didn't get it i'll i'll say it not today though not fair enough i'll say it but not  today because i don't want people to think it was about money i want to be paid what i think i'm worth  and the show's worth and and we fell well short of that okay but we're gonna still make a really 
[00:11:30]  good living so you know woe is me no of course not but you know when you know the guy down the  hall is going to be offered a ridiculous amount of money to stay here not even close to us and we  know we're in the same league but see that's the fucked up he might be the mvp of the league but  we're in that league but they had to compare us to all these other like kind of mediocre shows  around here that's the thing the companies can use market value against you yeah but you can't use  market value against that like this is not the business at least in sports it's beautiful if i'm 
[00:12:00]  scoring 20 yeah and that nigga scoring 21 and he makes 10 million and i make two i go i want at  least nine because he because i'm as good as him and he's getting that right but you can't do that  in this game they don't i can't compare my money to some douche that i know stinks and go hey somebody  pay me accordingly too right it's like you got to get paid what what's good for you because you know  what's out there so when people can complain it's like look this business is there's no at least like 
[00:12:30]  when you go to a job unless they fire you you know i'm getting up and going to my job well this shit  is no this ain't no job this is an adventure as they say you take a leap and all you want is what  you think you're worth right but there's no one to say you know what fuck you i'm walking to who  to who because really you walk on this company you you really just you got your skill that you  could sell and in but you can't where you gonna walk it's only it's a buyer's market you know back 
[00:13:00]  in the day i guess 20 years ago as a seller you know you motherfuckers could go anywhere  everywhere yeah that's well that's the whole deal it's gotten so uh consolidated that you know they  kind of took that out of the mix just stinks yeah but this is but it's also this is like a big  corporation now it's not just me and aunt there's a shitload of people that depend on our  you know on us for their livelihood so you have to fact i'm serious i know i you gotta factor all  that shit in too yeah you gotta you know those people those people motherfuckers be like you 
[00:13:30]  should be just like keep that plaster that smile you should be happy to make that much i go 10  10 was in two and five was in another 10 was in oh shit 20 i forgot irs i don't know i'll be  able to get a pair of sneakers but they don't they don't understand the basic shit that makes  people like us happy you know like if you would have been able to just do your your your you know 
[00:14:00]  your um comedy central thing in washington the rest of the shit would have been on you would have  been on your tippy toes happy as all hell you would have yeah you would you know what i mean and  they don't get that and now they're sitting in their hall in their offices like ah we got them and  you know i know they're like that because if they are literally they are ah we got of course they  are literally literally of course they are literally literally or they would have just or they would  have just gave us a bunch of those points in the end it wouldn't matter to them at all but they want 
[00:14:30]  to save money here and there and and be able to go to their bosses and look what i did i saved this  much money on uh opian anthony i saved this much money over here but uh you know and that's their  job though yeah great that's what i'm saying as have you ever gotten you might have got the money  like the money can buy all the things that they won't give you loyalty wise if they give you enough  money like you go look i don't want to do uh this but if you pay me this i'll i'll just do it because  that's that's good money enough that's when it was xm they gave us uh some things we wanted we 
[00:15:00]  wanted that studio enlarged they made us really happy at xm with with with uh a lot of extra things  yeah okay they threw us in a in a crappy tiny little studio that i brought up during negotiations  and the guy actually said you have you have uh the biggest studio here besides howard and i'm like  this studio is the same size as this whole row of studios maybe technically it's a foot fucking  bigger he's trying to fuck it had to they had to fucking square footage i don't know 
[00:15:30]  it's not the biggest one more when you walk in yeah to the left is the fucking biggest am i crazy  because i looked at the guy i didn't even know what to say to him the one with the six pianos in it  yeah he was trying to pull some jedi mind shit on you but you'll have the biggest studio i didn't  even know what do you say to that he goes you know you have the biggest studio besides howard and i'm  like i can't even i can't even look at you right now i'm gonna tell you what this dude said to me 
[00:16:00]  hold on hold on if you they're amazing when they want to keep money man but if you if you did a  quick circle of this area okay yeah there are studios that are smaller but they're more like  for music jocks that just need a little fucking hole in the wall to just do their thing but as far  as shows that are trying to do shit around here they're all located in this area and if you if you  took a quick loop would you see about five or six studios the exact same size as this  or am i crazy different you're not crazy but thank you that's all i need some are longer this 
[00:16:30]  one is this one is square it's it's it's like what's the fucking thing you put the uh in the  holes and they pop up perfection it's it's like summer triangle summer fucking rectangle but they're  not you go you can be in there it's the same fucking shit it's the same shit like like a shade  shady right across the fucking way over there pretty decent size that's about the same size  different shape but but when my motherfuckers want when the motherfuckers want to do something  to scramble like you're talking about scramble your mind years ago i this was i never forgot it 
[00:17:00]  was so amazing when i first started comedy a guy didn't show up for the show and so i had did double  time and i said the guy came and i said to the guy look at the you know i did to the owner you know i  did the guy didn't show up i had to do more more time and he goes look i want some more money yeah  of course he goes i wouldn't pay you less money for less time and that i to this day i still don't 
[00:17:30]  know what he did like i go i mind well i want more money for more time he wouldn't pay me less for  less and i'm i'm like i don't understand but i wasn't doing less i i didn't even know what to  say to this day if somebody said it to me i'd be like what the fuck did you just say to me yeah  totally mind fuck just talking about what they do to you like and you just don't you just so what  can't why can't you be good to me and then and then you can't even argue the point because you  you think you're crazy or he's crazy like my point was i need i need a bigger studio so we can do 
[00:18:00]  some real radio when we try to set up shit in here it's it's we're bumping into each other  and when we moved over here from that amazing studio they built look there's pictures of it  state-of-the-art studio where we can move in an audience we had plenty of room to do things  they had to cut a notch in in here in my console so i could walk to my seat every day because everyone  would kick the back of my chair everybody that walked by i'm just getting kicked i'm surprised 
[00:18:30]  they couldn't for you no kidding and patrice when we first uh you know moved over here they said this  is a temporary thing we'll try to get you into some bigger space and through negotiations we couldn't  even get that done i you know this i'm lucky they just said no to the studio like nope nope they said  no to just about everything there's one there's that one right near the door there that's huge that's  what that's the fishbowl that's for uh every you know performers and stuff so i understand that's  off limits i do understand that but you can knock some walls down and make our space twice as big 
[00:19:00]  very easily half these shows are a waste of time that looks like a load-bearing wall that looks  load-bearing i don't think they could uh i wanted this wall just taken out that's load-bearing i wanted  this wall to be taken out just to give us some some breathing room where you know what i mean  just some space keep you over there that would have been the the shit but they wanted it was an  amazing place they needed us over here so they could go have us have us here you know what i mean  so they could walk down the hall and and and we weren't trying to hold them up for 
[00:19:30]  a massive raise by the way we wanted just a little something that said you guys really did great for  us the last two years this is why i don't have a career by the way because i'm sitting there going  i'm sitting there i'm really in your heads now meaning just and i'm going do i my next one do you  have enough money to just just fucking sit in tahiti like i'm just like what the like i'm sitting  they're going it's just it's hard to work when it's not fun it's it's frustrating i mean because 
[00:20:00]  it's it's like it's such a great gig it really is a great gig and and all that and and i i really  enjoy it but these guys just just beat you fucking down and then the guy tells you you know we're  gonna make you really happy around here i'm like what does that mean you had a chance during  negotiations now you got now you got a guy that's a bit bitter uh through the whole negotiation  process i'm a bitter fucking guy right now and a grown man and i've been there a grown man where  you just want to give other grown men the silent treatment like a child you just don't want to talk 
[00:20:30]  to him like please don't ever talk to me i don't talk to you why are you talking to me yeah there's  there was no handshakes this morning and there won't be any handshakes don't even don't even attempt  that shit i don't i don't front and play that way i'll give you a nice solid handshake when i feel  like it's a solid deal for everybody you don't think he he'll come in later i'm not shaking  hey how you doing no he knows he got us he he's a smart business guy you know he is where  he is because you know he knows this very well you know but then in the end what do you get you 
[00:21:00]  get guys that are a little frustrated a little bitter right so how does that help the company  in the end trust me by monday you won't even know the difference i'll fucking laugh at everything  but it does it just but today should be a good day and there's a there's a bitter taste in my mouth  especially last night at 11 o'clock when i usually go to bed around 9 9 30 and they're like  bob's panicking i'm like bob maybe we shouldn't work tomorrow so what you know we could sit down look  at this contract he goes oh no you got to sign at 5 40 in the morning at that point i don't know what 
[00:21:30]  would happen i'm like really they're they're willing to just fucking take the entire deal off  the table if i don't run in there at 5 40 and sign this thing and sure enough as soon as i got here  there was three guys in suits just waiting with fucking contracts in their hand and a pen  three guys in suits and 5 40 right it's like that's really how how things are done and they  got out of bed at two happy as a motherfucker oh and trust me it wasn't important enough for the  main guy to be here i did notice that wow it's his beauty sleep holy shit man but i know on lower 
[00:22:00]  levels is how it is just they don't give a fuck man all you had to do was give me some change  just a little change you understand a quarter would have kept me just a quarter just give me  a quarter right but they think they were doing the right thing because their initial offer was  so fucking low i said look i don't need to work anymore so if that's where we're at that that was  the hold up i'm like i'm done i don't want to be done but i'm not working for that number sorry  so finally they got up to the mediocre status where we were at so we continue at mediocre 
[00:22:30]  knowing the big guy will get but you don't get a mediocre show though like they don't get they get  a they get an amazing show and and you know what i've learned over the years to to not bitch as much  by later on this morning i'll move the fuck on but at least i get the chance to see what i need to say  today not me it's either that or a fucking nervous breakdown i am super childish i don't i don't want  to talk once they once they you know it's just like they make you sick and you just go it's it's a 
[00:23:00]  human level but it's the thing is you're dealing on a human level a human emotion is useless in  this game so if you have any like like the idea of loyalty or idea of hey man i'm good to you or  you you you talk well about you i don't care i lost i lost any faith in that loyalty thing like  fucking years ago yeah it's just there's no you can't have faith in that i finally got to that  point finally i probably should have learned that lesson years ago i really should have not in his  business so that's that and that's well good to have you guys uh i was praying i was on board 
[00:23:30]  here i'm serious it's such a shitty day in new york too i'm like this is perfect of course  of course this is happening on a shitty day seven out there more more than shitty by the way  i saw noah on the way to this motherfucker yeah people stuck with hazards and i'm just crazy  it is bad outside the traffic lights were sideways on the way in yeah 40 mile an hour winds puddles 
[00:24:00]  that uh are engulfing cars out there i'm like of course this is the day uh i got to continue with  this company of course i'll tell you not a nice beautiful early fall morning with the sun slowly  coming up ah yes no all hell breaking loose out there i'm like of course it was supposed to  happen bright future looking at a bright future sunrise coming up and you're like ah yeah no it's  fucking it is it's like a fucking mayan is sitting on the side of the corner fishing like i told you 
[00:24:30]  motherfuckers it's the end of the world that you should have signed a one-year deal because it's over  by the way a couple more things that we'll move on the show now is officially uh it goes from six  to ten a.m they're they were holding us to uh something that whatever that that's more involved  too but they held us to something they probably shouldn't uh shouldn't have for about a year and a  half but now the show is back to where it's supposed to be a four-hour fucking radio show  and um any time after that they better be prepared to open up a fucking checkbook 
[00:25:00]  i have become a la carte my friend the whole world the whole world is a la carte when you fly  what do you get window seat pay a little extra right you want to fucking you want your luggage  on the plane a little extra well me i have become a la carte including meetings no meeting no meetings  for me at all unless you want to do between six and ten and then they have to because afterwards 
[00:25:30]  they would have to like write a check right it's like right oh you know what you need i've become  a la carte they want me to do shit on other channels around here that ain't happening you need a taxi  meter belt that's right you could just hit it and it's like a taxi right just starts chalking up money  and you go okay again don't answer can you really hold them to that what can you do that i just i really  want to know what do you mean can you go no you pay me for anything past 10 there's nothing in my 
[00:26:00]  contract that says i have to do meetings i'm done no meetings for me i'm being dead serious no meetings  i'm not meeting with anybody if you want to do the quick meeting i'll give you this if you have  something to say between 10 o'clock and the time it gets to the elevator i'll give you that  i'm not even joking and the walk i'm not even joking it's gotta be a question like like a defendant  walking into a courtroom right they gotta blurt questions out like the press are you guilty are  you guilty see did you kill your wife and in mid shake too like that right see i shake four times 
[00:26:30]  see when you beat up your uh employees that are doing really well for your company during  negotiations this is what comes out the other side of it and they need to understand that they  really do need to understand that oh god okay you know i want to do some hockey talk and some  other ship on channels around here no fucking way will i do anything for any other channels no way  that could be a little separate negotiation i guess 
[00:27:00]  why so flat today why was today the  fucking day and because our contract ended yesterday but they were the one that you know  started negotiating really fucking late there was there was a much better deal on the table but  then they said that deal wasn't on the table and it was a just a mess  yes are you proud of you is your agent one of them now or he's still one he's still on you you  still like him so what's going on with you patrice  shit shitty shit balls oh boy oh boy whenever anyone goes oh boy 
[00:27:30]  hey patrice they want you to play just a big fat man  i live that life hey man if you don't i go to bob i go to bob you can't even tell them that i i  can't sign a contract at 5 30 in the morning are you serious you feel like you don't even have that  much power to tell these fucking guys that i need to breathe now after all this shit because it was 
[00:28:00]  really extremely stressful as well i love i love a manager an agent in my lifetime that say  fuck that you're not i i i follow anybody that says no yeah even if it's bad my guy goes no  fuck that i'm like yeah nigga that's right that's fucking right i'm getting fucked in the ass baby  we're getting fucked in the ass that's right you need more 10 percent than that shit nigga  when your guy's like oh come on man take it just take come on here i got great grease look 
[00:28:30]  at my asshole does it look that bad that's that's all i do is taking an ass why don't you come on  follow along uh so so i had you know we rushed in here to uh well aunt said he signed late last  night and i uh signed this morning it almost feels like your guy you know it's like we're having a  an agent and not saying yours is just in general if you don't have a good it's like having a the 
[00:29:00]  the difference between having uh a defense attorney and a public defender like it's the difference  between you got money and a guy's like hey you know what we're gonna fucking did you think you go  i'm not guilty and he goes you know what we're gonna fight this all the way to the end as opposed to  i'm not guilty and they're offering you a great deal i think you ought to take that deal i think you  ought to go to jail for two years hey man look you got fucking 20 hanging over your head but i'm 
[00:29:30]  fucking not guilty yeah no just take the deal you know what it was i gotta just say something  i'm not killing bob you know but i'm just saying you know he he's done right by us over the years  i'm just really really frustrated at just everything that went on the last uh month or so when you know  i don't i don't know if bob made a great deal i don't know i'll have to think about that it'll take  a while i i don't know when he was going viacom versus fucking clear channel right i mean we were just  sitting there and going like wow all right go to town what's the what's what's the new deal today 
[00:30:00]  and back into the other one back into that court let's see what they come up with but you know  uh when you walk into here and with the way things are and fucking there's there's no one's hiring  anybody and wait a minute is there no other games radio games in town no we fucking took it down  there's yeah regular radio is all about all the guys that were doing great on regular radio are 
[00:30:30]  now on satellite radio this is the place to be from a creative standpoint okay but if you really want  to make really good money you got to have some make-believe fucking deal to play against these guys  that's why howard's fucking brilliant in negotiations threatens to leave every fucking time has a viable  place where he could go and so what they do is they open up the fucking checkbook for the guy  is that v8 patrice is poo-pooing my v8 jesus christ i love that 
[00:31:00]  i'd rather you eat real vegetables it gives me my daily  commercial part you drink that  right i just don't like the tomato part yeah i fuck with the thing what is that something farms  that they have the green machine you know you know the green naked naked naked uh oh that stuff  naked yeah i just don't like tomatoes in my shit no it's not too tomatoey i mean i don't mind it  enjoy your ga man keep you alive i'm trying to stay alive too

[00:32:30]  asshole in his basement now i love it block gone problem fucking solved i don't i don't buy you  don't get i don't get much i got one recently when i said i was trying to inquire about billy squire i  didn't all right yeah and who they equate billy squire to in like the rap community and it was who was  it it was fucking like some guy went bananas and i go i go this is not necessary and but i like the 
[00:33:00]  i like people now they know they'll get blocked so at least yeah get a good one in if you're going  to get blocked the thing is i got like 40 some odd thousand people following so like to block five  people in one sitting there's really nothing but you don't know the you don't know the game every  person you're blocked they just they just start another account oh i know so they're following  you anyway but fine but they fucking stop doing what they now is sitting in the back and they're

[00:35:30]  quote-unquote celebrities like for real shaq has three million followers i could go shaq what's the  deal with the celtics like to him and it's possible he could go oh man i'm playing with it but it's a  privilege right to talk to this motherfucker like i said i've said it before if you wanted to get in  touch with lucio ball nigger it was a hell of a thing you had to do man paper pen find out where 
[00:36:00]  to send it with her agency you would go to the agency lucy would never see it it would be almost  impossible yeah these motherfuckers don't understand that how far down they'll go if like celebrities  were like what are you like block block block don't you can't get in touch with me yeah unless  you a fan yep and i don't mean you have to suck my dick because i got a lot of funny assholes but  they know how to be in that in that realm i fucking i heard something last night that was hysterical 
[00:36:30]  it's what derrick is doing our our buddy derrick he is emailing steve jobs every day it like like  they're pals like he writes things like hey steve um you want me to read you one yeah read me one  read me like because this is twitter no he's he's fucking emailing him he cc's and then he also if  like is steve jobs writing back yet not yet not yet not yet and also if sam like leaves his email  open right and he's writing an email uh d-boy will put steve jobs on the bottom so steve jobs has 
[00:37:00]  been cc'd on some of our just show related derrick's bit is just blind ccing steve jobs on  anything on everything you think he sees it i don't know but that's just it it's like the absence is  there with him i think it's like the luck of the draw like if he's checking his email at that time  yeah read one of his here's yesterday hey stevie just wanted to check in and see how things were  going today i was wondering if you had a whole closet filled with black turtlenecks and new balance 
[00:37:30]  sneakers that would be awesome if you did it would be just like arnold character in the last action  hero that's how i think of you a total badass kicking the butts of the competition and even  better bill gates could be just like the ripper from the movie and that evil guy with the one eye  can be those pricks from google you're awesome take care derrick b you know and he's just every day  steve jobs has access to one of those harps yeah as he fucking microwaves this 
[00:38:00]  fucking douchebags brain i was saying he's gonna fuck you up he's the head of technology  this fucking asshole and he's got to deal with derrick fucking dopey d-boy he's in charge of the  end of the world or or emailing every day some kind of friendly little message absolutely  well let us know let us know if uh steve jobs writes him back i would love to know  definitely let me go to tony in jersey tony what's going on tony hey guys listen 
[00:38:30]  i just wanted to give you a consumer point of view on what's going on because i completely  understand agree with what's what you're feeling right now and the fact that i pay a lot of money  for a subscription and with that subscription i expect quality content and if you guys aren't  happy that affects the concept that affects what i'm paying for and i can tell you that you know you  call him the big guy but from a consumer point when howard went over the quality went down we're lucky  if we get two full days of radio and on top of my regular subscription i have to pay extra if i 
[00:39:00]  want to listen to him and it's very frustrating well i think i've already beat up the company enough  so i'll just shut up there's a there's a listener's point of view yeah exactly thank you tony i  appreciate it we do try to keep it honest on this show they get mad at that but i don't know whatever  look i'll be a true professional this show will fucking continue to rock simple as that  you know we have a responsibility to ourselves and our listeners yeah but you know the frustration that 
[00:39:30]  we felt um you know yesterday continues today and they they could have done they could have done the  right thing for weeks they could have fucking had really happy solid employees but they chose not to  again and they'll say they did the right thing by keeping us at the same number that's that's  ridiculous because we were damaged goods when we went to satellite radio our number was way too low to  begin with way too fucking low no one wanted to touch us that's why we took a beating after the sex for 
[00:40:00]  sam thing still the great living all that but as far as what we were we were worth we were worth  shit at that point so we're not even close to what we should be making as long as the ant can keep  this pool functioning that's all i care about keep my security cameras up a couple of more keeping a  couple more trees blocking views there you go hey i got my accountant working well he's working  we uh we got a busy show patrice o'neal today uh we got jim jeffries coming back i put the shock

[00:41:00]  so you picked out a remote so you could be shocking yourself and i got the highlights uh you know on  this video i made last night so but then at the end of the game because he really wanted everyone  to play legit where you turn it all the way up that they were playing at five so at the end jason  ellis showed you what 10 looks like and i mean this guy fucking hit the floor like a sack of  fucking he twisted around like his body contorted and he fell on the floor it's like god damn i'm  watching an electrocution and i wanted to step up yesterday and in the end i'm like i can't  fucking do that no i put it on my dog the one when i bought it from yeah yeah put it on him i had it 
[00:41:30]  on something like four five or four yeah and not even enough for him for it to affect him in a bad  way just enough for him to have gone like look down and look up and go oh my what would just happen  you know just just that little doggy what just happened face yeah didn't even i could i took it  right off i was like you know just shit where you want man i can't i can't i can't do it i can't  fucking shock my dog's neck poor little fucker little bastard didn't even know it hit him his

[01:01:30]  that's the whole thing we did she looks like every actress who was like a really hot teenager who's  battling cancer later in life so turn up this turntacular radio it's jocktober on the opie and anthony  show before we start though there's a there's a really good phone call coming in joe in jersey joe hey joe  hey yeah man i fucking had sex with this chick one time that had uh scoliosis yeah just straighten 
[01:02:00]  her out yeah i tried but that shit was terrible it looked like one of those fucking ribbon dancer  ribbons that was just frozen a ribbon dancer ribbon frozen in time really that bad it was terrible man  and i didn't know at first like she walked she had good posture and stuff i couldn't see if she had a  shirt on but i was i was getting a doggy style doesn't it it was fucking crooked as a question  mark and it makes one shoulder drop down a little bit right a little bit because one time she sat on  my lap and i just thought she was funny because she was sitting on my lap but i had a hand on her back 
[01:02:30]  and it it felt like a like a like a frozen pillow or something like it was just crooked holy shit wow  that's bad because uh danny just punched up some pictures here uh there are some people that are just  completely fucking it's an s yeah that's fine is a fucking s that's gonna be a nightmare they can't  straighten that shit out i think they can with like back braces and stuff but my scoliosis is a  slight curvature so it's not slight it's slight i'm i'm happy for you slight slight of frame you're 
[01:03:00]  slight of frame that's true slight scoliosis yes all right sam you're responsible for jocktober  don't disappoint i wouldn't disappoint and i i feel like you've put for the challenge you said in the  first segment of today's show that all the good radio shows are coming to satellite radio  and so it's my job to find some good radio shows that are on terrestrial uh-huh very good and you  have yes that's right so who do we look at today for jocktober well i wanted to start with a familiar  show that we've talked about a couple times in the past uh we talked about him not too long ago 
[01:03:30]  by the way patrice if if it's a show that you do yes you can sit back and not say anything you don't  have to say as long as they don't hear your voice during this trash you're about to get i don't  think so do you know who we're doing today who sam well from 107.7 the bone in san francisco  it's lamont and tinelli ah there they are yes oh my god the originators of ta-ta tuesdays 
[01:04:00]  which is a good promotion did they do ta-ta tuesdays they do ta-ta tuesdays  motherfucker they kind of look like fucking bizarro you guys every every radio duo does  you will never see a fucking picture me and aunt where one of us puts our hand on the other  other guy's shoulder like they're doing well that's tom that's tom arnold tom arnold and uh  that's uh and that's a douche no that's tinelli

[01:05:30]  with uh lamont and tinelli and there this is well the first clip is there uh that this is what they  start the show with every day okay you can read on the track list what the segment's called uh it's  called lick me wall it's the lick me wall what that's right it's where uh callers call in to just  talk about whatever they want oh god lick me wall who's this what does lick me wall mean i'm not quite 
[01:06:00]  sure lick me wall who's this what is that based on i'm not a hundred percent positive about what it  actually means they don't uh explain it anywhere but basically it's just like you know you're putting  it up on the wall it's whatever anybody wants to talk about kind of get your feelings out maybe  hopefully fingers crossed get a nice little joke out there hey you know i'm sure lick me wall who's  this confucius confucius how are you confucius uh very well getting to be a daily occurrence with 
[01:06:30]  uh well you know what when you've got when you have when you have the philosophy of confucius  i mean it's just brimming over you got to share with somebody what's going on confucius what what  advice what wisdom do you have for us today a dumb man climbs tree to get cherry a white man  spreads limp well there you go thank you maybe you pick uh fruit for a living that's good to know 
[01:07:00]  always go for the low-hanging fruit it's a little bit easier to pick  what happened well they made a uh they get knocked off the air or something  no it's a sexual innuendo oh you get it spread no i really didn't well it was awful oh patrice are you  just annoyed and the uh voice is fantastic we love the uh radio voice again another show with  the radio voice guy you heard them laughing after it so i guess it had to be funny right 
[01:07:30]  and sully was laughing sully is their little uh black sidekick what that's right they got sticks working  on that show  all right and you didn't like that i thought this is kind of an edgy show i don't know what i just  heard well it's what does what does lick me wall mean oh you're still stuck on that at least  explain what that means it's when you call up the show it makes it a lot easier for the listeners to  play along at home if they know what know what it means look at them all touching each other 
[01:08:00]  lamont tanelli with sully there's too much the black guy and they're all leaning and touching the black  guy looks like he's getting beat up by the two looks like a fucking hate crime and the black guy  let's be honest looks oh he looks a little the black guy looks a little funny too yeah  yeah motherfuckers ask me why i don't smile in pictures right if i'm ever with it that's what  it'll look like if i'm with a white guy smiling in a fucking picture man yeah he just looks like  he looks like yes uh yes uh 
[01:08:30]  they're just bossing him around just tickling at their little pet nigger  in person i'm fucking disgusted that's why i'm so mad all the time this is what we look like when  we're happy yeah you got to be angry you got to put on angry face what does the black do for the  show sam he just uh he's laughing he's okay guys but what does he do he's psychic that's all he does  his laugh yeah he doesn't he just throws some lines in every so often and on the website he 
[01:09:00]  throws up some of his favorite jokes okay that's cool people are saying lick me wall sounds like  ichiban which is a brilliant bit by uh ronnie there yeah but ichiban itchiban means number  one what japan or something yeah japanese i don't know what it means but they've never had anything as  funny as the confucius confucius you know the philosopher well right who's mr mihoff mr mihoff  oh he's probably mr don't spoil it okay okay continue with jock tober and uh we look at lamont 
[01:09:30]  and tinelli oh boy you're on the air lamont tinelli show the bay area is up in form the link me wall  who's this you got mr mihoff here how you boys doing this morning doing great you know it's always a  treat for me to talk to uh mr mihoff uh he's been a regular caller to the show and i'm really embarrassed  that i i i'm just horrible names man you got a lousy memory what is your first name again  jack that's what i thought yes all right  get it jack me off patrice is reading the paper and i don't blame him i wouldn't either how long 
[01:10:00]  have they been doing radio these guys are great all right fantastic and they did a jack me off joke  jack me off you thought it was just a guy whose last name was mihoff it's mr mihoff and uh you know  we love you he calls a lot uh but i'm i'm bad with nick what's your first name bob well i should have  just ruined it bob was bob me what was there was there a time when we did silly fucking names and  did a little bit with it yeah yeah but it was probably a hole it was probably first name it 
[01:10:30]  was probably our first week of radio yeah they're still jack me off fucking jokes this late thing  career it's like you i'll kill you i'll kill you as radio show hosts you and anthony have evolved  to the pristine level that you're at now well shouldn't they have as well you would think  they've been out of 40 years no lamont cannell you're still kind of they went they started in a  position and then they just sat there for many years does mr hunt call in at all what would be mr 
[01:11:00]  hunt's name um i don't remember first names i but i oh oh mike  mike hunt get it oh you can't say that well you could say jack me off me off i'm i'm following an  fcc complaint i would too you're not allowed to do that anymore radio complete a double lack of  entertainment on the air complaint yep what does the black do during this he's just laughing he's  just having a great time was he in the middle of that laughing yeah just laughing at his white friends 
[01:11:30]  oh boss you done a good job with the jack me off joe lamont and tinelli as we continue with jack  tober uh promo featuring a poorly acted very fake prank phone call well it's a prank this is what i  love about jack tober we get to tear down all the fucking walls regular radio is not allowed to do  prank uh prank prank calls anymore so if you're listening to regular radio you hear a prank call  it's all fake what that is a major fcc that's a major fcc complaint yes major yep but i hear all 
[01:12:00]  these shows with these hilarious prank calls and they get the guy oh gotcha what they do is they  walk around the radio station yeah in most cases and they get a sales girl a sales guy the fucking  janitor or whatever and they work out these prank calls and make believe they're real you know i know  that's not the case with this because they call chucky cheese there's no chucky cheese at the radio  station oh okay you're right you're right then why did you write uh poorly acted sam i didn't write  that i don't know where you get i don't know where you're getting this from sam takes october 
[01:12:30]  very seriously he only calls the best of the best is it bad it's not good  i don't know where you're getting this from sam i don't know where you're getting this from  i'm ralph well hi ralph i'm special  well i'm sure you are um what can i do for you today will you cook my dinner for me 
[01:13:00]  of course of course my parents aren't around and i'm not allowed to turn on the stove  well that that makes sense that makes sense do you want to come to chuck e cheese  my parents won't let me use scissors well that's great do uh by the way another thing  holy as we tear down another wall yeah radio guys love doing this to to make something sound better 
[01:13:30]  than it is yeah yeah they pound they pound for the for the regular radio guy pounding happens all the  time yeah because like they can't control themselves because what's going on on their show is so good  they gotta just pound i can't believe this guy from chuck e cheese doesn't know it's a ralph  from the simpson's soundboard it's amazing because it's such an obscure reference it really is ralph  from ralph wiggum yeah ralph wiggum is calling chuck e cheese it's outrageous it is listen for the 
[01:14:00]  pound won't let me use scissors well that's great do uh did you want to order a pizza i could that  it would be dinner i'm wearing a bathrobe and i'm not even sick  he's just hung up that just makes no sense whatsoever  he's like what the hell  that's another simpsons clip of course it is it fits perfectly but that's like you know when you 
[01:14:30]  put a promo out there you kind of put the very best stuff of the show that's going to make a  listener say i gotta catch those guys in the morning but it doesn't make sense if the guy was enjoying  the whole thing and laughing along and then he just hangs up what how about having some continuity  with your fake bit no it's your fake bit you don't think it was a real prank the guy goes from enjoying  what's going on and then just hangs up maybe he had to go do something wow there are some holes i guess in 
[01:15:00]  the logic behind it that was incredibly bad what was the black guy doing during that he was probably  just laughing having a good time his white friends making prank phone calls oh god you guys  yeah patrice has left the studio  i wish i could i understand patrice patrice has nothing to do with his jocktober today 
[01:15:30]  let me in got five stars by the way what's let me in the little girl vampire movie yeah really  that's the chick from kick ass no girl from kick ass oh that's her her next movie yeah no it's  weird i was thinking the other day there's just not enough vampire movies out there yeah  or 3d movies i'm so glad they're making vampire movies because i was thinking you know we needed  a lot a couple more yeah we need vampire movies tv shows too uh lamon and tinelli featured uh on this 
[01:16:00]  fine jocktober first yeah first day it's a whole month lamon and tinelli bring up the lady gaga  meat dress story even though it's a week and a half old so they can play a bad bit oh no what are  you talking about here huh well you know sometimes conversations they sound a little forced uh-huh  because somebody has a bit that they want to play and they need to they need to squeeze it in  and lamont and tinelli uh lamont and tinelli like their bits yeah so for the rest of uh lamont 
[01:16:30]  and tinelli we'll be uh focusing on that aspect we've heard the prank phone calls we've heard the  lick me wall now what do they fill the rest of their mornings with bad bits song parodies yeah they  like their song parodies that they got from somewhere else or do they at least make their own some of them  are made is this from prep burger this one i am pretty sure is a prep burger but it sounds like a 
[01:17:00]  prep burger some of them so they don't have anything to do with this bad bit not this one  some of them not only is it a bad bit they have nothing to do with it like they found it and said  somebody else made this this is so good i'm going to play it and take credit for it but they  needed a way to get there so they bring up an old story even though it's a week and a half old  got it and i know we talked about this last week when you brought up the story about lady gaga  and that meat dress yeah the meat dress yep she was wearing it at the grammy awards so apparently  now uh this dress was such a fashion statement i guess it was the emmy awards yeah yeah neither 
[01:17:30]  this dress of uh meat that she wore there were different cuts of meat that covered up her body  but this was this gal is just a whack job isn't she but she had her money though there's a little  rump roast i don't know what kind of statement she was trying to make a little roast beef a little  filet a little skirt steak strange i didn't see any skirt steak listed here but i definitely saw  some some beef curtains different kind of meat wow wow they went with beef curtains that's beef  curtains that's edgy here's sully laughing in the background oh i know who's that crazy that's the 
[01:18:00]  black guy sully just laughing and they're talking black just laughing and his white bosses making  jokes jesus christ it's a shame i'm gonna start doing that i need a job nigga i'm doing it right  now starting the rest of the show i'm fucking i am you want to be you want to be token black i'm  token black guy jesus playing the part of token black today beef curtains different kind of meat 
[01:18:30]  so anyway this dress that she was wearing skirt steak is another man's beaker and it's just  semantics don't let it go um so this uh beef uh dress she was wearing was such a fashion statement  that now they're going to make her dress into beef jerky that's right serve it well they want to  preserve it it's not going to be eaten oh okay they're just going to preserve it the only way to  preserve it is to kind of turn it into jerky because i was going to say keep it the way it 
[01:19:00]  was hell if you uh went bad it went down and had that jerky just like something wrong with this  piece of meat where this meat come from and this is turned into like a big you know there's always  endorsement opportunities i mean you gotta hand it to her business manager because she was wearing  this meat dress now they're turning it into jerky she's a pr machine absolutely and now it's turned  into like an endorsement from the beef council if you're looking for a dress here comes a bit  and then they go right into a bit well there was nothing in the paper that day no so they had to go 
[01:19:30]  with an old story to get to their bit that someone else wrote for them took like a minute and a half  to build up of them saying ah this dress tastes funny wouldn't have more respect for the guys that  they said look you know we really like this bit we have no real reason to play it today that but we  think it's kind of funny so here you go well part of lamont like they're like weaving in and out  getting to that point part of lamont and tinelli's humor is that they never acknowledge that something  is like uh just a bit or it's a prank thing they go oh here's a commercial and then everyone starts 
[01:20:00]  listening oh it's a come oh that's not a commercial now come on guys but it is funny they got me again  you gotta give it to them it is funny you do huh absolutely and now it's turned into like an  endorsement for the beef council if you're looking for a dress everyone will go gaga over  try beef yep from a miniskirt steak to a sexy new york strip strapless stunner beef serves up 
[01:20:30]  something special so whether it's sizzling on the red carpet or sizzling on a red hot grill  beef makes it beautiful beef it's what she's wearing yeah there you go you can actually see those  commercials rump roast  what  i've had it 
[01:21:00]  token black you like that  he wanted to say rump roast so bad  he just said it he didn't even say it  he just blurted it out i guess he felt good about his meat curtain line so he had to get  the the rump roast line he probably thought of that while the bit was on like ah i didn't use it  huh sneak it in after the bit uh we got jimmy james who's going to explain the lick me wall  uh jj  good morning boys what's up jj  yeah the uh lick me wall it's kind of like if you ever heard this little thing called the fu line 
[01:21:30]  can we just cancel this guy's xm subscription  it is another it does sound a lot like the fu line oh what you're getting a little uh you just vent  is that what it is yeah but they're all fake callers it seems like well what does lick me wall  mean yeah why call it lick me wall because you guys have fu line and there's dirty words in that  oh so it's like it's like hey lick me lick me and here's the wall so it's like oh it's like 
[01:22:00]  you get to post up on the wall like graffiti almost it's your ideas on the wall but it's like  instead of fuck you it's hey lick me it's more like ah lick me yeah you don't like it  wouldn't a better bit be the punch wall don't they might because you got some anger you got  some shit you gotta fucking get out well yeah well lick me is pretty good lick me  lick me because you're going all right that's like you're telling someone lick me whoa ken in  pennsylvania ken hey how you doing the lick me wall i believe is for willie wonka

[01:24:00]  host the whole show for you matt something new man something new yeah it is new it's new we haven't  done it in a year we do it once a year i don't know talk about the news well you know what you  might have about the news you might have to take october off though sir yeah don't listen i wish i  you fuck you're blocked if there is any question is the popularity of jocktober all i did was tweet  an email address of where you can send suggestions in right wasn't even mentioned on the air yes one 
[01:24:30]  tweet dozens and dozens of uh say of requests wow you really made your point there sam dozens  and dozens of people but it's me tweeting it opi what is this a podcast if you tweeted it we're  talking hundreds of thousands it's just lowly sam roberts right i mean dozens and dozens of  interest though but when i get the dozens that's crazy tens of people tens of people i might have to  agree with matt i didn't know dozens and dozens dozens and dozens to this uh hundreds they bring up  the segue owner story that we talked about a week ago yes well why is this audio from yesterday this 
[01:25:00]  yesterday's show wow the segue story is already old very old it's a week old yeah so they bring up  the segue owner story that we talked about a week ago because they have a bad bit so that's their so  that's their thing yes they hear they got to get themselves to the bad bit right that's just playing  the bit like it's literally that segue story well this is kind of funny so we're gonna play it right  no they have to weave in and out and get to the bad bit the entire show is forced conversations 
[01:25:30]  that lead to bits yeah like they just forced conversations so they could play a bit it's  clever it's clever you gotta give it to him all right yeah this guy was 62 years old was riding  the segue around his estate yeah and uh went off a ledge and into a river that is incredible  here's the uh gyroscope wow who just added uh some great commentary right there sounds like 
[01:26:00]  that is incredible well i think everyone would think it's incredible of course  it's tough to make everything funny it really is and interesting even hey just rolled off the segways  what's the black guy doing just waiting for his bosses to make him laugh did he have to run and get  coffee for them right maybe did he have to go fetch some stuff in between laughing into a river 
[01:26:30]  that is incredible i guess the uh gyroscope wasn't working you think i think so yeah so do we uh i  believe we are going uh wait a minute oh my god you know what i love about patrice he was trying to  stay out but you can't help yourself this is this is uh you know when you're dealing like funny your  whole life and you just know different techniques on how to try to make things funny yeah that was 
[01:27:00]  technique number 4006 which was all right we have nothing i'm gonna pray that this sparks up something  some oh yeah yeah right the gyroscope and then he's like maybe that'll get everybody going  nothing yeah oh shit one of the guys went like yeah gyros yeah reminds me of uh greek food yes the gyro  maybe that's why he went off the cliff he had a little too much  oh every morning this is holy shit this river that is incredible 
[01:27:30]  i guess the uh gyroscope wasn't working you think i think so yeah so do we uh i believe  we are going uh it's kind of a touching ceremony they're having for this guy's a multi-millionaire i  know there's a uh a huge time difference between here and germany yeah where i think 
[01:28:00]  the funeral is scheduled for today and we uh we are going live i think they've got a musical  tribute to this man who owned the uh part of the only segway company part of the memorial here yeah  we're going live as we speak we have these oh why would you do that you know it's coming  they're going live they got a bit this is hokey i don't want to excite you guys but this bit did  they come up with this bit at least or is it another prep burger bit i'm not positive what a  fanning but i will say that this is a song parody i know you guys love the song parties 
[01:28:30]  you like song parodies oh fucking boy  oriel here yeah we're going live as we speak we have a satellite set up on the roof so  all right all right oh my goodness musical tribute we get it to the guy who died you know the segway  company segway to have popular funerals oh yeah  there's a rich guy who's dead found in a river bed and he's riding his segway

[01:29:30]  wow  and he's riding his segway to heaven  yes he's riding  what are they laughing at segway to heaven  oh there wasn't a dry ad in the house apparently not  they got a big time music budget i'll tell you that yeah  it's like everything's if they made it that might be a prep burger bit yeah a lot of these guys just 
[01:30:00]  fucking you know buy bits it's stairway to heaven is the original but the it was a two yeah they came  up with two almost clever lines almost almost shoehorned in and two very obvious lines i guess  yeah yeah we're almost clever two lines and then the song ends right it's two lines that would  substitute where clever lines would go in  moving moving uh through the first day of jocktober 
[01:30:30]  lamont and tinelli yeah lamont and tinelli out there in uh the bay area uh they talk about sarah  palin palin getting booed on dancing with the stars they have a bit yes they do they have a  bit wow so is that their format yeah this is one day one day this whole thing is one show these  fuckers are prep burgering their asses off yeah we need the help of the rest of the country are  you hearing these song parodies and these bad bits in your market other markets because it looks 
[01:31:00]  like they just prep burger man yeah  sounds like they're cheering sounds like they're cheering yeah  so why do the cheers turn to boos there that's what i can't figure out those are pretty good scores  yeah eight eight why would they be booing the judges exactly i don't know i don't know if that's  proof so they're saying it's it's there well you know what we have sarah palin here oh we do  reacting to this uh rumor that uh she was uh booed on america on america not america's gonna tell 
[01:31:30]  dancing with the stars dancing with the stars hey sarah sarah what  what are they doing what are they doing what are they doing it's uncomfortable i don't get this  well they're also really trying to get and they got those nice rock beds under them while they talk  they're trying so hard to get to the bit right that's what i mean you had that i lost that battle  i'm like we don't need fucking rock music behind us while we talk well technically you won the battle 
[01:32:00]  because you don't have it anymore well we had to fucking leave the station like they are still doing  it that way right they're still doing it that's so they've been in this business a long time that's  so they can say the rock stops twice an hour uh only stops twice an hour yeah so because when you're  talking and there's rock music behind you they consider that you're still rocking this is the  number one station for rock in san francisco uh terrific they told me uh sam i don't know if  this is good someone just punched their radio oh don't do that it's just lamont and tinelli 
[01:32:30]  if you don't like lamont and tinelli you could call their lick em wall or lick me wall or whatever  it is me wall yes i like the seamless transition from talking about sarah palin into the bed it's amazing  that's how you know the conversation to this uh rumor that uh she was uh booed on america on america  not america's gonna tell dancing with the stars dancing with the stars hey sarah sarah palin so uh  people are still talking about how you were booed on dancing with the stars the other night how do  you feel about that well i don't think that they were um yeah anyway i don't think they were booing me 
[01:33:00]  oh what are you doing i i'm sorry it's just something that naturally happens for some reason i can't  control the urge to boo everything you say uh maybe it's because subconsciously i know that  everything you say is ridiculous and your mere existence is making the political landscape in  the world as a whole a worse place but i just what i'm sorry i tend to boo the harsh truth  a whole bunch of boo is going on there  there boo yeah exactly at least you boo yourself that's good wow 
[01:33:30]  i am  wow  you know i realize about radio it's if you don't talk it makes you more tired  like so if you're sitting there listening to this horse shit right i'm like i'm like i'm  fucking losing my skull right now yeah you need a nap right we're almost done uh patrice no you

[02:13:00]  a uh a bit that that revolves around the number three now yeah see what i did there the montanelli  i'm doing a montanelli yeah sleep to a bit thank you stevie no stevie the reason he's out of breath  is you should hear what this kid eats for lunch on a daily basis oh man what what do you wait i want  to hear from stevie stevie what do you eat don't lie well um usually you know because i'm a long cast  so no i probably i just get you know mcdonald's or burger king yeah for lunch every day no poor man 
[02:13:30]  that's the only thing you can fuck that damn i'm just gonna believe that oh what do you get there  okay well like i don't know like what they should have like like the last burger king okay okay like  a salad or a wrap well i'm not really a salad or a wrap guy per se burger because burgers cost a  dollar yeah so he eats burgers big stupid burgers right yeah stupid well they got the two the two  long chicken sandwiches for four dollars i get those and um i get a whopper you get two of them wait  you get well because you get two for four yeah one is 329 or something like that wait this is one

[02:14:30]  i get you know like a chicken nugget or two like like of like the four the four pieces yeah like  i'll get like two of those if i have enough or one together all the shit how come some people your  heart goes out to and others you just you can kill us you don't care your heart's going out to this  kid i don't know what it is with this kid like this is we know he's truly sad because his father  never loved him yeah father is it maybe i see it father beat him up a little bit yeah it's something 
[02:15:00]  i i don't it's like this kid is like i like like bobo does nothing for me yeah bobo we could you  want to pound bobo over the head yeah and we want to we almost want to hug stevie almost so it's weird  bobo whatever stevie i want to tease him because he's so teasable but it's like well we got to do that  anyway we got a radio show to do but you know some people you go you go you think it's fit because you  know we take we pound each other all day so it's like this kid is legitimately a high school shooter

[02:22:00]  so  I need some more orange juice. 
[02:22:30]  I'm sorry, man.  Do you really need more orange juice?  I fucking...  Is that just putting you into a coma again?  This is getting me.  Should we switch it up?  Let's try something else.  It's very eclectic, Primus, and it's very acquired.  This is better than Billy Squire.  Look, and I'm not going to argue. 
[02:23:00]  I'm just saying this commercial for them is not...  That wasn't a good commercial.  They don't need a commercial from us.  They got their followers.  No, for me.  I mean, I'm trying to know.  I'm trying to understand.  You never heard that song before?  I've never...  Fucks no.  You know the South Park theme, right?  Yes!  That's Primus.  That's...  No, it's Primus.  Oh, it's everybody?  Primus.  My friend of mine.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Yeah.  That's Primus?  Well, fucking...  Yeah, but that doesn't...  That's not saying it to me, either. 
[02:23:30]  I wouldn't listen to the South Park song in my car.  Stevie just ran again.  Every time you say orange juice, this kid is running to the kitchen.  You got trusty squeeze.  When does it go from helping your diabetes to making your diabetes worse?  I can't...  I'm not going to drink these two.  I just was fucking around because I needed that, though.  Well, throw me one, then.  Here you go, bro.  Thanks.  Hey, Jim Jeffries.  How are you, sir?  I'm good, thank you.  How was Caroline's last night?  It was great.  Yeah, it was great.  Nice job.  Yeah.  Good crowd?  Yeah.  No drinking?  No drinking.  No drinking.  I remember you at Caroline's, man. 
[02:24:00]  You knew how to fucking drink after, before, during.  No, I walked...  It's very boring, though.  After the gig, I finish, and just...  People invite me out somewhere, and I'm like, no, I've got to go back.  Go be boring.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, right.  I'm masturbating a lot in the hotel, like a stupid amount.  You're never going to make it.  Yeah, yeah.  You're never going to make it.  But, yeah, it's...  Because you are always good for fucking getting toasted, hammered after a show.  Every show, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what?  You can go back to your roots, I'm thinking. 
[02:24:30]  Do a little opera.  Yeah, yeah, that's going to happen.  Get the opera thing back.  I'm going to start skateboarding, so...  Were you a skateboarder, too?  No, I just want to get good at something to piss off Jason Ellis.  Oh.  No, I don't know.  I thought you guys are...  No, I'm only joking.  I'm only joking.  I am...  No, look, I am enjoying the waking up in the morning and not wanting to kill myself.  So, you know, it swings in roundabouts, isn't it?  I guess that's good.  Yeah.  It's probably a good thing.  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right.  Caroline's all weekend long. 
[02:25:00]  Jim Jeffries.  212-757-4100.  Just see the show and don't hang out with them afterwards.  By the way, I want to thank Jim Jeffries personally for stepping up yesterday, because me and Ant  certainly didn't.  No, neither of you did.  With the Jason Ellis bed, with the shock collar.  What was he doing bringing in shock collars for, anyway?  It's shocking.  But then it was like, when he goes, if you don't have the shock collar, then I get to  hit you with a bamboo stick.  And you're like, I don't remember any of these things.  How about the choice of none?  Yeah, none. 
[02:25:30]  Like, I want a choice of none of these things.  But he's, you know, but there's also the thing when I meet a big guy like that, where  I worry if I say no to him, that he might beat the shit out of me.  And what I've got to tell myself is, you go, hang on, that's against the law.  He can't do that.  Yeah.  He can't just start beating the shit out of you.  Like, if he did that, he'd be arrested, like, every day.  So, he'd just go, when he says, can I hit you with a bamboo stick, you go, no, no.  And then he can't.  Then he can't.  Yeah.  It's a wonderful fucking system.  It's called the law, yeah. 
[02:26:00]  It works pretty well.  I think I could have taken a hit with the stick, but we weren't supposed to hit anybody.  And the funny thing is, in the video, there's a bit, you see Danny's screen where it says,  don't hit anyone, as Stevie's hitting Ellis with the fucking stick at the end of the video.  I knew that wouldn't get us.  No, but you're allowed to hit Jason.  Yeah, of course.  Because it's his stick.  It's his stick.  You should be able to be hit in this world with any of your own possessions.  Yeah, yeah, especially if you don't care.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  That looks like Huntington.  It's like that whole thing when if you're with a chick who likes it a bit rough in bed, 
[02:26:30]  so you have, like, a safety word because she wants to keep going, rape me.  Right, right, yeah, yeah.  When she says, no, you're meant to keep going, so she might have a safety word like peach or something.  Yeah, yeah, that way.  That makes you stop.  But the problem with the safety word thing is, if you choke her and she passes out, the safety word is null and void.  Like, it just goes out the window.  You know, I've had that where I'm choking her and going and fucking her and her eyes will roll back in your head and you go, oh, I'll ease off on this one.  Really?  Yeah, I had this girlfriend who I never hit, but one time I was laying in bed, and her mother always had me, and I swear to this, I had a nightmare like I was fighting with someone, 
[02:27:00]  and I punched her in the face, in my sleep, bang, punched her in the face, woke up to, she woke me up and she had a black eye,  and I'm like, people are going to believe this, right?  Yeah, yeah.  People are going to think that I just punched her regularly, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So her mum didn't believe it, but we told her the story, and she sort of said that she believed it, but she didn't believe it.  Now, this girl also liked when, when you're fucking her, she liked you to choke her around the neck. 
[02:27:30]  That's so fucked up.  Now, one time I choked her so hard, she had a thumb mark and all these fingerprints down the side of her thing, right?  Now, the punch I could, I could play off as I was having a nightmare and I punched the girl, but then when the mum saw the bruise marks around the neck, you can't go, I tell you what, your daughter likes it like a slut.  She likes it really hard and really horrible.  And loves being choked.  And that's explaining that one.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never done it to her in anger.  You can't, I don't get the choking. 
[02:28:00]  I quite like it now.  There's weird things, because I didn't like it until I did it to her, and then it becomes a thing for you.  Like, it's like, I once fucked a chick, and then halfway through, she asked me to call her daddy, right?  And I stopped, because I didn't want that to become a thing.  Wait, wait, she wanted to call you daddy?  No, no, she wanted me to call her daddy.  Oh, no, no, she started calling me daddy.  Oh, okay, yeah, because that's what you said at first.  It's like, why would she...  No, she started calling me daddy, and I went, no, shut up.  Don't, don't do that.  Yeah.  Because you only ever hear that in, like, comedy type of situations, you call me daddy or something like that. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, that's fucking stupid.  But that's a girl who's been molested, right?  I would assume that's...  Who are always the best fucks?  Any kind of baggage is usually good for sex.  Any kind of childhood trauma, sexual abuse, abandonment.  Oh, the amount of uncles I should thank.  Yeah, so it's any kind of bad, something bad in the childhood usually makes for good. 
[02:29:00]  But it makes the girls crazy, too.  So they have a very short shelf life.  Yes.  Yeah, because they're fucking...  You can't go out with them.  ...bat shit crazy, as I like to call them.  You can't have them as girlfriends.  Yeah, I don't think I've really met more than two or three girls in my entire life that  weren't completely fucking bat shit crazy.  No.  Like, completely crazy.  I've met a few who have held it in for months. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Exactly.  Like a magic act.  Like a magic act?  Yeah, they can hold it in for a while, and then they just fuck it.  It comes out, and you're like...  And they start coming apart at the seams.  You're like, what the fuck?  How did I do this?  They can't hold it back anymore.  In the same way I've held in my racism for years.  No, no, like, you know how, like, sometimes you...  Like, I'm an abusive guy in a car.  Like, I'll start swearing at everyone.  But on the first five dates I don't, I'm letting people in ahead of me.  Oh, right, yeah.  You don't want to do that the first day in the car. 
[02:30:00]  No.  When you first pick a girl up, and you're driving like, motherfucker, go!  You fucking asshole, you made me miss the light!  And also, the way I talk to my parents, in reality, is something that I hide from women  for years.  Really?  Until they sort of get to know me.  Where I'm like, shut up, you fat bitch, go!  Still to this day, if I'm staying over there, my mum won't get out, you'll hear me yell,  get out of my room!  How old are you?  I'm 33 years old!  Get out of my room!  Get out of my room!  And my dad's actually suffering from Alzheimer's now. 
[02:30:30]  Like, he just got it.  He's.  And the thing is, I think I...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, sorry.  Is he suffering, or is the family suffering?  No, he just got it.  Oh, okay.  He's only got the onset of it.  Right.  But he could have had it for years, he was always a bit forgetful.  Right.  And this has just been a slow burner.  Okay.  But the thing is, physically fit as fuck, right?  Gunter, really fat and unmobile.  Gunter.  Which is your mother.  Yeah, but sharp as a tack in the head. 
[02:31:00]  Really smart, right?  So together, they're like the ultimate person.  They're similar to, like, Master Blaster from...  From Mad Max 3.  Yeah.  But they, yeah, she just orders him around, he lifts things up,  forgets what he's holding, and sort of carries it in.  Shit.  They can't exist without each other, but they hate each other.  It's a wonderful sitcom waiting to happen.  Wow, that is, it's got to be a little stressful when you go visit.  My parents have never liked each other.  But they're such, um, assholes in general play that they can't make new friends. 
[02:31:30]  So they have to sit with each other.  Well, why didn't they just get divorced?  Because I think they're waiting for us to die.  I'm not sure.  They've never liked each other.  Never even liked each other.  As far back as you can remember, they never got along?  I've got to have been the last time they fucked.  I've got to have been.  That's fucking 30-some-odd years ago.  I'll tell everybody, they went to Hong Kong.  No one put this on the internet, because they will get in trouble.  They went to Hong Kong, and my mum, because my brother was working out there, 
[02:32:00]  and my mum was staying in the hotel.  My dad just wandered around at night.  And then my dad comes up to me, and obviously because he considers me to be his dirtbag son,  out of the three.  And he goes, uh, and he's trying to talk like it's normal.  He's like, uh, yeah, in Hong Kong, they, uh, they have these, they're just prostitutes  everywhere around the street.  Oh, man.  They're, they're all over the place.  And, uh, oh, they come up to him and talk to you.  I wonder, I wonder, there's probably a lot of guys there who, uh, who have sex with them. 
[02:32:30]  He's feeling it out.  And he's like this, he goes, I wonder, I wonder if you can get AIDS if you get a blowjob  without a condom.  How does that work?  I wonder, because I bet your people have done that.  Get a blowjob without a condom.  He's feeling it out.  And I'm there going, I'm not your best gauge.  Oh, but I'm pretty sure.  I was saying to Anthony over here before you came in.  I'm going to get my green card, but the next step is, so my, uh, my lawyer rings up  and goes, oh, it looks like you're going to be approved for the green card, right?  So I'm like, fucking ace.  I go, what's left?  He goes, you've got to go get a medical test.  And so if I've got any of the hepatitises or something, I'm not allowed to stay in the 
[02:33:00]  country.  So this might be the last time I'm on this radio show.  No, I don't know.  I've just never had the test.  I'm not looking forward to that.  That's got to be a dick day where you're not allowed in the country and you've got AIDS.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  It's a double fuck day.  That's it.  That's it.  Like, that's in Dubai.  If you go into Dubai as an immigrant, they test you for an AIDS test at the airport.  They don't just send you back on a plane.  They lock you up in a cell until it's time for you to leave and they'd run out of tests 
[02:33:30]  and all that type of stuff.  You've got AIDS going into Dubai because the Arabs are a tolerant bunch.  You've been to Dubai?  Have you been there?  Yeah, I've giggled there many times.  So you've had the AIDS test at the airport?  No, no, that's if you come in as an immigrant to work there constantly.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I had an AIDS test.  The last time I had an AIDS test was in South Africa.  Jesus.  I banged the bird in South Africa and my girlfriend was flying out.  So I started to panic.  Well, they must grade on a curve down there.  Did you just fucking rub her up? 
[02:34:00]  I did, but it snapped and there was blood and shit.  Oh, my God.  You fucking so have AIDS.  You so have AIDS.  This girl was so fucking skanky as well.  And I'm like, but any girl who would sleep with me, she's not going to be high grade, right?  So I'm there with fucking AIDS-y McNeil in bed just panicking and she's going,  I don't know what you're worried about, so I'm completely clean.  And so my girlfriend's coming out like a week later.  This is like four years ago. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, no, I've had an AIDS test since then.  But anyway, so I go out and I go to the clinic.  Because, you know, over here, you might take a week to go back for your results or two weeks.  I think they're fast now, but it used to be like two weeks.  Yeah.  But in South Africa, 10 minutes.  And I guess that 50% of the people they're walking back to has AIDS, you know?  So these people are fairly jaded.  Yeah, yeah.  And I go in there and I go, I've heard that it can lay dormant for a couple of months.  And the doctor was like, ah, that's sort of true.  It can do that, but it normally doesn't. 
[02:35:00]  He goes, put it this way.  He goes, when someone's raped, we check them that day.  Right?  So I thought, all right, well, that's a positive sort of thing we're talking about here, right?  Oh, wow.  So anyway, so I go and get the test.  And the doctor goes off with the bloody blood and does what he has to do.  And in that 10 minutes interim, they give you someone who has AIDS to chat to you.  And they sit there going, going, going, ah, it's not that bad.  You know what I mean? 
[02:35:30]  Like, why do they do that?  They're trying to cheer you up because they're assuming you're going to have AIDS.  Because there's so many people that have it.  Yeah.  So they've got this person going, ah, it's all right.  It's all right.  And I'm like, I'm panicking and she goes to give me a hug.  And I said, nah, just don't.  Right?  I said, but in 10 minutes, we might have sex.  Because then she becomes a viable option, doesn't she?  You're like, I don't like you now. 
[02:36:00]  I'm sorry you have AIDS.  And then it's like, yeah, okay, now we can fuck.  What I think about AIDS at the moment, because I'm carrying a bit of extra weight,  there's going to be about, if I have it in like five years time,  I'm going to be like, you know, I could do with that amount of weight loss,  not the drastic weight loss.  Yeah.  There must be a middle section of AIDS where you're feeling pretty good about yourself.  Where you kind of drop off the weight, but you're not emaciated.  Where you've got cheekbones and you've got fucking abs.  And you're like, don't fucking look at AIDS fit.  It's like that.  It's like that.  I said this on stage last night, but I was just talking and passing. 
[02:36:30]  I was like, watch that Barbara Walters documentary  where it was about a girl who ages 10 years every year.  Oh, the progeria kid.  The progeria kid, and they talk to that little girl.  Yeah, yeah, they've got that voice right there.  You feel horrible for her.  But there's got to be somewhere in that theory  that that girl would have been a hot two-year-old.  Like when she was in her early 20s.  That would have been, yeah, because they're not like,  yeah, what are they, age like? 
[02:37:00]  10 years a year.  So by the time they're 10, they're fucking.  They're 100.  100, and they're pretty much dead.  They're done.  I always think about kids like that when they go,  so do you enjoy school?  What's your favorite subject?  That's going to be like, I love English.  And you're just like, take her out of school.  Yeah, that's what we were saying.  Just take her to Disneyland every day.  Get her a fucking season pass.  I'm really good at math, but English isn't my strong subject, 
[02:37:30]  but I'm learning as a good one.  So you're good at math, though.  I bet you know you're 10 times table.  That's the saddest disease on planet Earth.  Oh, it's terrible.  You're 10 times.  I laugh at Jerry's kids.  Those Pajaria kids.  Pajaria kids.  There's only like 10 of them in the whole world.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just sad to watch them just...  It's like a fuck disease, man.  There's a lot of diseases like that that they're so...  Luke Holtz looks like he has Pajaria. 
[02:38:00]  He talks like it, too, that motherfucker.  Put him out of his motherfucking misery.  But it's one of those diseases that there's so few people have it.  Could you be ass curing it?  It's like, it seems like a lot of...  You know what I mean?  Like, why bother, right?  If it's like one in every billion kids or million kids or something stupid like that...  That's stupid.  I'd say that's a better chance than cancer.  Fuck cancer.  I'm done with it.  It's had its time.  It's had its time.  I was in...  Yeah, but we've got to have some people...  Oh, you're saying charity work for cancer.  What was this...  This thing... 
[02:38:30]  It took over every channel, cancer, recently.  Every channel.  Well, it does...  Even A&E.  It does spread quickly.  I mean, it just fucking...  It just did something.  Really?  Yeah, everybody.  Big fundraiser.  What kind of cancer was it?  All.  They went all.  Because too many stars got it.  You know, like Michael...  Michael fucking...  What's his name got it and all that shit.  Michael Douglas.  Fucking...  They took it over.  And I'm just sitting there going, it's never...  And then doing more reading, there's never been a cure for anything.  When Michael Douglas got cancer, the only thing that went through my brain is that 
[02:39:00]  Catherine Zeta-Jones will be single again.  Oh, fuck.  That's good news.  I've always liked her a bit.  She's a little long in the tooth.  They've had vaccines.  They have vaccines.  But never, ever cured anything.  Never a cure for anything?  Never.  Ever.  Wait, is it something that just fixes something?  No.  How do you think of that?  Nothing.  No, they've never...  Yeah, they didn't cure cancer.  They got a vaccine.  But no, there's a...  No, for polio.  They got a vaccine.  Polio and stuff is a vaccine.  There's a vaccine, but they didn't get rid of it.  They've got a hepatitis vaccine now for certain hepatitis. 
[02:39:30]  Once you get something, that's it.  They might be able to make a cancer vaccine, but I think we know.  But then there's no way...  So cancer is one of those things we got to live with for the rest of our life, because  you could get cancer at a fucking left nostril, nigga.  So it's like...  They might be able to get a vaccine for like one form of cancer.  But not for all of it.  Cancer is the big daddy, but I put AIDS above it now.  Really?  Oh, absolutely.  Do you think AIDS is more prevalent than cancer?  Absolutely, because you can...  If you got cancer, you can at least fuck in your last years. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, no.  Most people go impotent with it.  If you got AIDS, you know, I don't want to talk about your dick getting weak.  I'm talking about the fact that somebody will or will not fuck you.  So if you go, look, I got AIDS, and I'm going, or you going.  Yeah, you're not fucking.  But if I got cancer, you know, you go, all right, you know, I'll give you some pussy,  or I'll fuck you.  You know, you'll fuck a girl, miss you.  Yeah, but you can fuck other AIDS people.  Yeah, but who wants to do that?  Guys.  I don't even think fucking people with AIDS want to fuck other people with AIDS. 
[02:40:30]  It's almost, it's just like, yeah, you got AIDS.  Fucking guy got AIDS.  And isn't it true?  Like, can't you get like a worse type of AIDS from somebody?  Fucking, like an indignant AIDS, because you think, God is amazing.  Like, you would have lasted fucking 20 years with your AIDS, but the person you've just  fucked gave you the AIDS that kills you in like five fucking years.  The super AIDS.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:41:00]  Super AIDS.  Like that, I think that can happen.  So you probably don't want to fuck even if you have AIDS.  Because I could, you could give me the Magic Johnson AIDS right now and I'd be happy as  Larry.  Yeah.  That's an easy one, right?  Larry.  He looks healthier than me.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't think he's got AIDS.  He hasn't got real AIDS.  I don't think he's got AIDS.  They said he doesn't even test positive.  Yeah, I think he never had fucking AIDS, to tell you the truth.  Or HIV.  He'd have to, he got, I think it was false test results.  He got it in like 1990, was when I heard about it.  He got it when everyone fucking was dropping dead right after they had the diagnosis. 
[02:41:30]  Like, they didn't know what to give fucking people.  20 years ago, he'd be, fuck that.  He's had AIDS for 20 years, man.  He never had it.  There was a bum fucking test.  That's what I say.  And it made him a better businessman.  No, because they, you can be, you can test positive.  You need, like, they need to test your butt four times.  You can't have one positive, like, just by accident.  I heard that out as well.  Fucking between your tests.  I don't have it.  I've told you my theory yesterday.  Yeah, what, you can't get it?  That if I fuck enough sluts, one of them has to call me out of respect. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, right, yeah.  Just eventually.  So, yeah, yeah.  She would call saying, you gave me AIDS.  Yeah.  Because I've had girls tell me that I've given them other things,  and then they've gone off and tested themselves,  and it turned out they didn't have anything.  Like, you ever had that, like, spot on your cock  from where, like, ingrown hair has gone off,  and then you're gone?  Because I think every time I look at my cock,  I'm like, oh, is that a herpy?  What is that?  What's that?  You know what I mean?  It's just like I've grazed it or something. 
[02:42:30]  I'm like, oh, that's fucking, now I'm fucked.  And every time it's fine.  You know, there's no problem.  So you think you're clean?  I know, I know.  I've been tested recently, actually.  Yeah.  So I'm pretty, yeah, I think I am.  But I do go through some panicky times.  Panicky?  The thing is, I was with a friend in South Africa  when I got that test,  and the doctor said I was 98.9% positive  that I didn't have AIDS,  even with the two-month period afterwards.  Oh, you don't want to hear 98, though.  You want to hear 100 and fucking 10.  Yeah, why not 100? 
[02:43:00]  And my friend said that,  and then he goes, you got 1.2% AIDS.  That was how supportive he was.  What an asshole.  I don't know, man.  Fucking in Africa is crazy.  Oh, yeah, it's running the gauntlet.  I saw it in fucking a porn.  This Japanese girl, real porn, too.  Japanese girl, tourist, went to Africa  and just fucked natives raw.  Holy shit.  And let them come in a pussy.  Wow.  It was shocking.  I showed it to my girl. 
[02:43:30]  She was in fucking panic mode.  Holy mackerel.  Sitting on straight,  and it wasn't even,  it was undeveloped.  She must have.  It was like fucking the King Kong natives,  nigga.  She must have already had AIDS  before she went in there.  She wouldn't have gone in.  But Japanese porn, if you watch it, man,  they're just sinister.  It's all about degradation.  No, it's all about rape and tying up.  It always starts off with a guy  hiding in the bushes.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no, no.  That's that we lost the war mentality. 
[02:44:00]  That they have.  But it kills you how unfriendly they are.  Shit videos and.  Like when I see them in the streets,  I just go,  I've seen your porn.  I know what you're all about.  Stuck up cunts.  You fucking.  I've seen a fucking,  where they put a meat hat on them  and a fucking Hila monster comes in.  Meat hat.  Chases them around and shit.  It's like,  they love being,  but this one was,  wow, that's shocking.  Dude, it was,  you know,  I don't even remember what to,  how to find it. 
[02:44:30]  Cause,  you know.  But it's such a long flight.  I agree.  I think she had to have AIDS.  And she was just,  she just thought they had it.  All of them had it.  And so.  I mean,  how much money do you make  for filming a porn like that?  But it wasn't a money porn.  It was a goddamn,  she was on a safari  and she just fucked natives  and let them come in.  Just,  you know.  By the way,  they did cure the black plague,  right?  They didn't cure it.  It just stopped.  No,  it just stopped.  And they don't.  It just stopped.  And I think their black plague became, 
[02:45:00]  bubonic plague was recent.  Yeah.  They just,  they killed,  you know,  it's like Ebola.  Ebola's not cured.  It's just somewhere,  you know,  monkey just chilling.  Scurvy,  a mate of mine got scurvy  for the first time  in Australian history  in over a hundred years.  A friend of yours?  A comic called Chris Franklin,  like he's quite a popular comic  in Australia,  got scurvy.  How did he get scurvy?  He just didn't eat any  fucking diary.  He didn't eat any vitamin C  whatsoever.  Just lived off beer  and cheeseburgers 
[02:45:30]  and got fucking scurvy.  That's an old pirate fucking disease.  And what does that mean  when you get the scurvy?  Your fucking gums go all  to shit  and your teeth  start falling out.  It's what the sailors  used to get  because they were just  eating dried meat  and bread and stuff.  You look like a fucking,  yeah, pirate.  And that's why  the British are called  limeys  because they suck  the limes out of the thing  to stop from getting  the scurvy.  Limey.  That's a fucking insult.  It's like,  yeah,  you look at you  and your clean teeth.  Pieces of shit. 
[02:46:00]  God forbid you're limey.  You know what's fucking  interesting about Ebola?  I saw a special  about Ebola.  It's better to have Ebola  around than AIDS  because AIDS is like,  the thing about AIDS  is that motherfuckers  look wonderful with it.  Oh, yeah, Ebola.  Ebola, you die.  It's so fast.  It's so fast.  It can't spread too far  because it's so fast.  Yeah.  So all you got to do  is wait.  Take a bitch  on a long date.  Bleed through the eyeballs.  She starts bleeding 
[02:46:30]  through the eyeballs.  She's bleeding through  the ears, bitch.  I knew it.  Stay away.  I can't get that Ebola  on a plane.  No, it's like Ebola.  They're dying before  they get to the fucking airport.  But Ebola,  you don't get through fucking,  is it?  It's airborne, isn't it?  Or you don't get through fucking?  I don't remember.  That shit is scary.  That disease was...  Ebola will get you airborne,  yeah.  That was a scary one, though.  You're going to get it.  When we learned about Ebola  for the first time,  it was scary.  Dude, outbreak when Ebola  was the thing.  But then they finally had to admit 
[02:47:00]  that that's a tough scenario.  It doesn't spread too quickly.  Yeah, and you notice  it's not around.  No, because it was  the disease of the time.  But I'm saying  it's not around,  but fucking cancer  and AIDS is still around.  But Ebola's gone.  Let me go to Ray  in Winnipeg.  Ray!  It's there.  Can't make no money.  What's up, Ray?  Hey, smallpox  is the only disease  that's been eradicated.  People were vaccinated  until the disease disappears.  But it's vaccinated. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, but it's vaccinated.  It's not cured.  It wasn't cured.  If someone has smallpox,  they can't cure  the person with smallpox.  Well, the vaccine  was the cure.  No.  No.  That's what Patrice  is trying to say today.  Vaccines stop it from coming,  but it doesn't destroy  the disease.  The disease exists.  So if you don't get  the vaccination  for smallpox,  it eventually will come back.  It'll get you.  It'll get you.  Just like fucking chickenpox.  Is that what's happening  in L.A.  with the whooping cough?  Oh, I don't pay attention.  That shit's coming back.  Yeah, that's some  old school bullshit 
[02:48:00]  that we thought was cured, right?  They got the signs  in the parking lot  to the pharmacies.  Come in for your  whooping cough vaccine.  Yep.  Wow.  Because they need  to use these eggs  that they fucking  grew all the vaccines in.  These $500 million eggs.  I'm telling you,  fucking...  What's this year's disease  that we got to worry about?  Hey, guys,  I don't want to  slam the brakes on this.  I just want to do  a little callback, though.  You guys are talking  about Lamont and Tinelli?  I guess.  Lamont...  Geez, I forgot  about them already.  I went to school  at Lamont.  His real name 
[02:48:30]  is Todd Freifogel.  Yeah, I'm sure  he's a nice guy.  I'm sure Tinelli's  a nice guy.  I kind of feel bad  for him because  I think they used  to do a talk show  and now they  have to shut up  and play the music  in a couple,  you know,  horse shit bits.  Yeah.  I almost don't even  blame them for being hacky.  It's the business.  Well, they were hacky  when hacky was...  They were?  All right,  then fuck Lamont and Tinelli.  Fuck them.  All right, Ray.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Yep.  Yep. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, this guy's  seen the video.  Oh, the video  of Patrice was fired.  Oh, okay.  Can we get it up?  I want to see it now.  Can we get some footage?  Let's go to Mike  in Alabama.  Mike?  Hey, yeah, Patrice,  I've seen that video  you were talking about.  You can actually find it  on Danny's favorite  video site.  He fucked.  He fucked.  Yeah, but also,  same chick goes  into the slums of Japan  and just fucks  homeless people, too.  That's her thing.  Oh, this chick, yeah.  So she's got to have 
[02:49:30]  every disease.  I kind of dig it.  Now that you know  that she'll do anything,  aren't you slightly  attracted to  A.D. McFucking Jap?  I want to see that  Japanese chick  fucking just  disasters.  As Danny finds that video,  let me go to  Damon in Cleveland.  Damon, what's up?  Hey, my wife  works in AIDS research.  She met Maggie Johnson.  I got an autographed  picture with him.  He has HIV,  but since he's an athlete  and the medicines he gets,  he don't get  everyday medicines  like everybody else. 
[02:50:00]  He gets top-of-the-line stuff.  Wait, are you telling me  that they're holding back  the proper medicine  from other people?  There's two worlds.  There's the world  of the rich  that Anthony lived in  and there's the world  of the rest of the rich.  So why did  Rock Hudson die?  Because they didn't  have that shit.  No, they didn't have it.  That was early.  Pills aren't very  expensive to make.  And he was gay  and I think  it was a thing, you know?  It was a gay disease  as they said.  When did Magic Johnson  get it?  You know what?  But think about it.  You don't see the  really famous people 
[02:50:30]  dying of AIDS anymore.  They might be getting  the good shit.  That's true.  I'm thinking  there's really famous  people that have the AIDS.  Because we lost  Freddie Mercury  and we lost...  But that was early on  when they probably  didn't have the good shit.  Denim Elliott?  I kind of like  this guy's theory.  No, but I think...  Who was the last  really famous person  to die of AIDS?  Freddie Mercury.  No, there's been  one since then.  Denim Elliott died of it.  Not that we know of,  though.  Not that it's...  Denim Elliott?  Yeah.  Easy to mean.  Denim Elliott, yeah.  The guy from  The Heat of the Night.  Peter Allen? 
[02:51:00]  No, no.  The black guy.  Rollins.  Rollins.  Rollins.  Uh, Rollins.  Oh, right.  But I don't think  Henry Rollins  died of AIDS, man.  Henry Rollins?  No.  Not Henry Rollins.  Yeah.  Who should?  Uh, fucking, uh...  The black dude,  Rollins,  from Soldier Story.  It's a good point  that, you know,  it's been a while  since a real famous  person has died of AIDS.  Because the ones  that were dying first  was like,  they thought this was  gay guy's disease, 
[02:51:30]  so they wasn't really  trying to fuck  with this disease like that.  But also,  a lot of them  might keep it secret as well.  You gotta think  there's some fucking AIDS  in Hollywood, though.  No.  Yeah, maybe.  Alright, so why  aren't those guys dying?  Because now  everybody got AIDS.  Like, meaning  everyone can get it.  Before, it was like,  these homos get it.  It was like some shit.  You don't like this theory  that magic got the good shit?  No.  Yeah, he got some good shit.  No, I don't believe  if that ever came out  that the government  were holding back  good medicine,  it'd be fucking  meaty.  If it ever came out,  it's like, 
[02:52:00]  there's so many things  that come out  that this shitty government  does.  Why is it pixelated?  Thank you, Damon.  I've seen it  unpixelated.  She is sitting  on a giant  African  Did you have to put  the word giant there?  Isn't it implied?  Yeah, it should be.  She's having a tough time  getting it started.  Asians don't like  to have the cock in there.  They'll pixelate  the dog's cock,  but they won't pixelate  the shit covered  on her face.  I know.  Tubgirl is fine,  but pixelate  the pubic hair.  Here's the definition.  That's right. 
[02:52:30]  This chick flies  down Africa  and fucks a member  of a cannibalistic tribe.  Fake, probably,  although those  AK-47s look  relatively real.  The amount of effort  the Japanese  put into their pornos  never fails to amaze me.  See more videos  like this here  and here.  Oh, there you go.  But there was a condom  there, wasn't there?  No, they threw  the condom off.  They're trying to say  it's fake.  Yeah, fake.  And it was a cream pie, man.  Look at her.  This ain't fake.  That's not fake, man.  Why do you say  it's not fake 
[02:53:00]  by looking in her face?  It's a disaster.  Because I've seen  the whole thing.  You see the whole thing.  It's just real.  Because they got  the girls there, too,  the women  in the tribe.  Yeah, yeah.  And she's meeting  them and the kids  are like,  oogie googie.  It's not fake.  Oogie googie.  It's not fake, man.  You can't employ  oogie googies.  Oogie googie.  I mean,  that was very  cleverly done,  but I'm telling you,  if you watch it,  you'll know that  the difference  between hired  little black kids  and fucking 
[02:53:30]  African kids  in the jungle.  I mean,  I know you cannot,  but it's not fucking...  You could have never  got the Jackson 5  to play that off,  could you?  You couldn't have run out.  Nah, nah.  You need real  African kids.  Let's go to Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Morning, boys.  What's up?  Patrice,  I think you're  a little bit wrong.  They've cured  a couple diseases.  Namely,  say,  anthrax is cured  by Cipro.  Bubonic plague,  1347,  actually is cured  by antibiotics.  Anthrax is not 
[02:54:00]  really a disease.  It is a poison,  isn't it?  What about  spider bites?  Anthrax is a disease.  It's an airborne.  Yeah,  but they didn't cure it.  It's not cured, man.  Cipro cures it.  You could take Cipro  and it cured it.  Because it's a poison.  It's an antidote.  That's a different thing.  We're talking  cancer,  AIDS,  and the common cold.  Does it matter  if we have shit  that actually  makes it go away, though?  Yeah, I think  it is.  It's like a snake bite.  Is this a technicality, though?  Yeah,  it's just trying 
[02:54:30]  to prove a nigga wrong.  It's not.  We're not curing diseases,  but we got some shit  to make it fucking go away.  Yeah, I say  snake bite is also a disease.  Malaria isn't cured.  That's what he says.  Malaria can be cured,  absolutely,  with extract from a willow tree.  It's a...  It's a...  He can be cured  from malaria.  Malaria is a poison  you get from mosquitoes.  You cure that  with...  You cure that  with the fucking  actual mosquitoes  or the snake poison.  That's antidote.  No, no, no.  Malaria's not a poison.  It's caused by a parasite 
[02:55:00]  that infects  my feet.  Well, I'll have to Google it  because I don't believe you.  Google it, big man.  You're funny as shit.  Thank you.  Let me go to Mike  in Columbus.  Mike?  Gentlemen,  how you doing?  Hey.  Jim Jeffrey saw you  in Cleveland  a couple years ago.  Freaking amazing.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, he's a great comic  playing Caroline's  all weekend here in New York.  Go ahead, brother.  Absolutely.  Hey, I don't know  how you guys let this go,  but did you guys  hear Patrice say  about the Ebonic plague?  What are they doing? 
[02:55:30]  A bunch of dudes  sitting around going,  let me ask you something, brother.  You know,  the best thing for you  to do had just been  say Ebonic  instead of going on.  And I didn't have  a problem with that.  Lesson for you, sir.  I didn't have a problem  with that because earlier on  Patrice said,  who's Patrice?  I'm more concerned  about that one  than him messing up  a word.  Who's Patrice?  What's that?  Yeah, who?  Who's Patrice?  What's that?  The Ebonic?  That's an Ebonic plague.  That's fucked up.  Maybe I was mixing  Ebola and a Ebonic.  It happens, bitch.  It happens.  I always hate 
[02:56:00]  when people correct you  on words like that  because I do that all day.  You understand  what I'm saying.  Exactly.  Well, then you got Nick.  You know what?  You brought up something  good with this disease thing, Patrice.  Nick on Long Island.  Nick?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Oh, and people want  Dr. Steve on the phone  to...  He'll set it straight  as far as diseases  and if you cure them.  I'm not believing  that nigga either.  Fuck him.  Like, I don't believe  none of that shit.  They haven't cured  a fucking disease.  Alright, good point.  Ever.  Nick, what do you got next?  People are scared  because they want hope 
[02:56:30]  that there's going to be cures  but they're not.  They're not doing that shit.  They take your money  and they fucking buy your houses.  They've cured minor diseases  like skin conditions  are diseases, aren't they?  And they've gotten creams  and stuff that make them go away.  Antibiotics that cure things.  I feel that the government  has cured fucking cancer  and AIDS a long time ago  but all that shit  is so profitable  that why they just...  Man!  Man!  That's what I'm going to expose  on my conspiracy theory show.  I don't think...  Shut up. 
[02:57:00]  I absolutely believe  what this guy says.  Can I ask you, sir,  how is cancer profitable?  I absolutely believe  how is cancer profitable?  Medicine, doctors...  Are you fucking kidding me?  It's keeping a lot of people  in business.  I'll tell you one of the things  that really...  Such a fucking chemo machine  must cost $1 million.  I'm a cancer on television.  What are the things  that really...  I'm a cancer on entertainment.  I kind of believe that a little bit.  Yeah?  Yeah.  My point of the fact  that Ebola is gone 
[02:57:30]  is because it's not profitable.  Can I?  Can I?  So, wait a minute.  So, cancer and AIDS,  anything where you can stay alive  for years  and you have to buy medicine,  same thing with diabetes.  Why cure something  where you can actually live  a long life  and have to buy medicine?  Can I say something?  You're all wrong.  Who's holding the secret  fucking...  the real cure?  Fucking Monsanto, mom. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  So, everyone in Monsanto  never dies of cancer  because they have the cure.  Their kids never die of cancer  because they have the cure.  That's not the...  Come out and be exposed  some way, J-POP.  They have the cure,  but they're not going to give  to their mother  and their loved ones.  What you're saying  is the same theory  that I have about  the thing why I don't believe  in aliens  is that I don't believe  in, like,  everybody can keep  a mass secret like that.  Right, yeah.  But there's something  they do within corporations  because, for one, 
[02:58:30]  subordinates don't question anything.  They just do what  they're told to fucking do.  But there's got to be  the big cheese  that knows everything.  It could be.  That would give his mother  and his kids  the cure.  I just want to say  one thing.  Cancer is not profitable  in any other country  in the free world  besides America  because every other country  has government-funded  health care.  So government,  the word funded  means that there's  money involved.  No, that means  that the people  are getting free treatment. 
[02:59:00]  The people are getting  free treatment.  They're not getting  free treatment.  It costs the British  government  tens of hundreds  of thousands  It doesn't cost  the British government  anything.  It costs the people  because they're paying taxes.  So what they do  is that medicine  you put their money in  and you've got to  pay it back in.  It's the same shit.  It's the same exact shit.  I always get pissed off  whenever they go on  about someone who smokes.  Someone who smokes  lung cancer costs  30,000 pounds  on average to fix.  And he's like,  but that cunt's paid 
[02:59:30]  at least 80,000  in taxes  on cigarettes.  So he's ahead  of the game.  Yeah, I reckon  let that cunt  get the best room  with the best  lung cancer bed  insurance companies  are hoping  that they don't  have to pay out  to most cancer people  or most smokers.  So if there's  10 smokers  you go  10 pay 40,000  3 might get  lung cancer.  And they get  spent 30,000  so everybody  whatever you do  the math  somebody's making  money man. 
[03:00:00]  You think  fucking free  healthcare is  because people  love other people?  Get the fuck  out of here.  Canada and  all these countries  it's all money man.  Cancer is money  because you can live.  Let's go to  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Hi Steve.  How are you?  Patrice,  what was your  thought for Dr. Steve?  I didn't have  no thought  for Dr. Steve.  I just said it out loud  that there's no  diseases  that have been cured.  In case he wasn't listening.  No diseases  have ever been cured. 
[03:00:30]  The smallpox guy  I was actually right.  I do want to talk  about this cancer thing  but the smallpox virus  has been eradicated.  There has not been  a case of smallpox.  By vaccine.  I hear you.  Steve you use it.  But he's saying  is it impossible  at this point  to get smallpox?  No.  It is impossible  to get it  in the environment.  There hasn't been  a single case  even in unvaccinated  people  in X number of years.  Here's the problem.  Isn't it in  someone's attic though  it's there though 
[03:01:00]  they eradicated it  somewhere.  Could I make it  in the shade?  With vaccines though  Dr. Steve  they didn't get rid of it.  It's not in the environment.  It's not in the environment.  There's no smallpox vaccine  in the environment.  Not even in an Indian blanket.  Okay question.  Someone with smallpox  no longer had it.  That's a cure.  Meaning you had smallpox  and then you no longer  had smallpox.  I never  yeah but I didn't say  they had a cure  I said it's been eradicated.  Oh no.  Lots of things 
[03:01:30]  have been eradicated.  We're talking about cures.  They've eradicated polio.  So there's never  been a cure sir.  I've never cured  anybody with smallpox.  That's absolutely right.  But smallpox still exists  but it's in vials  in some  Can you name a disease  that has been cured?  And why are we  saving the smallpox?  To unleash it.  No because it's the cure.  Just like you're going  to see kids  with little  giant  you're going to see  kids with the  giant polio boots  soon again.  But if you don't  if there's no one  around that needs 
[03:02:00]  curing then get rid  of the fucking  smallpox.  Yeah but what if  the American Indians  rise again?  How do you get rid  of them?  Well then you fucking  take those people  to get the cure.  They're afraid that  oh it was a life  form and we should  preserve it for  knowledge but what's  going to happen is  some asshole is  going to break one  of those vials and  then we're going to  have smallpox.  But are we fucking  Star Trek with the  prime directive?  Kill it.  Kill it.  Where do they  keep these vials?  Is there a special  place?  Where is these?  They're in labs.  Dr. Steve's medicine 
[03:02:30]  cabinet.  All over the world.  It's in Dr. Steve's  wine that he  fucking sends us.  Dr. Steve you  was going to talk  about cancer you  said?  Well uh.  What a collectible  that would be.  A vial of smallpox  you could show  your friends.  That'd be great.  Put it on your  mantle.  Like 12 monkeys  you just open it up  and wave it under  the guy's nose at  the airport.  Yes Dr. Steve?  You guys were  talking about  cancer being  profitable and  I work in a  cancer center as  you know and  certainly the 
[03:03:00]  practice of  medicine in  cancer is not  profitable anymore.  It hasn't been  for some time.  Almost all of our  cancer centers are  heavily subsidized.  Now you could make  the argument.  But it's  pharmaceuticals.  Those are the  zillion dollar  companies.  because I read  somewhere there's  a hundred dollar  or a thousand  dollar pill.  A cancer pill  that's like a  thousand dollars.  Absolutely right.  Now I will say 
[03:03:30]  that the  pharmaceutical  companies have  never once  turned us down  when we needed  chemo for  somebody that  couldn't afford  it and they've  given it to us.  So that number  one shows how  much money they're  making off  everybody else  that they can  just give it  away in that  way.  But you could  make the argument  that the  pharmaceutical  companies are  somehow they  yes they have  the cure and  they're just  rolling out these  things a little  bit at a time  so that they  can make more  money off of  it.  But the  competition  between these  companies is  so intense that 
[03:04:00]  I cannot believe  that if somebody  had a quote  unquote cure  for cancer which  by the way is  a bunch of  different diseases  that one of  these companies  wouldn't have  just said fuck  the rest of  y'all I'm  going to make  a killing in  the short term  and go ahead  and roll it  out.  But don't you  think at some  point we should  as a I guess  like Jim said  it's almost an  American thing  when you think  that we should  just get since  we're so into  democracy in this  country that we  just vote on 
[03:04:30]  one disease that  will cure and  then we go to  the next because  all this fucking  diseases everywhere  else it ain't  winning meaning  let's just say  cancer is the  most important  thing and we  just key on  cancer as  opposed to  diabetes I'll  wait I'm  diabetes will  probably be  10th on my  list isn't  there a lot  of things like  even if you're  working for  these other  charities if  you're let's  say you're  doing a thing  for diabetes  you're doing  a thing for  muscular dystrophy  it's not just  about cure it's  about sustaining  their life in a  better comfort and 
[03:05:00]  that type of  thing right it's  also palliative  care and all  that right yeah  that's also money  that's being  devoted it's not  all going to the  cure that's what  I'm saying all  these benefits and  all this spending  when you give  charity money to  cancer it's not  going to the  cure incidentally  it's just maybe  better medication  it'd be nice to  see somebody cure  anything right  anything just  but what the  it's enough  enough money  enough fucking  uh tell the  45th annual  jerry's kids  yeah that's  never  and they got  60 year old 
[03:05:30]  people with  fucking ms  like I don't  know I just  gave 5,000  pounds to  muscular dystrophy  did you  yeah I donated  the money for  one of my  shows because I  do a 30  minute routine  I expect the  kids to lift  that  I see because  it's money  in your country  and for us  it's weight  because I was  doing that  uh yeah I was  doing uh I was  doing uh I was  doing uh that  that story about  my friend with  muscular dystrophy  I took to the  brothel right and  so I thought I  got him on the  dvd and I thought  all right so I'll  give the money from  the recording of  the dvd from the  show from the  audience I'll give 
[03:06:00]  that to charity  so it's a nice  little thing but  the thing is uh  because my mate  dan's in the story  and we're talking  about taking him to  a brothel now  dan can't even  lift his eyelids  like he's in a  completely vegetated  state completely  vegetated state  and the fucking tv  people at comedy  central like uh  yeah uh can we  get a signed  release from dan  and I'm like no  that ain't happening  what are you  talking about  he can't do shit  oh my god  he's that bad huh  yeah  was he that bad  when you guys  got him laid 
[03:06:30]  yeah yeah yeah  yeah yeah  you still hang  out with him  well when I'm in  Australia you know  how do you guys  communicate if he  he can still  talk but it's  just very muffled  and you know  he's not fucking  high-fiving you  sure  you know  yeah  he's lived to be  33 with that's  pretty pretty old  that's pretty old  for muscular dystrophy  yeah  still alive and  kicking  well let me  rephrase that  still alive  I used to  when I was in  Rochester I used  to work with  kids with muscular  dystrophy  it was rough  it's a bad one 
[03:07:00]  I finally had to  move on  because I mean  they were dying  all around us  yeah yeah yeah  it's fucking brutal  yeah  is there  hey Steve  is there anything  that's almost been  that's I mean  right now  that's close  very close  rickets  to being cured  lymphoma  or leukemia  you know  they've affected  quite a few  cures of people  with leukemia  with  stem cell transplant  or bone marrow  transplantation  and stuff  so you know 
[03:07:30]  we're working  on it  I mean  survival  goes up  every year  but you're  right  it's a real  slow  kind of  advance  rat spit  wants me  to ask you  about vitamin  b17  to fight  cancer  okay  yeah I don't  know anything  about that  Dr. Steve's  just like  alright whatever  I don't know  that shit  can I ask you  that  my brother  thinks that  vitamins are a  load of bullshit  are they a load  of bullshit  like if you  take vitamins  is it all  placebo effect 
[03:08:00]  that you think  you're doing  good by yourself  here's the thing  if you have  a vitamin deficiency  vitamins are great  I mean vitamins  are just nutrients  that our bodies  can't make  but they have  to have  to do their  daily  you know  duties  and stuff  and don't they  normally  just they're in  our food that we  eat  we get enough  if you're eating  a pretty good  balanced  fucking diet  you're alright  yeah  yeah  yeah  eat a balanced  diet  but  the  I mean  that's 
[03:08:30]  we were  created inside  our environment  and we  when we ate  a balanced  diet  we kind of  got most  of the nutrients  that we needed  but balanced  diet means  different things  to different  people  my mother-in-law  for example  was watching  my kids  one weekend  and I came  back  and she's  sort of  nutritionally  unsound  and I said  did they eat  a balanced  diet  and she said  well they ate  five pieces  of fried bologna  is that balanced  fried bologna  you married a woman 
[03:09:00]  whose mother  eats flied bologna  like  flied  fried  yes  is your wife  a bit trailer park  Steve  hey is there any  is there any  holistic anything  that's officially  good  so  yeah man  I mean  look  throw out a couple  of good natural  fucking products  all natural products  are bullshit  because they get  tested  and if they get  tested and they  work  they become  medicine  that's exactly  right  that's what I was  going to say  Jim  very good  there's a lot 
[03:09:30]  of things  like glucosamine  is a great  example  of something  that used to be  an quote unquote  alternative medicine  and they tested it  and it actually  works for arthritis  pain  it works as well  as ibuprofen  for most people  without any  of the side effects  and so now  you know  there are  very few  family practitioners  and orthopedists  who don't prescribe  glucosamine  so it's become  mainstream  so once  something is proven  to work  I mean  we'll use the  hell out of it  but echinacea is  bullshit isn't it  echinacea went 
[03:10:00]  through a few  studies that  showed that  maybe it  decreased  the length  of time  of a common  cold  by 30%  and then  the bigger  studies that  were done  showed that  it didn't  really do  anything  shit  so apple  cider vinegar  and fucking  all of that  stuff is  if it worked  it would be  medicine  well  yeah  and it depends  on what you're  using it for  if you're using  it to acidify  your urine  then apple  cider vinegar  works great 
[03:10:30]  but it  why would I  acidify my urine  sir  oh  you don't know  about that  this is what  they're going to  kill Dr. Steve  for giving out  too much  medical information  it's like  24  hunting him  down  helps to  suppress  bacterial growth  so a lot  of people  would normally  use cranberry  juice  because it's  a little more  palatable  than drinking  vinegar  but you could  drink vinegar  to acidify your  urine  to clean your  urinary tract  out like with  cranberry juice  right  because I 
[03:11:00]  fucked a lot  of women  who need  cranberry juice  the next day  I keep it  in the house  yeah  well that's  been  I'm quick  on the thrush  as well  and so  how about  horse shit  acai berries  and  acai berries  and all that  shit is nonsense  right  yeah well  they have  nutrients in them  acai berries  have nutrients in them  I've never seen  a single study  and that's what  you know  the thing that  you have to do  is you take  a hundred people  and you give  them acai berries  and you take  a hundred people 
[03:11:30]  that look  exactly the same  and do everything  else except  they don't take  the acai berries  and see  if there's any  difference  in whatever it is  that you're studying  and I've never  seen a single  study  that shows  that acai berries  do anything  other than  supply you  with some B vitamins  I was going to say  let's break it down  though  it tastes alright  and it's better  than eating  fucking french fries  yeah but  you just don't eat  the french fries  right there  it's healthier for you  yeah  it might be full of vitamins  but it's all bullshit  if people think  it's medicine  but it's not a magic  fucking cure  it's all these  you know that's why  I'm asking 
[03:12:00]  there's gotta be  a magic one out there  we're all looking  for the magic cure  whether it's a pill  or a stupid berry  you go to these  Chinese doctors  or whatever  and they give you  a fucking bag  of sticks  fucking sticks  and they live  and then you boil it  in water  and you're meant  to drink it  tastes horrible  and I've never  I tried it a couple  of times  never fucking worked  they live a long time  fucking Chinese people  man  but  don't live a long time  you just think that  because they all  look the same  and they're just  replacing each other  there's billions of them  going with the Chinese  people  Dr. Steve  acupuncture 
[03:12:30]  is that horse shit  that's been around  forever right  not horse shit  I'm asking  thousands of years  several decent studies  have shown  that acupuncture  has real effects  on the body  and for things like  pain  and some other  parameters like that  and it's hard  to do a double blind  placebo controlled  study with acupuncture  because how do you  give somebody  fake acupuncture  so they're mostly 
[03:13:00]  observational studies  but they're pretty good  studies  that's not a medicine  that's a technique  it's like saying massage  you can't tell  but you know  you feel better afterwards  what would you say  what would you say  Dr. Steve  is like  where you go  this particular  group of doctors  is nonsense  like chiropractors  or anybody  where you go  nonsense  yeah there's one  called radionics  and what they do  is they have  it's just this machine  and it has a bunch  of dials on it  that's a bit 
[03:13:30]  I don't know a whole lot  about it  but I know  they submitted  an article  to the journal  that I edit  and what they had  was they had  these quotes  from this person  and they said  it was the  discorporate interview  that they did  with this person  I kept reading  this article  and reading it  then I finally realized  that what discorporate  meant was  the person was dead  but they were  giving quotes  which means  that they had  channeled this person  to get the quotes  so that one 
[03:14:00]  to me  at least from  the basis  of that article  is complete horse shit  but you know  I'm sure there's  some radionics  anything that involves  chi is bullshit  so you're helping me  out right now  Dr. Steve  by there's a lot  of crackers  out there  that I'm sickening  because I said  something  and they wanted  they was praying  that you proved me wrong  but you proved me  correct right sir  what's that  there was no cure  ever for anything 
[03:14:30]  oh wait a minute now  you already said it  Steve  you already said it  don't go back now  don't be racist  now Steve  we eradicated  smallpox  but it was not cured  a person with smallpox  did not have it  and then  and then the next day  not  a person  didn't have it  and then the next day  didn't  it must be skin diseases  that have been cured  but if you have a cure  for it 
[03:15:00]  you know what I mean  it's like a technicality  this Patrice O'Neill  like if you have a disease  and they definitely  have a medicine  that is guaranteed  to cure it 100%  what are we talking about  we're talking about  curing  we're saying  smallpox still  somewhere  could pop up somehow  no  well only if it comes  out of the lab  and if you have it  you can't then  just get rid of it  Kenya  yeah that's the thing  so where's he  where's he bowl at  where's he bowl at  it's just gone  right now  but it could come back  because it wasn't cured 
[03:15:30]  that's all I'm saying  okay  thank you Dr. Steve  appreciate it  can you hang up on him  thanks Dr. Steve  thanks for calling man  appreciate it  nice talk to you sir  make your point  God bless you  anything else Steve  no  because it's weird medicine  this weekend  midnight  after Sam and Dave  alright  very good  thank you Dr. Steve  have a good weekend Brian 
[03:16:00]  I like Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve is great  and Jimmy does the best  impression of Dr. Steve  you know what  why do we hang up  on Dr. Steve  when this phone call  is sitting by  I got it  I'll field it  well call  call Dr. Steve  though  back  because now I need  to know if this is  possible  Chris go ahead  yeah I was going  to ask a question  to Dr. Steve  I had a friend  tell me one time  he used to eat  a lot of vitamin C  and his girlfriend  used to get  a lot of sore throat  one night 
[03:16:30]  they were having sex  and he had  pain in her mouth  and she swallowed it  and it instantly cured  her sore throat  and had a cat  instantly  do we really need  to call Dr. Steve  on this guy  for vitamin cum  you see what the  problem with that is  this is just what  Dr. Steve was saying  you have to have  a hundred people  who had too much  vitamin C  come into an  infected girl's mouth  and a hundred normal  guys come into  a girl's mouth  hold on  that's the only way  you can tell  Dr. Steve's trying 
[03:17:00]  to get to work  but Dr. Steve  did you hear  that last phone call  no  why would you  listen to our show  Chris why don't you  explain to Dr. Steve  he's on the line  hi Dr. Steve  I had a friend  one time  he told me  that he used  to eat a lot  of vitamin C  and he was having  sex with his girl  for one time  it came in her mouth  and it instantly  cured her  throat infection  I want to know  if that's true  could that happen  well dude 
[03:17:30]  I wasn't there  but he said  it instantly  did what  cured her  sore throat  oh no  I'm not scared  fuck off  that's bullshit  fuck off  that's bullshit  there you go  if he was  if he was  splooging  penicillin  maybe  but vitamin C  isn't a cure  for strep throat  in the first place  maybe just  his cock  just bashed  the back  of the disease  out  yeah  she could have  had like  an abscess 
[03:18:00]  in her tonsil  and he  popped it  with  wow  wow  so from now  on  that's not  could have  that's what  happened  Jesus man  oh my god  and then it felt better  alright  thank you for that  tidbit of information  Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve  what shitty breakfast  are you eating  this morning  I'm skipping breakfast  this morning  but I'll  eat a hearty lunch  but breakfast  is the most important  meal of the day  every doctor 
[03:18:30]  should know that  well  do as I say  that ain't not  what I do  I learned that  personally  when I was  calling up  with a  heart to heart  talk with Dr. Steve  about my heart  and how to keep  it healthy  and he's ordering  fucking fast food  I'm not gonna  let you live  that one down  there sir  it was a number  two you said  I was just hoping  you'd get off  the phone  before I had  to order  he's a typical  doctor  these guys know  what this shit  does to their  bodies  but they don't  9 out of 10  doctors smoke  lucky strike cigarettes  why are you smooth  on the throat 
[03:19:00]  why are you  doctors like that  well I'll tell you  in my case  it really is  a matter of time  I'm too fucking  lazy to pack  my own lunch  and then I get  behind and I've  got five minutes  to eat  and there's  Chick-fil-A  or Hardee's  right there  Dr. Steve  what I remember  in university  the med students  were always  at the parties  they would be  always on  ecstasy and coke  were you a drug  taker when you  were younger  or if you don't  want to own up  to that  when you went  to university  or college  as they call it  over here 
[03:19:30]  were all the  other med students  on drugs  we had  several people  who I knew  personally  that liked  to imbibe  in recreational  substances  I'll tell you  one thing  Jim  what we did  in ear nose  and throat  lab  was we would  practice on  each other  taking the  fiber optics  and putting it  down our nose  and looking at  each other's  vocal cords  right  sure I've had  that done  I had nodges  on my vocal  cords  I've had  that done  yeah so  we had this  lab where  you had to  do that  it was one 
[03:20:00]  of the  requirements  well they  had this  blue solution  that you  would put  on cotton  and you  jam it  up each  other's  noses  and to  numb it  up  well we  didn't know  it was  pharmaceutical  grade  cocaine  by the  end of the  day after  jamming  10 or  15 of  these  cotton  pledgets  up each  other's  nose  you know  we were  wondering  why  rounds  all of a  sudden  was much  more fun  than it  ever happened  I bet you  there was  a lot  of cocky  med  students  that day  just walk  around going  yeah I'll  get a  fucking  doctorate  by the  end of  the  year  but 
[03:20:30]  we have  people in  our class  that after  one use  of  pharmaceutical  grade  cocaine  were plotting  how they could  break into  the lab  and steal  the stuff  so that's  how powerful  a drug  that stuff  is  what would  that stuff  be called  chemically  if I was  to find it  somewhere  and purchase  it  what would  that be  called  it was  something like  methyl ergoconate  or something  like that  it was a  really weird  I mean  and it wasn't  it's actual  name 
[03:21:00]  it was sort  of a  pseudo  trade name  for it  and I can't  remember it  now  but  yeah it had  another name  it didn't say  pharmaceutical  grade  cocaine  on the  label  cocaine  oh my god  Danny just  found the  best website  pharmaceutical  cocaine  I haven't  heard a word  you've said  in the last  five minutes  it's a  hysterical  sight  yeah  all right  Dr. Steve  go to work  help people  cure people  and you eat  shitty  later  all right  Dr. Steve
