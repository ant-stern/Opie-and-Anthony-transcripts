<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion about a mistakenly aired image of Russian ships during a DNC tribute to the Navy, followed immediately by a somber reflection on the anniversary of 9/11.  This included a poignant story about a car left untouched in a driveway for eleven years after its owner's death on that day, prompting a discussion about dealing with the belongings of deceased loved ones, including saved voicemails. Opie shared that he had kept a voicemail from his late comedian friend, John Fox.  The hosts then compared their own approaches to saving versus discarding items, with Opie revealing a highly organized hoarding habit and Anthony taking a more discarding approach.  This led to anecdotes about donating unwanted items in Manhattan, including a story about St. Vincent de Paul confiscating pellet guns. The conversation then shifted to the emotional impact of 9/11 memorials, particularly firehouses, before sharply pivoting to NBC airing a segment on Kris Jenner's breast implants at 8:46 AM on 9/11. This sparked a lengthy and critical discussion of the Kardashians, their show, and Kim Kardashian’s comparison of her divorce to a cancer diagnosis. The hosts delved into the family's background, appearance, and dynamics, including speculation about Khloe Kardashian's paternity.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the O.J. Simpson trial, focusing on the glove evidence and potential tampering,  the roles of key players like Johnnie Cochran, Robert Shapiro, Chris Darden, and Marcia Clark, and a private investigator’s claim of evidence implicating O.J. Simpson's son, including a potential murder weapon. The poor quality of the video showcasing this claim was also criticized.

The next segment resumed the O.J. Simpson trial discussion, criticizing Chris Darden and praising Johnnie Cochran. This transitioned into a discussion of a “When Will We Forget” list detailing when most people will no longer remember specific historical events.  The hosts debated the list's methodology and its starting point.  The death of Johnny Cash and the MTV Video Music Awards controversy surrounding his loss to Justin Timberlake were also discussed. A significant portion of this segment focused on the conjoined twins, Abby and Brittany Hensel, and their TLC show.  The hosts played clips, analyzed their situation, and engaged in crude and vulgar humor regarding their bodies and sexuality, speculating on their daily lives and sexual activity. The hospitalization of Jerry Lawler and a planned call from Honey Boo Boo’s mother were briefly mentioned, along with plans to incorporate clips from the Hensel twins' show in future broadcasts.

The following segment started with a discussion of a poorly photoshopped image of two women performing oral sex.  This quickly shifted to Mike Tyson's daytime talk show, including clips showcasing his dating advice and a rowdy audience. A clip of Mike Francesa falling asleep on air was played and promised for their Facebook page.  The hosts then discussed the Yankees, followed by a detailed account of a studio equipment malfunction involving microphone stands and a control board, leading to blame-placing among staff members, including Mars and Gary.  This segued into a discussion of Mars's pun-based t-shirts, their humor, and potential legal issues, leading to a tangent about Fatty Arbuckle and a graphic anecdote regarding a rape accusation. A news story about a man's partial penis amputation during a circumcision was discussed, followed by a discussion of Larry Flynt and a lengthy impersonation of scenes from "Forrest Gump," particularly focusing on Forrest's wife, Susan. The segment concluded with mentions of a Led Zeppelin video teaser, Jesse Ventura's presence outside the studio, a planned Honey Boo Boo’s mother guest appearance, and a brief mention of Mike McQueary's lawsuit against Penn State.


The final segment began with a discussion of a salty snack, its texture, and a comparison to watching someone eat Doritos.  This transitioned to a discussion of a co-worker, Kenny, and speculation about his potential autism.  The hosts then speculated on McQueary's potential lawsuit following his departure from the show.  The conversation moved to Penn State's losing streak and the Jerry Sandusky scandal, expressing sympathy for Paterno's family while also finding humor in the situation. The upcoming appearance of June Shannon (Mama June from *Honey Boo Boo*) and the show's high ratings compared to a Bill Clinton speech were discussed.  A significant portion involved the hosts' attempts to get Kenny’s attention through the studio window, describing his appearance and his attempts to avoid them. The attempted interview with June Shannon was largely unsuccessful, ending abruptly with her hanging up. The hosts then discussed the failed interview, their behavior,  June Shannon's daughter's two thumbs, and the possibility of a thumb transplant.  This led to a call with Dr. Steve, discussing the procedure, and concluding with a discussion of a scheduling error and further off-color banter expressing displeasure with June Shannon and the *Honey Boo Boo* show. The segment concluded with a plug for upcoming shows and appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  What happened?  Hi!  You were heard in the background. What were you saying?  Oh, that the Russian ships were shown during a tribute, during the Democratic National Convention.  They were doing some kind of tribute and showing the Navy.  And it was a fleet of Russian ships.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oops.  Whoops.  Oopsie.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow. 
[00:00:30]  Ha, ha! Noises!  Apparently that gets stuck in people's heads. I was reading that on Twitter.  A little bit.  Morning, everybody!  Hi!  What day is today, Wednesday?  I believe what they call hump day in the radio biz. Hump day.  Yuck.  Happy hump day, everybody!  September 12th.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. Good. 
[00:01:00]  Good.  Those days, you just want them to fucking move along.  Yeah.  Well, we got into it.  I was realizing we got into it a lot deeper yesterday than we usually do.  Really?  As far as anniversaries go.  Yeah.  I don't know why, but a lot of people are kind of like feeling bummed out and everything.  Which is fine, you know.  They're just reflective.  Yeah.  A little reflection.  What are you supposed to do every year?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's fucked up.  I don't know how to handle that.  I was reading an article in the paper today.  Some guy who died on 9-11.  He, let's see, he has an old car, picks up his mom to bring her to the cemetery to visit 
[00:01:30]  her mom.  Yeah.  Drives her back home, parks the car in the driveway, and goes in and is never seen  again because he died on 9-11.  That car is still in the driveway, has never been touched.  That's creepy.  And the mom's like, look, I don't want to get rid of any of his stuff because that's  like wiping away his memories.  That's a weird thing, hanging on to people's stuff.  Materialistic.  How much do you hang on to and what do you get rid of? 
[00:02:00]  I mean, that's a tough call.  Well.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is a tough call.  Zoinks.  What about all the people that died on 9-11, like that just was in car accident or just  fucking natural causes?  Right.  It's like, oh yeah, he died on 9-11.  Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  No, not in the buildings.  Oh, then who gives a shit?  How many people's computers were like left open or like imagine how many spouse people  died on 9-11 or other ways where they just like, you're so not prepared to die and  your stuff is still in the house and then your wife goes, opens your computer or whatever. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  Oh, that's what you worry about?  Not me, because there's really nothing on there that people would be surprised at.  Yeah, true.  Like, oh, he did like this.  But, like, how many spouses find stuff like that after a death?  That's got to be terrible.  Well, it's in the New York Post today.  It's, um, the car's a 1988 Mercury and it's just been sitting in the driveway ever since.  Wow.  The wheels have gone flat.  It hasn't been moved an inch.  Ooh, that's kind of weird.  For 11 years.  A little strange, right? 
[00:03:00]  That is kind of odd.  I mean, people all mourn in different ways, so you can't, like, you can't fault her.  This is what she has decided she needs to do.  You know what the oddest thing is?  Voicemails.  That's, like, weird.  The thing on the phone.  Yeah.  Where you hear, like, hi, leave a message.  And, uh, it's creepy because they're dead.  It's not telling you to leave a message.  I saved the voicemail I got.  A friend of mine called me.  He was sick recently before he died.  And I saved his voicemail.  Really?  Yeah.  Who?  Anyone we know.  John Fox.  He was a comedian. 
[00:03:30]  Good old John Fox.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  But, uh, I say, I absolutely said, and he sent me a card.  I mean, that's cards, I would say, but the voicemail I have.  Well, then again, you save everything.  That's why I'm saying.  You pretty much saved your own boogers at this point.  It's hard to.  Oh, you can't all eat them.  Fuck.  I do that as well.  I thought I had you.  I thought I had you.  Fuck.  But, uh.  No, you save a lot more than the average person's room.  So that's kind of why I get it.  Like, if it was a dead son or something, eh, I don't know. 
[00:04:00]  Did you put it in a plastic tray and label it and stack it up in your closet?  What?  I don't know.  You seem to do that with your little cords.  Your electrical cords.  I do.  You file things away.  Yeah.  You're a very organized hoarder.  I have iPod cords in my thing, but they're organized.  Of course you do.  It has to be.  Why?  It's so organized.  Because I go over there and throw stuff away.  It would make me very happy.  I have floppy disks.  Yeah.  I bet you I could convince you to throw a lot of shit away.  You're probably right.  There's a lot of shit.  I'm not that attached to a lot of it.  Especially technology shit.  Yeah, I agree.  And then you realize all those dumb cords, if you really needed one of them, it's, what, 
[00:04:30]  seven, ten bucks?  Who cares?  Dude, I just found stuff I still have from my old Dell laptops.  Yeah.  And my Dell, and my old Toshiba laptop.  It's like, what am I going to need a cord from 1998?  You're not.  That would drive me insane.  Yeah, I will get rid of something to clear up some space.  But I think it goes back to, I always had a, I was always moving, so I didn't have the  luxury of keeping my shit.  You don't save iPod stuff?  Oh, my God.  I throw stuff away that people would be like, what the fuck?  Oh, you don't?  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  It's bad, just to get it out of the house.  My mother couldn't do that.  I'm waiting to try to figure out who I could give this to, or find one of those charity  boxes.  Right.  Sometimes I'm like, I just got to get rid of it now.  You're better off.  You're better off.  I do give away a lot of stuff, though, because now I'm going to hear from the idiots.  But in general, I have to throw shit away.  Yeah.  I have an iPhone that I smashed in L.A.  And I have it, because there's no way to do it, but Lance Reddick had left me a message  who was Daniels on The Wire, the black lieutenant, and we had him in after that. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, yeah, we did.  But that was when Michael K...  And I smashed it, and I never got the voicemail off it, so I'm so mad at myself, because  I'm like, I would love to pull...  Even though we've interviewed him, I don't know why I need it.  We talked to him.  Yeah.  I have video with him, but I still...  I'm such an OCD idiot.  You can get that.  I don't know how, dude.  I was very angry when I threw this phone.  I got a guy.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got a guy.  All right.  I'm worried he can see what else is on there, because I don't know yet.  Yeah.  Well, I think I got someone that could get that for you easily.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I smashed my phone recently, and they got everything back. 
[00:06:00]  I was very happy.  Okay.  Extremely happy.  I lucked out on that one.  So you think I should throw my cords out?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so, too.  Oh, my God.  Do you save clothes and all that?  I'm good with...  I actually go through it.  Recently, I went and dumped a lot of them.  Yeah.  But I saved clothes a lot longer than I should, but I was just raised with that mentality that  poor people don't have things, and you can't throw it out.  You can't waste clothing, because there's people that can't afford it.  Put it in a big garbage bag and find a Dropbox, which is almost impossible in Manhattan, by 
[00:06:30]  the way, because they don't give a fuck about people in Manhattan.  They may believe they do, but they don't care.  These churches...  Real estate is so expensive.  Even one of those bins would cost...  You could put a magazine stand where those go.  I'm talking about churches, though, man.  I mean, when you have a kid, you got a lot of shit, and you want to donate to somebody  because the kid outgrows it.  We couldn't find one church that would take our shit.  What would they say?  And a lot of it was nice, and some of it was brand new that we just never used. 
[00:07:00]  They don't have charity boxes, for whatever reason, in Manhattan.  You should have said to them, hello, this is good stuff, and then pointed at your skin.  Look who this is coming from.  Hello.  Whatever the fuck it's called.  You know, those bins.  What is it?  St. Jude, or I don't know.  Yeah.  So we had to wait and drive it out to Long Island.  But you didn't throw it out.  Well, no.  I mean, I don't throw it...  No.  You know, I do try to do the right thing, but sometimes it's just easier to get out of  the house immediately. 
[00:07:30]  St. Vincent de Paul.  Yeah, one of those stupid things.  I remember St. Vincent de Paul came and took my pellet gun.  Really?  I was very upset.  We were moving into a place in East Islip, and when we went to look at the place, we went  through the garage.  Yeah.  And the garage was full of, like, the coolest shit, and me and my brother saw, like, pellet  guns, pellet rifles, and we were just like, oh, and me and Joe did nothing but talk about  how cool these pellet rifles were, and how we were going to fucking have them, and go  around shooting shit, and it was going to be great.  And then when we went to move in, we came there, and there was a St. Vincent de Paul 
[00:08:00]  truck in the driveway, backed in, and we go to the house, and we're like, huh, and the  garage was empty, and they had loaded it all in the St. Vincent de Paul truck, and me and  Joe were like, they took the pellet guns.  Were you annoyed?  Oh, I...  I'm still annoyed at St. Vincent de Paul, because they took away such fun we would have had  shooting those pellet guns.  Who decided they needed to get rid of all that stuff?  I guess the previous tenants had said, take everything in the garage. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, I see.  So they backed up and took everything.  Oh, I see.  It was their shit.  But me and Joe had looked, and we were like, oh, this is great.  So why don't you guys grab those fucking pellet guns and move them?  Because we were kids and couldn't do anything without parental consent, and we just thought  it was going to be there.  Parental consent?  You didn't have parental...  You didn't even have parents, really.  What are you talking about?  Back then, I did.  Oh, you did sort of?  Yeah, that was still during the time where they were putting that charade on.  Oh, okay.  They were actually parents and a married couple.  Yeah.  Happy.  Well, maybe not happy.  But boy, were we pissed. 
[00:09:00]  Did you guys find 9-11 a little weird yesterday walking around?  The firehouses were a little weird.  It was not weird.  I mean, it was kind of nice and everything, but a lot of flowers.  They had a lot of these big floral arrangements in front of the firehouses that came by.  They had open houses all over the place.  Yeah, yeah.  I stopped by the one near us, the one on, what the fuck would it be, 66?  Oh, where the traffic was?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck is that road?  66, then not Amsterdam. 
[00:09:30]  Amsterdam, I think.  Yeah, the boys over there had a nice display.  Yeah, there's one at like...  They lost a lot of guys, too.  Oh, they did?  In that one, yeah.  I think they lost 14 over there.  Jesus.  They also, on 8th Avenue, the one Obama went to on 8th Avenue in the 40s, I think they  lost a good amount of people.  There's one by the old Boston Comedy Club in the village where I think they lost a lot.  Yeah, there's one.  That's the one I passed yesterday was on 8th and in the 40s.  Yeah.  It's on a corner.  Yeah, that's the one.  That's the one I passed by yesterday.  That's the one absolutely Obama visited last year. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  For the 10th.  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I passed that one yesterday, and they had a bunch of flowers out front, and they got a  big mural-type thing on one of the doors that was up there with all the guys' names on  everything.  It's just such an ugh.  When you pass by, you're like, ugh.  I mean, it's nice and everything.  You know, hey, tribute and everything.  But it just leaves you with such an ugh feeling.  What do you say when you, like, the president, when he shows up at a place?  How do you do?  It would be funny if he had an attitude about where he was. 
[00:10:30]  How do you do?  Like, almost like a musical.  How do you do, Mr. President?  How do you do?  I think what you say is, I didn't vote for you.  Yeah.  Why are you here?  Get out of here, and then you drop a bomb.  But if you're that confused people, let's say you're a fire guy, and all of a sudden  the president's literally in your firehouse, like, feet away from you, but you don't like  the guy.  But do you start liking the guy because he's in your firehouse?  Maybe.  How does that work?  I imagine you do.  Like, all of a sudden you change your tune, as they say?  Did you see, what do they say? 
[00:11:00]  Every shake, every hand you shake is X amount of votes.  Really?  Like, you ever see Frost Nixon, where the guy is going, Nixon's a crook, I would never  even talk to him.  And then Nixon walked into the room, and he goes, hi, I'm Richard Nixon, and the guy's  like, hi.  Hi, yeah, yeah.  You just, these guys alpha male everybody.  There's no way you...  So you think all it takes is a handshake, and somebody could change their vote?  Yeah, because I...  I think you're right.  In most cases, not all cases.  But I think a majority of people. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I think you're right.  So if Obama comes to your firehouse, I think he's turning some people around.  Yeah.  Or if it goes to your workplace, or whatever.  An acknowledgement, or a personal moment with the most powerful guy on the planet, is  more, probably more swaying than convictions you had beforehand.  Right.  Like that connection with a guy who is just...  Yeah.  Because now you've got a story for the rest of your life, so you almost feel like you  owe him.  Yeah.  Like, what, do you remember me?  What do you not?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  What do you say if you're Obama and you walk...  Or any president? 
[00:12:00]  Like, you have to go to these places and talk to people, and engage them, and be polite  banter.  It's like, what do you say to a bunch of guys who lost their friends, and...  You have your set shit that you say.  I guess so.  Yeah, it's a set.  You can't off-the-cuff anything when you're the president.  You really can't.  Well-prepared.  In this day and age, one slip-up, and you're fucked.  So, I guess years ago, you used to be able to just go off.  Not anymore.  No.  Like Truman.  Truman could just say shit.  He was Truman.  Remember yesterday, we were talking about the TV stations and when do they move on? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Everyone is talking about what NBC did yesterday.  Yes.  So, what do you think?  You know what?  I fucking hate the Kardashians, so, you know.  Yeah.  So, I'm loving this story, but I'm kind of hypocritical, because we were saying yesterday,  when do you move on?  You know what?  And NBC decided yesterday was the day to move on.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Because, you know, year after year after year, at 846, I believe, right, they go with the 
[00:13:00]  moment of silence?  Yeah.  On TV.  They literally just shut down for a little bit.  Yep.  And NBC said, fuck that.  We need to talk to Kris Jenner about her implants.  You know what?  If it was a story that was something a little more important, then I could see them doing  that.  But for Kris fucking, who is it?  She's stupid Kim Kardashian's mom there.  For that, no.  She basically wants to be more famous than Kim Kardashian.  For that, I think it's fucking, it's disrespectful in a way. 
[00:13:30]  I think you're right.  I mean, in a way, I guess I don't blame them for moving on.  If there was a, let's say there was a tornado somewhere, and they wanted to talk about  tornado damage in the Midwest, that I could see.  Like, they go to a report, it was a pertinent story.  Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.  Basically, they picked the wrong fucking story.  Right.  There was a million stories yesterday they could have picked.  Yeah, yeah.  But they decided to go with the fluff piece at 846.  Oof.  Yeah.  And they, and their argument back was, well, we did a lot of 9-11 coverage. 
[00:14:00]  Of course we, but I think a moment is, it's almost like, I agree with you, like,  eh, it's kind of, you gotta let go, you gotta move on.  But how hard is it to just give a moment of silence for all these New Yorkers?  These are civilians that were killed.  Yeah.  This wasn't a fucking, a military operation.  These were civilians.  I don't really have a problem with them.  At NBC, even though it's national, they broadcast in the heart of Manhattan.  Yeah.  They just picked the wrong story.  Yeah.  The fluffiest of fluff pieces. 
[00:14:30]  These stupid Kardashians.  Move on.  Not with that.  Yuck.  She got, I guess, the latest, keeping up with the Kardashians, she got breast implants  or something, and she was showing everybody.  I know this shit for whatever reason.  I wouldn't even be able to tell you if that show was still on.  Like, that's a monster number.  Amazing to me.  It just shows you what America's about.  We're, ugh.  Ugh.  Yeah.  I understand people want to watch some of this shit, but to the extent they do, I don't  and will never understand that.  And that's not because I'm getting older.  I've always felt this fucking way.  It's like the cake boss.  It's a, some shows are a distraction. 
[00:15:00]  Like, it's such a, it's such nonsense.  It's just like, there's nothing in reality I can connect to in this show.  But then NBC goes, oh my god, no, we gotta, we gotta do a piece on our, well, here it  is, if you want to hear it real fast.  That's backpedaling, by the way.  Oh, we, you know, it's time to move on.  Stop.  Yeah, what's the, uh, what's the scoop?  Yeah, so at 846, while everyone else went silent for the 11th year in a row, I believe,  uh, this is what NBC aired.  Well, I, one of the last things we saw was you getting wheeled into a breast enhancement 
[00:15:30]  surgery, which I gotta say, I know you guys are all forbearing it all, but is there ever  a time when you're like, okay, we can turn those cameras off now?  You know what?  I thought it was such a great idea to film that, because the reason I went in and did  that was because I had had my implants in for 152 years.  You know, a long...  It's like enraging.  Can NBC do another dumb thing?  They are the worst!  They are, what, what dummies they're acting, what are you guys doing?  They're, they're giving up their number one spot, really.  Their news organization is a disaster. 
[00:16:00]  Good Morning America is like, pretty much, uh, moving forward.  Yeah.  And moving past them at this point, and then they do dumb shit like this.  This broad, talking about our implants, at 846 in the morning, when everyone else is like  really taking that, that moment seriously.  The replacement building is still going up.  Right.  For whatever reason, it should have been up already.  Right.  But if people say, when do we move on?  How about when there's no more construction at Ground Zero, due to the fact that Muslims  knock down buildings?  Right, exactly. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  That's a good rule of thumb.  That might be a good time.  How about when the fucking cranes are out of Ground Zero?  Yes.  I think the news director over there is a dummy.  Yeah.  There's a better way to do this.  Yeah.  I'm not, I'm not, you know, disagreeing that they're moving on, but just the way they did  it.  They didn't do a split screen or anything, right?  Yeah.  I would have done like kind of a split screen, here's what's happening down, you know, Ground  Zero, so we want to acknowledge that is happening and everyone's thinking about this  today.  And then maybe do, not a fluff, this is a fluff piece.  Yes, total.  Because they could have done. 
[00:17:00]  Do the weather.  Do something so like, who gives a fuck?  Here's why they did that, because they were saying a lot of people are sick of this and  want to move on, so we're going to get the audience that is ready to move on.  Like, they wanted to get all the people that wanted nothing to do with thinking about 9-11.  Well, so maybe they really thought this out and said, okay, what is the big fucking thing  we could do right now in this spot?  I think it'll hurt them in the end, though.  I think you're right.  I think they got a big bump today, everyone's going to talk about it, but I think, you know,  down the road, people are going to be like, what's wrong with you fucking people? 
[00:17:30]  Their news division, you're right, is terrible.  It's a joke.  Has been terrible.  It's become a joke.  Why is, quote, shock jocks, we took it more seriously than supposedly a news organization?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If Tosh joked about this or Tracy joked about this, it would be all over the place.  I mean, this is actually all over the place, but I mean, no one's going to get fired for  it.  Here's the rest of the clip.  And for 152 years, you know, a long time, way longer than their shelf life.  They're only supposed to last 150 years.  I know.  It's like, you know, take them out, change them after 10 years, and that was a big message 
[00:18:00]  and important for me to sort of put out there in a comical way, like I made fun of myself  because at my age, you're over 50, like, when do you stop?  But it was so important health-wise to remind women that, you know, check your expiration  date because it's a health risk.  And so just to point that out to people that are my age, that anybody that's done this,  I had my implants done in 1989, and that was a long time ago.  She's such a fucking loser. 
[00:18:30]  She's worth so much fucking money, but she just lies.  She did it because it made for shocking TV.  And old broad getting new implants.  How old is she?  And the old ones removed.  She's got to be fucking 50, 50.  I don't know, because she's had so much plastic surgery.  She's kind of sexy, though.  Isn't she, Father Luan?  Yeah, she's...  Is she right?  No, she's...  Let me see her sound.  Look at the forearms.  When the forearms start sagging, that's a problem.  Look at the forearms are sagging. 
[00:19:00]  The forearms...  When the forearms start sagging, that's bad.  That's when you're fucking...  Your expiration date is over.  Not even the bottom of the bicep.  No, it's right here.  It's on the forearms sagging.  That's some tight skin.  That means she's got to be pushing 60.  Yeah.  How old is this stupid broad?  God, I hate this family.  What's that over there where it said photos?  Go back.  The only one I hate is Robert Kardashian.  Down on the lower...  Yeah, what the fuck?  That's after she got her stupid lips pumped up.  Her collagen in her lips. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, you know, it gets really swollen, and then I guess it goes down eventually.  That's pretty bad.  To give that duck pill look.  That duck face.  And then Kim Kardashian, I guess, was described...  What did she say, Sam?  She said fighting her divorce was like fighting cancer or something.  What the fuck is wrong with these people?  What was the quote?  Because people are pissed off at that, too.  Right, right.  Yeah.  What was the exact quote? 
[00:20:00]  Compared televising wedding?  What does the headline say?  She basically knows how it is to have cancer at this point,  because of what she went through.  Kim Kardashian compares televised wedding to cancer diagnosis.  What is that?  They're just idiots.  They really are dumb.  But, you know what?  America fucking laps it up, so...  Yep.  Keep lapping it up.  She said,  I spoke to a girl today who had cancer,  and we were talking about how this is such a hard thing for her,  but it taught her a big lesson on who her friends are 
[00:20:30]  and so much about life.  She's 18, and I was like,  that's how I feel.  She feels what?  In reference to her divorce.  She feels like she learned the same lessons  that this girl who was 18 learned from having cancer.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  She's got the most privileged life,  and then she has to go down to that level for a little attention?  Why are we saddled with the Kardashians? 
[00:21:00]  I thought we were done with them after OJ.  Yeah, no, I don't...  We don't really bring it up a lot,  but, I mean, this is a big story today  with the Kris Jenner implant story.  Oh, do they love those black guys?  Jesus.  Why not?  They're not white?  Are they not?  Not really.  I thought they were kind of whitish.  They're Armenian.  They're Armenian.  Yeah.  That's, you know...  I think you have to...  I don't think you write down white on the application  if you're Armenian.  Do you?  I don't know.  What color are you right for that?  Robert Kardashian was considered white. 
[00:21:30]  I wouldn't think he was a black guy.  Yeah.  Armenians, no...  No, I'm not saying they're black,  but what is that?  Is that just white, too?  My friend Nancy was Armenian.  I think there's too many people  that could check off white,  is what I'm saying.  Should we be talking about this?  Aren't they Middle Eastern,  or am I totally nuts?  Yeah.  Armenian?  I thought they were,  or is that my way off?  I wouldn't say white, though,  but I might be wrong.  Look, man, he...  Yeah.  She's sexy, Kim Kardashian.  I mean, she is sexy.  He had some fucking hot daughters,  that's for sure.  Yeah.  He had good cum. 
[00:22:00]  That Kris Jenner has good fucking eggs.  Makes supermodels.  Yeah.  Because she then had two girls  with the Bruce Jenner guy there,  and one of them's already a model,  and the other one's funny looking.  Funny looking.  Sort of.  The one is absolutely model material,  and the other one is just short,  and that's got to drive her fucking nuts.  And then, of course,  Khloe has another father,  in my humble opinion.  Who's Khloe's father at this point, Sam?  It popped up yesterday,  or two days ago again, 
[00:22:30]  that they keep hinting that it's O.J.  O.J.?  Oh, God.  I don't know about that.  And then the Kardashians once again  had to say,  it's not O.J.  O.J.  But why doesn't Kris Jenner tell everyone  who the fuck she fucked  and got pregnant with Khloe?  I do think it's probably Bruce Jenner.  You think it's Bruce Jenner?  Yeah, like she was having an affair with him  or something.  Oh, yeah?  It definitely was not Robert Kardashian.  There's no way.  Could you show the picture again?  I love this.  The family photo.  Yeah, the family photo.  You got everyone all sort of petite, 
[00:23:00]  and then you got this monster.  The bruiser.  She's a monster.  Yeah.  Why do you think she's cute in the face?  Because, you know,  look, she's a monster.  How is that fucking possible?  Ten feet taller than the other ones.  Dude, I'm one of five boys in my family.  We're all within a half an inch of each other.  She doesn't even look in the face  like the other ones at all.  Of course not.  But they keep saying that, you know,  they all have the same father.  It's just bullshit.  She looks kind of like Bruce Jenner, though.  Yes.  What a body on Khloe, though, man.  She has a big, juicy ass. 
[00:23:30]  She's sexy, man.  She is hot.  Oh, fuck.  She's sexy.  She's got some big parts, man.  Yeah, but you could be smothered by that,  like big legs wrapping around you,  just milk and cum.  Give me it.  Give me it.  My favorite is the stupid Courtney Broad,  who has absolutely no personality  and lets her stupid boyfriend  do whatever the fuck he wants,  and she's just a dummy.  That drunk.  Huh?  Yeah.  I bet they have giant bushes  if they don't fucking shave it down. 
[00:24:00]  They just have that black, black hair.  Well, you've got to assume  that their arms would be very hairy.  Yeah, I bet they fucking wax everything.  I think they've got to pretty much wax every day.  Yeah.  They've got, like, a schedule.  They're like an oldie-time candle.  They've got to be dipped  completely in wax  and then just peel it off.  I can't imagine Armenian women are not hairy.  Big, hairy fucking muffins.  And there's a lot of upkeep there.  They probably do full-body electrolysis.  I guarantee they all have unibrows. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, for sure.  The Kardashians would have unibrows.  You know that, right?  They think Khloe would look like with a unibrow.  Well, she might not have the unibrow  because she might have the different father.  That's right.  I guess we still have to say might,  even though, look,  she's a foot taller than her sisters.  Her sisters look very much alike.  Like the other two.  Right.  But she doesn't look like them.  No.  Are they waiting to tell the world  who her father is?  They've got to have a season eight, right?  Oh, God.  I mean, they're smart. 
[00:25:00]  They know how to market themselves.  They give them that much.  What happened with the lawsuit  from the Chris Humphreys?  He ain't letting it go.  He feels like a dick.  He is a dick.  He's an idiot.  He just feels like a complete tool.  But he's not allowing them  just to sneak out of it.  Nope.  Nope.  It's looking more and more  like she just fucking  faked the whole thing  just so she could have  a nice little wedding  for their dumb TV show.  But he genuinely didn't know that.  He had no idea.  He's just a dummy. 
[00:25:30]  Dummy.  That's an old picture of the family.  Oh, man.  But Chloe looks more like  the young sisters  than she does look like  Kim and Courtney.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those are Bruce Jenner's kids, right?  Yeah.  I thought we were going to get  Bruce Jenner on the show.  He came in here  and didn't do the show, though.  Who did he do?  He did the mash-up.  He did a few shows.  He did a mash-up?  He did a bunch of shows.  When was he on?  He was promoting the Olympics.  Did you see him?  I did not see him.  But he was definitely in here.  He was a hero growing up.  Yeah.  Why didn't we get him? 
[00:26:00]  I think...  Probably because we beat  the shit out of his family.  I think it was...  Nah.  Come on.  I don't think it gets back to that.  Everybody does.  It might get back to the publicist.  Yeah.  I think the publicist  had a lot of control  over what shows they were doing.  They wanted to make sure  everything was, you know...  On the up and up.  On the up and up.  Yeah.  We probably would have been all right.  Bruce Jenner was on a Wheaties box  and his family doesn't give a fuck.  No.  His family doesn't give a fuck  that this guy was a national hero.  Steal his credit card  and he's like,  you can't do that.  They're like,  okay, fuck you, dad, whatever.  Right.  What are the assholes? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I guess on the latest episode,  Kris Jenner opened up her closet  and someone was telling me  that there's bags,  like those fucking women's bags  in her closet,  like hundreds of thousands  of dollars per bag  and she had like a bunch of them.  She could have had a million dollars  worth of bags  just in that fucking closet.  Who, Kris Jenner?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did they get their money?  What was the...  Where did this show...  Kardashian's money come from  Robert Kardashian.  This show...  They started, Rich, right?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, they always had money.  I don't know.  I guess he did well as a lawyer. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, he was all well.  Yeah, I mean, he was OJ's lawyer.  OJ had to pay a pretty penny.  Well, thanks, Aunt Sam.  A pretty penny.  But it was...  Was he OJ's lawyer or a friend?  He was his friend.  I don't know if he was his lawyer.  Was he?  He got involved with the whole thing.  No, personally,  I think he hid the murder weapon.  I think he helped him.  They all knew each other  out there in Hollywood.  So when you get in trouble,  you're like,  all right, fuck,  who can we call?  Oh, Rob.  Rob, what do you got?  You hear about Chris Darden.  He's not letting it go. 
[00:27:30]  Really?  It came out a couple days ago.  He goes...  He's saying that...  What's his name?  Who was the lead fucking guy?  Cochran.  Johnny Cochran.  And the other guy.  Oh, Barry Sheck?  And the other guy.  No, Shapiro.  F. Lee Bailey?  Robert Shapiro?  Shapiro.  Shapiro.  And the rest of them,  they had the glove during lunch,  and they ripped the lining inside  to make it...  You ever try to put a glove on  that has all fucked up lining?  You don't...  It gets like...  Oh, yeah.  You can't push the lining  into the fingers and stuff.  Chris Darden is saying now, 
[00:28:00]  many years later,  it came out only a couple days ago,  maybe you can find the article,  that they tampered with the glove  during lunch,  and that's why OJ couldn't put it on.  Because he's like,  that fucking glove fit.  But he also had...  OJ also had a rubber glove  all over his hand.  Right.  That's the mistake the lawyers made.  They should have said,  look, maybe it's not fitting  because he has that plastic bag  or whatever the fuck on his hand.  They didn't say any of that.  They just sat there in shock  that it wasn't fitting.  The mistake they made,  and this is why Darden  should just shut his face, 
[00:28:30]  there was no reason  to have OJ put that glove on.  It was a blunder.  Yeah.  Marsha Clark said she wanted  to strangle him when he did it.  Right.  It was, I think,  an improv moment  that he fucked up.  They wanted to go for that moment,  like, see?  Yep.  And then they blew it.  They gave that jury the out that they...  That jury did not want to convict him.  Right.  And they said,  this is the glove that did it.  Put it on, OJ.  Right.  It doesn't fit.  Yeah, they wanted to find him innocent,  but they knew they needed something.  And then when the glove doesn't fit... 
[00:29:00]  Look at those...  Look at the gloves he wore under the glove.  How would you get a glove on?  And those are those form-fitting gloves  that we all get every once in a while  for Christmas and throw away.  Isotoners?  I fucking hate those gloves.  I always throw them away.  Those are the gift gloves, yeah.  And I throw them away.  That's how I'm going,  who wants these?  I throw them away.  They're form-fitting gloves,  so how do you not know that as the lawyer?  And then it doesn't fit,  and you go,  well, maybe it's because he has those other...  What are those called, anyway?  Those are like safety or...  Those safety gloves.  Germ gloves that he used in the deli. 
[00:29:30]  Surgical.  So why would you go to the judge  and go,  hey, we got an issue here.  I don't know if it's fitting  because of these safety gloves.  They tried to explain it away  over the next couple days.  They presented evidence  that showed that the blood  that had been on it or whatever  had shrunk it  because of the liquid dried or something.  But they just...  The typical L.A. prosecutor fashion,  they stink.  Right.  And that's why they blew that big case.  And O.J. never tried the glove on beforehand, right?  Chris Darden just assumed that...  Yeah.  We know he's guilty,  and we know this is his glove,  so it's going to fit. 
[00:30:00]  But if you were going to commit a murder  and you needed gloves or something,  why would you get gloves that don't fit?  Why would you get, like,  all your clothes perfect?  You should get everything that doesn't fit.  If I was going to go down that road,  I would get much bigger shoes.  I would get maybe tight gloves.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Why is that a guarantee  that someone did it?  Because, oh, their shoe size is 10  and the footprint is a 10.  I'd wear 12s.  Or better yet,  like even smaller ones.  It kind of hurt for a little while,  but it's like, 
[00:30:30]  a guy can't even wear these.  They don't fit.  Fuck.  If you're willing to fucking murder people,  you can figure some shit out.  I never understood that.  No.  Maybe O.J. is like,  yeah, I'm going to murder some people.  I'm going to need some gloves,  so I'm going to go and get some gloves  that are, you know,  a size too small.  I'm going to murder some people.  Well, you know what I mean?  Excuse me.  I'm going to murder some people.  I need gloves.  Why would you go to, like,  Macy's and get everything  in your perfect size  if you're going for your murder clothes?  If you're going for murder clothes, 
[00:31:00]  you're fucking,  if you wear a 32,  you get 36-inch pants.  My ugly ass Bruno Mali shoe.  Right.  Right.  You think O.J. wakes up  every day in jail  and goes,  what a dumb motherfucker I am.  I beat murder  over two people  and I went to jail  over sports stuff.  He beat a double murder.  All he had to do  was keep his fucking...  Keep...  Lay low.  Lay low.  Thank you, Jay.  Lay low for the rest  of your dumb life  and shut your face.  What an idiot.  He just couldn't help himself.  You got that clip 
[00:31:30]  of Chris Darden?  This was big a couple days ago.  Yeah.  I might have hit over the weekend.  We're not going back in time.  This literally just popped up  a couple days ago.  This would be like  a whole new story.  Well, that's fine.  This is Garage.  Oh.  It doesn't sound like him.  I hate commercials.  This is the Nissan  Innovation Garage.  It's your chance  to share your innovation idea  and win a $50,000 grant  to help make it happen.

They just gave a free commercial.  You know what happened  17 years ago?  A moment in American legal history  that few of us  who watch this  will ever forget.  Here's a flashback for you.  Flashback.  We the jury  in the above entitled action  find the defendant  Boris Johnson  not guilty of the crime of murder  in violation of penal code  section 187 
[00:32:30]  a felony upon Nicole Brown  He doesn't want to look at him.  I know exactly where I was  when I heard that.  The trial of the century  and the most controversial ever.  Rob Kardashian  doesn't want to look at him  because he's like  fuck,  I gotta support my friend  even though I know  he murdered people  so I'll just be here  to support him  and then he's like  disgusted.  And then you can't even  see him though  in this clip.  Right.  That's the MSNBC?  They put a stupid ad  at the bottom.  But then he's disgusted.  He's like holy fuck  he got away with murder. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to be part of this.  And who wrote that  to support my friend  through this tough time?  Who wrote the book  O.J. Didn't Do It?  Well from what book  was that?  I don't know.  That's the little thing up there  is this book  O.J. Didn't Do It?  I don't know.  I continue.  I'm sorry.  O.J. wrote this.  Former football superstar  and actor O.J. Simpson  found not guilty  of killing his wife  Nicole Brown Simpson  and Ronald Goldman  to this day.  Skeptics question that verdict  and many suggest  that O.J. Simpson  got away with murder.  My next guest  does not believe  that is the case  and he's written  a book about it  called O.J. is Innocent 
[00:33:30]  and I Can Prove It.  Private investigator  and author  William Deere  joins me now.  I want to hear  an controversial book  that you have spent  17 years  putting together  personally investigating  this case.  So what drove you  to dedicate  that much time  to trying to find out  an answer  that none of us know?  Well first of all  it was kind of  started off as  I would check it out  because of what  my son had said.  I was speaking  from the International  Council of Investigators  Reporters and Editors  during the so-called  carj scene  and I made the statement 
[00:34:00]  it's just something  concocted by O.J.'s lawyers  to get him off.  My son said  Dad you're assuming  he's guilty  and I've always taught  homicide  saying never assume  and always verify.  So that was the beginning  of my 17 year journey.  I flew out  climbed over the back gate  two weeks after it happened  walked that walkway  sat at her front door  and then looking at it  I was a little bit  intuitive they said  but I also felt  there was not a lot  of evidence  of what was being printed  in the paper  compared to what  I was seeing  first hand.  Now I realize 
[00:34:30]  17 years later  I was wrong  when I made  that original statement.  I stand with the position  now that O.J.  was at the crime scene  but after the murders  and he's been protecting  someone all along  we have  what we believe  right here  is the murder weapon  experts have examined it  it marking on the top  of this hilt  is certainly fitting  you couldn't see it  wait wait Mr. Deer  hold that up  you say this is  the murder weapon  we believe that  this is in fact  the murder weapon  it's a Gerber  replica of a Gerber  Mark 1  double bladed knife 
[00:35:00]  if you'll notice  at the top Thomas  the part has been removed  wax has been poured in  but when it was compared  to the laceration  on the top  of Nicole's skull  it fit perfectly  three top experts  one particular one  who designed  and wrote the book  on knife and gunshot wounds  Dr. Vincent DeMaio feels  in all probability  what I'm showing you  here today  is the murder weapon  Mr. Deer  why isn't this  in the hands of police  why haven't you  turned over  what you believe  to be material evidence  that you say  because I'm insane  corroborated  by people  experts in the field 
[00:35:30]  why isn't this  in the hands of police  to reopen an investigation  and where did you get it  well it was put  into a stories facility  and that stories facility  was also these diaries  that belongs to  can you move the fucking  not you Sam  pause real quick  this MS  all these networks  fucking stink  they just have  these little  these lazy fucking  banners  and he's holding up  things for the murder  and you can't see them  because it's being  covered by these  banner things  that they're putting  at the bottom  these people should  just be shot 
[00:36:00]  to run television  terrible  we live in a world  of banners  but you're right  they're lazy  because if they  want banners  on all their video  they can move  the banners around  so they don't  disrupt what's  going on  on the screen  it's terrible  that means you need  someone fucking  on the switch  you found it  in a storage facility  why would you  put it in a storage facility  or  this aired like this  on MSNBC  now it's on their  website  then you're fucking  making a different version  so you move the  banners around 
[00:36:30]  so you can see shit  lazy fucking  they should have  a guy whose job  it is  when he's watching  drop the banner  go to the shot  immediately  there should be  one clean camera  shot  that has nothing  in front of it  then they go six  and all of a sudden  it's on six  and the banner  is gone  what if it's five  Jimmy  that's the beauty  of it  then you can come  back on and go  we're sorry  he yelled five  Bill get out here  Bill hits six  then Bill can go  my mother's cunt  then  we're looking at 
[00:37:00]  MSNBC right now  it says  morning Joe  you need the name  of the show  on the screen  constantly  no  then it says  live  we don't need  that  then it gives  the time  we don't need  that  we don't need  the day  it says  September 12th  then it has  the MSNBC logo  that's just on  the top of the screen  then the bottom  it has  must read  op-eds  do you really  need that  a big huge  font  and then it  says the  Wall Street Journal  and it has  some article  they want you  to read  that just  went away  and then they  have the ticker  below that 
[00:37:30]  like half that  shit  you don't need  that stock ticker  and health  it's just  movement  constant movement  constant  left right  right left  banner  banner sign  words  we don't need it  TV's trying to  keep up  but they just  don't know  how to do it  I mean  you know  if you're a stock  guy and need  the ticker  you're not  watching it on TV  you got it  on your fucking phone  or you go to  CNBC or whatever  that actually  does that shit  for you know  for their  programming  you don't need  no one's fucking 
[00:38:00]  concentrating on  their stocks  I would love to  know the numbers  of people  the amount of  people I should  say that sit  there and go  no I tune in  MSNBC because  I got to see  that stock  ticker  at the bottom  that number  is ridiculously  low  it says top  stories  Justin Bieber  with Seacrest  if you're  listening to a  guy talk  why the fuck  do you have  to read  something on  the bottom  why don't  they just  let you  watch the  guy you're  watching  basically  they don't  have confidence  in their own  programming  so basically  they want  you to have  something else  to watch  if you're not  into the story  I get that  part 
[00:38:30]  and that's  tiny  that's a tiny  scroll at the  bottom  top stories  but the rest  of it I think  you could pretty  much get rid  of  it's terrible  it's worthless  as is Donnie  Deutsch  I just got  out of bed  I'm just  casual  my casual  clothes were  on the floor  my iced  coffee  but he looks  he literally  looks like  he's watching  somebody's shit  on the side  of the road  the look  on his  face  I've never  seen a more  uncomfortable  face  on TV  that's  jesus  shit 
[00:39:00]  on the side  I tapped  out of this  clip by the way  what's going on  this guy  I tapped  it off  who is this guy  I'm going to guess  he's saying  OJ's son  he's just  a private  investigator  but I'm going to  guess he's  a total guess  but I would guess  OJ's son if he's  going to try to  explain away  evidence  that is a weird  case if you think  about it  it's really strange  because then the  son goes away  you never hear  from him again  it's almost like  he's a little  smarter than his  dad  let's say his  son did it  he's a little  smarter than his  dad  he's like 
[00:39:30]  holy fuck  I can't believe  this  and he decided  to diss a  fucking peer  you don't know  much about him  no you haven't  heard from him  nope  some would say  he did it  some would say  maybe  he helped  he just  knows to shut  his mouth  he wasn't that  young at that  point right  he was pretty  young when  he was pretty  fucking young  when that murder  happened  wasn't he  to think he  cut his own  mother's  because the  FBI profile  is always  talking about  how personal  a crime that  was  throat cutting  that's a rough 
[00:40:00]  one  yeah  I don't believe  the son did  that  why would you  be so angry  I mean  unless  OJ did it  unless you look  at your mother  fucking this guy  Ron Goldman  who I think  she was fucking  him  unless you see  that and go  I hate this  guy for fucking  my father's wife  or my mom  for doing this  to my dad  but that's an  angry fucking  possessive man  thing to do  stab a guy  and in OJ's  book  if I did  if I did  he said  something about  how the guy  the guy tried  would have tried  jujitsu on him  or whatever  and I believe 
[00:40:30]  that that's what  happened  he was  that was to me  he told you  what happened  if I did it  why would you  why  because he's OJ  man  he can't  he can't  fucking deal  with no  attention  you want it  bad  whatever  you want to  see the rest  of the clip  we see another  minute  I'm just curious  to where he's  going with this  found at the  crime scene  we have attempted  on more than one  occasion  as you'll see  in the book  everything is  documented  in this book  522 pages  but everything  that we're saying  has in fact  been documented  and we attempted  to meet with them  on a number of  occasions  and they refused 
[00:41:00]  you keep saying  him  who is the  who is the  suspect  and who  did you  go after  in terms of  the evidence  who are you  going after  OJ's son  Jason Lamar Simpson  who was 24 at the time  511-235  in Thomas  he was on  probation at the time  for assaulting his  previous employee  with a knife  had checked in  the Cedar Sinai  hospital  just weeks prior  to the murder  saying he was out  of his depakote  to control his rage  never ever interviewed  by the Los Angeles  Police Department  Mr. Deere 
[00:41:30]  he was never named  a suspect  from the beginning  we have reached out  to Jason  for a comment  his phone  is not activated  right now  what makes you  so sure  that you're not  going to be facing  some major lawsuits  for defamation  out of all of this  because of the fact  that everything  I have is documented  we have his diaries  we have what we believe  to be the murder weapon  we have the evidence  in the hair  we have him wearing  that knit cap  and the fact  that the socks  that were in  foot of OJ's bed  explain to everybody  Mr. Deere 
[00:42:00]  how did you get  all of this material  and are you willing  to turn it over  to police  oh I've been willing  for a long period  of time  we met with  the attorney general  about three years ago  his staff  who were elated  over what we had  uncovered  and for some  unknown reason  it certainly  in other words  they asked us  hold all this  for several weeks  we're going to  get back with you  we're excited  don't get in touch  with LAPD  we'll help you  but then about  five weeks later  we received a letter  that said  case closed  not interested  he's a crackpot  I think this guy's 
[00:42:30]  a crackpot  how did you get  Jason's private property  it was put into  a public storage  here in Los Angeles  he failed to make  the payments  an individual  bought it  contacted us  we purchased it  and as a result  we have that information  including  the vehicle  our suspect  was driving  on the night  of June 12th  private investigator  what do we got here  it's a lamp  this ain't gonna bring  anything  we got  some mattresses  hey there's a box  here  it's the OJ  murder knife  let me take this  down  I'm gonna have  to see how much  this is worth 
[00:43:00]  no there's a box  here it says  OJSMW  on it  wow  yep  wow  but I mean  if you're a murderer  and you've got a  storage locker  why the fuck  would you not  keep your payments  up  and if you can't  keep your payments  up  why would you  fucking get rid  of some shit  that's a big one  on storage wars  before they go to  commercial  what do we got  oh man  and then they go  to commercial  they come back  it's OJ's knife  this is great  well it doesn't  sound crazy  but then again  those are the ones  you gotta worry about 
[00:43:30]  yeah  what's his background  who is this guy  he's just a private  investigator  yeah  he's just a granddad  I like the questions  the guys ask him  how did you get  this stuff  and he's got good  answers but they're  vague enough  yeah  they're vague  they are a bit  not too  it's like Iraq  yeah  quite that vague  did you see the  murder weapon  but why wouldn't he  bring um  some proof  on the air  with him  he brought the knife  brought the knife  you couldn't see it  because it was  behind the banner  that was yeah  and then allegedly  brought the diaries  yes  we didn't see them  well the diaries  would be important 
[00:44:00]  see this  he used to own  this storage locker  see now we own it  right  shit like that  it would have to be  the son  only because  if you're making  a case  it was someone else  there's undeniable  DNA evidence  it would have to be  a family member  because that's the  only other person  that might be able  to justify that DNA  right  OJ's murder knife  you know  it's gonna sit in my  shop for a while  and you know  what  in essence  it's just a knife  there are plenty  of knives out there  but this is OJ's  knife  30 bucks 
[00:44:30]  30 bucks  you know  I was hoping  for 10,000  but I got 30  I guess I'm gonna  take my wife  out to dinner  those wives  love dinner  they love dinner  in Vegas  love it  we were hoping  for the Chris Darden  clip  so that had  nothing to do  with Chris Darden  I don't know why  they associated  that clip  with the story  but I mean  Chris Darden  said it  at a panel  discussion  at PACE  do you think  Chris Darden  just fucking  cannot sleep  at night 
[00:45:00]  still  because of  that fucking  trial  it just  pokes at him  because he knows  he blew it  yes  he broke down  and cried  in the fucking  press  can you find  the press  conference  Chris Darden  just put  Chris Darden  blubbering  that was his  whole career  who the fuck  would hire him  that was the  fucking  world series  super bowl  everything  and he blew it  him and that  fucking dumb bitch  they were out of  their league  man  Marcia Clark  Chris Darden  who else was on  Marcia Clark's side  you're forgetting  Marcia  well I'll tell you  one of the guys  who I met  he came to the 
[00:45:30]  comedy cellar  one night  one of the  original prosecutors  I forget his name  but I got a picture  with him  and an autograph  and when he  signed his autograph  you know  dear Jim  he did it  and then signed  his name  oh wow  was it Gil  something  I'll know it  as soon as I  fucking hear  the original  OJ prosecutor  but he had to  drop out  because I think  he had a heart  issue  he had something  with his health  well  Chris Darden  oh boy  and he's an  older guy  and I think  well he's still  around  I think he's 
[00:46:00]  alive  but I'm wondering  did he have to  drop off that  case  or did LA  in a miscalculation  think it would  look better  to have a woman  and a black guy  prosecuting him  and an older  white guy  yes  I'm sure  oh you're probably  right  they so played  it that way  and then he has  to come up  with a reason  why he's  gotta drop out  it's all bullshit  Darden was terrible  everything we know  is just bullshit  Darden came off  as a fucking  wimp  like you had  the dream team  there just  banging out shit  god damn 
[00:46:30]  they had that  genetics guy  fucking  what's his name  you just mentioned  him before  Barry  Barry Sheck  Barry  fucking  Shapiro  and  Cochran  all those  motherfuckers  were brilliant  I think Cochran  was undefeated  by the LA  prosecutors  he was  as much as  I hated  the thing  he took  he was an  amazing lawyer  he was a  brilliant guy  he didn't lose  until all  pudding  took to his  brain  yeah  when it was  him versus  fucking  a fucking  a rock 
[00:47:00]  on the brain  he took  one in the  L column  Darden  just was  dumb  big  bubble head  Jesus  is this  where he  cries  I don't  think so  what  you gotta  go to  OJ  go to  Darden  cries  press  conference  how about  Chris  Darden  Marsha  Clark  press  conference  after  loss  yeah 
[00:47:30]  I hate  my acid  reflux  oh what's  the matter  is it  refluxing  you remember  when he  broke down  and cried  yeah I do  that should  be up  that should  be on the  internet  somewhere  did he  have two  bad knees  what happened  well  he might  18 years  ago  I left  Dane  Ohio  with two  very bad  knees  yeah  something  happened  I can't 
[00:48:00]  remember  I thank  god  the dream  came true  the dream  came true  you fucking  weepy  pissy eyed  bastard  Jesus  Christ  is this  it  no  no  no  oh  Sam  I don't  want to  blame you  but I  have to  because  you're  inept  when it  comes to  searching  for things  we'll  take a  break  we'll  try to  find  that  club  we're  going to  eat  god damn it  what's this guy's name  it's going to drive me  or Sam would say  bonkers  bonkers  oh my god 
[00:48:30]  and I finally  thanks to  C-Men  singer on twitter  Garcetti  oh yeah  yeah yeah  Gil Garcetti  Gil Garcetti  yeah very good  that's it  no it's not me  it's T-V-O-N-A-T-L  thank you  I want to  thank  C-Men  singer  after the  break  it was  something I  referred to  a few  days ago  and he  helped me  find it  when will  we forget  hmm  it's called  when will  we forget  and  I want to 
[00:49:00]  know the  stuff we  already  forgot  because  this list  starts at  2012  basically  they figured  out a formula  where there'll  be more  people that  don't remember  living through  an event  than do  I'll give  you the  first one  this year  2012  there are  people  don't have  a memory  of living  in the  70s  as a majority  as a majority  there's more  people who  don't remember  the 70s  yes  in the year  2012  I thought  this was  fascinating  there's a  whole bunch  of others  but I want 
[00:49:30]  the ones  before 2012  what have  we forgotten  already  as a majority  meaning more  people don't  know something  we'll do it  after the break  it'll be  something  what's going  to happen  in the year  2525  in the year  25  if man is  still alive  whoever owns  a hat store  that says  25 in a  circle  will be  a millionaire  we're going  to need  the help  of the  listeners  we got  eight minutes  find the  list that  starts before  2012  for me  please 
[00:50:00]  because we  got  the list  I got  starts in  2012  when will  we forget  key things  that happened  in our  society  society  I want  a list  of the  stuff  that  is  already  long  gone  as far  as the  majority  goes  out  there  all right  and other  things  stay there  Sirius XM  this is the  only in  at three  show  I hear the  train  coming  it's rolling  around the  bend  and I  ain't seen  the sunshine  since I  don't know 
[00:50:30]  when I'm  stuck in  fulsome prison  and time  keeps dragging  on  nine years  ago today  lost Johnny  Cash  he's even  dead nine  years  yeah  wow  how about  that  I remember  me in  Florentine  going to  the airport  listening to  some Johnny  Cash  talking about  how he had  just died  I can't 
[00:51:00]  believe it's  almost a  decade ago  nine years  and he  would only  be about  80  right around  80 I  believe  right after  June  Carter  man  so that's  about  ten years  ago  with that  controversy  with MTV  where they  wouldn't give  him the  fucking  he was up  for the  best video  and  Justin  Timberlake  got it  and Justin  Timberlake  for what  Cry Me  a River  didn't he  know  that's  nine or  ten years  old now  holy  fuck  didn't he  say something  about how  Johnny Cash  should have  won  of course  everyone  what did  he say  that hurt 
[00:51:30]  video was  the best  video of  the year  by far  but stupid  MTV  well you know  Justin Timberlake  is way more  popular right  now and he  could be at  the awards  Johnny Cash  is sick  somewhere  so we  better do  this  bunch of  idiots  that's one  thing I  hate about  younger  people  it's like  the people  that don't  tribute guys  like that  like I'll  talk to  people now  and they  have no  idea about  certain  movies  I know  I sound  like an  old  man  but when  I was  18  I had  seen  Clockwork  Orange  which came  out when  I was  three  so if  I saw 
[00:52:00]  Dr. Strangelove  I saw  fucking  on the  waterfront  which was  maybe  before I  was born  all these  people that  have no  knowledge of  what came  before them  are just  dopes  Timberlake  acknowledged  it  he's like  this is  stupid  he said  it's a  travesty  it was in  2003  I demand  a recount  Timberlake  saying this  demanding a  recount  he won  basically saying  I demand  that you  show that  I lost  this  he said  it's an  honor to be  in a category  with people  like Eminem  and 50 Cent  and people  that I  admire  John Mayer  as well 
[00:52:30]  but also  my grandfather  raised me  on Johnny Cash  I'm from  Tennessee  and I think  he deserves  this more  than any  of us  here tonight  of course  I remember  that like  it was  yesterday  I'm so stupid  and I think  the crowd  started booing  they cheered  they cheered  says here  they cheered  no I mean  they started  booing  when it was  announced  that Johnny Cash  didn't win  that hurt  video is ridiculous  it was awesome  you might not  like the song  or whatever  or his version  but I mean  come on  you gotta love  that  that's a good  tune  Johnny Cash 
[00:53:00]  it just doesn't  do anything  for me  this is not  your guy  I love Johnny Cash  Jimmy turned me  on to deep  I don't mind  old Johnny Cash  but this shit  was a little  too like  what a sad  video  they picked  the picture  of his mother  on the wall  and then his wife  standing there  on the steps  just looking at him  they were trying  to make it all  fucking weird  like that  and it worked  yeah it worked  terrible  but he was  old for something  but it worked  with him  because he was  an old guy  that really  had that  fucking  that spirit 
[00:53:30]  like when you  watch those  clips of his  old fucking  videos  like what a  brilliant  theme to put  to this  like you know  because Kat  this didn't feel  country-ish  he's a country  star  well I mean  he became a  crossover  because he  started taking  these you know  rock songs  and making  them his own  like what a  great environment  and his fucking  the old footage  showing him so  young and full  of life  and this  this  that's what I  want to see  look at the  museum 
[00:54:00]  I'm singing  I fell into  a burning  ring of fire  that's what I  want to hear  and you can  remember that  too  thanks to  YouTube  thanks to  the internet  look at him  all young  on a train  like look at him  walking around  all handsome  hi I'm Johnny  and they put in  that one audio  clip from him  here which was  so great  yeah they show  him all young  and then they show  him looking like  he has radiation  poisoning  but that's the  beauty of this  no it's not  he's at the end  of his life  yeah man  it's gonna happen  to all of us  and it's choreographed 
[00:54:30]  beautifully  yeah  perfectly choreographed  look at the  museum  someone said  fuck this place  look at it  yeah  gift shop has  nothing  there's a broken  record on the  floor  so well  you think they  set up some  of those shots  or that's how  the museum was  wait  oh we're not  listening to the  video  oh  yeah  Iraq's got it  we probably  should have went  with the video  yeah you stay  in the hell  I switched over  wow  full of broken  thoughts 
[00:55:00]  after a stroke  yeah and he  can still sing  I cannot  repair  beneath the  stain  he's gonna do  his old house  yawn  yawn  come on  see  look at him  disappear  you're picking a leaf  off the tree  you are someone  else  I am still  right here  Jesus  I just got chills  on that line  what have I 
[00:55:30]  become  my sweetest friend  you know she died  right after this  she died a month  after this was done  I think  two months after  she couldn't take it  anymore  enough of him  ice  great spread of food  that's why  aunt hates this video  cause he's dumping  out wine  we stole  codger  the old coot 
[00:56:00]  I will let you down  but it's just so well  fucking shot  I will make you hurt  if I could  break through fire  of Columbo  one of my favorite  Columbo's  was the one he was in  that's an awesome pilot  the fucking  the crucifixion  being dumped in  in a temple building  this is phenomenal  I would find  a way 
[00:56:30]  who made this video  I don't know  I don't know who directed  it  it's really smart  same guy that did  oh Mickey  you're so fine  it's the best video  I've ever seen  now there's a line in there  everything goes away  in the end right  yeah  and that it leads  to this thing  I've been talking about  for a couple days  and we finally found it  a thing  when will we forget shit  cause in the end  you'll just  you know  there's stuff that  happened a hundred years ago  no one even gives a fuck  about or obviously  remembers  there was an old  dessert place  in my neighborhood  it was famous 
[00:57:00]  cause John and Yoko  used to go there  it was around the  corner from the  Dakota  and they would go there  for some cappuccinos  and some dessert  every day  and they had a table  that supposedly  they sat at  that they kind of  kept forever  and they tried to keep  this little joint  in the neighborhood  but then of course  the rent went up  too high  and they turned  into a hardware store  is it deserted  well they turned  into a hardware store  and then the stupid  hardware store  is not doing well  so they're going to  put something else  in there  but Beatles fans 
[00:57:30]  know this place  and if they're  in New York  they go there  to check it out  this is where  John went a lot  with Yoko  right  anyway  my point being  on the walls  they used to have  all these opera stars  and all these stars  from back in the day  I didn't know  one fucking person  on the wall  but you know  there was a time  if you walked  into that place  and all these opera stars  I think it was  mostly opera stars  were on the walls  people would be like  holy fuck  look at all these  famous big people  you know  don't you like  I like looking  at people like that 
[00:58:00]  it's fascinating  because you don't know them  because from another  you know time  these people  were really famous  and now here  I'm just a Joe  Joe Dick  walking into this place  and I don't know  any of these people  I love looking at that  because time has  you know  moved on  yeah  unless they're like  you walk into  one of those places  and half the actors  you know  and half of them  you don't  but you know  there's a painting  of them  I forget the name  of the place  that has all these  paintings on the wall  in the city  I think it would be  a little different  because now  with technology  and stuff 
[00:58:30]  I mean  these people  that used to be famous  there's not much  of their recordings  or anything left  or even pictures  or their performances  because I think  some of them  were in the arts  do you ever go  to that place  that has  like these pipes  it's all pipes  they have hundreds  of thousands  of pipes  and Sam  you might want  to look this up  I don't know  what it is  the plumbing's warehouse  why the fuck  do I follow that  take us out  you fucking 
[00:59:00]  snorting monster  I forget the name  of it  but they have  pipes that go  way back  and guys would  sign them  when you look  back at  some of the names  it was like  I don't know  who these people are  but you know  they're celebrities  pipe smokers  yeah that's what it is  it's a famous  state place  in New York  and they just  had pipes  signed  the ceiling  is lined  with pipes 
[00:59:30]  there's thousands  and thousands  and thousands  of fucking pipes  I've never heard  of this place  it's in New York  yeah Michael K. Williams  Keene's Steakhouse  there you go  Keene's Steakhouse  K-E-E-N-S  Keene's  and look at the ceiling  I don't remember  that's fucked up  so that's similar  to what I'm talking about  it's about the pipes  it's from another era  it really is  we have no connection  to this  you used to be able  to smoke pipes there  and that's where  celebrities would go  and smoke their pipes  and they show  some of the famous 
[01:00:00]  ones that they have  guys that would  leave their shit there  and there was some  like you know  do you have a list  of famous pipes  that were there Sam  it's so wacky  when you watch  like the Twilight Zone  or Alfred Hitchcock  those old shows  to see somebody  light up a pipe  no one smokes  a pipe anymore  it's such a weird thing  it's such a ritualistic  thing to do  I think the hipsters  are bringing back  the pipe  are they  yes they are  I don't consider that  bringing the pipe back  they're doing it  on purpose  they got some mustaches  and they're smoking  a pipe here and there  can you open that picture 
[01:00:30]  hipsters  it's exactly what  I'm looking for Sam  I'll fucking bite you  that's a guy  cutting up a nice  steak there  I know  which I don't want  to see  where the gloves  OJ had on  when he put fucking  they had winter gloves  on  show me the pipes  they wanted him  to put on that  those are oldie pipes  yeah  those are very old  can we zoom in on the  tink tink tink tink tink  you gotta  hit the tobacco out  tink tink tink tink  then you gotta  pack the bowl  what else were you  gonna do with your day  you were bored  so you would spend  an hour just to 
[01:01:00]  smoke a pipe  Will Rogers  give me a goddamn  cup of coffee  thank you  Douglas MacArthur  Will Rogers  see we know  Theodore Roosevelt  Teddy Roosevelt  we know these names  you know what I'm saying  there's plenty  you don't though  and like you know  Dazzy Vance  I know Dazzy  do you  yeah sure  James Gordon  Bennett  I can't see  we can't zoom in  and they're on display  behind a glass case  because I think 
[01:01:30]  someone would want  the Teddy Roosevelt one  yeah  that would be worth  a few bucks  Leo Feinst  John Drew  Stanford White  and then John Barrymore  John Barrymore  but someone said  look  famous  you know  yeah they thought  enough of these people  to sign these pipes  yeah  so anyway  someone came up  with a formula  I don't know  what site design  but it's called  When Will We Forget  unfortunately  where's the Roger Ebert  unfortunately  this starts  in the year 2012  this list would be great 
[01:02:00]  if it started  2000 or something  so we could see  the shit that  most people don't  have a memory  of living through  we could actually  probably do math  because it just  like every year  advances  all they're doing  is taking a big event  from each year  right  so basically  the criteria  is more people  are alive  that don't  remember an event  okay  and in 2012  the year we're  obviously living in  there are more  people living now  that don't have  a memory of the 70s 
[01:02:30]  yeah  of the 70s  in 2030  here's how we do  the math  2030  the OJ Simpson trial  there'll be more  people alive  who don't remember  it than do  or have a memory  of living through it  right  so that's 30 years  it was 1994  so it's a 36 year  split I think  right  now let's go to  Forrest Gump  well 7  2028  it was 1994  that came out  right or no  what year that  came out  right around there  right  yeah I don't think  it's  it's between  35 and 40 years 
[01:03:00]  I see  because the 70s  are obviously  what  that's 20 plus  12  that's 32 years  ago  the late 70s  right right  so I don't know  exactly how  that figures out  but next year  2013  the Carter presidency  people will not  have a memory  of living through  that  next year  the Carter presidency  next year  maybe it changes  every year  maybe it splits  a little bit  because people  are getting older  and older  or staying  living longer  I don't know  well it's too bad 
[01:03:30]  they didn't start  this list  a little earlier  than they did  because that would  be very interesting  for some of the  older folk  the Reagan shooting  2014  more people will be  alive that have  no memory  of living through it  and then you got  the return of the  Jedi release  2016  the first Apple  computer  the first Apple  Macintosh  2017  new coke  it goes on  and on  the Reagan  presidency  by the year  2022  hello 
[01:04:00]  no memory  of living through  it  wow  yeah  is there any  other ones on  this list  that are worth  saying  you said  you said  the OJ  Simpson trial  so by the  year 2030  more people  will be alive  that have no  memory of living  through it  2036 is  9-11  oh yeah  that's  that's  okay  that's how  I wanted  to end this  that's right  because everyone  says you know  never forget  never forget  the problem  is eventually  people will  and that  kind of  sucks  you try to  keep it  alive as long 
[01:04:30]  as possible  but by the  year 2036  more people  will be alive  that have  no memory  of living  through 9-11  2036  that's not  that  that's not  that far away  when you really  think about  the cosmos  well we'll have  flying cars  by then  well sure  we will  mylar suits  we'll all wear  2036  mars bases  2039  there will be  more people  in this country  alive who do  not remember  vh1's  isle of the 90s  and we could be  alive for all  these years 
[01:05:00]  I mean  clinton's  uh  presidency  right  oh clinton's  re-election  where's clinton's  presidency  probably a bunch  of years  after  it was uh  they don't have  they only have  his re-election  and his impeachment  his impeachment  how about his  entangerine  man  new coke  by 2018  more people  have no  people have  no memory  of  good thing  oh because  yeah  I like this  but unfortunately  they should have  started before  2012  yeah 
[01:05:30]  some of the  shit that  you know  people just have  no memory  I've lived  through already  world war  one  oh god  yeah there  you go  ah  the great  war  by 2047  because again  you can see  the years do  change  it says  anything  embarrassing  you do  today  so there will  be more  people alive  in 2047  that have  no memory  of today  than are  alive today  that deserves  wait wait wait  what  in 2047  yeah  there will be 
[01:06:00]  more people  alive  right  who have  no memory  of this  day right  now  wow  than there  are  people alive  now who  do know it  while living it  wow  I guess age  expectancy  that makes  sense  oh yeah  they're probably  figuring that  into it too  yeah that's  why it's not  an exact formula  people living  long and stuff  like that  so  well hold on  I'm 44  it's 2012  so that's 47  that's 35  years  44  54  64  I'll be 79  yeah that makes  sense  I'll be more  than alive here  my dick won't  work as well  I'll be taking

[01:13:00]  he's uh  he's in a cardiac  ICU unit  in montreal as we  speak  vital signs are  getting better  he has a breathing  tube  which they're hoping  to at some point  today remove  it's basically  being used to  help his body  cope with the  trauma that he's  been through  the past 36  hours  fingers are  crossed  prayers for  millions and  millions of  fans around the  world for  this man who's  become just a  pop culture  icon  now let me ask  you I heard 
[01:13:30]  that his heart  had stopped  beating had to  be revived  correct  well I'm not  quite sure  about that  because I was  actually at  ringside when  this happened  I mean we  were calling  the show  we were live  on Monday  night  and I was  looking at  his monitor  and all of a  sudden I  heard a story  and I for a  split moment  thought that it  was part of  the entertainment  I thought that  he was out  can we get  Michael Cole  on the show  and then I  looked over  and I realized  that his head  was on the  table  his arm  started to  shake  and I knew  at that point  that there  was an issue  an issue 
[01:14:00]  I don't know  if it was my  news background  or what it  was but  instinctively  I jumped up  and I hit  my mute  switch  what news  background  that prepared  you  when someone  goes face  to the table  was a problem  he hit a  mute switch  some guy  that can't  talk  or gear  smacked  him in the  head  and he's a  submissive  anti-dominant  he's a mute  switch  fudging the  numbers  security jumped  over the  barricades  about a half  dozen men  carried him  to the side  of the arena  put him on  a stretcher  and they got  him to the  back  and thank  God  he wasn't 
[01:14:30]  just commentating  he was  actually wrestling  he had a match  probably  I don't know  20 minutes  before that  how old  is he?  62 years old  is he too  old to be  doing that?  no I don't  think so  and I'll tell  you why  he passed  all the  physical exams  that were  needed to  participate  number one  number two  Jerry Lawler  he's been  doing this  42 years  he loves it  he's like a  kid  it's all  he's ever  wanted to  do  but more  importantly  than that  he wrestles 
[01:15:00]  100 to  150 times  a year  not just  for us  but for  independent  organizations  around the  world  so I mean  he wants  to do this  he's in  the shape  to do this  and  you know  I don't  think he  Sheryl Crowe got  brain cancer  from Lance Armstrong  resting his  rotten ball  back on her  Jesus  Christ  can we go  back to the  fucking song  Nixon died  in 94  when we

[01:26:30]  fucking  dress  and they're  worried about  the hemline  I continue  what a plunging  next line  my name's Abby  Hensel  and I'm  Brittany  Hensel  we are  22 years  old  people have  been curious  about us  since we  were born  for obvious  reasons  we're identical  twins  who are  a conjoined  you know  it's always  hard to  define people  like  I saw  Roger 
[01:27:00]  which  Roger  you know  how easy  would they  be  I saw  Brittany  and her  sister  who are they  the two  heads  yeah  two heads  one body  oh yeah  two heads  I know  them  can't play  so  that is an  excuse  while  life  has a  conjoined  twin  sometimes  has its  challenges  I like  this  but I don't  need it  we were  raised to  believe  that we  could do  anything  we wanted  we do  we like to  think that  the most  amazing  thing  about us  is  we're just  two heads  we are normal  but I'm  definitely more  normal than  Brett  whatever 
[01:27:30]  anyways  this is the  story of  our normal  regular life  don't say  normal  our normal  conjoined  life  this is our  life  pause  I get  we're all  trying to  up our  game  this is not  normal  you got  two heads  it's not  normal  you have  two heads  just  let's  just  leave it at  that  typical  thing  we learned  the other  day  but  they're not  typical  normal means  you're like  everybody else  I don't see  a lot of  two headed  monsters  walking around  monsters 
[01:28:00]  monsters  it would be a  sideshow  100 years ago  they really  but good for them  they got a good  attitude and all that  but it's just  weird  it's so odd  that's not a clip  by the way  that's a whole show  I thought they said  hottest clips  yeah it's a full episode  yeah we should  could someone  cut up some of this  audio  we'll play a little  bit of it  today  yeah  find a good  episode  maybe the first  episode  fuck it  it's just  weird  yeah  they're doing 
[01:28:30]  a heads  stand  they showed  a clip  of them  driving  would you  get in  a car  with them  man  although  they probably  got great  vision  but when  do they  decide  who's  looking  one could  look at  the road  one could  look at  the blind  spot  one could  text  right  there you  go  no the one  was just  started looking  the other  way  you know  how do you  coordinate that  my turn to  look to the  side  what would  happen  if one of  them  committed 
[01:29:00]  a crime  could they  put the  innocent one  in prison  like yes  really consider  how  why  because no  matter what  you're an  accomplice  they would  just use  the  rico  statutes  where  were you  I was  one inch  to the  left  that's  fucked up  though  because you're  not supposed  to put  an innocent  person  in prison  but 
[01:29:30]  how the  fuck  would you  like  handle  that  case  that  would  be  an  odd  case  right  there  and then  the  one  is  completely  innocent  the  other  one  committed  murder  you have  to  wow  how the  fuck  would  you  do  that  yeah  because  let's  say  she used  her  arm  that she's  in control  with  to stab  somebody  and killed  him  and the  other one  the whole  time was  going no  no  and trying  to pull  her away  and you  got video  saying no  no  yeah  yeah  it's all  said  she was  trying to  stop  her  but the  other  one  killed  somebody  now  what do  you do  because you  can't put  the innocent  one in  prison  right 
[01:30:00]  and that's  weird  and no one  wants to  say this  but obviously  britney  yeah  prettier  no britney's  the problem  in this  oh is she  the problem  abby looks  like she  was supposed  to be  in that  body  not there  britney got  in there  at the  last minute  last minute  her head  is kind  of  look at  the video  yeah you're  right  that's  abby's  body  yeah  if i was  abby i'd be  a little  more pissed  off  she muscled  her way in  there  you could  tell  hit a clip  again  yeah  look at  abby  yeah the  one head  is a  little  i would  assume abby 
[01:30:30]  left to  right  right with  your b-roll  of a college  campus  get to the  freaks  yeah  look you  can tell  that's abby's  body  yeah  the other  head's just  kind of tilted  there  oh man  that is so  weird  she probably  says well  you know  according to  the interloper  we should  um  you've colonized  my body  much like  the british  oh god  that's abby's  body a little  bit more  than the british 
[01:31:00]  i think so  too  yeah  i think  they know  it too  yeah  wouldn't you  be pissed  like wouldn't  you be like  get get out  of my fucking  body  get out  my space  yeah i would  be but also  you have to  look at your  own body  and go like  what a shitty  body like  even if that  is just  your body  you have to  go like  my body  sucks  because it  threw  another head  on here  yeah  what a mistake  they are uh  full of life  though man  this doesn't  bother them at  all i guess  you're just  used to what  you got  that's all  you got  they can't  picture i don't  know how  they sleep  that's the  first thing i'd

[01:41:30]  dropping a little bit  one season i remember the  red sox you know fading out  a bit i mean they were they  were contending for a while  then things fell apart with  jimmy williams and you know  the yankees uh took care of  them pretty good oh yeah  he's losing muscle control  his head's nodding down a  little bit  shoulders are kind of  holding it up yeah  he's propped up on his  shoulder mike is now by his  ear  yeah  have always been you know  pretty good and pretty  meaningful  definitely a lot lower than  when this clip started  yeah  the first time in a long 
[01:42:00]  time you know the only  thing is that they even  see mike and you know  he's a big deal  pitchers lately  two of them in the series  so no matter what the  rest of the team  holy shit  if these pitchers hold  the yankees down  you know you could be  looking at a game where  they might be 3-1 or 4-1  how disoriented  we're talking with  sweeney obviously  obviously not to you  so he obviously was  asleep we gotta explain  the clip  and he 
[01:42:30]  he  he was  his head fell so hard  that it woke him up  he woke up his eyes  and his eyes went  really wide  like that scene from  caddyshack with the  the dude in the rowboat  yeah  and uh  and then went  what the fuck's going on  had no idea where he was  for a split second or two  yeah he was looking around  and then he turned his  mic off to talk to his  producer like where the  fuck am i what's going on  asking who am i talking to  exactly  and then comes back and  says we're obviously  speaking to sweeney  by the way another guy  with a fucking radio show  that is recorded  visually  yeah yeah 
[01:43:00]  so we can watch him  fall asleep  today bob will explain  why all that's not  possible for us though  really  we have a conference call  and that'll be terrific  oh right yes  he'll be explaining  their bullshit to us  well maybe not  maybe there's a  oh really  what is he saying  off mic  i think he's saying  what did i do  did bob say there  was no positives  what did i do  i just fell asleep  i just know how this works  by this point  i thought he said that  yeah  so he's  and he is  and he pops his head up  like what's going on  where am i  what is he saying  what  wow 
[01:43:30]  yeah  he looks like he's coming  out of a blackout in jail  yeah  fuck yeah man  that's a great clip  that'll be uh  viral today huh  he's a good broadcaster  though francis  he really  he knows how to handle  stuff and uh  i gotta say  he's good at what he  does as much as  i think he's an ass  yeah  six hours a day  he fucking talks  a lot about shit  that i would be  he's on six hours a day  they don't need him  for six hours  i think he's on  from like one to seven  or something  why  wow  yeah  fake dog  you could talk 
[01:44:00]  about sports  six hours a day  no  you can't  that's the amazing  part about him  yeah  wow  six hours a day  just doing sports  yeah  i want to have a daughter  and name her  sweeney murty  even though i've never  even though i've never  met sweeney  sweeney  but i want to meet him  someday  and say this is my daughter  her name is sweeney murty  and i named her after you  what an awful name  just have him go  okay  sweeney  imagine being the boyfriend  oh sweeney 
[01:44:30]  yeah  there's something else  in that clip  a lot of people know  this sweeney murty  or whatever the fuck  and they say  he's a bore  he's a dullard  and he doesn't take a breath  when he talks  and he puts everyone  to sleep  there's no room  for interjection  is that what it is  no  so mike francesca  tapped out  i love how his head  just slowly  starts heading  toward the console  and then it was  to the point of  no return  where he wakes him up  like what the fuck  you think his producer  said something  in his head  yes  it looks kind of like that  his head was about to hit 
[01:45:00]  the console  right  that's the way you do it  oh and you can read his lips  was that you  he goes  no i thought it said  who am i talking to  did he say that  go back slightly  he said what are you doing  what are you doing  what are you doing  yeah  what are we doing  what am i doing  what did you say  alright  what  what did i do  or what did you do  oh  what did you do  but his producer  woke him up  what did i do  he's probably like  look at that  cool headphones 
[01:45:30]  hanging down like that  so much easier  he's got those  they're old style  airplane headphones  stethoscope headphones  yeah i don't like those  yeah they don't look  comfortable at all  but they hurt  but it doesn't  flatten out your hair  yeah his hair  he's got a good head of hair  my hair gets flattened out  for pictures  because these headphones  we wear  my princess has got  a great head of hair  all these videos  yeah  of his radio show  it ain't happening  it's not gonna happen  you can't fall asleep  when your show's gonna happen  yeah  what's going on  with our studio  with your studio 
[01:46:00]  i'm sure there's a big  fucking meeting  about what happened  yesterday  i'm just trying to get  an update real fast  oh  about the mic stand  mic stands  and the giant board  in front of me  that doesn't need  to be here anymore  well i tell you this  changes are in the works  oh  like what  what do you mean  what do you mean  i don't know  they've listened to your  complaints  and they'll be  moving forward  okay  nothing's happening  are they gonna get  the mic stands  that eroc picked out  that we saw  in the intro tubes  that we all said 
[01:46:30]  yeah that's pretty much  what we need  yeah  not the erector set  they put in here  yesterday  uh  there's no update  no  there is no actual  no one just  no one gives a fuck  okay  it's amazing  what happened  but he runs the channel  when he get to you guys  and go all right  what's real  what's not  were they exaggerating  in the air  what's going on  get the vibe  we spoke a bit  yeah  and from now on  we're gonna make sure  when equipment needs  to be tested 
[01:47:00]  that some of us  get in there  and get to have  some input  before you guys  step in  so there was another  passing of the buck  ah  let the record show  without naming names  a bunch of people  just fucking nodded  what  more than one  oh boy  so no blame  on his part  and went and blamed  somebody else  well  I mean  I didn't even think  it was a matter  of blaming people  who got blamed  was it the guy  who was the head engineer  I would assume  Mars got a beating  yesterday for it  did he  I don't know  if he did or not 
[01:47:30]  oh man  but if  hey look  come on man  if you're nodding  just admit  you're nodding  if  even though Gary  might deserve  beating sometimes  maybe this one  is up to  is those guys fault  I'm not saying  it's Mars  but it's not even  the  alright  maybe the engineer  because we went  way too long  with this yesterday  I'll acknowledge that  but really fast  it wasn't even  the equipment  we wanted  so shouldn't  the radio wizard  get some blame  for that  why would he allow  an erector set piece  to be installed  when that wasn't  what we wanted  I think the idea  is that it was  ordered 
[01:48:00]  without his  knowledge  that specific one  was ordered  and installed  without his knowledge  that's weird  without his knowledge  he's the supervisor  oh  he's like a supervisor  right  yeah I mean  yeah he's in charge  he's an average  visor  he's the  I will never  accept  I'll take the  swoop  he's like  your boss  so I'd say  he's not  woo  he technically  is our boss  no he's not  our boss  trust me on that  he's the boss  no for real issues 
[01:48:30]  I fucking  I walk right  over his head  oh boy  I don't think  he likes hearing that  no we're feeling it  little bear tootsies  on his head  he probably actually  likes it  probably like a massage  I would like that  nice toes  massaging my scalp  don't confuse  don't confuse  the people out there  he's not even close  to our boss  oh boy  he kind of  I guess he  supervises you guys  that's about it  I mean yeah  I think he's in charge  of the channel  yes  not really  we're in charge  of the channel  everyone knows that 
[01:49:00]  I understand  who's who  that's why  there's a conflict  we're in charge  but he supervises  and he can't  supervise correctly  large and in charge  it's just stupid  if you're trying  to get in a radio  you would think  you would do  your job better  so you can move  up in the radio  world  instead of being  in a very low  position  oh jeez  oh jeez  I think we are  going to band  together and make  sure we're all  on the same page  once again  it was your fault  meaning the staff  it wasn't I  I don't know  if it was a matter  of fault  wow  what a cunt  that guy is  oh man 
[01:49:30]  what a dick  I know what  happened  you guys got  the blame  you guys got  a talking to  again  you are  never to blame  what a fucking  weasel  there was a  discussion  that was had  there wasn't  any  there was a  staff wide  discussion  in our meeting  yesterday  I understand  they scared  you a little bit  Sam  but I can  read between  the lines  how can they  scare Sam  we're going to  make you listen  to your own  show  that is scary  wow you guys  got another  talking to  no it was  a talking point 
[01:50:00]  in our meeting  yesterday  it wasn't  true  how bad  was Mars  ass  chewing  I don't know  because Mars  doesn't get  invited to  our meeting  so I wasn't  privy to  where's Mars  what happened  to him  yesterday  he does  have a very  clever shirt  on today  oh is it  one of those  products  but it has  to do with  with the  I think he bought  like a five pack  of those  what a creep  another MMA  pun t-shirt  oh Mars  nice  I love the  MMA pun 
[01:50:30]  shirts  that he wears  is it his  grapple  instead of  snapple shirt  oh grapple  I'll give you a hint  I'll tell you  what the brand  is  and then we  try to guess  what you guys  have to guess  yeah  alright  Subway  oh  Subway  Submit  we have a winner  wow  okay  but in the  Subway  fucking pun  Subway logo  doesn't he have  a Coca-Cola one  he was wearing it  the other day  yeah  what's the Coca-Cola  that's the one  that you guys  saw that said  I think a choke  out  instead of Coca-Cola  not even close 
[01:51:00]  they gave up  on that one  yeah they really did  he likes those  pun shirts  yeah he thinks  they're very clever  I don't know  he's probably  teaching somebody  some MMA moves  or something  yeah but against  their will  in the men's room  he's teaching them  how to lock legs  with a cock in your mouth  this is how you do it  so they don't escape  yeah  he's definitely  not fixing anything  maybe he's doing  push-ups  oh man  he does a lot of  push-ups every day  right  yeah yeah yeah  but he got yelled at  because of the mic stand  I don't know  like I said  he doesn't get invited  to our meeting 
[01:51:30]  so  I like  I don't know  very subtle  you're lucky  we don't have cameras  Mars is on his way  ah  E-Rock just whispered  that into my ears  yeah why wouldn't  he say it on the air  why on a radio show  would he say that  what is with  E-Rock  why don't you stop  faxing things verbally  and just say it  Dumbbell  you're on the show  he likes being mysterious  he loves whispering  in the vigils  stop whispering to ears  depending on what he has to say  he likes to pick somebody  in the room  and whisper to them  exactly  you're not shuttle commander 
[01:52:00]  Ed Harris  E-Rock has called himself  the minister of information  for the Opie and Anthony show  yeah  I hate how he does it though  because I'll be trying  to listen to a guest  and all of a sudden  I'll hear  hey  and he always starts  with hey  he starts with hey  like he tries to get  your attention  I'm like what  like he'd go into the mic  and go hey  what's up buddy  hey I just want to  let you know  did you see the news  hey I just want to  let you know  I got some gossip  on Scott and Todd  I can't wait  until you after the show  yeah  oh yeah  then it'll be  I'll tell you 
[01:52:30]  until you hear this  mention it after the show  don't tell me now  mention it later  stop whispering in my ear  you fucking creepy  little devil on my shoulder  I will guarantee  Mars got to talk it to  because he looks beaten  come on in Mars  we're just trying to get  an update on the mic stand  and we're trying to do this quick  his submit shirt  or sleep  and what is  what is  what is that supposed to be  or sleep  subway  I know  we get the subway part  oh no  I get it  I'm sorry  what's the or sleep part  either you tap 
[01:53:00]  or you go to sleep  no no no  I mean  in the whole thing  of the shirt  oh I know  I know what you mean  eat fresh  eat fresh  there you go  but eat fresh  is not  or sleep  no there's an E  it's not even close  why do you like  the pun MMA shirts  we need to know  they're free  where do you get them  a friend  of course they're free  a friend  who would pay for those  yeah  you said he's just a friend  does the friend  sell them  yes  way to not give him a plug 
[01:53:30]  some friend you are  I know  free shirts  and you won't mention his name  right  I hope he gets sued  for copyright infringement  I can't wait  until Dana  you want me to mention his name  huh  exactly  let's fucking tweet Dana  right now  actually I want to send a photograph  Dana won't care  Subway  all of them  a little company  called Coca-Cola  might have a problem  you think they might have a problem  with that  a little bit  stupid  buy us Coke socks  going in the bottles  so what happened yesterday  you got to talk

[01:54:30]  because she complained  she was drinking  a rum and coke  there's not enough coke  in this  really  he shoved it in her box  got some coke for you  you know he was found innocent  right  we don't care  history  has proven him guilty  history can kiss my fanny  yes  it completely ruined  his fucking career  truth smooth  it's a great story  exactly  I'd much prefer  you think I want to be remembered  as Jim Norton  the guy that did Monster Rain  or the guy that broke a bottle  inside a pussy  yes  he just had a whole article  on that  a couple weekends ago  how he was innocent  well she had some issues too 
[01:55:00]  oh yeah  she was  well his twitter  he had said something  and then people were like  what is  there you go  what does she look like  find Fatty Arbuckle's girl  just put like Fatty Arbuckle's girl  on images  it's a black and white photo  of a lady in a Pepsi hat  she hates coke  she hates it  she took the taste test  she did not like coke  yeah  it hurt  her vagina  it hurt her internal organs  she didn't like it at all

[02:00:30]  you a couple of  them  would you wear them  Jim  Chris I would  free shit  not the subway  that looks awful  that's some yellow  bright yellow  where's Mars  yellow  oh there he is  you see me coming  right  that's a horrible  one  I'm like Pac-Man  yes  gobbling up girls  in a parking lot  allegedly  so we got a guy  who lost his penis  and now they're  fucking going to  court over it  oh man  I feel  I hate the doctor  I read this story  you read this story  yes I did  attorneys are arguing  before the Kentucky 
[02:01:00]  Court of Appeals  that surgery  to amputate  part of a man's penis  was not necessary  Philip Seaton claims  the surgery  was supposed to be  a circumcision  and he never  authorized the  God  why does that  happen to Sam  or was he given  a chance  to seek a second  opinion  Seaton's lawyers  say a medical  waiver he signed  contains extremely  broad language  and that the doctor  that you informed  the procedure  should have sought  consent from the patient  that consent  it read literally  to say that  once you sign  that consent  and you're under 
[02:01:30]  anesthesia  the doctor  can cut off  your leg  if he thinks  that's reasonable  to do it  Dr. John Patterson  a Kentucky-based  urologist  maintains he found  cancer in Seaton's  penis during surgery  and that a portion  of it had to be  removed  Seaton and his  wife unsuccessfully  sued Patterson  in 2008  the appeals court  heard arguments  over whether a judge  erred in the jury  instructions  and if the  pre-surgery  medical consent  form was valid  or the language  in it proved  to be too vague  I think this doctor  is a fucking  is terrible 
[02:02:00]  because he's  saying he found  cancer  but when you  cut off a guy's  dick  you have to  give him the  option of doing  that or not  doing that  I don't care  what you sign  wake up  wake up  is it okay  if we cut  part of your  prick off  you gotta consult  with him  of course  you absolutely  have to  it's your body  I don't care  what waiver  you sign  you're right  you're not there  for cancer  you're there  for fucking  circumcision  cut the skin  off  oh god  would that  have been  great  if you came  in with  no dick  I would have 
[02:02:30]  been really  upset  bumped into  a bozeman's  prick  he'd been  bitten in  half  his prick  bobbed up  and down  no consent  form  had been  sent  upended  he'd been  cut off  from Cleveland  what was his  name  Herbie  something  I'll drink  to your  half a dick  you'll drink  to my  circumcision  cancer  operation  drink to  yours  anything else  on that  story  how much  does this  guy want 
[02:03:00]  for losing  his dick  couple of  bucks  couple of  shekels  yeah what  could he  load  hundred mil  Larry Flint  is in town  why don't we  get Larry  Flint on  oh man  roll his  ass in  here  I would  love to  have him  god he  looks good  yeah he  looks thinner  oh man look  at him  he's gotta be  up there too  at this point  huh  he's really  good  I want to hear  what he  sounds like  hey did he  sound like  can we hear  that  I want to hear  if he sounds  better on Fox  oh we can't  get that TV  because we  have all these  millions of  buttons but  we don't have  that button  that's Fox  business  that's the

[02:12:00]  to be wider  no  no wider  not wider  why not wider  probably because  there's something  about that  that fits in your  pocket  they're actually  going to make it  1 inch wide  and it's going to  be 3 feet long  that's interesting  it's very  portable  and they're going  to divide  the video up  into 4 equidistant  pieces  and it's called  Splice TV  and you have to  just figure out  what it would  look like  if it was  together  yeah it's like  watching porn  on fucking  WHT  when you didn't  have it

[02:13:30]  iPhones  in the first day  on launch weekend  would that be a record  yeah  I think  iPhone 4  sold 4 million  and what are  some of the  rumored features  that are different  than the  iPhone 4  I'm not sure  probably better  camera  thanks Mr.  thank you  well I mean  the big thing  is that they're  changing you know  the size  of the phone  fuck the size  what I want  features  well that's in  iOS 6  and they've already  detailed all that  stuff  well what is it  you know  stuff  you don't know  iOS 6  what is it going

[02:14:30]  4G  you guys don't have  4G yet  AT&T does  well AT&T and  Verizon do  but the iPhones  aren't  4G  why aren't they  because they  just chose not  to last year  because AT&T  hadn't really  ramped up their  service yet  Verizon's was  relatively still  new but now  that it's  everywhere  they have to  they're going  with it  what about  there was one  other thing  they need better  lenses for these  fucking smart  phones  what do you  mean  for picture  taken  you think  yeah man  absolutely  I think they  look  the pictures

[02:23:00]  i comes  the land  of the acid  snow  where the midnight  sun and the  husky go  it's not  gives a shit  we're not excited  about their facebook  page  it's the fact that  out of nowhere  five days ago  they started  counting down  to something  oh okay  yeah it's just  so they're obviously  releasing a dvd  that's what i said  the other day  i'm going with your  point because it's  obvious now  with that clip  by the way there's  nothing on the screen  except their stupid  weird fucking zozo  zozo man  logos and shit  black screen with that 
[02:23:30]  shit and then you got  the audio  what does zozo mean  oh some fucking  goofy  idiotic  psychothelia  who knows  crazy ass  brits  i don't know  exactly what it is  but i'm just  asking questions  head shake  head shake  head shake  head shake  he couldn't  he couldn't be  bob backland  for the both  really  i love bob back  but did bob do  the knee walk  the best  the knee walk  so stupid  would you take  him on the show  in a second  oh my god

[02:28:00]  the fucking  anti-hero  governator  he was the  first guy  from fucking  predator  to be  governor  got two  of those  guys  now  oh yeah  i got  time to  bleed  two guys  from that  two guys  from predator  yeah i wish  carl weathers  would run  oh yeah  he was good  dylan  what they got  to you  pushing pencils  sitting behind  the desk  pushing pencils  terrible fucking 
[02:28:30]  just regular  guy banter  oh yeah  my name is  bill o'connell  is it  yeah let's  not forget  he wore pink  suits and  fucking feather  boa  well we all  got bad  sunglasses  pictures from  our past  that's true  yeah but you  guys didn't  rip your entire  looks off from  superstar billy  graham  oh did he  oh man why  don't you call  him out on  that i'm sure  he'll be very  upset  who's that  where's the  honey boo boo's  mom  yeah what the 
[02:29:00]  fuck  we're ready  for honey boo boo's  when's that pig  supposed to call  why 930  because that's  when you booked  it for  that bug toenail  fucking yuck  the bitch got bugs  in her tootsies  she really does  that's disgusting  yeah  mike mcquery  plans to sue  penn state  what  in whistleblower  lawsuit  about what  whistleblower  and child blower  that's the kid's  name whistle  he feels like  you know  he did the right 
[02:29:30]  thing and  he's getting  penalized  he lost  his whole  fucking career  honestly they're  dumb to fire  him like  it just looks  like they're  firing the guy  who pointed  the finger  yeah yeah  yeah  he probably  has a pretty  good case  he is fucked  he probably  should have  done more  but it seems  like he did  enough as far  as the university  goes  no one wants  to hire this  guy even though  he's the guy  that spoke up  because he'll  never coach again  it's synonymous  with the scandal  although will he  not coach again  or will somebody  else hire him  because he spoke  up  his name is 
[02:30:00]  synonymous with  the scandal  so it's not  even like  most people  don't even know  the principal  players  he's so  tainted  he's got queer  in his name  no  it's crazy  god damn this  bugger  oh god damn it  use a fucking  napkin  oh right  oh fuck  he just put it  in his mouth  i don't want to  waste a napkin  we might need  that later  oh my gosh  well it was good  a little salty  so much more  worse when someone  else eats  it's actually 
[02:30:30]  stuck between  my teeth  it's like  fucking like  i've been  into a piece  of wax  it's sticky  really oh  it's not like  watching someone  eat doritos  and going  oh i can use  one  that's fucking  terrible  that wasn't bad  yikes  i like a salty  treat  oh fuck  it tastes like  a fucking  it tastes like  a smoked almond  as far as  the salt content  you don't like  buggers  no  oh  Kenny's  got an update  he went the 
[02:31:00]  other way  Kenny  no  i'm just  getting a kick  out of it  because he's  doing a lot  of rocking  in his chair  yeah he does  rock  i personally  think he's  partially autistic  that's my  opinion  really  maybe sway  is challenging  him  well they're  off the air  now so  they're having  some kind  of discussion  yeah because  he likes  having his  discussions  off  you don't  think sway  challenged  him  no  no why  would he  so they're  probably in  break  probably doing  a two-parter  over there  yeah yeah  yeah  lazy stuff  going on  over there  so mcquery  yeah he's 
[02:31:30]  gonna sue  he'll probably  do all right  with that  you think  yeah  unless there's  a legit reason  they let him  go  i think he should  have done way  more but it  probably did  the bare minimum  well his  contract expired  though so they  obligated to  rehire him  after his  contract  but they  didn't fire  him i think  the terms  ended  they just  need to  move on  yeah  people associate  the scandal  with him  they don't  want anything  with that  scandal  how's that  team doing  they lost  their first  one  uh they  lost last  week too  bad  oh man  no i think  they were  winning like  almost all the  way to the 
[02:32:00]  end  didn't they  lose some  players after  the ncaa did  what they did  and said you  could move on  to another  team  i don't know  they're still  doing okay  they haven't  won yet  they haven't  won since  uh what  98  they haven't  won a game  since 98  longest losing  streak in  college football  history  wow  not one win  since 98  wow  what a dick  move  fuck  it's got  a dick  move  paterno's  family  i feel bad  for paterno's  family i mean  you know they  didn't do  anything  a lot of  people were  in tough 
[02:32:30]  spots but  still i think  you gotta do  the right thing  yeah  haven't won  since 98  chopper  what about  chopper  chopper  they're gonna  go down  they lost  17-16  so they're  gonna go  down in  history as  the worst  college football  team ever  well i mean  in the last  20 years  yeah  and they're  not good  they haven't  won  wow  but i  understand why  they did  that was  that was a  really amazing  move by the  college  yeah  that's hilarious  that's great  and you know  like the  rival uh 
[02:33:00]  schools will  rub that in  that's crazy  because they  had good  coaches  i don't know  about that  whole taking  wins away  thing it's  like it  didn't really  happen it's  this 1984  revisionist  history thing  the players  know they won  those games i  guess i'm  going to  think i'll be  right back  i'm gonna  piss my  pants  we'll fucking  do a quick  break when  we get back  june from  honey boo boo  will be on  our goddamn  show  better be  gonna have

[02:42:30]  fame  um you know  it's pretty  interesting  um i never  you know  kind of feel  like surreal  like you know  wow a lot of  people know  who my  daughter is  like you know  whether it  be celebs  or it  be singers  or you  know whoever  it's kind  of you know  interesting  people that  i you know  like in  life um  that i  looked up  to um  are kind  of like  wow they  know who  my daughter  is and  i'm like  wow  it's kind  of interesting  it really  is 
[02:43:00]  are they  paying you  guys well  there was  rumors that  you guys  didn't make  much money  off this  show  um you  know all  i can say  is that  tlc is  very well  compensating us  if you  believe  half of  what you  read  then you'll  be okay  because a lot  of people  they wrote  out there  in the  tabloids  um 95%  of it i  can tell you  is is  half the  truth in  most of  its lives  let me ask  you this  you make  enough money  where you  can move  so your  house isn't  right up  against the  train tracks  no we're  not moving  um i really 
[02:43:30]  enjoy where we  live at um  we're not  moving anytime  soon but  how many  how many trains  go by in a  day um  during the week  we can have  a total of  probably 40  to 50  trains  oh my god  that's crazy  and how many  feet away is  the tracks from  the actual  house  um less than  100 feet  yeah because  uh tlc loves  showing every  time they show  a shot of the  house they always  show a train  going by so  they think that's  kind of funny  yeah because  literally like  one just went by  probably 15  minutes ago 
[02:44:00]  like when i was  on another  interview  wow  and we'll  probably have  another one  come by in  probably like  five or two  minutes on  a weekday  because this  is what they  call chalk  country  um they  we have a lot  of chalk  mines here  and so  literally they  transport everything  like you may  have a train  that has like  caterpillar parts  on it  there's no like  there's no like  Amtrak trains  or anything that  come through  it's mostly like  yeah it's mostly  like you know  just like you  know industry  things coming  through  does it shake  the shit out  of the house  no 
[02:44:30]  hey i gotta  ask you  something uh  now i i saw  your episode of  toddlers and  tiaras when it  first aired  and uh  now that  well it was  like the first  one that uh  you and honey  boo boo were  on um  and and i i'm  just curious how  did they pick  you out of  because we've  seen a lot of  uh compelling  little characters  like uh  you know there  there's been a  few uh  rambunctious kids  and stuff that  you think would  have made a  a good show  what what what  did you guys do  that really 
[02:45:00]  caught uh  tlc's attention  um you know  honestly they  say that you  know alana's  personality  honest our  when our tlc  episode aired in  june in january  of this beginning  of this year  we were the  top show  that tolerance  here's had  you know with  viewer wise  um and so we  you know we  thought that was  an honor so  we just kind of  they were like  would you be  followed again  so we were  followed again  and within that  same time period  that's when tlc  came and said  america was  wanting to know 
[02:45:30]  the inside  life of alana  and the family  how do we act  outside and at  first i was kind  of leery i'm not  gonna lie and  then you know  they kind of  like i was like  look the only way  we're gonna do  this is if we  can be real and  you know we  can be who we  are and that's  the only way that  i was gonna do  it and they  allowed it they  were like okay  that's the only  way we want you  to be is yourself  well it's obvious  that you and uh  the family have  big personalities and  uh you guys are  hilarious man  except for sugar  bear sugar bear  is pretty mellow 
[02:46:00]  yes he always  has been  why why does  his eyes roll  into the back  of his head when  you guys are all  on the couch  is he that  bored  i don't know  i didn't ever  pay attention to  that  hold on a lot of  people a lot of  fans of the show  want to check in  we got um  uncle paul uncle  paul you're on  with june from  honey boo boo  ah boy hi is  this really june or  is this just a big  put on and what  not  it really is i  love your show i

[02:51:30]  a slut i didn't call  her a slut i asked if  she was one do the  publicist hang up is  that one of these uh  like fucking things june  are we living in a  world where we get  hung up on by a june  from honey by the  honey boo boo mommy  that was probably the  publicist you're  kidding right hello  june the phone's still  uh yellow the line  just didn't come  yellow come on june  what happened let's  call her back sure  june june june  june someone's there 
[02:52:00]  beaver june and hang  up uh june wait so  she's mad because she  became a mom at 15  that's crazy she's  grandma 32 i asked  if she had uh say if  she was sexually active  like really if she was  uh yeah what's wrong  with that she was a  goer it's a white  trash show what the  fuck are we supposed  to ask if you're  fucking pregnant at 15  you were kind of the  slut what the fuck's  going on that's all  i'm saying we live in  a world where we're  pissing off honey  boo boo's mom well 
[02:52:30]  the only call call  probably didn't help  the what that probably  started the road too  well in this interview  she had a bad attitude  when she got on the  phone roland what's  up roland  problem what  happened roland  they still there  uh probably not  because uh we had to  wrap up anyway so they  just probably went to  the next one oh you  think that's what it  was just like that  yeah oh roland's  rolling his eyes what  what did we do wrong  he's roland his eyes  hey hey you got time  it's honey boo boo  i know she farts on  the show she farts and  burps on the show  she got a rotting toe  she became a mom at 
[02:53:00]  15 a grandma at 30  they talk about their  vaginas on the show  and she says she  doesn't wear makeup  because men will find  her too sexy  she's got sugar bear  who's in my humble  opinion on some heavy  shit i didn't even get  into her couponing  i want to do a whole  segment on her  couponing  get her back in line  oh boy that ain't gonna  happen  not at all  she started this with a  bad attitude  she did come on like  yeah hello  i'm not a morning person  i'm not a morning person  well fucking  we knew that  yeah right 
[02:53:30]  oh man come on  i know  wtf  it's a good question  what are you gonna do  with the other thumb  i know lol  if your kid has two  thumbs that's something  you gotta think about  eventually what are you  gonna do with the other  thumb  i don't want to talk  about that  plus you phrased  everything so gently  yeah  i thought so  hey honey boo boo mom  welcome to the show  what's up with that toe  but why wouldn't you  have your granddaughter  featured on the show  i know  why wouldn't you have  the granddaughter  grow both fucking  thumbs on the one hand  because she was born  with two thumbs on one  hand and then eventually 
[02:54:00]  you take one of those  thumbs and you fix your  fucking forklift toe  that's a good fucking  idea  it is a good idea  outside of the box  thinking  homegrown  so  i don't get it  some of those  anti-rejection  drugs  i think it would  fucking take  where's dr steve  oh boy  get dr steve  on the line  got a medical  question  jesus  and they still  haven't hung up  by the way  or maybe they went  to another  they just went  to another one  so it's like  when you click  over for another  call  so maybe  they'll come  back by accident 
[02:54:30]  yeah  by mistake  they might click  over  they'll be like  hey it's the  greg and tony  show  dude the last  episode  she pulls her  sock off to  finally show  this forklift  toe  which they've  been talking  about forever  and there's  bugs all around  and of course  we're gonna ask  her about it  that annoys me  now  like why  wouldn't  oh god  the picture  of her  jesus christ  um  that annoys me  like like  why wouldn't  she just be  more forward  about her  her you know  early sexuality  and uh

[03:03:30]  dr steve  dr steve  we had june from  honey boo boo  really quickly  yeah  she was on our  show and she  hung up on us  that's how bad  our show has  gotten  that she hangs  up on on us  she's insulted  by what we're  asking  but she has a  fucking forklift  toe that looks  like it's rotting  i think we talked  about this the  other day with  you with the  bugs remember  now her  granddaughter  it just so  happens was  born with two  thumbs on one  hand right  okay  so i said to  honey boo boo's  mom there june i  said why don't you  let the granddaughter 
[03:04:00]  grow both thumbs  for a while  yeah donate one  and then fucking  yeah and then  farm it out and  make it uh  her toe  yeah  is that possible  is the question for  you today dr steve  okay um they did  a hand transplant  recently on a guy  and um and it  was a donor  hand and uh  you use anti-rejection  drugs and you uh  have to uh you  know sew the the  vessels properly and  the nerves and all  that stuff but yeah  theoretically it's  possible  oh really 
[03:04:30]  so theoretically it's  not a stupid idea  but it's why she  got mad i don't know  what she got mad at  there's a lot in  there why would you  replace a useful  appendage though  and the other  thing is just  what are you  talking about  well her her  thumb her her  uh toe is still  useful  it's rotting  it's obvious  it smells so bad  the gnats jumped  on it immediately  i think that has  to do with more  with hygiene than  the why didn't  the fucking gnats  hit any of the  other toes i'm  sure she has a  dirty foot in  general god  yeah well i mean  you're speaking  theoretically it's  certainly possible 
[03:05:00]  the the thing to  do is to go seek  medical attention  get your toe  debrided and cleaned  up and uh you  know uh change  your socks every  once in a while  and uh and  uh you know if  you can live  without a toe  as well it makes  a little bit  harder to walk  but they can  just put a  little prosthetic  or an orthotic  in your shoes  i wish right now  i was living  without ears  dr steve  well played  my friend  well played 
[03:05:30]  uh you got a  show to plug  there dr steve  yeah weird  medicine saturday  nights at uh  and the uh  whatever that  channel is  the opian anthony  channel  oh right  that one  another rerun  yeah no no  thank you  yeah we can  talk about sal  next time about  running my show  three weeks  you know sal cost  him money  three weeks in a row  he ran the same  show  and it cost dr steve  money  yeah it did cost me  money  who supervises this  shit  how does that  get paid for  replays  oh my god
