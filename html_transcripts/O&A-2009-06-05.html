<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a New York Post photo depicting Hamas members watching Obama's speech, leading to speculation about Obama's foreign policy and humorous conjecture about Osama bin Laden's potential Twitter use.  This segued into a broader conversation about the effectiveness of different U.S. presidents' foreign policies and military actions.  The conversation then took a shocking turn with a graphic and extended discussion of David Carradine's death and autoerotic asphyxiation, fueled by listener calls detailing personal experiences with choking during sex.  One caller recounted a bizarre failed rape fantasy attempt, and another described a partner who enjoys being choked unconscious.  The hosts also discussed a news story about a North Carolina man who arranged for another man to rape his wife.  Interspersed were humorous tangents, including John Sterling's home run calls and a caller recounting a similar autoerotic asphyxiation death in the military. The segment concluded with a listener call about enjoying being choked during sex and a comedic bit about a man accidentally killing a prostitute during a sexual encounter involving autoerotic asphyxiation.

The show continued with discussions of the movies *Very Bad Things* and *Fargo*,  followed by a "Twitter girl" segment featuring Heather, who discussed her interest in rough sex and choking. This led to a tangent about a convicted murderer.  The hosts then critiqued Mike Francesa's on-air meltdown, John Sterling's announcing, the poor reception of *Land of the Lost*, and the publicists' refusal to grant them interviews. They analyzed a seemingly underwhelming Roger Clemens moment in Yankees history, critiqued the Yankee and Met stadiums (including the broadcasting of announcers' voices into the bathrooms), and discussed Denise Richards and unusual athletes like Jim Abbott, a one-armed basketball player, and a legless football player.  The segment ended with further discussion of Francesa's outburst and a mention of an upcoming Lady Gaga segment discussing "cock."  Heather was the only explicitly identified in-studio guest.

A significant portion of the broadcast centered on Jimmy Norton's recent health scare involving a painful testicle injury from boxing, a cancer scare (initially fearing testicular, then prostate cancer), and a graphic description of his prostate biopsy, which he compared to a large dildo.  He detailed the post-biopsy bleeding in his urine, stool, and ejaculate.  The segment included numerous listener calls sharing graphic details of their own medical experiences, covering topics such as testicular injuries, prostate issues, colonoscopies, vasectomies, kidney stones, MRSA infections, bowel ruptures, and colostomies.  A medical professional, Owen, called in to provide some context.  Anthony Cumia visibly became unwell and needed breaks.  Kenny, Joseph T. Curry, Trucker John, and several other unidentified callers participated.

The show featured a "gross week" theme with highly offensive and sexually explicit humor, including discussions of blowjobs at rest stops, menstruation (with graphic descriptions), and speculation about the sexuality of their executive producer, Gelman.  They recounted a graphically detailed anecdote about a failed attempt to set up Gelman on a date with Regis Philbin.  A demo from intern Club Soda Kenny was played, featuring highly offensive and sexually explicit jokes.  Ryan and Nicole from a morning show reacted negatively to the demo.  A tense argument between Opie, Anthony, and a co-worker, Steve, ensued regarding Steve's unauthorized online posting of show segments, escalating into personal insults.  A mystery guest appeared in studio using a fake voice, ultimately revealed to be Ira "Cream Pie Jones."  Clips from the made-for-TV movie "Bill," featuring a character with intellectual disabilities, were played, accompanied by offensive commentary.  Footy made a brief appearance.

The final segment included repeated use of the word "retard" while discussing a scene from "Bill," and a game guessing movie characters with intellectual disabilities.  A video titled "Drinking Out of Cups" was played, with the hosts using homophobic and other offensive slurs to describe the person in the video. Charlie, the video's creator, and other interns Matt and Sam were mentioned.  Another mystery guest segment, using a disguised voice, revealed the guest to be Ira "Cream Pie Jones."  The show concluded with more offensive commentary and speculation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Good Friday morning.  That's right, live programming for you, my friends.  Yeah.  You're listening to the workhorses of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  We call horses asses.  Oh yeah.  We never workhorses.  Hey, oh wah.  Oh wah. 
[00:00:30]  Oh wah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  The cover of the New York Post.  First, the let's be friends.  Hamas thugs watch Bam Woo Muslims.  That was Obama's big speech yesterday.  A thing, uh...  But you know what?  A lot of high expectations for Obama's speech.  I know where you're going to go with that, and I understand.  No, you'd be surprised, to tell you the truth.  You'd be very surprised at my answer to that.  I want to go out to the media. 
[00:01:00]  I hate it.  I want to go out to the newspaper, first of all.  Yes.  He was talking to all Muslims pretty much yesterday.  Yeah.  And they choose that picture.  Instead of like hard-working Muslims raising families.  They couldn't find that guy.  Yeah, right.  The Muslims that look a little more like you and I, they had to go with the extreme picture.  Yeah.  With the Hamas guys that are completely covered up with their...  What kind of weapons do they use?  Oh, the ever-famous terrorist AK-47. 
[00:01:30]  The AK-47 on their laps as Obama's, uh, on the TV in the background.  Yeah, dressed in military regalia and, uh, the hood.  Wait, what is your angle on this?  I don't want to sit around the house, by the way.  Uh, no, I...  Actually, my angle would not surprise you.  Um, I think Obama, uh...  Shouldn't be doing this?  Shouldn't be trying to make friends?  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, not, not, not at this point yet.  I mean, it's...  Okay, let him, let him throw out as, you know, Salamu Alaikum and, uh, and, uh, let him, 
[00:02:00]  let him talk to Muslims and, and try to make the world believe that we're, we have so much  in common and, and, uh, you know, oh, we're, um, we have a lot in common with, uh, Islam.  Mm-hmm.  You want to talk to Muslims today?  Um...  They're out there.  And I bet you they listen to our show.  Yeah, let's see.  Let's see.  I swear to God, there's a lot of Muslims that listen to this show.  I don't doubt it because, uh, some of the, uh, cab drivers, uh, have said that they, uh, 
[00:02:30]  listen.  Nah, it's more than that.  No?  Not just cab drivers?  It's always the extreme that, that causes the problems.  Well, that is true.  With these religions.  But, um, you know, again, even the ones that aren't extreme aren't the ones that are criticizing,  uh, the extreme ones.  Well, what, what is Al-Qaeda going to do?  Doesn't this kind of mess up Al-Qaeda a little bit?  Like, what the, who the...  Well, uh...  They count on, on, you know, us being assholes. 
[00:03:00]  Osama bin Laden.  Mm-hmm.  Not to be confused with Obama.  Uh, he put out, um, a couple of statements in the wake of this whole Obama thing to try  to, you know, deflect it.  Did he put it on Twitter?  Yeah, he Twittered.  Is he tweeting?  He's tweeting his pics everywhere.  Here's my cave.  I mean, at this point, you gotta think he's not going with the old technology, the VHS tape.  Yeah, now you could just Twitter your statement. 
[00:03:30]  Shouldn't he just be tweeting?  You think they'd get his IP address?  You could tweet some videos and some pictures.  Enough with the VHS tapes that you gotta hand from one person to another.  He runs down from Afghanistan.  Right.  And then kill people on the way.  All right, you, you, uh, you, you give the tape to this guy and then someone's waiting  to kill you.  Okay, brace the chain.  Right, right, right, right.  Sorry, go ahead.  No, it's true, but, uh, yeah, Osama, uh, kind of put out a statement and said, eh, you 
[00:04:00]  know, this is all crap and it's just posturing and, um, they, they ain't buying it, but I  think, I think it's a kind of a desperation cry because, um, and it makes them, not that  they look good in any sense of the word, but it kind of makes them look really silly in  the eyes of the world and stuff, because even though I, I don't think, uh, Obama's, um,  uh, message here is going to be effective at all as far as a, uh, uh, uh, hatred and  a war that's been going on forever, uh, I really don't think it's going to help, but, 
[00:04:30]  um, it makes these extremists look a little like, you know, yeah, we hate America, hate  them, and, and, you know, here's this guy, I guess, trying to do something, uh, whether,  whether you believe if it's going to work or not, and I, I don't, but.  You kind of think it helps a little bit.  Would you agree with that?  Does it?  Of course.  Does it?  I'm familiar.  I don't know.  I, I don't know, because other people say it shows, uh, weakness, uh, in a country that 
[00:05:00]  cannot afford to look weak.  I'm with you on that.  I think Obama needs to, like, bomb something.  Yep.  Just, just come, come up with something.  Put the bomb in Obama, finally.  Come on, do it.  That's right, but I, I think it's.  That'll be a headline, by the way, if he ever does take military action.  Oh, yeah.  Obama, they'll, they'll put bomb in there and show the country.  Get some kind of grenade or something and just, like, get, get an excuse to bomb something.  Get in and out and show that you got some nuts on you. 
[00:05:30]  I think that would help, uh, a lot.  Yeah.  Because even Clinton fired off a few cruise missiles after he got in.  Yeah, but then he pulled us out of Somalia, which, uh, which made us look weak.  That made us look very bad.  Very weak, very bad, and, uh, completely, uh, just that was the end of Somalia at that  point.  They knew.  Woo-hoo, look, we just beat up the big guys on the block, and they left.  Yeah.  So we'll do whatever we want now.  But Bush, I'm sorry, Bush didn't look weak at all.  No one thinks Bush was weak.  I mean, he was feared and still didn't help us. 
[00:06:00]  I mean, the U.S. doesn't look weak with George Bush Jr. as far as the military.  There's no country that thought we wouldn't fucking kick the door and help us.  It didn't matter.  It didn't help us.  We don't, we can't necessarily tell if it helped or not.  We didn't get hit again.  Uh, that, that was a plus, you know, and it wasn't for lack of trying.  Uh, a lot of the Democrats and liberals will tell you, uh, uh, oh, you know, well, we didn't  get hit again, but, uh, maybe they weren't trying or this or that.  Yeah.  It's documented evidence that they tried to hit us again, especially right after 9-11. 
[00:06:30]  Uh, and, uh, you know, a bunch of frigging savages decided they wanted to, uh, uh, have  an encore.  And, um, because of things like, you know, Bush's hard, the hardline stance and, and, uh, uh,  his, his cronies there, Rumsfeld and everything else, uh, getting the CIA and FBI to work together,  things like that, uh, and the constant posturing of, hey, access to evil is, uh, Iran's got, 
[00:07:00]  you got to keep an eye on these sons of bitches.  And that, you know, regardless if we, um, uh, put sanctions against them or anything,  we still were, were very hardline against them and, uh, and, and, and let people know  that we did not like what they were doing.  I mean, not necessarily his policies here, which I, I agree with a lot of them.  I mean, talking about overseas, like this fact, no one thought he was a pussy, whether  they hated him or not, but it didn't help other countries work with us.  No, no, but, but that, that, that I don't think is necessarily the United States fault 
[00:07:30]  over the course of his administration, as much as it is, as it is this now, uh, united  and great Europe that is, oh, look at us, we're so, oh, United States, oh, George Bush,  oh, the, you know, go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Bailed your goddamn ass out, uh, uh, of a couple of wars and, uh, you know, now they're  all, now they're all pals trading the same money. 
[00:08:00]  Hey, I, I actually agree with you a lot.  I don't, no one would be happier than me if Russia just got a little noisy again and started  fucking and started reclaiming a little lost territory.  Start, start your annexation.  A little lost.  Could you?  That's funny.  Hey, the phone's lit, Ant.  Uh, people are saying you're against peace.  Let's, let's say I am.  Mike in New York.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Hold on a minute, Mike.  Always fun.  Yes.  Go ahead, Mike.  All right, Mikey, go ahead there. 
[00:08:30]  Damn it.  I guess, uh, well, I'm just going to have to wonder why he said I'm, I'm against peace.  I'm not against peace.  I wish, uh, all of our, uh, soldiers were, were back here, uh, uh, within the comforting  boundaries of our own United States of America and not overseas.  Less, uh, comfortable though.  Uh, North Korea saying they could reach us now.  Well, they were testing some ICBMs.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know how that goes.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  Our first, we're talking to Muslims today, Ant. 
[00:09:00]  Ali in Chicago.  Ali.  Now, uh, Ali.  Yes.  What do you do for a living?  Um, I actually drive a cab.  There you go.  I was trying to help out the Muslim world.  There it is.  One for Anthony.  I drive a cab.  Let's keep it honest.  Hold on, hold on.  We're doing a, we're doing a little bit today.  Let's keep it honest.  I want to talk to Muslims.  And so far, one for Anthony, because he assumes all Muslims drive.  Drive cabs are the only ones you're really going to know that listen to the show. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  Let me try again.  Any kids?  Uh, no, but I go to school.  All right.  Where do you go to school?  Uh, University of Chicago.  University of Al Qaeda training camp.  What do you do?  Those frigging swingy monkey bar things?  How do you drive with an AK on your lap?  Why did they, why did they release that video thinking that was going to scare us?  The, the monkey bar thing.  Yeah, where they do that hand over, you know, you got to kind of, uh, it's the, the ladder,  the, the upside down kind of ladder that you got to swing.  It's actually a birthday party activity. 
[00:10:00]  They play hopscotch right after that.  Jump rope.  It's fun.  If they thought that was going to scare us, uh, wouldn't we have just sent our fifth graders  to take on Al Qaeda?  Yeah.  The presidential physical fitness test they're taking.  Yeah, exactly.  Uh, go ahead, Ali.  Well, you guys, you guys want to know what Muslims think about, uh, Obama and his speech  yesterday, correct?  Uh, yes.  Well, I can tell you what, what, what Muslims are thinking.  Okay.  He just hung up.  All that to hang up? 
[00:10:30]  Just to hang up.  Matt girl.  Gotta respect that.  All right.  All right.  The Jews, none too happy either.  The Israelis, none too happy.  And I know what Jimmy's, uh, take on this one is, uh, that we've kind of put ourselves  in bed with them long enough.  Uh, hard line, um, they can do no wrong stance that we've had over the years.  And Obama's kind of opening up to the Palestinians, saying that they both deserve a homeland.  Uh, with a shared, um, uh, capital, that's the kind of, you know, it's the whole Jerusalem  thing is a little iffy, uh, with, with each of them. 
[00:11:00]  They both consider it the holy land and want to lay claim to it as far as whatever homeland  the Palestinians get.  They want that to be part of their homeland.  But I haven't had, I won't say I haven't had enough of Israel because a lot of times  Israel has offered them everything they wanted and then Hamas was still firing rockets  over it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I just don't want any more new shit built.  No new settlements.  Come on guys, you gotta fucking stop it.  It's making the whole thing a mess.  The buffers within the buffers.  Yeah.  It's, you gotta stop with that shit. 
[00:11:30]  But I, I, I love Israel because they react very hard.  They don't need our help with Iran.  If, if Ahmadinejad gets like, he pipes up a little too much, they'll fly their planes  over every other country, bomb his reactors and come home before fucking eight o'clock.  They don't fuck around.  That's absolutely true.  We missed a great phone call, uh, talking about Obama bombing something.  Someone on the line was like, would John Sterling call it a, a bomb?  An old bomb.  For Obama.  Of course, referencing this, which is worth playing one more time. 
[00:12:00]  Of course it is.  Swung on and hit in the air to deep right center.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Oh, Hadiki Matsui.  He has a three run blast at deep right center.  It's an A-bomb.  It would have been if Alex had hit it.  Instead, the Sayonara Kid hit it.  You couldn't, you shouldn't say Sayonara Kid after the A-bomb. 
[00:12:30]  No.  You should just say.  He has an A-bomb.  I feel sorry for you Yankee fans.  You gotta deal with that crap.  But you see how nice that call was?  I just, what?  It was good until he started, like, up until that point.  That was an exciting home run call.  And then he has to fuck it up with his stupid, corny shit.  I'm not a fan of the announcers making it about themselves.  Just call the fucking game.  You're not on the field.  You're calling the game.  I listened to the end of the game on the radio yesterday.  And he's like, the Yankees win. 
[00:13:00]  Right?  Why do they allow that?  They encourage it.  They must.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Like, you get some of those solid, old-school announcers.  They just know how to call a game, and they don't make it about themselves.  Maybe they have a home run call that's harmless, doesn't really hurt anyone.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Sterling just takes it way, way too far.  Right, we know. 
[00:13:30]  Sometimes it's just noises, though.  Blow that picture up, Daniel.  What do we got?  Some...  No, no, down.  Oh, you want to see Bruno's ass?  No, right there.  What's that about?  Oh, that's Eva Longoria.  I can't tell if she's hot.  Eva?  That looks hot right there.  Yeah, she's hot.  I'll tell you that.  She's...  She'll get you...  She'll get you a boner.  She'll do you some justice.  She'll get you a boner. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, uh...  I thought she was naked, naked.  David Carradine, dead, and the Post using Anthony's fine line from yesterday that got a car crash,  actually, on this very radio show.  I decided to car crash it because I wasn't proud of the line, but it was...  You've got to take into consideration how quickly it is after the news breaks that you've come up with any kind of joke.  We pretty much broke the news of David Carradine's death.  We had some correspondents, some O&A correspondents in Bangkok calling us immediately, and we broke the news in America. 
[00:14:30]  We're very proud of that.  Travis, do you have the line that Anthony used yesterday?  All right, check this out.  Wow, really?  Kung Fu?  Oh, Hung Fu.  Kung Fu.  That's all right.  I like Kung Fu.  Kung Fu is funny.  I like Kung Fu.  I'm also going to go with that.  So, the Post liked Hung Fu because that's their headline today. 
[00:15:00]  That's their headline.  Right on the front page, Hung Fu.  Unbelievable.  How disrespectful.  Oh, shit.  Obviously, we do this show, and I don't think the Carradine family is listening.  Mm-mm.  Yeah, but we're not like a news thing either.  Yeah, yeah.  You're supposed to have some kind of like...  The break right before it was probably how much jizz would fit in a room.  God damn.  I was telling the guys from Red Eye about that last night.  I was telling them about that Breitbart had picked up our tax rant and things like that, 
[00:15:30]  and we probably had some people that were going to tune in and say, you know, wow, okay,  I kind of like that.  Let me tune in and see what these guys are about.  I said, and there we were having a conversation of how much explosive diarrhea could fill  a room up with mathematical equations.  It really kind of blew an opportunity there yesterday, but...  I want to get Michu Kaku involved with our theories.  I don't think he'd jump in. 
[00:16:00]  I think he would go with it.  It would all depend on what universe the studio is in.  Right.  Would it?  Time is a river of shit or jizzum.  A kum river?  Yeah.  The doctor?  Time is a delicious river.  So Carradine dies.  I think...  You're kidding!  I think the authorities over there in Bangkok were trying to help out the family.  They're like, oh, he committed suicide, man.  Like, oh, we've seen this before. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  He committed suicide.  The family's like, no, man, he had a wonderful life.  He wouldn't have committed suicide.  He had no issues.  And then the authorities are like, all right, well, we were trying to cover this up.  But it looks like he died, you know, with a rope around his genitals, a rope around his neck.  And now they're saying when he had the big orgasm, it might have caused a heart attack.  Oof.  So that's the story that is now being reported.  Whale.  Instead of a suicide thing that makes everything just kind of go away. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  How do you jerk off in the closet?  I told Ant there's no way he was...  You don't jerk off in Thailand.  There's too much going on around you.  Well, if you're into autoerotic asphyxiation, you do hang yourself, sort of, and take the  weight off of your feet in some kind of a closet or on a doorknob or something like that.  Doorknob.  And then as you're orgasming, you're just about choking yourself out.  And then you're supposed to stand back up, loosen the rope, and you have a great fucking 
[00:17:30]  orgasm.  And end of story.  But the chances...  There's chances that you're going to pass out.  That you're going to pass out.  The blood is not...  And once you pass out...  You're not standing up any time soon.  Now your weight is all on the neck.  And you're, uh...  You're dead!  That is insane.  Yeah.  That is insane.  Certainly is.  What about the rope around the genitals, Anthony?  Does anyone know what that's about?  Extra added twist, I think.  Just to keep the penis nice and hard? 
[00:18:00]  Was it like kind of a cockering thing?  Like almost a Dr. Cockering.  It's, uh...  I think if you tie it around your neck, then over the top of the, um, coat hanger there in  the...  Well, the thing you put the hangers on.  And then down to your genitals.  And then slowly let the pressure down.  Imagine that.  Now you're pulling your nut sack and your cock, your sausage.  How bad do you need a cum?  How much exactly? 
[00:18:30]  What the fuck?  I know.  I...  How much stimulation do you need?  Just to jerk off and squeeze your nuts.  You start in Kung Fu, you're embarrassing yourself.  Yeah, look at what you're doing now.  Now they've got to fine you?  Like this!  Now the front page of the paper is telling them when you jerked off with a rope on your  weenie.  That's what you get.  That's unbelievable.  Hung Fu is the front page today.  Hung Fu.  How humiliating.  To be Hung Fu.  How are they reporting it elsewhere in America?  Um, I bet not Hung Fu. 
[00:19:00]  I think Hung Fu takes the cake.  I think the Post is the only one doing the Hung Fu.  Absolutely.  Do you know, like, all through his movie career, all through his television career, he never  imagined that he would be dead from jerking off and everybody would know it.  No.  I don't get that one.  Do we have listeners that have tried this thing?  You have co-hosts who have.  You've tried it?  I'm not just joking.  Why would you take the chance?  Unless maybe, I'm trying to think if there's a safe way to do it.  Like, you're choking yourself, right? 
[00:19:30]  Maybe you're holding on to the rope, so if you do pass out, would your hands let go?  I don't know.  If that rope is tight around your neck.  Oh, I see.  Is it a noose?  Or maybe it's a loose noose.  That's what I'm getting at.  Loose noose.  Loose noose.  If you're pulling on the rope, well, then you've got to have a hand free to crack it.  Tickle your nipples or tease your balls.  Yeah, that's the, you know.  Who the fuck would take that chance?  That is.  Well, they're saying that's how, what's the name for him?  In excess went also.  There's nothing wrong with a little kink, but that's like taking it right to the edge. 
[00:20:00]  How old was he?  71?  73.  73.  See, maybe he just ran out of ways of jerking off to get creative.  But he's in Thailand.  Yeah.  Don't have to jerk off in Thailand.  There's a lot of shit going on over there.  So many things to, so many things to put your weenie in.  You know, any of you guys have been choked?  No.  No.  I don't like the feeling of being choked.  Call me silly.  I like it very light.  I can occasionally, I prefer to do it.  But I've gotten very light choking. 
[00:20:30]  Nothing too harsh.  It felt good.  No.  While you were coming?  Just while I was fucking.  It's, uh, it's rare, but I've gotten a couple.  I can't take it all the time, but I've gotten a couple times.  It was hot.  Never.  No way.  For real.  No way.  Do you choke?  Have you ever choked someone?  No.  You never choked anyone?  Even that scares me.  No.  Why would you do that?  No.  I wouldn't you?  Oh, that's like crazy kind of.  Oh my God.  No?  That's not fun sex to me.  Oh my God.  That's like a violent kind of, um.  No, no. 
[00:21:00]  They just like the way they feel.  It's not an anger thing.  I'm not angry.  But you're actually comes across as that.  Choking somebody, regardless of how you feel about it, it's an angry thing to do.  Not necessarily.  And spanking, it's just like spanking their fucking jugular.  Spanking can be good-natured and fun.  Yeah, a little good choking is not angry.  Choking is never good-natured and fun.  Spanking, a little biting, I'm in.  But, I mean, the choking thing always scared the shit out of me.  Choking is a violent act.  Wait.  It's a violent act in any context.  But there's a lot of people that have done this, so Jimmy's not crazy and- 
[00:21:30]  No, he is.  Does the girl actually, like, she's choking?  Um, she's not turning like a little red or anything, Jimmy.  Oh, her face gets lightly red, but I'm very, very, uh-  No, Michael!  I don't, uh, no, no, I'm very, very-  You let off today.  I'm not crazy when I'm doing it.  Oh, of course you let off or you'd be-  Jimmy.  The murderer, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I'm not-  I'd never let off.  Killed many, many a girl.  That scares the shit out of me, but you're talking a lot of people's language.  People do this.  Yeah.  I-  I- 
[00:22:00]  Danny?  Well, look, not for nothing, but most of the time it's-  It's not like I personally get off on something like that, but most of the time it's the girls-  Of course it's the girls.  They choke me?  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, man.  I never just choked a girl for no reason.  I've wanted to during a game.  I've had yapping.  Yeah.  I've had-  It's nothing to do with sex.  I've had some weirdos in my life, but I've never came across someone that wanted to be choked.  Oh, some of them wanted to be choked and slapped.  It's amazing, yeah.  I would-  Have you ever come across a girl that needed to be choked at?  Or at least next to her.  No, yeah, next to her, believe me.  But, uh, no, I- 
[00:22:30]  I would-  But what a big trade-off that is.  If she says, I want to be choked, you could then use that as a bargaining chip for, okay,  I want to fucking go balls deep in your ass.  You know?  It's like, that's a trade-off.  Hey, we've all had the girl that wanted to be gagged with something.  Yeah, here you go.  Oh, but I mean-  No, I don't know how that-  How that goes into play in sex.  It's beyond me.  Why hasn't anyone used this line yet?  Although, uh, the David Carradine story is not even 24 hours old yet. 
[00:23:00]  Steve on Long Island.  This is brilliant.  Go ahead, Steve.  Go.  Good morning.  I guess Bill finally got killed.  Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!  What a fucking asshole.  And I was paying attention to the news and how they were reporting his career.  And they said, David Carradine, you might remember him as the- in his biggest role,  the star of the 70s TV series Kung Fu.  He was also in movies like Kill Bill. 
[00:23:30]  So, Kung Fu got top billing in every report I heard.  It shouldn't, though.  Kill Bill, I think- I think more people-  Wow.  Danny, I know you were having fun with the cum and the diarrhea and the snot yesterday,  but-  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  But I want to use your-  I want to use your-  Using it all as Lavoris.  I want to use your talents for something good today.  All right?  Like a superhero.  I want to- I- I don't know.  I think I'm going to lose this one.  What?  I think more people saw the Kill Bill movies than the Kung Fu movies. 
[00:24:00]  Well, the Kung Fu-  The Kung Fu movies-  I-  Yeah.  Well-  It was a TV show.  Oh, you're right.  So that was like a lot of-  What was his big movie then, before Kill Bill?  Uh, God, it really was.  Um, God, I can't-  He's done a shit on the-  Cannonball.  You're right, actually.  Death Race 2000.  Um, oh, and then he had the one with the Old West.  See, I-  Uh-  Obviously-  Long Riders.  Obviously, I'm stupid, but I was thinking that a lot of these TV shows, uh, you know,  get made into movies, but that's one they never made into a movie. 
[00:24:30]  You're right, Ant.  He had a lot of real bad movies.  Yeah, forget it, Dan.  It's not going to work if you-  You can't do TV versus a movie.  But he had a lot of-  A lot of, uh, movies.  Yeah.  Let me-  Yeah.  Uh, let me say hi to Walter.  I don't know.  Walter.  Yeah, look at all that.  And it's all shit.  Two over 200 movies.  Uh, Toilet Crusher from Buffalo writes,  Oh.  Crouching Tiger, Hanging Dragon.  Oh, God. 
[00:25:00]  Uh, Walter, what do you got?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  God's going to get you for that, Walter.  Thank you.  Thank you all, dear friends, for coming to my birthday.  What do you got, Walter?  Hey, uh, I was listening to Dr. Steve a couple weeks ago, and they did a story on it.  They did a bit or a thing about it.  Him and his, um, co-host, they did a story about it.  Hey, what would happen?  What'd they say?  Jesus.  If they did a story, a bit, the thing, it was a pre-produced piece. 
[00:25:30]  Whatever you want to call it, they did something.  What was it?  Fucking spiraling out of control.  Well, they were saying-  You're like the fucking, you're like somebody on the Air France flight worrying, when's the  peanuts coming?  They were saying that they have, a lot of the professional auto-fisciators have a special  thing there that keeps them from crushing the bone on their neck, or their throat.  A special thing that keeps them from crushing the bone on their throat?  You know, so that way when there's so much weight that's put on, it releases. 
[00:26:00]  What is the thing that they have that keeps them from doing that, a good upbringing?  Same thing that the catchers wear in the major leagues.  Oh, you get a little throat guard?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it was on Dr. Steve's show.  You sure it was a show?  Yeah.  And not a cavalcade or a get-together?  Some kind of a show thing.  A broadcast?  It was a thing.  Yeah, it was one of his broadcasts that he had on.  Let's wake up that stupid winemaker and get some info on this carotene thing. 
[00:26:30]  Maybe let him sleep in a little bit today.  Yeah, you think he's got some-  Well, this guy's saying Dr. Steve did a show on it.  Oh, he did?  Okay, well.  Let him sleep in a little bit.  Give him another hour.  Poor guy.  We'll go back to this.  Let's say hi to Jack in South Carolina.  Jack?  Hey, buddy.  I got two of them for you.  Yeah.  First off, do you think he should have come out of the closet?  And also, tell Davey to get his calculator.  He says, I wonder how many times it would take David Carradine to jerk off and fill up the closet. 
[00:27:00]  A Bangkok closet.  A Bangkok closet.  A relatively small closet.  Are they small closets?  Yes.  They're very small, I think.  Not a lot of room over there.  He was working on a movie, apparently.  Let's go to-  Called Stretch.  Yes, it was.  It was called Stretch, ironically enough.  Why does that always work out?  I don't know.  I don't understand that ever.  It always works out, though.  Think about it.  Rico.  Hey, good morning, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I'm in the military, and I did a couch recall back in 93 for a kid overseas who dressed 
[00:27:30]  up in women's clothing, hung a rope around his pole, and as soon as he came, he ended  up hanging himself because he lost his balance.  And we had to notify the parents of this, you know, what he did, and the parents pretty  much refused to believe what the kid did until we showed the pictures.  And then they just tried to change the death certificate from autoerotic association to  suicide, and it was just a mess. 
[00:28:00]  So, that's all I got, boys.  Have a good day.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Ross in New Orleans.  Ross.  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey, Ross.  How are you?  I'm all right.  So, yeah, my wife was into choking and, like, rape fantasies and shit.  Yeah.  Um, you know, and she tells me this, and I'm like, you know, I'm not really into that  at all.  I'm like a real passive dude.  And, uh, so we decided to do it, and she's taking a bath, and, you know, she didn't want 
[00:28:30]  me to tell her when I was going to do it and all that shit, so I did a t-shirt, like a  black t-shirt, and I'd, like, you know, cut some holes in it for a mask, and I'm standing  there, and she's taking, like, an extra-long fucking bath, and I'm standing in the fucking,  you know, hallway with this t-shirt, my fucking penis fucking just dangling.  Fucking, fucking not hard at all, just waiting, fucking stupid, holding this knife, waiting  for her to come out.  Finally, she gets out of the fucking bathroom, and I grab her, and the only thing I could 
[00:29:00]  think of is, I'm going to fucking slice you, and it just sounded so stupid coming out of  my mouth.  We both fucking laughed, and then, you know, the mood is just shot from there, so I just  pushed her onto the fucking bed, and I'm eating her pussy, and fucking started choking  her, and I guess I was, you know, I mean, because I'm a big dude, and I was choking her  kind of hard, and then I got scared, and I just, like, I got to stop, and she's like,  no, no, no, stop, and, you know, I said, I can't fucking do this, man, and then I realized 
[00:29:30]  I just had a freak for a wife.  It's funny that you were trying to be all dominant and sexy, and then she laughs, and  you said, fuck, I just took her purse and left.  She just turned it into a robbery.  That is a great visual right there, Ross, I got to tell you.  A lot of women do have that, though.  He's right, man.  Rape fantasy, I think.  Well, that's why, you know, we talked to some of the youngsters out there.  You got to have the premarital sex.  You just have to.  Because you got to know what your chick is into.  Abs-abs-fucking-lutely.  Some of these people that are waiting for, you know, marriage and all that, and then you  realize you're married to, like, a freak that's into some shit that you're not into. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Imagine, like, you know, one of these good Christian broads, and you finally get married,  you finally have sex, and realize she's into this rape fantasy thing, and you're like,  I don't fucking know.  Yeah.  Now you're like, oh, God, I got to do this now for our whole sex life.  Right.  I got to make believe I'm raping you.  What are you, wait outside?  Yeah.  All right, I'm going to come in.  What are you going to be doing?  Start throwing pebbles on the...  All right, you've come downstairs late at night, you can't sleep, for some cocoa, and I'm 
[00:30:30]  going to bust in the kitchen.  Yeah, do you choreograph it?  Do you choreograph it?  But if you choreograph it, then...  Then the whole fantasy part is gone, so...  Ross, what do you have just...  I have a way of waiting, you know, just, you know, because she didn't want to know.  She was very specific.  Don't tell me when you're going to do it, you know, just do it.  So I hear she's taking a bath.  I'm just fucking standing out there like a fucking asshole with a knife in my hand,  my t-shirt, fucking...  With the holes all...  Oh, the cops would have shown up and shot you.  Yeah, how would you explain that if a cop saw that? 
[00:31:00]  Well, it's in my house.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  But some of these people, they start their fantasy outside looking like idiots.  I had one of the neighbor calls.  Well, I had a girl ask me to dress up like an attacker and raper, so I put on like a straw  hat, and I had a corncob pipe, and when she came out, I said, get on the bed, you.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Yeah, thank you, Ross. 
[00:31:30]  That's what I needed right there.  All right, punch it out, guys.  All right, let's go to...  That was a great phone call.  Wouldn't it be perfect that I'd dress up wrong, like she says, I want you to dress up like  a rapist, and you show up in a full baseball uniform, or dress like a UPS driver, with  like a little bonnet on your head.  She said, I'm totally unsexy.  What are you doing?  With two catcher's mitts on.  Grr!  Just roar a lot.  I'm here to rape you.  Yes.  You put on a dumb accent.  I'm going to give you a rapping.  Just say it wrong.  You bitch, I'm going to rap you. 
[00:32:00]  Let's go to Greg in D.C.  God, we got a subject.  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Good morning.  Thank you.  Thank you, all dear friends, for coming to my birthday.  Thank you, Opie.  That's hilarious every time.  I don't know if...  I was just thinking, I don't know if it's hilarious anymore.  I don't know.  It went beyond...  It's not getting the laughs that it used to get.  Yeah, I might have burned it out.  It's still enjoyable, though.  We're going to have to rest that, I think. 
[00:32:30]  We'll go with the new one.  Oh, it feels good to laugh.  What do you got?  Where are we?  Greg, what do you got, man?  Yeah, well, I wanted to call and let you know, I have had sex with many a woman who enjoys  not only being choked, but being choked until she's unconscious.  I've actually perfected a way to use a pillowcase and wrap it around the girl's neck, pull it 
[00:33:00]  right behind her ear, and have her unconscious in about five seconds.  But there's also another way to find out if your girl is into being choked without actually  choking her by having sex with her doggy style, leaning over her, putting your arm in  front of her and kind of having, letting her put her neck in your elbow joint.  Choke yourself.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  My wife's name is Leonard Lawrence, sir.  As she leans her head into that, and you can tell that she's starting to not breathe, 
[00:33:30]  put your other arm over her neck and just kind of push.  Now, if she doesn't tap you out, you just push hard.  Tapping?  I can't.  You lost me so fucking far ago.  This guy is a professional.  Tapping out.  How do you even keep a fucking rod when you're choking a bitch?  That isn't.  How do you not?  I don't want them to ever pass out, man.  That would fucking.  No, trust me.  The first girl I ever did this with, I was 25. 
[00:34:00]  This girl was 17 in college, and she was just finding her freak side.  And I, oh my God, nine and a half weeks was not even close to the crap we did.  But this girl, one, I mean, she turned to me one time while I was fucking her, and she  just goes, choke me.  So I grabbed the pillowcase.  I started to.  And when she went unconscious, she went stiff, and it scared the crap out of me.  And she woke up coming harder than she had ever come in her life. 
[00:34:30]  And that's pretty much how it became with us when she would really want to just get  fucked.  She would just say, choke me.  And then what else would she enjoy?  Like, when that got to be old, she'd want you to step on her foot really hard and give  her a paper cut.  She actually said to me, punch me in the face.  One time she said, I don't care what you do, but when I say I'm coming, hurt me.  Um, I got bored one day, and I had her fuck herself with a flashlight. 
[00:35:00]  Um.  Yeah, that's what you do when you're bored.  Large cucumber, D batteries.  I, I didn't get off on that stuff.  What I was just having fun with was seeing what else I could have her put inside her.  That's somebody, I think, that had some issues.  Just a few.  Growing up.  Mom used to beat her with pots and pans.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That'll do it.  Who used to beat her with pots and pans?  Her mom.  Mom.  Oh, this poor girl.  She's Betty Crocker's daughter.  She would put cake batter in her cot and kick it. 
[00:35:30]  Well.  Thank you, boys.  Punch it out.  We got the phones lit, Jimmy.  Phones are lit with their stories.  And, uh.  Stories.  Rich K in, uh, D.C. getting back to David Carradine.  Hancock.  Oh.  Hancock.  That would have been, okay.  Even better.  It was Bangkok, sure.  I don't know if you could, uh.  Oh, wow.  Look at this one.  Rich in Louisiana.  What's going on down there in Louisiana?  A lot of calls from Louisiana today.  What's up, Rich?  Hi, my boys. 
[00:36:00]  Hey.  This happened in Kanapolis, North Carolina a couple of days ago.  A guy hired another guy on Craigslist to come to his house and rape his wife.  And he sat there and watched it.  I heard a story up there on the news.  Yep.  So why did it make the news?  I don't know.  No, I mean, is she okay?  Did something go wrong?  Uh, well, they, they played her, uh, the 911 tapes that were calling the police.  And she's like, I've just been raped.  Oh, my husband watched me there. 
[00:36:30]  It's real weird.  So, but you're saying that she wanted to be raped, so.  No, no, no, no.  He hired a guy to break into his house and rape his wife while he sat there and watched.  Yeah.  And the kids was in the other room.  It's real weird.  It's, it's really weird.  But, I mean, the guy had confidence enough to set this up.  So, I'm wondering if they had some kind of conversation where the wife's like, yeah, that's my, my thing.  And maybe.  No, she, she was completely out of the loop.  She didn't know anything might go on. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, my God.  That is fucked up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's on the news.  Uh, I heard yesterday.  Can we find that 911 call, Danny?  Uh, you have the story.  I don't have the.  I don't have the call.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Well, what, we actually have that story for today?  Yeah.  What a coincidence.  All right.  Uh, Dr. Steve, you know a little bit about tying a rope around your cock, right?  Around your cock?  Yeah, that's why we're calling you.  Someone said you're an expert at that or something.  Around the neck and then the, uh, the.  Around your cock.  And then the, the, the balls. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  And penis.  Yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  No, uh, David Carradine.  Uh, we're learning now that, yeah, he, he was choking himself.  He had a rope around his neck and a rope around his cock.  He was really trying to get off.  And they're now saying that the, uh, unbelievable orgasm could have caused a heart attack, my  friend.  Well, yeah, it's, uh, you know, when I heard about this, he had just started a new movie  and I wondered if maybe this is what was going on because it didn't sound like he was 
[00:38:00]  in a position where he would commit suicide.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  Uh, you know, this, uh, his erotic asphyxiation is, uh, a deal where you intentionally cut  off oxygen to the brain and it got, you know, for sexual arousal.  And it actually is classified as a, what we call a paraphilia or a sexual fetish.  It's got a bunch of different names, you know, scarfing, uh, cuts, warism, or breath control  play.  And the people that do it are, you know, in the, in the, in the community are called gaspers. 
[00:38:30]  Wow.  Um, gaspers.  What, what happens, uh, there's, there's a bunch of deaths.  It's like, uh, 250 to a thousand estimated per year in the United States from this.  Wow.  And, um, uh, more than the swine flu.  That's a lot.  Yeah.  Why isn't the news all over this one?  Yeah.  This is a pandemic.  It is.  It's harder.  It's, it's more badass than the swine flu virus. 
[00:39:00]  But the, uh, the, uh, what, what usually happens is, is they'll have some mechanism so  that when the, uh, when the, uh, when the orgasm is over and the choking is done and they've  come just right to the point of, uh, uh, losing consciousness that the, some control mechanism  will let go and then release their, the, the neck.  And a lot of times it's something that they're holding in their hand. 
[00:39:30]  And so then when they faint, they let go and then it releases the tension on the neck.  And, uh, the, the problem with it is sometimes, I mean, some of these folks aren't rocket scientists  and, you know, the pulley that they've got isn't perfect and it gets caught.  And then the release mechanism doesn't work and then they die, you know, because they  actually lose consciousness and they are not able to help themselves. 
[00:40:00]  And so they're found in these really, really, um, embarrassing kind of situations when people  find them dead.  Oof, how embarrassing.  Especially with their porn of choice opened on the computer in front of them or on the  floor.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, Pete Townsend.  What was he doing research for?  Oh, no.  Bill Hicks has a great bit about that one too, man.  Fucking Bill Hicks.  Oh, what, the magazines that your parents find? 
[00:40:30]  Well, like, it's weird because he ended up dying, it's weird because he ended up dying  young, but one of his bits was about how, you know, you die and then your parents have  to like kind of clean up your apartment.  Go through your stuff.  Yeah.  And then they're finding this horrific porn that you were into.  Well, yeah, this is even worse because when they come in, I mean, you've got basically  your dick in your hand with the whatever thing that turns you on sitting there right  in front of you.  It's really, uh, it's, and then it's just hard to explain to everybody. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, and then if rigor set in and you're holding your dick, they got to take you out and stretch  you out.  I mean, you've got a lot of respect for him, but you know, just in general, I mean, it's  just a, it's a bad thing and, and, uh, makes for bad party conversation.  But yeah, you know, um, and since it's an accidental death, life insurance will usually  pay for it.  That's the one.  Ah, right.  Right.  So you don't want them to say suicide.  Right.  Does it erase, does it erase a great career though? 
[00:41:30]  No, I, I don't.  Depends on what you did.  That's what I'm saying.  Like with the charity, great career.  And then you go out that way.  Nah, it's just, that was an accident.  I mean, it was just something that he was turned on by.  A lot of people are turned on by, uh, this asphyxiation.  I mean, uh, I mean, do you hold your breath when you jerk off at all?  I mean, that's, if you do, then that's, you're kind of experiencing a little fraction of what  these people are doing.  Yeah, no, I like, I like breathing all the time. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of breathing all the time.  Yeah, I don't see it.  I don't see the, the turn on, but.  Well, look at the phones though.  I know people just.  We're out on this one, Ant.  Yep.  Uh.  We're the weirdos.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Okay.  Anytime, boys.  All right.  Thank you.  There he goes, Dr. Steve, the, the winemaker.  Good doctor.  Uh, cunning linguist from Atlanta.  Jerking off in Thailand is like bringing a sack lunch to a banquet. 
[00:42:30]  Very good.  Uh, here's the story.  Cops say North Carolina man arranged wife's rape on Craigslist.  A man used the online advertising service Craigslist.  Craigslist is going away.  Too much bad press lately.  They're fighting back.  They're actually, it's amazing.  There's so many other places.  Go to backpages.com.  You can get escorts there.  Go to a fucking hundred other sites.  You can get escorts there.  What's the fucking problem?  That is the brand name.  And that's the Xerox name of all these sites. 
[00:43:00]  So they're going after that one.  Correctamundo.  Yeah.  So he used Craigslist to enlist another man to rape his wife in the couple's home.  Police said Wednesday, the 25 year old, uh, Chang Wang Khan.  Nah, just a town in North Carolina.  I don't feel like trying to, uh, I wish, uh, try to, uh, pronounce man.  Faces first degree rape and other charges.  His wife called police early Sunday morning and said a man with a knife raped her in the  bedroom of their home about 25 miles northeast of Charlotte.  Uh, her husband was in the room.  Police said the two young children were also home, but were unaware of what was happening. 
[00:43:30]  The husband saw young son in the car.  The husband saw someone in the ads to come to his home and have sex with his wife using  scare tactics.  Police said it was without her knowledge or consent.  Wow.  That is fucking weird, man.  That is authority still investigating the identity of the man who attacked the woman.  And it wasn't known if the husband paid him to do it.  The woman was not seriously injured, but was treated at a hospital and released.  Now, if this guy had no knowledge of any crime being committed or, and thought that the wife 
[00:44:00]  was in on it, and the husband, like, pays him and says, look, here's the deal.  She loves this.  You just go in there.  No matter what she says, you, you know, you'd be stupid, but, uh, how responsible is he really?  It's going to be, uh, interesting to see how this one plays out.  Yeah.  I bet you he gets off.  He probably did.  Uh, yeah, we already said David Carradine's movie was called, uh, Stretch. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Ron in Waterloo.  Ron.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi, Ron.  Our own head?  Uh, yeah, I remember a couple years back, up in the Syracuse area, um.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A guy, um, killed his wife, choking her out with the phone cord while fucking.  Right.  And then what happened to him?  He was, um, what happened to him?  I think he was tried and everything. 
[00:45:00]  He was tried, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was tried.  Uh, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Did he go to jail?  Yeah, I think he did, bud.  Yeah, I do remember that.  Hey.  I don't.  One of our own likes to be choked during sex.  What?  She might turn out to be Twitter girl for this Friday.  Oh, stalker Patty.  Heather Heitz, everyone.  Heather Heitz.  Good morning, boys.  Hi, Heather.  I like calling her HH.  Hey, HH.  How you doing?  Good.  So you like being choked during sex? 
[00:45:30]  I love being choked during sex.  Really?  Really.  I've never passed out.  I can't seem to get to the point where I pass out.  What a shame.  Do you want to get to the point where you actually pass out?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I wear like a...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't get it.  I really don't.  I don't get the choking.  Explain this to us, Heather.  I have like a leather collar, and my fiancee will pull back on it while we're having sex. 
[00:46:00]  And I get like really close to passing out, but he lets go.  Like, I guess I turn kind of purple.  Oof.  I want to get him on the phone.  It must scare the crap out of him.  Is he into this?  Or is he just doing it because, you know, he loves you?  No, he's into it, too.  Really?  Very mutual.  I love her.  That's why I'm doing this.  She's dead.  He hurts me because he loves me.  This is the typical scene where the politician or the guy...  And he's chopping her up in the bathtub again. 
[00:46:30]  There he is.  It all starts out as fun and innocent.  Like at first, it's a little choking.  And she goes...  And he lets off.  And they laugh.  Oh, that was hot, right?  And then a little longer, a little longer.  And then before you...  You know what?  She's turning purple.  No pulse.  I can't call the police.  My wife.  He's like...  He's sawing through her thighs.  See, I know the listeners have their favorite bits. 
[00:47:00]  That is probably on my top five.  I probably think about that.  One of my favorite bits that is so twisted.  Yeah.  Because the whole scenario of like a guy just trying to have a little fun.  He's been married forever.  He's got kids.  And maybe he's not...  Never did anything of that.  Maybe he's not even having sex with his wife anymore.  And he's like, you know what?  Just once.  Yeah.  I'm going to take care of myself and have a little fun.  Just a little.  Go a little crazy.  Get a little kink in there.  And he knows it's only going to be one time, one time only.  Maybe he's celebrating a big birthday. 
[00:47:30]  He's on a business trip.  With a hooker.  Right.  She's not going to say a word.  She's into the choking thing.  They're both into it.  He's totally having a great time.  Right up until he kills her.  Something just goes horribly wrong.  And then he doesn't know what to do because he's never been in this situation before.  But he's got to get rid of the evidence.  And you know you've got to spend the night with the body because you just don't know what the fuck to do.  So the body is just with frozen eyes in the hotel room.  You're freaking out and crying and you're exhausted so you fall asleep.  And when you wake up, those glazed over eyes are looking right at you from the pillow next to you. 
[00:48:00]  And you're like, it wasn't a dream.  It wasn't a dream.  I was hoping it was a dream.  And then now it's checkout time.  It's 10 or 11.  I love this bit.  I'll do it again.  I don't give a shit.  And the maid is knocking on the door.  Are you checking out?  One minute.  He leaves her in there as he goes to True Value Hardware to get the tools he needs. 
[00:48:30]  Like fumbling the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.  And then the phone is on vibrate, just vibrating on the dresser.  Yeah, yeah.  It's your wife because Johnny had a great Little League game and wants to tell you all about it.  You've got to be like, yeah, honey.  No, it's fine.  I'm going to be here a little longer than that.  No, it's my hay fever.  You know how it is. 
[00:49:00]  And the maid comes back.  Is everything all right in there?  Fine.  Fine.  You've got to make the uncomfortable call to the front desk.  Can I get a late day?  Can I get a late day to check out?  And at first he's very tentative, so he has to put her in the bathtub and chop her up.  Do you drain all the blood out first?  Well, that's just that he doesn't know what to do.  So he tentatively just picks up her hand by her pinky and just starts sawing through her wrist. 
[00:49:30]  At first, just crying.  Not knowing that it's a horrific thing full of blood and gore.  And it's harder to get through than he anticipated.  And everyone has to understand it's just a regular guy.  Saw blade brakes.  Now he's changing blades.  We're not talking serial killers.  This is just a regular guy that just got into a horrendous situation.  Way too deep and escalated the problem because he's never getting away with this.  We have another scenario where he puts the hooker in his luggage, tries to get past the front desk. 
[00:50:00]  He's just going to dump it somewhere in that town.  Yeah, the cop's coming to the door.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, I'll be right there.  Okay.  Oh, it's one of my favorite fucking bits.  Yeah, we've done it with the bunny suit.  Oh, yeah.  The bunny, yeah.  Because then he was in the bunny suit thinking it was going to be a funny gag.  Yeah.  What was it?  Because he had a plushy fantasy?  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  I love that one.  That is one of my favorites.  Oh, yeah.  We got to write that officially and really go with it.  You know what?  Maybe try to sell it to a network.  You know what the part of it is that's so horrible?  Yeah, see, this is from, what, Prostitute Vegas?  All right.  I was trying to find that scene from Very Bad Things.  Very Bad Things?  Where one of the guys in the party accidentally kills the hooker in the bathroom.  Yeah, she slips and cracks her head, right?  Yeah, I think he was fucking her up against the wall.  Yeah.  And, like, there was some kind of loose thing that came down and there was, like, a screw 
[00:51:00]  and, like, her head goes into the screw.  Yeah, right into it.  But then, like, the movie kind of revolves around what to do with this dead hooker body.  Like, it just, and it just snowballs from there.  It's pretty much the same thing.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  It's not an original idea, but, uh...  I thought it was, but I guess not.  Well, because the scene is also in, uh, uh, The Godfather 2, when they set up the, um,  the senator.  Oh, right, right.  And there, and he's like, ah, we were...  And he gently tries to move her head, and that's when he realizes there's just blood everywhere. 
[00:51:30]  And, oh, she's dead.  We'll take care of it.  You were a guest at the Corleone house last night.  Look, she doesn't have a family.  And they completely set that up to get him in their pocket.  They drugged him and killed her.  Yeah.  And boy, did his tune change.  Oh, boy.  That's why...  The Italian people are a good, hard-working people.  That's why I love that Fargo movie, too, because it has a lot of that stuff, too.  That was that, too.  A guy that just got in way too deep, just an average guy. 
[00:52:00]  Thought he was just going to get that ransom money, take care of that little business deal  he won, open up his parking lots, and get out of trouble.  And I did tell you that I sold that movie to my girl as a comedy, right?  We did that break on the air.  Oh, yeah, and she was just like, oh, my God, what are you showing me?  We sat down and go, this is one of the funniest movies you're going to see.  Why are you showing me this?  Fargo.  Fargo.  Fargo is fucking great, man.  But she finally got it, why it is a funny movie.  Is it Favreau fucking her? 
[00:52:30]  Jon Favreau.  Heather, I didn't want you to hang up.  We just wanted to do our little bit, and we were going to come back to you.  Every Friday, we pick a Twitter girl, right?  I think Heather qualifies.  Yeah, sure.  She's got to call back after the break and give us a little more, and if we're satisfied,  we give out her Twitter and get her some followers today.  Right.  We started this with my friend, Mare, who, man, I got some stuff on her.  I don't know what she wants to talk about on the air, but.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  I got to think about it, though.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  And then who was last week's Twitter girl?  Boy, I forget so quickly.  Oh, Mashup Nicole from the Mashup.  Oh, how could we forget?  From the morning Mashup.  And today's Twitter girl could very easily be Heather Hype, but she's got to call back  and give us a little more.  Oh, wait.  Is that the actress in this movie?  She was in Lost.  Didn't she play that sexy one that Jack met in season three?  Is that Slater, too? 
[00:53:30]  Wait.  The hooker.  Go back a little, Danny.  Can you get to her face?  The hooker looks like an Asian chick.  Yes, she was an Asian in.  Oh, wow.  What's her name?  Can we check her name?  This calls for IMDB.  It certainly does.  The sexy Asian hooker who got killed accidentally while they were fucking her in the...  Very Bad Things 2 is the video that Dan just found.  Is it part two?  Really?  No, no, no, no.  It's one movie chopped up into like 10 parts. 
[00:54:00]  A bunch of pieces.  Oh, so if you do two, then you'll get the scene we're talking about today.  That was segment, yeah.  Those guys would learn.  Kill one hooker.  Take it easy.  Get hand jobs.  By the way, there's an article in the Daily News not only smashing broadcasters who eat  eggs while talking, but I made that up just to be clever in a moment, but killing John  Sterling.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Killing him.  Oh, good.  We'll do that after the break.  Did you just say John Sterling? 
[00:54:30]  John Sterling.  Oh, it sounded like you said John Sterling.  No, no, no, no, no.  I might have said that because there's eggs in my mouth.  John Sterling.  You know, if we're going to talk...  It is high.  It is far.  Behold an ass.  Kobe's high.  Yeah, she was even lost.  If we're going to talk about sports, our old friend, even though we were never friends,  good old Mike from Mike and the Mad Dog had a meltdown that is getting a lot of play on 
[00:55:00]  YouTube.  Really?  Maybe the boys could pull it.  What happened?  He is way too into sports.  Oh, you got a meltdown over sports?  Oh, yeah.  Over something important.  I never understood the sports radio guys that get that into it, where they're yelling and  screaming.  We do the same thing over dick jokes.  I get a little rambunctious at times. 
[00:55:30]  I guess you're right.  But, no, I can understand if it's your team and you're kind of, you know, a passionate  sports guy about that.  But if you're a sports reporter, what was he getting all freaked out about?  I don't know.  He was yelling about Andy Pettik.  And, I don't know.  You got to pull it.  Yeah.  I was just more amazed that his face...  Did I choke myself?  I was more amazed that he was turning red and just losing his mind.  Yeah.  I don't have the specifics in front of me right now.  Are you saying it was much to do about nothing?  Pretty much, yes.  Heather Height is back.  Heather. 
[00:56:00]  Yes.  We were just going off-roading.  We were getting back to you.  Sorry about that.  We want to do one of our bits just for us, because I don't know if anyone else enjoys  it.  Yeah.  And the tit monster thing we're still trying to develop.  Yeah.  The guys that are into the real big boobie girls.  Oh, like H.  Cup Jane.  H.  Cup Jane.  Yes.  She's got quite the set.  She sure does.  Very nice.  She actually had drinks with her and her husband the other night.  Really?  Yeah, after my set at Broadway. 
[00:56:30]  Wait, what is that about?  Are you guys...  Because I know a little something-something about H.  Cup Jane and her husband.  She's talked about it on the show.  They like to do a little, little, little, you know...  Swingy?  A little swingy swing.  I don't know if it qualified as a date.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  So, Heather, we're thinking of making you the Twitter girl for this fine Friday.  That'd be awesome.  So you like to be choked during sex.  Yes.  Well, I guess what I wanted to ask you before we went off-roading, where did this start?  All this goes back to something. 
[00:57:00]  I think it just started with, like, you just want to keep stepping it up, you know?  Like, you get, like, a spank here and there, or, you know, being knocked around a little  bit, and I like rough sex, and it just kind of evolved.  It's about, it's more about being helpless.  That is never a defense, by the way, in court, when you just go, we were having rough sex.  It's never an excuse. 
[00:57:30]  They never go, well, okay, we understand.  She was a whore.  Chambers lost a Jennifer Levin case like that.  I don't know if he was being truthful or not, but he probably was at one point.  At one point, being truthful, he just choked her while fucking her brutally.  Yeah, probably.  But then to do that thing at the party?  That's what killed him.  That's what killed him.  My name is, oh, I shouldn't say that.  Choking the doll.  Little piece of shit.  Yeah, he really is.  Back in prison, by the way.  What a dummy.  I know. 
[00:58:00]  How much do you like jail?  You serve all that time, and you can't fucking keep out of trouble.  Just stay clean, man.  How long is he back for?  Are you 15 more years?  Oh, they said, you know something, you fucked up.  He's done.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Long time.  And, Heather, you turned colors and all that, huh?  Yeah.  What?  Oh.  What was the craziest thing you did that you want to admit?  The craziest thing that I've ever done.  Oh, ew.  Oh, jeez.  I've done a lot of crazy things. 
[00:58:30]  Let me think.  Well, actually, one time my fiancé hog-tied me to the bed, and he left me there while he  went shopping.  Did you like that or no?  I did.  It was amazing.  Wow.  How is that amazing?  I'm just so...  Are we square?  He, like, shut all the lights off in the house and just left me there for, like, an  hour.  Because you're, like, a possession for his pleasure, at his convenience, for his disposal. 
[00:59:00]  There are people who...  I don't know if that's the exact turn-on.  That wouldn't do it for me.  I'd get very claustrophobic and bored.  How did it end?  He came back and got me off and made me say I was going to be good and untied me.  Had he used coupons when he went shopping?  That's what we're talking about.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at that thing there.  Did he come back with some good stuff?  Yeah.  When he was shopping?  It was just like a regular shop.  You know, a little breaded egg.  You know?  How do you go to, like, the supermarket while your chick is hot tied back home?  Yeah.  You're pushing the cart. 
[00:59:30]  Hey, how you doing there, Mrs. Smith?  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  I have a card here.  Oh, and...  One of my Wall Bombs cards.  I'm actually, I'm chatting with him online.  He reminded me, we also went into a porn shop and fucked in a Jack booth.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  That's like...  That I could see doing.  Did they know you were in the booth together or no?  Yeah, they knew that we went back there together.  And right before, like, we both had our pants down, some guy came around, because they're  open.  They're like, like the one side, there's no door to shut yourself in. 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  Oh, right, right.  He walked around the corner and was like, just stood there and stared at us, and he  was like, dude.  I'd see, okay, that's something I can almost say, like, that I was actually, I would be  into.  I did it, I did it years ago and stuff.  A lot of outside fucking.  I like fucking in the great, out of doors.  Yeah.  You know, in the woods.  Something like that.  I love the woods.  Yeah, just like going to the woods, and then you just kind of lean against the tree, like 
[01:00:30]  animals.  Just don't do it on a beach.  No, beaches are not good for fucking.  It looks good when you see it in a movie or something, but wow, those granules could  do some damage.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Fuck that shit.  We have a...  You ever fucking a dump?  That's kind of hot.  You throw it down, and there's roaches and rats on her and gulls.  That's a seagull he has, pecking her head.  Once again, Jimmy ruining it.  Hot places to fuck a dump in August. 
[01:01:00]  Hot garbage.  On a pile of hot garbage.  Well, Heather, I think we're giving you Friday's Twitter girl.  Thank you.  What's your Twitter name for everybody?  Heather Height.  Heather Height.  Yep.  H-E-I-G-H-T.  Yes.  Follow Heather Height.  There you go, a new pal.  You've made a lot of new pals.  That's right.  I'm the Twitter girl.  Yep.  Twitter girl for this Friday, Heather Height.  All right.  All right.  We'll see you soon, all right?  All right.  See you soon.  And she loves the F.H. Riley's, by the way. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, yes.  Which I greatly appreciate.  Why don't we take a break?  Before we go to break, I spoke to Rob Bartlett last night, and he thanks everybody for having  him on.  I want to just plug for his son.  His son's name is Devin, and they're doing that Take Steps Walk for Crohn's and Colitis.  It's the worst website name ever, so just write it down.  C-C-T-A-K-E-S-T-E-P-S dot org.  That's letters C-C-T-A-K-E-S-T-E-P-S dot org. 
[01:02:00]  And you can go to the Long Island Walk and Sponsor, Team Devin, who's Rob's son.  And he's recovering, but it's a really good cause, and Rob's a great guy.  Yes.  Help him out and help his son out.  Rob is a pal and deserves the best.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  What's up, peeps?  Opie and Anthony.  The Hangover.  Hang on, Anthony. 
[01:02:30]  About the movie?  Well, the preview looked all right.  The Mike Tyson scene, singing in the air tonight or doing the drum solo.  Yeah, and then he cracks the guy in the face.  That is a huge laugh.  Well, The Hangover's doing very well as far as movie reviews go.  Is that Galifianakis in it as a comic?  I think so, yes, Jimmy.  Getting 81% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  I'm surprised by that.  I thought it would be one of those, you know, type of movies, but no. 
[01:03:00]  People are liking it so far.  And then Land of the Lost opens today.  Yes, I'm dying for that.  Chaka.  Yeah, he's cute.  Getting killed.  Getting killed in the press.  Why?  This is a great movie.  20% positive reviews.  Well, no shit.  That's one out of five like the movie.  One out of five.  And a bunch of negative Nellies not appreciating.  They go to this land.  They're lost.  There's Chaka.  There's Sleece Thacks.  There's a thing.  It's a little weird because we've had Danny McBride on the show a bunch of times. 
[01:03:30]  He ain't coming around.  Will Farrell.  He ain't coming around.  I have not seen him do any press for that movie.  And he calls our show when there's a movie coming out.  Yeah.  We weren't even offered those guys.  Are they doing any press here, Steve?  They have to be doing some.  Scroll.  No.  Yes, they're doing an interview on Foundry.  All right.  I'm done.  McBride got offered a stern and we got bypassed. 
[01:04:00]  I passed.  Why?  Publicist.  What are you talking about?  Publicist who we have had a relationship with a long time.  I don't know why.  We've been promoting.  Thanks for cast.  We've been promoting Danny McBride since he came on the scene.  I have been.  Foot fist away, my friends.  I have been emailing the publicist for the last three months to try to get Sasha Baron  Cohen, Will Farrell, Danny McBride, and everybody else that's attached to a summer movie that  this guy's got and we're getting bypassed. 
[01:04:30]  I don't know why.  With Sasha Baron Cohen?  Mm-hmm.  When's he coming in?  Well, he's not.  He's not.  He's not.  I don't think he's doing any press.  Will Farrell's not doing any.  A lot of these guys go straight to TV, but Danny's doing.  Straight to video.  Doing stern.  Okay, but Howard's not on today.  He's doing them at some other point.  He is booked on stern, though.  Yeah, but the movie starts today.  The movie opens Friday wide.  God, I don't get it, man.  Yeah.  I'll just never get it. 
[01:05:00]  He likes our show.  We've promoted a whole bunch of stuff.  It's not him, though.  Eastbound and down.  He may not even know that he's trying to get him on.  Exactly.  You don't get in contact with these guys directly.  I'm not.  The publicist.  I think Danny McBride's been on our show three times.  He did Eastbound and Down.  He came in for Foot Fist Way, sort of.  And then he also did the Ben Stiller.  Yeah, the museum.  No, no.  The other one.  The action movie.  Right, right, right.  What the fuck?  Tropic Thunder, right? 
[01:05:30]  Yes.  Yeah, Tropic Thunder.  We love that guy.  I still love him.  Whatever.  I mean.  It's not him making these decisions.  All right.  Yeah, the publicists are fucking so irritating.  So fucking irritating.  Why do we still have to fight this battle all these years later?  It's because that's the stupid.  This is the business we chose.  And then some of these people that are supposed to be in the know, they still think we're the  same guys that are sending people to have sex in churches.  Yeah.  How about you listen to the show?  We've updated it a little bit.  Yes, now we talk about how much liquid diarrhea could fill up a fucking studio. 
[01:06:00]  Period clots.  All right, good point.  How much cum would it take to fill the auditorium?  This is the new improvement.  Sure, I'll be an Anthony show.  We ask questions of milliliters and conversions to fucking pounds.  We're doing conversions and using math.  All right.  We were kind of wondering if we could swim through, you know, clots.  All right.  Well.  Makes the math fun for kids.  What about our Breitbart?  Breitbart.  Epic tax rant.  Let's not forget.  Okay. 
[01:06:30]  NBA it?  Finals?  Yeah.  What do you got on that?  I was watching a little of that last night.  No work.  No.  I actually was.  It was on at the hotel bar.  Oh, really?  I had dinner over there at the hotel bar.  What happened last night?  Well, the NBA finals is a complete bust because, you know, the NBA needed LeBron James, and  LeBron James failed miserably.  And now it's the Lakers and the Magic, and it's not even a contest.  Yeah.  First game goes to the Lakers, 100 to 75.  Kobe Bryant, 40 points.  It's going to be just a massacre. 
[01:07:00]  I was watching Kobe taking some foul shots with them tattoos of his.  All the players are tatted up.  Yeah, but it's just that whole curse.  The curse of the black man.  You know, they want to get tats.  And it just winds up looking like, um, you can't see him.  Sorry, you just can't see what the hell Kobe has tattooed on himself.  Just get, like, white ink.  Or yellow ink.  What are you doing with the dark ink?  White ink is supposed to be very difficult to use. 
[01:07:30]  That's why you never see it on tattoos.  Why?  Because it's very difficult to actually get it in there and hold its pigment.  But it's ink.  It looks bad, too.  It looks bad.  Let me see Kobe's tattoos.  He's got a lot of them.  Now, see, that doesn't look that bad.  It looks like they did something with the contrast there.  No.  I always thought Kobe's tattoos were very noticeable and all right.  I think it might be talking about other guys, maybe?  Well, I have gotten basketball players wrong, but those are the tats I saw last night.  Oh, go to that last picture.  That's more like the way I saw it. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, like that.  Look, see?  That's more like what I was looking at.  It's all blended in, kind of.  You've got a strain.  It feels like you're looking through, like, bad glasses.  It looks like an old sailor's tattoo from, like, years ago.  Another thing is the artists, too, because those aren't – I wouldn't call those good tattoos by any stretch of the imagination.  Kobe got bad ink?  Yeah, they don't look so great to me at all.  I think he would get the best.  All the NBA players, not all, but a lot of them have the neck tattoos. 
[01:08:30]  How are they going to get another job after their career is over?  You know, when you go in for an interview after your career is over.  So the NBA Finals, not even worth watching.  That's a bust.  Everyone knows it.  It was supposed to be LeBron versus Kobe.  When I saw it, it was, like, 55-79 or something like that.  79-55.  And even I knew.  One team seems to be beating the other quite badly.  It's over, Johnny. 
[01:09:00]  Stanley Cup Finals, anything?  What do you got on that?  How are the Penguins doing?  They came back.  They did come back.  Yes.  Tied the series.  Wow.  It's now 2-2.  Wow.  Go Penguins.  Go Penguins.  I know we have a lot of fans in Detroit, but I'm sorry.  It's all about the Penguins.  Fuck the stupid octopus.  And then Randy Johnson, who pitched for the Yankees for, what, a year?  Two years?  Oh, he was good.  Him and his shitty back.  He was terrific here in New York.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  He sure could work that disabled list.  He was great.  And he loved giving fans pictures.  Right, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  He was really good.  I forgot what a douchebag he was.  Still one of my favorite celebrity stories ever.  Another Yankee jerk-off.  Another jerk-off who played for the Yankees.  Well, he got his 300th win there, Jimmy.  That's good.  And they're saying that could be the last time that happens.  Yeah, they don't pitch as much, right?  Yeah.  I mean, the rotation is ridiculous now.  Yeah.  I mean, we'd have to get, like, a sports guy to explain it. 
[01:10:00]  I just know it's kind of ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  I don't understand it.  You don't get many 20-game winners.  Yeah, a lot of these pitchers are in for about three, four innings, and then they pull them out.  It's crazy.  How do I get it?  And how many years ago did Ronald Reagan die?  Eleven.  Yes.  I think this will surprise you.  Does it seem like yesterday?  Surprise you?  Twelve.  No? 
[01:10:30]  Wow.  All right.  How long?  Five.  To me, it seems like it's, like, you fucked up the bit.  I didn't do any math.  I should have done some subtraction.  No, it seems like it was, like, two years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  It's already five years that he passed.  Yeah.  And Nancy was being escorted by, you know, the military guy.  That must have been, uh, that must have been something for, uh, Reagan to look down on.  Hmm.  Yeah, from heaven.  Escorted by, oh, you mean Obama, right? 
[01:11:00]  No.  Oh, I thought you were talking about when he let her into the White House.  Oh, no, that just happened this week.  Yeah, yeah.  No, and, uh.  Oh, my goodness, what's she doing?  You don't think Reagan would have been a fan of Obama?  Um, nah, probably not.  I don't think so, either.  I think they thought very differently.  He would have thought Obama was a very weak leader just because of his foreign policy.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's the answer, Jimmy.  Jimmy, what do you got on Sterling?  You said, uh, something's going on with Sterling.  Daily News is just a good article, and they say that it's almost fun to listen to if you 
[01:11:30]  like to cringe because, uh, they say he barely tolerates Susan Wall.  Susan Wall, man!  She sounds like Ted if he was from Boston.  But, John, I'm telling you, bro!  We got you, Susan.  You love the Yankees.  It does.  They got the strangest sports announcers, the Yankees, because they do have the famous  Susan Wall.  Everyone knows her from our show.  Oh, of course.  You know, the famous, uh, blocks, clips.  I don't know where they are.  And then you got Sterling that's trying to make it about himself.  That's what the article's about. 
[01:12:00]  It is, huh?  How he is trying to make it about himself.  You've been saying that for years.  It's ridiculous.  And they just kill him?  Yeah, because, you know what?  It's fucking, it is embarrassing.  Um, easy cat, man.  It's because, uh, not enough data, Starchild.  Uh, Starchild?  With a stupid New York accent.  I know.  Um, yes, Gene growling.  All right, we get it.  It's, uh...  It's always about him, and he's trying to throw his fucking catchphrases in there, and it 
[01:12:30]  just sounds terrible.  It sounds terrible.  And they're killing him for it.  They're saying he makes too many mistakes during the game, too, which I really never noticed.  Really?  It blows calls?  Like, I love when he calls a game.  I just hate when he makes it about himself.  It's embarrassing.  Yeah, I don't think sports announcers should be doing that.  No.  A little catchphrase, maybe, you know.  Yeah.  But not every single home run.  Every single good play.  Yeah, why?  It was 11-2.  11-2, right? 
[01:13:00]  What are you excited about?  Yeah, nice walk-off home run.  Then, you know, now you can, the Yankees win, but after a nice, long, boring blowout  of a game, who cares?  See, at the end of the broadcast, they're saying goodnight.  Goodbye, self-centered ass.  Goodnight, cunt.  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen...  Ever.  Not in the top 50.  Now, look...  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  They're like cartoon characters, these two.  You know, it's fantastic. 
[01:13:30]  Now, in hindsight, think back at that moment.  Which one?  That she's talking about and describing as if it's the greatest, hugest thing that has  ever happened in Yankee history.  Are you surprised everybody with the Roger Clemens announcement?  With Roger Clemens saying that it's coming back.  From George Steinbrenner's box.  No one knew that was going down.  What a fucking bust.  Another clusterfuck move by the Yankees.  And the way she's talking, and now, in hindsight,  it's, you know, what, a year, over a year later. 
[01:14:00]  And she just...  Now it sounds so silly that she's so exuberant over this.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious!  Screaming.  She's getting mad at the production people.  You hear her, like, snapping at them behind the scenes.  Yeah, like, this is a moment.  Yeah, this is a moment.  I have a moment.  I hate the goodness gracious, because you know she should have said holy shit.  Yeah.  I hate when people do that.  Goodness gracious.  You want to say holy shit, so just say it. 
[01:14:30]  Don't believe it.  Goodness gracious.  Who says goodness gracious when you could say holy shit?  Holy shit!  Mother of God!  She couldn't.  Now you know who's going to fill the last spot in the rotation, John!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  Do you have the rest of it?  The last spot in the rotation!  My favorite part is...  Posada...  Yeah, my...  No, my favorite part is actually Clemens.  Oh.  Oh.  Look at this great moment. 
[01:15:00]  Oh.  Gonna see you all real soon.  Fucking worst speech ever.  I've seen people about to be hanged to give better speeches.  It's fucking awful.  Lou Gehrig had her...  Lou Gehrig had a speech!  Yeah, that was a speech.  Luckiest man!  This asshole's standing up half drunk in Steinbrenner's shitty luxury box while his car's being fucking broken into in the South Bronx.  Watching him drooling.  Yeah.  Steinbrenner fucking...  Do we have the whole clip, Travis?  Come see you real soon! 
[01:15:30]  Now, I have like a 19-second version, but it doesn't have...  It seems like it's the middle, because it doesn't have Clemens, and then it doesn't have her talking about how Pettit knew...  Where's the full version?  Oh, come on.  I'm looking for it.  Pettit knew.  E-Rock will get it.  Yeah, it's in the...  Can our producer tell us where the full version of this is, please?  I'm sure it's on the website.  The Yankee dugout.  I see a big chunk of Gatorade.  Yeah.  And he's got a...  One guy was grinning.  The one guy knew.  It was the most...  It sounded like one of fucking Mary Tyler Moore's parties. 
[01:16:00]  There's nothing going on.  Fucking Clemens.  Hey, y'all.  Be there real soon.  Oh, my God.  Is this true?  I haven't been to Yankee Stadium yet.  I really want to go to Shea Stadium.  The new Shea Stadium.  I know it's called City Field.  City Field.  I need to go to City Field.  Meet the Mets.  Greet the Mets.  Best line ever.  Step right up and play golf with the Mets.  They got knocked out when you're handsome. 
[01:16:30]  They blew a big lead and played golf with the Mets.  Yeah, the big joke.  Tommy, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, boy?  Tommy.  I did go to the New Yankee Stadium.  City Field's beautiful, too.  But the new Yankee Stadium was fantastic.  Except when you go into the bathroom, they're piping Sterling and Waldman.  I don't know if you've ever seen Susan Waldman.  She looks like a muppet.  I'm finding your dick while taking a piss when Susan Waldman's talking in your ear.  Yeah.  Freaking impossible.  That's the only problem.  Other than that, it's freaking awesome. 
[01:17:00]  I hear the new stadium is...  Because, you know, the Mets and the Yankees both have a new stadium this year.  I hear that Yankee Stadium is just overwhelming.  Yeah.  And that the new stadium for the Mets is more manageable.  Like, brand new, cool as shit.  Both of them are cool as shit.  But they say Yankee Stadium is just overwhelming.  My friend Sean has really good seats at the stadium.  I'm going to go to a game this year.  I do want to go see.  Braggard.  That's my friend.  It's not me. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  You're going.  I might.  Braggard.  I'll have to find a good weekend.  When they're playing the Twins from Minnesota.  I always say the name of the city last.  Hey.  When will the Marlins in Florida be here, Gregory?  I'm a big sports fan.  That's a stupid way to put it.  It's not.  The Yankees of New York are doing quite well.  I understand there's been many homers.  Randy Johnson.  Yeah.  There's a guy walking around with a briefcase and a suit looking very serious. 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  He's a dildo salesman.  He has a case full of dildos.  Flavored.  Different shapes.  Ones with nails to throw them.  What the hell is that about?  He's pointing a lot.  Well, where's he pointing?  Probably the back of someone's pants.  This could go right here.  Hood of the guy's mouth.  He could hold one here or hold one there.  Carry two at a time.  You'll love my product. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, she said no to us, too.  Who's that?  Denise Richards.  Richards.  So what does she have?  She's a fucking, what does she do?  Reality show.  I'm saying, who cares about her?  Or is it Richard's cock?  Is it Richardson or Richards?  I always forget Richard's.  Travis found the clip.  Oh, really?  Yeah, Travis.  Thank you all.  Well, they came and got me out of Texas.  And I can tell you, it's a privilege to be back.  I'll be talking to you all soon. 
[01:19:00]  Roger Clemens is in George's box.  And Roger Clemens is coming back.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things, of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, Roger Clemens standing  right in George Steinbrenner's box announcing he is back.  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  And there we go, John.  You don't have to worry about who's going to take that spot in the rotation. 
[01:19:30]  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  Big size.  Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  Attention fans.  He is here.  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place in the rotation.  Fast forward.  He went, what, 7-20 or something?  I'll be talking to you soon from my hospital bed.  Saying my back hurts.  And I'm a worthless bag of Texas shit who apparently likes to fuck young country singers. 
[01:20:00]  And then I'll deny steroid use, even though my ex-trainer has fucking five pounds of my  skin with a bunch of needles and photos and video of me shooting it.  Fucking asshole.  Thanks for nothing, shit dick.  And downs of my blood in his refrigerator.  Yeah, it's awful.  Jesus.  He has my old trainer.  I should have known when he would only see me at night and he slept in a coffin.  Clemens is a fucking dope.  That fucking...  When he's just like, I'm talking to you real soon. 
[01:20:30]  Oh my God!  Yeah.  It's one of the best clips ever because she starts with her goodness gracious and then  she covers the mic.  Don't cut.  Don't cut.  She says, I think I'm going to school someone.  This is her moment.  Don't ruin my moment.  And she's ready to say good God.  Yeah.  She's ready to go, good God!  And then she goes, goodness gracious!  Oh wow, is that great.  That clip is fan-fucking-tastic.  Posada's smiling and Pettit knew.  Yeah.  The Jackie dug out.  She makes it sound like it's just bedlam going on. 
[01:21:00]  Pettit knew line.  When you know something, aren't you going to tell the rest of the guys?  Yeah.  So basically everyone knew that Roger Clemens was going to make an appearance that day.  You don't think he was kind of wandering around like, what, they hit him?  Clemens finished the 2007 season with a record of 6-6 and a 4.15 ERA.  One-year deal?  $28 million.  To win six games.  Good move, asshole Yankees.  What a dumb organization.  Six games.  Six games. 
[01:21:30]  $28 million.  Dude, you understand, you could have handed me $1 million.  I would have saved you $27 million and only lost six more games than he did.  Exactly.  I could have went 0-12 and saved you $27 million, you fucking assholes.  How weird is that?  That would have been a good business decision.  That's a good move is to put Jimmy on the mound.  For half the money.  Of course.  They would have had a, oh, those erratic things.  Oh, Gina's getting a sign in a picture.  Larritz is drunk and hitting someone.  Oh, shit. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, shit.  Corey Lytle as well.  Yeah, yeah.  Corey Lytle's trying to eject through the dining room.  Holy shit.  Of all the dramatic things, and Billy Morton is in Steinbrenner's windshield.  Joe Peppertone is rolling up on a Steinbrenner's dollar bills.  Shut up, Susan.  Fucking gung-ho idiot. 
[01:22:30]  Fucking shut your mouth.  Yeah, even Cluckett wasn't excited.  No, he wasn't.  What about him?  In the middle of his thing, he didn't know what to say.  He's just like, oh, duh.  Thurman Munster's on fire.  You forgot Thurman.  God damn it.  Holy shit.  She should have been honest.  Of all the dramatic things, this is number 4,275 on the list.  Right behind when I painted my clit with paint thinner. 
[01:23:00]  Luke Eric is frozen in time.  Of all the dramatic things, and Pettit's smiling.  Luke Eric is hobbling around like an asshole.  Babe Ruth has nothing to say because they took his voice box years ago.  Babe Ruth is talking.  He's cheering with his cancer kazoo.  What other horrific Yankee story can we explore for this? 
[01:23:30]  Hey, a little trivia on Randy Johnson.  He got his 300th win.  What else did he do?  Big cock.  Big cock.  Big Adam's apple.  Very good.  Long fingers.  Tiny head.  Bad mustache.  Yes.  Deny Jim Norton of a picture.  Yes, he did, and he lumbered off a fucking giant building with a mustache.  Pictures in Jim Norton's book.  Wait, that's my picture.  Oh my God.  You fucking got to give me money for that.  Wait, before you sue Jimmy.  I'm fucking suing you, brother. 
[01:24:00]  Sue everyone.  My fucking picture.  Punitive damage is here.  Wow.  I'm a published photographer.  Yeah.  You are.  And a bestseller.  God damn.  Nice.  Right.  I don't know if he's the only pitcher to do this.  I'm not sure.  But he did something that's pretty remarkable.  Besides the 300.  I think I know.  Banged his head on this roof of the Astrodome.  You'd have to be very tall, James.  Certainly would.  Killed a bird with a pitch.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, was he that guy?  Yes.  I think he did that.  He destroyed the bird, right?  Oh, fuck it.  Bird came apart.  Holy shit.  That's how a bird laughs.  He's chirping at you, man.  He's tweeting at you.  What are the odds of that?  Probably two to one.  Hey, there's my famous picture, motherfucker.  Give me some money, Jimmy.  I gave you money.  Look at that lumbering idiot.  Oh.  Goes up to that fucking light pole and does some chin-ups.  It's just the worst. 
[01:25:00]  How great would it be if a low-flying plane just decapitated him?  Creep.  And I love that part of the reason he didn't take a picture with you is because he didn't  want to get recognized.  He's being recognized the entire time he walked down the street.  Just for being a tall guy.  Right.  You don't have to know who he is.  You'd look at him and just go like, oh, my God.  You'd be gawking at him.  Every tall guy is somebody.  You know that, right?  Yes.  This is, we'll give Eric a little time today.  Eric in Colorado.  What do you got?  Hey, morning, boys.  Welcome aboard.  The other thing that Randy Johnson is famous for is on the way to making his 300th victory, 
[01:25:30]  he beat every MLB team.  The only pitcher to ever do it.  Oh, so at some point he's beaten every team.  That's pretty impressive.  Is he the only pitcher?  That's what they were reporting on SportsCenter last night.  Got to give him credit on that one.  Years before the Yankees got him.  Yeah.  Yes, he got most of the wins before the Yankees.  Yeah, yeah.  Very nice.  Thank you, sir.  Sure.  We got Puddle of AIDS writing, Jim Abbott is in a pool swimming in a circle?  God damn, Jim Abbott. 
[01:26:00]  I forgot about that.  Old wants to do patty cakes but can't.  That stupid shoved the glove under his stinky armpit.  It's awful.  If you're happy and you know it, nod.  He would just shove it under his stump.  The glove to field the ball.  That is an amazing story.  What an amazing athlete, though.  I mean, to throw the ball and then fucking pick the glove up and be ready to field.  It was fast, man.  He could do it so fast.  You know, there's another one-armed athlete that it was just in the news maybe two weeks 
[01:26:30]  ago and he got recruited.  A basketball player got recruited and he only has one arm.  One-armed basketball player?  Really?  Maybe we can find the story.  That's unbelievable.  I played a few games of hoops in my day.  How the fuck do you get recruited with one arm in basketball?  All right, that stopped the show.  I was pondering it, trying to think of a good slot machine joke, but nothing.  Yeah, we got nothing. 
[01:27:00]  We'll find the story, but we got Mike Francesca doing a little meltdown.  Francesca.  Francesca, sorry.  What a pompous douche he is.  Glad I got away from that asshole.  He's on in my gym all the time.  He's the worst.  I hate seeing him on TV.  He's a bore.  He's terrible.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  He does a TV show, right?  Doesn't even acknowledge that the TV cameras are on once.  No?  It's like...  He does acknowledge it, though, because he wears the little headsets that don't touch 
[01:27:30]  his hair.  Oh, well, he wants to make sure the hair looks good.  God, that looks silly.  He puts that glove on his stump.  It doesn't look that bad.  And then...  He figured that out.  There goes the pitch.  And he puts that glove on.  How the fuck?  He caught...  That guy hit right back to him, and he was ready in a split second to make that play.  How does he...  He put the glove on, caught a ball that was hit to the mound, and then got the glove off. 
[01:28:00]  Got the ball in his hand, and threw it to first.  Plenty of time, too, by the way.  This was 93 that he threw his no-hitter?  That's 16 years ago that fucking Stumpy did this?  Stumpy threw a no-hitter?  Yes, he did.  One of the most amazing things an athlete's ever done, I think.  Oh, is that it?  Was this the...  Keith?  Yeah, that's the no-hitter.  Yeah, Chuck Knoblox in the corner, twitching and twitching and washing his hands.  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  Pettit's grinning from ear to ear.  Chuck Knoblox trying to repress molestation memories.  Puts it out.  Bob O'Heehan is on Steinbrenner's talk.  Oh, God damn it.  I can't...  Yeah, if you do instant feedback from a cell phone, pop your name on there, so you get a little credit.  Is this the one-armed basketball player, Dan?  Yeah.  Who recruited him? 
[01:29:00]  Harvey Milk!  He's accepted a scholarship to play for Manhattan College next season.  Oh, boo.  A scholarship?  I feel bad for him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It is kind of...  When he defends, it looks like no one wants to get near that nasty stump.  He just puts it in your face and you're like, ah!  His left arm looks like an unclipped cock.  It does!  Because it's like his hand has a foreskin over it.  It's awful.  Peel it back and his fingers show up. 
[01:29:30]  He could dock with other people with the same affliction.  Is it more amazing to play basketball with one arm or baseball?  Baseball.  Baseball.  Why baseball?  Abbott never had a hit.  You could absolutely...  Well, yeah, he did have to hit, but not when he made it to the major.  You could dribble and shoot with one hand.  Yeah, but you could never go to your left.  All right, but to have to pitch and put a glove on and field...  All you've got to do is make three rights.  Oh, well...  And you do his free throws.  It's just you and the hoop.  So you think Abbott, one-armed Abbott, more impressive than one-armed basketball player. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, because he's pitching.  To be able to...  You know, you're 90 feet away.  He puts the glove on, fields, takes the glove off, throws to first before an athlete gets to first base.  All right, but this basketball player, right?  He gets the ball.  He throws it.  He misses.  He hits.  Who cares?  The other team, all they have to do is move completely to one side of the court.  And now what is he going to do?  He's fucked.  He can't dribble to his left.  Well, let's see what he does.  He's fucked.  He probably turns around, dribbles backwards. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Perhaps he has the type of ball that Curly Neal used to have.  And he throws it, and there's a string on it.  A string on it.  They allow that, right?  I don't know.  Do you want to...  Oh, wow.  We can't do alleged Yankee bits.  Oh, no.  Getting some good ones?  Oh, boy.  Without saying the player, what's the allegation?  Rape.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Let's just...  The whole organization to the fans?  Why don't we go with Doug in New Jersey? 
[01:31:00]  Doug?  DiMaggio smacking Monroe?  Yeah.  Not much of a delivery there.  That's very good.  And Posada's gritted, and Marilyn won until Joe Smith came in three of her molars.  Joe's drinking psycho.  Even if you can't do the Susan Wallman, you got to try.  It just makes it funnier.  Yeah, of course.  Dan on Long Island.  And John Rocker is putting on his pointed hook. 
[01:31:30]  What'd he say?  John Rocker is putting on his pointed hook.  Goodness gracious!  Of all the...  Andy Pettit knew, and I forgot which player I was going to say.  Goddamn the thought of me.  Played soccer with a girl with one arm.  That's easy.  She has one leg.  Call us back.  Yeah.  Well, speaking of one leg, let's go to Joe in New York.  Joe?  Joe, there's a kid.  I got it on an email about six months ago.  He plays Little League, probably eight years old. 
[01:32:00]  He hops around and runs to first and plays the field all on one leg.  Wait, did they give him a spatula foot?  Say again?  They didn't give him a spatula foot?  Ouch.  No, no.  He's got nothing.  Just the one leg.  It'll make everybody but Anthony cry.  Those spatula feet are pretty good for walking and running and sporting it.  I love what he said at the end.  It'll make everybody but Anthony cry.  Oh, yeah.  I caught that.  All right.  Would you use that guy's controller, Danny? 
[01:32:30]  No.  Danny's showing us a video of somebody playing a little PlayStation, or what is he playing?  Xbox?  Yeah.  No.  When I used to go to the arcade when I was a kid, there was a guy that would go, and he  would show up there, and he had whatever mask, whatever that was.  Oh, yeah.  He had that.  And I remember he was playing Lethal Enforcers, and for the rest of my days, I'd never played  that Lethal Enforcers machine because I didn't want to touch it.  You don't want to get that.  No, who wants to look like Mask?  It's contagious.  It really is.  Why would they let him touch things? 
[01:33:00]  I know.  If he sits next to you on a plane, the next thing you know, your head is big, and you have  a fucking pinless map.  And a blind girl whose family just fucking throws her in a closet so she can't see you.  That was fantastic when the parents were there.  I want you to meet, what was his name, Rocky?  Rocky Dennis.  I want you to meet Rocky.  The parents are like, hi.  They're looking around, the retarded, big-headed fucking douche looking for Rocky.  Like, where is he?  And then when they realize it's him, oh, brother. 
[01:33:30]  Where's Rocky?  Is he standing behind this Easter Island statue?  Daryl Strawberry.  Oh, oh, yeah, there you go.  Daryl Strawberry.  Mickey Mantle.  Oh, that's what I meant to say.  Just giving you some thought starters, Jimmy.  A few thought starters.  All right.  Wrestler, what do you want to do?  Wrestler from Arizona State has one leg?  A one-armed wrestler.  The listeners are going with the amputee thing.  That's kind of hard to do.  You need that leg for balance. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive.  If you're covering someone, they could grab your balls easier.  We're done with the one-armed baseball players.  We've got a lot of those coming in.  And, yes, I'll acknowledge that Abbott obviously made the major leagues with one-arm.  I'm just saying one-armed baseball player or one-armed basketball player.  Wow, that's the one-legged dude.  How does he balance?  How much is that?  That's got to be so easy to tip him over.  He's a three-legged fucking table.  Can he roll out of some shit, though, too, because he only has one leg? 
[01:34:30]  Probably.  Only one less thing to guard against fucking being tapped out.  How great would just a torso be to wrestle?  There is one.  I swear to God, I think there's a guy with no legs who wrestles, and he has arms.  I'm almost positive.  No, I'm saying no arms or legs, and just he loses every match.  Everyone beats the shit out of him.  You just have to grab him and throw him down, and with one finger on his chest,  pin him.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  He can't move.  And the coach is always like, put your head down. 
[01:35:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah, they're all encouraging him.  We should give up and just get a job as an anchor.  Yeah, exactly.  He's 0-61.  He lost to the cleanup lady.  Oh, Sean.  She just kicked him over and put her foot on the back of his dumb head.  Sean in Atlanta.  Sean.  Hey, Jimmy.  The guy you're talking about, Kyle Maynard, I've grappled against him in competition  before.  He has nothing past.  He was born with nothing past his elbows and knees, and he pushes those things against 
[01:35:30]  you.  The one that feels like you're getting stabbed because they're sharp as hell.  Wow.  It hurt.  But it's just the disgust.  It'd be like sticks on the side of your cheek or something.  It looks like somebody trying to get away from a monster.  That's what I'm looking at here.  The fucking guy has no legs.  He's got his arms wrapped around the guy's midsection, and the guy is going, ah!  He sort of has just little stubby legs. 
[01:36:00]  Yes.  Thumps.  The cut is way above his knee.  Also, the wrestler you're talking about is, he's an Abu Dhabi qualifier for grappling  and all that.  He is a very good wrestler.  Submission guy.  Well, also, he's wearing an orange, the floor is kind of orange, he's wearing an orange  jumpsuit.  It looks like T-1000 is wrestling.  He's just coming out of the floor, yeah.  He's coming out of the floor.  You know, we just fought MMA not too long, yeah.  Huh?  How about that?  MMA?  Mom, I'm missing my arms. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  Yeah, we got pictures.  Did the guy do well?  Oh, we lost him.  I hope not.  This one I know of.  Hopefully Adele threw him into the eighth row.  You're about to see the greatest video ever.  This one I know.  Jason, go ahead.  A football player, high school football player, no legs, plays defense, and just makes a big  pile right in the middle.  What?  You got to see the video of the no-legged football player.  This cannot be true.  Oh, I've seen him.  It's unbelievable. 
[01:37:00]  What do they call him?  The ball?  They punt him through.  What?  Come on, that's just stupid.  You got to see him move.  Is there any videos of him?  I'll take a leg.  You got to see this kid move with no legs.  Why would you look at him and go, we need him on our team?  He uses his arms like his legs.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  He cannot chase somebody down.  He how strong his arms must be?  He plays, I think, on the front line.  He's got to be a line.  Yeah, so all he does is grab you by your legs, and that's all he has to really do.  He plays nose tackle. 
[01:37:30]  Nose tackle.  Thank you, sir.  You probably can't even feel good about yourself.  Imagine the guy that does run over him for the whole game.  It's like, how good about yourself can you feel?  Got through you.  We're looking for the video.  Thanks, Jason.  Let me say hi to Bo.  I think it's Bo.  Bo or Bob?  Bo.  It's Bo.  Hey, happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thanks a lot, Bo.  All right, hold on, hold on, because now we're going to be distracted.  We found the video.  Bo, stand by.  Is this the guy?  Yeah.  I think so, yeah.  Is this the guy?  How many fucking no-legged football players are out there? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, no, Dan, this guy's just short.  What is he doing?  He's horrifying these children.  These look like little kids.  They do look like kids.  Oh, yeah, that's the little, the other league.  Maybe it's just a whole montage of his whole football career.  It's fucking weird.  Look at all these all-American privileged kids.  Oh, what is he?  What do you mean, what is he?  I think it's a different guy.  His nationality.  His nationality.  I don't know.  Oh, maybe.  No, I don't know.  Looks like M. Night Shyamalan. 
[01:38:30]  And the handoff.  That might be a different guy.  It is.  See, Dan, I'm sorry.  There's another no-legged football player out there.  Bo, what do you got?  Yeah, there's a guy on the pro fishing tour with no arms.  And I want to say he's got no legs, too.  And there's video of it on YouTube.  He's got no arms, no legs, and is on the pro fishing tour.  He shoves his face in the water.  Pulls him out with his teeth.  No, he has a worm in his mouth where he puts his dick in when they nibble on his dick. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, sorry.  I apologize.  I didn't mean to jump in with some humor.  All right, give out his website.  Go ahead.  Apologize.  But there's a video of it on YouTube.  You can find it.  Anyway, punch it out, boys.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You do that.  Well, it goes on and on.  Fantastic.  Here's Mike Francesa flipping out.  Mike?  I'm saying he's a 22-year-old kid.  It's funny how you have all this patience with Hughes, who has a 70 RA.  But Jabba's... 
[01:39:30]  Hughes is a starter!  Alex!  Basically, Jabba has to pitch like Pedro Martinez.  Alex, wait a second.  Jabba, wait a second.  Alex, how many...  What's Jabba's ERA this year?  Wait, it was 3-7 going into last night.  So what, maybe 3-8, 3-9 right now?  3-9.  Wait, wait.  Wait a second.  Andy Pettit is a starting pitcher!  Andy Pettit?  Andy Pettit's a starting pitcher who's won almost 200 games.  What are you talking about?  If Andy Pettit goes sixth inning...  Andy Pettit can't pitch the... 
[01:40:00]  It's a miracle.  Hey, Alex, Andy Pettit can't pitch the eighth inning!  Hey, get rid of him.  Get rid of him.  Give me the Jabba stats for his career.  I'll teach Alex a lesson here.  And show you the difference in his statistics since he's gone from being a relief pitcher to a starting pitcher.  Why bring up Andy Pettit?  He can't pitch the eighth inning?  Andy Pettit?  What does Andy Pettit, at the end of his career, after being a starting pitcher for 15 years, have to do with this? 
[01:40:30]  Andy Pettit.  What a grump.  What a douchebag.  Get rid of him.  Why?  Why?  Because it was good radio?  Get off my phone, you Spacheme!  Andy Pettit!  What a dick.  That picture of the legless football player looks exactly like somebody that transported in, halfway in and out of the ground.  He beamed down with the wrong coordinates.  Looks like he's wasted. 
[01:41:00]  Why would you plant one of those?  Or he just looks like he's standing there and refusing to move for 20,000 years.  Oh, fantastic.  That is a great picture.  That's a really good picture.  Who doesn't love Windows?  All right, why don't we take a break?  Yeah.  I'll send the error report.  It'll get back to me on that, I'm sure.  Love when Windows gives you that option. 
[01:41:30]  Send error report?  Don't send.  Yeah, let me send that.  Yeah, send it.  Some guy's sitting in fucking Seattle, just going like, oh, one's in.  Error report.  Yeah, all right.  It comes down to one of those vacuum tubes.  Yeah.  Vroom, vroom.  All right, well, this is Anthony Cumia here.  It seems to be having...  All right, we'll get right back to him.  A waste of time.  It's like that button that is supposed to change the light so you can cross the street.  It's just something to do, to take your mind off the fact that you're pissed. 
[01:42:00]  Stupid Windows.  When we get back, Lady Gaga talks about cock.  Impossible.  She talks about cock.  The cock?  The cock.  Right.  Also, backstage with ONA, Kenny's mashup demo was reviewed.  The one we played yesterday.  Oh, was it?  So that keeps that going.  Ooh.  And other things.  But first, let's take a look at the FU line. 
[01:42:30]  Friday.  Friday.  Ogby Anthony.  Old Jimmy Norton.  By the way, Jimmy Norton is killing this week.  Of course he is.  The Andy Rooney from yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We got backstage with ONA.  Kenny's mashup demo reviewed. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  So I had a cancer scare.  I guess I should talk about it for like a few minutes and then we'll move on.  Yeah.  How about that?  I got a fucking text from Anthony last night.  I'm in a gas station.  You're at a gas station?  I'm in a gas station on my way to do a set.  And it said something about what was open with cancer.  And I'm like, I don't know.  Well, I guess I'm bringing it to the show because I think a lot of people go through this.  And I got really good news yesterday. 
[01:43:30]  And unfortunately, people don't get the good news.  But it's the whole system that I'm really frustrated with.  By the way, family members are hearing this for the first time.  So, you know, I basically didn't tell anyone.  I told like one brother.  And my girl.  I understand that.  Like medical matters, like, yeah, you kind of want to be private with them.  That's cool.  But I kind of wish we could have gotten a call before Twitter.  So I would have been prepared for that.  Oh, you know what?  I probably should have done that.  You think?  You know what?  You're right.  The guys you work with every day who are your friends?  You know what?  You're right.  But I didn't even call my mom or my brother. 
[01:44:00]  So I'm a real asshole.  I just realized I'm a real asshole.  You're 100% right.  Twitter gets it first.  Not that you shouldn't Twitter it.  But it's like you kind of want to feel like you were in the know before the Twitter community was.  Well, you know what happened was.  Me and Big A found out together.  You know what happened?  Who?  Who?  What happened was word got out in the inner inner circle that we got great news in my family, meaning me and my girl.  So everyone assumed right away, oh, my God, she's pregnant.  So they're calling the house. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And then I know how that stuff spreads.  So I'm like, oh, my God, I got to now talk about what the great news is because I wasn't even going to say anything.  Yeah.  But now we have some explaining to do.  So then, you know, I made a couple of phone calls and I'm like, you know what?  I'll just squash this by doing a little tweet.  I'm an idiot.  A little tweet.  Instead of like, yeah, some schmuck that listens to us in Iowa found out before you guys.  See, but you say that now and it's like, oh, okay, that's cool.  That's the type of thing I would have done. 
[01:45:00]  But I heard that.  I was actually offended last night.  I'm like, why wouldn't he tell us?  Does he really hate us?  We're his friends.  Oh, you know what, Jimmy?  I feel like an idiot.  Honestly, my, wow, no.  I mean, I got to be serious for a minute.  I was, I've been out of my mind for a couple of months.  I wasn't thinking right.  Okay.  Because, yeah, that's so stupid now that I, now.  My feelings were all hurt.  I'm like, yeah.  I don't want it to be about me.  It's like, I found out my friend doesn't have cancer.  I should be very happy instead of feeling wounded.  Like, why did he tell me?  But I should have never had to feel like I had cancer.  That's the point I'm getting at.  You know, I, I, I brought the one thing to the show. 
[01:45:30]  I injured my, uh, my testicle boxing.  When you get a little older, I know we like to play that we're younger than we are.  But when you, when you get, when you get a little older and you're still working out,  it's very important to support the ballies.  That's right.  And don't box short people.  That's a bunch of right in the sack.  And I learned the, the hard way because, uh, I kind of like fucked up my testicle.  It's all good.  It's a hundred percent now, but it was really painful and it got inflamed and all sorts 
[01:46:00]  of shit.  So I went to a urologist cause, cause I, I didn't even realize I injured it like boxing.  Very injured.  I didn't realize that.  Cause what happened was it was bouncy bouncing and stretching and the bungee cord stretched a  little too much.  Oh, Anthony hates this talk.  I hate, wait till you hear the ending of this story.  All I'm thinking of is how people have, you must have big balls.  I do all right down there.  You must have a fucking big bag.  I do all right.  I do all right.  So, uh, I didn't even realize that I injured it at the time, but it was really sensitive. 
[01:46:30]  So I went to a urologist and he goes, all right, we're, we're putting you through all  the tests.  Cause, so I go in there and now he's hinting, huh?  Maybe, maybe, maybe testicular cancer.  Like what?  So, uh, I, I got all the tests for a testicular cancer and everything came back.  Perfect.  Okay.  He goes, well, you know, I also want to check your, uh, your prostate.  I'm like, all right, here we go again.  I want to say, look, but I don't have strep throat linger longer.  Uh, you take a finger up the ass and you go home. 
[01:47:00]  Well, that's what happened with my old doctor strep throat.  Next thing you know, I got a finger on my ass.  I'm like, what the fuck is, uh, with these doctors wanting their fingers on my ass?  So I, um, so I bent over and, and now it's so awkward when that happens, I was ready to  turn around and try to diffuse the whole situation with a joke or something.  I turn around getting ready to say something and I see it in his face and he does this every  day.  I'm like, Oh fuck.  Cause you got a lump.  What do you mean?  I got a lump.  And immediately I'm starting to think Frank Zappa. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, cause Zappa, yeah, that's how he went out and he was young.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Basically saying it's very rare for someone of my age to have prostate cancer, but it does  happen.  But Zappa never went to the doctor either.  He was like notorious for not going to the doctor.  He hated going to the doctor.  So he, he probably just let shit get out of hand.  Yeah.  You can't let that shit get out of hand.  Cause even if I did have it, God forbid it was, it was treatable.  He, he, he told me it would be stage two.  Out of stage four.  I don't know. 
[01:48:00]  Three is bad.  Out of two stages.  Yeah.  Whoops.  I think stage two means you could feel, feel the tumors.  I think.  And three means it's just, it's spreading.  And four is like, Jesus, get a priest, but, uh, yes, good luck, bro.  Yeah.  So, so he goes, I'm going to, I'm going to put you on antibiotics, uh, just, just in  case it's, everything is related here.  That's going on with you.  Uh, come back in, you know, two weeks.  I'm like, all right.  And, uh, my PSA was normal high.  There's a new thing in the medical community called normal high. 
[01:48:30]  You're in the normal range, but it's on the high side.  So that scares you.  Cause I go, well, it's normal, uh, normal high.  So that's something to worry about.  It's a new thing in the medical field.  I'm sure doctors will call hate that.  So I'm like, what?  So I'm on antibiotics for a couple of weeks.  He goes, come back.  I come back.  And, uh, he goes, all right, press, you know, let's do this again.  I'm going to bend over again.  And I'm assuming, all right, come on, you know?  And he goes, I'm still there.  I'm like, what?  Now I'm like fucking panicking. 
[01:49:00]  He goes, uh, let's schedule a biopsy.  He goes, I can see you a week from Thursday.  I'm like, it's Monday.  I got to wait another.  Now I got to wait another 10 days.  Of this just haunting you.  Right.  And the ball thing started probably, I don't know, a month earlier than that when I was  thinking it was testicular cancer.  Now we're moving on to prostate cancer.  So now I have to wait 10 days, right?  Yeah.  And, uh, finally the day comes and I, uh, how panic-stricken were you the night before? 
[01:49:30]  Dude, I've been out of my mind for a long time, for a couple months easy.  Oh, I thought you were going to say years.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, the mind is still fucked up.  I'm not stupid.  So, uh, I actually, uh, tweeted the picture.  I go into the examination room and they're all prepared for the, uh, the biopsy.  Ant's putting his coat on.  It's just, no, no.  You just want to feel comfort.  I need warmth.  I'm, I'm getting cold chills.  I get very queasy with medical talk.  I was telling Anthony this whole story and at one point he goes, I'm getting really dizzy. 
[01:50:00]  I go, I'm getting dizzy and I turn, I turn, uh, completely white and I feel faint.  I can't take like medical talk.  That's why I never watched ER or any of those things.  They'd start talking about stuff and I'd be like, ah, oh, uh, so I go in the, the examination  room and, uh, I snapped a picture cause I, I was thinking someday hopefully we'll, we'll  get a good laugh at this.  And that is what was waiting for me.  Opie radio on Twitter. 
[01:50:30]  If you want to check it out for yourself, it looks like my fucking, my electric toothbrush.  It's a, I was going to say when I was into model rocketry, there was one called big Bertha  that looks like big Bertha.  It's, it looks like the biggest dildo I've ever seen as far as length goes.  And with is a big fat dildo.  Well, someone on Twitter last night goes, could you give us some kind of perspective 
[01:51:00]  how fucking thick that is?  And I'm like, look, the condom is barely, it's pretty fucking tight on the thing.  Is that a condom?  Yes.  They put a condom over it, Jimmy.  Oh my God.  Do you know what his mouth, like the hooker?  So, so break the tension in the room.  There's a big, huge dollop of lube on the top of this.  There certainly is.  Of this thing.  Uh, my caption was, I had to do battle with this to find out I didn't have cancer. 
[01:51:30]  So then, um, so then I had to go on my side and then the doctor.  Now I heard now, now quickly here.  I heard when they do ask questions, ask questions when, when they give guys the pipe, when they  check out your colon, uh, I heard they give them Valium and they're just laying there on  the side, like blah, blah, and they don't give a shit at that point.  Uh, they just put a snake in a tube up their, uh, rectum.  Uh, maybe we could get a doctor on the phone. 
[01:52:00]  The only thing I did.  So I'm thinking when you get the pipe, it goes up a lot further, which means even more  discomfort.  That's the only thing I could think of.  Hey, look, the fucking, no shit.  That lubricant goes in and, and you need a Valium.  Well, the, the, the lubricant is more numbing gel.  So then I'm on my side and the doctor now puts some dollop on his finger.  Now he's back in my ass, numbing up the area, back in your ass, back in my ass.  And then he, and then he puts up, uh, puts another dollop of some shit on his finger 
[01:52:30]  and back in my ass two or three times with that.  Then he goes, excuse me, my tongue is numb.  And then he goes, uh, all right, well now we're going to, you know, now we're going to  do the biopsy, meaning, you know, he's picking up the apparatus.  I'm like, Oh fuck.  And like I wrote on Twitter last night, I'm now convinced that you, you, you, you, you  do not choose to be gay.  There's no way you would choose that for pleasure.  I'm sorry.  So it's not, there's no fucking way.  You're born gay.  You have to be chosen lifestyle. 
[01:53:00]  You fucking have to be.  Isn't it amazing when you have a finger in your ass, even how all you think of is, I'm  going to shit, I'm going to shit, I'm going to shit.  I'm going to shit.  Yeah.  I cannot take even a finger past the first knuckle.  I really can't take it.  Hey, I'm going to, here's the blowjob, finger, I'm going to shit, I'm going to shit, I'm  going to shit, I'm going to shit.  You hopeless romantic.  I really am.  I'm going to pretzel nugget your fingertip.  Move it.  I feel like an asshole. 
[01:53:30]  I didn't call you.  No, but not during the, not during the thing, because I understand how medical shit is.  I mean, radio's radio, but I wasn't even thinking.  I'm an idiot.  That's right, man.  Like, okay.  Yeah.  So, so he goes, okay, we're going to, we're going to do the biopsies, and he, he says,  you're going to feel something that, like, is like the snapping of a.  Like a big cock in your ass.  No shit.  You should have said that.  You're going to feel something like hands on your hips.  No shit.  And, oh, when I walked in, the technician, a really hot black woman was in there, I go, 
[01:54:00]  you got to be shitting me.  I go, how long will that fucking thing be in my, that's exactly what I said, too.  How long, five to seven minutes.  I'm like, what?  Oh.  So he goes, you're going to feel like something that feels like a rubber band snapping.  And that's, that's him getting like, you know, a little biopsy of the, of the area.  Oh shit.  And I, I, I've been doing radio a long time.  I don't even know how to explain the uncomfortableness.  The pain wasn't that bad, but this weird feeling of like the rubber band snapping as he's getting 
[01:54:30]  the biopsies.  And then he hit a nerve because then I had a shooting pain that went right through the  top of my pee hole and I screamed.  He did 12.  I screamed at this one and it hurt for the rest of the day.  My right through my pee hole, like energy just went pow, pow.  Oh my God.  And then, uh, snipping pieces of skin off.  Yeah.  Then he's done. 
[01:55:00]  And then he goes, uh, I'll have the results in two weeks.  Uh, I'm going on vacation.  Two fucking weeks.  And that's what pissed me off.  And that's why I want to talk.  Two weeks.  Cause I, I've been now dealing with, do I have, you know, the big C or not for a while.  Finally got the biopsies and he's going on vacation.  And I just picture him on a beach having like a bikini teeny or a pina colada.  Doing the conga one.  Right.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Da da da.  And there's Opie.  Working on his tan as I'm in my, biting your nails.  Yeah.  New York city apartment, pulling my, my eyelashes out and pacing around my dark apartment. 
[01:55:30]  Olé, olé.  And then back to you, Anthony, make final expense payments.  Oh shit.  Right.  Fucking.  Are you kidding me?  There's gotta be a better way to do this.  Yeah.  Like to him, it's a day at the office.  To me, it's everything.  Why can't they email you the results?  Something.  There's gotta be a system.  Because I, I found out it, it takes a mere two days to get the results back. 
[01:56:00]  So why two weeks of wondering?  It's terrible.  So finally yesterday, after the show, I'm, uh, wandering around my apartment and I got,  I got, uh, the results that I'm completely fine.  Completely fine.  And I have just some inflammation, which was, uh, was the lump.  But I went through.  It was AIDS.  Yeah.  Yeah, great.  Dude, if there's any place you don't want trouble, it's, it's balls and asshole.  Right.  You don't have to deal with both of them at the same time.  It's fucking horrific.  And it all came back fine.  But I had a, I, I, I went through this.  And, uh, as I'm leaving the doctor's office after the biopsy, um, he said, well, there's 
[01:56:30]  one other thing.  You're, you're going to find, uh, blood.  Oh, here it goes.  Hold on.  In your urine, your stool, uh, and your ejaculate.  Oh, no.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, um, um, so I got my head down.  Blood in your ejaculate.  So, after the biopsy, my first shit, this is going to make yesterday's, uh, conversation 
[01:57:00]  sound like we're in kindergarten class.  Trust me.  But it looked like a big jelly roll.  My first shit was, uh, some nice blood.  Nice blood.  Urine.  A little red.  Oh, God.  It freaks me out.  I only had one more thing to worry about.  The ejaculate.  He said this would happen for about a week.  Like, so, I'm, uh, it's not something you want to experiment with, uh, with your girl. 
[01:57:30]  No.  I'm like, oh, my God.  So, I go, all right.  You know what?  Let's see if I got blood in my ejaculate.  So.  You have to go on the floor at the booth and look.  You all right, Ant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I'll be okay.  So, I, uh, decided I need to find out if there's going to be blood in my ejaculate.  So, I go to bed a little early.  You know.  Invite Dracula in.  Suck your dick. 
[01:58:00]  How long does it take you to crank one out?  I go to bed a little early.  With that on your mind, really?  Actually, I, it was, actually, it was a rough one, to be honest, because, you know, I was  doing it for an experiment, mostly.  So, I go to, science.  I go to bed a little early.  I get a, I get a few tissues.  And I say, all right, let's see what's, what this is all about.  I think my, my girl was at school, actually.  And, uh, I, uh, I, uh, completed.  And I swear to you, not going to pump this up. 
[01:58:30]  Sometimes radio guys like to pump up some things a little bit, a little bit.  We'll openly admit that.  I shot dark, red blood all over my stomach.  Oh, my God.  Dark.  It's a nightmare.  Red blood.  It was the most horrific thing I've ever seen in my entire life.  Not a mixture.  It was like you were shooting ketchup.  Did it hurt? 
[01:59:00]  Nope.  He said it wouldn't hurt.  Did it feel the same?  Yeah.  Oh, that rules.  Rules.  Why does it rule?  That just rules.  Why does that rule?  I don't know.  It's all I would do is fucking pick up chicks and fucking cum blood on them.  Now look at you.  You're infected.  Dude, it was.  Taste the blood of Satan.  I was shooting blood.  Oh.  Shooting it.  Did you get a picture of that?  You should, you did.  What the fuck, dude?  That's one you should get a photo of.  And tweet it?  No, just for yourself. 
[01:59:30]  I don't feel good.  Maybe I did get a picture.  Make me woozy.  You might have to start following me.  Did I get a picture?  No.  Twitter some blood ejaculate.  Yeah.  Most unbelievable thing ever.  That's disgusting.  But this, this is why, this is why guys, especially our age, just don't go to the doctor.  We just don't go.  Because the wondering, the amount of time it takes for them to figure shit out, test results. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, we could, we could squeeze you in in two weeks.  Two weeks.  I need to know tomorrow.  I don't care you got, you know, you're, you're a successful practice.  Squeeze me in.  Immediately.  This is something I don't want to wait on.  You squeezed it in, all right.  Let me say hi to Ken in Louisiana.  Ken.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Hey, Ken.  Did they, did they show you the needle that they actually, that was making the rubber band noise? 
[02:00:30]  I just saw the apparatus.  I didn't want to know any more, man.  So what?  I'm assuming that it's some kind of needle that pops out like a sewing needle.  It's got to go through the intestine and hit the prostate.  Get the fuck out of here.  No.  Actually, the prostate where it sits, where the ultrasound probe, which is the big bilbo that you saw, the needle, that's a guide.  That shows you the prostate.  They look, they isolate the nodule.  The needle actually slides along the probe with a little case. 
[02:01:00]  And it's about 12 inches long.  And when that thing goes in, it snaps.  And it's like a, almost like a, like you said, a sewing thing.  And that's what pushes, that's what snaps the tissue in.  And they do that about, probably about 15 to 20 times.  And when you start bleeding, it's because I've assisted in an ultrasound tech.  And you bleed all over the place.  And it's, it's pretty disgusting.  But I don't understand.  How does it get to the prostate if it's up your ass? 
[02:01:30]  Well, because of where it, the prostate sits actually right below the bladder.  And that's how they visualize it.  But it's just a, it's not like.  If, if the, the thing is your intestinal wall is between the apparatus and your prostate.  Your prostate isn't in your intestines.  So how does it, it's got to, does it actually go through the intestinal wall and into the prostate?  Yes.  It's just, it's just that, it's like a visceral, like, film. 
[02:02:00]  And you just, it's right where it's at.  It's not like, the probe actually doesn't go in all the way.  I mean, it might go in, it might go in probably about, which is far enough, but three or four or five inches maybe, just depending on how big your prostate is.  If it's inflamed, because they measure the size of it, they take a prostate volume as well.  And that all has to do with, you know, if he's on the high side of his PSA, that's what initially, that's the test that initially shoots him off to say, okay, if he's on the normal high or the high side, let's just check it. 
[02:02:30]  Especially when you get around 40 or 45 and depending on your family history as well.  Yeah, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was fairly normal high.  It was normal.  And it was like a rubber band snap.  Right.  And it's, it's a pretty, it's a pretty wicked looking neo gun there.  They, it's, it's pretty, it was, I've seen several of them done and I don't want it done.  But when we get that age, we all eventually probably will have to have it done.  It was extremely uncomfortable, but one of them, did he hit a nerve? 
[02:03:00]  Because one, I can't even, the shooting pain right through, right through my pee hole, man.  Just hit a nerve.  Huh?  I'm sure you, I'm sure you, I'm sure you were, I'm sure that they tried to make you comfortable, but you can never be too comfortable for something like that.  No, not at all.  Yeah, thank you, Ken.  You're the only guy on the bus lying on your stomach.  What's the matter with you? 
[02:03:30]  Hold on a minute.  Cindy, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Matt and Rouge.  Hi.  I just want to say that I used to work in a same day surgery center where we used to do those procedures every single day.  I didn't work in the actual room because I was a pre-op nurse who would help you get ready and then recover.  And I would wait probably at least two weeks before you even attempt to have sex.  That was always the first question was, guys, how long do I have to wait?  But you are the fucking man for doing that without sedation. 
[02:04:00]  Did they do?  We hated every patient we had.  Nobody, one guy tried it without and he jumped off the table.  I can't even take it.  Yes.  Could you move it in and out quickly and angrily?  The guys used to try to make jokes, you know, like, hey, if I feel your hands on my hips, I'm going to get a little more.  Oh, I tried some of that stuff.  I pretty much bit my hand off and they didn't offer me any meds.  It was like more of a like a gel to try to numb the area. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Fuck that.  No, we did IV sedation for everybody.  Fuck no.  I wasn't even offered that.  Yeah.  You went to the wrong place then because that's that's absurd.  That's horrific and mean.  Any guy going for that, you need to get IV sedation.  Knock the fuck out.  And yes, wake me up when you're done.  Tell me I'm all right.  I don't know if girls can relate to this, but I'm pretty much every guy listening can.  You ever get that feeling that you have to urinate, but you can't can't urinate.  I live with this.  I had that feeling for about a day and the same with having to do a number two. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  But nothing.  The muscles are all spasmed and all irritated.  It was so uncomfortable.  Yes.  For at least a day.  I definitely would have waited at least two weeks before sex because, but yeah.  It was, well, I had to know and boy, did I get the answer.  God fucking unbelievable.  I just need to say that you are definitely the only man I've ever heard going through  that without sedation, so. 
[02:05:30]  Well, I don't feel like I'm.  Catch yourself on the back for that one.  Well, I don't feel like I'm a brave guy.  I was not offered any other choices, so.  Well, then your doctor sucked.  All right, Cindy.  Thank you.  Where's, um, where's, uh, Kensington?  Where is Kenny?  Joseph T. Curry.  Is here?  Who I cordially invited to come up.  All right.  Is, uh, yeah, he's here.  So.  Let's get him in here.  Yeah, I told him to come by about nine o'clock.  Let's say hi to Trucker John.  Where is that queer?  He's down in the lobby.  Someone's got to get him.  Go get him.  Because this building's highly secure. 
[02:06:00]  Trucker John.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, I gotta say, you're a better man than me.  I'm going to have it done Monday.  But I'm getting knocked out.  Yeah.  Um.  And, and I had it done two years ago.  Yep.  And the numbers are still up there, so it's another repeat.  And go back to what you were saying.  He says, no sex for two weeks.  But you gotta take care of yourself to get the bad shit out and the good stuff replenished. 
[02:06:30]  It starts out like a blackish color.  Oh, my God.  It gets brown.  Sorry.  It goes back to the normal color.  Oh, my God.  We're losing it.  I'm getting so faint.  For real, we're losing it.  I'm getting faint.  Trucker John, I hope it works out for you.  I, I, I don't know, man.  So, I mean, people get the bad news.  I, I, I don't, I don't know.  I don't know what I'm supposed to say today.  It was, I guess I'm talking to the people that have to go through all this and to find  out, man, that, you know, you had nothing to worry about again.  I don't know.  Now, wait, they have to go through the other one where they go up through the penis, the 
[02:07:00]  system scope.  Oh, you lost, Dan.  What's that for?  What's that for?  I'm not doing that.  That's if you have a little trace of blood in your urine, they want to do that test on  you.  That's tapping hard.  Same thing, get knocked out because you don't want to know shit because when you wake up,  they ask you if you can take a piss and you piss pure blood.  Oh, God.  What kind of?  At least the 10, 10 times.  Oh, my God.  It's, I'm telling you, we're going to do some nasty things, but men have their own problems 
[02:07:30]  they got to deal with.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  You guys have a good day.  What kind of cancer?  Pancreatic.  Is it right?  That's for bladder cancer.  They, when they go up through that way, the front end is for bladder cancer.  It sounds like one of these fucking diner commercials, one of these diner conversations  the old people have at the table next to you, you know, I'm trying to eat all the time.  And what they did was they opened him up and they found the cancer. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  They just had to sew him up and send him back home.  Let's go.  I'm eating.  Let's go, footer.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know, I'm having a little problem.  I think I may have Lou Gehrig's disease, but don't worry about it.  I'm going to keep you guys all posted on MySpace and I'll keep my family posted on MySpace.  And, uh, uh, yeah, that's it.  I'm feeling a little uncomfortable right now.  So, uh.  Why?  Because it's bombed?  You got it, buddy. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, uh.  Let me say hi.  We'll just take a few more and we'll get back to the funny.  Mitch, Long Island, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Uh, well, I'm like, oh, but I had a cancer scare.  They thought I had a lymphoma at the tail end of last year.  Oh, my God.  But, uh, you know, after some tests, they did a bone marrow biopsy.  They did a biopsy on one of my lymph nodes.  They were dilated. 
[02:09:00]  But, um, everything turned out right.  It turned out it was, uh, just HIV.  Hello?  Hello?  Bill the trucker.  Bill.  Hey, what's going on, man?  One more bomb and we're out, and we'll go back to the normal show.  Yes, Bill.  Hey, uh, I had prostate cancer last year.  I was 41 years old.  I went through the same thing as you, Ope.  No, uh, sedative or nothing.  No.  My head doesn't allow it. 
[02:09:30]  Hey, Ope, I had my prostate removed.  And the great thing now is when I jack off, there's no cleanup.  Well, if your prostate's gone, is it, uh, wait, this will come, right?  Oh, no, nothing comes out.  Just sperm cells are being made.  What's that?  You feel like you're coming, but, uh, nothing comes out.  So you have orgasms, but you can still get a heart on?  Uh, well, I can't right now. 
[02:10:00]  It's getting better, but it's taken a while to get back to normal.  But, yeah, you can still feel the orgasm.  Are you cancer-free now?  Uh, yeah.  I have been now for a little over six months.  Yeah, that prostate cancer is, like, treatable, but you've got to get, you know, I don't want to give a speech, but you've got to get the finger up the ass because it's so treatable.  Yeah, I got a good one for Anthony.  When they did my surgery, they went through my taint.  Oh, Jesus.  It just took his head off. 
[02:10:30]  You want to go to the bathroom?  It's woozy.  I want to knock him out with this talk.  We're almost there.  We're almost there.  He's sweating.  He's stretching.  He's looking at the floor.  His headphones are off.  I got to get some hands to my head.  They had to give me stool softeners so I could shit because, you know, you don't want to be screaming.  But, anyway, my dear, everything's okay, yo. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  And then you start looking on WebMD.  That's the dumbest thing anyone can do.  It's so stupid.  Because it's always the worst case scenario.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I got an earache.  I wonder what, let me, let's see what an earache could possibly be.  Well, it's a little bit of everything, isn't it?  It's a flow chart that leads to cancer.  Every single fucking thing.  Inoperable brain tumor.  Right.  You've just been diagnosed.  Thank you.  And then an ad pops up for fucking, you know, car insurance. 
[02:11:30]  I got to block WebMD from my computer.  Yes.  I learned that.  Yay.  Let me go to Owen.  A couple more or should we move on?  The phone's left, though.  Talk to him.  Owen.  Oh.  Owen.  Owen.  O.B., you're an admirable man.  I actually just performed for a prostate biopsy yesterday.  Oh, really?  Had I known you were receiving one, I would have thought of you and maybe done a few extra  cores for my patient. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, wonderful.  So what, so you stick fingers up guys' asses for a living?  I do, you know, I'm actually just driving to the office now, but I just left the hospital  where I was seeing a patient for some grossly-spied urine.  Very exciting stuff.  Uh-huh.  It was doing okay, but he's back.  Yeah.  He's wobbling.  What was in the guy's urine?  But actually, it was interesting, you know, obviously blood clots, and so when you have  a lot of blood in your urine, you have to take a syringe and irrigate all the blood 
[02:12:30]  of their bladder.  I am so woozy right now.  I have to splash water on my face.  Good stuff.  Good stuff, good stuff.  Owen, can't we get a better system?  Because, you know, there's people out there really worried about test results, and then  you've got to wait for the doctor's schedule to free up and wait for him to get back  on vacation.  Well, yeah, I know.  I mean, you can probably get results within two days. 
[02:13:00]  The problem is that your doctor usually wants to see you to give your results face to face,  whether they're bad or good.  Right.  There is an x-ray called a processing scan, but you really need tissue diagnosis to find  out what's going on.  Right.  You know.  So then we have to sit and wait.  Yeah, unfortunately.  But I'll be thinking of you, hoping you get good results.  No, I'm good.  Oh, you're good?  Yeah.  He did get good results. 
[02:13:30]  Yesterday.  Clean bill of health, completely.  I've been sitting on the phone trying to get through.  I've only been intermittently listening to you.  Oh, okay.  No, that's why I'm bringing it to the show.  Oh, well, wonderful.  Scare over.  Until the next time, because that's what we get for living.  We get some free time in between scares.  Great.  Yeah, that's pretty much what it is.  Thank you, God.  Thank you.  Horrific health scares.  Yeah, thank you.  Crotch Critter, what's going on?  As you rot away with every year that goes by, your body rots. 
[02:14:00]  You hope to get a few good years of no worry, and then the next scare comes along.  Yeah, all your bestias are behind you.  Isn't that wonderful?  Crotch Critter, what do you got?  I was about 12 years old, and what happened was, playing baseball and everything, I never  figured out really what happened, but all of a sudden I had a twisted testicle.  So, my nuts swelled up about the size of a softball.  Then, I go in, what they ended up doing was cutting the sack open, and physically manipulating 
[02:14:30]  it so that it was back normal.  Wait, you should be proud of yourself, because you're the one that got Anthony to officially  tap out.  This ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This ain't happening.  Look over there, Ant.  Well, that's not even a half of it, because I have to go back in to have a catheter. 
[02:15:00]  Get that off, please.  Wait a minute, Danny.  Hey, Crotch Critter's trying to tell a story, Ant.  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong?  I don't want to hear it.  I'm faint.  I can't take this blood and guts.  What?  Danny, just put a picture up so you have a visual of what Crotch Critter's talking about.  Sensitive area stuff I can't do.  I, I...  So, they end up, they shoved the catheter up my pee hole.  Oh, God.  I can still hear it.  All the nurses are females. 
[02:15:30]  Nothing like being 12 years old and having a room full of nurses shoving a six-foot  hose up your dick.  I don't know.  Here's the thing.  I don't know.  The whole, the good thing about this is that now I've got about a three-inch scar on my neck.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I don't have to wear condoms.  I just tell them that I got, I got a vasectomy years ago.  With what, a chainsaw?  That's it, boys.  All right.  Let me, uh, say, we're almost done. 
[02:16:00]  Uh, Jeff in, uh, Kentucky.  Jeff?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, uh, a few years ago I had a vasectomy and my doctor did not tell me about the, uh,  the bloody load that would follow.  Oh, bloody loads.  So we had no idea.  Wait, wait, Jeff.  Yeah.  You take yourself out of it.  Was it the most amazing thing you've ever seen in your life?  Well, it was, uh, what was more amazing about it was the first time was, uh, my wife was  giving me a blowjob and I shot it in her mouth. 
[02:16:30]  Good for you.  Oh, my God.  I'm woozy now.  Yeah.  Uh, it was, uh, it was quite an ordeal in the bedroom that night.  People want to know how close Anthony is to passing out for real?  He's not doing well.  Oh, God.  This is, this.  I looked again.  Anthony does not like this squeamish shit.  That's a testicle outside of the sack.  Oh, that's cool.  I, I, I will, when we take the next break, I will go in the bathroom and splash cold.  It looks like a small fucking, what are those small onions?  It just looks like.  The, what are those small little clear onions? 
[02:17:00]  A scallion?  Yeah.  Hey, it's old scallion nuts.  Can you imagine biting into that?  It just looks like a, like a, a little hamster being born.  It's cute, actually.  Uh, so what else, Jeff?  Uh, that's it, boys.  Punching out.  Very good.  All right.  Oh, this is good.  This is fun.  Bill in Queens.  Bill?  Hello, Bill.  Hello, guys.  My, my, my dad just had an operation where they took out the, like the last 18 inches of  his, uh, large intestines. 
[02:17:30]  And after the operation, he was peeing.  At the end of his piss, his dick farted a little bit.  Come on in.  That's just funny.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  It's funny, but he was like blinking.  Did that really just happen?  He said he felt it.  He heard it.  And then, uh, I guess the doctor said he must have gotten some air in his bladder or something  like that.  It smell like mom's breath.  As long as he didn't shart.  Shart. 
[02:18:00]  Uh, let's say, uh, to David in Baton Rouge.  David.  Yeah, what's going on?  Uh, I want to know if you're going to change your name to, uh, Jackula.  All right, see?  That's funny.  And is, uh, is Steve going to numb the area next time?  Num, num, num, num, num?  A num, num.  Watch out.  No, that was good.  Oh, this is a good one, Ant.  Jim in Virginia.  We're almost, how about we, we'll make it to nine o'clock, Ant.  Can you make it to nine?  Five minutes.  I can't do five more minutes.  This is killing me. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, Jim had a great call, too.  Where'd he go?  Oh, thank you, Jim, for hanging out.  Oh, boo.  Let's go to Brian in Kentucky.  Brian.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I had kidney stone surgery, and I, uh, put a stint in.  It goes from the tip of your dick all the way to your kidney.  It's a long tube.  And I had to pull it out myself.  And it's...  Was that bad insurance?  Yeah.  You had to pull it out yourself.  We'll start the surgery, but you got to take the stitches out.  Yeah, but I didn't know it was looped. 
[02:19:00]  So when I was pulling it, I could feel it unloop inside of me twice, pulling it out.  And it was about as long as my leg by the time I got it out.  Wowee.  Look how painful.  Yeah.  Look how painful I am.  I see.  I feel like I know I'm pale.  I know you hate this talk.  And I can't...  I know you hate this talk.  I get the heebie-jeebies.  Let me go to, uh, Stoney in Connecticut.  All right.  Four minutes to go in.  You can do it.  Go ahead, Stoney.  Hey, guys.  Well, the problem that I got right now is I have a fungal growth inside my urethra. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, no.  A what?  Yeah.  A fungal growth.  A fungal growth inside my urethra.  He's growing mushrooms in his dick.  I'm going tomorrow to get it scraped.  They have to squint your dick and scrape it?  They're going to scrape it.  They're going to put an instrument inside my penis and scrape it out.  Come on, Ed.  You can do it.  Are they, um...  Oh, now it's four minutes.  A fucking barnacle remover.  I can't make a fist.  Really?  Like, my...  Really?  My muscle is weak.  I feel so fucking woozy. 
[02:20:00]  I wanted to ask old barnacle dick a question.  He hung up.  Barnacle dick.  This is a fun one.  Rich the Trucker.  Rich?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Got one for Ant.  Hey, I had a hydrosale.  And they kind of scar tissue around your nuts.  And one of them was like about four times the size of the other one.  They had to pull it out.  Cut the sack open.  Pull it out.  And they said they had to peel it like an orange. 
[02:20:30]  And then they stuck a tube in there and let it drain for a couple of days.  Yeah.  You're all right now, right?  No.  Oh, everything's fine now.  It's a little bigger than the other one.  But everything's fine now.  Yeah.  Ant, you're all right?  So enjoy, Ant.  Bye.  Ant's not talking anymore.  That sucks.  Let me say hi to Danny in California.  Danny.  Come on, Ant.  We got to bring this to the show.  People are dealing with real shit out there.  Yes, they are.  Real shit.  Go ahead, Danny. 
[02:21:00]  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Danny.  Hey.  My two-month-old daughter had MRSA on her labia when she was just a brand-new baby.  We had to fly her down to the hospital down in Fresno.  The thing swelled up the size of an Idaho russet potato.  Sure.  Ew.  And, yeah, they had a two-inch incision, cut it out.  That wasn't even the worst part.  So they cut the thing out. 
[02:21:30]  They said that there was more pus, four ounces of pus, green and yellow pus.  No.  Now I'm done.  Now I'm done.  Why?  The way pus got you?  Now four ounces of pus.  You got two more minutes here.  We made a deal.  Two more minutes.  Two more minutes.  Two more fucking labial lip.  Now this is from...  Now keep in mind.  This is from my baby.  Talk all you want.  No, put your headphones on.  This is where he makes a joke.  No, this is not a joke.  Not a joke.  Then what they do, because it's MRSA, they have to shove a... 
[02:22:00]  They can't close the incision.  So they have to shove a cotton swab into the incision for four days afterwards and pull it centimeter by centimeter out every day with more pus coming out of the incision every day.  For the people on hold, the word is pus.  That really gets Anthony.  I just learned.  Yeah.  So keep in mind now, this is my baby girl. 
[02:22:30]  All I'm thinking about is what is her husband going to think when she's got a second incision right next to her little...  How do I say this?  It's like the Daphne on Jaws when they found Chrissy.  You know, so now we got it.  You know, I'm praying to God that that thing heals up sometimes.  Right.  You know, before she gets married or whatever.  Well, at least before her, you know, 15th birthday these days.  Right. 
[02:23:00]  So how is Frank and Cunt?  His daughter.  Well, I think she needs her two holes down there, you know, or three holes down there, you know.  Not good.  Not good.  Let me...  Thank you, sir.  Chris in Columbus.  Hey, guys.  My brother had his bowel rupture and he ended up having to have a colostomy.  He had to wear a bag for about three months and literally a week after he had his plumbing reattached, there was another rupture and then another colostomy again. 
[02:23:30]  I will tell you something.  After he would eat, that colostomy bag would swell up like a balloon from the gas.  And if he wanted to be a spartass, he would slowly unclip the end and squeeze some of that gas out.  Let me tell you, you've never smelled anything worse in your entire life than raw, nice and juicy colostomy gas.  I mean, I would rather sleep inside a deer carcass along the side of the road than to have to smell that again. 
[02:24:00]  Un-fucking-believable.  It's so bad.  You know what I love about this segment?  People can't wait to call to share today.  They just can't wait.  They've been waiting for this day for years.  You all right?  I'm getting no blood to my head.  All right, let me get an easy one for you, Ed.  I'm going to get you an easy one.  Don't worry.  Let me go with Biscuits in North Carolina.  Biscuits?  Yeah, buh-buh-boy. 
[02:24:30]  Hey.  You and me?  Hello, Biscuits.  How are you doing?  Better now.  When we were about eight, eight or nine, we were playing on a boat trailer, empty boat trailer,  and my cousin had seemed to be a little bit more portly than the rest of us.  Well, he was on the front of it, and when he got up, the back of it, lifted up, ripped his sack from asshole to scrotal.  They dropped out on the floor.  No fucking way. 
[02:25:00]  He castrated himself?  No, no.  He just ripped the sack open.  He just ripped the sack open, and his nads fell out and just hung there.  And he picked him up and went in to our grandmother and passed out on the floor.  It was nice.  That's all I got, boys.  I don't feel good.  I hate this.  All right.  An easy one, Ed.  For real.  Hey, it's two minutes after nine.  No.  Hey.  It's not nine o'clock in California yet. 
[02:25:30]  Let's say hi to Troy in Tampa.  Troy.  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I had the pleasure of getting a circumcision at the ripe old age of 16.  Why?  You know what?  It was like an aesthetic thing.  I was just sick of looking at my dick like that, and I was like, I don't want this.  I don't want that.  Snuffle off.  All right.  So you were sick of looking at your penis, so you figured, I'll hack some of that off.  Yeah.  How about you just look away?  It was probably the worst decision for the first two weeks, because, you know, it just randomly bleeds on you, and it was just brutal. 
[02:26:00]  You had to have gauze around it at all times.  You all right, Ann?  How does it look now?  Oh, no.  Now it looks fine.  Now it looks, you know, completely normal, to be honest.  There you go.  Let's go to John.  John?  My mouth's all dry, and I'm drinking water, and I'm getting caught.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  We're just waiting for the knockout punch.  It could happen at any time.  I tapped out.  John?  Yeah.  When I was in high school, my testicle got pulled up into my body. 
[02:26:30]  They had to cut open my sack and pull the testicle down, and then they sutured it to the sack.  I can't.  But then it got infected, and my whole sack filled up with puffs.  You know what the amazing thing really is?  How different Aunt and I really are.  She's got a boner.  She's got a boner again.  Why do you have a boner?  Can you explain why you have a boner? 
[02:27:00]  Hey, you know, Cialis.  Cialis.  I just love the excitement in the caller's voices.  The excitement.  They can't wait to tell the world.  Steve.  Hey, boys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thank you.  My dad has prostate with growing, like, roots into his urethra.  He had to get an operation known as, like, a terp where they take, like, an auger, like  a little roto-rooter, and shoot it down your urethra to clear it all out.  I'm out. 
[02:27:30]  I'm out.  And here's the best part.  Came back cancer.  He was in a box 11 months later.  Oh, sorry to hear that.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm bringing back the money.  With all that pain for what?  Punch it out.  All right.  Sorry about that.  That sucks.  A hip replacement patient?  You want to hear?  Hip replacement.  That's easy.  Sure.  Paul Stanley, you're on the line.  Let's go to Derek in Tennessee.  You can handle a hip replacement story.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Derek.  I'm actually not the guy that got a hip replacement, but I am the rep, the sales rep 
[02:28:00]  that was in the room.  So they start the whole deal.  They start to screw to, it's actually, he had an infection, and they take a bone screw  and they screw it in there.  Well, there was so much pus under pressure that it literally sprayed out, like, almost hit  the ceiling, hit people around him in the door.  Oh, stop.  It smelled awful.  I've never smelled anything like it in my life.  How's Ant doing?  He's not, I've decided, I see a phone call that will knock him out. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  I will guarantee.  Wish it could have been me.  Sorry, guys.  That was pretty good.  I got a phone call.  If this is true, I guarantee the fine people listening to this show, this will knock Anthony  out.  Now, Anthony, keep your headphones on.  Okay, I'll turn it.  I want to see if this is the knockout phone call.  Oh, God.  John in Jersey.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Love you, love the show.  Wait, wait.  I used to work at a hospital, Hackensack Hospital in Jersey, and there was an entire floor full 
[02:29:00]  of people that had a bowel disorder that literally made them shit from their mouths.  Wow.  It was pretty fucking horrific.  Dude, what was it called?  Bubba the Love Spongitis?  I have no idea what the disorder was.  I was on security at the hospital, and the floor smelled like pukey shit.  It was disgusting.  Isn't that a real thing that could happen to you?  It was a real fucking disorder where their bowels backed up, and they could not process 
[02:29:30]  it through the normal area, and it would actually come out of their mouths.  So what do they do besides chew a lot of gum and whisper?  Whisper sweet nothings in your ear, Jimmy.  There you go.  All right.  Urethral dilation.  You want one of those, Ant?  No.  No.  No.  Vasectomy that went bad.  No.  This guy has testy cancer and wants you to see his one ball. 
[02:30:00]  No.  No?  Any of these?  I'm done.  All right.  We should go to break.  One more.  John in Florida.  John.  I'm done.  Hey, Ope.  Yep.  You got me?  Hey.  Hi, Ant.  Hi, Jimmy's Boner.  Hi.  I had a prostate biopsy last Friday, and I was out, fortunately, so I didn't suffer the  way you did, but my boss who had had one last year said, yeah, it's basically like sticking  a nail gun up your ass and then using it, but the bad part, and what really annoys the 
[02:30:30]  crap out of me is I had the test last Friday, my follow-up appointment with my doctors, and  that's scheduled until the 23rd of June because he's going on vacation for two weeks and couldn't  get me in.  What the fuck is that about?  That's the point I want to make today.  What the fuck?  Yeah, so I'm sitting, waiting, keeping my fingers crossed, hoping.  Shouldn't there be a stand-in doctor or someone that could call you and tell you?  Well, I don't know.  I call them every day and try to aggravate the shit out of them. 
[02:31:00]  Hopefully, they'll get tired of me and just tell me what I need to hear.  Get another doctor to call that doctor.  Right.  It's just driving me crazy.  Right.  But the bloody load thing, though, is pretty cool.  I don't know how many you've shot, but I'm up to four now.  Ant's getting up.  I'm going to get up, Ant.  And it's still not clear.  I can now eat this puss.  Ant's up.  Danny's showing you two puss videos.  You're talking about the fact that you're up to your fourth blood cum load. 
[02:31:30]  Yep.  Ant is doubled over.  He's standing.  I'm splashing water on my face.  All right.  Yeah, we should take a break.  I'll be right back.  John, I hope everything works out for you.  Thanks.  All right, man.  Bye.  There you go.  Figured I'd share a little bit today.  You all right, Ant?  We'll break and...  Wait, this guy had an anal sphincterotomy, Ant.  Ant! 
[02:32:00]  Jimmy!  I'm going to go, babe.  You're out, too?  Yeah.  But look at this guy.  He's got...  Hey...  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  I thought we were all just having fun.  Danny?  Me and you?  You'd like these stories, right?  Not especially.  Really?  Well, because I know it's going to...  I'll have to go through some of these one day. 
[02:32:30]  So it's kind of...  It's not like...  Getting old.  It's not very nice to look forward to.  Dude, getting older.  What the fuck?  They should...  They should tell you this thing when you're young.  Plus, my family is just riddled with health conditions, so I know one of these things  will happen.  Well, unfortunately, one of these things happens to every single person.  I've never even been to the hospital.  Last time I was at the hospital for my own situation was when I was born.  That's it.  Never broke a bone.  Never had a bad...  You know what?  Infection.  Except for a massive allergy attack that almost took me out. 
[02:33:00]  That's the only time I was at a hospital.  Never.  I've visited plenty of people in hospitals my age.  As you know, people do stuff, get fucked up, never been to the hospital for anything.  Knock on wood, my friend.  So I'm sure something just completely terrible will happen to me over the weekend.  Well, the phones are lit, though.  People love sharing.  See, they go through this stuff.  All right, we'll break.  Had to change a tampon-like device for my dad's taint.  Ooh, I should save that one for Anthony. 
[02:33:30]  Friend got blood clot in his pee hole.  Oh.  All right, we'll save a few of these for Anthony.  Anal sphincterotomy.  What is that about, you think?  This is like fight club stuff.  Isn't it?  Chuck Palahniuk could write a whole book on this.  I've never heard of an anal sphincterotomy.  I can barely say the word.  All right.  The word of the day is pus.  We'll continue.  We'll continue.  We'll continue.  Oh, I need it back. 
[02:34:00]  You all right, Ed?  Well, I visited the men's room.  The bedroom?  Yeah.  Took a leak since I was there.  You know, you're there anyway.  It's like topping off the tank if you go to a rest stop and get a blowjob. 
[02:34:30]  Why not?  And then a little cold water on the face.  Some deep breaths.  Well.  Thinking happy thoughts.  I think you've suffered enough.  We should move on, right?  Thank you.  The phones are still lit, though.  I'll make you suffer.  Anal sphincterotomy.  I mean, come on.  We're going to pass on that phone call, unfortunately.  Yes.  How about we do a little more of this next week?  This show got pretty gross this week. 
[02:35:00]  Yes, this was gross week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we won't do this all the time.  We have a theme like Regis.  Right.  We're doing gross week.  Talk about your periods.  Hmm.  That's funny.  I think Regis would ask his famous female guests about their periods.  Yeah.  What is it like?  Do you have a heavy flow?  Something lighter?  What is it?  Heavy?  Is it thin and runny?  Or thick and clotty?  Like Kathy Bates?  Spotting. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  What about spotting?  We're here with Dakota Fanning.  What do you think yours will be like?  His famous asking gay people, blatantly gay people, if they're getting married or found the right girl.  He really is an unaware idiot, isn't he?  Elton John, your music's wonderful, Elton. 
[02:36:00]  You're a fantastic entertainer.  Why are you single?  The girl's probably throwing themselves at you.  You suck what?  Gelman's drooling in the corner.  Is Gelman gay?  I wouldn't say he is, but what I would say is, based on watching him over the years, he does come off, personally to me, he looks like he could be gay.  Does he remind you of homosexuality?  Yes! 
[02:36:30]  Why am I yelling at you?  I don't know.  We don't know.  We have no clue.  No idea.  I don't even know who Gelman is.  Gelman is?  My executive producer.  I know his name.  I don't know what he looks like.  He's surrounded with a notebook with pens in it, and he's always scrolling.  Then he repeats things other people say all the time.  They did a bit that lasted three months.  How do I do this one?  There's another guy in the show.  I'll keep it vague.  That if you think Gelman is, this guy is like the reincarnation of Liberace. 
[02:37:00]  And they had a whole contest to try to find him a woman, and it was Regis' idea.  They flew abroad in, and they actually went out, and then it was the uncomfortable conversation.  He says, ew.  He's wearing a salmon-colored shirt as they're doing the post-date interview.  And I think we'll just be, you know, be lifetime friends.  So how did it go?  Was there any, uh, was there a chance at any romance? 
[02:37:30]  Romance between the two of you.  And I'll make it perfectly clear.  I have no idea.  Well, Regis, he licked my pussy and then threw up into a bucket for four hours.  Fantastic.  That happened with me a joy the first time.  Regis came up with this great idea that let's find him a woman.  And it was like, I remember watching going, you're fucking kidding, right?  You've got to be kidding.  They found some housewife from Middle America to fly into New York and go on a date.  This goes back many years. 
[02:38:00]  I don't even know if the guy still works on the show.  You're assuming he's blatantly gay.  Dude.  I have no idea.  I want to make that perfectly clear, but.  Perfectly clear.  Foot in the corner with that awesome laugh of yours.  Hey, man.  Footy.  Hello.  How are you, Footy?  He was doing nothing today, so I figured he'd drop by.  I'm going to stop and I want to see the new place.  Yeah, see the new digs.  So, what do you think?  Well, it looks, you know, we come through the back door, running down.  It's like a white trash family moving into a nice neighborhood.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:38:30]  We're at the crossroads of Black Station, Gay Station, and Martha Stewart.  Perfect fit, huh?  I think they put us here so people could kind of get around us if they need to.  We're not bringing people in front of the window.  But this is like when you're a happy family, you're living in the nice big house, and then  your parents get divorced, and you go over to Daddy's apartment now, and you just look  around and go, you live in fucking squalor. 
[02:39:00]  Nothing but cold food and beer bottles.  Yeah.  The place is smaller.  No, it's more like.  Smells like his whores.  All the stuff you made him in art class is broken.  Thanks, Dad.  In the corner.  Get on top of it.  This is more like.  Pizza box.  You were home, and a gang broke in, and ruined everything you have, and raped your family,  and now you're going to see them.  Yeah.  That's true, yeah.  And doesn't honor things they promised you. 
[02:39:30]  They're your boss now.  People saying, best pot talk week ever.  Ah, yeah.  It was a lot of pot talk.  We had some fine breaks this week.  Just going off.  What?  You performing tonight?  Yes.  I will be in the comedy shop in Ringwood, New Jersey.  Ringworm?  What?  Ringwood, New Jersey.  Look, I'm reading this like a manifesto.  They used to be at a gig there, too.  What's the name of the place the comedy shop's at?  It's going to be at the Prime 15 Steakhouse and Grill.  Oh.  Yeah, it's going through the roof, isn't it? 
[02:40:00]  Uh, 15 Greenwood Lake Turnpike in Ringwood.  Come on down.  Ringwood.  Go see Joseph T. Curry.  Drink after the show.  I love to drink.  After the show.  After the show.  But your comedy is fantastic, too, man.  Yeah, come on.  Please, come on down.  Who are you working with?  Um, let's see.  It doesn't say here.  Fan?  Yeah.  Nathaniel, uh...  But, uh, yeah, come on down.  It's in Ringwood, New Jersey.  It'll be a pistol.  We'll have a good time.  Yeah, if you're in the area.  Check it out, man.  You'll have a really good time.  Joe Curry.  Sure. 
[02:40:30]  Sure.  Look at his feet.  They're huge.  Ted in Virginia.  Ted.  Yes, Gregory.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Virginia is for lovers.  It's my favorite bumper sticker.  I put them all over my windshield.  Why?  You can't put them on your windshield, then?  I know that.  I rode into a school bus.  It was like a yellow box full of bloody disappointment.  Sorry, Ted.  I'm sorry, Ted. 
[02:41:00]  Ted?  Yes, Gregory.  No.  We did this bit already.  My ears hurt.  Call with a fake name next time.  Okay, that's smart.  Hey, so now that you've got a clean bill of health, are you done with the whole trying  to be a better person bit?  No.  It's tiring to be an asshole 24 hours a day.  I still have it in me to be an asshole, but I don't know.  I'm on a good road right now.  What are you talking about? 
[02:41:30]  I'm reading a positive thinking book.  Is it I Hate Your Guts?  I'm on a different road, my friend.  What can I tell you?  More cake stomping?  Well, yesterday I was an asshole, so I still have it in me, but we're not really talking  about that right now.  Nah, it's really tiring, and it's lonely.  Your phone doesn't ring much.  Jesus.  Boy, I wonder why no one calls me. 
[02:42:00]  Boy, maybe it's time to look inside yourself.  Do you know what line from fucking...  Guess what?  My phone's starting to ring a little bit.  It's kind of nice.  Fuck, thanks to do.  Now I can not answer it.  Yeah, now I'll go back to that.  Yeah, voicemail.  Fuck you.  What line I always remember from Billy Crystal's Mr. Saturday Night?  It was a great line.  What's he talking like, dude?  I'm a black jazz musician.  Shut up.  No.  Oh, you bore.  It was...  I'm just chiming in. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Well...  What line do you remember?  All eyes are on you.  The brother was yelling at...  Because he hadn't gone that far in his career.  He was like a middle-of-the-road comic.  He had been famous, but then he kind of...  Buddy somebody kind of fell off because he was such a dick.  And the brother said, you're where you are because of who you are.  I thought that was such a great line.  Like, so many people fuck things up because of who they are.  And it's like...  I always remember, like, Dad, don't be a fucking cocksucker to people.  But that's where you are. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, then that's how you get where you are.  No, but he was mad that he hadn't gone further.  He hadn't...  Yeah.  Gotten further.  So he's like...  And then...  I was in New Orleans when Kachina came in, but I still got my trumpet.  Hey, hey, yeah.  Yuck.  That is not funny.  The guy is supposed to be doing something funny.  He's not this poignant, fake, black guy fucking stereotype.  He doesn't even sound like that, though.  You don't even do a good impression of it.  I think I couldn't possibly do an impression that badly. 
[02:43:30]  You know, it almost appears that Kenny forgot my Diet Pepsi, in which case, I would like  him to please unforget it.  Oh, shit.  He was a star yesterday, and now he's back to fetching stuff.  He's delegating.  I don't need Kenny to get it, just to fucking...  He just delegated responsibility to one of the interns.  How does it feel that yesterday you were a big radio star and today you're back to fetching  stuff?  I do what I do best. 
[02:44:00]  What is that?  Well, I'm told.  Lumber around.  I'm orders.  I like to give them and get them.  Do you need more of that compound stuff you were talking about yesterday?  Dr. Jimmy's two-ball compound.  Yeah, for my scratchy throat.  Does it hurt?  Is it stingy throat?  No, it just sounds like a little hoarse.  Do you ask Kenny if something hurts?  What's wrong with you?  Well, yeah, he is impervious.  He could burn his hand.  He wouldn't even know what's happening.  I'm impervious to pain. 
[02:44:30]  The only time you could ask him that, he'd say yes, is if he was reading.  Isn't he terrific?  He's very entertaining.  Do you have mucus in the back that feels like you can't swallow it?  No.  Good.  It's a good sign.  Yeah.  You want to hear what they had to say about your mashup demo while you're here, or you  need to get the coke?  No, I'd love to.  Kenny.  Crush.  Kill.  Destroy.  Crush.  Kill.  Destroy.  Let's do this. 
[02:45:00]  That was the evil robot from Lost in Space.  Yeah.  Hopefully you heard Kenny try out for the morning mashup yesterday.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Wait.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and ONA security force, Club Soda Kenny, has been looking to  become a real-life radio disc jockey.  He made a demo for his very favorite show, The Morning Mashup, and luckily for him, we 
[02:45:30]  found Ryan and Nicole from the mashup and got a chance to play Kenny's demo for them.  We're here with Ryan and Nicole from The Morning Mashup.  Are you guys ready to listen to Kenny's demo?  Ready as ever, dude.  Yeah, we've been talking about this for a couple days.  He keeps building it up and building it up, so we can't wait to hear it.  All right, here we go.  I'm crazy, Kenny, king of the mashup.  You know what Nicole and a police car have in common?  They both make a lot of noise to let you know they're coming.  So that was his kind of interaction with you, Nicole. 
[02:46:00]  I always kind of felt that fire trucks were a little louder and more like Nicole.  Kenny, first of all, you're not the king of the mashup.  Okay.  Not even close.  Love you, but you're not.  And yeah, Kenny, this might be a little too X-rated for our channel, honey.  I'm a little worried for you.  Don't worry.  There's some more.  Seriously, Ryan, what sexual position produces the ugly kids?  Why don't we ask your mom?  Here's the black guy peas with boom, boom, pow. 
[02:46:30]  Kenny, I thought you would know you were there.  So are you guys surprised that he decided to take this route with his demo?  I mean, he is a legitimate fan of your show.  I am surprised.  I thought he was for real, and if he really was a fan, he would know that this is completely inappropriate, Kenny.  He's funnier than I thought he would be.  Can we demo his 4-1-1 report for you?  I would love to hear Kenny's 4-1-1.  John and Kate Plus 8 are all over the news. 
[02:47:00]  I hope they're breaking up, because I'd like to finger bang Kate.  She'd start complaining.  Oh, your ring hurts.  I'd say, honey, that's not my ring.  That's my wristwatch, you know, because after eight kids, she's got a big cunt.  So what's, like, your guys' initial reaction after hearing the 4-1-1?  I think you just officially are not going to be the fifth member of the mashup after that little brigade, Kenny.  Oh, no.  I just hope that Kenny doesn't wear his watch after it's where he said it was. 
[02:47:30]  Kenny, you're not going to be the fifth member, but I love you.  After three demos failing miserably, what will Kenny do next?  If the answer is anything besides blowing his brains out, he may be making a mistake.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  My favorite part of that was watching Nicole's good humor fade.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That whole thing that, hey, guys, that whole thing just turned into, oh, my God.  Kenny's a pig. 
[02:48:00]  Fucking pig.  Yeah.  What a piece of shit.  You couldn't have made it sexy?  Like, oh, I wouldn't mind taking her out for a date.  After eight kids, you got a big cunt.  Back to you.  Back to you.  Yeah, and then she was just like, I, I, I, I.  Which Lady Gaga song are we going to play?  I don't, um, I don't see.  I, I, I.  Yeah, but now we got the Hollywood 4-1-1s with Club Soda Kenny.  That's going to be a regular feature.  And is he going to do another demo now?  Kenny, what's the next challenge to try out for?  Yeah, what do you think?  You got one in mind? 
[02:48:30]  Well, I'll have to discuss with my producer, Primetime, and my board op, Troy Kwan, and see  what we come up with.  But he doesn't want to be called a board op.  Well, what, what is he?  I don't know.  He sits there at a desk and he pushes buttons.  He's an engineer.  That could be any op that talks to Kenny.  Yeah.  A board op?  I'm sorry.  I have a bagel in my arm.  I have a bagel in my arm.  I kind of like that.  I, I like Troy.  He's got ink.  So you're going to have Troy decide?  Is that ink?  Troy and Sam? 
[02:49:00]  Oh, tats.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And like he, like his corner where his desk is, that's like the Cool's Kid Club.  Like all people like congregate there.  Ah.  Yep.  The Cool's Kid Club.  Kids Club.  Good.  Uncle Paul.  All right.  Boy likes cool cigarettes.  Yeah.  Troy Kwan Twitters.  Twitters.  Yeah.  Everybody Twitters.  Who doesn't?  He was shocked up with two broads last week.  He Twittered all about it.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I saw the pictures to prove it. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  He was eating on a terrace somewhere over here and then he went over there with the other  one.  Well, that sounds unbelievable, Ope.  Yeah.  It sure does.  Yeah.  But whatever you'd like.  Maybe.  Would you like a request something?  You, you, Sam and Troy, you know.  Yeah.  You want me to do some heavy metal?  I can do it all.  Whatever you want.  I think Hair Nation.  Hair Nation could be fun.  Do a little Hair Nation.  Hair Nation.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:50:00]  The hair on their head.  Ah!  We're talking about, yeah, Hair Nation, the hair band songs from like the 80s and stuff.  Perfect.  You know, and then you can intro those and add in maybe some popular culture from the day,  from the 80s, things like that.  Oh, maybe some old 80s clips or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that's what, uh, that's what I hear like Martha Quinn do on the 80s channel. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, they got all the old VJs on there doing all the, so you're making quite a face there,  Ope.  It looks like you're in, it looks like you're taking, getting a biopsy.  My ass still hurts from the biopsy.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, that's all it is.  Oh, because I bring up people like Martha Quinn and see, there goes that face again.  Boy, that was worth the money, huh, guys?  Is she still hot looking?  And Alan Hunter? 
[02:51:00]  No, she's probably real old now.  I don't know.  I haven't seen her.  You don't think she's the cute pixie or whatever the fuck that is?  Well, that's what she was.  She was like the little pixie, kind of naive girl.  Did you ever think she was hot when we saw her growing up?  The other one, the blonde was like...  Nina Blackwood.  Nina was the slutty.  She knew the streets.  She knew the bands.  She was a hooker in Vice Squad.  She got beaten to death by Wings Houser.  Wings Houser did a great job of beating her in that.  Fantastic.  Open the door, Ginger. 
[02:51:30]  I just want to love you.  Yeah.  And she opens the door and he goes, I cannot believe how stupid you are.  And then he beats her to death with a pimp stick.  I love you, Ramron!  Ramron.  It's great.  Kills her.  He said, you're not going to be giving my money maker away for a long time.  Because she was holding out on him.  Of course.  Pimp's got to beat a bitch.  Ginger.  While we have a lot of people in the studio right now, I got a question.  As long as we say it's on the air, we're okay, right?  I don't need human resources.  But something's going on in SiriusXM today. 
[02:52:00]  Is it show off your tits Friday?  For real?  I'm the only one that noticed?  A few of the ladies are...  They're fucking...  Revealing?  Sam?  It's Summer Fridays.  Don't get too specific, because it'll probably get us in trouble.  But there's at least one without a bra.  Mm-hmm.  And some deep cleavage happening.  E-Rock?  Kenny, you notice?  Always with the tit joke.  Keep it vague, though.  No, they've got very lovely ladies around here. 
[02:52:30]  But today, they're showing them off, it seems like.  Jim?  I've been playing grab-ass since 6.30.  Every time a bitch walks by this window, I grab a crack.  You know what Jimmy says, if you got them, flaunt them.  Jimmy does say that.  Be more funny.  When Jimmy wants to wreck the flow of something.  All right, we're going to have some fun now.  We're going to play. 
[02:53:00]  What do you want to do with Anthony Cumia?  What?  I like this game.  Me too.  I give you choices.  Oh, oh, what do you want to do?  Yeah, lady.  And then with Anthony Cumia.  Yeah, yeah.  Not what do you want to do with Anthony Cumia.  Oh, me, like.  You make it sound like, yeah.  Jesus, I almost yelled, suck his cock and fuck his face.  Fuck.  That would have been embarrassing.  What do I agree to do with Jimmy Norton?  Let me tell you me, my friend.  Okay, jokes just rule.  I know.  People want the whole Hollywood 411 from yesterday.  Can we get that for the guys? 
[02:53:30]  They want to hear Kenny's 411 one more time.  He's going to do another one next week.  All right.  Lady Gaga talking about Dick.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Iron Sheik versus drinking out of cups made by our intern Charlie.  Mm-hmm.  What would management say the home game?  Oh.  Or.  That's an old bit, right?  Yeah.  I heard it this morning.  Yeah, I think I heard that already.  I heard it this morning online.  Yeah, Steve's now putting, I guess, bits on his website before they even play on the 
[02:54:00]  air.  And then he told me he time-coded it and there was a mistake.  And he lies about it in tweets.  Yeah.  What do you mean the bit was on any website before it was on the air?  Exactly.  It was on Foundry before.  So I asked him about it.  He goes, oh, I time-coded it so that wasn't supposed to go up there until after the show  today.  But then someone brought to my attention that he tweeted that that bit was now up there  for everyone's listening pleasure.  Was the tweet posted retroactively? 
[02:54:30]  Steve!  Can you do that?  Is there an option for that?  Let's just ask.  I don't want to throw the guy into the bus without asking.  Yes.  We should at least get his side of it.  You can't just.  We don't need to.  Or the top 20 special needs movie characters ever.  Whoa.  Is it serious or are they trying to be funny?  Serious.  That's funny.  Then that's funny.  If they were trying to be funny, it wouldn't be funny.  You want to go with this?  Serious is funny.  Yeah, I want to go with that.  I like that.  Where's Steve? 
[02:55:00]  Where's Steve?  Where's Steve?  Why isn't he making his way down the hallway?  Where's Steve?  Yes.  I'm very, very busy.  Why doesn't he run barrel?  What is this?  Let's see.  See?  Am I lying?  If you're lying, you'll die.  It's Moby.  Oh, good news, though.  He took the one that you guys didn't play down but left the other one out.  I have to burp.  Oh, this lady comes by.  I'm going to burp really loud.  Is it not out there?  Open the door.  Open the door.  Open the door.  Open the door.  Fuck.  Too late. 
[02:55:30]  They must just think we're animals.  We are.  Is the radio on out there?  Oh, yeah.  What happened to little Nicky?  Where's little Nicky?  Where's little Nicky?  You were thinking the same thing.  I got scared.  I thought that little Nicky cut his hair.  Steve, what happened with the POFA today?  I'm supposed to be able to put these up and have that update automatically at a certain time,  and apparently that functionality is not available, so I went and took it down. 
[02:56:00]  So what you wanted to happen was, you post it, and then at a certain time after we've played it, it automatically kicks onto the site, and you can then...  It's like a day later.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Yeah.  A day later.  Yeah, if I dated, it should be a day later.  All right.  Then how come...  Why can't you just tell the truth?  There's a Twitter...  Oh, because I posted the other ones, too.  I posted...  I posted... 
[02:56:30]  The whole updates are supposed to show up afterwards.  The what?  These updates are supposed to show up afterwards.  I just have a question.  It's a very legitimate question.  Yeah.  Why are you even posting these anyway?  Because I can every once in a while.  Well, if you want me to.  Well, if there's no...  But I'm saying, if there's no opianthony.com, why are you putting them up on track?  You're out...  You know what?  I'm just asking.  I had a hand in making them.  I can post them if I want.  If you'd rather I didn't, I won't.  I don't really think that's the case.  I don't think you could take...  Something I had a hand in making and share it with people? 
[02:57:00]  Well, there's some things that we have a hand in making that we're not allowed to post.  Sure.  Absolutely.  You know what?  Sam had an interview with Method Man and some other rap stars that he could not post.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't post them.  Why can't you?  I can't post them on my personal.  Why not?  Because they happened here.  It's their material.  Yeah, so they won't...  Oh, and I would think that a production piece that is made specifically for the Opian Anthony  show would be exclusive content to air on the Opian Anthony show. 
[02:57:30]  I'm not comfortable with that stuff being put up on the site.  Okay.  To be completely honest with you.  All right, then I will...  I'm not very comfortable with that.  Then I'll take it down.  Yeah.  I won't put it up.  All right.  That just makes me...  Problem solved.  You know, I feel a little better.  All right.  Yeah, and Steve, just because you voiced something doesn't make you part of the promo.  Like, that was written by an intern.  I know it was written part of my intern.  It was produced by Derek.  This is the part where Danny accuses me of taking credit for other people's shit. 
[02:58:00]  Like, it doesn't happen, Steve?  No.  You really want to go down this road today?  Yes, I do, because it's incorrect, and you are blatantly lying right now.  Okay.  So, anyway...  So, how about all those other times when Derek makes a production piece, and then you write  your name on it?  Derek and Steve?  Because my voice is on it.  I wrote it.  All right, dude.  I'm not going to argue with you today, but...  No, you're not, because you're going to lose.  Like all the other arguments I've lost to you in the past.  Yeah.  Several of them.  What?  You don't think I don't hear all the shit you say behind my back?  I don't care, Steve.  Well, good.  Because I do hear it.  Give me an example of what I say behind my back. 
[02:58:30]  No, I don't have to.  You know what?  That's my...  Well, you don't have to, but if you're going to accuse me of something, then you should  have the balls to back it up and say so.  It's not an accusation.  It's the truth.  Well, then, give me an example, Steve.  No, I'm not going to, because that's my privilege.  No, I don't lose.  You lose.  No, you've lost.  I can say whatever I want, and I don't have to back it up.  How about that?  No, because I happen to be this little hierarchy that exists here.  I'm above you.  And all the shitty little things you say behind my back, I find out about.  So what?  So what?  Am I supposed to be afraid of something?  I'm not asking you to be afraid.  I'm the one that has to write your fucking review. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, which...  Yeah, I know, and that seems really fair, don't it?  Yeah.  And just by you saying that, basically, you're basically saying that you're going to write  me a bad review.  No.  And you're not going to take my work ethic into consideration.  I take your work ethic...  Because of the personal problems that we might have, you're going to give me an illegitimate  review.  You just said that.  No, I didn't.  Your work ethic is actually pretty good.  Your attitude...  It actually is?  Your attitude and your condescending remarks are completely uncalled for. 
[02:59:30]  When have I spoken to you in the last six months?  When you do speak to me, it is incredibly condescending and incredibly disrespectful.  Well, if you can give me an example of said...  I don't have to.  I don't have to.  Yes, you do, because you're accusing me of it, Steve.  No, I don't.  You know what?  If you're accusing me of it, then I want you to back it up, because I don't need you  running to management, telling him all this shit when it's never happened before.  It's not happened.  Since we've been in this building, I think I've said about seven words to you if it's  not work-related.  That's incorrect.  It is.  It is not incorrect.  I've seen the emails you've written to management, and I've seen the emails... 
[03:00:00]  What emails?  Show them.  Print them out.  No, I don't have to.  That's the wonderful thing about being me.  The other wonderful thing about being me...  You don't have to be accountable for anything?  No, I can be accountable for plenty, but I'm not accountable to you, and that's the great  thing.  The other great thing is, I can end the conversation.  Adios.  Bye, Steve.  Bye.  I was just saying.  What happened?  I don't know.  Steve decided that he won his argument.  Well, that worked out.  Oh, my God. 
[03:00:30]  You should see what the fuck they're serving in the kitchen over there.  What happened?  I don't know.  I just got back, too.  Anything?  I figured I could slip out.  Me and Steve don't get a walk.  Well, but I didn't miss anything.  You and Steve are really...  Well, you can't say anything about his website, or else he gets very sensitive.  Yes.  Very sensitive, indeed.  I don't think it's, um...  You know.  Oh, no.  I don't like surprise guests.  I'll tell you the truth.  We have a surprise guest.  She got one who it is.  It's never...  It's never a good surprise guest. 
[03:01:00]  I don't want a surprise...  Danny, do you know?  What's Danny doing?  I don't know.  Danny's storming in.  Oh, they're closing the curtains.  Get a mic over there.  Oh, my God.  Wait, hold on.  I'll open up the curtains.  I don't give a shit about the surprise guests right now.  I'll be able to surprise.  No, I don't care, because Danny just marched down the hall to continue the argument.  Didn't anyone else figure that out?  Yeah, of course.  We can't see down there, though.  He ain't going to help with the surprise guest.  Where's Sam in the microphone?  Sam's back there.  They won't let Sam put a Method Man interview up? 
[03:01:30]  Oh, my God.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Look who's here.  I can't see.  Let's play a game with the audience.  Guess?  Yeah.  We'll make him have a fake name.  Okay.  We'll make him use a fake voice.  Okay.  And then...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't say anything.  Sam.  Tell him to use a fake voice.  Yeah.  Put on his best fake voice, and then we'll ask him questions and see if the audience can 
[03:02:00]  guess who the mystery guest is.  They probably wouldn't even recognize him if he used his regular voice.  I know, but it's one of those things I'd rather just in case, because the listeners  are pretty sharp.  But what about our top 20 special needs movie characters ever?  I already read the list.  Two of them just walked out of the studio.  What happened with Danny? 
[03:02:30]  He's in...  I left him in Steve's office.  He had to continue the conversation.  Yeah.  He went right into Steve's office.  Yeah.  Maybe backstage with ONA should cover this.  Dude, how can we not be getting an audio of that?  I know.  Backstage with ONA has to cover this.  Go ahead.  All right.  Now, sir, I'm just going to call you Mystery Guest.  Mystery Guest.  Mystery Guest.  Use a fake voice.  Use a fake voice.  Your best fake voice.  Mystery Guest.  What have you been up to? 
[03:03:00]  Hello.  I've been up to just, you know, hanging around, working at home, you know, hanging out a  little bit.  Yeah, Mystery Guest?  Yes.  All right.  Your hair looks good.  Thank you.  Everyone is stumped.  Yeah, talk a little more.  Wow.  Mystery Guest.  So far, no one's gotten it.  No one knows who I am yet? 
[03:03:30]  No.  No.  What are you doing for work, Mystery Guest?  Are you a famous comedian?  No, I am not a famous comedian.  No.  Mystery Guest, are you a television star?  No, I am not a television star.  No.  Oh, okay.  Are you a movie star?  Did you play, like, a special needs character?  No, I've never been on a movie ever in my entire life.  They are all stumped, these people.  Yeah, so weird.  I'm fine.  One person's got the answer yet. 
[03:04:00]  I'm looking, every phone line is lit, and they all have the wrong answer.  Really?  No one can guess who this is.  Should we give them a little hint or a clue?  Yes.  Yes.  You come up with a little clue.  I'll give a hint.  A little clue.  Awful.  I'm kidding, of course.  I know you are, but that is a good clue.  Well, that's a good fake voice, too.  All right.  Give them a little clue.  Still looking at the phones, not one person got it in.  No, not one person has it.  I'm trying to come up with a good clue that won't give it away so easily.  Yeah, yeah.  Make it a very, very vague clue. 
[03:04:30]  That's a good clue.  That was one right there.  The inability to improv.  Let's see.  Come up with a good clue.  Go.  Yeah, go.  Good clue.  Right away.  I'm 26 years old.  That's a great clue.  All right, that is.  We just found a good clue.  That was a great clue.  Ah.  So, um, how did you get here today, Mystery Guest? 
[03:05:00]  Uh, on a train.  Oh, on a train.  And where did that train start?  The train started in New Jersey.  New Jersey.  New Jersey.  All right, I'm going to guess.  I'm going to guess.  All right.  Is this Mystery Guest Bruce Springsteen?  No.  It is not Bruce Springsteen.  No.  That's a good guess.  TV star, but I didn't say musical star. 
[03:05:30]  Good guess.  Can I ask a question?  Yes, please.  What's your name?  Should I say that?  Is it time?  Is it?  No, you're still Mystery Guest.  You're still Mystery Guest.  All right.  As soon as we get one person.  There hasn't been one person that guessed yet?  Not one.  Are you serious?  Is it a real?  Wow.  No.  Your fake voice is throwing everyone off.  The fake voice has got everyone.  That's amazing.  I thought my clue that would give it away.  Which one? 
[03:06:00]  I'm 26 years old.  No, but I think the voice is so good that people can't figure it out.  Yeah, it is.  They don't remember how old you are.  Mystery Guest.  Do you think that your normal voice is a very distinctive voice?  My normal voice?  Yes.  If I talked in my normal voice, they would guess immediately.  But with this voice, no one has it.  How many of them follow?  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.  We're looking at over a dozen phone lines.  A lot of people saying Black Earl.  What are the guesses?  What are the guesses?  A lot of people saying Big A. 
[03:06:30]  I'm giving you the guesses, you dope.  What are the other ones?  Yeah.  Big A.  Black Earl.  Big A.  Bobo.  Dave.  Not the old Dave.  Dave from Ron and Fez.  Eastside Dave.  Yeah, yeah.  And then that creepy guy with the googly eyes.  Yeah.  Who's he?  He's the creepy guy with the googly eyes from Ron and Fez.  Crazed.  Oh, crazed.  Crazed. 
[03:07:00]  Wow.  How about another clue, Mystery Guest?  Okay.  Um, what's the top, uh, I don't know, uh, I live in New Jersey.  Ah.  And you're 26?  Uh, South Orange, New Jersey is the exact town in New Jersey.  Ah.  Ah, okay.  Does that help?  South Orange might help, um.  26 years old. 
[03:07:30]  Fez?  No.  No, I'm not Fez.  God, what the hell is going on?  Jay Moore's coming in a lot.  Yeah, because Jay does a lot of voices.  Do an impression of somebody.  I bet you you do the impression.  Let's see if it's Jay.  All right, that's good.  Do an impression of Christopher Walken.  Yeah, do any type of impression.  Any celebrity.  Mystery guest.  Christopher Walken?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh.  Hey, it's a Christopher Walken. 
[03:08:00]  Holy shit.  Wow, that's good.  Do another one.  Damn it, that's good.  To a T.  I'm starting to think a, uh.  Now look, they're going Frank Caliendo.  Is it, sir, are you Frank Caliendo?  No.  Oh.  Damn it.  Fuck.  Show us this bit with Caliendo.  They really don't know?  No, they don't know, mystery guest.  Why don't you leave the studio?  We're going to go to the phones in a few minutes and let them guess.  Okay.  Goodbye.  Think of another clue outside the studio.  Yeah, there he goes.  There goes our mystery guest. 
[03:08:30]  Not one call.  Someone guessing Tippy Tom.  That's a very good guess.  Yeah.  Not one call has it.  How does nobody get that?  It's really weird.  I don't know, Jimmy.  Very strange.  Here's the bit that everyone heard because, uh, you know, they went to Steve's website.  Uh-huh.  We didn't even get to debut it.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam.  Yes, Eric.  Want to go out to the bar and meet some chicks?  No.  Want to oil up?  Try on some singlets and rustle?  No, weirdo.  Want to have a beach party with a bunch of naked, coped-up strippers playing volleyball  and dittling one another? 
[03:09:00]  Sure.  Wait a minute.  What would management say?  Management says no.  Staging a public event of this magnitude involving exotic dancers and illegal substances would  alert the authorities and cause a rift with the community.  Fucking assholes.  With what would management say, the home version, you can enjoy the injection of milquetoast  opinions into your evening of shenanigans.  What better way to fuck up a night of hijinks than finding out what some boring asshole in  a suit has to say about a concept that he couldn't have possibly come up with on his  own.  Fuck this game. 
[03:09:30]  Fuck it.  Take it back.  You can't.  Once you purchase what would management say, the home version, you're locked into a binding,  exclusive 12-month-long contract that prohibits you from playing any other games except  this one under the penalty of litigation.  Fuck this.  Order today.  It's not bad.  They need one more really good scenario.  Dan, where'd you go?  Very good, though.  Danny, what happened to you?  I thought you were helping with the mystery guest.  I had to have a chat.  Yeah.  It's all good now? 
[03:10:00]  Danny wouldn't let that sit.  It's all good now?  That's good to hear.  No.  It's more pissed every time he comes in.  Yeah.  Ant, it's to you, my friend.  Lady Gaga talking about Dick, Iron Sheik, Drinking Out of Cups, Made by Intern Charlie,  the versus thing there, or the top 20 special needs movie characters ever?  Oh, special needs.  Yeah.  Okay.  Let the guessing begin.  Can I go right for number one? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, go ahead.  Eric Diggle.  I'm sorry.  Because he's retarded.  He's not.  Special needs.  Now, I need a little clarification here.  Is this mentally retarded and or physically retarded?  I think they're pretty much going for the retards.  Going for the retards.  But you have to say special needs.  All right.  Then I will say...  Pretty much.  Juliet Lewis and the other sister. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, shit.  Give yourself a bell.  Number 19.  How stupid are they?  Are they just...  They don't know what five times five is, or they would use a porcupine to wipe their  ass?  What level of dumbness?  What level of stupid?  And I also have to go with Giovanni Ribisi in same movie.  The other sister.  Come on.  He plays a great retard in that.  I want to get married to you.  I want to get married. 
[03:11:30]  I got to get my game show sounds.  All retards always want to get married.  Hey, Dan, where's my game show sounds?  Well, I did.  Makes sense now.  That's the wrong question.  Dummies.  Guess that was a lovely affair.  You're allowed to guess as long as you don't come up with number one.  You're in custody of your chromosome.  What, you want to guess one?  Yeah, wasn't Rosie O'Donnell in some tard movie?  I said not to come up with number one!  Oh, sorry.  Was that number one?  Number one.  What was it called?  Oh, good.  Fucker. 
[03:12:00]  Riding the bus with my sister.  The number one special needs movie character ever.  She was hilarious in this.  When she played a clip on her show of that fucking abomination of a tard movie.  And the audience, when she came on the screen, the audience went, aww.  Like, oh, she's so cute.  But what is the classic tard movie?  How could you?  Yeah, yeah.  Do we have any clips of that?  Because she did sound like Pee Wee.  There was no little yellow bus? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, it was great.  What about Bill?  Is Bill on there?  Hold on a minute.  I can't see it.  Give yourself a plug for coming up with the number one answer.  Yay!  I'll be at the Comedy Shop in Ringwood, New Jersey tonight.  Call up 973-831-9494.  They don't remember phone numbers.  No.  Okay.  Just come on down.  Ringwood, New Jersey.  There you go.  Which one in?  Uh, I said...  This would probably be my favorite and probably yours, right? 
[03:13:00]  Really?  Bill.  Yes.  It's not on the list.  That was Bill not on there.  God, Gump has got it on the list.  I was at the institution and they were mean to me and I lost my teeth and they would kick  me in the guts.  Good.  Good for you, you dummy.  I, to this day...  Wild Bill's Coffee Shop.  Who wants to fucking retard hands in your coffee?  Ew, he wanted to start a coffee shop?  Yes.  He did at the school because the school was like, we can't have them around. 
[03:13:30]  You know, there's going to be a liability of this.  So they were like, we can figure out a way.  And they played this to retard music and they showed a montage of them building something  and then they unveiled a sign that's Wild Bill's Coffee Shop.  And they're like, Bill, this is your coffee shop.  And he proceeded to shit one of the pots.  Did he?  No.  And they only sold tea.  It was fucking dumb.  It was his dark roast.  Stirs the coffee with his tongue.  Here you go.  He's pissing in it.  He's burning himself constantly because he puts his bare hands in the pot because he thinks  there's treasure in it. 
[03:14:00]  Fucking lummox.  Treasure.  Dude, these girls are showing off their boobs today.  I'm telling you, E-Rock, what do you know about the girls showing off their boobs today  at this Sirius XM facility?  I don't know.  That's Madison.  Ooh.  Oh, that is?  Yeah.  From who?  E-Rock.  Is something going on today?  Does it show off your tits Friday or what?  No.  And the weather pretty much blows ass.  I know.  That's what I understand.  So it's not even nice out.  Hurry up, E-Rock.  We got the Rosie O'Donnell.  Oh, goody.  We're going to do this list until we get the top five. 
[03:14:30]  Jimmy did Forrest Gump.  We got that in number six.  So we got one out of the top five so far.  How many out of the top five?  You want a Rosie O'Donnell clip?  Fuck yeah.  Which one do you want?  Any one.  She's hysterically stupid.  I don't know which ones are good on this.  We haven't played this in years.  Let's see some of the names.  La-da-dee.  On the phone.  Argument up the stairs.  On the bus.  You drive a toilet.  Uncomfortable.  Oh, Uncomfortable Passenger.  Yeah, anything on the bus.  That's a good one.  She's a dunce through the whole thing.  All right. 
[03:15:00]  Funeral scene might be good.  Yeah.  All right.  Where she's got to interact with real, normal people that shouldn't be shot at birth.  I think the bus ones are good.  This wasn't supposed to be a comedy, right?  No.  Sometimes I get confused.  That was supposed to be a serious movie.  It's based on a true story.  You can't watch a tarred movie and not laugh.  I know.  Come on.  Every day, you're a first person on my bus.  Yeah.  You'd kill somebody to get on first. 
[03:15:30]  I wouldn't.  I wouldn't kill.  It's got no place to go.  It just rides around all day.  So, it's a free country.  I'm a person.  I buy my bus pads for 40 bucks, and I'm first always, so that's why I'm first.  Yeah, you're doing it on the government dole.  I want you to do something useful in your life.  Okay, Henry.  Where is Beth going today?  I'm going to go to Alma.  Now, I'm going to catch a bus with Rick.  Ah, Rick is your new favorite.  Yeah, because he has a green card. 
[03:16:00]  He's cute.  A green Mustang.  Very close.  You know she lost the voice there?  Yep.  Yeah, yeah.  You got that, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  She just went into regular fat Rosie O'Donnell.  How about you do another take?  Listen to her completely lose the voice she's putting on.  A green card.  He's cute.  A green Mustang.  Very classy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he's going to take me for a ride in it.  What about your boyfriend?  Jesse.  Like Tom and Louise.  Jesse's delicious.  He's going to take me today to get a new toilet seat because mine got broken. 
[03:16:30]  It was sliding.  It's a hatch.  It's a hatch.  It's a hatch.  It's a hatch.  It's a hatch.  It's a hatch.  Toilet seat.  It's a hatch.  She keeps putting them on her head, wondering why her head's getting wet.  Get me a new toilet seat.  Didn't we say?  Yeah.  It's like a female peewee.  It's a...  There was some...  Ah, whatever.  How come it only keeps my forehead and ears dry?  Because you dumb cunt.  It's a toilet seat.  Your hat doesn't have a lid on it, stupid. 
[03:17:00]  That was the worst fucking movie ever made.  She's fucking hilarious.  Why don't we guess another character?  Please go here one more rosy clip.  Please just one more.  We're going to like segment it out.  We're going to do a little weaving.  Bobbin and weaving here.  Let's see.  Think retard.  Let it be known.  Think retard.  Ben Stiller in Tropic Thunder.  Simple Jack.  Didn't make the list.  Shut up.  Of course it should have.  For retard.  Go ahead.  I'm trying to think of another good retard.  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Come on. 
[03:17:30]  Come on.  Sean Penn.  Come on.  I am Sam.  Jimmy, give yourself a bell.  I'd love a bell.  Thank you.  That's number what?  Fourteen.  Sean Cassidy.  No.  I'll just not be there.  Fuck.  How old are you?  Jesus.  I know.  That was an old one.  Which one is it?  That was another one.  We're going to marry.  Which one was it for real?  Raja.  I can't remember the name.  Was it an after school special or something?  I think I know.  Josh Brolin in W. 
[03:18:00]  Come on.  There's one we talk about all the time on the show.  All the time.  All the time.  Rich Fawc.  Rich Fawc and everything.  Gilbert Grape.  Gilbert Grape.  Leonardo DiCaprio, number two.  Oh!  God damn, give yourself a bell.  How is Gump number four after fucking Rosie?  I got the boss. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, is it time for another Rosie Club?  Yes.  Oh, fuck yes.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Give up.  Give up.  Big dummy she is.  She shot at her.  I'm my savior.  Huh?  I'm not your savior.  I'm just Beth.  Cool Beth.  Oh.  You know how bad her pussy would stink?  Oh, that's boring clothes.  What am I scaring you? 
[03:19:00]  What made it scaring you?  Boo, boo, boo!  Beth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bear no mind.  This is a harmless retard.  Just don't make eye contact.  I'm hearing you!  So, Rick, when are you going to take me for a ride in your car?  In a green car?  My case worker.  Oh, Olivia.  Yes, Olivia?  When I want to burn it for the insurance.  She's nice.  How about when you're not stupid? 
[03:19:30]  That's when I'll take you for a ride.  She'll be sticking her head up and we're doing like a safe benign.  I think we talked to him.  I don't think he's a jerk.  I think he's a little impatient.  I'll take you for a ride.  I'll only put that sign in the bathroom that says only employees can use it.  That didn't stop you, though, did it?  No, because I'm a person and it's just a bathroom.  If I use it, I don't think I'm hurting anybody.  Okay!  Sometimes I go in there and if I don't have to go to the bathroom,  just to wash my hands, I'll make them mad.  Well?  Well? 
[03:20:00]  Ah!  Okay!  Ah!  Ah!  Morning, Mr. Beckford!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Don't laugh at me!  Don't laugh at me!  Travis is saying that she sounds like Susan Waldman.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen! 
[03:20:30]  Oh, she's awful.  Horrendous.  Oh, going with the list again?  Good.  All right.  This list sucks, by the way.  Carl.  Carl from Sling Blade.  There you go, Ed.  Back on track.  He wasn't really retarded, was he?  Yeah.  Billy Bob Thornton, number four.  Oh, no.  He buried his fucking little brother alive?  Boy, that boy lives in his own heart.  That's an awful big place for a... 
[03:21:00]  It's like fucking profound thought coming out of that motherfucker.  Yeah, but he probably meant literally.  He thought he actually lived in a giant organ.  And fucking dumb he is.  Swings a lawnmower blade and then eats biscuits.  He's a fool.  Biscuits and mustard.  God damn it, someone's got the mystery guest.  Got something in there that's good to eat.  What was Sling Blade?  Number four.  Ooh, four.  So we have number four.  We have number two.  We have number one.  Yeah, we just need three and five.  A couple more guesses.  What was Gump? 
[03:21:30]  Gump was six.  Wow.  Gump was six.  How the fuck is Rosie above Billy Bob?  Shut up.  Stupid list.  That's ridiculous.  We realized a long time ago these lists suck, right?  What's this?  What's this?  Bill the movie?  Bill gets the...  Bill Clips.  But is it real Bill or is it that Bill...  Made for TV movie?  Yeah, it was made for TV.  Television?  What was the TV Clips?  What was the other Bill?  Hold on, man.  There's a Bill on his own, which was the sequel. 
[03:22:00]  I know.  And that sucked.  Is this the first one?  It wasn't Andy Rooney?  I mean, uh...  It was...  You ever notice how a retarded guy can't make coffee, right?  Put his dick in it.  Do you ever notice how much it hurts when you put your tongue in the socket expecting candy?  Do you ever notice, no matter who cuts the hair, it always looks like Bo from the Three Stooges?  Do you ever notice how hard the adults cry after you put the pillow over the baby's face for too long? 
[03:22:30]  Do you ever notice how the camera goes slightly off-center when a retard's in the picture?  Do you ever notice how people come up to you with baseballs and ask for an autograph?  Pete Rose.  Yeah.  Nice.  Do you ever notice when you go to Shea Stadium, they let you right down on the field?  Mr. Matt.  Mr. Matt. 
[03:23:00]  Sean Cassidy was in a movie called...  Like Normal People.  That was it.  Like Normal People.  Here's a clip from Bill.  I got you this job at the Country Club to keep you out of trouble, remember?  I won't be in any trouble, Miss Keating.  Everything's all right.  Now I won't get pinched by the cops more.  Everything's onky-dory.  And the television.  I bought that so you can stay out of trouble, too.  The television, oh boy, that's...  I Dream of Jeannie, that's a cutie.  See, that's way better than Rosie O'Donnell.  It's not even on the list. 
[03:23:30]  I want to watch the I Dream of Jeannie show.  I forgot about that one.  He's come saying that.  Do you want Merry Christmas?  Just jerking off his old retarded dick to fucking I Dream of Jeannie  and then making coffee without washing his hands.  He would probably just poke his dumb dick through his pants  and just shoot a jackal all over the inside of his leg and feel ashamed  and go sit in a dark corner until it's dry.  Fucking dumbbell.  What a total idiot.  He wouldn't think people could see him jerking through his pants. 
[03:24:00]  If he didn't look down, he would figure they couldn't see it either.  Old stoop.  What a stoop he was.  Merry Christmas clip.  Bill for short.  Bill gets in a fight.  How old is Bill?  The Terry Pye song.  Oh, Bill.  The Terry Pye song.  Oh, God.  Bill kicked in the guts or dinnertime with the chicken.  Dinnertime with the chicken is great.  And then we'll do a song.  All right.  Let's do it.  I got to hear Dinnertime with the chicken.  Okay.  This was the one where the young aspiring filmmaker who has gotten Bill 
[03:24:30]  and he's making a movie about him decides to invite him to his very well-to-do  like Connecticut upper crusty stereotypical movie parents.  Uh, and he comes in, he's introduced, sits down to dinner, and a giant platter of chicken  comes out.  And with his disgusting retard picking his ass and balls fingers, he starts taking the  chicken and putting it on his plate and, uh, not stopping.  He just takes, like, every piece of chicken and then, and then, like, they make him put 
[03:25:00]  him, put it back like someone's going to eat it after he's touched it.  You wouldn't?  No!  I wouldn't be in the same house with this fucking thing.  Jesus, man.  Oh, hell, man.  You'd be in a different room.  Are you good and hungry?  I hope you are.  I'm good and hungry.  I like it.  It's good.  Are you a company?  I'm the president of one.  I'm kidding.  Green beans.  They're good for you.  I like green beans. 
[03:25:30]  Here, have, have a lot.  We've got plenty.  I like, I like green beans.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And some sweet potatoes?  Thirty.  He means one.  Oh, look at that chicken.  Isn't that good?  Help yourself, there's plenty.  Isn't that good chicken?  Hey, go easy on that.  It's good chicken.  Bill.  Bill is on a diet.  He's watching his weight because of his leg.  Isn't that right, Bill?  I'm not watching my weight now. 
[03:26:00]  Bill, put that back.  I'm going to have more chicken.  Put that back.  I want to have more chicken.  Bill, put that back.  Go talk to him, Barry.  No.  No.  No.  He's a fucking idiot.  I shouldn't have brought him here.  The best part.  Touched all the chicken.  He's all upset, though.  Yeah, he went into the kitchen and walked and stood in a corner.  That's what he should do.  Yeah, he should.  While the people are eating.  The corner of a trash compactor. 
[03:26:30]  Exactly.  Where's your food?  It's in the bowl on the floor.  Fight it out with the fucking pit bull.  Big fancy family.  My words, you're a retard, aren't you?  I know.  Did you hear it?  It's like, there's plenty, Bill.  And meanwhile, she had this disgusted look on her face.  It's like, oh, hi, Bill.  Give him a fork and a bowl of kibbles and bits.  See that big mansion with a little yellow bus in front of it?  They're visiting.  Just have him stand out in front with a lantern. 
[03:27:00]  Fucking dummy.  It's a lawn donkey.  One of the greatest show moments ever?  Yes.  Getting Dennis Quaid on the phone.  Yeah.  And only talking about this movie.  Only talking about Bill.  Yeah.  I don't think we ever asked him another question.  He said no one ever asked him about that movie.  Not a one.  What's the cherry pie song I have to hear?  Oh, well, I'm still holding back on that one, Jimmy.  We've got to get these people listening a little longer.  Oh, by the way, your chance to guess who the mystery guest is.  Yes.  Coming up in a few minutes. 
[03:27:30]  And I think we might even go into our prize closet if we have one.  Any more special needs movie character guesses?  How many more for the top five?  Two.  I don't think we're going to get the other two, any of us.  I really don't.  And I didn't see anybody get it on instant feedback or the phones.  Radio.  Radio's on the list.  Cube of a good engineer.  Number 10.  Do a couple more and then we'll just move on.  I think of retards.  Come on, dummies.  Like they have John Hedder from Napoleon Dynamite on the list. 
[03:28:00]  Number 8.  Really?  Retard?  It was just fucking spastic.  Warren from There's Something About Mary.  That was a great one.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Retard.  Uh, Kristen Stewart and the Cake Eaters.  Anyone?  Anyone?  No, I never saw that.  Anyone?  Anyone?  All right.  Number 7.  But that is something retards love to do.  Yes.  They love eating cake.  They love eating a whole cake.  You guys are missing.  It's easy because I got the list.  I know I'm doing a little Dick Clark thing here.  Yeah.  Um, there's at least one. 
[03:28:30]  Counting backwards from 10 wrong.  There's at least one more you guys should get.  Could you give us a hint?  Uh, uh, uh.  He was dumb.  Uh.  Guy or girl?  Guy.  All right.  It's a guy.  Uh.  What movie?  Let me think.  Oscar winner.  Uh, Rain Man?  Yeah.  I knew that would give it away.  Oh.  I thought of that anyway.  I just didn't consider him retarded, but I guess he was.  Uh, Molly Shannon, Superstar, Booger from Revenge of the Nerds is on the list. 
[03:29:00]  That's retarded.  Adam Sandler and Billy Madison.  Ugh.  John Malkovich, Mice and Men.  We should have probably got that of Mice and Men.  Robin Williams and Jack.  Elizabeth, Shue, and Molly.  Hank from Drop Dead Gorgeous.  And then finally for the top five, number three, uh, Sloth from Goonies.  I understand.  Oh.  I don't think we would have got that.  No.  I would have taken it forever.  Should have.  You think?  Yeah, I should have gotten that one.  And then, um, Hanson from Scary Movie 2.  Anyone? 
[03:29:30]  Anyone?  Anyone?  Hmm.  No, right?  I don't like the fucking stupidest movies.  Another dumb list.  But it brings material to the show, so.  And we get to hear the fucking song.  Yes.  Where have you gone, Billy Boy, Billy Boy?  Oh, no.  That song is fucking terrible.  Of course it is.  A big-headed dummy sings it.  You know what this is?  It's a microphone.  Well, it's a microphone, right?  Or mic for short.  Mic for short.  Mic.  Mic. 
[03:30:00]  Where have you been, Billy Boy?  Billy Boy?  Where have you been, darling Billy?  Abandoning you.  I've been down to the farm.  Didn't do no harm.  Can you make a cherry pie, darling Billy?  Harpo!  Ah-ha!  Wow, Bill. 
[03:30:30]  Boo!  Yeah, where have you been, Billy Boy?  Billy Boy?  Boo!  Where have you been, darling Billy?  Oh, my God!  I've been down to the farm and I didn't do no harm.  Can you make a cherry pie, darling Billy?  This sucks.  This sucks.  That was pretty good.  Arr!  I didn't even sell her. 
[03:31:00]  Okay, fruggett, what's next?  Stop talking and start sucking.  We got a bevy of good clips these days.  Finger my ass with those coffee grind hands, retard.  Oh, God damn.  Smells like Maxwell House and shit.  Chew my balls so it looks like cherry pie in your mouth.  You dunderhead. 
[03:31:30]  Here, hold my baby, lunkhead.  Throws it into the wall like Banchini.  There is a scene in Bill where they actually let Bill hold their new baby, too.  You probably ate it.  And they're all like nervous.  Take the big bite out of the soft spot.  Pudding!  Dummy.  Damn it.  Fucking baby brain.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, Stephen S. from Bayshore.  What about a normal guy played by a retard?  Anyone?  Think about it.  Think about it. 
[03:32:00]  Don't even say that stupid Life Goes On show in Corky.  No, he's going for a joke.  He's a retard.  Stephen S.  Oh.  Lenny Bruce as portrayed by the idiot Rich Voss.  Look at me thinking he actually had one.  Like, why would they hire a retard to play a regular guy?  Would be funny.  Before we bring the mystery guest.  I mean, as a businessman.  Right.  Like, he's supposed to be the president of a company.  He's just a bumbling fucking retard. 
[03:32:30]  We're going to bring the mystery guest back in.  Yes.  And have the listeners, not just in a moment, and then have the listeners try to figure out  who it is.  But Charlie worked hard on this, so let's give Charlie a little air time.  Intern Charlie.  Drinking out of cups.  Yeah.  Great video on YouTube.  Doing very well.  Absolutely.  The story goes, what, the guy's tripping, he's in a closet or something, seeing all sorts of  shit, and his friends taped him.  And he's just going off with randomness.  Yeah.  What's your favorite line?  Oh, Dan doesn't want to play. 
[03:33:00]  Dan.  Do you want to play today?  Yeah.  I like playing.  What's your favorite line from drinking out of cups?  Well, I think it's just the who's this guy and then the anticipation to see who the  guy is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we get a taste of that before we play Charlie's remix with the Iron Sheik?  That might be the way to go.  Iron Sheik.  Did Charlie do good work on this?  I don't know.  We're going to go cold with this.  If Charlie did do good work on this, we will remember Charlie's name and who he is, and 
[03:33:30]  that's how...  What, does this guy think he's an Indian?  He's here, I'll kick you, Charlie.  What, is he a goddamn asshole?  What the fuck is he doing?  Not ever.  No way.  Now he's Johnny Hammersticks.  Hammering away like he's friggin' Tommy Noble.  What the hell is he doing?  Think she's...  Think she's got it going bossing over.  No way.  No way.  What is this garbage? 
[03:34:00]  What is this?  Oh, I'm king of the trees.  I'm the tree meister.  I count on them.  Well, sometimes I pry, I like to stealst.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  This guy's a faggot.  This guy's some sort of faggot Indian in the teepee.  Oh, this guy thinks he's Captain Knots.  Thinks he's Captain Ty and Knots.  When everyone needs some Knots tied, they go to him.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  This woman's such a bitch. 
[03:34:30]  Thinks she's Miss Sand.  Drinking out of cups.  Drinking out of cups.  Being a bitch.  I bet her fist.  I bet her feralisk.  Barned.  Patterskum.  Pattered a little kid in the background.  Fucking going crazy.  Who's this guy?  Mr. Balloons.  Mr. Balloon Hands.  No way.  No way.  Get real.  No way.  Like those things. 
[03:35:00]  Mr. Walkway.  Mr. Walk down me.  I'm the walkway.  Lead me to the building.  Fuck you.  What were you saying?  Five, six, four, three.  Yeah, right.  You're some stupid bitch.  Who paid for that floor?  Not me.  No way.  Never be able to no floor ever again.  Not once.  Not never.  Nope.  Whose chair's that?  Who bought that goddamn chair here?  That's not my chair.  Not my chair.  Not my problem.  That's what I say.  No way.  Stupid dresses. 
[03:35:30]  Stupid flowers.  Lighthouses rule.  If you don't like a lighthouse, you suck.  What is this?  Seahorse captain?  What is this?  Seahorse seashell party?  Who didn't invite me?  Why didn't I get invited?  Seahorse sea hell?  What is this?  Get real.  I'm in love with seahorses.  I'm in love with them.  They're so beautiful and cute.  I'm in love with the seahorses.  They're fucking unreal.  I love them.  They're like all the clocks.  I love them.  I love seahorses.  And I love looking at them. 
[03:36:00]  And I love seashells.  I love seashell things.  I love things with seashells and seahorses on them.  Like blankets and towels and little bags.  I love them.  Seahorses.  Forever.  That's fucking good.  God damn it.  That is such a great rambling fucking rant.  It gets better and better too.  Two and a half million views.  Who is the guy?  Does anybody know?  Charlie knows.  Charlie.  Big day for Charlie, everyone.  What's up, Charlie?  Hi, Claudius.  No way. 
[03:36:30]  Who's the guy?  Dan Deacon is, um, he does electronic music.  No way.  He's very big in the, uh, hipster douchebag movement.  It's the walkway.  That was the guy?  Fuck you.  He actually doesn't sound like that at all.  When he tells us the walkway, fuck you.  Yeah, walk up.  Leave me up to the building.  Fuck you.  Leave me up to the building.  Fuck you.  He was on acid when that was done?  That's the story that's going around.  That's what I've been told.  I think they're trying to figure out if it's real or not.  It has to be.  Dude, I don't know who could write, you can't write something like that. 
[03:37:00]  That's hysterical.  You'd have to just go random.  Yeah.  You know people are probably trying to duplicate it, but just suck it.  I know.  Can't do it.  Going for jokes.  Right.  Those ladies look like the golden girl.  Shut up.  Should we have E-Rock try one?  I would love to have E-Rock.  Just have him talk.  Yeah.  Ask him a coherent question.  Dunce.  We should put him in an actual closet really dark and just make him do one of those.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Just whatever you want.  That's a great idea.  Dude, that would be a great idea.  It's got to be random and awful and non-connecting. 
[03:37:30]  Mr. Mayonnaise.  Yeah.  Mr. Bacon.  Everything's food.  Yeah.  Ooh, the pickle twins.  Here they come.  Am I not going to eat it?  No way.  I'm eating it.  No way.  No how.  Seal out of my stomach, Mr. Hero Sammage.  Lighthouses.  I'm going to Red Lobster.  Charlie, what's this thing you put together?  Give us a little synopsis.  It is.  Quicker.  It's the Iron Sheik and Dan Deacon arguing and interacting. 
[03:38:00]  You told me to tell you, look, Jimmy, look now.  We'll make believe we're still doing radio.  Yeah, it was like.  It was like, I'm looking at the TV.  Holy shit.  Whoa.  Wow, wait.  What is that about?  It smells like lamb underneath it.  Did she have a nervous breakdown?  I don't know.  There's a girl walking around.  What can we say if we're on our show?  Big lamb tits.  Huge tits.  They hung some lamb.  You can't address them with anything.  What? 
[03:38:30]  You can't address them.  On the radio?  No.  Don't even say that?  No, no, no.  I mean, specifically.  No.  You can't say, hey, that girl, blah, blah, blah.  No bra, lots of cleavage, big.  Big tits.  Big tits.  Big tits.  And everyone in this place has noticed, but of course, we all, because we're in a corporate  environment, got to make believe it's not happening.  Oh, it didn't happen.  Maybe she's just looking for one person.  God, it must be so easy to be abroad at work.  She keeps walking by Shade 45.  Oh, uh-oh. 
[03:39:00]  If you were abroad at work and you had nice, like, like tits, wouldn't you just, like,  go to work, no bra, pretty much have them hanging out and wait for that one guy to be  an idiot and pinch your hiney and then run to Human Resources and get a payday?  Bait them.  That's what I would fucking do.  Shum the waters.  Who needs to work when you can do something like that nowadays?  Charlie, the Iron Sheik vs. Drinking Out of Cups, made by you.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  What is this? 
[03:39:30]  Who's this guy?  How's he doing?  Oh, big sir.  What is this garbage?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What is this guy?  I think he's an Indian.  Good question.  Yeah, right.  This guy's a faggot.  Half on half.  Half men, half gay.  This guy's some sort of faggot Indian.  Who the fuck?  You're fucking a stinky ass.  Let him.  Yeah, right.  You're some stupid bitch.  Suck my tennis cock.  No way.  Suck my tennis cock.  Not ever.  And put you in the camel crash.  Bullshit.  Break your back. 
[03:40:00]  Bullshit.  And fuck your ass.  This guy's a faggot.  Makes you humble.  Get real.  Go fuck yourself.  Fuck you.  My cock is too good.  Too good as a stinky fat ass.  Some sort of faggot Indian.  Keep your fucking mouth shut.  Lighthouses rule.  Oh, man.  You're still a part fuck.  You don't like the lighthouse?  You suck.  Oh, man.  Tell him.  Oh, I'm king of the trees.  I'm the tree meister.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You know what?  Not bad, Charlie.  Not bad.  I like the audio consistency and audio quality was very good, too. 
[03:40:30]  What did you do?  One off a computer and one off your parents' black and white TV in the next room?  He's just an intern.  He doesn't have the tools of the trade.  He's learning the skills.  Yeah, he's learning the skills.  Good job.  Intern Matt put Iron Sheik versus Hitler and Iron Sheik versus Brooke Hogan together.  Sam, what are these about?  Charlie, very good.  I liked it.  Thank you.  Sam.  Now you get the hell out of here. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, exactly.  The interns that have been here more than one semester are at war with each other because  they were told to be more productive.  Ah, good.  Why more productive?  How about just be productive?  Yes.  More.  Do something.  Matt, you were playing the fat Little Nicky yesterday, right?  And you heard us talking about you?  Yeah, I did.  I'm sorry.  It's all right.  I saw that he got bummed out.  Nah, it's all right.  You were playing a really good Little Nicky for us and everything.  And then we had to, like, go after your obvious fault.  Eh, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  All right.  What did you get? 
[03:41:30]  Which one is that?  Intern Matt, Iron Sheik versus Hitler, or Brooke Hogan?  I don't like your wispy Mr. Echo beard.  It's really fucking bothering me.  Mr. Echo.  You're growing that hair back, right?  Yeah.  You said fuck that with the short hair.  I've given up on life, so I'm just going to try to look as homeless as possible.  Why are you giving up on life?  Eh.  Eh, things ain't panning out.  Nah.  What are you going to do?  So what are you going to do?  Like, drugs and shit?  Nah.  Live under a bridge?  Nah.  No way, no how.  No way, no how.  I'm just going to try to make it in this business, which is basically giving up on life. 
[03:42:00]  I'm the bridge man.  No way.  No way.  Look at Mr. Balloon Hands.  Drinking the cups.  Miss Sand.  Miss Sand.  Drinking the cups.  Huh?  You're right.  You're right.  So, uh.  Bullshit.  The best is leading me to the building.  Fuck you.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Just the walkway.  Mr. Walkway's just trying to help you out.  Yeah, fuck you.  Leading me to the building.  Fuck you.  Oh boy. 
[03:42:30]  Hitler speech stuff.  Oof.  What's wrong with Hitler speech?  Exactly.  Who's been fucking with Anthony's iPod?  Who knows what he's even saying?  Remember the Robert Clary incidents?  Yeah, but this isn't, uh, you know, playing it like...  Oh, right.  We don't want to live, we don't want to spend.  Oh, man.  Tell him.  We have the best allowed ever to come to this people and give them to the people.  Exactly.
