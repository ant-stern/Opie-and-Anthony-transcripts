<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a Tuesday lineup of recurring segments: Rock Scream Tuesday, Hummer Tuesday (involving female listeners performing tasks for their partners), Faraway Phone Call Tuesday, Wake Up Your Spouse Tuesday, and Makeup Stuff Tuesday (spreading false information).  The show’s theme was 80s New Wave music. Studio guests included Lowell Jimmy Norton and Club Soda Kenny, praised for retrieving Anthony's lost iPhone from Atlantic City.  A highly enthusiastic Australian caller, Nick, recounted a horse carriage accident in Central Park, prompting a discussion on animal welfare.  D.L. Hughley was announced as an upcoming guest.  The hosts discussed radio broadcasting restrictions, particularly regarding website mentions and controversial content; a lack of listener creativity in some segments; news stories such as the Britney Spears/Kevin Federline drama and a leaked O.J. Simpson audio tape; and a story about a ten-year-old Red Sox fan receiving a “Red Sox Suck” autograph from a Yankees player, sparking a debate on athlete role models and societal oversensitivity.  The hosts also criticized censorship in television and radio, using examples from the Emmys and a Nickelback song, frequently employing vulgar language and discussing controversial subjects.

The show continued with Opie and Anthony expressing frustration with censorship in mainstream media, contrasting it with the uncensored content available online.  They discussed examples of censorship, including avoiding profanity (the "F-word," "N-word"), Asian accents, and even sports-related insults on t-shirts.  They also discussed the O.J. Simpson case and Larry King's interview, mocking King's perceived senility; the low Emmys ratings and Ray Romano's possible use of the "F-word"; the Isaiah Thomas case and speculation about the meaning of the "B-word" used in the news; the "Beaners" Coffee Shop name change; Michael Vick's punishment compared to other crimes; and Larry Craig's arrest, all treated with crude humor.  They also touched on societal issues like high incarceration rates in Southern California, single motherhood, and the hypocrisy of censoring violent music while readily selling guns.  D.L. Hughley, promoting his HBO special "Unapologetic," was a guest and discussed the show's controversial nature and celebrities who refused to appear.

A significant portion then focused on a debate regarding the perceived disparity in punishment between Bill Belichick (fined for cheating) and Michael Vick (suspended for dogfighting), expanding to include Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire. Racial aspects of the punishments were also discussed.  This segment included listener-created techno remixes and a news story about a fight in a spin class. Hughley, promoting his HBO special, participated before briefly leaving the studio.  The show continued with the "80s New Wave Tuesday" music, a Miss PalTalk contest promotion (with the prize increasing from $500 to $1,000),  listener-submitted material for a Van Halen parody, and snippets of a purported Van Halen rehearsal.  Profane language and sexually explicit topics remained prevalent throughout.


The next segment featured D.L. Hughley, discussing contrasting musical tastes. Hughley's unfamiliarity with Van Halen and Led Zeppelin contrasted with the hosts' surprise at his lack of knowledge of certain artists, leading to a discussion of a Led Zeppelin ripoff band referred to as "the OJs".  The conversation shifted to Hughley's upbringing in Los Angeles, his limited exposure to white people and different musical genres, and racial dynamics in different parts of the city. They discussed Van Halen's status in black and white culture.  Humorous and vulgar discussions included the Catholic Church's sex abuse settlements, religious artifacts like crying statues, Mormon beliefs about Black people before 1978, Don Imus' statements, the attractiveness of female basketball players, and the use of the "N-word" in comedy, referencing Richard Pryor and Dave Chappelle, along with over-the-top reactions to controversial statements. A caller, Jim, challenged Hughley's statistics on Iraq War amputees, resulting in a heated exchange about Hughley's appearance on Bill Maher and the Imus controversy. The discussion concluded with the increased accessibility of visual content, particularly war and plane crash footage, and further discussion of the Iraq War and the caller's perceived hypocrisy, with highly profane and offensive language used throughout.

Finally, the segment with D.L. Hughley continued, focused on musical tastes and preferences between Black and white audiences, often veering into vulgar tangents on race, sex, and personal experiences.  They debated song popularity among different demographics, joking about stereotypes and personal experiences.  They played and discussed songs by The O'Jays and Looking Glass, initially misidentifying a Looking Glass song as being by a Black artist.  The conversation included anecdotes about Hughley's father, a childhood blowjob, and his wife's attempt to collect his semen for IVF.  The broadcast ended abruptly due to a power outage, with the hosts scrambling to recover missing audio from listeners via Paltalk.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talkshow radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I want to be called the A-Man.  Like you're the I-Man? I want to be the A-Man.  How about I call you the A-H-Man?  Don't get started again now.  Opie and Anthony.  In the middle of the night, I got an email from Eric that I read this morning when I got up.  that he's very, very depressed  because his refrigerator door fell off. 
[00:01:00]  It made a break for him.  Obi and Anthony.  Stupid Australians  whose national hero got killed  by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wakey, wakey. 
[00:01:30]  Wakey, wakey.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Wake up.  Wake up.  It's Obi and Anthony.  We'll start off soft for everybody today.  Yeah.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  And how are you today?  Come on, wake up.  Wakey, wakey.  Wake up.  Wake up. 
[00:02:00]  Give a little shake.  Give a little nudge.  Wake up.  I said wake up.  Just rip the covers off.  Wake up.  It's the Obi and Anthony show  with Lowell Jimmy Norton.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number 877-212-ONA.  Good morning to everybody on PalTalk.  Good morning.  They're making their way into the PalTalk room.  The Opie and Anthony PalTalk room.  Yes.  We got cameras in studio. 
[00:02:30]  They got cameras at home.  We watch our listeners listen to the radio show.  A little weird.  They watch us doing it.  Oh, there's EROC's camera.  Let me get that.  How about I put this down?  There we go.  All right.  Now we're cooking.  Good morning to the early instant feedbackers.  There's a link on one of our websites.  I don't even know if we're allowed to mention websites.  Who knows?  I don't know. 
[00:03:00]  I really don't know if we're allowed to.  Who knows anymore?  That used to be very important to us.  We like to have an interaction with the listeners.  And it was our thing to mention the website a million times every day.  Yeah.  Mention the website.  If we film something in studio, we would go,  Wow, you know that cool thing you just saw on the radio?  Well, later tonight, if you go to our website, which is blah, blah, blah, blah,  you get to see that video.  Now, who knows?  But because we might be linked to nudity three or four clicks away,  we can't mention the website, I guess. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  The rules change every day, so I don't know.  Yeah, you could plug strip club sites as long as they're forking over some cash.  It just doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  It's stupid.  Well, I'll tell you this much.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Thank God.  We got themes every day.  Yeah.  I'm noticing that we have too many themes for Tuesday.  Tuesday?  Why is Tuesday the big day?  I don't know.  It chases all the time. 
[00:04:00]  There's got to be some science behind that.  We might have to trade one of these themes to another day.  Oh.  Or we could get rid of one of these themes.  Let me see.  Today is Rock Scream Tuesday.  I'll tell you which one I'll get rid of right off the bat.  No.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  It's also Hummer Tuesday, which is another great bit we used to do back in the day.  And we tried to bring it back, and the lawyer said, you really can't describe Hummer Tuesday.  You could say it.  Just don't talk about it.  You know, because it might be edgy. 
[00:04:30]  Anything edgy just doesn't work in radio anymore.  No.  So it is Hummer Tuesday.  We would love to tell you what Hummer Tuesday is all about, but the lawyers will freak out.  So just figure it out yourself.  What can we tell you?  But basically, we pull the female listeners into our lair.  We get them really into the radio show, and then we have them do something for you, the husband or the boyfriend.  That's it.  And they're supposed to say, ah, this is for being a fan of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:05:00]  And you go like, thanks.  Thank you.  Now go make me a sandwich.  So it's Hummer Tuesday.  That's about all we could do with Hummer Tuesday these days.  We used to have parody songs.  We used to have girls call up.  We used to have girls call up actually doing it, but we wouldn't describe that, so we kept it FCC friendly, and then other things would happen.  But now we could kind of talk around the fact that it's Hummer Tuesday.  Thanks for the help.  Thanks for the help, lawyers.  Thank you so much. 
[00:05:30]  You make this very easy to do every day.  Of course.  Also, it's far away phone call Tuesday.  See, this is where I start thinking, well, maybe that one can go.  Why?  Because it never works out well.  It does.  People are rarely far away.  We've had calls from Korea.  Yeah.  The good side of Korea.  Of course.  I guess that would be South Korea.  Yes.  Yes.  We've had calls from where else? 
[00:06:00]  Where else?  Hawaii.  Japan.  Japan.  Australia.  New Zealand.  New Zealand, yes.  Yes, New Zealand.  Antarctica.  You know what?  We might have to drop this bid.  I mean, you get a call from Antarctica.  Who's topping that?  Unless someone on the space shuttle or the space station wants to give us a call.  That was that guy that's working at one of those scientific places in Antarctica.  Where it's already 20 below zero.  Yeah.  In the middle of summer or whatever the hell.  Can't go outside.  Yeah.  No, it was warm today.  We only had to wear two parkas. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, he called up.  So, we got a far away phone call Tuesday, excuse me.  Yeah.  We also have wake up your spouse Tuesday.  Wake up your spouse.  That's, you know, spouse, girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever.  Whatever you're laying in bed with.  You're up.  They're asleep.  Wake them up in a very obnoxious fashion.  Stick a pot over their head and hit it with a wooden spoon.  I don't care what you do.  Yeah, the listeners haven't been creative with that one. 
[00:07:00]  No.  We want marching bands.  They go in and go, all right, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to wake up.  And we're like all psyched.  Okay, go do it.  And they go, wake up.  Wake up.  Yeah.  Because that's how you wake someone up.  No, we want one of those big, you know, marching drums.  Yeah.  Where you walk in.  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  Cymbals.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or pots and pans, like I said.  Something ridiculously loud and obnoxious. 
[00:07:30]  Hopefully, yeah, hopefully somebody will wake up their spouse in a fine way today.  It's also Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  And this is the brilliance of Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  If you're listening right now, you're going to be in on the bit.  You're in on it.  Because how radio works, I mean, we got the hardcore, you know, fans.  They have to listen every single minute.  And then they'll hear the bad segment and then say how much we suck.  Right.  But then other people will only listen for 15, 20 minutes a day. 
[00:08:00]  And they just so happen to hear the best bit of the day.  Yeah.  And they think we're just brilliant.  We rule.  Then we rule.  Right.  We like the people that think we're brilliant, by the way.  Not the people that have to listen to every single moment and then nitpick.  You know, they were really good until 7.35.  From 7.35 to 7.42, they were calling it in.  Stop your nitpicking.  Right. 
[00:08:30]  So it's Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  So we should come up with something good in the next, like, I don't know, half hour.  And then we just play it as, like, a fact for the rest of the day.  And then the new listeners coming in later on this morning will believe it as true.  Yeah.  And then they're the dummies that go to work and spread the rumor for us, and then if you  were listening early, you start laughing at them.  Yeah.  That's it.  It's easy.  You just make something up.  You've got to make it sound, you know, kind of reasonable.  Right.  But completely far-fetched.  And we don't mind if the listeners get involved with that. 
[00:09:00]  We might do it ourselves today with maybe an OJ fact that's not true.  Because that one, anyone will believe anything.  So maybe we...  They'll say, oh, my God, Jack Ruby stepped up to OJ as they were leading him in and shot  him in the stomach.  Yeah.  And people might believe it, because the OJ thing just gets sillier.  Yeah.  Sillier by the day.  All right.  So maybe we'll just come up with a good OJ fact that's not true for Makeup Stuff Tuesday,  okay?  A factoid.  By the way, Anthony in Vegas, Opie, please tell Angela it's Hummer Tuesday. 
[00:09:30]  Angela, it's Hummer Tuesday.  Oh.  That's it.  And then finally, Anthony, the big get for today.  Yes.  We just came up with this last week, and we might have to trade one of these themes out,  because this one isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  It's 80's New Wave Tuesday.  80's New Wave Tuesday.  It's 80's New Wave Tuesday.  Come on, mug like a dog for me.  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want to make me cry? 
[00:10:00]  I am serious.  And don't call me Shirley.  Our house, in the middle of our street.  Our house, in the middle of our street.  Don't you want me, baby?  Don't you want me?  Oh.  It's 80's New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  That sounded like the best of Down Syndrome Records.  From Down Syndrome Records, your favorite 80's songs. 
[00:10:30]  That's pretty good, though, man.  That is good.  That's Steve from down the hall.  That's Roland.  Yeah.  And, of course, Club Soda Kenny, who is so stupid.  Let me tell you how stupid Club Soda Kenny is.  Club Soda Kenny, after getting up at 4 in the morning yesterday, doing the radio show with us,  decided that he needed to drive to Atlantic City to get Anthony's iPhone that he lost while gambling on Saturday night. 
[00:11:00]  Or Friday night.  That's above and beyond the call.  I believe FedExing it or something like that would have been appropriate or would have been good enough.  But Kenny had said, you'll have your phone tomorrow.  And he drove to Atlantic City and got it and brought it back.  Well, thank you, Kenny.  I would go to the ends of the earth for you. 
[00:11:30]  Technically, Atlantic City is the end of the earth.  It's, you know, the ocean is right there.  Right.  So you kind of did.  So I appreciate that.  Well, I didn't want you to be without your iPhone.  I know how much it means to you.  It means a lot to me.  You should have seen their look on their face when I asked for your 30 grand back also.  Yeah.  I don't think they gave that back.  No, I said, please. 
[00:12:00]  Did they give you any of it?  No.  No.  I'm going to have to go back and take it.  Yeah.  That's it.  But now I don't have, thank God, I don't have the stupid clip that came with this case.  I like the case, hate the clip.  Well, that was the reason why you lost the iPhone, most likely.  Because the stupid clip is stupid.  Yeah.  If I may say so.  It means he's got a nice case.  Maybe you want to see his.  A lot of people have been admiring my case.  Yours looks like it's in bondage.  It is.  Have you dropped yours? 
[00:12:30]  Not really, but the way I carry it is it's inside my pocket.  It looks like a pocket protector that you carry pens in.  So I actually put the phone in the pocket.  So the only thing hanging out is the clip.  The reason I got the clip is so I don't have to put the phone in the pocket.  Okay.  Well, we all both saw how that worked out.  Yeah, it worked out well.  You kind of look nerdy when it's on your hip, though, bro.  I don't care about it looking nerdy.  You look a little nerdy.  No, people would go, is that the iPhone?  That's a little nerdy.  Well, is that the iPhone?  It's a little nerdy.  They would ask me.  I'm glad you got rid of the clip. 
[00:13:00]  Now just throw it in your front pocket like every other man out there.  I can't.  My pants are too tight.  Nothing should be hanging outside your pants when you're walking around.  It's 2007.  This is technology.  It's got to be hanging off of you.  It kind of looks like this stupid Bluetooth.  You're not going to criticize Jimmy for having a Borg assimilation unit in his ear.  That looks cool.  Yeah.  It looks cool.  Yeah.  That blue light blinking in someone's ear is cool.  Your thing makes it look like you're carrying a beeper. 
[00:13:30]  Like you're going old school.  A beeper?  Yeah, because that's how you used to carry beepers back in the day.  A beeper does not have a touch screen.  People would carry beepers outside their pants to look cool.  Like, look what I got.  I got the latest technology.  Maybe a 1980s beeper.  I can now beep someone to make them call me.  Now they have to call a number.  Yeah.  And I leave a message.  Before the beepers actually had numbers.  When they just beeped and you had to call a central station.  Yeah.  And they would give you the message.  How stupid was that technology? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, and you know they had cell phone technology back then.  Hey, here's.  Just keeping it from us.  So Kenny went three hours for you yesterday.  At least.  Hour and a half each way just to get your iPhone.  More than that.  I'm going to say Kenny did almost five hours.  I'm going to say that.  My goodness.  By two hours, two hours plus the time in the casino.  Yeah.  It was well worth my time spent to recover that iPhone.  Can you say.  Thank you, sir.  Brown nose.  He just does what he does. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  That's what he does.  It's all he does.  I live for you guys.  I was so upset that he was upset.  I was.  I was upset.  I had lost my phone.  I thought that was it.  I started backing up all my phone numbers.  So when I got a new phone, I'd be able to just pop them on.  And then I get the email.  Yeah.  From Kenny.  Everything's okay.  Everything's okay.  Your phone's going to be okay.  Say the words.  All right. 
[00:15:00]  Well, did you thank him officially?  Of course.  Thank you, Kenny.  Yes, he did.  That was, like I said, above and beyond the call of duty.  If I may use the word duty.  All right.  Now go fetch me something.  Oh, jeez.  Your turn, GH.  What do you need?  Go fetch me something.  Iron my shirt.  That hurt my feelings, by the way, when we all changed roles.  And you played me by saying, go fetch me something.  He was being gentle. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  You need coffee?  No, thank you.  You're the star of the new promo that Timmy made, though.  I can't help myself.  That was good.  That was good vocals.  Once again, it's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  80s New Wave Tuesday.  Also, a lot of people calling up for Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  We need a whole new audience.  We can't start making stuff up.  Yeah, you got to wait.  People join the program every 20 minutes, so we got to wait at least another 20 minutes. 
[00:16:00]  So right around 7 o'clock, we'll take your phone calls for making stuff up.  Yeah, there's kind of, see, I'm looking.  If we do it now, everyone's going to be like, oh, that's funny, but I know it's Makeup Stuff  Tuesday.  You got to wait until the people that aren't listening now start tuning in later.  Right.  That's how radio works.  But I'm looking at a couple of these, and it's pretty good.  Yeah, they could work, but I don't even want to go to them now.  Like, wait another half hour, call us back, we're just going to take your call like it's  a regular phone call.  We're not even going to acknowledge it's Makeup Stuff Tuesday anymore today.  This is it.  That's how it works.  The people that listen early get to know that it's Makeup Stuff Tuesday. 
[00:16:30]  You guys help us out.  You call a little later, and we throw some things out there and see what sticks, okay?  Right.  All right.  Do you want to go with Faraway Phone Call Tuesday from Australia?  Well, it is Faraway Phone Call Tuesday.  Well, let's first go to Brian in Louisiana.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I've been driving a thousand miles tonight, and I've got to wake myself up with a rock screen.  All right.  Let's go. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  Very good.  Not much tremolo in it.  He did all right, though.  He's been up all night.  But he did all right.  Where are you driving to and why?  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  Really?  That's what I want to do.  He's gone.  Okay.  And finally, Faraway Phone Call Tuesday.  It's Nick in Australia.  Nick.  How you doing?  What time is it?  It is about quarter past eight, Tuesday night. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, those guys from Australia.  Yeah, I came over last year to see the show at Camden, and I did the walkover a little  bit.  You probably don't remember me.  You are a very fancy gentleman.  I do remember you.  You're like a blonde-haired guy, kind of short hair?  Look, we do this walkover.  We used to...  Hey, shut up.  We do this walkover.  We haven't done it in a long time.  Eventually, we'll get to doing that again.  And we've met probably thousands of people doing the walkover.  You're the only guy that sounded like you. 
[00:18:00]  So you kind of...  Oh, that's nice.  You kind of stood out, sir.  You probably don't remember me.  Like, we were talking to people that sounded like you every day.  Okay.  If you said, look, I was the guy from Staten Island, then we'd have a problem.  You came upstairs.  You hung out.  You actually...  Weren't you there twice, two days?  What's that?  Didn't you come by for two days, or was it just one?  No, I think three times I came up.  Okay, all right.  So, yeah, we're doing...  Yeah, this guy's hardcore, and he listens online. 
[00:18:30]  I remember you.  That's pretty cool.  So what are you doing tonight?  I'm coming back at Christmas.  Huh?  I'm coming back at Christmas.  I can't stay away.  Great.  We'll see you on that long flight.  With my girlfriend.  Yeah.  Oh.  We're going to take a horse ride through the park.  And watch him run into a tree and kill himself?  Jesus, what a story that was.  What horrified tourists.  Have to leave after their horse runs into a tree.  Probably some fat couple from Montana came to New York City. 
[00:19:00]  He's proposing, because there's a lot of proposals that go on while you're doing your horse carriage ride in the park.  And what happened?  The tree was...  I said the tree was spooked.  The tree got spooked and ran in front of the horse.  Yeah.  The horse was spooked or something?  Yeah, there was a guy doing a...  You know how people get in the park and they just start doing things for money?  Yeah.  Some street performer was playing a drum and he spooked a horse.  And that horse being spooked spooked another horse. 
[00:19:30]  And it's that horse that ran off and ran smack into a tree.  And killed itself?  It killed itself.  Yeah.  And then what happened to someone's beamer or something?  I heard like a...  Yeah, the other horse that got spooked, I think, ran into a BMW.  Right.  And kind of dented it up, but that horse and BMW are doing fine.  I'm weird with animals, man.  I'm not a hardcore animal rights activist by any means.  I'll eat my mead and I'll wear my fur and leather and all that crap. 
[00:20:00]  But I walk through the park a lot of...  By the way, not being an animal rights activist, you just talk about every cruel thing to it.  Look, I'm no animal rights activist.  It's really hysterical.  I'm no activist.  I'll beat one.  I'll kill one for fun.  You named every single thing.  I'll wear leather fur.  I eat meat.  I work at a chicken processing plant.  I take baseball bats to baby seals.  Baby seals, if it's in season.  Just want to hammer the point home that I'm not an animal rights activist.  Cut blubber out of whales. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  Use it for my own home heating.  I gargle with veal.  I mean, I'm no activist.  I keep warm with veal fat.  Oh, damn.  The veals don't get fat now, do they?  Oh, they get meaty.  They get meaty.  They get meaty.  Anyway, but when I see those horse and carriages around the park, I feel really, really, really  sorry for those freaking horses.  They're miserable.  Especially in the middle of the summer.  When it's a slow day, they just stand in the street as taxi cabs are missing. 
[00:21:00]  Shut up!  He's in Australia.  The time's different.  Yeah.  Do your role and just be a listener, please.  We'll talk a little bit later.  I want to go online with you later and just tell Qantas jokes.  Right.  Where's a stingray when you need one?  That's personal.  Anyway.  I agree with you.  I think they're cruel and I don't like them.  And my girlfriend and I are going to go on one over the summer or whatever it was, and  I wouldn't go on one in New York.  In Lancaster, we did it with this nice air. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  I hate that.  Not the city street and stuff.  There's nothing worse than seeing the poor horse sitting there when they don't have a  ride and they're parked all up and down.  What is that?  Central Park South.  Central Park South.  And they're sitting there.  And you ever see a horse sitting with his hip kind of like John Wayne?  He's got weight off of one leg and the weight's on the back leg.  And then he just goes and shifts his weight.  And just kind of hanging out here. 
[00:22:00]  This is just like it.  Supposed to be on the plains somewhere with me having sex with horses.  Right.  Oh, don't take that clip out.  Please don't isolate that clip.  If they even allow it through.  Are you allowed to say sex with horses?  Well, with horses, that's what they do out on the plains.  Right.  Anyway.  As long as you don't make fun of the horse's ethnicity or age.  Right.  And don't imitate what a horse sounds like.  No.  That would be really bad right now in this day and age. 
[00:22:30]  Horse Americans will be offended.  It's stereotyping.  The horse.  And don't call a horse the B word.  No.  We'll get into that as well.  And as the horses are waiting for their next ride, these cabbies and the black cars,  the black tinted ass wipes that drive those cars, are flying by the horses, missing them  by mere feet.  Oh, yeah.  All day long.  And the horse is miserable.  It doesn't get any air in this city.  They're sitting in traffic.  Like, they're sitting behind traffic with just exhaust pouring into their big horse nostrils. 
[00:23:00]  Those nostrils aren't made to have exhaust pipes in front of them.  And hard concrete under their little stupid horse feet.  I mean, look, again, I'm no horse activist.  Believe me, I'll beat one for glue in a second.  But they're standing on concrete with those hooves, which is painful.  I can't watch it.  I don't like it.  So Nick is bringing up a story that happened very recently, this horse running into a tree  and pretty much killing itself.  Oops.  Committing suicide because he doesn't want to give these dopes any more carriage rides 
[00:23:30]  through the park so some guy can go, will you marry me?  You sit there and then sometimes on a chilly night, they give you that disgusting blanket  that everybody else has been using.  Here, here's a blanket.  All right, Mr. Top Hat thinks it's $17.50 with his little riding crop.  As he's doing crystal meth in between rides.  Of course he is.  Behind a tree somewhere.  Hey, Nick, you got a kangaroo problem there?  What are you guys hitting in the streets all the time?  Of course we've got a kangaroo problem. 
[00:24:00]  I've got one as a pick.  We ride them to work.  I love it.  Australians, it's all about their kangaroos.  See, we think kangaroos are cute and adorable, whatever.  But over there, aren't they considered like rats?  Yeah, but they're only in the country.  The only thing you have to be worried about, they've got very strong paws and they can rip  your stomach open.  Yeah.  I hear they grab you and then kick you.  And what it was, so what gets hit in the street over there? 
[00:24:30]  Dingoes?  Possums?  Uh-huh.  Ooh.  Yeah, we've got little possums.  Never see that here.  Rabbits?  Dogs?  Cats?  I live in a city of three million.  I live in a city of three million.  I love this guy.  We probably.  He was funny.  It was funny when he just said, yeah, I have one as a pit.  We ride them to work.  Yeah.  Kangaroos.  That's so funny because everyone around the world, whoever they talk to from Australia 
[00:25:00]  is like, so kangaroos, huh?  Yeah, they're all over the place.  I live in a city of three million.  It's like here, you know, in the United States, there are cougars.  There are cougars.  But you really have to be out west.  Oregon.  In the right area.  Yeah, they do venture into people's yards every so often and tear apart a small child  or a dog or something.  But it's not like we have to worry about walking around and seeing a cougar.  Yeah, imagine you tell people what you're all about. 
[00:25:30]  You tell people, yeah, I'm from New York City.  Oh, yeah, you got any bears with you?  Yeah.  Well, sometimes one will wander in.  You ever seen a kangaroo just walking around?  No.  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  Nick, give us a call a little later this morning.  We like you.  I think you could be a regular on this radio show.  Here in New York, we hired some dude from, where the hell is that guy from? 
[00:26:00]  The first jock here on K-Rock.  He's from London.  Yeah, they hired some dude from London.  I'm trying to get an intern.  Oh, shut up!  They don't like London.  Hold on.  The first jock from K-Rock.  Yeah, the first jock from K-Rock is from London with that crazy accent.  So you're trying to get what, man?  An internship where?  At your show.  Oh.  That's going to be a long commute, man.  Yeah, that's a couple hours.  Yeah.  He'll do one hour at least.  A bit more.  I want to stand up, so I want to live in New York City for that. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, you're a comic?  Yeah.  I've done it for about a year and a half.  Oh, cool, man.  Jimmy will help you out.  All right, Nick.  We've got to let you go, all right?  Talk to you soon, man.  No worries.  All right.  See you later.  Thanks.  There goes Nick from Australia.  He's far away.  Phone call Tuesday.  There you have it.  And, of course, it's 80s New Wave Tuesday as well, so for Nick, we've got a little taste.  Oh.  A little taste.  Oh, yeah.  I want to play along with this. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I'm playing along with it.  I like this.  Hey, that's pretty good, man.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  Come on, my brother.  Do you really want to hurt me? 
[00:27:30]  Do you really want to make me cry?  I am serious.  And don't call me Shirley.  A house in the middle of our street.  A house in the middle of our street.  Don't you want me, baby?  Don't you want me, baby?  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:28:00]  And we'll be back in a few minutes.  I like it.  Oh.  Who doesn't?  It works on some level there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  You're waking up dogs all over America. 
[00:28:30]  I went a little high.  Yeah.  I haven't practiced on my whistle.  I'm a master of the pan flute.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  Yes.  One of the many things we're doing today.  877-212-ONA.  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:00]  I'm rocking.  Phone number, yes.  877-212-ONA.  I'm going to say that again.  Stupid whistle.  Turn it off.  It's supposed to be a joke.  You play too much of this song, people are going to start believing that we've lost our  minds over here.  My God, man. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Hey, Van Halen getting back together.  This is a quickie because, you know, our listeners are sending in stuff all the time.  Yep.  And Jimmy's obsessed with Van Halen getting back together.  Well, it's huge.  And he's trying to picture what the new Van Halen songs are going to sound like.  Because you know they're going to run through their material.  And that's fine.  That's what everyone wants to see.  But then they're going to try to put out a new song.  At least.  Maybe even a new album.  But the new hit song.  And Jimmy has this thing plotted out to the point where I get douche chill, like, embarrassment, 
[00:30:00]  uncomfortable, because I could picture them doing it.  This guy, we have a, let's just say a listener did something very good.  It's not the way I envisioned it.  And I will have a version done the way I envisioned it.  Yes.  But the listeners can't get inside my head.  So what they did, I like a lot.  Yeah, he's taking Jimmy's lyrics and put some Van Halen-esque music to it.  Yeah, they're taking the work parts. 
[00:30:30]  Every once in a while, we'll talk about the Van Halen reunion and what the song should  sound like.  And Jimmy will give you some examples.  And, well, Pete from Morningside, he took all these little snippets of Jimmy on the show  and he came up with the Van Halen song.  It's quick.  It's about a minute.  It's a sample here.  The name of the song is We're Back.  And there's an exclamation point after it.  And in parentheses after We're Back, it says, And We're Better Than Ever.  And there's another exclamation point.  That's the name of the song.  The exclamation points annoy me, too. 
[00:31:00]  Well, that's the name of the song.  You know the name of the song.  As opposed to the B-side, which is, We're a little bit older, dot, dot, dot, but we ain't  much wiser.  That's the B-side song.  Well, this is what Pete from Morningside envisions Jimmy's Van Halen song should sound like.  All right.  We've been away for a long, long, long, long, long time. 
[00:31:30]  We've been through changes.  We've played some games.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.  We're a little bit older, but we ain't much behind us.  We're back.  We're better than ever.  We're back. 
[00:32:00]  We're back.  Together forever.  We're back.  We're back.  We're better than ever.  We're back.  We're back.  Together forever.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back. 
[00:32:30]  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  There you go.  Pete from Morningside.  And I want to make it perfectly clear, Jimmy didn't go into a studio and sing along here.  This is just work parts that Jimmy throws out there every once in a while.  And Pete put a little guitar to it.  He just grabbed the clips.  I hope no one's mistaking that for a work of professionalism.  Of course not.  Folks, we just have to clarify that's not Van Halen.  We're giving guitar players all over America some work now.  Because they're all trying to figure out what your song should sound like, Jimmy. 
[00:33:00]  It makes me sound like I just went in and just did the one, like I went right into the chorus.  Right, right.  There's a little bit of, I don't know.  Well, he didn't know.  Of course he didn't.  Yeah, he just took clips of you doing the show and decided to put some Van Halen type music.  Why, you want to add another clip that people could work with?  Because these songs are being made all over the place now.  Well, I did a couple yesterday.  All right.  It's hard.  I don't have full, again, I was going to write down full verses, but I did not.  But I will by tomorrow.  Yeah.  However, I did like the one version where they try to bring in some of their old stuff. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Like occasionally a band will bring in an old line, and the one line was like, now I'm  the teacher and the girl's hot for me.  We're back.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You know what I did?  Dirk Norton.  That's what Pat from Monaco is calling him.  Dirk Norton.  I know.  Come on.  It's going to be a hit.  We need it.  Come on.  Wow.  All right.  What are we talking about today? 
[00:34:00]  There's a lot going on.  Oh, D.L.  Hughley's going to be joining the show in about 15, 20 minutes.  Very cool.  He's got his HBO special coming out, right?  I heard it was.  I haven't seen the promos for it.  I heard the promos were funny, too.  I have not seen them.  Yeah.  So I just added nothing to that.  And here's some of your headlines.  Eagles lost last night.  Britney Spears might be losing her kids.  A bodyguard that worked for her for like a month and a half, two months is like a surprise  witness.  Oh, yeah.  And basically saying that she liked to be naked around her kids and was doing drugs 
[00:34:30]  openly in front of her kids.  Wow.  So the bodyguard has a lot of crazy things to say about Britney Spears.  That's nice.  Rat.  And then also, a story came out yesterday that there was a hit on Kevin Federline.  A hit?  A hit.  That the FBI, I guess, was looking into.  And now it's the only hit he'll get.  Hold on, pop.  But it's a, they closed the case at this point.  But supposedly, he was a little worried about his life.  Was he a fan? 
[00:35:00]  An obsessed male fan?  Maybe.  I think he's pretty much hinting Britney had something to do with it.  Oh, putting out a hit on him, maybe?  So she could have the kids?  Yeah.  D.L.  Hughley will be in at 730.  His plane just landed.  Okay.  That's fine.  Also, what do we know on OJ?  What's the latest on the OJ?  Well, there's that tape that everybody, it's now all the rage.  It ended up on TMZ, which, by the way, is just scooping everybody with everything these days. 
[00:35:30]  But the problem is, this guy that kind of goaded OJ, they're claiming, goaded OJ into getting some golfing buddies to grab some pistols and get his stuff back.  He brought the tape recorder and tape recorded this whole thing and then sold it to TMZ, which kind of ruins the credibility of the whole thing. 
[00:36:00]  But it is indeed OJ on the tape and his thugs getting this memorabilia back from this guy in the hotel room.  You get to hear the real OJ.  That is OJ.  That's not that smiling OJ.  We never saw that angry OJ during the murder trial or anything or beforehand.  The closest we got.  Beforehand or afterwards.  The closest we got was when they cuffed him the first time. 
[00:36:30]  It was a telephoto shot.  And OJ kind of turned his head and he was scowling.  And he was a face you never saw on OJ.  And people kind of looked like, wow, that OJ looks angry.  I've never seen that before.  But you didn't hear from him being angry.  It was always, no, no, no, let me tell you, everything's fine.  But this time, wow.  Emmer, effer.  So the guy pretty much set up OJ.  Hinted that he should come and get his stuff back. 
[00:37:00]  That's kind of what people are saying now.  But this might be rumors being spread to get a defense going.  And regardless, if he goaded OJ into doing this, it was done.  You know, you could tell somebody, hey, go rob a bank.  You could tell the guy, no.  Or you could go in and rob the bank.  You're still committing a crime.  I didn't feel like he did anything wrong on this one.  I mean, I heard the tape, he was just going to get his stuff back, which was his from some scummy dealer. 
[00:37:30]  I just, I don't have any problem with a guy going to get, that's the way it should be handled.  If a guy steals your stuff.  Well, it should be.  But all the sports memorabilia, people out there saying, what is he doing?  That stuff was crap.  Yeah.  It really wasn't worth much.  Three to five hundred dollars.  I mean, why would you risk so much to get stuff that's really worth not that much?  Because OJ's probably broke.  In the long term.  I bet OJ's broke.  He's used to living a more lavish lifestyle than his pension from football can afford him.  And he rounded up his golfing buddies.  Some golfing buddies. 
[00:38:00]  And get your guns.  We're going to do this.  Get your guns.  I've got to get my memorabilia back.  Right.  And then Fred Goldman has, he's, he popped out and said that he wants all of OJ's memorabilia.  All the memorabilia.  Like, he's just.  I love Fred Goldman.  Fred Goldman wants anything OJ has.  Yeah.  The shirt off his back.  Yeah.  He just does not want him to have anything.  Which is fine.  I mean, the guy killed his son. 
[00:38:30]  For the love of God.  It's hard to get, like, the killers to show, like, their real face.  Yeah.  John Douglas, who was an FBI profiler, had a great, like, Wayne Williams was the Atlanta  child killer.  And he's such a meek guy that it was really hard to picture him doing that.  So what he, I think, suggested to the prosecution was to invade his space while he was on the  stand and get close to him.  And he did that during the trial.  And he somehow goaded Wayne Williams into becoming really angry on the stand.  That's like a movie moment. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Where they do that.  It worked.  And the jury got to see, like, that's the meek guy we've been looking at this whole trial.  Like, he tricked Wayne into saying something, tying him into killing children.  Wow.  And, yeah, like, he screamed at him.  It got really ugly.  And sometimes you got to know how to operate with these guys to get their truth to come out.  Yeah.  Because you always see that in the movies.  The prosecutor starts questioning the defendant.  And the defendant's done a great job of covering up the whole time.  And then they say that one thing.  Yes!  And I'll kill you! 
[00:39:30]  I rest my case, your honor.  Right.  That's a hack.  It's such a hacky thing.  And telling you that, believe me, I did think of, like, you know, a few good men and every  other court routine, but this was from John Douglas' book, so I do believe it.  And what's going to happen?  I mean, life was kind of getting boring.  We needed an OJ story.  We need OJ.  So this is going to be around for a while.  Everyone's been waiting for something exciting that we could all follow as a nation.  From OJ. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  We need something to bring us together.  And a great little story coming out of Boston today.  Ten-year-old Red Sox fan.  You hear about this?  Oh, God.  This is just fantastic.  This poor little kid.  He's adorable.  He really is.  He's just dressed up in his little Red Sox garb.  Yeah.  Do we have the audio of this kid?  It's pretty funny.  Did we capture that?  Maybe we'll have it a little later.  A ten-year-old Red Sox fan asked the Yankees rookie, Shelly Duncan, for an autograph.  You know, the Yankees are up there playing, and the kid goes to his first game, and it 
[00:40:30]  was his lucky day.  He sees a Yankee, and he's like, oh, my God, I need an autograph.  So he asked Shelly Duncan for an autograph.  And Duncan signs, was it a baseball?  Oh, no, his little autograph book.  Yeah, it was just an autograph book.  He signs, Red Sox suck.  Red Sox suck.  And then writes Shelly Duncan.  And I got to tell you, I know we're on in Boston.  The Red Sox fans have got to appreciate that on some level.  On some level, you've got to appreciate that.  I think it's because he's such a young kid.  He's, what, ten years old or something? 
[00:41:00]  So if you're in your 20s or teens, even, and someone asks you for an autograph like  that to write Red Sox suck, yeah, who cares?  You laugh it off.  Who cares if it's a 10-year-old kid?  But the kid is probably like, again, the kid probably didn't care.  The parents probably saw and went, oh, that's so inappropriate.  Well, they paraded him on TV yesterday, and he was using things like, he's a role model.  He shouldn't be doing these things.  Ah, see, they fed him all that.  They fed him all that.  Let the kids just decide on themselves, for themselves, certain things. 
[00:41:30]  What's really disturbing them?  Jeez.  At 10 years old, I think you could realize if Red Sox suck is just a funny joke, or if  your parents are going to pound it in your head that there's a problem.  Yeah.  I think that's very funny that he wrote that joke.  It is funny.  When I was a kid, my dad took me to a Yankee game to see the Oakland A's, I think, and  one of my most vivid memories is being in the subway here in New York, and everyone wearing  Boston Sucks shirts.  They weren't playing the Red Sox. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  The Red Sox had nothing to do with it, and yet there was a Boston Sucks.  It's just, it's a fun rivalry.  Yeah.  So, well, do they realize now that the autograph is worth a lot more?  Oh, yeah.  Now it's a famous autograph.  It's in the paper.  I'm looking at a picture of the kid and his Red Sox stuff.  He's got the hat and a little jersey on, and he's holding up the Red Sox Sucks autograph.  Shouldn't it be Sucks?  Red Sox Suck.  Red Sox. 
[00:42:30]  No, Red Sox Suck is correct.  Yeah, okay.  Red Sox Suck.  Shelly Duncan.  And he's got a serious look on his face, like, this is so wrong.  I'm just a kid.  Oh, stop already.  And Duncan's Avenue, Duncan's Avenue, I'm sorry, that's where my grandmother was from.  Duncan's explanation is, look, I thought I was back in middle school or high school,  where you try to make a joke or say something funny, and you end up saying something that  gets you in trouble, Duncan said.  I try to be interactive, be funny, have a good time, and laugh.  That's it.  I mean, that's what he was doing.  There you go. 
[00:43:00]  Wait, he shouldn't have to explain himself.  Of course, I agree.  And then he had to say, look, I know I have a girl's name, but.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe he's a little angry because he's got a girl's name.  But he shouldn't have to explain why he wrote that.  And the mother's, of course, this is everything that's just a nation of sissies.  The mother says, this is someone who wears the Yankee uniform and is on the payroll and  should be setting an example for 10-year-olds.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Like who jolt and joke.  Stop looking.  Yeah.  Like Mickey Mantle, who drank until his liver fell out, he had to pick it up.  Or Pete Rose, who was gambling, or Joe DiMaggio, who was batting Maryland around. 
[00:43:30]  Or old steroid head.  Yeah, exactly.  Why don't you read a book on Ty Cobb?  Absolutely.  Wow.  The babe.  Stop looking at our athletes as role models.  They're not role models.  They don't want to be your role model.  They're playing a game.  They want to make millions of dollars and bang hot chicks.  Having a little fun with the kids.  And get away with cheating as much as possible.  They don't want to be your role model.  Stop putting them in that light. 
[00:44:00]  Having a little fun with the kid.  We're writing down Red Sox suck.  Who cares?  I guess if you wrote something awful or racist or, you know.  Yeah.  Or the language was sucks isn't a bad word.  Red Sox suck.  I mean, that's something they're saying in kindergarten.  Yeah.  Of course.  In the New York school system.  And the Yankee suck chant, you hear it all the time up there.  And kids are yelling it.  At funerals, you hear it in Boston.  Oh my God.  Anywhere. 
[00:44:30]  And let it be known, I don't like the Yankees.  And if a Red Sox player did it to a Yankee kid fan.  Yeah.  And said Yankee suck, I would be laughing and saying the same stuff today.  Yeah.  Wouldn't matter.  No problem.  Who cares?  No problem on that one.  If they wrote Mets suck.  I like the Mets.  I'd be laughing.  I would think it was hilarious that, you know, a Red Sox player wrote that for a 10-year-old kid.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  Just a fruity little nation.  Yeah.  We've gotten way past the point of no return now. 
[00:45:00]  It's pathetic.  It's pathetic what these...  And it's...  Parents, like, putting the priorities in the wrong place.  Just do your parenting, but don't worry so much about...  Growing up, and I hate to sound like that.  You know, when I was growing up...  But it didn't matter.  Your father would be like, you got an autograph.  Shut up.  Yeah.  I would have been psyched as a 10-year-old to get an autograph.  He should be a role model. 
[00:45:30]  That's the problem.  He's a role model, like old Billy Martin.  I'll throw your head through that windshield.  Role model.  I'll drive.  Old Joe Pepitone.  I've just come off the top of my head.  There's a million...  How about Dexter...  How about you...  There's Dexter Manley.  There's a million of them.  How about you do a little reading on a player named Cleon Jones and what he used to do in  a van with underage girls?  Did he?  I don't know.  Allegedly.  I don't know.  I'm just throwing accusations around now.  I'd better like...  Well, the girls were a bit on the young side. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know how young, though.  Raphael Septian from the Cowboys.  Luis Polonia, allegedly.  I heard he had some trouble.  Darryl Strawberry.  Doc Gooden should continue.  Keith Hernandez.  And these are just New York athletes.  We could pick any team.  They don't want to be your role models.  Just playing a stupid game.  They have some talent to play a game.  That's it.  So what is your job?  This ball?  I try to hit it and run before I'm tagged.  Oh, okay.  That's what I do.  Why should I know the ins and outs of child psychology and how they're supposed to be treated? 
[00:46:30]  All right.  It's like they dumped out of the Emmys.  Heard about that.  The Emmy Awards.  They were dumping out of Sally Field.  And they also dumped out of Ray Romano.  And on the news yesterday, the way they put it, I thought Ray Romano dropped the F-bomb.  Because his TV wife, his wife that was on the Ray Romano show there, is now in a new series with Kelsey Grammer.  Right.  So he got up on stage and said, well, now I guess Kelsey Grammer is beep-ing my wife. 
[00:47:00]  And every indication yesterday on every newscast I saw was effing.  That's what I thought they've dumped out of.  I was like, oh, well, that's a little racy for Ray to say on TV.  Don't tell me they dumped out of sleeping.  No.  A little better than sleeping.  A little more than sleeping, but not near effing. 
[00:47:30]  Vondling?  Nope.  No.  Is violating?  No.  It's a slang word for sex.  Oh.  Ass caving.  Whew.  Gave it a glance.  That's passable.  Banging.  No.  Starts with an S.  Slagging? 
[00:48:00]  No.  Stipping.  No, that's too ethnic.  Screwing.  Screwing.  Okay.  Dan held up a screwdriver and I almost said, no improv skills.  I cut my losses.  You were right there.  Damn it.  I cut my losses.  I realized I was out on a cliff with no parachute.  I slinked back into the tent.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's what they dumped out of.  So their big dumps yesterday were God Damn from Sally Field or whenever the hell the awards were Sunday. 
[00:48:30]  Anyway, and Screwing by Ray Romano.  That's it.  What network?  It was Fox.  Fox?  Blart?  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Hey guys, what's up?  How you doing, Mike?  This morning, I need to talk about the Red Sox.  Earlier this morning on Channel 5, they brought up the story. 
[00:49:00]  And at first they said the word sucks, but then they showed the kid in the autograph on TV,  and they actually blocked out the word sucks.  And every time after that, all the newscasters were actually afraid to say the word because they thought they were going to get in trouble.  Everyone's just petrified.  There is this air of just fear on every broadcaster, everybody, broadcaster, every citizen.  Man, you've got to watch what you say.  This is absolute lunacy that words like that, people are afraid to say it, put it out there, print it, put it on camera. 
[00:49:30]  Ugh.  Go ahead.  Keep trying to compete.  Exactly what you guys are talking with, the whole rivalry in Boston sucks and Yankees suck.  And when they're in Boston over the weekend, that's exactly what everybody was wearing, Yankees suck t-shirts.  It's part of it, dude.  It's part of it.  It's part of the great rivalry. 
[00:50:00]  I love the fact.  It's like a weird relationship with the Red Sox.  It's almost like.  It's great.  It's exciting.  It brings such an energy when those two teams are playing.  And I love the creativity with the shirts.  Whether it's a Yankee fan getting a good shirt or a Red Sox fan getting a good shirt.  I love it.  I love the whole thing.  Yep.  We deserve it, though.  As a country, we deserve it.  Aren't they banning some of those shirts from the.  Some of the ballparks.  Of course.  Let them wherever the hell they want to the game. 
[00:50:30]  We've tolerated it.  We've allowed guys to get fired for it.  So we deserve it.  It's like we're allowing the little fruits that we used to make fun of to dictate content.  Yeah.  And we deserve what we get as a country.  A bunch of.  Eventually soon, it seems like everything is going to be like those text message commercials  they have now.  Just all letters.  And that's it.  No words.  Just letters.  Not even the letters.  You can't even use the letters anymore.  No.  No.  We used to get around things by using letters, and now we can't even do that.  Yeah.  Americans suck.  All right, Mike.  Thanks for that.  All right.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:51:00]  You guys are wrong.  You guys are wrong.  They blurt out suck?  Of course.  Amazing.  I don't even know if that's true.  He could have been totally lying, and I'm such a dope.  But we'll just say it's true, because we're not news, so we don't care.  What?  We'll just blurt out inaccuracies.  Yeah, I just took a look.  When they first reported it about, you know, like 5.30, it was fine, and then they went  back to the story an hour later, and they had blurt out suck.  Oh, because that's when the children are getting up.  Yeah.  Or is it to make it more intriguing?  I'm wondering if they're doing that to make it seem more vile than it was. 
[00:51:30]  No, you know something?  I'd love to think that, and it might be part of it.  If they're not, some just whipped jackass was sitting there, an executive, and saw it  and went, you know, we're going to get complaints, or they got a complaint call.  Yeah, I, my children are waking up to the word suck on the TV news.  Blur it, blur it, blur it quick. 
[00:52:00]  You're raising a wimp.  Yep.  This whole country's just going to be a bunch of wussies.  Did they edit, this is my thing, did they really censor Sally Field, or was she going  over on time?  I thought the music was starting to play.  It was starting to play after she started getting into her little speech about the war.  No, she was just, when she's bumbling through it, what?  I don't know.  I don't think that music threw her.  I don't think they edited her because she was talking about the war.  I don't either.  I think they edited her because she was going way too long, and it was just one of those 
[00:52:30]  coincidences.  Dude, I think they edited her because of the war.  You do?  Yeah, absolutely.  Right when she started talking about the war, and not figuratively, because at first it  was almost figuratively talking about it, like she was being a little bit obscure about  it.  And then when she said the war, that's when the music kicks in.  And I think they tell these people now that if somebody starts their political speeches  at these events, they are to be cut off, especially something like Fox. 
[00:53:00]  It was on Fox?  Wasn't it on Fox?  I guess.  Yeah, that's what I'm writing for.  All right, we have to take a break.  We're going late here.  Really fast, I want to see if this is true, too.  On regular radio, the word drug is dumped in the new Nickelback song, Rockstar.  There you go.  Good, good.  There's no surprise there.  Do you realize we can't do impressions of ethnicities on this radio show?  No.  You can't.  They're just...  If I have a run-in on the street with an Asian gentleman and would like to describe 
[00:53:30]  it, I can't use the way he spoke.  And it's the way he spoke.  Like, I want to do an imitation of an Asian guy.  I can't do it anymore.  How ridiculous is that?  Completely ridiculous.  Because they say it's a stereotype or something, but it's not.  What if I went down to Chinatown and talked to a gentleman in one of the stores and I wanted  to come back and describe exactly what he said and how he said it?  I'm not doing a stereotype because I'm not saying this is how all Asians sound. 
[00:54:00]  I'm saying this is how, you know, Arthur Fong sounded down at the hanging upside down duck  shop in Chinatown.  But I can't do it.  Why?  It's not a stereotype.  I'm describing one guy I talked to.  One guy.  You can't do it.  It's amazing.  It is ridiculous.  We're doomed as a nation.  Doomed.  Well, radio's doomed.  I mean, there's so much competition right now.  So what do they do on regular radio? 
[00:54:30]  Crack down more.  They pull way back when there's so many other things that potential listeners could be doing  with their time, like, you know, being entertained by their cell phones, being entertained by  the Internet, iPods, everything.  So what does the regular radio do?  This is how stupid they are.  This is the time to push further to the edge.  Keep it FCC friendly, obviously, but you push all the way to the edge because there's  so much competition out there.  These dopey lawyers, you know, they run the broadcast stations and they're wrecking it 
[00:55:00]  for everybody.  They're petrified.  That's why when I go home, I get online and it's nothing but a break and YouTube.  I sit there and watch those videos and listen to audio of things that you would never hear  on television or radio.  Right.  Because it's damn entertaining.  It's funny.  It's provocative.  It's shocking.  It's everything that people want except for this small percentage of people that seem 
[00:55:30]  to be running things.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's why I'm not going to sit there and watch some some sappy, stupid network television  show when I could go online and watch actual footage from Iraq of, you know, there's a  new one where a roadside bomb goes off and just misses a couple of guys.  And then their exchange in the Humvee.  Whoa.  Oh, the whole earth rises up next to their Humvee. 
[00:56:00]  It's huge.  It looks like maybe they buried this thing a little too deep.  The terrorists or whatever they are, insurgents, whatever you want to call them this week.  And the guys in the Humvee just start going off like, woohoo, holy crap.  Yeah.  They're using real life language.  Oh, yeah, they are.  Yep.  Well, but no.  But Crystal Radio, they decided that we need to pull way back in this day and age.  Yeah.  Just a bunch of dopes.  Eventually, they'll come for you and you guys will be fired.  They don't care.  For being stupid.  Good luck. 
[00:56:30]  For being ridiculously stupid and ruining this whole thing.  There's so much competition right now.  You've got to push forward right to the edge because that's what the listeners are doing.  They're looking for edgy material on their iPods, on their cell phones, on the internet as they  watch all these videos like Anthony just described.  They're going to find it elsewhere.  That's why it's so popular.  That's why these sites are growing by leaps and bounds.  What we get is panicky peats.  Don't say the F word.  Don't say the N word.  Don't imitate an Asian. 
[00:57:00]  You're just stupid.  The whole lot of you are just stupid.  Don't imitate an Asian.  It sounds ridiculous just to say it.  But that's basically what has been said to us in the background.  Okay, fan.  Schoolyard stuff now.  Fans holding up the B word.  Break.  Really fast.  Some t-shirts around Fenway Park.  Jeter sucks.  A-Rod.  Jeter drinks wine coolers. 
[00:57:30]  Facade is a little bitch.  Right.  It's the B word now.  It's the B word.  Hopefully that got through.  And then Raul from Jersey.  Boston sucks.  Shirts banned from the Yankee Stadium bleacher seats.  That's stupid.  That's not cool either, man.  And there's a few other things, but I'll find them while we go to break.  It's like the edgier the internet gets and the more accessible that stuff comes, just the  bigger fruits they turn into on this end.  And it's not just radio, it's TV too. 
[00:58:00]  The shows, they're just so out of touch.  Yeah.  Somewhere along the line, like these big radio companies, you know, put a lot of faith in  these lawyers that probably don't even own an effing iPod or don't know what break.com  is or YouTube is, what your cell phone could do and what it is doing.  Because there's no direct way to compete, like to look at like the way, like the internet  is just kicking the crap out of these other things.  There's no like direct line. 
[00:58:30]  So they can't go.  Well, that's why.  So they blame all the artists.  Like, oh, it's all the jocks fault or it's all the on air personalities fault that people  aren't listening anymore because they don't look at the way it's swelling up on the  other side, which is what the net is doing.  You know, I think it's Fox.  Well, I'm not even sure, but something happened very recently, which I thought was brilliant.  TMZ, TMZ.com is a huge gossip, Hollywood gossip website.  And people have been going there for a few years now.  And the hits are just ridiculous on TMZ.com, right?  And what did TV do? 
[00:59:00]  It embraced it and turned it into a TV show.  It's one of those.  Brilliant.  That's what you need to do.  Yeah.  It's like an entertainment show that's just brutal.  So now they're in bed together.  So you got TMZ on TV.  And then if you need further stuff like the OJ tape that was leaked out, it was leaked  to TMZ, right?  So the TMZ, the TV show, played a little bit of the OJ clip.  We've played a little bit of it here, right?  And then they said, if you want to hear the whole thing, you go to our website. 
[00:59:30]  They're in bed together, working together.  Brilliant.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:00:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Woo!  D.L. Hughley on his way into the studio in a little while.  He should be here hopefully in 15, 20 minutes.  His HBO special is hitting, what, this weekend, I believe?  I'm not sure, actually.  I will find out.  That's why he's coming in.  Don't worry about it.  It was fired.  It really doesn't matter in the long run.  I was just trying to give the guy a little plug.  What's up, Jimmy?  I hope I didn't dump out of that turning Japanese thing. 
[01:00:30]  We should say that we meant no offense by that.  No, none whatsoever.  None.  We got a bunch of other things to get to.  We got Larry King being stupid again on CNN last night.  He had one of the guys in the O.J. mess on, right?  Yeah.  In the know.  And this is what happened last night with Larry King.  All right.  I know exactly what happened in that whole situation from before, during, and after.  But you can't reveal. 
[01:01:00]  I can't reveal it at this time because it could be incriminating and things against me.  Can you give it?  Somebody's talking to my ear going nuts.  Can you give us an opinion as to whether O.J. is getting bum-rapped or not?  I believe he was set up.  I believe the whole thing was a set up.  You see it was taped.  You know, I believe that it was a set up.  A set up?  Who was he talking to?  I don't know.  I think the guy we saw on the other news show, I think so, one of his golf friends. 
[01:01:30]  Probably one of the guys with him that night.  Well, the one guy who's basically saying he did set him up.  He, you know, told old O.J. to get some boys together with some guns and go to the hotel  and get your memorabilia back.  And then he happened to have a tape recorder there.  Who, Tony Orlando?  Did you see that guy?  He looks exactly like Tony Orlando.  What a creep.  He looks like a memorabilia salesman.  He looks like a guy who steals footballs and then takes that awful blue pen and just  forges them.  That's what he looks like. 
[01:02:00]  It does seem like a business full of scum.  They're garbage.  But, I mean, for O.J. to barge in there with the thugs and guns.  Perfect.  I should have shot them.  Look, it's Honus Wagner.  You spelled Honus wrong.  Oh.  Something like going crazy in my ear.  Yeah.  Captain, they put creatures in our bodies.  It was con. 
[01:02:30]  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  I hope it's the Grim Reaper whispering in Larry's ear.  Good.  People talking in my ear.  It's right after the show, Larry.  Right after the show.  Might want to.  Oh, damn it.  Maybe I could take another garlic.  Will that give me another day?  Or some Welch's grape juice.  I'm hearing something in my ear and I got no earpiece in.  What does that mean?  Am I having a stroke? 
[01:03:00]  I smell burning hair.  Stupid Larry King.  It's just this pacemaker saying it's time to change the battery.  Beep.  Beep.  What's that beeping from inside my chest?  Right.  Is that my pacemaker?  Yeah.  I love that.  Love Larry King as he gets older.  Can't get enough of him. 
[01:03:30]  Hey, Ray Romano dumped at the Emmys.  We talked about this before the break.  Just here's the clip.  The cleanest guy ever, by the way.  Come on.  But Anthony made the observation that it sounded like he said the F word here.  Yeah.  It seems to me that a lot has changed in TV in two years.  For one, from what I hear, Frazier's...  We have TV children. 
[01:04:00]  Wait.  What a great dump.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  That dump system is the worst.  Oh, boy.  Is that how it came on TV?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's exactly what they heard on TV.  Yeah.  It seems Frazier.  Wow.  The end.  Roll credits.  Regular radio.  Regular TV.  Just stupid.  That's the headline today.  And I'll tell you why.  Because in the paper, one of the first things I read, Emmys, ratings down 20%, lowest ratings 
[01:04:30]  in like, I don't know, 10, 12 years.  Good.  Because people know there's not going to be a surprise.  There's not going to be any surprises, no moments, no memorable anything.  It's boring.  I had an intense conversation with someone in the know yesterday, and I said, this is  what the problem is.  When you start dumping out of Ray Romano's thing, all he said was screwing.  What's the big deal?  You used to be able to say that on TV, and you could still say it on TV, by the way.  There's no FCC violation against them.  When you start dumping out of radio shows when they're using just basic language that 
[01:05:00]  people use on the street, people are educated enough, and they take all this in and realize,  wow, I'm not going to see anything crazy when I watch the Emmys.  I'm not going to hear anything crazy when I listen to my favorite radio show.  So they're going elsewhere.  They want to be surprised.  They want that wow factor, like, oh my God, did Ray Romano really say that?  They're making it so safe that you, the viewer at home, you know there's nothing to see there.  So what do you do? 
[01:05:30]  You go on the internet or somewhere else where you know you're going to be a little more  shocked or surprised.  And people don't have patience because of the immediacy on the net, and the fact is you  can literally punch in an Al-Zarikawi beheading thing.  I mean, I use that example a lot, but it's the most barbaric thing you can see, and watch it.  You can punch in any type of uncensored comedy and watch it.  Nudity and watch.  Why would you wade through commercials and boring musical numbers just to hear emasculated,  unfunny jokes that your mom approves of? 
[01:06:00]  Right.  Who wants that?  I want to hear Ray Romano say screwing.  I want to hear what Sally Field has to say about the war, whether I agree or disagree  with her.  You want those moments.  I think that would be very interesting TV.  I want to see some lunatic run on stage and tackle one of the presenters.  The most memorable moments from any awards show has always been those controversial moments,  those standout, if they're cutting-edge funny or something happened, you know, a surprise. 
[01:06:30]  No one remembers just somebody blurting out a name and having an award given and them walking  off.  It's always something.  And that's why no one's watching these awards shows.  They've castrated them.  And the video music awards used to kind of goof on award shows in general, and I used  to watch every single year because it was just insane, the stuff that was going on.  And then they started taking themselves too seriously, and they cleaned their act up,  and they started censoring performers, and now they even tape performers ahead of time.  Yeah, they've got to safe it up. 
[01:07:00]  So I sit there at home like, why am I going to spend three hours on this?  I know I'm not going to see anything edgy or, you know, surprising.  Yeah.  There's so much competition out there right now.  This is the time to really push forward with edgy stuff on regular TV and regular radio.  And you have lawyers.  How about this?  Make them do their jobs and fight for what you're doing when it's right.  Like, it's that simple.  Is that a lawyer's job?  Yeah.  Fight for what's right?  Believe me.  As I said that, Dee Snider should have walked in, removed his pants, and slapped me with whatever 
[01:07:30]  was in his hand right across my mouth.  Lawyers should just, we should just see them raining down onto the streets from their offices  and just splattering onto the street.  But then I'm like, I hate lawyers, but then again, like, people sue.  It's like, even though lawyers encourage them, people do it.  So it's like, people are scum.  Americans are just a bunch of sue-happy little bitches.  It's because of a lawyer, if people sued and it wasn't entertained, if people just said, 
[01:08:00]  you know, your case is stupid, it's frivolous, it's crap, then they wouldn't keep suing.  But these lawyers insist on picking up these cases, and that's why, you know, lawyers get  this reputation of being the scum that they are, because they do that.  And then when you want them to fight for you in a situation in broadcasting, they're not  there for you.  They're there for, you know, to whisper in the company's ear, we better watch it. 
[01:08:30]  No, I've been working my slide rule, and I've seen that the benefit here is not worth the  risk.  Right.  That's what they do.  Benefit against risk.  And they don't even look at what the actual product is.  They just see, ah, we can't have that.  Let's not even work at trying to get it.  So, you know, who wants to watch safe stuff, really, in the end?  No one.  Well, let's just hope that we're here, and hopefully that we're here next month.  Ah, we'll always figure it out.  I'm not worried. 
[01:09:00]  I'm not worried.  We're adaptable.  We're so adaptable, and we'll find a place that will embrace us in what we do in the  end.  I'm not worried about it.  But, Jerry in Connecticut, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, there's a poster that has an old picture of the Red Sox, and it says, like, Red Sox  2004 champions, and it says underneath, it says, Yankees stink.  Someone went to the human resources department and complained about it in one of our guy's  office.  And what happened to that guy? 
[01:09:30]  Did he have to take the poster down?  No, he didn't.  I mean, the department was kind of like, you know, somebody complained, but we're not going  to do that much about it.  But the buzz got around, you know, and it was kind of like, one of my friends, like  he had, he was a Red Sox fan.  He actually crossed out the stinks and put, emit an offensive odor and said, now, is that  politically correct?  I would love to know who came up with the concept human resource department.  Do we need that?  Did we really need that? 
[01:10:00]  Why do we?  Ah, never mind.  But people are allowed to complain anonymously, too.  That's another problem, is you never have to face the people who complain anymore.  Right.  So it's like, if people have to complain and then sit in the office with you, they would  be probably embarrassed half the time at the idiocy of what they're doing.  And if they're like, well, that's to protect.  Hey, look, if you're going to complain and try to have somebody's life altered, then you  should have to face the person.  Yeah.  And look, here's...  Howard.  I'll simplify it.  For the most part, work sucks for just about every single person listening to this radio  show right now.  We have a great job in the end. 
[01:10:30]  We certainly do.  We can't even really call it a job.  But for the people that are in their cars right now, their job sucks, and they know  it.  So what do you do?  You try to make it a little more fun by maybe having a poster of a girl in a lousy bikini  or a cartoon or something.  And now you can't even do that.  You can't even try to make your day a little better by bringing some personality into your  sucky job.  A mechanic can't put a Snap-on Tools calendar in his toolbox because the girls are too suggestive. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  You got a human resource department that's looking at everything.  They're checking your computer.  You're still getting your job done.  What harm is it if they go on some saucy websites in their free time or in between calls or something?  The job sucks to begin with.  And people figured out a way to kind of make it more interesting by doing these things.  A couple of lofts, maybe.  A poster, a t-shirt you might wear to work, a cartoon, pictures, whatever it might be. 
[01:11:30]  And they're taking all that out of you.  I mean, you can't even go to an auto body shop and see a calendar of a hot woman.  It's gone that far?  Yeah.  They make them take them down now because it offends people.  The fire department here in New York, you're not allowed to have crazy stuff on your lockers.  I mean, are you crazy?  Leave them alone.  It offends ugly broads.  Do you know that?  It's never hot women.  It's always people like Gloria Allred with her fat old lady head.  It's always ugly broads who either have really short hairdos or are aging. 
[01:12:00]  Those are the ones who don't like it.  Big and fat.  But just the fact that you're not as hot as you used to be, so men aren't looking at you that way, so it bothers you that they're looking at other women that way.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry.  That's exactly it.  Of course it is.  Sorry.  And no one tells them that.  Look, you're an ugly broad.  Godspeed.  Well, this one to the spine.  This will lead into the Isaiah Thomas thing.  I'm so confused.  I don't know what's going on with this case.  I'm sure Ant will help me here and educate. 
[01:12:30]  I'm a little iffy on this case, too.  I heard it on the news this morning, too, as I was driving in.  And I'm like, what the hell is this?  They're saying the B word on the news.  Right.  And Isaiah Thomas, I just assumed he was banging a real ugly chick at work.  But now I don't even think that was the case.  I know.  I don't think it goes that far.  I think it was just some edgy language that got him in trouble.  Edgy?  Well, when I heard them say the B word.  Did you see me go edgy like this?  I know.  Thank you.  When I heard them say the B word on the news, I was trying for the life of me to figure out 
[01:13:00]  what the hell they meant because it could not possibly be, bitch.  Couldn't possibly.  I'm going through all the B words thinking, uh, um, bunt?  No, it's bok choy.  I told you already.  Bok choy.  I can't say bok choy anymore.  Broccoli rob.  Yeah, broccoli rob really needs to make up its mind.  Is it broccoli or rob?  Broccoli rob.  I like that stuff. 
[01:13:30]  Broccoli rob.  You want some of this?  They should just say, you want some of this?  You just have a key thing like broccoli rob.  You want this, this thing that almost looks like broccoli that kind of tastes good unless  you eat the stem?  Oh, whatever.  What are we talking about?  I don't know.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  That's what it'll be.  In a big country dream, stay with you.  Like a lover's voice, park the mountainside. 
[01:14:00]  All we have to stay on the line.  Oh, it's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  80s New Wave Tuesday.  You got to stop with the stupid days of the week stuff.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Look who's in studio.  D.L. Hughley, everyone.  Hey, man.  I'm late, but it wasn't my fault.  That's all right.  And don't pay attention to the 80s New Wave.  We're kind of goofing on the fact that this is the type of thing other radio shows do.  Yeah, absolutely.  If that makes sense.  Absolutely.  Okay, good. 
[01:14:30]  You got to have a day of the week thing.  Right.  Freaky Fridays.  That's what they tell you.  Yeah, yeah.  Freaky Fridays.  Yeah.  You got to have things like that.  Or else you're not a successful real radio show.  And the bosses listen and then they go, why don't you have like days of the week?  Right, right.  So we come up with like crap for days of the week.  Because the guys who did the calendar already thought of that.  Yeah.  Just admit it.  We're embarrassed that D.L. might just walk in and think that we're just sissies.  We're like, no, we're just doing this to be ironic. 
[01:15:00]  We have to explain everything.  No, thanks for pointing that out because he walked in kind of at the wrong time.  Right.  Because we would have had fun with that song and Ann would have played his little slide whistle to it  and we would have goofed on it.  But you walked in, big star, big comedian.  We're like, uh.  Right.  Uh.  Don't pay attention to that song.  Didn't want to look like a dick.  You know.  As soon as you leave, though, tune in the show and you'll hear us just goofing on it.  And you might even laugh.  Because some of the people out there do laugh.  Is it okay to laugh anymore? 
[01:15:30]  Can you do it?  No.  That's what we're trying to figure out today there, D.L.  Speaking of which, let's go to Brian in Michigan.  This is really interesting.  Brian, go ahead.  Hey, we've got our Beaners Coffee Shops here.  Pretty popular.  Definitely 10 to 1 compared to Starbucks around here.  And I was just in there after I've been listening to you guys talk about censorship in Grand Lodge here.  And they've got to change their name.  Not going to be Beaners Restaurants anymore.  And the funny thing is there's two ladies in there while I'm there. 
[01:16:00]  They can't even figure out why until I had to point out what angle people are looking at it from.  And it's just ridiculous that it's a coffee shop.  Well, the name they're changing it to is just irritating.  They're changing it to Big B's.  Big B's Coffee.  What do they have to do it or somebody?  Well, here's the story.  Thank you for sending us up there, Brian.  Are there any actual Mexicans in Michigan?  Yeah, right. 
[01:16:30]  Boy, did you take that.  You damn near crossed two borders.  Do you really think Mexicans when you're thinking Beaners Coffee, though?  Who thinks that?  No, I'm saying, but that has to be what they think.  Of course that's the thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It says many folks in West Michigan can't start their day without the morning cup of coffee.  All right.  One popular Java joint is changing its name.  Beaners is changing its name, like Jimmy said, to Big B's Coffee starting January 31st.  The change comes out of concern that the name Beaners is considered a disparaging term among Hispanics. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, but any Hispanics in Michigan is in the Witness Protection Program.  That's the only reason they'd be up there.  Why the hell?  What the hell is there?  Why the hell is there?  Is there a lot of agriculture in there?  I would think, yeah.  Michigan?  Well, in the rural areas, I would think.  Michigan's a weird spot because you got, like, Detroit in it.  Right.  But then, on the outskirts, it's like farmland.  Yeah.  Ted Nugent's in there shooting his crossbow at people. 
[01:17:30]  Yo, Hillary is threatening the potential president.  Yeah, you get Ted killing his own dinner every night.  Right, right, right, right.  The hell is going on in Michigan.  Right.  Has Carlos Mencia been to a Michigan?  Is that what the problem is?  Right, right.  He's spreading.  Beaners, yes.  I don't understand that.  I'm sure no one even complained.  It's another panicky Pete.  Of course it is.  Like, we've been saying all morning, you can't do or say anything anymore.  You know, it's so, what was I, you know, because they had a funeral a couple of months ago for the N-word. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Which messed up 45 minutes of my show.  It's people in my family I can't even talk to now.  How come you don't call?  I don't know what to say to you.  I know.  I was in mourning to it.  Ruined my whole commute home.  Right.  But, you know, it's so funny because more black people die from eating fried foods and not exercising than ever heard the N-word.  Yeah.  Like, you don't go to the doctor and you say your cholesterol's coming down.  But, have you been saying the N-word?  Your blood cells are starting to sickle.  What are you talking about?  It's exactly what we were talking about. 
[01:18:30]  Like, why not take up some real important issues?  Because that isn't.  It's too hard.  You know, it's too, like, no matter what anybody says, it isn't the violence or bad schools or drugs or, you know, the biggest problem in our communities is that 70% of children are born out of wedlock.  Like, too many single mothers are raising kids.  That's the deal.  But that ain't going to get you on the news.  And it hurts me when I see a single, beautiful black woman struggling to raise a child.  Because if she didn't have that baby, I'd be trying to get something.  You know what I'm talking about? 
[01:19:00]  Only time a man comes by is when he's there to read the meter.  Are you my daddy?  No, I'm here to cut your gas off.  Well, why are you here?  Will you teach me how to ride a bike?  I don't know.  You got a picture in your mind?  Is she double joining?  Can't she keep a secret?  I just think that everything, the things that we try to fix it, like, like now, like, I remember they had a protest in front of FYE music stores.  And kids don't even go to music stores.  They steal it off the internet like everybody else. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  Who goes to the music?  In two years, those, that business won't even exist.  Well, yeah.  They shut down the Tower Records, man.  Right.  It's being phased down.  No one's going to have it on.  It's antiquated.  Like now, like even Master P, he's going to start a rap label with no profanity.  They already have that.  It's called jazz.  And, you know, it's so hypocritical because you can't go to Walmart and buy a record with graphic content or violent content, but you can't go to Walmart and buy a gun.  Yeah.  You can't get the new 50s. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, that's the big argument right there.  So we can band songs about guns.  You just can't have a.  Yeah, it's all this.  I said it for years, it's the symbolism is more important than the substance of something.  So if you make this symbolic gesture that you're trying to curtail violence through getting the lyrics of rap songs and comedians cleaned up, but the actual violence is fine.  Right.  Just let that alone because that's too big a problem to really deal with.  Real cute because it's almost like they blame comedians and rappers for the coarseness of America. 
[01:20:30]  Like, like it wouldn't have been slavery if it wasn't for, you know, being me, Mark.  I'm starting it.  I mean, like we like it's just almost like if you see the word.  I think that, you know, you have a responsibility to talk about the things you see.  And if people don't like the pictures, change the things we see.  Right.  As opposed to talking about the way that we discuss it.  Yeah.  People are always very confused as to whether the media is causing the problem or just a reflection of it. 
[01:21:00]  But yeah, we before television or radio, there were people, you know, thrusting swords through each other's abdomens.  You know, it's just the way it was.  We're very, we're very, very, very violent nation.  Very violent.  Violent nation.  I think we're a violent planet.  I think.  No, no, no.  We got, I'm telling you, there are more, there are more children between 12 and 17 in prison in Southern California than any other country in the world.  Wow.  Any other country in the world.  I'm not, I'm not a country in the world. 
[01:21:30]  So we put people, we're violent.  That sounds like a good stat until you realize they probably kill them in the other country than not put them in prison.  Well, you know, they're there.  They're just buried somewhere in a forest.  Yeah.  Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of 12-year-olds with no hands for taking candy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For spitting on a sidekick.  Yes, that does this.  And everything's entertainment like OJ, man.  And let me.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the OJ thing.  We've been waiting for this.  If you get away with murder, don't mess up no more. 
[01:22:00]  That's pretty much it.  Don't you go, hey, you know what?  I hear you, bro.  I hear you now.  I'm not, I'm not.  Stay squeaky clean.  Right.  Because they're watching you closely now.  And he's been such a good guy for a few years, you know?  Like, he just goes, he smiles.  Everyone is still getting his autograph.  It's like, if you want to hear the horrible thing, though, there's one of the guys that he's arrested with is a guy I used to play golf with all the time.  And every time he was playing golf, he would get OJ on the phone with me.  So now, you know, he's like, do you want to talk to OJ?  I'm like, nah. 
[01:22:30]  No, I really don't.  I got enough problems.  I don't need to hang out with OJ.  So now, you know, that's the biggest news.  And you know he's going to jail.  You know he is.  White people, y'all going to get him back for the.  Oh, you kidding me?  I think.  Oh, you kidding me?  Yeah, it's one of those deals where everyone was just waiting for him to trip up.  Oh, man.  And this is really, whatever happened in there, it's really one of those things that if it was anyone else, you'd just plea bargain it down. 
[01:23:00]  Like, I will get a basic assault, nothing thing.  You get a little probation or a slap on the wrist.  This is going to be.  He's getting a death penalty.  The penalty, right, for killing two people is going to be put on him now.  Right.  And let me tell you, and then they say, well, he's a, you know, they want to let him go because he has no ties to the community.  He's a flight risk.  And then he's not a flight risk, but do you remember that slow speed?  Yeah, yeah.  How do you try to get away from the police and save gas? 
[01:23:30]  Make a commitment.  I want to be free, but gas is $4 a gallon.  Jesus.  Cowling is looking at a phone somewhere just hoping it's going to ring.  Where's Al been?  Where's Al Cowling's been?  Oh, man.  Trying to avoid it.  And Johnny Cochran was a good friend of mine.  We did a bunch of stuff together.  We used to do AT&T commercials.  And he's not, I mean, he got vilified for just doing the job that he was supposed to do.  He's a great attorney.  I mean, I'm telling you what, you might have said a lot of stuff about him, but when you got in trouble, he's the man you was going to call. 
[01:24:00]  Well, I think if you're a black guy, that's who you want to call.  I don't think, because he was a pro.  No, he played the race card with the Mark Furman thing.  I think he turned that jury around.  It ain't really hard to, like Mark Furman is.  Well, yeah, but if you, believe me, talk to any, and I've said this before, talk to any white guy.  They've used the word.  No, I don't care. 
[01:24:30]  Don't lie to me.  That's what I hate.  It's like.  You show me a white person and they said the N-word and I'll show you a two-year-old.  I'm sorry.  We've got to conclude Mississippi.  That's the first word they say.  And you almost forgot a poorly raised two-year-old.  Right, right, right, right.  He's speaking early.  People are lying.  And it's just a plain fact.  It doesn't even, you don't even have to be racist to use it.  No.  It's just the fact that when someone pisses you off in life, you want to throw out the worst possible thing you can to that person. 
[01:25:00]  So if you're driving down the street and I get cut off and I'm almost driven into a wall and I catch up and look over, if it's an Asian person, I'm going to throw the worst Asian slur out.  Not yell it out, but it's going to go through my head.  Right.  I'm going to think, and I'll probably say it in my car with the windows rolled up.  Let me point something out.  I think Jimmy saw it too.  You're exaggerating your story.  How?  You say these words if someone just merges a little too quickly.  Right.  All right.  Someone didn't use a blinker.  Right.  Boy, you pissed me off.  How come I couldn't have an extra bag of soy sauce? 
[01:25:30]  And he almost runs me off a cliff.  So now, D.L., you understand that I had him.  You understand now I had him.  Right.  The guy's shooting at me.  Right.  I was, I was.  Are you kidding me?  It is so, like, like, and I'm not, you know, look, I just, I was here last time I was here.  Right.  There were the two, there were the three brothers that had shot the police officers.  Right.  Remember that?  And they had gotten away with it.  And then they found fingerprints on a bucket of chicken.  Remember that?  That's true.  Now, that's N-word stuff.  Like, I, that's the stuff that you, now, I can't make that up. 
[01:26:00]  But to, to, to act like I know brothers and I know people I would consider the N-word.  And there's a difference.  If I'm hanging out at a cool restaurant, that's all right.  Brothers is cool to hang out.  But if a fight break out, it's the N-word I'm called.  Somebody that got a police record and ain't scared to get hit in the face.  That's what I need.  Hey, have you, have you stopped, uh, cause you're, you're an edgy comic man.  You, you don't ever, uh, uh, uh, kind of try to appease people.  Have you, have you, cause Eddie just got in trouble, Eddie Griffin.  Yeah, but Eddie got in trouble.  You know what? 
[01:26:30]  Eddie got in trouble because, why would you book him for that?  Right.  Well, explain, Jimmy.  We gotta reset that.  Well, for anyone that didn't hear Eddie Griffin.  I think it was a black entertainment magazine.  It was a very conservative.  Right.  It's, it's, it's like, you know, the Kiwanis Club for black people.  Right, right.  It's like, why would you book a dirty...  Right, it's people that laugh like this.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, so they book Eddie Griffin.  It was extremely edgy.  Right, yes.  It was the N-word, right?  It was the N-word, right?  But he was dirty anyway.  Right.  They wouldn't have liked...  So they kicked him off the stage.  But you book him for, you know, to make these placatory, I just, it's, it's just things 
[01:27:00]  I can't, I can't stand when somebody pretends like they're, they're trying to  do good, but they're really only trying to, to, you know, you can fight causes that get  you on TV, but really don't accomplish anything.  And that's, and that's what I see.  We're just exacerbating the problem by acting like it's the coarseness of words, like it's  the music that did it.  You know, I ain't never seen a remix kill nobody.  Like now when you do drive-bys, you're playing a great R&B hook.  That's great.  I mean, I don't...  It's constantly in the news where someone will jump on a cause. 
[01:27:30]  Uh, we've, we've talked about the violent video games.  Right.  And, and people love saying that that's the reason for school shootings.  Uh, and then you look at the circumstances beyond the school shooting.  Here is, they call them social misfits.  Uh-huh.  Social misfits means that some girl ain't having sex with some dude.  If you want to stop school shooting, tighten them up.  Hand out more trim.  You know that dude who walks in, some find somebody to give him something. 
[01:28:00]  Right, right.  That's the deal.  That'll make some frustrated people.  He just simplified it.  You don't ever see a dude having sex shooting up school.  Yeah.  I mean, really.  That Asian kid that shot up Virginia Tech.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the quarterback of the high school football team is not shooting up the school.  No, no.  I think DL's on to something.  And you always saw, I mean, going through school, you always saw the kid that was a little  off.  Right.  And you're like, oh boy, this guy.  And he was constantly just berated.  Right.  And that was one of the kids that could have just, at any moment, snapped and come in  and shot people. 
[01:28:30]  Save a life, hire a hooker.  Yep.  Get him some.  I like that.  That's it.  Save a life, hire a hooker.  It's really, it's really out.  We need t-shirts.  That's a good one.  Social Memphis are people that don't fit in because nobody's giving them that.  We need to take a break.  You're hanging for a little bit.  Oh, absolutely.  How was your, did you just fly in from LA?  Yes.  The red eye?  Yes.  And you're this funny?  And ever since of the word, it was a red eye.  I applaud you today, man.  Oh, man.  Every time we've had to take that red eye, I can't even like, I can't even function.  You need like 20 hours of sleep. 
[01:29:00]  I was wondering what I was going to come into this morning because, you know, every time I turn  around, you guys are suspended or there's some kind of crap going on.  Jim is being death threats.  I don't understand.  You know, but God bless you because a lot of celebrities canceled our show because of  our controversy.  So we have a long list of people that will not do our show because of the crap we've  gotten in.  Anthony Michael Hall.  Ben Kingsley.  Ben Kingsley.  Danny DeVito.  Al Roker.  Yeah, Danny DeVito.  Look, Danny DeVito, he'll get drunk on The View, but it won't come in.  Yeah, but it won't come in here.  So you challenged us.  There you go.  That's just a bunch off the top of our- 
[01:29:30]  A bunch of them won't come in.  Jessica Alba's people won't let her come in.  Just a bunch of them.  Well, if Jessica's not coming, I can't come here.  Her and, what's the guy?  Dane?  Dane Cook.  They did that movie.  Yeah.  He's actually coming in.  His publicist passed on us and then emailed Dane.  I'm like, well, how come you're not coming in?  He goes, oh, no one talked about it.  I just saw Mr. Brooks on the plane.  How was it?  I just saw Mr. Brooks on the plane.  Hey, man.  You don't want more people.  You want me to be honest right before it comes in?  I did Soul Plane. 
[01:30:00]  I have no right to talk about anybody.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Kevin Hart, you've never seen anybody brutalized the way we brutalized Kevin Hart when he came  back to New York for that movie.  But you know, Kevin was young and he didn't really know what to do and it was his first  gig.  I knew how horrible it was.  I sold out.  I did it for hardwood floors and drapes for my wife.  And I knew I was doing it, too.  It was horrible.  I cast my check with a mask on.  I kept telling everybody I was JJ from Good Time. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, Rick, before you do it, what is the HBO special?  Yeah, we want to promote your stuff there, Dio.  It airs Saturday.  Saturday on HBO.  It's called what?  Unapologetic?  Nice.  I like the name.  10 o'clock HBO.  And then you're going on tour and then the DVD of the HBO thing.  comes out Tuesday.  Yeah, we decided we beat the bootleg.  No kidding.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, brother, we're bootlegging.  Why are you doing it?  They bootleg Soul Plane while we were shooting the movie.  I'm doing this on the scene.  I'm watching my scene right now.  But, yeah, I'm excited about this.  Somebody there with a camcorder just taping every scene. 
[01:31:00]  That's kind of brilliant, man.  Editing it together at home.  Premiere Saturday on HBO.  Available on DVD Tuesday.  Wow.  DVRs, man.  They know people with DVR on it, so they probably put some extras on there.  And they're smart.  They want to get it out.  I have a question about Soul Plane.  Wait, wait.  How was the plane so big?  It was a very large aircraft.  How did it fly?  That was my main complaint about the movie.  Well, it was the Cadillac of planes.  It was, that was horrible.  All right.  We got to take a break.  More with D.L. Hughley after the break. 
[01:31:30]  You know anything about Isaiah Thomas, this whole story?  We're trying to figure it out.  Apparently she was a...  Hold it for after the break.  But we're not really sure what's going on here.  We'll get into it next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Girls on film.  Girls on film.  Girls on film.  80s New Wave Tuesday.  Girls on film.  Wesley Willis, man.  Oh, Wesley.  Chicago's own.  Who's now dead.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  That's a hell of a segue.  He's gone.  He's gone.  He was a class act, though.  He was like a homeless guy that was, what, schizo?  He's seen Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Yeah.  I love that one.  He's like the white slidstone, huh?  No, he's black.  No, he's a black guy.  Yeah.  Dang.  I didn't even know.  Nice.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony in studio.  We love when he comes in here.  D.L. Hughley.  Don't forget to watch him on HBO this Saturday night at 10 o'clock.  Saturday at...  Wait.  I'm guessing... 
[01:32:30]  Oh, this is another thing you got me promoting.  All right.  Saturday at 10 o'clock on HBO.  Yes.  Unapologetic is on HBO this Saturday night.  Okay.  There you go.  Tuesday's the DVD.  HBO is really brilliant.  Right after the special.  Right.  I give the DVD.  It has extras on it.  And to really confuse people, because I got confused, then you're going to be at Town  Hall Saturday, November 10th at 8 p.m.  You can go to Ticketmaster for tickets to see D.L. Hughley when it comes to New York.  Right.  November 10th.  Okay.  There you go.  He's here.  We go to break.  Hot in my wares, Jack.  That's it.  D.L. 
[01:33:00]  He's so damn good.  We go to break and we just continue the radio show.  And then I'm like, we got to do this on the radio now.  He's got things to say about Michael Vick.  Well, you know what's funny about Michael Vick?  Really.  And I respect the fact that, you know, if he, and I've seen dogfighting, and I thought  it was a horrible thing.  Even when I was a kid, I went, man, I just don't see what the point of this is.  And he, you know, dogfighting aside, the fact that he killed dogs at losses, I think, you  know, and he killed dogs that were losers, and he plays for the Falcons. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  I don't care.  Kill Warwick Dunn.  Why don't you kill your offensive line?  You know the dogs had to be going, man, I lost a fight, but you just lost to the Raiders.  Damn.  He should be drowning his own teammates.  That's what you're getting at.  And, you know, it's this love of dogs.  Getting some new players in there.  Oh, my God, that's brilliant.  Right.  And, you know, it's the inconsistency.  Like, Leonard Little, 1998, played for the Denver Broncos.  He killed a woman drunk driving.  He did three months in jail, four years probation, two years later, drove again. 
[01:34:00]  They threw the charges out.  I guess another DUI.  They threw the charges out.  Then he got a six-year contract extension.  He killed a dog.  A police officer in Arizona left his dog in the car.  It dies.  He gets charged with, you know, mistreatment of animals.  A woman in Ohio leaves her kid in the car, and it dies.  And we only in this country do we have this reverence for dogs.  I got five of them.  Like, in other places in the world, dogs are fooled.  Yeah.  Like, you go to China, you ain't going to see a lot of folks walking dogs. 
[01:34:30]  Because you don't walk fooled.  You go to Englewood, you ain't seen black people walking chickens.  Walking around with a Louis Vuitton chicken leash.  Yeah, but in fairness, I got to say, a lot of these other countries have never seen what  a dog can do once peanut butter is applied for them.  You learn to respect dogs when you're like, wow.  You don't get tired fast, do you?  Good point.  I love that observation, though.  They must just laugh at Americans.  They're like, those stupid people are walking their own food.  And the dogs are going, how do I get there where I'm that important?  And that's what it is.  It's just that we are so inconsistent. 
[01:35:00]  Like, you know, just like Bill Belichick and Barry Bonds, the country was berating Barry.  We should put an asterisk next to a name.  He's a cheater.  And Bill Belichick possibly influenced games, division titles, Super Bowl titles.  And they talk to Philly.  They think, hey, it might have cost them a Super Bowl.  Right, right.  Even the referee, who might have cost Phoenix a chance to do.  Those things are actually more important.  But nobody's coming on.  Barry Bonds, you know.  I changed my tune on him.  I don't care now.  Me neither.  I don't care what the player's doing to hit the 800-foot home runs. 
[01:35:30]  I really don't care if their head is twice the size of ours.  I don't care.  Make the game interesting.  That's all I care about.  If you're willing to have your nose the size of raising it, that's on you.  If you've got pimples the size of golf balls on your back, but you could hit a 600-foot  homer.  Popeye arms.  Look, God bless.  With your eyes closed.  Who cares?  God bless little fat Hank Aaron.  But he, and this is in fairness to Bond.  I don't care about the steroids because he, Bond's is facing tougher pitchers than Hank  Aaron was at the end.  And it's just a reality, whether people like it or not. 
[01:36:00]  I don't care if he takes steroids.  If he's willing to do that to his body to entertain me, I'm kind of for it.  I don't care if you sneeze and your head goes.  Let your brains dribble out when you're 60.  That's your problem.  And you know what else we all cheat?  You know that home office everybody claims?  You ain't got no damn home office.  You got a computer on your desk that you use to watch porno.  Home office.  Sending them dumb emails to each other.  Did you see Beyonce fall?  Yeah, man.  You're right.  I mean, I said it a couple weeks ago.  I appreciate the cheaters out there. 
[01:36:30]  Where do you cheat?  I was bored in school and college.  I could have got good grades, but I found it more interesting to find an interesting way to cheat.  Right.  Come on.  It made it more exciting for me.  When did we become this more?  Even now, I just don't dig it.  Like this Larry Craig in Idaho.  Right.  For conservatives that hate gay people, they sure try to screw a lot of bitches.  Yeah.  I mean, and I don't understand.  I didn't even know tapping your foot on the bathroom floor was a symbol for gate six.  Who knew? 
[01:37:00]  We learned a lot.  I'll never go to the bathroom with an iPod again.  That's what we, yeah.  You're just kind of hanging out, tapping your foot to the music.  Are you hitting on me?  No, I have the new Kanye album.  Are you crazy?  Yeah, man.  You're going to leave me alone.  And then when you tap your foot, what happens?  Does the penis come out the ceiling?  Like a box in the house?  Drops from the ceiling.  It's like confetti.  A bunch of penises.  Right.  And then sex in a men's bathroom.  Have you ever been to a men's bathroom that was so nasty, you just use the bathroom on yourself? 
[01:37:30]  Isn't that the last place you'd want to have sex?  Even if it's with a hot woman?  I don't care.  I've never been in an airport bathroom that didn't smell like 20 guys were going at the same time, too.  They just, it reeks.  You're into that type of sex, though.  That's like a little perfume spray.  A little potpourri.  By the way, that bathroom stall is now a tourist attraction.  People are checking it out.  Apparently it always was.  That's probably an excuse like the gay guys are using. 
[01:38:00]  No, man, it's a tourist attraction.  I want to just check out the stall.  Yeah, I'm just checking it out.  Take a picture of my ass.  Tap my foot.  All the straight guys are shuffling in the bathroom.  I don't want to tap.  It's like, I won't even put my luggage down on those floors.  It's like, with wheels, I hang that.  Yeah, you figure out how to do everything you need to do with one hand while you're holding  all your possessions.  I don't really, this whole, but it's the idea that, but even that, aren't we supposed to 
[01:38:30]  be fighting terrorism?  Didn't you just have a bridge fall down in Minnesota?  Couldn't you have spent some resources, instead of checking out dudes in the bathroom, maybe  checking out to see if the joints on the bridge was going to hold up?  Yeah, bust and dump a bunch of people into a river.  I can't get past the poor cop that that's his gig.  He has to sit in a stall all day long, catching creeps.  Do you think that's what he thought of when he said, I want to be a cop?  Yeah, what did he do wrong that he got that assignment?  He looked like he had that kid.  He was a handsome cop.  I almost understand Larry Craig's point. 
[01:39:00]  If I saw that guy in the next stall, I might be tempted, too.  And why do they roll out their wives and stand next to them?  And that's good if you got a high wife then, but if your wife looked like Rosie O'Donnell  on Caretap had a baby, I'm going to think you get it.  Yeah, you're almost like, oh, well, now I understand.  I mean, look what he's...  Who wants a special early winters?  Right, look what he has at home.  And they brought out his adopted kids, because he didn't have any kids.  Right.  Oh.  All right.  Sounds like he was doing something wrong.  And it's always these guys, either these religious holy rollers or the politicians, the holier-than-thou 
[01:39:30]  politicians, that are always a little too against something than everybody else.  Like, I could take any cause, like children, like that whole thing they're doing with the  predators and everything.  I think everybody could pretty much assume that's a pretty low-life, scummy thing to do  to kids, is to go in and try to pick up a 12-year-old. 
[01:40:00]  But these guys that are so like, my God, we've got to save the children.  Those are the guys I think you've got to watch.  You know what I don't understand?  Remember when we were growing up?  Let's have a real conversation.  The 15-year-old girl, hot girl, dated a 21-year-old dude in college.  Absolutely.  That happened all the time.  The hottest girl in my high school was dating a senior in college.  So now, all of a sudden, it's a matter of perspective.  Like, I don't understand.  There's a kid in Atlanta who had consensual sex.  He was 16. 
[01:40:30]  She was 16.  Right.  Or consensual oral sex.  And he's in jail for 10 years.  Yeah.  That, to me, is like government or, you know, bureaucracies trying to legislate.  I mean, that's just...  Do you know, for that kid, Jimmy Carter has written a letter for him.  The state's attorney...  That's probably why they're holding him.  It's stupid Jimmy Carter.  You know who the state's attorney is?  Who?  I mean, the attorney general of the state is a black man.  Well, there's one of those guys that's trying to get him out.  It's, I think, the prosecutor...  It's one of the prosecutors...  The attorney general for the state of Georgia... 
[01:41:00]  Is that who's holding him in?  ...is a black man who is basically saying that if we let him out, then there are 110 other  people that kind of fit the same curriculum.  Wasn't his daughter, was it?  Right.  Because that's a reason.  It's a technicality they got the guy.  That's all it is.  So he'll stay because they have...  What was the age difference again?  The girl was 16...  16 and 17 or 15 and 17.  Yeah, just...  But it's a child predator thing.  Yeah, yeah, got it.  Complete technicality.  How the hell are you saying?  Ridiculous.  That's crazy.  At a party.  That's what I don't get. 
[01:41:30]  And what is the point of being 17?  If you're 17 and you can get a girl to blow you, you should be revered.  If you could actually like...  You have work in that?  Yeah, that's right.  Like my son, he's 18.  He came to me and said...  You have an 18-year-old son?  Wow.  He said, I really don't know what to say to girls.  I'm like, you got a Mustang and a Rolex.  What is there to say?  Pull up in front of school and park and somebody have sex with you.  If you don't believe me, let me borrow your car and your wife.  And tell your mom I went through the store.  I just don't understand. 
[01:42:00]  Like these politicians don't get...  We don't care what you do.  Just be good at your job.  You could...  Like if you won the war on terrorism, secure the borders, and stop global warming, you  could screw all the dudes you won back from now.  Yeah, we don't even care.  If you're going to govern like a...  If you're going to act like a Democrat, govern like one.  Damn.  I got to back up slightly.  The Bill Belichick.  So you think it's amazing that it's like a double standard, right?  That he's allowed to continue coaching with the Michael Vick thing, being kicked out of  the league like he has. 
[01:42:30]  You see, Michael Vick, even if you watch what's happening in Notre Dame, right?  Ty Willingham was, what, 10-2 and got fired.  Charlie Weiss, this is...  They're negative 14.  I mean, they're negative 14 yards.  They haven't...  In three games, they've got 14 less yards than everybody else, and he's going to keep  his contract.  I think there's just a way, when you're a black man and you look at these situations,  you go, wow, that seems odd to me that he would be...  Ty Willingham would get fired with a winning record, and he gets to keep his job with a 
[01:43:00]  losing record.  And Notre Dame has this huge television contract that they get every 10-year contract, and he...  You finally got me.  I don't know the Notre Dame thing.  They haven't won a game all year.  Right.  They scored like four points.  But he's just under contract?  Why?  Well, there was a black...  Notre Dame had a black coach, Ty Willingham, before they hired him.  Okay.  And they fired him because they said he wasn't productive enough.  Okay.  But he was 10-2, ranked like eight, top 10 in the country, lost some big games.  So why was he fired, do you think?  Because he was at Notre Dame, and Notre Dame wasn't... 
[01:43:30]  Just doesn't like the black coach?  Well, Notre Dame wouldn't say that, but they'll say that he wasn't productive enough.  Then they hired this guy from the...  You know, he was one of the assistant coaches with the Patriots.  They bring him in, and an alumni.  And he has minus 14 yards after three games.  And he isn't doing...  He's doing much worse than him.  He'll keep his guy.  Are you serious?  He has minus 14 yards?  Minus 14 yards.  Let me explain to non-football fans.  That's 14 yards less than zero.  Right.  That's not good.  Just case you're not a sports fanatic, that's not good.  He got the ball and ran backwards.  Basically, he ran into the stands behind his own goal. 
[01:44:00]  In three games, you can't get one yard.  Right.  And you, the coach.  That's what I don't...  And so, even when you look at...  You're just surprised there's not more outrage over the Bill Belichick.  It's almost like it's done with.  It's almost like he affected...  Donahay, the referee, affected the game more than Michael Vick did.  And Belichick affected the game more than Barry Bonds.  These are individuals.  You're talking about the coach who sets up a system where they can cheat.  Shouldn't they have to forfeit the game? 
[01:44:30]  I think Jimmy was saying...  They should forfeit the game.  I mean, I think he should have to sit.  They just hit him financially.  Like a half a million...  If you screw up a half a million dollars worth as a coach, you should be booted.  Or at least have to sit.  You should be suspended until they look into it further.  Out for the year.  And see, you know, his involvement, all that.  Where was this big investigation?  You're absolutely right.  The guy should not be coaching that team right now with what he did.  And I think...  And then he gives press conference, like, I won't discuss that. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, now I won't discuss it.  It's behind me.  It's over.  It just happened.  And what the hell?  It just happened.  And Michael Vick gets kicked out of the league.  And it had nothing to do with what he's doing on the field.  And you could argue, you know, this whole personal thing.  And this, you know, it shows that...  Because people will claim what he did to the dogs, that's more a thing on your own personality.  And it shows that you don't have this professionalism to play the game.  Or you're irresponsible as a human being, instead of just affecting the game itself.  Right, right, right.  Because it didn't affect the game. 
[01:45:30]  Right, right, right.  But what Belichick did...  If Michael Vick would have won some championships, he would have been a winner.  And more people...  See, you know, it's great when you're potential and you're flashy and everybody loves it.  But when you can't win, then there's a tax on paper.  Belichick is a winner.  So I'm not saying it's all predicated on race.  But it is clearly a high...  When you're the coach of an organization and you impact the...  You know, that is an institutional thing.  They have said, we're going to cheat and we're going to do whatever we can do to win.  And I remember Tomlinson said something about him last year from the Chargers. 
[01:46:00]  He was talking about Belichick in the playoffs last year.  And I just kind of thought he was just mad because he lost.  But now I'm like, this dude is really...  Yeah.  It's very suspicious.  I'm wondering if the NFL knows this has been going on with a lot of teams.  You know what I mean?  You never know.  Something is way too suspicious here that they kind of like downplayed as much as they did.  It went away.  And then they just moved on.  This went away.  This whole story went away.  Take the wig rights.  I disagree with DL.  Though he's great. 
[01:46:30]  Belichick didn't break the law like Vick did.  He just broke a league rule.  Just broke a league rule?  That's a pretty big deal what he did.  That's what we're saying.  He didn't break...  Michael Vick didn't break a football law.  He broke a moral law.  I would love to see Michael Vick play this year.  The moral circumstances...  Michael Vick should obviously suffer whatever the penal codes have for him to suffer.  Sure.  Belichick broke a NFL law.  He broke a...  Yeah, and Michael Vick is in trouble with the league because he violated their conduct policy. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  Isn't cheating?  That should be a conduct.  Yeah, that's what I was saying before.  That's a conduct.  That's part of your character.  You're a cheater.  You're cheating.  And you're the coach.  Didn't even have a married mistress at one point too in New York was in all the papers.  Hey, who cares?  I don't care about that.  That's fine.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Mr. Morality.  No, no.  I don't personally care.  Yes, you do.  No, but I'm saying if they're going to snivel...  I'm telling you, there's something to this.  It's coming in a lot right now.  Jim from Syracuse.  You guys aren't bringing up how every team in the NFL does the same things. 
[01:47:30]  The patch is just not as good.  I'm telling you, I think this is going on with every freaking team.  Every baseball player...  Nobody believed that Mark McGuire hit all those hormones by himself, but Barry Bonds is the anti-crash.  That's what I'm saying.  Be consistent.  If everybody gets in trouble, we should all get in trouble.  Don't say...  Now, the argument now is that everybody did it, so it's cool for Belichick to do it.  Well, if everybody did it in baseball, then it's cool for Barry Bonds to do it.  You can't...  Let's be consistent.  I think that a coach's philosophy, his philosophical approach impacts the entire organization. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, three months after McGuire left the game, did you see what he looked like?  Yeah, me.  He's just sitting there.  He's crying in front of Congress with the glasses on.  Right.  He looked like Barney Fife.  He has my body now.  And he's hitting golf balls.  Yeah, what happened?  He's like a scratch golfer.  You can't be a scratch golfer if you're on steroids. 
[01:48:30]  He had the giant arms.  He stopped doing the steroids, and now he has a fine short game on the golf course.  Yeah.  How did that happen?  I can't understand it, man.  It's just...  But not to...  You know, I think that it's just ironic to me.  I'm not...  I mean, you know, they're going to do what it is they do.  I just think that part of the gig is to see inconsistency.  There's a lot of stuff that I think is personally...  Like this dog thing, Michael...  And I'm not...  You know, there's a place in Texas  where they fly in exotic animals just to hunt them.  And drug them and hunt them. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  That's pretty brutal.  It's absolutely brutal.  Hell yeah.  There's no real sport in that.  Let's get the bear drunk and have them stagger around.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, animal pornography is illegal.  And have you ever seen how happy a horse is at the end of that?  You never see an unhappy horse at the end of a shoot.  Have you...  I think we've been to the same place in Tijuana.  Hey, we got to get Sonia on that.  You can't talk bad about Belichick without taking a phone call.  You got to at least take one from Boston. 
[01:49:30]  Sonia, what's up?  They're listening on BCN up there, Deal.  You can't talk bad about Belichick ever, ever, ever.  All right.  The bottom line is, is if they were a better team,  no matter what we took pictures of,  they would have done something with it.  Well, sweetie, but the idea of cheating is,  if it's wrong for one team to cheat, it's wrong for...  Let's throw out all the rules, the personal conduct rules,  and just say you can do whatever you got to do to win.  Well, yeah.  Whatever you got to do to win. 
[01:50:00]  That's fine.  Why not?  Landmines?  Landmines on the field.  All right, cool.  But don't...  Well, that would make the game a lot more...  She's saying it's okay to cheat on crappy teams  that you would win over anyway.  Right, right.  Come on, what is that?  I'm telling you, I got to say it again,  I think most of the NFL teams were doing this.  Yeah.  And that's why they're kind of downplaying,  like, ugh, let's not let the cat out of the bag here.  Right.  But then don't vilify Barry Bonds  when most of the baseball players were doing this.  I'm with you.  What I've read, it sounds like Bonds is just not a nice person. 
[01:50:30]  But I've changed my...  Belichick is not a nice person.  Well, I've read that too.  But I've changed my tune on Barry Bonds.  If he's doing steroids, who gives a crap?  They did talk about an asterisk with...  Hold on, madam.  They did talk about an asterisk with McGuire too.  It just wasn't as harped on, I think.  The asterisk was a little darker with the black guy.  Yeah, exactly.  The time comes right now.  I mean, I don't really care.  I mean, do whatever you're going to do.  I ain't going to piss nobody off in Boston.  Boston is the scariest place I've ever been.  Boston is scared in South Carolina to me. 
[01:51:00]  Are you crazy?  So you win, madam.  They are so far behind the rest of them.  They got their own system up there.  It's like the...  Their segregation is just classic.  They got rivers in the way and all sorts of stuff.  Like, oh, we're not segregating.  It just happens to be a river in the way.  River, railroad tracks.  They seceded from the union a long time ago.  They got their own thing up there.  I've never been nowhere where black people were scared to go.  Like, unless the police was involved.  Right.  I was talking to this cat who played... 
[01:51:30]  You know the club, Comedy Connection.  So I'm talking to this cat, and we wanted to go to this bar,  and he said we had to go in the South Baltic.  He's like, oh, no, no.  Oh, no, we don't mess around there.  So I'm like, oh, wow.  I mean, so it's pretty bad.  Yeah.  Scared in South Carolina.  One of my favorite stories of...  I forgot the Celtic player, black guy.  Robert Parrish.  Was it Parrish with the car?  They thought he stole it?  No, that's everybody.  That's Paul Peer.  That's everybody.  But it was a Boston... 
[01:52:00]  Sebastian Tell anybody.  It was a Boston Celtic great.  Who was it?  I want to say Jojo White, but I think it was after Jojo.  Who the heck was it?  Somebody in Boston will help us out.  Kevin McHale?  I can't...  Bill, Bill, what, what?  Just driving his...  My parents say he wouldn't go back there.  Just driving his brand new BMW, what have you, and they pulled him over and just assumed  he had to have stolen it.  Yeah, you had to have stolen this.  Oh, yeah.  What black guy in Boston that isn't new edition?  And then the bridge story is classic for Boston, too. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, the Charles Stewart, of course.  Charles Stewart.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, some black guy.  What happened?  They're great at blaming things on black people up there.  Charles Stewart basically stabbed his wife and then threw her over the bridge.  And he shot her.  Shot her.  Shot her.  His pregnant wife.  I mean, I'll give him credit for this.  He shot his pregnant wife, and then he did kind of shoot himself.  Shot himself.  Like, so it did look like a carjacking, and then he threw the gun out, and he said this  black guy did it.  So Boston police tore up black neighborhoods.  Oh, were they going crazy?  It was field day.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  In South Carolina.  Yeah, yeah.  She drowned the kids in the river, and the black guy did.  And it's always the same black guy. 
[01:53:00]  It looks like a cross between Jason Kidd and Billy Ocean.  Like, it's...  Billy Ocean.  It's like this...  You don't even...  Billy Ocean.  Like, how do you get that combination together?  But it's always so.  Wow.  Like, yeah.  Yeah, and it's so funny, because all you've got to do is say he's a black guy.  Yeah.  Well, Charles Stewart did shoot himself in the stuff.  You've got to credit that.  Like, that guy had what you call stick-to-itiveness.  Yeah.  He didn't just throw out a silly cover story.  But, yeah, and then he wanted to be...  But the cops figured that crap out, because they always shoot themselves in a way. 
[01:53:30]  Like, oh, come on.  Not fast.  Yeah.  You've got to really...  Oh, they had enough time to rip apart some cars.  Wait, wait, wait.  We didn't find nobody look like Billy Ocean and Jason Kidd.  It was Dee Brown.  Thank you for coming up with that.  I would say your name from Pal Talk, but I don't...  It's something.  Yeah, once he realized that the cops were on to him, he jumped off the Tobin Bridge, I guess.  And killed himself.  Up there and killed himself.  What's with all these dudes killing their pregnant...  I don't get this thing pregnant-wise.  That's what...  That seems to be...  That's kind of a white guy crime. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  You know, the pregnant wife.  And then for a few days, they're like, oh, please, help me search for...  And he's helping in the search.  Yeah.  And you're just looking, going, oh, this guy's going to be in cuffs in days.  I love the...  Don't kill him.  Just be a dead, be dead.  Just leave.  Right, right, right.  I love the guy that's helping in the search, but he never goes where everybody else is headed.  Why is he way over there?  We already checked that area 10 times. 
[01:54:30]  Stay away from the garbage can.  I think there's something over here.  Ignore that tarp in the yard.  What is this hump in the Rose Garden?  Spraying Lysol in the air.  Come over here.  Hey, we've got to take another break.  Are you with us?  Oh, man, I ain't good.  You're good?  All right.  D.L. Hughley, a lot to promote with D.L.  HBO, this Saturday night.  I wish I didn't have food in my mouth.  10 o'clock.  Unapologetic.  There you go.  HBO this Saturday.  We're hearing great things about your special on HBO.  I'm having a good day.  Saturday night at 10.  We hit it off down in Washington when these guys were taping their HBO shows. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, we were both in trouble.  We were both on the outs.  Yeah.  It was cool to meet you for the first time.  It was like he knew.  It was kind of neat that you knew who we were.  I'll be honest.  It was really cool.  You know what it is.  Yeah, the scourge of society at that time.  We both were pariahs.  That was bad.  And I was getting protested.  I'm getting protested by religious leaders, Christian religious.  I'm like, if you're a Christian, forgive me.  Right?  Yeah, right?  It was all about forgiveness.  But I think we take it away tomorrow.  That's what we thought back in the day.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  But they don't really forgive.  That was tough.  No.  And then Unapologetic will be on DVD Tuesday.  A week from today.  Okay, a week from today.  And then you're playing Town Hall in November.  November 10th.  Saturday, November 10th.  Yeah, Ticketmaster.com.  November 4th in Trenton, New Jersey.  Oh, my God.  You got a website with all this info?  I don't even have a website.  Oh, boy.  I don't have a website.  Wow.  I don't know, man.  All right, if you want DL's info, MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  I didn't even know MySpace. 
[01:56:00]  I'm so out of the technological.  Yeah?  You're out of that loop?  Oh, man.  I refuse to go with that whole fake friend thing.  No.  I'm one of the few, I guess.  Where you don't want 20,000 or 100,000 or a million friends?  I try to make real friends.  I don't need the fake friends.  That's what it is.  Good luck.  I know.  I only have a few.  I have a few.  If you got two.  Eh.  My mom went, ah, whatever.  Don't mom it.  No, mom's your friend.  Don't get on the motor.  Don't.  Well, my mom, I mean, in high school and stuff, you have friends everywhere, right? 
[01:56:30]  And she said, by the end of your life, if you count your friends on one hand, consider  yourself lucky.  I used to laugh at her.  But the older I get, I'm like, damn, she's right.  In the end, you die into your own arms, Tony.  Right.  Wow.  We must have had the same mother.  Are you my friend?  I'm your mama.  Now, sit down.  I remember when I asked my father, and that's what it was.  They were so pragmatic.  I asked my father.  I said, do you love me?  He said, you son of a bitch, you ate, didn't you?  It's like, you can't just get an answer.  Right.  You think I'm going to feed somebody I don't love?  Sit down. 
[01:57:00]  What are you, gay or something?  Sit down.  All right.  More with DL Hughley after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah! 
[01:57:30]  This is no...  Can you tell DL Hughley stepped out of the studio?  By the way...  We don't have the balls to do this in front of him.  You're a creep for knowing that. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  It's my little wacky whistle.  I think 80s New Wave Tuesday is a hit.  Of course it is.  80s New Wave Tuesday!  You want more better dog for me?

Hey, have we talked about everything we need to talk about?  No, there's a great headline in the post.  It's amazing when an assault victim, gym victim, is wheelie angry.  Wheelie angry?  Yeah.  Must involve some type of bicycle apparatus.  Yes.  Of course.  I know it.  I read the story.  This is a really funny story out in New York. 
[02:00:00]  And I kind of don't know who to like in this one.  It's a Manhattan, like this hedge fund manager.  Oh, I'll tell you who I like after you.  We both know who I like, too.  I just had to set that up that way.  Oh, okay.  Who's loud grunting and cheering during the Upper East Side spin class allegedly led to  this fed up broker on a bike nearby to break his neck.  is furious that prosecutors are not treating this as a felony.  So they're having a spin class.  Spinning is like the, you get on some stationary bike, right?  Real men spin outdoors. 
[02:00:30]  You just ride a bike.  I pass those spinning classes in my gym all the time.  It's for girls.  Yeah, girls like get on the bike.  Don't tell me it's a good workout.  I don't care.  And they go and it's like, woo, come on, ladies.  And they play like music and they got to pedal real fast.  And they, woo, come on, ladies.  Come on, ladies.  We're spinning.  Woo.  And they get all like, all revved up.  Yeah.  Yeah.

[02:02:00]  We don't have the right machine hooked up for the.  Everyone's waiting for.  All right.  Of course.  The victim's name.  Yeah.  He doesn't sound.  I can't tell.  Stuart Sugarman.  Aw.  Stuart Sugarman.  I like to make real wolf movies.  I've been waiting for that all day.  Yeah.  But that's only the second most popular clip on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm very disturbed by that.  It's the one.  If I'm hiring this secret competition.  People don't understand that.  Who has the most popular clip on their machine? 
[02:02:30]  And when one of us gets a really good clip, the other one gets a little jealous.  A little jealous.  And I thought I had the number one clip and now everyone's into the oof.  Oof.  And damn, you've been pwned is very big.  Yeah.  But I must say, I, yesterday, walked around my house and me and my girlfriend and just  nonstop going, I want to make werewolf movies.  I like to make werewolf movies.  Movies.  I am the werewolf. 
[02:03:00]  I am the werewolf.  Wolf.  Iraq, can you find me more of those clips?  I don't think we farmed out all the good clips from that bit.  I could not stop doing it all day.  Attack of a Teenage Were-Dope.  Yeah.  Were-Dolt.  For the most part, the listeners just hear these clips.  They don't know really who's playing them.  You know, like I.  Special Endeavor.  Special Endeavor.  And there was a little jealousy.  It's like, I need a really good clip.  And I also had the Smoker's Clip. 
[02:03:30]  Yes.  So I was on fire with getting the better clips lately.  And then you got the.  But then this gem.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  Just been pwned.  By the way, DL had to like call a radio show or a TV show or something.  He's going to come back a little bit.  A very popular gentleman.  And by the way, in Attack of the Teenage Were-Dope, what happens is whenever there's a full moon,  his tongue shrinks, his hair grows normal, and he attends a college class.  But then the morning comes and he's just a fat-tongued, Pete Rose-haired idiot all over again. 
[02:04:00]  Laying there on his bedroom floor drooling with papers that he doesn't understand around him with writings on him.  Like Danny said yesterday, he has no idea he's a star.  He's just somewhere drooling and looking at pennies as food.  And he has no idea that he's like a star as far as our show goes.  I like to make werewolf movies.  So getting back to the spinning class story, I just want to jump in here, Jimmy. 
[02:04:30]  So this guy, what's his name?  Stuart Sugarman.  Stuart Sugarman's in one of these spinning classes, and I guess he's a workout fanatic, and he really gets into it.  The problem is, in the middle of the spinning class, he's grunting, and...  He's noisily war-whooped, groaned, and shouted, you go, girl, during the workout.  Yeah.  He's obnoxious.  Yeah.  He's moaning really loud, like, ugh.  More than obnoxious.  You know, when the speeds are getting too...  Did his bicycle have a seat on it? 
[02:05:00]  And he's whooping?  Yeah, war-whooping.  War-whooping the instrument.  What's a war-whoop?  I don't know.  Woo!  I'll get rolling in here to do a war-whoop.  Woo!  But there's another broker, with three bikes over, yelled, repeatedly yelled, shut the  F up, and then leapt off his swing and came charging at him.  Dude, did you hear what he did to the guy?  He threw him and his bike up against the wall, and he basically...  He just fractured his neck. 
[02:05:30]  Wait, he picked up the bike and the guy...  He had it with this guy.  Something tells me Mr. Sugarman, is that it?  Mr. Sugarman wasn't very heavy.  You gotta use the old OJ line, but I understand.  Yeah.  The Chris Rock line, cause...  It's wrong what he did, but you understand.  We've all been in situations like that, where you wish you could just pick up the guy and  his bike and throw it on the wall.  And his bike.  Oh, yeah.  The guy was an animal.  Guys, probably some big guy and little Mr. Sugarman went flying.  No, but they were both over 200 pounds.  Really?  I'm guessing... 
[02:06:00]  I'm gonna guess that Sugarman was probably the last bike near the wall.  That's my guess.  And that this guy probably just kinda like pushed him.  Charged him and pushed him into it.  Cause he probably...  He yelled, repeatedly yelled, shut the F up.  So the guy was probably just wouldn't stop doing it.  And sometimes in life, the only way to stop a man of questionable preferences from war whooping  is to shove him against the wall and break his neck.  We all know that.  So, Sugarman is disappointed it's not a felony.  And it should be a felony.  He's right.  Yeah.  I mean, he...  The guy assaulted him. 
[02:06:30]  He broke his neck.  I mean...  We have a war whoop.  Here's an example.  All right.  All right.  No, that's just E-Rock when the instructor said that they would have to do 10 minutes on  the bike.  Heather writes...  Where's Roland?  We want a war whoop.  Heather from Jersey.  This has to be read before we get off the air here.  You disgusted me today.  You allowed DL to make a race issue out of the Vic and Belichick issues. 
[02:07:00]  Newsflash.  He made a good point.  Newsflash.  Vic committed a felony.  What about Ray Lewis, OJ Pacman Jones, Michael Irvin?  Is everything a race issue or only when they get punished?  He raised a good point.  And he didn't scream about race.  He also said he thinks it might be a part of it.  But he also said the fact that he's a coach on a winning team has something to do with  it.  He wasn't screaming about race.  But it is an interesting point.  The bottom line is the fact that Belichick is not being punished at all, except for that  stupid fine, is something to do. 
[02:07:30]  You know, look.  If I was black, I'd probably say the same thing.  I lean toward Michael Vick being allowed to play and Bill Belichick getting kicked out  of the league for a year.  Because what he did affected the actual game.  Or at least just, you know, consistency.  That is inconsistent as far as player suspensions, coach suspensions go.  So that, to me, went away.  For some reason, why did that just go away?  And I think it's what Ope said.  I'm telling you.  This is very widespread.  And they just want to put a cap on it as quickly as they can. 
[02:08:00]  I think the NFL is more pissed at Mangini going, what are you doing?  Why are you blowing up everyone's spot?  We all know everyone's doing this.  Why are you being a sore loser?  That's my gut feeling.  Yeah.  And now they're like, oh, now we've got to do something.  So they do this.  They know they're going to have to look into this dynasty if they do anything about it.  They've got to go back and look into all these games like they're doing with this  referee in the NFL and the NBA and go, all right.  I bet you they sat Belichick down behind closed doors and said, look, we all know the  whole league is doing this.  But now, you know, Mangini calls you out here. 
[02:08:30]  We've got to do something.  We've got to make it look good.  So we're going to hit you hard with a fine.  We're not going to take the win away from you guys.  You're going to have to lose a draft pick and then we're going to move on.  Business as usual.  That's my gut feeling on the whole thing because it doesn't make sense that that's all it was.  That it just goes away.  Every other story in sports where there's a controversy, it just goes on and on and on.  And now we've got J.D. from Maine.  No, it didn't.  You dolt.  The commissioner said on national TV it didn't affect the game's outcome.  He cheated.  Who cares if it did? 
[02:09:00]  How does he know?  God almighty, will you stop defending him just because he's from Boston?  He cheated and he got caught.  End of discussion.  He got caught.  I know.  As we're leaving, D.L. Jubilee, a really, really funny comedian.  His special is this Saturday on HBO, the following Tuesday on DVD.  And D.L. is a great comic, so I highly recommend this special this Saturday.  And we're doing a New York comedy festival.  Not as personally New York is, obviously. 
[02:09:30]  We usually do something for the comedy festival.  We're not doing anything this year?  I'm not this year either.  But D.L.  Hughley is playing.  November 10th.  November 10th.  Town Hall.  Town Hall as part of the New York comedy festival.  Yes.  I'll be all over the city that weekend because I love.  They do a great job with it.  Take us through Ticketmaster.com to see D.L.  Hughley in November here in New York.  And also, off the subject, I want more E-Rock on the website.  The fact that I couldn't find this dumbbell, no disrespect, crying on the website. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, where is that?  Why is that not there?  That's got to be there.  I don't want to see cam girls.  I want to see this blithering, fat-necked dumbbell.  And I mean that with respect.  Crying.  It doesn't matter.  It's okay.  Fine.  All right.  Call them whatever you want.  It's fine.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Yes.  As we leave you.  Cursed.  Sorry.  What happened?  Did you curse?  What happened, Jimmy?  What did you do?  So close.  I dropped an F-bomb to myself. 
[02:10:30]  I realized.  Why were you?  What happened?  Why were you dropping it?  That's why I just said I cursed.  I didn't hear it.  I did.  You know they're going to have to fire you now.  Jeez.  That was the F-bomb.  It doesn't go through.  I don't want to get fired, but I told them.  But they said they have to fire.  People for saying the F-bomb.  He's flipping switches trying to get back to the...  Where was it?  I said it to myself a few seconds ago.  I just thought we're off.  I'm thinking it right now.  Watch.  Oh, that was a bad one.  No, we're off the air.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:11:00]  That was a real bad one, I just thought.  Wait, let me do one.  Good.  Do a real bad one.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want the worst one possible.  Wait a minute.  Here it goes.  Here it goes.  Here it goes.  Watch.  Watch his face change.  Oh, man.  I thought the worst thing you could possibly think, and if it went over the air, I would  be fired and killed.  You know, the next day, we're going to have a meeting with the lawyers, and they're going  to...  Don't think bad things.  They're going to try to control our thoughts. 
[02:11:30]  They know what you're thinking.  Yeah.  Everyone out there filled in there.  Filled, uh...  Ah, whatever.  Whatever.  Can we just go?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Please.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  We never did Once Upon a Potty?  What's wrong with us?  Once Upon a Potty?  E-Rock's pointing out some XM-only bits. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  Just when he thought we were calling in this portion of the show, we got material.  Let me turn on the sound.  Uh, Once Upon a Potty.  Very good.  What is this?  Shit jokes?  Seattle, a comedian gets punched by two female audience members.  Ah, half.  Old.  That's kind of old, right?  It's him, right?  What else you got me?  Got for me.  Norton and Florentine from the good side of bad news.  Yeah, just go to Super Deluxe if you want to see that.  You don't want to do that today? 
[02:12:30]  I don't even know what they have.  No.  All right.  I say go to Super Deluxe.  Super Deluxe.  All right.  Basically, fuck Jim Norton and fuck Jim Florentine.  Language.  Whoa.  Fox lets the word shit over the air during the show Anchor Woman.  Really?  Uh, that'll kill.  Eight seconds.  And then we'll all giggle.  And we'll...  Oh, shit.  We'll laugh because it's a curse on regular TV.  That's right.  I'm buff.  Oh, sorry.  Uh, it's Opian Anthony.  Hey, uh, I'm looking at Pal Talk.  That's why I said that's right. 
[02:13:00]  I'm buff because someone said I'm buff.  But I'm not really buff.  But whatever.  Uh, we're doing a Miss Pal Talk contest.  Do you know about this, Anthony?  I've heard tell.  I don't know when the final date is.  I like to say pray tell.  I...  No, well, I hear tell.  Hear tell.  Pray tell.  I hear tell.  Ah, yes.  I hear tell.  Pray tell.  I don't know.  I've been so bad today.  I haven't been giving them sound when I'm supposed to.  Don't give them sound.  Nah, I've been pretty bad this morning. 
[02:13:30]  They yell at me.  Where's the sound?  All right, let's...  Where are the tits?  Well, you're going to see tits on Friday.  Here it is.  Live in the ONA room on Pal Talk on Friday.  We're going to have the first ever Miss Pal Talk contest.  Miss Pal Talk.  Winner will receive $500.  $500?  What are the rules?  Are they allowed to be nude?  Should be.  Has to be.  There are no rules.  So they're allowed to have an ass gave? 
[02:14:00]  Thunderdome rules.  Thunderdome rules.  Nice.  Yeah.  No rules.  So there will be gaping of the ass?  Whatever you guys need to determine a winner.  Gaping.  Make your ass look like an opera singer.  Oh.  No.  Yeah.  What is...  What's the criteria for Miss Pal Talk?  See, now we didn't even think about this.  You've just said Thunderdome rules.  Is there poise?  Is there going to be a personality? 
[02:14:30]  A question and answer?  Things like that?  A swimsuit?  No.  Or is it just going to be nude women?  Girls get on.  They're naked.  And then...  Redrum's trying already.  Is she?  Can I have her camera up?  All right.  Let's see.  She's got a nice virus shirt on.  Yeah.  If the girls want to practice today, we can help you out with your moves.  Like Redrum is flashing us right now.  There you go.  We'd have an early leader right now.  That's it right there. 
[02:15:00]  Miss Pal Talk contest this Friday.  Anything goes.  There you go.  We'll wear the little boy shorts.  Very nice.  Her hiney.  That's nice.  Little boy shorts are sexier when there wasn't an actual little boy sitting on them a few  minutes ago.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, the little kid kind of messes it up there, Redrum.  No, it doesn't.  She looks the same as she did before.  I know.  She got her body back in shape.  I'm just kidding.  Well, she did.  For a while there, I was worrying.  Wasn't looking too good.  If it's Miss Pal Talk sleeps, then Flight Benefits wins. 
[02:15:30]  Holy shit, Flight Benefits.  Wake the fuck up.  And show us your boobies.  What do you got?  Mono?  Oh, Jesus Christ, that chick can sleep.  Is she dead?  Rumpel Klitzkin.  My God.  She is out.  Well, we'll see what she comes up with for the Miss Pal Talk contest this Friday.  $500.  That's it?  The winner gets $500 lousy dollars? 
[02:16:00]  They don't have to leave their house.  They just got to sit there.  Who's getting all the plugs?  Fucking Pal Talk?  That's right.  I said fucking Pal Talk.  Wow.  Come to the table.  You know how much advertising you've gotten from this show?  They should be paying us.  Well, you're not.  We should have 10% of this company at this point.  Fuck Pal Talk and their...  You know what?  Fuckhole.  Easy.  Yeah, and their fuckhole.  Easy.  Sometimes you got to, like, strong arm these people.  Easy.  Hey, $500 lousy dollars? 
[02:16:30]  We got some hot women.  We want $550.  I say $1,000.  Wow.  I say $1,000 fucking dollars for the women.  Well, then you better talk to somebody back in sales.  Whose account is this?  We're negotiating right now.  What show is it?  Will?  Get Will on the phone.  $500 lousy dollars ain't going to get the job done.  We mention Pal Talk every single day.  Guess what?  Perhaps more than that, Ope.  You know, Tom's bitching because I mentioned FH Riley's too much on the other side of the show. 
[02:17:00]  We also mentioned Pal Talk an awful lot.  Why don't you go after them for some cash?  I think they did.  We've given them so much free advertising.  The least they can do is get us $1,000 for this contest.  Contestants are free to do whatever they want on cam to win this Friday.  Miss Pal Talk going down on the Ope and Anthony show.  But is it the most, like, disgusting thing you can do? 
[02:17:30]  Is it the sexiest?  Is it, like, I believe some girls will be confused.  It's anything goes.  It's like the old wet t-shirt contest.  Wow.  You know, the skankier one usually wins, even though you've got a hot piece of ass up there.  But she doesn't show her boobs and she loses.  That's true.  So I'm thinking, you know, you're going to have to do some talent.  All right.  Someone's letting me on to somebody showing something here.  And I'm not the one bashing flight benefits, Bill Kaye from Philly.  Who's bashing her?  Who's bashing her? 
[02:18:00]  I'm saying she's sleeping like she's got the frigging flu.  And you've got to understand when we're bashing and when we're just having fun.  I was having fun with Red Rum.  She was laughing.  Flight benefits.  And I am a good friend of flight benefits, so shut the fuck up.  Yeah, flight benefits would probably laugh at that as well.  It's a good observation.  If she wasn't unconscious for 12 hours straight here.  Like a junkie whore.  That's right.  I said it.  Opie.  What?  No, I'm saying I, Opie, said it.  Flight benefits is a junkie whore. 
[02:18:30]  That's terrible.  I would love to just be able to sleep like that.  All right.  Let's get Will on the phone here.  Will.  Will.  Sir.  We need $1,000.  Oh, for the Pal Talk?  Well, we don't do the contest.  Yeah.  I think $1,000.  Well, then sir, you shall have it.  I'm dead serious, though, because these girls are going to work hard for us on Friday.  And let's be honest.  Pal Talk has gotten a lot of free mentions over the last two years. 
[02:19:00]  I would say more than a lot.  All right.  So $500 isn't good enough.  It's not cutting it for our fine listeners.  Our fine listeners.  Our fine listeners with slips.  All right.  So let me.  That's a cool grand.  And you will have the money.  There you go.  Nice.  It was that easy?  That was easy.  I should have asked for five.  No.  Now I'm going to tell Will to tell them I think we need 10% of the company.  10%.  That's all we asked for.  Well, on my authority, sir, it's done.  All right.  All right.  It'll be.  Can I say $1,000 or do I wait for the phone call? 
[02:19:30]  Now I'm going to have to go for our fine legal team at XM and make sure that they can change  the rules, et cetera.  Ugh.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Sure.  All right.  Bye, Will.  Later.  That was pretty easy, though.  That was really easy.  To all you slits out there, don't say that Opie never does anything for you.  That's right.  Now show us your gas, Friday.  That's right.  Open your cunt and have my favorite CD fall out of it.  How do you like them apples?  Oh, wow. 
[02:20:00]  We never turned off K-Rock today.  Oops.  Oh, that was a problem.  That could be an issue.  Wouldn't there be a problem if I said cunt on K-Rock and it went through, but I was saying  it like as an adverb?  No, that's fine.  Swing in this.  First one of the day.  Uh, hey-o, Bill K from Philly, you have to understand when I'm bashing and when I'm  having fun.  Oh.  Yeah, but that's the problem with reading words.  We don't know.  We told you to go with the winky eye. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, you got a winky eye when you text, you dummy.  We figured that out a long time ago.  Then I know for sure that you're fucking around.  It's a semicolon.  Then the assholes really trash us, but they do the winky eye.  Then that confuses us.  Then we know that it's winky eye.  It's all about winky eye, because you read this shit, you don't know what's behind it,  what emotions behind it.  All right, so that's pretty cool, right?  Yeah.  Looking like it might be $1,000 for Miss Pal Talk that we're doing Friday.  $1,000. 
[02:21:00]  Can we do this on both sides of the show?  No.  Just XM?  Yeah.  Uh, really?  They won't allow it?  Why?  Because of the nudity?  Even though it's on a camera?  Huh?  We're not getting any money for it.  Just do it.  Oh, it's a financial issue.  Issue?  Issue.  All right.  So that's going on.  Yesterday, we were doing that techno crap.  It's kind of funny.  I was telling Ant off air.  I go to the message boards, and I broad stroke it. 
[02:21:30]  That's what I'm-  You're broad stroking on the message boards?  What threads are you going to?  Well, yeah.  I don't get too deep into any thread, because it always gets just awful.  And it just degenerates.  It starts out good, so I do a little of that broad stroking.  I just kind of get a feel for what the fans are talking about.  Right.  And it's so funny.  Yesterday, that techno thing, I got to bring a lot of people into this show.  We didn't plan on doing that yesterday.  That was off the cuff.  I don't know if people fully understand that. 
[02:22:00]  They probably think that we had that planned the whole time.  Yeah.  Because when I read stuff like it, it was really funny, but it went a little long.  It went a little long, because we were just creating on the spot.  Just winging it, having fun.  Shut up.  Just winging it.  So if you liked the bit, but you thought it went too long, why not just say you liked  the bit?  And then punch out after 15 minutes.  And you know what we do?  The next time you hear that bit, guess what?  It will be a little shorter, because we also understand that it might have been a little  long.  But we were creating on the spot. 
[02:22:30]  Most radio shows do not create on the spot.  They don't have the balls to go for that, or try that.  What are you laughing at?  Sorry.  Iroch loves putting up Harry Potter's cock in his PalTalk window.  Wow.  He just won $1,000.  That was the sexiest picture.  Yes, Iroch is a queer that's coming in now on PalTalk.  But anyway, that was just a little, I just went off road a little bit. 
[02:23:00]  But the techno thing from yesterday, I think, is starting the next listener bit.  Yeah.  Where you can send, what am I trying to say?  Seriously.  The techno bit.  It was fun, though.  Just watching you kind of unravel in a circle.  You were just sitting like in a pile of your own entrails, like that scene in Devil's Advocate  with the baby.  What's happening to me?  I'm talking, and I don't know where I am.  I felt like I was in between innings at a baseball game doing that dumb fucking baseball bat thing 
[02:23:30]  where you spin around, and then you fall down.  And you can't walk.  As I'm trying to run.  What the fuck am I trying to say?  We like when...  Making werewolf movies.  Yeah, there you go.  We like when there's audience participation.  And then once in a while, we get into something, and then it's obvious the audience is going  to get way involved.  Yeah.  That's it.  Did I bring it around?  I think you did a good job.  So the first one came in today from, of course, Coke Logic.  He's doing his own techno remix like we did yesterday. 
[02:24:00]  Okay.  All right?  And it sounds like this.  You've got AIDS.  You've got AIDS.  You've got AIDS.  You've got AIDS.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[02:24:30]  Nothing to the table.  PUSH! PUSH! 
[02:25:00]  Not bad. That's Coke Logic, the first one coming in.  And you gotta respect Deliver Us from Eva. She's got a glow stick once again.  Every time we go down this road, you gotta get your glow sticks out for it.  So what do you think? Are we onto something?  Yeah, that was pretty good.  That's the first one coming in. 
[02:25:30]  I think there should be...  I see no difference also between that and any other song that's like that.  Oh, no kidding.  They just sound like that.  Absolutely. I think there should be one rule if we're doing this.  You have to have us in every song.  PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!  Let's say hi to Bob in Vegas. Bob!  Yeah, hey, yesterday when you guys were talking about 81 just for the hell of it, I went and checked it out.  If you go to 82, it sounds like the same shit that's on a different channel.  You know, I thought that same thing. What is 82? 
[02:26:00]  There's like three or four in a row when you get up into the 80s and it's like, what is this crap?  No, I had to go to rehab after two of them. I couldn't make it to three or four.  Yeah. All right. Thank you, sir. Let's go to John in Texas. John, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing?  Hey, John.  I just want to let you guys know, regardless of what the board say, I wanted to go ahead and thank Mr. Hughes and let you know.  But I think this is a great bit. I really do. I think we're doing a good thing here. 
[02:26:30]  And I look forward to downloading Anthony's Mixes off-cazar.  I thought Anthony's Mixes yesterday, when he was doing the fart sound, it doesn't get much funnier than that.  Of course, we missed it a couple times. But in general, he was on to something yesterday.  Yes, I put a lot into my art, sir.  All right. Thank you, sir.  Art.  All right.  Like I do with my little flute that I did all day today. I put a lot into that.  That was pretty good. 
[02:27:00]  That was pretty damn good.  Also, overnight, this came in. We've got to play this again.  The Van Halen thing is going very well.  Jimmy, of course, is trying to figure out how the new Van Halen song is going to go.  You know they're going to come up with something new.  But it's got to be just full of cliches and just awful.  And Jimmy has come up with some of the worst ideas possible.  This song doesn't quite capture Jimmy's vision. 
[02:27:30]  No, my vision.  Vision.  Vision.  Of what Van Halen will do when they do record a new song with Eddie and David Roth.  But he hasn't given the listeners enough to work with.  I've got a few more lines that this guy didn't use.  Oh, really?  He probably did this.  Yeah.  And he put together one of the lines from the B-side that's supposed to be on the B-side.  And now he put it on the A-side.  So it's a catastrophe.  Well, the only line from the B-side is the name of the B-side song.  Which is, we're a little bit older, but we ain't much wiser. 
[02:28:00]  That's going to be the name of the song and the chorus.  We're a little bit older, but we ain't much wiser.  Look at what you're doing.  You make me, like, cold.  Yeah.  It's so...  Well, Pete from Morningside took what he heard on the radio.  And he's playing the guitar here, right?  He has to be.  I don't know if it's that or some kind of sideways Van Halen production piece, some kind of background 
[02:28:30]  music.  Remember when we used to have to do production for commercial spots at AAF?  Yeah.  And you'd pick some music and it was, like, alternative or classic rock or something.  And it was some sideways version of a song that was popular at the time?  Yeah.  Danny?  That's what this sounds like.  But perhaps he did.  I don't know.  I'm speaking out my asshole.  Yeah, no.  This is him performing.  Morningside is actually his band.  Yeah.  Well, he got the Van Halen sound down.  Well, then fuck me twice in the asshole. 
[02:29:00]  The more things change, the more things stay the same.  We're back!  Like, it'll be quick.  Yeah, yeah.  It's got to be a little...  All right, well...  Oh, it's awful.  This is more audience participation.  They're on to some.  This is the first one that came in using what Jimmy has said on the radio.  It's Pete from Morningside. 
[02:29:30]  We're back, Pete!  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time.  We've been through changes.  We've played some games.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.  I say, we're a little bit older, but we might fly.  We're back!  We're better than ever. 
[02:30:00]  We're back!  We're back!  We're back!  Together forever!  We're back!  We're back!  We're better than ever!  We're back!  We're back!  Together forever!  We're back!  We're back!  We're back!  We're back! 
[02:30:30]  I don't want to hear that.  It's not bad, though.  He starts off with the chorus.  Because you didn't give him anything else yet.  I gave him...  Give him a little something else.  Wait, it has to be something after we've been away for a long, long time.  Yeah.  Wait, how does that line go?  You think I remember these?  I try to forget them as quickly as possible. 
[02:31:00]  All right, let me think for a minute.  Been away for a long, long time.  Well, they have been, right?  But now we're back.  Well, they've been through changes.  They've played some games.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  I don't know.  Give it time.  Okay.  You're a great artist.  It takes him years to come up with lyrics, so...  Don't put all the pressure on yourself there, Jimmy. 
[02:31:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Long, long time.  Nah, it doesn't...  I know what you're saying, but...  I won't...  I won't degrade...  Don't compromise.  Thank you, that's the word.  Don't compromise.  I won't sell out my vision.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy's taking this very seriously.  He could go with the easy jokes.  He's going...  A little too seriously.  Yeah, a little too...  Right.  Kind of shutting down the whole show for this.  I think the song...  I think...  No, no. 
[02:32:00]  I think the song should start, though.  Mm-hmm.  Like, with, like, somehow, like, they're all ones like, hey, hey, hey, you!  Like, you know how...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you need some of that David Lee Roth crap.  Yeah, a little David Lee Roth-isms.  You know, hey, hey, hey, you!  Do a couple of those.  Because people are looking for work parts out there.  Wait.  Hey, hey, you!  Hey, yeah.  Wait, wait.  Hey, hey, you!  Hey, who is it?  Wait.  How about an all right?  Hey, hey, you!  All right!  Hey, hey, you!  All right! 
[02:32:30]  Hey, hey, hey, you!  All right.  Ha, ha, ha!  Boosie, boosie, bop!  Titty, bop!  Ha, ha, ha!  It's awful!  I can't take it.  Wait, we've been through...  We played...  Okay, wait.  Redding is saying that you definitely need a solo in there somewhere if you're putting  this shit together.  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Jim's trying to work it out.  Yeah, I will.  I can't do it once again.  All right, when you're ready, Jim.  No, it just doesn't work like that.  I understand you're an artist. 
[02:33:00]  When you're ready, you'll let us know the next line.  Okay.  By the way, you know, we're talking about Van Halen.  They're rehearsing.  And we have actual audio.  Yeah.  Now we're out of the bit.  This is real.  It's real audio.  This is real.  They're practicing at the Forum in L.A.  Here's Panama.  A piece, obviously.  There is machine.  There's tubing.  Oh, cut Unreal.  There's a LouArts.  Pull the check. 
[02:33:30]  The air crux.  The air crux.  Burnham, kick in theair.  They're streamed, step in.  You're still returning.  Then you're just a lady.  LC Leil.  There's nothing wrong with me.  You deserve that job.  That's why I'm doing շš.  What the fuck is that? 
[02:34:00]  He can't keep up.  He's behind the whole time.  He's behind and he's...  Because you can even hear that they slow down the song a little bit  to try to get him to catch up.  The bass is terrible.  And he's not staying...  He's not staying with the music.  He's not staying with the vocals the way they were on the album 
[02:34:30]  and the way everyone remembers wants to hear them.  It sounds like, yeah, like a Vegas act that he's doing.  I hate when they change the words, the phrasing of the words,  the accents, the placement.  Sing the fucking song.  You're a stickler.  He can't.  Let's try another one.  Ain't Talking About Love.  And he's not hitting the high notes.  Ain't Talking About Love.  He's not.  This is them performing...  Not performing.  Rehearsing at the Forum in L.A. 
[02:35:00]  Here we go.  He's behind. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Obviously, they're rehearsing.  This is not the final product, but wow.  Actually, that was their final rehearsal.  They had been rehearsing.  Oh, boy.  Are you kidding me?  That was the final rehearsal.  So that's ready to go.  By the way, people trying to help Jimmy. 
[02:36:00]  Thank you, Thomas Overbeck.  Yes, from Dallas.  Say something like, the world is crazy these days.  He writes, I hear that a lot from these old bands trying to put out new stuff.  The world is crazy these days.  Wait, wait, hold it.  It's changing.  We play some games.  Yeah, the world is crazy these days.  I'll put that in there somewhere.  All right.  It really is.  All right.  Because it really is.  It really is.  Here's one more taste.  It's Van Halen, D.L.  Hughley back in studio.  Van Halen rehearsing, because they're getting back together. 
[02:36:30]  We got some audio of them.  Who's Van Halen?  Actually rehearsing.  You got to know.  How come you off the go with?  You got to know Van Halen.  You're right.  I do.  Okay.  No?  Really?  No.  Here's what they are.  I thought you were just kind of making a joke.  No.  They're the white version of, come on.  Of what?  Keith Sweat.  Do you know a true?  Have you ever heard of true?  Of course.  No.  No, you didn't.  See, how come I got to know your things, but you really got to know mine?  Well, Van Halen is just been around for several years.  But Van Halen is like, yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Like since the mid-70s.  Come on.  Are you serious?  Man, this is a true.  I was on the set of Studio 60, which, you know, we got canceled.  But that's how it go.  But, you know, Alana said, and they were talking about, somebody made an album called Graffiti  Bridge.  It was physical graffiti.  Oh, physical graffiti.  Of course.  And I, and everybody was talking about it like, and I didn't know who it was.  Have you heard of Led Zeppelin, though?  Oh, yeah.  But I never heard of this.  I guess that was the, and they were talking about Stairway to Heaven, which to you guys 
[02:37:30]  is Led Zeppelin.  To me, it was the OJs.  They did their own version of Stairway to Heaven, but no, it was just a whole different  thing.  Wait, is it just a song called Stairway to Heaven, or is it the same song, and they redid  it?  No, it's not the same song, but it's Stairway to Heaven.  So, let me hear Stairway to Heaven by the OJs.  See, we can learn something from each other today.  So, we think Zeppelin, you think this.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Right.  We're never going to get along.  Right. 
[02:38:00]  We're never going to get along.  We can't even get the basics down.  It's all over.  Like, you know, like in music class, a classic was Mozart.  To me, it was Marvin Gaye.  I never.  That's really funny.  I never got it.  That's really true.  Do they sing ever?  Yeah, they do.  But after, you know, this is when we was, you know, going through our thing.  It was very nice.  Yeah.  It was a classic.  It's Brothers is hearing that pulling over right now.  Yeah.  With lighters.  I haven't heard this before.  With lighters.  Remember when your mom and daddy was together? 
[02:38:30]  Oh, before you had to run off in the middle of the night and not tell your daddy where  you lived.  This is what they'd play in a Spike Lee movie during a fuck scene.  Right.  When he's got like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  There's some trailing ice over somebody else's stomach.  This is what we hear.  I want to hear him sing now.  Here we go.  On that stairway to heaven.  Right?  The OJs, baby.  This is it.  This is our thing.  They knew how to sing. 
[02:39:00]  Back in the road of ecstasy.  They were doing ecstasy back then?  Yeah.  It's good.  It's an obvious Zeppelin ripoff.  That's their way to handle it.  Wow, that's weird.  See?  And so it's always like, all right, then I think you might not know Van Halen.  See?  Van Halen.  Knowing Van Halen, though, is kind of like knowing Curtis Blow.  Right.  You know?  Because you guys, I mean, there's black cars that white guys just know because they've 
[02:39:30]  been around and they're part of pop culture and much bigger than the community or whatever.  Right.  But you have to go.  And we would say Van Halen has to be at that stage with a black man.  You know what's funny to me?  You know what's absolutely funny?  I grew up in L.A. my whole life.  And I'm not making this shit up.  I lived in L.A. my whole life.  I didn't even know white people lived in the city until I was 19 years old.  Because everywhere we went, like, you got on the freeway, you got off.  It was black people.  You got back on, it was black people.  Where in L.A.?  I grew up on 135th and Avalon. 
[02:40:00]  Which, what part of L.A.?  That's right on Avalon.  The part we don't go on.  On the side.  It was white people there.  It was the insurance man and the police.  I promise you.  I swear to God.  But if you threw a rock across the street, you hit somebody who lived in Compton.  But the other side was L.A.  And I never knew.  Like, I see white people on The Price is Right.  And I tell this story all the time.  And they say, I live in L.A.  And I go, where?  Where the hell are you living in L.A.?  When I was 19 years old, I went to Westwood and said, welcome to Westlaw Center. 
[02:40:30]  And I said, this is where the white folk live.  So we never heard music or anything like that.  So it was always a thing.  Like, I didn't even, like, read until I was 20, 21.  Wow.  Like, I stopped going to school.  You were just born and raised urban.  Just all black.  Did you hear the wow, by the way?  That's where you grew up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was always.  Wow.  Everything was, like, you never.  We would get off.  There's a city called Torrance in California.  Yep.  Where every, if you were black, you got pulled over. 
[02:41:00]  But that was another city.  It's Torrance.  You just got.  Even now, black people will go around Torrance to go to the mall.  Really?  I'm not kidding.  It's no joke.  And that's the only, like, cities like that that I know about where white people live.  But nobody.  And when Mexicans moved in, it was like, wow, these are just, like, black people with good hair.  These are really just niggas who can swim.  Mexicans are black people and white people compromise.  You can have that guy. 
[02:41:30]  But so it was really, it was really, and so I didn't even, I really didn't even, I never  heard nobody else's music.  What's the most popular Van Halen song?  Jump.  I want to jump.  Jump or Panama, yeah.  All right, give me.  Running with the devil.  Well, I think jump.  Probably jump.  TV videos.  All right, go with jump.  Jump in Panama.  Be honest now.  Okay, I promise I'm not.  Van Halen jump.  I'm not fucking.  No, I believe that you're being honest.  I'm just reiterating, I guess.  Give me a little jump for D.L. Hughes.  I know that.  All right.  It's all right.  Yeah, I know that.  I think it's, I think that part's been sampled in a song by a brother. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, but that's really how I know it.  I'm not even kidding.  I think they used that opening in a song.  Now, me and my wife, she grew up in a city called Carson.  And her father, who lives with me now, knows all, like they played all Beatles songs and  all, like he knew everything from Janice, like he was, he is into all kinds of music.  And my wife, consequently, was into all kinds.  Like we would go out when we first went out and she would know songs. 
[02:42:30]  Like my role manager read, he knows all kinds of, I just listened to one, it was K-Day.  That was it.  It was AM.  And you had to be damn near parked in front of the radio station to hear it.  To hear it.  Like white people do things, we're like, if this had been an emergency, black people,  if you turn on music and it ain't on, then something happens.  Then we got a problem.  Right.  But that was, it was just very, and it's like that all over.  If you go all over the country, it's just like that.  People are really just, you know, like in New York it's different because rich people  live with, in California, rich people live with rich people, poor people live with poor 
[02:43:00]  people.  New York, that's from building to building.  Like I had to do, what's the difference between a good building and a bad building?  A good building got a door, man.  A bad building just got a man in the door.  You don't want that.  So it's just so different.  It was, but now my children are all, they like, I, for the, like I listened to, like  I got Maroon 5, I dig Amy Winehouse, I like, even that dude Daughtry, I like a couple of  songs.  It's people.  Oh, Chris Daughtry, he has an amazing voice.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like people that I listen to now that I would have never listened to before.  Give him a couple more years, I think he's going to be singing some amazing things. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  So it's, it's.  Because the shit they, I mean, it's poppy, it's catchy, but I think the guy's way, way more  talented than that record he put out.  But you, you, you gotta, we, we, we have been conditioned, like our children now, my children  are so much different than me.  Like my daughter now is, she's in school in DC, well, she's an intern and she just, she,  she sees a possibility in the world that I just never would have believed.  Like she sees things so much different than me.  And it's because, and my father sees something.  My father got mad at me one time. 
[02:44:00]  Um, there was, we were doing Studio 60 and John Goodman kept calling me, uh, Sammy.  Like it was obviously right, but it was my job.  And we go to a funeral for a friend of mine.  My father comes to me and he goes, why you let that white man talk to you like that?  I'm like, daddy, that's, it was in the script.  I'm like, what do you mean?  You got mad, huh?  I said, no, I didn't get mad.  He said, you made me so mad.  You letting him talk.  What I'm supposed to do?  Tell Aaron Sorkin to write that out?  Because my father ain't going to write that?  Yeah.  You need those wood floors to be polished and more scrapes. 
[02:44:30]  Right.  So it's just, it's a whole different thing now.  Yeah.  People believe.  Yeah.  Generation to generation.  Absolutely.  Right.  So.  You're right.  And just like, like, like, I, like now that I guess the Catholic church, I guess they  paid out $2 billion in, $2 billion.  Yep.  Bunch of cattle tales.  And, and, and, for sex to settle sex suits, wouldn't hookers and cocaine been a lot cheaper?  I mean, that's a lot of money, man. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  You buy a couple of holes.  And what's more disturbing is that they had $2 billion.  Right.  I'm giving my stupid change all these years in those dumb little, uh, baskets they pass  around.  But you know what's funny?  What the fuck, man?  Start spending some of that shit.  They had $2 billion in a dick-sucking slush fund.  How fucking devious is an organization when they have $2 billion?  Is it right?  That didn't even hurt.  They didn't even bat an eye after that.  $2 billion?  Settle.  Yeah.  Business as usual.  I thought some of these, uh, churches would have to close down or something. 
[02:45:30]  Nope.  Well, I guess some of the archdioces are saying, like, San Diego did it, LA.  It's funny, because if Michael Jackson was a priest instead of a singer, he'd have never  went, they'd just reassigned him to a new record label.  Oh, yeah.  You go to Tommy Boy.  They enter that over there.  But I, so to me, all of that shit is just hilarious that people get all worked up.  Yeah.  Like, Jesus showed up on a cheese toast, or Jesus was, like, Jesus is everywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Toast a tree, a window.  Chocolate.  Like, and chocolates. 
[02:46:00]  Like, remember Jesus beat everybody.  So this kind of stuff just always makes me.  And sells for $15,000 on eBay.  I saw the Virgin Mary in Santa Brains.  Yeah.  You sell it.  I like the crying statues myself.  And, like.  Big fan of the crying statues.  Everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  And, like, it's, it's like, I guess, uh.  There's too much humidity in the church.  That's all that is.  How come statues never shoot a load or take a gun?  Yeah, I mean.  Yeah.  They're in fucking depressing tears.  Crying blood.  If the mouth start moving and talking to me, then I'll, I'll be impressed. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, the archangel Gabriel has a fucking rod, and he's leaking clear stuff.  Call somebody.  What?  Watch your eyes.  Right.  Don't get, here's the holy goggles.  You don't want to go close to that guy.  I'm with you, man.  It's a hip and crying statue.  Woo.  And it's always something.  And it's always in, like, I was, I was doing, um.  Jay Leno with, with Mitt Romney.  Mm-hmm.  And Mormons, or Mitt Romney.  And they believed, in 1978, they believed it was a sin to be black, that we were, that 
[02:47:00]  we were cursed with the mark of Cain.  And there was no way a black guy could go to heaven.  And even if we did go, you had to be really good.  And then when you got to go, you went to heaven, you would still be slaves.  Wait, they believed that until 78?  78.  That's two years after the Jeffersons.  Wow.  Like, who gonna believe, until 1978.  God damn.  They must have hated Tom Willis.  Right.  No kidding.  And they believed that any, like, what kind of heaven, if you still, what's the incentive 
[02:47:30]  to be good, like, when you spend your whole life doing great and you still a limo driver  for Donnie and Marie for eternity, right?  Like, so, it's just, when I see all of this stuff, and that's 1978, so you're telling me  that all the people that, you know, all of a sudden got this edict in 1978 that what  they were thinking for all the years of the church was wrong, believe it?  Just like what, yeah.  Now they believe it, and all that other shit went away.  Right, right.  Right, right.  So he doesn't find out, does he?  Nah.  And it's not because they had a religious epiphanie, it's because they were gonna, the federal 
[02:48:00]  government was coming down on them, because they were, you know, they were...  Yeah, yeah.  And Brigham Young wasn't winning, you know, because you need niggas to run the ball.  You go on the pickers as you want, but you ain't got no black folk.  You ain't winning no games.  You know, Brigham Young ain't got a great jump shot.  So they changed the rules.  I'm just saying.  I'm on the Sharpton side now for attacking fucking Mitt Romney's stupid religion.  I'm on the side.  I wasn't at first, I'm like, fuck Sharpton, because I don't, I really, these are cunt.  But, in that case, he was right. 
[02:48:30]  Well, you know what, for a dude that's proud to be black, why does he wear the...  The hair of Aunt Bea from...  You can't have the hair and the body of a 60-year-old white woman.  He looks like Fred Flintstone.  And I remember when Civil Rights Leader was fit, like Martin Luther King marched from Selma,  Alabama to Washington, D.C.  Al ain't going to the...  If y'all ain't free by the corner, I'm gonna need to stop.  No, yeah.  I ain't sweating.  I'm up here for free.  Camera's off.  Get me a bus.  Hey, we gotta take a quick break.  So D.L. Hughley rejoining the show. 
[02:49:00]  What did you have to do, by the way?  I walked in on you.  I apologize.  A bunch of...  I wasn't naked and I didn't get naked.  I know, but I was...  I walked in on you.  It makes it sound like you're in a fucking airport bathroom.  You were in the middle of an intense...  You haven't even got nothing on me.  Watch this here.  You're in the middle of an intense conversation.  Actually, he wasn't.  He was making me fucking whacking off fucking sign.  Like, another one of these bullshit interviews.  Give me a show where I can do this shit.  This is wonderful.  How cool is that to curse?  First time cursing on the radio? 
[02:49:30]  Well, legally, the first time they didn't cut me off.  Usually gets screwed, man.  Satellite's fucking great.  You can just say whatever you want, content-wise.  No, you can't because you still got some spitting.  Well, you can't say certain things about certain public officials.  We had a homeless guy come in and he said, yeah, oh, it was just, what a treat that was.  It's like, well, if there's anywhere where there should be this last bastion of free speech 
[02:50:00]  and anyone can say anything, we understand the context of it.  It's a homeless guy.  He had been going off for 20 minutes about all kinds of crazy shit.  It was really funny.  The guy had a genuine sense of humor about him.  As most homeless people do.  Yeah.  I mean, you have to when you're sitting out on the street like that.  This guy had like a Richard Pryor thing.  He was funny, man.  Off the cuff.  Real funny.  Out of his fucking mind.  I'll stake that again.  And then, of course, if he was just funny, he'd have a career.  But he's also fucking crazy. 
[02:50:30]  So he's blurting out shit about Condoleezza Rice and the First Lady.  And we're laughing because of the prior 20 minutes that he had done is totally in context  with this lunacy that he's speaking, you know, now.  But I don't want to, you know, even now you made the distinction that you were laughing  at what happened.  Like, we just, shit that makes you laugh, you can't explain.  That's an invalidation.  Exactly.  Like, when Kramer from Seinfeld, when he went on that nigga rampage.  Right.  It was eight niggas in before the audience decided they were offended. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  And then they went, wait, he's over the nigger limit.  That is true.  They were laughing at first.  Otherwise, they'll think we hate them.  Because it's shocking to see Kramer saying that.  But then after a while, it became like, hey, wait a minute.  This motherfucker's like, really?  That may be your perspective of it.  And that may be an honest one.  But some people just thought it was funny.  After seven, you mean it.  Right.  That's what the rule is.  Is that the ruling?  And do you know the sales of Seinfeld went up 75% for the nigger? 
[02:51:30]  Of course it did.  So let's not pretend like that.  Controversy sells.  We all know that.  And the people pretend like they're more offended than they really are.  Like, it's because some dude that was the fourth banana on a hit show said, nigga, it's  supposed to be shocking to me.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Now I have to.  And then some people have to be told that they're supposed to be offended.  Right.  And then they're offended.  Like, I didn't.  I didn't even realize.  You're right.  Yeah.  Like, fuck him.  How does taking a show off the air that we didn't even like Don Imus? 
[02:52:00]  We didn't even.  How does taking a show off the air we didn't even know was on?  Yeah.  Help us.  Yeah.  It would have done.  Whatever.  I don't even know who it is.  Who's listening to Don Imus?  Now when he comes back, everybody will.  Yeah.  Reverend Al got to him to the point.  It would have done more good if he stayed on the air.  I don't think Rutgers female basketball team was listening to Don Imus.  Well, even if they were eating oats, those ugly horses.  You know who made it a big deal?  Very good. 
[02:52:30]  You know who made it a big deal?  I just don't find female basketball traits in general.  Rutgers are not very attractive.  I would fuck three of the Knicks before I'd fucking go check.  You can't have.  You can't look like three of the.  I saw a brat.  I'm like, is this brat wearing a cup?  If you can braid your own hair and palm a basketball, ain't nobody going to want to put you on Sports Illustrated.  And it's not even about hair.  If you're over six feet and you have a pussy, I don't want to fuck you.  Right, right.  It's just creepy. 
[02:53:00]  I don't like tall fucking muscles.  They're big, strong women.  Is that being Wallace?  No, that's Benita Wallace.  Jimmy, Anthony brings up a good point how you've got to be told that you're offended.  And who's responsible for that is the media.  They did a timeess and they did it with the Janet Jackson situation.  No, no, no.  People always blame the media for everything.  But the media, I'll tell you why.  We're the media right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I'll tell you why.  We're the dark side of it.  The I miss thing, it was just another show, a throwaway line.  Someone grabbed it and it got to the TV. 
[02:53:30]  And then they played it over and over and over again.  And that's what embarrassed the Rutgers women's basketball team.  And demand a response.  It was a slow, it was a bad joke on a slow news week.  That's all it was.  And you know what?  Here's the thing.  I just hosted Def Jam.  Now, when that comes on, and there were some very talented people and some people that,  you know, very talented people.  But the subject matter was all over the map.  When they see that, it's going to be hard for America to go, how can I take, you know, 
[02:54:00]  them being offended about this when they're not offended about that?  But all I'm saying is, if you don't dig something, really, honestly, I'm a grown man.  We're not pie pipers where you got to listen to me and you got to buy my album.  You know, if you don't like something, you have the power, like, you have the power to  say, I don't want to hear it.  And people subscribe to you.  You would think that would be good enough.  Fuck it.  You know, but for some reason, that's not.  And I don't get that and I'll never get that.  But there are people who have a vested interest in having victims. 
[02:54:30]  Like, if you're a victim, then I'm a hero.  Right, right.  I'm saving you.  Right.  You know, from this awful radio, whatever you got to listen to.  And people want to be relevant.  Like, I was watching Richard Pryor, his live thing, and Jesse Jackson was in the front.  Richard Pryor was niggating it up, but Jesse Jackson was in the front laughing.  Wait, wait, wait, what is that?  Is that live in concert?  One of them.  One of them.  I'm not sure which one of them was, but he's in the front row.  Does he point Jesse out?  I think he does point him out.  But I saw him in the audience. 
[02:55:00]  They saw a shot of him in the audience.  And he was niggating it up.  And I'm like, why is that different?  Because that's the dude you like?  Yeah, because that's the guy you like.  It's absolutely it.  When Dave Chappelle was doing what he was doing, wasn't that just as, you know, that  was just as edgy as the stuff you see now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you like him, so that's okay.  Yeah.  When Eddie Griffith gets kicked off stage for saying nigga, but if Richard Pryor came on  stage and was doing it, those same people would have thought that that was genius.  You think they'd pull Pryor off the stage?  No.  No.  So shut up with that bullshit. 
[02:55:30]  Shut up with your fucking pork chops on your face and telling me how great.  You know what?  I love the fact that Pryor introduced Huey P. Newton in a comedy.  Exactly.  How do you not fucking love that?  Ladies and gentlemen, Huey P. Newton, I remember that one, yeah.  And so I just, it's just.  We're going to change gears after the break.  We're going to talk about Once Upon a Potty or.  What?  Oh, we're going to do something different with D.  What is that?  Or we could do the, where's the poo thing?  Oh, man.  Oh.  You're really into shit humor today, are you? 
[02:56:00]  No, no.  Into a little scat.  Neither one of those.  Oh, here it is.  Clip from Poo Corner about not okay to touch or to be touched.  And this is by who?  Poo.  Winnie the?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's Winnie the Booth?  He just used his last name.  We're going to change gears.  We're going to do something a little different.  Because I don't trust a bear with a halter top on.  He's very gay.  With a pot of honey.  Who does that to you?  I mean, no poker balls visible.  Just give me the fucking creeps. 
[02:56:30]  What a bottom he must be.  We're going to get a halter top on.  We'll change gears.  We'll do something a little different next.  D.L. Hughley, HBO, this Saturday night at 10, right?  10 o'clock on HBO.  And the DVD, because HBO is smart, comes out Tuesday.  And there's DVD extras on it.  I guess bits that got cut or whatever it is.  I don't know what you did on your extras.  And we're hearing things about your special.  Hearing things.  Hearing things.  A few things.  Hearing things that are good.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Make sure you check it out on HBO.  I hear the language is a little foul.  Yeah.  A little salty.  A little saucy.  Yes. 
[02:57:00]  More with D.L. in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, boy.  Hey, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What?  I didn't see that one coming.  Opie and Anthony.  D.L. Hughley in the studio. 
[02:57:30]  We were just asking him about Patrice O'Neill.  He did Def Comedy Jam.  What, Saturday?  Sunday.  Sunday.  Sunday?  Saturday night.  And he kicked ass.  He kicked ass?  A lot of people are asking that.  He's hilarious.  We love him.  He's my favorite young.  I don't know how young.  Young?  Young.  How old are you?  44. 
[02:58:00]  He's 44?  Well, he's older than me.  He's 30, uh, 38.  He ain't wearing it well.  He better slow down.  He's awful.  That's what I just read.  You know that black people live seven years less than white people.  We live on average.  That's the average.  But we look good, though.  Some of y'all in that sun.  How old are you?  Six?  Damn.  Drink some lotion or something.  Jesus.  We were saying that about OJ.  The guy doesn't age.  Yeah, but he moves.  That's the average.  You know what it is?  He has a little grain of his hair.  That's about it.  He moves bad.  Yeah, he's all, his hips are gone. 
[02:58:30]  He moves, he moves, he moves bad.  If you look, you'll notice, like, if black people make it past a certain age, they live  to be 140 years old.  It's just that younger end of the curve is what's bringing the stats down.  That's where that seven years are coming from.  You get killed at 22.  Yeah, yeah.  That brings the average down.  Yeah, absolutely.  But, you know, once you reach a certain age, it's just like you got the white powdery hair  and the little beard.  You don't see a lot.  Like, I don't remember the last time I saw an old black dude. 
[02:59:00]  Really?  Nah, I can't remember.  Just one of those.  Let me tell you about, uh, 19 and, uh, it was 19 and 35.  No, huh?  Nope.  Don't see a lot.  Not in New York?  Nope.  I don't think.  I can't remember the last time.  Nah, I'm, you know, my grandma.  I'm trying to think of me when the last time I saw, they, they out of style.  They're out of style?  Out of style.  Hey, what the hell's happening out the window?  Like, but then.  Whoa, look at this.  Oh, these crazy window washers.  These guys are insane. 
[02:59:30]  You gotta be.  Oh, open up that window.  They don't scare the shit out of them.  And they want to stop immigration.  You can't get a white boy.  Who the hell are you getting in that basket?  You have the dirtiest windows with broccoli piling up.  It's not the white man that wants immigration stopped.  Are you fucking kidding me?  That is a sick job, man.  Or I should say the illegal.  Are you kidding me?  Fuck that up.  The law of averages just says that someday you're going to plummet to your death in that job.  The whole thing's shaking. 
[03:00:00]  And they're working hard.  They're really trying to clean these windows.  Yeah.  They give a shit.  Yeah.  Who would notice?  Right.  If I was cleaning the windows, you'd see one yellow streak trickling down.  What is that?  A tint?  They're going to be on our window next.  Here they come.  Who cares?  Let's hold jerk off looking at them.  Guess the nationality, everyone.  Hey, there we go.  Oh, no.  That one guy looks Russian, maybe.  That's Russian.  And then it's in Mexico. 
[03:00:30]  That ain't fucking Russian.  You don't think the middle guy's Russian?  Get a sign up and ask him.  Ask him.  Write a sign.  Are you Russian?  Say, Privia.  Privia.  The middle guy looks like, wait, no, no, no, no, you're right.  He's Colombian.  Once they clear the film up, you can tell.  Yeah, you're right.  There's too much soap on the window.  How about this?  Somebody flash a badge and see which one jumps.  La migra!  Look at these guys.  They're not even phased, man.  And he's leaning out of the face. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, my God.  It's insane, man.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Fuck that.  Oh, man, shit.  Is he leaning out?  Yeah, he's leaning out.  He don't give a shit.  He's not even phased, this guy.  Look at him.  He's got his Yankee cap on.  He's just great.  He's just bored cleaning windows.  And, like, there's nothing to it.  Nothing, man.  No, they don't care that they're way up.  You know how fucked up it must be?  It's rocket.  I would be in the fetal position crying for mommy.  Do you know how fucked up it must be where they're from?  That this ain't shit to you?  Right.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, where are they coming from?  Like, I've never been to Cuba, but that's got to be it.  Cubans would leave Cuba without a boat.  I'm leaving today.  Yeah.  I saw 6,600 Cubans floating on the Haitian, dude.  Who's in charge of the apparatus that lowers this thing?  Do you know when this dude is leaning out of it?  In China, they lower them.  They're on seats.  You ever see guys just do it?  They're like, on seats.  They're free hanging on, like, seats.  Oh, no.  They are just lowered by two ropes.  Wow.  Yeah, I've seen that.  It's like Thailand or China. 
[03:02:00]  I mean, they're doing real high rises.  And the guy's got the blue Yankee.  He got it going, too.  The blue Yankee baseball cap.  Oh, the Chinese, they, it's lead and everything they give us, huh?  Look how easy he makes that.  Yeah.  The Chinese are giving us lead everything.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  I think it's fairly obvious they're trying to kill us.  Yep.  They found a way out with no bombs, no bullets, no armies.  Hey, you missed the spot.  They're killing us with lead everything.  Because we don't make nothing no more.  Everything.  Yeah.  And we get mad.  I heard that well over 65% of the toys from Mattel come from China. 
[03:02:30]  Yep.  And then the other, whatever, percent, 45 or 35?  Carry the one.  Carry the one.  That's why I'm in radio.  Is from other countries.  You know, it's not made in the United States.  We don't make anything anymore.  Except shitty superstars like Sanjaya.  That's what we make.  That's what we're exporting.  We got that.  Sanjaya.  The gay Gandhi.  We got him.  Yeah, what the hell happened?  I don't know.  We got people demanding too much cash. 
[03:03:00]  Is that it?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  We used to make shit.  We used to make shit for somewhere else.  There used to be, I remember seeing films, black and white films that just smoke stacks billowing  shit out and assembly lines pumping all kinds of crap out.  Yeah, if we don't make anything, how come our environment's so fucked up?  You know what I mean?  I think we're all pollution free here in the United States now.  And job free.  And job free.  And China's pumping that fucking coal into plants that are running factories with children  painting lead paint all over kids' toys. 
[03:03:30]  But let me, you gotta consider, like if you have six-year-olds making fucking toys, I don't  think they're the best inspectors.  Oh, you don't, yeah, they don't care.  That's just it.  But that's another big hypocritical part of this fucking country, man.  We will sit there and condemn other countries about being, you know, the axis of evil and  this guy's trying to build a nuke and that one.  But we look at China because we have trade with them and they own so many of our dollars.  They own our national debt. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, they own our debt that we won't call them out on the fact that they got children  work in there.  They fucking, they're shooting people that are blogging.  They got eight billion of them.  Eight billion.  So it's like, fuck a couple of the kids.  Who cares?  A few piles of them.  Fuck it.  They're executing people that blog, that go on the web and start blogging.  Yeah.  I love them.  Oh, you don't like what they hear?  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  Jimmy's not a fan of the blogger.  We'd love to start executing some message board people ourselves.  Can I call you back?  I'm busy blogging. 
[03:04:30]  Can you speak Chinese?  Look out, bitch.  It's coming.  And then they have, but they sure know they got an iron fist over there because they have  national no drive day.  What?  And this is, they're going to take a day in China where no one fucking drives.  And now if they did that here, exactly.  It would be no drive day and they'd be like, you know, one guy riding his bicycle to fucking  work.  Do you know if they see one car on the road, that thing is getting hand grenaded over  there.  It's like, they don't take shit. 
[03:05:00]  It's not one of these voluntary.  Hey, why don't we do the country a favor and not drive?  It's don't you fucking drive today.  Why are they doing that?  I don't know how to help out with the environment, the environment of fuel.  I think it's then you're making their lead toys.  Actually, I think it's so the government can have more fuel aside from the people and  they can do what they do.  They're very like, and I guess, what is, you can only have one kid or something?  One kid.  And they're starting to crack down on that rule too.  There's going to be big penalties.  In the rural provinces, the gig is if you don't have them, everybody wants a boy. 
[03:05:30]  So if it ain't a boy, they're doing all kinds of crazy shit.  And we know what's going on and we don't, we don't.  Yeah, no one says anything.  We're still friends with them, shaking hands, trading.  Why don't we have a Walmart if we didn't have Chinese anymore?  That's it.  Yeah.  It's amazing that we send people over there to shake hands with their diplomats and no  one brings up the fact that they're just massacring people over there.  Yeah, but fuck it.  Ah, whatever.  I don't care.  It's way over there. 
[03:06:00]  It's a raid.  It's too far away.  I don't care.  It just kind of hurts that they own all our money.  Hey, speaking of way over there.  I don't think you're rid of enough of them.  Speaking of way over there.  Just print up new shit and say that theirs is all bad now.  Keep it.  Keep it.  It's nothing.  Speaking of way over there, the plane crash.  Talent?  Yeah, but what Anthony was saying this morning was really interesting.  Oh, yeah.  They're interviewing the people seconds after they left the flaming wreck.  Well, now with the availability of cell phones with the cameras on them and just people with 
[03:06:30]  very small camcorders, plane crashes now are shit that you used to see, maybe a shoe in  a tree.  You'd see the wreckage the next day with the inspectors.  Still smoldering a little bit.  Maybe.  Not even.  Like, just the inspectors going through shit.  Right.  Now-  Black box, you'd hear that.  Yeah, you'd hear that recording and go, oh, that's fucked up.  Now, just last night, I'm on YouTube or break or whatever it was, and I'm watching a video  of some motherfucker with a cell phone camera as people are walking out of a crashed fucking 
[03:07:00]  jetliner all fucked up.  And you're going, this is shit we never used to see.  Yeah, but who's the asshole that's like-  That's taping it.  I want to, you know, if I'm going to be incinerated, I want to-  The guy didn't care.  I guess he was backed by the runway enough.  He's taping.  And one guy came up, and he's running his hands through his hair, and he's looking  back over his shoulder.  He obviously came from the wreck, and he's almost smiling.  Like, he's looking like, giving that, holy shit, kind of, I don't believe I was just in 
[03:07:30]  a fucking plane crash.  Right, right.  And then they brought over this other guy that was all fucked up, bloody.  They make him sit on the runway.  But this is the shit you never saw.  And now, we are seeing everything.  There's nothing you really can't see anymore.  You want to see somebody get his head sawn off, it's there now.  And that shit, I don't know if that's so good.  You know why I think it's good, actually?  Because I think that we live in a society where we do one thing and say it not. 
[03:08:00]  I think we should actually have to see the bullshit we do.  I really do.  I think that we want war, and we want to tell everybody how great war is, and that kind of  bullshit.  People should see it.  Like, because now we-  Yeah, because they did a great job over the years hiding war from us, for the most part.  You would get one-  Yeah, we'd get films and stuff.  You would get like a Dan Rather or somebody in the field.  But was he-  He was-  Now it's-  I mean, you go to break, you pop in Iraq War, you're looking at IEDs going off. 
[03:08:30]  You know that there are more amputees in this war than at any other time since the Civil  War.  More amputees in this particular war.  There are like 35,000 people, severely injured people.  If they were, if our medical technology wasn't as good as it is, we'd have like 40,000 people  dead.  Yeah, it is saying something about the medical technology on the field.  Like, because the force is so bad in some of these IEDs, they've shown cases where the  brain has spun around in the cranium.  And these are the people we keep alive, and they're coming back. 
[03:09:00]  Now, of course, when they get here, we ain't going to take care of them or nothing like  that.  But that's the kind of thing that you do for, like, we should actually have to see  the shit that go, that we do, that we see.  We should have to see it.  And if we saw it, I think that, like, I don't know how seriously to take a group that gets  outraged over, you know, Michael Vick not going to jail when Scooter Libby, who was convicted,  and that's too hard.  Like, Republicans always want people to go to jail until it's one of them.  And then that's too hard.  She's too short to go to jail.  They'll fuck him.  And when your name is Scooby, you better get ready to suck a lot of dick and watch him 
[03:09:30]  suck.  Scooter Libby, because your mouth is going to be working.  You better do that.  But it's just all, it's so, you know, it's so, like, that's just so hilarious to me that  they, you know, the things that people get all worked about.  You don't get worked up about, you know, he got, like, everybody's talking about how  OJ should have been convicted and all that kind of shit, which, you know, I admit that  years ago, I didn't think he did it.  And then when I started reading and shit, I was like, this motherfucker, wow. 
[03:10:00]  Not only is it like, I think he did it, it's like, oh, she so fucking did this.  But, and let me tell you, Michael Vick at least admitted he did it.  And you can't get a brother to admit shit.  You could have DNA, you could have AAA.  Did you see me, motherfucker, and I didn't do it.  But Michael Vick taught me, people with shit to lose can't hang out with motherfuckers  who don't got shit to lose.  Yeah.  People should stick to their own car, because people who don't got shit to lose will lose  your shit for you. 
[03:10:30]  Do you have a lawyer?  No, but I have some information for the DA.  Exactly.  And then you're going.  Hey, we got to get this guy in the line.  Damn.  Jim from North Carolina disagrees with everything DL is saying today.  Everything?  Everything.  He's from North Carolina.  Oh, no, I'm a river now.  I'm born and raised in Seattle, so don't go that route, DL.  But, you know, you're hypocritical.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I can't hear you.  Wait, slow down.  You're hypocritical.  Okay.  I saw you on the Bill Maher show, and you were really against, you were totally for Sharpton 
[03:11:00]  and what he did to Imus, and now you're sitting in front of these guys.  You are lying.  I haven't been on Bill Maher since Imus was on.  You're lying.  I have not been on Bill Maher since Imus was on.  Not one time.  DL and your ass on HBO, you're slamming Imus, too.  Because you're sitting in front of these guys.  You're lying.  I didn't slam down.  You're lying.  I saw the commercial last night.  Ty Winning, I'm coaching Notre Dame.  They didn't get fired when he was 10 and 2.  Go look it up on ESPN.com. 
[03:11:30]  Because you got a freaking microphone in front of you, you think you can say anything you  want?  Now I'm supposed to believe you 35,000 amputees?  You're full of shit.  You're full of shit.  Okay.  And you know what's awesome?  Well, let me say two things.  One, because I have a microphone in front of me, I can say what I want.  You have the right to not dig it.  And, of course, I'm full of shit.  I'm American.  And that's an American right.  And if you say that I've been on Bill Maher, if you can lie out of the side of your neck 
[03:12:00]  and say that I was on Bill Maher and defend it, I haven't been on Bill Maher since the  Don Imus thing happened.  So, what the fuck are you talking about?  Honestly.  How did you get the information that Ty Winning was 10 and 2 when he got fired?  I read it.  Well, that's wrong.  That's wrong.  He got fired with a losing record.  And the white coach before he got fired, and the white coach before that, he got fired.  Yeah, but here's the difference.  They didn't give Ty Willingham a 10-year contract extension like they gave Charlie Weiss, a huge 
[03:12:30]  contract extension, for not doing shit.  He's a shitty coach on a shitty team.  And if he was a black guy, he'd have got fired early.  That's the deal, and you know it.  That's great.  But one of the two white guys who got fired before him, because they suck.  I disagree.  No, no.  There was a white guy who got fired because he lied about his credentials and got fired.  That's why Ty...  The only reason Ty Willingham got the job was because there was a white guy who lied about  being his credentials, and then they hired...  Oh, we better hire the nigger.  Yeah, again, you don't know what you're talking about. 
[03:13:00]  Bob Davey, after Lou Holtz, got fired.  Before Lou Holtz, Jerry Fowlce got fired.  The guy O'Leary...  Okay, let me ask you something.  Jerry Fowlce and Bob Davey got fired after a couple of years, after three years, right?  Ty Willingham got fired for three years.  You don't have to work it out.  Ty Willingham got fired after the second year he was going to get fired.  No, you just don't have...  Okay, but here's the point.  How exactly am I being hypocritical?  Because what you said, with a darn honest thing, for sure, I watched your... 
[03:13:30]  You're lying.  Let me tell you something.  I will give you $1,000 if you saw me on Bill Maher defending Don Imus.  I don't need you to give him $1,000.  I watched the commercial last night on HBO.  Wait, wait, no, no, no, wait.  You said I was on Bill Maher defending Don Imus.  No, attacking Imus, defending Sharpton, I think.  Oh, attacking Imus, defending Sharpton.  That's a lie.  Why do you think I'm being protested by him?  I'm not a fucking hypocrite.  I'm not a coward.  Now, if I get my information...  If I get my information wrong, you know, then pardon me. 
[03:14:00]  I'm sorry.  Even if the president can get a war wrong, I can get a fucking stat wrong.  I'll give you that.  Maybe it's a critical deal.  Maybe you're just shit.  Maybe I'm what?  Maybe you're supposed to shit.  You don't have the statistics to back up your comments.  Well, here's what I do have.  I know that I say what I believe.  I know that if Charlie Weiss were black, he'd be fired already.  I believe it.  I believe that what Don Imus said was insignificant, and I said that. 
[03:14:30]  And I believe that if you can prove that I defended Al Sharpton on any level, anywhere, I'll do whatever you want.  Now, I'm sure you would approve of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson when they hammered Notre Dame about giving the job to Ty Warham.  I'm sure you supported him on that.  I don't even know that they...  I don't even know anything about that.  Man, I'm not the dude that they roll out to defend anybody.  If you...  Like, I'm not the black guy they roll out when they want to defend somebody. 
[03:15:00]  Obviously, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  You really don't.  You know what I think is amazing?  You're really funny, and I think it's funny.  Man, I watched your show years ago.  No, no, you don't...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Here's...  We can't...  We can debate a lot of things.  I'm a funny motherfucker.  And that's one stat I know for sure.  I said you're funny, but it's amazing to me.  Well, thank you.  By the way...  By the way, our listeners are really good at research.  Reading from Whackbag, DL was on Bill Maher, March 30th, 2007. 
[03:15:30]  Right.  And Imus had nappy-headed hoes.  If they want to fucking dump out, then fucking dump out.  Right.  On the April 4th edition.  Right, thank you.  Of the Imus in the Morning Show.  So, anybody who ever says...  It's close, though.  No, it's not even close.  Yeah, did you know something before...  You know something?  Wait a minute.  Well, you know who's funny?  Like, if Imus...  If Imus...  Like, I think what he's doing to General Louisiana is notable.  I really do.  I think that that's cool.  But I think that when you have such bullshit fights that by the time you get to have a real 
[03:16:00]  one, people...  It's crying wolf.  So, anybody who says that I defend...  I would defend anybody I believe in, regardless of what the fuck anybody thought about it.  If I thought he was doing the right thing, I would be right on about it.  I'm not sitting up here trying to curry favor with anybody.  I do what the fuck I want.  If people dig me or not.  If I get a statistic wrong, I just read that on the internet, which, you know, they can't  be wrong.  But there are more amputees in this war than at any other time in our history.  My question to this guy...  Let's look that up. 
[03:16:30]  Reading, look that up for us on the internet.  Look that up more.  Simply because this guy...  I wish he was still on the line because I want to know, real simple, how do you say  you saw him on Bill Maher attacking Imus when...  It's like, look, I'll say it.  You were one of the few black performers that came out and did not attack Imus.  Yeah, we played what you said on Leno many times in this show.  And attacked the nonsense of taking what he said to you seriously.  So that guy just absolutely lied.  So anything he said after that to me was moot.  I was like, wait a minute.  When you saw... 
[03:17:00]  I saw you on Bill Maher.  It wasn't an impossibility.  See, that's exactly how black dudes go to jail.  It was him, your honor.  It was that guy.  I saw him with my own two eyes.  I wonder if he's mixing you up with some...  Who's on...  See if you can get, like...  Oh, Eric's looking right now.  See who...  I'm like, God damn.  He's thinking of somebody else.  Yeah, right?  But you guys all look the same.  Let's be honest.  Right.  Yeah, that must be it.  What's the difference between DL and Ben Vereen?  Ben Vereen.  Here's the thing.  It's a compliment if a Kenkel was on.  Making us look stupid. 
[03:17:30]  Come on.  Give us that one at least.  It's bad news if it was Steve Harvey.  It better not be JJ.  Right.  I'm like, wow, you know, like...  Jim, I didn't mean to hang up on you, by the way.  We don't do that on this show.  Right.  I mean, make your final point, though, okay?  I want to ask you a question.  Just honestly, like...  Hold on, Jim.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Jim.  You don't like DL, whatever.  But how come you could say that he was attacking Imus?  You're lying through your teeth.  A, he wasn't on Bill Maher after Imus.  And B, he was one of the few black performers that defended Imus' right to say that. 
[03:18:00]  So how could you say that?  I made a mistake.  I thought he was on Bill Maher.  Okay, but when you make a mistake, when you make a mistake, you're wrong.  When I make a mistake, I'm a hypocrite.  You're a hypocrite.  Yeah, yeah, no.  Okay, I'll give you that.  I was wrong.  No, you didn't have to give it.  We took it.  We took it.  Yeah, you're wrong.  I tried.  Okay, fine.  Why do you ascribe some kind of sinister motivation to me?  Like, he's trying to subvert us.  I think he makes a good point with the amputee thing because of, you know, the medicine we 
[03:18:30]  have nowadays.  Most of these guys would have bled out back then.  And a lot of the injuries are, like, ridiculous arm injuries.  So what is your point, Jim?  I'm trying to...  35,000 seems a little high, though, to be honest with you.  I'm telling you.  That's what they say.  I would say injured, there's probably...  No, not injured.  Amputees.  No, no.  Oh, you said injured?  I said injured.  All right, I'm sorry.  I said there are more amputees in this war than in any other war in our history except the  Civil War.  That's what I said.  There are 35,000 injured.  I apologize now.  You might have said amputees, but if you said it was accidental...  But I'm sorry.  I wasn't trying to subvert. 
[03:19:00]  35,000 injured and more amputees since the Civil War.  Since the Civil War.  Gotcha.  All right.  Now, what were you saying, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm sure you're really a phenomenal comic and you're really original.  What's not original is for you to sit on this radio show for three hours and only, as  a black comedian, only talk about race.  That is...  That is...  That's us, too, Jim.  That's us, too.  We're enjoying a racial discussion with us.  I was just going to say that to you.  It's like, it just seems exhausting being a black man.  Right. 
[03:19:30]  It is.  You can't just hang out and fucking, like...  Jim, will you hold on?  Jesus, dude.  Stop talking.  There's always got to be some race shit.  I also did talk about the Catholic Church for a minute.  Well, and...  Yeah, and how there's no black priests.  Right.  I talked about that.  Before the break, I was trying to, you know, change the subject.  I was going to go into the fucking, you know, Once Upon a Party stuff.  I don't even mean this show.  I just mean everything.  I'm not trying to be an asshole, really.  But I really don't give a fuck what you think.  I'm proud of this show.  I just...  There you go. 
[03:20:00]  I want to, but I can't.  You know what?  We're all having...  I like having a racial discussion with a black guy, because most people don't.  Most people are just phony when somebody else is around.  So I think it's fun to do and refreshing.  And so we're engaging in it, too.  There's a bunch of people in the room.  Deal's not just...  I'm not going, so who saw the Sopranos?  And he's yelling, black people!  It's like, we're all talking about it.  You fucking dumbbell with an agenda.  Fuck you, Jim.  All right, let's go to Dave in Montana.  He got a guinea on the couch.  He ain't said two fucking words.  Of course not.  Nobody even knows he's in this state. 
[03:20:30]  Trust me, he wants to say a lot.  Oh, boy, is he holding back.  That fucking Jim really annoyed me.  I've never seen more discipline from an Italian guy in my life.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, DL's exactly right about that.  Since the Civil War, the amputees, there's a great documentary on Saturday on HBO.  James Gandolfini was...  That's what I thought.  ...a bunch of amputees.  Right.  It was an awesome show, and he's exactly right.  So why...  Thank you, man. 
[03:21:00]  I'm not...  Do you remember the number?  11.  It was...  There was a real big drop-off after the Civil War.  Right.  Yeah, 35,000, I'm not sure about.  Maybe it was 30...  Whatever it was.  Okay.  Yeah, we're trying to find out.  Let's Google it.  I wasn't saying there are 35,000 amputees.  I was saying there are more amputees.  Well, yeah, I knew I got it from somewhere.  All right.  Also, a lot of these guys, these poor guys, man, they're in these vehicles that leave their  upper halves exposed. 
[03:21:30]  The gunners are sticking out.  Right.  The drivers, it's their left side, the passengers, their right side.  So when these explosives go off, they have so much exposed area that limbs go flying.  Right.  It's the sorry state of this war.  And even when you...  Like, people are all, you know, betrayers.  I mean, I guess MoveOn.org1 ran this commercial, and people were very upset about that.  You know, I guess, calling him a general, as if a general couldn't possibly lie.  Like, that couldn't happen. 
[03:22:00]  No, no.  But I'm not saying whether he lied or not, because I don't want...  Let me get this right.  But I think that he made similar comments in 2004 as he made in 2007.  So, you know, about the war going well and the training was going well.  Now he gets in front of you and says the exact same thing again, or a variation of it.  And I'm supposed to just automatically believe you.  So it's not that I...  I don't really...  The way that I view the world is from my perspective.  I happen to be a black man.  That's not what I hang my hat on.  But I'm just saying that the way that I see the world is distinctly different from the  way you do.  Sure.  I don't... 
[03:22:30]  I'm not making no...  I don't...  You know...  I don't know what to say.  I don't want to apologize.  There shouldn't be any excuses at all.  That's...  That's open and honest.  Right.  That's exactly...  And anybody can only see the world from their own perspective.  How the fuck is anybody else going to see it?  It's always like when you say something, people are going, you're a hypocrite.  Hypocrite.  How the fuck do we get to that?  I'm a hypocrite?  Because this is how I see it and how I feel about it.  Right.  Go fuck yourself.  I can only be hypocritical if I said something and then did something different.  Right. 
[03:23:00]  Like, what the fuck is that?  I mean, you defended down on...  I feel...  You defended Al Sharpton.  Oh, okay.  I feel sorry for you, actually.  You're missing...  Me too.  Yeah, he's missing some great Van Halen songs.  You know, going back.  Jesus.  I mean, God, not one?  I knew jump.  My God.  But that was sampled on a brother's record.  Okay.  Panama.  You might have heard Panama.  Panama.  Come on.  Okay.  Well, listen.  I still can't get mad at the fact that he doesn't know Van Halen.  Wait a minute.  Did you know the OJs?  See?  I really did not know that song. 
[03:23:30]  See?  I've been on radio a long time, and I know a little bit about everything on radio.  You and Jim from North Carolina need to get together.  You sons of bitches.  I've heard of the OJs, but I couldn't tell you what song they sang.  See?  Now I can say Stairway to Heaven.  Right.  And Brandy?  I know who she is.  I never heard of her.  Brandy was a song.  No, I'm talking about OJs.  No, I know.  A song called Brandy.  That's what I...  Which was about...  Brandy?  Isn't Brandy a pop singer?  What's the most popular OJ song?  Probably Brandy.  All right.  Let's go over to a little Brandy.  Probably Brandy.  There goes E-Rock blowing the dust off of it. 
[03:24:00]  It's going to really be kind of a trippy.  How the fuck y'all get it that fast?  It's E-Rock.  You just think something and it happens.  Goddamn computers.  Unless it's weight loss.  Sorry, Eric.  I apologize.  No offense.  That's okay.  No disrespect.  Don't worry about it.  Of course, all the OJ songs have this huge, long interlude.  Yeah.  You could go do shit while they wait for the phone to roll up.  It's like these guys would go off and fucking do a line while the band was one up and come  back and sing.  This is how you clean the house, the music.  Like, let me start the vacuum cleaner. 
[03:24:30]  They're just not ready to sing yet.  In time.  Okay, now we got a bunch of people saying Love Train has got to be their biggest hit.  Yeah, Love Train.  Oh, Love Train.  OJ, Brandy's my favorite.  Yeah.  I know Love Train is.  You don't even have to play that.  I do know that one.  That's like hack OJ stuff.  Yeah.  We used to call it beginner.  We're on an open fireplace in my favorite dungarees.  I almost thought this sucked and I realized D.L. is singing too.  Wow.  I didn't realize you were singing.  I'm like, this is shit. 
[03:25:00]  Okay, y'all missing the hook, man.  But my feet got in the way.  Stumbled to the floor.  She was right in the door.  I could see her face.  This is it.  I really don't know.  But how could it be?  She ran away from me.  My best friend's gone.  I'm so all alone.  I kind of miss you.  Brandy is about a dog. 
[03:25:30]  I like the looking glass version better.  See, that's about a dog.  And we used to slow dance to that shit.  Thinking it was a love song.  Get the fuck out of here.  We didn't even know it's about a dog.  So, you know, we playing it.  Michael Vick, this is going out to you, baby.  Black people love dogs.  Just the whole day.  But that was it.  We got our own branding from Looking Glass.  Really?  Let me hear that one.  This cultural exchange.  Yeah, the same song titles.  I think it's Looking Glass, if I'm not mistaken.  Wow, if that is. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, one hit wonder from Looking Glass.  But you know, like, the Isley Brothers.  Everybody knows that.  Yeah, we know the Isley Brothers.  Sure.  But it's just like the Terrence Trent Darby.  Here we go.  Yeah, but that is.  It's got a little soul to it.  That's funky.  Well, because it's the 70s.  Might even be a black band.  Everything sounded like this.  Oh, no, this ain't a black band.  This is our brandy.  That sounds like a black guy.  That's got to be it, brother.  That's a black guy. 
[03:26:30]  He sold out, though.  Yeah, he did.  He made music for the white man.  That's not loud.  No, that ain't a white man.  That ain't a brother.  That's a brother, right?  Is this a real thing?  Are you fucking around?  No, this was a huge hit back in...  You might know the chorus.  1972.  I've never heard this.  You've never heard this?  No. 
[03:27:00]  I've never heard this.  I guarantee you'll download this fucker tonight.  Gets under your skin.  I know.  I think it's about some bitch...  Isn't it about some bitch that works at a bar or something  where all the boats come in  and, like, the guy's all fucker or something?  Is that a song about a hoe?  I think so.  There's an article on the O's about a hoe.  I don't know.  That's my favorite song.  I've never heard that.  I'll tell you what song I did hear growing up  that I really love.  What is that? 
[03:27:30]  House of the Rising Sun?  Oh, yeah.  See, I knew that.  Was that the song growing up you heard?  I'm sure, like, white people have it, too,  but black guys always have a couple of white songs  they really love,  but you've got to kind of keep it under your hat.  But ours, like, the black people,  we really...  The white people, we really love.  Hall and Oates, big for us.  Hall and Oates was big for black people.  Why?  Elton John, big for us.  All right, Elton John.  You know, like, Benny and the Jets,  we all knew...  You only like gay white people.  They weren't threatening.  How could they not be?  How'd they have to be?  I never thought about that.  We like Hall and Oates. 
[03:28:00]  Chuck Mangione.  Hall and Oates is very soulful.  Yeah, we like...  The fruits.  We like the VG.  What do we do wrong?  What do we do wrong?  Hey, Ray, Ray, you know all of them from.  Why do you call him Red?  I can't believe that you were saying it wasn't real.  Wait, get in there.  Now, Brandy was a big song for us, right?  Yes.  Now, do I know...  Like, if I knew he was following you around,  I wouldn't have said half the shit I said today on the radio.  Are you crazy?  You don't think D.L. can't kick your ass?  But he knows all of it.  At least I feel like it might be. 
[03:28:30]  Who's the guy...  What's that song I really like that I didn't know white people sung that I was telling you?  I don't know.  When were you talking?  We were on a car...  We were in the thing this morning.  Pennsylvania Polka?  Oh, by the way, they sing Brandy, so that...  Oh, okay.  White guy with a beard.  Yeah, that's the 70s.  Who was that?  Show me the OJs.  No, this is any band that has crashed in a plane in the 70s.  Holy...  I like Lynyrd Skynyrd.  There you go.  That's Looking Glass.  There's no black dudes there.  Yeah, Looking Glass.  Hey, by the way, House of the Rising Sun was the song I heard the first time I was in a strip club. 
[03:29:00]  That's why I got memories.  Yeah, for House of the Rising Sun.  Like, he's the...  You know, the Eagles did an acoustic version of that that's out of sight.  He's the...  Yeah, the Eagles, yeah.  He's the most thuggish-looking encyclopedia.  Thuggish-looking nerd.  I'm just going to agree with everything he has to say.  Like, the Eagles wrote a version of that that was spectacular.  It was minted in 1947.  And now I'm going to choke you out.  Wait, what was the song you were going to tell us the song you liked? 
[03:29:30]  It was a song that we were talking about today that I didn't know that White Cats had sung,  and you had it on your iPod.  Like, because him and my publicist have all, like, weird shit on the app.  Like, you'll see, uh, fucking...  You should see what Jimmy has.  I have fucking...  Betty Davis eyes.  I have fucking Jenny from the block.  I do.  I don't care.  That's cool.  I like it.  That's fantastic.  I don't want to like it.  I fucking went and grabbed Akon.  That's stupid.  Well, you know, you're sorry.  I fucking can't stop it.  You know what it is?  What's that song?  Hey, baby. 
[03:30:00]  Hey, baby.  That song, what is his name?  No doubt.  No doubt.  Oh, hey, baby.  No, no, no, it's the song.  It's a rap.  A Cat Named Hurricane.  Like, I remember, like, Parliament Funky Delic was our...  Like, that was...  But you guys love them, too, right?  A little bit, a little bit.  Boss loves them.  I don't know what they're saying.  Yeah.  Not much of a crossover, but a little bit, a little bit.  What about Brother Johnson?  That was a little too funky for me.  Brother Johnson?  Brother Johnson?  No.  No.  No.  I never really went further than Sly and the Family Stone, you know?  Yeah, but that's rock, though.  Yeah, but that was...  Yeah, but... 
[03:30:30]  That's real rocky, yo.  That shit got funky, but not as funky as...  But you like Rick James, right?  Oh, yeah.  Who doesn't like Rick?  Fuck yeah.  I just like his lifestyle.  We like his...  Yeah, we like his stories.  Fucking rape in a crack pipe.  Burning bitches with crack pipe balls.  Fantastic.  You don't like my song?  Straighten up, whore.  What about Bootsy Collins?  You like him, right?  Bootsy, yeah.  He's a little bit strange.  I don't know what he's saying.  Bootsy Collins?  Well, I know the shit from the commercials, right? 
[03:31:00]  He did all the commercials, right?  Bootsy?  Help me out.  What are you saying?  Dude, you are like...  What?  Bootsy Collins to you is like Van Halen.  You know what I'm saying?  And he gets like, oh, you gotta know Van Halen if you don't know him.  Bootsy, the guy that sings the...  The Lincoln commercials, right?  That's Bootsy.  That's what I mean.  I know him from the commercials.  Yeah.  I couldn't tell you a song he sang before that.  Now, see, we...  See, like Groove is in the heart.  What?  Oh, he was in D-Light?  Groove is in the heart?  Oh, Groove is in the heart.  That could be it.  Oh, okay. 
[03:31:30]  That's how I know.  The worst song.  Sure.  Really?  No.  I know that song.  It is so funny to me.  Did he have a career before that?  Yeah.  Like Ray Parker Jr.  He sang Ghostbusters, right?  Did he have a career before that?  Yeah, absolutely.  He did.  I swear to God, I have no clue.  You know, it was like...  I like shit like Shalimar and the Commodores.  That's the shit I grew up with.  Commodores, I have no problem with.  Right, right, right.  But after Lionel Richie left, they were just singing Grad Night at... 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, it was over.  Grad Night.  Night Shift.  That was all they sang.  But the music was really just...  So when Bootsy does something with D-Light, you guys are like, oh, man, you're selling out?  No.  At that point?  No, no, it was just...  No, it was just like...  That's like when I...  When...  When...  Who did a collaborator?  Elton John and Michael Jackson?  Oh, shit.  No, Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson.  McCartney and Jackson.  Ugh.  Both sides could agree.  Oh, that's awful.  That's something that brought black and white people together.  Hey, man.  You guys...  I like that fucking song.  You like that Ebony and Ivory? 
[03:32:30]  Ebony and Ivory.  That was fucking terrible.  What was the other one they did we make fun of?  Oh, where they play the two guys selling elixir in town?  Yeah, right.  Where Paul is fucking all the one-legged girls.  Is that say, say, say, say?  Say, say, say is our best song.  Fucking the one-legged girls.  Say, say.  I like that shit.  Are you like that, buddy?  Oh, you hated it.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm gay, gay, gay.  Fucking guys sung yesterday.  Look, I...  What the fuck?  You're not gay unless you're sucking dick while you listen to the song.  I happen to like that fucking song. 
[03:33:00]  God damn.  Is this it?  This is the shit right here.  Oh, God.  They're on the back of a pickup truck selling elixirs.  Yeah, they're on the back of a pickup truck selling elixirs.  Yeah.  And you know what's funny?  Pussy with Paul has always been cool now.  It's the shit that you like that you're afraid to...  Oh, fuck yeah.  We talk about that all the time.  You're right.  We got to...  My family, we had a Burl Ives Christmas album.  Oh, shit.  Burl Ives.  That I used to think was the shit.  I hope you were a kid.  Yeah, I was a kid.  You had to listen to... 
[03:33:30]  Like, you had to listen to what my mother never listened to.  Like, we had one TV, so you watched what they was watching.  Yeah, yeah.  Every black person knows something about General Hospital.  I'm not saying you liked it.  I'm just saying you knew who the fuck Luke and Laura was.  Dude, he's right, man.  I mean, our Christmas songs were Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, all the old school stuff, because  that's when my dad broke down every Christmas.  Andy Williams.  I know all that shit.  Andy Williams, yeah.  Like, I heard all that.  Pat Boone, that type of shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My mother used to love Engelbert Humperdinck.  Oh, my God.  She thought he was the shit. 
[03:34:00]  Because, like, when you was growing up, there was no black dudes on TV, so you had to pick  the next guy.  Yeah.  He could be Creole.  Hey, we gave you Sticks.  Sticks on, where was he?  What show?  See?  Oh, what?  Happy Days?  Was he the drummer on Happy Days?  The black drummer on Happy Days?  He was in one episode.  One episode.  Sticks.  What was the black dude on Welcome Back, Connor?  Oh, Freddie Boom Boom Washington.  Lawrence Hilton Jacobs.  Yeah.  I remember on, like, Love, what was that, Love Boat? 
[03:34:30]  Love Boat.  Every time a black woman was coming on, you knew Isaac was getting some pussy.  He would have the right, he used to wear the white jacket, but then he had the red  one on with the color of ass.  So you knew he was getting, that's how I felt on Studio 60.  Like, every time a black woman was on, I knew the storyline was like I could be at  a table read the holes of a black girl.  I'll say it again, I think the first time we talked I said it, Sting and his stupid  lute fucked up your whole TV career with that Studio 60.  I think it was the fact that, and then Tracy didn't win the Emmy yesterday. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Well, it was confusing.  There's two shows.  One was having fun.  And the other was getting too serious?  Getting too serious.  You can't, you know what I mean?  They should get you for, you know, 30 or a while.  What do you think?  Nah, that's alright.  I don't need Alec Baldwin.  Did he find his song?  Did he find the iPod song?  What is the song?  I don't have my iPod.  The song that, oh, remember the dog, the country song we liked, the dog named Red?  Yeah, the dog named Red where the man went out and got the dog some sex.  Yeah, that was nice.  Got Red some sex. 
[03:35:30]  And a country boy can't survive was nice.  Well, he got the dog some sex so he could break out of jail, which was a story I could  respect.  Like, and I used to love Sting.  I liked Sting.  Yeah, until he started playing the lute.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  We went and saw that crap.  And we had to sit there and politely applaud.  Prince was on years ago with diaper on.  Like, I never, like, you know that you, a dude's a genius when you see thugs in there  and a dude wearing kulaks.  Don't give him respect. 
[03:36:00]  And he still respect that motherfucker.  I like Prince.  Yeah.  Well, he fucked every hot chick on the planet.  You couldn't not like him because he's so beatable.  He's a beatable little man and yet he was fucking tensed.  But, you know, even though he's, like, you feel like you could kick his ass, something  in you goes, I shouldn't do it because maybe he knows some, I don't know.  He knows some kind of fucking moves.  But, I mean, like, a little mousy man with kind of, like, greasy jelly, you shouldn't  like his mustache.  Right.  Right.  I don't like his mustache.  But he's a great artist.  He's, like, who are those artists like that that are transitory that you can, like, 
[03:36:30]  like, black people and white people dig?  Like, who is that?  Bob Marley.  Bob Marley, but he ain't doing it.  Tom Jones.  Hendrix.  Tom Jones.  Don't people like Tom Jones?  Yeah, absolutely.  Tom Jones is the show.  It's not a usual world to be like.  Tom Jones.  John Denver?  Oh, of course.  Now you went.  How do you feel about Bono and you two?  Now, you know what?  I didn't, I never knew a lot about them, but I like that the name of their, one of the 
[03:37:00]  albums, one of the two is Rattle and Hum.  Yeah.  When they did, and there was a group who had System of a Down.  I never knew what they were doing, but I was like, that's a cool ass name.  Yeah.  Like, Steve Arrington was a white guy from Slave, right?  Well, no, he wasn't white.  He wasn't, but he always sounded white.  Steve Arrington.  Like, you know who Slave was?  Sort of, yeah.  Sort of.  We are not connecting.  That's a black group, Slave.  Slave.  Oh, Slave.  No.  You ain't gonna have to be the white guy named Slave.  No, there's a band called Slade, right? 
[03:37:30]  That had one hit.  No, Slave.  Yeah, that's a long time ago.  We can run around in circles and we'll just meet on Lenny Kravitz.  Right.  But he was not a great artist.  No, he was cool.  Y'all got Maury on in the background?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We love him.  And naked white women.  I feel like I'm in the NBA.  This is spectacular.  Maury.  We love Maury.  He comes on the show a lot.  Yeah.  He's a good friend.  Maury's freak show, man.  He just, one day he brought on these primordial dwarves. 
[03:38:00]  These things were about this big and he had them hiding in his office and he's just like,  Where's little Terry?  You're in the trash can.  And I'm sitting there going, Oh, my God.  Maury has just got no conscience.  And he was the serious.  You know, one time I was in Covington, Kentucky.  Remember that?  We'd go to play golf in Covington, where all these people come from.  Like, it's the white projects.  It really is.  Yeah.  So I go to this golf course and it is midgets everywhere.  I swear to God, the place was lousy with midgets. 
[03:38:30]  Lousy with midgets.  And I thought they were fucking around, right?  Lousy with midgets.  That's great.  Nobody in the place could ride shit at Six Flags.  It was just fucking chocked full of midgets.  And I thought Red and them were fucking around with me.  And I was thinking, I'm not going to even trip because they think that they got me fucked up.  That midgets are running around.  And they were all in these golf carts. 
[03:39:00]  But it was a midget.  It was the Billy Barty Memorial Midget Tournament.  Holy shit.  On the same golf course you guys were playing?  Oh, my God.  Damn.  So they had all little clubs and little bags.  And they had a caddy there with no teeth.  But he could tell you all about rock lesson before you got famous.  They had to turn every par three into a par five.  Yeah.  How far can a midget tee off?  And I was like, these motherfuckers are bullshit. 
[03:39:30]  And there ain't nobody.  There's not that many midgets in the world.  Yeah.  How they're all here.  You know, tattoo.  You know.  And he did what they should all do.  Oh, shit.  Shot himself.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  He ate a gun.  Ouch.  It hurts.  You know what's funny?  The shit that they do ban you for is stupid.  But that shit right there.  That shit should get him ripped off the air.  Motherfuckers.  That they should all shoot themselves? 
[03:40:00]  You are talking about.  Jesus, Jimmy.  What are they going to do?  Kick you in the knee?  Yeah.  There really isn't a midget coal.  You watch our own fighting style, right?  Yes, I do.  Oh, there he goes.  Yes, I've created my own fighting style.  You watch how fast we sell you out, too.  As soon as a cop show, I don't know him.  He just.  But he can handle himself.  He looks like Montana Williams.  That's all I do.  Oh, God.  I used to watch that American Gladiators all the time, man.  Yeah, I remember.  And you know, we make him wear.  He wears his uniform around. 
[03:40:30]  You make him wear.  And go grab sandwiches and stuff.  You know, I'm the true live drama from Entourage.  So, I'm a cooter.  We'll make him put on this American Gladiator outfit and go get coffee.  You know, his daughter had a sweet 16 this past summer.  And I actually went upstairs, put it on, ran down, danced with her for two minutes and ran away.  Yes, it's a weird one.  And she loved it.  Really?  She brought chairs around.  Yeah, we.  We don't even know if this is going to make.  Yeah, it'll make it.  They have to be recording. 
[03:41:00]  It's not open.  Now, what?  Did you give her one of those good sweet 16s like the MTV?  Yeah, I did.  Like, crazy ass.  No, no, no.  Like, we're pretty normal.  Where they give her a Benz pulls up at the end of it.  And she cries because it's the wrong color.  It's the wrong color, daddy!  We have an inner circle type of family thing.  You know, we got an extended family of about, what, 50 of us?  Yeah.  And we get together every time they have something together.  Yeah, we're a pretty good family, but we get drunk and cussed together.  Yeah.  And then we leave and say, fuck you, fuck you.  I said that on the radio. 
[03:41:30]  I want to say it one more time.  Fuck you!  All right, that's it.  I'm through.  Feels good, doesn't it?  That's it.  Yes, it does.  Why don't we get the plugs in?  Considering we're doing a show for about 200 people on Hell Talk.  D.L., you had to leave 20 minutes ago, I've got to know, but I guess that didn't matter, right?  Let's get the plugs in.  HBO, this Saturday night, D.L., Hughley's special, Unapologetic?  Unapologetic.  This Saturday, I'm sure this is a great special.  I mean, because the same producer didn't mind it, George said it was great. 
[03:42:00]  Thank you.  And Tuesday is when the DVD comes out.  And if you're in town for the New York Comedy Festival, just think November.  Saturday, November 10th, D.L. is a town hall.  And it's trending.  You've got to get trending, right?  Yes.  Trending, New Jersey, October 4th is the first day that I would contact you.  So we're going on tour.  So I hope O.J. fucks up a little more.  Yeah, right.  I need 15 more minutes.  Keep it in the news.  Keep it going.  And this was one of those shows where there were so many lines, lines of the day.  So we're just going to say, hey, line of the day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net. 
[03:42:30]  Play against our own Travis and weekly Pick'em League and win $4,000.  It's free.  All you have to do is open an account on BodogFantasy.net and pick the weekly winners.  And come up with your own goddamn line of the day.  We're done.  Yeah, there were plenty of them.  Plenty of them.  I just changed you fuckers enough.  Yo, it's always a pleasure.  I'm serious.  If you guys want to stop by tomorrow, we're going to do it, man.  You got a few minutes to kill you want to stop by?  I have had a blast.  And is it a father?  No, he's dead.  He died, what?  90, what? 
[03:43:00]  Not 95 years old, but back in 94.  So you guys share women together?  No, that was the only, I think that was the only thing, like, I think he was, like, fucking  around on his girlfriend with this girl and realized that she was kind of whore-ish, so  it would be cool to kind of hook me up with her.  So your father gave you a whore?  So, yeah, and I wound up, I was fucking this girl for, like, a year, all through school  and everything, but I didn't tell anyone at school because it was, like, one of those  things where it was, like, I don't, I don't even know how to explain this to fucking people. 
[03:43:30]  Right, because she's a teacher?  Yeah, because she was a teacher.  But, like, she would come over to the house and go, like, oh, I want to suck it.  And, like, before school, I'd get, like, a blowjob.  You're lying.  I swear to God, I swear to you, I fucking swear.  I can't even get a blowjob before I go to work.  I can't tell you about it.  It was the oddest goddamn thing.  So ever since then, your life's been going down.  Like, that's it.  That's the top.  Oh, that was, like, now that was the pinnacle? 
[03:44:00]  Nah, you know, you learn a few things out of it because I didn't want to eat her pussy.  That was something.  And then you kind of learn that that's kind of a cool thing to do.  You know what I'm ashamed of, and I'll admit right now that even though you've got the 300 listeners,  like, you know how they say, like, I always liked it.  I always, I, like, and I was ashamed.  And that's not cool for a black guy to say, right?  Now it is, but I was ashamed.  Yeah.  Well, I'll do this shit to your head, Kay, then.  How do you get to the center of a tootsie bottle? 
[03:44:30]  Follow me, goddamn.  That's right.  It's through the asshole.  Like, I was never one of those guys.  That's horrible.  That's classic.  But she had a fucking, like, big, hairy bush on her.  Absolutely.  And I didn't, I was too, like, the fucking part was great.  Felt great.  Right.  You know, I liked looking at her big tits and everything like that.  But the thought of going down there was like, I still wasn't there yet.  Nothing like that.  Still wasn't there.  That nice little seasoning salt taste. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, I was still into, you know, hubba-bubba bubblegum and ice cream sandwiches.  Right.  I needed some sweetener on that.  Can you take a shower?  Little tarts and a quiet taste.  Yeah.  You take a shower.  This is spectacular.  It was great.  It was like one of those.  So do you ever get blowjobs before you come to work?  Uh, I, well, now it's so early in the fucking morning.  It's like four in the morning.  Like, I get wife blowjobs.  Like, my wife will do it, like, when she got something else to do.  Hurry, everybody, I'll go check on the cornbread.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like some shit.  Like, on the, like, this is what my wife does to me one time. 
[03:45:30]  I knew it.  She wanted, like, we've been married 22 years and we got three kids.  So she's having that.  You've been married 22 years?  How old are you?  I'm 43.  So she got, she got that empty nest kind of thing.  Because all the kids are, like, she's worried about that.  So she wants to have another baby and I don't.  So she's going to start going secretly.  Going through this fucking, uh, what is that fertility clinic?  Oh, fertility clinic.  So she, I come home about a year and a half ago and she gives me a blowjob.  And when she finishes, she puts it in this container and runs out the room. 
[03:46:00]  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Remember I had this huge argument about how, like, I felt so, like, I was like, this is so sweet.  And my wife is letting me knock one off.  And then she fucking pulls out a Dixie cup.  She wants to see if they're moving.  And ran and left.  And I was like.  What the fuck was that?  She said, you would never go down there and do it yourself.  So I went down and just to make sure.  And I went.  At least she brought a cup and didn't just drive down with it. 
[03:46:30]  You're hoping one of the bumpy drives.  That was fucking horrible.  I'm glad nobody's hearing this.  You all right?  Who knows?  It might be.  Deal new, Lee.  All right.  A pleasure, man.  Likewise.  All right.  You should have came in hours ago.  I told you very much.  Thank you for letting me just hear you guys.  I love you.  And any time you need me to catch your back on anything, I got you.  Thank you.  Very cool.  I like that. 
[03:47:00]  This is the guy you want.  Pleasure.  Jesus.  Thanks to you.  I had a blast.  Yeah, thanks, man.  I'm done.  Yeah, we're done.  See you tomorrow.  And if you guys want to come by tomorrow or the next day, we're in here.  Thank you very much.  It's okay, Anthony.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Great show, bro.  Thank you, man.  I'm sure he best going to be there today.  No, you're kidding.  See you later, guys.  All the recordings are going to look like we're going to be on.  Yeah, all I got is the last nine minutes.  Because I think if there's a power out of it over there, there's no signal going anywhere.  DC didn't have it. 
[03:47:30]  New York doesn't have it.  Someone will have it.  Wait, we got it.  It didn't go out anywhere.  We didn't leave the board in New York.  Oh, wow.  Paltok has it.  Someone in Paltok has it.  Send an MP3 to Steve.  I have the off-air audio.  What if they get it from Paltok and you go, well, here at the...  Yeah, but the quality will be for shit.  You'll have to make some sort of announcement.  Someone's got 10 minutes of it. 
[03:48:00]  They're listening to this right now.  Someone says they got the audio.  They got 10 minutes of it.  Whoever has all of it, please send it to danny at foundrymusic.com.  Danny at foundrymusic.com.  Or Eric.  And then you guys just make an announcement going, look, the show cut off at this point.  There was a blackout.  Paltok captured it, so the audio's going to be weird, but just in case you missed it.  That would be great.  Okay.  And then go to this.  You're right, because then you've got a good quality here, right?  Have fun with it today.  Okay.  Have fun. 
[03:48:30]  Um, yeah.  A blackout?  So, Travis thinks somebody over there got careless with a pickaxe.  Oh, are you shitting me?  They fucking, like, the construction people might have...  Travis.  Yeah.  Are you sure it's a construction-related...  Construction might have fucking nailed a wire.  I'm not 100% sure, but I'm 90% sure.  Power just stopped...  It just stopped.  How long ago?  Uh...  20 minutes ago.  Oh, like 20 minutes ago, yeah.  Yeah, that happens.  Yeah, not at...  But it was everything, like the entire...  That's good. 
[03:49:00]  That'll postpone the studio being done in, like, fucking for another year.  Dude, patch it up.  Danny, somebody might sign you with a power talk.  Patch it up.  But someone has to make an announcement, go, this is where the show cut out, because, you  know, the power went dead.  The problem is...  Power talk, record it.  Here it is.  And then patch it back up with this.  Yeah.  It was too good not to.  What about Ron and Fez?  They're going to be back up.  They'll be back up.  Oh, they will?  Someone has to set it up immediately, because as of right now, there's nothing.  Like, it should have been recorded in D.C., but I guess we're patched into New York,  and then from New York to D.C., so if New York goes out, D.C. gets nothing. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  So...  All right.  Somebody email the audio to...  Steve, I got the one.  Danny at FoundryMusic.com.  I will be downloading it in two seconds.  Oh.  Once somebody does.  Do a little intro, which you can...  Do you have access to it?  Anyone have it?  Then I'll paste it.  I can get it.  No, no cockpit.  No cockpit.  It just interferes with the time.  We don't have the time for cockpicks.  Just the audio.  There's always time for...  We would love a cockpick, but we don't have time for it.  At 3 p.m., start sending cockpicks. 
[03:50:00]  Cockpicks.  No, send them now.  Send cockpicks to my personal email.  And ask them if their quality is good, what they take on CalTalk.  I don't know if they would consider good or not.  Yeah, because you've got to upload it on TV.  Any good...  You have good quality.  Okay, TJ from Philly.  It's going to sound, I mean...  Not necessarily.  TJ from Philly says he's got good quality audio, so email.  It doesn't have to sound crystal clear.  If you could hear it and you could still laugh at it, that's all that matters.  And then we just go on there and go, the show went black at this point, but PalTalk taped it. 
[03:50:30]  That would be interesting, people, like, to patch it together.  Don't just go patch it.  Someone has to make an announcement.  We're going to cut liners.  Let's meet right quick.  All right.  Get the stuff out of the way.  Okay.  Danny at FoundryMusic.com or Eric at FoundryMusic.com.  Thank you.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio. 
[03:51:00]  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio.  I'm cutting off the audio. </pre>
