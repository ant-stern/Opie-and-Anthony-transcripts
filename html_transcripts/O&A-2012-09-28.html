<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a raucous discussion surrounding a viral video of a woman claiming to have received a free cell phone from the Obama administration â€“ an "Obama phone."  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton reacted with a mixture of laughter and outrage, dissecting the video, the Lifeline program (which predates Obama), and the broader issues of welfare and government spending.  The segment included numerous listener calls offering various perspectives and anecdotes, punctuated by repeated plays of the viral video and a song parodying "Banana Phone."  The conversation devolved into vulgar commentary and offensive remarks about the political implications of the situation.  They also covered Ann Coulter's contentious appearance on "The View," playing clips and commenting on the political divide and the challenges of discussing race.  Upcoming guests, including Bob Kelly, Frank Caliendo, and Anthony Bourdain, were mentioned.  The segment concluded with a discussion about their contract renewal.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of a Deadspin video showing NFL referees receiving a hero's welcome, which the hosts satirized as a wrestling-style storyline.  This segued into a discussion of a brutal football hit, with graphic descriptions of the injury and mocking of the on-field prayers.  The hosts then focused on the documentary about Adam Greenberg, the baseball player hit in the head in his only major league at-bat, expressing cynicism towards the "feel-good" narrative surrounding his return.  They extended this cynicism to similar stories involving wheelchair-bound athletes.  A large portion of the segment was devoted to playing audio from Lil Wayne's deposition, highlighting his frequent use of "I don't recall" and eliciting humorous commentary from the hosts.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a BuzzFeed article listing depressing facts about popular music, focusing on sales figures of various artists, and a video of Carrie Underwood giving a 12-year-old boy his first kiss, which they reacted to with shock and humor.  Bob Kelly and Frank Caliendo were in studio.  Frank Oz and Anthony Bourdain were mentioned as upcoming guests.

Frank Caliendo and Bob Kelly, in studio, promoted their upcoming shows.  The conversation centered heavily on the food at Levity Live, with detailed descriptions of various menu items.  Caliendo discussed his impressions, his process, and the evolution of his act, including his former George W. Bush routine.  A clip from "Move That Bus" prompted humorous commentary and even tears from Bob Kelly.  Other topics included Honey Boo Boo, a comparison of Caliendo's Las Vegas residency to other performers' experiences, Terry Fader from *America's Got Talent*, and Anthony Bourdain's departure from *No Reservations* and his upcoming CNN series.  The segment included extensive discussion of Bourdain's travel experiences, restaurant reviews (including a scathing one of Lady Gaga's parents' restaurant), and opinions on various chefs.  Troy, a staff member, was briefly interviewed.  A significant portion of the segment involved the comedic struggle to find and display various online clips, with much interaction between the hosts and the technical staff, E-Rock and Sam.  The segment concluded with further promotion of the comedians' shows.  Profanity and crude humor were frequent.

Anthony Bourdain appeared in studio, discussing his new food and travel show, his experiences filming in dangerous locations (including Beirut during a bombing), and employing former SAS security personnel.  He recounted harrowing interactions with crime bosses and law enforcement, including a memorable incident involving a cop unzipping his pants.  He also detailed a tense encounter with Brazilian police while traveling with Patrice O'Neal. The segment discussed his production methods and filming challenges.  Frank Oz also appeared, discussing his career, including directing Marlon Brando in *The Score*, the challenges of working with Brando, his work on *Little Shop of Horrors*, and his *Sesame Street* work and its recent parental advisories.  The segment interwove these interviews with "FU" calls and plugs for upcoming events, including a Bourdain roast benefiting a food bank. Bob Kelly was again mentioned.

The final segment focused on the potential end of Opie and Anthony's contract.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Sam Roberts speculated about future employment, including a potential new show for Jim and Sam.  Sam's viral video (3.3 million views) was discussed extensively. Numerous callers, including Mona (discussing Sam's video), Rick, Coke Logic, Glenn, Sabian (mentioning drawings of Patrice O'Neal), and Jake (announcing his retirement), contributed to the conversation.  Bob Kelly and his stand-up performances were frequently mentioned, alongside a recurring comedic bit about Jerry Shepardini.  The hosts discussed interactions with Bourdain and Oz. The conversation was filled with crude humor, sexual innuendo, and offensive language, with frequent interruptions and playful insults.  The segment concluded with speculation about the show's future and final goodbyes, once again referencing "Jerry Shepardini."

[00:09:00]  He's a little uptight  With the blacks too  I think  Uh  He writes  The Obama phone program  Is real  And he sent me an article  What is the Obama phone program  At  Well  If you are  Fool  Stan  If you  Dis  If not  If you  If you are on  Disability  If you  Disability  God  Add in the other words  You fucking  Dumb shit  If you  Disability  If you're a  Fool  Stan  Obama 
[00:09:30]  Free cell phone program  The government  Uh  Lifeline  Program  Offers a free cell phone  At 250  Free  Minutes  Each month  That's great  Good for  What exactly  Is the free  Obama phone  Learning about this  For the first time  People need to have  Phones  Not for any emergencies  Or anything like that  It's pretty much  Because if you don't  Have a phone  And do  Uh  They're racist  And they're  Keeping down  People  Because  They're keeping them  From having  Their constitutional right  Which  If you notice 
[00:10:00]  It is  An amendment  To the constitution  That says  Every American  Um  Is entitled  To a cell phone  Yeah we're pretty much  Stomping all over  The constitution  At this point  Aren't we  I'm not happy  About that myself  Because I think we should  Try to keep to that  But  Uh  The free Obama phone  Is a program  That is meant to help  The financially unstable  Who cannot afford  Access to a cell phone  Communication should not  Be limited to people  In relation to what  They are able to afford  The lifeline program  Was actually created  Decades ago  Decades ago  Oh yeah  Decades ago  Yep  I hear that 
[00:10:30]  I know that  To help low income  Families have access  To landlines  So why are they  Calling it the Obama phone  Program if it was  Something that was  Created decades ago  Well because  No one really  Not no one  But it was  Very um  It wasn't as big  A program as it is now  When Obama took office  A lot of these  Welfare programs  Just took off  I mean people  Are all upset  That they're calling  Obama the food stamp  President  But food stamp  Use is 
[00:11:00]  Is  Highest that it's  Ever been  It's all these  All these  Entitlements  That are going  Out to people  That give people  No ambition  To work for anything  Are just destroying  This country's  Willingness to  Perform  To create  Where these  Bunch of lazy  Motherfuckers  Sitting back  On the backs  Of the few  That are actually  Doing something  During the Bush 
[00:11:30]  Administration  There was the  Introduction of a  Project that gave  Subsidies  To those who  Could not afford  A phone  The basic principle  Of the program  Is that everyone  Should have access  To emergency  Services like  9-1-1  Yeah remember  Fucking pay phones  What about before  Cell phones  They didn't give you  A fucking  Oh they gave you  A landline  I know that  Okay and that's  The problem  Here it is  Because now I'm  Remembering  That  That program  Was a landline  In your house  That you could  Have  Not a cell phone  You know 
[00:12:00]  To cart around  With you  The only difference  Is there's not  As many pay phones  Now as there used  To be  Of course not  They used to be  You could just  Walk outside  And find a pay phone  Oh in a second  But I mean  It's one of these  Programs that are  Just taking off  Now they're  Homeless bathroom  Stalls  Bunch of people  They really are  In New York City  I mean just  Step into one of  Those and wow  The smell  There are a number  Of deaths that  Take place every year  Due to lack  Of proper communication  And access to  Emergency services  Should be a right  For everyone  There you go 
[00:12:30]  The free Obama phone  Is an important  Program especially  For low income  Families that would  Otherwise not have  Access to basic  Communications  There are different  Plans to choose from  Some plans offer  Fewer minutes  And more texting  And some even  Include rollover minutes  Make sure you check  Out all the plans  Before choosing  The one that is  Right for you  And can we not  Call it free phone  Please  I love free  Free when they say  Yeah that's free  No  People are paying  For it  Taxpayers  You know  The people that  Pay fucking taxes  In this country 
[00:13:00]  They're paying for it  The government  Doesn't have money  It's the fucking  People's money  I'll tell you this much  You know  I'm sure the program  Means well  But I'm sure  There's a lot of people  That are taking advantage  Of free Obama phones  Plenty of abuse  How I read it  It sounds like  Alright you got this  Cell phone  But you can't just  Start calling people  This is for emergencies  For the most part  How many drug phones  Are free Obama phones  Come on  Let's get real here a minute  Fuck wads  I don't care  How many minutes  Do you get  Like how does it work 
[00:13:30]  You should only be able  To dial 9-1-1  Right  Well that would be  The proper way to do it  But then they probably  Think well  People would abuse us  Yeah what if you got  A problem with  You know your kid  Or something  And you gotta  I don't know  Whatever  Whatever  My god  My god man  Can we hear that again  It's just another abused  Program  The point being  You're not just  Getting a cell phone  Because you vote for Obama  She sure thinks so  She thinks  If I go to the voting booth  And I vote for Obama  They're handing me a cell phone  That day 
[00:14:00]  That's how I see this video  And that's not it at all  Some of the people  That are voting for Obama  Have no fucking clue  What is going on  In this country  And this woman  Is a prime example  Look at her  Stand up with people  That  I guess it's some  Mitt Romney  Romney event  And they're protesting it  And look at the woman  To the left  Mitt Romney  And then it's something  She's got a sign  It says Mitt Romney  Something something shit  That's great  When your protest sign  Has shit on it 
[00:14:30]  Wow  You have to love that  I find it very funny  Like the  Just that shot  Is funny  But it's a whole  Thing  That's going on  There is a  Burden  In this fucking country  That is just  Not addressed  Because you're  Not allowed  To address it  And it's costing  This country  Dearly  Financially  Socially  Every which way  It's costing  This country  But no one can  Dare not speak it  Dare not speak it

[00:24:30]  Every year  Or whatever  So it's lying there  For 30 minutes  So people probably  Do that as well  Because why would they  You know  Fuck up a free phone  Right  So you make sure  You use all your minutes  That's fucking ridiculous man  I'm down  All right  Let me go to  Ridiculous man  Let me go to  Let me go to Stump Brain  Who makes believe  He's a moderate  What's up Stump Brain  No no no  Not a moderate  Just leaning to  Wherever my wallet  Needs to go  Exactly  What's going on pal 
[00:25:00]  We've been on this guy  Who recorded this  In Ohio  For over  Almost a day  And a half now  And these people  That you're talking about  At the Romney event  Who were protesting  Mitt Romney  Were being paid  11 bucks an hour  By the SEIU union  Wow  And we actually have  Video of the same group  Including that woman  Who were all  Buffed from there  Then to Toledo  So she's also  Been at a Toledo protest  But let me ask you  I'm going to stop you  For a second  And I want the answer 
[00:25:30]  To this  Doesn't both sides  Pay for people  To show up and shit  Wasn't there stories  About Romney  Bussing in supporters  For some of his events  Well they all  Buss in supporters  For like  You're talking about  The Latino conference  That was last week  And Romney had  The audience  With his people  Right  Which is  Yeah they both  Put people behind him  To make the right  Photo op  For their campaigns  But this is a union  Right  Taking union dues  From people who are 
[00:26:00]  Like pin knockers  Out there  And taking that money  And using it  To pay people  To stand down the street  With signs  And scream  Against a candidate  Right  Which seems kind of  Bizarre to me  But yeah  Both campaigns  Stack all their events  To try and get  The right photo ops  But this is paying  People to show up  And Romney's  You don't think  Romney's ever paid people  To show up  To protest  Well  I'm just asking  I really don't know  The answer  To be honest with you  You know  I'll bet  Something like that's  Happened  But this is  This is not the campaign  This is a union 
[00:26:30]  Okay  Who's taking union dues  From its members  And using it to do this  But you guys are exactly  Right about this  This phone program  It's been going on  For a long time  And the cell phones  Since the Bush administration  Right  And it's  But it's doubled  Wait  Mike did that start  That started during  The Bush administration  The cell phone part  There was  As Anthony was explaining  The landline  Meant to give people  Emergency calls  But yeah  The cell phone thing  Really popped  During the Bush administration  I didn't know that  But it  Yeah I knew that 
[00:27:00]  But it wasn't  As abused  As it is now  Under the Obama administration  It's so easy  But how do we know  Where are the stats  That show that  It's really being abused now  Oh  I did a report on it  Yeah  And it has the number  Said it's over  1.8 billion  And if you  A year  We just  Waste our money though  Although you know  How we get that money  Oh shit  Give Egypt nothing  Right  Take that money  Nice  And then use that  For the cell phones  There that  That's a wash  There you go  So that money  What's the logic  Behind this program 
[00:27:30]  Well I guess  Why does the government  Do this  I mean we read  A little something  But in your words  To me it looks like  They're just trying  To help people  And that's part  Of the benevolence  Of big government  And you know  If you help people  Get medical attention  When they need it  It's going to be cheaper  Than finding them  In emergency situations  But it's just been abused  Now there are ads everywhere  If you get on transit  In every major city  It says  If you need a cell phone  To get a job 
[00:28:00]  You might be able  To get a free one  And all these companies  Jumped on it  Because they're getting  Reimbursed by the government  So there's a huge amount  Of opportunists  Who have jumped in  To provide cell phones  For all these people  It's not just one company  And the phones  Don't come from Obama  Right  They come from companies  Who are getting reimbursed  By the government  Had no idea man  How do we make sure  These programs aren't abused  Because they mean well  On paper  Yeah  But then in the end  They're always abused  How do we 
[00:28:30]  How do we figure that out  Well it's just like everything  You've got to make it tougher  And you've got to  You have to enforce  The standards  Hans will tell you  There's too many gun laws  But we don't enforce them  Yeah  We don't enforce the ones  That work  It applies to everything  You can have all the laws  You want  But if no one's enforcing it  Look at immigration  Look at voting  You know  Everything has rules  But if they're not enforced  And not followed  The system just runs  Out of control  Wow  But why are they calling it  An Obama phone  Because I didn't know  It started with Bush either 
[00:29:00]  I think it's because  Of the woman  You know  I know  They're out there  And Obama gave me a phone  But you know  They associate it with  Who's ever in charge  That's who's given it to them  Oh boy  Is that going to make  People outraged  That video is everywhere  Yep  You got something on  The blaze on this thing  You said  It's been up for  Over a day now  And it has been  The top independent clip  That we've had  And I talked to the guy  He shot it  He's just a  He's just a local Ohio guy  Who saw this 
[00:29:30]  And started talking to people  He also shot a clip  Of another Obama supporter  Saying that our ambassador  In Libya  Probably deserved to be killed  Of course  Because we weren't supposed to be there  Of course  There's a bunch of interesting clips  From Ohio on the blaze this morning  You might want to check it out  Wait who said that?  There was an Obama supporter  Who was being talked to  By the same guy  Who shot this clip  And he asked him  Why he was voting for Obama  And he said  Because Romney's going to tax  Poor people  Of course  And he asked him 
[00:30:00]  What about Libya  And the guy said  Well that ambassador  Probably deserved to be killed  Because we shouldn't have been there  You know  He's just a supporter  Like you could find  You could probably find  Romney supporters  Who believe  That Christ  Hung out with dinosaurs  Sure  Do you know what I mean?  You know what though?  You know what though?  If somebody believes  Christ hung out with dinosaurs  It ain't no money  Out of my fucking pocket  Obama supporters  With their fucking  Entitlement shit  Enough already 
[00:30:30]  Cut them off  That is true  It will cost you less  Because definitely  The Christ dinosaur people  Don't want funded abortions  Right  They will cost you less  Exactly  Great point  Alright Mikey  Another good phone call  Go to theblaze.com  Stumpling works there  Hey I have one more question  For Mike  The thing about  The blind shake  I saw that on the news  But the volume wasn't  Is there anything  Happening with that?  You said that was a possibility  They were thinking  Of releasing him  Well it looks like  All the pressure on that  Has finally forced 
[00:31:00]  Those negotiations  To slow down  But we still believe  There's an undercurrent  Happening in state  State is right now  Chasing the whole  Libyan story  Because that thing  Is unraveling  The real reason  Behind the attack  At Libya  And then the follow up  Is going to come out  But it's  It may be on par  With Watergate  When we all get through  With it  But it'll  I don't want to bore  The hell out of you  With it this morning  But it is fascinating  To watch  Did you hear  Dinesh D'Souza on yesterday?  Yeah I was going to  Call you guys and say  Wow you had some 
[00:31:30]  Amazing guests  And I love Dinesh  And that movie  As Anthony said  Will scare the hell out of you  But he was great  With you guys  I loved hearing that  Yeah his  Anti-colonialism  Take on Obama  Was something I hadn't  Thought of before  And it actually made  A lot of sense  He's a smart guy  Yeah when you think  About a president  Who as a teenager  Never had a 4th of July  Experience  Never watched a parade  Because he was  In Indonesia  It kind of gives you  Some perspective  On where this guy  Grew up  Alright buddy 
[00:32:00]  Yeah  Thank you so much boys  See you later  Alrighty  Alright Mike  So there you go  You know why  I liked that guy yesterday  Because he wasn't  Fanatical  Or unbending  He just  You know  This is his opinion  And he made a smart  I thought  Smart documentary  But he wasn't  Obsessed  With  No no  It's like  He wasn't one of those guys  So I found him enjoyable  Yeah it wasn't a right wing  Version of Michael Moore  Who just takes his agenda  And fucking  Shoves it down your throat  This is more of a  Here I'm presenting this 
[00:32:30]  This is what I believe  And here are some facts  In there  And you take away with it  What you want  Yeah  Alright  You mentioned Whoopi  Goldberg and Ann Coulter  Who added on the view  Whoopi  Whoopi  Good old Whoopi  Goldberg  Yeah  I used to like her too  Yeah  I haven't heard  The full version  Of this clip  I just  Like I said earlier  So disappointed  On her take  On the I Miss thing  If you notice  In this clip  She's from that 
[00:33:00]  School of thought  Where white people  Are incapable  Of talking about  Black people  You're just incapable  How do you know  Have you ever been black  That whole thing  Shut the fuck up  Yeah because that  That angle annoys me too  It's a way of diffusing  Yes  A smart point  Hey you don't have an argument  Oh right  I'm not black  Because that's like saying  Whoopi Goldberg is a woman  Well you shouldn't  Ever ever discuss  Male issues  Because you've never been a man  That's a bullshit cop out  Yeah 
[00:33:30]  Alright let's play the clip here  With the OJ verdict  White America said  That's it  The white guilt bank  Is shut down  And that ended up  Being the best thing  That ever happened  What do you mean  What are you talking about  I meant that  No longer  Was being acquitted  Was good for hope  Yes because you had  Millions of white people  Watching  With the equivalent  Of what in New York  We used to refer to  As the Brooklyn juries  Who simply would not convict  Even guilty black criminals  Oh  Hold up Miss Coulter  Please stop  Please stop 
[00:34:00]  If you're going to  Talk about race  At least  At least  Know what you're talking about  What is that  There you go  We'll be making a good point  Is she in enemy fucking territory there  And then the view audience  Woo I'm a guilty white person  Oh god  And Anne was giving her  She was giving an informed opinion  Yes  If you don't agree with it  Just say no  Here's why you're wrong  Because they would convict you back then  You know  Right  Have a counterpoint to it 
[00:34:30]  Of course  Talking about  At least know what you're talking about  You can't just discount her like that  No  Tell me how much you know  About being black  Well this isn't about being black  Well but you just said  This is  You just made all these statements  About how black people feel  Tell me how you know  Yeah you did  This is not a book about black people  It is a book about white liberals  And I do know  And this is a fact  That once for years  Republican policies on crime and welfare  For example  Were called racist  When they finally got implemented 
[00:35:00]  After the OJ verdict  I might add  By crime  Giuliani in New York  Reagan and Bush judges overall  Tens of thousands of black lives  Were saved  That is a fact  I don't have to know  About being black  Because you're  You're  You're  You're  What is  What are your facts  Are a little  Just a little shaky  I mean  You're saying that  Because  Black people  Are alive  Because liberals  Are what  Because liberals  Have abandoned black people now 
[00:35:30]  This is what  What's happening right here  Yeah I know exactly  And this is what happens  To Ann Calder all the time  Yeah  If she says something  And you think  It's  Yeah fuck you  You're not supposed to like it  But listen to the counterpoint  She's just reacting  Because Ann Calder  Said something about race  Right  That she doesn't like  Because it's coming out of that  Little thin white mouth  Exactly  And blonde hair  She doesn't know how to handle it  But she's giving nothing  She's giving no counterpoint  None  Whatsoever  Other than an emotional reaction 
[00:36:00]  Of well you don't know  What it's like to be black  And wait wait wait  You  It's like  She has no idea  How to respond to that  But she feels she has to  Because they've been trained  Every democrat  Liberal  They've been trained  To not allow white people  To discuss race  And Ann is hated  By a lot of people  And I get  Hey look  If you hate her opinion  That's fine  But you can't sit there  And say she's dumb  And if you're gonna debate her  On her book  And race  You better be fucking prepared 
[00:36:30]  I hate her  I hate her  Because she could eat anything  And it just doesn't go to her thighs  Like me  Stay so slender  But that's  But that's  That reaction is really  Just Whoopi being  And Whoopi's not a dumb person  She's just  She can't figure out  How to respond  Because she's annoyed  And she shouldn't be annoyed  By what Ann just said  She's blinded at times  Totally blinded by race  In this discussion  Blows off her own intelligence  And is blinded by race  That's exactly it  Because she said  These  All these  All these  Policies 
[00:37:00]  Implemented by  Bush and Reagan judges  Saved black lives  You better have an answer for that  Not just  You're not black  Right  That's pretty much  What she said  You're  Black people  Are law  Because liberals  Are what  Because liberals  Have abandoned black people now  Because  What  I don't get it  I don't understand  I don't get it  Did you say that then  We got part two here  Oh yeah  Liberals don't care about black people  Then are you saying 
[00:37:30]  Republicans  Embrace us  She shouldn't even be able  To talk that one  Because she still thinks  The earth is flat  Oh my gosh  Every time she talks  That's all I could think of  Is when she didn't know  They should pretty much  Tell her  Shut up  She was on the show  Don't worry  We'll talk pop culture  And you can have a little  Fun with that  But don't  Not the heavy lifting shit  They were quizzing her  About the earth  And whether it was flat or not  As a goof  Really  Can we play that  And she was like  I don't  I don't know  I think she annoys me  More than any of them  She's terrible 
[00:38:00]  She said by the way  She actually had a better question  Than Whoopi did  She said  So what are you saying  Republicans embrace us  There you go  That's at least  Some kind of a counterpoint  Saying  You know what  Maybe I should listen  No but  Because all I think is  She thinks the earth is flat  I don't want to know  Anything else  For this dumb run  Don't be Whoopi Goldberg  You're doing a Whoopi Ann  Yeah but come on  We can pretty much prove  At this point  That the earth is not flat  Yeah  I think almost  We could all be in agreement  Unless you want to be  One of those assholes 
[00:38:30]  That has to just  Be the opposite guy  Always  Is this the  The world is flat  Flip how long is it  30 seconds  Yeah it's worth playing again  And then we get back  To the Whoopi fight  With Ann Coulter  Is the world flat  Is the world flat  Yes  I don't know  What do you think  I never thought about it  Whoopi  Is the world flat  I never thought about it  You never thought about  Whether the world was round  No because  But I'll tell you  What I've thought about  How I'm going to feed my child  Oh shut up  And my family  The world 
[00:39:00]  Is the world flat  Has never entered into  That has not been  An important thing to me  You'll teach your son  Jeffrey right  If my son Jeffrey  Asked me if the world flat  I guess I will go  And what  And what  Study up on  The world being flat  Does anyone know  What that's about  Yeah she's dumb  She is a dunce  No I mean  What is that about  Is she  Does that support  Some point of view  No  Like a dinosaur point of view  Or something  No  She just honestly  Didn't know  She's a dummy  She's a dummy 
[00:39:30]  She hasn't looked at  All the cool shots  From space  The pictures  People that aren't  That don't have that knowledge  Don't have a lot of knowledge  That's pretty fucking basic  And that  That shows you  How much other stuff  She doesn't know  Because if you don't know  The world isn't a sphere  You don't know a lot about  The you know  The space program  You haven't looked at  Pictures of the earth  Like there's so many things  She hasn't done  To have that  On her mind  And what do they say  I feed my kids  Oh okay  What do they say 
[00:40:00]  The earth is rounder than  What was it  A cue ball  Oh if you shrunk the earth down  Even with it's highest mountains  And it's deepest ocean  Just shrunk it down  Shrunk it down  You don't flatten the mountains  Or nothing  Right  Go ahead  And you shrunk it down  To the size of a  I think it was a cue ball  A cue ball  Yeah  It would be as smooth as the cue ball  It would be  They said it would be smoother  Yeah  Yeah  That's how smooth the earth is  That's how smooth it is  Because even with the mountains  And the deepness of the oceans  Right  The vastness of the earth 
[00:40:30]  Doesn't even make a little  Ding ding  Nothing  Isn't that amazing  Do you mean  Well I think what you're talking about  Is singularity  And that's  Ah  Singularity  That's what happens  If that's the smallest  Like the sun singularity  I think  Or singular  Whatever  Is I think a mile and a half  That's as small  With all the pressure in the universe  That's as small as the sun  Could ever get  Where they sip  No power can make it smaller  Well I'm actually talking about  Literally taking the earth  Without pressure 
[00:41:00]  Or anything  And shrinking it down  To the size of a pool ball  Wow  It wouldn't be  It wouldn't be rough  It wouldn't be like  A rough mountainous  Feeling thing  It would feel very smooth  Because those peaks and valleys  Don't really amount to much  And some say  It's smoother than a cue ball  Yeah  If you squash it down  To the size of a cue ball  Yeah  See imagine that  Earth in the corner pocket  Fucking take us out  You pig  Ah no  We just started  We got food  A few more minutes  And stuff  I didn't mean Iraq  Oh  Here's part two  Of the Whoopi Goldberg  And Coulter fight  With uh 
[00:41:30]  What's her name  Sherry Shepard  Sherry Shepard  Sherry or Sherry  Sherry Shepard  Pipe it in  So are you saying  Liberals don't care  About black people  Then are you saying  Republicans embrace us  In a warm  Fuzzy  We're not embraced back  No  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  So the southern strategy  Was a white liberal thing  No  It was a republican thing  And also  Newt Gingrich calls  President Obama  The food stamp president  That's not racist  In this chapter  No  It's not racist 
[00:42:00]  Do you believe it was racist  For Newt to say  That the president  Is the food stamp president  Can you dive into that  I'm not a big fan of Newt  So if you can just skip that  For a second  And get to the southern strategy  Because I've specifically  Disproved it  It's an absolutely  Liberal folklore  Republicans were winning  The south  Since 1920  It was the outer states  Of the south  It was Texas  Tennessee  Kentucky  Virginia  What are you talking about  We weren't allowed to vote  Who was trying to get them to vote  Republicans were  And the first black congressmen 
[00:42:30]  Were all Republicans  And the first black governor  Was a Republican  We were talking about  Way back  The strong minister  Is so different  From how we get now  That is definitely  What we're told  But in fact  The black  The Democratic segregationists  Were all liberal Democrats  It is a lie  That they were conservative Democrats  It was a segregationist  Darling  And you know  Basically  Everybody was  White people were  It didn't matter  Whether they were  Republicans  See  Whoopi's Kate  And she meant to say  White people were 
[00:43:00]  Black people were  But she realized  She couldn't say that  Right  And's right  Republicans back then  Were I think  Considered the liberal party  Though  How long ago  When Lincoln was around  In the 1800s  Isn't that weird  I think that's kind of changed  When did it switch  Don't know  Because we just assumed  The Republicans  Were always right leaning  What about the Whigs  When did that switch  What about the Whig party  Does anybody know  I really don't know  I mean  The New Deal  You silly goose  In the 40s  The New Deal I think  FDR  Right  But it might have been 
[00:43:30]  Way before that  That it switched  Whoopi said bullshit there  That's why it goes  Dark for a second  It didn't matter  Whether they were  Republicans  Or not  Thank you for saying  The first  No  Let me ask you  No that's not  Are you  Okay just read  Chapter 14  In this book  The first  The Republicans  Have divorced  My grandmother  Who was there  Who remembers  What happened  With a little bit  Of emotion  Whoopi  Thank you  And an observation 
[00:44:00]  Women cannot argue  No  Because they all just  Yap at the same time  Great  When guys  When guys argue in general  You want to make your points  So you sort of wait  For the other guy  Right  Because you know  You're just going to be  Drowned out  So you try to pick your spot  With these hens  It's all  At the same time  Hens  I love when they call hens  Well fuck  I don't even know  What was said  In the last 20  30 seconds  Of that clip  And all of them  Are trying to make points  And Anna's standing there  Fucking just belting them  Yeah 
[00:44:30]  She's belting them all  Because they're all arguing  From this emotional point  None of them are giving  Any type of a good  Counterpoint back  I think she's a sick fuck  Because she really enjoys that  Well she knows  She's going to sell books  She really enjoys it man  She lives for that shit  Yeah  I actually live for confrontation too  What am I saying  But in a different way  She's been on that end of it  So many times  It's almost like  She loves it  It's not the way  You're not going to beat her  By doing that  You're not going to face her  She's prepared to argue it  You're right  And you're not going to face her  She's prepared to argue it 
[00:45:00]  But you're not going to face her  She is  You're just not  No  What do we know about  The Republican Party  Did you look that up Sam  Or are you too busy  Looking at your views  Yeah  Sam  3.3  I'm watching  Sam views  We have passed 3.3  But  I mean it depends on  This is one of those things  That people just have opinions on  Like one person said  It was Reagan  It was as late as that  Because Strom Thurmond  No  But Strom Thurmond  No  Was a Democrat  Yeah but Nixon was  Reagan  How about Nixon  Right  Nixon was in the 60s 
[00:45:30]  Who knows this shit  It depends on  The opinion of the person  You're asking  I think  Yeah  Hmm  Because there were conservative  Democrats  In the 50s  Was McCarthy  Was McCarthy  What was McCarthy  Let me guess  A Beatle  He's one of the Beatles  Stupid  No that's McCartney  You fucking  You're incorrigible  I think it was  Check McCartney  I'm pretty sure  It was Republican  I want to know  When the switch  Happened  That was in the 50s  I'm sure  It took a little while  But when did the switch 
[00:46:00]  Start happening  But she  And is right  That they were  Republicans  Were the liberal party  Back then  Hmm  Alright  We should take a break  Food's here  Food's here  Oh yeah  Oh that's cool  Because I got my  Fucking song  Kenny has the food  Here he comes  Here he comes  It's a song  Terrible  It's a great song  Oh is that awful  We have a lot of guests today  Yes we do

[00:52:30]  But you never know  With this place  And I'll shut up right now  Before I ruin it  This is the last show  Of this contract  Yeah  Yeah so I'm doing another one  It would be nice  I'll be doing another one  In some form  You might know that much  No come on  I mean do another contract  Here  I'll bring food on Monday  Yeah we'll do it  Let's plan a big show  For Monday  It always comes down to food  Yeah  With Roland  I want to know about  Yes 
[00:53:00]  I want to know about  The refs coming back  A lot of excitement  Something we said  On this show  Is going to happen  By the way  Why don't we get credit  Well I would think  A couple of other people  Might have said  The refs are coming back  No  At some point  No  I sure didn't  That was it  It was professional  Remember  I mean professional  I strongly disagreed  With Travis's point  I didn't think they'd be back  And I said  No way  It's just too much  They came back last night  And an actual sports league 
[00:53:30]  Listened to their fans  That's really strange to me  Yeah Roger Goodall gave it  They listened to the almighty dollar  Ah  Got them by the purse strings  Then again  It didn't come down to the fans  No  He gave like a half-assed apology  I think there were  Some threats to  You know  Lawsuit threats  Because if one of these guys  Got hurt  Because a dumb replacement ref  Wasn't doing the right thing  Man I would  I would assume  That would be a massive lawsuit  Yeah it was probably more  About the players threatening  How were the rest  Were they the rest  No they were fine  Yeah  And they got a standing ovation 
[00:54:00]  Yeah they walked out  That'll never happen again  No  Oh we'll get back to him  Everyone was very happy  The announcers were very happy  To talk about  Oh here's the first review  And the first flag  Any calls that were like  Questionable  Not that I saw  But I mean look  They weren't perfect before  They're not going to be perfect now  They better be  They sure better be  With their new deal  With that money  They better be  Right  And what  Ravens beat the Browns  23-16  23-16  Browns have a good team this year  I don't know  Nope  No  So what happened to your Ravens 
[00:54:30]  That's a little close  Oh you know  It was a little rainy  You know  A little close there  And what happened to Cribs  Holy fuck  Cribs went down  Oh  Oh yeah  We almost  We almost had a paralyzed player  Last night  Yeah I think the video  Is actually up on Deadspin  Did they really film the referees  Coming in from the locker room  Yes they did  They did last night  Oh no  It's like wrestling  Do they have the  Do they have the  Do they have any ovation  They've got the video  Do they have any ovation  Oh god  The refs walk  It's a great audio 
[00:55:00]  Goldberg  This is ridiculous  Sports  It's sports entertainment  Now it is  Yeah  Look we hear it  They're lifting their hats up  Like they're heroes  Oh god  And so Eugene Steratore  And his group  With 70 years of experience  You can see Ray Lewis  The players are happy  The officials  They got music  The players are happy  The officials  Are back  On the game 
[00:55:30]  That's a storyline  One time  When I was watching the TV  They made a bad call  I was like  What's the matter ref  You forget your glasses  You got the cribs  Yeah it's going to play  In nine seconds  After this advertisement  A cribs movie  Yay  Oh no  It's different uncle  They got to make those softer  So they don't hurt your thighs  So much  The crib bars  Watch this fucking hit  Well you can't 
[00:56:00]  Because we don't have a visual  I don't know  But you can watch it yourself  Somewhere  Boom  That is a hell of a hit  Let me play it  On the 26  You'll get a shot at it  Oh my god  How's that guy walking  Holy shit  Is he doing the chicken  On the ground there  A little bit  He's completely on his back  Is he out  Did he get knocked out  Yeah I think  Morgan Cox made the tackle  And let's hope 
[00:56:30]  The cribs is okay  Morgan Cox is the long  Oh my god  Spun him around  Oh boy  Did he just go down  They fumbled  What a bum  So he got knocked out  Cold is what this is  No injuries  But I heard they started praying  And all sorts of shit  Yeah I mean  Anytime there's  A helmet to helmet  Collision like that  Look at the back of his head  Hit the ground  Slam  Wham  Ow  That's a bad  That's a concussion  Right there 
[00:57:00]  That's a bad concussion  Give him a conclusion  Of the brain  See look  They're all just  I hate when they all pray  They're all Tebow  They're ripping off Tebow  I hate when they  It's this public  It's nonsense  They're all praying  And they're whispering  Their prayers  You see their lips moving  Terrible ontriloquist  How long was he down  A couple minutes  I mean  They gotta be careful  Taking somebody off the field  Like that  Yeah pick him up 
[00:57:30]  And fucking pick him up  By his bootstraps  Walk it off  We got a game to play  Yeah  Get up  That's it  You bum  I'm paying for this  Put you up by your bootstraps  Bootstraps  And then he got up  And he even  He even smiled  As he was walking off the field  I read  Yeah good  He's got time for smiles  Do your fucking job  You like when the players  Get carted off  And they give the thumbs up  How did you become 
[00:58:00]  The bitter one  I'm very confused by that  How did you become  The bitter one  Well I  What happened  I  Let me think  Obama  Was that the catalyst  To the whole thing  Yeah I think that was  Yeah  That was pretty much it  Did you  It's just quick  Maybe Travis knows  Probably not though  Did you hear about this  Baseball player  That had  That had one pitch  In the majors  I love this story  This is great  Why do you love this story 
[00:58:30]  It's a weird story  Well yeah it's a weird story  Was he  Was he a good prospect  Was he going to be  An average major leaguer  Or a good major leaguer  He wasn't anything special  You got this guy right  Back in 2004 or 5  I think  2005 I think  Yeah  And first at bat  In the majors  I saw the clip  Oh man  And one pitch  Fucking hilarious  Oh no  Chip  Tragic  One pitch  92 mile an hour  Fastball  Hits him in the fucking head  His career is done  He saw one pitch 
[00:59:00]  In the majors  He saw one pitch  The first pitch  He's the only person  In major league history  To only have  One pitch  Right  Like he doesn't have  An official at bat  Because when you get hit  That's not in the bat  Does he have a baseball card  With the stats on the back  Yeah  Yeah  Which is zero  It's just nothing  One at bat  So then he stays around  With this bad concussion  He was around on the team  The next year  But never played  Yeah he stuck around  In the minors  He was in the  Independently  Yeah then they threw him  Down in the minors  Then he played for  Four or five minor league teams 
[00:59:30]  And then that was it  So why are they  Bringing him back  Well  Is he good enough  To come back into the majors  No this is just  One of these feel good things  This is a one day contract  It's a Rudy thing  Yeah the Marlins  Sign him to a one day contract  He played for the Cubs  One day contract  So he will play  On October 2nd  Against the Mets  Is that the last game  Of the season or something  No  It's the next last game  You're selling tickets  Give him a two day contract  Yeah right  Yeah really  What the fuck  Yeah  Full benefits  Let him stick around  For the weekend 
[01:00:00]  Jesus  He's getting all his dental work  That night after the game  Yeah  Because he has one day  Of benefits  One day  Standing here  On the pitcher's mound  So you'll assume  This is a story  About baseball  But it is more  Than just that  It's a story  About second chances  And who among us  Doesn't wish  We could have  A second chance  It's not  It's not a second chance  I hate these stories  Trying to make it  So feel good  You don't think  He's going to hit  A home run  And they get so  When you allow  Wheelchair guy  To score a touchdown  It's dumb  Wheelchair guy  To score a touchdown  Remember that story 
[01:00:30]  Was there a wheelchair  On that one  There's always  All the defenders  Are just standing there  With sticks  To put in his spokes  At the line  Where they all stop  And allow it to happen  I hate that shit  There's got to be  A better way to do that  Is all I'm saying  I'm not cold hearted  But it just seems fake  It's two teams  That are completely out of it  It's the Marlins  And the Mets  So I want to be in the majors  Yeah  When I was a kid  When I was a kid  Playing Little League  I'm like wow  You know what  I like to be in the majors  So how about a team  Hires me for one day  Why not  He should have his agent  Go in there  And demand more money  For his one day contract 
[01:01:00]  This is Travis State  I demand  Twelve million dollars  I don't get it  What if they just  Intentionally walk him  And he still doesn't  Have an official at bat  That'd be great  Plus he fucks  Walk him around  Plus he fucks up his stats  Because he'll get it back  All for one  He just wants it at bat  For what reason  There was like  There was an online  Documentary that was made  A couple months ago  I don't think this  But  But  Wouldn't you want  Another chance at the majors  Because you were good enough  To be in the majors  Sure  But he sounds like 
[01:01:30]  He's not good enough  No he's so far from that  He's shit  Yeah it's not gonna happen  So are they gonna let  Are they gonna allow him  Are they gonna throw  A 70 mile fastball  So he's gonna hit  Well first of all  R.A. Dickey is pitching  So he's not gonna see any  R.A. Dickey  20 wins baby  The only positive  For the fucking Mets  This year  How did he get 20 wins  Because he's  Horrendous team  Every win  Really good  I'm sure he'll get  Something tossed in there  He'll probably throw it  Underhand  Yeah  That's stupid  I'd be embarrassed  Well 
[01:02:00]  Why is he doing this  He's hoping for that  One shot  You know what  Like I can't  Speak for him  But like  He just wants  I can  Ow  Where am I  What happened  What am I doing  What team is this  I got stuck  In the minors  Yeah  The doorbell rang  And they clenched up  And got nervous  Nervous  It was stuck  In them  I'm like  Get off me  Timothy  I gotta get 
[01:02:30]  The door  Wow  It sounded like  A window cling  Coming off  Lift them up  By the buddocks  You've got the audio  Of this guy  Trying to do a story  Look at his dreck  His baseball story  He's out there  On the mound  With his shirt sleeves  And his slacks  And a baseball cap  He's ready to go  That's the sound you hear  It's the ball  He's throwing the ball  Into the gloves  Yeah  Yeah  It's a baseball story  Here it is  Yeah  It's more than that  Field of dreams 
[01:03:00]  More than just a hit  To the head  If you build it  They will collapse  Drew Liger  His professional career  With the Chicago Cubs  In 2005  Started  And ended  His first time at bat  They don't even have  Video of it  Sure they do  I've seen the video  So why would they  Show the video  They probably don't  Have the right  The news doesn't  Have the rights  Rebroadcasting  Yeah if you go  To YouTube  Let's watch it  On YouTube  How worthless  Well we want to  See the whole story  But yeah we can  See the  Yeah I'm curious  About that clip  92 miles an hour 
[01:03:30]  To the head  It was bad  Was it intentional  Or no  No  Do you remember this  When it happened  No  No  I don't know  This is the short  Documentary  Jesus  We just want to see  I just want to  Watch him take a  Plunk  Oh my god  Oh my  Yeah that's fine  That's all his teammates  Laughing at him  Ha ha  He's ruined  He's ruined  How about a full screen  Too  Come on Sam  For the fuck's sake  What are we watching  On teeny TVs  Am I right guys  You're right  You're right  Sammy  Way to make a point  Young man 
[01:04:00]  Do you remember the  Well yeah I mean  I gave him a call  A pinch hit  Adam Greenberg  Dusty Baker  Making his major  July 9th 2005  Dramatic  And here's Greenberg  Oh fuck  He got hit in the head  On the very first pitch  Bam goes down  You can hear the thud  All across the ballpark  All across the ballpark  Ah shit  Back of the head  I grabbed my head  Instantly  Because I really felt  Like I was holding  It together 
[01:04:30]  This was before  Concussions  Became a major story  In sports  Back then  A concussion  No one really  Thought twice about it  The vertigo  Greenberg  I had vision issues  My vision needed to be corrected  My equilibrium was off  Everyone dreams of getting in the batter's box  As a major league  Alright so  That's terrible  That's the whole documentary  Which  People say is a really good documentary  Yeah it's great  And this thing  It's called  One at bat  Or something like that  If you want to check it out for yourself  Alright here's the  Go back a little bit  Because now he's talking 
[01:05:00]  Do you know who hates this?  The guy who's in the major leagues  He got hit on his second at bat  Overshadowed yes  Yeah by one pitch guy  My helmet  Right behind my ear  So my helmet flew off  And I felt my head explode  In an instant  A career that had just begun  Was over  Which is horrible  It was the single most  Happiest  Greatest moment of my life  Matched with the  Absolute worst thing  At the exact same moment  Now 
[01:05:30]  Seven years later  He wears a night outfit  When he backs  This center fielder  Who on and off for years  You mean to barely stand  Without falling over  A night outfit  Is again  Fucking Jimmy  A night outfit  It's third grade Jimmy  I love his characters  Yeah  Oh third grade Jimmy  I think it's third grade Jimmy  Is that what we figured out?  How fast was the pitch that hit him?  92  Wow  I knew in the middle of that  I was being set up 
[01:06:00]  There you go  All like he once did  He looks like he has skills  He kept himself in shape  At 31 years old  He sharpened his skills  Playing for the Israeli National  Go  I'm just kidding  I still hold on to the childhood dream  Of a career in the bigs  Adam was hit by a 92 mile an hour fastball  Enter Matt Liston  More than just a passionate baseball fanatic  I want to create an army  An army of fans  To help me  Get Adam  Looks like Tarantino  If he was retarded  Seven minutes 
[01:06:30]  Yeah yeah  We're done  We're done with this  So the fact is  He's gonna  He's gonna get another  Matt Liston  Yeah on Tuesday  I want to tell you something  That's his name  It's Matt Liston  I get it  Yeah  Liston  A secret  Jesus  Play with the Israeli league  That's creepy  I've never heard of that  Play wherever you want 
[01:07:00]  Wherever  Don't take it  How great is it gonna be  If he gets up again this week  And the guy brushes him off  Oh jeez  I wonder what kind of pitch  They're gonna throw him  They're probably just gonna throw him  Fastballs down the middle  They're probably gonna give him  Something to hit  He'll get something  Just tossed into him  You think so?  I think so  Yeah  Nobody's taking this seriously  To begin with  It's weird man  If it makes me cold hard  So be it  It just seems strange  I don't mind this story  As much as I  Mind those wheelchair stories  That you talk about 
[01:07:30]  I don't know  I mean  They give him the football  And he's wheeling down the field  I don't mind that in high school  That was so wacky  That's weird  All that stuff's weird to me  At a professional level  It's one thing  But in high school  It really is meaningless  Oh you have to  Treat everybody nicely  Well I think the lesson  Of compassion you learn  For somebody  Whose whole life  Is gonna be this one moment  Shitty right?  Yeah  Oh boy  I mean this is  A moment that for him  Is gonna be  That doesn't bother me  When the retard scores  It's like ah  But let him  You know what I mean 
[01:08:00]  I get it  I hope this guy  You know what I mean  When they let their  Down syndrome  Trudge down the field  It does make you feel good  I hope this guy  Strikes out so bad  He hurts his back  Just really swinging  For the fences  At least throw him  Real fucking pitches  Or he strikes out so hard  That the bat goes  Behind him  And hits him  Exactly where the pitch  Hit him  Oh that poor bastard  It'll sell tickets  That's wrestling  That's what wrestling  Gets criticized for 
[01:08:30]  You're not supposed to  Do things in real sports  Because it sells tickets  Let me tell you  I'm gonna hit that ball  Give the referees  Entrances  And put the cripples  Out on the mountain  Oh my god  He was hitting the head  It's ridiculous  It's not supposed  To happen in sports  You guys wanna talk  About Lil Wayne  What happened with Lil Wayne  Young Wheezy  Well there's a couple  Things happening  With Lil Wayne  Guess who  He just passed on  The billboard chart  Is it billboard officially  Yeah  The billboard charts 
[01:09:00]  Of all time  The Beatles  Elvis  He just passed Elvis  Yeah  Lil Wayne has more hits  Than Elvis  Wow  He snuck it through though  Because he's featured  On all those songs  That's true  How is that possible  Featured  Because he's on every song  So it's like featuring  Lil Wayne  And they give him credit  For every song  How many hits has he had  Over a hundred  A hundred and eight  Come on  I think Elvis had a hundred and eight  And Lil Wayne has a hundred and nine  That's crazy  Isn't that unbelievable  That's craziness  We're finally getting  To the Lil Wayne tape  Young Money 
[01:09:30]  Lil Wayne deposed  By Quincy Jones III  His attorney  Right  He doesn't take  The legal process  Very seriously  Why not  Well he doesn't take  Much seriously  But they put out  This documentary  That I think  Anthony you saw  Yes I did see that  I think it was called  The Carter  But it's hilarious  You liked it right  What made it so good  Because it's Lil Wayne  Being Lil Wayne  It's fucked up  Is what it is  Ridiculous  He started  Because he's drinking  Cough syrup the whole movie  Yeah  And  He drinks cough syrup  He had a terrible  Addiction to it 
[01:10:00]  Yeah yeah yeah  Sizzurp  Yeah  Sizzurp  That's what  You put like  Prescription strength codeine  Yeah  And then you mix it with  Soda and Jolly Ranchers  And Jolly Ranchers  And that's what  You know  Syrup is  Oh  Okay but it's not just  Cough medicine  It's mixed with  It's mixed with  Yeah like Mountain Dew  And Jolly Ranchers  He's using it like a liqueur  The Cody one  Yeah prescription strength codeine  That probably gets you  Fucking  Zooded  Zooded  I would have imagined  It's right  Yeah  Yeah and he starts  Like he's in the studio  In one scene 
[01:10:30]  Talking about  How he lost his virginity  When he was like 11  Fucking some chick  That some other rapper  Got him  Amazing  It really is a  Pretty cool story  Would you interview him  If you could  Oh my god  I would love to  I would love to interview  Lil Wayne  Would you call him  Your nigga  No  Unless Hooket was in the room  And then  The Hooket's there  I test the waters  A little bit  You gotta pass  I hear you  I would like to interview him  Because he did Iron Man  On that award show  He likes rock too right  Yeah he's always  He's tried  Especially in the last  Several years  He's tried to 
[01:11:00]  Merge into the  White people scene more  You know what I mean  His rock stuff is terrible  But  Yeah I'll tell him  You said that  When are you interviewing him  He's a fan  Of yours  Yeah  Wow  Did you read his eyes  Of course I did  Okay  Alright  He's a fan  No he's not a fan  Your eyes are too wide  You are  Lil Wayne likes me  He does  Your eyes are too wide  He has no clue  Who you are  Lil Wayne likes me man  He does  Now he's closing his eyes  Now I might believe you  You gotta start wearing shades  So what 
[01:11:30]  He didn't like the documentary  How about curtains  He didn't like the documentary  He gave permission to do the documentary  And they were following him around  For like a year  This is when the Carter 3 came out  Which was the album of his  That was enormous  Right  He didn't do  He wouldn't do an interview  With the documentary crew  They followed him around  But he just wouldn't sit down  With them and do it  Then the documentary comes out  And he sees it  And he sees he's drinking  Cough syrup the whole time  And he says  Well no this doesn't represent me  I don't want this coming out  And they're like 
[01:12:00]  No well you signed off  It's coming out  It is coming out  Right  And so now  He's suing  He filed a lawsuit against them  Right  And this is  The attorney for  Quincy Jones the 3rd  Who made the movie  Right  Deposing him  So he's  Quincy Jones' son  He's suing  Or yeah  Whatever  Quincy Jones  I guess  Or grants a word  Yeah  So Lil Wayne was deposed  And everyone's talking about this audio  He's just a  Well the thing about Lil Wayne  Is he doesn't give a fuck  He don't give a fuck  He's Elvis  So 
[01:12:30]  Do you recall being  At all concerned  About any criminal actions  That may have been  Pending against you  At the end of 2008  I don't recall  Do you recall that  In the summer of 2007  You were arrested  In New York City  Following a performance  At the Beacon Theater  I don't recall that  Do you recall that  Police in New York City  Discovered a  40 caliber pistol  On you  On your person  I don't recall

[01:16:30]  You have to wait  Until the attorney  Is finished  Asking the question  Please  I'm sorry  That's my psychic  I'm sorry  My psychic  He's pointing to his mind  Like he has psychic abilities  Psychic ability  Lil Wayne is so big though  Because it's also  It's not only Lil Wayne  But Nicki Minaj and Drake  Are also on his  Like those are his artists  Oh man  And those are like  The other two biggest rappers  Why can't he just like  Live life there  He's probably doing very well right  Yeah he's got millions and millions 
[01:17:00]  And millions of dollars  Yeah he doesn't give a fuck  If he loses the lawsuit  I don't know  But he might get sued  For legal fees  But I'm sure he doesn't care  About that  Because he's like  Wasting everybody's time  He doesn't care about anything  He doesn't give a fuck  I don't know  How old is he  27  He's 30  I don't know  I think he just turned 30  I don't know  I don't know  Yeah he is a cool guy to talk  He's a cool dude  You have to love that  He's the man  So he's reached old age  I don't know  I don't know  A black rapper  That's old  30  Yeah  I mean  That's old age  Jay-Z is 40  And he's still doing it  Oh gee  Yeah but he sold out 
[01:17:30]  He didn't sell out  Lil Wayne  He bought in  Lil Wayne didn't sell out  As much as Jay-Z  Tell you what he sold out  He sold out fucking Barkley  There you go  Jay-Z didn't sell out  He bought the stadium  Yeah  I don't know  I want to go see Jay-Z  How do I make that happen  Oh my god  You want to take something  You want to borrow something from me  You want to go there  To see Jay-Z  Fuck no  I want to see Jay-Z  Totally safe  Oh I know  I want to see Jay-Z  How do I make that happen  I don't know  Can I tell you something  Yeah  Roland told me at my wedding  That my wedding present was 
[01:18:00]  That he was going to get me tickets  To Jay-Z at the Barclays  And a meet and greet  There's been no following  That  He fucking lied  Why would he lie to you  Was he drunk  Like  I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you  He wasn't drunk  I think that was his intention  Yeah  He's got a lot of intentions  Yeah  I don't think he can make it happen  Roland means well  I know he did mean well  Yeah yeah yeah  You sure he didn't say  Did you see that bar of clay  Cause he would be like  Jay-Z at Barclay  Jay-Z at Barclay  Roland truly believes in his head 
[01:18:30]  That he could make that happen  Yeah  So let's see what happens  Lil Wayne continues  Isn't it something  That you would remember  If your album  The Carter 3  Was the biggest selling album  Of the year  In 2008  Isn't it something  That I would remember that  Yes  Isn't that a personal opinion  Type question  Cause  That's why I got that  I mean  Cause I would be actually  Answering the question  To isn't it something 
[01:19:00]  That's my question  Isn't it something  That you would remember  Isn't it something  That's the question  I have to answer  Yeah  Isn't it something  Do the best  Trying to answer it  Yeah  It's something  Out of your ass  That's my answer  Something out of your ass  Yeah  It is something  Out of your ass  Wow  Something out of your ass  Oh  He just doesn't  Give a shit  Nah  It's Wayne  Why is he doing  He just hates 
[01:19:30]  These documentary makers  I guess  Well he hates  Is it in his best interest  To answer this shit  Of course it is  Which guy is that  That's talking to him  Yeah that's the  That's Quincy Jones  The third's attorney  Oh that's why  Okay  Yeah  Anybody who asserts  Any type of authority  Over him  You know what  Lil Wayne is great  To stand for  But he has no reason  To answer all those  Questions that were asked  Why  What does that have to do  With the case  It's a deposition  I mean yeah  So in a way  You know  You gotta love Lil Wayne  Fuck those guys  Because it has nothing  To do with the case  I don't know 
[01:20:00]  Two more questions  Lil Wayne doesn't give  Appropriate answers to  Yeah  Clearly  Lil Wayne  Answers to no one  Is that an interview  That you actually gave  With Katie Couric  Is that an interview  That I actually gave  With Katie Couric  Yeah  What's your name again  Oh god  Well that's not  The question  Pete Ross  Huh  Pete Ross  Pete Ross  That's a stupid ass 
[01:20:30]  Question  You just saw me  On there  Giving an interview  With her  Okay  So that was you  I'd say  Did you perform it  I'd say  Yeah  It's a stupid ass  Question  Because you're giving  Me stupid ass  Answers  Yeah  He turned to the  Judge  Wait are you  Mad at Lil Wayne too  What's his name  You can't be mad  No he's right though  That was a stupid  Question  The guy saw me  Give me the interview  Why are you asking  Because he was  Giving stupid ass answers  But the guy  Now the guy's  Kind of trying to  Get back at him  A little  Do you recall  Winning the Grammy  How's that fucking 
[01:21:00]  No  No  I bet that question  Would not have come up  If he didn't keep saying  I don't know  I don't know  Because then it's like  Alright I gotta start  Asking him things  That he would  Absolutely know  To kind of show  That he's just  Not answering  But that's stupid  On the attorney's part  Because Lil Wayne's  Gonna continue  You're not gonna  Change him  No  That's obvious  At this point  It's a strategy  By the attorney though  That if he just  Asks him the pertinent  Questions  And Lil Wayne  Says I don't know  It can be interpreted  That he just doesn't  Know  If you ask him  Shit that he  Absolutely would know 
[01:21:30]  And he still says  I don't know  Then you're showing  People that he's  Just being  Fucking combative  Why didn't the attorney  Say something like  Is it true  They call you  Lil Wayne  Would he say  I don't know  About that  I bet the  They call me  A bunch of things  Is it true  That's a stupid  Ass question  You think the attorney  Wants to strangle him  He's so frustrated  He knows he's just  Never gonna get  Through to this guy  You know how much  The West Memphis  Three wishes  They had Lil Wayne  With them  Instead of Jesse  Miss Kelly  Confessing to the cops 
[01:22:00]  Wayne would have  Been like  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  What the retarded boy  Said  Yeah  Let me tell you  Something about  Damien Eccles  That book  I should have read it  Before he got here  I'm only 20 pages in  Holy fuck  Unbelievable right  He's an amazing writer  Great writer  Independent of what  Happened to him  He's just a great writer  Holy fuck  We're gonna have to  Discuss that book  When I get through it  Because there's a lot  Of stuff in there  Yeah  Life After Death  By Eccles  It's a tremendous book  You read the part  Where the one guy  They did put him to death 
[01:22:30]  Another prisoner obviously  And he left him  His glass eye  Oh right  Holy fuck  And then he left  What his fake leg  To the other guy  Or something  Yeah  Yeah  Oh no  A hairpiece  Fake leg  What did they execute  A fucking head  It was definitely  A glass eye  That he left behind  From Damien Eccles  Was that the guy  That had one tooth  Yeah  There's one guy  With one rotted tooth  Yeah  Holy fuck  I highly recommend this book  And I'm only 20 pages in  But Jimmy also  Highly recommend it  Yeah I finished it 
[01:23:00]  I loved it  And you read it  In like a couple days  Yeah  Alright back to this  Sorry  That was you  Did you perform  At the Virgin Mobile Music Fest  In 2008  With Kanye West  I don't know  But I know I did perform  At this badass bitch  Birthday party recently  She was crazy  Stupid dick  Crazy  Let me  Could you read

[01:24:00]  Especially like  Teenage white girls  Oh stop it  Now you're just  Trying to get my goat  You know who didn't love  Lil Wayne  My ex-girlfriend  She said he just  Looks dirty  And he makes her  Feel dirty to look at him  Who the one that  Usually  Texts fun stuff  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Jimmy just goes  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  She's hilarious  She was very funny  And did not have  The most racially diverse  Opinence  No  No  That'll stop that  But yeah  And young white girls  Like that  His concerts are full 
[01:24:30]  Of the young white girls  Go crazy for him  They all know the lyrics  To the songs  Of course they do  Most of his songs  Are about him getting  His dick sucked  I think he even sucked a lot  A lot  All the time  All the time  Oh man  Let's play the last clip  Where Lil Wayne  Kind of threatens  The attorney  How would you describe  Your image in the media  How would I describe  My image in the media  Yes  I wouldn't describe it  Well how would you 
[01:25:00]  Describe it  If you had to  I don't have to  Well what image  Are you portraying  In the media  I don't portray anything  I am who I am  And you guys portray  What you get  No who are you  Who is the real  I am Dwayne Michael  Carter Jr.  Okay  Do you  Like to portray yourself  As  I just answered that  And said that  I don't like to portray  Myself as nobody  Okay  I completely be  Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. 
[01:25:30]  I don't portray myself  As anything  An image is self-described  Well you have to wait  Till I'm done with the question  I don't have to wait  To anything honestly  I mean  This guy right here  May tell me  That I have to wait  But personally  I don't have to do nothing  Go ahead and ask the question  Thank you Your Honor  This guy right here  Would you like to  Save you right  In the real world  That guy right there  He can't save you  In the real world  Just so you know  What does that mean  I don't have to elaborate  Is that 
[01:26:00]  Ask your next question  Is that a threat  Against  Mr. Cross  Mr. Cross  Can you just ask  Your next question please  He can't save you  And what does that mean  I was talking to myself  He's a man  I told you guys  He just turned me  What a fucking asshole  He's great  He's a fucking man  You think he likes white people  I think he likes white people's money 
[01:26:30]  I don't think he hates white people  I think that's  He hates white people  He's talking to a lawyer  Exactly how every one of us  Would like to address a lawyer  Like a piece of shit  I agree  He hates authority figures  He likes white people  Who like him  If they're like  Oh you're the shit  Then he'd be like  Yeah what's up  But if somebody came up to him  And was like  Let me tell you something  Lil Wayne  He'd be like  Fuck you  Think he has people  With guns around him  All the time  Yeah  Yes  Quite frequently  I'm sure he does  Was he a suburban guy  Or was he a thug coming up 
[01:27:00]  No he was a thug coming up  He grew up like poor in New Orleans  Oh okay  Oh jeez  Katrina wiped out his neighborhood  Okay  What was his  He started rapping when he was like 13  Okay  Oh he says 30  Okay  But yeah  I mean I think he grew up in like the projects  In New Orleans  Sure  So he's from a rough film  Yeah  Of course  Started rapping with Birdman  How's his father?  Lil Wayne?  Yeah  Well Birdman adopted him when he was a teenager  Because he didn't have 
[01:27:30]  Oh that must have been tragedy  Did his father die on stage?  Some kind of job related accident?  He didn't have a strong father figure  In his life  Oh wow  Yeah  God that's so odd  It is kind of a weird story  Yeah  But that's just kind of how that worked out  What about his mom?  I don't know much about his mom either  He didn't  Hmm  Again it was more you know  Birdman helped him out  Birdman  Oh god  You um  Jesus Christ  Wow you know we're all into music right?  It's nothing like my daddy 
[01:28:00]  Are we done with the Lil Wayne?  That was pretty good  Yeah you gotta love Lil Wayne  They're uh  Our pals at uh  BuzzFeed  Who now do a show here  At SiriusXM right?  Yeah  BuzzFeed has a show  How is it?  Is it alright?  Yeah  Um  They just posted something called  Twelve Extremely Disappointing Facts  About Popular Music  Hmm  Holy fuck  It goes with  I guess they did this because of Lil Wayne  Having more um  Chart hits than uh 
[01:28:30]  Elvis  And that  That was depressing  Well  I think it made BuzzFeed uh  You know do a little article  On uh  Other  Fucking  Disappointing Facts  About Popular Music  Do you have it up there?  I got  Someone just linked me but  Maybe it's not  Is it brand new?  It's not on  No it has seven  Fucking million views  This  This poster  Whoa  7.2 million views  For this poster  Oh is it that picture I tweeted  Of myself and Cal Burnett?  I don't think so  Something else  Yeah  Might be old  Maybe that's why this guy sent me 
[01:29:00]  Because we are talking about this shit  Uh  There you go  Alright look at this  Look at some of these  Creed  What happened  Jimmy you alright?  He's on telephone  Oh  He's got a little phone call  I don't know what you're saying  So you're speaking a foreign language  You have the wrong number  Aight  Jesus  Aight  This is really fast  Then we're gonna get Bob Kelly  And Frank Caliendo  In here  This is called 
[01:29:30]  12 Depressing Music Facts  The first one  Creed  Has sold more records in the US  Than Jimi Hendrix  Oh  With arms wide open  Makes sense  Number two  Zeppelin R.E.M. and Depeche Mode  Have never had a number one single  Rihanna has had 10  Ah  They didn't do Umbrella  Uh  Kesha  Kesha TikTok right  That dumb fucking simple song  That was out about two years ago  I think at this point  Yeah  Sold more copies than any Beatles single 
[01:30:00]  Wow  That's a little weird  It's deserved though  She was wonderful  And for how bad they say  The record industry is  As far as sales  And what not  Digital delivery is so much easier  You just have to go to the record store  And buy a single  And stuff  And you know  Now people are  And especially  In the oldie days  You weren't getting a lot of people  In those upper demos  Going to the record store  So you think  This is not fair  Because of the digital thing  Yeah yeah 
[01:30:30]  It is  It's so much easier  There's more people alive today  More people  Than there were then  Right  Guy who just gets angry  At a point for no reason  Yes  Me again  We didn't have impulse buying  When we were  No  We had to get in a fucking car  When we had an impulse  You had to go to your mom and dad  And say  Hey how about a buck  And they'd say  Do you know the value of a buck  I don't know what's going on  I'm not sleeping with my apnea machine  And I'm trying  I'm sitting on the couch  For an hour at a time  Breathing terribly 
[01:31:00]  I'm going to film you  And your mask  Fucking horrendous life  Flo Rida's Lowe  Has sold 8 million copies  The same as the Beatles  Hey Jude  Lowe was a catchy song  But I think Ann makes a really good point  Ann's really good at fucking stats  And facts and shit  Because you're right  It was so much harder  To buy Hey Jude in its heyday  Yeah  You had to go out to a record store  And if you got in a traffic jam  You turned around and said  Fuck it  Yeah  Now it's like  I like that song 
[01:31:30]  Bink  Click on your phone  It's bought  How does that song go Lowe  Oh man  Hey Jude  Not that one  Sorry  This is a cool song  It's no hey Jude  Wait till it kicks in  It's about to kick in  Then you might change your mind  Alright  Let me start talking about  Apple bottom jeans  There you go  Jimmy's cursing his lips  I hate when he does that  Her  The her 
[01:32:00]  Yeah this is the her one  Oh Jimmy's doing his dance face  Yeah this sounds like music we would hear in Brazil  I mean even though this was just a  Really?  Yeah  This reminds me of the whorehouse music that you would hear all the time  Oh  I like this song  Yeah it's fine  What do you like about this or hey Jude?  Hey Jude  Probably  Black Eyed Peas  I got a feeling  Yeah  That was a huge fucking hit for them  Yep  More popular than any Elvis or Simon and Garfunkel song 
[01:32:30]  Wow  Yeah  But you know what  I'm done with this list in a way because of what you said  Yeah  The impulse buying it just makes it so much easier  Celine Dion's Falling Into You sold more copies than any Queen Nirvana or Bruce Springsteen record  Same as Shania Twain's Come On Over  Katy Perry holds the same record as Michael Jackson for most number one singles from an album  What?  Whoa  She just made it 
[01:33:00]  Yeah I think her last album  Her last album was as popular as Thriller  She had a ton of number one singles  But look at those tits  Yeah  She probably didn't sell as many copies of the album  No she definitely did  But she had the same number one singles  That's another thing  You could just buy the singles  Pick and choose my friends  What's a big song by her?  Fire  Fire  Fireworks  There's so many big songs that she did  I kind of like this song  Is that bad?  What makes you think?  It doesn't make me think  I don't know this song 
[01:33:30]  I've never heard this  It's inspirational  What is this song about?  I don't even know  I just know it's catchy  It's about when you're low  Picking yourself up and realizing that you're  That you married an asshole  Yeah  Picking yourself up by your bootstraps  That's what it's about  I like when it kicks in  Is it bad to like this one?  You like this Jimmy?  No  You'll know  Right here  Oh yeah  We're going to a place with this song  Taking it one notch  We're building still baby 
[01:34:00]  We're building  Here we go  There it goes  Baby you're a firework  Come on show them where you're worth  Make them go  Oops  You don't like it Jimmy?  It's okay  Let me hear another one about her after this  I don't know her music  You really don't know Katy Perry?  I know she is  It's everywhere  I like I kissed a girl  Teenage dream  You like to say it or no?  It's catchy 
[01:34:30]  But she's not a cup of tea  She's not anywhere near as good as Lady Gaga is  No she's not  For the record  You know there's a guy that I do respect  Who's friends with Wheeze  Who's on tour with Chris Daughtry  As his backup singer  Gary Glitter?  Oh  LVO  He's on Twitter  He blew up with Chris Daughtry  He wrote one of the songs on the new album and stuff  He's a good friend of ours  He said he saw Lady Gaga 
[01:35:00]  And he tweeted last night  He said he's seen a shitload of fucking shows in his years  And he said nothing comes close to what a Lady Gaga show  She's great  She's amazing  And I was like fuck really?  You gotta see her live  He's gay?  Is that what it is?  Is he gay?  No no no  Stop it  I'm implying that anyone that would say that would have to be  He said he was blown away  I gotta try to find the tweet  I'm like really?  He said better than any show he's ever seen  It's a really good show  Really good show 
[01:35:30]  Why though?  Why to that point where a guy like LVO would say that?  Because all of her songs are good  Because he's like a pop rock guy I think  All of her songs are good  She actually performs them  She doesn't lip sync  And she creates an entire show around them  And she's singing for real  It doesn't feel like a put on  It feels like she's actually doing a show  Wow isn't she?  Look at you  Gushing like a little fruit  What are some of these other music facts?  Barbra Streisand has sold more records  140 million  Wow  Than Pearl Jam, Johnny Cash, and Tom Petty combined  Johnny Cash only depressed them 
[01:36:00]  I don't care about Petty and Pearl Jam  Well Petty's had some hits  And Pearl Jam had a couple Monster Alums  Give me her memories  By who?  Johnny Cash?  Barbra Streisand  Oh the memories  Doesn't she sing memories?  Yes  It's a good song  Memories  Doesn't she do Evergreen too?  I don't know that one  That's the one  I mean  It's probably not  It's from E-Rock's favorite show  Cats  I love Cats  It's my show  Did E-Rock like Cats? 
[01:36:30]  No I did  That was you  I love Cats  I knew it was an idiot  What song is this?  This is from Cats  This is Memory  This is the one you brought up  Oh this is Memory  And it's not  Right  Yeah this is the one from Cats  Yeah  You were thinking of  What about Evergreen?  Memory  Oh yeah  Can we do Evergreen for our pal Paul Williams please?  He wrote the Evergreen with the Streisand  Memory from Cats is a great song  It's a stupid song  Just reminds you you're gonna die  Yeah well they remember what their balls were like before they were spayed 
[01:37:00]  That's not what it's about  Stupid cats  That's not what the song's about  I remember it was like the shit in the leaves instead of a litter box  It's not like  They don't mention that  This is a song Paul Williams wrote with Barbra Streisand  What's cool  Memories  Like the color to my mind  He does sing a person  Like the color to my mind  Memories  The way we were  He actually sings his version of this song  Does he?  It's gotta be terrible  Can we find Paul Williams doing Evergreen?  One  Love that it shared by  She can't belt out a fucking song though 
[01:37:30]  Yeah you gotta give it to the  Who was telling us the other day  You can't look at her though  Who was in here?  That said don't look at Barbra Streisand  It was uh  James Bolan  Stevie Van Zandt  Stevie Van Zandt  Yeah and he said that you know  I guess they didn't know  He was in Springsteen's band  Yeah  So yeah telling people to avert their eyes  Telling them to avert  Ugh  How to fucking treat her like Adriana  When he took her over to the woods  Do we have Paul Williams? 
[01:38:00]  I'm not seeing it in there  Do you have Paul Williams singing this on the internet?  What's the song called?  Evergreen  Yeah  Was that from the coke you think?  It  Well he was  He openly admitted that  He was  You know I never even thought of that  Alright turn yours down  Oh this is great  Now  Listen for the contrast  Oh no  This will be better  Yeah?  Yeah  The little fella  Oh jeez 
[01:38:30]  Tiny little fella  Oh  Oh  Hold on  Hold on  Here it comes  Love  Love  Love  Soft as an easy chair  Yeah  Yeah  Love  Here he goes  Here he goes  One love that is shared  One love that is shared  I have found 
[01:39:00]  With you  He wrote this fucking thing  That's good  Yeah he did  Motherfucker  He could write a hit song  Imagine being able to write a hit song like that  Sure  Just not being able to sing it  Oh man  I like this version  That would suck  Hers is better  It's not as bad as I thought it would be  But it's  There's a drop off  Go back to the BuzzFeed thing  It's no fucking viral video of an Apple store  Yeah  Exactly  It's not 3.3  No  Or a good boy phone 
[01:39:30]  Naughty boy phone song  Right  Sure  When we talk viral videos  Let's not forget about the trick shot basketball thing  The Opster got one  That's right  It's on its way  I could feel it  Oh boy  What's the last fact?  What's the next one?  Ah the stupid Billy Ray Cyrus  People actually bought Billy Ray Cyrus  His album  Some Gave All  What was that?  That wasn't the Achy Breaky Heart one was it?  I think it must have been  Yeah  Alright  20 million people bought that  More than any Bob Marley album  Well it was catchy man  And then the cast of Glee 
[01:40:00]  Has had more songs charted than the Beatles  That's bullshit though  Because they didn't write the songs  What?  Yeah  That's crazy  People just like their versions  They love their versions  Is that show still on the air?  Yeah  Still doing  Very popular  You fell into my trap  Oh shit  Ah ha  I swear I'm like  You fell into the trap  Yeah  You're supposed to say  I don't fucking know  Why don't you ask a chick?  Exactly  Come on Peter Pumper  What's the next fact?  Yeah let's go  I'm sorry  This guy sucks 
[01:40:30]  Or exists  Whatever  Justin Bieber  That's it  That's the number 12  Justin Bieber's harmless  He's just a dumb teen idol  With a soft tinny voice  He stinks now  In horrible dancing style  He's terrible now  Is he done?  He's gotta be  I don't know  Like girls are  Moving on  Older teens  Love him for nostalgia  Of their slightly younger teens  Oh boy  He stinks  Yeah his voice is not  You better have a good voice  To translate to adulthood  And he just doesn't  He's got the lifespan  Of a mosquito  Cause he's not a good singer 
[01:41:00]  This is a good song  No longevity with this guy  No  Because he designed the song  To sound like Justin Timberlake  But he doesn't have a good voice  Is Usher not taking his calls anymore?  You think?  Yeah  Is that Justin?  Yeah I'll get back to him  Talk to you later JB  When does it happen  Where Usher's bigger  Than Justin Bieber again?  Soon?  I don't know  Usher's up there too  But Bieber's still  Bigger for now  Wait the fondue line  Is it true  Justin Bieber's wife died?  Justin Bieber's wife died?  Mmhmm  I'm almost positive 
[01:41:30]  That that is not true  For several reasons  I don't know  Well he  There was this  This Uber  I'm embarrassed  I know this  Justin Bieber fan  She died of the  The cancer  Oh  Oh oh that girl  The kitten  Oh I know who you're talking about  And I think Justin Bieber  Playfully called her  His wife  I know who you're talking about  Did they consummate it?  I don't know  That's nice  Jesus  I think he would have been arrested  Because I think she was like six  Oh yeah  I don't know how old she was  Oh I know her  See

Yeah  When I talk  Yeah I cry  The move that bus 
[01:53:00]  Had me howling  Yeah  Yeah  Well that originated from the  Is that what your wife says  When she wants to put him on a couch?  It's better than what you say  Get it to the back of the bus  You racist  It started from the joke  When I was with Norton  And we were watching the midgets  And the other midget  Proposed to the other midget  And the midget started crying 
[01:53:30]  And she couldn't wipe her tears  That's where that comes from  And I started crying  Because I just felt bad  For the little midget  That couldn't wipe her own tears  Because  Her T-Rex arms  Can we find that Eric please?  And it just made me cry  Because  You start  When you start hanging with your wife  More than your fucking savage  Creepy asshole friends  They watch such emotional  Real stuff on TV  With such  Oh my god  Behind it  You know  Like it's real  Like these people are  Just fucking hurting in life  And I'm watching  You know  Someone  You know 
[01:54:00]  Some dirty jobs  You know  Cleaning out a sore  You know  And it just opens me up  Dude  I cry  Anything with little kids  Midgets  Puppies  My wife's into  Honey Boo Boo now  She just got  Destroyed my life  It's another program  She watches  And I have to leave the room  And just try not to think  Less of her  Yeah  Yeah  I just caught an episode  I was in for a couple weeks  And I'm like  Alright I've seen everything  The finale  Was the other night  Where  Yeah  Oh I need to know what happened  She has the kid 
[01:54:30]  And then they just talk about  What a great  With the two thumbs  Yeah the kid with two thumbs  Born with two thumbs  Of course  Why wouldn't it be  And yeah  They felt blessed about that too  They did  Right  Yeah  They were like  Making jokes  Of how they were giving the baby  A high six  And it was subtitled  So you knew what they were saying  They are subtitled  And I think they're speaking English  Some form  Some dialect  Well what was the cliffhanger  No real cliffhanger  The cliffhanger was  Are they going to get another season  Because they just kind of 
[01:55:00]  Talked about  They played some clips  From the entire season  And that was it  And Honey Boo Boo  Did a little fashion show  Thing there  Did she win?  No  She got some kind of title  Did it run out of steam  By the end  Or is there still going to be  It was running out of steam  Pretty much  That's what I saw  They'll get another season though  Maybe two seasons  It's big isn't it  It's like  Four million people watching it  But I haven't heard  As much about it lately  I think  First of all  The name Honey Boo Boo  People watch it  And then you're like  Alright they're just  Fat white trashy  And she has maggots in her feet  Alright we got it 
[01:55:30]  That's it  This is the clip  That made Bobby cry  Which is  The little midget's hand  Goes  Oh  It's so sad  Full screen  God damn you people  Without the full screen  Rewind it you cocksucker  You're ruining everything  Jesus you fucking prick  Holy shit  Make it a full screen  This whole thing  Is the quality full?  Hit the little gear  At the bottom right  It is  Birthday kind of stuff  Oh man  No the gear  Right there  Oh my god

[01:56:30]  Baby Godzilla got all excited  That's hilarious  Holy shit that was fucking great  I thought that was in my mind  I was like  I was so glad  He was like  Oh shit  That's great  Can we see that again  Iraq please  Oh fuck me  We'll put that on the Facebook page  That's hilarious  Oh that's fucking great 
[01:57:00]  Get that up there  There she goes  Look at that hand  You know what it is  They give awful hugs  Oh yeah  Let's give each other  A shoulder press  Non-hugging motherfuckers  But the move the bus thing  Gets you every time right?  Oh dude  I can't watch that shit  That move the bus  Is a motherfucker  You don't know move the bus?

Allelunium  Titanium  You have a  That's a wedding ring?  Yeah  It's a new thing  It's a little piece  Cut off of my leg  Titanium  Yeah my wife Susan 
[01:59:00]  My fat Asian wife Susan  Gave me this  That's his Gary Sinise impression  My fat wife Susan Forrest  She gave me this ring  For my finger  Since I don't have toes  Apparently all you gotta do  Is clench your teeth and talk  Forrest tell your wife  To stop coughing  Over the fondue  We're all gonna drop in  She's got AIDS Forrest  Yeah we got it  Gary Sinise  Forrest tell her  Not to put her toenails  By my feet  I'm afraid AIDS  Will get on my metal shoes  Can't find it E-Rock

Wow they don't  They don't want to  Move the bus  Clips up on live  Come on Norman  Get off me man  Oh man  Nice acting  He keeps touching my  Holding my hand Anthony  Nice acting  Can I see something  Over here  Where somebody  Fucking starts crying  Norton has creepy  Baby fingernails  Oh he pokes you  With them  Yeah like brand new  Fingernails  You know what I mean  Brand new  Like when a little  Baby gets fingernails  For the first time  Sure yeah  Yeah sure  Oh Jesus  Yeah those leave

Not really  It's actually cheaper than gold  Why did you go with something  That's black  That seems like  It's fucking like 
[02:00:30]  Tragic  And you know  Fucking  You're not  Thinking the marriage  Is gonna be  You know  Like golden  Like a golden ring  His gold looks tacky  You're concerned about that  Yeah  There you go  He's worried about  Gold looking tacky  Oh god  His shirt was  Hulk Hogan's shoes on them  I know  You're right  You fucking  Play with Legos  I think somebody's gonna cry  But it's not gonna be  From a video  Yeah yeah  Iraq might  He's been known to 
[02:01:00]  Get a little weepy  In here  When Opie said  That he was a little embarrassed  That he was  The number two hero  On his  I think it was  MySpace  At the time  Yeah  That's how far back  That goes  You want me to work out  Some voices  While you're  Oh yeah  There you go  We could bring in  Morgan Freeman  That's when the audience  Realize he'd never  Get anywhere  With this situation  Trying to figure out  What was about to happen  But the truth of the matter  Was  We were never gonna  See that clip  Bobby  My telecine 
[02:01:30]  The professional narrator  There it is  Once again  Looks like a little bit  Of B-roll  Yeah  It's another guy  With their camera  Forrest  Apparently  This is not  Professionally shot  Don't know where  They get the guy  Who does the actual show  But it's not gonna be heard  On the Opie and Anthony program  Ever  Ever  You know when I was young  He never would have been  Allowed to do movies  Oh jeez  Racist Gary Sinise  Take Jessica Tanda  The Piggly Wiggly 
[02:02:00]  Jiggaboo  Jessica Tanda  Jessica Tandy  Oh okay  She's stupid  Well we're not gonna find it  Son of a bitch  Let's get on  Get your hopes off the table  We got Frank Caliendo  In studio  Playing Levity live  Tonight and tomorrow  You still gotta do Bush  People are still  You know when I started out  With it  Just to get it out of the way  Cause they all want it  Yeah they do  I mean I used to do  I was doing  At one point  I was doing like  20 minutes  Of Bush  Up front 
[02:02:30]  Because that's what  People were  That and Madden  And the only time  You see John Madden now  Is the end of that  Prilotech OTC commercial  That Larry the Cable guy  That's like flipping your burgers  After the burn  Cut to John Madden  Available at Walmart  It's nothing like  The rest of the commercial  Like they shot it  Somewhere else  It's so ridiculous  It's like  Zapruder shot it  Or something like that  You're looking at it  Going this doesn't fit in  They're like  How'd they get him  To do this  And we want you  To do a commercial  I'm not going anywhere  Yeah  Alright well you can  Shoot at your home  I'll do it  What do you want me  To do  He doesn't fly 
[02:03:00]  But that's why  I started narrating  The jokes as Morgan Freeman  Because I always thought  It was funny  When a comedian  Would have to explain a joke  Because growing up  Watching that  That always made me laugh  So then John Caponera  You know who Caponera is  I've heard  He's a great comic in Chicago  He was a guy  Who just talked like this  You know  And he was like  He said to me  Do Madden  Explaining the jokes  So that was the big thing  Explain the jokes  And then with Madden  Not being seen much anymore  I got into that  Whole Morgan Freeman  That's when the audience  Realized that  That was supposed to be a joke 
[02:03:30]  The fact of the matter was  He had no idea  What was going on  And neither did the audience  At this point  Well  Let's figure out  That's him in every movie  Exactly  Every movie  Yeah right  Come on  But people do  It's funny  Because people will still  Do that  You're working on Romney  I don't work on  I don't work on a president  Romney's got to be tough  No  I think so  But he sounds sleepy  Is one of the things  I don't have the voice for him yet  But it's like  I work on it  I got a great John McCain  And nothing to do with it 
[02:04:00]  Oh man  John Lovitz is sitting at home  Going  I was Michael Dukakis  Nobody cares  My friend  That's my McCain  And I live in Arizona  We must do this together  My friend  But nobody cares anymore  That's going to suck  And with Obama  All I have now  Really is that he talks  Slow at the beginning  And speeds up at the end  Right  So he's like  One  Two  Three  Four  Five  Six  Seven  It's always that  That cadence  That seems to work  For just about everything 
[02:04:30]  We asked Daryl Hammond  This when he was in  Because his book  Was really interesting  And he talked about  When he wants to do a voice  He's  I mean Daryl's also  Certifiably insane  He's crazy  He sees colors  He says  He sees them as weird colors  That's how he sees  I see colors  I do a little thing  Where I see  How do you come to the voice  Do you see  I see the person in front of me  Like when I'm doing an impression  I see that person  It's like I'm looking in a mirror  And then it's almost like  Or I can almost look down  And see it  So that's why I'm so disappointed 
[02:05:00]  When I watch myself on television  I'm like  Oh I still look like me  Oh that sucks  That's really bad  You know  But I kind of see him  And then when I do the movement  It's almost like I'm mirroring  What I see  Looking down  Or it's like  It's weird  Because I can  I almost see the whole situation  How do you  You know I mean  You do tons  I just drink  A lot  And then it just comes out  Good, bad, or indifferent  I don't care  Right  I just say who it is  That's why it's like  And now  Ronald Reagan 
[02:05:30]  Yeah but you know what  That works for audiences  Especially because  If you don't set it up  People start getting the joke  At a different time  I think he's doing  Robin Williams  Oh is that what it is  Yeah  He's doing the  It also works that way  When you get a fucking contract  For fucking years  You show up  And get that check  I don't give a fuck  If it works  He has to actually  Perfect that show  And that's the truth  I have to get things good  Otherwise people are like  You suck at that  Yeah  Like that's why I'm trying  To work on more characters  And stuff like that  Because then 
[02:06:00]  But then people are like  Who's he doing  You know that's the thing  Oh man  You never want someone  To say who's he doing  Right  They come in  And it's not supposed  To be anybody  It's my neighbor Rick  Or something  And they're like  He doesn't sound famous  No  Because they don't live  In a famous neighborhood  Well because comics  We can go on stage  And work out a new bit  And it can fail  And it's not a big deal  Somebody separated me  From comics  No no  Wow  Because you're Bobby  That's hurtful  Bobby  Bobby  Bobby  Bobby  Bobby  He's rubbing my arm 
[02:06:30]  He really is  You mean a guy  Without a gimmick  I got it  No  Is that what you meant  No I love Frank  I think he's fucking  The best at what he does  Absolutely  You know  I say it anywhere  Right to your face  The best at what you do  I love what you do  The best at what you do  Yeah I can't think  Oh my god  I hope he's really trying  But what I'm trying to say  Is this  There are other people out there  Who do something harder  You can't go on stage  But I agree with him actually  On that  That's why it's so hard  For me to do regular  You can't go on stage  And just work out  A fucking character 
[02:07:00]  Because they're going to be like  What the fuck are you doing  That's true  You have to do it at home  Right  First  Like a magician  By yourself  Alone  Just like when you're a kid  Growing up  A magician can't go on stage  And work out a magic trick  And have a fail  The way I see  Is because there are impressions  I do that are better  Than other ones  And some that are worse  Obviously  Because that's how it works  But like  Setting it up  Is the most important thing  Like I've been watching  Herm Edwards  You guys  Football guys  Herm Edwards  Crazy people  They talk to themselves  Right  They have multiple voices  And they all disagree  With each other  Herm Edwards has three voices 
[02:07:30]  And they all agree  With everything each other  Has to say  So they'll be like  What do you think  Of Tim Tebow  Oh Tim Tebow  Is a good football player  Good football player  Good football player  Can't play quarterback  Oh no  Can't play quarterback  Can't play quarterback  Look at my socks  You know it's always  But you find a gimmick  Or not so much a gimmick  But a take on them  And then it only has to be  So good  I think  But that's writing the bit  That's where the bit comes from  If you capture them  In some kind of a visual way  As well  Or you capture a cadence  Right  What is one that you wanted to do 
[02:08:00]  And could never get  And will never get  Oh there's tons  I can't even do a good  Joe Pesci  I watch  I can't do it  Most people can't  Brewer's the only one  That does Pesci  What the fuck  Kind of people at A  The cocksuckers  See it's hard to do  Boston Pesci  That was terrible  That was an angry baby  Yeah  That was Josh Pesci  I can do like  Joe Pesci from  With Honors  Okay  You know  Hey Harvard  You know  I think that's a better  Joe Pesci though  Nobody does  You can't do it 
[02:08:30]  Because nobody can  It's one of those things  Where nobody laughs  It's like if you did  The real Bill Cosby  And it sounds like Bill Cosby  People are like  Yeah it's pretty good  But then you go  Hilarious  Sounds just like it  Meanwhile he never really did that  No  Like when I say  And that's what that's all about  Is John Madden  He never said that  He never said that  It's something I made up  But they  You know  People take  It takes on its own life  I do a very good Pesci  From JFK  Oh  Yes you do  I've heard that  He wants to be asked to do it  I wish you did a really good JFK 
[02:09:00]  Would you like to do it for everyone Jimmy?  I'm implying your head should blow up  Oh I thought he meant  He wanted me to make a really inspiring speech  About the moon landing  Oh  That was a fat joke in there  And Mr. Cod  No  That wasn't a fat joke  I don't know  There was one  No no  We're going to avoid that today  They defrapped me  See  Oh wow  Thank you  That's all I do  What about  He talks about cancer of the neck 
[02:09:30]  Cancer of the neck  I've had it for years  Sounding a lot like Gary Sinise  All of a sudden  They all kind of fit into that scene  Yeah I love it  Trust me  I know how it is  They all do start to sound the same  I do a bunch of voices myself  Oh well Jimmy  I don't do my stage  Yeah  Why not  You never do any of your characters on stage  No but I do  I mean I do celebrity impressions  I've always done them  Oh  What's your favorite?  Who cares  I do them all  And now Morgan Freeman is Jim Norton  I'd like to throw AIDS at you son 
[02:10:00]  You pissed me off that much  Now here's me being Gary Sinise  I'll be Morgan Freeman  I'm going to slap Denzel in the goddamn face  Whoa  Wow  You almost think it was him  That's why I want to give up  That's why I want to give up the business  Gotta be frustrating  Yeah I just  I worked on that for years  He did like that  Effortless  What was your show in Vegas?  What was the  I just did a one  Oh  Jimmy 
[02:10:30]  You had a Vegas run right Frank?  Yeah I did it a couple years  A couple years?  Yeah a year and a half  I think was  I think what it ended up being  Did that drive you nuts?  Yeah  Yeah I mean it's just  I'm sure money was good but  Yeah money was why I did it  I mean I'd never had the inkling to go and be a Vegas  You know a lot of people are like that's their dream is to be a Vegas  To me it was always like you're kind of done  So that's why I've been trying to regenerate  But you go there and people are just  Every night when you're there every night 
[02:11:00]  People have lost their houses  Their money  They've got nothing  Sometimes people are falling asleep  They've paid a hundred dollars to see you  And you just look at them in the front row  You know you're like  Oh wow  What are you going to do?  Casino comps are the worst right?  Yeah I mean that's the whole situation  I mean it can be fun too  But that was  What we did in that show was  I added a band to me  Because everybody likes the singing and stuff like that  I don't really do singing impressions  So we'd have like John Madden singing  You know  You lived your life like a quarterback in the wind 
[02:11:30]  I was kind of mocking Vegas  And the smart people would get it  And the dumb people are like  Oh you should sing more  What's he doing?  Why does  Is he going to do Garth Brooks?  He should do Garth Brooks  With a puppet  Well after Danny Gans died  I mean he was like the big musical impressionist  Yeah but then  You know  Terry Fader went into there  And the guy's beyond amazing  Is he better than what Gans did?  I never saw Gans live 
[02:12:00]  He was like  I think he's probably better than Gans  Was with a puppet too  And not moving his mouth  And you're watching  And you're going  And the female voices he can do  You just go  Because I can't really do that  Terry Fader  I never heard of him  Yeah he won America's Got Talent  Oh yeah he's really good  Amazing  He's really good  I'll probably get a text from him now  Thanks for mentioning me  I don't mean anything  Who does he do?  We should get a clip of him  Tons of stuff  I mean just all these  Someone find a clip of him  Get some  What's the female  There's a couple of women 
[02:12:30]  That he just does these voices  And you're like  Holy crap  That's unbelievable  I do a really good Sylvia Miles  You are going to ask me for money?  That's damn good  Wow  Lieutenant Dan  You know who used to do a great female voice  Was  What's his name?  Joe DeRosa  Just a speaking voice  Billy West  Billy West  Billy West did  One of the funniest fucking things ever on Howard  Years ago when I used to work 
[02:13:00]  And listen to the show  When he would call the back office  And Gary was back there  And he'd be like with a woman voice  Can I speak with Barbara?  And he's like  Barbara who?  And you'd hear him start laughing  He goes  Barbara Bowie?  And he's like  Alright enough  Click  And then he kept calling with other like things that could be  Bob  You know  Bob who?  Bob Bowie  He just kept fucking him like that  It was hilarious  Billy was great  Sam we gotta find this clip  Which clip?  Oh good luck 
[02:13:30]  E-Rock wasn't listening  Why do we keep getting like the likes of  Sam and E-Rock  Did E-Rock send him in?  People that can't navigate their way out of the internet harbor  He said he wouldn't come in?  Yeah E-Rock said he wouldn't  Why'd you say that?  Why wouldn't you come in E-Rock?  Sam's here  That's what Sam does  But we don't need you in that room right now  Alright just find him  You know who we're looking for  Frank which one do you want to play for?  It's funny  You guys  I don't see anything  I don't know  What's his name?  Terry?  Terry Fader  Why don't you want to come in the room Eric?  You just smashed him  F-A-T-O-R  F-A-T-O-R you dumb shit 
[02:14:00]  Oh wow  He's the biggest actor  He's like the number one single actor in Vegas  This guy is massively huge  Yeah  And he was a nobody before he went on America's Got Talent  Alright welcome back  This is the America's Got Talent finale  Jerry Springer days  For the best new act in America  Now for one of our four acts  Life will never be the same again  And now it's time for my final film  I don't want to see Jerry Springer  He's Terry Fader  He's holding a mic like David Tell  Alright  Did she say why?  She said I was really too fast 
[02:14:30]  I'm going to dedicate this song to her  This is going to hurt me  I want to hear Frank's Richard Friar  What an amazing ventriloquist though  I would just record everything  So you look really good  He told me that when they  When he went to America's Got Talent  They were actually checking him for recording devices  Really? 
[02:15:00]  Because he's singing  It's unbelievable  His mouth doesn't move at all  He's not moving his mouth  How much does he make?  I think he signed a contract for a hundred million dollars  A show  What?  Per show?  That's a fucking lot of money  I think it's a hundred million  Over like five or ten years  Or something like that  I could do that  I could do that  Who's the  I'm not saying this to be mean  Do you think being fat  Helps him 
[02:15:30]  Because you can't see his Adam's apple  Going up and down  Do you know what I mean?  Skinny ventriloquist  You can see that thing just popping  This thing is like  Who's talking?  Oh  Touche  You did yourself  Don't bother me  I'm trying to help you  Do it to yourself  I'm not saying  I'm just saying that I think it might help  That's funny  Usually when you see those guys  You can see that thing  Their Adam's apple going up and down  That was good  He's amazing  I can do that  Come on  Watch 
[02:16:00]  Watch  I'm going to do it  I need a puppet  Use Jimmy  Use a napkin  Jimmy on your lap  I'd love to be your puppet  There you go  Crying  I can see  Crying  I can see the veins in his neck  I can see his tranny Adam's apple  Going up and down  I know  I need more fat  Here's why you're doing it wrong  Crying  I just hide behind the napkin  You could be like  Yeah  Like a Muslim  Yeah  Being impressionist in fucking Pakistan 
[02:16:30]  It's not at all impressive  I am the greatest  You can't even see my lips move  Yeah  What about the old drink water  And do the ventriloquism at the same time  How do they do that?  They're not really drinking the water probably  Probably not  That was a funny  I saw one guy do that  Where he was like  I'm going to drink water  And do this  And then he just went  I love that stuff  I will say  That guy  Is there another  One more clip of him  He's fucking awesome  What's the  I can't think of the  Jazz singer  She just passed away recently  I think 
[02:17:00]  Ethel  Mertz  Ethel  Mertz  Who even knows who that is anymore  I know  I'm an older gentleman  Emma Taylor  Do that one  It's Etta James  That's what it is  Etta James  Why Emma Taylor then?  Because I think that's his character  That's based on  You get original characters  That are  Based on celebrities  Like Jimmy Norton  Does he only do a puppet  Or does he do a freewheeling impression  He does  He doesn't really do 
[02:17:30]  Talking impressions  Hey listen guys  That's the actual term  Is it called freewheeling?  It's freewheeling  It is  Is it?  There he goes  Yeah  Nice  This is from his Vegas show  Yeah why would you open it bigger  Sam you non-computer motherfucker  God damn these people  Without the full screen  You're fired  It's not HD either guys  Yeah exactly  No of course not  Why would it be?  Wow  I don't know  Get the fuck out of here 
[02:18:00]  Without reading your lips  What the fuck  And you have to move your hand  At the same time  Yeah  That's fucked up  They're just showing the puppet  Dumb cameraman  It's like his lips aren't even moving  Can you get your cock off my fucking forearm please  God damn it 
[02:18:30]  It's hard to sing with your mouth closed  Unbelievable  It's ridiculous  And you see him live  You're just like  But it's very different than something like I do  I'm going from joke to joke  Voice to voice  He comes out and just  He has little things in between  Intros and stuff like that  But then it's really a singing show  But when you don't see him live  And you're sitting kind of toward the back  Hey you're not seeing his mouth anyway right? 
[02:19:00]  If I was a banditrela  I would just have everyone seated really far back  And just move my mouth  No one would even know  Maybe even in another room  Yeah  This guy's great  How great with that  There's just emptiness in front of the stage  Yeah  Well there's a bunch of weird props on the stage  Like palm trees  Oh and you just keep passing behind things  Yeah  It was like the big boppers  Fucking awful bunch of phones  Hello  You're hiding behind them  Hello baby  A lot of shadows on the stage  So it was he walking  Walking out of the beat 
[02:19:30]  Why hasn't anyone done that bit?  That'd be really funny  That's very funny man  Oh yeah  You just stand in a big shadow  And the light's on the bottom  That would be very funny  And then during a break  You come out  You do the smile nod thing  And then you're behind a tree  And do it again  Another verse  Yeah you just keep fading the light down  Since you're in black  I'm gonna do that  Danny said by the way  It took him five seconds  To find a move that bus  From the TV show  I knew Danny would be able to find it  He said  Look the note's in front of me  Found a move that bus  In five seconds

[02:22:30]  The other one was Mexican  Two different massages  What's a Mexican massage?  They just jerk you off right away  There's no massage  They jerk you off  Like a cartel member  Sawing your head off  I went to Tijuana  And I got one of those massages  And she got literally  Right away in the 69 position  And I was like  Oh  I was like  No I'm good  I'm good  Did you ever partake  When you were overseas?

[02:23:30]  Fuck it  And you're just getting shit faced  I've been doing that  For eight years  It seems like  It's pretty much  Our business model  On the show  Like the one in Boston  You were just  Fucking tanked  Yeah  Well we were  You know  What we do a lot  Is we do these  Elaborate homages  To films that nobody's seen  Right  So I was really  The film  The Friends of Eddie Coyle  And a lot of like  Sort of mid 70s  Action police films  So we tried real hard  To make it look like that  And a lot of  A lot of Bostonians  Were pissed  Actually  It's like  Is there any place 
[02:24:00]  Other than  You know  Southie  I was mad too  Really  You didn't go to Medford  Medford  And get the steak and cheese  Right  And also  My sidekick was from Hingham  And a lot of people  Were pissed about that too  Yeah  Because that's not really Boston  That's fucking Hingham  Yeah  But he's from a legendary  Boston band  That you know  I thought he'd earned his  Boston  No  Fahrenheit  The Unband  The greatest band ever  To come out of Boston  They were so good  They were banned in Boston  Oh  What are they called? 
[02:24:30]  The Unband  I don't know anything about them  They kicked out of town  Pretty quick  For what reason?  So were we  Dead Pets  They were sort of a power pop  Punk band  That ended up getting  You know  When they went out on the road  They got stuck with  All these sort of  Declining hair metal bands  And the author  Mike Ruffino  The bass player  Mike Ruffino  Wrote this amazing  Memoir  Of his time on the road  With like  You know  Ronnie James Dio  And Lemmy 
[02:25:00]  And people like that  Called Gentlemanly Repose  It's probably the funniest  Rock and roll memoir  Ever  His name is  Mike Ruffino  You said that  I know the name  I don't know where I know it from  But I do know that name  He did a lot of music  On the show now  And they're great  They have a great  They have a great cover  Of what is it  Oh boy  I love the one you did  With the trannies  What's that?  The females?  Not you James  Which one was that?  Which one?  Well you were in Samoa  I think  It was like Tahiti

[02:26:00]  You know  I mean  You know  We're reaching the point  I have to just  You know  Poke myself in the eye  With a stick  To provide some  Television entertainment  One of the characters  At the table  I remember  Had a skin condition  Though  And like was having  Actually like  Sheets of skin  Hanging off  Holy shit  And I'm thinking  This is you know  This is a great meal scene  I'm trying to  Choke down raw tuna  Looking across the table  At this you know  Leopard  Nasty  They kept blurring  That bitch out too  Like you  The smoking hot one  Was they just  Showing her  The whole time

[02:28:30]  But I mean  You know  When you go to the  South Pacific  You're expecting  Something different  Is France overrated  I don't know  Unspoiled  Paris  France is underrated  These days  Oh it is  Okay  What about a place  That you were surprised at  That you thought  Oh man  I can't believe  I gotta go here  Philadelphia  Philadelphia  It's kind of cool  I just had a really good time  In Philly  Toronto  What do you like about Philly  Great bars  Great bars  And attitudes  There's something about  The Philly attitude  Like for years  You know  I'd go through a book tour  And people would ask  How come you  How come you haven't done a show here 
[02:29:00]  How come you haven't done a show here  And then  It quickly became  You know  How come you haven't done a show here  Hey you know what  Fuck you  We don't need you  Yeah  I kinda like that attitude  I kinda like that attitude  You did one in Maine  And like this guy  Was kind of a dick  The owner of the restaurant  Was kind of a dick  Yeah  And then you kind of trashed  Which I never really  You don't really do  You always say something nice  But this guy was really a dick  He was rude to his server  He was being a dick to his waiter  And that's an unpardonable sin  As far as I'm concerned  If you're taking your personal shit out  On your server 
[02:29:30]  Or your waiter  You know  Cause you're not happy with the food  Or just cause you're a miserable prick  You're pretty much dead to me  We could never  You know  That's it  Meals over  Relationships over  It was an uncomfortable  Meal  Was he trying to show off for you  Or was he just that guy  He was just that guy  That guy  So why did you guys decide  To go there  The food wasn't that good  I trashed the restaurant too  He's like  This wasn't good  That's mediocre  I wouldn't stop here  Yeah  You say it to him  Or do you say it to him  He said it on the show  It was great  It was great  And he showed the clip  Where he was a dick to the waiter  Just a little piece  And the guy was like

I know  It's like how much?  A thousand  It'll cost you  What?  For two people  It'll be well north of a thousand dollars  That's for sure  And it is worth it  Minimum  Who the fuck do you like that much?  Me and a bag of shells  I know  You better fuck after that 
[02:39:00]  Me and a bag of shells  Yeah you better fuck  I don't care if you're a boy either  What do you get for that?  Is that without liquor?  With liquor  You get  He's paying $300 a pound  Wholesale for the tuna  For instance  He's making rice  It's so out of  Just so insane  Come on  It's like  You eat that sushi  And it's like moving from  I don't know  From a Prius  To a Ferrari  You know  The difference is that start  You know what that means?  You'll never eat sushi yet  Yeah  You'll never go back to your shitty sushi joint 
[02:39:30]  Right  I think he could  I think he could  Did you do that one time?  Yeah you could  I love sushi  You go into the bodega  And get the sushi in the plastic  Right  Oh gosh  Do you like  Gary's sushi is very good  I don't like Gary's sushi  Yeah yeah  And they deliver  Overrated  They do yeah  Yeah what's great about them  Is like France  $200 lunch  They rise in good shape  I never got that  It's right near my house  Yeah  And I never got that  Because I didn't  Gary  G-A-R-I  Not wine  I'm kidding  It's good 
[02:40:00]  I don't  You know what though  You go out to eat  With somebody who drinks  It's like fucking  Taking an extra person out  I know  Because I  You know I don't drink  All my friends are  You know sober  And then you go out  With somebody who drinks beer  And it's like  That's another  $50 on the tab  Or if they start  Hitting the sake  You could really  It's nothing  Yeah  Well regular drinkers Anthony  Oh okay  Oh  I thought you meant  You know  When you go out  Have a good time  And Anthony is being roasted  What is the date of that 
[02:40:30]  It's October 11th or 12th  You're doing it right Jimmy  Here in New York  Yes of course  No  It's coming up  Everyone I've ever  Been mean to  Or pissed off  Will be there  It's going to be  You know  An evening of  Anal rampage  October 11th  Are you ready  For CNN  That's coming too  Yep  Looking forward to that  I think our first show  Is going to be in  The former Burma  Now Myanmar  And we're hoping  Ah Myanmar  We're hoping to shoot  In Libya  Congo  Oh good luck there  That's great  Well you know  That's what  One of the reasons 
[02:41:00]  We went with CNN  Is they have  An infrastructure  On the ground  That you know  They have experience  Shooting in places  Like that  Everyone has experience  Shooting in places  Yeah  What's your new show  We're going to eat  At Ted's Pizzeria  Across the street  From the fucking  Egyptian embassy  It's the same crew  You know  The same people  I've been making  Television with  For almost 12 years  Now the same  Production company  Same shooters  Editors  Producers  Everybody  We're just moving  The band over to CNN  And going to make  So it's going to be  A similar show  Bigger, cooler, better  And a little hairier 
[02:41:30]  What are you going  To do differently  I think you know  It can be smarter  I don't have to be  Shoving food in my face  Every seven minutes  You know  As travel kind of  At least wants  You know  I think  If  We're looking at the world  From a point of view  Of food and meals  But if we go off the rails  And find something else  Interesting to do  We're free to do that  And we're looking  At more difficult places  Than  You know  Not the  Congo is not  The first place 
[02:42:00]  You'd think of  To do a food and travel show  But it's a place  I'm really interested in  Are you nervous?  You're cooking up  Some missionaries  We got stuck in Bay Area  Am I nervous?  What am I eating?  I'm the sound guy  You gotta be nervous  If necessary  A little bit  I know you've seen a lot  We've been  We've shot at some  Tense places before  I think we're pretty good at it  We're pretty careful  When we're in really hairy places  We travel with some  Very cool security guys  They're all  Former SAS guys 
[02:42:30]  They're not armed  They dress up deliberately  Goofy and unthreatening  They look like  They dress up like  Goofy tourists  But they're really good  If you're shooting  In a Hezbollah neighborhood  It's saying  Now's the time  To get back in a van  You know  Guys  But they're unarmed?  They're unarmed  When you got stuck in Beirut  I mean  We had no one with us then  Were those guys with you?  Nobody  You had nobody  So you were really just stuck  What's the Beirut thing again Bobby?  They were doing a show  And it was great 
[02:43:00]  And it was like  You know  Hey it's cool here now  And then fucking  Just  We look out the window  And we watch the airport explode  And planes start coming in  Right  You know  Treetop level  And suddenly we're in a war  So we were under bombardment  For about  About eight days  Trapped in Beirut  Every other country in the world  Was dragging  Getting their people out  In the end  We were evacuated  We had to go down to the beach  And get evacuated by the Marine Corps  You know  One of those LCUs  You know  The front thing  They come in  That flops down 
[02:43:30]  You know  Through the water  With your luggage  I would have left the luggage behind  But it made an impression  Because  You know  It was a hairy  It was a hairy eight days  What did you do for those eight days?  We were mostly  Penned up in a hotel  With the bombs  Getting  And the rockets  Getting closer  You know  The cell phone signal  Was getting weaker  You know  Internet was getting dodgier  Yeah  The infrastructure  Was starting to get a little shaky  Everyone we knew  All our contacts  All of our  You know  Drivers  Translators  They bugged out  For Syria  On day two 
[02:44:00]  We'd get out  Now and again  For a meal  But generally  We were sort of  Under house arrest  With this sinister  Security guy  The network  Sent in  From Yemen  Or something  You know  We shot  You know  We filmed the experience  You cooked  Cooked  Yeah you cooked  For the crew  But it made an impression  On me  When the first  LCU came in  The front drops  And the Marines come out  Standing there  As Barbara Starr  From CNN  And I thought  You know  I gotta think about  This network  Wow 
[02:44:30]  Jesus Christ  Did you think  You were gonna die  At any point  That's insane  You didn't  That is crazy  No  I was never  Scared there  I was more depressed  And sort of  Heartbroken about it  Because it's an amazing  Place, Beirut  It's amazing  What do you think  Bobby's gonna make it  Everything right  And everything wrong  In the world  All in one place  It's really  It's a mixed bag  At the time  It was like this  Rumsfeldian vision  Of what the Middle East  Should be  You know  It was like hip  And nightclubs  Cool  You know  Fun  Very tolerant 
[02:45:00]  Now less so  So I wasn't scared  There  The times  We've been scared  On the show  Is in places  Where there's  Zero infrastructure  Where it's just  A lot of  Really really hungry  Young men  Standing around  In markets  Looking at you  And your camera  Equipment  And thinking  Hey that camera  Could feed my family  For six months  You gotta eat  Rhino asshole  No  No cops  No paved roads  No cash machines  You know  No nothing  Do you make deals  With these guys 
[02:45:30]  So they leave you alone  How do you  You try not to piss  Anybody off  Right  If there's an  Infrastructure  Meaning there's  An organized  Like if you're  Shooting in favelas  Or south american  Slums for instance  You generally  There's a local  Crime boss  Okay  The local dealer  Whoever controls  That section  You go to him  You show him  The respect  And generally speaking  They're happy to have you  You know  Come on in  We'll barbecue  You know  It's not about money  It's about  The american tv  Acknowledging that  He's the power  That's always scary 
[02:46:00]  When you see that  Totally cool  You're in good hands  So you went into  The favelas in brazil  It's when they're  Yeah  You did the colombia  Too  We went to colombia  Was scary  Those are  Those it was never  Any problem  It's places like  Liberia  Where there's no  Real working  Structure  And just a lot  Of hungry people  And look  Hungry people  Act like hungry people  Meaning  Sooner or later  If they can  They're gonna  Desperate  You see a 22 year old  Guy with flip flops  And a fucking hulk t-shirt  You're like  Oh god  That's who's gonna  That's the guy 
[02:46:30]  Who's gonna kill you  They're gonna be wearing  Like a tweety bird t-shirt  Yeah  Exactly  You know  Yeah he's looking at  Your fucking Armani shirt  Your fucking rolex  He's wearing a tweety bird t-shirt  Who looked out for you  In Liberia  Yeah we had our  Security dudes  But you know  They had  What they do  What they do  Is one guy  Will stay close  Just hanging out  And one will be  Across the street  Just looking at  The bigger picture  Oh right right  You know  If somebody's  Looking a little crazy  A little lay of the land  15 feet down  He'll say  You know 
[02:47:00]  Time to go guys  We hired somebody  In Brazil  When we went to Brazil  We hired a guy  To hang with us  And then we hired a guy  Yeah man  You did  We were there  We hired that guy  The fucking dude  That was from the favelas  Oh just to pick us up though  No we hung out with us  At night  At the cafes  And the clubs  Remember we were hanging out  With that little Chinese dude  Who got robbed  The night before  I don't remember  You need someone like that  You know  When the real power structure  Is a criminal  You know  You hire a criminal  Yeah  I mean a lot of times 
[02:47:30]  We'd be in situations  Where you'd say  Oh shoot this side of the street  All you want  But please don't shoot  That side of the street  Because that's  All my drug operations  But you need people like that  Or you're not shooting  In those places  So your producers  Or whatever  Would go to the guys  And you know  Again  Say in the projects  Our fixer on the ground  Our translator  We're hiring them  In the first place  Because they know people like that  Okay  And then would you have  Would you meet with the guys  Who ran the favelas  Or would that be taken care of  Before you got there  Or would you have to meet  With them as well  Generally  Generally there's a  There's got to be a meet and greet  You know  Kiss to the ring 
[02:48:00]  Kind of a  Wow  How do you do  A little  You know  Just like any  Did you ever run into trouble though  Where you were like  Fuck  Like these guys are going to kill us  We've had  We had one of our  Produced  Producer and a couple of shooters  Waylaid by some law enforcement people once  In the middle of the night  Face down on the ground  You know  One of them was sent off to the cash machine  To take care of the situation  Oh boy  And while he's away  One of the cops suddenly unzips his pants 
[02:48:30]  And drops trowel  And you can imagine  You're laying there on your stomach  In the middle of the woods  Right  And you know  In a third world country  And you hear zip  Oh man  And it's like  No no  It was just  Pissed next to his head  Just to make a point  But he didn't piss on him  No  He got some splatter though  Look if he  I'm sure he was relieved  Considering the alternative  Sure  Bring out the gimp  Oh my god  That would scare  I remember we were in Brazil  We got pulled over by the cops  Me and Patrice  Me and Patrice were fighting 
[02:49:00]  The whole way there  Because the rule was  No hookers in the car  In the car  They always take a separate cab  So they can't set you up  And throw drugs on the floor  Right  But Patrice's girl  Whatever  Didn't want to go  In the separate car  So he threw in the back  With me  And I'm like  I don't want her fucking near me  And then we're screaming  At each other  And then there's a roadblock  And I got so nervous  And there was a  You know  He has a machine gun  With the finger  On the trigger  Which is a no no  They teach you that  In cop school  Right  Well they say don't do that 
[02:49:30]  Until you're ready to use it  They're always ready to use it  That's why  God dude  And the guy  Scratched their foreheads  With the finger  On the trigger  The guy  They all had their fingers  On the trigger  The guy  The lieutenant  Who had those fucking  You know  Gaddafi fucking badges  The shoulder  The big hat  And he kept hitting me  Going  Blah blah blah blah  Whatever  And I'd be like  See  I tried to assimilate  Oh no  But to Mexican  Instead of Portuguese  See  I was going see  See I said see  87 times  Patrice 
[02:50:00]  You heard Patrice  At one point go  He had a gun  To his fucking rib cage  And he's going  Because I'm going see  We had to take  Before we went to  We went to Kurdistan  In Iraq  And we had to take  What's called  The HET course  Hazardous Environment Training  So me and the whole  Camera crew  Go off to  West Virginia  These little training  Military training camps  Out there  Where they  Teach journalists  And people who are going  To high risk areas  Stuff like  How to treat  A sucking chest wound 
[02:50:30]  Deal with  Kidnapping  How to handle  Roadblocks  So you do a lot of  Like play acting  And also they throw  You into situations  Where you know  All they tell you  Is you know  You're two journalists  You're headed off  To a rendezvous  At you know  Point X  And you learn  Map reading  And coordinates  And in the middle  Of that all these  Guys playing terrorists  Come out and start  Shooting at you  With blanks  And your driver  Suddenly starts spewing  Fake blood  And you've got to  Deal with the situation  It was a  Rolicking good time  That sounds 
[02:51:00]  I guess what I'm getting at  Is if you ever have  A sucking chest wound  I'd be your guy  You can figure it out  Oh yeah  He's your man  I think we've got to  Take a break  Because Frank Oz  Is Frank here?

Blu-ray? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah  Yeah  It's all  Blu-ray  I'm October 9th  October the 9th  Now is this an anniversary  Or is this just  They just go on Blu-ray  So you're out promoting  I don't know  I mean I was told  I was called about a year ago  Less than a year ago  Saying hey you know what  We put the ending  Back together  And I saw it  And I loved it  So they just told me  It's wonderful  Yeah  The reason it's wonderful  Is there's a guy named Richard Conway  And Richard Conway did all the effects  In the movie 
[02:57:30]  Which is not CGI  No CGI back then  Yeah  Everything's real  There's only two optical shots  In the whole damn movie  And everything was on the floor  And so he did  Wow  He did all these effects  And took about almost a year  And about a million dollars  And the first and second preview  Was fantastic  In San Jose  About 25 years ago  And in Los Angeles  Until the last 10 minutes  Oh wow  And we killed the stars 
[02:58:00]  Yes  And they hated us  And they were  It was a disaster  So we had to change the ending  And I had to call Richard  And say Richard  You know all that work you did  For about a year  Can't use any of it  Oh wow  It was awful  Yeah  But the great thing is  When they did this  I got to call Richard in London  Who's still working on a gig right now  And I said  Richard  You know that work  25 years ago  We couldn't use  Now we're going to see it  So that was the biggest joy for me  Yeah  It's finally going to be seen  By the public  That's awful  When you work on something 
[02:58:30]  I mean everyone's done  Like a one or two lines  That's gotten cut out of a film  I know I certainly have  But I mean  When you work that hard  On something  And they have to change  The entire ending  It's just  It's awful  You've been cut out of films  Yeah  I don't think I've ever  Been left in one  That's the worst  When you go to a premiere  With a chick  And they just  They cut you out  Of the whole fucking movie  His father would edit him  Out of home movies  The worst time  The worst thing  It was awful  I've always learned  Whenever I do a movie  What I do  And if I have to cut somebody else  I always write them  A personal note 
[02:59:00]  Saying you're going to be  Cut out of the movie  That's great  The reason is  I felt so awful  When I did  The Muppets Take Manhattan  It was the very first movie  I ever did  I ever did  There was  I had a scene  Where there was  The Muppets were in  A locker  They had to  Like a bus locker  That's where they lived  And so  We hired like  Just part of the gag  Three little people  And unfortunately  I had to cut out  Some of that  And the night  Of the preview  It was awful  I saw the person  The guy  I cut out  And he brought 
[02:59:30]  His entire family  Oh  Oh no  It was so hurtful  And so  Ever since then  I always write a note  Saying please understand  I had to cut you out  But here's why  You directed  The score  Yeah  And there's legendary stories  About how difficult  Brando was to work with  I mean an amazing  Maybe one of the greatest  If not the greatest  But how was he to direct  Was he impossible to direct  Or difficult  Well you're assuming  He let me direct him  Is that true  I mean  Well here's the thing  It was my fault 
[03:00:00]  Okay  What happened was  That Marlon came on  And  I think the truth was  He was scared  Marlon was scared  Most actors are scared  No matter how big they are  Really  And  Through that fear  He  Insulted me  And I took it personally  And that's not my job  My job is to  Let it slide off my back  And support the actor  But  Ever since  When that happened  And I took it personally  And I was really angry 
[03:00:30]  In that trailer  And I left the trailer  And slammed the door  And walked out  Ever since that moment  He tried to apologize to me  And I was an asshole  And I said  I'm not going to let him  Treat me that way  That was for about  A day and a half  And I realized my mistake  And after that  Wouldn't let me direct him  It was De Niro  Who directed him  Right  Is that what he did  Or  No it was Bob  Thank God  The last  In one scene  Bob was able to direct him  And I had a TV monitor 
[03:01:00]  In my trailer  And so I would see  What's going on  And Bob would ask me  What should I do  And I'd say  Can you try this  And I'd call the takes  And everything  Wow  But it was really my fault  You know  It was one of these  Learning processes  That I felt very bad about  And he  I thought he was a sweetheart  I thought he was a sweet  Childlike  Wonderful person  He could have demanded  He play the part  In a dress  With an Irish accent  I think he did that  To a pen  That was my problem  I said to myself  I am not going to let him  Take over my movie  Unfortunately 
[03:01:30]  I was too tough  And as a result  I didn't do my job  With nourishing him  And so  You know  That's interesting  He was scared  It would never occur to me  That that would be  Marlon Brando  But I guess you're right  Every actor is scared  Every single one  I've ever worked with  Do you think  When a guy like  Someone even of that magnitude  Works with someone like  Edward Norton  Very respected  And De Niro is an icon  So he knows he's working  With other guys  Who are the top  Yeah  Wow  But you know  There's reasons to be scared  I mean  When you're on 
[03:02:00]  Doing a show  A movie  A TV show  Whatever  You're scared right  Always  Yeah right  And if you're not scared  I question a little bit  But I should be  Because I know  I kind of stink  It's like you know  He won for  The waterfront  But here's the thing  Here's a guy who has  There's a tremendous  Amount of expectation  So it's not just  Getting there  It's once you're there  Oh yeah  People expect a great deal  From you  And he was extraordinary  I was so fond of him  And he hated me 
[03:02:30]  And I understand why  Did  Is this true  Or is this just a myth  That he shot certain scenes  Without pants  So he could not  Let me tell you that  I tell you why  Why Marlon  Hated the press  And I  And I completely understand  Here's what happened  We were in Montreal  And it was a really tough summer  And we were in a set  In the studio  And we were lighting  And not on  Not only was it like  90 degrees and humid  But we were putting lights on  So not unlike 
[03:03:00]  In theater  And other places  You know  You basically tell  Your wardrobe person  I'm not going to the trailer here  Just I'm going to dress here  On the set  So he had  His pants off  Just had shorts  And he was playing the piano  And then when it was time to go  I said okay  Let's get going  And he put his pants on  That's very normal  Oh yeah  Sure sure  That was the truth  And throughout  Throughout Time Magazine  And everything else  It was like  He won't work  Unless you shoot him  Above the waist  So if you  If you're Brando  And if you get that nonsense 
[03:03:30]  I don't blame him  For disliking the press  You know  Because that's all  That happened  It's all that happened  And was he  Because he's legendary  Or was legendary  For not remembering his lines  Which you know  Maybe is what worked for him  So well  Did he remember the lines  Or did he just kind of  He didn't remember them  No  Marlon  You know  He was a very touching  Fellow to me  I met him in  In his home  A couple of times  And one thing he said to me  And I haven't shared this actually  Once he said to me 
[03:04:00]  After he got pilloried  In one movie  Was it Tango in Paris?  I'm not sure  And he really  He really said  He opened up his heart  And he realized  He said  That  People didn't care  Well  Because that was a great movie  He was brilliant at it  Yeah  Yeah  But supposedly he got some  Notices that hurt him  He's a very sensitive fellow  And so ever since then  He felt that  What he said to me anyway  Was that  It doesn't really matter 
[03:04:30]  Whether I know the lines  Or I try whatever  It's  The audience is still  Going to react the same way  And so what he did  Is he has a  He had an earpiece  And he had  Avra  His assistant  In another room  Read the lines to him  Before he said it  Now  One view of it is  He's lazy  The other view of it  Which was his  Is  It's more spontaneous  So  One can make  One's own mind up  I  You're saying the Godfather  He'd glue lines  All over  The other actors  And stuff like that  Look if you're Marlon Brando 
[03:05:00]  However you get there  Who cares  You know  My feeling of Marlon was  He really  Everything before  I yelled  Action  He hated  Everything  After  I yelled  Cut  He hated  The acting  He loved  In my opinion  He couldn't be that good  But all the crap before  And all the crap after  Take  In my opinion  Because he  He was  He was  He was pilloried  By the press  So many times  That made me love him  Even more though  When I heard he used  An earpiece 
[03:05:30]  Like I know he did it  In Dr. Mara  I didn't realize he did it  With you guys too  But it's like  To be able to deliver lines  That are just read to you  In an earpiece  Is just  It's awesome  I mean I don't think  There's anybody working  That could pull that off  And have believable  Organic  Discussions  With lines being fed  To them  Padma Lakshmi  Who's that  Top chef  It's  Pack your knives  And go  He was amazing  I mean I  You know he 
[03:06:00]  Well anyway  He was  I felt  I really was fond of him  Did you ever make up with him  Were you ever able to  After that  No  Did you try  Or was it  I tried  It was too late  I made a mistake  Wow  But I learned  Kind of holding a  A grudge like that  For one mistake  That's kind of  Where'd this guy go  Where did Rick Moranis go  He was like the funniest guy ever  I just had dinner with Rick last night  Why am I not seeing him  In more movies  Rick  Rick made a decision  To be a father  Because his wife passed away 
[03:06:30]  About 20 years ago  And so he really became a dad  And out of the business  In order to bring his kids up  And now his kids are grown  In college  And maybe you'll see more of them  I don't know  Yeah he was in everything  For a while  He was in everything  He's smart  Brilliant  The old Second City TV shows  Were brilliant  And then he was in a lot of movies  And then he wasn't  Yeah  It was his choice  What do you think about CGI  Because I mean  Obviously that took a lot of people  To control  The plant 
[03:07:00]  Was it Audrey?  Yeah  The plant  And Little Shabaharas  A lot of cables  A lot of people in there  Hands all over the place  People laying down  Upside down  I do a great impression  Of the plant  By the way  Do you?  Feed me Seymour  See  That's just very natural  For you to say  He totally nailed you right there  It's a good fat joke  Yeah  So what do you think  Of CGI and the use  Or overuse of it?  I think it's like 
[03:07:30]  We probably all feel  Which is if it enhances  The story  If it's organic  To the story  And that's great  But I think I'm  Just as tired  As probably anybody else  To see the huge  Big CGI ending  To take ten minutes  Of volcanic reaction  I just  If it helps a story  Fantastic  If it helps a character  Fantastic  But if it's just for itself  It's kind of boring  Yeah  And you've been obviously  You're the creator  Of some of the most famous  Voices in film ever  I mean obviously  Was there anything  That you did  That you wanted  A voice that you wanted to do 
[03:08:00]  Or that you tried  And just couldn't make work  Or is there a character  That you tried to develop  That just never  Could find any good place?  Yeah  Actually the voice is odd  Because the voice  Is only five percent of it  I mean we  Jim and me  And the other guys  We perform the characters  And that's the hard part  The actual performance  Of them  Physical performance  You know  When I did Sesame Street  There are some things  That you know  There are some characters  That didn't work  And went by the wayside  There was no real character  And voice that I ever tried  And couldn't do 
[03:08:30]  I mean I remember  With Bert and Ernie  Jim in the beginning  And I  We switched characters  And he tried to do Bert  And I tried to do Ernie  It didn't work  And so we switched  But no not really  You know  There's nothing that I  Wanted to do  As far as character stuff  That I didn't do  How weird is it  To hear yourself  Translated into other languages  When they're not doing  The voices right  At all  You know  I  It was translated  In like  I don't know  How many languages  And so you just  You just  It didn't bother me 
[03:09:00]  They were close  But you just hope  The gags land  You never know  My show's dubbed  In Italian  And my wife's Italian  And her parents  Finally meet me  And they say  What's the matter  With his voice  It's not the manly  Deep baritone  That I have in Italy  I have a question  Are you aware  You know  I'm a dad  And I have  Bought a lot  Of Sesame Street  DVDs  The first two seasons  Come with a parental 
[03:09:30]  Advisory now  What?  Really?  Why?  There is a little  Cautionary  That they do not  Conform to  Contemporary standards  Can you believe this?  What is that about?  It's absolute horse cookie  Yeah  Cookie monster  Likes cookies  A little too much  Nonsense  Or something like this  Is it the silliest thing ever?  Nonsense  Isn't that ridiculous?  As much good as  Sesame Street is done  It's truly ridiculous  Because  You know  I remember  John Stone 
[03:10:00]  Was the  Really kind of  The father of  Sesame Street  He was the director  On Sesame Street  And I remember  Jim and I  Were having a ball  Doing a piece  I forgot what it was  We were laughing  And then I said to John  What does this teach?  And he says  Who cares?  And it was  What it said was  Who cares?  It's imagination  It's fun  It's celebration  You know  And it's  I don't know  Where that other stuff  Comes from  But as far as  Cookies go  You know  Why don't you let  The children  Just eat cookies  For God's sake  Somebody 
[03:10:30]  Somebody said to me  Once  You know  Look at me  Cookie monster  Cookie monster  Is you know  It's not good  For children  He's saying  Me want this  Me want that  It's not right  And I'm thinking  You know  I don't know  Of any  Person who grew up  To be a lawyer  Saying me  Want to represent  You  I mean  It's just  There's  There's  There's  There's  There's  There's  There's  There's  There's  There's  There's  There's  There's  Support  In other  Directions  To  So I think  It's nonsense  So much thought  Too much thought  Is going into 
[03:11:00]  Certain things  Where  Just let a kid  Be a kid  Absolutely  And if  He's watching a puppet  Eat a bunch of cookies  Oh for God's sake  It doesn't mean  He's going to grow up  Well you know  Somebody sued  Tried to sue them  For something  And they had to  Put that in there  Just so they  They don't get sued  Oscar the ground  Started me on a life  Of homicidal rages  Yes yes  Living in garbage cans  It's sad  Because  You know  There's no  You know  No reason to censor  Something when  That's all about  Imagination  And joy  And being  Being a kid  Yeah  And when you're a kid 
[03:11:30]  You experiment too  Yeah  And has anything  Ever been more  Widely celebrated  Iconic  And widely loved  Than Sesame Street  Yeah  Yeah  That's weird  You started with  Jim  With the Muppets  Yeah  And like  How did that whole thing  Come to be  Because puppets  Before the Muppets  Were very square  Very old school  Very  You're the only one  Who said that  Really  Yeah  It's kind of  A bone of contention 
[03:12:00]  Because you're  Absolutely right  Because usually  Before the Muppets  There was like  The princess puppet  There was the king puppet  There was the dragon puppet  Jim  Just exploded everything  Right  Yeah  Just exploded everything  And now  It's almost like  When you say  A puppet  You say a Muppet  It's almost like  When you say  Tissue paper  You say Kleenex  Right  Or Xerox  For copying  Yeah  And it's exactly  It's exactly right  I don't think  I've ever heard  Anybody point that out  I'm amazing  I actually said that  Before the show  To him  No you didn't  Jimmy  Stealing my point  From Frank Oz  Frank Hurtful  So I'll accept 
[03:12:30]  The compliment  It was a breakthrough  And when you look  At it early on  Especially  It did have  A very 60's  Kind of freedom  Feel about it  And then  To have it last  And actually grow  Over the years  Like that is amazing  Yeah  Did you see  Did you see  The longevity of it  Early on  Go like  These things  Will really catch on  No  We're just doing  Gig after gig  We just  Yeah  We just do  From the  From the  You know  In the beginning  We're doing commercials  And then  Then we're doing 
[03:13:00]  Every single variety  Show there was  And then we just  Sesame Street  And then we  The Muppet  It just kind of  You know  You just work  And have a lot  Of fun working  Yeah  It's very hard  But have a lot  Of fun working  And how do  Were you  Were you working  Puppets before that  Or something  Yeah  Like you said  When you watch  Somebody working  A puppet well  You don't notice  Because they're doing  It so well  Yeah  You just  Instantly think  That's a real  Live thing  Well yeah  If you're doing it  It  You have to  Believe it 
[03:13:30]  And then it  Becomes  Itself  Yeah  It just does  You know  And usually  People put on  Puppets and they  Start wiggling  Like crazy  And it's just  What the hell  What are you doing  You know  It's like  Do you do that  When you're  When you meet  Somebody  Do you all of a sudden  Start wiggling  Like crazy  No  They just move  Their hand around  They're attempting  To give it life  And not realizing  That you cannot  Wiggle it  And have a life  The best way  To give it life  Do nothing  Wait  Wait and listen  That's all  One thing I noticed  With especially Muppets  Because the mouths 
[03:14:00]  Are so prominent  And stuff  It's not just  An open and  Close the mouth  Thing  It seems like  The back of the mouth  Is actually projecting  Forward when they  Talk more than  You  I mean  This is  This is so bizarre  As per our  Discussion  Before the show  Jimmy  You are the only  One who's actually  Noticed that  Really  Because that's  Exactly right  Because when you're  When you're talking  It's not just this  But it's pushing out  The sound  Yeah  It's definitely  The back of the mouth  Is moving forward  More than the mouth  What do you do in your previous life  I know 
[03:14:30]  I watch  You're terrible  I've watched a lot  Of television  It's weird  Little Shop of Horrors  When I did Little Shop  What people don't know  When they watch that  Is the plant  Is talking  Okay  Now  When that plant  Got to be  A literal ton  It took about  30 people to work at  It was a ton  And  Early on  We didn't know  How to do it  Because  There's a fast patter song  And  Foam rubber 
[03:15:00]  Does not  Go that fast  It just doesn't  There's a normal  Oscillation  That doesn't work  So it doesn't work  So we had this big song  Fast patter  Mean Green Mother  From Outer Space  And  In rehearsals  What was happening  With the videotape  We were rehearsing it  And as we were rehearsing it  Couldn't do it  And I was forwarding  And rewinding  And all of a sudden  It looked great  So  Because it was going fast  So people don't know  But what we had to do  Is when  Rick Moranis  Or Alan  Maybe Rick  Was with a plant 
[03:15:30]  He had to  Move like  This  And sing  This slow  So we would shoot him  And the plant  Together  At 16 frames  So it would then  Come out  Like the plant  Was singing fast  Oh man  That's tough  And not only that  When I recorded  Levi Stubbs  From the four tops  I had to record him  But because we had  I had to record him  Doing the plant  But because  We were doing it  16 frames  We had to  Harmonize him 
[03:16:00]  So he  Sounded like that  So when you see  The movie  And you see  Rick and the plant  Together  Rick is doing  Everything  In slow motion  In order for the plant's  Lips to go fast  To make it look like  It was moving fast  Yeah because it's flopping  Wow that's amazing  Yeah  When I was doing  The plant  When I was doing  Rick alone  It was 24 frames  When I was doing  The plant alone  It was like 12 frames  And I'm doing them  Together at 16 frames  It was  Extraordinary  Wow  And you noticed that 
[03:16:30]  During the editing  Like hey  No during the  Rehearsal  Oh the rehearsal  Because you know  When you speed up  A DVD  Or at that time  A VHS  All of a sudden  Things go faster  I thought  Holy cow  Why don't we just do that  It works  It works  Because you couldn't  Work it out  You couldn't do it  At normal speed  Yeah  Because the plant  Actually  When it became  The biggest plant  There was actually  A person inside  The plant  That  Opening and closing 
[03:17:00]  The mouth  And the plant  Was on a  Big steel beam  And behind  The set  There were two guys  Pushing  This kind of  Lever  Back and forth  To make them work  While 30 people  Are underneath  Doing the vines  So it was massive  And the only way  We could have  Actually done that  In real time  Was to have  The film shot  At 16  So when we  Played it back  At 24  It looked like  It was going  Faster than normal  Great idea  Jesus  If you had 
[03:17:30]  If you had  And I know  It's probably  A tough question  But if you had  To pick  Like of all  The things you've  Done  Like the one  That you would  Like to be  Associated with  The most  I guess that  Kind of goes  Without saying  I should have  Said aside  To the obvious  I'm sorry  I don't even  Want to be  Associated with  I'm honest  Is there  A character  I know  That's a very  Tough question  But is there  A character  That you feel  Proudest of  Or like  Wow I love  Where I took  That from  The original  Concept to  Where it became  It's so interesting  You ask  Questions like  An actor  Really  Oh wow  I wonder why  I don't act  Like one 
[03:18:00]  I act like  A fucking  Doorman  You're talking  About the craft  Of creating  Character  And most people  Don't  You're coming  From that end  Which is really  Interesting  That's right  And he was  Asking like  Really easy  Questions  Like hey  How fast  Do your hands  Go  I don't know  You know  Each character  Is to a degree  A part of me  And it's  A facet of me  Like you know  Because it can't  Get away from me  And it's kind of  Filtered through  My professional  Performance ability  So but there's  Always facets of me  And all the characters 
[03:18:30]  I think the character  That was  Has  You know  Bert was very hard  To get a hold of  Piggy took a little while  She's very layered  And erotic  I guess the one  That came most  Organically to me  Of all  Was Grover  Really  Yeah  Very  I have no idea  Where that character  Came from  Except my dog  Helped actually  Really  My dog  Was Fred  At that time  He did some  Physical things  That made me  Say  Oh this is great  This is amazing  Where the inspiration  Comes from  That's very interesting  To me 
[03:19:00]  Because I think  To create  A character  Like you know  Gary Oldman  Does characters  But to create  I saw that  Gary Oldman thing  With you guys  That was great  He's a brilliant  Brilliant actor  Yeah  Yes  Yeah he's phenomenal  And when you said  Shut up everybody  Gary's talking  I love that  It was funny  You know  What was it  I don't know why  I said that  It was something  He probably said  That was  He's brilliant  God he's brilliant  I didn't know  He was British  Until I saw him  Interviewed  Really  Honestly I didn't  Until I saw him  Interviewed  I had no idea  Because I'd see him  Play  I almost said  Sid Bishop  But then I realized  What an asshole 
[03:19:30]  I'd sound like  Because he was British  But in JFK  Is Oswald  And he plays  All these roles  He's absolutely brilliant  I think he's very  Underrated  Underrated  As far as  People know  Who he is  But I don't know  If they  He's like Brando  In a way  Where he just does  All these different  Characters  And all these  Different accents  And he's  You know  Like I think  Brad Pitt kind of  Plays a similar guy  Most of the time  Yeah  That's just my  Take on Brad Pitt  Look at you  That's just my opinion  I'm not just saying that  Because we fight  Over the same chicks  I happen to notice that  And like when you  Did Yoda  Did they say  Hey look  This is what we have 
[03:20:00]  In mind for this  Or did they say  This is what this  Character is  Do what you like  With it  Pretty much  The latter  What I did  With Yoda  Was  I mean  It was written  By George  And Larry  The dialogue  I kind of  Put all the stuff  Together  I didn't make  The character  Somebody else  Made it  It was written  It was by  Somebody else  I kind of  Took the elements  Together  And I remember  Saying to George  I didn't know  George at the time  Hardly at all 
[03:20:30]  But I remember  Saying to George  At EMI Studios  In London  Before we started  Shooting  I said  He was at the canteen  I went over to him  I said  Hey George  Just  You know  Same question you have  What do you want me to do  With Yoda  And I remember him saying  Frank  Just make it wonderful  That's great  What a great show of faith  Yeah  It's exactly right  And that's the idea  Is to let  People blossom  And what you do  When I used to work  With George on that  Is I would throw  Stuff at him  I'd say  Here's one version 
[03:21:00]  Here's another  You pick  Oh sorry Jimmy  Was that cadence  And the backwards  Forwards words  Was that written in  Or was that you  It was partly written in  And I said to George  I felt this was  Important to his character  And so I asked him  If I could continue it  Throughout the whole thing  Oh wow  So he said yeah  That's a lot of pressure  To come into  And they're telling us  We have to wrap Frank  Because he's in the press  That's a lot of pressure  To come into  What is one of the biggest  Movies in history  At the time  And to come into part two  And play a major role  And you know 
[03:21:30]  Attracting one of  Those famous characters  But you know  Talking about acting  Your job is to  Discount all that  And just to get  Deep in the character  If you're thinking  About that  You're in deep shit  You know  What you gotta do  Is get deep in that character  That's your job  And forget about  Everything else  See that's why  I do it wrong  I actually read off paper  And I'll fix it in post  But they do a lot of  Fixing in the editing room  They can make a  Shitty scene  Or a shitty actor  Look really good  In editing  To a degree 
[03:22:00]  Yeah  To a degree  Right  Because yes  You can save a performance  But if you don't have  The bones of that performance  If you don't have  The correct rhythms  Right  And for instance  If I'm talking to you  Like this  And this is the speed  In which I am talking  Yes  You can't edit that  You can't fix that  In the mix  You can't  It's gonna be that  If you just get it once  But you can literally  Get one  Good take of each word  And kind of put it together  That'd be insane  No  Not an actor would say that 
[03:22:30]  I mean of course you can  You can't do that  You can't do one word  What you do is  You do  You do a lot of  Cuts over the shoulders  And things like that  But really  The rhythms are the most  Important thing in editing  And one has to really  You're a slave  To whatever rhythm  The actor did  And what I'll do  Is I'll do the same business  Every time  Even from different angles  So they can use me  Like it's like  There's nothing worse  Than if you do  Like the same action  Twice in a row  This way they can cut it  And edit it  From a different point of view  I told you that  The other day 
[03:23:00]  I told you that  There's nothing ugly  They're trying to take credit  For a good point  Hey wait a minute  I can't take  I can't take the tension here  Yeah I know it's crazy  No I just stole that  Bob told me that in the car  I just wanted to  Really humiliate him  By saying it to you  And sounding smart  Listen Frank is here  Promoting Little Shop of Horrors  It's the director's cut  On Blu-ray  And  With that ending  Yeah  With the obviously  The original ending  And there's  Actually it's got two  It's got the full movie  With the original ending  And it's got the full movie  With the other ending

[03:26:30]  Frank Oz  Frank Oz  Oh it was great  The talent that was on  This show today  Is ridiculous  It's done at the bottom  And it really rose  I was more talking about  Frank Oz and Anthony Bourdain  Anthony Bourdain is a  Ridiculously talented guy  He writes  He's talking about  Writing scenes  For TremÃ©  Yeah I should have  Asked him more about that  Yeah he's great  I love him  I always get reminded  How talentless I am  When people like  Frank Oz and Anthony Bourdain  Are in here  Just being like  Yeah I write  You should feel that way  When you're alone  Why  Why would you say that  As Otto would say  You're a no talent  Beggashite  Well Anthony Bourdain 
[03:27:00]  Is an author too  That's how he became famous  His book  Kitchen Confidential  Yeah  Oh I didn't know that  Oh it's a good book  You should get it  You'd love it  He wrote like a tell-all  On what goes on  In kitchens  And stuff like that  Wow  Yeah that's how  It became popular  Then he got the show  From that I think  I love that he still  Shits on people  I do too  Because he's gotten  More and more famous  He's very famous now  And usually you'd think  Especially with his peers  He would stop shitting on them  Yeah  But he was just in here  Taking a massive dump  On Guy Fieri  Which was good  And accurate 
[03:27:30]  That's why I liked the show  When I first  Because Travel Channel  Was basically like  Samantha  Remember he started  Trashing the other people  On the network  Yeah because it used to be  Just like the type of  The channel that you see  In the hotel room  Yeah  Like you know  This is what's in the area  Yeah  This shop  With a little sound bed  A little sparkly sound bed  She's in a gondola  Yeah  You know but he came on  He was like  He trashed her  Rachel Ray  They gotta be panicking  If they're losing  Anthony Bourdain 
[03:28:00]  No  That's a big one  No  Who's they?  Adam Richman and Burt?  Well they got Adam Richman  They got Burt  They got Andrew Zimmerman  They might have  They might have somebody else  Oh really?  No I'm joking  No but where the fuck  Are you traveling to?  Jesus Chip  Jesus Chip  Why was I kidding?  Why don't you just  Go with the room for a second?  Yeah stop going against the green  It's not about you  We're having a good time  Yeah this is the  Sam Roberts and Friends show  Sam Roberts friends  And angry asshole Chip  Cause you are a fucking dick  Yeah your mother's a whore  Whatever 
[03:28:30]  Good one  Come back  What heads  Good one  Talk like the kids  It's important  The uh  Who's Andrew  Andrew Zimmerman  Andrew Zimmerman is a  Bizarre Foods guy  Oh okay  Yeah he's good  You know what's interesting  About him too  Is he did a whole show  That uh  He was homeless  He was a drug addict  In New York City  Homeless for a year  Really?  Back in the day  Yeah he was fucked up  And then he got his shit together  Became a chef  And he is who he is now  But yeah his show is cool too  I mean Bourdain's show  Bourdain did a lot of drugs too  Yeah but he kind of 
[03:29:00]  Does it on the show  For Christ's sake  I mean I don't know  Why I said did  I mean this season though  He is fucking shit faced  He used to be shit faced  By the end of the show  On the  You know but in this season  It's like he's fucking tanked  The beginning to the end  And he's just fucked  You can tell when somebody's  Fucked up  Yeah  On camera  Trying to keep their shit together  From the beginning of the  He's filming his intro  Yeah this  I actually like this show  Layover  I like that show a lot  This season of his  You know the  No Reservations is great too 
[03:29:30]  But Layover was great  Yeah he does good TV  Yeah I've heard he's great  Way better  Because it's not like  Typical chef shows  Right  Like he's not just like  Hey it's really weird  The food you can get here  He's like a person  Who's actually experiencing  This stuff  And he's a writer too man  If you listen to his show  He writes all the  Intros and outros  Yeah  They're kind of poetic  It's not basic horse shit  On cable TV  They're kind of poetic  Of these places  And the stuff that's filmed  Is not corny reality show  We took three takes  And this was the best one 
[03:30:00]  Type of stuff  You can tell  That he's just not  Willing to do it  Like he does  Like point the camera at me  And just pick up  What you pick up  Like pick up the experience  Of this  Yeah yeah  It's a fucking great show  It's I mean I can see  Why Travel Channel  Is going to be pissed  But they'll  There's something else now  You know FX was  You know the same thing  It's like these cable  Travel Channel FX  Discovery used to be shit  Now you know  All these shows have  Even Food Network  Is huge now  I think Food Network  I think Travel Channel  Is better than Food Network  The food shows 
[03:30:30]  On Travel Channel  Are better than  On Food Network  Fuck yeah  Travel Channel is way better  Food Network  Just plays Guy Fieri's show  All day  Do they really?  They play it all the time  But do you not like Guy Fieri?  Yeah I know  I hate him  Really?  I mean I got him to  Apologize to me twice  So I guess  For what?  Yeah I think he's okay  He's just being that guy  But he wasn't trying  To be a twat  What'd he do?  I don't know what he did  He fucked Sam in the mouth  He didn't fuck me  That's what I've done  Yeah I know  You're not mad at me  I was a willing participant  I was pretending  To not like it Bob  It's a game we play  Right  No and Guy Fieri 
[03:31:00]  If I hear you talk about  Sports on this show  One more time  Yeah  I'll fucking kill you  Why?  I want you talking about  Theater, movies and games  I talked about cats  Before on the show  You talk about cats  You ever fucking  Make my dick not hard  Why don't you want me  My opinion  Him talking about sports  Which just fucking  Bugged me the other day  By the way  Opie gave me and Sam  A beating this morning  And so did Anthony  About just how we were  Just so relaxed yesterday  And kind of felt like  We were in the zone  Talking  And they were both right  What a couple of fucking  Radio hack jizz bags we are 
[03:31:30]  Yesterday was a good show  I was listening yesterday  I liked it  Danica Patrick was very good  I didn't hear them  Trashing us  They did it  Can I just say something  And I might be  I think she was kind of  Flirting with you  Yeah you think so with me  I don't know  Not you you fucking  Fucking thing  Spit it out  I didn't know  She was just being nice  She was beautiful  And she smelled amazing  But no she was just  Being pleasant  Yeah but you say  You smell amazing  That's kind of weird  But she was like  Thank you  Well she was just  I heard she was a stiff interview  Like people are like 
[03:32:00]  I can't believe you guys  Got her to be that loose  I had never heard her interview  I thought she was a lot of fun  I didn't really know much about her  Me neither  She talked to her like a person  Yeah  Probably because she doesn't  Want to sit there  And answer  IndyCar and NASCAR questions  Dude it's the Sam Roberts  After show  That's what people relax here  They just chill  Yeah  She retweeted my picture with her  Did she?  So I don't know  If that counts as flirting  But  Is she following you?  No  But she did say  The question is  Whose hair is better?  Me or this mixed race thing  The way she phrased it  Was a little  Mutant 
[03:32:30]  I didn't put my picture up  I want to retweet from her  I am  Rick wants to talk to Bobby  Rick you're on after  Open Anthony Live  Oh good  Say hi to Mr. Habeas Corpus  That's right  Double motions bitch  That's a lot of knowledge  For you to have  Chip  I had no idea  You were so well versed  In our legal system  I hate Chip  Yeah  What's up Rick  Hey Bobby  How are you?

Hang on  Fez is in here  So why are you not doing your job?  Because Fez is in there  Because Fez asked me a question 
[03:34:00]  Can you just find out  If it's Andrew Zimmerman  Or Andrew Zim  What did you just call it?  Zimmern  Zimmern  Not Zimmerman stupid  Just shut up stupid  It's on the travel channel Iraq  Yeah before you get  Yeah I'm searching it right now  Before you get proven wrong  You dumb fucking idiot  Who is it?  What's his name?  It's Zimmern  Like I said  Z-I-M-M-E-R-N  Oh thank you Ritt  That's what they call him  On the travel  Do we have a prize for Ritt?  Bobo!  Bobo!  Do we have anything to give him? 
[03:34:30]  A book or anything?  He gets a piece of shit  He gets a piece of shit  Give him a copy of my book  Do you have one to give to him?  No  Alright well we can't give it to him then  Ritt  He gave it to Anthony Bourdain  We got 10 coming in for you guys though  Alright  Will you get your fucking baby fingernails off me?  I also want to talk to Coke Logic  Because I don't want to leave him on hold  He's a guest  No Coke Logic  I love Coke Logic  I like him  Let's not get crazy  I love him  I tolerate Coke Logic  I like Coke  I love Coke  C.L. in the house  Enough about Coke Logic  I love him  Why don't we talk to him?  I like Coke and I like Logic 
[03:35:00]  Mixed together  It's two great tastes  Just let him talk  Whenever I see Coke Logic  I just tap my nose  And go  What's up  This Logic  Oh god  I want to smash you  That's pretty fucking good  Thanks a lot  Thanks a lot  C.L.  What's up?  Hey I just want to know  What is the staff planning on doing  After the contract's not signed this weekend?  That's a great question  Coke Logic  I mean that has  Sam's coming on the  You Know What Dude podcast  Will I get a job?  We're going to give Jim his own show  On the Riotcast network  You won't give me my own show though? 
[03:35:30]  Called Chip and his friends  I think the contract will probably be signed this weekend  Because I think it would be a lot more hostile in here  If that was not the plan  However  Should it not be signed?  I don't know  I would probably start contacting people I've met through the show  And see if they can give me jobs  See if Sirius is interested in bringing on  After Opie and Anthony Live as its own entity  I would  And Bob?  I would invite you on my show  I would attempt that 
[03:36:00]  But if it didn't work  I would just go back to full-time stand-up  Yeah so you've got that to fall back on  I've kind of put all my eggs in this basket  I made more of my money doing stand-up  Than I do here  But that's what I  I don't even mean to fall back on  It's the wrong  You have a career  But one feeds the other  You would say, right?  Yeah  I mean you get five days of promotion  Oh, I doubt it helps  But now you've evolved  You're on Leno  You're on  You have other vehicles  Well Sam, it's funny you say that  You know  Is this some of that bullshit  That O&A were trashing us for?  Yeah  It's just some of this  This little ebb and flow  We feel 
[03:36:30]  Conversational  What's up, Bob?  Have you done  I'm doing  You know what I was thinking about doing, Jim?  If the contract doesn't get signed  Take some of our interviews  Danica Patrick  Joe Wall  Some of these great moments  And kind of feed them out  And see if there's an interest  In the Jim and Sam interview show  Yeah, the jam show  The jam show  Just because we have this natural chemistry  That just kind of flows through the radio  What's it called?  The jam  Jim and Sam  Morning jam  That kind of does work  You like it  The morning jam 
[03:37:00]  With  Jim and Sam  And how about this?  The morning jam  With  Jim and Sam  And Bob  No, Bob  You'll be like the stump boy  We got a Bob  He's over  Right out of the street  Bob  What are you seeing out there?  Your name will be  Jelly Kelly  And then we can go  It's the morning jam  With Jelly Kelly  Uh oh  I'm good  What's Jelly Kelly up to today?  Guys, I'm right here  At the opening  At a new Walmart  And uh  You know  There's a line  In front of Apple 
[03:37:30]  We'd steal man count  Oh, you're making fun of me, Bob  No, I love your video  Oh, thank you  I love the Apple 5  3.3 million views  Oh, that fucking annoys me  Why?  And Jim's been negative  About it all week  What have I?  You've been terrible  I don't care about viral videos  I think it's great  No, you don't  You've been saying  Every time it comes up  It's either  Well, it's all her  Or  Luckily it's not gonna lead anywhere  Or just  The worst possible things  You could say  Like any sort of  I mean, I know  They don't usually lead anywhere 
[03:38:00]  But this one could be something  And Jim goes  Yeah, well, I mean  It's great  It's not gonna do anything  But it's great  Yeah, exactly  What's he gonna do  He's terrible  He's probably gonna get you a show  Like the little kid  Charlie bit my finger  We see those kids all the time, don't we?  See what I mean?  No, we don't  He's terrible to have in my life  I love those kids  What did you think that show  Was gonna lead to something?  I don't know  Yeah, we do know  Hopefully that girl's suicide  Well, I mean  I'm not gonna  Just kidding  She was kinda cute  I thought she was sexy  Yeah  What?  She probably smelled under her arms  Yeah, but these are negative things 
[03:38:30]  You're bringing on  I like B.O.  I hate  Why do you like B.O.?  I just do  What kind of  Like really bad B.O.?  No, it's gotta be sexy  But a girl with underarm smell  Turns me on like a fucking light  Really?  Even if she's like  She looks filthy  Like she looks unbathed  Yeah, but  Not like sexually dirty  No  Like she needs  Like she's unhygienic  Yeah, but not like homeless  Do you like around her nose  And mouth is like yellow?  No, no, no, no  Face and breath have to be clean  I hate a dirty mouth  Hate it  She has to have good teeth  Good hygiene in the mouth  Yeah, yeah, yeah  But if she smells in the armpits 
[03:39:00]  She can't stink behind the ear  Like Voss  It didn't you wash back there  I'll say to her  Yeah, what if there's a little  Dirt collection behind there  Didn't you wash?  Exactly  Back of your neck, too  Yeah  Do you like  If your girl has a hemorrhoid  Does that gross you out?  Yeah, I don't love it  I mean  I'll push it like a button  I'll be like  What is this?  I'll start pushing it  I'll say floor five, please  Or she goes and has it lasered off  Honk, honk  Yeah  Like a bicycle bell  Yeah  Monah

Because John Walsh  And Joe Walsh  Are two separate people 
[03:42:30]  Joe Walsh played for the Eagles  And Jim and I interviewed him  Yes  Okay, then I'm gonna shit at that  Thank you, Glenn  That guy's from Boston, right?  Who, Joe Walsh?  No, this guy  That was just talking, you cunt  I hung up on him  I don't know  Sorry  Glenn  I'm sorry, I snapped at you  I didn't mean to snap  Don't worry about it  Sometimes it gets hostile  Yeah, it gets hostile  But no, it's relaxed  We're all sitting down  I would like every caller  To try to squeeze the phrase  Turnabout is fair play  Into a call  The challenge has been set  Fucking great  Because turnabout is fair play 
[03:43:00]  It's an awful  How'd you feel about Frank Oz  Complimenting Ant's questions today?  Very good  Yeah  Although what made me feel better  Was when he laughed  When I stole the thunder  That made me very happy  He did  And he hit you a couple times  He liked it  The more you didn't  I also saw you got happy  When Bob said  Yeah, but you could like  Take one word from every take  And just edit it together  And he was like  No, you can't  They did jump on the bandwagon  I told you  They did on my pilot  Did that?  Yeah  That's funny  Alright, let's see the challenge 
[03:43:30]  We've given people enough time  Yeah  Sabian  You're on after  Open Anthony Live  Sabian  Hey Sam  I met you over at WonderCon  Was it earlier in the summer?  Oh, cool  You were really cool  I also wanted to say hello to Bobby  I sent you the drawings of Patrice  And Bobby and Kelly  Oh, buddy, thank you  They're great  We have them in the studio  We have the one of Patrice in the studio  Awesome  I wanted to point out  The reason why he's laughing  Because I took it off 
[03:44:00]  One of the pictures that you have  On your Facebook profile  He's actually kind of  Sticking at his tongue  Through his teeth  He looked kind of silly  You had no choice to do that  The way I drew it  So I just  I modified it  Yeah, we have it in the studio  Framed  And anytime somebody  Is too wordy  Or says something stupid  We turn the photo of Patrice  Pointing at them  So they feel uncomfortable  Anything else to say, Sabian?  No, you guys are doing great  What a failed call  Failed call  You know  What do you have to say again? 
[03:44:30]  Turnabout is fair play  Of course  And every caller  Has to work that in somehow  Yes  Squeeze it in  Squeeze it in  I was on  Bob Kelly's  You know what dude podcast  He did  The current episode  Called Hybrid  Yeah  And it's available now  It's about you  There's a man  He's a woman  He's black  He's white  It's available now  At Riotcast.com  And the Riotcast app  Is out, correct?

And he's got it on a sex addict  Mark Zito  I had a girlfriend once tell me  Could you stop touching that?  I feel like I'm watching an addiction  I'm like, well you are  He's rubbing  Is it hard?  Is it plump?  Feel it  You just felt his dick  Why would you do that?  You're acting like I've never done it before  Is that the first time  You've touched his penis?  No  How many times?

It was all in the first hour  Of yesterday's show  Which I think  They do on demand now  If you go to SiriusXM.com  Yes, I got the new app  And it saves them  You can download the shows on demand  It's actually really cool  We bash the app a lot  But the on demand thing is awesome  I've heard it's very good  I love the app  What's wrong with the app?  I get  A lot of listeners 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, complain about it crashing  I've never had it crash ever  But the on demand function is amazing  The first hour yesterday  It was too  It was the character  The development of  Opie's sub-character of the Opster  That made me laugh too  Running around and  Trying to get a viral video  Like because Opie is this  Like established shock jock  Who's like  You know  He's the guy in radio  And the Opster is this  You know  Wet behind the ears  Green kid  Who's running around  With this video camera  No, the Opster is Opie internally  And it was funny 
[03:48:00]  When he goes  Yes, back to the drawing board  For the Opster  That really made me laugh  And the line he had before that  He goes  He goes  He goes  Something like  I guess it's just another one  That isn't going to cut it  Or something like that  When he was  Realizing that his viral video  Of a basketball trick  Is the same thing  That everybody else  Has already posted  Yeah  The other one  Are you a viral video  I'd like to see  Of Opie and Anthony  Signing contracts  That would be nice  That's a viral video  I'd love to see  So they won't let  You can't sign a contract  Until they do  No, Sirius looks at me

[03:55:30]  Yeah  And Jess and me  Are in the hotel room  And my phone goes off  And she goes  Who is it  And I was like  It's Edgar  Telling me to get back to work  That the honeymoon is over  And she looks at it  And she goes  How can you tell that's Edgar  And I go  Because  The characters write phonetically  And she goes  Well how do you know  That's not Chip then  And I go  Cause Chip doesn't talk like that  Jess  Edgar is bothering us  The fact  In Hawaii 
[03:56:00]  In Kauai  You can't  And you try to explain  And this is what sucks  My wife loves  Every character  This asshole does  What?  My wife hates every character  This asshole does  My wife loves Chip  So much  This fucking knucklehead  Will do Chip  And she'll be like  Double guns Chip  And he  Double guns  And she does Chip  Like  No  Dude we're driving  I'm telling you  All the time  Anytime we're going back to Boston  She'll fucking see some stupid thing on the road  She'll go  Yeah that's crazy 
[03:56:30]  The way that had to  Yeah  Double guns  And I want to  I want to kick her out the fucking door  I really want to open up the fucking door  And with one leg  Just fucking boot her out  Cause you don't want that in your private life  That's invading your marriage  I don't want my wife doing Chip  I love that Sam had to look at me during his vows  For a half a second  Cause Edgar was threatening to object  Like whenever  When  Does anyone object  Edgar was threatening  I'm going to object  You've planned 
[03:57:00]  You've planned a wedding Bob  Yes  You understand it's a stressful time  No because I  I did just me and her  Oh that's right  We did that thing over the internet  Well we were planning a real  Like a big  A real big wedding  I would imagine  And so there's all these details  And all this stuff  And uh  Yeah  It was a beautiful wedding by the way  You weren't there  Oh yeah  Forgot about that  Go ahead  I'm sorry  I didn't get an e-vite  To watch your wedding on the internet  So why would I  I mean  Think that we were close enough  For me to give you an actual invitation  You got the e-vite  I didn't get an e-vite  No I didn't 
[03:57:30]  I don't know  You didn't even send me a copy of your book  You said you would  First of all  We weren't fucking back then  Alright  Alright  That's a fair enough point  By the time you were getting married  We were already into it  Okay  I just thought it'd be weird  And your book's coming  I got ten copies coming tomorrow  Yeah but you told me months ago  You were going to send me a copy  Because you wanted my opinion  And then you never even sent that  But to us  How much do you really value my opinion  Not my fault  No  No  Your name's on the cover  What were you saying  Anyway  As I'm trying to plan this wedding  Edgar is texting me 
[03:58:00]  Like at least every couple weeks  Yeah  Letting me know  That he plans on coming to the wedding  In Edgar speak of course  And objecting to it  Because  Oh  I'm so happy  And I showed it to Jess  Because Jessica is a girl of lower stock  She's a woman of lower stock  And Jess is like  What?  And I go  This is what he's writing  I don't know  And so  And so my dad married us  And as he's  You know  He's saying  No do you  If anybody has anything to say right now 
[03:58:30]  My dad was even being a little  Tongue in cheek about it  Because who's going to object at this wedding?  I asked for a split second  I think direct eye contact with Norton  He just had this  Ear to ear  Toothy grin  On his face  Because he knew  Jesus  At the moment of matrimony  The I do  Edgar is in my head  And I'm sitting there wondering  Because I know he wouldn't  But would he?  He wouldn't do that  But would he do that?  Oh god  And Jess like  When she hung out with Norton 
[03:59:00]  At the compound  She's like  Oh I loved hanging out with Jim  And talking to him  He's a good guy  He's actually fun to hang out with  But she hates the characters  She hates them  She hated me for a long time  Because she didn't understand me  But she didn't know you  She thought I was a dick  My wife loves Jim  She's not a vulgar girl  Loves Chip  Loves  Loves  Loves all the stupid characters  Chip the best though  Yeah  She loves Chip  She'll talk to him  As Chip  Yeah  She'll be like  How you doing Chip?
