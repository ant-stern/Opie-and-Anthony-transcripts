<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a chaotic start, plagued by significant technical difficulties involving headphones and audio levels.  The hosts reacted with profuse profanity to the frustrating situation.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of Jimmy Norton's recent appearance on Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld. Norton recounted his experience, detailing the challenges of using a teleprompter and his interactions with fellow guests Ann Coulter, Juliet Huddy, and Bill Schulz.  Clips from Norton’s Red Eye appearance were played, showcasing humorous segments about the BP oil spill and an Iranian cleric’s views on dogs and women’s attire.  The conversation touched upon the guests' political views and their post-show activities.  Further clips featured Norton's monologue on China surpassing the US in manufacturing, prompting a discussion about American exceptionalism and self-perception.  Norton also shared anecdotes about his struggles finding late-night food in Times Square and attending the Louis C.K. show premiere, leading to discussion of the show and Bob Kelly’s acting.  Adam Ferrara’s new car show was also briefly mentioned, with humorous comments about Ferrara's driving skills.

A major segment focused on a legal battle between the Naked Cowboy and a female impersonator, Sandy Cain ("Naked Cowgirl").  Audio of an interview with the Naked Cowboy about the lawsuit and Cain's alleged brand infringement was played.  The hosts played an old recording of Anthony Cumia singing a "Naked Cowboy" song from his previous band.  The segment included highly sexually suggestive and vulgar commentary about Cain's appearance and the Naked Cowboy's business practices.  Doctors Steve and Mike were called to discuss a growth on Cain’s body ("Twato"), their conversation punctuated with vulgar and sexually explicit jokes.

The show revisited past "What the Hell is That?" segments featuring unusual medical conditions, including a particularly disturbing case of a man fearing mouth cancer, with Dr. Mike recounting his discomfort. Dr. Steve’s infamous “bit” involving rectal finger insertion and urine drinking was also mentioned.  The discussion shifted back to Sandy Cain, focusing on her apparent resentment towards the show, possibly stemming from past incidents involving damaged equipment, which the hosts defended as part of comedic bits resulting in upgrades for Cain. A caller shared a negative encounter with Cain in Times Square. The hosts then briefly discussed Andrew Lloyd Webber's daughter and his musicals, transitioning into a discussion of the phrase "back in the day."

A significant portion focused on "Intern Derek," a racist intern sent to Harlem as punishment for his views.  The hosts and Troy Kwan recounted this experience, highlighting Derek's stupidity, his inability to follow instructions, and the dangerous situations he created. Audio clips from Harlem showcased Derek interviewing residents, their responses to his insensitive questions about race, President Obama, and slang terms were played and discussed.  The hosts also mentioned another problematic former intern, Harry T.  The segment further discussed a doctor using a hidden camera in his bathroom, and the hosts' reactions to Derek’s behavior.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a CNBC segment featuring Mark Haynes making a sexist joke and the "dick slang" dance.

A segment featured Jim Brewer, in-studio, recounting violent encounters during Memorial Day weekend in Wildwood, New Jersey, primarily involving Latino individuals.  He detailed street brawls, drug use, and threats against him and his family.  A caller questioned the show’s focus on inner-city individuals for comedic effect, with the hosts suggesting that wealthier areas yielded less "funny" audio.  The conversation also covered the anxieties and challenges of parenthood, focusing on Brewer's experiences with a newborn and the unexpected reactions of new parents.  The hosts discussed the differences in raising boys versus girls.  The segment also mentioned Norton's SiriusXM show, Ozzy Osbourne's new album, and a previous subway encounter.  The conversation frequently included expletives and racially charged language.

Jim Brewer continued sharing stories, including a near-violent altercation, criticizing police response, and recounting marital troubles and his wife's conversion to a devout Christian faith. He humorously detailed attending a Chris Tomlin concert, contrasting his cynicism with the audience's enthusiasm.  A significant portion involved his escalating conflict with "Pizza Man," a contentious neighbor, including legal battles and multiple confrontations. A caller corroborated Brewer's account. The segment concluded with a final passive-aggressive encounter with Pizza Man and a recounted breakfast with James Hetfield of Metallica, juxtaposed with the reaction of his wife's devout Christian friend.  A caller identified himself as a business partner of that friend's husband.

The final segment featured a conversation with Jim Brewer, including an attempted skit and a contentious exchange about Brewer’s Christianity.  Brewer was called a "faggot." The discussion broadened into a critique of US political discourse, focusing on the manipulative nature of news media and its role in fostering division. Brewer expressed skepticism towards established political categories and provided examples illustrating alleged political manipulation at the local level.  The conversation touched upon 9/11 conspiracy theories, with Brewer expressing doubts about the official narrative.  The segment ended with promotion of Brewer’s upcoming shows and a 7-Eleven advertisement.

[00:10:00]  ass people don't like them and he's proving why he did give most of his money to obama oh yeah he did  that so don't be too soft on but actually instead of ask the british prefer bum if we're going to  do the vernacular true true just make sure we're correct on this oh guys it's getting a little heated  here just take it down a notch please  but that aunt coulter likes to tip a few back oh really i like i like that gal did you guys go out 
[00:10:30]  afterwards yeah there's like 12 of us that went out it was uh her and her she had a friend with her  i juliet and her boyfriend and just bill a bunch of people yeah just uh but the television industry  though it's just people that like to really they like to party television people are known  for liking to just go out and and tip a few oh this is a picture of ann and anthony oh yes that's  wonderful look at us uh where was that like what bar close to the year right yeah it's pretty close 
[00:11:00]  is it outdoors no the whole front is open though oh i see we're like inside but we're right next to  where it opens up did you and ann coulter get along over a few beverages yeah you know we were yapping  about some things some things but uh yeah you know we share the same political ideology for the most  part oh you think a lot of people saw that picture and said it's nice to see um uh adolf and ava  together again what's her drink of choice i don't know some kind of orange juice stuff 
[00:11:30]  yeah so i think it was vodka no j maybe some screwdrivers a few screwdrivers screwdrivers  and i was just having a couple of guinness does she get recognized everywhere everywhere she goes i  didn't i don't know if she did last time i'm sure she did well she had her back to the street there so  um right a lot of people walking by but um actually a couple of fans of the show as they were  has a model again oh really leave me alone shut up jackass uh norton talks to the guest about a 
[00:12:00]  cleric in iran banning dogs as pets and saying women should be better covered was the cleric correct  about our obsession with dogs do we sometimes treat them better than we treat our families uh  yeah but i've seen some websites here in the united states that uh have friendships with dogs that  should be banned it's good for the dogs you ever see their ringing dog whisperer use a machete and 
[00:12:30]  electric testicle clips good for the dogs it's it's in their best interest it's better for them not  of course the iranian dog whispers don't whisper into their ears it ain't good it ain't good juliette  follow that juliette let's cut the malarkey here and get down to business should we respect their  religious customs of covering women's head from head to toe head women's head from head to toe  from head to chin they're naked except they're shins to heads i don't you wish all of them were like that i don't know it was talking about like letting their 
[00:13:00]  letting their hair hang out and interestingly mah Lyman mahmoud Ahmadinejidz he was the one who actually  came in and said hold on hold on he wants to ease up on some of these um restrictions which i found  interesting since he is a hell on earth but it's kind of like he's iron man in a way he's flawed  yet he comes in and sort of saves the day it's crazy I think it's something different I think it's because any  cleric who would notice the fashionableness of a woman's veil is totally gay oh yeah totally right 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, I think Mahmoud is just worried about the clerics going gay.  I call him Maki.  Maki.  And Akhmadinejad is a good guy to talk to about fashion.  He's a sociopath and a members-only jacket.  A good time had by all.  Yeah, the energy was very good.  Absolutely.  Yeah, definitely a lot of fun.  And you're doing a good job hosting, Jimmy.  Thanks.  Well, you have the question in the monitor in front of you, so you kind of know.  And you have them on paper, so you kind of know where you want to go. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  But everybody was funny and talkative and giving good answers.  It's awkward if someone's not giving anything.  Yeah.  But with, like, Ant and Ann Coulter and Julia, it's like you know all that are comfortable talking.  Sure.  And Jimmy kept the energy up and everything.  It was really fun.  Yeah.  It was cool.  Even with Meatloaf, which, you know, it's kind of hard to interview Meatloaf.  How was the Meatloaf interview?  It was good.  I mean, he's a little nuts, but, yeah, I think he had fun.  Yeah, he was crazy.  I think he did enjoy it, though.  In the dressing room, it's like he's standing around, and then he goes,  should I wear this, and puts his jacket on with the silver studded skulls? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  It's like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's the one you want to.  Yeah, definitely you got to wear that one.  That's the one you want to wear.  What was he promoting?  Probably the same one that we had.  It's probably the same one that's not selling.  Aw.  I don't know.  You think not?  Poor Meat.  Maybe not.  We all love the meat, but.  Jesus.  Who doesn't love the meat?  We love the meat.  Yeah, maybe it's not.  As long as it's not in the shape of a cock.  Oh, what?  What's the name of the CD? 
[00:15:00]  Hang Cool Teddy Bear.  Yeah, didn't he say it?  Yeah, that was it.  He said something, like it was his best album ever.  He had some.  Well, of course.  He was promoting it pretty heavily on our show.  I don't know how it's doing.  Then Jimmy asked him what Hang Cool Teddy Bear means, and I didn't understand his answer.  I didn't either.  I didn't listen as well as I probably should have, because you're so.  Yeah, like fixated on what you're going to say next.  What's next, and where do we go?  Oh, and I'm listening for Todd in my ear, telling me things like, all right, 30. 
[00:15:30]  Because you have to know when to jump out.  Oh, sure.  That was the weird part.  It was coming in out of breaks.  All right.  Yeah.  And finally, Jim's monologue.  This is the Greg.  What does Greg Gutfeldt call it?  The Greg-a-log.  The Greg-a-log.  Don't play the whole thing.  I can't listen to it.  That means we've got to play the whole thing.  No, I can't.  Oh.  That means we've got to play the whole thing.  Jimmy's uncomfortable.  Did it say Norton and Friends on the thing?  I wanted them to say Norton and Friends on the graphics.  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right, you lucky devils. 
[00:16:00]  It's time for my monologue.  I didn't want to name it something ham-handed or cheesy like Jim-a-log.  So I settled on reporting Norton.  Horrible.  By the way, as I said that, my head should have blown off.  And they're replaced by a more awesome head.  You are awesome.  Anybody.  It's John Merrick.  According to IHS Global Insight, thank you, Bill, in 2011, China's going to pass the United  States as the world's largest manufacturer. 
[00:16:30]  Now, should this be surprising considering that China has over a billion people and the  average wage for labor is somewhere between $100 and $150 a month?  Now, instead of Americans feeling bad about ourselves, we ought to be saying, hey, it's  about time.  What took you idiots so long?  $150 a month?  In America, you can't get a happy-ending massage for that much.  At least not in a good place.  In a good place, the massage itself is $150 and anything after that is discussed privately  between you and the lady.  If indeed she is a lady.  Who hasn't made that mistake?  The point is, why do we as Americans take any instance of not being the greatest on the 
[00:17:00]  planet?  We take that and we make it an epic failure, which is the main reason the United States  has never embraced soccer, because we can't be the best at it in the world.  That, and because soccer really sucks and is boring to watch.  But why do we set such impossible standards for ourselves to live up to?  Can't we just be happy knowing we've created almost everything fun that exists on the planet  already?  The telephone, television, personal computers, bifocals, the internet, and even Barbie dolls. 
[00:17:30]  And these are just the things I use to act out sexually.  Let's not forget air conditioning, light bulbs, the automobile, and Tupperware, which are also  things I've used to act out sexually.  We've gotten to a point in America where we seem to think being second best makes us a  turd in the punch bowl of the world.  We're like a nation of teenagers walking up the stairs while the great Santini bounces a  basketball at the back of our heads.  So instead of feeling bad about ourselves when China passes us in manufacturing,  why don't we just congratulate them?  Because without America, there'd be nothing worth manufacturing in the first place. 
[00:18:00]  And if you disagree with me, then you're probably a racist homophobe who's never seen the great Santini.  Amazing.  That was Report Norton.  You're welcome.  No one's talking to me.  Sometimes I just go, ah, divine inspiration.  I don't run this thing.  Christ does. 
[00:18:30]  And he said, talk to your guests.  And how do you feel about China possibly passing us?  It was weird because Todd was, I didn't realize there was nothing on the thing after.  So I had to just go to them for two minutes of discussion about China.  Yeah, there was no real questions.  It was just kind of, hey, what does anybody else think?  Right, right.  And then it was just quiet.  And Todd goes, you got two minutes.  I was like, oh.  You got two minutes.  Go.  Two more minutes.  Go.  Very good, man.  Good job, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  Good job, man.  Yeah, I was happy with that.  It was fun. 
[00:19:00]  Very enjoyable.  I think we might have more clips later on in the show.  So we'll see.  It's embarrassing to listen to myself.  I get very embarrassed.  Just watch the fucking thing.  I get very embarrassed.  Aw.  Shy.  You're a sweet boy.  That's what everyone's been saying lately.  Into my itchy asshole.  My asshole right now.  Oh, is it?  Oh, feels like there's a fucking centipede pop locking.  In between my cheeks.  One wipe takes care of that, though, man.  One lousy wipe.  Well, you need one of those wet wipes. 
[00:19:30]  You make your own.  A little water under the faucet with the teepee.  I don't know.  Then you get that.  There's not too much water, though.  You get that.  Make it just slightly damp.  And one wipe.  And you'll be good to go.  You'll be back in the game.  Pop locking.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Yeah.  And then I, you know, you think about the great Times Square in New York, right? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, believe me.  You're not a fan of Times Square, are you?  No, I'm not.  All right.  Good.  But you'd assume that even at like one in the morning, that there'd be a place to fucking  eat.  Mm-hmm.  No.  They close everything down, my friend.  It's like, you know, it's fucking New York, New York.  The city that never sleeps.  That never sleeps.  Well, apparently it's going to bed a little earlier these days, because I was looking  for something to eat.  I'm wandering around like a fucking bum. 
[00:20:30]  Like a bum.  Trying to find something to eat.  Did you find any food?  Not really.  I had to go all the way down to fucking 9th and 52nd to a diner that way down there.  It's the only place that was open.  By yourself?  You would think, yeah, you would think, you know, that there was something going on.  Nothing.  That's weird.  Walking around.  Figured I'd talk to myself.  Just blah, blah, blah. 
[00:21:00]  Blah.  But there's, you know.  I know most of the city closes down, but I'd figure, you're right, that Times Square would  just stay open all night long now.  Yeah, you would think something like at least one place would just stay open and have food  so somebody would, you know.  They would do business with the late night crowd.  I guess they're afraid of being robbed.  Who the fuck knows?  I don't know.  Nah.  I, uh...  Paying me ass.  I went to the premiere of Louis C.K.'s show last night.  Ooh!  Oh, at the college. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, Robert Kelly wrote me.  He's like, you coming, dude?  I'm like, ah...  Last minute, I went down there.  Was Steve out front selling bootleg copies of the program?  Yeah, Louis C.K. didn't seem too happy yesterday when he started counting how many copies we  have alone.  No.  And Steve thinks it's okay just to dub a few off, but that's how it starts.  That's how it starts, yeah.  Because my copy really is in Philly, and I don't know what they're doing with it.  Yeah, run it off.  I didn't give them any instructions.  You know, I assume they probably won't run off a couple, but they probably will just 
[00:22:00]  run off one or two more off that dub.  That's just how it works.  That's why these studios don't want any copies out there.  No!  Because it gets in the wrong hands.  One guy.  You could just make...  All of a sudden, thousands are out there.  Correct.  Thousands of digital copies.  No, but Caroline's did the right thing.  Set up the premiere for Louis' new show.  Did the pilot in the first show.  The first show Bob Kelly's in, as his brother, he played it very, very well. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, Bob's good, man.  And what's his name?  The guy that looks like Eddie Trunk on Curb Your Enthusiasm.  I always forget his name.  Jeff Garland or whatever his name.  It looks like Eddie Trunk.  What's his name?  Jeff Garland.  Came right up to Bobby after his episode and said, holy crap, you could act.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And wouldn't leave it alone.  Let me tell you how you get to be an actor.  Yeah.  Well, Bobby was humble.  I mean, he plays a pretty shocking scene in the first episode. 
[00:23:00]  There's a pilot in the first episode.  And after a lot of the, I want to call them bits, but segments of the show, huge laughs.  After Bobby's scene, not so much.  And Bobby is sitting right next to me and he's getting all uncomfortable.  I'm like, don't you understand?  That scene wasn't supposed to get huge laughs.  It was more shocking.  The stuff you were saying.  Dude, I'm a method actor, dude.  You know, you go in, boom.  You blow your lines out.  You know what, dude?  You got your Strasburg. 
[00:23:30]  You got your Stanislavski.  Boom, dude.  You know what, dude?  You kind of feel it.  Boom.  You do a little repetition.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  You're tired.  You see him pontificating about his acting style.  Yeah.  He whispers to me, well, that went well.  I'm like, you're missing what this scene's all about.  This scene is about, yeah.  I guess he really wanted the whole room to just die laughing, but it just wasn't one of those scenes.  The laughs were there, absolutely.  And he was bummed until Jeff Garland came up to him afterward and said, dude, man, holy crap, you could act. 
[00:24:00]  So it was more an acting scene than a...  Yeah, he plays Louie's brother in this new show, so I guess he gets two or three shows out of it.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, right on.  And, yeah, the people at Caroline's loving the new show, which starts a week from tonight on FX.  They have to rescue me.  Definitely.  So.  Ooh.  They have to rescue me.  Yeah, speaking of that, Adam Ferrara's got a show on, I think it might even be on the Speed Channel or something.  And this is ridiculous, because I've known Adam for years. 
[00:24:30]  He takes, like, high-performance cars and drives them, and, you know, comments about them and shit.  And the other day he was on, he was on, like, some kind of, yeah, Top Gear, it's called.  Top Gear.  Is he the host?  It's an English show, but it's, they kind of adapted it to the United States, and he's the host.  And it's twisted, because I know Adam.  He can't fucking drive.  So how do you get this gig?  He's very good.  And he got the gig, and he's driving, like, he calls up the other day, he's like, yeah, I was doing about 180 in a Lamborghini. 
[00:25:00]  Wow.  Like, fucking, you can't, I've been in your car.  You suck.  You can't drive.  I saw Adam in the airport when he first started filming that.  We just happened to come back from L.A. on the same flight.  And we took a cab, the car back to the city, and he was talking about the new show.  Yeah.  So now he calls me up, and he goes, he left a message, I gotta get back to him.  He goes, yeah, I'm making a battle tank out of a Subaru Brat. 
[00:25:30]  He goes, I'm gonna use, like, paintball things and stuff.  He goes, I need your advice on windage and elevation.  Jesus.  He goes, okay, you nut.  Yeah, because he, and he lived in the city for the last ten or so years, so he doesn't have a car.  City guys don't really drive anymore, you lose your skills.  And he always had a shitty car, right?  Well, he kind of had, was he a gearhead at all?  That's just it, not at all.  It was terrible.  His father, Big Joe, would just goof on him all the time, like, what are you doing? 
[00:26:00]  Right.  Shut the hood and get someone in there that knows what they're doing.  Good for Adam.  And he would get lost everywhere he went.  Huh.  We'd have to talk him in.  And this was back in the, you know, the pre-cell phone days.  Back when we were both working slobs.  And he was just, you know, it was like, he'd have to stop at a pay phone.  Where are you?  Oh, God, you're right around the corner a half hour later.  Where are you?  I don't know.  Good for Adam. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Does he have a big part on Rescue Me this coming season?  Yeah, I saw him in the trailer.  I would assume so.  I saw him in the trailer for it.  He's got all his fireman equipment on.  That's great.  Yeah.  He's a good shit dad, Adam.  Well, he should take you for a ride in one of these shows.  He wants to.  That's what he said.  He goes to these tracks up in, like, Watkins Glen, and they just blast around in high-performance  vehicles.  I'm right on.  He's like, all right, I'm in.  It is on Speed Channel?  It's produced by BBC, but it's on Speed Channel. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, on Speed Channel.  Yeah, that's cool.  That's for my pal, Adam.  Adam Ferreira.  I see a couple of topics here that first one is great, because I was waiting for this  to happen.  I can't believe it hasn't happened sooner.  I know.  Well, you can thank Sam for this.  Sam is the reason why.  Are you talking about the naked cowboy?  Yes.  Sam's the reason.  Is he really? 
[00:27:30]  And are we getting Sandy Cain on the show today?  Did you guys try calling?  Where's your papers?  Where's your papers?  Where's the papers?  Where's the papers?  Jim Brewer's in today, by the way.  I might as well plug Jim coming in.  No, that's not it.  Can I have the other paper?  Not this one.  8, 830.  Right.  Can I have your version?  Is it in the paper?  Yeah.  8 o'clock.  Oh, yeah.  It's in the paper.  It's like, no, the other.  Jim's at the Stress Factory. 
[00:28:00]  Friday, June 25th.  Saturday, June 26th.  All day, get situated.  It's at 732-545-HA-HA.  Those shows are going to sell out immediately.  Absolutely.  So if you don't have Jim Brewer tickets, fuck yourself with a stick with a fire on it.  Do that anyway, please?  I think he's just coming in to say hi.  Yeah, Brewer does not need help selling tickets.  I don't think he's going to have a problem with the tickets.  I would like to see Jim's act.  I haven't...  He said we did Traveling Virus.  He was hilarious.  Yeah.  I haven't seen Jim on stage in a long time.  Yeah.  Now I can't find the fucking story. 
[00:28:30]  Story.  Steery.  Story.  And pass this over.  It is there.  Is that the whole story?  Oh, there's a story right there.  The paper.  The paper, the paper.  Oh, no.  But here's the better version, because they have the...  Do they have her picture?  They have the tail of the tape.  Oh, no.  So this is big news.  Oh, is that...  I flipped through the...  Oh, wow.  This is big news, and indirectly, we have everything to do with this.  I wouldn't implicate myself like that.  Huh?  Let Sam get fucking countersued.  Sam brought it to the Naked Cowboy's attention, and we got the audio, which leads to the big article in the paper. 
[00:29:00]  Oh.  Oh.  We never knew before this...  Yeah.  How does that guy not...  According to Sam, maybe Sam could explain.  Uh, Underoo Buckaroo's bid to boot copycat gal.  Times Square isn't big enough for the two of them.  Well.  The Naked Cowboy claims a bawdy, bikini-clad female busker, who calls herself the Naked Cowgirl, is ripping off his shtick, and he's threatening to lasso her into court for as much as $150,000. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't have that.  Yeah.  She hasn't made that much.  She hasn't made that much in her life.  Never.  She's the Naked Cow cadaver.  People have thrown quarters at her head.  You know what?  We might have to play Sam's audio before we read the article, because you started this, I think, right?  There, Sam.  How long ago, Sam?  It was...  He was in here, like, two weeks ago.  Oh.  And, uh...  And, yeah, he didn't realize, I don't think, that Sandy was going on the radio and promoting herself.  Oh, really? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, he thought she was just some kind of kook walking around.  He knew about her?  Yeah, he knew about her, but I think he was caught off guard when I knew about her.  Ah.  Because all I asked him about was her.  So he probably thought...  Oh, you asshole.  He probably thought it was just some kind of almost homeless lady.  How much money could she possibly make, be making out there?  And I just kept asking him...  A non-issue, really.  ...why he's letting her do it for free.  He should be charging her.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Wow. 
[00:30:30]  Okay, in so many words.  Like this whole franchise, yeah.  Right, all right.  So this is Sam's quick interview with the Naked Cowboy.  Sam Roberts.  On the scene.  Glorified panhandler.  The Naked Cowboy was at SiriusXM.  Sam Roberts was on the scene.  Naked Cowboy.  As far as Times Square performers, do you know Sandy Cain?  Absolutely.  The Naked Cowgirl?  Absolutely.  She's not an official license of the brand, but she probably is going to have to sign a  franchise agreement as she's continuing to create greater media opportunities for her 
[00:31:00]  and to keep it, you know, legit.  Again, it's a franchise agreement.  It's $500 a month or $5,000 a year.  That's the appropriate way for her to be working.  She has not done that, but at the same time, you know, I don't want to take the shirt off  her back.  I know the most effective part of my industry, my, you know, from Naked Cowboy Oysters to  Naked Cowboy Tequila to the Naked Cowboy Reality Show, and I could go on all day, licenses  all over the world, and the branding.  I forgot what I was saying.  Just that basically Sandy Cain owes you about $500 a month. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  Again, as she's doing more stuff and actually creating legitimate, you know, product that  she'll actually make money from, in order to do that, she'll sign a franchise agreement.  Finally, justice comes to geriatric stripper and O&A regular Sandy Cain.  Hopefully, she'll go broke with Sam Roberts on the scene.  Jesus.  Wow.  All right.  I didn't know you could buy a franchise.  Yeah, you could be the Naked Anthony if you want to. 
[00:32:00]  So, if I wanted to do that.  Yes.  Franchise, all he needs is a bottle of tequila.  Good delivery, Jim.  Sorry, Anthony.  Well, how long has he been doing this?  I mean, at least...  10 years.  10 years.  Yeah.  Easily.  How about we go back about 16, 17 years ago and have Anthony with his band Rotcut wearing 
[00:32:30]  a cowboy hat and underwear singing a song called Naked Cowboy.  How about that, motherfucker?  He owes you $500 a month.  How about he owes me money?  Do we have that song in the system?  Travis is getting it.  Travis is getting it.  Naked Cowboy.  And I would do it in a cowboy hat.  I remember.  Boots and nothing but my underwear and get out on stage and sing this fucking song.  Dude, you should take down the Naked Cowboy.  So, I am the original Naked Cowboy, motherfucker. 
[00:33:00]  You're the kingpin.  Yes.  Here's Anthony from many years ago and Brother Joe.  Oh, I'm a little embarrassed to say.  Why's that?  Come on out of your shell.  Ah, well, ever since I was a youngin', there's the one thing I've always wanted to be.  Why don't you tell us about it?  Why would I be a Naked Cowboy?  Well, I'd rather be in the nude.  I just wear my boots, my cowboys and suits. 
[00:33:30]  And it rocks to my books and black and blue.  Well, I want to be a Naked Outlaw.  I would rather back in the rock.  I just wear my hat, give you a match and match.  It's first of all they can sing, you sing a song.  Well, right.  Naked needs a pedal.  Well, right.  Naked on the plate.  Well, right.  Completely naked on dress, burst on my horse, till I am in pain.  Well, I want to be a Naked Weston Hero. 
[00:34:00]  Looking but my older at my side.  I'll ride on out of town.  I just don't want to sit down.  All you see is the thug in my behind.  Well, right.  Naked into pedal.  Well, right.  Naked on the plate.  Well, right.  Completely naked on dress, burst on my horse, till I am in pain.  Then I mosey. 
[00:34:30]  It's good.  The drummer's good, too.  I love the drummer, man.  I got stairs and jangle, jangle, jangle.  Was that an original song?  Yeah.  Oh, it was.  Hold it, hold it, hold it, jump in G-Hosey, fat.  What in tarnation is that crap?  Well, I want to be a wild imposter.  Covering my privacy, my gun.  I've missed it back in the platoons, I was shining on the moon. 
[00:35:00]  This is how the way she'd have been won.  Well, right.  Naked into pedal.  Well, right.  Naked on the plate.  Well, right.  Keep blinking naked on dress, burst on my horse, till I am in pain.  There.  There you go.  That was the original naked cowboy.  Wow.  Not him.  Eric, why'd you bring up a picture of Carole King singing?  That isn't my naked cowboy attire.  That was the rest of the gig, where I'd have nothing but boxer shorts and suspenders on. 
[00:35:30]  And a giant afro that I know Sam is jealous of.  Very jealous.  Oh, of course.  You could get your afro like that.  Back in the day.  Mine doesn't come down the way ants did.  No.  Why am I grabbing my cock in that picture?  Jesus.  You're probably just covering up a boner.  Yeah, the boner.  The boner.  The boner.  So you're the original naked cowboy.  Yes.  I should take this motherfucker to court.  For a goof, you should.  You should. 
[00:36:00]  You should just get involved with this lawsuit.  Throw myself into it.  Absolutely.  So the naked cowboy is suing a friend of the show, Sandy Cain, the naked cowgirl, thanks  to Sam, for $150,000, or he's hinting at that.  The cowboy, whose real name is Robert Burke, sent a cease and desist letter to his foil,  Sandy Cain, a fixture of the city, comedy scene, and former stripper, famous for closing  her act by lighting her breasts on fire.  Paper had to write that today.  They had to put that in there. 
[00:36:30]  Uh, your use of naked cowgirl is essentially identical to the naked cowboy and is clearly  in violation of Burke's trademark, read the letter.  Uh, Burke is demanding that Cain, who began appearing in Times Square in a red, white, and  blue cowboy hat and matching bikini several years ago, either stop making money off of  his trademark or sign a naked cowboy franchise agreement.  Who the fuck would sign one of those?  A naked cowboy franchise agreement.  Wow, that's just as good as having a McDonald's, I'm sure.  No, if she's going to sell stuff and make money off it, then yeah, she's going to have 
[00:37:00]  to pay, Burke said.  And he charges, uh, $5,000 a year or $500 a month for a franchise, a naked cowboy franchise.  How do you franchise panhandling?  I mean, honestly, the guy is, he's a panhandler with a gimmick is where he figured out how  to go into Times Square and have people give him money, uh, for just standing there in 
[00:37:30]  his underwear and a cowboy hat and a guitar.  You know, we mock him, but God bless him because he did figure it out and he's got dummies.  He's got dummies paying the franchise fee.  So what, like there's a Chicago naked cowboy that hangs out wherever the homeless people  hang out there and, and just fucking plays guitar?  Well, he's a weird, everybody, he's a really weirdly famous guy.  Everybody knows who the naked cowboy is.  Yeah, yeah.  It's odd, right?  It is odd.  Famous for doing just about nothing.  He stands there in a hat and his boots, it looks like he's naked from the front because 
[00:38:00]  he's got a guitar and blocking his dick and balls and asshole.  And it's a fascinating story about how he has to wear two pairs of underwear.  That's right.  Uh, he would wear one and the police would always make him cover up.  So he put on a second pair of underwear to hide his bulge.  To push the cack down.  Yeah, you've got to keep that cack down.  Push the cack down.  When you ask him about that stuff, he just starts making, uh, double entendre jokes and  thinks about, like, saying...  Oh, no.  Yeah, they busted me, but it was a hung jury. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, get it?  Like a cack.  He was in Playgirl.  Was he?  I think that's where he got his story up.  Yeah?  Good for him.  Uh, Burke's manager.  He's got a manager, too.  Holy shit.  Todd Rubenstein.  Of course.  He's got a jib.  He's got a jib.  He's a cowboy.  He's naked.  Yeah.  Come on.  Said they would be willing to negotiate an individual deal with Kane.  Another woman who bills herself as the naked cowgirl, Louisa, I guess, is a licensed 
[00:39:00]  franchisee, according to Rubenstein.  Oh, I don't think they really wanted to sue Sandy.  He just, he wants...  He's just looking for publicity.  He knows she's a kook.  Yeah.  She's an old kook.  Really?  An old kook?  Ready for this?  But Kane, a 50-something New Jersey native...  Wait, what was this article written in, like, 1971?  Last we checked, she was well into her 60s.  Oh, for sure.  Late 60s.  Late 60s, right?  Well, the paper's saying Kane, a 50-something New Jersey native whose real name is Sandra 
[00:39:30]  Brodsky, said she doesn't see why she has to pay Burke a cent.  Eh.  I don't see why I gotta pay him a cent.  Yeah.  I've been naked for years.  Eh.  What a dog she is.  Said Kane, who hosted a raunchy public access comedy program called the Sandy Kane Blue  Show.  And, of course, blue is B-L-E-W.  It did blow.  That's what the reviews were.  More than a decade.  You know how much money I make?  Two dollars a picture.  I'm not selling any products. 
[00:40:00]  She said she had once had a good relationship with the naked cowboy and had, in fact, asked  him to sing a duet with her.  Yeah, he raped me.  Eh.  Then we went out to dinner.  Eh.  She's terrible.  She's awful.  She just stole his gig and stands there.  Yes.  Yes.  Shameless.  Burke was willing to do it.  Both sides agree, but he wanted her to sign a franchise agreement.  Enough about the franchise agreement.  It's a franchise.  She could binder and binder after him, because he wears that little dumb cowboy hat. 
[00:40:30]  You have enough to worry about.  You have Sandy Kane to worry about.  We'll take care of everything.  She balked and recorded the song with a male counterpart she called the cowboy.  That prompted Burke to fire off the cease and desist letter, but Kane said that it was  no big deal and that she hasn't sold a single copy of the song.  I don't give a shit, man.  I don't care, man.  Yeah.  What you gonna do?  Sue me?  What is he, gay?  Yeah.  Hey.  Must be a faggot, man.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Jesus Christ.  She's out of her fucking mind.  I want this and a break if you got it.  Close.  Finally, the song ain't going anywhere, she says.  It's not like he's Tim McGraw or Keith Urban.  And then they have the tale of the tape.  Naked Cowboy versus Naked Cowgirl.  And has Sandy Kane called us back yet?  Not yet.  She's been begging to be on the show.  Finally, there's a reason for her to be on the show. 
[00:41:30]  She probably doesn't know about this yet.  She probably doesn't know.  So you got their names, whatever.  He lives in Secaucus.  She lives in Hell's Kitchen.  Big break for him, Playgirl.  Big break for Sandy Kane.  Times Square nudie shows.  That was her big break.  Back in the peep show days.  Great.  Claim to fame.  He sings in his skivvies.  Her claim to fame, lighting her boobs on fire.  Unfortunately, not enough.  No. 
[00:42:00]  Poor diesel fuel on him.  Light him up.  Yeah, like the fucking, what they're doing with the oil spill.  Payscale, the Naked Cowboy, $300 an hour.  Wow.  That's what he's reporting.  Yeah.  It's got to be higher than that.  And she gets $2 per photo.  And she's not taking a lot of photos every day.  No, I can't see a lot of people.  Plus, I've seen her out there.  People usually walk off without giving her the money.  Oh, really?  I've seen many people.  Really?  Hey, come on, man.  Hey, come back here.  I got to eat, man. 
[00:42:30]  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  TV appearances posed as male hooker on Jerry Springer.  That's the Naked Cowboy.  And how about him?  Yeah.  And public access program like Sandy Cain Blue Show.  Musical influences.  His?  Elvis Presley.  Hers?  Lady Gaga.  Oh, doesn't she have a dirty version?  I don't know.  Ew, does she?  Who the fucking knows?  I don't know.  How could her influence be a 26-year-old? 
[00:43:00]  Exactly.  She started performing before she was born.  Sandy was 50 when Gaga was born.  I'm Lady Eh Eh.  So, uh...  Lady Eh Eh Eh.  Lady Eh Eh.  Heard her dumb noises.  Well, get her in here.  What the fuck, Sandy?  Defend yourself.  I'll find her.  Why don't the tail of the tape have Twato on it?  Yeah.  Oh, no shit.  Yes. 
[00:43:30]  Yes.  Twato.  Claim to fame of giant genital wars.  They both have bulges in the front of their pants.  Yeah.  Pants.  She has to wear a second pair of underwear.  Yeah.  Cover Twato.  Push Twato down.  Cover that fucking ear growing out of her pussy.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Jimmy's gagging.  Dude, I'm eating a fucking oatmeal.  I can see Twato in 50 different places in my oatmeal.  Yeah.  Ew.  I hate when your food resembles something disgusting.  There's Twato.  Oh, it does look like...  A cauliflower ear. 
[00:44:00]  Look at some hair in your fucking...  Look at that cauliflower ear.  Come on.  Nice, right?  It does.  She's saying it's not a...  It's like the side of Jerry Cooney's head.  Even though we had a doctor tell her it was a genital wart, she refuses to believe that.  No.  She's sticking by her story that she cut herself shaving and somehow it turned into that.  Jesus.  She was shaving with a cock that had warts.  How long could you live with genital warts?  Does it turn into something else?  Does anyone know? 
[00:44:30]  I don't know, but I can't look at it anymore.  Calling Dr. Steve.  Yeah, the odd genital wart can be odd.  Let me tell you everything I know about genital warts.  The cure for it is pouring his wine on it.  Yes.  And it runs away.  It sprouts legs and runs.  No, it dissolves like the witch in the Wizard of Oz.  Yeah, I wonder if you put salt on it, will it dissolve like a slug?  Uh, we need Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Well, genital wart is caused by a viral infection that... 
[00:45:00]  He always talks like he's getting his cock sucked.  He sounds like the, well, what have we got here, guy.  Well.  Uh, we're waiting for him to pick up.  This is how I spilled the paint on my steps.  Fucking creep.  Uh, weird medicine, yes.  Great show, man.  It sure is.  It's great.  He knows how to do radio, and, um... 
[00:45:30]  It's so great that the company has, uh, decided not to pay him any money for the show, which  is just a terrific idea.  That's fantastic.  When you try to build a channel.  Uh.  Only getting his voicemail.  You've reached Dr. Steve.  All right.  He'll call us after the break.  He should pay him.  He's a bunch of grapes.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  See him fall down.  Oh, wait.  This might be Dr. Steve calling back.  Yeah.  Uh, let's see, uh... 
[00:46:00]  Hmm.  If, uh, he doesn't want to call, you know, I'm sure Michio Kaku would want to call.  Oh, shit.  Talk about, uh...  Is this Dr. Steve?  Jennifer Ward is like a river.  Dr. Steve?  Hello.  Hello.  Dr. Steve.  Hi, Steve.  Uh, we're talking about Sandy Kane and Twato.  Now, uh, have you ever seen Twato live?  I've never seen Twato live.  Wow.  How can I not get that figured out?  Next time you come to New York, my friend, we got a treat for you. 
[00:46:30]  Well, I actually pitched a bit a while back where I would remove Twato on the air, but  I think she turned it down.  Yeah, because it's part of her personality now.  But here's the deal.  We had a doctor way back in the day, back in the day, almost probably eight, maybe more  than eight years ago, uh, basically telling Sandy Kane that it's a genital wart that's  completely out of control, okay?  Yeah.  Uh, Sandy Kane said, no, man.  Uh, she said she cut herself shaving, because it's in the bush area, and, uh, cut herself, 
[00:47:00]  and then that cut turned into what we like to call Twato.  Okay.  Now, what are you thinking?  First of all, can you cut yourself in a way where something will grow that resembles a,  uh, a cauliflower ear?  You, uh, you can cut yourself and get what's called a hypertrophic scar.  It's also called a keloid.  Oh.  But it usually won't, I mean, I've seen pictures of Twato.  It won't look like that. 
[00:47:30]  It won't look like a cauliflower with a stalk on it.  Okay.  And, uh, but, you know, keloid, you've seen, surely you've seen that, where someone's  gotten a tattoo, or they've cut themselves, and they've grown this sort of big, giant scar.  Give me a keloid.  All right, boo.  That's pretty funny.  Let's give that keloid pie, Dan Court.  Keloid pie.  Just, we're compelled to do that. 
[00:48:00]  Of course.  Now, given that, uh, it's unlikely that it's a keloid, that it's most likely a genital wart.  They can, there are several kinds of genital warts.  You can get the little seed warts that, uh, uh, appear.  But some people will get big, fungating, cauliflower-like lesions on their genitals.  Oh.  And, uh, sometimes it will, you'll get so many of them that they will just sort of flow  out like, uh, uh, a waterfall caught in, uh, in, uh, in, uh, you know, uh, a photograph. 
[00:48:30]  Like a river.  A river of genital warts.  Right.  And they have to be removed surgically, and, uh, it can be a big deal.  So, now, uh, yeah, go ahead.  Uh, Dave, you, one of the things that you asked was how long can you live with it?  Uh, once you have it, you live with it for the rest of your life.  Very difficult to eradicate all the viruses that, uh, cause it. 
[00:49:00]  Now, uh, genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus, and that is the virus that is felt to cause  cervical cancer, so, uh, it is, uh, a sexually transmitted disease, and, uh, it's a sexually  transmitted cancer.  Hey, we don't have fucking cervix.  Who gives a shit?  Exactly.  We have iPhones.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm learning something for the first time today.  Sexually transmitted cancer?  Yeah, yeah.  First one we know about. 
[00:49:30]  What?  You could, you could, you could give someone else cancer?  Yeah, absolutely.  If you have a certain subtype of human papillomavirus, uh, it is the one that's felt to, uh, cause  cervical cancer.  So cervical cancer, not only a sexually transmitted disease, it is a preventable cancer.  Well, doesn't it, uh, really a sexually transmitted cancer, doesn't it give you a thing that will  then, it could turn into cancer, so it's not like you're, you're actually giving somebody 
[00:50:00]  sexually transmitted cancer.  That's exactly right.  It's right.  Yeah.  It's, it's not that you have cancer and you're transmitting it to somebody else.  You're transmitting the, uh, agent that causes the cancer.  Right.  I understand.  But it should be Bob Eatman.  There, there's, uh, isn't there a vaccine for that or something these days?  Yeah, absolutely.  There's a vaccine, it's called Garbacil, and, uh, they, uh, recommend that you give it  to, uh, girls before they become sexually active. 
[00:50:30]  I know.  I saw the commercials for them.  They're hot.  They just have these girls with their moms talking about how they're getting them this  fucking needle for when they start fucking.  It's just the hottest commercial.  Love it.  I like to apply it with my cock.  You can defile them later.  Yes.  I'm jerking off to a, ask your doctor commercial.  Wow.  Huggies or pampers.  So, all right. 
[00:51:00]  So she could die from the cancer part of this whole thing.  Well, it's likely that, uh, I mean, I'm assuming that she's getting her pap smears and her, uh,  uh, health maintenance exams on schedule every year.  Oh, yeah, I bet.  You're, you're not, you're not assuming correctly.  Her pap smears apply by the foot of an angry bum.  And that's assuming she still has a cervix.  I mean, she could have had a hysterectomy at some point.  Yeah.  Like, fell out on 9th Avenue back in 73. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, after a bout of whooping cough.  Fucking her, her, her female parts laying on fucking 9th and 33rd.  Some fucking Asian bike messenger ran over her innards, her life-producing parts.  Dr. Steve, I'm, I'm putting you on with Dr. Mike.  Now, uh, Dr. Mike was the original doctor that, uh, diagnosed Sandy Cain. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  Dr. Mike, you're on with Dr. Steve.  What's up?  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  Um, clear, clear condyloma cuminata.  Uh, no doubt this is HPV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't surprise me.  Listen to this.  Two men of similar ilk.  Hey, Dr. Mike, do you make shitty wine, too?  I'm teasing, Dr. Steve.  Yes, Mike, do you poison your friends one bottle at a time? 
[00:52:30]  No, boys, no, boys.  Well, let's have the two doctors talk for a second.  Go ahead.  Yeah, no doubt that this was a huge condyloma, uh, you know, definitely needed to be surgically  removed.  She should have follow-up.  I'm sure she hasn't.  Uh, not good for her in the long term.  Clearly implicated in malignancies.  Uh, we talked about that at length, you know, years ago when I was first in, but, uh, also  implicated in the transmission of oropharyngeal cancers from, uh, women that, uh, get it in 
[00:53:00]  a throat from oral sex.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know, anybody that gets oral sex from having, I mean, that gets oral cancer from  having oral sex with Sandy Cain deserves what they got.  Yeah.  Wow.  There you go.  Oh, God.  Didn't Paulo lick that shit?  Yep.  Yeah, Paulo had it.  One of Ron and Fez's guys.  In his mouth.  Paulo licked that shit.  Oh.  I would have recommended against that if anybody had.  I would have recommended against that. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, wow.  He's one of the nine out of ten doctors surveyed.  That's right.  I wouldn't recommend that.  Yes.  The other one was Mengele.  He's the one that said do it.  You know what?  Dr. Steve, when are you going to be in town next?  Uh, it looks like probably in October.  Well, uh.  I may come up sooner to do something on, uh, wrestling with, uh, Sam and Dave.  Mm.  Wrestling with Sam and Dave.  Well, you know, I used to, I was a cameraman and audio engineer for, uh, championship wrestling 
[00:54:00]  back in the day.  He's done everything.  Wow.  Okay.  He has done everything.  Because we want to do another, uh, uh, another, uh, what the hell is that for everybody?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Dr. Mike, you were involved with that one?  Yeah, I was in both of them.  Okay, yeah.  What the hell is that is one of our favorite bits of all time.  It got Jim Norton to stop smoking, uh, on the spot.  That's how crazy it got.  Do we still have Dr. Mike's, uh, information just in case we need to, uh, get in touch with  him for one of those, uh, one of those shows? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, we should do this soon.  I don't want to steal Dr. Mike's bit, but I'd love to do it with him.  Oh, of course.  No, no, no, no.  You guys seem to, um.  Get along?  Get along, yes, yes.  We need another hot doctor, too.  Like Dr. Steve?  No, we had a fucking, we had a fucking not.  Dr. Mike.  I was upstaged by, uh, the original one with some Playboy models.  Thank you.  One of those Survivor shows.  Thank you, yeah.  She was on Temptation Island or one of those shows, and she was hot. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  All right, Dr. Mike, we're going to put you on hold to get your info, but, uh, coming  soon, probably in the fall when Dr. Steve's up, we're going to do What the Hell Is That?  Or if you come up sooner, uh, Dr. Steve, you're going to have to do our show as well.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Of course.  We'll figure this out.  And basically, what the hell is that?  A lot of you guys, you don't like going to the doctors.  You got some weird thing happening.  You come in here, and, uh, the doctors take a look at you and tell you exactly what's  going on with you.  And we get some weird shit.  Oh, yeah.  Hence, weird medicine by, uh, Dr. Steve. 
[00:55:30]  Really strange stuff.  I remember one guy, one guy, he, uh, ate hot food, and he would only sweat on half his face.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just bizarre stuff.  Not, not the regular crap that we all have heard over the years.  What were some of the other ones, man?  It was a bunch of weird guys.  I'm trying to remember.  There was, uh, the kid who had only sweat on half his face had Horner's Syndrome.  Yeah.  There was a guy that got bit by a dog and was getting the bridge to transplant where he  had that face expander, uh, that huge piece of tissue off his nose. 
[00:56:00]  There was, uh.  Forgot about him.  A guy who had a, yeah, a huge cyst on his head that made Bob Kelly puke all over the  studio.  That might have been the original Bob Kelly puke.  Bob must have seen a picture of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, a third nipple.  Oh.  A bunch of weird things.  And then one, uh, one guy came in and, uh, I don't know which doctor tapped out.  Am I, was it you, Dr. Mike?  Did you tap out?  Yeah, it was me.  It was me.  With the cancer?  With the guy with the cancer? 
[00:56:30]  It turned out he was okay.  But for four and a half the noon or so, this guy was convinced he had, uh, cancer of the  mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah, correct.  He was a big, uh, tobacco chewing guy.  And he came in, he had this, uh, like erosive lesion in his, uh, gum.  And, uh, looked, you know, just at the look of it, he said, oh, Jesus.  I said, okay, boys.  I'm out of here.  Yeah.  Dr. Mike went from, this is a lot of fun, to, I don't want to deal with this next one.  I suggest he just goes to a doctor and, you know.  And the audio is really creepy to hear, because the guy's just like, just please, just tell 
[00:57:00]  me, tell me what I got.  Do we have the audio?  Tell me what I need to do.  He was panicking.  That was brutal.  We don't have it?  Yeah.  Because it's old?  You used to run it as a promo.  Yeah, I know.  A long time ago, Dr. Steve.  Well, I would love to do that, because it would keep me from having to stick my finger  up somebody's ass or drink their urine.  Why do you remind everybody that every time you come to New York, you have to stick your  finger up someone's ass?  That makes me think that you might want to do that one more time, Dr. Steve.  Unfortunately, it was my thing for a while. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, that was your bit.  Yeah.  What a bit to have.  You've got to have a bit.  All right.  Dr. Mike, stay on hold.  We're going to get your info for another version of What the Hell is That?  Could people start emailing somebody?  Let's get this going.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  All right.  We'll figure it all out.  Thanks, Dr. Mike.  Mike?  Oh, we're going to play What the Hell is That today at 1030.  Oh, cool.  Right on.  We have it?  Yeah, a condensed version. 
[00:58:00]  We'll play a condensed version of What the Hell is That, just so you guys know what the  bit's all about.  And we'll do a new one in the coming months.  Dr. Steve, thank you.  Did you have something else for him?  No, no, no.  I was thinking about it.  I remember that did, by take care of Steve, that did make me quit smoking.  It was that guy's reaction.  Yeah.  I'm like, that's how you react when you think you have mouth cancer.  Even though he didn't, but it didn't matter.  We all went home going, holy shit.  And then it turned out the guy was okay.  We found out a week or so later when he went to his regular doctor.  And so we all started smoking again. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Eating cigarettes.  Delicious.  Eating cigarettes.  All right.  So, uh, any luck with Sandy Cain?  I hear she hates us now.  We don't even know why.  Why?  Maybe because you've destroyed things of hers.  Every time I destroyed things, I gave her a fucking upgrade.  Maybe because you throw heavy things at her.  Why does she hate us, Steve?  The last time I talked to her, she was pissed off that you smashed her guitar that one time.  Really?  Her guitar cost $25, and I pulled out at least $200. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  And what are you defending her for?  She got a much better guitar because of the dumb bit.  But since then, I think we've had her back on, so I don't really know.  Yeah, so I don't really know why she keeps getting pissed off.  Maybe it's because you don't play her songs.  I don't really know.  She did We Are the World with us.  Huh?  Yeah.  She did We Are the World with us.  Oh, so then what the hell's the problem?  I don't know.  Let me say hi to Mike in Jersey real fast.  Mikey.  Mike.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Just want to let you guys know, this was right around the time you smashed your guitar. 
[00:59:30]  So this is from a while back.  Well, I came in to see the show on a Friday.  You guys gave us t-shirts.  Me and I was with Vinnie Brand's daughter.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  We're walking through Times Square, wearing the t-shirts, and we see her.  So Danielle goes over to take a picture.  We take a picture.  We don't give her $2.  And she's like, ah, come on, man.  She's flipping it on Times Square.  And then she goes, all you guys are the same fucking assholes.  You open it.  And they're all a bunch of assholes, too.  Fuck all you guys.  And we just walked off, and she was all pissy about you guys. 
[01:00:00]  That's all right.  She's older.  That was two years ago when you cut a guitar string, so you can't really hold it again.  How's Danielle doing?  She's doing good.  She's back from school now.  I haven't seen her much.  She's got a graduation party coming up soon, so I'll hang with her for that, yeah.  All right.  And hopefully at the Stress Factory for that, Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer, yeah.  Jim Brewer this weekend at the Stress Factory.  It's going to be a sellout.  Get your tickets immediately.  Yeah.  Fucking Brewer sells tickets.  Thank you, sir.  Last time we talked to her on the phone about the photograph of the serial killer, because 
[01:00:30]  supposedly she's one of the photographs.  She sat on hold for 45 minutes and talked to us.  She's not mad at us.  All right.  Then get her in here.  We're trying.  We're trying.  We'll play a Sandy Cain highlight as we go to break.  My favorite Sandy Cain moment.  We can't get hurt.  We're Edward Norton.  It's really getting bad around here.  My favorite Sandy Cain moment as we go to break.  Check this out.  I used to live in Nashville, Tennessee.  But I'm originally from New Jersey Jersey. 
[01:01:00]  And you know what?  I also lived in Miami.  Are you Jewish?  No.  I'm playing that.  Play it.  No, keep going, sir.  Okay.  Okay.  Uh, uh, uh, uh.  And I'm going to be on...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And it seems...  Opie has taken scissors...  And cut all of Sandy Cain's strings. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, that...  That's going to leave a mark.  Sandy, let me see.  Boy, that really, uh...  That improved the sound.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Sirius XM.  Got a busy show.  Jim Brewer will be here in about a half hour promoting his Stress Factory gig, 
[01:02:00]  which, uh, doesn't need our help.  732-545-HA-HA.  Or 732-545-4242.  For Jim Brewer tickets, they will sell out.  So, uh, call Vinny and get your tickets immediately.  Last night, um...  Andrew Lloyd Webber's daughter was there.  Yeah, yeah.  You see her?  Imogen, yeah.  Yeah.  She's pretty cute.  Yeah, I know her.  She does a red eye with her before a couple times.  She's nice.  Yeah.  I didn't know whose daughter she was, but, uh, she doesn't... 
[01:02:30]  She's a looker?  Yeah.  She's a cute British girl, but...  I think she's cute, yeah.  She's a British girl.  She's, uh, blonde.  You make a move?  Nah, there was no making a move on that.  What, are you kidding?  I think she's got money.  She might have a couple of bucks.  You never know.  Sometimes people don't, uh...  Andrew Lloyd Webber's put out a couple of, you know,  I guess a couple of, what, plays, maybe?  Yeah, name one.  Name one.  Uh, cats.  Did he do cats?  Oh.  I think he did.  Didn't he do that? 
[01:03:00]  I don't know.  Didn't he do all those, like, very popular, um, shows?  Yeah, he's...  Name one.  Um, Jesus Christ Superstar?  No, I don't know.  You're looking down there, though.  Nah, now I'm gonna look to see.  Look him up, Iraq.  I don't really like musicals, but if I know the name of a fucking guy,  then he's gotta be famous, because I don't like musicals.  Phantom of the Opera.  Phantom of the Opera?  Oh, really?  Who saw that?  Cats, Evita.  Really?  Holy shit. 
[01:03:30]  Is Cats still on Broadway?  It said now and forever at the Winter Garden Theater,  but, uh, I was, uh, passing by the Winter Garden last night,  and it's not there anymore.  And it's dark?  It hasn't been there.  No, Mamma Mia's there.  Mamma Mia.  Wow.  Mamma Mia.  He did Phantom of the Opera, Cats, Mamma Mia?  Jesus Christ Superstar.  Jesus Christ Superstar.  Who else?  Mm-hmm.  Love Never Dies.  Love Never Dies is never heard of.  So he's a one-hit wonder.  A little drop-off.  A one-hit wonder.  He's an eight-hit wonder.  He's a one-hit wonder.  A one-hit wonder.  Did he do Beatlemania, too? 
[01:04:00]  Back in the day, as they say, the day.  The day.  I don't know what day that was.  God damn.  Everybody uses back in the day.  Back in the day.  Do you notice that one?  I know we use it.  I know I use it personally, but wherever you go, you hear back in the day.  Back in the day.  That's a black.  That's one of those ones that start, like, in the ghetto, I think, that kind of just became,  I think, just became a common vernacular.  You think it started in the ghetto?  I think that's a black expression, back in the day.  Back in the day.  It's like an old rap expression.  Yeah, I think.  All right.  Hey, did you hear what happened on CNBC with Mark Haynes? 
[01:04:30]  He makes a sexist joke, and he won't apologize?  Oh, yeah?  This is great audio.  Has this been laying around, or is this brand new?  Yeah, we did this, I think, I don't want to say what show, Red Eye, that we covered it  on probably a couple weeks ago.  Have you covered it on Red Eye?  I believe we did.  It's the guy, it's about sports, right?  Yeah.  The perfect game.  Right.  We've had it for two weeks.  Oh, fuck.  The audio is two weeks old.  That's what I mean.  We've had this for two weeks.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Well, they're talking about the perfect game.  What the hell? 
[01:05:00]  I never heard it.  Yeah.  It's going to be new to some people out there.  And then Mark Haynes just kind of makes a little sexist joke, and the woman on set,  the newsreader, is just appalled.  She's shocked.  Oh, he's safe.  He is safe.  Outrageous.  Outrageous.  He is safe.  I don't know.  I kind of say who cares about the money.  The ump admitted to making a mistake.  He hugged the pitcher who wasn't mad.  And doesn't America need moments of graciousness like that a little bit more frequently? 
[01:05:30]  How about a moment where a guy celebrates a perfect game?  Hey, you know, mistakes happen, but everyone admitted it.  I thought it was handled so beautifully that it was a more memorable moment for its failure,  perhaps, and its success.  I don't know.  Maybe a little sentimental.  See, this is why women aren't in charge of sports.  Oh, my.  Good for him.  Yep.  You know what?  I think that this is a moment. 
[01:06:00]  Rita.  It should be passed over at this moment.  I got a laugh out of Brad.  Brad loved it.  Mark, it's time.  Because Brad thought that there might be a punch thrown on this set, and maybe we'd be in the UFC championships up here.  Let's get to the floor of the nicey with Matt Nesto.  Now, she's not the annoying part.  The annoying part is the fucking guy on the floor at the stock exchange who tries to throw this other guy under a bus.  She's not the problem. 
[01:06:30]  This broad is not.  She just made a hole.  Yeah, just a dumb joke.  Yeah, it was a dumb joke.  The guy was totally right to tell her what about a perfect game.  He wanted no part of her shit.  That moment was just great, and we need more moments like that.  Hey, how about celebrating a perfect game, he says.  Perfect.  And then we got part two to the clip.  Gordon Charlop?  Charlop?  Comes on the show.  Oh, this guy's a cunt.  Is he?  Oh, just listen to him.  You don't want to spit on him. 
[01:07:00]  But I noticed that you're trying to obfugate the...  Easy for you to say.  I can see.  The issue yesterday about not having women running major sports leagues, I find that to be quite objectionable.  Perhaps if that woman had been an umpire there, they might not have had the problem in the first place.  I think you owe Ms. Burnett an apology right here, right now.  That was a joke, Gordo.  All right.  That was...  That's right.  Fuck off, faggots. 
[01:07:30]  She even said that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a joke.  Give me a break.  Deal with it.  What a baby Gordo is.  How Gordo has rickets.  Perhaps if a woman was the ump, a tampon would have shot out of her pussy.  I like this Mark Haynes now.  I love him.  I think I know who he is.  He's the older guy.  He's just a guy.  He's been around a long time.  He ain't going to take any shit from some fucking hot looking news reader. 
[01:08:00]  Her stupid suggestion.  He was around when the women were just weather girls.  What's it like out tomorrow, Hull?  Yeah.  Tell me if I need a fucking sweater.  Leave the sports to me.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah.  I like him.  Yeah.  He's just a guy.  He is a guy.  He's been around since Walter Cronkite.  Yeah.  Now he's hanging out with the weather girl because she thinks she could offer a little  more in broadcasting.  But he couldn't believe she was saying that.  Like, he was like, what about a moment when a guy celebrates a perfect game?  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  He wanted to call her a cunt so badly.  Of course he did.  Hey, give her the old, here's what's happening.  Good for him for saying it was a joke.  No apology needed.  Yeah.  Move on.  Apologize.  Shut up.  Enough with the apologizing.  The fake apologies.  Right.  Right.  Well, we have a little more on Lloyd Webber.  Andrew Lloyd Webber.  John in Iowa.  Yeah.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Pretty good.  Hey, John.  Listen, you'd probably be blown away to know that Lloyd Webber's the wealthiest man in 
[01:09:00]  Britain.  He's actually worth more than McCartney based on those little musicals.  Wow.  More impressive than that.  Putting on those little shows.  More impressive than that.  He's not gay?  No.  I've never said that.  If he has this hot daughter.  Oh, wait a minute.  He has a daughter.  So he's had to have had sex unless he adopted.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  But wow, that's something.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  Worth 1.3 billion, people are saying.  Oh, my God.  1.3 billion dollars.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's not as nice.  It's not as stupid plays.  Huh?  Just from those stupid plays.  A million dollars.  Stupid plays.  We're waiting for intern Derek to come in.  When is he coming in here?  What's going on with him?  Can we do this without him?  I'm sure we could.  And then maybe get his thoughts on this after the fact.  And where's Sandy Kane?  Not picking up.  Not picking up. 
[01:10:00]  You know intern David?  David, sorry.  Intern Derek?  Who took the lie detector test.  Yeah.  You know, the racist kid?  Yeah.  He admitted he's a racist.  And the lie detector guy said, yep, you're telling the truth.  Well, the boys decided, you know what?  Why don't we continue with this bit?  So they took intern Derek, who has admitted to being a racist, and took him up to 125th Street to learn about black people.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's going pretty far. 
[01:10:30]  Well, I mean, a lot of us were offended by the things he said on the show and his Twitter and stuff.  And we wanted him to kind of learn about black people.  You didn't like his lack of tolerance.  Yeah.  Well, I thought it came from a very ignorant place.  And I've always said the cure for ignorance is knowledge.  Oh, yeah?  Is that what you've always said?  That's something I've always lived by.  None of us have ever heard you say that.  No.  Oh.  No.  I guess it hasn't come up in conversation. 
[01:11:00]  Why did you guys only go up to 125th Street?  Patrice O'Neill has taught us about this.  125 is bad.  Right.  But 148 is a lot worse.  Well, 148 is where there's no sunlight anymore.  We took a vote and decided to send him up with Troy, because Troy's the tallest person on staff.  Yeah.  That'll stop a robbery.  Yeah, sure.  Troy Kwan.  Yes, Troy Kwan went with him, and we all decided 125th was about the furthest we were willing to go. 
[01:11:30]  As far as you could go.  Yeah, even Patrice says he doesn't go.  To sort of keep everyone safe.  Much higher than that.  I mean, this kid, Derek, is an idiot.  So, I mean, he would have gotten robbed again, even while he was recording interviews, if  he had gone any further than 135.  Why do you say that?  He's a mark.  He's a mark.  We wrote him questions, and he insisted on improvising.  Oh, boy.  Even after, until he was scolded and told not to.  He didn't, in the end.  Right.  But we had to sit there and have him ask us these questions over and over and over 
[01:12:00]  again, because he kept trying to bounce off our answers, which is exactly what we did  not want him to do.  Was he going to get killed?  He would have gotten killed, yes.  He was very stupid.  And Troy Kwan was up there?  Troy Kwan went with him.  Why isn't he on mic right now?  He's answering phones, I guess.  He should be.  Fuck the phones!  I don't know what's taking him so long.  I don't know, yeah.  He's a fucking lollygagger.  Quit sloughing off in there.  Exactly.  So, uh, he was ad-libbing? 
[01:12:30]  At first he was, until Troy and I gave him the business.  Sent him straight.  Yeah.  Yeah, what do you got on this, Troy?  Yeah, so we decided to, uh, go up there.  I decided to go up there with him.  Um, we thought that sending him out by himself was probably a bad idea.  And, uh...  He wouldn't have come back if he had gotten up by himself.  Yeah, he would have gotten a little fucked up.  Even worse, if he somehow had managed to get back here, the audio he would have come  back with would have been garbage because he's so stupid.  Is he dumb? 
[01:13:00]  Very stupid.  He's just, I mean, his instincts are awful.  And, you know, he very well may have been robbed 40 times.  But I believe a lot of that was probably brought on by him not shutting the fuck up and running  his mouth like an asshole.  Really?  Yeah.  He's the worst kind of stupid because he thinks he's very smart.  He thinks he's funny.  He thinks he's cute.  Like the way he was talking back to the lie detector guy.  That's his vibe.  Like, that's the way he is.  He thinks he already knows it all when, in fact, he knows absolutely nothing. 
[01:13:30]  Wow.  You really don't like him.  He's very stupid.  And he has no filter.  No, he's got no, he's got no gauge of what's appropriate given the situation and where he's  at and none of it.  Well, someone just wrote, I hate that motherfucker.  I hope Derek dies.  I mean, that's kind of a bit harsh.  It's the vibe he gives off.  But that is like the first impression you get of him is, wow, I don't like this kid.  I hope he dies.  I hope he dies.  And did he call Ron and Fez yesterday?  That's the rumor.  I'm getting reports.  Uh-oh. 
[01:14:00]  I haven't received...  Spy report.  I'm getting a spy report.  Ron and Fez spy report is coming in.  Spy report.  I had his mom wake him up at quarter to six.  I had his mom wake him up at quarter to six this morning and demand that he came in.  But he still has not arrived in the building.  All right.  Well, we can start by playing the audio.  Intern Derek visits 125th Street to learn about black people.  Yes.  With Troy Kwan.  So what do you think of the job that President Obama is doing? 
[01:14:30]  I'll say have that fair.  But for the black people, pretty good.  Some other things like economy is not so good.  Economy is not so good.  How is the black community dealing with the loss of Gary Coleman?  How is the black community dealing with the loss of Gary Coleman? 
[01:15:00]  It's a loss to him because they enjoy him on television, you know.  He's a comedian and he makes people laugh, you know.  And they miss him.  They miss him.  Well, you...  Black people.  Who is that bum?  You went up to a bum.  The intern.  A nice gentleman walking around the streets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  They said they did some interviews right under the marquee at the Apollo. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  We really wanted to be in the heart of it, I felt.  Yeah, yeah.  You're in the safe part.  You're in the heart of it.  Well, the whole area is coming around, they say.  For Clinton's offices.  Yeah, Clinton's right down the street from the Apollo.  You'd never know.  Really?  I mean, it's...  Especially some of the questions that we were asking...  Were you near the Magic Johnson movie theater?  Where is that?  That's up there.  It's up that ways.  I've never been.  Some of the questions we were asking, you'll hear, you're playing with fire by going and  asking these people.  And if I wasn't there, he probably would have got his ass whooped. 
[01:16:00]  And he almost got his ass whooped by a couple girls, too.  A couple teenage girls.  Why would you...  That doesn't surprise me.  We heard about black chicks.  They're quite dangerous sometimes if you offend them.  Yes.  Yes.  Why aren't we talking about the obvious?  Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  I noticed that.  I didn't say anything.  Oh, okay.  Sean.  The stutter?  No.  The sirens.  The sounds.  It's just loud.  You can just hear sirens in the background.  And just buses going by. 
[01:16:30]  Lots of public transportation.  And the ambient sounds of Harlem, New York.  And this gentleman is not even phased.  No.  And right in front of the Apollo Theater, they're blasting Michael Jackson all of the time.  Oh, really?  I mean, they have Michael Jackson booths set up, and they're selling the t-shirts and  the pins and the...  It's been their thing since he died.  Yeah.  Is there a lot of white people?  Handful here and there.  But, yeah, it's an interesting part of town.  Do you feel uncomfortable? 
[01:17:00]  I don't.  No.  I mean...  Let me tell you.  I've never been up there.  Yeah?  You're not missing much.  I've never been up there.  You want to go?  You should go with Intern Derek.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And what can we do?  Ask some black people questions.  Talk to black people.  Yeah.  Maybe I could open my mind a little more.  Yeah.  Because I know I have my preconceptions and preconceived notions about African Americans,  and maybe that would open...  Shut up.  No.  No.  I'm right.  You had me going.  I'm right.  Nobody would bother you up there. 
[01:17:30]  Honestly, on 25th Street, I'm going to bother you.  Oh, believe me, no one would bother me.  You go there at night, it's a whole different vibe.  I don't even think at night you would really bother you.  I don't know, man.  People give you weird looks.  I went up there...  I went on a date, actually, up in Harlem.  Black girl?  Yeah.  Well, that's why.  Well, you're a handsome interloper.  Yeah.  Interloper.  They were looking at me like, what the fuck are you doing, you know?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, that's...  Sort of all women.  White boy.  Yeah.  I'm sure they didn't like that.  No, I know.  Especially the country music playing out of your car window. 
[01:18:00]  She's a pretty gal.  Some song about a house next door.  It was bought by everybody here.  Well, Derek asked the gentleman how he could get permission to use the N-word.  Wow.  Yeah.  What can I do to get permission to use the N-word?  Like, together with groups and gangs, these days, the younger people, these days, they say, 
[01:18:30]  my nigger, and what I say, you know, like that.  That's what I did.  I don't need that part.  It's a form of calling a person out of the name of a form of Ben and Leonard or different  because of racial color, racial, racial, what I say.  Have you ever cut someone with a box cutter or hit with a pipe?  I've been struck with both, mainly by black people.  You mean me?  With a pipe, yes. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  A guy, it was a guy, he was beating up a friend of mine, a woman, and I tried to stop  him.  He broke a glass bottle and tried to cut me with it.  I had a pipe, a piece of aluminum, it wasn't the old steel, aluminum pipe, and he was up  all over my face.  And I took the pipe and hit him a couple times on his hand when he was trying to grab me.  It bounced off and hit him in his teeth. 
[01:19:30]  All right, thank you.  That's, thank you for that.  Thank you for that.  Thank you for that.  Yeah.  That's how you know they were in a good part of town when there was actually a certain  percentage of the people when asked, have you ever cut someone with a box cutter?  They said, yes.  Yes.  Yes, I have.  Yes, I have, as a matter of fact.  You go to Midtown, let's say, and ask some people that are on their way, the hustle and  bustle, on their way to work, if they've ever cut people with a box cutter.  They have a different answer.  Yeah, I bet the answer would be no.  Or, that's a ridiculous question. 
[01:20:00]  Of course not.  Why are you asking me that?  But up there, no problem.  First guy asked.  Yeah, so you should be going to Washington Heights.  Well, again, we have to factor in the human aspect.  You do it every week, but you move up 10 blocks.  I'm sure Troy would be down.  Troy, how far up would you go?  Patrice says when he gets into the 140s, that's where it's really scary.  To where it just becomes like the set of Omega Man.  It's like, if I was going up there with one of you guys, it'd be a different story.  But I'm going up there, and not only am I having to get audio, but I also have to babysit. 
[01:20:30]  Because, again, Derek is so stupid.  He really is.  And he claimed he knew everything about everything.  Within 10 minutes of Troy being in Harlem, I left him.  I know, you know, he took the subway up.  And then 10 minutes later, I get a text from Troy that just says, I'm going to punch this fucking kid in the face.  Because he's just trying to be funny, and he's adding.  We told him before we left.  Was he funny? 
[01:21:00]  No.  Not at all.  No.  We told him before we left, he said, stick to the questions on the paper.  And he kept trying to add stuff to it.  Oh, my God.  There was some funny audio that we could have had, but he was trying to be ridiculous.  And then I scolded him.  I said, dude, shut the fuck up after you read what's on that paper.  Yeah, don't try to add to it.  Don't add lib.  So then somebody asked him a question in return, and he just goes.  And panics?  Panics, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Holy shit.  All right, let's continue.  Dirk approaches a more hostile gentleman.  Yeah, this one struck me as sort of, it could have been trouble if he hadn't gotten out of there quickly.  Now, we just wanted to get a survey on the meaning of some slang terms.  What does shorty mean?  It means a girl.  What does it mean to be wilding?  Acting stupid.  What does drop it low mean?  That's a new one for me.  Are there gay blacks?  Oh, yeah.  What can I do to get permission to use the N-word? 
[01:22:00]  Use it and find out.  Oh, shit.  What about with just the A and not the E-R ending?  Like I said, use it and find out.  As a white man, I have been robbed over 40 times, 99% of the time by black men.  You shouldn't have been in the area where you got robbed.  You shouldn't have been in the area where you got robbed.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's some logic for Dirk. 
[01:22:30]  How old was that guy who was talking to you?  He was an older gentleman.  He was the only 60s.  Oh, okay.  Was Dirk getting ready to use the word?  No.  I mean, if he would have, I would have hit him across the head.  It wasn't written on the paper.  No.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  If we use it and find out.  Do you think he would?  Yeah, absolutely.  That guy would have popped him in the fucking face.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, he's here?  Oh, Dirk.  Now, by the way, his voice is so womanly.  Yeah.  On that tape, especially. 
[01:23:00]  We sat with him for an hour before he left this studio, trying to teach him to just read  the paper.  We'd say, all right, ask us some questions.  And he'd go, all right, can I have permission to use the N-word?  And my response was, no, that's silly.  Why would, you can't use that word.  And every time, he'd be like, why not?  Oh.  Derek, it's not on the paper.  No.  Just read the paper.  He doesn't understand anything.  Because he thinks that he's got it. 
[01:23:30]  Like, he's going to go down there and just be like, just give me some guidelines, and  I'll kind of take it from there.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He really thinks he's cute and witty.  And that's what, when we got down there, I was just like, I had to scold him.  I'm not kidding.  I had to literally yell at him to just stick to what was there.  The fact that he's funny and witty and can come up with things and he's like endearing  to people and people like him.  Like, Troy had to, Troy picked the people he talked to.  I wrote all his questions. 
[01:24:00]  We were simply using him as a vehicle to ask the questions.  Didn't we have another asshole intern that I just described like exactly the same way?  Like, one that thought he was great and witty and people liked him, but they hated him?  God, who was that?  I don't know.  Wasn't it the one that went over to Rana Fez for a little while?  Who was that?  The one I called a fucking worthless piece of cunt?  Harry T?  Oh, Harry T.  I think it was Harry T.  He did think he was very funny and witty.  Yeah.  And he sucked. 
[01:24:30]  Who was Harry T?  Harry T.  He was the same intern class as me way back when.  Oh, it was a lying sack of cunt.  That was it.  And then he ended up being Rana Fez's first producer with Earl before he got removed and  replaced with Eastside David.  He used to post on the instant feedbacks like he was a listener, saying how great the production  pieces were that he would hand in.  That he did.  Right.  He would post for himself.  How'd they catch him?  Well, because he left the window open in the cubicle at work.  What a dump.  So, he couldn't even figure out how to do it without getting caught. 
[01:25:00]  You guys lied and said that you checked the IP.  Yeah.  But in reality, it just left the window open on the computer.  Yeah.  They'd just seen him.  And he admitted it?  Yeah.  Well, once you said, yeah, we checked the IP, you went, oh, yeah.  There was a doctor out on Long Island.  I just heard the story today that he had a dehumidifier or some kind of a fan unit, air  purifier in the bathroom in his office with a surveillance camera in it.  And he'd have gotten away with the whole thing, but he actually left the receipt for 
[01:25:30]  a surveillance camera and an air cleaner where one of his employees found it and checked  to the air cleaner because they knew.  It was like they'd been in the bathroom.  It was like, oh, here's a new air cleaner.  Yeah, we're going to put this air cleaner.  Oh, and surveillance camera.  And they just nailed the guy.  What a tool.  If he didn't have the stupid receipt, he probably would have.  Why would you save that?  What, are you going to write it off on your taxes?  Or at least buy the peeping Tom.  Yeah, what are you going to do? 
[01:26:00]  Have Uncle Sam or something give you money back?  Can you take Chip up to 125th Street?  I would love to.  I would love to.  And have him actually use the word?  Yeah.  Hope he can run fast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So where is he?  There's Derek.  All right, he's sitting over there.  Now, you kind of do have an ethnic look to you.  Yes.  Did that make it easier?  Yeah, we'll turn his mic on.  He doesn't kind of have that ethnic look to him. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Which he hates, by the way.  Yeah, and the problem was he insists that he's a white man.  Yeah.  And that's how he describes himself.  Mm-hmm.  Even though he's obviously brown-skinded.  Skinded.  How do you respond to the charges that you think you're charming but are in fact an ass?  We were just telling them that you were trying to be funny and ad-lib and all that stuff,  and you're not funny and you're rather stupid.  I don't think I'm rather stupid, but maybe I'm not charming or funny. 
[01:27:00]  I don't think I'm rather stupid.  I think I'm kind of charming.  Wow.  You're like Helium Boy.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  I'd love to hear him on Helium.  How close were you to using the N-word with that gentleman?  Which gentleman?  Well, I said, go ahead.  Try.  Yeah.  Find out.  When the guy said yeah.  I was pretty close to using it.  See, that's the problem.  You were supposed to just be reading the paper.  No, but I would never actually say the word, but in my mind I wanted to. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Why?  In my mind it's constantly, it's like a loop playing in my head.  You don't say it.  It's a loop.  It seemed like you wanted to say it and just got a big ham hand drilled into your face.  Yeah, why did you want to say it?  Because I usually say it, but like I said, I was never in a situation where I was in Harlem  where if I said it, I'd die.  Yeah.  Got to agree with you on that one.  All right, let's get back to the audio here.  Derek approaches some young ladies who talk about Obama and hood rats. 
[01:28:00]  Uh-oh.  Anything to add to this?  No, just that, you know, we wanted to get a full body of the Harlem population, so he  went to some women next.  What do you think of the job President Obama has been doing?  Oh, I haven't been really paying attention to politics.  Unfortunately, I'm a bad American, so I already don't know.  I'm just happy he's black that fall.  Oh.  Ant's worst nightmare right there.  You know, this is turning into an Ant segment.  Fuck Derek.  I just...  Fuck Derek. 
[01:28:30]  It's like, you know why?  Because you're getting honest answers now.  You're not getting some fucking media pundit.  You're getting...  This is...  This is...  Stupid Derek.  Stupid Derek.  I'm just glad he's black, though.  It's a very stupid answer.  Well, you know something?  It is.  But it's not...  It is stupid.  I wouldn't say it's racist, because it's just the opposite of what you would say.  Exactly.  I'm just sad that he's black.  Exactly.  Like, if she could say that, then yeah, my opinion is, meh, I'm kind of, you know, sad 
[01:29:00]  he's black as the president.  Well, that plays into it with you.  Yeah, of course it does.  Of course.  So it's not a stupid answer.  No, she just...  That's how people pick their fucking presidents and their honest.  She's being American Idol winners.  Yeah.  You know?  She's being honest, and I'm going, ugh.  And when I'm honest, people go, ugh.  Nobody had a good answer to that question.  No?  No.  What was the question?  How do you think President Obama's doing?  It's funny, because this one guy took this really long pause, and I thought he was going  to give me this excellent explanation, and he just goes, fairly good. 
[01:29:30]  Fairly good.  I was like, oh, that's it?  That's all you are?  You know why?  Because they voted in mass.  A lot of people went out and voted for Obama.  A lot of black people.  Without understanding anything besides the fact that he was black.  He didn't know what his platform was on anything.  And that's how he won.  But you can get Obama t-shirts almost on every corner up there.  Oh, with the halo on his head?  Yeah, and the pink pins. 
[01:30:00]  St. Obama fucking pins.  They look at him as a god up there.  Oh, they certainly do.  Well, they're kind of, I mean, black people think their lives are going to change immediately  when Obama got in.  They certainly did.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  I didn't.  Jesus.  All right, it continues with the black girls.  Now, we just wanted to get a survey on the meaning of some slang terms.  Can you explain to me what a hood rat is?  Can I show you what a hood rat is?  Radio show.  Oh, yes, yes, yes. 
[01:30:30]  A hood rat would be somebody that is behind in fashion.  They're, like, about two seasons behind.  They try to scrap everything together to make it look like something, but it really doesn't.  Like, okay, let's say you have, like, a pack of weave in your house, and you only have,  like, two tracks left.  They were used for two tracks, plus another two tracks from a new package.  You know what I mean?  I hate when that happens.  What does drop it low mean?  That girl sounds like me doing an impression of a gay guy. 
[01:31:00]  Now, a weave, she said a weave, and you have two tracks left.  Two tracks from another pack.  Left from another pack.  I have no idea what she's talking about.  She could be speaking a whole other fucking language.  What if it's the same product?  Who cares?  If there's two left in one pack, and then you got a new pack, but they're all the same shit.  You can't mix up your tracks, motherfucker.  Exactly.  That's what we're learning today.  Exactly.  Fuck.  Who knew?  Mix up your tracks.  She sounds like me when she talks.  She did.  She was, like, doing a chip kind of thing. 
[01:31:30]  Don't mix up your tracks.  Only she was 800 times funnier.  Trains will be hitting each other, you know?  Yeah.  So, uh...  I know.  What does drop it low mean?  Drop it low would be to drop down low while dancing.  Kind of, like, arch your back and pump your butt in, like, an in-and-out motion.  That would be drop it low.  The mating dance.  Ritual dance.  I don't know.  It is.  It's terrible.  The drop it low looks pretty damn good, Anthony.  No, it doesn't.  It looks like they're taking a fucking shit. 
[01:32:00]  You don't even like...  To reiterate what Opie said, they look pretty good.  You don't like the drop it low?  You haven't seen some of the drop it low videos?  Troy, you're a fan of the drop it low videos, right?  Because it's always a fat-ass mess doing the drop it low.  When it's done right.  I mean, it's done right.  It's possible to look...  It depends on who's doing the drop it low dance.  God damn.  And what does that mean, Derek?  It's got to be a white girl with a nice ass.  Then it's nice.  No, white girl's doing it looks stupid.  Eh, but it still looks a lot better than a black girl do it.  Black girl's doing it looks fucking stupid.  Black girl's doing it looks fucking stupid.  You like black girl's asses?  Not at all.  There's a chick who does a rap show as we go to the band. 
[01:32:30]  She's fucking got a nice little body on her.  In the morning?  Juicy rum.  Yeah, man.  What's her name?  Angela Yee.  Where is she broadcasting at?  Shape 45?  No, no, no.  This is down there.  Oh, the chick.  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.  Yeah.  I don't know her name.  I know what you're talking about.  But you instantly pointed to Shape 45, thinking that's where all the black people in the building  are.  There is a black girl broadcasting there.  That's okay to say.  All right.  Is this the best drop it low video on the internet?  I don't know.  Do you know where to find a good job?  That's right.  Huh?  I've never looked up a drop it low video.  She's doing a lot of other types of dancing. 
[01:33:00]  She's setting up the drop it low.  She's got a great ass.  I'm sorry.  Should I have to skip that?  No, we're good.  Get the...  There you go.  Every drop it low I've seen has been some fat ass.  Get drop it low most viewed.  Let's do most viewed drop it low.  And I bet it's a mess.  I bet you it's not a mess.  How many tracks do you use on your weave?  Sam?  I don't use a weave.  I'm natural.  You got some natural?  Yeah.  Yeah, you should have went up with them, Sam.  You look like you obviously live up there.  Yeah.  You fit.  Nobody would bother you up there. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, why did you go home after you set these guys up?  He was scared.  He wanted nothing to do with that.  Yeah, I said Troy.  Plus, Troy lives right by there.  Stop it.  Like you're being convenient to watch.  All right, we're not going to find the drop it low videos if you do.  Dirk asked the girls about using the N-word.  What can I do to get permission to use the N-word?  Uh, well, um, you can get permission within your immediate circle of black friends, but  once you step outside that black circle, you can't. 
[01:34:00]  You can't use it.  What about with just the A and not the ER ending?  I don't really have a preference for the ER and the A thing.  Me, it's just all the way around.  If I give my white, I don't give my white friends that leeway because then it can get  a little bit too overzealous and use it other places.  I like to be respectful to everybody.  But if you're white, if your black friends give you the, the okay to use it, just use  it amongst those few people and make sure nobody hears you.  That's ridiculous, by the way.  That is so fucking ridiculous that black people can hand out permission slips. 
[01:34:30]  They're called passes.  Passes.  Yeah.  To certain white people.  Then we can only use them under certain restricted circumstances and not with other people.  Fuck you.  I'll use it on my entire drive home.  With the windows up.  Yeah, well.  But yeah, I can't use it.  Because you don't have a pass.  No, because I don't have a black circle of friends.  No, because you're racist is the reason you can't use it.  Why do you want to use it so bad?  Yeah.  You don't have any circle of friends. 
[01:35:00]  You're a loner.  You're a loner.  Chris Rock had the best line of the word nigger.  He said that white people are so mad they can't use it.  He said it's one word that we can use and you can't.  Let's trade places.  You say nigger, I'll change interest rates.  That was a really funny line.  That is good.  We do have it easy.  Something like that.  It was a really brilliant line.  We do have it easy as white people.  Is she dropping it low?  There's a lot dropping it low.  There's something going on here.  Someone is suggesting, Andrew, is that I show Anthony's stanky leg. 
[01:35:30]  I think I showed you the stanky leg.  Stanky leg?  You don't know what stanky leg is on YouTube?  I know.  This one will...  Get the one with the kid.  Because that one will really get Anthony going.  Is this going to bother me?  Huh?  Is it going to bother me?  Yes.  Yes, it will.  Stanky leg.  Stanky leg?  I don't even like the name of that.  No.  You got to get the little kid on the table. 
[01:36:00]  In diapers doing the stanky leg?  Why do they call it stanky leg?  I don't know.  Do they do something that makes the leg look stanky?  He's a little kid on the table.  Somebody help me out with the leg.  Oh, stanky leg.  Have you guys ever heard of the dick swang?  The what?  Dick swang?  What's that?  Dick swang?  Yeah.  You got to see it.  There's a whole thing going on that is alien to me.  Oh, where is it?  We really don't gel well as two separate cultures. 
[01:36:30]  Well, I mean...  It's just there's such different things going on in the black and white communities that  we really cannot...  Our common ground is not as big as our uncommon ground.  That's all I see.  There you go.  There's the dick swang.  Dick swang, don't...  He's wearing boxers, so there's some room.  And then you see his dick fucking moving from side to side.  Oh, no wonder I couldn't find it.  It's called a dick slang, not swang. 
[01:37:00]  A dick slang.  What is this?  Is this a new sensation?  Someone's calling what I just said an ant-spiration.  Shut up.  Just go.  What the hell's going on?  It always happens when you're looking for something.  It never comes up on the intro tubes.  Another perfect game just got thrown, by the way.  Dick slang.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What?  Jesus.  One of the Oakland A's. 
[01:37:30]  What the hell?  It's the dick slang.  What are they doing?  They're just dancing.  Slanging their dicks.  Get your shirts on.  And then they're swinging their dicks.  Slanging.  Slanging.  Dick slang.  Through their paints.  And through their pants.  Like, they're wearing these loose pants.  Of course, they're pulled down and then fucking halfway down.  And then they shake their hips and their dick rubs on the front of their pants.  It slangs back and forth.  Even a white guy could dick slang.  Now, if a chick gets down low... 
[01:38:00]  And then you start dick slangin'.  And dick slangin'.  You're pretty much just fucking.  Right.  Correct.  At the club.  There's a dick slang.  What the fuck?  Holy shit.  Come on, now.  Come on.  Dirk continues talking to the black girls up on 125th Street.  As a white man, I have been robbed over 40 times.  Man, you were wondering when to use the N-word.  There was your opportunity, my friend. 
[01:38:30]  But in the end, you're a wimp.  Oh, that was fucking...  They're openly laughing at you.  That was a perfect opportunity to get him back.  Left, right, knee, thumbfish.  With the atom bomb.  Would you have done it?  Huh?  No, I wouldn't.  I wouldn't have done it either, because then, you know, not to be mean, but I would have  gotten killed.  He hasn't been robbed 40 times, so he wouldn't be in this situation.  Right.  You should have said, you're my circle of friends right now.  I'm asking you if I could have a pass.  And then when they say yes, then you just drop the N-bomb on him.  With the ER. 
[01:39:00]  With the ER.  Yeah, of course.  Because once you got a pass.  And then he ends up in the ER with a fucking massive concussion.  You want to use the word so bad, they just mocked you.  That was your chance.  Yep.  We're two different people.  I would have showed him.  I'll have to go back and find them and use it.  Yeah, you do that.  That'll happen.  He never answered why he wants to use that word.  Tough guy after the fact, huh?  He never answered why he wants to use the word so bad.  Why do you want to use the word so bad?  Because when you want to describe somebody and you want to really be negative about it,  you want to use nigger.  Pretty much. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's right.  That is a negative word.  It certainly is.  It can get...  As a white man, I have been robbed over 40 times.  Wait a minute.  Not only did he get a laugh, you got a...  A flavor, a flavor laugh.  Like, that shit is hilarious.  Yeah, that shit's hilarious.  It's not funny.  That shit is hilarious.  You've been robbed.  That's hilarious.  The more negativity you give out, the more negativity you take in. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, that's good.  How gymspirational that was.  That was very gymspirational.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Are you serious?  40 times?  By black people?  99% of the time by blacks.  No.  You sure they weren't like...  Why do you think that is?  Because you seem...  You seem a little...  Timid.  Yes.  Kind of timid and meek.  And like a really nice guy. 
[01:40:30]  And then you look like the type that might have money on you.  Like maybe you have a computer in your bag.  Or you just...  You kind of...  You look like you're not going to give a challenge.  You know what I'm saying?  Like you're not going to fight back if you get robbed.  Sorry.  And you don't have to use a weapon on you.  They look like you don't want any trouble.  Have you?  Are you sure they were black or they weren't dark-skinned Puerto Ricans?  How do you know?  I'm sorry that happened to you.  These chicks are nice.  I like them.  They're cool.  They're actually hitting on Troy. 
[01:41:00]  Were they hot or no?  Troy's a fucking chick magnet now.  Troy likes the black pussy.  They were nice though.  They were nice girls.  Are you sure to see that black girl?  We taught...  You know, dude, it's a hard thing, man.  Troy's got a stable.  Is that what your date was?  In Harlem?  Oh, okay, okay.  I forgot.  Yeah, we actually went to the bowling alley up there.  Why?  She wanted to go bowling.  In Harlem?  Yeah.  Well, she manned it on Friday.  It's something I'm thinking about, the bowling balls.  I know you are. 
[01:41:30]  So wait, she said let's go to a bowling alley, and you tried to pretend.  Instead of going, no, I'm not doing that, you had to pretend you're comfortable.  Like, yeah, this will be great.  Well, I thought we would go to...  You know, there's a bowling alley down in Union Square.  There's a nice one over on the west side.  And she's like, no, we're going to the one in Harlem.  I was like...  Where was it?  It was on 125th.  Okay.  And...  What was it called?  Bowl now, motherfucker.  I don't know, but they had a free Hennessy giveaway.  They were giving away free Hennessy.  Jesus.  Oh, that's good.  What the fuck?  And I was texting Sam, like, this is funny. 
[01:42:00]  This is ridiculous.  And what kind of food did she get?  She ordered chicken wings.  Chicken wings.  Chicken wings, free Hennessy.  How many bowling balls do you just hear dropping at the foul line because of the chicken wing  grease on everyone's fingers?  Boom!  Oh, gutter.  No, it was funny.  I mean, you're in a whole different world.  Is it a nice bowling alley?  Yeah, it was nice.  Sure.  But, you know, I was the only white person in there, and the brothers are looking at me  like...  Wow.  What the fuck's Whitey doing here with her?  No one bothered you?  Not at all.  Not at all.  No. 
[01:42:30]  But it's an interesting experience, you know?  You were the 11th pin.  Yeah.  Wing a ball at your fucking head.  Do you know what would be great to fucking do if he could just hold it without laughing?  Take dumpy fucking E-Rock and put him, like, in a white suit, all unshaven, with, like,  a white top hat pimp hat on, and put, like, fucking five smoking black chicks in miniskirts  with him, and have them follow him and worship him, and everybody would go, who the fuck 
[01:43:00]  is this dumpy asshole?  He wouldn't last five minutes.  That is good.  He is dumpy.  But who knows what they would do to him?  It's like, all these girls follow him.  Who is this guy?  He would get a lot of attention.  Absolutely.  He certainly would.  All right.  More of Dirk.  Dirk talks to a homeless guy up there.  Yeah.  This guy was good.  What do you think of the job President Obama has been doing?  President who?  Obama.  Don't know the guy.  Next question. 
[01:43:30]  How is the black community...  Is that true, you think?  All right.  He was being sarcastic.  He was just being an asshole.  Oh, really?  He just...  Well, he just kind of looked at us like, fuck you.  Who are these fucking assholes?  Give me my change.  Yeah.  How is the black community dealing with the loss of Gary Coleman?  Next question.  I'm not going to give you...  No, wait a minute.  Let me do this interview.  Now, we just wanted to get a survey of the meaning of some slang terms.  What is a hood rat?  That's me.  I'm in the hood, and I live with the rats. 
[01:44:00]  What does a shorty mean?  It could mean a lot of things.  Well, give me a few.  Okay.  It could be that little pretty girl over there.  Hey, shorty.  Come over here.  It's Tippi Uncle Tom.  Oh, it could be how short I am when I go to get a package of drugs.  They say, hey, come shorty.  He's never got the full amount.  Straight money.  He's always short.  So they call me shorty.  What is a dime?  That's a little more than a nickel.  What is a dime?  This guy's great. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  The hell is going on up there.  We found a new star for the show.  That guy rules.  He does rule.  The hell is going on up there.  Seems a little unpredictable, but he does.  We've got to go back and get more audio of this guy.  Derek.  What can I do to get permission to use the N-word?  Give me a bag of cocaine.  You can use the N-word all you want to.  Holy shit. 
[01:45:00]  That's great.  That is fucking great.  Give me a bag of cocaine.  Wow.  You can use it all you want to.  What can I do to get permission to use the N-word?  Give me a bag of cocaine.  You can use the N-word all you want to.  Anything.  Go ahead.  Go for it.  I'm out of here.  I'm going to get high.  You don't use the N-word.  As a white man, I have been robbed over 40 times, 99% of the time by blacks. 
[01:45:30]  Why do you think that is?  Because the black people have been robbed four times that fucking month, and all they  trying to do is get some of their fucking money back.  Me being a white man, why do you think our races don't get along?  We get along.  You don't want to get along.  That's the bottom line.  You got all the money, and you think this shit's funny.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Now he's getting serious.  Come on.  You got all the money? 
[01:46:00]  I'm surprised he didn't rob you right there.  Yeah.  He would have.  Yeah.  If you guys, if you weren't there, he would have, that guy would have fucking robbed  you, by the way.  Absolutely.  I think he just wanted money, but he probably would have robbed me.  He would have robbed you to get it.  Did you give him any?  I think we did.  Yeah.  What do you mean, we?  Well, you did.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Troy said that there was so much, he was yelling at Derek so much, and there was so much frustration  that the subway ride home was literally silent.  Oh, not even talking.  No.  Because he was fed up with him, and Derek just realized he had done poorly. 
[01:46:30]  Had just had enough.  Yeah.  That's some good audio, though.  Not bad at all.  Good job's right.  We got C from Newark.  C.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hi, C.  I'm actually driving through Newark.  I'm from Alpine, New Jersey.  But anyway, I wanted to know, like, I get the bit about you guys focusing on the inner  city and guys, you know, people who are, I don't know, seem like they're out of it  to make the bit funnier.  But I just want to know, why don't you guys ever focus on other black people?  Like I said, I'm from Alpine, New Jersey. 
[01:47:00]  Anybody know where that is?  It's a very wealthy area.  Yeah, Chris Rock lives there, Jay-Z, I think.  Exactly.  So I don't understand, like, why you only focus on one side of the black population.  Because the other side isn't funny.  They also wouldn't intimidate our intern.  Yeah.  To go to a wealthy neighborhood.  Yeah.  Yeah, part of the joke is, it's like, any group, if you're going in to talk to a bunch  of, you know, southern white people, you don't want to get somebody coming out of a doctor's  office with a stethoscope, because he's going to give you, like, a real gentleman's answer.  You've got to go for kind of funnier audio. 
[01:47:30]  Dude, have you heard how many truck drivers we talk to on a daily basis?  Yeah, I listen to you guys every day.  That's pretty much the other side of white people.  I hear you, but it seems like you can focus more on the black people than kind of, you  know, covering the whole bases.  You guys are funny.  See, what?  So, see.  That's a little racial for you to put it that way.  No, it's just funny.  Look at dick slang, motherfucker.  I mean, I don't think the guy on the phone is.  By the way, is this really C from Alpine, or is this Coop?  No, this isn't Coop.  This sounds like Coop. 
[01:48:00]  All right, that's my only point.  Jimmy, I love you, man.  You the man.  And you got a...  I do like the show, so...  All right, thank you, sir.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  C from New...  We're driving through Newark.  Yeah.  I mean, black people who are just, you know, normal working people are going to give you  regular, normal working answers.  Yeah, you don't want that.  You want the fucking...  There's some regular black people in there.  Yeah, but it's just...  They came across like regular black people.  But it's funnier to get guys that give you a wild...  Oh, of course.  Tippi Tom always gave more interesting answers than the average white guy would give.  Exactly.  He wasn't a good symbol of white culture. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  So, all right.  Good job, Derek.  Better job, Troy.  Goddamn great.  Sam, you...  Whatever, you fucking...  Look, I was important to the effort as well.  You weren't.  I was.  You left the scene.  Well, I didn't even show up at the scene to start with.  They wouldn't have bothered you up there.  No, I know.  I just...  I mean...  Oh, boy.  He doesn't want to be up there.  This ain't going to be good.  Little police brutality video.  Oh, yeah.  This is everywhere.  Oops.  Why did he hit the guy? 
[01:49:00]  Pulled his baton out.  I think the guy got in his face.  Okay.  He disrespected him, yo.  Well, we got to take a break.  Get in his face.  Jim Brewer outside the studio.  He joins the program next.  He's playing the Stress Factory.  New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Two shows Friday.  Two shows Saturday.  Seven, three, two, five, four, five, four, two, four, two.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Let me hear you scream like you want it.  Let me hear you scream like you mean it. 
[01:49:30]  Nice.  In stores today.  Ozzy's new album?  Scream out today, yeah.  Fucking sounds good, man.  I love this fucking album.  Man.  They're playing my interview with him next week on the Boneyard on my show.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  The one-on-one interview you did with Ozzy?  Yeah, it's an hour.  When are you on Boneyard?  Because I was listening to Boneyard, and then I heard, like, we've got a new voice.  And then I heard it was you.  Is it a regular show? 
[01:50:00]  It's once a week.  It's Tuesdays, 11 a.m.  They replay it Fridays, I think, at 9 p.m. and Sunday mornings.  Is it interviews?  Is it interviews or...?  No, it's mostly music.  This Ozzy thing I did was just special for...  Obviously.  But yeah.  We're not talking the whole time.  No, I talk and play music, but mostly great.  Isn't that great?  Yes, because now that I'm, you know...  I think we talked about this a little bit.  I love certain people.  But once I got satellite and I got to listen to talking for an hour on Boneyard, 
[01:50:30]  I almost crashed my fucking car.  Yeah, no, it's 98% music.  Yeah, when I was interviewing Dio, shut up.  Play the song!  Play the song.  Shut the fuck up!  No, he called me before...  No one cares.  Just play the fucking song.  Yeah, the music channel's really just got to play the music.  Oh, my God!  Unless you get Jim Norton, because he knows how to talk.  But you talk for a minute.  But he's also a comedian.  Right. 
[01:51:00]  That makes a difference.  It's a little entertaining.  You made a little different twist inside.  It's like a minute of talking and then just songs.  Yes!  That's all it is.  It's the way it's supposed to be.  Yeah, fuck around a bit.  1940s radio.  You don't like DJ banter on the music channels, Jim?  God, does that piss me off.  It's the worst.  It pisses me off.  This guy, I sat down with him in 1978.  And what's amazing is every time he comes to town, he calls me because I really have accomplished  nothing in my lifetime. 
[01:51:30]  But whenever REO Speedwagon comes, they call me.  Oh, Jim's a shit!  You know that Yes is touring without John Anderson?  I did learn that from fucking Carol Miller.  The fact that you brought up Yes is...  I'm already pissed off.  I understand that.  Does anyone listen to Yes anymore?  No, but Yes is one of those bands, it was all John Anderson's voice.  So how can you fucking tour as Yes without John Anderson?  Yeah, he had that distinctive high voice.  And of course, Carol Miller doesn't say that. 
[01:52:00]  No.  You should be saying that.  Not, oh, it's going to be a great concert.  It's going to be a great concert.  No, it's not going to be a great concert because John Anderson has a problem with his bandmates  and he's not going to be with Yes.  Can I ask something way more relevant?  I'm not a huge Yes fan.  Fucking Yes.  Yes.  You have a child.  Yes!  Congratulations.  Jim Brewer in studio.  Thank you, sir.  Do you check the kid every five hours to see if it's dead?  He was talking about that.  Well, seriously. 
[01:52:30]  Jim knows.  People talk about it.  Jim knows.  God damn.  The most amazing thing about when you have a baby is all I remember is every three, five  hours staring to make sure it's not dead.  See, those were definitely your pot years.  No, no, no, no.  We check every five to 15 minutes.  Yeah.  Well, yes.  Especially the first week when you bring them home from the hospital.  They don't.  I've said this a couple of times on the show.  I'll say it again because you can relate.  Obviously, they don't tell you about all the fucking noises a newborn makes.  And most of those noises sound like he's dying.  He snorts and makes animal noises. 
[01:53:00]  And then if you don't hear noises, you're like, okay, he's blue.  Great.  He's blue.  He's dying.  Yeah.  It's that crib death.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Crib death.  Crib death waits for you.  Leave your child in the bed with us.  We got video monitors, even though he's sleeping right next to us right now.  Do you have this bullshit?  What?  I'll go get him.  I'll go get him.  Do you have the sound where you can listen to them everywhere in your freaking apartment? 
[01:53:30]  No, I don't have that yet.  You're a man.  I like that.  I got video monitors.  You got video monitors.  But he doesn't leave our sight because we're too paranoid still six and a half weeks in.  You're constantly in the room with the baby, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't want to leave him alone, man.  It's like a wildebeest.  Yes.  It's like a wildebeest and you're right in the middle of the migration.  And you never know when the lions and the lion could be crib death.  Darting out.  It could be some retard coming over. 
[01:54:00]  He's like, hey, man.  Sorry.  Just getting over some mono.  Let me see the baby.  Dude, we were at a party this past weekend on Long Island.  Everybody wanted to grab the fucking baby.  I didn't mind family and a few friends.  I'm like, who the fuck are you and why are you holding my baby?  Drunk people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's getting rocks.  But Anthony doesn't fully understand.  The baby sleeps in a crib right next to the bed.  Yes.  On my wife's side because she's got the boob. 
[01:54:30]  And then I have...  What, her husband?  And then I have...  And then I got a video monitor that I look at on my side right there.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  You look at a video monitor of the baby on the other side of your bed?  Yeah.  Wow.  Instead of crawling over...  That is close.  But instead of crawling...  No!  Put your head up and look.  That's really...  Right.  Instead of just doing that.  Instead of crawling over the top of her, yeah.  I look to the side.  I got my video monitor.  I see the chest going up and down. 
[01:55:00]  I'm like, okay, I think I can squeeze in another 15 minutes of sleep.  Nice.  Oh, so you don't have to lift your head up and kind of wake up too much?  No.  Good for you, Hammer.  Take a little peek.  No, but...  Have you brought it out in public yet?  Mm-hmm.  Brought it out in public.  But that's a big deal.  Is that at the big debut?  It's a big deal.  Yes.  The whole fucking thing.  Again, it's a wildebeest and you're bringing it out and you don't know if the jackals are...  Yeah, the jackals are the lions are...  Are you afraid of cars and diseases?  The first time you bring them out is really creepy and scary. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, it's weird.  You're on high alert.  I can't explain it.  You see everything around you for the first time.  It's a new set of eyes.  Every fucking bump.  You actually see viruses in the air.  I don't know what's that.  Homeless guy.  Every sharp edge.  Every...  Everything.  You don't stand...  When you're at the walk, when you're going to cross the street, you're not cocky.  You're not on that curb anymore.  Nope.  Nope.  I have the right.  You got that carriage way against the store, against the wall.  Yes. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, I know.  How many hell are you kids?  11, 8, and 5.  Wow.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I'm going to get a tattoo.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, but they don't tell you about the noises.  And I told Anthony, during the day, it's easy when the kid's sleeping.  Let me tell you.  Easy.  But when it gets nighttime, it turns into a horror show.  You also...  Now I understand the whole concept of the way animals protect, because I...  Here, I'll give you an instance.  Wait till the first time you see... 
[01:56:30]  First of all, you got so many stages to go through, I can't wait to watch this.  There's the people...  I'm a newbie.  The ones that obviously just don't care.  Oh, that's nice.  And don't show pictures to anyone that's not a father.  And that includes Anthony and Jimmy.  They don't care.  Oh, I know they don't care.  They care a little bit.  No, they really don't.  They really don't.  And I don't mean that in a malicious...  I don't mean that in a malicious way.  Just, it's like a gorilla in the wild. 
[01:57:00]  I don't want to see you...  I don't want to see the kid.  I don't bring this pack over to my pack.  So that's number one.  Don't show your pictures to anyone that's not a father.  The other thing is, wait, wait to see how defensive you get.  I had a major situation.  My kid was like two.  And we had like a little bully up the street.  Kid was like three.  Every once in a while, shove it down.  And whatever. 
[01:57:30]  He went through friends around.  It was just constantly hitting her and all that shit.  And I knew something was up whenever my daughter would hang out with her because she, after  hanging out with her, she would have my cat by a stranglehold and have like this face  like, I'm going to kill you.  Holy shit.  I'm like, whoa, where did this come from?  I'm starting out.  I was like, oh, hey, I think it's from this kid she's hanging out with.  She's acting out.  She's acting out.  Well, eventually the kid's over the house and I hear muffling.  And now I'm not one to interrupt because I grew up, we all grew up in Long Island, Jersey, 
[01:58:00]  Jimmy.  And, and there's the rat pack.  You, you know, this kid's always going to get beat, but yet you're allowed to beat that.  You always protect each other and whatever.  That's just the pecking order of nature.  Well, I hear, and I look in the other room and the other kid was clearly looks like she's  three years old.  It has my kid in a death grip and a death grip and laying on top of her and she's pushing 
[01:58:30]  the kid's face into the ground and my kid's sprawling, you know, trying to get everything  she can with her hands and legs trying to get out.  My instant reaction, get the kid in the liver.  Well, I grabbed the kid.  That's a callback for everybody.  Yeah.  I grabbed the kid and I, right on the rear end.  And just as I hit her, not until the kid turned around, went, I want to go home.  I went, oh my God, I just spanked someone's kid. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  And that's a, that's a bad situation.  It was just a reaction though.  Yes, I couldn't, the violence that I instantly want to put upon this other kid for hurting  mine is definitely a life changing experience because you'll see your kid shoved.  You'll see your kid ignore.  You'll see other kids like, hey, hey, hey, you're fucking dope over there.  And you got to level it. 
[01:59:30]  But when this happened, spanked the kid.  And then I went, you know, obviously the kid's crying when I go home.  I'm like, no, no, no, it's, you know, that ice cream.  Yeah.  Now I got to think of something to make this kid forget I just did that.  Right.  Look, there's a bear outside.  It's a monkey.  Here's Barney.  Oh my God, Barney's here.  You're not allowed to spank your own kid.  And you're spanking basically a stranger's kid.  That's, that's dangerous.  Yeah.  It's really dangerous territory.  I instantly saw myself in court. 
[02:00:00]  I saw the headlines.  I just moved to a new town.  So my wife's like, you got to, you got to, you got to call the parents.  I'm like, I'm not, maybe, maybe she'll forget.  She's like, no, she's not going to forget.  Because this kid was clearly like, I want to see my dad.  I want to see my mom.  I'm going to rat you out, motherfucker.  Fucking kid just goes like this.  Hey, motherfucker.  I'm going to rat you out.  You're fucked.  You're going down, brewer.  You hit me.  Yeah, you hit me.  You know who my father, we know who you are. 
[02:00:30]  We know what you're worth.  You're that TV guy.  That's what I mean.  I'm going to take you down.  That headline.  SNL alum.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The old Pesci comes out.  They'll have like a picture of you from Saturday Night Live.  The angry.  Where you were angry.  And then another picture of a little innocent baby.  Yeah, right.  Fucking, oh, oh, no good.  There could be no good coming of that. 
[02:01:00]  Nothing whatsoever.  Now, what did you do?  How did you brainwash the kid?  This is, it's not working.  So, I'm trying to explain to her.  I'm like, you know, you heard her saying no.  No means no.  And blah, blah, blah.  So, the kid's obviously now realizing, right, I'm stuck here.  But for like two, three minutes until he feels good.  She, this is how smart the kid was.  She was in a situation where she knew I wasn't going to let her go to instantly snitch on me. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  So, she was smart enough to go, yeah, no, everything's cool.  As a three, the way a three-year-old would talk.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no, and after like three minutes, she's like, you know, I'm kind of hungry.  I'm going to go home now.  So, she's working the back angle.  Right.  But I know she's working on my kind of physics.  Yeah, yeah.  I am happy that you didn't allow that three-year-old to outsmart you.  You can't fuck with Buller when you're three.  Well, this, this, you couldn't have written this any better. 
[02:02:00]  I finally go, all right, I got to call her.  I just got to fess up and I got to tell her what's going on.  So, I call the mother.  Mother picks up the phone.  My heart's going a thousand miles an hour.  She's like, hey, what's, how's everything going?  I said, listen, things aren't, I, listen, I apologize.  But the kids were scrapping a little.  And she goes, did you hit my kid? 
[02:02:30]  Oh, shit.  Out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere and I went, she goes, listen, everyone hits my kid.  I tell everyone you have free range to hit my kid.  The kid's wild.  She spanked at every house.  What did she do?  I'm sure she did something wrong.  I'm like, wow.  Well, it wasn't her fault.  But, no, I spanked them both.  Yeah, both of them.  Yeah, the both of them got a little shove.  I hit one kid with the other kid. 
[02:03:00]  He was a child.  Like at the end of The Wanderers when he's swinging the ducky boys.  And all is good.  They got lollipops and all good.  She goes, listen, my kid is, she's an animal.  Don't worry about it.  Whenever you need to spank him, spank him.  Wow.  Can you ask for a better ending than that?  When you hang up the phone and then turn your head, look at the three-year-old and go, just got off the phone.  With mom.  I'm fine.  And you know what?  I'm not done now.  Yeah, yeah, now I'm not done. 
[02:03:30]  Because I think you need to be shoved.  Tied up.  You little fag.  Little fag.  I was talking to Louis C.K. yesterday.  The one thing I'm scared is when he starts making friends.  And then you've got to hang out with asshole parents.  Do you have that?  You know what?  Like people you would never hang out with.  But now the kids get along.  So now you're hanging out with that kid's father or mother.  You don't hang out.  I have a couple parents that I just don't trust. 
[02:04:00]  And you're going to have a tougher time, too.  Like we'll go to a bounce around thing.  And it's the big birthday thing.  And then the one parent goes over their top to be friends with one of your other kids.  I have this parent.  And he's going to my oldest daughter, which I instantly am fed as a rush.  She's 11, starting to grow the boobs.  She's got a black rear end.  She's got gymnastics, so I know I'm in trouble.  Jesus, you're fucked.  Yeah, she's got a black rear end. 
[02:04:30]  Boops are coming in at 11 now?  Yes.  Jesus.  Yes.  What the fuck is that about?  She's like, Dad, I got hair in my arms.  Oh, God.  What is that?  So this kid is going, hey, who's your BFF?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Kid or parent, we're saying?  A parent.  I said, what was that?  What does that mean?  What's a BFF?  What is a BFF?  Because we're friends forever.  Well, why would you ask my daughter who's your BFF? 
[02:05:00]  I've never even met you.  Why?  Who are you?  She's like, oh, I'm Troy's father.  He's trying really hard to be super cool, but I don't know if it's super cool.  You never do that in front of the parent.  Right.  It's almost like going up to a cop like, hi, you want a cup of coffee?  When you're not around, I'm going to do something dark to your daughter.  Something dark.  I got a pillow lined up and my car's blocked off the street. 
[02:05:30]  It's like trying to hide in plain sight almost.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Coming up to the old cop like, here, I love what you guys do.  It's phenomenal.  That's why I would do it.  So, yeah, you just don't, you cold.  Why did the guy ask that?  He didn't finish the story.  I don't know.  Because he's a red dot on a map when you put a certain app on your phone.  You think he's a red dot guy?  You think he's a red dot on the fucking.  No.  Or does he want his kid to get along with your kid so he has a relationship with you?  So he can hang out with the brew man, yes.  That's what I think.  That's what I think. 
[02:06:00]  Do you think he's being a little nicer to her because she's your daughter?  Of course.  I don't think he can do anything to my daughter.  I hope.  Jesus.  But, yeah, you're going to deal with a lot of that nonsense.  Kids just want to hang out so they can hook up with you.  You should.  Thank God we do.  You know what you should do?  What?  What?  As time goes on, you start becoming friends with parents that you should have come up here  and let Jimmy and Anthony judge if these parents are good enough to hang out.  If they're really true, are they here just to hang out or are they here to hang out with 
[02:06:30]  the hoopla?  You know?  You watch their face and you can see.  Give them a little test.  Some questions.  They look around.  They're all full of wonder.  Yeah.  Wow, look at the studio.  Wow.  You are in a magazine?  Look at your pitches up there.  If the wife has gray tits, she's listening.  That's another thing.  Their criteria will be different.  You can walk up to the guy's wife.  Well, who's your BFF?  And you've got three girls, right, Brewer?  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, fuck that.  Nah, I'm going to start dressing like a transvestite.  I'm so glad I didn't have a girl first.  So fucking glad.  You're lucky.  I don't know how you deal with the girls.  Boys are easier, too.  That's what everyone says.  Because the wife fights with the daughter.  It's a good time at home.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's great.  Yeah, well, they've got that female butting heads thing going on, right?  Nonstop.  But men do it, too.  Men buttheads.  That's how some boys become gay.  Yeah.  No too much butting heads. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Fine.  I'm not going to be like you, Dad.  Take that.  Oh, my God.  You ever think of that one, O?  You got any contingency plan?  Oh, my God.  You start seeing some effeminate behavior.  Or my kid?  Behavior, yeah.  What do you do?  That's just a wonderful question.  No, I'm just saying.  Have you ever...  That's a fair question.  Yeah, you got to think of, like...  Hey, dude.  Like, is there anything you would, like, any effeminate, like, qualities...  I'll beat the shit out of him until he's straight.  That's a fair question.  Is that what you want to hear?  No. 
[02:08:00]  I'll deal with it when it happens, if it happens, and hopefully it doesn't.  But if it does, what are you going to do?  That's a fair question.  My little one, although she's five, she refuses anything female-y.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  So you're starting to think, maybe.  I'm not...  You know, when she's eight, and she starts really wanting to play softball.  Right.  Girls can be tomboys, though, and grow up to be just fucking regular cool girls.  Exactly.  But boys, the second they show feminine qualities, they're gay. 
[02:08:30]  You know what's going on.  They're gay.  It's like, oh, look.  You know, if a girl wants to, you know, put on a baseball cap and go out and knock around  a baseball or something, it's fine.  If the boy wants to wear mommy's shoes and put a bra on his head or something...  He'll be strangling prostitutes in 25 years.  Get him in a karate class.  At least get that done.  Yeah.  Make sure the kid can fight.  Oh, shit.  Because he's going to have a lot of fights on his hands.  Do you know I got hit when I was a kid by some parents? 
[02:09:00]  I forgot about this.  Really?  I got slapped in the face, I think it was.  It was something...  Grandpa Brewer?  Yeah.  It's just something that happens in this family.  My mother fucking grabbed me and walked me over.  I have very vague memories of it, but I remember her screaming at that woman to come out of  her apartment.  Wow.  My mother made a fucking scene.  How old are you?  17.  And the woman was 18, and she had hit my penis with her mouth, and mommy got jealous.  No, I don't remember exactly what it was.  I just picked up your mother like, there's a whore living in your apartment! 
[02:09:30]  Open the door!  Janice Rossi's a whore!  I think I was about six or seven.  I was really young.  I was six, maybe.  What did you do?  Don't remember.  Being wild, I was a wild kid.  I have vague memories of my mother screaming.  Back then, everyone got hit, so it's more normal than that.  Don't you hit my son.  You can't hit anything now.  You can't hit anything.  Especially in public.  No, no, no.  You got to take your kid around the corner.  You shake him.  A little kidney punch.  You punk.  I call my oldest one punk once in a while. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah?  You're a fucking punk.  Don't be a punk.  Sorry.  Sorry or shut up.  Yeah, sorry.  No, you're not allowed to say shut up.  That piss.  No, shut up.  You can't say shut up to your own kid?  No, no, no.  They can't say shut up.  Oh, to you.  Right, right, right.  To anyone.  Really?  Yeah, not to each other.  Dude, it's aggravating.  And when you got kids and one kid's going, shut up, you stupid.  You want to strangle them.  So none of that goes on in the house. 
[02:10:30]  I'm like, I don't want to hear.  If I hear it, you're all done.  Yeah, my parents tried pulling some shit like that once with, like, oh, I hate.  Because I'd be like, oh, I hate this kid in school.  It's like, no, you dislike.  You could dislike someone, but not hate.  And then I think I'd just turn around one day and say, I hate when you tell me I dislike  something.  Your parents said, you could dislike that kid and hate blacks.  Sorry to jump on you.  But that is exactly what happened. 
[02:11:00]  I know.  Let me show you the difference between disliking and hating.  That son of a bitch across the street, I don't like him.  See that thing walking down the street?  The pants down to the rear end?  Hate them.  Speaking of that, you know, I'm very open-minded.  But have you guys, you've been to Wildwood?  I have been, actually, yes.  Last year.  Many years ago.  Last August, yeah.  Wildwood, meaning New Jersey. 
[02:11:30]  New Jersey Shore.  The only way to blend in there is to tattoo, I hate whitey all over you.  Yeah.  And, uh, oh, dude, let me tell you something.  I went to, my daughter.  North Wildwood with the boardwalk?  Yeah.  My daughter has a gymnastics convention, right?  So we're trying to get hotels that are all sold out.  And everyone tells you, eh, well, the hotels there aren't so nice anyway.  All right, no problem.  Go down there.  I find a condo, which is half a block from the boardwalk, three blocks from the convention center. 
[02:12:00]  Nice.  And this is going to be...  Perfect.  Nice.  We show up.  There's a lot of, uh, different groups.  Walk it.  We got there about midnight on a Friday night.  Very diverse crowd.  Thank you, Anthony.  Wait, what weekend was it, by the way?  Uh, Memorial Day.  Oh.  Not in Wildwood.  No.  And that's what everyone says.  No. 
[02:12:30]  But why is that?  Gang weekend in Wildwood.  Oh, shit.  That's where the gangs go there.  Are you kidding me?  No.  That's been talked about for years.  It's known as gang weekend?  Gang weekend?  You went to gang weekend?  Gang weekend, dude.  Check that out.  With your young family.  Oh, my God.  Now I realize how much danger I was and how stupid I was all weekend.  Oh, my.  All right.  So check this out.  Is it really known as gang weekend?  I believe it is, yeah.  I think...  Well, I've been down there.  That's why I was surprised by what you're saying.  It ends with cops.  There's some diversity, but...  It ends with cops and them explaining this to me. 
[02:13:00]  However, that's interesting you say that, because I thought the cop was just doing a cop-out.  Friday night, we get there, diversity crowd, blah, blah, blah.  Beautiful condo.  We get in a condo.  I'm always sweating out, because anywhere I got to go, the wife has to walk in, look  around, and go, oh, yes, we're staying.  Or, no, we're not.  Find a new place now.  She has to approve of it.  She's done that before?  Oh, of course.  Yes.  Absolutely.  There's nothing more fun than being delayed on a plane, taking forever.  Kids are having to break down. 
[02:13:30]  You walk into a beautiful sweetening.  I smell smoke.  Someone in here has smoked before.  Or there's stains.  Or, like, we're leaving.  It's a five-star suite.  Are you kidding me?  Where are we going?  I want to be put up.  All right.  All right.  All right.  So, with that, thank God, instant relief, I get in the condo, we're okay.  Now, I don't have a problem with diversity.  None whatsoever.  However, the next day, I notice the group directly across the street from me. 
[02:14:00]  There's about 30 of them.  And they're having a great time.  They're singing gospel.  Not gospel.  They're singing, you know, they're just singing.  R&B or something.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah, okay.  A lot of R&B, a lot of this, a lot of Latino music.  It's all good.  However, around four o'clock, I hear screaming, yelling, look out in the street. 
[02:14:30]  There's about 30 of them in the street, right outside my condo.  Yo, fuck, I'll kill you, motherfucker, I'll fuck it.  I'll kill you.  Yo, I want a piece of this.  You'll man up, man up.  I'm like, man up.  Okay, all right, you know, cops come, cockroaches back in the buildings.  Don't get too much.  We survived the first night very loud. 
[02:15:00]  I can't stand white people.  Hate them.  Let's round them up and kill them.  Hate white people, especially ones that just got here.  All is good.  All is good.  I go on the boardwalk.  I notice, all right, it's a little, I'm a little too upper middle classed out.  So let me scale down a little back to my roots.  I'll put on my T's, my ACDC shirt, little shorts. 
[02:15:30]  I got no problem with this.  No problem with the diversity.  I got no tattoos.  I have no tattoos.  I stick out big time.  Yeah.  Big time.  No tattoos.  You stick out.  All right.  I'm walking around.  Sunday night.  We're leaving Monday.  Sunday night.  About seven o'clock.  Yeah.  Class breaking.  Fuck you, your mother.  Look out.  Full-blown brawl.  Oh, shit.  In the middle of the street. 
[02:16:00]  There's three piles of people getting kicked, punched.  I'm trying to get the kids like, what's going on?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Don't look at this.  Look, who wants to play Candyland?  Have some Coke and Pepsi.  Killing each other.  Call the cops.  There's a brawl outside.  I see knives.  Cops come.  They put, whee!  As soon as they hear the sirens, of course, the cockroaches go back in their building.  Which is why they put on the sirens before they get there.  Absolutely. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, so they don't have to deal with that shit.  Absolutely.  Now it's about nine o'clock, ten o'clock.  Kids go to bed.  Car pulls up outside.  Now that I think about it, I'm really stupid for doing this.  But my wife, hilarious, she's like, ooh, someone's having a barbecue.  I went, hon, that's not barbecue.  That's pot.  And a pot is just streaming in our condo. 
[02:17:00]  And I look out, and they're all outside.  You know, with the big cigar.  I hate white people.  Car pulls up.  Blasting.  Shaking horse.  Like a dope.  I don't even think.  You know, they're turning that down.  So I go.  Oh, no.  What's wrong with you?  This is how people die.  I go outside.  I go walking up. 
[02:17:30]  And they're all right in the middle of smoking a pot and all that.  And I said, listen.  Listen.  Oh.  Listen.  The cut.  Listen.  My kids are right there.  The one guy's looking at me goes, I'm parking.  I said, I understand you're parking.  But you don't need the music that loud.  I got kids.  I just.  You go down the street and play that.  I got no problem with that if you go down the street and play it.  The one Latino kid. 
[02:18:00]  He's had no shirt on since we got there.  And he's the main culprit for starting all the fights.  He goes, no, no.  I feel him.  I feel him.  It's all right.  It's all right.  I feel him.  He reaches in, turns it down.  I said, all right.  We got a connection.  We're okay.  He feels me.  I'm cool.  I wasn't a dick.  I just came out.  Like, listen, man.  He turned it down.  I go back up.  Three minutes later.  Ping.  Ping.  Look out.  Full-blown street brawl.  Again. 
[02:18:30]  The kid with no shirt has a guy in the street and he's smashing his hair on the ground.  He was feeling him, too.  The other guy's kicking his legs.  And then as I look up, the chicks are now fighting.  All these Latino chicks pulling hair, screaming, fighting.  There's a whole group of black kids coming out.  And it's, I'm like, this is the sickest thing I've ever seen in my life.  This is stuff you see on, like, police videos.  And you go, this would never happen in the northeast of America.  This is obviously it. 
[02:19:00]  Again, I call the cops.  I'm like, guys, the fights, they're killing each other.  Meanwhile, this must go on because every white person in the neighborhood, and there's only like six of us,  they all hang out on their patios in the pitch dark, just watching.  Yeah.  Like behind towel, you know, they put the towels over the railings, and it just.  They're peeking through.  Yeah.  And they're all just watching, you know.  And again, cops.  Turn on.  Scatter like cockroaches. 
[02:19:30]  Midnight, same thing.  Fight, killing each other, blah, blah, blah.  Holy shit.  They're beating each other against my condo, and I hear like, I call the cops.  I said, don't turn on the sirens.  They're trying to break in the condo.  That gets them to come.  They come.  This is how stupid the cops are, or how much they don't care in Wildwood.  Cops come, and they pull up to the house.  I give them the address and everything.  This is where they are.  They keep going up there three times, and the animal with no shirt is in there. 
[02:20:00]  Cop gets out.  They all come out, and they start talking to the cops.  You know, we're watching.  Like, oh, they're going to get it now.  Those little gangbangers are going to get it.  They start pointing down the street.  All the cops get in their cars, and they head up the street.  Oh, they told them, yeah.  They totally diverted them.  They went that away.  You can't even make that up.  So they all take off except for one.  The one guy's parked below me, and my wife's like, don't say no. 
[02:20:30]  I said, no, I'm going to tell these guys.  My brothers are cops.  I'm going to tell them.  They're all in that house.  I go, hey.  Hey.  He looks up at me.  I said, listen, they're all in there right now.  He goes, no, it's another house up the street.  I said, no.  I've been here for two nights.  It's that house.  They get in fights.  They wait for people to walk by.  They start the fights with them.  And the main guy is looking at me right now.  He's got no shirt on.  He's up on the top, and he's right there. 
[02:21:00]  The guy saw you pointing at him?  Oh, yeah.  He goes, are they black or white?  I said, everything.  Black, white, Latino, mostly Latino.  He goes, okay.  He gets in his car, and he leaves.  I swear to God.  All right.  You know what?  Let me just get out of this place.  Let me get out of this place.  We're done.  It's Monday morning.  It's Memorial Day.  So we're leaving.  Life is good.  No worries.  I'm packing up the house. 
[02:21:30]  They're all outside.  They're hanging out.  No big deal.  I have my car in the front.  I packed it.  I have my in-laws who, to give you a little bit of my in-laws, I mean, they are as white  as you can be.  And they've never seen any type of crime whatsoever except for on cops.  Matter of fact, there's a joke in our house called, where's the gun, Jin?  Because they live almost near Pennsylvania.  And one night, someone was banging on their door at three in the morning. 
[02:22:00]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  And my father-in-law is going, hey, you know, who is it?  And they couldn't understand.  We're calling the cops.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Open the door.  And he said, get the gun, Jin.  And knowing he has no gun, but as a last resort.  And my mother-in-law goes, what gun, Herb?  We don't have guns. 
[02:22:30]  So there's a whole lot.  Oh, she blew it.  Yeah.  So in the family, there's a running joke of, go get the gun, Jin, whatever you space it up.  Yeah, who was at the door?  Who was at the door in the end?  They were movers.  Okay.  And the cops came 40 minutes later.  They were movers.  They were told, this is the address.  Oh, for a wrong house.  And the people are really old, and they won't hear them, and they're incoherent, and all that.  And it was like two houses wrong.  So anyway. 
[02:23:00]  What gun?  We don't have a gun.  We don't have a gun.  What gun?  So the same in-laws are with you down in Wildwood.  They're with me.  Right.  Backing up the car.  Now, my condo, you got to enter it from the second floor.  So the first floor has a door.  You go into a garage area, and you walk up a spiral staircase, and then you're on your patio, and you're walking your front door.  So technically, you feel safe, because you're up.  Your front door is up a level.  You got the high ground.  Yeah.  Yes.  But you do have to walk up. 
[02:23:30]  Anyone can walk up the stairs, technically.  Well, with that, I got everyone in the car, except for my one daughter.  The oldest one's got her iPod, like, I'm leaving the world.  I'm sitting on the sixth floor.  Two daddies ready.  Two daddies says we're leaving.  I'm not getting in the car.  All right.  Now, the mother-in-law comes up to me and goes, can you believe this man is giving these girls drugs right in front of us?  And she's saying it way too loud.  Oh, no.  I said, I don't know what you're talking about. 
[02:24:00]  She's like, look, right in front of our door.  So I turn around, the worst of worst, not to be biased, but any time I see an albino, it's almost like a pit bull.  You never know, is it human, is it not human, is it black, is it white?  It's an albino.  It's an albino.  That's all I have to say.  It's an albino.  And the albino is hanging out with these three little Latino girls.  And he's, you know, whatever.  He still cares what he's doing. 
[02:24:30]  He don't care if he's doing, I don't care either.  So with that, she goes, he's dealing drugs.  I said, Ginny, just get in the car.  We're leaving in three seconds.  All I got to do is take this key, go up to the condo, put it in the box, shut the door.  We're in the car.  We're done with Wildwood.  They're blocking the pathway to the door.  Oh, shit.  So I just said, excuse me, albino is fine.  He gives me the, you know, no problem thing. 
[02:25:00]  As I'm walking up the staircase, I run into a Latino chick.  And it just startled me because I don't know where she came from.  I wasn't looking.  And she's like in front of my condo on the second floor.  And I went, I'm sorry.  Can I help you?  And she goes, I'm sitting.  I'm sitting.  And I was confused.  I didn't because there's one level up higher than me.  And I know they weren't there.  So I thought maybe she came to, I just was startled. 
[02:25:30]  She came out of nowhere and she goes, what, you can't sit?  I'm just asking a question, hon.  That's all.  I'm just asking a question.  I didn't see where you came from.  Just like that.  And as she's walking away, I'm staring at her like, where'd this chick come from?  Albino.  Says, get in your house before I kill you, motherfucker.  Yo, I'm just, I'm not talking to you.  I'm just asking a question. 
[02:26:00]  Get in your house before I slap you like a bitch.  My blood fuel.  You've had it at this point.  But you're seconds away from leaving.  You finally snapped.  You're that close.  Seconds.  And these are moments that can define the rest of your life.  Is your whole family in the car?  They're in the car.  Me and your daughter.  My daughter is waiting for me.  She's oblivious because she has headphones on. 
[02:26:30]  So she has no clue what's going on.  So I look to my daughter to see if she's listening and watching this.  She's oblivious.  So I look back to him and he goes, what are you looking at?  And I stare at, and I'm staring at him.  And then I just went, okay, okay, I'm going to go in the house.  I'm going to drop the key.  I'm going to call the cops on him.  Call the cops.  And when the cops come, I'm going to be a dick.  I'm going to say he was dealing drugs in front of here and to frisk him. 
[02:27:00]  And he just threatened my life.  So this is where we're going to handle this.  How many times at this point have you called the cops?  This is the fourth time.  This is the fourth time in a weekend.  In a weekend, within a period of 18 hours.  So I call the cops because he's waiting.  Now everyone in the car is texting me.  And they're being, meh.  They have no clue what's going on.  So I'm trying to text go and just chill out.  No one knows what's going on.  But I don't want to walk by him because if he threatens me now with my kid, 
[02:27:30]  now I've got to do something.  And I also know it's not going to become a battle between me and albino.  It's going to be me and the Bloods and the Crips.  Yeah, yeah.  Against, and we're, we are Wilderbeasts.  Yeah, you're done.  We're Wilderbeasts.  The lions and the hyenas.  They're not even going to think what's going on.  It's just going to be a beat down.  I don't need my kids to watch that.  Right.  These are the moments where I go, I'm glad I don't have a gun. 
[02:28:00]  And it's really good not to have a gun law.  For people like me.  Because I would not have, I would have went, I dare him.  And I'm going to take him down in cold blood right in front.  I'm just going to, I have dreams of just me walking by him with my daughter.  And be like, what'd you say?  I said, I don't know.  I said, pow!  And while he's on the ground, the girls are going in horror.  I just want to, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.  And just watching it ooze out as I watch and just fury. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, that might be a problem.  And then they all start running and I just start pouring.  I go, who's next?  Who's next?  You want to see what's in the back pocket?  Like everyone, get the car.  I just, the scenarios go through your head.  And they go, and then you think of the guy on the subway with the glasses.  I am Bernard Gats.  And I will get away.  And so cops come. 
[02:29:00]  And I tell him, my life's been threatened.  This guy threatened my life.  My daughter's here.  You better get here quick.  I swear to God, this is the moment in life where I never hated an officer or the officers of law in my entire life to this moment.  Because half my family are officers.  But this guy's a first class douchebag.  And for reasons of, I would never disrespect, I won't say his name, but he works in the Wildwood Police Department. 
[02:29:30]  Fuck him.  He pulls up.  I finally come out.  I come out of the apartment.  And he goes, what's going on?  I said, excuse me, sir.  This guy's dealing drugs in front of here, which I don't have a problem with.  But as I walked by him, 11 years old, he threatened to kill me and slap me.  And he's going to punch me and kill me and all that jazz.  And he goes, all right, I heard your case.  Go stand over there.  Oh, shit.  So I said, no, no, no.  Hold on a second.  He goes, I heard your case.  Stand over there. 
[02:30:00]  I got your story.  So he turns to the albino.  And all he's doing is my wife gets out of the car.  And she's like, what is going on?  Finally realizing something is amiss.  She's like, what's going on?  Ma'am, get back in the car.  Why are you yelling at my husband?  Ma'am, get in the car.  Now I'm going to pull the two of you aside.  And we're going to have a problem with the two of you.  Now I want to forget the albino.  I want to kill the cops.  I want to kill him.  I want to beat him down like a little bitch that he is. 
[02:30:30]  So he turns into the albino.  And of course the albino, I do nothing.  He goes upstairs, he disrespects the girl.  You know, oof, oof.  So the cop goes, well, you know, it's a private property and you can't be hanging out on the staircase.  And, you know, all right, sir, come over here.  I come over there like a rotten child, I feel like.  A rotten little snitchy child. 
[02:31:00]  I come over and he goes, here's your situation.  You can, which I suggest, you take an apology from this man.  Or you can come downtown and fill out papers for a couple hours.  I went, all right, I'll take his apology.  Sure, I'll take his apology.  Only if he looks me in the eye, though.  So the guy's like, well, you know.  I said, so you're not going to do it.  You know you're going to pat him down or nothing.  Like I told him, he's like, sir, I just told you what your situation is. 
[02:31:30]  Are you going to take the apology or are you going to go downtown and fill out the papers?  So now I'm like, this guy's going to leave me to get murdered.  This fucking cop's going to leave me to get murdered.  I said, I'll take the apology, but he's got to look me in the eye.  Five tries later, the guy finally looks me in the eye, says he's sorry.  I turn to the cop.  I said, listen, don't leave until my whole family's out of here.  I'm lying.  And then I pulled him and I said, you know, my brother's a cop.  Oh, your brother's a cop?  Yeah, that's the first thing I said to you when he got out of the car. 
[02:32:00]  And I also told you he was, oh, you didn't tell me he was dealing drugs.  I said, the first thing I said to you is this guy's dealing drugs and he threatened my life.  He said, you did not say that.  And the only reason I say that is because the sergeant now is there.  If you told me that, I would have patted him down.  So now the story goes, I go, well, you know, I'll call my brother and I'll try to figure it.  He goes, listen, where's your brother?  I said, 100, in New York.  Oh, oh, oh, your brother's, oh, he's in New York City? 
[02:32:30]  New York City?  I said, yeah, and as that changes anything, he starts having a meltdown.  And he goes, listen, don't let this weekend bother you.  It's the worst goddamn weekend of Wildhood.  He's just losing it?  I swear my kid's life, he goes, these people are animals.  They're animals.  And what they have done to the city of Wildhood is a disgrace.  There was 300 rapes last night, two murders.  These people are animals and the mayor doesn't care. 
[02:33:00]  He goes, we're shorthanded.  So it all came out like he's just, he's just, uh.  They're just going through the motions.  Living through the weekend.  He's just trying to survive himself.  He turns around and he goes, listen, please come back 4th of July.  It's all friendly white families.  I said, yeah, I'm making my appointment now.  Can't wait to come back to Wildwood, New Jersey.  But did they wait while you left?  They waited till I left. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, that's good.  Fuck that.  So at the end, you, yes, Wildwood.  Now here's the funny thing, because my wife's, uh, I'll say she's half born again now.  She was full born again.  Now she's half born again.  The whole weekend, she's like, I don't know why God put that in our laps.  She's like, I'm a very open-minded.  I'm going to pray to God and ask him why he did that.  And it really messed her.  She's like, I don't, I don't know if you should be famous. 
[02:34:00]  Like, why is the devil doing it?  We're good people.  Because they're animals.  We're good people.  Yeah, we are good people, but you can't be in certain scenarios.  Didn't people recognize you from half-baked?  Like, that's a big Chappelle vehicle.  They're all the Chappelle.  Unfortunately, if they were, no, which was weird.  The boardwalk, I got more recognition, but these guys didn't.  I don't know if it's because they were Latino.  The blacks do.  Yeah.  The blacks all love me.  Matter of fact, one time I'm going to Shea Stadium, and I've got some of my wife's friends, 
[02:34:30]  and they're all, the church gang, and the mission group.  So I'm like, all right, well, I'll bring them all to Shea Stadium.  We're going to a Met game.  I said, but I'm drinking.  So we're going to a Met game.  Tons of traffic, FDR.  I pull over, and I cut through Harlem.  As I'm going through Harlem, I mean, we're in the deep part of Harlem.  I turn to this guy who's milky white.  Kids are in the back.  My kids are oblivious to anything. 
[02:35:00]  They could be driving through hell, and they're like, well, it's a cool kid.  Can we get out and play?  So the guy looks nervous.  I go, listen.  I know this sounds crazy to you, but if anything ever went down, this is where I would feel  probably the safest in my life is perhaps right here in Harlem amongst these people because  they know me, they trust me, and I trust them.  He's like, really?  I even finished a sentence.  I swear to God.  I hear a tap on my window, and I jumped five feet, and the guy's like, oh, shit! 
[02:35:30]  Let me get a picture!  That's a nigga in half bank!  That's a silly nigga in half bank!  Do that shit when you order the food!  See what I'm talking about?  So, unfortunately, no.  I think if they were black, it would have been safer, and I would have been fine.  But I don't know.  These guys were from a different...  Yeah, that's just...  It made me wonder, man, when...  That guy really did throw me... 
[02:36:00]  There was a part of my life where I became a lot more open-minded, but that incident with  that albino, just my daughter's there, my family's there.  I didn't threaten you, there was no threat, and he just turned around blatantly, shut  the fuck up, I'm gonna slap your bitch, and I'll kill you.  He said, I'm gonna slap your bitch, or slap your...  I'm gonna slap you, you bitch, get up in your house.  That...  Could you have taken him?  Oh, easy.  He was a little punk kid.  He was a little fucking kid.  So, unless he had a weapon, there was no... 
[02:36:30]  You don't know what he's packing.  If he wasn't packing, I tell you right now, I would have killed him, because the rage I  have is a father, I would have...  He's just...  He's going for the big swing in front of...  And he's also in front of his chicks, so he's just trying to impress the chicks.  I'm trying to live for life.  He's trying to win for a score, I'm going to kill.  There's a big difference.  I'm not going down, I'm gonna kill him.  So, yeah, I could have easily...  But, thank God, because I would have killed him.  I would have killed him.  Jesus. 
[02:37:00]  But those...  Here, attention...  And that's why I think segregation works.  And it's not a racial thing.  It's...  Everyone understands each...  And when you mix the groups, whether they enjoy each other or not, there's some groups  that just based on hate.  And this was the opposite hate.  This was opposite hate.  So, as much as blacks and Latinos or whoever would say white people hate, they proved on  that weekend they have just as much hate and disrespect for someone that's probably more 
[02:37:30]  open-minded than they could have ever imagined.  Yeah.  This guy threatened my life in front of my children.  They obviously...  Just trying to get the fuck out of town.  Just trying to leave.  I'm just trying to get out of here.  And they didn't pat him down, obviously, huh?  No!  Jeez.  So, screw Wildhood.  That one cop.  I wish I could...  I wish we had his number.  I'd love to talk to a little fag.  So, you were born again for how long?  It started four years ago. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, wow.  Okay.  But now it's on a...  It's reached a happy medium.  But when they first get born again, it's like...  And I don't like that term.  It's really annoying.  Because you instantly think freak.  Like a stigma to it, yeah.  You think they walk around on a corner with a Bible going, have you found Jesus?  So, that, you know, it's...  At first, you would drop, like, you know, what would Jesus...  Hon, please.  What would Jesus think? 
[02:38:30]  Don't worry about it.  What were you going to ask, though?  No, no, no, no.  This is basically what you're saying.  What is the...  Because you know her.  She's your wife.  She's your friend.  And all of a sudden...  Yes.  How does God start coming up more than it used to?  Like, is it like, look, I've had this moment that I want to talk to you about?  Or how does it happen?  You want the story?  You want the epiphany?  The story is great.  I didn't think you were going to tell the story.  I don't know it.  It's...  Basically, we're on the outs, all right?  She's tried everything.  She's tried the forum.  She's tried new diets. 
[02:39:00]  And whatever reason, she's just not happy in life.  Maybe it's me.  Maybe it was part of me.  I don't know.  We have two kids.  She's very...  Had problems with the two...  My attitude is, like, we live in a sick house.  We got three acres of woods.  We got a pool.  We make more money than I ever imagined I would make.  I got two kids.  While everyone else we know are trying to have kids and a test tube in it and exchanging blood. 
[02:39:30]  And we're just, oh, wow, kid.  Oh, wow, another one.  This is a miracle.  So, I got a healthy outlook on life.  Whatever.  Things are good.  No complaints in life.  We're on the outs.  And I'm at the point where I can't live with this human anymore.  We've asked.  We're trying to get help.  I agreed.  Let's go to therapist, whatever.  Did you ever get into those arguments like you're just not hearing each other, right?  Like, no matter what she says, you want to just go, look, you'll understand if you just 
[02:40:00]  shut the fuck up.  Just stop fucking talking.  Yeah.  Well, that also is a, that comes with patience and time.  You have to learn.  You know what's really bizarre?  You're going to laugh at this.  A great book is Man of Remars.  And I'll tell you why.  Because it makes, there's sections in there that explain, as you say this, this is what  they hear.  As they say this, this is what you hear. 
[02:40:30]  Which is very true.  Right.  Like, when a chick takes over for you, and they're like, let me help you with that.  In their mind, they're saying, I want to help you.  In your mind, you're going, you don't trust what I'm doing?  And you think I'm an asshole?  You don't think I can do this?  And so that's why we get pissed.  It's that simple.  It's just, we're two different worlds.  Two different tribes.  Like, in my mind, I'm saying, I like to fuck other girls.  No, I fucked up.  I was saying.  It's the other way.  I fucked you.  That's what she hears. 
[02:41:00]  That's what she hears.  All right.  Back to what you're saying.  So, with that, I'm done.  I had one of those moments where I pulled over, and I'm looking for an apartment.  I said, all right.  I'm going to take care of the kids.  I'm going to be there in the morning.  They get up.  I take care of them.  When they go to bed, I'm out of the house.  I'm going to live up the road.  But I'll put my kids ahead of anything.  You get help somehow.  I don't care if you've got to bang people. 
[02:41:30]  I don't care if you've got to cheat.  Whatever you've got to do, just go do it, because you're a miserable animal.  Wow.  Some of my darkness is coming.  That's how I felt at the time.  That's how you felt.  Right.  I pull over, and now I've had divorce in my family, and it's underrated.  You're fine.  You've got no kids.  Believe me, no.  But it's so much darker and uglier than everyone thinks.  People say, I ain't divorced.  No.  Most of the time, it's ugly.  It's dark.  And if you have kids, it fucks them up for generations. 
[02:42:00]  It's not just like, oh, the kids get to see dad.  No.  It fucks them up.  They don't know, is it because of me?  Why isn't my dad?  I hate my dad's new girlfriend.  He's taking the girlfriend over me.  And it's a lot of fucked up things.  It fucks up their relationships and the future.  I've seen it with all my nieces and nephews.  So I'm strongly for buster balls to fight to keep this shit together, work shit out.  It's not a fucking party.  It's tribal shit. 
[02:42:30]  We're going to fight together for the rest of our lives?  Let's fucking do this.  So I pull over to the side of the road.  I'm like, you know, I start crying.  I'm praying.  I'm like, God, if you're going to save this shit, you better step in now because I'm about to walk away.  I've done everything you wanted.  I never cheated.  I never said, Dad, I'm a good fucking guy.  I do everything I get.  I said, Dad, what the fuck do you want from me?  Everything she wants, I get it. 
[02:43:00]  What the fuck do you want from me?  So I have an apartment lined up a quarter mile away.  I go to put my deposit on.  And the guy goes, oh, Brewer, I'm really sorry, man.  These Mexicans came and they had the cash.  I said, well, I had the cash.  I saw you last night.  I said, I know, but, you know, you said you're going to be here by 11.  I said, it's fucking, it's two o'clock.  Well, I know, man.  They got here in the morning and you weren't sure what to move.  I just, I need to get rid of this apartment. 
[02:43:30]  Get this apartment away.  I want to kill him.  Now I'm looking for a new apartment.  About a week later, I get home.  My wife is in the living room.  She's all fucking weird looking.  Eyes are all swollen.  I'm like, what's going on with you?  She's like, something really fucking weird happened.  Oh, no.  What, what happened?  Just, just see something.  I'm thinking one of the kids are dead by, by the way she looks. 
[02:44:00]  So, I go, what, what happened to it?  Well, I went, I went to a, I went to a coffee shop.  Yeah.  And a woman behind the counter said, we really should talk because I, I, I want to do something  for you.  And, and I'm thinking, oh, where's this story going?  Right.  Sounds interesting.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  So I, huh.  Sounds very, very interesting. 
[02:44:30]  And she goes, and I said, all right, well, what happened?  She, she asked me to follow her to her house.  Right.  Okay.  So you just, do you know her?  Well, I mean, I know her, but I don't really know her.  So you went to her house?  Yes.  And then it got really weird.  I said, am I going to like this story?  Am I really going to piss me off?  I go, what happened when you got to the, what happened when you got to the house? 
[02:45:00]  Well, her husband was there.  Uh-oh.  Now I'm like, whoa.  All right.  This is going to piss me off.  Yeah.  This is going to piss me off.  This is going to piss me off real bad.  Yeah.  She's like, and then I don't know what happened.  And they, they, they said, we, we want to pray for you and your lost soul and to save  your marriage.  And they got on their knees.  Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What?  What happened?  Yeah.  Right.  Wait, wait, wait.  What? 
[02:45:30]  What?  I mean, this is the furthest thing I imagined.  She was like, they got on their, they got on their knees and they started praying.  And I, and I, as they were praying for my life and I didn't feel better and I just got  this overwhelming feeling and I was, did you like it or was it weird?  Like they were kneeling, praying.  Yeah.  I said, what, what did you do?  It's like, I don't know.  I felt stupid and I didn't know what to, right.  Like what's going on? 
[02:46:00]  What do you do?  And she goes, and as I drove away, I just started crying because I, I couldn't believe that two  souls would go out of their way just to pray for my sanity and my life and my soul and  my marriage and my family and blah, blah, blah, just to get better.  So now I'm like, okay, well now what?  What does this mean?  Like it was, I don't know.  I just, I don't know.  I got a lot of thinking to do. 
[02:46:30]  A couple of weeks later, uh, she's going to like a local churchy thing.  Um, then it slowly started with, you know, you know, it's really weird.  Everything you say is like in the Bible.  You never read the Bible?  No, I did not.  You sure?  You know, no, I've never read the Bible.  Well, everything they talk about, you, you preach it all the time.  I go, yeah, I know.  A lot of it is like deep thought, common sense of, of looking after one another. 
[02:47:00]  Well, so it turns more, you should come, you should come, you should come.  So I'm like, ah, you know, they play softball there.  So I go there.  I eventually go there.  But what happens is now, anytime we have an argument, the argument normally would last three weeks, a month, month and a half of, of just not talking to you, pissed off, slamming things, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:47:30]  But now, after like in two hours, she would come downstairs and go, you know, it wasn't you that I was lashing out to.  I'm just, I'm not happy with myself right now.  And I'm really working on myself.  And I'm sorry I lashed out.  Sometimes I'm jealous of you.  And I was like, all right, when's church?  Every Sunday.  Why don't you try this study they got on Wednesday nights?  So, in that sense, it started really changing her. 
[02:48:00]  She started getting really attractive because the inside beauty started showing.  And at first, I'm not going to say it was a little bit of a battle because everything was Christian.  Everything.  I had to go to a Christian concert.  It, this guy, Chris Tomlin, it was the, it was the case.  When everyone shuts their eyes and puts their hands up.  Oh, no, it's worse. 
[02:48:30]  And start waving their hands around.  This is, this is, this is what drove me nuts.  This drove me nuts.  It's, first of all, it was the safest concert I ever felt.  I show, you know, I show up with the bandana and the chain hanging.  Let's go!  Lights are out!  I'm the only one drinking.  No line at the beer line?  There's no line at the beer line.  I'm the only one there.  But we would hang out in the back deck. 
[02:49:00]  She would never hang out in my back deck.  A beautiful deck out in the woods, shooting stars all night.  I'd always, I'd always go, how can you, I mean, just look at the stars.  Like, what, what is going on here?  Who are we?  What is this?  Are we dust?  I mean, what is this?  What is all this?  The stars and the trees.  What the fuck is this?  What is it?  Why am I not a gopher?  Why am I not a star?  Like, just shit like that.  You know?  And she'd be like, whatever. 
[02:49:30]  Now we go to the Chris Tomlin concert.  First of all, whatever, I'm not going to, I'm not going to, we got a sample of his music.  Oh, let's hear Chris Tomlin.  Oh, God.  Are you ready for this?  You ready for this?  Picture yourself spending $25.  Now you're going to see a concert.  And, oh, wait till you hear his voice.  Sounds like Coldplay.  Let me see you rock a little bit.  Oh, and they're all.  He's got a Coldplay thing going on.  He's on the piano and everything.  He's the good looking Christian guy. 
[02:50:00]  That's what he is.  Look at him.  A lot of these guys copy U2 like, it's, it's, it's a, it's a crime.  It's a crime.  How many of them just blatantly go, can we take a U2 tune and just put Jesus there?  Why'd you start the video there?  He doesn't know.  Why would he know?  I'll tell you why.  Because his stupidity is epic.  So this is, here, turn it to us. 
[02:50:30]  Every song is this.  They all know the words.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Is it all about God?  Yes.  This one's called How Great Is Our God?  Yes.  Why?  Which is fine.  You know, the tribal Indians do that, too.  That's, I get no problem with that.  But it's such a, so, all right, I'm watching this and I'm stomach, I'm like, okay.  I'm not, you know, I'm just sitting there like, okay.  Was your wife singing along? 
[02:51:00]  She's singing along, but she's not doing a hand thing, which I was very happy about.  I'm not doing a hand thing.  So now with that.  It's high.  It's high.  They put the words up behind him so he gets to learn.  Every song, he does.  Yeah, very breathy.  Oh, God.  Every song is.  Oh, Jesus.  I know you born again women are madly in love with me and you wish I was human. 
[02:51:30]  You think this guy gets pussy?  I don't know.  Oh.  Jesus pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  And you know what?  I don't know the guy.  In all defense.  I don't know.  So this is the part that pisses me off.  I'm at the concert.  He sings four songs.  And he goes, and now we have a great friend of mine.  Guy comes out and gives a 45-minute sermon.  Oh, shit. 
[02:52:00]  And boom.  I was violently mad.  Like I wanted to throw a chair at the insulting concept of what this man did.  The guy comes out and he goes, I want to show you something.  I want to show you the stars.  And he shows the galaxy.  Then he goes, he's like, a star. 
[02:52:30]  And this is going on for an hour.  It's 450 light years a day.  Light years is broken down to X amount of it, which is broken down to X amount of feet,  which is broken down to so many hours of our life.  And when you think about the stars and the format and this and that,  we're just this little crumb in her.  And I'm looking at my wife and she's got the Hulk right in her mouth.  It's like, yeah, we really are.  There's a tiny little gem in the world.  And I'm like, do I not talk about this every night on the deck? 
[02:53:00]  This is deck talk.  This is deck talk.  This guy's making $40,000 a night for deck talk.  So this is what this is.  You could be a messiah, Jim.  Oh, I'm working on it.  Oh, trust me.  I'm pulling the carpet out from all this.  And I'm not going to take money.  That's what's going to shake them all.  So anyway, here's the part.  The guy talks about, did you know when Jesus came and he died in all of us? 
[02:53:30]  There's a perfect plan for, you know, the perfect plan, blah, blah, blah.  And we have a chromosome that builds our life.  And he shows a picture of a chromosome that's this weird shape.  But he's trying to convince the audience that it's the shape of the cross.  And he's doing, and it's the most awkward looking cross I've ever seen.  He's like, so don't you see that Jesus made the cross in all of us? 
[02:54:00]  And I went, wow, these guys got some gimmick going.  They got some racket.  But were they all expecting a sermon?  The people knew a sermon?  I have no clue, but I'll tell you what.  You've got to think they're expecting it.  You've got to think the word.  But to go on a Sunday, I already had to do the time at church.  Do the time.  And no offense.  You go to church, knock yourself out.  And if it makes your life better, wonderful.  But now I've got to go to a concert and see church again. 
[02:54:30]  And a sermon, yeah.  Dude, so anyway.  This video has over a million views, by the way.  Yeah, it's probably the same three people.  That means obsessed.  No, because that's the date.  That means a lot of fucking people are into this.  Chris Tomlin.  Never heard of him.  A lot of chicks are into him.  A lot of Christian.  Is that his real name, Chris Tomlin?  Or is it C-H-R-I-S-T?  He probably likes the Chris with the T after it.  Ah, Christ.  Christ.  Christ.  So anyway.  And this song's an hour.  It's just like.  It's still going.  Bad Metallica.  That is.  Yes. 
[02:55:00]  They're nine minutes long.  He's standing up now.  Now, this is really a Coldplay ripoff.  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  There's no Coldplay.  Listen.  He's on the fucking keyboard.  He's jumping up and down.  This guy's awful.  And like you said, a little U2-y, too.  Oh, they're all U2-y.  It's so annoying.  I go, all right.  I don't get Christian Stacey.  Why are you not allowed to play just good music without whatever?  Well, they're fucking loving it.  Of course they're loving it.  They're also clapping for God, though.  This guy gets God applause, too.  It's God.  It's God applause.  It's not even as God. 
[02:55:30]  You can't have a bad show.  You represent God.  You can't have a bad show because you've got God also.  You represent God in the house.  Which really.  I'd love to see him go to the front of the stage and go.  At the end of the day, that pisses me off.  Yeah, motherfuckers.  Like, just like, yeah.  Yeah.  Gonna rock the shit out of this fucking place.  Now go home and fly.  Or if he just started playing the piano.  Hey, Lonnie Lilo.  Hey, Lilo, girl.  Her name was.  Can I get fucking Valby? 
[02:56:00]  Go on tour with Metallica.  Dude, I got a great.  I'm with.  If you're starting to know the story, we're going to take a break because I'm ready to leak.  I have to piss my face.  All right.  I got a great.  Are you done with the.  Born again.  Born again.  James Hetfield story.  All right.  Let's do that after the break.  And can we get an update on the pizza man?  Because everyone's asking.  Dude, let me tell you something.  After the break.  After the break.  I'll tell you about pizza man.  Quick plug to Jim.  Is he going to be the Stress Factory?  Yeah, I got it.  I got it.  Stress Factory Friday and Saturday.  7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5.  Ha, ha.  Also, I'm not high for the book. 
[02:56:30]  That's my book.  October 5th.  As you were talking, I was wondering if you had ever written a book.  Wow.  You could pre-order that.  And I wrote it.  We're going to break.  I wrote it.  What is it about in like 30 seconds?  It's autobiography, behind the scenes, half-baked, a lot of my family, a lot of good SNL stories.  I only throw one major person under the bus.  Can we guess?  No, you won't guess.  Won't guess.  Because it's a head writer.  Oh, okay.  Who became a big successful.  He leeched on to a very big comedic actor, Will Ferrell. 
[02:57:00]  And did a lot.  And he's got a big movie coming out now.  We'll get into it.  All right.  I'm not high is the book.  You can pre-order now on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Borders Books.  Jim Brewer, the greatest storyteller ever.  This is the OPN Anthony Show on the Fire and Sirius XM.  Did you know ACDC's done? 
[02:57:30]  What?  I heard rumors.  What happened?  From the horse's mouth.  Really?  You know the boys well.  That's what I heard.  I heard some things.  What are you hearing?  What I heard was, ah, Jimmy, me son.  After July, I'm done.  I can't do it no more.  Really?  I'm too old.  However, I am working on something kind of cool with Slash.  And so, you know, when I'm super group, things go off for a year.  You're going, oh, that sounds interesting. 
[02:58:00]  But.  Who is that?  As a whole, ACDC, rumor is, unless you've seen them, they're done.  You're never going to see them again.  Really?  Yes.  No one else is talking about this.  Wow.  Because no one else can hang.  Damn, buddy.  That's it.  I'm just telling you.  I'm telling you.  This is it.  Think about it.  They're in their 60s.  How old can you sing, Brian Black, I hear the sound.  60.  Three.  Blasting that. 
[02:58:30]  Just fucking.  Oh.  Do you still smoke, Brian Johnson?  That's a good question.  I saw him recently, and he didn't.  We hung out for two or three hours and drinking wine, and there wasn't one cigarette.  Oh, okay.  That means he's not.  That means he's not smoking.  So I would assume no.  Oh, yeah, because if you're a smoker.  You got some wine going on?  Especially wine.  I mean, we were whining it, which was really funny, because we were sitting down.  I had my nieces, who's kind of prim and proper. 
[02:59:00]  She's very prim and proper.  She's getting married to a very collegiate-looking Connecticut man.  And it's after a show in Sarasota, and he texts like, hey, I heard you're in town.  I said, yes.  What are you doing?  Well, I got some family in town, and we're going to this restaurant.  Sure enough, before they come, I told Mike, I was like, listen, this guy's fun.  I don't know where the night's going to go. 
[02:59:30]  I'm warning you now.  I'm telling you right now.  Fair warning.  And I'm just saying, we could end up on a boat before the night's over.  Who knows where we're going?  You don't know.  No judging.  Let's just drop our guard and have fun.  And I don't think those two ever laughed so hard.  They're like, that was the hardest I ever laughed in my whole life.  He'll go into this brilliant conversation, deep conversation.  His father was in World War II.  So that's kind of where we talk a lot, like World War II. 
[03:00:00]  And he'll go, you know, Jim, it was a scary time in life.  You know, the fuck, I mean, if you think about the size of Germany, and they fucking went  right into Britain, they went right in across Europe.  I mean, they have the greatest fucking army in the world.  Hands down, they make the best weapons, the best anything.  They are very underestimated.  But the most brilliant thing about Germany is they don't have a fucking word for a nipple. 
[03:00:30]  What kind of fucking country can create a flying saucer and not have a word for a nipple?  Pull on some more fucking wine.  He is really just like a fun pirate.  He really is like, get us some bread and some wine and we'll tell great stories of the road.  You know a guy named Sam?  I know a bunch of guys named Sam.  He says he hangs, he's one of your neighbors? 
[03:01:00]  Uh, he's a neighbor?  Yeah.  Because he wants to talk about Pizza Man.  I'll let him talk about Pizza Man.  Let me hear about Pizza Man.  But I, he's...  And you have a Pizza Man update?  Yeah, sort of.  Oh, Sam, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, bro, or it's your neighbor.  We were the guys with the party trailer for your birthday party.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you mean the party trailer?  I had a, um, I had a block party.  Yeah.  And these, and, and I didn't do it a hundred percent right, but I, I had an idea for the 
[03:01:30]  block party.  And the block party was, I wanted to take it over.  I said, I want to have a full blown movie theater for the kids, which I had, where a truck was  going to come for 300 bucks during the day.  The kids play Game Boy and rock, you know, on the back of the truck.  Yes.  And no, and they set up those, those blow up screens.  Yeah.  And so while that was going on, I had a band at the end of the block for the adults and  karaoke.  Um, I also had, uh, uh, an ice cream truck coming. 
[03:02:00]  Some of the other neighbors, they meant well, but they're like, no, we can save so much money.  And once it came down to money, that's when it's like, yeah, if I'm going to pay 25, 30  dot, why don't we pay?  Whatever.  I knew, I knew I was taking a hit anyway.  I was willing to drop a couple grand just to put the neighborhood together.  Yeah.  So with that, someone said, no, no, no.  My computer can link up and we can watch the movie on a thing.  I said, okay.  All right.  You be, you be the head of that. 
[03:02:30]  And I can, I can get free ice cream.  Okay.  P.S.  Cut to four in the afternoon.  They're all wasted.  And I got every kid in the neighborhood go, where's the movie theater?  I said, talk to Mrs. So-and-so.  Mrs. So-and-so has been missing for five hours.  So the movie theater never, never happened.  And neither did the ice cream because they got drunk and forgot about it.  Although they're fun as hell.  So I put all the kids like, we never got our ice cream.  We never got to this day. 
[03:03:00]  They're like, you never showed the movie.  You clearly said on the flyer.  Movie, guitar hero, and ice cream.  And you dropped the ball.  I'm like, all right.  Well, whatever.  But this guy showed up.  Sam showed up with his pickup truck.  And he had this big freaking like plasma looking screen.  Nice.  And he was watching movies all night.  And you could tell the next time I got to collaborate with him.  He knows how to figure this shit out. 
[03:03:30]  He knows how to figure it out.  Right.  So what's up, Sam?  Hey, bro.  I just wanted to let the listeners know, you know, the last time when you talked about Pizza  Man, you know, I thought my family was the only family that actually had problems with  him.  I just found out like the entire town had problems with him.  And your story is pretty much dead on.  But what you were explaining for an hour about about him.  And, you know, just a warning.  I mean, even though you have no trespassing signs for no hunting on your property, that  doesn't stop Pizza Man and his buddies. 
[03:04:00]  Let me tell you.  Do tell us a story.  Did you, was he hunting on your grounds?  Well, there was one day I was sick and I didn't go to work.  And, you know, suddenly I hear this knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on the door.  I'm like, who is this guy?  And it was him and his buddy.  And, you know, I told him that they weren't allowed to hunt because, you know, the neighbors,  you know, obviously we all banded together with it, you know, with the kids being around.  Of course.  Children, neighborhood, three-acre lots. 
[03:04:30]  You can't.  No shooting animals.  Lots of deer come running through, though.  Non-stop, yes.  I've been there with a herd of deer.  The bullet's going to go further than three acres.  Yes.  Yes.  Go to Pennsylvania.  It's a half hour away.  Right.  Go to hunting parks.  It's all over Jersey.  But it is tempting when you see a whole herd of them.  No, it's really not.  It's really not.  Then you, and I told the pussy man, pizza man, pizza man is a pussy man because anyone  that wants to hunt a deer that's ten feet away, you're a pussy. 
[03:05:00]  That takes away hunting.  It's like tackling a five-year-old.  What's the thrill?  I can get the kid.  You're a fag.  You're a fag.  A real hunting is you've got to go on the train, wait for the sun.  You don't kill it in the backyard.  Fag.  Go hunt squirrels.  All right, I'm venting.  Go ahead.  It's true.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, they were after this 12-point buck that was running around in the neighborhood,  and the guy really, really, his friend, it was actually his friend that really wanted  this buck. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, and I could have sworn they had some firearms in the car.  I'm like, what are these guys trying to do?  You know, they're trying to go after this one deer that's been rolling around.  For $50.  For $50.  That's what Pizza Man owes you.  I guess $65 for the horns.  I said, you know what?  You're partially retarded.  He really is.  So anyway, long story short, you're right.  The whole town had a problem with Pizza Man.  Pizza Man is that bad neighbor.  Sam, we'll try to get something together this week.  All right, Sam. 
[03:06:00]  Now, last time you were on the show, you talked about Pizza Man for an hour.  We can't get into that again, obviously.  Right.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah, the story is up on YouTube.  I don't know how many people have, I have not seen it, but I could tell you my entire  town has seen when I came up here and talked about Pizza Man, and this is where it started.  It started with me going to a little convenience store, a little place called Crousers.  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[03:06:30]  Jersey.  Very Jersey.  Yes.  Very Jersey.  I go into Crousers, and there's a guy there, Nelson, who used to do something with the  Pizza Man.  I'm not quite sure what he would do.  I think Pizza Man does everything cash and sneaking behind the doors.  So Pizza Man, I walk in there, a cop, I hear from behind, so what's going on with Pizza  Man?  Now, I turn around, I'm like, how do you know about Pizza Man? 
[03:07:00]  He goes, oh, we've all watched that 4,000 times.  Oh, shit.  He goes, we need to know, who's the lawyer?  Who's Pizza Man's lawyer?  I tell them the lawyer, and they're like, let me tell you something, that guy's had his  bar's license taken, he's an old man, I feel bad for him, because Pizza Man manipulated  him, blah, blah, blah.  And so they tell me a story that Pizza Man is, and I think I told him it was going to 
[03:07:30]  be tried for a dumb incident he made.  He bullied his way into the town pool.  Right.  You told that?  I told all that.  So I'm not going to go into it.  Two days later, I'm in the grocery store.  Not one, but about four people come up to me.  I'm down, I'm down like the aisle, and this lady comes up, she goes, can I just tell you  about Pizza Man?  I went, you know about Pizza Man? 
[03:08:00]  She goes, can I tell you?  You know what my teenage daughters did last week?  The whole weekend, she had a slumber party, and I hear them laughing and laughing, and  I thought they were watching, like, really bad art movies.  I went downstairs, they were watching you telling the Pizza Man story on Opie and Anthony, and  they did it until four in the morning.  She goes, everyone in Mendham, Chester, everyone knows about the story of Pizza Man.  You find the clip, E-Rock, for the people at home?  We got a bunch of new listeners the last month or so. 
[03:08:30]  It's in four parts, because it was so long.  It's in four parts.  It's over an hour, yeah.  It's almost at 30,000 views.  Well, I can tell you 25 of them are in my town.  It's not bad for an audio clip on YouTube.  And what, just Jim Brewer, Pizza Man?  Pizza Man or Pizza Guy, it's labeled both.  With Jim Brewer, though, right?  Okay.  And so he now, so what happened after, we left it off where lawyers, blah, blah, blah,  he sent some cheesy lawyer.  I think we left off where he sent the letter, and then I sent the letter. 
[03:09:00]  He sent another letter.  And in the other letter, his dopey lawyer wrote, he took a piece of paper.  Like, when you get a divorce, I don't have to tell you, you make arrangements.  To have them killed.  Right, you go.  You know what?  I agree that you have to pick up the kid on Wednesdays, and you're not allowed to come  here, and the kids are not allowed to be alone here. 
[03:09:30]  So in it, the mother and the husband, Pizza Man and the wife, agreed not to have the kids  alone with just me, which quite frankly, I never want that anyway.  Yeah.  Why would I want to be alone with someone else's kids?  Period.  Period.  So, he takes that part of the article of the agreement between, and he pastes it to, so  it looks like it was ordered by the court, a court order, and he sends it to me in this 
[03:10:00]  threatening manner, again, like, you will, the consequences, we're going to have to take  action against you, and blah, blah, blah.  Jesus.  So, now, I send the letter to the lawyer, and my lawyer, again, animal, animal, they  own record companies, this is, this is not rocking, this is enjoyment for them.  Yeah, yeah, fun.  The guy laughs, and he goes, I can't, never in my life have I seen a lawyer toy with papers, 
[03:10:30]  we're going to have to take his bar's license away, we're going to go after him, because  he legally toyed with legal papers.  How could they tell, did he do it in a photocopy it, or was it actually?  Yeah, like, it will say, like, the court order, and then they'll put, and the only, and then  it was a paste of just what they agreed to in typing, and then it made it look like, ordered  by the court of, yeah, this is how stupid he is, so stupid, okay, a bag of Roxy, a bag 
[03:11:00]  of Roxy for you, and a bag of Roxy for your lawyer.  Yeah.  So, they send, my lawyer sends him, and says, I'll have you know that I'm very suspicious  that you toyed with legal papers, and we're going to have to now legally go after you,  and your client, and your bar's license, everything.  They called the next morning.  We are so sorry.  This is a big misunderstanding. 
[03:11:30]  I don't legally know what's going on with Pizza Man.  I don't represent Pizza Man.  You will never hear from us again.  We're sorry for any inconvenience.  They knew they fucked up.  We are so sorry.  Never want to hear.  So, now.  Fuck Pizza Man and his ass.  We hate fucking Pizza Man.  Yeah.  So, now, lawyer calls up.  He's like, great news.  I heard from Pizza Man.  He goes, and I've got to be honest with you, he is as dopey as you explain him. 
[03:12:00]  He goes, just acts everything.  Everything the way you said is hilarious, and he really is a bag of rocks.  So, I go, well, I want to go after him now.  I want to go after him for harassment.  He goes, listen.  Listen.  If you drive by, it gives you the finger.  He looks at you the wrong way.  But you call, and now you can go after him.  Just leave it.  He's done.  You're never going to hear from him again.  Well, I didn't hear from him again.  However, a couple days later now, everyone in town is going, oh, my God. 
[03:12:30]  I watched that Opie and Anthony Pizza Man thing.  We have Pizza Man parties.  We drive by his Pizza Man place.  We know exactly that.  And stories.  Stories are coming up.  People are going, did you know that I treated Pizza Man's horse?  And the other horse died.  And he got killed because he was malnutritioned and Pizza Man.  And I had people that worked for him start emailing me going, you know, Pizza Man threw a bottle at my head.  I'm only 16 years old. 
[03:13:00]  Pizza Man curses.  He got in a fight at the park.  He fought here.  Fucking legendary.  Everywhere I go.  They have a Pizza Man story.  Someone has a Pizza Man story and how much they hate Pizza Man.  He screwed me here.  He threatened my mother.  He bullied my grandfather.  He came in here.  He started a fight.  Pizza Man can lick it.  Nobody likes Pizza Man.  Nobody.  They hate Pizza Man. 
[03:13:30]  So with that, convenience store up in the corner, I am now getting gas.  And as I'm getting gas, Pizza Man comes in.  Oh, shit.  And Pizza Man, me and him lock eyes.  And I stare him down.  And he now goes and parks the car to get coffee.  So I'm like, oh, you know what?  I'm done getting gas, but I can use some coffee. 
[03:14:00]  What an asshole.  How do you like your coffee?  I get out of the car.  I go right next to him.  I don't even say a word.  I'm just standing right next to him.  And he's looking down the counter.  That's what Pizza Man does.  He never looks you in the eye.  He's looking down the counter, and he goes, hey, hey, Jim, how you doing?  I don't even answer him.  So I go to get my coffee.  He goes, no, don't use that one. 
[03:14:30]  That one, no good.  Use that one.  And I'm just staring at him.  And so he pours the coffee for me.  He puts the coffee in front.  And he never says a word, and I never say a word to him.  So now he won't get online.  So I just pick up the whole time.  I mean, it's right back to Jefferson Avenue, Long Island, king of the block.  You're going to feel my wrath now.  So now I'm online, and I'm just staring at him. 
[03:15:00]  And he won't get in line.  And he's just circling his coffee.  I wait till I leave.  I'm about to leave.  As I'm leaving, then he gets in line.  I go, you know what?  I'm not done.  I want to.  I got to get cash.  I forgot I got no cash.  So I go back in the cash line.  He's then, he's looking at me.  I'm staring back at him.  I walked out the door with him.  I walked him all the way to his door.  He got in the car.  I looked at him.  He never looked at me.  I watched him drive away. 
[03:15:30]  And that was the last I've ever dealt with pizza man.  Not a fucking word, huh?  Not a word.  Now I don't look at him.  He don't look at me.  Oh, he's still in the neighborhood.  His house is.  He's not.  He's not.  He's up the street, sort of.  His establishment still works.  His establishment.  And from what I heard from rumors, I can't officially say.  But he hasn't taken care of financial needs to his family. 
[03:16:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  Deadbeat action going on.  Correct.  I didn't say it, Anthony.  I believe you just did.  Yeah, of course.  And the courts are now after him.  And the court, now he went to court, supposedly, and said, I'm losing money because of the Opie and Anthony Jim Brewer pizza man.  Oh, yeah, great.  Yeah, sure you are.  I think you were losing money long before. 
[03:16:30]  This is how dopey he is.  He had a, he put in the article that he was retiring his pizza plate.  He's retiring so he can make his three million and walk.  And then he didn't retire.  And so, long story short, I can't wait to pizza man as a long guy.  I never want to see him again.  I kind of feel bad for him, but I don't.  It's heading that way?  He's going to have to leave the neighborhood for good?  He doesn't go anywhere, and nobody likes him.  It's sick.  It's deranged.  Nothing worse than when you start feeling sorry for someone you hate so much. 
[03:17:00]  I feel bad for him.  And just watch them fuck shit up so bad for themselves that you're like, I kind of feel bad, but I don't want to because I hate them.  Yes, and to be honest with you, the minute that story, the blessing was coming on here and talking about it, because the minute I left, people came out of the fire department, police department, people in ShopRite, people at the bagel store, people at the other pizza places, people from soccer teams. 
[03:17:30]  He had a fight on a soccer field, people from the pool, the entire town.  If you go to have dinner, the waiters, the freaking, the church, you go to church, and they're like, I believe in Jesus, but Jesus would hate this son of a bitch.  Everybody had a story of how they cannot stomach this individual.  And the minute I started hearing how, even the place where I go get gas, they go, let me tell you, this bastard did, I mean, I'm, my feelings are kind to him compared to what the entire town feels about this man. 
[03:18:00]  And they don't even know he's deadbeat.  They don't even know that he's deadbeat.  And he was driving around in a white Mercedes while he's not paying his children anything.  So it's like he's, but anyway, like I said, it's often, I don't care anymore.  Or whatever.  He's got the whole town to deal with.  I'm the least of his concern.  I want to go to your town and get a pizza man sighting.  Dude. 
[03:18:30]  Now I feel like I need to see him.  Do you want to come this week?  He's like a celebrity.  He'd be a celebrity.  You come this week?  Yeah.  He'd be a celebrity.  You come this week.  Go see, and I'll tell you what, you know what kids start doing?  I shouldn't say this, but I should say it off the air.  I guess I have that story, because I was saying bag of rocks.  Yeah.  Often, as a present, little bags of rocks were left.  Oh, shit.  As little sightings.  It's taking on a life of its own, pizza man.  It's really sad, though.  All the guy has to do is just be a regular guy.  There you go.  Just be a nice regular guy. 
[03:19:00]  Stop being a dick.  Stop being a dick.  You're a dick.  Stop being a dick.  How hard is that?  Just don't be a dick.  What an amazing advice, though.  Just stop being a dick.  Stop being a dick.  That's all it is.  That's what it comes down to.  And you know what?  Again, I was probably his only ally he had.  Like, I would still...  You guys started as sort of friends.  Although he pushed his way into your...  No, he pushed his way into my life.  Yeah.  But even then, I understood him.  He's off the ball.  He's a bag of rocks, all that jazz.  Bag of rocks.  I respected him, but he came after me.  And when he came after me, all bets are off. 
[03:19:30]  Especially when he went after my wife.  And like, are you a sick individual?  Now all bets are off.  And a lot of people out there are a little confused.  You've got to check out the original clip.  You've got to...  When Jim Brewer came in.  It's in four parts on YouTube.  You have to look at it.  It's an amazing story.  They have pizza man parties in my town.  I'm not even kidding you.  My pool man.  The pool man came and he goes, you know, we're going to Atlantic City and we're having a pizza man party.  I swear to God.  They go and have pizza man parties.  They watch the YouTube piece and they drink and they hang out and they laugh at pizza man. 
[03:20:00]  Isn't that hilarious?  Can you imagine a whole town just...  Just like that.  Awesome.  Just because you're a dick.  What was the other thing that you wanted to talk about?  Going into break.  I forgot.  Oh, we went into this whole...  Huh?  James Hetfield.  Oh, the Hetfield...  Yes.  While my wife...  Okay.  You would appreciate it.  Jimmy's going to love this story.  While my wife was first dipping into that world...  Born again.  Yes.  Even though you don't like that term? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  It's like you were always there.  The Christian lifestyle.  So I don't get that...  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You know.  Whatever.  So while that was going down, she would go to these things called Bible studies, which...  They're...  They're more like...  They're more like hanging out talks.  To be honest with you.  So it's very therapeutic.  They'll say like, today we're going to study what?  Should women listen to this...  Whatever the scenarios.  They call it Bible studies.  Well, this one woman was the head of the Bible study. 
[03:21:00]  And she was like in her 50s or whatever.  Nice lady.  Matter of fact, the best conversation I had was when she came over the house.  And she's like, my son...  I don't know what to do with him.  And I met the son.  He's a great guy.  And I said, well, you know, the more you try to shove this down his throat, he's not going  to...  You know, you got to go on his terms.  He's a different...  He's a...  You're a hippo and he's a wildebeest.  It's two different animals.  You eat different food.  But so long story short, you know, it's very biblical and all that. 
[03:21:30]  Well, I'm playing San Francisco.  While I'm in San Francisco, Mr. Hetfield is like, hey, you want to go to a car show?  So let's go to a car show.  How cool is that?  Very.  That's cool, right, Jim?  Yes.  And I'm not even into cars.  I don't get it.  But like, let's go out, blah, blah, blah.  So he calls and I'll pick you up at eight o'clock, whatever.  It's like eight in the morning, seven in the morning.  Night before, I get a call from my wife.  Oh, my God.  We'll call her Bible Barbara. 
[03:22:00]  Bible Barbara is in the hotel right behind you.  And she'd love to hook up with her.  And I'm like, all right, I call her and they're nice people.  I like them a lot.  They said, we love to do breakfast with you.  I said, all right, but I'm going to a car show.  I just want to let you know what's going down.  Okay.  So we're sitting down.  How's D?  Life's good.  How's the kids?  Blah, blah, blah.  A little four-she's breakfast.  Thank God for everything.  So with that, we hear, and you can hear this thing coming from miles away on Fisherman's Wall. 
[03:22:30]  He pulls up.  He's like a cool, old, I'm not a car guy, like a Dukes of Hazzard, awesome.  The stick shift is a skull.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So he pulls up.  And James is very recognizable. 
[03:23:00]  Even if you don't know who he is, like, other people go, oh, my gosh, that guy has tattoos.  Yeah, he must be somebody.  Oh, my gosh, he's either really crazy or he's, you know.  So he sits down.  He kind of said, do you mind?  I'm just finishing breakfast.  He's like, no, dude.  He comes in, he sits down.  How's the kids?  Everyone's good.  With that, we're sitting down.  This is such a funny conversation, because I have Bible, Barbara, and her husband, and James. 
[03:23:30]  And we're sitting there, and they're like, so, you know, what do you do for me?  He's like, I'm a musician.  Oh, what do you do for me?  Sorry, I'm going to James.  I don't know.  What do you do?  And he's got to be polite about it, right?  Oh, my goodness.  He's so cool.  He's trying to downplay it.  I'm a musician.  He's 1,000% downplaying it.  Right, right.  For 25 years, I have been the lead singer of the biggest fucking rock band.  Oh, I'm a musician.  I play on the weekends with my friends. 
[03:24:00]  What do you do?  I'm the most famous person you'll ever meet.  We get booked for parties every once in a while, you know.  We all have real jobs during the week.  Right.  Jesus.  I'm a musician.  So he says, you know, I'm a musician.  And the guy goes, oh, you know, what do you play?  He goes, you know, I play like rhythm guitar and sing.  I do lead vocals.  Oh, okay.  The conversation goes, so, you know, James, he's like, well, you know, a couple months 
[03:24:30]  off and this and that.  And I'm working on that and this and that.  And he doesn't go into specific studio.  He doesn't say studio.  He just says, I'm off for a while.  It's really nice.  I get to spend time with my family and see my children, my wife, and get to do great things  for my family.  So they go, wow, that's so your band, your band must do pretty much make a nice living.  A nice living.  Because I heard you say you're he travels the fucking world. 
[03:25:00]  I heard you're because you just said you're off for a couple months.  So you must do pretty good.  He goes, yeah, we, you know, I do.  We do very good for ourselves.  Can I jump in for a second?  Knowing you, you're not letting anyone.  Letting us all play down.  Right.  He then, curious is now, he's like, you know, where'd you get that car?  Yeah, it's an expensive car.  He's like, I, uh, shop and I'm in the cars.  We're going to a car shop, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:25:30]  Got a place here.  And he goes, well, do you mind if I, he goes, are you a band or?  He goes, yeah, we're, we're in a band.  What kind of music you could play?  Hard rock, heavy metal.  Would I know the band?  I, I don't know.  It's, uh, we, we're called, James, he goes, we're called Metallica.  Barbara, Bible Barbara instantly goes, and she, she puts her hands together and she starts praying.  She goes, I prayed that my son wouldn't listen to you.  Oh no. 
[03:26:00]  So like, oh no, oh no, what do we get?  And James, he says, oh, calm, collected.  He goes, well, maybe if you knew the reasons why your son was listening to us, you wouldn't have to pray so much.  And I just went, I went, wow.  That's deep.  That was a cool, awesome, powerful statement.  Very just simple matter of fact, not confrontational.  He could have totally took the confrontational route right there. 
[03:26:30]  Because here she is totally, even though she's Bible, she's judging him a thousand percent.  Oh yeah.  She, she just put on the table, I prayed that my son would never listen to you.  And it's like Satan just was sitting in front of her.  Yeah.  And he just simply said, well, maybe if you knew the reasons why he was listening to us, you wouldn't have to pray so hard.  And that was kind of like, oh, and, but the husband was like, wow, that's, uh, that's pretty cool. 
[03:27:00]  Metallica.  I think I know that one song.  What's that one song?  From the, exit from the dock, exit dock.  I mean, I, I mean, I prayed too.  Yes.  I prayed too.  I love, uh, and so, oh, it's cool.  But I thought, I thought that was a very, uh, powerful, defining moment of these two worlds.  Different worlds.  Sitting down.  Could have totally gone confrontational.  And yet, he played the much better man. 
[03:27:30]  Did your wife get a kick out of that?  She must have loved it.  Everyone loved it.  But Barbara, she laughed.  Barbara the Bible lady.  It was hilarious.  Pizza man probably didn't like it.  Pizza man.  I don't like that band.  He talks about crazy things.  He talks about crazy things.  Stupid pizza man.  Pizza man.  Fucking brutal.  How was the car show?  The what?  The car show.  It was good.  The funniest part was, there was two things.  James almost got us killed.  Because on the way back, he wasn't paying attention. 
[03:28:00]  And we were blasting Halford.  And so we're blasting Halford going over the Golden Gate Bridge.  And, you know, I'm rocking out and he's rocking out.  And then we don't realize it's dead stop traffic in front of us.  Fuck.  And we're like, ah!  I'm like, James!  James!  Ah!  We missed the car by a quarter of an inch, screeching the brakes.  Almost got us killed.  And then, while we were at the car show, he had, you know, this whole stick shift.  And he went to, and the whole thing pulled off. 
[03:28:30]  So we were stuck at the car show for hours.  And thank God he had all these, like, everyone went out of their way like, oh, man, I can fix it.  I can fix it.  No problem.  And they ended up fixing it.  And it was cool, you know.  I'm not a huge car guy.  You don't want to be killed with James Hetfield because it's going to read Hetfield and local comedian.  Right.  Hetfield and local comic visiting.  Perished today.  We got a guy that's claiming to be a business partner with Barbara's, Bible Barbara, whatever. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Husband there.  Okay.  God, all the locals are calling in for you today, Jim.  Eric in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, Jim.  How are you doing?  Good, Eric.  How are you?  Good.  I assume Barbara Bible's husband is Paul.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm his business partner.  I actually just called his son to let him know.  I think you were talking about his mother.  I've heard the story of when he met you in Hetfield.  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  It was.  It was.  You guys.  Yes.  It was the.  It was such a moment where I got like, oh, my God.  Where's this going to go?  And if anyone had this film, it just, it just, you couldn't have written a better film piece.  And it just ended so peacefully, calm, collective, and with such thought by the time it was over.  It was very cool.  And I've also asked them if they know what you do for a living and have ever heard you, and they have never heard one of your skits. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, I know, because I've been over to the house, and they haven't, you know.  Well, I'm sure Bruce appreciates you saying that, Eric.  Well, I don't understand.  Well, what do you mean?  Well, I would love for you to play a skit for them.  Like what particular skit?  Oh, nothing.  I always rave about your neighborhood with the bully.  Give me the bat.  Give me the bat.  Give me the bat.  Save my ups?  Yeah.  Save my ups. 
[03:30:30]  Save my ups.  Why don't you play a bit for those guys?  Yeah.  Well, let me ask you something.  Let me ask something.  What's his name?  Chip.  Eric.  Eric.  Eric, are you saying it in a, in a, um.  No, I think they'd enjoy you.  Oh.  Then play it.  Play it for them.  Yes, then play it for them.  What do you want?  I think they would like to, yeah.  Push play?  I think they would like more of the newer stuff, although that stuff's just as powerful and  just as funny.  Turn them on to Satan.  Okay.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  I'll turn them on to you. 
[03:31:00]  Thanks, guys.  Have a good one.  See, I didn't know if that was a, and I, there was a little underlying thing there.  Absolutely, there was.  A hundred percent.  That's what I was trying to get.  I was trying to get to that.  And hence, there goes that whole, I'm Christian thing.  Because you're not Christian.  Because if you truly, first of all, anytime you say you're Christian, you're automatically  judging anyone who's not.  Yeah.  So the minute you say, I'm Christian, you know, if you want to get into the logistics, if  there was a Christ and if there was a whatever, that guy would have never acted the way anyone 
[03:31:30]  acts today.  He lived by example if he existed.  He wouldn't go, um, maybe you should play one or your other.  You just played yourself.  And that's why I'll spend any time with anyone that lays the truth on their shoulder rather  than some phony bullshit person like you that claims they're, quote, Christian.  Christian, you are the reason that makes people walk away from God, faggot. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  Brewerspiration.  It's true.  Those are the people that ruin it for everyone.  You think that guy wasn't being straight up about it?  No, he was being a dick.  A hundred percent.  It was some underlying.  It was an underlying thing.  Maybe he should listen to your old, your old bit.  It was funny.  Yeah, of course it was.  You knew that his kids never heard of you.  Yeah.  Oh, his kids?  No, no, no, no.  He was talking about Paul.  He was talking about Paul.  And I'm sure Paul has. 
[03:32:30]  As a matter of fact, Paul has been kind enough to trust me to give one of his nephews advice  where I've talked to his nephew so he knows all about me.  I respect Paul as a man.  I'm not sure I respect you for those last comments.  Yeah, look at this.  Paul, who he's talking about, is a great man.  I've had great conversations with him.  And he's, this is when I really, and again, I enjoyed both of them.  They have, you know, one of their nephews is like, you know, he's getting entertainment on shore. 
[03:33:00]  MTV is asking about the thing.  He goes, I don't know much, but I know you're in the world, Jim.  Can I trust you to talk to him?  I said, absolutely.  Have the call me.  And we had a lengthy conversation about what do you want, life?  Why are you doing it?  All that jazz.  So I still think Eric was coming from an underlying bullshit world where Paul and Barbara would have never done what he just did.  What do you think Eric's motive is?  He doesn't like you or he's jealous?  No, no, no, no. 
[03:33:30]  He's just pulling that, you're not very, if they knew about your old bits,  huh, maybe they wouldn't be so fond of you.  Is this a big...  That's what I got out of it.  Is this a big movement in your town?  It's a movement in a lot of suburbs.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of suburbs.  Thanks to Fox News, which is your best friend.  Really?  Yes.  What do they do?  They all watch Fox News.  Do they?  Every single one.  They all love Sarah Palin. 
[03:34:00]  They love her.  I don't think Fox News changes into that.  I think them being like that makes them like Fox News.  Because it's that religious conservative thing.  But it's not religious conservative.  It's a sales pitch.  The word conservative and religious is a sales pitch.  Conservatism and liberalism, it's a sales pitch to divide and conquer everybody.  It's a hoax on you.  It's a hoax on me.  It's just a bullshit agenda to keep you guys constantly debating. 
[03:34:30]  That is what split up the entire country in the Civil War.  You with us?  Are you with them?  You conservative?  You liberal?  So if you have a point of view, there is no more point of view.  That's the genius of all news channels.  There is no more point of view.  It's either whatever point of view you are, oh, so you're this.  Oh, so you're that.  And that is a dangerous country to live in when you speak your mind and you have to be lumped into either or. 
[03:35:00]  See, the thing is, I consider myself a conservative.  What is a conservative?  What is a conservative?  What is it?  By definition?  How would you define your conservative?  Define it to me.  I am for less government in my life, more kind of traditional values as far as treating people a certain way. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  But as far as things like abortion, I could give a shit if they pull them out by the fucking goddamn sausage links.  Pull them all out.  Who cares?  Gay marriage?  Don't care.  Go ahead.  Get married.  Doesn't matter to me at all.  But other things like, yeah, Second Amendment.  I'm very, very for the Second Amendment.  What's the Second Amendment?  Guns.  I love guns from my cold dead hair. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, I'm dead.  So.  Shit.  But that's what I'm saying.  Just because you're into guns and you think less government, you're automatically conservative.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.  It is, it is.  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  I'm not saying you're dumb.  Oh, you can say that.  You can.  It's accurate.  You can, yeah.  But that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my entire lifetime. 
[03:36:30]  That's so stupid.  And again, let me ask you this.  Well, you called yourself more of a liberal thinker earlier.  I'm not a liberal.  Who said that?  I never said that.  Who said that?  Well, maybe you said more open-minded.  You just put words in my mind.  No, you said something like, it was about diversity or something.  Diversity.  No, you said you were more open-minded.  Open-minded.  I'm open-minded.  I'm a back porch talker.  That's all I am.  I'm a back porch talker.  That's it.  That's not...  I'm not liberal. 
[03:37:00]  I'm not conservative.  I'm a batch.  You don't think you would fit into any one of the categories that are out there?  Libertarian.  No.  Conservative.  No.  Why?  They're purposely put...  Left-leaning conservative.  Right-leaning liberal.  They're purposely put to divide and conquer.  Trust me.  Yeah.  You're purposely put to divide...  Let me ask you something.  Let me ask you a simple question.  I think you're a communist.  You never know.  You never know.  You goddamn communist heathen!  But let me ask you something.  This is the dumbest thing ever. 
[03:37:30]  And it...  Trust me.  My dad...  I don't think he's getting all that nonsense.  If there was no news, there would probably not even be voting.  Because you take in a town...  Any vote can be rigged.  A thousand percent.  No matter what anyone...  We're the greatest country...  All right.  Well, you think that way.  That's fine.  We're great and I wouldn't leave it and I'd get all that nonsense. 
[03:38:00]  But when it comes to voting, a thousand percent, everything's rigged.  Prove me wrong.  Prove me wrong.  You'll never be able to prove right.  But it'd be impossible to prove that fact wrong.  I'll give you a small, small scenario.  My town just had a mayor race.  We were running for mayor.  Whatever that means.  Town of Chester.  Pizza man didn't win.  Right?  No.  Oh, okay.  Scared me.  And I'll start on a lower level. 
[03:38:30]  A level that Jimmy will get with me.  It's battle the comedians.  Let's be honest.  Who's going to win that night?  I'll tell you who's going to win.  The guy who brings the most people.  Oh, right, right.  Not the funniest guy.  Not the guy that had the smartest material.  The guy that packed the house just so he can win.  The guy with the majority.  Correct.  And how do you get the majority?  Only because, oh, I will. 
[03:39:00]  I'm the, and if I win, and we're going to, it doesn't matter what his morals are.  It doesn't matter what he stands for.  It doesn't matter how funny or clever.  It's just, oh, this is what we believe in.  And we're, we're, yeah.  So they, yeah, we vote for you.  They never took the time to go, well, this was bullshit.  This was bullshit.  Well, you won, but, you know, fuck you.  We won.  It's all about you won.  Why the fuck you win?  Because you've got an ego the size of an elephant's balls, and that's your problem. 
[03:39:30]  So with that, in a town, let's take a town.  The guy up the street from me had, great guy, great neighbor.  You guys would love him.  On his lawn, he had one of those things that say, you know, Jerry for mayor.  Oh, vote for, yeah, yeah.  Okay?  I never got what that was.  I didn't know if you'd pay for it or whatever.  So I'm driving down.  I'm like, oh, I know Jerry.  Yeah, you know, he's got a couple kids.  I hope Jerry wins.  I hope he becomes mayor.  That'd be cool.  I don't know what that consists of, but whatever. 
[03:40:00]  Good for Jerry.  A week later, he's got Bob on his lawn.  And I'm thinking, huh, I guess you pay to have that, and maybe I should look into it  since maybe I'm worth a little more being the goat man or whatever.  And maybe, hey, pay me, and I'll make a couple hundred bucks to go on my lawn.  I eventually go to my neighbor, and I go, hey, man, what, I saw you had Jerry's, he's, 
[03:40:30]  I love Jerry, love Jerry, hope he wins.  I go, but you have Bob up there now.  He goes, yeah, because I need permits.  I go, what are you talking about?  He goes, I do construction, and I do carpentry.  And when I went to the town to get permits, they blatantly, and everyone knows our town.  Everyone knows what I'm talking about.  They said, well, if you take that sign off your lawn and another one shows up, I think  the permits will show up a lot quicker. 
[03:41:00]  Now, if that happens in this town, you'd be a full-blown rear-end jackass.  If you don't believe for one second, that doesn't happen in the ultimate battle of all,  which is the White House.  Oh, yeah.  So it's a full-blown bullshit scam.  And I'm not saying I'm from one side or the other.  I'm saying people should think more before they join the gay group.  I'm a red state. 
[03:41:30]  I'm a blue state.  I'm a conservative.  I'm a liberal.  You don't know what you are because they seamlessly divided and conquered you.  If you didn't watch any news, you wouldn't have anything.  Because watch any news.  This is what they do.  So today we're talking about abortion.  Now, this side believes blah, blah, blah, and this side believes blah, blah, blah.  Who do you stand for?  They don't give you an ounce to think. 
[03:42:00]  The minute you talk, well, then you're this and you're that.  No.  You're judging me and you're telling me.  Let's take a newspaper.  Look at this.  Here.  We'll attack USA.  Loss.  Everything in here is a fucking judgment.  It's a war.  It's a war.  Plead guilty.  Terror plot.  Vows to attack USA.  Son of a bitch.  I hope the bastard will good.  Everything in a headline already tells you how to think. 
[03:42:30]  Every single headline.  And whether you say, I'm smart enough to, I'm educated, and I'll tell you this right now,  I can decipher what the article says.  Well, unfortunately, half the population just looked at the headline.  Yeah.  And they didn't take the time to read the rest of the bullshit.  All they saw was, so-and-so's an animal.  And they walk around like, you know, so-and-so's an animal. 
[03:43:00]  And yeah, so-and-so's going to kill us.  So-and-so's an animal.  Well, if you read the article, well, I didn't have time to read it.  So it's all such.  Here, let's take voting.  Eight cans of, here's eight cans of, nine cans of soda.  All right?  Vote.  Who's better?  Pepsi or Coke?  Six of the nine people voted for Pepsi.  You know who wins?  Coke.  Because they're worth more.  And that is not a democracy. 
[03:43:30]  We claim to be a democracy.  That's not a democracy.  I believe Coke would win.  That's a full.  Coke is much better.  And that's a full-blown scam.  But I mean, Coke would win, honestly, I think.  But why do we step over that?  Well, it's been that way forever.  Well, then, let's go back to being fucking monkeys.  Let's have slavery back, if that's the way.  Oh.  So do you know what I mean?  All right.  That perked you up.  But does that make sense?  How can you say you're a democracy if out of seven people voted Coke, three voted Pepsi? 
[03:44:00]  Pepsi wins because they're worth more.  But where's an example?  Like, if that was the case, you're correct.  It is correct.  But where's an example?  Why are certain states worth more?  That makes no fucking sense if you're a democracy.  Zero.  Oh, you mean the way the electric college is?  Yeah.  And so what is everyone's, well, it's been that way.  Well, we have to change it.  They just push you up every four years because you're fucking retarded.  Well, we're looking to change it out next time.  You guys just go and vote.  There's no voting.  They take polls. 
[03:44:30]  Why?  They take polls every month.  That's to see, you know, apparently the people are very upset with George Bush.  The Bulls say if the Negro don't win, there may be lots of riots, so he won.  It's such, I dare you not to watch news anymore.  I dare anyone and watch when the common sense sets in.  They don't want you talking.  They don't want you hanging out.  They want you divided so they can conquer you and keep you in order.  I don't, I think you're giving them too much credit.  I think that Fox, CNN, it's their businesses. 
[03:45:00]  They're just guys, the same guy that works for CNN would quit tomorrow and take more money  at Fox.  They've done it.  It's like, I don't, I don't think, I don't give them that much credit.  Yeah, but who, you're talking about guys that read, you're giving them too much credit  because you're talking about guys that just read the fucking panel.  Who's typing for them to read the panel?  Who's, who, today, uh, you know, do you think all these big top reports, they're  not reporters. 
[03:45:30]  They're told, you need to go here.  This is going to make us look, they're pawns for the gorilla.  And the gorilla says, you're going to go to Haiti and you're going to look huge.  And, and he sits there and he reads the monitor.  You know, here we are.  He ain't talking.  Cause if he was talking, he'd go, holy shit.  It smells like fucking death, dude.  Over there, there's boils coming off this kid.  Oh my God.  I can't even.  Here, get the camera.  I'm fucking dry even. 
[03:46:00]  It smells, it's fucked up, man.  You guys, that's reporting.  That's like street reporting.  The shit they do trains you to emotionally detach yourself from everything, to numb you.  Just like the fucking Nazis did with, yeah, don't look here.  Don't look there.  Just dead Jews all over.  It's all good.  Same thing here.  Whether it's someone murdered, whether it's a catastrophe, you just sit there and go, oh,  all right. 
[03:46:30]  Fuck that.  Don't you remember being a kid?  You saw a car accident and it was an event.  People from around the block like, oh shit.  There's steam coming out of the engine, dude.  He came around the corner and he didn't fucking see him.  This guy was like, meh, meh.  He hit him and he got out because his father's Puerto Rican.  He got out and he was like, your father's Puerto Rican.  I was like, oh shit.  He started fucking fighting and shit.  It was nuts.  And his mother came out.  That is the event for the summer because you're emotionally attached to what you saw.  All this shit is bullshit. 
[03:47:00]  These guys aren't reporters.  None of this news is, it's all bullshit.  So what do you do to get your info?  I turn it off.  What do you need the info for?  What do you need the info for?  Tell me.  You don't.  What do you need it for?  To just know what's going on.  Why?  I don't know.  I think you can make more informed decisions if you.  Really?  What kind of decision are you making?  For what?  For the way I live my life.  For where I live.  For the way, if I'm comfortable paying taxes, I'm comfortable voting for certain people, 
[03:47:30]  which I don't vote.  But you know what I mean.  No, I know what you mean.  And also on stage, as a comic, you talk about what's going on in the world.  As a comedian, I sort of get it.  But when it comes to the way you live your life, the way your taxes, what?  What are you talking about?  What are you going to go riot if they raise your taxes?  What are you going to go start picketing?  What are you talking about?  And I'm just saying, what are you talking about?  Because I hear that a lot.  No one can ever bet.  Well, it's the way I live.  I want to know what's going on in Africa. 
[03:48:00]  Why?  A part of it is human curiosity, too.  You want to know what's going on in the world.  That's like saying, why do we explore space?  Who gives a shit?  I mean, it's the same thing.  To say that I watch Fox or I watch CNN and they tell me how to feel is one thing.  But to actually want to know what's going on in the world, there's nothing ignorant about  wanting to know what's going on in the world.  I get that.  To a degree.  To a degree.  But the minute it never ends there, it always turns into some years.  How about nature shows?  Don't you love nature shows?  Love nature shows. 
[03:48:30]  It's the same thing.  Just a different bit of information.  You want to know what's going on in nature.  But the minute you start debating it is when it gets silly.  The minute you start debating going, that's the difference.  Nature, I know how a wildebeest lives.  I know how a lion lives.  When you start telling me, the people of Akronistan are pure evil.  Have you grown up there?  No.  Have you spent a month there?  No.  So don't tell me who the fuck is evil.  Don't tell me this child's an asshole. 
[03:49:00]  Well, maybe his father died.  And maybe he's having emotional problems.  That's why he's starting to do drugs and shit.  He's not an asshole.  So it's all built on false perceptions to make you think and judge.  And the whole thing is based on, so you won't think.  I'll think for you.  And whether you think you can decipher that is another genius method that they put into you.  You can decipher it.  Really? 
[03:49:30]  I'd like to challenge that thought process.  Anybody that allows the news to make their decisions for them.  Or if you will.  Everyone does.  I don't.  Go in any coffee shop.  Any coffee shop across the country.  I guarantee you, people are talking about and debating only what they heard on their news channels.  That's it.  Well, there's a certain amount of information you get, whether it's accurate or not.  But I mean, it's like we don't spend time in Zimbabwe.  We don't spend time in Zimbabwe.  So that means...  So you only get one perspective.  That's like saying, look. 
[03:50:00]  Here, I'll give you an example.  But how do you find out about those places then?  You go there.  And if you don't want to go there, then you don't sit and listen to one bullshit side.  It's almost like a fight.  Always remember this.  No matter what the conversation, there's always two sides.  There's three sides.  There's their side.  Your side.  And then the truth.  And people are getting...  I do it with my kids.  Do it with my fucking kids.  She hit me and said I was a stupid poopy face. 
[03:50:30]  Now, I can either get emotionally involved and go, you hit Gordie.  Or I go, now, hold on a second.  Every action causes a reaction.  Why did she hit you?  Why did she call you a poopy face?  Well, because I don't know why.  I need to hear the other side.  Hold on a second.  Something went on, yeah.  She took my shit and she threw it in the sewer so it pissed me off. 
[03:51:00]  And she said, bite my ass.  So I hit her and called...  Oh.  See, but the news only gave me the side of the one person.  And now everyone in the house wants to kill the one person.  Unfortunately, they never heard the other person.  When you were talking about Wildwood and you said there were some problems,  immediately I said, what weekend?  I made a judgment and I knew...  But did the news tell you that?  No. 
[03:51:30]  You learned by experience.  Never been there during that weekend.  You just heard.  Heard.  Honestly.  Have heard enough from different sources.  Sure.  Eh.  Sure.  Certain judgments are very ignorant.  Yes.  And certain judgments you'd be...  But there are certain judgments that it's almost like when an act of terrorism happens.  Like, if it's in Ireland, you immediately know.  Sure.  All right.  Yeah.  Yes.  If it happens here, you immediately...  You don't think, wow, the Jews blew something up.  You kind of know.  Right.  Eh.  Sure.  And yes, the news has told us that.  Sure.  But it's like, how else do we come to any conclusion with every source of information 
[03:52:00]  that we have available to us?  Maybe you're right.  Like, if we had the ability to go every single place and face...  Then maybe our news would be different, but to me, if you only watch Fox, or if you only  watch CNN...  CNN or whoever, NBC, blah, blah, blah.  But if you...  There's enough information out there now between whether it's the Fox or the Judge Report or  the Huffington Post or CNN, there's enough different viewpoints where I think you get  some kind of a complete picture.  Yeah.  Fucking NPR.  There's a million ways to get information. 
[03:52:30]  Who has that time?  Well, it's like...  Does the average human have that time?  No, but if they have the time to go to places...  That's true, though.  Yeah.  So, anyway, at the end of the day, all I'm saying is, I don't get into all that nonsense.  Yeah.  At the end of the day, I really...  I don't get into papers.  I don't get into news.  At the end of the day, I just got...  You got your core friends.  You're in Brewer's little circle.  Brewer's little circle.  It's a good circle.  It's a little circle world.  It's a great circle.  Makes life easier, right?  It's a great circle.  You don't have to worry about anything outside that circle. 
[03:53:00]  Why?  Hey, the biggest story.  Why?  Why, Father?  Until it's coming down in your neighborhood, just like tribes.  Did they have...  Were tribes going, what are you saying is 5,000 miles away?  There are people being tortured.  Well, let's try to make canoes and boats and go...  No!  You got problems in your little circle.  Take care of those problems.  And when those meatheads come over here, then we'll deal with the situation.  Brewer, what's your take on 9-11? 
[03:53:30]  I don't want to go there.  You don't want to go there today?  I really don't want to go there.  It's exhausting.  That one is a girl thing.  You want to know the truth is?  I don't know what the take is, but I'm not believing anything that's put in front of me.  Because at the end of the day, no one knows anything.  No one knows anything.  I ask that because everything you were saying in the last 20 minutes, it's...  You know what I mean?  You could be referring to 9-11 at night.  No, I'm referring to life as general.  Yeah.  Just in general.  Whether it's today...  What I'm saying is like one story is on TV and people just buy into that story. 
[03:54:00]  They just buy it.  No matter what.  Without actually...  No matter what.  Without even thinking, that's what happened.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to sit and wait and...  Just about...  It didn't look like the plane hit.  I mean, the things that a lot of the conspiracy guys raise were interesting questions, and I  didn't know enough to just go, ah, they're idiots.  So we got them on and talked to them.  And by listening to them talk...  A bunch of the guys who were very involved with the conspiracies were pretty heavily involved  with the conspiracy theories and that were, you know, on the websites and all that stuff. 
[03:54:30]  Not the gatekeepers like you, man.  But I mean, I really...  That's why they drove me nuts.  Because I was like, I'm the one that wanted you on, you assholes.  Like, I...  What would they say?  What would they say?  I don't even know.  Just that the whole thing was, you know, it was a government thing, or it was not what  we said, or it was a rocket fire.  And then I just would watch clips of people who had seen things coming in.  Sure.  And we had a cop call in and go, I was there.  I saw the building fall, asshole. 
[03:55:00]  And I believed the guy.  I didn't believe the guy on the phone.  I believed the cop who called it.  Like, it was just through kind of listening...  The cop from Wildwood?  No, yeah.  That guy said he just walked away.  He's like, I was a basic human...  The Wildwood cop who had enough...  Basic human nature.  But you know what I mean?  Yeah, I just believed one side over the other, but I did listen to both sides.  And we talked to a lot of those conspiracy guys.  They confronted us in the street, we talked to them, and I found most of them to be agenda  driven.  Of course.  Completely agenda driven.  And it just didn't... 
[03:55:30]  But what is their agenda?  What's their agenda?  Their agenda is proving...  Is marrying themselves somehow intellectually to what happened and solving it.  To an event, yeah.  To it being different than they were told.  And there are times when things are different than they were told.  They're just mad, like, I am not going to listen to that.  It's an odd rebellion, and it's an odd...  Mom and dad, yeah, but it's an odd way of feeling safe, too.  Because to say the government did it...  Yeah.  ...still somehow says we're in control.  It's a lot less scary than going, we got fucked hard and we couldn't stop it. 
[03:56:00]  That's a scarier prospect to a lot of people and they don't even know it.  Well, I am shocked that...  If we got fucked hard...  Like, the part that I'm confused is...  I'm confused where, right after it all went down, right...  One of the most frightening...  More frightening time for me was when that sniper was plucking people.  Oh, fucking John Muhammad and Lee Malmo. 
[03:56:30]  He was plucking innocent people.  And that was by far the most frightening time I've ever lived as a child.  Even more frightening than the towers.  Because the towers...  I could see, like, all right, they're going after the country or government, whatever.  This was...  I'm just going to fucking pluck whoever I feel like plucking today.  Whether it's a child, a mother, a father, some poor schlep that had to go pick up some fucking wood for his wife. 
[03:57:00]  He's just getting plopped at that.  So, what I don't understand is...  And this is...  These are just questions.  I'm not saying...  These guys...  The government...  What I don't understand is...  What is their...  What is the bad guy's agenda?  If the bad guy's agenda is to...  Us.  Why would you just stop at the towers?  If you want to crush a fucker, they can easily do it. 
[03:57:30]  As much as we want to say we can't...  They can't...  Of course they can.  They could have done exactly what that guy...  First day is the towers.  The next day, we're blowing up ten fucking oil rigs.  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  You would have this place in chaos.  Whether you think it or not.  Chaos.  You get ten snipers.  Strategically across the country.  And they know they're going to die.  But before they die, they get the whole place going... 
[03:58:00]  What the fuck is going on?  I'm afraid to go get water.  I don't know where the fuck these people are.  Cops.  Everyone's on.  Holy shit alert.  Is that easy to plan that many events to happen in a certain timeline?  If you're genius enough to plan a five-year event where I got to train you to fly a fucking  plane, somewhere along the line, I'd be a little worried that maybe Ahmed will go, 
[03:58:30]  you know, now that I fly a plane, I don't know why I have to kill myself.  Jesus Christ.  I can fly to another fucking country and enjoy life.  And I don't know why I made him Indian.  Yeah, why not?  But you know what I mean?  Like, and I'm not saying that's what happened.  I don't understand.  All right.  Let's say he's brainwashed.  Somewhere, all of them, not one went, fuck this.  I can fly a plane.  I ain't going to fucking fly no towers.  I ain't going to kill these fuck...  That's your only plan? 
[03:59:00]  If you're that genius, because to me, that's genius.  Call him stupid.  To me, that's genius.  That's some Japanese bomber shit.  They're just religious fanatics.  That's all.  It's the same as 15th century...  Why do you say that?  Do you know that?  Why would you say that?  Because they say they're behind it for Islam, and they think...  Who said that?  Bin Laden and...  Bin Laden hasn't been mentioned since the day it happened.  Is he the criminal, or is he not the criminal?  And Al-Zawahari, they all say that they were doing it for Islam, and they think it's...  Hold on a second. 
[03:59:30]  Hold on a second.  They think it's...  We're getting too far.  We're getting too far.  So, let's stick to what I was saying before.  The genius plan is to train everyone to come and get you, and then you just stop right  there.  There's no other genius.  Knowing, you're probably going to come over here and come get us.  Well, don't forget...  I'm just confused by it.  I'm not saying it's right or wrong.  That confuses me.  My take on that is...  That's weird to me.  Most of the stuff is probably easier to conduct overseas.  Most of these operations are easier to conduct overseas than they are here. 
[04:00:00]  I think our intelligence is better than a lot of them.  It's so good that they infiltrated airplanes.  I'm not...  No, no.  I'm not saying it's impossible.  That's how genius it is.  Don't forget, they didn't infiltrate the airplanes.  Pilot training told them to open doors and negotiate.  I mean, it was...  If the pilots did not open those doors, not one of those attacks would have worked.  Jimmy, let me say something to you.  I want to take down your whole radio show, okay?  You're telling me, and I'm just asking you to think about this. 
[04:00:30]  If I now know, oh my God, these fucking retards are so dumb that I'm training on their land.  Let's take...  Let's not take this.  Let's take it a couple steps further.  Because this is just going to be a minute scale.  Day one is this.  Day two is this.  Everything else is easier.  The hardest thing is flying into planes.  They could have planted suicide bombers all over the place.  They could have...  I agree.  They could have planted snipers.  They could have planned whatever.  And if you doubt for one second that they would never do that, that's why I question you. 
[04:01:00]  I just have questions.  How can you be that smart to put a long-term plan together and that's it?  You're just done?  And once I know I can infiltrate you, I'm going to bury you.  By the way, an opinion is they did try in 93 to take the towers down.  It didn't work.  Why haven't they done suicide bombers all over?  I've wondered that too.  Why not walk into a Macy's at Christmastime, Christmas rush and start blowing up exits? 
[04:01:30]  I'm guessing...  Because it might start World War III, maybe.  Because the visual of that event got the whole world looking.  Like, how do you get...  The whole world wouldn't look at just snipers, even though it's kind of frightening.  But the idea of that happening, I think, to them, was more effective.  Let me ask you this then.  There's another...  And that's something I just thought about.  Non-news, just thought about.  Basic life.  Let's see my block.  My block, Pizza Man.  Pizza Man hates me. 
[04:02:00]  So he comes over, blows up my garage.  Now, everyone says it's Pizza Man.  But for some reason, I go and fuck his neighbor up.  I'm like...  And everyone's like, why are you fucking the...  The whole neighborhood goes, oh, shit.  We got your back.  The whole neighborhood says, that bastard.  How dare he?  We will do anything we can.  And I don't go after Pizza Man.  And I go and fuck the neighbor up. 
[04:02:30]  And everyone goes, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Why are you fucking...  Well, because the neighbor had a barbecue with him.  Six...  Don't worry about why I'm fucking with the neighbor.  And then the whole block that was behind me, now the whole block is going, you're a fucking asshole.  And I take the approach of, no, the whole block's an asshole.  No, you guys are all assholes.  I'm going to do it.  My fucking garage got blown up.  Yet, the whole block is going, retard. 
[04:03:00]  You should really fucking just listen to some things we have to say.  And I go, fuck you.  I'm going to blow up the neighbor and everything else.  Wouldn't you resent it if you had been protecting the rest of that block for all these years and helping them out?  And you knew a lot of the reason that the rest of the block didn't want to get involved is because they had certain dealings.  Yes.  And they had certain dealings with the guy that blew your garage up and that they weren't really saying he was innocent.  They just wanted to continue.  You know, it's like there's a whole bunch of stuff.  It goes deep and dark and ugly and it never ends and all that.  And again, so at the end of the day, my whole point is, what's my take? 
[04:03:30]  Nobody knows what the fucking take is.  Nobody.  As much as you say, it's this, it's that, it's that, it's bang, it started in 1950, it started in 1960, it's the Bush, it's the, it's been laden.  And no one knows what the fuck it is.  Nobody.  It's, uh, it's, uh, the guy in Iraq who we killed and our mission was to kill.  Well, he's dead now, but we're still there and we're going to build.  What?  What?  What? 
[04:04:00]  What are you?  Well, we got, uh, the world and, you know, we're sad and the terrorists are all in a Mexican.  What?  I don't fucking get it.  Based, based, based on some of the stuff that you do here and, and just human nature.  Uh, I think you can kind of make some decisions though, uh, and, and have them fairly educated.  You know, uh, news is one thing when they tell you stuff, but you just knowing what human beings are like.  Yeah. 
[04:04:30]  At the type of animals we are, you could kind of, especially where you grew up, you know,  and what you're saying before about, yeah, uh, Al Qaeda.  Why didn't they just fucking keep going?  I don't get this concerted, um, long-term plan.  It's, it's like anything else.  It's people and resources and time.  Why didn't Japan just steam to fucking California after Pearl Harbor?  They had it wide open.  Because we went after them.  But they had it wide open.  We didn't go after them for a couple of months after, uh, Pearl Harbor.  They, they, they destroyed the fleet and they turned around, went back to Japan. 
[04:05:00]  They could have come right to California and fucking blown up LA and San Diego if they wanted to.  But they didn't because it's time, more planning, all the planning that went into just the Pearl Harbor invasion.  They couldn't then go, all right, then now after we do this gigantic surprise attack, let's do this and this also.  You're just concentrating on the one big motherfucker thing because it is a big motherfucker thing.  Anthony, I would, I would understand that if we weren't in 2010 and we have the most powerful weapons in the world. 
[04:05:30]  Back then, Japan had no clue what we were going to fucking do.  They had no clue in a couple months.  It was, take that motherfucker!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Incendiary bombs on Tokyo.  Now, the world knows these guys can stand behind a computer and go,  the whole neighborhood gone. 
[04:06:00]  So that's why I question, I get what you're saying.  And I, it's a great fucking thought process.  Like I think about, but at the same time, I know what the consequences are.  Back then, they didn't know what the consequences are.  They were just like, America, they're in a depression.  They got no money to make a weapon for Britain.  They got nothing.  Exactly, it's going to fucking bomb now.  Where's your, what, are you going to swim to us?  They're fucking crippled, we're building shit. 
[04:06:30]  They're done, they fucking got no money.  They got nothing.  Germany's coming, they're going to make a deal with the Mexicans.  They're done.  They didn't expect this.  This is a different beast.  This, we could have turned around and just went, oh really?  To me, that would have been a bigger, if I knew exactly who fucking did this.  Exactly who did this.  You want to make a statement? 
[04:07:00]  And this is why I question, is it, is it business deals?  Is it this?  Is it, you want to make a, you want to make a statement?  Fried potato.  Well, if I knew it was Bin Laden, and I knew, I say, you got, I'm not even going to tell  the world what's going on.  And that's another thing, we told the world what was going down, I have problems with that.  I have a lot of problems with that.  That's like me saying, I'm going to Pizza Man, I'm going to beat the shit out of him.  Why would I be that stupid?  I'm just going to beat the fucking shit out of him in the middle of the night when no 
[04:07:30]  one, and they go, who did that?  I don't know, maybe we should think about that, who blew up my garage.  And then the whole world would go, oh shit.  If Pizza Man is in one of your friend's houses and the door's locked and you kick the door  without telling your friend.  I'll say you got one day to get him out, I'm going to fry potato you.  That's what it is.  One day.  It's very hard for us to just fly into Pakistan or Afghanistan.  Really?  Why is it so hard?  They're fucking the size of Vermont.  You got one day, I'm telling the whole world, you got one fucking day, get that fuck out 
[04:08:00]  of the house.  You're putting in jeopardy your family's lives.  I like that.  And his family's lives.  That's exactly what the U.S. did.  That makes sense.  You're right.  That's what the U.S. did with Afghanistan.  They told the Taliban, hand him over.  The Taliban said, no, we're not handing him over.  He's a fried potato.  We're protecting him.  Why are we still there?  I'm just saying that was the thinking of the U.S.  Omar would not give him up.  But then why are we still there?  Because they have not been able to get him.  Fried potato.  You mean blow the whole thing up? 
[04:08:30]  Fried potato.  Oh, well, you know.  You're not going to get an argument out of me, but I'm not practical.  The whole world would go, oh, okay, they're pissed.  They're pissed.  Just when you and I both know that what they're doing now, as much as blah, blah, blah, and  you're sending guys that are trained and they're leaving their families, they're putting  their lives on the line, they're leaving their children to fight someone they don't know who 
[04:09:00]  the fuck they're fighting?  Are you kidding me?  Have you not learned this lesson before?  We created this warfare.  We created this warfare where, like, we don't know who we're fighting.  Back in the Civil War, we created that shit when the dopey jackass Britons came over with  their red suits.  We went, yeah, put on a red hat.  It was a fucking, you know, I'm going to wear T-shirts.  I ain't dressing up for this shit.  Here, let us feed your family.  They fucking fell for it because we didn't wear the outfit. 
[04:09:30]  So you're over there.  You got one Afghanistan going, I know where, and you don't know if he's fucking.  Why fuck with that mentality?  Because we're not willing to do a fried potato.  That's what it is.  We're trying to be polite.  But you're willing to let our country take a hit like that?  Then I need to question who's willing.  If my child is viciously attacked like that, I ain't going to be nice.  I'm going to fucking rip your face to pieces. 
[04:10:00]  It's a politician's version of warfare these days.  Politicians, and we need to change politicians.  Hence, all the news.  Change, oh, the politician.  If this was any other country, they would have been out in the streets ripping shit down.  No, we need to really think about what's going on.  Really?  How they all do it, though.  When we can't bomb an enemy because they're too close to a mosque, to me, that'll just perpetuate everything.  I'm just sitting here watching the world go round and round. 
[04:10:30]  I really love to worry about your family, worry about your friends, get these poor bastards  that are sacrificing their lives and their children and their mothers, and just get them  home, have a huge party every time.  See, I like that idea.  I'm fine with that.  You know, when I listen to these, we support our troops.  No, you don't.  Because every day they come home, you'd have a full-blown parade.  Every single fucker that comes home, you should have a full-blown parade from the minute 
[04:11:00]  he gets off the fucking boat.  So don't give it a bullshit.  You know, all of them, they're such, they're lying to everybody.  And that's why I don't get involved, because no one gets it.  No one gets it.  No one gets, oh, oh, what we should do.  I saw something the other day.  I just heard a little, you know, in the past, where one of the politicians were like, when  I'm in, I'm going to support the troops. 
[04:11:30]  How about you support them now, retard?  Why do you have to wait until you're in?  What kind of stupid statement is that?  So then you just played yourself.  You just played yourself.  When you've got someone now who goes, I have advice for the president what to do.  You have advice?  How about you fucking save the situation, and that puts your, quote, politics and your  egotistical balls ahead of you, and you save the situation.  It's like saying, I just watched someone get hurt, and someone's on the floor scrambling. 
[04:12:00]  I can help them.  I'm going to go, if you give me credit, I will save this individual.  Well, then you're a scumbag.  And you're full of shit.  And that they are, because most of it is just getting re-elected.  Revolution calling!  Revolution calling!  I recommend Operation Mindcrime.  The next time you're here, I want to talk JFK conspiracy.  Oh, and it's all so exhausting.  Like, what are you going to do?  There's nothing you can do, man.  We're all just people.  Enjoy each other. 
[04:12:30]  Backyard talk.  Look after each other.  We don't have to love each other.  We should know each other.  Look after each other.  Have great barbecues, debates.  But once you start fighting over it, no one knows anything, though.  Here's the important thing.  I said way too much, Tim.  It was great, dude.  You're fucking phenomenal.  It was great watching it today, Jim.  We're running out of show.  It's 10 of 11?  Yeah, we're way past it.  Oh, my God.  I babbled for seven hours.  It's all good.  If you want to do Jim's closing.
