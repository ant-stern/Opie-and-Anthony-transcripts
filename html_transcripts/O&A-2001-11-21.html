<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion about "Getaway Day" before Thanksgiving, transitioning quickly to Anthony's explosive ragequit of the online game EverQuest, which he referred to as "EverCrack."  He detailed the frustration of failing to level up and the consequences of in-game death. This spurred a flurry of caller anecdotes about their own video game addictions, encompassing titles like Counter-Strike, Doom, Tomb Raider, and Grand Theft Auto 3.  Callers confessed to sleep deprivation, self-inflicted injuries from rage, and even a divorce stemming from excessive gaming.  The segment featured humorous accounts of gaming habits and their negative real-world impacts, interspersed with a comedic Stephen Lynch song about Dungeons & Dragons, a Sam Adams beer commercial, and a call from radio host Scorch promoting his "Marathon for Meals" stunt.  In-studio guests Jim Norton and Colin Quinn were present throughout this portion.  The hosts also teased and then delivered a segment called "Let the Lobster Loose," which played an old Steve Martin bit.

The conversation continued with Norton and Quinn, starting with lighthearted banter about Long Island geography and a joke about Hillary Clinton's sincerity.  This segued into a discussion about a past on-air incident involving ice cream, and a mention of their upcoming joint performance at Caroline's Comedy Club.  The hosts then introduced "the unlucky lottery," a segment showcasing incredibly improbable and unfortunate events, such as a man killed by a duck while jet skiing and a girl killed by a falling tombstone cross.  This sparked a discussion about God, punctuated by Colin Quinn spilling coffee on himself.

The show then featured a phone call from a purportedly live Ronald Reagan.  The call consisted of nonsensical ramblings, inaccurate historical recollections, and offensive insults directed at Nancy Reagan's appearance, specifically targeting her head size with vulgar language. The impersonator blended genuine Reagan quotes with fabricated statements, creating a chaotic and comedic segment filled with frequent interruptions, references to bodily functions, and further inappropriate jokes.  The call concluded abruptly.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let the party, let the party!  Let the party!  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  No, man, we are live, nationwide.  A lot of people, I see a lot of people took the day off, which is kind of weird.  The day before Thanksgiving, I don't know, they call it Getaway Day, Opie. 
[00:00:30]  Getaway Day.  The news always using their little catchphrases, today is Getaway Day.  I didn't mind it, I got a spot at the Brooklyn Diner for lunch today.  You did, did ya?  Restaurant's usually a nightmare today, no one's around, man.  How are you, my buddy?  I'm better than I was about five minutes ago.  Yeah, day before Thanksgiving, everyone's out on the highways already.  We gotta start the show by asking Anthony why he just completely destroyed his work area. 
[00:01:00]  I guess we could call it a work area.  It's not the traditional work area like you have in your office, but we consider it our work area,  which is a computer and computer games and various CDs that are stacked on the desk.  You completely destroyed your area.  I don't think your computer will be able, I don't think we'll be able to salvage it.  I lost my mind for a second.  I was nodding on, nice. 
[00:01:30]  I lost my effing mind.  As you know, I have an addiction.  It's a disease.  It's a disease.  You hear about people with their addictions to drugs and alcohol,  and they call it a disease, and they shouldn't blame the person because it's a disease.  I realize I have an addiction.  It is to the lame, geeky game EverQuest, which is also called EverCrack. 
[00:02:00]  But you're a normal guy.  But I'm a normal guy, and I realize it's a problem, and that's the first step is what I hear.  God, we're confessing a lot lately on this show.  So what happened was, you know, I've been having a lot of problems getting through some of these levels.  You start off at level one with your character.  It's an online game where you have to kill things and hunt things and quest for items to raise your level, 
[00:02:30]  which in turn raises your ability to fight future little creatures and whatnot.  So I've been trying to get from level 20 to level 21 with my shaman barbarian,  using my magical powers and my limited melee ability.  And I was about right before showtime, I was, I swear to you, I could have killed anything and leveled to 21.  Didn't matter what it was. 
[00:03:00]  As long as it wasn't green.  If it con blew, light blue, I could have killed it.  You were really close.  I was so close.  I think you've got to explain to the folks, when you don't go from 20 to level 21, what happens to you?  Now, if I would have killed anything, I would have leveled 21.  Congrats, you made it to 21.  But if you get killed, you go back and experience a lot further than just that little area that I would have needed to advance.  You know, if you kill something, you advance a little fraction.  If you die, you lose a lot more than you advance. 
[00:03:30]  And you've been stuck.  I've been stuck at 20.  For a long time.  For quite some time.  So, I was very close.  Right before showtime, I go, okay, you know something?  Instead of sitting and logging off and going in to do the show, I will level before showtime.  So, I went out with maybe a little less power than I should have went out with.  And I took on a creature and it killed me and set me back. 
[00:04:00]  Yes, I picked up various stuff from my desk and threw it at my monitor.  And things were breaking.  I wasn't sure.  You probably lost your ass.  I was very, very angry.  It was fun to watch your brain work.  Like, your wheels were spinning like Norton said.  Like, you could see that something really bad was going to happen.  Then you finally reached your breaking point.  Oh, God damn it. 
[00:04:30]  So, that's where I stand now.  And I wanted to do it because I know I'm going to be going out to Long Island tonight.  We got a gig at Sergeant Peppers.  And I knew I wasn't going to be out with Thanksgiving.  I'm not going to be online.  I'm not going to be able to get my fix for quite some time.  So, I figured I'd hit 21 here before the show.  Be very happy.  And I get killed.  So, I destroyed my monitor.  You destroyed everything, my friend.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I actually really got divorced because I have a question. 
[00:05:00]  I'm dead serious.  I'm dead serious.  I'm not even kidding.  Did it come up in court?  Actually, it didn't come up in court.  But it was a sit-on-the-computer playing online all night not paying attention to me.  Yeah.  And her lawyer had all this crap about how people's parents are suing Verrett because their kids are flunking out of college and all this.  And they made this big stinking deal out of it.  Yeah, I really got divorced because of it.  It kind of gets to you. 
[00:05:30]  I was terrible, though.  I mean, I had two 60th-level characters and one 54th.  I mean, I was really bad.  So, he must have been at it for quite some time.  Yeah, it takes a long time.  I've had a beta test in it, and it's terrible.  But now, I quit.  How many hours a day were you playing?  I was, well, me and my brother owned our own business.  So, we both played at work all day.  And then we'd go home.  I was playing probably 12, 14 hours a day.  12, 14 hours a day.  You see the new ad they're putting in some of the computer gaming magazines for EverQuest?  It shows a girl at a bar with a short skirt on and this guy talking to her. 
[00:06:00]  And she's going, thank you, EverQuest.  It's terrible.  Her boyfriend or husband or whatever it is is too busy playing.  She's out effing at the bar.  I was dying laughing looking at that.  I'm like, oh, that is sad, man.  I quit, and there's an even worse one out now.  So, Dark Ages of Camelot, it's even worse.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  Okay, J.T.  Well, good luck, man.  Thank you.  I know I'm a dork.  What can I tell you? 
[00:06:30]  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, man, I just wanted to tell Anthony to put that 20-sided dice down, man.  Oh, I'm not playing Dungeons and Dragons.  Online.  It sounds like it.  It's just on the computer.  I know.  Well, you know, it pretty much is, but that's funny, Mark.  Thank you.  No problem.  Take care, guys.  I wouldn't go as far as to play D&D.  It's an online game.  I mean, you know, I play other ones.  I play World War II online. 
[00:07:00]  I play Allegiance.  You know, there's plenty of online gaming.  I play all the Half-Life online games.  It's an addiction.  What can I tell you?  But you've met your match with EverQuest.  It's just such a pain in the ass.  So if anyone's on the Adrenal server, Adrenal server, I would like you to really give me  some good stuff so I can power through this level.  Opag, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Ann.  You know, you have a decision when you turn the power on the computer. 
[00:07:30]  It's using my logic.  You know, when you grab a cigarette and put it in your mouth, you know you're hurting  yourself and you want to quit.  I know.  What can I tell you?  So do you want help or not?  No.  I could do this myself.  But thank you.  Keep emailing me with ways I could get through it.  All right, bud.  Thanks, man.  Take it easy.  That's funny.  Jessica, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Do you need help with the Quest? 
[00:08:00]  Because there's a lot of places you can look for Quests.  I know about the Quests.  So there's this really great site, EverQuestSucks.com slash Quests, actually.  With a name like that, you wouldn't think of it, but...  Listen to this geeky girl.  I'm not a geeky girl.  Are you a hot geeky girl or just a geeky girl?  Yes.  Yeah?  The first part.  Hot?  Yes.  Your play?  Hot and geeky.  EverQuest, also known as Career Killer.  Mike from Jersey saying that.  All right, Jessica.  Thank you.  Bye.  So I destroyed his little work area. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I kind of went a little crazy, so...  Oh, well.  What can I say?  Yes, we'll play the Dungeons and Dragons thing in a minute here.  The D&D.  Want to play...  All right, we can play real fast.  It's two minutes.  Stephen Lynch.  Get a little harmonica.  Let's go.  Woo!  I'm sorry. 
[00:09:00]  I got my 12-sided die and I'm ready to roll with a wizard and my goblin crew.  My friends are coming over to my mom's basement bringing Funyuns and the Mountain Dew.  I got a big broad sword made out of cardboard and that stereo's a pumping Zeppelin.  It's that time of the night.  We turn on the black light.  Let the Dungeons and the Dragons begin.  It's D&D.  Fightin' with the legends of yore. 
[00:09:30]  It's D&D.  Never kissed a lady before.  Nope.  Woo!  All right.  Take it home.  A little solo for it.  How much time?  Now the Lord of the Rings, the Dark Crystal and things.  We use these as a reference tool.  And when we put on our cloaks and tell warlock jokes, we're the coolest kids at the school. 
[00:10:00]  No, we're not.  I know.  Now Tack's a real bastard, but a fair dungeon master.  He's got hit points and charisma to lend.  And I rehearse in my room or what I call the dragon suit.  When I'm not out with my girlfriend.  It's D&D.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You got a girlfriend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  It's D&D.  Warriors who terrify.  It's D&D. 
[00:10:30]  Virgins  Till the day we...  One, two, three, four.  Yeah!  Yeah.  Nice.  Stephen Lynch.  There you go.  Stephen Lynch.  I like that little ditty, man.  That's pretty dorky.  Jared, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good. 
[00:11:00]  Hey, Anthony, I heard you yesterday.  I'm wondering if you had your fix of sushi today or not.  Well, obviously he did not.  No, I didn't have any sushi today.  No.  The way Norton was looking at me, he was like a proud papa almost.  We were all proud.  He saw like my wheels running, like you said, in my head, just looking with that.  And there's that split second that you're deciding, should I break this or not?  Should I break it or not?  And then if you wait a little, you'll calm down.  That's where the sane person will stop. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  And that's why it was so cool.  The insane person goes crazy.  I knew how OJ felt when he had the knife in his hand.  I was sitting there, should I kill the bitch?  Look, he's got his sunglasses.  He coming up.  And OJ didn't stop and say, no, I'm not getting in trouble.  I was sitting there in my brain.  I'm going, awesome.  Totally awesome.  It was great watching you throw CDs against the monitor.  They're just smashing.  And you paused, and you're like looking, and you took your chair, and you made the decision,  yes, I will slam this hard against the desk.  I wish I had a hammer. 
[00:12:00]  I could have just handed it to you.  I would have handed it to you.  I would have just started beating you to see my keyboard letters just flying.  You know what we need in the office?  A chainsaw.  So the next time.  Behind glass?  Yeah.  And the next time you're at that state where it could go either way, I'm going to hand you  the chainsaw.  The damage you'll do, man.  Yeah.  Because at that point, you can't stop yourself.  No.  No.  And if you have a chainsaw, you get it.  So that's Ann's problem today.  And then Norton comes in in a horrible mood today.  What's your problem? 
[00:12:30]  I was just, I left my house.  I live three miles from the George Washington Bridge.  I left it about eight minutes to two.  And it took me over an hour to get here because these scumbags are doing construction the day  before Thanksgiving when everybody is driving, nobody's flying anywhere, and these Fs are  doing construction.  I was so aggravated.  If I had a little thing to throw at a keyboard, I would have done it.  I almost screamed at the cops, but then I'm like, no, that's a bad move.  Don't scream at the cops.  There shouldn't be construction at all today on any road. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, there shouldn't be any lanes closed, nothing, but it's the way they figure.  Because you know why the people that are actually making the decisions to do it, they don't  have to sit in it.  Right.  That's fine by them.  Of course, it's all fat women driving, just looking, oh, there's a big hole in the road.  Just go, you fat pigs.  Bastards.  Bastards.  All right.  Ray, what's going on?  Hey, I think we have to set up an intervention for Anthony. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah?  It's getting a little destructive, you know?  Yeah?  Maybe like this Friday on a very special O&A show.  Have an intervention?  Yeah.  You're just getting a little out of control.  I like the chainsaw idea.  But he's not alone.  There's so many people out there that are addicted to the computer games.  Oh, I know.  You know something?  It's not just that game.  A lot of games are like that.  I know people that sit and play Counter-Strike for days on end.  That's another great game.  When did computer games and just regular video games go from being fun to an addiction? 
[00:14:00]  What was the game that put it over the top?  Some people, as far as Pac-Man go, I remember people that would sit, especially at the table version of Pac-Man.  Remember the table version?  You'd see it in some of the bars and stuff and you'd sit down and you'd put your drinks down and play Pac-Man.  And just like hundreds of dollars in quarters just sitting there.  But even Pac-Man, it got to the point where you just realized, you know, the game was going way too fast for what you could do as a human. 
[00:14:30]  So you're like, you know what?  They still put more money in trying to crack that faster level.  But eventually in your head you go, all right, I've met my match.  I did really well.  Now this game is just completely ridiculous.  But the games they put out today, I think the idea that now you're taking the quality games home, it's at your house now.  You know, with the Pac-Man thing, you had to leave eventually.  Right.  Or you had to run out of quarters or something.  You had to leave the bowling alley eventually.  And it never, remember Atari put out a Pac-Man? 
[00:15:00]  It just wasn't Pac-Man.  It was this big, cheesy, big, pixelated, garbage Pac-Man.  Atari made all those games.  Atari.  Horrendous.  It sucked, and that didn't compare.  But now you go home, and you're getting the most quality games ever right at your house.  It's like the crack dealer lives in the living room.  Right.  And online.  See, the difference.  Before that, you had to get in your car and risk getting arrested and trying to find the crack man.  But now the crack man lives within your home. 
[00:15:30]  Anytime you need the crack, it's right there.  It's right there with the glass pipe.  And Steve C. goes, you know something?  Just click on the cheats, man.  Click on the cheats.  Steve C. will not play a game without putting every cheat card.  He's flying.  He's going through walls.  He's got unlimited ammo.  You know, and you could do that with the single-player games.  Multiplayer.  You can't cheat.  You'd have no cheats.  And you're online.  There's other people.  There's a hierarchy. 
[00:16:00]  There's rankings.  Oh, and it gets everyone wound up into a froth.  But for my sanity, I play the PlayStation 2 games, okay?  Yeah.  I broke one of my TVs because of my obsession with one of the Tomb Raider games.  This goes back a while, obviously.  So it's gotten to the point where when it's not fun anymore, I have to go upstairs on my computer and cheat for my sanity.  Yeah.  But that's where you and I are different.  You refuse to cheat ever.  I will never put in a cheat code.  I have no problem cheating if I feel like I've really put the effort forth on that level. 
[00:16:30]  I will not put in a cheat code.  I will not read any of the tips on how to get through sections.  Uh-uh.  When I first played Half-Life years ago, which by far is still the best single-player game ever, ever out there,  I was playing that, had to be 12 hours at a clip minimum.  I would leave here.  Oh, yeah.  Go home, not get off computer until the sun came up. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  Swear to God.  It was that bad.  And no cheat codes.  I would spend sometimes hours on one segment just trying to find something or get somewhere.  I'm crazy.  I don't know what it is.  You know how you're insane and you lose your mind?  Yeah.  I am crazy with these goddamn games.  What can I say?  You know what video game I really like?  None of them.  I'm 33.  You've never played a video game, a computer game? 
[00:17:30]  A huge part of modern life, Mr. Norton.  I scored almost $5 million on one quarter on Asteroids and an arcade.  I was 13 years old, and after that I was done.  That was it.  I found pornography, thank God.  Yeah, well, that's true.  Let's just pray they don't merge the porno with the computer games,  and we're all in serious trouble.  There are plenty of people that know exactly what I'm talking about.  If you've ever woken up with computer game hangover,  it's an actual headache and dizziness and eye pain  from staring at a first-person shooter screen scrolling through hallways. 
[00:18:00]  And you wake up and go, oh, my God, it feels like a hangover.  And I played PlayStation so much that I had PlayStation thumbs,  and I had, no joke, and a lot of people can relate to this,  I had the hands of a 90-year-old guy.  They were arthritic, no joke, to the point where I couldn't hold anything anymore  because, again, those intense situations.  Talking about Tomb Raider again, this was the one that put me over the top. 
[00:18:30]  We're going back a few years.  I know I'm dating myself.  But there were moves you had to do that you couldn't just do it nice and dainty  on the PlayStation, you know, the controller.  The jumping back flip grab thing.  All that crap where you're doing it so hard because you're intense,  and you're just destroying your hands.  Yeah.  You're destroying them.  I would come in here like, oh, my God, I have to soak my hands in ice.  Because I would play so long.  In the middle of the winter, man, it makes winters go by real fast.  You could play 10 hours on a PlayStation game, and then next thing you know, 
[00:19:00]  the sun's coming up, and you have no clue what just happened.  I've been like this, though, forever with computers.  Forever.  I was living at – I didn't even have a place to live.  I had to live at a friend's house with his family.  Like, I'm sleeping on the couch, and I had no job.  I think I was vacuuming the house and washing their dishes so I could sleep on the couch.  You're a house boy.  I finally, like, I got some money up. 
[00:19:30]  I don't even know how.  What's the first thing I did?  I went and bought a Commodore 64 computer so I could play the primitive video games.  Way to go, Kato.  I know.  Exactly.  I was Kato Kaelin.  This is back, like, years and years ago when Commodore 64 was brand new.  Right.  You know, and that was it.  You know?  Oh, Star Raiders.  I got to play it.  You know?  Hey, Dennis, what's up?  I've been like that forever.  Hey, guys, you want to know when you start losing it when Doom first came out?  Doom.  You know, my wife didn't want to speak to me. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, I was the first real good first-person shooter with the brick maze-like hallways, crappy graphics.  And then you never have enough help.  You're banging the walls trying to find something.  You can't find it.  Your wife says, well, you're going to bury it.  And it's like, no, it's Doom.  I've got to try and finish right on a sleep.  Three o'clock in the freaking morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, this is what it was.  I mean, it was like, my marriage was like, screw that.  I've got to kill a belly beast.  It was insane.  And at last level, for God's sake, things are flying all over the place. 
[00:20:30]  You can't shoot enough.  There's no help.  You have no ammunition left.  Listen to him.  You say, screw it.  We'll be coming across the room.  See?  He knows.  Can you picture this guy yelling, just don't lead him as much.  Exactly.  And Return to Castle Wolfenstein coming out.  Played the demo.  It's an online.  Unbelievable looking game.  Yeah.  Mark, what's up?  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  Real good.  Yeah.  Did you ever play video games so much during the day that you're tossing and turning at 
[00:21:00]  the night because you can't get it out of your head?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Dreaming that you're in the levels and running around, but you just can't sleep?  See, there's a definite problem here, and I know I'm not alone in this.  What about when you're in your real life and you start thinking like your surroundings  around you are a video game?  Yeah, you're looking down.  I mean, I could get on that ledge and jump from that ledge to that ledge.  I'd be looking down.  You should be across to that office building over there.  You look up somewhere and go, that would be the best sniper vantage point. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  I could explode heads like watermelons.  You really start looking around.  I mean, if you get obsessed with certain games, you will look around your regular day life.  If you're driving a car or walking the streets of Manhattan especially, and you'll start  looking at the buildings completely different.  I'm telling you.  Counter-Strike rules.  All right, man.  Oh, my God.  Look at this guy, Charlie, from North Salem.  Dude, one binge, 36 hours of Counter-Strike.  Also, I could have a 20-minute kill to death.  I don't know what he's talking about.  My eyes were burning. 
[00:22:00]  Now I have to wear glasses.  14 years old, and my eyes are already deteriorating.  Bert, what's up?  Hey, man.  I'll tell you something.  What put me over the top as a kid was Asteroids and Missile Command.  Took all of my tip money from the paper.  I remember Missile Command.  Missile Command was an awful game.  Which one was that?  Was that the one?  Oh, okay.  We had to blow up the missiles that were coming in.  It just chewed up all the money.  It took the money from the kids.  But, you know, my wife's ready to dump my ass because of all the hours I'm putting in 
[00:22:30]  on Winback and PS2.  Yeah.  See?  And now Xbox is out.  You know, it's really fun after the show to go back to the office and watch Earl and  whoever else play Halo on Xbox.  Earl is so completely bad.  You play a two-player on a split screen on the TV and over-under.  So you could watch each person's vantage point and point of view.  And if it's Steve C. or John the intern and they're playing against Earl, you'll always  see the guy on the split screen with Earl in his sights. 
[00:23:00]  Earl's spinning around not knowing where to shoot, just getting hacked to pieces.  Yeah, you can hear him at 30 seconds into play and he's like, oh, I suck.  I suck.  I suck.  I'm going to go call and see if I can get a shot on the show.  John the intern.  Yeah.  John the intern got bored playing Earl.  He got bored playing Earl.  This guy loves games.  Yeah.  And he got bored because it's just a turkey shoot.  It's Earl running around in circles and you shooting him.  He shot me, actually.  I played one round with him yesterday.  Did you?  You're worse than him? 
[00:23:30]  I was like, wow, this was fun.  And I left.  You know, before we finish up this little discussion here, we got to mention that the people that  have taken their addictions even further, like you still have a life outside your gaming.  Somewhat.  There are people that have pretty much given up on a regular life and they are living their  lives online.  Online communities and camaraderies.  With some of these video games, I know some of that will remain nameless, excuse me. 
[00:24:00]  He plays a game.  That's all he does.  Yeah.  He goes to work to pay his bills.  He comes home and he gets right back on the online game.  Tribes.  Tribes.  That's another addictive game.  Yeah.  It's online.  The guy has...  Killing with squads and whatnot.  The guy has given up on his life, given up on socializing.  Yeah.  A middle of the summer, it's 90 degrees out where everyone else is hanging and he is in  his room online living his life because he has major, major status online.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Major.  It stinks.  What is wrong with people?  It's an online community out there.  Yeah, they stink.  It's all fat guys with pimples.  Do it for a few minutes and then go out and pick up a hooker.  What's the matter with you people?  But that's where it's heading.  These people are living their lives online because a lot of people feel like their regular  lives suck.  They're stuck working at a deli or whatever and they just, in their minds, think they're  going to become nothing in life.  But online, you can get all sorts of status the longer you're playing these games and  interacting with other people around the world. 
[00:25:00]  That's exactly true.  There are people that have nothing to crow about in life.  Maybe they have a job they're not very happy with.  They're not in a relationship.  And then they get online and they get in these communities online with various games  and all of a sudden they're commanding, they're wearing things that show that they've reached  certain levels.  All of a sudden they have this online life that's better than their real life.  You know what the answer to that is?  It's a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
[00:25:30]  I can't get laid, but I'm a command guy.  I'm the first.  Shut your mouth, stupid.  A bunch of zeros in this country.  I've got to give you that.  That's funny.  I'm a commander.  I can't get laid.  Tony, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, I just wonder if you guys ever played to a point where you forgot what you were working  on.  What do you mean?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You get to a certain point of level and it's kind of a lot of things you've got to do to 
[00:26:00]  achieve the goal and you forget what you were doing.  I've done that.  I've done that.  I've got military strategy games on my PlayStation and Nintendo and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I've played them forever and I just get lost.  What the hell I was working on?  I had to go back and regroup.  It was terrible.  Yeah.  Then there are games like Age of Empires I've been playing, which is like a juggling act.  You make yourself a fortified zone and people are attacking you from all over. 
[00:26:30]  And all you're doing is going, oh, my God, the front gate's getting hit.  And you've got to send resources over there and start rebuilding.  Oh, my God, my flank is getting hit.  And you're just like sitting there going insane as they're trying to breach your fortress.  Norton, you're looking at me like I'm insane.  But I swear to God, there are so many people that are doing this.  You know what there also were a lot of people that did?  They murdered Jews in the 40s.  Because a lot of people are doing it doesn't mean it's right. 
[00:27:00]  Okay.  I never thought the Hitler analogy would come out, but all right.  Not a relative comparison.  Online gaming, Hitler.  Okay.  Billy.  Play Castle Wolfenstein.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Billy, Billy.  Hey.  What's up, Billy?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, man.  Have you guys played Grand Theft Auto 3 yet?  Getting rave reviews.  Steve loves it.  My God.  Steve loves it.  Steve, Grand Theft Auto 3.  Everything that you wish you could do in real life.  Like, let's say you see a cop or something.  You're like, man, I just wish I could kill him. 
[00:27:30]  What?  No, no, no.  Who's thinking that in real life?  Run up, steal the cop's car, kill cops.  It's just great.  You can kill anybody you want.  Get on top of roofs.  Take out helicopters.  I mean, and there's no coincidence.  I mean, it's just awesome.  What's the name of the game?  How to be Puerto Rican?  Grand Theft Auto 3.  Consequences.  Grand Theft Auto 3.  Whatever.  All right, Billy.  Impunity.  Impunity, right.  It's really, Stinky loves it, too.  It's fantastic.  Good game for the stinkster?  Yeah.  It's like playing cops, but you're the guy running away from the cops. 
[00:28:00]  Can you hide under the baby pool in the backyard?  You can run through yards.  The helicopters come after you.  You blow them up.  Then they get the FBI and tanks after you.  Okay.  It's great.  I hear it.  It's getting rave reviews.  You steal any car you want, run out, shoot the driver in the head, take off.  You've got six cars and a police cop that are chasing you, and you can blow up anything  with, like, rocket launchers.  It's really good.  What kind of view do you get?  Is it an overview?  No, it's behind the car.  Oh, it is.  Okay, because I didn't like the first ones because it was like an overview of a flat. 
[00:28:30]  Now it's kind of like first person.  You can pick up hookers to get more health.  Oh, Norton, you might like this game a little more.  Wait, you can pick up hookers to get more health?  Yeah, you pick up hookers.  Oh, look at that.  That's different than real life, huh?  Your car starts...  You usually get less health.  Oh, your money goes down and your car starts rocking?  Yeah.  You have to find the secret alley.  And then...  Ooh.  The secret alley.  And then whenever they get out, you just get out and beat them with a bat and steal their  money.  Are you kidding?  Are you serious?  Yes.  That's a fine video game. 
[00:29:00]  There was a game, Kingpin, that was out.  I think Kingpin 2 is going to be coming out.  That was a cool game because it was another game where you could just go around and just  beat people dead right there on the street with clubs, your fists, knives, or shoot them.  And the flamethrower was always good.  They could just...  They'd be running away screaming and you're just beating them on the head with a bat.  It really was a sick game.  I think 2 is coming out on that one, too. 
[00:29:30]  Kingpin 2.  Yeah.  Can you beat the hooker with a bat?  That is so good.  Shooter, anything.  Yeah.  Whatever you want to do.  I'll take yellow discipline for 100 points.  There was one in Kingpin.  I walked into a room and there was a hooker in the room and I wanted to see what she had  in her fridge, so I shot her in the head.  Because if I would have...  She was standing in front of the fridge.  She was standing in front of the fridge and if I would have made any violent moves toward  her, she would have ran and maybe tipped someone off that I was there.  And then, you know what was in the fridge?  Nothing.  Yeah, it's odd because hookers usually have a good fridge stock of things. 
[00:30:00]  That's why they do it, to get better meatloaf.  Well, there was some money.  In one fridge, I checked, there was money in there, so I figured, you know.  Hey, Eric, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You tell us.  Come on.  Well, about a year ago, actually, it was last Christmas.  My girlfriend got me a Dreamcast.  And I started playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2.  And I got addicted to that.  And I had to get a bigger, better TV.  I got a 36-inch TV.  It cost like $900.  And I just, I kept on playing, kept on playing. 
[00:30:30]  Got Rainbow Six, Rogue Spear.  Yeah.  And in that, it's a single-person shooter.  Plus, you control every other team.  Yeah, I remember playing that.  You got to send them off at the right time.  I screwed up the timing after playing for 18 hours.  I freaked out, grabbed the Dreamcast, threw it through the TV, broke the tube, broke the TV, everything.  Threw it through the television.  I don't blame you.  I think the guys that write some of these games are sadistic apps.  That's great.  And they get back at us.  I hate when you have to go so far in a level. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  And then at the end, it's almost impossible to get through.  And then, you know, obviously, you get killed.  You got to start to begin the level, which could take you an hour or two just to get back to where you were before you got killed.  And that's if you're lucky.  And you do it over and over and over again.  It drives me insane.  All right.  All right, Eric.  Good job.  All right.  Not in the rules.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We got to take a break, man.  We're just getting started today.  Well, see, I think that helped out a lot of people today.  I think we showed you you're not alone. 
[00:31:30]  Okay.  On the show today, Mr. DVD calling back.  Oh, he's calling up?  Yeah.  You missed Mr. DVD.  Oh, that's right.  You're in Vegas.  You're in Vegas.  Colin Quinn stopping by today at 430.  More ladies for Shave Bush for Bush.  The last day of our little campaign, by the way.  Yes.  Helping out.  And if you're lucky, President Reagan calling in.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  As long as he...  I don't think he's going to be leveling to 21 today.  So, he should be in today.  Maybe we should get Reagan on the phone soon. 
[00:32:00]  Maybe we should.  I heard he was playing a video game and he got so mad he took one of his wife's breasts  off and threw it at the screen.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  That was Ford, you idiot.  We'll have to...  Nancy had some of that, too.  Seems to be the first lady disease.  Did she lose the whole thing, though?  Yep.  Poor lady.  Ouch.  And if you're lucky, we're going to...  And if you're lucky, we're going to let the...  We're going to let the lobster loose today, everyone. 
[00:32:30]  Ho, ho!  We're going to let the lobster loose.  What was that?  We're going to let the lobster loose.  We're going to tease him for two and a half hours and we're going to let the lobster loose.  I don't even know what that was.  To kick off the big holiday weekend.  We're going to let the lobster loose, everyone.  We listened to something.  I don't even know what it was.  What?  That was the comedic stylings of Snorton Norton out of Buffalo, New York.  Bad.  Bad radio.  I actually, at one point, were listening to the tape and I'm like, are people listening to this? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Let the lobster loose.  And then it's...  What is it?  Steve Martin talking about, hey, look out, there's a lobster on the loose.  Yeah.  Get some lemon and butter.  Well, that's after they teased it for two and a half hours.  Yeah.  And then they let it loose and they play this Steve Martin clip and it's jovial.  I guess it's funny.  It's peachy keen.  There you go.  So if you're lucky, we'll let the lobster loose on our show today.  Great.  Well, we've got to tease it for two and a half hours. 
[00:33:30]  Awful radio.  Hide your toes so they don't get bitten.  Who has the butter?  Horrible radio.  Start boiling the water.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ha.  Die getting a coffin.  Felt like it was 1988 all over again.  I was living in Buffalo.  I'm like, what happened to my life?  Just horrible radio.  Same exact thing from 13 years ago, Norton.  Or Norton.  The funny one.  Jim Norton.  Nah.  So why don't we let the lobster loose today, everyone?  Great. 
[00:34:00]  Хорошо.  What?  They have these big kids.  They're big kids.  Whip, whip, whip, whip.  They're big kids.  They're big kids.  Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip.  They're big kids.  Wednesday.  It's off the hook, yo.  Opie and Dan.  Henry Sam Adams.  Yes.  Thanksgiving tomorrow.  It's a very distinctly American holiday, isn't it?  Good to see family.  Eat the turkey stuffing, cranberry sauce.  Distinctly American foods.  And Sam Adams, a distinctly American beer with a world-class taste. 
[00:34:30]  Celebrate Thanksgiving with the quality of a distinctly American beer.  Sam Adams.  We love it here.  They sent us a bunch, and we're drinking it.  We're almost out.  We talk about it like it's military supplies, and we're at the front line.  Who today said, I don't think this is going to last until Christmas?  Yeah.  Stinky said that.  Stinky said that about our Sam Adams beer.  It's like the soldiers are sitting there going, how much ammo have you got?  I got one clip.  I got a grenade.  I got that.  I don't think this is going to last until Christmas. 
[00:35:00]  We're too nice with our Sam Adams, though.  We need another shipment.  We give it out like water when people come around here.  I know.  You know why?  It says, hey, be my friend.  I'm giving you a world-class beer.  It's Sam Adams.  Trade up this Thanksgiving and celebrate with a truly great American beer.  Sam Adams.  B.O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Ram Jam.  Black Biddy.  Classic jocks with classic rock. 
[00:35:30]  Great.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  Give us a call, okay?  In the studio, Jim Norton and Colin Quinn stopping by to say, Colin.  Hey.  How you been, man?  How's it going, guys?  Good.  And I had to introduce Norton to the porn star outside of the studio.  You know, you had to reintroduce him.  Reintroduce?  It's something you'd never, ever think you'd have to say to somebody.  Well, sometimes when you have to reintroduce someone, you have to remind them how that person knows the person. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, but it's usually something like, oh, you might remember her from the Christmas party last year.  You remember we bumped into you at the game that we saw the other day?  No, Norton had to be reminded that this was the woman that put an ice cube in her balloon knot, and Norton ate it out of her balloon knot.  And it's like, oh, Norton, hey, Norton, you remember this girl?  Remember, you went to the back door and sucked a ice cube out. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, hey, how you doing?  Hey, long time no see.  Shaved, too.  Not the ice cube, the balloon knot.  Right.  All shaved.  Nice.  Hairless.  But instead of doing that type of fun radio, we're going to let the lobster loose today, guys.  What do you say?  What do you say?  What?  You know, I'm not from Buffalo.  I never lived up there.  Dude.  Never worked up there.  You got to.  Well, all right.  There's a guy like this in every single city, though. 
[00:37:00]  I understand that.  Just really, really bad radio.  And that bit, I didn't get it.  I heard this promo.  It's called let the lobster loose.  I heard it.  I heard that.  You're promoted all morning.  You get people psyched.  And I thought it was a contest or something, maybe.  I thought it was something.  And then all of a sudden, he just plays an old Steve Martin clip.  Steve Martin clip.  Yeah.  About a lobster getting out of a tank, and it's running around, I guess.  And he's saying, oh, get the butter.  Get the butter. 
[00:37:30]  Get the lemon.  It's loose.  Uh-oh.  Watch out, everybody.  And that was it.  But that then signifies that the weekend is upon us.  Oh.  Because now the lobster's loose.  All right.  You're going to get zanerific out there.  Well, now it makes sense.  Deuce chills.  Zany, wacky horn.  Okay.  Well, now it makes sense.  Good.  You know what?  You know when that's funny?  When you let the lobster loose, and 30 seconds later, there's a girl yelling, help.  The lobster has his claws, and he's gripping my C. 
[00:38:00]  That's when it's funny.  Is that cervix?  Yeah.  Cervix.  Credit card.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, Damien, what's up?  I don't know.  I just can't understand that, like, Americans in other parts of this country are that stupid  that they can listen to this brain fodder and think it's funny.  Like, are the brain stems cut off when they were babies?  Yeah, something's not.  Like, it just makes no sense.  Well, the only...  And then I'm like, does anyone listen to this?  Well, the only saving grace for shows like that, you know, they still force them to play, 
[00:38:30]  you know, the moldy, oldy, classic rock.  So they figure, okay, they're not going to wreck the station too bad because we'll let  him banter and do his little let the lobster loose thing, and then he'll have to intro and  hit the post with that god-awful Boston song.  Yeah, play it with Boston.  So, if you have to still play music on your show, you stink.  Basically, I've been listening to, like, bowel movements, honestly.  It's called evolution.  Look into it.  I mean, everyone starts in the radio business playing a little tunes and doing their wacky 
[00:39:00]  banter in between, their weather checks, time checks, Anthony, right?  Time and weather.  And then eventually you evolve, hopefully, into some type of a talk show.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure they're better to listen to than Richard Jenny all day.  All right.  Dude, I'm going to talk up the Boston song.  Hit the post.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Uh-huh.  Bye.  You're right over there, right? 
[00:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Scorch.  You seem bothered.  No.  No?  Scorch is on the phone.  Okay.  Uh, Scorch, what's up?  I want to talk up a Boston rap if I can.  Hey, what's up, man?  Scorch, do you still have to play music on your show in the series?  Uh, we are down in the kingdom of nakedness to probably two songs an hour.  Oh, see?  It's called the, it's called evolution.  It's called, there's no question about it.  And I've got to tell you something, and I'm not just stroking you guys for no reason,  but, uh, it's certainly, the way it's going certainly has a lot to do with you guys. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, we're having an influence on people out there, are we?  Yeah, I would say so.  I read an article, uh, one of the radio, one of those radio trade papers, and it said something  about how hot talk is the new thing, uh, and then it said, think of Opie and Anthony  on WNW New York.  Ah, there you go.  Look at that.  So, yeah, and it's true.  There's no question about it.  And we talk to Scorch every so often, so now you're kind of using that, uh, and, uh, 
[00:40:30]  getting less music on your show, the kingdom of nakedness.  And instead of enjoying that fine, uh, Boston song, we'll, we'll waste the time talking to  Scorch for five minutes.  Thank you very much.  So you have replaced one of those classic, uh, rock songs for us.  Thank you.  That's very touching.  Thank you guys.  Scorch?  Yeah.  Isn't this the big weekend for you?  Here it is.  There's one of these guys in every city in America doing this thing.  Scorch.  Scorch has got this one in Syracuse.  Scorch, why don't you tell the fine folks what you're doing for the next, uh, what,  three or four days?  Uh, three or four days. 
[00:41:00]  Starting Friday, I go into a trailer, which is called, it's called a marathon for meals.  I, this time I'm going for a ton of food a day, which is, uh, I mean, it's a good thing.  You know, it's, uh, I sleep in a trailer.  I live in a trailer.  I don't shower, which is not that bad of a deal because I don't shower anyway, even when  I'm at home.  Yeah.  And, uh, we just basically out there just as a conscious effort to kind of soften my,  uh, my, uh, my, uh, out, uh, these people.  What? 
[00:41:30]  Your, your phone's crapping out.  I know my phone's crapping out.  I said soften my outward appearance to these people.  These people think I'm harsh.  So I have to.  Scorch, Scorch, Scorch.  Let me help you out a little bit.  You're basically broadcasting until you fill the trailer with food, right?  No, not this time.  This time.  Oh, you're not doing that bit this year?  No, in the past, that's how we've done it.  But this time we are doing it, uh, just a ton a day.  They don't want me out there for four days, for more than four days.  So what if you don't, uh, raise a ton of food?  One of those days.  That's not even a, I'm not even concerned about that.  Well, they just humiliate you in, in public? 
[00:42:00]  I'm not even.  See, that would be funny to listen to.  Right.  That won't even happen.  No.  That won't even happen.  Actually, I got some, I'm sending you guys a tape of some of the stuff on the show  because some of the stuff I think you would find kind of humorous as well.  Why don't you run a bias, Scorch?  What's that?  Why don't you run some of those bias?  Yeah.  No, no, no, just stuff that, uh, I mean, it's not like bit driven.  Just things that have happened on the, although brainless Bush or Bush was pretty funny.  I had two, uh.  What, what, what, what?  Brainless Bush or Bush.  I had two people with brain injuries playing Bush or Bush last week, which is kind of funny. 
[00:42:30]  Where it's, uh, Bush or a cat.  Well, yeah, it's a Bush or a cat, yes.  Right.  And, uh, two people with brain injuries playing that head-to-head was kind of funny.  Something there, uh, Scorch.  Uh, but, uh, you know, so stuff like that.  We're going to do at the Marathon for Meals, one of the handicapped kids, I think, is going  to do the Wheelie of Fortune.  The Wheelie of Fortune.  Which is where he really is.  He will pop a wheelie in his wheelchair and he will stay doing that wheelie and we're going  to take, uh, we're going to take, uh, some sort of donation thing as to how long he can 
[00:43:00]  stay doing a wheelie or something.  I don't know.  We're going to figure out something.  How do you do a Wheelie of Fortune?  How do you do a Wheelie of Fortune in a wheelchair?  I don't get it.  Well, I mean, he's going to, it has to do with him doing a wheelie in the wheelchair.  Okay.  And then where does it go from there?  Uh, we're not quite sure.  I'm either going to do something where it's going to be, he's going to be, uh, uh, either  spinning himself around at some point or, or pushing himself.  I mean, there's something, some sort of distance thing when it comes to, uh, when it comes to  his wheelie. 
[00:43:30]  Why don't you have him do like an Evel Knievel and try to jump four lanes of traffic?  I think that's how we got in the wheelchair to begin with, man.  During rush hour.  You know, that's how we got there to begin with.  Well, how about this?  Whoever donates the most money gets to push him into a pit of crushed glass.  Someone's suggesting, do so dressing too, electric boogaloo.  Oh, there you go.  That could work too.  Electric boogaloo.  All right, Scorch.  So that's about the way that goes.  But let me, uh, let me say thanks to all my peeps in Massachusetts and all my people,  I get so much response for being on your show from California and from Houston and, 
[00:44:00]  and, and, and from, actually from Washington and Philadelphia.  They love Scorch.  They love Gary Goldstein.  So I just want to, he's dead, man.  He ain't no longer around.  But I want to say thanks to everybody.  But, uh, no program directors calling you to get, yeah, to get you the hell out of Syracuse,  huh?  I know, but we're going to work on that starting next week, guys, aren't we?  Yeah, well, we're trying.  Yeah, so I'm going to get, like, I want you to have a, I mean, we had this one guy call us  up a couple weeks ago.  It was the day that Rose McGowan was on with, uh, what's his face over there? 
[00:44:30]  All right.  Okay.  And this guy thought that he was talking to, he had my news girl thinking that he was talking  to Rose McGowan and, and it was just, it was actually very funny radio.  And, and, and yeah, that was good.  Thank you.  And, uh, so that's the guy, I mean, I want to send you some of that kind of stuff because  it was actually very funny.  It's not like, like, radio funny.  It was just funny.  Hey, Scorch, do you let the lobster loose in Syracuse?  Oh, that's funny.  What's that mean? 
[00:45:00]  Is that some inside thing you guys ain't telling me about?  Some lame bit from Buffalo.  Oh, speaking of which, a girl named that works with me now used to work with you, Opie, and  Buffalo.  Uh, what's her name?  Her name would be Marty, shoot.  Marty, I don't even know her last name.  Marty.  Marty, she's a news girl for our new, uh.  Great, say hi to Marty.  Well, she asked me all about you.  When she did, did you do nights there and she did afternoons or middays or something  like that?  Uh, no.  I don't remember any Martys.  Uh, maybe she didn't go by that name then. 
[00:45:30]  I have no idea.  But anyway, she told me to say hi.  Smell weed every day.  All right, Scorch.  Thank you.  Hey, happy, uh, happy Thanksgiving to everybody.  Yeah.  And, uh, and thanks again for talking to us.  All right.  There he goes.  Our buddy, our pal, Scorch.  We're trying to get him out of Syracuse and so far it's not working.  Somewhere didn't you be working?  All right, Scorch.  I can smell.  Hey, Scorch1.com.  The chat room's up and running, by the way.  Oh, the site's up?  Uh, Scorch1.com.  The Kingdom of Nakedness.  The site is almost fully active right now.  We've got the, we've got the chat rooms working and, uh, it'll be complete by the end. 
[00:46:00]  What's up?  What's up with Colin Quinn?  You all right over there?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Go ahead.  Say what you're thinking.  Kingdom of Nakedness.  Whoa, the whole browser shakes when you go there.  His show is called The Kingdom of Nakedness.  Are you naked?  Look, it says, are you naked?  On top.  It's totally nude radio, Colin.  Home and chat.  I can smell the acid washer.  I like it.  I like that shaking browser thing.  Isn't that nice, huh?  Chat room's up and running.  All right, Scorch1.  Okay, ma'am.  Thank you.  Have a good holiday, guys.  All right. 
[00:46:30]  There he goes.  It just flashes, are you naked?  He's too much.  Now, you know, we should have played the Boston song there.  Oh, brother.  All right, let's go to our buddy Gary here.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm sorry I haven't called you.  That's all right.  I just wanted to say, I may be off the topic, but with the games.  Oh, yeah.  Video games.  I swear.  The computer game that's worse for me, Red Faction.  Oh, you play the Red Faction.  Oh, my God.  I played it, like, ten straight hours. 
[00:47:00]  And then with the PlayStation, what was it?  Parasite Eve.  Oh, yeah?  That's a little, you know.  Well, it says on the screen that you can help Anthony.  You got over your addiction somehow.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah?  How did you do it?  Well, when I was playing my PlayStation, you know how, Anthony, when you get up to the  final level in video games, your heart starts to beat and your hands start to, you know,  sweat?  Sure there, Gary. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Well, when that happened, I was so close to being in the game, I lost.  I grabbed my PlayStation.  How'd you say?  Just threw it against the wall.  Yeah, a little violence.  Nice.  That's good.  So I said, that's it.  I'm not going to play any video games.  I packed them up, brought them out.  Now I play them, like, once in an hour.  Hey, Gary.  Yeah?  Hope he take you to that Islander game yet?  I'm not going to get into it.  Because I know what happens when I get into it.  Oh, no.  I'll take you to an Islander game.  All right.  All right.  I don't want to get into it, because I don't want you to, you know, get angry again. 
[00:48:00]  No, I'm not going to get angry.  I'm going to take you to that Islander game.  All right.  All right?  All right.  All right, bro.  All right.  See you.  Peace.  There he goes, Gary.  He's a fine young man.  He'll never see an Islander game.  I'll take him to the game.  Who is he?  Huh?  He's 11 years old there, Colin Quinn.  Really?  And he calls in.  Take him to the Paula Poundstone concert.  I would have appreciated that.  I'd count on for two weeks.  That would be good.  Wouldn't that be good?  All right.  I guess we've got to move on. 
[00:48:30]  Paul from Center Reach writes, talking about the video game stuff, I almost tapped a lady  out of my way on the highway, just like in NASCAR Thunder 2002 for the PlayStation 2.  Leave a donut on there, Tor.  Because we were talking about how it starts to get a little too real, and you feel like  you're playing the game when you're not.  Yeah.  And then Eva from Cleveland.  By the way, there is a porn Tetris game.  Porn Tetris?  The blocks are now porn stars, and if you match them together correctly, they moan and  act out the position.  Lovely.  That is fun, right?  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Okay.  Huh?  Yeah, go ahead.  I didn't want to be a whore.  I just wanted to do it normal.  Ah, normal plug.  Ah, normal plug.  I just had to, only because we're going tonight to Governors in Medford at 8 o'clock.  I'll be with Awful Rich Voss and Disgraceful Mike DiNicola, and then we're going to stop  by and watch Anthony, like 90% of everybody else in Long Island.  Oh, that's going to be fun tonight.  We're at Sergeant Pepper's over there in East Northport.  But your gig is...  On Jericho Turnpike.  That's later on.  That's later on.  Yeah, you could like catch...  You could do too. 
[00:49:30]  What time's your show at Governors?  8 p.m.  8?  Oh, absolutely.  You go 8 o'clock, you see you guys, and then you guys come over to Sergeant Pepper's  there in East Northport on Jericho Turnpike.  We're going to have a lot of people down there.  It's going to be a jam fest.  We've got real bands coming down that we're just going to...  Everyone is going to get up on stage and start playing.  That's going from Medford to East Northport.  That's like, you know, Paris to Milan.  It is.  If you take the Concord, you can get there real fast. 
[00:50:00]  Isn't it?  It's like one end of Long Island to the other.  Medford.  Medford.  A despicable little town.  It's awful.  It's the worst.  Can you do your Hillary line?  I know I'm like totally, you know, doing what you shouldn't do in comedy, but...  He's got a great Hillary Clinton line.  What's that?  I like Anthony.  What's that?  I know.  What's that?  The setup is horrible.  I know.  I understand that.  No, just that Hillary is about as sincere as a lap dance.  That sums it up right there, doesn't it? 
[00:50:30]  All right, we're going to take a break, Anthony.  We have the porno star.  What is the porno star doing today?  Is she doing the Shade Bush for Bush thing?  Doing whatever we want, obviously.  Hopefully having a cold beverage.  Do you want to do the ice cream thing again?  No, that just kind of popped out, actually, and it landed in my hand that I put in my mouth.  It just kind of happened.  I didn't plan on that happening.  The greatest improvisation happens that way.  I know.  He's explaining, like, yeah, it was really no big deal, you know?  I thought it fell on the floor, but it didn't really. 
[00:51:00]  I wouldn't have thought Monty Python got started.  I think you're the guy.  Hey, Colin, you playing Caroline's?  Yeah.  You're too polite to plug, aren't you?  I'm playing there this weekend.  No, I have too much false humility to plug.  I'm there this weekend with this, our horrible man, Norton.  Oh, Norton, you're playing Caroline's, too?  Working together, yeah.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, I kind of thought he was going to work it into the Medford thing, but apparently he didn't.  He left it up to me to whore myself.  Or yourself.  So we're there all weekend, yeah. 
[00:51:30]  But we like that, because then you're all uncomfortable and stuff.  Yeah.  All right, President Reagan is calling in next.  Yes, he is.  And I'm sure of President Reagan.  We'll be on the air next.  Stay there.  Next Monday on the Opie and Anthony Show, Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, Lincoln Park, one step closer. 
[00:52:00]  I didn't know you were singing for Lincoln Park, Opie.  Shut up!  That first shut up, he says, sounds exactly like one of the shut up clips we have of Opie.  All right, you got me in my spare time.  I go on tour with the band.  Is that what you're doing?  I don't sing for them.  I just do the shut up, and then I leave the stage. 
[00:52:30]  We should do the exact comparison.  Do we have the first shut up?  Yeah, all right, hold on.  Listen to this one, and then you.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  That's it.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Everything you say!  Wow.  Rock!  How about that?  All right.  We're here at the O&A Show.  We got Jim Norton in the studio, Colin Quinn in the studio.  It's technically a Friday. 
[00:53:00]  Uh, yeah.  You realize that.  Sure, why not?  Technically.  Uh, Anthony, before we get to Reagan, who should be calling any minute now, right?  I see him.  Uh, he's on hold there.  There's an empty phone line.  It says Ronald Reagan on there.  Well, that's really his nurse, and they're not getting him.  So, yeah, technically we got the phone on hold, but they're still trying to track him  down.  Right.  All right.  You know how we talk about the unlucky lottery?  The unlucky lottery, yeah.  You want to explain the unlucky lottery to Colin Quinn? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, this is kind of like, um, something happens to you.  The odds of it happening are the same odds as winning the lottery and winning millions and  setting yourself up for life.  Only it's the other end.  It's the unlucky lottery where the same odds, uh, are in place, but, uh, it's for something  awful happening to you.  And yet, it happened anyway.  The unlucky lottery.  Unlucky lottery.  Instead of winning the million dollars, you're dead because of something stupid happening.  Right.  Happening.  One in a million shot.  You have to die?  Well, usually death or some kind of horrid, uh, way to live out your life. 
[00:54:00]  Could you end up in Medford at eight o'clock tonight?  For the Jim Norton show?  The unlucky lottery.  Being Jim Norton, right.  At Governors?  Uh, we had the unlucky lottery yesterday, Anthony.  Which one was that?  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, the jet ski guy.  Jet ski guy.  Listen to this one, Colin.  55 miles an hour, he's on his jet ski out, uh, in the water, really buzzing.  His friend goes to check, uh, his speed with a radar gun.  He grabs the gun, looks back. 
[00:54:30]  His friend's not on the jet ski.  He is, uh, off of it.  Uh, they go up there.  He's dead.  His friend's dead.  Seems he, uh, he, it was hit in the head at 55 miles an hour by a duck.  By a 15 pound mallard that they said might as well have been a cinder block at that speed.  I mean, what are the odds?  What are the odds, Colin?  Oh.  You get better odds, uh, winning lotto.  But no, he didn't win lotto.  He won a duck to his head.  Right.  A duck with anthrax.  Yeah.  Ah, that would be even worse.  And then we had all the stupid jokes, like, why didn't he duck? 
[00:55:00]  Oh.  Oh, what was the other one that, uh, someone came up with?  The, uh...  This friend yelled, pull.  Pull!  So we have another unlucky lottery, uh, winner here today.  Yeah, this one involving a, uh...  A cross.  Seven-year-old French girl.  Cross kills girl seven at brother's grave.  What are the odds of this happening to you?  A seven-year-old French girl died after being crushed by a cross that fell from a tombstone  as she and her family visited her brother's grave. 
[00:55:30]  The stone cross fell from an old tomb, hitting the girl whose brother died as a baby eight years ago in the stomach.  Her parents took her to a doctor who sent her to a hospital.  She died Monday of the injuries.  So, Jesus.  The couple in their 30s were taking flowers to decorate their baby's grave with their daughter and a second son, who is 11.  What are the odds that that happens to you, Colin?  See, that's a, that's an example of two things that we've talked about on the show.  That, A, first, there is no God, and secondly, um, uh, the unlucky lottery thing that we talk about. 
[00:56:00]  If there was a God, and you're doing what you're supposed to do, Colin, Colin just spilled coffee all over himself, and the console.  It was just the, uh...  It was the tragedy, it really got to me.  I never saw you do that while you were doing the news on SNL.  You know?  No, that would have been too amusing.  Wow!  Wow!  Abusing yourself, always nice. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  I was thinking about that poor little French girl, you know?  Yeah, see, it got you all flustered.  Yeah.  Exactly.  The image of a seven-year-old girl, French girl with a cross impaled on her.  Brought that combination of sexuality and religion in my childhood that...  Right!  Spilled my coffee all over.  The cross was probably there hundreds of years.  It's at an old grave.  In France, to be an old grave, you've got to be very old.  The cross sitting there for a lot of years.  At that moment, the cross just decides, you know what?  It's time to fall down.  Going to fall down on the poor little French girl. 
[00:57:00]  Once again, putting her in the whole image of Wile E. Coyote.  Right.  Sitting there.  And that's it.  A lot of unopened presents under that tree this year.  Yeah.  I guess so.  Why are you smiling, then?  I love stories like that.  God.  One less in the world.  All right, so...  A French and a child.  It's on both levels.  They're telling me that Reagan's almost ready.  Oh, he is?  They're preparing Reagan. 
[00:57:30]  Yes, he'll be on the show in about a minute or two.  See, I've got to...  Can you hold him off a little longer?  I've got to go take a leak.  I know I never do this in the middle of the show, but if I could just...  Just hold Reagan a little longer.  But, Ann, you never take a break during the show.  Hold Reagan off a little longer.  No, Ann, you usually...  I think I'll be right back.  You usually let the interns get your beer to Sam Adams.  Was the little girl a vampire?  It's very strange, Colin.  Every time Reagan calls for some reason, Ann needs to step out of the studio. 
[00:58:00]  I don't really understand it at all.  I think he's intimidated.  He's intimidated?  Yes.  Why?  Speak to the former president?  Yes.  By Reagan's greatness?  Just the fact that Reagan is a former president.  He's a very wise man.  Well, hopefully, Anthony will make it back before Reagan hangs up, okay?  Use a lot of powder, Mommy.  Well, I don't want to get a rash.  Wait.  Hello.  Mr. Reagan.  Hello, my fellow Americans.  It's your pals, Opie and Anthony.  We've got Jim Norton in the studio.  Colin Quinn.  Hi.  Hi, Mr. President. 
[00:58:30]  Hello, sir.  Hello.  Yeah.  Yes, well, as long as that hack boss isn't there.  Well, he's outside the studio, sir.  Yes.  We can bring him in if you'd like to talk to him as well.  No, no.  No?  No.  Hello.  So what's going on?  Well, first I want to say I haven't spoken out about world events lately.  Yeah.  Because I didn't feel I could make an informed decision until, well, I had all the facts.  Yeah.  And also, for the past two months, I thought I was a pumpkin. 
[00:59:00]  Hello?  I'm a pumpkin, Mommy.  Mommy, I'm a pumpkin.  No, no, no.  Get him back on the phone.  You candy apple-shaped bitch.  Nancy with that big head, that huge head of hers.  It's quite frightening.  She's got that dead stare.  Yeah.  Lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes.  We'll never put on a life jacket again. 
[00:59:30]  Nancy looks like a Steve Madden shoe commercial.  Big, ghastly head.  I hear she's the favorite at the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Big-headed first lady.  She's going to be in the parade this year, huh?  Disgusting.  Big head.  She looks like a Mardi Gras float, right?  Mardi Gras float head.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's unfortunate and quite scary, quite frankly. 
[01:00:00]  Well.  All right, I get it.  Your wife has a big head.  I want to say that I'm honored to learn that an airport has been named after me.  Yeah, in Washington.  I've never been so proud to be Ronald Logan in my life.  Oh, no, no, no.  Ronald Dulles International.  You're naming other airports from other cities.  No, no.  Sally Kramer.  No, Ronald Dulles.  Sally Kramer. 
[01:00:30]  Joe Dildo.  Joe Dildo.  Joe Dildo.  No, now you're stealing someone else's act, sir.  Well, I can't help it.  My brain sits in my skull like a shrinky dink, getting smaller by, well, by the day.  No, the airport's in Washington.  Oh.  Yes.  Well, I'd like to lead.  I was always a great leader.  I'd like to lead our country in prayer.  Okay.  Now I lay me down to sleep. 
[01:01:00]  I pray the Lord my soul to keep.  If he hollers, let him go.  So, eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  I'm at Ali Ali Oxenfree.  God bless Guatemala.  No, sorry.  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down your dress.  Why would you want to see that?  Well, I was listening to yesterday's show, and you had that Brady kid on.  That would be Greg Brady.  Yes.  When he took a bullet for me.  No, no, no.  I was being assassinated.  No, no, no. 
[01:01:30]  That's another Brady.  You know, usually.  No, that's.  What?  Hello?  That's another Brady, sir.  What?  That's another Brady.  Who?  Jim.  Oh, Jim Brady was the middle one.  No.  He was quite the jumping with his big head in front of.  Boy, if Nancy was there, she could have saved me.  Yes, she did.  That big head.  Jim Brady's head now looks like Linus from Peanuts.  It's that big, lumpy, you know, I want to say.  Sir, he's a great American.  When Osama bin Laden blew up the Lusitania and started the War of the Roses, he didn't 
[01:02:00]  well count on Luke Skywalker blowing up the shuttle in the Bay of Pigs.  God bless the Canary Islands.  Seems like you're a little confused, sir.  Who?  You seem a little confused.  Who does?  You.  Who?  You.  Me?  Yes, you.  I hear Ronald Reagan's calling in.  No, you.  I hope I don't have to take a leak.  No, you're Ronald Reagan.  Hello?  Yes, Mommy.  Oh, I have to go. 
[01:02:30]  Mommy has to powder my behind. </pre>
