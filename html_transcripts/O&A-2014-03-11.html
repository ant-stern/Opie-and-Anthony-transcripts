<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The March 11, 2014, Opie and Anthony Show was a chaotic mix of controversial topics, listener calls, and video clips.  The broadcast opened with a heated discussion about the firing of Eastside Dave, a low-paid employee ($125-$150/week). Opie recounted a furious confrontation with his superior, Don Wicklund, over the decision, emphasizing his lack of prior knowledge and his efforts to prevent the firing.  This led to a broader discussion about the hosts' dwindling control over the show and its direction since Eric Logan's departure, expressing frustration with internal conflicts and poor communication.

The show then shifted to a lengthy segment speculating about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, exploring various theories ranging from mechanical failure and hijacking to the outlandish suggestion of alien abduction and referencing Stephen King’s "Langoliers."  Listener Alexandria contributed additional theories.

Next, the hosts launched into a graphic discussion and analysis of a Duke University student who had become a pornographic actress.  They played and commented extensively on explicit video clips, focusing on the actress's physical attributes and the sexual acts depicted, while questioning her reasons for entering the industry and her claim of needing the money for tuition.  They also discussed her father's reaction, noting he was an army physician returning from Afghanistan.  This segment was interspersed with a comedic "Weird Medicine" medical minute from Dr. Steve on bad breath, a 1990s song, and the announcement of Patton Oswalt as the following Friday's guest.


The show then moved to a segment focused on two distinct topics.  First, a highly offensive and satirical discussion of the "Ban Bossy" campaign ensued, employing racial slurs and misogynistic language to mock the initiative and its celebrity supporters (mentioning Jay-Z and Beyoncé).  The conversation broadened into a critique of political correctness and the banning of words deemed offensive.  The second part featured a call from Steve Irwin's cameraman detailing Irwin's death by stingray, correcting some media inaccuracies and describing his attempts to save Irwin.  This was punctuated by listener calls providing anecdotal information on stingrays and further offensive commentary from the hosts. One caller claimed Irwin's last words were "Slobo."


A subsequent segment centered around Vice documentaries. The hosts discussed a video featuring an underwhelming stand-up comedian performing under the influence of LSD, which then led to a discussion and the playing of clips from a 1950s video showing a housewife participating in an LSD experiment.  Their commentary throughout was filled with crude and sexually suggestive remarks. This transitioned into a lengthy clip from a Vice documentary about life as a truck stop stripper, including an interview with a disturbing trucker who recounted a self-inflicted gunshot wound and shared disturbing views on women. Listener calls detailed their own experiences at such establishments, including descriptions of unusual services and a possible drugging incident.  A caller criticized the show's increased reliance on video clips, sparking a debate about listener preferences and the show's format. The segment concluded with the playing of an Asia music video, previously mocked on the show, further discussion of the band's reaction, and a return to the Ambien-focused Vice documentary, featuring a clip of Ted Williams' reunion with his family on Dr. Phil.  The segment ended with a bizarre skit involving a prop representing a large bowel movement.


The penultimate segment featured Tom, a voiceover artist whose speech was severely affected by what seemed to be nerve damage after a wisdom teeth extraction.  The hosts and callers discussed his condition, the temporary alleviation of his symptoms with Ambien, and played clips showcasing the dramatic difference in his speech on and off the medication.  Graphic descriptions of Tom's physical sensations were included.  Steve offered a medical explanation focusing on nerve damage and Ambien's effects on the GABA system, while Brother Joe shared his experience with nerve-related sensations after a vasectomy.  Brief discussions of an upcoming show in Honduras, a canceled Frankie Faison interview (due to car trouble), Dr. Steve's explanation of the speed of light, Oscar Pistorius’ trial, George Zimmerman's book signing, the popularity of the Cosmos TV show, and the North Korean parliamentary elections rounded out the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, good morning everyone. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Broadcasting live Tuesday, March 11, 2014.  D-D-Doo, as they say.  Yeah.  D-D-Doo.  I got yelled at yesterday.  I ain't dealing with that shit, I'll tell you right the fuck now. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, don't say it on the air.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I love to talk about it on the air.  Don Wicklund is screaming in my face.  And now mentioning this will be another issue, but, you know.  I can't picture that.  Believe it or not, I've never seen Dandy Don Wicklund.  I don't do yelling anymore.  I mean, people like to bring it up and stuff,  but it's been a very long time now.  And he's yelling and screaming. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Was he?  Yeah.  In front of everybody, too.  I'm like, really?  Do an impression.  Oh, hell no.  Come on, I want to hear it.  Hell no.  No?  They let Eastside Dave go, and there's, like, some controversy.  Why?  Uh-huh.  So I tweeted over the weekend the reason why, which was told to me,  because, you know, all hell's breaking loose on Twitter,  and I'm getting all sorts of shit over the Eastside Dave firing.  Yeah.  So I go, hey, this is what I know.  Period.  Period.  No, we don't control our own channel, you idiots. 
[00:01:30]  We haven't controlled this channel since Eric Logan.  Isn't that pretty obvious to everybody at this point?  I would think.  Why don't you guys save him?  It's your channel.  You know, if you really fucking...  Ah, shut up.  Well, you know.  Yeah.  And then Don's trying to tell me that I agreed that it was a budgetary cut.  I'm like, it's not...  I didn't agree to that.  They were only paying him $150 or whatever it was a week. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I would never agree to that.  Didn't agree to it?  I didn't agree to anything.  I wanted him back.  I fought to get him back.  I'll be honest.  I didn't even know about it until it was already over.  No one discussed anything with me.  I had zero.  You know how I found out about it?  I had no idea.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  I mean, we already know I have zero.  Yeah.  I fought to bring him back so that, you know...  I love Dave.  And then it was told to me, well, we brought him back because you wanted him back.  I'm like, yeah, to fire him? 
[00:02:30]  That's stupid.  That's good, thanks.  At that point, you might as well not have brought him back.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard about it after it was all done.  But the point, we had a really good radio show yesterday, and I'm so done with the feeling  like shit after every other radio show.  Yeah.  Because all this weird, stupid, tiny drama crap that happens around here.  Save the drama for your mama, I say.  We had a really good show yesterday, and I'm walking down the hall, and I'm getting screamed 
[00:03:00]  at.  I'm like, get out of here.  What?  That ain't happening.  No.  I don't do screaming.  I don't care about that.  I realize finally how stupid screaming is, so I'm not going to do screaming.  Yeah.  So, whatever, man.  They got rid of Dave.  They obviously didn't like his show.  The writing's on the wall.  So, Eastside Dave can stop tweeting and everything.  The fact is, he obviously didn't like your show.  Yeah.  And we don't have control over that. 
[00:03:30]  No, we don't.  None.  Holy fuck.  Leave me out of it.  You know, if I'm getting shit, I'm going to at least get one tweet out there to tell you  exactly what I was told.  Exactly, by the way.  Yeah.  And if you're a hater, and you want to spin it, whatever.  I understand that.  There's no haters on Twitter, right?  You can tell the God's honest truth to somebody that doesn't like you, and they'll still spin  it.  That's what they do.  Everyone knows that. 
[00:04:00]  But at least I said what I had to with one simple tweet.  That was the facts.  And that's it.  You know, Dave was with us and the channel for over eight years.  But to have Don Wicklund yelling and screaming at me, get the fuck out of here.  I'd like to hear that.  That is not happening.  I'd like to hear that one.  Who are you?  Stop.  Donnie Wicklund.  And then some weird guilt trip.  I quit my job to work with you again. 
[00:04:30]  All right.  Congratulations.  What do you want me to say about that?  He said that?  Yes.  Man.  Yes.  And now this will be an issue because we brought it up in the air.  Certainly will.  I don't care.  Sam Roberts got some trouble about it.  How are we not supposed to talk about things on the air?  It's our job to talk about things on the air.  All of it.  Hey, guys.  Don't mention this on the air.  Really?  Did you say that for other people that you worked with?  Come on.  Yeah, but to do really good radio shows and then walk out of here feeling like shit over 
[00:05:00]  some silly, stupid drama crap.  Yeah.  I say save the drama.  What?  Wrong.  And, you know, they all have Twitter accounts.  Then explain yourself on Twitter.  Mm-hmm.  Why don't you go look at my mentions?  I get attacked for all this stuff all the time.  Yeah.  So if you're supposedly taking care of us and the channel, maybe you should go take  a peek every once in a while and see how brutal it was, and then maybe you could explain  yourself exactly, you know, what went down with Eastside Dave. 
[00:05:30]  Explain it to them.  The facts are easy.  I like Eastside Dave.  He's been with us a long fucking time.  I would have never agreed to getting rid of him over $150 a show.  $150 a show, though.  Yeah, it's embarrassing.  We have no, supposedly, we have no budget.  So why are these guys even working for us, then? 
[00:06:00]  They can't get anything done.  Oh, boy.  Seriously.  If we don't have a budget, then what's your job?  I say we bring back Steve Platter.  No?  What?  What happened?  He's a nice guy.  He's a good guy, yeah.  He's a cool guy.  He's fine.  And I'll say this.  You know, the channel has absolutely made improvements since Tim Sabian came aboard.  Absolutely.  The show sounds better.  I don't know.  Maybe he re-motivated us in some weird way.  Who knows?  But, fuck, enough of the stupid drama. 
[00:06:30]  I say save the drama.  Right, Anthony?  Shut up.  And he goes, I want to talk to you.  And we were walking out together.  So I'm like, what?  What?  If you have something to say, say it to both of us.  And then he waited until you were out of your shot.  And then he lost his mind.  Yeah, I saw that.  I saw that.  Well, I was just...  I was walking in front of you guys.  Yes.  And the diarrhea song was playing.  We were singing it.  But then we were in the hallway.  And you didn't want to be like, two, sing the diarrhea song. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  And then...  But you did hear me go, what do you want?  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  And then I was through the glass doors into the elevators.  Right.  So...  You didn't stop to help out?  Oh, that's when it happened.  And he didn't stop to help out?  I didn't know anything was happening to help.  I kept continuing on my journey to my vehicle.  Right.  Wow.  So...  He fucking...  He separated the herd.  Yeah, he did.  He fucking...  He did pull that lion move.  So that's all the facts, period. 
[00:07:30]  Period.  Yeah.  So if you want to keep tweeting and all that, I'm telling you the God's honest truth.  I think I'd start cracking up when Don Wicklund yells at you.  I was like, what are you...  Really?  I was just laughing.  I'd be like, come on, Don, stop.  What are you doing?  This is hilarious.  That ain't gonna fly.  No, huh?  No, I don't do yelling.  Never have.  I do the yelling.  No one yells at me.  Yeah.  All right.  Everyone knows that.  You should have yelled back.  Oh, God, no.  No?  No.  No return yelling?  No, I don't give a fuck about this anymore. 
[00:08:00]  No one knows it.  I don't care.  See?  He admitted.  I don't fucking care.  Enough to be yelled at screaming?  Yeah.  It's God.  So now this will be an issue.  I don't care, though, man.  Yeah.  I wasn't even going to talk about any of this on the air until you screamed in my face,  you dummy.  Oh.  Just leave me the fuck alone.  You think there'll be a problem now?  And praise us when we have a goddamn good radio show like we did yesterday. 
[00:08:30]  And all last week and the week before that.  But how many times have we been yelled at?  Yeah.  How are the guys who work, the bosses of the channel, worried about looking bad in front  of the fans?  Like, what do they care for?  They don't interact with the fans.  I don't know.  Yeah.  If someone didn't agree with my tweet, then you tweet.  What do you want from me?  You know, I felt like I had to say something.  People were just bombarding me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to say something.  You know, the haters took the opportunity to, you know, assume way too much. 
[00:09:00]  That's why I wrote that, too.  I was like, I have no idea.  I didn't hear anything until it was already a done deal.  I found out on Twitter that he said Dave was gone.  Because people get on all of us.  They're like, well, you know, your name's on the channel.  Why didn't you say that?  God, I'm fucking...  No one consulted me.  I can tell you, I didn't know.  And I love Dave.  I didn't know when his show was on.  I don't listen.  Yeah.  Nothing against Dave.  I like him a lot.  Honestly, I haven't heard his show in years. 
[00:09:30]  I haven't.  He's a talented guy.  I hope he figures it out.  But I haven't heard, you know, the show in years.  Yeah.  You know, we're not as close as we used to be.  Just because we just don't see each other.  Yeah.  It's not like the old days when he was on, you know, Rana Fez.  We all were seeing each other in the hallways.  Was that a sports show?  I know he did a sports show.  Is that the one it was on?  I guess.  I don't even know.  I know it was called that.  Anyway.  He's a fun, funny guy, though. 
[00:10:00]  I like Davey.  Yep.  Davey Mac.  I wish him nothing but the, you know, the best.  Yeah.  Nothing but the best.  But, you know, obviously, you know, they didn't really like the show.  Yeah.  That's obvious.  It should be obvious to Dave and everybody else.  Yes.  In the end, they didn't like his show.  When the channel head says they're taking your show off, it's very obvious he didn't like it.  Yeah.  That's very obvious.  Right.  When he says, I'll put it back on, it doesn't come back on.  Oh.  I'm just saying.  You know.  Somehow, I think we're speaking about something else right now. 
[00:10:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  I just like plain, honest English.  Tell me you don't like something if you don't like it.  That's all.  Anyway.  I liked.  Yeah, no, I appreciate that.  I'm sure you did.  I liked that.  Yes.  I would drive home on Wednesdays and I would listen.  Well, your opinion has no say.  Apparently not.  No.  Yeah.  No, we don't run the channel.  We have no say in it.  We certainly don't.  I would, you know, we had ideas in the early days.  Yeah.  We wanted to give all our friends, you know, a spot and stuff.  They really did kind of take any say we have away from us. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Like, all of a sudden, we have no say on this channel.  Not really.  I mean.  We did, though.  We used to have a say.  Well, we fought for stuff and we got some things.  We got the, you know, the channel change.  Yeah.  I think pre-Tim and Donnie Wicklin, we had a lot more fucking say what happens in this room  than we do now.  And that's an absolute.  I don't know about that.  We were able to say, just the fact that Jimmy had his advice show. 
[00:11:30]  We didn't get anything done with the other guys.  No, but we were able to say, hey, we want this guy on on Saturday or we want, you know,  we want to put one of our buddy's fucking podcasts on or something.  Now, it's being a little more micromanaged than it used to.  We don't have any say what goes on the air anymore.  We don't have a say.  Yeah.  Yeah?  I don't think so.  We got to figure some shit out.  Do you think we'll get all yelled at?  I'm not re-motivated by it. 
[00:12:00]  I was always motivated to do the show.  I was never not motivated to do the show.  I love coming on the show.  Right.  Doing the show is the fun part of being, like, that's the least bad part of that work.  Like, doing the show is fun.  There's been some weird motivation.  Everyone has heard it out there that the show sounds better for whatever reason.  So, maybe it's the extra sleep, half hour.  Maybe.  You know, it could be the extra.  Maybe.  That was a biggie for me.  Sleepy.  That was something I knew would help me a lot.  So, who knows? 
[00:12:30]  So, that's what's going on.  Will you grab?  No.  Oh, boy.  No, I told you what I wanted.  I wanted to bring him back.  And I actually said I want to bring him back because Tim is a radio guy.  Maybe he could figure out, you know, how to make Dave's show better.  That was one of the reasons why I did want it to happen.  Because someone like Tim could help Dave.  And what is on, on Saturday night, that is better than that?  Even if they didn't like the show, what are we doing that's better than Dave's show? 
[00:13:00]  More replays and stuff.  Oh, really?  Yeah, the replays are good.  More of us.  I kind of liked, you know, new original content.  I mean, regardless, I don't think Saturday night is the huge listening window for this channel.  They don't really have the budget for it, so.  $125.  $150.  $125.  $125 is doable.  $125.  That's downright embarrassing.  It is.  Silly me.  We literally have no budget.  So, they're going to save that much money. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because that's the official answer, I guess, that it's budget.  I don't even know what the official answer is anymore, because I was told one thing.  Who told you that?  Don was yelling that it was a budgetary thing.  Oh, Don was yelling, right.  That I agreed to.  Why would I agree to save $600 a month or whatever it would be?  That's ridiculous.  Don's a lead singer.  He could probably yell pretty good.  Did he have range to it?  Was it on key?  No?  Great. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, my God.  All the people that tweet me about the advice show, I'm not in charge of it.  I'm not the channel boss.  I have no say in it.  No?  So, you're tweeting the wrong guy.  No say?  Yeah.  What do you want me to tell you?  Man.  This is, uh, doing this is becoming exhausting, to be honest with you.  It's becoming exhausting.  Well, obviously, if we don't have any say.  No, it's becoming exhausting, because there's a lot, there's a lot of shitty radio at SiriusXM. 
[00:14:30]  A lot.  Yeah.  And we're one of the better shows.  I like to think, you know, well, I'm not going to pull a you-know-who.  But we're right the fuck up there as one of the better shows here at SiriusXM.  Right.  And we get the most shit.  Constantly.  Constantly.  There's always an issue, because people's feelings get hurt.  Feelings shmeelings.  That's my technical jargon.  We get the most shit, and this is becoming a drag. 
[00:15:00]  It's not worth it.  Why don't we walk out of here after doing a good show and get yelled at seriously?  And what does it do in the end?  Well, it gives us 20, 30 minutes of material the next day.  No, no.  We're not supposed to talk about it, though.  That's true.  Don't talk about it.  Keep your yaps shut.  Yeah, and I'll talk about the meeting stuff on it.  I know there's guys who run the channel, but what about what fans want to hear? 
[00:15:30]  Fans schmans.  Well, I mean, Eastside Dave certainly had supporters, but it wasn't like a, you know, a huge buzz,  to be completely honest with you.  So, he had his audience.  Right.  I don't know.  I just think until you have something viable, why take anyone off? 
[00:16:00]  Why do anything until you have an option?  Yeah.  Oh, the budget.  150 bucks.  Right.  150 big ones.  Yep.  Simoleons.  Clams.  Clamolas.  Bucks.  And, you know, that's why when they come to me with these ideas, too, I don't really  try hard or listen to them.  And they get frustrated because...  It never comes to fruition.  Well, we wanted to go to L.A., and then, of course, you know, it's too expensive to go 
[00:16:30]  to L.A.  And I thought to myself, of course it's going to be too expensive to go to L.A., so why  are we even discussing it?  It's more than 150 bucks.  We'll just sit here and...  I think that's the budget.  We'll sit here, continue to do a really good radio show.  We've been rotting here for, what, it's up to about four years now, just rotting.  What a good rot.  You know, when we were at just XM, they spent money in a ridiculous way.  I mean, they spent it the other way way too much and silly. 
[00:17:00]  Somewhere in the middle would be nice.  Yeah.  You know.  They did throw some money away over there, didn't they?  They sure did.  Yeah.  We would have been going to L.A., trust me, if it was just XM, because they didn't give  a fuck.  They just spent crazy amounts of money.  Crazy amounts of money.  How much did they think it was going to cost to send a whole radio show cross-country for  a week to do...  30 bucks.  To do promotion, by the way.  To do a couple live shows and a bunch of promotion.  Yeah.  It's like, you want the show promoted?  You want to just keep promoting it on this platform?  People who are hearing this have the service. 
[00:17:30]  Are they preaching to the converted?  Yes.  Or the choir?  I like the choir better.  I like the choir.  Because the converted implies they once did not believe.  That's true.  The choir implies it's always been.  But I just don't have the time to waste anymore having two kids.  So when they come to me with these ideas that I know in my heart of hearts that it's not  going to happen, I don't want to spend...  I don't want to waste time discussing it.  As soon as they mentioned the L.A. trip, you heard me.  Did you know?  I just knew that there's no way. 
[00:18:00]  I got my little monitor.  All right.  I feel good about that.  So now they're going to try to find a sponsor, I guess, so we could go to L.A.?  They should have done that all along.  But that's common sense.  That's how everything works in radio.  It's supposed to, anyway.  Yes.  You do.  You find a sponsor.  You get sales involved.  They pay for it.  We say, hey, this trip is brought to you by...  Right.  Kellogg's.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:18:30]  Maybe they could send us on Malaysian air.  That would be nice.  What the hell is that playing?  A little disappearing act.  That's great.  Was this Criss Angel?  Is Criss Angel responsible for this?  They're starting to say they're not going to find this playing.  They're just not going to find it.  But no one on all these news channels, I was watching all night long, none of them could  come up with a good explanation why it completely disappears like this.  No one brought up aliens yet?  Not one person could explain how a plane can completely disappear without a trace. 
[00:19:00]  But how do trains disappear?  That's what I want to know.  Well, we've got to call Rich for that.  Yeah.  And what's this cell phone's ringing or something theory?  What?  I don't know.  What paper was it in?  Let's see.  A cell phone?  Lots of cell phones.  What?  I don't know.  We're ringing where?  I've got to find the article.  Uh-oh.  Give me the other paper.  That sounds creepy.  Well, they've got theories.  They're listing the theories in the paper today. 
[00:19:30]  Oceanic?  Give me the top paper.  That one, yeah.  They're all the same.  These stupid rags.  But, let's see.  Few clues, but many theories.  Hijacking.  Of course.  So where is it?  Catastrophic mid-air failure of the plane's engines or structure, such as its frame or wings.  Oh, boy.  A bombing.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Pilot suicide.  Oh, boy.  But that guy loved flying, man.  Yeah.  Plus, wouldn't they have seen it going down on radar?  I think the radar would have had an altitude change.  Right.  It would have just disappeared.  Unless maybe he turned off his transponder.  You could do that, too.  Oh, right.  That might do it.  Is that how they track it, completely with the transponder?  No.  If you're close to tracking stations, they can track it, like if you're close to land or  an airport or something like that, or one of their stations.  But if you're over the ocean, I think the transponder is pretty much the only way to tell 
[00:20:30]  where you are.  Is radar.  Radar?  Yeah.  Yeah, they said they have to depend on radar still a lot, even though we have all this  new technology, they still really depend on the radar more than anything.  And then, finally, well, I said a missile attack, and then you got They're Alive, the  ringing cell phone theory.  Oh, no.  What's that?  A blog post on the Chinese government's China.org.cn site reported that 19 families signed a joint 
[00:21:00]  statement requesting Malaysian Air, Malaysia Airlines, to explain why they could get through  to their family members' cell phones, but they could not hear anything, and the calls  hung up.  They submitted the telephone numbers to the airline, which failed to respond to their  questions with active measures, according to the site.  Wow.  False flag operation.  But it's not that.  If they could make a plane disappear, what do you think, they're going to trip up on their  cell phones? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Like, they would do something with those phones.  They would make sure that they...  Oh, they would take everyone's cell phones.  Yeah.  I guess you're just, you know...  Of course, if you lost your loved one, and you don't know where the fuck they are, you're  going to call their cell phone.  Yeah, you're hoping.  So, I mean, they're not hearing voices or anything.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Some phones and networks begin ringing immediately on the caller's end before they've even established  a signal.  So, that's what they're saying is happening.  Of course. 
[00:22:00]  It's not really ringing.  Not the phones, right.  But...  You're just hearing it.  That's creepy.  But people will run with that, and it'll be a nice little theory.  It's very Twilight Zone-ish.  For everybody.  Fucking crash in the ocean somewhere.  They'll figure it out.  It was either a bomb or...  The wings snapped.  Water landing.  Ship sunk in one piece.  No debris.  Couple of life rafts with people in it.  Just going like...  Really?  Siffling.  No.  No.  No.  Crap.  Why couldn't the wings snap?  The wings never snap. 
[00:22:30]  Never.  So, why couldn't that happen once?  There would be too much stuff that would still be floating around.  It would be.  There should be something floating around.  And that strip of water is not any bigger than anywhere else that they have found planes  before.  Right.  You know?  It's a little strip of water they had to fly over.  It's not that vast.  It's land.  It doesn't look...  And it's only 200 feet deep?  600, I heard.  600?  I heard 600, but...  Let's say 350.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  Why would the pilot turn the transponder off if he was going to commit suicide?  Like, if he killed his co-pilot, hit him with a fucking whatever, why do you turn  the transponder off?  Who cares?  You're driving into the...  You're flying into the ocean.  To have no evidence that he did that.  Probably.  They would know where it is.  They'd get the black box.  They might hear some voice shit.  You know?  If they're lost, that's another thing.  Maybe he turns the transponder off.  If he flies so far off course before he fucking ditches it, that they don't even know where  the fuck the plane is. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Can you turn the black box off or no?  I don't think so, no.  I don't think you can do that.  No, I think that's...  Yeah.  That's embedded deep into the plane, isn't it?  Yeah, that's not...  You'd have to chisel that shit out.  Discretion.  Yeah, I don't think so.  What the hell is this plane, though?  It's a whole big fucking plane, and it just disappeared.  But, yeah.  The Earth's kind of big.  No, but, I mean, look.  You look at the map here.  They only have to search in, like, a quarter inch.  You have to search just right here. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  A quarter inch.  Come on.  You know, find a couple of helicopters could...  Yeah.  Search that area.  And there should be some debris.  Some debris.  Yeah, right.  You think something would be floating.  Yeah.  Anything.  If a plane crashes into the ocean, there's got to be something, regardless of how it came  down in a fuckload of pieces or one solid piece, there'd be something.  And who's this Mr. Ali?  Ah, that's the terrorist angle. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Some Iranian with a stolen passport.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  No, hunt for Mr. Ali ticket...  Oh, he was one of the ticket buyers.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow, that's a horrible fake name.  Mr. Ali, you don't like that one?  No.  I think he tried, but Frank Baum got fledged.  Frank Baum.  Why don't you go with, like, John Huston or...  Yeah, yeah.  Jerry Mathers or...  Something like that, yes.  Why would you go with Mr. Ali? 
[00:25:00]  That's like...  I am Mr. Ali.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Ding, ding.  It has to be.  Red flag.  Or maybe that's, like, an extremely normal name in that area of the world.  Maybe.  Maybe that's, like, a Bob Smith over there.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Might not translate like a terrorist in Malaysian.  And they said they were bought back-to-back, those tickets.  Like, both bought in a row.  They're sequentially...  It's, like, you know, 107 or 108.  So, with two separate stolen passports...  At different times from Thailand. 
[00:25:30]  At different times, they bought tickets right after each other.  Right before and right after.  Yeah.  Wow, that...  Okay, that seems a little suspicious.  So, it's either terrorism or it's just a thing that people over there use to travel  when they have a problem traveling.  So, maybe one guy gets a couple of people on...  I don't know how it...  Well, they already figured out who one of them is.  It's in the news this morning.  He's a student, right?  Yeah, he was seeking asylum in Germany.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  His mother was waiting for him.  Which is...  Oh, boy.  He's just going to wait a while.  I think they said it's relatively normal in that area to have stolen passports and stuff. 
[00:26:00]  That's great to know.  But one of the experts said that to have two on one plane, that's not even close to normal.  And a back-to-back buying...  Right.  Yeah, well...  They said you'll get one every once in a while, but not two on one flight.  That's where the...  Where, you know, it raises the eyebrows.  19-year-old Iranian.  Oh, boy.  That doesn't sound good.  Yeah, just because his mother was waiting.  He's not going to call his mom and go, look, I'm blowing the plane up.  I can't...  Right.  Terrorist.  They'll find it. 
[00:26:30]  They identified both of them.  Very hard to completely disappear.  A giant plane like that.  So they got the passengers with the stolen passports.  They've been identified.  So now it's just a matter of looking into their background.  Right.  Yeah.  They'll put the pieces together for this mysterious puzzle.  Bunch of ships out there trying to fucking find it.  Right.  Man.  And don't they got those beacons that are just beep, beep, somewhere?  Beep.  I heard the batteries on those things last like 30 days.  They got like 30 days. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, the beacon for the plane?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you'd think that thing would be chirping away.  I'm a pilot.  You're wrong.  You're not on radar over the ocean.  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  But they depend on radar more than any of the other technologies out there.  Over land, yeah.  Right.  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, once you're 120 miles off the coast, they no longer have you on radar.  We use radio.  It's almost $1 for every mile of Dave's pay. 
[00:27:30]  Use what?  We use radio, high-frequency radio.  We call back to land, and we give our position, and we say, this is our next position, and  we're going to be at that next position at this time.  They can't track you at satellite?  No.  It's too expensive.  What about the transponder?  What about those apps where you go on the computer, and you see all those little...  You see the planes everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  You see where they all are.  That's all...  Once you're over water, over land, it's accurate.  Over water, it's just a guess.  The pilot reports his position.  So if he doesn't report it accurately or in time, then they go back to your last known 
[00:28:00]  position.  Oh, I got it.  They just expect if you left point A, and you're going to point B, and this much time  went by, and you're doing this speed, they assume you're there.  Exactly.  And the transponder, all the transponder does is talk to the radar.  But if you don't have radar to see the transponder, the transponder's worthless.  All right.  But they weren't even 120 miles out, right?  It was only like 90 miles.  They were further enough off so that the transponder was not invisible, but they have  search radar, which is what military uses, and that is not as accurate as transponder 
[00:28:30]  locations.  Oh, okay.  You'd think they would have found this by now, though, right?  Wait, they're only 90 miles off the coast?  I think so, yeah.  How do you think?  If you turn the transponder off, you can fly as far as you want, and without them catching  you on radar, if you're low enough.  But if you're only 90 miles off the coast, you know, a quick zigzag by a few jets, you're  going to find something.  Should be, unless you went low enough to go far enough away that they're not looking.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  They would expand their looking. 
[00:29:00]  Their looky-loo.  You would think.  Yeah, you would think.  What if they landed in the NOM or something?  Nice, right?  Fucking offloaded everybody, holding them prisoner, sex slaves.  Ooh.  Ball flag.  They'd probably say that.  A pilot guy.  So, if it was a hijacking, there's no way they could turn off everything so they could  fly to where they want to fly mysteriously, right?  Yeah, you could turn off the transport.  Back in 9-11, what the terrorists did, they turned the transponder off. 
[00:29:30]  What happened then?  And they flew south.  And you're not able to track, in current radar, you're not able to track them without  the transponder unless you go back to the old-style radar where you're setting a beam  and getting a return off to the hull of the aircraft.  We don't use that a lot anymore because it's old technology.  So, they could, in essence, it's a long shot, but they could have turned off the transponder,  gone low, and landed somewhere in, like, the jungles of the NOM.  They could, yeah. 
[00:30:00]  But there's an impossibility that that happened.  Right.  First of all, you can't get into the cockpit.  Second of all, for what?  I think I'm going with aliens.  I mean, if the pilot was doing it.  If the pilot himself was doing it for some reason.  I'm going aliens.  What the hell?  I'm going aliens.  What are the odds on aliens?  Bigfoot.  We got this Vegas thing happening yet?  What are the odds on aliens?  Aliens is at 6 billion to 1.  Could be the opening for the new Godzilla movie.  That's true.  Although, that's Japan, not China. 
[00:30:30]  Could be a great, I know, but close enough, and I think it would be great.  Close enough.  I think it would be great marketing for the new movie.  Yeah.  What the hell?  All right, Tom.  Thanks for your knowledge.  All right.  Plutch it out.  All right.  This guy has theories.  Let's say hi to Alex in Indiana.  Alex.  Hi, I'm the other guy.  Thank you.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hello, whoa, whoa.  That says a vagina.  How are you guys doing?  Hi, Alex.  Is it Alexis?  It's Alexandria.  Oh, that's Alexandria.  I like that. 
[00:31:00]  Good morning, Alexandria.  It's delightful.  It sounds classy.  Don't be bossy, all right?  Just make your phone call.  Don't be bossy over here.  Oh, we'll get into that shit.  Oh, we certainly will.  I don't like that word.  You more banning of words.  Get out of here.  I don't like it.  You fucking bitches.  They're right.  Are they?  They should consider themselves lucky if they're called bossy.  You know what we can come up with as men?  I know, right?  Cunt.  Yes.  That's the best one.  I was keeping it a little vague.  It's cute and nice for everybody. 
[00:31:30]  No, no.  Let's just get to the point.  Hey, Alex, what are your expertise that you have any theory on this?  My theory, two theories.  Oh, well, forget it.  Langoliers and Stephen King.  Yes, Langoliers.  You think they're stuck in between time?  Whoa.  Yeah, they flew through one of those clouds and then it went into yesterday.  Craig.  Yeah, and then a gigantic mutant sea monster made even worse by all that radiation coming  out of Fukushima.  I made the Godzilla joke already.  Hey, hey. 
[00:32:00]  It's possible.  It really is possible.  It is.  All right.  That's my man.  It's very dangerous.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  You too.  Langoliers.  No one talks about Langoliers.  I don't know that one.  It was a Stephen King, one of those TV movies that were put out that are really terrible,  but I think Balky was in it.  Was it one of his 12-hour TV shows or was it one of his 8,000-page books?  It went on and on. 
[00:32:30]  It was horrible CGI special effects where the textures didn't look good at all.  Yeah.  The book was great, though.  Langoliers?  Yeah.  It's where they fly into yesterday.  Yeah, they kind of are stuck waiting for time to catch up to them.  And the past, apparently, when you go through time, the past is eaten by these things, Langoliers,  and they destroy and eat and dispose of the past, but they were kind of stuck there.  So you look down when they're flying and they see big pieces of the country are just black missing 
[00:33:00]  and these giant things chewing through it.  They're eating it.  Whoa.  And they land in an airport.  I eat it.  What if they can't hear?  There's no echoes or something?  It's really good.  Yeah, yeah.  The sound isn't good.  Things don't taste right.  Like, everything was a little off.  It was a pretty brilliant concept.  It was.  I watched it.  I liked it.  But it was another cheap production.  Any of those TV movies that Stephen King does, oh, they're just awful.  Like The Stand miniseries.  Oh.  It wasn't good.  Sorry.  All right.  We're just getting started.  We'll talk more about this plane thing. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Also, we've got to talk about the Duke student there, the co-ed.  If you're into cheap thrills, the Daily News today, page three, you could actually see  razor stubble on her area.  Fuck.  Look at that.  They didn't hairbrush that out.  She's clean shaven down below, and she's, like, pulling her panties down slightly.  And you could see all the razor stubble where hair is supposed to be.  I love this girl.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  You see her little cutting scars? 
[00:34:00]  No.  Oh, wow.  On her thigh by her fingertips.  Yeah, I see it.  Yeah.  I like a troubled girl.  Oh, who doesn't?  The father's not happy.  No, the poor dad.  We'll get into that whole thing.  Yeah, please.  It's perfect.  And we'll get into the whole band bossy thing.  Yeah.  Which is completely ridiculous.  Crazy bitches.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Beyonce is out of her mind.  Michelle Obama is out of her mind.  Is she chimed in?  No way she chimed in.  I believe she did, yes. 
[00:34:30]  Can you get all the band bossy stuff for us, Sam?  Please.  All the fun tweets about it.  Maybe you get one of our interns or E-Rock or somebody to just go through the band bossy hashtag  because all the female celebrities are getting involved.  Yeah.  It's so stupid.  What are we doing to this country?  You can't ban words.  Bossy is a problem now.  Yeah.  Well, what it's used for a girl...  Now we'll get into the whole thing.  But first, this.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will be right back. 
[00:35:00]  On Sirius XM.  Dash is screaming, but we're more.  Hey, this is Dr. Steve from Weird Medicine with another Dr. Steve Medical Minute.  Medical Minute.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  No matter what I do, my breath smells like a fried turd.  What can I do?  Well, you're describing a condition called halitosis, or in your case, fried turd breath.  Chronic bad breath affects millions of people in the world and is defined as awful breath  that can't be fixed with simple brushing or mouthwash. 
[00:35:30]  It's estimated 90% of the problems occur inside the mouth.  Bacteria in the mouth break down proteins that release sulfur compounds into the atmosphere.  And sulfur is the element that contributes to the delightful smell of farts.  So you can imagine what this does coming out of your mouth.  Causes of flatus breath include plaque buildup, broken down dental work, dry mouth, or bacterial  growth on the back part of the tongue.  Some people have tonsil nuggets or tonsillists that can make your breath smell like something 
[00:36:00]  from the nether regions of hell.  The other 10% of cases are caused by sinus infections, reflux of stomach acid, or problems  with the liver, kidneys, or pancreas.  A dentist can help you with this and will refer you to a medical provider if no dental problem  is found.  In the meantime, you can always simply chew gum.  Although it is considered unprofessional in some circles and can contribute to jaw pain  and problems with dental work, it can keep your breath under control.  until you can be seen by your dentist to get things started.  Be sure to check out Weird Medicine, Saturdays at 10 p.m. Eastern, right here on the Opie 
[00:36:30]  and Anthony Channel.  Go ahead.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on SiriusXM.  Oh, I like this one.  Remember the edit? 
[00:37:00]  I want a...  Like an animal.  I want to...  This has 90s written all over, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We listened to this one in my college dorm.  The crazy videos.  As a freshman.  Those nightmarish videos they used to put out in the 90s. 
[00:37:30]  Yep.  What?  Yeah, they put out crazy videos in the 90s.  No, the freshman left.  What are you talking about?  I want a...  On the oldies station that really rocks.  This song came out in 1994.  All right.  So, that's about right.  You said you were a freshman in college in 1994.  You might want to clean your ears, Sam.  What are you talking about?  Yes, with a shotgun.  I want a...  Remember that when then, like, television commercials would come out and they would kind of try to 
[00:38:00]  look like 90s videos.  Yeah.  With that soft focus around the edges and kind of very contrasty, almost looking like a Nirvana  video.  Yeah, they came...  And it was like a commercial for insurance.  I know.  You knew it was over at that point.  Yeah, but the rap thing did the same.  Rap did it.  Same thing.  Now the thing is...  Rap thing did the same thing.  Now the thing is to have your commercial look like a Vine video or something.  Right.  Everyone's just talking to their, like, camera. 
[00:38:30]  It's about toothpaste and someone's got their arm extended like they're holding their phone.  I brush with Chris.  It's like all this...  Everything that's hip and new and now.  And then you know it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  It's just done-ski.  Oh, Patton Oswalt is going to be in studio Friday.  Nice.  It's been a while.  He's a fun guy.  Love you, Mr. Patton.  Okay, wait.  Let's call up...  No.  No.  Not today.  All right.  Yeah.  Yes, an old-fashioned love swung. 
[00:39:00]  We kind of talked about it for a second, but I think we're going to get her on the show,  too.  The Duke girl.  Yes.  The Duke blue devil.  I'm so infatuated.  B-L-E-W devil.  Man.  That's what they're called.  Are they?  They're the blue devil, so...  She needed the money, and she did.  Dad returned.  This is like every dad's nightmare.  This is...  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Do we have that clip?  Hardcore with the... 
[00:39:30]  George C. Scott.  George C. Scott.  Yes.  That's another movie that turns into a comedy after a while.  Yep.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Oh, God.  This is every dad's nightmare.  Jesus.  Well, it's not like he was overseas in Afghanistan fighting for his country as a doctor.  Assuming everything was okay at home.  Oh, boy.  Dad returns from Afghanistan to learn his kid is Duke porn star.  Wow.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[00:40:00]  Boy, that's true.  A U.S. Army physician came home from a tour in Afghanistan to find that his little princess  had turned into a porn star.  Oh, sexy.  Devout Catholic doctor, Kevin Weeks.  That name sounds really familiar.  Do we know a Kevin Weeks?  Huh?  I feel like I know a Kevin Weeks.  It's probably not the same Kevin Weeks.  But I'm not even sure if I know a Kevin Weeks.  It just seems a bit familiar.  Sounds familiar.  Ah, Kevin Weeks.  Was stunned by the news, but told relatives he and his wife are still supportive of Miriam. 
[00:40:30]  Well.  Miriam.  Her name's Miriam?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  What a horrible name.  That's this young girl's name, Miriam?  Let me look at her picture while I think Miriam.  Oh, Miriam.  Ew.  She is so sexy.  She's amazing.  Oh, I love her.  Aren't she a big pussy, too?  Have you seen it?  Oh, yes, I have.  Is it big?  In movies, it's big fat.  Ooh.  She's.  Yes.  I think she's Anthony's type all the way.  Oh, of course she is.  Damaged goods.  Ah, this is a tragedy in the family. 
[00:41:00]  Tragedy.  Amanda Minor, the mother-in-law of Miriam's brother Paul told the Daily Mail,  the father is one of the best human beings I've ever met.  Certainly is.  See, this is what scares the shit out of a lot of us pops and fathers out there.  You do everything proper, and it still turns out like this.  Well, if she was cutting and stuff, what's happened?  What happened back in here?  He is just back from Afghanistan.  He served his country.  How awesome is that?  Minor said that Dr. Weeks, based out of Spokane, I guess, remains so proud of his daughter, 
[00:41:30]  there's no way they could have known this was going on.  Of course not.  It's terrible.  But they would never abandon their daughter.  This is a nightmare, what the family's going through.  I'm just looking at naked pictures of her.  That's fucking beautiful.  Oh, she's a sexy girl right there.  Girl next door, look, is what she got.  Apparently her dad, oh boy, how fucking, you don't want, you don't want. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, God, I feel for that father.  Oh, look, Paul's deep in his little girl.  Oh, wow.  She has a nice small head.  Oh, boy.  Look at her teeny head.  Oh, my God.  She has a head like Denny.  Fucking Denny head.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  Oh, my God.  You think they could have come up with a 50 large for her?  You think if the dad knew the option was her doing porno, or you come up with 50 large 
[00:42:30]  for college, that he would have found some way to come up with it?  Well, the bullshit in this story is the fact that she's saying she couldn't afford college.  She wants to be doing this for other reasons.  Yeah.  For attention.  She likes the attention, and yeah, there's a bit of fame involved here as well.  She's not just doing it to pay for college.  That's so obvious after the interview she did with Piers Morgan.  She loves it.  She likes doing porn.  She likes the attention.  Loves the dick.  Because the money is shit, really.  Yeah.  It's only $1,200 a scene. 
[00:43:00]  I mean, you've got to do, what, 40-some-odd scenes to pay for the college.  Oh, no.  We figured it out.  It was more than 50 Gs, right?  Yeah.  It was like 65 when it's all said and done.  Yep.  So that's the bullshit in the story that there's some innocent girl that is doing this because  she couldn't make tuition at Duke.  Yeah.  No.  The cutting shows you she likes attention.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a biggie right there.  I want to see.  Can you find a cab, Sam?  I want to see what that looks like.  Oh, my God.  Of course.  Thank you, Josh.  The goaltender is Kevin Weeks. 
[00:43:30]  There's a goaltender named Kevin Weeks.  I knew I knew that name.  Okay.  Different guy, though.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's right.  I'm home.  I'm finally home.  I was...  God, Afghanistan was so rough.  Oh, did I see some terrible things over there, but...  Wow, it's so nice to wake up in my own bed. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, I got my...  My loving families here.  My wife.  Children.  Oh, Miriam.  It's so nice to see my...  Wait.  Wait, what?  There's something...  Oh, my God.  My daughter's a porn star.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, it's just...  It's fine for a few seconds right when he wakes up.  Every morning.  And then every morning it hits him like a ton of fucking bricks.  Bulls deep.  She's a dirty girl, too, man.  Yeah.  She fucking...  Every porno I've seen is just not like one of those...  Like, oh, it's just some amateur.  She's good at what she does.  She's getting choked.  Big loads in the face.  Wow.  What, you seen some scenes already? 
[00:45:00]  I've seen every scene.  Scene.  Scene.  It's perfect.  When does...  So good.  When does Duke say get lost?  Take a hike, ski?  They can't.  How can they?  It's a legal way to make a living.  That is true.  But they're in the, you know, we both agree that I should take some time off stage.  They do not want her back at Duke.  Stop it.  I'm the nerve of them.  How about they fucking have the same thing on their athletes?  How about they have their athletes?  Any other athletes that have been arrested for any type of a felony?  How about they worry about that instead of a girl sucking dick for a living? 
[00:45:30]  Jesus.  This is a little more...  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy.  You guys were right.  I do like her.  Look at that.  Oh, boy.  That is a giant cock she's sucking right there.  Wowee.  Jesus.  She's a good girl.  She is such a good girl right there.  Oh, the curtains get closed like...  Oh, boy.  Wow.  She has a great vagina.  You like it, right?  It's more than I like my next breath.  Perfect.  Do you think my face looks good next to your big cock? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Welcome home, pops.  Welcome home.  I guarantee her dad would see this and he'd love it.  Is she okay?  She has sweatpants on with a big hole cut where it should be cut.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you've been to me.  The guy can't even put his cock in all the way.  No.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:46:30]  It's literally going in about a quarter of the way.  Yeah, a quarter of the way.  30% of the way.  Wow.  She's lovely.  She's on her back.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  She is taking a lot of dick right there.  Yeah.  Holy shit, King.  He falls deep in her.  Wow.  Fucking pounded her.  His feet are up on the bed.  He's kneeling on the other thing.  He's putting it in.  He's pulling it out.  He's putting it in.  He's pulling it out.  His balls are jiggling.  Jiggles.  Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.  She's looking up.  His balls are jiggling.  In and out. 
[00:47:00]  In and out.  Her asshole's opening up a lot.  It's opening up like it's winking.  Oh, she's holding her leg now.  Her hand's on her leg.  Oh, God.  He's behind her.  Why is she doing that?  She must have fuzz on her pussy or something because she's rubbing fuzz off the clip.  In and out.  In and out.  In and out.  Out and in.  And out and in and out.  And he's holding her hiney.  He's rubbing her hiney.  Hiney.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He's putting it all the way in there.  God.  That she's taking that must feel so good.  Being up on your hands and knees like that with that thing.  I mean, forget it. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, he's going to.  Is he going?  Yeah, he went down there.  I guess.  He's right in there.  I guess there's a turd sticking out.  She's a good girl.  Oh, my God.  This guy's packing probably 10 inches and she is really being taught a lesson.  She is absorbing it.  Yeah.  So just to pay for college, right?  Oh, boy.  But that's my genetic competition.  Thank God I'm funny.  Because that's what I'm competing with. 
[00:48:00]  You think the dad watched this?  How could he not?  And then stand up and wonder what that tent was.  Jesus.  I don't care who you are.  This is fantastic.  Oh, look at that.  She's got a fucking nice ass on her.  Her vagina is perfect.  Yeah.  Wow.  How come I'm not showing the guy's face, Bang?  I love that.  Maybe because it's not important, but I mean, I love the fact that guys are just so replaceable.  Right?  It's just his dick.  That's all they need in this movie. 
[00:48:30]  Don't you get, like, educational benefits or something if you're a big wig in the army?  I would think, maybe.  I think she just really enjoys it.  Yeah, I think you're right.  Yeah, getting fucked.  But this guy's actually being nice to her.  This guy's actually being nice to her.  He's not trying to wreck her.  You can see he's, you know, trying to be somewhat gentle.  He's a good one.  Is she coming in?  Supposedly.  When is she coming in next week?  Look at that.  Oh, boy. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, boy.  I want to be this man.  Who wouldn't?  The control these guys have is fucking staggering.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, man.  Wow.  For those of you who can't see it, picture civil rights footage in the mid-60s.  Wow.  You think the dad saw that part?  Yes.  More than once.  As hot as all that is.  Yeah.  What's sad is that, you know, people are looking at this going, she had to do this to pay for 
[00:49:30]  her college.  Stop it.  Which makes her parents look like scumbags.  Right.  You know, she's killing her parents in more ways than one by bullshitting to everybody that  she's doing this because she had to pay for tuition.  She wants to be a porn star.  Yeah.  She likes the attention.  You know, when you hear the story, it sounds like there's a desperation there.  Yep.  And that's all bullshit. 
[00:50:00]  Gosh.  It just is.  She's sexy, man.  I hate the vague title they gave it.  Slim Tiny Teen Girl Gets Destroyed by Massive Cock.  It's a great movie, too.  I want that in 3D, and I want J.J. Abrams to direct it.  Too much lens flare on the helmet.  Of course.  Are these videos getting some hits because she's famous?  Wow.  Dude, her vag is fucking amazing.  For a girl that age, that's amazingly lucky.  Slim girl.  It's really big and puffy. 
[00:50:30]  Good.  That is nice.  Yeah.  She's lovely.  Follow her on Twitter?  No.  For what?  I don't know.  She doesn't follow me.  I don't know.  You see pictures of her.  That's terrific.  She posts little pictures of herself.  Maybe she doesn't know who you are yet, maybe.  That's fair.  That's true.  I'm not obsessed with you.  Maybe she would love to follow you.  I hear you.  Oh, it said Duke will suspend athletes for shenanigans.  Okay.  Shenanigans.  But I don't think that that's a crime to do porn.  It's a legal profession. 
[00:51:00]  It's a legal occupation.  It is.  Well, when you're running a fine university like Duke.  Yeah, you don't want that kind of distraction.  It's not good for recruiting.  Well, didn't they have that problem with that lacrosse?  Oh, every university and college has their problems, obviously.  Yeah.  But this one is so front and center.  It's kind of an embarrassment for the whole university.  Again, it is legal.  And she's of age.  Mm-hmm.  She won't be back to Duke, though. 
[00:51:30]  She's got a nice little career for herself.  Then she'll write a book about her sexploits.  And I'll buy it.  Yeah.  Yes.  She'll do very well for herself, I'm sure.  But to say, she needed to do this to pay for her tuition.  Oh, my God.  How many...  You're a shitty daughter.  ...gallons of tears do you think the father has shed?  Because he looks like an idiot.  Oh, boy.  He looks like an asshole.  How much time in church has he spent in front of that cross? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, my God.  Praying, lighting candles.  Where's your God now?  Oh, Jesus.  God, why have you forsaken me?  It's God's will.  Giant 10-inch cock works in mysterious ways.  It's God's will.  It's funny.  He works in mysterious ways.  Terrible.  You will learn from this.  Yes.  Accept thee.  Yes.  I'm so angry. 
[00:52:30]  It's got to be a rough one.  That's got to be a rough one for the army.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  I'm so envious of a guy who does it that well.  Yeah.  Just to be able to have sex that well on camera with a crew there.  And there's nothing sexy about the environment there.  Like, what you're watching is hot.  But from their point of view, you just see cameras and a bull mic.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Pounding her out like a machine.  You know how fledgling I'd be?  A lot of machine.  Tweaking my nips.  Yeah.  You don't think that would go over well on film?  You think the director might have a problem with you tweaking your nips? 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Holy hoo.  It's like, hey, Pally, this ain't about you.  Yeah, we need your hands to be doing something else.  Just fuck the girl.  Holy hoo.  Stop with your nipples.  I have to just.  I need to do this.  I have to.  Sorry, I have to tweak.  I have to go shuddle, shuddle, shuddle.  Shuddle, shuddle.  Oh, boy.  Holy hoo.  Yeah.  So there's your update there on the Duke lady.  Yeah.  And now we move on to the band Bossy video. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  This is one of the most ridiculous things I've heard of in recent memory.  Yeah, this is a real stupid one, but we predicted it.  They want to ban the word bossy because I guess when guys are doing what?  Guys are.  How do they say it?  Guys are considered leaders, but women are considered bossy for doing the same exact thing  or something like that.  No, men are considered bullies for doing a certain thing, and then women are considered 
[00:54:00]  bossy.  Assertive.  There's positive words for a guy being a boss that if you consider him bossy, it's not  so much a bully, but it's being assertive, being you're an authority figure, everything.  But now you take a girl, and you put her in the same position, and she becomes bitchy,  uppity, bossy, things like that.  Because the reality is, yeah, but that's not just about being an assertive woman.  That's because you want to say to the girl, stop being a dick, but you can't. 
[00:54:30]  The name for a guy who's like that is to be called a dick.  Right.  If you don't like your boss because he's being bossy, yeah, you'd be like, oh, that guy's  a dick, what an asshole, what a fucking shithead.  But apparently, you can't say that about a woman, boss.  For some reason, we just don't, but that's the thing.  The word bossy is a nice way of going, you're a scumbag, or you're an ass.  That's because we'd say about a boss, my boss is a shithead.  But if it's a woman, you're like, ah, she's so bossy.  Yeah.  You want to say twat, you want to say the same word.  Oh, we certainly do.  And it goes to our point, this is why you can't ban words, because now this is like the 
[00:55:00]  second level of words they're now trying to ban.  Right.  I think everyone is in some weird understanding that you can't call a woman the C word, you  can't call her a bitch, you can't call her a twat.  So we're on the second tier words now that we're banning?  Yeah, because they want to just reprogram.  They just want the human brain reprogram.  That's retarded.  Oh, oops.  You're always going to think of other words.  So, okay, you ban these words.  Well, I'll come up with other words to make my point.  And this is exactly what's happening here. 
[00:55:30]  It's the second tier of words they're trying to, you know, ban.  Precisely.  Who is it?  Sheryl Sandberg?  Who's Sheryl Sandberg?  Is she a boss?  Oh, she.  Well, she's very young.  Oh, wait.  And Beyonce wants in on this?  Fuck Beyonce.  Doesn't she have the N word all over her music?  Yeah, exactly.  How about she talk to her husband about his songs?  Right.  Like, I don't want any words banned, but if your songs have the N word all over the place, 
[00:56:00]  Oh, boy.  Isn't that, shouldn't you start there?  You'd think.  What are you doing?  Because it's bad for business.  Because right now that N word is hot in these songs, man.  I don't know if Beyonce has any N word songs.  Not to say she won't.  But her husband does.  Oh, her husband has a few.  Worry about your husband saying nigger in his songs  and not people saying the word bossy.  That's what you should worry about.  Why doesn't she go on a campaign against that word  and hold up her husband's records?  She shows it with an A, though.  So does Southern plantation owners. 
[00:56:30]  Oh.  I love that argument.  Well, it's the same thing.  You know, I say nigger.  It's the same thing.  I think so.  You're saying it.  You're saying it.  So here's the official video?  Yeah.  Okay.  This is Dan Bossy.  Take one.  Shut up.  Pushy.  Stubborn.  Stubborn.  Pushy.  Pushy.  Stubborn.  Stubborn.  Bossy.  Bossy.  Bossy.  Bossy.  When I was growing up, I was called bossy.  I think the word bossy is just a squasher. 
[00:57:00]  Being labeled something matters.  It's by middle school.  Girls are less interested in leadership than boys.  And that's because they worry about being called bossy.  We need to tell them it's okay to be ambitious.  We need to help.  Oh, my God.  I want to puke.  Words matter.  Let's just ban the word bossy.  And encourage girls to be.  To be strong and be ambitious.  Listen to your own voice.  There are no limits.  There should be you.  You can change the world.  Let's ban bossy. 
[00:57:30]  Be brave.  Be you.  Ban bossy.  Oh, my God.  That's a sleeping night.  You're a comic, Jane Lynch.  Jimmy Johnson, you fucking piece of shit.  I'm not bossy.  That's the only guy that you can get.  Take the pledge at banbossy.com.  I'm going to take the pledge.  Yeah.  Ban bossy.  You missed Beyonce.  She said, I'm not bossy.  I'm a boss.  Cool.  Damn.  That's very clever.  Very clever.  I'd come up with other words. 
[00:58:00]  I wouldn't know this, but granted, Philly says, doesn't Jay-Z refer to Beyonce as boss bitch in all his songs?  Yeah.  Does he?  I'm sure he has.  All right, but that's not bossy.  Well, she said I'm bossy bitch.  She's not bossy bitch.  Oh, okay.  What about using it in terms of fat girl, and you call it bossy like the cow?  Remember bossy?  So you go, hey, bossy, is that acceptable?  Was that Jimmy Johnson?  He's fat.  Yeah.  What is he doing?  It was the only guy that could get.  Who approached Jimmy Johnson and like, hey, dude, you want to be part of the bad bossy campaign? 
[00:58:30]  You'd be like, what?  Oh, my God.  What is it?  He probably thought it was really going to take off, and then he realized, oh.  I think it's extremely dangerous to ban words.  I think it's ridiculous.  Just saying ban a word.  And what?  I guess women don't want to be leaders because they're considered bossy?  Leaders don't give a fuck what you call them.  Mel Karmazin is an amazing boss.  A tough boss.  He was bossy.  He didn't give a crap what you called him.  He was bossy.  Because he was a true leader. 
[00:59:00]  If you're a true leader, you don't care.  No.  You got the ambition, and you're just going to work hard at it.  You know what I think these women should do?  Hmm.  Get over it.  Oh, shit.  Ah, damn.  They certainly are pitching a fit, aren't they?  Pitching a fit.  Just get over it, bossy.  You bossy girls. 
[00:59:30]  Pitching a fit.  Pitching a fit.  Ban bossing it.  Squeezing her tit.  Get over it.  She's bossy.  Just the inconsistency, though, in these people's, like, the way they're preaching  and morality to people.  Don't say this.  Do it.  And she's married to a guy that drops that word constantly, or at least used to.  Well, I got all the facts on this thing.  So, it's Sheryl Sandberg.  She launched the Ban Bossy campaign to empower girls to lead.  Future leaders don't care. 
[01:00:00]  They just don't care what you call them.  Their ambition, they laugh at you at all the words you call them.  They don't care.  Ban bossy.  Can banning one schoolyard word really change the world, Sheryl Sandberg says?  Yes.  Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook and author of the best-selling book, Lean  In, is spearheading the launch of a campaign today to ban the word bossy, arguing the negative  put-down stops girls from pursuing leadership roles. 
[01:00:30]  Does it?  It's just such idiocy.  It's such...  You're just lying.  Idiocy.  Yeah.  I've got league.  Then they're not made out to be a boss.  No.  We know that by middle school, more boys than girls want to lead, Sandberg said.  So, that's because they're being called bossy?  No.  That's not by way.  How are you making that connection?  I don't know why more boys want to lead than girls.  I have no idea.  But it's not because you're calling girls bossy.  No, it's the way of the world.  It's been that way.  It's kind of an ingrained thing. 
[01:01:00]  Because leading is a dominant thing.  Right.  I'm not saying it's right, but males are more, I think, through nature, inclined to be dominant.  But it has been changing over the last decade or so.  Yeah.  But if you want to take one of those leadership roles and be assertive and all the other words,  then you've got to put up with the fact that people are going to call you bossy.  You can't just ban the word and make the actual thought go away.  The idea of it, the sentiment that certain people have towards an assertive woman, 
[01:01:30]  it doesn't go away with just the word being banned.  That's the thing.  Like, you could ban the N-word.  There's still going to be people that think poorly of black people.  There's still going to be, you know, you could ban the word retard.  There's still going to be people that think, like, oh, you're incapable of doing anything.  Like, the idea is still there.  Right.  Let's see.  Where were we here?  I looked up to listen to your fine point.  Oh, hi.  And if you ask girls why they don't want to lead, whether it's the school project all the way on to running for office, 
[01:02:00]  they don't want to be called bossy and they don't want to be disliked.  Uh-huh.  But guys are just, like, for being a leader?  What are you talking about?  Now, my sister, Dawnie, she is a boss.  Right.  She's a boss.  And she says, what the fuck does ban boss even mean?  Dumbest, most useless campaign ever.  And this is coming from my uppity bitch sister who fires people. 
[01:02:30]  She's a boss.  She's very bossy.  Oh, boy.  I couldn't imagine being married to that.  But she doesn't care if people call her bossy.  No.  She probably loves it.  She doesn't care.  Yeah.  There were some big names in that video we just saw.  Yeah.  All successful women.  Really successful women.  They're just showing how they're just dumb and they're not intelligent.  They should show failures.  I would have been something, but someone called me bossy.  Right.  You don't show success.  The ex, uh, you know, Condoleezza Rice.  Condoleezza Rice. 
[01:03:00]  All these powerful, bright women who have, who become leaders, the head of faith, show  dummies who never made it.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  They don't, their opinion doesn't weigh as much.  Get the celebrities.  Get the women who, ugh.  Right.  Nonsense.  The success stories.  All right, yo, son's a big success.  Thank you.  A lot of women calling in.  We got Michelle in Louisiana.  Go ahead, Michelle.  I like to call them bitches.  Hi, Michelle.  Bitches that'll get you.  What's up, Michelle?  Hi, I'm a boss.  Hey, settle down.  Easy. 
[01:03:30]  Cookie.  Fucking uppity bitch.  If the word bossy was going to prevent me from being a boss, then I would never make  it.  This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.  Ridiculous, yeah.  If you can't face the word bossy, then you don't deserve to be a boss.  I agree.  I agree.  And there's a lot of supposed, uh, uh, intelligent women involved with this campaign.  This is one woman trying to coddle the people that are afraid of one word.  If you're afraid of the word, then don't be a boss.  All right.  Stop emasculating us.  Jesus. 
[01:04:00]  We said this was going to happen years ago.  Yeah.  When they started with the, uh, I guess it was the N word.  N word.  We said every group is going to want to have their word.  And most of the groups now have their word.  And now we're starting to see the next stage, which is the secondary words.  Because people will always think of an insult to call someone they don't like or don't understand.  You know, it's just human nature.  You know, it's just human nature.  Huh?  I'm going to say transgendered.  Yeah.  But it's like Bailey J says tranny. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  How is tranny derogatory?  How is it?  I don't understand how it's derogatory.  It doesn't mean anything terrible.  It doesn't mean it.  It means something terrific, actually.  And it was never used as a slur.  I don't think.  It's like, oh, yeah, tranny.  I think the ultimate goal is that you shouldn't point out individuality.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Everyone is exactly the same.  Yes, we have to be the same.  I think that's the ultimate goal of this whole thing.  Yeah.  Uh, thank you, whoever.  Michelle, I think it was right.  Fake empowerment.  Let's go to Philly and talk to Amber.  We're talking to the broads today. 
[01:05:00]  Hey, broad.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  The deep, manly voice you have, you bossy girl.  What's up, Amber?  Go ahead, sir.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hello.  Um, I just wanted to say, you know, I think it's fucking retarded.  Oh, hey, watch that R word.  You can't say retarded, though.  Yeah.  You're going to call me a bitch.  You're going to call me a client.  You're going to call me a bot.  All right.  You're going to call me bossy.  It just means that you don't have the balls to stand up to me.  Whoa. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, good for you.  Good for Amber.  Good for you.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  I think, I think the women, I think the women can handle themselves, by the way, when you  start coddling and, and, and banning words, that means that group can't, they're weak  and they can't handle it, right?  That's exactly what it is.  Someone just says, it sounds like this bitch is on her period.  Guys are hilarious.  He's always the leader of my school project.  I didn't care.  Right.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  True leaders don't give a crap about what is said about them.  No.  Exactly.  Can you imagine Mel Karmazin, like, crying in his office because some of his employees  call them bad names?  Bossy.  Are you kidding me?  Please.  He didn't have time for that.  Bam, bossy.  He was too busy making the stockholders more money.  He didn't care.  That was his jab.  Thanks, Amber.  Thank you, guys.  This really is one of the stupidest things I've, I've heard of in many, many years.  Many, many years. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Let's see.  Sandberg said, these attitudes begin early and continue in adulthood.  We call girls bossy on the playground, Sandberg said.  We call them too aggressive or other B words in the workplace.  B words.  They're bossy as little girls and then they're aggressive, political, shrill, too ambitious,  as women.  So those words have to go.  Yeah.  Those words have to go now.  They do.  Oh, you just read the next generation to go. 
[01:07:00]  Right.  Shrill.  You could say ambitious.  Right.  But don't say overly ambitious.  Right.  And don't say too ambitious.  People.  Look, I told you.  My son's school, they used to have a leadership program and someone complained.  So now they're just hosts.  What does that even mean?  And so they're not even training the youngsters what a leader even means.  It's like a cocktail party.  Because some kids get upset by that.  It's not even the kids because they're too young to even understand. 
[01:07:30]  No, they don't know.  It's the parents.  So they're not even training them to be leaders.  They don't know nothing.  In the classroom.  Yeah.  We used to call it a leader.  Leader of the day.  But they said it.  Somebody complains.  Who complained?  You're not allowed to say who complained.  Leader.  So now it's host for the day.  They're hosting.  Fucking come out in a smoking jacket with a fucking martini glass.  How you doing?  I'm the host.  So we're not even training future leaders. 
[01:08:00]  No.  A leader.  Somebody that is assertive.  That's a bad thing, I guess.  Sandberg's organization Lean In is joining forces with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  Lean In.  And Girl Scouts USA CEO Anna Maria Chavez to launch a public service campaign called Ban Bossy.  The Ban Bossy.com website gives tips for parents.  Oh, my God.  Let's go there.  Kids, teachers, and others about how to encourage young female leaders. 
[01:08:30]  The goal of the Ban Bossy campaign is to help girls and women feel more confident and comfortable as leaders.  I am.  I was called bossy when I was in the ninth grade, Sandberg recalled.  She's the broad from Facebook.  She's the CEO of Facebook, so I guess it was a good thing.  My teacher took my best friend Mindy aside and she said, you shouldn't be friends with Charles.  She's bossy.  And that hurt.  Did it hurt?  The word bossy is not the problem. 
[01:09:00]  The problem is the teacher was basically saying, your friend's a dick.  Right.  Don't be friends with her.  Which was stupid to say.  Yeah.  It's not the word bossy.  It's not the problem.  No.  What could we do?  Is there anything on that website that tells us what we can do to help?  I want to help.  I'm so angry.  It's so stupid.  If you look at the world, women do 66% of their work in the world.  Women produce 50% of the food.  Women make 10% of the income.  And women own 1% of the property. 
[01:09:30]  And they buy 100% of the tampons.  And they get 100% of the divorce settlements.  Yeah.  And they put out 100% of the babies.  Yeah.  We are 50% of the population.  We are 5% of the Fortune 500 CEO, Sandberg said.  We are 17% of the board seats.  We are 19% in Congress.  That's not enough for 50% of the population.  We live in a world that is overwhelmingly run and owned by men.  But those numbers have gotten better.  And it will continue to get better.  Even so.  And I don't think it's going to get drastically better because you banned the word bossy. 
[01:10:00]  That's just not.  It's just not.  It's not going to work out that way.  How about you do bring up something about 50% of the population getting 90% of the divorce settlement.  You know?  Well, if you want to fucking play by those rules, some percentages.  How about 50% of the population?  How many people are dying in wars?  What percentage of women to men is that?  How about you jump on in? 
[01:10:30]  Come on in for the big win.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's other percentages that you guys are not up to par with men that you're probably very happy you're not.  So, meh.  What do we got on the website?  What do you want?  Leadership tips for girls, parents, teachers, managers, troop leaders?  Oh, boy.  Oh, this is...  Go for fucking girls.  Oh, here.  This is so stupid.  What should we do?  10 tips to help girls flex their leadership muscles.  Teach us. 
[01:11:00]  Go to that one.  Help us help you.  Right.  Go to the right side of that page.  Holy man.  What the hell does that even mean?  Oh.  Jesus.  God.  Who's going to read all this?  Speak up in class.  Stop apologizing before you speak.  Everyone does that, by the way.  Yeah.  Challenge yourself.  Challenge yourself.  I'll win every time.  Okay.  Ask for help.  Don't do everyone else's work.  Speak up in friendship.  Trust your own inner voice. 
[01:11:30]  These are good tips for kids in general.  Right.  Change the world.  Remember, it's not always easy to speak up, but it's worth it.  Is that being bossy?  Practice.  Practice what?  There you go.  What dumb rules.  Oh, what a boring website this is.  Oh, boy.  We should put some porn on that website.  That'd get it.  Damn.  What are we doing?  I don't know. 
[01:12:00]  For Beyonce to sit there and say, and me, I'm looking up Jay-Z songs, Bitches and Sisters.  Exactly.  Why don't you go, and the guy you sleep with every night who put a baby in you, why don't  you obsess over, why don't you bring your husband out and say, my husband is no longer  going to say this word.  He's no longer going to sing this song, this song, and this song, because it says niggas,  it says bitches, and I feel that's a bad, come on.  God bringing that guap.  But you don't, it's just nonsense.  Utter nonsense. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, in a guap.  Yeah.  We're just a fucking society of douchebags that have nothing better to do.  We need a real good fucking crisis in this country again.  We are.  I mean, we need a fucking 9-11 style fucking crisis.  Slow down.  Because when that happened, it really jolted people back to reality, to where you prioritized  again.  Our priorities are so fucking out of whack right now, to even be concentrating on this 
[01:13:00]  is an embarrassment, a global embarrassment, when important things are happening around  the globe, and we're worried about the word bossy, and that's what's making the news.  Fucking, Americans need a smack in the face every few fucking years.  We are a pussified.  We are a bunch of fucking fags.  Sorry.  Let's say hi to Lisa in New Orleans.  New Orleans.  Lisa, what's up? 
[01:13:30]  You can drink right there in the airport.  Right here in the airport.  In the airport.  Right here in the airport.  You want a hurricane?  Tom is one of the greatest characters of all time.  Not a character.  He's a real guy.  Go ahead, Lisa.  This shit's making women look really stupid.  I agree.  I think it makes you guys look extremely weak, like you can't take care of yourselves.  I agree.  And I believe that them telling people to ban the word bossy in itself is white bossy. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  You're being bossy by saying this is what we want.  Yeah, true.  Yes.  See?  Women are stronger than this, and I'm disappointed that a woman in a leadership position would  say something so fucking stupid.  Because her message about be assertive, be strong, like those are great messages.  Of course.  And don't let anybody discourage you because you're a girl.  Those are really smart messages to give a young girl.  I work in corporate America. 
[01:14:30]  I can be assertive, and I have leadership qualities, and I can do that without being...  I don't like her already.  Exactly.  You're pushy.  Right.  Listen to her.  But do you show the cleavage?  There you go.  Donna wants to know.  More importantly.  Right.  Do you go to work with a little cleavage?  Right.  And then us guys are not allowed to look.  Yeah.  Or we'll be called down to the HR office.  Do you mind a little smack on the fanny as you're walking in between cubicles?  A little pinch. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  Only if you don't mind when I smack you back on the ass.  Oh, there you go.  Now you're talking.  Now you're chalking.  Hey, Jimmy, when are you going to come do a show in New Orleans?  Oh, Jimmy.  I've never done a show in New Orleans.  I did a college with Pete Correale and Louis Ramey probably in 2000 or 1998.  That's the famous lap dance that I shot in my pants story.  Yes, you fucking came in your pants.  I've never done a full set in New Orleans.  I would love to go down there and do one.  I really do. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, my God.  We need you.  We need you.  And I'll get a lap dance with you if you come to the new show here.  That's nice.  Look at that.  Pushy broad and a lap dance.  She's a leader, too.  She certainly is.  She'll take it.  She'll be like, hey, put your money away.  I got it.  She'll let that hair down after she leaves the office, though.  Look out.  And unbutton one more button.  She can bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan,  and never, never, never let you forget you're a man.  And she's the woman.  Angelique.  Exactly, Jimmy. 
[01:16:00]  All right, Lisa.  Thank you for your two cents on the band bossy thing.  Her two cents.  Of course, a man, it would have been 12 cents.  Yeah.  And spent wisely.  Exactly.  She's just going to buy perfumes and hats.  Stupid things.  But you got some big, big intelligent women involved with this.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  They look ridiculous.  And then Jimmy Johnson. 
[01:16:30]  What are you doing?  Jimmy Johnson.  Just fucking.  What are you doing?  Just get in your car and drive fast and shut up.  The only guy.  Oh, boy.  I started, after they showed Jimmy Johnson, like, okay, there's got to be other guys involved.  No, the only guy they could get.  You don't want to be the only guy.  Oh.  Bossy's not good.  Not cool, guys.  Not cool.  Not cool.  But then again, maybe, who knows what he said.  Like, they may have said, like, hey, we're doing this whole band bossy thing campaign to empower young women. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  And they may have just stressed that it was about empowering young women.  Right.  Because he didn't say band bossy.  No.  So he might have said, well, I think young girls should be told to be assertive.  And then they just put that in like he's a big band bossy.  Which is fine.  But it's the only guy.  He tweeted hashtag band bossy.  Fuck him, then.  Shit.  Keep driving in a circle.  Tell me.  It's on me.  It's just.  Because the message of what they're saying is being clouded by the garbage language police. 
[01:17:30]  Like, their message of be stronger and be assertive and don't let anybody discourage you.  Uh-huh.  That's really smart.  Right.  And it's important and it's good and, you know.  But they just go too far.  Now it's about the word bossy.  That's not the problem, dummies.  It's the underlying message of women not being.  Words matter.  Words matter.  Not really.  Words matter.  There's some good tips on this website for children in general. 
[01:18:00]  But to say ban the word bossy, that's where it's ridiculous.  A little over the top.  A little.  Way over the top.  You know why words don't matter as much?  Because it's all in how you use them.  If words mattered that much, if they were that important, then there's not one rapper that would say nigga in the songs.  Or not one rapper would say bitch.  Yeah.  Not one female celebrity would say bitch.  I mean, if it was that important.  Women in rap songs are fucking just degraded.  Yeah.  And yeah.  So why doesn't anyone say anything about that?  They just don't.  No one does. 
[01:18:30]  The whole industry is like, they come out against all kinds of things, but never that.  Well, you go after the easier stuff.  That's true.  That's what happens.  It's way easier to go after this than rap lyrics.  You know, calling a woman a bitch or a howp.  It's money to be made.  And also rappers, though.  Rappers don't care.  Like rappers, their audience is honest.  They like what they're doing.  Right.  And they're just going to say what they want.  And they don't give a fuck if you like it.  And that's why I like rappers.  Like, I love the fact that Nicki Minaj put that song out. 
[01:19:00]  Good.  Don't anybody tell you what to say?  There's way more influence when you listen to songs like that than trying to ban Bossy.  Yeah.  Way more.  That is way more of a problem if you're looking at this stuff as problems.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Man, the Steve Irwin audio is brutal.  The cameraman guy.  We'll play that after the break.  Oh, boy.  But it's all set in the...  I didn't realize he was pretty much stabbed a hundred times by the stingray. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, who knew that?  I thought it was one.  I thought it was one death block.  Just hit him in the bad spot.  And they fucking...  The little tail just goes...  But then it's hard to get emotional because the guy who's speaking has an Australian accent.  So everything goes up at the end.  Goes up at the end.  And sounds kind of fun.  Sounds kind of nice.  Right.  Or nice and pleasant.  Get back.  Get a steak.  Ugh.  Fake guy. 
[01:20:00]  We're getting the band bossy tweets there, Sam, for after the break, too?  Yeah, we got a handful of them.  That and the Steve Irwin...  Actually, it's his cameraman talking about that day.  Damn.  After the break.  Come together with your hands.  Save me.  Come together with your plans.  Save me.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:20:30]  I like that song.  Do-do-do.  Nice.  Yeah.  Just reading that Colorado collected $2 million in recreational marijuana taxes in January.  Oh, yeah?  Is it reasonable?  Our numbers should be higher, right?  Taxes.  Let me think.  Well, it was since the first of the year, right?  Well, for the month of January, they made $2 million in taxes.  That's pretty good.  That's all right. 
[01:21:00]  It's not a great business.  $24 million for the year for the state.  How many people live in Colorado, though?  Three.  Oh, I would have thought more.  I thought that number would be higher.  Any negatives about the weed thing?  I heard a lot of dogs are being admitted to the veterinarian because they're ingesting pot.  Why?  At an alarming rate.  People are just having...  Leaving their weed laying around.  Yeah, that's what I was sort of trying to say.  And the little puppies come up and eat it. 
[01:21:30]  They eat that shit.  Must and I fucking eat it.  Spoon man.  It's like 90s fucking day, huh?  We should talk about 90s music.  I don't think we've ever talked about it.  No, we've never done a break on that.  No, we have.  Oh, right.  Steve Irwin's cameraman.  Hi.  Finally talking.  How many years has it been for the Steve Irwin thing?  Stingray.  How many years has it been for Steve Irwin?  At least...  2008?  I was going to say five. 
[01:22:00]  Eight years, I think.  Right?  Something like that?  Wow, really?  Yeah, I think so.  How many years?  Whoa.  Eight years.  2006.  Nice.  Steve Irwin's been gone eight years?  Hey, jeez.  Well, the cameraman's finally speaking.  How's that funny-looking daughter of his?  Bindi.  Oh, she's all right.  She looks like little Steve Irwin, though.  She looks too much like little Steve Irwin.  She's growing up to be aight.  Is she?  Yeah, she's aight. 
[01:22:30]  Is she chubby still?  No, she's kind of...  She's a fat.  Let me see.  All right?  She's cute.  Man.  All right.  She's got that Steve Irwin face.  She's all right.  She's pretty funny.  She's aight.  She's pretty.  Yeah, she's not bad.  How old is she now?  She's 45.  It's amazing.  Wasn't she the one he was holding with the alligator or the crocodile?  Yes.  I don't know what the fuck it was.  Yes.  And there was a bunch of controversy.  Right.  Like he didn't know what he was doing.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right. 
[01:23:00]  In the end, he didn't know what he was doing.  He fucking didn't know what he was doing.  No, I think it was just one of those horrible...  Sucks to be you.  Certainly is.  Because I'm sure he knew what he was doing.  If you're Steve Irwin and you get killed by a stingray, that's like being up to plate in the  World Series and striking out on a fucking wiffle ball.  Yeah.  You can't get killed.  Terrible example.  You can't get killed by something you're allowed to pet.  Right.  Yeah.  At aquariums, you just fucking put your hand in there. 
[01:23:30]  You go to the Cayman Islands.  They have...  I forgot what it's called.  Stingray Bay or whatever the hell they call it.  Yeah.  And you're in the water with them in about three feet of water.  Not anymore.  Find that.  Cayman Islands.  We did it.  It's crazy.  It's really creepy because they give you food and stuff.  So they swarm you and you get to pet a whole bunch of stingrays while you're in the water  with them.  Do you see that fucking spike on their tail?  You see it all.  Look.  Yeah.  There you go.  Stingray...  Oh, yeah.  Stingray City it's called, of course.  Yeah.  Stingray City.  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  That's a guy that...  You could also go scuba diving with them.  But there's a section where you're pretty much...  I'm trying to remember.  Maybe the water's up to your waist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they come...  They're all over the place.  Look at that.  It was fun.  I don't like being underwater with animals.  I bet you they're still allowing that down there in the Cayman Islands.  No.  They don't care about safety at any of those places.  Nope.  So here's the cameraman talking about his death.  We'd been filming.  We stood up.  We said, what shots do we want to get?  We always tried to put the animal between Steve and I underwater so the animal was in 
[01:24:30]  the foreground.  Foreground?  And we stood up and said, one last shot.  You swim up from behind the animal.  Oh, one last shot.  And I'll try and get a shot of it swimming away.  And so that's what we did.  So that's Steve swimming up and you're getting the shot.  And what happened?  Well, I had the camera on.  I thought, this is going to be a great shot.  It's going to be in the doco for sure.  Fantastic.  And...  So where's this footage?  Exactly.  Why won't they show it?  Well, it's out of courtesy to the family, I think.  Why not?  He's getting cagged by a stick. 
[01:25:00]  Who wouldn't want to see that?  Oh, boy.  Well, a lot of people want to see it, but I think they're...  I bet Bindi doesn't want to see it.  Right.  I sort of understand why they're holding it back.  Eventually, it'll make it out there.  I'm sure.  All of a sudden, it propped on its front and started stabbing wildly with its tail.  Jesus.  Hundreds of strikes in a few seconds.  Hundreds.  Hundreds.  They're incredibly powerful animals, and they've been on the planet for 60 million years.  So they've survived because they're survivors. 
[01:25:30]  It probably thought that Steve's shadow was a tiger shark, which feeds on them very regularly.  And so it started to attack him.  I panned with the camera as the stingray swam away.  I didn't even know it had caused any damage.  It wasn't until I panned the camera back that Steve was standing in a huge pool of blood  that I realised something had gone wrong.  Wow.  If you're a tiger shark, is a stingray a good eats?  Oh, what?  Yeah, they're like fucking ocean pancakes.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Ocean pancakes.  Delicious.  Wouldn't you gnaw away at a stingray?  That would be horrendous.  Oh, my God.  Some bathers have been injured.  Those beaches will be open.  It's the 4th of July.  His anchor jacket.  I love that thing.  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Dallas.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Happy birthday to me.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  So I've been to Stingray City down there in the Caymans, and they told us that the stingrays, 
[01:26:30]  they got Steve Irwin, are like a lot more aggressive.  So they probably just told us that.  Of course they did.  Yeah.  What are they going to say?  This could happen to you?  Well, I would assume it's the same stingrays.  Sir?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Sir?  What happens to people?  I don't know.  We're having a conversation.  Imagine you're on the street, and you're having a conversation, and you say something, 
[01:27:00]  and the guy just turns around and walks away.  That's what just happened.  He just walks away.  This is like real life.  You call the show.  Now we're going to try to have a little conversation.  A little discussion.  He just walked away from our discussion.  He just hangs up.  He got bored of us.  I value my life a lot more than $3,000, chief.  Cameraman attempts to save Steve as he's in a pool of blood after being stung.  Is it a sting?  Pool of blood?  How do you clean those? 
[01:27:30]  He was struck over a hundred times.  A hundred times.  Wow.  And that short stingray.  That motherfucker.  They're like ollie speed.  Yeah.  In seconds.  A hundred times.  Was Steve able to swim at that point?  Oh, yeah.  He was doing a backstroke.  It was seconds, but it felt like forever, because time really did slow down for me there.  I bet it didn't.  And again, contrary to what I'd read in the papers and everything I heard at the time,  which was just incorrect, the stingray barb was a blade about a foot extending out of the 
[01:28:00]  middle part of its tail.  So it's not at the tip of the tail.  It's about the middle.  It's a bit like a fingernail.  And the other half is embedded in the tail of the stingray.  It didn't come out.  Steve didn't pull it out.  It's a jagged, sharp barb.  And it went through his chest like a hot knife through butter.  He thought it had punctured his lung.  And he stood up out of the water and screamed, it's puncturing me lung.  Within a few seconds, the inflatable that had been motoring about 30 meters away was there.  So we threw him into the boat and assessed the situation for about five seconds. 
[01:28:30]  He had about a two-inch wide injury over his heart with blood and fluid coming out of it.  Oh, boy.  And we thought we've got to get him back to the boat as fast as we can.  Wow.  And if the cameraman heard all these false facts,  why wouldn't you have come out and said that wasn't true?  Wow.  Maybe he's been tormented. 
[01:29:00]  Maybe he's fucking living with his nightmares.  He's finally out of shock.  Waking up with night terrors.  Screaming was a little more important.  Trying to get one fucking minute sleep at night.  It took me a year.  That horrid image in his head.  Holy shit.  It's finally over the eight years of nightmares.  Sam.  Waking up in a cold sweat,  and thinking it's Steve Irwin's blood.  Yeah, yeah.  Steve's last words.  As we're motoring back,  I'm screaming at one of the other crew in the boat 
[01:29:30]  to put my hand over the wound.  And we're saying to him things like,  think of your kid Steve,  hang on, hang on, hang on.  And he just sort of calmly looked up at me and said,  I'm dying.  And that was the last thing he said.  Oh, boy.  What a thing to hear from one of your closest mates.  Mates.  What was going through your mind  when he was looking up at you saying that?  Breakfast.  He wants more tears.  What could he be thinking?  Right.  He's dying.  Through your tears. 
[01:30:00]  He just gave you some amazing TV.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, right.  I'm on this.  Don't worry about it, kid.  Don't worry about it.  You got the moment.  You got it.  And now you push it.  Right.  Now you're pushing,  because now you need the tears.  I don't know why this cameraman  is so caught up with Steve Irwin.  I mean, it's been a long time.  Holy shit.  It's been eight years.  I mean.  I've been waking up in the middle of the night screaming.  I think it's just time. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, Travis.  You know, that's the problem  when you have like multiple things to be doing.  Oh, that sounds like an E-Rock excuse.  No, it's not an excuse.  I'm just trying to get the video  so I can post it on Twitter.  Were you helping someone on the phones?  No, I'm not, actually.  That's usually what E-Rock says he was doing.  No.  I'm sorry, Jim.  What's going on?  Oh, nothing.  I was just talking about Steve Irwin.  I'm like, I don't know.  The kid.  Get over it.  Get over it.  I'm just running, crying, 
[01:31:00]  and pitching a fit.  Get over it.  Get over it.  Each pitch in a fit.  I find when he was looking up at you saying that.  Jim?  I'm not sure.  To be honest,  I don't think I realized how serious it was.  I didn't know that it'd pierced his heart.  I thought maybe it's just pierced his lung  and we've got a good chance of saving him.  Saving him?  He probably lapsed into unconsciousness,  even though his eyes were open,  somewhere in those 30 seconds,  getting him back to Croc 1, 
[01:31:30]  the mothership.  And we literally put him on the duck board  and I started CPR on him straight away.  Straight away?  But there was no hope, wasn't there?  There was always hope.  I mean, we hoped for a miracle.  So we, you know,  I literally did CPR on him for over an hour  before we got him to Low Isles  where the helicopter arrived  and the medics came.  But then they pronounced him dead  within 10 seconds of looking at him.  Cheers.  Did he say anything else to you?  No.  Can you pause real quick?  Not his final words.  He just said to you, 
[01:32:00]  those are the last words he ever said.  So what do you think?  Oh yeah, he did.  He said a couple other things  I forgot about when I just said  those were his last words.  You got it.  You got an amazing moment.  That's...  Yeah.  She's trying to fucking squeeze more  amazing TV.  Out of it.  He's doing CPR  and just pushing more blood out of his body.  I know.  It's...  Oh boy.  That is horrible.  CPR.  Got him on the duck board.  He just knew though, man.  Croc 1.  Yeah.  Jeez. 
[01:32:30]  I thought it was one strike.  Hundreds.  That hit him in the heart or whatever.  I wonder how many times it hit his heart.  If it like chewed his heart up  or if it was just one shot through.  Oh God.  But it was able to like  cut through his chest like butter.  What kind of force is that?  That'll do that.  Yeah.  He said it's like razor sharp or whatever,  but still.  Butter on a garlic mashed potatoes.  Here at the end, Bick.  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  So.  Bon voyage.  Arrivederci.  Alvita zang.  Let me say hi to Keith in Illinois.  Keith.  Yeah, I've actually read a couple of blog sites years ago while I was looking for the video.  And I've heard that it got destroyed.  The video actually got destroyed.  I don't know how true that is or not.  I am.  But do you guys find it ironic that the guy got killed by a stingray of all the fucking things that guy is fucked with? 
[01:33:30]  No one ever brought that up.  Yeah.  I didn't mention that chemist going to bomb the joke.  Oh, well, you know.  Jeez.  I can't hear what you guys are doing on this phone.  Get over it.  Get over it.  Oh.  All right.  Let's go to Mississippi.  Might have better luck in Mississippi.  Brad.  Yeah, I've been to Stingray City several years ago.  And they're more like pets there.  There was one boat out in the middle of the bay. 
[01:34:00]  And you're on a sandbar in the middle of the bay anywhere from, say, waist deep to knee deep.  And the boat that was already there was speeding them.  Can I say all this?  I could have sworn you said all this.  Do what?  You're in water up to your waist and you're feeding the stingrays.  Stingray City.  I said all this.  Cayman Islands.  Well, just give me one moment.  The, uh...  Fair enough.  Fair enough, Brad.  Just give me one moment.  All right.  He's being bossy. 
[01:34:30]  Fair enough.  But he's a guy, so it's okay.  Yeah.  Pass the sugar.  We'll make believe we're in Starbucks as we're having a little chit-chat about Steve Irwin.  Don't walk away.  Don't walk away.  Exactly.  We could work this out.  Go ahead, Brad.  Well, the stingrays are almost tame because they come from one boat when they hear your  boat pulling up and they come to your boat.  They know what the food is, yeah.  Well, someone else is saying that they were tame, but let me tell you something.  They're still wild animals.  Exactly.  They've been trained that there's going to be a lot of food in that area, of course, 
[01:35:00]  so maybe that helps a bit.  But in the end, their little prehistoric brains are still, you know, they're dinosaurs, basically.  You fuck with them.  They're going to try to sting you.  Right.  With that dumb thing.  People that had on sandals or flip-flops or whatever told us to go barefooted and shuffle  your feet in the sand so that you didn't step on top of them and piss them off.  Yeah, I hate when they give you those instructions because then you're in the water thinking,  I'm going to blow it.  I know.  I'm not going to shuffle good enough or something.  I'm going to get stung in the foot. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  I bet Steve Irwin wished somebody would have given him instructions.  Sir, why do you have to be so mean?  That's very mean.  Really.  We're trying to raise the level here.  All right.  This guy says he knows Steve Irwin's last word.  Joe and Yonkers.  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Yes.  Yeah.  His last breath, he whimpered out.  Slobo!  Oh.  Did he yell slobo?  That's weird.  That's weird.  Why would he do that?  I don't know.  It's a very odd thing to yell. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  I know about the stingray.  See, Andy in Florida.  Andy.  Hey, yeah, I don't know about Stingray City and what they do there.  It sounds like a wild place, but in the touch of tanks where they have kids and everything  in the plurie, like that, they cut the barb off.  So the tail, the big tail hanging off the back is not the part that stinks.  Right.  We learned that.  It's like halfway up the tail, this barb comes out and it's sharp and it'll cut you. 
[01:36:30]  It'll go through you like butter.  I didn't know that.  And all of these touch of tanks that they put three-year-old kids in, they cut that  shit off.  Do you like butter?  Right.  No, I like butter.  Nobody's getting hurt in those.  Yeah, but the problem is Stingray City, which I've been to in the Cayman Islands.  Great song by Guns N' Roses.  It's in the wide open.  They're not fenced in.  No.  So they absolutely have their barbs intact. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  So why the hell aren't they just chopping through tours like it's nothing?  Wait, nobody liked my Guns N' Roses joke?  Was that really a bad one?  Did you have to reiterate that you said it?  It's not good.  Although I did run it through my head.  Yeah.  Take me down to Stingray City.  Things right around.  Jimmy, we'll see you in Florida in two months.  In Tampa.  Thank you, sir.  I'll see you there.  Uh-oh.  We fed Stingrays and fed... 
[01:37:30]  Dennis in Indiana.  Dennis.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  In November, we went to Antigua.  And again, like that guy just said, there's a sandbar out there.  And what happens is the old-time fishermen used to feed, you know, used to clean their fish  on the sandbar in the water.  And all the Stingrays came up.  And then they end up fencing them in.  And someone complained.  And they said not to fence them in anymore.  And because the tour boats were still going there, the Stingrays just went there. 
[01:38:00]  And I asked the guy before we went in, because we could swim with him.  It's the greatest story of the first.  I was just thinking, this is up there in the top four worst stories I've ever heard.  This story is so dull.  He's going to explain the Stingrays.  You are a dullard.  It's just a terrible story.  I'm sorry, sir.  I lost interest so quickly.  Completely.  It's one of those stories where you nod a lot and your eyes start darting around a bit. 
[01:38:30]  Just looking for anything else of interest.  Giving the storyteller a hint.  A little hint to wrap it up.  To wrap it up.  I'm going to wrap.  Wrap it up.  I'll wrap it up.  Wrap it up.  Go ahead, sir.  We fed them and stuff like that.  So, all right.  But they had the barbs or not?  Barbs and no barbs.  No, they said they took the barbs off.  But if they're not fenced in anymore, they're not taking the barbs out.  Exactly.  Why would they take the barbs out?  Does the Stingrays want to say funny things to each other? 
[01:39:00]  Oh, God.  Maybe.  You talk about maybe in that.  All right.  Let me.  The guy with the horrid story didn't even like that.  Well, Joe's going to add something different.  Hey, Joe.  Joe in Chicago.  Joe, thank you for calling the Open Athlete Show.  Go ahead.  I don't know if I want to say anything.  You guys are just talking shit.  No, not at all.  We are shit talking today.  We're just being silly.  Yes.  Trying to get some jokes out there.  Go ahead.  I know.  Well, just so you know, I'm into the game.  And they tell you that this shit's not fenced in. 
[01:39:30]  But, like, quarter mile out, it's fenced in.  All those are supposed to be there.  They are debarbs.  And the other thing I wanted to say was they did a documentary with what's-his-nut's-wife.  And they show it.  He's losing confidence in this story.  You hear him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  His voice is tailing off.  He completely lost confidence in this story.  We were all hoping that Israeli Mossad agents had planted a little thing in your phone.  It would explode. 
[01:40:00]  So, anyway, they showed Terry the video, and then they showed her throwing away, destroying the only copy of it.  That's why we'll never see it.  Sorry, I'm not sure it is, but that's what it was.  Once again, I can't see how they fenced in the stingrays in Stingray City.  I just don't see it.  Because there's also a drop-off where it goes into the ocean.  Oh.  It's a sandbar.  Yeah.  No.  It's very deep in the ocean. 
[01:40:30]  It's hard to fence off the ocean.  And there's hundreds of them.  Yeah.  How are they sure they've got every single one?  Right.  They move around all willy-nilly, so if you keep your eyes on them like this, like a, you know, swarming bees, going,  okay, I think we got all the swarming bees stingers out.  It's like three-card money.  Right.  Can't keep your eye on it.  This guy knows what Stingray tastes like.  Don?  Don on the phone?  Hey.  Not a good start. 
[01:41:00]  Don, you're off to a rough start.  Yeah, start over.  Take a deep breath.  You don't want to start a story with the end.  I lost my train of thought.  All right.  Come on.  We can do this.  We can do this.  I grew up in Florida.  The Stingray thing was to show up on your feet, shit, is because if you don't, you'll get nailed on it, just like the guy would say before.  You'll step on them.  They freak out.  And they'll jab you. 
[01:41:30]  And it hurts like shit.  It's happened to me.  The second thing is that Stingrays taste just like scallops.  You go to some of your cheese, your East Coast seafood displays, and you're not eating scallops.  You're eating Stingrays.  Really?  Oh, they make them look like scallops with that cookie cutter thing.  A cookie cutter.  Cutter.  They take it like a punch, and they bend it a little bit, because scallops, of course, aren't exactly round.  Right.  They take a punch, and they kind of bend it a little awkward. 
[01:42:00]  And I'll just punch the crap out of them, and then they fucking serve it to you, and there you go.  Cursing does not make the story more interesting, sir.  No, but I like the fact that that's where fake scallops come from.  Fake scallops.  You finding that fucking Malaysian airline plane couldn't have made that story more interesting.  If you said I got stung by a Stingray as I stepped on the plane wreckage, I'd still have lost interest.  Yeah, that happened to me a long time ago as a kid.  I know.  It's a good story.  I like it.  Thank God you made it through.  Let's go to Larry King.  Larry! 
[01:42:30]  Chas, question, boys.  What happened to the grocery?  What happened to Steve Irwin's groceries?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, guys.  That's not a good Larry King.  John in Providence, though, has something.  John.  Hi, yeah.  I'd like to say that I think the Stingray that killed Steve Irwin was a real C Munster.  C Munster.  Who's that from?  It's the cheese thing.  It's a callback.  I like it.  Oh, wow.  That's an old callback.  When everyone came up with the same joke over and over again. 
[01:43:00]  The Munster guy.  The Munster.  Very good, John.  We just reworked it for this one.  I like it.  Another guy knows what Stingray tastes like.  Oh, boy.  Let me see what this is.  I bet it's scallops.  Les in Alabama.  Les.  Hey, yeah.  Long-time listener.  First-time caller.  Yeah.  First name is I Could Care.  All right, Les.  Go ahead.  Not just first name. 
[01:43:30]  His last name is interesting than the last caller.  Go ahead, Les.  Sorry.  Yes, go ahead, Les.  Stingray tastes just like chicken.  Just like chicken.  Everything else tastes.  That will be it for the phones today.  Thank you, Les in Alabama.  Good run with the phones today.  Even grading on the Alabama curve.  That was awful.  Yeah.  What's this Vice documentary? 
[01:44:00]  I'm all about Vice.  I haven't seen this one yet, though.  Oh, yeah.  This was a good one.  Sal turned me on to it.  Uh-oh.  It's about K's.  Yeah.  Vice.  I go to Vice's YouTube channel every Saturday and Sunday morning.  Yeah.  Because there's nothing on TV, and I just check out Vice's videos.  They're great.  They're really, really well done.  Yeah, Vice is good.  And they're all over the place in a good way.  There's so many different topics and subjects they hit on.  And I watched one that had real good, really good potential, but it fell slightly flat. 
[01:44:30]  The guy who took acid and then did stand-up.  Wow.  Did open mic.  That would be horrifying.  Did it on purpose.  Like, all right.  I would think, yeah.  I guess as a guy, I think he does some kind of series where, like, he has people do acid  and then do, like, regular stuff.  Not regular stuff, but stuff.  Stuff that you wouldn't normally do on acid.  Yeah, I forgot some of the other things he's had people do on acid, because I only saw the  first one so far, and it was this guy that was going to do, you know, some stand-up at 
[01:45:00]  an open mic night.  And it felt just a little short, unfortunately.  But the concept was pretty cool.  Yeah, concept sounds fucking crazy.  Yeah.  And then that led me to some, I don't think it was a Vice video, but, like, they were  experimenting with Housewives from the 50s with LSD.  Wow.  And they got a lady that takes LSD.  It's a black and white.  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's trippy, man.  Was he all fucked up?  Yeah, it's like, don't you see that? 
[01:45:30]  You want to find that?  Sure.  Might be, put 50s LSD experiment.  And then we'll lead to the new Vice documentary that you said Sal turned you onto?  Mm-hmm.  There you go.  There she is.  Yeah, listen to a little of this.  Dr. Sidney, here, pause that.  Sorry.  That's the setup.  Dr. Sidney Cohen interviews a research subject and administers LSD to her at the Los Angeles 
[01:46:00]  Veterans Administration Hospital.  Wow.  1950s housewife tries LSD.  I volunteer?  Yeah.  She volunteered.  I see.  Do you feel you're normal?  I hope I'm normal.  I think so.  Well, a little while back, you took quite a series of psychological tests, and I can assure  you that you're a very stable and well-balanced person as a result of the tests. 
[01:46:30]  And how do you feel about coming here and drinking this strange material?  Material.  I'm a little nervous, perhaps.  Well, I think that's normal.  Well, I think it's time for you to have your glycogen acid.  Holy shit.  Drink this down, and we'll be back after a while, and see how you're doing.  Right.  This is crazy.  For the first time, some housewife from the 50s.  Water. 
[01:47:00]  Water.  Colorless.  Tasteless.  It contains 100 gamma of LSD-25.  One-tenth of a milligram.  The equivalent of one-six-hundredth of a grain.  Wow.  An ounce of this material will make 150,000 such doses.  One ounce.  Let us observe the effect.  Look how happy the researcher is.  She's holding her index finger up in the air.  Well, tell me. 
[01:47:30]  Well, I just couldn't.  I couldn't possibly tell you.  It's here.  Can't you feel it?  Oh, wow.  This whole room.  Everything is in color, and I can feel the air.  I can see it.  Obviously, it's in proper white.  I can see all the molecules.  All the molecules.  I'm part of it.  Can't you see it?  No.  I'm trying.  She's looking around the room. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, it's just like you're released, or you're free, or...  She's fucked up.  Yeah.  I don't know how I can tell you.  How do you feel inside?  Inside.  Don't make her think...  Inside.  Oh, boy.  Is it all one?  Freak her out.  Yeah.  Tell her there's a black gentleman coming in the door.  If it would be all one, if you weren't here, and if nobody else, yes, everything is one. 
[01:48:30]  You have nothing to do with it.  I am one with what I am.  Wow.  I can see everything in the door.  She just sounds like any dumb broad.  Everything.  You have to see the air.  You can't believe it.  And...  And the dimensions, and all the prisons, and the rays, and everything coming down through you, and moving. 
[01:49:00]  Get over it.  What does this all mean?  Kitchen of Fit.  I've never seen this infinite beauty in my life.  It's like a...  She's kind of sexy.  A curtain or a spiderwebber.  She's dead now.  Yeah.  Can you see it?  It's right here in front of me, right now.  Oh, boy.  She's getting emotional.  No.  She needs the old 50s belt in the face. 
[01:49:30]  Exactly.  You know what went through me?  She's freaking out.  Went through her?  It passed right through me.  Holy shit.  She's voted.  I...  I...  Me?  I'm worthy of me.  Oh.  This LSD is something.  Pan to the psychiatrist.  He's cranking his pud.  Oh, just jacking.  Wow.  She's, like, biting her fingernail. 
[01:50:00]  This cool...  Creepy physician.  Yeah, it's like McCluskey.  Stand her up.  Pleasant or unpleasant?  Aren't these the right words?  Thought I told you MILFs to stay out of here.  Pleasant or unpleasant?  I bet she's got the biggest bush.  Oh, exactly.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Big, hairy, thatched.  It's beautiful.  It's...  Like a thatched roof.  Thank you.  Rotten curtains behind her.  Oh, yeah.  Can't you feel it?  No. 
[01:50:30]  Everything is so beautiful and lovely and...  And alive.  You shouldn't say anything about anything not being...  This is reality.  How did they think this was bad, then?  No kidding.  She's, like, talking about how good everything is.  Uh-oh.  Oh, she's pointing at something again.  She's pointing at the ceiling.  Are you looking...  Can you...  Yes, what should I see? 
[01:51:00]  You're like, all I see are monsters.  And then you freak her out.  I wish I could talk in technicolor.  Or...  Or let you see...  Can you...  Did you say you can see it?  No, I can't quite see it.  Tell me about it.  Damn.  It's...  I can't tell you about it.  If you can't see it, then you'll just never know it. 
[01:51:30]  I'd like to see her after this,  when she comes down and talks out.  Of her experience.  That ghoul again.  It just goes...  He's like, yeah.  Okay.  You know how you know old 50s footage?  They didn't...  They couldn't do it.  They didn't do anything with the shadows on the wall behind it.  The lighting was not as advanced in these shoes.  So there's always some dumb shadow on the wall.  If you want more of that video...  That was cool.  I think they have, like, a few, you know, doctors or psychologists or...  Accommodation of whatever. 
[01:52:00]  Talking about?  Yeah, talking about what they think was going on there and stuff.  So...  She is dead.  I bet that was some pure fucking LSD.  Yeah.  That was probably some really good stuff.  Yeah.  This is a glass of water.  Water.  Water.  Water.  Pretty wild, huh?  Yeah.  So...  Yeah.  Vice Larry went to that video.  I don't think that's a Vice video officially, but...  Yeah.  You know.  You jump on that internet, you don't know where the hell you're going to end up.  It's a fucking crazy journey you take. 
[01:52:30]  Absolutely.  Hop on that old information superhighway.  There's their stand-up on LSD.  Did he make any sense?  Well, I mean...  You know, it's the build-up.  He's in his apartment.  He's nervous.  He takes the LSD.  Then he has a tough time leaving his apartment.  He's not sure if he could even walk down the stairs.  They get him finally to the club.  I think if we can fast-forward right to...  He's only on stage for like a minute.  Where is the comedy?  Where does he do it?  England somewhere. 
[01:53:00]  London, I believe.  I was getting up there, and then it was silent.  And it was suddenly like...  Because it was silent, my mind kind of took a breath.  Stand-up comedy on acid.  There's this space for me to think.  Spice.  I may as well just tell my joke.  So, the SAS, they've not got any people left in them.  So, they have interviews, open interviews.  And a farmer comes along and he goes,  I want to join the SAS.  I'm really brave.  And they say, well, what's brave about you? 
[01:53:30]  What in your life?  And he says, well, one day, I was out farming,  and they tractor broke down three miles away from where I lived  with my wife, Mrs Farmer.  And she, the tractor, yeah, the tractor broke down.  I looked into the tractor engine, and it bolted back to life, 
[01:54:00]  and it ripped one of my arms off.  So, I was like, shit.  I've only got one arm.  And so, I grabbed that arm, and I ran all the way back.  Mrs Farmer, she sewed it back on.  And here I am.  And I said, that's very brave.  Well done.  You're definitely in to the SAS.  And he said, thank you.  I'll see you on Monday.  No, I'm going to see it. 
[01:54:30]  Fuck yeah.  You like that one?  I just said, at that point, all the anxiety kind of was melting away.  And I was starting to have fun, actually.  It was like chariots of fucking fire.  I was like, I'm going.  I'm like, I'm on my way now.  And then literally, I'm just running into your arms.  That one's called stand-up comedy on acid on Vice's YouTube channel.  And like I said, it felt a little short.  Yeah, that one wasn't that good.  But the concept was pretty good. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Give a guy some acid, and then just have him go on a stage like that.  You'd think that would be a freak-out thing.  Yeah, no kidding.  There's another clip.  I'll have to find it for after the break.  There's these two girls, and they go and do crazy things on their YouTube series through Vice, I believe.  And they decide they're going to go to a trucker stop that has a strip club.  You saw that one?  No, but I read about the truck stop strippers or something, truck stop strippers. 
[01:55:30]  And they decide they want to see how it is.  And there's those two normal girls, I believe they live in Brooklyn or something like that.  And they go there into this really creepy strip club.  And the name of the club is named after the highway, so whatever.  It's like I-80 or whatever, I forgot.  But there's a guy that they interview that could be the creepiest human being I've ever seen on video.  Wow.  And he has a story to tell.  I don't want to give any of it away, but I want to find the clip for after the break. 
[01:56:00]  And it creeps them the fuck out.  Where was this truck stop?  I don't remember.  Yeah, it's that one right there.  It's called, if you want to look at it.  I mean, it's long.  It's 30 minutes long.  We're not doing that, obviously.  It's called Life as a Truck Stop Stripper on Vice's YouTube channel.  Do they strip?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, they're all kind of in.  If you-  Yeah, keep going.  I'll find the guy.  I'm pretty, too.  Maybe we can do this really fast.  And they talk to the strippers that do this for a living.  And then they realize they've got to do lap dances if they're going to actually make any type of money. 
[01:56:30]  Where are they?  They're out of New York, though.  I thought they-  I don't know.  Are they upstate?  That's the guy.  Go back.  They run into this guy, a trucker at the-  He looks like a serial killer.  This is creepy.  He looks like the stepfather from-  Oh, yes.  Or the father from-  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damien Echols' story.  Yeah.  The West Memphis Three.  Yeah.  This made my hair, you know how they say that, but for real, stand up in the back of my neck. 
[01:57:00]  This guy creeped me out so bad.  All right.  Just play it from here.  I think we might have it.  Next thing I know-  Oh, no.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back.  Sam, please.  Sam.  Bum.  Shh.  Bum.  Somewhere in there, maybe.  Oh, sexy.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's shot beautifully, man.  I love dumps like this.  Yes.  They show the girls stripping on stage with the smoke, slow motion.  Oh, man.  Bending over.  Great body.  Taking her brow off.  Are they totally nude? 
[01:57:30]  I believe so, yeah.  Oh, I like naked.  Oh, yeah.  And then they go to this guy.  Oh, damn.  This whole documentary creeped me out.  It was well done with the music and everything.  Yeah, it looks creepy.  And the camera shots.  Lonely truck drivers.  Truck stop.  I'm going to go there.  Yeah, this looks seedy.  Yeah, do you like seedy?  Yes.  This girl's just dancing in this very slow motion, weirdly done with the guy's hand in the money. 
[01:58:00]  Shut up, bucking her.  Really showing just how lonely this whole thing is.  Okay, here we go.  Listen, this guy is creepy.  I'm blind in my right eye.  How did that happen?  At 18 years of age, I got drunk.  I woke up at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego.  Wow.  Enlisted.  Next thing I know, I wake up in Vietnam.  Oh, shit.  I'm a pacifist and I come back with 112 confirmed kills.  Stop it.  I can't handle it. 
[01:58:30]  I sit down one day with a bottle of wild turkey.  And a .357 sitting on the table.  Whoops.  I drink three fingers.  I put one bullet in the pistol.  I spin the cylinder and it goes click.  I drink three fingers.  I put a second bullet in the cylinder.  I spin it and it goes click.  I pour three fingers.  I drink three fingers.  I put the third bullet in it.  It went off.  I was found seven hours and 39 minutes after I shot myself.  Wow. 
[01:59:00]  And was still alive.  I woke up six months later.  It's a nice fucking sleep.  What a scar he has, too.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Your dress is may not stand up on film.  This girl in her hair.  Pause.  Pause for a second.  Go slightly back.  Wow.  Yeah, this guy has the scars to prove it.  He ain't bullshit.  Yeah, it goes.  He's lying in his right eye because that's where the bullet went in and out the top of his  head.  He's got a massive scar, really creepy looking.  And this girl is just talking to him. 
[01:59:30]  And then after that story, he takes his hand and caresses her hair.  And then listen to what he says about the power he has over women.  Wow.  I was found seven hours and 39 minutes after I shot myself.  Going out.  I was still alive.  I woke up six months later.  Oh, thank you.  Your dress is may not stand up on film. 
[02:00:00]  Females don't realize that a man can make a slave out of them with just two pressure points  on the body.  Those pressure points being...  In the back?  Now I have captivated if I were to go in semicircles.  He's doing a tour.  Your pulveries, your uterus, and your heart.  All right, this guy's fucked up.  All we contact are porous.  If I were to touch the shield of your aura, it's a way of having intimate contact. 
[02:00:30]  It's where you feel my heat and I feel yours without having sexual contact.  He's got his hand over her, like, breasts.  Not touch her, though.  Right.  I was born a 17th century killed to Christ.  I have not been allowed to touch myself or be touched by someone else in a phallic situation. 
[02:01:00]  I am a virgin down here.  Wow.  I am not a virgin here.  I enjoy the beauty of other women.  Do I enjoy...  Pardon my touch.  Their touch.  Yes.  She's creeped out.  Do I enjoy their smell?  Yes.  Do I enjoy their souls?  Yes.  He's killed women.  And she walks away.  Great ass.  What's a helicopter? 
[02:01:30]  And then they go on to other stuff.  Wow.  That's...  Is that...  Is that...  Is that creepy or what?  That's pretty goddamn creepy.  Wow.  It's like the titty twister of that fucking place.  Holy shit.  Say hi to Ron in Indianapolis.  Ron.  How's it going, guys?  Hi, Ron.  You been to that strip club?  What is it called?  It's Club 203.  Yep.  That's it.  Okay.  Uh, yeah.  And it's in, uh...  It's Moriarty, New Mexico.  Um, and... 
[02:02:00]  We just kind of went in there as a goof.  But I'm almost positive I've seen this guy.  Because he's kind of one of those guys that once you kind of see him...  And I sat next to him at the bar and heard him talk.  And talking about making people drink shots of pub.  And just crazy ass shit.  We hung out, had a beer, and left.  But I didn't think we even saw the strippers.  It was just too weird.  Yeah.  There's a weird vibe with that place.  And with that guy just hanging around, it seems like he's there a lot.  Where is it, sir? 
[02:02:30]  Uh, New Mexico, you said?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh, Moriarty, New Mexico.  Okay.  Yeah, your phone's crapping out.  Let me go to, uh, Remy in Missouri, who's also been there.  You've been to the 203, Remy?  I don't know.  There's actually a few of them around the country.  But they're all pretty much the same creepy vibe.  I had one where they had a shower show where you, you know, wash the girl's vagina with  a soapy lupus.  So you get to wash her vagina?  Yeah.  It's nice.  It's helpful.  It's helpful.  Suckers in there.  Really good cheeseburgers. 
[02:03:00]  Oof.  Something about eating food in an establishment where you can wash a girl's pussy.  I only did that one time, and it was in a place in Dallas.  That place we went where they had the steak, uh, I forget what it was called.  Oh, it was called, uh, I was just talking about, oh, you weren't here, I guess.  Yeah, the Lodge.  The Lodge.  The food was good there.  That's what I said to the guy.  They said it was one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Lobster.  It was really weird.  It was excellent.  The food was excellent, and the women were great.  It was a nice, nice place.  It's a rarity.  It was a gentleman's place.  Yeah.  That's disgusting.  Let's go to Dan.  He's got a problem, I guess. 
[02:03:30]  Dan, what's up?  What's up, Dan?  Yeah, I never thought I would miss the terrible interviews you guys do.  What?  What's the matter?  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  So it was just you guys watching videos now.  Well, we were kind of describing what we were watching.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, I think a housewife on LSD is pretty interesting.  You don't need to actually see the video.  The hard talking was pretty interesting.  And then that creepy guy from the Truck Stop Strip Club was interesting to listen to,  no?  It would be mildly interesting to watch at home by myself, but not to listen to on a radio 
[02:04:00]  show.  Then I guess the show has passed your by.  You've got to move on.  Yeah.  How long did you listen to it for?  I don't want to move on.  I like the show.  No, no, no.  But if you're hearing a statement you don't like, why don't you just put something else  on and come back?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what am I going to listen to?  I don't know.  That's up to you.  No problem.  I've got other choices.  Something better than people watching videos, I guess.  And I'm looking for my entertainment.  You know, they let me down all the time.  And then I go check out something else for a little while. 
[02:04:30]  Right.  As kind of an aside, actually, my friend from high school makes that show for Byte.  No.  So why wouldn't you be supporting him?  I haven't seen it yet.  But he also makes Byte and Tattoo Age, which are also very good shows.  Do you know there are people listening to you talking, saying this sucks right now?  Yeah.  And they wish we would go back to the audio of the creepy guy.  So it's all relative.  Well, I know you guys, and I'll just comment on it with you.  Well, dude, the reality is this.  The audio says that the guy shot himself in the head. 
[02:05:00]  I think you don't need the visual.  That's self-explanatory.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That guy was downright creepy.  It was something I saw, and I decided to bring to the show because I thought the guy was just a real creep and worth listening to.  And we...  There's some things we play on the show you don't really need to even comment about.  Right.  That's just downright scary, that guy.  All right.  I'm sorry.  You certainly are.  No, we're not even...  Whatever.  I mean, if that's how you feel, it's fine.  I don't accept your apology. 
[02:05:30]  I accept your apology.  Let's say hi to Andrew in New Mexico.  Andrew, you've been to the 203.  Hey.  Yeah, a couple of times, unfortunately.  Is it a creepy place like they show on this documentary?  Well, yeah.  Well, I don't know how to necessarily call it creepy.  I guess the whole state's kind of creepy so it matches.  But, anyways.  Yeah, no, I stopped in there one time.  My buddy made me pull over.  Oh, it'll be great.  He fucking stuck a dollar on my head, and the girl on the stage took it off my forehead with her butt, which would have been fine, except for I had caught the most overpowering fucking smell of pennies. 
[02:06:00]  Pennies.  Yeah, that bitch was on her fucking rag.  It was awful.  Oh, my God.  It's horrible.  Vag smell.  Coppery.  That's great.  It was another guy.  And I tried to get a dance from a different chick, and fucking in the middle of it, she just starts fucking fighting with another ugly old fat stripper. 
[02:06:30]  And then, by the time I left, I'm pretty sure they ended up slipping my buddy a frickin' roofie at his drink.  I don't know.  He was fine when we were leaving, and then, like, two miles down the road, he was just gone.  Maybe he was drinking alcohol.  Right.  That's true.  Well, yeah, whatever.  My buddy can hold the liquor.  Right.  All right.  All right, Andrew. 
[02:07:00]  Anyways, punch it out, guys.  Okay.  By the way, also, with these videos, we do put them all on our Facebook page and tweet them out through our Twitter account, O&A Show.  Yeah.  Which, you know, helps the whole listening experience, I do believe.  Exactly.  So, you can see that whole documentary that we just played that quick clip from.  Very cool.  The gals did a good job with this.  Interpol identified second mystery passenger on the plane.  No ties to terrorism.  That they know of.  That they know of.  Obviously. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  And it might not be, but...  The mystery deepens.  Yes.  They're still looking for that plane.  A lot of people searching for that thing.  Yep.  Yes.  Mystery.  The guy...  That club where they wash the pussies.  What?  All right.  We've got to take this.  Yes, we do.  There's another guy that couldn't wait around.  They said it's either that club or another club.  They let you wash the girls' pussies with a loofah.  Sounds good.  A loofah.  Would you loofah my stretch marks? 
[02:08:00]  Greg in Illinois.  Greg.  Hey, guys.  That club that guy was talking about, just Club 76 in Youngstown, Ohio, they wash your  pussies with a loofah, and then she'd take a lollipop, stick it up her pussy, and then  try to stick it in your mouth.  Oh, I hate that stuff.  Don't do that.  Stop it.  And then right next door to it, there's a massage parlor.  We refer to it as a rub and tug.  Right.  Some old broad, they'll put you on this table and give you a table shower for some ungodly  amount of money.  And then you go next door and then whack your putt off to what you just think. 
[02:08:30]  Who wants to fucking put a lollipop in a vagin' in your mouth?  Yeah, why?  You ruin the lolly.  It's terrible.  When I was working at the Fox in Buffalo, we went up to the strip clubs, and we brought  our PD.  He was a cool guy.  And they did that.  And we were all like, ugh.  He had glasses?  So the girl had to wear his glasses all sexy.  Of course.  And then she's rubbing it on her pussy.  I think she even inserted it, and then put it back on the guy's face, and they're all  just smeary. 
[02:09:00]  Nothing worse than snail trails.  What's fun about that?  Huh?  Nothing worse than snail trails on your glasses.  With snail trails.  Snail trails?  I never heard that before.  The local Long Island strip clubs, the strippers would walk on the bar, around the bar, and  your drinks are on there.  And I would try to cover my drink, but not look like I was doing it, because I didn't  want to insult her, lest she not come back to show me her puss-off.  What was going to fall out?  I don't know.  With those girls.  You weren't going to take a chance. 
[02:09:30]  No.  Yeah, you got to cover your beer.  Let's say hi to George in Illinois.  George.  Yes.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that that guy that you're describing in the videos, I think he's full  of shit.  Maybe he is.  No, he probably really thinks that way.  I understand there's some that do.  But we're constantly playing stuff and going to the phones, just to try to hit on something  that we can now discuss and talk about. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  That's how this works in the end.  The videos that you were describing with the guys hanging from the high heights and climbing  up on...  When you talked about them guys climbing up on that crane, the hair on the back of my  neck was standing up to describe it so well.  That video was...  Let's see.  Wow.  That one was rough.  Yeah.  And I wanted to say...  And then I got to say, we got a bunch of guys that take these breaks and they sync  up the audio with the actual video.  And then it becomes a whole other viewing experience for the hardcore fans. 
[02:10:30]  They love it.  They love that stuff.  Yeah.  And can I say, Jimmy, I just loved your Netflix show.  It was excellent.  When you hit the punchline and smile great big, I think of that every day.  It's so funny.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Appreciate it.  It's for sale on my website.  And I asked for retweets.  And the only people that retweeted me were Opie and one other guy.  You noticed?  Bob Leib.  Yes, of course.  Oh.  And Florentine.  And Florentine retweeted you.  All right. 
[02:11:00]  He's now listening to himself.  Sal on Long Island.  Sal.  Yo, what's up, boys?  I didn't even know you asked for a retweet, Jimmy.  I just retweeted it, by the way.  No, I appreciate the help.  Sal.  So, I think he was talking about these fucking Long Island strip clubs, right?  Yeah.  My boys took me to my first strip club ever.  I turned 18 a few months ago.  And we went to this place, Lake Cafe.  How fucking gross and stuck up are these Russian bitches at these fucking Long Island strip  Yeah.  We talked about it. 
[02:11:30]  When we were growing up, it wasn't Russian girls.  No, they were all just regular Long Island girls.  That's a relatively new thing.  The last, well, 10, 15 years, I guess, right?  Yeah, it's a while.  I remember the transition, though, from regular local girls to the Russian girls.  And it was like, oh, what the hell is this?  They don't seem to care about me.  I haven't been to a Long Island strip club in many years, but they were never that.  They were pretty rough in general.  Never posh.  They were pretty rough.  Yeah.  See, if you go up to one of these strip clubs with all the regular girls, and, you know, 
[02:12:00]  they're talking to you, and you say, you know, no, maybe in a little bit, I'll take  a lap dance in a little bit.  They're like, all right, you know, that's cool.  And they come around, come back around.  These Russian bitches, they'll fucking curse you out in fucking Russian.  Yeah, and then they keep coming back.  Yeah, you know, they come up to you, and you're like, no, no.  They're like, oopsie blush, come up.  Like, what the fuck?  Like, Long Island's hilarious.  You walk in, there's fucking, like, pagans at the door.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking biker guys.  That'll rack your fucking head with a pool cue if you mouth off. 
[02:12:30]  They were fans of the nighttime attitude, though.  Were they?  Yeah, they certainly were.  The big black guys in the fucking fur coats, the fake fur coats.  Are they pimps?  Oh, God.  No, they're not pimps.  No, they're not pimps.  They want to be pimps.  Right.  And they're walking back to their fucking Toyota Camry.  Thank you, sir.  I got to move on, because see, it just sparked a conversation.  See?  You're seeing it work right in front of your eyes.  Magic.  Let's go to Paul in Canada.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul. 
[02:13:00]  Hi, A.  Good.  Hey.  How you doing?  I sell, Paul.  I got to tell you, Paul, I see what you want to say, and I just don't believe it.  So, good luck selling this.  He did the classic, tilt his head back on the stage to give the girl some money in his  mouth, and when she leaned over him to get the money and give him a view, he felt something  hit his eye, and he went, and it was all infected and sore and red, and when he went 
[02:13:30]  to the doctors, they pulled a crab out of his eye.  A crab.  A crab fell out.  A crab fell out.  A crab fell out.  Come on.  And then, it ended up in your friend's eye.  Don't they like to grab on nice?  They're not just going to fall out?  You know, you never know, though.  Did she rubber box on his face at all?  Rubber box?  Oh.  No.  She was elevated above him.  Oh, okay.  Because I'm saying maybe it got into his eyebrow or something.  That could happen.  Oh.  Well, maybe they saw him and wanted to jump ship something cleaner. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Right.  That fucking eyeball looked fucking very inviting.  You know how disappointed a crab must be when it falls into an eyeball?  Oh.  Yeah.  Nice warm anus to a fluidy eyeball.  It's warm anus.  Let's go.  Oh, that's terrible.  Let's go to Kevin in Atlanta.  Kevin.  Hey, so down here they have a very famous strip club called the Claremont Lounge.  Never heard of it.  It's shtick is old, fat, nasty women. 
[02:14:30]  And any time someone like famous comes in town, they have to go visit this horrible place.  Are you gay, sir?  No, sir.  So, um...  No, it's a southern.  It's got the gay voice.  No, it's southern.  I thought it was a gay voice.  Nah.  It's a little southern.  But look.  It's southern.  The most famous one of these strippers is an enormous black chick named Blondie.  Yeah.  And her two redeeming tricks are she could crush a beer can with her tits.  Right.  Uh-huh.  And, um, her bush, in order to get it blonde, she uses baby powder and hairspray. 
[02:15:00]  When she dances on the bar, it snows.  It snows.  When Anthony was talking about governor's drink, I had to see it.  Okay.  Google the Claremont Lounge and you'll see it.  I think that was in another Vice documentary I saw.  Because, uh, yeah, Atlanta's known for their strip clubs.  That's where that whole make it rain thing, uh, originated from.  Oh, really?  And all these clubs are competing amongst each other.  So, the girls are all coming up with new tricks all the time.  And I do believe they went to the Claremont to show the other side of it, where it's one 
[02:15:30]  of those places where, you know, strippers go to die.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  And I do, the documentary I saw, I saw an old, old, uh, fat blonde woman.  And she was still, like, stripping there.  And I think she was doing the, the matches trick on her nips and stuff.  Oh, God.  Nothing worse than tricks.  Right.  I hate a trick with tits.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Why doesn't she just dye or bleach her fucking pussy hair?  She powders it and then sprays fucking hairspray over it? 
[02:16:00]  Does she do all that in front of you or, or she does that in the back?  Old Thomas Jefferson wig pussy.  Right in front of you.  See, that's her thing.  Oh, it's her shtick.  Oh.  Yeah.  If you, if your body's falling apart a little bit, you got to come up with a little trick  to keep, uh, you know.  Gotcha.  All right.  Punching out, fellas.  Yeah, bye.  To keep your career going.  Good bye is right.  Let's say hi to Danny in Dallas.  Danny.  Oh, Dallas Danny.  Hey, buddy.  I don't know if he happened to caught it on TV, but I was watching the other day, that 
[02:16:30]  new show called Sirens about paramedics and shit.  And anyway, uh, happened to just happened to look and guess who's on there?  Bob Kelly with a bottle in his asshole.  Yeah.  We got to get that scene.  I heard about it.  Yes.  It's disturbing.  Let me tell you, since we're talking about ugly women and what they do.  Oh, see, he's implying.  Right.  We'll get that clip for our show.  I haven't seen, uh, Sirens yet.  It's actually home footage that Bob had to sign off on them releasing.  Is that one and done for Bobby or is he going to be on the show a little bit?  I don't see how they'd make that recurring. 
[02:17:00]  Bottles just become bigger.  Yeah.  He comes in every week.  We get a week.  Hey.  Uh, one more.  One more.  We go to the Poconos.  Actually, Scott in Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Um, just, uh, once at the conversation a little bit, a place we usually go for, uh,  bachelor parties for my friends.  It's called the Pleasure Dome in, uh, in the Poconos.  And immediately when you walk in, they kind of grab your cock and kind of start pulling  you toward the back.  Yuck.  Uh, try to, uh, to try to, um, uh, you know, get you to, uh, sit down and give them money. 
[02:17:30]  But you'll notice that there's a ton of girls that, uh, once they start walking towards the  stage, they start getting yelled at by the bouncers, which I could pretty much assume  is probably because they're either runaways or illegal or pregnant or have some sort of  defect that they don't want to make them actually, uh, headliners and they kind of get yelled at  and it's pretty amusing.  So, I wanted to add that.  Love you guys.  Love the show. 
[02:18:00]  All right.  I think it helped.  When did you, uh...  Thank you.  When did you phase out of that conversation?  Uh, a while ago.  It was pretty early, right?  Yeah, me too.  It was funny around the screen because it said they'd greet you with a cock shake.  A cock shake?  Instead of a handshake.  You shake your cock.  But he didn't say that.  No, he didn't.  He didn't say that part.  No, he didn't.  Nope.  Damn.  All right.  So, this, uh, this all started with the Vice documentary that we didn't talk about.  Sam.  Yeah.  Just went on a little, uh, tangent there.  We do have, uh, insight on the Pleasure Dome, by the way. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, yeah?  What do you mean?  There are, there are blowjobs offered.  Oh, yeah?  And fucking goes on.  I hope so.  Fucking goes on at the Pleasure Dome?  From what I've heard.  From who?  I heard a voice in my headphones that can't be removed past my headphones.  Uh-oh.  Well, you can't just say that.  Was it?  From what I've heard from Troy.  Yeah, we don't know for sure.  Troy Kwan.  Yeah.  Oh, he's not.  Troy is saying.  I have no idea.  That's what I mean.  That's what I said from what I've heard.  Yeah, you gotta say it that way.  I have no idea. 
[02:19:00]  I don't know.  I've never, I've never been there.  I think you could say that.  From what I've heard.  I don't think they'll have a problem if you say that blowjobs are given out at the Pleasure Dome.  From what I've heard.  Yeah.  What you're hearing.  Yeah.  My sources are telling me.  Gotcha.  Horses.  All right, we got the Vice documentary that we were going to talk about before we just talked about all that other stuff.  Yes.  It's on Ambien.  Yeah.  It's on Ambien.  Some dangerous shit, man.  Yes.  Crazy.  Supposedly, you're only supposed to be on it for a little bit.  A little bit. 
[02:19:30]  Well, yeah, the problem is with people, like, if you can get past the part where you're sleepy, it fucks you up.  Right.  It also, supposedly, you need more and more of it.  Like, people are like, yeah, one would work, but then I would need two.  And, you know, it's just a whole thing.  And you start making phone calls on Ambien.  It's just a, yeah.  You start cooking.  Yeah, we've done the stories.  Yeah, and Nicolini did that.  Oh, that was from you.  Jill Nicolini almost burnt her fucking apartment building down.  Does she remember cooking on Ambien?  She got up in the middle of the night, put a fucking pot on the stove, and started cooking. 
[02:20:00]  Started cooking, and then the pot just melted on the stove.  Oh, my God.  It has no memory of it.  No.  Wow.  How was the meal?  Not good.  I wasn't there at that time.  This was pre-Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  It's good, though.  It's like she was roofing herself.  Fucking nice.  Stick the tip in.  And then I went into that bathroom. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy, what the f-  That's not one dump.  Yeah, it is.  Jim, there is so much shit in there.  Yeah.  It's filling up.  It's like a big pot full of meat.  Just say it.  Big boy made a duty.  This thing is above the water line.  It's mighty like a glacier.  It's above the water line.  You can't see how much is below it.  It's like an iceberg.  It's racing towards the heavens in a statement, and the statement is, big boy made a duty. 
[02:21:00]  Can we put a party hat on it or something?  Oh, dude, I'd love to.  Hey, can we do, like, Mr. Potato Head with-  Mr. Shithead?  Yeah, let's do Mr. Shithead.  Could the interns maybe make little, like, things, like eyes and stuff?  Get in there, breathe it in, enjoy it, be a part of it.  Sure.  How much for someone to pick it up in their hand?  What we need done is, your hand would have to go underneath the duty in the toilet, pick  up as much as you can in your hand. 
[02:21:30]  You don't have to close your hand.  You just got to kind of scoop it up straight out of the toilet.  A loose little holding of it, and then go, big boy short did make a duty.  Short did.  And then when you drop it, you have to say, buh-bye.  And then drop it back into the bowl.  You, uh-  I think I'm going to pass on this.  200 bucks?  Let me have a little hat.  We've done.  Three hundred dollars.  Here's my hundred.  To talk to the duty.  Let me see how you look with the duty hat on.  Put the duty hat on first. 
[02:22:00]  Look at him and his duty hat.  Wait, the duty hat has to be bigger.  All right, the duty hat has to be bigger.  Can you make a duty hat a little bigger?  And you got to, like, get, uh, we got to, like, pin it down.  We got a big duty hat.  Yeah.  I like, oh, that's not a bad duty hat.  Which one?  I prefer the white duty hat.  I like that.  I like the big duty hat.  That big newspaper one is just silly.  I like it, though.  The big duty hat.  And it says big duty on it.  Now, you do understand.  The hand has to go, I would say, from the front of the bowl. 
[02:22:30]  You have to scoop under.  To the back.  And your knuckles must slide along the porcelain.  You're trying to.  So you're getting underneath.  You're going for a classic scoop.  You're not going in the middle.  You're not cutting the middle.  You're going.  Like a steam shovel.  You're getting underneath this thing.  When you feel the heaviness of the duty, then you lift up.  Then you lift.  And you present to the camera.  Keeping it above the toilet at all times, but out of the water.  All right, let's.  And above the rim.  And then you talk to, you address the duty. 
[02:23:00]  Duty hat, Jared, has to come out of nowhere.  He's just got to come out of nowhere and walk into the bathroom.  And then Sam follows him in.  Wait a minute.  How about his first line?  He runs out of the office and says, did someone say big boy made a duty?  Okay.  I like that.  All right, ready?  Hold on.  Good, Ant?  Ready.  Action.  Hey, Jimmy, what happened in there?  Big boy made a duty.  Did someone say big boy made a duty? 
[02:23:30]  No.  Big boy sure did make a duty.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Give him his $20.  Oh, my God. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, end scene.  Wow.  That's a wrap, people.  Bravo.  Jared.  Oh, my God.  Kids are in the pool.  Now back to the Opal and Antony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:24:30]  What the?  What the hell?  It's not my birthday.  Wow.  First Supergroup Asia.  First Supergroup Asia.  Dang.  Listen how epic this is.  Epic.  Epic intro.  For the first Supergroup Asia. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, boy.  I like this.  Sam, good stuff.  No?  Not good stuff at all.  You've got to wait for the hook.  Oh.  Stop being impatient.  I might learn something today.  The hook should come out from side stage and pull them off.  It's coming. 
[02:25:30]  Relax.  Oh.  Don't cry.  It's no Valkyrie, but it's good.  Well, it's in the studio with the Asia update.  Of course, the first Supergroup Asia.  When are they coming?  What day we got them?  Yeah, we're booking them for the third Supershow.  Yes.  When is the third Supershow? 
[02:26:00]  A couple weeks?  Well, it's all dependent on Asia right now.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, the Lee Singer went on the Internet.  He Googled you guys and heard a clip about you guys talking about Asia.  Oh, he must have.  All right, cool.  He said he heard you guys making fun of Asia.  Uh-oh.  And they really slagged the band off.  They really what?  Slagged.  It means that you guys mocked them a lot.  Uh-oh.  We slagged them.  Are you sure slagged doesn't mean good?  No.  You told them that with Sam Roberts, right?  They promoted the band?  Yeah.  But...  Uh-oh.  So what happened?  But the Valkyrie video is not up to Asia's standards. 
[02:26:30]  High standards.  High standards, I should say.  So we're just helping them out a little bit.  You can't film on a beach that has a lot of rocks and seaweed.  And you can't, like, film with the sun going down so low that everything's in a shadow.  I bet that wasn't the part that they got mad at.  No, it was part.  You guys were saying he was fat.  And we were saying that the song stinks.  And it was not a good thing.  And one of those guys from the band looks like he has dementia.  Yeah.  It was not a compliment.  And we're told him to just walk around the city and we'll film it and we'll just put it in our video. 
[02:27:00]  So what's the bottom line here?  Well, the manager goes, any suggestions?  I was like, oh, well.  He would come back to me in a few days.  No, that means you beat the shit out of my band.  But, man, we would love the publicity.  We need some fucking...  We need a push.  I say we work it out with the first super group of Asia.  I think we can.  Send in this clip.  Dude, that joke we did about that Asia video. 
[02:27:30]  I can't believe that that went over the air.  What nonsense.  That's a good video.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that so many times.  I was cheering.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  All right, cut right here.  Send that.  Should we watch the video again and make sure that we...  What?  No?  That might help.  Yeah, you know what?  It might help.  Valkyrie.  Hey, listen.  Valkyrie.  Listen, let's just redo that segment in a positive way.  All right.  I think we can do this.  Yeah, let's just do it.  All right.  In a positive way, though.  We can do it quickly.  Okay.  Am I just helpful, Roland? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, I don't have to.  Unless if he has on demand.  Valkyrie.  Starts off nice.  Wow.  Oh, it's the new Asia song, right?  Very nice.  I like that shot.  Going in fast motion on the water.  The sun going down in the clouds.  Daddy, he looks great.  Classic age of harmonies.  I like it.  Yeah.  He doesn't look too fat.  Not at all.  He got the sunglasses, the goatee.  A couple weeks on the treadmill.  He'll be back down to his original self.  Here we go.  Yeah, nice beach.  Oh, besides the shitty rocks and the seaweed.  Beautiful beach.  But we could sweep that up, right? 
[02:28:30]  Beautiful beach.  Oh, look at that well-shot video.  The guys are all there.  Look, they're going to black and white for no reason at all, but that's okay.  That's artistic.  Artistically done.  Wow.  And now they're in a subway, even though they were just at a beach.  That's okay.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Just the dichotomy.  Yeah.  Dichotomy.  Look at that.  He's just standing there with a white shirt singing.  That's what I like to say.  Nothing says fat like wearing sunglasses.  That's right.  And then, you know, let's get rid of the shitty seawall.  Oh, wait.  They can't redo this video? 
[02:29:00]  This is the official video?  Yeah, he's behind a seawall of rock behind the wall of public opinion.  Oh.  See, there it is.  Yeah, shadows.  And then you've just got a person walking in the background because you couldn't clear  the beach and keep everyone away during your shoot.  There's no positive spin.  Oh, this is great.  No, a rotting wall.  That's great.  That'll sell the song.  No, it will because it's about the old being knocked down for the new.  Here's the guy wandering around the streets.  That's good. 
[02:29:30]  Valkyrie.  Lovely song.  Excellent.  Now they're just showing the clouds.  Excellent.  For way too long, but that's okay.  I don't think this is going to help.  This guy is attempting to set up his drums, but he never really sets up the drums by the  end of the video.  I do remember that from the last time we watched it.  That's got to be a bit artistic.  Back to cloud shots.  Why not?  But they're in fast motion.  And now more crappy rocks on a really lame beach.  Back to the rotting wall.  What's wrong with this video? 
[02:30:00]  It's fine.  That's good.  It's good.  You don't come on the show, right?  Yeah.  How about now?  We spun it different.  Yeah.  A lot of people grow goatee to trick everyone that you have a chin line.  A chin line.  Yeah.  He's the one there.  What happened?  He's the guy who Googled the clip.  Of course he's.  He's the only one in the video. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, he's the only one that still understands reality.  That's a smart guest.  I know.  He probably was hoping to hear something positive.  Like, all the guys will love me.  Look at this guy.  He just got out of a subway train and now he's going up the escalator.  And now more clouds.  More clouds.  A lot of clouds in this video.  Enough with the clouds.  Especially in the whole Malaysian airline.  Well, we'll work on it.  Hopefully.  I still hold out hope that we'll have the first Supergroup Asia on the show. 
[02:31:00]  Roland, when are we getting this girl?  Next week, it looks like.  Yeah?  I'll talk to her.  We're going to get the dupe girl next week?  What's up, Mama?  Do you think I could have sexual intercourse with her?  I'm sure you can.  That would be nice.  I hope so.  You have the cash each.  I have some cash.  In a nice house.  I'll be willing to make a movie.  I'll just say I'm making a movie.  Yeah.  Open the pool early.  Yeah.  What is it?  $1,200 a scene?  Yeah, upwards of. 
[02:31:30]  Which means she's doing a lot of scenes for less.  I would do a few scenes.  Pay her a few grand.  No.  Just keep it yourself.  Yeah.  Just go, this is a movie I'm making.  There's no fucking SD card in the camera.  It's not even on.  But, yeah.  You know that Kiss has been saying farewell for 14 straight years now?  Kiss?  It's 14 years of saying farewell.  That's a whole career.  They started their farewell tour 14 years ago.  And they're still going around the world saying goodbye, huh? 
[02:32:00]  Yep.  Good for them.  14 years.  So, what?  2000.  Good for them.  But didn't we see them say goodbye in Boston, I think?  I think we saw them in Boston say goodbye.  And that was before 2000.  Yeah.  So, what was that tour?  Was that the first goodbye tour?  Did we see them in Madison Square Garden saying goodbye?  I thought it was in Boston.  Maybe it was both.  Or maybe it was Madison Square Garden.  I remember seeing Kiss.  What was that?  Wasn't there flying Paul Stanley?  Yeah, it was all that. 
[02:32:30]  It was great.  Was that Boston?  I thought it was Boston.  I thought it was the garden.  I thought it was the garden.  I thought it was Boston.  Yeah, I think it was Boston.  I'm not sure, though.  I'm not sure.  Could have easily been both.  Yeah.  Anyway.  So, what is this Vice documentary, Sam?  Well...  I didn't forget.  We're back on track now.  It's about the, like, effects.  Apparently, there are neurological effects to Ambien.  What do you mean?  It's curing people of things.  Like what?  Apparently, some of it, it's got the ability to normalize functioning in certain types of damaged neurons. 
[02:33:00]  A phenomenon called the Ambien effect.  Phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  Phenomenon.  Okay.  And this guy's like a voiceover guy, right?  Right.  And he got all his wisdom teeth taken out.  Right.  And then they fucked up or something, because now he can barely talk.  But Ambien cleared that?  Yes.  That's silly.  That doesn't make sense. 
[02:33:30]  Wouldn't it be more about the teeth?  In a small town.  Let's take a look.  Craft macaroni and cheese.  You know you love it.  I got you a Louis Vuitton.  Louis Vuitton.  That should make up for all those years I wasn't a father.  Craft macaroni and cheese.  She's one of my favorite clips.  She's spilling her guts out, and he thinks he can make it all go away with a Louis Vuitton,  because now he's making money.  But I got you a Louis Vuitton. 
[02:34:00]  Louis Vuitton.  We got that clip.  He's made one bad decision after another, Ted.  He certainly has.  What's his name again?  Ted.  Ted Williams.  Ted Williams.  That's right.  The homeless guy with that voice.  Yes.  I got to see the Louis Vuitton clip before we move on.  There he is.  I got you a Louis Vuitton.  It was when he was on the Dr. Phil show with his family.  Dr. Phil exploited him for a little bit.  You're going to see.  This is a long clip, though.  Dr. Phil.  I got you a Louis Vuitton. 
[02:34:30]  Whoa.  It might be right around there.  There's the Louis Vuitton.  What?  He said, hi, mommy, hi, mommy, hi, mommy.  Go there.  It wasn't the Louis Vuitton for his daughter.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's bring Ted in.  Okay.  There's Ted.  Everybody, everybody.  Hi, everybody.  Hi, Bruce.  Come on, let's just let's see him.  Oh, baby.  Oh, look at this.  Hi, Dad.  Hi, dude.  Saying his hellos. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, look at you, spitby.  These are all those kids he hasn't seen in a while.  Yeah.  He's been an asshole.  Oh, God.  What is me, me, me crap?  I guess that would be the younger, the youngest daughter.  That's why she's crying one.  I'm going to let you, too.  It's not really.  It's not really.  All right, baby.  Oh, Jesus.  How great would it be to be homeless and just get rid of all your responsibilities in life?  Thank you. 
[02:35:30]  I would rock.  Let's walk out on everyone.  All right.  How's it feel to see these guys all together?  Oh, God.  It's truly beautiful.  Truly my wife and my daughters and my sons.  It's too much, man.  Yeah.  It's just real.  Wow.  Anything you want to say to them that...  They got you a Louis Vuitton.  I know I'm so glad to each one of you.  I'm glad y'all hung in there with me and had some kind of hope. 
[02:36:00]  And you prayed that something not quite as big in magnitude.  But I'm glad y'all kind of stuck in with me.  And you, too, Patty, that you never gave up on the idea that there was a possibility that I had to feel something.  Blah, blah, shut up.  We're getting in too deep.  I just want a Louis Vuitton club.  We've got to cut our losses there.  So the Ambien thing is solving some medical miracles there. 
[02:36:30]  That's right.  Let me hear a little of this.  ...to speak.  Roe's career was ruined, and he was forced into retirement at the age of 52.  One night he stayed awake on Ambien to find his voice had returned.  This is how I talk now.  And so I traveled to Orlando, Florida to meet Tom at his former studio, Sunspots.  But I don't understand.  Wouldn't it be the teeth?  Yeah, no.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  And there's probably, I guess there's some kind of muscle nerve damage.  Right.  Like a yank it out in the root kind of fucking, I don't know, something.  And what?  The Ambien just relaxes that nerve a little bit.  I don't know how it works.  So you get those golden tones back.  It's a miracle.  It's a miracle.  It's a miracle.  It's a miracle.  I was the voice of the Circuit City when they were in business for six years.  I did a lot of Nissan.  It all ends tomorrow. 
[02:37:30]  That kind of stuff.  When I hear myself or see myself speak, it's hard to believe.  I don't know.  It was like a country song.  I lost my career and then my dog died.  And what can I do?  Other than if there was a job for someone with a speech disorder.  How come he can't talk?  I don't know.  I don't understand this.  Like he's talking sometimes.  He's not talking.  And he's holding everything together so he can talk. 
[02:38:00]  He's holding his neck tight.  He's making my throat hurt.  I know.  I'm looking at him.  I know.  What is he doing, Sam?  He can't talk.  No, he's talking fine.  Is he?  He was saying shit about...  I would use him.  For what?  I haven't voiced the channel.  I agree with that.  He just looked at me when I was like going...  She didn't know what I was doing. 
[02:38:30]  I don't think it's proper to be talking about this guy like this.  Yes.  Sounds like...  What was his name?  I don't know.  I'm Craig Schinkle.  Right.  Craig Schinkle about it.  Better to love it to have lost it to never have loved it.  Schinkle about it.  It's just cliche.  All I shinkle about is you getting hit by a car.  That's me.  Yeah, it is.  That's not the type of...  If you're really a body hero, you'll be a thing.  That's true.  Sorry.  I want to go back behind the mic again. 
[02:39:00]  But I'd like to speak without pan.  Oh, you're struggling, man.  For someone that hasn't experienced anything like this, could you describe...  Looks like Vincent D'Onofrio in Men in Black.  Trying to get from around.  Right.  Yes.  With the man's suit on.  Yeah.  He's a shitty studio, which means his business wasn't that great before all this went down.  Well, all he needs is a mic, right?  I guess.  It's a better studio than I have.  So when does he take the Ambien and sound good? 
[02:39:30]  You know you love it.  Let's go.  Now you're impatient all of a sudden?  Yes.  He's going to take the Ambien in real time and we've got to wait an hour?  This fucking clip is like Ambien.  It feels like muscularly.  Yeah.  If you took your bottom lip and pulled it hard.  Okay.  As hard as...  Maybe as hard as it could out.  Okay.  And then took your neck.  Okay.  Grabbed it and pulled back.  Right.  And your forehead.  Right.  And pulled up.  Okay.  I don't have enough hands to do all this. 
[02:40:00]  Exactly.  When you're a fucking octopus pulling your face apart.  And I feel everything...  It hurts.  It hurts.  The only drug that works is Ambien.  Is it reasonable?  Yeah.  He sounds like he's eating a hot potato.  In order to test Ambien's therapeutic event, I asked Tom to promote a Chevy spring event.  The GMB...  Oh.  Jesus.  The Chevy spring event.  And we're paying $8,000 off. 
[02:40:30]  I think he's trying to get a lawsuit going.  For what?  He's going to sue the dentist.  Oh.  Was it the dentist?  I can't hear me.  I don't know.  Didn't he say it?  Inside me, breathing that.  I know the rhythm.  I know the sound drives me.  This is crazy.  Unlike many brain trauma patients, you don't experience Ambien's typical hypnotic effect.  Nice take the Ambien.  He's starting to become inebriated.  Inubriated.  Inubriated.  Inubriated. 
[02:41:00]  Only one man will stand above the apes.  Tonight on WGM.  And you'll need to arm them with the skills, the knowledge, and the confidence they need to be victorious.  He's awful.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, he's funny.  He can't deny that.  He's tense, Ambien, relaxes him.  Yeah, it's working.  Yes.  It's not there yet.  Yeah, but you've got to be sleepy all the time.  Exactly.  Yeah.  General Grant was busy with his forces.  There was something going on deeper in the south. 
[02:41:30]  The sun had set, and although Tom had to fight a strong urge to sleep, he stopped.  That strong urge to sleep.  It's Mardi Gras at Universal Studios.  Oh, and you're going to love it, sir.  We're going to have a big time.  Who wants to hang out with him if that's the only way he can talk?  Awful.  He holds his throat again.  And now, with the Ambien in full effect, I once more asked Tom to promote a Chevy spring event. 
[02:42:00]  It's the G-Messer Chevy spring event, and we're taking $8,000 off your next Tahoe.  That's right.  Get a brand new 2010 Chevy Tahoe at G-Messer Chevrolet, and we'll take $8,000 off MSRP.  It's time for a new G-Messer Tahoe.  Try doing 8,000 Steven Singer gold rosaries, you fucking prick.  Yeah, this guy's weird.  What could he possibly have that would make that?  I don't know.  He's going to need 400 Ambien?  Yeah.  Maybe he needs a psychologist.  Don't put a politics therapist. 
[02:42:30]  Whatever.  Whichever one is the one you talk to.  He can't talk.  There's one that you talk to and one that gives you drugs.  I have no desire to figure that out.  What is it?  I get it wrong half the time.  One gives you drugs, one yaps at you.  He probably gets tired.  The yapper one he needs.  Because his therapist would probably listen to him, and he would start to...  And he gets tired of the therapist going, speak clearly!  Yeah, I can't understand you.  What?  What?  So that's weird.  How's it going to work?  He's going to take an Ambien and try to not fall asleep and get a few things done? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  That's good.  Snoozing.  That is strange, though.  What are they saying?  What are the experts saying?  Instead of this college kid who decided that he's got a good case subject for a documentary.  Documentary guy.  Right.  I think it's...  I bet you it's because he's fucking tense.  What could Ambien do?  Let's get the Dr. Steve.  There's a physician in England who's on the cutting edge of Ambien research.  Everything out of England is a lie.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Every news...  A bit of news out of England is lying. 
[02:43:30]  It's like 90% fibs.  They don't have accountability over there.  According to the Daily Mail.  Across the pond, they don't have accountability.  Oh.  Where's Dr. Rob?  Ah, Dr. B.  We have our expert.  Let's see what he says about the Ambien thing making this guy speak properly.  Has he been researching Ambien?  Until he gets very tired.  Mm.  Nothing worse than you're really tired and you've got to stay awake.  It's the worst feeling ever.  Oh, boy.  Driving's the worst.  That is so bad. 
[02:44:00]  We just get lulled to sleep and then you do that.  Ah!  I was just asleep for a second.  I'm hurtling down the road.  Nothing was in control and I'm in this thing.  What's scary is like the conversation you have with yourself where it starts making sense  to close your eyes for a second.  Oh, my God.  You could just do this.  No, just for a second.  It's okay.  I'm only doing 80.  It'll be okay.  Just in this fucking tons of metal doing 80 miles an hour.  But the logic.  Let me just shut off the controls.  That you have with yourself. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, yeah.  No, I think it'll be all right.  You could do it.  What?  Just relax yourself a little.  The guardrail will bounce me back on the road.  I'll be awake by then.  I'm just going to halfway shut my eyes.  Yeah, exactly.  And just lay back here.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve's in a meeting.  Oh.  One of his future corpses.  Exactly.  He's at a meeting.  It's a goodbye ceremony.  It's called a meeting.  It's a goodbye ceremony.  Yeah.  He has this ritual where he brings in the toe tag and he tries to make it fun. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He waves like you wave to a kid with the hand clapping.  His toe tag.  Yeah, we expect things to go rather quickly from here.  Now, I see that we went to the end of this video.  Is there any other stuff for the people out there?  Is it like Flowers for Algernon?  Does he start talking all wacky again?  Yeah.  It's wearing off.  Oh, boy.  Like that movie with, what, De Niro, that, uh, The Awakening. 
[02:45:30]  Or that one.  Yeah.  Awakening.  He tries making a house out of sticks or whatever and then this dumb handshake and knock it all  over.  That movie was depressing.  Yeah.  Giving everyone hope like that and then it goes away.  It was all fine.  See, I thought it was a great comedy up until they woke up and then it became a great comedy  at the end.  When fucking Leonard's all walking around, it's all willy-nilly.  Hey, this is willy-nilly and I'm walking around and I can't quit shaking.  How does it end there, Sam Roberts?  It feels like... 
[02:46:00]  Oh, he's babbling.  Oh, so you got to end with him being...  Alive.  ...awful again.  When I do that.  I'll do that close zoom.  You sure he had wisdom teeth pulled?  What started out as a serendipitous discovery?  Serendipitous.  May now represent one of the most important interventions for brain trauma.  Yeah.  With time and medical research.  Who knows?  It's a long room.  It's a long room to his brain.  We try to push along this research on Zarpidem. 
[02:46:30]  All the research that you do is actually just out of interest and goodwill of people who  are trying to find out what's going on.  Then we turn their eyes blue with dye.  These insomnia drugs are not optimized for patients with brain damage, and therefore  there is a lot of money to be made by people...  Iglesias.  ...optimized specifically for...  ...fucking Nazi.  ...for people with breast cancer.  I don't know what these guys are saying. 
[02:47:00]  I don't know.  What are they saying?  Audio Ambien.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right, we got Frankie...  Avalon?  Faison.  Valley?  Frankie Faison is coming in today.  He was on the wire.  He was in Silence of the Lambs.  Silence of the Lambs, yes.  Just the guy that sat in front of the little celled-in area.  He's coming to America, do the right thing, and he's in that Cinemax show, which I've not 
[02:47:30]  seen, called Banshee.  I don't know if anyone's seen that.  Banshee, Cinemax, original series, Fridays at 10.  You may know him just...  Just Fridays, the series finale.  Yes, Sam Roberts.  Just this morning, he was having car trouble, so he's running late.  Oh, hell no!  I was running late?  Adios.  Au revoir.  Huh?  Au revoir.  Yeah?  What does running late mean?  It means he's probably like...  He should have left the house by now. 
[02:48:00]  Where did he live?  In the city.  So he's left?  The city could be one block away, or it could be...  No one has car trouble in the city.  No one does.  I read the email.  Ah, ha, nah.  It sounds like a scam.  Ah, ha, nah.  I think we're trying to be scammed.  This guy's going to give us a suggestion on how to get Asia back in our good graces.  Oh, good.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  Hey, how are you?  Hello.  Yes, can you hear me?  Yes. 
[02:48:30]  Yes, we can, Steve.  Okay, very good.  Apparently, the manager from Asia sent you an email today asking you for advice on how  they can get the band back on track.  Yeah, I did all that.  So now you can just say how we can do it.  I know.  I'll tell you how to do it.  You revisit the first record because that was the best record of the early 80s.  You get Steve Howe back in the band and let him do his thing because all the other stuff  isn't up to par with what the supergroup was supposed to be. 
[02:49:00]  How many people have you said this to at a party that walked away while you were in  mid-sentence?  Holy shit.  We have no desire to have a serious conversation about the first supergroup of Asia.  Right.  I understand the bit, sir.  What's wrong with you, sir?  And I don't know if Steve Howe could do it anymore.  I think he's like 70-something years old.  Does he really?  And I believe in rock years that's brutal.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Dr. Steve. 
[02:49:30]  It's Dr. Steve.  Oh, boy.  A guy gets his wisdom teeth taken out, messes up some nerves, it looks like.  He says it's like his bottom lip is being yanked out hard and the back of his neck is  being pulled the other way and then the top of his head is being pulled upwards, something  like that.  He tried to talk and his tongue is sticking out and he got this.  Right.  And he does a lizard tongue thing, like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, as he tries to talk.  But he's an announcer.  He does the voiceover work and then he takes Ambien and all of a sudden he can fucking talk 
[02:50:00]  again.  Wow.  What's that?  Dr. Steve?  We didn't call you for a wow.  We could wow ourselves.  Exactly.  We wow.  We wow.  We wow.  We didn't go to medical school.  So we wow.  Dr. Steve?  Comment?  I don't like doctors just going, wow.  Wow.  Yeah, comment.  Yeah, Steve Howe.  Unless he's checking my cock.  I know Steve Howe is an awesome guitar player.  Wow.  I understood.  Yes.  How do you pee out of this thing? 
[02:50:30]  I have no idea.  You know, Ambien is an interesting drug.  It certainly is.  It sure is.  Yeah.  What they call, it potentiates this stuff called GABA, which is.  We talk a lot.  We've had a lot of GABAs today on our show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What GABA does is kind of quiets down the nervous system.  I mean, if this guy has all of those symptoms that you talked about, with him feeling like 
[02:51:00]  his lip was coming out and the top of his head is coming off, those are all neuropathic  symptoms, meaning that he's got damaged nerves.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Exactly.  And they're firing signals to the brain that are nonsensical.  They're saying, well, my lip is, you know, three feet long.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  And the brain has no choice but to just accept these signals and try to interpret them the 
[02:51:30]  best.  Yeah.  Is it similar to when you lose an arm and you still feel that arm?  Yeah, kind of.  A phantom pain.  A phantom pain, right.  Yeah.  Phantom neuropathy is where the nerves are firing, you know, still firing signals to the brain  and the brain is interpreting that as coming from the fingers that are no longer there.  Yeah.  So this GABA stuff is, um, this is worse than taking a fucking oral exam. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  The only difference is there's no hands on the back of your head.  So, um, uh, the GABA or the, uh, Ambien is.  Yo, Gabba, Gabba.  Yo, Gabba, Gabba.  Gotcha.  Exactly.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  Go right ahead.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry to interrupt.  We're just kidding.  That makes sense.  Now, this Ambien stuff is hilarious, though.  I've got a friend who, uh, who took it and, uh, he found himself on a ladder on the second 
[02:52:30]  floor of his house washing windows at two in the morning.  Fuck.  That is hilarious.  People just start doing things they would never do.  Exactly.  Well, it would be hilarious if he was washing windows and he fell out.  Yes.  Well, my wife would take it and she would wake the kids up at two in the morning and  play hide and seek with them.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what's that about?  That's a little fucking.  It makes you do crazy ass. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, it sure does.  That was her excuse.  She was building in an excuse for the time where she took Ambien and then played hit the  mustachioed man with the hammer while he sleeps and collect on the life insurance.  I'm building up a defense.  The, um, uh, what they say is that it's a vast minority of people that have those kind  of adverse effects with this stuff, but once the psychiatrists I talk to say once that  stuff starts, it doesn't stop.  Wow, really?  I don't know why I said mustachioed man. 
[02:53:30]  Do you know I picture Dr. Steve?  Right.  I know exactly what you look like, but I picture Dr. Steve sometimes like I pictured him before  I ever saw him.  Yeah.  Like he's a guy with a mustache.  Oh, right.  He had a big, mushy mustache.  Oh, you did, right?  Yes, I absolutely did.  Oh, all right.  Okay.  I sound like crazy.  All right.  All right.  Brother Joe wants in with you and Anthony.  Let's say hi to Brother Joe.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, Kyle?  Hey.  I just wanted to bring up the, well, what Steve was just talking about, the, um, you know,  nerves actually sending, uh, signals to the brain, even if it's not, uh, if you can't actually 
[02:54:00]  feel what's going on when I had, uh, my vasectomy done.  That's something that, uh, that's exactly what happened to me.  But the, um, the, the, I was laying there totally numb.  Doctor said, uh, I started feeling nauseous as hell.  You know, like, like, like I had a puke.  I had me really feeling shitty, like I was going to pass out.  And the doctor says, oh yeah, this happens all the time.  So even though you're numb, you can't feel a goddamn thing.  Um, you, the, the nerves still send the signal to the brain, and it's like you just got kicked 
[02:54:30]  in the nuts really hard.  Oh, I feel nauseous.  They slice, they slice the, uh, when they slice the tube, that, that, uh, that transmits  the sperm.  Yeah.  Anyway, that's what, that's, that's, uh, that's pretty much all I have.  Spermatozoa.  Yeah.  That way the fluid doesn't come out that way.  The sac won't produce.  Yeah, it's like, I mean, it didn't, it didn't hurt.  Semen.  Yeah, you'll ejaculate and air shoots out like it's an eye toast.  Ejaculate.  It was god awful.  I think on some level the brain knows when it should be feeling something. 
[02:55:00]  Ah.  When it doesn't, because you numb that area, it kind of makes you physically ill.  The same seminal fluids from the prostate.  Yeah, that's what happened.  A lot of times you'll have a vasectomy, and then cottage cheese just falls out.  And then into the vagina.  That is, that was disgusting.  The other thing, totally unrelated, that I wanted to bring up to you guys was, uh, look  up Pedro, uh, uh, San Pedro Sula. 
[02:55:30]  The name of the, the name of the, well, it's where we're, we're going to, you is going to,  uh, to play down in, uh, down in Honduras.  Honduras?  It's a town called, it's a town called San Pedro.  You're a drug mule.  That's drug mule.  Tegucigalpa was, uh, was, uh, what Tegucigalpa was, was not bad at the capital city.  Right.  Um, San Pedro Sula, I looked it up after we accepted the gig and I was contracted.  Um, it comes in at number one, most dangerous city in the world. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, God.  There are three murders a day in this place.  Uh, mainly due to like drug cartels and gang members, a lot of MS-13 down there.  And the, um, and, uh, it actually comes in, well, Kabul comes in number three.  Oh, that's nice.  So I'm going down there on April 5th.  I thought you told me the band was doing well, Joe.  Yeah, right?  You're playing fucking War Zones.  It's actually, it's actually a Harley Davidson rally.  It's a, uh.  Oh, good.  Bikers.  Honduran bikers. 
[02:56:30]  Jesus.  No, Harley Davidson, the company.  Oh, that is what you call a perfect storm, right?  Yeah, Miami Heat, the Chili's from the Miami Heat are going.  Oh, it's going to be like that scene in fucking Apocalypse Now where they bring the bunnies  to the fucking, right?  I was thinking it was probably your three amigos going to Santo Poco.  Oh, that's that great movie.  Feeling a lot more like that.  But, uh, this weekend we're busy as hell, too.  We're over at the Emporium on Friday.  Food Emporium.  Not the Food Emporium. 
[02:57:00]  No, Patzog Emporium, it's a rock club.  Patzog.  Good old Patzog doing.  Yeah, Colin will do ten minutes on Patzog.  Ronk, I'm at the conk.  Yeah.  In between telling us our interviews stink.  And then we're over, and then we're down in, uh, we're down in Bel Air, Maryland.  He's all right, you tour information.  Fort Lauderdale.  Well, notu2.com is where to go to find out where we're playing.  There you go.  For all your notu2 needs.  Thank you, brother Joe.  All right, all right.  All right, man.  Steve, Steve. 
[02:57:30]  When's your hundredth show happening?  Yeah.  Oh, look at this.  We're recording live on March 22nd.  We'll air April 1st, appropriately enough.  And, uh, Brother Joe and I did a little project together.  Mostly it was Joe's work.  It was Joe's work.  Ooh.  A hundred shows.  We do that in our sleep.  I know.  Why are you celebrating that?  I know.  I know.  A hundred shows.  A hundred shows.  Oh, isn't that cute?  It's in a queue when the podcaster's going to pull a hundred shows.  A hundred shows.  Look out.  Aw.  That's a career.  Oh, my God. 
[02:58:00]  We've been there for less than two years, and really, you know, I was talking to Anthony  about it.  I said, yeah, dude, we're going to do our hundredth show.  And he was like, oh, congratulations.  And I could hear that.  It was like, shut up.  Yeah.  A hundred shows.  Let's see.  What the fuck?  I do that in my sleep.  A hundred shows.  Only 74 suicides.  A hundred shows.  Yeah, we get it.  You guys do.  We do at least 20 a month.  So we've already done close to 50 this year.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Alone.  All right, gents.  All right. 
[02:58:30]  See you later, gentlemen.  Steve, I'm just talking with you.  That's a great milestone, for real.  Thanks, brother Joe.  Yes.  Congratulations.  Later.  And Steve was mad that he didn't talk about the Cosmos with Neil Tyson.  All right.  Yeah.  Cosmos.  Rave reviews on the first show.  Congratulations to Neil Tyson.  Yeah.  Eight million people watched it.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Really?  That's great stuff.  I did a little thing on my Reddit about the speed of light, by the way, just in case anybody's  interested in looking.  What did you write about the speed of light?  Well, just the thing that people never talk about is why the speed of light is that speed. 
[02:59:00]  Ah.  Ah.  And there is a reason for it.  It's not just a number that the universe pulled out of the air.  Well, I have a theory.  Yeah.  Because it used to go faster, but it got tired of getting tickets.  Boo.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, Christ.  Is that a good one?  Yeah, that's a good one.  I really should just walk up and leave.  Oh, they're saying I've got to go.  Oh, are they?  Good. 
[02:59:30]  Sorry, Alex.  Good.  One of these days, I'm going to find out why the speed of light is that speed.  Well, I can tell you.  You're right.  Why don't you explain dimmers, though?  Help us out.  Explain dimmers.  Yeah, does that make sense?  My lights go on very slowly.  Yes, and he means that metaphorically.  They go on very slowly.  Don't call me dim no more.  Off as they call me.  Go back to your chalkboard and figure that one out.  There you go.  So, Dr. Steve? 
[03:00:00]  Okay.  Remember that light is an electromagnetic wave, right?  Well, they didn't know that when this guy, Maxwell, came up with his equations.  Did he have a silver hammer when he was doing this?  Well, it turns out that since it's an electromagnetic wave, there's this constant that talks about  how an electric field can permute through space, okay?  Permute?  He served coffee.  What is permute?  Well, just how it... 
[03:00:30]  Can you count how many people can't talk?  ...at a distance in space, okay?  And that's called permittivity.  And then the same thing with the magnetic field, it's called permeability.  And you can measure these things.  You know, I found out I was cooking through this whole conversation.  I didn't even know it.  I woke up, started cooking.  See?  Because it's like ambient.  No, go ahead.  Permute.  Permute.  I'll make it real quick. 
[03:01:00]  That's a great vacation spot.  The island of permute.  Multiply them together, and you take the inverse, the speed of light pops out.  And so, when they figured that out, they said, well, shit, this speed that we just calculated  is exactly the same as the speed of light.  So, the speed of...  So, light must be an electromagnetic wave, and it turned out that it was.  Steve, that's not actually true.  Steve?  Yes?  That's not actually true.  Okay.  Fair enough.  You win. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  Okay.  I just want to sound smart.  Yes, well.  Okay.  All right, then.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  So, that's it.  Anyway, check out Reddit.  You can see our Steve, and it's on there.  Yeah.  So, fuck yourselves.  Oh.  Oh, hey.  That's good.  Some bedside manner there.  And where do we go to hear this podcast that you're getting rich off? 
[03:02:00]  Podcast.com slash weirdmedicine.  Very good.  Or iTunes or Stitcher.  Damn.  Weird medicine.  Yeah.  You got to.  There's permute, and there's permeability.  Aww.  And then, yeah, Saturday nights at 10 p.m. on XM 103.  Permutation.  There you go.  All right, Steve.  The great Dr. Steve.  Yes, we love you, brother.  Okay.  You're amazing.  They can't all be gems.  All right.  Weird medicine on the Twitter, if you got something wrong with your balls. 
[03:02:30]  There he goes.  We're going to break now.  Yes.  Oh, I was singing this around the house the other day.  Just walking around going, be ready tomorrow.  Fat boy.  Fat boy.  Fat boy.  So chair.  Be ready tomorrow.  One of the bands we bought beers for over the years. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Silverchair and Days of the New.  Or two, I remember.  They would always have them at our events, and then these poor saps would be sitting around  and going, hey, man, can you get me a beer?  I'm 15.  Yeah.  Wow.  I think these guys were 15 when they hit.  It's the 90s.  What were you going to do?  We were a similar age to them guys.  No, no, no.  You think you can keep on? 
[03:03:30]  For everyone waiting patiently for our Frankie Faison interview, it's not happening.  Are they waiting patiently?  He's got what's called car trouble in the middle of the biggest city in the world.  His car trouble is legit.  They told me what happened, but the fact that he's not hopping into a cab.  Fox had paid for his car, and he has a car service, which actually broke down.  Yeah.  So instead of just hopping into a cab, they're waiting for another, which is so stupid.  So that's why when you do that.  Of course you would. 
[03:04:00]  That's a dumb move.  Not smart on his part if he wants people to watch this show and its season finale.  Let's just call it this show.  Yeah.  I finished watching House of Cards.  Do you like it?  I liked it a lot.  Both seasons?  Both seasons.  I don't know.  Is there going to be a third season?  I think there is.  Because they...  I haven't seen the end of the second season.  Yeah, it was renewed before the second season was released. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah?  Because the way it ends is kind of like, hmm.  All right.  I actually heard there's not going to be a third season.  Oh, God damn it.  Yeah.  She made that up.  Spacey's so fucking good in that, man.  Maybe I did.  He's so goddamn good.  And then the guy from Major Dad was in it.  Yeah, that's where he's from.  Good.  Major Dad.  Yeah.  Doesn't it make you want to try to scheme?  Yeah.  Oh, look.  It's little Riley.  What the heck is she doing here?  I would gather that the Tefts are getting together for something. 
[03:05:00]  Doing a little family thing today.  Travis, comment?  No, she's just stopping by.  And then she's going to a picnic in Central Park.  Oh.  Is it going to be nice today?  It's going to be beautiful.  60 degrees.  Yay.  And then the temperature will plummet again.  It's all right, though.  We're done.  Oh, are we?  Yeah, we're good.  They hit you hard one more time, but in general, we're good.  We're done.  Hey, right, Brad.  Hey, right, Brad.  You're not going to talk?  What, are you shy all of a sudden? 
[03:05:30]  She doesn't want to talk.  Eh, she's bossy.  Bossy little kid.  Ben Bossy.  Yeah.  They're saying 18 million watch Cosmos in the U.S.  I heard 8.5 million, but they're saying 17.5.  Shit, come on.  17.5 million.  It's on 10 networks, though.  They're on a bunch of networks.  Yeah, they blocked it out.  So, I mean, you can't avoid it on Sundays.  Good for Neil Tyson.  Damn.  That's a lot of people looking at you.  I put together the video of him walking out of frame. 
[03:06:00]  It's...  Oh, yeah.  Didn't work.  Got to cut my losses.  Didn't work out.  He likes to walk out of frame a lot.  It was all right, but it's not worth posting.  Mostly, yes.  Kim Jong-un wins 100% support in North Korea's parliamentary election.  Come on.  That's hilarious.  What the fuck?  I understand these dictators do this.  Like, you got 100% because no one ran against them.  Yeah.  But can't they put a goof guy in there like the Harlem Globetrotters do, just to make it 
[03:06:30]  look kind of fun?  Nah, they don't want to take any chances.  No?  What if he won?  It's embarrassing.  100%?  Yep.  Of the vote.  With no one else on the ballot, state media reported Monday that Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un  was not only elected to the highest legislative body in North Korea, he won with the unanimous  approval of his district, which had 100% turnout.  That's 100% turnout.  So, imagine if you didn't vote, they'd probably drag you and kill you. 
[03:07:00]  You would be killed for not voting.  What a horrible way to live.  They should do that here.  North Koreans went to the polls on Sunday to approve the new roster of deputies for the  Supreme People's Assembly, the country's legislature.  The vote, more political ritual than an election by Western standards, is generally held once  every five years.  So, he's been in office five years already?  Really?  Or do you have a short term because his dad...  Oh, yeah, his dad.  I don't know.  Did he celebrate by feeding one of his relatives to the Lions?  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  Good for him.  Congrats.  What a great country he's got.  Sure.  Pitch black at night.  No food.  No culture.  Oscar Pistorius.  We're talking about him a little bit.  I guess he puked when they did the graphic testimony yesterday.  Old spatula feet.  But he caused all that, so why is he puking?  Well, it's confused.  It was very graphic testimony, I think.  Right. 
[03:08:00]  Of the autopsy itself or her injuries or...  Well, I think it was describing her injuries and stuff.  Right.  There's people that said he was freaking out when it happened, like in a way that you  would freak out because you accidentally killed a loved one.  I don't know.  What was he thinking?  First of all, you don't have to shoot through the door.  He absolutely did not accidentally kill her.  I don't know.  He fucking shot her through the door.  I know.  He's fucking...  Probably because hearing that stuff, in the moment you do it, and then you hear that 
[03:08:30]  stuff after, it's still upsetting.  He regrets doing it.  Sure.  He absolutely blasted her on purpose.  And he thought it out ahead of time.  Like, all right, wait.  If I blast her through the door, I could say this.  Right?  I don't know.  I don't think he premeditated.  It was just an argument.  Some premeditated things happened.  Yeah.  During an argument.  Yeah.  She was probably being a bit bossy leading up to that night.  Don't use that word.  So, he started thinking about maybe some things he could get done.  Yeah.  Where he could possibly be let off the hook.  I don't know. 
[03:09:00]  I think he was...  I don't think he was even trying to kill her, to tell you the truth.  I think he wanted to lay some shots through the door to fucking...  Stare her a little bit.  Say, hey, you dumb bitch.  I'll fucking show...  Yeah.  And then, uh-oh.  Whoops.  That sounds pretty possible.  Yeah.  But he's going for, uh...  He's in trouble because there's no jury.  The judge.  There's no shenanigans with the judge.  Because he...  The girl was hot, too.  He knows the law.  She's smoking.  He knows the law.  Yeah.  The jury system's really strange. 
[03:09:30]  I know it holds our whole country together, but...  Yeah.  Like, you're just a regular Joe.  A regular Joe.  And one day, you go downtown, and the next thing you know, you're supposed to be an expert on...  An expert.  On the law.  That's kind of crazy, shouldn't you?  Have to take a course or something?  And you get the education on the law as you're hearing the testimony you're supposed to be...  You're getting it on the fly, basically.  Yeah.  You're cramming.  Crazy.  You're cramming.  Yes, you're cramming.  I always found that a little strange. 
[03:10:00]  That is.  I did the jury duty a little while ago.  I didn't get picked for a case.  I told the whole story.  I don't have to reiterate it.  Did you have a jury duty hat?  I didn't have a jury duty hat.  Like Cream Pie Jones?  But I thought it was really strange, because the guy's explaining the case and the law  and stuff, and I'm like, I don't know this.  I think I need to go to school for this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is really important.  Right.  I don't know about this.  Maybe a traffic case or something.  I don't know, but...  For a goof.  But, wow. 
[03:10:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  That's scary.  I'd rather have, like, you know, a judge.  Yeah.  We don't get a lot of that in this country, though, just to judge.  No.  Not as much.  There's a few.  Yeah, I know.  I think you can opt for it in some cases in some states, right?  Say, I want to judge.  Got a lawyer who's representing murderers.  He says sometimes they break down even when they're guilty.  Yeah, I would imagine that's true.  Yeah.  Uh-oh, they found the plane.  Crowdsourcing.  They found the plane, Sam. 
[03:11:00]  Whoa.  I don't know.  I think you're lying.  You just made that up again.  It's like the fourth thing you've made up in the last hour.  Hey, it's Ocean Mom.  He's trying to fuck...  Isn't that what that dumb fucking bitch hashtagged?  Ocean Mom?  Yeah.  The mother that tried to drive her kids into the fucking ocean?  Uh-huh.  Ocean Mom.  Yeah.  This guy's better off with a judge, this guy's saying.  Let me take a couple calls on this guy. 
[03:11:30]  Pistorius, right?  Hey, Josh.  Hey, how's it going?  The reason I say he's better off with a judge is exactly the judge knows the law.  He knows what's reasonable done and what's not.  That people might take a motion into effect.  It's true.  And he might just say, all right, he killed that bitch.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He killed that boss.  And then where the judge is going to say, well, there's some doubt here.  Where the other people...  The civilians won't say this now that he's guilty just because they don't like him. 
[03:12:00]  Damn, you just turned me around on the whole thing.  Yeah.  Good job.  Well, thank you, sir.  All right.  I don't know.  It'll do you one day.  I actually did say he was better off with...  Oh, no.  I said he was...  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  I got it now.  I think a jury is much more likely to be starstruck by him and let it go than a judge.  Because a judge, even though a judge can see through and see reasonable doubt, a judge also  knows what is not reasonable doubt. 
[03:12:30]  And I just personally think that he's a better shot because he's such a hero in that country  that he has a better shot with a jury.  Like the OJ?  Yeah.  Or so many celebrities.  Look at the celebrities here.  I mean, you do go to jail sometimes.  Right.  But look at how many of them get off.  It's...  I don't think a judge is as likely to let a celebrity off because he's a celebrity.  Because judges are worried about being second-guessed by a higher court.  Right.  Whereas a jury is not.  Judges have a lot more on the line getting it right. 
[03:13:00]  But they don't let that emotion in there, you know?  Like people...  They might look and say, you know, fuck this guy.  You know?  Like, fuck...  That girl was beautiful.  You know?  Oh, he killed her.  Good-looking guy.  He should fucking...  You know?  Some guy on the jury that doesn't get laid.  Sure.  He's looking at this fucking beautiful girl and this scumbag killed her?  Yeah.  Fucking put him away.  Plane dropped off radar with no distress signal.  No distress signal had been sent.  Starting to, like, lean toward a little suicide action possibly, too. 
[03:13:30]  They're at least exploring that angle.  Man.  What happened to that plane?  Where is it?  They'll find it.  Yeah.  They'll definitely find it.  They will.  It's not deep enough in that part of the ocean.  They'll find it.  Yeah, they have to.  I think there'd be some debris.  Something, right?  Yeah, something.  It would break apart when it hits the water, obviously.  Yes.  So, where's the floaty stuff?  Where is it?  Strange.  You see...  In this day and age, too. 
[03:14:00]  It's been, what, three days now?  Three and a half days?  Yeah.  Something like that?  A long time.  Yes.  You see George Zimmerman get the Virgil treatment?  Yeah, no one came to his signing, like, 20 people or something at a gun show?  Oh, boy.  But they had to move it, right?  Because people were kind of pissed off, so they moved his signing.  Yeah.  He actually sat there just signing the gun show.  I think that's...  Jesus.  Because you're thinking about why he's famous.  Well, he needs money, probably.  That's what it is.  It's kind of creepy to get fame off this thing.  If he wants money, what he should do is write a book.  Yeah.  I mean, that's, you know... 
[03:14:30]  If you're going to do something, write a book.  Exactatick attackling.  He doesn't have that many Twitter followers, either.  Like, not that that's the big thing, but you think, like, wow, he's this...  Like, a lot of people like this guy, or surprisingly, I guess, the lack of interest now that the case has passed.  It comes across a bit unlikable in general.  Yeah.  I think.  People don't like him.  Right?  A lot of people don't like him.  Even the gun guys, right? 
[03:15:00]  Well, yeah, there's some gun people don't like him.  Yeah.  I'm an attorney.  Juries only decide questions of fact.  Judges decide questions of law.  All right.  So.  Yeah, a judge is also, yeah, right, is able to overlook emotion and just say, hey, look.  Yeah.  This is the law.  Yeah.  This is what we're looking for right here.  They are much better at that.  Right.  But I also think that they're better at seeing the law and not allowing, and who knows?  It's an argument for both sides here.  Exactly.  Did he shoot high or did he only shoot low? 
[03:15:30]  That's a question, too, because he didn't, say he had his stumps on or whatever, or he  didn't have his things on.  His stumps.  But he was shooting low.  Yeah.  So a reasonable person could say if he was shooting low, he was naming to kill somebody.  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  But they said he shot her in the hip and stuff.  But he might have been shooting down.  Yeah.  And I don't think he could expect to murder her if she was down.  Right.  So maybe he was trying to frighten her.  I think he was probably trying to more scare her.  Yeah.  Was she on the toilet?  She was cowering on the floor, I think. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, that's terrible.  I think on the floor.  Why don't you try to just get up really high?  No, that's probably the best place to go.  Not if the guy has no legs.  I would stand on the sink.  That's true.  Stand on the sink.  Yeah.  One of those furious, furious arguments, man.  Furious anger.  Now, now we'll have this.  All right, let's get out of here, Jimmy.  What do you got?  All right. 
[03:16:30]  Thanks a lot, Frankie.  Yeah.  We'll love you, miss it for you.  Go for you.  Virginia Beach, Funny Bone, March 20th through 22nd.  April 11 and 12, side splitters in Tampa after the cowhead roast.  April 24th through 27th.  I'm here at Caroline's.  And you can go to my website and whatever.  Ooh.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Why? 
[03:17:00]  What happened?  I was fucking annoyed.  Are you?  What now?  Well, what?  Just from the start of the show on, we discussed it.  Oh, oh, oh, that whole fucking day.  Well, even though we'll probably get yelled at again, I know we had a good show today.  Yes.  Congratulations.  Thank you, Sam Roberts.  Thank you.  Thanks, Sam.  Carry the torch for us.  We'll see you tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony show has drawn to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments 
[03:17:30]  of today. </pre>
