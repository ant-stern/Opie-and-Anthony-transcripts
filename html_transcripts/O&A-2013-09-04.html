<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts discussing Kenny's forgetfulness (leaving his phone at home), leading to a broader conversation about technology dependence, highlighted by a recent power outage at their beach house. This segued into a humorous debate about the redundancy of modern schooling given readily available online information and the absurdity of heavy textbooks.  The conversation then shifted to politics, criticizing John McCain for playing poker during Senate hearings on the Syrian crisis. They discussed a bakery refusing service for gay weddings and the ensuing controversy.  The NYC mayoral race and Anthony Weiner's campaign struggles were also commented on, including a played clip of McCain explaining his poker game and his controversial comments on "Allahu Akbar." The hosts announced upcoming guests: Patton Oswalt, Jake LaMotta, Anthony Bourdain, and UFC fighter Miesha Tate.

Miesha Tate joined the show, discussing her career, including wrestling on a boys' high school team, her success in women's MMA, and her role coaching on *The Ultimate Fighter*.  The conversation touched upon the differences between male and female fighters, the challenges of a level playing field in MMA, particularly regarding transgender women's participation, and the dynamics of dating fellow UFC fighter Brian Caraway.  She recounted her unexpected invitation to coach *The Ultimate Fighter* and fight Ronda Rousey again, expressing dissatisfaction with the referee's decision in their previous fight and discussing the differing treatment of male and female fights.  She detailed the pain tolerance of MMA fighters and injuries sustained, including ear shots and shin kicks.  Tate also described her experience with Rousey on the set of *The Ultimate Fighter*, calling her difficult, and expressed excitement for their rematch.  The UFC 168 event (Weidman vs. Silva) was also discussed, along with Tate's social media presence.  The segment concluded with further discussion of show staffing changes, including Gary's ("Radio Wizard") departure and Tim Sabian's arrival, and the hosts' mixed feelings about these changes.

The show then revisited Opie and Anthony's earlier work at AF radio, reminiscing about producing commercials, including a humorous Christmas commercial. They discussed a news story about a workplace lawsuit involving racial slurs, debating the context of the n-word.  They continued discussing workplace dynamics at their current station, focusing on Gary's departure and a planned celebratory event.  A brief check-in with Kenny, who still lacked his phone, and a mention of Anthony Bourdain's upcoming appearance concluded this segment.

Anthony Bourdain's interview followed, focusing on his new show, "The Getaway," and experiences filming "Parts Unknown" in various locations, including Quebec, Libya, Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, Tokyo, Detroit, Spain, and Denmark.  He detailed the Detroit episode, focusing on the city's decline and resilience. He also discussed other projects like "Mind of a Chef," and extensively discussed David Choe, a high-earning Facebook artist/graffiti artist, degenerate gambler, and podcaster, detailing Choe's personality, art, gambling, and travels.  The conversation included discussions of filming in Mexico (contrasting cartel violence with vibrant culture), Japanese toilet technology,  Japanese fetishism (tentacle porn and robot cabaret), and bowel movements. The interview concluded with promotion of Bourdain's shows and a comedic send-off for Gary and Steve, including farewell songs and a rejected participation trophy for Gary.  The hosts discussed the show's future, potential LA trips, increased creative freedom, a popular kitten video, and a preferred type of popcorn.

The show transitioned to a segment focusing on viral cat videos, one involving a cat and a taco bag, and another featuring a host's overweight cat falling off a printer.  This led to a discussion of Chip Chipperson's new humorous hip-hop-themed Twitter account.  The segment then featured Jim Norton's show, fielding listener calls.  Callers included a comedian with writer's block, a listener thanking Norton for his sobriety influence, a newer comedian seeking career advice, a female comedian discussing the challenges of dating another comedian, and a listener praising Norton's comedy and Middle East knowledge.  Other calls covered relationship struggles, an action figure collector's obsession, an Army veteran's successful online radio show, a divorce after discovering a wife's lesbianism, and the challenges of sleep apnea.  The segment contained considerable vulgar language.

Finally, Jim Norton joined Opie and Anthony, discussing fatigue, exhaustion, and suicidal thoughts related to his tiredness, mentioning considering sleep apnea treatment.  The segment concluded with a humorous commercial read for Mama Mancini's meatballs and sauce, punctuated by Norton's self-deprecating remarks and a flubbed line.

[00:07:30]  a year away but i wanted to kind of give him a little little yeah a little something different  clue i had to answer on speakerphone because my phone is broken because i've punched it so many  times my home phone why do you punch your home phone i had just arguments over the years with  girlfriends and i can't fucking uh that i can't answer it i hit i have to hit answer on speakerphone  uh no kenny forgot his phone so you you gotta you gotta imagine that his world is turned upside  down today he cannot even fathom like uh throughout the whole day he's gonna be oh i i gotta do this i 
[00:08:00]  need oh that's right right it becomes like the the light switch in the house when the power's off  right you keep flicking it and going oh wow what am i doing right because you don't have phone people's  phone numbers anymore you don't have anything you all the info you you take for granted now that you  could just pop on your phone it's not there now now you're just the same idiot you were back before  the smartphone and the internet we had the lights go out on at the beach house this past uh what  what i guess monday but sunday i don't know yeah i lose track of days out there and you realize that 
[00:08:30]  uh phones are really really really really important yeah you realize holy fuck holy fuck what are we  gonna do now ah we talked a little bit but it was weird now was this because you couldn't charge  your phones and they know the lights went out in the whole area for hours some asshole hit a  some fucking idiot the system is set up where one drunk driver hits a pole and and yeah yeah every 
[00:09:00]  town of long island has to fucking suffer oh so you were using your phones as like you know a little  personal entertainment there because you yeah you get in a group and it's like blah blah blah okay  well there was no wi-fi yeah so the computers are kind of down or the laptops and the phones weren't  working as well because you kind of need the wi-fi out out that way yeah and you realize uh phones and  electricity are really fucking important that breaks down and then you gotta throw the tv in as 
[00:09:30]  background noise you really do you get you turn all that shit off it is a weird world it's really  strange you actually gotta communicate with the the ones you love talk to people talk what's that  figure things out i talk for a living so i don't need to talk when i'm not here take more than three  seconds to try to remember something or figure out who was in that movie or who wrote that book or  something instead of just that fuck it of course you ever do that you try to quiz yourself when you  forget something you're like no let me think yeah fuck this you grab your phone google as long as you have 
[00:10:00]  google i think uh at this at this point school's a waste of time you know what everything we did  right everything we learned in school we could just now look up on a fucking phone so available right  so it's a complete waste of time for us yeah i don't know i don't know what the i don't know why  kids have to go to school at this point should have told him back then hey teach i don't have to  come here why well there's gonna be this little device that we hold right yeah everyone carries on with 
[00:10:30]  and it's pretty much got the entire knowledge of the world in it pretty much and uh should be  ah stop it all your schooling is now in this fucking phone all you know all right through high  school if you went to college it's all right there yeah what a waste of fucking time because i mean they  they made it uh feel like you had to remember all this shit yeah memorization and she would have sent  me home with a note to my dad he called me a mr sci-fi faggot so we call you 
[00:11:00]  don't you think school should be like one maybe two hours a day where you kind of teach the kids how  to do the google i i think yeah teaching kids how to google and a little that's about it a little  social interaction well i think that was socializing i understand social networking uh is pretty much  taken over where people would normally actually speak to each other right but you do still need  a little bit of that one-on-one and group dynamic thing going on yeah i guess which i don't think a 
[00:11:30]  lot of people are getting these days anyway i i would imagine uh schools are in a transitional period  trying to figure out yeah shit it amazes me because school just started what yesterday or whatever  yeah these kids are still walking around with 80 pounds of books why yeah there's no reason for that  we can't even get a fucking tablet no reason for the kids yeah and just have all the fucking books  now now loaded now i know the teachers are going to now call and say well it's very expensive for  the school district to get every kid a tablet but can't can't there at least be an option where the 
[00:12:00]  parents go hey i don't want my kids carrying 80 fucking pounds of books so i'm going to give  give them an ipad so how do they download all their shit onto the ipad are you insane opie why is that  crazy you know how hurtful that would be to the student that can't get it i was the student that  couldn't get that the special shit the poor little kid that can't get it has to be you always gotta  dial everything down to the lowest common denominator to make everyone feel included 
[00:12:30]  no one's left behind right that that statement drives me insane because no one left behind because  the mayoral candidates are using that one no one left behind isn't that america yeah that's pretty  much america it means you're gonna leave some people behind as you succeed right you know kind  of take off leave someone in your rearview mirror a little bit isn't that how america was built yeah  i don't mean to step on people's fucking heads and shit but step on their cake but not their heads 
[00:13:00]  oh shit oh shit did i still sweating over that one oh boy but i mean the country was built on that  that yeah you're gonna kind of leave people behind people if you work really hard you're gonna leave  some people in the dust yeah and you're gonna be a little more successful than your peers yeah america's  the big you know the big gamble right you could put everything in you could do well and uh sometimes  you're still not gonna make it not so much you're gonna not so much a gamble anymore people don't 
[00:13:30]  like that they want guarantees right pursuit of happiness no i want life liberty and guaranteed  happiness change it it's really strange yeah the changes are happening all around us  um the future oh speaking of phones yeah so uh i love the fact that john mccain was playing  online poker oh my god at the senate hearings yesterday they're all together trying to discuss 
[00:14:00]  this uh syria situation you know when when we finally do attack you know we're just gonna pretty  much make a brand new lake for syria and say see we we did something yeah i mean what the fuck are  they gonna bomb at this point they're gonna make sure they don't hit anything right and and god  forbid you know because they can't even take the chance that they hit uh uh an errant missile goes into  a school or something oh my god yeah because one dead kid because we uh forget about it you know 
[00:14:30]  did a strike against syria and that's gonna look make us look horrendous and no one wants to do it  at this point congress even the president i think is like oh fuck what did i say and so so they'll  finally be like yeah we're gonna do it and some mountainside is gonna get millions of dollars worth  of fucking cruise missiles lobbed into it they're gonna make a tunnel for a future highway yeah yeah that's  great and then he'll they'll talk about you know infrastructure and ability to wage war and blah  blah we've uh degraded the ability to and then nothing will have happened and all this time 
[00:15:00]  that they're spending on this that the president and congress are spending on this is wasted time  that they could be discussing things that are much more important to this country especially uh  right now but let me uh let me distraction let me say hi to this this all right oh this guy thinks  i'm a liberal go fuck yourself what happened there i'm a don't give a fuck i'm a george carlin 
[00:15:30]  carlinite i'm not comparing comedy i'm just saying how he thought and you're alive all right  how he thought about the fucking system that's what i like yeah listen to some george carlin bits  that's that's me i like that i like how he thought about things yeah when you're watching john  carrey um in front of congress uh with his frozen face his frozen face his big there's a civil war  going on between his two eyeballs right and i think the right one is losing to the left one 
[00:16:00]  he's a creep to look at he really is he really is ghoulish sorry i can't even look at the fucking  guy to have him trying to sell a military action to congress for the president is uh astounding that  that right there proves that nothing changes no matter who the fuck gets in that that office agreed  because that is exactly what the republicans were condemned for doing uh under george w and um you 
[00:16:30]  know obviously not the exact situation but so similar enough aren't a lot of them supporting him  like bonner supporting uh obama's decision to do it and so is mccain like some republicans are  actually backing yeah yeah backing well i think they fucked themselves up by yelling that he wasn't  uh looking for congressional approval and uh that he that he should do this i don't can we stop for  one second just because they're doing it right now on fox news i guess there's a bakery i want to 
[00:17:00]  support and i don't want to be ambiguous you know and what i stand for melissa uh in the past your  your bakery has baked cakes for gay people in the past but you simply refuse to do gay weddings right  you don't refuse you didn't refuse to serve gay people simply the gay weddings right right absolutely  why um you know our come on our faith is um we're christian and we believe in the bible we believe 
[00:17:30]  what it says and you know we're trying to live our life the best we can um by our then turn the other  but why is this a story that's why i popped this up i guess if you're a business and you don't want  to make gay wedding cakes then that's your prerogative she has the right to not do it  um in the wedding because what the bible tells me is that look it's against her beliefs and she 
[00:18:00]  they run a small business they don't want to make gay wedding cakes so just all right there you go you  have that you have that right in america she has the right i hate her for it but she does the right  right of course she shouldn't be forced to close i guess they're closing yeah why are they closing  she shouldn't have to protest and right do my art on so that's your personal belief and that's your  husband's personal belief and in this free country we would think thank you there would be tolerance for  your beliefs and for people who disagree with you but what ended up happening because i'm watching the  video now of these protests and people outside with signs and you ultimately had to close your 
[00:18:30]  business what was it the result of that that made you have to close um yeah i mean it really it  had to do with a lot of harassing phone calls mainly to the people we do business with wedding  vendors um uh just i mean just all kinds of mean-spirited stuff going on i mean we had  i mean we've got boycott pages up on social media we've got all kinds of stuff and the people have  the right to fucking protest obviously and but i will say one thing though this would annoy me if 
[00:19:00]  foxner asked this question if they were black and they weren't making them a cake are you going to  tell me that that fox anchor still would have said hey you're the right to your personal belief  uh yeah really you would have spun it the same way stop but you know i guess it is the right i mean  can't make them fucking no yeah i guess it's a story because they i didn't know they were protesting  all that there's the story okay yeah yeah i was behind on that one when you're a business though it's  a weird thing like if you're a business and you're serving the public like in something like that like 
[00:19:30]  it's almost like the pharmacist that wouldn't give birth control remember the pharmacist that  wouldn't prescribe right yes because of his religious beliefs yeah and i'm almost like you  know what take your religious beliefs and fucking throw yourself in front of a subway train if you're  if you're serving the public and you're discriminating against a certain segment of the population i'm  kind of glad to see you suffer even though you probably do have the right does that make sense right  even though i know that they have the right to serve who they want i mean there's plenty of other  bakeries that will make the the gay wedding cake so you know go go to those places and support 
[00:20:00]  those places but again i don't know if they do have the right to not serve people based on sexual  preference like if if a black couple walked in and wanted a wedding cake and they said no we're not  serving you because we don't serve blacks yeah there would be a civil rights violation right our  beliefs say that that that races shouldn't mix right right right so i i don't know if they do have  the right to not serve people based on sexual preference at this point i think they do have the right  because they weren't closed down for that they were just they closed down because of the pressure 
[00:20:30]  yeah well maybe they hadn't gotten to that point yet maybe no one filed a good question i wonder  if that's i'm caught in the middle on this one too because i hate them for it and i'm glad that  they're suffering and yet there's the part of me it's like ah you can't make people see it the way  you like you know what i mean like yes because i think it's right right i can't make them think  i can't force them to see it the way i do you're not allowed to say you're against uh you know  um gay weddings at this point you're just not allowed to right no no which is unbelievable to 
[00:21:00]  me you'll be looked at as very intolerant right you're not allowed to give your opinion on that  because they will crucify you for it yeah period we all know that now right all right sorry that  was popping right there so now back to john carrey so like you're saying you know yeah it's the same  shit basically same shit and uh god there's just so much other shit that's going on that needs to  be dealt with and and it's distraction after distraction and i hate sounding like the conspiracy  theorist guys oh they just come up with these distractions automatically to no but you know what 
[00:21:30]  we just don't have our shit together that's a mess right yeah but i love that john mccain was so  bored three hours in he fired up his phone and started playing a little poker little little poker on  his iphone and uh you know everyone is so mad and he's basically he basically tweeted tough shit  that's basically what he wanted to tweet he's like oh big controversy right i'm fucking playing some  poker three hours into a this nonsense congressional uh a little uh meeting but um i don't know if he 
[00:22:00]  could just blow it off like that people are taking it it's bad it's a pretty serious deal you can't be  caught playing poker no no i mean we all take we all uh you know take a sneak peek at our phones  sure but you gotta make sure you don't get caught and and the poker is uh he's lucky it was that  right because you can imagine what what pops up on your phone every so often imagine they caught him 
[00:22:30]  looking at some fucking porn or some shit oops yes i'm surprised you're allowed to even have your phone  in there yeah i mean they're big big boys so i guess they do whatever the fuck but they really  do do whatever the fuck they want at this point you would think everyone just turn their phones off  and focus yeah but those those things look fucking dry as all hell holy fuck it doesn't look fun and  then of course the new york city uh mayor race uh the debate was last night another debate right 
[00:23:00]  and de blasio's uh just running away with the democratic uh nomination here yeah yeah he's  gonna be the democratic guy what happened to quinn i don't know she really dropped off  de blasio he's the kid's got like 43 percent he's the guy with the uh the son with the big afro  right yeah that was that was strong on his part yeah he's got the son with the afro and uh and  wiener is just really he i heard he left the debate frustrated oh no why uh i guess they were 
[00:23:30]  just asking him questions about fucking his dick and like you know and uh his support for whatever  it is right uh is even less than it was so he's not doing he did it to himself i mean he's yeah it's  like dude you you got caught and everyone's like all right at least just wait till you're not gonna run  again i don't care if you fucking jerk off on the phone with the girl just don't do it when you're  gonna run again stupid yeah you know you're running again of course we're all focused on that it's an 
[00:24:00]  amazing story it's an amazing story quinn drops to 18 percent  we do have a clip of mccain explaining why he was playing iphone poker really this guy was almost  president i love it i love mccain he's a little wacky i love that he just speaks his mind he is a  little wacky you were caught today you know what i'm talking about uh senator you there you are there's 
[00:24:30]  the picture uh during the three and a half hour hearing at one point you were playing a little  poker on your iphone what was that all about well as much as i liked it i'm always listening in  rapt attention constantly with remarks of my colleagues over a three and a half hour period  occasionally i get a lethal board and so i resorted but the worst thing about it is i lost thousands of 
[00:25:00]  dollars in this game you what i lost thousands of dollars i probably well you know it was a poker  game and you know you play with play money you know that but you're playing for real you're playing for  real money no all right now they're trying to clarify that i hear you say you lost thousands  of dollars thousands of fake thousands of fake dollars okay sorry that's much better oh my god  wow he's just laughing it off oh my god he's fucking well how old is he he just don't do it he don't 
[00:25:30]  give a care yeah i did say fuck you he's gotta be 70 yourself early 70s i would say right i couldn't  stop thinking of that and we were we took the picture together you could see when he gestures a  little bit you could see like how his arms he can't has that full range of motion yeah i'm just  thinking this fucking guy was tortured for fucking five years in a vietnamese prison like yeah let  him play his poker what else like play your goddamn poker what a tough son of a bitch man like he's  earned that right oh yeah if he wants to play a little poker wherever the fuck he wants to play 
[00:26:00]  poker let him do it he also there was some other controversy with something he said uh i guess  people were saying how uh muslims yelling allah wakbar uh when they do things is is it shows that  the religion is is warlike and it's um this fanatical kind of a thing that they do and uh he's like that  all it means is they're thanking god he goes would you would you get uh uh have a problem with a  christian who said that for saying thank god i believe it was mccain yeah i don't agree with him on 
[00:26:30]  that yeah i don't either that's that's a whole nother thing yeah it's a whole nother meaning  they're not just going oh thank god the missile worked they're like ah they just fucking scream  it when they cut people's heads off it's a chance that they do do they do that same chance at a  wedding or something or you know i don't know actually they might right i would love to i've  never seen it in a fun i'm sure it's no fun yeah we only know it in the most horrific way right  yeah kids never yelling it in the ball pit you know yeah you're jumping around it's always bad 
[00:27:00]  things are happening you're special when you said that that was such a funny line thank you  for he's a jolly good fellow of beheading thank you it's one of the favorite things of mine i've  ever written is that a funny fucking line i edited part of that joke at the end i made a really  really weird decision at the end i do the thing on all the walk bar and i'm like because uh i've never  seen it in a porn and the whole thing i do is i act out the guy jacking in the girl's face instead 
[00:27:30]  of yelling oh god he's yelling all the walk bar and it destroyed but i'm like you know what i had  to edit for time anyway and i'm like there was a visual of me standing there pumping my arm back  and forth yelling all the walk bar and i'm like if you don't speak english and you don't hear that  in context oh all you do is see a visual of me jerking my arm yelling all the way oh you don't need  to get yeah i'm like you know what fuck it it's it's it could be a problem yeah yeah but uh i'll tell you  why i did that because a lot of times when muslims don't like what you say they're violent towards  you they kill you right but it wasn't it wasn't out of courtesy it wasn't that you uh were respecting 
[00:28:00]  somebody's uh no no and i kept the rest of the bit i wanted to live but when you're chopping  for a better way of material out i'm like okay and and part of it was it's it's it's a jerk about  jerking off in a girl's face like how many of those do i fucking need like you try to chop a little  than anything as possible yeah there are but there are times when you don't want to be redundant  and just be a sure fucking dick joke specialist great special thank you man oh yeah you were there

[00:30:00]  get him back into that surprise mode with it no one knows it's embarrassing it is you either do it  or you don't yeah they got some fucking hardware over there though i guess they sent a carrier over  and yeah uh five destroyers right i was laughing at the name of that the other day just kind of  fucking just name it a destroyer what does this thing do well man it's called a destroyer fast forward  a few years i think it's not gonna be called a destroyer anymore that's that's where we're headed in  this country yeah it will not be called the destroyer oh it's it's not a nice word it's a 
[00:30:30]  landscape changer they're gonna call out the landscape changer right yes right we don't like um  because because many of the times the emissions that these um ships are on are not to destroy  so we're changing the name oh oh my god that would be terrible it'll happen fucking it'll happen 
[00:31:00]  they start naming them like cruise ship names we're sending over the carrier celebration right  to uh the love boat yes the um the amphibious vehicle pearl of the seas will be of course making  its way off the coast oh you're so right what a bunch of fucking asshole there's no way that  continues down the road yeah they'll have to change it this country man we're fucking a bunch 
[00:31:30]  of pussies now i guess they're having troubles too in the uh some of the the branches of the armed  services are trying to train women for combat roles because i guess they're um they're allowed to  yeah and i i i guess they're having some trouble why well because many of the women just can't keep  up on that level that's terrific that's terrific i mean now you're gonna get the occasional bruiser 
[00:32:00]  that i'm sure will just do fine um but that is the exception to the rule i think i don't think  it's a very good idea to incorporate women into the combat um ground combat anyway logistical support  roles like that even air power i think um isn't a problem but uh when you're just talking grunts 
[00:32:30]  uh down on on the fucking terrain right uh wow but when they're on their period  wouldn't you get a fucking fighter you'd think you'd get a fighter but um oh man but then you're  probably talking about getting fragged by your own troops at that point shut her up  this is you replace her tampon with a grenade and pull the string this is almost hack i know  this is old school it's so easy but i don't i honestly don't uh because it's the exception 
[00:33:00]  like i said if there was a shitload of women that were really good at um equaling what the men do  sure on on a battlefield uh then sure why not but this is a situation where they're taking that whole  pc thing and inclusion and everything too far and it degrades uh the the safety of the country at that  point yeah and people you know we had a bad enough time when a couple of um support staff women got 
[00:33:30]  captured could you see having a you know deal with that whole thing prisoners and all fucking really  fucked up women that come back from combat and shit yeah you know we're not even talking about  the biggest story uh this morning uh the best by the way that cheer i was in a fucking violent move  when i walked in because my cabbie i wanted to strangle with a fucking phone cord yeah what did  he do to you he was he was i i literally almost said something racist when i got out of the car 
[00:34:00]  he was a slow driver like slow down and i'm looking at the clock and it's ticking we come down  7th avenue and he's supposed to make the left on 48 oh no uh uh from broadway to 48th but there's  that fucking construction happening this morning so this dumb cock doesn't see that you can go  like around the construction and go down to 48th so he makes the right on 7th and and then he's  trying to drop me off i'm like let me out of the cab he's like oh i can't and there's a fucking  he's panicking he's panicking there's no one on the road yet no there was traffic and he pulled into 
[00:34:30]  the construction area and um speaking of people who look like charlie brown on imus jesus fucking  colin hey colin hey colin is that a rerun yeah colin looking good and uh fucking so he's trying to  drop me off in the construction zone and then he goes down a block to fucking 50th because he's  to 47th because he's panicking and he makes a right on 47th i'm like just stop i was so  fucking angry and then i walked in the fucking car that's why i was livid when i walked in i was like 
[00:35:00]  i thought of him the whole walk i'm like i hope he fucking dies i never get that mad at caddies  yeah well you were ready to just yell something i was so angry and he wasn't even being nasty he was  just such an incompetent yes incompetent they've reworked all the roads around time square for the  people you know elsewhere and when you want to go left and your cabbie goes right that that could  easily add 15 minutes even though it might be only a block or two away yeah because they push you  all the way out of time square oh yeah and then you have to double back eventually it's the worst 
[00:35:30]  yeah it was really irritating ariel castro uh killed himself in jail overnight i think most people  know because they got their fucking phones but uh the ohio guy yeah yeah abducted those three uh  girls he was found uh hung in his jail cell that's how i'd be found if i was in jail  yeah he was on suicide watch and under in protective custody in jail against uh away from general 
[00:36:00]  population um he supposedly doesn't have any stuff that he can kill himself with but i think they  leave like ties and stuff laying around long ties just just within reach yeah yeah oh shit oops there's  some rope outside yourself fuck we thought he might have needed a garden hose right i don't know he uh  uh uh yeah but i don't i don't think anyone did it uh of course not but i don't know how much 
[00:36:30]  effort was put into preventing him right i mean if you're in that situation you know what what these  guys will use to hang themselves yeah yeah yeah you'd think right i guess we'll find out how he did  it within the next uh day or so yeah yeah but he's done ariel castro is dead that's good he is dead  it's sad he was sentenced to life plus a thousand years and uh you know he imprisoned those women for  what 10 years and he couldn't even handle a month in prison he was yeah right exactly what fucking 
[00:37:00]  asshole he was talking suicide right from the start well he wanted to off himself uh the whole time  yeah good it did it frees up a cell it frees up uh taxpayers having to pay for this fucking guy  i guess it's the second guy in ohio recently to to kill himself with another guy was um he was  scheduled to be executed the next day well it is ohio well all right yeah and that that it amazes me 
[00:37:30]  that it pisses people off though it's like we were we wanted to kill him tomorrow yeah roll on one  roll on two you know mayor menino you hear what he said about detroit yeah we had our issues with  this guy in the past and not even real issues we just you know said he was dead and scared his family  and laughed about it publicly i gave a half-hearted phony apology and exactly thanks jimmy yeah and 
[00:38:00]  wouldn't even let him throw a pie at you just to make good yeah we don't understand right  perspective yeah a lot of perspective right there jimmy's here for the perspective yeah thanks jimmy  yeah i guess you're right but he's a guy we would have got along with yeah what was he saying about  detroit to basically um did he say bomb it uh i think bulldoze it over oh bulldoze it over right  start over start over i'm trying to find the actual quote but yeah did the d the d he's not 
[00:38:30]  a big fan of uh the d uh and then yeah we had a little bit of a crime um up in your neck of the  nape there nape of the woods um yeah i i guess uh there's that bicycle trail up west side that goes  to the gwb yeah i've i've been on that a million times oh well that's my uh my track oh well uh  here's what you got to look out for now apparently a group of uh people right are stretching um ropes 
[00:39:00]  across there and uh when you hit the rope and fling off your bike they beat the shit out of you  and uh steal your stuff or they just come out of the the bushes with baseball bats and start pounding  where is this and uh it's the bike path from uh where we live and it goes all the way up to the  gwb i've done that oh of course yeah i've done that a million times it's one of my i love doing 
[00:39:30]  that this is why i really wish citizens carried guns and would just literally shoot people in the  face yeah in the face and you know yeah you go through some really sketchy areas to get to the  gwb uh-huh and i'm on full alert yeah i really am and i'm even thinking you know what this might not  be the smartest thing to do but you see the people like oh like they're just they're just not even  just taking everything for granted so i i could see why someone would set up a little uh little rope  in that area yeah it's easy pickings it's like being hungry and watching steaks just traipse through 
[00:40:00]  your neighborhood right right yeah because they're they're on really nice bikes and you know they  dressed apart and you know just basically showing everyone they have money yeah i go uh with my my  smelly sweats that have the crotch blown out you use this skunk defense on a bike that i should  probably upgrade you gotta you gotta be a little smarter yeah some guy last night i guess was uh  riding how high up is it i know this is getting way too local yeah uh i i don't they just set up a 
[00:40:30]  west side yeah they didn't say i know exactly where yeah yeah there's a stretch where you know  it's a little dodgy where the picnics get a little uh rambunctious and the music the reggaeton yeah  the reggaeton is uh is cranking from a million different cars they all they all tune into the  the same reggaeton station yeah and in general i love going through there because it's like you want  to you want to people watch wow but you got to be careful you got to watch because uh i don't know i 
[00:41:00]  don't even know how watching if you're just riding your bike along and they decide to jump out and  smash you with a bat right i mean what could you possibly do you also realize like you know they  just don't give a fuck about certain neighborhoods in new york city because i start the the bike path  is pretty much like uh paved in gold oh nice and by the time you get into the area i think you're  talking about it is pothole city and there's a baseball field there where they haven't they haven't  mowed the grass in years but they're still playing baseball yeah it's like oh all right i see what 
[00:41:30]  happens with the tax money yeah it um wow i want to know where that was up there yeah i'm not sure  really they they would stretch a rope across yeah just take a rope and stretch it across kind of  brilliant it's the old kind of smart well the coyote tried that a few times i guess also um steve  mcqueen did it the great escape yeah yeah and then some other guy did it oh i heard a story the  other day it was some guy was growing a little bit of weed you know growing some marijuana i forgot 
[00:42:00]  which state it was either colorado or california and uh he set some booby traps around um which were  like piano wire oh outside albany oh it was outside it was new york i think so and the guy was taking a  ride around on his atv around his little he booby trapped his property yeah he booby trapped his  crops and he chopped his own fucking head off right oh that's how he died yes i heard the trip wire was  almost you know invisible yeah it was a piece of piano wire oh it was and he said that okay he was 
[00:42:30]  wailing man on his atv right and uh fucking took his head off he didn't realize that's where he put  his trip wire i guess not and that's pretty fucking brave to do because you're thinking  someone else would do that maybe by accident now you got a fucking murder charge yeah i don't think  people care about murder charges at that extent no he's got a big crop well not just a little weed  for his for you know a little for my own pocket money these acres of pot wow yeah i think we should 
[00:43:00]  break early because we got uh misha yeah i almost said misha misha misha misha tate's coming in in a  few minutes here so yeah we probably should break we'll get into some other oh we didn't even talk  about our meeting yesterday oh a little meeting we have a couple minutes to do it now how much did i  miss yesterday when i left nothing our heads were spinning it's pretty much like yeah well we did like 
[00:43:30]  fucking eight lines of coke each just to keep up with them ran out and fuck yeah get suited oh jeez  well it is official um uh the radio wizard is uh moving on finance right i think so i don't even know  what they described it's like finance i don't know i think so but he's still with the company i  i don't know they it happens wherever we go they finally see it our way but it takes forever to get 
[00:44:00]  to that point i told them this is this needed to be done years ago yeah and they finally see it our  way i don't understand why they don't just see it our way when we tell them sam's got to come running  in because this is right up this is in his wheelhouse so we met with greenstein and he announced that um  gary's moving on to finance i guess what no what i don't think he's going to finance i think he is  he's lying i heard he's looking over some things like with people that are here already what like 
[00:44:30]  the talent like maybe to cut some corners i don't know i think he he's an expert in uh you know  crossing the t's and dotting the i's yeah i think he he's gonna have that job officially a bean  counter you know when it comes down to just crossing the t's and and popping those fucking  dots over the right lines to make eyes he's he's he's the guy he's the man so maybe just one of  those use of the right word because he insisted that he is not moving to finance no he's moving to 
[00:45:00]  finance so at the end of the he's moving to finance yeah yeah at the end of the big announcement  with rob and gary and blatter all in the room they asked if they had any questions and i asked them  who exactly will be moving to finance so they're all moving on rob yeah the radio wizard also known  as baldy aka gary oh what you said the radio wizard also known as baldy aka that was really never a 
[00:45:30]  nickname no no i was hoping you aka'd in another insult and steve blatter they're all moving on  after the meeting yesterday steve's like and i'm like i guess i don't know how to talk to you so i'm  going home yeah it's so weird when you realize like you have no no reason to talk to a person anymore  yeah now no more you know too but it worked both ways we looked at each other like oh wait at this 
[00:46:00]  point i would go into his office for a little chit chat i'm like oh oh that's right don't have  to do this so i'm gonna go home now no need i'll see you later bye bye and uh tim sabian's coming  aboard to run our channel and i guess other things i don't know you might remember i'm not sure what  we're allowed to say at this point but i remember him from the old ysp days yeah he's the tight slacks  guy he was too tight slacks guy he's great ass cheeks that's how we met him we met him he we uh  we're syndicated philly and we went down there for a little visit met tim sabian for the first time 
[00:46:30]  and uh to be honest we hit it off with him oh we always had a great time when we did our uh little  philly trips and uh he wanted to take us around the area just to show some philly history get us going  down there and he proceeded to walk around in his extremely tight slacks and his loafers yeah and we  saw he was a guy that likes to put his uh his balls on one side and his dick on the other oh that's  right i forgot about that yeah yeah yeah with his tight slacks it's good to know about the new 
[00:47:00]  management coming in right right right you know what we're we're assholes but this is a very good  move for yeah yeah yeah for us in the opian anthony uh channel so we like tim he's a good guy he knows  this shit the other guys didn't know this shit which we've said a million times so we're not no fault of  their own we're not speaking out of turn here they get put in these positions i'm sure right so  you know yeah this is good the radio wizard moves on with his uh participation trophy and uh we'll all 
[00:47:30]  be good do you think they all just fucking like all of them just went into an office and we're like  oh thank god yes of course thank god we don't have to deal with that fucking show of course it works  both ways i'm not here to to think that they're not trashing us right now here's how it happened  scott tim would be perfect for this job who is this gary why don't you let tim do this yes  tim should have the gig yeah what'll you do i don't know you got something finance whatever else 
[00:48:00]  you need yeah whatever else you need whatever anything else you need i'm a company guy i think  the channel will sound uh much better in in the very near future not that i think it sounds very good  but it'll be even better under uh tim samian so we're very happy i was amazed i'm like this is  really happening are you kidding me i know right because this is something we kind of wanted years  ago yeah years ago you know he uh understands the program right so are we gonna say goodbye to gary 
[00:48:30]  today we're planning on it we're trying to put something special together did we get the  participation trophy yet no we don't have a trophy why everyone gets a trophy that's not  to say we won't have one we we live in a society where everyone gets a trophy so he should get a  trophy period are you looking for some kind of maybe you can come in for a presentation at the end of  the show no he couldn't he he even knew what was going on and he and he couldn't even tell us as 
[00:49:00]  we're walking in the hall off the air he wouldn't tell you no i'm like good riddance at this point  you can't say like oh well you know go uh meet with scott  we have any radio wizard songs to play in a break  all right yeah let's play something you're gonna miss him  you know um it'd be good to say hi to him in the halls  i've heard people with um with chronic diseases uh-huh that after years and years have actually 
[00:49:30]  been cured of the disease miss having the disease although that uh uh what's it called  stockholm syndrome no it's not called stockholm syndrome what's it called munchausen yeah that's  when you're kidnapped and you begin no but it's the same principle it's an odd that's what gary  would have soul of this like if gary was a disease for us oh you you're talking about i thought i was 
[00:50:00]  from the wrong perspective gary is a disease gary no he is he was a disease the chronic disease  sabine is the cure hey he made cure yeah so you'll miss being sick with a disease right some people  actually miss that so in that way people could miss gary aka the disease  aka baldy aka the disease you know who i feel really sorry for who's that sal why because we're 
[00:50:30]  gonna we we need to beat someone up oh and you know we we spread it out because there were so many  so many fucking idiots around us sal had a hell of a meeting yesterday yeah what happened with sal in  the meeting honestly sal had a hell of a meeting during the first hour of the show oh what happened  he's just been having a rough time we've been trying to get some rough time of it clips together  and the ideas of timeliness are not translating oh throughout the staff as well as oh okay yeah 
[00:51:00]  because starting tomorrow we don't even talk about him anymore the radio wizard yeah he's done he's  all those guys are done and he's gone so you're saying nothing we could do about it it's bad news  for sal that there are less and less idiots because that's what i'm saying that's what you're saying  yes when you're lost in the because i know how i am right you're uh i'm in the category of i can't help  myself when you're a small idiot in a big pond right right it's uh okay you better get his shit 
[00:51:30]  together i would shave that mustache of his immediately so he blends in better he's realizing  there's room to do a backstroke in the idiot pod yeah oh yeah oh no clearing out the idiots you know  so i want to thank gary you know for you know showing up years of faith walking around with his  cup of coffee making believe he was busy thinking about the show constantly you know well yeah 
[00:52:00]  thinking about or worrying about i don't know i have no idea that was just a nice thing to say  never had a relationship with him whatsoever  no idea i've never even had no he only had my cell number the last uh couple months  i always had a nice time working with him yeah good for you there you go yeah i did 
[00:52:30]  that's nice he's pleasant enough travis what are your feelings just hanging out  just hanging out waiting to pitch something oh okay nice pitch something what are you pitching a ball  ever since he was a young boy he's been fucking bald his better instincts he just  clutters up the hall asking him questions like talking to a wall that egghead dummy doesn't like the show 
[00:53:00]  at all  he's the radio wizard but doesn't know shit the radio wizard is such a stupid twit  why do you think he doesn't like the show i wish that he would 
[00:53:30]  the opian anthony show sirius xm  sirius xm xm this is the opian anthony show  beth i hear you calling but i can't come home right now  because me and the boys are doing some radio  and i can't find the sound

[00:54:30]  how are you  what are you doing wow wait yeah we're on the air we just  oh yeah good morning  i wonder what let's get the party take you by surprise here  no not at all yeah  you were gonna come yesterday but they said your flight you had you had flight issues  yeah it was horrible i got stuck in minneapolis  not that minneapolis is horrible but it was just the whole flight situation  minneapolis is okay if there's a reason to be there but if you're in an airport  it kind of stinks an airport's an airport though you don't even know what city you're in  i didn't get to see it yeah exactly 
[00:55:00]  what'd you do inconvenient you sat there all night no they they bought me a hotel but i mean  it was really just like a few hours it's like a mile away so we just went there but  yeah first they delayed my flight and then they cancel it so after waiting around for like an  hour and a half and they're like oh never mind  they just cancel it on me happened so much and then the next morning the same thing i mean delta  was just like on a mission like i was never going to get there so i had to  switch over to american airlines earlier anyways anyways anyway it sucked yeah yeah like i don't 
[00:55:30]  know if the listeners enjoy that but i could listen to a bad airline story for i literally  could hear that for four hours and then what happened while i was supposed to be in c25d and  then they moved me to sea i love that it just makes me happy travels to traffic if you talk about  traffic if you if you got stuck in traffic on seven i could listen to that for 45 minutes yeah  about how the guy just wouldn't move yeah you kind of commiserate with it yeah oh  it makes me very happy well welcome to the show thank you yes yes look at you you are um  very uh built very beautiful i wouldn't spend time in the gym but i wouldn't you know i wouldn't call 
[00:56:00]  her bill i would i would call her attractive very i'm just saying that extremely like but but  very defined we'll just sit here and talk about you right for a while yeah awkward yeah sorry i  wouldn't doubt it does that annoy you when guys do that because we all do it i mean we all like  looking oh god she's a beautiful fighter do you does that like irritating no i'd rather be that than 
[00:56:30]  like oh god that's the butch fighter like you know you know it could be worse yeah just look at the  glass half full who's the other one cyborg uh she's not yeah she's not the most she's uh she's built  yeah yeah yeah she's built not the most delightful looking gal wow what a surprise with a name like  cyborg cyborg yeah you'd expect her to be a real right a real a real haughty nobody even like knows  her real name you know i do because i like follow it but like yeah nobody everyone's like cyborg when 
[00:57:00]  did you realize you could like beat the shit out of people um i don't know i started wrestling when  i was in high school and i wrestled on the guys team oh really yeah and i must have been interesting  to say the least quit and i kind of got a good idea then wow you know i was i like combat sports and  then when i went to college i found mma and i didn't think i wanted to fight at first because  i was like yeah i don't want to get punched in the face you know like total typical girl reaction  but then uh that's my reaction as well well we have girl reactions to that i don't get hit in the 
[00:57:30]  face yes i don't think anyone enjoys that no it sucks and then i watched my first event and i  learned a lot more about the sport and i was like i man if they could do it i could do it so i wanted  to and well who's the first guy you wrestled and i want to get back to high school because like  you want to wrestle what do you like your brothers you just realized you were stronger  than most guys or like how did it come out it's actually i mean kind of a funny story i was sitting  in english class and uh it was my first year of high school obviously so in the winter the only sport 
[00:58:00]  offered was basketball and wrestling and i cannot play basketball to save my life i don't like it i suck  at it i'm terrible forget it they would have cut me from the c team so i mean it was just like hopeless  so i kind of went out for wrestling out of default okay because i wanted something to do i wanted to  play some sport and the only sport offered was basketball for women and so i was like well  screw that i'm gonna go for wrestling didn't you make the local news no because usually nobody cared  back then i know there's like this who's this weirdo like weird chick that wants to wrestle like 
[00:58:30]  you know did you the first time you wrestled a guy though i mean did they take it easy on you at  first or try to because they didn't want to um you know they didn't want to hurt you and then they  realized oh they really had to wrestle to beat you i think it depends on the guy like a lot of  them i found were very nervous so like they would shoot like right off the bat so i'd have to be  ready for like a bulldozer to hit me like every time that we wrestled because they did not want to  lose you know like like in dire need to like win so yeah and they wanted to win quickly yeah oh okay 
[00:59:00]  because the idea of losing what was your record did you win most of your matches in high school no because  i i just didn't um have much experience you know i was a freshman and most of these guys have been  wrestling since they were little little you know and i actually ended up wrestling varsity my senior  year um so uh i did well i only got pinned once you know in my senior year wrestling the varsity  matches but i beat all the girls that i wrestled and it wasn't like a ton but you know i uh they had  in washington state they had a women's state wrestling championship my senior year and uh i won that and 
[00:59:30]  so i got to wrestle a few women what wrestling for women in in washington's um pretty big yeah  it's gotten a lot bigger actually my high school now has a full women's team well you're wrestling  a guy though like is he obsessed with like losing in front of it because that really like as a guy  the worst thing you can do is have a girl pin you like i mean again i'm in front of everybody yeah  from a high school point you were responsible for how many dads smacking their sons when they got  home i got lost to a girl poor guys yeah yeah do you remember the first guy you beat publicly 
[01:00:00]  yeah how did he react not too well their team told the team like told me later that he didn't come  back to practice he just quit oh wow oh man he was just like that was this so heartbroken although  they're probably now though looking back and going well that's the one that beat me that's you know  at least they know now that it was a real now he's probably proud of it a little vindication  that girl in high school and she totally pinned me yeah well no doubt she pinned me 
[01:00:30]  now he's like now he's got credibility yeah right of course of course i was supposed to lose  do you so do you is that the type of you do you only like like alpha male guys is that like your  main thing or do you kind of go like opposite guys well i've been dating a fighter for quite a few  years now so um he fights in the ufc as well right but um i like personality you know like if you're  funny if you can make me laugh you know that's probably one of the biggest things but i  i don't i definitely couldn't see myself ever with like a couch potato right to be active in  some way shape or form it's like a surfer like you know anything hiking and uh you know someone 
[01:01:00]  who's secure enough because i think a lot of guys would be too insecure to like date a woman that  could kick their ass i completely agree yeah i would find that really just weird like i thought you  would ever do that but it would just it would just feel i don't know strange right because there's  always that weird dynamic in an argument between a man and a woman that if it gets heated it's  always the man deciding okay i'm going to not dominate you physically and we don't because  we're civilized and that's just not how we act but to literally be arguing i'm thinking of my 
[01:01:30]  ex-girlfriend and if she could have beaten me i'd be dead if she could if she could kick my ass i  would be a dead person like lack that sensor i think it's like it's okay because they can't you  you know hurt you or whatever but yeah i don't see it that way so i have to see oh jimmy jimmy  you okay nothing to worry about you just sneezed on the guest no i just all right so yeah okay so  you date a fighter that's uh who's who's i guess that's an odd question but uh when you argue do you 
[01:02:00]  guys get heated or is it or do you both know that this could get ugly very quickly oh yeah we we're  definitely like you know we we have our boundaries and whatnot because obviously we're both very very  physically strong and that would be terrible like and i'm so stubborn he'd probably be like kicking  my ass and i would still be like fuck you like you know i'm like you're gonna have to kill me like  i would totally have that like mentality like if you're not prepared to kill me you better not get  in this right this fight right now yeah imagine the neighbors just hearing hearing that yeah you  should just see our disputes when it comes to doing the dishes you know well is he a good fighter 
[01:02:30]  yeah yeah he's actually a very good fighter do you say his name publicly yeah brian carraway okay  i know the name i don't know brian yeah he was on season 14 of the ultimate fighter and right now  he's ranked uh i think right outside the top 10. okay so he's working his way nice working his way  up there it's a lot harder for the guys because there's a lot more obviously way more men that fight  so well you call did you coach this season of the ultimate fighter is that why you're promoting right  uh yeah okay i did which is premieres today oh wow okay i should probably know that 
[01:03:00]  do your homework yeah right we have the prep sheet i did we usually do we're just getting back  into this again we're just back from vacation for a week i i should just call this house she's  right yeah she's calling absolutely right she's calling us out on our dogshit show prep well  so you're a boxer yeah you're right please don't hurt us it airs on fox sports one for you guys's  information at 10 o'clock eastern time and it's gonna be badass i got to watch the first uh the first 
[01:03:30]  episode so it's a two-hour premiere and there are 16 fighters um excuse me 32 fighters and they all  fight to get in the house 16 of them make it and yeah it's exciting and it's you and rhonda it is  yeah and how many men and how many women are there as fighters didn't they mix them this time yeah half  and half so we have we had teams of eight so four and four on each team i think it's like i guess it's  just not enough uh female fighters to have is that what it is they can't have a full house it's just not  enough i guess so but i mean there was there was enough when they uh they brought 32 in and they cut 
[01:04:00]  half of them so technically they could have you know filled the house with them but i think they  were looking for more more quality you know they wanted to make sure everyone in there was legit so  and it was no difficulty coaching men right they didn't have any problems they did any of them have  any issues listening to you or not too much i remember at one point one of the fighters um  i i wanted to work on like the game plan and i was gonna mimic his uh his partner and he kind of just  like looked at me for a second was like i'm not really like i'm not really sure like about this i don't 
[01:04:30]  think he'd ever train with a girl but he did it and then um i mean it was great you know we had a  really good group good workout and i felt like uh he got a lot out of it and he was happy you know so  it was just kind of like awkward at first like he wasn't he didn't know what to think of it wow  but uh yeah i mean other than that no they listened great and uh they were all very coachable and and a  really really nice uh team of people do they do any like uh you know i guess if you're fighting it's 
[01:05:00]  different like but you never caught anybody trying like a man wrestling you're trying to  you know grope well yeah i mean it's it's a natural thing to do because in you know when  they don't have time to do that they're focused on that they're gonna get choked out really quick  well worth it yeah i guess that's the problem i would make sure they didn't remember it  yeah that's for sure so yeah i suppose yeah that would be a credit penalty to pay for that if you grab  something and you're fucking arm barred probably not be worth it yeah do you think there would be uh  women versus men uh fighting in the uh in the future no i don't think so no because it's just 
[01:05:30]  i mean i mean not unless you want some kind of freak show but it's not i mean it's just not  i don't know i think it would be stupid yeah personally i mean men and women are different  we have different chemicals running through our veins and whatnot and that's fine there's nothing  wrong with that i don't see it as you know like anything to be frowned upon but you know because i  think a woman versus a woman is equal and i think they make for great fights and we're trying to  entertain so it doesn't matter that physically maybe we're not quite a strong pound for pound 
[01:06:00]  because we're just as awesome so more awesome pound for pound yeah they don't even have men  versus women in chess really they have a men's champion and a woman's champion and it's like  well that's yeah that they could probably that's just because probably some man doesn't want to  lose to a woman they probably can figure that one out right at least start there sounds like  something that that we could probably do i i mean grappling um i think men versus women you know  is is good you know i like that because there's no like blow for blow but just punching in the face 
[01:06:30]  yeah yeah it's different so how do you feel about uh because joe got in some rogan got in some trouble  when he talked about who's the fighter the trans transsexual or had the full surgery who started  started out as a male and now is completely female but joe raised the point that like bone structure is  different you're it's not just about you you're a woman and hormones you know your  bones are different and joints and like ligaments and all that stuff is that yeah it is and like  men are born with a bigger vascular system so they're a little bit more efficient as at uh moving 
[01:07:00]  the blood through there and the recuperating and also not just that but think about our sport involves  weight and cutting weight and men have more sweat glands than women do and it's easier for them to  push out water weight so potentially she could cut a lot more weight whereas a woman wouldn't be  able to do that as effectively so it's just other you know advantages that i think you you can't  make completely even in a full contact physical yeah you can't really change it yeah exactly so what  are they going to do what are you gonna get that yeah what is happening with her yeah man it's it's 
[01:07:30]  all about the athletic commission i think florida athletic commission is allowing her to fight women  so each state is different um i don't know but that's an interesting point if you can cut weight  easier and do all these things that have nothing to do with political correctness or politeness or  you know being fair yeah i'm all for i mean for for her to live her life and you know i mean be  respected as her wishes and whatnot but when it comes to some other some other woman's safety i don't  know if i feel like you know full-heartedly i guess it would have to be more research done you 
[01:08:00]  know what i mean if those things can be completely reversed and to to be able to actually have a  uh you know medical doctors say that yes she is a hundred percent like a natural born woman  until i could get that kind of like reassurance then i would be a little bit spectacular you know  yeah exactly or fight other like transsexual women like then you know that sounds a little  like a circus sounds like a video i'd run but you know what i mean like let then at least there's that 
[01:08:30]  equal that equal starting out place and that equal i think you're going to be waiting around a long  time yeah i mean that might be a little bit too yeah i don't think there's that many we found one  yeah yeah found another found another maybe that's a little too specific i don't know just a tad and you  were not supposed to it wasn't it supposed to uh like according to the way the the rules were  structured you was you fought cat uh how do you say her last name zing zing zingano and um and she beat  you you did do some homework yeah yeah yeah i remember the fight but uh you were going so it was supposed 
[01:09:00]  to be the winner of youtube fights rhonda for the championship right and i guess it means you  coach the house and then fight um but what happened with her she's injured now yeah she like blew her  knee out jumping over hurdles or something wow were you were you happy to hear that not that you wanted  to get hurt but like well how do you what do you just get the call and go look she's hurt actually you  know what dana flew me all the way to vegas to tell me he called me up was like i need you to come to  vegas right now and i was like okay you know and i was hoping that it was going to be good because i 
[01:09:30]  was like gosh what a what a dick move that would be to call me all the way call me all the way down  there and be like you're fired you know i was like that would be so rude so i was really hoping but um  he scared me a little bit but um when he finally told me i was super super stoked now why did dana  fly i wonder why would he fly you all that way instead of just telling you on the phone did he at least  say it's good news no nothing he made me suffer on the whole plane right there like twiddling my  thumbs like oh my gosh what could it be what could it be and i get there and he sits me down and he 
[01:10:00]  made my heart about drop into my stomach he goes i want to sit you down are you allowed to cuss on  here oh we prefer if you do good because i'm just making sure right now because i got a quote dana word  for word of course he doesn't say much without yeah yeah no he's a real potty mouth yeah exactly so um he  sits me down he goes i just want to i want to sit you down i'll look at you eye to eye and tell you  how fucking serious i am and like he said it in a way that i was like oh my gosh like they're gonna 
[01:10:30]  fire me or something you know what i mean they're gonna cut me and then he goes uh so how would you  like to coach the season of the ultimate fighter and i was like what i was like are you serious like  you're not messing with me he's like nope he's like cats and gunners injured and you're in if you  want it and i was like does that mean i get to fight ronda again and he's like it sure does and i was  like yes i've been waiting you know this is my opportunity and that's the way that i felt it was  supposed to be anyways you know and i don't know don't get me started on that referee you guys well  you stopped what was it stopped at a tko in the third round you had i think won the first two rounds 
[01:11:00]  and they stopped it in the third round yeah like no i mean it would have been one thing if it was like  a slippery slope like if each round i was getting beat up worse and worse but i yeah i dominated her the  first two rounds and then she didn't want to stand with me anymore so i didn't expect her to take me  down but i should have because i about knocked her out in the first round and then uh you know  she's she's a good fighter and she's a good wrestler she wrestled in college you know on paper she's  supposed to be better than i am so she's like got very good like hips and like it was hard to get up 
[01:11:30]  and then this damn referee is like i call her like a little yippee chihuahua like you know telling me  you gotta move you gotta move and i was like why i'm like she's in my half guard like who finishes  fights in half guard you know she's like shoulder bumping me and i'm like big deal so um but the ref was  like dude you gotta you gotta get back to your feet you gotta stand up you gotta do this so i'm  like fine like so i was trying to get back to my feet and i caught the knees and you know that's  where the ref felt like it was oh man time to stop the fight but i i didn't feel that way i mean yeah  i i had people don't understand if you if you're not a fighter you know i mean it's hard to say because 
[01:12:00]  you look at it and you're like oh my god you know she's bleeding her nose is broken like stop the fight  but when you're the one in there fighting it's like no i want every opportunity to  to win you know and it doesn't matter like that's what i'm here to do like i don't care if i have a  broken nose i don't care if i'm bleeding if i'm conscious jesus i don't if i'm conscious and i'm  not dizzy i'm not stumbling and falling over and i'm i actually shot in for a takedown why are you  gonna stop the fight like let us fight it doesn't matter you know that's what we're here to do yeah 
[01:12:30]  we're you know gonna have bloody noses and stuff that's it's mma you know yeah it's not they don't give  as much uh leeway to the women that are fighting um they'll stop the fight a little sooner i think  some do yeah i think some do i think some have a harder time stomaching it and and you they feel  like more protective over it but not all of them um but she is just she's very hot and cold you know  sometimes she lets fights go way too long and then other times she stops away early she's just terrible  she's just a bad referee and i will never ever let a referee another fight of mine so could you veto a 
[01:13:00]  referee can you say i don't want this one oh yeah oh i won't do it i just will be like sorry i'm not  doing it there goes your co-main event you know i won't do it because i'm fighting in vegas again  and that's where she's based out of and i would i'm sure they'd rather just get a new ref then yeah so  you guys know in advance who's refereeing your fight uh when you get there the referee comes in  before your fight and and tells you you know and that's pisses me off too she's like if you if you're  trying i'm not going to stop the fight that you don't have to be effective you just have to show me you 
[01:13:30]  want to still fight and i was like i don't know how you didn't get that yeah yeah well you broke  your nose yeah i was still fighting you know what i mean your nose looks great thank you they know  they know how to put noses back together twice really but i've never had to have it set though  so it's just yeah right on its own i say i get hit one fight and it goes this way and then i get hit  the other one and it goes back this way so as long as i'm on my even number of fights then it'll be  straight you know some odd number it might be crooked it's always hard to say because 
[01:14:00]  fighters never think fights should be stopped they they nearly frank mir just fought and got  he took josh barnett i think he took a knee or something to the head and collapsed on the floor  and then he gets up a second later and if you watch it you're like oh he's fine but then there was that  one second where he goes down and his arms kind of go limp and you're like if they didn't stop it the  other guy wasn't exactly going to stand up and watch and we can't even wrap our heads around that  where these guys will not stop themselves even they just want to continue it that just amazes me 
[01:14:30]  yeah right yeah yeah i i just i don't know i think that the the fighters should be given every  opportunity within reason to to try to make a comeback because i've seen that before i got  dropped with a head kick when i fought julie kedsey i mean she caught me clean flashed me dropped me  actually and i armbarred her after that so i mean if the if the referee would have been like oh  stop like right away yeah i would have lost the fight but i was still like you know i mean yeah  i took a shot that's what it's about i got dropped to the ground she came in to try to finish me and i 
[01:15:00]  armbarred her and i won the fight and i was like you know give us that opportunity to to try and finish  the fight you know what i mean so we're talking to misha tate uh does it ever hurt in there we ask  all you guys that no the only time i've ever had anything hurt was i got hit in the ear once and that  hurt that's it the ear yeah that doesn't seem like i think someone else said that on our show  they're sensitive yeah doesn't we ever have something like when it's like cold and like  they flick your ear yeah yeah i mean it's kind of like that it's like when you get punched in the 
[01:15:30]  ear that's what it feels like it's really weird but yeah an ear shot none of that other stuff that  yeah watch that's something you really want to get go for the ears come on guys don't do that  why don't they aim for the ears like that's the first thing i do is try to punch in the ear  you know like sometimes when you're on the ground you'll see fighters open hand slap the ears oh  yeah that's gotta hurt yeah that hurts that's an effort to like break your eardrum because you cup  it oh yeah yeah yeah and the suction breaks your ear breaks oh man wow and that has to be painful 
[01:16:00]  that reminds me of um what the hell is that fight club well it makes your equilibrium  in the ear out front of the bar right right all right punch me he goes ah you'll punch me in the  ear it hurts and the foot stomp which you're no longer really allowed to do no you are yeah a lot  of the guys complain about that too they say that's a nightmare take a foot stomp shins really kind of  you know shins gotta hurt some of those kicks i see to the shins oh it's like all you guys ever see  i don't remember who it was but there's this disgusting video where a guy goes to kick and he's got 
[01:16:30]  like already like breadstick legs anyways it's like i don't know why you're trying to kick anybody  with those things but he kicked and the guy checked it and it broke the guy's shin in half and like  wrapped his foot around the guy for a second yeah yeah like a rubber so disgusting those are just so  like visceral you watch that and you just you feel it yeah yeah oh yeah we bang our shins on a coffee  table i know we can turn it to big these guys take full shots to the shins during a fight i just 
[01:17:00]  don't get it i i'm amazed by you guys i really am just amazed that you could take that punishment  yeah yeah man like it right that's the weird part  so what do you do what do you do like um to  just separate yourself from the the the fighter and be just you know a lady or do you jimmy not you 
[01:17:30]  you know it's that there's no separation really it's just uh me you know just a balance it'd be  like saying you know how do you separate yourself from your job when you go home and you just become  a dad or a husband or whatever you know i mean it's just part of my life i go to the gym i work out  a train i come home and i'm me i cook and bake and i'll you know a girl outside of of that but  it seems like an odd mixture to some people but i i think for me it's just you know i'm i'm just a  very competitive person but i'm proud to be a woman you know i'm not i don't want to 
[01:18:00]  i don't have penis envy or anything like that you know so you don't get annoyed when you have to like  dress up for something really you know sometimes i do when i have to like do my makeup for like these  media days like this morning i was complaining about i'm like oh i have to do my makeup again you  know i was like but um other than that no we normally like the gals to come in in a prom dress  that's that's that's how we like a gal getting of course that would be annoying guys can just roll  out of bed yeah they can they can just roll out of bed yeah that is true i mean there's different 
[01:18:30]  expectations on you know women when they yeah so uh ronda you said was a real bitch on the set yeah  what'd you do well uh she was just a brat like the whole time she just was very difficult and  rude and you know yeah you guys have to watch it i can't i mean it premieres tonight and the first like  week we kind of got along all right all right all right yeah and then shit hit the fan so oh cool  the second episode i think you guys yeah definitely by the second episode it's the first one you know it's 
[01:19:00]  not too much about her and i it's about the fighters getting into the house and whatnot and  then then uh shit gets real cool well she beat you i mean she arm barged you she's arm barred  everybody i guess the first round that she's yeah fought which that streak will obviously end i mean  you can't do that forever your entire professional career but what is it like going into a fight with  somebody who has beaten you in the first round already pretty much has seemed unbeatable so far  it's exciting to get that second opportunity you know not everybody gets that you know i mean so 
[01:19:30]  i'm really really lucky and i'm really looking forward to it you know i want i wanted to fight  her again since the that very moment you know so i feel like i learned a lot and like you said you  know she's she's only human she can only do that for so long and i really think that i've got her  figured out this time so i'm excited to give it a whirl all right well it starts tonight uh and it's  on you said uh and they're promoting by the way ufc 168 which is saturday december oh wow you that's the uh  this silva um weidman too right yeah so they're rematching and we're rematching so it's going to 
[01:20:00]  be an epic night of rematches that's an amazing uh amazing card um i guess you guys are the co-main  event yeah it's really like two main events though you know it's it's going to be awesome two title  fights two rematches two good storylines so the fans are definitely in for a treat we're going to go  out of this year with a bang that's for sure do you think weidman beats him again or do you think  that silva just was was showboating and got caught man that's so hard to say you know i think that's  what i love about mma is it's so you can never really say like it's so unpredictable and you know 
[01:20:30]  if if we were able to tell the future that i don't think it'd be as exciting what do you think i don't  know i don't know honestly i really don't um i i like both of them as fighters i think that  i i think that anderson's probably getting closer to like his way out just because he's been doing it  for so long but by no means does that think that i just count him out or don't think that he's worth it  i mean i think it's going to be an amazing fight again but hopefully he'll take it a little more  seriously and he won't you know what i mean drop his hands and do that because he got away with 
[01:21:00]  that for a long time yeah you know what i mean it's the same thing with ronda you know she's  gotten away with that and she has some bad habits from her judo and stuff but uh it only works for  so long and then you got to change it up and adapt so hopefully we'll see that yeah well it's uh okay  the 28th in uh in uh i'm guessing it's in las vegas right they're not saying where it is on this  sheet it's vegas okay at the december 28th mandalay or the mgm um i think it's at the mgm  i don't know why i mean why do i need specifics you could just go online and buy  when i think people are driving to the casino to buy the tickets physically 
[01:21:30]  you know is it 74 that's a true shithead uh ufc 168 and uh you know it's misha against ronda i  really want to see that fight uh a lot because i like you very much well thank you and it's misha tate  on twitter it's m-i-e yeah s-h-a i would have i before e yeah except when you're writing receipts  there's a couple of words where e comes first i know i hate that why did they make that rule  anyways yeah i don't know just to fuck with us there's like three or four times it's i before  e except to see after c and then and then with these words oh yeah except after c yeah it's like 
[01:22:00]  what's the a e i o u sometimes why i mean who doesn't love that song and it teaches us about vowels all  right well the uh premieres tonight on uh it's fox sports one yes okay i think that's the first  year it's on fox sports one right didn't switch over from somewhere yes it was somewhere else i  don't know fox or it's fox no it was that's all we need to know today yeah i don't know why i can't

[01:27:00]  i had to do production that's when uh i got one of my many nicknames  um slappy slappy hope his nickname was slappy because he'd slap the production together so fast  and get out of there and meanwhile everything like i said was all new to me  i just loved being there i so took advantage of your enthusiasm oh because at that point i was in  the business i don't know probably 10 years right and you were you were brand spanking new 
[01:27:30]  i took advantage of your enthusiasm we both uh after the show i know we've told the story many times  iraq would would certainly agree but when we were at af uh radio guys um you had to work weekends you had to  work holidays you had to do production you had to do appearances fast forward a bunch of years we  don't have to do any of that anymore thank god but there was a time we had to do all of it and uh  you would finish with your radio show and then you had to go in the production room and and do  production which meant like voicing commercials or tagging commercials yeah and they and they and 
[01:28:00]  they wouldn't even they would just give you the script and then it was really important for you  to be creative so you had to find music and really make it  fucking work yeah yeah and when we first got to af our production piles were exactly even yeah even  like here do a couple tags for this here's a script for this and uh i slapped mine together  and they would praise anthony's work and he was so brand new to the business back then that 
[01:28:30]  i mean getting praise like that you're like oh this is fantastic i'm gonna win an award for this  my award-winning work i did win an award you did i don't remember uh one of my um sir morgan's  cove no i think it was for that head shop or something all right was it an air award no it was uh  it was a one of the sponsor awards or fucking whatever which homeless guy might have been an  air was that an award uh yeah exactly that got thrown out but uh oh i would sit there for hours on 
[01:29:00]  end dubbing over dubbing redoing the music that isn't good enough that and i go for hours and i  would go in i'm out of here i'll see you if you're done already yeah man i'll see you tomorrow  yeah yeah i'll find out the next day you were there till 10 10 oh yeah until 10 just  fucking fine-tuning your yes yes honing my craft and i remember these types of commercials  because there'd be a script right and that's it the and the production guy what was his name oh god 
[01:29:30]  damn oh it sucks we forgot his name we liked him a lot yeah had that had that voice and every day  he did yeah how do we now remember him no we remember most of the guys always the way who was the  engineer guy with the glasses oh and the drill the big guy yeah i didn't want to say that big guy  well he was a big guy yeah yeah now this is some we can have this conversation eric very good yeah  that was eric well how do we not remember the production guy he was cool to us too 
[01:30:00]  everyone was great to us yeah just about everyone but uh he would give me these scripts like this and  be like uh just do this one in kind of a california surfer dude right and then throw some music on it and  have fun with it and then he would see me and go hey uh i i got you five three five second tags  you think he could handle that one slappy so all opie would have to do is go on fox 25 tonight on  fox 25 right right and but tomorrow on fox 25 it was like a taped thing that was already there of like 
[01:30:30]  so catch this show and then he would just be like tonight on fox 25 that was his production  and i'd be sitting there until 10 30 at night over dubbing vocals and you learned though uh you  know you learned quick enough certainly did i remember like you had to have music but you're  not supposed to talk over the vocals and i would just leave me talking over vocals and they're like  and i would explain no man it's kind of different it's cool this way i'd find the music part and if 
[01:31:00]  the vocals came in too quick before i was done talking right i would have to find the perfect spot to cut  it right and then re-loop the music in seamlessly what they would just be talking over the the vocals  which is like the the commercial no-no when uh you're doing that are we playing from there  yeah you got a little more more volume over there maybe maybe let's try it over here so so embarrassing

[01:35:30]  i did a cheech and chong one yeah you did oh boy yeah  cheech dude santa dude santa dude santa dude santa dude oh what's the matter coming from santa douche  you don't like santa dude i certainly don't it was really embarrassing yeah yeah um you hear about 
[01:36:00]  the uh the guy that was fired for using the n-word at work um yeah what happened and then they went to  court to determine if um it's a truly a bad word so you got a black boss and a black uh woman who works  for the black boss and uh he threw around the n-word and uh that cost him uh 280 000 or the  company 280 000 did they fire the guy too he said it was a term of affection yeah he was trying to say 
[01:36:30]  like no black people using it with each other is a term of affection and uh you can't you know sue me  for this but i guess he wasn't using it as a term of affection but it's like i'm i have mixed feelings  on this because i hate to see people get fired but it's a white boss said nigger to it you're done  yeah so it's like it's fair to see that everyone getting the same shit in the language a manhattan  jury this is a local story oh i didn't know that well manhattan jury awarded 280 000 to a black woman 
[01:37:00]  who was repeatedly called the n-word by her boss who's also black and claimed to use the vile epithet  as an endearing term yeah that's what i do my voice was heard today brandy johnson said tuesday  after the eight-person federal jury awarded her 30 000 in punitive damages on top of the 250 000  had already uh ordered uh strive and its founder rob carmona to pay her in a discrimination case 
[01:37:30]  wow okay yeah uh carmona's voice was also heard by the jury on a damning tape recording johnson  this is this story is written really yeah it's like our copy on a damn damning tape recording okay  johnson had made of her boss chewing her out uh in march of 2012 fucking wired herself up she's yeah  she went in with a wire we had a wire i'm not saying using the term i don't i just don't say the word 
[01:38:00]  myself just once one of the best uses of that word was in 48 hours when um nick nolte yeah nick nolte  turned to eddie murphy he goes hey uh sorry about you know nigger watermelon it was so sincere  the way he said it can we hear that i haven't heard that in years so funny man i'm not saying  using the term nigger derogatory because sometimes it's good to know when to act like a nigger but 
[01:38:30]  you all act like niggers all the time carmona said oh boy that'll get you and he's saying that's  a term of affection when johnson told her boss she was offended by his language he said you could  be offended but it's true you and her act like niggers and niggers uh let their feelings rule them  he said oh man carmona didn't dispute making the comments but maintained that he was doing out uh  doling out excuse me tough love that's not like you know my yeah it's it's yeah yeah he was uh he 
[01:39:00]  testified that he was trying to tell johnson she was too emotional wrapped up in the negative aspects  of human nature oh so what a wacky word that is man yeah it's just one person uses it it's completely  different than another person using it you could use it for fun and hijinks and affection  or the epitome of hatred it's really fucked up yeah he said the word can sometimes be used to  convey love and use the example of someone saying this is my nigger yeah yeah so that means my boy 
[01:39:30]  i love him or whatever carmona said asked if he meant to indicate love when he called johnson the word  he said yes i did there's a big difference in the terms there when this is my nigger and if you say  instead of my you say mine yeah right exactly it's amazing how ugly that becomes yes i guess the  woman cried in the bathroom for 45 minutes after this tirade nice log stuck felt degraded i felt  disrespected i was embarrassed she's crying because she had one of those fucking one of those 
[01:40:00]  fucking asshole skin rippers is there anything worse than you're trying to fucking fire out of  shit and you're like do have i ever had fluid in my body it's like i'm passing a fucking a rock  through a dry vein yes and it just and then it comes out and you're like what was hurting me so much  holy shit going around the corner yes i don't you don't sit properly on the bowl oh  sometimes it feels like a fucking porcupine coming out i'm shitting a sea urchin 
[01:40:30]  yeah i don't think that one's it it wasn't a big scene like with the fight or anything it's  tough to find it was one of those where he's just i'm sorry yeah i'm just trying to  should be home giving my wife to high hard one boy he throws that word around a lot in this movie oh god  spear checker fuck yeah yeah yes mr kate that was a good fucking movie does it hold up i haven't 
[01:41:00]  seen that one in years you know what it holds up in that it's an 80s movie okay so as an 80s movie  and knowing it is it still holds up as opposed to something like cobra where you know it's an 80s  movie and it doesn't hold up it gets better it gets better because it sucks so bad right but 48 hours  was just good and it's still good uh the music oh they got the music going yeah some of the 
[01:41:30]  fucking styles in it casio shit basically yeah yeah yeah exactly and and just the way they made movies  back then but uh fuck it's so cool that bar scene is classic man yeah just here to help you officer  yeah it was a fucking great one that is a great comedy and it's before cop buddy movies yeah became  so watered down and shitty yeah like that's why lethal weapon works right because it was you know  it was believable and funny and like you know right wasn't that this adorable yeah now i can't even 
[01:42:00]  sit through you know a lot of these i can apparently mark walberg has become the guy for these police  buddy movies uh he's got another one coming out two guns yeah all right yeah yeah and i don't know  well hey sam a dude yo sam dude what nothing uh you missed sam dude sam dude  sata dude man oh it was good yeah yeah it was terrific then i used my other voice for 10 show club

[01:44:00]  different tracks in that there was the beginning one where it was mellow because i'm just doing the  list and then the middle one where it kind of starts kicking in and then the big bono and and i always  made sure i changed the music on a vocal like accent oh my god to make sure it like yeah it gave  it that oomph i picked the first one oh we would pick the first song on the this one uh is asking  for an up-tempo number so i would go into the up-tempo yeah number one and they were all these 
[01:44:30]  sideways versions of popular songs right right like you'd need some grunge thing and it would be like  this almost nirvana song done in some studio it's got all about that oh god douche chills anthony  wtf what what wtf is that i was doing my job i had to do my job they loved it the sales staff  loved anthony's production loved it exactly oh exactly oh well finance i heard really loved it 
[01:45:00]  fucking gary what are you from indiana or something oh gary indiana fuck yeah  when does the gary era officially end today when does it end the gary because i thought it ended  yesterday with the big announcement and us with the big meeting but then i heard you guys had a staff  meeting once again without the players themselves and uh and and he was running the meeting he ran the  meeting it was so weird what could he have possibly said in the meeting knowing that he's done not 
[01:45:30]  only did he run the meeting but in the beginning of the meeting they announced they were leaving  and tim sabian was coming in then tim came in and spoke and said hi to us and everything  then bladder and tim left the meeting and then gary was like okay so let's continue what is everybody  working on you don't continue at that point we were like what do you care right well you gotta  understand saving uh it needs time i think it's a transitional speed we're in a weird transitional 
[01:46:00]  phase where um yeah we're kind of in limbo here you know but gary i guess is still as of right now  the guy he's to be treated as such and respected you think he could still fire somebody  i don't think i'm gonna bite my tongue yeah could he ever fire he might of course not i was just giving  him a slight respect there of course he can't fire anyone you're just getting those digs in while 
[01:46:30]  you still can oh no just speaking openly and honestly it's true i mean it's trying to do that  here on this show it's not in his job responsibility we all knew he couldn't fire anyone even you guys  yeah you know yeah oh he would have to go through many channels he wasn't the guy that fired anyone he  started the list though what do you mean like you know when there's a file on somebody they're just  waiting for him to screw up and then there's the back catalog of uh uh discrepancies right he started  the list of discrepancies oh okay i think really he started building the case he would like a nazi 
[01:47:00]  trustee i don't know if i'll make that comparison in the pow camps like a nazi bookkeeper yeah yeah yeah  yes yes name it's ah bernstein he didn't actually have the balls to pull the trigger he's the  fucking the little guy with the ground nazi glasses and sitting at the little fallout desk right and  they would walk up ah yes name exactly and they would just fucking sarah yeah 
[01:47:30]  you could have just said like a bookkeeper no a nazi bookkeeper a nazi bookkeeper  not the guy that actually does it so he could walk away and go hey i didn't do anything but just as  responsible as the nazi as the nazi people are asking about the bus trip bus trip is not happening  i think that was the final straw here that's it there is no bus trip people we would have pulled 
[01:48:00]  it off but there was no real focus with uh the guys that were that used to don't look for the  channel don't look for the bus trip hope he just had a cheeky grin he said used to run the channel with  tim sabie and then we'll go hey tim we got this bus tour but we're really not we're really not sure  what we want to do with this and then he'll present us with probably 10 ideas that's the  difference right and then it'll be well focused and we will uh we will we will do that and then  things will get done right i want to make sure everything's straight who are you officially 
[01:48:30]  holding responsible for there not being a bus tour gary he would he never had the skill set  skill set we can only do so much could we get on a bus tomorrow and pull off uh radio shows  absolutely oh we kind of needed someone to go well i got some ideas and then you you throw the  ball around because then we're like well you know what i wasn't thinking that but now that you said  that yeah and then that's how things get done yeah i i guess that maybe this is a good move then 
[01:49:00]  it's a great move i think it's an amazing move i think if you ask gary he would probably not  take full responsibility for there not being a bus trip yeah that's too bad  i'm blaming gary for i blame him for pretty much everything apparently pop had tim sabian and i'm  stuck with you oh come on yeah mom mom knitted some wigs 
[01:49:30]  i blame gary that the keyboard is once again sitting in front of us this weird keyboard that  is no one has ever used it's a symbolic thing the keyboard is the keyboard a problem there no can  it be moved immediately yes it's symbolic of many things around here i have no doubt uh we just said  hi to tim yesterday yeah and hugged and shit that crap but one of the first things i'm going to tell  him is like look we want to spruce up the studio i guarantee you it'll take a week tops tim will come 
[01:50:00]  in and say first thing that keyboard needs to go it seems to have no place right tim will come in and  go you need another keyboard there to even the mouth one is not good two keyboards fair we had a weird  meeting i guess almost three months ago oh boy and i got really excited because we uh i thought we were  being heard we wanted a bunch of little things uh done here in the studio and i got i actually got  excited and it was young sam roberts that said to me do you really believe that things are going to get 
[01:50:30]  done this time i said yes and you pretty much laughed at me yeah and made me see it the right  way the way that you taught me opie do we have a clip do we have that clip yes we do it's from three  months ago right just about june 18th june 18th what the we're into september already okay this was this  is uh what happened in june 18th on our show it's what are you doing in his after show you're in a closet  he's in the you're in a closet before you make fun of this closet why don't we show them show them 
[01:51:00]  what a party this closet is how many people are there summer camp has moved into this production  studio holy shit yeah well what am i going to do sit there and wait for you guys to talk about stuff  that's never going to get down in that studio you should have cracked the mics on and heard the  fucking crap that goes on you guys know that console is never going to change oh uh no you  think that was a waste of meeting a total waste of your guys time you should i got tricked i got  tricked this time i got tricked too it's not gonna i got tricked i really thought we were getting things 
[01:51:30]  done no this was going to be getting cut down right i got more room that was june 18th right yeah  and here we sit with the same exact console with the keyboard still kind of just sitting there there  were two available weeks over two weeks while we were away that's usually when they get things done  done things right look i'm not the type of guy to say i told you so so i won't but i guarantee 
[01:52:00]  tim sabian will get it done immediately immediately that's that's the difference wow  good luck in financing well it's not the end yet because you're moving upstairs to where the boring  people go upstairs to where you wouldn't even know that it's an entertainment driven medium it's just  down here you kind of know you see the microphones you see the people um the studios you know you go  upstairs it could literally be an oil facility office yeah looks like morgan stanley with a guitar 
[01:52:30]  on the wall it could yes yeah yeah it could be yeah yeah they don't even have firm they don't even  have anything on the wall no no it could be a sweat factory doesn't matter this is not the boiler room to  say goodbye just yet though because we are working on a celebration oh of you know the radio wizard in  his career on the opie anthony show oh all right which we would like to invite gary to attend once

[01:54:30]  into the category never to be seen again upstairs and complete avoidance share an office with kevin  straley and wickland yeah yeah the people we never see they just throw darts at oh and a closers all  i'm sure this works both ways i know i'm not stupid oh he's just he couldn't be happier  no he'll be in that category i'm out of there finally he'll wave well we'll bump into him out of  nowhere every once in a while you think every so often like oh hey there he is right you'll say 
[01:55:00]  hey there he is hey how you been right there were good things that happened uh as far as this show  goes while he was watching over us and you know if he gets blamed for the negative i'd say he should  also be rewarded for all the positive things all right i thought you guys would name one thing he did  all right look name one thing he did we had a bang up uh show in chicago that we did our live show 
[01:55:30]  what did what did he do for that he made sure the flights you know worked out oh well  most of them did he and then he him and uh bladder stared at us as we were trying to drink a few beers  during the broadcast that was the most uncomfortable that's when the law got laid down they can no longer  fucking stand on the side of the stage judging us they were judging us with their eyes that was so  uncomfortable god i was drinking a beer behind the mic oh boy i felt like when i was i used to be 
[01:56:00]  driving and i picked up a beer to take a swig and i'd look over and a cop was next to me right same  feeling yeah don't need that we got eyeballed got eyeballed why wouldn't they want that i don't know  your way on company time why wouldn't they want you drinking alcoholically in front of an audience  getting sauced yeah why wouldn't they want you getting drunk making decisions in front of 500  people on company time the nerve of them you mean these idiots paid for everything and wanted a sober

[01:59:30]  years do you have anything yeah he gave me a raise oh so i'm almost back up to my xm wage now  but officially it was a raise yeah okay yeah all right put that on the list should we make a list sam  uh i know you like lists we make an old-fashioned list okay let's see here  what's the things did he ever bring us uh pop tarts or was that the other guy that was that was boss 
[02:00:00]  cross yeah that was ross cross cross yeah i have a new respect for boss cross that nickname was given  to him by covino and rich oh they call him boss cross ironically  probably not oh rob cross uh have been i have a new respect for that guy he put his  fucking balls on the line for troy kwan yeah big fucking time

[02:05:30]  got back from vacation last night so we we just got back to hamptons  i went totally over the dark side you did yeah you like it this was the only the second normal  vacation in like my life yeah without having to go somewhere very far away and were you getting  recognized out there i think you know the natural inclination would say you know you're on permanent  vacation motherfucker yeah true true um this is the first time that i've actually you know done the sort 
[02:06:00]  of normal month barbecue in the backyard you know super dad thing so like  i i've kind of overcompensated i become this sort of manic like manic frenetic like psychotic  you know super dad yeah yeah i've gone full ina you know you're dead you know everybody get together  well you know we're having all the greatest hits from my jersey shore you know childhood vacations you  know we're having the goddamn steamers and the lobster too you're fucking corn and i'm getting 
[02:06:30]  the tomatoes at the farm stand and you'll enjoy it and you know you get you're the nine different  choice of nine different pancakes and i'm like you know it's like way way way way way over the top  uh-huh we had uh we had similar summers sir didn't dig any holes for the kids yeah i was digging holes  every day on the beach yeah yeah every day you had to hit water with your damn hole yeah i just i  fit normal family normal family you know let's be normal and it got so crazy we were doing our  own clamming yeah did you do that uh i haven't done it that's a really good idea it's awesome when 
[02:07:00]  you feel a clam with your big toe there's nothing better well there's nothing better i can think of  a better thing to feel a clam with i'm like i'm like the most considerate driver too like in the hamptons  because you know i drive like a black foreign car every other douchebag who goes to the hamptons  for the summer drive so like i really go out of my hyper aware having worked summer jobs and and  been sort of a local uh in a vacation meeting you know you know what it's like to be a local and have 
[02:07:30]  all of these douchebags and assholes yeah yeah gamers coming into your town i'm like i really try hard  super hard to not be that guy right it's almost impossible though sometimes right it is yeah every  stoplight it's a yes yeah they're all slow and local i don't give anybody any leeway these days on a  red light if if they're in front of me at a red light or an arrow especially and i'm behind them  and they don't move the second it turns i know that they're texting or something they're not paying 
[02:08:00]  attention to the light so i'm like there it is there is green in a second do they ever catch them  looking in the mirror like oh yeah and then i'll just go go yeah for me um i don't do that because  i'm hyper aware at all times that there's generally speaking someone in the car with a  an even shorter fuse and a lower threshold of me and my wife is there oh i you know two seconds  it's i kill you with my bad hands you mother yeah you can and she can which makes it more troubling 
[02:08:30]  i met your wife yeah and um it was uh in vegas at the uh ufc she was in the back area where all  the fighters are actually and uh reed harris introduced us she was very lovely just chatted  very briefly and she could kick some ass yeah as we all know ah that's handy i guess she was there for  the fight oh you don't have to deal with that when your wife says something you got to step in and  settle the the dispute oh no no yeah no it's exactly the opposite you know good for you just 
[02:09:00]  had misha tate and she was you know she is yeah yeah sure lovely yeah she um i'm looking forward to  really good i'm looking forward to the what is it uh ultimate fighter yeah it's uh is it it's ronda  rousey and misha tate yeah yeah tonight starts tonight great yeah we'll be watching that at my house if  she stretches on the show oh my god she stretched anthony bourdain we've lost our minds she's so  fantastic holy crap yeah but i gotta say i saw the whole season of parts unknown i loved it i know 
[02:09:30]  you're here to promote uh the getaway but i loved parts unknown thanks you're going to libya the 15th  it starts again again yeah uh and the the best episode i think was quebec you're reading some weird  shit up there i like what you know one of the joys of making the show is that you know one week  it's libya uh obviously a pretty serious show right uh you know the next i'm basically just stuffing  food into my rich food into my face in in quebec you know you almost said food into my rich face 
[02:10:00]  but that was that was about as as over the top uh you know food food-centric self-indulgent show  as i've ever made what does beaver taste it was beaver right yeah surprisingly good doesn't sound  like it could possibly be good you know yeah because it's kind of rodent-y well you would  think it'd be oily and rodent-y but it's actually you know more in the i'm not going to say it's like  chicken it's always chicken i guess it uh depends on how it's prepared right uh like anything i'm sure 
[02:10:30]  there's a way to it up yeah yeah um i mean you can fuck up chicken easily you know pop it in the  microwave this year it's uh israel west bank gaza uh show uh spain a really dark really i have no  idea i don't know if the network's even seen the tokyo show but we did a very deranged uh tokyo show 
[02:11:00]  about the sort of the connection between uh sort of fetishism and repressed japanese sexuality and  porn wow so there's a lot of hentai tentacles uh bondage uh and sushi wow and sushi let's throw in  the sushi and we do the detroit show denmark that's gonna be a good one how bad is detroit these days  you know i love that look that's a city i really really love and and i you know detroiters really 
[02:11:30]  hate it when people from outside go in and say wow it's really awesome looks like ancient rome look  at these ruins taking pictures romans don't like that either but but you can't look away i mean it  really is it's it looks like chernobyl and that's not a joke it looks like i've been to chernobyl it  looks like chernobyl um overgrown you know all of these 70 000 unoccupied you know vacant buildings  uh it's just incredible structures just left to to rot you know fields you know waist high grass and 
[02:12:00]  and you know old gardens the house isn't there anymore but the gardens are now sort of growing  wild it's pretty amazing but um you know it's a tragic but awesome right place i mean if you don't  like detroit you know how you feel about detroit is one thing detroiters is another thing that's yeah  yeah that's a city with a sense of humor i guess you have to have one but yeah it's just a place  i've loved for a long time what do you do on that episode without giving it away um we're hanging out 
[02:12:30]  with a guy charlie laduff who wrote a go a former new york times reporter and now a reporter for uh  a television station in detroit and uh you know born and raised and uh wrote a great book called  detroit and american autopsy and uh so we basically hung out with you know old school detroit uh  politicians cops firemen um you know it's definitely not the new you know hipster pizzeria that you must 
[02:13:00]  know about right yeah yeah what are they gonna do to fix that place i mean there's no reason an  american city should be in that bad of shape it's gonna have to shrink i mean that's uh  what i mean what what would be nice to happen and what will probably happen are two different  things i mean what would be nice to happen is all the people who've who've hung out there and fought  it out and and survived and and held onto their homes as everybody around them you know burned down or  ran away or turned into crack houses you know it would be great if if the future of a the future 
[02:13:30]  of detroit included them i don't know that it will you know i think it'll it'll definitely shrink it's  down from over two million people to a city of 700 000 it's 134 square miles so police and fire  coverage is forget about i mean they don't have computers you know the the you know the now what  national crime control computers in uh in the police cars they use their own cell phones sometimes to  call in they take they take the bus to murder scenes it's not unheard of it's pretty ludicrous 
[02:14:00]  wow but what will happen i think it'll it'll probably be like the lower east side you know  people live in the lower east side are not the people who you know lived there who grew up there  and then who lived through all the bad times they have to re uh readjust borders and districts and  that's the biggest pain in the ass because it all comes down to who's getting the money um for uh  being within city limits you start pulling in the city limits and now that no man's land outside 
[02:14:30]  what happens to that how does that get developed yeah it's a big big question but you know what people  overlook is it is an incredible it is a beautiful city it's beautiful i mean even the buildings that are  maintained they're gorgeous and it's just about everything cool in america it's not the world came from  detroit or detroit special yeah yeah the automobile the credit card uh you know the music of detroit  it's you know it's everything american yeah yeah we can't get it right there you know we really should 
[02:15:00]  sort of fold up our tents how did it fall so far into the toilet was just the auto industry collapsing uh  the auto it it shrunk uh basically the auto certainly didn't help the audio of the auto industry started  to contract i mean so you know you went from a city of two million people down to 700 000 it started  the decline really started in the 50s oh really quite some time and there was a lot of uh you know  not just white flight but black middle class flight um but decades of really spectacular political 
[02:15:30]  corruption i don't know how many mayors in a row have been in the joint now but it's  it's quite a number of them yeah yeah um it's uh it's uh you know they've they've had more than  their share of uh of of problems did you see hope there anthony any hope at all or was it just downright  depressing for you yeah because they're they are obstinate uh they're obstinate proud funny tough as hell 
[02:16:00]  um you know at any time you you have that in a in a you know in a city's character there's gonna be  hope right um but i think you know whatever happens a lot of people who deserve better are  going to end up getting screwed i think that's that's the way it always plays out yeah yeah i mean  even on a neighborhood by neighborhood you know a basis you look at like you know the meat district or  the lower east side here hell's kitchen you know you look at the neighborhood then and who lives there now 
[02:16:30]  right you know first come the artists you know then come the boutique hotels and then you know  swarms of hipster douchebags it's different though in a small area like new york like you know because  you you can move into say the lower east side and you're still only a quick ride to chelsea or we're  at midtown like detroit being spread out that far even you know if you like gentrify one area  then the rest of it is still a shithouse yeah it's really hard it seems like something that big to 
[02:17:00]  because hipsters do in a weird way save certain places colin quinn pointed that out to me too  they're ballsy like as much as it's fun to trash them and i do they move into fucking bedford stuyveson  then these fucking white guys with bell bottoms and fucking beetle hairdos taking the subway to bed  stye at two in the morning there's a certain balls to that which the man is right and yeah they're  already there like you know artists uh urban farmers a lot of people making use of the lot that you  know there's a lot of dead space there that people are growing stuff and producing you know 
[02:17:30]  local vegetables and produce for underserved areas look there's no doubt about it hipsters will you  know if to the extent that these places are going to get saved it's yes it's going to be somebody with  an ironic beard and uh a pack of american spirits in the front pocket  nice what's uh yeah what's this now the getaway you're working on uh well the getaway is what for 
[02:18:00]  esquire channel and um it's basically you know i used to do a show called the layover where i'd go and  do get a 24 48 hours in a in a city um my partners and i started thinking well this would be actually  a much better concept if we got people who were actually had some connection to these places and  knew what to do in those places were you know uh so we are basically grabbing people who've accomplished  things in their lives who are funny you've got something going on who have a particular connection 
[02:18:30]  with a place um and would you know are good at would be the right person to drop into these locations  and we sent them off and let them loose so we have um joel mikhail we sent to ireland to uh  oh wow yeah um and uh aisha tyler to paris and uh let's see who else is on the show aziz ansari  um so we sort of tried to you know look for interesting people with interest who've done  interesting things with interesting things to say and send them someplace you know really cool that 
[02:19:00]  they felt really strong about strongly about or had roots there but they had not necessarily gone  there in the past uh if it's a situation in almost every case they've been there before or it's a  place they were just dying to go to right it was a you know sort of a personal obsession yeah there's  always a connection are you on the show too or is or are you just producing it gotcha very cool oh nice  look at that producer had to slap that credit on the screen and send me the check 
[02:19:30]  yeah yeah yeah yeah that's it also doing another season of mind of a chef uh that's for pbs  producing that as well uh this year it's sean brock and april bloomfield uh last season it was david  chang and um speaking of uh korean dudes named david i saw your podcast with uh david my friend david  david show yeah yeah has he been on the show no no i'd love to have him be fun yeah he's a really  cool guy what's he about i don't even know him he's uh he's he's most known for his facebook his 
[02:20:00]  genius face he's the highest paid artist in history because he did facebook's uh wall for stock or  whatever okay and when it translated it when it when it would have cashed in it was like over 200 million  like it's that's that's a nice yeah basically he was showing i think in like you know beauty parlors and  uh you know shoe stores in the neighborhood i mean he was a successful graffiti artist street artist  and very successful degenerate gambler oh uh but i mean i think he they asked him if he'd do some  artwork for facebook and he said yeah 50 grand and they said how we're a we're a little startup we 
[02:20:30]  can't afford that kind of money how about we pay you in stock and i think he cashed out it's you know  north of 200 million yeah i would i would paint my face with tommy morrison's dick  now he wasn't the guy that was featured in um yeah koreantown yeah yeah oh okay i do know him  he's a his podcast was he the guy that painted your avatar for us okay yeah great artist great guy uh 
[02:21:00]  he was he's a cool dude man yeah he did patrice's cover he just did uh yeah oh my god of course i know  this guy and that was another great episode really great looking into koreantown out there in la and what  they've been through holy crap i had no idea very bright very funny very tortured uh brilliant guy  you know the girl he does the pot i'm sorry oh she's an ex-porn girl and i know she's still active  she is funny and sexy man she's great nice i'm gonna have to check that out yeah it's really it's  good and he doesn't need the money he just loves doing it yeah you talk about gambler that that right 
[02:21:30]  there is like i'll gamble and take a little stock instead of money and that's like the hit of a  a lifetime well he's he's post gambling rehab but i mean he's a guy he's he'd bet like 50 grand on on  the coin toss oh boy 50 grand on what color of uh of gatorades coming out of the you know they're  pouring on the coach yeah yeah not oh yeah not a healthy gambler no no but he probably has a great  story and when you got that much money it's like you're lucky you got it out of your system before 
[02:22:00]  you blew through everything but i mean i just saw him uh a few weeks ago he he he hitchhiked across america  with his uh with his buddy uh shooting it with a you know little little handicap um he he rides  trains you know like hobo style right right wow um he vacations in places like afghanistan and the  congo he's not your usual rich guy by a long shot he just went to mexico right after we did the podcast  he went down there for it's kind of crazy to show some yeah man it's like you got to enjoy your money 
[02:22:30]  and not change who you are but you got to be careful too there's a certain line you got to draw like  all right there's a real boy would a kidnapper love to get their hands on him down there in  mexico i bet i am hopefully he's back now but yeah he's back he had a big uh exhibit down there but  great great guy he'd be great great on the show yeah we talked about fucking perversion for quite a  while yeah have you been to uh mexico in a while not you jimmy uh hoping to uh this coming season uh not  the one that's going to be airing but i mean i start filming again in yeah november oh i'm hoping 
[02:23:00]  to do a mexico show um any concerns um whether these bloggers that apparently had photo sort of  amateur photo journalists who go to crime scenes they basically are documenting all of the thousands  and thousands and thousands uh more more i think something like 60 000 people have been killed  in just the last few years wow uh they document the crime scene so we might do that you know mix it 
[02:23:30]  up sort of fun mexico and then dark side you're crazy to go down there man even for all the places  that's oh come on the fuck the cartels is just this scary man you gotta love that place though you  got all of it i mean my whole crew are so so happy there i mean yeah of all of the places that we  shoot we it's one of the few places where we'll shoot a scene of me shoving food in my face end the  scene and then we'll all go and eat just all stand there in the street eating you know sort of some 
[02:24:00]  grandmother you know making tacos or tortillas it's you know it's just a great drinking culture great  eating culture the music is amazing it's just really you know particularly because  well like detroit they're they're a culture that have been just so relentlessly fucked over the  years yeah that that they've had to develop a really brilliant sense of of of humor and melodrama  and uh it's just a place that i really really really love yeah i went to cancun a couple years ago 
[02:24:30]  and i did okay with the water and the night before i just finally i shot two pilots for mtv neither took off  and um i was i had to shoot the next morning and i drank our cappuccino the night before not  realizing that was made with local water so i'm surrounded by teenagers in 110 degree heat with  lights on a beach and i had to keep running and shitting oh it was horrendous horrendous you were  percolating yeah you sort of have to plan around the shitting like a mink you know yeah why don't 
[02:25:00]  the locals uh they do they do well i mean um that has it it's horrifying that i know this but  actually a lot more frequently they do and have lower incidence of rectal cancer i don't know why  i know that but is that because of that you think apparently there's a connection between frequent  shitting also squat cultures lower incidence of rectal cancer well you where you squat rather than you know 
[02:25:30]  ride the bowl well you know when i when i shit uh this had to come up at one point i i there's a  i have a thing that i prop my feet up on because supposedly my knees are actually raised when i  shit i sit and my knee yeah mirror in front of the video camera it's my new website um he's got a  little stool for his feet there anthony i i do i prop my feet up i got it from a health place um amazing  and so my feet are always kind of propped up in the squat thing which is better for you it's it's  it's better for your system well look if anyone would like to you know i i don't i don't generally 
[02:26:00]  do product endorsements or anything like that but i would really like a japanese toilet you know one of  those deluxe japanese toilets with the alternating spray that moves back yes various temperatures you  know it ionizes the air makes covering sounds of tropical rainforest to cover the sound of your groaning  and spraying it's spraying cleans itself you know just a the gentle warm pulsing of water you know 
[02:26:30]  back and forth heated air conditioned region uh everyone on my show are upset we it's like we  we all look forward to japan and everybody shows up on set late they're all like they'll come out  with this blissed outlook like oh sorry man having the best dump ever again that japanese culture there's  something about the um yeah the nether regions that they just really are very attentive to  they're very focused on oh boy holes yeah they ever yeah that is a also you know it's not just 
[02:27:00]  well the tight focus is is a sort of uh a sort of a signature of of uh you know japanese fetish they  have those clubs where you go with like uh with a what do you call it a magnifying glass you sit there  you see these like salary dudes sitting there with a magnifying no way like a robot not really a strip  club was sort of like robot cabaret which was like the most insane it's on the show uh oh really  basically a big sort of sexy cabaret with battling robots and dinosaurs and like pandas it's break 
[02:27:30]  dancing break dancing robots they're on the molly's the best thing ever yeah they gotta be on the molly's  over there it's the best where does that come from have you figured it out yet no but i really  because they're not really doing anything different than other people as far as uh drinking and drugging  well they don't really have a lot of drugs there there's some but but when you hear these stories  you would think there would be a lot of drugs involved they're super savage drinkers they're  terrible they're like the worst drinkers in the world i mean by by they're done by like 7 30 and you 
[02:28:00]  got in like uh shibuya district in tokyo and it's like all these young guys already on their hands and  knees you know puking into the gutter while they're they're hot completely sober girlfriends are like  you know holding their hair back and they just put up with this nonsense they they they're terrible  terrible terrible binge drinkers they make the brits look look like good and it's all sake or what  well beer a lot of beer whiskey there's a big wine culture as well it is people really do like to 
[02:28:30]  they don't get a lot of opportunity to behave irresponsibly when they get that window of  opportunity they really yeah yeah drink all night and then go show up and go right to work the next  day is not an unusual thing it's also the bonding thing the boss everybody will sit around at work  salary men will sit around at work waiting for the boss to go home you don't want to go home before  the boss the boss is not going home because he's his boss hasn't gone home yet they just sit around  jack it off looking at the looking out the window till till midnight and then it's like oh well 
[02:29:00]  let's go out you know company spirit get completely hammered you spending thousands of dollars on  cocktails too because along with it you go to like these hostess bars where basically you're spending  thousands of dollars for for someone to say oh you know your life is really interesting what do you  do i work for a widget company oh that's so fascinating you're very you're the most interesting  producer of widgets i've ever met and what a fascinating business and you're so funny and  delightful and let's you know let's play you know you don't get even laid for this this money you're 
[02:29:30]  just uh it's that's very much the culture so you takes your pleasure where you can wow it is  crowded you know you live with your parents so you're right often you're living with your parents  until until you're 30. you know how much room there could be talking to me that's when i moved  out when i was 30. how humiliating i moved back in at 29 myself for a little while at least you were  out for a while yeah i was out 18 to 29. more than some need a little help in between radio jobs 
[02:30:00]  uh magnifying glasses yeah that's a little you know you've heard i've we i thought i've heard it  all but not that one the dirty underwear vending machine yeah yeah yeah but a magnifying glass  frotage is big you know what's that oh frog rope frotage yeah groping and on the subways and stuff  i always thought it was called frottage i frotage i did that in high school in high school i did  this i called it grazing where i would try to get i would literally in my mind go back and just jerk  off remembering what i did and i would get like a double cheeker double cheech with the crack i did it to 
[02:30:30]  a fucking gym teacher once in the pool where i was walking by and she was standing there in a  fucking bikini and her ass was amazing and i'm like i have to do it and i allowed my hand to  graze over both of her cheeks and i just kept i felt her turn around oh she knew it was just me and  her i was standing outside the pool there's plenty of room in the pool dude no we were walking by she  was standing outside the pool okay and i allowed it and i knew if i turned around i knew if i turned  around i knew if i turned around i was dead if i acknowledged her i was dead but she stared at 
[02:31:00]  me and the fact that i just kept walking gave me the ounce of plausible deniability right and then  there's a substitute gym teacher whose ass i grabbed one time in a crowd what's the statute of  limitation on the sexual assault by the way if you're listening i just grabbed it and like in  in a you know a crowded uh hallway where i just grabbed her ass well that's some shameful shameful  sick sick sick that is like twisted stuff that's just normal i wasn't getting laid i was like you 
[02:31:30]  15 i just would jerk off thinking about asses going out rubbing your hand on strangers on  strangers and then heinies beating off to it with to the thought of it later they actually have a little  for that in it's a it's a reproduction of a subway train and you go in and you people pretending to be  other passengers are there to be willingly that they pretend that they don't know what's going on  and you can go in and sort of rub up against them but if you're going in knowing everyone's 
[02:32:00]  pretending yeah it's no fun you're still getting off a little bit if that's your thing yeah we  didn't fully investigate this subject but we got into uh shibaru i think it's called it's a japanese  rote bondage uh which is very big hentai which is uh interesting and what's called otaku culture  which is basically nerd or geek culture people who spent pretty much their whole lives living you  know expressing themselves through anime characters or what are called vocaloids who are sort of um 
[02:32:30]  holographic characters who actually give concerts and sing you can go see them uh so you could  theoretically you could have you know a virtual girlfriend hologram like an archer you know a  hologram girlfriend that would be so they're extremely creative they have whole districts of toys and  and fantasy characters and uh right i don't know it's got to come from uh such a powerful uh  uh traditional culture that was just decimated during a war i don't know let's all pretend we're 
[02:33:00]  an octopus with eight vaginas and a hat it's really weird though like i was thinking if i got we we  interviewed the guy who basically invented uh tentacle porn and uh he gave me this really fantastic  t-shirt and i was thinking of bringing it in for you guys and then i thought they can't put that  anywhere in america you can't put that up on a wall you'll get sued it's too horrendous over there  i'm interviewing this guy about the history of tentacle porn and his work and it's a we're we're  at a very sort of traditional japanese restaurant uh like a shabu shabu place with a little burner in 
[02:33:30]  the center of the table we're having beers and eating and the proprietors of these older japanese  women in a 70 80 you know very conservative dress and here his this guy has his work spread out  across the table and it is it's just mind-blowingly obscene yeah and not a blink this oh that's very  interesting that's very very good work oh please tell me more about your you know what what what's  the octopus doing there and what's his name just not a blink just totally very so a lot of ways they're 
[02:34:00]  a lot less fucked up about sex than we are are we gonna learn where that came from  if we watch the show where tentacle porn came from yes okay good yes i am curious because i find it to  be very silly like all that stuff like anything that's sexual like when they have and i hate anime  some of that anime stuff's not bad i just don't like the you know oh with the teardrop shooting off and  with their giant eyes really and there's six cocks and they have hooks in them and 
[02:34:30]  fucking what are you doing just wish your dick was bigger like the rest of us you don't have to  fucking paint it like that obscene i don't get it okay you can't show dicks in japanese porn yeah  yeah they care right right so tentacles they could show if that makes you know what anthony just made  sense that's exactly getting to the answer already but just show the dicks then and the friggin pubes 
[02:35:00]  what's the biggie about that different different standards and practices can't show pubes it's so  silly octopus that's or an alien with a tentacle like protuberance right right acceptable that's  their way of saying mother effer on the regular radio they're kind of getting it past the sensors  but exactly yeah yeah all right that makes a little bit of sense so that the repressed culture does kind  of cause that because of course you know where it came from yeah that makes less that makes a lot  more sense it's not as crazy as i thought no of course not but i don't like this stuff it's so odd 
[02:35:30]  you're loving cnn i'm loving it they've been so good to me i mean they've never blinked as far as  content as far as what what i'm where i'm going and you know we've asked to go to some pretty  upsetting places that no one network of their right mind would have would have said you know congo  you know the drc you know they didn't blink they were like oh yeah we know people there we can help you  that's it too that's a great a great uh organization to be with because they have those uh  contacts and fixers they have they yeah they have the ability to um you know use credentials and 
[02:36:00]  whatnot to get into some of these places you know a good fixer will save your life frequently in a  place like congo and a bad one will really get you in the shit really um you know just a little  the local contracts as far as content what i say how i say it uh what what how the show is going to  look you know not a blink they've been totally appreciative and supportive of everything i've  done um that's great they've they've been great i mean i haven't had a single stupid conversation 
[02:36:30]  with an executive at uh oh my god at cnn it's an extraordinary what's that like sir wow  smart people we've only had stupid conversations with executives here smart smart people who've uh  not only supported me but also if they in every instance since the first conversation before i  even signed up with them uh if someone at cnn said to me this this is going to happen and this is what  we're going to do if you do that it happens oh my god i know it's incredible this is amazing 
[02:37:00]  that's a strange place yeah it's an odd magical place magical it really is  you know the music the the storytelling style the language the content uh you know it's a big change  for them and it took a lot of balls for them to sort of stand up and stand next stand by me and  and they've been really really great did you hear the story about the woman too speaking of fixers  who went she was a canadian girl and she just was one of these idealistic girls who thinks oh the  world is good and she wanted to be a journalist and so she went to somalia and um and of course her 
[02:37:30]  and her idealistic friend are fucking kidnapped by islamic jihadists and they held for she's you  know she had a baby it's just a nightmare how far outside of the checkpoint were they when they got  taken i mean it might have been 50 or 100 feet they'd go oh man past the checkpoint it was like  literally because their fixers wouldn't go and they're like okay we'll just drive and then they  they were surrounded by you know they certainly wouldn't go yeah the fixer said you have to go  now that was the you know look yeah that's a big mistake if your fixer says that i'm not doing that 
[02:38:00]  that's a you know they know it's it's it's the same as like when we first arrived in vietnam years ago  um me and my my now partners at 0.0 we're in the car we're headed off to the hotel and our fixer driver  is just rambling on oh welcome to now triangle this restaurant over here is fantastic great  seafood that place over there very good pork very good pork you should eat there it's superb  next place he passed oh that place very good and you know my friend says oh how's the food at my 
[02:38:30]  hotel where we're going oh uh it's a it's okay that's like warning flashing warning sign which which  my guy just drove right through you know basically so yeah he had some crab soup there the next day  at the hotel and you know i've never seen anyone so sick i mean oh he was like projectile vomiting  for like three days turned blue lost like 30 pounds i mean lost his ability he was sick for like six 
[02:39:00]  months he was really really messed up what was it that he had did he get uh what exactly did he get for  some kind of crap or something parasitical something bad but but you know look when you're  when your fixer says i'm not so sure that's you know stop it no don't eat there what do you know  about uh syria have you ever been haven't been uh would like to go um it's a really messed up 
[02:39:30]  situation and far more complex than than anybody's really talking about um  look i like the idea of doing something as supremely uh if we bomb syria right it's completely  against our national interest to do that it was really not in our national interest to help out  in libya either that said i'm really glad we helped out in libya that was a cool thing for us to do you  you know wow we're actually helping people who deserve to be helped um we're actually do something 
[02:40:00]  for freedom not for whatever oil or whatever i think i think it's a mess i don't know that it's  going to make anything better but i i kind of like that we're at least talking about it i don't know how  it's going to turn out what is clear for sure is assad and his dad were two of the most reprehensible  figures in the middle east i would love to see them go i'm all for change like i don't know whether  that the government i doubt very much the government in egypt is you know is better for 
[02:40:30]  america than what we had before or that what the government we get in that they get in libya is  going to be friendlier to america than the one before or or syria for that matter but the fact  that at least change is possible as something that is com was completely unthinkable not before the  arabs ran everybody in the middle east thought we're stuck with these assholes forever forever  this is the way it's always going to be so blood and chaos for a while you know i don't know i mean 
[02:41:00]  i was a very opposed to the iraq war that is a disaster clearly it's that didn't work out  afghanistan hasn't worked out i'm not saying any of this will work out um but i sure as hell wouldn't  be unhappy to see assad go doesn't it just suck when we help people and then they wound up hating  our guts anyway that's the frustrating part is that there's not an ounce of gratitude  fucking five years later we're the enemy and we're shit all along that's my only objection  but it's always the way i mean do you think the french particularly love you know do they love us  or no but they don't bomb our airlines i mean well what i like about anthony bourdain and your show is 
[02:41:30]  like you really get to you know learn about the people you know the episode you did in libya you're  like holy fuck these people are pretty much like us well just want to live and have a good time people  over there like any place else there's also a lot of bad people who would like to do his harm  there are a lot of good people who for various reasons don't like us at all and would in no way  be inclined to vote for anything that that's good for us yeah but they're people you know they love  their kids they they they want to better lives for themselves they'd like to watch mtv they you know 
[02:42:00]  they like to like good food they like getting fucked up they're not going to be calling us and saying  thank you anytime soon that's for sure it's very complex situation you've got um you know these  militia groups who are made up of what you know people are for lack of any smarter way to describe  them moderates or you know what we would call reasonable or you know don't actively hate us  uh a bunch of al-qaeda dudes uh up against a repressive government that are using you know 
[02:42:30]  you know chemical weapons on their own people who are also and and hezbollah so basically you've got  like al-qaeda associated people up against hezbollah you know pick a team there yeah yeah  hezbollah they don't attack us hezbollah is shitty but israel fucking hates it killed killed over 300  u.s marines back in beirut back in the day uh you know uh tortured to death a uh uh the cia station 
[02:43:00]  chief i mean i'm talking about you you're correct but i mean like here that we they're not the threat  to me in america hezbollah i don't worry i worry about al-qaeda more between those two groups i  worry about al-qaeda more you look again it's a you know tough tough big and of course toss a coin  i've met you i mean there's no doubt in my mind we could all be having dinner with with some hezbollah  folks uh and have a perfectly great time we they would say some things that would be alarming to us  while feeding us and being you know we had to deal with them in in beirut you know yeah american how are 
[02:43:30]  you you know what you're doing in my neighborhood you know oh really yeah rolls up in the roll up in  the mercedes you know gold watch i can't wait they're not stupid people they're very they're  very sophisticated um how did you talk to what you're telling you to do we were we were shooting  in their neighborhood so within seconds of arriving the you know hezbollah showed up and said what are you  doing in our neighborhood and we're making a travel and food show and so we just shot with  in order to get into gaza for this uh uh for this latest show uh you know hamas had to give us uh 
[02:44:00]  permission so you know it's something you're crazy wait how did you get the permission that's amazing  like so whether when you said we're shooting a food show how did has blood respond travel and food show  at one point we had everything set a lot of what what is allowed to go in into gaza is extremely  restricted food building materials books basic basic stuff they're basically on 
[02:44:30]  they're being rationed and restrained you can they can't fish more than three miles off their coast  uh getting back getting over the israeli border that that ain't really happening however for a while  you could if you wanted kentucky fried chicken in uh in gaza city you could order out and people  would run through these tunnels they use to smuggle arms and other contraband in egypt get  you your kentucky fried chicken and bring it back through the tunnels so we had this whole scene  set up with hamas where we were going to go down with cameras they were going to let us go down 
[02:45:00]  into the tunnels and follow our delivery guy over to egypt to grab us our bucket of chicken  wow come back in and we spent a lot of time sitting out there by the tunnels and in the end it was  you know they got paranoid about i don't know what happened um but you know what what's particularly  in the arab world i think what what i find again and again again and people who have no particular  reason to love or like me who would on any other day of the week have no problem killing me in fact 
[02:45:30]  situations change if you are however if you wash up at their house and you're hungry almost across the  board you will be treated with and with hospitality and by hospitality i mean your host will sit right  next to you pat anyone then he making sure you're happy checking on you throughout the meal  ripping off the best parts of the lamb making sure you're eating well again and again again  when we're shooting those scenes our host um will be absolutely miserable that the camera people  aren't eating they're just tortured they're talking to me doing this thing they say look you're 
[02:46:00]  shaming me is there something can't i feed these i don't turn right towards the camera blowing the  scenes can't i feed you can't i give these guys some food you know it's disgracing me i mean i said that  i'm i'm a bad host i'm and you know please enjoy have some fun i can't wait by the way till i can  bathe in the blood of my enemies there you go that's the guy it's one of those maddening  incongruities of of travel when people who you know on any other day would or in different 
[02:46:30]  circumstances would happily do bad things to you and yours are you know lovely to you in person i guess  it helps that that's a great perspective to have though because i've never traveled and seen people  as individuals like that it's like you know you you see what you see but i guess it's it's a lot  different when you're sitting there with somebody and you know regardless of what else they do they  are people and they do know how to host a party or they do know how to have a guest over and it's  like i guess it's harder to just lump them in when you always you're not going to end up you know 
[02:47:00]  hugging it out and singing kumbaya and uh and figuring out you know hey thanks to the lamb you know i guess  world peace is possible it ain't that simple yeah but you do see glimpses of i don't know  something you know that that you know we're not all these you know faceless statistics it's one of  the best parts of parts unknown it's it's i i'm a huge fan of the show i can't wait for the next season  and it's right around the corner so head and then uh the getaway of course hezbollah lets you in when 
[02:47:30]  you said what you were there for that's fascinating to me as for hezbollah yeah they're really look they have  a gift shop okay they're very very very slick about their uh about their public image about uh  about a lot of things you know they're not they're not stupid they you know they're arguably evil  um and they're arguably terrorists um but they're not stupid people and they will take advantage and  this is something i guess we're gonna have to think about in in syria and everything we do 
[02:48:00]  that you know when you when the israelis bombed when i was in in uh in lebanon in 2006 when the  israelis would bomb uh what were referred to as hezbollah neighborhoods or shia neighborhoods where  hezbollah were influential and prevalent prevalent and present hezbollah with iranian money would show  up the next day and go from house down so you lost your house that's really terrible here's thirteen  thousand dollars to rebuild your home and by the way if we can look after your kids please stop by 
[02:48:30]  our hezbollah daycare center and you know our neighborhood watch will be looking so they step  in very shrewdly to these vacuums created by whatever world events you know whether or not  it was a good idea to bomb the neighbor in the first place let other smarter people argue over that  what i'm saying is they're really shrewd about winning hearts and minds by taking advantage of whatever  happens like kamas did that right isn't that how they kind of got in power they built schools and  did all this stuff and and people just like them well also anybody who stands up against a perceived 
[02:49:00]  enemy in whatever way is going to get some kind of you know he may be a bastard but he's our bastard  you know that kind of uh that kind of a thing it's look it's the middle east and israel west bank gaza  you know i went in stupid and i came out stupid i'm not coming out of there like a  freaking middle east expert by a mile you know i i i wish i could say i came out of there any  smarter but but um but you see a lot of stuff yeah a lot of ways you get more you get more 
[02:49:30]  data you get more confused you have more stuff to think about but you know the show's not about  what i think it's really show you what i saw and you make up your own mind right yeah that's  it's really interesting absolutely really really interesting perspective another great appearance  from anthony bourdain thank you guys yeah thank you and i understand by the way though the horrible  people like like for instance the opian anthony show are hated by a lot of radio shows like you 
[02:50:00]  guys are seen as fucking monsters yes and you're just my friends i know isn't that odd but it's really  weird to go to places and hear the perspective now this may not be the example of hezbollah  that's pretty close in spite of whatever says here you are sharing your cronuts your cronuts  the stupid cronut did you did you try one yes are they that amazing come on uh they're pretty amazing  but the dk a the the other pastry there is actually in my opinion better and you can get as many of 
[02:50:30]  those as you want no problem that's a great pastry shop and the cronut is awesome do you hate that guy  though for the way he keeps fucking holding on the cronuts i have a hatred for him i probably i  like that you can't jump the line i think it's pretty cool what was her name uh emily roberts  right to jump the line at the you know he said no no back of the line i like that who is she yeah  i've got me i don't know someone famous oh okay someone famous i guess yeah but she was trying to  yeah get the waiting on lines starting at what five six in the morning that's that's dumb look i don't  blame him it's not his fault i mean it's you know if somebody wants to wait four hours in the 
[02:51:00]  roaring sun for for two you're only allowed two or or uh trade sex you know offer to trade sex  for a cronut online which people are doing oh my god you're bidding like 500 bucks on on craigslist  for cronuts look that's a dysfunction uh you know yeah consumer the guys he's just he's a  very nice guy making a very good product he could only do 500 of them a day in a small it's a small  pastry shop he could only reasonably produce a certain amount um he's not forcing you to act 
[02:51:30]  completely silly very true imagine that though you for order sex and a girl comes over and blows you  and then you're like oh i thought you said donuts oh my fault my bad and this i thought it was a typo  hit the bricks it's good good good shop though i think it's called the dka um  though is is that's the we've tried we're not on his radar we've tried to get the cronuts we got to 
[02:52:00]  wait like everyone else yeah everybody yeah i mean al roker's hanging around out front oh the dumpster  you know he's like yeah all right is he allowed to eat cronuts by the way do you think al roker  probably not stomach steak i'm sure he's doing eating cronuts i think he did one of those i'm  sure he's cheating where he was yeah i'm sure he's getting a cronut in him every once in a while  yeah i hope so all right so it's the getaway take a trip around the globe with all these uh  famous people that's on the esquire network right yes and that starts uh wednesday september 25th at 
[02:52:30]  nine and then of course uh parts unknown season uh two that would be season two yes season two okay  wait a minute parts unknown or is it three season three it's it's three right it's season three  yeah season three starts september 15th at 9 p.m on cnn mind of a chef i don't know exactly when it  starts airing but it's coming real soon and it's real good just follow bourdain on twitter to you  know see what he's up to thank you guys always fun all right the op and anthony show on sirius xm

[02:57:30]  he has nothing to do with us nobody in finance listens to us no for old time's sake can we just  beat him up every once in a while i don't think we could stop you if we wanted to that's not gonna  feel the same though it won't no and uh the breaking news was that tim sabian's gonna be running the  channel and doing some other things here at sirius xm after his hiatus he was gone for a while  he took a little time off too we're trying jim he's not answering the phone whoa whoa okay  eric where's that coming from right that's coming from a place of hate sir right being cross wow eric 
[02:58:00]  trying i can't get him on the phone what do you think of the what do you think of uh the changes  around here eric we haven't gotten your opinion i think it's a step in the right direction whoa  wow that's a little controversial and it sure is what are you saying with that  you know he's voicing his displeasure with former management right still current because 
[02:58:30]  we're in transitional period future former management yeah yeah yeah  oh with the old in with the new wow wow this isn't a uh meet the new boss same as the old boss  situation by the way no there's no down my mind things will get better immediately all right well  we'll be marking this show for drops okay fair enough with that why don't we say goodbye to uh  the radio wizard yeah let's do it the opening anthony way yeah he's a radio wizard 
[02:59:00]  when he sat down with me and steve blatter said here's the radio wizard he's gonna get you to  radio wizard are you a radio guy yes i'm already all right so help us figure it out what do you know  what do you mean what do i know  so i was right we could blame the radio wizard because if the guy is the the guy that's overseeing  everything nothing gets done obvious things that need to get done yeah you gotta blame him 
[02:59:30]  gary made uh the staff pay for their sandwiches yesterday  gary what are you doing gary how how much could a sandwich be it was seven bucks 13 bucks so why  wouldn't the company just pick up the lunch everybody's getting reimbursed 
[03:00:00]  oh by the way we should have talked about buffing the head because uh the radio wizard just walked  by he's a buffer people start writing chrome dome the only person that got his passport was the guy who  was there to remind everybody to remember their passport right i got to give kenny credit i was  looking through his list of getting picked up in the word on the top passports but there was one 
[03:00:30]  other guy who helped make this thing happen everybody give it up for gary wherever he is give it up for gary  gary oh come on oh that's a surprise you won't come up why are you why would you boo gary  very small  wow that uh that was haunting yeah it's very touching if you didn't know better you would think uh gary  started uh just before our montreal broadcast yeah that wasn't all montreal very nice no some of 
[03:01:00]  that was uh cleveland and all kinds of memories with gary just a tribute to his participation  which we have the trophy for but yeah but he's not uh he's not coming down for his trophy  now i asked him oh what did he say to come in and he said no oh and i said why oh he said because 
[03:01:30]  i don't want to uh fair fair point well i guess we have time to play the second goodbye song now  why are we gonna get even more sad yes yes people get two goodbye songs on the op and anthony show don't  they oh i've never heard of that yeah 
[03:02:00]  what you say  so long farewell i'll be the same adieu adieu adieu adieu to you and you and you 
[03:02:30]  oh yeah 
[03:03:00]  goodbye  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Watch that door. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, let it hit that ass.  Peace, goodbye.  Hey, hey, hey.  It worked, man.  Up-tempo number.  It's still going?  Oh, yeah.  We'll miss. 
[03:04:00]  I'm quite emotional.  We're all in here eating sweet popcorn.  I'm going back and forth in between them.  Their cinnamon toast popcorn is maybe the best popcorn ever.  It's ridiculous.  I was about to say, the cinnamon roll is pretty goddamn good.  You guys are both jizz drinkers.  You take a couple of cinnamon rolls, and then you have a couple of fucking cinnamon toast.  And you come up with a Malata Mangro popcorn.  Both popcorns will be destroyed. 
[03:04:30]  Aren't they quite similar, the two popcorns?  No.  That one is sweeter and has like a candy-ish.  He's pointing at me.  He's a sweet boy.  It's the Jim Norton popcorn.  Anyone else notice we're done talking about Gary?  That's it.  We moved on to popcorn.  Why would the cinnamon popcorn that, by the way, we have already covered here on the show,  outshine Gary's goodbye?  Well, you know, the last thing was to give him his participation trophy, and he refuses to come in. 
[03:05:00]  We literally covered cinnamon popcorn ten minutes ago.  Yeah.  All right, well.  It's still delicious, though.  Finance?  I'm going to make a demand.  What's the demand?  That trophy stays right where it is until he gets it.  I don't want it thrown away.  I don't want it in the office.  Do Ron and Fez have to leave it there?  Yes.  Okay.  Make sure the boys get the message.  Mm-hmm.  No one touches Gary's participation trophy.  Because you don't want anybody to disrespect his legacy. 
[03:05:30]  That's right.  What does the trophy say again for the people that are just tuning in?  Why are you asking me?  Well, it's not turned my way right now.  It doesn't seem appropriate for the, well, maybe.  Well, it says, world's greatest secretary.  That's what it says on it.  Looks like a little Academy Award figurine on top.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But for a secretary.  Yeah.  Nice. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Why is it so good?  What, you don't think he would appreciate this, Jimmy?  Is that what you're getting at?  No, I don't open.  No.  No more elevator meetings.  Now we could sit in big boy chairs and have real meetings.  What?  Right?  You're going to have real meetings now?  I always wanted a real meeting if it meant getting real things done.  Right.  So you're saying on record you are willing to have a sit-down big boy meeting with Tim. 
[03:06:30]  In a big comfy chair in an office.  Do you feel like you're going to have creative meetings now?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  What?  It was amazing.  Because if you come up with an idea, even a part of an idea, someone like Tim, he can cultivate that.  Right.  He knows how to do it.  I mean, elevator meetings were fine for those guys.  Sure.  But now it's time to have big boy meetings.  So, yeah.  No more turning your video camera on and sticking it in their face so they don't have a meeting with you because they don't want to be filmed. 
[03:07:00]  No more of that.  Well, that might have happened a couple times.  No, no one would ever do that.  There were demands that it did not make my YouTube channel.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  They demanded.  I do remember more than one time you being told, you can film this all you want, but you're not to post it.  Yeah.  The only reason why I didn't post it, it was boring as all hell.  Just like the meeting.  Let the record show.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big boy meetings start next week. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Where we actually plan a real bus trip.  What?  You just canceled the bus trip.  Because it wasn't a real bus trip.  I don't know if you could, if it's, I see a trip to L.A. in our future.  Oh, yeah.  And a bus trip.  And other things.  Combine them, a bus trip to L.A.  Whoa.  Oh, boy.  I see an animation festival.  That's a hell of a drive.  That we need to plan.  Yes, animation festival.  Maybe go back into the comedy show arena again.  Wow. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, man.  Big boy meetings start next week.  You guys are all motivated.  Yes.  L.A. trip, very important for podcasts.  Yes.  Very important.  Oh, we'll go out there.  We'll do our show.  We'll do some podcasts.  No, you just call them up.  You call Rogan.  You call fucking Pollack.  You're Rogan.  You call fucking Jay.  You call fucking Kevin Smith.  And you go, we're coming.  Here we come.  This is what you're putting me on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like how you think, Jim Norton.  That's what you guys do.  Exactly.  I want to say hi to the Death Squad.  Yeah.  They're a powerful group.  Yeah, they are.  And I think the studio will get nicer, too. 
[03:08:30]  Wow.  Save this tape, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Just in case.  Just in case.  Optimism.  When Tim Sabian quits in discussion.  Just in case we have a, I will remember you.  He?  I do imagine that with Tim Sabian.  We're just like, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Still have that goodbye montage song?  Yeah.  For the people that follow the history of the Opie and Anthony show, Tim Sabian is one of  very few that we never had an issue with. 
[03:09:00]  Well.  How about that?  Sabian?  Yeah.  When we worked with him?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no.  We had issues afterwards.  No, we worked with him none.  We loved him.  Because feelings were hurt and all that shit.  But, no, clean slate now.  Yeah.  But he's one of the few we never had an issue with.  No.  He was always good.  He was always good.  Eric Logan almost makes that list, but he was still, he was management, so we, he kind  of, like, you know, had to play both sides a little bit here and there.  But Sabian is one of the few.  Yeah.  Tim's homosexuality was never an issue for us. 
[03:09:30]  Never.  We didn't care.  We didn't care at all.  We're like, hey, look, if that's the age, you'll like him.  Who else makes that list?  Because I'm sitting here trying to think if I could even put anyone else on that list.  I mean, if Eric Logan doesn't make the list, I don't know many bosses he got along with  better than him.  Well, he more or less, he, he got it and he supported us, but he also had to be management  a little bit, so.  Yeah, but then at the same time, he was in his office on Paltalk and a 360 machine.  I know.  You're right.  That was the funniest fucking thing. 
[03:10:00]  The boss had a 360 machine and would fucking give us sound effects back through the phone.  That guy liked the show.  Oh, yeah.  You could tell.  Who else, though, makes the list?  Wiki, you like now, but you, you brought Wiki through the ringer.  Yeah, that's.  But in hindsight, you know, we should have liked him a lot more.  Yeah, he's, he's a.  In hindsight, we don't know what you have.  I'm trying to think, were there any more PDs from other stations we were syndicated to  or GMs or.  How about Oedipus?  Oedipus. 
[03:10:30]  Never any more Chachi.  Almost.  Never any real problems with those guys.  Almost for an Oedipus.  What about Tom from New Orleans?  What about, oh.  Oh, God.  The drink right here in the fucking.  Remember Tom from New Orleans?  He was calling us with hurricane updates from his roof or something.  He refused to leave.  I'm on the roof.  I'm drinking a, I'm drinking a hurricane here at the airport.  Oh, he was a fucked up dude.  You guys were always cool with Dave Dickless.  Oof.  Yeah.  Those meetings with him.  Never a.  You promised him stuff. 
[03:11:00]  Never a harsh word.  I'm trying to think.  I feel like we're missing somebody.  Yeah.  I know.  Tracy Clardy.  Tracy Clardy.  That's right.  Tracy.  I was not crazy about him.  Yeah.  You really have to watch Meerkat Manor.  She told me that once.  What's that?  That show where the meerkats are running around.  Yeah.  You might like it.  They take glasses off. 
[03:11:30]  Aw.  It's adorable.  Your kitten video is doing very well, sir.  It's being picked up by a few sites, I must say.  It's pushing, I think, 40,000 views.  I'm not paying attention, but I've heard 40,000 views in one day.  In one day.  That's not too bad.  Not too shabby.  Your site's picking it up.  You just need a couple of these crazy pet people.  Pick it up, and that'll do it.  I'm going to make a comment video.  Oh.  That's how I'm going to squeeze into your kitten fame. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, you want to see something?  You got a new one?  Well, it's Ileana recorded one.  It's on hers, but I retweeted it on my Twitter.  How come Chip Ruins the Mood is only at a half million views?  I know.  Because it got ripped off.  It did get ripped off.  That should be like fucking six billion views.  Worldstar hip-hop takes your videos, and you don't get the views.  Look at this one.  I think it's sold out.  Look at how adorable this one is.  It's digital.  Is there sound? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Okay, here it is.  The little cat.  Look what he does.  The taco bag.  I'm going to pull this away.  Dude, that's a million views.  That is hilarious.  That's terrific.  Isn't that a funny, cute video?  He's clumsy.  He jumps onto the table, the ottoman, and there's a roll of paper towels there.  He jumps in midair, spins around, hits the paper towels, and falls on the floor.  That's a million views. 
[03:13:00]  It's got to be, right?  It's got to be.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got competition within your own household.  I know.  For viral kitten videos.  The second the cat runs into the room, everyone pulls out their phones and starts just videoing  And the cat waiting for something adorable to happen.  Let's make your kitten the most famous kitten on the internet.  I know.  We should.  My big, fat, 20-pound cat falling off the printer didn't exactly.  That was pretty funny, though.  It was funny.  That was funny.  But it wasn't cute.  Didn't get the views, though.  I don't know.  Everybody was just happy to see that big, fat cell fall off the printer. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it was more of a good, I wished he died thing than a, wow, that's adorable.  We should have had your kitten walking up Misha Tate's body as she was stretching out.  Oh, my God.  That would have been a fucking hit.  That's it.  Oh, here's it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look how fast I got.  What a big, fat fucking pig.  Oh, Jesus.  Why did you say that?  Yeah, yeah.  Chipper was tweeting away yesterday with cat jokes and puns. 
[03:14:00]  Right.  Yeah, Chip Chipperson now has his own official.  Yes.  And it is really Chip tweeting at Chip Chipperson.  Oh, which one is it?  Is Chip tweeting at me yesterday?  Oh, for real.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's Chip.  Can't you tell by the new hip-hop fucking...  Yeah, I saw the hip-hop thing.  I didn't know.  I didn't pay attention.  I thought it was one of the listeners.  No, whatevs.  Wait, which one is it?  Whatevs.  I tweeted at you.  It's just Chip Chipperson.  I saw it, but I thought it was one of the fans.  No, just Chip Chipperson.  Chip Chipperson. 
[03:14:30]  Fuck yeah.  I got to follow that shit.  Chip, I thought you were into metal.  You're all hip-hop.  It's just a fucking cool picture.  That is a cool picture.  Got to say.  Yeah.  Nice.  Fuck yeah.  Lyle Chipperson.  All right, cool.  I'm going to follow that.  Who wouldn't?  Let's get out of here.  It's a good Kickstarter joke you sent to Kevin Pollack.  Or Chip sent to Kevin Pollack.  Yeah.  Oh, you can tell it's the real Chip Chipperson.  Why?  Because under real name, it has Lyle Chipperson. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm hilarious.  He's profiled to cracking people up because I'm hilarious.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Nothing's spelled right.  Tell the truth.  I've had it with you people.  My advice show is next.  Oh, shit.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's okay.  Yes.  Jimmy.  Oh, good.  It's Wednesday?  Yeah.  It is.  Oh, I forgot.  Star Trek Into the Darkness.  Take those.  I don't want them, please.  Stay tuned for Jim Norton.  Yeah.  That trophy stays right there.

And the Jim Norton Show starts now. 
[03:16:30]  Good afternoon.  Or is it morning?  Depends on when you're listening to this.  I was away last week.  As you know, we were on vacation.  Had quite a delightful week.  And why does it not show up on the monitor until, like, how come it shows up in that one but not this one?  Because if the calls start coming in before we can load that software for you, they show up on the other ones, just not that one yet.  All right.  Well, a call, line one, we have a call from Donnie.  In Boston.  Hi, Donnie. 
[03:17:00]  In Boston.  Who's having a writer's block?  Is that what it is, Donnie?  Yeah, Jimmy.  How are you?  I'm good, buddy.  What is it you write?  I'm a stand-up comic.  I've been doing it for seven years.  I love it.  You're the reason why I got into the business.  Oh, thank you, man.  So thank you.  Yeah, I mean, I love my 30-minute set.  But I really want to write a new 30 minutes, and everything that I'm writing lately has just been garbage.  Yeah, that happens.  Now, are you trying to take stuff and just kind of squeeze it into your set? 
[03:17:30]  Like, you don't have to write a whole new 30 and just start over.  You can always just, you know, bring stuff and incorporate it into your set and then add to it, and then you have 45.  Yeah, I'm trying to make the next step from feature to headline, yeah.  Yeah, and so I want to have that extra 30 just in case some things just aren't hitting.  Do you do any open mics?  Constantly.  Yeah, that's what I try to do.  We're something like, or I'll do the seller. 
[03:18:00]  Writer's Block's a weird thing.  Like, the way I do it with stand-up is I kind of have to wait until I'm inspired to talk about something.  So after I shot this last special, which we shot at the end of March up in Somerville,  I couldn't think of anything for probably a month and a half.  So I was going on every night just doing, like, fuck jokes and just kind of talking about what was familiar  and feeling very uninspired, and I was bombing, and I was walking up the steps every night going,  I stink, and I fucking hate my act. 
[03:18:30]  And then finally I went to a bris, and that's what I've been talking about for a while.  And it just affected me so much I just began talking about it naturally.  So I think, personally, I have to wait until I'm kind of inspired, but just keep exploring on stage.  Bring up a few topics you want to talk about and play with, and that's how I did it.  You're going to bomb a little bit doing it, but, you know, or do an open mic where you don't do any of your regular material.  Yeah, I really appreciate your time.  Good luck, buddy.  I know how it is.  Thanks. 
[03:19:00]  It'll clear up, too.  Don't worry.  Just don't give up.  Yes, hi, Rick in Brooklyn.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you, buddy?  I love you, pal.  Thank you very much.  How are you?  I just want you to know that I'm celebrating three years sober, and I owe a lot of it to you.  And I wanted to thank you for that.  You know, I don't know, I know you'd think this is a wacky call, but the reality is a lot of the things that you've said on the air, off the air, and just listening to you and the struggles you've gone through really helped me get through this. 
[03:19:30]  And it's been unbelievable.  A lot of things I always thought I would do, like write all these stories that I had sitting around and all these different things that I always wanted to explore.  I'm finally doing them, and it's just because I got out of the hammock and the sheet belt of being in that world, you know?  Thank you for saying that.  Yeah, you're right, man.  It is, when you get out of the seat belt of being in that world, you can do almost, and it sounds corny.  It does.  That's why I preface it with, like, this is not a wacky call. 
[03:20:00]  The reality is, you know what, I don't know what the future holds, but the reality is what I was doing and how I was living was not going to get me anywhere, you know?  And, you know, I lost a lot of things on my way, and I don't want to lose any more, you know?  Well, you know, I realized, too, like, when I first got sober, I was 18.  I was, you know, so I didn't have a whole lot of living behind me, but they were like, well, it gets better beyond your wildest dreams.  I was like, oh, fuck you.  I just thought it was such a line of shit.  And then when I look back over it, and, you know, sometimes you have to stop and kind of reflect, everything they told me would happen has happened. 
[03:20:30]  Every good thing, again, within reason, that I was willing to work for, I've gotten.  Everything I've wanted, I have gotten.  If I've been willing to do the legwork, you know, and as my original sponsor said, 99% of life or whatever is just showing up.  If I was willing to show up and be present and do the work, I got what they said I would get.  So thanks for the call, man, and good luck.  I'm happy to hear that. 
[03:21:00]  Thanks, Jimmy.  All right.  Take care, bro.  Bye.  Rob in Atlanta.  I cannot see, due to our software lag, what you want.  It's going to be a big surprise.  Hi, Rob.  Hey, Jim.  I just want to ask you, how far into your comedy career, you know, when you were first starting out, did you start to feel like you were kind of catching on and getting it and were actually, you know, funny?  You know, it's hard to say because there's different – I found that I hit different little mile markers. 
[03:21:30]  Like at first, I was, you know, very scared and I didn't think I'd ever be good at it.  But then I made a few comedians laugh like Jim Florentine and Bob Levy and other guys like – and Eric McMahon, these guys that I came up with.  So when comedians began to respect me and think I was funny, then I started to feel like, wow, man, I do have something.  Or I work with Otto or this guy Stan the Man.  You know, like – so the comedian's approval originally made me think I was funny.  At first it's the audience, okay, I got some crowd laughs so I feel funny. 
[03:22:00]  But then when the comedians start to laugh, you're like, fuck, I really am funny.  And then as time goes on, you start to – so maybe, you know, a few months before an audience member made me think I was a little funny and maybe a year or so, maybe more, before the comedian started to make me think I was funny.  And then as time went on, a couple of years here and there, it becomes – well, now I'm not just emceeing.  I'm featuring maybe four years in.  I'm doing a half hour.  That made me think I was funny. 
[03:22:30]  You know what I mean?  It's all these little mile markers.  There's never one definitive moment where I would go, okay, now I'm funny because what gives me satisfaction today or confidence won't necessarily do it in a year from now.  So I kept needing more and more and more.  So after a while, hey, yeah, it's great.  Comedians think I'm funny or the audience.  But am I being funny with what I think is important to talk about or what I want to talk about?  So that became a new thing.  So when I learned how to express my opinion honestly and get laughs, then I became really convinced I was funny. 
[03:23:00]  So I'm sorry to ramble, but it just – it was ever-changing.  Not at all.  Why?  Have you been doing stand-up for a while?  Yeah, I've been standing about eight months.  Okay.  I know, and I kind of go through – it kind of feels like weeks where I feel like some weeks I'm really catching on.  I'm hilarious, and the next week I feel like, you know, I feel like, what the fuck am I doing?  Oh, sure, yeah.  Welcome to the world, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, one more quick question for you just out of curiosity.  Sure.  At the punchline in Atlanta, your headshot, there's a wall of all the headshots, all the comedians. 
[03:23:30]  I was thinking – by the way, not to interrupt you, I was thinking of that wall of headshots in the Atlanta punchline this morning.  Really?  It's funny – yeah, it's funny you should bring that up.  Which – what are my headshots?  Well, your headshot is right by the men's bathroom, like by itself.  There's a wall outside of it that has all the other comedians, and then there's just yours right outside the men's bathroom.  I'm honored.  And I was just wondering if that was – if there was something to that, or if that was like an inside joke or something? 
[03:24:00]  No, I have no knowledge of why it's there, but I appreciate the club putting it there.  Yeah, please take a photo of that and Twitter it, would you?  Yeah, I will.  I will.  All right, thank you.  One more thing.  I love the last two specials, man.  They're getting better with everyone.  I'm really enjoying them.  Thank you very much, man.  I appreciate it.  I was happy with them, too.  Thanks for the call, Rob.  And good luck.  The eight months is very new.  It seems like forever when you're doing it eight months, like, wow, I'm almost a year.  But again, as you look back on it, you'll realize you're just – you're very brand new. 
[03:24:30]  And you just – it's a fun process to keep rediscovering or peeling these layers off what I'm comfortable talking about and what I'm good talking about.  And it's a great journey, man, so keep it up.  866-969-1969 if you want to call and talk to Jim.  Yes, thank you, Iroch.  Yes, Jessica in Bayport.  Hello, a lot of comedian calls today, which is rare.  What's up, Jessica?  Hi.  How are you?  Hi, Jimmy.  Good morning.  I'm good.  How are you?  Good, thank you.  Okay, so me and my boyfriend are both comedians, and I've been doing it about four years. 
[03:25:00]  He's been doing it about seven, and there is some competition.  There is some fighting between us.  I just want to know, have you ever dated another comic, and do you have any advice for that?  Yeah, I dated one comedian.  We dated for, I want to say, a year and a half or two years.  Um, we were very good friends first.  Okay.  We were, you know, she was one of my favorite people before we dated.  And, um, you know, I, in a way, I'm happy we dated, because it's like, I think she's 
[03:25:30]  so brilliant and funny.  I'm happy she's my ex-girlfriend.  And a part of me wishes we didn't, because I'm such a shithead.  The relationship collapsing was almost all my fault.  Like, literally, because I'm an argument.  She'd be looking for solutions in the arguments, and I was always looking to keep it going.  Like, I'm a dick, and, uh, and she was actually really, she wasn't perfect, but she was really  good in the relationship.  And we never-  So we could break up, then, is what you're saying.  No, no, no, no, because we never fought about, we never, we didn't have any competition,  because I've been around a lot longer than her. 
[03:26:00]  So, it's not that I'm so far advanced, because she's about to be on a television show, so she's  going to shoot past me.  Um, but I was just in a stage where I was on the road headlining, and she was, you know,  doing, like, shorter sets here in New York, and her confidence as a stand-up wasn't nearly  what it should have been, because she's so much funnier than she thought she was.  And I would always tell her, like, you're fucking crazy.  You're really funny.  Like, don't ever think that way.  So we never fought about comedy, because I really liked her act a lot, and I thought 
[03:26:30]  she was great and hilarious.  Our fights were all because I'm a, 80% of them, maybe 90% were because I'm an argumentative,  insecure fucking idiot.  But, um, what do you, what do you guys fight about?  Because you should be kind of supporting each other.  Well, yeah, I mean, most of the time we do support each other, but, you know, every now  and then we'll get angry at each other, and he'll call me an amateur and shit like that.  Yeah, that's, um, that, that's kind of shitty.  I remember one time she and I were fighting, and she really hurt my feelings one time. 
[03:27:00]  I had done some dickhead scumbag move, and, uh, and she was screaming at me.  She's like, I can't fucking believe I used to look up to you.  And I was like, oh, oh, that one got me, like, because we were friends, and she thought  I was a really good guy.  But, um, you know, yeah, you shouldn't be tearing each other down as comics.  I mean, there's enough fucking problems with the audience doing that, and enough with hecklers,  and you don't need to insult each other's art, as it were.  You know, that's, we should both kind of be there for each other.  And you'll never get a part that's meant for him. 
[03:27:30]  And he'll never get a part that's meant for you.  You know, you're not a gay couple who will both be competing for the same roles.  Then, you know, you're not going to go out for a sitcom read where they're going to go,  we needed a janitor of any gender.  They're going to say, we need a woman between the ages of 18 and 50, or we need a man between  the ages of 35 and 70, you know, whatever.  Yeah.  So, just enjoy each other.  There's no competition.  You can fucking go out and do gigs together.  That's great.  Yeah, we do.  All right, cool.  And then it's always weird when, like, one of us bonds and the other one kills and we're, like,  secretly, like, ha-ha. 
[03:28:00]  Well, look at Rich and Bonnie.  Rich and Bonnie, to me, are a great couple because they're both really caustic, kind of  shitty people, but so funny.  And they both have amazing senses of humor about each other.  Like, you know, Voss, there's no one takes a fucking joke better than Voss.  And he hits Bonnie really hard and she laughs.  She doesn't get, she's not a baby about it.  You know, I think that their type of relationship is really good, at least as far as comedy is  concerned.  So, good luck to you. 
[03:28:30]  Well, thank you very much.  I love you, Jim.  All right.  Thank you, Jessica.  Let's see.  Ted in Boston.  Who wants to...  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  How are you?  I'm good, thanks.  How are you, Ted?  Good, thanks.  I am not a comic, first of all.  Okay.  I'm just a, you know, I appreciate great comedy.  And you hear those questions named for people you'd love to take out to dinner.  You are one of them, and let me explain to you why.  Thank you. 
[03:29:00]  Not only do I find you incredibly funny, and anyone can tell a dick joke, but sometimes  some of the comments you make under your breath are brilliant.  Thanks.  As an example, I was just listening to ONA.  And you actually can carry on a brilliant conversation about Hamas, or you can carry on a brilliant  conversation about the Middle East.  You're very knowledgeable, and I'd like to know, what is your educational background?  Thank you.  And by the way, as you're saying that, half the audience is looking at the radio going, 
[03:29:30]  he's a fucking idiot!  Well, he doesn't know anything about the Middle East!  They're screaming at you for saying that.  So I, while I appreciate you saying that, half the audience right now wants to choke you  because they think I'm a retard.  But my educational background is I dropped out of high school after a suicide attempt, a fake  suicide attempt.  It was more of an attention whore thing.  In January of 86, I went to rehab when I was a senior, and that kind of fucked me up. 
[03:30:00]  Like, when I went back to school, I could never kind of catch up, and I just kind of stopped  going my senior year.  So I'm a high school dropout, and I went to one semester of community college, which  was supposed to translate high school and college credits.  So I took problems in statistics, I took Western civilization, I took English, and I took biology,  and I got a B in three Fs, a B in English, which was merciful, and Fs in the other ones. 
[03:30:30]  So never got a diploma.  But thank you for the call, Ted.  I appreciate it.  You're welcome.  All right, be good, buddy.  I appreciate your call.  Let's see here.  Luke in Florida.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you doing today?  Hi, buddy.  Hey, I just want to start off by saying everything you do is pretty awesome.  Oh, that's nice.  Thank you, Luke.  Hey, I wanted to ask you, I broke up with my ex-girlfriend of about three years, about a  year and a half ago.  And since then, I've gotten back on the horse, man. 
[03:31:00]  I've started going on a lot of dates.  And right now, I'm at a point where I've gone through several chicks, and I still text  probably 10 to 15 of them on a regular basis.  And, you know, they'll go out with a lot of those girls.  And unfortunately, I still keep holding on to my ex-girlfriend, even when I'm fucking  these chicks.  Like, I still keep holding on to her.  And, like, a lot of these girls that I've dated are good girls, you know, smart, funny,  attractive, Karen, all that stuff that I've looked for. 
[03:31:30]  But I can't seem to shake the ex, man.  Well, what is your ex with anyone else?  I'm sorry?  Is your ex-girlfriend with anyone else?  I believe now she is.  For a while, she wasn't.  Now she is.  Now is it...  Do you want her more now that she's with someone else?  Um, you know, now I've actually started to let her go.  Okay.  She's, you know, with somebody.  But, like, for a long time before, you know, I was thinking, oh, if she's staying single  for me, we're going to get back together.  Now she's, you know, kind of with somebody else. 
[03:32:00]  Carlin, George Carlin had a line, pardon my interruption, George Carlin had a line one  time where he was talking about Americans and how we have, like, you know, I think it was  like, you know, SUVs and all these cars and vehicles.  And he went, too many choices, America.  It's not healthy.  And I think that's the way it is with women once in a while.  It's, I want to keep the ex-girlfriend on a leash or on a string, and I want to keep  the new one.  I want all of these choices.  And when I have so many choices or options, I fuck up and I panic and I don't take any 
[03:32:30]  of them.  Or I wreck all of them because they can all sense that I'm a greedy shithead playing  them against each other and just balancing out which one I wind up with.  And they get tired of their lives being treated that way.  So maybe that's a problem, too.  You know, it's hard to let go of the ex sometimes because, again, we don't want to realize, fuck,  I made a mistake that I can't change.  Right.  Makes a lot of sense, man.  And I, you know, I feel like I'm sabotaging these new relationships as well, almost, you  know, subconsciously when I look back on it. 
[03:33:00]  So I want to get away from that and find somebody else.  But, yeah, letting go sometimes is difficult.  It is hard because I'm still very close to my ex-girlfriend, my most recent ex.  We broke up a couple years ago, and she's still one of my closest friends.  We text every day.  We don't fuck when I see her, even though I still think she looks really good.  It's not about that.  And it's hard.  I have not been able to find anyone else.  I do not have a girlfriend.  I don't think she has a boyfriend.  And sometimes it's hard when you have that connection to just kind of let each other 
[03:33:30]  go and move on.  It's really difficult.  Yeah, man.  And we were, you know, we lived together for a long time.  We did a lot of things.  We grew up together in a lot of aspects.  So, you know, who knows?  Maybe one day we'll end up together.  Maybe we won't.  But yeah, that's kind of how I feel.  Yeah.  About me and you and I.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jim.  Like I said, you're awesome, man.  Keep on doing what you're doing.  And yeah, man, I appreciate you taking the time today.  Take care, buddy.  You know, because the thing is, when you have a relationship that goes awry, people always 
[03:34:00]  say like, oh, what's the best gift to give a woman in your life?  Like, what is the best gift?  Now, sometimes the best gift is to remove yourself from her life because you're shit.  For me, the best gift I can give a woman is to exit the relationship because I'm a louse.  The best gift for any occasion, however, or even no occasion, if you're not a louse, it's  an I love you gift.  Now, what is an I love you gift?  You're all saying, Jim, what's an I love you gift?  I have an answer.  It's a gift that says without words how much she truly means to you. 
[03:34:30]  Because how often do you show your girl how much she means?  Once in a while, you know, you'll walk in the house with like a half a Cialis rod and  you'll wave it at her.  That's not an I love you gift.  That's an I love me gift because then she blows you and you feel better about yourself.  No, showing her how much you love her is what's important.  You want to show her how much you appreciate her and how much you value her.  And it's something she can keep forever.  And she can look at every day to remind her of how much you love her.  So when you do something lousy, she can just look at this gift, whatever it may be, and 
[03:35:00]  go, oh, God, he does love me.  Yes, he fucked my sister right where the shit comes out.  However, he does love me.  Beautiful piece of diamond jewelry will last forever.  And it shows her exactly how special she is to you.  Steven Singer has the perfect I love you gifts for the women in your life.  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com.

[03:36:30]  All right, let's see.  Q, dealing with obsessions.  How are you?  Steven Singer shines through on any computer.  How's that for a fucking slug line?  Good, Irog?  He just canceled.  Yes, sir.  What's up, Q?  That was awesome.  I appreciate that little segue.  That was cool.  All right.  Hey, Jimmy.  First, I'd like to say, man, I really do like and admire you a lot.  I've been listening to the show for a long time.  Thank you.  I've been following you for a long time as well.  You really remind me of like a modern-day Woody Allen. 
[03:37:00]  Thank you.  I'm a big Woody Allen fan and I see a lot of similarities as far as you.  Well, if I had a stepdaughter, I'd definitely remind you of Woody Allen  because I know I'm just as weak as he is, but thank you.  But on with obsession, though.  I'm one.  It's kind of hard for me to step away from obsession.  My thing, like E-Rock, I'm an action figure collector  and I'm obsessed over it a lot.  So, you know, being a married man and everything and responsible adult, 
[03:37:30]  try to switch it and try to calm it down and just focus dead on work.  But now I'm at the point to where I obsess over work,  just being so competitive and, you know, drawing up competition at work  even when it's not really there, you know?  So I was wondering, it's like, even though I'm focusing on work,  is it still a good thing in your opinion?  I mean, any kind of obsession, like I have a work obsession too,  as well as many others, it can be unhealthy  because it begins to take the place of, 
[03:38:00]  like I'm getting the feelings from the obsession  that I probably should be getting from other things  that are healthy or human.  Like what's the difference between an ardent collector  and an obsession?  I don't know.  It's a tough question because I collect,  like I get celebrity photos.  That's one thing I happen to cut.  You can see I'm a collector.  I'm obsessed with them.  Is it unhealthy?  Maybe because I put too much value in these unimportant things. 
[03:38:30]  But the offshoot is I do get good material out of it.  I get funny stories out of it.  I, you know, I get a cool picture out of it if it works.  So there's something to be gained from it.  However, the obsession itself can still be a little unhealthy.  And you don't want to be obsessively competitive at work  because then you're unpleasant to be around.  Anytime you're doing something to kind of fill a vacuum left by something else,  it can be healthy for a little while,  but then that just becomes the new obsession. 
[03:39:00]  So then you need to tone back on that and you leave another vacuum.  Like when you quit drinking, doing drugs,  or if you quit gambling,  a lot of times people eat when they quit smoking.  People put on a lot of weight.  And Bob Kelly put weight on because he quit smoking.  So you go from one obsession to another obsession.  I put weight on when I quit smoking.  You know, it was all about that oral fixation.  And it's not just because your food tastes better.  It's because like whenever you smoke, you're calming your nerves.  You're healing this craving you have for something, for something, this drug. 
[03:39:30]  And when you don't have that, you heal that craving with food or other things.  So usually replacing obsessions gets kind of hairy quickly.  So I would be careful of doing that.  You know, I don't think there's anything wrong with collecting action figures.  If it's an obsession, you probably don't want to do it though if you're married.  Because like Sam, we'll get divorced eventually.  He's now married to a really hot chick.  But believe me, he's a 30-year-old man with fucking awful dumb feet  and an afro and wrestling toys. 
[03:40:00]  She's going to be fed up within six months.  True.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Good luck.  Yeah, don't be too competitive at work.  Because then nobody wants to work with you when you're that competitive.  You know?  Then you're like fucking like Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.  You're like Ed Harris and that.  Fuck you!  Oh, man, he got...  All right.  Let's see.  Jay in Pittsburgh picked up on a network I gave him.  Hello, Jay.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Good, buddy. 
[03:40:30]  How are you?  Yeah, I called up a few months ago.  I'm the guy that's in the Army.  And I'm going to be getting out next year.  Okay.  And I was doing the online radio.  And I actually got picked up by an online radio slash podcasting network.  Did you call because you were thinking about leaving your military career  and you weren't sure?  Yeah.  And I wanted to clarify because I heard something like a few days after on one of the shows.  I'm not getting out completely.  I'm going to go into the reserves.  Okay.  I'm not completely walking away from 14 years, but, you know, I'm going to find a different day job. 
[03:41:00]  Right.  But I wanted to say thank you.  You know, I really took your advice to heart and pushed and just clawed at trying to turn this hobby into something more than just a hobby.  And, yeah, I got picked up a few weeks ago from a veteran-friendly online radio network.  That's great.  And, you know, I want to, you know, say thank you.  And, you know, I just took your advice to heart. 
[03:41:30]  Well, congratulations, man.  That's good for you.  I'm not talking to a guy.  He's probably going to run us out of satellite radio.  Like five years from now, fucking Jay from Pittsburgh will have this spot and we'll be out on our asses.  But congratulations, man.  I'm happy that you pursued it a little bit and, you know, that you're getting something out of it.  So good for you.  And it's smart that you didn't totally walk away from all those benefits and stuff like that.  Yeah, man.  And, you know, in the future, if you ever, you know, once you're fired from satellite radio from this new management, you want to be a guest or something on the show, you know, I would love to have you on. 
[03:42:00]  Thank you, Jay.  Like I said, I've been listening to you for, you know, 10 years.  And your special in Boston a couple weeks, last week, was hilarious, man.  Thank you.  You're awesome, dude.  I can't say thank you enough for being an inspiration and a drive for my own career.  Well, thank you, Jay.  And good luck to you.  And the special is called American Degenerate.  I'm actually having American Degenerate shirts made because my producer came up with such a fucking cool T-shirt that I think people will actually like these and buy these. 
[03:42:30]  But thank you.  It's different from the poster?  No, my face is not on it.  It's got that flag, though.  My name is Jim Norton, American Degenerate.  It actually looks pretty cool.  I say that.  Watch me sell none of them.  I don't know exactly what this call is.  So we're just going to – I like to say – this is like Jeopardy.  What was it called?  Potpourri.  When that snooty Alex Trebek goes to the one that could be anything.  Or potluck.  It's called potluck.  That's it.  Potpourri. 
[03:43:00]  No, they say potpourri on Jeopardy.  Oh, they do?  Yeah.  Oh, thank God.  I thought my fucking –  They don't say potluck.  They don't?  You're right.  You're right.  What am I talking about?  I'm a true white trash.  Hello, Mike in New Jersey.  Hey, Jamie.  How's it going, man?  Good, buddy.  Love you.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, so my wife, I found out in January.  She's a lesbian.  Okay.  She moved out about four months ago or so.  Didn't talk to her until last week.  I haven't seen her until last week.  How long were you married?  Five years.  Do you have kids?  No.  Okay. 
[03:43:30]  And then saw her, and we ended up making out at the end of the night.  Okay.  So just really fucking confused, man.  Don't know how to –  Well, do you think she –  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Do you think she's a real lesbian, or do you think that she just is bisexual and wanted  out of the relationship with you?  Well, when I found out that, you know, like, she said that she was bi.  She, you know, she wasn't sure.  So I think she's still going through, like, some, you know, thing, you know, trying to figure  out herself and all that crap. 
[03:44:00]  And, you know, which I respected.  I was like, all right, let's work this out.  Let's do – you know, let's, you know, go to marriage counseling and all that.  And we tried for a bit, and then, you know, like, I don't know.  She just kind of – she left me four months ago, and then –  That kind of sucks.  I'm sorry to hear that.  That stinks.  Do you want to get back with her, or do you want to move forward with the divorce?  I'm not sure.  Like, I kind of made up my mind a month ago, but, you know, at the same time, it's kind 
[03:44:30]  of tough.  I'm not sure.  Well, is it easier for you that she left you for a woman and not a man?  Oh, it's definitely easier, dude.  Yeah, because if some – I don't know if she's gay, but if she is, or if that's  her inclination, then there's – and if that's truly who she is, then there's  no human power, or there's nothing you could have done differently to make her  not that way.  That's who she is.  Exactly.  That's what makes it a little easier.  I mean, because I fucked up a long time ago.  I mean, I've never cheated on her or anything like that, but I'm an alcoholic. 
[03:45:00]  And I tried to – so all of 2012, I was pretty much sober.  I was doing the meetings and all that stuff.  Good, good.  And then, you know, and then everything hit me in the beginning of January with her.  You know, now I'm off the wagon again.  Okay.  So you basically – you used her as an excuse to drink.  Well, she withheld sex for me for a year and a half during my marriage.  Okay, that stinks, and maybe there's big problems in the marriage, but that's still 
[03:45:30]  no reason to put a loaded shotgun to your head or a loaded pistol and play Russian roulette  because she's not fucking you or she might be gay.  Like, those are awful things, and I'm not saying that they don't hurt, but why would  you, you know, again, put a loaded gun in your own head because she's fucked up?  Well, sure.  I mean, no, you're right.  To me, I would suggest getting back on the wagon first and foremost because to me, that's  probably – if you're an alcoholic and you're back to drinking, then the marriage is an important 
[03:46:00]  thing, but I would say getting sober is the more important thing because whether or not  you work out with her, I mean, how good are things going to be if you're still actively  alcoholically drinking?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  No, it wouldn't be good at all.  I know I need to get back on the wagon, and I realize that, and I'm trying to, but it's  just really difficult, especially, you know, since seeing her last week, you know, for the  first time in four months and then making out with her, it was, like, kind of, like, really 
[03:46:30]  confusing.  Yeah, that is – especially if she's saying she's gay.  But then again, you're still her husband, so, you know, it's – I guess, you know, I  understand why she would make out with someone who she's married to.  Do you think that she just – did you put weight on or something, or were you kind of  smelly or – I mean, I'm not asking you to be a dick, but if she didn't want to fuck  you for that long, were you doing anything that made you kind of gross to her?  Yeah, well, I did gain weight, and I've actually recently lost a lot of weight. 
[03:47:00]  I've actually lost so many pounds.  So you – that's good.  Congratulations, man.  But you were basically coming home 80 pounds heavier and drunk?  No, well, you know, here's the thing, man.  I really tried to work on it.  You know, I was being sober.  I was getting, you know, slimmer, and I was – I was doing everything I needed to  do, right?  And even then, she wouldn't – she wouldn't fuck me.  She actually called me too fat to fuck at one point.  Jesus, what a bitch.  Yeah. 
[03:47:30]  But then, you know, I was working on everything.  You know, I was, you know, trying to work on all that stuff and doing a good job, and  she didn't – she told me.  She didn't forgive me until I found out she was a lesbian, and then that night, we  actually fucked.  That's weird.  Like, the fact that she said you're too fat to fuck, I mean, that's really an awful  thing to say to somebody.  Yeah, and that was like – that was like maybe, like, you know, six months into the  year and a half, you know, hiatus from sex. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of shitty, because she could have said, like, look, you know, maybe  if you went to the gym a little bit, we could work out together.  There's a nicer, much more diplomatic way to say that you're too fat to fuck.  Yeah, there definitely was a better way to put it, I guess, but, you know –  Let me ask you a question.  Let me ask you a question.  Sure.  You're married to this woman.  You're – she says you're too fat to fuck.  She holds out pussy for over a year.  She then leaves you and says, I'm a lesbian, and then throws you a fuck that night, and 
[03:48:30]  then makes out with you four months later.  What is it about her that makes you want to be married to her?  She sounds shitty.  And selfish.  I don't know, man.  You know, you don't choose people you love, right?  Yes and no.  I don't know how true that is.  I think sometimes you don't, and you fall in love, and you get, you know, hit with the  thunderbolt like Michael in the original Godfather.  But I do think it's a choice.  I do think we choose who we love, and we choose who to be around, and we choose who to spend  time with.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  We're not victims of circumstance when it comes to love, especially if you don't have  any children together.  Maybe her taking off is a blessing in disguise because you invested five years.  But, you know, hey, look, thank God you didn't have 30 years with her, and then she does  that shit with you.  I mean, she doesn't fuck you for 10 years.  I mean, who needs that?  Yeah.  Get sober again.  Stop fucking around.  Go to some meetings or whatever you got to do to get yourself sober.  You lost the weight, and fucking keep on going, man.  Great advice, Jim.  All right.  Good luck.  But seriously, try to get sober again. 
[03:49:30]  That's great that you had it for a while.  And are you fucked up?  It happens.  People fuck up.  Doesn't mean that you're doomed to a life of fucking up.  Just, you know, you're on an elevator, and it's only going down.  You can get off at any floor.  All right?  Great, Jim.  All right.  Be good, buddy.  Good luck.  Take care, man.  Let's see.  Gary in New York.  Oh, no.  Lost his job and wants advice.  Gary from down the hall.  Do you know what I want?  I did.  I had a job.  I thought I did really good, and they canned me, and now I'm on that elevator going down. 
[03:50:00]  All right.  Well, what I would suggest, and thank you very much for the call, Gary.  I would suggest just, you know, polish those glasses, put on a wig, and keep on going.  I'm going to tell you, poor Gary.  Gary's a good egg.  I feel bad for him.  No, you don't.  I do actually like him.  I mean, you know, there's times he did things, and I was like, what the fuck?  But, I mean, you know, by and large, I think he did the best he could, and he tried, and  I had some nice chats with him, so. 
[03:50:30]  All right.  That's fair.  Yeah.  I mean, I did like him.  I still do.  I did like he's fucking get hit by a bus.  Mike in Brooklyn.  Men in divorce and how to deal with custody issues.  Ah, something I have zero experience with.  Hello, Mike.  Hi.  How are you, Jimmy?  I'm good, buddy.  Thanks for calling.  I'm a 43-year-old man, divorced, don't get a divorce.  You know, my topic is, you know, basically the bastardization of fatherhood.  Yeah.  The courts don't take us serious.  They take our money.  They take our custody. 
[03:51:00]  They believe the women, whatever they say.  And, you know, I haven't seen my kids in two and a half years, and all because of a false  arrest.  And no matter what I do, I mean, the kids are resistant, but no matter what I do, the  courts don't want to give me visitation.  And it happens over and over.  Let me ask you a question.  And again, I don't know your circumstance.  Even Alec Baldwin, even a guy married to Kim Basinger, that kind of money was screaming 
[03:51:30]  about how they're unfair to men.  They really are, I think, unfair to men.  And I think that what's happening, like with racial issues, I think a lot of the divorce  issues, we are paying for what has happened before us.  Like, I think the fact that women didn't vote or work for so many centuries, and they were  just staying at home and, you know, fucking whipping up eggs and making a cake.  And they had shit.  So if a guy left and they had nothing, and now it's, you know, 50 years later, the courts  are acting like nothing has changed, which is nonsense, of course. 
[03:52:00]  A lot has changed.  The pendulum has swung so far to the other side.  Yeah.  My wife is working.  She's collecting spousal and child support.  I mean...  It's ridiculous, yeah.  It's not isolated just to me.  I hear it over and over.  I see it in the courts, my friends.  And at what point does this stop?  Well, let me ask you, how long were you married and how old is your kid?  My kids are 12 and 8.  I was married for...  This will be 14 years.  I'm still not even divorced.  Okay.  Now, why no visitation? 
[03:52:30]  What happened that they said no visitation?  Well, my wife, right after she caught breast cancer, she basically isolated the kids from  me, and more and more.  I don't know if you've ever heard of the term parental alienation.  I can't imagine what it is.  I've never heard a phrase like that.  It's basically when you, you know, turn one parent against the other.  Right.  Now, were you already separated when she got breast cancer?  No, I went through it with her.  Okay.  I mean, we had a rocky marriage, but I had to know. 
[03:53:00]  Why?  Did you cheat?  What was that?  Did you cheat?  No.  Okay.  No.  No.  Believe me, I can't even handle one of them.  Okay.  Yeah, fair enough.  You know, and I think she was just very, very angry that I was leaving, and she turned  the kids against me.  They're very resistant, and now the courts are saying, all right, go to family therapy.  But the family therapy, of course, you know, will cost like $3,000 a month.  The therapists want like $300, $400 an hour.  Wow.  And I'm tapped out at this point, and the courts look at me and say, so what? 
[03:53:30]  I'm basically living on $1,500 a month in New York City.  She's got to be living on about, between her and my salary, about $8,000 a month.  Wow.  Now, and what was the false arrest for?  Well, we went into the bedroom.  We were talking about me leaving, and as soon as I got to the point where I was talking to  the kids about the kids, I said, please don't turn them against me.  She said, I don't want to talk no more.  So I'm standing to the side of the door, and she opens the door, hit against my foot, 
[03:54:00]  bam, right on the phone.  Hit against my foot.  That's it.  I said, you can, she said, you won't let me out, which I'm kind of, you know, seeing  now.  I think she planned all this.  Right.  You know, and, you know, I mean, of course, they have to take out someone, because that's  the rule now.  And he took me out.  I was in lockup for, you know, 28 hours, had to fight that.  Then the orders of protection came, and it's been two and a half years.  You know, they don't think that men can parent. 
[03:54:30]  They don't think, they don't value us, the courts, society.  I mean, I love my kids just as much as she does.  I could be a parent just as much as she does.  But when 85% of the time, women get custody.  Now, you know, transfer that to a job.  85% of the time, black, white people got a job over black people.  There would be an uproar.  But men are not valued.  They just treat us like dirt.  Well, again, I mean, we do, let's be real honest.  Men run the world.  And I'm not saying that it's right or wrong, but it's the facts. 
[03:55:00]  We do.  Men run the court systems.  They're not run by women.  They're run by men.  Those, most of the, I'm sure there's female judges, of course.  But most of the people making these decisions are male judges, or at least half of them are male judges making these horrible decisions.  I think a lot of it is just emotional laziness on the part of the legal system where nobody wants to think and examine these things.  So people are just looked at like fucking cattle.  You know what I mean?  And that's the way it was for so many years.  So here's the way it's got to be to balance it out. 
[03:55:30]  Next case.  Next case.  And the only answer I could suggest, dude, because I have no experience in this area, is an attorney.  I mean, you need an attorney who can really.  Well, that's the problem, too, is that, you know, her method was capital matter.  It was funny.  I can't save for an attorney because I have to actually live off the $1,500.  And I can't, I can't, I don't, right now I'm representing myself.  You know, who can afford it?  They want a $10,000 down payment, you know.  Yeah, retainer, yeah.  And, you know, it's like the catch-22. 
[03:56:00]  I can't save the money.  I can't get an attorney.  Is there anything you can do that would make her a bit more amenable to working with you?  Well, she has been, and her attorney has been, just get out of their lives.  You don't deserve to be here.  And the judge is just going with it.  My sons were supposed to be going to therapy.  You know, I would say, you know, to work their way through this problem, it is a major problem.  Not to have a father in your life, I would say.  Sure.  And I got proof that they only went four times this year. 
[03:56:30]  And the judge just was satisfied four times January, twice in January, once in May, once in June.  That's okay.  Like, you know, and it's like, you know, at what point do you start, you know, focusing on the mom when after two and a half years?  And, you know, it wasn't even that.  My kids didn't even just isolate me.  They isolated my mom.  My mom had a stroke.  They wouldn't even see my mom in the hospital.  No cause.  And they had a good relationship.  Let me ask you, again, not to cut you off, but because this is very complex stuff. 
[03:57:00]  And, again, I have no experience in it.  And we're not going to find an answer today on why the court systems are the way they are.  Again, a lot of it's just fucking shitty, lazy, cattle thinking, which, you know, believe me, dude, there's a lot of – most men in these situations are not feeling like they're being treated fairly.  And they're probably not being treated fairly.  But if there's nothing that you can do, my only suggestion would be to either go to the therapy or try to save the money to go to the therapy or try to save the money to go to the attorney. 
[03:57:30]  Because I can't think of another answer to give you.  I can't think of an answer that makes more sense.  And it sounds to me like you're ready to snap.  And you're going like –  No, no, no.  Okay, good.  No, no, no.  I'm living on hope.  Okay, no, good, good, good.  I'm glad.  That's – I'm glad.  I'm glad.  If you're on my voice, it's just frustration coming out.  I'm not going to snap.  Okay, good.  That's not the way to do it.  But my only suggestion, brother, would be – and I wish I had a better thing to tell you – try to save up and go to the therapy or try to find a therapist that's reasonable or that your insurance will cover. 
[03:58:00]  Don't insurances cover family therapy?  No, not mine.  I'm a teacher and it only covers individual therapy, unfortunately.  And then there's – what has your therapist suggested about that?  Um, you know, I have a therapist that's willing to work for cheap, but they – I suggest the name.  He had already worked on the case.  And they say, nah, you know, my wife says, nah, I don't want him.  But I don't want him.  So, you know, what her technique is is to go towards those expensive ones this way knowing that, you know, we can't afford it. 
[03:58:30]  Right.  And that way it prolongs it.  And at this point, that type of behavior should be criminal.  I got to run, buddy, because we only got a couple more minutes before the show.  But again, I –  I just wanted to hear my – I just wanted to get the voice out because I think it's a huge problem in society and needs to change.  You need it to then.  I appreciate it.  Okay, ma'am.  And I hope it works out for you.  And again, I wish I had a great answer for you.  But just good luck, brother, and hang in there.  Have a great day.  All right.  You too, man.  I have one more read. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, but I want to get to this guy here who's dealing with sleeping apnea or sleep apnea and has depression.  Hi, Robert in Brooklyn.  I certainly relate.  How are you doing, Mr. Lennon?  Good.  How are you?  Oh, yeah.  As a person who deals with sleep apnea, just lately, you know, I've been doing it for like maybe two years now.  I'm maybe getting like an hour or two hours of sleep a night, waking up every 45 minutes, delusional, not being able to breathe.  Sure.  And just lately, I don't even want to do anything.  Like this whole weekend I spent in my house, just tired.  Well, what have you done for your apnea?  Have you gone for a test?  No, I have not. 
[03:59:30]  That's one thing I've slacked on.  But, you know, I've lost weight.  I've been losing weight with, you know, 40 pounds, did nothing.  I think it made it worse.  Well, a couple things you got to do.  One, you got to go for a sleep study.  You have to.  I mean, I'm going for my third one at the end of the month, dude, to be tested for what they call an ASV machine because I have complex apnea.  If you just have the type where your tongue, which is called obstructive, is blocking your throat, go online.  There's a lot of alternatives to masks.  Now, I don't know if I can use any because the complex apnea makes it difficult, but I use a mouth guard when I sleep sometimes when the mask, this fucking cocksucker place I went, gave me a BiPAP machine, which is not the right machine. 
[04:00:00]  So try – go to your dentist and see about getting a mouth guard, which is a little uncomfortable, but you can get used to it, and it will cost you a few hundred bucks.  I don't think insurance covers it, but just see if you can do that, and hopefully that will help you from swallowing your tongue, and you may get a better night's sleep.  And if that doesn't work, then you may have to go for a sleep study, but you should do something. 
[04:00:30]  Don't live in a depression about it, okay?  Oh, yeah, but also like for a person that's always tired like yourself, like how do you motivate yourself to do stuff?  Because obviously when you're apnea, you're still tired, and you still do a lot of things.  I just do it.  I mean there's no real answer.  How do I motivate myself?  I feel depressed all the time.  Like I said, many times I've thought of hanging myself.  I'm like this is just – I'm not living.  I hate this tiredness.  I got to go to the gym.  It's fucking – sometimes I'm just making myself go because I have hope that it will get better. 
[04:01:00]  That's basically – when I motivate myself, it will not be this way forever, and that's what I keep thinking.  The way technology is changing and everything is changing, I will be able to fix this.  But you got to take a couple of steps too, man.  You know what I mean?  You got to go for those tests.  They're definitely going to take that leap to get to sleep.  Yeah, you should because you make – some people have great responses to apnea masks, and in two weeks or a month, they're used to it, and then it changes their life.  Eddie Trunk and Hard Rock Johnny both have apnea masks, and they say their lives are completely changed by them.  So a lot of people have great, great success with it. 
[04:01:30]  All right?  All right.  Thank you very much.  Hopefully it motivated me.  Good luck, buddy.  Yeah, I hope so too.  Because the question people always ask, like, I don't know if I can wear an apnea mask or not.  Well, it's like, well, would you eat a fake apple made from fillers and preservatives?  I mean, no, you wouldn't.  What about a meatball made that way?  Fillers and preservatives.  Yuck!  Like most people, you want to be able to pronounce every ingredient that goes into your food.  If you cook at home, you use real fresh ingredients.  Now, if you don't have time to cook from scratch, maybe you're busy.  Maybe you work weird hours. 
[04:02:00]  Mama Mancini's meatballs is the answer for you.  Mama Mancini starts with 100% USDA-graded domestic beef for their meatballs and all-natural ingredients like genuine pecorino romano cheese, onion, parsley, and breadcrumbs, eggs, and a little salt and pepper.  I sound like Clemenza when he's cooking.  Hey, Michael, come here.  You might have to cook for 30 guys someday.  They're real ingredients.  That's it.  Mama Mancini's famous slow-cooked Italian sauce is made just as simply as their meatballs. 
[04:02:30]  They start with the whole Italian plum tomatoes, crush them, and then add natural seasonings, which sounds really good because there's nothing worse than an awful meatball, and there's nothing better than a good meatball.  I should put that on a shirt and sell it.  Mama Mancini's adds their meatballs to simmering slow-cooked sauce for the perfect combination of flavors.  Since 1921, Mama Mancini's has never veered from Grandma Mancini's original recipe.  Real ingredients just taste better.  Mama Mancini's slow-cooked Italian sauce and meatballs now available at your local supermarket. 
[04:03:00]  I got through that whole read without tripping on words, and I said, low-pulse supermarket.  I apologize.  I'm an idiot.  I got Mama Mancini's meatballs.  You know how hard that is to say?  Five times?  And I did a good job.  And then I say, you're low-pulse supermarket.  I'm a clod.  Now you have to go.  I know.  I'm made up of fake ingredients.  Shit.  That's what I'm made up of.  That's it for me today, folks.  Jim Norton is now done dealing with your bullshit.
