<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts jokingly complaining about the length of their opening segments and phone number announcements.  A significant portion focused on the botched recording of a Maury Povich show, blaming various staff members – Rick, Stinky, and Awesome Garrett – for the failure.  They then discussed a news story about a plane crash in Milan, Italy, with one host initially unaware of the event. This led into a "Cribs" segment featuring Sandy Kane's disgustingly filthy apartment.  A camera crew (Rick and Steve) accompanied the hosts, documenting overflowing laundry, cockroaches, mold, and generally deplorable sanitary conditions.  Numerous phone calls punctuated the show, featuring regular callers like Lou, Goose, Gabriel, and Dean, as well as a caller claiming to be from a furniture removal company.  A call from Robert about another radio show's "worst job" segment sparked a debate on originality in radio bits.  The "F.U. Line" segment also aired, featuring listener messages.  Kid Rock was present in the studio throughout much of the broadcast, interrupting the "Sandy Kane Cribs" segment.  Jim Norton was also a studio guest.

Kid Rock's appearance included a recounting of a cockroach incident. He discussed his tour, emphasizing the importance of touring due to internet piracy affecting record sales.  He shared his indifference to record company losses, contrasting his attitude with that of other bands like Metallica, and recounted selling his own CDs after a label went bankrupt.  He shared anecdotes about jamming with Aerosmith and Government Mule, his girlfriend's preference for No Doubt concerts, his attendance at a Government Mule show, and his thoughts on R. Kelly's sex tape and its legal ramifications.  His musical tastes (Hank Williams Jr., George Jones), the Black Crowes' breakup, and various sports teams (Detroit Red Wings, New York Islanders) were also discussed. Jay Moore was present, contributing to the conversation with jokes.  Numerous listener calls and humorous digressions occurred, with some of Kid Rock’s music played. The segment concluded with Kid Rock promoting his Madison Square Garden show.

Pamela Anderson was also a guest, the segment starting with jokes about a photo one host took with her and its potential use as a screensaver.  Anecdotes about Chris Penn and Kid Rock's behavior, including drinking and smoking, followed.  The show's main event, however, was a violent physical altercation between Opie and a co-host, "Frenchy."  The fight involved thrown objects, sprayed beer, headlocks, chokeholds, and impacts with studio equipment, resulting in Frenchy sustaining visible injuries, including bleeding from his elbows.  Following the fight, the show continued discussing the brawl, Kid Rock’s music ("Cocky"), and the previously mentioned Sandy Kane "Cribs" segment.  A caller recounted a story about an indecent exposure incident in their office.  Further discussion of the fight, the Sandy Kane segment, and a giveaway of Kid Rock concert tickets concluded the broadcast. A caller also played a comedic audio clip of Tom Brokaw mispronouncing "Milan" and "Amtrak."  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts used highly offensive and vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, hey, hey, mule, mule, mule.  Mama, I want nini.  Mama, I want nini.  Mama, I want nini.  Mama, I want nini.  Yeah.  You know, we got such a busy show today, we got to get right into it.  Right into the festivities.  We can't mess around with screwing up the first minute with stupid sound bites and stuff.  You're not going to want to hear, uh...  You can act like a man. 
[00:00:30]  That or...  The spinning, things like that.  Stupid Frenchie.  You stupid faggot.  No, we're not going to do any of that.  We got to get right into the show.  Yeah, we do that just to kill a minute or two here.  Right.  It's less show for us to worry about.  Oh, he's got it.  It looks like you're just about to roll it over your wiener.  Yeah, stuff like that.  Yeah, why would we do that?  Hey, what's going on here?  Yeah.  Geez, I don't want to get the H, fellas.  None of that today, because we got to get right into the show.  So you're not going to hear things like... 
[00:01:00]  No!  ...things like that.  Hey, man.  Save me a part.  What do you think of stupid?  Stuff like that.  You know, screw it.  We got...  Hey!  Yeah, we got...  Hey, why don't you stop dressing me up like a man, man, and making me dance for you while  you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know on my dad's bed?  Oh, yeah, see, I can hear a lot of stuff like that at the beginning of the show, because  we're busy.  Of course.  And the only reason I give out phone numbers is because that wastes another 30 seconds. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  It all adds up, my friends.  Let's go.  It all adds up.  Going to the O&A archives a couple times a day, that's another four minutes of show we  don't have to worry about.  Let's show more good.  That stupid F.U. line, you think we really care about your F.U.?  No!  It kills a minute here, a minute there.  Gives me an extra ball on the pinball machine.  That's right.  That's right.  Clang, clang, clang, you know.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  That's right.  Whatever, I'll do what I want. 
[00:02:00]  Right.  All right.  Bye.  A couple phone numbers in New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  No one else.  Screw y'all!  Wow!  No?  Bad?  I'm going to say...  Yeah, why don't you pick a city?  I'll pick one.  Portland!  That's ridiculous.  No one calls us from Portland.  I'm giving props to, uh... 
[00:02:30]  Because I'm feeling something.  I know some ratings come out next week.  And I'm feeling...  I'm feeling D.C.  So I'm saying Washington, D.C.  Stop kissing their asses.  I'm not kissing asses.  Because I said D.C. yesterday.  You did?  It was yesterday, D.C.?  And I think we said it the day before.  Oh, my God.  Stop kissing D.C.'s ass.  Ha-la-la-la-la-la.  Hey, thanks for the...  Ha-la-la-la-la, D.C.  Ha-la-la-la-la.  All right.  D.C.  And everyone else outside of New York, a fine number you can use. 
[00:03:00]  866-277-4...  Wow.  Let's go right to the phones and talk to Lou.  Hey, Lou, what's up, man?  Yeah, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Yeah, what's up, Jim?  Ooh.  Yeah, listen to Lou.  Did you guys see Jim...  Did you guys see Maury Povich this morning?  Oh, Maury.  He had the...  He had a...  Don't stare at us.  We are not monsters.  Yeah.  And, yeah, boy, we got clips from that, right?  We all...  We recorded the show, and we're going to be playing clips from that, right? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Holy ass.  I saw this black monkey.  What?  She looked like she went a few rounds with Mike Tyson.  You did?  Yeah.  I didn't see it.  Yeah, Lou, you might as well talk to a wall, because you didn't see the show.  Ah.  It's okay.  It's not like we had talked about it on the air or anything, that maybe we would have liked  to have seen the tape and had some clips of the tape for today's show, because I don't  really remember mentioning it on the air.  Was it brought up at all?  Lou, did we bring that show up at all? 
[00:04:00]  Sure you did.  That's why I came in.  How many times would you say?  A couple of times.  A couple of times?  Yeah.  So you remembered to tune in?  Hell yeah.  Hey, how about that?  Yeah, I saw Monsters All Over.  I'm sorry, we can't talk about it.  Yeah.  Because I didn't see it.  All right.  Is there someone to blame it?  Huh?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who's in charge of the taping of shows?  Because I really don't know.  Who tapes?  Who tapes the shows? 
[00:04:30]  Rick sets the timers on.  Rick's going to blame Stinky.  Stinky sets the timers.  Oh, boy.  Can we get Awesome Garrett in here for a moment?  Oh, boy.  Can we get Awesome Garrett?  Our Garrett is Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett.  With his tussleable hair and fine abs.  I'll say.  How are you?  Hey, buddy.  Garrett, were you supposed to set the VCR to tape Maury Povich? 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  I'm supposed to set the VCRs.  I'll take all the blame.  I really don't care, but I had no idea.  You know what?  It's all of us should have remembered and none of us did.  I would have thought, yeah, that would have been gold.  We had mentioned it a couple of times during the week.  We would have had our first hour of this.  I know.  I know that Maury was having, I mean, it's the title alone.  Please don't stare.  We're not monsters.  Oh, my God. 
[00:05:30]  And I have no idea what this show is, and we have no clips of it, so we can't even talk  about it.  Rick said Stinky was supposed to set the timer.  That's all I know, Opie.  That's all I get out of this investigation.  And you're going to take the blame?  I'm not going to blame someone.  He's blaming you.  Who are you blaming?  I never blamed him.  You're flipping it, dude.  I never blamed him.  I said, you said, well, Stinky usually sets the timer.  And what was the question?  That's a blame?  That was a question.  That's a blame.  Pete, what was the question? 
[00:06:00]  Shut up.  What was the question?  Shut up.  Why wasn't it tape?  That was the question.  That's the question.  Who's responsible for setting up the VCR?  Right.  Okay.  So you're blaming Stinky.  No, Stinky's responsible for setting up the VCR.  So you're blaming Stinky.  But that's blaming Stinky.  That's blaming Stinky.  Yes, it is.  That's answering that question.  Now, whose fault is it that we didn't tape that show?  Yeah.  I said all of ours because none of us remembered that it was going to be on and to run tape on. 
[00:06:30]  Oh.  Is there any way to get that tape?  Ad is being worked on right now as we speak.  And we're supposed to watch it while we do the radio show?  What does that mean?  You're working on an SPS?  Don't we have to kind of watch it so we can comment about it?  Have fun with it?  Well, yeah, but obviously it's not going to get here until probably a little while later. 
[00:07:00]  Rest assured we will not be talking about or hearing anything from Maury's show today on our show today, right?  Is that what I'm...  Can we possibly talk about it tomorrow?  Led to believe.  That's the goal.  The goal.  Right.  So we'll also have today's news tomorrow.  Is there a guarantee that we can talk about Maury and Blake?  So even though everyone else is talking about that old Italian guy crashing his plane into...  Luigi!  We will be talking about it tomorrow. 
[00:07:30]  Because that's what we do now on our show.  We're the day late show.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What?  Norton, wait.  Did I just...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Norton, what?  Put that down.  Put that down.  What?  You don't have an excuse anymore.  You found it on your TV.  What did you just say?  I said, who crashed the plane into a building?  Holy Jesus Christ, you're a madman.  You are so far out of the loop.  Dude, last...  No, no, no.  I got my...  Who crashed a plane into a building?  Did you watch any news today? 
[00:08:00]  No.  I don't...  My TV...  I gotta get my...  No, no.  I'll tell you the problem real quick.  Did you walk through Times Square?  Did you drive anywhere?  Did you see a TV screen?  Did you listen to a news?  1010 wins?  Did you...  No, no.  No one in Times Square.  It's okay.  No, no, no.  Here's what happened.  I'll give you a real quick asterisk here, you big juicy seed man.  I said, why?  Because the guys...  The people who are providing satellite for my building are going out of business, so  now it's a problem to get satellite.  It's been a nightmare getting anything hooked up in my building.  You know, that's why.  I have my TV.  You've heard no media.  No.  No multimedia at all today. 
[00:08:30]  Computer?  Maybe, maybe radio?  No, I haven't seen it yet.  Radio?  No, no.  All I did was call to find out about a couple of comps from friends tonight at the town  hall, which is still a couple of tickets for us.  I actually didn't.  What happened?  Uh, uh, uh, an airplane, a small, a single engine airplane crashed into a building in  Milan, Italy.  Their biggest building there.  Hey, wait, can I interrupt?  Yes.  Why do you have headphones on?  Because I have a microphone?  I am part of the program. 
[00:09:00]  It's you for the VCR didn't work, you douchebag.  What?  What are you talking about?  Now he's yelling at Rick about the VCR.  It's you for the VCR.  It's you for the VCR.  It's you for the VCR.  It's you for the VCR.  You want me to write more lines for you, Frenchman?  Yeah.  You left your brain at home again, you stupid faggot.  You man bitch.  You left your brain at home.  Douchebag.  You scumbag.  Yes, I left it at home with your wife.  Oh, yeah.  You would like that.  She would kill you.  You wouldn't be able to keep up with her.  Oh, yeah, she would.  Yeah, huh?  She likes it like that. 
[00:09:30]  She takes it in the dump.  Yeah.  She does.  She's my man.  She likes it.  Oh, she loves it.  Yeah.  Especially when she's covered in it.  All right.  Wow.  So was it obviously a suicide thing, or was he just a terrible player?  No one knows.  He was a 75-year-old gentleman from Switzerland named Luigi,  so they pretty much canceled the whole thing thinking it was terrorism.  Especially coming from Switzerland.  A 75-year-old guy named Luigi from Switzerland doesn't quite fit the profile.  Switzerland can't even figure, you know, can't even make a decision between paper and plastic. 
[00:10:00]  How big was the building?  It was a 29 stories, is it?  A 30.  Did they say that?  That's the biggest building?  That's the biggest skyscraper in Milan.  It is a Cemento skyscraper, and it took out the entire, two entire floors, went right through.  So the back end, it's a pretty thin building, but it looked like he had hit it on an angle and kind of ripped right through it.  How about this? 
[00:10:30]  Enough with the goddamn Cessna planes and enough already.  Enough.  Enough with the Cessna planes.  Yeah, enough.  That little monkey-looking kid in Florida crashes a plane into the building.  Now this stupid old Dago, I'm so tired of the planes being cracked.  Enough.  I hear he was trying to avoid Donkey Kong throwing barrels at him as his brother Mario was going up and down the stairs of the building.  This was probably just an error, a pilot error.  I'm sure it was an error.  He probably had a heart attack or something.  It could be.  Trying to, you know, fly or something. 
[00:11:00]  What happened to the guy getting sucked in with a jet engine?  I'm having chest pains.  We'll get to the sucked in the jet engine story in a little bit.  Do you know that kid from Florida?  His mother is suing the company that makes Accutane, the medication that rids these kids of acne.  And she's suing the company because one of the side effects could be some kind of a mental depression or whatnot.  And she's suing the company.  Anything to get a buck.  I know.  The kid should have aimed for his own home as Mommy waved. 
[00:11:30]  Watch the propeller.  The last thing you see is the propeller hack his mother apart like a Cuisinart.  She should have sued her uterus for making her son look like a monkey.  He was awful.  Robert, what's going on, bro?  Oh, good.  Hey, man.  What's up, Robert?  Did you happen to listen to Donald Mike this afternoon?  No, I did not.  Sorry.  Well, they had a totally new and original contest.  You want to know what?  They had people call up, and they had to say their worst job, and whoever had the worst job gets the prize. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  That doesn't matter, though.  Here's the deal.  You guys were talking about it yesterday.  Oh, wait, wait.  Here it is.  Hold the phone, Robert.  Hold on, Robert.  I'm going to let you in on something, okay?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's true.  We were talking about worst jobs yesterday on our show, and we want to continue that bit,  by the way.  But the worst job bit is probably one of the oldest radio bits on record.  Yeah, it's not a bit thing. 
[00:12:30]  It's a discussion that you can have that's been done a thousand million times on the radio.  I would not consider that stealing a bit.  That's Jesus Christ.  That's just one of those really old benchmark bits that probably every radio guy in America has done.  It's just the way you do it on the show, and hopefully you can make it a little more entertaining than the next guy.  Well, they started it as the worst job.  Yeah, it's a really old bit.  Yeah.  There's a bit called Battle of the Sexes that just about every morning show in America does.  They take calls from men, and they have to answer questions that only women would know, and vice versa. 
[00:13:00]  If I may say vice versa.  Ah, it's awful.  Who would listen to that?  People do.  Yeah.  Well, they changed their title.  That's the only thing.  After the break, they said certain DJs might get mad.  Wow.  We can't get mad at something like that.  Why are you going to get mad at that?  That's literally one of the oldest radio bits in America.  I just thought of you guys, because, you know.  No, I appreciate you sticking up for us, but...  And then some guy called and said you were all that.  When we did it yesterday, there had been hundreds and thousands before us that had done it. 
[00:13:30]  It's one of those things that you just fall into it.  I did that.  I did the bit at BAB.  Right.  Ten years ago.  Doesn't matter.  And I think I did it during my college radio spin as well.  And 20 years before that, I'm sure maybe Cousin Brucie brought it up.  Without a doubt.  I hope he is.  Nah, Robert, that's just one of those things, man, that's been out there forever.  For us to scream about that, we would be psychos.  Please.  Psychopaths.  All right.  Thanks, Robert. 
[00:14:00]  What's going on now?  Frenchie is commenting on everything.  Now Steve has the same question all of us do.  Why?  Why is the frog wearing headphones?  That's what I said.  You big bully.  Why don't you go down to that French demonstration that's happening down in Manhattan?  You hear about that?  They left themselves.  You hear about that?  A bunch of French people are down there protesting anti-Semitism.  You know French a bunch of faggots, right?  Are you, uh, why are you calling Steve a bully?  There's one guy you shouldn't be lipping off to right now, dude. 
[00:14:30]  Wow.  Well, that's how I have my head in the wall, right?  You have your head firmly planted in your own ass.  We won't need that lamb blood.  We use Frenchie blood.  Use your own.  Ouch.  Oh, God.  Take a walk.  All right, I'm turning off Frenchies, Mike.  We don't want to burn them out, eh?  Nah, don't burn them out.  Don't burn them.  Burn Lebanese legs.  Ever tan from throwing legs?  Is he wearing shorts, Terry?  Yes, he's wearing shorts. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, he's got the cinched.  He's got the cinched shorts.  Hair is placed wispily around the calves.  Very nice.  And the Backstreet Boys beard.  Exactly.  He's lost so much weight now, and he's wearing the shorts.  I feel like he should be spinning around going, 1-800-99-Jenny.  Leaving now.  Oh, come on.  Foundry Music Jared.  Steve, Steve, where are you going?  He's going down the subway for a sandwich. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, where's Mary?  Does she still do opera?  Of course.  Yeah, Mary's here.  Opera Mary's here.  All right, why don't we take our first break.  Jay Moore stopping by today, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, cool.  Jim Norton in the house.  Big show tonight at the Town Hall.  Yeah.  Very excited.  Our latest installment of Cribs.  Yes.  We're doing Sandy Kane Cribs today.  Oh, oh, oh.  I think Rick and Steve are leaving the building as we speak. 
[00:16:00]  I hope they are wearing full-body condoms, because you can only imagine the horror that is her home.  We've been trying to do Sandy Kane Cribs forever, and finally, finally, we worked it out with her.  So, they're on their way.  Yeah, they're on their way, they'll videotape it, and, of course, we'll end up with the other fine installments of Cribs we have done in the past on foundrymusic.com.  Dot com.  Also, Anthony, a very special guest stopping by the O.P. and Anthony show today. 
[00:16:30]  Very special guest.  Very special guest or two.  Right.  Stopping by the O.P. and Anthony show.  In about an hour, I think.  Is it one of those guests we can't mention?  We cannot mention.  No, no.  Or certain very short people get annoyed.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's close enough.  Yeah.  That's all the info will give.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Wonder who that could be.  If you work for that other station, today would be the day to put on your Kevlar suit. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, put on the Kevlar, and don't be standing near any gold records hanging on the wall.  They could fly at you at great velocity.  Yeah, so a very special guest on the way in about an hour.  And more of your phone calls, so stay there.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  Theater of the mindless. 
[00:17:30]  Disturbed.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  A couple phone lines open in New York.  877-692-1027.  Goose wants in real fast.  Goose, what's up, bro?  Hello?  Goose!  What's up, man?  Hey, speak.  Yeah, yeah, dude, dude.  You gotta talk.  Right now.  Goose.  Oh, my God.  I just heard him go, yeah, I'm on O.P. and Anthony.  Goose!  Hey, ass. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, douchebag.  Goose!  The guy that just said, no, you're not.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  Hey, stupid, talk!  How are you?  Let's listen.  Let's listen in to this moron.  They're not mornings.  Mornings?  Hey, idiot.  Goose!  What did he talk about how he's at the registry all morning trying to get his nap plate changed?  Listen to this guy.  Hello?  Hello?  Goose.  Hey, douchebag.  You might be effing with us. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, are you effing with us?  Because you're doing a fine job.  Goose.  Hey.  Why'd you play in the radio?  Yeah.  That guy's great, actually.  He's fantastic.  I like him.  What an idiot.  No, I think he was effing with us.  Yeah, and he did it well.  You think?  That was pretty good.  I think he got us really good.  What?  I would like to sit here and act like you didn't, but I think he planned that whole damn thing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I wonder where he was going to go with it. 
[00:19:00]  Just keep doing that?  Yeah, just keep doing that.  Hello?  Because he's a...  You know Goose?  Yeah.  He calls the show from time to time.  He's a hardcore fan, and he knows how we lose our effing minds if the person's not there  when we go to him.  You think so?  Yeah, so I think he was playing off that.  And then every so often he goes, hello?  Yeah.  No, it's the...  Yeah, no, I heard you.  Yeah.  As we're just getting all pissed off, and then...  Yeah, hello?  It's going to be his little bit.  That's a funny bit.  That all the other listeners will steal.  If it was a bit.  Because there's one guy that calls in as Rocco, now we've got ten guys that call in as Rocco. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, but the original Rocco guy's the best.  And then we had one guy call in as DeVita, now we have ten DeVitas.  And we can't even...  And then the DeVitas sound just like the Rocco's.  Yeah, and we can't even prove which one was the original DeVita.  Right.  It's a mess.  That's kind of sad.  When the listeners comes up with a bit, let them have it.  Right.  You know?  Let him bask in his own glory.  Yeah, he came up with a good bit.  Let him go with it.  Come up with your own bit.  Thank God we don't have ten Frenchies. 
[00:20:00]  Gabriel.  Dude, I will hit you.  All these other guys are pussies.  I will knock those glasses right off your French head.  Gabriel, what's up?  Gabriel.  Hey, Tommy.  You're going to take that?  Gabriel.  I was kidding with you.  All right, now I'm starting to think that it's the National Phone Lines.  Hey, Gabriel.  Dude from Portland.  You.  Oh, my God. 
[00:20:30]  Unless it's the same guy.  It ain't the same guy.  Try one more other line.  Try another line.  Yeah, but no one has anything...  All right, I'll...  All right, we'll go to Dean.  Dean from D.C., what's up?  Okay.  Hey, hey, hey, Dean, what's up?  Dean.  Yeah, yeah, our phones are screwed up.  Dean?  Oh, God.  Dean.  You guys connected me.  I totally cannot hear you right now. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, see, he can't hear.  Oh, boy.  I was working on the pinball machine.  This is a National Line called D.C.  Can you hear me?  I couldn't fix your phone.  Dean, we can hear you.  Yeah, maybe it is your phone line.  He can't hear us.  He's probably listening now.  You know what?  Maybe the listeners have a conspiracy going on.  Maybe they all got together in the chat room and said,  Hey, F with O.P. and Anthony all day today.  A gay chat room?  Uh-oh.  Dean, can you hear us now?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, boy?  Oh, what happened?  Pete.  Pete Johnson.  Hold on. 
[00:21:30]  Hold on, Dean.  Pete Johnson, please tell us what it was.  Wait, Pete, get on the mic and tell us what it was, man.  What did you do, you little angel?  Yeah, who's going to solve all our problems when you retire?  Pete.  Some idiot.  Yes, what's up, boys?  What happened?  Someone clicked what button off?  This little button right here, right?  Yeah.  So it needs to be on instead of S?  No, both red lights should be on.  Both on should be on.  Right.  Nice.  Pete, this isn't what you were talking about outside, was it?  No.  About a light being on?  I heard something being talked about. 
[00:22:00]  You aren't goofing on us, are you?  No.  Who, me?  No, Pete Johnson, our crack engineer.  I was repairing the Terminator pinball machine because when the ball went into the head,  it didn't pop up into the gun.  I love that guy.  The bumper, Pete, the bumper to the right of the flipper, it doesn't bump as good as  the left bumper.  Could you get it bumping?  Don't use that side.  Pete Johnson has become the premier pinball machine repair technician. 
[00:22:30]  Because every day there's something wrong with that pinball machine.  But, Pete, you learn, you adapt, you're like the MacGyver of everything.  You appreciate it, Pete Johnson.  Hey, Dean.  Yes, sir.  How y'all feeling, man?  Good.  What you want to talk about sucks.  We were just using you to make sure the national pull-up work.  I did want to say that I took your advice and checked out the job last night.  Yes.  What do you think?  Funniest effing show I've seen on TV in years.  Isn't it, John?  It's outside network television, got something good on it. 
[00:23:00]  I don't even know if they're going to pick it up next year.  Yeah, hopefully they will.  But Lenny Clark in the gay outfit, what do you think?  Oh, it's hilarious.  My favorite part, when the little faggot walks up with the dog and Leary was smoking a cigarette outside.  Yeah.  And the faggot's like, he really likes you.  And Leary's like, yeah, keep walking.  Yeah.  Move along, move along.  It's funny, I lost it at that.  The writing is really, really well done on the show.  Oh, man, I can't wait to see you guys on there.  Well, if they pick it up, Dennis and the gang said they would get us on there somehow.  Yeah, hopefully put them over the top.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  All right, well, take care.  And I love you at BC.  And what's up, little Jimmy?  All right, cool.  Thanks, dear, fella.  Take care, guys.  I think we're supposed to hear from Adam Ferrara at some point today.  He's supposed to call up.  He's doing the Tonight Show.  Didn't he do it last night?  No, I think he's doing it tonight.  That's why he was out there.  Oh.  And he's doing it tonight.  So we've got to get him on the line, too.  I mean, that's...  He's working on the job that wasn't in the studio yesterday.  My pal on the goddamn Tonight Show.  Jesus Christ, how far he's come.  So hopefully we'll hear from him today. 
[00:24:00]  I don't think you're raiding his life anymore.  Is that what it is now?  Do you honestly believe that he's gotten so big that he won't even talk to the likes of us anymore?  Bastard, I remember when he was selling those friggin' binoculars.  Don't give me that crap.  I'll bring him right back down to earth.  All right, Gabriel's finally calling back from Portland.  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  And now we need Gooch to call back because he wasn't effing with us.  Yeah.  Gabriel, what's up?  What's up, O&A?  Can we just call you Gabe?  Yeah, call me Gabe.  That's what my friends call me.  All right, cool. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, you know what?  It's about time you started giving Portland props, man.  Don't call me late for dinner.  We only found out yesterday we're on in Portland.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Damn it.  Do I have wow all over my car yesterday?  People are looking at me like I'm a friggin' idiot.  All over the damn place.  I'm looking at chicks that are looking at me like I'm a hideous, like I'm a moron.  See, this wow thing, it takes time because, you know, not all the ladies understand what  the wow means, especially in the new city.  Right.  Hey, my buddy here wants to talk to you.  Uh-oh.  His diet. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, did you hear what I did today?  I flew a plane in Italy.  I'll tell you what else you did.  An awful impression.  Hey, Norton, blow me, you meaty little bastard.  That stains a few.  Hey, huh?  You know, Rob's Dangerfield.  Hey, I'm the Dice Man here, huh?  You're doing Dangerfield, not Dice.  Let me tell you about my doctor, Vinnie Mubats.  You know?  Hey, Opie, I heard a rumor about you, man.  I've got to ask you something.  I'm Dice.  Sir, ten minutes before he died, Ben Booth would have sounded more like Dice than you  just did.  That was horrendous. 
[00:25:30]  I know.  It sucks.  I hate the guy.  Hey, Opie, I heard a rumor about you.  I've got to ask you something.  Go ahead.  Jim ruling?  Jim ruling?  Ruling, Jim?  Oh, he got you so good.  Come on.  Of course you've got to go, what's the rumor?  Jimmy loves that, man.  He's like the proud pompa launching his kids walk.  It's so awful.  But the guy goes, you know, he heard a rumor. 
[00:26:00]  You've got to ask what it is.  That's going further than when you say, you know, one other thing.  You snap his phone shut.  Oh, we always do that.  I actually got that from Keith because I was talking to somebody who goes, ah, oh, that's  it.  Let me say hi to him.  I'm like, here, just take the phone.  You've got to really, obviously, hold the phone up and snap it shut.  Oh, he did get you.  You have to ask.  You know, regardless if you believe he got you or not, for how funny it was, you've 
[00:26:30]  got to give it to him.  I'll give it to him, but.  Yeah.  Because you actually.  No one in this.  Yeah.  What else?  Yes.  Oh, like you guys would just realize he's getting it.  Yeah.  I would.  I've gotten it.  I can't get it much in a while.  We've installed it because we've been waiting for Rick and Steve from foundrymusic.com to  get on site.  Wow, she must live close.  She does live close.  Oof.  She lives right in the old Times Square district. 
[00:27:00]  Ah, back when it was.  She's probably been there since the days of the real Times Square.  Well, you know Rudy Giuliani when he was.  The seedy Times Square.  No horses and buggies.  No hookers and pimps.  When Rudy took office, he made his mission to clean up Times Square and he had done.  Before that, though, back when Sandy was living there and in her heyday, whenever the hell  that was, the place was just an abomination of porno and filth, it was great. 
[00:27:30]  It was beautiful.  And I guess she lives really close to that area where she could have just rolled out of  bed and rolled into the peep show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So let's go and say hi to Rick, who's in Sandy Cain's apartment.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  We're not really in her apartment just yet.  We're standing outside her door.  Oh, you're going to do the big cribs entry? 
[00:28:00]  Of course.  And it's, dude, she lives in a great building.  Really?  This is really, she's got six elevators in this building.  How does she make her money?  I have no idea.  Me and Steve are walking up to the building like, this can't be the place.  And we're checking the address, we're checking the address.  I hate to think she has a good apartment.  This could be a bad installment in the cribs.  It's probably that she lived there, dude, and got some rent deal years ago, and maybe  it's rent controls.  Maybe.  You don't understand.  There was a couple guards. 
[00:28:30]  They had this whole sign-in system.  They had a ring upstairs, computerized.  Wow.  Yeah.  So I don't know what we're going to expect when we actually open the door and go inside,  but then again, it's Sandy Cain, so, you know.  Hopefully it's.  Is it nice?  Jesus.  How is she making her money?  I love to eat and sucky.  All right, Frenchie.  Goddamn Frenchie.  Relax.  She's making it sucking.  She was sucking it, sucking it, and sucking it. 
[00:29:00]  And taking it in the dumpster.  That's how she made all her money, that whole.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Look at her now.  All right.  That's great.  All right, Rick.  All right, so we're outside the door, and I'm going to ring the...  She has a bell.  Oh, let's hear.  All right, let's see if we can hear it.  No one has a bell in New York City.  There it is.  There it is.  I thought it went...  Yeah.  Oh, let's listen.  Oh, hi.  Come on in.  Oh, God.  And we're walking inside of the apartment of Sandy Cain, and I must say, looks outside 
[00:29:30]  can be deceiving once you get inside.  Oh, good, good.  Rick, what does it smell like in there?  It's hard to pinpoint, actually.  I just picture, like, old woman's stockings.  Okay.  Old woman's sweaty stockings.  And then it adds smelly ass to that.  Oh, it smells like ass?  Mothballs and butt.  Eh, eh.  Ah.  Yeah, and she's doing that.  She's walking around here. 
[00:30:00]  All right, so what do you see so far?  Yeah, what's the entryway?  What's the first sight that greets you as you walk into her house?  The first sight is her, uh, the first sight is, well, Sandy, this will be your bed, correct?  Yes.  What, you're already to her bed?  It's right by the front door.  Oh, it's right by the front door.  That's so they could come in, bang her, and just leave.  Get out.  What?  She says she's getting into one, though.  Yeah, it's a square red. 
[00:30:30]  But, uh, as I look around, it's decorated very tastefully in different colors of a, uh, milk crate.  Explain.  Milk crate.  Rick, explain why the bed is at the front door.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sandy, why is your bed so, well, I guess because it's because it's a couch.  She has a fold-out couch for a bed.  Yeah, she's got a fold-out sofa bed.  Does she have a bedroom in that apartment?  Is there a bedroom in the apartment?  Hey, you're ready.  You're ready.  Oh. 
[00:31:00]  Wait a minute.  There's no other rooms?  There's, they, let me see.  I see a doorway here, but it's probably, yeah, it's just a small little, little, uh, Hobbit-like kitchen.  It's a studio.  So, so, that's it.  She's got a studio apartment.  Yeah, she's got a studio apartment in an incredible building with security and all that stuff.  She's probably in a maintenance closet.  And I'm rounding the corner.  Hey, Steve, get a look at this.  Her closets are filled with all these clothes that look like, like when you're walking past 
[00:31:30]  the big dumpster and then somebody's dumped a lot of clothes.  That's her closet.  Well, make sure she holds some up and describes them for the video camera.  Yeah, they'll fill the whole thing.  Sandy, come on over here and tell us what we have in your closet.  Sorry, Sandy, clean it to the wall.  Oh, my God.  What?  The door?  It'll fall on you.  All right.  The broken door almost fell on you.  Yes.  Come here.  I didn't clean it.  Dangerous.  Why don't you give us a quick tour of your closet?  This is a dirty, what is that, a comforter, everything dirty, the closet smells of B.O. 
[00:32:00]  Ah, the closet smells of B.O.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  You know what you're going to have to do?  You've got to take one for the team.  No.  Find her hamper and pull out a pair of panties, preferably light-colored ones, and let Steve  get a good view with the camera, please.  All right.  It's going to look like a Picasso painting, a shoeshine rag. 
[00:32:30]  Someone spilled cranberry juice in there.  Where would you keep your, no, no, no, your hamper?  I don't ever do a wash, so I don't have a hamper.  Wait, wait, what?  You don't do wash, so you don't have a hamper?  You're right.  I really don't have a hamper.  What do you do with your dirty clothes?  What do you do with them?  What do you do with your dirty clothes, Sandy?  I put them in suitcases.  Everything's in there.  I get there, that's my hamper. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  Hey, hey, hey, Rick, Rick, Rick.  All right, hold on.  I'm walking over.  Got that in.  Could you put Sandy on the phone for a minute?  Yes.  She puts her dirty clothes in suitcase.  Yeah, let me, I got to, I got to get to the bottom of this.  This is brilliant.  Actually, these suitcases are beautiful.  Big garbage bags that I'm going to start trouncing through them.  Hold on.  Here's Sandy.  Oh, you're not going to look at it.  I'm going to look at it.  Hey, Sandy Kane.  Take off the phone.  Oh, God, this is going to be so frustrating.  This is going to be so frustrating.  Don't you own a phone? 
[00:33:30]  No, I'm not one of these.  Put it to your ear.  Oh, okay.  Hello?  Sandy.  Yes.  Hi.  Can I ask you a question?  Sure.  All right, Sandy Kane.  When, and be honest and really think about this.  When was the last time you went and got your clothes washed?  Well, I have a washing machine right now, sorry.  But, uh, uh, the truth, uh, it's been such a long time.  I, this is, um, I, this is, um, I, this is feathers.  It's all my strip clothes are here. 
[00:34:00]  I put it all.  Sandy.  What's wrong?  Sandy, can I ask?  A mouse.  A mouse.  Uh-oh.  Well, I think a mouse bit Rick.  Hello, what?  I'm not.  Rick.  What?  Sandy, so you wear your dirty clothes?  Of course.  I found one.  Well, I found my roach.  Pins.  Do you have roaches?  Hello?  Do you have roaches or mice?  No, not yet.  We haven't seen one, but who knows?  All right, put Rick back on the phone.  Oh, is it smell?  He's smelling my, oh, you don't smell it, Rick.  He's smelling my G-string. 
[00:34:30]  Ah.  No!  No, he is.  Come on, Rick.  Come on.  Phew.  I know.  No wonder why that stinks.  Sandy.  What?  Sandy, put Rick back on the phone, please.  Opie, she doesn't do her laundry.  Yeah, I know.  She puts them in a bag and then probably just pulls it out of the bag.  All right, what do you find?  It's a leopard and blue, leopard and blue G-string.  Yeah, and is there any telltale marks on it?  I'm afraid it's kind of crusted up in one area.  Oh, no!  Pull it apart with my feet here. 
[00:35:00]  I don't know if it's from bunching or if it's actually crusted.  Yeah.  Pulling it apart with my feet.  Then, Opie, at some point I have to ask Rick to pull the covers down on her bed and get  the sheets.  Get a picture of the sheets right at ground zero, right about where she, that area of  hers would rest on her sheets.  Because if she doesn't do the wash...  All right.  I don't see any telltale signs.  How do her sheets get clean?  What, Rick?  I don't see any telltale signs on that particular pair, but I'll keep looking. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  All right.  What is the walls adorned with?  Nothing, really.  A 1998 calendar.  From Tower Records.  98.  Great.  I see versions of her hair.  What do you mean, versions of her hair?  Well, you know how she comes in with...  The wings.  Yeah, with the wings.  I thought she had one.  Well, no.  There are at least three or four of them lined up over here.  And what are they, on heads, or are they... 
[00:36:00]  One is on a head.  The other three are, you know, kind of piled on each other, being held in place by an alarm  clock.  Oh, my God.  I hope he's taking a goddamn phone call.  Who's calling you during the show?  What?  Hold on, Rick.  Hey.  Is this the village?  No, this isn't the village.  Who are you calling?  And what, you got furniture that needs to be taken out of your apartment? 
[00:36:30]  Say, yeah, we can do it.  So you have furniture outside your building?  Yeah, we can do it.  Hello?  Well, where's the furniture?  All right, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, you got furniture in your house, and you're going to take it...  Yeah, but I'm confused.  You're going to put the furniture outside, and then what?  You can't just leave the furniture outside.  You got to call someone to have them take it away. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, that's why you're calling me.  Right?  Is the furniture old and dusty and stuff?  How old is it?  Yeah, 10 years old, that's too old.  We don't touch the furniture that is that old.  Yeah.  Why are you yelling at me? 
[00:37:30]  I wasn't the one that picked up the one piece of furniture.  I'm telling you that your furniture is too old.  10 years old is old.  I don't want my guys getting bit by bugs or anything.  You want to talk to somebody else?  Just someone that works here.  Hold on.  I'll give it to my supervisor.  Hi, ma'am.  How can we help you?  My name is Pete Johnson.  I'm the...  Pete Johnson, yes. 
[00:38:00]  The town of New Hyde Park.  Yes, yes, ma'am.  What can we do for you, miss?  I want to help you.  You have an old couch and a chair.  It's 10 years old.  You'd like to have it taken out.  An old couch and an old chair.  Picked up from outside your house, ma'am.  So are you yourself going to bring this furniture outside?  And my partner here has told me this is old furniture. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, 10 years.  See, we've had problems, especially in the New Hyde Park area, with diseases and bugs like mites and whatnot that have sickened.  No, that's the problem.  We picked up a piece, as you said, a couple of months ago from your home.  Yes.  Not months ago.  How long ago was that, ma'am?  Your name is Mrs. What's your... Mrs. Keller? 
[00:39:00]  Keller, yes.  We did pick up furniture from you.  And the people were sickened by it.  They got ill.  You have some type of bugs in your home?  Yes.  And they were bitten by these bugs.  And they got really sick.  So you are red-flagged, your home, that if you bring furniture out now, you have to prepare it, wrap it in plastic, completely sealed and duct tape. 
[00:39:30]  And then we will come by in hazmat suits.  Yes.  How did my little friend...  Are you calling me my little friend?  My partner over here?  You're calling him my little friend?  Miss, we don't...  Missy, Missy.  We don't take kindly...  Missy.  We don't take kindly...  My name is Pete Johnson. 
[00:40:00]  I don't...  We don't take kindly to having house frows such as yourself yelling at us.  Hello?  Hello?  She's very angry.  She was angry with me.  You pissed her off.  I did?  She said, you tell my little friend.  Why?  Yeah, why is your phone on during this show?  So we can get bits.  He can't help himself.  He has to pick up his phone no matter when it rings.  He cannot...  No.  He's Carl Curious.  Who cares? 
[00:40:30]  That's great.  That's a bit.  There you go, a bit.  There you go.  All right.  Rick.  You.  All right, why don't you take a look around.  We're going to take a break and we'll continue with Santa Cain Cribs, okay?  All right.  Actually, get Steve on the phone real fast.  I want to see what he's thinking.  All right.  Yeah, I'm just walking past the...  She's doing a little stuff for Steve for the video here.  Great.  Steve, Steve, what do you think?  Do you want to comment on the...  Hey, fellas.  Hey, Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Shut up.  Once again, you sent us into squalor to tell you what it smells like.  What does it smell like in the house?  Is it like an ass, like a...  Foot, ass, armpit, just rotting flesh kind of...  Are you serious?  Yeah.  It's just like an unkempt, very dirty smell.  And she doesn't do laundry, we learned.  No, she doesn't do laundry.  The walls are white, but they've got black, dirty handprints all over them.  Eh. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where Sandy Cain puts her hands as she's getting...  Oh, I'm right behind.  Big, you know, like what looks like scuff marks all over the wall.  Like the kind of scuff marks you might see on a floor.  Really?  From knocking, like, black leather boots.  But they're all over the wall.  I wonder what that's about.  Maybe she kicks her boots off.  All right.  Isn't she just...  She's just penis.  Did you ask her what the scuff marks are all about?  About to right now.  Sandy, what are all the scuff marks all over the wall?  I really don't know.  I think that's why I do my... 
[00:42:00]  I don't know.  You don't know.  Okay.  Sandy, how long has the monster been living there?  How long have you been living here, Sandy?  Five years.  I need a paint job.  Yeah.  You need more than a paint job, Sandy.  Well, what do I need?  Okay.  A fire.  There's cobwebs...  This is O'Leary, ring a bell?  There's cobwebs hanging from the ceiling.  She obviously doesn't dust.  The walls are decorated with cutouts, newspaper cutouts.  This is a stalker wall.  Yeah, this is her stalker wall. 
[00:42:30]  This is a very...  Stop talking, please.  Two seconds.  Yeah, Steve has no patience.  I really...  I have no patience for the idiots you send me out to meet.  I mean, really.  Oh, God.  You walk around...  You know what it's decorated like?  It's decorated like a college dorm might be decorated like, because there's milk cartons.  Everything's sitting on plastic milk cartons.  There's no real furniture to speak of other than our closets.  There's no storage space other than these milk cartons that are all over the floor.  Plastic things that she gets off the street. 
[00:43:00]  Cindy, you get these all for free, obviously.  Definitely.  Definitely.  I steal them from my big lady.  Yeah, there you go.  She's stealing from bag ladies.  She steals...  Yeah.  Steve.  Yeah.  Is the bed right there?  Yeah.  She sleeps on a fold-out couch.  A dusty, fold-out, corduroy couch.  All right.  With a leopard-skin comforter draped over it.  Is there...  Wait, is it a bed, though?  Is it a pull-out bed?  It is...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's one of those convertible...  All right.  Are there sheets on it? 
[00:43:30]  Yes.  There is a dirty...  Well, there are very dusty leopard comforter and leopard pillowcases.  Are you able to see the bottom sheet where her ass would be when she's sleeping?  Mm, yes.  Well, there's crumbs all in the bed.  Very rusty, thick breadcrumbs.  That's not crumbs.  Oh, those aren't crumbs.  Those are dead crabs.  She picks her quattro while she's sleeping.  Oh, mashed potato flakes.  She sleeps with gloves on, too.  It must get really cold here. 
[00:44:00]  Cindy.  No, because I scratch my head, so I put gloves on so I don't scratch it.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Don't they do that with babies?  Ask her why she's scratching her head.  Why is she...  Why are you scratching your head?  Because I always might...  I have a very itchy scalp.  Oh, no!  God, she's disgusting from head to toe.  Everything about her is awful.  Everything about...  Now, Rick, peel back...  Or, Steve, peel back that comforter.  Doing it right now.  And let's look at the sheets.  She was close to bed. 
[00:44:30]  Rick, pull it back.  Not because she's cold, so she doesn't scratch her.  Well, all right.  This is pretty custom.  The sheets are dirty, obviously.  They're crust, crumbs, something, everything's scattered all over the bed.  There's a New York Post underneath the comforter.  I don't know why.  Plastic bag.  Ask her why the paper's under the comforter.  Yeah, I'm doing it.  Sandy, why is the paper underneath the comforter?  Why did you have a New York Post underneath the comforter?  I don't know, because they deliver it every day, so I didn't...  No, why is it underneath the frigging comforter? 
[00:45:00]  Because, um...  I read it, because I've got a plate.  Well, all right.  It doesn't occur to you to take it off the bed before you make it.  I never make the bed.  She don't make that bed.  What kind of plastic is on it?  Excuse me?  What kind of plastic?  It's bags from the New York Health and Racquet Club are all over the bed, too.  Why?  She eats on the bed.  She eats on the bed.  Okay, that would explain...  She eats...  Hey, Steve. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah?  Cheesesteak boy wants to know if there's any evidence of Norton and Voss being there.  There are pictures of Norton and Voss on the wall.  Are there?  Yeah, there's cutouts of Norton, Voss, you guys.  Okay.  Daily news, covers.  All right, Steve, we're going to take a break,  so why don't you guys explore a little more  and we'll get right back to you after commercials, all right?  Get some great video and... 
[00:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  Get into a little balloon not eating.  Oh!  Yeah.  I'll leave that for you, sir.  Scratching her head.  Oh, and her gloves.  Her gloves are on.  She has to wear a cat, but she doesn't rip her skull open.  What a zilch.  Chris on Line 10, this sounds more like fear instead of cribs.  Yeah.  All right, Steve, is there a fridge in the place?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I haven't looked inside yet.  We've got a good one, but what's on top?  All right, we're going to look at the fridge and talk about that next  and what's in her medicine cabinet. 
[00:46:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, hold on the line there.  Okay.  There's Rick and Steve from foundyourmusic.com  doing our latest installment of cribs.  Sandy Kane Cribs on the O.P. and Anthony Show today.  Yes, we'll look at the fridge and the medicine cabinet  and, of course, the bathroom.  I'd like to know where she bathes, if ever.  I don't think she does.  If she doesn't do her laundry and stuff,  she swears she doesn't do her laundry.  I can see what she does.  When the clothes get really bad, she just puts them in suitcases.  And plastic bags.  And plastic bags.  It just must smell, like they said, like B.O. and ass. 
[00:47:00]  Somebody just should run in there and smother her to death.  All right, Frenchy.  Also, Anthony, in probably a half hour,  we've got a very special guest.  Oh, yes.  The O.N.A. Show, so stick around for that.  We didn't announce it, but, you know, you know how that deal is.  Uh-huh.  The faithful listeners understand.  A couple of you actually guessed it on Instant Feedback, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they've guessed it.  They guessed no doubt.  It's not no doubt.  No, no, I've seen a couple that have guessed who are real guessed it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Let's go to the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, I'd like to give a colossal F.U. to my co-worker, Daryl,  who never leaves an opportunity to throw me under the bus at work  or make me look like an idiot.  You prune-faced, chain-smoking, player-hating bitch.  Either get laid or get your Prozac prescription renewed.  F.U.  Next message.  This is a big F.U. to Wally.  Listen, if my ex-girlfriend wants to talk about me, she can talk about me.  If you're jealous about it, go nail your horse-faced girlfriend from Vernon 
[00:48:00]  and just nail her until she actually looks good.  Stop imagining you date my ex-girlfriend.  Get over it.  You stick.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Joe from New Hampshire.  I'm going to give a huge F.U. to our F.U. country.  We just paid $10,000 in taxes so people on welfare can get health insurance.  But because I'm self-employed, the F.U. insurance companies won't let me buy health insurance.  And when I do get sick and pay the hospital out of pocket,  I can't deduct the bills because the F.U. and IRS says they make too much money.  I hope everyone in the IRS gets aid. 
[00:48:30]  I hope all the heads of the insurance companies get a bowl of bleed-outs.  And I hope everyone on welfare is forced to get an effing job.  F.U.  End of messages.  Now let's turn on the PA system and start the fun.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Afternoon Radio, this is it.  You can't go anywhere else.  Nowhere to go.  That's like saying you don't like Earth.  You're leaving.  Where are you going?  O.P. and Anthony.  And we finally have control.  Yes.  Gets better every day, don't it? 
[00:49:00]  And E.W.  You're checking out Kid Rock from the cocky CD forever.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm going to blow off Rick.  Yeah, look at that.  Hey, Rick.  I'm going to blow off Rick.  Yeah.  We'll get back to you in a little while, all right?  What do you mean?  We've got Kid Rock in the studio.  Oh, you're not going to leave us here.  You've got to hang there for a while.  No, but hotels are being held in place by spiderwebs.  We found another roach. 
[00:49:30]  Videotape it all.  We'll get back to you.  I don't know if Kid Rock is interested in this.  We'll try to tell him and see if he's into it or not.  We found a nest of cockroaches.  We're doing our own version of cribs.  We do this from time to time.  So there's this chick.  She's like an old stripper from when Times Square was cool.  And she used to work the peep booths and stuff.  And she's a regular on our show.  So we sent a camera crew down there, and they're checking out her crib.  And I guess we're finding out that the pillows are held in place by spiderwebs. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  And she doesn't do her laundry either.  She takes her dirty clothes, shoves them in laundry bags, and then just pulls out clothes to wear.  The audio is what he came in.  Oh, yeah, that one.  It sounds like there's some of these crustaceans on it.  Oh, it's horrid.  It's really bad.  Rick, we're going to have to blow you off because we've got to talk to Kid Rock for a while.  Can I come back?  No.  No.  When are you guys going to be done?  We're done.  Hold back.  You're a liar. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Anything else you want to report real fast?  Just the attack of the cockroaches from her cabinets.  Make sure you get the bathroom, her refrigerator.  I think it's official that Sandy Kane is actually a squatter.  Whoa.  What is that?  What was that?  A friggin' roach.  Look at that friggin' cockroach.  Hold on.  Do you want me to open the boat?  Don't wake you.  Ha!  Ha!  Don't wake you.  Ha!  Don't wake you.  All right.  We've got to go.  We're leaving. 
[00:51:00]  Is it a real cockroach?  Yeah, it's real cockroach.  Moving around and stuff?  We're screaming like women.  You think we're doing it for free?  Nice.  We're out of here.  All right.  We'll get a full report when you get back.  Okay.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  Put a mic down and step on it and put the mic to see how big it was.  Crunching sounds.  You walked into a mess.  Yeah.  I am a mess.  I am the mess.  Kid Rock in studio, Anthony, our special guest today.  I've got to start by just telling you, you kicked ass with that MTV icon with Aerosmith. 
[00:51:30]  Thank you.  Your version of, you did Mama Kin and Last Child, right?  That was unbelievable.  I had to show these kids there was an Aerosmith before MTV.  And you did.  I did have some other tunes besides Janie's Got a Gun.  Hell yeah.  Old school.  Hell yeah.  It's got to be weird singing their songs in front of them, though, right?  Aren't you thinking like...  That was probably the easiest show I've ever done.  It was like high school band practice.  Yeah?  I was like, let's play some Aerosmith tunes.  Yeah.  But they're watching you.  You're like, I hope I'm doing good. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Fine.  Screw it.  Just having fun.  Yeah.  How's everything going with the tour?  Good?  Yeah.  Yeah?  People saying you're kicking ass.  I mean...  Yeah, we're doing good.  That's right.  We're kind of shaking up the industry right now because the record company's not making  any money, but we're making all the money touring.  Good.  It's a great album, Cocky.  Thank you.  Why ain't the record company making money?  Because we're not selling tons of units.  No one's selling tons of records now.  The business is way down.  Everyone pilfering off of the internet? 
[00:52:30]  Is that part of it?  They like to blame it on the kids downloading the stuff for free on the internet.  What do you think?  I don't care.  I'm rich.  What do I care?  Goddamn, that's a good answer.  So you've not been out of shape like Metallica and other bands when they say, hey, man, we're  getting ripped off?  No.  I don't care.  That's great.  That's beautiful.  I can't read them, though.  I don't know if he's telling the truth.  No.  I honestly say.  You really don't care?  I think that's really cool, man. 
[00:53:00]  A lot of people are all bent out of shape.  You know, like, we would have sold more records if it wasn't for the internet.  To see Metallica pitches, like, relax, man.  Those are my boys.  I love Metallica.  No, I know.  But, I mean.  I think it's more Lars.  The other guys are just like Lars.  No, I think the thing is kind of that they got a great deal with their company.  I think they own half their masters or something.  So they kind of got to stand up for what they own.  None of us, you know, little weasels at the bottom, we don't own a jack.  You know, we're just getting pennies from the record company, making money on the road. 
[00:53:30]  Really?  You don't even own your own stuff, right?  No.  I mean, you own a piece of it.  Yeah.  At the end of the day, you really don't know.  God, that's amazing.  So I don't care.  You get a Kid Rock album from, like, 1990, you know, like, you know, the Polyfuse Method.  Do you get any of that money, or is that just such a bad deal back in the day?  No, I actually did make some coin off that, because that record company was an independent  out of New Jersey, actually.  And they went belly up, and they sent me, like, about 4,000 CDs when I got off the label.  So I took them and hocked them at record stores myself.  And I made eight bucks a CD. 
[00:54:00]  Wow, probably more than you make off any other CD, huh?  It doesn't compare to selling $10 million, but at the time, it worked out for you.  I should tell her when Jay Moore's in the studio, too.  Jay Moore!  I defer to Kid Rock, gentlemen.  No, I know, but I'm just, you know, when you're talking, no one knows, you know, it's  you.  Well, sorry if you were confused in your car, and you just put down your one-hitter, and  you're not sure who's talking when.  But, yeah, I'm here, too.  I just can't believe Kid Rock, this is, uh...  You know Jay, man?  You know Jay from...  I do now.  Yeah.  That's so now.  We were in Nam together. 
[00:54:30]  We were in Nam together.  That's right.  You remember, man.  You remember.  I never forget a guy that's sacred for that.  I didn't know Jay Moore.  Jay's doing more sports.  He's just mad on the radio.  Saturday Night Live.  There you go.  He's going way back.  Way back.  Old school.  Now he's on more sports.  That's right.  He doesn't show pretty.  He kicks ass.  Speaking of kicking ass, I'm with the Red Wings last night.  What happened, man?  Oh, boy.  Now we got a problem.  I like it.  There was upsets.  Also, the New Jersey lost, too. 
[00:55:00]  I'm an island level.  Two weird upsets.  I'm an Islander fan.  Huh?  Islanders.  Islander fan over here.  You've got to give it to me.  First time in the playoffs in eight years.  I'm not giving you nothing.  I'm from Detroit.  I understand that.  I know that.  We've got the all-star team.  We can't be losing to Vancouver.  You guys are going to be tough to beat this year.  I hope so.  Because a couple of those are my buddies.  I just want to get a hold of that cup and have a party.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  You don't even think in those terms.  You'll be able to drink out of the cup and stuff.  I drank out of the Islander cup way back when.  Whose cup was it in the locker room? 
[00:55:30]  It's the only cup they've had in the house.  No, no.  When the Islanders were winning in the early 80s, bro.  Really?  Yeah.  Clark Gillies brought the cup to the Huntington Crescent Club.  What were you, 10?  That's what I'm saying.  I didn't get to drink the booze out of it, but I ate his Kool-Aid or something.  That's good, right?  I got a picture with the cup.  Is that all right?  Fondled by Bobby Nystrom.  It might be cooler to drink Kool-Aid out of the cup.  The cup is special if you think about it.  That's pretty pimpy.  When you check out the cup, you know, close up, it is effed up, man.  There's all sorts of dents and scratches. 
[00:56:00]  It looks all nice because they polish it up for the TV, but it's a mess, that thing.  I get all that thing.  Put it on the hood of your car.  I'm going to bronze it and screw everything up.  So we heard you flew into New York just to have lunch.  Is that true?  No.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  It sounded really cool like it's something a rock star gets to do, just fly to New York  for lunch.  I'm going to have lunch.  I'm going to have a burger king or something. 
[00:56:30]  Pull the bus over, man.  Yeah.  All right.  He's not really the full rock star thing.  You're not flying around.  We did go to a pretty floofy restaurant, though.  You did, yeah?  Yeah.  Where?  Cirque.  Ah, look at you.  I don't know those places.  All the big times go there.  That's right.  I don't go there.  We don't make that list.  Big time in New York City.  We go to, like, Fuji for sushi.  We can't even swing the big name places.  We have nothing.  I was such a tool last night. 
[00:57:00]  I went to see...  Took my girlfriend to go see No Doubt down at Roseland, you know?  Yeah, I was at the real show.  I went and jammed with Government Mule.  Yeah, they did.  And everyone said you were unbelievable, by the way.  Thank you.  The feedback's coming in like crazy.  Yeah.  Those guys rock, man.  Like, I'm still at the point.  You know, we got a pretty popular radio show.  Can you explain to Kid Rock so you don't think we're a bunch of fags and you're not really  into No Doubt?  I say...  I took my girl from him, but, you know, I'll sit and listen to the band.  We want someone like Kid Rock to come back to our show.  It's like, look, she's coming back at me and thinks you're like a No Doubt groupie. 
[00:57:30]  My chick likes the music and Gwen's not hard to look at on stage, you know?  She's kind of cute, so it's fine.  And the fans are really hot.  Well, don't look at me like that, Norton.  They do get some smoking hot girls in that audience, though.  The Gwenebys that are about 15 years old.  Great.  Like I said, I was over at the government.  Yeah.  But I don't get any, you know...  I try to work my way into, like, a good section of reserved tables and stuff.  You were rocking. 
[00:58:00]  We got nothing.  I get nothing.  I get nothing.  Play the Hey Baby song.  Come on, play it.  Yeah.  It is funny as hell when you look at the crowd right up front, and there's...  Well, it's gay guys and a lot of young girls.  So that's, you know...  What are you going to do?  When you see this big...  Go to the government mule show.  Are they all over 18, I hope?  See, that's the thing.  No, no, no.  You want to work everything in the audience, and they're all 15 years old. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, you might want to speak to R. Kelly about that.  Yeah.  Make that video.  R. Kelly.  Now we're on the board.  Yeah, now we can talk.  I haven't seen the tape.  Yeah.  No?  We've seen the tape.  I mean, we saw the tape.  I have talked to someone that heard it.  It's...  Or has seen it.  Yeah, we've seen it.  The first two girls, it's really hot.  By the third girl, you're like, oh, God.  You're like, what is he doing?  He's pretty much giving her oral instructions.  That's true.  Like, because she's just got it all wrong.  That's just sick, man.  It was pretty...  He can't be doing that.  Pretty nasty.  You should have taped it, at least.  He can't even... 
[00:59:00]  No.  I just think that's a no-no.  Morals from Kid Rock.  I don't think he's going to do too well in prison, either.  He's...  No.  He's going to be a real celebrity ass in there.  Celebrity ass.  You know, if you're a guy looking at ass all day, he's probably easier on the eyeballs than most of the other inmates.  Oh, man.  I'm saying R. Kelly would probably be like a line.  Oh, God.  That's twisted.  I don't even think about that.  No, that's the ultimate...  And if you're going to have sex with people that are 15 years old, that's what should happen to them.  Yeah.  That's usually what does happen. 
[00:59:30]  Good.  I'm saying that's one great point.  Sal molesters.  Oh, in prison?  No.  I know I killed 15 people, but you've got a problem.  When you see, quickly, back to the no-doubt thing, when you see these, like, big brawny guys, the old tattooed, singing, just looking up at the stage, singing at the top of their lungs,  I'm just a girl, and you're like, what the...  Yes, you are.  What the hell is that about?  At that point, you are.  It's just, I'm just a girl.  And they're singing loud as ever. 
[01:00:00]  Just having a good old...  Having a gay old time.  Did you buy a tour program, did you?  Yeah, there you go.  Bought a little program.  No.  T-shirt.  But I couldn't get...  Yeah, the Gwen t-shirt.  I couldn't get anything.  Like, I don't even rate.  We have kind of a popular show here in New York.  We're syndicated now all over the place.  I go in there, I go to one of the security guys, I'm like, hey, you know, slip me in this part over here, you know.  Whatever.  I'm even ready to throw him some cash or something.  Nothing.  I get squat on nothing.  I am a zero. 
[01:00:30]  You gotta get your face on TV.  You gotta do something.  I don't know what the move is.  You guys, you know, I know Jay'd be in there.  Forget about Kid Rock.  He'd be, you know, the security guy'd be throwing their chicks at him.  I'd be over at the government mule show.  Exactly.  How was that government mule show?  That was good.  Those guys jam.  Government mule.  That's like, you know, Ken of the Allman Brothers, so.  Yeah.  They're unbelievable.  Who was jamming?  The guy from the Crows there jamming and Jason Newstead from Metallica was a good jam.  Wow.  What a party that is.  The Crows broken up now?  Yeah.  Is that official?  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  It's not just a rumor?  What do you listen to, like, on your tour bus when you're driving from city to city?  Like, if you're just going to turn something on and crank it.  What does Kid Rock just say, all right, put this in?  I grab all the CDs out of the truck stops, you know, all those stuff.  He's a Bob CD guy.  Hank Williams, Jr.  George Jones is good drinking music.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like to crank that.  You know, we've been cranking up on air.  People are crashing their cars right now trying to figure out who George Jones is.  Jesus Jones?  Did he just say Jesus Jones?  Right here, right now.  And we all nodded to Kid Rock like, yeah, we know, man. 
[01:01:30]  George Jones.  We're cool like you.  We know George Jones.  I've been listening to a lot of his band.  Yeah?  Oh, really?  So, you know, I know that.  Any hip-hop on the Kid Rock bus?  Any hip-hop?  No, just Uncle Cracker's doing a remake of The Freaks Come Out at Night with Buster Rhymes.  So, he's been playing the hell out of that.  He's working on his new album, so we're hearing that all the time.  Now, what are you hearing about the Black Crows?  What happened?  You can give some inside scoop.  You're inside.  You want to hear what I think happened?  You're in the loop.  Which probably didn't happen.  I think the Kid Rock opinion is what the brothers just finally had it with each other. 
[01:02:00]  No, that dude married the Hollywood chick in Hollywood.  Uh-oh.  You can't have a southern rock band in Hollywood.  Oh.  That's my person.  I mean, Eddie's my boy.  Eddie's from Detroit, the keyboard player.  Yeah.  One of my good, good friends.  I still don't know the story because I'm talking about it.  I'm just making it up.  He's got to be bummed.  He's out of a gig, kind of.  Yeah.  He'll be back with somebody in the hurry.  Those guys are such good players.  They'll get a gig.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to the phones.  Everyone's freaking out that Kid Rock's here today.  Wayne, what's going on, man?  Hey, Bob.  How you doing?  Hey. 
[01:02:30]  Great, man.  Have you ever thought about putting a cover album together to pay respect to all the people  you love?  Yeah, actually, I have.  We just, as a matter of fact, I came up with the Aerosmith, the icon thing we did with those  songs.  Someone said you should do that.  So I'd love to do that.  It's like probably one of the easiest records to make.  Yeah, but you make those songs your own, though.  I mean, a lot of people can't pull it off like you do.  I mean, last night on the MTV icon, unbelievable version of Mama came in the last job.  Thank you.  Steven Tyler, I mean, you did his voice wonderful.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Hey, Bob, I'll see you in Cleveland.  All right, Wayne.  Yeah, it's tough.  Well, man, I've had those guys, you know, when they, you know, it's funny, those guys,  because they're sober and everything, you know?  Yeah.  So every time you're walking with a drink, you know, Tyler's like, let me smell that.  Oh, really?  He tells you, man, I used to love to get high.  I used to get up out of my rehab bed and spin in circles.  You know, but, you know, I've had them out to that.  I got a little suit.  Timber!  I'm getting, we've had them out to the studio when they come through town.  Last time they came through town, Detroit, I went and jammed with them. 
[01:03:30]  They came over to the studio after, and we're back in the woods, and we jammed until about  six in the morning.  Wow.  Those guys still love to play, which is nice to get somebody, you know, who's been around  that long.  Usually people are like, you know, let's do this, let's do that, or something.  They just want to come over and pick up instruments, you know, roadies on the drums,  whatever, and just jammed all night.  Jamming with air as much as you're talking about.  Jamming with air as much as you're talking about.  Yeah.  Now we're going to wing on over to London, jamming with the stones.  Where'd you get this jacket?  The network never told me. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, we could do the whole, I know every line of that movie.  Oh, isn't that great, man?  We sit here for hours on end.  You know, my friend, are a wuss.  Part whip, part pussy.  Hey, Rhett, what'd you get done out of the hamper?  We had a version of that movie, it was just McCauley's line.  That's great.  That's top three.  It was like a 20-minute take, just McCauley.  That's it.  Came over here to help you out with your homework on such a hot date.  Oh, I found your wallet.  Oh, thanks. 
[01:04:30]  That's great.  Yeah.  Hey, Debbie.  Kiss me.  You won't regret it.  Learning about you.  That's the attitude.  That's the attitude.  Sure, you put out the vibes of 8,000 chicks.  That's the attitude.  That's the attitude.  That's the idea.  Damone.  Damone.  Damone rocks.  You wanted it as much as I did.  No, take that back.  All right, I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  All right, earth, wind, and fire, and little brother. 
[01:05:00]  I could really use that $20, Joe.  He'd be taking a phone call to get the abortion for his chick.  Earth, wind, and fire, and little brother.  And little brother.  No one sampled that guy.  Don't poop with it.  His car, you're really keeping it up wonderfully.  I'm telling you, I know that.  Hell yeah, man.  That and Forrest Gump.  I know every line.  Forrest Gump.  That's a great movie, man. 
[01:05:30]  Classic.  That is.  Wind, exchanged to it when I was a kid.  Probably about eighth grade.  It came over from, like, the Netherlands or something.  This girl.  And she's like, what's this high school going to be like?  And I popped that in.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's an accurate depiction.  Guys rolling out of vans, hitting themselves in the head.  I'm so wasted.  Guys pulling their cranks in the bathroom outside the pool.  Don't make movies like that anymore.  No dice. 
[01:06:00]  Doesn't anyone effin' knock anymore?  He had shirts on when he came in here.  No, we didn't, Mom.  Something must have happened to him.  Hey, why don't we jam something from Cocky?  Yes.  Cool.  And then we'll take a little break, and you're going to be around for a little bit, right?  Sure, man.  What do you want to hear?  We're in 18 cities.  We'll play whatever the hell you want.  Well, uh, you never met an M-Effer like me?  You got the clean one?  Uh-oh. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, we do?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll play that.  I think this one's called, you never met a white boy quite like me, because you can't say M-Effer on...  Yeah, on the radio.  They got a problem with the M-Effer.  Yeah, the M-Effer.  The mother part.  It's actually, we're going to do a video for this next.  Cool.  Isn't it weird that you would say M-Effer and not mother-Effer?  I don't remember yet.  M-Effer.  M-Effer.  We all say mother-Effer.  Step, direct it yourself.  Direct it yourself.  I have trouble holding the camcorder still if my son's, like, plays at school.  I'll direct your film. 
[01:07:00]  All right, let's check out some Kid Rock from the Cocky CD.  Stay there.  Kid Rock.  There's just more to life than just you.  Right on.  The latest from Kid Rock off Cocky.  Holy ass, bro.  Family song.  Nice.  I like it.  Hey, we've got to take a quick break, and we'll continue with Kid Rock, all right?  Right.  And we'll take your phone call. 
[01:07:30]  Stay there.  Good evening, ignorant pigs.  Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs, and pay attention.  Well, I'm a virgin.  Hey!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A four-hour parade.  27.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  W-W-W.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Kid Rock in studio, having a lot of fun.  We're telling Kid Rock about Jim Norton here. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, Jimmy, you've enlightened us a bit.  Is it true now that girls kind of don't want you to wear a bag anymore, now that you're so popular on the program and selling out shows all over the country?  The whole years I'm doing comedy, it's always no, and occasionally you get a drunk one, but you've got to wear two rubbers.  And, you know, now you know you're doing good, and all of a sudden you're like, no, you don't have to wear rubber.  They want the Norton Seed.  Leave it in.  Leave your American Express on the table. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, yeah, no, I don't.  I pulled.  I'd just like to hear it.  You mean I could have?  No.  Do you always work on them?  I never.  I don't believe in them.  I'm immune.  No.  He's immune.  No.  Remind me not to walk in your circle.  I always, like, back in the day would assume, you know, wherever she was from meant whether or not she could have AIDS.  I'd be like, oh, you know what?  She's from Minnesota.  How could she possibly have AIDS?  Is that it? 
[01:09:00]  Her father's a dentist.  What could she have?  Jesus, man.  Her father's practically a doctor.  You know she's clean.  She's from Minnesota.  Her father, you know, come on.  What you do is you ask her a question in Creole, and if she understands it, you put a condom on.  You're wrong, man.  We've got to remind everyone, two guys playing Madison Square Garden, May 10th.  Oh, that little room.  Yeah.  That's nice.  God damn.  The rock in the garden.  Who's on the show with you?  I think Lit. 
[01:09:30]  Lit is.  How much time did they do?  Don't do it.  20 minutes.  I don't know.  When they call me, I go onto the stage.  We're going to try to have some guests out for that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess maybe we have a little Hank come up in Tennessee and rock New York City  and maybe Sheryl Crow come out.  You like Jimmy Vaughn?  Sure.  Sure.  We just signed him for more sports.  I don't know.  It's out of the blue.  We just signed him for more sports.  I want to see if he had street cred with the Kid Rock.  Street cred.  We like on the show when we have musical acts, you know, like when you come out of the 
[01:10:00]  gates with like Rock Him and have, you know, you want to have like more of a boutique  mentality.  You had Rock Him on?  That was our first guy, just to make a little statement.  I had no joke.  He used to let the mic smoke.  Right.  Let Rock Him take over.  Well, at the end of more sports, yeah.  There's always a band playing.  So we just, I thought of Jimmy Vaughn and I thought, you know.  He just got that, more sports.  That's right.  Go with the day, sneak up by me, Bobby.  Hippie lettuce, baby, for the glaucoma.  It's just fancy beer they got up here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Sam Adams.  Come on, man. 
[01:10:30]  Help me out for my glaucoma.  Where's the Coors, man?  What are you guys doing?  Well, that's what we drink here on the East Coast.  Yeah, they're big time.  On the East Coast.  We got a bunch of flavors.  Yeah, that's true.  If he wants a Coors, get him a Coors.  Yeah.  You really want Coors?  We'll have it up here in two minutes.  I love Coors.  They gave me a ton of money to sponsor my tour.  And people, oh, anyway, that's right.  Hey, get your Coors flowing.  If people caught selling out, they can suck it, because in reality, it keeps ticket prices  down, so people ain't got to pay 50 bucks to see a show. 
[01:11:00]  It's 30 bucks to come see a two-hour show.  Hey, kid, guess who gave us a load of money?  Sam Adams.  See how that worked?  See how that worked?  They went in Greece.  They're pretty much keeping us on the air.  No one else will advertise with ourselves.  Oh, we love the Sam Adams.  Right.  That's funny, man.  Chris from D.C., what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, man?  How are you?  We're hanging with Kid Rock.  Pimp of the nation.  What's going on, Kid Rock?  Hey, early morning, Stone Pimp.  Outstanding.  Hey, I'm from Saginaw, Michigan, originally.  Been listening to you since about 89.

Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah, I don't know.  Lefty Frizzell, the coach at Georgia State.  No, Lefty Frizzell.  Oh, Frizzell.  You know one of my favorite songs?  What?  Balls in Your Mouth.

Take care.  All right, Chris.  You still get home?  What's that?  Do you still get home?  We only play three days a week.  That's it?  We do like Nashville touring, they call it.  The country guys do.  We play Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Then beat your wife, and then fly home.  That's the country way to...  It's also the shooting schedule for Hee Haw.  You go home, skunks.  I smell skunks.  There's a country song.  He said, we get home to Nashville on a Monday night.

[01:35:00]  I'd make them stank-ass politicians of pain  If I was President  I swear I'd get the job done  You know, I'd uphold the freedom of speech, baby  And our rights to carry guns  I'd give my State of the Union address 
[01:35:30]  From a mile high  Smokin' a joint on Air Force One  You know what I said?  Yeah, one more line again  Break it  If I was President  I wouldn't lie and sneak around  You know what I mean, right?  Yeah  Said if I was President  I wouldn't have sex in the Oval Office  And then lie about it all across town 
[01:36:00]  What would you do instead?  I'd put TV cameras in the Lincoln Bedroom  So the whole nation could come watch  Old Rock laying it down  Speak, speak, speak  Woo!  Yeah!  Kid Rock!

[02:00:30]  Dirty clothes  And pulls it out  The place smelt of  B.O.  And ass  And mothballs  And mothballs  Her bed is a fold out bed  In her one room  Studio  Then  Kid Rock came in  So he had to stop  Doing the Cribs  And this is at the point  Where they went into  The kitchen  And the bathroom  The most heinous area  Horrible timing  Because Rick and Steve  Were screaming  Because there were  Cockroaches  More than one  Dude  I opened one  What is it  Cabinet  Two of them  Bounced off my head  Bounced off your head

[02:05:30]  They were out  On milk crates  On milk crates  Right  But then in her drawer  She had the old  Retired wigs  Right  Inside this drawer  Like wrapped up in a ball  Imagine the mites  And  And the wig hair  Is curled up  Like pubes  On everything  It's scattered  All over the  It's all over the  Apartment  In the clothes  Not you know  Maybe real pubes  And dust  And dirt  Because she refuses to clean  Did you find any  Really disgusting panties  With things in them  They were in the bathtub  But we didn't want to touch it 
[02:06:00]  Yeah  Did you get a shot of it  Yeah  I cannot  This is going to be my favorite  Issue of grips  Lumps of garbage bags  In the corner  Where she puts her dirty clothes  And Rick dove in there  And like pulled out a pair of panties  That had clumped together  Did you wash  Dude  The first thing I did  When I got back  Honestly  The first thing I did  He would wash  Okay  Plus  Plus  When we were going through  Some of her stuff  I actually used  Like a pen  Because I didn't want to touch it  Like the cops  When they pick up evidence  Exactly  That's what I was doing  I was lifting it up  Making sure Steve  Would get a picture 
[02:06:30]  Oh wow  That's great  Yeah  I cannot wait  But the bugs  That just kept coming out of stuff  You move a piece of paper  Boom  There goes another one  Oh my god  Literally  Like you move a mirror  Away from the wall  It's like a scene out of seven  Oh yeah  And seven  And there was no food  No edible food  In the whole thing  Hey hey hey  Someone  I didn't see any edible food  Hold on  Someone's got a line  On what you might have been seeing there  Michael what's up  Michael  Hey man  Hey  Hey what's up Mike  Oh god  That soil  Yeah  That's roach crap

We haven't heard from you  In a while  I was listening to Opie  You inspired me  Because the fight  With Frenchy 
[02:13:00]  Was just before  I had to go do warm up  I got so pumped up  I walked downstairs  I punched a 78 year old woman  Right in the mouth  She probably was asking for it  Well she was blinking  Her and her barren wound  And she probably put up  A bigger fight  Well the thing I liked  About Opie  When he came back  To the mug  He goes  No that was Frenchy bro  Wasn't that Frenchy?  Oh yeah  Good job  It inspired me  I'll tell you  When I took on Rick  I was breathing really bad  But Frenchy was like 
[02:13:30]  Wrestling a veal  Oh man  I hope you grow up  And your womb is barren  That reminds me  I have to have sex  With my wife tonight  Oh my god  So Paul  What have you been up to  Since you were last on our show  I think you were on  What?  Last Thursday?  Last Thursday  Yeah  You had a great time  Yeah it was great  Thanks for the plug  With Rascals  It worked out great  When did you play Rascals?  And you know  I didn't do much  I went out with my  Actually it was an off night  Friday night  Because Regan was out there  So I just went out  To a play with my wife 
[02:14:00]  Oh you did?  Yeah  What play did you go to?  That's cool  Yeah  Anything good?  Yeah it was alright  The Graduate  Yeah that was  Yeah we heard about that play  Yeah she's not a very good actress  What did you think of it?  You know I thought it was okay  I thought Jason Biggs  He hasn't shown range like that  Since American Pie 2  2?  Right  Where they needed a 2  Because there were so many  Unanswered questions  Right exactly  And Paul  Did you get good seats for the play?  Yeah I was actually  I was pretty close  I was like  I don't know  Like 20 rows in the orchestra 
[02:14:30]  20 row orchestra seats?  Yeah  Orchestra seats  And you went that Friday?  Yeah  Wow that's great  Did you see anything unusual  While you were there?  No  No  Nothing at all  How much were the tickets?  I hear that's a hot ticket  The tickets were $45  And then $1.25 surcharge  Surcharge  For the ticket master right?  Yeah the ticket master surcharge  I hate how they do that too  I know it  They're nice guys  They're security  A couple security guys  They're a nice black guy  You met with them? 
[02:15:00]  I just walked by  And said hello  Yeah you had a little conversation  With them  That's cool  Nice guys  Why would you be talking  To security guys  When you're trying to enjoy the play?  Yeah  Oh no I was just  I think you gotta be friendly  To all levels of society  Of course  Of course Paul  We understand  That's great  I hope you enjoyed yourself  So Paul  How did the play end?  You know I had to leave  About 15 minutes in  How many minutes in?  About 15 
[02:15:30]  15?  Yeah  15 minutes  Why?  The wife had a little upset stomach  Yeah so you had a little  Well that's good  Is she pregnant or something?  You know we've been trying  I don't know  But she  I don't know  She had something on her clothes  Or something about her clothes  I don't know  Paul  I gotta say though  Leaving after 15 minutes  That's  You pay 45 bucks  Or 48 bucks  For a ticket  Oh yeah  But I got  I got my money back  Oh you got your money back  Yeah they're good that way 
[02:16:00]  Wow  Most people could never  Get their money back  For leaving a party early  Well I  You know I can be  I can be a pain in the ass  So I just said  You know I  I got an issue here  And I need my money back  Well getting the money back  Is one thing  Did you get the  Ticketmaster surcharge back?  You know I did  Which surprised me  Because I asked for it  And I didn't think  They'd give it to me  I thought you know  They're going to give me  Faith value  But you know  There's such accommodating people  Over at the Plymouth Theater  Right  I recommend you go there  As much as possible  And do what I did  Oh great 
[02:16:30]  See the play for 15 minutes  Leave and get your money back  Right  I mean I thought  That at least prorated  Give me like  You know  42 to 2 back  Charge me 4 bucks  For the 15 minutes  And boy  I gotta  Pay about a minute  And Paul  You know a lot of people  Talking about the graduate  You know Kathleen Turner  She takes her clothes off  Oh did you get to see that?  You know I just  I stepped out  Just before  She took her clothes off  Ah so you didn't see that  No  Damn  But I'm going to go back again  I think  Oh really?  You sound very familiar 
[02:17:00]  To the O&A audience  Today Paul  Really?  Yeah  Well he's been on the show  So many times  Right  Of course  Hang on a second  I gotta just tell my office mate  Something  Put your god damn clothes  Back on  Alright Dave  What the hell  Is your office mate doing?  I don't know  He goes running  And he takes his top off  Manatee for a roommate  You should absolutely then  Tell him  To put his god damn clothes  Back on  I said put your god damn  Clothes back on  No I'm not 
[02:17:30]  That's my right  I can say it  You know something  You are absolutely right  That you can  And I'm glad  That you are saying that  God how long  Are we going to keep this up?  Hey Paul  Yeah  Everyone is freaking out  Yes  Really?  Everyone  Everyone  The lines  Good job Paul  You have balls of steel  I mean they're freaking out  On the phone  Newfound props  For Paul  Paul is a mate  Man  Oh my god  I knew it  I can't stop reading these  Look at this  I don't know what they're talking about  I just enjoyed a short moment  Of time in the play 
[02:18:00]  And then I had to leave  With my lovely wife  Look at Jersey boy  I effing knew it  Oh my god  It was him  Look at  I'm scrolling  Every single one of these  Is about you  Telling your cubicle mate  There at work  To put his god damn clothes on  You know  I just called to say  It was a great show today  I'm proud of you guys  Couldn't be happier  You had Kid Rock in there  Wasn't that great?  Keep up the good work  We will Paul  Thank you

[02:19:00]  I think he did his best  To try to sound like the guy  Well let's listen in here  Alright  Okay  It's on the back  This is rough  Oh my god  You have to wait  Put your god damn clothes back on  Huh  I'd like to say something  Now you know what  That's not  It was a little distorted  Yeah  Because that was one of the mics  That we had  Further away from the perp  That's not too telling  Let's go to another angle here 
[02:19:30]  Another angle  Okay  It's on the back  Kathleen  Put your god damn clothes back on  I get uncomfortable  Just listening to that  Oh I know  It's cringe  You know  I don't think it was him  I don't either  There's differences  Yeah 
[02:20:00]  You know what we should do  We'll pull the tape  Of when he just said  A similar thing  To his little cubicle mate  There at work  And we'll compare the two  And we'll compare the two  Back and forth  About a hundred times  That's a good idea  Yeah  Because I think there are  Differences that show  That it wasn't him  Alright  Why don't we take a break  We can go to the FU line  Sandy Kane's on the line  She wants to talk to us  There's like a hundred people  Around here  Because we're all going  To the Jim Norton show  Tonight  It's Town Hall  Town Hall  A few tickets still available  I don't think so  At this point  But you can try I guess

[02:28:30]  Ben's freaking out.  I have to read a couple of these, Ben.  Sheep Lover, what did I learn today?  Both on should be down.  Jersey Gary, I learned it was neither A, B, or D, nor input 48 today.  It was O and A needed two red lights.  Thanks, Pete.  He also learned last night the place to be was government mule.  Todd from Buffalo, I learned today it's not a mullet, it's a Kentucky neck warmer.  Jerry, I learned that this What Did We Learn represents 30 seconds less radio that O and A needs to worry about.  So, Norton can actually make Jay Moore look like he never plugs. 
[02:29:00]  Yep.  Opie kicks French ass above and below sea level.  And Paul Mercurio is either an impressionist or has really big brass ones.  Heywood from Yonkers, I learned wrestling Frenchy is like wrestling a veal.  Mike from Philly, I learned today Jim is the sexual cancer between Kid Rock and Pam Anderson.  Todd from Buffalo, today I learned that we'll never have to hear Jim Norton April 18th at Town Hall again.  Thank God for that.  Mike D, today I learned that Paul's cubicle mate is Kathleen Turner.  Look at Ben holding up a song that says done with a big exclamation point. 
[02:29:30]  Vinny from Philly, I learned right now Kid Rock is in heaven.  And it goes on and on and on.  Ben having a soluteable Hemelands.  All right.  We'll see you at Town Hall tomorrow.  Some of the gang from the WF stopping in.  And also we'll talk to Santa King.  We couldn't get to her today.  All right.  Peace. </pre>
