<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a furious discussion about the shooting death of a Long Island police officer, focusing their intense anger and using highly offensive language towards the perpetrator, Lamont Pride, and the judge, Evelyn Laporte, who released him.  Numerous callers shared their outrage, some mirroring the hosts' sentiments, while others offered more nuanced perspectives, leading to heated exchanges.  Callers provided details about the officer's life and career, and at least one caller identified himself as a police officer.  After this intensely emotional segment, the show shifted to lighter topics, including a discussion of Louis C.K.'s comedy show and a comedic bit about Mitt Romney.  They also played and mocked a Reverend Al Sharpton blueberry pie commercial.  The segment concluded with the announcement that Rich Voss, Joe DeRosa, and unexpectedly, Louis C.K., would be joining them in studio.

Rich Voss and his wife, Bonnie, then joined the show to discuss their podcast, "My Wife Hates Me."  Clips from the podcast were played, revealing frequent arguments fueled by Rich's suspicions of Bonnie's infidelity, particularly involving a perceived encounter with John Stamos.  The arguments included accusations, insults, and Bonnie's frustration with Rich's insecurity.  The podcast clips also touched upon a broken bedroom door latch, further fueling Rich's suspicions, and Bonnieâ€™s contributions to Rich's work.  The conversation involved rating other female comics' attractiveness, and a listener called in.  Comedian Joe DeRosa, a friend of the Vosses, arrived in studio and joined the discussion, contributing to the analysis of the podcast's content and the couple's dynamic. Bonnie's darkly humorous podcast theme song was played.  The Opie and Anthony hosts interjected with commentary, laughter, and jokes throughout.

Rich Voss and Joe DeRosa remained as guests, continuing the discussion of "My Wife Hates Me," focusing on Rich's insecurities and Bonnie's tendency to exaggerate.  The conversation expanded to include Rich's stand-up career, his new CD "Still Empty Inside," and his podcast's technical difficulties involving calls to tech support from Bob Kelly.  A lengthy humorous discussion about a co-worker, E-Rock, hiding his newly dyed blonde hair ensued.  The conversation also touched upon Louis C.K.'s new direct-to-consumer comedy special and the issues around piracy.  The segment was filled with profanity, sexually suggestive humor, and personal anecdotes.

Joe DeRosa then discussed his independently produced comedy special, "Live at the Beacon," highlighting his cost-saving methods by handling all aspects of production and distribution himself, saving an estimated $100,000.  He contrasted this with the traditional industry model, criticizing Comedy Central's focus on demographics over genuine audience reaction and their editing practices.  He discussed his growing success and financial comfort, his strategy of keeping ticket prices low, the frustrations of dealing with ticketing services, and his experiences with agents and managers.  He shared personal anecdotes about Comedy Central tapings and his divorce. Rich Voss participated, offering comedic interjections and observations.  DeRosa promoted his special, available for $5 online.  The discussion included humorous asides, age jokes, self-deprecating humor, and several off-color jokes and remarks.

Finally, Louis C.K. joined the show, discussing his negative experiences with a record label and manager who cheated him out of earnings. He detailed the challenges of selling comedy through iTunes, fan frustration with finding his content, and the issue of online bootlegging.  He mentioned a recent house fire, dedicated his new special to the late Patrice O'Neal, and shared his feelings about the overwhelming fan support following Patrice's death.  The hosts discussed their podcast's chart position and promoted Louis C.K.'s live show and upcoming appearances. A commercial for Pajamagram aired before the show concluded.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Bah! Morning!  Bah! Morning!  Bah! Morning?  Bah! Hi, everybodies!  How's everyone doing, huh?  They're not going to answer you back.  I was trying to tell you that for years.  I think they're in their cars or in front of their radios at home and just going,  Hi!  Maybe not, huh?  Imagine this is the Twilight Zone and no one's really listening at all. 
[00:00:30]  No one's listening.  It's just all in our minds.  Just useless babble.  Lost a goddamn cop.  That whole situation's...  And we're big fans of the cops.  It doesn't matter if we're NYPD or somewhere else.  Fucking goddamn cop gets shot point blank. 
[00:01:00]  Below his left eye.  Dead a few hours later.  He's a father of four daughters out there on Long Island.  Yep.  Just the Long Island guy.  He's been on the job 22 years.  22?  That means he was close to the retirement thing.  He could have retired at 20.  So he might have been trying to go to 25, right?  No.  He was...  They were saying, you know, he's so into his family and his kids.  And with college coming up for his daughters, he just stayed on the job.  And he had to stay on. 
[00:01:30]  And he was in a shit fucking precinct for that long.  And, you know, time ran out because he's dealing with fucking savages that have no...  Absolutely no regard for human life whatsoever.  So why do we have regard for their lives?  I don't know.  I just don't understand how that works.  I don't know.  I don't want to.  I don't want society to have regard for their lives.  I would like to be able to have these people shot. 
[00:02:00]  But instead, we just let them go.  Even though they committed crimes and they went to court.  And, of course, if you talk to people, our whole judicial system is so racist that it just throws black people in prison willy-nilly.  But this guy, apparently, a murderer, he was up on drug charges.  He has served, like, 16 months on a fucking drug and burglary charge in 2008.  He was arrested in November on Coney Island for a drug charge. 
[00:02:30]  He had already shot somebody in...  North Carolina.  North Carolina.  And he went through the system up here.  And they just let him go.  A drug charge, criminal, past criminal record.  And then you find out he kills somebody or shot somebody.  And there he is on the streets to, again, adhere to no laws regarding guns or human life or anything.  And kills a cop that is so decent that he stayed on a shitty job for two years longer than he had to and probably would have longer to pay for his kids to go to college. 
[00:03:00]  And this fucking animal, Lamont Pride, Lamont fucking Pride, worthless animal, guns him down without any regard.  And what are we supposed to do?  What are we supposed to do?  Oh, well, oh, he probably had a problem with drugs. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, he probably had a horrible upbringing.  Oh, the white man kept him down.  Fuck you.  You'll hear it.  It's such a shame.  Oh, I know.  You'll hear that a lot.  Who is the judge that let this guy go?  Oh, we will find out.  Believe me.  And why does he get to work today?  Yeah.  Why does that guy have to work when if, you know, you make a little mistake doing, well, radio or anything else, you're out of a job.  How about the mistake that got a cop killed because some fucking asshole judge decided this guy wasn't worthy to lock up? 
[00:04:00]  Because a lot of people are questioning that today.  This savage?  This guy shot a guy in North Carolina plus the drug charges like you were talking about.  Yeah.  And for some reason, the judge thought it was acceptable to let him go?  Yeah.  And this guy gets to go to work today?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, why not?  We do a stereotypical Asian fucking voice today.  We could get fired.  Right, right.  You could get fired out there for doing something stupid at your job.  So why is this judge allowed to go to work today? 
[00:04:30]  Should be fucking yanked.  Unbelievable.  And show him the fucking street.  This is the other side.  What the fuck are you doing?  This is the other side of, and this happens all too often, the other side of when, oh, it was police brutality.  It was this or that.  Let's say this guy fired a shot off, right?  Yeah.  It missed that officer.  Right.  I mean, we could only dream that would have happened.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  Impossible because it was point blank.  Right. 
[00:05:00]  Let's just say it did.  And that cop beat the living fuck out of this animal.  Right.  They all would have been talking.  Reverend Al would have been out.  Everyone would have been talking.  What a horrible cop this is.  Oh, look what he did to this poor gentleman who was probably just trying to get money to eat.  Whatever it is, he would have been the villain.  But now, instead, he's dead.  I mean, it's just, that's why I don't want to hear from any fucking criminal dickbag that says they were assaulted or harassed or police brutality. 
[00:05:30]  Fuck you.  You deserve it.  These guys are out there doing a shit job that no one else wants to do.  The precinct this guy was in was an abomination.  And you wouldn't want to be in this guy's shoes for a second.  And if he's out there dealing with these scumbag animals and, you know, one occasionally gets a fist in the face, I'm all for it. 
[00:06:00]  Better than these guys getting shot.  Fucking scumbag.  Travis, what do you got on this?  You came in.  The judge was a female.  Oh, well.  He released him on his own record.  The judge was a black woman.  What race?  Black.  I don't know.  Because usually a black woman.  Evelyn Laporte or Laporte.  I have no idea.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  What up?  Go ahead, Sam.  This is, this is, uh, this is the world we live in.  Go ahead, Sam. 
[00:06:30]  I mean, just look.  I mean, who says that the cop didn't do anything to deserve this?  Shut up, you fucking animal.  Fuck off.  Fuck off.  Fuck off.  Who needs to listen to you?  Fuck off.  Not today.  Not today.  Not today.  Not today.  You know what?  I'm, you know the restraint I'm having not blurting that word out that you are?  That word you are!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  That cop did nothing.  He was raising a family.  Look into it, asshole. 
[00:07:00]  He was raising a family.  Look into it.  Look into raising a family.  Not just spreading your seed around, you fucking animal.  Shut up!  Yeah, you shut up.  Die.  Die.  Yeah, yeah.  Go ahead.  Go commit a crime.  I hope you're on the losing end.  I hope you're on the losing end of a fucking cop's gun.  Hope you're on the losing end of a cop's gun, you animal.  Shut up!  How do you say that?  How do you even say, maybe the cop did something wrong?  Shut up!  Shut up! 
[00:07:30]  Ah, get back there.  Stole the radio, you listening on, you fucking prick.  Yeah, whatever.  He put his hand on the wrong one.  That's right.  The wrong one?  What's the right one?  What's the right one?  The right one is going to go too big.  Oh, yes sir, Mr. Officer.  Yes sir, Mr. Officer.  They were robbing a place.  Hey.  Hey, they were robbing.  They were robbing a place.  The cops went into a robbery in progress.  So what happened?  They were doing their job.  Boy, your mama would scream for the police.  If somebody was running into your mama's house, she'd scream for the cops. 
[00:08:00]  If she ain't got a gun to go to the ass the way she should get got.  That's the life I live.  What?  What life you live, yo?  What's the thug life you live?  That she should have.  Assimilate to a civilized society, you fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  Fuck off.  Fuck off.  That cop was worth 20 of you fucking thugs.  Shut up, bastard.  You fucking bastard.  Your mama did a great job of raising you, you fucking dirtbag. 
[00:08:30]  Go impregnate 12 more women.  Shut up.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  Odds are you're probably going to get shot, so enjoy your time.  Hey, look at the stats.  You're probably going to get shot.  Enjoy your time while you have it.  Enjoy your time.  Male, black, uh, age that just either ends up in prison or shot.  Enjoy yourself.  Enjoy yourself.  Enjoy yourself.  Hey, a better day today.  I know the motherfucker to put his hands on a gangster die.  Yeah, you're a gangster.  Yeah, go ahead. 
[00:09:00]  One of your fucking homies will shoot you, or hopefully a cop will shoot you.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Good job.  Good job.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I bet you yell for the cops when your drug money gets stolen.  Oh, I bet when some homeboy runs into your fucking apartment,  and holds you up.  Oh, where are the police?  Where are the police at?  Where are the police at?  Shut up, you fucking animal.  Die.  Die.  Get shot.  Right.  Get shot.  Where you belong. 
[00:09:30]  Get shot.  Get shot by white, black, and mixed.  Whatever.  Get shot.  Get shot, home.  Get shot, homeboy.  Get shot, homie.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Good luck.  I'm not even going to fucking entertain this guy anymore.  Enough.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  God bless you.  Shut up.  Shut up.  What a fucking asshole.  We got Jay in fucking Cleveland.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, ass man.  First of all, I like to say I'm sorry for niggas like that. 
[00:10:00]  That's what makes us look fucking bad.  I'm out here humping my ass 24-7 in this truck.  I listen to you.  I don't stand up for all your views, but for a cop who gets shot, that's fucking wrong.  Cop gets shot responding, and some fucking animal like that's got to call up and blame  it on the cop is ridiculous.  Fucking ridiculous.  I got family who's police officers, and they're also in the military, and the last thing I  want them to go out and do is run into a robbery in progress and get shot because some 
[00:10:30]  dumbass niggas have to run around with a gun and just fucking tense up and go back  out in the street.  Guy's raising a family, fucking just trying to live the dream.  He's trying to send his four girls to college, and this fucking nothing, this speck of shit  takes him out like that.  And this judge now, look at this, it's all, why isn't the fucking blatant racism apparent  here?  This black woman judge, this maternalistic fucking piece of shit that looked at this fucking 
[00:11:00]  prick and fucking let him go, is, how the fuck can she sleep either?  How can she sleep?  This fucking useless judge piece of shit.  What's her fuck name?  What's her name?  Because please, look her up, see what her address is, her fucking, uh, write her letters,  write to the fucking whoever, whoever her bosses are, and just get her fucking thrown out.  There's an opportunity where someone has a job and should be fired. 
[00:11:30]  I'm not one that, that blurts out that people should be fired.  She should be fucking fired.  Not for saying something, for doing, for not doing something.  Uh, Evelyn Laporte.  Hey, I'm 100% with you.  We should do something.  I'm, I'm sick of, especially within my own community.  Yeah, you, you got it bad.  Bill Cosby and Obama at one point in time said it, that we need to start looking at 
[00:12:00]  ourselves and not blaming other people.  I'm fucking sick of it going, oh, it's a white man, but every time I hear that, I want  to kick someone's fucking teeth in.  Not enough people are saying that.  You, you got it, you got it really bad, man.  I feel bad for you, because you got it fucking bad.  Uh, uh, with, with this, this is running rampant and no one wants to agree with it.  They, well, uh, there are plenty of good people.  Sure there are, but there's too many bad people in the black community. 
[00:12:30]  I mean, it's gotta be dealt with.  The stats are fucking outlandish.  It's crazy.  And it makes, it makes it tougher for you to live your life like a fucking productive,  uh, uh, member of society.  I'm, I'm, I'm 34 years old and, um, I grew up in Cleveland and I grew up in the  suburbs, but I got looked at at other blacks as being a sellout because of what I listened  to or how I acted.  Like, oh, you listen to, you fucking listen to James Addiction? 
[00:13:00]  What the fuck is that shit?  Like, man, fuck you, you don't even know what the fuck is going on.  See, he wasn't in the hip hop society.  No.  He wasn't in the hip hop world.  All right.  Hey, listen.  All right, thanks, man.  Thank you, Jay.  Uh, this stuff just gets me wound up.  Let's go to Dave in New York City.  Dave, what's up?  Hate it.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Uh, let's see how quickly, uh, Reverend Al comes out to defend this cop.  I feel so badly for his family right before Christmas.  Ugh. 
[00:13:30]  You can't even imagine.  Well, no one can imagine how awful that would be.  I, I do believe that, uh, Reverend Al should make some kind of statement, but he's-  I'm eating the pie!  But he's too busy trying not to eat the pie.  Well, I, I'm lying.  I'm eating the pie.  Now that he's lost a little weight, he's trying so hard not to eat the blueberry pie.  Hey, guys, why don't we, why don't we tweet Reverend-  I'm eating my kids.  Yeah.  I'm eating my kids.  What do you want, a cookie?  Why don't we, uh, tweet Reverend Al today and ask if he's going to make a statement about  this.  Make a statement. 
[00:14:00]  This certainly is in his wheelhouse, isn't it?  It's an incompetent judge, an incompetent, perhaps, let's look at a record, perhaps racist  judge, but, but incompetent, uh, judge that let this, uh, uh, scumbag go when she absolutely  could have kept him behind bars based on his past record or shipped his ass to where  he was shooting at other people.  And, uh, what the fuck?  Hey, let's get some answers.  Get her taken off the bench. 
[00:14:30]  Piece of shit.  Right before Christmas, too.  Yeah, that's, that's fucking, the picture in the paper of the four, uh, uh, three of the  girls just, uh, devastated fucking outside the hospital.  Uh, this, this has to fucking stop.  Uh, let me say hi to Mike Copping Jersey.  Mike, what's up, buddy?  How you doing, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Tough day for a lot of you guys.  Well, just listen, he's on the way in, just to make my blood boil. 
[00:15:00]  Ugh.  When another brother officer dies because of a judge's oversight, our judges are immune  to liability.  They don't have to, they're not liable for anything they do.  And on top of that, this poor guy who was working when he should have been retired, his  wife's who worked 25 years to get 60% of his pension.  Yeah.  If he's just, he'll work one day and get 100%, they're done.  Jesus Christ.  That makes no sense at all.  She fucked up.  It's very obvious.  And a lot of people are pointing the finger at this, uh, this lady today, but nothing will  happen. 
[00:15:30]  Like you're saying, no, no fucked up.  The guy, the guy shot someone in North Carolina.  Why would she let him go?  Fuck the North Carolina thing even.  Take that off the table.  And that's real serious.  Well, that's a, that's a big one though.  It's huge.  Yeah.  And then he got the other, the other drug, uh, drug, uh, um.  Drug charges.  Why?  Why, because of his past record, did she just let him go, uh, with, without holding  him or at least making a post or something like this fucking, because I'll tell you one  thing and I've seen this before and this is my, my theory. 
[00:16:00]  Hold me responsible.  Ooh, look out.  I believe female black judges have this maternalistic attitude towards, uh, male, young male black  criminals.  I think they go before them and they get this nurturing.  I'm going to help you and not punish you.  Bullshit thing that goes on instead of dealing out justice.  And I think, uh, uh, that's what my opinion is.  That's what we see with this woman.  And, uh, I'd like to look at her past and, and see, see what she's done in the past. 
[00:16:30]  Uh, how many people she's, uh, let off the hook.  And you're a hundred percent right.  A lot of the judges in the cities, that's all they do.  Right.  They're just going to help everybody out and just let everybody go.  And this is, yeah, this mothering fucking attitude.  You're not, you're not a mother.  You fucking asshole.  You're a judge.  Do your job.  Don't fucking, you're not coddling these fucking animals.  Ugh.  Oh, I'm just a hundred percent on the money.  Today, I got to run because I'm on my way into my shithole district now doing what I got to do. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, God.  All right, bro.  Shoot first.  All right, thanks a lot.  Shoot first.  Uh, John, a cop from North Carolina.  The judge should be charged with accessory to murder.  Yeah.  Why not?  That's, John, you know that's just not going to happen, obviously, right?  No, of course.  Oh, no shit.  They, they can do whatever they want and get away with it.  And fuck our, geez, call them reverend.  There's nothing religious about this, man.  Uh, maybe, maybe they ought to start a new Occupy.  Maybe we ought to occupy our courthouses since they're supposed to be for the people. 
[00:17:30]  And fuck these judges, they're appointed.  Oh, what did he get?  A $2.5,000, two and a half, $2,500 bail?  Oh, boy.  Is that what he got?  And what is that?  He's got to pay 10% cash, $250?  He got to sell weed for an hour and pay the bail.  Oh, please.  Of course.  All right, listen.  I got to go to Dale in South Carolina.  Dale.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Good morning.  I listen to your show.  I am truly a big fan of your show.  Y'all guys have me rolling every morning. 
[00:18:00]  And I can tell you kind of hate it this morning, as you should be, because of the situation.  And I feel almost the same way you feel.  I mean, there's no need for that when you call someone that's supposedly to help you,  and then you wind up being on the other side of the gun.  That's crazy.  But I think sometimes whenever we let our emotions roll a little bit,  we start bringing in stuff into the situation that shouldn't even be there.  You know, pointing out that this was a white cop, and this, of course, was a black guy that did it.  I mean, if you look back within, even from where I'm from, South Carolina, 
[00:18:30]  with the strong sermon and all that other kind of stuff, man,  if you want to take it back to that far, you know, the things that white folk did to black people was just typical, man.  All right.  Even somebody I wasn't even aware of.  Not tying it to the situation, but, I mean, I feel the same way you do.  Look, there's â€“ I hear what you're saying.  I just got to say something.  Like, everybody that's come here has come to this country with some type of adversity.  And I'm not underplaying what blacks went through. 
[00:19:00]  It was the worst shit that went on with anybody that came to this country, I think.  The Irish had it bad.  The Asians had it very bad when they came here.  But â€“  Not compared to African Americans.  I'm saying that.  I'm saying that.  Get a drug out of your home.  Trust me and bomb.  But â€“  I understand.  Adversity â€“  Normally, when you look at adversity in cultures, it kind of builds some fucking character.  This shit has been going on too long. 
[00:19:30]  And when you have a black man in the White House, I honestly think â€“  That has nothing to do with â€“  No, no.  Look, look, look.  Let me finish.  You didn't let me finish my point.  I said when you have a black man in the White House, I feel we've reached a point where there isn't as much adversity towards black people that there was when it was impossible to even imagine a black man in the White House.  Yet the crime continues and the fucking â€“ the lack of civility and family and just acting in a civilized society, it just continues at a rate that is far disproportional to any other racial background in this country. 
[00:20:00]  Well, I think a lot of that too.  I mean, that is the truth.  I mean, that's just it.  But a lot of times too, things just get swept under the rug when it's the opposite side of the race.  I mean, like most white people are being stereotyped as being white guys anyway, as being child molesters and all telephiles and stuff like that. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, yeah.  And I â€“ yeah, yeah, that's the way it's â€“ that's the way it's â€“ it's kind of stereotyped.  Because most of the people committing pedophilia and crimes against children are white males.  It's â€“ you're able to profile things.  And most people â€“ what?  Yes?  I said, but when I â€“ when I â€“ when the cases just come up like that, you read them in the paper before you see them.  I don't just naturally assume that that's â€“ that's what it is. 
[00:21:00]  I would.  Because the stereotype proved to be different, man.  But like I said, I mean, I blow off a little bit of steam too, just like when Rodney King got that royal ass whipping that he got.  Yeah.  And I just wonder how people felt about that, you know what I'm saying, when you saw a defenseless guy getting the shit beat out of him by four cops.  Well, you know what?  That's been â€“ that's â€“  That's when everything changes and then they go, oh, yeah.  That's been countered as far as him being a defenseless guy.  And I think â€“ I think he's proven over the years what a piece of shit he is. 
[00:21:30]  I think so.  You're right.  And so it just goes back to shit.  It's just almost like if you â€“ we want justice to work sometimes.  But in other times, we don't want it to work.  I mean, I â€“ the same way that you feel now that that cop is gone and I feel the same way you feel.  So, you know, there was someone that was grieving because there's been an accident in a shooting where this 16-year-old got shot and this 18-year-old got shot. 
[00:22:00]  Well, then don't have fucking illegal guns.  Then stay away from illegal guns and drugs and gangs.  Illegal guns.  Come on, man.  That's Arizona.  Everybody in Arizona is packing in.  Ninety percent of them are white guys.  Come on, man.  You can't just sit there and just â€“ see, that's the problem that I have.  A lot of times when you're trying to have a straightforward conversation with somebody, when you start talking about other stuff that's irrelevant, you kind of get away from the top.  I listen to you.  I'm on your side.  Yeah, but you're telling â€“ 
[00:22:30]  I think that people just â€“ listen, man.  Are you telling me that guns â€“ wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You've been talking for a while.  You're telling me that guns in the hands of white people that are legal gun owners are more dangerous than in the hands of illegally owned black people?  What?  Is that what you just â€“ is that what you just told me?  No, listen to what I'm saying.  What'd you tell me?  It's not so much as a problem to â€“ okay, you got â€“ let's just say 90 percent of white guys are on the gun in Arizona. 
[00:23:00]  I'm quite sure you have bar shooters or whatever, whatever.  You don't tend to hear about them a lot of times because it's not really an issue.  You know what I'm saying?  But as soon as one black person shoots somebody with a gun, whether it's legally done or justified, then that's when the irrelevant stuff starts to come in.  I mean, people get shot every day, and it is a proportion â€“ I mean, it's a proportionate amount of more blacks, I think.  It's mostly black on black. 
[00:23:30]  It's mostly black on black.  I can agree with that.  It's mostly black on black shootings.  As you can probably listen and tell, I don't take the racism stuff very, very seriously.  If I did, I wouldn't listen to the show.  I mean, it cracks me up.  I don't feel bad about who I am because, you know â€“  I think we're going to have to agree to disagree, sir, because â€“  We can agree to disagree.  We got a lot of calls lined up here.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Dale in South Carolina.  A couple things people want to know if you'd feel the same way if it was a white judge.  I can answer for Anthony. 
[00:24:00]  He absolutely would be this outraged.  I would absolutely be calling for that.  And also, we'll just make sure it's all out there.  And if it was a black cop that was shot, you would be outraged as well.  Oh, yeah.  It's the same fucking thing.  You absolutely would be.  You know â€“  Because people are really trying to, like, pin you on the whole race issue here.  They always do.  But if it's a black cop who's been on the job 22 years trying to raise his fucking family  and some thug shoots him, I don't give a shit what color he is.  People don't even get me. 
[00:24:30]  They really don't understand that I truly am basing my opinion of people on the content  of their character and not the color of their skin, motherfucker.  And when I call people out because the content of their character sucks and they happen to  be black, I'm a racist?  Fuck your mother.  And the judge, by the way, is half black, half Puerto Rican.  Yeah, great.  And she's well-spoken.  And we have a video profiling how well-spoken she is.  What?  Oh, yeah.  You want to hear?  I would like to hear. 
[00:25:00]  This is what the judge said, let this animal go.  All right.  Here she is.  It's â€“ what's her name again?  Judge Evelyn Laporte.  Laporte.  Makes tough trip to the top.  Ah.  Long way from the small Puerto Rican village she grew up in.  Oh, boy.  My father was a sugar cane field worker for all his life.  Stop.  My mother used to work with â€“ as a domestic person working for middle class and rich people  in Puerto Rico.  Sleeping.  Cleaning and cooking.  When she turned 20, Laporte moved to New York City to learn English and try to land her 
[00:25:30]  dream job.  All right.  I first wanted to be an airline stewardess.  I was fascinated with the uniform and what the airplanes and everything.  Well, she would have.  So that was my first choice.  She spoke no English, and when she couldn't get hired by the airlines, she went to community  college.  She worked full time to pay for school and send money home.  It took her three colleges and ten years to get her degree.  I have to adjust to the weather.  I have to adjust to a different neighborhood.  I have to read the language, and it was not easy. 
[00:26:00]  Many times I thought about giving up.  I'll give her some â€“ I'll give her the fact that she's got gumption.  But she didn't.  She went on to get her master's at John Jay College, pursuing her second career choice.  Law.  The master's degree, I was supposed to complete it in two years.  So two and a half.  I completed in one and a half years.  That's a worthless piece of paper at this point.  Yeah, it was such a great feeling.  She went to law school in Washington, finishing a semester early.  When I returned to New York to seek employment, I was a little scared because of the competition, 
[00:26:30]  and you know how New York City is.  Yeah.  So I said, even if I have to start from the bottom, I'm willing to do that, and that's exactly  what I did.  At one point, she worked five jobs to pay back her loans and pay for medical care for  her parents.  That's impossible.  Eventually, she became an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, working on domestic violence  cases.  When she was in the domestic violence people, I mean, every victim was like her sister.  Oh, boy.  And, you know, that's a great thing for a prosecutor.  It's a great, great, great thing.  Two years ago, Laporte was elected a judge in Brooklyn. 
[00:27:00]  Her first posting was here at Manhattan Criminal Court, a job she says brought with it a whole new  set of challenges.  When I was a prosecutor, I was a prosecutor.  When, if I was defense counsel, I was defense counsel.  Now I'm neither.  So I have to interpret and evaluate what is in front of me, be just, and at the same time,  make sure that I keep my community safe.  You know, I think the people of the city.  Oh, good job.  Oh, look.  Good job.  Keep the community safe.  By letting this guy go. 
[00:27:30]  He was right in front of you.  You let him go.  Look, I'll give it to her.  She, that sounds great.  She worked hard, learned English, came up, got herself a job.  How are you going to knock her on that?  It's a, it's a, a glowing commentary on how you come to this country and make something  yourself.  But you know what?  She's horrible at her job.  She did her job very poorly.  She's terrible at her job.  She fucked up.  She fucked up.  She fucked up.  Yeah.  You know what she said about that?  I didn't do shit. 
[00:28:00]  I didn't do shit.  Is there more to this clip or is that it?  It's him.  It's this guy crowing about her, I guess.  Well, this guy crowing about her should be fired too.  You don't.  You have somebody like that who, you know, had a life that was not an easy life and yet  reacts to people with such compassion.  She also may be the most stylish judge on the bench.  Oh, well, that's the most important thing.  Solana Pine, New York won.  That's the important thing.  Style.  Style.  Style. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, look, you know, hey, she did a great job.  She did everything that an immigrant is, I guess, supposed to do with it at this point,  even though Puerto Rico, you're allowed to just kind of hang on up.  It's not really an immigrant, but, uh, but, uh, you know, we got Chicago checking in.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Tommy.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Tommy.  Hello?  Hey, you're on the air.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Tommy, can you hear me?  Yep.  All right, what's up, Tommy? 
[00:29:00]  Um, so this cop that got shot and the first caller that you said, that stupid guy, said  that, you know, maybe the cop did something wrong.  This guy was a highly decorated NYPD officer, had over 200 arrests in his career, and actually  had, uh, 12 medals, one of which was an outstanding merit award for actually getting in a,  uh, shootout with the, uh, Zodiac killer.  Oh, shit.  Damn, really?  All that, and, uh.  So to say that he may have done something wrong, I, I just, I can't buy it.  That's an insult, that fucking guy, uh, even, even saying that shit.  It's, it's, it's an ignorant fucking asshole. 
[00:29:30]  That's the world, uh, that guy lives in.  Living the thug life.  Well, that's the world.  Cops fault.  That's, yeah, he lives in a world where he has blinders on.  He's never going to see it the other way.  Never.  Well.  Right.  Maybe he'll get, uh.  Thanks for the info, Tommy.  Maybe he'll have a moment when he's bleeding out on a street somewhere because some fucking,  uh, you know, homie put a bullet in him or a cop while he was robbing a place.  So.  Oh, God.  Ew.  Gee.  Thoughts go out to, uh, that officer's family.  Oh, it's terrible. 
[00:30:00]  I guess, uh, there's, there's, uh, various charities and whatnot for the, for the family  because, I mean, around Christmas time.  Oh, Jesus.  It's going to be fucking horrible.  Um, yeah.  All right.  It's crazy.  Well, I guess we'll give out any info that we can get as far as charities go.  Legit ones, not fucking shysters.  So Reverend Al certainly won't, uh, speak up on this, right?  Reverend Al.  Huh?  Reverend Al.  He'll keep his stupid mouth shut.  Cause they was the ones eat the pie. 
[00:30:30]  Reverend Al had a, bring that up on his show yesterday.  Did he?  As much as I hate this fucking guy, I end up watching him every day.  Ugh.  And it's one of these situations where I watched to get mad, I guess.  Yeah.  And I also watched cause I'm trying to figure out why they would have ever given him a show  on MSNBC.  He has no charisma.  I mean, in the end, it is TV where you got to entertain.  He sucks.  No, he's terrible.  He's just always bitter.  He scowls the whole fucking time. 
[00:31:00]  It's really tough for him to smile.  I don't think those muscles in his face work.  Cause when he does smile, it's like that creepy, like, yeah, I'm a jack-o'-lantern.  He doesn't look comfy doing it.  So I guess SNL, um, made fun of the blueberry pie commercial that we've been making fun  of.  Yeah.  Uh, we got the blueberry pie commercial for a reference point for the people that might  not have heard this yet.  If we can find that really fast.  And then SNL, uh, did their take on it.  And then Reverend Al had to play it on his show yesterday to show that he has a sense 
[00:31:30]  of humor.  I got the sense of humor.  But the whole time you could tell he doesn't have a sense of humor and that someone behind  the scenes said, look, if you're going to be on TV, you're going to have to fucking  lighten up and, uh, see that this is funny.  Yeah.  You'll see what I mean in a second, but we got to go with the, uh, the blueberry pie commercial  first.  The blueberry pie.  This fucking dope.  Reverend Al Sharpton's blueberry pie commercial.  Yeah.  You know, I grew up here in Brooklyn and we used to come home from school. 
[00:32:00]  My mother, some of the ladies in the neighborhood would make blueberry pie and we would rush in  knowing our mothers were still working and we'd eat.  This don't look right.  Did y'all eat the pie?  No.  And blueberry be all over our face.  That's what happens when I look at the GOP.  They talk about the economy's bad and we didn't do it.  We were the ones fighting, but they got the blueberry pie all over their face.  They were the ones eating the pie.  They were the ones eating the pie.  They were the ones eating the pie.  Who thought that was a good idea? 
[00:32:30]  They were the ones eating the pie.  It's a standalone pie.  It's not like a pie with other pie.  He looks like a dope.  So SNL made fun of it.  And then this is what Reverend Al did with the whole thing yesterday.  Listen to how uncomfortable this is.  They went after my blueberry pie.  When I was little, we would play catch the Nazi in the backyard.  We put a blueberry pie in a box and the Nazi would come around and try to get it. 
[00:33:00]  Isn't that like what the Republicans are trying to do, steal our pie?  I'm not sure what.  I need a straight answer.  Kelly, are Republicans and Nazis trying to blueberry steal pie out the box?  We're big fans of Saturday Night Live, and no doubt they got me pretty good.  Now, some people on our Facebook page thought it was a little rough, but I thought it was hilarious.  We love a good joke.  That shit's hilarious.  We love a good joke.  We love a good joke. 
[00:33:30]  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  Nappy-headed hoe.  That was a good joke.  I love a good joke.  Like, let's say a girl named Tawana Brawley.  We make it like she was raped and shit on by white people.  And a racial epithet was scratched in her.  And she was placed in a bag and put on the side of the road.  And then we blame Stephen Pagonis for it.  And we blame everyone.  And Maddox and Mason, the lawyers, they come out, 
[00:34:00]  and they start blaming police officers in a giant conspiracy.  When all the time, and here's the joke, it was all made up.  No one really did it.  She did it to herself.  Oh, yeah.  She rubbed shit on herself and scratched the racial epithet in herself herself.  She the one spreading the shit.  I love the good joke. 
[00:34:30]  Like the Internal Revenue Service.  Now, that's hilarious.  They want money like a piece of pie.  But I want to keep all the pies.  And they the ones that say they want the pie.  And now they after me.  And I might get pie in what they call the federal penitentiary.  That shit hilarious.  Oh, Reverend Al.  He likes a good joke, though. 
[00:35:00]  He loves a good joke.  I mean, that was a Nazi joke.  It was?  I guess you're okay with Nazi jokes there, Reverend Al.  Who don't love a good Nazi joke?  You're okay with that, but you're not okay with nappy-headed hoe jokes, I guess.  That's weird.  That's over the line.  That's kind of weird, isn't it, Ed?  Over the line.  If you're not into nappy-headed hoe jokes, you shouldn't be into Nazi jokes.  That's what I'm thinking today.  Fucking Reverend Al.  The only time Mr. Imus fucking let the world down.  I know.  I'm sorry I did that. 
[00:35:30]  You should have fought this idiot.  I shouldn't have done that.  I'm sorry I did that.  You should have fucking fought.  Ah, that's a good point.  This guy's a joke.  What?  How about nappy-headed Nazis?  Yeah, exactly.  I get away with that because Reverend Al made fun of them.  You jerk.  If you're going to have a huge problem with nappy-headed hoe, then you shouldn't be laughing  at Nazi jokes, Reverend Al.  Oh, no.  Insensitive.  It continues.  But I thought it was hilarious.  We love a good joke.  Yeah.  And they're right.  I'm not a big fan of teleprompters. 
[00:36:00]  And there's a lot of red lights out there.  And let me say to Kenan, if you're going to do me, you've got to lose a little weight.  Leave the blueberry pie alone.  But my goal to the show is to point out what's really going on in America and fight for fairness  and justice.  Yeah.  And have a little fun doing it.  A little fun.  Like my hilarious bit during the Crown Heights riots.  You remember this one?  That's right.  Do you remember me saying, if the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin back their yarmulkes 
[00:36:30]  and come over to my house.  That shit's hilarious.  I said that, by the way, really.  Pin the yarmulkes back.  I'm a regular Eddie Murphy, motherfucker.  Then there was a stabbing and a killing and everything.  But, you know, whatever.  I'm on MSNBC now talking about the bum-dating the pie. 
[00:37:00]  It's hilarious.  I love the good joke.  I love a good joke.  I can't remember it.  But I know it's, put Velcro on the ceiling.  I know it ends like that.  The warden.  I know that one, too.  That's a good one.  Let me see.  Two if you slice them thin enough.  Now, that's hilarious. 
[00:37:30]  Why he's trying to steal all them chains.  That shit's hilarious.  Yeah.  That shit's hilarious.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, it feels good to laugh.  Ah!  Hey, where are the white women at?  Yeah.  Whoever now sucks. 
[00:38:00]  Ah, hell.  What an asshole.  And remember when I was at King College in 1994, one of my favorite bits ever, white folks  was in caves while we was building empires.  We taught philosophy and astrology and mathematics before Socrates and them Greek homos ever got around to it.  Ah, shit, motherfucker.  Ah, that's hilarious. 
[00:38:30]  I love a good joke.  I love a good joke.  I meant homo sapiens.  I just said homos for short.  I am a scream.  What a hoot.  He said he likes a good joke.  Love a good joke.  He likes a good joke.  Love a good joke.  Around here, we like a good joke.  Yeah.  Fuck, dude.  That's funny, man. 
[00:39:00]  That's some funny-ass shit.  Yeah, the parrot can stay, but he's got to leave.  I love a good joke.  We serve everybody.  All right.  We're going to break early today.  That's what we do.  Reverend Al got to eat.  Yep.  We're going to eat.  Yeah.  We got Rich Voss coming in today, and I got some great audio from his podcast.  Yeah, apparently.  A huge blowout he had with his wife, Bonnie. 
[00:39:30]  I couldn't believe they left it on their podcast, and we got the audio today.  We're going to play that when Rich gets here.  Also, Joe DeRosa.  And Louis C.K. called late yesterday afternoon, said he wants to stop by and say hi.  Oh, that's cool.  That's awesome.  I saw his Beacon show.  All right.  You were able to download it.  I was there live.  I know.  And I saw it on my telly.  Good, right?  And holy fuck.  More than good.  Hilarious.  That motherfucker is just funny.  Every year, he's pumping out a whole new hour of comedy. 
[00:40:00]  It's unbelievable.  Maybe I can open for him.  Did he do the Jew thing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Where the Jews are trying to out-Jew each other?  Fucking brilliant.  He's fucking funny as fuck, man.  Yeah, so he's coming in to say hi.  Very good.  Probably talk about the Beacon Theater thing a little bit.  Yeah.  Because, man, this is going to change things, I think.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I think you're going to see just about every comic that you know and love following Louis  Lee.  He's an innovator, that Louis. 
[00:40:30]  It's brilliant.  For five fucking dollars, you get to download the show from the Beacon Theater?  Fucking cool as shit, right?  And he really is begging people not to do that Torrance thing with his shit.  Yeah.  I mean, for five bucks, it's so cheap.  It's just, it's worth it not to just go through the fucking hassle of-  And he makes a good point.  He's like, look, if you guys don't, you know, pirate this shit and do the right thing, it's  only five dollars.  He even says, it's only five lousy dollars, then I'll be able to do more of this. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  You're only going to hurt yourselves.  Yep.  Because this is a great business model if everyone does the right thing, you know?  Yeah.  If shit's like fucking fifty dollars, a hundred bucks, we're like, fuck you.  Oh, fuck you.  Steal that shit.  Fuck you.  Steal that shit.  You're right.  Yeah, but five bucks.  But if you know the artist is doing the right thing and keeping the cost down, then you have  to do the right thing.  Yeah.  It's five lousy dollars.  Five dollars.  Me a bag of shells. 
[00:41:30]  But you're right.  If they're getting fucking greedy, you steal that shit.  And it's all bets are off.  I steal shit all the time if it's too expensive.  Fuck yeah, that's how the world works.  Yeah.  But, you know, Louie's doing the right thing, so don't do that shit.  He'll explain more when he gets in, I'm sure.  I got another one.  Oh, you do?  About Mitt Romney.  Good old Mitt Romney.  This is my Romney bit.  Okay.  I'm still working on it.  I put a little pad on a stool next to me when I do this one. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, you're an alternative comic.  To look like a hip alt comic.  But I'm hilarious.  As for the one Mormon running for office, those who really believe in God will defeat him  anyways.  So don't worry about that.  That's a temporary situation.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  And I'm out.  He's going after the Mormon religion?  I threw the mic on the floor like Eddie Murphy. 
[00:42:30]  He's going after the Mormon religion?  Seriously?  Yeah, he said something like that.  And he has a problem with nappy-headed hoe?  Yeah.  That's way fucking worse going after someone's religion.  Those who really believe in God, he's implying the Mormons don't believe in God.  Right.  No matter how wacky their religion may be, it's no more wacky than any other religion.  They got Joe Smith.  And we got zombie Jesus.  We got zombie Jesus.  We got fucking the walking dead.  We got zombie Jesus.  I think that's why we might have the coolest religion.  Really? 
[00:43:00]  Any other religion has a zombie?  I don't think so.  And zombies are hot right now.  Zombies?  Very, very hot right now.  Yes.  We had zombie fucking Jesus walking around.  Zombie Jesus.  He moved that rock and he was zombying around for a while.  Came out.  Zombie Jesus.  Zombie Jesus.  Yeah.  Any other religion has that?  Has zombies?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Buddha's the fat guy.  Supposedly it's not the fat guy.  Really?  I got called out on that.  By who? 
[00:43:30]  I don't know.  I guess Buddha wasn't fat.  That's just...  No, I was saying.  By who?  Chang who?  He's a guy that's a...  Okay.  Wow.  I thought it was horrible.  Supposedly Buddha wasn't fat.  No?  I don't know.  People are going ouchie.  Yeah.  Supposedly that's just a symbol and the actual Buddha wasn't fat or something.  Really?  I don't know.  What about the elephant with the fucking six arms and shit?  That's cool shit.  That's like from Jason and the Argonauts.  What if that elephant took on Zombie Jesus?  Unless the elephant could land a headshot. 
[00:44:00]  I think Zombie Jesus is winning this one.  What about all those arms though, man?  Yeah.  Swinging around.  Mmm.  Is it arms?  Yeah.  It's got like the six arms and the elephant head.  Yeah.  Oh, there's boss.  Where's he walking to?  He's just fucking...  I'm walking here.  I don't know what he's doing.  I'm going to eat my sandwich.  All right.  We'll get him in next and fuck, we got a lot to do today.  Yes, we do.  All hilarious.  Hey!  Working hard, playing hard, America.  This is your blood brother of all things sonic bombast, Ted Nugent. 
[00:44:30]  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll.  In the cat scratch fever.  Cat scratch fever.  I got a bad scratch fever.  Ah, Ted.  Uncle Ted.  Cat scratch fever.  Oh!  I need no way.  I got to judge a train. 
[00:45:00]  You know you got it when you go insane.  It makes you warm and dry.  Try and work your face, my face.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  What do we got today, sexy?  Good morning, sexy.  Well, today is our good old Uncle Ted's birthday.  63 years old. 
[00:45:30]  63.  Wow.  Is that the guy that was at the...  Chemistry's still there after all these years.  63.  63.  Yeah, Ted's the big 63, huh?  Thank you.  Is that the guy that was at the live event doing stand-up?  Yes.  It was good.  What?  The guy that was at that event.  Oh, our event?  Yeah, the live event.  Remember the guy that went on at the end?  The old Italian guy doing stand-up dressed as Santa? 
[00:46:00]  You thought that was Ted Nugent?  No, I don't know.  I don't know who Uncle Ted is.  If you would have said Uncle Ted Nugent...  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Voss is here with us.  You know what?  Here's the conclusion I came to.  You never fucking disappoint.  Here's what I came to, and I said this to you.  Were you listening to the Ted Nugent song?  No, I just put it on, and I hear it's Uncle Ted's birthday.  Okay?  And even if I did hear the song, I wouldn't know a Ted Nugent song.  Now, here's the thing.  And I came...  I realized this during break, and before we get into anything, 
[00:46:30]  and you guys are friends of mine,  but after I did Unmasked,  I realized the difference between Ron and you guys.  He's an interviewer, and you guys are abusers.  It's the same...  It's like if you get pulled...  If you're like...  If cops are questioning you,  Ron would question you and go,  okay, where were you?  You guys would just beat the perp with sticks.  That's the difference.  But in the end, both are entertained.  Good cop, bad cop.  And both come out with an answer.  Right.  But that's not what you were saying to me  when we were having a nice heart-to-heart conversation last night, 
[00:47:00]  you weirdo.  I know.  I actually...  He goes, wow...  You're guilty of killing the English language anyway, so...  I actually go to...  I go to Rich last night.  We were talking a little bit on the phone,  and I go, you know, he did Unmasked.  He goes, yeah, that was amazing.  You know, we had a great time.  I go, yeah.  And I gave Ron his props.  I'm like, he's a great interviewer.  Oh, yeah.  He really knows what the fuck he's doing.  And then this idiot who just trashed us  and made it sound completely different than what he told me,  he goes, well, you guys are really good, too. 
[00:47:30]  I never said I wasn't a double agent.  I never said that I'm wishy-washy,  but here's the thing, okay?  On the phone, I can't deny before I come into studio,  I go, oh, you guys stink,  because then I won't be able to get in.  Well, that's true.  But, no, obviously, you guys know what you're doing.  No, I...  But like I said...  Ronnie really, really knows his way around.  Well, there's a difference, though.  It's amazing.  Like we said, it really is amazing to watch.  Ronnie's cocksure.  Sure.  He's cocksure.  What does that mean?  Ah, you know, he's got confidence.  That's right.  Oh.  And Fezzy, um... 
[00:48:00]  He does have a big one?  I don't know.  Oh.  Fezzy?  Well, it's not cocksure.  It's...  Ron Hose.  What?  Ron says...  Ron Hose on Mast.  Standalone.  Yeah.  We're talking about on Mast here.  Fezzy was very good at the pre, you know,  getting us ready and situated and stuff.  I mean, if it wasn't for him,  we, uh...  It wouldn't have went as smoothly as it did.  I think it takes a whole team.  Everyone has their roles.  What did Fezzy do for you? 
[00:48:30]  He greeted us.  Take us inside a little bit.  He greeted us,  took us to the dressing room,  made us feel comfortable,  got the video player working for the kid.  You know, he did some good stuff.  All right.  And he was talking,  and it's just good seeing him,  because I don't care what role you play.  So, you know...  You're trying to say he's a good hostess.  Oh.  No, no, I'm trying to say...  Wait, post-its.  I'm sure if he was in the interview, too,  it would have went just as well.  You know, this is terrible. 
[00:49:00]  What happened?  Well, I said Ronnie is cocksure.  Yeah.  I'm using a word from the past.  And Kevin from Connecticut points out  that Fezzy, it's more like,  cock, sure.  So that...  Well, we don't know.  We don't know.  We don't know.  I'm a big fan of both of them.  Yes.  Yes!  I've spent many, many a show  on the Ron and Fez show.  Not as much lately as I want to,  because I get the fuck out of here.  It's not like the old studio.  Well, we got that hour buffer, 
[00:49:30]  which sucks.  We got to get rid of that hour buffer.  Lots of buffers.  What do you mean?  Oh, sorry, Sam.  It's not like a buffer.  It's an hour buffer.  It's the buffer show.  Yeah, there'd be more interaction  if there wasn't that hour buffer  between us and Ron and Fez.  There'd be a crossover.  Imagine a fucking crossover.  Maybe it's time to get rid of the buffer.  How do you do a crossover  with someone you're looking at  the entire show  that you're doing anyway?  Here's the problem.  Like, hey, look who's here.  The guy that was here  the whole show, Sam.  You could eliminate the buffer show.  Yeah.  Except you guys have never stayed here 
[00:50:00]  after the show  as long as a single commercial break.  So it's still...  No, I remember Opie  staying for your show one day.  We were all staying for it.  Yeah, we've stayed, Sam.  I've stayed a lot.  At some point,  you've got to leave horribleness  and go,  I can't be a part of this.  And I have called in  from my truck.  I mean, how many hours  can you talk about wrestling?  Nobody gives a shit.  Why don't you fucking wrestle  with your own show  and make it better  and then people will stay?  More importantly,  I've never seen anyone  cut a banana so perfectly before. 
[00:50:30]  That was creepy.  What, you don't like the way  you cut the banana?  Every individual slices  the exact same size.  Good.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Did you see how he did that?  Rich has some issues  that come out  in things like  how he cuts a banana.  But as he's ranting about Sam,  he's perfectly cutting his banana  and I'm just looking in amazement.  I used to be a carpenter.  Oh, see?  Oh, so you know how to cut.  You have to cut.  Measure twice, cut once.  Well, you lose a lot of money 
[00:51:00]  if you cut the wrong jaw.  That's what they say.  Or a finger.  I know people  that have lost fingers.  Oh, yeah.  My sister's husband  just lost a couple fingers.  Oh, yeah?  And he's great.  And your sister.  I'm sorry, Rich.  That's terrible.  No, that's not tight enough.  What are you kidding me?  All right, listen.  We got to get into something.  I am quickly becoming, 
[00:51:30]  and it pains me to say this,  a fan of...  You better hurry  and get it out  before a joke comes out.  I know.  I don't want to say you're spender.  I knew when I paused  I would enjoy it.  I'm quickly becoming a fan  of Rich Voss and Bonnie's podcast.  They've only done what, four?  Four.  It's very fucking different  than what the other guys are doing.  It's on riotcast.com,  and we put the mic down. 
[00:52:00]  Sometimes we start off nice  and everything,  but it ends up in a fight.  It always does.  They're working out their shit  in front of everybody, Ant.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  It's really good.  It's great.  You know,  because Bonnie can easily hang with you.  Oh, she's funny as hell.  I want that.  I recognize that artwork.  Patented.  Yes.  That's cool.  The podcast is called  My Wife Hates Me.  It's Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane.  And I've been hooked 
[00:52:30]  since the first fucking episode.  Thank you.  I don't listen to a lot of podcasts.  And the thing is,  we sit there,  and I kind of like doing it,  but Bonnie hates it.  You know,  we were going to call...  I wouldn't know.  It's going to help your numbers  on the road.  I've seen it help other guys.  I'm telling you,  it's going to help your numbers.  But you guys are onto something.  Because it's not the typical,  like,  husband and wife team.  Yeah.  Everything is...  They're not cutesy.  No.  All cutesy and shit. 
[00:53:00]  They, like,  they take real shots  at each other.  Yeah.  They don't hold back nothing.  Here's the thing about Bonnie  and why she's cool.  Like,  we were at my father,  my sister's house  for Thanksgiving meal  the day after.  Yeah.  And my father's there,  my sister,  my father's wife,  my older daughter,  and a bunch of us  are sitting there.  And I said to Bonnie,  I go,  as everybody's quiet,  I go,  you know they like  my ex-wife better than you.  Right?  That's brutal.  And then Bonnie goes,  yeah, 
[00:53:30]  that's because she cooked.  So,  you know,  most girls would get all like,  eh, eh.  Oh, yeah.  She's like,  she goes,  Bonnie would go,  yeah,  you fucked up with her.  I don't know what you did wrong.  She was perfect.  How did you fuck that up?  Oh,  you know.  Turn it right back on you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is your ex-wife still hot?  Yeah,  I mean,  she lives in North Carolina.  I haven't seen her in six months.  Well,  I know.  But she was,  she's pretty.  She used to babysit your kids.  Yeah,  she babysat my,  well,  my four-year-old.  Yeah.  At the time,  yeah.  She babysits the kid you had with Bonnie. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  His ex-wife.  I still find that,  that's,  you know,  strange.  Well,  you know,  nowadays with the economy,  people got to do what they got to do.  She used to have a cleaning business and clean our house,  you know,  and that was kind of uncomfortable,  you know,  really?  Yeah.  Because,  you know,  all of a sudden she stumbles across the porn I have and,  and,  you know,  and this.  Your ex-wife cleaned your house?  She had a cleaning business.  That seems like a,  That is weird.  a privacy issue.  That's a little weird. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Well,  so is this podcast.  My ex-wife called me and said,  I'm listening to your podcast.  And I feel like I'm eavesdropping on another couple.  Yeah.  It's,  it's,  it's really good because you don't,  you don't feel like,  um,  you guys are just playing up to the microphones,  which is really hard to do.  No matter who you are,  you start off with topics or things you want to get to talk about or just have a conversation and,  and it goes awry.  Next thing you know,  she's yelling at me and I'm a piece of shit,  you know,  uh,  and I next, 
[00:55:00]  from now on,  I'm fighting back because I'm not going to take it.  The fourth episode,  I might a little,  but I told that,  uh,  cause,  uh,  what we're about to play is a huge blowout you guys had on the,  uh,  my wife hates me podcast and it's creepy where you're not even affected by it.  Look at how perfectly these bananas are cut.  Look at this.  Yeah.  Look at this.  Every banana is exactly the same.  He's a good banana cutter.  But you're not even affected.  Your wife is like fucking storming out.  She's pretty much in tears.  She's pretty much saying the only reason she's married to you is blah, 
[00:55:30]  blah,  blah.  We'll get into it.  And you're just like,  yeah,  whatever.  When are you coming back?  Cause we got to continue with the podcast.  Hey,  you know,  we have a show.  The show must go on.  Yes.  You know what I'm saying?  That's it.  I,  uh,  circus vernacular.  I think,  I think your podcast is going to do really well.  Thank you.  I'm making this prediction today.  There's something about it.  Yeah.  We already heard enough podcasts and they're good,  but this one,  there's something there,  man.  Well,  a TV show,  their website bought, 
[00:56:00]  bought five,  bought five clips that they want to air on their website.  Some TV show.  So the first week,  uh,  so you guys shooting video,  we're,  we're going to shoot video.  You got it.  If it's going to be on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No,  it's going to be on the internet for their website.  Okay.  So they bought five clips.  Here's Voss and Bonnie's.  My wife hates me podcast.  The,  uh,  the show's opening song.  Oh,  she really hates him.  It's really true. 
[00:56:30]  Why did she marry this jackass Jew?  Some people say that opposites attract,  but this seems more like a suicide pact.  He's totally sober.  She's not that drunk.  He's really old and she's got some smug.  He's totally holy as an asinine bomb and she's just a little less dumb.  She really hates him.  It's really true.  But somewhere deep down, 
[00:57:00]  she loves him too.  Holy shit.  You know what?  And,  and because no one wants to hear serious shit in general on this show,  but I,  I hear that in the podcast.  There's a love there too.  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  Who did that?  The song?  Yeah.  Uh,  uh,  you could have gave him a nice plug.  Did you just go,  uh,  you pay attention to anything?  You just grunted with a banana in your hand.  Boy,  you should have been on the TV before we were laughing and using words. 
[00:57:30]  You know,  you know,  the band or the singers out there right now going,  finally,  I'm going to get my big plug.  No,  you can't even plug.  You don't know who it is.  Rob Sprantz,  who runs the network,  Raya cast,  where my,  uh,  podcast,  Florentine,  Bobby Kelly,  a couple,  uh,  he's the one who got the,  the music.  Right.  And he went to,  uh,  professionals.  I'm not,  you know,  in New York,  New York.  You can tell that's like a jingle kind of,  uh,  jiggly thing.  Bonnie wrote the lyrics.  Bonnie wrote the lyrics.  Oh,  right.  But there,  and you do hear,  I mean,  you guys are fighting, 
[00:58:00]  uh,  you know,  scratching each other's eyes out,  but then you do hear the love.  You do hear the love between you.  I hope you feel,  I'm telling you,  maybe that's a little too sappy,  but you know,  well,  I mean,  I think it's there.  The fourth episode is really brutal.  Like she didn't want to air it.  Uh,  I don't know.  It just,  something clicks with women.  Like you could be talking and then it click.  Like she,  during that podcast,  you'll hear she's crazy. 
[00:58:30]  It's like,  you're going like,  wait,  which one?  We had an argument.  Episode four.  Yeah.  Episode four.  Oh,  cause episode two,  you're crazy.  Yeah.  You're completely crazy.  I'm on Bonnie's side on this one.  No.  Episode four is a new hope.  No,  but here's the thing.  Oh,  wait a minute.  Yesterday,  you know,  she says to me,  and this isn't podcast,  this is real life.  You know,  we're in this apartment until our place is rebuilt,  which they're gutting now.  Right.  And I go,  uh,  should we do this with the living room or that?  You know,  cause she goes,  I'm not investing anything into it. 
[00:59:00]  I don't want to live there.  Uh,  so whatever you want to do.  And so who,  who says,  even if we wanted to move,  it doesn't happen overnight.  You still have to sell your place,  buy a place,  you know,  it's not something that happens in a week,  you know?  So when,  when,  what is it going to take for you to realize she doesn't want to live there?  She fucking burnt your house down.  Yeah.  That's a good hint.  I think she made it pretty obvious to you.  She doesn't want to live there anymore.  I don't think she's smart.  Now you guys are rebuilding.  So she can go back in and she's going to set it on fire again.  No, 
[00:59:30]  she did.  You guys get the insurance money or they're onto you?  Yeah.  No,  please don't say that on the air.  It's not true.  It's not.  What are you kidding me?  There's five insurance companies.  I want to go after our insurance company.  Oh,  really?  Yeah.  But yeah,  because there was six units involved.  It started on our balcony.  You just showed some extreme guilt.  She says,  I don't want to live there.  Well,  she doesn't want to live there now.  It's all making sense now.  No,  she doesn't want to live there now after the fire because she was home when it happened.  Jesus,  I know.  Yeah.  You know,  I can have a fun.  I know.  No,  I know.  She's got like a anxiety being in a place that burned down. 
[01:00:00]  She thinks that all the neighbors hate her because she started the fire and they had smoke  damage and water damage.  Yeah,  but she didn't,  but it started on our balcony.  And like I said before,  you know,  the whole building smelled smoke.  Somebody could have found where it was coming from,  you know?  So,  but she thinks everybody's going to point at her like,  you know,  fucking Carrie at the prom or something,  you know?  And I'm going to leave the pack.  I'm going to go to the neighbors. 
[01:00:30]  That's the one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So she says,  I don't want to live.  I'm not investing anything.  So how do you,  how do you live with somebody where,  you know,  they don't want to be there?  You know,  you can't just move to New York or California unless you have a fucking million dollars.  Did you used to live there with your ex?  Where?  In this place.  Oh,  no.  Okay.  All right.  No.  Well,  then move on.  You probably should at some point think about getting rid of it.  Yeah.  Just,  I would love to move.  I would love to get the place back together,  put it on the market and find a new place for you guys.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  I would love to,  if I sell,  a hundred thousand of my CDs that go up on iTunes today called Still Empty Inside,  I will get a new place.  If I sell,  not even a hundred,  50,000 folks.  50,000.  Is that that many?  The CD looks really good.  I can't wait to track through it.  It's called Still Empty Inside.  It's my best one out of all three.  New CD.  And it's on what?  iTunes?  iTunes.  All right.  Stop babbling.  Okay.  Because we want to do the podcast thing here.  A couple samples of the podcast and then we'll get into the finance.  Oh,  please.  Okay.  So a little more of Rich and Bonnie here. 
[01:01:30]  Everything's plugged in.  I can hear myself.  You can hear yourself?  I just said that I could.  Into the microphone?  I mean into the ear speakers?  The head speakers.  What?  Okay.  Here's the thing.  The head speakers, Rich?  The headphones.  Headphones.  The headphones.  We've got to put this right in the middle.  What else did you think I could hear?  Like,  do you think I've gone around in life not be able to hear myself talking?  No,  but don't lean into it because then your voice is louder than mine. 
[01:02:00]  We have to stay.  I'm still hearing my voice.  We have to stay right in between.  You put the microphone.  And then you quit banging on the table.  I'm not banging on the table.  Oh my God.  I'm telling you,  I'm so hooked on this podcast.  I don't talk about anyone's podcast.  It really is.  I don't talk about anyone's.  Do you understand what's going on here?  What?  Every day people tweet me and go,  can you listen to my podcast and give me feedback?  No.  No.  I'm obsessed with this stupid podcast.  I don't know how this happened. 
[01:02:30]  And people are saying that the Opie prediction curse is going to fuck you over.  I'm telling you,  no.  People are going to fucking find this thing and enjoy it.  Did you leave the track on where they started arguing over the pounding of the table?  I don't know if that's in there.  Because he's obsessed because she's pounding on the table.  And she's like,  no one's fucking going to hear this anyway.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, shit.  You can tell she doesn't want to be there. 
[01:03:00]  You're sort of forcing her.  But she is there.  So she is going to give some effort.  She's reading magazines.  That's what we're doing here.  Just totally disinterested.  Yeah.  It's like.  Wow.  All right.  And here's.  We're going to get right into it now.  Rich thinks John Stamos was hitting on Bonnie.  Oh.  Doesn't know who he is and what he does.  What?  I guess Bonnie was in L.A. for what?  Pilot season or something?  She was writing on a pilot.  Writing on a pilot.  So she was out there for a little while and Rich gets word that John Stamos said hi to 
[01:03:30]  Bonnie or Bonnie said hi to John Stamos who was hanging out with T.J. Miller, a guy we  know.  Oh, okay.  I was here.  What?  And you were there.  Yeah.  And so what?  You were in a restaurant?  No, we were at the Laugh Factory and all of a sudden I walk upstairs and I see Bonnie sitting  with T.J. Miller and John Stamos.  So I sit down and I'm saying, oh, he looks familiar.  And then it hits me who he is.  Uh, and, and, and, you know, you'll, you'll hear it going, you know, but.  Okay.  And, and, Iraq, did you leave the Twitter shit on here? 
[01:04:00]  Um, I, I left as much as I possibly could because it went on for so long.  I had to just kind of skip through it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, that's the main stuff to Twitter.  I'll tell you.  If the Twitter's not on there, that's what.  I know.  That's why I'm asking.  That's what ties it all together.  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, boy.  Because then what happens, just so you know, she meets John Stamos and T.J.  Miller.  Well, she knows T.J. Miller and Rich is there.  So she decides, all right, now that I kind of talk to the guy, I'm going to follow him  on Twitter.  Sounds logical to me.  Yeah.  Not, not Rich.  That means they're fucking. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, okay.  That means they're fucking.  Oh, oh, see.  Oh, Rich.  No, that means they're fucking.  This is, this is how psychotic this guy is.  Now I get it.  Now I get it.  A couple months ago, we were at the Laugh Factory in L.A.  and we're, we're hanging out, uh, with a comic and, uh, we're sitting there and then.  Just talk to me.  Then we're sitting there and what's his name?  John Stamos?  That's it.  John, from what?  Three.  What was he on?  Uh, Bob Saget.  What was it?  Little House on the Prairie. 
[01:05:00]  What was it?  What was it called?  My Two Dads.  My Two.  No, it wasn't.  Was it?  No, it was called, oh, uh, with the Olsen.  Happy House.  No, it was with the Olsen twins.  Whatever.  You know.  Full House.  Full House, baby.  Three aces over two queens.  Full House.  That's a Full House.  Do you know what a Full House is?  In cards?  When you say dumb things, I'm going to, from now on, just go silent.  So, I'm not even wearing my headphones now.  That's how I roll. 
[01:05:30]  Your speakers.  Oh, she's just fucking picking at you.  Pick, pick, pick, pick.  Oh.  Are you going to hear?  One day, you're just going to hear Rich just stabbing her to death.  That's what we did in the first episode.  You heard?  First.  Yeah.  Wow.  It continues.  Here we go.  Let's just play this.  I told him right in front of you that I said, this is my husband, Rich Voss, but don't  let that mar your decision to not hit on me. 
[01:06:00]  But that was a joke.  Really?  You think guys take a, don't let, you're telling him, I mean, don't get me wrong.  If you were to have sex with him and I was watching, that'd be different.  But behind my back is a whole nother thing.  You know, if I was in the room, okay.  At least you're with a celebrity.  Oh, first of all, that's so gay for you to use your wife as bait and like, I'm going  to hide in the closet.  You get his clothes off.  Like, that's really what you're saying, isn't it?  No, I'm not going to come out of the closet. 
[01:06:30]  I want to see his genitals.  No.  But I want to stay in the closet.  No.  Literally and figuratively.  No.  So.  Are you gay?  No, I'm not gay.  Just tell me.  Wow, man.  She's tough.  And she has a great vocabulary.  Oh, one of those.  Yeah.  Yes.  Literally and, you know.  Figuratively.  Wow.  Without stammering.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:07:00]  This isn't on.  Well, why is that moving?  I think it's supposed to be blinking.  Well, it looks like it's recording to me.  I don't know.  Yeah, I think it's on.  What do you think?  All right.  So, anyhow.  This is the audio from the Challenger right before it explodes.  It's uploaded dead air.  Is it moving on the computer?  Yeah, it's moving.  See, that's what's good about radio.  They have all the people doing all the technical crap and they just talk.  Now we got to do the talking and do the engineering. 
[01:07:30]  Engineering.  You know what I mean?  It's tough.  I do know what you mean because it was only two things that you said and they were pretty  simple.  So, I got it right away.  Holy shit.  Well, you got a microphone and a computer, I would assume.  There's no mixing board or anything.  It's just a mic shoved into a computer.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  These technical issues. 
[01:08:00]  We had to press the button on the mic.  Well, you got to press the button.  Are you hooked, Ed?  Oh, I love this.  I fucking love this.  I'm just, for whatever reason, I'm hooked.  You know what, though?  And this is odd.  Like, a lot of people are thinking, oh, rich, rich, rich, rich, and oh, poor Bonnie or this,  or Bonnie's smart, or listen to Bonnie.  I'm catching, like, Bonnie's being very fucking bitchy on this.  Like, she's just fucking, she's fucking with you.  She pushes my button.  Yes.  Yeah, but.  Yes. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, but it's because of him.  I don't know.  I'm not seeing that.  We can have discussion groups about this dumb podcast because she's frustrated because  she, he thinks that she's fucking John Stamos.  She knows where this is going, and she's extremely annoyed, which you're going to find out in  a minute a year.  She loses it.  She got all pissy, though, like, right away.  Yeah, I know.  She's like, who the fuck do you think you are?  I set the whole thing up.  I do all the technical work with the podcast company.  All she has to do is walk in and sit down.  It's good for both of you, and. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, but you're, you can just pick, pick, pick.  You, uh, you accuse her of sleeping with just about everyone.  Well, but he.  I saw a cut of your movie, and there's a whole Dane Cook thing.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What happened there?  Nothing.  That part of the movie, I don't want people to know.  Oh.  Spoiler.  Yeah.  Spoiler.  Funny.  That's funny.  All right, but.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough, sir. 
[01:09:30]  I like the movie, too, by the way.  Thanks.  Oh, fuck.  Too many projects to promote for Rich Voss.  His podcast, his CD, a movie coming out.  It's crazy.  All right, Rich is upset that Bonnie is following Stamos on Twitter.  Is that Bonnie?  No, it's the guy that says who wrote the jingle.  Oh.  Carla Capretto did the jingle.  Carla Capretto did the jingle.  I hope that's a real name, by the way, because with Rich saying it, you never know.  I should put my glasses on.  Yeah, you probably should. 
[01:10:00]  That was Carla.  All right.  Rich is upset.  Here we go.  This is where it starts ramping up.  Rich is upset that Bonnie is following Stamos on Twitter, and they learn, he learns about  Cuckold.  And then I would.  Why are you getting mad?  I'm getting mad because it was hard.  It was very hard.  Like, single moms, it's hard.  You're out gallivanting.  Oh, okay.  You know what?  We should have probably went long form with this.  Fuck it.  What else are we doing today?  Exactly.  Iraq, you did a good job.  But she's really mad right there because she went to L.A. to write for this pilot, but 
[01:10:30]  she brought her four-year-old daughter.  So she had some help to kind of help her through the whole thing.  Oh, okay.  And I wasn't in L.A. with her.  I was doing, you know.  And even though she had help, it was still very hard, but you downplayed that, and she's  basically saying, look, you got to stay home and do whatever the fuck you want.  I'm with our daughter out in L.A. trying to, like, write for something that might be  picked up by TV.  I came out there for three days.  I played golf, two of them, but I came out there to visit, you know, on my dime.  And then I would. 
[01:11:00]  Why are you getting mad?  I'm getting mad because it was hard.  It was very hard.  You think about, like, single moms, it's hard.  You're out gallivanting, doing whatever you want to do, and I'm there working and raising  our daughter, and instead of being like, you're amazing, that was great, you know, whatever.  I thought it was great.  No, instead you're saying, you fucked John Stamos.  I never said that once.  Never once did that ever come out of my mind.  What did you say?  I said, you go out with him and meet him at a party.  I never said that.  I think if we rolled this tape back, you did say you fucked John Stamos. 
[01:11:30]  I didn't say it.  You go, I think you fucked him.  I didn't say that ever.  That's disgusting.  Whatever, that I was with him or that I did something untoward.  I never accused you.  That you're a cuckold.  All that kind of stuff.  Well, first of all, what's a cuckold?  You heard that in a movie last night.  No, I've known that word for a long time.  What's a cuckold?  I tried to tell you that word years ago.  What's a cuckold?  It's what you did with John Stamos.  It's when the man gets cheated on.  He's a cuckold.  Really?  Yeah.  I never heard that.  Well, that's because you went to a black high school. 
[01:12:00]  Let me catch it.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  She's fucking funny.  What happened was, we were in L.A., and she's sitting talking to him, and he's asking her  questions like, oh, are you married?  This and that.  You know, the questions.  Oh, yeah.  The single questions.  Yeah.  This is my husband right here.  More basic questions.  Okay.  Okay.  So they're basic.  But then when we get home, I don't know what it was and how it happened. 
[01:12:30]  I was on Twitter, and somehow I went to her.  Somehow I see, all of a sudden, she's following John Stamos on Twitter.  I'm going, really?  Why would you follow?  He's not a comedian.  How funny could he be?  You know?  So, you know, you're in L.A.  He's flirting with you, which I thought maybe not.  Okay.  Because he's a 10, and I said this in the podcast.  He's a 10, and you're a 4.  But here's the thing.  Oh, shit.  See, the reason why I'm speaking up so much, because Bonnie's not here.  That's the only reason.  Yeah.  Because she can fight her own battle, but I'm just giving her side. 
[01:13:00]  But you, like, try to keep her down.  I don't.  If you.  You want to say that everyone wants to fuck her, but then you also want to tell everyone  that she's only a 4, maybe a 5.  I got to keep her self-esteem down, or she'll leave.  What the fuck?  True.  True.  You can't make her believe she's a 9 or an 8.  Then she'll go, well, what the fuck?  What am I doing here?  Right.  So, the thing is, you know, listen, it's all circumstantial evidence, but.  Circumstantial evidence.  It was a conversation. 
[01:13:30]  Okay, but then all of a sudden.  You're whipping it up to be some kind of fucking circumstantial evidence.  All of a sudden, she's following John St.  Come on.  It's a coincidence.  You know what I'm saying?  No.  She met him.  Yeah.  They talked, and she's like, eh, let me see what this guy's up to.  It's kind of like what we do on this show.  Some of the people come in, we meet, and I'm like, eh, I'm going to follow him.  Yeah, see what they're up to.  I'm going to see what they're up to now.  I don't fucking meet people all the time.  I don't follow them.  I follow, like, 20 people.  You guys.  What the fuck?  Follow him?  John Stamos is really going to change the world? 
[01:14:00]  What he tweets?  No, but she had a conversation with him.  Maybe she just wants to see a little bit of what he's into, what he does on a daily basis.  Or you can look at it from that point of view, or you can look at it as, oh, shit, is he  going to tell the world that he fucked me?  Not saying he did.  Wow.  Thank you, man.  He has this figured out.  Thank you.  Ten fucking avenues.  I knew he would bury himself eventually.  Now you understand.  I don't think she would, but I'm saying.  I am team Bonnie on this one. 
[01:14:30]  No, here's the thing.  Bonnie says.  You think your wife fucked John Stamos?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  No.  She could have blown him.  Handy?  See?  Handjob?  No.  I don't think anything.  Old school?  And know what it is?  It's not Bonnie, and it's not what upsets me, because I trust her.  It's the disrespect you get from guys.  Guys are scumbags.  I'll agree with you.  Sure.  I'll agree with you.  Sure.  If someone knows you're married, don't fucking disrespect me.  I'm not saying he did, but anybody. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  All right.  But don't disrespect me and hit on my wife.  And I don't care if, well, that's a compliment.  No, it's not.  Don't disrespect me.  You're right.  And I'm not saying he did, but there is comics that have hit on my wife.  Okay.  And you're disrespecting me.  I agree with that.  Okay.  Fair enough.  But you also got to have that trust.  Huh?  Who?  Amy Schumer?  No.  I didn't say, I didn't say, I didn't say, I didn't say do her on stage.  I said, get on it.  No, Amy's not doing bonnie.  We, Amy came up to me.  If they ever do, could you please videotape that?  Make a documentary of that one.  Okay.  So, that's what pisses me off. 
[01:15:30]  And then they had a whole discussion, which female comics are, are cute and which ones aren't.  Oh.  We did?  It's a short list.  And Amy was like, you know, you gave a, uh.  You gave Amy the kind of.  I did?  She's kind of cute.  I mean, what the fuck?  But you said she isn't hot or something.  No, Amy, listen.  If you saw, Amy's a good looking girl.  She's, you know.  But if you saw her walking down the street, you go, huh.  But in the comedy community, of course, when you compare her to like, you know, Jessica  Curzon or Judy Gold, you know, whatever. 
[01:16:00]  And I'm saying Judy's not good looking, you know, in her own way.  Judy Gold's a beast.  She's funny.  She's very funny.  She's funny.  Well, whatever.  In the comedy community.  Like, if I saw Amy just walking down the street, and she dresses kind of slutty and  stuff, I would be like, wow, she's cute.  No, you would be like, wow, she's too old for you.  All right.  Okay.  But I would say she was probably cute in high school.  Okay.  I don't think.  I think Judy Gold would even say that she's not cute.  Yeah, yeah.  She's a beast.  She's as big as that door.  I mean, you can't call her a beast. 
[01:16:30]  But she's not a beast.  She's beastly.  She's very funny.  She's not beastly.  There's nothing feminine about her to begin with.  Who was that fucking blonde comic that was in here sitting there?  Oh, yeah.  She was really cute.  What was her name?  Let's see.  Let's see if the listeners got it.  Liz.  Liz.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  No, it wasn't Lisa Lampanelli.  No, the little.  Eliza.  Schlesinger?  Yeah, Schlesinger.  She wears a lot of makeup.  She's all right.  She's got a nice body.  She's really fucking cute.  No, she's got a nice body. 
[01:17:00]  But if you see her.  Sitting right there.  I saw her in the morning.  She's got a lot of makeup.  Would you fuck her?  Would I?  I'm married.  I said, did you fuck her?  No, we were on the road.  We were working.  Me, her, and Gary Goldman were doing the show.  Girls don't look fucking that hot in the morning.  But look at this.  She's fucking.  Yeah, she's okay.  I think she looks really good.  She's pretty good in that show.  She has sheet place on the list.  What do you mean?  When you guys are talking about it.  What?  You know, that little Asian girl that comes in.  She's cute.  Oh, yeah.  She's nuts.  She's crazy.  She's batshit crazy.  We haven't had her on in a while.  Eliza Schlesinger. 
[01:17:30]  She looks good, man.  She's great.  She's cute.  She looks really good.  She's got a nice body.  All right, let's get back to the podcast.  Oh, man, look at that.  Right?  Get the fuck out of here.  This is what gets me with females.  You're a comic, so don't try to sell sexuality.  If you're, and Bonnie agrees with that.  Look, it fucking downplays comedy, okay?  Does it?  Do you want to be a fucking model or a comic, all right?  When you look at that, you go, oh, I want to go see, oh, she's funny?  No.  You look at her and go, I want to fuck her.  Okay?  If she's, but if you see her and she's funny, it's a double-edged sword of, wow, she's really 
[01:18:00]  funny, and she's so fuckable.  You know what?  I just think, you know, a female comic.  Oh, damn it, man.  She looks good.  I'm sorry.  What's wrong with you, Rich?  I didn't say she was up there.  I said she's all right.  Rich is queer.  You're half a fag.  Rich is a queer.  I like the guy on the left better than her.  Well, he does have a nice structure in this.  All right, listen, let's get back to this.  This is amazing.  I'm telling you.  So this gets into the whole Twitter thing.  Did we do the Twitter one with the cuckold?  We did, right? 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  Bonnie starts really losing it, because she's finally had it.  All right.  Two nights ago, yelling.  I didn't yell.  You yelled.  You're following John Stamos.  Yeah, I bet you had sex with him.  I didn't say that.  You just said right here today, I bet you did.  I bet you were with him after I left LA.  I didn't say that.  I bet you went to a party.  I didn't say with him sexually.  Rich, you know what?  You're such an asshole.  Why don't you go to a fucking meeting?  Isn't the whole thing about AA, like, be truthful, tell the truth?  You stop trying to manipulate me right now. 
[01:19:00]  Because you know what you're saying?  You're saying you fucked John Stamos.  I did that.  And John Stamos is actually just a word in this situation for anybody, okay?  Because the truth of the matter is, and you know it deep down inside like I know it, that  everyone is better than you, okay?  And that's why you think I'm going to cheat on you, because you can't believe anybody would  want to stay with you, which is exactly the way you should think, because you are a jerk.  You're an asshole, and you're a douchebag, and there's nothing. 
[01:19:30]  Why would anyone stay here?  And I'll tell you, the only reason is because of our daughter, Raina.  And until you fucking measure up a little bit.  Oh, so you're calling me short.  And then he's psychotic, and none of this bothers him.  All right.  That's brutal.  And I'm in.  That's fucking brutal.  I'm in.  I'm all in with this podcast.  Because that is some honesty most people would have cut out and said, fuck that, we can't  do it.  One part that was very funny there was when she was trying to use John Stamos as a metaphor. 
[01:20:00]  And it's like, Rich, she's trying to fucking use a metaphor with Rich.  No, with Rich, it's, you fucked John Stamos.  Well, figuratively, you mean John Stamos is every man.  No, you fucked John Stamos.  Like, don't try to do a metaphor thing with Rich, Bonnie, please.  And we've heard it so many times over the years, you know, he's suspicious it's not  his daughter, even though the daughter looks just like him.  I remember the great tile in the kitchen incident, where how did the neighbor know about the 
[01:20:30]  new tile in the kitchen?  Well, I have another one.  Oh, do you?  That's what I was just getting at.  I love this.  Okay.  All right, Columbo, what do you got now?  Okay, look at this.  Now, you've got to follow me on this.  Okay.  All right.  You see the door.  Okay.  I can see a door.  Yes.  This door goes from the hallway into our bedroom.  Okay.  From outside.  From outside.  Okay, there's a latch here.  There's a latch on your door on the inside.  On the inside.  Okay.  One that goes like this.  Yeah, a slidey latch.  I was on the road.  I came back home. 
[01:21:00]  So you can virtually lock yourself in the bedroom.  If you want to lock yourself in.  If you want to lock yourself in.  Okay.  So the latch was broken, like somebody was pushing the door.  Oh.  Okay.  So, you can't lock.  How does that happen?  How does that, unless the door's locked and she doesn't see it and rams it open?  Now, there's no way to lock it from the outside with leaving no one inside and go, oh, I'm going to have to break in.  So, here's my theory.  The door was locked.  This could be it.  I'm not saying her, but this could be a good theory in FB as a profiler when you come home. 
[01:21:30]  Okay.  You know the four-year-old doesn't have the strength at the time, three years old, to push the door and to break the wood where the lock is.  Of course.  Okay.  So, maybe, and just a theory, and not accusing her because I love her.  I love her.  But as a kid coming home, you see that, you're going, well, maybe she's seeing somebody or dating somebody.  They had a fight.  He locked her out, and he's banging on the door to get back into the room.  To the bedroom. 
[01:22:00]  To the bedroom.  And, you know, a fight happens in your affair, and she locks the door, and he bats her.  How about this one?  Okay.  She went, is the bathroom in the bedroom, or do you have to go out that door to go to the bathroom?  You have to go out that door.  Well, there's two bathrooms.  There's a bedroom.  There's two.  There's one on the inside of the lock and one on the outside.  How about this?  For some reason, she had to leave the bedroom.  Yeah.  The guy locks her out and goes, no, I'm going to rummage through the shit and see what fucking your husband's about and everything.  She's like, no, no.  And she's the one that was kicking it in.  Well, either way, there's a guy there.  Why would you say that? 
[01:22:30]  It just makes it more fucking, it just gets me more crazy.  Well, I wasn't coming up with a solution you would like.  But why would that lock?  It's pretty obvious she's cheating on you.  No, it's not.  But why would that lock be broken?  You see what I'm saying?  Hold on.  Let me ask you a question.  Can you lock the door and close it behind you?  You know what I mean?  No, it's a latch.  Oh, it's a slide latch.  Okay, I got you.  Okay, I'm really seriously for a second going to think about any circumstance where she would have to break that or that would break.  Okay, here's what happens. 
[01:23:00]  The door is locked from the inside.  She's in there.  Yeah.  She wakes up.  She goes to leave the room, totally forgets that it's locked, pulls on the knob, and pops the fucking lock off.  That could happen.  And goes like, oh, fuck, I forgot it was locked.  That could happen.  All right.  What did she tell you?  When she's never locked that lock at night going to sleep.  Well, she locks it when you're gone, probably.  Maybe when you're gone, you know.  To feel more secure, she just once decided to do it.  What did she tell you?  And if she doesn't do it that often, that would make a better excuse for the fact that she forgot she had done it. 
[01:23:30]  But when she'd tell me, she goes, I don't know.  Things happen.  Oh, boy.  She's so cheating on that.  No, that's fucking with you.  Because if she was cheating, she'd have come up with an excuse.  She'd have come up with an excuse to go, I don't fucking know.  What are you talking about?  That's what she said.  I don't fucking know.  If you're cheating, your guilt makes you go, well, okay, it was locked.  I came up to the door.  See, for her to go, I don't know, shut up, means she's not cheating.  No, she's a good actress. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Well, but what I'm saying, I'm just saying, circumstantial evidence.  Get your headphones on.  We got someone on the hotline.  All right.  Oh, it's...  Voss, you're an idiot.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did you really say Elijah Schlesinger's not that hot?  I said she's out.  That is crazy.  No, I said she's okay.  She's...  Listen.  She's more than okay.  Hold on.  What number would you...  What's that?  What number would you give her?  Do the spit?  First of all...  What would you give her? 
[01:24:30]  You like giving out numbers.  I'd give her a seven.  You know, with makeup.  I love it.  She doesn't have...  Without makeup, she's not that hot.  Seven is respectable.  What are you talking about?  I've seen...  First of all, Joe, we have different standards because look at you and look at me.  So there's different standards.  Look, throughout my life, I was used to hot girls.  You're used to anybody that'll talk to you.  So here's the thing.  You're going to think...  Listen, I'm aware that we have different standards.  I'm aware of that.  But you know, I think she's hot.  I really do.  You know what? 
[01:25:00]  She is so fucking hot.  First of all, we're looking at him through the window, and he's bent over, but he's really  sitting up.  Okay?  You fucking scoliosis douchebag.  Let me...  Oh, let's go after this speech impediment.  That's okay.  It hasn't hampered my career in any way.  Second of all, I worked with...  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  If it wasn't for Billy and Bobby, you'd be fucking making cookies somewhere.  Anyhow, listen to me.  Okay?  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  I know.  Listen to me for those cookies, you said.  My wife sends him cookies. 
[01:25:30]  First of all, we give him...  He stays at my house.  We give him...  My wife makes the best cookies with applesauce instead of butter, and they're great.  And I'll bring some in.  And he goes, they stink.  You know why?  Because old fucking fatso that only eats mayonnaise on anything.  Okay?  If they were mayonnaise cookies, he would love them.  Okay?  So my...  Let's just be honest, guys.  How many times have you been eating a cookie and thought to yourself, I wish this had apple  sauce in it instead of butter?  No, well, wait till you taste them. 
[01:26:00]  You know what?  Joe does make a good point.  When you're eating cookies, you don't give a fuck about the fact that it might be bad for you.  Well, anyhow, so Bonnie made some cookies that Joe would like with butter and sugar and stuff.  Why is she making cookies for Joe?  That's a little weird.  I know.  I thought you don't think...  I don't think something's going on there.  Okay?  Joe fixed the lock he broke.  Okay?  I thought it was a bit forward myself.  So, Joe...  Bonnie sends Joe a box of cookies.  Yeah.  Joe calls Bonnie yesterday and goes, I got your cookies.  I haven't tried them. 
[01:26:30]  How hard is it to take a fucking bite out of a cookie before you make a call?  Like, I got your cookies.  I didn't try it.  It's not like something you have to prepare.  Dick move.  It's not something you have to prepare.  You make believe you tried the cookies.  You know, you could have taken a bite and go, oh, they're great.  Fake it.  You're right.  Or, you know, whatever.  But...  I ate some this morning.  They were delicious.  Oh, don't...  Ugh.  They were.  They weren't bad.  All right, listen.  We got to play the rest of the fight here.  Fucking good.  I'm trying to sell your podcast.  And DeRosa's got to, you know, join us shortly. 
[01:27:00]  Is he in the building?  Is Joe here in the building?  Just looking at him.  It's creepy.  I'm really sitting out there with Kenny.  Kenny looks like he just fucking shot somebody.  He might have.  He might have.  It's a prison visit.  We got a prison visit going on here.  Put your tit against the fucking window.  You can bring...  Midnight Express.  You can, like, get his opinion.  Here's your fucking opinion.  He's got a good opinion.  Yeah, Joe, come on in.  They're like assholes' opinions.  Joe DeRosa, come on in, man.  All right, Joe.  All right, we're in the middle.  You passed the audition.  You're able to come in.  We did that to Richard Jennings once.  Yes, we did. 
[01:27:30]  And then he fucking hung himself.  Well, it was years later.  Of course.  It was years later.  What, did he shoot himself?  Yes.  I don't know.  I can't keep track of how you comics off your fucking selves.  You're all psychotic.  Now it's awkward, because now Joe's in here.  Hey, Joe.  Joe, we're in the middle of listening to Voss and Bonnie, My Wife Hates Me podcast.  And we're in the middle of a pretty good blowout, because Rich thinks Bonnie fucked  John Stamos.  Yeah.  By the way, I'm part of this argument.  You're part of this.  Yeah, when he goes, when she goes some comic. 
[01:28:00]  That's why you're in now.  Yeah.  Sit down.  Yeah, all right.  It's the second part of the fight about to start.  Oh, boy.  So you know exactly what's going on here.  Yeah, I've heard this.  Okay, Bonnie has enough and walks out.  I can't take it anymore.  What are you doing?  I cook for you.  I clean for you.  I fucking write all your dumb correspondence for you.  You know, anything you need, I do.  Rich can write his own dumb stuff.  And what things do I get?  Oh, you.  I made a movie starring you, okay?  Oh, we made it.  You made it. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, you fucked the editor.  Oh, yeah.  I never said that one.  Did you say that, too?  Oh, no.  Maybe once or twice.  Why would you fuck the editor?  He's a good-looking guy.  Did he?  Was it a short fucking?  But everything was well-placed?  You know, I think this ass-fucking's going a little long.  We should probably...  We're going to cut down the foreplay a little bit.  It's going a little long.  I'd like to cut away to your clit right now. 
[01:29:00]  Wow, you're insecure.  I never said I wasn't.  I've had bad experiences in life.  Oh, fuck.  Starring you, okay?  Oh, we made it.  Oh, you fucked the editor.  Oh, you.  I never said that once.  And don't say you made the movie.  We made the movie, okay?  So don't act like you made the movie.  And you brought this all up just to get yourself worked up.  No, I didn't.  You're not happy unless you're fighting.  You're never happy unless you are all...  We said it.  Who...  Who started off...  Who goes from seeing somebody following someone on Twitter to you fuck them? 
[01:29:30]  Who does that?  I never said that once.  You know what you're saying.  You're yelling.  See, here's...  I'm sitting away with...  Oh, my God.  I do so bad shit.  I'm not even doing this anymore.  Oh, shit.  Go have your own fucking podcast.  Are you serious?  Wow.  You know what that reminded me of for a little bit?  Huh?  Remember Creepshow where Adrienne Barbeau was in it?  Yeah.  And the guy...  And she was just like,  What would you do without me?  You're a piece of shit. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  And he was just like,  Yes, dear.  Yes, dear.  And he had the fantasy at the party that he just raised a gun to her head  and blew our fucking brains out.  And everyone was like,  Good shot.  That's right.  Adrienne Barbeau in Creepshow.  Very good.  Good reference.  What the fuck?  Oh, what would you do without me?  You're a baby, you fucking...  Hal Holbrook.  That was it.  Yeah.  I had a similar fantasy while listening to that,  but I was picturing Voss getting shot through the head.  Oh, it was Voss?  I don't know.  That's why he thinks Elijah's hot.  Joe, did you break the lock?  Bonnie is antagonizing you in that whole thing. 
[01:30:30]  Fuck what you said.  I'm being serious here.  Bonnie's way over the top with this thing.  You didn't deserve what you got.  I didn't deserve it.  You didn't deserve the shit that Bonnie gave you.  I just said it's a coincidence.  You guys are insane.  Any guy would bring up, regardless of how you brought it up,  maybe you brought it up a little rough and stuff,  but the fact of the matter is, you walk in,  and she was talking to John Stamos,  and then she's following her on Twitter.  You would at least have the right to ask,  like, hey, what's going on? 
[01:31:00]  But Rich thinks she's fucking everyone,  so she's finally had it, right, Joe?  I'm with Opie 100% on this one.  This is way more than the John Stamos thing.  This is way more than the John Stamos incident.  Don't you guys understand that?  She took it right to 10, though.  It sounds like every guy she even looks at or talks to,  she's fucking in Rich's mind.  And that's every day, right?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Can I speak as being a partial component in this argument? 
[01:31:30]  Did you listen to the part where she's like,  our friend asked me to go on the road with him,  and you accused him of wanting to fuck me?  Did you play that part?  No, I didn't accuse him of you, the friend.  Yeah, it was me.  Oh, man.  It's at the beginning.  Did she fuck Joe, too?  No, no, no.  Before the fight in the pod,  before it gets to that point,  she says to him, she goes,  our friend asked me to go on the road with him,  and you called him and said,  stop trying to fuck my wife.  And I'm literally...  Oh, man.  Did he actually do that?  Yeah, and I'm literally listening to it going,  are Ridge and Bonnie fighting about me right now? 
[01:32:00]  What the fuck?  Did you actually call Joe DeRose?  Just sit down and quit trying to do your act  and be mad.  No one's buying it.  Here's what happened.  You're nuts, right?  Here's what happened.  You're fucking nuts.  Here's what happened.  Joe calls me and goes,  do you think Bonnie would want to open it?  And I know she didn't want it for the money,  and it's a hassle.  And he goes, well, see if you can find out.  I go, and jokingly, I go,  you want to fuck her, don't you?  That's all.  I didn't say.  All right.  I didn't accuse you.  But then how did it get brought up?  Yeah, how much of that's joking, 
[01:32:30]  and how much is that real?  If you only said that, then it's a joke.  I don't think Joe does because I think Joe has some integrity.  What's that?  90% joking, 10%.  Well, let's have him find out.  That one is joking,  but I think he's in this business hanging on by a thread,  and even though things aren't going as well for me as they were,  he wouldn't want to cross me because, you know,  I got a little power.  You can throw down still.  Rich can throw down.  I can call Billy and tell Billy to cut him out of the next movie or whatever. 
[01:33:00]  Listen, but dude, listen.  I mean, it's funny what you're saying.  Here's the thing.  Didn't you direct that one?  Yes.  Listen.  Yes.  Wait a minute.  Didn't I direct that movie that we put you in?  You fucking nothing.  First of all, you didn't put me in it.  You didn't put me in it.  We had to fucking improv your lines because you couldn't remember the script lines.  First of all, first of all, first of all, red eye that you didn't pay.  Okay, second of all, not only did I do it, 
[01:33:30]  I had to pay a babysitter, cab, and food, you low-budget cocksuckers.  I did you a favor because.  Low-budget cocksuckers?  It's a 10-minute film.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be low-budget.  Yes, we did.  Not for me.  Yes, we did.  You bought it for Colin because you thought he could help you.  You didn't buy it for me.  We had food every day.  You bought it for Opie and he wasn't even in the movie.  I'll tell you, we bought Bonnie lunch.  We bought Bonnie a lot of food.  Oh, shit.  Bonnie was great in the movie.  But listen, Bonnie, even though he was the director,  Bonnie was going to him,  why do you keep telling me what to do? 
[01:34:00]  You're not the director.  That's how bad of a director you are.  You didn't even have a clipboard.  That's not how bad of a director.  You didn't even have a clipboard.  That's not how bad of a director I am.  I'm not insecure where I walk around with a bullhorn and puffy pants going.  Oh, so you're saying Anthony's bullhorn and that's insecure.  Okay, here's my point.  Here's my point.  What you just said is so telling, Rich.  We're fucking friends.  Yes.  If I was married and you asked my wife or your friends about it,  and I was talking about this, I would go, 
[01:34:30]  I'd go, in a million fucking years, I know Voss would never do anything.  But you can't even say that.  No, you don't know me.  Listen to me.  You can't even say that about me, your friend.  You go, Joe's got a little integrity, and I'm pretty sure he wouldn't.  It's like, dude, you're fucking, you think this shit.  Here's the thing you don't understand because you're not a guy.  Guys, listen to me.  And this is true, and it goes for everybody in the fucking room and every guy.  Sam?  No, here's the thing, and I know Joe's a good friend because we wouldn't fucking send him. 
[01:35:00]  Here's the thing.  I know, but every guy, there's something in them that says, all right, if you're stuck,  say you're stuck with a girl, a married lady, not my wife, but a married lady,  you're stuck in an elevator or whatever.  You have to fuck in the elevator.  I don't know if I can make it these four floors without figuring this bitch.  You know, you know, there's something.  I was fired if I were going to be there in three minutes. 
[01:35:30]  Just don't do anything.  Three minutes, we'll have the door open.  Do you want to fuck?  We got three minutes.  No.  I was about to say something that most guys think, yes, but we're also able to just squash  that shit way down.  Most guys will think it, right?  But for some reason with you, it's on the surface all the fucking time.  Yeah.  What are you talking?  Well, I have an addictive person.  I know what you're going to say.  Yeah, we all think shit like that, but we're also able to push that shit down.  He's got a dick person.  Anthony's girlfriend walks in the room.  I want to push Anthony in front of a bus. 
[01:36:00]  Yes.  Because she's beautiful.  She'd probably be happy for you to do that.  You know what I'm saying?  So that's what this is all about, is he wants to fuck your girlfriend.  That's what this is all about.  No, I don't, because I don't want to go to jail for statutory rape.  Here's the thing.  I know.  I can trust.  I can trust.  But part of you does not trust Joe in that situation.  Oh, I trust a small percent.  No, I do, because I had him stay at my house.  Don't think I didn't sleep with one eye open, but I had him stay at my house.  It's always constant with him.  It's constant.  You don't know my history with women. 
[01:36:30]  All right, listen.  Can we play the rest of this?  You don't know my history.  I do want to hear this.  Bonnie talks about all the stuff he does for Rich.  We played this clip all the way through, right?  Your ear speakers just came off.  Whoa, there's something to laugh about.  It is.  It's kind of funny.  See?  See?  Now you're smiling, because you come up with it.  Huh?  The clip's on.  Jesus, Rich.  God damn it, Rich.  I'm trying to sell your fucking podcast. 
[01:37:00]  How stupid are you?  You are so stupid.  That fucking handicapped hot fries hat he's wearing knocked the fucking headphones off  of his head.  Thank you, Anthony.  I got it.  Let's do this for a living.  I'm trying to sell your fucking podcast.  Will you pay attention?  All right.  Go on, man.  My fucking head.  Holy shit.  He's babbling.  It's like, the audio's good enough.  Shut up.  Fuck.  Fuck.  I'm actually trying to help you today. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  Let's start again, Mother Teresa.  What the fuck?  What are you talking about, Mother Teresa?  Abusive Bonnie.  All right.  Bonnie talks about it.  All right.  I'm going to play this clip again.  And you're going to get up and walk away.  Oh, okay.  This is where she walks away.  Sure.  Okay.  All right.  Back on track, hopefully.  And you're going to get up and walk away.  No.  You won't admit what you're really saying.  Shut that down.  You're accusing me of doing...  I didn't accuse you... 
[01:38:00]  What are you accusing me of?  Dancing?  Are you accusing me of dancing with John Stamos?  Is that what you're accusing me of?  Yes.  Okay.  I didn't dance with John Stamos.  All right.  Then sit down.  You can't quit on the second podcast.  Wait till we...  You know what this podcast is called?  What?  My wife hates me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So sit down.  There's something...  I don't know what's going on.  Dude, it's not something wrong.  Anybody who's accused of...  Like, anybody who's constantly being accused of cheating, and then when they bring it up  and really try to get to the heart of the matter, the other person's like, I didn't 
[01:38:30]  say that.  I said, maybe you guys were playing footsies.  That's what I was saying.  Footsies?  That's what I was saying.  Footsies?  I thought maybe you guys did some kind of weird pinky thing.  That's all I'm saying.  It's like...  It's ridiculous.  First of all, you take everything to the extreme.  Why would you call it...  Really?  I take it to the extreme when my husband accuses me of cheating on him constantly.  No, I haven't...  Everyone, anyone who's ever listened to ONA knows that you do it.  So don't act now like you're...  Oh, no, no.  I never do.  No.  No.  Anything I do.  Any guy.  And you go like this. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, I bet you like him.  Then if I say it, then I go, yeah, stop doing it.  I'm just joking.  I'm just joking.  No.  But it's constant.  Okay?  And it eats away.  It's like a cancer.  It's not...  This relationship needs an oncologist.  That's what this relationship needs.  Oh, shit.  Because it has got cancer.  Oh, wow.  See?  Now you're smiling because you come up with a joke.  See?  Now you get what I'm...  Oh, man.  I'm fighting for Bonnie because she's not here.  Now you get it.  Yeah.  If it's constant like that, she's finally...  It's not constant.  She's finally had it.  It's not constant.  I know of... 
[01:39:30]  No.  With girls, it's never...  They'll say it's constant when it's like once every...  Exaggerate her in the world.  She really is what she is.  I've been with girls that if I do something and it's like once in a fucking blue moon, I'll  hear like, you always do this.  So that...  It's like, well, I haven't fucking done that.  In months.  I go months without it.  But she brings...  You know, she logs everything in her head.  And I'm going to tell you, she's great.  I'm not going to lie.  But she exaggerates.  She's out of her mind.  Yeah.  And she'll twist things.  She'll turn it into, you know, she's kind of a drama queen. 
[01:40:00]  I wish she was here.  Now, now, I'll agree with that, but you...  I'm not perfect.  You did kind of accuse her.  Kind of.  I didn't accuse her.  I said, what's going on?  Why are you following...  Yeah, what's going on?  Oh, you don't understand this.  When I walked into the room and go, are you following John Stamos, her eyes lit up like  I caught her going into the cookie jar.  Okay?  No, but that would be obvious.  If she's going to be sneaky, she...  But why would you be sneaky?  But why would she be like, oh my God, you're close.  You caught me.  It's so easy to see if she's following John Stamos. 
[01:40:30]  Well, and...  That's not something that you could hide easily at all.  But she was like...  It was kind of like, ooh, got me.  Has this point been brought up already?  If it has, I apologize.  Did you...  I mean, Rich, it's fucking John Stamos.  It's not a comic that lives in Jersey.  It's a fucking celebrity that's never going to bang your wife.  Do you know what I mean?  Are you kidding me?  You never banged a chubby before? 
[01:41:00]  Oh, shit.  No, I'm not saying my wife is...  Oh, wow.  No, no, no, no.  I didn't say my wife was.  Wow.  Rich's wife's a throwaway.  No, I'm saying people will bang, you know.  But, Rich, you banged a 70-year-old lady, didn't you?  No, 60, Rich.  Let's not get carried away.  Okay.  No, but here's the thing.  In better shape than you.  Yeah, exactly.  She had better abs than I did.  I'm not saying Bonnie's not hot enough for John Stamos to bang.  That's not what I'm saying.  What I'm saying is, it's never... 
[01:41:30]  So you think my wife's hot?  Yeah, she's fucking hot, Rich.  You think she's hot?  I think she's hot.  A lot of guys do, yeah.  Everybody thinks Bonnie's a hot girl, dude.  But that's not my point.  Okay, go ahead.  She's funny.  Would you relax?  She's funny.  She's hilarious.  You don't think your wife's hot?  She's a fucking catch.  I don't know if she's good looking.  Dude, the other night she looked good.  Jesus, Rich, could you dig this fucking hole any deeper for yourself right now?  Oh, my God.  Listen to me.  I'm not saying she's not hot enough for John Stamos to want to bang her.  What I'm saying is, it's never going to fucking happen. 
[01:42:00]  He lives in Hollywood.  What do you think John Stamos is going to fly Bonnie into Hollywood to bang her for the weekend?  Are you not going to figure this out?  She was there.  She's following a celebrity.  She's excited.  She's a housewife.  She's excited about this.  He thinks it already happened.  She was there.  He thinks it already happened.  He thinks it already happened?  They met at the Laugh Factory.  I was here, and he's asking her questions.  So, you're married?  You know, stuff like that.  When do you think she banged him?  Probably.  I didn't say she banged him.  I didn't say.  But I'm saying, what do you think?  If she banged him, when would that have happened? 
[01:42:30]  Let's just say.  No, I don't think she did.  In some weird fantasy world.  Where could it have possibly happened?  It's a very good question.  Huh?  Where did Bonnie bang John Stamos?  Probably in the ass.  I don't know.  No, I mean, where?  As far as her schedule goes.  I don't know.  I left L.A.  Please, how long is it?  So, you leave L.A. after they meet, so now you're like, holy fuck, she had a lot of opportunities  to bang John Stamos.  I didn't even think about it until I came home and saw the Twitter.  And saw the Twitter and her being in shock.  Do you ever check her phone and stuff like that?  In my life, did I do that?  No.  Okay. 
[01:43:00]  Okay.  That means you haven't.  No, I swear to God, I haven't.  All right.  Because...  Have you wanted to?  No, I mean, listen...  If you had the perfect opportunity to do it, would you?  It's been laying...  She's been asleep and it's been right next to me all night.  That means he just stares at it like...  Like a monolith.  He's like, ah, I gotta check that phone.  I don't check any of that.  Here's the thing.  What I've come to the conclusion in life.  And here's the thing.  People, not my wife or anybody, are gonna do what they do.  You can't control people. 
[01:43:30]  You can only do what you can do and be the best at what you can do.  Yeah.  I might say things, this and that.  But any of it is out of my control, good or bad.  Okay?  So, you know what?  Live and let live.  I don't think she's doing it.  I don't think she's doing it.  But, when you see these things as a guy, and a little insecure from some of my past history...  Okay, see?  I understand that part.  Most guys can understand that part of it.  But, like I said, you try to...  But you don't understand what I bring. 
[01:44:00]  Like I say, I might bring it up a couple of times.  But she exaggerates and says I do it all the time.  So, there's a fine line when I admit...  Yeah, sometimes I'm a fucking idiot.  Rich.  But you can't say I'm a fucking idiot all the time.  She exaggerates.  She was nagging there.  This is what I know of, and most of these are from the radio show.  Yeah, I'm writing.  Over a seven-year period.  I'm writing.  Okay.  That's true.  Put them all on one list.  I'm writing.  Yeah, then it's like the George Bush montage.  Right.  Yeah, seven years.  Seven years.  Which montage? 
[01:44:30]  And, all right.  I got this just off the top of my head.  I got five.  Okay.  I got five.  We're not even trying.  That one you don't want to mention.  That one you don't want to mention.  The Kyle guy.  Okay, hold on.  Joe DeRosa and the Locke guy.  Hold on, hold on.  That's five.  First of all, first of all, the third one, and I don't want to say it on the radio.  I understand.  It's all prefabbed.  It's all, it's not.  Well, then you're a better actor than I ever gave you credit for.  Yes, believe you me.  Trust me.  Believe me.  You should be getting some acting roles then. 
[01:45:00]  I'm telling you.  He saw it.  That was.  And then you also don't believe that you're the father of your own daughter.  I never said that.  So, you've never said that.  We've had our, we've talked about that for hours on our show.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing with kids.  Here's the thing with kids.  If you have a child who I do love her.  I play with.  I love her.  But if you have a kid from day one, everybody keeps going, oh, she doesn't look like you  at all.  So, everybody except you, okay, who could be the father, uh, Rich, Rich, spit it into 
[01:45:30]  the microphone.  Okay.  Hold on.  Okay.  Joe, you've seen his kid.  Hold on.  Wait.  It looks like fucking Rich Voss.  I laughed at, I know, look, I'm a, I got a little bit of a Kathleen Madigan thing where  I laugh after my own bits.  No, I'd fuck you.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  I just made myself lightheaded.  That's a lot of lightness. 
[01:46:00]  Here's the thing.  What were you saying?  I was saying, uh, what was I saying?  I don't know.  We got a break, by the way.  Oh, fuck.  Listen.  You can't get too early right here.  We got to wait.  Not going to keep me.  Not going to keep me here.  Right.  We got to keep me here to fucking all hours.  Why don't you try to figure out what you're saying?  Okay.  We got, we got three more clips from your podcast.  I think people should.  I'm serious.  They shouldn't fucking listen to this thing.  It's good.  People are calling it a clodcast.  A clodcast.  I like that.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing, folks.  And I'm serious. 
[01:46:30]  I've been dedicating and coming in here for 10 years.  My CD comes out on iTunes today.  I promise you, you'll fucking like it.  Yes.  Get it.  It's $7.  It's fucking funny.  I don't want your goddamn word, Rich.  Hell, I want FDIC.  Here's the thing.  You can get any O&A fan.  Fargo.  Of course.  You can get any O&A fan that has seen me on stage and not one can say they've ever seen  me fail.  Dude, no.  Of course not.  I don't know that.  I'm sad.  Listen.  That's because you never do new material.  Oh, really?  Oh.  I have three CDs.  I'm joking, Rich. 
[01:47:00]  That was a joke.  Yeah, but Jesus.  You're sounding desperate.  Listen to this.  It's a joke.  Rich Vos' new CDs on iTunes.  Still empty inside.  Yeah, it's a guarantee.  You're going to love it.  And also, the podcast.  Where do they go for that?  Even though we're going to play three more clips after the break.  Riotcast.com.  Riotcast.com.  There's four episodes so far, and I'm fucking hooked, man.  I am fucking hooked.  Stay there.  Thank you.  Sirius XM.  This is the O&A Today Show. 
[01:47:30]  All right.  We're hanging with Rich Vos and Joe DeRosa today.  And I'm trying to sell Rich's products.  He's got a CD, still empty inside, on iTunes today.  And the podcast with his wife, which is called My Wife Hates Me.  You want to hear another clip from the podcast?  Please.  Yeah.  I think the fight's over at this point.  This fight.  They fight on every fucking episode.  I don't know if we fight.  I heard the fourth episode is a really big fight, right? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Can't wait.  Is that online yet?  Yeah, it went on Monday.  All right.  I only listened to the first two so far.  So Rich calls Bob Kelly for tech support.  Oh, God.  No, that's on this podcast?  Jesus.  No, it's highlights from number three, because we ran out of stuff on number two there.  Okay, but number two.  Hold on.  Let me finish number two.  She comes in after this big blowout fight and sits down, and she's happy and like a psychopath. 
[01:48:30]  Her eyes are rolling around.  She's like a psychopath.  What's that?  All right.  Yeah, it's the same.  Then she sits down, and she might say the same about you.  Yeah, I know I'm fucked up, but she doesn't.  But she doesn't know she's fucked up.  I know I'm fucked up.  I know I have damage.  I'm not perfect, but here's the thing.  When she comes in and sits down, and like nothing happened, how do you deal with it?  You know what I'm saying.  Oh, I've seen girls do that constantly.  You know, it's fucking crazy.  I hope he's not been in that many relationships. 
[01:49:00]  Crazy girl.  He's been in like three.  Joe doesn't know, but me and you do.  We're players.  We know from history.  Sam is too young.  God.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people want me to ask you this, Rich.  What?  Can you guys ask Voss where the thing is?  Here's the thing.  And what is the thing?  What is the thing when you say here's the thing, and where is the thing?  Sounds like he's in a David Mamet play.  The fucking thing. 
[01:49:30]  Anybody?  Mamet?  No?  All right.  Why don't you take your intellect?  If you start talking about mammoths, then we'll look at you.  Now I understand why you don't have a muscle on your body.  You did a lot of reading growing up.  You know, he wrote Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.  Oh, I know.  I heard that.  American Buffalo.  I just saw Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.  I saw the movie.  Was that a cousin?  He wrote the movie.  But you read the book.  It's a play, Opie.  Yeah, it's a play.  It's a play.  American Buffalo.  It's the Bobby Kelly story. 
[01:50:00]  God damn.  That fucking douchebag is in Aruba right now.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's filling in for one of the islands.  I guarantee he's walking along the sand with a metal detector and fucking head speakers  trying to find some gold.  Okay?  I like head speakers.  Or earbuds.  Not head speakers.  What the fuck is a head?  That's my new catch. 
[01:50:30]  All right, listen.  Here's a...  All right, so then we give you a little taste of episode.  Rich, that's what we do.  What?  Think she's a liberal?  Who?  Carol King?  Oh, is that Carol King?  No.  That's Carol King.  Is it?  Oh, it is.  Wow.  She looks terrible.  No, for her age.  I think she looks good.  She's got like witchy poo hair.  When you're president and when you're hated by so many people just because you're who you  are, I think that's a big problem.  You fucking lip cunt.  Look, see?  In Northern California.  Two seconds we potter up.  Because he's hated for who he is. 
[01:51:00]  No, he's hated because his fucking policies stink.  And they're horrible for this country.  Oh, God, the excuse.  The excuse.  Understood.  God damn.  I really enjoy watching Anthony scream like a fucking malicious psychopath as he eats turkey  chili.  I got turkey chili flying out of my mouth.  He's holding the turkey chili like it's a wine goblin.  I want to go, shut the fuck up.  I want the CVS blood pressure machine in here.  We actually did once, remember?  I know.  I want that machine, though, where you just pop the quarters in. 
[01:51:30]  Can we get one of those?  Can we steal one of those?  I don't see why not.  No, but why is everybody so brainwashed?  You know, here's the deal.  Can you believe that?  Here's the deal.  He's hated because of, you know, oh, because he's a black guy.  Really?  Carole King?  No, and here's the deal with people.  Oh, trickish chili on my mic.  More importantly, more importantly, to stay on track, Stephen S. from Bay Show writes,  Good morning, Ope.  I just tuned in.  Does Still Empty Inside refer to Voss's head?  No. 
[01:52:00]  Steve.  Is that the guy with the sideburns that makes an appearance every now and then?  He kind of looks like Elvis a little bit.  Oh, okay.  Got the Elvis thing happening with his sideburns.  That's original.  I liked it.  Stephen S.  I thought it was pretty good.  Because he had hair.  That's why you liked it.  Stephen S. is a good writer.  What does that mean?  He's a good writer.  He's a good writer.  He's a good writer?  Yeah, he's a good writer.  Who's he written for?  Our show.  For your message board?  He's a good message board writer?  That's two bombs in a row.  Yeah, I don't think he's a message board writer.  We took over Japan like that. 
[01:52:30]  Listen, here's more another taste of Voss and Bonnie, my wife hates me podcast.  Hello?  When the mic is blinking, that means it's not on.  When it's not blinking, that means it is on, right?  You're kidding me.  No, I'm not kidding you.  We forgot.  Yeah, he's talking to Bob Kelly because he's obsessed if it's actually recording.  This happens a lot during the podcast.  Both of us.  What do you got, two cans and a string? 
[01:53:00]  Oh, there we go.  What?  No, we're just asking.  We want to make sure we don't want to tape it.  You were the one who told us to do this podcast, okay?  So if you didn't think this was going to happen when you were talking to Rich Voss, then you  don't know Rich Voss.  Okay.  You can't take us on.  You're supposed to be the tech guy, though.  Who, Rich?  I'm not the tech...  Oh, I think it's working because every time he yells, it goes up.  Delane?  Hey.  You said that you knew you were the tech guy.  Bonnie wasn't the tech person. 
[01:53:30]  Okay.  Well, listen.  We think it's working, so we're just going to have to cut you loose.  I think it's working.  Wait a minute.  I'm not on your podcast right now, am I?  We don't know how it gets edited.  We don't know.  We just send it.  We don't know what happens.  Once it leaves our house, it dangles in the air.  We've never listened to it.  If I listen...  If you can just call me on the phone while you're doing a podcast without telling me you're  doing a fucking podcast.  First of all, don't act like this is some major radio show. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, you're on the air.  Second of all, okay, we were sure we were doing it because we didn't know Phil was recording.  Can I just say something, Bobby Kelly?  You told us, like, oh, your podcast is doing so well.  I got five new followers on Twitter.  It's bullshit.  And they're O&A fans, so that's really only two and a half followers.  I didn't say people liked you, Bobby.  Oh.  I think your podcast was doing well.  She's so funny.  Isn't it cute at the evolution of a little radio show?  It really is adorable. 
[01:54:30]  I got to give it to him.  She's so funny, man.  I got to give it to him.  You don't put that out live, though, huh?  You record it and then send it out?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Do it live?  I don't know.  Eventually, you guys should go live.  Hangs up on Bobby.  DeRosa texts Rich here, and Voss praises himself.  I've been talking to myself at least five different times a day, literally repeating ten speakers. 
[01:55:00]  Head speakers.  Put your head speakers on.  Yeah.  I hung up on him.  Here's the deal.  We say who makes fun of us, right?  Yes.  I make fun of you.  We don't let Bobby Kelly make fun of you.  Who is he?  He's lucky that we would call him in the middle of the night to let us know if our microphone is on.  Yeah.  He's lucky.  There was at least another person we could have called.  Who?  I don't know a lot of people that have a microphone like this. 
[01:55:30]  At least maybe would have known.  What has a microphone like this?  Okay.  Here's what's why DeRosa texts me.  Head speakers.  What's this?  Everybody's saying head speakers.  What's the big deal?  Because they're loving that you're, you know what it is?  Like, people kind of think, oh, it's a character, but then you just keep doing it.  You keep doing these dumb things and saying these dumb things, and then they get a kick  out of it because it reinforces it's not, that is really who he is. 
[01:56:00]  I fucking killed on stage this week.  I'm, like, at the top of my game on stage.  I'm a comedian.  I get on fucking stage.  Let me tell you something.  I did an hour and 20.  While you're doing this part, I'm going to go to the bathroom, okay?  No, you can't go to the bathroom and do it on this.  Why don't you talk about how well you do?  I did already.  Just talk about how great you are.  Just talk about how great you are.  You can't just go to the bathroom.  Pretend we're on our first date.  Remember when you talked about how great you are?  Oh. 
[01:56:30]  Where'd you guys go on your first date?  Pizza parlor.  Really?  Pizza parlor.  Wait, on your first date, you were telling her how great you are?  Pizza parlor.  She was asking me about me.  I was in the highland of my career.  Idiot.  Parlor bear.  Yeah, she's got insecurities, too, though.  Huh?  She's got insecurities, too.  Why?  I'm not saying why.  Well, because I'm saying that I do well on stage, and she fucking maybe, the night  was doing the taping, maybe she had a bad set.  But at this point, you should understand, you just do well on stage.  You don't have to keep telling people. 
[01:57:00]  You really have to keep her down with her comedy, I think.  More so, even though.  Her comedy's great, though.  You can't.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  But you're always saying how much better you are.  Well, we're different.  She's a great writer, believe you me.  She could write a fucking treatment, anything.  The thing is, she doesn't know people.  Like, we did a gig last week.  It was a small thing.  She doesn't know how to read people.  She's a little naive.  Well, like, she can't go up there.  Okay, if you're going to trash the host for giving you a bad intro, you do it when you 
[01:57:30]  get on stage.  You don't do it from the side of the stage, because they already like the host.  So she's yelling at him, and they're going, who's this fucking bitch?  Oh.  So you've got to go up there, establish who you are, and then trash.  Who the fuck?  You know what I mean?  Teaching her a little something.  We were doing a show in Miami, and there's a guy in the front row, and she keeps calling  him gay, homo, this and that.  You know?  And it's funny, this and that, but she's really fucking...  Did your kids have a fucking Don Johnson while you were down there?  So, yeah, what other 80 stars is Bonnie banging? 
[01:58:00]  Norman Fell.  I saw you with Norman Fell.  I saw you with the guy that played Phil Drummond.  I saw him.  So I come out on stage, and I go, who's the gay guy?  And the guy, and it's this guy in the front row, and he has LK tattooed on his fucking  hand.  And, you know, he's a Latin king. 
[01:58:30]  Okay?  You know, he has spiderwebs on his elbows, which means he did time.  So she doesn't really know.  She's not from that type of life where she knows people.  Oh, boy.  She's a great comic, but she doesn't know the psychology of people like I do.  I'm like a psychologist besides a profiler.  A profiler and a psychologist.  Yeah, I am.  Besides the stupidity, I'm like a psychologist.  Like a psychologist.  You could ask me any question about the human behavior, and I could probably answer it. 
[01:59:00]  Okay.  Why do you think the way you do?  Because of my childhood and my upbringing.  Oh, no, no.  It brings it all back to reality.  It makes us all feel bad.  Give him a hug.  Just give him a hug.  Oh, Rich Hensley.  Don't like it.  Look at Rich Hensley.  Sam, give him a hug back.  Give him a hug back.  Yeah.  It's like a jellyfish grabbing me.  All right.  Here's the last track from the podcast.  I was actually trying to see if I could get you angry to show the people, the four people  listening, how volatile you really are. 
[01:59:30]  Do I have to explain what that word means to you?  Or you know that word?  Volatour means...  Volatour what?  Volatour means...  Volatour means...  Volatour.  Volatour means what?  Volatour.  Disgusting.  Mean.  I don't know what volatour means.  I'll be honest with you.  I don't.  But volatile...  Volatour.  Volatour.  I messed up.  It's easy to ire.  Oh, aren't you the fucking professor? 
[02:00:00]  Volatour.  I want it to piss you off.  Oh.  Stop asking for...  Like, you think you really want to have some tea and biscuits along with this fucking podcast?  Okay, listen.  Princess Bonnie?  Wow.  Princess Bonnie.  Princess Bonnie.  Because she knew a second grade level word like fucking volatile.  You called her a princess for that?  Oh, she said ire, too.  Huh?  She said ire.  Oh, you're right.  That is cunty.  It is.  I don't like that.  What's ire mean?  I don't know what that means. 
[02:00:30]  It's so funny.  It's just...  Something club owners don't do with you if you add an F in front of it.  I mean, H.  Ah, stupid.  Oh, shit.  You totally made it the opposite of what it was supposed to be.  God damn it, Rich.  That was going to be a good one.  You ruined it.  Damn it.  You got too excited.  You are such a volatour.  Oh, no.  I'm an ire.  You're an ire.  What does ire mean?  Huh?  What does ire mean?  I don't fucking know.  You don't think she had sex with Tom Wolpat, do you?  Who's that?  Oh, shit.  That's the other guy from the Dukes of Hazzard. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, boy.  Or Uncle Jesse.  Why don't you talk about how John...  Uncle Jesse, the guy that did cat scratch fever.  Hey, Bonnie, Bonnie, bend over the sink.  John.  Ging, ging, ging, ging, ging.  Why don't you talk about how John...  Well, them Duke boys were making pretty short work of her ass.  She went, all of a sudden...  Why don't you talk about how John Stamos stole your girlfriend?  Oh, shit.  I talked about this on the air many times.  Oh, you did?  When I used to live in Rochester, I was going out with this girl that might have liked...  You blowing your nose instead of picking it? 
[02:01:30]  And she went to New York and she hooked up with John Stamos.  And she was your girlfriend?  And that was the end of our...  Well, yeah.  Like a summer fling.  Was she hot?  Yeah, she was really hot.  Didn't that break your heart?  Yeah, it hurt a little bit.  My mom met John Stamos in Disney and got a picture with him and was all like...  How do you know that's all that happened?  Are you sure that's all that happened?  John Stamos is all over the place.  Are you sure that's all that happened?  I know.  I don't know.  But that's the...  More power to mom if she fucked John Stamos. 
[02:02:00]  She went to New York for a weekend or whatever and she ended up hooking up with him and that  was it for me, man.  And then I don't know what...  I don't know what ended up happening.  John Stamos does not get that picture.  He was blacky at the time in a soap opera.  It was before he became...  General Hospital.  Was it General Hospital?  Oh, shit.  Those are the years I watched, my friend.  Yeah, so it was before he became John fucking Stamos.  But I mean...  But he was on his way.  I mean, how retarded good-looking must that guy have been when he was on the...  Before...  I mean, he was a fucking stallion on Full House. 
[02:02:30]  I can't imagine what he looked like when he was 21.  When he was in General Hospital, it was pretty much the definitive soap opera heartthrob.  All those magazines, he was the cover guy for all of them.  And before I get sued by everyone, I just assumed they had to have hooked up.  Oh, yeah?  Pretty obvious to me.  I don't know for sure.  I don't know for sure.  I mean, but I gotta say, looking at these pictures of John Stamos, Rich, I see the physical  similarities between the two of you.  I don't think you have anything to worry about here.  Is that the blacky years? 
[02:03:00]  Probably, yeah.  Of course he blew me off.  Of course.  She could fuck that guy.  Of course, dude.  She looks like...  Why?  He has a horrible body.  Or Spuds Buckley.  Spuds Buckley came after me.  He looks like Rick Perry without the Jewiness.  Nothing that matters, bud.  That's a hell of a description.  No.  Look at him.  Look at...  That fucking guy now is still...  Jesus Christ, dude.  What happened?  Look at that guy.  All right. 
[02:03:30]  Relax, Joe.  Look at him.  Huh?  Look at him now.  Look at him right there.  I'm excited.  I see it.  I'm excited.  I'm worked up.  I'm hot and bothered, even.  He's a fucking...  God damn jealous of that fuck.  God damn.  That's what he looks like now?  You're jealous of the elephant man.  Oh.  Oh.  The elephant man.  Yeah.  I know.  That was the only one I could come up with.  Just because you talk like him, you don't got to bring him up.  Good.  Look at Stamos.  God damn it.  Look at that fucking... 
[02:04:00]  Oh, gruff.  Yeah.  That's a good looking man.  You hate that?  It is.  You know what, Rich?  I take back everything I said.  You really should be worried.  I know.  Look at him.  Look at this guy.  He'll just hypnotize a girl in a fucking...  I know.  He's a 10.  I'm gay.  I mean, I'm not gay.  Oh, what?  I'm gay.  I mean, I'm not gay.  Rich.  Oh, you know what?  I'd like to see him get up on a stage.  What's that?  I'd like to see him get up on a stage and make people laugh.  Yeah.  Well, stop bringing up stuff Rich can't do either. 
[02:04:30]  I had one in my pocket, but that works.  Can't set up my own jokes.  Oh, Rich.  Bonnie loves you, and I don't think she's cheating.  I don't care about that.  I'm just curious about me on stage.  There's a 98% chance she's not cheating on you.  I'd say 98%.  It has to be 100 in his mind, though.  That's why I said 98.  I know.  I know.  You just killed him.  Look at it right there.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  Jesus Christ.  How much fucking pussy did that see?  Jesus Christ.  If you wear that little half sweater.  Jesus Christ.  I'm going to get one of those with my belly sticking out.  Yeah, just start dressing like John Stamos.  That's what I'll do from the 80s.  That'll work for you.  We do have to get to the bottom of something.  Yes.  Or the top of something, as they are.  What do you got, buddy?  You know where I'm going?  What do you got, buddy?  Well, someone came in to work today, right? 
[02:05:30]  And it's very chilly out.  Agreed?  But it's not that cold in here.  It's pretty nice.  So we all take our respective jackets off and whatnot.  And, well, one person is wearing his jacket.  Not only his jacket, but a thick wool cap that is pulled down to hide every bit of hair on his head.  Right.  This person, E to the R. 
[02:06:00]  Sexy!  Sexy.  This is the kind of hat you would wear at Killington.  Now, anytime he's ever done this, it's because he has done something to his hair that he doesn't want anybody to see.  And now, look, he looks just like Louis C.K.  How did that happen?  Wow.  E-Rock has changed himself into Louis C.K., apparently.  Hey, love.  Hi, Louis.  Oh, nice to see you.  We're just in the middle of E-Rock wearing that hat.  And it only means that he did something fucked up to his hair.  He's hiding something underneath that hat. 
[02:06:30]  He still thinks he's at that age and stuff where he can, like...  Where there's any qualitative difference between how he looks.  Yeah.  Yeah, like highlight his hair or something.  It's like, nah, nah.  E-Rock, move closer to the guys here.  Move your whole...  What did you do to your hair?  We don't know, but it's obvious.  Yeah, we don't know what he did.  He didn't even bring it up.  Sam is the instigator that came in and went,  Ah, guys, just want to let you know.  He's wearing a hat.  He has to take his hat off.  Sam's like the little busybody. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  He's got to be the little rat.  All right, let's see what we got.  I don't know what else Sam could be doing besides this.  Nah, I know.  I know.  He could be like a prison informant kind of a guy that winds up getting fucking killed.  That's it.  He'd have made a good one of those trustees in the fucking ghetto over there.  You know what, actually?  My sister works for a software company, and she says it's the whole place.  No one's working.  Everyone's just trying to fuck each other.  Just fuck each other?  I mean, you know, like trying to get each other fired.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get each other fired.  It's all anybody's ever...  There's barely any software going on at all.  I don't know.  That's great. 
[02:07:30]  Did you see the Apple documentary?  They did a documentary about Apple, but it was all ex-Apple employees,  and they're like...  There's one guy who's like,  Everybody thinks Apple's all cute with their quirky little commercials.  He's like,  It is the most cutthroat fucking evil.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  It has to be to be that successful.  I'm going to calm down and let the headliners talk.  Oh, damn.  Also, with his hair could be...  Mike Welts is coming in.  He also...  Whoa, got me there.  All right, Greg.  You shouldn't have pluralized it.  You shouldn't have pluralized it.  Don't quit fucking teaming up with Joe, okay? 
[02:08:00]  All right, let's go.  Let's get this all over.  Because we got Louis C.K. in the studio.  Well, explain.  I haven't done anything to my hair in many, many years.  Oh, God, this is going to be really uncomfortable for everybody.  Did you say Orr's body?  I thought that, you know,  since it went over so well after my last vacation using Sun-In.  You used Sun-In and had highlights in your hair.  So I figured I'd go all in and do a complete change.  Oh, my God.  We're going to be so uncomfortable in here. 
[02:08:30]  What is he doing?  Do you want to take a guess or something?  I'll let the Peltog people see this, too.  I pray it's at least blonde.  I think he may have shaved it.  What do you think?  No, it's winter.  I think he dyed it.  It looks shaved because I don't see a lot of lumpiness.  Yeah, a lot of lumps.  I think he fucking dyed it.  I think he fucking went to see Billy Burr or something,  dyed his hair red.  Watch.  It's going to be right here.  Let's get this over with.  I think it's something with a razor.  Can we bet on this? 
[02:09:00]  No.  Cut or color?  Let's fucking see it.  Is it a cut and color?  Let's stretch this shit out.  It might be on the sides more shaved.  What is he?  1980s?  Like kid in play?  It's got a lightning bolt, you know?  All right.  Iraq, let's unveil this.  Okay.  Let's see.  Oh, no.  It's Richie Rich.  Oh, he looks like in Fargo with the guy that fucking, he's the guy in Fargo that shot Buscemi in the back.  We go through Pancakes house. 
[02:09:30]  Jesus.  We go through Pancakes, you know.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, like Pancakes.  What was that product called?  Come in, you fucking queer.  Dude, that is.  What are you doing, man?  That's fucking blondie, blonde hair.  That's gay porn.  That's gay porn hair, right?  That's the dude from Fight Club.  Oh, man.  Yeah, the dude from Fight Club.  That's the dude from Fight Club, man.  It would be like Vanilla Ice if he was stung by a hornet's nest.  Hey, hey, not Slim Shady. 
[02:10:00]  What the fuck did you do?  It's Vanilla Ice Box.  Oh, no.  Oh, you're out.  What did you do?  What the fuck is rolling on?  Dennis the cunt.  Oh, that's awful.  He looks like Shane Reynolds when he plays.  Yeah.  In the playoffs.  Roland, grab a mic.  What do you think?  That's bad. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, man.  Roland's loving this.  I'm sad.  You shouldn't have done that, man.  What are you doing?  I'm not going to.  I think it looks good.  When I had it done, it was pure white.  And then over the two days.  Well, it's not much better.  It's not much better.  Someone goes, wow, Billy Idol got fat.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to take a picture of this.  This is what it used to be.  Like five days ago, this is what it looked like. 
[02:11:00]  What do you mean five days ago?  Where have we been?  All right.  It's whiter, but it looks the same.  It's horrible.  Man, what did you do?  That is really, really blonde.  How old are you?  What is part of a person's life does he do shit like that?  You live alone, right?  No.  I'm married.  You're married?  Yeah.  Why don't you do your eyebrows so it matches a little?  Okay, I kind of get it.  What did you do?  Are you married?  Why not? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, just fuck it.  Right, fuck you on your forehead in the morning.  It hasn't been 20 years.  You just got married.  That doesn't take a while.  That is really bright.  It's gelled already.  It's a bright blonde, man.  How old are you?  Seriously.  33.  He's just like, oh, God.  I kind of like it.  Can we ask why?  I had talked for a while.  Sam knows this on his show that I wanted to recolor my hair again. 
[02:12:00]  I haven't done it in so many years, but this is going to be like a one and done.  No.  You'll do it again.  I'm not going to continue coloring it.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Once is enough.  I think I figured it out.  Because you look at that, and it takes away from you looking at the rest of him.  You think that's it?  Yeah.  It's diverting attention.  Does the wife like it?  I don't remember what he looked like before, really.  His hair really dark.  His hair was just nothing, right?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That's his insides.  What did your wife say? 
[02:12:30]  She, it took her a little while, but she likes it.  That means she hates it.  Oh, she likes it.  But she has no choice.  She's married to you.  I went to her hairstylist and had it done.  Yeah.  I got to admit, you know, you went to his hairstylist?  Hers, yes.  Oh, man.  That's much worse.  This is like something you do in the sink because you're in a weird mood.  If you actually went and got foil in your hair and read a fucking Glamour magazine, it's a...  Jesus.  That's a lot.  With a cotton between his toes.  That's because he wanted to be on the air.  Jesus Christ.  I know.  And it gets on the air a lot. 
[02:13:00]  That's the strange part, man.  Hey, Dan, do you see this?  Oh.  Yeah.  I got to admit, as I stare, it does kind of look better.  I kind of, yeah.  The more I look at it, the more I'm like, yeah, it kind of doesn't look better.  It just looks like one of those if he was wanted and they did one of those variety headshots  or different ways he might look.  Yeah.  And you, you're too fucking blonde! 
[02:13:30]  That's a fight club.  Yeah, it is.  Looks like the fight club kid.  All right.  Well, here we are.  Oh, it's Pony Boy.  Well, that's hilarious.  Oh, no.  Did your friend die in a fire?  Stay fat, Pony Boy.  Stay fat.  Stay golden arches.  I think Eric's sad. 
[02:14:00]  Hey, uh, he's a stable boy.  Why is he sad?  Oh, you can see him in his eyes.  He's not smiling at all.  Jeremy's standing at a fucking microphone saying, please, please shit all over me.  I mean, what the fuck?  It's like feeling bad for your toilet.  I'm sorry, did I shit in you?  I should have shit in the sink.  Giving you a break for the day.  Oh, my God.  Are you sad, E-Rock?  No.  It goes with his new name, Sexy.  Sexy? 
[02:14:30]  He's taking this really seriously, this sexy thing.  You get your pubes done?  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  When you wear your hat like that, you look like Robin Williams and Popeye with the fucking...  With a little blonde hair in there.  Oh, I got fetsk.  I loves me creamed spinach.  We could see.  All right, well, there's the big reveal.  I can imagine he looks like a professional wrestler now.  Yeah, he's going for the wrestling thing. 
[02:15:00]  Bulk Hogan, maybe?  Bulk Hogan.  It's still real to me.  What you need to see is when he gets sweaty, if he exerts himself and the face turns red,  that's what that's supposed to look like.  Oh, yeah.  The red face and the blonde, bleach blonde.  That's the porn look.  Yeah.  Yeah, the money shot look.  Yeah.  That does look porn star-ish.  Yeah.  Did you think for two seconds that it might look a little gay?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This goes with a clean-shaven cock and balls. 
[02:15:30]  That's what this goes with.  And, you know, body, like, you spray on tan.  Yeah.  That would look good on the beach.  People will walk by and go, look at that sand dune with blonde hair.  Okay, they're not all good.  I got four good ones.  That was a little long, too.  Four out of five years in the hall of a thing.  It's pretty lengthy.  That was pretty bad.  That sand dune.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  Maybe you're laying on the beach and somebody walks by and goes, look at that cock and balls  with blonde hair.  What would a beach have to do with that, Rich? 
[02:16:00]  Enough about the beach.  All right.  I'm just throwing them out, you know, whatever sticks.  I'm buried down.  All right.  There you go.  We do have to take a break because we have holiday live reads.  We're not going over this again, but I guarantee what we did with the podcast, he would have  been on my side.  What happened?  All right.  We'll explain next.  No, no.  We don't want to do it next.  Well, you brought it up, so now we have to.  He's curious, so we'll do a short version of it next.  CD on iTunes. 
[02:16:30]  Pick it up today.  I'm not fucking around.  Fuck you.  Louis CK.com news special.  Oh, my gosh.  I saw that.  Yeah, I want to talk.  We're going to talk about that next.  I saw that.

A big discount, man.  Yeah.  Save like eight bucks on the ticket.  Yeah.  $10 to see Joe DeRosa if you use that promo code.  And then, of course, we move on to Louis C.K., who's setting the world on fire with this fucking Live at the Beacon thing, man.  Every comic is going to do this. 
[02:18:00]  It's doing pretty good, I think.  It is, right?  I'm not telling anybody how much I'm making.  Right, right.  I don't want to know so bad.  Don't say it.  Not a peep.  Well, you're hiding it well with your clothing.  Yes.  I know.  Well, that's smart.  That's how you do this shit.  Keep the money.  No, I'm like one of those beggars that stands outside, and you know he's got a Mercedes somewhere.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what I'm doing.  The news follows them to their apartment.  Let me say this.  When I learned that Louis was doing this, I'm like, holy fuck, every comic in America is going to do this.  This is brilliant.  It's the way to do this, you know, to move forward. 
[02:18:30]  Well, the special has to be good.  Obviously.  Well, that's true.  I mean, I have a lot of skill sets that help me do this.  I produced it and directed it myself.  I know how to put something like this together.  Right.  And the company that I have that does my show, I just had them.  We just did.  Accomplished too much at once.  Right.  They're like, don't just have them buy it.  Tell them about 50 other things.  Right.  Get their email address, all this, make them join, like force all this shit down your throat. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  And then they jacked the price up.  Right.  So I made it five bucks.  And you don't like, every detail we went through with me and the website guy, like where it  says opt in to the email ad, like because your choice, do you want to get emails or not?  Yes is always pre-clicked for you.  But we pre-clip no.  Oh.  It says, no, leave me alone forever, you fat idiot.  That's the choice.  Yeah, that's good.  And that's clicked.  So you have to click yes. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, very good.  Most people do.  Oh, you're not going to get a...  Like 70% of the people click.  Oh, that's pretty good.  And I was reading an article on, you know, you're telling people, don't fucking steal this  thing.  Yeah, also the file, the video is easy to steal because it's nothing, there's nothing on it.  Right.  It's like something I, you know, I just put it out of my computer and there it is.  Yeah, yeah.  You're very trusting.  There's no DRM on it.  There's no anti-piracy.  There's no regional.  You can get it in anywhere in the world.  It's...  Burn it on a DVD.  But why do you do that?  It's the honor system.  Why do you do that?  Just to make it even easier?  To make it a better product. 
[02:20:00]  It's like, you know, if you made like a nice, I don't know, product, like, you know, a nice  waffle iron and then you have a big lock on it.  But don't use it.  It's like the no bouncer at the bar mentality.  Yeah, they know it's a nice place.  No, I get it.  But the other side of that, and I want Louis to explain, is that people can now just steal  it and fucking do all sorts of shit with you.  They can, and all I did was ask them not to.  I know.  I just said, please don't do that.  I'm just a guy.  Right.  And it's five bucks.  It's five dollars. 
[02:20:30]  For fuck's sake.  I closed the gap from stealing to honesty to be so small.  Yes.  Right.  But are they listening to you and they're not stealing it, right?  Well.  So far?  There is one guy that put it up on torrent and he's, here's, I learned so much from this  already.  This guy put it up on torrent and he's getting hammered by people saying, like some people  are saying this has, this has bad quality, like as a, and it's not true.  Oh, so they're just, yeah.  They're trying to stop him.  And he wrote this explanation saying, well, you know, Hey, you got to understand, I'm 
[02:21:00]  really sorry.  Like I feel kind of bad for doing this, but you know, if we don't have torrent, then we  can't afford anything.  And torrents help the artist.  The funny thing though, is that if it pains him at all, he's not stealing it.  He's making it available for stealing.  So if it pains him at all, why is it, why does he do it?  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  The reason he's doing it is because he has a bunch of videos and stuff.  He's got his own career.  So he's trying to promote, he's using my thing as a magnet.  That if, yeah, then people go to his thing and go to his thing and buy his stuff. 
[02:21:30]  And I'm sure if somebody pirated his thing, he'd be like, so that's actually the main,  I'm learning that the, one of the main reasons that people pirate stuff, like on YouTube,  when people post stuff, like when it first went up, like 20, there were 20 videos on YouTube  of it.  And they were all coming from the same guy who's selling stuff.  He's trying to draw people to his channel.  So people mostly use, it's not, it's very few people that are just like, geez, I really  can't afford it.  Right.  I got it.  They're using it to market their own shit.  That's right.  Yeah.  Most of the people that want, would have torrented it. 
[02:22:00]  Not, do you torrent?  No.  I don't know how to do it.  I got guys down the hall that just steal shit for me.  Yeah.  So there's.  And you know what we said earlier, Lou?  Yeah.  When, when an artist wants $50 for something like that, fuck it.  I'll steal it.  I'll be completely honest with you.  But when you're dropping the price to five bucks, then it's like, you know what?  I'm not going to steal for five bucks.  Five bucks for something that nobody has seen yet.  Right.  Like it's not a bargain bin at Walmart.  It's brand new stuff.  It's brand new.  Yep.  But you know when an artist is taking advantage of the consumer and then I, I swear to you, 
[02:22:30]  I'll be honest, I don't feel guilty when I get a free copy here and there.  Well, it's generally not the artist.  It's the, it's, it's true.  It's the, it's a corporation around the world.  This is what, I was talking about this on Reddit, this thing that I only discovered  exists yesterday and I was on it for like a day.  Smut on that one too.  Yeah.  Mmm.  Reddit, Reddit gets your shit to go viral though.  Yes.  But somebody was asking me about the piracy thing and, and, um, why it's okay when people  feel like it's okay to steal. 
[02:23:00]  I read, I read this thing that Noam Chomsky said, a very smart, liberal asshole guy.  I'm just saying asshole for your benefit.  Thank you.  Because I think he's a great guy.  But, uh, he said that, uh, corporations are like, um, superhuman.  They're, they're like, because they never die.  They're immortal and they can't be put in jail.  Uh, they can't be murdered.  They can't be hurt.  Uh, they can't be held accountable.  Uh, they can't, you know, all this stuff.  So that's what they get when they make a corporation.  But then the things they also have to deal with is nobody has any sympathy for you. 
[02:23:30]  Right.  Nobody likes you.  Nobody trusts you.  Uh, nobody feels empathy.  Like I should be nice to this.  It's a fucking corporation.  So if you want to make something that infallible, it's also going to be, you know, some people are going to, fuck you, I'm taking it.  Sure.  Yeah.  Fuck, if I can sell a lot of CDs, I'll become a corporation.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, that's all.  But to me also, I make enough, there's a level where I think that's enough money.  For me, personally, I can make that decision.  A corporation can't do that. 
[02:24:00]  They have, they, you literally, if you're the head of a company, you would go to jail for not fleecing the public.  Are you officially the first one to do this?  You have to be.  At this level, I think I am.  Yeah, of course.  As a comedian.  And I didn't mean to downplay it earlier, because you're right.  I mean, you've got to have, you've got to have a good act for this to work.  Because a lot of guys are going to try what you're doing and they're going to fail miserably.  Listen, the second I heard it, that my wife said, and she was reading, and Louie's doing this for $5.  Right.  I go, how can we do this with my CD for $4? 
[02:24:30]  You know, where they just click a button.  Yeah.  And I go, and then I just fucking did iTunes.  But it's fucking brilliant, because, I mean, we also.  Well, it's also smart, because you're not going to go to every market.  So now these people get a nice chance to see a really good Louis C.K. show.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  And you can't, because this material isn't ever going to be, I only did it for two months to get it ready.  And then I dumped it.  And now you're done with it.  So this is the only way you can really see it.  Exactly.  Only people, like, in Raleigh, North Carolina, and wherever the hell I went, Richmond, Virginia, those people saw it live.  Right.  And it's gone. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  It's fucking funny, man.  I'm on to other stuff.  I just saw it.  I was at the taping.  It's amazing.  Two nights ago.  Yeah.  Fucking hilarious.  That was a fun show.  Really good.  I mean, I did it now, because I thought I had the show to do it.  Right.  But it is sort of like, as far as anyone can do it, it's like Steve Martin's bit, where he goes,  I'm going to teach you how to get a million dollars and not pay taxes.  First, get a million dollars.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  Right.  So you have to, you know, but everybody can do it on some level. 
[02:25:30]  Getting it shot, most comedians don't know how to completely, you know, ground up.  But I saved an enormous amount by being able to do that myself.  And I still shot it on red cinematic cameras, and it still looks pretty good.  Looks great, yeah.  Yeah, but you're going to have guys just set up a dumb camera, you know, one shot.  Sure.  And do the exact same thing as you do.  Oh, they'll get, you know.  In their basement.  It's only five bucks.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Why do you complain?  It's only five.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, no, it's, it's. 
[02:26:00]  No, it was shot like an HBO special.  Simple as that.  Yeah, so it's, how many cameras?  Three?  Six cameras.  Holy.  It's amazing.  That's just the other way they say money.  I've had six cameras in my whole life.  Usually you need a whole truck, and you need a director to switch between the cameras.  But because I know how to do this stuff, I just shot it on six different cards.  The cameras shoot onto cards.  Yeah.  Dumped the cards onto my computer at home, and then I edited it.  Then you just fucking pull everything up and put it together.  That replaced, that literally saved me about $100,000. 
[02:26:30]  It would have been awkward, you being on stage, going, go to three.  All right.  Bring up five.  Go to five.  Take two.  He would probably be able to pull that off.  That's the scary part.  As he's doing his show.  Louie's the only, literally, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass, you're the only  guy at your level in this business that's sort of showing.  Well, yeah, and showing us the way that it can be done, because everybody doing the kind  of shit that Louie's doing right now is doing, I'm not saying the special idea, I'm just 
[02:27:00]  saying the, I'm going to be a one-stop shop.  It's all guys trying to work our way up and punch up to where you're at, and it's so fucking  refreshing to see a guy at your level go, fuck the labels, fuck the whatever.  I'm going to just do this myself.  Well, it is a better road for you guys, for young guys.  It's a better way to go.  It's nice to see.  Because otherwise, you're waiting for some fucking company to give you permission to  have an audience, and they decide how you do it.  They have the wrong instincts, too.  Like, some people think, well, they're led by greed, so they make you do something really 
[02:27:30]  broad, a broad appeal.  Well, were that they would.  Like, if only these people were, like, at least greedy and smart, but they just don't  know.  They don't understand what people want.  And also, let's not forget.  They don't know what fucking funny is, especially.  No, no.  And let's not forget, they're also going to edit your shit and take out stuff you really  want in there.  Yes.  Because you know it works.  The six cameras, well, I don't understand, because I didn't see it.  My wife watched Billy's special, right? 
[02:28:00]  And it was just him with no audience shots.  So you can do that when you don't need six cameras, it's just to do you with no audience  shots, right?  No.  Well, you need the different angles to keep the thing moving, so you have cutting off  six cameras.  And also, there's a movement.  Stop trying to figure out how to do this cheaper for yourself.  Thank you.  The Jew is trying to figure out how you can do it with two cameras.  By the way, you could go and get, if you get whatever, there's probably somewhere that  you can fill a decent room twice.  You need to do two.  Of course.  This is how you do it.  Whatever town you are the most popular in. 
[02:28:30]  Poughkeepsie?  You stay.  Sure.  On Wednesday.  By the way, there's a little theater in Poughkeepsie.  It's a beautiful old theater.  There's a Terry town.  There's an opera house.  Okay.  So you go to one of these towns.  You stay away from it for a year while you develop the material.  And then you book it for two shows.  And you fill them up.  Not with Comedy Central.  It actually pays to have an audience there.  And they're just morons that they pay to be there.  They're not your audience.  I've been to a million of those.  And they're lining up because it's a free comedy show. 
[02:29:00]  And it's like, I've never seen any of these people in my life.  Don't tell me this.  Tell him.  You pay.  You pay.  You use the ticket money.  By the way, the only thing I did to pay for this thing was tell the jokes.  And you just got me excited because I've been to so many of these Comedy Central tapings.  And they don't give a fuck if it's Joe DeRose's audience.  They're looking for people that just look good.  So it's like, they've got to get the females.  They've got to get the Asians.  They've got to get the blacks.  They don't give a fuck if any of these people have ever heard of Joe DeRose. 
[02:29:30]  They put a lot of women in the audience because they want to get more women to watch Comedy Central.  And they sit there kind of grimacing.  Even on the camera shots.  They even use it in the footage of a woman looking up at a comic like, ew.  That's really helping.  And then they spend.  They light the fuck out of the room so you can see the audience.  And the problem with comedy and lighting, if you're in the dark, you laugh at anything.  Because you know you're anonymous.  But when you're lit up and everyone can see you, you're inhibited.  You don't laugh.  You're going to choose what you feel like laughing at. 
[02:30:00]  And the other thing is then they take probably close to an hour moving everybody around.  So it's the perfect audience.  And I feel bad for you guys.  I'm like, this isn't Joe's audience, Rich's audience, whatever.  No, so on this show we just filled it up, 2,500 people.  My people who paid money to see the show.  And that money paid for the production.  The ticket money paid for everything.  Did they know you were filming for a special?  When I put it on sale, they didn't.  I don't even know if we didn't make a thing out of it.  We didn't have a warm-up guy go, listen, you really got to go crazy when he comes out. 
[02:30:30]  Because otherwise it'll be sad.  There's no warm-up guy.  I didn't even have an opener.  I just walked out on stage before people were done sitting.  I was in the audience and all of a sudden Lou just walks out and he goes, no, this is it.  The show's starting.  People are like, what?  I'm still getting my beer.  No, this is it.  I'm starting right now.  When you're doing comedy on the road, the host thinks that he's got to get the crowd all crazy.  It's not a fucking rodeo.  No, it doesn't make them a better audience.  Just even in a club. 
[02:31:00]  Hey, you ready for your hair?  Look, just say.  I hate when I'm told that we didn't cheer good enough the first time.  Hey, you ready to laugh tonight?  Yeah, okay, yeah.  I hate when I said it.  Don't fucking try to pull.  It's backwards.  You're supposed to entertain me so much that I go crazy.  Right.  You feel exhausted.  I'm supposed to go so crazy that you entertain me.  You feel exhausted before the comic even comes out.  I feel exhausted.  But that's what's so great, again, about seeing a guy in your position do this. 
[02:31:30]  Because, like what Opie was saying about the standard special audiences, they'll put somebody  like me on a special and they'll pay the audience and you'll be king for a day.  It doesn't fucking do anything.  No, it doesn't.  It does nothing.  Fuck would you know that?  And it's like, I was just at a club this weekend and I'm standing in the back and they go,  give it up for your headliner, Joe DeRosa.  And the 30% applause of people that actually knew who I was.  And I'm literally screaming, they don't give a shit.  I hate when they do that during the intros. 
[02:32:00]  Here's the other thing with intros, too.  You don't, listen, enough with the credit.  Nobody gives a fuck.  They want you to be funny.  Oh, where they've been seen.  Well, you might have recognized, well.  I like the ones that are forever ago.  For Joe, you'll say you might recognize him if you were in the lobby before the show.  He's done the Tonight Show with Jack Parr.  How do you give a fuck?  How about sitting in Caroline's and a comic is using us in their credits and I'm looking  up the stage like, maybe we mentioned his name once. 
[02:32:30]  I don't know this guy.  And I'm a credit now.  How much better your credits if they're using you?  As far as the people not stealing and stuff, part of it is like an ongoing thing because  I'm going to keep selling stuff this way.  And when I go on tour next, I'm going to try to sell the tickets through my website.  So you need the help of your audience because you're basically telling them, look, if you  help me out, I can do more of these.  Then I can bring everything down.  And that'll make them attack, which I like.  Because last time I toured, what I made on a month of touring to get up to this thing, 
[02:33:00]  I was surprised.  I didn't know I was making that much.  And I'm looking at what my tickets are.  I always keep them low.  Yeah.  I'm making enough money.  I don't need to make per show.  I don't need to make more money.  So to me, the only direction for things to go for me is for the audience to pay less.  The less they can pay, the better.  Right.  Because I'm fucking fine.  So I'm looking at everything.  The two things that are killing the audience are the ticket services, premium charges, and  the scalpers. 
[02:33:30]  When did you...  I got to...  Sorry to interrupt.  I got to ask you because you said it.  When did you become fine?  Because we watched it happen.  You exploded, my friend.  Well, my version, I get to decide when I'm fine.  So I'm not rich.  I'm not.  But I'm supporting myself at a level that I like.  And when I go on the road, I'm able to travel comfortably.  But I don't have a fortune or a savings.  But it went from like...  You had a two-year period where it just exploded, right?  Yeah.  The last couple of years have been really good, especially this year. 
[02:34:00]  I like how you're saying the special, too, that like, hey, this is going to be over  real soon.  Just, you know, I'm not you.  I'm not like you.  I'm not like you at all anymore.  That's hilarious.  But when this, the way I look at it, the thing I'm obsessing now with is keep getting  the price down.  Because also that, like, Ticketmaster, if I put a ticket on sale for $30, like, I could  probably get like $50 ticket in a lot of markets or more.  A lot of people, Kathy Griffin charges $50 in some place. 
[02:34:30]  Like, I always look at those things and try to stay under her.  Like, I try to stay somewhat under tickets of somebody I could probably pay, charge more  than.  That's my goal.  But here's what happens.  First of all, like, my ticket's $30.  Ticketmaster makes it up to, like, sometimes $55.  Like, it's almost twice as much.  And then if I drop the tickets too low, they get bought by StubHub in larger bulk because  it's a cheaper investment.  So the fans end up paying more money. 
[02:35:00]  And I don't, I just, when I buy a Ticketmaster ticket and there's a StubHub ad on the back  of it, there's just no way these people aren't fucking helping each other.  That, like, there's got to be some synergy between those companies so that really the  same people are getting the money.  So this, next time I tour, I want, I'm going to not use, I'm going to try not to use ticket  services and sell the tickets the same way I'm selling this DVD.  Fucking pilot fish.  And drop the price down to, like, fucking $20. 
[02:35:30]  Well, here.  And then you'll have to go to the theater to get the tickets.  No fucking, so it'll be impossible to scalp.  Aren't a lot of the theaters in cahoots with, uh...  They all are.  Some places are Ticketmaster-only buildings.  Right.  Wow.  And when I, when I'm in a city like that, that has that, I'll have to do another, you  know?  Like, if I'm in a city, I can't, I won't be able to play the 3,000-seat theater.  If it's a Ticketmaster room, I'll have to pay it, play the 1,500 twice.  It's like Eddie Vedder, dude.  Are you worried about being blackballed, though? 
[02:36:00]  Uh, somehow.  All of it scares the shit out of me, but it's exciting at 44 that I get to be scared.  It's a good feeling.  At that level.  And this thing, I'm a lot.  At that level, you can't black.  At that level, he can always work somewhere and make money.  Well, I don't know what other connections they have, though.  Also, the thing I just put up, this DVD, I'm creating a place now.  Yeah.  And so, and I've got a list of people.  They all opted in, because I gave them a choice. 
[02:36:30]  And so, when I go on the road, I can tell people where I'm going.  And if they come to my website, then anybody who's buying the video for five bucks now is  investing in the ability.  And it's only, look, at the bottom, it's just me telling jokes.  So, it's not like I'm fucking giving them anything else.  You're not going to get, like, a DVD player.  It's just my next joke.  It's a bar.  But next time I go on the road, I will be able to charge.  If I created this framework, it'll give me a place.  Now, with the video, I was able to avoid AMC Records and Warner Brothers and Comedy Central and all this stuff. 
[02:37:00]  So, maybe I can step aside from Ticketmaster.  It's hard.  It's not easy to do.  Are you going to get the same audience watching it?  I think so.  In numbers, I mean, numbers.  You mean watching this one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Compared to what you've done with HBO and Comedy Central.  You know, comedy specials don't have a great place to be.  There's thousands of them on Comedy Central, and they're just on.  And most people watching them are, you know, in jail, or they can't get it. 
[02:37:30]  They're fucking, they don't have, they didn't give them a remote.  It means nothing anymore.  It's just somebody in front of a curtain.  My fucking mailman doing it.  Here's the thing.  If you're a big Louis C.K. fan, here's the thing.  My second CD, Live in Philly, let me just tell you, Louis C.K. took the picture of the cover.  The cover of my second CD, Louis C.K. took it.  It bothers me that he's slapping the plug-in under the guise of a joke.  No, it's smart.  I know. 
[02:38:00]  Shut up.  I don't even show the CD anymore.  It's just constant.  Shut up.  Okay, you're plugging a Wednesday and a Sunday.  I got three CDs to put in three kids.  As you slam my Wednesday, in Minneapolis this week, I swear to God, after the first show  on a Wednesday, some guy came up to me and he goes, let me tell you something, DeRosa.  On a Wednesday night, you're better than that piece of shit Voss on a Saturday night.  Oh, shit.  I probably went there, Rich.  I wasn't going to say that.  I don't care.  I probably smashed him.  You went there, Rich.  It doesn't matter.  I probably smashed a guy and he was fat and you guys got along. 
[02:38:30]  It was a skinny guy.  It was John Stamos that said it.  Oh, fuck.  Fuckin' John Stamos.  So, Louie's new special, Live at the Beacon, available to stream or download for $5 at  louisck.com.  I think we have bumped it to three times for people that have any technical problems.  You can download it or stream it three times.  Three times and then that's it.  You got to pay another five bucks.  Yeah, but when you download it, that file's yours.  Right.  The reason for having it that you can download it three times is you can do it on three  different computers.  I downloaded it and then I had it on my Mac and then I just popped it on through Apple 
[02:39:00]  TV and there it is on my TV in my fuckin' living room.  Just like I was watching anything else that would have been on TV.  We're burning it.  You can burn a DVD and we're making, it's going to be up tomorrow, a DVD cover and label  kit that you can print out.  Oh, nice.  Because I think some people might want to give it physically to somebody.  Louie's like, look, I got the material.  Make the fuckin' shit yourself.  I did enough here.  Put it together, the box.  Take a box with the fuckin' whatever.  Get some glue and some scissors. 
[02:39:30]  Get it closer and see a DVD.  Pull the paper out of it.  Put my thing in it.  Put a CD in it.  I want to bring up something you said earlier about the ease of ordering and stuff like that  and a website that wants to just pound you and stuff like that.  I had an experience on the fuckin' phone the other day with the American Express.  I had gotten a new card and it gives you, you know, call this number so you could activate  your card.  And I love the shenanigans they pull with this fuckin' thing.  Call the number. 
[02:40:00]  Alright, put in your number.  I did it.  I jumped through the little hoops.  And then, at the end, they go, while we're processing your card, we'd like you to listen  to these new features that are available through American Express.  Like, no.  It's already processed.  Don't tell me there's some guy with a card catalog and little bifocals looking up my name.  Anthony Cunha.  Anthony Cunha.  Put on something else.  Tell him to keep listening.  I'm not through.  It's done.  And magically enough, the second their little presentation's over, your card has been verified. 
[02:40:30]  Perfect time.  Wow.  Every fuckin' time.  I don't want to sit through a commercial.  Yeah, weirdly, hold music stops in the middle of the song.  Right.  But somehow they got to thank you for listening.  It's the same as when you call somebody and say to go and leave a message, it takes a minute  to leave that message.  Dial five, do this.  So they keep you on for 40 seconds because they're getting all that fuckin' free air time.  Well, they're selling to you.  Well, they're not.  That doesn't make sense.  You want to sell on to you?  That makes no sense. 
[02:41:00]  What are you talking about?  Because you think they just like you listening to them?  No, no, no, nothing.  What I'm saying is when you call...  What?  No, they're keeping you on the air so they can charge you for...  Nobody pays for minutes.  Okay, he thinks he's getting charged while he's listening to an outgoing message.  Oh, per minute?  Nobody pays for minutes anymore.  Some people do.  Not many.  They're called black.  But who are you calling that cares that you're spending money?  No, stupid listening.  No, he means the length of the boilerplate. 
[02:41:30]  It's stupid.  It's you that's stupid, Ed.  I know.  He's talking about the boilerplate for, like, Verizon outgoing.  If you'd like to leave a message, you know...  Well, press this, press that.  So they're adding up their time.  We just got a tenth of a thousandth of a cent from you, sucker.  It's like when you go to pump gas.  No, you guys don't get it.  Oh, what's that?  When you go to pump gas, the last eight, eight cents is real, real slow.  And people go, oh, fuck it.  And you're getting charged air time for that eight cents.  No, no, listen.  If enough people go, fuck it at two cents, they're not sitting there.  Is that why they do that? 
[02:42:00]  No, that's why they do that.  That's why they do that.  Sorry, maybe.  Because it's slowing down.  Because it can't just go...  It can't just go...  25, done!  You can't do that.  Okay, well, you worked at a gas station.  I don't know that.  But you know what?  It works out in their favor, though.  It works out in their favor, though.  God damn it.  You might be honest.  I love that somebody would...  Like, there's an engineer.  Like, if we just...  It's a psychological edge we have.  If we slow it down, they're going to bolt.  Yeah.  And we're going to get... 
[02:42:30]  And this is drops of gas.  Why wouldn't that happen?  Yes.  And the cents are going to...  Why is it slow down at three cents instead of twelve?  Because someone's going to eventually go, fuck it, the last four cents.  And those cents will add up.  Those cents will add up.  Here's a better...  Here's a better...  Smarter example of what you're trying to say right now.  Okay, let's see.  I was going to guess Jimmy Johnson.  He needs to race out of the...  That should be your...  On the road, you should go to his markets and say, a better, smarter version of Rich  Boggs.  Just do all the same material, but just make it really concise. 
[02:43:00]  I don't have any markets.  I don't have any multiple shit.  It wouldn't work.  All right, go ahead.  Let me hear it.  No, it's...  Listen, it's like when you buy a Subway card and they go, hey, for ten...  If you buy the $10 card, well, it's not the exact amount for this many rides.  Yeah, of course.  And there's like a dollar left over.  And they know nobody's going to take that dollar and put it towards a ride and put more  money on.  You just throw the card with the dollar away.  And that's a buck they got out of you.  I think that's what you're trying to say. 
[02:43:30]  That happens?  I didn't realize.  That's a crime.  Well, okay, you know what?  See, that's a real thing that's happened.  I bet you some oil executive is going, he's on to us.  Oh, boy.  I'm sure it works out in their favor, but I don't think that's the reason they did it  in the first place.  I like how you think oil executives are listening to the show right now.  And it's the executive that goes out with his tie and goes, well, Rich Voss, we want  to talk to you.  I'll say, I'll say, it's time we listen to Opie and Anthony.  He pulls up in a Cadillac with horns on the front, in front of Rich's house. 
[02:44:00]  Wow, this must be the Rich Voss house, I'll say.  Well, we're on to you, boy.  How much you want?  How much you want to keep your mouth shut, boy?  God damn it.  That was fucking great.  I still don't know who's charging for that phone call.  That boggled me.  Why don't they just bring you right to, all I know is they're reframing my house now and  it's starting to get old.  It's still going.  Yeah, you just will not give it up. 
[02:44:30]  It's amazing.  Could be talking to you, CK, but we have conspiracy theories to get to with Rich Voss.  He doesn't even hear us right now because he doesn't have his head speakers on.  Head speakers.  He called them head speakers.  Yeah, put on your head speakers.  Could you put on your head speakers or your ear speaker?  You know, I'm outgrowing you guys.  What?  I'm done.  Oh, look at those hands.  It's still tiny.  You're not outgrowing anybody.  Nothing's growing on you.  Rich.  Oh, you fuck.  What's the matter, Rich? 
[02:45:00]  What's wrong, Rich?  It's always a catastrophe.  I've been thinking about that for years and I thought I was right about it.  Do you ever notice how much longer it takes to slide that thing across?  That's a scam.  That's where they get you.  That's where they get you.  That's how they get you.  That's how they get you.  They make you look at the screen for 10 seconds longer than you need to.  No, but it's true that they don't, like they sell you while you're buying it already.  Yeah.  Like you're, I'm fucking, I got the card.  You got me already.  I'm done.  I'm here.  Jesus.  Leave me alone.  I'm watching Channel 2. 
[02:45:30]  Leave me the fuck alone.  Let me actually enjoy the product now.  Don't sell to me while I'm fucking trying to take it in.  The worst one of those I ever saw was whatever, whatever weird network that Dr. Drew talk show  was on.  It's something like all help, self-help networks.  At the end of his show, literally for the last like four minutes, the fuck, his show goes  like this up into the corner.  Oh, they squeeze it.  And then the other 75% of the screen is the, is a countdown clock and the ad for the next 
[02:46:00]  show.  It's like, are you fucking kidding me?  I've seen that.  I've seen him squeeze the-  It's like when you have an agent or a manager, like if you, if you ever interview with agents,  like when you're looking for a new agent and they'll, I've had this conversation every  single time.  They say, hey, here's the advantage of signing with me.  My other clients are this director, this director, you know, Quentin Tarantino.  I represent, you know, fucking whoever.  I can't think of any, you know, Peter Bogdanovich.  And if you sign with me, I will horn you into his, I'll get you onto his movies. 
[02:46:30]  And then I go, well, if I make a movie, do I have to fucking hire your clients?  No, I would never do that.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  So you just, I'm your favorite person in the world and you don't even have me yet?  Fucking assholes.  You're a liar.  You're just a liar, right?  It's amazing.  Well, aren't they all?  When a show, when a show ends now and they squeeze the credits and they roll them at  fucking thousand miles an hour, you can't even see them.  And the others, the next show is starting above the credits already. 
[02:47:00]  Yes.  It's like, because they can't put a commercial in there anymore.  And if you remember when I was growing up, you know, with the fucking three channels,  it was like a fuckload of commercials at the top of the hour before a show.  That's right.  And that was it.  Well, that's what, like, we were talking about, I came in under budget with the special.  I've got a bunch of money that I expected to spend.  Louis C.K. for president, I say.  Fix this fucking economy.  He's changing the world.  We came in way under and we have extra money, which I could keep.  But then I thought if we, it's worth, if there's a way to invest it and increase the 
[02:47:30]  sales, it's worth it.  Yeah.  And I thought maybe buy advertising.  That's one thing I thought.  I could afford to do it.  And so I was talking to a guy about it and he said, well, I was asking him about TV ads,  like getting, you know, little clusters of cable ads and stuff.  And he said, the web advertising is so great, but I'm not going to do it because a TV ad  comes on between the shows.  You're done watching and it comes on.  And TV ads have been there forever and ever.  But a web ad comes on on top of a thing you're trying to use. 
[02:48:00]  You're trying to use something and it comes on.  And I just know if I make a web ad, I've never clicked on a banner in my life.  No.  I could have a banner that has you, Anthony, on it saying, hey, Louis.  Louis, please click this.  Please, it'll save my family's lives.  Yeah.  Now I see your face in front of something I'm trying to jack off.  Fucking Anthony.  Come on, man.  It instantly makes you pissed off.  It's just an intrusive.  And they're always, even if it's like people are like Will Ferrell, like knocking on the  glass of my computer. 
[02:48:30]  Hey, click on this.  Fuck you, Will.  You make me laugh, but right now you're just making me angry.  Yeah.  And they made the ads way, way, way more intrusive because there was a good couple of years  where they'd go, you can get the free version of this site, but to get rid of the ads.  And I was like, I don't give a fuck.  Put the ads up.  I'm not paying for this shit.  And then they made the ads like, eh.  They're insane.  So you have to go, fuck it.  I'll pay for it.  This is driving me crazy.  And now they're using ads as leverage to get you to pay to clean the site.  So you're actually so complete insane.  You want to watch these fucking ads?  Yeah, look how bad they are.  That's your problem at all. 
[02:49:00]  They're telling the advertiser, look how much room we're giving you.  They don't know they're actually doing that to drive this other price up.  Get money to stop the ads.  Yeah, you can't see any.  We'll let you use the site for free.  This guy's going to jerk off in your eyes, though.  What site is that?  If you make a thing pleasant to go to, like the other thing I did was you don't have to  go away and then get an email, that sort of confirmation email thing, which is just another 
[02:49:30]  security step.  Yeah.  But how many fucking people, like when I first sold a CD and DVD on my website years ago,  somebody would email me the money through PayPal.  And once in a while, somebody would write and go, hey, I wrote, I put the money.  But I didn't get the thing.  I didn't get a confirmation.  And I'd be like, how do I figure this out?  I call PayPal and I was on phone with PayPal for like 10 minutes.  And I was like, why am I doing this?  Just send it.  Send it.  Just fucking send it.  It cost me 50 cents.  I've been selling some Live from the Compound t-shirts. 
[02:50:00]  I'm in the t-shirt business.  Nice.  And I hate the fact because I wound up, I got a lot of orders for fucking t-shirts.  And I'm, I'm kneeling on my living room floor, printing labels out and shoving shirts in  a plastic envelope.  I used to do that for the fucking millionaires.  It's like, yeah, yeah.  And I'm sitting there like, why am I doing this?  But yeah, I figured out like a faster system after a while.  Right.  Fuck it.  Whatever.  But I've gotten a couple of people that have been like, uh, I get an email and they're  instantly nasty. 
[02:50:30]  Dude.  It starts like, dude, I fucking sent the money and I've been waiting.  I didn't get the fucking shirt.  You know, I'm going to call my credit card company and dispute this shit.  And then I wrote him back.  I go, hey fella.  I go, your shirt's on the way.  Oh, well, I'm not sending any more money for shipping.  It's like, no, I'm sending it.  Oh, thanks.  Like they get so fucking, they get so pissed.  So when I used to sell CDs on my, on my website.  I said they want their merchandise. 
[02:51:00]  When I used to sell stuff on my website, I used to do that too.  And I was always in trouble.  I was constantly in trouble with somebody, you know, people.  You know, I, it was a trust issue that I sent you.  A trust issue.  Come on.  I saw, I logged on and I saw a dispute.  I like fucking customers dispute.  I was like, oh, so what happened?  No, when this thing went live, like we, we put it up on noon on Saturday.  This is one of the funnest things I ever did because it's not, I have no experience in  this kind of thing.  Brand new.  Yeah.  And all the stuff, like I made the website very big. 
[02:51:30]  We, I paid a shitload of money.  Like I doubled what I thought I'd probably have to pay.  Okay.  Just there'd be no question.  So it's super fast and it's super, there's two British guys running it.  So if you ever have to talk to somebody, it's a British, you know, nice man.  That sounds good.  Yeah, exactly.  But when it first went live and it started watching the sales number come up and then  the, and the dispute number was the other one and it would be like one for every few  thousand.  Like it was really, it was really, I think we've had like 10 people. 
[02:52:00]  What do you mean?  Their money back, I think five of them were because they thought they were buying tickets  to a show.  For $5?  For $5.  Yes, you virtually are buying tickets to a show.  Yeah, exactly.  Unbelievable.  The worst is when you send somebody something like they go, hey, can I get your CD?  And you go, just what's your address?  I'll mail you one.  And they don't fucking thank you.  It drives me fucking.  That's what bothers Rich.  It does because she says somebody wrote, a woman wrote me on my email about a month  before the Beacon show.  And she said, my husband is a huge fan and I wanted to get him this for his birthday. 
[02:52:30]  And she gave me a list of problems they've been having, economic problems.  And I never, I never answer that kind of stuff because it's like, come fucking pay the  money and see my show.  But I don't know, something about this email is like, I'm sitting here, I'm taking a shit.  She wants two tickets.  It's not that hard.  And I just forwarded it to my agent and said, give her two, she, I said, give her two comps  just for whatever she wants, whatever show she wants to go to.  Never heard, never heard nothing. 
[02:53:00]  No thank you.  Nothing.  Nothing.  She got the tickets and was like, yeah, those are my, yeah, that's right.  Ugh.  That's how you get your tickets.  No fucking thing.  Fucking asshole.  They asked us, and we talked about this on the podcast, they asked us to do benefits.  Okay, you'll do a benefit, you do your time.  But then I'll call you and go, can you put it on Twitter?  Can you put it on Facebook?  Can you do it?  Now I'm not only doing a benefit, I'm your fucking promoter.  Okay?  And then you do the fucking benefit and you don't get a thank you.  Finally, we got one six weeks later or four weeks later.  I was out of my fucking mind.  Well, they're a little busy trying to help the fucking African people. 
[02:53:30]  Sick people.  Dying people.  Sorry, Rich.  I'm trying to feed this kid with no mouth.  We're trying to find lips for this kid.  And you want your thank you.  We haven't thanked Rich for his 15 minutes between Robert Wall and fucking Caroline Ray.  We still have to thank him.  The audience would be thanking me for that.  Yes, I would think so.  Their kid is not going to see the age five, but you need your thank you.  No, I don't like yourself. 
[02:54:00]  It's a benefit.  It's a benefit.  But a benefit, when I do a benefit, it costs us at least two others.  Of course.  To put a babysitter.  Listen.  I know it does, but you're doing it for a thank you.  Oh my God, he's got no.  You're doing it for the thing, for the people.  You don't like a thank you?  Rich, a thank you would be nice, but most people understand that there's other things going on.  You don't get mad when people don't thank you.  Rich, Rich, hey?  If I tell you the person was, you would.  No.  Rich, I have never said this in my life, and I don't ever think this, except for you. 
[02:54:30]  Well, I'm going on a diet?  No, you are such...  You are such...  Joe's not a heavy guy.  He needs a trainer, not a diet.  No, he needs to get healthy.  He's not healthy.  He's pale, and he's fucking...  Not a hint of muscle, but besides that.  But he's not heavy.  The first time...  I mean, shit on him for the proper reason.  He's a fucking flabby Jew.  It's the other end of the spectrum.  You actually got fucking pasty and asexual enough for God, the Jewish God, to love you. 
[02:55:00]  He took you in.  You're like a sort of physical inspiration for me.  I know.  Because the first time I worked with you, years and years ago, you were telling me...  Was that Raleigh or somewhere?  Yeah, we were in North Carolina for New Year's.  And you were telling me about going around that jogging track.  Yeah.  You were, I think, 40 at the time.  I was running, yeah.  I thought at 40, if I could get around this...  And I was like, I got till 40. 
[02:55:30]  I can fuck off till 40.  Okay.  So, that made me feel like...  How old are you now?  34.  Oh, shit.  I thought you were 38.  Six years.  39.  Six years is a lot of money.  And he's like fucking 59.  I know.  I know.  I got to...  We care about you.  Jesus.  How old are you, Anthony?  Oh, I've just cracked the half a century mark.  That's it?  Really?  Yeah.  How old are you?  48.  That's crazy.  You're 49, aren't you?  No.  Fuck.  How'd that happen? 
[02:56:00]  I don't know.  That's my age.  That's my age.  Jesus.  How old are you, Voss?  54.  Are you really?  I'll be 55 in tune.  He looks good.  Voss looks good.  How are the abs today?  He's in the pocket.  You get to see the abs when he comes in.  Oh, God.  They're all hairy.  I know.  It holds the jizz.  You can't like...  Oh, no.  It gets all haunted.  It's like Raquel Welch's tits now.  Those used to be awesome.  Those were important ones. 
[02:56:30]  When I lose 10 pounds, I'm going to shave again.  What?  My chest.  Who cares?  These are your goals.  Why are you telling us that?  These are your goals.  Some people are like, I'm going to have my own show.  Right.  When I lose 10 pounds, I'm going to shave my abs again.  He's a great person.  Why do you need to lose 10 pounds?  Why do you have to lose 10 pounds?  Huh?  Why do you have to lose 10 pounds?  It's like it'd be fucking ripped, man, because I know we're going to get into a festival, and  I want to go there looking good, baby.  He's going to go to the beach with those blonde hair dunes. 
[02:57:00]  Listen, it was so nice when you came in.  We were talking.  I know.  You fall into their category.  What are you talking about?  Category?  You have your easy to set category.  Funny?  Rich, he's always been that guy.  What are you talking about?  No, he's not a double agent.  Oh, you thought he was being a double agent?  I have a big affinity for Rich Voss.  Who doesn't?  He's an important person.  Why?  You know what?  When I was getting divorced, he was really nice to me. 
[02:57:30]  That's all it takes.  Nice.  Yeah, I came to this show back when it was in another building.  We were nice to you.  No, you guys were nice to me.  No, you're not.  You know what I'm saying?  Of course you were.  I came into this show in like a stunned state of just, I was just fucking depressed.  Yeah.  And there's fucking dumb Rich Voss, and he says something to me like, if you ever want  to talk about what's going on with you, you know, I'll talk to you about it.  And I was like, why would I want to talk to you?  And, you know, you wear a gold Rolex, and you don't have any money.  I get a silver one, too.  And so, he sits next to me on the couch, and he goes, hey, you know, when I got divorced, 
[02:58:00]  I had two kids, two little girls, and he described my life exactly, exactly.  And he gave me, like, fucking said three or four things that meant, that were so important,  and just practical, when you're in a fucked up place like that, all the nice things people  say are just insulting.  Like, hey, man, you'll be okay.  Fuck you, no, I get through it.  The point is, no, I won't, you asshole.  The only thing that means anything is practical advice. 
[02:58:30]  It's like, hey, here's something that, I've been there, and here's something that makes  it easier.  What did he say?  Can he say?  It doesn't matter.  Well, he said, I'll tell you what he said.  It doesn't matter.  I'll tell you what he said.  Someone else out there.  He said, I'm going to cheat on Bonnie all the time.  He said to me that he is big, two things that were important to me.  First, he said that his biggest goal was to maintain a good relationship with his ex. 
[02:59:00]  Like, it was really important to him to do whatever it took to stay amicable with her.  And he said, now, Bonnie and I have a baby, and she babysits tonight so I can have a date  night.  That's how that paid off.  And that his two girls are now grown, and that they share them, and that they feel good  between their two parents.  So that's what that, he said, this is like, it's hard, but if you do it, here's what can  happen.  Like, there's a fucking future.  Rich, who told you this?  Yeah, this was amazing.  This is like...  And then I said, and then I'm asking questions. 
[02:59:30]  I'm like, you know, I've been, I had been divorced for a while, and I said, I dated for a bit,  and I didn't want to anymore.  Like, I didn't want to keep going out and trying to get laid.  I didn't like that part of it.  Like, I just didn't, I was like, a lot going on.  And I said, but that feels like I'm worried that I'm like reclusing myself by, and he said,  fuck getting laid.  You got a career, and you got two kids.  For right now, that can be enough.  Like, he gave me, it said, it's okay not to get laid sometimes.  As a man, you feel like you got to get pussy wherever it's available. 
[03:00:00]  But sometimes it's okay to take a breath, and actually just be a father, and a professional  whatever you are.  And it left me off the hook.  This shit meant a lot to me.  Wow.  Wow, look at that.  And I sit here, and I will insult him.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter what comics were supposed to.  But no, I'm grateful to Rich Voss.  I got a lot of support from unusual places during that.  That's odd.  When you get divorced, and you know this.  Well, yeah.  I had no kids, though.  Huh?  I had no kids, though.  Yeah, that's just a financial fleecing. 
[03:00:30]  That's just fucking extortion.  It's the same as in recovery.  If you quit drinking and doing drugs, and you start gambling, you're only transferring  addictions, and you're not dealing with quitting drinking and drugs.  Right.  If you're going through a divorce, and you just start fucking whatever you can, it's just  burying the pain in here, and you're jerking off in some girl.  Yeah, you're not actually...  That's all you're doing is...  That's why I think the problem with a lot of people now is that they're just consumers.  They just want to consume and shit, and they don't think about, like, well, I actually  need to do something to make myself feel better. 
[03:01:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I think I actually have to take a breath.  Like a locust in a pussy field.  You just got to kind of run your way through it, and eat it, and consume it, and then...  That's what we're saying.  I think that's the opposite of what he's trying to say.  I do what you do.  I just shove it all down.  Oh, just tamp it.  Tamp it down.  It's terrible, man.  You're making yourself ready for your first marriage.  It's all going to fucking unspool like a Chinese food container full of maggots in the middle 
[03:01:30]  of your marriage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My parents...  We talked about all this shit.  When my parents were fucking divorced, and they didn't have any knowledge back then.  This is fucking 40, 49 years old.  The bosses of now.  The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  Here's the thing.  You know, and we used to...  Your parents were shitty toward each other.  And they would set the kids up to go at each other.  A lot of people do that. 
[03:02:00]  And it's ridiculous.  It's fucking ridiculous because in the end, you end up doing crack and bad radio shows.  It's not fucking worth it.  And also, I think the basic thing is, it's like people just are narcissists.  Because the thing that's supposed to happen when you have kids is that they just become  more important than you.  And it's not like you do it painfully.  You just feel it.  You just go, the kid matters more.  So you would never do...  If you're that kind of person, then when you get in an altercation with another person,  you don't put your fucking kid in the middle of it to preserve yourself or to hurt someone 
[03:02:30]  else.  That's insane.  Pretty fucked up.  But a lot of people do it.  Like you said.  So fucked up.  Anybody, any parent that keeps their fucking kids from the other parent, those are the  ones that should lose their kids.  Okay?  Well, here's what some people say, and it's true.  If you have a kid and you're divorced and you say bad shit about the other kids, the  kid's other parent, you are criticizing 50% of the kid. 
[03:03:00]  Yes.  The kid, a kid, especially a kid who's a child, they are made up of two people and they identify  with a man and a woman, their mother and father.  So if you say your father's a piece of shit or your mother's a whore, the person's going  to feel that in themselves, they're going to take that in.  So it's not a stranger.  It's their fucking mom, you idiot.  I was 100% a piece of shit then.  Because my parents just would call each other horrid things.  Oh, right in front of the kids, too. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, listen.  Hey, when you're in the marriage, everybody's in the same house.  This shit goes on.  But look what they gave birth to.  There should be fights.  I know.  They made you shower together.  It was never my fault.  They told me, now we're getting divorced.  It's not your fault?  Or they didn't even use that word.  They were like, daddy's living somewhere else.  It's not your fault.  And I was like, I didn't think it was.  Now I'm starting to, though, because you're trying to tell me it's not.  Yeah, you just put that thought in my head.  What the fuck?  Is it my fault? 
[03:04:00]  I see you two yelling all the time about shit that doesn't even concern me.  Dad's drunk.  Fucking, he's not working.  It's suspicious.  Come to my house.  I promise I'm not going to rape you.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Why are you saying that?  Why are you saying that?  I would never rape you.  I would never.  That's why I love comedy.  Like, my parents, when I was in second grade, it was nothing but fighting, where's dad, this  and that.  So I'd come home from school.  Your last year of school.  And I would put fucking Von Meter album on and just listen to it every day and sit and  laugh and forget, you know. 
[03:04:30]  Whatever.  And just watch comics.  Von Meter.  Who's Von Meter?  He did the Kennedy impressions.  He was great.  He had the biggest fucking career.  That's what savved you and your sad family was Kennedy and Bro's Von Meter?  I was in second grade, man.  Oh my God.  Him and Alan King.  I'm sorry.  Hey, we got to go to the Lincoln bathroom and have a Lincoln log.  Go ahead and fuck me now, Dad.  It's fine.  And I heard Ken and I heard a lampooning of two presidents ago. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  When my parents died in that plane crash, I'll tell you, Rich Little.  Rich Little's Nixon.  He took me out of it.  He just raised me like the phoenix from the flames.  Who wouldn't laugh at that?  Yeah.  I thought they died.  I don't know.  No, my parents.  I'm adopted.  That's why I thought they died in a plane crash.  I don't know.  My real parents might be dead.  I have no fucking idea.  I never remember.  Yeah, on 9-11.  Oh, jeez.  Jesus.  Jesus.  That's a little racist. 
[03:05:30]  You're Arab and your parents now are white.  They've adopted you?  By blood, I'm half Arab and half Egyptian.  And my adoptive parents are 100% Italian.  Jesus Christ.  How far around the list do they have to go to get an Arab?  I mean, how many?  Not that far.  Even black kids first.  Oh, shit.  You can get two black kids.  I'm trying to get, yeah, like, if you want to adopt a white kid, you've got to wait 
[03:06:00]  on a line.  However, if you want to adopt an Asian or an Arab, that is like the fucking bargain  bit.  Right to the front of the line.  Oh, it's a bit.  Yeah, trying to get a white kid is like trying to get a Harley.  You guys come with a TV.  Lou, you're on reddit.com right now, the front page.  That's huge.  Oh, nice.  Well, I went on yesterday and I did a whole thing where you ask the answer questions. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, that's fucking huge.  Reddit.  I didn't know that that shit got reprinted because I was being really dirty, too.  Really?  That's all right.  The new special is called Live at the Beacon.  Louie C.K.  Available to stream or download for just five bucks.  Five bucks.  Louieck.com or .net.  I'm going to make it a giftable tomorrow, too.  We're going to make it that you can give it away, you know, like buy it and then send  it to somebody and you get a little envelope and...  Damn, you're thinking of everything.  Yeah, because it's just busy work.  It's just somebody doing it.  I want to know how many downloads so bad. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, I ain't telling you.  I mean, I might tell you off the air, but I'm not telling you.  I can't let it out.  It's like corporate secret information.  You seem very happy.  It's good.  It's good.  I'll say that so far, I mean, it's an ongoing experiment.  Are you surprised by the number?  Is it within range what you were hoping for?  I don't know because I had so many levels.  Like I had, there's like a bunch of tears of what could happen.  And the other thing is that, I mean, to me right now, it's been like a pre-sale.  Like I haven't promoted it.  This is like the first thing I've done to promote it.  I just tweeted it and read it and that's really it. 
[03:07:30]  Rich is crying.  There he goes.  I don't know if this is your first promotion and it's not really, this is a practice promotion.  Yeah, this is a practice.  And then I'm doing, you know, the Tonight Show and all that stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  And now it's like the thing that's interesting about it to me because everything that's on iTunes and Netflix and stuff, it starts out as a TV event.  Like it's been, it's going to be on at this time and then it gets a ratings number and then it moves on from there and then eventually it gets liquidated.  But the fact that this is starting as something that you go to as a destination and buy it, it's going to be interesting to see like how to, I'm sitting here watching sales while I'm sitting here. 
[03:08:00]  So when I do the Tonight Show, we'll see if it actually feeds it.  It's good, it's going up.  I mean, I don't know if it's the hour or the show, but it's, it's really interesting to watch how it goes, the stream goes up and down.  It gets slow at night and then towards like at 9.15 in the morning, all the, every day, there's a spike.  By the way, Louis is obsessed now with these numbers. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, no, it's so interesting.  But it's fun to watch numbers.  I love watching that shit.  The little graph and everything.  Yeah, exactly.  I study graphics and I like crap.  I'd say I'll be able to really know how it worked after it's been up for like a month or two.  Because you're supposed to be able to just keep making money with something and this won't maybe do that.  And you're hoping.  This will have a stopping point.  Right, right.  And you're hoping to do one of these a year, I would assume.  Yeah.  Because you do about an hour a year.  Well, I have also, I have a CD of, last year I did a tour that I called Word and it went, that material went into the series. 
[03:09:00]  And I never released it as its own thing.  But I shot it, I did a CD of it at Carnegie Hall.  So I have a live Carnegie Hall CD of that material.  Wow.  And a lot of it wasn't in the show.  So it's, and it's the only complete show of it.  So that's coming next and I'll sell that on the website.  That was a great show too.  I was at the Carnegie Hall.  That was a really fun show.  And it's been sitting in my desk in the drawer.  So I'm going to put it, I'm going to put it on the, and same thing with the labels and all that stuff.  And you've got to deal with the venues.  On the website, five bucks.  It'll always be five bucks.  The venues take their fucking piece.  And it's a big one, right? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Carnegie Hall was, I mean, there's, you know, it's funny.  You actually pay not to mention the place.  Like, it's called live at the Beacon Theater.  Because if I didn't call it that, it would cost me like 20,000 bucks to not use the name.  So it's called an origin fee.  That's so fucked up.  Yeah, it's weird.  Boy, they can't even fucking, no matter what you're trying to do in this world.  I don't mind calling it live at the Beacon because Carlin did a special there.  And I love that theater, you know.  But, you know, I would like to not have had to. 
[03:10:00]  But the Carnegie Hall CD, I'll put that out next.  And then, yeah, next year I'll probably do another special.  I hear it's almost impossible to shoot video at Carnegie Hall.  That number is ridiculous.  No, well, we did a CD there.  Yeah.  It would have been a lot.  Because, well, their union is.  They want some bucks for that.  They do.  I've heard that over the years.  The CD is good, though.  The guy who does like the orchestras did.  Not that, you know, he had one fucking mic to just.  Yeah.  He's used to mic in orchestras.  That mic right there.  That one. 
[03:10:30]  But it was this Russian guy or German or something.  He was like, this sounds is very good.  I'd want you to speak for a while at your regular tone.  And I spoke.  And he kept coming to this little man.  It was kind of cool.  One other thing I want to mention.  I just remember when I was at the Beacon show, you fucking lost it because the guy with the spotlight fell asleep.  Yeah, he lost me.  He lost me.  That's not in this special, right?  No, it's not.  Oh, that's too bad.  Because we weren't taping that show.  Because how you handled that was hilarious.  Yeah.  You're basically telling the guy, look, your only job is to follow me.  Yeah.  Every time I stood still for a while, if I walked to my right or left, I'd walk in a darkness. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, shit.  He finally had to dress it.  It was hilarious.  Yeah, I had to say, fucking stay with me.  It's called a follow spot.  And then he realized he might have hit him a little too hard because then Louie's like,  I love everyone here at the Beacon.  I love the unions and blah, blah, blah.  These massive stagehands.  Yeah.  These guys are enormous.  And I live down the street.  I walk by there with my kids all the time.  They could easily just...  There's a fucking Louie.  Right, right.  Oh, did I not follow you enough?  How about if I follow you now? 
[03:11:30]  Right.  With a bat.  The whole...  How it went down was...  The whole thing was hilarious.  Because then you realize, all right, I better apologize a little bit, too.  Well, that was a fun, man.  They might pull the power in the middle of this fucking thing.  That was a fun show.  And the show I did was...  I did an hour and 45 minutes, but I cut it down to an hour because it just made it better.  And the other shit I've been putting out on YouTube.  Right.  Just throwing it out there.  Good for you, man.  So what weeknights are you at college?  Oh, boy.  Well, it's funny listening to, like, Louie talking about watching the spikes and the numbers.  I'm like, oh, this is what it's like when your stuff really sells. 
[03:12:00]  Like, I get a check for my record label, and I'm just like, I believe you.  I never saw any money.  I always had back-end deals for DVDs and stuff.  Never saw a penny of it.  And I'm not...  The money I'm making is not life-changing.  But the thing that's good about it is that it's in my bank account.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, that never happens.  You don't actually get the money.  We got to go back to 1998, I guess.  We put a CD out, and the experience was so horrible, we never tried again. 
[03:12:30]  And the CD sold really well.  The shyster was in charge of all the fucking things.  And at the time, it got really good reviews.  I don't know if the material holds up anymore, but for the time, it did very well.  And it was charting locally and here and there, whatever.  But this shyster, what were we getting?  Like, 25 cents that we had to split between each other?  The deal was so bad.  It was 25 cents.  No, 75 cents.  75 cents a disc that we had to split, but there was no accounting of officially what we sold.  And then one day, he kind of gave us a check, and then he stopped paying us because he was mad at us. 
[03:13:00]  Right.  And he was making money off posters and T-shirts that he printed.  We also saw him in a corner, counting money, when we were doing signings, he was in a corner, and you just hear,  Like, all right, I think something's going on.  Did he pay you guys like this?  One for you?  Two for me?  Nothing.  No, I wish there was a one for me.  Just to show you, it was the Springfield Mall in Massachusetts.  We did an eight-hour signing.  This line was fucking for days, basically. 
[03:13:30]  And he's selling posters and T-shirts without giving us a piece of the action.  And like Dan said, he had a stack of fucking money.  Somebody's selling on iTunes, some of your, like, you know, people in studio for, like, $2.99 a thing.  That's not you guys doing that?  No.  No, I don't sell any.  I thought that that was SiriusXM doing that.  Every fucking day the episode goes up.  Bootleggers.  iTunes are able to do that?  Yeah, they, what?  Oh, Audible we got.  Well, Audible does, but there are people bootlegging our shit. 
[03:14:00]  Torrance and stuff.  Oh, yeah, man.  You know, iTunes offered right before I put this up to take it, and they gave us a really  good offer.  But the weird thing to me about iTunes is, like, my show is on iTunes, and no one, like,  I get emails from people all the time, I can't, where can I see the second season?  It's on iTunes.  It's a buck episode.  People write me from England and say, why won't they show your show over here?  You can get it worldwide on iTunes, and nobody goes there.  There's something about iTunes people don't love getting there.  I don't know what it is.  I mean, I know it's huge, but maybe not for comedy. 
[03:14:30]  It's like, oh.  Oh, my shit's on my CD.  It's also good for podcasts, I think it is good.  No, I mean my CD.  It's awesome.  Oh, well, no, you're not going to sell it.  Oh, you're done.  You're not selling any of those.  No, forget it.  It went down to $4.  Voss' CD is still empty inside.  It's out today.  But what about...  It'd be great if you get the CD and there's a lot of CD in it.  There's nothing in there.  I mean, someone wrote me, is that your apartment?  I mean, your house?  Oh.  Our house burned down.  Oh, it did?  Yeah, in August.  I'm sorry. 
[03:15:00]  You didn't do it.  Bonnie's wife did.  His wife did.  We're convinced of it.  Third season?  Yeah, June.  June?  Late June.  All right, we got a while.  Nice.  Fuck, I hate when you have to wait between seasons.  That's good.  That's why I love The Wire so much.  I haven't written anything.  I didn't watch The Wire when it first came out, so by the time I was into The Wire, I  had three seasons in front of me to catch up with.  I got to get...  Someone said, you got to get this Boardwalk Empire.  Is it great?  A lot of people are talking about it.  I still haven't seen it.  This Boardwalk Empire. 
[03:15:30]  They're all the kids that are talking about it.  You speak of.  Yeah.  I'm talking like we're in Braveheart.  I'm in the third season of Sons of Anarchy.  No way to get information.  Also, I dedicated the thing to Patrice.  I don't know if any of you noticed.  Yeah, I saw that at the end.  Yeah.  Really, really cool.  Fuck.  Big.  Yeah.  That still hurts a lot.  Yep.  I mean, we haven't talked about it as much, but it fucking still hurts a lot.  Yep.  It's fucking horrible.  There was a lot of ONA guys out in Minneapolis at the shows, and they were coming up, and our 
[03:16:00]  condolences, our condolences.  And a bunch of guys were like, dude, I cried when he died.  They were like, I never met the guy, but I cried.  Yeah, people that never met him.  That's so weird.  The fans have been fucking amazing about this whole thing.  Because there's always assholes, no matter what is happening around here.  Especially our fans.  But with this one, man, I just didn't see it.  Horrible shitheads.  They were just amazing.  A couple dickheads, but not worth really mentioning by name.  No, no.  But in general, holy fuck, the love for this guy. 
[03:16:30]  Jesus.  Yeah, it's un-fucking-believable, man.  Still.  Nice.  Now that we're depressed.  Yeah, sorry.  On a high note.  Everyone get their plugs out?  Uh, Caroline.  Oh, no, we got the promo code for you, Joe.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, Caroline's tomorrow, Thursday, and Sunday.  We're going to go to one of the shows.  It's promo code O-N-Day.  And you'll save a whole bunch of money on your ticket.  What?  Oh, all lowercase.  Why would that matter?  It does.  Why the fuck would they do that?  They should learn from Louie.  Make it easy. 
[03:17:00]  You know what?  Uppercase, lowercase, it shouldn't matter.  But it has to be lowercase.  Yeah, please come out to the shows.  All right.  Yes.  Go see Joe DeRosa.  He's really funny, man.  Fuck yeah, yeah.  Really good comic.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Thanks, Louie.  Thank you.  I ain't going.  And Rich, we already said you were funny.  The podcast went down to number nine since we've been on the radio.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm telling you what.  We used to have so much heat.  Huh?  We used to have so much heat.  It said number nine.  No, it went up to number nine.  Then it means it went up.  It went up to number nine.  No, it went from 25 down. 
[03:17:30]  It's not like, oh, it's number one.  Oh, my God.  No, it doesn't go down.  Oh, my God.  You should just fucking depress the shit out of me.  It went up.  Fucking dummy.  Rich.  You know what I was saying.  He goes, it went down to number nine.  That means we suck.  Everything I said, you fucking just discounted all that.  I hope you gave me what else I wanted.  And then he tries to explain how that's going down.  Fucking dummy.  How is it going down from 25 to 9?  We're number one.  When everyone looks at it as going up on the charts.  No, you're acting like climbing the charts has been the expression for the last 50 fucking years.  Keep the press the shit out of me. 
[03:18:00]  Nobody's ever seen it that way.  I was doing this without a promo code.  And then I'm like, fuck, we used to have heat.  It was like, no, we actually did good by you today.  Thank you, guys.  Roland, you good?  Thank you.  Why'd you come in?  I'll tell you why he came in.  He wants to know.  If there's a woman that's always cold around the house.
