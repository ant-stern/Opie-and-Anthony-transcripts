<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's broadcast, airing on the 8th anniversary of 9/11, opened with cynical commentary on the anniversary's commemoration.  Opie, increasingly irritated by the perceived insincerity of the media's presentation each year, criticized the shift from somber coverage to a more relaxed tone.  The hosts decried the slow rebuilding of Ground Zero compared to the rapid construction of sports stadiums, and expressed outrage at the perceived preferential treatment of Guantanamo Bay detainees and the potential legal repercussions for interrogators.  They discussed a minor league baseball game ejection incident involving individuals who didn't stand for "God Bless America," reflecting on shifting social attitudes.  The President's absence from the Ground Zero ceremony, contrasted with his presence at the Walter Cronkite memorial, was heavily criticized.  The discussion touched upon fading collective memory of 9/11 and the rise of conspiracy theories. A listener called in, highlighting the show's unique contribution in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 by providing unfiltered commentary.  Interwoven throughout this segment was a discussion about Caster Semenya's athletic eligibility, with several listener calls and Larry King on hold.

The show continued with further frustration over the slow Ground Zero rebuilding, satirizing ceremonial groundbreakings and photo opportunities.  This transitioned into a series of vulgar phone calls, featuring Larry King, Eddie Murphy (joking about the Eliot Spitzer scandal), and Andy Rooney, contributing to a chaotic and sexually charged atmosphere.  Extensive, crude speculation about Caster Semenya's sex life and anatomy followed. A caller, Josh, shared the challenges of teaching children about 9/11 in school.  Howard Stern made a brief call, making a joke about "tiny peeners."  A running gag about Bob Kelly's song, "Titty Mountain Highway" (which Kelly insisted was "Teddy Mountain Highway"), ensued, prompting much mockery.  Anthony Cumia then detailed an ongoing feud with an obsessed Twitter user ("Talesin") who spread false accusations about Cumia's involvement in a woman's death, including details of the user's harassment and threats.

Comedian Jim Jefferies and Otto (of Otto and George) joined the show.  The conversation started with Jefferies discussing his upcoming performances, then delved into a discussion about date formats, the 9/11 attacks (with varying degrees of seriousness and humor), Ground Zero rebuilding, and the metric system.  A caller shared a story about a metric-only speed limit.  Jeffries recounted packing for a trip to Britain when 9/11 occurred.  The hosts bantered with callers about driving on different sides of the road, referencing medieval jousting and button placement on shirts.  A call from Joe Cumia (Anthony's brother, in a U2 cover band "2U") led to discussion about the band and a traffic stop anecdote.  Further discussion on 9/11 included conspiracy theories and technological advancements in broadcasting.  A news clip of Rosanna Scotto calling 9/11 the "most spectacular day ever" (weather-wise) was played, prompting more humorous discussion.  Speculation about Osama Bin Laden's appearance followed, comparing him to Scottie Pippen.  Jeffries shared an anecdote about handling explosives in Afghanistan and subsequent airport interrogation.  The segment concluded with further 9/11 discussion and promotion for Otto and George's performances.

The segment with Jim Jefferies and Otto continued with more 9/11 discussion and critique of Rosanna Scotto.  They discussed Otto and George's often racist and offensive comedy act, including a story about a confrontation with a heavyweight boxer.  A caller discussed Osama bin Laden's alleged dialysis treatment, sparking absurd and offensive speculation about 9/11, Osama's health, and dialysis logistics.  The conversation then shifted to John Denver, including unsubstantiated rumors of domestic violence and his death. A caller mentioned his father being in a John Denver tribute band, leading to more discussion about tribute bands.  More off-color humor followed, touching upon the telephone's invention, Reagan's campaigns, and Jefferies' military experiences.  Extensive offensive back-and-forth occurred between the hosts, Jefferies, and callers, focusing on Pete Best (the rejected Beatles drummer).  The segment ended with promotion for Jefferies' and Otto and George's shows and a final offensive joke.

The broadcast concluded with a brief discussion of an earlier segment ("Don't Tread on Me"), referencing a listener's call from eight years prior.  A song played with lyrics repeatedly using phrases like "Don't try me," "So be it," and referencing fighting, war, and aggression.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, good morning.  A palaver.  Welcome to your live programming at Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  The workhorses are here today.  Hi.  On the 8th anniversary of 9-11.  Yeah, what are we playing this for?  We should have somber music.  Sombber music.  Although the news, you were noticing, kind of getting away from that.  Yeah, last year it was all about the somber music, the graphics.  That was the last real year for that, I think.  The black clothes, this year they're sort of starting the seg out of it. 
[00:00:30]  We got our black clothes on today.  Because you know what?  Just like everyone else is saying, we'll never forget.  Never forget.  One of the hackiest things I've ever heard in my life.  Never forget.  We'll never forget.  Really?  Other people will, but we'll never forget.  Because here at Dunkin' Donuts, we care.  Oh, I know.  It's all worked into advertising.  We love Dunkin' Donuts, by the way.  I'm just using them as an example.  I don't even know if they did that, because I don't want to get in trouble with the advertisers. 
[00:01:00]  It's just one of these things.  And I've been, I told Ovi before, I've just been cranky since I started driving in.  And I'm listening to the news.  And before that, I was looking at news sites and everything.  Wait, wait, wait.  You were cranky because you had to drive into work on a Friday.  This is true.  That'll make me cranky.  Oh, no.  We're not bitter that we have to work every Friday.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Oh, my God.  But I would be so snoozing right now. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, we kind of beat them up for taking Fridays off in 20 weeks a year.  But you know what?  Oh, God bless them.  You know what?  If they offered us that deal.  Taking a second.  We're taking it and running with it.  But what?  The 9-11 thing making you cranky?  Yeah, yeah.  The 9-11 thing makes me cranky.  Each year, I get a little crankier about it.  And part of it has to do with what we were just talking about.  The newscasters, they're kind of loosening up a little.  They used to wear very, like everyone was completely in black suits, almost tuxedos. 
[00:02:00]  And they're sitting there in the women, like funeral attire.  Yeah, when I look at the news people and they have that really black clothing on.  I mean, you can wear black.  It's stylish, you know, and you can get away with it.  But when you see the news people with the black clothing on, you're like, oh, my God.  That's what they wore when their grandmothers died.  Or their grandpas died.  Or, you know, some horrific tragedy in their lives.  They had to buy that suit.  They didn't buy it for 9-11. 
[00:02:30]  They're just bringing it out of the closet for the 9-11 stuff.  Oh, we're back with our continuing coverage of the 8th anniversary of the 9-11 tragedy.  We'll have team coverage from all around Manhattan, especially down at the World Trade Center site.  And correspondents at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania.  We're bringing this to you dressed completely in black. 
[00:03:00]  Our lighting guy and producer are very angry because this doesn't show up well on camera.  So black and so sad.  So poor, so black and so sad.  They did kind of get a little off of it, though.  They're not as somber.  They're not dressed as black as they have been.  But, Ann, people are scratching their heads.  The reason we're saying this is because tomorrow, well, it's falling on a Friday this year. 
[00:03:30]  But if it was yesterday, let's say, they would be back with their hula hooping.  And their, you know, dance contest on the news.  Hey, we have the Knicks cheerleaders are coming in today to show us some of their moves.  The squirrel, water skiing, all that crap comes back.  All the garbage.  I mean, it's all just bullshit.  Yeah.  They're just playing a role for a day.  They don't give a shit.  No one gives a shit anymore.  That is the headline.  No one gives a shit anymore unless, unfortunately, you were one who lost somebody. 
[00:04:00]  Here's who gives a shit.  People that lost people in the attacks and rescue workers that were there doing the rescuing.  They'll never forget.  And then a few, I think a few people.  But to have that actual feeling in the pit of your stomach when you think about it that you had on the day, eight years ago, that feeling you had.  And they go through the pomp and circumstance. 
[00:04:30]  They'll be ringing the bells, reading the names, moments of silence, all that stuff.  But, you know something?  The remembering of the victims is one thing.  The remembering of the perpetrators is what I really hate seeing being completely forgotten as the years go on.  But if you told me eight years ago, as I'm watching the nightmare that was going on in lower Manhattan and at the Pentagon and, of course, in Pennsylvania, 
[00:05:00]  if you told me that we would be arguing the point of hurting people's feelings in Guantanamo Bay, terrorists, hurting their feelings if they don't have a Koran, making sure they get the adequate sleep during questioning,  actually considering bringing charges against CIA agents that were interrogating these savage animals. 
[00:05:30]  And now, eight short years later, we're discussing bringing charges against these heroes that went in there and got information that, for the most part, I don't know, I'm not privy to it, neither are really any of us.  I was.  That perhaps, if you look at the eight years after, we haven't been attacked, knock fucking wood.  But do you think maybe the intelligence agencies joining together, the FBI, the CIA, before 9-11, of course, they were all willy-nilly. 
[00:06:00]  Then they finally decided under the Bush administration, look, we got to fucking get together, share information, get the intelligence, get more agents out in the field, do this work.  And now, we're right back to, hey, I think that guy kept this man awake with loud music and might have, you know, waterboarded him or done this or that. 
[00:06:30]  If you told me, if you told anyone in this country we'd be arguing that eight years later, you'd punch them in the face.  You'd go, shut the fuck up.  You'd beat them, you'd go to any car on the street, take the flag that was on any car you could find, the American flag, and beat them with that fucking thing.  Those, you know, long gone.  It astounds me that people have forgotten about the perpetrators, the terrorists.  Terrorists. 
[00:07:00]  And we sit here eight years later, yeah, commemorating the victims, remembering the victims, remembering the heroes, the firemen, who, by the way, you know, at this point, I think people look in their rearview mirror and go, ah, firetruck's coming.  Fuck, this might make me miss the next light.  I don't know, what do I do?  Meanwhile, they were, you know, the hero alley that they were driving through for a while.  Where everyone was applauding.  Right, applauding, holding up signs, but then these motherfuckers, they just forget, and the true feelings of these people come through. 
[00:07:30]  Where it was this temporary, rah, rah, let's go, let's unite as Americans and fight these terrorists and savages, to, hey, that CIA agent may have slapped that guy in the face.  We best bring him up on charges.  That's not the way we do things.  We had a great opportunity eight years ago.  Remember, like, the whole, well, I was going to say the whole world, the whole country. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I could just talk for Manhattan.  Everyone was one.  Everyone was in this thing together.  You were talking to strangers, which was kind of cool.  Yep.  And now we go back to being robots.  We don't acknowledge our neighbor.  We don't acknowledge nothing or anyone.  There were no qualms also about, this is shortly after 9-11, just a few days even, a few weeks, whatever.  Vendors on the sidewalks selling pictures. 
[00:08:30]  And for the most part, they were some type of immigrant.  Some type of immigrant.  Yeah.  And selling pictures of the burning towers, like 8x10s.  You frame them and bring them home.  What are you going to do with this fucking thing?  And it was not even a problem to walk up to that motherfucker and go, hey, dickhead, get that fucking shit off your table.  And everybody around was like, yeah.  And would gang up on the guy and go, get that shit off.  What the fuck are you capitalizing off of that for? 
[00:09:00]  For the most part, those pictures haven't.  No, they went away.  Yeah, they haven't made an appearance since.  They went away lickety-split.  Yeah, those vendors aren't brave enough to, not one vendor out there is brave enough to go, well, I'm going to test the waters and see.  I'm going to put my toe in the water here.  I'm going to see if I can get a few of these sold.  They've just been sitting in my basement for the last eight years.  It just upsets the shit out of me.  What drives me nuts is that there's absolutely nothing going on at Ground Zero eight years later.  I shouldn't say absolutely nothing, but I mean, this shit should have been rebuilt immediately. 
[00:09:30]  We couldn't even figure that out after 9-11.  It just drives me insane.  Another story I heard this morning, which just got me, that it's the eighth anniversary of the attacks, 9-11.  And I hear this story on the news that Newark Stadium, three gentlemen, apparently, one of which I don't remember all their names, but one of them had Mohammed as a middle name.  For real?  Yeah.  Okay.  And they wouldn't stand for God Bless America. 
[00:10:00]  Now, the owner, I believe, of Bears Stadium, or a very high official there, whatever, saw this, went over to him and goes, hey, everyone in my stadium, he goes, in my stadium stands for this.  And they refused to stand.  So he goes, you know what?  You don't want to stand?  Get the fuck out.  So he had them removed from the stadium.  Removed from a minor league baseball game?  From a minor league baseball game.  Exactly.  They weren't missing much.  Yeah.  Tell me about it.  Newark fucking Bears.  You're right.  They weren't missing much.  Right on.  But they are now suing for unspecified damages because they were removed from a ballpark for not standing during God Bless America, and they are obviously a Muslim. 
[00:10:30]  And if you think, again, eight years ago, if these motherfuckers would have done that, first of all, in the ballpark, they would have killed them right there in the ballpark.  Oh, my God.  Secondly, if you heard that they were now going to sue, who would entertain that? 
[00:11:00]  Now, eight years later, all right, sue.  Well, taxpayers will give you money.  And unfortunately, they got a good case.  Of course they do.  Because you can't force someone to stand for that.  I think the owner or whoever this person was, you know, God bless him.  Hopefully they reserve the right to remove anybody from the stadium for no reason whatsoever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, maybe there's some kind of little, I mean, who reads what's on the back of those tickets?  But I guess there's some important info there.  I don't know.  All Muslims, get up off your fucking ass for God bless America. 
[00:11:30]  That's what I say.  But, yeah, we should have rebuilt the shit immediately.  That would have made everyone feel way better about ourselves.  Instead of, like, now, everyone marches down to ground zero for the anniversary.  They call it an anniversary, which is kind of strange because isn't the anniversary supposed to be for stuff that was kind of happy?  Yeah, yeah.  Is there another way to say it for, like, tragic things when the year comes up?  I know.  Commemoration.  Yeah.  Well, meh.  But the funny thing about ground zero. 
[00:12:00]  Funny?  Well, sorry.  Got to choose my words better, I guess.  Flopper.  No president going to be there.  Yeah.  Or no presidential candidate.  Right.  We just heard this minutes before we went on the air.  The highest ranking official that's going to be at the ground zero ceremony when they read the names today is Joe Biden.  Jolton Joe Biden is going to be down there.  Whoopity fucking do.  Last year, because, and it was said on the news, it was an election year. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  You had Barack Obama and John McCain at ground zero for the reading of the names.  I told Anthony, as long as there's wars going on over 9-11, the president of the United States of America should be at ground zero every single year.  And then if the wars are over and our boys are home, then maybe there's an opportunity there where you could send a Joe Biden or whoever you want to send.  But the fact that the president isn't at ground zero this year is ridiculous as our boys and girls are still fighting wars over 9-11. 
[00:13:00]  He's taking a little trip to the Pentagon.  You know, I think he's going to walk to the Pentagon.  Probably because, yeah, but, all right, that's fine.  But here's the problem.  Barack Obama, the president, was here two days ago.  Yes.  He came to New York for the Walter Cronkite Memorial.  Yeah.  Where's his priorities?  Fuck Walter Cronkite. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Come down.  And he was an institution.  But you know what?  If you have to make a choice between coming up to New York for the Walter Cronkite Memorial or for the reading of the names at ground zero, guess what?  Yeah.  That's an easy fucking decision.  Maybe you should be in lower Manhattan.  Exactly.  If the wars were over, everyone's home, then maybe you send stupid Biden.  And he is a stupid one.  It's this, you know, what else is getting me cranky is this, it's like this Pavlov's dog reaction.  We have to hearing 9-11. 
[00:14:00]  It's become something else.  It's becoming more akin to a holiday than it is to a tragic, memorable event that should stick in your head and make you feel that emotion that you felt as it was happening.  And that's the never forget part.  That's the part where people go, you know, so unless we never forget.  It's like, no, but you do forget.  But you're fucking forgetting the horror of that day and what it meant and who did it. 
[00:14:30]  And to listen to these conspiracy assholes and all that has happened over the past eight years is just abominable to have to listen to that shit when you remember what it was like as it happened.  That was a fucking nightmare.  And then eight years later, all right, well, we'll commemorate the victims and then we'll argue over what's going to be built there.  And we'll argue over how badly we can treat Al Qaeda and the Taliban and and getting everyone out of Guantanamo. 
[00:15:00]  And and and fucking Obama bowing to fucking Middle Eastern leaders ages, just that Barack Hussein Obama is in the White House is insane thinking.  If you remember eight years ago, there would not be a president with the middle name Hussein in the White House.  It's like, what do we lose?  You go if we went to a time machine, if you went from a time machine, September 12th, 2001. 
[00:15:30]  Right. You hop in your DeLorean. You go today and go, who's the president?  Barack Hussein Obama. We lost. Holy shit. We lost the fucking war.  There's mosques everywhere. Did we lose? How did we lose the war?  With the last name that sounds way too close to Osama. Osama bin what?  He's president. Why? It's just amazing. You'd lose your fucking mind.  I just enjoy the ride, Ant. That's all I'm doing. I'm on a roller coaster. 
[00:16:00]  Don't let this shit bother you. Just enjoy the ride. It's a crazy one.  It makes me cranky. 9-11 makes me cranky. I get very about about a lot of things on on 9-11.  There's so much hypocrisy and bullshit and just general fucking, like I said, every year it's more of a holiday thing than it is a real commemoration of what happened.  Like I said, commemorate and remember the dead and the people that sacrificed their lives even to this day. 
[00:16:30]  The firefighters and emergency workers that are getting cancer, getting all kinds of lung disease.  You know, remember these guys.  Right.  But don't forget where the fuck this came from and what happened.  Right.  You know, let's try to stay a strong fucking country.  And for all the people that say we'll never forget, well, what does that mean?  What are you doing about that?  Yeah.  Are you searching out maybe one of these families that are still, you know, hurting from 9-11 or somebody that now has some kind of strange cancer because they were down there, you know, digging up all sorts of stuff and remains and getting the rubble out of the out of the area? 
[00:17:00]  No.  What are these people?  It's all over the paper.  Advertisements and whatnot.  We'll never forget.  What does that really mean?  And what are you doing to not forget what happened eight years ago?  Yeah.  And I'm not saying I'm doing anything, but I'm not running around going, we'll never forget.  Never forget. 
[00:17:30]  Never forget.  What does that actually mean to these people that, you know, are brave enough to write it in the papers today?  There is a genuine equity.  I understand what you're saying.  But there is a genuine equity in just really not forgetting.  Right.  Like, actually, regardless if you're actually doing something, the act of really not forgetting is doing something because it keeps the country together and strong and vigilant. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  No, we're on the same page.  Like, actually, as we say we'll never forget, we're discussing it.  Right.  We're getting our thoughts out there.  And maybe it makes people think.  That's all I'm saying.  When you say we'll never forget or I'll never forget, what are you doing about that?  Are you openly discussing it with your coworkers?  Are you donating to a charity?  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  You can't just say it.  You can't just say never forget.  And then tomorrow you're pumped because, you know, football season is finally here.  You know what I mean?  Exactly, man. 
[00:18:30]  Like, what are you actually doing when you say, I'll never forget, we'll never forget, don't ever forget?  That's all.  When we were watching the news before the show started, they have the lights.  The lights down there where the towers used to be.  Which, by the way, I like.  I like the lights.  They're very...  It's amazing, actually.  You can see it coming in from Long Island.  Did you see it this morning?  No, apparently they're...  I don't think they light them yet because I was looking for them.  I thought they would have been lit.  They're lit?  Travis?  Yeah, they were lit last night. 
[00:19:00]  Help a bro out.  Yeah, last night was the first night.  I didn't fucking see them.  I saw them in Brooklyn.  Might have been the rain then.  You could see them from 20 miles away.  Because I couldn't see them.  And I was looking for them because I assumed, but it's the rain.  Whatever.  I saw, we saw a little piece, a little fucking highlight reel on the lights.  And, like, over the past years, it's just been this somber thing of the lights and what they mean and everything like that. 
[00:19:30]  And now, as we're watching, they showed how the lights are set up and plugged in and what bulbs are used.  And the reporter's actually going, and these use a half a million watts of light.  Like, it became this fun thing.  Like, it's a fun story now.  Like, they're talking about the ball that drops in Times Square.  Right, and it's made out of 10,000 individual Waterford crystals.  Yeah, but they're getting away from the meaning of it and getting more to, like, just a general overall story about what it is. 
[00:20:00]  And, like I said, more of a holiday atmosphere where, oh, it's September 11th again instead of it's September 11th.  These motherfuckers took planes, killed innocent people, and changed the world as we know it, changed our country.  We're still feeling repercussions.  We live in a totally different United States of America because of what happened. 
[00:20:30]  And it's just like everyone just goes about their fucking business and looks at disciplining interrogators.  Honestly, eight years ago, seven years ago even, things like, I never would have imagined.  Never.  It's infuriating.  And what was the picture that was released recently of what's-his-name?  I can never say his name.  Oh, God.  Sheikh Mohammed. 
[00:21:00]  Khalid Mohammed.  Something, yeah.  It's the famous picture, though, where he's, did he have a mustache?  Yeah, there's two pictures of him.  Yeah, there's that one, Sheikh Mohammed.  Yeah, Sheikh Mohammed.  There's the one where they first got him, and he looks like the Dunkin' Donuts time to make the donuts guy.  With a little longer.  With, like, longer scraggly hair and the mustache.  Head head.  He's got, like, a T-shirt with the neckline really open that he's hairier than Steve.  It's ridiculous how much hair this guy has. 
[00:21:30]  And, of course, he was shaving his beard and all to kind of fit in.  Yeah, yeah.  To fit in so he wouldn't be taken in.  Right.  It's a very famous picture.  We've all seen this picture.  You look at that picture, and you're like, holy shit, that guy looks like a motherfucker that is haggard  and has probably been up a very long time with people asking him a lot of pertinent questions.  Oh, yeah, they're not letting him sleep anytime soon.  Now that a picture was just released yesterday.  Fast forward eight years, like Ant's saying.  Picture was released, I believe, yesterday or the day before yesterday. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Yeah, click on that picture right there.  There it is.  He looks like Osama bin Laden now.  The guy looks like bin Laden.  He's been allowed to grow his religious beard back.  He's wearing his headgear.  Now, this guy's still incarcerated.  He's been allowed to wear all of his garb.  They let him.  Look at him.  He's got a giant grayish salt and pepper beard.  He looks very healthy, very cleaned up, very well-slept. 
[00:22:30]  Well-rested.  Well-rested.  And it's, how fucking mad did that make me the other day?  I looked at that and went, why is he allowed to practice his fucking religion and wear that fucking headgear and the beard and everything?  Why do we allow that?  And he lost some weight.  He looks.  He looks like he's been working out.  Yeah, even though he has kind of the, it's like a mostly gray beard.  There's some black still in there.  Yeah.  He looks 10 years younger than the first one. 
[00:23:00]  Opie, he looks fantastic.  He really looks good.  Well, thank God, because I'm sure since November, he's been allowed to do whatever the fuck he wants with impunity without thinking anything's going to happen to him anymore.  Why should he worry?  Why should he worry?  He knows, you know, we've made him, we've turned him into a victim.  We've fucking turned Sheikh Khalid Mohammed into a victim. 
[00:23:30]  The guy is a victim of the Central Intelligence Agency and the FBI.  What bizarro world did we fly into?  What happened, people?  Just never forget.  Really never forget.  Not that news never forget.  Holy shit.  Just enjoy the ride.  Because it's going to get bumpy.  Let me say hi to Bob on Long Island.  Furiating.  Hello, Bob.  What's going on?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Yeah, like, you know, you give it another 10, 15 years from now, and you ask when the World Trade Center attacks happen, most people would be, oh, I don't know, maybe early October. 
[00:24:00]  They won't even know the actual date, because me personally, I don't even know the date of Pearl Harbor.  And if you ask a lot of, you know, I'm only 25.  December 7th.  A lot of young people in America.  1941.  When that happened.  Yeah, you know.  Because you were closer to it.  Yeah, he's making it was closer.  I was closer to it.  Go fuck yourself. 
[00:24:30]  Well, technically you were, though.  I mean, this kid's 25.  I was closer to the Civil War, too.  But that doesn't mean I know those dates.  He does make a good point.  I'm sure people walking around in the mid-40s were yelling, never forget, never forget, never forget.  And guess what?  Enough time goes by, you forget almost everything.  It's like Pearl Harbor, things like that.  And Anthony, before the break, I watched this whole fucking box set on the history of Manhattan from when the Dutch landed and when it was called New Amsterdam, I think, and all this crap. 
[00:25:00]  And there's been some horrific things that have happened on this island, this Manhattan island.  And I'm sure at the time when all these horrific things were happening, people were walking around going, we can't forget.  We can't forget the victims of this.  This was a very important event.  I saw the box set, and I couldn't even name a lot of these things anymore.  Somewhere in the annals of history, it's just gone, whatever event it was.  Just horrific shit.  Yeah.  And then before the show, I brought up the fact that a lot of people were waiting at the docks in New York City for the Titanic to come in. 
[00:25:30]  Whoopsie.  You know, when that didn't happen, people were like, what happened?  Yeah.  How many people?  What?  Yeah.  And that then became a ride that you blow up and put your garden hose in, and the kids slide down the deck.  Right.  And bounce off the smokestacks.  It actually became a ride.  You think it'll get that crazy with the 9-11 ever?  Who knows?  You just don't know what the future holds.  But based on the previous eight years and what I see slowly happening, faster than I like, but slowly happening, yeah, I could see in years to come it becoming some kind of a car sales event. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know, something like that.  I think we have to make it a holiday eventually.  Yeah.  So then we'll turn this into a nice day to barbecue.  Yeah, yeah.  One last barbecue day.  One last blast.  Before winter settles in here in the Northeast.  Sure.  Ah, wow.  God damn it. 
[00:26:30]  We got a lot of fucking phone calls.  Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, guys.  Long time listener.  Here, never called before.  You guys are awesome.  Just really wanted to say thank you.  You know, the days after 9-11, on 9-11, you guys were always on the radio, you know, just with the best commentary.  Sick of listening to the news.  Sick of listening, reading the papers.  It was awful.  And you guys just were unbelievable after those days.  Look, man.  We could tell a great dick joke, but I would go against any one of these fucking news channels and bring them in here. 
[00:27:00]  We would make them all look silly.  It was just basically the honest reaction of what was happening on that day.  It was insanity.  I was thinking about the show we did on 9-11 when it happened.  I've never listened to it.  I've never listened to it either.  I don't want to listen to it.  I don't either.  One of these days.  Thank you, Jeff.  Maybe one of these days we listen to it.  I want to know what we got wrong. 
[00:27:30]  I don't want to.  Yeah.  There's 18 planes in the air.  They're all headed toward us.  We could kind of.  I don't know.  Rumors, speculation.  We might have to set a day aside and listen to our original broadcast when it all was going down.  That was the day we met Sean Hannity for the first time.  I just think it came together.  Hannity was doing it from the same studio because we couldn't get into Manhattan.  Right.  So we were doing it from like, where were we?  L-I-R or D-R-E.  Farmingdale or something.  Whatever the station's now called.  Somewhere around there.  They were cool, actually.  They gave us a studio. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, gave us a studio.  And we had a little TV going for some news.  And it was pretty much just people calling up and us freaking out.  The Best, we became experts that day.  Everybody did, you know.  I think that was the first day that our listeners got to hear us being serious.  Before that, it was all just dumb dick jokes.  Hey, lick her cunt.  Lick her cunt.  And we were like, we were thrown into this role where we're like, wow, we actually got to show people that we're human beings. 
[00:28:30]  And we got a serious side to us.  Yeah.  That's when our show, not drastically changed, but we brought another element into what we do.  Yeah, yeah.  Where, you know, then when these important things go down, we're like, no, fuck the lesbian shit.  We got to talk about this.  Man to man.  Well, that was just, there was nothing else we could do at that point.  We had to just, we had to just do what we did honestly.  Just sit there and talk about, holy shit, what is going on? 
[00:29:00]  It was a holy shit broadcast.  It was.  Yeah, those lights look good.  Tribute and light.  Tribute and light.  That looks all right, man.  It is.  I was always thinking that they should have just kept the lights on all the time.  That's a, that's a, we'll never forget.  You know, you look at the sky every night and there it is, you know?  Yeah.  For, um, but for a million, uh, or a half a million Watts of lighting.  But then they would have to argue who's going to pay for it.  I don't know.  I don't pay for it.  You pay for it. 
[00:29:30]  Fuck that.  Yeah.  You know, there's always a problem.  We can't just do something in the, you know, spur of the moment.  Everything has to be, you know, thought out and.  Oh yeah.  Please.  Especially the, the 9-11 site is a prime example of that.  Why the fuck isn't something built there and done?  How many buildings have gone up?  How many buildings have we watched from an old building was there and then a brand new occupied skyscraper is in its place?  I could tell you this much.  I moved into my building two years ago and from my windows, I can see three, four, five buildings that are complete. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  They're 50 stories high.  50 story buildings.  That's in only the last.  That's only in the last two years in my dumb little neighborhood.  You know?  So it's not logistics.  It's red tape that keeps these fucking, uh, buildings from going up.  I enjoy a good bike ride, try to stay in shape.  And there's a, there's a bike path that goes along the, you know, the, the Hudson River.  Yeah.  And I can either take it all the way up to the GWB or I take it all the way down to ground zero. 
[00:30:30]  I used to go down to ground zero a lot.  I, I, every time I go down there, I can't stomach it.  Cause I see all the buildings around there are now brand new, built up, nice.  And there's still just a, a kind of a construction site down there.  Yeah.  They're sort of getting things done.  Finally.  The walk, the frigging bridge, the walking, uh, the pedestrian bridge.  Right.  Going over the West side highway is just to me, like, could you just fucking fix the dents  and holes in the goddamn thing already at this point? 
[00:31:00]  I mean, cause that's really that kind of like, why haven't they replaced that?  Give us something nice.  I don't know.  Put a fucking plaque on it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Whatever you want to do.  Like they, they, they can't decide on anything.  I really don't know.  Uh, all right.  Let's go to John in Smithtown.  John.  Hey, it really bums me out, fellas.  Cause I believe, like you say, it's turning to, it's that time of year again.  And how far are we for the nine 11 sale at Mason?  It fucking bums me out.  Yeah.  There'll be nine 11 sales and, you know, come down. 
[00:31:30]  We're taking $9,110 off of every purchase.  Yeah.  I don't think we should have the day off.  I like the work day cause it'll just turn into some fucking day that no one remembers.  And a bunch of hicks are going to get together, drink and watch a fucking NASCAR race.  At least by working and doing something like that day, you remember it that way.  And at least things keep moving.  I think I don't know.  Wow.  You really like your job.  Uh, let me say hi to David in Ohio. 
[00:32:00]  David.  Yeah.  How are you doing guys?  Hey, good.  Uh, I'm a middle school teacher actually up here in Ohio.  And, um, I was a junior in high school when it actually happened, but every year, like  the kids I'm teaching now, they were three or four years old when it actually happened.  Every year at the time, they'll actually sit there and we actually discuss about what  happened because they have no idea really what.  Yeah, it is odd to see, uh, uh, people with absolutely no recollection.  I mean, they're, they're, they're kids, um, or, or very slight recollection, not really 
[00:32:30]  feeling, uh, that emotion, uh, because they were just fucking kids.  And David, uh, in the paper today, they had an article on, uh, you know, the soldiers  that are fighting the wars, you know, and, and how most of these, not most, I'm sorry,  but there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a percentage of our soldiers that were really  young when nine, 10, 11 years old, 10, 11, 12 years old.  And they're over there fighting because of nine 11. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And, uh, but at least those guys, they're at the age where they, they actually, you  know, saw what happened.  Sure.  So they have some understanding.  I mean, it's just the kids now, they have no idea.  Right.  And of course we don't really show the footage anymore.  No, no.  No, which, you know, the thing is, I'll tell you something about, I'll tell you something  about the footage on, on television.  I, I'm glad that they don't just show that ad nauseum during that because, well, they 
[00:33:30]  you have, you have the option to look at it on the internet.  You really do.  It's like, it's like anything else.  It's a horrible fucking thing.  And it's very, um, I'm very touchy about watching that.  It's very difficult to fucking watch.  I click on those every once in a while.  Like, I want to watch these shows on like discovery and stuff about the mechanics of  it.  Right.  And how, uh, uh, you know, the building came down.  Thermite paint.  Thermite paint, which by the way, I saw a special on, on that and, uh, it could not possibly do  what he said it does.  Right. 
[00:34:00]  But again, the gatekeepers are, you know, telling us that.  But he was a governor.  The truthers know.  But he was a governor if that doesn't scare you.  Yeah, of course.  Uh, thermite paint.  Thermite paint.  Yeah.  I don't want to see it on TV because I know they would take advantage of the footage for  their own, for their own, uh, needs or whatever.  It's just disturbing.  But what I want to ask, uh, David, you're too scared to show the footage in your classroom?  Um, it's not too scared.  It's just that there'd probably be a lot of red tape and I'm sure there'd be some parents  to do with it or somebody else.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  I like having my job.  There'd be parents in there saying, why are you showing this without showing that the government  was responsible for it?  Oh, yeah.  Bullshit like that.  There is some day, the thing, the reason I don't like watching it on TV is because it's  on their schedule.  Like if something is on and, and it's, I'm flipping through the channels and I see it,  I'm like, some days I'm really not in the mood to fucking see that.  Other days I can, I can take it, um, without the gruesome details, but you know, and more  of a technical show.  I could watch that more of an emotional show. 
[00:35:00]  I, I, you know, I remember it.  I think I don't have to see that last, I think it was last year or maybe two years ago.  So, uh, CNBC, one of these stations that, you know, could do this, they went real time.  Oh, right.  And they replayed everything in real time.  In real time.  Yeah.  How, when, you know, how it was going down.  Yeah.  That was amazing to watch again.  And then the movies that came out, um, they're difficult to watch because you just know how  the fuck it ends and, and you're watching going like, oh, is this going to, we know what's 
[00:35:30]  going to happen.  Yeah.  You know, why don't, wasn't it, why doesn't he do this?  But I think the teachers should be showing this footage in, in class and discussing  it.  Well, there, that's why school is a waste of time.  Waste of time, kids.  I know you're getting ready for the school bus.  You're not going to learn anything significant today.  That's not what Obama, Obama said.  They're just going to give you busy work.  Go to school.  Waste of time.  Waste of time.  Thank you, David.  Thank you, guys.  Uh, okay.  Let me say hi to Tony. 
[00:36:00]  Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony.  Tony in Brooklyn.  Hey, we forget that, uh, nine years ago, or nine years after the 9-11, the, uh, trade  center was bombed, or, you know, that was 92 in 2001.  So next year, who knows what'll happen.  But anyway, I'm in construction sales and I'm in the pit all the time.  The only building built has been World Trade Center 7.  Uh, we're working on the memorial because that has to get done, but the Port Authority  is an absolute nightmare.  Yeah.  And Bloomberg is 100% right. 
[00:36:30]  You know, he's got to start taking a stick out and hitting all these clowns because it's  really become a shit show down there.  Yeah, it's a clusterfuck.  Nobody can figure out what they want to do.  Yep.  It's a clusterfuck.  And, uh, it's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing that eight years later, uh, there's still a fucking gaping hole in the  ground with nothing there.  It's an embarrassment to, um, the, the, uh, perpetrators of this, um, to, to the rest  of the world and to just the fucking, uh, uh, your average Americans that, that red tape 
[00:37:00]  could get so fucking in the way of, of us rebuilding something and showing, look what  we can do.  A bunch of people just waving their dicks around.  Yeah.  Put your dick back in your pants and let's get something done.  Could you imagine after Pearl Harbor, all the battleships just fucking, uh, burning  at the bottom of Pearl Harbor.  If it took eight years to decide how and when and where and why we're going to rebuild the  battleships, you know?  All right. 
[00:37:30]  Let's, uh, decide, you know, uh, as Japan is just ravaging California, but Anthony ships  can't burn when they're in water.  Well, you said at the bottom of Pearl Harbor, they're burning.  That's crazy.  They, uh, I think they, they can burn, they get pretty hot.  Actually.  Yeah.  You see those, what?  Oh, underwater volcanoes.  Yeah, I know.  It's pretty cool.  It pretty much looks like, yeah, but I mean, uh, you know, there was, there was some gumption,  uh, uh, back then.  Sure.  Where, um, now it's just, uh, uh, two sides battling it out or three sides battling it 
[00:38:00]  out and nothing getting done.  John in Nevada.  Hey there, Jan.  Hey there.  How are you doing this normal, guys?  Hi, John.  Hey, uh, my thing was that you guys in there, you know, blaming this shit on, uh, Obama  here.  What?  Because he hasn't been down there.  Well, how many times did that idiot Bush go down there?  All right, look, I'm not trying to make this a Republican Democrat thing because I'm sick  of that shit.  No, my point was very, my point was very easy. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Bush should have been down there too.  I don't give a shit who the fucking president is.  Every year, the president of the United States should be at ground zero until the wars are  over at the very fucking least.  Yeah.  I'm not making this a Democrat versus Republican bullshit thing.  I'm talking generally.  I mean, Obama's sitting there with his shit sandwich that Bush gave him from eight years  of whatever the hell happened in there.  I'd be over for that.  See, this is why nothing will ever get done.  I know.  Because now you got to blame, you know, it's...  How long do you blame the past administration?  I'm not talking about any of that shit today, all right? 
[00:39:00]  Barack Obama was in town.  Barack Obama was in town two days ago.  Like, the ride home was a nightmare because they close off literally half of Manhattan  when the president shows up.  I mean, it's like lockdown.  And to know that he came up for the memorial for Walter Cronkite and a mere two, three days  later, he's not up here for, you know, the ground zero ceremony, whatever the fuck you  want to call it, the reading of the names, that's ridiculous in my eyes.  I'm sorry, as he expects, you know, our men and women to fight these wars overseas. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  You should be doing your part.  And he's kind of like trying to save face because he knows that.  So he's doing the Pentagon thing today.  Yeah, a little drive around the block.  But you know what?  No, the main action is here.  Yeah.  Every year.  You send Joe Biden.  No, you got to be here.  And by the way, if you could get your ass up here for Walter Cronkite, you could get  your ass up here for the reading of the names.  He could do both.  It's not like he's got a book of flight, you know?  Yeah.  Stop there. 
[00:40:00]  Stop here.  And it's not a I hate Barack Obama thing.  No.  You know, if we're still fighting the wars four years from now and Barack's out of office,  whoever the fuck the president is then should be here as well.  Yeah.  Get your ass down there.  God, that guy.  We got a stat here.  Gary in Bayshore.  Gary?  Hey, Gary.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, Anthony, what grade was your girlfriend in September 11?  Fourth?  Fourth grade.  No. 
[00:40:30]  She was 10 years old, right?  She would have to be 10 years old when 9-11 happened.  If she is your girlfriend, I don't know.  The girl you brought to your high school reunion.  Let's just leave it at that.  10 years old?  She was 10 years old.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  She was 10.  Oh, well, I'll fill her in on what happened.  All right.  Want to regroup?  We'll take our first break.  Yeah, we could do that.  We're going to do other things today because we got news on the, is she a South African runner? 
[00:41:00]  She, she, he, he.  She, he, he.  She, he, she, she, she, he, she.  Yeah, that is some kind of fucking freak.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  Holy shitcakes.  Larry King is on hold to talk about that.  What?  Yeah.  Wow.  How does Larry prepare for his own show?  Maybe that's why he sucks so bad.  Because instead of preparing for his show, he's calling our show all the time.  Didn't know he was an Uber fan.  Yes.  Nice.  So we got lots to do today.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:41:30]  Na, na, na, na, na.  The 9-11 coverage continues on all your local TV stations.  I was telling Anthony, I love, I love 9-11 for this reason.  The newscasters, especially locally.  Yeah.  They look so stupid every year on 9-11.  Because for once, they can't use their reading machine.  Yeah.  And they actually have to talk from the soul, the heart.  Can't work without reading machine. 
[00:42:00]  And you get to see how stupid and dumb they really are.  Yeah, when they try to off the cuff tell how they feel.  Yeah, no, they're way better, like, trying to hula hoop and dance and, you know, dance Fridays and whatever other horse shit they're doing.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  They're all doing morning zoo radio from the late 80s.  They're bullshit.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  Knowing Obama came out for Walter Cronkite but not today is really driving me nuts.  That was my trigger. 
[00:42:30]  That's my trigger right there.  Yeah.  Right there.  For Walter Cronkite, he was an institution, yes.  Yeah, but, I mean, you know, you could send a card.  And we get Biden today.  No, you should have the president, no matter who, is in office being here every year until the wars are over, at the very least.  And, Anthony, you were making a good point because people always have to make it a political thing.  Well, Obama inherited Bush's horse shit.  Yeah, that's what you heard. 
[00:43:00]  He inherited Bush's shit sandwich.  But explain what you were saying during the break.  Yeah, if you go back to when George W. was elected, the Republicans did nothing but talk about how they inherited fucking Bill Clinton's shit sandwich.  And if you go back before that, you know, when Bill Clinton got elected, you hear the Democrats talk about how he inherited George Bush Sr.'s fucking shit sandwich.  So it doesn't matter what side you're on.  You're always going to blame the last president that was in there for what you're going through for at least the first year of your presidency. 
[00:43:30]  And sometimes for your entire fucking presidency.  I don't know when it ends.  I remember Rush Limbaugh yelling and screaming every day that Bush Jr. there inherited all of Clinton's shit.  Of Bill Clinton's crap.  And it was Bill Clinton's fault that this and that and that.  Well, you know, both sides are guilty of doing it.  And at some point, just, you got to, now it's your job.  Now it's your fucking job.  You think that when, you know, the new guy steps into fucking General Motors or Ford or Chrysler after all this fucking shit's going on, he's going, well, it was pretty fucked up. 
[00:44:00]  You know, we were broke and the last guy that was in there, it's like, I know.  That's why the last guy ain't here anymore.  Yeah.  Now fix the fucking shit.  Oh, and on the way in today, I was listening to 1010 Wins.  Obama's coming back Monday.  Oh, is he?  Because look at this one.  It's already been a year that Wall Street collapsed, that big collapse that freaked out everybody last year.  That's a year already.  Oh, wow.  So he's coming back for that Monday. 
[00:44:30]  How about you camp out in a hotel?  You could do the Walter Cronkite.  You could do the Ground Zero.  And then you could talk to the Wall Street people.  Because he's going to be giving his speech on, you know, health care and whatnot.  He's doing that.  He's going around doing that.  Yeah, but he doesn't have to worry about, you know, flights being overbooked.  No, no.  He can make it any time he needs to.  He can go wherever the fuck he wants on a moment's notice.  Let me say hi to Tom in Madison.  Tom.  Hey, morning, buddy.  Hey.  I think people do forget those people holding hands, you know, jumping out of those buildings. 
[00:45:00]  I'm with Ant.  I can't watch that stuff.  I mean, my dad was an eight smoke for 42 years.  He was a firefighter.  Another one I lost.  My mom, that's the only time I ever saw him cry.  And we were so sad for New York, this country.  I mean, we were so sad.  And this might be a stretch, but I was so proud personally.  And when that damn guy landed that plane in the river and the way New York responded, I mean, it just, I went, man, they got it back. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, but we got it back.  For a few seconds.  For a few seconds.  And then we ruined that because then there had to be a horrendous tragedy over the Hudson River anyway.  And Chuck Schumer's got to get him in.  Out here in the hunter lands of Wisconsin, though, I'm telling you, we felt you guys.  I mean, like, you wouldn't, you know, it just, it wasn't the news coverage.  It was those firefighters.  It was those people that spoke at that rally, you know, where Melissa Etheridge sang. 
[00:46:00]  And, you know, we were with you.  We were with you.  I think the world was with you.  Yeah, I don't really, I appreciate that, but I don't like hearing that because I think 9-11, no, I don't think.  9-11, you know, affected everybody, no matter where you live.  We just happened to live closer to where it all went down.  So we have a little.  That was creepy.  The police officer that said, kiss my fat Irish ass.  I mean, that's what we were all feeling.  You were.  Fat, white American asses. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, you're not going to hear that anytime soon.  I appreciate it.  No.  No.  Because that guy would be reprimanded big time.  Probably lose his job for saying that.  You know.  I'll be all missed.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  See ya.  All right.  Oh, Jimmy.  He would probably have to sit down with HR if he did it today.  Yeah.  He'd sit down with HR.  You can't say that.  You're offending people.  Right.  Oh, we've only gotten more politically correct.  And it's so, ugh.  All right.  Let's go to Rape Kid.  He's been waiting over an hour.  Oh, Rape Kid.  There's other things happening in the world today.  We're not going to forget about the 9-11 thing. 
[00:47:00]  We're going to continue weaving in and out of that topic all day long today.  Yeah.  Rape Kid, what do you got?  Hello, boys.  Well, I'd love to go to, you know, take you guys out to the World Trade Center Memorial.  Oh.  Oh, it's not there right now.  It hasn't been built yet.  Anyway, I'm telling you guys that it's official that this South African runner, Kastur Semenya,  it has a poon and a peener, also has no womb, no ovaries, and interior testicles. 
[00:47:30]  It has interior testicles, which are nice.  What?  Yeah.  Well, because if the weather gets bad, you can just roll.  It's like a convertible.  Interior testicles.  The South African sprinter.  Yeah.  And when she was asked, she was asked, you know, why did you lie about your sexual identity?  And she said, I'm not lying.  She clicked.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying. 
[00:48:00]  Internal testicles.  I was thinking about this story on the way in, too.  The mistake she made, the she-he, was showing off her male abs.  That man abs.  Like, she should have had a shirt covering up her belly, because that's what made everyone go, wait a minute.  What the fuck?  I know some women are ripped out there, but they can't get abs like that.  And the fucking mustache.  And the mustache, she probably should have shaved.  Shave, biatch.  But they can't really take her medals away, because she's like a he-she.  Well, no, I think they're- 
[00:48:30]  But they're saying that she's not going to be allowed to really run in competition anymore.  Because they don't know what category to put her in.  Yeah, they're looking at it as to whether she can keep, it can keep its medals.  Right.  The Lady Gaga category.  Yeah.  The Lady Gaga's like a he-she, too, supposedly?  Yeah, that's-  I think that's big clip.  I think they're looking at, they're going to look at Serena Williams next.  This ain't stopping with the South African sprinter.  We're going to, we should get a list together. 
[00:49:00]  Other females that really need to be looked that closely.  They have to take a look.  Take a little look-see.  A little look-see.  So she doesn't have ovaries, she doesn't have a womb, and her testes are inside her body?  Yeah, that's more man.  Yeah, apparently this is in the Daily News.  I'd say that's more man than woman.  And three times the amount of testosterone that normal women have.  Jesus.  So I would say that's a dude that, like, the organs didn't kind of-  Drop?  Drop, get-yeah.  Yeah.  Is that real right there? 
[00:49:30]  I don't want to look at her hermaphrodites today.  That's a penis, but then the testicles-  Please, for the love of God.  Like, where the middle of your ball sack would be is a vagina.  Yeah.  For the love of God.  Please, Daddy, no.  Geez.  Well, Rape Kid, thank you.  Oh, by the way, other thing in the sports world, I didn't get a chance to call the other  day, but you want to look for douchey clips of other sportscasters that match John Sterling.  Yeah.  If you want to try and find one, I don't know if anyone can- no one can post it on YouTube, 
[00:50:00]  apparently, but if you look for Chris Boomer Berman, he's been doing NFL highlights on ESPN  for years.  He's a good highlight announcer.  Wait, you're trying to tell us about Chris Berman?  We all know Chris Berman.  Yeah.  But you ever hear some of the douchey nicknames he gives all the football players when he's  doing the highlight reel?  No.  Yeah, he kind of started that whole thing.  I think he started the nickname thing or put it in the mainstream.  Yeah.  I don't remember any offhand, but yeah, he gets a little douchey with the nicknames, too.  One really bad one, Reggie Wayne, he's a star receiver in Indianapolis, and he says, Reggie 
[00:50:30]  Stately Wayne Manor.  Oh, no.  Yep.  Every time.  Huh.  All right.  That's just the tip of the iceberg, Ed.  I can give you other players that you might know, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.  That's a bad one.  Thank you, sir.  Larry King checking in, Anthony.  What?  As we find out, the South African sprinter is a he-she, basically. 
[00:51:00]  Hemaphrodite.  Yeah.  No womb, no ovaries, and testes inside her body.  That was weird.  I still say her, I guess.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It.  Say it.  Larry, it's a pleasure.  Two days in a row.  Larry.  Hey, how we doing?  Larry King here.  Yeah.  Hi, Larry.  How important is the cunt muscle?  What is the cunt muscle?  Answer, question, answer, anyone?  Thank you, Larry.  We'll mull that over.  Uh, Larry King on line four here.  Larry.  I just want to take a second to say it contains no sugar, no starch. 
[00:51:30]  Happy birthday to little Jimmy Norton with garlic.  Garlic, of course.  Yeah.  How important are the ovaries?  Go.  Apparently not very when it comes to running, because this thing doesn't have any.  How important is my fucking brain?  Again, not important, because you don't seem to have one.  Thank you, Larry.  I got to let you go, because Larry King is on line one.  Larry.  Wow.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening, Larry. 
[00:52:00]  That runner has a vaginus.  Vaginus.  Wow.  Larry.  Let me go to Matt from the NYFD.  Matt.  Hey, what's up, guys, man?  These Larry King guys are hilarious.  Yeah, what's up, Matt?  My mom pissed off that within a year, two baseball stadiums get built with no problem.  And eight years passed, they only had the plan for this damn, you know, World Trade Center building.  What do you guys think about that?  Yeah, that's a pretty good point right there. 
[00:52:30]  We built two brand new state-of-the-art stadiums within the last, what, two years, maybe?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, two goddamn giant stadiums.  Where's our priorities at?  Where's the priorities at for New York City?  Look, I, you know, I mean, I'm a huge Mets fan.  Not a huge Mets fan.  That's not fair, because I barely watched this year, to be honest with you.  But, yeah, over the years, though, a big-time Mets fan.  And we've needed a stadium for, I don't know, 15 years at this point.  So, it's nice to have a new stadium.  But. 
[00:53:00]  But, come on.  But we could have maybe got ground zero figured out before we get a couple new stadiums in the New York area.  They got all that shit figured out in that amount of time.  Do you think these union workers have anything to do with it, like postpone it?  Because there's nothing but money going on down there right now?  I don't know.  I think it's the transit authority.  It's the fucking, there's so many hands in the till that, you know, it's just too much red tape, too much crap going on.  Yeah, I really don't.  It's not like when, it's, you know what it is?  It's not like when, let's say, Donald Trump goes, I want to make a bill, I want to build a building. 
[00:53:30]  I'm going to buy some property, and then I'm going to fucking, you know, get some investors, and I'm going to build a building.  This involves the city fucking jersey, you know, the transit authority.  It's just, um, the port-a-thon, there's too much shit going on.  And, you know, the government agencies, they can't get anything fucking done.  Yeah, at this point, eight years is a joke.  I mean, a couple years go by, you kind of understand a little bit. 
[00:54:00]  But now, eight years in, it's just ridiculous.  You got to at least expect another four or five.  Oh, please.  Well, they were, I mean, there was a point where they're like, all right, we will get this done in time for the 10th anniversary.  And now, it came out only recently.  Well, we'll have the memorial definitely done for the 10-year anniversary.  Yeah, the memorial.  That means the rest of the shit will be, like you're saying, you know, at least another four or five years.  They actually had to, uh, you remember when they placed the cornerstone?  Fucking Pataki was down there for that. 
[00:54:30]  Governor Pataki was down there for that one.  And, uh, yeah.  In the meantime, we've had Spitzer after that.  I was going to say, that means Elliot Spitzer was still in office banging broads.  Oh, banging broads like crazy.  Uh, yeah.  Pataki went down there.  They placed the cornerstone.  And then, while they're building or doing whatever they're doing down there, they moved it into storage.  And it's been sitting in storage.  And now, they're taking it out.  And they're going to put it on display somewhere, I believe, maybe?  Long Island or something?  Wait, the cornerstone isn't...  They place it, have a big ceremony. 
[00:55:00]  Ugh.  And then, they get it the fuck out of there.  I hate those fake ceremonies where the politician is in his suit with his...  With his shiny shovel?  Shiny shovel and the hard hat or the big scissors.  Yeah.  I hate all that crap.  Hoopla.  It's called hoopla.  Dumb hoopla.  It's pomp and circumstance.  It's stupid.  It is stupid.  You should make them work a day, uh, you know, in the construction site.  Actually work.  How funny would that be where someone really takes it serious?  You know, the politician.  Politician goes down there and they're like, no, you're not just doing one stupid... 
[00:55:30]  What are you doing?  ...shovel of really nice soil.  Where's my shiny shovel?  No, you take the dirty one, put it in this wheelbarrow, load it up, and then cart it out on this plank.  Yeah, over and over again, all day long.  The photo op of all the guys, like, they're kind of hunched over, and they have a teaspoon of dirt inside the shiny shovel,  and then they go, okay, and go, and then they throw the dirt, and they're off in their limos.  No, I would have respect for a politician that goes, no, I'm here to get dirty.  I'm doing a day's work down there, boys.  Rolling up my shirt sleeves.  That's right. 
[00:56:00]  My overalls.  Headed into the city now, thanks.  All right, Matt.  Thank you, Matt.  Well, Larry's checking in, Anthony.  Larry King.  Hi, Larry.  Larry King.  Larry.  You're on the air.  Hello, boys.  Hi, Larry.  Hi, Larry.  Turn your hearing aid up.  Yeah.  Did you dance around like Buffalo Bill during your victory lap?  Cue the Cue Lazarus music. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you, boys.  All right, Larry.  Thank you, Larry.  Larry King.  Oh.  Oh.  Anthony, this is.  I'd fuck me.  Would you fuck me?  Question.  Would you fuck me?  Answer.  I would fuck me.  Anthony, this is unbelievable, but we have Eddie Murphy checking in.  What?  It's been a long time since we've heard from Eddie Murphy.  Eddie Murphy, you're on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, boys.  It's been a long time, really.  You know, I was wondering maybe if you had that sprinter's phone number, if I could get it.  And also, if you think that I might be able to outrun her if I had to chase her down.  What do you think?  Uh, wow.  That's going back.  Eddie Murphy, uh, rumors he had a penchant for, um, trannies.  And I do.  I love him.  I love him.  I love him.  I can't get enough of them.  I love your movies, uh, Mr. Murphy.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:57:30]  But Eddie Murphy and Eddie Murphy.  Oh, really?  He's doing another dual role?  Why don't we say hi to, uh, Larry King.  Larry.  Larry.  Yeah, I wondered.  Well, no, if she, it doesn't have ovaries, it wouldn't have a period.  Right.  So, uh, but internal testes.  I'll just get her Elmo.  No.  Oh, I get it.  Cause Elmo's red. 
[00:58:00]  Uh, but testes, internal testes.  Are they functional?  I wonder.  Do they, what about a prostate?  Prostate's very important.  Um, does the runner have a prostate?  Because then the clear stuff can come out.  Well, let's hold her down and cut her open and see what the fuck's going on.  All right.  I'm into a dissection.  Uh, Larry, a union worker, not Larry King.  Oh.  Uh, I, I knew this was going to happen.  That's why we said, I have no fucking idea what's going on with the unions and ground zero.  Larry, what do you got on this?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Larry.  The biggest problem is the fact that the Port Authority is managing everything down there. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  And the red tape, like Anthony said, in order, even to access the site, you have to be escorted on and off the site.  Amazing.  Because it's a secure site.  And also, part of, most of the building is underground.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta remember, you're coming from, what, 40, 40 feet below ground level?  Yep.  Building your way up.  So, they're laying still now, and it's not the union guys that's the problem.  It's more red tape than anything. 
[00:59:00]  And that's the biggest headache of the Port Authority.  I think I know that much.  Yeah.  All right.  You never get a government agency that's going to work as well as a private endeavor.  Because the guy, if you're like a guy, a builder, and I bring up Trump again, if you're a guy like Trump, you want to get that building done as quickly as possible and start making money off of it.  If you're a government agency, it doesn't matter.  There's no individual that's going, um, I'm the government.  I need money.  So, it becomes just this friggin' entity that doesn't know how to, doesn't care about how fast something gets done. 
[00:59:30]  When Donald Trump was a friend of the show before there was a misunderstanding and something was misquoted and put in a paper.  Yeah.  And then Donald Trump, you know, changed his tune as far as Ant and I go.  That, to this day, is unbelievable.  We were joking saying how Donald Trump needed us for, I forgot exactly what the controversy was.  There was something about his show and promoting it.  And then they fucking reprinted it in the paper as a fact instead of a joke like it was meant to be. 
[01:00:00]  Some rag.  It was too bad because I kind of like Donald calling in on the show.  Yeah.  He was yelling and screaming about how ridiculous this Ground Zero thing was years ago.  So, if he was in charge of that thing?  Years ago.  Get it right back up.  He said it would have been done a long, long time ago.  Towers right back up there.  Uh, we got Larry King checking in, Anthony.  Larry!  Surprise.  Hello, Mr. Kumi.  How are you today?  Very good, Mr. King.  How did you avoid tripping on your cock?  Of a runner. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, the runner, yes.  Is it the runner or Anthony's time?  I'm getting out, boys.  Have a great evening.  All right.  You're Mr. King.  Uh, Andy Rooney is checking in.  Andy Rooney?  Yeah, I think he's a little jealous that Larry King's getting a lot of attention on our show.  Uh, Mr. Rooney, it's a pleasure.  Yes.  Do you ever wonder, when the runner masturbates, is it double your pleasure or double your fun?  All right, that could, I don't know how you would do that, internally, externally. 
[01:01:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what the gadgetry is down in that runner's lap.  Yeah, we don't have a clue, but maybe Larry has something on this.  Larry!  Hi, Opie and Dopey!  I'm funny, Larry.  Never been done before.  Anyway, guys, I just wanted to say, is it key if you fuck it because you can't see the balls?  Good question.  That's a very good question.  Now, with the internal testicles, is it gay if you fuck it if you can't see the balls? 
[01:01:30]  That's always the best question, boys.  Punch it out.  Thank you, Mr. King.  They didn't have to go through all that testing with this thing.  Just pull the pants down.  All he had to do was smell it.  Smell it.  You think it's just going to be man?  It either smells like man or woman.  Well, let me do this because there is another option.  Oh, Jesus.  Wah-nah, wah-nah, wah-nah.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, that thing is, I don't know.  They don't give you enough details.  Like, I'm surprised they gave us that many details about there being no ovaries, there being internal testicles.  But they don't really tell about a schlong, about a vag, about the ever, ever important prostate.  Which, you know, a lot of the male hormones come from the prostate.  So if it doesn't have a prostate, where is it from?  Is it, where do the hormones come from?  I don't know.  I need to know more. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  I can't help you.  I'm sorry.  I can't help you.  Let's go to Josh in Philly.  Josh.  Hey there, Josh.  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up, Josh?  Hey, I just want to tell you.  I have actually a six-year-old who is in school and watched the Obama speech the other day.  But he is not learning about 9-11 whatsoever.  We went to an open house at this school, and there's nothing to do with 9-11, nor are they saying anything about it to him, 
[01:03:00]  because they are scared that it will frighten him.  Not only frighten the children, I absolutely know what's going on with this whole thing.  9-11, people don't want it taught in schools because it comes off as looking racist and takes these children,  these impressionable children, and makes them start thinking, hey, you know something?  These Arabs, Muslims, seem like bad people, and you want to keep that away from the little children, 
[01:03:30]  even though they were all Arab Muslims, but, you know, you've got to keep that away from the children.  So how do you teach it without telling them who did this?  And then you'll have the conspiracy nuts saying, well, you're teaching this, the government story.  It really is so disturbing.  Who do you fall, the school system, the parents?  Well, I guess the school system for keeping it safe and not wanting to have any controversy. 
[01:04:00]  But then they get in hot water if they start teaching that, and everyone wants to keep their jobs.  So, again, it becomes this big entity that is keeping people from telling the truth to the kids.  Look at what's on TV, though.  He sees what's on TV, and he sees everything that's going on, and he asks me,  and then he goes to school and asks his teacher, what is his teacher going to say?  Oh, no, that didn't happen.  Yeah, it didn't happen. 
[01:04:30]  That didn't happen.  No one died that day.  You know, people didn't jump out of a fucking building.  Did we start persecuting the Jews when we found out an iceberg sunk the Titanic?  No.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Josh, how old is your kid?  My kid is six years old.  Okay.  I'm not a parent, so I don't know.  But the question I would ask, how old do you think a kid should be before you talk about this 9-11 stuff?  I mean, it could be pretty scary for a six-year-old, I'm just assuming.  It is scary for him because he is six, but the problem is that he walks past the TV, and he sees what's going on on TV, or, you know, all the newspapers today. 
[01:05:00]  They ask a lot of questions.  Yeah.  Yeah, they do ask a lot of questions.  Bip, bip, bip, bip, bip.  Well, don't shut up.  Are you one of those good parents where you actually, you know, teach your kids stuff, or you just try to let the school teach your kids everything?  No, I try to teach them stuff.  Thank God.  Thank God.  No, you've got to be like my dad.  Just tell him, shut up, and do as I say, not as I do, and mind your own business. 
[01:05:30]  Don't bust my chops was another one that I never really used to understand.  And this place looks like a bomb hit it.  That's a Twitter page.  There you go.  What, what, what, someone help me out.  It's a funny fucking, uh.  Really?  Yeah, things my dad.  Oh, it's a, it's shit my dad says.  Shit my dad says?  It's hilarious.  Really?  Wow.  It's really funny.  On Twitter, it's just like that, right?  Twitter.com slash shit my dad says.  I wasn't ripping them off or nothing.  Shit my dad says. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, it's a very funny, very funny Twitter page.  Hey, hey, your boy, your boy should have phoned it in today.  You could have had the day off if you just played the 9-11 show.  No kidding.  Ah, yes.  God, I love this, Josh.  Might have alarmed people.  Josh helping us do less radio.  No, less more gooder.  Josh understands.  Thank you, sir.  Watch out, boys.  You have a great day.  Speaking of less radio, this is a, this is a privilege right here, Ant.  Howard Stern checking in.  Wow.  Uh, Howard.  Uh, uh, yeah, good evening. 
[01:06:30]  Uh, uh, I invented tiny peeners.  Ooh.  Good evening.  He sounded like Alfred Hitchcock saying good evening.  Oh, my God.  Governor Patterson is delivering remarks at Ground Zero today.  Well, they told him to go down there because the building's done.  Yeah, he's actually saying, look at this amazing structure behind me.  Eight short years later, and we have rebuilt.  He has no idea.  If I was his handler, man, I would, oh, boy, would I blow it for myself, but it would be  a doozy.  I'd go, hey, governor, you got to go down there. 
[01:07:00]  The buildings are finally done.  Yeah, it's great.  You're going to be cutting the ribbon, and people are going to be walking to work inside  those buildings for the first time today.  The front door's right there.  Keep walking forward.  He just falls into the pit.  How do you have a blind fucking governor?  You have a blind governor.  And I know we have some blind listeners, but, you know.  Jiminy Cricket.  How do you really see what's going on?  I don't know.  He did shave a little bit, though.  He's not as grubby as he used to be.  He kept the mustache, but.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, all right. 
[01:07:30]  Let's see what else we got here.  Let me say hi to Larry King, Anthony.  Larry!  Wow.  Pastor Samir, have you thought about running this mayor's stew?  Yeah.  Mayor's stew.  Nice.  Ah.  Ah, we should be moving twice as fast to rebuild.  Yes, of course we should.  I agree with you, Big Pig.  Open the valve.  Hang on.  Big Pig, go ahead.  Hey, hey.  Hey.  Give you a moment on the radio. 
[01:08:00]  Go ahead.  Hi, sir.  You're on.  Big Pig, you.  Oh, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Listen, man, I got to tell you.  I can understand where you guys are coming from, but you know what?  If there's one time where there shouldn't be any red tape, it's over this.  I understand the private industry works faster, but everybody should be fucking coming together  because the fact that it's taken us so fucking long makes us look like the laughingstock  of the entire fucking world.  That's exactly what I was saying earlier.  We look stupid in the eyes of the world.  That shouldn't matter. 
[01:08:30]  The more important thing is that we should be able to get this thing built quickly, but  it's just red tape, like you said.  And this, by the way, is a prime example of government agencies trying to get things done,  coming up with a dollar figure and a time frame.  It will never work because shit like this gets in the way.  You think the rest of the world's just going, look at those stupid Americans that can't  figure this one out?  Yeah, those dumb frogs that have that Eiffel Tower back up.  Scott.  Dummies.  Hey, guys. 
[01:09:00]  Hey.  Did either of you happen to see the beginning of the football game last night?  I thought it was awfully douchey.  They took relatives of people who had died in Flight 93, brought them out on the field  at the Steelers game, brought them out there and said, hey, here are the people who lost  relatives on Flight 93.  They all had them in Steelers jerseys with 93 on it.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God, I thought it was the most douchey thing I've ever seen.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I mean.  No way. 
[01:09:30]  Did they do that?  I mean, bring them out.  I can't believe that.  To put jerseys on them.  With the number of the, ooh, that is creepy.  Yeah, I did not see that.  I know the Steelers won in overtime.  When did that fucking game end?  Oh, it was late.  Yeah.  It was late.  But this was the pregame.  You know, they did their, they did their, let's remember, you know,  Flight 93 crashed not far from here.  Here are some relatives.  About seven or eight, nine of them, all with 93 on a Steelers jersey.  Unbelievable.  Creepy. 
[01:10:00]  All right, but now, guys.  Yeah, that's a little weird.  Ew.  Let me say hi to Tracy Morgan.  Tracy.  Tracy.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Tracy.  Hey, do you think that one that can prolapse the penis?  Prolapse the penis.  I want to diddle it.  Yeah.  I love how the celebrities are calling in lately.  This is great.  Well, you know, we're a hit show, Ant.  It's about time.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  Hello, gentlemen. 
[01:10:30]  Hi, Larry.  What I want to know is if the governor goes down there, how the hell is he going to see anything?  Oh, Larry.  Don't call it.  Boo!  I sure hope he didn't destroy the Larry King call.  Yeah, no kidding.  How does the governor shave?  He has someone shave for him.  No fucking way.  Come on, yeah.  Look at that.  Go funny eye.  You can't be sporting the, you know, the stylish sideburns if you're shaving yourself. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, and you can't have, like, an even sideburns or an even mustache if you shave yourself.  Does someone shave him?  Does he, like, lay back in a chair and someone shaves him?  You gotta think.  He's got a Kenny.  No, I don't.  On this show?  He's got a Kenny.  He's got a Kenny.  I'll shave you.  Yeah.  Well, Titty Mountain Highway has become one of the many things.  I can't stand, I'm officially going on record as saying, I can't stand this. 
[01:11:30]  Why?  I can't fucking stand this fucking song.  Titty Mountain Highway.  Bob Kelly doing this, it annoys me.  Why?  It's chalk on a blackboard.  Oh, so you don't want bands coming up with their own version of Titty Mountain Highway anytime soon, Ed?  Oh, boy.  And go. 
[01:12:00]  Didn't see that coming.  Now that I know it bothers you, I was toying with this last night.  I'm like.  Now it's a done deal.  Do we have something there?  I wasn't really sure.  I was like, eh, going back and forth.  But now that I know.  I say chalk on a blackboard.  I don't know.  Now that I know it annoys you, I say, you know, the bands come up with their own version of Titty Mountain Highway.  Yeah.  Could have a lot of genres.  It certainly can.  Ugh.  Listen to this.  Elzner Ruffino presents Bob Kelly's Titty Mountain Highway Tour. 
[01:12:30]  The Titty Mountain Highway.  Head down the Titty Mountain Highway with Bob Kelly's Titty Mountain Highway Tour.  Featuring the smash hit song, Titty Mountain Highway, from the platinum-selling album, Titty Mountain Highway.  Titty Mountain Highway.  It's Bob Kelly's Titty Mountain Highway Tour.  Rolling down the Titty Mountain Highway to a city near you.  Tickets on sale now.  Rolling along.  Rolling along.  By the way, his first version, way better than the second version. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  But we're acknowledging the second version for some reason.  I got to say, I appreciate it a little more with the production behind it.  Okay.  Because they put a little, you know, they put a little reverb on the voice, a little slap  back, and with the music back there.  It's not just like him screaming into a microphone.  I was ready to beat him with my headphones.  Wait till you hear all the versions.  And he's calling it the Teddy Mountain Highway?  Bob Kelly himself.  Bob Kelly could be.  Is calling it the Teddy Mountain Highway.  I want to say that Bob Kelly is officially the stupidest comic that does our show. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Hold on.  I know, Rich Voss.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop.  Because everyone has, everyone hears it as Titty Mountain Highway.  It really does sound like Titty Mountain Highway.  And there's a lot there.  The Titty Mountain Highway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now he's on his, now he's on his dumb Twitter page going, no, it's the Teddy Mountain Highway.  There's no bit, Bob, if it's the Teddy Mountain Highway.  Yeah, what does that mean?  What does it mean, you idiot? 
[01:14:00]  It's Titty Mountain Highway.  Titty is good because it's titties, it's a mountain, and it's like a highway.  Right.  And it's old school rock where you just talked about boozing and drugging and tits.  Yeah.  Lots and lots of tits.  Do you hear Teddy in there?  No.  I hear Titty.  What a fucking idiot. 
[01:14:30]  Bob Kelly's an idiot.  He finally has a bit that has some legs.  Yeah.  I really could see more production coming from this and maybe a few bands getting involved.  And now he's saying it's Teddy.  Don't make a Teddy Mountain Highway song because we're not going to play it.  It's Titty.  Listen.  On the Teddy Mountain Highway.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Teddy Mountain Highway. 
[01:15:00]  Roadin' along.  Teddy Mountain Highway.  Oh, we got a few other ones. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Daddy's hands up.  Send him down.  Travis going bald.  Steve's going bald.  It works for the show that's the Teddy Mountain Highway. 
[01:16:00]  Of course it does.  With the whole Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  And he did it on Wednesday.  Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  It's a little cooler.  He's mentioning all the show members.  We're hearing Kenny Mountain Highway.  Kenny Mountain Highway.  Sounds like Kenny Mountain Highway.  Someone else said Petty Mountain Highway.  Bobby.  Yo. 
[01:16:30]  You're officially the stupidest comic that does the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  And because of that, I'm not fucking fly fishing with you.  Oh, no.  First of all, settle down, stupid.  I'm trying to help you out, so don't tell me to settle down.  It's Teddy Mountain Highway.  It's not Teddy Mountain Highway.  Well, like Pearl Jam once said, I'm not going to tell you what the song means or what really,  you know, because I want you to interpret it.  Your own interpretation.  Bobby, you got...  I want you to have your own interpretation.  So, yeah, dude, if it's Teddy Mountain Highway, it's Teddy Mountain Highway. 
[01:17:00]  Well, change your Twitter page.  Teddy Mountain Highway works.  Teddy Mountain Highway doesn't.  You finally...  You got a bit that has some legs on this show, so don't ruin it right now.  I think you just did, Opie.  Huh?  I think you just did.  No.  We could turn this thing around.  I'm telling you.  Comment coming in.  Bob Kelly, the singer of A.C. Douchey. 
[01:17:30]  A.C. Douchey.  A.C. Douchey.  Bobby, this production come in.  There's like a concert promo piece we just played.  We have a live version of Tiddy Mountain Highway.  Then we check your Twitter page and it says Teddy Mountain Highway.  Teddy?  Who's Teddy?  As in the Ted character?  No.  I'm trying to get to the little kids.  We're going to switch it over.  We're going to get the adults with the titty and we're going to hit the young kids.  Oh, it's the fucking A.M. mix.  Oh, look.  When you have to play Ed Sullivan, you can change it to Teddy Mountain Highway.  Linger Linger.  I want to hit everybody. 
[01:18:00]  I don't want to hit just the creeps.  I want to hit middle school.  All right, Bobby.  Apologize on your Twitter page and say, oh, my God.  Yeah, it is Teddy Mountain Highway.  Because now we've got bands that are possibly going to record their version.  This has legs.  It's titty.  I fucked up, dude.  All right.  You know, sometimes on the iPhone.  All right, good.  When you write, the T is right next to the E is right next to the I on the iPhone.  This is true.  All right.  It works.  It works with titty Mountain Highway. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, we want it to be titty.  All right.  Could it be titty?  Okay.  It's titty.  All right.  All right.  How was the show last night?  You're going to hang up with me.  What do you think?  I'm fucking stupid?  Oh, my God.  Actually, this time I wasn't.  His hand wasn't even on the mouse.  He's just kind of hanging, talking to you.  Because I listened to you, Bobby.  Paranoid fuck.  You're like, I need.  You told me I need friends, you know.  So I was like, you know what?  Okay.  I'll ask him how the gig was last night because he was in here promoting it on Wednesday.  Good, friendly question.  And was I anywhere near the mouse? 
[01:19:00]  No, that's why I was like, oh, my God.  He wasn't even near the fucking mouse.  It's right there now, isn't it?  No, Bobby.  That would be very obvious.  How was the gig?  It was fucking...  God damn.  Bravo.  You're going to be in a stream all by yourself, fatso.  I'd love to see his face.  That motherfucker. 
[01:19:30]  Dude.  Dude.  Yeah, you'll be fly fishing by yourself just looking over your shoulder going, oh, I think  he's going to show up any minute now.  Dude.  Traffic must have been bad coming out of the city.  Oh, is that good?  A teeny mountain highway.  Want to take another break?  Yeah, why not?  I got to eat.  Motherfucker got to eat.  Yeah.  Well, I don't say that at home.  I know you don't.  I say something else and then I say got to eat.  I was cleaning it up for our Ed Sullivan appearance. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, I go, got to eat.  What was the big one?  The Doors.  Couldn't say high or higher.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't that high.  But the big, big one was The Stones.  Which one?  Let's spend some time together.  Oh, right.  Instead of let's spend the night together.  Right.  Which is...  Can't even say let's spend the night together.  No, because...  How fucking...  How weird was that shit?  I love how they had to make believe in the 60s that, you know, people weren't fucking  and sucking.  Eating, drinking. 
[01:20:30]  And prolapsing.  Fucking pink sucking.  Let's just...  It must have been weird to live during a time where you just go, let's not acknowledge  the obvious.  That people fuck.  Yeah, when you watched I Love Lucy, they're sleeping in separate beds while all of America  were, you know, fucking and sucking.  Fucking.  Yeah.  That had to be weird.  She got pregnant, so at some point, people had to imagine that Ricky crawled into that  little fucking skinny twin bed of Lucy's, or Lucy just, like, got up in the middle of 
[01:21:00]  the night and grabbed this big uncut Cuban hog.  Not only that.  Just started jacking it.  Not only that, they showed him wearing pretty much snowsuits to bed.  Oh, my God.  They wear, like, that little cap and fucking pajamas.  Yes.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  But then at one night, it had to happen.  Ricky just fucking grabbed it.  Brr.  Grabbed it home.  Grabbed a big, giant red pussy.  You know, it was just a giant bush. 
[01:21:30]  Red bush.  Red bush.  Big clown fucking bush.  Those bushes.  Clown hair bush.  Her big fucking red bush, right?  And then his coarse black Cuban hair just banging together like that.  Wow.  Thank you, Danny.  The Cuban Missile Crisis.  Yeah, that was like...  The Cuban Missile Crisis.  His unclipped missile.  Oh, there you go.  You think she looked like Bozo down there with the red hair?  And then maybe the clit was bright red?  She had that weird red hair, too, Lucy. 
[01:22:00]  So she probably did.  Real, like, pink lips and everything.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And then Ricky just with the unclipped black hair going from his shaft to his head.  I can't even see his balls.  Oh, here we go.  Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  Oh.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I thought it was a pedophile song.  I thought it was Kitty Mountain Highway.  Oh, Kitty Mountain Highway.  Oh, that's different.  All right.  What are we going to do with this bit? 
[01:22:30]  Are we going to have people do Kitty Mountain Highway and then maybe...  Then they can do Teddy Mountain Highway and Kitty Mountain Highway and what was the one you  had over there?  Well, it was Kenny Mountain Highway.  Oh, and Kenny Mountain Highway.  This thing might have legs.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry?  Oh.  Larry King?  Larry?  Hello?  Hey, Larry.  Yeah.  Want to find out if the runners' period panties were boxes or braids? 
[01:23:00]  Period?  Period panties!  Thank you, Larry.  Let me go to Jeff in Georgia.  Jeff?  What's up, boys?  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, Opie.  You've been listening a long time.  Never really thought you were funny until today.  Jesus.  You are absolutely killing.  Off the hizzok.  Well, let me tell you something, because there's a lot of confusion about what I contribute  to this show.  My contract actually says I have to be funny once a month.  That's it, yeah. 
[01:23:30]  A little known fact.  So you're living right up to it, Dave.  You got such a good deal.  Thanks, Jeff.  I appreciate it.  Let's say hi to Senator Kennedy.  Whoa.  Wait a minute.  Gentlemen, good morning.  Good morning, Ted.  How's the afterlife?  I have it on good authority that if she doesn't have enough peanut to fuck you, it's not gay  if you fuck her.  Oh.  All right.  Not enough schlong to fuck you, then you could fuck it without being gay.  All right.  That is correct. 
[01:24:00]  I have that from the highest authority.  How's your head?  It's not bad.  It's healing up slowly.  You know, heaven has a chance of doing those kinds of things.  Okay.  Yeah, probably the headache has finally gone away.  Maybe you could take this thing for a ride for us, Teddy.  Which thing was that?  All right.  He doesn't even know what he's talking about.  The South African sprinter.  Yeah.  Take it for a little drive.  Dan in Ohio.  Dan.  Hey, this is, I'm sorry.  Wow. 
[01:24:30]  Way to end the show.  Holy shit.  I'm blowing.  Hey, Lucy was a blonde, actually.  She probably had a blonde book.  She was a blonde?  Yeah, I think they-  She dyed it that clown color.  Ew, that's a horrid color to dye your hair.  For what reason?  All right.  Got me.  Yeah, I don't know.  To be Lucy.  It was funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, they always made jokes about, you know, her dyeing her hair on the show, I guess.  She looked like a-  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, it looks blonde, but it looks like bleach blonde. 
[01:25:00]  She was probably mousy brown.  Let's-  Oh, damn it.  We lost a good one.  But we have Larry King checking in.  Larry.  Thank God.  Hello, boys.  Hi, Larry.  Governor Patterson, how do you know when to quit wiping?  Or does Kenny kill you?  Thank God it's in character.  You got to use your sense of smell when you're wiping and you're blind.  You got to take a sniff.  That's Lucille Ball right there.  Yeah, but that looks like she could have just bleached out her hair, right? 
[01:25:30]  Uh, Larry.  Larry?  Larry.  Boys?  Hi, Larry.  Hi, Larry.  Jesus.  I have a question for you.  Yeah.  Was Teddy Roosevelt the inspiration for your hit song, Teddy Mountain Highway?  Omaha, Nebraska.  Go ahead with your question.  Thank you, Larry.  Larry's the shit.  You think that all these Larrys out there are like, oh, my Larry's the best.  Fuck.  I had such a good Larry today. 
[01:26:00]  The guy before me, he sucked.  His Larry sucked.  I had the voice, the material.  I rule.  Teddy Mountain Highway.  All right.  We'll accept your songs.  I know there's a lot of bands trying to get some exposure, so there's a way.  Always.  There's a way.  Come up with a little song and we'll play the better ones.  I'll tell you a story about one little band that tried with a little OJ song parody.  You know how that ended.  Enough said.  Enough said.  Do you watch?  You don't watch America's Got Talent, do you?  No.  This is a quickie before break, because I know we've got listeners that are watching.  There is a singer on there that did a version of Careless Whisper. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  The Wham song.  Oh, right.  I remember that.  And remember, we brought to everyone's attention that what band does the remake, Travis?  Of what song?  Of Careless Whisper.  Oh, Sonic Youth.  Sonic Youth.  No.  Was it?  Careless from what soundtrack was that?  No.  Wow.  Oh.  Travis hasn't been listening lately.  No, I have.  Travis, what's going on with you?  Pay attention to the show.  What are you doing?  What are you texting pictures of the child or the dog? 
[01:27:00]  What are you doing?  First of all, my child and my dog are really adorable, so why wouldn't you?  But Careless Whisper was saliva, I think.  No.  Seether.  Seether.  Yeah, give me a taste of that.  Ah.  Hang on.  Thank you, Scott S. in Quakertown.  He had it on his feet.  Oh, he did.  So, I'm watching this America's Got Talent, and there's this young singer.  He kind of sounds like Chris Daughtry light.  Gotcha.  And it's time to see if he's going to make it to the finals, and his performance was Careless 
[01:27:30]  Whisperer.  You got the Seether version?  To the hook.  It's a wham song, obviously.  A very wimpy wham song.  Yeah.  And Seether made it into a rock song.  Rocked it up.  Maybe the boys down the hall could find the America's Got Talent version.  And what the judges said.  Actually, you know what?  That's what we'll do.  After the break, I'll explain my dumb point.  I'd love to know what the... 
[01:28:00]  Why did somebody do it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the judges...  I'll get into it a little bit after the break.  But let's play this to the hook, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor  As the music dies  Something in your eyes  Calls to mind a silver screen 
[01:28:30]  And all this sad goodbye  I'm never gonna dance again  Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm  Though it's easy to pretend  I know you're not a fool  I should've known better than to cheat a friend  And waste the chance that I've been given  So I'm never gonna dance again  The way I dance with you 
[01:29:00]  I noticed the FUs were a bit crispy right there  A little crispy  Talking about Michael Jackson and Tippi Tom dying  Oh boy  Fuck you to the ground crews in Lake Hurts, New Jersey  Mr. Hindenburg  Alright, we get it  It's old  They sounded a bit old there  What, we gotta re-promote the FU line, I'm thinking?  Apparently so  People have forgotten  The FU line is a great opportunity for you guys to, you know, rant and rave 
[01:29:30]  Vent  Vent  Yeah  We love the FU line  And usually we don't have to really promote it too much  But maybe we have to re-promote it  What's the number for the FU line if people want to leave their FUs?  I have no idea  Let's see  Ah, ha, ha, ha  Got Danny in the middle of chewing  Mouthful of chewing  That's the best  When you're eating  It's 866-FU-LINE-1  866  The letter is FU 
[01:30:00]  Line  The number one  We didn't have enough FUs to make a fresh promo  So you got an opportunity here  Call that number immediately  And then do your FUs  And you'll be on the radio next week  Or early  Yeah, early next week, I guess  Yeah, okay  I'm in a Twitter battle  You are  I always thought the  I thought the  Like, internet battles were done  When Twitter came up  Because it's like  Hey, it's not like websites  Websites were pretty much  You're kind of at the mercy of the website 
[01:30:30]  You know  Right  Even if you run it and stuff  You're kind of at the mercy of it  You know, comments get put on  They say people bitch at you  Yell at you  You can't make everyone happy  Kind of a thing  Twitter's different  Because it's like  Alright  Well, Twitter's there  If you don't like somebody  You block them  You don't like what they're saying  You block them  You don't have to read their shit  Or anything  But  There's some guy  Who is  I have to just say  Obsessed with me 
[01:31:00]  Really?  He's obsessed with  And I never say shit like this  I never really say shit like this  Obsessed with  Obsessed  Obsessed with  Like me and my life, I guess  And  Oh, you know who you're talking about that guy?  Yeah, Danny knows who I'm talking about  He apparently got very upset with me  He seems to be a fan of the show  And  That's what always confuses me  These people that say they're fans of the show  Say they're fans  And fan sites that you read them  And 
[01:31:30]  Really?  You're fans of the show?  Really?  He used to be  If you remember  On Whackbag or something  He was the cunning linguist  And  Now on  On  Fucking Twitter  He's  Talesin  Tale is T-A-L-E  S-I-N  If you want to have fun  That's not his real name  So I don't give a shit  But  Yeah  He is such  A dick bag  Such  A dick  He's blaming me 
[01:32:00]  And making threats  By the way  To other people  People that I know  He's threatening to  Reveal  Some secret  And  That's going to end up  With me  In trouble  Or in court  Or something  There was some inane babble  Going on  Where meanwhile  I am  This point in my life  I don't have  Any secrets  There is nothing that  Could be said on the air  That I  Is like  Oh my god  I gotta keep that 
[01:32:30]  Under wraps  I have no  It's such freedom  I have no skeletons  I've put  Everything out on the air  At this point in my life  Your life is an open book  It is really  The proverbial  Open book  A lot of times  I'm like  X-Nay  That one could hurt you  Everything's  Laid out there  You know  And I kind of  Took that  From Jimmy  Like Jimmy  Just fucking  Throws anything  Out on the air  And  It's pretty open  And it gives him  Like this freedom  You know  And after a while 
[01:33:00]  You just get this freedom  You don't have to worry  About anything  And if someone  Just wants to  Personally attack  Me or what I do  On this show  Then I  Like who gives a shit  About that  It's like  Alright  You don't like the show  You don't like me  Or what I'm doing  Fuck you  But this guy  Is so obsessed  With the fact  That I  Of the type of girl  I find attractive  First of all  Younger girls  Usually they are  A bit younger than me  Right  Just a tad  And

So that's my little Twitter war that was going on.  And if you go to my Twitter page, OP Radio, I got some great sunsets.  I got some great sunsets up there, yeah.  Yeah.  Just terrific pictures.  They're good. 
[01:41:30]  What did she write?  Here, go down.  No, I mean up.  I'm sorry.  Up to the top of the page.  She starts this whole thing way to the top.  There you go.  By going, the cunning linguist, the most bitter man in the world, enjoy.  Then she goes, he's a predator.  He really is.  I'm really putting myself out there for scrutiny by showing things I said, which is the girl.  She traded back and forth dialogue with this guy, so she didn't edit out her dialogue.  She goes, but I don't really care at this point.  I'm kicking myself in the ass for uninstalling Dead Aim because otherwise I would have more logs. 
[01:42:00]  Unfortunately, this is all I have.  Good stuff, though.  And, like, the first thing is something.  She goes, I wonder what I should eat here shortly.  He goes, I have an idea, dot, dot, dot.  Ha ha!  Your cock, right?  And she just made, like, an O face.  Like, oh.  And then he's just...  And go to the bottom of the page.  All the way down.  Here's his itinerary that he mailed to her. 
[01:42:30]  From this guy to this girl.  Arrives wherever this girl was.  Rents a car.  Travels to Newark with the girl in the car and blah, blah, blah.  Goes to the city.  Goes back to the city.  And then he writes, go down further.  Sex.  Debbie.  Like, he expected to have sex with her.  And then he goes, drugs.  David.  Because he accused her of using...  Stealing his prescription drugs that he used for his dental. 
[01:43:00]  He had for his dental operation that he had.  So he accused her of stealing drugs.  Stealing an iPod.  Not paying him for driving her to New York.  Which she says she never agreed to anyway.  The hotel room.  Which was supposed to be split.  And apparently she brought this other guy into the hotel room.  This idiot is sleeping on one of these twin beds or something.  She's on another bed.  Making out with another guy.  It pissed him off so bad.  He's like, get out.  Get out. 
[01:43:30]  Ah, you didn't get lucky.  And you got all pissed off.  She was 20 years old, wasn't she?  20.  Right now he's following and doing a...  You know how on Friday you do follow Friday kind of thing?  He sent a follow Friday a couple of weeks back about...  And it was a 17-year-old girl.  That just like...  He's chasing these girls.  And like I said, whatever.  Hey, whatever you like.  But he's chasing them around and giving me grief over my fucking lifestyle. 
[01:44:00]  Fuck you, motherfucker.  Fuck you.  He is so fucking obsessed with me.  Why does he have a problem with you?  What's the initial problem?  I don't know.  You know why?  That's what I need to know.  Because I got a cool job.  I got nice digs.  Girls that I like seem to enjoy my company.  I like having their company.  I don't get called a smelly fat fuck.  I don't have girls getting laid or making out with guys that I want to be with on the bed next to me. 
[01:44:30]  You know, just things like that.  So when I get on the air and talk about my life experiences and the fun I'm having and shit like that,  this guy gets very jealous and tells girls.  And another thing I do, I don't fucking lie to girls about how old I am on the internet.  Oh, that's a good one.  That's a hot one.  You won't see me lying.  People know my age.  So if some chick... 
[01:45:00]  You're lying.  When he came to the house to get this girl, she was like...  I instantly was like, oh, fuck.  He's not in his 20s.  So, you know, this guy's just a fuck stick.  And you guys have been battling the last few nights?  Well, I can't battle with him because he blocked me.  So I just...  But the thing is, people retweet what I say to him.  And apparently he's got a few people, you know, saying things.  But don't threaten me, motherfucker.  Don't threaten me or accuse me of anything. 
[01:45:30]  Because believe me, I know so many nice people with so much information on you.  You're not a very nice person from what I've been reading.  And he hasn't...  Not a very nice person.  He hasn't explained why he doesn't like you.  No, because he's kind of a lunatic.  He's kind of a fucking lunatic.  Other people have come forward now and said that, yeah, this guy has said this to me.  And he's telling me this shit.  Another girl apparently said something about that kitty girl. 
[01:46:00]  And he laid out a whole big thing of how I was involved with this and that.  Like, you know something?  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  You like it?  Hope you have fun.  Yeah, it's Talesin.  T-A-L-E-S-I-N.  All one word.  Go ahead.  Have fun.  Twitter him.  Give him some followers today.  He was giving me shit a few weeks back, actually.  Who was he giving you shit for?  Over a vacation.  I don't even remember at this point.  Yeah.  But I was just like...  I just retweeted...  You know, I responded to him. 
[01:46:30]  I was just like, dude, you follow me.  I'm not out there looking for you, bro.  If you don't like me, you have a problem with me, then don't fucking follow me, dude.  He follows everyone from the show.  His fucking picture for his Twitter, he's wearing a pest hat.  He follows everybody from the fucking show.  I mean, even like interns.  So he's obsessed.  He's an obsessed fanboy.  You're an obsessed little fucking fanboy.  Anyway, you'll never be at my house. 
[01:47:00]  So there you go.  Just wanted to get that settled.  Because a lot of people were asking me, what's the deal with this guy?  What the fuck?  So there it is.  It's spelt out.  Now everybody knows.  Have fun with him.  Here.  There it is.  There you go.  My little battles.  Just fighting battles all the time, aren't you?  Always.  Just in your head.  I'm always.  Danny does make a good point. 
[01:47:30]  This Twitter thing is very different than everything else that has come before.  And you follow people that you like.  And you get these people following you just to try to hate.  Yeah, just to fuck with you.  There's plenty of places to hate.  There's sites that supposedly are fan sites.  You can hate there all you want.  Plenty of hater sites.  But it's like, why would you follow someone if you actually didn't like them?  I don't really understand that.  There's a lot of people I don't like in this world.  Yeah.  I don't follow any of them on Twitter.  I don't post about them on message boards. 
[01:48:00]  And if you did, wouldn't you feel silly if you followed somebody on Twitter that you hated?  Wouldn't you just feel like such a douche?  I know.  I've blocked hundreds of haters.  Hundreds.  It's like, what do you?  Yeah.  I mean, what is wrong with your life that you don't like me and now you're just going  to follow me and hate on me on my Twitter page?  That don't make sense.  I've never had the self-esteem or ego to think that somebody was obsessed with me until this  guy.  This guy is so over the top that I can't not see it. 
[01:48:30]  He is obsessed with my lifestyle and cannot deal with the fact that he's married, divorced,  kids, and just cannot lead this type of lifestyle.  And it has him so upset that he has to just drill into me.  Ha ha.  Fuck off.  All right. 
[01:49:00]  Very good.  We're going to go to break with oral self-pleasuring by Anthony Comeo.  Yes.  Oh, I mean, yeah.  You feel good getting that out of you?  Yeah, it's always good to, you know, get that shit out.  I got some pointers for you.  Get the poison out.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You need a whole organization like I have.  Yeah.  So people don't get away with their shit anymore.  It's nice. 
[01:49:30]  That's all I can say.  Oh, believe me.  I got, you know, I got people in the know.  They, well, I got so much information last night.  It was retarded.  Retarded the info I got.  Oh.  Instead of spending money on your electric bill?  Yeah.  Well, well, well.  There's other ways to spend that money, my friend.  What's adult abusive behavior?  I don't know what that is.  What?  He's...  I don't know.  He accused you of that?  No, no, no.  It's something that might be on some kind of a court order or something. 
[01:50:00]  I don't even know what that is.  Is it the next thing we're talking about?  No, no.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  I just saw it down here in front of me.  I have no idea what it is.  Let's go to break with this.  All right.  And Jim Jeffries is going to join the program.  And Otto will be in studio today.  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  It will be good to see Otto.  But first this.  We welcome Jim Jeffries back to the program. 
[01:50:30]  Playing Carolines all weekend long.  Ticket sales very good for tonight and tomorrow.  Very, very good.  For the early shows, I think, better than the late shows.  You know, I got the Philly crew coming up to see you.  They love you.  Excellent.  Big fans of comedy down there in Philly.  The gang I hang out with.  But they don't come up for everybody.  But they're like, Jim Jeffries, we're there.  Don't tell them I'm going to Philly in like a week.  Oh, really?  Yeah, don't tell them.  Oh, shit.  No, don't tell them.  Are you really?  Yeah, I was like, no, like, no, I think it is like next week or the week after I'm going 
[01:51:00]  to be in Philadelphia.  Helium?  Doing like a little theater.  I don't know.  Oh, you're doing a theater down there?  Yeah.  Oh, very cool.  Very nice.  Yeah, but Carolines, tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday, 212-757-4100.  Tickets are doing very well.  So if you're thinking about it, you should call soon and get that done, okay?  Yes.  Get your reservations for Jim Jeffries.  Absolutely.  Jim walked in.  I'm like, hey, what do you want to talk about?  He's like, well, you guys kind of did the 9-11 thing.  But then he went off on how weird we are in America because we say 9-11. 
[01:51:30]  9-11 instead of 11-9.  What's up with the 11-9?  That's stupid.  Everywhere else in the world, we put the day first and then the month and then the year.  It's just a natural progression.  Why wouldn't you do it that way?  Why would you put the fucking month first?  It's very confusing.  And how do you do business with other countries doing that?  Because we're the greatest country in the world.  Because we do everything and everyone follows suit.  We did acknowledge the rest of the world in the late 70s and we said, all right, we're  going to do the metric system.  The rest of the world does the metric system. 
[01:52:00]  Then we said, fuck you.  I remember the pressure in school going, no, you got to, we're going to be doing this  a different way.  You got to learn this shit.  What, centimeters and stuff.  And then who was, who decided, fuck that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was it the president or somebody said, you know what, fuck that?  I think Reagan finally was like, yes, fuck you.  Because wasn't it a time thing?  They said, well, in the year, blah, which was a couple of years down the road.  Everything's going to be metric.  Kind of like, yeah.  And they started putting like a metric and standard measurement on there.  The metric system is better though. 
[01:52:30]  Which they still kind of do, 0.5 liters.  It is until you start talking about your weight and it's stones or something.  Yeah, but like when you're doing centimeters to inches, that's a finer measurement.  So, you know, it's more exact.  And also a meter, you have the 100 meter race, don't you?  Yeah.  Don't fuck around with how many yards is that?  Like 440 yard race.  That's retarded.  Why would anyone want to run the 440?  Yeah.  Run the 440?  The 440 is one lap. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  But he's talking about the sprint, which I think we said it was a 100-yard dash or something.  But I hear a 100-yard dash.  It's not a 100-yard.  You can't have a 100-yard dash in a 100-meter race.  The Olympics is 100.  Well, it's metric.  Because they're different measurements.  Why?  It's metric in the Olympics.  I did it right the first time.  Yeah, that does improve your time if you take it down to yards.  You go, I'm sure at the 100 meters, but I'm fucking fast at the 100 yards.  So if it was so good, why then would we just put the month first and then the day second? 
[01:53:30]  See, the thing is, when you go into the post office and you ask someone, you go, what's  the date?  What are you waiting to hear?  Are you waiting to hear the month or the day?  You're waiting to hear the day.  Right.  So if someone says, I don't know, what's the month at the moment?  Like the 8th or 9th or something?  What are you, 9th?  Are we in the 9th?  Actually, I don't know.  That's just ruined my argument.  So you need to know it's so fast that you can't look over that first number and just  see what the second number is.  I just think it's...  And it's also...  I need to know the day.  No, you're getting to the month first.  I think it's a little bit convenient that it's 9-11.  Like it's your 9-1-1 phone number. 
[01:54:00]  If your calendar went the same as everyone else's, then it's 11-9 and it's not creepy  in the slightest.  That's true.  Well, I...  So I think the terrorists probably started this up.  Many, many years ago, just, you know, in preparation.  Because they're always preparing the terrorists.  They're always putting effort in.  Yeah.  You can say what you want about them, but they're, you know, whoa, that girl on the  raincoat's cute, isn't she, in the middle?  Well, yeah, but we're not, you know, that's a pretty serious thing down there, Jim.  You shouldn't be looking at the girls and figuring out which one you want to bang. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, the thing is, the girls in the choir...  They're singing a very somber song right now.  A little respect for our country, okay?  And also, you've got to look at them.  When 9-11 happened, they were like four.  True.  True.  They're not that upset about it.  They're really young.  They don't even remember it.  Not like me.  I had to live through it.  Oh, I know.  They didn't even know.  They have no clue.  I remember when 9-11 happened, this is what happened to me.  I was...  I'd never been out of Australia, right?  And I was packing my suitcase to go off on my adventure to Britain.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  That was...  I was living in my parents' house, and I was like, oh, I'm going to go on a big  plane and fly to Britain with my bag full of dreams.  Right?  And then I'm packing my bag, watching the television, then, boom!  Oh, shit.  And I'm like, oh, the airport's going to be shit tomorrow.  Oh, man.  They still flew planes out of Australia?  Yeah.  Oh, they didn't care.  Yeah.  We stopped all air traffic here.  They stopped it here, and they did it.  They did an environmental check, and they said that it was the lowest level of pollution  ever on record in America, since they've been taking records. 
[01:55:30]  Is that true?  Don't make me go to Snopes.  No, because there was no...  Because there was no airplanes.  Because airplanes was big.  Yeah, no...  And so, you know, you can tell what you want about terrorism, but it's good for the environment.  I don't know about over Manhattan, though.  It was kind of...  Yeah, no, the air wasn't great.  The air wasn't really good over lower Manhattan, I'll tell you that much.  It smelled like death and plastic burning.  Yeah, it was really horrible.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun for us, Jim.  I'm not bagging it.  I'm just saying it.  I'm not being nice.  I'm not being disrespectful.  You're bagging the date?  The fucking way we say it?  It should be 11-9. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, let's rework the date.  I haven't come in until I'm glad it happened or anything like that.  All I've said is we've reworked the date.  I hope he's getting a bit serious on this one.  You're working the date.  You're looking at girls who want to bang at Ground Zero today.  When are they going to start building another building there?  Exactly.  Don't get us started.  Yeah, that's what we were talking about.  It's like, what the fuck?  People are going back into a ditch for another fucking year, eight years later.  They still haven't built anything, though.  There seems to be trucks down there doing this.  Because they're getting all their materials from Australia, and we're waiting for them  to be shipped over. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  One piece at a time.  One piece at a time.  Let's go to Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy.  Dean.  Hey, guys.  For a short period of time, they converted Route 17 upstate to metric only.  It was like 86 KPH.  So, of course, my car doesn't have KPH.  So, I got pulled over to an 85 and a 55.  I bought the ticket and won.  Yeah, because you're like, all I saw is fucking 86.  Yeah.  Don't give me shit.  That's exactly it.  Yeah.  Oh, that must have been a nice day that you beat that ticket.  Yeah, that's a weird one.  Have a good day, guys.  All right.  Because in Britain, they still use miles and all that type of stuff. 
[01:57:00]  Britain uses a bit of everything.  Miles per hour?  Yeah.  Well, because they want to be like us.  But they're on the other side of the fucking road.  Yeah.  What's that about?  Australia's on the other side of the road as well.  Yeah.  Do you hear what happened in Samoa?  Explain that.  Explain it.  Yeah.  Explain why you're driving on the wrong side of the fucking road.  England's an older country than you, and they had the other side of the road before  you did.  Yeah, but it doesn't make sense.  But you didn't have cars before we did?  No, but they just had horses and carriages.  Oh.  But I don't understand.  Oh, but the second you get a car, you got to go, all right, we got to switch. 
[01:57:30]  I don't know why.  Yeah, I don't know.  It must have been a greeting thing.  And America thinks they invented the car.  They didn't invent the car.  No.  Carl's Benz.  Yeah, invented the...  Mass-produced car.  Yeah, mass-production.  No, we invented and discovered everything.  The internal combustion engine was a black man.  That was Carl's Benz.  The airplane, two black men.  In Stuttgart.  I went to the museum.  It's good.  Two black men invented the airplane.  It is a good museum, man.  In Stuttgart.  If you go to Stuttgart, check out the Mercedes museum. 
[01:58:00]  It's fucking awesome.  A Stuttgart.  They have this machine that you put around your neck, and you point at the different  cars, and there's two buttons.  There's like, you're retarded, you're intelligent, right?  And the intelligent one will go, the combustion engine had this many things, an engine size  of whatever, and then a boot space of cubic inches and all that sort of stuff, right?  And then you've hit the retard button and go, this is a red car.  It's fast.  Because you start off with all the intelligent stuff, like, oh, this is cool. 
[01:58:30]  By the end, you're on retard button everywhere you go.  Yeah.  In Samoa, apparently, they had to switch the sides of the road and the car.  Is that because they're such fat bastards?  Yeah.  They're real fat.  You know what?  They had to switch the sides.  You should never do that.  If you're driving on the left side of the road, you just got to keep it.  You know what, though?  No, the secret, it's very easy.  The secret is.  But it's stupid to switch it because that's going to just cause havoc.  When you're driving on the wrong side of the road, because the car seat's different as 
[01:59:00]  well, you're always sitting in the middle of the road.  You don't think left and right.  Because otherwise that will confuse you.  You're always sitting in the middle of the road.  But that doesn't make sense either.  Why would you put yourself in the middle of the road?  But you're in the middle.  But we're in the middle of the road, too.  No, I know.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense in America either.  It is stupid.  You should be on the other side of the road.  You should be as far away from the oncoming car as possible.  Isn't it the death seat?  It's not the death seat.  If you see those cars zooming by, you're going 60, 70 miles an hour.  Well, then you turn and make sure it hits the passenger compartment. 
[01:59:30]  I don't know.  It's just one of those things.  But they had to actually make a, they gave everybody two extra days off.  To try to figure it out?  Yeah.  So there wouldn't be all this rush hour traffic and everything like that.  And put like extra cops out there.  But how do you switch, though?  Imagine if all of a sudden, hey, we're switching.  All the signs that would have to be turned around and the infrastructure.  No, but it's the changing of cars.  Buying the different cars.  Actually, switching the road is pretty easy. 
[02:00:00]  You'd have to turn every fucking sign around.  Have you ever been to Samoa?  The signs we have?  I don't mean Samoa.  I mean, if you try to do it like here.  Samoa has like four signs, six cars.  It says, stop eating, you fat fuck.  Anthony, remind me.  We haven't done an April Fool's prank in a while.  Yeah.  They're going to be changing the sides of the road.  Oh.  It's perfect for us.  Oh, my God.  It's perfect for us.  So if someone does it, gets into an accident, we get fired and sued.  What happened?  What happened?  What?  They've changed their sides.  Oh, good gravy. 
[02:00:30]  Let me say hi to Eric in Pennsylvania.  Eric.  How's that, man?  Evening.  Hey.  Hey, as far as the driving on the other side of the road in England, it comes from medieval  times during jousting because the majority of the people were right-handed, so they were  able to hold on to the jousting stick very strong.  Get in, son.  Good point.  I was just going to make that point.  Thank you for saying it for me.  So you're still driving fucked up because of jousting?  That's great.  Hang on, guys.  Makes sense, though.  What?  We didn't joust here?  And that's why you sit in the middle because historically, in British cars, you'd still have your jousting 
[02:01:00]  stick out the window.  You make rights on left?  Or rights on left?  You make rights on red?  On the left hand.  You can make a left on red, right?  A left on red for you guys?  You can make a left on red, right?  We do right on red.  You make left on red?  No, in theory you could, but that law, no, you can only turn on a green light.  Why?  I agree.  I think you people have, you've got toilets that are better and the right hand on red is  good as well.  Although you can't do it in New York City. 
[02:01:30]  What about the building of...  You can't do it in your...  Why?  I go through red lights in New York City, though.  I completely disobey the law.  What about the building of the roadways?  Came a time, all right, we've got to build a lot of roads, and there was a lot of open  land, but we still insisted they had to be right next to each other.  How stupid was that?  Oh, the lanes?  Yeah.  We had an opportunity when we started building the roads to make sure that there weren't  really going to be any head-on collisions.  Yeah.  That is a good point.  And now to this day, when we build new highways and roads, we're still building them right 
[02:02:00]  next to each other.  No, it's because they know that people want to make illegal U-turns.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and they go, well, you're not meant to do it, but every now and again, everyone  gets five.  That just seems kind of dumb, no?  I'm going to just do this.  Let me say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  Good morning, buh-buh-buh, boys.  Good morning, Larry.  Wow.  And a question for Jim.  Yeah.  Yes, Larry.  In England, the three lefts make a right.  Three lefts make a right.  Joe in Philly. 
[02:02:30]  Joe?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  What's up, Joe?  Happy birthday, little girlfriend.  What I was told is, the way that it started is because when people were in carriages,  they would shake hands with their right hand, which is the closest way, versus having to  reach across yourself.  Punch it out.  Wait, is that it?  No, bring this on.  On the other side of the room?  Yeah, you know how when we wear a shirt, you know how your buttons are there?  Yes.  And on the other side, girls' buttons are the other side, right?  That's how you can tell the difference between a man and a woman's shirt.  Yes.  And the reason for that is because back in the day, men were too retarded to dress themselves. 
[02:03:00]  And so it made it easier for a woman to button it up.  For a woman to button it up?  Yeah.  Is that where that comes from?  That's pretty funny.  Come on.  I like where...  That is funny.  I like that we're finding out where all this crap comes from.  Hey, Anthony's brother's on the line here.  Joe Cumia.  What's Joe doing?  Hey, brother Joe, I got to tell you, you just saved me a phone call.  I was telling Anthony this morning, I'm sporting a U2 Joshua Tree t-shirt.  Get out of here.  That's classic, man. 
[02:03:30]  And Bloomingdale's at the Walt Whitman Mall.  In the back, they kind of have a rock and roll section.  They got a bunch of really cool U2 shirts.  And I figured, you know, for you, it would be great because you're doing the U2 thing.  Yeah, the 2U U2.  Nice.  I'm going to have to go there and wear a U2 shirt while I play and look like a tool.  Or you wear it before you go.  I don't know.  But I figured that would be some info you might want to do something with.  They got Rattlin' Hump shirts, Under a Blood Red Sky shirts. 
[02:04:00]  That's the best one, though.  They got Boy.  They're not on Lemon, do they?  The Joshua.  Hell fucking no.  How gay would you have to be to wear a Zoropa?  Zoropa.  I actually have something to say that pertains to the conversation you guys were just talking about.  But before that, do you do any songs from Zoropa?  Yeah, we do Stay.  What else do we do on Zoropa?  Just Stay.  We do...  Stay's all right.  We do a cover band.  We probably do the entire record. 
[02:04:30]  I was talking to Joe at the UFC fights down in Philly, and man, like Ant said, he's got  this thing, franchise.  I'm like, Joe, how could you be down here when 2U's got to be playing somewhere?  It's a weekend.  He's like, ah, I got...  All the replacement guys are doing it this weekend.  He doesn't even have to show up anymore.  It's amazing.  It's just...  That rules.  It's not...  We're on the road to Chicago.  Yeah.  Me and Mike, background, they're in the...  Are you going to Chicago?  All right.  Yeah.  We're about halfway through, about a quarter of the way through Pennsylvania right now. 
[02:05:00]  You're driving to Chicago?  Yeah, I have production with me.  We're bringing the whole PA, lights, everything.  It's at McFadden's, right over by Soldier Field.  And U2 is playing that tomorrow.  And tomorrow is Sunday.  So we're going to be doing the pre- and post-parties at McFadden's on State Street in Chicago.  Let me tell you something.  I got to help Joe with the 2U band.  We haven't talked about it in a while. 
[02:05:30]  I'm a big U2 fan.  I know.  Whatever.  But when I saw him at the Garden, Joe was playing the House of Blues.  And U2 put on an amazing show.  And then I went and saw Brother Joe.  And he put on an amazing show, playing a lot of the songs that U2 didn't do in concert.  It was perfect.  We do that a lot, man.  A lot of the stuff that Bono can't, he can't hit notes on anymore.  Our lead singer is totally capable.  I mean, he's got an amazing voice.  And it's just something that, yeah, U2 can do a lot of the songs that they used to do. 
[02:06:00]  Like, 2 Hearts Beat is one, just like that with Terribano's throat out.  So they either drop the key, like, you know, a full step, or they don't do a song.  I've got jokes like that.  No, 2U is all right.  And you've got two versions now, touring around?  Yeah, sometimes we do.  It's usually when I'm double-booked or when one of the members can't be at a gig, we'll send the subs out.  But it's a mix-and-match thing.  We're all capable. 
[02:06:30]  Everybody knows this stuff inside out.  So we've played in every possible combination.  And at times, we have two bands go out at the same time when it's necessary.  But we were coming through the Midtown this morning.  And, you know, because I have a trailer behind me, I get pulled over religiously.  But it was a funny thing.  I pulled up to the toll booth today, and it's 9-11, and no one stopped me.  No one.  Really?  Yeah.  So I pulled up to the toll booth, and I said, you know, I mean, I could have. 
[02:07:00]  I said to the cops at the booth, I said, no one stopped me going into the tunnel.  I could have a trailer full of fuel oil and fertilizer, and no one would, you know.  So no one stopped me to inspect.  Pull over, sir.  Pull over.  All right, please.  We got to.  Exactly.  Why would you say that?  Oh, my God.  That's like.  I was busting balls.  I was busting balls.  Yeah, but that's like saying, like, bomb at the airport.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  When you're at the airport, did you pack yourself?  I recognized the cop.  He recognized me.  He knows that I'm your brother.  Oh, OK.  Good.  Get me a trip. 
[02:07:30]  I've been in that tunnel a million times with that.  Yeah.  He says to me, let me see your license, just to be sure, I guess.  And he checks my license.  He's my last name.  He's Killia.  He goes, we pull your fucking brother over.  He was seeing that news chick.  I don't know.  We must have pulled him over four times, blowing the fucking stop sign over here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I used to come around that corner.  And he would come out with a fucking handful of PBA cards.  And when we get pulled over, we're magicians all of a sudden. 
[02:08:00]  Pick one.  Pick one.  Which one do you want?  That fucking stop sign is useless over there.  That's why I never stop.  It is.  It should be a yield sign over there, motherfuckers.  Yeah, I really do not.  I don't pay attention to much on the road either.  I drive so much.  I really don't give two fucks about what anybody's trying to do.  I'll just take the fucking pullover.  From here to there, I'm going to get there at any cost.  And that's that.  That's it. 
[02:08:30]  All right, then, Joe.  Have fun in Chicago.  Where are you playing over there again?  Yeah, we're playing up.  It's McFadden's.  It's on North State Parkway in the city of Chicago.  We're doing two shows, one at 6 and one at 11, before and after the U2 shows over at Soldier Field.  Cool, man.  It's going to be great, man.  We have our own production.  Like I said, the sound and the lights are going to be incredible.  At this place.  We're bringing our own.  And I'll definitely give you a call when I get back, man. 
[02:09:00]  Cool, man.  Have fun.  All right, kids.  Thanks.  Brother Joe, everyone.  Go see Joe.  If you're into U2.  So worth it.  You extend your U2 night with Brother Joe.  Anthony and...  Yes there, Jim.  Just a gate.  What happened?  Two different channels, but they're still giving us the same names.  It's the same exact...  Yeah, I get...  But then occasionally you don't get the same...  Oh, it's very creepy.  That's weird.  That is kind of creepy.  Maybe they're reading the names.  Are they reading the names?  They must be.  Yeah, that would be a hell of a coincidence.  Yeah, I was about to say.  You match up a couple of thousand names. 
[02:09:30]  Anthony in Minnesota.  Anthony.  Anthony in Sarasota, you mean.  Sarasota is different than Minnesota.  Sarasota checking in.  Or a rich redneck thing.  Hey there, I just wanted to call you about the...  Driving on the left-hand side of the road actually predates about a year old times considerably.  It was adopted by the Romans, and the reason why is it came from the chariots.  Basically, you cross-draw, your sword is mounted on your left side, you cross-draw with your right hand,  most people are right-hand, to defend your chariot as the opposer is coming. 
[02:10:00]  That leaves your left hand free to hold the reins to control the horse.  That's drawing the actual chariot.  That is a good point.  You know what I know this is leading to?  At some point, someone's going to call up and go, no, that's not right.  And it always ends up being a, because they wipe their ass with their bare hands.  It always turns into that, no matter what it is.  Driving, hand-shaking, how you put your shoes on.  It always ends up, it's because they wipe their ass with their bare hands.  That's why it's so annoying as it comes from the Middle East to the Arabs. 
[02:10:30]  That's always like, yeah, the Arabs have been doing it, and they wipe with their hands.  It's going to go back to cavemen.  Yeah, that's it.  It goes back to cavemen and how they clobber each other with big rocks.  We got dinosaurs used to walk past you.  Oh, God damn.  All right, Anthony, thank you.  Let's go to Phil.  Phil?  That's pretty convincing, though, isn't it?  Chariots.  Yeah, wouldn't be.  Chariots, that's a good one.  That's a good one.  More than anything else we've heard.  What's up there, Phil?  Hello, Phil.  Phil, Phil Connors?  This left-handed traffic thing, at least in the mining industry, they do that because of the cab location. 
[02:11:00]  If you drift into each other and have a slight head-on, there's less chance of the driver getting seriously injured.  Interesting.  I think your cabs will be on opposite sides of the vehicle.  I don't know if that pertain to street traffic, but, you know, that's the way they do it down here in Texas anyway.  I hear you.  Thank you, sir.  John in Indiana.  John.  Hey there, Jan.  Hey, I just wanted to give you guys something to think about real quick.  The whole thing about the date first and month, I mean, if you've got a baby you have, don't you give it in pounds and ounces? 
[02:11:30]  You don't go from specific to general.  You go from general to specific.  Also, if you have money in your pocket, Anthony, you've got five bucks and a quarter in your pocket, what do you have?  I have five and a quarter.  Then why don't you start with the year?  Why don't you start with the year, then?  Because the year.  That's what I'm saying.  You should know that.  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on.  Come on.  That's why I'm talking all the way, Jeffries.  Jim is like, I'm going to start with the year, motherfucker. 
[02:12:00]  That's pretty general, isn't it?  He just proved Jim Jeffries' point, kind of.  Well, he had a great point until Jim Jeffries said, then why not start with the year?  Yeah, all right.  We can't wait because we're fucked up both ways.  Yeah, you put it in the middle.  It's either forward or backwards.  You have to start with the year and end with the fucking day.  He actually went after, after I proved him wrong, he just went, immigrant.  I didn't even catch that.  Oh, what an asshole.  That's great.  We should jump back in a break so we can get Otto in here. 
[02:12:30]  Otto's down the hall.  Busy day today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Before we do that, remember the like, um, like, um, guy?  Like, um, like, um, like, um, like, um.  A Buffalo Bills football player.  I hear you.  Was being asked a couple questions during a press conference, and this is him answering  two questions.  It leads to the, uh, the fine remix we got in front of us.  Right.  Like, um, like, um, I just, like, um, I was, like, um, I was, like, um, like, um, I was,  like, um, um, like, um, I was on just, like, um, like, um, like, um, I was, like, um, I 
[02:13:00]  was, like, um, like, um.  That's not real, isn't it?  Like, um, it's so, like.  For the most part, it's real.  It's not real.  There might be a couple edits in there, but in general, that is real, yes.  I hear too many, like, similarities.  Yes.  I don't know.  They got the same names going, but different pictures on some of the people, which is odd.  Oh, shoot.  See, they got a picture on Channel 5 for one girl, and then, uh, Channel 11 doesn't have  a picture.  One, yeah.  That's a better picture on the bottom.  It's like different relatives are sent.  I mean, that one's a black and white photo.  It was only 2001. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, come on.  Wow.  Same picture.  You have a problem with black-white photos now?  Jesus.  Oh, he doesn't care.  He doesn't even mention it.  I'm being mean now.  He's not even mean.  He's like, he's...  You don't care.  You're not from the States.  I have no fucking idea what the big event was in Australia.  Oh, that was 7-09 or something.  No, 7-7 was Britain.  7-7.  Oh, what was the big thing that happened in Australia that most Americans have no idea  about?  You're 9-11, let's say.  Our 9-11 didn't happen in Australia.  It happened in Bali, right? 
[02:14:00]  But it happened in...  Because Bali's frequented by the Australians.  That's where we go and spend our money.  You get a beer for like five cents, and then they give you money back with it.  Nice.  But they blew up a nightclub in Bali that was filled with Australians.  So we lost a couple of hundred or something.  But what about something on your home soil there?  Oh, nothing, nothing.  What's the biggest event?  I mean, we talk about Pearl Harbor in the United States, 9-11.  If you watch that movie Australia, we had as many, I don't know if it's as many, the end  of that movie Australia with Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman or whatever, we had Darwin 
[02:14:30]  where we had all of our boats, the Japanese came and blew up all that as well.  I would say Thunderdome.  Yeah, I think Thunderdome was a big one.  We had a thing as big as Pearl Harbor in comparison.  Really?  And no one knows about it.  And no one gives a shit.  They didn't even broadcast it in the media at the time that it happened.  They kept it all hushed, hushed.  What year was it?  Same year?  Same year.  It was like a week later or something.  A week later?  Yeah.  Poor bastards.  I'm not exact here, but it's in that movie. 
[02:15:00]  That was the big climax of the movie.  You watched that movie?  We've had other things like the genocide of the Aboriginal people.  We all do that.  We had that with the American Indians.  Who cares, right?  They'd argue that that was an event.  Up top on that one.  Got to clean out the riffraff, right?  Before you start your country.  Did you give them casinos?  No!  We did, see?  We're fucking decent.  We're way worse than you.  Yeah, yeah.  I think someone once called Australia South Africa, where the white man won. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, shit.  That's pretty bad.  Hold on.  Can I call a travel agent?  I have to book a flight to Australia.  It's funny you say that, because 400 years ago today, Henry Hudson discovered Manhattan.  And we're having a problem with people discovering places where people already live.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Henry Hudson came down the fucking river.  That's that whole thing that blows the Bible out of whole concept.  In the Bible, they still thought the earth was flat, and they thought the only country  was like some Arab country. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  That was it.  Wherever they were.  Right.  So, yeah.  Wherever they were, right?  That was it.  So, anything that wasn't found didn't exist.  But God made the world.  Yeah.  In his fucking book, he didn't want to mention.  No.  He didn't mention it.  Because the most asked question on a webpage called Ask God is, were there koalas on the  ark?  No, were there kangaroos on the ark?  It's what every kid asks. 
[02:16:30]  And the answer is, although there's no mention of kangaroos, of course there was, because  there's two of each animal.  Because there's kangaroos now.  But also because God did not know about his own creations until we, the humans, found them  and put them in print.  And put them in print, yeah.  So, God discovers the world, but the Bible doesn't talk about the other side of the world  at all.  The Bible doesn't know the rest of the world.  We just rot for eternity.  Yeah, that's all we do.  It took Jim Jeffries to figure it out for me.  The prophet Jeffries.  I never thought of that. 
[02:17:00]  They were just, it was like a local radio station.  It was like a local radio station.  I was just talking about their area.  Yeah, it's like, of course.  Everyone always does that go, how could Noah get fucking two of each animal on the ark?  He was in Afghanistan with a couple of yaks and four lizards.  Yeah, where are you going to get like?  I could get that in the back of my car.  An American eagle.  Yeah, exactly.  Where are you going to get that?  Well, I guess you didn't have to get that.  He didn't have tigers and shit.  All the animals on the ark were nothing.  He didn't talk about the Grand Canyon, nothing in the Bible.  Elephants.  No, nothing.  No fucking Grand Canyon, Yellowstone.  Rattlesnakes.  Nothing. 
[02:17:30]  No, there's no zebras.  What about the Caribbean?  Yeah, how's he going to get that?  You talking about the Caribbean?  Did you just say a zebra?  Zebra, yeah.  Motherfucker.  Love it.  Get out.  Love it.  No one says zebra.  No one says zebra on our show, ever.  Zebra.  Zebra.  Zebra.  Zebra.  Well.  How do you say ace?  Do you say ace?  You say fucking Debra.  That's how you say zebra.  Exactly.  You don't call her Debra.  You just proved your point.  I'm just saying what you were going to say. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, did you guys, Tom in Boston.  Oh, shit.  Well, let Tom ask Jim Jeffries.  Tom.  Good evening.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, fellas.  Jim, you might know, Australia rounded up all their Arabs after 9-11.  Isn't that true?  They went in and rooted them out of everywhere.  Yeah.  I don't think that's true.  That would have been nice.  No, I don't think that's true.  Oh.  All right, then.  Thanks.  That's all right.  I think that would still be seen as an illegal act. 
[02:18:30]  That might be seen as...  You can't go around with a stick going, get out of there.  Why?  It's Australia.  You can't...  You know something also?  You can do whatever you want down there.  You can't round up people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the worst thing that you could do to people is round them up.  You can't.  Because it's not...  You don't round people up to go to an amusement park.  Because we've never done that before.  You round them up.  Something bad happens after they're rounded up.  You can't...  You can't hold a grudge after that for many, many years.  Down to a mosque.  In some cases, over 100 years.  Is there any muzzies here? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  If there's any muzzies...  Muzzies!  Just come with me.  Nothing's going to happen.  We've just got...  We want to talk to you.  We just want to talk to you.  Let's go to break.  Yeah, you with the pretty eyes.  Over here.  We're going to continue with this, but I want to get Otto in because he's been waiting around  a little too long.  So, a quick break.  So, the like-em thing.  We're just playing the remix going into break here, okay?  Yes.  For everybody?  All right.  Oh, by the way, Jim Jeffries, Caroline's all weekend long.  Tickets going fast.  212-757-4100. 
[02:19:30]  We say...  Wait a minute.  I turned down all our monitors before.  Oh.  What's up, Otto?  I want to say hi to Otto from Otto and George in the studio.  Thank you.  Playing the Comedy Shop in Pinebrook, New Jersey tonight and tomorrow night.  JJComedy.com or call 866-552-6633.  Extension 1. 
[02:20:00]  Extension 1.  Yeah.  Is that what it says?  I guess.  Makes it a little difficult.  Go to OttoandGeorge.com for all of Otto's dates.  Thanks for having me on, man.  You guys have never said no to me.  I appreciate that.  No.  That's because we're scared of you, Otto.  I don't have a sense of entitlement.  No.  We're scared of you.  That's why.  You look like you could be a problem.  It's getting hot in here.  Isn't that your signal for what's going on?  It used to be.  Yeah, it used to be.  Master Poe, right?  Master Poe.  How is he doing?  We have a new signal.  I don't know.  Steve is gay. 
[02:20:30]  Oh.  Yeah, then he comes running in.  Whatever happened to Line of the Day?  You guys don't do that?  We just brought it back.  Just brought it back.  Literally two days ago.  Cool.  Anything we can do to shorten the actual live time of the program so we can get the fuck  out of here sooner.  I don't know how you guys do it.  I don't know how you do it every single day.  Line of the Day, it's not that hard.  I got into a sleep habit that is the worst one I've ever been in, and it's brand new.  Never done this before.  I go home about noon-ish.  I sleep. 
[02:21:00]  Last night, I woke up at 9 o'clock at night.  I slept from noon till 9 at night.  It's a good night's sleep.  I got up.  I got up.  Stayed up.  And fucking, you know, 4.30 in the morning, I get ready, and I came in.  So I haven't been asleep.  Since 9 o'clock of last night.  Oh, so this is like the evening.  That's very cool.  Yeah, so it's like, but I don't like it.  No.  Because I miss the whole day.  Like, now I don't want to do that when I get home because it's Friday.  I want to hang out.  I want the entire Friday. 
[02:21:30]  Well, that's where you blew it.  You should try to get back into some kind of normalcy for the weekend for yourself.  Yeah, what I got to do is start.  Because now you're going to have to sleep till at least, what, 4 or 5?  No, start drinking immediately when I get home.  Holy shit.  That'll work.  Because then it'll reset the clock.  Danny knows.  That's fucked up.  I don't know how you guys do that.  I'll be having some Guinness.  Uh-huh.  And then I'll reset the clock.  Well, I'll go home and sleep and then do a show and then sleep a little bit.  Then, you know.  Yeah, I can't.  Have an afternoon nap.  I'll just go on stage just sleepy.  Sleepy. 
[02:22:00]  For a while, though, I was going home noon, sleep until like 3 or 4.  And then I'd stay up until like maybe midnight or 1 in the morning.  Go to sleep and catch like a few hours.  But it just kept turning a little more and more.  Each time I'd sleep later and stay up later until just yesterday, I think was the first time.  I went like, I didn't even fucking go to sleep.  Do you still keep those hours in the weekend?  No, the weekend really gets fucked because I don't, I sleep, I don't get up for work.  So I would never get up early on a weekend. 
[02:22:30]  You don't sleep on weekends.  I fucking sleep.  You pass out on weekends.  Doesn't your body clock still make you go to sleep in the middle of the day and you still wake up early because that's what you're used to?  I'm up by 7 every fucking Saturday and Sunday morning and that's sleeping in.  That's sleeping in.  I am noon.  I'll wake up at noon and then I'll lay in bed and watch fucking crime shows like fucking First 48 and Forensic Files until 3 in the afternoon.  I wake up early if I get really drunk the night before.  Like the hangover wakes me up.  I hate that too.  It's like, could I please sleep?  I've been laying in bed with a headache just going, please go back to sleep. 
[02:23:00]  Please go back to sleep.  You can't force yourself to sleep.  It doesn't work.  It sucks with a hangover.  Your head's pounding because sleeping through a hangover is great.  Yeah.  You're like, because if you're able to wake up early in the morning and go, oh my God, I feel like shit and you fall asleep, you wake up like hours later and go, all right, I'm ready for a beer.  That's fucked up because I'm with Jim Jeffries, man.  Hangovers wake me right the fuck up.  But I don't want to wake up.  It does that to me too.  No, I can't sleep though.  And Otto's right too.  You can't talk yourself into sleep because subconsciously it fucks everything up and puts you in some kind of panic state. 
[02:23:30]  So you know you're staring at the ceiling even though you're dead tired.  Otto, what do you think of the 9-11?  We're up to eight years.  Any thoughts today?  I just remember having to work that weekend and how the audience just seemed to, they needed some relief terribly and they felt like, yeah, I felt like I was really like doing something good for people.  You could do some Arab jokes back then.  So in shock back then.  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  I was telling Anthony.  I wanted to grab a rifle.  I know, right?  It just pissed you off.  Yeah, very.  I can't watch that because right now there's on one of the screens in here is a TV station playing the real time.  Yeah, it's real time like it's happening right now.  I don't think it is real time because I've seen the explosion twice.  But it's 9.21 a.m.  Yeah, no, it's in real time.  That's real time.  There were two planes.  And it's so annoying to watch.  Who doesn't give a shit about our country.  No, I do give a shit.  I just think if you watch this in real time, you can bake a cake and then like, all right, when the building falls, then it'll be ready. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, my God.  You know what?  You know what?  Like, you gotta have a laugh, really.  I'm not being nasty.  I'm just fucking with you.  I know you give a shit.  Now we can see where the government agents were in there, you know, and setting the explosives.  Thermite paint.  Thermite paint.  Oh, I think I see someone in the lower right-hand hole.  And that, oh, that's got to be awful.  Oh, is that stuff that lives up?  Thermite paint.  Thermite paint. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What Jesse Ventura is talking about.  You know, he was a governor.  That's terrific.  And he thinks.  And he thinks the government brought down the building.  We're painting the walls with thermite paint.  It was a controlled detonation.  Yeah, that implosion bullshit.  Yeah, when you watch them.  Because I've watched a lot of those shows on Discovery Channel and shit like that.  And you see them go into these buildings and demolish them.  And they have to rip the fucking building apart first.  It's not like you just go in there with dynamite like fucking the coyote.  Yeah, you gotta drill the beams out.  You gotta cut the fucking metal I-beams.  And then put shape charges.  Oh, for a perfect implosion? 
[02:25:30]  That slice through.  Yeah.  And they were like, well, you know, there were people working on the security system.  No, they're not running fucking concrete drills and running primer cord through the hallways.  So what is that theory?  Is that there were no planes at all?  Or that what?  They can never explain what happened with the planes.  There's a lot of theories.  What's the theory, though?  Why would it be a controlled explosion?  What happened to the planes?  Where'd they come from?  Dummies.  Yeah.  I hate those fucking idiots.  What about the fucking planes?  We saw the fucking planes hit the buildings.  Yeah.  What's that theory?  I was telling Anthony, you're a gatekeeper.  You're not a truther. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  We're truthers.  You're like a gatekeeper.  Shut up with your conspiracy talk, you fucking cunt.  Is that what people say, gatekeeper?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Just be another one of the gatekeepers.  Like we're keeping the secrets in and keeping you out.  I am the key marks.  They're the truthers.  Shut up.  It's not World of Warcraft, you dummy.  Go back in your basement and fuck your mother.  I was telling Anthony, eight years, the technology's gotten way better.  We all remember when the video hit of the first plane hit, and we're like, holy shit,  someone actually captured that on film. 
[02:26:30]  That's insane.  And the angle and the footage was horrendous.  And I'm like, now, and if this, God forbid, this happened again, you'd have a thousand  angles of the plane hitting views on iPhones.  Because we all have our fucking iPhones and Blackberries.  Everybody got the second one.  Dude, look, I twittered the plane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A Twitter.  Yeah, but.  Fucking A.  There would have been people on the plane with internet.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, twittering.  Yeah, twittering.  You end up like Eric, trying to capture every little horrific detail.  Exactly.  Oh, don't bring that up again, please.  I'm just saying.  Please don't bring that up again. 
[02:27:00]  Eric's the worst.  I got to tell Otto, when the plane hit the helicopter over the Hudson River, it's happened  kind of where E-Rock lives.  So he ran down to the shoreline or whatever, and he started taking pictures and tweeting  like crazy.  He was the guy to go to.  And his pictures were horrendous.  You couldn't see shit.  No.  But he was so excited that he was, you know, being a reporter that guy.  It's nice to have opportunities, isn't it?  Yeah.  The way he labeled his Twitters, too, his tweets. 
[02:27:30]  He said like, another body being pulled from the water.  So you'd look at that and go, holy fuck.  I gotta click on this.  Click on the link.  And it may as well have been like you're looking out a mile into the ocean and seeing  a little dot that was a boat.  And you can't see shit.  That's Otis Redding.  Yeah.  They're pulling another body from the water.  Are they, E-Rock?  God damn.  Jesus.  Nothing.  Man, what a shitty day to be reading names, huh? 
[02:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Rainy and really cold.  The type of rain that goes sideways.  Yeah.  That's what I was saying before.  You can say what you want about 2001, but the weather was nice.  It was a lovely day, wasn't it?  It was a lovely day.  Nice and clear.  Someone turned us on to something Rosanna Scato said about that particular day.  I want to play it.  Rosanna Scato, one of the newswomen.  Yeah.  Here in New York.  And I think she had Bloomberg on with her.  So I think you're going to hear Bloomberg's response to what she said.  Listen to this. 
[02:28:30]  We were talking earlier that 9-11, 2001 was the most spectacular day ever.  And since then, I can't remember a 9-11 that was, that even came halfway close to that  day.  Well, the weather.  Oops.  Maybe you shouldn't have put it that way.  What a fantastic day it was.  She didn't even mention the weather.  No.  She just went, what a great day it was.  What a spectacular day.  Like she was hoping for another tragedy to fall on 9-11.  That's what I got out of.  You know what I remember about 9-11? 
[02:29:00]  Not having to go to work.  Right.  Everyone had a day off.  What an amazing, spectacular, wonderful day it was.  Oh, the fucking weather.  Shit.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean.  We had some sunny, clear days on 9-11 since.  I know.  She's an idiot.  You know what was cool about it?  It's just, you remember that day because of what happened.  In Australia, it was like 10 o'clock at night, so it was just, it was like really good viewing  because, you know.  How'd that work?  I didn't have to wake up for it.  It was just off.  You guys were broadcasting when that happened?  Well, we did afternoons then, so they were like, get your asses in. 
[02:29:30]  We're like, well, they've closed the tunnels and the subway and the trains.  We don't, and they guys have a studio on Long Island, and we met Sean Hattie.  Did you try and do a funny shower?  Hell, fuck it.  Oh, no.  It was impossible.  We just, we pretty much had a TV on, and we were taking calls from people that were freaking  out, and we were like, holy shit, what's going on, you know.  This must have been back in the day, and what's the phrase that pays?  Yeah, yeah.  We never did the phrase that pays, motherfucker.  Open Anthony Rock.  That's right. 
[02:30:00]  The phrase that pays.  We did some hacky things, but we never did the phrase that pays.  Oh, my God.  We got a plane just hit the other building, and hey, remember, it's Budweiser night tomorrow.  We're going to be all day long.  No, no.  No, when we were broadcasting, buildings were still falling down.  I think number seven fell down while we were, remember that?  Was it?  Yeah, right.  We saw people running.  Right in the middle of us trying to be experts on Muslim terrorism.  Yeah.  We didn't have a lot of time.  We all became experts in one day.  On the day, were you already up to date on the whole? 
[02:30:30]  Hell fucking no.  I've been out to Iraq and Afghanistan and done gigs, and this is what soldiers have told  me.  They reckon that there's not a chance in hell that he's still alive.  Bin Laden, yeah?  Yeah.  They reckon they've bombed the hell out of those mountains all around.  They know where he would have been hiding.  Yeah.  And they reckon they've found no less than nine dialysis machines.  Yeah.  And he was on dialysis.  Now, how many...  Just leaves a trail of dialysis machines wherever he goes.  How many... 
[02:31:00]  He's got to be running out of dialysis machines.  Yeah.  And if you want to find him, find the company that sends the dialysis machines and just follow  that little bit of transport.  You know what, though?  He occasionally sends those tapes, though.  No, but...  Although he hasn't sent one since...  They never...  It's been a while.  The tapes are never...  They might already have the tape sitting there.  No, but sometimes he's referenced stuff that has happened recently.  What?  Can you speak Arabic or...?  No.  It might be a loose translation or something, so I don't know.  A loose translation there.  He always looks like Scotty Pippen. 
[02:31:30]  I don't fucking...  Don't you think he looks like Scotty Pippen with a beard?  I'm not from Australia, but I was able to find out what a zebra meant when you said it,  motherfucker.  That's pretty good, Scotty Pippen.  Scotty Pippen.  He's got the Chicago Bulls.  Oh, shit, he does.  Oh, damn, it's fucking Bin Laden.  We found him.  He's Scotty Pippen without the...  Look, I know retirement was tough on Scotty Pippen, but he didn't have to do all this.  That's that whole thing that the Arsenal Football Club, which is one of the big soccer teams 
[02:32:00]  of the Premier League, Arsenal, Bin Laden, I think he went to university or something,  he was a fan of Arsenal, and Arsenal said this.  They go, well, he's banned from the ground after 9-11.  Wow.  And it's like, don't ban him.  Give him a season pop.  See if he'll fucking show up.  Yeah, maybe he'll show up.  You know what I mean?  Ban him.  Yeah, wow, we're banning him.  Do a bobblehead night and see if he shows up for his bobblehead night.  I'll tell you what.  Did I call that?  Oh, no.  That's a good call.  He does fucking look like him.  Holy shit.  A little bit. 
[02:32:30]  A little bit.  It's outrageous.  A little bit.  Yeah.  And, you know, it doesn't give us peace of mind that he might be dead there, Jim Jeffries.  We need, like, proof.  I think a lot of people need proof.  That's just what the soldiers told me.  They think.  They think.  How close were you to the mountains in Afghanistan?  You went to Afghanistan?  I've been to Afghanistan a couple of times.  Yeah, I've been right.  Camp Bastion is where I normally do the gigs.  And I go right in there and.  Kick some ass?  They give me guns.  They let me play.  This is what happened to me, right?  They let you play. 
[02:33:00]  I've got.  If we go to YouTube, I can show you footage of me playing with plastic explosives in Afghanistan.  Right?  But they sometimes take it off.  What happened was they just let us play with guns and stuff like that.  And then I'm molding, right, this, like, plastic explosive.  And then I videotape it.  I'm like, yeah.  You know when you come back from the airport, they take the little swab of your laptop.  Oh, shit.  I've got a fucking video camera.  I've just left Afghanistan.  Yeah.  I'm at the airport.  Where did you come from?  Afghanistan.  Why is there fucking bomb dust all through all your shit? 
[02:33:30]  It's all kinds of C4 shit all over me.  Right?  And so I'm like, I'm sat in this room.  I was playing with it.  And then I've gone to him.  Oh, so they really grilled you, like, hard?  Yeah.  And then I said, play the video camera.  Play the video camera.  You'll see what I was doing.  You'll see that I was with soldiers.  The guy literally presses play like it's going to, like.  Oh, it's going to explode.  Like he's cutting the red wire.  Just pictures of me joking around.  If you put in Afghanistan, Jim Jefferies. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, that's what Danny put in.  Anything good?  It gets taken down every now and then.  Oh, they just don't want that out there.  Yeah, because we weren't meant to be playing with guns and shit.  They also let us play with the dogs, like, that would chase you in the outfits and all  that.  Oh, really?  You got in the big, puffy, padded outfits?  You can do that all day.  That's one of the funnest things you'll ever do.  Isn't that the best way to play with a dog?  Oh, you can punch the dog.  The dog can run at you.  You think, I can take this guy.  Punch it in the head.  You might be onto something with the Scottie Pippen thing.  Colorado Brandon writes, oh, Scottie been Pippen. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, sounds just like it.  Oh, we've got to get the rest of this Rosanna Scotto clip on, too.  Oh, right.  We were talking earlier that 9-11, 2001, was the most spectacular day ever.  And since then, I can't remember a 9-11 that was...  One where we didn't get attacked.  That even came halfway close to that day.  Well, the weather certainly is not, but there's also, in a more serious note, there has never  been a 9-11 since then like that.  3,000 lives, a wake-up call to America that we aren't as separate from the rest of the 
[02:35:00]  world as I think we thought we were, and that we have to continue to fight around the world  to keep our freedoms.  And we see our young men and women doing that and sadly dying doing it.  Well, Bloomberg kind of put her in her place there.  Shut her the fuck up, right?  Rosanna Scotto.  Listen here, bitch.  You sound like an idiot.  We got Otto from Otto and George in the studio playing Comedy Shop in Pinebrook, New Jersey  tonight and tomorrow.  With Reverend Bob Levy?  You know that guy.  Of course. 
[02:35:30]  He's starting to do our show a little bit.  A little bit.  He is?  Yeah, a little bit here and there.  Rich, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Rich.  I just want to say thanks to Otto and George.  I saw him down in Hampton Beach about a month ago, and since then I can't call black people  black people.  I've got to call them guilties.  Oh, my God.  Oh, thanks.  I think I remember that, dude.  Yeah, it was me and my wife over in the corner.  Right, okay.  How are you?  Me and my wife.  George is very racist.  Yeah.  George is very racist and intolerant. 
[02:36:00]  Before I ever did a gig in America, I did Montreal just for last, and me and Otto worked  together on the Nasty Show, and I have to say that Otto and George is one of my favorite  acts in the entire world.  I'm not just saying that to suck up.  Nothing makes me laugh more than that puppet, man.  Love Otto and George.  Thank you.  Really funny, man.  Comics are jaded.  They, you know, don't like anything.  It's true.  It's hard to make a comic.  They never like anything.  Yeah.  Bunch of insecure cunts.  Yeah.  I remember, I can't remember who it was at the time, but the heavyweight champion of 
[02:36:30]  the world, you know there's like 10 of them at any given stage, right?  Yeah, yeah, depending on what...  One of the heavyweight champions of the world was in the front row of the Nasty Show, and  George is just there going, what?  You got tattoos on there?  What are you using black on black for, you circus ape?  Holy shit.  Was he the heavyweight?  It was the heavyweight champion of the world, and the puppet was being racist towards him,  and I was like, are you fucking kidding me?  And in the end, the guy clapped, and then he was like, oh, right, the puppet got away with 
[02:37:00]  it.  Yeah, you get away with a lot of shit with that puppet.  Yeah, that's true.  Or a Larry King voice.  I got a mate in Britain who's a ventriloquist, and the guy came up to him after the gig and  goes, oi, you, you tell that puppet of yours to watch his fucking mouth.  Oi, oi.  Let's say hi to Richie in Arizona.  Richie.  Yeah.  Hey.  Listen, I've been in dialysis for 17 years, and there ain't no way this guy is dialyzing  in a cave.  It takes special equipment, special water treatment. 
[02:37:30]  This guy is not dialyzing in any cave.  They haven't got him.  There's no possible way in the world.  These aren't just cave holes.  They're actual concreted rooms that they're in.  They're not, when they say they find, there's a whole infrastructure through those mountains  that isn't, it's not what you think.  It's not like the Flintstones.  You ever watch Cities of the Underworld?  This has been done over the ages of just.  I've watched Cities of the Underworld.  It's pretty amazing where they make a whole community under a mountain. 
[02:38:00]  He's got enough money to have anything built.  Yeah.  He's a billionaire.  Yeah.  He needs to have a water supply, a reverse off-the-simosas system, a special filtration  system, and then all the equipment that goes on the machine.  There's special dialyzers, which is an artificial kidney.  Right.  There's no way this dude's doing, I mean, if he's doing all this, like Jim said, trace  that shit, because that dude could be found easy.  There's only about five companies in the world that make this shit.  Yeah.  And it'd be easy to find out who's supplying this shit to him. 
[02:38:30]  I'm going to say it right now.  Well, the dialysis people cause 9-11.  I'm putting it out there.  See?  You know something?  I'm putting it out there.  These companies that allegedly help people.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm not taking it back.  You can quote me.  If his kidneys would have failed, it never would have happened.  Fuckers.  Really.  Medical attention.  And what do you...  If he had that much fucking money, he would have got a kidney already. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, that's one thing.  Like, you know...  There's probably something in the Muslim family.  Right, probably.  I mean, you know, there's just waxing.  It's not a pork kidney.  Kidney isn't made of pork.  I'm not up on my religion.  Yeah, I think there's something in the Muslim religion you can't have a kidney.  Something about it.  I don't know.  Rishi's definitely on to something.  You don't think someone in his entourage was a perfect fit for fucking giving up a kidney  for Osama bin Laden?  Get his brother Pippin to do it.  Pippin's got two kidneys.  Keep whacking people until they've thrown a kidney at work.  One of the guys that's going to be a suicide bomber the next day. 
[02:39:30]  You go, excuse me, dude.  Can I have a kidney?  Yeah, right.  Shit.  That's what I always found weird about 9-11 was that some of them were sitting in first  class.  No, some of them were sitting in economy.  Why wouldn't all of them be in first class?  Yeah, you're thinking...  What are you saving your money for?  Enjoy a movie.  Have a nice meal.  What are you fucking around for?  If you get a window seat, you can't even get up to hijack.  They wanted to take over the entire plane and make sure people were controlled in the  back and in the middle and in the front. 
[02:40:00]  They had it all figured out there.  My God, man.  This Jim Jefferies doesn't appreciate the...  I don't know where it's figured out against the terror.  Where do you plug in a fucking dialysis machine in a mountain?  Same place you charge your phone.  Where?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  What is it, run off an old Ford?  No, there's generators and stuff.  Oh, generators.  Yeah, he's probably got James Bond type of caves with everything you need.  You think that?  Like the Batcave or something like that? 
[02:40:30]  It's a petrol run dialysis machine.  And you can say what you want about the Arabs and they've got fuck loads of petrol.  It shows you dump oil in there.  Filtering your kidneys with an internal combustion engine.  If they could give Australia electricity, they could get electricity in a cave.  That's true.  I don't know how the fuck you guys got electricity being the only thing around.  That's weird to me.  Water generated stuff.  Yeah.  How did you get electricity?  We're connected to the land masses.  You invented it.  We were able to figure it all out. 
[02:41:00]  Hey, fucking Menlo Park, my friend.  Hmm.  Well, that's right.  Thomas Alva Edison.  Is he the kind who fucking stole the whole telephone?  Someone stole the telephone.  No, no.  Alexander Graham Bell stole the telephone from some other guy.  Myuchi.  Who was like, yeah, he was going to patent it at the same time.  And they pretty much had a foot race to the patent office.  Is that true, Adam?  Yeah, yeah.  I heard that on The Sopranos.  That's where I get it.  They were probably at the door like pulling each other back.  Norton!  Norton!  Norton!  Norton!  There's a little bit of The Simpsons where they make a joke about it. 
[02:41:30]  I'm Team Tesla myself.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I'm Team Tesla.  Who's Tesla?  Tesla's invented everything.  Tesla and Edison had a little battle back then, too.  Yeah.  That was like the early days.  It was like the rap wars of inventing.  That's right.  Back then, they used to just go at each other.  My dad thought he invented the mixtape.  Really?  My dad came to me with this idea.  He went to me, he goes, I've got an idea, right?  What you do is, everyone has like albums that have just a complete band on it. 
[02:42:00]  What you should do is get an album and have different songs from different bands.  It's crazy.  Right?  And I go, Dad, that's a combination album.  He goes, yeah, but not with the songs that I like.  Oh, well.  Oh, so that's the mix.  I was going to say, it sounded like he was pitching a K-Tel kind of thing.  No, but he thought he did.  He thought, oh, I'm going to fucking market this.  You don't put shit songs together.  Put all good songs.  There you go.  Make that.  Songs I like.  What kind of songs does your dad like?  My dad's a big...  I saw John Denver no less than five times live as a child. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, wow.  Did you enjoy it?  I have a fondness for him because it reminds me of my childhood, but no.  What song?  What song was yours?  Oh, I liked a bit of, well, you like Colorado, Rocky Mountain High.  Leaving on a jet plane, that's a bit.  He didn't like that one.  I couldn't though I sing to your spirit, the man who have served you so long and so well.  That one's a good one.  Right, right, right.  The Calypso, yeah.  Do you know that Country Roads is the most known song in the English language next to Happy Birthday? 
[02:43:00]  Because the Japs love karaoke and it's the number one karaoke song.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  That's the number one karaoke song in the world?  Damn, why that one?  I thought it was I Will Survive.  Country Roads.  People love that.  Country Roads?  Yeah.  People love that.  Take me home to the prairie.  I've been wrong.  It's nothing funnier.  Nothing funnier than watching an Asian guy do American songs at karaoke. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They're so serious.  West Virginia.  Blue Ridge Mountain.  Shenandoah River.  The mule train.  La.  Oh.  And then.  Oh.  I feel so good.  Oh.  Younger than the tree.  Younger than the mountain.  Everybody.  Water like a Breedleys.  Country Roads.  Take me home.  I got a toodle.  Toodle. 
[02:44:00]  Toodle.  Toodle.  West Virginia.  Wait for the toodle-y-do's.  It's the best part.  Can we have a toodle of the day?  Here he goes.  Toodle-y, toodle-y-doo.  Toodle-y, toodle-y-doo.  What the fuck was he doing?  He was in one of those experimental planes. 
[02:44:30]  He suffered from depression.  And he ran out of fucking gas, they think.  No, he just fucking plowed it into the ocean, that guy.  This guy.  I heard he had a fucked up thing with the fuel switching handle was behind his back.  Right.  And he had to switch the tanks in each wing.  And he couldn't get to the fucking fuel switching handle behind him and ran out of fucking gas.  With half a tank of gas left, he ran out of gas.  Why couldn't that happen automatically, though, switching the tanks over?  Because it was a kit plane.  Because it was a little kit plane, yeah. 
[02:45:00]  Little thing.  I don't want to have to pull a lever to make sure the fuel is now being taken from another tank.  Yeah.  I read his biography, right?  Why would you do that?  Because I did.  You are a fan.  And it's called Country Roads Take Me Home.  Of course it is.  The good thing was about him was he sang all these love songs, like Annie's Song and all  that type of stuff.  But he was, it says in the book, like, he alludes to being a wife beater.  Like, he just, like, he doesn't want to go all in, but he's kind of heads. 
[02:45:30]  He's like, sometimes I lost my temper and there were bruises.  There was one time his first wife said, I'm taking half, you know, when they were getting  divorced, then drove off.  She came back to him sitting on a pile of half of all the furniture.  He cut every bit of cunting furniture up with a chainsaw.  The lovely John Danford just sitting there in a psychotic mood, just through the couch.  Get in the car and get on the cunty road, you fucking bitch.  Just drinking.  Like a belter in the eye. 
[02:46:00]  Let's go to Brian in Maryland.  His father's better than your father, John Danford.  Oh, shit.  It wouldn't be hard.  I'm not going to stick up for my dad.  Brian, what do you got on your dad?  My dad is in a John Denver tribute band.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  A band?  Isn't it just one guy?  Isn't he a tribute act?  Yeah, it's a full band.  It's a full band and they get together every year in October on the anniversary of his death  and people come from all over the world and they cry and they have memorials. 
[02:46:30]  Is he the guy?  Is he like the John Denver guy?  He is one of them, yeah.  He sings three or four of the songs and a couple other guys sing three or four of the songs.  Wait, then they bring out another John Denver?  There's different generations of John Denver.  Oh.  Do they share the same wig to look like John Denver?  Oh, no.  They put a guitar on stage that's just remembering him.  And then the last one's called Kit Plain Allen.  Yeah.  There's a competing John Denver band that they rival with to get this one stage every year. 
[02:47:00]  Have a fight?  Knife fight.  There's a rivalry, John Denver.  John Denver knife fight.  Nice.  They all look like John Denver.  Come on, motherfucker.  It's the Sharks and the Jets.  Yeah.  And anybody from Aspen will tell you that he was a well-known partier.  Yeah.  He got multiple DUIs.  Yeah, he got done drink-driving several times, didn't he?  Yeah.  Him and Billy Joel.  Oh, right.  I don't remember him getting DUIs.  So, you know, Brother Joe doing a U2 tribute band, I can understand, but the John Denver 
[02:47:30]  tribute band.  What's the name of the band?  Actually, I think they just called it a tribute to John Denver.  No, they should call it John Bender.  Because sometimes you can find it on YouTube and shit like that, which is pretty funny when  you find these tribute band guys and stuff, and they totally are into it, like Neil Diamond,  and the guy thinks he's fucking Neil Diamond and shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, and it's just embarrassing to watch.  It's like the guy who did Michael Jackson, and then he just kept on changing his face 
[02:48:00]  to fucking move along.  Yeah, he had to keep fucking up his face to stick with that.  Tim, what do you got?  I think I saw a couple years ago up in North Jersey, and there was a black broad in the  front row, and she had blonde hair.  And he pretty much made a comment saying that it was like putting whipped cream on dog shit.  Is this John Denver? 
[02:48:30]  Wow, he really was a part of it.  He got a little crazy.  That's pretty brave on John Denver's part.  Now everyone, thank God I'm a country boy.  You know what?  With statements like that, he should have died.  The world doesn't need him.  No, it was Otto, right?  He was fucking huge in the 70s.  Denver was huge.  Oh my God, huger than fucking...  He had a few hits.  What star was like bigger than him back then?  Dolly Parton, maybe?  I don't know.  Fucking huge. 
[02:49:00]  I used to love him on the Muppet Show, man.  Really?  He was great on the Muppet Show.  Muppet Show is very good.  How old are you?  What?  What are you, a kid?  I love the Muppet Show.  Did you?  My favorite Muppet Show story is the one that Richard Pryor couldn't go on it because  he was free-basting, and he'd been drinking vodka, and then he spilt all over his  shirt, and he's free-wrote, and like some Coke rock falls off into his chest and burns 80% of  his body, and that's the reason he didn't do the Muppet Show, and that's the only episode  not to have a celebrity on it.  He was booked to do it?  He was booked to do the Muppet Show the next day after he got all those boobs. 
[02:49:30]  I never knew that.  Okay, let me say hi to Megan in West Virginia.  Megan.  Mountain mama.  Megan.  Megan.  What's up, Megan?  Uh, I traveled across Europe, uh, same year, 9-11, Amsterdam, Brussels, Prague, Czech Republic,  Germany, everywhere I went, when I would say I was from West Virginia, I didn't even have  to explain it because that fucking song is so popular, it's not just the death.  Oh, West Virginia. 
[02:50:00]  The world's man for a mountain mama, take me home.  I have a mountain mama tattoo.  Is that right next to Titty Mountain Highway?  Oh, God.  I like Colorado Rocky Mountain High.  It was, it was just like, it's a song about him sitting around a fireplace getting stoned  and old people love it, you know.  Well, let's take a listen to that.  You got that, Travis?  No, I don't, actually.  Folks around the campfire and everyone is high.  And when I was in Denver and they said I was in the Rocky Mountains, I did feel, I called  my dad and went, oh, I'm sitting in a plane that doesn't fly. 
[02:50:30]  Anthony Laurie came in.  I'm screaming as I plummet from the sky.  He loved Australia, he wrote a song about Australia, he married, his second wife was  Australian.  Really?  Yeah, you go.  I don't, I feel bad about all this information I know about John Denver.  You really know a lot about that guy.  Yeah, a little too much.  They never found his corpse either, right?  Really?  Yeah, I think it was just disintegrated.  Wow, listen to this.  It became fish food probably, right?  He landed in the ocean.  Yeah.  Larry King checking in, Anthony. 
[02:51:00]  Larry.  Larry.  It was Larry one.  John, since you were unable to switch fuel tanks and flight, what was the first thing that  wouldn't see your mind when you hit the ground?  That's a thing no longer.  He's an asshole.  Gag.  What is this now?  Dave in West Virginia.  Dave?  Hey, this is Dave.  Actually from upstate New York.  I grew up in West Virginia.  All right?  And up there in West Virginia, or down there in West Virginia, John Denver is really popular. 
[02:51:30]  All right?  I mean, he is like the king.  No shit.  Down there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the other thing I was going to tell you is just coming back from Iraq, that song that  he's got, Readjustment Blues, I really identify with that song.  Okay?  I can really identify with it.  Really?  I don't know if you've ever listened to it or not.  Why do you identify with that song?  I don't know.  The Readjusting Blues.  Well, because he's got to readjust because he's coming back from Iraq. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, he's coming back from Iraq.  He's got to get a job, and the economy's not good.  Jeez, I don't care about this country.  Touche, my friend.  Thank you, Dave.  It's hard to, like, you know, just get a job at McDonald's after you've been shooting  people, too.  It's kind of got to readjust.  I hope he calls back.  Yeah, and I talk about how these guys are over there in these crazy tanks and shit, just blowing  up stuff, and then they come back and they now have to drive a minivan or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's like, okay, I'm just...  And follow the rules of the road and all that. 
[02:52:30]  It's like over 50% of all homeless are ex-military or something.  I don't know the exact statistic.  It might even be higher than that.  And this whole idea of you strong or you army strong, it's...  Fuck it up.  It fucks people up, that job, man.  No shit.  Especially if you're in battle.  You're killing people.  You're like, you're told your entire life, that's bad.  That is a bad thing.  You don't kill people.  And then they go, here, kill people.  Right.  But only during this period of time and only here.  The same age as your children, basically. 
[02:53:00]  And then once you go home, you've got to stop killing people.  Now you can't ever kill anyone again.  Yeah, and if you get into a bar fight, don't hurt that guy.  Yeah, you can't kill him.  It's such a weird thing.  It's like, all right, kill as many of them as you can.  These little villages, these little villages they make out in the middle of nowhere.  There was one, I think it was Afghanistan.  It might have been Iraq.  I think it was Afghanistan.  It had like an ice hockey rink in it.  Really?  It had a fucking Burger King, a Subway, and a Pizza Hut.  Oh, I've seen, yeah, I've seen films of those. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  And they walk around, yeah, and then all of a sudden mortals will start flying in on them.  Yeah, but no, I had, the first time I went to Afghanistan, they teach you the duck and roll.  You walk around with your vest on the whole time, and they give you the helmet,  and they go, if you hear the siren, put your helmet on and duck and cover.  Get under the bed, put your hands above your head, and then that's what you do,  and hope the ceiling doesn't fall in, right?  And so I'm there on the first date.  I'm just playing like my PSP, just playing video games, right? 
[02:54:00]  I hear, eh, eh, eh.  I fucking, all the soldiers are watching, but I'm like speed man,  and I fucking duck, roll, under helmet.  And then I hear, can Steve please come to the office?  Can you see?  Oh, shit.  All these soldiers are like, well done, mate, well done.  When you first get there, they fly over the, you fly over Baghdad,  and what happens is they've got like these little wings of the airplane.  When you get over the danger area, they shoot flares out from the little wings,  and then the helicopter goes, like from side to side. 
[02:54:30]  Now the reason for that is the heat-seeking missile comes,  they'll be distracted by the flares, and the helicopter will fly out of range.  But no one told me this was going to happen.  As far as I'm concerned, the wings had just exploded,  and we were all plummeting to our death, right?  And I start screaming, we're going down.  And they're like so happy because they've been waiting for this joke all day.  Oh, man, what a gag.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, yeah, this guy thinks he's dying.  This is going to be really funny.  Fucking lunatics. 
[02:55:00]  They give you when you get off there,  everyone's got like a camouflage bulletproof vest and helmet,  and my one's blue, right?  And I'm like, what the fuck's mine blue?  And they're like, oh, that's so the enemy know that you're a civilian.  I'm like, does the enemy give a shit?  They don't care.  Because every time I got off the helicopter,  I surrounded my soldiers with guns protecting me.  And if I was a sniper, I'd be like, jeez, that cotton blue looks important.  He's got an important guy, right?  Exactly.  Let's go to John and Savannah.  John, I just shot Jim Jeffries. 
[02:55:30]  My boy.  That's all proud of himself.  That'd be good for my career.  John.  Hey, guys.  Didn't anyone else find it weird that Jim Jeffries has a lot more compassion  for John Denver and his death than the victims of 9-11?  Well, I did not have that.  That's a little bizarre.  Can I please say that I have compassion?  No, Jim.  It's back to you now.  Yeah, actually.  It's back to you.  Yeah.  At least he didn't fly the plane into the building, did he?  No, he didn't.  He just went into the ocean.  He didn't hurt anybody.  You know how many fish you probably did?  I was not making fun of 9-11.  When did I say it was a good thing? 
[02:56:00]  No, no.  Not much compassion.  We weren't saying that.  That's what we've noticed today.  Just a little less compassion than for a fucking faggy country singer.  Hey, let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker!  Stryker!  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Stryker!  You were talking about that Colorado Rocky Mountain High song.  A couple years ago, the state legislature here in Colorado wanted to make that state song.  And everybody was saying, how can you make a song about drugs, the state song?  Yeah.  There's a huge controversy about it. 
[02:56:30]  They finally, they kind of like adopted a different version of it, but it was hilarious  when they were going through this.  And yeah, if you talk to people up there in the Aspen area, John Denver was not exactly  the nicest person on the face of the planet.  He had a bit of a temper.  He was a bit of a drinker.  But he, you know, just like Billy Joel likes to wreck his cars, yeah, John Denver did that  several times, too.  Drove off-road through people's hedges and whatnot.  Remember Pink Houses? 
[02:57:00]  John Cougar, Mellencamp there?  Ain't That America for you and me?  Reagan wanted to use that as his campaign song.  Yeah, until I came out of it was about...  I think it was Reagan, or yeah, it could have been.  What the fuck do you live in a pink house?  But the Ain't That America part.  It's like a small town, kind of values, until they told him this is, no, this is an anti-government  fucking kind of a...  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you know Scotland, they signed a petition, they almost got it through, to have the proclaimers 
[02:57:30]  I would walk 100 miles or whatever, as their national anthem.  People were trying to get it through, because it's the only song that people know from Scotland.  That's the only one, yeah.  And they all like to sing it before football games, but it says nothing about Scotland.  Let's go back to the karaoke discussion with this.  What's this?  Yeah, yeah.  You know I love you, baby.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know  that you've been waiting for me, I'm going to, in my age and age and I've been all over 
[02:58:00]  you, I know you got that fever for me, hundred and two, but I know that field us in my temper  through, if there's a camera up here, then it's going to live with me, but I do, I do, if there's a camera up here, then it's best, there's a flig on YouTube, you too, you too, cause if you learn your mother, break a bottle, sick rendezvous, I will hunt you down, cause baby, I'm up in my business like when the interview, but this is thriving, 
[02:58:30]  between when I, touch my body, put me on the floor, lesson me around, play with some more, touch my body, throw me on the bed, I just forgot how to speak to you.  That's fantastic.  Throw me on the bed.  Tuts.  Tuts, my.  Tuts.  You people are racist.  Yeah.  You're racist.  Yeah.  Yeah, wow. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Say hi to Sean.  Sean's the only one.  you got the song wrong  about the Reagan thing, Ant.  I don't know.  Let's see.  What?  It might have been someone else,  but was it Born in the USA  he wanted to use it?  Born in the USA  is what he actually used.  What?  That's what he actually used.  I knew it was Pink Houses.  He didn't want to use it.  And he tried to outlaw  the Twisted Sister  We're Not Gonna Take It song  because he said  it was bad for the youth.  And then...  Reagan?  Yeah, Reagan did.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, he said that song  was bad for the youth.  And then someone used it. 
[02:59:30]  Like John Kerry  or something like that.  Someone recently used it  in their campaign.  Really?  Yeah, I remember stuff.  I remember Reagan saying that, though.  Oh, you read a lot.  I don't like Twisted Sister.  No.  Want to take a break?  He did say well a lot.  We'll take a break  and then we'll finish up  with Jim Jefferies  and Otto and George.  You got Jim Jefferies  at Caroline's tonight  and tomorrow and Sunday  212-757-4100  and the great Otto 
[03:00:00]  from Otto and George.  Absolutely.  Did you bring in  the puppet today, Otto?  I didn't.  I'm going at two hours sleep.  It's one of those fucking...  You don't need the puppets.  It's right here.  Just say the puppeteer.  We would have believed you.  I know.  He wants to do the thing.  Yeah.  Cock.  Cock.  Whatever.  He puts his hand up on the...  Cock.  Cock.  Cock.  Tonight and tomorrow, Otto,  and I highly recommend  you go see Otto and George.  With Reverend Levy,  another fucking lunatic.  Yeah.  The comedy shop  in Pinebrook, New Jersey.  You know what?  You could go see Jefferies  and then the next night  see Otto and George  or vice versa, whatever. 
[03:00:30]  It's a weekend of comedy, man.  It's a nice club, though.  I'm playing some shitbox, probably.  Nice plug.  I'm sure.  I'm sure the fine people  at the comedy shop  appreciates that there.  Can I plug my DVD?  It comes out  on October the 13th as well.  Ooh.  Jim Jefferies' DVD.  We're going to finish up  with these guys  in just a few.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Jefferies,  Otto from Otto and George  on a Friday, 
[03:01:00]  a miserable Friday  here in New York City.  Mark in Jersey.  What do you got, Mark?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, Mac.  Pretty good, Mark.  The Pentagon's just been hit.  Listen, I just wanted  to call up and tell you guys  eight years later,  the day that the attacks happened,  and I was listening to your show,  as I always do.  And, Opie, I just want  to thank you for one thing  you did.  I don't know if you recall.  Maybe one day  you can replay the tape.  But you played a song  by Metallica 
[03:01:30]  that basically pumped up  I'll Call the Spirits  of the Rockers  that was called  Don't Tread on Me,  which is one of my favorite  songs by them.  And I just want to thank you  for that because everybody,  of course,  was all fucked up that day  and you really brought  spirits up as far  as I'm concerned.  I'm a former  Navy SEAL,  you know,  did the military thing  and everything.  Definitely know  there was no  thermite paint  used that day.  He's so full of shit  his fucking eyes are brown. 
[03:02:00]  It really is an insult  to a lot of people  when he comes up  with that shit.  I've been listening  to you guys  for a long, long time  and I just wanted  to thank you for that.  No worries, bro.  Thank you, Mark.  I appreciate it.  Okay, have a great day.  You know, we'll end our show  with Don't Tread on Me  today there, Danny.  How about that?  That is a good one.  That's not going to be  a problem.  That is good.  Yeah, we're distracted  because they're doing  in real time.  I hate when they do  the real time thing  because, you know,  eh.  If you rewind it,  the buildings go back up.  Yeah.  Boy. 
[03:02:30]  Unfortunately.  How about a little  compassion before we leave?  How about just a little bit?  Just a tad.  You know, just a tad.  Just an ounce of...  Yeah, look at that.  That's not a control.  Look, the...  I'm just glad that  John Deville wasn't alive  to see this.  I hate conspiracy theorists.  They should end that list  with Pete Best, too,  you know?  Just because he fucked  so badly.  Holy shit.  And Pete Best.  Oh, my God.  Pete Best.  That is classic.  Because he...  He...  No one has gotten 
[03:03:00]  fucked harder  than Pete Best  over the years.  Pete Best.  So at least throw him  on the list of names  so his name is read  every year.  He does a little tour  every now and again.  Pete Best.  Who did we have in it?  Bob Smith.  Did we have Pete Best in?  We had Pete Best.  Did you have Pete Best?  Did we have Pete Best in  at NAW?  The listeners know more than us  and we did these shows.  You had the original  drama for the Beatles  and you can't freaking remember.  It was either him  or another guy  that got fucked.  There was a few guys  that got fucked  with that whole Beatles thing.  Wow. 
[03:03:30]  Well, you know  one of the things...  Australian faggot.  Yep.  Bally bombing.  Bally bombing.  Fuck you,  you Australian fag.  Yep.  That's what you get, Jim.  Oh, man.  What have I done wrong?  Oh, man.  Are they turning on you?  What about the John Dever thing?  It's a happy childhood.  Fucking...  I...  I...  Of course I have compassion  for everything  that happened in 9-11.  What the fuck?  Yeah, you came in here  and started talking  about the metric system.  We got bigger things 
[03:04:00]  to talk about today.  Fuck you,  you Aussie fucking cunt.  Fuck.  They're going  Bally bombing.  Ha ha.  Yeah, and it's pronounced  barley.  Like, that's fucking ridiculous.  Oh, Pete Best.  This poor...  Look at him.  Pete Best.  How much money  do you think he makes  a year as the remaining Beatles  and their wives  and their kids  make just millions  and millions  every fucking year?  What really fucked him  was he wouldn't  change his hairdo.  The rest of them  all got a mop tops.  He was better looking  than any of them.  McCartney wanted  to be the cute one.  But then John Lennon 
[03:04:30]  said that Pete Best  was a great drummer  but Ringo was  a great Beatle.  So that was...  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's what he meant.  John Lennon said  that famous quote  where they went  is Ringo Starr  the best rock drummer  in the world.  And he went,  Ringo Starr's not the best  drummer in the Beatles.  He actually said that.  He actually said it.  Even McCartney's  a really good drummer.  I don't think  there's going to be  a Pete Best rock band.  No.  I don't think  they're going to have  a guitar hero.  He goes a little too  as Pete Best.  I do a little theater  sometimes where I see posters. 
[03:05:00]  He comes out  and does 60 shots.  I meant the game.  Yeah, the Beatles rock band  just came out two days ago.  You think they threw him  a bony list?  You think Pete Best  got a couple of bucks?  Well, fucking throw him in there  so he could get a few bucks  to pay his bills.  He might be in those  early bits of the game  in the cavern.  But you have the  Pete Best rock band  where it's like  you play one song  and then you bake bread  for the rest of it.  And the drum breaks  and you can't play it anymore.  And look at Pete Best today.  He's still out there  just trying to make a living.  He's touring with  a Frank Sinatra Jr. impersonator.  Oh, shit. 
[03:05:30]  That's Pete Best?  He's still just trying  to make it.  He looks like he could be  in one of Joe's bands.  Oh, look at him.  I'm Pete Best.  Oh, my God.  Look at me.  I played with the Beatles  before they were...  And what is it?  Oh, look at him.  Poor guy.  He doesn't sympathize  about 9-11 at all.  I know.  He's a little happy.  That's a great line.  How did he not kill himself?  I know.  Really?  Watching him  on the Ed Sullivan show.  To miss that ride.  That fucking ride  that he missed out on.  Oh, my God. 
[03:06:00]  He did all the shit gigs  right up to the second  he made it.  Yeah.  It was Epstein  who kicked him out.  It wasn't the other guys.  Epstein just didn't think  he gelled right.  Yeah.  You know.  We did have Pete Best  on the show.  It would make you  a bit homophobic,  wouldn't it?  Damn, that's...  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Fuck that guy.  That fag.  What he did to me.  He just wanted me.  What did we say  to Pete Best?  I guarantee we were  dicks tall.  Oh, we did have a line.  It was one really  kind of like,  ooh, douchey.  Maybe some of the 
[03:06:30]  old school listeners  could pull up  and let us know.  Jeff, what do you got?  Hello.  Yes.  I was at this shitty  dive bar in Roanoke  where I live  and Pete Best  played an act there  and the opening act  was a band  that we had hired  for a party  that we threw  about two months before  and he was yelling,  Roanokey, Roanokey, Roanokey.  It was a disaster.  I bet he made  50 bucks that night.  Oh, God.  Yeah, but just the  interviewing circuit  and stuff.  Like, you're going  on tonight shows  and stuff.  I think if you put it out  that he could still 
[03:07:00]  get on Letterman  if...  He was on our show.  Yeah, yeah.  And you don't pay, do you?  I've never had a cent.  No.  And this was 10 years ago  before we were really  doing anything  of significance.  He was a baker,  wasn't he,  for a long time?  He became a...  Just to add him  to the list of names.  Oh, that old joke.  There were rumors  that Brian Epstein  slept with John Lennon  but we know the fact  is he fucked Pete Best.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  Wow.  Steve from Bayshore,  thank you for that one.  Yeah, right on.  Let's go to  Footer.  Footer?  Goody, we get it.  What's up, Footer?  Just wanted to say,  yeah, Jim Jefferies,  I'm a big fan  but I just tuned in  and it's very clear to me  that you just hate America.  Oh, I don't hate him.  Oh, and he said  good luck at Caroline.  Oh, boy.  Otto just went,  Otto just went  we should put Pete Best  on the dead list.  If your relative  was on the dead list, 
[03:08:00]  you'd be going,  well, that's not the same.  Being kicked out of the drummer  isn't the same as dying  but no one gets into Otto.  See, you don't get,  no, you don't get it  because that's  scooping up Pete Best.  Whose team,  whose family got more  fucked in that though?  What?  Pete Best.  You know,  he was a money maker  if he stayed in the Beatles.  Oh, my God.  Opie, you're disgusting me.  This is appalling  what you've ever had.  Look, there's darkness  among us today  so I'm just trying to lighten  the buggy.  You're anti-human.  You're not just Americans.  This is a nervous 
[03:08:30]  Did the guy actually go  good luck at Caroline?  Am I going to get lynched tonight?  Is there going to be  a real problem?  This is just nervous laughter  from, you know,  having to look at  the tragedies of the day.  Before we move on  from Pete Best,  yes, thank you, Mark.  I'll let Mark say.  At the line?  Yes, and it was Kimmy  Kimmy from  fucking Survivor.  Survivor used to be  a friend of ours  from one of the first Survivors.  She used to do our show  all the time.  She was in studio  getting naked or something.  Yes.  We were able to get her naked  and she said,  go ahead, Mark.  You take it from there. 
[03:09:00]  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Kimmy was in studio  and she said,  weren't you happy  when John Lennon got shot?  Right.  That was it.  To Pete Best.  That was her question.  We're like,  Kimmy, you got a question  for Pete Best?  Yeah, were you happy  when John Lennon got shot?  What did Pete Best say?  Yes.  No, I have no idea.  I don't remember the answer.  Did he laugh?  The question was too fucking much.  I know I turned my head away.  I couldn't look.  Uncomfortable moment.  Yeah, it really was.  Dumb cunt. 
[03:09:30]  It's terrible.  I wonder if she's still around.  Don't watch this.  Hey, this Kimmy girl.  I don't know why I keep watching.  I thought you said  she was a friend.  No, she used to.  Years ago.  We had plenty of friends  that were on air, friends.  Friends with quotations.  And then years go by  and you're like,  oh, remember how fucking good  friends they were  on the air for us  and everything?  And then they just go away.  What happened to your friend  that used to call in?  The guy was really sick  all the time.  Is he around still?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remember that?  We had a call every Friday.  Tom.  The guy, yeah,  when he fired the gun 
[03:10:00]  once on the air.  And it was his Tom dead.  Is he still okay?  He called our show.  Yeah, I think.  I don't know.  Maybe if he's around  he can go around.  Jim Jeffries,  this guy,  terminal disease.  And one day  he calls up with a gun  in his hand  and he was ready  to do it live on show.  He was ready to do it.  And then we kind of  talked about it.  Well, we did talk him  out of it or Anthony.  And then the gun  went off by accident.  Yeah, I remember that day.  And then the police  had to get involved  and they took him away  for a while.  He was speaking  after he had the shot.  He didn't just make  you think.  He actually said  something like,  oops, or, 
[03:10:30]  I didn't mean it.  I don't know,  it was something.  Yeah, but he said  once the disease  gets bad enough  where he really  can't live any kind  of life,  he's just going to end it.  So he called up  and was like,  it's really bad,  I can't move.  Do you know  this thing in,  I think it was,  euthanasia is legal  in Holland  because the Dutch  are, you know,  they're go-ahead people.  They're cool with anything.  But there's also,  there was this idea  that these people had  for,  they get a cruise ship,  take it out  to international waters  and perform all the  euthanasias out there. 
[03:11:00]  Ah.  Right?  Because there's no,  there's no laws.  But that's like,  have you ever been  in a cruise ship  where everyone's  those streamers  and stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  Would it be the same  as that?  Where there's all these  old women in wheelchairs  and old men.  And they're like,  bon voyage!  Wave goodbye to grandma!  Wave goodbye.  Bon voyage!  She's off on a little holiday.  That's a good way  to go out.  Thinking you've got  a nice cruise.  But like,  you might be sitting  on the boat going,  jeez,  it's fucking,  it's nice out here,  isn't it?  I've got something 
[03:11:30]  to live for.  We've got Al,  Al-Qaeda checking in.  Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda?  Yeah.  Al,  first name,  Qaeda,  last name.  Al.  Hey,  hello,  I'm Jim Jeffries.  We love you over here.  Oh,  damn,  man.  If I'm so anti-American,  why do I go out  and entertain American troops  in Iraq and Afghanistan?  And take,  put my life in danger  for free,  right?  Oh,  boy.  I can't believe  that I've been made  into a terrorist 
[03:12:00]  on this show.  You really have.  What did I say  that was so bad?  Name me one thing  that I said  that was so bad,  if anyone can remember.  Play it in reverse  and the buildings  stand back up.  Oh,  yeah,  was that bad?  Yeah.  It was just a bad joke.  And I wouldn't repeat it.  I wouldn't repeat  the rest of it.  No way.  Carolyn,  what's up?  Hey,  I'm just calling  about some news  I saw on live  with CNN.  What?  Breaking news,  boat challenge,  Coast Guard,  they shot 10 rounds  at the boat.  Where?  It's on the Potomac River.  What'd you say?  What kind of fucking boat  is going to, 
[03:12:30]  what is it,  Somali Pirates  on the Potomac?  They say it's a vessel.  That's all they're saying  right now.  It's in the restricted zone  and they're ignoring  the Coast Guard.  Really?  Let's go to CNN  and check that shit out.  CNN,  why is everything else  still playing the fucking,  if we got real breaking news,  they should.  I'm not going to make jokes about it.  It'll make me anti-American.  Thank you,  Karen.  Don't fuck with the Coast Guard.  Is that true?  Do we know that?  I don't know.  Titty Mountain Highway!  I think she's full of shite.  Let's see. 
[03:13:00]  Did we do everything else?  We talked about  the South African runner.  You hear this story?  The Coast Guard tries to keep  boat out of area  in your pentagon.  Don't tell me,  was she racist?  Yes.  You don't know this story?  No, I've heard she's a man  or something.  Well, she's both.  But she doesn't have ovaries  or a womb  and her testes are inside.  On the inside.  Well, you can't get into her for that.  That doesn't make you an athlete.  What are they supposed  to do with her?  Who is she supposed  to run against?  Has she got long hair?  Her mistake,  like we said earlier,  she has like male abs. 
[03:13:30]  She got tits?  No, not really.  They're pecs.  What was she born as then?  Hermaphrodite.  Oh, hermaphrodite.  Born like, okay.  No womb, no ovaries  and has testicles  that are inside.  She's like a frog.  Yeah, it's fucked up.  If she went to a party,  would she wear a dress?  Oh, good question.  We just said  all it would take  is a smell.  You smell.  You just smell  and know it smells like balls  even though they're on the inside.  Could a man fuck her?  Is there a hole there? 
[03:14:00]  Should be a vag.  Yeah, but she's got  three times the amount  of testosterone  of normal women.  Jesus, what the fuck  is that about?  Look at that thing.  Wow, that is a fucking...  Anthony, I'm sorry.  One of Jim Jefferies' relatives  is calling the show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, for real.  Fuck off.  For real.  Oh, let's see who it is.  It's Osama bin Jefferies.  Osama!  This is Osama bin Jefferies.  You are correct.  Now, listen.  Why did you change your name?  What are you so embarrassed about? 
[03:14:30]  Come home.  You have training to finish.  Oh, damn.  We have 144,000 virgins  or whatever the fuck it is  waiting for you.  We can't cut your belt.  We've all got a little hole in it  for the dynamite sticks.  Jesus.  All right.  Why are you some type of terrorist?  Thank you, Osama bin Jefferies.  Osama bin Jefferies.  Osama bin Jefferies.  What the fuck is that?  You know, we've always said 
[03:15:00]  our listeners are the funniest  on the radio,  but they've stepped up  their game this week.  Yeah, thank God.  I don't know what the fuck  happened, but man,  they got even funnier.  Tom in Chicago.  What's up, Tom?  It's Tim.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Tim.  I was wondering when it was  Jim Jefferies converted  to Al-Qaeda.  You've got to turn  this thing around, really.  You've got shows  to sell out here, my friend.  God bless America.  I love you all.  Oh, that's good.  Down with...  I called them muzzies.  Wasn't that enough?  It was good.  That was degrading.  I'm going to start using that.  Muzzies. 
[03:15:30]  I'm going to start using  guilties, too.  You've got muzzies  and packies.  No, muzzies isn't a...  It's just me and my mates  say the word muzzies.  That's kind of fun, though.  That should catch on.  Yeah.  The most racist thing  I've heard of late...  Oh, I'm not going to...  I'll tell you off here.  Oh, yeah?  No, it's not...  Really bad?  No.  Write it down.  Write it down.  What ethnic group  does it involve?  We like playing write it down.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's a touching situation.  Here's a sharpie.  No, no, no.  I'll tell you afterwards.  It was just a new word  that I heard.  No, it's a lot of explaining.  It's like a big thing. 
[03:16:00]  I like the old word.  The new word's Mondays?  Have you heard that?  No.  No one likes Mondays.  It's not a good...  Holy shit!  Okay, I gotcha.  Inappropriate, Phil.  Oh, I'm not judging.  That's just why I heard it.  No, that's good.  You're making points with our audience.  They're a bunch of racist fucks.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to get back in  and off the muzzies.  I think you're in. 
[03:16:30]  I think it's time for the line of the day,  and what do you think?  The line of the...  We know what the line of the day is.  Everyone knows what it is.  On a shitty weather Friday.  And then we get to play Metallica.  Don't tread on meat today,  nice and loud for everybody.  I like it.  Because we did that eight years ago today.  Oh, Larry King's checking in, though.  I'd like to say sorry to the people of America.  All right, let's do our first runner-up line of the day.  One night had to happen.  Ricky just fucking grabbed it.  Grabbed it home.  Big, giant, red pussy.  You know, it was just a giant bush, too. 
[03:17:00]  Red bush.  Red bush.  Big clown fucking bush.  Those bushes.  Clown hair bush.  Her big fucking red bush, right?  And then his coarse black Cuban hair  just banging together like that.  Wow.  The Cuban Missile Crisis.  Yeah, that was like...  The Cuban Missile Crisis.  His unclipped missile.  That's a paragraph again.  That's a paragraph.  Paragraph of the day.  Paragraph of the day.  Dr. Steve wants to promote his show 
[03:17:30]  that's on Saturday night at 9 o'clock,  Weird Medicine.  He should have...  What, is he sleeping?  The Lazy Fuck Caller show?  He's a doctor for the love of God.  And promote your own goddamn radio show.  He's a doctor.  He better get his ass on the phone.  Hold on a minute, Ant.  Larry King is checking in.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I wanted to ask Jim Jeffries  how important is hating America  to your comedy show?  Good question, Larry King.  I would have no material without it. 
[03:18:00]  Let's go to Bobby.  Bobby.  Hey, Bobby.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Bobby.  Hey, Jim.  What song do you come out to?  Black IDs?  Boom, boom, boom?  Oh, that's just silly.  Now you're just being me.  Now you're just...  Jim Jeffries will be at Caroline's  tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday,  212-757-4100.  I got an early, late show,  and I'll be getting my head kicked in an alleyway.  It's all good.  Another runner-up line of the day.  The first time I went to Afghanistan,  they teach you the duck and roll. 
[03:18:30]  You walk around with your vest on the whole time,  and they give you the helmet,  and they go,  if you hear the siren,  put your helmet on,  and duck and cover.  Get under the bed,  put your hands above your head,  and then that's what you do,  and hope the ceiling doesn't fall in.  And so I'm there on the first date.  I'm just playing like my PSP,  just playing video games, right?  I hear...  I fucking...  All the soldiers are watching,  but I'm like speed man,  and I fucking duck, roll, under, helmet.  And then I hear,  can Steve please come to the office?  Can Steve... 
[03:19:00]  Oh, shit.  It's a paragraph of the day.  Another paragraph.  We all know what line of the day is  that's going to win.  He only said about two jokes the whole show,  but we know what it is.  He fucking nailed it.  Otto doesn't need a lot of bass hits, my friend.  I know, I know.  He gets up to that plane,  and he hits them out of the fucking park for everybody.  My comedy is like a scatter bomb.  That's when you pull out your fucking camera.  I just throw it out there  and hope that something will hit.  I got something for Anthony.  I know SiriusXM is trying to turn around  the company a little bit.  Yeah.  But do we really have to like  make up some money  by doing Japanese tours today? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, it does look like  we're at Radio City or something.  Our boss is showing a bunch of...  It's like NBC Studios tour.  A bunch of those people.  Yeah.  Around the facility.  They're called Pearl Harbors.  Oh, shit.  Let me say hi to Matt in Queensbury.  Matt?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, I got a knock-knock joke  for Jim Jeffries.  Hey, Jim, knock-knock.  Who's there?  9-11.  9-11 who?  I thought you said you wouldn't.  See, that's fucking offy. 
[03:20:00]  He already forgot that call.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  You fucking forgot, Jim.  You wouldn't forget.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  You're not supposed to forget.  Never forget.  Right.  Time for the line of the day, I think.  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I'm just glad that John Devon 
[03:20:30]  wasn't alive to see this.  I hate conspiracy theorists.  Yeah.  They should end that list  with Pete Best, too, you know.  Holy shit.  Get him out in highway!  Great.  That was a slow burn of that line.  It took us a while to get it.  We were like...  It was that good a line  that we were like...  Right the fuck on, Otto.  I'm a wet fuse.  Otto's going to be at the comedy shop  with Reverend Bob Levy  tonight and tomorrow.  Sorry.  Pinebrook, New Jersey. 
[03:21:00]  JJComedy.com  or call 866-552-6633.  Extension 1.  You got a lot of comedy  this weekend, people.  Yes.  Figure it out.  What night do you see Jim  and what night do you see Otto?  That's all you have to worry about.  It comes out the 13th of October.  10% of all proceeds go to Al Qaeda.  Let me say hi to Matt on Long Island.  Matt.  Matt?  What happened here?  Let's try that again.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Matt.  Hey, Jim. 
[03:21:30]  Do you burn a flag during the early show  or the late show tonight?  Is it not?  When does the American flag burning take place?  I won my ass with it in the first show.  Burn it in the second.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Hey, Jim, you traitor.  When are you going to yell out  Baba Booey?  I don't even remember saying anything bad.  I can't remember exactly what I did.  Listen to the replay.  Yeah.  You'll hear it.  That's why I'm going to go home.  I'm going to go home and listen to the show again.  Yeah, just listen to it and go,  I remember saying that.  Anthony, Bulletin.  Coast Guard incident in D.C. 
[03:22:00]  was a drill, supposedly.  Getting that news coming in.  See?  Just stop.  All right, Otto.  Good to see you, buddy.  Thanks, brother.  Jim, good to see you.  I'll be at one of the shows this weekend.  I don't miss Jim Jeffries.  Cool.  I wish you were closer.  Maybe I go to the comedy shop.  Maybe I take a ride.  How far from the city?  45 to an hour, I think.  It's a schlep, but...  Have fun this weekend, Otto.  Yeah.  It's a little far.  You know I love you, but...  I know, I know. 
[03:22:30]  If it was 10 minutes...  I hear that.  Why don't we play Don't Tread on Me?  We did this eight years ago,  and that guy with that fine phone call  reminded us of that.  So we'll crank this out for everybody  to start their weekend.  And we'll see you guys Monday.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  We'll be right back.
