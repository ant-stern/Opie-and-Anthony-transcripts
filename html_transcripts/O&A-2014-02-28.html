<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts discussing Eric's illness and the resulting listener concern, transitioning into banter about the cold weather, upcoming snow, and the absurdity of the Huntington St. Patrick's Day parade and its controversial floats.  The conversation then shifted to recent controversies surrounding Paula Deen and a gay football player, focusing on offensive language and public backlash. This led to a debate on political correctness, fueled by examples from news headlines and punctuated by offensive language from the hosts, despite Opie's stated attempt to curse less.  Callers Tom from Cleveland (discussing a California school banning American flag shirts on Cinco de Mayo) and Mike from Virginia (unsuccessfully attempting to relate a Daniel Snyder story) contributed to this segment.  The hosts then previewed their upcoming guest, Jim Ross, and his anticipated Vince McMahon anecdotes, before a Dr. Steve Medical Minute segment warned of the dangers of sleeping pills.  The show then briefly returned to music, discussing U2's longevity, criticizing an Asia song, and playing a Robert Plant track with Opie's commentary.  A call from Kevin in Connecticut prompted further musical discussion before a surprise weigh-in for Roland and E-Rock, detailing their weight changes and dietary habits since a weight-loss competition. Nathan from Texas called in with his own weight loss perspective. The segment concluded with discussion about Scott Ferrall's new radio show and the lack of response from CBS FM regarding Opie's attempts to book him as a guest.

The next segment featured professional wrestling announcer Jim Ross as a guest.  Prior to his arrival, the hosts discussed a former colleague, “Todd,” and speculated on a potential interview with a news reporter, Scott.  Jim Ross then joined the show, initially unaware he was on the air. He shared his life story, including his Californian birth, Oklahoma upbringing (claiming conception on Route 66), his logger father, and how his wrestling career began after a college fraternity fundraiser. He discussed his early career struggles, including low pay and lack of insurance, and frankly addressed his three marriages and the reasons for their failures.  Ross detailed his role in negotiating the sale of Bill Watts' company and the subsequent rise of Vince McMahon and WCW.  He shared numerous anecdotes about working with McMahon, highlighting McMahon's demanding and often profane management style, and mentioned wrestlers Mick Foley and Taz.  He also discussed his role in discovering and signing talents like Mick Foley, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Rock, sharing revealing and funny stories about each. Ross explained his departure from WWE, attributing it to a poorly handled SummerSlam appearance with Ric Flair, impacted by Flair’s son’s heroin overdose, clarifying that any perceived inebriation on his part was due to Bell's palsy. He discussed future plans, including spoken word tours and podcasting.

Continuing the Jim Ross interview,  he discussed his career transition from WWE, his podcast "The Ross Report," and upcoming one-man shows, including one with Mick Foley. He described the early days of professional wrestling as involving "sex, drugs, and rock and roll" and the lack of athletic commissions.  He detailed the tragic death of Owen Hart, comparing the on-air announcement to Cronkite's Kennedy announcement, and discussed the high death rate among wrestlers, attributing it to a lack of self-control and the availability of substances. He praised WWE's improved wellness program.  The conversation also touched on the "Montreal Screwjob" and a funny anecdote about Vince McMahon soiling his pants on air. Ross also mentioned a new deal with Fox Sports to write about WrestleMania. Following Ross's departure, a "Cock Talk" segment featured caller Mars detailing a graphic homosexual experience. The hosts then returned, discussing Ross's interview, Ric Flair's behavior, a news reporter discreetly sucking snot back into her nose, and a couple who found a large cache of gold coins. Colin Quinn called in to criticize the hosts’ interview style.


The following segment began with the hosts discussing anxieties about their power over guests and the potential repercussions of criticism. They mentioned Colin Quinn's critiques and the perceived entitlement of some guests, particularly a host named Sam.  They also discussed the Oscars and Super Show 3, making humorous predictions and criticizing unrealistic depictions of teeth in period films like *12 Years a Slave*.  A significant portion analyzed their colleague Todd's new radio show, noting changes in format, reduced phone scams, and a perceived toning down of content, discussing their past with Todd and the apparent erasure of their contributions from the station's history.  The highlight was a surprise call from Scott Shannon, leading to humorous anecdotes about their past and playful banter.  Various humorous moments occurred, including impressions, Oscar jokes, a phone scam, and a brief interaction with someone mistaken for Spike Lee.  Eric left the studio mid-segment.

The final segment covered a holiday party the hosts hosted, featuring guests like "Lady Di," a heavy drinker with greasy hair, and "Twato" (Sandy Cain), a former peep show performer with a prominent genital growth.  The hosts recounted this with crude humor.  The segment also included a brief conversation with Stassi, a guest whose appearance caused trouble. The hosts then discussed social media, commenting on negative interactions and differing follower counts, concluding with a GoToMeeting advertisement and multiple farewells.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, morning everybody.  Hi.  It's Friday.  It certainly is.  We're live.  I call it Frigid Friday.  Oh, cold enough for you? 
[00:00:30]  Put that gun away.  Yeah.  I had a scheduled day off yesterday.  Eric did not.  No.  But for some reason, I had to hear about it.  I had a sick day.  What happened?  I don't want to feel like that.  Why is Sam looking like that?  What?  I went, ooh.  Come on.  Ooh.  Well, I had a scheduled day off.  I had some big business to attend to yesterday.  Yeah.  And I'm getting phone calls because he's not here.  Big business.  I'm like, I don't know what to tell you.  Call him. 
[00:01:00]  Call me.  The fuck?  What's that?  I was scheduled not to be here.  What's up, Mars?  Can I have sick days?  I've written my contract.  Yeah.  You get to be sick?  I get to.  I'm allowed.  It's amazing.  I'm panicking on Twitter.  Huh?  The show's suspended?  What?  And then you got to think back.  What did we do the day before that people would think we're suspended?  What?  Why are they surprised by now?  He takes last year to sick days all the time. 
[00:01:30]  Eh.  What's the shit?  Why are they surprised?  I don't know.  We'll be back.  We're always back.  Yeah, I guess for now.  What?  We'll be back until we're not back.  And then you can panic.  Fuck, then I'll panic.  Why?  I need a job.  Oh, shit.  You got a J.O.B.  Yeah.  B.  You're fucking, uh, you're on it.  Trying to get that paper.  You're on it.  You're fucking doing shows.  Just stop with paper and all that.  You're not that cool.  Paper. 
[00:02:00]  Mars, he's not that cool, right?  Thank you.  He tries to act like he's this over-the-top, edgy hipster.  You're trying too hard.  All right.  Maybe you're right.  You're going to hang with Brother Weez for a little while.  He'll fucking teach you the way to be, you know, actually cool.  Try to get that money, brother man.  Paper.  Paper.  Sounded like me when I said cheddar back in the day.  Ah.  I played cheddar days.  You know, we got a cheddar.  Got any of that cheddar.  Some cheddar, yo.  This fucking winter. 
[00:02:30]  I'll say it.  What the fuck?  Enough already.  I fucking have it.  I don't know all these guys, because I lived in Buffalo for a while, when you just have  out-of-control snow and weather.  I kind of like it.  It brings me back to my western New York roots.  When you were putting up numbers?  When I was putting up numbers.  Ah.  With that fucking mullet.  With the mullet.  But enough.  Enough.  What's going on?  It's fucking freezing.  It's like 10 degrees, I guess.  It's, uh, yeah.  Then they do the real feel.  It's minus six.  Minus six real feel. 
[00:03:00]  Minus six with the wind chill.  And now they're saying six to ten inches of snow on Sunday.  Sunday, more snow.  Into Monday.  Fucking ridiculous.  This is amazing.  God damn ridiculous.  So.  Is it a polar vortex?  Yeah, I think we're doing a polar vortex thing.  Wow.  We're just still spinning through that thing.  The polar vortex.  Another one.  But they're saying this weather's going to be with us until middle of next week.  Yeah.  Middle of next week?  Are we even going to get a fucking, like, one of those inkling days where you're like, 
[00:03:30]  oh, it gives you a little inkling of spring.  Yeah.  Were you sleeping through that?  That was it.  It was 60 degrees out.  No, no, no.  Do you remember?  I had the windows open and everything.  And you felt that nice breeze, right?  It was nice.  But you know what the thing is?  There was fucking snow on the ground.  Oh.  Still.  Well, it was supposed to melt most of the snow, but it did not.  Yeah.  So it's kind of like, you know, it might be nicer, but it doesn't give you that nice spring feel.  Sure.  I want no more snow and 60.  That'd be nice. 
[00:04:00]  We're getting there.  Yeah.  Today's the last day of February.  Usually it's January and February you got to worry about.  And then it's like smooth sailing.  Well, March, in like a lion and out like a lamb.  Well, some would say.  So they say.  I mean, you know, now we cruise right to the St. Paddy's Day parade.  Oh, yes.  In Huntington, in front of FH Riley's.  Oh, right.  And every year when I go there, you just feel springs in the air.  Ah, yes.  And then it's right around the corner. 
[00:04:30]  I do believe I was there last year.  Were you?  Yeah.  What about the year Bobo showed up?  I don't know.  He shows up every year.  I don't know.  Fucking hell.  Yeah, you had the wee ones there.  I was there.  Yeah.  You were there.  Yeah.  We were both there.  Yes.  No, I had my young son.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  And then we checked out the parade.  The boring ass who gives a fuck parade.  Man, is that a terrible parade.  There's not a good parade out there.  I don't know why we still do parades.  It's archaic. 
[00:05:00]  The fucking one band after another.  And then the Huntington St. Patrick's Day parade.  I guess if you're a resident, you just walk the streets and you're part of the parade and  supposedly that's supposed to be special or something.  Yeah.  It's garbage.  It's just people walking around with the St. Paddy's hats, like the cardboard ones and  stuff.  And they walk around waving, but it's like, who is that guy?  He's just some guy.  They're nobodies.  They're absolutely nobodies.  A lot of car dealership cars.  Right.  Drive by with the car dealership name on the side and someone waving in the convertible top. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And then you get some fire trucks that have to blast their sirens five feet from your  old man ears because you've been doing fucking radio since you were 18.  Oh my God, does that fucking hurt.  They really, it is a horrible parade.  Parades stink.  And in New York City, they close down the streets almost every weekend for a parade.  Starting St. Paddy's Day, I think is the first official parade of the year.  And then almost every weekend, there's a parade. 
[00:06:00]  Some other fucking cause or ethnic background.  Well, they have to do every ethnic background.  Yeah.  Almost every ethnic background gets their parade.  Yep.  And it's one after another that just stinks and just snarls traffic.  And a parade, I mean, floats are terrible too, but at least a float, you could be like,  oh, wow, that's kind of creative.  Right.  There's no floats in the St. Paddy's Day parade, so it's just people walking.  There's no floats because, you know, a few guys ruined it for everybody else up there.  Oh, yeah, some of the comedy, their interpretation of comedy. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, boy.  So there's no floats for anyone.  They thought, what was it, the Black to the Future one got some people in trouble.  Black to the Future was probably the most famous float in our area.  Yeah.  That was a big one.  That was a big one.  That was a big one.  That was a big one.  Someone thought that was a good idea.  Who thought that was a good idea?  We support free speech and the PC BS, but we also have to use our brains, people.  You've got to know that's going to make some trouble. 
[00:07:00]  You know that's going to make some noise.  You've got to pick your battles, and that ain't one you want to be in.  Oh, man, no.  Who's in trouble today?  Who's in trouble today?  It is a daily occurrence.  I was on CNN, because I woke up at 4.15, even though I could sleep until 5.15 nowadays.  Damn.  And I went on CNN, and I saw, like, it was a headline, someone's in trouble.  Was what blah blah said racist?  And I just went, you know what?  I'm not clicking on these anymore.  Who cares?  Because there's one every day. 
[00:07:30]  It's every fucking day someone's in Dutch.  But now I guess I want to know who it was, just because I sort of, like, saw the headline.  Was it, what's her name, that cook woman?  Paula Dane.  Paula Dane.  Paula Dane, I'm just like that gay football player.  The gay football player.  Oh, she's a jerk.  Yeah.  I hate Paula Dane.  She was, uh, chastised.  And not because she might have, well, I guess she did say the word.  The word.  What, 80 years ago or something?  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  But I just hate her.  Sometimes you can just look at someone, and you know you hate them.  Paula Dane is one of those people.  Paula Dane.  She's got it in her face.  Yeah.  She's got a hateable face.  Absolutely.  Hateable face.  How's the curse?  I'm trying to curse less.  Is it good?  So far so good?  Mm-hmm.  It's going to take a few days.  I'm attempting to curse less.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I think I've already had four or five bombs.  I'm going to give it a whirl.  As I sit here going, you're going to curse less. 
[00:08:30]  I had noticed I've done at least four or five, right?  You know what it is?  In regular conversation, you just throw an F in there as you're thinking about the next  thing you're trying to say.  Right.  Yeah.  I'll tell you why.  Because it's a filler.  I hang around with a lot of kids and normal parents and stuff, and I see it on their face.  Yeah.  Their eyes get really big, and I'm like, what?  Oh, are they horrified?  The F word.  The F word.  Oh.  There's a whole bunch of kids here.  Yeah.  They just don't realize.  Yeah.  But I don't care if my kid curses. 
[00:09:00]  He'll hear it at some point.  I don't care if he curses.  I don't.  Yeah.  I care about all their crap, but not that.  So what did Paula Dane say?  Well, she said, I feel like I'm battled or disgraced.  Will always follow my name, she tells people.  Oh, shut up.  It's like that black football player who recently came out.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  He said, I just want to be known as a football player.  I don't want to be known as a gay football player. 
[00:09:30]  I know exactly what he's saying.  Uh-huh.  But she just before that said that black football player.  So what's the problem, though?  So she wants to be known as just an extremely unhealthy cook?  Yeah.  Yeah, not a disgraced obese woman, just an obese woman.  Right.  That is ridiculous that she would even be in trouble for that, though.  Because who's mad at what for that statement?  I think it's just the absurdity that she...  No one's really mad.  It's just like, I think it just shows that she's just a dummy with words. 
[00:10:00]  She's just a dummy with words.  Because in one sentence, she says, I understand him not wanting to be known as a gay football player.  Uh-huh.  And two sentences before that, she said, that black football player.  Right.  Which is the same premise.  She continues, I feel like embattled or disgraced will always follow my name.  Yeah.  Oh, shut up.  Poor woman.  It's like that black football player who recently came out, Dean said in a People magazine cover story,  which hits newsstands on Friday, he said, I just... 
[00:10:30]  He said?  He said, I just want to be...  Oh, okay.  He said, I just want to be known as a football player.  I don't want to be known as a gay football player.  I know exactly what he's saying.  Do you?  Do you really?  I'm fighting to get my name back.  Ugh.  Oh, yeah.  In other words, Dean does not like being labeled a racist for a slur she swore she used a very long time ago.  Which, you know, she probably shouldn't be.  We've been through that story before.  She, you know, did a lot for the black community and whatnot.  And she's lying.  Yeah.  She used a slur many, a very long time ago. 
[00:11:00]  I guarantee she used a word within the last couple of years.  I bet.  Everyone does.  Yeah.  Everyone does.  It's been used.  By everybody.  Everyone.  Everybody.  Even you, Sean Hannity.  I bet.  He said no.  I haven't forgotten.  He said no.  He says he's never thought the word or said the word.  Never even thought it.  You're just another liar.  Never even thought it.  I guess it would be bad for business if he admitted that.  But the fact is he absolutely has either used the word or has thought it. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Because we even called him out.  We go, not even thought the word?  No.  So even when we said you've never thought the word, he was thinking the word.  He never.  No, no.  It never entered his head.  No, but if we're bringing it up, then at that point it pops in your head.  It has to pop in your head.  My mom used to talk about that shit with the, ah, another curse.  See?  Oh.  With the Catholic school.  Yeah.  She said, you know, it was a sin to think about sex.  Right.  And the nuns would tell you that. 
[00:12:00]  If you think about sex, you're going to hell.  But then.  And my mom said, as a young person, as soon as they said that, the first thing you're  thinking about is sex.  And then all of a sudden you've got that Catholic guilt all of a sudden.  You're not supposed to be thinking about it.  But then they reminded you of it.  Of course.  That's the first thing that pops in your head then when the nun is saying that.  The bitches.  The bitches that are bitches.  The bitches that are bitches.  You think Paula Deen is going to cry on the Today Show again?  I didn't mean to call him a black football player.  I'm a black football player.  I just hate her.  Well, she's a big dope. 
[00:12:30]  She's extremely hateable.  Because she's just full of lies.  She's just full of lies and butter.  Lies and buttery lies.  I would bet strongly she doesn't Nutribullet every morning.  Oh, no.  No, of course not.  It's a pretty bright green today.  I'm not acknowledging my Nutribullet until I get a little envelope filled with some tender.  It's like you're cursing.  Some tender.  You just mentioned the brand twice.  One sentence.  I'm just letting them know I'm still out here.  Crazy.  I'm still out here. 
[00:13:00]  I'll give them a little taste.  Oh, God.  You know how many I would sell today if I just told them what was in this thing?  I really want to know, too.  Because it's very bright green.  Yeah.  Oh, you should see.  Vivid.  You should see what the duties look like this morning.  Oh, God.  Nuclear.  Are they green?  Oh, boy.  I don't think I need any more greens in my diet.  Really?  Yeah.  If your poo comes out green, I think you're doing pretty good.  Oh, God.  I think you're doing all right.  Everybody's still curious about the boost, you know? 
[00:13:30]  I got two boosts in here.  I see some oatmeal.  I'm not saying.  Maybe I went with another boost.  I see it in there.  You won't confirm that?  Maybe it's a chia.  Maybe it's some chia.  Is that what it's?  Yeah, chia seeds?  Superfoods?  Chia seeds are superfoods.  Know why?  Why?  Because they expand.  What that makes it a superfood?  Well, you shove that.  You shove.  I was ready to say the S-word there.  Good.  You shove it down, and then it expands, and it makes you feel fuller. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, and you don't eat as much of the crapola.  Can't you?  Why are you trying to curse less?  Is it self-improvement?  I'm trying to bring the show to the next level.  Okay.  I have a feeling that people don't play our clips out there because they can't.  We say some very clever and intelligent things, but when the other word is the F-word or the S-word,  it makes it very tough to be, you know.  To enjoy a good F-bomb.  It's content, too. 
[00:14:30]  I was thinking about that, like the Ted Lange interview.  Oh, yeah.  The quote that I would get out to the media is that he referenced doing the finger-pointing thing,  and fingering chicks.  Right.  Well, that's true.  But there's not that many news stories about sitcom stars fingering chicks.  Not really.  TMZ could have ran with that one.  You think so?  Yeah, they could have.  Easily.  I got...  People don't really understand to this day, I think.  Like, I had...  I was all in to beat the crap out of Ted Lange.  Oh, man.  You started.  Yes. 
[00:15:00]  You said do it as soon as he came in.  And I was...  I started right off the bat.  Right.  But this is how we've changed over the years.  If the guy turns out to be cool, then we gotta fuck...  Yeah.  Then we gotta back off.  Because you're gonna look like a fucking asshole if you just start beating him up.  The old days, we would still be all in.  Yeah.  And I'm fine with that, because that was the past, and that's what we used to do.  But if the guy's gonna be cool, and then it turns out we had a lot of fun with the guy...  Yeah.  Then so be it.  Yeah.  So in the old days, you wouldn't allow a recovery.  Like, you'd get in your head, we're going to beat this guy up, and no matter what he did, 
[00:15:30]  he was getting a beating?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Even if they didn't deserve it.  Right.  Yeah.  But it made for great radio, so who cares?  Exactly.  Uh...  Ugh, this stupid thing.  Thank you, Tom.  I read this this morning, too.  Tom in Cleveland.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Is it cold up there, Tom?  Uh, yeah.  It's, uh, sub-zero, so...  Ooh, yeah.  I don't get it.  I don't...  Is this part of the global warming thing? 
[00:16:00]  Uh, climate change, they call it now, because the global warming thing didn't work out because  it gets cold.  Well, that tricked everybody, right?  Yeah, it tricked everyone.  The climate change.  So now it's climate change.  I believe in climate change.  Do you?  Absolutely.  I believe in it, too, that, uh, over time, climates change.  But not within our lifetime.  Eh, maybe.  I don't know.  I think if you're a bunch of generations, okay.  But not within our lifetime.  There's been horrendous fucking weather changes.  Oh, there, I used it, too.  There's been horrendous weather changes.  But when I was growing up on Long Island, every winter, we could go ice skating. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  And until this winter, we couldn't go ice skating anymore.  Yeah.  So what's that about?  I don't know.  I think it's cyclical.  It didn't get cold enough.  But within our lifetime, I don't know.  I think it takes more than that for the cycle to turn around.  Yeah.  Well, I don't mean a major cycle change like, uh, like, uh, the ice age or something.  But I'm talking, there is a cyclical thing where it'll get warmer over a few years,  and then it'll start getting cold again, and then warmer. 
[00:17:00]  Why are the icebergs?  Why are the icebergs melting all of a sudden?  Are they?  Mm-hmm.  What happened to the icebergs?  The polar bears are trapped.  Poor little guys.  They don't know what to do.  They're in the middle of the water.  They're stuck.  They're stuck on, like, little ice things floating around.  You've got to assume people pumping, uh, you know, all kinds of shit in the air.  It probably does something.  I think so.  I would think it does something.  I just don't know how detrimental it is to the world.  All you have to do is drive around Manhattan after a nice snow. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  A snowstorm a couple days later, and you see how everything turns completely black?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  It's happening all the time, but you only notice it after...  When it snows.  ...when it snows and a few days after the snow.  Yeah, that's true.  But on a beautiful summer day, that same stuff is turning everything around to kind of black.  Yeah, yeah.  That can't be good.  Can't be.  City after city after city after city.  Town after town.  Yeah.  After cities, it's everywhere.  You know what, though? 
[00:18:00]  When you get one volcano that erupts, it pumps more garbage into the air than people do over the course of years.  So I think these natural occurrences of pollution, whatever you want to call it, does a lot more damage than people do.  You get that from your boy, Bill O'Reilly?  That's my boy.  So what do you got, Tom?  All right.  So, Opie, I heard you on CNN.com early this morning, and I was wondering if you caught that story about there's a school in California that's going to ban students from wearing American flag shirts on Cinco de Mayo. 
[00:18:30]  You know what?  What's going on with that?  I'm going to still use the word pussy.  I don't want to say fuck as much, but I got to say pussy.  You got to.  We're a nation of pussies, period.  Yeah, they're trying to say it's for the safety of the students.  I mean, they're in freedom now.  Like, what is that?  I remember going to school.  I can't think of anything that actually bothered me. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Except for maybe, you know, kids that were just jerks.  Uh-huh.  But all this stuff.  And with my kid in school now, I don't care what flag he sees.  I don't care.  Yeah, who cares?  I'll explain everything to him when we're in the car driving to Philly or whatever.  When we have those long car rides, we'll talk about stuff.  I don't care.  Why are people offended if they see an American flag in a school?  In America.  Who's offended by that?  What are they, are they assuming that some Mexican kids are going to beat up the American 
[00:19:30]  kids because they're wearing an American flag?  I guess last year there was some kind of issue with pacing or something for kids wearing their  American flag shirts and they were sent home and it went to one of the local courts or the  state courts or something.  And they said it was within the school rights to ban kids from where.  So they're just trying to keep the problems down.  Yeah.  But that's usually, but that's always the excuse and then it turns into other things.  Like you know that the NFL, they want to ban the N-word and it'll be a 15-yard penalty. 
[00:20:00]  Some players are against it, by the way.  They're like, look man, sometimes stuff just comes out.  Yeah.  When you're battling like we do.  But now, and this is exactly why we tell everyone you got to fight, you got to fight  this stuff no matter what.  Every time.  Now they're throwing the F-word into it.  Which is the gay F-word, not the one we're trying to use less here on the show.  We should say, you know.  Yes.  They want to ban faggot now.  Yeah.  So then they'll get those two words banned and then they'll just, they'll continue moving 
[00:20:30]  on.  Because every group will go, well, what about our hurtful word?  Our hurtful word.  Our hurtful word like us.  We have a hurtful word too, you know.  The R-word.  Right.  I'm sure they're like, well, you play retarded.  Right.  And then all of a sudden, you know, you get penalty.  But then another group, what about our hurtful word?  We have a hurtful word too.  Yeah.  All right, guys, I got to punch out.  Take it easy.  Well, we were riffing with you.  What happened?  What's wrong with you, Tom?  We were riffing.  Yeah, I got to clock in.  You were like Jim Norton for a minute there. 
[00:21:00]  You going to bail on that?  Third mic.  It's a big spot for you.  You cheese out on us.  All right.  All right.  That's why you got to fight all this.  That's why I'm in disagreement with Jimmy and the Redskins thing.  Yeah.  I mean, we've both talked about our sides on the thing.  But in the end, I think you just got to fight it.  You do.  Because they're just going to continue.  They're going to just continue.  They'll keep pounding you on this thing.  There's a couple of instances in the news today also about that.  And I guess political correctness.  Katy Perry took something out of her video. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, because it was a Muslim thing?  It was like a Muslim thing.  Some guy's wearing a Muslim symbol and then gets hit by lightning in the video.  Well, why did she do that?  Oh, they cut that out.  Oh.  But why did she do that?  Because she hates Muslims.  Oh, okay.  And Katy Perry hates Muslims.  Look how little it is, too.  It's like nothing.  It's this little thing here.  Right.  But why was the Muslim getting hit by lightning?  I don't know.  It didn't even look like lightning.  It looks like a force thing.  It looks like Darth Vader's getting them with some of that force light lightning stuff. 
[00:22:00]  What's the...  I don't understand the background of this.  I don't know what the video is.  It's just like...  I think because he's just wearing a bunch of gold chains and shit, one of them happens  to be an Allah pendant.  Okay.  Yeah.  And they just took that one tiny little pendant out.  All right.  But why does that guy have to be hit by lightning?  I don't know.  I guess it's part of the story.  Yep.  So that's offending Muslims?  It's very offensive.  Everyone is offended.  It's like Egyptian. 
[00:22:30]  Egyptian.  That's just part of the look.  Egyptian!  How's her boobs look?  Yeah, how does she look?  Who cares about everything else?  How does her boobs look in this video?  How does she?  Very round.  Oh.  Oh, I see what's going on here.  She's walking like an Egyptian.  Oh, shit.  See, that's why we're still doing this together.  Oh.  Got a little Egyptian thing, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  Wow, she's beautiful.  She's like Cleopatra.  Oh, look.  They spray-painted her hair.  Sam, would you pop her in the shitter?  Oh, wow.  I think she's a little annoying, but not so annoying I wouldn't pop her shitter open.  But Lady Gaga isn't annoying?  No, you're right.  She's annoying.  Yeah.  They all are really bad.  Lady Gaga is gross.  She looks good with the darker hair in this video more than...  I like her in the Cleopatra get-up.  I love this video.  That guy's wearing a wrestling belt.  When does Rob Bartlett make his appearance? 
[00:23:30]  It's the Egyptian coach.  Yeah.  Right.  Not enough tip.  Whatever.  Sorry.  I'm done.  Not enough tip.  I'm done.  So she took that out.  Oh, there's the part.  There it was.  That was it.  Go back.  Yeah.  That's the part we were waiting for.  That was it.  So here's the lightning.  So see this here?  Uh-huh.  Like at the very bottom of the screen?  Yeah.  That was...  It was.  An a la pendant.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  But how could anybody even notice that from the beginning?  No one.  And who complained?  I don't know if anybody actually complained.  Maybe they just got scared.  Oh, before anybody gets offended, we should...  But is that guy a Muslim?  It was never established.  Oh, yeah.  He's probably a real Muslim.  You think?  So if he was cool with it, then who cares?  Probably.  He gets hit by some kind of lightning stuff and then turns to sand.  Right.  That's what happens to him.  Well, that happens a lot in Egypt.  Oh, yeah.  That's why they have so much sand.  All the time.  Yes.  Yeah.  They used to be people.  That's exactly true.  Yeah.  You didn't know that? 
[00:24:30]  No.  They were all men.  They were all men.  They were all men.  They were all men.  They were all men.  Chains and wrestling belts.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Mike in Virginia.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  You should look up.  Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Redskins, his response to that cut Democrat.  I'm out.  Wait.  What happened?  What?  Mike, you tell us.  I don't know.  He makes us.  He calls up and then makes us have to do research.  What?  What happened?  You're supposed to tell us. 
[00:25:00]  Callers are half-assed today.  Players Union talking to NFL about ban on infamous gay slur alongside N-Word.  Yeah, we did that.  That is F-Word.  Yes.  I don't want that.  What happened?  Mike, you tell us.  I don't know this story.  I did a Google News for Daniel Snyder, and the most recent thing is February 4th.  Oh, okay.  Come on.  Come on.  Old news, as they say.  That's old hat.  That's exactly right.  You got your food, so we should take an early break because we have Jim Ross coming in today. 
[00:25:30]  My God.  My God.  Come on.  You talk to him already, right?  Yeah.  He seems very excited to do our show.  He's got a real...  I told him you guys love Vince McMahon stories.  Oh, do we love a good Vince story.  And he's got a real good one.  Oh, nice.  Oh, he's here at 15 or 7.30.  You got two different times.  7.30.  7.30?  7.30.  Oh, well, he does have his food anyway, so we can still eat.  All right.  All right, so we got Jim Ross coming in in about a half hour, and he's got a good Vince story. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he told me on Wednesday.  Oh.  I think he'll enjoy it.  What is he promoting?  He's got a podcast.  He's got a live show in New York.  Who doesn't have a podcast?  Everyone's got one now.  The wrestlers are all jumping on board.  They all think they can do this.  It's easy.  They're all jumping on board like the comedians did.  Yeah.  Like, all the old wrestlers have pod, Stone Cold and Jericho and Jim Ross.  I've heard from a bunch of these people in the last year.  Like, oh, man.  They respect us a lot more. 
[00:26:30]  Let's just put it that way.  And they're only doing like an hour a week.  I'm like, you're only doing an hour.  Yeah.  We can do that in our sleep.  We already did our podcast for this week.  Podcast done.  Podcast done.  I'm like, man, I don't realize how hard it is.  I'm like, hard?  We do four hours a day.  You do one hour a week.  Plus, they're talking to different people all the time.  It seems so easy.  Right.  And they're all just following the same dumb formula, just interviewing a comic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Interviewing a comic.  That idea was done already.  So if you're doing a podcast, do something different. 
[00:27:00]  Yep.  It's been perfected.  But I hear from them.  They're like, oh, man, new respect.  I'm like, thank you.  Respect.  Not as easy as you thought, huh?  No.  That's right.  So he has a podcast.  He's got a podcast.  So what the hell does he do with his podcast?  He talks to, he talks wrestling, you know.  He talks to, he's Stone Cold was his first guest.  Yawn!  Stone Cold.  Ha ha ha.  I would listen to a Stone Cold in Jim Ross.  Stone Cold.  Is he coming back to the WWE? 
[00:27:30]  Um, no.  He's coming back and doing stuff for like the network a little bit here and there.  But, he's not, he's not.  They're done with him?  Yeah.  When Vince is done with you, he's done with you, too.  Damn.  Although Hulk, he came back.  Hulk's back.  Jim Ross has a lot of good stories, though, because he was also head of the talent.  So he had to deal with everyone.  I know.  He probably has a lot of great stories about the people.  So he hired a lot of these guys, huh?  Yeah.  From like Mick Foley to like 10 years after that.  Wow.  Okay.  I'm looking forward to talking to him. 
[00:28:00]  I hear he's a great guy.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So we'll be back with some other stuff.  And then Jim Ross.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Dr. Steve from Weird Medicine with another Dr. Steve Medical Minute.  Hello, Dr. Steve.  This is Bob from Pennsylvania.  And I take sleeping pills.  Some friends of mine have told me that they're going to kill me.  And I want to know if this is bunk or if there's something to it.  If I need to stop taking these things, please let me know.  Although there are studies showing that alcohol increases the risk of death in people who are taking sleeping pills. 
[00:28:30]  So don't do that.  I think what you're referring to is a recent article in the online version of the British Medical Journal that matched a group of people who take sleeping pills on a regular basis with a group of people who don't.  And the conclusion they drew were pretty frightening.  The group that took even just a few sleeping pills a year had a fourfold increase in death.  The groups that took more sleeping pills a year had an even higher death rate. 
[00:29:00]  Now, the problem with this study is that no single cause of death was identified.  In addition, doing a placebo study that might answer this question, and the study might increase participants' death fourfold, would probably be unethical.  If there's any good news in this, of the 35,000 people who were in the study, there were only 638 deaths that were attributed to the sleeping pill group and approximately 240 in the group that weren't taking sleeping pills. 
[00:29:30]  So the absolute risk of death still remains low.  Everyone who is taking sleeping pills on a regular basis should talk to their doctor about whether there are other options for them.  Interestingly, the sleep aid melatonin and the prescription medication Rosarum were not included in this study because they're not, quote-unquote, hypnotic agents,  and they might be a worthy replacement for insomniacs who get boned by this study.  Be sure to check out Weird Medicine Saturdays at 10 p.m. Eastern, right here on the Opian Anthony Channel. 
[00:30:00]  Good.  The Opian Anthony Show is back on Sirius XM.  Oh, nice.  It's been a long time.  U2 released War 31 years ago.  Seems like there's always a U2 thing in history, huh?  Well, they've been around for a while. 
[00:30:30]  Yes, they have.  Since the late 70s, I believe, right?  That's weird when you, like, think of a band from the 80s and you realize they were around in the 70s also.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  They're the last ones.  As far as bands still coming out with original music, rock bands.  Name another band.  Yeah.  What else you got?  That goes back to the late 70s.  Yeah.  Name one.  Asia just came out with a song called Valkyrie. 
[00:31:00]  That's the only reason I brought it up.  Valkyrie.  Valkyrie.  Valkyrie.  That is not a good song.  Kind of mad at Classic Rewind right now.  Why?  Not enough Asia.  Not enough Asia?  I pop that channel on every day as I drive my young son to school.  That's my choice for the bathroom.  I like it.  When you're going to shave, shower, things like that.  I put that on, too.  It brings me back to one of my home of rock and rolls.  Ah.  I believe it would be 96 WCMF, Rochester's home of rock and roll. 
[00:31:30]  Ah.  It's all the stuff I used to play up there on Classic Rewind.  Good stuff.  It is pretty good stuff.  I was listening to Robert Plant, Now and Zen.  Oh, wow.  Remember that?  I certainly do.  Lighten Up, Baby.  Lighten Up.  Lighten Up.  Lighten Up.  And then he just threw a whole bunch of Led Zeppelin songs into a Nutribullet at the end of that song.  Yes.  Just mushed them together. 
[00:32:00]  Hey, hey, Mom.  Bam, bam, bam.  Do we have that?  Lighten Up.  Lighten Up.  I liked it, though.  Yeah.  Robert Plant, Now and Zen.  Come on, Sam.  I'm getting it.  Jesus.  What's wrong with you?  Can't wait for you to say, oh, well, this isn't cool either.  This sucks.  This sucks, too.  This sucks.  I bet it sucks.  There's no Jay-Z in it.  This sucks.  Is that the whole album?  I just want...  What's the name of the... 
[00:32:30]  Oh, Heaven Knows was off that album, too.  Heaven Knows.  Oh, yeah.  Take an eye for an eye.  Hey.  Ship of Fools was on that, too?  Oh, my goodness.  He had a real hit with that one.  What was the one with...  Give me the track list.  I'll tell you in two seconds.  It wasn't cool.  Tall, cool one.  Tall, cool one.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Of course it's Kevin.  From Connecticut.  God, fucking brown noser. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Jesus.  Fucking gay.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Rockin'.  Is this okay, Sam?  Is this okay for you?  So far, no.  Why?  It looks very deep.  He was still doing the Zeppelin thing.  Definitely had a Zeppelin feel to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can just go to the end.  Everyone knows how great this song is.  We just want to.  Oh, my God.  This was, uh, there's the Hey, Mama.  Hey, Hey, Mama.  Damn.  You heard it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's your, uh, there's your Led Zeppelin neutral bullet. 
[00:34:00]  It's like, yeah, we, we got it.  You were in Led Zeppelin.  He was nervous.  I don't think he was, I don't think he was, I don't think he was, I don't think he had confidence  in that song.  Yeah.  No, I don't think so. 
[00:34:30]  He goes, but if I throw a little Zeppelin stuff in, then people go, Hey man, Robert Plant's  doing some Zeppelin thing in his new song.  You got to check it out.  You got to check it out.  Yeah.  All right.  There's our music break for today.  I hope you enjoyed it.  It always seems like the second break every day is a little, little music break for everybody.  I don't know.  Cause we come back to music and then we start talking about it.  Yeah.  Classic Rewind.  Where's the Asia?  I don't think they care.  Dissing the first super group Asia like that.  What's wrong with you?  Fucking, uh, I don't think they care about the fucking Asia. 
[00:35:00]  Valkyrie, Valkyrie, Jim Ross will be here in a few minutes.  People want us to weigh Roland and E-Rock.  They want a surprise weigh-in.  Wow.  Should we do it?  Yes.  Cause Dr. Ian Smith is now done.  Now they're on their own.  You're going to do it right now?  Yes.  All right.  Let me go get them.  That is true.  They had the big, uh, you know, big competition at, uh, the big, uh, weight loss competition.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  With Dr. Ian Smith.  I don't think we'll ever hear from Dr. Ian Smith again.  I think he's had it with us.  I think he probably is, uh, thinking, why do I go on that show to just be abused?  Should I call him?  Oh, man.  What if he heard the last break about the blenders that we did the other day?  What would I do?  Well, you weren't really very...  I'm not getting envelopes from him.  That's true.  It's all about the envelopes in this business.  Saying that his blender was like the old lady blender.  Mom's old blender on the counter. 
[00:36:00]  I'll ask him.  I'll ask him if you could screw that, uh, you know, the blades off.  I heard you had a, you, you got a NutriBullet, huh?  Yes, I did.  Uh, Roland was very excited to present me with a NutriBullet.  Nice.  Who is this guy?  He's got a different look every time you see him.  Now you're, I thought you just shaved, now you're growing it back?  Yeah, I'm gonna probably grow it back.  And, and you got like the, uh, your haircut or something.  Yeah, yeah, really short.  Real short.  And you got the geek glasses on.  Yes.  Yes.  You look like an ad man. 
[00:36:30]  Yes, an ad man.  An ad man.  Ah.  Irak was not happy in the office.  Why?  When you heard about the surprise Wayne, he goes, oh, go go fuck yourself.  Oh, shit.  I don't know, but I think it's a great idea.  We're supporting him.  I know.  Maybe he, well.  Because this is, this is what happens with diets.  You know, the diet ends and then do you go back to just eating shitty or do you continue  to try to, you know, eat right?  Roland has brought donuts in the past two days.  Oh.  Oh, these guys are just, oh, donuts are not good. 
[00:37:00]  There's no way you can make a donut good for a diet.  You can throw that in a NutriBullet.  Ah.  Did you, uh, go with the leafy greens in your NutriBullet?  No, I didn't.  Just, uh, it was a fruit smoothie.  It was wonderful.  Fruit smoothie?  A little yogurt.  Some fucking strawberries.  Did you put vanilla ice cream in it while you were at it?  Bananas.  No vanilla ice cream, but.  Every once in a while, I'll treat myself with my NutriBullet and I'll, I'll make my  own homemade fribble. 
[00:37:30]  Wow.  A little vanilla ice cream, fresh strawberries, and you add a little whole milk to it.  Oh.  And a banana.  And you gotta put the banana in it.  It's delicious.  That banana really makes things taste great.  That's right.  Why are you mad about the surprise weigh-in?  Because we're still supporting it.  Because we're still supporting it.  Who gives a shit to millions and millions of people?  Do you understand this is your chance to tell everyone to go fuck themselves?  You get on the scale and you're continuing to lose weight.  That's, that's a big F you to everybody that wants you to fail.  But I had a celebratory dinner. 
[00:38:00]  And a celebratory dessert.  For what reason?  What?  What do you celebrate?  I lost 20 pounds, man.  24.  Oh yeah.  And then, and then.  You can't celebrate the fact that you lost 24 pounds by having a celebratory dinner.  Roland bought boxes of donuts and hot chocolate for everyone yesterday.  I had a celebratory.  Do you have any?  No.  I'm asking Eric.  I tried a piece of what the, the blueberry. 
[00:38:30]  It was.  But, I have to say that Dominic has a new dessert.  It was delicious.  With the plugging of the chefs.  Is that the one they have on the news?  That's the Cronut guy.  Yeah.  I saw the news and all I was thinking is Roland going like, ooh.  New dessert.  I didn't say woo.  I was there.  Oh.  What is it?  It's like, it's a milk and honey Cronut.  Isn't your whole diet that you can eat whatever you want as long as it's not grains or sugar?  Right.  And isn't the Cronut literally just grains and sugar? 
[00:39:00]  If you clean your ears, you ass, I said it was a celebratory.  Oh, shit.  That's my mistake.  You forgot the celebratory.  Yeah.  It's like a Roland celebratory month.  Let's do a quick weigh-in.  You guys have been off to Dr. Ian Smith and the Vinnie Testeverity.  Vinnie Testeverity.  I don't think he likes me anymore.  Vinnie?  What?  No.  No.  Dr. Ian.  Oh, Dr. Ian?  No.  I don't think he likes you at all.  You don't have to think at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no way he likes you.  He just doesn't like you.  Oh, well.  Nutra Bullet.  Boo.  What's up, Nutra Bullet? 
[00:39:30]  So, let's do a quick weigh-in.  I'll let Eric go first, because my celebratories were bad.  What are you doing?  You lost 24 pounds.  I know.  You're well on your way.  Yeah, I went downhill.  What are you going to do?  Oh, no.  I went the Chris Christie weigh-in, boys.  Yeah, Eric.  What?  You haven't eaten well either since last week?  No, I have.  I had one celebratory last weekend that the official diet run was over.  But other than that, I've still been on my... 
[00:40:00]  What did you eat because the diet was over?  I had pizza.  I was just dying.  Oh, good old pizza.  But this is why I think most diets do suck, because you've got to learn how to eat in a  way that you're not going to suffer.  Right.  And these diets make you suffer, and then you lose the weight, and you're like, I can't  suffer anymore, so you're back to pizza and whatever else.  And I don't blame anyone.  No.  They don't teach you the right way.  Or two weeks diet, one day celebratory, then another two weeks diet, then celebratory.  He likes celebratory.  I think it's an extremely slow process to turn your eating around, and you've got to 
[00:40:30]  find stuff that tastes good, that's healthy, which takes a while.  But to jump on a diet, you're eventually going to go back to your old ways.  It's expensive, too.  You get the fish, the this and that.  Dude, you know what it says, poor toy dinner with steak and lobster with butter sauce.  All right, get on the scale.  Come on.  He's setting up for something.  Why can't you celebrate with Brussels sprouts?  With bacon?  Oh, with pancetta.  A little pancetta, butter.  I mean, I had some Brussels sprouts with pancetta. 
[00:41:00]  You did?  With bacon and cheddar?  Yeah, but you know, with pancetta, with some oil and onions.  I hate Brussels sprouts.  Tastes like a little lettuce of bacon.  It's delicious.  It's like bacon to everybody.  Brussels sprouts eat a dick.  You're not a big fan of the Brussels sprouts.  Try it with pancetta.  No, man.  It changes your mind.  People have cooked them many different ways.  I just can't get into it.  Go ahead, Eric.  Let's do this.  Come on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Eric, I'll zip your sweatshirt. 
[00:41:30]  Why?  You didn't have a sweatshirt on?  Oh, oh.  Okay, never mind.  What?  I just know what he's wearing.  Oh.  I saw it.  What?  What?  He has a surprise t-shirt on?  For who?  He's always got mystery.  For Jim Ross?  A little mystery.  Uh-oh.  What do we got?  Iraq just stepped on the scale.  Oh, Sam's laughing.  Sam is, of course, chuckling.  That's Sam.  I mean, why do you have a surprise t-shirt on?  It's not a surprise t-shirt. 
[00:42:00]  And is it going to be a big reveal later?  No.  A big reveal.  Then why is he zipping up?  Because he's all about mystery and intrigue.  He is about mystery and intrigue.  So, who's the surprise t-shirt for?  It's for you guys.  It's for me.  It's not a surprise t-shirt.  It's my new favorite thing.  And I know Anthony's going to criticize it, like he does with the Simpsons shirts, with  the Doctor Who shirts.  No.  So, I have a new thing, and I'm just preventing that from zapping right now.  I know what it is, anyway.  Do you really?  Yeah.  What is it? 
[00:42:30]  It's Scott.  A Todd.  Oh, jeez.  He's got a Todd in the morning shirt.  How'd you get a Todd in the morning shirt?  You have to see the van.  Oh, my God.  He's wearing a Todd shirt.  I got a hat.  Why is he going with pink?  That is really...  Everything about the imaging, the logos, the website.  They're going after the chicks.  They're going after the women.  It's too pink to be for female.  Like, it looks really... 
[00:43:00]  Stupid.  Oh, fuck.  Homosexual.  Homos is a very bad word to use.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't say homosexual.  Listen.  Homos.  It's an H-word.  Mysterious.  What's E-Rock's weight a week later, after Dr. Ian Smith has gone away?  Six weeks ago, E-Rock weighed 247 pounds.  247.  Five weeks went by.  E-Rock lost 11 pounds, down to 236, losing 4.5%.  That was a week ago.  He was at 236.  Now off the diet for a week.  Where is he at?  After seven days, he has lost... 
[00:43:30]  I mean, gained one pound.  No.  But that fluctuates.  Yeah.  It fluctuates.  So he's 237.  But you...  There's a pound.  That was pizza.  That was the pizza.  Pizza will put a pound on you pretty quick.  Yeah.  I'm maintaining.  Yeah, but don't you want to keep losing?  I do.  You're not in the maintaining stage yet.  Yeah.  I just jumped right to it.  I've hit my ideal weight.  You're not maintaining yet.  You're supposed to still be losing.  You're supposed to keep losing.  That 237 should be... 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  Whatever.  170?  Huh?  Realistic goals here.  Realistic goals.  Right.  That's good.  All right.  And now, Roland, please.  A week after going off the Vinny Testarati diet.  Is that it?  Now, you guys are kind of on your own.  Oh, boy.  Give me all the numbers.  What was Roland's starting weight?  Roland's starting weight six weeks ago was 337.  Yeah.  In five weeks, he lost 24 pounds down to 313. 
[00:44:30]  That's sweet, man.  Yeah.  In one week...  Now that he's off the diet for a week, technically.  Off the...  Yeah.  I mean, he didn't have to be off the diet.  Right.  But, you know, he thought he wasn't getting watched anymore.  Uh-huh.  He's gained five pounds in the last week.  Is that maintaining?  Yeah, because it's still in that 20-pound zone.  So, I was like, hey, I lost 20 pounds.  20-pound zone?  What's the 20-pound zone?  Well, people say, how much have you lost?  I go, 20 pounds.  They're like, wow, congratulations.  So, that's all I...  He's still crediting himself. 
[00:45:00]  You've probably given five back in a week.  I might throw this up at Tory dinner tonight.  Wow.  The only thing is, is why am I water weight, they say.  Yeah.  You've gained five.  Eric's gained one.  Water weight gain, you think?  Yeah.  I have to be gained.  Let's say hi to Nathan in Texas.  Nathan.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Dan, Nate.  How y'all doing?  All right, buddy.  Hey, listen, I'm a truck driver, and I constantly, constantly have to battle with my own weight,  maintaining it, losing it.  If you're trying to lose weight or anything, the important thing is, you lose a pound, you 
[00:45:30]  should be happy about it.  Because that's a pound you didn't gain, you know?  Yeah.  It's hard as hell to lose.  I mean, I'm 273 right now, and I feel fat as shit.  Well, I think A-Rock could easily continue losing weight.  All he had to do is show a little discipline.  Yeah, I'm not going to explain it.  Yeah, I mean, my main thing is, I don't want him to be down just because everyone's ragging  on him, because he didn't lose enough weight.  He lost some weight, and that's important. 
[00:46:00]  He lost 10 pounds in six weeks, and he's already starting to gain weight back.  I was ugly 10 pounds.  Well, I mean, I take a piss, and I'll go back to 11 pounds.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I take a shit, I'll go back to 24 pounds.  Oh, fuck.  Five pounds.  Shit.  Hey, I recently discovered y'all's show.  I've never listened to it in my life, and since I discovered...  There was another incident this week where Roland was in the bathroom, and I knew he was in  there, because he's been gone for a while, and I went in, and it did not smell that well, 
[00:46:30]  and as I was leaving, another guy walked in, and I just heard as the door shut, it was  that bad, because it was him.  Very fragrant.  What was going on that day, Roland?  I was shaking some death.  All right, well, they're doing all right, I guess.  I love the Nutribullet.  It's amazing.  I don't like the surprise wagons, so we should back off of those. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, after the breakfast, he just doused in Chipotle hot sauce.  Oh.  What did you have for breakfast, Roland?  What did you have?  I had my eggs, my eggs, bacon, and cheese.  Which is on the diet.  Yeah, but that was to balance on my cronut steak.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that was celebratory.  There was a big, creamy iced coffee that he's drinking.  Big, creamy iced coffee.  It's delicious.  I know it's all delicious. 
[00:47:30]  That's the decision.  That is.  That's the bad thing.  Right.  It's so delicious.  You've got to stay away.  I suffered for six weeks, and I need a little treat.  I think he speaks for a lot of people.  That's why this is great.  Yeah, like, I mean, like, Tim goes, reward.  I'm like, all right, I'll reward myself.  Do we have any Todd news?  Not yet.  I monitored yesterday and today.  It's already showing signs that they're not liking the direction it's going.  What?  Uh-oh. 
[00:48:00]  Why?  Because he was, when he started the first show, he's just a lot of introductions over and over,  so people knew who everyone was.  Yeah.  And then he was doing a lot longer talk breaks than he was doing on Scott and Todd.  Right.  Now there's a few more songs being played in the hour.  Yeah.  The talk breaks are a little bit shorter.  Oh, tighten them up.  Tighten them up.  And there's not as many phone scams.  Oh, no.  And yesterday and today.  I hope we're programming a show for him.  I think we are.  That was rule.  At this point, I think we're programming. 
[00:48:30]  Yesterday.  The listeners are.  Yesterday and today, his key thing is they do a big, you know, ID sounder thing at the  start of the show, and then it goes into one of his parody songs.  Well, there was none yesterday, and there's none today.  Oh, good.  But he has to have some kind of Friday bit.  Be on the lookout for some dumb Friday story.  I believe there's a phone scam going on right now.  Oh, as we speak.  And don't forget about Scott.  Yes, it's already set and ready to go.  Starts his solo show Monday.  I can't wait to hear what that sounds like.  CBS FM, if you want to play along.  CBS FM!  I tried and tried to do Mystery Guest today. 
[00:49:00]  I was trying to get Scott on the phone, because he's doing a lot of promotion to promote this  gig.  No, huh?  And I have yet to hear back from anybody from CBS FM.  All right.  Know what that means?  The Iraq name doesn't carry any weight.  All right.  I don't have Scott's personal info.  I'm sure if he got the name.  He didn't acknowledge us.  I loved it up there.  He didn't acknowledge that you called?  I don't think it's Scott.  I think it's CBS FM not telling Scott, because I think Scott would come on.  Yeah.  We're going to make it hurt even more Monday now. 
[00:49:30]  I mean, Scott did Howard's thing.  I should have at least acknowledged.  He would come on with us.  You think he's going to...  Scott did what?  Scott did a news piece for Howard's news team a while ago, so I'm sure he'd come on  and talk to us.  You think he's going to say anything about the Todd situation, or you think he's going  to be the, you know...  If he had balls, he would.  I would give him a lot of respect if he...  If he just unloaded and told what it was.  He got kicked out.  Yeah, he got kicked out.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  By the guy that is younger, but...  Not really. 
[00:50:00]  Hired all younger people.  But on the other side of middle age.  Right.  Please.  So...  All right.  We've got Jim Ross outside.  Yeah.  Thanks, guys, for the surprise weigh-in.  Jim with his cowboy hat on and stuff.  So, now Iraq has lost 10 pounds.  Maintained.  Maintained.  I love that.  He's maintaining.  And rolls down to only losing 19 pounds from a high of losing 24 pounds.  Yeah, he tacked on another 5 pounds.  He tacked on 5, and Eric tacked on 1 when they should still be trying to lose weight. 
[00:50:30]  There's Jim Ross.  All right.  It's about time you made it.  How you doing, Jim?  On our show, I'm saying.  Take a seat, sir.  It's a little chilly out there, fellas.  Ah, it's terrible.  It's freezing.  We've had it with this winter, Jim.  Where are you originally from?  What do you think?  Oklahoma.  Oklahoma.  Yeah, look.  He's got the Oklahoma look.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oklahoma.  Oklahoma.  I live in Norman, Oklahoma.  Oh, so you're still in Oklahoma.  Yeah.  I lived when I was a...  We're actually on the air, by the way.  We are?  Yeah, we just fly right in. 
[00:51:00]  I'm glad I wasn't cursing you.  No, you're allowed to curse over here.  Yeah.  We don't care about bad language on this show.  I grew up in...  Actually, born in California, Mendocino County, which is famous for growing great marijuana.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  I saw that on TV.  It must be true, right?  Oh, okay.  It's on TV.  I grew up in Oklahoma.  I was conceived on Route 66.  My mom and daddy loped in a little town in eastern Oklahoma. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  They took a truck in me, in sperm form, and I was conceived somewhere on Route 66.  Wow.  In the early 50s.  In Oklahoma, you didn't...  When you get with child, or you were thinking about it, you had left town.  You had to leave town.  Right, right.  Wow.  On the famous Route 66.  I don't get that, leaving town, because then where do you go?  To another town where they don't want you.  But they don't know the backstory.  Oh, that's how it works out. 
[00:52:00]  Gotcha, Jim Ross.  Secret.  That makes sense.  I'm a Californian by birth.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't even know that.  Yeah, it doesn't seem like...  But how long were you in California?  I think about...  I went to fourth grade there.  Oh, okay.  And bolted.  You said seer.  Yeah, dad was a logger.  Really?  Yep.  So it was a good growing up.  And then I got in the wrestling business, kind of back door at a college.  Our fraternity had a little issue with grade points. 
[00:52:30]  And so we had to do some things, too.  As they said, the dean of men said, you must rehabilitate your image.  I've been doing that now.  I'm 62.  I've been doing it for like 40 damn years.  How's that working out?  How's that working out for you?  Then we had a fundraiser, pro wrestling event as a fundraiser in our college field house.  And it was kind of successful.  And actually, back in the day, the promoters never used radio.  They only used their one-hour syndicated TV show because their brilliant theory was if you weren't watching, you're not going to come anyway. 
[00:53:00]  So you missed that one-hour television, you're SOL.  That was it.  That was it.  So I used, because we are a non-profit group, I used radio for our fraternity.  And I cut the spots, wrote the copy.  Then I went to all the newspapers and said, look, we're a non-profit.  We're going to help some children's charities, which we did.  And they wouldn't do stories that have sports departments, but they did pictures and captioned them. 
[00:53:30]  I actually captioned them.  So I sent a new picture every week.  We sold out the little auditorium, and the wrestling people thought I was a sharp kid.  So they said, well, when you get out of college, kid, give us a call.  So I'm thinking, I've got a big job waiting on me.  And it was $150 a week.  All in.  Righteous.  All in.  I was an independent contractor, so I had no insurance.  I paid all my transportation.  So my $150, and wife number one was with me at that time. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, how many?  How many total?  Yeah.  Three.  Oh, man.  Yeah, and the good thing is that I didn't have any money when that one fell.  I had a little bit of money on the second one.  Oh, no.  But then the third one, that's been married to me since 1993.  All right.  So you figured it out.  Yeah, finally.  I've matured enough to maintain a relationship for over a few years.  Was it your fault that the other ones didn't make it? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you have a wandering eye?  Is that what it was?  Everything wandered.  Everything wandered.  Everything wandered.  Well, you're on the road, and you're in the same towns on the same night every week.  Oh.  And you just kind of did monkey see, monkey do, because the guys were having a lot of fun.  Uh-huh.  And they had the wrestling group, which are called Arena Rats.  Oh, we know.  Jesus.  Jim Ross putting up some numbers.  Yeah, you put up numbers out there on the road. 
[00:55:00]  You put up some numbers, huh?  Good for Jim Ross.  I'm at the All-Star team in my rookie year.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Damn, wow.  Yeah, I would assume if you're in the same towns, you kind of almost build up relationships with some of these girls.  Unfortunately so.  Wow.  Happens to a lot of these athletes.  They go, you know, city to city every year, and it's the same broads in the city.  Yeah, yeah.  We remember.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love telling the story, but when we were in Boston, there was a very famous Boston Celtic, 
[00:55:30]  and he did a phone company wrong, I guess.  So the guy decided to get him back.  He would give us his voicemail code.  So we were playing his voicemail on our show.  Oh, wow.  And it was just one woman after another.  And what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, there you go.  It was just one woman after another.  And they just couldn't wait for this particular person to come to town and was already setting it up in advance.  And when I see the schedule, you'll be in Atlanta. 
[00:56:00]  Can't wait.  So when did the big times come a-calling?  I think Bill Watts owned a territory, an arresting territory, you know,  and that was such a big thing in our business is having these territories  because you would learn your skill off-Broadway, shall we say.  Right.  Whether it be an Oklahoma territory or the Georgia-Florida championship wrestling from Florida was big,  the mid-Atlantic area and the Carolinas, 
[00:56:30]  the big territory where the big money was that all the guys wanted to go to was the New York territory.  Right.  Because you had the Garden.  Right.  And you had Boston and you had Philly and Washington, D.C.  and the whole Northeast, the populations,  and all the melting pot of all the ethnicities.  Right.  So it was very easy to cast your roster.  Right.  I've got to have a good Puerto Rican hero.  I've got to have an Italian hero.  So you went around and found cherry-picked out of the territories. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  Because you could bring them in here and cast them in your shows,  and they were going to make a lot more money than they were going to make in Charlotte.  Mm-hmm.  For example, you know, that wasn't bad.  Right.  So I think probably my break came when I negotiated the sale of Bill Watts' company to Jim Crockett Promotions  because Crockett really wanted to compete with McMahon.  McMahon was going national.  And he was the New York market more or less? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Or the East Coast, I guess.  Yeah, and he started, what he did is that, you know,  the old rule was that, you know, these promoters kind of had to thief them.  It was kind of like a non-violent mafia.  We had a territory, so you don't play our territory, and everything would be cool.  And so the territories then, when Vince started enlarging,  he kind of disregarded that old school rule that we won't play your market, 
[00:58:00]  and you don't play our market.  He just started playing all, he got his TV show in all these markets,  like St. Louis, for example.  And he went in and bought TV time and made a station partner.  Making trouble.  And they start promoting and start doing well.  They have new faces.  Right.  So that was big.  So when I soaked Watts' company to Crockett, Crockett got into some financial duress.  Wait, Crockett and Watts, what territories were they?  Watts had Mid-South, which were Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, parts of Texas, parts of Missouri. 
[00:58:30]  And Crockett had Mid-Atlantic, which was Carolinas, Virginia, you know, things.  And both of them were doing well, actually.  But they needed to kind of have some synergy to compete with McMahon.  And Crockett thought he could do it.  He had still the Desire Watts that was kind of burned out.  He'd made a lot of money, and this decided he was ready to check it in. 
[00:59:00]  And so I went out to meet with Crockett in Atlanta.  Watts had a plane, and Crockett had a private plane.  And I flew out to Atlanta to work on a co-venture so we could do some shows together.  And so at the end of the conversation, I said, you know, how would you just like to buy this damn thing?  He said, really?  I said, yeah.  I said, we have 122 or 123 stations in syndication.  I was in charge of syndication.  And then play-by-play.  And, you know, you kind of wore a lot of hats in a little company.  So I said, it's for sale.  It was nobody's. 
[00:59:30]  You're the first person like we're told.  Because we thought you'd be the first guy that would want to buy it.  So we're not shopping it.  We're not looking to not go into any other promoter right now.  Right.  So if you want to buy it, you know, are you interested or you're not?  So he was obviously interested.  And the deal went down, and he bought Walsh's company and promptly screwed it up.  We got the finance to the rest.  So then Ted Turner bought it all.  He bought Crockett.  He bought Watts.  He bought all that stuff.  So then he created WCW.  Right.  With Time Warner. 
[01:00:00]  Uh-huh.  I forgot about that, that he was involved in wrestling.  Ted was a big wrestling fan because in the early days of TVS,  the only three things that consistently earned a rating were Andy Griffith,  three runs, the Atlanta Braves, and wrestling.  Uh-huh.  And that's bad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  America's team.  Yeah.  We used to have to sit through Braves games.  Right.  Nothing on.  Stupid TVS.  I remember when.  And Killigan's Island reruns, too.  Right.  The Vince years, the early Vince years were great with Andre the Giant and the rest of them. 
[01:00:30]  And Vince was the announcer.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He was the voice of WWF or WWF, you know.  Right, right.  But the deal was, what killed, and it really had a ripple effect on wrestling all the way  around in that whole business model was all these territories, by and large, were pretty  successful.  They had been in business for a long, long time.  They had their cluster of cities that they ran basically on a weekly basis.  And they did well. 
[01:01:00]  They produced their own TV show.  It only aired in that region, right?  And that was before the cable overlay had played a part in it.  Everything was local.  Yeah.  Right.  And then when cable got wrestling, and cable started, the proliferation of cable, golly,  it changed the game.  It changed the game big time.  Really, yeah.  So, I think McMahon had the idea that I'll get a cable overlay, and he did, and we're  going to run the world.  National, yeah, yeah. 
[01:01:30]  International, really.  So now they're in 140 or 50 countries.  Amazing.  30, 40 languages.  It's really amazing.  I was at WWE from 93 to 2013, a little over 20 years, and seeing the growth of that company.  Hey, working for Vince McMahon for 20-plus years is a pretty damn good accomplishment.  That is, man.  We've heard the stories over the years.  Whatever happened to his son, Shane, he just didn't want to deal with the business anymore? 
[01:02:00]  I think he wanted to build his own empire, and he's always, and proudly so, going to be  the son of the guy that built the business.  Right.  And so Shane is doing a really unique deal.  He lives here in the city.  He is building a thing where he has the on-demand TV rights for the country of China.  Oh, my God.  So if you've got, in the...  How did he figure that out?  Right? 
[01:02:30]  He's a sharp kid.  Does he know Chinese?  He's got hired hands that do.  Sure.  You know?  But he's an entrepreneur like his dad.  He's got a little vision, and he's got a set of grapefruits that are going to give it a shot.  So they have a thing where if you have cable or satellite TV in China, and you want to watch  a movie or a particular program that's available on demand, you go through his company.  Wow.  So he's got a...  He's building a... 
[01:03:00]  Potentially, one would think, a hell of a business.  Right.  Right.  Does he get along with Vince?  I think they get along better now that they're probably not working together every day.  It's hard to get along with him when you work with him every day.  Vince?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Vince is...  I just thought of Vince when I said, he's hard to get along with.  And we were talking about two guys.  So if I was on the headset right now, he'd say, God damn it.  Don't use pronouns.  I need names.  He used to be on the headset. 
[01:03:30]  Like, you'd hear him in your ears as you're trying to do a...  Producer, yeah.  ...a broadcast.  Well, Mick Foley told us, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Mick told us some fun stuff.  Oh, yeah.  He was brutal.  He was...  It makes it hard to do your job, I would think.  It is challenging.  Because you're hearing your partner.  You're hearing you, you know, in your cans.  Yeah.  The ambient noise of the audience, you're trying to pay attention to your monitor, and  you've got the most powerful man in the world who signs your checks and could control your  career at a snap of a finger with a... 
[01:04:00]  You know, it sounds like you just gargle with Drano in one ear.  Yeah.  What were some of the stuff you would say in your ear?  Oh, you know, just little things like I just did.  Use a pronoun.  You should use a proper name.  You know, if you went into business for yourself, as he would call it, and you were, you know,  making a...  I always thought that there were two kinds of wrestlers.  They were heroes and villains.  Right.  And, you know, he's kind of redefined that to where that fine line between good and evil 
[01:04:30]  is smaller and smaller every year.  And maybe he's right, but I still think that people look at wrestling as easy to watch,  kind of mindless.  Right.  You know, it's not like you're watching, you have to listen to meet the press.  Right.  Yeah.  And see which liar politician talks first.  Right.  Yeah.  So I would...  I just flew with it by, you know, and I...  One time he was telling me something.  He said, say it.  Say it, God damn it.  Say it.  And I didn't say it, you know, and then we go to break.  Then he goes...  Then he's...  Now he's back and he said, uh, J.R., yes, sir? 
[01:05:00]  Did you hear me tell you to say where it was?  Yes, I did.  Well, I'm damn glad you didn't say it because it wouldn't have made any sense.  I said, no problem.  Right.  You know, he just...  He's got so much going on back there in his area  that he might miss how you set something up  and not know that you set something up.  And so if he hadn't heard it, he'll just...  He'll nail you with it.  So it was challenging. 
[01:05:30]  But some of the guys I work with didn't handle it well.  No.  McFoley might have been one of those guys.  McFoley was one of those guys.  He might have been one of those guys.  Taz was one.  He used to be a good friend of ours.  We've just lost touch.  I mean, we still like the guy,  but we just haven't talked to him in a few years.  But he was...  Some of those guys took it harder than I did.  My dad...  I grew up on a farm in eastern Oklahoma,  so I thought my middle name was Dumbass  for like the first 12, 13 years of my life. 
[01:06:00]  Dad set the table like I was invisible.  He'd tell my mother,  that dumbass son of yours,  you never get up to what he did today.  Whatever.  So you're kind of used to it.  But you're a great announcer,  and it amazes me that you had to deal with that crap.  It amazes me.  Because I could see maybe some of the other guys  coming up and they're a little green,  but I mean, I don't think he needed to tell you anything.  You were amazing for him.  Well, thank you.  I believe this in the end of the day.  Like you guys,  we've been together for a long time. 
[01:06:30]  You've had great success.  The issue is that there's something working.  Something works.  Right.  And I don't know if you can touch it,  smell it, feel it, whatever.  There's a feel.  It's free to core.  It works.  There's chemistry.  And I always thought that Lawler and I had chemistry  and that we both have been in the business  pretty much all of our adult lives.  It isn't like you're trying to explain cricket to somebody.  Yeah, yeah.  It's pro wrestling. 
[01:07:00]  So, you know, come on.  I love it.  I'm not trying to urinate on it,  but the issue is that it's not that hard to understand.  That's what it is, right.  You guys are absolutely crazy.  The rest don't try to overcomplicate this thing.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, so that was the whole story  and how he, this was,  but he's demanding  and he's constantly looking for new ways  to present an old product.  I don't think that's bad conceptually,  bad marketing whatsoever,  but some things just don't need to be altered. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  That's like the NFL saying,  we're going to change the shape of the football.  Why?  Well, we've had the same ball now for,  you know what I mean?  It's like,  do we really need to change the oblong shape of the pigskin?  Maybe, well, probably not.  Yeah.  But maybe we'll try that.  Well, that's kind of the deal is,  I think Turner was that way in a lot of respects.  These visionary guys that hit  and become billionaires  and quadrimillionaires or whatever, 
[01:08:00]  they have this vision.  They're visionaries.  So visionaries are bold and they like change.  Is he ever satisfied?  No.  Yeah, Vince seems like the type of guy  that's never satisfied.  Never.  He's a billionaire.  Yeah.  I mean, when does it get to a point  where you should just enjoy yourself  and enjoy your life?  He does enjoy his life  and he enjoys working all the time.  Right.  I'll tell you,  I really wanted to be like him in a lot of ways.  You know, 
[01:08:30]  the responsibilities I had there were multiple.  People know me as a broadcaster.  Good old JR, Black Hat.  You know, there he is.  But, man, I had a lot of office responsibilities,  a lot of administrative responsibilities.  Picked a lot of the talent.  Yeah.  I was in charge of the talent roster  for many years  and we were down there bankrupt in the mid-90s  and I knew that  unless I wanted to shop a resume or, you know,  the one thing about it is that  in the mainstream world,  unfortunately, 
[01:09:00]  and this really kind of pisses me off over the years,  is that in the mainstream world,  we're painted with that pro-wrestling brush  where we can't have any other skill set.  You know,  this guy couldn't broadcast anything else.  He couldn't do radio.  He couldn't call a football game.  Couldn't be on an entertainment show  because he's a wrestling guy.  Yeah.  Of course,  we all know those wrestling guys,  when they get off work,  they go back to Uranus  and they sit there on that planet  until their call time.  Sure.  For the next one.  Yeah.  So,  he's a guy that is kind of a cross between, 
[01:09:30]  McMahon is a guy that's a cross between,  I would say,  Jerry Jones and the late George Steinbrenner.  He owns it and it's his ball game.  The great thing about when I came there  that I was really looking forward to  and I did enjoy was in WCW,  there were so many cooks in the kitchen  and they had so many active performers  on the decision-making committees,  it was a cluster.  Mm-hmm.  And the thing about Vince 
[01:10:00]  is that there was never a cluster  in that respect  because there is one clear-cut boss,  one voice that makes the final decision.  You kind of need that, yeah.  What amazes me is that the WWF at the time,  now it's the WWE,  was bankrupt,  almost bankrupt in the mid-90s.  But the product was amazing in the mid-90s too.  I don't know.  We actually tapped out.  We used to watch all the time.  Oh, yeah.  We would laugh our asses.  I'm trying to think.  From our Boston days to 94, 95, 
[01:10:30]  all the way up to like 2000,  that was an amazing period to watch wrestling.  We had trouble-making payroll in the mid-90s  because we had a lot of older talents  that we were rehashing, repackaging,  recycling, repurposing, whatever.  I got the job as the head of talent relations,  which is kind of like the player personnel guy  of an NFL franchise.  So your job is to go out and find new talents, 
[01:11:00]  find new prospects,  get them trained,  get them migrated into the system.  And I had a lot of good luck hiring some good people.  Mick Foley had tried to come to work there  two or three times,  and I'd known him in WCW,  so I hired him.  And a funny story about Mick was that Ben said,  I'm going to let you hire Mick Foley,  but I can tell you he's not going to work.  Wow.  And the other thing is that you need to know  what it's like to have your heart broken by a talent 
[01:11:30]  that you really love and you believe in.  He said,  I've had it happen to me dozens of times  where I would hire a guy,  I liked him personally,  and he let me down and broke my heart.  So you're going to feel how that is,  so you'll understand.  With Mick Foley.  Yeah, with Mick.  That's hilarious.  He said,  I don't have any ideas for him.  And I said,  well,  I have some ideas for him.  And at the time,  The Undertaker was really starting to come to his own  as a fan favorite.  Well,  if you look at it from a casting standpoint,  you've got this guy that's morbid music 
[01:12:00]  and eerie and all the out-of-body experiences  that we used to talk about on the air  and all these things,  the lighting treatment.  So you've got a seven-foot hero.  And so sometimes when a seven-foot hero is on the defensive,  it's hard for the fans to have empathy  for a guy that's seven feet, 300 pounds.  It's like,  oh,  you know,  you're big.  You're bigger than the guy that's beating your ass up.  So why should I feel sorry for you?  And that's a big thing, 
[01:12:30]  is that the announcers have got to put the fan favorite in jeopardy  so that we can grab you.  So when the guy makes his comeback,  there's excitement.  So I said,  we're running out of opponents,  survival opponents for The Undertaker.  So I thought Foley at 6'4 and 300-plus  cut a good promo  and took a great ass-whipping,  great bumps,  you know,  he bounced like a 300-pound rubber ball,  that he would be a great opponent for The Undertaker. 
[01:13:00]  And so we tried that,  and that launched Foley.  And Undertaker liked Foley.  They'd worked together at WCW  and other names,  but, you know,  they're still locker room guys.  So that got Foley rolling.  And a lot of guys we got lucky on.  Austin was considered a good,  solid seven-hole hitter in baseball.  He's not going to back clean up.  He might be a good DH.  Right.  You know,  that type of thing.  He's fundamentally sound, 
[01:13:30]  and I saw something else in Austin,  and then Austin definitely had the heart  to be something better.  So he clicked.  He was amazing.  Then I hired The Rock,  and I go down to Florida  to look at some other guys,  some indie guys,  and Rock's mother  had called Pat Patterson,  who was a family friend,  when Patterson was wrestling in San Francisco  with her father,  who was Peter Maivia,  Samoan wrestler. 
[01:14:00]  So he said,  well, my son Dwayne is needing a job,  and I think he wants to be  getting back in the family business.  He had got his degree  from the University of Miami,  the U,  and had gotten cut  from the Calgary Stampeders football team  as a defensive end.  CFL, right.  Yep.  And he had,  so we met,  and I watched him work out in the ring,  and I ran through some drills,  and then I had a long talk,  like all day,  and I remember we went to lunch 
[01:14:30]  at some little sandwich joint,  and he said,  I'd like to buy you lunch,  but I have $7.  What year was this?  Oh, God.  That would be about 95 or 6.  I think he's doing okay now.  I think I read last year,  a few weeks ago,  on the year-end thing,  you know,  Entertainment Weekly,  that he made about 88 or 85 mil.  He better be sending you a check every month. 
[01:15:00]  At least a birthday gift.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, at least.  Because you got the ball rolling.  I mean, obviously,  an extremely talented guy,  but when you met him,  you're saying he had $7 to his name  and couldn't buy lunch.  Yeah, and he's told that story publicly,  to other, you know,  how he's made it.  So that was pretty cool,  and I came back to Stanford,  and the old man says,  how was your trip, J.R.?  I says, good.  Did you find anybody that we can use? 
[01:15:30]  I said, yeah,  I found a couple of guys.  I said,  I signed Rocky Johnson's son,  Dwayne.  Really?  He said,  how much do you have to pay him?  I said,  Vince,  I kind of went above the rookie pay scale.  What was the rookie pay scale,  if you don't mind?  About a grand a week.  It was a train.  About a grand a week.  So you'd bring them all,  and they would live,  sometimes two or three,  to an apartment,  and they'd get their training,  so they'd be paid  about a thousand a week  to live in one city and train.  So it really wasn't so bad 
[01:16:00]  because they weren't traveling.  They were just going  from their apartment,  for example,  to the training facility.  Or if they were doing  any live events,  they were just little local shows  that might have 50 or 100 people  in the Kiwanis Club  or whatever.  So they weren't going anywhere.  So I signed him  for a hundred grand contract,  a hundred thousand a year.  And I think McMahon  wanted to send me  to drug testing. 
[01:16:30]  Or to Betty Ford.  I'm not sure.  He said,  I think you've lost your mind.  You're burning out.  And I said,  no, no, no, I'm not.  So I signed him.  He's fancy.  He's 6'5",  and he's 275.  He's half Samoan.  He's half black.  He's got an exotic look.  He's well-spoken.  He can put sentences together.  He's got a college degree  in criminology,  of all things.  And I said,  all I know is  that when we were having lunch,  every man that walked in  looked at him  and every woman  that walked in  looked at him.  And I can promise your ass 
[01:17:00]  they were not looking at me.  It might have been some dude  with a little light in the loafers  looking at him  and I'm a little chubby ass.  But other than that,  that was the story.  So I said,  he's got something  that people  that draw their eyes to him.  And he's an athlete.  And he's articulate.  And he's broke.  And he wants to go to work.  So I advanced him  a little bit of money.  And I had him fax a contract down.  And I signed him.  And I said, 
[01:17:30]  so it's 100.  He said,  100?  Geez,  for God's sakes.  You should have to earn that.  And I said,  well,  he'll earn it.  But the deal is  that we have 90-day outs.  So that means  that if we don't like him  or you don't like him,  I can give him his notice  and we have to pay  90-day severance  and he's done.  So we have a 90-day contract  with this kid.  He has a three-year contract  with us.  I think we've done good.  He said,  well,  hey,  that's an interesting concept.  You should put that  in all the contracts.  I'd already done that, 
[01:18:00]  quite frankly.  Oh, man.  But it's a fair deal.  If you don't know  and you're going cold turkey  and you don't have a guy  that doesn't have  a track record,  hey, look,  you can make a lot of money here  if you do things correctly.  You know,  don't be a turd.  Right.  Don't fuck all your drug tests  or any drug test.  Yeah.  You know,  don't beat up your girlfriend.  Don't be late for work.  Hey, Lord,  just do right.  Yeah.  Really simple stuff.  Right, right.  And Dwayne was awesome.  And he hit right away. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a hell of a story.  We brought him into the garden  and was going to make it,  we made this,  oversold him  as this baby face hero  and a big smile  and, you know,  extremely white teeth  and we brought him  into the garden  and they boot his ass  right out of the building.  Wow.  It was too nice.  Too nice.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Too perfect.  Right.  And the women loved him  but their boyfriends hated him.  Right. 
[01:19:00]  And so we did what you do.  You pull out the most powerful weapon.  Wait, wait, wait.  Before you move on,  did Vince go,  see, I told you.  Here's what he said.  Because I bet Vince can't wait to say,  I told you so.  I told you so.  God damn, pal.  I don't know.  How's that investment working out for you?  I said,  I said,  well, here's how the investment works out for us.  We turn him heel.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  If they want to boo him, 
[01:19:30]  let's give them a real good reason to boo him.  Yeah.  So we put him in this group  called the Nation of Domination.  Sure.  You know,  the black power type group.  Not real creative,  but perhaps it worked  and it certainly isn't politically correct.  They don't do,  it's changed over time,  but out of that group,  it's like a Seinfeld thing.  It's an ensemble cast.  So somebody's going to break out  and be a huge star  because somebody's going to be created.  Right.  And he was the guy  that spun out on his own.  Of course, 
[01:20:00]  then he spun out on his own  and his own group despised him.  So now he's one man  against his old entity,  his old faction.  And so the crowd  then really got behind him  and we never looked back.  He was awesome.  His mic technique  is second to none, man.  When we were watching the regular,  you couldn't wait for The Rock to,  you didn't even care about the wrestling  at that point.  Yeah.  It was just amazing  what he came up with.  Austin was the same way.  Yeah, well, absolutely. 
[01:20:30]  Austin's promos  were very organic.  The thing,  the difference,  and one of my pet peeves  about today's wrestling,  and I'm,  hey,  I'm very,  I was really lucky  for a country boy  and a guy that  dedicated his life  to being in the business  because it was my first job  out of college  and I'm 62 now  and I've been 40 years in,  in around it, right?  So it's been good for me  in that regard.  And I was there  when the company was private 
[01:21:00]  and almost bankrupt.  We hired some really good talent  and got lucky.  No, no,  it wasn't my,  oh, Jerry,  you're a genius.  No, I got lucky.  I knew kind of  what I was wanting  but I got lucky  and hired some good acts.  And then Vince's crew  and they're headed by him  then molded them  and they put the right marketing  and all the stuff behind them  and it clicked.  But, you know,  I was there when we went public  and he was very generous 
[01:21:30]  with all the guys  that hung with him  through the near bankruptcy years  with the stock  and took good care of us.  So I got no bitch about that at all.  It was a great run.  But that's the thing about it now  is that you talked about  Rock's promos,  Austin's promos.  A lot of that was just bullet points.  They give a guy a piece of paper  and say,  okay,  we need these three things  really emphasized.  And go out there 
[01:22:00]  and have some fun  but make sure  you get these three points in  during your,  let's say you had five minutes.  Well,  the guy would go out  and let it go organically  and it felt real.  It felt like he wasn't BSing you  because he wasn't working  off a script.  So now,  it's kind of morphed  into a whole lot of writers  who don't want you 
[01:22:30]  to deviate from their copy.  Yeah,  that makes it tough.  Yeah,  so you lose a little bit  of the individuality  and the spontaneity.  So I think that's one area.  I know that down in there,  a training performance center  in Orlando,  which is state-of-the-art,  is really going to be  a difference maker.  And that's Vince's son-in-law,  Paul Levesque,  a.k.a. Triple H's baby.  And it's really going to be cool.  I think that  they're trying to get  the guys back to that.  How can,  are you talented enough 
[01:23:00]  if I give you three points  to give me three minutes?  Right.  And if you look at it,  it's nothing that's,  and they did it for generations  to run the business.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  But then we got to  this writer thing  where we got,  you know,  writers coming in.  And then the writers are,  snot-nosed kids,  a lot of them,  that get their first job.  And they're trying to,  they're trying to channel  their inner stone cold  with their pimply little face.  Oh, no.  You know, 
[01:23:30]  and they haven't had  these life experiences.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's a tough,  it's a tough sell  for the talent  to have great confidence  in some of these scripts.  Then you get some  younger talents  who don't want to  make any ways  or, you know,  you know,  they'll be akin  to farting in church.  Mm-hmm.  You just,  you shouldn't do it.  Right.  And so they,  they try to memorize  on the day of the show  their scripts.  Oh, no.  You don't get the scripts,  here's your, 
[01:24:00]  here you go,  work on this tonight,  and tomorrow  we're going to do raw.  They get it  when they get to work.  That's crazy.  And then you're supposed  to be able to be,  it's a lot of pressure.  Yeah,  it'd be good enough  to interpret copies.  And be good  on live television.  To make it sound natural,  yeah.  Yeah.  Good luck.  It's a tough,  it's a tough deal.  CM Punk pulls it off,  obviously.  He's real good.  Although he's not  with the WWE at this time,  but.  Yeah,  that's a shame.  That's unfortunate.  What happened?  You know,  I.  I thought it was a work,  but it's real.  He's,  he's gone.  As far,  I would tell you that 
[01:24:30]  if I,  if I didn't think  it was a work,  I'd say,  well,  I don't know.  But I can't.  Honestly,  I forgot.  I think.  He just had it.  I think he got  burned out.  What was his issue?  Wow.  Well,  in my experience,  the two,  there are two things  that guys have issues about.  They both start with a C.  Cash  and creative.  So,  he.  That's the other C. 
[01:25:00]  The other C word,  right?  Yeah.  No,  no.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  that's a,  but cash and creative.  So,  consequently,  uh,  uh,  I think his,  he was very,  uh,  disappointed in how his TV persona was being,  uh,  handled creatively.  Right.  Uh,  cause I know he made a lot of money.  Yeah.  And,  but he seems like the type of guy that had a hand in,  you know,  he could control,  you know,  his,  his on air persona a little bit. 
[01:25:30]  He was,  he's good,  man.  Yeah.  He's really good.  He grew up a fan.  He came up the hard way.  He worked the Indies and these little crap hole buildings and,  you know,  didn't have showers or whatever.  I mean,  bad,  just,  just,  just,  just to work.  He'll be back.  I bet he takes a year,  relaxes and,  you know,  I think he'll be back.  He figures it out.  I,  uh,  here's going to be the interesting part about that is that,  uh,  uh,  the raw show this Monday is in Chicago and that's his hometown. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  Hmm.  And,  uh,  Chicago is one of the great markets.  Uh,  I mean,  they even gave me a standing ovation when it was announced there.  I was going into the hall of fame in 2007.  So if they'll cheer for me,  it's like,  uh,  they're going to love their guy.  Right.  So they loved him and they,  and they still,  they,  I mean,  they,  they adore CM punk.  He embodies Chicago.  He's a Cubs fan.  Oh yeah.  He goes to all the black Hawk games.  The,  the media love him there.  He's single guy. 
[01:26:30]  Uh,  it's a,  it's been a,  he's,  so it's going to be tough to do raw without him.  Or are you saying that maybe there's something that you worked out for?  I,  I think it's going to be very challenging.  The audience is going to take over and they're going to have a chance.  We want punk.  Yeah.  And then,  uh,  their signs that they bring will be very pro punk.  And I know that I was reading online.  Somebody says,  is it fair that,  uh,  the,  the security at an event recently took my CM punk sign.  You know,  what am I supposed to say to them? 
[01:27:00]  I don't know what's,  what's fair.  I don't want your sign said.  Right.  So,  you know,  you just,  the Twitter thing,  you know,  it's nuts.  We were able to get a few signs into wrestling events.  It's over the years.  Oh yeah.  Anthony signs.  It was funny.  What?  I don't know the story.  Why did you,  uh,  leave the WWE?  It was just time or,  uh,  Oh,  what bad question?  No.  Uh,  no,  it's not.  It was a,  uh,  I just saw you snap your neck towards Sam.  What,  what do you got?  What do you got?  I just think Sam farted. 
[01:27:30]  Oh,  I'm nervous.  Cause it,  it seems to me,  you,  I should have said flatulent Sam.  It seems like you have a few more years in you there.  I do,  man.  I do.  And I'm working on,  I got several projects that I'm going to,  uh,  shamelessly plug here in a little bit,  you know,  uh,  as any,  uh,  you know,  old 62 year old guy trying to resurrect a career would do.  Oh,  so it's bad.  I'm not,  I'm not,  it's not that bad.  I did a,  I was the host of a panel in,  uh,  at SummerSlam and it was the announcement of our new video game. 
[01:28:00]  Uh,  the,  their new video game now,  uh,  from a company called 2K,  uh,  sports,  great company.  And the video game is really cool.  It's a great video game.  Uh,  and I,  it was one of,  one of many voices on it.  So it was really fun to work on.  They had taken it and really refined it.  So we had this,  uh,  symposium,  this panel that was,  uh,  and the show was aired aired on,  uh, 
[01:28:30]  uh,  some,  what was it,  Sam?  I think it was like a twitchy TV,  something like that.  Yeah.  I never heard of it.  It was like an internet TV deal.  I've heard twitchy.  Yeah.  I never heard of it.  Uh,  but what's,  so that means nothing.  I should have heard of it.  So,  uh,  in the process of,  well,  I didn't have a script.  I didn't have a teleprompter.  I didn't have an IFB.  We didn't have a production meeting and our,  and our,  uh,  one of our esteemed panelists have been drinking all afternoon and showed up.  Who was it? 
[01:29:00]  Hammer,  hammered the nature boy.  Oh boy.  And,  but he,  look,  here's the deal.  Even though it led to my demise,  I helped lead to myself to my demise too.  Uh,  the guy had just found his son.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Yep.  Uh,  dad of a heroin overdose in the hotel room next to him.  He wasn't himself.  How could he be?  Of course.  Uh,  and,  uh,  I told people from the,  that would listen,  it probably isn't a good idea to book him yet. 
[01:29:30]  And so everybody was then became Dr.  Phil.  Well,  you know,  we think that it would be good for him to be around his friends.  Uh,  huh.  And we think it'd be good to get him back to working,  so to speak.  Just justifying it.  Okay.  All right,  Dr.  Phil,  whatever you say,  should we call Dr.  Drew also or any other doctors?  How about we just get a veterinarian's opinion?  So,  uh,  Rick,  uh,  came out and he got to LA and,  and he was in the, 
[01:30:00]  they had,  uh,  an attendant with him and all the attendant did was drink with him.  Right.  So they drank all afternoon.  Wow.  Uh,  long story short,  I was the moderator and I kind of left the train,  get off the tracks because I couldn't get him focused.  Right.  It was my bad.  Right.  Uh,  and,  uh,  I tried and then I had a drink.  I did have a drink in the green room.  Uh,  and so then the story got around that,  uh,  rumored that I,  we think J.R.  was drunk. 
[01:30:30]  Oh,  shit.  And,  uh,  the thing about it is,  is that I have had three attacks of Bell's palsy,  which is a facial paralysis thing.  And I really work hard to enunciate and I don't want it to define it.  And I don't need any simply for it.  I can't smile.  I can't show my teeth.  Uh,  people always think I'm pissed off.  I'm not,  you know,  or did you,  are you somebody,  somebody,  somebody,  somebody,  somebody playing,  excuse me,  sir.  Have you had a stroke?  Jesus. 
[01:31:00]  Who asks that?  Some idiot.  No shit.  I don't,  I don't know who you are,  but yeah,  you know who I am.  You watch wrestling.  I just go ahead and admit it.  I won't tell anybody you're sitting around that you actually watch wrestling,  because I know it's,  it's humiliating for you.  But yes,  I'm the guy that was wrestling announcer that had Bell's palsy.  So during the day,  I'm doing all this other work for WWE at this access,  this little fan fest,  had a blast,  uh,  got tired.  And when I get tired, 
[01:31:30]  uh,  my facial muscles,  I have a,  they weaken.  They're not strong.  And I slur a little bit.  And even in the morning,  I'm sure there's probably been words here to this morning that didn't sound quite right.  Uh,  and,  uh,  so I go out and do the right thing.  And,  uh,  I slurred a little.  So my slurring,  uh,  was Foster Brooks like,  I guess.  And so it was like,  uh,  J.R.  was drinking and he was in an inebriated state and embarrassed the company. 
[01:32:00]  And he should have been out there.  Well,  I,  I believe that my fault,  my problem was the fact that I didn't reel in.  I didn't drive the train.  Right.  Yeah.  Uh,  better.  I was,  I'll take all responsibility for that,  but I'm not taking any responsibility for that.  I was quote unquote drunk.  You said you had one drink in the green.  One drink.  And the story was,  I had been with Flair all afternoon drinking.  Right.  That's the problem was,  cause I was there out in LA.  And the problem was that with hindsight,  we could see it was a mistake, 
[01:32:30]  but he went up and said,  Jim was like,  that he had had a cocktail.  Uh huh.  Which then coupled with the slurring,  which then coupled,  cause the whole show turned into a clusterfuck.  Cause there was like nine guys on stage.  Right.  And you know,  Rick was doing his thing.  And then,  and so it just,  that was the vibe of the night.  And so then the story.  Uh huh.  I made the mistake of first of all,  questioning who was televising our event,  which is a no,  no.  I had never heard of Twitch TV and I apologize to any Twitch executives. 
[01:33:00]  Cause I know they're never going to invite me back.  And then I had another ad lib,  getting no script,  trying to be funny.  Right.  Uh,  this portion of our symposium is brought to you by a great goose.  Right.  Oh,  and uh,  that was ill thought of in hindsight because,  Oh,  I just,  there he said it.  You know,  he admitted it.  He's,  he's had a great goose.  Right.  And uh,  so that was that deal.  And,  and uh,  I even said,  Sam and I were talking earlier this week.  One of the first things I said was I have had Bill's palsy and I'm slurring, 
[01:33:30]  but they,  the drinking,  they,  they thought I was making an excuse.  Right.  And uh,  I wasn't,  but nonetheless,  uh,  on,  uh,  uh,  there are some executives that misinterpreted that whole deal.  I thought I felt like I didn't do a good job.  I felt if he wanted to fire me,  you got a good reason because my performance,  but not because of my drinking.  Right.  Uh,  but I kept trying to say,  look,  we got a train wreck here.  We got all these panelists. 
[01:34:00]  We had,  they had no script.  They had,  they don't know what they're going to be asking.  Uh,  I got no prompter.  If they had,  if I had had a IFB in hindsight,  I will,  I guess I don't,  does most audience,  says,  oh,  no,  I have to get a little ear piece that goes in when you're on the news or something like  that.  And you can hear somebody.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Vince McMahon can yell at you about pronouns.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  So they could have said,  if I'd have had a IFB,  he said,  J.R.,  Rick's out of control.  Uh,  do what you can to get him off the stage. 
[01:34:30]  Right.  And I would have said,  hey,  ladies and gentlemen,  it's been great to have Ric Flair with us today.  Yeah.  He's,  uh,  he's got so many obligations here at SummerSlam.  We're,  we're proud that,  and,  uh,  that he took the time to be here.  He's a major part of the video game.  He's a WWE Hall of Famer,  two times over,  blah,  blah,  blah.  And he's got to go to another commitment,  so let's hear it for Ric Flair.  Right.  And I would have,  he would have,  he would have gone,  he would have understood it,  but he would have left.  Right.  But,  you know, 
[01:35:00]  he,  he was so,  uh,  he was so,  uh,  out of it that he started talking about taking one of his Hall of Fame rings off,  uh,  and putting on his son's hand an open casket.  Oh,  wow.  So he's,  he's going over the,  right,  Sam?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Oh,  boy.  I'm trying to have fun and sell video games and be glib and,  Right,  of course.  and be the point guard and throw the questions to these guys.  And I get to Ric and I get,  and now we're at the funeral and the casket's open and his, 
[01:35:30]  his,  his young son is laying there as a corpse.  Oh,  and he's taking the ring off and it's like,  Oh my God.  It was a press event.  So they were all trying to,  and with SummerSlam in LA,  they tried to make it mainstream friendly.  Uh-huh.  So they're trying to get these non-wrestling fans involved.  Like,  look what a big professional deal the video game is.  Oh,  and then this starts happening and everybody's looking around like,  Well,  why is that your fault?  I mean,  come on.  So I just take,  you know,  I,  I,  I take responsibility for it and look back at my tenure at WWE is good. 
[01:36:00]  But how did it go down?  Then Vince got ahold of you and said,  look,  you got to move on.  That was in January,  uh,  August.  Right.  And,  uh,  uh,  about,  uh,  I don't know.  I kept doing,  if you do my projects,  I was working,  uh,  with the developmental guys in,  in Orlando,  the performance center.  Uh,  and I really love that and evaluating talent.  Cause I'd had a little track record in signing some pretty good guys and enjoyed the process.  Enjoyed meeting the young people,  uh, 
[01:36:30]  who just,  or just wanting to live their dreams.  And I thought that was pretty cool.  Same thing I did when I was young,  I wanted to be in the wrestling business.  Right.  So,  uh,  uh,  they,  I had a,  they called me and said,  uh,  Vince wants to meet with you on Wednesday.  And it happened to be Wednesday,  September the 11th.  Oh,  great.  So,  and the flight in New York.  And I,  I,  my wife said,  uh,  well,  you know,  God bless her.  Uh,  she's been wonderful.  She says,  uh,  well,  he just probably wants to tell you you've been doing a good job. 
[01:37:00]  I said,  yeah,  he's really known for flying guys from Oklahoma to Connecticut.  Give them the old attaboy.  Oh,  boy.  You just knew.  I knew that the,  I said,  the hallways are probably going to be in line with,  uh,  Oklahoma colored boomer sooner.  They may play my theme song or have a marching band.  And so I said,  honey,  he's calling me up there to fire me.  Oh my God.  And I,  she's odd.  Now you're,  you always say that you always say, 
[01:37:30]  you know,  I said,  well,  just,  that's the truth.  Would you rather get fired on the phone at that point?  Yeah.  We once got fired that way.  Like they made us go all the way to Boston,  big conference room,  just to fire us.  I'm like,  you could have just called us horrible drive back or fly.  Why,  why have you fly all the way in to get fired in person?  So I,  uh,  I got,  uh,  I got,  you know,  let go.  And,  and we basically positioned it as a retirement.  Mm.  And,  uh,  but you know,  and this is what people are going to probably roll their eyes at. 
[01:38:00]  And I can tell you it's truth.  I had,  uh,  I had been approached,  uh,  by that point,  about cause I wasn't on TV a lot.  It's hard at all.  I filled in for Lawler when he had his heart attack in Montreal and almost died.  Right.  Uh,  I did a little fill in work.  I love going to Orlando and doing that,  uh,  developmental stuff,  but really my job was kind of winding down at that point.  And,  but I had things that I was really interested in doing.  Right.  Uh,  I had gone last summer and, 
[01:38:30]  and done this spoken word tour.  They call them in the UK.  These little one man shows.  Uh,  and,  uh,  not knowing if I was going to like it or be any good at it,  or if you even sell a ticket.  Hell,  I didn't know.  It might be just me and,  you know,  uh,  the three Brits.  And we just sat together and I get to know them by first name.  We'd have a little show and go about our business.  So this,  this promoter wanted to bring me over and he did.  And I did a show in London,  Cardiff,  Glasgow,  and, 
[01:39:00]  and,  uh,  Manchester.  And they,  three of them,  small rooms,  uh,  three to 500,  cedars,  little theaters,  the three sellouts.  And the one that didn't sell out in Manchester had the most people,  but we were up against the Manchester United football game in town that night.  Good luck.  Uh,  yeah,  the good luck with that,  right?  Yeah.  Uh,  so,  uh,  but that still did a really great house and made more money for the promoter than the other  shows.  So I said,  well,  we,  we did sell tickets.  We did, 
[01:39:30]  we did well.  If we don't over book ourselves and stay in a nice room,  I think this thing's got a chance.  So I come back and,  uh,  I want to do,  I want to do more of those.  And I had to go through all kinds of stuff to get that approved to channels and WWE because  of,  it was a employee doing his own gig.  Right.  And then I've had,  uh,  I want to get into podcasting.  They weren't doing podcasting,  but I,  again,  you're an employee.  You got to go through all the channels and it gets a lot of cooks in the kitchen. 
[01:40:00]  Don't have to tell us,  you know,  so,  uh,  I,  uh,  uh,  I was ready to do something else,  but,  you know,  to be honest with you,  I've been with them so long and I had so many friends there and I still do.  And they really,  uh,  helped me get financially secure.  Right.  I didn't really know how to,  how do you,  you know,  I had,  I didn't have the,  the balls to go in and say,  Hey,  look,  I want to leave.  Right.  And I,  but this work, 
[01:40:30]  this came along,  it worked out.  Uh,  I,  I took the bullet,  was a man about it.  Uh,  and so then,  uh,  within 48 hours,  I had,  uh,  signed with,  uh,  Live Nation,  you know,  the own ticket master,  they own a lot of venues.  We know Live Nation.  Sure.  So they're,  they're promoting my show here in New York,  uh,  tomorrow.  Yeah.  What is it again,  Jim?  The four o'clock and eight o'clock at the Gramercy Theater,  an evening with Jim Ross.  Nice.  Uh,  and it's, 
[01:41:00]  you know,  I'm telling stories from the territory days,  uh,  and my career and,  and the,  the,  how I unlike,  the likely way I got in and some crazy stories.  Uh,  back in the seventies,  uh,  you know,  sex,  drugs,  and rock and roll.  There was no athletic commissions.  It was,  it was,  it was just wild west and,  and Mick Foley's going to join you Saturday,  Saturday night.  He's going to show up and do the Q and A's with me just for the heck of it.  And,  uh,  uh,  so then I want to do these one man shows. 
[01:41:30]  Then the,  then the podcast thing,  uh,  you know,  the radio pioneer,  uh,  Norm Padditz,  you know,  created Westwood one.  And he settled it for a nice chunk of change.  A couple of bucks.  Yeah.  Made a few bucks off that.  Yeah.  Norm,  Norm is a unique guy.  He's got those four courtyard court,  uh,  side seats at the Lakers.  And you know,  he's a player.  Right.  And really a cool guy.  So he,  he started a company called podcast one and he got Adam Carolla and,  uh, 
[01:42:00]  Dan Patrick and Dennis Miller.  And,  uh,  I don't know.  I've got Dr.  Drew.  He's got some players.  Right.  And then he signed Austin.  Stone cold.  Uh,  and he signed Chris Jericho.  And then my agent is Chris Jericho's agent.  So,  uh,  Padditz goes to my guy and he says,  Hey,  this,  this Jim Ross,  you know,  can you get ahold of him?  He said,  yeah,  I'm at it.  I mean,  he's my guy.  Right.  Well,  we want him really,  we really want him.  Hmm.  So I, 
[01:42:30]  I started podcasting.  I started podcasting.  My second podcast came out Wednesday and it was number one in the sports category in the United States.  Canada,  the UK,  Australia,  and Ireland.  Not too shabby.  Where they speak English.  Right.  Yeah.  Better than I do.  Right.  Oklahoma boy here.  So,  uh,  and then,  how do they get your podcast?  Uh,  they can download it free.  Right.  At podcast one.com or iTunes.  Okay.  Great.  And it's called the Ross report.  Right.  Nice.  That's catchy,  huh? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  It's perfect.  Do you,  do you talk about,  uh,  uh,  the Owen Hart thing?  Have you ever talked about that?  Not a little,  a little bit.  That was hard.  That was a hard deal.  Yeah.  That was a brutal night for everybody.  And we always,  we always wondered why the show had to go on so badly.  I,  I wish I had a definitive answer for you.  Hmm.  Uh,  I think this,  and I don't know that the fans are,  the fans are people in general that wanted it stopped. 
[01:43:30]  Right.  May not buy my,  what I'm selling.  Right.  But I don't know the exact answer.  I'm going to give you what I think.  Sure.  What I feel.  Gotcha.  We had never,  we didn't have a contingency plan for,  for something like that happening.  Hmm.  It wasn't like,  okay.  Uh,  you know,  we need to talk about everything with the show and,  and the production thing.  Now,  what if somebody dies?  Right.  You just don't,  you don't think it.  No,  of course.  Uh,  and so we didn't have a contingency plan. 
[01:44:00]  Uh,  the way that it happened was so,  uh,  uh,  unorthodox and extraordinary.  Uh,  he went to the,  they took Owen.  I was sitting there at my ringside and I'm looking at the,  monitor because we're in a,  we're in a video package and I got to react to the video package.  Right.  Uh,  when we come out of it.  And so I'm kind of watching it and I'm hearing it in my cans. 
[01:44:30]  And then I,  so my peripheral vision,  he comes in my line of sight.  Wow.  You know,  like a drop,  like a,  uh,  like you drop a rock.  Right.  And,  uh,  so he bounced and,  and,  uh,  I'm thinking,  my God,  what happened?  And I didn't know that that was part of the gig where he's going to release his,  the,  the latch and he's going to,  it's going to be a comedy bit.  So he's going to fall just a little ways. 
[01:45:00]  And,  you know,  cause the blue blazer was kind of a,  everybody pretty much knew it was Owen Hart,  but you know,  he was a,  he was kind of a superhero that had two left feet a little bit and had some fun.  And he was a comedic superhero.  Let's put it that way.  Yeah.  Right.  And then Lawler got up because we're still in video package,  ran over there and Lawler came back and he was quiet as a ghost.  Wow.  And he didn't say anything.  He just looked at me and shook his head.  No,  shook his head.  Like,  I'm going,  what? 
[01:45:30]  You know,  and just shook his head.  So we have a match.  They go out.  They play another video package.  If I recall,  they get the medical people there quickly.  They get EMTs.  They get Owen out.  So they're working on him.  And then we,  but the live audience,  the live audience saw it,  but the TV audience did not.  Right.  So then we go to,  we have another match.  Cause they're trying to still trying to get him into a, 
[01:46:00]  an ambulance and get him to the hospital and,  and see what they can do for him.  So,  uh,  it's chaotic.  And I was ahead.  I was almost radio silence.  Well,  match comes on.  There was no Vince in my ear.  Nobody in my ear.  Just Lawler and I call this match to this day.  I couldn't tell you even who it was.  And,  uh,  then we go to out of that match.  We are setting something up for another match.  And,  uh,  our,  our executive producer who was in the truck, 
[01:46:30]  Kevin Dunn says,  uh,  Hey,  J R,  we're going to come to you guys for an on camera,  this package.  And,  uh,  you need to give everybody an update on Owen.  So Kevin,  uh,  obviously thought that Vince or somebody who normally was in my ear had provided us the information.  Oh,  wow.  So I hit the talk back button.  And for those who don't know,  that's the button that you can talk to the truck,  but it doesn't go out over the air.  Right.  So I hit the talk back button.  I said,  Kevin,  I don't know the update. 
[01:47:00]  He said,  uh,  J R.  Oh,  it's dead.  Jesus.  And,  and you're back in 10.  Oh,  my God.  So I got about 10 seconds to collect my thoughts and,  uh,  they'd come to you on camera.  And,  you know,  you,  again,  we didn't rehearse that either.  Right.  Yeah.  It just comes and you got to give the information.  Uh,  and here's the,  and I don't know,  this is probably going to sound corny and it's just my own,  uh,  hillbilly redneck,  whatever Oklahoma mindset every year when they talk about the Kennedy assassination and you go to Walter Cronkite and he's sitting there and he gives the new, 
[01:47:30]  the information that they just found out that,  uh,  president Kennedy was dead.  Right.  And he takes his glasses off.  We all know it.  You know,  it's been,  it's been a part of our life,  our lives because we're all the same basic age group.  Well,  you know,  you're,  you guys are much younger than I.  Okay.  Thank you.  Uh, 
[01:48:00]  geez.  Well,  we're within range.  We're,  we're the same generation,  let's say.  Fair enough.  So it was a part of a big part of our lives.  Yeah.  Uh,  and I think of that moment with Owen Hart where I came and did that.  I came,  I came on camera and did the little piece of business.  And,  uh,  I,  I said what I had to say.  And I said,  you know,  I'm trying to say,  you know,  Hey,  this is not a part of the show.  Right.  This was real.  This was real life.  Real as it can get.  And I,  I'm sorry to tell you that Owen Hart has died. 
[01:48:30]  Jesus.  And,  uh,  and of course,  so Lawler kind of,  he didn't say a lot.  I basically handled that piece of business and it was,  uh,  hard.  And I think that when you ask about the show stopping,  I think honest to God,  guys,  that everybody involved in the equation was just in shock.  Right.  I just think that we were just in a place that cause I have yet.  And this is,  that was a 99 if I recall correctly.  And I have yet to go back and watch that, 
[01:49:00]  uh,  pay-per-view.  I can't for sure say what I said on that on camera.  And,  uh,  I've had several opportunities and it's still ongoing to write a book about my  career and about the territory days,  making 25 bucks a day.  And,  you know,  one of my first jobs was as a driver for the blind promoter that was the  boss of the,  of the territory.  He was the Vince McMahon of my territory and he didn't have sight. 
[01:49:30]  He got had,  he was a former wrestler that lost his sight in a car accident.  So I became his valet driver,  uh,  and,  you know,  got a lucky break to be a,  do a little broadcasting and they thought that I was okay with it.  So that's kind of where I stayed in that,  that neck of the woods.  And,  uh,  so I,  I just,  uh,  I,  I just,  I want to write a book someday and I will have to go back and watch that.  Yeah.  That,  that incident. 
[01:50:00]  It'll be a tough day to be able to write about it.  Right.  And so I'm,  I'm not quite,  I haven't got a book deal yet,  but,  uh,  we're going to,  the bookmark in case you guys have noticed is sucks.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  yeah,  I don't,  yeah.  That's,  uh,  that's one,  one,  amazing tragic,  uh,  story right there.  Speaking of tragedy,  uh,  what's your,  what's your feeling on a lot of these guys dying so early?  I think it's,  I think the trend,  uh,  I,  well,  obviously it was heartbreaking because a lot of guys were friends, 
[01:50:30]  right?  Good friends.  A lot of guys,  you know,  very,  very well.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  It's a common extended family.  Right.  And,  and I grew up an only child,  uh,  there.  And,  uh,  so these guys became like big brothers or little brothers as time went on,  or,  you know,  family type guys,  you know,  guys that I really liked.  And,  uh,  uh,  I think that with WWE's,  uh,  new medical,  uh,  testing, 
[01:51:00]  uh,  the out of house,  uh,  experts that are managing their wellness program.  Uh,  to give you an example,  if,  if someone has trouble sleeping,  just give an example,  and they are prescribed Ambien.  Right.  Or any sleep aid.  Sure.  From a pharmacy,  uh,  through a doctor,  obviously,  and they get drug tested and they have more Ambien in their system than their 
[01:51:30]  prescription calls for their,  they're suspended.  That's a violation of the drug,  drug policy.  Uh,  it goes without saying the,  the street drugs,  you know,  whether it be,  well,  whatever,  street drugs.  Right.  And that's,  that's a no,  no,  uh,  the anabolics,  no,  no.  And the thing they've added is that they've added,  uh,  concussion testing.  They've added,  uh,  uh,  pulmonary,  the cardio, 
[01:52:00]  cardiologist,  uh,  cardi,  you know,  the heart,  uh,  it's a real extensive,  uh,  test.  Right.  So they figured it out,  obviously.  Yeah.  They got a better system in place,  but what,  why in the old days,  is it,  is it just,  uh,  the grind of the road and,  and putting your body through that,  that leads these guys to maybe doing some stuff that they should be doing?  Or here's the,  here,  I,  I believe it's a,  uh,  a lack of,  uh,  uh,  control by the guys more and more. 
[01:52:30]  I have a hard time blaming the business and the company on somebody that likes to get high.  Right.  And someone that can,  that,  and have doctors,  some doctors are just as guilty as the talents because they've become fans and they'll get them.  And they were in a position to get the talents,  anything they wanted.  Uh,  you know,  the old,  it happened to Elvis.  Right.  Right.  He had a,  he had a friendly doctor.  A good doctor.  And how many friendly doctors you think are in LA right now? 
[01:53:00]  Of course.  Taking care of Hollywood people.  Uh,  you know,  I don't know what made Lawrence Taylor become a guy that really,  really liked cocaine during his NFL days.  I don't know.  Is that the,  was that a New York giants problem?  Was that an NFL problem or is that LT's problem?  So I think a lot of it is the lack of discipline and self-control by,  by talents.  Uh,  I think that the testing now is,  is comprehensive.  Uh,  they're very keen on the concussion thing. 
[01:53:30]  The other deal is that,  uh,  it's handled out of house.  So,  uh,  I've,  I've been to events,  uh,  where somebody says,  uh,  uh,  you can't dress in that room,  but this trip.  And I say,  how come?  He said,  well,  we just found out that the,  uh,  the drug testing people are coming today and they're going to use that room to,  to do their,  get their samples.  Right.  Okay.  I said,  when did you know that?  I said,  today.  Right.  So they drug test randomly and here they are and everybody gets drug tested. 
[01:54:00]  Right.  Uh,  and so that's a good thing.  And the other thing that WWE has done,  I think it's really magnificent.  Uh,  and it sounds simple,  but when you do this before,  they have two full-time physicians that travel with the guys on all the tours.  So at every event there is a licensed physical trainer and there is a medical doctor on,  on call on staff,  they're present. 
[01:54:30]  Hey,  if Lawler,  if our,  if the WWE doctor had not been sitting at ringside where they sit during the matches,  uh,  when Lawler lost consciousness and had the heart attack,  he's deader than a hammer.  Right.  Yeah.  He don't make it out of Montreal.  Right.  Cause he was pronounced clinically dead for like 10 or 12 minutes as they tried to get  him the paddles and the,  all the stuff in the back.  So he was,  uh,  but that doctor being there saved his ass.  He needed someone there immediately.  So they, 
[01:55:00]  they've done a real good job with that.  Yeah.  They figured it out.  Yep.  Okay.  Figured it out.  And I think the,  I think another thing too,  you guys probably in your career had known some of your peers in the,  in the,  in radio that had a,  had a just great talent,  but they had,  they had no self control.  They had no discipline.  And they demons.  Yes.  The demons killed their career.  Right.  So who's,  is that radio's fault?  Right.  You know,  I don't,  I don't,  I would say no.  What,  what's the Montreal screw job?  Pat and Buffalo wants to talk about the Montreal screw job. 
[01:55:30]  Now that it's out in the open,  what is the Montreal screw job,  uh,  Sam?  Well,  that was the,  the Bret Hart,  Shawn Michaels match that went awry without Brett being filled in on the finish.  Oh,  right,  right.  Of course,  which led to the punch.  Which led to Vince McMahon game.  Yeah.  And that,  that classic clip of Vince took a nice punch and then staggered out of the,  out of the locker room.  That was a surprise.  Right.  Yeah.  That,  we weren't aware of that deal.  The Lawler and I, 
[01:56:00]  and I was executive,  I was the VP of talent relations.  And so I was going to have to have to have to handle all the aftermath of that with the talents who were,  you know,  who can we trust and what happened and all this other stuff.  So,  so it was,  uh,  it was,  it was a bad day at the office to say the very least.  And,  uh,  it,  it was three,  uh,  tumultuous days.  Another thing,  wrestling fans are so passionate and that's a good thing.  Good and bad.  They're never going to forget it. 
[01:56:30]  Right.  Still around.  Oh boy.  Is it,  uh,  Sam is asking us about the Vince,  uh,  story.  Ollie function story.  Yeah.  I don't know this one.  It's a good one.  Vince,  Vince is a guy that he has a great sense of humor.  You know,  he's,  he's,  he won't like me saying this,  but,  uh,  he's really just a,  uh,  uh,  refined rich redneck.  Uh,  he's,  you know,  grew up in North Carolina.  Uh,  I think he had like five stepfathers. 
[01:57:00]  Vince McMahon,  uh,  his senior,  uh,  I don't know if he's really senior.  I think that's a misnomer too.  Vincent,  uh,  Jay McMahon,  the wrestling infusario,  uh,  the East coast was Vince's father and Vince's,  uh,  mother.  And he didn't coexist as a couple too long.  And then she had,  I think four or five more husbands.  Wow.  So it was,  uh,  he grew up in a real, 
[01:57:30]  Ron,  for his credit,  a tough environment.  And where his,  finally his dad,  uh,  his birth father sent him to military school.  And,  uh,  while in military school,  he got court-martialed and kicked out of military school.  The only student to ever get court-martialed in military school and,  and asked to leave.  So,  uh,  he was a little rebellious,  shall we say.  But he loves,  uh,  humor.  He loves to laugh.  And we have this,  uh,  one of our hall of fame guys,  uh,  one of the Brisco brothers, 
[01:58:00]  the bands down around the world are going to know,  especially in Florida and places.  Jerry and Jack Briscoe were Oklahoma boys,  made good,  a lot of money,  bought a lot of real estate in Tampa,  uh,  wrestling careers were great.  But Jerry's got a very weak stomach.  Uh,  a quick example,  then I'll tell you the Vince story.  Quick example,  uh,  Jerry and I are doing TV with the crew in Glens Falls,  New York about this time of the year.  It was colder than a witch's tit. 
[01:58:30]  I mean,  it was bad.  So we,  we stop at,  uh,  whatever's open,  meaning Denny's,  go in and get a bite to eat after the event.  And,  uh,  so I get in the,  we'll get in the car,  he's driving,  I'm sitting in the shotgun seat.  And,  uh,  so he gets out,  he gets in the car and the wipers are frozen.  So he gets out to unstick the wipers.  And while he's out,  unsticking the wipers,  I raise up on one butt cheek and let a little flatulent hit his direction. 
[01:59:00]  So he gets back in,  he gets back in the car and it kind of engulfed him.  It was a bad one,  huh,  Jim?  It was bad,  bro.  I have to tell you,  it was bad.  I hated me.  That underwear never made it home.  I destroyed the underwear.  I left them in the hotel room for the maid.  Uh,  but he got sick and started,  because of the fart.  Yeah.  And started hurling.  He got the door open and leaned out the car and was just,  uh,  regurgitating profusely.  Everything he'd just eaten in the denny's. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  So there went his,  there went his,  uh,  his happy meal or whatever the hell they have.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  his nickel pancakes or something.  So,  uh,  everybody knows that Jerry has this weak stomach.  So Vince is going,  we're in the Meadowlands doing Monday Night Raw.  And the height of Mr.  McMahon's,  uh,  uh,  character is,  you know,  the evil owner of a kiss my ass thing.  Yeah.  I mean,  I got a,  I got a,  I'm a member.  Yes,  that's right.  So,  uh,  so he's going to, 
[02:00:00]  what he's going to do,  he's got his back to Briscoe.  He's sitting at this table and Briscoe was a guy that tying the show out.  You know,  so make sure we hit,  we're in action at the top of the hour and things.  So he turns his back to Briscoe and I never,  I never forget it.  Vince had a pair of khaki colored slacks,  nice slacks and a,  uh,  you know,  probably a thousand,  $5,000 sport coat custom made.  And,  uh,  all of his pants,  you notice all of Vince McMahon's pants have no back pockets.  Right. 
[02:00:30]  Don't ask me why.  He just doesn't want anything to interfere with his,  uh,  he wants to show off that.  Yeah.  So,  yeah.  So,  uh,  he turns to Briscoe and he's going to,  he wants to,  to leave a little present for him.  And,  uh,  so that he can see hopefully Briscoe getting the dry heaves.  Right.  Cause he'd dry even a heartbeat.  You could tell a story.  Bob Kelly.  Oh,  you could tell a story.  You could tell a story and just embellish it.  And he would dry.  He,  he started dry.  And it was great. 
[02:01:00]  This guy.  Oh,  it was just great.  So Vince is trying to pull this off while you're doing live TV.  Doing live TV.  It's just,  he's waiting on his music cue.  So make his walk to the ring.  And so he turns his back to Briscoe to deposit something a little in the air.  And it,  it got liquid.  Oh,  he shit himself.  He sharted.  Sharted.  Of course.  He sharted.  But it's still,  it's still stunk.  And Briscoe still almost out of the chair,  holding his stomach and dry heaving.  So he got mission accomplished, 
[02:01:30]  except he's wearing khakis and he's got a brown stain,  you know,  the old racing skid mark.  Yeah.  And he's got to go out and do his bit.  So,  uh,  they told the truck and the truck started laughing.  And of course,  nobody had the balls in the truck to shoot it.  They had to shoot around.  No,  you got to shoot it.  They were,  they were,  they were,  they were afraid to shoot it.  They didn't want to be.  Oh,  that's funny.  So they tell me and Lawler that,  Hey,  you get a chance. 
[02:02:00]  Look at the old man's,  look at the old man's ass.  You know,  and I hit talk back.  Why do you want to look at the old man's ass?  Just do it.  Just do it.  So,  uh,  Lawler and I come out or we're still,  we're sitting at ringside and Vince comes out.  And sure enough,  one of those times you turn back around,  we saw a little,  a little brown and it was,  but that,  but you know,  here's the deal.  A lot of guys would have just,  I can't do the interview or this is not going to work. 
[02:02:30]  Right.  Right.  He has,  he,  he didn't care.  He didn't care.  Yeah.  He came out and did his promo.  Consummate professional.  He nailed it.  He was the,  the,  the,  the,  the enemy,  the villain.  It was awesome.  And,  uh,  uh,  he,  and they,  of course,  the camera shot around his,  uh,  his malfunction.  And,  uh,  it was just,  uh,  just crazy.  That's,  but that's him.  That's funny.  He's,  uh,  what,  what match was that?  So people would know.  We can look it up.  Hey,  it'll be on the,  uh,  WWE network,  which is now launched. 
[02:03:00]  Right.  Launches Monday.  Uh,  and that's a,  that's a,  that's a bold,  uh,  bold thing.  You know,  to have a digital network.  I actually watched it last night.  They had a show from their,  uh,  performance,  uh,  with a performance center guys or young guys.  They aired live last night on the network,  uh,  from Orlando.  And it was a little bit nippy last night and I didn't get out and wander New York streets.  Right.  Uh,  I watched this thing on my iPad last night.  It was just cool as hell. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  So the,  I think the network is for like you said earlier,  I,  we don't watch much anymore,  but back in the day.  Yeah.  I mean,  I'm,  I,  I,  I was in for a good 20 years and it's all my time.  Yeah.  It's all there.  Right.  Yeah.  It's all,  it's all that stuff.  If there's some,  if there was a guy when you were a kid that you liked,  you can do your little search.  Chief J strong bow.  And you can find Ivan put ski.  Yeah.  You can find all those matches.  Polish hammer. 
[02:04:00]  There is one guy that brought you back in.  Fandango brought us back in for a little while.  Really?  Yeah.  But I wish they held off him wrestling for a little longer than they did.  WrestleMania.  All of a sudden he just wrestled.  I was like,  no man,  there's a little more here before you go down that road.  That's always the,  that's always the fine balance is just how long.  It's the same thing with this Daniel Bryan thing.  This kid is really,  really popular and they're basically booking it,  booking him on a slow burn deal.  Right.  And nobody's got any,  nobody's not a good,  many people have no patience. 
[02:04:30]  Right.  And they want him to be made whole right now.  And I've always said,  if you're going to give a guy that,  that memorable moment,  it's got to be at WrestleMania.  Right.  So getting to WrestleMania as this underdog,  overachieving,  very talented,  uh,  undersized guy and let him leave there at the,  at the top of his game.  I E why couldn't he leave there as the WWE world's champion.  Right.  And you would now you, 
[02:05:00]  you've made it,  you've brought the thing full circle.  you brought it all together.  Nice.  And you created a new star.  Sure.  But they got a lot of new guys.  I think they're going through kind of a transition period right now.  So,  uh,  of where a lot of new guys are getting close to getting a lot of carries in the game.  Well,  well,  listen,  we got a,  uh,  head to break here.  This was great,  Jim.  Thanks guys.  Jim.  Thanks for coming in,  man.  We got Ross.  You got J R's BBQ on Twitter. 
[02:05:30]  You got the big gig,  uh,  Saturday night and McFoley's going to be at the late show,  right?  So you're doing two shows Saturday night at the Gramsci.  I do the Gramsci theater.  I'm doing a show at four o'clock.  Okay.  At the Gramsci.  And I'm doing another one at eight.  Okay.  And,  uh,  the shows consist of a little Will Rogers.  I asked somebody the other day,  I said,  I'd like to be the modern day version of Will Rogers.  And the writer was young and had not one clue who Will Rogers was.  Yeah.  So I've got to come up with a better,  a better,  a better,  better example.  Right.  So we'll tell some stories. 
[02:06:00]  We'll get into a no host bar Q and a,  uh,  then we'll do for the certain ticket holders.  We do a meet and greet.  Cool.  It's pretty straightforward.  Look,  I'm not overthinking it.  It's not going to be overproduced.  The Rockettes won't be there.  There's not a warmup act,  a magician or a,  a unicyclist or anything,  you know,  it's just me.  Great.  And even with Jim Ross.  Yeah.  Uh,  and then also of course the podcast on podcast one.  Uh,  you just started that up podcast one and iTunes. 
[02:06:30]  Good deal.  And,  and it's called the,  the Ross report.  Yeah.  If you're looking for that.  Very clever.  Great.  Jim Ross.  Very good.  Thanks man.  I signed the deal to,  uh,  last thing.  Fuck Larry King here.  I,  uh,  Simon shifter.  How's it get out?  I got a,  I got a good,  I got a good story.  I got a good story.  Larry King.  But I'll tell you off the air.  Larry does our show.  We like Larry.  I do too.  Did he shit his pants?  Yeah.  No,  uh,  but I'm doing a,  I'm doing a,  I signed a contract with Fox sports. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  So I'm going to become a colonist.  And one of my first assignments is to write a three part series on,  uh,  WrestleMania.  Great.  For Fox sports.  And that may lead to some other things.  30 years.  Big MMA fan.  And I like football.  Right.  Right.  But I'm still Mark with that pro wrestling brush.  And so.  Right.  And I,  but I told him,  I said,  I've leased my condo in Uranus.  So I'm back in America.  Now I think I could probably fit in someplace.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  I don't doubt it. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  Jim Ross,  everyone.  Thank you,  Jim.  Thanks guys.  You're the best.  All right.  Thank you.  Welcome back to cock talk.  I'm mistress Vixen.  Today,  we're talking about your first man on,  man experience.  Mm.  We have Mars on the phone from Puerto Rico.  Mars.  Talk to me,  baby.  I'm a changed man.  As of yesterday.  I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same. 
[02:08:00]  Mm.  Mars.  Mars.  I see here.  You had your first gay experience last night.  Yeah.  Yummy.  So tell me,  what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night?  My shit is so tight,  man.  I guess I'm anal retentive.  It's so tight.  Mm.  Sexy.  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick?  He tells me to lie down on my left side and I'm facing a particular direction.  And then he pulls his apparatus out.  I'm like,  hell no, 
[02:08:30]  that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough,  he goes behind me.  How big was it?  It was,  I swear to God,  about two feet long.  Ooh,  you're a spicy little bitch,  aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second.  And all of a sudden,  this motherfucker,  all the way in my ass.  Oh.  Ooh,  you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like,  he goes like this.  Come on,  buddy,  help me,  help me here.  Work with me. 
[02:09:00]  Let me do my job.  What was that job?  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Just letting that rainbow striped freak flag fly.  Come on,  alcohol.  Alcohol.  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Did he do it for you?  Yeah,  he cleaned it afterwards.  No,  he did it afterwards in front of me.  No,  he did.  Ooh,  how did he do that?  What is it?  Toss salad.  You could toss my salad anytime.  Ooh,  he licked your asshole clean with his tongue? 
[02:09:30]  Exactly.  My God,  Mars,  you are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you.  This is our secret.  Don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well,  tune in next week when Cock Talk returns  and we talk to guys about their first time  with a down low brother,  Mars.  I bet you have a story like that,  don't you?  Yeah.  Ooh,  you little Spanish fly.  You've got me all wet.  See you next week for more 
[02:10:00]  Cock Talk.  The Opie and Anthony Show  is back.  On Sirius XL.  All right,  it's Friday.  I want to thank  JR for coming in again.  Jim Ross.  Good old JR.  JR.  I wonder if he's allowed to say JR. 
[02:10:30]  Does Vince own that?  Does Vince own the JR thing?  You think Vince would have given,  I'm surprised he,  after 20 years of faithful service like that,  not giving him a little more of the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah.  Maybe suspend him,  fuck with him a little bit,  but to give him the boot after  that so-called debacle.  I think he was being nice about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because that's a long time.  Yeah,  to just,  you know,  get fired over something like that.  It's flair.  And you have to fly to New York  and then,  then you've got to take a train up to Stanford 
[02:11:00]  just to get fired?  Just to get fired.  But JR should have said,  wait,  are you firing me?  Because if you are,  save me a fucking trip.  Yeah.  Because,  I mean,  he spent his whole life just going on trips  for the WWE.  Yeah.  From the last trip you go on,  you gotta...  is to go into Stanford  and get fired.  To hear,  you're fired.  He actually got that.  That would be kind of cool,  actually.  That would be.  We got fired by,  I guess,  Vince Technical,  or NBC,  I don't know,  whoever the fuck fired us. 
[02:11:30]  It would be nice to have Vince just go,  you're fired.  I wonder if he did that to good old JR.  JR was good.  A little wordy.  I like JR.  A little wordy at times.  He's not allowed to be.  A little wordy,  but what are you going to do?  I told some good stories in there.  Yeah.  Did he already tweet how great we are?  No,  that was the tweet on the incident.  The Ric Flair incident.  Wow,  that must have been really awkward.  Ric Flair talking about putting the ring on his dead kid, 
[02:12:00]  and drunk,  and...  I don't know.  Oh,  man,  what a disaster.  I think it was a perfect storm.  or maybe WWE was already thinking of just moving on,  and that happened,  which gave them a nice little reason to do it,  maybe.  That's true.  That's true.  Sam looks a lot like his drawing.  Joey!  Looks a lot like his drawing today.  Love you,  Mr. Brother.  The shul.  Yeah.  He did a great job opening up for Jim Norton down at the Brigada.  Yes,  he did.  That was funny.  So, 
[02:12:30]  JR's a bit wordy.  Yeah.  But there were some great stories in there.  Oh,  he's good,  yeah.  Well,  he's seen it all,  but yeah,  I mean,  it's like,  it's one of those...  We'll edit that down.  I think that'll be all right for a replay.  Oh,  yeah.  We'll chop it a little bit,  but he was pretty open and honest.  He's super honest,  yeah,  and he'll tell the whole...  But that's the thing,  he tells the whole story.  The whole story.  We got any scoops in there?  Well,  I think his...  Anything in the wrestling world will go,  oh my God.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  I gotta be honest,  I was a little disappointed 
[02:13:00]  that Ant didn't break out the...  The Vince?  The impression?  The Vince or the JR.  I was hoping there would be one.  Well,  I know,  but...  Ant's still under the weather.  He was talking.  Yeah.  He was talking.  Right,  you're still under the weather.  A little under the weather.  Yeah.  The CM Punk thing...  You snap back quick.  I do snap back quick  when I have to.  When I have to.  I'm a snappiest,  backiest guy.  I did a little Vince for him.  I was trying to get Ant going.  Yeah,  the Vince stories will be good.  And the CM Punk thing. 
[02:13:30]  Oh,  that would be pretty huge.  Anything that the wrestling sites  would go,  yeah,  we gotta fucking run with this.  Yeah,  the Punk and the Vince stuff.  That's it?  Not even the Owen stuff?  I mean,  maybe the Owen stuff,  but he's definitely...  That's a long time ago now.  And he's told the story before.  Right.  Oh,  I'm sorry,  Sam.  Was that 99?  Yeah,  that was 99.  That's 15 fucking years ago.  That's what I mean.  I mean,  I don't know.  I'm not just saying  it was a bad thing.  I asked him about that too,  but...  I was driving back  from somewhere.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Something...  I don't know.  He's trying to equate it  to the Cronkite Kennedy thing.  It's a little different.  Slow down.  No,  J.R. was great.  Yeah.  Yeah,  his one-man show  will be good.  I like that guy.  He's a good guy.  If you've got four hours to kill.  Well...  And then,  Mick Foley,  who's also like,  he's got all these amazing stories.  Right.  But he also is one  who tells them  from start to finish.  Right.  So the two of them  are doing Q&A together.  Oh,  boy. 
[02:14:30]  I mean,  I love it.  It's going to be a lot of Q&A.  I'm going to love it,  but...  You were at that Ric Flair thing?  Yeah.  Was it as bad as the...  It was really bad.  It was really bad.  Like,  I was...  Were you cringing embarrassed?  Yeah,  and I was there with Jess.  Oh,  I knew it was bad.  Well,  she was cringing embarrassed  because of her husband.  Right.  She was like,  what are they talking about?  Oh,  no.  And like,  Ric Flair,  like JR said,  he brought up his son,  and then he starts like...  Why do you drag her to those things?  Right?  Well,  we were in Los Angeles.  Yeah,  but kids should just go,  hey,  here's a few bucks, 
[02:15:00]  go to Rodeo Drive or something.  No,  we were there to...  Why do you drag her to wrestling events?  Because she had to film  all my interviews.  Oh,  geez,  you turned your girl  into your cameraman.  Oh,  that's horrible.  Jeez.  We got a good  with CM Punk  where he's just berating me  the entire time for...  Well,  he should be.  Jess being behind the camera.  Was he trying to make moves on Jess?  I don't know if he was trying,  but then he lifted up his shirt  at one time  to show like a sunburn,  and it was like...  Just abs.  There's abs and V.  You could compete with that,  right? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Keep depending on that sense of humor.  That'll do it.  E-Rock's gonna have something  for the show  in a few minutes,  supposedly.  Ooh.  It's the first time ever.  Supposedly.  Right?  Yeah.  We also just saw  the snot video,  but that's a visual,  but everyone just got grossed out.  It's kind of a cute news girl,  and the snot drips  right out of her nose.  She's not that cute.  She's kind of cute.  That's kind of cute.  She's all right.  She's all right.  I know.  You guys got up  your numbers a little bit.  No,  that's why I didn't say 
[02:16:00]  she's amazingly hot  or anything like that.  I said she's kind of cute.  I even said kind of.  She's like a five and a half tops.  Where's your reporter from?  Give her a six.  Oakland?  So I get California?  Oh, right.  She's the one that has to suck  snot back up into her nose.  Into her fucking mouth  from her nose.  Why is her nose running like that?  Because it doesn't sound like  she has a cold or anything,  and then it's really liquidy.  A little coke?  Snot is a bit more,  you know.  Viscous. 
[02:16:30]  Viscous.  Yeah.  Yes.  This was thin.  And it just kind of fell out  of her nose at the end  of her report,  so she went,  uh-oh,  and just sucked it  into her mouth.  Just gobbled it right up.  Ah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Make Gerald Briscoe puke.  Ah, that's disgusting.  Right.  So,  I guess most people  have seen this right now,  so there's no reason  to veto it.  Yeah.  A little embarrassing  YouTube video.  Right.  Good luck with that.  Freaking government.  God.  You know that couple  who found the 10 million 
[02:17:00]  gold coins  we talked about  the other day?  Yes.  Government's already  looking for their taste.  Already.  They basically want half.  They want half  even if they don't sell them.  Half of what, then,  if they don't sell them?  The coins themselves  are worth, what,  $23,000  if you were to spend it?  If you were to spend it  or if you were to  melt it down?  If you were to use  the coins as is,  like go to Walmart,  fucking Target,  whatever,  and say,  hey, I'm paying  with these old coins 
[02:17:30]  I found in my  backyard.  It's a buck.  I heard it there.  It's only like  $20,000,000.  But they're in  mint condition,  so for collectors  it makes them  way more valuable  where some of these  coins individually  could fetch  like a million dollars.  Right.  Which, you know,  adds up to $10,000,000.  So the government  already thinking,  all right,  if they're worth $10,000,000,  we want $5,000,000.  What about the price  of the actual gold itself?  But that just doesn't  seem right.  That doesn't seem right  unless they, like,  maybe spent the money. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  But the government  wants the perceived value  of...  Perceived value.  Like, if they went  to auction with each  coin individually  and got like $10,000,000.  But can't you just  tell the government,  look, I'm not a collector,  I like these coins,  and...  You're just going to  keep them forever.  And I'm going to keep them,  and they're actually  worth $23,000.  I don't know.  Or whatever the number was.  I believe it was  something in the $20,000,000 range.  You can almost say that  about money, too, though.  Go like, no,  it's my cash,  but I'm going to make  wallpaper out of it.  I'm just going to  tack it to my walls 
[02:18:30]  and my room  and not use it as money,  Mr. Government Guy.  So you can't tax it.  I understand.  But this doesn't seem right.  It isn't right.  They find fucking gold  on their own property  from the 1800s,  and the government  instantly steps in  and wants it.  And wants the value of it.  Not what it actually is.  Right.  Because can you argue...  I feel like if you've got  a good lawyer,  you could argue that point.  Probably could.  Like, who's to say  that I'm going to, like,  sell them as collectibles?  You know, I like it  just as regular money. 
[02:19:00]  It's a value.  There's a value to it.  I'm going to put this  in a safe deposit box.  I'm going to save this.  I don't think it has  anything to do  with your intention.  It's whatever the value  of it is.  And that's what you've  got to pay taxes on,  which is fucking ridiculous.  This seems a little strange.  I know.  Especially when you just  turn around and go,  look, I don't have this  as a collectible.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  The fucking hands  that are in your pockets,  your wallet,  your bank account,  just fucking infuriating. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, I'm taking all my money  out of my savings account.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Mattress?  No.  Houses.  Just buy houses.  Lots of houses.  It's like Monopoly.  You're like Monopoly.  I'm just going to buy  a whole bunch of houses.  There you go.  Because at least you  could see a house  instead of a dumb number  in your savings account.  That means nothing.  You'd probably make money  better than a stupid bank account  with no interest.  You know,  I have a mortgage  where this bank  needed me to put money  in their bank  and then they,  you know,  they take it every month.  Uh-huh. 
[02:20:00]  So, you know,  that part of my brain  doesn't work too well.  So, all of a sudden  that bank account  went down to zero.  Uh-oh.  So, it was a big to-do  because it's not my bank.  I bet.  They forced me  to put money in their bank  just to have a mortgage  with them.  So, I went in there  and the guy,  I went in there  with a huge check  to now cover  for the next year  or whatever.  And the guy's like,  well, you really want  to put it in this account  to get interest?  What?  To get fucking...  To get interest?  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  To get what?  $100 for the year?  Right.  Or whatever it would be?  It probably would be less.  I don't think it would be...  Less than $100.  Yeah, we're not talking  a shitload,  just enough to cover  the mortgage  for the next year.  Yeah.  Well, could it be  maybe $1,000?  Maybe?  Not even.  No way.  I don't even think  it would be close to that.  You're right.  When they fucking do that.  I just laughed at the guy.  I openly laughed.  He's like, what?  I'm like, stop.  For what?  I go, you guys don't give  any interest anymore.  It's not really worth it.  I said, I have to do this 
[02:21:00]  because of the mortgage I got.  I said, I wouldn't put money  in your bank  or any other bank  at this point.  Why would I?  They always give me shit  about my checking account.  Right.  Like, oh, you should really  take some of this money  and what?  Right.  Put it in some fucking  savings account.  And I learned, I love learning  about new scams.  So I missed my February payment.  Uh-oh.  And when you miss, it's $35.  Oh, boy.  But I reset up the whole thing.  I'm good now.  Right? 
[02:21:30]  But no one told me  that I'm going to be missing  every month as I move forward  because technically I've never  paid February.  So they're going to pull  for March, but that's going  to be pulling for February.  So now the March payment  is going to be late.  But I wouldn't know that.  You better not do that.  And then it'll be like that  every month until I...  Your credit rating is zero.  Right.  Until I discover, oh, what the hell?  Because no one told me this  when I was resetting it up.  Yeah.  I just happened to ask somebody 
[02:22:00]  about something else.  And they said, no,  you still have to pay for that.  Or you're going to be docked  $35 per month.  Every month.  And that's how they get you.  I wouldn't have known that.  I figure the money's now in there.  They could start pulling again.  They don't look at it that way.  They're like, no,  you never paid this.  You have to tell us  that you're now paying that.  And as we go forward,  you're good.  Right.  But I'll be a month behind.  You should automatic transfer  from your bank account  into that account.  Every month.  And then you're like,  oh, what are you going to do? 
[02:22:30]  Don't we have people for that?  Someone get on that.  Gold coins.  Now the government  is trying to say  they're part of a stolen coin.  Wait.  This guy has more  on that other story.  Ron in Hotfit.  Ron.  Yo, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Yo.  Hey.  Yeah, I heard on the news  the other day on the radio  that the government's  also trying to say now  that some guy back  in like 1900 or 1901  stole a bunch of solid gold coins 
[02:23:00]  from the San Francisco Mint.  Right.  And they're claiming  that this is part of that stash.  They never recovered.  He buried it.  Right.  They never recovered it.  So now they're probably  going to just try  to take all of it.  What ever happened  to finders, keepers, losers, weepers?  Right.  Yeah, you try that  with the feds.  They don't like  finders, keepers, losers, weepers?  I'm a big fan  of finders, keepers, losers, weepers.  All right, Ron.  Thanks.  I did not know that.  Let's say hi to Paul  at Freehold.  Paul.  Hey, Paul. 
[02:23:30]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Did that guy have it right  or you got more to add?  I have not heard that,  but the actual story  on the gold is  it's about $27,000  base value.  Right.  And with gold  about $1,320 an ounce,  it's about  a little less  than $2 million  in gold value.  All right.  As you said,  the other $8 million  is the collector value.  Now, everyone  in the gold community,  everyone in the coin  collective community  thinks these people  should have dummied up.  The coins have already  been graded by PCGS, 
[02:24:00]  which is the leading  grading company.  Okay.  So there really are  some rare coins  out there.  Okay.  There's some,  I think it's 1866  San Francisco Mint  No Mono coin,  which is like  one out there.  So what they should  have done was  just had these coins  graded  and just sold them  off piecemeal  and no one would have  been the worst  for the wiser.  But what they did  was they got graded  as a collection.  They went to PCGS 
[02:24:30]  and they told them  the story  and there's a special  label that's on  the coins.  It's a yellow label  that makes it  what's called a hoard.  So a coin from  this group  is an extra premium.  Right.  These people were  being a little bit  greedy in what they did  and they should have  flew under the radar  and just had it done  every once in a while.  Yeah.  I think the first,  I think the first mistake  they made was  telling someone  about this.  Telling anybody.  Right.  How about you keep it  under your hat?  Literally.  I agree.  That's what I should  have done.  And you knew people 
[02:25:00]  were going to come  up with a story  Oh, it's mine.  Right.  There was a story  out there  that someone said  there was mineral rights.  Well, that doesn't apply  because mineral rights  have to be  naturally borne  from the ground.  Of course.  And these obviously  were not.  Right.  Buried.  I still haven't  heard anything  about the government  coming up to them  yet asking for money.  So I don't know  where all this  information is coming  from.  I think you asked  Bill Devane.  Just ask Bill Devane.  He'll tell you.  He knows that shit.  What's in your safe? 
[02:25:30]  But I mean,  I just feel like  if the coins  are actually worth  $27,000 face value.  Then that's what  they get taxed on.  Then tax them for that.  They want actual value.  The great Colin Quinn  is on the phone  to I'm sure  beat us up  about something.  Hi guys.  I'm prepared though.  I'm prepared.  Ever since the  beginning of the week  when you interviewed  Mandela,  I mean Ted Lange.  Mandela.  I figured out  what you guys 
[02:26:00]  could do.  All right.  Yeah.  It all started  when I started  hearing you guys  well, you know,  he rambles  all the stories.  Right.  That's when you  guys have to  cut him off.  Well, it's hard  sometimes.  We had a tough  time doing that  today with Mr.  Jim Ross.  Jim Ross.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You have a tough  time doing it  with anybody.  I figured out  you guys could  come.  I hate to use  the old umbrella  low self-esteem.  You guys have  such low self-esteem.  I'd like to listen  to all your interviews  with just you guys  talking and not 
[02:26:30]  the guests.  There's a way  to do that.  And you would  think every guest  with a combination  maybe feel  cancer-curing  doctors.  It's unbelievable.  You say we  pander to the guests.  I don't,  I'll tell you  something though,  Colin.  I don't think  this is fair  because I think  everyone reached  out to you  on Twitter  to tell you  about the Ted  Lange interview  and you went  back and listened  to it just so  you could beat us  up.  You did not  hear that  interview live.  Is that funny?  Mandela.  Well,  it may be a valid 
[02:27:00]  point.  Okay.  Because I saw  Twitter go crazy  like,  oh boy,  I wonder what  Colin thought  of that interview.  You're right.  Fucking Martin  Luther Lange  Jr.  Right.  But it doesn't  change the fact  that you guys  have low self-esteem.  Yeah,  yeah.  you're so excited  that somebody  stepped in the  studio.  There's not one  of us dirtbags  that you're like,  oh my God.  Well,  but who didn't  watch the love boat?  Don't interrupt the  guy if he wants  to ramble.  I mean,  but who didn't  watch the love boat  growing up? 
[02:27:30]  And then all of a sudden  the guy knows who  we are.  That's pretty fucked  up in my world.  I'm like,  the love boat guy  knows about me now?  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's the problem,  right?  That's the problem.  I had every intention  of beating the crap  out of him  because I thought  it was going to  just be like a goof  thing.  But then,  I don't know,  man.  He seemed like  a nice Hollywood  story.  I know.  I'm going to think  you should beat  the crap out of  the guy.  Just kind of  tighten up their  stories a little.  Just tighten it up  a bit. 
[02:28:00]  I'm just saying  to you guys,  no,  I don't even think  it's this.  I don't even think  it's this.  I think it's a  mental thing.  It's that you guys  are still two  little Long Island  boys that are  so privileged  to have a bunch  of idiots  from show business  coming to your  studio.  Well,  you're not wrong.  These critiques  from Colin,  man.  They're brutal.  They're brutal  because they stay  with me.  They're really honest.  They stay with me  from guest to guest.  You know there's  a lot of guys  out there now  like, 
[02:28:30]  yeah,  that's exactly  what I was thinking.  You tell them,  Colin.  The funniest part  is that cocky  Sam,  he can have  like,  you know,  he can have  the president  on.  So anyway,  like he feels  entitled.  Right,  that's true.  He feels like,  you know,  he's doing them  a favor.  Right,  right.  Sam on his  damn show,  I think he  owns the world.  Goddamn kids.  Yeah,  what are you  going to do?  He's just too  young and snot-nosed  to know the truth.  He's not beaten  down yet.  So what are you 
[02:29:00]  supposed to act  like then?  Somewhere in between.  Humble,  I guess.  No,  I'm saying  you're supposed  to act like Sam.  Sam owns the  goddamn world.  That's what he's  supposed to act.  Oh,  yeah.  Fuck.  I didn't know that.  I just want to be  nice to the people.  Sam has self-esteem.  He's like,  yeah,  this is my radio show.  I don't know.  How do you stop  J.R. in the middle  of a story  to try to move  it along faster?  Right.  You've got to give him  I don't know.  You've got to give him  allow him a little  extra time  because he's got  the Bell's Palsy. 
[02:29:30]  Can't have him  leaving here  feeling bad.  I just figure  it takes him  longer to find  his way  because of  the Bell's Palsy.  I didn't think  how mental  this is.  You didn't think  they were  on call?  Well,  I don't think  they were that long.  And also,  the other thing,  I think you're  so afraid  of the power  you guys have  where you know  you could turn  on somebody  and destroy them.  Yeah.  So,  you have to  keep yourself  you know what I mean?  Yeah,  yeah.  I feel like  we can't start  because if we open  up that genie bottle 
[02:30:00]  we're going to go nuts  and just start  destroying people.  Yeah,  keep it.  Maybe you're wiser  than I'm doing  correct.  Yeah,  yeah.  It's not fun  to be nice.  The old days  we didn't care  but now  we've learned  over the years  when you beat up  one guy  then that means  ten other guys  aren't going to  come on your show  anymore.  No,  exactly.  A hundred won't  come on.  Yeah,  because they're  all connected  with the same  publicist and stuff.  It's very frustrating.  Roland comes in  all mad.  You ruined it  with the publicity.  The publicity  is next.  Now you're not  going to get  Seth Rogen 
[02:30:30]  for three years.  What?  What does this  have to do  with Seth Rogen?  What does Isaac  for the law  bone have to do  with Seth Rogen?  Well,  thanks for the  creative criticism,  Colin.  Take it easy,  Colin.  Super Show 3.  Super Show 3.  And it's not going to be  on a Friday.  We're going to make sure  you're in town,  Colin.  Yeah.  All right,  he's gone.  Super Show 3 is  about a month away  at this point,  right?  It's on the docket.  It is on the docket.  The docket.  The docket. 
[02:31:00]  There's nothing worse  than finishing up  an interview,  looking at the phones  and seeing Colin Quinn's  name down there.  It's like,  oh.  I called him out  on this one.  I knew how this  went down.  He did not hear  his interview,  Isaac.  No.  The fucking listeners  got a hold of  Colin's,  and I saw the tweets.  Oh, boy,  I wonder what Colin's  thinking of this one.  Of course.  And then Colin  went back and  actually listened  to the Isaac interview.  And then gives a shit  about it.  Right.  With that already  in his head  before he even  listened to it. 
[02:31:30]  So he's purposefully  listening for instances  where we did that.  Yes.  All right,  Friday is here.  Oscars are Sunday.  Sunday,  the Oscars.  Oh,  with,  who's hosting?  Ellen?  That's right.  Ellen DeGeneres.  You think there'll be  some wacky Oscar  sketches at the  beginning of the show?  I sure love those.  I hope so.  Do you think Ellen  comes out with,  um,  with the Christian Bale,  uh,  wacky comb-over hairdo?  That'd be funny.  Oh,  with a little gut.  Right, 
[02:32:00]  with a little gut  and the wacky  comb-over do?  I should probably  do that.  That'll be good.  Or maybe in a,  they lower her down  on cables in a  space suit?  Like Gravity?  Oh,  yeah.  And she does  something like that?  She'll get stuck  halfway.  Right.  And then,  oh,  what am I doing?  And then the music  starts and she's  dancing in mid-air?  You think she'll come  out in blackface  and get the shit  kicked out of her?  Right,  12 Years a Slave.  They might do that  for 12 Years a Slave.  How were the teeth  in that movie? 
[02:32:30]  Uh,  what do you mean?  The teeth were too nice,  right?  They were too nice,  right?  Why would they do that?  I don't know.  They really can't  fuck up the teeth  in those period pieces.  Why?  Isn't that part of  the period piece?  Because the actor's like,  hey,  I want to look good.  You gotta think,  if you're a slave  for 12 hours,  is that the movie?  12 Hours.  12 Hours a Slave?  I think it was  a little longer.  If you're a slave  for 12 hours,  12 days?  Even longer than that.  It was more than  a week and a half.  So if you're a slave  for 12 years,  you gotta think  that you're gonna  lose a two for two. 
[02:33:00]  You'd think.  Right?  Exactly.  And I meant to say it  that way.  A two for two.  A two for two.  And they wouldn't  be nice and white.  No, no, no.  They're not allowing  them to brush  their teeth.  Yeah, no.  So why do the teeth  have to be so nice?  Tossing a fucking  oral bee  is a nice toothpaste  at them?  I just imagine,  if you're beating  the crap out of your  slave,  you're gonna knock  out a few teeth  somewhere along the way.  Oral care is not  a top priority.  They had beautiful  teeth in that movie.  I know.  Beautiful teeth.  Yep.  Jealous of the teeth. 
[02:33:30]  Jealous!  Yeah.  Who's gonna win?  Who's gonna win?  What's the best movie?  Best?  Let's pick them  right now for everybody  because every other  radio show does this.  Yeah, we might as well.  Let's do this.  Let's do it quick.  Alright, so best picture.  American Hustle,  Captain Phillips,  that's the boat movie.  The boat movie.  Dallas Buyers Club,  Gravity, Her,  Nebraska,  Philomena,  12 Years a Slave,  and The Wolf of Wall Street.  Alright, I'm gonna do  what everyone else does. 
[02:34:00]  I only saw three  of these movies.  Okay.  American Hustle,  Gravity,  and The Wolf of Wall Street.  I take The Wolf of Wall Street  out of it  because the movie  was a little too long.  Gravity was like,  after a while,  I was like,  alright, whatever.  So I'm going  American Hustle  for the win.  For Best Picture?  Best Picture.  Yeah.  I might have to  agree with that.  See, and I didn't even  see five of the movies.  Now, is this your pick  or your pick to win?  Meaning, do you think  they should win  or do you think  they will win?  They will win.  I don't do the... 
[02:34:30]  These are the winners.  They will win.  But what I want to win...  Well, that's exactly it.  Yeah, yeah.  They'll probably give it  to Bruce Dern  for Nebraska  even though I didn't  see the fucking movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio  should not be elected  in that category  because he plays  Leonardo DiCaprio  in a lot of the movies.  And he does that  very well,  don't get me wrong.  But there's no  fucking range  in Leonardo DiCaprio's  acting, I don't think.  I really don't.  Except for the  Gilbert Grape movie.  Gilbert Grape.  But besides that,  he's played a lot  of the same type of guys. 
[02:35:00]  Bruce Dern  is like Hollywood  fucking, you know,  mainstay's been there  forever.  Right.  Yeah, they'll probably  give it to Bruce Dern.  What about Matthew  McConaughey, Christian Bale?  No!  Matthew McConaughey's  too fucked up.  You think so?  Yeah.  Start beating his chest  like you were  in Wall Street?  And they can't get over  the fact that Christian Bale  was Batman, so no.  Okay, not gonna happen.  Best actress,  Amy Adams,  Cate Blanchett,  Sandra Bullock,  Judi Dench,  Meryl Streep.  Sandra Bullock  for Gravity,  no fucking way.  What else?  Judi Dench,  Philomena, 
[02:35:30]  Meryl Streep,  August,  Osage County.  Ah, they're gonna  give it to Meryl Streep  for that Osage County.  Meryl Streep.  Because that's the  only movie I saw.  Oh, I saw the, uh...  You saw Amy Adams  in American Hospital.  What about  Dom-A-Judy Dench?  Amy Adams  wasn't much different  than her part  in the Muppets movie.  But she showed  a lot more breasts.  That's true,  because it's not  the Muppets movie.  That was the only difference.  So I go Meryl Streep  for the win.  I bet Amy Adams  has that, um...  Tom Skerritt problem. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah?  Being awesome?  Being awesome,  of course.  Where she looks  really good  at a higher age  than you think  she is.  And then it's gonna  be a big fall-off.  Oh, gotcha.  In a couple of years.  She looks old forever,  but then 80 hits  and she...  I mean, really...  Like, she looked 40  from the time she was 20  until the time she was 60.  No, I'm saying  she looks younger now  than she really is.  Right.  But that's because  she used to look older.  Yeah, yeah,  because she's always  had, like, that look. 
[02:36:30]  And then in five years  from now,  you're gonna be like,  what happened to her?  She got, like, really old  because she wasn't  in her fucking 20s.  That's why.  Right.  I'm only gonna pick  one more winner  for everybody.  Okay, best actor  in the supporting?  Nope.  Best actress in the supporting?  Nope.  Best animated feature?  Yes.  Frozen for the win.  Oh.  Well, that's the obvious  one, I think.  Yeah, but that's...  That was over the top  the best animation  of the year.  Over the Croods!  I saw the Croods.  That was all right.  Despicable Me 2  was all right.  And the other two  I didn't see. 
[02:37:00]  So I go Frozen for the win.  I'm going sound engineering  in a foreign documentary.  Damn it.  I think Claude Leflie.  Is that a real name?  I have no idea.  Is this Jonah Hill's year?  That's the question.  Enough with Jonah Hill  getting nominated.  This guy wants to tell us  why he doesn't want to get  his teeth messed up  for movies.  Alex, he's an actor.  It's not up to you.  If you're in a slave movie  where you're gonna be  a slave for 12 years,  slap some bad teeth  in your face.  Your teeth should be  fucked up.  Right.  That's pretty obvious. 
[02:37:30]  No slave went to a dentist.  They were beautiful  white teeth.  They do it to get  the people coming  into the theaters  for just the looks  of the people.  They're like,  oh, they're pretty  or they're handsome.  And they don't fuck that up  by giving them  fucked up teeth.  They want the people  to be all dreamy.  That's a mistake, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Of course.  Especially if you're  trying to get  some of those Oscars.  Like Cast Away,  they did that, right?  Didn't they fuck up...  No.  No?  No.  I thought his teeth  were all fucked.  I don't think so.  The guy from 12 Years a Slave 
[02:38:00]  is nominated.  You think that his teeth  will cost him  the Oscar this year?  Absolutely.  It should.  Wow.  Let's blog about it.  Okay.  That's a good blog.  I don't think the Oscars  like slave movies,  do they?  No.  I don't think they really  shower them with accolades.  No, because secretly  they all want slaves.  Right.  What?  They're all racist.  That's obvious.  Oh.  Yeah.  Obvious to everyone out there.  What about vlogs?  I'm a big fan of the vlog.  Yeah, instead of blog,  we should vlog.  Oh, I've got to vlog again.  I was starting a vlog. 
[02:38:30]  I've got to start vlogging again.  Vlog about the teeth.  You could do that.  We're Eric.  E to the R.  He heard us?  How did he hear us?  He just turned around.  E-Rock.  Who?  How did he just hear us?  Fuck you.  Everybody's a church.  Wow.  Whoa.  I may get to say anything.  You went, who?  Fight.  Fight.  Half a hand a white.  I had the earpiece in.  I heard you.  Oh.  Oh.  Now he's listening in the halls.  That's good. 
[02:39:00]  All right, E-Rock.  We're moving forward with the show.  Nice.  So, you brought me some audio here.  Yes.  I do have to tell you, though, I received some information that people in the industry have  been thoroughly enjoying your coverage of the Todd Show.  Ah.  What type of people?  Could you name names?  Not right now, because they're trying to do something for us.  But they're pretty high up in our old company.  Can you write the names?  Yeah, but they're not going to appreciate what we do Monday. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, boy.  Which is why I don't want to say names now, because they're trying to get a certain somebody  on the phone for us.  Oh.  Today?  Yes.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're trying to reach out to them.  I will tell you right now, if they could get them on the show before 1030 today, we'll  be much nicer on Monday.  But you'll still do it?  We might have to, a little bit.  We'll have to listen.  But we won't make it sting as much.  Yeah.  We'll get them out.  We'll grade on a curve. 
[02:40:00]  Wasn't he...  Huh?  Oh, he's going to hate us by Monday, that guy.  Of course.  That's too bad.  Who else?  He's the...  No, I know that.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know who he is.  They're trying to get Scott Shannon on the show?  They are.  You think it's a possibility?  I hope so.  I mean, he's been doing everything else.  I don't see why not.  And the fact that he told Brother Weez that he said, it was like, why do they hate me so  much? 
[02:40:30]  Oh, we don't hate you.  He said...  I think he's a legend, to be honest with you.  I think he'd be willing to, if he has time, he'll call in and I think he'll talk to us.  He has 50...  What are we looking at?  53 minutes to do it, or it's going to really hurt on Monday.  A little stink.  Well, I think that's fair.  Tell him he's got 53 minutes to get it done.  It's more than fair.  So what did you bring to the show today?  Well...  And remember, I told you, this has to fucking smoke or you don't bring it. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  And the problem we were having, it started to get a little light as the days went on this  week.  Yeah, yeah.  It's only the first week.  Um, there wasn't a whole lot yesterday.  I said earlier in the show, there's no parody songs.  They're switching up the format already.  There's less phone scams.  And, um...  Because we're programming his show.  Right.  We got in his head.  It was that easy to get into his head.  To get into his head.  You think he's making the changes because of you?  No doubt.  We laughed so hard at the four phone scams per show. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  That they pulled back on the phone scams.  Right.  The fake phone scams.  They're doing two and then now instead of four.  Okay.  Um, and there's a few more songs per hour now than there was.  A little less talking.  Really?  Yeah.  That's always good when the PD comes in and says, hey guys, uh, why don't you talk less?  And, um, there's a clip on that disc I gave you just as an example of, um, I guess how  seriously they're taking this.  Maybe your comments.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:42:00]  I have something else.  Yeah.  I'm schizo today.  Did you get Jim, uh, J.R. to cut anything for our show?  No.  Oh!  He was in a rush to get out of here.  That's why.  He owes us, man.  Um, he was on a half hour longer than he should have been, so he, he's gotta, you know.  Oh my God!  Where did I open up today?  Yeah, that's not to say we can't get it done.  All right.  Because he's in town for a couple days.  Tag team champs.  Something like that.  That, that over-the-top stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I meant to ask.  I just assumed you guys were gonna throw him in the other room for a couple days.  Yeah, you had to rush out of here. 
[02:42:30]  Back to you, Eric.  Um, there's an example on that disc there where they're, um, so particular now about what's  going on that, um, the old, you know, have to end on a laugh, end on a joke, hit the  sweeper, go to break.  Uh-huh.  But they're, they're jumping the gun.  They're even cutting Todd off.  Like, while he's still talking, the sweeper's already hit, and then his mic goes off.  It's obvious you hear them turn his mic off while the sweeper's.  Oh, boy.  I see the promotional thing.  Right.  That should have been a surprise.  Yeah.  Because now I know.  Well, because you were skeptical about anything coming in. 
[02:43:00]  All right.  That's the only reason I put it there.  Uh, so we've been taking a look at, uh, the Todd show all week.  Oh, yeah.  Because he's one half of the Scott and Todd show that was very successful for-  Which, by the way-  For, for a few of the 20-some-odd years they were on the radio together.  If you read any of the bios or press releases for the Todd show, Scott and Todd never existed  for the last 22 years.  Oh, God.  Todd was the co-host of The Big Show.  Oh, boy.  A morning show on PLJ.  We were-  That's what they call it?  It's on the- I think it's on the PLJ page now. 
[02:43:30]  We were erased from WAF's history.  Yep.  Erased.  They did that retrospective, right?  They actually did a history of the station.  And brought people back.  And we weren't even part of it.  I think there was one slight mention, but I'm trying to remember exactly, but it was such  a joke.  That was Dave Douglas for you.  Oh, yeah.  Holding a fucking grudge.  Fuck Dave.  You kept your job.  Asshole.  But they erased us from the history of AAF for this big retrospect.  I think it was FMQB did it. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  If you could find that, it'd be hilarious.  Because I think there was one slight mention of us.  Yeah.  But it was kind of peripheral.  I didn't-  I forgot.  I don't know if I'm remembering this right.  Didn't BCN do sort of the same thing and never mention that you guys were on in the afternoon?  Yeah.  We never worked in Boston.  We just never mentioned.  Right.  Yeah.  We didn't make the BCN one or the AAF one.  And we were successful for both places.  The Todd Show, though.  We're going to play just a couple more clips before we move on to Scott Shannon's solo show 
[02:44:30]  on Monday.  Right.  They now have 49 minutes.  I've sent the email.  Or it really stings on Monday.  It's going to sting.  Do you think they're scrambling?  Unless he does a good job.  Eh, you know.  I'm sure he will in a music-based format where it's just him.  I think he'll do all right.  I think his break's going to be very short, easy, and quick, and nothing too crazy.  But Todd, man, he's trying to get it done.  He was the one who said in his opening statement that he's going to, what, reinvent regular radio 
[02:45:00]  or something?  New York's hometown station is going to show you how it's done.  Show you how it's done.  With his battle-tested microphones.  Battle-tested microphone.  Can't be serious, XM.  No, that started the whole war.  Maybe I should take one of those gigs.  What gigs?  One of these gigs.  The easy ones?  The easy gig.  Yeah, take one of these.  Just kick back.  Spin some tunes.  Throw my name in the hat.  What do you got?  That's it.  What do you got, CBS? 
[02:45:30]  Shit, gosh.  What do you got?  What do you got, Clear Channel?  I'm willing to listen.  This is Todd from today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't have a sex tape, but we do have a pet bird named Charlie who's been trained  to say dirty words that rhyme with nose.  Let's do the show in the morning, 95.5.  Ugh.  What?  What?  The auto-tune.  Dirty words that rhyme with nose?  Yeah.  They have a parrot that says dirty words that rhymes with nose. 
[02:46:00]  That's crazy.  What word are they?  Hose?  Bros?  Is that even dirty?  Dirty words.  Blows?  Well, why wouldn't they say that rhymes with bunt?  Yeah.  Right?  Or mock sucker.  Something.  That's a good one, too.  Homos.  Homos.  That's a good one.  Right.  No.  Cock, but that doesn't rhyme.  Does it?  No.  Huh.  Peck is.  Oh, no.  Trigger.  No, that doesn't rhyme. 
[02:46:30]  Go for the joke.  What?  Oh, yeah, if you wanted to.  Maybe the parrot says balls on the nose.  Yeah.  It's their new edgy imaging.  Yeah, that'll get them some new.  That's fun.  Some new ears.  Yeah.  The auto-tune and all that noise.  Who needs uncensored SiriusXM when you got stuff like that?  Great stuff.  I gotta agree with you on that one.  Great stuff.  When you drive to work and flip the dial, hoping to find something to drag out a smile.  You need something to jumpstart your morning. 
[02:47:00]  Here's something.  Here's something.  Wow.  Find someone that can do the voices.  Holy shit.  Here's something.  That is so embarrassing.  Here's something.  I'll be right back.  What's happening?  It might be.  Oh.  Then it jumps out your morning.  Like a strong cup of joe.  Another eight long hours to go.  Todd will get you through the traffic.  He's awfully photographing.  And you can't help him laugh at your radio. 
[02:47:30]  It's time for The Time Show.  Wow.  Wow.  Not even close to the voices.  And the show's not even, like, popular anymore.  No, it's, why would you do that?  But you're right, it sounds nothing like the people on that show.  Oh, that's bad.  Usually, you know, you get everyone together, see what voices they could do, and then you  go with those voices.  So that's the best voices they got.  That's bad.  Eric ran out of here, so maybe they're taking our threat very seriously.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:48:00]  He ran out of here.  They need to.  Is it happening?  Hey, Mike P.  Open the door.  He ran out.  Open the door.  Oh.  Let's see.  He's on the phone.  Is he right there?  Is he there?  Or did he run to the office?  Oh, he's in the pressure room.  Travis, is this going down?  Yes, it is.  Oh.  So we are going to be speaking with Scott Shannon, formerly of the Scott and Todd Show.  Oh, my God.  This could be the greatest ever.  And Monday, part of the Scott Shannon Show. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  I got a tree on my house.  I don't see the boat movie.  I got a tree on my house.  I'll do it like a battery car.  Let me do the tree one.  You do the boat.  All right.  I'll do the boat movie.  Because I want to have fun, too.  Are you going to bring up the separation between anybody?  Oh, God, yeah.  No.  And if he doesn't give us any scoop, then we're done with this shit.  You should let him know that if there are no scoops, Monday is going to be bad.  Oh.  Oh.  Jeez.  He's a hostage. 
[02:49:00]  He's a guest on the show.  He's a hostage.  Say these words.  Say these words.  He's a hostage.  Wow.  Is Iraq making this out?  Or is this like, I got Corey on the phone.  Yes.  What's going on, Travis?  He has the hotline number.  It's up to him when he calls now.  Oh.  All right.  So it might not be for...  What just went down, Eric?  E to the R.  So they're taking our threat very seriously.  Yes. 
[02:49:30]  Okay.  They are, they confirmed that, I guess they talked to Scott, he will do it.  Nice.  I just gave him the hotline.  Nice.  So I said he has till 1030.  Nice.  And...  Did he say the part about we'll make it sting?  Um, yeah.  I said, um...  Unless you want Monday to be really difficult.  Oh, no.  So...  I love it.  Nice.  They gave the number to him.  They're passing it along to him.  And I said he has till 1030.  The king of Jocktober is going to be calling our show in a mere few minutes, hopefully. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, man.  All right.  We'll play another horrible clip from the Todd show, then.  Because, you know, uh, Brazil...  Oh, what's this Brazilian butt lift talk?  Uh, they're, they're talking about, I guess it's, uh, this underwear thing or something  that lifts women's butts up.  Right.  And, uh, Todd has a humorous take on it.  Holy fuck, Spike Lee's outside the studio.  Spike!  I don't...  Yo, Spike!  See, I don't, uh...  I don't think that's...  What?  I don't think that's Spike.  I think that's just a diminutive black gentleman. 
[02:50:30]  He's got glasses, but...  Are you sure that's not Spike Lee?  Um...  Yeah, that's not Spike Lee.  Yeah, no.  Is he looking at you?  He's eyeballing you now.  Oh, boy, is he.  Yeah.  You're Spike Lee, right?  She's looking at him, motherfucker.  Love your mission!  So, we're talking about the Brazilian butt lift talk, which is what?  Just underwear that makes your butt look better?  Yeah, I think it was just something that lifts girls' butts up.  Stories that they custom make for this type of radio.  Did you know, uh, Brazilian butt lifts are on the rise?  I read this. 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  On the rise.  I like how you did that.  What?  Can you explain it to me?  Well, they're up 16%, so when they do Brazilian butt lift, I thought it was an implant, but  I guess I was wrong when I read the full article.  They actually take fat from other parts of your body, inject it in your butt, but they  said it was up in 2013.  They actually say about 10,000 butts were done.  So far, so good.  So now there better be some jokes.  Oh, it's coming.  There you go.  That was the setup.  Bring on the jokes.  10,000.  What does it do?  It just simply lifts it?  It almost makes it maybe more round and come out a little bit more, or... 
[02:51:30]  So it's the Kardashian butt.  Oh, that's where it's from.  Yep.  I don't like those.  You don't like the big, big butts?  I cannot lie.  I cannot lie.  I don't like big butts, and I cannot lie.  I'm a white guy, so that's why.  And then it went to traffic.  Wow.  He, uh, he killed with that one in the room.  He lied and, uh, he laid in wait.  There was supposed to be a joke. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I think that was, uh, I think that was it.  He was doing some pop culture.  Can we tell by them laughing like that?  Do you think they're told before the show, like, look, when Todd makes a joke, let's  keep it fun.  Right.  You guys need to laugh.  All right.  Still waiting for Scott Shannon to call the King of Jocktober.  That's a good title to have, the King of Jocktober.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  What's happening?  I was told, uh, the number had been passed to him, and now we wait. 
[02:52:30]  That's, uh...  He's going to make his way, right?  I hope so.  Andrew from Jersey has a very interesting scenario.  I liked the bit when it was called Cursed Man myself.  Oh!  Oh, Cursed Man!  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah.  It's a little forced.  But it here, yes.  When it's in that format with the production and the big intro, it's like...  When I was checking in on the feed, I heard the middle of that, I went, oh my God, this 
[02:53:00]  is horrible.  And then I played the whole thing back, and I was like, oh, that's...  Right.  And you were right.  It was...  Whatever.  I'm not going to beat up Vic.  Let me say hi to Bill in Georgia.  Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Everybody that hashtagged anything to the Todd Show, he blocked them from his personal account.  I think the only one I'm not blocked from is the PLJ itself account.  What do you expect him to do?  I saw one picture where the guy was completely covered in shit. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, but he's supposed to not block that guy?  Supposed to chuckle.  Right.  Of course he's blocking people.  Hey, that was my pick.  Oh, you.  The guy jacking off in the tub covered in shit.  Jesus.  All right, Bill.  Thanks.  Covered in shit.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Did you hear about that comedian, Tim Wilson, that had a heart attack and died?  I hadn't heard you guys mention anything about it.  Who?  You heard about that?  Do we know him?  Tim Wilson. 
[02:54:00]  He was on John Boy and Billy's show a lot, but I think he was a lot down in the South.  But he was a pretty big comedian, but he had a heart attack, I think, day before he died.  I don't remember.  Let me take a look at Tim Wilson, the picture.  I don't think I've even heard of the name.  He was on John Boy and Billy a lot for years.  I heard him years ago before I ever found you guys, and he was on there for a long time doing stuff with them.  Yeah, he looks familiar.  Yeah, I am.  Oh, sure.  Okay.  He kind of looks familiar.  He looks very familiar.  Kind of a Jeff Potsworthy type guy. 
[02:54:30]  A lot of Southern about comedy.  Well.  Right.  Yeah, he wasn't very old, I don't guess.  Godspeed.  All right.  Thanks, Bill.  All right, man.  See you.  All right.  Eric, I guess it's going to be a bust.  We've got 28 minutes left.  No, but that's at 1030.  We're not going to take the call at 1030.  All right.  He has 25 minutes left.  He's got like 15-ish.  Yeah.  Because we need a good five minutes with the guy.  Exactly.  Maybe seven.  I don't know if he's ever talked five straight minutes on the radio. 
[02:55:00]  I'm exhausted.  All right.  Well, there's the top.  Well.  No, I'm not doing it.  I'm not even going to start.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm not doing it.  No.  Phone scam time.  All of the relief.  No, it's not.  It's not time.  No one is saying it's time.  Phone scam time.  No one is saying phone scam time.  What a fucking.  Todd.  Oh, what the heck.  This one's different.  What?  This one's different.  These friends make fun of her because she's 30 years old. 
[02:55:30]  She's never learned to ski.  She's talked about it for years and finally made the decision to find a ski instructor and learn.  All of her friends skied.  She was left out.  But they're like, you know, you really at 30.  Yeah, it's time.  I'm like this.  We're at 30.  What the hell?  You're just getting going.  What the hell?  Lucky for us, we got a hold of her before she could find a real ski instructor.  This is called the Snow Pro.  Uh-oh.  What is it called that?  Hello.  Why are we doing this?  Hello, this is.  Oh, you want the name? 
[02:56:00]  This one's different.  I look for Meryl.  Marie.  Okay.  My name is Norris Ski Paul Slevingstein.  Okay.  I'm the ski struster.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  This is racist.  You called for lessons, yeah?  I did.  Yes, I did.  Why are you doing an Asian voice for it?  Oh.  I just, you know, I just now kind of had an interest in it and I wanted to get into it.  And I know that I'm a beginner, so I needed some help.  Wow.  You're old, no?  Why are you waiting so long?  I thought it was like sort of a kick, that Billy Crystal. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Oh, right.  You look marvelous, guy.  There you go.  Rid of that shit.  And lots of music and commercials.  I went to take a break and when we come back, the king of Jocktober himself might be on our  show.  We'll see.  Scott Shannon, we'll see.  Yeah, stay there.  Well, this could be awkward.  Not at all.  We got a legend on the phone line.  Yes.  Mr. Scott Shannon.  Scott.  I think this proves that I'm an effing idiot. 
[02:57:00]  I am an effing idiot.  Not at all.  Let me just read this to you.  All right.  Go ahead, Scott.  Hello.  We were wondering if Scott would be available for a phone interview with O.B.  and Anthony to promote your debut on your new station.  Right.  It would be a totally serious interview and not an attack or anything negative.  Who the hell would write that?  Nagel wrote.  Nagel.  Who do you think I'm an effing idiot? 
[02:57:30]  Well, they've been a supporter of Scott's and respect for me.  He's laughing.  What are you crazy?  I used to listen to you guys all the time when you had the O show.  Remember you made a star out of Jay Mowler?  Yeah, of course.  Yes, we did.  I'm listening to going home every single day.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Why weren't you this funny in the Scott and Todd show?  This is hilarious.  And then we're just cruising along doing our cheesy little radio show. 
[02:58:00]  And then comes that effing rock over.  I'm sorry, jock over.  Rock over, right?  Oh, no.  We've got to have five people on the website.  Trying to get all your friends.  All you guys have got nothing better to do but sitting on a little trailer masturbating.  On Scott and Todd homosexuals, you're a tag. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  And what is it in the car?  We're just trying to do, you know, a little radio show.  Of course.  Of course.  But you know how it is.  You get bored after a while.  Best we could possibly do it.  Here comes Zamboni Boy from Dubuque, Iowa.  You homo.  You homo.  And you and you are a homo radio show. 
[02:59:00]  What a bunch of assholes.  What the hell, Scott?  What happened to you with Scott and Todd?  You're hilarious.  I just finally ran out.  That was all.  It was time to do something different.  Yeah, time to move on.  And you guys have been so polite to point out.  And I'm not a kid anymore.  What's going to happen to us, too?  Come on.  We're not that far behind you.  We're not that far behind.  Right.  I ran into a lady at the A&T store in Westchester where I live. 
[02:59:30]  And she stopped and she's staring at me.  I said, what's wrong?  She says, well, you don't look 80.  I said, what do you mean?  She says, well, I listen to all the people that you can answer.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm like 80 years old.  That's not nice.  God, man.  Well, despite your efforts to destroy my life, I guess.  Well, you sure rebounded pretty quick on getting a gig.  Well, you know, I did the, they were going to do like a full week of, you know, the crap 
[03:00:00]  when you play back.  Oh, God.  Right.  I just walked, I walked in on a Thursday and said, you know, tomorrow is the day.  That's it.  I'm getting out of here.  Yeah.  You take over.  You put your new show together and do it.  And I, of course, you know, you know what the weather's been like here.  So I said, I'm getting out of here.  I went to Florida for a couple of weeks and just kind of hung out on the golf course.  And just, you know, just relaxed and figured out what I wanted to do. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  No one leaves radio like that.  You usually just get fired.  Well, you hear that all the time.  You know, it's kind of weird because, you know, what they say, once you do, once you  retire, there's only one more major event left in your life.  Yeah.  That's true.  So as long as you keep working, maybe you can push that one off for a little while.  And I'm like, you guys, I don't have any other skills.  No.  We barely have this one, Scott. 
[03:01:00]  Wait a minute.  Was Anthony used to put in air conditioning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I played golf with a doctor and he used to work on my office and he was so proud.  That was his plane to say.  Yeah.  I probably worked on everybody's office.  I don't know.  Long Island.  He was always funny, even when he was putting in the vents.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd crack him up in the attics.  I got to tell you, I think we just turned into Team Scott. 
[03:01:30]  Big time.  Oh, we're on Team Scott.  Like, big time.  I don't mind.  You know.  Monday.  You start your show Monday?  Yeah.  I'm on Monday.  I called Peter Chris.  You know, a guy from Kiss.  I said, why don't you come on my show?  Let's talk a little bit.  I live 90 miles from New York.  I'm not driving in.  Nobody asked you to have a dry man.  There's a phone.  I can talk to you.  Yeah, exactly.  We got some other people checking in, so it'll be, you know. 
[03:02:00]  Scott, I got to tell you, my pal, Brother Weez, made me feel really guilty.  I guess I go, we're talking, talking at this convention, one of those stupid radio conventions.  Yeah.  And Weez is up there, and he takes the whole thing over.  Oh, for God's sakes.  Yeah.  I think you about half cleared the room out.  Women were leaving, and old men.  Killed the room.  Right.  Talking about, you know, the one who abuses, you know the story, because I think he's only  got about five.  Right.  You know the story about he took the Viagra, and his bony was up in the air, and all that. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, I got pictures, if you want me to send it to you.  No, I'm just probably got them.  I got actual pictures of Weez with a solid boner.  Very impressive.  He probably has them already, because he's a homo, remember?  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Scott's got them already.  I got an ID called homo from S&P.  Homo.  But Weez goes, we was talking about being friendly, and I said, which one of those sons of bitches  hate me?  I'm not a bad guy. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, man.  I haven't killed any couples.  Nice enough guy.  I think Brother Weez questions his friendship with me all the time.  He's always sitting me down and trying to tell me, man, why Scott Shannon?  I'm like, I don't know.  We were bored, Weez.  What do you want from us?  You know what he says to me?  He says, I'll take care of that.  I said, no, you're not.  That'll just make it worse.  I can't let him mention it.  Don't mention it to him.  No, that one made me feel bad. 
[03:03:30]  But, you know what?  If we don't know the person, you know this deal.  It's a lot easier to do.  Oh, yeah.  It's always easy.  You know, I always said before, when I first got into New York, and I had the mornings,  and I went, oh, man, this is the coolest radio I've ever heard.  This is great.  And then his turn came along, and all of a sudden, you know, I was a dipshit after that.  And it's kind of funny. 
[03:04:00]  Somebody said, why don't you do that?  I can't do that.  I just, that's not me.  I can't do that kind of radio.  I'm not willing to pay the price you guys are willing to pay.  Well, Scott, we got a few shots in for you, trust me, over the years with that guy.  We got some nice shots in.  I don't know how you, aren't you in the same building?  Yeah, it makes it extremely, but he's, like, he's, we don't, no one even sees the guy.  No one sees him.  That's how weird that dude is.  He doesn't even walk around. 
[03:04:30]  He's a strange bird.  I'm not saying anything, because I don't need one more show coming to you.  I just do a different kind of radio, and honestly, you know, but I certainly enjoy the kind of humor you guys have.  You know, he always cracks me up, and I love the, you know, the sound effects, and the way you bang on people is funny.  And that's always funny, too, as you.  Right.  I don't find it, then I don't find it funny. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, no, not quite as amusing, right.  Goddamn, Scott.  I'll come over there one day and hang out with me.  I don't care.  That'd be fun.  No, we would love that.  You're a legend.  Definitely.  We all know that.  It was just not the type of radio I went into, because I never had the voice, so I had to do something.  I don't have a voice.  You know, here's the problem.  I'm a high school dropout.  I never even had an air conditioning dropout.  I never had an air conditioning dropout for what she did.  And all I ever wanted to be was a stupid disc jockey. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And that's quite an ambition.  What do you want to be?  Who do you do?  I guess it worked out, though.  So, I don't have a deep voice, and I don't have a deep vocabulary, so this is what I do.  So I'll do it until I die.  I think, I personally think there's bad blood between you and Todd.  Are you going to ever talk about it on your new show?  Probably not.  It's not my, you know, it's not my stuff.  He ain't no bad blood.  He just, you know, he wants to have his own show. 
[03:06:00]  He wants to be, you know, he wants to run the show.  Right.  And, you know, it's kind of tough when there's somebody else around, and you do one of your scams,  and somebody says, hey, I really like your scams, Scott.  Oh, and you're like, yeah, that's not mine.  I'm trying to get that all the time.  You're the one that does all the impressions.  Yeah.  I'm the other one.  But, you didn't really like those phone scams, did you?  I laughed at some of them. 
[03:06:30]  What do you say?  I laughed at some of them.  I laughed at him.  He's a funny dude, you know.  I laughed at some of them.  What would be the percentage, though?  Like, maybe, let's be honest, like 10%, 15%.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I want to read my note again.  It would be a serious interview, not an attack or anything negative.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  So he could tell Zamboni boy out in the field. 
[03:07:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  Don't send the homo picture today.  Can you just say, I got a tree on my house, please?  Are you ready?  Yeah.  I got a tree on my house.  Oh, that's a different one.  Yeah, I got a tree on my house, motherfucker.  I want to see the boat moving.  I got a tree on my house.  People.  Here's what happens.  See, at times, as you get a little older, you have memory dropouts.  Oh, man.  That's exactly what happens. 
[03:07:30]  I'm better on some days than I am on others.  Right.  Did the whole I got a tree on my house thing get back to you from us?  Oh, it blew up pretty good.  You know what, though?  Here's the great part.  If I find it funny, it's either been Bobby or somebody.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  People call in and do impressions of the idiot on the Scott and Todd show.  Scott, you just turned us around. 
[03:08:00]  You have no idea.  The whole audience.  I'm reading here.  They're loving it, man.  I got to tell you what, though.  I got to tell you what.  Somebody sent me some of the pictures.  Oh, boy.  From the news show.  Right.  The guy driving down the road with a gun to his head.  Oh, my God.  Do me a favor.  Don't even mention my show.  Just let me die.  That's the best thing we could do is not talk about it. 
[03:08:30]  Don't tell him what happened.  Station on the left city.  Tell him to move to Miami.  I'm on Magic 102.  Personal favor.  We'll do that.  That's all I'm asking.  Oh, my God.  Scott Shine just killed for 15 minutes on our show.  I love it.  Holy.  I love it.  I'll come by and do the show with you guys one day.  Yeah, we would love that.  That would be a blast, man.  Scott.  Is Jay Moore still come on?  Yeah, he hasn't been around.  He just wrote me the other day.  He'll be on in a couple weeks. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, we'll have him on in a couple weeks.  That'd be too big a star to hang out with you guys.  He's becoming huge.  He's a bastard.  Huge.  Well, I'm certainly not.  I'll be there.  Let me know.  All right.  The new show starts up in New York on CBS FM.  Don't tell anybody.  Don't tell anybody.  I'm retired.  I'm in Florida.  I'm in Florida.  All right, Scott.  Best of luck, Scott.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Love you.  Miss you, brother. 
[03:09:30]  That is a fucking...  That's a real dude right there.  Team Scott Shannon.  I don't even want audio clips.  I don't give a fuck what he does on his new show.  That's it.  We just make it hurt that much more.  Because he obviously was being held back by Todd.  Obviously.  The fuck?  That's the same guy?  I know.  Well, what he didn't say spoke volumes when you asked him about Todd.  He goes, well, I don't want to really say anything.  He's not denying that they didn't get along.  I like how this phone scams.  I laughed at some of them. 
[03:10:00]  He just killed it.  Yeah.  That was great.  That's not the guy that was doing the show with Todd.  No.  Todd was holding him back.  Absolutely.  I hope he brings some of that to his new show.  A little more honesty and just let it fly, man.  He's an older guy.  Just let it go.  Damn.  That was good.  That's him letting it go without worrying about program directors or the format or anything  else.  Good for him.  He just killed for 15 minutes.  This is the greatest day of my career.  He's a...  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Anthony and Scott Shannon. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, United.  Because you worked with Scott for a little while, right?  A little bit, yeah.  Yeah.  That goddamn Nagel.  He goes, let me read my note.  My note from Nagel.  Nagel.  He actually...  I forgot.  In the gym voice, the gym has done a hundred times.  I know.  He actually said, that Nagel kid.  That Nagel kid.  I forgot he never called me by my first name.  What did he call you?  That.  He was like, Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Or Noogie.  Sex Nagel.  That's Sex Nagel.  I swear to you, I don't want one clip.  I don't care.  No.  Okay?  I don't care.  Best of luck to him. 
[03:11:00]  Best of luck to him.  I hope, though, he brings what he just did for us to his show.  Yeah.  That is unfiltered.  Why not?  Yeah.  That's hilarious, man.  That was funny.  That was hilarious.  His timing was right there.  It was great.  Give him an hour here.  I like that.  Wait, let me read my note again.  Right.  And then it turns out he used to listen to us on his way home every afternoon.  He heard the tree on my house bit a few times.  I go, did that get back to you? 
[03:11:30]  He goes, what did he say?  He said, yeah, it blew up.  Oh, yeah, it blew up.  That's great.  Yeah, he does that.  He's going to be just fine.  I swear guys could turn us.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  I have nothing bad to say about that guy now.  That was hilarious.  And he had the balls to call not knowing if we were going to just, you know, be complete dicks.  I also thought it was interesting that he said he got to have four people on the websites.  Oh, my God.  He was trying to deal with everything.  Trying to deal with all the influx of shit that was going on. 
[03:12:00]  Now, imagine that when he said he had four or five people running the websites during Jocktober.  Yeah.  Okay.  That hashtag, the Todd Show, has been going five days strong.  That's more than anything we've done in Jocktober.  How many people they have over there trying to squash this.  Hey, if you, it's going to sound a little weird, but fuck it.  If you guys enjoyed what just happened, the hashtag is the Todd Show, but write Team Scott.  Right.  I want to fucking flood that hashtag. 
[03:12:30]  I mean, we could double the hashtag.  Hashtag the Todd Show, hashtag Team Scott.  Right.  Yeah, just make, yeah, put that as a hashtag.  Like, as you're...  Because how great would it be if the Todd Show started trending, but right under it, Team  Scott was trending.  Team Scott.  I don't care now.  I have no desire to, like, you know, find bad audio of that guy.  Nope.  None.  I got emails earlier, like I was saying, that people over at CBS were thoroughly enjoying  our Todd Show coverage as well.  But then he calls, he has the balls to call, and then he fucking delivers and hits a fucking 
[03:13:00]  home run.  And now on our phone, let's say hi to Terry Clifford, who's on our phone lines right now.  No?  What?  Oh, she could turn me in minutes.  Do you think Todd could turn you?  No.  Probably not, huh?  What if he broadcasts here?  Oh, because he's such a, you know what he is, he just comes off as a douche.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No.  No.  Not really.  Because that was the second turn you guys took just this week. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  Isaac.  Isaac.  Isaac turned, you guys.  Yeah.  Mandela.  I mean, Ted Lange.  When fucking Colin pulled that one out.  Wow.  What a way to end a week.  That's great.  Good for Scott.  Good for Scott.  God, I mean, Monday, I wish him the best.  Yeah, on the golf course, because he doesn't want us to mention his new show.  What the hell is this?  I don't know.  Oh, wait a minute.  What?  What?  Is that one of yours? 
[03:14:00]  No.  Oh, so why are you saying wait a minute?  I thought it was, hold on.  Who is that?  Who is that?  Well, I don't know.  Oh!  Taylor.  Vanderpump Rules!  Vanderpump!  Who is she?  Vanderpump!  I don't...  You want to say hi?  Yeah.  Hi.  Vanderpump!  Vanderpump Rules!  How are you?  I just wanted to say hi.  Just saying hi.  I forgot her name, though.  Shayna.  Hi.  Shayna? 
[03:14:30]  What show are you doing?  No, Vanderpump Rules.  I was just doing Taylor's show, and now I'm just hanging out.  Oh, you're just hanging out?  Yeah.  Nice.  Did you have fun?  How's New York?  I heard you moved to New York.  I love it.  You love it, huh?  Really?  Love it.  And your boyfriend works here, I hear.  See, we know about you.  We know about you.  She's part of Vanderpump Rules after Beverly Hills Housewives.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  New York is the best.  Oh, my God.  Isn't it really?  I'm just being so...  Come on.  Yeah, it is cold.  Look, we've got you on mic.  I can't take it anymore. 
[03:15:00]  Are you guys...  Taylor, are you friends with her?  Yes.  Or you just met today?  No.  No.  This is my bestie.  This is my only girlfriend that I have out here.  Really?  True story.  Yeah.  So when I'm bored, I just invite myself over to her apartment.  Yep.  And we drink water.  Why did you move to New York?  Because now you can't be part of Vanderpump Rules next year.  Well, who's going to say that I'm not going to do something better?  No.  Hence, moving to New York.  Right?  So you might have some irons in the fire, as they say.  Career move.  Nice.  Things are cooking.  Very cool.  How's Lisa to work for? 
[03:15:30]  She's tough.  Yeah.  You know?  See, I know these shows, Anne.  I know these shows.  I know.  I know.  A little bit.  I kind of goof on them a little about it, but it comes in handy when you're walking down  the hall, and he's like, man!  They got hot broads.  Hot broads.  They got hot broads on those shows.  Hey, congrats.  You're a hot broad.  Hot broads.  We just want to say hi.  We're going home.  Fuck this.  Yeah, we're getting out of here.  You guys are still on?  I know, right?  I know.  10.30 now.  Oh, you do?  Why?  Who said?  We start at 6.30. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, I'm so jealous.  A little more sleepy.  You got to, like, work it out.  Early riser, see ya?  We start at 6.30.  Early riser?  I'm an early riser.  Yeah.  Did you get in trouble?  Oh, my.  Did I get in trouble?  You did, right?  Yeah, I got in trouble.  But, I mean.  But that's bullshit.  We smoothed it over.  It was so fun.  We split, what, with Twato?  Yeah, of course.  Did you tell her?  What happened?  Lady Di.  Don't forget about Lady Di and her baby dead.  We had a holiday party, and we invited everybody, because we're  like, nice and hospitable.  They had like an open door.  Like, just come in and do the show. 
[03:16:30]  And we had a lot of crazy people on our show that day.  Crazy people.  So, I said, bring whoever you want.  Bring whoever you want.  And he was like, oh, bring whoever I want?  That's a challenge.  I was like, I can handle anything.  I can handle anyone.  So, he brought over this woman named Lady Di, who was just like a  full-blown alcoholic with like the greasiest hair ever.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  Full-blown alcoholic.  Then, he brought over this woman named, what, Twato?  Sandy Cain is her name.  Sandy Cain.  She's an old peep show performer. 
[03:17:00]  She's about 70, I guess.  She had a green wig on.  Right.  And she smelled like...  Can you show her what...  Oh, my God.  That's terrifying.  Yeah.  I know, I know, I know.  Well, that was the day we dressed her up as pretty serious.  That's like a nightmare.  But show her...  Go to the money shot.  Twato?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Don't look.  You have to see Twato.  You just have to.  What?  What is it?  That's Twato.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  I don't know what it is.  That is a growth.  It's a jellyfish.  Near a very sensitive area.  That's disgusting. 
[03:17:30]  I know it is.  You guys are appalling.  No.  It wasn't me.  I swear it wasn't me.  I didn't even want to do that.  Show her Twato.  And so this woman's car is walking towards me, and I'm like in the corner hiding.  I'm like, please, I don't want to see anything near your vagina.  I don't want to see Twato.  I thought it was like inside her vagina.  Why is it named something?  They named it.  We had a name, Ed.  You never saw Total Recall with Quato, that little thing that comes out?  Wait, I did see Total Recall.  Yeah, it's like a little life thing that comes out of them.  It's Quato, so we figured it was near her vagina, so we call it Twato. 
[03:18:00]  It looked like it's enjoying.  That's clever.  That's why we get the big bucks.  I don't think I'm making any points.  I know.  So she shamed it to me.  But now, the funny thing about that, she says she got that because she was shaving and she cut herself.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Thank you.  No.  Shaving with venereal disease.  Ew.  Now, by the way, now I'm convinced every time I wax or shave that I'm going to get a Twato.  Right.  Yeah, and I think I have a mini Twato. 
[03:18:30]  No.  So, bringing her out, so she was cool enough to get all our crazies on her show around Christmas,  and she got in trouble for it because it's not what her audience is used to.  But who cares?  She had Twato.  Of course she can't bring her onto her show.  Right.  Thank you, Stassi.  Yes.  Yeah.  This is why we're best friends.  I know.  Uh-huh.  No, because our audience is just a little different than your audience, you know.  Just a tad.  Oh, we picked up some interesting listeners from that day.  Oh, good for you.  Oh, yeah.  They're so nice on Twitter.  I just love them.  Oh, no.  All these Twitter people. 
[03:19:00]  Again.  They attack us.  I mean, they're such jerks.  They're such jerks.  They love the show, and then it's just a laundry list of shit that they pour on us.  Twitter people are scary.  They are.  She knows.  She gets it.  Terrifying.  You must get a lot of stalkers, though, right?  No, just a lot of mean people.  Mean?  Just a lot of assholes.  You stay off Twitter, I think.  I try to.  See, I know about you.  I saw the Andy show, the late night Andy show thing, too.  She has the craziest amount of followers, too.  What are you up to on Instagram?  Like 300,000?  Damn.  Almost, yeah. 
[03:19:30]  That's pretty goddamn good.  That's all right.  I got a million.  I know.  Yeah.  How many Instagram followers do you have?  I know.  Exactly.  I got to work out my ass, I guess, to get more followers.  That helps.  Well, it was nice meeting you.  It was nice meeting you, too.  Absolutely.  Very nice meeting you.  I will have nightmares tonight.  Yes.  Look out for...  From Cosmo.  Watch how you shave.  It's very dangerous, apparently.  Ooh.  A little extra kiss blown to young Sam Roberts.  Stassi, of course.  I forgot her name for a second. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's Stassi, yeah.  She's pretty cute.  I actually don't watch a lot of the show.  But she was on, like, the show I do watch.  That girl's very cute.  It was like a crossover.  What, does her boyfriend work here?  Yeah.  Who was she?  I don't know.  The word is she's a bitch.  That's the word on the street.  Word on the street.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah?  She's what they call a mean girl.  Wow.  Well, she looks the part.  Oh, he's your average billionaire.
