<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, along with in-studio guests Jim Norton and Jim Brewer, discussing listener submissions.  A significant portion focuses on the website "Wasted Chicks.com," featuring sexually explicit commentary on the submitted photos of allegedly intoxicated women.  The hosts analyze various images, identifying some as fakes, and engage in crude and sexually charged humor.

The conversation abruptly shifts to a debunked 9/11 hoax photo, supposedly showing someone on the World Trade Center observation deck before the attacks.  The hosts expose its falsehood, transitioning into a discussion about the aftermath of 9/11, the anxieties it caused, and its psychological impact, particularly on New Yorkers. Brewer expresses his post-9/11 anxieties about his family and reveals a newly hardened stance towards potential retaliatory violence.

The show then veers into a discussion about missing vehicles – a tanker truck and a crop duster – leading into racially charged jokes about a man named Hendel in Turks and Caicos. Norton recounts humorous experiences in Turks and Caicos, including encounters with overconfident Navy SEALs and a trapeze accident resulting in an embarrassing genital exposure.

The show incorporates listener calls, including one from an 11-year-old, Gary, who imitates the hosts' style.  A segment discusses a John Lennon tribute, criticizing Kevin Spacey's involvement.  The hosts also share their opinions on Barry Bonds' home run chase, the media's handling of 9/11, and the ongoing search for those responsible for the attacks.  Anthony Cumia's outtakes from Strauss Discount Auto commercials, rife with mispronunciations and profanity, are played.  The show concludes with a segment about Joan Rivers' dog, Spike, and more crude humor.


A subsequent segment begins with a rape analogy used to discuss a Pittsburgh athlete's salary negotiations.  The hosts then graphically describe Joan Rivers' appearance, focusing on her neck, using unflattering comparisons. Opie's "sports curse" and his prediction that Barry Bonds won't hit a home run in a specific game are discussed.

A "bro call" segment features a comedic clip of Tom Brokaw struggling with the word "clock," followed by a fabricated, humorous account of Brokaw's post-9/11 behavior, involving heavy drinking, strip poker with colleagues, and drug use.  Listener calls follow, including one about a man whose girlfriend left him for using the "balloon knot" sexual technique and another whose wife is angry he got Valium instead of going to work. A listener requests a repeat of a "technical virgin" commercial.

Comedian Steven Lynch calls in from Indiana, promoting his upcoming Beacon Theater performance with Opie and Anthony, Jay Mohr, and Mike Dinicola. He discusses his tour, his Midwest experiences, and a song he's written about Osama Bin Laden.  The hosts share a funny picture of a man appearing in various historical photos.  Lynch performs his song "Kill a Kitten."  News stories – one about a moldy object mistaken for a penis and another about women drugging and robbing men – are briefly discussed.  The segment concludes with a call from Dice Clay, whose poor-quality musical performance prompts the hosts' attempts to prematurely end the segment.  Jim Brewer and Jim Norton remain in the studio throughout this segment, and the entire segment is filled with crude jokes and references to sex, drugs, and alcohol.


Another excerpt begins with a profane clip of Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver ranting.  The show then moves to listener calls, including one about planting tomato plants, prompting a sexually suggestive response from Weaver.  The hosts promote their upcoming Beacon Theater show and its pre-party at Paisanos.  Listener dedications to Casey Kasem’s American Top 40 are played, highlighting a caller’s complaints about the show's music transitions.

A significant portion involves a heavily intoxicated brother and sister discussing homemade bongs in graphic detail, including their construction and use. Other callers join, sharing their own experiences with homemade bongs and drug use.  A planned "Stoner Spelling Bee" fails due to the callers' intoxication, but the hosts promise a future show dedicated to the game.  A brief clip from a past "Stoner Spelling Bee" is played.

Audio clips of Orson Welles struggling to record a commercial, filled with arguments and insults towards the engineers, are played. The hosts and Jim Brewer comment on the clips with profanity.  Final listener calls recap humorous or shocking moments from the show.  The broadcast ends with further promotion for their live shows and a sponsor, O2Go oxygenated water.  The segment is filled with extensive profanity and sexually suggestive language.

[00:03:00]  and their panties are showing or  or maybe they're not wearing panties  but they're just wasted  i love those are the best  but then they have the fake um wasted photos where the girl doesn't have the panties on  you ever see the picture of the girl  she's so wasted and um she's laying on the the park bench  yeah  like oh she's just getting a good night's sleep after being out all night  and she's so hammered she didn't make it home  and you could see like you could see the the whales on  oh yeah blue night all the good meaty stuff  because her skirt is hiked up and she doesn't have panties it's such a fake picture and people will email it to you like it's the real thing 
[00:03:30]  i saw a picture of her up on the observation deck of the world  the plane coming toward it which was interesting uh... considering that shot has been around the internet that guy the most famous guy in the world now  you've seen these pictures have you seen it  which one we are going to check this out  at first everyone thought it was it was it was for real we said we went on the air and said it was a fake  immediately  the today show even did something on this picture  and uh... people are still emailing it to us like it's the real thing 
[00:04:00]  what idiots thought that was real  dude let me tell you something this picture  it's a guy on the observation deck  they took a picture of him  and you see the plane in the background  it's like no  like the guy had no clue the plane was coming  don't  he was on the observation deck just getting his photo taken  and in the in the in the distance you see the plane coming  you just stop  and it was sent to us as a real picture people swear it's the real deal  uh... there's so many things that prove that it isn't but  yeah  you got it in 
[00:04:30]  i think i just popped it up  and uh... look at that  too many uh...  too many people hitting it  that happens right  but anyway  see if i can get at this  oh i might have gotten it  the guy's wearing uh... uh...  like a winter coat and a winter hat  so it's  why is there a login?  what do you mean a login?  i come to a page  it's a link off a foundry  and it's it's a login page  with a name and password and stuff  son of a bitch  we missed the boat  all right well you've all seen a picture 
[00:05:00]  and you're now saying the most famous guy alive  did you say alive?  i would say alive  we all know his face  yeah well he's gotta be dead yes  now this guy  he looks like some german tourist  it was funny because people are like  no it's a real picture  meanwhile it's supposed to be september 11th  which was a beautiful day here in new york  it was a very pretty day  and he's wearing like a parka  and a wool hat  they look  and they superimposed this plane in the background  it's supposed to be  him taking a picture on the observation deck  unknowing that this plane is coming 
[00:05:30]  meanwhile the direction of the plane  coming at the building  would have been the second plane  meaning he was standing there on top of the world trade center  after the first plane hit  just like hey snap my picture  i'm up here catching the view  no smoke nothing  isn't the uh...  i do think the observation deck  was the first one hit though  the one without the tower  the one you know the radio tower  was that the first or second building hit the radio tower building  that was the second  then the other one was the observation tower  then that's the right building 
[00:06:00]  it's the correct building  yeah it's a fake picture  some schmuck just standing there  they superimposed the plane  well then the plane was coming from the wrong direction  there's plenty of stuff that just didn't work out  and how would they develop the god damn picture  and how do you not notice when you're taking a photograph  if that was happening  exactly  those are the people that have taken it too far  they smoked way too much pot  they had to quit  look what i read now man  check it out  look at his poor dick  look at him  he's just there

[00:55:30]  media  he was never  kowtowed  to them  he said  some crappy  things though  bro  gotta love  that too  what do you say  what do you say  I don't have  the exact quote  someone  well one of our  listeners will  print it up  on instant  feedback  they couldn't  stand him  in Pittsburgh  they gave him  like 13 million  a year  and he wanted  15 and they  asked him  how he felt  about that  and he goes  I felt like  I just got  raped  wow  you gotta love  that  rape references  always appropriate  especially to  the media  that's a little  rough  he's making  13 and he  feels like  he's getting 
[00:56:00]  raped because  he didn't  make 15  or whatever  someone will  get the exact  quote  daniella  what's up  playing by  I just wanted  to see what  your thoughts  were Joan  Rivers and  Madame  the Ventriloquist  puppet  I mean is there  like a separated  at birth there  or what  that's good  that's real  good  yeah  I saw her  on Home  Shopping Club  and she's just  like a mannequin  yeah she's got  I don't know  what it is  it's so odd  the thing is  you can only  pull up so much  yeah  like that  but they  haven't done  anything to her  neck  so she came  out with all 
[00:56:30]  that diamond  jewelry on  on Regis  this morning  but when she  moved sometimes  you could kind  of peer down  there  yeah  and it was  just like  something out  of the Ark  of the Covenant  a chicken neck  a chicken neck  yeah  it's like the new  character in Star Wars  exactly  looks like a critical  ball mounted on a  scrote  very good  that's great  alright I gotta go  guys  thank you Dan  let me go to Rich  Rich you're next on the 
[00:57:00]  Opie and Anthony  I think Dice killed  Spike  what's up Rich  hey what's up  I just want to  point out  you were trying to  make a point  about the new  cities  finding out about  Opie's sports curse  uh oh  and he's so dead set  against Barry Barnes  making this  you know not  making it  it's a shoe in  it's in the bag  it's in the bag  you just put him  over the top  there's gonna be  history tonight  Astros  versus the Giants  if he hits a home run  tonight I will die  especially against the Astros  because they are pitching 
[00:57:30]  around him big time  are they the ones  maybe he's gonna use  like a big Fred Flintstone  bat or something  but he's gonna do it  my freaking sports curse  is really starting  to get scary  they do that in baseball  I think they pitched  around Ty Cobb  years ago  I think it was  Pike trainer  they wanted to get  a certain record  that year  if they don't like it  they pitch around  you so you don't  break it  that's crap  just you know  pitch him  they're just like  every other job too  as much as you  don't want to face it  even comics  you know  like one guy  and if everyone  can't stand him  everyone's like 
[00:58:00]  yeah  just stand in the  back of the room  for this dick  so those guys  do the same thing  yep  right on  alright  what do you want  to do here  what were we gonna do  we were gonna do  bro call  we were gonna do  bro call  we had the tape  of that  yeah we can do  a little bro call  here  we want to hear  this  alright  Tom Brokaw  was uh  yeah it's 
[00:58:30]  Tom Brokaw  was talking about  um  how he dealt  how he dealt  with the problems  that he uh  had falling asleep  after these  horrific attacks  on the road  listen to what he  had to say  this was on  Conan  this is the actual  yeah listen to this  listen to this  impediment  this is funny  it's amazing  he's an anchorman  adrenaline is a  very strong drug  you know I was  pumped up  and I would go  home and sleep  very little  and wake up  how do you even 
[00:59:00]  get to sleep  if you're obviously  that pumped up  well the first night  I went home  um  I came on the air  at 9  about 9.15  in the morning  with Kate  hold it  if he gets out  there  he went  I came home  about 9  uh oh  that's a clock  he has the hardest  time saying a clock  because he can't  say his L  he's got that  list that people  have where he  can't say L's  it comes out  a lot like this  so a clock  is horrific  for him  so you can hear  him he goes  I got home  about 9  or um 
[00:59:30]  9  or ish  he did something  where he didn't  have to say a clock  but he was gonna  say a clock  he plays around  that list  alright here we go  um  I came on the air  at 9  about 9.15  in the morning  with Kate  hey that's good  9.15  in the morning  9.0  he was going  for a clock  he was going  for a clock  he comes up  9.15 
[01:00:00]  in the morning  even before  he probably  practiced  at 9 o'clock  9 o'clock  9 o'clock  I can't wait  for the big question  oh  someone been laughing  why does this  have to be an L  in his god damn name  he's pissed  at least I can say  Afghanistan  I gotta hear this  again  well the first night  I went home  I came on the air  at 9  about 9.15  in the morning  9 o'clock  9 o'clock  9 o'clock 
[01:00:30]  9 o'clock  was it 9.15  I don't remember  9 o'clock  9 o'clock  9 o'clock  9 o'clock  9 o'clock  was on  Katie and Matt  on the Today Show  and then just stayed on  until about 2 in the morning  went home  and you know  it was fair to say  that I was wired  so I thought  the way to deal with this  is with a big water glass  full of scotch  and  this is a good message  for the young people  out there  good for being honest 
[01:01:00]  yeah I like that  yeah  he just gained respect  he went home  and got blasted  a big water glass  full of scotch  Tom Brodaw  NBC Nightly News  excuse me  I'm a little  out of sorts  I was  up with a big  water glass  full of scotch  last night  with Katie  Katie Kirk  and the other  news crew  from NBC  Nightly News  and we were playing  quarters all night  so yeah  I like to wind down 
[01:01:30]  Katie was getting smashed  because she kept pointing  when we made  the elbow roll  you're only going to  point with your elbow  and then  it got really crazy  when we started playing  Whale's Tale  Whale's Tale  Whale's Tale  Sure  Whale's Tale  Prince of Whale  Prince of Whale  calling number  calling number  and then you know  whatever number  comes up  calling number five 
[01:02:00]  I can't even remember  the game  because I  Tom Brodaw  NBC Nightly News  was hammered  cocked off my ass  as they would say  I didn't get to sleep  until I believe it was  how to be four  four-ish  in the a.m. hour  on the  round 
[01:02:30]  time telling  device  so it was  four  of the device  that has  the big hand  and the  small  tiny hand  where was the  little hand  Tom  the  the  tiny hand  you're right  was on the four  and the big hand  the big hand  was on the one  the one  so it was about  4.05  on the  time  chronographer 
[01:03:00]  device  I pointed  hold on  I pointed  at the clock  hey  you  you pointed  chug  come on Katie  don't push you  out on me  I've seen the  inside of your  colon  is it true  you guys got a  little hammered  and did a little  strip poker  we played some  strip poker  and I tell you  one thing  the cars were  with me that

[01:04:30]  I gave Matt Lauer  a donkey punch  it was wonderful  he seemed to enjoy it  Matt Lauer  Matt the guy  from the morning show  that's right  hey does he hang  yes  the bro can hang  I knew he could  he's an OG  as I like to say  an original gangster  I love it  and then I went  to a box of wine  and it got so late  I just said  out of nowhere  I said  I want to go home

[01:18:30]  all right lynch  what's killer kitten  i'll do this one  for all the animal lovers  since they like gerbil  so much  uh oh  it's a sing-along too  so everybody feel free  to join in  all the bouncing balls  when the game of life  makes you feel like quitting  it helps a lot  if you kill a kitten

[01:19:30]  the law  you can  everybody  kill a kitten  and if you  need yarn  for that scarf  you'll get plenty  when you  kill a kitten  feed it turpentine  or break its spine  crush it with your shoe  as long as you 
[01:20:00]  kill a kitten  kill a kitten  listen up  if the one  you love  isn't quite  as smitten  she'll like you  better when you  kill a kitten  and i'll quote  the bible  cause that's where  it's written  if ye loveth  jesus  she must  kill a kitten  throw him

[01:37:30]  usual sips from a 20 ounce bottle of aura potency fruit punch after he downed about two-thirds of the  bottle he found something in the opaque red drink he called over his 16 year old son manuel  and they all worked together who leaped off the donkey immediately  who also worked at the shop his boss told him that it looked like a penis and to report it to the police  a pathologist with the adams county coroner's office determined it was a three-inch segment of 
[01:38:00]  human penis cleanly cut yeah you know off not you know that the yeah they did a good job when he was  uh i got you circumcised uh authorities don't know whether the body part came from an adult or juvenile  that's a sorry state of affairs right sure it could be a juvenile or an adult asian  well whether it had been taken from a cadaver or a living person they were conducting dna tests on

All right.  Yes!  All right, Amy, we're going to put you on hold.  You're still in the contest.  All right. 
[02:18:00]  It's going to be long.  I'm really sleepy.  So are we after that.  It's open.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go ask yourself, Uncle.  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks, man.  We appreciate that.  I want to thank Jim Brewer for stopping by today.  I just need to hang and get some good giggles.  Thanks for letting me hang. 
[02:18:30]  We're just going for some chuckles.  Chuckles.  This is a distraction.  Working out the kinks.  We have not forgotten what has happened.  He's trying to tickle a few ribs.  That's off.  This guy's got a pretty ingenious way to make a bong.  What's that?  You take a milk carton, right?  Yeah.  I guess a container, a milk container.  And you cut it in half.  We're cutting like the bottom off.  I've seen this, yeah.  And you cover the mouthpiece, the top, with foil.  And you poke some holes in it. 
[02:19:00]  Then you put your weed on there, right?  Now you lower this cut-in-half milk carton, because the bottom's now, you know, it's not covered.  It's a hole in the bottom, into a bucket of water, right?  Wow.  You got me so far?  I got you so far.  Lower it in.  Now, as you slowly pull the milk carton up out of the water, you're lighting your weed.  Now the empty space, as you pull it up, is filling up with the smoke.  You got me?  Because of the water pressure there, the difference.  So it fills up the container with smoke. 
[02:19:30]  Now, right, the gravity bomb.  Now, you take the foil off, put your mouth over it, now slowly push it back into the water.  The water now takes up the space, pushes the whole big hit into your mouth and lungs.  Sticky knew exactly what you were talking about.  Those things are disgusting.  They give you, like, the cream cheese smoke.  It's so thick.  The cream cheese smoke.  That's great.  Cream cheese smoke.  Dude, the best bong.  Nice and thick. 
[02:20:00]  The best bong, and it's hard to find.  But what you do is, you dig up Chandra Levy, and you put your mouth on her mouth, and  then you pack her balloon up with skunkweed.  I haven't heard the inappropriate bell in about four weeks.  Thank you, Martin.  We needed to bring the inappropriate bell back to the show.  The gravity bomb.  All the elements of the radio show coming back, thank God. 
[02:20:30]  Melissa, what's up?  Melissa.  Yo.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  How are you?  Wow, you sound stoned.  But you guys are so funny.  I couldn't get control.  You're just stoned.  What do you like?  What kind of, you like rolling the dupe beast, or you like the pipe, the bong?  Only sometimes.  I prefer the bong, but I broke mine recently.  I always liked joints.  Yeah.  Very easy.  They are nice.  And I always like.  They're stinky.  They're nice. 
[02:21:00]  But, you know, I get some serious stuff, and you can't roll joints with that.  It'll kill you.  Gravity bong works best with the end of a Pepsi bottle.  You see how thick the smoke is?  It's amazing.  And Vito, it's called a gravity bong, you ass.  Well, we learned that.  Or I learned that.  I didn't know about a gravity bong.  Open.  I didn't know what it was called.  I haven't smoked weed in a long time.  I used to make.  I had this friend, Dave.  Dave Simoleski. 
[02:21:30]  Simo, we'd call him.  Simo.  And he worked at Struthers Industries.  They made, like, a bunch of stuff where they needed these pipes and fittings and compression  fittings and stuff.  He would come over at my house and just go, dude, you've got to see what I made.  He pulls it out.  It's shiny.  It's, like, put together with wrenches.  And he goes, it's called the dragon.  Like, the dragon.  The dragon.  It's a double-bowled bong.  And when you lit it, he goes, dude, I called that because it looks like a dragon ready to 
[02:22:00]  shoot flames out of his nostril.  Like, this is the coolest thing ever.  And then he later made a four-bonged one, called it the castle.  Looked like, you know, the four towers at a castle just burning, you know.  Yeah, it was great.  It was a little harsh.  It's a little harsh.  A little harsh.  Cannonball.  Coming to your cannonball.  Now, take a hit over this one.  Did he make any that didn't revolve around the King Arthur theme? 
[02:22:30]  No, it was the dragon.  But, yeah.  The suit of armor was great.  You actually got in it.  And you put a lighter to your ass.  And whatever weed was in your pocket lit, you got high.  It was great.  I was going to say, Jabberwacky.  Jabberwacky.  The Jabberwacky.  Jabberwacky.  Did anybody have a friend that, yeah.  Was it a Monty Python?  No.  Oh, yeah.  I think so, sure.  Didn't anybody have a friend that grew pot?  Yeah.  My buddy, Bill D'Angelo.  Ant's got growing pot stories out the air. 
[02:23:00]  But was it good?  Really?  I said it.  No, it always.  Hey, Melissa.  The worst pot ever.  Hold on.  Melissa, we're going to have to let you go, okay?  Hey, no problem.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, here's the deal.  Because we didn't think you guys were stoned out there and stuff.  Obviously, you are.  Stoning us.  They underestimated you.  Yeah.  No, we underestimated you.  We underestimated you.  Without a doubt.  So, this is the deal.  I mean, Stoner Spelling Bee is one of our best games ever.  We only break it out every once in a while.  So, to do it now with 20 minutes left in the show, half hour left in the show, it wouldn't  do it justice.  So, Brewer has promised us he'll come back in the very near future. 
[02:23:30]  We're going to figure it out off air.  And we're going to do a whole Stoner Spelling Bee day.  Wow.  We'll even tell you guys what day it is so you can prepare and get your weed.  We'll have the Stoner Olympics.  Yeah, because we're going to look for those special stoners, too.  I mean, the ones that just have that stoner personality.  Right.  So, we'll announce that in the very near future when Brewer can come back.  Because we only do it when Brewer's here.  Opie, World Trade Center guy at the atomic bomb blast on the wacky bridge in Washington 
[02:24:00]  that fell down because it was designed wrong.  Yeah.  And there was one more, yes, in front of the gaping hall on the USS Cole.  Nice.  Turning up everywhere.  You can find those on foundrymusic.com, our underground website, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Or go to opieandanthony.com.  All right.  So, we're not going to do Stoner Spelling Bee, but we will do it very soon.  Anthony, you know what I found?  What?  The Orson Welles thing we started on earlier. 
[02:24:30]  Orson Welles.  We have more Orson Welles outtakes.  In the fjords.  The frozen fjords.  Fish sticks pop up.  Crisp gum coating.  Quatrain.  The quatrain.  Quatrain.  That's...  Wow.  That crap used to scare the audience.  When we look into the 23rd quatrain, we see Orson Welles is a fat son of a bitch.  And quite the prick.  You remember that growing up, Brewer?  No, I wasn't into Orson Welles at all.  No, it was Nostradamus.  Nostradamus.  Oh, then we saw it tomorrow. 
[02:25:00]  It was right.  And it was 1979 or something.  And he narrated it.  Then.  Oh, yeah.  I never remember that.  I was like HBO.  It scared the daylights out of it.  Was it true that...  And it was just huge.  And every statement he made was a question.  He wasn't saying it because I guess they have some kind of legal thing.  It was like,  And is it true that the quatrain said that in the year 1985, way in the future, that the  earth will end with a war with a turbaned man in a blue turban. 
[02:25:30]  But that was 2000.  And they say it will be the year 1995.  Oh, man.  That's right.  Yeah, it was 95.  That's right.  It was 95.  Oh, my God.  They always push that stuff forward.  A man with a blue turban in the year 2000.  A blue turbaned one.  Yes.  And I will be long dead.  A man with a black Yankee hat will slowly drive and crash a wow van.  That's in the 68th quartet.  A man named Earl. 
[02:26:00]  Would that man's name be Earl?  Black like his soul.  We have to play these Orson Welles outtakes.  Earl at 9-0-9-15.  A callback.  Nice.  Very nice.  Callbacks.  Always pleasant.  Always pleasant.  Let's play these clips from Orson Welles trying to record some copy for commercial.  during the twilight of his career.  And he's just being a prick to the poor engineers that are getting minimum wage. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, we'd love to do this.  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire where Mrs. Buckley lives.  Every July, peas grow there.  Do you really mean that?  Yeah, so in other words, I'd start half a second later.  Don't you think you really want to say July over the snow?  Isn't that the fun of it?  If you make it almost when that shell disappears, it'll make money.  I think it's so nice that you see a snow-covered field and say every July, peas grow there. 
[02:27:00]  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire where Mrs. Buckley lives.  Every July, peas grow there.  We aren't even in the fields, you see.  Yeah, we aren't.  We're talking about them growing and she's picked them.  Yeah.  On what?  On in July.  I don't understand you then.  When must, what must be over for July?  When we get out of the snowy field.  Well, I was out.  We were onto a can of peas, a big dish of peas when I said in July.  Oh, man.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:27:30]  Yes, always.  I'm always past that.  You are.  Yes.  Well, that's about what I say in July.  You emphasize a bit in, in July.  Why?  That doesn't make any sense.  He's right here.  Sorry.  There's no known way of saying an English sentence in which you begin a sentence with in and emphasize it.  Get me a jury and show me how you can say in July and I'll go on you.  He was ready to give them the old, uh, the beach. 
[02:28:00]  In July.  Yes, you can.  In July.  No, I think he was right on there.  In July, peas grow there.  You know, instead of in July, peas grow.  It didn't make sense.  I think Orson was right there in his fat, stupid, stupid way.  Get me a jury.  Get me a jury.  And the guy said, if you prove him wrong, I'll give you a hummer, he said.  Right.  That's what he said.  He goes, I'll go, you know, he said south, but he used another one.  Yeah, that was the beep in there.  Uh, we got some more.  It's just idiotic, if you'll forgive me by saying so. 
[02:28:30]  I'm just stupid.  In July, I'd love to know how you emphasize in and in July.  Impossible.  Meaningless.  I think all they were thinking about was that they didn't want to.  He isn't thinking.  Listen, tell me just one last thing.  Yeah?  It was my fault.  I said in July.  If you can leave every July.  You didn't say it.  He said it.  You're a friend.  Every July?  No, you don't really mean every July. 
[02:29:00]  But that's a bad copy.  It's in July.  Of course it's every July.  There's too much directing around here.  Norway.  Fish fingers in Norway.  Thinders, Norway.  We know a certain fjord in Norway.  Near where the cod gather in great shoals.  There, Janst, the Stangeland.  More on the one, that shoals thing.  Could you roll it around very nicely?  Yeah, roll it around and I have no more time.  You don't know what I'm up against.  Because it's full of things that are only correct because they're grammatical. 
[02:29:30]  But they're tough on the ear, you see?  This is a very wearying one.  It's unpleasant to read.  Unrewarding.  Unrewarding?  Because fingers freeze the cod at sea and then add a crumb crisp coating.  Uh, that's tough crumb crisp coating.  I think, no, because of the way it's written, you need to break it up.  Because it's not as conversationally written. 
[02:30:00]  What?  Take crumb out.  Take crumb out.  Good.  Here on the protest is Beef Burgers.  We know a little place in the American Far West  where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and takes...  This is a lot of s**t.  You want one more?  More on...  You missed the first beef, actually, from Beef.  Wait a minute. 
[02:30:30]  You're emphasizing prairie-fed.  But you can't emphasize beef.  That's like he's wanting me to emphasize in before July.  Come on, fellas, you're losing your heads.  I wouldn't direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare.  When you do this, it's impossible.  You did six last year and by far away the best.  And I know the right reading for this is the one I'm giving it.  Hold on a minute.  I spent 20 times more for you people than any other commercial I've ever made.  You are such pests. 
[02:31:00]  Now, what is it you want?  In your depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?  Whatever it is you want, I can't deliver to it.  I just don't see it.  That was absolutely fine.  It really was.  You can't live in work.  There's no money's worth it.  There's no money's worth it.  And he walks out.  This guy directed and starred in arguably the greatest film of all time.  And some schmuck is telling him how to read for peas.  How to read for peas.  And he's there reading for peas, which is the real story.  And they're arguing over the word in.  In, that's crazy. 
[02:31:30]  This is unrewarding.  There he hacks to pieces prairie-fed beef.  They shoot a bolt in his head and hack him.  How do you emphasize bop?  Um, bop.  Bop.  You don't emphasize the bop.  It's what you do, Dice.  I don't understand.  I'm giving the right delivery to bop.  It's bop.  Not bop.  Yam bag.  Now it's mine. 
[02:32:00]  Because I did it.  I did it right the first time.  You say what to who now?  Hey, Crazy Eddie, what's going on?  I'm over here now.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm over here now.  Is Norton there?  Yes, man.  Since you've become a staple on the show, how come we haven't heard from Dice lately?  Cracklin' Rosie, get on board.  He called it yesterday and the day before.  Yeah, we've had Dice on for about four hours this week already.  Oh, my God.  I missed it then.  You missed him.  Good stuff.  I feel like a jerk. 
[02:32:30]  All right, bro.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Steve from Rawway makes the best gravity bongs.  This side of the Mississippi.  I can't talk about gravity bongs.  They're rewarding.  This is not rewarding.  You're pests.  He just, he writes them off as like a cricket.  Poor guy's making like what?  At the time?  Oh, my God.  Three bucks an hour.  Three bucks an hour.  He's got those big, heavy headphones on his head.  Right.  And he's listening to this big, fat, sweaty guy.  I don't know.  You're an ignoramus.  You're a pest. 
[02:33:00]  I love it.  You're a pest.  Three genes from a peasant.  In the icy fjords is where I want to drown your children, you pest.  And see us a falafel sandwich.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The Ron Pope here's pocket fisherman.  It's the best pocket fisherman.  Just the, this guy, yeah, one of the greatest films of all time.  And there he is hawking a burger.  Hawking some meat. 
[02:33:30]  Beef.  What a voice, though.  Beef.  Amazing.  Oh, my God.  Just rattle a building.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Brew, you're killing me.  Thank you.  Listen, two things.  Number one, why do you have to dump out on the going south when he says that?  When, like, I heard this thing like three times and you never had to dump out of that before.  You could say going south and we've always done.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what he actually said.  No, you can't.  You could say I could walk down the stairs, but you can't use that word in context with something else because it's too graphic. 
[02:34:00]  But you've had, you've had it on before, man.  Yeah, well, you know something, times change, laws change.  People focus more energies on certain programs.  Wow, in a couple months?  Well, there's a.  No, no, it was before that.  I'll guarantee you last time we played that, that was beep, too.  Yeah, but, dude, you've got to realize, man, there's kids out there.  No, I heard it, man.  I swear to God, like twice.  Bill, are you, like, related to Orson Welles?  No, not at all.  You're on something that's not that big of a deal. 
[02:34:30]  Why am I being attitude?  Dude, I can tell it.  I can tell it.  I mean, I want everybody to hear what he says.  But I think everyone knows that he was offering the guy, you know, a Hummer.  Treat.  No, of course he was.  But I was just curious about why he can't play it now.  I've given this caller more time than I've given any caller.  And one more thing, going back to stoner trivia or whatever, did you know you can get  a roll on paper if you take the foil out of a pack of cigarettes and rub it a little?  And peel the paper off of it.  And peel the paper right off. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Well, all right, you're a better man than me.  Always good.  Thank you, Bill.  Hey, thanks a lot.  Okay.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll play, what do we learn next?  Why?  Why?  Because that's what we do at the end of the show, Mr. Welles.  I learned you're a pest.  Are you leaving us, Brewer?  No, get a pee.  Oh, I saw you reaching for your bag.  I thought you were leaving.  Brewer has to pee.  In July, Brewer pees.  It's every July.  Every July.  No, that's stupid. 
[02:35:30]  No, it's bad copy.  Crisp.  Crumb crisp coating.  Crumb crisp coating.  My underwear have a crumb crisp coating.  Because I'm fat and can't wash.  I love that, man.  Yeah, we'll play, what did we learn?  And we'll do that next.  Are you bastards ready to rock?  Opie and Anthony.  When you actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Psychotic apes. 
[02:36:00]  Is this for shock factor?  Oh, my God.  Anthony, New York Islanders hockey.  I can't wait.  New York Islanders hockey is back.  That's right.  It's easy.  Are you?  Why did I say back?  It's easy and affordable to get in on the hard-hitting action with all the Islanders have to offer.  That's bad copy.  The Islanders have one of the lowest season ticket prices in New York sports with seats as low as $14.  Lowest?  The lowest.  That's right, Mr. Wells.  And if you can't handle a full season of the fast-paced action, then check out the Islanders Mini Packs. 
[02:36:30]  Whether it's for 21, 14, or 7 games, you'll get the same great seats to the season's best games, all at an affordable price.  I got one of those packages.  Not so you, you are pissed.  To find out what mini plan is convenient for you, give them a call right now.  1-800-882-ISLES.  That's 1-800-882-ISLES.  1-800-882-ISLES.  Or log on to www.newyorkislanders.com.  Mini plan.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:37:00]  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to play What Are We Learning in just a minute or two here.  Yeah.  I want to remind Philadelphia, we're coming to town.  October 17th.  It's a Wednesday.  That's right.  We're spending the whole day there.  The day starts at the WISB studios around noon.  We have to hang with salespeople.  So we're encouraging people to stop by the station. 
[02:37:30]  So we'll have an excuse to leave the sales meeting.  Because we care about our fans, right, Anthony?  Sure.  And then we're going to do the radio show from Philadelphia.  And then right afterward, we're doing a road show at the Electric Factory.  Full-blown road show.  Bringing the whole gang.  Full-blown.  End of the night.  That takes on a whole new meaning these days.  End of the night.  Days of the new.  We'll close it out.  So it's going to be a lot of fun and a very, very busy day. 
[02:38:00]  And I hope you guys come down and hang with us, okay?  Yeah, man.  It's going to be a cool couple of days this Friday and Saturday.  No, no, wait, wait, Jim.  No, no.  We're talking Wednesday, October 17th.  That's like, what, two weeks from yesterday?  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  I apologize.  Why would you Friday and Saturday?  No, no, no.  Because I'm going to be at the brokerage in Belmore, Long Island.  Oh, you whore.  You whore.  You whore.  That's what I thought you guys were talking about.  No shame.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore with AIDS, I would say.  Oh, my God.  Funny and accurate. 
[02:38:30]  Whore.  Whore.  Thank you, Jim.  Whore with AIDS.  Keep listening to this station to win your tickets.  Look at that.  You can just say that.  Generically.  This station.  No, the Philadelphia station.  Listen to one of these fine stations.  No, no, no.  All right.  You want to play What Did We Learn on the O&A Show today?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, by the way, the Naughty Nighty contest has a few snags.  But we're working it out.  Why?  What's the matter? 
[02:39:00]  We're working it out.  Naughty Nighty.  We're going to have a little meeting about that and figure it out.  All right?  That's a great contest, and we got a great prize for that.  Just looking for the ladies to get in their Naughty Nighties and send us pics.  Naughty Nighty.  Hopefully, we'll have the contest worked out so everyone's happy, including the lawyers.  Interesting.  Is that where the problem lies?  Shocking.  Hmm.  I got a new set of bits we can do tomorrow.  Want to tease with one clip.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Remember the Arnold calls?  Yeah.  Arnold.  Yes, how are you?  What is this?  Sergeant Hartman.  Sergeant Hartman.  Gunnery Sergeant Hartman?  Yes.  Gunnery Sergeant Hartman phone calls?  How many we got?  Oh, my God.  I got five.  So we'll play one just to tease?  Oh, a tease.  And we'll play these tomorrow?  This is some good stuff.  I love Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  Hell, yeah.  Happy face, listen.  All right, let's go.  You ready?  Hit it.  Thank you for choosing your 24-hour to the Walmart.  How many I took to call?  What's your name, scumbag? 
[02:40:00]  Excuse me?  What's your name, fat buddy?  This is Walmart.  Well, no s***.  It's Walmart.  I admire your honesty.  What are you looking for?  Do you suck s***?  One, two, three.  Hello?  What's your name, fat buddy?  What's your name?  Walmart Pyle.  Oh, really?  And how are you doing today?  What have we got here?  A s*** comedian.  What's the matter, sir?  Do you suck s***? 
[02:40:30]  Good evening.  Frank's me going to help you, please.  What's your name, scumbag?  Who am I speaking to, sir?  Walmart Pyle.  Huh?  Walmart Pyle.  Okay, what can I do for you?  Do you suck s***?  Okay.  Walmart Pyle.  Oh, that's so great.  And we have five of them?  Oh, yay.  God, is that great.  That rocks.  That can be better than the Arnold Schwarzenegger prank call.  Yeah.  Every sergeant department, always appropriate.  Wow.  How are you? 
[02:41:00]  I'm a police officer.  What's your name, scumbag?  Do we have one of those Arnold Schwarzenegger calls that we can play?  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  The two.  Tony, what's going on?  Ask you a couple of questions.  Brouwer, Norton, you guys rule.  Thanks, buddy.  Dude, I learned Orson Welles is just as bigger whore as Norton.  And one more quickie.  Joan Rivers is one facelift away from farting through her nose.  Later, guys.  I've never heard it put that way before. 
[02:41:30]  What?  Melissa.  Melissa.  Melissa.  Melissa.  I heard the one, you know, one more facelift and she'll have bad breath and a goatee.  And a goatee.  Yeah.  That's a good one, too, Tony.  Nice.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned a veiny handbag is a delicious treat.  Yeah.  Nice.  And wait, do it.  Jim.  Yes.  Where are you playing tomorrow?  No, no, no, no.  You're going to kill our bit.  Hey, guys, what about Feels for Meals?  Any shot for that this year or no?  Feels for Meals.  We're going to have to look into that once again this year.  We've been trying for the last five years to do this bit, and maybe this year the lawyers 
[02:42:00]  will see it our way.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  We'll give the details maybe tomorrow.  See you later.  All right.  Lots to do tomorrow already.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned the World Trade Center guy, always funny.  Always.  Rick brought his whole CD collection today.  Right.  Norton is a whore.  Hey, can I get a pair of tickets to Electric Factory?  No.  No?  Yeah, hold on.  Thanks. 
[02:42:30]  It's all right.  He's from New York.  We're hoping a lot of New Yorkers go to the Philadelphia show.  I'm getting e-mail from people from Boston that are going to be making the road show,  my friend.  And we're going to have to talk to Tim Sabian tomorrow on the show because a lot of people  are pissed that they have to win these tickets.  We should just open the doors and see who shows up.  I agree.  Why not?  Kat, what's going on?  Hey, today I learned that you can make a gravity bomb out of a milk carton.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They've broken down the fences.  It's a free concert.  Don't take the brown acid.  Look at wavy gravy at the first aid tents if you're freaking out. 
[02:43:00]  Go ahead, Kat.  I learned you can make a gravity bomb out of a milk carton and a body cavity bomb out  of Chandra Levy.  Oh, bravo.  Norton rocks.  I love Kat.  Norton definitely rocks.  You know what?  Bruno rocks.  Give me one sec.  Anthony, I think it's really cruel that your new sponsor says, remember foosball in the  middle of the ad.  Yeah, I know.  I think your Lisa Akak is getting paid back for you.  Yeah, she probably is.  Thank you.  All right, Kat.  Thank you.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that Stoneward Chicks will lick it. 
[02:43:30]  Yep.  And I learned that if Norton had any shame, he'd wear a condom and stop passing around what  he has been.  And also that he'll be at the brokerage in Belmar.  Oh, yeah.  Garrett sucks.  Why not Yemen?  You live in the same whorehouse.  Why not Yemen?  Alan, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned that college students hate puddles of age.  I forgot about that.  Very good.  Stinky rule.  Stinky does rule.  Stinky rule.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I learned that if you're going to name a bong, you have to follow the King Arthur theme. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  You suck.  Thanks.  You want to hear one of these Arnold Schwarzenegger prank calls?  Yes, immediately.  I can't wait to hear the other ones tomorrow.  Immediately.  I'm from Ford Realty.  How are you?  I'm fine, thank you.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  And I want to have them answered immediately.  Who's this, Dave?  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Yeah, sure you are.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Well, how about I come over here and I'll whoop your goddamn ass.  How about that shit? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  All right.  You son of a bitch.  That's great, man.  Why don't you call me that?  You got a problem?  Get over here.  Otherwise, get off of the phone and quit being an idiot.  But I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach.  I will buy.  I've heard those hundreds of times.  I've heard that a thousand times.  And they're still funny.  Ian.  Ian.  Ian.  He's in there with Pacino 2, right? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, we played some of the Pacino ones.  Pacino.  Pacino.  We'll have to play all of them tomorrow with the new ones, man.  How are you?  I'm doing well.  Thank you.  Russell.  I learned that Tom Brokaw doesn't like to make left-hand turns.  Hello, cutie pie.  The Blue Velvet writes, today I learned that Jay Moore can only last six seconds.  Dylan.  Eric writes, today on ONA, I learned the Hughes Theory of Motion, H equals WTC2.  For each day after a disaster, the location of said disaster moves one-tenth of a mile closer to wherever Opie is. 
[02:45:30]  Good morning.  Sim from Brooklyn.  Today I learned that Orson Welles knew about Earl of the future.  Hello, cutie pie.  And Fabio writes, it's been an educational show.  Today I learned Norton Vacations at a cancer ward.  Shondra Levy's Balloon Knot is a great place to pack skunkweed for a nice bong head.  Kevin Spacey gargles mule juice.  Botox jokes, always funny.  And, of course, veiny yam bags are a delicious treat.  We're cakes for nothing. 
[02:46:00]  Let's see.  Let's go to Alan.  Hey, Alan, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  All right.  Hey, I learned that you can make a great bong on a Shondra Levy.  How to emphasize bop.  Yep.  And you're cursing.  Hold on.  Oh.  You're cursing, bro, but you did pretty well.  Al, what's up?  Hey, I learned that only Jim Norton can bring back the inappropriate bell. 
[02:46:30]  Yes, finally.  It's about time that's back on the show.  JN.  All right, Al.  Peace.  Thank you.  I think we're just about done.  Jay?  Yeah.  What's up?  Not much.  What did you learn, man?  Well, two things, actually.  Don't wear cut-off shorts when you're doing a trapeze act.  Yeah.  And bop is annoying no matter who does it.  Yeah, that was good.  Right on, Jay.  Bop.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right, we got stuff to give away to everybody.  We're going to give away all ten copies? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  All right, we got ten copies of The Very Best of the Doors, which contain 16 classics and  never-before-seen photos from the doors' personal vaults.  That's not how you spell vaults.  Wow, that's a stress.  V-A-L-U-T-S.  Valutes.  Valutes.  Sure, why not?  The Valutes.  The Very Best of the Doors is available at, through, Earl.  The Very Best of the Doors is available at, through, rhino.com.  We got to get those Valutes.  Your, uh, did so.  Charcoal briquette.  A moulinion. 
[02:47:30]  Simple as this.  If you want a Doors CD, give us a call, and we'll give them out until we run out, okay?  Thanks, Earl.  Norton, thank you.  Good to be.  Brewer.  Thank you.  You and a man, you're coming back soon to play Stoner Spelling Day.  All right.  We're out for another two weeks or so.  All right, right on.  Let's do it.  Good job, Earl.  We're cakes for nothing!  What's the meaning of this slacking off?  Stoner, it's all we need!  Whatever.  The O.P. and Anthony Show, a smorgasbord of idiocy.  The greatest radio that I've ever heard. 
[02:48:00]  Anthony, it's time to sell some water!  Yes.  O2Go!  I know Jim Brewer personally endorses this product.  It's O2Go.  It's the oxygenated distilled water that we talked about last time.  Remember that it has more oxygen in this water.  It's distilled, so it's healthier than regular water.  And then they oxygenate it to make it taste better.  And oxygen, I think, is good for humans.  And enhances the high.  Right.  Oh, there you go.  Enhances the high.  And when you're done with the bottle, you can make a bong on it. 
[02:48:30]  There you go.  What do spacemen need to survive in outer space?  Space?  Oxygen!  Thank you, Norton!  God damn, I was waiting for the correct answer.  I was going to say toothpaste food.  What?  And hang?  No, I think that comes in low on the list.  Oxygen.  Oxygen, yes.  You want water.  You want oxygen.  Oxygen, you want O2Go.  That's right.  It'll replace your coffee to perk you up because it's got oxygen in it.  They need big boots, too.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:49:00]  O2Go!  I think this oxygen thing's going to be a hit, Anthony.  It's going to take off. </pre>
