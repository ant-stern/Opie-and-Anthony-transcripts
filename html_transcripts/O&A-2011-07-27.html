<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, complaining vehemently about their new studio lighting, believing it to be inferior, reused equipment instead of the new fixtures they requested.  They detailed their email exchange with management, highlighting Opie's habit of only reading half of lengthy emails.  This led into a substantial segment dedicated to phone calls.  A caller named Robert threatened to kill his ex-wife, prompting a serious, albeit somewhat darkly humorous, discussion from the hosts and attempts by Anthony to dissuade him. Another caller, Stinky, recounted a bizarre tale of being shot by his ex-wife, followed by consensual sex.  Numerous other callers engaged in abusive and vulgar exchanges with the hosts and Troy, a show staffer, who became a target of particularly harsh verbal attacks.  These calls involved frequent use of offensive language, threats, and sexually explicit content, with the hosts and Jim Norton actively participating in escalating the exchanges. Robert's abrupt hang-up concluded this segment, leaving the hosts speculating about his actions.

The next segment involved a dispute with a caller named Drew from Alabama, centered around the difficulties of the phone screener's job, and  featured copious profanity and homophobic slurs. The conversation circled back to Robert, who disturbingly implied, and then later confirmed (somewhat vaguely), that he had killed his wife. A caller identifying as a federal agent, Donald, offered speculation about Robert's mental state and the possibility of suicide.  Following this unsettling segment, the show transitioned to promotions for a Jim Norton segment and a Racist Gallagher show, both featuring highly offensive jokes.  A brief interview with Jason Priestley, answering only one question, followed.

The hosts then discussed their musical preferences (focusing on Lynyrd Skynyrd), Madonna's appearance and plastic surgery, and announced a live broadcast the next day at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, mentioning appearances by staff members and guests including Kurt Metzger and possibly Bobo.  The conversation returned to plastic surgery, focusing on Shannon Tweed and Gene Simmons, accompanied by lewd commentary about a picture of Tweed. A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a graphic discussion of Opie's unusual sexual habits involving nipple stimulation and his attempts to quit this habit, including extensive detail and vulgar language.  E-Rock, a staff member, was brought in to smell Opie’s body odor. The hosts then discussed their shower habits, including preferred positions and irritation from using shampoo while masturbating, prompting a call to Dr. Steve for a medical explanation. The discussion veered into the history of soap making and anecdotes about using various substances for masturbation. The show concluded this segment with a graphic description of a man with a maggot-infested penis.


The following segment opened with a disgusted yet amused reaction to a graphic online video of a severely infected, maggot-infested penis.  The hosts described the video in detail using extreme vulgarity.  The discussion shifted to the medical use of maggots in wound debridement, with Dr. Steve providing medical context.  This led to a tangent about a caller’s speech impediment, punctuated with crude humor.  The show then played audio from the hosts' Comic-Con experience, including interviews conducted by Jim and Sam, and notably, poorly executed interviews by "Chip," marked by awkward silences, inappropriate comments, and irrelevant details.  They also replayed a Comic-Con encounter with a woman named Cass who aggressively demanded money while mentioning Demetri Martin.  The segment included further discussion of Comic-Con, mentioning encounters with Princess Leia and Boba Fett cosplayers, and a brief mention of gubernatorial candidate Basil Marceau.  Humorous anecdotes about erectile dysfunction from Pat Cooper were also played.

A subsequent segment centered around more audio clips from Chip's Comic-Con interviews, characterized by crude and offensive comments targeting people in wheelchairs and overweight individuals, along with inappropriate and sexually suggestive comments to cosplayers.  The hosts played several clips, reacting with amusement and disgust. The segment included listener-submitted "F.U." messages, filled with highly offensive language, discussion of a lawsuit concerning a cross at the World Trade Center memorial, the death of a member of America, and a lengthy discussion of Amy Winehouse, including playing her music. There was also a brief discussion of Adele, with negative comments about her appearance. The segment concluded with more Chip audio and commentary.  Sam Roberts was identified as being present, presumably in a production role.

The final segment focused on Who Kid’s recent experiences, including a party attended by Jay-Z, and the upcoming Opie and Anthony staff stand-up comedy show at the Hard Rock Cafe. Who Kid recounted his encounter with Jay-Z, the making of a viral camel lip-syncing video, and the subsequent party with Jay-Z and Rihanna, detailing attendees and the atmosphere, including Rihanna's late-night arrival. The conversation touched upon Who Kid's past appearances, including an interview with Ron Artest and a segment mocking Rick Ross. The main focus shifted to the upcoming staff stand-up show, discussing Ron Artest’s previous attempt and the (lack of) preparation by Opie, Anthony, Roland, and Eric.  Accusations of Eric and Roland cheating by seeking material help from Louis C.K., Joel McHale, Dane Cook, and Jimmy Kimmel led to a heated discussion.  The hosts confirmed their participation in the stand-up competition. A clip of a racist Abbot and Costello routine performed by Jim Brewer was also played, and the Ron & Fez interns were briefly interviewed.

[00:02:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still prompting through it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony Radio Show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Good morning.  Hi.  Welcome, welcome, welcome.  One and all.  Welcome, listeners from many years ago.  Welcome, listeners that are just tuning in for the very first time.  That's impossible.  I know.  You've got to think that's impossible. 
[00:04:30]  It's got to be.  There's no one left.  There's no one left in this world.  I think this guy was trying to take a shot at us on Twitter.  Duck.  But in the end, it made me howl.  Oh, I blocked it anyway, but it made me howl.  He writes, catching up on O&A, can't wait for fatty rock jokes,  Jim to want an autograph, and Opie to be pissed off at management.  All right.  Well, then, he's in for a show he's going to enjoy. 
[00:05:00]  I gather.  Jesus.  People really think they have it down, don't they?  Yes, they do.  We've been surprising audiences for half a century.  What?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I don't even say that.  How long have we been doing this?  We do have a light update.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hello, Dolph.  Should we give the quick light update?  Let's just make it quick today.  Yeah.  After all that hullabaloo yesterday.  What?  Hullabaloo.  We did an hour on the lights, right? 
[00:05:30]  The big, huge, oh, my God, I can't see lights that they decided to give us.  It amounted to giant light brights, they look like.  We made it perfectly clear we don't want their stupid lights because it's not what we wanted.  Yeah.  I thought we made that clear.  Yeah.  Long email yesterday talking about the lights and how they're going to work and how we're  going to try this.  And then if you don't like it after that, then we'll try to, man, ah, bah, da, bah.  Yeah, exactly.  And I just wrote back.  I don't have the energy anymore.  I just wrote, okay, we'll see. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  That was my response.  Okay, we'll see.  Hey, all right.  Let's see.  I'm completely blown off the fact that this wasn't what we wanted.  No, not really.  And then I'm talking to Ed right before the show.  I'm like, you know a little bit about lighting.  How could it possibly work?  Yeah.  They're huge spotlights.  Yeah.  And all we wanted was the lights to be redone in the whole studio.  I'm thinking based on.  With maybe some filters or something.  Based on their positioning and put some egg crate filter in front and a color gel slid 
[00:06:30]  in and dim them down, it might work.  I don't know enough about that type of lighting to know if it's going to work.  It's going to throw too many shadows somewhere.  I know what we should do.  We should put them in the floor and do the Billie Jean video.  That's perfect.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  So that's your update.  They just completely blew off the fact that we obviously weren't happy with their lighting 
[00:07:00]  choice because it's because it's not what we want.  They're just walking on a light up when we walk on a light up.  It's great.  I would love that.  The whole hallway should be lit like that.  It should.  Did you get your you get that email on the lights?  No, I don't think I did actually.  I got that.  Thank you.  You would have known.  Trust me.  It was long and involved and it was just like it's sound off.  So I just wrote, OK, all right, we'll see.  What are you what are you supposed to do at that point? 
[00:07:30]  It's not what we wanted.  No, they're giving us something we don't want and try to make it work.  I didn't get that one.  Isn't that our whole career here?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.  We got like about 13 lights above our heads, right?  Yeah.  And then a big one we never turn on because that's because that one's really obnoxious.  That's crazy.  It's just an office fluorescent.  Yeah.  So we told, you know, these guys, whoever they are.  I don't even know if they're management anymore.  That we just want new lights.  Yeah.  And now we have two huge spotlights. 
[00:08:00]  How is that what we said?  We'll make it work.  All right.  We'll try to make it work and we'll see, like you said.  We'll see.  And I was surprised they actually spent money on us.  And then someone, and I fucking hate you for saying this because I think you're right.  And I think it might even be a Howard fan.  Yeah.  He goes, ah, you know what that is.  Those are just leftover lights when they built his amazing studio.  They are.  And it was probably in a storage, you know, facility somewhere.  And when we were bitching about lights, they said, go into that storage facility and just grab anything. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  And I think this guy's right.  I think so, too.  That's the same light that's in every TV studio.  And it's in the studio that, like, Gary uses for the After Howard show.  Right.  You know, when we're walking out and Gary's in that studio.  Yeah.  You could see that same light.  Okay.  One of them is being used in there.  So they didn't just have one of those lights laying around.  So you don't think they spent money on us?  No. 
[00:09:00]  That's stuff they've had already.  Tell what's his name because I forgot his name.  Anthony.  At this point, I forgot his name.  I want to see a receipt for the lights.  Why?  I want to see a purchase order.  Well, what difference does it make where he got them?  The difference is, which I'm starting to figure it out, the reason we're not getting what we wanted  was because they don't have the lights we want in a storage facility somewhere.  Right.  This was the best they could find in the storage facility.  So they're just kind of looking through their old stuff to see what they could get.  Yeah, I want to purchase a receipt. 
[00:09:30]  And if it's a purchase order that's a couple weeks old, that's okay.  Anything past that, I'm going to be very suspicious.  So get the purchase order for tomorrow.  Thank you.  Okay.  See, there should be little spots.  This is track lighting like you would have in a 70s apartment that we have now.  But if they went to like B&H and picked out some nice individual spots, things like that,  just to throw some light in certain areas where you can slide a gel in front of them, 
[00:10:00]  it would be very nice in here.  It would give it a mood, too.  Yeah.  You know?  Like there's a mood to some other studios, some other studio in this building.  But the mood here is just, it's like an office.  It's like fucking, okay.  It's really bad.  I mean, we, whatever, we've done this pretty many times.  But we had a state-of-the-art studio.  Remember how soft that lighting was?  It was nice.  It was perfection. 
[00:10:30]  It was nice.  Perfect.  They'd throw us in this shithole, and we can't even get our lights fixed properly.  We're going to have two spotlights.  They're going to finagle.  Finagle.  I only read half the email, by the way.  Furnagle?  Why would you admit that?  What?  Why would you admit that?  I don't read long emails anymore.  In this world, you should get everything accomplished in 140 characters.  I skim.  You skim?  I skim.  It's a disrespectful thing to announce, you know, without even anybody asking.  I just read half the email, by the way. 
[00:11:00]  I disregarded the rest.  I like making things perfectly clear.  Perfectly clear.  I'm at that point in my life.  When you have an email, and there's one really long paragraph, and then you scroll, and you  see the start of another one, no fucking way I'm done.  Yeah, that's crazy.  I'm done at that point.  Do you think that that's kind of disrespectful to management, to say that I only read half  the email?  Well, yeah, it's usually disrespectful.  On the radio?  It was just going to be the summary of the bullshit that I already read.  If I sent Opie an email, and I was like, hey, I was thinking this and this for the show, 
[00:11:30]  and then I was sitting back in the office, and he said, Sam sent me some stupid email  with an idea for the show.  By the way, I only read half.  I would feel like a complete asshole for even reaching out.  Do you think that's probably demoralizing for the people sending it?  Would you ever send a really long email, though?  No one sends long emails.  I would wrap it up in two sentences.  Unless you're in corporate.  Now they know to send the same length email that they're sending, but get every bit of  information in the beginning.  Exactly.  And then the next half could just be copy-paste off of Wikipedia or something. 
[00:12:00]  No introduction, no politeness.  Yeah.  I bet you the second paragraph wasn't even light information.  It was about how David Banner became the Hulk.  Yeah.  Just copy-paste on something.  Just want to see if you're reading it.  Probably was the greatest thing ever.  Yeah, you're right.  Just to see if I'm reading it.  And I want to thank somebody, and it's not the usual suspects, by the way, who tipped me  off to where they were waiting for me after the show yesterday.  And I did the sweep around this way.  It worked out like a charm. 
[00:12:30]  And this person also told me about another way to get downstairs.  So now we have three options, which I'll tell you about.  Yeah, you've got to let me in on that one.  Because someone, I had to get out of here early yesterday, had a doctor's appointment.  Dude, you left yesterday like it was a prison break.  You fucking, I turn around, it's like, here's fucking God.  Yeah, there's just a poster of Rita Hayworth hanging.  I figured you had it.  I figured Dice would just talk about himself for another 20 minutes.  Oh, believe me.  And I was good. 
[00:13:00]  You have somebody working reconnaissance to make sure that...  No, this person gave it up on his own.  He goes, I know you have somewhere to go, but they're waiting right over there, right  around the corner.  I'm like, thank you so much.  So I went this way.  I had the whole deal yesterday.  And that's probably why I had the really long email.  I had the whole deal yesterday, trying to get the fuck out of here.  By 10.40, I was just like looking at Dice going, we got to go. 
[00:13:30]  And he's like, where are we going?  What are we doing?  He said, the show after this is about to come on.  What show?  Yeah, what show?  I'm like, Ron and Fez.  Meanwhile, I'm like, I know they're on vacation anyway.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  Sam's got to come on for five minutes after 18,000 spots that weren't run during the show.  So then I leave and I get caught in the hall.  Really?  Yeah.  So I had the walk down the hall conversation.  And then I get in the elevator and Kenny was here the whole time. 
[00:14:00]  So I had to walk to the garage, wait for the car, do that.  Got out.  And then there's a construction site going on, on the 48th, right before 2nd Avenue.  And I just want to tell anybody that might be listening that's on that site, I hope there's  a building collapse that fucking kills you all.  I swear to you motherfuckers.  They had me screaming. 
[00:14:30]  A line of cars just stops.  It's, I guess, a truck, a cab, another car in front of me, and then me, and we're dead  stop.  So I actually was exhausted.  I had already left late from here, later than usual because of the dice thing.  So I was kind of in that, I don't give a shit.  I'm going to get home when I get home.  I really have nothing to do.  So I was in that good place.  I wasn't in an angry place when I was driving.  And I made it all the way to 2nd. 
[00:15:00]  Once I make the ride on 2nd, it's a smooth sail into the tunnel.  They decided to do this.  They stopped traffic at this construction site.  They have a giant one of those roll-off dumpsters.  They take a new dumpster and dump it in the street.  Then pick up the full dumpster, drive that a little down the street, and dump that off.  Pick up the new dumpster, put it where the full dumpster was, pick up the full dumpster, 
[00:15:30]  and you know how long this takes?  Oh my god.  And first of all, they're supposed to have two fucking trucks.  One to pull up the old one, one to put in the new one, and get the fuck out of there.  Well, times are tough.  Times are tough.  So if you're not going to do that, lay off the new dumpster, let some cars go,  pick up the old dumpster, the full one, let some cars go, pick up the other one,  and replace, it's a four-step, one-truck thing, that they could let traffic start moving  four times during that thing. 
[00:16:00]  They didn't let them move once.  They kept the fucking roadblock.  How long?  25 fucking minutes, and I'm not exaggerating.  Dude, they closed, we were stuck there for 25 minutes.  Were you at the light?  To where, it was just before the light.  What?  Just before the fucking light.  Is it in front of Fox?  No, no, I'm talking 2nd Avenue.  Oh, I thought you said 6th.  No, 2nd.  Did he say 6th?  No, no, 2nd.  48th and 2nd.  So I'm almost, I'm right the fuck there to make my turn, and I'm fucked.  So now I'm standing, I'm standing on the, I gave him 10 minutes. 
[00:16:30]  10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, I'm standing on the sideboard of my fucking Escalade,  yelling at this guy that's rigging the dumpster for another fucking move,  yelling at him going, lose your fucking arm!  Lose your fucking arm!  I hope the cable snaps and rips your cunt fuck head off!  I was yelling at these guys.  And everyone else is out of their vehicles, like, just out of their cars,  around, talking to the guy, yelling at these construction guys. 
[00:17:00]  So they finally fucking pull this maneuver off,  and as I'm going past, I had the window rolled down,  I looked right at the guy, and I'm rolling by real slow.  I go, fuck your fucking cunt mother, you fucking cocksucker!  And he's, he's looking, smiling, like they're smiling.  I go, yeah, smile, you fucking prick!  And I said, fuck your fucking cunt mother.  And, and, and, and his face, like, got like, what?  What did you just tell me?  And I was like, yeah, fuck you! 
[00:17:30]  And I, I, I, I, like, kind of drove away.  Why wouldn't they, this is what's annoying,  why wouldn't they block the street off from, like,  and make everybody make the right there on third?  Exactly.  And then fucking, or, or the left on third, whatever it is.  It's called the fucking, that's fucking,  I was getting annoyed listening to that.  A detour.  A fucking detour where you have to go around,  I'd be pissed, I'd be like, ah, motherfucker.  But at least I'd get my ass off the second.  At least you have an option, right?  We, they stopped traffic for 25 fucking minutes.  How could they do that while you're there?  I wanted a cop, I wanted anyone to fucking, 
[00:18:00]  to fuck these guys over.  They, so then, that was,  like, the whole, and now I'm driving just,  now I'm pissed.  Right.  Now I'm fucking pissed.  I was in a good place.  I wasn't yelling at anybody.  I was just like, ah, whatever.  I'm, I'm late already, like,  as far as leaving goes, so, ah, whatever.  And then those cocksuckers,  and believe me, I haven't forgotten.  I, I get to pass them when I go home today.  And, and, and, I'm already thinking  what I could heave at them.  What kind of, a cup of something, 
[00:18:30]  I'm gonna have a cup, I'm gonna have a cup.  I want something that stains,  really good.  I'm gonna time the light,  so I can, make sure I make that right turn,  so they can't all chase me with fucking baseball bats.  And I am gonna heave,  a fucking beverage,  at that smiling, savage cocksucker,  that fucked my day yesterday.  I'm, I'm, I'm tense now.  Are you?  Dude, as I'm listening to that,  I'm just getting rageful,  knowing how fucking crazy it was driving me.  Yeah, we've all been through it.  It's, it was insanity. 
[00:19:00]  And we all, uh, talk about my moods.  This is where,  this is where your moods come into play.  Now, how,  this puts you in a fucking tizzy for how long?  It put me in a tizzy until,  it, not,  that's what I do.  I explode,  and then I'm alright.  I still was like,  you motherfucker.  But I,  I think the second I,  I hit the expressway,  there was no traffic,  and I was able to wind it up.  And I saw a motorcycle guy  on the expressway,  uh,  get a ticket,  and he was just an asshole.  Uh,  I, 
[00:19:30]  I was right behind a fucking,  uh,  NYPD,  uh,  traffic cop in an unmarked.  He's in this black fucking charger,  and you could see,  there's antennas on the back and shit,  and you could see his light package  in the rear window,  in the front,  and his tinted windows,  and I'm like,  whoa,  I,  I reigned it way back.  He's ready to turn that shit on.  I'm behind him,  and I'm matching his speed,  and he's a little over the speed,  limit,  and I'm like,  okay,  this is cool.  Uh,  but I guess a bike was pissed off  that traffic was now doing  55 in a 50. 
[00:20:00]  It's 50 speed limit.  Right.  I usually do 70  coming around there,  uh,  but I,  I really look out for cops.  This bike,  between two cars,  and one of the cars  was the fucking unmarked.  Oh,  it takes off.  I'm like,  oh,  and I'm just looking going,  oh,  no,  dude,  no.  The cop fucking  takes position behind him  within,  a quarter mile.  He lit up like a spaceship,  and,  uh,  and pulls this guy over.  I'm like,  oh,  you poor motherfucker. 
[00:20:30]  How fast was he going?  He had to be doing 80.  No kidding.  80 right between  the fucking cop  and another car  in the middle lane.  And you just look like,  oh,  God,  all right.  That sucked for me,  but man,  that guy just,  he just ate it.  He's so getting a ticket.  That's great.  Yeah.  It was an entertaining  fuck drive home yesterday.  Sounds like it.  Yeah,  but I was able to go home,  and then the day was real nice.  Little poolside relaxation,  which was,  uh, 
[00:21:00]  it's such a nice thing  in the summer,  man.  God damn summer fucking rules.  Sucks looking out your window  in the winter  and just looking at shit  that it's like,  well,  I'm not going to see this  for fucking eight months.  Well,  why don't you figure it out?  How?  I don't know.  It's winter.  Can you put something  over the top of it,  or,  I don't know.  I don't want to,  though,  because it's the whole thing.  No,  just for winter.  Do they have any  temporary shit yet?  Yeah,  but it's the whole package.  It's like walking out,  and it's fucking  all lush vegetation,  and it's like warm out  and nice.  It's the whole deal, 
[00:21:30]  you know?  But can't you keep  your pool heated  well into November?  Well,  yeah.  Yeah,  it's a little rough  at that point.  It starts getting  a little fucking cold.  But again,  I don't want to get out  and have it cold.  I want to get out of the pool  and lay down  on the fucking chair  and just fucking like,  ah,  relax.  Right.  It's part of the whole thing.  I am such a summer fucking guy.  I can't stand winter.  Throwing on fucking,  it's so nice  to just throw some shit on  and leave the house.  Right.  Oh,  20 fucking layers 
[00:22:00]  of sweaters  and jackets  and bullshit.  God,  am I annoyed.  Troy seems annoyed.  What's up?  Oh my God.  What's wrong with Troy?  He's losing his mind  inside apparently.  There's a caller  that's called up  that apparently  he doesn't have  anything that Troy  thinks is good  for the show.  Oh no.  And Troy has been  screaming  at this caller  at the top of his lungs  since we started the show  for 15 minutes or so. 
[00:22:30]  Bring Troy in here  to talk to the guy.  Bring Troy in  to talk to the guy.  I mean like,  oh that would be good  to actually have Troy  come in here  and not only scream a call  but not take the call.  Like you told him  to drive off a bridge.  Which guy Troy?  Number one.  Number one.  This guy's a fucking asshole.  Alright,  you can talk to him.  Robert.  What?  This guy,  this jerk off  has been calling  since the show started. 
[00:23:00]  He's like,  I need to talk to Anthony.  I'm like,  you want,  okay,  hang on,  hold.  He wants me  to pull Anthony  out of the studio  while he's broadcasting  to talk to this  fucking jerk off.  Well anything to get me  out of the studio.  So yo,  Robert.  Hey asshole.  You got Anthony.  What the fuck  do you want to say?  Anthony.  Yes sir.  I need your help bro.  Alright.  This guy's good.  What's wrong with him?  Talk away. 
[00:23:30]  I don't know  what to say.  Why wasn't this  called screened?  Back to Troy.  Yes sir.  This guy just  this guy just  keeps talking  and he's like  he doesn't understand  that  Yeah.  You're given the opportunity  to talk to Anthony  you fucking idiot.  Please,  this guy is  people that call  this show  drive me up 
[00:24:00]  a fucking wall.  They don't understand  how this works.  You call  into the show  you say your name  where you're calling from  and what you want to say.  And if they want  to take your call  they will.  Robert,  you stupid fucking idiot.  Don't you call me  a motherfucking  stupid idiot again.  You're a stupid  motherfucking idiot.  What are you going  to do about it Robert?  You motherfuckers.  You're not going  to do shit.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fucking fuck you.  Motherfucker. 
[00:24:30]  You are talking  to Anthony.  You are.  Talk.  Robert.  It's Anthony.  How you doing  my friend?  Hi, Anthony.  So what do you have  for the show  this morning?  It's a little harsh.  I'm fixing to kill  my ex-wife.  What?  Oh, you're fixing  to kill your ex-wife.  Why?  And what do you think  where do you think  that'll get you?  What's the circumstance?  Fill me in.  Give me a little background.  Yeah, we need the story. 
[00:25:00]  I've fucking been  a fool for years.  A fool for years.  In what way?  You've got to elaborate  and kind of do it.  You know, you've got to  be a little concise  here on this show.  And I don't,  I mean,  I don't need  to do this shit.  I know I don't.  I know I don't.  Yeah.  So what are you  aiming to do,  as you say?  What did she do  to you,  first of all?  Hello? 
[00:25:30]  I'm here.  Yeah,  you've got to talk,  though,  and fill us in  on what this whole story is.  Give us some background  on the relationship  and what drove you  to actually,  as you said,  wanting to kill your wife  or ex  or whatever.  Go ahead.  You're on.  Hey, I'm in.  I'm in.  I have a cigarette.  You seem like you've been,  have you been drinking  a little bit, sir?  Huh? 
[00:26:00]  I fucking,  I put her ass  through law school.  I made her  a fucking lawyer.  And  then  when it's all  said and done,  you know,  she says  she doesn't want  to be with me no more.  I can see why.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  Troy,  now.  Troy,  you better  shut the fuck up.  I ain't gonna,  I ain't gonna  play with you no more.  Two birds with one stone, 
[00:26:30]  I say,  as far as Troy Kwan goes.  So,  so you put her  through law school  and she,  she left you.  Yeah.  And now,  what do you think  killing her,  what do you,  where do you think  that'll get you?  Probably not,  nowhere.  No, no,  I bet it'll get you  somewhere.  Like,  prison.  I don't want to go to prison.  Well,  you will.  If,  if you killed 
[00:27:00]  your,  your,  your ex-wife,  you would,  you would go to prison.  This is an easy one.  You've called a radio show.  if a woman  that is a lawyer  is found murdered,  people are gonna put,  you know,  the pieces together.  And they'll figure out,  we already,  you know,  know your name  and everything,  so.  How do I fix this?  You,  you,  you move on with your life.  Get another woman.  Learn from your mistakes.  Don't put the next one  through law school. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  And,  and move on with your life,  you know?  Find a woman like the rest of us have  with no aspirations.  Right.  Low self-esteem.  Low self-esteem.  Yeah.  Understand?  Sir?  I guess.  You can't kill her though.  Yeah,  that's not a good solution.  You can't do that.  You'll just end up in prison,  so you might as well just,  you know,  go off and  find any life  that's better than prison  and you're ahead of the game. 
[00:28:00]  Just do what I do.  Masturbate thinking about her being dead.  That's,  that's acceptable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah,  there's really no recourse,  you know,  for you.  It's,  it's angering,  but,  uh,  what are you gonna do,  you know?  You got me?  I guess.  All right.  What,  what,  how were you gonna kill her,  by the way?  Yeah,  what were you thinking?  I want to choke her there.  You want to choke her?  That's a personal,  uh,  thing. 
[00:28:30]  I watch a lot,  uh,  of,  uh,  programs on,  uh,  murder and forensics  and things like that.  Uh,  choking is very personal.  Yeah.  Man,  that is something,  uh,  you really despise this woman,  huh?  Oh,  you just don't know.  Really?  And you want to wrap your hands around her neck  and just fucking choke the life out of the bitch ring?  Because you can talk to somebody while you're choking them,  you can tell them while you're doing it,  while you're doing it.  You can't tell them when you're shooting them.  Once the bullet's in,  they're done.  Yes.  But as you're choking them,  you can smack their head on the fucking floor.  Yeah,  watch their eyes,  like,  looking, 
[00:29:00]  and then the horror.  Do you,  do you think about the horror in her face  as,  as you would be choking her?  Oh,  I want her to,  I want her to feel hard.  I want her to feel the pain that I feel right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think that would work very well for you,  though,  to tell you the truth.  Did you have a plan?  Dude?  The plan is,  I don't want to do this.  What?  I don't want to do this.  Yeah.  But did you,  did you have a plan,  like,  how you were going to do this? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Have you thought about,  uh,  well,  what were you going to,  like,  uh,  meet her somewhere,  say you're going to meet her?  What,  what was your plan?  I can't kill her.  I can't do it.  No,  you shouldn't do it.  Yeah,  I wouldn't,  you know.  You got kids together or anything?  Yeah.  Oh,  see,  that's even worse,  dude.  Come on.  Yeah,  the kids are going to kind of hate you.  Yeah.  Kids hate when you kill their mommy.  Yeah,  they're not,  uh,  big fans of that.  Yeah.  You know how hard it is encouraging someone to not kill a lawyer? 
[00:30:00]  It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.  I know.  I know.  It's really,  I'm biting my tongue here.  This goes against all instincts.  We care that much about you,  sir.  The sad part about it is,  is,  she's a fucking divorce attorney.  Oh,  boy.  Oh,  wow.  So she knew,  she knew all the things,  right?  She works for the state,  and,  she's,  them judges that deal with, 
[00:30:30]  uh,  yeah.  Hello?  The judge,  the judge,  given out.  Ah,  so she knows,  she knows all the ways to,  uh,  you know,  screw you over,  right?  I've been screwed so bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well,  I want to kill her.  Yeah,  but you,  you,  you can't,  you know that, 
[00:31:00]  right?  All right.  I appreciate it,  man.  All right.  Don't do it,  sir.  Don't kill your wife,  sir.  Yeah.  I,  I,  you know what?  I,  I've,  I've been in situations where it's very angering,  but as time goes by,  you,  you're like,  ah,  that's why I was trying to tell that motherfucker earlier I was talking to.  Oh,  fucking Troy,  he's a fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Well,  you know,  fuck Troy.  Well,  Troy,  Troy doesn't have male-female relationships.  She doesn't understand what can happen with him. 
[00:31:30]  It's just one guy goes one way,  one guy goes the other way,  and that's the end of it.  Hey,  we got a guy that wants to talk to Stinky and,  uh,  I don't know.  Where,  where are you calling from Stinky?  Hey,  buddy,  what's going on?  I'm driving my tour bus through Arkansas this morning.  How y'all doing?  Oh,  what's up?  I know you.  What's going on,  Stinky?  Uh,  you know,  this guy needs to shut the fuck up and quit his goddamn bellyache.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fucking noise making dickhead.  My ex-wife shot me.  She drove me to my head in the hospital, 
[00:32:00]  and I came home and fucked her,  and then kept fucking her for a while.  You whining pussy ass.  Quit that bullshit.  Get off that fucking lawnmower.  Sit down that goddamn beer,  and quit your fucking whining.  How about that?  Fuck you,  you motherfucker.  I'd lay there and laugh at you.  You got nothing,  motherfucker.  Call a different radio show,  and wear them out.  Waste their fucking time.  We'll be done with your fucking ass.  How about that?  Fuck you.  Oh, 
[00:32:30]  wow.  Stinky?  Yes,  sir.  All right.  He told you to fuck yourself.  Well,  you know.  Wait,  did your,  you had a wife shoot you,  and then you,  she drove you to the hospital,  and then when you guys got back to the house,  you had sex with her?  Yeah,  you bet.  That's a real man right there.  Wow.  That's a real man.  Jesus.  Well,  I tell you what,  when you're,  when you're going to string together the right kind of words to drive a woman out of her fucking mind,  make sure there's not a gun sitting on the table in front of her. 
[00:33:00]  Where did she shoot you?  She shot me in the back of my left arm,  spun me around like a fucking top,  and then started crying all the way out of her.  I didn't mean to fucking shoot you.  Oh,  man.  And the fucking cops,  you know,  they called in the minute someone walked in with a gunshot.  Oh,  yeah.  And I've been shot in the back of the arm,  and she's over there bawling,  and he asked me what happened.  I said,  ah,  you know,  I shot myself.  In the back of the arm?  Yeah,  yeah.  Yeah,  he's like,  how'd you do that?  I'm like,  well,  I'm trying to get a trajectory,  and it wasn't happening. 
[00:33:30]  You know,  fuck that pussy ass motherfucker.  Okay.  Coming from you,  that's really a slam.  How do you call a guy with a story like that a pussy motherfucker?  That's a pretty impressive story.  I don't have a story like that.  Yeah.  So,  so what?  You took the hit for your wife,  right?  Did they believe you in the end?  No,  no.  I mean,  he said,  he said,  is that the story we're going to fucking stick with this morning?  I'm like,  yeah,  well,  fucking good enough.  You know,  it's like,  all right,  do what you want to do.  Sticking with that story. 
[00:34:00]  So then they patched you up,  and you went home,  and you had sex with her?  Yeah,  and from then on,  you know what I mean?  I still divorced her,  but we'd get together when things were slow,  you know,  we'd have to eat or something,  and I'd slide the check over to her,  and she'd look at me,  and I'd go,  hey,  who fucking shot who?  Yeah,  it worked out great.  And never any confusion about who shot who.  Yeah.  It's usually,  you usually remember that.  You don't have to go,  was that me that shot you,  or did you shoot me?  Wow.  I'd be at the lake drinking a beer,  and I'd just pull it out,  you know,  and I'd be like,  hey, 
[00:34:30]  who shot who?  Who shot fucking who?  Wow.  That's great.  That's a great story.  All right,  Sticky,  thank you.  Love you guys.  Take care.  Thank you.  All right,  Robert,  stay on the line,  because Bob the Trucker loves you.  Bob!  Hey,  Robert.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Dude,  I was married six and a half years,  separated for three and a half.  I ended up paying $13,000  for six months back child support  that I'd already paid. 
[00:35:00]  So shut your fucking mouth,  put belly aching,  and you know what?  Get over it,  and don't call a fucking radio station  threatening to kill your wife.  I wanted to kill my bitch,  but I never called a damn radio station.  There are a lot of guys  that wanted to kill  a lot of women out there.  That's what we're learning today.  Wow.  That's all I got.  You gotta just,  you just gotta get out of it, man.  Die.  Yeah,  you really do.  Just get out of it.  I've been that mad before,  arguing,  and I know that it's gonna end, 
[00:35:30]  this relationship is gonna end  with me going to jail.  And I ended the relationship.  You have to end the relationship.  You have to.  That's crazy, man.  And Robert,  it's safe to say  you didn't kill your wife yet,  right?  I'm fixing to.  No,  I know,  but I think Anthony  talked you out of it.  You're still fixing to?  You will go.  They will catch you,  you know.  You will go to prison.  It's not,  there's no,  no ifs,  ands,  or buts about it.  I'm not going to prison  for nobody.  But you will go to, 
[00:36:00]  they will catch you?  What,  are you gonna fight it out  with the cops  when they come to get you?  Because they'll know  it's you.  Yeah.  You know?  No,  they won't know it's me.  How do they not know  it's you?  You're on the radio.  If an ex-wife,  even if you weren't  on the radio,  an ex-wife  gets strangled  and she's got  an estranged husband,  first of all,  you're top of the list  instantly  as the guy  that killed her.  And then, 
[00:36:30]  what do you do  about forensics,  an alibi,  you have motive?  I've got perfect alibi.  What kind of alibi  are you looking at?  You got a plan then,  right?  Yeah,  what's the plan?  What's your plan?  That's a good question.  I want to choke  her fucking life out.  Yeah,  but where?  Where are you  going to do this?  I am.  Hello?  No,  you're right.  I ain't got a plan. 
[00:37:00]  That's not a good plan.  You're right.  I ain't got a plan.  Oh,  boy.  All right.  You don't have a plan.  No.  See,  you're just very pissed off  and,  you know,  they'd catch you.  You'd end up in prison  and then your kids  would be all fucked up.  It's just better  to just move along.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  Sucks.  How do you move along?  How do you move along?  It sucks right now.  You move along,  you realize,  you know,  time starts ticking by. 
[00:37:30]  You get involved  with other things,  other people,  and before you know it,  you're not as fucking  unhappy and pissed off  as you were.  When you wanted to,  you know,  choke the bitch,  as you say.  So,  you know,  then you have moved on.  That's how it works.  You know?  A little time,  a little distance.  Check back with us  in six months.  If you still want to  choke the bitch,  do it.  What can I tell you?  Or by 8.30. 
[00:38:00]  Depending if we have  a slow show or not.  Yeah.  You might have to  watch some movies  or some of those  crime shows.  Watch them crime shows.  They're amazing.  They catch everybody.  Always.  Always.  Whenever there's...  TV.  Well,  I don't mean  television shows  like dramas.  I'm talking  the real shows  like Forensic Files  and things like that.  They always catch  the husbands  when they kill  their wives.  It's amazing  how often it happens.  And you're  the number one suspect. 
[00:38:30]  I want to kill her  on the air.  Well,  that's not going to happen.  That would be  a hell of a thing.  You know,  now he's kind of  tempting me  and wetting my chops here.  Yeah,  the series just wants to see  they can get a sponsor  for it.  Maybe we can do it  live at the Hard Rock.  We sure...  Just have your wife  respond RSVP.  Yes!  We sure could use  the press.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Yeah,  I wouldn't...  And how does  a choking work 
[00:39:00]  on the air,  Hope?  Is that good?  Do we tease it?  Do we stop at mid-choke  and come back  to hold the audience  a little?  That's some good questions.  Yeah,  yeah.  I've never had  a mid-show choking.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Everyone wants in now.  Hold on the line there,  Robert.  Hold on for a little bit.  First of all,  I want to start with  the Joker,  one of the regulars.  Joker!  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to call  and volunteer, Robert.  Hey, man.  I'll come  and take care  of your wife for you.  I'll choke her out,  get it over with 
[00:39:30]  for even putting me  in this position,  and we'll throw Troy  in on top of it  for not just leaving you  on hold  and having us  listen to this horseshit.  That's like a bonus.  That's not going to work.  I like the guy.  By the way,  we've got so many crimes  going on here.  This guy is now soliciting  to kill this gentleman's wife.  Yeah.  The other guy is threatening  to kill his wife.  It's fantastic.  I like that we have  a lot of murderers  listening to us.  Yes.  There's a lot of  criminal intent  going on  on this program today. 
[00:40:00]  Three angry people.  Where you want to go next?  There's so many here.  Let's go to Jim  in Riverdale.  Jim?  Jim.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Robert.  Hi.  I got a secret  for you, my friend.  I'm fucking  your wife.  I'm fucking  your wife.  Wrong dick in her  and that pussy.  I walked up to her  and I'm like,  come on the fucker.  Now quiet now, stupid.  It's my turn.  You cannot.  Hey, Tommy, listen. 
[00:40:30]  I bend her over, right?  I make her recite me  habeas corpus Christus  or whatever the fuck  it is from the law book.  And then I put one sock on  and then I give her  an extra stroke  and then I tell her,  make me a nice bone.  Oh, fuck you,  you motherfucker.  And then I sit back  in the bed  and I make  cock-struck  and dick-licking  motherfucker.  It's my turn now.  Fuck you.  This is why  she's leaving you  because you don't  give her a chance.  She says the one thing 
[00:41:00]  she hates about you  the most  is your accent.  Is your accent.  She wants that  East Coast dragon  and that's what she gets.  The underwear dragon.  Do you understand?  The underwear dragon?  How the fuck is that?  The underwear dragon.  It's the new  Bruce Lee movie.  The underwear dragon.  Starring your wife.  Alright, Jim.  Thank you.  There's so many people  that want in.  We gotta go to Drew  in Alabama.  Drew!  I actually had  something for fucking  Troy. 
[00:41:30]  Yes.  Fucking Troy.  Is he in the studio?  Yeah.  Little bitch ass  answering the phone  like a little faggot.  Uh-oh.  Fucking crying  like a little bitch.  Where is Troy?  Right here.  Talk, motherfucker.  Talk.  Talk.  Talk.  What do you got?  What do I got?  You called me,  motherfucker.  Yeah, I'm calling  on the phone  to tell you  that you're  a little pussy, man.  What?  You're fucking  supposed to be  some top-notch  fucking radio guy  now because 
[00:42:00]  you sit there  and you fucking  dance for  some intern's mom  and now everybody's  supposed to respect you?  You're a faggot,  Troy.  Nobody likes you.  Well, thank you  for the call.  Fucking pussy.  Thanks for the call.  Okay, so why am I  fucking still  arguing with you?  You're fucking...  Who's arguing?  I'm not arguing.  Anthony.  Here he is  if you want to see him,  Troy.  Anthony.  Yeah, what's up, sir?  What is on?  Yeah, that's him  right there.  Oh, that's the guy  that's talking?  Yeah, yeah,  that's the guy you're talking. 
[00:42:30]  You're going to look at me.  Come here.  Come here.  I see it.  There's nothing to look at.  There's nothing to look at.  What the fuck is going on today?  Hold on.  The guy who wants to kill  his wife wants to pipe in.  Yes, sir?  Yes, sir?  Yes, sir?  Talk you off there  for a second.  Off the air?  No, I don't talk off the air.  Yeah, we got to make it  all public.  It's got to be on the air, sir.  For the record.  Yes, it's all on the record,  as I say, sir.  It has to be.  It works.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  What were you going to say  off the air?  I assume you could say it  on the air.  Yeah.  No, I may talk to you  off the air.  Yeah, I can't really do that.  I'm sorry.  You got to talk on the air, sir.  Yeah, we don't know  how to talk to people  off the air.  Off the air.  We panic.  I don't talk to my family  on the air or off the air.  Right.  Well, I will say,  if the only thing  keeping this woman alive  is Anthony's words of kindness,  she's on thinner ice  than she knows.  Oh, yeah.  It's some real thin ice.  You couldn't have picked 
[00:43:30]  a less compassionate  horse's ass.  He's fighting the urge  in his own brain right now.  Nah, give a shit.  Let me say hi to Abby,  who's a girl from D.C.  Abby.  Oh, Abby.  Oh, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Abby.  I was in a shit-ass mood yesterday.  Y'all make me smile.  Oh, see.  Thank you.  There you go.  Is this Robert asshole still on?  Sure.  Robert's on the line.  Listen here, motherfucker.  As much as you want  to kill that bitch, 
[00:44:00]  I guarantee she wants  to choke the life out of you.  So you better fucking  watch your ass.  Hmm.  Wow.  Robert?  Can you be at the...  Can you be on a street  car somewhere?  Aren't you...  Can you speak English,  motherfucker?  Can you speak English?  I can't understand  a goddamn word  out of your fucking head.  Open your mouth  because if you're talking,  you're not sucking.  When was the last  time you got a dick talk, 
[00:44:30]  you fucking hillbilly ass?  If you're talking,  you're not sucking.  No, you can't do it twice.  He's intrigued.  What's that fucking point,  you fucking piece of shit?  Fuck you.  I love this guy.  And I love Troy Kwan.  Oh.  Oh, Troy.  Troy, too bad you don't like...  Too bad you don't like girls.  Troy stands right up there.  It's not bad.  I don't know.  She hung up, though.  That's the tease there.  Let's go.  And did Drew finish?  Oh, you went back to Drew?  Yeah, yeah.  Sure. 
[00:45:00]  Sorry, Drew.  I didn't want to lose Abby there.  What's going on, brother?  No, it's cool, man.  That's cool that she likes Troy Kwan.  Every fucking chick  needs a little faggot  in her clique.  Oh!  Wow.  Fucking nice  fucking mohawk  you got there,  Troy Kwan,  you fucking douchey.  Ooh.  Wow.  Why the hate?  Come on, Troy Kwan.  Grab the mic, bitch.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's got the mic.  You're sitting there  in front of fucking pal talk  like a fucking jerk-off.  You know what I mean?  Like, who the fuck are you? 
[00:45:30]  Why yell at me?  I was talking to you.  You know what I mean?  Like, what you're telling me  means nothing to me, dude.  I mean, you're sitting here  calling into a show  sitting on fucking pal talk  like a fucking idiot.  Like, what...  What you say means nothing.  Figure it out, figure it out.  Sort it out in your head.  I just said it.  Non-insulting motherfucker.  You suck.  Okay.  You suck at this, Troy Kwan.  You're a douchebag.  All right.  I gotta give a point to Drew.  Every time I try to call  into the show,  you give me a little shit.  You can't fucking  accept my calls 
[00:46:00]  and catch it through.  You're a faggot, Troy.  Ooh.  It's my fault  that they don't want  to take your call.  And no,  it's not their fault.  It's your fault  for being a faggot  and not fucking conveying  the message.  I convey the message.  If you don't know  how to speak, Drew,  when you call,  you have two seconds  to say your name  and where you're calling from.  You don't know how to say that,  I'm gonna hang up on you.  So, fuck you.  Klaus Van Bulo,  what'd you want to say?  Yeah.  Hey, Klaus Van Bulo.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Troy.  Yes, sir.  What'd you want to say  you're piping in?  Scott Peterson.  Yeah.  Go ahead, OJ. 
[00:46:30]  Well, anyways,  I wanted to say...  No, no, Drew,  hold on.  Well, hold on.  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead, Troy.  No, this is Jim.  Oh, my God.  This is Jim.  The guy who wanted to...  Yes, sir.  I'm right here.  Hold on.  Where'd you go to get help?  I just went to a 12-step...  You mean for drinking and drugging?  Yeah.  A 12-step program.  Let's just say that.  There's plenty of information on them.  They're very easy to find.  I would suggest that.  Yeah, you sound like 
[00:47:00]  you've been drinking, huh?  Yeah, you say you've been  tipping a few back.  Yeah, I'm drunk.  Yeah, I must say.  You never make  really rational decisions  when you're intoxicated.  No one's ever picked up  a fat chick sober.  Yeah.  Hey, hold on one second.  This guy wants in.  Pete on Long Island.  Pete.  Robert.  What?  Just curious as to  why your wife divorced you.  Did she catch you  fucking your sister  in your double-wide trailer? 
[00:47:30]  Oh.  It's not helpful, sir.  Robert.  Oh, you motherfucker.  You motherfucker.  It's all right.  You'll find her  blowing the rest  of the trailer park, too.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  This redneck humor.  Oh, my God.  Wonderful.  How many cars  do you think she takes  on a nightly basis?  Oh, boy.  All right.  I'm trying to keep  from going off here. 
[00:48:00]  What, Robert?  I'm trying to keep  from going off.  Yeah, I know.  You got to control  what's going on.  Yeah, why don't you  sleep it off?  This is good therapy.  The anger you're feeling  for the listeners  that are chiming in  on the phone.  My little fucker.  Yeah, that's, you know,  you should be able  to deal with this stuff.  Yeah, why don't you  sleep it off,  wake up,  and see how you feel?  Well, this is a good  question coming in  from Buffalo.  Donald, go ahead.  You got Robert  on the line.  Hey, Robert.  Just after the wonder,  brother,  you keep wanting  to get off the line 
[00:48:30]  and speak to him  in private.  Did you already kill her?  Hello?  Robert's just hung up.  Robert?  Robert's just hung up.  Oh, my God.  That was not me.  That was a good question,  by the way.  I got to give it to that guy.  Great question.  I got witnesses.  I didn't fucking do  my hang-up bit there.  No, no, no.  That guy who seemed  like he might be 
[00:49:00]  law enforcement  because it sounded  like there were  some radios going on  in the background  asked Robert  and Robert is now gone.  See, I watch all those shows  and I didn't think  to ask him that.  Fuck.  Well, he didn't sound  like he'd already killed her.  To me, whoever asked that,  that was an astute question.  It was.  I wouldn't have thought  to ask that.  Why would he hang up?  Holy shit.  Is it great radio timing  or he killed her?  Yeah.  Well, it's great radio timing  for us, but why the fuck  did the guy just hang up?  Start searching some  fucking trailers in the South. 
[00:49:30]  We got his number.  We can call him back.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, I wrote it down, too.  Oh, just in case.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Why did he hang up  at that moment?  Well, maybe he was busy.  Maybe something came up.  It was a long pause  and then a hang-up.  Yeah.  He had a battery.  Yeah, something like that.  His battery could have  been dead.  Oh, no.  He's been on the phone  for the past hour.  What's your gut feeling at?  What's going on there? 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  Just the guy that's  on a bender?  I never know what to think  on these things.  Yeah, the guy's on a bender.  Would the battery  really die right there?  No.  No.  Yeah, I don't know  why we'd even joke  about that.  That's right there.  The battery died.  He's now chopping it up  and burying it in the yard.  With other things.  Yes, a few doodads.  I can understand  why his phone  would hang itself  listening to that all day.  Wow.  Dude, what's that about?  I don't know.  The guy doesn't like his wife.  Sean NC on Twitter,  he writes,  why is everyone drunk 
[00:50:30]  at 6.30 in the morning?  It really is amazing.  And surprisingly,  it's not Andy, right?  Yeah.  Very surprisingly.  He's no longer picking up.  It goes straight to voice.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Who was that other guy?  Because he hung up, too.  Maybe if that guy  could call back.  I don't know.  Whoever that other guy was  that asked the pertinent question.  I don't know.  I wish I had thought  to ask that.  I know.  Could have ended  that call sooner.  It's a good one. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  What was that about?  Now we got to fucking  deal with detectives again.  I don't have time  for fucking detectives.  Well, Drew's still on the phone.  He's drunk.  Fuck!  Is Drew drunk, too?  That's what people are saying.  The guy with the go-to?  Yeah, yeah.  They're saying he may  have had a few.  Drew.  Dude, first and foremost,  I'm so bad.  I want to tell you  I love this show.  Thank you, sir.  I love this show.  Jimmy, I want to tell you  happy birthday,  even though that's fucking  about eight years overdue. 
[00:51:30]  No, that's all right.  It's still my birthday.  It's my birthday month.  Ah, hey, buddy.  As far as  the Troy Kwan situation goes,  that dude's a faggot.  All right.  Happy birthday,  and Troy Kwan's a faggot.  Troy Kwan,  stop answering the phone calls.  Come here.  I've got a discussion  I want to have with Troy Kwan.  I'm here.  Talk.  Oh, okay.  You're here, buddy.  What's going on, man?  Can I go back 
[00:52:00]  to answering the phones, please?  I do want to say this.  We have destroyed Troy Kwan.  Remember how happy  he used to be?  He was just skipping through life.  The phones just send  my blood pressure  through the fucking roof.  You're probably,  and I have been at this 17 years,  and of course,  Jimmy, a major chunk  of that as well.  Yeah.  I don't know why  I always just say,  and I'm sorry.  Jimmy's been around  for over 10 at this point.  We've gone through,  if I had to guess,  two dozen phone screeners.  Mm-hmm.  At any W,  I remember that 
[00:52:30]  they only survived  maybe four months.  We were going through  three a year.  Yeah.  It is a brutal fucking job.  No one likes it.  And it's turned Troy Kwan  into this nice happy-go-lucky,  I'm loving being on the O&A show  and working for those guys  to, he fucking wants to kill me.  No, don't get it fucked up.  I love working for your show.  I get up at,  Sounds if.  I get up at 3.30 in the morning,  and I'm excited to come in here  and be a part of this show.  Yeah.  But dealing with some of these people  on the phone  makes me feel like Robert.  Shut up. 
[00:53:00]  Where I just want to be homicidal.  Wait, put that on the scoreboard.  Scoreboard.  Drew 2, Troy 0.  Very good use of shit.  Listen, Troy.  Let me guess, let me guess, Drew.  I'm a faggot.  Let me guess I'm a faggot.  Think of something else  to say, Jerkoff.  Oh, you said it, man.  You said it, man.  You said it, man.  Sitting here calling in the show.  You're a faggot.  What do you got, Drew?  Come on.  No, my point was...  No, no, no, my point.  No, my point. 
[00:53:30]  Shut up.  You always fuck with E-Rock  and E-Rock actually does stuff  for the show  and you answer phones.  Yeah.  Callers.  I didn't ask for that  fucking job, asshole.  You think I want to sit back there  and answer the fucking phone?  What?  You think I...  I was like,  hey, can I screen  fucking phone calls?  Hey, dude.  Hey, you're the best  fucking screener  of all time.  Do you want the screener  championship belt?  I do.  I do.  Come here and suck my dick  because I'm a faggot. 
[00:54:00]  Come here and suck my dick, faggot.  I don't know.  Where are you from, Drew?  Where do you live, Drew?  Where do you live, Drew?  Where do you live?  You suck.  Where do you live?  Where do you live?  I live in Alabama.  Oh, okay.  You're the screener, aren't you?  I didn't screen your phone call,  you fucking idiot.  Oh, okay.  Well, Drew from Alabama  is actually from Alabama,  believe it or not,  and it's the screener.  Fucking, I do my job well.  Well, fucking dude,  you don't do your job  fucking good enough.  All right, well,  the boss is hurt  and they'll take it into consideration. 
[00:54:30]  Maybe they'll move me off phones, Drew.  Thank you for the call.  Are your feelings hurt?  No, I don't give a fuck.  Drew, you're a fucking turd  sitting in Alabama  fucking sitting on Pal Talk  calling into the show.  Like, why would I give a fuck  what you think?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Get a fucking life.  Why are you getting angry?  Why are you mad?  You don't give a fuck  what I call you to get.  Because it's fun arguing  with your dumb ass.  I have nothing better to do  at seven o'clock.  I'd rather do this  than go screen phone call,  so keep going. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, you're a piece of shit.  Oh, that hurt my feelings.  You got me, Drew.  You got me.  You got a nice little bro hog going.  Ah, bro hog.  Oh, boy.  You got me.  You got me.  You're funny, dude.  I'm a faggot.  Correct.  Got it.  Got it.  All right, Drew, thank you.  The guy called back  Donald in Buffalo.  Donald.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  That was you that asked Robert  if he already killed his wife? 
[00:55:30]  Yes, I did.  Are you in law enforcement?  Yes, I am.  Yeah, I kind of heard  the radio in the background.  Yeah.  That's a great question.  We were like,  oh, damn, why didn't we ask that?  I thought to ask that.  Oh, no, you didn't check.  Well, just the whole time  I'm listening to that guy talk,  I'm just imagining  he's probably sitting down  in a chair with a beer,  probably sitting in her  severed head or something.  He sounds way, way off.  He wants a heart-to-heart  with somebody.  We need to send a hearse.  Are you a detective? 
[00:56:00]  Gilder.  Say again?  Are you a detective?  No, I'm a federal agent.  Federal, Jesus.  And you just know this shit.  So you're thinking  that maybe he just needs  a heart-to-heart  because of what he just did?  That's what I'm thinking.  He's probably in one of those realms  where he's coming to grips with it  and wants a, like a,  like a last-right kind of thing,  you know, speak to somebody  before he probably offs himself.  Oh, there you go.  That would have been nice  to be on the phone  and hear that.  Probably would have done it 
[00:56:30]  on the phone.  Like, I need to hear that  in my nightmares  for the rest of my life.  Would have been great radio, though.  I do agree.  It would have been.  Wow, if Robert's still listening,  you've got to call us back.  No, I just want to know  what the fuck's going on.  Don't do it, Bob.  Don't kill yourself.  No, we don't want you  to kill yourself.  Of course not.  But that's your gut feeling  on that whole thing, Donald?  It truly is  because it seems extremely weird.  I mean, he knows  how the radio show works.  Obviously, he's a fan.  And he knows  he's not going to 
[00:57:00]  pull somebody off the air  just to talk to him.  Yeah, yeah.  What if he was just  really, really just fucked up?  I mean, it's possible, but...  Why did he hang up?  Why do you want to talk to me?  Why did he hang up?  That's the thing.  Dude, I got fuck control.  I'm not going to lie.  Maybe.  I don't know.  We'll see.  I'll be watching the papers.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Donald, stay in line.  Robert.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Robert, turn down  the radio, please.  Robert?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You're on with Donald.  What's going on, Robert?  I want to talk to Ed.  Ed's right here.  Yeah, I'm right here.  What's up, man?  Hi.  Hey.  I did it.  I don't believe that.  I did it.  Yeah?  When? 
[00:58:00]  Two minutes ago.  I don't think so.  I did it earlier.  I did it earlier.  Really?  Where?  What do I got to do now?  Well, where?  Where'd you do it?  I don't know where the fuck I'm at.  Well, I think you do.  You got a computer.  Yeah.  Yeah?  So, how'd you do it? 
[00:58:30]  You don't want to know.  Well, I kind of want to know.  I want to know some details.  Sure we do.  I'm fixing up.  I'm fixing up.  You're fixing up.  Hey, Robert.  Robert, this is Donald.  Listen to me.  You called up this radio station to get the floor.  You called up because you wanted them to hear what you said.  He's gone, brother.  He's gone.  I don't know what the fuck to think.  I'm not even going to lie.  I think he's bullshitting.  I think he might be beat.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, it's pretty fucking far out there.  Yeah.  All right, boys.  Great radio.  I love it.  Big fan.  Thanks.  All right, Donald.  Thank you.  I'm sure Robert will be calling all morning.  Yeah, I'm sure.  And Troy will be yelling at him in the screening room.  You should just go to sleep, I think.  Yeah, he needs a nap.  He needs a nap.  You're listening, Rob.  Just lay down and go to sleep.  You need a nappy.  Sleep this one off.  Next to your dead wife.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[00:59:30]  How creepy is this?  As our eyes get all foggy.  You never know.  Oh, my God.  She stiffens up and he realizes what he's done.  Oh, boy.  Like, he's in this partial blackout.  Like, he's dozing off and he sees her form there.  Yeah.  And he knows he's killed her, but he's telling himself, I'm just dreaming.  I didn't really do it.  I didn't really do it.  I'll disguise this guy.  Gives a little sleep.  And then he wakes up and realizes.  12 hours later.  Oh, my God.  She hasn't moved.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  She's cold.  Oh, no.  What have I done?  Goddamn.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:00:00]  What have I done?  How many guys are in jail and don't remember what they did?  How fucking awful is that?  Because literally they have to be told what they did.  Jeez.  That's terrible.  All right.  Well, that's a hell of a way to start a show.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  I don't know what the fuck's going on.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I have no idea.  We'll break and bring the funny, I guess.  What do we do?  I don't know.  We fucking play some clips.  We have some fun with the news stories.  No, I mean with this guy.  Oh, we just leave it.  Just leave it alone? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Let it hang there.  See what fucking, see what goes on.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, man.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Coming up on an all new O&A Behind the Laughter.  Comedian Jim Norton opens up about his private life.  So I'm on my stomach and I guess maybe a little goes in and it's really hurting.  I'm like, yeah, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And the work that goes into creating a great joke. 
[01:01:00]  And I just have to keep stopping.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  And she's like, just relax, you're tensing up.  I'm like, of course I am.  Trying to fuck me in the butt.  How does a famous comedian hone his craft?  She's getting annoyed at me.  She's like, just relax.  And I'm like, I'm trying to relax.  And then a little bit of it going, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  I have to shit, I have to shit, I have to shit.  Jim Norton opens his heart.  I'm gonna shit, I'm gonna shit, I'm gonna shit.  And his sphincter.  And then she stopped and I ran into the bathroom because I had farts.  And we all know, farts equal funny.  And I fucking push out like...  Hysterical laughter and soiled bedsheets. 
[01:01:30]  I kept saying, how much is it?  And she's like, not much.  When we go behind the laughter with comedian Jim Norton.  Coming soon to the Apollo Theater.  That's right, the one in Harlem.  It's Racist Gallagher.  It's not your birthday, it's your birthday.  And you're not out of breath, you're out of breath.  That's true.  Oh, oh, if I pick on you guys, it's illegal.  The mustachioed comedian known for smashing watermelons with a big hammer 
[01:02:00]  is now smashing the civil rights movement back to 1955.  Without preconceived ideas of what the f*** are like, you can't do comedy.  You can't do it without prejudice.  His cutting-edge new brand of comedy will have you in stitches.  Or have him in stitches after you shove that stupid wooden mallet up his bony white ass.  Why don't f***s fart?  Because they don't get assholes until they get married.  Ha ha ha ha!  It's Racist Gallagher.  Lies.  Ha ha ha ha! 
[01:02:30]  I'm just being cutting-edge.  I use these across the country.  I know what's funny.  Coming soon to the Apollo Theater.  One night only because, quite frankly, we don't think there's going to be a second night.  I guess that's what black people do.  Ha ha ha ha!  The Opie and Anthony Show presents...  Prawn Time Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get. 
[01:03:00]  Television star and one-time heartthrob, Jason Priestley.  Prime Time Sam Roberts here with Jason Priestley.  Jason, what type of fuel does your car take?  My car takes premium unleaded.  Thank you so much for your time.  All right, you bet.  This has been Prime Time Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good evening. 
[01:03:30]  Hi, this is Penn Jillette.  Hey, this is Tony Clifton.  Hey, this is Russell Peters.  Hi, this is Pat Cooper, and you're listening to the one and only Opie and Anthony.  Hi, this is Tony Clifton.  Why are we playing this? 
[01:04:00]  I like Skinner, but...  Anniversary?  There's better fucking Skinner songs to play.  Oh, it's because they released Sweet Home Alabama 37 years ago.  Maybe that's why this song was chosen.  Sorry, E-Rock.  Point E-Rock.  Wow.  I like this song, but there's better songs.  I like this one.  Give me back my bullets.  I like this one a little better.  I know this is, you know, this is like the basic commercially big hit. 
[01:04:30]  Well, my problem is I play this song on the radio probably 10,000 times.  Yeah, yeah.  A little burnt out.  I like to go a little deeper.  Nah, thank you.  What other Skinner songs do you like?  Skinner, man.  Call Me the Breeze?  That's a good one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like that one.  I don't know.  I'd have to see a list.  It's fucking been years since I've even listened to Skinner.  Skinner, man.  But was that just huge to listen to?  You know what song never got old? 
[01:05:00]  Believe it or not, Freebird.  Oh, no.  When that fucking song comes on the radio,  even though I've played that one a million times in the past,  that thing just doesn't get old.  To me, Stairway to Heaven does get old, and I can't handle it anymore.  But Freebird?  Fuck.  I don't know.  That I'm burnt on.  Freebird?  Yeah, yeah.  You are?  I can't.  There's some songs that come on, and they're so fucking long.  And I've heard them so many times.  I'm just like, I can't sit through this again.  Give me three steps. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Simple Man.  I love fucking Simple Man.  Oh, yeah.  Tuesday's Gone.  I love fucking Tuesday's Gone.  Are you a Skinner fan?  I love Skinner.  You know what's a weird song that I love?  Am I Losing is one of my favorite songs.  Nothing Fancy.  Yes.  And I would say Simple Man, although I love Shinedown's cover of it, too.  Yeah.  Simple Man's a fucking...  Simple Man is a...  Yeah, that's a great song.  Coming Home is a good song.  Hmm.  Yeah.  What about Give Me Back My Bullets?  I like that one, but not as much as the others. 
[01:06:00]  Just love the groove in that.  Yeah.  Anyway, 37 years ago today for Skinner's Sweet Home, Alabama.  Oh, wow.  Ballad of Curtis Lowe is a fucking great tune.  37 fucking years ago.  What?  Jesus Christ.  You all right?  37 years.  That's fucking insane.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Where were you?  Driving.  Yeah.  Yeah, where were you driving?  I don't think...  No, I was driving, but I remember. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah?  I have a vivid memory, a vivid recollection.  Madonna's been around 28 years.  Released her debut album 28 years ago today.  Well, it's awful for 28.  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  She did something to her fucking face, man.  Yeah, they all have that work done.  She's got cheek implants or something.  Yeah, you think they went with that?  I think.  I don't know.  Is it maybe Botox?  Well, the problem is, they just haven't figured out that plastic surgery yet, because these  women get it, and they look okay until they have to make a facial expression. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  And then all hell breaks loose on their face.  It doesn't move properly.  Yeah, it's all, you know, your face is all muscle and shit underneath there, and when  they start fucking with it, and you smile, you can't see the muscle anymore.  Well, God figured out, whoever you believe in, he figured out how all that shit works.  Right.  And then we're fucking with that, and we don't know how all that shit works.  So, I mean, if Madonna never smiles or has any expression on her face, she would look  great.  Yeah.  But as soon as she moves those muscles, holy shit, they start looking like puppets, right? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, that's why you gotta...  Only those jokes.  You gotta skip down and go to Lourdes.  Lourdes is looking...  You gotta go to Lourdes.  How old is Lourdes now?  She's...  I don't know.  14, 15?  She's illegal.  Oh, she still is?  Yeah, but...  But before you know it, they become illegal.  What are you doing?  It's L-O-U-R-D-E-S.  Oh, my God.  Spelling name?  Did you spell it right?  I'm about to get a new picture and that one when she was fucking nine years old, you  sick fuck. 
[01:08:00]  You're calling Sam a sick fuck?  I have those on my phone.  Hey, Lordies.  Yeah, she's gonna be...  Lordies.  She's gonna be something.  Obviously, she has no music, uh, musical talent, huh?  She looks like she had fucking...  She was probably hairy at, like, eight.  Of course.  She's gonna have to be dealing with some hair removal for the rest of her life.  Madonna hair.  Yeah.  I have a question.  Does anybody know where we are for tomorrow?  We have...  I just saw this thing about the broadcast tomorrow.  What do you mean, where? 
[01:08:30]  It's a...  We're broadcasting live Opie and Anthony show, Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  It's before the SiriusXM Celebrity Fantasy Football Draft.  Tomorrow here in New York, 8 to 10 a.m., we're gonna be live.  Yeah.  Um, first come, first serve.  The door's open at 7.  We're gonna have Kurt Metzger, who's a comedian, buddy of ours.  Mm-hmm.  What's that show?  He's on, uh, Ugly Americans, a cartoon.  He's a voice on...  I like that Big A, Bobo, and Stalker Patty are listed as featured.  Featured.  Why are we hurting in the guest department?  And are we doing staff stand-up tomorrow? 
[01:09:00]  I'm hoping...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good, good.  We're doing staff stand-up.  We're gonna have Stalker Patty, I think, sing Rehab in honor of Amy Winehouse.  Yes.  Passing.  I think Big A is gonna do, uh, the top three news stories of the summer.  We kind of figured some stuff out.  Oh, good.  Uh, Bobo, believe it or not, you know, a lot of people love him, a lot of people hate him,  but the fact is, I think, uh, the people at the Hard Rock are gonna want to see Bobo,  so...  Of course.  Bobo better get a bit together immediately, Sam.  He's gotta get a bit.  I know you're his handler.  Yeah, like a, like a, a routine, like a stand-up bit, like, what type... 
[01:09:30]  Oh, fuck, Bobo wants to be a stand-up.  He really does.  Do you want him to...  And he's probably got a lot of material.  Yeah, let's do a stand-up bit with him.  Okay, because we also have, we've got the staff doing stand-up.  Right.  Kenny is supposed to host.  Right.  That's great.  Virus is headlining.  Right.  Wow.  Maybe throw Bobo in as a middle between some of the staff members?  I gotta stop you, because, um, the virus just shook his head, like, no fucking way.  The virus isn't even here. 
[01:10:00]  If the virus wants to come in, he can.  That works well.  You'd welcome a virus appearance?  Yeah, I mean, if he has any objection, he could...  I think we save the virus appearance for tomorrow.  Yeah, I would hope so.  Oh, yeah.  For the headlining, you know, to headline the comedy show, but...  Wait, do we even have people or no?  Huh?  Do we, people know how to respond?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no, we're done.  We're done.  Oh, we are?  Supposedly, they did the right thing.  Is Pat from Monaki showing up?  Pat, you showing up?  Well, I... 
[01:10:30]  Yes, he says he is.  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  Pat's on, like, a guest list, you know.  He doesn't have to RSVP.  No, he's...  He's a good egg.  Yeah, he is.  He's shaped like one.  Sure is.  Let's say hi to Mike in Virginia.  Mikey!  Yo, I was commenting earlier, you guys were mentioning about bad plastic surgery there.  I don't know if you've been watching Family Jewels or not, but Shannon's looking a little  rancid.  She looks good for her age, right?  How old is she?  She's happy in her 50s.  She's got the same thing, man. 
[01:11:00]  She's all right until she starts moving those...  Oh, no.  She's fucking...  Moving that face around.  She's a disastrous old bag.  You think?  Fuck her.  She starts grinning, and it's just...  Yeah, the face just moves in a way you've never seen it move before.  Ugh.  And also, in We Told You So News, Gene Simmons, what?  Proposed to her?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, what a shocker.  Remember?  She walked off a show, and we told everyone this is so fucking fake.  Yeah.  They're pushing their reality show. 
[01:11:30]  Is the news reporting it as a real event?  Come on.  I'm a huge Kiss fan, but I'm calling bullshit on all...  Me too.  It's all bullshit.  That whole series is bullshit.  And you know what's going to happen?  They're going to probably plan the whole...  The whole season's going to be around planning a wedding, and then they're going to do it,  and guaranteed somebody walks away at the altar.  That's going to be the big fucking season finale.  I guarantee that lump of horse shit.  Ugh.  Dumbass show. 
[01:12:00]  Yo, look at this lump of shit.  Lump of shit.  That dumb fat fuck.  Here's a picture of my girl.  Oh, stupid Garner.  Garner.  Tag him and bag him.  Yeah.  I want you to take a look at this piece of shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to want to fall asleep in a...  Yeah.  On...  I can't remember what it's said.  Yeah.  Some of you fall asleep on a fire watch.  Guarantee you would trip out of the bush.  I can guarantee you would trip out of the bush in a body bag. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, Barnes.  He really didn't play games.  What year is that from?  Shannon Tweed naked on top of a guy.  She's fucking sexy, man.  That's pretty sexy, man.  I'm not going to lie to you there, Jimmy.  That's got to be fucking 30 years ago.  84, maybe.  How long ago was this?  That looks like an 84 teen movie type thing or like one of those sexy romp movies.  Yes.  Not quite hardcore.  Fuck, dude.  Oh, wow.  She's juicy, man.  Wow, wow.  Look at her breasts.  There's some older...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, lady.  I'd love to give her a humping.  That's from 2000.  A humping.  Is that really?  That's 11 years ago?  Yeah.  That's 11 years ago.  You could tell, you know...  Oh, those big tits.  You used to say 2000.  It was, you know, just a little time ago.  2000 is 11 years ago now.  2000 was the future.  Aunt likes doing that or having the girls do that.  Having the girls do handstands.  Naked.  Was that her?  Look at how old that picture is.  Look at that guy. 
[01:13:30]  He looks like he belongs on, what, fucking Three's Company.  Yeah, man.  He has that, like, Ted McGinley hair from the fucking 80s.  Yeah.  She was definitely hot in her prime.  I'll give her that.  But now it's, you know, too much time has gone by.  Old lady shit.  I've gotten so bad with needing my nipples played with.  How do I get out of that?  So, hey, my dick won't stay hard unless my nipples are being played with.  It's crazy.  Cut your nipples off.  Opie, that's not the solution I was looking for.  Well, we don't need them.  We connected everything.  We just cut them off and then stitch it together. 
[01:14:00]  But I am wired weird.  Because you don't take your shirt off at the beach anyway, so cut off your nipples.  No, because then I'll just go to diddle them while I'm hitting scar tissue, scar tissue, scar tissue.  Oh.  I hate that I have to diddle them with my bent wrists.  Diddle, diddle, diddle.  With your bent wrists.  Yeah.  Like a T-Rex.  I've gotten so fucking...  I envy you that you don't need that.  Like, this is a turn-on?  The feeling of it.  They are getting hard as I do this to myself, but I don't know what this means.  I discovered it in my mid-twenties while I was jerking off.  Like, I happened to brush my nipples one time and went, oh boy. 
[01:14:30]  Really?  I used to jerk off.  Like, I would have nothing you care about.  I would take my thumb and hold it against my balls tightly.  Like, I would have my hand between my legs and I would just jerk off.  And that pressure against my balls felt good.  Like, my ball vein.  But then I, uh...  The ball vein.  Stop with your technical medical jargon.  Yeah, I don't want to make it all sexy.  But then I hit the nipples and I don't...  I just began to require that.  Hmm.  Like, this...  Not like you're doing it.  You're doing it like...  Obi's doing like a...  I don't know how to do it.  You're doing it like...  I like a real light...  It's like really light. 
[01:15:00]  Like this?  Yeah.  And that turns you on?  It just feels good.  They are getting hard.  Is that turning you on?  I mean, when my nipples get hard?  I don't know.  It just...  I don't know.  I don't like when my nipples get hard, actually.  They feel like...  Look, I'm embarrassed now.  I just got my nipples hard.  What?  Did you know guys' nipples get hard at?  Uh, well...  Yeah, when it's like cold and stuff.  You don't like your nipples licked, Anthony?  No, I'm not a big...  I envy that.  Not a big upper part of the body.  Do you like them pinched hard and stuff? 
[01:15:30]  Not really hard.  I've had them pinched a little hard.  It was kind of sexy, but not really hard.  Nipple clamps?  Any of that shit?  No.  I...  No.  I'm not that far gone.  No.  I envy you guys, though.  You're just normal.  Like that.  Yeah, you know.  We got fucking issues.  You'll get your fucking...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, we're fucking...  But I mean, just to not need your nipples played with...  Can you understand how envious I am?  Do you need your nipples played with?  No.  Sam?  I don't need my nipples played with.  I don't need...  This is tell-the-truth time. 
[01:16:00]  I don't need my nipples played with.  Like, can you just climb...  Like, I can't just climb on and go chest-to-chest and bang like that.  No?  I wish I could.  I'm so far shot, I've jerked off too much.  What the fuck?  I got BO today.  Do you?  I don't like that.  Yeah.  Are you pitting out?  Yeah, man.  Oh, fuck.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  God damn, man.  I don't have any deodorant right now.  I'm gonna get some, uh, dotarant.  Yeah.  I ran out yesterday and, ah, whatever.  Fuck, that smells, man.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  Do we have anybody that can test it?  Does it really smell?  It's... 
[01:16:30]  I don't know.  It's not gonna knock E-Rock over, bro.  Gee, I wonder.  I just wanna...  Come on, E-Rock.  He comes in.  He's coming in.  Boy, he didn't have to ask twice.  He ran right in.  As soon as I said test, his headphones were off and his fucking trousers were tenting.  E-Rock rules.  It's definitely barking on the right side, but not the left.  There he comes.  Oh, that's awesome.  Oh, no.  The left is there.  Yeah, you got both.  E-Rock, just give a quick test, because he...  I hope he says it's not that bad.  It's really not that bad.  No, it's fine. 
[01:17:00]  Well, no, you can smell shit, though, right?  Yeah, but it's not...  Yeah.  That's not...  E-Rock's a good test.  Well, he's not homeless.  I did shower this morning, so it's whatever happened.  I have to.  I'm a greasy mess.  I never showered before the radio.  I just don't...  No, no, the night before.  Night before, guy.  You don't got beautiful hair like me.  I mean, when I wake up in the morning, it's greasy.  Greasy.  No, it's got to be the night before.  I couldn't fucking wake up that early and start fucking moving around like that. 
[01:17:30]  It's a two-minute shower.  A shower's like fucking aerobics.  Jesus.  Your arms are up.  You're going.  You're shampooing.  Then you're going to wash.  You're doing things.  It's too early to move around like that.  How do you stand in the shower?  On my head.  What's that?  Crazy.  Fill that asshole up with water.  But no, I'm saying, do you have a position that you stand in in the shower?  Like when you zone out under hot water.  I like to zone out under hot water.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have a red light in my shower.  Oh, nice.  It's fucking really great in my shower. 
[01:18:00]  You can chill out.  Yeah, but do you have a way you stand or do you just kind of stand there with your arms  at your sides?  I can't have the water just hitting my face too long.  Even though that's a good feeling, but having hot water run over your shoulders like that  and just stand there like, kind of hunch your shoulders over, yeah, and just put your head  down.  Yeah.  That, I could stand there for fucking hours.  Is that womb shit like, the way people, I got the microphone above me and pointing down  and I'll stand there like this.  I just kind of stand there like that.  Like, it's really weird. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, wait, wait, you put your arms crossed like I'm dead over my chest.  Over your chest?  I lean forward and I allow it to hit the top left part of my shoulder and kind of wash  over me.  You're a fucking weirdo.  I love that.  You really are, too.  I literally, for an hour, will stand like that.  I love to stand like that.  You just do very different things.  That is like, what is, and only hitting one side?  No, no, no, no.  I all get, you have to stand one way or the other.  I'm getting, my whole body is getting it.  I just prefer it on the left side.  But I can take it on the right side of the shoulder. 
[01:19:00]  Like, symmetrical, that, that, I'm into the symmetry of the whole thing.  It's got to hit the back of the neck and roll over the shoulders, like, very symmetrically.  It hits me, when it hits me the back of my neck, it hits the back of my neck, it does  go over my entire shoulders.  But I can just stand there.  There's something about that warm fucking water hitting the back of your neck.  Yeah, I see.  So you like it on the back of your neck, too.  So, it's a weird place to like it.  That's instinct.  Yeah, water, cum, whatever.  Whatever, warm.  I think your arms folded isn't too weird because, you know. 
[01:19:30]  It's comfortable.  It's a little warmer that way.  You keep warm.  Yeah.  The shower is weird.  As soon as you're outside that water, even though you're still in the vicinity of all  that water and warmth, you get cold.  You got to have your radiant, heated floor.  That's why showering with someone in general just sucks.  You need a double shower.  You need a lot of, like, spigots.  You need a big shower, a lot of spigots.  A lot of spigots.  And you can't share, like, soaps and stuff.  Nothing worse than standing there waiting, just naked.  And you're cold.  Just like, ah, you're done with the shampoo. 
[01:20:00]  Fuck.  One shower head, you get cold.  But there's nothing better than that soapy hand.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking grabbing your dick.  Like, oh, well, now we're showering.  Well, that's a nice how do you do.  There's a fine how do you do.  I don't know if I've ever been jerked off in the shower.  No?  I don't know if I've ever jerked off.  You've never jerked off in the shower?  Yeah, maybe once or twice in my life.  Literally, I'm not a bathroom jerker.  There we go.  What?  It's the boss.  Yes, waving at the boss.  Saying hi to the boss. 
[01:20:30]  Which boss?  The big boss.  MK.  MK just waved at you?  Just said hi.  I gave him a thumbs up.  Did he look in here?  Yeah.  Yeah, he waved at both of us.  I think it was the universal signal for everything all right?  Or get the hell out of the building.  One or the other.  I couldn't.  He's really allowing us to bitching a plane, which scares me.  He's fully out.  That's why we bitch so much, because no one has told us not to.  Usually, it gets to a point.  I'll take you inside.  Where we get the call, we have to march upstairs, and then we get a talking to. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  But for some weird reason, they're just allowing us to bitching a plane a lot.  What is that about?  I'm getting paranoid.  Yeah, right?  What the hell's going on?  I just totally pulled, though, a Pavlov's fucking shock jock, because the second he walked  by and looked, I was like, ah, I'm in trouble!  Right?  I instantly think I'm in big trouble for something, because that's the only time I've ever seen  him.  We had one meeting where we weren't in trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember that uncomfortable in his penthouse office at the top of that building? 
[01:21:30]  I was fired a short time later.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah, I think we were.  He just appears like an apparition, though, and he's getting nervous.  Yes!  Anthony looked, and he was over out the window, and my instincts are just like, hello, boss!  Hello, boss!  Hi, boss!  Hi, boss!  Hi, boss!  How you doing, boss?  Hello, boss!  All's well here, boss.  How are you, boss?  Good.  We're good, boss.  Thanks for coming by, boss.  Take care, boss.  Come on, come on, come on.  Godspeed, boss.  God bless, boss.  Can I help you out, boss?  Do you need anything?  I turned into a worm.  I walked all the way home with him once, and he's actually a really cool guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  I mean, you can never hang out with someone like that, because we're in different, you  know.  We're scum.  Yeah, we're scum, and he makes all the money.  But it was funny, because I'm walking home with him, and then I realize, okay, you got  to separate.  You know what I mean?  Because we already walked for a good 10 minutes, and it was probably half the walk.  You don't want to blow it like you did with Obama.  So I'm like, all right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm like, all right, see you later.  It was good talking to you.  And then like a block later, all of a sudden, I'm stopped, because it's a green light or  whatever. 
[01:22:30]  And I look to my left, and he's there.  I'm like, fuck, how did I blow this?  So then we continued walking, because at that point, he's like, hey, where do you live?  And I told him, and he's like, oh, I'm going that way.  I'm like, I know.  That's why we started walking to begin with.  Oh, jeez.  Wouldn't it have been great if he goes, oh, you live right next to Norton.  I go over there all the time.  He's my buddy.  But something was interrupted there.  You don't jerk off in the shower.  Oh, right.  No, I never really did that.  Patrice has a very funny joke about jerking off in the shower and coming down the drain. 
[01:23:00]  It's one of his older jokes.  One day a baby's going to pop out, like how much he jerks off.  Yeah.  And I always thought when he did that joke, like, I can't relate to jerking off in the  shower.  I just can't fucking do it on the toilet either.  Clean up so easy.  Well, on the toilet.  Of course not.  I guess because I'm an edger and I like to spend a long time, like my feet are all pointed  out and creepy when I'm jerking off.  I was fucking jerking off yesterday looking at the computer and I, for probably 45 minutes  and I could come and I just keep stopping so I can't come.  You should get a kid in your life. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  That'll help you.  Come quick.  No, dude.  That would...  45 minutes?  I don't have 45 minutes for nothing.  But I would just resent the kid.  See, I wouldn't help me not be a pig.  I would resent the kid.  That you can't be doing what you want to do?  Yeah, I would be a shitty parent.  Thank you, Roland.  But in the shower, it's awesome.  You got soaps and shampoos and body fucking washers and the only problem is that when you  take that first pee afterwards, I don't know what the fuck happens with the pee hole.  Maybe we can talk to Dr. Steve about that. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, wow.  You get that...  Fluid.  Yeah, you get the cleaning product that's meant to take the grease out of the hair and it  gets inside the urethra, the urinary tract and it'll cause a little burning, stinging.  He gets better at that every time.  But the skin, the skin that's irritated, if you take that and you liquefy it, you can  make wine out of it.  We're calling him right now because now we need to know the answer.  Because it's a really bizarre thing that happens when you use the shampoos and stuff to whack 
[01:24:30]  off.  That's an irritant.  Oh, it's fucking...  Yeah, it's...  You learn that early on.  Never use soap or shampoo.  Yeah, but it feels so good.  Oh, my God.  But do you remember, you know, you're done in the shower or whatever and, I don't know,  a half hour later, you're now taking your leque and you know it's going to happen?  It's burning.  But you know and you're just like, but I have to go.  And then you do it and just, you know, take the pain for a second or two?  I didn't get the pain pissing.  I got the pain when I was actually in the middle of jerking. 
[01:25:00]  What?  Like the soap got in there.  Right.  And it like swells up around the hole.  And my dick hole looked like it was going, me.  Me.  Me.  Like a bass?  Yeah.  You ever watch a movie, The Sandlot, with the kids and the kid goes, forever.  Forever.  That's what it looks like.  Like it just goes, the bottom part of it goes, me.  It's like in The Sopranos, the singing bass that they had mounted that reminded them of 
[01:25:30]  a big pussy.  Yes.  Your dick looks like the singing bass.  How do you, when you see, when you jerk off in the shower, you got to stand up.  What's wrong with standing up?  Forever.  It's, wow.  It's harder to do for me.  Standing up's cool though, because your legs get a little wobbly.  Yeah.  Which is kind of fun.  Do you take less than 10 minutes to whack off?  Yeah, I could be a speed jerker, or I could take my time. 
[01:26:00]  It depends on what's going on, I guess.  Sometimes I do want to take my time, like anyone else.  And other times, like, yeah, let's fucking rub one out, as we like to say.  Someone's going, a standing jerk with a question mark.  It's like, yeah, there's the standing jerk.  Yeah, I've done it in people over the years.  People have fucking stood up and jerked off.  Standing jerk is pretty common.  I think so.  As a matter of fact.  Dr. Steve, sir, how are you?  I'm all right.  Hi, Dr. Steve.  All right, I got the question today.  So we're talking about jerking off in the shower, right? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, you look around and sometimes you use the soap, you use maybe the shampoo,  or whatever else is in there to kind of loop things up.  And after the fact, in my case, but Ant says it happens to him during the actual jerking  off, let's say for me, after the fact, half hour later, I now have to take a leak.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, it burns like a motherfucker.  Yeah.  And it's not an STD or any of that horse shit, because it goes away by the second piss or whatever.  Yeah.  What is that about? 
[01:27:00]  Well, there's, now, does this only happen when you're doing the standing jerk in the  shower?  Or is it when you're in the tub, too?  It's when you use the shampoo.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right, right.  Because you can be in a bathtub and the same shit happens if you do it that way.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah, well, I've had it where the, just if you, if you piss after jacking, that it burns  anyway.  Oh, fuck, you better get that checked out. 
[01:27:30]  Boy, we're the doctors today.  I don't need no fucking schooling to tell you, you got something going on.  Well, I also think that a lot of times the ejaculate will irritate the urethra.  And when you mix that with soap, your body just has to kind of let it flow and cleanse  that out and get rid of it, a lot of times the fluid will bring out the irritant.  The sad thing is, that was exactly what I was going to say.  That's all right.  Now it's the voice and the diagnosis. 
[01:28:00]  Why does the shampoo irritate your pee hole?  Well, a couple of things.  Shampoo is detergent.  And so basically what it does is it is a mucolytic.  So it will dissolve mucus, but also, you know, grease and oil, all of the things that  are lubing up the inside of your urethra.  So when you use things like soap, which by the way, just personal experience, don't use 
[01:28:30]  shampoo outside of the shower and then forget to wash it off afterward.  Oh, shit.  What happens?  Complete sloughing off of the outside of the shaft of the penis.  Oh, shit.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I was, I guess, 14 when I learned that. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  So what happens with a mucolytic?  Mucolytic.  Yeah, it's a good instrument to play.  I love that.  I love the, how that's, uh, that's what he's telling all his friends.  You know, he got a hooker or something.  Of course he is.  And his fucking penis got all sorts of shit on it.  Oh, so.  I would have loved to have had a hooker at 14.  We didn't have any lubricants that we use shampoo.  Sadly, yes.  That was exactly what it was.  It's like, oh, this stuff's squishy.  I'll try it.  And then, uh.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  But anyway.  Now, Dr. Steve, I'm learning from, uh, some fine young listeners.  A bunch of them, actually.  No burn with conditioner.  Yeah.  Here's the problem with conditioner.  You have to keep applying it, especially in the shower.  It doesn't have the staying power.  No, no.  It's not that clinging, uh, constant loop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're going to keep reapplying the shower.  Or, or what you have to do is stand in front of the stream.  You know, put your back to the stream and then lean your head in the shower. 
[01:30:00]  I like, I like a good 30 weight motor oil.  Right.  Yeah.  Good viscosity.  I like a good, uh, exfoliating soap from Lush.  A pumice, pumice soap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just wrap your, wrap your genitals up with that and your angry fist.  And, uh, you do it dry, of course.  Get one of those soaps with the sand still in it.  Yeah.  Go to town.  I got one from Lush, by the way, a soap, and it leaves a greasy film on me. 
[01:30:30]  I hate it.  Lush soap sucks.  I know we did.  Oh, shit, yo.  Now you're fucking stepping on Jimmy's territory.  Well, Jimmy knows.  We, we went shopping together and we all got our soaps.  It's a, it's a classic O and A bit.  We were in Washington, right?  Georgetown.  And we all like a bunch of faggots, like spent a couple hundred bucks each.  I got like, uh, bath balls and.  Oof.  Did ya?  Yeah.  That means your balls have shrunk because you've been in the water too long.  Jimmy, Jimmy knows what a bath ball is. 
[01:31:00]  I do.  Anthony.  Yes.  What's bath balls?  It's a waste of time is what it is.  No, it's an exploding delight.  Uh, you put it in and it fits.  Like Alka-Seltzer.  Like Alka-Seltzer.  It's a softball Alka-Seltzer, basically.  Wow.  And it just bubbles in there, uh.  I guess.  I don't know what it's supposed to do.  Girls love this shit.  Yeah, girls do it.  All right.  Girls do it.  I fucking take baths every once in a while, Steve.  What could that greasy thing be on the soap?  It leaves a really, like I bought this recently.  It's a big hunk of soap, but it's a film on me.  It was fucking awful. 
[01:31:30]  I had to take it off.  I like, I had to just go back in the shower.  Soap is nothing more than, uh, fat that's been exposed to a strong alkali, and it's through  a process called saponification, and some soaps will leave some of the fat, you know,  they won't go through the whole process, and leave some of the fat unsaponified so  that, uh, uh, it will give you that sort of, uh, you know, skin conditioning thing, and  some people like that.  Who the fuck figured that out? 
[01:32:00]  It's leftover fat.  Okay, so who figured that out, Steve?  Do you know?  Okay, well, I'll tell you, it's kind of mildly interesting.  Back in the day, when...  That's what we aim for on this show.  Mildly, right.  We don't want to raise the bar too high.  That's right.  Did animal sacrifice, or when they cooked, uh, animals over wood, uh, the fat would, would  drip out of the wood, and then, uh, wood ash is a strong alkali, and so it would go through 
[01:32:30]  a process of saponification, which then would, uh, you know, you'd usually do this somewhere  near water or a river, and then it would bubble up down by the river, and people would notice  that it, uh, was cleansing.  Before that, the way people cleaned themselves, like in ancient Egypt, is they'd take, uh,  sand and rub it all over their skin and oil, and, uh, and then scrape it off.  Ugh, it must have stunk. 
[01:33:00]  Ew!  You know how many fucking...  How do you clean your balls with it?  Wouldn't they do it with water?  Clean your balls with sand?  Oh, yeah, they didn't clean themselves with water.  Yeah, why didn't they go to the...  That's awful.  Because oil would take oil off, so the, the advance was that, um, now you've got like,  dissolved like, so there are these fatty acid chains in soap, but there's also a water-soluble  part to the molecule, so when you rub soap on, it takes the grease off your skin, but then  it'll wash off in water, and that was the big advance. 
[01:33:30]  So, uh, oh, Jim, I'm sorry.  No, no, go ahead.  Uh, we saw at that, uh, what was that museum?  The Mewtwo...  Oh, yeah, the Mudder, I think.  The Mudder, Mewter, or whatever it is, museum.  Uh, in Philly, it's a creek.  Yeah.  Sorry, Ken.  No, that's cool.  We saw this, uh, woman, uh, that had been buried near a river that had high alkaline content,  and, uh, the, the fat in her body and the alkaline mixed together, and she literally turned  into soap.  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  Like, her, her body is laying there encased in glass at this horrid museum, and she's  made of fucking soap.  Yep.  And it's a dead body.  That's fucked up.  Yeah, you can, you can make soap out of, uh, human fat, and we saw that in the Fight Club.  Yes, Fight Club, of course.  Yes, yes.  Hey, uh, someone is saying, uh, that they, well, it's Adam, Adam in Wisconsin, never jack  off with toothpaste, tried it as a kid, huge, he writes, ultra bright, mistake.  Oh, God, I heard that.  Huh?  Even worse, Vicks VapoRub. 
[01:34:30]  Well, who would do that?  It looks like Vaseline.  Yeah.  You know, as a desperate kid wanting any type of lube and having no ability to go out and  get it, you would do some things around the house.  There was always hand lotion around.  Uh, really?  Yeah, my mom wasn't into hand lotion, but she was really into Vicks VapoRub.  Oh, VapoRub.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  You put that on your chest.  You get a little warming, and it's not so bad, and then for some reason, after you complete 
[01:35:00]  the transaction, the pain is just absolutely excruciating.  Wow.  What is in Vicks VapoRub that affects your nose?  Eucalyptus, I think, or menthol.  Menthol?  Oh.  Something like that.  Yeah, your cock doesn't cough after that, though, which is good.  Sitting there in your pants.  You know how many years I spent with Vicks VapoRub on my chest because of my sinuses?  As a kid, I used to have that on my chest and under my nose all the time.  Maybe that's the nipple clip.  No, it's in the middle of my chest.  I don't do the chest. 
[01:35:30]  I go right for the nostrils with that shit.  Right in there.  I think I just saw the motherfucking Sway.  I said saw the motherfucking Sway just walking in the motherfucking studio.  I think Sway wants to come in here.  Nothing?  He takes a peek or two every day.  He stopped and was watching Dice yesterday.  Yeah, he was.  Hey, Dr. Steve, do you like your nipples played with?  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of that.  I've been with women that really do, and it's wired directly to the brain and to the center  that releases oxytocin, which is a chemical that engenders trust between people. 
[01:36:00]  And it's the same thing.  It's the same.  Baby.  I got missing tos.  Yeah, oxytocin or something like that.  You could make your toast in the morning or something.  Oh, jeez, Chip.  Right?  What percentage of men do you think like their nipples played with, if you had to guess?  Say that again.  What percentage of men like their nipples played with?  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, maybe, hell, I don't know, half. 
[01:36:30]  Nah, I think it's way lower.  You think it's way lower?  Well.  I don't know.  I don't know.  How do I get out of that, Steve?  Hold on.  I want to get out.  How do I get out of that?  You said it goes to trust, which is probably why there's a mother-child bond during nursing, right?  Exactly right.  And it's one of the ways that mothers bond with their baby when this chemical is released.  The other thing that happens is it's a feedback loop that oxytocin helps milk release, but the oxytocin itself is a chemical in the brain that affects the way that we think. 
[01:37:00]  So there are some people out there that are abusing oxytocin.  They'll have these oxytocin parties where they'll spray the stuff up their nose, and then all of a sudden you love everybody that you're around.  To the drugs?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's also, it's released during that.  I'll be laughing about what.  Oh, what's going on?  I apologize to him ahead of time, but Anthony Hamilton, Ontario writes, 
[01:37:30]  E-Rock is a huge walking bar of soap.  The soap potential there is outstanding.  We can retire, I think, eh?  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry.  I'll glide a eagle.  I'm sorry.  So what does that do for me when I play with my nipples?  That's what it's doing is it's really, well, I mean, it's all stimulated. 
[01:38:00]  You're stimulating your brain, and it's in a rot in a zone, and you like it.  Is that why I relax, though?  It relaxes me.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Can I change that, though, because I'm relying on it too heavily?  Well, like anything else that we rely on too heavily, it's best to back off slowly rather than go cold turkey, you know?  Okay.  Try a finger in the ass or something.  Maybe that'll take the place of the nipple play.  I hope. 
[01:38:30]  I wish.  Have that free hand.  There's certainly nothing dangerous about it and nothing wrong with it, Jim.  I get distracted, though.  It's too much.  Oh, God damn it.  What are you doing, Sam?  Sam.  What are you doing?  Ew, look at that guy's nipples.  God.  Ew, they're too long.  That's probably because he's tugging them all the time.  Ew, he likes nip play.  Dude, his nipples are like fucking three quarters of an inch long.  Oh, God, that's disgusting.  That's fucking horrible.  They look like skin tags. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, fucking God.  You like that, Sam?  No.  Would you suck his man nipple?  No, I wouldn't.  That's horrible.  Those are abnormal, aren't they?  I don't know how you fucking girls do it.  Guys are fucking disgusting.  Holy shit.  Fucking dumb nipple guy.  Fucking.  Ugh.  Oh, have you seen, uh, have you seen maggot penis guy?  Yes, I told them about that.  Oh, God damn it.  What was it like?  What did he have?  I'm going to guess it was a fucking infection from a piercing? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, that was a spring.  He took a spring and screwed it down into his urethra to keep it open.  Why would you do that?  Just to be different, man.  It's catchphrase Wednesday.  I love it.  God damn.  Yeah, but he was probably afraid it wouldn't spring forth into action, right, Steve?  Right, Jeff.  Oh, God.  But wait, I... 
[01:40:00]  So the tissue inside died and the maggots just came and went in there going, oh, this is a tasty treat.  Ah, ah, fuck.  I've seen that.  Can we find that video, maggot penis?  Because you could see them coming out of the top of his dick hole.  Yeah.  Oh, and if he zooms in and you can see him down in there in the urethra.  Oh, fucking A.  God damn it.  That's disgusting.  But how does he...  Somebody zooms to a doctor.  How is he not freaked out or did he know that they were eating the bad tissue?  He had to be a crazy person.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:40:30]  He doesn't even want to screw that.  He was proud of it.  It wasn't like he was going, oh, my God, look, look.  I ain't fucking...  I ain't looking.  Let me see.  I'm not looking.  I'm not looking.  I'm not fucking looking.  I'm putting my hat brim down.  Let me see.  And I'm not fucking looking a minute of this.  Let me see if I can handle this.  I'm not looking in a second of this.  Is this where his penis is split?  No, I'm not looking.  This is shit I can't deal with.  At the very top, there's a spring halfway out.  I get queasy.  No, there's no spring.  This is just a guy with these brown fingers.  What's wrong?  He looks like he has a dog's dick or something. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, there's worms crawling.  Look at it, Sam.  What are you doing?  It's not...  No, this is spring.  If it's the same video.  No, this is a different one.  This is a weird infection.  It's gone.  That was a weird infection.  Weird infection.  That was a horrendous infection.  It did look like a dog's dick.  Like a corkscrew.  A red corkscrew his dick looked like.  I'm looking.  You can't watch that stuff?  No.  You missed a nice pink pussy in the upper right corner, though, Ant.  I don't like it.  They had a nice ad.  Yes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Let me look.  You want to look at the ad and look at the maggots?  I'm not being bamboozled.  Maggot penis, Sam. 
[01:41:30]  No, yeah.  Just look up maggot penis.  It's the first one that comes up.  It says, OMG, man with disgusting infected and swollen maggot infested penis.  Just in case.  Wow.  I'm not looking.  Close the curtains.  We got to close.  I'm not looking.  Yeah, you need to close the curtains.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  With the boss walking the hallways, that'd be great.  That's hard to.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  He's holding it open.  I can't wait.  They're really zipping around in there.  Oh, God. 
[01:42:00]  That's disgusting.  I can't.  That's like a fucking superhighway.  Yeah, those are probably bot fly larvae.  I bet they wish he was blacked at a farther to walk.  Let me ask.  Look at it.  Look at that one.  They do, man.  Yeah, but no one goes.  No, come on.  We got to talk about it on the radio.  Just look at it.  This video was set up.  No one fucking has that.  The guy probably said, fuck it.  I'll do a little video.  That's real.  A little video.  Ah, dude.  That's real.  Yeah, I'm sure he got the maggots from somewhere and said, fuck it.  I'll put him in my pee hole and then do it for later.  It's a spring, though.  That thing is just absolutely embedded in his flesh. 
[01:42:30]  How would he get that out?  You have to go for surgery.  It's like some kind of.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You mean like a fucking molly bolt or something?  Yeah, there's no.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Unscrewing that thing.  Do you think his dick snips?  It stinks?  Oh, God.  Oh, that would be a hard smell.  Sam is not looking.  Come on.  I saw it.  You didn't.  You look at it for a second.  Come on.  Get in there and look.  Sam, you can't look at it.  You're not looking.  Oh, God.  Why did I look?  Fuck.  Shit, I looked.  It's fine.  You can look at that.  No, I can't.  They're all crawling around like the inside of the dick. 
[01:43:00]  That's curiosity always get me.  Because you're a cat.  Now you can look.  That's not that bad.  That's weird.  Oh, yes, it is.  Oh, yes, it is.  There's like probably 12 or 15 maggots inside where the penis flesh is being penetrated by  the metal.  It's just rotting in there.  Yeah.  But how are there so many in there?  How would he get rid of them?  How do you get maggots out of you?  By peeing?  Well, no.  What he has to do is instrumentation out of there and then they'll have to surgically 
[01:43:30]  go in and get rid of all that.  I wonder what...  They'll have to flush it out.  Oh, he just pulled the spring out.  Does he?  I didn't see that part.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I might be a couple seconds ahead.  Oh, you must be.  Spoiler alert.  There he goes.  Spoiler alert.  He's got the maggots on his feet.  I've never actually watched it all the way to the end.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that...  What the fuck?  He pulls the spring out.  We just saw the spring be pulled out of his feet.  Some guys really hate their dicks.  Yeah, I don't get that.  Like, I love my...  Oh, look at them crawling out now. 
[01:44:00]  Sam, look.  Come on.  You got to look.  They're crawling out.  He has a big dickhead, this guy.  Jesus.  Well, it's swollen from infirmation.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.  You know what bothers me about all this is that they all started in Little League.  Yeah.  We all started in Little League as innocent, dopey kids that want to be in the major leagues  or whatever.  And then fast forward a couple decades and you got guys shoving springs in their pee holes.  Something happened at Little League with the coach, if you want to do that.  That is awful. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you let your dick get that?  If I saw one maggot by my dick, I would fucking...  Oh, my God.  You would come.  Of course.  I would literally faint.  I would fall down and faint out of, like, queasiness.  Do you think his dick smells bad in the hole?  Yes.  Oh.  Oh.  Will he lose his dick or can they fix that?  That'll be all right.  Dude, that's beyond anything I've ever experienced in my medical career.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  Maggot in the dick.  I don't know if that can be salvaged or not.  Now, we, you know, we have a lot of wounds that'll come in, like, on someone's leg that  have maggots on them.  And actually, the maggots do a good job of cleaning up the dead tissue and stuff.  Yeah.  What is this, 15, 60?  Occasionally, you'll throw in a couple of bags of maggots and seal them into somebody's wound  just to do that, just to clean it up.  Is that really a practice that's still used in modern medicine? 
[01:45:30]  I haven't seen it, but I hear, I mean, you can still buy sterile maggots, and there are  people who still use that technique.  No, shit.  Now, that's for, when they need to clean.  A wound with, you know, where you want to clean out to the edge before you do something.  Don't they do that to burn victims?  No.  Eat the dead skin.  A burn would be one of those kind of wounds that you could use sterile maggots for, but  it's usually something peripheral, like on a leg or an arm or something like that. 
[01:46:00]  Like, they don't need healthy tissue, right?  Right.  That's exactly right.  Why don't they?  How do they know the difference?  Well, they have chemical receptors, I guess, that detect dead and dying stuff that they can  easily eat and digest.  It's not like they've got teeth, so, you know.  Do they have brains?  They're larvae.  Now, they have nervous systems, but they don't have brains.  It's like some people that work here.  Sirius XM. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, do you think that tickles when they have a wound with maggots crawling around in there?  Oh, yeah, I would think it tickles.  You're just chuckling the whole time.  Oh, my gangrene.  How long do they put them in there for?  Well, the flesh that they're eating is dead, so it doesn't feel anything, but underneath it,  yeah, I'd probably feel a little something moving around.  And they're probably crawling on good tissue to get to the bad stuff.  Yeah, they'll eat down to good tissue.  They don't like that good tissue.  Boy.  Well, it's hard for them to get into their stupid maggot mouth. 
[01:47:00]  Someone's got maggot issues.  Apologize to all maggot Americans.  Wow, man.  Stupid maggot mouth.  How long do they leave the maggots in the wound for?  Because I have seen them do it on shows and stuff.  Yeah, I think it's days to weeks.  That long?  Yeah.  Wow.  Why?  I would have thought it was a few hours.  Because now they take their time.  They don't work really fast. 
[01:47:30]  They're just very meticulous.  So wait, so days to weeks.  Langoliers.  Don't they get...  Right, right.  Just like the Langoliers.  Yes.  Do they get bigger?  What happens to a maggot when they get bigger?  They turn into a fly.  So you have fucking flies under your bandage?  No, you get them out of there before that.  You just wash them out.  And then what happens to them?  Then you flush them down the toilet.  Jimmy wants to know what happens to the little maggot.  Yeah, we're the little guys.  The little maggot that could.  Wait, the maggots take care of you and you don't even allow them to live? 
[01:48:00]  Can you allow them to live after that, Dr. Steve?  Turn into flies.  Fuck them.  All right, open the fucking window.  Let them go.  They just ate human flesh.  Screw them.  Yeah.  Would you put your hand in a bag of maggots?  Oh, yeah.  No problem.  That's easy.  No problem.  Yeah.  I don't know if I could do that.  I was telling a story last week or a couple weeks ago about that.  I had bags full of garbage from the party.  And I left them out back a little too long.  And I went to throw them out.  And I lifted it up. 
[01:48:30]  And maggots came pouring out.  It was just...  I was like, how fucking many...  Eggs are these flies laying.  And apparently it's millions.  Yeah.  And they were all over the place.  I got the bags out.  But enough had fallen off where they were just like...  It looked like rice-a-roni spilt all over my deck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not the maggots that are so gross.  It's just what they represent, which is nasty.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah.  There's something about that.  Because it's like... 
[01:49:00]  An earthworm doesn't freak me out or anything.  And they're a lot grosser if you really think about it.  But it's that whole dead tissue and garbage and fucking...  You know, necrotized flesh.  Oh my God.  Hey, let's go to Dan in Cleveland.  Stay on the line, Dr. Steve.  Dan, what do you got?  Yeah.  I'm just calling...  While you guys are talking about the maggots, look up like a microscopic image of a maggot.  It'll give you fucking nightmares.  Oh, really?  Electronics.  Yeah.  It'll give us what?  It'll give us what, brother?  I didn't hear what you said.  Yeah, we didn't hear you. 
[01:49:30]  Nightmares.  You will have scary dreams.  Nightmares.  Well, I had...  I mean, I don't really get nightmares over stuff like medical stuff.  All I'm saying is that it's awful to look at.  It's a fucking monster.  Is it really?  Okay.  Wait till you find him.  What's...  Wait, wait.  What's so freaky about it that looks weird?  The teeth in the eyes, honestly.  It's all the teeth in the eyes.  Oh my God.  He isn't alive.  Really?  Hold on.  How did you...  Who's the guy in Cleveland?  What's your name?  Yeah, Dan. 
[01:50:00]  What's up?  Dan.  Dan, I'm the same guy that had the Nancy Grace looks like David Bowie.  Dan, I had to step out for a second and take a phone call.  What's this about?  Okay.  I'm hanging up.  I think I'm flunking out.  Bye.  No, no.  Honestly, I didn't hear you.  We're looking at the picture.  I didn't hear you, Dan.  They're awful.  They're scary maggots and they suck.  Wow.  So that is a horrible thing.  Did that give you bad dreams?  That is fucking horrible.  No, it does not.  No, it does not.  I was just using that as a frame of reference to something that is awful to look at. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, it's frightening.  It really is.  That stuff this morning was fucking chilling.  It really was, right?  That guy was really bad.  I mean, he was really frightening.  Well, I don't say it was scary.  No.  Okay.  Goodbye, guys.  I'm not.  I don't know.  What?  What happened, Dan?  Did he go?  I feel like you guys are being, you're making sport of me.  I'm making sport of you.  I'm a scaredy cat, almost.  You're not a scaredy cat.  I have a terrible lisp, too, honestly. 
[01:51:00]  What?  Awful lisp that you guys are picking up on.  What?  I didn't pick up on a list.  Believe it or not.  Honestly, believe it or not.  Dude, we didn't pick up on the list.  We were just listening to what you're saying, not the way you're saying anything.  Have you said an S word?  I haven't even noticed you saying an S word.  No, Jim, have you heard me say R words, though?  Rally, rabbit, don't kill.  I love this guy.  Could you say I'm really, really tired?  I'm really, really a rabbit who raves in the road and rages and retards. 
[01:51:30]  Rada, rada, rada.  Now can you say, where is everybody going?  I got one.  Where is everybody going?  I'll indulge.  I'll indulge.  Is there an M thing, too?  I don't know.  I don't know if I have an M thing.  I have an M thing.  No, I don't think it does.  Mike, Murray.  Murray.  Say mayor.  The R is what does it.  Hold on.  I got one for you.  Say Mayor Menino murdered Murray.  Okay, this will be good. 
[01:52:00]  Mayor Menino murdered Murray.  Murray.  It's not really an M thing at all.  It's an R thing.  Are you sure?  Is he getting the M out?  I'll give you a little bit of an insight into this.  Yes.  It's a vaulted pallet is what it's called.  You can ask Dr. Steve about it, maybe.  A vaulted pallet?  What's a vaulted pallet?  Like my ceilings.  They vaulted.  How do we avoid getting that, Dr. Steve?  Don't be born with it.  The woof of your mouth, right?  Yep.  The woof of my mouth.  Is too high? 
[01:52:30]  Way too high.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I mean, it's like a dog mouth moving up.  Oh, when you say an R, your tongue does go.  You can't form the sound.  Er, er, er, er.  Yeah, it goes up to the roof of your mouth and leaves a little spot for the R to come out.  So why can't you put some silly putty in there?  Yeah.  Build it up.  Spackle.  I haven't ever tried, honestly.  I do whatever I eat, bologna sandwiches or anything, or ham sandwiches.  Yeah.  With white bread, it'll fucking root to the roof of my mouth. 
[01:53:00]  It's like a suction cup.  So when you say a word, like, if you say, really, your tongue leaves way too much space,  is that what it is?  It'll look like it'd be on my tippy toes.  I have a giant fucking tongue, also.  Er, er.  Ridiculous.  You're dead.  I'm trying to do it, like.  I'm going out of my way for it.  I'm going out of my way for it.  Er, er.  Right.  Really?  Really?  Like, I'm trying to not put my tongue up against the roof of my mouth.  I really don't know.  Do you, R, R?  It honestly, it doesn't work right unless you have a deformed mouth. 
[01:53:30]  Dude, no, no.  But I see what's happening.  Can't you put your tongue against the roof of your mouth?  Can you do that?  Yeah.  No, no.  Not the whole tongue.  I can't get the whole tongue about it against it.  Just the tip.  Yeah, but you said you have a giant tongue, so.  Oh, and it's the sides.  R, R, R, R, R.  R's are the sides of your tongue.  Going by your gum line and the roof of your mouth where it meets.  That's an R.  So you can't do that.  I was fucked up.  I was in speech therapy a lot in school. 
[01:54:00]  She should be fired.  Because, well, no, what happened, I would have an attractive speech therapist, and I was  like a nine-year-old, ten-year-old kid, and I'd just be watching them make obscene gestures  at me with these tongues.  And so I never fucking tried to.  If I was a female speech therapist, I would allow my clients to eat my pussy.  That would really work the tongue properly, don't you think?  Oh, you think?  Tongue exercises?  Yes.  Yeah.  Don't believe me.  I've been making jokes about that.  You would be doing Shakespeare in the Park in no time.  Believe me. 
[01:54:30]  You could be making jokes about anything.  They're not listening to the joke.  Yeah.  That has got to be a bitch.  I'm punching out finally now.  Oh, boy.  Thank you, buddy.  Thanks, Dan.  I want to say to Dan, thanks for being a good sport, brother.  We love you.  That's got to be a bitch.  Yep.  Have a nice one.  All right.  Dan in Cleveland.  Fucking playing along.  How great is that?  The way to fix that, though, is when Dan was saying his arms when he was young, what  you've got to do is you've got to sit there, and you've got to soak your hand in warm  Crisco.  And then whenever he goes, I really...  You go...  Say it right.  Just smack him with a flat hand of warm Crisco. 
[01:55:00]  So it really hurts.  Yeah.  That's the old school way when no one had diseases.  Right?  Where it was just the kid's an asshole or...  Or whatever.  Or he's fucked up or my kid's not going to sound like that.  Now everyone has to be diagnosed with something.  What does that say?  We're looking at these close-ups of these...  That's a dust mite.  This is a dust...  That looks like Cloverfield.  I wonder if Cloverfield, those guys that built that monster, said, let's just do dust  mites.  No, I'm serious.  I know.  The electron microscope of these images of these fucking little bugs and animals are insanely 
[01:55:30]  scary.  And do they use them in Hollywood, Ant?  I would think, like, you would look at that and go, yeah, that'll make a great monster.  We just make it big.  Right.  Yeah.  It's tiny.  It's 10 feet tall, Jim.  If you could do scanning electron microscope maggot, that'll bring up that picture.  Oh, we saw that one with the teeth and the eyes before he, you know, we got rudely interrupted  by Elmer Fudd.  That looks like something from Pixar, doesn't it? 
[01:56:00]  It really does, yeah.  It looks like somebody scared the maggot.  It looks like a little fur jacket on and goofy walrus teeth.  I had no idea.  It kind of looks like a walrus.  It looks like a voss.  Walrus without skin.  That's fucking scary looking.  I don't like looking at that face.  How many...  It's scaring me.  Can you...  Are those the eyes in the front, though?  Yeah.  I don't know that they're actually eyes.  There's some sort of light sensor that are analogous to eyes, but... 
[01:56:30]  Can you put, like, electron microscope?  Why don't they have eyes?  I know.  Everything should have eyes.  Electron microscope images.  Just start there.  How many times has that magnified, Steve?  10 or 12?  Oh, jeez.  That's got to be quite a few.  That's thousands.  Electron?  No, because it's a magnet, eh?  Magnets are...  You can see, so...  Yeah, with a face like that?  Look at the fucking...  A surface...  It's the resolution that you're getting with the electron microscope.  That really...  The thing that's amazing, though, is when I look at electron microscope images, is when  you see a shadow that something that small is casting. 
[01:57:00]  Like, when you see that something like a dust mite blown up, he's actually...  There is, like, a teeny indentation he's putting, or there's a little piece of string  coming off of him.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's, like, how fucking small things get.  Like, just go to anything.  How complex some of these things are.  Yeah, and there's a shadow.  Yeah.  There's shadows, like...  Well, photons are pretty small.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a photon?  No, no.  I mean, if it's casting shadow, light is, you know, it's light. 
[01:57:30]  It's going to cast a shadow, no matter how small something is.  But the really, really tiny ones are almost black and white in...  Now, what if that's for clarity, or is that just because...  No, any electron microscope picture that you see that has color in it, it's false color.  It's colorized.  ...in post.  Oh, really?  Look at that ant.  Yeah.  Because electrons don't have color, so when they bounce off these things, you're just  getting a black and white image.  And how does an electron microscope work compared to a regular camera? 
[01:58:00]  Well, here's the thing.  Electrons have more mass than photons, so their wavelength is actually smaller than a photon.  So you can get higher resolution and see much smaller things using electrons than you can.  And you can focus...  Since electrons have an electric charge, you can focus them using magnets rather than a lens.  So instead of visible light reflecting off of the surface of something, it's electrons. 
[01:58:30]  You're using electrons.  Yeah.  We're looking at this ant, you know, magnified.  I know that's a picture of me.  Hey, why do all ants look like they have muscles and they don't have to work out?  They really do.  I don't get that shit.  Look at his fucking biceps.  Yeah, why as humans we're all fucking flabby messes, but in the animal kingdom, everyone  has muscles.  It looks like muscles.  That's his exoskeleton.  Yeah, it's an exoskeleton, so they're just built that way. 
[01:59:00]  It's just like they're wearing the...  Wait, wait, wait.  Dr. Steve, I got one.  Oh, exoskeleton marks the spot.  Thanks for calling in, Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, always an informative treat when you're calling.  Dr. Steve is really smart.  He is a smart motherfucker.  He's a good Googler.  A real...  John in Memphis has one more question for Dr. Steve before we let him go.  Yeah, Dr. Steve, good morning. 
[01:59:30]  Head next girlfriend, when you played with her nipples and sucked them, she'd actually  express milk out of them.  She was never pregnant, never had any kids, but you could milk her.  Yeah, you were stimulating her a lot, I'm guessing, because you can get just about anyone  to express milk if you stimulate the nipple.  Oh, God damn it.  And there are people who do this.  They're called adult nursing relationships where they'll get together and a guy will 
[02:00:00]  nurse.  Is it a friend of yours, Steve?  Is it a friend of yours that's into this, maybe?  But it's out there, and what people will do is they'll go over, and it could be male,  male, male, female, and sometimes they'll even try it with guys being the person who's  being nursed on.  But if you actually nurse on a schedule, like every four hours with somebody who's never  been pregnant, they will eventually begin to lactate. 
[02:00:30]  How long does it take?  That's great.  Oh, it can take weeks, weeks a month sometimes.  But it's not a lot, and although everybody's different, there may be a few women out there  that can, you know, could actually nurse somebody with enough milk, but they will start to produce  some milk.  This is great.  I've got to say hi to Creepy Craig who says, Dr. Steve can even ruin tits. 
[02:01:00]  That's great.  Holy shit.  You want to hear one of my favorite jokes when I was younger?  Bug line.  Here's a joke I used to love when I was growing up, and I really did enjoy this joke.  It's a little weird, but there's this guy, and it's what we're talking about, who is  out at a bar, and there's no one available for him, so he sees this older woman.  You know, the guy's like 20, she's like 50, and he's just not into it, but he picks her  up.  And they're fooling around, and he's sucking her breasts, and he gets a mouthful of fluid, 
[02:01:30]  and he goes, you know, that's kind of weird, but he tastes okay, so he swallows it.  And then he's sucking her breast, and he gets a mouthful of fluid, and he's like, oh, that's  kind of kinky, that's not my thing.  So after they're done having sex, he goes, wow, that was kind of weird, I sucked on your  breasts, and I got, you know, I got milk.  I thought you were too old to give milk.  And she sighed and went, I am, but unfortunately, I'm not too old to have cancer.  That was one of my favorite jokes when I was a teenager.  And I'm sure most of this audience saw that coming, but no one did when I was 14. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, God.  Isn't that terrible?  Horrible.  That's a terrible joke.  That is a horrible joke.  Steve?  I told that for years when I was a kid.  Wow.  We lost Steve on that one?  No, I'm just speechless.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The best part is the old man sighing, I think.  Where are you getting your cholesterol this morning, Steve?  Oh, I'm having skim milk and kashi this morning. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, all right.  Man!  Dr. Steve.  Thanks, boy.  Always a pleasure.  Always, always.  Give the plug.  What's that?  Oh, shit.  No, no, I mean it.  Weird Medicine, 10 p.m. Saturday.  Very cool.  Very informative show.  Talk to you soon, Steve.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Thank you.  Well, the electrons. 
[02:03:00]  I know.  Yeah.  Well, he was a chemist.  He was a physics major.  Focus with magnets.  Yeah, the wavelength is less.  I bet he could make, like, crystal meth.  Like, in Breaking Bad.  I bet he could, like, make some crystal meth and sell it.  That's what he does.  A crystal meth salesman.  Yeah, the flesh will rot.  He just knows everything and puts it in that terminology of his...  What was that word?  Mucicity or...  Mucicity.  No. 
[02:03:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, mucicity.  It's...  He's probably laughing at that right now.  Yeah, mucicity and the sunshine band.  Mucicity.  Oh.  When we get back, the second half of the audio from Comic-Con.  Yes.  From Jim and Sam.  And, well, we've found somebody else to do interviews.  Yeah, I see that.  Oh, yeah.  I don't acknowledge that.  You're not happy.  Hold on.  I'm not saying I'm not happy.  I just don't acknowledge that person.  That's good.  I would love to. 
[02:04:00]  I would love to hear people's reactions to it.  Oh, we're going to play it next.  That's for sure.  But first, it's time for today in O&A history.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents...  Presents...  This Day in O&A.  In O&A.  Our favorite moments from this very day in Opie and Anthony history.  On This Day in O&A, back in 2010,  we discovered Basil Marceau,  an actual gubernatorial candidate for the state of Tennessee.  Here's Basil Marceau. 
[02:04:30]  I'm basilmarceau.com,  the Republican candidate for governor.  That's fucking Mayor Menino.  I'm basilmarceau.com,  the Republican candidate for governor.  I'd like to recall all permits and registration for guns.  Everyone can carry guns.  If you kill someone, no, you get murdered.  You go to jail.  And I'd like to put...  Basil Marceau is an ass.  Look at this guy.  Holy shit.  He's like an SNL fucking character.  He's a fucking rules. 
[02:05:00]  To lose to this guy, you'd have to just go,  cunt, fuck, cunt.  This Day in O&A, in O&A, O&A.  The Virus Sirius XM.  Coming up on the next Jimsy M.E.  Jimsy investigates the death of an all-star athlete.  That girl went out and bought a gun, Sam.  We knew she had ill intentions.  What could drive a young mistress to murder? 
[02:05:30]  She got a hold of that big black dick and she went crazy, Sam.  She'd only had white and Iranian ones.  They never hit bottom, Sam.  Steve McNair hit bottom.  But first, an old case resurfaces and Jimsy must tie up some loose ends.  Give me my members only jacket.  I gotta find Abigail.  She's a very troubled girl.  The clock is ticking.  Can Jimsy get there in time?  He was gonna marry her.  And then her flat-ass friend came over to my boat. 
[02:06:00]  And I didn't see her from the side.  I just saw two breaths materialize in thin air.  Finally, Jimsy must choose between the path of his career and the road to his heart.  Detective Monaghan has the paperwork.  And so is my homoerotic boss.  Quick, tickle my balls with your mustache.  It feels good.  All in the next Jimsy Emmy.  You mother in you.  It was premeditated.  You mother in you.  It's not the same like it was. 
[02:06:30]  Erectile dysfunction has become a serious epidemic.  Pussy is over.  Don't mean nothing no more.  I can't get a hard on.  Take it from legendary comedian and ED sufferer Pat Cooper.  It's no joke.  I'm not making this shit up.  You're with that gorgeous muffa.  And you're in bed and it don't happen.  Happened to me.  And she goes, what's the matter?  I said, I think it's erectile dysfunction.  She goes, what's that?  I'm fucking dead.  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option.  I tried Cialis. 
[02:07:00]  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction, contact your physician to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist.  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big fill is peeing.  I said, when I was getting laid, I said, go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah.  It's the same fucking thing.  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper.  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction hype.  Fuck all the bullshit. 
[02:07:30]  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  Sirius XM, the virus, the Opie and Anthony show.  So Jimmy and Sambo were in San Diego for the Comic Con, also known as Comic Con. 
[02:08:00]  Yes.  Comic Con.  It was fun too, man.  Comic Con.  Like the people there.  Comic Con.  Comic Con.  Comic Con.  What started in 1970 as a small collection of nerds has exploded into one of the entertainment  industry's largest live promotional events.  Over a hundred TV shows and movies are there to create a buzz about themselves.  Now, being no stranger to the buzz a major motion picture can give you because I had a 
[02:08:30]  pivotal role in Spider-Man.  Yes, you did.  That's why I'm here, to create a buzz.  About me.  Are you known in the geek world for being in Spider-Man?  No.  I think I've been recognized twice.  Why not, though?  Because some of these guys are known for just having a line in a big movie.  Sure.  I'm surprised that that hasn't hit you yet.  I don't know.  I don't think anybody really cares.  Well, you know what?  I think at a Comic Con thing, that would be pretty huge.  When you're doing these pieces, a lot of times there's a couple of possible angles you're 
[02:09:00]  going to go with.  Right.  And one of the angles was we were concentrating on the fact that I was in Spider-Man.  Yeah.  So we showed Stan Lee my line.  I interviewed Stan Lee.  It didn't make the final cut of the piece because it was in a weird location.  And we were showing all these people my line and we were actually making a big deal about  it, but it just didn't go anywhere.  I was handing out Jim Norton shirts.  So much stuff doesn't make the piece because they shot two hours of stuff for a five and  a half minute piece.  Yeah.  And I had, he stinks and I don't like him shirts and I was handing them out with my 
[02:09:30]  picture on them.  I DVR'd it.  I still haven't seen it, man.  It's not a bad bitch.  Usually I check out all your Leno appearances.  This one I haven't seen yet.  That's okay.  I mean, it went pretty well.  I was happy with how it went over.  I'll check it out today.  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to it.  These are good interviews.  Well, the big interview show's tomorrow at 10 o'clock?  Yes.  And we're just giving you a little taste here and there, right?  Yeah.  On the 10 o'clock show tomorrow, we'll have the Joel McHale interview, Bruce Campbell,  Elijah Wood, the Mythbusters. 
[02:10:00]  And some of these clips are from a larger piece that will be featured.  And I understand there's also going to be video put up, which we're working on.  Am I correct?  Oh, yeah.  Somebody's got an internet TV show he's working on.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's true.  Perhaps.  Oh, no.  No.  I just figured out.  No.  Well, we met somebody who really thinks themselves a good interviewer and feels that he could 
[02:10:30]  do an interview show online.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Apparently so.  Do you know this person, Jimmy?  I'm not sure.  I haven't listened to the clips.  I'm not sure.  Okay.  I've actually heard none of these, for real.  Well, right.  Let's get back into the clips from Comic-Con.  Please.  Oh.  Who's Cass?  I don't remember.  Oh, no. 
[02:11:00]  What?  Cass.  Who's Cass?  I don't remember.  I don't know.  We meet a psycho named Cass.  I wish I could remember.  I don't remember her.  Did we play it?  I don't think we played it.  No.  Eric, do you have any idea?  Really?  Again?  What are you talking about?  This is where we left off.  I don't remember Cass.  I don't think we played this one.  We didn't play this?  This is where we, uh...  I don't remember Cass, so...  We meet a psycho named Cass who starts yelling in the convention hall about how much he likes  Demetri Martin.  Oh, we didn't play this.  I remember the Demetri Martin, but...  We didn't play this, though.  Until security stops her? 
[02:11:30]  What's this one about, Jimmy?  I don't know.  She wanted money or something.  We should probably hear this again.  My memory is...  I was looking at the TV.  Foggy.  Yeah, I'm a little foggy is a good word for it.  Hear it again.  I don't remember hearing it at all.  Yeah, I thought we didn't.  Jim might have heard it when it actually happened.  Right.  It's at Comic Con.  I don't remember hearing the clip.  The clip, no.  Why are we having a tough time being on the same page with this?  I don't know.  Because you're a bad liar.  Hi! 
[02:12:00]  Where are you from?  I'm from San Diego.  Oh, you are?  I think I didn't see that before.  Maybe.  I don't remember.  Yeah, you look different now.  What are you holding?  Oh, I put it on a lanyard.  I got a little fancy with it.  I was like, hey, yo.  I need my hands free.  For what?  So that people can, you know, they'll be like, hey, what's up?  You want a high five?  Or, you know, check the sign out.  Check the front, right?  And then they're like, and then I'm like, yo, you know Dimitri?  Like, Tom, I'm looking for him. 
[02:12:30]  Geek for Dimitri.  Anybody can email me, though.  Like, it's not a big deal.  We got to cross our fingers.  I want to make some money to see Dimitri Martin.  Dimitri Martin, does anyone know who Dimitri Martin is?  It's really funny.  Do you want to help me get there?  Do you have like 25 cents a penny?  A penny goes a long way.  I can't ask for money.  Oh, how can I?  I'm okay.  I didn't ask for anything.  You were asking for a quarter of a dollar?  Oh, fucking security.  You're asking for money. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, like she was going to make a few thousand dollars.  Maybe she'd make a little pocket money.  That's Cass.  And she was, what, yelling to everybody?  Yeah, just screaming in the middle of the floor.  Yeah, I mean.  Screaming.  Really making a scene.  Were people turning around?  Oh, God, yeah.  They were gathering.  They were gathering.  They were gathering.  Fucking security, though.  It's like, oh, now you're asking for money.  For, for, for, for, for, for.  Watch this old crazy girl at a fucking convention.  She, she knew the show, though.  Did she?  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  What do you mean by that?  I don't understand.  Well, she knew you guys.  She knew the show.  She did?  Yeah.  She was familiar with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I believe she was.  I didn't know that.  Well, she started.  I just wanted to get in on the lying.  Has Iroch so eloquently put it?  That way we can't get our stories straight.  So eloquently put it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Iroch, we're not good at lying?  I think the feed's repeating yesterday's show here.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  That's going to leave a mark. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah.  You, Opie and Anthony, you know Demetri, so I want to talk to you, so I can't get to  him.  And you know what really sucks?  Who?  Iroch.  That big, fat pig.  He's like, what?  He's eating donuts all the time.  God.  Ladies and gentlemen, Iroch sucks.  He's a big, fat pig.  But if you got donuts, if you got donuts, he's your best friend. 
[02:14:30]  The best part, I can visualize it, because you hear it a little bit in the background.  Jimmy is losing his fucking ass.  I'm howling.  You're doubled over.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Dude, I was howling, because she's screaming this in front of strangers.  She's just yelling it on the floor.  Do you know if this is Saturday afternoon?  Yeah.  It was fucking mobbed.  It was mobbed.  There were tens of thousands of people.  I have video of it, and it's fucking a madhouse. 
[02:15:00]  Looks like someone took a CD away from me today.  Where's the bonus track?  I don't know.  That we played yesterday.  Oh, well, I guess somebody didn't want that submitted.  Iroch, what happened to the bonus track?  If you turned it over, it's on the glass table there in the studio.  Glass table?  Why haven't we been shitting on it?  We're doing that into the mics.  Denise Richards is coming by today, huh?  I think she's on Fox News. 
[02:15:30]  Is that pre-taped?  She's going to be at SiriusXM.  I think she was already.  When?  Earlier?  I was looking at the tweet.  There's a picture of her and Fla-Fla-Flooly.  Oh.  Like 40, about 50 minutes ago.  Oh, she's out of here.  It's about an hour ago.  And I see her there at Fox News.  Yeah.  She probably ran over there.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't see her.  Does she still look good?  Or was it?  Yeah, she looks all right, man. 
[02:16:00]  Longo in El Tootho.  You saw her wrong?  I went down to the elevator with her, yeah.  Oh, you went down to the elevator with her?  She smelled good.  How did that?  She smelled good?  Yeah.  She's coming back at 11.  A tub in an elevator.  I'm kidding.  You're going to go something right here.  But maybe that one wasn't for you.  It wasn't even directed.  I was just being fun.  I know, it's fun. 
[02:16:30]  I had a bad muffin.  Did you?  Yeah.  Was it good?  Nah.  I used to fix it.  What?  What?  What happened?  All right.  I guess we don't have the bonus track.  That's too bad.  Maybe we'll go back to Cass yelling and screaming at everyone at Comic-Con.  We move on with Jimmy and Sam's interviews, and it looks like someone was helping out down  there in San Diego.  Yeah, I think he came on his own dime, or maybe he had his TV show foot the bill.  I don't know.  Well, this person got to talk to Princess Leia. 
[02:17:00]  That's right.  We had Princess Leia on, right?  Yes.  No, no, no.  Oh, it's not really Princess Leia.  Right.  It's some chick dressed as Princess Leia.  Fucking conventions.  Yuck.  Yeah, that's a lot.  Oh, no.  Oh, I got to strive in for this one.  Oh, no.  Well, I met up with this guy, and he said he wanted to just kind of wing it, improv,  hit the floor.  That's great, man.  And kind of try some shit out on some people.  You know what?  Some people have that talent, Sam. 
[02:17:30]  He told me he did.  Yeah.  Was he a good improver?  I mean, I didn't think improv was his strong suit, necessarily.  Did he try to be funny?  He did, and then he just got cruel.  Ooh.  Before we get into that.  Sure.  Sam, you are fucking caught red-handed.  With what?  Craig in Maine.  Craig.  Hey, what's going on?  It's a guy named Luther claiming to be your father.  What do you got, sir?  Hey, Sam's a little instigating shit. 
[02:18:00]  Language.  Oh.  Is this the same caller every time?  No, no, no.  This is the first time I've ever called.  You've got to listen to him, though.  When she yells out, do you know what really sucks?  Sam yells back, who?  Oh, because she blew the line you wrote for her.  Sam.  I didn't write her any lines.  E-Rock, you should be really mad at Sam.  He is.  I don't know why you're mad at us all the time when Sam is the one.  Well, because...  Wait, let me hear that really fast, and then we'll get to you and E-Rock. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, P and Anthony, you know Demetri, so I want to talk to you, so I can't get to him.  And you know what really sucks?  Who?  E-Rock.  She said who?  She didn't say what?  No, no, no, no.  She says, you know what really sucks.  You talked over it, Sam, so I don't even know what's right.  Do you know what really sucks?  Hold on a second.  I want to talk to you, so I can't get to him.  And you know what really sucks?  Who?  E-Rock.  Ah, you fucking suck.  Do you know what really sucks? 
[02:19:00]  Who?  You would have said what?  You said who?  No.  She said what?  She said it quick.  She said what?  She said who?  And you said who as in no, who?  No, she said who.  What now?  What?  Who?  When?  Jesus Christ.  E-Rock.  That's a kid in the...  Jim Brewer doing the racist. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  One of the best bits ever.  I'm bad.  I'm having a Costello.  That's a...  A...  A...  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  All right.  So, anyway, let's get into this.  Princess Leia was interviewed by one of the guys.  Yeah, one of the...  He's trying on his new TV show, so I figured I'd bring the audio.  That's good.  That sounds like a 12-year-old when I'm on camera.  Oh, that's okay.  We're just interviewing people for Comic-Con.  Are you having a good time or something? 
[02:20:00]  I am.  It's been great.  What's your name?  My name is Summer.  Summer?  Oh, it's a good time of year.  It is.  Are you supposed to see Princess Leia?  Yes.  What's with the chain or something?  Looks like you got all chained up in there.  She's actually hooked to Jabba at one point during the movie, and she escapes by breaking  the chain.  Is that like a real chain?  It's not real.  How heavy is that?  It's really light.  So you probably couldn't use that to chain a bicycle or nothing like that? 
[02:20:30]  No.  You couldn't.  Is she your favorite Star Trek character?  Star Wars?  Yeah.  Yes, she is.  I like her a lot.  I like...  That's a very cool front thing, too, with the boots.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  It looks like you're ready to go out in space or something.  That's right.  You got a boyfriend?  I get 5'15".  Is he...  Like, who is he?  He plays...  He dresses up as Boba Fett.  Who?  Also from Star Wars.  He dresses up as Boba Fett.  Boba Fett?  Boba.  Oh, he was like the bounty hunter or something, right? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, is he...  Where's Boba Fett?  I like him.  He's not here today.  How come?  You had to work.  I had a chain like that one time.  I was chaining my bike up with it.  No, it's too loose.  I don't know what to ask.  Oh, God!  Oh!  Oh!  I was really getting, like, goosebumps.  Like, it was so uncomfortable. 
[02:21:30]  That is really uncomfortable.  Chip would stop talking sometimes and just zone out and they would walk away.  I think Chip would just...  When he was done, he was done.  The strategy...  And then the strategy for getting interviews for Chip was also just...  As soon as one interview ended, I was holding the camera and just said,  Hey, whoever was in a costume, come here.  You want to get interviewed?  And there was no...  And they're like, okay, what's this for?  And then immediately Chip starts talking to him.  Oh, okay.  That's a great plan. 
[02:22:00]  Chip petered out a little bit on, like, some of them.  He would just stop talking.  Oh!  I don't know what to ask.  I mean...  Oh, it's so uncomfortable.  Well, Chip continues.  Oh!  You got to talk to some anime guy.  Yeah.  Some anime.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember.  Hi, that's pretty...  What's the outfit, sir?  Federation Lieutenant.  Oh, wow.  What's that?  Sorry.  Where are you from?  Scythe 7.  Where's that?  It's one of the Lagrange points around the Earth. 
[02:22:30]  What's the movie from with the...  Original Gundam.  Universal Century 0079.  That's pretty cool.  Are you here doing, like, signings and stuff?  I don't think so.  No one's asking for an autograph.  I don't have a pen or nothing.  I'll probably ask you.  Are you having fun?  I'm having a great time.  I was at the other Comic-Con one time in Jersey.  Really?  Cool.  There's a lot of ugly girls here.  Really? 
[02:23:00]  Your tastes are too high.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And this video of this?  All of it.  Oh, great.  Fuck.  Oh, my God.  So uncomfortable.  Chip is lousy.  Oh, Chip's stinky.  There's an interviewer.  He's putting together a pilot to pitch Chip a TV.  Chip a TV.  A Chip a TV?  Yeah.  It's so bad. 
[02:23:30]  What's going on with these people, though?  Oh, Chip is so bad at interviewing.  He's terrible.  You wouldn't watch Chip a TV?  I'd watch every second of it.  Of course you would.  You would have to watch Chip a TV.  Oh, my God.  Does Chip want, like, an intro for the intro song?  Would it be more, like, heavy metal or, like?  Probably, because Burn and Embus did, like, a lot of heavy metal covers.  Right, Burn and Embus, his rock band.  Do you have any Burning Embers tracks that we could put on for this?  Nah, it was a fire. 
[02:24:00]  What?  It was burning.  We didn't tape, though.  We just, boom, put it out there.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how you do it.  That's how you roll.  Do you ever get to hear Chip's voice?  It's fucking awful.  It really is bad.  Yeah.  And he's got no ad-libbing skills.  No fucking...  Horrible.  Nothing of interest to ask these people.  Do you think he's insightful?  He knows nothing about them.  Long pauses.  Long, uncomfortable pauses.  Comfortable pauses, yes.  He ends the interview way before anything interesting has happened. 
[02:24:30]  It's perfect.  I have to hear more.  Princess Leia, he just kept going back to the chain and referencing it as a bike chain.  Yeah, yeah, what was the chain?  Like a bike chain or something?  He called it a machine.  He said, so you couldn't use it as a bike chain.  And she said, no.  And then he asked two more questions.  Then he went back to it and called it a bike chain again.  Back to it, I'm calling it a bike chain.  Why do people walk around like that?  I don't get it.  They're celebrating.  What character was he?  I don't even know what he was.  I don't remember.  Someone from Gundam.  It's some fucking anime thing, though.  Yeah.  It's one of those fucking Japanese-y things. 
[02:25:00]  It's like Halloween.  It's fun.  No, it's not.  I don't understand that.  No, it's not.  What?  Everyone wants to be cool, too.  You always dress as the cool fucking guy.  But it must be great to go through life like it's Halloween every day, though.  Yeah.  That can't be the worst thing.  How many Boba Fetts were there?  There weren't as many Boba Fetts as I thought there would be.  There were still a lot of Jokers.  People can't let that go.  Oh, my God, really?  They can't let it go.  The Heath Ledger version?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That seems kind of old now.  Jeez, come on.  It does, right? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Chip talks to some bad girls from Hogwarts.  Oh, my God.  Some Harry Potter.  Harry Potter bad girls.  They had little schoolgirl skirts on, and their shirts were unbuttoned and tied, and had  the Hogwarts thing.  Oh, fucking hot.  You know how Chip likes the ladies, too?  Oh, Chip loves the ladies.  He loves to impress, because he knows that the key to a lady's heart is just to talk, you  know?  And so Chip just goes in there with his game.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Just talking to the ladies. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, hi.  What's your name?  I'm Chip.  Hi, Chip.  Oh, look at you.  You got your tie.  It looks like you're going back to school or something.  No, I was just expelled from school.  I did, too.  We're Hogwarts harlots, and we've been expelled.  Me and my friend Teddy got caught in the closet when I was a kid.  How'd that work out for you?  We got yelled at.  Where are you from or something?  We're from here, San Diego.  Oh, you're from San Diego?  Is this your first time at Comical Con? 
[02:26:30]  Yes, it is.  What are you?  Are you supposed to be the ladies from Hogwarts?  Yeah, we're Hogwarts bad girls.  What's bad?  Uh-oh.  We're too cool for school.  We're too hot for school.  Yeah, I was too hot for school, too.  I would put on the air conditioning.  They could use them for that in here.  Yeah.  There's a lot of ugly people here.  Look at that guy's hat.  I hope he gets shot.  I hope he gets shot. 
[02:27:00]  I was just kidding.  He likes when I say mean stuff about people.  Are you having a good time?  Yes.  Oh, look at this.  The person's all yellow.  Looks like they fell into some lemonade or something.  He looks like a power ranger.  Oh, wow.  A lot of camel toe.  I think that's definitely a girl, yeah.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I hope so.  Otherwise, he's got a little one.  All right.  We'll see you guys later.  Oh, no.  They were done with you. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, was that fucking great?  That was my face.  You just start losing it.  Chip would just say mean things.  He said, I hope he gets shot.  He just wanted to pick off him.  I hope he gets shot.  I hope he gets shot.  What the hat was it?  I don't remember.  It was just...  Wasn't it raging?  There was also...  There's this...  I guess one of the boots were giving out this paper hat that had yellow spiky hair coming  out of it, and Chip, the whole time I was making the video, literally, every three minutes, 
[02:28:00]  would grab me and go, hey, look at that guy's hat.  It looks like he's got bananas on his head or something.  He did it every time somebody passed it, then he did it again.  Holy shit.  It's so annoying.  Sam, did you have to hang out with Chip?  I hung out with him before...  Yeah.  No, no.  You know what I'm saying.  Yeah, Chip dominated the weekend.  I once rode home with, not Jimmy and his girlfriend, I rode home with Uncle Paul and  his girlfriend.  Oh.  No.  Uncle Paul... 
[02:28:30]  Last year, Uncle Paul...  No, he becomes the person.  I know.  Did you hang out with the person?  Uncle Paul showed up a bunch last year, every time we passed kids, but Uncle Paul didn't  show up much this year.  Yeah.  Chip has really dominated the scene when it comes to the people.  Uncle Paul probably wasn't allowed in.  No, but Chip was...  I mean, Chip was there for a lot of the weekend.  Yeah.  Okay.  Chip just hangs out.  He hangs out a lot.  He does say some mean stuff about other people, too.  Yeah.  He loves being social, is the thing about Chip.  Yeah.  He gets to know people.  But he's got no couth.  Like, he says horrible things that make everybody uncomfortable without realizing, thinking that 
[02:29:00]  he's just one of the guys.  I think that was the first time Chip broke character, too.  I love that.  Yeah, yeah.  It just really made me laugh to want to say that guy has an awful hat.  I hope he gets shot.  Fucking two girls.  I hope he gets...  And he couldn't even say, I hope he gets...  Shh.  I hope he gets...  These two girls showed up in outfits.  Everybody's just trying to have a good time.  Yeah.  And you want somebody to get shot.  Shot.  Because you don't like his hat.  Classic. 
[02:29:30]  Chip talks to another Princess Leia.  Of course.  Oh.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  I'm okay.  I'm Chip.  What's the kind of gun is that?  It's a blaster.  And a blaster?  And what do you use that for?  To kill people.  Where are you from?  Star Wars.  You're from Star Wars?  Is that like a place or something?  I was...  I'm from a park of...  So I was...  I don't hear the movies.  What?  How old are you?  21. 
[02:30:00]  21?  Oh, so you just started drinking?  Yeah.  Wink, wink.  What's your name?  Mariah.  Hi, I'm Chipper.  Um, I like your chain or something.  Is that like a real bike chain?  I had one like that and my friends used to whip me with it.  What's my back?  It's plastic.  Oh.  I had a bike chain one time and my friend Bruce took it off and he was whipping my back and  told the police to stop.  That sounds like it would hurt.  Yeah.  Do you come with a bunch... 
[02:30:30]  Is there a bunch of guys that you like here?  Because they're all dressed up as different people.  Um, I came with a group of people.  Oh, did you guys drive or take a bus?  We drove.  Oh, we took a plane.  Yeah.  Um, I think my group's leaving though, so...  I'm sorry.  Have a fun time at Comical Con.  Bye-bye.  It was nice talking to you.  That chick wanted to fuck me so bad.  She was getting all wet and sloppy.  The best part, these people want attention so bad. 
[02:31:00]  And they're running away.  And they're running away stopping the interview.  They fucking was so annoyed with Chip.  They just wanted to get away from him.  As soon as they realized that this is not legitimate, this guy's an idiot.  Yeah, he's just a fucking tard.  Oh my God.  That is so bad.  And I mean, we...  Chip was there for like 35 minutes.  Yeah.  So, I mean, I just brought a sampling of it.  We can do a whole Chip Comic Con special, really.  Well, we should get more Chip clips, I'm thinking.  You want some? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  I know it pains me to say that, Sam, but yes.  All right.  There was a couple times he commented on people in wheelchairs.  Yeah.  Really?  Not to them, but to other people.  Just how he didn't like people in wheelchairs.  It was bothering him.  He had his own ideas of what should be done with them.  That's all he did, did he?  Well, one more for today.  Chip talks to Mystique.  What's Mystique?  She's the blue woman from X-Men.  Okay.  Yeah.  Hi, can we interview you? 
[02:32:00]  Wow, that's really cool.  What's your name?  My name's Savannah.  It looks like you ate a bunch of blueberries or something.  Yeah, pretty much.  What's that supposed to be?  I'm Mystique from X-Men.  Mystique?  Mystique.  Oh, it looks like...  Wow, that's really cool.  Is that pain?  Yes, it's body paint, yeah.  How do you get that off?  Um, a really, really hot shower.  Oh, yeah, I take a lot of cold showers, though, because you know what I'm saying.  What's your name? 
[02:32:30]  I'm Leah.  Hi, are you having fun?  Yeah, I am.  It's really fun here.  There's a lot of big, fat people here.  I hate them.  You said it, not me.  I know, but it bugs me, though, when they're all fat and stuff.  Don't you hate that?  No, not really, no.  That's why you should say that you're blue, because they stepped on your feet or something.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, exactly.  How long did it take you to do that?  Probably like two hours, right?  Yeah, like two hours.  And you just put it, you didn't put it all over yourself, right? 
[02:33:00]  Not, not everywhere, no.  Yeah, not, you know.  How come you didn't dress up?  You just got your shirt on.  She has squawk ears.  Yeah.  I didn't even, let me see that.  Oh, could you get that with the camera?  It looks like you're trying to listen to something in Timbuktu or something.  That's real pointy and stuffy ears.  Yeah.  You should probably jab somebody right in the eye like that.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, just take their fucking eyes out.  All these fat people. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, it's nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  Have a good comical, kind.  Take their fucking eyes out.  Ah, shit.  He started laughing at that one, too.  Take his fucking eyes out.  Jesus.  Chip is just mean-spirited.  Do you think Timbuktu was a good improv?  No, it was horrible.  Chip just gets belligerent when he can't improv.  It gets frustrated. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Also left a little in because the special will have a full eight or nine minutes straight  of Chip doing his interviews.  So I left in because he left the mic on.  He just was riffing between interviews.  I bet.  It's like when he was walking, he'd have little comments about what was going on.  He interviewed one of the security guards after they told him to keep moving.  It's a bunch of comedy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  At one point, he even said, hey, this is easy.  We need more of those. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  You want some more today?  Yeah, if you want.  If it's easy.  I would love to hear at least one more.  Those are not good.  They're so completely bad and so hard to listen to.  I mean, if you guys want to take a ride, I'll give you some longer form stuff with Chip.  If you guys want to take a ride.  I think the smartest is better.  Whatever you think works.  All right.  And like I said, this is all sort of pilot stuff for Chip-a TV. 
[02:35:00]  Chip-a TV.  Yeah.  What about Bill Tetley?  Is he getting pushed over?  No, he's doing TV already.  He's got a big Christmas special.  Oh, you know about Bill Tetley?  Yeah.  He asked me to be on it, but I was busy.  Oh, really?  That's a lie.  That's a lie.  You're busy with your own stuff.  Yeah.  That is a lie because there's no more room for any more guests because what's the Bill Tetley  special again?  It's a 40-minute stand-up interview with Cheap Trick.  Cheap Trick.  And then two minutes with the band-mitten champion. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  And I forgot the other thing.  I thought there was...  That might be it because with commercials, that's 42.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  I think that was the entire special.  Great.  It's that.  Please film that.  Oh, God.  It just sounds like the worst show.  Yeah, it's probably not going to be ahead.  All right.  More chip after the break?  Yeah, I'll grab some more stuff.  And like I said, we'll take a ride.  We'll go a little long form.  Ah, a little long form.  If you think it'll work, yeah, fine.  And then let's not forget tomorrow at 10 o'clock is the big Comic-Con special from these 
[02:36:00]  guys.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's really long form.  I'm not going to go eight or nine minutes, but yeah, it'll be...  That's about right.  Do you mean just squeeze the good one out?  That was long, man.  I got a pretty funny...  It just reminds me.  This is a text I got, and I copied and saved it from my ex-girlfriend yesterday. 
[02:36:30]  It's the last thing on the thing.  I did it so I could read it on the air here.  Just read this last one.  The last little...  Yeah, it's a text I got from you.  A text.  Ugh.  Ugh.  My shit smells like vomit.  I kind of wish Bobby could smell it.  He'd puke instantly.  Oh, my God.  That's the greatest girl ever.  Why are you letting her go?  My shit smells like vomit.  Why are you letting that one go? 
[02:37:00]  You have a lot of fighting.  It's a good age.  That is a good one.  Wow.  I'd rather have bedbugs than black neighbors.  She sent me that text.  Did she use black?  Yes, she did.  Oh, okay.  I quote her directly.  Directly.  Verbatim.  Verbottom.  Verbottom.  More Chip after the break.  The Virus Sirius XM. 
[02:37:30]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Here's.  Fuck you.  I'd like to send a big F.U. out to the fucking yoga instructor that called my boss to complain  about how I was trying to sell her some fucking equipment.  I hope you're fucking cunt-rocked out doing downward-facing dogs.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I just want to say, fuck you, Roland, and your fucking beach impediment.  I don't know what it is, but I can't understand a single goddamn word you say on the radio. 
[02:38:00]  What is your problem?  Fuck you.  I'll give a big fuck you to my fiancee.  We're getting married in four months.  All of a sudden, she decides...  I don't want to have sex, you know.  He's married.  Let me be more special.  Fuck that.  I'm trying to get laid.  Five nights a week.  She's fucking cock-locking me.  Goddamn it.  Now I'm going to have to go on my back and take a shit and whack off.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to give a fuck you to my ex-wife.  I go away to Iraq and defend our country and make all these fucking sacrifices. 
[02:38:30]  And I come home and you're fucking divorcing me?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to send a big fuck you rap to my best friend for beating the shit out of  his wife after he said I'd have been fucking up for the past two years.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to Sandy Kane.  Sandy Kane, drop dead and fucking die.  Boy, you're just a worthless piece of shit.  Fuck you, Sandy Kane.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[02:39:00]  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Are ya?  You know what?  Thanks for checking us out today.  We appreciate it.  Oh, we sure do, people.  I hate to give these guys attention, but 10-year anniversary of 9-11 is coming up.  They got the World Trade Center Memorial.  I saw a piece on that on New York One here in New York. 
[02:39:30]  Yes.  Yesterday.  They got some really cool things going on down there.  Yeah.  They got the tree that survived the whole damn thing.  Oh, right.  You've heard about the tree, right?  Yeah.  So the tree is one of the only things that survived down there.  So they nurtured this tree, and then they made the mistake of putting it in the Bronx,  I think.  Like, why would you do that, first of all?  And then it's up there in the Bronx, and then it's knocked over in a horrible storm.  So then they brought it back to Ground Zero, and now it's planted as part of this memorial. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  But it has all the chains and stuff on it, because they really don't want this thing dying anytime soon.  But they also have the cross.  Yeah, the big metal cross.  It's made out of a...  It was actually part of the wreckage.  Right.  Part of the debris, the beams that made a cross.  And it was a very, you know, kind of a spiritual thing for a lot of the rescue workers that were down there.  Big time symbolic for a lot of people, right?  Yeah.  I'm not a massively religious person, but I thought it was kind of cool.  Like, hey, this is kind of a cool thing, you know? 
[02:40:30]  We should kind of put that somewhere.  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't think it's like...  Because you look at it, and you don't go like, oh, why don't you bolt a Jesus to it or something?  You know?  You just look at it as kind of like, wow, that's, you know, kind of lifting people's spirits as they're working through this.  And it goes to your point.  Enough time goes by, and we all go back to being fucking assholes to each other, you know?  And we're up to today.  Atheists are suing to block the cross from the World Trade Center Memorial. 
[02:41:00]  They have to get involved.  Can't you just...  Just leave it alone.  Leave it alone.  If you don't agree with it or something, that's fine, but, I mean...  Just fucking let it be.  Yeah.  Just leave it the fuck alone.  Yeah.  They didn't have the balls to sue, what, September 12th.  But, you know, you bring up this point a lot.  Enough time goes by, and we're not being nice to each other anymore. 
[02:41:30]  All our flags ended up on the side of the highways.  Yeah.  This group would have been fucking, like, stampeded.  Oh, of course.  If they would have mentioned this, you know, a year later, even.  Right.  But now it's, oh, what are we coming up on, 10th year anniversary?  Ah, fuck it.  Yeah, sure, sue.  Do this.  Don't give money to the people that were down there that are now getting cancer and stuff  from being on site for the recovery effort and the rebuilding. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, don't give them any kind of medical care.  Mm-hmm.  What?  Could you imagine the day after?  Remember on the West Side Highway, it was all the fire trucks driving back and forth and  construction trucks and whatnot.  And there were people with American flags just cheering these people going back and forth  to the site.  They hung out every day just to do that.  Yeah.  They hung out.  Everybody was cheering.  It was great.  These are, you know, heroes. 
[02:42:30]  And now that they're dying of lung diseases and whatnot from doing that, they're just kind  of cast aside, well, you know, we can't really prove that it was that that did it.  It's like, you know, how many people were really involved that are now sick that you can't  fucking maybe take care of these fucking people?  Oh, regardless, maybe, maybe there's this chance that it wasn't the work they did on  the site that gave them that particular disease. 
[02:43:00]  But you know what?  It probably was.  And who gives a shit if it was or wasn't?  I'd rather err on the side of take care of someone who didn't get it there than ignore  somebody who did.  Oh, of course.  Who the, what scumbags are making this decision?  I'd rather give it to them than free health care to some fucking freeloading cunt.  Or just to another country.  Yeah.  I'd rather give it to them than fucking funnel money into Egypt or Pakistan just so they  fucking do what we want in the United Nations. 
[02:43:30]  I'm so fucking tired of that shit.  Tired of it.  When I hear how much money we're giving other countries for no fucking reason except what,  just for good PR, we're going broke, you dumb fucks.  How about you stop, you cut everyone off.  And if, if, if, uh, their, their government falls because we are stopped supporting them  too bad, then so be it.  Sorry, we're broke.  I was saying, it's like, it's like, it's like not paying your mortgage to pay the neighbor's 
[02:44:00]  fucking mortgage.  Fuck that.  When things get better, then you go, all right, well, you know, maybe we could kick in a few  bucks for you savages.  Yeah.  But for right now, uh, you know, we're having some hard times ourselves.  Yeah.  It seems like desperate times.  So you would think that we would have to do just basic shit to get our shit back together.  What politicians against that?  What, who are they representing?  They're supposed to be our representatives.  They're supposed to do things that, that, uh, we want them to do.  Who the fuck, what American wants to send billions of dollars to these shit fuck countries? 
[02:44:30]  None.  So who are you representing?  And who's voting to, to not give these guys the money?  Yeah.  Who, what fucking, I guarantee you it's, it's in a bill of something else.  No one is just coming.  None of these, none of these guys are just going, no, no, no.  They probably, as they say, pork barrel or whatever they do.  Oh, they tack a bunch of other shit on the bill and they're like, well, you're the one  that didn't want to. 
[02:45:00]  And then the political ads go, he voted not to give, uh, the, the, uh, workers at  ground zero healthcare money.  It's like, oh yeah, because there's 20 other things in the bill that sucked ass.  Who's saying no to it?  I want to know who, who the fuck is saying no to giving these guys money?  Again, there's no real accountability.  No, we're dumb.  It's so fucking, this country's so fucking doomed with these assholes in office.  Both sides too.  Both sides.  Republicans, Democrats, it's both sides.  We, they just, they turned into just shit, not working in the people's interest at all. 
[02:45:30]  And they found a way to blame each other.  It really is genius.  Like when you listen to a guy who really knows who he's talking about as a Republican, you're  like, God, the Democrats are retards.  And then when you listen to a Democrat or a democratic strategist who really understands  politics, you're like, you know what?  The Republicans are money hungry, cocksucker.  There is absolutely no, uh, you're right.  They figured out a way to blame each other.  The determination by Dr. John Howard, the National, National Institution for Occupational  Safety and Health comes in its first review of cancer as a potential trade center related 
[02:46:00]  health effect.  Another review is planned for early next year.  Oh yeah.  I'm sure there's a bunch of people going, yeah, I'll just wait till next year.  So one guy made the determination?  My mesothelioma.  Isn't that wonderful?  One guy?  Oh, Jimmy, you were, you were out of the studio.  We're talking about the atheists, uh, suing because they don't want to cross down at the  memorial.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's always got to be some fucking attention whores, me, me, me, me, me, look, you have  the right to be an atheist, but if you can't see that, look, I understand separation of 
[02:46:30]  religion and state, but we do have a certain, I guess, religious, there are religious people  in this country and they want to cross at the fucking memorial.  I think that it should be allowed.  But who's saying it's a cross?  I mean, can't they just say, look, this is something that survived the whole thing and  it's certainly an interesting symbol and we're going to just have it, uh, down there at the  memorial.  And it did help people, you know, spiritually that were really affected by it.  Right.  Uh, so you know what, how about an exception to a rule?  Um, because that isn't, I don't see that as separation of church and state, that kind 
[02:47:00]  of thing.  I agree.  I don't see that.  Uh, but you know, and it did survive like that and it did mean something to people.  I, the atheists I think will lose because even though it looks like a religious symbol,  it was not designed as a religious symbol.  Um, it was simply the wreckage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was saying they didn't nail Jesus, uh, a Jesus statue to it and make it, it's a crucifix,  you know, but that meant something to the people that were there.  You fucking dirtbag atheists, like be an atheist. 
[02:47:30]  You're fine.  But if you have to sue for that, that meant something to the people who were right.  There, and who lost friends and coworkers in, in the fucking, in the attacks, like the  guys that were down there, that meant something to them.  So for you to sue for that, you're just shit.  Yeah, you are.  You're just shit.  Just let that one go.  Jesus.  All right.  We're doomed.  Uh, breaking news.  One of the guys that founded the band America has passed.  Passed who?  Horse with no name.  Was that the song, right?  Oh, there's no horse with no name. 
[02:48:00]  I gotta give it a name.  Frank.  That's actually the, uh, the long version.  Oh, is that the original?  Yeah.  Dan Peake, founding member of, uh, the band America Dies.  What did he do?  Did he sing?  Singer of high harmonies.  Oh, he did the high harmonies.  I bet you if you scared him, you would go, hey, Dan Peake, a boo.  Ha, ha, ha.  High harmonies.  You know what that means.  High harmony?  Harmony to smoke the wacky tabacky.  That means he, uh, you know, liked the stick. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, I'd stick.  It's a Mary Janes.  Oh, wow.  I'm a dude.  Drug lingo.  Yeah.  You're cool.  Yeah, I was watching Breaking Billy.  What?  Horse with no name, right?  Ventura Highway.  Oh, right.  They did that one.  Ventura Highway in the summertime.  Oh, yeah.  Give us some America there.  The road to all conspiracies is on Ventura Highway.  Get it?  He's an asshole.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:49:00]  He also did Sister Golden Hair.  I like that song.  Give us some Sister Golden Hair.  I want to hear his high harmony.  Simpler times, huh?  Simpler times.  I believe Anthony asked for something that's being ignored.  Oh, he's looking, I'm sure.  Oh, there it is.  Some folk, folk-y music. 
[02:49:30]  I like this one.  Turn this up.  What did I think this was?  The Eagles?  Might be the Eagles.  How's it going?  John Garubi.  But I got so damn depressed  That I set my sights on Monday  And wait for the high harmony  I got myself on grass  I ain't ready for the altar  But I do agree there's times  When a woman sure can be a friend of mine 
[02:50:00]  But I keep on thinking about you  Sister Golden Hair's a place  I just couldn't live without you  Can't you see it in my eyes?  But I've been one, her, I always won  I've been too, too, far  Doent  To defend  Ma  Toodley  Doodley  Doodley 
[02:50:30]  Doodley  Doodley  Totally  Doodley  Doodley  Doodley  In my eyes  Will you make me in the air?  Will you leave me in the air?  Will you love me just a little?  Teach me a night to show me good  I think I try to fake it  I don't mind saying  I just can't make it  Toodly doodly doo  God, that's a fucking good song, man 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, man  You're right, dude  I thought it was Eagles  Yeah, it's got that vibe to it  A little bit  What else do they have?  What are the songs?  I mean, those are the three biggies  I didn't know  That's just a golden hair?  I don't think I know Tin Man  Tin Man, you know  It's so repetitive  I know how that goes  I'm a tin man  A man made of tin  I'm a tin man  I've got tin as a hat and shoes 
[02:51:30]  I'm a man of tin  A tin man  Clanking about the town  You know what really gets me?  Sam walked in in the middle of that with a disc  And doesn't even bat an eye  He had no idea why Jimmy's singing this Tin Man song  And doesn't even blink  He just knew that the music was good  Why fight it?  Of course 
[02:52:00]  Just nothing phases anybody  Once in  Tin Man  Who's he ripping off?  Was it the Styx guy or the REO guy?  That went kind of fruity and did Broadway  Oh, yeah, yeah  Well, it could be either of those two, right?  It kind of had the same type of vocal thing going on there  Tin Man  I'm a tin man  A man made of tin  Oh, I'm a tin man  Dennis DeYoung, yes 
[02:52:30]  When he got all opera on it  That's horrible  A man who sounds like tin  Can we hear Tin Man now?  You are  Yeah, see?  That was right  I clank to and fro  I'm a man made of tin  I'm not out, I'm in  I'm a tin man 
[02:53:00]  Sometimes when things are bad  People share the gifts of men  Hope it doesn't rain  And get me all creaky  Cause I'm made of tin  But I'm a man  A man made of tin  Is a tin man  Is a tin man  Not made of metal  Or plastic  Or cloth  I'm made of tin  I'm made of tin  That makes me a man of tin  A tin man  You're made of flesh and bones 
[02:53:30]  You can cry  I can't or I'll rust  Cause I'm made of tin  A man of tin  Is a tin man  My hands are made of tin  My hands are made of tin  My knees and elbows made of tin  My ears are made of tin  My ears are made of tin  I'm a man of tin  That's the song  I like that version  A lot better  Thank you very much  One guy's asking  How old are we? 
[02:54:00]  How old are you, ass fucks?  You don't remember some of these songs  Even if you're younger?  Yeah, I mean  Come on  Come on  Ray in Virginia, what's up?  Played him for a while  Hey guys  Hey  This fucker didn't sing those hits  He sang Lonely People  He was the falsetto kind of dude  Oh, fuck him then, man  We don't know him  Yeah, he's just a high  Turn it off  Actually, it was  I don't know  Probably top ten  Oh  What was it called?  Lonely People  Look at all the lonely people 
[02:54:30]  What do  What?  Or how do  Look at all the lonely people  Little life will pass you by  Don't give up until you  Reach for the silver  Can we hear it?  You're fucking weird  There's actually nothing like that, Ant  Yes, it is  Is it the only one he sang, really?  While he sang another one called  Don't Cross the River  Oh, yeah  Don't pay the ferryman  The man?  Don't even fix that price  Don't pay the ferryman 
[02:55:00]  Chris the bird  I know  Eleanor Rigsby  I know this one  These fuckers  Had a lot of songs we know  Yeah  Thinking that life  Is passing by  Oh, gotta beat  Like Coward of the County  Oh, there he is  Don't give up until you  Don't give up until the silver comes  That's him  He's dead  And ride that  All right, that guy  He's no longer with us  Don't give up until you  Thank you, Ray 
[02:55:30]  This is for all we see  I was listening to stupid Amy Winehouse yesterday because of Jimmy  Oh, really?  What song?  Fuck  There's a  What's that tear song?  That one I fucking love  And the video was really cool  I guess they cremated her  She's  Oh, she did  Funeral held for Amy Winehouse  Cremated  And now they're sitting  Sitting shiver  They should probably close the windows or something  If it's cold  Taking a shiver  Yes, it's a shiver  Let's start over 
[02:56:00]  This fucking broad was sexy too  Before the heroin  Yeah, heroin got her  He's got that exotic look or something  That's feet I'm here, dude  Tears dry on their own  I know I had them at my match  But every moment we get snatched  I don't know why I got so attached  It's my responsibility  You don't own nothing to me 
[02:56:30]  But to walk away  I am local president  He walks away  The sun goes down  He takes the day  But I'm wrong  And in your way  Very Motown sound to her  Definitely  It's not like  It's not like an old  60's Motown sound  Yeah  You like this?  Yeah, yeah  You do  This ain't bad  When there's so many  Real things at hand  We could've never had it all 
[02:57:00]  We had to hit a wall  So this  Left to fall  Yeah, it's got that fucking  Barrett Gordy sound  Going on there  Look how sexy she looks  She fucked it all up  Yeah, I play myself  Yeah  Should just be my own best friend  I fuck myself  In the head  With a stupid man  He walks away  The sun goes down  Yeah, real 75's in these days  Yeah, yeah  But I'm wrong  And in your way 
[02:57:30]  In this blue shade  My tears  Lie on air  Oh  So we are  Here's the way  The shadow  Oh yeah  There is something about  Fucking offing yourself  Early  Because I never would've  Fucking been sitting here  Listening to this  And it's kind of like  Wow, yeah  It's fucking pretty good  Somebody yelled at me  On Twitter yesterday  Because I said  She sang as well as  Morrison or Janice  She did  Just because she's in our time  It doesn't mean that  She was not as good 
[02:58:00]  As those legendary people  She didn't have  As many big songs  But her voice  She's got a ridiculous voice  Amazing  Hey, Janice got up there  On stage live  And shit the bed  Because of heroin  A lot of times  Sure  Babbling  Morrison did the same thing  I just love the hook  In this song  It's all about the hook  No mountain high enough  Ain't no valley low enough  Ain't no river wide enough  To keep me from getting to you babe 
[02:58:30]  This is kind of a reply  Huh?  Is that a wig?  Oh yeah, it's gotta be a wig, right?  Yeah  You know what's a good tune?  Did you hear Amy, Amy, Amy?  Amy, Amy, Amy  I fucking  I've been listening to that song  Is that from her?  Oh yeah  Let's check it out  That's what I think  Off Frank  Her first album  I believe  You listen to Adele?  No  Has an Amy Winehouse vibe to her?  Oh no  I think she says that  Amy was an influence  You haven't heard Adele?  No  Oh fuck yeah, you have  Adele?  After this we'll play  The Adele song for Jimmy  He'll be hooked immediately 
[02:59:00]  This is Amy, Amy, Amy  Amy Winehouse  Yeah  It's about how much  She wants to fuck guys  Boom, boom  Oh, that's Bob Eatman  By the way  On the French horn  French horn  On his garage  Being piped in via satellite  Ha ha ha ha  Yeah  Attract me  Until it hurts  To concentrate  Distract me 
[02:59:30]  Starts me doing work  I hate  Just to show him  How it feels  I walk past his desk  In heels  One leg resting  On the chair  From the side  He pulls my head  Amy, Amy, Amy  Although I've been here before  Amy, Amy, Amy  He's just too hard to ignore  Masculine, you spin a spell 
[03:00:00]  I think you'd wear me well  Amy, Amy  No, he's dead  Where's my moral parallel  It takes me  Half a night to ride over  Good evening  Victim on the morning  Whoa, whoa, girl  No, he's dead  Try the wine  I love it 
[03:00:30]  You just turned me on  To a new song, man  I love that  Fucking phenomenal  Yeah, she was fucking talented, man  She was great  Yeah, come on  I think she should be  In the 27 Club  Without a doubt  Let's do that  Let's put her in the 27 Club  Yeah, we're actually  The people that are allowed  To admit people into that  No one knows that  We were appointed  Many years ago  You want to hear Adele?  I can't  Okay  You had to have heard Adele  Oh, that's where the farmer is  Travis, you know the hit song?  No, no, no  No  You're not getting away with that 
[03:01:00]  There's a farmer there or something  There's a farmer and Adele  The farmer and Adele  No  Hey, have some Cheerios  There's a farmer and Adele  Here's Adele  What's the name of the song?  Rolling in the Deep  Rolling in the Deep  This shit  Is she alive?  Oh, yeah  I have no idea  She does sound a little like her  I can see you crystal clear 
[03:01:30]  Go ahead and sell me out  And I'll lay your picture  Anything yet?  Well, she's alive  I'm not really feeling it  They have to be dead for you?  I think  Dead to me  Put a picture of Adele up  She's good  Oh, bless her  I see what she looks like  Might be the wrong color  Oh, yeah?  No, she's white  Is she?  I had no idea  I just assumed by the voice  Ah, yuck  What a fat pig 
[03:02:00]  Yuckaroo  She looks like Miss Romano  Oh, my God  Miss Romano from fucking  Oh, God, yeah  One day  One day at a time  Throw that ball in your feet  Oh, I hate that  Wow  Why did you ever show me a picture of her?  Adele  I hate her now  She's fat  She's  Yeah  She's fatty with a short haircut  Yeah  Oh, my God  Boy, she looks like the one from Saturday Night Fever  That wound up fucking all of Travolta's friends in the backseat  Ms. Romano 
[03:02:30]  You didn't like that song?  Yeah, Ms. Romano  So, upon your feet  Upon your feet  Oh, man  The record company blew it  They should have got a young, sexy, black woman to represent Adele  And just say, this is Adele  Yeah, like they did with what?  What was that band?  Milli Vanilli  Milli Vanilli  Do a little Milli Vanilli with her  All right  That's Adele  That's like a Mama Cass thing  They get a great voice  And fucking  How old was Mama Cass when she fucking croaked? 
[03:03:00]  22  No, she was older than that  22?  She was older than that  Amy Winehouse definitely belongs in the 27 Club  M.I.A. did a song called 27  This was recorded before Amy Winehouse died  Oh  You want to hear a little piece of it?  32  Okay  What?  Mama Cass was 32  You lied about me  It's 22  I know  It's 32  I believe it  You're going to believe Wikipedia?  That shit is half wrong all the time  Sure  I'm telling you, 22  That's not true 
[03:03:30]  22?  Cass Elliot  Tutu  M.I.A. is just one person  What's this?  27  Club  That's pretty good  I liked it 
[03:04:00]  M.I.A. is just one person  Oh, is it?  Yep  Is she the one with the fucking gun?  Yeah, that's from Slumper Manor  Fucking love that song  Yeah  M.I.A.  What is she missing?  In Adele?  She's so fucking fat, that lady  I hope she fucking falls on a train  And gets her legs cut off  And she has to be big and fat  With no legs  Very, very nasty  Chip 
[03:04:30]  Fucking hate  Fuck her  Chip is never  Fuck her  Wow, Chip is really on fire  This is what you guys don't realize  Like you gotta actually  Chip on Opie and Anthony  Just pipes in little one-liners  Because he wants to be like  One of the guys  One of the comedians  If you actually spend time with Chip  I mean, within a couple sentences  Of just letting him talk  Is hateful  You realize, yeah  There's a problem  I mean, there's violence in his past  He was obviously abused  Really bad when he was younger  Yeah  Maybe you were 
[03:05:00]  No, I think you were, Chip  I think you were  Yeah  And he's trying to cover that up with humor  But he doesn't have any humor  So instead  He just reverts back  To the horrible things  That happened to him  Yeah  Why do you have to push out  The first half of humor?  Humor  Humor  It's like costume  Humor  I suck at talking  And I'll be the first to admit it  I suck at talking  But humor  I have an original dialect  You push that first half  Humor  Humor  Humor  Humor  That's a really good word  And it's just a little thing 
[03:05:30]  I know, but  Yes  Humor  Humor  Here's the H-U sound  You're using too much air  In the first half of the word  Humor  You don't need air for more  Just go humor  Humor  Humor  You're right, he is  Humor  Humor  Humor  It's a distinct dialect  Yeah, it's called  From the town of dumb  That's not bad, Chip  Thanks  Yes it is  No, it's not  I got a question  We got  Stupid asshole  We got more  See what I mean?  We do have more Chip audio  But I gotta ask 
[03:06:00]  If this Ohio cop  Suspended thing is good  Or the kangaroo  Attacking the old lady  Is good  I think you should hop  Do it  I mean, I feel like  Everybody's in a Chip mood  Right now  Unless you want to  Save it for tomorrow  Go Chip  I would go Chip  The cop stuff is good too  But you could definitely  Do it tomorrow  And do a whole thing about it  What's wrong with Larry?  Larry!  Hello, fuckers  What's up, Larry?  Hey  I hope Adele hears the replay  You go, hey, let's pull a picture  I believe it  Ah, yuckaroo 
[03:06:30]  Did you say yuckaroo?  I only save yuckaroo  For something that's really  Yuck, yuck, yuck awful  I can't see it  But I'm sure it's awful  Look, man  I'm still trying for catchphrases  I got a whole line of t-shirts  Coming out soon  Yuckaroo  I hope y'all have some more  Humor  Humor  Humor  I'll tell you why, man  Humor  I do like Adele's music  There's a few other songs  That are pretty cool  And I really had this vision  That she was a young  Black singer 
[03:07:00]  Nice boobies  The right color black  By the way  You know what I mean  Yeah  Something you could take  To family functions  Without too many people  Piping up  Giving you some shit  Yeah, not the dark ones  That throw your mother down  On the bathroom floor  When they're trying to be  Fixing the tiles  And spackling  Oh  See what I mean?  Yeah, that didn't sound good  And I do have some kind of thing  For black women  I had this whole fantasy  Then we pull up her picture  And she's a fat pig  Why don't you just appreciate  A white fat pig  I have 
[03:07:30]  Have a good day  Later  You don't think she gets  To be more attractive  Because she's talented?  Am I crazy?  Look, man  If I was the record label  I'm serious  Because Adele sounds  So fucking sexy  I would have like  Just really put it off  You know  Putting that picture out there  But isn't it a good thing?  I would have just kept  Putting it out  Like, no, no  She's got the flu  You know  No photo session today  Or bring out a black girl  And go, well  We wanted her to sing  And go, well  Her voice  She's got to save it  She's got a big concert  Coming up  Well, wouldn't it  Actually, you can't even 
[03:08:00]  Have her do concerts  At first  Wouldn't it be a good thing  That this is, you know  And how awful  Is this broad?  Terrible  But he gives other girls  Something to strive for  Well, good for them, man  Fat, unattainable  Eat and you'll attain it  Well, no, I meant talented  It's not just  You have to be fat  To be famous  Oh, he's not there  He's not at the floor  I saw Travis back there  Duffy was cool  And she was sexy  And we introduced her  At a big corporate event  Where we told the whole place 
[03:08:30]  To go fuck themselves  And we never really  Talked about that  But we were fired  Soon after that  They didn't know  How to take jokes  They were all kissing  Each other's ass  And we're like  We want you and Ant  To do a few minutes up there  So, boy, did we give them  A few minutes  I wish someone taped that  Yeah  Turns out  The guy that was  Ahead of programming  Was a contest pig  Yeah  They had a whole video  Of him  You know  Him bragging  That as a kid  He loved radio  And he would call in 
[03:09:00]  For all these contests  And stuff  And it was supposed  To be a nice moment  And me and Ant  Walked out there  And called him a contest pig  In front of all the  Big fucking suits  We were just being funny  It was great  They didn't like it as much  They flew in executives  From all over the country  And were trashing  The main guy bad  Way past what you would do  For a roast  She had Chip right for you  Yeah  Ah, that would have been good  Speaking of Chip  Let's get into this  More Chip from Comic Con  Chip talks to a guy  From Aliens  And a pretty girl  What? 
[03:09:30]  Let me ask  Hey, dude  What's  It looks like you got  Like red lobster  Or something  It's a million  Facehugger  What's that?  It's an alien  Facehugger  From the movie  Aliens  Endeavor  Does it hurt?  A facehugger  Oh  Does it hurt?  How do you keep it on there?  Is he actually  Holding on to something?  With love  Oh, that looks  Oh, that's cool  I thought that was  Like a spider  Or something  From a movie  I've seen a movie  Alien 
[03:10:00]  Abductions  Close  Close enough  That's scary though  Why was he on your  Chinny chin chin  Like that?  I don't know  I have no idea  Okay  That's like a ray gun  Or something, right?  Yeah  It fits the whole suit  That's cool  Does it make a noise?  I had a ray gun  When I was a kid  Really?  But I would  Yeah, I would always  Point it at the girls  Make them take off  Their clothes and stuff  And rape them  Not a good idea  Oh, look at the legs 
[03:10:30]  On this one  She'd show her your gun  Where are you from?  I'm from San Diego too  How come she's in that chair?  Oh, wait  Pause that for a second  I believe there's a woman  In a wheelchair  Oh, yes  Right next to us  And then Chip  No  Just points to the woman  And says  How come she's in that chair?  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Chair  Oh  I can't go back  Oh  Where are you from? 
[03:11:00]  I'm from San Diego too  How come she's in that chair?  Oh  Alright, we'll see you guys later  I'll see you  I'll bet you she's faking  That lady's full of shit  I remember when I was a kid  We'd seen a lady in a chair like that  And we pushed her down the stairs  Why?  Because it was funny  She would smell real bad  She had brown spots on her  And we just pushed her down the stairs 
[03:11:30]  On the side  And she fell down  And her teeth fell out  We was kicking her in the mouth  Oh, look at that  Look at that thing  It's so red  That  It's a very  It's  She's wearing like  Little Red Riding Hood or something  Oh, look at you  What's with the hair  Like all red  Looks like she's a Brillo pad  Or something  Oh, God  Oh, God  He doesn't differentiate between 
[03:12:00]  He just said these horrible  Terrible things  Yes  And then goes right back into one-liners  Holy shit  I'm proud of Sam though  You're finally getting it  You're talking about him  Like he is a real person  Well, he is  He's a different entity  Because that's what's creepy  About this whole fucking thing  That most people don't get to enjoy  That  It's not Jim Norton  You're actually hanging out  With this made-up person  Well, when I spoke to Jim  He would ask me things about Chip 
[03:12:30]  But say like  What do you think of Chip?  As if he was a different person  Yes  What do you think of Chip?  Yes, that's what makes this so creepy  What do you think when Chip does this or that?  Yeah  It's a different guy  It's a different entity  Oh, boy  We have problems, guys  We got problems  Chip in Cleveland  Chip  What's up?  Hey, guys  I can't believe you guys keep trashing Odell there  I mean, what the hell?  Okay  Women singers  Can't we have a good singer  Instead of just a pretty chick  They have to auto-tune out the wazoo?  No  It's pretty pretty 
[03:13:00]  I think that's probably why they auto-tune Hot Girls  Because I think what happens  If you want a real answer  When you see that  A voice like Adele's  Comes out of a fat pig  You get depressed  Yeah, it's kind of like  Oh, boy  Who cares?  I don't  I get extremely depressed  Because there is a fantasy thing there  If you're going to be listening to  Fucking faggy music like that  You're at least thinking  Hot, black chick  Nice boobs  Probably doesn't wear bras  Half the time  Because she can get away with it  You got specific  She's got that nice fucking  Chocolate skin 
[03:13:30]  I don't know what black  Naked chicks you've been looking at  What happened?  The bras come in real handy  I'm thinking this girl's like  I'm thinking she's like 20  Yeah, well look  What's her face there  A nice full C  Probably  Fucking lose weight commercials  Or whatever  Jennifer Hudson  Jennifer Hudson  Oh, well, that's pancake tits  Yeah, she's so big  She should be a Hudson River  She lost weight  Perfect  Thanks  I just take the name  And I do something with it  Oh, I get it  It's like there's some  Awful fucking  Tits out there 
[03:14:00]  On a lot of the nudes  I've seen  In certain ethnic backgrounds  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  Just horrible tits  Alright, I guess you want  Her to look ugly and stuff  Well, I tell you  If you give me  One of the  Little challenges  Choices  Would I take  Adele  Right  Or  Jennifer Hudson  I would take  Fat Adele  Really?  Yeah  That's controversial  Is it?  I would think so  It's not  Controversy  Needs some kind of a 
[03:14:30]  Maybe something's one thing  Or the other  It's controversial  It's that  No, I'm  What's controversial about me  Just saying  I just want to be  With the white chick  I really thought  Jennifer Hudson  Was really hot  Yeah  Until her  Tits looked like  Onion soup  Onion soup  Where they pushed up  So much of it  That the cheese  Was falling over the side  That's what she looked like  With that push up bra  It was like  Pancake tits  She takes that fucking shit off  And it's just pancake tits  Horrible  All these chicks

Yeah I'm on his side right now  What about Kanye West?  I'm always wearing Kanye's side  Okay  I wear tight shirts  I was about to say  Because I've heard you describe things  That might be a little questionable 
[03:29:00]  As Kanye  You said that  Come on look at the shirt I got on  I love Kanye  It's because of him  That's true  So you're excited about  Watch the throne and all that?

[03:29:30]  We figure that a hip hop beef  And just gunfire  That's it  Like otherwise  This is a neutral though  I'm a neutral guy  What do you mean neutral?  You come on here and say  Eminem pissed on Mariah Carey  You said Jay Z  It's all jokes right?  He's still neutral  You know  What's his name sent me  $120 the other day?

Yeah so  Jay Z left at 4  Like around 4 or something  He hung out for like 45 minutes  Does Beyonce let him hang out 
[03:30:30]  With Rihanna anymore?  Because I remember  A long time ago  There was a little  They weren't together though  Questionable  Maybe it's still going on  Because that's why he left  Right  So I got the phone call  I'm trying to wind the club down  So I can leave  And go home to my orgy  You had an orgy waiting for you  Of course you did  Everybody saw me on Twitter with Jay Z  Then the orgies called me  Got you  Got you  So then Rihanna was like  Yo I'm coming over  So it was like 4 o'clock  And then I was like what?

You gotta get me a copy of this  Spencer Pratt rap song  I don't think you'll see this  It's very horrible  I mean  I think I got his sister coming up this  Because she got abducted  When she was young  With Dan Aykroyd  Because Dan Aykroyd got abducted  A long time ago  And she got abducted too  Both of them was inside the spaceship 
[03:42:30]  At the same spaceship?  Yeah, the same spaceship  And then she got probed  And he got probed  Did he probe her?  No, they both said it felt good  They lied  They both enjoyed the probing  I don't know if Dan Aykroyd  Got probed in the ass  Maybe  I don't know  Eric's been probed before  Eric  You've been probed?  No, he's lying  Yo, he did  No way  They probed you  No, Roland tends to lie  That's his other thing he does  Roland, are you confident  About your stand-up tomorrow?  I don't know  They say I can't do the rape jokes 
[03:43:00]  Or dead babies  I don't know  I don't have to be right  I don't have to be right  Roland's trying to  Make fun of management  Oh, okay  And that's his  Stephen Blatter  And you can't make fun of  The H-man  They said  Go ahead, Stephen Blatter  You know  The H-man  They say you cannot make fun of  For real?  Who's the H-man?  Who?  The man guy  Oh, the H-man  The man  You can't mess with him, man  Yeah, no, they say  You make fun of him  They go, bad things happen  No, serious?  Yeah  Oh, damn  We had his hairline  And LeBron's hairline  One time  Oh, competing?  It was like a battle 
[03:43:30]  But then LeBron's  Went to the back  LeBron won that battle  Maybe that's why  They get in trouble  No, you can't talk about  The H-man  But talk about Stephen Blatter  What are you  I mean  I'm not gonna talk about Stephen  He's my boss  He's, you know  You gotta talk to  Like  I mean, last time  You came on here  And you said  You went to a strip club  With him  Yeah, I went to a strip club  With him  But it's so funny  Because I came on a day  Where it was like  I guess it was like  What do you call that  Day when you don't wear a suit?  Casual Friday  Yeah, he was like  All casualed out  He had his new balances on 
[03:44:00]  It was ill, yo  I never saw like  Stephen Blatter  So ready to go  To a black strip club  You guys went to  A black strip club?  It was crazy  You look like  I don't know  Like that actor  That funny guy  I'll show you  Oh, jeez  Roland  Jesus Christ  See, this is  Roland, you gotta let people  Bury themselves  I'm not joking  Like  I see Who Kid doing this  I'm not jumping on this band  I'm just reading the note  You passed a friend of me  I'm sorry  I told him not to hand  In his credit card  And then they took  Like two G's off of it  That was done, huh?  For his singles or something  You didn't realize  It's all cash  It's an all cash  You better be paying cash 
[03:44:30]  I was a hood club  I wanted to show him  The hood environment  You know, where I come from  Did he enjoy it?  Stephen Blatter had a ball, yo  He loved it  He brought the New York  Time magazine in there  He was dancing  He had the New York  Time magazine on  The Sunday edition  And then he had it  All over their body  I was like  What are you doing right now, yo?  Stephen Blatter  Let's get out of here  You're insane  Listen  You know, we talked  Some racial stuff today  On the show  I'm gonna play a little clip  While we try to regroup  And regenerate 
[03:45:00]  And restructure ourselves  Because after that  I don't know where we go  We talked about  An Abbot and Costello bit  That Jim Brewer did  You know Jim Brewer  The comedian?  Yeah  He was in Half Baked  And all that stuff  He's been doing our  He did the Abbot and Costello  He did it over?  Yeah, but he did like  What if Abbot and Costello  Were racists?  And it's become a classic  This is from years ago  I don't know  I don't know how many years ago  But it was  It was from a while back  And we all enjoy 
[03:45:30]  And we all enjoyed it  Wow  Yeah, it's Jim Brewer  And Racist Abbot and Costello  Here on After Opie and Anthony Live  After Opie and Anthony Live  Oh my  What did you see, Lou?  Lou, you're delirious  What did you see, Lou?  Yeah, you saw a light in the sky, Lou?  Now I've taken a look, Lou 
[03:46:00]  And there's nothing there  I'm just telling you  There's no such thing  As flying saucers, Lou 
[03:46:30]  Now go to bed  So Dracula could come out  Of the wall behind  Right  Ridiculous  But I  But I'm just saying  Abbot  Came in  You can't be acting like this, Lou  We're in the army 
[03:47:00]  Abbot  They're always doing something wacky  We're in the navy, Lou  I forgot all about that  When the Japs would come  I love that old war propaganda  We're gonna kill us some Japs, Lou  Some stereotypical big buck-toothed Jap  Would come up behind them  Hey, Abbot  It comes a Jap  Abbot  We're 15 miles behind enemy lines  There's no Japs here, Lou  And there's the Jap with the bayonet 
[03:47:30]  Stop pointing that gun, Lou  There's nothing around here for miles  There's the Jap right behind him  But he keeps ducking  When Abbot turns around  You gotta see the visual of this  Dude, that's gotta be on TV, man  Oh, my stomach hurts 
[03:48:00]  That's hilarious  Ant, you make me sweat  There is no Frankenstein, Lou  They put all the monsters all together  Frankenstein, the werewolf, and Dracula  With Abbot and Costello  There is no whooping monkey  Now take this candle  Which barely puts off a flame  With your nightgown  And go to bed  I could listen to this all day 
[03:48:30]  God damn, I love that  Holy crap  Wow, that's funny  Hey, I just  Speaking of mummy  What's that behind you?  We've been digging here in Egypt all day  Now put the mummy on the truck  Put the mummy on the truck, Lou  Abbot  The blue cup 
[03:49:00]  Abbot  Well, Lou, we've made it to Mars  Get out of the spaceship  There's breathable air here  And there aren't any Martians  Holy  Abbot  Antennas  No such thing as little green men, Lou  Big eyes  I'm gonna lose my mind up in here 
[03:49:30]  Yo, Jim be raging, yo  Can't kill that nigga  Over, over greed  Dumont  God damn, dude  That's just brilliant  That's some funny stuff there, bro 
[03:50:00]  Well, here's the problem  It's the you know what  And we ain't getting into that, are we?  There's one behind you now, Lou  Abbot  A big  There's a whole lot of  Lou lost  They're Abbot  They ain't around for miles, Lou 
[03:50:30]  We're in Beverly Hills  Abbot  I'm at Jamaica  After ONA  Live  We had to get Who Kid out of here  Before somebody ends up getting fired  It's after Opie and Anthony Live  That was Jim Brewer from years ago  Doing the old Abbot and Costello bit  I don't know what Who Kid is doing  With Alien Abduction Weekend  Is Troy around?  Somebody find Troy  If Troy's listening 
[03:51:00]  675 Bar tonight, Sam  No, it's not  It's Wednesday  Is it Wednesday?  Yeah  Oh  Troy was DJ  Maybe that's actually a good point  Maybe that's why Troy was so  Moody this morning  Oh yeah, he was  Because he was  He was up all night DJing  Because somebody hung up  Fagito  First of all, it's nice to see  The Ron and Fez interns  Real cool  Ron and Fez interns  Do you have a show today?  Because I know you came in here before  Just grab them real quick  Just be brief  Yeah, we do have a show today  We are live 
[03:51:30]  You are?  Yes  Because remember on Monday  You were here  Yeah, we were here  You didn't have a show  No  Nope  What did you guys end up doing on Monday?  I just went back home  And?  Just uh  What happened to Carpe Diem?  I gave you a whole speech  About seizing the day  I worked on stuff for the show  Well then why didn't you tell me that  Before I yelled at you?  Sorry  That's okay  Can I ask a question?  I'm talking slower today  Does Mark Zito know there's a show today?  Yeah, he knows  What did you work on for the show?  Are we gonna  Because you  You did the Fez Blueberry song, right? 
[03:52:00]  Yeah  That was a great song  Yep  Are you still gonna do more song parodies?  Have you done any more?  Yes, I have  Have they made the air?  Have I just not heard them?  Yeah, I guess you haven't heard them  I miss them  Any really good ones?  Yeah, they all love them  Hmm  Well, maybe  Sometime on After ONA  I don't know if we can find them today  Sometime  We'll play some of them  Because that one was very well done  Is that what you were working on on Monday?  Yep  More song parodies?  What about you?  Pips, right?  Yeah  Yeah, what about you?  What did we do on Monday?  I just fucked my girlfriend the whole day, really  Okay  I mean, that's, you know 
[03:52:30]  It's fine  No, that's good  Because I'll tell you what  Not only is it a physical workout  It increases endorphins  And probably made your relationship stronger  Definitely did  So I think  I  Applaud both of you  I have to applaud that  For a good, fulfilling day  Can I say something quick?  Yo, what's your name again, dude?  What's your name?  My intern name is No Name  No Name  No Name  I think No Name does his nails  No Name  You do your nails or have them done?  Me?  No, I don't do my nails  Do you have them done?  They look very glossy and manicured  Oh, well, I do play classical guitar 
[03:53:00]  That's why  Oh  What?  I put that gloss over them  Oh, to harden?  On my picking hand  And look how long they are  Show, show, show  Save my hand  Not that long, I mean  Okay, but that's  So you put the clear stuff on  To harden them  Yeah  So they don't break  When it's drum really hard  And you keep them long  Yeah  Well, it makes sense  Well  I say it's, it's, it's  It makes sense  But you would see why I would question it  Yes  Yeah  But it is valid  I think  Because  Okay  I think if you were really like  You know, just doing it to make himself pretty  They wouldn't be long 
[03:53:30]  And if that parody wasn't so good  I'd actually, I'd actually believe he's a real musician  Right  He's a classic guitarist  Well, uh, keep up the good work  And set up this studio  It's not gonna set up itself, guys  Come on  You can't just sit here talking to me  Troy, uh  Was this morning, like  Especially rough since you were up late  At the DJ gig last night?  Yeah, I'm still up  Oh, you didn't go to sleep last night?  I mean, I, I laid down  There wasn't actually any sleep involved  You just got to be off your feet for a little bit  Yeah, I'm fine though  Because, I know you're fine now  But this morning you weren't  Because, I don't know if you 
[03:54:00]  You never questioned how  I got the information  That you were freaking out in the other room  I would imagine you got it from Eric  Because he's the only one in there that heard it  Eric, Eric  I can, I can tell them what you did, right?  Yeah, go ahead  Okay, it was, it was hilarious  Like, while the first break was going on  Uh, while Opie and Anthony were talking about  Uh, the, the lights  The management  And, uh, and their response to the lights  And everything  I was having trouble concentrating  Because in my left ear  In my head phoned  I could hear the Opie and Anthony show 
[03:54:30]  In my right ear  Eric turned his mic on  So just I could hear it  And I was listening to you  Just flip out on that guy  Oh  I mean, you were going insane  That's why I wrote the note  Yeah  Because you were going  Absolutely insane on this guy  I mean, as it turned out  The guy was a lunatic  Yeah  He probably deserved that  But, is that typical behavior?  It just  Answering the phones  Makes me psychotic  Because I heard you  You yelling at him  What the fuck do you want? 
[03:55:00]  You want me to take him out  Of the fucking studio  While the fucking show is on?  You know what you should do?  Get in your car  And drive off a fucking bridge  That's a quote  Well, yeah  I mean, he's  He wanted me to  He wanted to talk to Anthony  But he didn't want to talk to him on the air  I said, are you listening to the show?  I mean  Do you understand like that?  Like, are you fucking kidding me?  How quick was it  When you lost your cool?  It was pretty quick  It was  Because I'm just talking to him  He's like, I want to talk to Anthony  Okay, what would you like to talk to Anthony about?  It's private  Well, what do you mean it's private? 
[03:55:30]  It's me going there  And right there  You're like  What kind of a fucking idiot  Says it's private  And calls a radio show?  Yeah, I'm like  Are you listening to the show?  He's broadcasting  So, let me get this straight  You're asking me to pull him out of the studio  Yeah  To come talk to you on the phone  And that's what he was asking  And then he would just go  I want to talk to Anthony  And I'm like  And my blood pressure goes to the roof  Yeah  They need to put a punching bag  Back there  They do  Eric  I can, I can, I can  Eric, does Troy ever take any of his frustrations out on you? 
[03:56:00]  No  What does he do?  He knows  How does he release it?  He usually never releases it  Because  That was the longest I've seen Troy get aggravated at a caller  But I've seen him get pissed off before  Never lasts that long  And then he'll hang up  And then it's just quiet  And you hear  Is that what it is?  Yeah  Try the exhale  And then he's back  And he's just sitting there  And he's just deadly quiet  And does not react until the next phone call  Is it phone screening in general?  Or is it this show in particular 
[03:56:30]  That you think is difficult to screen?  This show in particular is difficult to screen  Because of the listeners involved?  Well, I mean  I'm sure Cosmo's pretty easy  Because people just  They just fly off the handle  And they just start screaming  And they have bad phone connections  And it's like  And you're like  I've heard people say that  The cell phone kind of killed talk radio  Yeah  You know?  And people are just  They're fucking idiots  I mean, I try to speak very clearly  What's your name? 
[03:57:00]  Where are you calling from?  And they just start screaming  And they start to  And it's just  You know  Four hours of it  And I just  I want to fucking kill people  I love them to go  Seriously?  Are you fucking serious?  Today it was  It was three minutes in  Which is why I was  My jaw dropped  Because three minutes into the show  You were tearing the room apart  Because the guy was just  A complete fucking idiot  I mean, as it turned out  The guy  And if you missed the beginning of the show  Which I'm sure a lot of you did  Listening at this hour  You gotta listen to the replay 
[03:57:30]  Because  I know I tell you that all the time  But you should  I mean, you should  It's always a good show  But today's show was particularly good  This guy  The reason he ended up calling  Was  He was obviously drunk  He had to be  Yeah  I would assume  He was intoxicated  And he was making claims  About wanting to kill his ex-wife  Yeah  He was insane  Yeah  So  As it turned out  You know  Troy was right to scream at him  Because he was a maniac  But  You didn't maintain your cool very long  Right  How are you feeling about tomorrow?  I'm feeling fine, actually  You know, whatever 
[03:58:00]  Whatever  Eric  Said he's confident  About his set  He's confident?  That's what he just said  Right, Eric?  Yeah  Why are you so confident?  Because he wrote some stuff  And I think  Who wrote stuff?  I did  Did you?  Yeah  Oh  Okay  He's gonna  Try it out for some people today  He says  Who are you trying it out for?  None of your business  His wife and cat  You see  Are you trying your  Are you  Or are you just going for it?  I think I'm just gonna go for it 
[03:58:30]  Yeah  I don't really have any access  To comedians  Outside  That's what you think Eric's doing?  I think so  That's why he won't say it?  Yeah  Because he's trying it out for comedians?  I think he's gonna try it out for sure  You're asking a comedian  To help you out?  Well I mean  He has access to a lot of  Comedians' phone numbers  Yeah Roland  It is  Roland was just saying  What a shame it is  To ask comedians  To help for Eric  Yeah  But he did it with  He did it  He did it in such a  Wait what were you saying Eric?  I didn't say anything  Oh I thought you were about to say something  Because  What do you think of Roland  Steve Sturniolo  Come in here  Come in here  Oh they have someone who knows comedy 
[03:59:00]  Well he works on the comedy channel doesn't he?  You know what tomorrow is  Shut up Eric  It's the  He said  He goes  He goes  Oh there's someone who knows comedy  Those have fun to work  Tomorrow is the staff stand up contest  Steve Sturniolo  You work on Raw Dog  Yes  Eric  Says that he is confident  About tomorrow  Not only is he ready  He's confident  About his comedy  Now I'll tell you  For me  I'll have three minutes  It'll be what 
[03:59:30]  It'll be what it is  I'm not gonna go out there  And  And shock the world  With three minutes of  Unbelievable comedy  It's not  I mean it's not what I do  But I'll be up there for three minutes  That's what I can promise  I'll be on the stage  For three minutes  Honestly  I would be  We talked about this in the office a little bit  After I heard about it on the air  Yeah  I would be scared shitless  And I think that's the right attitude to go in  Be like  I'm not gonna rock the world  I'm not gonna be the funniest person alive  I'll be there  But you'll be there  You'll do what your mission was  To put on three minutes  Troy even said  Troy even gave me like a premise  That he was going on 
[04:00:00]  He just had to build out from it  And  I just wanted to eat in front of people  That's what  I think Eric's in a six foot sub on stage  I'm not even making a joke  It'd be hilarious  Eric has  Material  He says he's written  And he's confident  I heard some of it  He wrote material himself  I heard a few of them  Not bad  A few of his jokes  It's not bad  But Eric said that he is running material by people  That's such bullshit  And he won't tell us who it is  Now Troy  Maybe it's one of the 19 stand-up comedians  That work in this building  Troy is taking that to mean 
[04:00:30]  That  He's obviously running it through comedians  Is it comedians, Eric?  It's people in the business, yes  There's a hundred  Why do you do that?  Why do you do that?  And Roland, by the way  Oh, right, Roland  Why do you do that?  Eric  Right, Roland  I'm sick of that shit  Let me see the text messages on your phone, Roland  Who's Roland texting?  Uh, uh, uh, uh  Yeah  Who, Roland?  Because Roland  My friends  Well, Roland knows everyone comedy-wise  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute  Roland  Yes  Uh, you were talking to me about somebody just the other day 
[04:01:00]  Oh  As a matter of fact, you told me  You know, this comedian, who's actually  Probably the hottest comedian there is right now  Uh, has become friends with me  Yeah, and it took him five years to form this relationship  He said  I was there  He said, you know, this comedian  Used to be, it was just like I booked him on the show  And it was what it was  But ever since this party  We've been friends and we've been talking  And you have his personal cell phone number 
[04:01:30]  Which you've told me many a times  Which comedian was that, Roland?  I remember  He has a show on FX, Roland  Which comedian was it?  Elijah Wood?  It wasn't Elijah Wood  I have the connection with Elijah Wood  For everybody that listened to Comic Con Radio  Yeah, but I didn't ask him for help  Wait, who?  Louie  Oh  I didn't ask him for help, though  Eric?  You didn't  Wait, Eric just  Eric said, let's check his text messages  Eric  Eric  I didn't think to check with a comedian  Until Roland was telling me  Who he was talking with  Who was Roland talking with? 
[04:02:00]  Who was Roland talking with, Eric?  And then once I was like  You know what?  God damn it  That's a good idea  I should try that  I'm not talking to any comedians  Because the integrity of this competition  Has been shot already  I'm not talking to any comedians  Eric  Eric  Talk for me, buddy  I swear  You have done an effective job  Of taking the heat off you  Because you know what?  If you're talking to comedians  Because Roland is  Then our mission is to find out  Who Roland's talking to  Not you  We can't blame you  If Roland's doing it  I'll put it this way  Okay 
[04:02:30]  The people he's talking to  None of us would have access  To these people  Has the name  Has one of the  People, by the way  Steve Sterniello  Troy  Eric said people  Multiple  Oh  Has at least one of the people's name  Been mentioned in this conversation?  That is correct  Roland, you're a filthy liar  Wait, and you know what's funny?  You're a deceitful, filthy liar  How is that fair?  I know  Nagel's calling you out for people  And this motherfucker, Roland  Literally has contact 
[04:03:00]  To all the best comedians  Direct contact  With all the best comedians  Around right now  So Roland has gone to Louis C.K.  Eric  Yes  Can you drop me another name?  I will not drop names  Because I didn't drop  Louis' name  Roland brought that up himself  I brought it up  But there are people  Who have been on this program  Oh no  That Roland has  I will say  Friendships with  Oh no  Not just contacts  Friendships with  Friendships  And you know  Whatever Roland wants to reveal  That's up to him  If Travis is around 
[04:03:30]  I would like Travis to come down here  Because Travis is  Planning this whole  Hard Rock thing  So I need to know  I mean Danny is welcome  To come too  Travis is coming  But I would really like  To talk to Travis  About what's going on here  Because the shit  Has hit the fan  How is that fair though  It's not  If you're getting  A major comedian  To help write material  No no no  It's not writing  It's like  Just ask  What do you think  No  So you're getting  So you're getting  Louis C.K.  To punch up your set  That and here's what  I'm not using  The other guy 
[04:04:00]  Wait and these  Sacks of shit  No way in hell  They're just using  Him to punch it up  They're getting  Shit written for him  And by the way  Eric saying that  He's confident  Yeah  He's getting shit  Written for him  Obviously by one of the  20 comedians  That work in this building  Well the other guy  Oh god  Wait go ahead Roland  He has a TV show  The other guy has a TV show  As well  Yes  A couple  A couple TV shows  On the air  Huh  Joel McHale  That's it  I knew it  Don't let Roland  Tells me how good  A friend he is with Joel  This fucking asshole 
[04:04:30]  And Dane Cook  Oh this fucking dick  Wait  One two  Hold  One two three  Well I think there's four  There's another one  I think there's a fourth one  Who's the other one Roland  I'm not saying that  Listen  Cause Dane Cook  Was new to me  I didn't know about that  Oh you just  Dane Cook  Louis C.K.  But Louis  He was busy  So he was  Really I wonder what he was doing  Also Joel McHale  Who else  Who's the fourth  Who's the fourth horseman  Of the apocalypse  Jimmy Kimmel  Oh get the fuck out of here

[04:06:30]  Who works  I have heard that name  On the Howard Stern show  Yes and I know  That he works  I think it's only about  10 feet away from Eric  He's a Howard 100 news reporter  Very close to where Eric works  My defense though  Is some of the guys  Are lading him back to me  So I mean  They may not be able to  No no no no  That's not your defense  Because you're doing it  Travis have you been  Listening to this whole thing  Yes  Do you realize  What this has done  To the integrity of this bit  It's destroyed it  It has  Because Troy and me  Are sitting there  Like  Not just you and Troy  Yeah and you and Danny 
[04:07:00]  Yeah  And none of us  Are even close to stand ups  No  Troy's been on a stage before  But he's done music  I've been on a mic a lot  But it's doing radio shows  It's not doing stand up  And I'm just not funny  And you  Are notoriously not funny  Well I don't know  I don't know  And Danny  He's hilarious on production  Yeah  He's fine on the air  That doesn't mean you're a funny stand up  But he's never even done stand up  I haven't done it  And none of us have help  Yeah but you're asking  Joel McHale  Louis C.K  Dane Cook  And who's the other one  Jimmy Kimmel 
[04:07:30]  Wow dude  Is that true  Or are you making that up for the air  No I just emailed him  That's like getting batting practice  From Jesus  Yeah and by the way  You know like that's bullshit  By the way  If Eric gets shit  For getting help with his comedy  From somebody who works for Howard  Roland should get shit  For trying to get help from comedy  For somebody who does Howard's show  And won't do ours  Well that's not my fault  That's something to do with these two people  Wait can I just say something else  He sits in an office with E-Rock 
[04:08:00]  Right  So he's emailing all these big people  E-Rock's been confirmed  Or maybe there's this guy  That he's consulted with  One guy from the Howard show  Although no  But he said there's more than one  He said that's one of them  Eric  Who else is it  Who else isn't  The other person you do not know  Doesn't work here  He's never been on the show  Are they a comedian  It's Gittles  It's Gittles isn't it  It's Gittles  No  Is it a comedian  Somewhat yes  What's the name  Nobody you'd know  Is it Nathaniel Bryan  Because if so  That doesn't count as a comedian anymore  No it doesn't 
[04:08:30]  I'm actually just doing fan set  You are  The old  Your parents  Making out in the backseat  Of your car deal  Okay  We're not hooking up tonight  Right  I was a voice in Grand Theft Auto  I think the humor  The humor doesn't come in you guys  Being funny  I think the humor comes in  You guys actually writing  Your own three minutes  And whether you bomb or you don't  It doesn't matter  I think it's just funny  That was lost on Eric and Roland  Yeah because they have to cheat  You have to pass everything  Both of you  You disgust me  No I wrote my  Yeah once you get  You cheated three minutes  Once you guys get those  Comics for your channel  You can't  You can't  But anyways  And then I'll ask them to do
