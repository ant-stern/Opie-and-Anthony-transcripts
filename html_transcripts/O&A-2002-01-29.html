<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with discussions surrounding a planned call to former President Reagan, Mike Tyson’s potential Vegas fight, and the ongoing “Naughty Nighty” lingerie photo contest, receiving a high number of entries from Philadelphia but relatively few from New York City.  The show heavily featured the aftermath of Steve-O's previous day's appearance, which involved extreme stunts, substance abuse, and self-mutilation.  A call from a New Orleans cab driver, Ricky, recounted a sexual encounter with two lesbians and promised to send photos.  The hosts also discussed Steve-O's new DVD and speculated about his well-being, mentioning a planned call to check on him.  Plans for upcoming live broadcasts in Cleveland and Boston were discussed, incorporating the Naughty Nighty contest into the Boston event.  Kid Rock was mentioned as a desired but unavailable guest.

The broadcast detailed a chaotic night involving the hosts and Steve-O. This involved a roommate angered by a used tampon in his water, heavy drinking, a Spin Magazine party where a woman named D bit Steve-O's finger, leading to a fight and the hosts abandoning D, who later threatened their lives with a knife while searching for a woman named Alexa who had gone home with Steve-O.  The discussion then shifted to a Super Bowl ticket contest, featuring sexually suggestive and vulgar exchanges with a caller, Julie, who offered to host the winners in her New Orleans home but was rejected due to the presence of her children.  The hosts brainstormed alternative contest ideas involving increasingly outrageous and disgusting food challenges with their chef, Frenchy.  The segment further included a critique of Blender Magazine's "Top 20 American Albums of All Time" list, interspersed with vulgar jokes, racial slurs, sexually suggestive comments, and an audio clip of Steve-O performing a bizarre tequila shot.  Steve-O’s manager also called in briefly.

The show continued with a nonsensical discussion referencing Michael J. Fox and a “Cleveland steamer” (defined as defecating on someone’s face).  The hosts shared their own top 20 American albums, including Blondie’s *Parallel Lines*, the Ramones’ self-titled album, and Guns N' Roses' *Appetite for Destruction*. A caller, Marianne, inquired about the Cleveland steamer. The “Naughty 90s” contest was highlighted, featuring an in-studio contestant from Washington D.C. with approximately 95,000 photos taken by a producer, accompanied by explicit descriptions and crude sexual innuendo. A Hedonism III trip was also promoted. The focus then shifted to a discussion about Kandahar, Afghanistan, allegedly a historically gay city, exploring the Taliban's suppression of homosexuality and its return after their retreat. This discussion involved graphic descriptions of homosexual acts, child abuse, and the term "Ashna."  Multiple callers contributed, often using vulgar and offensive language.  A caller, Najee, attempted to provide cultural context, but was interrupted with offensive remarks.  The segment concluded with further vulgar exchanges, including a caller insulting a female caller ("Christina") who had previously performed a "queef" on the air.  Mike DiNicola and Pete Correale were in studio at the conclusion of this segment.

The final segment featured a phone call with Christy and Christina, engaging in a vulgar "queef off," encouraged by the hosts.  In-studio guests Pete Correale and Mike DiNicola commented on the absurdity. The hosts jokingly suggested chloroform to calm the callers.  The segment concluded with a winner declared and plugs for appearances at Caroline's Comedy Club and Bar 9, marked by extremely crude language and sexually suggestive themes.

[00:02:30]  i don't know  maybe it's so crazy  hey look we took a cab driver  we put him on the show  all right what's wrong with the phones  you're trying to tell me now one person in new york is trying to call us right now  hello  the national lines  the national lines are lit  and nothing is going on in new york  that doesn't make sense  they got the number  if you're in new york  877-692-1027  okay  could be a problem with the phone line  who knows  well come on  test it  not one person  this has never happened before  oh oh oh  might be working now 
[00:03:00]  all right there we go  very good  okay  bastards  hey how bummed are you that tyson didn't show up on larry king last night  yeah i was watching it  hoping to see tyson  and uh...  who do i see  connie chung  ask his fest on larry king  are they rescheduling or  um...  probably not  i was blown off  his peeps said  no  i was blown off my wrestling  to go check out uh...  tyson and larry king  i don't want to see 
[00:03:30]  lose his mind  hey larry  you know he'll go after larry  oh he will  he'll do like some fake biting thing  look larry i'm coming  i'm gonna stop it  stop it  ow  you know  it'll be funny  who wouldn't tune in  is larry stupid enough to go after him with the tough questions  and tyson's gonna show composure  no  and i think  the whole thing is uh...  they're going over it in vegas  whether tyson can fight in vegas or not  no brainer here  vegas like everywhere else struggling  after uh... the 11th 
[00:04:00]  this is exactly what boxing needs i swear to you  and you know  start thinking that boxing is uh... one of these respectable uh... sports  it's uh...  it's all about bloodletting and here you got it  you know something  it is  it's like my mom used to say  put on the fur coat  no  it's like my mom used to say  she said uh...  don't cut off your nose to spite your face  and that's what vegas would be doing  they're going broke over there  people aren't traveling to vegas  they're not spending money  and this is  somebody was calling mike tyson 
[00:04:30]  vegas's atm  whenever they need money  you put tyson in a ring in vegas  and televised it  you're gonna make a mint  no one cares about  and it's not like  this is some event  that needs some kind of  upstanding moral background  it's boxing  it's a sleazy industry  it always has been  so what the guy's a bastard  he's a kook  people pay more to see that  i will  absolutely  watch that fight  i haven't uh... 
[00:05:00]  paid for a pay-per-view fight in uh...  many years  this one  this one without a doubt  i'm there  i'm there  where do i sign up  tell me now  you want to see tyson  lose his effing  what little mind  he's got left  i want to see it  i want to see him  jump over the counter  like steve-o did yesterday  and go after larry king  no stop it  they will  i think they  they have to  uh...  say yes  he can fight  you know why  will we find out during our show  i think so  we should  right now right  yeah  i think uh... 
[00:05:30]  they know  if they don't give him  permission to fight in vegas  he's just gonna fight  somewhere else  he's been fighting other places  vegas is uh...  that's just cut out of the money  as far as his career goes  it's just a technicality right now  yeah  because if vegas won't have him  yeah you said it  they'll go somewhere else  because this fight is too big now  yeah it's huge  they know they can make a lot of money  and vegas like i said  hurting right now  thank the people in vegas  i saw a little bit of ratings  popping in vegas  a little bump up in vegas  wasn't that something  we got a little bump  i think it's time to visit vegas

[00:35:00]  secret message  for someone on  instant feedback  cj from jersey  oh don't start  giving out secret  messages  i know how those  guys talk  he just popped  a number up  that's all  stop  why is everyone  figuring out the  number  i didn't think it  was that obvious  uh mike  what are we gonna  do for a contest  alright you wanna  hear our dilemma  as far as uh  the super bowl  goes  let's go  this is typical  for our show too

No, I can't wait to see Daphna again.  Why don't you pick up something a little more provocative?  Who's buying?  Like a hot dog?  Huh?  Who's buying?  No, just a guy. 
[00:50:30]  A guy.  No, go through your closet.  I'm sure you've got some other, uh, things to get into.  Yeah.  All right?  Okay.  So, we'll see you, uh, Thursday.  Hopefully.  All right, Paul.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Bye.  And, uh, just in case you're keeping track at home, still no ladies here in New York coming  by for the Naughty Nighty Contest today.  Where's Earl?  I wish we could do this.  Paul from Center.  He says, I'm filling out my unlucky lottery card.  Here's my numbers.  He's got numbers.  He wrote down five numbers and Powerball number.  He has the one that everybody has. 
[00:51:00]  That's the Powerball number.  All right.  As you know, if you're a faithful listener to the show, we had Steve-O from Jackass on  yesterday with his, uh, drug-induced, uh, girlfriend.  Yeah.  And they were really, really effed up because they were just partying all day long.  Right?  Yes.  We have Steve-O's manager on the line for an update.  Hey, uh, Nick.  Yeah, what's happening, guys?  What's happening?  So what happened after the show?  Okay, well, I gotta, I gotta take you back to the night before the show to tell you this 
[00:51:30]  whole story, but it's, it's pretty good.  And, uh, the night before the show, we got into town, we were doing some drinking, and,  uh, one of our buddies, like, six months ago, when we were at, we stayed at this guy's house,  and, uh, one of our buddies last time had his hunting knife, and he started shoving it through  the door, just all drunk, just being funny, you know, the cheap door.  So the night before we went on the show, the same thing happened.  Well, what, what happens is, is the buddy we stayed with forgot to tell the, the drunk 
[00:52:00]  idiot friend who shoved the knife through the door that he got a new roommate.  So the morning that we're getting ready to go on your show, the guy comes back to his  door, just completely knifed up with a hunting knife sticking in it, and the guy's like,  what the hell's going on?  Well, he didn't know this, but D and Steve were sleeping in his room on top of that.  And then, you know, they were in there, it was kind of D's time of the month, so D took  her tampon out and put it in a glass drinking cup, and she'd forgotten and left it in there.  So the guy's going to make it, so he finds all this.  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, did all that make the radio? 
[00:52:30]  I would hope so.  Uh, D, D was having her time and took out, uh, what she uses to, uh, plug that up.  And there just happened to be a glass of water nearby where she just plopped it in the  drink of water.  Exactly.  Okay.  I forgot that she...  Okay, okay, okay, don't say anything, don't say anything, don't say anything.  Yeah, that's all we need.  Okay.  You got it explained.  All right, so what happened then?  Okay, so, so the guy's already real ticked off about the situation, you know what I mean?  So after we leave your place, you know how wasted those guys were.  Oh, yeah.  Nobody got any sleep.  After that, we kept drinking and drinking and drinking, and we got invited to the Spin Magazine 
[00:53:00]  party.  Right.  In solo.  So we go down to do the Spin Magazine party.  Steve-O's so...  They're both, they're both so wasted that it's like not even, it's not even English  coming out of their mouths anymore.  And D winds up biting Steve-O's finger for no apparent reason so hard that it starts  bleeding.  So they get in the big fight in the Spin Magazine party, and, you know, I'm like, okay, we're  getting that, we're just leaving.  So I grab Steve, and I take him to this other place, Tribeca Hotel, for this other party. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, boy.  And as we're going over there, you know, D shows, you know, D's coming with us, and  we're trying to lose her, and she's threatening now to put, you know, hits out on our life.  And so we basically ditch her.  Steve and I go in, I tell the door guy, don't let her in this place.  You know what I mean?  You just ditched D?  Yeah, we had to.  I mean, it was a terrible situation.  But, you know, it was more than that.  Like, she was, like, threatening our lives and cussing.  It just wasn't going to, you know, it just wasn't going to happen.  So we tried to buy her a cab.  She wouldn't get in the cab.  Just stick a C in her mouth. 
[00:54:00]  That'll shut it up.  Well, yeah, that's true.  But everyone...  Well, anyways, here's where the whole thing gets hit.  But everyone woke up this morning, right?  Yeah, so, yeah, so here's how he woke up.  That's the funny part.  Okay.  So we're at the Tribeca, Dardy, you know, and we run into some girls.  And Steve takes his girl, Alexa, home, you know.  But more sharing a cab than anything.  So he takes her.  We go back to our place.  She comes inside, smokes a cigarette, and then she takes off. 
[00:54:30]  And we finally pass out about 6 in the morning.  Now, I'm sleeping on the couch.  The shady attorney's sleeping on the other couch.  And Steve-O's laying on the floor, you know.  And he's finally asleep.  It's been well over probably maybe close to 40 hours since he slept.  God knows what drugs have been through his system.  He's finally getting some sleep.  About an hour and a half later, D comes in, wielding a knife, kicking him, going,  where's Alexa?  Where's Alexa?  What, you know, scream at him like just a complete hysterics. 
[00:55:00]  So I told her, I said, Alexa's in the room right here, which is the same room as the guy, you know,  the roommate who's already kicked off and just met us the night before with a tampon and a knife through his door.  So she kicks open the roommate's door, who doesn't know any of us for anything,  who's already ticked for staying there, holding a knife, screaming, where's Alexa?  This guy rolls over like, whoa, ah, he's scared of death, doesn't know what the hell's going on.  You should have gotten that on video.  I couldn't find it. 
[00:55:30]  I was out of tape.  I was out of tape and I was out of battery.  I wanted it on video so bad, but it was happening so fast, you know.  So anyway, D's holding a knife, threatening Steve-O.  Steve-O's completely dumbfounded because he's so wasted.  He's now awake.  You know, he's pretty much in a coma.  He's now awake.  With D kicking him and threatening his life with a knife.  And I don't know.  From that point on, it kind of tempered down a little bit.  But needless to say, this guy, the roommate of the buddy we're staying with, is a little  shooken up about it. 
[00:56:00]  Is Steve-O sleeping right now?  Yeah.  Well, we put Steve-O on a plane this morning at like 10 o'clock and we left D at the house  where she did that.  So D stayed at that house, I suppose, until I just kick her out, I guess.  She's a free spirit.  So we kind of just left a time bomb sitting around there.  I don't know if it already exploded or if it's still going to.  Classic.  It was pretty funny.  You've got to get Steve-O to call us today.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know what it's going to be today.  It's probably going to be tomorrow. 
[00:56:30]  That's fine, too.  Yeah.  I checked out the whole DVD last night.  I was laughing so effing hard, man.  There's some real sick crap on there.  Yeah, totally.  It's a pretty funny DVD.  Cool.  So, anyways, what time do we have him call in tomorrow?  Anytime, bro.  We're here.  Okay.  Sounds good.  I'm giving you a shot around like 4 o'clock tomorrow.  I'm sure he can tell you the story from his perspective, which is pretty hilarious.  All right, Nick.  Hey, we had a great time yesterday.  Yeah, we did, too, man.  We really appreciate it.  All right.  You guys keep rocking, man. 
[00:57:00]  Thanks, Nick.  I'm late.  Steve-O's manager.  Dickie from Jersey saying, Ben-Hur was filmed in less time than that guy's story.  He's been busy, I guess.  All right.  A little flustered.  There's a little development here.  Earl, you liked that last one, didn't you?  There's a little development here.  We're going to Boston.  We're going to broadcast live Friday from WBCN.  Coming with us, Earl?  You coming, Earl?  Coming to Boston?  Nice.  We're going to bring the whole crew. 
[00:57:30]  And we got a pair of tickets to the Super Bowl, Anthony.  And as we announced a little while ago, we don't have a way to get you there.  And you don't have a place to stay.  But we got the tickets.  Tickets.  And Ben, being from Boston, says, hey, man, they're so hardcore.  They don't care.  You give them a pair of Super Bowl tickets Friday.  They'll jump in their car Friday night.  And they'll get their asses down there and worry about it when they get there.  Right.  So I think contest is going to be on for Friday, okay?  There's a girl calling from New Orleans who wants to put up the winners of our little contest. 
[00:58:00]  Julie.  Yeah.  What's going on?  What's up?  You're a brave soul.  I certainly am, aren't I?  It says, we'll let Super Bowl winner stay with her.  Definitely.  What is your deal?  Well, you give away the Super Bowl tickets and I'll let somebody stay at my house for, I'll say, 300 bucks.  Come on.  All right.  250.  250.  Well, come on.  You got it. 
[00:58:30]  Well, look.  You got a figure.  You know, the hotels are going to cost, what, $500?  Does that include a Hummer?  No.  What do they get for their $300?  Yeah.  What do they get?  Well, they can come over.  They can drink.  I mean, I'll provide the alcohol.  Well, that could be a bonus right there.  Yeah, you think?  Alcohol, maybe a little meal.  Sure.  Most definitely.  I can make some good New Orleans food for them.  Some crawfish.  Definitely. 
[00:59:00]  Jambalaya.  Definitely.  And do they get to watch the shower or anything?  Most definitely.  I've got two bathrooms and they're all, they're good to go.  No, no, no.  You didn't hear me.  You obviously didn't hear me.  No, no.  What did you say?  Can they at least watch you shower?  Watch me shower?  Well, I don't know about all that, but they can take a shower.  Are you hot?  I hope so.  I think so.  I'm 5'2", 110 pounds.  Is that a truck backing up or you? 
[00:59:30]  No, that's me.  All right.  And my car door.  That's her.  That's her, she says.  I know.  She did, yeah.  She played right to it.  All right, Julie.  Julie, I don't know if anyone's going to go for it, but we'll put you on hold and we'll  get your phone number, okay?  All right.  That sounds good.  All right.  Do you live with anyone?  Yes, I do.  Who?  I have a husband.  Oh.  But he's cool.  No, he's cool.  He's good like that.  We'll pop our eye out.  Definitely. 
[01:00:00]  You could F her in the eye.  We're both from New York.  Can they watch you F or something?  They're going to need a little entertainment.  My new bride.  We'll drink some of that champagne.  You could F her in the eye with your pencil D.  I love that one.  One of my best favorite turkey boy ones.  Yeah, I don't know.  But you see, I mean, me and my husband, we're both from New York.  Yeah.  We've lived there all our lives.  All right, all right, all right.  I would pay the 300 bucks. 
[01:00:30]  I'd go in there and I swear to Christ, I'd burn your effing house down.  Because I couldn't get in trouble.  You couldn't get in trouble.  You weren't spending.  You would get $300.  I'd burn your goddamn house down.  I would say, I don't know.  I was smoking upstairs.  Sorry.  It's not a crime.  You're out of house.  All right, well, I got homeowners.  And you know something, the 300 bucks I paid you, burnt up too.  Huh?  Hey, I like Julie.  Relax.  I don't know.  She's coming across like someone who's just trying to capitalize on the Super Bowl being  in her town. 
[01:01:00]  I think it's a good deal.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  There's a guy from Boston that hopefully will win the Super Bowl tickets when we're up there  on Friday.  Chuck.  Yo.  Hey, go ahead, Chuck.  Yo, I got a Winnebago.  I would drive up there on Friday if I win.  She could take her 300 bucks, stick it up her crapper.  Oh, no.  Come on.  That's not nice.  I will drive up there Friday.  I got beer in the Winnebago.  It's going to be a blast.  John from Greenwich wants to know if it's a double wide for 300 bucks for a trailer park. 
[01:01:30]  I'm going to stay in a trailer park, trash, drinking beer for the Super Bowl.  Julie, what kind of house you got?  I got a big house.  I got a three-bedroom house.  I got a huge backyard.  You got any kids?  I even got a tent set up in the backyard.  All we could do is we could say, screw the contest, give the tickets to the Retard Laverne  Shirley and drive this lady absolutely insane.  Now, that's a very important question, though, Julie.  Do you have children in the house?  I do, but they're all right. 
[01:02:00]  They're all right.  How old are your kids?  I have three kids.  I have a 10-year-old, a 5-year-old, and a 6-month-old.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  And you would just let someone...  No, my husband will be there.  You need $300 that bad to take the chance?  No, I'm trying to help somebody out.  No, you're not.  You realize how much people could drink in Boston?  Are you insane?  You want drunk strangers in your house with your children.  Drunk strangers in your house with your children. 
[01:02:30]  You're an insane woman.  I've got a husband who's taking care of me.  He's not Superman.  He's not going to know who's diddling who.  My God.  All right, Julie.  Thanks for the offer, but I think we're going to pass.  All right.  There's too much going on.  Little kids crawling around.  Hey, I was trying to do something nice, you know, giving my...  For yourself.  No, not for myself.  Yes.  I'll tell you...  So, you know, somebody wants to get my tickets. 
[01:03:00]  Julie, you're not doing something nice.  You're doing something nice for yourself.  I'll tell you what nice is.  Where you give up your place for free to a fine listener from Boston and they get to  watch you shower.  Yeah.  And they get to drink all your alcohol.  That's doing something nice.  At least that's doing something nice.  Well, you know, if somebody wins those Super Bowl tickets and they don't got nowhere to  stay and my offer is still there, what do you think they're going to say?  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  Thank you, Julie.  Thank you. 
[01:03:30]  Okay.  I'm hanging up on Julie.  Jeez.  Stupid freaking people.  Stupid people.  All right, man.  I think contest is on.  It's obvious people will find their own way.  So you've got to find your own way.  You know, I think we should take a cue from Steve-O.  Yeah.  And do one of the most basic radio promotions ever.  What would you do for your tongue?  What would you do for Super Bowl tickets?  Is that it?  Yeah.  I mean, with the stuff we watch Steve-O do, I think some guys and ladies up there in  Boston could get pretty creative.  Okay.  Watch the Steve-O DVD and maybe come up with some ideas. 
[01:04:00]  Some ideas.  If someone could eat possum without puking, I would give you tickets too.  Steamed.  That's not a bad idea, actually.  That's disgusting.  We get the most disgusting thing.  Cook it up.  Have Frenchy cook it up.  Not in a good way.  Ew.  You, shut up.  Ew.  And we have a lottery.  I'm just going with this, Ann.  Have a lottery with all the people that want to win the Super Bowl tickets outside the studio. 
[01:04:30]  They pick the lottery to get in line.  First person that eats whatever this is without puking gets to go to the Super Bowl.  And then we've got to have a bunch of disgusting things for them to eat.  I think one disgusting thing.  Because what if they both do it?  Did you see the possum stew?  Yeah, but what if they both do it?  Then we're screwed.  What do you mean?  No, the first person to do it.  That's where the whole lottery thing comes in.  Placement very key to the contest.  Well, what if the first person eats it?  And doesn't puke.  And doesn't puke.  That's out of luck.  That's why Frenchie has to come up with something really good. 
[01:05:00]  No, he cooks too good.  That is just so vile.  We need the Jeffrey Dahmer cook.  Oh, God.  I think that guy's in jail, though.  He should be.  I haven't heard from him since.  He was no cook when we had him cooking rat.  All right, people are freaking for the Super Bowl tickets.  This guy, George, says he'll sleep anywhere for the tickets.  George?  Yeah.  Hey, bro.  What's up, bro?  Hey, man, this is the Super Bowl, bro.  We don't need to sleep at some slut's house for this.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  Like, seriously, if you guys want, I'll jog down there, man. 
[01:05:30]  You know what I'm saying?  All right, well, we're telling you flat out.  We got a pair of tickets.  That is all we have.  We don't have a way to get there, and we don't have a place for you to stay.  Bro, that's fine, man.  When you think about it, that's all you need, bro.  When you think about it, really.  All right.  All right?  All right, we'll figure it all out.  All right, you guys suck.  We might need another hour or two to figure this out.  Exactly how we're going to give them away.  Isn't that funny?  Someone on Instant Feedback has a bunch of numbers lined up that correspond to some of the contestants,  and he has all these numbers, you know, this plus this plus this plus this, about five numbers. 
[01:06:00]  Still doesn't equal ten.  Poked rat on our show.  It was supposed to be really disgusting.  He had a presentation.  It was rat au poivre.  It was cooked perfectly, and people were actually going, can I have more?  Yeah, people went back for seconds.  You don't have a disgusting food contest on the radio where people ask for seconds, Frenchy.  You ruined our whole bit that day.  Jeffrey Dahmer had a...  Thank God we had a second cook that just kind of just cooked the guts and everything.  He bashed the rat over the head, peeled the skin off, and then put the rat head in his mouth raw, 
[01:06:30]  and then fried it up in a frying pan.  It wasn't even cooked all the way through.  It was just deep fried fast.  Jamie rat.  Yeah.  So you want something really disgusting?  We want to come up with a dish that is so disgusting that most likely most people that eat it will not be able to keep it in their stomach.  Well, I can get something very good, actually.  What would be something disgusting?  Well, guts.  How about guts?  Guts? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, guts from any kind of animal.  And you could get this?  Probably so, yeah.  Like a...  Oh, you know, you like the fact that I had the lamb head when I cut it open, right?  I remember you...  You spoon out the brain out of it?  Yeah, spoon out lamb brains.  Oh, God, I'm just kidding.  Do you remember that?  I remember that, and no one puked.  Yeah.  Well, because you had a mole, and I liked the brain, so, you know, I can come up with something.  I remember we cut open a lamb skull, and they were eating the brain right out of the skull.  Yeah, but they do that anyway.  It's like an Italian belly.  And no one puked. 
[01:07:30]  Well, I can get something worse than that.  Just let me think about it.  All right, we've got to figure this out before we go to Boston.  Yes, Rick?  I still have Stalker Patty's toenails.  Oh, my God.  I think she's dead right now.  No puking required.  I can do something with that, too, actually.  You know what?  There's too much risk involved.  I think we might have to go with what would you do for the Super Bowl tickets, I'm thinking.  What do you think?  Why don't you let me think about it today?  I'll come up with an idea by the end of the show. 
[01:08:00]  All right, Frenchy.  All right, I'll call back.  Get in the coffee.  Thanks.  What, Ben?  I just hope that all you guys realize by doing this, one of you guys has to share a room with Frenchy then up there.  No, Frenchy is up and back in one day.  Frenchy goes up, cooks, and gets his ass back to New York.  Yeah.  All right?  All right.  Well, we'll give you gas money.  Apparently, on Fear Factor last night, they had them eat pig rectum.  Cut the butt out of a pig. 
[01:08:30]  All right, Frenchy.  All right, I'll call back.  Call.  Bye.  All right.  Let's go to Brett.  Brett, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, hey, what's up?  I've been on hold since before that bitch Julie came on and said that she wanted $300 for somebody to stay at her house.  Yeah, you're calling from New Orleans?  Yeah, I'm calling from New Orleans.  See, she's not from here, so she wouldn't know anything about Southern hospitality, but I am.  All right.  So we can put them up for free, man.  You would put them up for free?  Now, what's your story?  You're not a serial killer or anything.  Hell no. 
[01:09:00]  Got a crawl space under your house?  Dude, not on Super Bowl weekend, just on regular weekend.  Are you married?  You got roommates?  What's the deal with you?  No, it's just a friend of mine has an apartment, and I just figured that we could put them up.  You know, I heard y'all's dilemma.  Figured we'd call up and help.  See?  Now, there you go.  I mean, true Southern hospitality.  Nothing in it for us, just hospitality.  Now, that's doing something nice.  There you go.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We'll get your info.  All right, Brett?  All right, man. 
[01:09:30]  All right, peace.  All right, we'll figure out how we're going to give away the Super Bowl tickets.  I think it ought to be something maybe if a girl, someone's girlfriend, wants their guy to go,  maybe her and the guy to go to the Super Bowl.  How about the guy brings her down for a one-day-only wiffle ball bat challenge?  Something like that.  Maybe if that's an odd thing.  I think, I don't know, we've got to do something special.  Yeah, something a little, I don't know.  Maybe we'll open up to the listeners.  How should we give away these Super Bowl tickets? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  We're not digging any of our ideas yet.  No.  Okay, Marco, what does he want?  Marco.  Hey.  Hey.  When are you going to get to the effing El Camino story?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oh, Gay Kandahar?  I've been waiting forever to hear it.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  All right, we'll get to it.  We've got to get to it either next or very soon.  Hey. 
[01:10:30]  We still have to do the top 20 American albums of all time today as well.  Oh, come on.  All right, hang in there.  When we start talking about it, though, call us because we want to get your opinion.  I love Palestinian men.  On your knees.  My pleasure.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  All right, Marco.  Okay, bye.  Call's back.  Oh.  No, let's, uh...  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Steve-O doing that shot of tequila yesterday? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, we can play that again.  By the way, all these clips from Steve-O are up on foundrymusic.com.  There's a link to foundrymusic.com through opandantony.com.  Good luck downloading something.  Why?  I've been on this for hours trying to download one clip.  Well, because there's...  It is, let me check, 46% done.  I started downloading at 3.05.  Because everyone's slamming it.  You've got to go off hours, my friend.  Off hours.  When we mention the website, it's not a good time to go to it.  Yeah.  We're just doing that so you can write it down for later. 
[01:11:30]  Well, that's good.  Eating eyes from a ram's head.  Get it?  Sheep ram thing.  Ram meat tie-in thing.  Ram.  Eh, whatever.  We can work off the word ram in many different ways.  Ram that somewhere.  All right.  We'll figure something out.  Yeah.  Okay.  Steve-O decided to do a shot of tequila in a very strange way.  Yes, he did.  I don't know if he explains it here, but basically he snorted the salt. 
[01:12:00]  Drank the tequila.  Probably the equivalent of four shots of tequila.  And then decided to pour the lime juice from a half a lime directly into his eyes.  Into his eye.  Zep.  Oh, no.  Now, get your shot ready.  No.  You're going to snort the salt?  No.  Stop it.  I think he's going to go.  Rather than a little wedge, I'm going to go with the full half.  A half a lime you have there. 
[01:12:30]  He's got the tequila, the salt, and the lime, but I think he's going to do it a little differently  than you and I.  Okay.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, the tequila stuntman.  Oh, he just snorted the salt.  Oh, my God.  He's chugging the tequila.  A little chug of the tequila.  All right.  He's taking off his glasses.  Get out of here.  I've got to be squeezing.  The lime in the lime juice.  He squeezed so much lime juice into his eyeballs. 
[01:13:00]  Dude, get out of here, man.  Now, you find me a bartender that won't give me a beer for that.  You can't even open his eyes.  Plus.  Plus.  He's got lime juice right in his eyes.  Imagine my pleasure when I go back over to that girl and say, hey, remember I said I  was going to go tell that bartender he's going to give me a free shot of tequila and give  me a beer for drinking it.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach. 
[01:13:30]  You guys make me blow chunks.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a couple of ass wipes.  And he's done.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Man, we're thinking.  We're thinking around here.  We're trying to figure out how to give away Super Bowl tickets.  Oh, yeah.  We want to come up with something very unique, something very different. 
[01:14:00]  We don't have it yet.  We're throwing some ideas around.  We'll get it.  We got it until Friday.  Maybe our listeners can help us with this one.  We're going to be in Boston Friday.  And one lucky listener will walk away with a pair of tickets to the Super Bowl.  We want to involve a lot of people.  We want to give a lot of people a chance to win the tickets.  We know that much.  We have one idea we're throwing by the gang up there.  Yeah, we're going to approach them with an idea and see how it pans out. 
[01:14:30]  I will guarantee they say no.  We'll see.  I would love to do the bee in the jar contest.  Yeah.  We're throwing more tickets.  But maybe we can talk to the lawyers and see if they're willing to crack on that front.  God, that would rock.  The bee in the jar contest, man.  It's our greatest idea ever.  That we've never been able to do.  We haven't been able to do it yet.  Shake them up.  Get them all angry.  Guy's got to put his junk in a jar. 
[01:15:00]  With one bee.  One bee in a jar.  Bunch of guys lined up.  And then the first person that gets stung on their junk by the bee.  Gets the Super Bowl tickets.  Gets the ticks.  But the lawyers have a problem with that.  Cruelty to bees or something.  I don't know what it is.  The bee lawyers fighting it out.  Yeah.  A whole frightening little guy.  All right, we'll figure it out.  Ooh. 
[01:15:30]  The idea that we're throwing by the gang up in Boston.  We'll get the whole city in a frenzy.  Oh, yeah.  The whole city in a frenzy.  And people will get arrested.  I believe it could be bigger than Mayor's Dad in Boston.  Shh.  You don't think so?  Bite your tongue.  It could be.  No one's going to beat that one.  Stop.  Only we could.  Stop.  Could be.  All right.  And why don't we get into the top 20? 
[01:16:00]  This is ridiculous.  American albums of all time.  It's actually a top 100 list, but we don't want to spend that much time on this.  Another stupid list.  Another stupid list.  This time around, it's Blender Magazine.  There's a couple problems.  I guess their research department isn't that smart because Neil Young's on the list, and  he's from Canada.  Yeah.  Cananida.  He's from Canada.  Cananida.  He's Cananida.  And someone help me out.  Isn't Joni Mitchell from Cananida, too?  Yeah, I think she is.  There's two.  Well, it's the top 20 American albums. 
[01:16:30]  American albums.  And the whole thing is stupid.  I just need Ben in here because he's going to help us with the tunes.  We just did one of the top, what, bands?  Yeah, the top bands.  Right.  Of all time.  And I see some of those bands represented in the top American albums, and I'm still,  like, flabbergasted.  Although, I don't see Egypt 80, Africa 70, whatever it was. 
[01:17:00]  We forgot.  What was that, Earl?  Falakuti.  Falakuti.  Falakuti.  Falakuti.  Falakuti.  Where's Ben?  Oh.  Hey, we don't have the first one?  Oh, that's over there?  Is it A or B today?  B.  Oh, it sounds like B.  Listen.  B.  Yeah, that's making the B sound.  No, this is making the B sound.  That's the B sound.  All right, all right.  So, top 20 American albums of all time, Anthony. 
[01:17:30]  We'll start with number 20.  Uh-huh.  Hit, hit.  Here it is.  Uh-huh.  Where is it, Earl?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Is it buffers?  Buffers.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey.  What?  Hey.  Made.  I can't get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Yes, your favorite criminal.  I can't get it.  Get it. 
[01:18:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Come on, man.  Baby.  Yeah, number 20, Anthony.  James Brown.  James Brown, Sex Machine.  Sex Machine.  Top 20 American albums of all time from 1970.  Your peeps representing.  Yeah.  There's a lot of representation on this list.  Oh, of course.  Let's count black people versus white people.  All right.  How many do they make up?  There's one, two, three, four. 
[01:18:30]  Ah, well, three and a half.  Five.  No, four or five.  Six.  Six.  Seven.  Seven.  He's so black, he should count twice.  I'm just kidding.  Eight out of the 20, right?  Eight out of 20?  All right.  Let's go right to number 19, Ed.  Uh-huh.  Top 20 American albums of all time.  American.  Yeah.  Not Canadian.  And here it is. 
[01:19:00]  Canadian.  Neil Young, Russ Never Sleeps, 1979.  I was never a big Neil Young fan.  Loved Neil Young growing up.  But okay.  19.  I'd give it to him.  What the hell?  Throw him a bone.  But he's not American.  He's the father of grunge, Ed.  Ah. 
[01:19:30]  Oh.  And when he plays with any grunge band, he always looked like their father, didn't he?  He's playing with Eddie Vedder and stuff.  Where is Eddie Vedder in Pearl Jam these days?  Any news?  Anything?  New album?  They're heading the, like, yeah, they're doing really well.  Oh, really?  They haven't stopped touring.  They've gone a little underground, and their fans appreciate that.  All right.  That's kind of cool.  James, what's going on?  Yeah, you guys did Phila Cootie.  I don't think you know what you're talking about. 
[01:20:00]  We played some Phila Cootie on our show.  Yeah, you guys.  And we're not going to lie.  We didn't get it.  You don't think that should be up there?  I don't get that.  That was another way.  You don't get it?  It's like FUBU clothes.  It's not for me.  If it wasn't for Phila Cootie, though, you wouldn't have so much of this other music you've got nowadays.  Yes, very influential.  Shut up.  I mean, extremely.  Who was influenced by?  And he's from America.  Who was influenced by Phila Cootie?  Who was influenced by Phila Cootie?  Anybody today.  I don't know if you guys are really into the R&B scene. 
[01:20:30]  Thank you.  That sounded like the whitest guy, too.  He's one of those guys.  Man, you guys kill me.  Not so much him if he's into the Phila Cootie, but I see some wiggers walking around that just like, it's like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  You look as ridiculous as Urkel looks, being a nerdy black guy, being the ghetto white guy.  You see the white kids wearing FUBU shirts and stuff?  Yeah.  Doesn't that mean for us, by us, Earl? 
[01:21:00]  Earl, correct me.  Yes.  For us, by us.  Who is us?  Just the guys from the neighborhood.  No.  For us, by us.  What is the code word?  What does us really mean?  It doesn't mean anything.  It just seems like it's being made by a regular guy.  The ooh in FUBU is black people.  It's for black people by black people.  And for Whitey to wear it, it looks silly.  It just looks silly.  I can't wear the FUBU?  No.  Anybody can wear the FUBU. 
[01:21:30]  For us, by us.  Us means you.  Don't use those references, Rick.  I know what you said.  Those are only to be used in certain motion pictures about Somalian helicopters down in.  Skinnies on the roof.  Skinnies on the roof.  Do you hear that?  That's what they call them in Somalia.  We got skinnies on the roof.  Somalians.  Isn't that insane?  Someone's trying to explain to us that Canadians are on the list because Canada is in North America. 
[01:22:00]  It doesn't say North American albums.  It says right on the cover.  American.  It's got a picture of Kid Rock holding a guitar with an American flag painted on it.  Not a Canadian flag.  From Canada.  All right.  A big hi to everyone in Toronto listening to us today, by the way.  They love us in Toronto.  Hey, we love you little bastards up there in Canada.  In Canada.  Your whole tundra up there.  All right.  Three quarters of your country being wasted under ice. 
[01:22:30]  Jesus.  Number 17, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, this band made it again to another list.  This is something I just don't care.  Top 20 American albums of all time according to Blender Magazine.  Mm-hmm.  The Velvet Underground.  Another case of the writers having to be too cool for the room.  Dude, you've got to put the Velvet Underground on the list.  From 1967.  The Velvet Underground and Nico.  I don't get it.  I'd rather listen to Fetakuti. 
[01:23:00]  Africa 80.  All right.  Enough of that.  Okay.  Was it Africa 80?  Earl.  70.  70.  Africa 70, Egypt 80.  That was the score.  Well, that's what it was.  Okay.  That's the final score.

Let me hear what I'm talking about.  He loves adding syllables.

FUBU is owned by two Jewish guys from Brooklyn.  Screw it.  Jack.  Would you stop, Jack?  Jack.  It's true.  No, it isn't.  It is not.  I work on the insurance, and I can't say who I am. 
[01:25:00]  Huh?  But it's...  Do you know anybody that runs a textile company that's not Jewish?  But it really is.  That's why it was so groundbreaking.  Shut up, douchebag.  It's a great marketing.  It's not two Jewish guys.  Yeah, and look at Rhino Clothing.  Same deal.  Swear to God.  All right.  Thank you, Jack.  Please.  For us, by us.  Black guys.  Here we go.

[01:26:00]  Hey, a question.  Big album from 1980.  I'm trying to find out what number falls on the list.  The Christopher Cross album.  Christopher Cross.  He was great.  With my favorite Sailing and Ride Like the Wind featuring Michael McDonald.  He was good for about four months, I think, right?  Something like that.  And then MTV killed his fat ass.  All right, Steve.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye.  My teenage.  He was listening to me.  Okay, moving on.  Top 20 American albums of all time in 13th place. 
[01:26:30]  Beating out...  Wow.  Beating out Thriller?  You know, I was...  I was wondering, you know...  You could chop my nose off.  To keep them?  Because the force has got a lot of power.  It makes me feel like...  It makes me feel like...  Michael Jackson.  Off the...  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!

Top 20 American albums of all time in 12th place.  In my opinion, this should have been a lot higher.  Metallica!  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  The Black Album.  A lot of the hardcore Metallica fans are not agreeing.  Of course.  The earlier stuff is the real Metallica.

You listeners rock.  I got so many emails, and I am just saying hello, and we heard you on the Opie and Anthony  show, and I heard the guy earlier saying, the girls in New York are not coming down.  How come?  I don't know.  Girls, come down.  Well, that ought to do it.  Hey, Rick, Amy's ready for her shoot.  There you go, Rick.  All right. 
[01:32:00]  Thank you, Amy.  Rick goes out, and...  Andy, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Andy.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  All right.  We'll unlock your lottery clip for you.  Okay.  I'm reading today about a guy, 32 years old, who goes to a strip club for his bachelor party.  And, unfortunately, one of the dancers decided to play, I'm Too Sexy, and, unfortunately,  she had 72 double Ds and suffocated the guy and killed him at his bachelor party. 
[01:32:30]  This is a true story, by the way.  Now, is this a case of unlucky lottery, or it sucks to be you?  I think this is sucks to be you.  I think this is more sucks to be you.  Well, you know what?  It definitely...  It's either going to help him out in the long run by not getting married, or it definitely  does suck to be him.  Yeah, he is...  He's judge.  He's judge.  Yeah.  You know what?  I think I know the distinction between unlucky lottery and sucks to be you. 
[01:33:00]  All right?  Yeah.  Unlucky lottery is the odds of such a thing happening to you have to be astronomical.  You could pass by the situation a million times, and it will never happen, like the rock  perched on the cliff.  You could drive past it.  A million people have, but it decides to fall on you.  What are the chances you're going to get suffocated by a stripper?  But, no, no.  The stripper, put in the same circumstance of somebody's head being held in a stripper's 
[01:33:30]  boobs until they suffocate, anyone can do that.  You could suffocate a man in a woman's boobs.  It doesn't have to be unlucky.  It's not like, you know, it's something that happens all the time, but kind of gets passed  by.  I believe this is Sucks to be You.  Sucks to be You?  Yeah.  Sucks to be You.  We got beat up by boobs once.  Yes, we did, and it sucked to be us.  We got to find those clips.  What the hell was her name?  The chick from Boston.  Oh, crap. 
[01:34:00]  Busty Heart.  Busty Heart.  Busty Heart.  She had huge boobs.  Disgusting.  They felt like they were full of cement.  Well, they were old school, the silicone.  Yeah.  And she got them a long time ago, so they were rock hard.  They had, like, scar tissue around them, so they were like a rock, yeah.  So she did tricks with them.  She would put things under them and hold them up.  Then she decides she's going to come over and hit me on the head with one. 
[01:34:30]  She goes, put on...  Did she have me put something on my head?  No.  You wouldn't do that.  That's right.  I wouldn't have done that.  No.  She comes over and smacks me in the head with her boob.  She pretty much said, put your hands up.  I'm going to fight you.  I end up on the floor.  She dazed you.  And I'm not there ever.  She dazed you.  She did.  No joke.  You backed up.  And then I sprained my wrist.  She had another trick where she crushes a Coke can.  You put it on the console.  Hold on to it. 
[01:35:00]  She takes her boob and grabs it like if it was a sock full of cement.  She grabs it right by her body and swings the bulbous end of it like a hammer and crushes the can.  Right.  She tells Opie to hold the can.  Well, she needed someone to hold it in place.  Yeah.  So Opie's holding it.  She misses, hits his wrist, and almost breaks his wrist with that disgusting big ick.  She was a nice lady, though, Busty Hart.  She's still doing her thing somewhere.  Pretty disgusting.  She had to hide because she had one of these lawsuits where she was doing her boob tricks. 
[01:35:30]  Well, that's why I thought something was on the head because she had some guy put a football helmet on.  Right.  At some club.  And she gave a guy a concussion with her boob.  And she hit him on the head and gave him a concussion.  So she went into hiding, no joke.  Because she couldn't afford the lawsuit.  Uh-huh.  So, yeah, here's a story.  Groomed killed by stripper's boobs, Geneva.  A fun-filled bachelor party at a strip club turned deadly when a 32-year-old groom-to-be,  who was enjoying the attentions of a well-endowed stripper, suffocated while his face was buried in her breasts. 
[01:36:00]  The mind-boggling drama unfolded, says cops, while Daniel Green was attending his bachelor party at the Pretty Kitty Strip Club.  The Pretty Kitty.  The Pretty Kitty.  Apple Hall.  The club has been rented out for the private affair.  According to investigators, Green was enjoying a lap dance.  Yeah.  When a disaster struck, one of the strippers, Candy Kane.  Candy Kane, any relation to Sandy Kane?  Sandy and Candy Kane?  Is this Sandy's long-lost sister? 
[01:36:30]  That's funny.  Candy Kane.  Candy Kane got too into her performance and suffocated the man between her 72 double-D breasts.  Wow.  Witnesses said that Green had his fair share of beer, of course, but didn't seem out of control.  When the song I'm Too Sexy began to play, I'm too sexy for my shirt, Green became excited and began to dance on the tabletop, hooting and hollering, pal said. 
[01:37:00]  He said, like an idiot.  Like stinky.  Hooting.  There's a quote.  He started hooting and hollering, like an idiot.  Like an idiot.  Miss Kane, apparently pleased to see someone enjoying her choice in music, moved in closer.  When Green took his seat, she began giving him a lap dance, shaking her breasts in his face.  The more she shook, the deeper Green got lost in her cleavage.  Danielle was having so much fun, we all thought he loved being in the gal's chest. 
[01:37:30]  Of course.  Of course.  Who could have known that when he was waving his hands around, he was signaling for help.  They probably thought he was still trying to dance.  Just being killed to I'm Too Sexy is just the worst thing.  Ever.  I'm too sexy for...  Ho!  Cheering on, lookers eventually realized that Green was no longer moving. 
[01:38:00]  And pulled him from between Miss Kane's breasts.  Now Green's family is suing Miss Kane and the Pretty Kitty for wrongful death.  Green's father, George, won't specify the amount they are suing for, but claims that it isn't about the money.  Those breasts were lethal weapons, he told reporters.  Oh, stop it.  The Pretty Kitty should not have allowed Miss Kane to have her bust enhanced the size that she did.  We hope that by filing this lawsuit, we can send a message to other strippers. 
[01:38:30]  Keep your bra size within a reasonable range.  Candy Kane made a statement through her attorneys.  She recited the ABCs.  Anthony?  No.  I thought he liked it in the pretty...  I thought he liked it in the what?  The story just ends.  Candy Kane made a statement through her attorneys.  I thought he liked it in the what?  In the what?  Oh, it's in there.  I thought he liked it in there.  Oh, in there.  The R.E.'s cut off on your story?  It just says, yeah, in the... 
[01:39:00]  In the...  The Pretty Kitty declined comment.  I don't know.  I'm not...  I'm not completely believing that story now.  Why?  Because what father is going to, after he loses his son, going to say,  those boobs are lethal weapons?  No one's going to say that.  It said AP.  Ah.  I'm thinking this is like, in retrospect, lighting the match was a bad idea.  It said AP.  It's got to be real.  You know the...  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  It's real, then.  Yeah, that sucks to be you.  All right.  Rommel's saying that it would be unlucky lottery if they were A-cups.  Because the odds that he would be suffocated by A-cups.  Well, there you go.  In that case, you could, like, lose an eye.  That's about it, right?  Yeah.  Uh, John, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, she's a stripper down here by Buffalo.  Uh, what, Busty Hart?  Yeah.  There's probably a bunch of them.  It's like a franchise.  Hey, she's nasty.  Well, she's an old-timer now. 
[01:40:00]  Maybe she gave me a black eye once.  Oh, sure she did.  Like, it's like radio jock names.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  They just whore them out all over the place.  Sniff, did you see her on the main show?  Uh, no, I did not.  We saw her in person a few years back, so...  Man, I don't know about them things.  Do you know how many Chesty Morgans there are?  You ever hear of Chesty Morgan?  Sure.  Up, uh, upstate New York?  Sure.  She had the big boobs.  Vinny!  Yo, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Uh, if they win that lawsuit, they should pay him in singles.

[01:46:00]  He liked it on the tabletop, right?  Yeah, he liked to be under the table, I believe.  Earl, did he like it on the tabletop, or did he like it right on him?  No, I think he was filming the girls as they were doing that, right?  Yeah, that lawsuit's still pending.  Oh, it is.  Oh, filming girls in the ladies' room of his club.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay, as we move on with the list, top 20 American albums of all time.  Yes.  This is number seven, I believe.  Number seven. 
[01:46:30]  Ah, there you go.  Blondie.  Parallel Lines.  Nice piece.  Have a day.  Hello, all.  Ah.  All right, guys.  I've got nothing to say about her, except, boy, she really aged badly.  What, Blondie?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was like all thin and stuff.  She puffed up.

Oh, this is a biggie, man.  A lot of people bought this album growing up.  Ah, yes.  Who put the jam on the pussycat's tail?  Who put the grease on the banister rail?  Who put cement in the scrubbing up pail?

Our own Buddy Epson, Anthony, making the list.  Buddy Epson.  All right, obviously, that was a joke.  Let's move on.  In fifth place, Anthony.  Yes, number three. 
[01:48:30]  Top American albums of all time.  Fifth place.  I thought we were up to three, I would hope.  It's a bitchin' daddy kitchen.  Is it?  I'm trying to run through the list quicker.  Oh, okay.  Joe.  Number one.  All right, we'll go through it.  Number five, here it is.  Appetite for Destruction, Guns N' Roses, 1987.

I'm from Cleveland, and I want to know what a Cleveland steamer is. 
[01:50:00]  You don't know what a Cleveland...  I hear...  We didn't make it very obvious for you?  You know what?  No, I just caught it.  I caught the tail end of you saying Cleveland steamer.  And I've heard that reference so many times, I have no idea what it is.  Well, that's...  That's where a guy...  It's also called the hot lunch, Marianne.  You know what a hot lunch is?  Absolutely not.  Hot Carl?  The hot Carl?  Nope.  The Chicago hot plate?  No.  Nope.  Never heard of it.  There's many names for it, but it basically... 
[01:50:30]  It's number two...  Oh, good.  ...on you.  That's the Cleveland steamer.  See, Marianne, you would lay down on your back, right?  Yeah.  And the person you're with would dump number two on your face.  You've got to be kidding.  I thought it was something good.  Oh, it's very good.  I'm sure.  It depends who you talk to.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I can't believe you've never heard of that before. 
[01:51:00]  I've heard the reference 9,000 times, but just never knew what it was.  Yeah, there you go.  There it is.  All right.  All right.  Hey.  I'm glad we can educate.  It's a good...  There goes Marianne.  Jim, what's going on?  Hi, is this Casey?  Casey, I'm sure I'd like to make a goddamn death dedication today.  Look, how am I supposed to come out of a goddamn up-tempo number into a goddamn dog dying?  You guys suck today.  Where are those pictures I was supposed to...  You go, guys.  Hi, Jim.  We're queuing up number two, Anthony, because people need to know. 
[01:51:30]  They need to know.  Can't we just stop it right now?  I've never seen that done before.  And just leave them hanging?  You don't even bother finishing.  All right.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Sounds good to me.  All right.  Screw it.  Who cares?  Try to figure out number two and number one on your own.  Who cares what it is?  Gay Kandahar.  Yes.  We talk about it next. 
[01:52:00]  Dazzle Opie and Anthony with your brilliance now.  In New York, call 877-692-1027.  Nationally, 866-277-4-WOW.  Opie and Anthony.  A little stanky.  Rick is doing a reshoot with Amy, the hot wife.  He brought in some great, great, great Naughty 90s. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  Her new pictures will be up on opandathony.com.  Let's go to Washington real fast.  Jason, what's going on?  Oh, and hey.  What is going on, my brother?  Hey, man.  I got a Naughty 90 contestant here in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  This would be the second girl from Washington, D.C.,  joining the contest.  Yeah, all the other cities need to just punk out right now  because I think we got this thing won.  Oh, really?  A little cocky there, are you?  I'm telling you, she's hot.  I just sent a little teaser pic to Ben. 
[01:53:00]  She's going to go through the pics and pick some that she likes.  But she's here if you want to talk to her for a sec.  Well, let me just ask you this, Jason.  How many pictures did you take of the girl?  About 95,000.  She must be good.  You know what?  I don't want to give away one of Rick's secrets,  but if he's only snapping two,  well, you can finish that statement yourself.  Yeah, you go.  I've seen Rick take between some girls 100 and some two. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  A front and a back with no variations.  I just figured it's her trip to Jamaica,  so, you know, let her pick what she wants.  That way she can't be mad at me.  Yeah, we keep forgetting to tell people that we got a trip to Hedonism 3.  Why does DeVita have a second page, by the way?  What?  What's wrong here?  Why?  Turn around.  Which one was DeVita?  Oh, DeVita.  We liked DeVita at the time.  That was early on in the contest.  We're excited. 
[01:54:00]  Two pages.  Two pages for DeVita.  I don't get it.  Two pictures for others.  You know what?  So, Jason, she's how?  What does she look like?  Oh, my God.  Yeah?  She's really tall.  Yeah?  Maybe almost six feet.  Wow.  And she's got long, straight red hair, gorgeous complexion, brown eyes,  and a body that, which is, I mean, she's like an Amazon, but she is so hot.  Wow.  Seriously.  She's just got, I mean, she's got the junk in the trunk. 
[01:54:30]  Uh-oh.  She's got it up top.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, she is hot, man.  Junk in the trunk, though?  Is she an African princess?  No, she's not.  No, she's a white woman.  She's a Caucasian last.  Hey, Jason.  Yeah?  I understand you're relatively new to the program,  but do you realize what junk in the trunk means?  Yeah.  Well, it means something different around here.  It just means that she doesn't have a flat ass.  I mean, she's like, you know, she's got a nice ass, but, you know. 
[01:55:00]  Is it a little junky?  Is it a little big?  No.  No, it's proportionate.  All right, that would be junk in the trunk, though.  Now he's using the trunk.  All right, well, my bad.  I've got to get up with the lingo.  I better go to the website and check myself.  There you go.  Now, you're cool.  Thanks for helping us out, Jason.  There you go.  Second girl from Washington, D.C., joining the Naughty Night of Contents.  Yeah.  OpieandAnthony.com.  Have all the contestants.  And, yes, we have an all-inclusive trip for two to Hedonism 3.  Hedonism 3 Super Clubs, the Caribbean's only super-inclusive resorts.  Playfully wicked and devoted to pleasure has a way of life. 
[01:55:30]  Call 800-GO-SUPER.  Devoted to pleasure.  Suck it.  Suck it.  And still no one representing from Boston.  We're going to have to go up there ourselves to get it done, I guess.  Kick some ass.  We'll be broadcasting live from Boston Friday.  A gay old Afghan time again, Anthony.  Gay old time.  A story we couldn't get to yesterday because of Steve-O.  And it's a great little story.  Who knew this was going on, man?  Well, Anthony, it turns out Kandahar is coming out of the closet now that the historically gay city... 
[01:56:00]  Historically gay city.  Historically gay city.  Who knew?  Who knew we were freeing gays?  Free the gays.  Isn't it great?  We can free the gays.  See gays?  Free health.  That don't ask, don't tell stuff.  It looks like a wreck.  It's in the hole.  The military's helping you out.  The freedom. 
[01:56:30]  And save you, Paul.  How great is that?  All right, I can't listen to too much of that.  I was getting into the ABBA.  Yeah.  Makes me want to go see Mamma Mia live on Broadway.  What are you, gay faggot?  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the H, fellas.  Looking up for a place to go.  All right, I can't.  Stop.  Use it or lose it. 
[01:57:00]  Find another gay song, man.  Get I'm Too Sexy or something.  That was pretty gay.  Yeah, ABBA's pretty gay.  I don't think it gets much gayer than the ABBA, right?  Oh, Rick's going to try to find more gay than ABBA.  All right, so Kandahar is coming out of the closet now that the historically gay city in southern Afghanistan has been liberated.  When I think of places being liberated, though, from the Taliban rule,  I was thinking, you know, the liberation of the concentration camps, which is a huge thing back in the 40s. 
[01:57:30]  Because, I don't know, you liberate homosexuality and they just start effing in the streets again?  It gets worse.  Is that what they're...  It gets way worse than that.  Gay Marco.  Hey.  Hey.  Howdy.  What's up?  Just saying howdy.  I love ABBA.  Obviously.  What do you think of Kandahar being a gay city there?  I never knew.  I don't even know where the hell it is.  Now you're going to find out, though, aren't you? 
[01:58:00]  Definitely.  He'll be at the pizza place in Kandahar.  You'll be re-taught.  I can't catch someone.  Hey.  You go to the pizza parlor after the bar.  After the...  We learned from you.  After you don't find anyone in the gay bars, you wait outside the pizza parlor.  In Provincetown.  In Provincetown.  You can wait out there because that's where all the people go that weren't able to hook up with the guys.  And that's kind of...  You don't like having to end up at the pizza parlor, though, do you?  No.  Here he is at the pizza parlor.  You get to...  Hey.  Hey. 
[01:58:30]  Hey.  Doesn't sound happy.  Hey.  All right, Marco.  We'll go to you here.  Hold on a sec.  Listen closely, though, all right?  Here, Marco will help us out with gay Kandahar.  The Osama bin Laden allied regime banned homosexuality, Anthony, along with other no-nos like TV razors and kites.  No watching TV, no shaving, no flying kites, and no...  And no sea sucking.  No anal.  Right.  And kites when it took over the country in 1994. 
[01:59:00]  But now that the Taliban has been sent packing, men are once again appearing in public...  Thank God.  Here it comes, guys.  With their Ashna.  Ashna.  Ashna, or beloveds.  Yes, my Ashna.  Oh, dear.  Bring that Ashna over here, dear boy.  Their Ashna, or beloveds, which translates to young boys they have cultivated for sex.  Young boys.  Oh. 
[01:59:30]  Ah.  Yes.  Bring out the Ashna.  I'm going to F the Ashna.  I'm going to F you in the Ashna.  Wow, this is a gay song.  But is it gayer than ABBA?  This is very much gayer than ABBA.  This is gayer than ABBA.  Yeah.  ABBA at least had a couple of girls in it.  I know this is going to be made into a promo, but I think we could get even gayer than this. 
[02:00:00]  Stop it.  No.  Gayer than...  Culture Club.  Boy George.  Well, yeah.  All right.  All right.  Young boys, they cultivate for sex.  They're Ashna.  Ashna.  Young boys, they have cultivated for sex in Canada.  Oh, ho.  Ashna.  Oh, ho.  I'd love it in the Ashna.  Oh, ho, ho.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Hey, you like that, don't you faggot? 
[02:00:30]  What is that one from?  Is that kids and all?  No, that's, uh, what do you call it?  Where's that from, man?  That one kills me every time.  Oh, what's that show on HBO?  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  Queer as folk?  No, no, no.  It's the show from HBO with the funeral home.  Oh, oh, Six Feet Under.  God, it just sounds like sweaty gay men's sex.  Rick, are we attempting to get gayer than Culture Club now or no?  Uh, no.  Good luck.  All right.  Young boys.  Yeah, Mike's got a good one on line three that could be gayer than Culture Club. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, definitely.  All right.  Oh, hell yeah.  If you can find that one.  That's really gay.  Before the show's over, we will find the gayest song.  Okay.  Okay.  So, it's, uh, the Ashna or Beloveds.  Yes.  Young boys they have cultivated for sex.  Uh, Times of London correspondent Tim Reed reports that Kandahar's, uh, uh, uh, what's  that word?  Pashtuns?  Have been known for, uh, practicing homosexuality and particularly with young boys for centuries, 
[02:01:30]  Anthony.  Yes.  For centuries.  Before the Taliban took over, uh, Reed reports the streets were filled with teenagers and  their sugar daddies flaunting their relationship.  Dr. Smith, get out of that man's Ashna.  That is not your Ashna.  That Ashna belongs to another man.  Such a cute little Ashna.  I'm going to spank it all over that nice, smooth, firm Ashna. 
[02:02:00]  Woo!  Oh, dear.  Shut up.  Leave me alone to my Ashna.  I love effing in the Ashna.  William was my Ashna.  Yes.  The Taliban outlawed it, but I'm back.  Woo!  Effing in the Ashna.  Oh, dear.  Delicious little Ashna tastes like a little dirty penny.  No penny, get away, penny. 
[02:02:30]  You're a girl.  Yes, Wesley.  And don't even show me that whore, Judy.  With her bosom and vag.  Yuck.  Young William, that's my Ashna.  Woo!  All right, J. Marco.  I'm booking a flight tomorrow.  Yeah, I'm sure you are.  Just fly there on your twinkle toes.  Young virgin boy.  Ah, pretty gay.  You know what?  I don't think this is gayer than Culture Club, though. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, yeah.  Very close.  Hey, J. Marco, you're the expert.  Very close.  Are you ready?  Wait, is this song gayer than Culture Club?  No.  Yeah, I didn't think so.  I'll give you a gay song.  All right, go ahead, gay Marco.  Supermodel.  What?  By RuPaul.  Oh.  You gotta work?  Yes.  Work it.  Work it, girl.  Whack.  Eh.  Is that, that's gayer than Culture Club?  Oh, yes.  What about I'm Too Sexy, though?  Oh, no, that's not gay. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  That's gay in a dance way.  We need just gay.  Just, uh, over-the-top gayness.  All right, can we continue with gay, uh, gay, uh, Ken Harant?  Ho-ho.  All right, uh, so they have this obsession for young men.  Uh, locals tell you that birds fly over the city using only one wing, the other covering their posterior. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, even the birds don't want to get it in the keystep.  The locals told this reporter from, uh, the Times of London that birds fly over the city, I gotta repeat this, using only one wing, the other covering their posterior.  Right.  Oh.  Ho-ho.  This is pretty gay.  Yeah, that's pretty gay, too.  That's, that's, that's up there.  Okay, uh, Reed reports that the rape of young males by local warlords.  Warlords. 
[02:04:30]  Was a key, uh, factor in Mullah Omar, uh, mobilizing the Taliban.  In the summer of 1994, a few months before the Taliban took control of the city, two warlords confronted each other over a boy.  In the ensuing battle, civilians were killed.  Omar's group freed the youth and was soon swamped for help, uh, in settling disputes.  All right, thank you, gay man.  They took over the whole city because of a gay dispute.  Because of, uh, gays.  That's how the Taliban, uh, got to power.  By helping out the, by, uh. 
[02:05:00]  Beating up the gays.  No, but it was because of the gay thing.  Yeah, the gay thing was going on and the Taliban came into power because they were beating up gays.  Yeah.  They were kicking out the gay.  Oh, two warlords confronted each other over a gay.  Civilians were killed.  Omar's group freed the youth.  Right, so he wouldn't be sucked into this world of homosexuality.  It was the warlords that were nailing the kid.  Right, the warlords nailing the kid.  Two warlords were nailing the kid and the, and, and, and they saved the kid. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  It's having a discussion.  From war abuse.  That's a hot story, isn't it?  Well, let's ask gay Marco that's hot.  Marco, hot story?  Oh, so romantic.  Romantic.  So, would you like to have two warlords, uh, fighting over your, uh, Ashna?  Oh, please, I've had it many times.  Did you say, just say romantic?  Romantic.  Romantic.  Romantic.  Right.  Okay, that's what I thought I heard you say.  Okay.  Romantic.  Would Marco be the warlord or the gay boy? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, what would you be like?  Marco as the gay boy.  Marco would definitely be the Ashna.  Who would be the two warlords fighting over you?  Uh, Harry Rollins and J.C. from NSYNC.  Ah, come on, Rollins and F.U. Bolt at the same time, like a spewer.  Oh, my God, it's so exciting.  You'd be skewered.  All right, hold on.  We got someone that's, uh, from Afghanistan, and they're gonna explain that, uh, Afghan gay  is not the same as American gay.  Oh!  Uh, what?  Wow, what do they put it in different? 
[02:06:30]  No-gee.  No-gee?  No-gee?  What's your name?  No-gee.  No-gee?  Yes, yes, sorry, I'm sorry.  Oh, you're a chick.  Yes, I am.  What is your name?  Najee.  Najee.  Najee.  Hello, Najee.  Hello.  It's Haji with an N.  Najee, like Najee, but Najee.  Okay, Najee, you're from Afghanistan.  Didn't Jeannie have a sister named Najee?  Isn't that the guy in the bottle?  It was her helper. 
[02:07:00]  Hey, Najee.  Yeah.  How long ago did you get here to this fine country?  Oh, how long ago?  Like, ten years?  Ten years.  Yeah.  And you still talk like that.  Nice.  Yeah.  What do you do for a living there, Najee?  I'm a realtor.  Do you wear the wacky clothes like you used to?  When you're driving in your realtor's car, taking people from house to house?  Yeah, actually, right now I'm in my beautiful party.  Yeah, that I am, but I don't have any people.  I just wanted to give you some info about, like, gays in Afghanistan. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  Okay.  They are really, so, they're very, like, we have a very strict culture, so women and men,  like, it's not like, you can't have a boyfriend in Afghanistan, even now.  No?  You can't be like, hi.  So, guys are attracted to each other.  In gay relationships in Afghanistan, the boy doesn't have a choice.  He has to be, like, more feminine looking.  He should look like a girl.  Because the guys can't be with girls?  How does that country make little scumbags? 
[02:08:00]  Hello?  Hi, Najee.  I just like saying that.  I'm getting disconnected.  I'm getting disconnected.  I have to call back.  Najee.  Hold on, Najee.  We are here, Najee.  Najee.  Najee.  Najee.  Hi, we're still here.  Yeah, I know.  Don't leave us, Najee.  Okay, I won't.  Okay.  So, they really get the boys that look like girls.  They have, like, white skin.  And once they grow older and they have beard and mustache, they let them go. 
[02:08:30]  Ah.  So, wait a minute.  They're not allowed to have girlfriends, though?  Najee, so, I kind of get her.  So, they go up to the young boys because they look like girls.  More feminine.  Right.  So, that's not gay, right?  What about the...  You can't say, what about the CEO?  I can't hear you guys.  I have to call you back.  Hold on.  Najee.  My little Najee.  Najee. 
[02:09:00]  Najee.  Najee.  Najee.  Yeah.  All right, listen, really fast.  Okay, so they go...  I can't hear you guys.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They go after the young boys because they look like girls, right?  Okay.  What about the...  What about the junk?  I can't hear you guys.  I have to call you back.  Najee.  Hello, Najee.  Aw, there goes Najee.  What kind of...  She's using an Afghani cell phone.  Najee.  She better call back.  Hey, um... 
[02:09:30]  That was the most obscure thing I've heard.  You said my little Najee.  That's great.  I love the little Najee.  You hear her?  So what Najee was saying is, yeah, the young boys are used in lieu of girls because men  and women don't hang out in Afghanistan.  If you want to make little animals, what you do is you get married and you have your sex  and you have children.  But if you're just a guy and you want sex, you can't hang out with the chicks. 
[02:10:00]  So you grab another guy, one that's young, that looks like a chick, and you have sex  with that boy until they get older and grow a beard and abuse another young boy.  Sorry, it's not gay because you're not allowed to date women.  Sounds good to me.  Well, the young boys look like women, so it's close enough.  Yeah.  I think Najee was saying that she was thankful that they pick up on little boys because it  keeps those animals off of her. 
[02:10:30]  Off of Najee.  There you go.  Yeah, imagine that.  The women probably aren't.  Well, no, they get time to beat them in between raping young boys, I'm sure.  What a country.  We got a member of the Taliban talking to one of these young boys.  All right, let's listen.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  Hey!  Really?  Virgin.  No, no, no.  Pucker up and kiss my ass!  Yeah.  All right, Paul, what's up? 
[02:11:00]  Hey, guys, check it out.  Hey.  I served overseas in the U.S. Army.  I was working in Macedonia, and we had a whole bunch of international armies there and stuff.  Yeah.  And we had a few Muslim countries represented.  One of them was Indonesia.  And they had a famous saying, because homosexuality is so prevalent in the Muslim world, but it's  like unspoken up.  They had a saying, though, that they would tell us, and it was, women are for babies and men are for fun.  And they live by this, man.  That's Norton's motto.  They're such pussies, man. 
[02:11:30]  All right, Paul, thank you.  And, hey, I got a question, though.  That Steve-O thing yesterday, when will that be on E?  Very funny, Paul.  That was supposed to get us Paul, I guess?  That's very good, Paul.  You're still listening, though, aren't you?  Yes, he is.  All right, Anthony, so what have we learned so far from gay Kandahar?  Well, we've learned that the bearded men like the clean, hairless boys.  They like the Ashna?  The Ashna.  Okay.  They like it in the Ashna.  All right.  And the whole reason why the Taliban started ruling was because of a gay dispute. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, a little gay dispute.  Warlords trying to rape some young boy.  There we go.  All right.  Now we move on.  By November 1994, Omar and his Taliban were Kandahar's new rulers.  Despite the regime's hatred of women and penchant for eyeliner, homosexuality was banned.  Men accused of being gay were executed by having a wall toppled on them.  Yeah.  Who invented that?  They are animals. 
[02:12:30]  Animals.  They would bury you slightly next to the walls and push it over on you with a tank.  They have that many walls?  Yeah, I know.  Well, they don't care about any.  They're animals.  That's what it is.  There must have been a lot of gay men in that city because have you seen pictures of that city?  There's no walls left.  No walls left.  They push them over.  That's smart.  In recent weeks, reports read this reporter from the Times of London.  There are signs the Ashna are returning, Anthony. 
[02:13:00]  And thank God.  A common sight is that of a heavily bearded man seated next to or walking with a clean-shaven, fresh-faced boy.  Fresh-faced.  Fresh-faced.  Fresh-faced.  Fresh-faced is even reflected in Pashtun poetry, odes written to the beauty and complexion of an Ashna.  It is practiced at all levels of society over there.  But for the poorer men, having an Ashna can raise his status.  Don't ask me why I'm remembering this or something. 
[02:13:30]  It comes out of nowhere.  It's weird.  Opie, when are you taking the little kid to the hockey game?  My own personal Ashna?  Oh, gee, I didn't even realize that.  It just popped in my head.  You're going to take your little fresh-faced Ashna to the hockey game?  Well, I'm going to the island game tonight, Anthony.  11-year-old, now 12-year-old Ashna Gary.  Now, remember.  Remember.  I'm looking for a weekend game with a sub-500 team.  Both of these things do not apply tonight because we're playing the Devils. 
[02:14:00]  Also, you know, I want to take him to a game where we can enjoy all three periods.  Tonight, I will, you know, I get there in time for the second because of traffic and stuff.  So no Ashna?  No, my own little Ashna.  Too many witnesses with an above-500 team.  My little Ashna will have to wait for his island again.  But it would raise your status in society.  What is status Afghani for mule?  Yeah, raise your status.  When a man sees a boy he likes, the age they like is 15 or 16, they will approach him in 
[02:14:30]  the street and start talking to him.  Don't they get in the hair by then, though?  Offering him tea, Anthony.  Tea.  Sometimes they go looking in the football stadium or in the cinema.  The cinema.  Or football, which, of course, is soccer.  Don't be silly.  It's not really football.  Right.  He then starts to give presents.  Hashis.  Hashis?  Or a watch, a ring, or even a motorbike.  Whatever else they lose in the Ashna. 
[02:15:00]  One of the most valued presents is a fighting pigeon.  A fighting pigeon?  These boys are nearly always innocent.  But such is the poverty here.  They cannot refuse.  Ah, you know, they're open to negotiation when it comes to getting a fighting pigeon.  Three, get this, this is coming from 98, 1998.  Three Afghan men convicted by an Islamic court for sodomy with young boys survived an attempt  to execute them. 
[02:15:30]  There has been some debate among Afghani's Islamic scholars as to whether it's more appropriate  to execute those who commit the great sin of homosexuality by throwing them down from  a high roof or hill.  That's one choice.  Or burying them beside a wall which is then toppled on top of them.  The latter method was used this week.  And the guy survived.  He was taken to the hospital because you get a reprieve by the law of the Quran. 
[02:16:00]  So they pushed the wall down on him.  The guy lived.  Despite, and this is when they were amputating limbs.  They would also amputate the junk of homosexual men in the stadium.  In front of everyone?  In front of everybody.  They would cut off your junk.  I think we got our idea for the Super Bowl tickets.  Ah.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, I was saying, how effed up has Kandahar got to be that women cover their faces but 
[02:16:30]  men walk around with little boys?  I mean, is this Michael Jackson's Mecca or what?  Yeah, I don't think it gets any worse than that, huh?  Boy, why didn't Michael Jackson just move there?  Yep.  Well, hey, I got to roll.  Martin sucks.  All right.  And Amy, real fast, you're on O.P. and Anthony.  What's up?  Yeah, my husband is in the military.  And they went to Saudi Arabia a couple of years ago.  And they were, these guys, telling them that women are unclean and only worthy of giving  birth, but men are strictly for pleasure. 
[02:17:00]  Ah.  Yeah, a lot of people calling in with that today.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  That is strange.  And now that I think about it, you know, you take a cab in this city and it's an Afghani  guy and you say, how much for the ride?  And he goes, just f*** my f***.  And I'm like, well, that doesn't really, you know, it says like 540 on the machine.  He goes, no, just put your f*** in my f*** hole. 
[02:17:30]  They say, hey, it's 550.  Give me a tip.  He goes, yeah, the tip of my f*** in your f***.  Okay, Marco.  Marco.  You're enjoying this story or what?  It was so hot.  I'm going to wait a happy hour now.  I'm going to see if I can get myself a fighting pigeon.  Where are you going to happy hour there, Marco?  Flash bar.  Oh, is that it?  All right.  Back that Ashna up. 
[02:18:00]  Thank God you said where, Ben.  Gay Marco mentions a place in the village where he's going for happy hour.  And Ben goes, where?  I thought Ben knew every place.  He's going to go, oh, yeah, that place is right down on, oh, I have no idea.  Yeah, they've got good chicken wings.  Yeah.  Thank you, Marco.  All right, Marco.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I'm here live in Kandahar.  I'm doing an in-depth investigative report on homosexuality. 
[02:18:30]  Homosexual.  Homosexual.  This isn't my speech impediment getting in the way.  It's my young Ashna and his junk in my mouth.  Homosexual.  Thank you, Ashna.  I am here doing an expose on homosexuality in Kandahar.  And I've come here with fighting pigeons galore. 
[02:19:00]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I'd like to see Dan Rather get in the hole for ratings.  I'm boosting my ratings here in Kandahar.  I see all the pigeons around you, sir.  I believe tonight I'll be heading to the cinema with a pocket full of fighting pigeons and a zipper full of fighting...  I see you got some hash over there, too, huh?  Yes, hashish.  Hashish. 
[02:19:30]  Hashish will get you a hot young Ashna.  You smoke it up with them.  I put it in the bong.  What do they call that here?  A hookah.  I put it in the hookah.  And before you know it, I'm f***ing my Ashna right in the hole.  Come on, Rather.  I'm throwing up the challenge.  I'm throwing it out there, the challenge for Dan Rather.  Dan, come here.  I will shave closely so I am like a fresh-faced boy and be your f***ing Ashna. 
[02:20:00]  We can team up.  Both networks win.  No one loses.  But wait a minute.  I have to get f***ed in the f***ing hole.  Look at that over there.  I'm looking at Geraldo Rivera and his little Ashna.  What about the birds flying over the city with just one wing? 
[02:20:30]  One wing holding over their posterior.  It's true.  Because everyone loves to f*** in the f***ing hole.  The young Ashna loved me because I actually use a little bit of oil.  Because most men here, they are not very sensitive to these young boys' needs.  And they cannot sit for many days after getting f***ed in the f***ing hole. 
[02:21:00]  Be careful, though.  You don't want a wall toppled over you.  No, no.  Although, if it boosts ratings, push the wall on me.  I don't care.  Hey, I'm a boy f***er.  I'm a boy f***er.  I don't care.  Push the wall on me.  I love Kandahar.  It's raining men.  Howl, howl, howl, howl.  Thank God, it's raining men.  Howl, howl. 
[02:21:30]  John Brooke, a lie from Kandahar.  NBC Nightly News.  F***hole.  Najee's not calling back.  Najee!  Najee!  Guys, you're making fun.  Hello, Najee!  Guys, don't make fun.  I don't appreciate it.  Oh, well, okay, Najee, sorry.  Sorry.  Okay, because I'm trying to give you some facts, and you guys are making fun.  That is silly.  That is silly, Najee, I know.  Okay.  We apologize, Najee.  That's okay, thank you. 
[02:22:00]  Now, what is the deal?  How do they then make little Afghanis if they can't hang out with girls and they have sex with boys?  Okay, this is how it works.  Like, if you're gay, then you're gay.  You're not going to go after a woman.  They are not, like, we do have gay in Afghanistan.  I'm not saying that.  We have actual gays.  But these people, they get to keep a boy for a while, and then they get married, and they have children and everything.  They have a wife.  But they don't show up. 
[02:22:30]  So the joke's on us because they're not gay.  They're actually straight.  Oh, okay.  They're straight guys.  That explains the 70 virgins.  Yes, Najee.  They will hang out with guys afterwards, too.  They don't stop.  Even when they get married?  Yeah.  But they're not gay.  No, I don't know.  We do have gays.  We do.  We do have a lot of gays.  But you're saying, Najee, you're saying every guy does this.  Not every guy.  Kandahar does.  Kandahar is a non-city farm.  Kandahar is like Frisco, right?  I don't know about that. 
[02:23:00]  So do they suck it or what?  No.  See, I can't talk like that.  Oh, right.  Opie, stop it.  Najee does not talk like that.  Are the boys used, are the boys used, do they do things to the man or does the man do things to the boy?  Man will do things to the boy.  Ah.  That's why they don't have a choice.  They are being used.  All right, Najee, Najee, with that, so what makes you gay, then?  No, I'm not saying you're gay.  In our country, you suck one. 
[02:23:30]  You're gay.  You're gay.  Who's gay?  No, so you're saying, what distinguishes the gay men over there from the men who are just having sex with men?  And how do you say crinkle crinkle in Afghanistan?  Listen, I don't know what that means because I'm really, I don't understand the language.  But see, if you're gay, you're like gay in America.  What I'm trying to really say is the way gays are in America.  We're gay in America today.  Yay!  Yeah?  Najee, yes. 
[02:24:00]  So, they will marry a gay guy.  They will marry a guy, right?  Over there, they will marry a woman.  They would.  Najee, you are from probably the most effed country on the face of this globe.  I couldn't agree with you more.  I know.  Your homeland of Afghanistan is full of animals that will just have sex with whatever moves  and then be hypocritical enough to claim some kind of morality. 
[02:24:30]  It's disgusting.  You can't generalize.  It's not all Afghanistan.  No, it is the entire country of Afghanistan.  See, I like you guys.  You're fighting with me now.  Hey, Najee.  Oh, I'm sorry, Najee.  Najee, do you know some of that Afghani talk there?  Do I know some of them?  Yeah, talk sexy in Afghanistan.  Can you give us a little something in that Afghani language?  Not too many clicks.  Oh, what do you want to hear?  Like, ask for a nice word.  Okay.  I want, how do you translate the word crinkle?  I don't know what crinkle means.  It's the sound that a bag makes, a paper bag, when you crumple it. 
[02:25:00]  It goes crinkle, crinkle.  It's like this, Najee.  I don't know.  No?  They don't have a sound for that.  So, I'm very conservative, so do excuse me.  Najee, Najee.  I got another one for you, Najee.  Uh-huh.  No, you can't say that even here on the airwaves in English, Opie.  Najee?  Yeah?  Hi.  How would you say, Najee, how would you say, um, I want you to make love to me? 
[02:25:30]  Oh, um, I want you to make love to me.  Let me see.  They don't know love in that freaking country.  Oh, trust me.  You really don't say it honestly.  How?  Oh, they don't say that at all?  Of course not.  No, you can't.  Then how do you say, I want you to have sex with me?  They're too busy raping little boys.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  What's a good come on line to a little boy?  Let me hear it.  I'm not a guy, so I wouldn't know.  Yeah, but what would they say in Afghanistan?  Give me a little something here, Najee.  Uh, how about hi?  They're going to say it in their language, okay?  Okay, go ahead.  They're going to say, like, they're going to say, that means you look, um, gorgeous. 
[02:26:00]  What is it?  Kulikari.  At least you look really nice.  Kulikari.  That sounds like you're spitting something out after the act.  Kulikari.  Actually, that's the Pashto language, so that's how they would say it.  Yeah.  I mean, that's like a, they're very, like, they are not very, I mean, I'm not going to  say that.  They're not very modern.  I'm sure their approach is very basic, so I really can't take too much information on  that side.  Me need schlong, like is the little rule translation. 
[02:26:30]  I don't know.  All right, let's let Najee go.  Okay, thank you, guys.  All right, Najee.  Thank you, Najee.  Bye.  Bye.  There goes Najee.  Can we try to get the gayness out of this show, please?  You think when she came over here, she'd pick, like, Barbara or something?  Mary.  She's got to go around being a Najee.  Hey, Christy.  Yeah.  How you doing?  I'm good.  Wow.  There's an American.  Christy.  Yeah.  Huh?  No Najee there.  No, no Najee.  You know anything about homosexuality in Afghanistan? 
[02:27:00]  No.  Thank God.  Back to basics, Opie.  All right.  Christy, why are you calling the show today?  My boyfriend has wanted me to do this.  It's got queef forever.  Oh, the 6 o'clock queef.  But it's 6.15.  That's okay.  I've been on a whole night.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles, make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor. 
[02:27:30]  Flex up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  All right, Christy, are you ready?  I'm ready.  All right, let's hear it.  Okay.  Did you hear it?  Yeah!  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Bravo.  Blow out the candles, make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef. 
[02:28:00]  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor.  Flex up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  All right, very good.  That feature back in the show.  That was good.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  I can't wait until we just do a whole montage one day of all the queefs we've heard.  That's a great idea.  Just string them together.  Then we could maybe put them in a sampler and make jingle bells out of it on Christmas  like they do with the dogs.  That's a great idea.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:28:30]  Or you could just make a soundboard.  Yeah.  And then you can make your own tunes.  Queef tunes.  All right, let's take a break.  Mike DiNicola's here.  Hey.  With Pete Correale.  Speaking of young hairless boys, Mike DiNicola.  We'll talk to them next.  Then why don't we see what's going on on the F.U. line today.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the O.P.  Anthony F.U. line.  This F.U.  goes off to Pittsburgh.  And all you Steelers fans across the country and all the sports announcers that doubted  that the New England Patriots would beat the number one defense in the league. 
[02:29:00]  Well, guess who's going to New Orleans next week?  Hey, F.U.  Next message.  Hey, this is a big F.U.  To all you Pittsburgh fans out there who printed up the Super Bowl shirts before you lost a game.  Here's a big F.U.  You can drink the New England clam chowder out of my mule.  F.U.  You, Pittsburgh.  Next message.  This F.U.  goes out to Cordell Stewart, you whiny little bitch.  The best team doesn't win?  F.U.  And the best quarterback doesn't throw three interceptions, you ugly, whiny bitch. 
[02:29:30]  Now go clean out your locker and go home because your season's over.  You suck.  Next message.  Say a big F.U.  To all you Eagles fans out there, you guys suck.  You've never won a Super Bowl.  You never will win a Super Bowl.  You guys are horrible.  You always will be.  F.U.  Philly.  You suck.  End of message.  Dirty.  Dirty.  Dirty.  Dirty.  Dirty.  Can I see your taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice. 
[02:30:00]  Between the peach and the blue knot.  Can we see your butt?  Nice.  I would have to just blank on your chin.  Does this guy know how to party or what?  Okay, terrific.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  In the studio.  We just made them wait like an hour and a half outside.  Not on purpose.  No, no.  There are some people we make wait.  We just forgot about you.  It's Mike DiNicola and Pete Correale.  Yeah, man.  Yes.  What's up, guys? 
[02:30:30]  Two good friends of the show.  They're playing Caroline's tomorrow night, I believe.  That's right.  9.30.  Well, we gave you something good to look at.  You got to check out the hot wife getting her photos for the Naughty Nighty contest redone, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah, it was entertaining.  Watching the husband stand there enjoying himself.  I couldn't imagine that, though, man.  Isn't that a little odd?  It's insane.  Yeah.  I mean, he's just saying, oh, yeah, you know, that's my wife's bisexual and, you know, want a cup of coffee?  It's literally that casual.  Yeah.  And you want to look, but I keep waiting for him to sneak up behind you with a brick. 
[02:31:00]  You're like, hey, what are you doing?  Looking at my chick.  Yeah.  He doesn't care.  He's not even looking.  She's kind of nude on the couch.  That chick makes him a lot of money.  Oh, yeah.  The red thing?  Yeah.  She wrapped her legs around it, kind of.  Yeah, but you did first, Rick.  Yeah, you did first.  He even showed her how to make a face.  No way.  He goes, get on and go.  He always does that.  He put his hands over his chest and just stuck his tongue out.  He's a true leader because he will not tell somebody to do something he isn't willing to do first.  Exactly. 
[02:31:30]  And I respect that in you, Rick.  Fresh-faced Rick looking much like an Ashna.  Ashna, Rick.  Fighting pigeons.  I got fighting pigeons.  Hey, yeah.  You read about Gay Kandahar there, Pete?  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  The Afghanis like it in the Ashna.  The Ashna.  Get a couple dirty street birds, teach them how to fight.  It's a fighting pigeon.  It's a really expensive one.  Come on.  I put a lot of money into this. 
[02:32:00]  Unzip.  The best line of that whole story, the city is so gay that the birds fly over the city with one wing because the other wing is covering their life.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  I like Gay Marco coming on, saying I'm going to try out and get a fighting pigeon for myself.  That's, like, going to be a new saying around New York City.  You got a fighting pigeon, man?  I got two fighting pigeons last night.  Pigeons.  Hmm.  Used to be gerbils.  Now it's fighting pigeons seem to be the animal choice.  It looks like Lynch is going to have a new song.  Well, it's about time.  Go, fighting pigeon, go. 
[02:32:30]  Take the fighting pigeon down to the old pub instead.  There are so many.  You know something?  Don't play with daddy.  Go throw it to daddy.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Watch.  You say it.  I'll give it to you hard.  What?  What did you just say?  Christina?  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're talking to your kid?  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  I thought she was being all hot.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  No.  You tell it to daddy.  She's throwing her little bouncy ball at me.  Oh.  You guys, listen.  I got a question and a comment. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  You guys had the Afghani on the line.  Najee?  Najee.  You guys should have asked her to do the six o'clock quiz to see what an Afghani lady sounds like.  Oh, like a camel spitting.  Want to hear that?  Why not?  What?  It sounded like the tunnel that Omar's hiding in.  It sounds like this.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  It sounded exactly like, uh, uh, Zenith War Cry.  It sounded like it was a baby.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's that.  It got a lot of saliva going on there in that.  And the one who called the dude a queef? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  It sounded like she was just blowing in on the phone instead of...  No.  No, hers was good.  No, mine was good.  I called in last week.  No.  I was from Philly.  Remember, you guys said you were going to be in Philly?  I'll tell you, man.  This syndication has brought out the competitive spirit in everybody.  Yeah.  My queef was better than hers.  No, I'm not a gay person.  No, I'm not a gay person.  I can't think of a queef, huh?  All right.  Why don't we go with this?  Christina, why was your queef better than today?  All right.  What's that?  Why was your queef better?  Because hers sounded like she just put the phone to her mouth and blew in the phone.  And what did yours sound like? 
[02:34:00]  I don't...  I don't...  Well, I'm not going to do it right now.  I can't because my daughter's in the room.  Did it sound like this?  Now she's got morals.  No.  Yeah, that's good.  That's a nice queef.  No.  That's nice.  Mine sounded like a little rumble.  Yeah, well, that's a little...  Joe, you want a picture?  Hey, you know what?  You should have a contest.  I've never rated queefs before in my life, ever.  I think one's as good as the next, you know what I mean?  We might have to sit around and rate queefs one day.  Exactly.  Do a contest. 
[02:34:30]  Who does the best queef?  You might be on to something there, Christina.  All right.  Why don't you go take care of your kid?  What's that?  Why don't you go take care of your kid?  Hold on.  My husband's home with me.  All right.  Hold on.  Then Tom wants to say hi to you.  I was doing it in a polite way.  Uh, Tom?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, listen.  Hey, hooker.  Why don't you go take care of that kid of yours and stop acting like a disgusting swat?  Excuse me?  You're a pig.  You're a pig.  What?  You're a pig.  Go throw the ball back to your kid and then go throw yourself out a window, you pig.  Excuse me?  Where are you calling from?  You're a swat. 
[02:35:00]  Rubbed.  Or...  Frenchie.  Is it Frenchie?  This is my gig.  What are you doing?  Yeah, if I'm a swat and whore, okay, whatever.  Hey, Christina, I didn't say that.  No, where is he calling from?  Uh, probably New York.  That sounds like a New York guy.  Okay, I'm a swat and whore.  But I'm sure the same thing would come out of someone from Cleveland today.  Yeah.  Are you going to drive down and beat him up?  No, I'm a full-time mom and I work full-time.  You're a full-time whore, you bitch rag.  Why don't you shut up? 
[02:35:30]  Go play with your kid, you hooker.  Christina?  Yeah?  Do you hear him?  Oh, yeah, it doesn't bother me.  I'm not going to get all upset.  Because I know it's not true, so, oh well.  You know it's not true, you whore.  Go ahead.  Go throw the ball to your kid after you go diddle yourself.  Getting all the deep, nice language.  Nice language, you hooker.  That's right, I'm a hooker.  That's right, I'm a hooker.  Dude, come back.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want to apologize for that caller. 
[02:36:00]  Christina, how could you say that type of stuff in front of your kid?  We're dumping out like crazy.  No, no, no, I'm in another room.  Oh, we can hear the kid.  Oh, it sounds like it.  I want to apologize for that last caller, Christina.  That's awful.  Eh, whatever.  People like that are a bunch of low life.  They have to call in and call a female hooker.  Shut up, slut.  Why don't you suck it?  Is that what you call your mom?  Suck it.  Is that your mom?  Is that what you call your mom, a hooker and a slut?  Yes.  Yeah, as a matter of fact.  When she calls up and argues over the authenticity of a queef, then, yeah, I tend to think that 
[02:36:30]  from time to time.  She's like, that girl's a loser.  Listen to you.  That queef sucked.  I mean, this hasn't been a classless conversation since the word go here.  Mine had a rumble.  You whore.  Isn't it true that your kid just threw a rope ladder down and climbed out?  Oh, yes, it is.  So worn and weathered?  That's awful.  Repelled down like a soldier?  Anthony, don't you think that's awful? 
[02:37:00]  That's terrible, man.  Why don't you hang up, you idiot?  Yeah, Christina, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Christina.  No, that's cool.  I understand.  Doesn't bother me one bit.  Where are you calling from, Christina?  From Philly.  Yeah, we see.  We need all the listeners we can get from Philly.  This idiot is really pissing off.  Yeah, Christina's from Philly.  Here he is again.  Philly's herself up with as much C as she can.  All right, all right, all right.  Listen, listen, listen.  Stop.  Did Philly get the idea for cream cheese by you pulling down your panties?  I got Flamanda cheese from Down Under.  Do you want to come and sniff it? 
[02:37:30]  You disgusting mess.  All right, hold on.  Anthony, that guy, we've got to hang up.  Hey, hey, knock it off.  That's awful.  Jackass.  Oh, my God.  I got Flamanda cheese from Down Under.  Does he want to come and sniff it?  Yeah, what's your answer to that, smartass?  Hey, he doesn't have one.  Now he's all scared.  Oh, no, I put him on hold, Anthony.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, yeah.  Here he is.  Dude, what do you have to say about that?  I'd rather be a smartass than have a stank ass like Christina, you slut. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, that's so weird.  Are you over a cleave?  Oh, my God.  I'm going to go cry to my mom.  I'm a slut.  Yeah, go cry, you bitch.  Oh, wait a second.  Hold up.  You slut.  No, no, no, no.  This ain't another car calling in.  My husband just said it's Anthony messing with me.  What?  I am not taking that.  My husband just walked in the kitchen and said, hold up.  That's Anthony trying to mess with you.  You know, Christina, you're too quick for us.  I got to tell you.  It's not Anthony.  I swear to you, you bitch. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, now the girl that is, the other girl's pissed off.  Christina, today's queefer is calling up Christina.  What's that?  Christy.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hi.  Wait, all right, hold on.  There's a Christy and a Christina.  So, Christina, I was talking to Christy, so shut your mouth, okay?  Whatever.  When I say Christina, that's when you say hi.  Wait.  We're talking to Christy now.  Hi, Christy.  Hi.  Dude, she's talking about my queef wasn't up to par with hers.  Yeah.  What, because mine doesn't rumble because I'm loose?  What the hell? 
[02:39:00]  Wow.  You know?  You pop another kid out, why don't you?  I sure will.  God.  God.  Christy, do you have any children?  Huh?  Do you have any children, Christy?  I have one.  What?  That doesn't make me...  Wow.  One's okay.  One when I was 17.  I'm 23 now.  I'll be a 17, you little slut.  We're talking to Christy and Christina, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's funny how amazing those names are like Caroline's, which is where Pete and I will be 
[02:39:30]  tomorrow.  Oh, wow.  When's that?  You've learned from the foot of the master.  Norton.  Smooth.  All right, Doug.  Wow.  Christy and Christina.  Yeah.  Why don't we have a queef off?  We are going to have a queef off.  Oh, yeah.  Right now.  Oh, right now.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Christina, go find another room.  All right.  Christina?  What's that?  Are you going to have a queef off with Christy or what?  Find a room.  We've got to have a queef...  All right.  And how would you know?  Are you here looking at me?  All right, listen.  You're the one talking about it on the air. 
[02:40:00]  Find a room that doesn't have a kid in it.  You're a gangster.  Yeah, I'm a gangster.  Okay.  She's like the typical...  I'm a gangster.  Housewife.  All right, Christina, get another one.  I was a hooker who had my child at 17.  I ain't a hooker, honey.  I'm a nursing center from CSU.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  No, no, no.  Don't hang up.  Christy?  I'm not hanging up.  Uh-uh.  Queef off.  Queef off.  Queef off.  Christina?  Yeah, I'm here.  Are you ready for the queef off?  Sure am.  She can go first. 
[02:40:30]  This is better than the pre.  Think she's all big and shot?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  We got...  Wait a minute.  I think the, um...  You know, like, little queen of queef to go first to show me what I'm up against.  This is worse than my pre-five press conferences.  Wish you people.  All right, hold on.  We're going to take a break and we'll have the queef off next, okay?  Stay there, ladies.  Hold on the line, girls.  Get ready and get the kids out of the room there, Christina.  No, we're going to have a queef off.  Why don't we even try to show our intelligence on this show when it's that easy, man? 
[02:41:00]  All right, uh, queef off next.  Pete Correale, Mike DiNicola in the studio.  Pete, you're going to have to come back, and Mike, of course, when we have more time.  Absolutely.  All right, but we'll be back with the queef off, and maybe what do we learn on the opening  show today?  You know what we do here?  Absolutely nothing.  That's wonderful, isn't it?  You'll be an Anthony show.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  In the studio, Mike DiNicola, Pete Correale.  Don't have much time for him today, unfortunately. 
[02:41:30]  Two very funny guys playing Carolines tomorrow.  They'll come back, though.  Well, come on, guys, a queef off.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, I'm happy to be here for that alone, man.  You can't argue when it comes to a queef off.  Absolutely not.  A big queef off.  Who needs the Super Bowl?  That always wins.  We have queef.  And you can tell all your friends that you got bumped for a queef off.  Yeah, right?  We are moving and shaking in this room.  Wait, let them get that.  They're going to get that one.  That's one context we're not allowed to put that in. 
[02:42:00]  There you go.  Is that one.  Yeah.  We all know what it is, Pete.  You'll learn, though.  Hey, Christina.  Yeah.  Hey.  All right, you ready for this?  Sure.  All right, hold on.  Is your husband blowing air up there?  Getting ready.  No, my husband doesn't blow up air.  No, no.  My husband's a real guy.  All right, let's all stop with the explaining.  Yeah, everyone knows the deal.  Everyone knows.  Can I just tell you real quick?  What?  You guys rock.  All right, Christina.  Seriously.  No, I had to tell you that. 
[02:42:30]  I didn't like you guys in the beginning, but now I love you guys.  Yeah, no one does.  Well, we love you.  Thanks.  Hey, Christy.  Yeah.  All right, you're ready, too?  I'm ready.  Can we get the kid out of the scene?  I thought we weren't doing this.  We are doing this.  You just told me you didn't have time.  You just wanted me to battle it out with her.  No, we have time.  No, we're doing the queef off.  All right.  What Stinky was supposed to tell you was that we don't have much time, so we've got to get  right to it.  Oh.  So get rid of your kid, and let's go.  All right.  People want to hear the queef off. 
[02:43:00]  Well, she can stay in a room.  It's okay.  It's not like she's never seen me before.  Oh, God.  Oh, my goodness.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Who wants to...  Should we flip a coin for the...  No, I'll go, because I'm not the Stinky who calls and complains.  Oh.  All right.  Who was that?  Christina?  Yes.  You were the one that complained.  Thank you.  Because you were...  No, I wasn't the Stinky.  Well, you know, look.  We don't have time.  I'm going to hear a queef with a baby background.  All right.  Listen.  Christina, you were the one that said... 
[02:43:30]  Special circle of heaven.  You were bragging about your queef from last week, and you said that Christy sucked today.  I did.  All right.  So, why don't you let her go?  Okay.  All right.  Let's...  What the shit?  Everyone's got to be quiet.  Wait.  Who's going?  Me?  You.  Krista.  Christina.  Christina.  Give me one quick second.  Seriously.  All right.  You ready?  Ready.  Be quiet.  Hold on.  One second.  Here it goes.  Awful. 
[02:44:00]  Wow.  All right.  Yeah, that's going to be a tough one to beat.  That's Christina.  Kristy.  Yeah.  You think you can beat that?  I don't think it's going to be that lengthy, but it'll be a lot louder.  Oh, all right.  That's good.  Here it goes.  You have to put your arm under your pit.  Okay, ready?  Here it goes.  Kristy.  Shh.  Shh.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Oh, please.  Come on.  That was with your boyfriend blowing in on the phone again.  No, it wasn't.  Whatever.  Okay.  Whatever.  All right, Kristy. 
[02:44:30]  Why don't you try to match that?  All right.  Who was that?  That was not me.  Wait.  Who was that?  That was me, Kristy.  That was Kristy?  Kristy.  Who was that?  No, that was me doing that on the phone.  That was just her blowing on the phone.  No, it doesn't.  No, Kristy's kicking your ass.  We can tell the difference between blowing in the phone and the real deal.  No.  All right, Kristy.  You're not a woman.  You don't know what it really sounds.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it, girls.  Hold on, ladies.  Hold on.  They're yelling and screaming.  We dumped out about five times there. 
[02:45:00]  Girls take time.  I'm from Cleveland.  I'm from gangsta.  What are you going around?  Showing your cleavage?  You skank?  Oh, yeah.  I'm a skank.  That's why I'm at home waiting all my, like, five days.  Are you married?  Huh?  Are you married?  Do you know what it's like to live?  No, you probably don't.  Because you're probably a mommy dad to kiss your ass.  Oh, hey.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Well, I'm out of dump here.  Hold on.  We're out of dump, ladies.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They're screaming.  I think we should get some chloroform for these two.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Chloroform.  Yes. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  We had to pot them down because we ran out of delay.  Joe, why don't you give your plug as we get them back up here?  Yeah.  No, we're going to be at Bar 9 tonight.  Tonight.  Bar 9, right?  Yeah, down on 9th Avenue.  And one other thing, I'd like to thank the guys down at Comac Guitar Center.  That would be John Manphy, Rob Jack, and Brian Gabriel for taking care of me.  And Mark Johnson over at TC Electronics.  All right.  Those guys rule, man.  They rock.  They've been doing a really good job.  They give Joe the equipment for the song parodies.  Thank you. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Very good.  Let me see if these girls are still yelling at each other.  Christy and Christina.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  Girl, you can't curse, man.  I can't wait to hear this back when Rick gets a hold of it and takes out all the stuff.  Well, who's the winner?  Well, why don't we try one last time?  We only got like two minutes left for the show.  Now, you know what?  What?  I'm going to pass on it because I better say things to do with my life when I'm like skank  on the other line.  That's why you call.  At this point.  What did you say?  Now she's on the line. 
[02:46:30]  You're on 15 minutes doing this, honey.  All of a sudden, now you got some way to go.  Come on.  That's why she called it in the first place.  Did the crack dealer show up?  What happened?  She called it in the first place.  Don't back out, Christina.  Give one more, man.  One last shot as we end the show here.  All right.  You want one more, you'll get one more.  One more.  Here we go.  Make you happy.  Nice.  Make the 50 wine happy, okay?  You'll get one more.  Let's listen.  All right.  Here goes Christina.  Listen. 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  I do this all day.  I do it a lot.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Give Christy a chance.  She does it all day, but she can do it one more time for us.  All right.  Now, Christy, go ahead.  I have a boyfriend blowing a phone.  No, it's not.  Thank you.  Shh.  Shh.  Go ahead, Christy.  Christy?  Christy?  Christy?  Christy?  She's dark.  Hello?  Christy?  Christy?  Yeah.  Sorry.  The phone died.  Oh, you're going to do it now?  Yes.  Give us one more. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Here goes Christy.  Okay.  Here we go.  Shh.  Shh.  Yeah, because she's crying.  She wants to do it again.  Oh, my God.  No, because she's having her boyfriend put the phone up and blowing in the phone.  No, she's not.  Oh, my God, Christy.  How do you...  What are you such an authority on it for?  How do you know?  Do you not hear it?  Christy... 
[02:48:00]  Hey, we all have our passions.  I'm going...  I'm voting for Christy as far as the grief-off goes.  Yeah, I got to go with Christy.  Christy?  Mike did a call?  Yeah, Christy.  Yeah, I'm going with Christy.  Oh, you guys are sweet.  Oh, sore loser, whatever.  I'm the loser?  Okay.  That's what I want.  Yeah.  Like I care?  Okay, well, then hang up.  Why should I?  Christina, I liked yours.  It had the quality of letting the air out of a truck tire through a London broil.  But Christy's... 
[02:48:30]  I like the tone of Christy's.  Okay, I'm going to go in the corner and cry now because I lost.  All right.  Well, all right, great.  No sore losers.  Well done.  No sore losers.  Everyone's really...  Everyone's a winner here.  No, I was going to say a loser.  Well, yeah.  All right.  But...  No one.  It's the queef-off.  Yeah.  And that's how we ended today.  That was fun.  All right, Christina and Christy, thank you.  There they go.  The queef-off.  They're getting pissed off at each other.  And we got to go.  We're late.  I got to go to the Coliseum for an island again. 
[02:49:00]  Mike DiNicola...  Is your Ash not going with you?  No, not today, Anthony.  Weekend game, sub-500 team.  I told you.  Pete Correale and Mike DiNicola playing Carolines tomorrow.  And we'll have them in to do some quality stuff soon.  Okay.  Okay. </pre>
