<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment dedicated to Ramon, a fictional houseboy character created by production assistant Steve.  In-studio staff, including interns Danny and Nathaniel, contributed to building Ramon's backstory and humorous scenarios involving his wealthy, voiceover artist employer.  Several imagined situations were described, culminating in the playing of radio promos featuring Ramon.

This was followed by a lengthy and dramatic call from Ashley, who claimed to have slept with her father's best friend and godfather.  Her mother was brought on the air, leading to a heated discussion about Ashley's actions and the ensuing family fallout.  The hosts attempted to verify the story with a fake call from XM's legal department.  Ashley called back multiple times, updating the situation: her father had beaten up the man, and she was staying in a hotel.  Further calls revealed Ashley's plans for revenge and her mother's emotional distress. The segment concluded unresolved, with the hosts never definitively confirming the veracity of the story.  Later, it was revealed this was a multi-day prank involving Ashley and her mother, Janice, along with a participant identified only as Fred.  Fred's poor acting gave away the prank, which the hosts later admitted was a stunt designed to improve the show's female audience perception.  The recurring phrase "It's your mom!" was the running joke throughout this prank segment.

Following the prank, Henry Rollins called in for an interview.  He discussed his upcoming Trans-Siberian Railway trip, experiences with the USO in Iraq, his views on the Iraq War, and opinions on comedians like Richard Pryor, George Carlin, and Bill Cosby.  Jay London was present in the studio during this segment. Rollins also made a crude masturbation joke during this call. A previous segment featuring Rollins and a female guest had received negative listener feedback, which the hosts briefly discussed.

The show then moved on to a segment heavily criticizing Pat from CringeHumor.net and Club Soda Kenny.  The hosts played audio of a particularly awkward and offensive interview Pat conducted with Kenny, which included several highly inappropriate and racist jokes. This prompted strong negative reactions from the hosts and a discussion about the quality of Pat's interviewing skills and the offensive nature of Kenny's humor. PJ, another in-studio guest, contributed several crude jokes to the segment.  Audio from a 1993 police interview with Corey Feldman about his relationship with Michael Jackson was played, prompting discussion about Feldman's changing statements and the media coverage of the situation. The hosts criticized a television show covering celebrity legal cases for being superficial. Finally, they discussed the bankruptcy of Liz Sheridan, contrasting her past success with her current financial struggles, and played audio from "How's Your News," a news segment produced by people with disabilities, finding humor in the interviews despite acknowledging the potentially offensive nature of their laughter.  A story from Keith the Cop about being pulled over while searching for Tippi Tom, a homeless person featured on the show, concluded this segment.

Another segment began with Anthony recounting a positive interaction with police officers who recognized him, contrasting it with experiences with officers unfamiliar with the show.  The hosts then discussed the media’s overblown coverage of Florida shark attacks, using statistics to highlight the disproportionate fear-mongering. This discussion included humorous anecdotes and exaggerations about shark attacks.  A call-in segment followed, with listeners sharing their thoughts on the media's sensationalism.  A lengthy, expletive-laced interview with Mike Tyson then took place, covering his recent arrest and other personal issues, punctuated by spelling challenges and humorous exchanges.  The show concluded with a call from Barbara Borman, Linda Lovelace's sister, requesting help with funeral expenses for Lovelace’s grandchildren, to which the hosts offered assistance.

The broadcast ended with a segment following a disturbing phone call with Barbara (details not specified, other than its highly upsetting and shocking nature for the hosts), with Anthony expressing profound unease.  The segment concluded with a standard promotional announcement for the show.

[00:01:30]  VIOLIN PLAYS 
[00:02:00]  VIOLIN PLAYS  VIOLIN PLAYS  VIOLIN PLAYS  VIOLIN PLAYS  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Put my stomach in your pocket.  We love the Ramon stuff, don't we guys? 
[00:04:30]  Of course we do.  Steve, you know, Martini Steve, our production guy, he did this whole series of promos revolving  around this imaginary guy, Ramon.  Ramon and his boss.  And his boss, who's the big voice guy that voices promos.  And apparently Steve has it all worked out, the relationship, everything, with the way  they look, where they live, much too, many too many details about these characters made  up in his little Steve head.  Let's learn about Ramon here. 
[00:05:00]  Ramon.  Ramon.  Ramon.  Ramon.  Ramon.  Ramon.  Ramon, peroxide your hair, and speak in an effeminate fashion.  Ramon.  All right.  Fucking terrible.  Can't hear anybody says, I fuck Martini Steve in the mouth. 
[00:05:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Bopple.  What's up with you and your imaginary friend, Ramon?  He's not my imaginary friend.  He's just the...  Did you make him up?  Yeah, I did.  He's yours.  He's my creation.  I'll certainly take credit for that.  But Ramon is the byproduct of something I learned when I was working at NEW.  They told me that a lot of the deep voice guys that do voiceover for movies and for TV. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  Check this out.  Listen, this is...  I know.  But here's the explanation.  This is exactly where it came from.  They do a lot of their voiceover work from home in a home studio on ISDN lines.  So a lot of them are just traipsing around home in their bathrobes or sweatpants, making  millions of dollars, mind you, doing voice work.  So you believe there's some guy walking around and his house boy is there.  And he has a house boy.  And as he's doing these voiceovers, sometimes things happen and he's got to go, Ramon.  Exactly. 
[00:06:30]  And lean.  Wow.  So you feel like you're one of these big voice guys and you need a little  house boy.  Oh, no, no, no.  That's why I pitch my voice down because I have to make it sound like it's not me.  Right.  So...  Yeah, exactly.  So not only does he have an imaginary friend named Ramon, he has an imaginary him.  Oh, this is not going well.  Did you just call from Jersey two minutes ago?  What do you think?  You think way too much into this.  No, this is how you be...  I sit in a room with no windows, mind you, for hours on end.  So sometimes you're...  What's the profile of Ramon?  What kind of person is he? 
[00:07:00]  Well, that's interesting.  Is he short?  Because I brought this up with Nathaniel and Danny yesterday and they each have a different  visualization for what Ramon looks like.  Really?  All right.  Get those guys in here.  Look at them.  I'm all excited.  They get air time.  All right.  So what...  You know, I think Danny said it might...  Danny said I think he looked something like Ricky, the other intern.  But then Nathaniel had a totally different look for what Ramon might have looked like.  And for all I know, everybody's got something to you.  Danny, do you think it's...  I believe he looks like the cover of Rent Boys. 
[00:07:30]  Danny, do you think it's a little weird that Steve has an imaginary friend named Ramon?  It's a little strange.  And what do you think Ramon looks like?  To me, he looks something like Hervé Villachez if he was normal-sized.  Oh, okay.  But with the Ricky mustache.  Nathaniel?  Do you think it's weird that he has an imaginary friend?  I don't know.  I kind of like Steve.  No, it does.  Yeah.  It's not about liking him.  Do you know that we smash the people we really like on this show?  Yeah.  Well, I think he does have a whole persona worked out. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Definitely sort of a...  Yeah, I think Steve's given a lot of thought to this.  Yeah.  I mean, he hasn't stuck his hand in a sock and started talking to him.  It's probably good, but it could be soon.  No, no, no.  That's not happening.  But you do have to...  Is Ramon with you right now?  No, Ramon is not in the room.  Can you channel Ramon?  No, because you'll never hear from Ramon.  You'll only hear Ramon being referenced.  You do hear from Ramon.  Steve's not here right now, Mrs. Tarrant.  Ramon is the little boy who lives in my mouth.  Is Ramon your Jenny Piccolo? 
[00:08:30]  It's a friend that we'll just never see.  It was Jenny Piccolo, right, from Happy Day?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Ramon will...  Yeah.  Well, kind of.  Ramon will never be referenced in the first person.  You'll never hear, like, you know, a little voice pop up and go, yes, sir.  You'll never hear that.  You will only hear Ramon being referenced as, like, he's being addressed or in the third  person.  His name...  Do you want him to talk, but, you know, he's not supposed to?  No, it's...  You like ice cream, Ramon? 
[00:09:00]  Do you want to secretly be Ramon?  Oh, no, no, no.  Ramon's a houseboy.  Yeah.  Ramon's a house...  You don't aspire to be Ramon.  I'm thinking you might want to be a houseboy.  No.  Kind of like where someone tells you what to do.  I'll bet you in his mind, Ramon is probably 5'10", very svelte, smooth abs, unclipped,  hung 10, fat, doesn't speak English, willing to do anything for a buck.  Is that who Ramon is?  Ramon.  Do you have an example of Ramon?  Does Derek have a promo he can play featuring Ramon? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, he'll find it in a second.  How many Ramon promos are there?  Honestly, there was only...  I just did the second one yesterday, but I'm thinking there could be a series of Ramon.  Of course there will be.  When do you think maybe we should take Ramon to the doctor?  All right, let's...  If Derek's ready, let's hear the Ramon promo, Anthony.  All right.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramon, clean this up. 
[00:10:00]  It's a little weird, Steve.  Of course it is.  Your houseboy's got to clean the crap out of your shoes.  Do you pay him well, at least?  No, houseboys generally don't get paid well.  Not making a lot of money?  No, I mean, let's say maybe he's Guatemalan.  Maybe he's uneducated.  He's doing great production for the radio show, but I've got to tell you, it's a little weird.  The Ramon thing.  Did you buy him after his mother was killed in the tsunami because of child slavery?  Did a tree go through his mom's head?  No, actually, he is from Central America, I believe. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, Central America.  Well, no, I mean, the tsunami hit around the Philippines, so, you know, you're certainly  not going to find any Ramones out there.  Is Ramon's last name Robinson, by any chance?  Hey, good reference, Anthony.  Good reference, but no.  And he didn't have to dress up.  That's very good.  Oh.  That's a fun of it, though.  All right, listen.  Let's listen to the second Ramon.  Promo.  This is, we debuted this earlier this morning.  I just love a drive in the country, laughing with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:11:00]  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon, call 9-1-1.  Ramon.  Now the Ramon promos are that much better and funnier.  Because now every time I hear this on the replay, I'm going to drive off the road. 
[00:11:30]  Ramon, call 9-1-1.  It sounded like you almost said, clean this up, but you went, call 9-1-1.  I was trying to enunciate it in the same fashion.  Call 9-1-1.  Now, Steve, why wouldn't you call 9-1-1?  Yeah.  Why does Ramon have to do everything for you?  Because, well, it's not, it's also, it's not me, but Ramon is a houseboy assigned to  the menial tasks that this deep voice guy does not feel that he's...  Wait, I have a problem.  What?  You're taking a leisurely drive in the country. 
[00:12:00]  Why is Ramon with you?  Yeah.  See, there's a menial task that has to be, that has to be, that has to be, that has to  be taken care of.  Yeah, roadhead.  Yeah, exactly.  Your mule is dirty, he needs to be cleaned.  Ramon, lap this up.  Perfect example, you go to a self-serve gas station, do you think this guy, this wealthy  voiceover artist is going to be...  Ramon, top off my tank.  Right, right.  Exactly.  You're a couple weeks away from coming in here with a scarf.  You know, I'm thinking that this guy has, you know, almost a hef outfit, like a, not 
[00:12:30]  a leisure suit, what's it called?  An ascot and a smoking jacket.  Thank you.  How did Ramon feel?  Is Ramon angry at the guy?  Ramon could be angry, he might be bitter.  He might be bitter.  He's crazy, by the way.  Crazy Steve.  You haven't thought about this way too long, there's a profile on your imaginary friend  Ramon.  Yeah.  Behind his back, does he like...  Are you, or the person that you're voicing in these spots, that's not Ramon obviously, 
[00:13:00]  is he married?  No.  No, actually, you know what?  You know, now that I think of it, there are two, two of the little cartoons on the website  are pretty representative of what this deep voice guy and Ramon might look like, and Ramon  is, I suck, Ramon is a very short, or potentially a very short pygmy.  I don't want to alter it too much because, yeah, because I don't want to alter it.  Let people imagine their own Ramon.  Ramon should be, you know, everyone should have their own Ramon. 
[00:13:30]  Should people start sending in maybe drawings and cartoons of what they think you and Ramon  are...  I think that's a great idea.  ...are like and look like.  There's some talented artists there.  Has Ramon ever stood there and just thrown firecrackers while other people were preparing  to rob the house?  Yeah, I do.  You got that?  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember the name though.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Was it Boogie Nights?  Yeah.  I knew the scene.  I didn't remember the movie. 
[00:14:00]  Boogie Nights.  He's right.  Yeah.  Ramon.  That is a typical Ramon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy throwing the firecrackers around the house.  All right.  Well...  That's a Ramon.  Ramon takes care of the menial tasks that you can't be bothered with because, you know,  you're off making the money and you can pay somebody, you know, three bucks an hour  to go and clean up diarrhea.  Really?  For a casual thing, you have his salary already worked out.  Yeah.  How much does he make?  Does he live for free in like the...  Well...  In the...  What do they call it?  That other house...  Servant's quarters.  Servant's... 
[00:14:30]  No.  The pool house?  Like the pool house or something?  Yeah.  He could potentially.  He could potentially.  You know, you've got to remember, he's...  You know, he maybe doesn't have a great grasp of the English language.  Ha ha ha.  You know, he's from Central America.  You know, uneducated.  And no grasp of U.S. law as well.  I didn't say he was underage.  I didn't say he was...  Oh, no, no.  I didn't say he was underage.  We weren't saying that.  Give the Photoshop people some work on Wack Bag.  Photoshop people.  It's not Steve, so, you know, I don't think you have to Photoshop Steve in. 
[00:15:00]  It's a deep voice guy with a little helper named Ramon.  Sure.  Jesus.  Yeah.  No, that's...  Danny.  You've got, like, a guy with a pith helmet, like an old...  Oh, yeah, exactly.  An old adventurer.  Yeah.  With the optic thing.  Yeah, he's got a monocle.  Oh, monocle.  Thank you.  And, like, a pith helmet and binoculars.  Mm-hmm.  His name is actually Colonel Wetpants.  Yeah, Colonel with, like, the little handlebar mustache thing going like, well, there I was. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, exactly.  African elephant hunting when all of the sudden Ramon came over.  And then Ramon is a black guy.  And he's a pygmy with a bone through his nose and in his hair.  With a big afro and, like, bracelets of bone.  Almost like a shorter LeVar Burton type.  So Ramon's not black.  No, I don't see Ramon as being black.  No, I mean, but that's, you know...  I see Ramon as...  That's why I was kind of making a reference.  Yeah, Central American, maybe.  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe even Mexican.  Hairless. 
[00:16:00]  I see Ramon as hairless.  See?  You know, there's...  Now we've got a completely different representation of Ramon than...  You see a very hairy Ramon.  Of course you do, Steve.  See?  Really?  No.  A mini bear.  All Ramon can say in English is sweet and cozy.  Cozy face.  All right, well...  Oh, thank you, Steve.  We just...  Anthony and I just noticed this whole Ramon thing that was kind of taking on a life of  its own, and we had to kind of...  I thought you guys liked the Ramon things.  We do.  Oh, okay. 
[00:16:30]  And now they're even better, now that we have the backstory.  Are you kidding me?  Of course.  Oh, okay, cool.  Who's not going to be paying attention to the Ramon promos, and everyone's going to  be looking forward to the next one in the series?  Okie dokie.  Ramon.  We're the only radio show that discusses show promos.  I know.  The ins and outs of the show promos.  Well, we got a lunatic making them.  There's imaginary friends.  Dude, we're all...  And I mean myself, obviously.  We're all psychotic around here. 
[00:17:00]  Bunch of lunatics.  We got some problems in this room.  This is Aaron Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation Champion.  Pleasure for me to the Anthony and Opium and pleasure to come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, and hello to all people, to the wrestling, to the...  I'm pleasure to be here.  Do you remember that time when the girl Ashley called in?  Hmm.  Ashley.  Hmm.  She's 19 and she slept with her dad's best friend, who's not married, but also her godfather. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, okay.  Why can't you read, right?  Now I remember.  I read good.  No, you don't.  You just blew the whole bit.  Ashley calls to tell us she's 19 and slept with her dad's best friend, who is not only married, but also her godfather.  That's what I said.  I don't know, did he?  Godfather.  Ah, they're saying you didn't.  Ah-ha.  What do they know?  They ain't even fucking smart enough to get paid, motherfuckers.  All right.  Well, if this was taped, we could rewind the tape to see who was right, so I guess I'll just have to take your word for it. 
[00:18:00]  Thank you for having sex with me.  Your goddaughter, Frank.  All right.  Here's Ashley, part one.  We'll come back after part one to intro part two, which will lead into part three, which will lead into stupid part four, where something interesting happens.  Here's part one.  Well, thanks.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I know.  Let's say hi to Ashley in PA.  Ashley.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  Good, how are you?  I'm doing really good. 
[00:18:30]  Me too.  Mmm.  Ashley.  Mmm, Ashley.  That's a name only a hot girl can have.  That's right.  You can't be fat and say, hi, I'm Ashley.  How hot is Ashley?  I'm pretty hot.  Pretty hot?  Uh-huh.  Where are you from, Pennsylvania?  Hazleton, yeah.  Hazleton.  Okay.  Not far from Reading.  No.  And why are you calling the show today?  Well, I want to play call your mom, but mine is real. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, you want to confess something to your mom?  Uh-huh.  I slept with my dad's best friend last night.  How old are you?  Old enough.  How old are you?  Nineteen.  How old is your dad's best friend?  He's 38.  I want to whack my bag.  Is this real?  Yeah.  So how did this come about?  Well, I liked him for a while and I just, I don't know.  Is the, uh, is your father's friend, uh, married? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  He's married?  Yeah.  With kids?  No, he doesn't have kids.  Got you.  And, uh, is his wife hot?  Uh, she's all right, I guess.  And did you, uh, did you, um, make the move or did he?  We both did.  Both did.  So he's been coming over the house a lot?  Um, we've been meeting in a secret location.  Ooh, secret.  It's a secret.

Hopefully where the hell she was last night.  Ah.  Why is that?  Was she missing?  Well, she was supposed to come home by like one o'clock because that's her curfew.  And I've been lying to her dad all fucking night about where she's been.  And, um, I'm a little pissed.  Does, uh, does she live with you still?  Yes.  Uh, she's got a little room that she's had since, what, she was a little kid?

And where was, uh, where did she say she was going last night?  She was going out to the movies and dinner.  And then she was going to be home after she went to some club up in Wilkes-Barre.  With friends did she go to the movies?  Yeah, that's what she said.  What friend?  Janine, why?  Oh, just wondering.  Uh, Janine's.  Janine, one of our good friends?  Yeah.  Yeah, Janine's, uh, she's a troublemaker, isn't she?  Yeah, she can be. 
[00:22:00]  I'd rather not hang out with Janine.  A bad seed.  Yeah.  What, uh, movie were they supposed to go see last night?  The Grudge or something like that.  Ah, it's a little scary movie.  Ah, yes.  All right, uh, let's put your daughter on the line here.  Okay.  This is Ashley.  Ashley!  Yeah?  Hi, uh, we got your mom, Janice, on the phone here.  And she's wondering what, uh, where you were last night until, uh, how late there, Mom?  She never fucking came home at all.  Oh, Jesus.  You gotta be...  She's still not home.  She's still not home. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Well, maybe she's working.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Uh, Ashley?  Yeah?  Would you like to tell your mother where you were last night?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Mom?  Yes?  Um, I, God promised not to get mad and I don't want you to tell Dad what I'm gonna tell you.  I've been lying to him all night.  What else do you want me to lie to him about?  Um...  Don't use any last names, by the way. 
[00:23:00]  Okay.  I slept with Fred last night.  Fred?  Daddy's friend?  Yeah.  What are you out of your mind?  I'm friends with...  Oh.  Mom, please don't tell Dad.  I...  I don't...  Oh, don't tell Dad.  Sure.  You tell Dad.  Oh.  Oh, and you're doing this to me on air?  Oh, you're lucky your dad's never heard of this show.  Or he'd be in state pen by tonight because he'll come...  What are you getting all mad about? 
[00:23:30]  His age and your age and you're my baby and he's fucking a baby?  Well, you're not, but you are.  You're my kid.  Well, Ashley, what happened last night?  Well, we went out to eat and we went out to a movie and then he took me to the hotel  and we fooled around.  You don't have to worry about me telling your dad.  I'm going to go fucking kill him. 
[00:24:00]  What's this guy like, Janice?  Well, see, I guess, um, two-faced, I would say.  Um, he's been eating dinner here.  He's been eating dinner across the table with you since you're two years old.  Oh, my God.  I can't help it.  I'm attracted to him.  You're attracted to him.  Wait, you fooled her out.  You just kissed him, right?  No, we went all the way.  Oh, you slut.  Is this the first time?  I'm not a slut.  It's my first time doing it. 
[00:24:30]  What the fuck are you freaking out for?  Because he's 38 years old.  He just had his birthday.  Are you, uh, friends with, um, this guy's, uh, wife?  Yes, I am.  And Lisa is not going to be, oh, my God.  Lisa is your godmother.  How am I going to even try and tell her this?  Lisa, the guy's wife is, is the godmother of your daughter?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  It's a very sacred position to the Sicilian people.  And, Ashley, you been fooling around with him a while or no? 
[00:25:00]  I fooled around with him a couple times, yeah.  But this was the first time you went all the way last night?  Yeah.  And it was in a seedy hotel somewhere?  Yeah, it's in, it's in Hazleton.  Yeah, every hotel here is a seedy.  Mom, uh, what are you going to, what are you going to do?  Are you going to tell the wife, maybe?  Uh-huh.  No.  Mom, you better not, I don't want you to tell anybody.  I just didn't want you to tell anybody.  You don't tell anybody.  You take me on the radio and you don't want me to tell anybody.  Oh, you have some nerve. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ashley, was he good?  Uh-huh.  Ashley was.  He better damn well be because now you are out.  What do you mean, I'm out?  You can go live with him after he gets a divorce.  Well, fuck it, then I will.  Yeah, you will.  This is bullshit.  Ashley, I did not raise you like this.  What happened to college?  Are you going to still go?  Are you going to still have a life?  Or are you going to just hook up with some old man and live off of him for the rest of your freaking life? 
[00:26:00]  He makes good money.  Well, you know what?  You're smarter than that and you're being a complete moron right now.  Complete moron.  And this is the something cute you had to tell me.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Oh, my God.  So bad.  Oh, God.  Calm down.  My blood pressure is shooting up faster than anything.  You know, you're going to put me in my fucking grave.  I'm not that old, but I'm going to be going to my fucking grave soon. 
[00:26:30]  Can I ask a question?  Uh-huh.  Not to be.  Ashley?  Yeah.  Was he a big boy?  Yeah.  Fucking Christ.  I hope it was worth it.  That's all I got to tell you.  It better fucking have done well been worth it.  Was he cut or uncut?  He's cut.  What position did you enjoy? 
[00:27:00]  Um, I was mostly on my back.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's great.  Eating dinner over your house.  Now he's eating somewhere else.  Oh, God.  Mom, please don't tell Dad.  What?  Yeah, like, I want to lose a husband.  Mm-hmm.  Why would you lose a husband?  Because they'll fucking kill him.  Why?  That's his best friend and his daughter.  Mm.  So what's the problem? 
[00:27:30]  Wouldn't you want to fucking kill him?  I mean, right now, I'm, like, getting ready to go to his job and blow his fucking head off.  Oh, boy.  That'd be the second time in two days he's had that done.  I hear a kid in the background.  I enjoy my way, though, fucking little bitch.  So did you notice there was some flirting going on there, Mom?  No.  No?  And what's going on with the kid in the background?  I have babies that are crying.  And this is your oldest?  That's my oldest.  Ashley's your oldest. 
[00:28:00]  And I'm hoping, you know what?  He's never allowed in this fucking house again, because how is he going to go after my 12-year-old?  Is he going to go after my fucking 2-year-old now?  Well, what?  Maybe he'll go after your brother.  You got a little farm there for him.  Yeah, they really, it's like the Expos of pedophiles.  So what are you going to do to keep from raising another slut?  Fucking lock him up.  You home after school.  You just come home after school.  Could you quiet that baby the same way they quieted the baby at the end of Caligula? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, my God.  Last episode of MASH.  I'm just going to come home and we'll talk.  You can't come home.  You wouldn't be quiet.  I've been up all night, not only with the baby, but walking the fucking halls, waiting for your ass to come in this door.  Well, she was getting laid.  And you're out.  You know something?  I wouldn't believe this unless it was some shithole in Pennsylvania that they were coming from. 
[00:29:00]  The fact that it's Hazleton.  I know.  It's totally, I believe this could happen there.  Yeah.  All right, Ashley, anything else you want to say to your mom?  No, but I want to play with my pants.  Oh, you've got to go.  You know what?  Your bags will be at the fucking steps when you get home.  She's, your mom's heartbroken.  I did not raise my child to do stuff like this.  Oh, boy.  We might live in a town where fucking people walk around and do shit that God only knows what, but I raised you better than that. 
[00:29:30]  Apparently not.  Mom, would you play a game of mother-daughter once in my pants?  Jimmy.  Not a bad idea.  Why not?  All right, well.  She's upset.  Well, it looks like you guys got some things to work out there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  They say, I'll come home and we'll talk.  Oh, yeah.  Come home.  Yeah, we'll talk.  How many times did you guys have sex last night, Ashley? 
[00:30:00]  Four.  Yeah, we're going to talk.  Four?  About four.  About four times.  Not bad.  Not bad for the old guy.  Did he rub his helmet on your brown eye?  Uh-huh.  Did he try anything, like, freaky?  No.  Like the whole situation isn't freaky enough?  No, he was nice about it.  Yeah, he was a real gentleman.  And does he like you?  I think.  All right.  Janice, you all right?  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, boy.  She's just reflecting, looking at her other children, thinking, you know, who's next?  Yeah.  You're not necessarily going to fail with the other ones, too.  Oh.  I don't want to cry.  What?  I don't want to cry.  Don't cry.  You just basically told me that everything that we've been living and everything, I thought  we could trust these people, and apparently we can't.  I've known them for that long, and this is the way they're going to be.  Yeah, it's one of those things, you know, I'm sure she's upset she can't get the image out 
[00:31:00]  of her head of this guy, just on top of her little girl, you know, pounding away, and  that's an image that'll probably stick with her for quite a while, both of them just naked.  Yeah, and your descriptions are so helpful.  Get that image out of your head.  Sorry, I was just trying to convey that, you know, it's probably very upsetting to you.  All the trust, the holidays spent together.  Her little teenage body, just wanting and wanting.  And a couple of years ago, you remember her like, you know, the little girl. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  And now all of a sudden she's a young woman, and this guy that you've entrusted is just  ravening her in a hotel room.  Yeah.  Just fouling your daughter over and over again.  Now you're running back through your mind, thinking of all the times he was over, that  you might have thought he was looking at her a little weird.  Oh.  When she was 13, maybe?  Yeah, and now I'm worried that he's looking at my other children.  Well, then dress him better.  All right, Ashley, any final thoughts there? 
[00:32:00]  No, I'll just, I'll be home and we can talk about it then.  Yeah, you need to come home so we can talk about it.  Yeah, and you need to come home, like, soon, okay?  Yeah.  Mommy's not mad at you, not at all.  Oh, boy.  Ashley, where are you now?  I'm at the hotel.  Which hotel?  The one right down the street or by the mall?  The one by the mall.  The one by the mall.  Okay, why don't you just wait there and I'll come get you. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, boy.  Ashley, are you attractive?  She's a beautiful girl.  Does she have email?  Oh.  Jimmy.  All right, Ashley.  Janice, thank you.  Oh.  I didn't know this was going to happen today.  Ashley said she just wanted to tell you something on the show today.  Yeah.  I didn't know it was going to be this.  But we told you there was a prize attached, and you actually win Dr. Spock's book on how  to be a better parent.  Yeah, I should have used it 19 years ago. 
[00:33:00]  Right across her ass.  Either that or a hanger.  Yeah.  Or how to choose better, Frick.  You just got...  Are you going to come pick me up for what?  Yeah, I'm coming to get you.  All right.  All right, we're going to need an update on this story.  So why don't you guys call us tomorrow or Thursday or something, all right?  Oh, you want to put Ashley on hold, because Eric wants her number.  We're going to put Ashley on hold, and Janice, we're going to put you on hold, all right?  Okay.  We're putting you both on hold.  All right, put... 
[00:33:30]  Shut up.  All right, thanks, Janice.  Oh, you're welcome.  And there they go.  Oh, that was good.  Hmm.  Interesting.  I mean, I don't know what to make of that story.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I have a full rod.  He is all like...  How does he...  How does he get a rod from that one?  Janice?  Just hearing mommy's tears.  Janice?  Yes?  Jim has a full rod after listening to this story.  I'm not some 38-year-old creep, though.  He's 35.  36.  36. 
[00:34:00]  36-year-old creep.  And he was very turned on by your daughter's story.  How are you going to confront this guy?  I don't even know.  I say just tell his fucking wife and let her freaking deal with him.  All right, why don't we call the wife?  Hey, do you have her number?  You want to call the wife?  Oh, I would never do that to Lisa.  I'd never do anything like that.  Why don't you call Fred?  You don't have to do it to Lisa.  Why don't you call Fred?  Oh, that's a good one.  He's at work right now.  Exactly.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Let's confront Fred at work.  Why not? 
[00:34:30]  The way he used your trust just to get your little...  All right, meet me down the street at the hotel.  All right, take care, parents.  Meet me down the street at the hotel.  You know what he must have been thinking when he saw that 18-year-old ass?  Yeah.  The 19-year-old ass for the first time?  Truly turned 19-year-old.  Just turned 19.  Phone rings once for the signal.  She meets him outside by the sycamore tree.  Daddy, can I give you a hummus?  Daddy, I love when you touch my bad place. 
[00:35:00]  Daddy, show me your monkey.  Daddy, what's that popcorn bucket?  Daddy, my poopy hurts.  Daddy, my poopy hurts.  Anthony, do I look as young as your girlfriend? 
[00:35:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I forgot how good that was.  Let's get right to part two, because I can't wait.  All right, it's Ashley part two.  Opie and Anthony coming up.  That's me.  That's Anthony.  That's Jimmy Norman.  Well, Jimmy.  Here's Ashley part two.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:36:00]  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Controversy has broken out on the O&A show.  Ashley was on the line about 15 minutes ago, claiming that she slept with her father's best friend. 
[00:36:30]  She wanted to tell her mom.  We got the mom on the phone.  And very awkward phone call to listen to.  But we got to be honest, half the listeners are completely buying it, and the other half are not buying it whatsoever.  We're divided in here, too.  Yeah, we're kind of on the fence in here.  I don't know.  You know, I'd kind of, I'd love to think it's real.  Yeah.  I sure would.  Right.  But I don't know.  We still have Ashley on the line, and we're going to try to get to the bottom of this.  She can't hear us right now.  And we're going to make believe, like, you know, where someone from the legal department or something from XM Salary Radio wants to get to the bottom of this. 
[00:37:00]  Okay?  Yeah.  So, why don't we get her?  Yeah.  Okay.  Ashley?  Yeah.  Hi.  This is Chuck Schick from XM Legal.  Hey.  How are you doing?  We need to fill out some forms regarding the content of your conversation on the air. 
[00:37:30]  Okay.  And we absolutely need to know if it was true or false, because there could be legal ramifications for the program.  So, we, it's not for the air.  We just want to know if this really did happen or not.  It's fine either way.  Yeah.  So, you're saying this absolutely did happen.  It's happened.  Okay.  And you were telling your mom for the first time.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:38:00]  Check that.  Because, you know, we don't, we don't want to be sued.  No, I'm...  This side, you know.  So, if it's, if it's true, we, we will then write down that it is indeed true.  And if not, that's fine too.  But you're saying this absolutely did happen and your confrontation with your mother was absolutely legitimate.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, thank you very much.  Okay, thanks.  And please hold.  Uh, Janice? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah?  There's your confirmation.  That's, that's real.  You shameless hustler.  Oh, okay.  Lou, Lou.  Lou, Mary.  Oh, Mary had sex with Lou.  Mary and Lou.  The Ted Knight sound.  Oh, Mary.  Oh.  Marie, Mary had sex with Lou.  All the trust that we put in Lou.  He slept with Mary.  He slept with Mary. 
[00:39:00]  Jesus.  Well.  Ashley, you need to be in the lobby in 15 minutes because I will be there for you.  Okay.  Just tell her there's a 38-year-old cock waiting for her and I'm sure she'll be right there.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that this is actually true.  I can't believe this.  Yeah.  You guys got some, um, talking to do.  Some healing.  And you know what, Janice?  And if you need it, we do have, uh, Jerry Springer's number.  If that'll help you guys.  I'll say I'm sorry to hear that it's true, but then there's a part of me that's glad 
[00:39:30]  it is because I'd hate to think I got a fat boner for nothing.  All right, Janice, any final thoughts?  Because we have to move on.  Yeah.  Take care of yourselves and each other.  That's right.  All right?  Okay.  All right, we're going to let them, uh, let them be.  Wait, Janice?  Yes.  Yes.  Two yeses.  Two yeses and you hang up on her.  Wow.  All right.  Beat it. 
[00:40:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  That was so good.  I can't wait to get to part three.  We should just rush right into Ashley part three.  Headlong.  Headlong.  Because she's going to call to let us know what happened the next day.  She said her dad beat the shit out of her lover, kicked out.  It was a long haul thing.  It's kind of like a soap opera, right?  Yeah.  It's yes.  All right, well, here's, uh, Ashley part three.  Ooh.  It's the worst.  All right.  You guys want an update on, um, Ashley? 
[00:40:30]  Ashley from, uh, yesterday who told her mom.  This was the real deal.  We weren't buying it, but then we were able to, uh, confirm that this actually happened.  Yeah.  We had Ashley call.  She's 19 years old.  She's had a crush on her father's best friend for a while.  Uh, I guess the best friend, uh, I guess the best friend, the father's best friend is her  godfather too, right?  Or something like that?  Uh, well, I know that the, the, the best friend, the one that had sex with the daughter,  his wife, because he's married. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  Is the godmother.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Of the girl that he had sex with.  So I don't know if he's the godfather.  Yeah.  So basically this guy's been coming to the house since Ashley was like two or something.  And, uh, Ashley's mom and dad are good friends with this guy and his wife.  Don Corleone, it is an honor to have sex with your daughter on the day of your daughter's  wedding.  So I like when you put that in my mouth from your grandson, Frank. 
[00:41:30]  Can I fuck your daughter for old time's sake?  And the dick she sucked was a masculine dick.  You can act like a whore.  What's the matter with you?  So we have an update here.  Uh-huh.  Um, Ashley decided to tell her mom live on our show.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  Wow.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:42:00]  Mock, mock, mock, mock, mock.  What days did you have sex with him?  Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday.  Yeah, so she decided to tell her mom live on our show, and we had the wacky bit alert  happening in our heads, but it turns out it was the real deal, so we were able to confirm  it.  But we have Ashley on the line to give us an update, and I hear it's not a good update.  Uh-oh.  It's not going to be a good update here.  So once again, to the program we go with Ashley. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, Ashley.  Oh, wait a minute, Ashley.  Damn it.  Hold on.  Ashley.  Yeah.  Okay, you're there.  Hello.  What's going on?  They threw me out.  Fred got the shit kicked out of them.  I don't know if my mom called Lisa or not.  She said she did, but Lisa's in St. Petersburg, so.  All right, let's back up.  Who's he?  So after the show, you went home?  Yeah.  And I heard that your stuff was all over the lawn? 
[00:43:00]  No.  Huh?  No.  Oh, that's what Eric was saying.  Did you get thrown out?  Yeah, they threw me out.  And where are you staying?  I'm at the hotel now, but I think I'm just going to go stay with a couple of friends.  And what happened to the guy?  My dad went after him.  Oh, how did he find out?  My mom told him.  She wound up telling him.  You wrecked a friendship that probably goes back 20 years. 
[00:43:30]  Well.  Eh, who cares?  He got laid.  So now what are you going to do?  That's the only important thing.  What are you going to do now?  Probably stay with friends.  I don't know.  So why would you call the show and announce this to the world?  I wanted to be a little bitch, I guess.  Backfire to my face.  You wanted to be a little bitch?  Yeah.  Get back at your parents for a little something?  Yeah.  Why would you want to do that to your mom?  Did your mom do something to you? 
[00:44:00]  No, she's just been ragging on me lately.  Yeah.  Yeah, when they rag on you, you've got to have sex with a family friend.  Exactly.  Boy, you really showed her.  Now you're living in a seedy hotel and with friends.  What do you look like?  I don't know.  I'm good looking.  I have real long brown hair, blue eyes.  I'm about 5'2".  All right.  The important thing.  How much do you weigh?  The last time I weighed myself, I was 107. 
[00:44:30]  107.  Okay.  That's good.  Very nice.  So you're not a fat girl?  No.  Because I'm not saying it's wrong to ruin a family friendship, but you've just got to  not do it over a fat girl.  No.  No.  Have you talked to the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were together again last night.  Oh, you were, were you?  Is he footing the bill for the hotel?  Yeah.  Wait, so did your father find him?  Yeah.  And he beat him up a little bit?  Yeah, my dad gave him a pretty good beating. 
[00:45:00]  And then you had sex with the guy again last night?  Yeah, we were, uh, he said that he'd get me an apartment, but he'd pay for it.  I don't know.  So did you bang him after he was all beat up over there?  It's so sad.  My nose is running.  Oh, all right.  And I'm trying to signal that I need the paper towels that are right in front of Ben, and  they're like looking at everything.  What do you need?  You need something for the show? 
[00:45:30]  Well, I just didn't know.  You're looking at Ben, and Ben's turning the page, so I thought you wanted me to signal  Ben.  I was really going to get him back.  I tried to talk him into Spain.  Wait.  So I was going to blow him over the radio.  You were?  What?  You should anyway.  What do you mean you were?  How about...  He's not here.  What's that?  I'm here.  Where is he?  Having his wounds tended to?  He went back.  He went to work.  You were going to blow him on the radio?  Mm-hmm.  It's better and better every day.  You know, you're right.  Can we get your mom on the line while you blow? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, my God.  Blow on the radio.  What I wanted to do?  I wanted to get my mom on the other line, and if my dad was still home, I wanted to  get them both on the other line.  What do you...  And tell him that I wanted to apologize to them, and I was going to blow him over the  radio and just say, here, fuck you.  Stay nuts.  All right.  Why do you hate your parents so much?  Because they rag on me all the time.  I haven't been hating your parents.  That's just a fun little prank, Hopi.  And what kind of ragging do they do?  Go to school.  Don't dress like a slut. 
[00:46:30]  Get a job.  Clean your room.  Clean your room.  Get that older man's cock out of your mouth.  What kind of ragging could they possibly do?  The normal ragging.  What?  What you guys said.  They're just constantly on my back about something.  What?  No, I have nothing.  Did Fred get beat up badly?  Huh?  Did your dad belt Fred?  My dad get the shit out of him, yeah.  So, but would Fred go on the phone while your dad's in line and get a Hummer like that? 
[00:47:00]  Well, he won't.  That's why Fred wouldn't stick around.  He said he wasn't going to dip with it.  Oh, he's the one that put the kibosh on that whole thing.  All right, well.  You really want to get even with your parents.  You come to New York and blow a comedian.  That will really, I'm telling you, that will really bother them.  You know, you, I think.  I want to live with you, Norm.  She wants to live with you.  I couldn't have you live with me because I like living alone, but you could certainly spend a couple evenings.  Okay.  Yeah, you know, we've got about 12 guys that work on the show. 
[00:47:30]  I think we could kind of just rotate you around a little bit.  You know, you're ripe for a career in porn.  This is perfect.  This is like a perfect resume.  Yeah, you really are a porn star in the making.  I mean, what are you going to do for a living eventually?  What do you want to do with your life?  Small town, Pennsylvania.  She's going to go to the big city and just start hobbin' knob.  Nice.  Wait, you got her mom on the line here?  Yeah, I have her on hold.  I mean, I have her off the air so she can't hear.  Okay, let's put the mom on the phone, too. 
[00:48:00]  Mike is saying when was the last time, she said the last time she weighed herself she was 107.  When was that?  1982.  That was a little trickery she did.  She said last time I weighed myself it was 107.  Janice.  Nah, I'm kidding.  Janice, your daughter keeps calling us every day here.  Yeah.  So what happened after the show?  Well, I called up Lisa and I told Lisa.  You did.  You told the wife of the guy.  Yeah.  And what did she, how did she react?  Oh, she was furious. 
[00:48:30]  She's actually getting on a plane to come home today.  Why was she in St. Petersburg?  Visiting her family.  You called her in St. Petersburg?  Yeah.  You ruined her vacation?  You couldn't tell her when she got back?  No, I don't think that's something you should wait on.  And what did she say?  She was furious.  She was furious with me, even.  Why?  What did you do?  Besides raising a slut.  Yeah, she was furious with me and she was furious with her husband and she's coming home to 
[00:49:00]  deal with him and then I think she's going after my daughter.  And I guess your daughter was in the hotel again last night or the motel, whatever.  Whatever.  I don't know where she is.  I kicked her out.  Oh, you haven't talked to her since?  No.  Now, you told your husband also?  Oh, yeah.  And what did he say?  Well, he disappeared.  He came back later and a couple hours later he had some bloody knuckles and he said he took  care of it.  Took care of it.  Did he throw his bloody gi in a dumpster? 
[00:49:30]  And claimed that his dog was in a fight?  The dog.  I'm still freaked out over that story.  Uh, wow.  So, you haven't talked to your daughter since?  No.  What would you like to say to her?  I just can't believe that you would do something like this to me.  Yeah.  I've done my best to raise a decent family.  Where do you think you went wrong?  Not enough discipline?  It must have been. 
[00:50:00]  Maybe not enough guidance?  I don't know.  I'm there.  I stayed home every day.  I let my husband go to work.  I stayed home with the kids.  I don't know.  You were home, but were you really there?  I don't know how to tell you this, but, um, uh, your daughter wanted to, uh, give your  husband's friend a BJ live on our show today.  Oh, my God.  But she wanted you on the other line.  She was going to say she was, uh, going to apologize, and then she was going to, you 
[00:50:30]  know, start sucking and say, fuck you.  Why is he doing this to me?  Oh, Paul.  I'm not doing it to you.  I'm doing it to myself.  Oh.  What have I done to you that you need to repay me like this?  Good question.  We wanted answered immediately.  Ragging on me?  Ragging on you?  I'm your freaking mother.  What else do you want me to do?  Oh, okay.  You could go ahead and do that.  I don't care if you play in traffic.  Ooh.  Easy with that harsh criticism.  Yeah, what kind of nagging do you do?  I expect certain things done, you know, like I don't expect to find her pile of laundry 
[00:51:00]  at the bottom of my steps so, you know, that everybody falls over it.  I don't expect her to let her makeup lay around all over the freaking house so that everyone  picks it.  Oh, poor makeup.  I mean, it's not like I ask her to paint the house.  Yeah, just little chores you want her to do.  Right.  And I'd like her to be respectable, and I'd like her to get her work done, and I'd like  to get her grades up, and, oh, but that's, I'm ragging on her.  It sounds like normal mother stuff, but your daughter doesn't think it's normal, and she 
[00:51:30]  needs to get back at you by having sex with her father's best friend.  Wow.  So you tell her to pick up her makeup and her semen-stained clothes off the floor?  I mean...  Oh.  Hey, are you using birth control, Shannon?  Whatever your name is.  What is her name?  Ashley.  Ashley.  I looked up in the phone line.  Well, for some reason, no names are typed in on the fucking phone thing.  Because the computer's down.  And I told you that.  The computer's also for the phones? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Look at this fucking place.  Jesus Christ.  I'm calling her Bill, because I see her name Bill up on the screen.  What do I know?  How about you use your memory?  I'm in the moment.  I'm not thinking about fucking names.  I'm thinking about what I'm going to talk about.  This is one of the biggest freaking stories we've had in the first century.  And with all the horrors that we have on the show, have we used fake fucking names?  Am I supposed to remember goddamn aliases?  I want to ask a question.  Oh.  That's important.  I'm looking at instant feedback. 
[00:52:30]  Her name's Jim D.  It's Hey, Would You Blow Me on line five.  Who do I know?  Oh, you know you fucked your mother for a nickel.  We're going to play that in a minute.  I'm missing you.  You old rat bastard.  Ashley?  Ashley?  Yeah?  Do you like wiffle ball?  No.  No.  Would you be willing to come to New York?  Yeah.  You want to come visit us?  Maybe.  I don't like that.  How about a yes? 
[00:53:00]  I'd like to get a gander at you.  We'll put you up in a nice hotel.  Get an older gentleman to come in and have sex with you.  Oh, gosh.  No?  All right.  Well, Ashley, what do you want to say to your mom today?  I'm not going to stop doing it.  I don't care how mad you guys get, how worse it gets.  I'm not stopping.  She's loving this because she's winning.  She's winning.  I think she's loving it because she's...  If I could talk him into doing it, I'm definitely going to blow him over the radio. 
[00:53:30]  I don't get into what she says.  Wow, man.  Wow, she's finally getting the attention she wanted her whole life.  This is the attention.  It's good.  What's mom's name again?  Janice.  All right, Pat McGroin.  Janice.  Yes.  Are you all right?  No, I'm here.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I think you're going to have to give up on this one.  A lot of people are suggesting cool songs we could be playing in the background, but no, 
[00:54:00]  we can't.  Our computer's broken.  I thought the computer's back up.  It keeps turning on and off.  We could play Pink Floyd's mother.  Ashley, did you guys fool around after your dad spoke with Fred?  Yeah, it was about two hours afterwards.  I like this Fred.  This guy's got some gumption.  He's got a lot of spunk, and it's all in her.  Did he have any injuries?  Wait, wait.  No, you know what?  He mailed me real good doggy style, too. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, my God.  He took out his aggressions.  His dad took out on him.  He took it out on me.  I can't take this anymore.  You are so foul.  I can't believe you.  Took out the aggression.  Wow, that is really nasty.  Was he all cut up and banged up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You made him feel better, though, right?  What did he say when he was banging doggy style?  Well, he wasn't saying anything. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  He was moaning with pleasure and delight.  Wow.  Wow, there's nothing to say after that, huh, Mom?  Hey, Ashley, you haven't spoken to your father, have you?  No.  No.  Where is he right now?  Daddy, no, he's not home.  He went to work.  He works like he has been for the past 20 years of you being alive.  No.  Supporting.  He works to support that beautiful 19-year-old ass. 
[00:55:30]  That's right.  Who his friend is violating.  So she can buy her whore clothes.  Oh.  That's where his hard-earned money is going to.  You know what?  You can finish paying for school yourself.  I'm not paying for that either.  You put a roof over her head.  Go ahead.  Stop paying for college and see what I do.  I'll be really vindictive.  You know what?  I'm not paying for anything for you.  What could she possibly do?  I'm right in front of myself.  What are you going to do?  Give birth on the air for me?  You know, I don't care anymore.  What could you more do to me?  We tried to do that years ago, but it didn't work out. 
[00:56:00]  What else could you possibly do to me?  I'll screw them right in front of the house.  You know, people that I didn't even know knew right away who the hell we were.  I went to the supermarket yesterday.  Oh, my God.  The people look at me.  So you're going to screw them right in front of your mom now?  Yeah.  If she quits paying for college, I'm going to be an asshole.  Going to be an asshole.  When he starts.  You might want to give up that.  You took back about six years ago when you started.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  This is getting very uncomfortable.  So I don't know what to tell you, Janice.  No, I don't know.  All right.  I washed my hands of her.  Yeah.  I'm done.  All right.  And, Ashley, any final thoughts here?  No, I said if I could talk Fred into it, I'll call you back.  All right.  Oh, what a little slut.  Do you think Fred's wife is going to come and knock on the hotel door?  There's a whore in your hotel!  Oh, I'll bring her right to the hotel.  There's a whore in your building!  That's not what the police is going to do. 
[00:57:00]  I'll bring her right to the hotel.  She's so furious.  I hope she rips every strand of your hair out.  Mm.  All right.  All right.  I guess there's the update everyone was asking for today.  It hasn't gotten much better today, right, Ant?  No.  All right.  Well, Ashley, good luck to you.  Bye.  Thanks.  And, Janice, I don't know what to tell you.  What, what, Eric?  I'll put them on hold.  Can you do that?  Place them on hold?  Yeah, put them on hold.  Shut up.  Can you do that?  Or is the computer broken?  We can place them on hold. 
[00:57:30]  Place more gooder than...  How come there's no names up there for Anthony to look at?  I don't know.  It's a mess today.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  There goes the mom.  And, Ashley, thank you.  Let's go to Patio Furniture on line three, Opie.  All right, wow.  That situation's getting worse.  Son of a bitch!  That situation's getting worse, huh?  Yeah, it doesn't look very good over there. 
[00:58:00]  And, trust me, that's the real deal.  We know for sure, so.  She's a little twisted that she wants to do all this on the air, but who are we to say no?  I want to meet her.  Instant feedback from Middletown, how she could actually get more vindictive and cause her parents more hurt than what she's done.  She should blow a black guy on the air.  That's what our listener's saying, not me.  I just read it.  All right.  I do believe it's accurate, but...  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my God.  Why are we giving this bitch so much time on our show?  Oh, this is Ashley Part 28. 
[00:58:30]  I know.  It's coming up now.  Fucking police academies have more integrity than this bit run.  Call yet again.  Yeah, Ashley Part 4.  This is where there's a little twist involved, I believe.  A little twist, you guys.  Okay!  Ashley Part 4.  The Heretics.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Ah.  Ashley's back.  I defy the New York papers to give her the coverage you gave. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, and the papers have her as the youngest girl to ever bang her father's friend.  Ashley.  Yeah.  What's going on today?  I'm in my parents' house, and I'm up in their room on their bed, and I'm going to blow him  and make him, when he's ready to come, I want him to come all over their sheets, and then  we're going to leave.  Okay, hold on.  The guy is there with you?  Fred?  Yeah.  It took me a while to convince him to do it, but because my parents, usually on Fridays 
[00:59:30]  my dad doesn't work, we sat across the street and waited for them to leave.  They usually go grocery shopping afterwards.  So why are you whispering if they're not in the house?  I don't know.  I guess because I'm all freaked out on doing this.  See, we're not, I don't know if we're buying your story.  I know.  It gets bigger and bigger and worse and worse as it goes along, and, you know, it's so outrageous  that, you know, it leaves us to believe that perhaps it isn't really happening.  Let us talk to him. 
[01:00:00]  Hold on.  Yeah.  We don't have a cast, though.  Hey.  Yeah.  Who are you?  Fred.  What?  Fred.  Fred?  And you're the friend of the father?  Uh-huh.  And you've been having sex with this daughter?  Yeah.  What did the father do when he found out?  He'd shit out of me.  And how old are you?  38.  38, and you're banging your best friend's daughter? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  And her father's 38?  I think he's pushing 40.  Mm-hmm.  And, man, I just don't know if I'd buy this.  It's so outrageous that it's like, you want to believe it because it's so outrageous, but  then you kind of got to think, how can this possibly really be happening?  Hey, Fred, if she gives you a Hummer, will you promise not the sheets?  Will you arc one on the pillow?  I don't even know if I can get it off or not.  Oh, you don't even know if you can get it off? 
[01:01:00]  I can get it off.  Oh, get it off.  Now, wow, what's asked this guy?  How big is it?  What?  So you've been taking her to the hotel, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And giving her, is she hot?  Yes, she's hot.  Yeah.  So you've been looking at her for many years?  Uh, since she's about 16, I guess.  16?  Yeah.  Cool.  And how bad did he get beat up the other day?  I got a black eye, a fat lip.  What did he do?  Like, how did he, all of a sudden, you don't know what's happening, and you see the father, 
[01:01:30]  what, pull up?  Yeah, I didn't really think anything about it, and then he just busted in the door and  started beating the shit out of me.  So he came to your house, did he say anything?  Uh, just shit like, you know, what the hell are you doing with my daughter, and stuff  like that.  And what did you say?  I just kind of crouched on the couch, and tried to cover up the best I could.  And took it like a man, knowing what you were going to get later on that night from his  daughter, right?  Yeah.  So you like that hot piece of ass in front of you? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  A whole lot better than my wife.  Oh, yeah, your wife.  What happened to her?  She hasn't come home yet.  Where was she?  She's in St. Petersburg.  Man, everything, like, adds up.  They got the story together.  It's so cool.  They all had their story together.  It's like a little drama club.  Well, definitely, Anthony and I have talked about this thing that's been going on on  our show for the last few days, and we're just not sure what's real and what's not.  Because it's so out there.  It's one of those things.  I mean, everyone's facts are kind of lining up. 
[01:02:30]  They're really prepared if it isn't.  Yes, Sex Bagel.  Ask him, the hotel they were talking about last time, is it the one down the street or the  one near the mall?  Yeah.  What hotel was it at?  Was it the one down the street or the one near the mall?  The one up next to the mall.  Yeah, that's right.  The one next to the mall.  Would you guys be able to come in studio someday?  I don't want to see these two.  I can't wait to see these two.  They're the greatest two ever.  All right.  Well, so are you naked? 
[01:03:00]  Is she naked?  Yes, she is, but I just got my pants down.  I don't want to take my pants off or anything.  I'm going to get out of here if anything happens.  So why would you be talked into this?  I'm stupid.  Well, I'll give you that.  And why is it's Ashley, right?  Why is Ashley so upset with her parents that she would do this?  I don't know.  You don't know?  She never talks to you about it?  Nah, it's just the same old teenage stuff.  You know how they are.  Yeah.  Of course we do. 
[01:03:30]  Hell yeah.  Tight as a drum.  So what is Ashley doing now?  She's working on it.  She's working on your thing?  Uh-huh.  And what does she look like?  Long brown hair.  Blue eyes.  About five, five, two.  About 110 pounds, I guess.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Caught him.  What was that?  She said 108. 
[01:04:00]  I heard a baby in the background.  Yeah, what am I hearing in the background, sir?  Probably TV.  TV's still playing.  All right.  Is she working?  You good?  Yeah.  Let's get the phone to Ashley.  Hey, Ashley.  Hey.  So what are you doing?  I'm blowing them.  In your parents' bedroom?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, shit.  There's your mom.  Okay.  All right.  See, now I'm not buying it.  There it is. 
[01:04:30]  They went too far.  Shit, there's your mom.  No, fuck!  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Okay.  Let's just listen.  Yeah.  Fuck off my bed.  What the fuck is...  Those corn balls.  That was so bad.  Here's your mom.  Then he says again, here's your mom.  There's your mom.  I don't think they heard it.  There's your mom. 
[01:05:00]  I think we put an end to that stuff, finally.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  If you want me to be involved with the play, it's out of the question.  Out of the question.  Rachel, you sucked my cock and your mom walked in.  Your mom is back.  That was awful.  We wanted to believe it.  Yeah, but we...  A yes-sex bagel?  I just called the number back, the mom's phone number.  Yeah.  You just hear the phone come on.  You're like, ow, my hair.  You... 
[01:05:30]  And then it hangs up again.  So they're still playing the act out.  They're still acting.  Like, we're going to keep calling them over and over to see if this...  The beautiful thing is, though, and I'll credit myself, I didn't buy this from the first.  From the get-go.  Yep.  Yep.  It was one of those things.  This is a bunch of bunk.  Bunk.  It was one of those things that sounded fun.  You wanted to believe it.  But they really, like, their little acting crew there, they had their facts lined up.  They were good.  I didn't think it was real either.  It was one of those things, you know, it's kind of fun to listen to them making it up.  And that was kind of funny, too. 
[01:06:00]  Well, for a while there, we weren't sure.  Yeah, it was...  We've got to be honest.  And then we were...  And I were talking.  We're like, I don't know, man.  I was saying there was a little element of doubt.  That was the only thread holding it together.  But after that, I mean, come on.  That ends it right there.  That ends it.  You know what really rubbed me the wrong way?  And I noticed this immediately.  Is that these two are supposedly fighting on the phone, and yet they tolerated every idiotic thing we said.  Right, right.  The mother of you, you raised a slut.  Oh, a slut. 
[01:06:30]  I raised a slut, Mary.  Right now, what they're doing, they're all clasping hands and bowing.  They would...  Thank you.  Well, now they have to call back and tell us what that was all about.  Yeah, just call back.  We got the goof call back.  Yeah, we know you're kidding.  It was fun.  It was fun.  They put on a nice little show.  Absolutely.  It was like watching a miniseries.  It was a good three-day soap opera.  A vignette.  And you know what?  If you poll the audience, I think over 50% were buying this whole thing.  Until today. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, that was just awful.  That was a huge discussion on a lot of the message boards.  You guys are tools.  Why are we tools?  Why are we tools, stupid asses?  Ever say donkey sausage.  Why are we tools?  We said just before we went to the phone call or continue with the phone call that we  weren't sure we were buying it completely.  Look at this guy.  Too bad Dad didn't show up.  Yeah, that would have been hot.  Him and Fred could have got into it.  Damn, you think they could have at least gotten into the BJ a little more? 
[01:07:30]  That didn't sound as fake.  Yeah.  Listener theater of the mind equals awful radio.  If no one thought it was real, how did you confirm that this was a real story yesterday?  Good point.  Good point.  I think someone on this program did confirm it was a real story.  Someone did say they confirmed it and it's a real story.  I think he's got frosted hair.  Was it Sex Bagel that was confirming that this was real?  I think it was. 
[01:08:00]  Well, we tried to confirm it by acting like a lawyer and stuff.  Yeah, but they weren't going to fess up to anybody.  I'll bet you they were saying, did you believe that idiot acted like a lawyer and he thinks we bought it?  Oh, yes, for legal ramifications.  We knew you weren't a real lawyer.  Anthony didn't know any real legal terms.  Look, technically there can be jail.  Jail?  Well, Sex Bagel's working on him.  Technicalically?  Sex Bagel, I think, is working on him right now.  Not only that, the name of the lawyer that I used was Chuck Schick,  who was the lawyer in the law student in Caddyshack. 
[01:08:30]  Ah, that walked up, introduced you to,  Hey, I'd like you to meet Chuck Schick, he's going to law school.  That's zero.  Chuck Schick.  That's good.  I'll say.  Mick Cage's performance in Windtalkers was better than that awful acting.  Yeah, that was horrendous acting.  Oh, it's your mom.  Nothing.  It's your mom.  Yeah, I know, just perfect timing.  It's your mom.  No.  It's your mom.  When I give you the signal, we're going to yell, it's your mom. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  Oh, I got it.  Let's call up and we'll say that mom walked in.  You know, that's been bothering me for the last few days,  so I'm glad there's an ending to that.  But, God, I tell you one thing.  The only thing he almost tripped up what color her hair was, blonde, brown.  Blonde, blonde, brown.  Blonde, brown.  She was probably shaking her hair in front of him.  No, I mean, she couldn't have been.  I bet you they wrote stuff down because you think the age is right, everything right.  The hotel location.  Everything. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  I think Ashley's back on the line here.  She's laughing.  Ashley.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys got to, like, fess up now because we're on to you.  Okay.  You remember.  You remember all your stuff.  Look at them.  They're all little troupes.  Look at this.  It's a comedy troupes.  It's a comedy troupes.  It's the, we're an improv group.  It's the Upright Citizens Brigade, everybody.  Do you remember, do you remember on your second show that, the second week of your show on  Monday, a girl from Tennessee called and played with herself with that, with that high 
[01:10:00]  voltage vibrator because I had dirty dreams about you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm Nina from Tennessee.  Oh, okay.  And you, you actually emailed me a couple times, right?  Well, how about I drove to Hazleton so that Janice's number would register on your phone  line?  Are you crazy?  You know what, you're going to just, what, you're going to just forward it?  Yeah, we just totally wanted to mess with you guys.  We were giving you a little bit of your positive women's, um, promo.  You guys had a problem with the promo. 
[01:10:30]  All right, all right.  Let's, let's back up.  So you were the one from Tennessee that played with yourself, right?  Right.  So was that for real?  Yeah, it was, that was for real.  So you had a real orgasm on our show?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  So then you guys just.  This is just totally because we just wanted to give you a little bit of women's positive  promo.  Yeah, that's positive.  All right.  All right.  So, Ashley, how old are you?  I'm, I told you, I'm 32.  You're 32 and you're acting like a teenager?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And how about Janice?  My mother?  Is 31.  Is 31.  The mom, oh, oh, I can't believe, she's, hey, did you, did you write stuff down? 
[01:11:00]  No, I swear to God, we didn't write a, nothing down.  Nothing down.  All improv.  Yeah, all improv.  Improv.  And we did it over the phone.  I was calling you guys from my Tennessee number.  She was, and when you guys were calling her, it was from her Pennsylvania number.  Man.  And we were just communicating back and forth by phone.  And then Fred was actually my husband that you were talking to.  Yeah, Fred, Fred ruined it.  Fred's going to do true or false. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, Fred's acting stunk.  They want to try and trap you, so they don't ever give you true or false.  I got to tell you, you know, there was a point I was believing it for a while.  I think there was a point Anthony was for a little bit.  I'm always completely skeptical.  So there was that element of doubt the whole time, and I'm always fishing around trying to  find out.  I wanted to believe it.  Oh, hell yeah.  And then I got to tell you, the listeners, they're being honest on the instant feedback,  and it's split right down the middle, right?  It was always split 50-50.  We love your show, and the shit that you say about women isn't bad. 
[01:12:00]  I mean, hell.  I know.  And what did you think of Anthony's lawyer impression?  I knew it was a crock of shit.  Of course you did.  Damn it.  Yeah, I played right into it.  Stupid Chuck Schick.  Yeah.  Chuck ruined the program.  I'm going to give you to Janice.  She wants to talk to you for a couple minutes.  I love you guys.  Norton, you're a sweetheart, and I'll talk to you later.  Okay, thank you, miss.  Hello, this is Mom.  Hey, Janice, how are you?  Good, how are you?  You guys were pretty good, I got to tell you. 
[01:12:30]  Were we?  The first two days, we kind of wanted to go over the top today so that everybody really  knew.  Yeah, there you go.  No, you're saying that now because it went horribly wrong.  The timing was awful.  Oh, well, we didn't, like we said, we didn't have anything planned.  But it was, you know, three days of fun, you know?  Yeah, well, we just figured, you know, maybe you can get something you could use for a positive  promo.  That was great.  We enjoyed that.  And as far as you're not having women listeners, you obviously know you do.  Well, can you guys make it up to us now and dyke out or something? 
[01:13:00]  Dyke out, Opie.  Or have Ashley get banged live on the show?  I think you've got to make it up to us now.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, we'll have to do that.  All right.  You know what was a little confusing for me?  We played a Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail, our old CD.  Oh, no, that CD never came out.  That's right.  Well, it's out there, though, and thousands of people are enjoying it, thanks to file sharing  and oavirus.com.  But then Ashley called up, decided this is my opportunity, and said, I want to do one 
[01:13:30]  of those.  And that's why I was like, well, if it was something planned, you know, the timing, you  know what I mean?  I know, yeah, yeah.  The timing was too good.  Yeah, well, we tried to make it sound a little more real, but, you know, we're not professional,  so.  You guys at least made it seem professional.  That Fred, that's the worst acting I've ever heard.  I know.  Fred was horrible.  Yeah, we hated Fred.  He made Voss seem like John Gielgud.  Wow, nice.  Good reference.  All right, guys. 
[01:14:00]  Okay.  But we love you, and we're going to continue listening to you.  We think you guys rock.  Thank you.  Okay.  Stay away from the pranks, or people are going to start thinking we're doing fake radio.  Okay, no, no, no, no.  And tell Ashley she's got a bang now, live on the show.  Okay, we will.  All right.  Okay.  Oh.  There it is.  Oh, you're going to get it.  Hey, dude, let me tell you, these chicks were real.  Hey, it's Rockhole.  What's going on?  Me and Dave are calling these chicks again.  Ugh. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, all right.  That was fun.  We fessed up to it.  Cool.  It was fun to listen to it for a little while.  Where's the promos about us celebrating the female?  Nice, young, fresh vagina.  Fresh vagina.  Fresh vagina.  Fresh vagina. 
[01:15:00]  You're the Anthony Show.  Yes, you did a good job on that promo.  Promo.  Promo.  XM202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Oh, God.  Remember when Henry Rollins called the show?  Yeah, boy, he schooled us.  He's a very interesting fellow.  And I like talking to him on this program.  But sometimes he just gets a bit of an attitude.  He gets a bit of a toot going.  And he goes on and on.  Like he's a little too hip for the room.  He's one of these guys that he deals with a bunch of other musicians who are like,  Whoa, that guy, man.  He really, I tell you, he doesn't take anything at face value. 
[01:15:30]  And it's like, dude, please.  We talk about shit all the time.  I'm not impressed with any of your observations.  They're amusing, fine.  He lives a very different life than you and I.  I love this next segment because...  He's gay?  Huh?  You're saying he's gay?  No, he's saying he's not.  No.  Very different.  No, I get a big laugh.  Wow.  No, Jimmy.  That was very well-timed.  That's awful.  I'll put my headphones on.  I love Jim Norton in this next segment because...  I love him always.  No, I just liked him in this segment because Henry had something to say about Richard Pryor 
[01:16:00]  and basically was saying that we just didn't know anything about Richard Pryor.  Yeah, he was listening to Richard Pryor since I was eight.  Someone gets schooled in this, too.  That's right.  Yeah, well, you'll hear it.  Just believe me, this isn't a tease.  No, I really like it because you shove it right back in his face.  That's what I love about this bit.  So listen to that.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  And on the phone right now, we've got to say hi to an old friend. 
[01:16:30]  We haven't talked to him in a while.  It's Henry Rollins.  Henry.  How you doing, man?  Henry.  What's going on today, buddy?  Not much.  It's six in the morning where I am.  Oh, you're in L.A., obviously, no?  Yeah.  Are you at your apartment or house?  Not at the office.  Oh, because I asked that because I think I remember last time we talked to you that you  don't really have a place of residence, really.  Yeah, I do.  I'm just not around much.  It's kind of like a place just to put your stuff as you travel the world, right? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I try and stay out as much as possible.  I just got back from Europe, and I'm heading off to Russia in about 10 days.  What are you going to do in Russia?  I'm going to go into Siberia, and I'm going to go on the Trans-Siberian Rail, which is  the 6,000-mile train ride.  Why are you doing that?  I think it would be interesting, and it might make for some interesting writing, and seeing  Siberia at the coldest part of the year might be something that might be memorable.  It might be a total drag. 
[01:17:30]  I don't know.  How long of a trip is it?  It's a week.  Okay, a week.  And they do this regularly, or...?  Yeah, that thing runs all year, yeah.  There's three different rail systems.  There's the Trans-Siberian, Trans-Mongolian, and something else, but this is the big one,  so I figured...  I was in Sweden the other night, and I said, now's the time, so I researched it, called  up the travel agent, and who I wear out on a regular basis for these ideas, and she got  on it.  That isn't one of those things where people kind of have made it almost touristy. 
[01:18:00]  Is it still, like, pretty harsh?  What kind of travel, I don't know, a countryman's...  Well, there's either two to a car or four to a car, you know, a train car, so you just  decide how many people you want to travel with.  And the train lets you off, you know, every few hours for a while to go check out a different  town.  And I know a girl years ago who did it said it was really amazing, so it got me really  curious.  Well, what are you going to see in these towns?  Well, the locals, and probably a lot of snow and ice. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  I mean, it sounds kind of interesting, but you're going to be looking out the window,  seeing the exact same thing for a week straight, no?  Yeah, but, you know, so do you on your way to work.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, you got me.  Well, no, no, and so do I when I'm here.  So, you know, what I'm saying is that's why I like to get out and see a different, you  know, just nine to five.  You know, it's funny, a friend of mine went to Russia one time, and we were talking about  it, and he said that some places are nice, but some places have, like, real poverty. 
[01:19:00]  And I'm like, did you notice that?  And he's like, absolutely.  Oh, yeah, no, Russia, I've been there four times.  Russia has a lot of problems.  Yeah.  And the people are fantastic, and Stalin really did, and Stalin and communism really messed  that country up.  If you didn't like communism, you come out of Russia going like, yep, definitely a bad idea.  But why would you live in that area now, now that Russia's trying to, like, move forward  into the... 
[01:19:30]  Well, there's opportunity if, you know, you have the keys to the kingdom.  A lot of tough guys, a lot of criminal types made a lot of money when the wall came down,  just because there's a lot of military people willing to sell pretty much anything.  And people were buying everything from submarines to every weapon known to man.  And that's a lot of weapons that we're getting hit by in Iraq are, you know, Russian-made, you  know, Kalashnikovs.  When I was in Iraq a few months ago, I saw this newly captured cache of weapons that they 
[01:20:00]  pulled off out of Syria, I guess, or they came over the Syrian border.  And it's all brand new Russian gear, like, still packed in Greece.  Wow.  I know a guy who was...  He served over in Iraq.  He was over in...  Actually, I think in Baghdad and in Fallujah.  And he came back, and I'm like, well, I mean, how was it?  And he's like, it was really dangerous.  And I'm like, it was?  And he's like, you bet.  Yeah.  I was there in May, and I was in a mortar attack at one base, which was a pretty dramatic 
[01:20:30]  deal.  Oh, you went over there?  Yeah.  I do a trip for the USO every three months, and been to Afghanistan a couple of times,  Kyrgyzstan a couple of times, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Iraq, Kuwait, Honduras, places like  that.  What's your take on the whole thing?  Well, my take is, are men and women in the military the best in the world?  And I'm devoted to them.  I think Iraq, the president's saying one thing, but they're actually going after something 
[01:21:00]  else.  It's not really spreading freedom as much as it's putting in a roadblock against what  they think is the rising Arab unified world or something.  Is that a bad thing, in your opinion?  Um, it's, it's a bad thing when you kind of cram democracy down someone's throat.  Right.  Uh, it's a very bad thing when 1,500 of my countrymen come back dead, and thousands and  thousands come back, legs gone, faces gone, and I'll be visiting some of them on February 
[01:21:30]  12th at Walter Reed Army Hospital.  So, uh, in my opinion, uh, the freedom of all of Iraq is not worth a scraped knee of  an American soldier.  I've got to agree with you there.  Yeah, I agree too.  I've got to agree with you on that one.  I, I have a lot of problems about this conflict.  I think if they were, uh, uh, uh, before we even gave them a second thought, I think if  they really, the people really wanted freedom and were rising up and making a concerted effort 
[01:22:00]  amongst themselves to be free and asked for the, uh, uh, uh, United States' assistance,  I think that's a different story.  My thoughts exactly.  I think they were like.  If you weren't man enough to take the guy out, then maybe you just like it that way.  There you go.  And then if they needed help to attain this freedom that they all dreamt about, then  that's a different story.  But I think the fact is they were sheep, uh, being led by, uh, a dictator with an iron fist  that, uh, you know, perhaps they didn't really want freedom.  So why should we, uh, risk American lives to give them something they don't even understand? 
[01:22:30]  I'm all into freedom and democracy and no one likes Saddam Hussein.  I mean, he's a creep, but that being said, I just see all these people coming home in  bags and that's just not worth it to me.  Especially when you meet these guys.  They're just, you know, they're just people like you and me with this completely surreal  job.  I mean, the, the, they're nine to five over there.  It just, it's just not, you're not able to believe what they go through.  Nope.  That's why they're so screwed up when they get back too, you know, having to deal with 
[01:23:00]  that.  Forget about it.  Jay, one of that Siberian thing, like the bipolar express that show, that movie.  Uh, the bipolar express.  Well, it'll be bipolar when I get on it, my friend.  Okay.  I just had to break that up.  All right.  Thanks.  Uh, Henry, one other thing about Iraq.  Is it as crazy as, uh, they're showing it is on the news?  Yeah.  I mean, um, as soon as the sun goes down, you hear gunfire all night and, uh, wherever  you go, you're in an, uh, you know, armor plated Humvee surrounded by armed men and nowhere's 
[01:23:30]  really safe.  The green zone isn't safe.  I mean, every, you know, you're kind of up for grabs wherever you are there.  And the tension is pretty grim.  I mean, people are dead serious.  Like when you're out moving around, there's no, there's no joking around.  Yeah.  Like when you're in a black Hawk, you're followed by a guard black Hawk.  I mean, cause these guys are getting shot at.  They're getting mortared all the time.  There's a lot of the, the improvised explosive devices are very effective, you know, and, uh, 
[01:24:00]  the Kevlar vests, the, the ceramic, uh, plated body armor is really effective, but the  arms keep coming off.  That's our problem.  We, the guts remain intact with the arms go flying into the air.  So it's a, it's a mess.  Um, and what about the people?  Are they, uh, do they feel safer?  Are you seeing that or no?  Or, or are they pretty scared too?  They wouldn't let me near anybody.  I'll tell you what though, when I was flying up from Kuwait, I was up front of the C-130  with the pilots and they said, see all those lights down there? 
[01:24:30]  I said, yeah.  And they said, none of that was happening when we got here.  So they, we built all of that.  There's like, uh, apparently a, a, a huge percent more electricity in Iraq than before we were  there.  It doesn't mean we necessarily, that's our job to go turn on the lights for people, but  it just shows you that when America, we're the first people you want to have help you  because we get it done.  Um, and I've seen a lot of humanitarian aid in every one of these places I've been to  in, in Afghanistan and, and even in, in, uh, in, uh, Honduras when I was there last summer. 
[01:25:00]  What do you, uh, got going?  What's this shock and awe DVD thing you got?  Uh, that's, uh, it comes out like any minute now.  It's, um, from last year's tour, shot it, uh, in Seattle on show 51 of the tour.  And it's just a document of last year's tour.  It's just me on stage on my own talking, uh, telling stories about, you know, where I just  been and those shows I've been doing for about 22 years.  And now once the tour, we, we make a DVD now. 
[01:25:30]  See, that's why he goes to these places.  He gets all this info.  He goes on stage and talks about it.  Yeah.  It's, uh, you're more, uh, spoken word, right?  Although there's, um, there's definitely a lot of comedy in, in what you do.  Oh yeah, sure.  I mean, there's a lot of funny stuff.  I mean, um, you don't want to, you don't want to, uh, commit to the comedy thing officially  or what?  Well, like as a stand-up?  Yeah, why not?  And have to tell dog jokes and stupid non-sequiturs, but like, you know, but I like my wife, though,  and all that kind of corny crap.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't have to be a bad stand-up.  You can just tell, you can be a good stand-up. 
[01:26:00]  Richard Pryor didn't exactly do dog jokes and bad non-sequiturs.  He also spoke the truth and talked about his life, and then he did stand-up.  Yeah, Bill Hicks had a point of view with his comedy, whether you agree or disagree.  And they're great, but, um, uh, and I've been, I've been checking out  Richard Pryor when you guys were, like, minus eight years old, but, um, and I, you know,  those guys are heroes to me.  I just don't want to be in a comedy club being on the comedy circuit, and when I want to talk  about homophobia or something that's serious and have some guy throw his drink at me. 
[01:26:30]  Well, you don't worry about the reaction, though.  You have to go home without an ear, so that's the problem there.  If you're talking about, there's definitely a risk in a comedy club, um, because you also  have to take what it is and express it and somehow find humor in the situation.  Absolutely.  I respect comics.  If someone said, go do an hour at a comedy club tonight, I'd be terrified.  And I was a homophobic child, and in kindergarten, I wouldn't even skip to my Lou.  And how much do you make a week doing stand-up?  Not much. 
[01:27:00]  Well, we have Jay London.  Well, keep working at it, because it sounds like it's working for you.  I mean, if that's your, if you walk on stage and that's your first line, I think you're  going to be eating tuna casserole for a long time.  Well, actually, you still live with Mom, or are you moving out now?  Are you thinking about it?  Actually, we have Jay London in the studio.  He's, uh, he was on Last Comic Standing.  Uh, very funny comic, actually.  He's playing Caroline's this weekend.  Then we got Jim Norton, who does the radio show with us, who's, uh, very funny.  Last Comic, what was that, Comedy Central?  Uh, Last Comic Standing was on NBC.  NBC, yeah.  NBC. 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  Yeah, so.  Yeah.  Uh, well, you've been all over the world.  Where's your favorite place to go?  Well, besides America, I like Australia.  Why Australia?  Just an amazing country.  People are very friendly.  It's very beautiful.  Food's good.  The women are beautiful.  Uh, it's very clean.  It takes a while to get there.  Aren't they a little uptight about content?  Once you get off the plane.  Aren't they a little uptight about content?  They seem to be a bit more uptight than, uh, Americans as far as, like, you know, us,  content is concerned. 
[01:28:00]  Well, there's elements of, of Australia that are very conservative, like here or anywhere else,  but the people are, uh, pretty fun-loving as far as, uh, I've been there 26 times, and,  uh, they, I don't know, they like the hard rock, and, uh, they come, they come to the  talking shows, and they seem to be pretty straight-up people.  Yeah.  Uh, advice to, uh, to the average man, if, uh, they could only take one trip, where would  you, uh, suggest they go?  Gee.  For, like, kind of, you know, kind of a, um, a fun vacation, you know, I mean, not, obviously 
[01:28:30]  not the Caribbean, you know, maybe somewhere where you would never think to go.  Get an adventure.  Yeah, maybe an adventure vacation.  Uh, Egypt is pretty cool as far as, like, some jaws-dropping stuff to see, you know,  as far as being a tourist, you, everywhere you look, it's kind of mind-blowing.  I wanted to go to Egypt, but then they were saying that, uh, it's, it's very, very dangerous  now.  Yeah.  Ever since 2000, ever since the, uh...  People were hacked up at that one tourist site.  I forget where that was. 
[01:29:00]  I tried to go right after that, but my manager talked me out of it.  But wherever you go now, like, when you, you're, you're at, uh, the Valley of the Kings,  or, or the, you know, the, the Giza pyramids, there is, uh, uh, a bunch of young men  with Uzis guarding you, because that is their, their business, is tourism.  So you're, you're very protected.  Okay.  What was the, uh, there was one spoken word thing you did I caught part of.  What was the part where you were talking about, something about being, like, vomiting, and,  like, being, like, drunk and sick, puking in the toilet or something like that? 
[01:29:30]  I, I, it's been a while, and I honestly don't remember it.  No, I, I've been drunk about three times in my life.  I probably threw up when I was 17 from alcohol, but, um, I was kind of like the three Michelob.  I don't like it anymore, kind of guy.  So I don't know if I got any, uh, puke and drunk.  Wasn't it, no, maybe it was you, you were sick.  I remember something in one of your spoken word things about being sick and being wrapped  around a toilet.  Oh, I was probably, uh, at one point, um, I, I probably, usually about once a year, I 
[01:30:00]  just, my body kind of gives out, and I just shake, rattle, and roll for about 24 hours  and puke and sweat.  And that was in Sweden a couple of years ago, where I, uh, where I told a story about the article  I read in the, uh, in the newspaper about a man who sued Starbucks because he apparently  crushed his penis inside one of the men's room toilets.  And I think that was bundled up in the same story as, uh, hugging the toilet in Sweden,  because I, I think in my, in my vomitous reverie, I tried to actually recreate the accident to 
[01:30:30]  see how he, he could be litigious, and, and I couldn't do it.  But I guess I'm just not that well gifted.  Yeah, the toilet seat slipped to the side and squished his nutsack between the, uh, toilet  and the seat.  That's classic.  I mean, you know what, you can go online and, and actually find a, a lot of the legal paperwork  on that.  Some girl sent it to me.  It's pretty great.  That's good reading.  Well, you know, it's interesting if you don't have a whole lot going on.  All right.  Let's, uh, let's say hi to Brad in Nashville.  Brad, what's up? 
[01:31:00]  How's it going, guys?  We got Henry Rollins on the phone.  Henry Rollins, you were listening to Richard Pryor when we were like minus eight years  old.  How cool are you?  That nigger's crazy.  Like my mom gave it to me when I was like eight or something.  And, um, my mom was pretty progressive.  And I remember I, I went to go see that, that performance film that was basically, uh, you  know, where that album came from.  And I remember walking out of there, uh, which one came, which one came from, uh, that nigger's  crazy.  Um, a lot of that stuff. 
[01:31:30]  Um, just a lot of the, um, the stuff from that Live at Sunset strip, just like that,  that, all that classic stuff, what, you know, um, that, um, all American nigger, that nigger's  crazy, a lot of that.  Bicentennial nigger, you mean?  Huh?  Bicentennial nigger.  Bicentennial nigger.  Not all American nigger, yeah.  Oh, no, no, I know you're saying the Live in Concert, which was filmed in Long Beach  in 1979, was, uh, taken from Wanted, which was, uh, Bicentennial, uh, that nigger's  crazy, it was kind of, uh, 1971 in the improv in New York City.  He filmed something called Richard Pryor, Live and Smoking.  A lot of that material eventually made its way onto that nigger's crazy, but, um, it 
[01:32:00]  actually, not the reverse, it was true.  The CD, the tape came out years after it was actually filmed, but it came out better.  It was actually better once it was on tape than it was in the original film, which bombed.  It wasn't released until 81, uh, by Blum Productions, because Pryor was already a star  by then.  Yeah.  Well, I, I, I saw it in D.C. when I was in high school.  Henry, um, you, you know what just went on, right?  Huh?  You know what just went on?  I think you insult, uh, like, Jim Norton is probably the biggest Richard Pryor fan ever, 
[01:32:30]  and when you said that you were listening to Richard Pryor albums when we were minus  eight years old, I think it really got to him.  Oh, really?  Did I insult the guy?  No, not at all.  I just, I felt, I felt it was a bit pretentious, but no, it wasn't insulting.  No, I, I, I just, you know, I, I, I just, I'm just saying, I'm down with comics, respect  comics, Lenny Bruce, I was listening to the records before I even understood what the hell  he was talking about, and then I got older and I kind of started getting to it, but all  that stuff, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, these guys were huge to me, so I'm 
[01:33:00]  not, what I'm trying to say is I, I'm not in any way disrespecting comics or comedy just  because I don't go and do a thing at the comedy club, it's, it's these guys, you know,  Lenny Bruce died for a lot of our, you know, our constitutional rights in my opinion, and  Bill Hicks was of the strength where his, such an early death seems to me, it almost smacks  of conspiracy, he was that effective to me, where you can almost buy the conspiracy idea 
[01:33:30]  that someone just wanted to shut him up for good, so all I was saying is I respect these  guys, if I, if I rubbed you the wrong way, man, I'm, I'm really, uh, well, I guess I  rubbed you the wrong way.  No, no, it was just, it was only when I, when I mentioned comedy, I stand up and you're  like, oh, should I do some, like, dog jokes, so it was kind of like, I figured that was  kind of a jab at comics that I mentioned prior.  Yeah, I just, I would hate to be put in that box where, like, one, two, three, make them 
[01:34:00]  laugh.  Like, one time I had to do, like, a five minute thing on, like, I don't know, uh, Penn and  tell her, they said, go out there and do five minutes.  I want, I don't know what you're, you're talking, I was terrified.  I said, can I do an hour?  You know, can I just be myself?  And they went, no, it's, come on, it's a show, go out there and, you know, those guys  can do it.  I, I did it, but it felt like I was a dog wearing a hat at a party.  I just felt really canned and, you know, kind of put up there.  I really like the smoke and work thing.  I got a lot of your, uh, your stuff and, uh, I enjoy it. 
[01:34:30]  I mean, I just would rather not have the pressure of, you know, seven seconds, bang, seven  seconds, bang.  You know, I'd rather, because a lot of stories I tell, they're, they're not funny.  I mean.  I'm a big fan of storytelling in general.  Like, when Richard Pryor used to tell his stories and, uh, uh, Jim Brewer, he's been on  our show a lot.  I like his storytelling.  I like.  What do you know about Richard Pryor, Opie?  Huh?  What do you know about Pryor?  Shut up.  Well, uh, back in 19...  No, I just, uh, I'm, I'm just a fan of the storytelling comics, you know, where it's, 
[01:35:00]  it's, uh...  Yeah, the anecdotal stuff to me was always the best.  Like, all those old Warner Brothers records of Bill Cosby, like Revenge and all those,  I, I got from my stepbrother.  He gave them to me when I was like six or seven.  And I thought Bill Cosby just made kids records.  I thought they were just for, you know, like an afternoon special thing.  And, like, that Revenge album, I, you know, I, I think I had a, a freaking seizure when  I first heard that.  Yeah.  It was, like, the funniest thing I'd ever heard in my life. 
[01:35:30]  Cosby, Cosby's a great comedian.  Like, I, I'm not a fan of his, but I do respect him as a comic and I acknowledge how great he  is.  My only problem with Cosby is when you take, like, you mentioned Lenny or Pryor or, or  Carlin, these guys express opinions and kind of speak through their work.  And it kind of bugs me that Cosby doesn't do that.  Yeah, Cosby was safe.  You know, he did clean humor that could be on Carson or could be in, you know, at a bar mitzvah.  But, but he had great mic technique, the way he would overload the diaphragm to make the  voices go low.  And, um, then, then you hear what, what Lenny Bruce is doing at the same, you know, like 
[01:36:00]  when he was, you know, towards the end of his life.  And it's just, you know, take the paint right off your car.  You know, the, the truth, this guy's dropping, like all the, you know, the, the, the recording  Zappa made at Berkeley is just insane.  All the Phil Spector stuff.  Um, I just got that box set that Wilner put together.  I haven't had a chance to hear it yet.  My problem with Cosby is like, I, I, again, it's like, but now he comes out and says all  this stuff like about the black community, which is fine.  But it's like, now he comes out and he goes, well, I just want to say this.  He's like, well, that's your job as a comedian for the last 35 years. 
[01:36:30]  You should have been saying it on stage as a comic.  What, you know, why would you do one type of an act, which is supposed to be truthful  and based on your perceptions.  And yet now this is the way you really, you know what I mean?  That's what kind of bugs me is the inconsider.  Yeah.  Well, I find him, uh, really uninteresting.  I mean, he's, he's became like, to me, just a kind of a, a, a grouch to where I think  his positions are just like kind of curmudgeonly and, and, you know, not moving.  And, and other comics around them were taking chances, you know, when he was doing all that 
[01:37:00]  early stuff, like, you know, to Russell, my brother whom I slept with and all that stuff.  Uh, to me, that's really safe comedy.  Then, then you see Carlin just come, you know, ripping out of the, the, the box with, you  know, class clown, AM, FM, occupation fool.  We're like, whoa, you know, that was heavy stuff.  I had those records on it in third and fourth grade and I memorized them at one point.  Do you like, like, I'm a big Carlin fan.  Like, I actually, a lot of people disagree with me on this one.  I happen to love progressively what he's done more and more. 
[01:37:30]  He's kind of lost his mind in the last 10 years, but I love that.  Man, I, I, I can dig it.  Do you like him better in the seventies or now?  The one tour he did, uh, that you, you're all infected, the one right after his wife  died, he was in a lot of pain and that material is just, you know, he was just like eviscerating  the audience.  It was kind of hard to get through because you can tell the guy is dealing with his wife  while he's on stage.  But, um, I really liked the fact that he's so furious.  I met him a while ago.  He was really cool to me and it meant a lot just because, you know, 
[01:38:00]  I just, I remember him from laughing.  Henry, we don't get excited too many times in the show, but we had George Carlin on the  air.  We were out of our minds that day.  He's a classic.  You know, I, I asked him that story.  I said, is it true that you were arrested with Lenny Bruce, uh, that night, you know,  when they were just hassling Lenny and just busting everyone at his shows for whatever  they could to make going to see Lenny Bruce kind of not the thing to do.  And he said, yeah.  And I said, is that how you met?  And he said, no, that Lenny hung out with all the young comics and he would let you do 
[01:38:30]  your routines in front of them and he would give you tips.  So he said, Bruce was really generous with his time with all the young guys, but he said  he was indeed cuffed with Lenny.  But like in that book, ladies and gentlemen, Lenny Bruce, they talk about it.  And I met him at MTV a few years ago and I said, you know, I have to know.  And he said, yeah, that happened.  Wow.  How many people know that?  That's not a myth.  You know, I mean, what a, what a night of your life, you know, to be cuffed with Lenny  Bruce, forget it. 
[01:39:00]  Henry, um, Andrew Dice Clay, genius.  I like, you know, I'd never heard him before.  And then Rick Rubin, you know, put out all those records that you've never heard Clay.  I went, no.  And he, he gave me all his records like in one chunk.  Yeah.  And I kind of just powered through all of them in a weekend.  And what's that, the day the laughter died?  Is that the, that's my favorite one.  Yeah.  That's Rick Rubin, I think produced.  Why does everyone talk about this CD?  Norton has been trying to get me to listen to this for a long time.  Oh, I think that album is amazing.  It's his best one.  Why is it amazing in your opinion? 
[01:39:30]  Because he's so brutal and you hear him go in and out of character.  He actually, you know, apparently he's a really nice guy and he's, it's an act.  And so every once in a while he'll say something so crass, you can hear his voice change  as he laughs at Andrew Dice Clay.  Yeah.  What's the background of that album again?  It was at Dangerfields here in New York.  He shot, what happened was he was, I think he was like the biggest comic on the planet  at that point.  He wanted to just walk into a place unannounced.  He walked into Dangerfields right around Christmas time and did like three or four hours, two  nights in a row, completely unannounced and horrified the audience with no prepared material. 
[01:40:00]  And no one was there either, right?  And 30 people were leaving.  Oh yeah.  And like, you know, some lady goes to the ladies room.  He starts talking about her.  She comes back.  Everyone's, oh man.  And you hear people like, this is horrible.  And he's like, yeah, just tells them where to go.  And the guy stands up, you stink.  That's my favorite moment on the thing.  This guy goes, you stink.  You're as funny as a bottle of milk.  And him and his wife walk out.  That's my favorite comedy moment ever.  I got it.  It's rough stuff, but I don't know. 
[01:40:30]  It's kind of the job of comedy in a way.  I mean, that's my favorite record of all of them.  But I think I've never really seen the guy perform.  I saw one HBO special like a couple of years ago when he was talking about his kids and he  wouldn't like the cigarette when he was on stage because he doesn't smoke anymore.  And it seemed a little restrained.  But I don't know.  I thought the records were fun.  We'll put it this way.  Anyone who gets offended by it, you're not really getting what the guy's putting out. 
[01:41:00]  I don't think he's trying to offend you.  After I heard the records, I'm like, people are up in arms about this?  Come on.  Yeah.  Hey, one question.  I'm a big Aussie freak, man.  Did you write stuff with Aussie or collaborate with Aussie?  No.  Just did some shows with him.  I've interviewed him a bunch of times.  I don't know.  Hung out with him a lot.  And he's an incredibly wonderful guy.  He's completely honest. 
[01:41:30]  He's a good man.  I've known him, I don't know, 10 or 11 years or so.  And he's just a cool dude who loves to perform.  That's why he doesn't retire.  Because he goes home and he just wants to go back out and play again.  All right.  Let me go to Eric in Kansas and then we'll wrap this up.  Eric, go ahead.  Hey, Henry.  Yes, sir.  I wanted to thank you for all the great music that you've put out  and the great advice that you gave on one of your CDs where you said, 
[01:42:00]  hold on to your depression because it keeps you grounded  and you're more clear-headed when you're depressed.  I just wanted to say to you that you're just totally awesome.  Well, thanks.  Yeah, it's...  What do you mean hold on to your depression?  Well, basically I wouldn't...  I would hope that you don't walk around depressed all the time, of course,  but so many, you know, unless it's a chronic condition  like we have to medicate or jump off a bridge,  there's a lot of things to be explored in depression 
[01:42:30]  where you get driven to such a point where there's no fake in it  and there's a lot of reality to be checked where most people pull back.  It's the door you can walk in.  If it leads to self-destruction, of course, that's no good.  But I would, days I wake up depressed, I don't recoil.  I just kind of go, okay, let's see how this feels.  And I kind of walk through it for a while,  actually learn a lot about myself and things like that.  It's like when you're, if you're working out 
[01:43:00]  and you've got like two more reps in you, but you do five,  it's those last three where you learn, you know, that's the workout.  So I'm not saying go out and get depressed,  but there's things to be learned when you're that messed up.  And you should understand it a little bit, too, because it's...  I would rather deal with it than go get drunk.  Right, right.  You know, that's what I'm saying.  I'm not, you know, if someone's so depressed they're going to die,  maybe they need to see a doctor, but...  No, man, when I get depressed or down, I just kind of ride it out, you know,  and I understand it. 
[01:43:30]  And also, you know, there's good,  there's a lot of humor in there as well.  Yeah, I'm held, yeah.  I mean, there's, you know, and all your great comics are, you know,  a lot of them are basket cases, you know,  because it's those vicissitudes that make that...  We get some funny stuff from the extreme edges, I think.  Yeah, all right.  My girlfriend bought me a down jacket  because she said it fit my personality.  That's Jay London, Harry.  He's on the other side of the spectrum from what you do,  and people enjoy him, too, though, 
[01:44:00]  and there's a place for him in this world as well,  and...  Yes, there it is.  All right.  Very good, Jay.  Thank you.  Henry.  Yes, sir.  It's always a pleasure.  So, shock and awe, the DVD is going to be released February 15th?  Something like that, yeah.  And also, you do the Henry's Film Corner, right?  Yeah, it's a show I have on the Independent Film Channel.  Do you just show your favorite films or something?  Well, we talk about...  I bring in, you know, cool guests.  We're going to...  This month on the show is Daryl Hannah, 
[01:44:30]  and I find her interesting just because she made the leap  from big screen to independent screen,  and she's actually doing really cool, really edgy stuff  with people like John Sayles.  And she also knows how to take a punch.  Uh, yeah.  I guess she still has some glove marks  from where Jackson Brown was just warming up in the bullpen.  Oh, my God.  Do you think, like, I like Daryl Hannah,  but do you think going from big screen to independent  is a leap or it's more like a tumble?  It's not like an upward mobility thing.  Well, you know, I asked her, I said,  you know, you were such the face, like, in the 80s, 
[01:45:00]  with Splash and all this stuff.  Wall Street.  And she said, yeah, it was, like, really nice.  There was, like, big paydays.  But she said, you didn't get any acting done.  And I said, okay.  And she said, now I get to act.  And I think it's a somewhat luxurious position  to already have a few million in the bank  to be able to go make relatively way less money  in the independent world.  But that being said, you know,  she's rocking the Tarantino thing,  this Silver City, the John Sayles film she was just in. 
[01:45:30]  John Sayles is, you know,  actors break their legs trying to get in his movies.  He's a really, you know, high-fiber, high-calorie guy.  And she's great in Silver City.  She's, like, really edgy and completely nails it.  And so I just think it's interesting  that she's prospering in the independent world  and she's happier because she's getting to act.  And so she struck me as a really cool person.  I didn't know what to expect,  and she was really cool, good interview. 
[01:46:00]  But that's kind of where the show is at.  We interview people.  We talk about kind of edgy and independent films, documentaries,  and we leave the big Jennifer Lopez films  for, like, the big stations to talk about.  I don't know.  That Jersey girl, though, with Jennifer Lopez and Affleck,  I think that was a really good one, though,  because I didn't know what was going to happen at the end.  Henry, we're going to let you go.  Okay.  We would love to maybe get you on the phone after the Siberia trip, man,  because I'm sure you'll have a story or two to tell.  Yeah.  I sat in the restaurant car with a man I couldn't understand, 
[01:46:30]  and I saw a lot of snow at the end.  I don't know.  Yeah, all right.  I'm a very able masturbator,  and I'm going to work on refining my technique on this trans-Siberian journey.  Nice.  Good luck to you, my friend.  Thank you.  It's Henry Rollins, everyone.  Thanks, Henry.  See you guys.  Bye.  There he goes, Henry Rollins.  You can tell from the instant feedback,  a lot of people are very, very protective of our little Jimmy.  Oh, that's why.  They lashed out and did not come back with any liking. 
[01:47:00]  I knew Jimmy could hold his own, though,  when she went into the whole Richard Pryor thing.  That was awesome.  Well, I didn't.  Was all the real dates and everything?  Of course it was.  Oh, my God.  Like Rain Man.  That was Rain Man-esque.  You're right.  And, again, my only issue there was not, again, about Pryor or whatever,  but just when I mentioned stand-up, it was just kind of a...  And, again, he explained himself.  It was just kind of a weird attitude I took.  Like, you know, dog jokes, almost like that's what stand-ups do.  Right, right.  Well, wait a minute, man.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you don't have to be a bad stand-up.  Well, it is.  Yeah.  But, I mean, whatever.  It led to a good conversation there about comedy. 
[01:47:30]  I didn't mind that all.  Someone wrote an instant feedback that said,  Henry Rollins was playing Pryor records while you were banging Sheely.  I was a comedian.  Jay?  Jay London?  Anything?  I've just had a great time here.  I'm more of in a catatonic state, but I think that's just where I should be right now.  I don't think Henry appreciated your brand of humor.  The guy was detecting a little, you know, he said,  you open up with jokes like the one that you told,  and you'll be eating tuna casserole at your mother's house. 
[01:48:00]  Well, it wasn't a tuna.  It was a casserole.  A casserole?  It wasn't even a tuna casserole, which is a lot better than a casserole.  Maybe where Henry's from, casserole is a very fancy dish,  and maybe that's a compliment.  Shepherds pie.  Keep giving, yes.  In a starchy world, mired in imperfection.  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel, but for some reason at this place,  they put it like on the grill.  One man.  It's all about me, me, me.  No challenge, the status quo.  They don't have a toaster?  That annoys me.  Navigating treacherous terrain. 
[01:48:30]  There's crap all over it.  Like I'm seeing grease.  Confronting the unknown.  And there's something green on it, which could be a pepper or a booger.  It's awful.  With a platoon of interns.  You sheep.  And military precision.  Go, go, go.  Fix it.  The world will witness a revolution.  Bagel diva.  Coming soon.  Come on.  To a bakery near you.  Are you kidding?  Club Soda Kenny?  We're replaying Club Soda Kenny while we're on vacation? 
[01:49:00]  Ugh.  We don't like Kenny when it's first time live.  Okay.  When Club Soda Kenny's in studio, we can't wait to turn his mic off and say,  okay, the end of that dumb segment.  Kenny's great for what he does on the road and everything, but live here in the studio?  Ugh.  Oh, did Pat interview him?  I wasn't here that day.  Yeah, Pat from CringeHumor.net.  Pat, this is something we got to do with Pat from CringeHumor.  His fucking interviews blow.  We got to get him to interview people.  He's just a fucking nervous Nelly. 
[01:49:30]  Well, that's what we do here.  Club Soda Kenny is interviewed by Pat from CringeHumor.net.  And then CringeHumor.net, I like the website, but Pat, he then ran onto his board and said  that we kind of threw him under the bus and then I set him up to fail.  It's like, what are you talking about?  Everyone knows you're a really, really, really bad interviewer.  And then you go on your website and get all cocky about it.  Did he say it like in a funny way?  No.  No.  Not at all.  Not at all.  It was something I wanted to bring up on the show a long, long time ago. 
[01:50:00]  Had a whole thread basically about how I threw him under the bus and the show threw him under  the bus.  We set him up to fail.  It's like, no, dude, you're just awful to begin with when you're interviewing people.  You run a great website.  I like it a lot.  I go there a lot.  But to try to claim it was something that I wasn't.  But that's part of the goof.  To me, it's like, but I mean, that's what's funny about it.  It's like, you're an awful, the thing, the reason that they sent me or you guys sent me  to interview Sabbath was because I'm a fan and I wasn't going to do it right.  I mean, that's part of the beauty of what it is. 
[01:50:30]  Right.  You understand when you're awful at something, you go with it.  Right.  Well, listen for yourself.  Club Soda Candy is interviewed by Pat from CringeHumor.net.  Putting my shades on.  Ooh.  I wish somebody would disrespect me.  You're cool.  Give a fuck?  I was in the Lord's.  I'll kick all your dicks with my face.  It's the worst.  Why don't we get Pat from CringeHumor.net.  We're trying to get through a bunch of things here. 
[01:51:00]  Unbelievable.  We also have PJ in studio.  You know, Kenny, you know, big girls give good head.  I wouldn't get that upset.  I'm a married man, sir.  I don't know what you're referring to.  I'm not a fool.  Huh?  It's so appealing.  Oh, what?  Sorry.  I think he wants to just go home at this point.  I'm not a fool.  Oh, I was just, it was like stuck in my head.  It just popped out.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  PJ, do you have anything?  Man, I don't know.  I'm just still, I always nice to fat girls because I know they give good head. 
[01:51:30]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Banana fool.  Yeah.  Yes.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana fool.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana fool.  All right, sorry.  Oh, yeah.  Comedy all about timing.  PJ, you would know that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think, you know, that was horrendous.  Your time on calling that girl fat. 
[01:52:00]  Like, whoa, Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  Yeah, that was very awful.  That was just unbelievable.  It was just rude, Kenny.  I ran out of things to say.  Do you have another joke?  That's funny.  I ran out of things to say.  I blurted that one out.  You're huge.  Do you have another joke for us?  Nah, let Patrick do his thing here.  Yeah, Patrick's here from CringeHumor.net.  Yes, I'm here to...  That's a great website.  That's my awful interview skills for Club Soap.  Yeah, you've been really taking a beating.  Opie says your interview skills...  I'm not the only one. 
[01:52:30]  Stink.  I'm not even going to defend myself.  It was fucking horrible.  Have you listened to his interview skills?  Well, I have.  They stink.  Terrible.  I completely choked that night in front of Opie.  You're dead?  Beautiful blonde hair.  Yes.  How...  What...  He was interviewing you?  Yeah, for some...  And Bob Kelly?  Yeah, we were filming...  They were sending to the troops.  Yeah, we filmed the show at the Comedy Cellar for the troops in Iraq.  Right.  So Opie stopped by.  We were going to do like man on the street interviews.  Cool.  He just busted my balls and made me choke up.  Bad.  What was he doing that was really bad?  He was just giving me one word answers. 
[01:53:00]  No, you just...  Your technique was awful.  Even Bob Kelly said it.  Are you this important that you need a camera guy with you?  Yeah, it's for the website.  It's my black photographer, Lamont.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, I've got a black photographer.  He knows he's black.  You don't have to point out to him.  He's actually the whitest black man there is.  He had the job.  What do you call a black...  He's got a job.  He stepped on it, Anthony.  I had another joke.  Now look at what you do.  Now you don't say it.  I had a really good joke and now I can't tell it because Tommy's all about timing. 
[01:53:30]  You want to hear a really inappropriate joke that was just presented to me from your  producers?  Yeah.  What do you say when you see your TV floating around your room in the dead of night?  Drop it, nigger.  Holy...  Jesus Christ.  Oh, man.  I'm telling you, this is a list of jokes I was given by your producers.  I don't even hear those jokes in the red states. 
[01:54:00]  Are you insane?  You're not that stupid, are you?  Are you crazy?  It was topical.  We were talking about a black man.  Do you know you're trying to endear yourself to the brass down there in Washington and you  blurt out a joke that can't even be taken any other way but insanely racist?  All right, maybe I can redeem myself with this one.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What do you think? 
[01:54:30]  What do you think?  You're hanging out with dice still?  No.  We'll take the joke page away from him, please.  Oh, my God.  I smell a tsunami coming.  Let's calm down.  You are fired.  And why didn't the colored gentleman punch him?  He's taking pictures.  He's taking pictures.  He's enjoying the joke so much he's taking pictures as you're telling it.  That's so he could give it to his peeps so they could bust Kenny's head open when you  see him.  It's over.  That's cringe humor.  You wait.  There's going to be a bunch of fat black guys chasing you down the street. 
[01:55:00]  All right, well.  So we got Patrick from CringeHumor.net and he wants to interview Kenny for the website.  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  Yeah, let me do my little gay intro here.  This is Patrick from CringeHumor.net with the legend and the world of comedy, the star  of HBO's Inside the NFL, the fourth member of the ONA show, and a runner-up for Breakthrough  Performer in the 2004 CringeHumor Awards, Mr. Club Soda Kenny.  How are you doing this morning, sir?  See how bad this is?  I told you.  I'm reading it verbatim.  He got that nervous, cracking thing going. 
[01:55:30]  Why would you ask me that question?  What?  How are you doing this morning, sir?  Yeah.  This is a little icebreaker.  All right, next question.  All right, let's start off with a question that most people have on their mind.  You have a problem with how you do it.  What a tool.  People want to know if you're a helmet head or an anteater.  That's your question?  That's...  All right.  That was fascinating.  Let's talk about you. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Thank you.  Helmet head or anteater?  It's a little take on your manhood down there.  Is it clipped or unclipped?  No, like...  Because that's what I asked all the girls at the porn world.  Right, right, right.  It's a little callback.  See, he's trying to hone in on you.  He's trying to be cute.  I got you.  Do you have an answer?  Yeah, like everybody.  Next.  All right.  Is it true that you're one of New Jersey's finest?  No.  What is your background in martial arts?  Why don't you ask me, like, nice questions? 
[01:56:30]  This is...  This is why I wanted to do this.  This is so bad.  All right.  Yeah, like, why don't you ask me, how old are you?  What's your favorite color?  Green.  All right.  Many people first fell in love with you when you were Andrew Dice Clay's right-hand man.  How did you come to work with Dice?  I was very lucky.  How did you meet him and strike up a relationship?  Come on.  Talk about something interesting.  Let's go.  We're talking about you.  This is what I was brought down for. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, so ask me questions like, did you go to college?  Did you go to college?  I have a PhD.  A pretty hard dick.  What am I, setting up your awful hack material here?  Man.  Man.  Can I ask some of your questions?  Because this is fucking horrible, man.  You run a site that critiques comics?  What do we got here? 
[01:57:30]  This is even you.  All right, listen.  Who are your comic influences?  That's actually a decent one.  Really?  I guess.  This is the best one I can read here.  No, like, a more interesting question would be...  Give him one more question.  Like, ask me, like, am I married?  Are you married, sir?  I was once engaged to a girl with a fake leg, but I broke it off.  Didn't you work in a hospital at one point? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I used to be a gynecologist, but I got fired because I got caught eating on the job.  What's the best thing about fucking a four-year-old in the shower?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Well, Patrick, that went great.  That freaking...  Patrick from CringeWin.net.  Thank you.  I represented myself well.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Corey Feldman?  We're rerunning the Corey Feldman thing? 
[01:58:30]  Appropriate.  I think you play the crap during vacation and people really appreciate when you come back.  But we call it worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's kind of like, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Get it?  It's not supposed to be.  Because everyone else calls it the best of.  Yeah.  So we call it worst of.  But in this case, it's truly our worst material.  Sit back, listen to this and how bad it really is.  It's Corey Feldman.  I don't know.  He thinks Michael Jackson might have been inappropriate with him when he was a kid.  And we kind of discuss it and play some audio.  This should be the hottest of Opie and Anthony if that's what he's talking about. 
[01:59:00]  It's just the worst.  I liked him right after Stand By Me.  Corey sure was something back then.  Before he got fat.  I didn't have the headphones on.  What happened?  That was it.  Oh.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, what's going on with Corey Feldman?  Well, I guess he's now saying that maybe something inappropriate did happen with Michael Jackson. 
[01:59:30]  I guess he's been subpoenaed or something by the grand jury here or the actual, what is it?  Are we past the grand jury now?  Yeah, yeah.  So he's going to testify in the Michael Jackson case?  Yep.  And for years he was saying nothing happened.  And he had had his relationship with Michael Jackson when he was a little kid, been to Neverland, hung out.  Michael Jackson took him all over the place.  They used to dress alike.  He put the little hat and the glove on and they danced together.  And everything was fine and dandy. 
[02:00:00]  But now, now he's saying, hmm, now that I think about it, inappropriate behavior is inappropriate behavior.  I think you remember it.  I think you remember certain things.  If it's just Michael Jackson taking you around Neverland, putting you on rides and things, that's one thing.  But anything other than that, like maybe magazines.  You either sat on a dick or you didn't.  There you go.  It's pretty easy to figure out.  Did you sit on a dick? 
[02:00:30]  11, 12 years later, he's now thinking, well, you know what?  Now I'm thinking that there were some suspicious things that were going on.  Yeah.  He just wants a little FaceTime.  And he's getting it as we speak.  ABC News.  I mean, this guy is attention starved.  He did a surreal life thing and then faded back into obscurity.  So now he's getting FaceTime and he doesn't really have anything, really.  He has no real details. 
[02:01:00]  No.  Just stupid crap.  Things that might have been inappropriate.  And things that I think were inappropriate.  I think so.  If you're Michael Jackson and your whole game here is the fact that you're just helping children.  You know, you love children so much that you're helping them out.  You know, he takes terminally ill kids and brings them to Neverland.  And if they're just riding on rides and everything, that's fine.  But anything more than that and anything remotely sexual is inappropriate. 
[02:01:30]  Let's go to the Corey Feldman audio.  More of our exclusive Corey Feldman police tapes.  Yeah.  Do the 1993 reporting suggest cops were on a witch hunt to trap Michael Jackson since his first case?  Jingle, as Mitchell says, the tapes could show the King of Pop is the victim of a hidden agenda.  Is your belief in him and your love for him getting in the way of you telling us anything?  Everything I've told you is true and there's, I mean, nothing happened.  Corey Feldman in 1993, grilled by Santa Barbara Sheriff Sergeant Deborah Linden and a detective about the actor's close friendship with Michael Jackson. 
[02:02:00]  Sometimes the two had even dressed alike.  But on the tape, obtained exclusively by CJ, Corey insists over and over the friendship was totally innocent.  While the cops repeatedly expressed suspicion for more than an hour.  I'm so concerned that if something happened, you're not going to tell us because it would be so hard to tell us. 
[02:02:30]  Or if you tried, if something happened.  No.  They want to hear what they want to hear, not what the witness wants to say.  Noted, Beverly Hills criminal defense attorney Jay Jaffe says the actor who gained fame in Stand By Me and The Goonies certainly sounds believable on the tape.  You don't know how many times I have racked my brain and gone, is there something I'm forgetting?  Is there something, you know, that I'm thinking, you know, didn't happen, but it really did?  If I could find something, I would love to be able to tell you.  But nothing happened.  Jaffe says while the investigators on the tape did not break the law, Jackson's defense team could use the cops' repeated aggressive questioning of the actor to bolster their claim that D.A. Tom Sneddon's long been on a witch hunt. 
[02:03:00]  I think that the defense would try to show that the investigators in this case are in fact not objective in their fact-finding process.  What they have is an agenda, and they're looking for something against Michael Jackson, even in the face of a claim that nothing really existed. 
[02:03:30]  Sergeant Linden, who does most of the questioning, is reportedly the same investigator who wrote the 1993 affidavit to get court approval to photograph Michael Jackson's private parts.  What?  And experience he calls.  A dehumanizing and humiliating examination by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff.  The big question?  Will Jackson's team now try to use Corey's 93 interview in the current case?  Everybody's happy.  Now in his mid-30s, Corey recently starred on The Surreal Life and is now a family man with a wife and young child. 
[02:04:00]  Corey's reps confirm he has been subvened by authorities to testify in Jackson's current molestation case.  Reports are Corey may now say there were things in their relationship that were inappropriate and wrong.  But if the judge allows Corey to take the stand, he may also allow in his 93 interview.  The defense could introduce the tape to impeach Corey Feldman when he said nothing ever happened, and he said that repeatedly. 
[02:04:30]  Reports are Corey will not accuse Jackson of molestation.  One anonymous source says Corey will claim Jackson showed him adult materials, including a Playboy magazine.  Corey's reps say he's under the gag order and can't comment.  All right, well, Anthony, no wonder why celebrity justice is shown in the middle of the night.  CJ, Opie.  It's called CJ.  No surprise that this piece of crap TV show is on at 4 a.m. in New York City. 
[02:05:00]  I know, I wake up in the middle of the night and there it is.  It's on.  What the hell did they just say?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing in it is all.  You need all the music going.  Corey Feldman.  We caught up with Corey Feldman.  That woman, I can't stand that woman on that show with her affected voice.  What a waste of time.  What is he going to say? 
[02:05:30]  Is her voice affected?  Yeah, just a tad.  I like her.  I didn't even notice her.  Oh, I can't stand her.  Bing, bing, bing.  Corey Feldman isn't going to say, hey, it was me a lost kid.  What?  Oh, she is the worst.  How many syllables are there in say?  In scabye?  New interesting twist in the Michael Jackson way on QI.  What? 
[02:06:00]  What are you saying?  They distract you with all the zings and zangs that they say nothing.  Then you're like, what did she just say?  I said absolutely nothing.  I'm snorting like Dee Dee now.  And I'm 1993.  Yeah, for the drag, man.  Yuck.  Just bear with me for one second, because now I've got to hear her voice.  I'm going to play the whole thing again, obviously.  Oh, it's so affected in Hollywood. 
[02:06:30]  It just has Hollywood...  Let me just hear her again.  ...blonde, screwed-away-into-this-job voice.  More of our exclusive Corey Feldman police tapes.  Do the 1993 reporting suggest cops were on a witch hunt to trap Michael Jackson since his first case?  Dave Willis-Mitchell says the tapes could show the king of pop is the victim of a hidden agenda.  Slaves could show Michael Jackson the king of pop.  That awful, bimbo, Hollywood voice. 
[02:07:00]  Well, they said absolutely nothing in that piece, Anthony.  I've watched Celebrity Justice a couple of times, hoping to see something.  You know, you're like, all right, this seems like an interesting little show, you know,  there's a little insight on some of the stuff celebrities go through with court and stuff.  Nothing.  Every show is like that.  They get to nothing.  They finish it off.  There's Jerry Seinfeld getting another parking ticket.  Wow.  Oof.  Real Celebrity Justice there. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Here's some...  Jerry Seinfeld in his Porsche getting another tia-tia.  Yeah.  Smack her in the head.  He could afford those tickets.  Of course.  He parks wherever the hell he wants.  I'm going to park in the middle of the street.  Right.  You don't care.  I don't care.  They make it sound like he got caught again.  No, he knows what he's doing.  He knows it like he cares.  What a surprise.  I was in a parking space.  He's got at least $100 million in his savings account.  Guess what?  He's parking wherever the hell he wants.  No, I can't afford it. 
[02:08:00]  I wouldn't worry about it.  No, who can't afford it is the mom from Seinfeld.  Oh, the poor mother from Seinfeld.  Jerry's mom.  Jerry's mom from Seinfeld is what?  Broke?  Bankrupt?  Seinfeld's TV mom files for bankruptcy.  Liz Sheridan is broke.  Jerry's TV mom.  75-year-old.  She's 75.  Veteran entertainer was Jerry's mom, Helen, on Seinfeld from 1990 through 98. 
[02:08:30]  Eight years on, like, the number one show ever.  She was also on ALF.  She was on ALF?  And ALF was a huge hit for, I think, NBC back in the 80s.  In the 80s.  So during the 80s and 90s, this woman had a successful career on two of the most popular  shows ever.  She had two, yeah.  And now she's broke.  She's filed for bankruptcy to get creditors off her back and begin anew.  She's a very proud, responsible woman, says somebody.  But she found herself drowning in credit card bills.  The actress owed 15 creditors, ranging from American Express to Victoria's Secret. 
[02:09:00]  Ugh.  More than $90,000.  Isn't Jerry a spokesman for Amex?  Yep.  Can he get her off the hook?  Let my mom go!  Oh, she's broke!  Sadly, among her personal property as a debtor, she has a list of her working Seinfeld scripts  totaling $1,000, rights to a book.  So I guess being bankrupt, she's got to sell off a lot of this stuff. 
[02:09:30]  Who gets her Victoria's Secret wear?  Oh, wow.  She has estimated assets at $50,000 and debt close to $100,000.  How are you on Seinfeld for eight years and you have $50,000 in the bank?  I mean, I hope he'll tell you.  $50,000 is nothing.  Yes.  He'll tell you again and again.  I do believe, Anthony, it's a mere bag of shells.  Oh, a drop in the bucket.  Easy come, easy go. 
[02:10:00]  Easy go.  I spent $1,000 to get the clicking out of the phone.  Clicking out of the phone!  Oh, yeah, wow.  So, yeah, Seinfeld's a TV mom.  Broke.  You know those Victoria's Secret panties are awful, too?  The white ones.  Remember, you ever see old window shades?  How they get yellow?  And, like, that's probably what their awful underwear looks like.  It broke old crow.  Manage your money better.  You're 75 already, for Christ's sake.  She wants to start anew.  Start anew. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, 75.  Good luck.  All right, well, back to Corey Feldman.  So, the paper has a lot more info than that stupid celebrity justice show.  Seinfeld's mom broke.  CJ catches up with her.  We caught up with her in Victoria's Secret, buying crotchless panties for her gray pack.  What did you do, dumping your pants? 
[02:11:00]  I got so excited doing the sound effects, I just nailed my shin really effing bad.  That'll hurt.  Looked like the turtle poked his head out a little.  Fuck.  We're in the middle of a really funny bit, too.  With their jings and zoos.  You all right?  That would really hurt.  What, your shin rubbed?  No, no, no, no.  All right.  Oh, man, that hurt.  Okay, yeah, according to the New York Post, Anthony, former child star Corey Feldman said  Michael Jackson once gave him a crash course in sex ed. 
[02:11:30]  Pew!  This is what you're going to find out on 2020 when Corey Feldman speaks.  In 2020.  And I'm sure they'll have that reflective shot of Corey just looking into the distance.  Well, now that I think of it, we were looking through Playboy magazines together.  They'll do the VO, as they say in the business, and there will be Corey Feldman just looking  off, reflecting.  Soft piano music, maybe?  Many years ago, he spent time with Michael Jackson.  He tells us now about that, that horrific day, when he dressed up like Michael Jackson 
[02:12:00]  and danced.  Oof.  And then had a kaleidoscope-colored cock stuck in his face.  All right, here's the deal.  So, when he was a young teen, Feldman stopped by Jackson's apartment, where the King of Pop  showed him a book of pictures of grown men and women naked.  The King of Pop-a-boner.  A picture of grown men and women naked.  The book was about VD. 
[02:12:30]  What?  The book was about venereal diseases and sex.  Oh, so he was teaching the church.  He sat down and he explained it to me.  He showed me some different pictures and discussed what those meant, Feldman said.  I was kind of grossed out by it.  I didn't think of it as a big deal at the time.  This is a pussy pustule from chlamydia.  You could get that from doing this to your tiny little buttock.  What an animal. 
[02:13:00]  Oh.  Ooh, turn the page.  And here's just the basic syphilis.  This will give you a little sores on your pee-pee.  Let me check yours for sores.  My fingers aren't very sensitive, but my mouth is...  All right.  Ha, la, la, la.  Woo-hoo. 
[02:13:30]  I'm giving you more info than celebrity justice, yes.  Did he put his pee-pee in his mouth?  Feldman, now 33, said it took years for him to conclude Jackson was behaving improperly.  Improperly, sorry, around a teen.  In light of recent evidence, I have to say that if my son was 14 years old and went to  a man's apartment and I knew that they were sitting talking about this, I would probably  beat his ass, he said.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, that'll teach him.  Yeah.  Beat his ass.  Ow, it already hurts, Pop.  Are you about an age 14?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  And then he ends with, Feldman said Jackson never molested him.  Can I help me get this PlayStation in the van?  It puts the doll in the basket.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin. 
[02:14:30]  Or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing.  A simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them it instead of by their names. 
[02:15:00]  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  I'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop drying out your big fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining. 
[02:15:30]  So, write down before I jam a bath.  Write down your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Say, turn me loose, don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed.  Precious, she's down here, you piece of shit. 
[02:16:00]  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store. 
[02:16:30]  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head,  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  The Opie and Anthony Show  XM 202  The Opie and Anthony Show 
[02:17:00]  Hey, how's your news?  Remember this bit, Anthony?  Oh, how could we forget?  It's a bunch of retarded reporters.  They interviewed Al Franken and Rob Reiner  at the Democratic National Convention.  That's how I remember it.  Right off the sheet I'm reading.  And we did a little singing, too, I think.  Yes.  Oh, this is where that song comes from?  Yes.  Rob Reiner.  Yeah, one of the famous songs, yes.  That we've played in a promo about 100 million times.  Yeah.  All right, well, we're getting ready for a brand new Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:17:30]  In the meantime, we got How's Your News,  and we did a little something on that.  So check this out right now.  It's the worst Opie and Anthony.  Doris.  It was embarrassing.  Doris from Indiana, what's going on today?  Not much.  No?  No.  Why are you calling the show?  I want to play What's in My Pants.  You want to play What's in My Pants?  Yep.  You know how to play?  I think I'm perched.  What?  I think I do.  Yeah?  All right.  It's where you take the phone and rub it on your intimate area, 
[02:18:00]  and we guess what kind of hairstyle you have just from the sound.  Uh-huh.  And you know that.  Uh-huh.  All right.  You want to play or what?  We played this yesterday.  We're trying to balance things out.  We did play yesterday.  I think we should play it again.  She called in.  We'll do it quick.  We'll do a quick game.  What about this, though?  I know.  I want to do that.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What to do?  I kind of want to play.  Hey, how old a gal are you?  44.  All right.  We're going to play the retard clips.  All right.  We're going to go to the sound clips that we had. 
[02:18:30]  Love that bit.  We've got the retard's doing the news clips.  Oh, I just want to punch you out of this show today.  Yeah, let's play the retard clips.  Yeah.  Should we have Doris call in tomorrow? 
[02:19:00]  Why don't you go smooth that one over?  Doris.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Hi.  Hi.  We might get to you, so hold on the line, all right?  All right.  44, though, huh?  Yep.  How many kids?  30.  Three kids?  Oh, Anthony, we're going to play the...  All right.  Let's pop that in the DVD, CD player.  And play the...  Audio.  Yeah.  Retard clips, sure.  Natural childbirth or cesarean? 
[02:19:30]  They were natural, and the last one was cesarean.  Oh, boy.  Look at the time, Anthony.  We might have to leave.  For the week.  Wow.  All right.  Well, how's your news?  Ben, go smooth that over.  We would love to talk to her tomorrow.  Yes.  Sure.  Two more years, she'll be able to call up and play What's in My Diaper.  Guess the hairstyle.  Gray? 
[02:20:00]  Uh, Doris?  Yeah.  Jim Norton has something he wants to say to you.  Okay.  I really appreciate your call on the show, and I hope we get to you, because I think  it'd be fun to play the game with you.  Okay.  Do you have a bunt?  Excuse me?  A bunt.  A bunt?  A bunt.  You know what that is, a bunt cake?  You know, it's not a belly, and it's not a...  Oh.  It's a bunt.  I try.  No, I don't have a bunt cake.  All right.  A bunt cake.  Anthony, do you have anything to say to Doris?  No.  Thank you for calling, and please hold on. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  There's Doris from Indiana.  Indiana.  House dress.  She wants to help the show.  All right, Anthony, how is your news?  It's in my bloomers.  This is a show they did on Trio.  Yeah.  This is retards doing the news.  Yeah.  They were at some camp or something, and all decided it would be kind of cool for them  to get together, something for them to do.  Put on a news program.  Right.  Where they would do interviews, and tape it, and broadcast it. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  So I think it's a very brave thing to do, Opie.  You know?  Just because they're...  I call them...  You know what I call them, Opie?  Handicapable.  A lot of people say handicapped.  I like saying handicapable.  Well, here's the deal with this.  They're not letting their handicaps get in the way of them fulfilling their dreams.  And living a normal life.  Well, they were at the...  Slow down.  We got audio of them at the Democratic Convention interviewing celebrities. 
[02:21:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And I'm sorry, man, but how could you not laugh when you listen to this?  And people would call you a jerk for laughing at this.  They would call you a jerk for laughing if they weren't calling you a jerk for the last  half hour of radio.  And I don't know.  It's just really funny.  I'm sorry.  It is funny.  And the people that they try to interview, because I guess they're trying to come across  as a legitimate news outlet, but they're retarded.  And the people that they interview put on that condescending voice, like, oh, yeah, okay. 
[02:22:00]  And they know they have to be nice.  Right.  Like, if it was any schmuck with a microphone that came up to them and was trying to interview  them, they would brush them off.  Nah, nothing for you today.  All right.  But they're retarded, so they have to be nice, and you could hear it in their voice.  Well, we think...  Well, this was on Trio last night.  We're going to run out of time, so...  Hey, that's great.  Yeah.  Let's get to the clips, okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  This is kind of the how's your news intro.  Listen to this.  And I think one of them speaks to James Carvel for a little bit here. 
[02:22:30]  Is this the girl?  Yeah.  She's, like, three feet tall, in a wheelchair.  Is she in a wheelchair?  No?  No, no.  This one is...  Her head's kind of like this, and she kind of always looks out.  She's got this bent neck.  She's always looking up.  But she's only about three or four feet tall.  Yeah.  All right.  Excuse me, Mr. Carvel?  Yes, dear.  How do you feel about a news program being hosted by people with disabilities?  A new program hosted by people with disabilities?  I'll be great.  Well, I think people with disabilities make an enormous contribution to this. 
[02:23:00]  Well, that's exactly what we're doing here.  We're shooting for a Man on the Street news documentary of our own that we're calling How's Your News.  Well, I'm good.  You know, I'm happy.  Hello, and welcome to How's Your News Convention Coverage 2004.  My name is Susan Harrington, and I'm a woman with disabilities who loves her life.  And I'm very excited to tell you all about this unique project we call How's Your News? 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Thank you very much, Alex.  Well, thank you for honoring me by talking to me about this.  Thank you.  Anytime you want me on, you just let me know, sweetheart.  All right.  You know, he wants to say something.  The guy very opinionated.  Well, thank you for honoring me by talking to me.  Yeah.  Sure.  That's what you were thinking.  That's exactly what you were thinking.  And, hey, sir, let it be known that the feeling is mutual, okay?  All right.  I like that to this program. 
[02:24:00]  How's Your News is a news team made up of people with various disabilities.  We all met at a summer camp many years ago, and it was at this camp that we came up with  the idea of making our very own version of the news.  One time at Retard Camp.  We came together with some counselors from the camp, and we selected a crack team of  six outgoing reporters.  Here they are.  This is Bobby.  Most of the time, we can't understand what he is saying, but he does understand us. 
[02:24:30]  And, hey, he always seems to get the scoop.  We just work here.  We just work here.  We just work here.  I'm sorry.  If you're not laughing at that.  Hilarious.  If you're not laughing at that, what, you're probably a decent human being?  Yes.  All of compassion.  Guys, we just work here, man.  This here is Larry.  Like Bobby, he understands everything which is said to him. 
[02:25:00]  But since he can't talk, we've made a board with four questions on it.  And he uses the mics to point out the one he wants to ask.  And this is...  What was that?  Wait a minute.  Oh, God.  Hold on.  Here we go.  And he uses the mics to point out the one he wants to ask.  I recognize that. 
[02:25:30]  He either asked about paramilitary operations in Iraq or he shit his pants.  This is Sean Costello.  He's known for having a pretty subtle sense of humor.  Hey, I bet.  What?  Steve, why did you give that look?  No, because this is a serious story.  Jeremy here is 18 years old.  He's got a lot of energy and curiosity.  And he sure doesn't like to stay on one subject for very long.  And ask his forgiveness and stop that practice. 
[02:26:00]  Do you have any favorite bands that you listen to?  And then there's Ronnie.  He loves celebrities, especially celebrities from the 1970s.  B.J. Honeycutt.  How the hell are you?  Yeah.  How you doing?  Good.  How's Alan Alda doing?  Tonight, you are very lucky because you have tuned in to our most exciting adventure today.  That's right, Susan.  Can you believe it?  This crew is going to the Democrat and Republican conventions. 
[02:26:30]  We're certainly not your typical news team.  But, hey, maybe that's what this election needs is a little sense of humor.  Get ready for something completely different, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for How's Your News?  Oh, brother.  Oh, brother.  He's the funny one, I guess.  He's the one with retard strength.  When he sees a celebrity, he runs over and he kind of like grabs him and locks him in so they can't move. 
[02:27:00]  All right, let's go to the second clip.  How's your news, Anthony?  This is Peter Jennings, right?  Yeah.  Okay, sir.  What's your name?  My name is Susan Harrington, and I'm one of the reporters.  Hi, Susan.  I'm Peter Jennings.  I work for ABC.  It's nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  How do you feel about being here at the convention?  I feel excited.  Do you feel excited about being here?  Yeah.  I think the excitement you're feeling is a two-way street.  I think if I had your voice and your charm, I'd get better ratings at night. 
[02:27:30]  You fraudulent Canadian jizzbag.  You would get more ratings because it would be a complete freak show.  Imagine him sitting there, Peter Jennings looking like he does and going, hi, it's Peter Jennings with the news.  I'd start watching the news every night.  Everyone would watch.  Are you kidding me?  He's absolutely right.  Oh, yes.  You hear how he all of a sudden was like, yeah.  And what's your name?  I would, what's your name? 
[02:28:00]  Hmm.  Because if you don't tell me, I'll just think of you as drooling idiots.  Thank you.  Bunch of corkies.  How nice to see you.  Thank you.  Well, thank you very much.  In the meantime, live from the floor of the Democratic Convention, this is Susan Harrington reporting live for How's Your News.  I want to know why she laughed.  Did he tickle her clit with a pig's foot?  Coming up, see what Hillary Clinton says when Sean and Larry catch up with her. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, please don't change the dial to CBS or anything like that.  Just stay tuned.  Well said.  Did I hear him say butt?  All right.  Jesus.  Come on.  They caught up with Al Franken in this clip.  Who's the retard in this clip?  You know, I didn't understand that.  I'm sorry. 
[02:29:00]  All righty.  Yeah.  I'm Al Franken.  I'm covering this convention.  Yeah.  Are you having a good time?  I am.  Who have you talked to so far?  Bullion.  Bullion.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  You know, I couldn't agree more. 
[02:29:30]  Maya.  Yeah.  It was really nice talking to you.  I'm glad you're here.  Yeah.  I think it's fabulous.  I, I, I, I, I, I shot.  Yeah.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I shot.  Can I shake your hand?  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  What's he saying?  Okay, have a good time.  Al Franken is so uncomfortable.  In that clip.  Ah, blah, blah, ah, blah, blah.  What is that? 
[02:30:00]  I don't know.  I wonder what he was trying to say.  Maybe someone out there speaks retard.  I don't know.  God damn how frustrating that must be.  Like, because I think the girl was saying that he, he can think, but he just can't talk.  Right.  So he's trying to ask him something.  It's a horrible position to be in, too, because you know the camera's right on Al Franken.  Like, in his mind, it's probably like, oh, you ass, you know, hey, Al Franken, you asshole liberal.  And it comes out, ah, blah, blah, ah, blah, blah.  Well, no, if he's a complete retard, he's probably telling Al Franken, I agree completely with your political beliefs. 
[02:30:30]  All right, here's Triumph, the insult comic dog.  Oh.  What's your name?  What, Triumph, the insult comic dog?  Well, it comes to me as a dog, huh?  Yes.  Oh, what are you doing, comic dog?  What am I doing?  Yeah, what are you doing?  You know, I'm here to do what all the reporters are doing, you know, ask questions about the issues, sniff their butts, hump their legs, that kind of thing. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Oh, you could tell he was thrown.  He was a little thrown.  He wasn't thrown.  If he had any balls, he would have attacked you.  That's a dumbbell right there.  Why not?  Why not?  That's great.  You have great chromosomes for me to poop on.  That's great.  Where's your mother, the one pregnant, drinking and smoking?  So, at what trimester did your father punch your mother in the stomach? 
[02:31:30]  Look at your haircut.  My hairdo is better around my asshole.  I'd rather have a conversation with a cigar in my mouth. 
[02:32:00]  Look at your head.  It's huge.  You look like a boxer.  I've looked at the smaller heads humping a great dame from behind.  That is a huge head.  Oh, my God.  This shows awful.  He lost his balls.  He did.  He didn't go after him.  He was all, yes, we're here to cover the election.  I believe he was neutered.  Your parents should have been spayed and neutered to keep freaks like you from walking the earth. 
[02:32:30]  The way you stand there like a stump, I was going to pee on you.  I mistook you for a tree.  Then I realized a tree is smarter.  Pete Rose called.  He wants his hair back.  And he's bedding five to one.  You're not even human. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, man.  We have time maybe for like one or two more of these.  Hi, this is Ronnie Simonson.  Today I'm interviewing the meathead.  All in the family.  And, of course, we used to sing those things songs.  And today...  Can you stop for a second?  First of all, Rob Reiner does not want to be called the meathead, ever.  The guy is now a director.  He, you know, he was the meathead on All in the Family, but you don't want to be called 
[02:33:30]  that after you've moved on for 40 years or whatever it's been.  And here he comes.  He's got to...  You know, if anyone else called him meathead, he wouldn't give him the time of day and would  walk away.  But here he's a retarded, so he's got to entertain this guy.  Hi, this is Ronnie Simonson.  Today I'm interviewing the meathead.  All in the family.  And, of course, we used to sing those things songs.  And today...  Boy, the way, Glenn Miller plays.  Signs of age, the head pirate. 
[02:34:00]  Guys are like we had it, men.  Children of the days.  And you know what you were then.  Girls were girls and men were men.  Mister, we can use a Democrat party like Kerry again.  There you go.  Oh, God.  Mister, we could use a hanger if your mother gets pregnant again.  Oh, my God.  I'm drooling like a retard 
[02:34:30]  That'll be a promo 
[02:35:00]  I hear a new Jimmy sing  I just can't help  I just can't help  Do we have time for one more?  We need to go late today  Is that possible?  I don't even know if the system is set up  Listen to Wolf Blitzer being a dick  To the kid  When Kerry gets elected  What would you like to see 
[02:35:30]  Kerry and Edwards change  As far as changes to them in this country?  You're pretty positive that they're going to be elected, are you?  Because, you know, there's another side  The Republicans, they want to get elected, too  Oh, I know, but right now I'm just thinking  I think you're meant to say if they get elected  Right, if and when, yeah  Well, you keep saying when  You don't know for sure they're going to get elected  Right, but I'm saying if  I meant to say if and when  If they get elected  Yeah  Because the Republicans might get elected 
[02:36:00]  Right  We don't know, the election's very close  That's true  Yeah  So what's the question again?  But if and when  Kerry and Edwards get elected  What would you like to see them change?  He was brutal with her  What's the question, you retard?  I like Wolf  Yeah, right?  The only one that actually stood up to those retards  How many times have I said it's stupid?  It's a genetic embarrassment  Wipe your mouth  The OPN Anthony Show  Keith the cop now 
[02:36:30]  Oh, wow  I see disaster in the first four little words  Keith tells a story  Wow  I thought we were doing better radio than this  Keith is a good storyteller  Keith tells a story  It's like someone broke jars of ether in the studio  We're all just kind of listening  But  It's in the slow  And then the cruiser came to a stop 
[02:37:00]  And something happened with Keith the cop  When we were on commercial radio  He had a lot more confidence  He's a nervous Nelly  Just nervous  On this satellite radio  Takes up five minutes to get three words out  His mouth is dry  He's a good  He's the worst plugger, by the way, of anything  He tried to plug something once  I wanted to hug him  As we're going off  It's like  Game fly  I'm on the adrenal server  He's horrid  But he's great at getting you out of tickets 
[02:37:30]  That's true  And he runs a heck of a motorcycle ride  That's right  To be perfectly frank, if I may  Here's Keith the cop  Telling some dumb story  Alright  The worst of Opie and Anthony  Hey, hey  Hello  That's pretty cool to check out, huh? 
[02:38:00]  We got Drew Boogie live in the studio today  Mixing and spinning and scratching  Itching  I don't know  Whatever the hell he does  But he's cool as hell  Hello  I love the sound  It's pretty cool  Alright, we're back  With the Opie and Anthony program  Also want to say hi to Keith the cop  Keith  Keith's in studio today 
[02:38:30]  Good morning, gentlemen  And he had something unusual happen to him  On the way to work today  Or on the way to the show today  Good morning  Well, I figured since I was coming in  And I haven't been in a while  I would pass downtown  And look for our pal Tippi Tom  Now imagine that  We might have had Tippi Tom  On the show today  But since he's a true homeless guy  He's kind of hard to find  Because he doesn't have a home  You can't just pull up and bring him in  But boy, that would have been fun today  Friday with old golden buns here in the studio 
[02:39:00]  But you kind of know some of the areas he hangs out in, right?  Territorial sort of guy  He hangs out down in the meat market sort of area  I hang out in the meat market  We've got to get him back on  Golden buns  Golden buns  So actually, Ben did see him up in Penn Station  Not too long ago  So I guess he migrates north for the cold weather  To hang out in Penn Station  Brilliant 
[02:39:30]  How come he doesn't go down like underground  Where all those mole people go?  I don't think the homeless are really into the mole people  That's actually like a whole separate society  Oh, okay, that's the same thing?  Yeah  Yeah  Homeless are just homeless  Walking around the streets  How do you become a mole person?  Someone says, come on down, check it out  Fall in a manhole  All right, so you were looking for Tippy Tom this morning  Yeah, so I was driving up and down in the meat market  And, well, I guess I kind of forgot 
[02:40:00]  That when you're driving up and down in the meat market  Eight to ten times back and forth  That you bring some attention to yourself  Now you should know this more than anybody  I should know this  And, you know, but I'm on a mission  I'm looking for Tippy Tom  And I wasn't thinking much  And I have to commend my fellow brothers in blue  Who this morning were driving around in an unmarked vehicle  And I figured they were  I'm driving and all of a sudden I hear a little whoop whoop 
[02:40:30]  And I see the little teardrop in the dashboard of the car  And I figure, oh, they're going to a call  Let me pull over to the side and let them go by  And, well, I was the call this morning  They weren't trying to get around you  They're pulling you over  So cops pulling over a cop  And basically I pulled over  And they pulled over  And I go, oh, what the hell  And I go, oh  They think you're picking up a tranny 
[02:41:00]  Because, you know, when you are driving around down there  And you're driving kind of slow  And I'm looking along the building line  You know, there are these trannies  And they see you  And they wave and stuff  You know, like they think you're cruising  Right  And obviously so did the NYPD  You were driving slow  Kind of looking out your window  Looking for Tippy Tom  Right  And so I pulled over  And they got out of the car  And come up to the window  And, of course, they have the same smart-ass sort of comment  Like I always have 
[02:41:30]  And they go, uh  Looking for a date?  And I'm like, you offering handsome?  You know, and  It was slightly embarrassing at that point  Just, you know, because they think I'm looking for a date  Yeah, for that split second  That you happen to  You know, I pulled my ID out  And I said, no, I'm not looking for a date  And, uh  You know, they go  They go, oh  And, you know, I don't think they believed me right away  Until I did mention my 
[02:42:00]  Oh, now we got a brother here who's looking for a tranny  They're like, oh, look at this cock-sucking face  So, uh  It turned out, you know  I mentioned my affiliation with the show  I said, you know, I happen to work with the opening of this show  And I'm looking for  And they did know the show  And, oh, yeah, yeah  And, uh  They said, you know  I really didn't fit the description  They said most of the time around that time  They get meaty-titted white guys  With, uh  Driving a Saturn with jersey plates  That's usually the type of people that are stopping at that point in time 
[02:42:30]  In the morning  I don't have jersey plates  With Tippi Tom, that's a good one  I have to remember that  Yeah  I thought this was Tippi Tom  Do you think they were buying it?  Uh, yeah  I think when I met  They weren't buying it until I did mention  Yeah  And they knew Tippi Tom from the old days  But there was nothing they could do to you, right?  No, no  Just harass you a little bit?  That's pretty much what they were  You know, you can get guys for cruising  But you'd have to  I love when the cops know the show, man 
[02:43:00]  That is the best  I got pulled over once going down the Belt Parkway  I was flying  And the cops call that area the killing fields  You know, you see people pulled over there all the time  And they got pulled over  And it was highway patrol, you know  So he's got his glasses and his leathers on and everything like that  And he comes over  Just badass  You know, license, registration, insurance  Just right by the book and everything  Goes back to the car  I didn't tell him anything 
[02:43:30]  You know, I wasn't even going to try to get out of it  But apparently when he called my name over  Somebody had told him  Oh, that's Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show  So I see him get out of the car  I look in my rearview mirror  And he's got this big smile on his face  As he's walking over  His attitude  He might as well have been a different person  You know, when they come up to the window  And they're all badass and stuff  You're like  Intimidated  Kind of, you know  I'll be polite, nice  Try to get out of this  Unscathed  And then he comes up just like  Hey, dude, what's up? 
[02:44:00]  Love the show  Skated another one  That's awesome  Love when they like the show  Hate when it's somebody that you know is out of the demo  You know, when I get pulled over  And I see a black woman walk up to the door  I don't even mention it  Have you ever heard of Opie and...  No, just give me the ticket  Please, thank you  Hey, this is Adam Ferrari  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  The worst  It's absolutely awful  Enjoy  XM 202 
[02:44:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  Everyone was scared  No one's scared today  I am  We're not scared  Speaking of being scared  News teasers  I don't know  Shark attacks  It's all about the sharks this summer  This is huge  The shark attacks  The news  They were petrifying us with these  And the fact of the matter is  Not many people get attacked or hurt by sharks  And I guess we kind of go over that  Yeah, definitely 
[02:45:00]  It's one of our favorite things to do  Is talk about the fear  That the news generates  On you and I  As we just try to live our lousy lives  So here it is  Shark attacks  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun  Wait, that's not the Jaws theme  How does it go?  Yeah, it's kind of  It's the worst 
[02:45:30]  And finally a little news wrap up  Just starting the show a little different today  Another shark attack in Florida  Shark attack  And the news just showing  Sharks just swimming offshore  Where that girl was eaten pretty much alive  This one just 100 miles from the last shark attack  That's what they're saying  Who cares?  It's 100 miles  That's pretty far  I don't think it's the same guy  How about this?  Why don't people just stay in the pools in Florida? 
[02:46:00]  There you go  Stay away from the ocean  Stay in the pool?  It's nice  How about this?  You just go about business as usual  People are not getting bitten by sharks  Like the news shows  Another teen shark attack  This was a 16 year old boy  Was he killed?  No  He lost his leg though  They had to chop his leg off  Shark really messed him up  How many people conservatively do you think  Swim in Florida every year? 
[02:46:30]  Wow  1,000?  2,000?  Gotta be  I'd say could be a little higher than that  It's possible  Could be more than that, Jim  Yeah  Let's just say a lot  Well, in the year 2000  There were 37 shark attacks  37 shark attacks  2001, 34  2002, 29  2003, 30  2004, 12  You know what though?  So it's safe to say  2005 will be around 30 again 
[02:47:00]  That's it  Wait, how many in the earlier date?  2,000?  37  What's the earliest they go back?  2,000?  Well, they're just showing the last five years, I guess  Oh, okay  I wonder if they're increasing  Since the international shark attack file started keeping records in 1882  There have been 500 attacks in Florida  Since 1882  Since 1882  Hold on  1882?  1882  500 attacks  In Florida 
[02:47:30]  And that's not deaths, that's attacks  Oh, resulting in 12 fatalities  Okay  Since 1882, 12 people have died from shark attacks in Florida  1882  123 years  And the news is talking about this  Like this is the biggest danger to your kids  They're all doing reports on it  How to keep your kids safe  Do you know  Probably  Any activity  Ever, ever  Has resulted in more deaths  Of course  Since 1882  This is the whole culture of fear we talk about all the time 
[02:48:00]  Dude  I would go as far to say  Picking wax out of your ears  Since 1882  More people have died from that activity  Than shark attacks in Florida  People that eat oysters  There you go  Oh, good, good one  Food poisoning  Oysters  Oysters  Oysters  Oysters  More deadly than sharks  But not nearly as scary  What the hell was going on in 1882?  That's when they started this record keeping  500 attacks since then 
[02:48:30]  12 fatalities  What happened there?  1882 is like  Women had to still go to the beach in dresses  Yeah  Yeah, some guy in like a big stovepipe hat  Help me!  Help me!  Just getting dragged under  And some guy on the beach decided to go  Hmm  Got a paper and a pencil, pencil  Bob was eaten by a shark  Thigh-high bathing suit  You know the ones that start at the chest  And they go all the way down to your mid-thigh  Stripes  Stripes  Parasols  They all get changed in those striped booths on the beach  With a little triangular flag on the top 
[02:49:00]  Shark grabbed him by his handlebar mustaches  Dragged him out to sea  Unhand me, scoundrel!  1882  1882  500 attacks in the Florida area  That's nothing  12 deaths  That's it  That is nothing  Sharks stink  500 attacks  They only killed 12 people  That's not scary at all  What nerds  But the stupid news  And the culture of fear  You know  They make it sound like  You might as well not even go swimming this year 
[02:49:30]  Don't go swimming  Absolutely out of their minds this year  And I guess they were out pretty far  Is what happens  Go out past the point of where a lot of swimmers are  And you're more in their territory  You know when I was a little boy  And I saw Jaws  Because it scared me so much  That I used to pretend that in my apartment swimming pool  That I was Roy Scheider  And I was going to kill a shark  A little Jimmy Robinson get eaten on the  Just a little fag on the raft 
[02:50:00]  A little Jimmy Robinson comes spilling out all over the dock  I like whenever they're talking about these shark attacks  Because now there's a whole thing  Should they close the beaches  Should they close the beaches  And every time I hear it I just think of the mayor  Those beaches will stay open  It's the 4th of July  We're not going to close those beaches  Which is coming up this weekend  Yep  That's right  4th of July  4th of July  There have been some injuries to a couple of bathers 
[02:50:30]  A couple of injuries  I was trying to sugar coat the whole thing  The girl was ripped to shreds  A perfect politician  Little boy swallowed whole  Who cares  Didn't this coat have anchors on it?  Yeah it had the little anchors  My chief  My son was in that water too  I  Just sign it  Mayor  Highways  High  The mayor  He turned into Dr. Bellows  Oh yeah  He had no clue what's going on  All his cronies too  Like the business owners  And the other guy 
[02:51:00]  Stefano DiMera  He was in it  A bunch of clowns  Just one of the  Just one of the beaches open  Oh look  See they're doing the story on TV right now  Of course  Here's the culture  Showing the shark  Shark expert  They showed the girl  Who was  Killed  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun  Scary music  Sharks in the water  Holy shit  And you go swimming  What happens to you?  Nothing  Absolutely nothing  You know you see it  Everyone swallow  You get a little nibble  Like whoo  What was that? 
[02:51:30]  I swallowed some water  Oh a jellyfish  Or a crab like you know  Walks over your foot  Seaweed scrapes by your leg  Oh I lose it in the water  Because there are just monsters under there  I don't care if it's a shark  Or a rock  It's a monster  I don't have a good view of it  I will not go in the water  I hate the ocean water  I go down when we go on vacation  The Bahamas  Or go on the cruises  Or something like that  I am petrified  I bob around in the water  And it's kind of cool  Because you can see 
[02:52:00]  In that nice blue water  But you ever go swimming up here?  You go to the New York beaches?  Stinks  It's like a green brown muck  That you can't see  Like an inch down  You have absolutely no idea  What's down there  And there's just everything down there  You feel rocks  Seaweed  There's jellyfish  Crabs  You've never went to  Horseshoe crabs  Scare the piss out of me  Because they can't do anything to you  They're those wacky  Prehistoric looking  Little things with the  Big stinger thing on the back 
[02:52:30]  It looks like  It's like a two foot stinger  Those things are  Too busy fucking all day  Are they?  Oh my god  You always see them up on top of each other  Every time you go to the beach  They're all  They're just humping  They're just humping away  Can't they sting you?  No they can't  They really can't  That stinger thing  Kind of goes up like a little boner  But it doesn't go high enough  Where you're going to step on it  And it really isn't  It doesn't have a joint on it  Where it can kind of get to you  Or it doesn't have the power  To back into you  So it just kind of  Walks around  But they're creepy looking 
[02:53:00]  And if you step on one  You're just getting  The shit scared out of you  Let me ask you something  Yeah  We were brought up  On Long Island  Crab Meadow Beach  As a kid  I used to go to  You've never like  Taken a boat  To the middle of  The Long Island Sound  And just jumped in?  Ooh  Never  I used to ride my jet ski  Out in the Sound  And you'd pass over  These areas  That are dark  Where the water  Would be like  Black  Just dark  And you knew  You were over  A huge crevice 
[02:53:30]  That just  It made  The water was real still  In one little area  Real still  And a lot darker  Than the surrounding water  And I'd just  You go right over it  And go like  Look down  And go  Oh please don't fall off now  Please don't fall off  Yeah cause it's gonna matter  If you fall off  In a hundred feet of water  Or a thousand feet  Just the thought  Of bobbing  In the water  And having that much  Nothingness under you  And the creatures  That are down 
[02:54:00]  I am scared  Pissless  Of ocean animals  It was probably  Just a whale feeding  Can you imagine?  You see ripples  On the water  Cause I loved jet skiing  Loved it  Did it all the time  But I was petrified  Of what was under that water  And I've  Ditched my jet ski  A few times  And I'd fly over  You know  The handlebar  Or cut the turn  And hit a wave wrong  And you just get  Thrown off the side  Of the thing  And you gotta swim  Back to it  And as you're swimming  Back all I'm thinking  Is oh my god  Nothing touched my leg 
[02:54:30]  Oh if something  Touched my foot  I'm dead  Oh my god  I will freak out  I can't take it  And I get back  On that jet ski  So quick  Yeah  And be like  Like an acrobat  Do a backflip  Out of the water  Land on the sea  Scares the shit  Out of me  And they're not  So much sharks  You know  Whatever  I don't care  If it's a friggin minnow  It's gonna scare  The piss out of me  You see these  Jacques Cousteau shows  And stuff  When I was a kid  And the divers  Are down there  With these groupers  You ever see those fish 
[02:55:00]  They're gigantic  They have them  At Atlantis  Yeah  In the Bahamas  Huge  And you know  They're just  They're just fish  They're not really  Gonna fuck with you  But if I saw  Something like that  In the water  That's it  Put me in a box  It's done  How about if you saw  A nurse shark  Those faggity sharks  That do nothing  But just look dumb  They're harmless  But they are giant  They're like  30 feet long  These things  And they show divers  Petting them  And they look like sharks  You know  They kinda have the body 
[02:55:30]  And stuff  They just don't have  Those big teeth  Yeah  And it's just  How do you swim  With this thing  Well  We got a local news tease  I gotta play this  Cause we  We laugh at these  Local news teases  Oh because the news  No matter what city  You live in  The news has to have  Their little angle on it  The shark attacks  Are in Florida  But every state  Every city in the country  Is gonna talk to you  About shark attacks now  And how it affects you  I'm sure they even  Had this in Las Vegas  Iowa  Yeah  Sharks in the cornfield 
[02:56:00]  Right  You would think not  But  Could sharks enter  The farm's irrigation system  We'll tell ya  And then you wait  Till 10.55  And they go  No  That's absolutely impossible  Why did you even  Think of it  Considering it  You idiots  You idiots  We got you  To listen longer  Or watch longer  Alright here's the tease  From one of the  New York TV stations  Bull sharks  It's the kind  To kill this teenager  We will show you 
[02:56:30]  How violent they can be  Plus are they  Swimming in our area  Are they swimming  In our area  Hmm  Oh god  This is why we do  The assault  On the media  Right here  Is a perfect  Example  Thank you  A perfect example  Why we have no  Respect for the local  Media  None whatsoever  Fear mongering  Just bastards  Scumbags  Scumbag  Fear  Spreading  Bastards 
[02:57:00]  In our area  We'll talk to shark experts  And I'm sure they have the reporter  At the beach  Talking  Look  These waters behind me  Do they contain a hidden danger?  Beneath the surface  You see people frolicking on  Could lurk death  And I'm sure Florida  With their 12 deaths  Since 1882  Blows away  New York's death count  As far as sharks  Attacks go  I'm sure it blows it away 
[02:57:30]  There's probably been  Three  Since the 1800's  I bet  Yeah  And they will scare  The piss out of you  Is there a serial killer  Wandering around  In your backyard?  We saw BTK's  Chilling confessions  Of murder  Yesterday on the news  Could it happen here?  Is your neighbor  A serial killer?  Huh?  What?  We'll give you signs  To watch out for  Yeah  We'll tell you  What to look for  Oh, cause you're the expert  On serial killers now  Fear monger 
[02:58:00]  Fucks  That's why we do  The assaults on the media  We put fear  In the hearts of reporters  Fear that there's gonna be  An Opie and Anthony  Kook behind you  Making you lose your cool  And lose your job  Never good advice either  Ever  It's just always  Shallow garbage  Never  Every year  Say they got the  Pat ones  Every snow storm  Go out  Make sure you have  Your milk  And flashlight batteries  And water  Anytime there's a storm  A blackout 
[02:58:30]  Remember  Fill up your bathtub  With water  Like we're living in  The 1800s  Where the water  Isn't gonna work  For any length of time  Power failures  Are extremely inconvenient  They are inconvenient  But unless you're  In an iron lung  They're not really  Life threatening  You know  Even the hospitals  Have backup generators  That'll just keep running  And running  And running  Until they get the power on  You know  You don't really sweat  A power failure anymore  It's not like the old days  And they're pretty good  With getting it on quickly 
[02:59:00]  But  You're not gonna be  Without TV  Eh  You know  Your computer  Video games  Okay  It is a little  Life threatening  But  But  They make it sound  Like you're gonna be  Stranded in your house  For weeks on  When was the last time  You  In the New York area  I don't know about  Around the country  But  You were stuck  In your house  Because of a snow storm  For any length of time  That really mattered  The 1977 ice storm  Yeah  When they realized  Wow  We need more plows  Up the budget for plows 
[02:59:30]  And now  You know  The streets get plowed  There's a couple  That get screwed up  And people complain  Why my streets ain't plowed  Why I go and look  In some other towns  And all them streets  Is plowed  Oh there's a reason  Why your streets  Aren't plowed  They haven't welded  Gun protection  Bulletproof guards  Over the  The cab of the plows  It's our way  Of keeping you guys  At home  So you don't commit crimes  Hard to run  With stolen merchandise  On the ice  Isn't it  Oh it's a conspiracy 
[03:00:00]  Yes it's a big conspiracy  Why do you think snow  Is white  That's right  Point  I want to listen  To that news tease again  Yeah  Because these things  Make me laugh  Bull sharks  It's the kind  That killed a teenager  We will show you  How violent they can be  Plus are they  Swimming in our area  Wow  Bull sharks  I call them  Bravo Sierras  That's what I call them  Dooshbag  Oh that's just awful  Yeah so 
[03:00:30]  They're fear mongers  Spread the fear  Shark attacks  In our area  Alright here we go Anthony  We're getting more facts  On shark attacks  The United States  Averages just  16 shark attacks  Each year  Each year  And slightly less  Than one shark attack  Fatality  Every two years  Every two years  On average  Obviously  Yeah  Meanwhile  In the coastal U.S. states alone  Lightning strikes  And kills more than  41 people each year 
[03:01:00]  41 people a year  Get it from lightning  Right  So obviously  More of a chance  Of getting hit by lightning  But see  The new  You know  A news story  On lightning strikes  Yeah  It's kind of boring  In the coastal states  It says  The lightning  For the coastal states  Yeah  Yeah because you can't  Include the entire country  Which then  Would be a huge number  Right  Of course it would be  Of course  But to do a story  On that  That's just boring  Well they probably  Only did the coastal states  Because of the  That's where the sharks 
[03:01:30]  Well yeah  That's exactly  They're trying to compare  The shark attacks  To other things  That could happen  In those areas  And yeah  Lightning's a lot  More dangerous  Australia's like  Kicking ass  As far as the  Yeah  Shark attacks go  According to the  International shark attack  File  Between  15  How to survive  Jaws  Hold on  Oh my god  Here it is  Maybe feeding more frequently  And that's usually  Dawn and dusk  So avoid periods  Of dawn and dusk  Here it is  And you're less likely  To be attacked by a shark  Which by the way 
[03:02:00]  Is a very very low probability  To begin with  And what about  What you wear Greg  He's the shark expert  What you wear  Well we know that sharks  Feed on small schooling fishes  In many cases  Unless you don't press  Like a little fish  You'll be fine  Leave your seal outfit  At home  Shit  To perhaps attract a shark  Or you may actually mimic  A bait fish  So you don't want to do that  So avoid those kind of shiny objects  So even if you do all those things  And try to avoid it  But the worst things happen  You see a shark  Yesterday we were talking to a surfer 
[03:02:30]  And he said it's not uncommon  For him to see sharks  She didn't get enough fear  Out of this guy  So she's going to keep trying  He said it's uncommon  He's not frightened by that  The average person's going to freak out  What do you do if you see a shark in the water?  Scream  Well I think if you're an average person  If you're an average person  And you see a shark  You are going to freak out  And the best thing to do  Is just keep your eye on it  And leave the water  And leave the water very calmly  Don't panic  Don't splash  They show sharks eating  During this feature by the way  They're showing sharks eating 
[03:03:00]  To scare you more  Like the young boy  Monday morning  What do you do?  He was fishing  What do you do if the shark eats you?  And his brother and another friend  They're pounding on the shark  Because once it gets a hold of you  It doesn't want to let go  So listen to the shark  Listen to how she's building the fear  In the cases where a shark does bite you  And it is holding on to you  It's grabbing you with its jaws  Strike the shark wherever you can  Let the shark know that you are not an easy prey  Hit him in the balls  Go ahead and punch it any way you can  Eyes, nose  Anywhere you can reach on the shark 
[03:03:30]  Fight back  And we always hear about the nose  Is that because that's a sensitive area on the shark?  Well, because the nose has not only the nostrils  It's the only place you can hit  Oh, yeah  What are we going to hit him in the tail?  Kidney shot  He's eating your leg  So go ahead and strike it  Really, you're in a survival mode  So a survival mode  As is the case in any kind of wild animal attack  You guys don't understand what's going on here  They're doing a whole report on how to protect yourself from sharks  Maybe 20 people are going to have to use this  Chemical ones and electrical ones 
[03:04:00]  She should be shot to the face  Do you think that's going to do any good?  Certainly, yeah  Most of the shark repellents under development right now  Are still under development  They're being tested  Yeah, it's called land  But there is some promising avenues that the researchers are going down  Again, most of these repellents are used for commercial divers  For people who are in the water much more frequently  They're not geared up toward the regular swimmer  So they may not be applicable right away for the average person going to the beach  Sharks can detect prey hundreds of yards away  If you do see a shark, don't panic 
[03:04:30]  Eight shark attacks in Florida this year  They're flashing this on the screen  In red background  Red background, white letters  Any other thing in the water, right?  So it's not like they're coming after us  You just have to be  I swear to God  I hope she fucking drops them  They love this shit  Sharks don't want to eat people  It's a case of mistaken  No, no, they do  Don't say that  You're not scaring them enough  In very, very rare instances  So best thing to do  Is not worry about swimming with sharks  They're all around us at any given time  And don't panic 
[03:05:00]  All right, Greg  Well, thank you very much for that vital information  Thank you, Robin  Vital  We sure do appreciate it  Thanks a lot  He was saying how it's not a problem  How this is so rare, don't worry about it  And she had to keep adding in these little points  To make it sound scarier  Unbelievable  You want vital information?  How about this?  In case your car might break down  Don't drive near Bedford-Stuyvesant or Brownsville  There you go  That's vital information  Vital information to your safety  According to the International Shark Attack File 
[03:05:30]  Between 1580 and 2003  1580?  1580 and 2003  Dude, that's like Vikings  Right, Vikings  You're talking Vikings  So you had to go to the beach  With that wacky skull cap with the horns  Whatever you want to call it  The Viking hat  Viking hat  There were 1,909 confirmed shark attacks around the world  Around the world 
[03:06:00]  Since 1580  You know how many people have lived since 1580?  Since 1580  There have been 38 deaths in the United States  Since 1580  That's it?  38 deaths  It wasn't in the United States until 1776, Anthony  Yeah, I know  Ooh  Australia is at 132  And they're top in the list  Europe with one  One little shark attack that killed somebody  They're so white the sharks can't see them in the water 
[03:06:30]  And how about Bermuda?  How about Bermuda?  Four attacks since 1580  Resulting in no deaths  No one in Bermuda has died from a shark attack  Since 1580  Bermuda's gonna have to do better  Yeah  They just did a whole report on how to protect yourself from shark attacks  Knowing that maybe another 20 people  Will get bit by a shark this year  Yeah 
[03:07:00]  Maybe  Here it is  Maybe  I wanted to sail a softball  Run into her perfect capped teeth  She was making me physically ill  Here it is  In 1996  That's the only year I have for this  There were 18 reported injuries and deaths from shark attacks  18 injuries and deaths from shark attacks  In Florida?  But there were 199,000 injuries from working with screws, nails, tacks and bolts 
[03:07:30]  140,000 injuries from ladders  44,000 injuries from toilets  Where's the news special on toilet danger?  That's right  44,000 injuries from toilets  How to protect yourself from your own toilet  Are there logs in your neighborhood?  How not to sit on your testicles?  We'll tell you at 11  You don't want that to happen 
[03:08:00]  You fall down a little close to the front and almost sit on your ball bag  And 35,000 injuries while pruning, trimming or edging plants  That's why we do the assaults on the media  Yep  No respect whatsoever  None whatsoever  We're not buying into their culture of fear  Wow  Alright, New York City  Is that here?  New York City reporting the following number of people bitten by dogs 
[03:08:30]  8,064  Bitten by other people  1,587  People are doing more biting than dogs?  Well, no, dogs were 8,000  Oh, 8,000  People were 1,500  Oh, I'm sorry  Cats, 800  Rats, 300  Squirrels, 100  Raccoons, 11  Ferrets, 7  Skunks, 3  And there were 13 shark injuries reported nationwide the same year  So, where's the other people danger? 
[03:09:00]  The bitten by people  God, they really are scumbags  They love scaring people, building things up  And this is just one little thing that is, you know, obvious to us  Look at all the other stories  This is what they do for a living  It's not about giving you the news  It's not about the news anymore  It's about ratings, sensationalism, and scaring the piss out of you  So, you tune in more, you watch more, you're concerned for your safety 
[03:09:30]  It's always about your safety  You have to watch this, or you might be injured  That's what the news is now  Didn't they used to be like  I heard when JFK got shot  The reporter said to the candidates  Like, look, whenever you're ready to make a statement, we're here  They showed them some respect and some privacy  And it's like, back then, didn't they have a little bit more dignity  Or self-respect or integrity?  Like, what happened that just turned them into these fucking vultures?  I'll tell you what happened  Money  Well, money, certainly  But the competition got greater, obviously  More channels and stuff back then 
[03:10:00]  And what, we had three news channels?  Yeah  Yeah, it was pretty much your networks  You had the news  The news wasn't all day, by the way  If something happened  Unless it was a big event that they cut into television for  You waited until 6 o'clock  Or 5 o'clock to get your news  That was it  You had your, whatever  TV that went up to channel 13  A lot of those channels did nothing  And the other ones were your networks  So you tune in the news 
[03:10:30]  The morning news  And then the evening news  And then the late news  That was it  Coming up  Women in danger  What is this now?  Women in danger?  Coming up  Vampires among us?  I shit you not  New book everyone's talking about  Ahead  It says vampires among us  With a question mark  Nosferatu they're showing  Dude, and they were showing  Nosferatu  I shit you not, people  We just read that on the news  Women in danger?  With a question mark  And then vampires among us? 
[03:11:00]  What?  Are they listening to this show  And now they're fucking with us?  Because that can't be real  That cannot be real  While we're having this conversation  It did not just say  Vampires among us  Oh my dear sweet lord  They'll interview those  Cornbow vampire people  Who hang out  And think they're dark and gothic  I guarantee that's what  They're going to do  I'm a vampire  I really am  I like blood  I am just stupefied at this  And then we get these  Articles in the paper  About us and our  Assaults on the media  Yeah, while a news reporter 
[03:11:30]  Is doing a story on rape  Why are these guys behind?  Do these news people  Have any dignity left at all  Where we can't go up  And just shake our cocks  Behind them  What dignity do these guys have  That anything we do  Behind a newscaster  Means anything  Can you picture Cronkite  Reading that tease?  Vampires among us  Vampires among us  Tune in at 5 o'clock  When I'll do a story  On vampires  Holy shit  I covered the Tet Offensive 
[03:12:00]  Now I'm doing vampires  Holy shit  Women in danger  Of vampires  Shark vampires  Swimming off the waters  In our area  Unbelievable  I can't believe  I just saw  Vampires among us  Classic  With that red background  That alert red background  With the white lettering  On it  Where you can't miss it  Even in your peripheral vision  If you're walking  Through your living room  And there's a TV  You gotta look and go  There's some kind of danger  I need to be alerted to 
[03:12:30]  These scumbags  Please let's get more  Of them fired  Please  Please get them fired  You know it really  Should be a mission  Now there's so many  News channels  That it's so competitive  That a guy  In a suit  Sitting behind a desk  With four clocks  Behind him  Just doesn't cut it anymore  The American public  Will not watch that  They want  They want action  They want it to be  Like an action movie  They want excitement 
[03:13:00]  They want danger  But not real danger  Just this perceived danger  Don't put me in danger  Tell me about the danger  I'm in  The sad part  The majority of the viewers  Can't decipher  What's real and what's not  And what's  Oh exactly  Yeah  You know they can't  Figure it out  That a lot of this  Is sensationalism  Yeah  When you're close  To the media  As we have been  You do realize  How much they get wrong  How phony it is  And how much  They're doing things  For ratings  But yeah  99% of the American public  Forget about it 
[03:13:30]  They eat this shit up  And go  Oh do you hear  It's water cooler talk  They love it  The news loves spreading  This shit around  Where they know  People are going to go to work  You hear about the shark attacks  Yeah  Well I'm going to the beach  This weekend  Well I saw  Don't wear jewelry  Don't go out and splash  Don't wear a fucking seal suit  Watch out for the vampires  They're out there too  If you're having your period  Wear sunblock  I saw it  If you're having your period  Don't go in the water  Yeah who  That'll attract the sharks  Well  That's probably true  You know how many girls  Are having their periods  At any given fucking moment  That's probably true  Just because it grosses me out  If I'm swimming around 
[03:14:00]  Some big bloodstains  These parents have enough  To worry about at the beaches  And now they have it  In the back of their mind  This fear as well now  Yeah  Yeah  Look at how the shark  Some guy is diddling  Your eight year old  Yeah where's that danger  The little bathing suit  Let's go to Bob in Jersey  Bob let's go  Hey how you doing  Hey  How about the news  Does something useful  Like how to protect your jeep  From Swoogies  There you go  Watch out  There you go  I would still have  An XM satellite radio  In my car

[03:15:00]  Hey Dave  Hey Ant  Wasn't 1882  You and Groucho  Used to go to the beach  And that's when you  Started keeping track of that  Yes  Me and Groucho  On the beach  Let's go to Ryan  In Florida  Hey  Hey  Hey what's going  I love you guys  Doesn't teen shark attack  Sound a hell of a lot  Next year  Than fat lady shark attack  Of course it does  Teen shark attack  Very sexy  Alright thank you  Anyway punch it out  Let's go to Dr. D in Indiana  Hey good morning 
[03:15:30]  Two headlines in local paper  Local authorities try to weed out pot problem  Another headline  Is your dog's liver in danger from radio DJs  Very good  Weed out the problem  Yeah  Yeah well  At 6 o'clock  This is sticky in Louisiana  At 6 o'clock  Horseshoe crabs  Hidden menace  They love using lines like that too  That's a great news line 
[03:16:00]  Hidden menace  A danger  Oh it's always so  So dangerous out there  Just to step out your fucking door in the morning  It's such a danger  Tom what's going on  What's up guys  Hey this weekend  My car was broken into  They stole my XM  I was within 100 miles from you  Do you think we should launch an investigation  Yeah exactly  Only 100 miles away  Boy  Only 100 miles away  They stole my radio  Let's call the media 
[03:16:30]  They actually said that  The latest attack  Only 100 miles away  You know how long it would take you  To swim 100 miles  Yeah  You fucking assholes  You know how long it takes you  To swim 100 miles  On Long Island on a Friday  Exactly  Fucking retards  Alright let's go to another Tom  Tom  Yeah how you doing  Hey  Hey Al  What I want to do  Is take some of these reporters  That report how many sharks  Down on the beaches  Home into the water  Because they can see  What the real hidden danger is  Like the riptides  That killed more people in a year  Than have been killed by sharks  Since 1882 
[03:17:00]  Another interesting stat  Two people die each year  From death by soda machines  I can't even figure out  How that could possibly happen  I'm guessing you try to  Shake it loose  And it falls on you  Yeah  Justly falls on you  Do you think that  When you're killed like that  Your family goes  Please God  Let there be one other person  In this country  Who died this way  Yeah  So we're not related  To the only asshole  There's two  They could put him to rest 
[03:17:30]  With a little smile  On their face  Because yes  There are two per year  I guess that is the only way  You can die from a soda machine  I can't really imagine  Any other way  The can comes flying out  And hits you in the head  Was that a Stephen King movie  Some sort of an electricity thing  Maybe you're standing in water  And you go to  But that would probably be  An electrical death  But that's really  A soda machine death  Well  Maybe the change return  Shoots a quarter  Into your pee hole  Right  That could hurt  Yeah that would just hurt though 
[03:18:00]  Change shooting into your pee hole  Are there soda machines  In your neighborhood  A soda machine danger  You haven't heard about  Are your children  Near soda machines  Jeff in Chicago  Hey what's up  Hey Jeff  Hey I wanted to know  How many people  Have died fucking  And you know  If it's probably more  Why on the news  Don't we hear  You know  Them telling us  Not to fuck  Real hot Puerto Rican shit 
[03:18:30]  Even though the joke  Went horribly wrong  I think  You do have a good point  About  It's just  I'm not a pro man  I'm just  Call her you know  Alright  Thank you Jeff  Here's a  Biggest headline  Here in Tampa  Is shoot out  At the airport  Turns out to be  A guy shot his ex-wife  In the parking lot  And got shot by a cop  And the teaser  Makes it sound like  It's some kind of  Terrorist attack  They only say  Shoot out at the airport 
[03:19:00]  Of course  Because they love  Especially with the terrorist  Anything that happens  With an airplane  Or an airport  They love giving you  As little information  And as much fear as possible  For to listen to  Opie and Anthony  Is more good  Than to work  In the fruit roll up factory  Making the fruit roll up  When I was in Russia  We work and make things  That's so much better  Than your American  Because I  You know  What do you  Let me just 
[03:19:30]  Well you already know  But  You don't want to work  Work good for you  Right  Why you don't want to work  I was farting  So bad  And it stunk so bad  You fat American  Right  Russia is so much better  Than you my friend  I think that would be  Something that maybe  People should  Need to know  Okay  Back to work  XM 202  The Opie and Anthony show  Mike Tyson  Always fun  Mike Tyson  I guess he was in trouble  For jumping on the hood 
[03:20:00]  Of a car  And scaring some people  And of course  We commented on that  Well we also I think  Had Mike Tyson stop by  To spell words and stuff  Yeah  How about that  How about that  Jimmy  Yeah nothing more else  To say  Nothing else more  To say  Nothing more else  It's okay  What  No farts from Jimmy  This segment  Jimmy  Anything  They're ready to start the bid  Look  Scared  They're ready to push play  Opie

[03:23:30]  You had to sell your tigers too  Yeah I gotta sell everything  I'm broke  Well they're saying  I've been hanging with the wrong niggas  You were arrested last night  On suspicion of misdemeanor criminal damage  For allegedly jumping on the hood of a car  Outside of a city nightclub  Allegedly  What's the story there Mike  That well it's allegedly  Which means I might not have done it  But I did  You did do it right  Yeah  He frightened me  Aren't there signs in this amusement park 
[03:24:00]  That says do not roll windows down  While driving through Lion Country Safari  Yeah  Well  You know they rolled the window down  They taunted Mike with a little treat  So I jumped up on his hood  And ripped off his windshield wiper  They snapped some pictures and laughed  Lucky there wasn't in a convertible  Convertible  Yeah  R  No  Nine  And the symbol for Mercury  Even close 
[03:24:30]  And they're saying you dented the hood of this car  Well look at me  Of course I dented it  Yeah but you didn't see what happened after  Were you jumping up and down like it was luggage  Yeah I was jumping up and down  Like he was driving a piece of Samsonite luggage  But that's nothing compared to what I did after  Afterwards you know what I did  I jumped through subway tracks  And picked up a big subway train  And cracked it open and ate some of the people inside 
[03:25:00]  No  Then I grabbed a hot blonde  And I climbed up the Empire State Building  And swatted at some biplane  That wasn't you  That was King Kong  I went  And they  Rattatatat started shooting me  And then I fell all the way down to the sidewalk  And then some guy came over and said  T'was beauty killed the beast  Beauty  How do you spell beauty?  Beauty  F  No 
[03:25:30]  C  And the logo for XM Satellite Radio  Beauty  Well there's more details here  You were leaving a nightclub at 1am  I was?  Yes  Okay  And this car stopped to let you cross the street  And all of a sudden you decided to start screaming and yelling at the guy  And then you jumped on the hood of this guy's car  On your hands and knees and began to pound on it  You see how I pounced? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah  I was trying to impress a female of my species across the street  So I pounced up and down and grabbed bushes and throw them  You got one of those nice big red asses to show off  I show my teeth in my big red mandrel ass  As I jumped around  Yeah that gets the ladies  They didn't say you know  No newspapers reported what he was doing that annoyed Mike so much  You know he sounded like he was just driving 
[03:26:30]  But his buddies was pissing me off  What?  Why?  They were following behind me  Taking plastic casts of my footprints  And selling them  What is Sasquatch?  I've never heard such terms  Sasquatch  B-R-U-L-C-P��  You don't even have to attempt to spell that one  No  Print page  Print page?  I'm spelling  On a typewriter  Isn't that how it done? 
[03:27:00]  Well okay  L-O-Y  Shift  All right.  More info here, Mike.  I don't know how much more info Mike's brain could take.  Well, the valet who witnessed this said that you were intoxicated  and you were falling over and slurring as you were crossing the street.  But that wasn't Mike's fault.  Everybody thinks Mike's fault that I was slurring my speech and falling down.  But minutes earlier, a Land Rover pulled up and fired a dart into Mike's neck. 
[03:27:30]  And that's why I was weaving.  And I would look, I'm still walking around with a tag on my ear and a radio collar on.  That's how they keep tabs on me.  But that's why I was drowsy.  You would too if you had a dart full of tranquilizer in your neck.  That's why I was not intoxicated.  I was drugged for a medical experiment.  Experiment.  Oh, no.  F.  P.  Or R. 
[03:28:00]  Control, escape, delete.  All right, whatever you say, sure.  Experiment.  And finally, they're saying you're beginning to train for a fight.  Do you know about this?  No.  I've got to fight again.  You're going to be fighting in March.  Mike don't want to get his ass kicked no more.  I have to train for a fight?  You're training for a fight, yeah.  The training starts early.  First, they paper trained me so I could go into the kitchen on the papers.  And then it starts from there.  And then perhaps soon I could live inside in the house. 
[03:28:30]  And I have to live in the Mike house out back where all my feces litter the yard.  That's, you know, we've got to train early.  You know, it's kind of a, that's the first step in training.  Then I could come inside and maybe they will pet Mike and let him sleep at the foot of the bed.  I am not an animal.  I am Mike Tyson.  Well, Mike, we have some instant feedback coming in here. 
[03:29:00]  And Gravy Eggos from the Pacific Ocean writes.  Gravy Eggos?  Uh-oh.  He's checking in from the Pacific Ocean.  Yes, I wonder what he's going to talk about.  Yeah, I wonder.  I effing wonder.  Just please make me understand.  I'm going to be that little guy.  He wants to know if Tyson punched Lacey Peterson in the stomach and then wonder where her uterus went. 
[03:29:30]  Now, that would have solved the problem, wouldn't it?  That boy wouldn't have had to go fishing.  If I punched, there would be nothing left.  That's what I used to do to my ex-wife, the one from head of the class.  What was that bitch's name?  Robin Givens?  Robin Quivers?  Robin Givens?  I would like to punch her in her big fat fucking face.  Robin Givens?  Givens.  Oh, that's a different one.  Yeah.  I'd like to punch her too. 
[03:30:00]  I was married to her and remember I punched her in the face during an argument and in an interview I said it was the best punch I ever gave.  And she took it.  I miss her.  You miss Robin.  I'd like a bitch who could take a punch to the uterus.  I miss that.  Yeah, any more details?  I'm looking.  On my rampage?  I'm looking. 
[03:30:30]  I think that's about it.  The guy, he just wants his hood fixed.  He doesn't even really want to press charges.  He just wants his hood fixed that you did when you were jumping up and down on all fours.  I don't have that kind of scratch.  What are you doing, Mike?  Fourteen, not...  What?  What were you just doing?  Oh, I was...  Sometimes I make that noise.  I think I got Tourette's.  Yeah?  Yes, right in the middle of the talking. 
[03:31:00]  Right in the middle of the talking.  Right in the middle of the talking.  Sometimes I bust out like that and I get on all fours and something else and on car hoods.  Oh, look, I'm on the TV.  Yeah.  Well...  What is that mysterious box with a picture in it?  That's the TV.  Yeah, I shouldn't have said TV first.  I know.  The joke would have...  It would have worked.  Sometimes I don't think so straight. 
[03:31:30]  I got brain damage.  Brain.  Oh?  Well, it's in there.  C.  T.  That's a hard one.  All right, Mike.  Well, thank you.  Well, thank you.  No, thank you.  I'll see you down in the parking garage.  Any blonde woman in this city, on maybe the 60th floor, I could shove my big fish through 
[03:32:00]  the window, grab and climb buildings?  No?  I like that.  They go, ah!  They start screaming.  I climb up the building with them.  I tickle them a little peek under their dress.  They charge me with rape and then the biplane shoot me.  That's a night out for Mike.  All right, well, I want to thank...  Oh, phone call's coming in.  Anthony, you just missed Mike Tyson.  He was...  Oh, I did.  ...giving us an exclusive on his arrest overnight. 
[03:32:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  American badass.  Kid Rock.  Our buddy, our pal.  Oh.  Oh, what happened to my music?  We were jamming, man.  We were rocking.  I like that.  Anthony, breaking news.  We got Linda Lovelace's daughter...  Daughter?  No.  Sister.  I'm sorry.  Sister on the phone.  Barbara Borman.  There's a very tragic story in the New York papers about Linda Lovelace, right?  Yeah, she died. 
[03:33:00]  She died, which is very sad.  Mm-hmm.  We're huge fans of porno.  I know.  Oh, stop it.  Well, I know later in life...  I know the whole story.  We'll get into it with Linda Lovelace's sister.  You know, later on in life, she didn't want anything to do with that.  We understand all that.  Even at the time, it seems that, you know, there were things going on that she wasn't  very happy with what she was doing.  Right.  Well, the papers are reporting that they don't have enough money to bury Linda Lovelace.  Yeah.  See?  Because I said something stupid, right?  See?  I knew it, Opie. 
[03:33:30]  Oh.  What did I say?  You can't say we're big fans of porno.  I knew she would hang up.  Very sensitive about that.  Very.  But then I, like, kind of correct to myself real fast.  No, no.  That was enough.  Oh.  The way that family is, and the sister, forget about it.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you...  Oh.  Oh.  I knew it.  That's why I was completely, like, playing like...  Why don't we play...  Why don't we do our little trick that we do? 
[03:34:00]  I don't know.  That ain't gonna work.  Oh.  That ain't gonna work.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  The big one that got away.  Oh.  The big one that got away.  Oh.  We were gonna pay for a funeral, man.  I know.  Jesus.  Well, let's just wait.  Oh, wait.  She's back.  Barbara.  Barbara.  Hello.  Hi.  Are you mad at us?  I am not interested in speaking about Linda Lovelace and the pornography. 
[03:34:30]  Okay.  That's fair enough.  Well, I heard a little laugh, and it upsets me.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There was no one laughing.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, we laugh at stupid things, but we weren't laughing.  No, nothing like that.  I'm very familiar with the story, as a matter of fact.  We were just trying to explain to people who she was.  That's all.  Yeah.  We understand the family's stance on this whole thing.  That she was basically assaulted.  That's how that amounted to.  The woman did not want to do this, and she was taken advantage of and spent the rest of 
[03:35:00]  her life as an advocate for people put in the same situation.  Yes, she did.  And now she just recently died on Monday, I guess.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  And it was three weeks after a car accident.  She had a horrific car accident.  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened?  It seems like, I think, a tie rod, it's under investigation.  It seems that I was told that the tie rod broke and her seatbelt broke.  The car rolled over three or four times, and she was thrown about 38 feet out of the windshield. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, Jesus.  She broke both legs, shattered elbow, and pelvis was broken.  Now, she was in, I guess, financial straits here, it seems.  She died penniless.  Penniless.  And if you would like to have people send to a fund that's being sent up for her, I can  give you that information.  Well, how much does a funeral cost?  I have no idea. 
[03:36:00]  You have no idea?  No.  Uh-huh.  And what do you need money for?  Because we would like to...  It's not me.  It's what's been set up for her grandchildren.  Oh.  Oh, see, it sounded like they...  Because we're reading Linda Lovelace, kin, can't afford her burial.  Well, my father's out there to help her.  Oh, okay.  Well, we kind of wanted to pay for the funeral for the gal.  Well, that's pretty darn nice.  Well, so you have enough money to bury her? 
[03:36:30]  Honey, I'm in Florida.  I don't...  I'm not there, and I don't want to go there.  Oh, why not?  Because I'd rather remember the way she was and the wonderful times we had together.  My father is there.  Right.  And her son is coming home.  He's due in tonight.  He's in the National Guard.  And his daughter is there, too.  I mean, her daughter.  Is it that you don't have the means to go, or you just would rather not go? 
[03:37:00]  Both.  You know, it's pretty expensive to go out, and I'm just going to stay home and breathe  with myself.  There you go.  Do you...  In my heart, I feel better right here.  Do you have any...  Has anyone had any contact with that first husband of hers?  What?  That idiot?  Yeah.  Chuck Traynor?  Yeah, yeah.  That guy.  No one has had any contact with him.  No one?  And no one is trying to... 
[03:37:30]  He hasn't tried to contact anybody now that she's died?  I'm sure not.  Interesting.  Any memories of Linda Lovelace you'd like to share with our audience this afternoon, Barbara?  As my youngest sister, she was my baby doll.  I was 16 when she was born.  She was a beautiful little girl.  A very happy little girl.  And then all hell broke loose.  But she and I were always very close.  Yeah.  And I wish to remember the memories of that. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  And I can give you a call out there.  Want to help with expenses or what?  Yeah, we would like to do something nice for Linda Lovelace.  Opie.  Yes.  We would.  So what is...  A fund is being set up.  Yes.  And this fund is for?  Linda Lovelace Memorial Fund. 
[03:38:30]  A fund is going to be set up in lieu of flowers into an account for her grandchildren's college fund.  Right.  And, well, now here's another tip here.  Her funeral expenses are being covered.  Oh, they are?  They are.  They are.  I'm just reading my notes from her sister-in-law.  Her first...  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  What do you call a check?  Oh, good.  So...  She was on disability and it came the day after she died.  But anyway, she has a sister-in-law out there who's handling all of this and doing very well.  But she has said that people are calling her and wanting to donate and so on.  Yeah.  So if you want to, I give you the account number, the name of the bank...  Well, we shouldn't, you know, have that kind of information put out on the air, I don't think.  But is there a phone number, perhaps, or somewhere where people might be able to get in touch and send a donation? 
[03:39:30]  Are you okay?  You can send a donation to me and I can forward it.  Okay.  If you want to, that's entirely up to you.  Right.  Well, um...  I can give you the...  The name of the bank.  The name of the bank.  Yeah, let's give out the name of the bank.  If you're just tuning in, Linda Lovelace died tragically in a car accident on Monday. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, and we're just...  There's a fund.  And we got Barbara on the phone, her loving sister.  You're the older sister?  Yes, I am.  Ah.  We lost another 14 years ago.  Anyway, are you ready for this?  Uh, yes, yes.  All right.  Andrew, you owe me $1,000.  Yes.  It's Wells Fargo Bank.  Okay.  In Anglewood, Colorado.  Okay.  Barbara, you all right?  I'm all right.  Yeah.  Cindy, where's the account number?  Is this it?  Yes. 
[03:40:30]  Okay.  The account number is...  Oh, Hunter.  Okay.  And I want to thank everybody from coast to coast, north and south, who have called here  and their condolences.  Right.  And she was a lovely girl.  I bet, Barbara.  Barbara, well, thank you so much for spending a few minutes with us today and giving us a  little remembrance of Linda. 
[03:41:00]  And she was advocating, I wish you could have heard her speeches.  They were unbelievable.  Yeah.  And she did a great job.  Mm, take it in my mouth.  You know.  Yeah.  She'll be a legend.  I bet.  I bet.  Well, best of luck to you, Barbara.  Thank you very much.  I think Barbara really needs to give out that account number again.  Do you think...  Do we get it?  Just the account number once again.  One more time.  All right.  I'm sorry, Barbara.  That's okay. 
[03:41:30]  Penises.  Penises.  Okay.  Thank you very much, Barbara.  Okay.  Thank you for calling.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Where do I hand in my membership card to the human race?  Do I just burn it, or do I have to turn it back in?  Do I have to turn it in?  Do I have to give it to somebody?  Or do I just wait for it to expire?  Holy Jesus!  That was awful.
