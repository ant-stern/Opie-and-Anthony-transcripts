<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a recent snowstorm, contrasting the city and county's snow removal efforts and mocking news reporters' dramatic coverage.  This transitioned into a critique of Bill Maher's stance on gun control. A substantial portion focused on Ted Williams, the former homeless man who gained fame for his voice.  The hosts dissected his arrest following an altercation with his daughter, speculating on a relapse and the negative influence of those who profited from his success.  The death of the Browning Pool singer was also briefly discussed, alongside a listener calling in from Connecticut regarding the heavy snowfall.  The hosts played audio clips of Ted Williams and his daughter recounting the incident and briefly mentioned the "Frankie Blue" incident. Throughout this segment, the hosts used highly offensive and misogynistic, homophobic, and racist language.

The show then shifted to the aftermath of the Arizona shooting and the ensuing political debate, criticizing what they perceived as hypocritical and partisan reactions from both sides of the political spectrum. Opie shared frustrations with political correctness and censorship, detailing his struggles with international adoption.  He expressed strong dislike for Bill Maher again, engaging in a critical analysis of Chris Matthews' commentary on Sarah Palin and the "crosshairs" imagery, arguing against the interpretation that it incited violence.  Opie recounted a phone conversation with Ron Bennington and Fez Whatley about gun control and the responsibility of ammunition sellers, disagreeing vehemently with Fez's comparison to serving alcohol to a drunk driver.  They played an audio clip of Chris Matthews' monologue and received a supportive call from a listener.  Further discussion touched upon the media’s fear-mongering and exploitation of tragedy for political gain. A song about the Arizona shooter was played, followed by discussions of other news items, including a video of Hillary Clinton falling and celebrity birthdays.  The latter half of this segment featured a studio interview with Armie Hammer, who discussed his role in *The Social Network*, the technical aspects of portraying the Winklevoss twins, his experiences meeting the real twins and Trent Reznor, and the film's themes and reception.

The interview with Armie Hammer continued into the next segment, beginning with the hosts discussing a former girlfriend's unusual Trent Reznor fetish and transitioning to Sean Parker's involvement in Napster.  Hammer discussed his upcoming role in *J. Edgar*, speculating humorously with the hosts about J. Edgar Hoover's alleged homosexuality. He detailed his acting career, mentioning roles in *Gossip Girl* and *Reaper*, described Clint Eastwood's directing style, and shared anecdotes about his family background and his parents' initial reluctance regarding his acting career.  Rumors about a potential Superman role were also discussed.  Comedian Amy Schumer then joined the show.  The hosts replayed a humorous anecdote from a previous guest, Jay Mohr, about Clint Eastwood, followed by discussions of Jim Norton's upcoming CD and Amy Schumer's projects. Schumer discussed her current film role and rehearsals with Parker Posey.  The segment concluded with audio clips from a Boston city official's speech, punctuated by host banter about a mistakenly played data disc, and a conversation with Amy Schumer regarding her dating life and sexual experiences.

The final segment featured Amy Schumer discussing a nude photoshoot for Cosmopolitan magazine, detailing the location and the varying degrees of nudity in the photos. The hosts and Schumer engaged in humorous commentary on the photos and potential viewer reactions.  The conversation shifted to Schumer's stand-up career and her use of appearance to attract audiences.  Discussions about other comedians, including Joe DeRosa, followed, with graphic and humorous descriptions of their physiques.  The topic moved to body hair preferences, featuring graphic descriptions and jokes about waxing.  A significant portion was dedicated to a heated debate about Bill Maher’s political views and commentary on gun control, featuring highly offensive language and strong opinions on gun rights, the Second Amendment, and the role of rhetoric in political discourse. Specific examples of Maher's statements were played and discussed, along with counterpoints and opinions on the NRA.  The show concluded with plugs for Schumer's upcoming shows and an absurd segment called "Adventures in Docking," discussing a caller's sexual experience and subsequent urologist visit.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts frequently used highly offensive and misogynistic, homophobic, and racist language.

Get your asses out there and make sure I see blacktop today.  Do you think he did that or he screwed up last time and thought, oh, I better make sure everything runs smooth this time. 
[00:05:00]  I think it was his fault last time.  His fault this time.  My stupid opinion on the whole thing.  It was a little work slowdown, which happens from time to time.  I don't even blame the boys.  If they feel like they're not getting what they deserve, you do some things that you can't really prove.  No one can really prove it.  He's a vulture.  He tried to look like a peacock this time.  He's an ass. 
[00:05:30]  I hate him.  Did you see the dump trucks right outside this building?  They're not fucking around.  There's blacktop outside our building right now.  It was a conga line of trucks.  The side streets are all plowed already.  Everything's done.  Everything is completely plowed.  And I know the storm isn't as bad as the one we had right after Christmas, but still, it's very obvious that all the trucks are out there working their asses off.  Yeah.  Very obvious.  So I don't know what was said. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know what's different, but something is definitely different between the two storms.  Long Island got hit a little harder.  I noticed leaving a lot of snow where I was.  And then the second I crossed over into Queens, like the street, the Cross Island Parkway.  Right.  That separates Nassau from Queens.  Which is officially the city.  Yeah.  The second I crossed over, completely wet streets.  That's the city's responsibility. 
[00:06:30]  But Nassau County, yeah, snow, you know, you have to trudge through, like you have to watch driving.  It's kind of fun, though.  There is a fun thing about driving in the snow, especially early in the morning when no one else is on the road really.  Yeah.  A couple of people.  You kind of push the turns a little.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh, I'm sliding a little.  It's just kind of fun.  I'll let off the gas.  But nothing wrong with sliding a little bit.  Yeah, it's kind of fun driving in the snow.  Especially if you've got a nice snow truck like you've got.  I think, yeah, when you have a big four-wheel drive thing. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  But I think everybody, they bitch about the snow, but I think everybody kind of likes the adventure of, like, I've got to go out.  I've got to drive in it.  It's kind of exciting.  It's different.  It takes away from the mundane commute of every day.  I liked it.  It was fun.  It's easy, though.  But these stupid fucking news people, enough already.  They just showed a shot of, what's her name?  Carolyn Gusshoff.  Yeah, she worked at News 12 on Long Island, and now she's been in.  I don't know what that is, News 12. 
[00:07:30]  I got the Fios.  You got the Fios.  What is that?  News 12?  It used to be a little news channel out there.  Cablevision told me I wasn't going to get it if I switched.  Before Fios decided to compete with all the cable outlets.  Damn, I'm missing out.  But she's in the big time now.  She's in the Big Apple doing her thing.  Yeah.  And they just showed her on the street doing her snow coverage, and she's saying that there's white-out conditions.  And, man, it was a crystal clear picture of not only her, but you could probably see a mile behind her.  A mile behind her.  There wasn't a hint of fucking white-outs. 
[00:08:00]  She had one of those turtleneck-y things.  She's like, it's really windy out here, and she's trying to, like, kind of squint her eyes slightly.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Nothing was happening.  The storm is pretty much a bust for us in this area, because Kevin from Connecticut's like, fuck you guys.  It's up to eight.  Oh, Connecticut's fucked.  Yeah, he said it's 18 inches so far.  Wow, still going?  Yeah.  Connecticut got the brunt of it.  They got hit.  New England's going to get hit with this thing.  North Shore, Long Island, really got a good blast of it, too.  Right.  Connecticut really getting hammered.  But New York, she wasn't there. 
[00:08:30]  She wasn't in Connecticut.  She was out on Long Island.  She was out on Long Island.  I was trying to say there's whiteout conditions, as it was a beautiful shot.  Yeah, snow was coming down really nice.  When I left, when I walked out of my house, I actually looked and went like, well, this is nice.  You know, the snow's coming straight down.  It's not going sideways.  It's a basic snowstorm.  It was nice.  It's fine.  And most of the kids are going to have to go to school in our area.  New York City, no schools closed.  Go fuck yourselves, kids.  Really?  None closed?  No, Uncle Paul.  Feel free to go. 
[00:09:00]  But how they cover this shit on the news, it's just ridiculous.  They need something.  What are they going to do now?  Because they were counting on their snow coverage all day.  Their snow, what do they call it?  Apocalypse?  Snow.  Snowpocalypse.  Snowpocalypse.  Stormpocalypse.  Blizzpocalypse.  Right.  They don't have that today, so they're going to have to maybe.  They don't.  But they'll still go with it.  They'll still go with it and try to make it into something it's not.  Because they sent all their people out to the locations, so they have to go to them. 
[00:09:30]  And then those people have to over-dramatize what's going on.  Carolyn Gustav, she had that turtleneck thing, that scarf-like wrap around her neck, and it  was around her mouth.  Well, that's because she's getting older.  She's trying to hide some stuff.  Oh, is that the waddle?  Yeah.  She's got to hide the waddle?  She's hiding the waddle and some other things that are starting to go on.  Because it sure as shit wasn't because of the wind that she was talking about.  Nothing was blowing.  Women get fucked when they age.  Sorry.  Sorry for that.  That waddle, ladies.  Not good.  That wasn't our doing. 
[00:10:00]  Damn.  That was God's doing.  Morning, Danny.  Atlanta is shut down, huh?  Let's go to Brad in Atlanta.  Brad!  Morning, boys.  Third day straight.  The city's fucked.  Nobody can get in or out of anything.  Can we have the airport open, Brad?  I'm working on it, Ant.  See, that's fast times.  How many inches did you get?  One?  We got like four inches, but the problem is...  Oh, wow.  Shit.  Atlanta, look out.  That's my favorite part of snow coverage, when you hear an inch of snow shuts down cities. 
[00:10:30]  What's wrong with you people?  Ice.  Hey, at least it's white.  I was at Freaknik, and that was really dangerous.  Fuck the snow.  Hey, guys.  You get it?  It's a black joke.  Oh, okay.  It's the only time Atlanta's white, when it snows.  When it snows.  Jesus.  Oh, let's go to Buckhead.  Bloomberg was on vacation in Bermuda during the blizzard.  He didn't give a shit about us getting buried.  No, he didn't give a shit.  Hey, he had a little Christmas vacation like everybody else.  Fuck him.  That did have an effect on that storm, too, of course. 
[00:11:00]  Fuck him.  Fuck Bill Maher.  Fuck Bill Maher.  Oh, Bill Maher on Leno.  I thought we were going to happen.  Jay Leno is a great man.  I love Jay, but to even give Bill Maher an opportunity to blast his liberal cunt drivel that he blasted out about how people that own guns are like drug addicts.  I just had to get it out. 
[00:11:30]  I'm not going to go on it, but he can go fuck himself with his giant forehead.  His giant forehead.  I hate Bill Maher with a passion.  He fucked us over once in L.A., and I've never forgiven him.  Fuck him.  Was he blaming?  Was he blaming?  Gun owners and the NRA.  He blamed.  And rhetoric.  And Republican, conservative rhetoric. 
[00:12:00]  He blamed.  And meanwhile, he's able.  He's Mr. Free Speech.  Hey, let me say whatever the fuck I want to say on my dumbass.  No one watches it show.  And that's fine.  But the second you have an opinion that doesn't match his, it's inflammatory and bullshit.  He'd go fuck his mother.  I hate that fucking guy.  I don't get it.  Fuck Bill Maher and his ass.  Come on his big forehead.  Thank you.  It's a public service announcement.  Very good.  It's Anthony Comey.  I approve that message. 
[00:12:30]  Obviously, it's a hot topic in America right now.  It really is.  With one side, both sides just babbling without listening to each other.  It's just fucking terrific TV to watch every night.  It's great.  Everyone's trying to blame somebody else.  Meanwhile, it's just a little thing.  Now the music they're looking at is music.  That song's been out.  Ozzy.  That song's been out for years.  That guy's dead who sang it, isn't he?  Yeah.  We interviewed him in...  2000.  Was it 2000?  In Philly, dude.  Let the Bodies Hit the Floor?  That song is at least 10 years old.  And they're looking into that song. 
[00:13:00]  Really?  10 years old.  At least.  Go for it.  What's the name of the band again?  I forgot.  Browning Pool.  Browning Pool.  How old is Let the Bodies Hit the Floor?  After 9-11, it was one of the songs.  That's right.  After 9-11, it was one of the songs that the radio programmers decided shouldn't be on the radio anymore.  And it was pretty much new at that point.  So it's got to be 10, 11 years old, that song.  It's about 10 or 11 years old.  And now they're looking at the song?  Seriously?  What's wrong with you people?  For what?  Released in summer of 01.  01.  Okay.  Summer of 01.  It's just about 10 years old. 
[00:13:30]  And the lead singer of that song is dead, yes.  And he was a great guy, man.  The one time we got to hang with him, he was very, very good.  Pretty cool.  Died on his tour bus, I believe.  Drugs?  Was it the drugs?  Eh, they, you know, they...  The kid's got to get off the drugs.  Actually, I think he suffocated.  He had young pussy on his face and he suffocated.  What a way to go, though, right?  Yeah.  Was it that young?  Very young pussy.  With not even a hair to filter some air through?  Pussy was so young that they decided, let's make it look like a drug thing. 
[00:14:00]  If you got a little hair, it's like an air filter in a car.  If you got no hair, it really...  You can't breathe.  I've had to do that breathing.  You ever see when a real swimmer swims and he pulls his head up sideways and goes...  You got to come off for it.  And does that sideways breath thing.  You ever have to do that without making it look like you're doing it?  Absolutely.  Like you breathe.  And then you hold your breath a while.  And then right when they're ready to rock, you can't take a breath because you don't  want to stop the rhythm. 
[00:14:30]  And you can pretty much suffocate.  Ladies, we really go all out for you.  We figure it out, though, right?  Let me say hi to Jim in Massachusetts.  Jim, fuck you.  Yeah, Jim.  And fuck your pats.  Oh.  It's time to get pumped for this big game on Sunday.  I'm going to be at the Brigada with Jim Norton and I got to find a place to watch this  fucking game with some people.  Oh my God, that's right.  That's Sunday.  That's a big ass game, man.  Well, perhaps the suite will have a giant TV.  I'm not sure.  I want to just pick a point out what that guy called about Atlanta. 
[00:15:00]  The reason that like one inch of snow shut them down is they only have eight snow plows  for the whole city.  Really?  What do they save the rest of the vehicles for?  Water cannons?  Jesus, Ed.  You know what I mean.  What?  You know what?  I never realized that.  I guess that's why these cities shut down, because they decide, why do we need hundreds  of plows if we're only going to get snow maybe once a year?  Again, it's like Sim City.  Yeah.  You buy only things you need.  And then when a disaster happens, you go, oh shit, I'm fucked. 
[00:15:30]  That makes sense.  There's probably eight snow plows around this building right now.  Oh, yeah.  I am telling you, they are not fucking around this time.  Yeah.  Six.  They are plowing the shit out of it.  That's a major thoroughfare.  See, there you go.  The snowfall forecast, they're all over it on the TV today.  All the fuck over it.  Great.  And then they like to extend it.  Even though you know it's over, like you're driving, there's no snow left.  They go, well, we could get a few flurries, which could add to the final tally. 
[00:16:00]  Shut up.  And you go, no, it won't.  It's over.  Let's start with.  I think I see sunlight.  Shut up.  Talk about other shit now.  Yeah.  We could talk about Ted Williams.  Ted Williams.  What a hero he was in the war.  I get a great ball player.  And it's a sin that his son froze his head.  Yeah.  Where's it's.  That's not the one.  Oh, right.  If you're going to say that.  Oh, let me let me do this.  Was he a jazz singer back in the 50s?  Let me let me do this for the people. 
[00:16:30]  Hi, mommy.  Remember yesterday?  The other guy.  That's not the guy.  Hi, mommy.  The hi, mommy guy.  And remember at the end of the clip, she goes, don't disappoint me.  She said, I love you.  Don't disappoint me.  I get frustrated when people label us as just shock jocks because we know more shit than  anybody on TV.  I guarantee you that.  And we said this was probably an easier one.  I'll acknowledge that.  But we said a lot of people weren't saying it.  No one said it.  That's the difference between us and TV.  Even though this is pretty obvious, not one fucking dope on TV said, well, look, this 
[00:17:00]  guy has a real issue.  He's been on the street and he says he's clean for two years.  Now all of a sudden you're going to throw a shitload of money at him.  You're going to fly him first class to L.A.  He's meeting Kobe Bryant.  A mere week ago, he was hanging out on the streets of Columbus.  In his shit pants.  And hanging out outside Dan's place.  Dumpster diving for food.  Let's not forget Dan and the batteries and the tire store.  Dan with the battery and tire.  Love Dan.  And a week later, he's saying, hi, Kobe Bryant. 
[00:17:30]  Nice to meet you.  Cashing giant checks for doing voiceovers.  So we all say, we're like, this is going to end horribly wrong.  It's going to lose it.  And it already has begun.  The L.A. cops picked him up because he had a huge fight with his daughter.  One of his nine kids, by the way.  That he abandoned.  Nine kids.  So no one, as they're throwing the money at him and giving him the first class treatment  in these hotels and stuff, no one is acknowledging that.  Wait, this might be bad for a quote, I say quote, recovering addict.  Yeah, let's give him some money, but let's also give him some kind of maybe counseling, 
[00:18:00]  some just maybe some guidance as to how to use the money without abusing it.  Right.  And no one did that because everybody, by the way, that picked this guy up to do voiceover  and paid him, it was so self-centered.  They wanted to plug whatever the fuck they were putting him on.  Right.  And they didn't care about him, which you know what?  I don't give a shit about.  But it's not.  And you and I shouldn't have to care about him.  Matt Lauer, even though I hate Matt Lauer.  If you want to talk about people, you know, we don't like, we can get a whole list going. 
[00:18:30]  Matt Lauer shouldn't have to worry about that shit either.  But the people that grabbed this guy, his people around him, whatever it is, an agent,  a manager, whatever.  Vultures.  The vultures, I was going to say.  Yes, certainly.  They are the ones that should have went, OK, what's your issue, dude?  Yeah.  Because we got a lot of money to make here and you could fuck this thing up.  So we got to watch you really closely.  They didn't care.  Do you need to go back into a program?  Do you need a little rehab?  What are we doing here? 
[00:19:00]  What do you need?  And it's pretty obvious at this point they didn't do any of that.  They were just looking at all the paychecks that were coming in.  And we said the second he grabs money, he's going right back on the booze.  Right.  So what do we got?  We got a clip.  It was hard because when he was saying, I've got two years of sobriety, he was still outdoors  and begging.  And it was like, again, it's possible.  There's guys who are sober.  But look at Mustard.  He's already in a halfway house.  He's got like six months.  Rumor has it he had to move to Minnesota.  I want to get to the bottom of that.  Mustard?  The Mustard story continues. 
[00:19:30]  Supposedly.  Minnesota?  Minnesota, supposedly, I don't know if this person is accurate, but maybe we could.  Is it a listener?  I'll say no.  Yeah, I know.  But maybe we could try to make some calls.  But supposedly he ran out of time at that halfway house or something.  So they moved him to Minnesota.  Is that what they do?  I don't know.  I want to get to the bottom of it because that Mustard story.  You ever want to be in a halfway house?  Why would you?  I don't know.  I'll fuck it up.  Why would you want to fight for your life every night?  Be some dumpster though in the winter.  Be some outdoors.  Got to.  I do enough walking around the city. 
[00:20:00]  I know places to go if I had to.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You've been around enough to know like, yeah.  There's some warm places out there.  Would you have to fight over it though?  Would you have to fight over a great?  No, I found some places.  I got some places.  Is it a great?  A subway grill?  I got some places.  I got some shelter out there.  But the homeless have to know.  Shelter me from the pouring rain.  You are fighting for a warm place.  No, not really.  No?  The church in front of the church.  The church stairs?  No, they're all taken.  They're all taken.  They're all taken. 
[00:20:30]  Where are you going?  You got to find places that stay open all night.  That's all.  Where are you going?  I'm not saying.  Dunkin' Donuts?  You got donkeys?  Like people say it already, but I know it better than anyone that I'm a mere week or  two away from being one of those people.  I like how you're not saying it just in case.  Yes, yes.  And you're so never going to be in that position.  I got my spots.  But you have your spots.  I got my spots.  I got too many family members looking for money from me.  I might have to disappear.  Go on the lam? 
[00:21:00]  I might have to go on the lam.  Go on the lam.  And hide for a while.  I got my spots.  I wouldn't be in the elements.  I know that much.  All right.  Yeah, I searched this shit out just in case.  That's good.  What was I going to say?  Oh, no.  The homeless people we've had in, they said that they would rather live on the streets  than go in those halfway houses.  Yeah, yeah.  They're supposedly really bad.  But so Ted Williams, where were we?  Ted Williams.  Yeah, Ted got in a fight with his daughter over money.  They said it was over money.  It's one of his nine kids that he abandoned. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  And it was at the Renaissance Hotel in Los Angeles.  So what happened?  He went out to L.A. to get more fucking money.  More money.  And well, let me just read this.  This is what we know so far.  I think there's way more going on here.  And it's going to start leaking out.  Silky voice drifter held by L.A. cops.  Silky voice drifter?  Is that it?  Ted Williams, the former panhandler who became an overnight star because of his silky smooth  radio voice, was briefly detained by the L.A. PD Monday night.  Cops responded to a disturbance at the Renaissance Hotel around nine after Williams and his daughter 
[00:22:00]  got into an altercation, sources told the L.A. cops, that's a daughter going, where  the fuck have you been my entire motherfucking life?  That's what that's about.  Yeah.  And give me some money now that you're making some cash, Pops.  Williams, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, was eventually released and sources  said the investigation is ongoing.  The 53-year-old Ohio resident is in California for TV appearances.  On Monday, he visited the L.A. Lakers and met Kobe Bryant. 
[00:22:30]  This is too much for a guy that's trying to stay sober.  He drew national attention.  Yeah, we know all that.  Since then, he has received a flurry of job offers.  He's got the Kraft commercial.  And during a recent emotional reunion, Williams' 90-year-old mother, Julia Williams, had just  one request for her son.  Don't disappoint me.  Hi, Mommy.  Don't disappoint me.  Hi, Mommy.  Kraft macaroni and cheese.  My daughter's a cunt.  We got the audio that Travis just delivered. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, Travis.  Sorry.  Is it his audio resignation?  Go kick someone to the balls, dummy.  We got a Kevin from Connecticut prediction coming in on Twitter.  Kevin from CONN is what he goes by on Twitter.  He says, Ted Williams will be dead in six days.  Mark my words.  Wow.  You think it'll be that quick?  What, did he watch the videotape in the ring?  What?  That's when you die.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The ring people get you. 
[00:23:30]  Jesus Christ.  That six days is pushing it.  Six days.  I'll give him he will be in jail and not just detained, arrested and in jail within the month.  Well, see, we understand the vulture.  Yeah.  When you get to this position we're in, and I'm very appreciative.  I bitch a lot, but I'm so appreciative.  But you identify the vultures.  Yeah.  And if you don't.  You see him coming.  And if you don't, you're fucked.  Yep.  They're all over the goddamn place.  Pluck your eyes out. 
[00:24:00]  And these people that grab Ted Williams, I would bet a lot of money are not doing the  right thing by him.  I'm surprised Don King isn't on him.  Yeah, exactly.  That type of guy.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Especially radio agents and managers.  Oh, scum of the earth.  We bitch about Bob, but he's done right by us in general.  Yeah.  But there's a lot of fucking scumbags out there, big time, that just want to cash in.  Get that percentage.  So, I mean, I'm worried about this guy as far as the radio show goes.  Are you really?  As far as the radio show goes. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, okay.  When these mics are off, I could give a flying fuck about Ted Williams.  Give a shit about him.  But we got to discuss it.  Fuck him.  So, in a way, I'm worried about this guy.  Yeah, they're going to get him.  So, here's some audio.  Ted's side of the story of what happened in L.A.  No arrests were made, but here's what happened.  Around 9 p.m. last night, cops responded to a disturbance for an alleged yelling altercation  between Ted and his 29-year-old daughter, Janae.  In a new interview, Ted says it was a family gathering that got out of control.  She was being very loud and disrespectful to my voice. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, Ted.  My golden voice.  Are you golden voice, Ted?  Yes, I am.  Kraft.  There's cheese and macaroni and a whole bunch of other delicious.  Kraft.  It's only kind of fattening.  Makes you have to go doody.  It binds you up a little.  Yes, it certainly does.  You have to punch yourself.  Have some punch in the stomach to make the doody come out of Kraft.  We got our own golden voice, Ted.  Yes, you do.  Golden voice, Ted.  I like the golden oldies.  Here, I'm the virus. 
[00:25:30]  That's good.  I do that again.  Did you get that voice from...  It was a gift from God Gregory.  Okay.  Yes, I was born with a...  I'm a silky-voiced crooner.  I wasn't sure if you got it from Emporium.  Oh, my papa!  Oh, my papa!  That stinks.  Golden voice, Ted.  Yes.  They said I was going to be the next Jim Neighbors.  Get AIDS. 
[00:26:00]  My Uncle Paul, Mr. Hargis, would always say that.  I was going to be the next Jim Neighbors.  He would call me a silky-voiced crooner.  Go on there, Theodore.  Put this in your throat.  It's good for your silky voice.  Slow it to that effect.  My daughter's a cunt.  Yeah, he doesn't seem to like his daughter.  Nah, I don't think the daughter appreciated the golden voice as it's being fucking screamed. 
[00:26:30]  As she's getting screamed at.  Well, picture this.  The guy is a piece of shit.  He gets notoriety.  All indications say, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He abandoned his kids.  Nine of them.  Because of drugs and alcohol and whatnot, he decided to drop out of society and become homeless  and live in his shitty pants and eat out of a dumpster.  He, through a YouTube video, becomes famous because of his voice, gets all kinds of offers  because we love a rags-to-riches story, no matter what's behind the curtain. 
[00:27:00]  And this curtain was as thick as a rolling paper.  It's nothingness.  Everyone saw what was happening.  And then, when things start fucking up, like, less than a week later, we just love pushing him off the pedestal.  Hey, let's see him fuck up now.  That's exactly what's happening.  And his daughter is now looking at him going, oh, wow, great.  Now Dad's making some money.  You shit on us your entire life.  Gave us nothing. 
[00:27:30]  Now you're making money.  You're the fucking, he's like the star of fucking voiceovers.  Now they're putting him on the Today Show and talk shows.  And she's like, hey, where's mine?  Where's mine's, motherfucker?  Where's mine's?  Well, here's his side of the story of the altercation that happened in L.A.  Well, my side of it.  Right.  I wanted to bring it to a close by just saying, you know, shut the hell up and let me talk to your mother.  When that was said out of my mouth, my daughter exploded, just erupted into this jump up in my face type thing. 
[00:28:00]  Did he say shut the fuck up?  This got the flying, none of which were mine.  None of which were mine.  But they were escalating to that point where it could have gotten really ugly.  And so in the process of doing that, I got scratched on my face and my nose, the bridge of my nose or the nostril part of my nose was, you know, just scarred.  What's the music?  It's the stupid entertainment program.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. 
[00:28:30]  What the fuck is that?  Because they know they don't have anything of substance to say, so they got to pump it up with music and stingers and shit.  Terrible.  You don't watch the entertainment shows?  No!  It's so fucking annoying.  How about you just have the guy tell his side of the story?  Whatever it is, that's what it is.  That's captivating enough.  You don't need to pump it up with music and horse shit.  Everyone, you know, this guy's been in the news for a week.  You kind of want to hear what he's saying about his daughter.  You don't need, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it. 
[00:29:00]  And I was scratched on the bridge of the nose and I'm dancing right now.  Now I'm, hey, hey, ho, ho, Haiti, hey, ho, ho.  My daughter is a cunt.  She's a cunt, a cunt.  Hug my knee grubbing little cunt.  I'm doing the what's up with my hands.  What's up?  What's up?  I'm dancing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't need the music.  What?  Yeah.  What is he saying?  And I'm sure they teased this the entire show. 
[00:29:30]  Of course.  They got maybe one to two minutes of material for a half hour show.  Oh, yeah.  And the rest of the show is just teasing it.  Coming up, we're going to play the exclusive audio.  You think we teach shit.  From Ted Williams.  Fuck.  Here's more of the story.  His daughter, Jean, I don't know, is it Jean?  Spelled J'Nay?  It's got to be J'Nay-Nay or something.  J'Nay.  It's not Jean.  Can't be Jean.  I'm not hiring anyone named J'Nay.  Jean?  I would hire a Jean or a Jen. 
[00:30:00]  What's a J'Nay-Nay?  What is a J'Nay-Nay?  Well, where's Jean?  Huh?  Yeah.  His daughter, J'Nay-Nay-Nay, tells her side of the story.  Daughter J'Nay tells her side.  And he was like,  And I stand up out of my chair and I said,  Who the f*** are you talking to?  She's sure telling her side of the story.  And he said,  And I said,  And I was like,  And hey, what are you doing?  He's like,  I'm making money.  And I'm like, 
[00:30:30]  I know you's making money.  And she's like,  He's like,  I got the golden voice.  And I'm like,  I knows I need some money.  Where's mine?  And he's like,  F***ing shut up.  Who the f*** are you talking to?  She was screaming,  I'm going to sell this story.  You know,  you don't have to worry about it.  But,  you know,  I'm going to sell this story.  He said,  You,  you fat s***.  And when he said that,  he just got angry.  You think you've got bad press now,  you know,  and you're screaming all of these things.  And I'm thinking,  Oh,  Lord,  I truly expected the cops to show up a lot sooner. 
[00:31:00]  Jesus.  Scandal within a week,  this motherfucker.  He can't hold it together for a week.  Well,  you know,  that fat bitch daughter was probably saying that I'm going to expose you.  And a guy's family is a guy's family.  But she's a piece of s***.  But you know why she's a piece of s***?  Because he's a piece of s***.  But maybe she's not a piece of s***.  Let me take the other side.  That's what I'm saying.  Maybe she's had it with her fucking mother.  Exactly.  That has never been around.  Like if she's being a piece of s***.  And now she's seeing everybody praise this fucking guy. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  And she knows the real story of this guy.  Exactly.  Just like his mommy did.  Hi,  mommy.  Hi,  mommy.  Hi,  mommy.  Oh,  motherfucker.  Don't disappoint me,  motherfucker.  This says it all.  It really does.  Listen to the end of this clip.  This is why I think Janaynay  might have,  I have the right story here.  Please don't disappoint me.  I'm not,  mom.  I'm not.  You hear that?  Please don't disappoint me.  Don't disappoint.  We all know you've disappointed everybody around you all these years.  It's the first thing in her head. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  Oh,  jeez,  nigga,  please don't disappoint me,  motherfucker.  I can't stay there.  Right.  Yeah.  That's exactly what the fuck is going on.  I think Janaynay is sticking up for her mom.  Janaynay.  For her mom.  Yeah.  Janaynay also claims Ted has relapsed under the pressure of his new life.  I certainly have not.  Oh no,  Ted.  Did you relapse Ted?  No,  I did not.  I had rum raisin ice cream.  Rum raisin ice cream.  Yes,  I did.  My uncle Paul had some and he gave me some recently.  Is that bad for an alcoholic to have rum raisin ice cream? 
[00:32:30]  I thought it was only rum flavored,  but the next thing you know,  I was driving quickly and there was parents screaming after me.  They had to throw their stroller at my car apparently.  Why would anyone do that?  I don't know.  I hope that's what happened.  Your judgment was impaired and you hid it.  I don't know what happened,  but I know a baby bottle bounced off my windshield.  Rum raisin ice cream is a little strong.  Oh,  it really got me toasty warm,  Anthony.  What child motherfuckers got to do?  I'll give a fuck. 
[00:33:00]  I was fucking doing it.  Ted's fucking hammered.  Where's Bob?  I was fucked up.  Be that gold voice motherfucker.  Oh my papa!  Ted gets a little fucking rambunctious when he's hammered.  He sure does.  All right,  let's,  Janae Nae is saying he's,  Janae Nae.  Saying he relapsed.  Janae also claims Ted has relapsed under the pressure of his new life.  He has consumed at least a bottle of Grey Goose at night. 
[00:33:30]  At least.  Wow.  That's not including the Coronas he orders.  To keep the cup?  That's not including the Budweiser's he orders.  That's not including the other alcohol,  the wines.  He drinks heavily.  Daddy's not sober.  I can prove it.  How?  I have no idea because that's not true.  And,  you know,  just selling me out on,  on,  on this fame and fortune ticket.  Oh boy.  Wow.  What do you think,  Jimmy?  It didn't take long.  You know this world a little bit.  Is she lying?  Is he lying? 
[00:34:00]  What the fuck's going on?  Very hard to say.  But the fact that she said a bottle of Grey Goose at night and those things he bought makes  people leave her.  Yeah.  But again,  she could just be going by what his history is.  No,  I would say,  I would say this guy fell off the wagon and he gets,  he's probably a very nasty drunk.  And,  uh,  it's over.  I predicted,  I predicted this.  My guess.  You can't give a guy like that,  that much money unsupervised and let him just fucking run wild. 
[00:34:30]  I hope I'm wrong.  But I think in the video that he probably lied.  Like,  you know,  saying he was sober two years,  just because you're talking to a guy who's giving you money.  He's not talking to the whole country at that moment.  He's talking to a guy.  You go,  yeah,  I'm sober for a couple of years.  You know,  you just try to get a few bucks out of the guy to fucking get a drink.  Right.  Well,  you're lying.  Pants full of shit.  That's what I say to that homeless.  Bum.  Now I want to know more.  I mean,  he went out to LA and he's been in contact obviously with his kids, 
[00:35:00]  I guess.  Yeah.  Since this all went down.  Cause she's saying every night.  So it sounds like she's been around a few days already.  Maybe she just knows his history.  He's fucking shacked up at the Renaissance in Hollywood.  Is that a nice hotel?  Yeah.  It has to be right.  And,  and he's,  he's,  he's probably like,  hi room service.  Yeah.  He has no,  send up a bottle of wine,  a little gray goose and some macaroni and cheese from Kraft.  He officially doesn't have a home.  No.  He's not going to go back to Cleveland with that Cavs offer for a mortgage in a,  in a shitty house. 
[00:35:30]  Oh my God.  His sites are on New York or LA at this point.  He fucking had his head shoved in that mini bar.  You know,  that mini bar was stripped like a Buick.  That hotel room.  That fucking thing.  That hotel room door closes then.  And it's just sitting there.  It's sitting there.  How are they going to get,  they can't leave him like that.  And then he's got,  and then he's probably got his vultures going,  look,  man,  we're paying for the hotel.  So whatever you want.  No worries.  Great.  Right. 
[00:36:00]  Hey,  look at these little bottles.  How much for a big bottle?  I have some of that and some Kraft macaroni and cheese to wash it down with,  to wash this down with.  I have a burger from Big Kahuna Burger.  We should play Frankie Blue today.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin,  what's up,  brother?  Yeah,  that's what I see.  Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue action.  One of our favorite stories of all time.  What's Obi doing on that golf thing?  Is that me peeing on a golf course?  What's that?  That looks like you. 
[00:36:30]  Who is that?  Owen Wilson.  I see.  Yeah,  that's the old gag.  I wasn't even going for that.  If Owen Wilson didn't have such a fucked up nose,  then I would say,  yeah,  all right,  I look a little bit like him.  Chicks dig him.  It's okay.  But he's got the most fucked up nose ever.  It's all right.  It's got a fucking nose job,  you idiot.  It might ruin his singing voice.  Look at that fucking thing.  He does have a dick nose.  His nose looks like a dick.  Like a pencil neck dick.  Yeah,  the end of it is the head of the penis.  Not a Brett Favre type of penis. 
[00:37:00]  No,  no,  no,  the opposite.  That is a horrible nose.  It's got like a,  you know those baboons that have those big,  ah,  cha,  cha,  cha,  cha.  That's the nose he has,  because it's been busted or some shit.  That shit's busted.  Hey,  Kevin,  do you really have 18 inches of snow?  Yes,  we did.  I shoveled twice already.  Connecticut,  yeah,  yeah.  We're fucking hammered.  You're getting hammered,  huh?  Well,  it's Connecticut.  Who cares,  really?  I'm drinking beers.  What a non-state that is.  You're getting hammered?  Are you going to work today? 
[00:37:30]  No,  I work nights.  This is my nighttime.  I'm just drinking beers.  What do you do?  Pimp?  I,  that's you.  I'm an inspector.  Oh,  that's nice.  I checked Blackhawk helicopter parts,  remember?  Yeah,  I remember.  Oh,  chicken inspector.  I remember he did some kind of like shady shit.  Blackhawk helicopter parts.  Shady shit.  That's nice.  Yeah,  we talked about the Jesus pin.  Yeah.  No,  we don't have one of those.  I know,  it's a Blackhawk,  the old school U.S. did.  I know my helicopters.  You're a little more advanced than that.  Where do you work?  Sikorsky? 
[00:38:00]  For a vendor,  yes.  Yes.  See,  it knows.  Love fucking.  I make Blackhawk.  Blackhawk helicopters,  get it?  Right.  All right,  Kevin.  Thank you.  Love you guys.  Bye.  Later,  man.  Can we play Frankie Blue with it making sense?  I would love to.  Maybe go on a break with it?  I haven't heard that in a while.  I guess the setup is really easy.  One of the fucking legendary program guys here in New York,  I don't know,  went to a Christmas party and had a little too much of something. 
[00:38:30]  Oh.  We've heard rumors over the years that it was more than alcohol.  I've heard.  I've heard booze.  We weren't there,  so we don't know.  We've heard pills.  We've heard weed.  We've heard,  we heard everything.  I heard his hat was soaked in like the stuff that makes a cucumber into a pickle.  Yeah.  That'll get you.  Sure will.  And the Christmas party,  radio Christmas parties used to be great.  Yeah,  they're gone now.  They did away with them after the Frankie Blue incident,  I think.  Thing of the past.  I think we all get to blame Frankie Blue.  And the fucking economy just fucked it up in corporate assholes that don't want to spend money. 
[00:39:00]  After the Christmas party,  he goes back to the radio station and some broads on,  gets in a little fight with her.  She's like,  go fuck yourself and leaves.  So now the station needs a DJ,  and Frankie Blue goes,  I can do this with my eyes closed.  He's a superhero.  He stepped right in.  Right.  So you're about to hear Frankie Blue completely blow up his career here.  Yeah.  This,  this tape made the rounds because somebody that used to work for us was a board op over there  and was smart enough to hit record. 
[00:39:30]  And we got,  we were the ones that broke this.  Yeah.  We were the only ones that got a copy of this.  He is in no condition to be on the air.  No,  none.  Really bad.  None.  So we'll go to break with this Frankie Blue.  Once again,  we love this fucking audio.  I love this.  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Now,  you know,  for the last several weeks,

This is the OB and Anthony show.  The OB and Anthony show.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor. 
[00:43:30]  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Let the body sit the floor.  Drowning pool, huh? 
[00:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  While you're playing this, knowing it is going to incite people to commit violence against others.  I love how the fuddy-duddies, we'll call them fuddy-duddies.  Fuddy-duddies.  They see that the Arizona shooter had this song on one of his YouTube videos.  And now they're very worried.  And the song's been out almost ten years.  I hear they're going to sue the singer.  Yeah.  There's a brilliant article by this guy.  I forget his name. 
[00:44:30]  It's Jonah Goldberg in the Post today.  About Jonah Goldberg!  And he's talking about censorship is an absurd idea.  And all the things that I guess we should begin censoring now.  One of them is Catcher in the Rye.  Yeah.  Chapman had that, I believe, in his hand, didn't he, when he shot that?  Or he had read it or whatever.  He was obsessed with it.  That's a prerequisite.  It's absolute must-read for the serial killer, crazy person, abductor. 
[00:45:00]  Why is no one talking about banning that book?  Yeah.  But, oh, no, there's political rhetoric.  There's a target over a congressional district, which everybody knows what that means.  We all know.  Catcher in the Rye has become like a joke when it comes to serial killers, assassins, kidnappers.  It's become a joke because it's so, it's common knowledge that a lot of people that have committed these crimes have read that book. 
[00:45:30]  It's just become the thing to do.  Yeah.  Have you ever read that book?  So what?  It's a great book.  I heard about it.  It's like some guy, he's at a cliff, right, and there's a big rye field, and kids are running toward the cliff, right?  And he's the guy that, it's his job to, like, keep them from running off the edge of the cliff, and it's the pressure of, is that the other book? 
[00:46:00]  I don't know.  I've never, I don't want to see it.  Catcher in the Rye.  That's like his job is to catch the kids before they run off the cliff because they can't see where they're going because the rye is so high as an elephant's eye.  And they run and they fall off the cliffs.  And his job is to catch the kids.  And there's so many kids, and it's such pressure.  It's crazy.  So you've got to shoot people.  I think I didn't read Catcher in the Rye then.  Really?  What's the other book I'm thinking of?  Rumble Fish?  Yeah, Rumble Fish. 
[00:46:30]  The Little Train That Could.  Who wrote?  The Clock.  The Big Clock.  Who wrote Catcher in the Rye?  J.D. Salinger.  Yeah, Salinger.  Salinger, right.  I thought it was about a kid in New York losing his fucking mind.  Really?  Could be.  I don't know now.  I think that whole right field thing is in his head.  It's in his head, yeah.  That part of it.  It's a dreamy thing.  That part of it isn't.  Okay, yes.  Yeah, it's like a fantasy dreamy thing that it does.  But it actually takes place in New York City.  Okay.  And it really, like, it gets.  I thought I was losing my mind.  It gets like, but you can understand, like, the pressure you'd have, like, dreaming about 
[00:47:00]  that, that your responsibility is to catch all these people running toward a cliff in  a rye field.  I just want Sarah Palin to come out of the...  It's a rye field anyway.  I want Sarah Palin to come out of hiding, you know?  She's never been shy before.  Let's go, Sarah.  What do you got to say?  She knows.  I believe that, you know, the rhetoric didn't, you know, cause this guy to obviously do what  he did.  She knows whatever she says. 
[00:47:30]  I love how she's now hiding.  She's usually very brave.  But whatever she says is going to be twisted around.  Yeah.  So do something, man.  She's doing something.  Sitting there and keeping her fucking yap shut.  That's not going to work out for her.  It's probably the smartest move she can make right now.  It really does have nothing to do with her.  Even the NRA.  The NRA.  She should fucking fight her way through this.  They asked for a statement from the NRA, and the NRA said, this isn't the time to make  a statement, our prayers go out to the family.  Like, they even know that no matter what they say, it's going to be twisted around. 
[00:48:00]  There are certain people, organizations, whatever, that cannot say anything right now because  it will be used against them.  But she's never been shy of controversy.  But she knows that right now is not the time to make a statement because it seems, first  of all, self-serving, like you're defending yourself against this, and it can be twisted  around.  She certainly could just explain her map.  No, no, no, no.  There's no explanation necessary.  None.  I don't, believe me, again, I got to reiterate because people twist this around. 
[00:48:30]  I don't like Sarah Palin.  She's kryptonite for the Republican Party.  Don't want her on the ticket.  Don't want her near the ticket in two years.  I agree.  It's a losing proposition.  But it would be dumb as fuck for her to come out and say anything right now.  She's done nothing wrong.  The sheriff looks like a dummy that's coming out and talking about how symbols and words  have to be restricted and regulated because this is a direct cause of people talking. 
[00:49:00]  And he looks like a dumb fuck.  Why would you say anything right now when the only thing that's going to happen are people  are going to twist it around and use it against?  Well, how about pointing out the truth?  This guy is subject to the exact same rhetoric and symbols that the rest of us are.  He's a sociopath and a pig and he shot a nine-year-old and a woman because that's what he wanted  to do.  He stalked this woman for three years and anybody out there that thinks it's because  of rhetoric, you're dumb. 
[00:49:30]  There's no misinterpreting.  You're stupid.  We all read the same stuff.  And this great article in the Post, it's like, should catch from the Ryby Band or how  about Mein Kampf or all these other things.  All these other things that are sold that are inflammatory.  It's amazing how fast liberals who are supposed to be these free speech, this oasis of free  thought, you are, no one wants to ban words and phrases and thought more than you. 
[00:50:00]  What happened to you?  How come when Reagan got shot, they didn't try to ban taxi driver and try to end, what's  the name's, uh, career?  Jodie Foster or Robert De Niro.  Jodie Foster's career or Robert De Niro's career.  Yeah, why not?  That movie should have been banned.  It, it direct, and that did.  And he said that's why he did it.  Directly influenced why he shot the president was that movie, Taxi Driver. 
[00:50:30]  He said it.  And Jodie Foster, he said it.  It wasn't speculated.  So why wasn't that movie removed from our society?  I wonder if this guy saw Taxi Driver.  Great movie.  He shaved his head just like fucking Travis Bickle.  There's, uh, there's some similarities there as well.  You can't trust a guy like Travis.  They're just shooting people, kicking people in the balls.  I don't know what they do.  Travis, the name Travis is just trouble.  Did you guys see, uh, Chris Matthews, uh, take on this whole thing?  No!  Why would I listen to that jizz bag?  Yeah, he did.  That MSNBC predictable pussy. 
[00:51:00]  Him and Bill Maher should dock.  I like Bill.  And then have their, their penises cut in half with a machete.  I want to play it.  We should find it now.  Really?  Oh yeah, he went off.  Of course he did!  Of course he did!  But that's another brilliant example, Ant.  What about, what about Taxi Driver?  Yeah.  That was the movie that let, Hankley said, inspired him.  He didn't, it wasn't speculated.  He said it!  Chris Matthews sucks.  This guy never said a word.  This guy has not said a word about his intentions, why he did this, what influence, anything. 
[00:51:30]  Nothing.  And everyone else is speculating, and, and then trying to legislate on speculation.  When, when, when Reagan got shot, it was completely because of Jodie Foster and Taxi Driver, yet  that movie is still played.  Well, they used it to target guns.  That, and again, that was Brady pushing that as well, the Brady because he got shot.  I fucking hated Mike Brady for that whole thing, and I'm glad he got the AIDS because 
[00:52:00]  of it.  Well, I want to play the Chris Matthews thing, because it'll infuriate you guys.  I want to, I want to play that.  Well, it's not even that I infuriate, it's predictable.  It is what the left has become.  I hate to say it, I'm sick of bashing liberals.  I agree with most of you on a lot of stuff.  But the other side's not predictable, Jimmy.  Yeah, but we know they're predictable.  Like, both sides are predictable, though.  But the left is supposed to be, conservatives were never free speech guys.  We all knew if you violated religion or the Catholic Church, or you said the dirty words 
[00:52:30]  like Janet Jackson, you show your tits, and they're going to bitch and moan and shut you  down.  They are what they are.  And I know what they are, so I know what I'm in for with them.  They didn't come and say, we are this new thought process.  We are artists.  We are, they never claimed to be that.  So, with them, they're consistent in sometimes their awfulness.  The liberals are supposed to be different.  Supposed to be open-minded, progressive.  Yeah, colleges, progressive, free thinkers.  Where's all your free thinking?  There's no free thinking there. 
[00:53:00]  None of it.  Carlin even said it.  Chris Matthews would tell you, though, he operates on the 40-yard line.  Yeah.  He likes to say that a lot.  He doesn't.  I hope he gets sacked.  And his leg snaps like thighs.  And he says guys like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly, they operate on the 5-yard line.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, wait a minute.  Was my speech a little too crazy?  Is somebody going to, since I said he was on the 40-yard line and maybe he should have  got a leg like thighs.  Is that inflammatory?  Is that something, maybe now somebody will break his leg and I'll be held liable for that? 
[00:53:30]  Danny, can you find the Chris Matthews?  It should be online by now.  Chris Matthews is a dummy.  Or get it down the hall.  Do you want to say a left-wing maniac shot somebody?  And him being left-wing has nothing to do with it.  I don't blame liberals for that.  He's a psychopath.  He's crazy.  There's no one to blame.  He shoots somebody and they blame the fucking people.  There's no one else to blame.  What babies.  There's no one to blame.  There's no speech, no movie, no music.  No one is to blame but this lunatic.  Yeah.  And his own crazy-ass mind. 
[00:54:00]  It is never anybody's fault but yours if you shoot somebody.  That's it.  But the people, oh, the people with an agenda love, both sides, both sides, with an agenda,  love coming up with reasons why they did it, and then knee-jerk legislation.  The conservatives are vomit-inducing, too, because now they're attacking airport security.  It's invasive.  Like, all of a sudden, they're now the, these are my, don't violate my civil liberties guys,  just to feel vomit administration. 
[00:54:30]  They're phony, too.  But the left was supposed to be different.  You guys claim to be different.  And I'm, I'm in a business where there's a lot of liberals, and I make my living with  speaking.  Yeah.  So I see what I get in trouble for.  And I see who comes after me for what, or who comments on what, or what offends people.  And it makes me sick.  Yeah, yeah.  I, so what's standards and practices used to tell me you couldn't say on TV.  It was always left-wing ideology.  Yeah.  I hate to say it.  I'm for gay marriage.  I'm for gay adoption.  I agree with you fuckers on most things.  We're working on it ourselves. 
[00:55:00]  God damn it.  As a matter of fact, me and Jimmy are trying to get a young black child brought over from  Zimbabwe.  Do you know how frustrating that is, though?  To have to fucking have them think I'm a conservative just because I don't want my speech censored,  or I don't think that I'm a victim of civil liberties violation because I don't mind being  searched before I go onto a plane where a Muslim may fucking, you can't be categorized  as a middle-of-the-road guy anymore, because no matter what you say, they will take one fucking  sentence and label you.  So, we like playing both sides here. 
[00:55:30]  We really do.  But we are categorized as either right-wing or left-wing, depending on what fucking minute  it is and what we're blasting out of our shithole mouths.  We've got to play the Chris Matthews.  Do you have it?  I want to hear it.  It'll be fun.  Oh, do we have it?  It's online somewhere, or we can get it down.  Yeah, I want to hear it.  I'm for it, because I heard what kind of what he said.  I actually want to hear Bill Maher on Leno, too.  We can do that.  I want to hear that.  Because that motherfucker is another delusional cocksucker. 
[00:56:00]  I fucking hate Bill Maher and his delusional thinking.  He's got quite the fan base, Ant.  What a fuck dick.  Fuck him and his fag base.  I don't care.  You've got to move into political talk.  It's time.  Oh, believe me.  It's time.  I'd love to do it from my basement, but, you know.  It's just time to do that.  She made a logo.  It spins around.  It says Sirius XM on it.  Oh, that's wonderful.  I hope it's acceptable.  Hey, uh... 
[00:56:30]  All right.  We'll get that audio.  Yeah, we've got to get that shit.  Oh, God.  Speaking of drowning pool, let the bodies hit the floor.  Truthy on Twitter saying that we've got to sue the singing parrot.  Do you remember the singing parrot?  Yes.  Did that song.  I love that guy.  You got that.  We haven't played that in a while.  This is why the Arizona shooter did it. 
[00:57:00]  It's a parrot.  It's a parrot.  I love this thing.  That's the coolest parrot.  That is the coolest parrot ever. 
[00:57:30]  That's 3.5 million views on the original.  That's one of those videos where everyone just rips it off and has their own version of it,  but the original's up to 3.5.  Dumb parrot.  Somebody quoted Ron Bennington on Twitter, and I wish I would have heard Ronnie say this.  They said Ronnie actually brought up, I guess, the J.D. Salinger thing.  But he said he also asked, should dogs be banned because Son of Sam thought they talked to him?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's another one.  There you go.  I had a little chat with Ronnie B. and Fez Watley. 
[00:58:00]  We're just too not queer, and by that I mean Ronnie.  I had a little chat on my way home.  Since we had a meeting yesterday, I had the pleasure of listening to the Ron and Fez show on my way home,  and I gave him a call because Fez Watley was coming out with some of the most bizarre shit I've ever heard a human being say.  What was he saying?  Well, he's very afraid of guns, which, whatever.  But I noticed a lot of people that have opinions on guns, gun laws, what guns are used for, what they're not used for, 
[00:58:30]  that pistols are nothing but things to shoot people with and have never touched a gun.  A lot of people that have great opinions about their guns never touched one, never saw one, never fucking don't even know what it's like to shoot one.  But they're experts.  And Fezzy started talking about how this guy that did the shooting in Arizona went to a Walmart, tried to get ammo. 
[00:59:00]  For some reason, the first Walmart he went to, they wouldn't sell him ammo.  There's no reason, given why they didn't.  Whether they were out of 9mm ammo.  Is that true, by the way?  Yeah.  Okay.  Whether he didn't have the proper ID, I don't know what it is.  No one's saying what it is.  Walmart isn't commenting.  But he went to another Walmart, and Walmart sold him the ammo.  This was hours before the shooting.  He got his 9mm ammo, loaded up, and went on his rampage. 
[00:59:30]  Fez suggested that this gentleman that sold the assassin, or would-be assassin, the ammunition, should be held liable and arrested for selling this man the ammunition.  He sold it to him legally, didn't he?  Well, now Fezzy's logic.  He said it is exactly like the bartender rule, where if a bartender serves somebody that's drunk, and they go out and kill somebody as they're driving, the bartender can be held liable, because they're serving a drunk, and it's his responsibility. 
[01:00:00]  That seems to be an easy one to get out of, by the way, because what do you know?  You don't know what the fucking guy did after he left your establishment.  Exactly.  Did he have a little bottle in the car?  But technically, there is a law against that.  But I think that's a tough one.  It is.  It's very tough.  I wonder how many people are actually prosecuted for that.  But he was making that comparison, saying it's exactly the same.  I called up because I had to say that the bartender, it's his job to look at somebody at the bar, realize if they're drunk or not, or too drunk, and then cut them off and not serve them to protect the license of the bar and your job and a lawsuit and whatever, what might happen when the guy leaves. 
[01:00:30]  If someone's selling ammunition to a gentleman that has the proper identification, it's just his job to sell the shit.  It's not his job to assess what the man is going to do with the ammo and then be held responsible for what the guy does with the ammunition. 
[01:01:00]  And I brought up the analogy again.  A lot of people are making the analogy between cars and guns.  But again, I did the same thing.  It's like holding a car dealer responsible for selling a man a car that is then used to run through a crowd of people.  Fez also said, in order to buy ammunition, you should have to take a test and go through a background check like you do when you buy a gun just to buy the bullets for the gun every time you want to buy ammo. 
[01:01:30]  And then I suggested, well, then you should have to take another road test and test, written test, every time you want to buy gasoline for your car, which would be very inconvenient.  But why shouldn't you then every time be assessed if you can drive without hurting anybody whenever you fuel your car up?  More importantly, when did he start crying?  It was probably 3.2 seconds into the conversation.  No, he actually held up pretty well.  He held his arm. 
[01:02:00]  Ronnie did a great job talking about how Fez and other people, like-minded people, just want the government to make them safe.  They want other people with guns to keep them safe, other people with regulations, other people with uniforms, the government themselves smoking food, fattened food, this, that.  No one wants to take responsibility.  No one wants to hold anyone else responsible.  They want the government to jump in and regulate everything. 
[01:02:30]  I read a tweet last night that just dumbfounded me to the point I couldn't even fucking respond to it.  But he was bringing up my point about Chicago, where you couldn't even legally own a gun, a handgun in Chicago.  It's against the law.  They changed the law now, I know.  Don't get on me on that.  But believe me, the crime when you couldn't own a gun in Chicago, just as bad, if not worse, than it is now.  Right.  So I was talking about that, and this guy goes, Anthony, that's ignorant, it's stupid, you're talking about one place in the country that you can't own guns in, that the crime is running rampant. 
[01:03:00]  If the whole country didn't have guns, we'd have a peaceful country.  He goes, look at China.  He goes, look at China.  And the crime rate in China with shooting.  And all I'm thinking is, this motherfucker, do you want the same freedoms or lack thereof that we have in China, that they have in China here? 
[01:03:30]  Because that's what you're talking about.  You can't compare China and the lack of freedoms they give their people there to America and the constitutional rights you have in America and then say, well, they don't have much gun violence there.  It's like, yeah, but go on fucking Google and you'll get your hands chopped off, dumb fuck.  Basically, you would rather dodge bullets to go do some cool shit in America.  Exactly.  Exactly. 
[01:04:00]  There's a lot of cool shit to do in America.  But you're going to have to dodge some bullets to get to some of these things.  It sounds silly when you say it like that.  I'd try to keep it silly.  But it is true.  Right.  But it is true.  With freedom comes certain dangers because you're giving individuals the freedoms to do certain things.  Can I go back to the car thing for a second?  Yeah.  I think guns are regulated way more than fucking cars.  Yeah, they are.  And I believe, I'm just talking cars now. 
[01:04:30]  There's a lot of fucking people that don't know what the fuck they're doing behind the wheel.  And maybe there should be, maybe it should be tougher to get a license.  It should be more stringent.  Or maybe, maybe you don't get a license at 17 and that's it for your entire life.  Maybe it would be a hassle, obviously.  And as soon as they make this law, I'd be the first one to be yelling and screaming and be frustrated.  But maybe, maybe every once in a while you got to be retested.  Every two years I have to be re-evaluated for my pistol license.  Right.  Every two years.  And you get a license at 17, you never have to be retested.  You never again have to be retested. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  And you could have things that happen during your life that make you an incapable driver.  And I'll tell you this much, I try not to get involved with the gun thing too much,  but I'm more, I'll be honest, I'm more scared of driving around than people with guns.  Well, you'll certainly have more of a chance of being killed or injured in a car than a gun.  I'm way more scared when I'm on the New Jersey Turnpike going to Philly or some of these fucking roads  where they're coming right at you at 70 miles an hour.  There's not even a barrier between you. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, it'll be paint.  There's two lines of paint.  Yeah, people see the paint and that's good enough.  There's paint.  I'm way more scared of that shit than a gun.  And driving is a privilege, gun ownership is a right, yet it's so much easier to exercise  a privilege than to exercise a constitutional right, and people would rather have a right  taken away than a privilege, which astounds me.  They're dumb.  Well, here's, I play this, I play this because it's kind of fun when everyone gets riled up. 
[01:06:00]  This is Chris Matthews starting a show yesterday.  Chris Matthews, this is just going to fuck, okay, I got to buckle in.  And just so you know, I'm not an MSNBC guy.  I actually hate Keith Olbermann with all my heart.  I'm not a fan of fucking Bill O'Reilly.  I probably have the same hate for Bill O'Reilly.  But I do, where I'm at, I love just checking it all out and see how ridiculous this stuff is.  Yeah.  I don't focus on one side.  I just don't have enough time in my day to fucking worry that much about it. 
[01:06:30]  But I did take a peek at Chris Matthews when he started his show yesterday, and buckle in.  Good evening, I'm Chris Matthews in Washington.  I want to focus tonight on the crosshairs.  If you don't want to hear what I'm saying right now, just go to your desktop or BlackBerry  and look up the word crosshairs.  It'll make the same point.  Just go to Google and write crosshairs under the news.  It'll take you to one person, one American political figure in this country.  It's the person who's made crosshairs her political signature.  Want to know who this person doesn't like? 
[01:07:00]  Just check the crosshairs.  It's how this particular American politician IDs the preferred target.  Right there in the crosshairs.  Don't retreat comes to command from the same politician that same day.  Reload.  Reload, of course.  Don't forget to check those crosshairs when you do about who the enemy is.  Well, last spring before she was shot, Congresswoman Gabrielle Gifford said that she was in  a certain politician's targeted list, and she'd been put in the crosshairs of a gun  site on that politician's website.  Congresswoman Giffords drew her own conclusions. 
[01:07:30]  Quote, when people do that, they've got to realize there's consequences to that action.  Well, now after the shooting and the deaths, the politician who put Congresswoman Giffords  and others in her crosshairs has put out word that those crosshairs are really something  else, something to do with surveying, that they're not the bullseye this very politician  herself said at the time they were intended to be.  Well, that's not the way this crime is going to get written up in the history accounts.  It will include an account of how Congresswoman Giffords had been targeted, placed in the  crosshairs of a gun site prior to the attack by one person, former Governor Sarah Palin. 
[01:08:00]  Now, with all the history in this country in support of the Second Amendment, there's also  an up-to-date history of rejecting politicians who used the threat of gunplay against other  politicians.  Sarah Angle, for example, out in Nevada, talked of Second Amendment remedies against Congress  and the need to, quote, take out Senator Harry Reid.  The opponent of Debbie Wasserman Schultz invited voters to shoot at a human-shaped target that  had her initials next to it.  Well, voters don't like politicians who do this kind of thing.  To bring up Obama?  They're both out of the picture now. 
[01:08:30]  Well, as Republican consultant Todd Harris put it in the newspaper today, Governor Palin  is now missing an opportunity to show that she's a leader at a higher level.  Let's see whether she joins the country in saying that however we may disagree in this  country, people shouldn't be talking about guns, reloading them or targeting them as a  way to solve political arguments.  It's in the governor's hands.  Why didn't he bring up the point that Obama said, you know, if you bring a knife, we bring 
[01:09:00]  a gun?  Because he's a liberal phony.  Why didn't he bring up the point that three years prior, there was a Democratic ad that  showed targets on various states, much in the same way that Sarah Palin did?  Why doesn't he bring that shit up?  Because he's got an agenda, a liberal cunt-wad agenda.  It is sickening, man.  I hate this motherfucker.  God, do I hate him.  But he is, the thing that's refreshing about Matthews is, it's like, you know, sometimes  you feel paranoid, like, why do I think this way? 
[01:09:30]  Like, am I that nuts?  Yeah.  And then the guy comes out and is that stupid.  And he's a, again, he's not like a news anchor.  But he's being dishonest.  He's editorializing.  He's holding back information that makes his point, that bolsters his point.  It's fucking spin.  Just like everything else.  It's liberal spin, just like Fox News has Republican and conservative spin.  No, no spin zone.  Oh, except no spin zone. 
[01:10:00]  No spin zone.  Of course.  You'll never spin there.  Bill O'Reilly keeps it very honest.  You'll never spin there.  Like a fucking Cuisinart they spin.  Bill O'Reilly does, certainly.  We will do.  You'll fucking puke.  You're so dizzy.  You'll puke.  I get dizzy.  You think you got dizzy watching Cloverfield?  I fucking...  Fucking sit down in an interview with Bill O'Reilly and watch how...  You're in a spinny chair as he's interviewing you.  I watch Bill O'Reilly.  I get off my couch and take a piss.  I go, whoa!  But he'll claim it's the no spin zone.  I fall down. 
[01:10:30]  Which is the funniest thing I've ever seen on TV.  It's spinning.  Everything.  It's spinning.  That fucking guy spins.  He spins.  It's spinning.  He's a spinner.  Bill O'Reilly's spinning.  It's fucking...  And you know what?  Fuck the crosshairs.  She put targets.  They're crosshairs.  A target does not necessarily mean...  And this going...  Believe me.  This guy...  There's no proof that this guy saw these targets and fucking anything.  Of course not. 
[01:11:00]  A target is a metaphor.  Of course it is.  In many ways.  I got that.  But you agree that they're actual targets, right?  They're crosshairs that you see in a scope of a rifle scope.  One of her people came out yesterday and said, no, it's actually a survey symbol.  So they're not even taking responsibility for the fact that this was rhetoric and she had gun targets.  Be honest.  She didn't mean that you should go out and shoot somebody.  But now she's trying to spin and say, no, they're actually survey symbols. 
[01:11:30]  I don't even know what the...  Be honest.  I don't know what the symbol would be that makes it look like it's crosshairs, but it's  actually something else.  I've looked through a survey scope and the story poll so you could fucking...  That's what her people are claiming yesterday.  No, that's crazy.  See, at least own up to what you did.  It's a target, but it's a metaphor.  You're targeting certain areas and districts and politicians for re-election and to overthrow 
[01:12:00]  them in their office or get them out of office and beat them in an election.  You're targeting that district.  It doesn't mean you're bombing them with a Norton bombsite, Jimmy, or targeting them with  a rifle scope and a bullet.  A target has been used metaphorically throughout history.  You target something.  Let's go to Mike in Memphis.  It's ridiculous to take literally every fucking time. 
[01:12:30]  He's saying you're missing the point on the crosshair.  Am I?  Am I?  Am I?  Let's go, Mikey.  Hi, Mike.  You know, I just wanted to say that, you know, people are missing the whole point of  the crosshairs.  You know, there should have been 200 million other people.  We've all seen the same thing on TV.  How come there wasn't a bunch of people lined up doing the same thing?  Exactly.  Yeah, we're all Manchurian candidates waiting to see a target, and then we just fucking  walk away with guns and start shooting people?  No.  No.  The difference is they know it, dude. 
[01:13:00]  This is what bothers me.  Everyone looking at those targets.  It was a target.  It is a metaphor for, let's go and get...  Nobody thinks that Sarah Palin meant for people to shoot, and anybody saying she did  is a fucking liar.  You're lying.  They're not even crazy.  Not crazy.  You're lying.  They're liars.  Dishonored.  And you're fucking vultures.  You're political vultures, and you're taking this murder as an opportunity to just attack  the other side.  Chris Matthews, you phony cocksucker. 
[01:13:30]  He is.  You phony cocksucker.  You know Sarah Palin did not mean that as a target.  You know that.  Everyone does.  And I know you know that.  Regardless if you don't like the woman, you don't like her fucking politics, if you hate  her, you cannot honestly think that when she put crosshairs on a map to target certain  areas, that it's metaphor and not literal, let's eliminate these people. 
[01:14:00]  And it's why the whole country hated Bush, and then two years later, hates you guys again.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you understand how fucking out of touch with the way most people think you are?  I love the miss me yet picture.  Jesus Christ.  Bush with the miss me yet on the bottom.  I love that one.  I wanted Obama to win.  I really did.  I said I wanted Obama to win.  How did you lose everybody already?  Two years.  Two years.  Everybody hates you again. 
[01:14:30]  Well, it's just one of those things where people just don't take responsibility for their  own ass.  Well, it's an excuse for somebody else.  You know, it's this person's fault.  It's this person in the media.  I mean, are people really that stupid that they follow every single thing and take it  literal?  And even if the problem with this country, even if there's somebody out there that is  that stupid, sees the Sarah Palin map and goes, well, I know what I have to do now.  We're never going to have a perfect record.  There's going to be whack jobs out there.  Yeah.  There's millions of people that saw a taxi driver and one nut acted out on it. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  But there's people out there that now want us to ban, you know, would love if it happened  today, would love to ban the movie.  Ban the movie.  Meanwhile, over the years, how many more people have seen that?  Millions.  It's it's it's when it's we're never going to have a perfect record.  We're never going to be able to keep everyone under control.  Exactly.  Why does everyone look for the perfect record?  You've got to deal with the percentages, unfortunately, like let the bodies hit the floor.  OK, maybe not in this case, but maybe there was some lunatic out there that did hear that 
[01:15:30]  song and decide he had to do some shit.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, it's going to happen.  Do you think we're ever going to be 100 percent with murder where where people don't kill other  people for psychotic ideas?  There might be and you know what I go with, go the other way with this.  There might be a kook out there.  He watches SpongeBob SquarePants.  He goes, oh, fuck.  I know what I got to fucking do.  Go, Paul.  Why does it always have to be the obvious stuff, too?  It can be some weird ass shit. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  We don't even know about that is that is making that switch go off in a crazy person's head.  It's never going to be 100 percent.  And that's something I was also talking about with the run of Fez yesterday.  You can't expect to have a society, a free society as free as we are.  What?  What?  Sociote.  That's the only way I know.  I know.  And expect to have it work perfectly.  It doesn't.  When you give people freedoms, you open up yourself to certain dangers because you're 
[01:16:30]  giving people individual freedoms.  It just happens that way.  If you're in China, the government can absolutely run your life and say, you can have this.  You can't have that.  There's a person saying, don't talk about fucking China because you've never been there, my friend.  You don't know how good it is.  Let me tell you something.  You don't know.  Who do you think went over with Nixon?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You and the pandas?  Me.  With the pandas, Nixon, some cherry trees. 
[01:17:00]  I was right there.  Right there, huh?  With the pandas.  Right there with them.  Pandas.  Ying and chang.  It goes back to the violent video games.  I mean, they are selling violent video games like crazy.  And how many people are doing anything?  An extremely small percent.  But there are lawmakers out there that go, well, that's not good enough.  Oh, they think it's running rampant.  We need a perfect record here.  Perfect record.  We need no one to do crazy shit because they play violent video games.  That's not possible.  It's just not possible. 
[01:17:30]  Impossible.  You've got to deal with numbers.  If it was 50 percent.  Oh, crazy.  And they could actually prove it?  All right.  Then there's a problem.  But then I would give in and go, all right, man.  If it's point, a fuckload of zeros, and then a one.  Right.  You've got to eat it.  And I think in general that's what we're dealing with.  But unfortunately, the culture of fear, we go back to that.  The media sees that one fucking thing.  And, man, it's time to blow the fuck up.  They blow it up.  Blow it the fuck up and say, look, we've got a major problem in this country. 
[01:18:00]  And then people use it to their advantage and try to spin it for one side or the other, for political gain, for ratings, whatever it is.  But the bottom line is it's a country.  The country we live in is you could trade away your freedoms for safety.  You're never going to be 100 percent.  No.  But you could probably make it safer.  You could probably make it safer.  Take away all the guns, police state, curfews, perhaps. 
[01:18:30]  If there's curfews, nighttime curfews in inner cities to keep gangbangers off the streets, get the military in the inner cities.  Right.  There's plenty of solutions, but it's against what the fucking country is.  You can't do that.  It's illegal.  And you don't want to see the other side of that, what that means, when you keep everything so safe.  It's going to be a fucking boring-ass country.  Well, it's pretty boring.  I mean, we could talk about what we're experts in, radio.  Fascism.  What they did, a regular radio. 
[01:19:00]  Thank God you got the satellite and the internet is now taking off.  Yes, thank God for you.  They completely fucked regular radio over nothing.  Yeah.  Nothing.  They sanitized it.  No one was being affected by what Imus said.  And we've said, I understand we've talked about this a million times, but that's what we do know.  And look what they did.  They made it very boring for a lot of people in their cars.  That still don't have the satellite.  Yeah, now people are scared to do anything.  Have you tried listening to regular radio?  No.  It is unbelievable how bad it is. 
[01:19:30]  I'll be honest.  I listen to 1010 Winds and 88 News.  News is the only regular radio I listen to.  And they kicked everyone out with a personality, either a personality or a little edge.  A little edge.  You know, the only ones that survived are the political guys.  But that gets to be boring after a while, too.  Listening that day in and day out.  Yeah, unless something new was happening.  And it was based on nothing.  Yep.  Nothing.  Not a goddamn thing.  Nothing.  Maybe that small percent that you just said, the .0001, was affected by maybe something 
[01:20:00]  Imus said or maybe something Howard said back in the day.  Maybe something we did or said back in the day.  Yep.  Maybe.  And everyone else had a sacrifice because of that.  It's an embarrassment.  That's what really scares me.  It's a fucking embarrassment.  More importantly, did you see Hillary Clinton fucking fall on her fat ass?  Falling in her plane?  Can you play that for us, Danny?  Let me tell you something.  It's everywhere today.  Johnny on the spot with the plane lights, though, huh?  Yeah.  The lights on the plane. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  She falls on her fucking fat face.  It's hilarious.  And somebody in the plane hit the lights, so it completely darkened the inside of the plane.  Amazing.  I tweeted this really late last night, if you haven't checked it out yet.  It's great.  But Hillary walking up the stairs, she tripped over her own big fat ankles.  Was there ever a falling down that wasn't funny?  Never!  I don't know.  I yell all the time.  Why is everyone yelling?  We all love yelling in this place.  I do it at home now. 
[01:21:00]  Is that just a...  I just start yelling.  No!  That's her on the floor, yeah.  That's so great when she falls.  Let the fatty hit the floor.  Let the fatty hit the floor.  And somebody tweeted that she fell because of her elephant fucking cankles.  And I just...  I just laughed.  She saw a mouse and got scared.  She's walking up the stairs.  Yeah.  People are cheering.  All eyes are on her.  She's at the top of the stairs getting ready to walk into the plane.  Of course they have to have an ad.  Right before she falls. 
[01:21:30]  There she goes.  She spins around.  Gives the wave.  And...  And...  She falls in her face.  And look at this.  Look at this.  Someone cuts the lights in the plane.  It's great.  Why?  Probably so.  Let's see.  Come on.  So you can't see.  They're like, cut the lights.  Don't let anyone see in here.  God forbid we all see a real moment.  But that's Johnny on the spot, though, because it happened pretty quick.  Yeah, that guy's...  Cut those lights.  Fuck that.  Don't see her fall.  You might get one of those snatch shots.  One of those Lindsay Lohan snatch shots off of her. 
[01:22:00]  They probably always turn off the lights when she walks in.  If people are eating.  You don't want to see her fat lower half.  Oh, God.  Hey.  It's Mushy Cavs McGillicuddy.  McGillicuddy.  Did you see the song I tweeted yesterday?  It's so obnoxious.  And people are really mad at me.  Oh, wait.  For two seconds.  Go ahead.  Somebody...  Pat from Menaki brought this up.  Hillary was a Clint Van Dyke.  Whatever.  But it would be funny to mix that video with a...  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:22:30]  And have her fall right at the point where Dick Van Dyke falls at the beginning of a Dick Van Dyke show.  Someone get it done.  Someone do that.  I'll retweet whoever gets it done.  First person get it done.  It's easy.  Yeah.  That's an easy one.  Danny, there's an Arizona shooter song that I tweeted.  Really?  It's so obnoxious.  It's either catchy or the worst thing you'll ever hear.  Is it a tribute?  Is it a parody?  Is it something that's tasteless?  Is it touching? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, third down right there.  Is it like Mommy These For You?  Yeah, right here.  Listen to this.  Tell me what you think.  All right.  Let's listen.  All right.  Jared Lee Loftner's crazy as can be.  Knock him down and lock him up and throw away the key.  Knock him down and lock him up and throw away the key. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  Jared Lee Loftner screwed up in the brain, but they allowed him to purchase a weapon anyway.  Jared Lee Loftner, he has crazy eyes.  Better kill him now before another person dies.  Better kill him now before another person dies.  This guy looks like a problem.  All right.  Jared Lee Loftner, throw away the key. 
[01:24:00]  Throw away.  Everybody hopes that you get the death penalty.  I love the face you're making.  Love it.  Jared Lee Loftner, the public's not safe.  I'm making the butt head fair.  Because there's many more people like you out there anyway.  Because there's many more people like you out there anyway.  Is there many more people?  This guy is the king of the shoe horn.  All right.  What's he doing?  Jared Lee Loftner is a crazy guy.  Shot a bunch of bullets and a bunch of people died. 
[01:24:30]  Jared Lee Loftner's crazy as can be.  Knock him down and lock him up and throw away the key.  Knock him down and lock him up and throw away the key.  All right.  And with 3,278 views, wow, is he just tearing it up.  Yeah.  That's awful.  You know what, though?  You'll be humming that later.  No.  Yes, you will.  I forgot it already, I swear. 
[01:25:00]  Or you'll say all right to yourself.  I swear.  I've already forgotten it.  The guy is a hack.  He's a hack.  Hate that guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I like it's all right.  He's quite the rocker.  Oh, let me say hi to Tim.  This is breaking news.  Tim, go ahead, sir.  Hello, Tim.  Hello, guys.  Hey.  I want to let you know I just heard on the Weather Channel that Mayor Menino is supposed to be  making a special call to the Weather Channel to discuss the snowstorm. 
[01:25:30]  Can we get the Weather Channel on the top TV somehow?  I would hope we could.  I guess the mayor had his State of the City or the State of the State address.  Wait, he's the mayor of the...  State of the City?  He probably stayed at the City last night, so...  Yeah?  I want to take a peek at that audio.  Mayor Menino, I want to hear that.  I want to hear how bad he was mumbling last night.  There you go, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Have a good one.  Oh, we got it.  That's the Weather Channel.  Yeah.  We got everything you do.  Yeah, we could maybe get the audio down the hall.  That would be nice.  Mayor Menino calling into the Weather Channel. 
[01:26:00]  You ever watch a show on the Weather Channel?  They do shows like, ooh, tornadoes.  And you watch it, and it's the Weather Channel staff, and they're talking about it.  It's probably amongst the most boring thing you'll ever see in your life.  They do some numbers.  The Weather Channel?  They do some numbers.  Yeah, it's weather.  People like their weather.  Hey, we missed a great observation on Chris Matthews.  Travis will help us out here in Detroit.  Go ahead, Travis.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hello.  Chris Matthews is freaking out about people using targets because of their military symbolism. 
[01:26:30]  The name of his show is Crossfire.  That's God damn it.  What a good point.  Holy shit.  And it is, and I forgot to mention that.  God damn it.  What a good point.  See, yeah.  Crossfire is the name of his fucking show.  Oh, man, how did we miss that one?  And he opens up with a whole speech on crosshairs.  Crossfire.  Did you guys see Social Network?  Did you do your homework assignment last night?  Is he in, someone in today? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, we got one of the guys coming in.  Who?  Oh.  The guy that played the twins.  Well, I logged on to Facebook.  Well, oh, that's good.  That was good enough.  Yeah, I think that's enough research.  Yeah, certainly.  I saw.  Certainly.  Certainly is.  We got some friend requests.  Is that on yesterday's email?  Ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore.  That's what I do.  You ignored all the emails.  Yeah.  Friend requests.  I can't be bothered.  And don't beg me.  Why don't you accept me?  Because it's not real friendship. 
[01:27:30]  Get over it.  Like that dummy that killed herself and none of her Facebook friends came to her aid.  Is it good?  Because they're not real friends, dummy.  Dude, I hold on.  What did E-Rock bring in?  E-Rock, are all the tracks good and those are the best?  The ones highlighted are good.  I know that.  I'm not stupid.  They're all good.  The ones that are yellow are really very funny.  We got Mayor Thomas Menino, State of the City, 2011 in front of us that he did last night. 
[01:28:00]  We got nine clips of him being a mumbling mess.  Stuttering, muttering prick.  So why don't we take a break?  We'll get the social network guy in here for a little bit.  We'll do the Mayor Menino thing for a little bit.  Oh, is he here?  And then we're going home early.  You know why?  Because it's a snow day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We should go home early.  We got to.  It's crazy today.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get a Jim Brewer bit ready, please.  Opie and Anthony, the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, God.  I want to wish Smokin' Joe Frazier a very happy birthday today.  Smoldering Joe Frazier.  Star-studded birthdays today, Anthony.  You got the Joe Frazier.  He's 67.  Yeah.  You got the amazing Kreskin.  He's 76.  We miss the amazing Kreskin.  We used to do some good radio with that guy.  Rush Limbaugh, 60.  Is it the Rush Limbaugh?  Or is it a singer from the 50s?  The Rush Limbaugh.  All right.  I just want to make sure Travis didn't fuck up again.  Let's not forget that Kevin Bacon type bit we did yesterday. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Went over big time with the listeners.  Big time.  We got to do that again.  Also, Kirstie Alley is 56.  You got the Rob Zombie's birthday today, Sam.  45.  And a big happy birthday to Howard Stern down the hall.  How old's Howie?  I don't know.  I'm just going to say a big happy birthday.  Oh, okay.  That's what I do now.  Look what I do.  I remember...  Look what I do.  I remember when Howie was like 20...  27? 
[01:29:30]  His 27th birthday.  On the radio?  Celebrating.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was some sick shit.  That was back in like...  And WEMBC days.  Right.  I used to listen back in...  I guess I was 83, 84.  And I'd be washing dishes and listening to WEMBC.  Really?  Back in the olden days.  The two shows yesterday bumped into each other because we had our creative meeting.  So I'm talking to Fred for a little bit.  And then I see Jimmy and Howard having a nice little chit chat. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Small talk, you know.  That's nice.  But, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  We got the dude from the social network down the hall.  You want to go get him?  Oh, yeah.  Also, once again...  And I feel like an asshole because I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  But the listener was wrong.  Chris Matthews' show is not called Crossfire.  No.  And I know that.  I don't know why I went with the fucking caller.  His show's called Hardball.  Hardball.  Do you know a hardball can hurt you, though? 
[01:30:30]  It sure can.  It really can.  If really thrown hard at your head, it could hurt.  Q-ball is a hardball.  That's a hardball.  That could do some damage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, you know, we were making a fine point how he opens up his show about crosshairs  and then his show's called Crossfire.  And the fact is his show's not called Crossfire.  It's called Hardball.  And Crossfire was on CNN, and I knew that, and it's not on CNN anymore.  Was he ever on Crossfire?  No, because it was a CNN program.  Yeah, well, people go back and forth.  Who's going to be the guy that asks Army? 
[01:31:00]  Is his name Army?  He's coming down the hall.  Army Hammer.  A-R-M-I-E.  Army Hammer.  I keep thinking of Army.  Army Hammer.  Like the baking soda.  The social network.  I saw the movie recently, and I really liked it.  Roland.  Oh, look at that.  Army.  Fellas.  Army fucking Hammer in studio.  That's the guy.  What's going on, brother?  Take a seat.  How are you guys?  Have some fun.  Good, man.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hanging.  Yeah, you know. 
[01:31:30]  It's the morning.  You're not a Harvard preppy type of guy in real life, right?  No, hell no, dude.  I dropped out of high school and college.  Okay, because I hated your character in the social network.  But I think I was supposed to hate you guys a little bit, no?  A little bit.  I mean, it's funny, because people who watch a movie, they kind of associate, or they aside  with whoever they associate the most of themselves in.  So it's like, you're not a Harvard dude.  So you look at the Harvard dudes and you're like, those guys are a bunch of douchebags.  I am.  I'm a fucking SUNY guy.  I'm a Yale man myself.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I could tell it was the baby blue you're wearing now. 
[01:32:00]  Of course.  Yes, yes.  And I see the social network, and you're in the movie, and let me just say it this way,  and then I'll explain, with his twin brother, okay?  Right.  And I go through this whole movie going, wow, these two fucking guys were great in the social  network.  And then Roland has to tell me, and I'm embarrassed that I didn't know this, he goes, you know  that was one guy, and they CGI'd the twin brother in the movie.  I'm like, how the fuck do they do that?  How do they do that?  I don't get paid enough to know these things.  That's David Fincher's job.  He's like a, he is a technical wizard when it comes to that stuff. 
[01:32:30]  It was filmed brilliantly, by the way.  Oh, thanks, man.  He's just amazing.  But how do they do, how do they CGI you?  I don't get it.  Okay.  I get the basics of that shit, but how did you have to deal with that?  It was like a multi-part process that we did.  Part of the way we would do it is, it was always myself and another actor named Josh Pence,  and we'd be there together, and I'd always start as Cameron, you know, like the preppy  one with the updo and all that, like the gentleman of Harvard, and then Josh would start playing  Tyler Winklevoss, and then we'd shoot it until Fincher was happy, which could be, you 
[01:33:00]  know, 90 takes.  Wow.  Is he one of those guys?  Oh, yeah.  He's a shooter, for sure.  And then he'd say, okay, switch.  And then basically, I'd go change clothes, change hair, change makeup, sit where Josh  was seated, and everybody else would leave set, and they'd put a piece of tape on this  wall, and they'd go, that's your brother.  And they'd put a, you know, tennis ball over there, and they'd say, if you want to talk  to someone else, that's him there.  And basically, I'd put an earwig in my ear that had an audio recording of myself.  They put creatures in our bodies.  Wow, that is...  So I ended up playing both parts for some of it, and then for the other part, they would 
[01:33:30]  just use Josh Pence's body, and then I'd go in and do like the Benjamin Button thing,  and the special effects, and basically put my face on it.  I now want to go back and see the social network again to see if I could tell.  Yeah.  Well, dude, I was not allowed to talk about this before the movie came out.  Like, Sony was like, you cannot talk about the twins.  You've got to make believe you've got a twin brother.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they didn't want anyone like you going to the movie going, okay, I'm going to find  where it doesn't work.  Right.  To see where it doesn't work or whatever.  Yeah.  Damn, that's amazing shit.  Yeah, dude, it was fun shit, that's for sure. 
[01:34:00]  And, well, it's twice the work for you.  I hope you got a little, you know, extra scratch for that.  Yeah, you get paid for two people.  I get paid half, and I never forget.  Oh, half.  Yeah, how does that work?  Wait a minute.  No, you're doing two roles, you get paid half.  Yeah.  Oh, that sucks.  You want to explain the social network for the people out there?  Yeah, sure.  It's a movie that's, I mean, it's about Facebook, but it's not really about Facebook,  because who the hell wants to see a movie only about Facebook?  That's not very funny.  I've got to jump in for one second.  I think what hurts the movie, even though it's doing great numbers, obviously, so maybe this doesn't 
[01:34:30]  even mean shit, I don't like the name of the social network for this movie, because there's  so much more going on.  Yeah.  Well, but also, if you think about it, it is the social network.  It is Facebook.  Yeah.  So it's like, if you say the social network, people will know, oh, it's Facebook.  I would like to see a movie about Facebook, though, where it's like a guy, and the camera's  on him, and he's just going like, ignore, ignore, and it's like, confirm, confirm, I'll  take that friend, and then you're like, no, no, I'm not taking that one, and just the thrill  of like, is he going to take this person? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, getting to be exclusive with your friends online, man.  And then they can CGI like another twin, and he's going like, I'm going to take the guy  you ignored.  Yeah.  I'd watch two and a half hours of that.  Thrill a minute.  Yeah.  Well, maybe they could show every girl you meet you thought wasn't fat, turns out she  is, but she has that great profile shot.  The one at the up angle, so you can't, you're just like, oh, she's got big tits, and then  you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Well, she's on the beach, and it was taken from like four miles out.  The doe eye look looking up. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Like, oh, Christ.  The doe eyes and body of a moose.  Voodoo shots.  I love those.  Yeah.  Are you on the Facebook, as they say?  No, I'm not.  I'm immune.  Really?  Yeah, I was.  I mean, before I dropped out of college, I had a Facebook, and because, I mean, that's sort  of like the digitalized dorm now.  Yeah, you can't have a socialized in college if you don't have a Facebook.  Right, yeah.  So I did have a Facebook, but then, you know, like everybody else, I just started spending  too much time on there, and I'm like, wait a second, if the power in my house died, this  would all go away, and it wouldn't even exist, so I'm kind of over it. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, but where's the power going?  Come on.  Have some fun.  We're in New York.  It could go any moment.  If the power goes, we're all fucked.  What are you doing?  Anarchy.  You should enjoy Facebook until that happens.  What have you traded it in for anything?  Twitter?  What do you do?  No, nothing.  I'm social network free.  You just don't do anything.  You're off the grid, as they say.  Maybe that, maybe I'm just lazy.  And you're one of the stars of the social network.  That doesn't make sense.  I want to get back to this.  So you're a dropout, but you play a...  CB radio is what it is.  You're a college dropout, but you play a Harvard douchebag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And explain the movie further, because...  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  It's basically the story of a bunch of young guys with more money and brains than sense,  who all around the same time come up with great ideas.  And these two Winklevoss twins come up to an underclassman named Mark Zuckerberg and say,  we have an idea for a site.  It's this, this, this.  It's based on exclusivity.  Will you help us build it?  And he goes, yeah, I'll do that.  Takes all of their research, and they never see him again.  And then something like 43 days later, or something like that, please don't quote me.  I'm not an expert.  He launches Facebook, his website. 
[01:37:00]  And then all of a sudden, they're like, dude, you just...  That was our idea.  That's our idea, you bastard.  Wow.  So then it's sort of about the battle that happened in the beginning and how they grew  the company, Mark Zuckerberg's brilliant strategy for expanding it.  But at the end of the day, it's not a movie about Facebook.  It's a movie about all of the major themes that are about any story.  It's like class, power struggle, the need to be loved, the need to be accepted.  All these things that we deal with every day put in like a 21st century, you know, presentation. 
[01:37:30]  Whose angle is this, by the way?  Because I'm sure Zuckerberg would go, hey, man, that's not how it went.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I'm sure that if anyone made a movie about you when you were 19 and it  wasn't from only your point of view, you'd go, wait, no, that's not how it was.  But whose take is this?  We approach everybody's take as if they believe it like it's the truth.  Has Zuckerberg commented on this movie?  I don't know.  Yeah.  He said a couple of things.  I think he's played it cool.  I think he said like, well, I definitely they definitely got the clothes right or something 
[01:38:00]  like that.  That was pretty much what he found out of.  He seems like he comes across as a weirdo in the movie.  Socially inept.  Yeah.  I would say he's definitely socially inept.  At least he comes across the way.  Maybe ironic.  Maybe borderline autistic.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you could say like you could say Aspergian for sure.  That's what I was going to say.  Yeah.  But like it's funny that the one guy who seems to have no social skills is better at like  compartmentalizing and putting the entire social setting online.  Right.  Right.  You know, I mean, maybe it's funny because he doesn't know how to socialize. 
[01:38:30]  He studied it so much more than people who are able to just naturally do it.  But it is kind of what Facebook and the other social networking things are about.  It really isn't about honest relationships and knowing somebody.  It's just pretty mechanical and just, hey, oh, how many friends do you have?  None.  None of them are your friends, dummy.  A lot of fake friends.  Their names, their pictures, and their profiles.  You're all just friend collectors.  Admit it.  I have so many friends, do you?  No, I don't think so.  Yeah.  Jimmy loves having a lot of friends on Facebook. 
[01:39:00]  No, I actually had to get into a lot because there were some questionable friends.  My girlfriend was like, how do you know her?  I'm like, oh, really?  You know, she's a nice girl from Arkansas who I've never met.  I just accept friends randomly.  Like, I'll just go down the list.  And surprisingly enough, they're all girls.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm like, yeah, it's just who contacts me.  You know, no guys.  They're all fat girls with doe eyes.  Yes, doe eyes looking over the camera.  The other thing I learned from the social network is that Napster guy was involved.  I did not know that.  I forgot his name.  Where's Sean? 
[01:39:30]  Sean Parker.  Sean Parker, remember Napster guy?  Where has he been?  He had a stake in this whole company, and then the movie shows how he fucked it up.  And I don't give that away.  It shows how he sort of inserted himself.  And he still has a tiny percent of Facebook, but he was going to have a nice big percent  before he did what he did.  I think he's got like, don't quote me, I think he's got like 7% of the company.  Or is it less than that?  Opie, less, more?  I want to go with 1%.  1%?  Whoa!  I don't know, though, now I'm confused. 
[01:40:00]  Higher, higher!  Yeah.  I think they really knocked his percent of a $30 billion company.  That's what I'm saying.  We haven't seen him because he's on an island somewhere.  He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.  At 51, I guess, right?  He knocked it down at 51%, so he has control, but...  Yeah.  I heard he still lives in like a regular house with his girlfriend, like...  Because he's a weirdo.  An average house.  And apparently, he slept just like on a mattress on a floor for like a long time.  Why?  Because he's comfortable there?  Or that's just...  Or if he's OCD?  Sometimes OCD people don't change things.  I'm telling you, he's borderline autistic, and that's what it's all about. 
[01:40:30]  He doesn't really care about money like the Irish person does.  No.  That's crazy.  That's what I got from this movie.  That's the guys who make...  Although Bill Gates is pretty ruthless.  So like Bill Gates, business-wise, was ruthless.  So he cared about money.  But a lot of guys who don't care about it are the ones who make the billions.  Right.  Said the guy who needed something to say.  Bill Gates gives a lot away.  Yeah.  Bill Gates also has like that nice look in his eye.  You look at him and you're like, oh, he probably wouldn't intentionally wrong you.  He would screw me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Then he puts you over the table and really rapes you.  Bill Gates doesn't play games.  And when you were rowing in the movie there. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  With your twin brother.  Yeah.  I gotta get back to that.  How the...  What the fuck?  I don't get it.  That was...  What they're doing with these fucking movies.  It was...  I don't know why they didn't just hire...  Normal Twins.  It would have made it so much easier for all of us.  You must have been that damn good with your audition, I guess.  Or I was the only actor in Hollywood who was actually 6'5".  So...  Why not change the story to say it was about one guy at Harvard?  Fuck the twin angle.  They always...  They always change things in movies anyway.  Oh, man.  The twins would have been so pissed.  It's like they got skipped over on Facebook.  Now in the movie, they get fucked again. 
[01:41:30]  Have you met the real twins?  I did.  I met them after we finished Principal Photography, which was really strange.  He was like, oh, oh, there's two of you.  Like, this is great.  I mean, he's got a great neck for the cloning tool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what he's got.  He could easily be incorporated on another body.  Yeah.  Are they Harvard douchebags?  Okay, here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  See, you gotta see the movie, because he's so hateable, because he's always gotten everything  in his life, this guy.  Here's the thing.  These twins, they come from, you know, they come from a wealthy background. 
[01:42:00]  The real twins or your twins?  The real twins.  They come from, like, a wealthy background.  They went to Harvard.  You know, they have all these things going for them.  And in the movie, when you hear someone say, like, we are gentlemen of Harvard.  Like, we can't do that.  It seems like a somewhat romantic notion.  But when you hear someone talking like that in real life, you're kind of like, really,  dude?  Yeah.  Really?  You want to be that guy?  Snobby kind of a thing.  And the real twins ended up rowing in the Olympics.  Yeah.  I know a lot about this movie.  I am.  Sixth best rowers in the entire world. 
[01:42:30]  Fifth and sixth or sixth and seventh?  I think sixth and sixth.  I think it's a twin thing.  It's a twin thing.  Yeah, but that's not a medal, so who's going to ever remember that except them?  Yeah.  There's a lot of Oscar buzz around this movie, too.  I mean, they're already talking about it being...  Yeah, what?  I should say nominated, but...  I think it has a really good chance at best picture.  Director?  What if the other twins...  What if the other twin guy wins?  What'll you do?  Yeah, the CGI gets the award.  Dude, Josh Pence was the other guy. 
[01:43:00]  He deserves it, man.  He's like the unsung hero of the movie.  He was there every day I was there, working every day we all were, and unfortunately just  had his face replaced.  And just never is seen.  He walks down the street and just is like, ah, the guy is in the movie.  And he acted in the fucking movie.  Yeah, he didn't, but he got a cameo, too.  He did.  Okay, do you remember the scene where it was like the first scene they get groupies and they  get the blowjobs in the bathroom?  Yes.  And the guy's about to come in the bathroom and they're like, oh,  sorry, girls are cleaning up there.  And he's like, sweet.  That's Josh.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  He got a cameo.  Yeah.  He came a little bomb. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  That's cool.  I haven't seen it, but I already like it after hearing that great description.  Facebook groupie, I guess that when they started to hit big, you got a couple billion  dollars, man.  You didn't get blown in the bathroom.  That's the beauty of money.  I'm really adding nothing to this conversation, but I do, now I have to see the movie.  Hey, did you meet Trent Reznor?  I did.  I met him at the Palm Springs Film Festival a couple days ago.  I actually ended up sitting next to him at a table and I was like, holy shit.  You know, because I have always been a huge fan.  Like, meeting that guy was insane. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  He did the music for the movie.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  The music's really good.  Off the subject, years ago, my girlfriend had a Trent Reznor fetish.  She loved him and she said she used to masturbate thinking about me and him having sex.  No.  I swear to God.  A girl I dated who just actually contacted me recently.  Now that I've met him, that is the strangest visual I've ever seen.  I don't know how anyone masturbates to that.  I don't even know what he looks like.  I know who he is, but I don't know what he looks like, but I just, I know that it was  a creepy fantasy.  You'd dig him.  Would I?  No, I'm not gay.  You'd bang him.  I'm not gay.  Hey, Luke, why'd you have to say that?  Because he doesn't know me. 
[01:44:30]  He might just think that I'm really an unattractive little fruit.  There you go.  That's new Trent.  Oh, I thought he had long hair.  Yeah, he used to.  You got to go a little older, Trent.  Wait, so now they're saying Sean Parker was a co-founder.  He wasn't the famous Napster guy?  It was the Napster guy, wasn't he?  Yeah, well, I think there were two guys involved in the Napster.  It was like Sean Parker and Sean Fanning, I think, was the other guy.  Oh, my fucking Lord.  So maybe Sean Parker did the same thing in Napster that he did with Facebook, just kind  of weaseled his way in.  I thought it was the main Sean that we all know, but it's the other Sean that we don't  hear about much.  I don't know. 
[01:45:00]  I'm really confused again.  It's like that cherry guy from yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  Who's the cherry guy?  I don't know.  That's a long story.  It's Travis throwing up someone's birthday.  I thought it was a Canadian hockey guy, and it was a jazz guy from the 50s.  So there were two Napster guys named Sean.  I did not know that until right now.  All right.  Sorry about that, too.  What else are you working on?  What else have you been in?  You're kind of new on this scene.  Yeah, I am, dude.  I am, definitely.  My next thing is...  That's why he's so nice to us. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't hate my job yet.  I'm not jaded.  You're way too nice, which means you just got in the business.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't wait until he really hits, and then a bunch of publicists are in here just saying,  he's got to go.  Cut it out now.  Yeah, yeah.  So far, I'm still new to this, so the publicists are just waiting in the hallway.  Oh, she's on her BlackBerry, checking her face.  She doesn't know what's going on.  Checking all the clients.  Yeah.  The more important ones.  Who's this army guy?  What a weird name.  Next, I'm working with Clint Eastwood on a movie he's doing called J. Edgar. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, goodbye.  Goodbye, Les.  We'll see you.  Yeah, next time I'll be with publicists.  See you guys.  That's it.  Goodbye.  Who are you playing?  Are you playing Clive Tolson?  Clive, yeah.  Oh, Clive Tolson.  That was his second-in-command over there that it was rumored that he was homosexual with  for his entire Clyde Tolson anniversary.  Are you going to be doing homosexual stuff?  Well, I can say that I'll be playing Clive Tolson.  That's about as much as I can say right now.  Who's playing Edgar?  Let's see who he has to make out with.  Who's playing Edgar?  Leonardo DiCaprio is playing Edgar.  Oh, man. 
[01:46:30]  You're a lucky man.  Oh, you're a lucky devil.  What a lucky man.  He looks...  Edgar was a three.  They should have got Danny DeVito to play J. Edgar.  He was...  Then again, DiCaprio kind of has, like, weird, like, bigger eyes.  Maybe he could pull it off.  Oh, yeah.  He's a pig.  No, no, but I mean...  Oh, yeah.  Just a slouch.  Dude, he's a tall...  Girl, chicks hate him.  He looks nothing...  J. Edgar Hoover was an ugly dude.  And DiCaprio is...  DiCaprio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's not...  Yeah, that seems like some weird casting.  Well, he played Howard Hughes also. 
[01:47:00]  And Howard Hughes wasn't, you know...  Wow.  But also, I think, you know, J. Edgar's supposed to be shorter, I think.  And Leo's probably six foot, six foot one or so.  So I'm six five, so that'll handle...  Oh, actually, he does look just...  He actually does just...  Looks just like him.  Yeah, here's the...  You might think this is DiCaprio if I didn't tell you who it is.  Oh, the resemblance is striking, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why?  What's the matter?  Wasn't William Frawley available?  Apparently not.  And Charlize Theron?  I don't know that she's actually doing it.  Okay, because they got it on the IMDb already. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Look, they got you right there, Armie Hammer.  Hey, have you met Clint yet?  No.  Have not met...  I haven't met anybody in the process, and I start shooting in less than a month.  Wow.  Yeah.  A totally, totally different approach.  Like, Clint doesn't meet with actors before he casts them.  He casts everything on tape.  You know, he's just...  He's old school, man.  That's fucked up, man.  Are you nervous about meeting him?  I mean, it is Clint.  Yes, yes.  Like, I'll say, I'm nervous.  It's not in, like, the debilitating sense, but in, like, the, man, I got to bring my good shit seriously, you know?  So, it's motivating, for sure. 
[01:48:00]  Are you practicing your opening line for Clint?  I'm practicing my gay face.  Here's what you should say to Clint.  He'll love this.  Just say, hey, go ahead, make my day.  Yeah.  Okay, you're fired.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It's pretty much it.  Shortest day of work ever.  Who's playing Melvin Purvis?  I don't know who's playing Melvin Purvis.  Charlize Theron.  Wow, dude, good.  I've read a lot about the FBI.  Melvin Purvis, G-Man.  Melvin Purvis was an agent that they said that Edgar liked and was very attracted to.  He was a naughty boy. 
[01:48:30]  But they couldn't kill him.  You couldn't kill J. Edgar because he had shit on everybody.  He had files on all the Kennedys and everybody.  So, they were afraid that if they killed him, his files would pop up.  That's why he was able to.  You should have played him.  At least in the way, at least in the way, like, in the way they kind of presented from  everything I've seen is that he'd show up at the president's office and be like,  sir, this is a matter of national security.  Here's a recording of I have your wife doing so and so and so and so.  I just want you to have this.  And the guy would be like, give me that. 
[01:49:00]  He's like, okay, but just so you know, I have an extra copy so it's safe.  Just in case, so it's safe.  Yeah, it's like, oh, God, we want to.  And he was like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what it was.  And he would present it like he was a friend.  And he hated, I think he hated Bobby Kennedy because, like, Edgar would go right to the  president.  But then when Kennedy was the attorney general, he was like, no, no, no, you come to me.  And we fucking hated Robert Kennedy.  I don't think he was fond of JFK either.  I don't think that lasted that long.  Whoopsie.  Yeah.  Clyde Tyson, wow. 
[01:49:30]  So, yeah, working with Clint Eastwood is going to, that's like a completely different  approach to directing, obviously.  Oh, totally.  How much experience do you have with acting and directing?  What have you done so far?  I've been in this business for six years or so.  Yeah?  And, you know.  That's relatively short, though.  Yeah, and, you know, as it goes for the first five and a half of them, I spent, you know,  on an uphill battle with people kicking dirt in my face.  Yeah.  And then finally someone like David Fincher comes along and goes, hey, you want a shot? 
[01:50:00]  And I'm like, yes, I do.  Thank you.  And then it all kind of...  But let's slow down a little bit.  That five and a half years, what's some of the horse shit you had to do?  Oh.  Oh, well, now I can't say after you follow.  I can't follow with horse shit.  Horse shit.  I have a way of saying it.  Yeah.  The way you should say this, like, your experience...  You should have just said morning radio.  This show?  Yeah, exactly.  This is like the last...  This is still part of the climb.  Yeah.  This is some of the horse shit you will be...  Believe me.  ...hurtling.  Five minutes after the Clint handshake, we're wiped away from his memory. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  Oh, those dirt bags.  All right.  Make believe I didn't say that, and Jimmy will ask a different question.  Because, you know, I understand some of the struggles.  So, coming up, what are some of the things you had to do to this point?  I mean, they're probably not all pleasant.  Yeah, no.  I did some TV work.  I worked on a show called Gossip Girl.  That sounds like shit.  Oh, well.  I'm just kidding.  Our own Rowan is a big fan of Gigi.  Rowan's a big fan.  He calls it Gigi.  And some very attractive ladies on the Gossip Girl.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  That is one of the draws. 
[01:51:00]  That was really interesting, shooting in New York.  Because, you know, New York's a hustle and bustle city, and all of a sudden you're shooting  a show, and you're walking through the middle of, like, Park Avenue, and they've stopped traffic.  And you're just like, are you freaking kidding me?  This is crazy.  So, that was, like, a fun experience.  Yeah, you know what's even crazier?  Trying to drive around that bullshit.  Fucking pain in the ass.  Trailers.  You're like, oh, there's cops directing you down a street with 8,000 cars on it.  Thank you.  Yeah, you're welcome.  Yeah, that was all me.  You're welcome.  No problem.  Yeah, yeah.  I did a great show that I love working on called Reaper on, you know, the Warner Brothers. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, just, you know, little jobs here and there, you know.  How was DiCaprio?  Have you met him yet?  No.  I haven't met him.  I saw him in a sushi restaurant.  I wanted to follow him out like a girl and yell, Leo would get a photo.  My girlfriend's like, I couldn't.  I would have to, everyone would have known what I was doing.  But I think you have to do that one.  It's Leo.  I didn't do it, though, because I knew the place he's in.  Every time I'm there, I see celebrities.  And it's like, I know that they go there not to be bothered.  And normally.  Why do you go there?  Because, again, I'm hoping to catch one in the men's room for a photo. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I kind of regret not getting DiCaprio, though.  I'm like, you should have followed him out.  That's a big one, yeah.  The biggest.  Who's bigger than DiCaprio?  She's been in some shit.  Yeah, seriously.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's a big part you got in this?  Yeah.  Clyde Tolson was his fella.  That's cold.  He's listed third on IMDB for that moment.  With DiCaprio, who's second?  Is Charlie second?  Yeah, but I just had to respect it.  I don't even think she's doing it.  Does that mean I get bumped up one?  Yeah, you're up.  Well, it depends on what one they put in there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who is she playing?  Who is that part for?  It was for Helen Gandy, his secretary. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, okay.  He never got married, did he?  Like the bachelor life.  Yeah, yeah.  You know how it is with the guy.  Yeah, you know, bachelor.  Hey, just living alone, living the life.  I heard he enjoyed some naughty parties.  Yeah.  Some fresh parties.  Oh, really?  What'd you hear?  This is my research phase.  Yeah, what'd you hear?  The same type of parties, allegedly, that David Ferry would go to back in the old days.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're a handsome man, Mr. Gasson.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  Like that type of stuff, yeah.  Really naughty parties.  Oh, fantastic.  All right, I'm reading the one sheet, and Arrested Development, I love that show. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, that was fun.  I got to work an episode on that.  What were you?  That was like my first ever job on TV, and I played, you guys ready for this?  Student number two.  All right.  Student number two.  All right.  And you know what?  I nailed it.  Nailed the shit out of it.  You were a student.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Number two.  Okay, so, and the other thing I see on your sheet here, your father, oh, your great-grandfather  was an oil tycoon? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Armand Hammer, you know that guy?  Armand Hammer?  Not the company.  You know Armand Hammer?  Yeah.  I know Armand Hammer.  As the oil tycoon?  That's huge.  Yeah.  My great-grandfather was doing it.  Because I was wondering, like, Armie Hammer, I'm like, there was another guy with a name  that was like, it sounded like Armand Hammer.  Yeah.  And it was Armand Hammer.  You don't have to work.  Oh, okay.  Wait a minute.  This guy doesn't have to work.  Did you get some of that oil money?  If I wanted to go into business and go to business school and do all that stuff, I could  have had an easy life.  But instead, I turned my back and all that, and basically my parents were like, you're going 
[01:54:00]  to be an actor?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, really?  I was kind of on my own for a while.  At least you got some of that oil money to fall back on.  They didn't support you at first?  That would have been nice, yeah.  They didn't support you?  No, not really.  I mean, they were supportive.  They were as supportive as parents could be who really hated what their child was doing.  So instead of having $100 million in the bank, you probably only have $10.  That sucks.  But he sucks.  You're the member of the family that, until a couple of months ago, was the idiot and  the mistake maker.  And now you're like, this guy's great.  He's ours.  Yeah, that's how it is.  Hey, look at him.  He's doing a movie.  It was two things.  I got cast a couple years ago to play Batman in a movie called Justice League that never 
[01:54:30]  ended up happening.  And that was the moment that my dad was like, attaboy!  And then after that, I got cast to play Billy Graham in a really small independent film  that never really did anything.  But that's when my mom was like, I'm so proud of you.  So I was like, that's cool.  You've gone out of that oily business.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was actually, it was once I proved that I wanted to be an actor, not so I could just  like sit around and smoke pot and watch movies all day, but because this is what I'm passionate  about and what I love.  That's when my parents were like, okay, you know what? 
[01:55:00]  We don't get it, but you know, you're now our novelty son who at party we can go, this  is our good son, Victor.  He's a businessman.  And this is our crazy ass son, Armie.  He's an actor, you know?  But it would have been business wise.  You wouldn't have been a roughneck or anything, right?  Well, actually, it's funny.  When my dad started working for my great grandfather, he started him out as a roughneck.  Really?  He was like, if you're going to work for me, you're starting at the bottom.  You've got to know what the business is about before you can run it.  Yeah.  Well, so you think you would have had to been there losing some fingers on some of those pipes?  Yeah.  Probably.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  That's too much like real work. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you've got a brother that is a business guy.  Yeah.  My brother, Victor, he's very much like the business dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank God for him.  But you know what?  Now, at Family Functions, everybody wants to search you out.  Look what happened to you.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah.  They don't want to talk about oil.  They want to talk about Hollywood.  You're family in big oil, man.  Did you hate that?  It's like, you're sorry.  We use it.  Once my great-grandfather died, our involvement with, you know, Occidental, which was the oil  company, really just started to... 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, Occidental Petroleum.  Yeah.  I remember that.  It started to just like peter out.  I mean, like you said, the oil business, that's a crazy, crazy world to run in.  So my dad wanted to spend time with his family.  And it was kind of really before it was completely run by the Arabs.  Yeah.  So Occidental was a huge fucking petroleum company, man.  Yeah.  That was like the one.  Yeah.  And wow.  I think it was like one of the largest producers in the 80s.  Yeah.  Huge.  I don't know how you turn your back on that.  What an idiot.  If this wouldn't have worked out for me, I would take that to the chin. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  If you were like on some stage in fucking Missouri, it would have been like, God, what  are you doing?  Wow.  That's a set of balls, man.  That's cool.  Unfortunately, Armie Hammer's got to go.  He's got to do TV.  But there is one thing, and maybe you'll comment, because people are talking about this.  Superman?  Shortlist?  I got nothing to comment on, unfortunately.  Shortlist?  I mean, I went in.  I talked to the guys, and...  There's rumors that he's on the shortlist to be Superman.  I see this S right under his button there.  You can see it.  He's wearing this shit right now. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  No comment on that?  He's just my hoodie pajamas that I wear all the time.  You got a good shot at it?  You think you did well?  I mean, between you and me, and, well, all your listeners, I don't really think so.  They don't listen, really.  Yeah.  You got a look.  Oh, you don't think so?  I don't know, man.  I think I'm probably too young for what they need.  Really?  I think they need someone a little bit...  I mean...  A little older?  Who wants to see, like, a mid-twenties Superman?  Everyone's going to be like, who's this little whippersnapper?  You know, you need, like, a Superman.  Who's this Smallville?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Even though I think Tom Welling's, like, 40 now at this point.  Oh, I know.  It ended up being like, okay, this show is Superman now. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck happened?  Are you 6'5", really?  Yeah.  I'm really happy he doesn't want to bang my girlfriend.  I'd be in trouble.  I wouldn't be mad at her.  I'd be like, eh, all right.  So would I?  My wife would beat the shit out of me.  Are you married?  Okay, good.  All right, let's get him out of here.  He's got to be married if he's going to take that next role.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Seriously.  You don't want those rumors going around.  Or, you know, maybe you do, because there's nothing wrong with it.  Especially in Hollywood.  Yes.  Armie Hammer, man.  This was really cool.  The Social Network.  He plays the twins.  One guy playing the twins. 
[01:58:00]  It's a great movie.  I saw it recently and loved it.  Yeah, best of luck.  We'll keep our eyes on your career and never see you again.  It's going to be great.  I'm looking forward to it very much.  Fantastic.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Armie Hammer, man.  Thanks for coming in.  Because he mentioned Clint Eastwood, I think we're going to replay the Jay Moore-Clint Eastwood  story.  It's a classic.  And when we get back, Amy Schumer.  Stay there.  I have a quick anecdote for you, and then I'd like to go back to bed.  Okay, buddy.  When I was doing Hereafter with Clint, I saw you guys when this happened.  I haven't meaning to talk to you for a while.  When I did Hereafter with Eastwood with my big poofy hair, there's a scene where I go 
[01:58:30]  up like three flights of stairs, and this lady's supposed to hand me a letter from Matt  Damon, who plays my brother, right?  And the lady just, all she's supposed to do is open her door as I take my keys out, because  it's an apartment building.  It's supposed to go, this is your brother.  This is from your brother.  And I'm supposed to take it, I open it, I read it, and it's terrible news, and I just  stare out into space, right?  So I woke up three flights of stairs, I go down the hallway, and this lady, like, we're  in San Francisco shooting this movie, this lady's like a local hire, and she's going to 
[01:59:00]  get her goddamn Oscar, right?  She steps out of her apartment, closes her apartment door behind her and goes, hey, hey,  Billy, yeah, you're, well, and she's like waving the fucking letter like she's Blanche  Dubois, like it's too hot and all the way for her, and she goes, well, uh, looks like  your brother left you this, it's your mail, here you go, you're welcome, and she hands  it out to me, and I go to reach for it, and she pulls it back a little, like to be a cunt,  and then I reach for it more, and then finally I just snatch it out of her hand, and then 
[01:59:30]  I open it, and then she goes back in, and then without yelling cut, Clint Eastwood just  goes, oh, hold on a second, everybody, and you hear him, like, going up three flights,  he's fucking 80,000 years old, he goes up, like, four flights of stairs, and he just  goes, sweetheart, honey, come on out here, and the lady comes out, and he goes, I cannot  express to you how little this movie is about you.  Holy shit.  Wow.  He goes, he takes the letter out of my hand and hands it back to her, he goes, I mean,

[02:00:30]  creak, you can hear the fucking wheel on the camera, like, you can hear-you can hear  nothing.  You can hear a goddamn thing.  It's so cold and quiet, and, like, holy shit, like, I've never seen him say-he doesn't  talk, let alone come up and blast somebody.  That is real-that is a sound thrashing.  Did you think she was embarrassed?  oh that was not about her oh fantastic all you heard was him going down three flights

[02:14:00]  challenges behind us the big ones that remain to tackle i am relentless optimistic about 2011  i am relentless optimistic i'm upbeat but i'm prospects confident and our neighborhoods  energized for the coming days energized he's missing words he really is leaving him out it sounds like  in high school when you're like let's get the down syndrome kid to run for president yeah so he has 
[02:14:30]  to make a speech right not that we did that but we did that two years i never realized yeah he almost  won he would have won the school was like he can't win i never realized manino was so far ahead of his  time because he's speaking in uh twitter yeah it's as many as many characters as you could use  140 characters and twitter so uh he's a genius he said how did he say neighborhoods or he said  neighbors i don't want to hear that neighbors let me do this 2011 i'm upbeat but i'm prospects 
[02:15:00]  confident and i neighbors energized for the coming days neighborhoods neighborhoods i love that  i remember being in the neighborhood once i went camping in the neighborhood what an ass oh please  keep them going love mayor menino oh boy this is a doozy we trained 2200 more teachers to teach  english learners we launched our internet english learners what one of them couldn't work with you 
[02:15:30]  i know right he's talking about english oh but he said he checked it in the day english do you speak  it what what's happening now sam is sam is sam is it sam he got to the bottom of the e-rock  little cug rag you know it's not that i wanted to make sure there wasn't we didn't have messed up  equipment issues yeah of course that's smart on your part sam so you got to the bottom of it yeah  because what do you know well it's not it was that was his motivation by the way yeah not hanging eric 
[02:16:00]  out to drive and thank god it was indeed operator error  did he nagle it he nagle the shit out of that disc that disc was not checked no no it was a data  disc it was mp3 let's go back to e-rock why would you say it was when it wasn't checked it was because  when i burned it and i put it back in the system it popped up on the but he put it through a media  player he said which plays data discs right and it says dot mp3 at the end of it right right it  would say dot mp3 so you didn't look at that so he didn't even see that much it didn't say that it 
[02:16:30]  just said zero it said dot ngl which is a nagle file hold on sam he's saying it did not say that  well i mean it obviously did and also generally speaking the way you would check to see if a cd  works in a cd player would be to throw it in a cd player you got it man yeah yeah  this is a fun game show it really is it's like you gotta guess leave eric alone we've only been 
[02:17:00]  doing this for like six years relax give him some time he'll figure it out iraq comment iraq  no comment there's steam coming out of his ears in there oh there's fork too sorry iraq i didn't  mean that that was a cheap shot so cold-blooded but iraq what about like he's saying he's basically  saying that you didn't check it that you were just saying that yeah yeah yeah no i did check it i did  not how come it didn't say mp3 after like it would on every single computer in the country  it didn't it said track one two three four now if you put that in there now where is it where is 
[02:17:30]  that disc now it's in the office can you put it in and see if it shows mp3 what i just did yeah  that's how it shows mp3 so why didn't it show it also five minutes ago when he put it in when you  flip the disc over you know you can see what's been burned on the yeah yeah yeah it's far too short to  be nine tracks of audio iraq uh are you familiar with the length of um tracks what it looks like  on the back of a dvd when it's been or cd when it's been burned yes and and did you think that  it looked a little short no i didn't no there's welcome to the most boring episode of law and order 
[02:18:00]  you know i gotta go with iraq on this one it's law and order me a giant sandwich  drive through an order drive through an order it's law and mess mess up the order of something  sam i think iraq's got you on this one i really don't based on what i heard what iraq gotta say 
[02:18:30]  he burned it he fucking blew it he made it he made a good argument there he made no law and order  what are the specials unit  now guys he's on the south beach  that's not what this is about anyway that's unfair no no it is you're right you're right sam 
[02:19:00]  so sam he fucked up yeah but i mean what i'm trying to get at is the operator error works  yeah operator right operator error you're focusing on the positive the equipment works is what i was  in here to say you never want to hear operator no no how's the diet theory iraq south beach doing  you well it's it's going you look svelte wait what is what is what is svelte means i mean fast  but what oh what is going what is yeah it's going mean it's it sucks there's a lot of shit that  you can't have i can't have a lot of carbs right now so that's really yeah a tough time 
[02:19:30]  what what what have you wanted that you haven't been able to treat yourself not having carbs is a  tough time yeah it is no everything comes on bread so when you you can't have bread all the time i  have a little bit of some starving african about how tough it would be to not have carbs yeah just  like anthony goes out the streets and talks all the starving africans all the time i say get out of  my way exactly yeah delivery drivers exactly what have you wanted to have sweetie that you 
[02:20:00]  haven't been able to have roland just yells food uh no bread's hard um you know what eric's  weaknesses are soda sandwiches he loves his sandwiches cereal too yeah yeah not too big on  cereal no like are you drinking water at least yeah water and iced tea and really stop with the  iced tea no iced tea he says oh my god he drives your mouth out it's gross meaning there's water in  the iced tea yes he pours powder in his water when you drink water do you watch for the crocodiles 
[02:20:30]  see he's like a water buffalo  oh my god that's terrible the explanations are the best i was actually gonna just add another  thing to the crocodiles because but that's it i'm like i guess all right let's just mean burly beast  of burden let's get back to mayor menino more uh audio of mayor menino in the state of the city  oh no we're gonna play that english english clip again we train 2200 more teachers to teach english

[02:21:30]  one i also said last year we can turn our south boston waterfront to a job create innovation  district what stops increasingly call the innovation district home i said that our waterfront should  not turn into anywhere usa instead through creative and some instance insistence it's becoming a model  that's a tough one country how to rebuild the economy around new and growing industries  he's he's the holy fuck he's been the mayor he's been the mayor forever he says ours like an indian 
[02:22:00]  person  glowing  he's a buffoon he really is a fucking boob  all right we'll move on with uh oh this one's terrific too they're all good in boston this year  we continue to see unending displays of hard work and common acts of devotion as just one example 
[02:22:30]  the earthquake struck haiti one year ago tomorrow boston rallied around our haitian friends  to help them recover and we stand with them still  another earthquake  we've made great strides amidst deep challenges all right so what did he do so what happened there  he's flailing his arms against him and he smacked the mic he knocks over his mic it has to go pick  it up it's haitian friends really he knocked it right over it's amazing this is the mayor of a 
[02:23:00]  fucking huge city by the way they were talking about how billions were given to the haitians and a year  later uh much has been done less than five percent of the rubble has been removed yeah and most of the  the population is still living in tents and no one has any accountability of where this is a shitty  country there's no government that does anything it's fucking ridiculous and all the do-gooders have  moved on to the next thing well because again they don't want us there we go in there and they  accuse us of occupying it's like you can't fucking win scumbags like chavez uh say that the  u.s is occupying haiti that fuck yeah have fun rebuild your own fucking country then give a

[02:26:00]  right maybe it goes backwards backwards yeah there it is it's seat 27 i'd hate to be in seat one way  back there oh the scum oh enough i like the fact that uh during a crash that front capsule pops off  and glides slowly down as the rest plummets in flames oh it's fantastic is a parachute on the 
[02:26:30]  in the front of the plane yes we all know about that piece all right let's let's get back to mayor  menino state of the city last night wonderful brand new fuck-ups from this asshole across so many  fronts the state of our city is exceptionally strong and resilient however oh there remains exceptions to  that great strength and some of us experience more opportunity and more prosperity 
[02:27:00]  summer as many of us look forward with great hope summer city wonder where to find it summer  asses are you allowed to just create words he's making this up all i know is i want some of those uh  prosperi's summer summer summer assie  what did he was he saying when he said somewhere let's go back is it actually summon our city i guess 
[02:27:30]  summer ass city you're like the interpreter i try yeah yeah that wow one door more hardship  as many of us look forward with great hope summer ass city wonder where to find it summer  ass city summer city this is like the king's speech but only with a retard  i bet you he doesn't go see that movie no i don't get this movie it's not funny at all he speaks 
[02:28:00]  perfectly well yeah wow he sounds like a charm he speaks like a charm almost done with the clips uh  one more from menino here so we move out of this recession job one making sure that bostonians who  still don't have work can find it jobs are the greatest equalizer jobs are the path to family success  an opportunity the jobs or the pop the pop that's not even the boston accent no no no that is just 
[02:28:30]  jobs or the pop that guy's a dolt you want a bonus clip please yeah but also make sure educational  opportunities is shared across the city we'll continue to require aggressive educational reform efforts  turning around underperforming schools is the best way to provide great schools every neighborhoods  great schools every neighborhoods he just leaves out words whenever he just leaves them in he  can pluralize his words that don't need him this guy has been a dummy for years they keep electing him 
[02:29:00]  i got dan dan what's up hey have you noticed menino's voice sounds like frosty the snowman from the  old rank and bass kids cartoon really i gotta go back and the man and the man's got one  i hate anyone called dan the man and then we got the here's the post address i think this might  be the news now so mayor with everything you've been through physically this is your last term right 
[02:29:30]  of course not i gotta tell you earlier 10 more years 10 more years okay that would mean menino  would be bowing out in 2021 after his seventh four-year term a mind-boggling tenure if he's  serious and who's to say he isn't many bostonians have never known another mayor and it may be many  more years before they get that chance who the fuck is this snidely guy talking what a horrible  man they're just a they're fucking horrible reporters and how is that possible in this 
[02:30:00]  country to be a mayor for 28 years always kind of a role model is that for kids i know just you don't  have to be mayor no i want to speak correctly yeah you don't have to to be the mayor of boston english  they'll keep electing you you um i gotta give amy the uh the hall of fame uh clips which ones are

[02:32:30]  he needed a lot so this guy literally hasn't even like acknowledged that i have an asshole which  is great because he needs the extra maintenance you know wow no it's been great he's like very  conservative like if i send him a naughty photo he'll write like thanks like i sent him a fax  you know like i gave him directions it's just been very thank you received yes exactly  just confirming yeah and i think confirmation number right totally so cold but uh it doesn't  stop me from sending them it's more for me well why not but uh so then the other night he we're at

[02:42:00]  that than not many comics can pull off the nude uh shoot like that that's pretty impressive yeah yeah  he's pretty sexy how do you feel about like because amy dresses nicely on stage and like i  saw you the first time i ever saw amy dressed up was on the comedy central special yeah and so  there's a woman they have that extra thing where it's like you don't want guys wanting to  fuck you while you're performing because your women have an extra thing  scrotum and i don't know why that's a good one daddy i wore like a a short skirt on the the comedy 
[02:42:30]  central set because i thought you know people are like oh a female comic's on flip you know nobody  wants to see that but in a smart pants right but maybe but maybe like they would stay an extra  second and then stay for the comedy if they see some games that's pretty smart like yeah you used  to be able to choose your background and i literally i would have chosen just like a pair of  tits so people wouldn't stop flipping you know as long as they stop i i think i'm like i like my  stand up i'm i'm working hard at it so if people like want to look at my legs and then they hang 
[02:43:00]  out great just to hang out to hear whatever it takes for them to hear you yeah amy's hilarious  yeah very funny last time i saw her was with uh joe de rosa down in philly they they  fucking killed thank you is sexy too i saw his nude thing in cosmo extremely sexy yeah if you get past  the fact he has no shoulders but yeah zero shoulders he did a he did a spread in a slope  shoulder to gypsum monthly but joe always puts you in a good mood because like he has the body  and the demeanor of somebody who's in a wheelchair so every time he stands up you're like oh my god 
[02:43:30]  look it's a miracle you're like why isn't there a blanket over his lap he's got an old person muscular  dystrophy body yeah he's only he's gotta be only 30 something right yeah and he's gotta he looks like  an old man he's fucking i tried to give him a shoulder massage it just didn't work  you feel like you're tickling his ribs there's just no shoulder on it as we're sliding on the  floor singing rags to riches to shirley feeney fucking dumb big carmine ragu fucking head oh wow

[02:45:30]  coming back it's making a comeback yeah i think a lot of the guys you're telling amy younger guys  you know all right well i don't know like younger guys are i think going for a little bit more hair  than just the clean shave thing really the clean shave thing is kind of becoming like and not for  jimmy i know jimmy loves the clean shave thing that's why he likes children he prefers children hey  it's not true but you prefer a little bit of hair um i just like to mix it up a little bit i think uh  i think a little bit natural i always say this and people think oh you like the 70s earth mama 
[02:46:00]  muff it's like no natural shape that triangle shape just a little grown in oh kind of nice  trimmed not trimmed right kind of like the mustache anthony's uh sporting yeah no no is it like that  i don't know it's just the whole completely shaved thing it's kind of  i think it's run its course it's kind of like you know it's not it's no it's not a fashion statement

[03:03:00]  there's been comedians who gave me a lot of flack for sticking up for maher sticking up for what his  comedy just him in general because but again i've heard a lot of bad things about bill my experiences  with him have been good um and i don't know examples of what he's done that were so awful other  than the fact that people say that he's been snotty or shitty like you guys had a bad experience  with him he's a really douche bag my times with him have been my experiences have been pleasant and  i do think he's a funny comic the only problem i have with a comedian i never care what their 
[03:03:30]  politics are like i don't care if they're liberal as long as they're being funny while they say it  or trying to be it's when comics like on stage get preachy that's where it bothers me you know here's  the problem i have with bill fuck cunt mar that's not his name it's not his name oh no it is to me  is that on his birth certificate he'll fight wouldn't it be great if it was i heard he's a huge  cock does he yeah i've heard that he's talking out with a huge he is a huge cock fuck him 
[03:04:00]  fuck him here's what it is he talks and and just like a liberal he won't fucking listen to anything  anyone has to say and you think the conservatives really listen though i don't know they they seem  to like on on the conservative shows they do seem to have more liberals on to talk about their  side of it the liberals will never have a real conservative it's very rare you see that because  they just want to preach their bullshit with this holier than thou attitude and that's what bill 
[03:04:30]  maher does bill maher won't say this is my opinion like i'm i'm pretty adamant and passionate about what  i say but i say this is my opinion bill maher says it like this is the truth and the only way things  are fuck you i'm going back pop his dick back and forth on twitter with a guy not negatively but  he's he's like he doesn't like the fact that uh that i was saying that liberals censor things he's  like well give me some example but it's like if you want to play a game of semantics you can  we all know that like we're not like when you go to do colleges if you're doing uh certain racial 
[03:05:00]  material they'll ask you not to do it uh there's there's been colleges that wanted you to sign stuff and  when you start to see standards and practices at the networks the things they want you to stay off  of because they're all young college a lot of young colleges are race domestic violence just these  things everybody cares about not the conservatives want to yell nigger and beat women i don't mean  that right but the things that are typically associated with that man we all know that yeah 
[03:05:30]  it's like and people play semantics games what do you mean but and don't act like people it like  when there's a conservative president making a speech the democrats will sit and the republicans  will stand and clap and then when bill clinton makes a speech like you know a state of the union  all the republicans sit and the democrats yeah so don't act like you don't understand  come on you do know the conservatives were the ones who fucking made the tenfold radio fines  conservatives are the ones that were sexually uptight and made a big deal about janet jackson 
[03:06:00]  that was all conservative ideology and mentality race uh things of that nature those are fucking  uh liberal yeah the liberals just don't act like you don't know it don't play that semantics game  you know we all sorry i'm babbling i'm a little tired i apologize no it's not at all do you want  this audio yeah let me hear let me hear this your take on this tragedy in in arizona this this gunman  shooting i mean you always have an interesting perspective on these things well i mean first of all  you know we're gonna have to hear from the nra a lot about how this shouldn't stop anything that 
[03:06:30]  they want to do first of all the nra should just change their name to the assassin's lobby  because that's what they are you yeah you're gonna fuck your mother in our  fucking asshole that was kind of funny though  fuck you the assassin's lobby really the fucking only the only organization in this country that's  protecting your second amendment freedom that is keeping the second amendment from being wiped off  the fucking constitution by cocksuckers like you is the nra yeah they got their faults abso-fucking-lutely 
[03:07:00]  but they're doing uh the only a job of defending the second amendment against people that just want to  swipe it right away from you fuck you bill maher i'm sure whenever anyone comes up to bill maher and  wants to give him shit there's some big motherfucker with a gun to keep any uh people away from him go  fuck yourself and your mother what are you a fucking expert fuck you bill maher bill maher  because that's what they are yeah you can applaud that somebody should applaud that oh really i'm 
[03:07:30]  i'm so tired of hearing about the second amendment and the constitution if you love guns just admit  it like a it's a vice it's like alcohol or drugs or sex addiction or gambling it's just a vice it's  something you like it's not good for you or anybody else you just like it but stop the bull about the  second amendment in the constitution because nobody needs stop nobody needs a gun that fires 31 rounds 
[03:08:00]  how about it's fun that's what this guy had about the interesting thing sarah palin needed five to  shoot that moose that was basically on the end of the couch  fuck him he's talking about a constitutional right go fuck yourself he's such an asshole how about i  talk like that about the first amendment and you shut your fucking mouth how about i go hey no one  needs that first amendment you know the one where bill maher can go on jay leno and mouth off about  other amendments go fuck yourself that cunt is a douchebag and i fucking hate him and he's got no 
[03:08:30]  concept of what freedoms in this country are he gets on his dumb fuck show and talks shit like that  all the time and then he gets on leno and infects that show with his drivel  fuck you bill maher you're a cunt you're a cunt bill maher that was only the first him that's only  the first clip ah yeah yeah but it's like this is a much big just like lump halen and it's like  oh he's got to do the same line lump halen in talking about you know what you know what you're 
[03:09:00]  absolutely right a pistol people say and hit people like him your pistol we don't need that  many rounds and a clip we don't need pistols because they're just made to kill people we  don't need this type of gun or that type of gun uh if it's for hunting it's that no it's it doesn't  say you have the right to hunt it says you have the right to bear fucking arms and and the thing is  uh how about a car that uh uh everybody should just drive a prius around no oh what do you want you  want a nice old gto that does fucking 160 miles an hour uh why you don't need that you know why 
[03:09:30]  you have it because it's fun it's sexy it's exciting it's it's it's something it's an activity it's  something you do enjoy guns shooting at the range i do enjoy that he's right it's fun is it a vice like  drugs fuck you fuck you how many guns you have a lot a lot of fucking guns you know why i like  shooting different types of guns sometimes i like seeing what i could do with a nine millimeter 
[03:10:00]  sometimes i like backing the target way the fuck up and seeing what i could do with a 50. sometimes i  like taking out an ar-15 and seeing what i could do at mid-range the the fs fucking 2000 see what i  can do close up different types of scopes but this idiot the people that criticize guns the most are  people that have never fucking touched them they're either a scared shitless of them of even  touching them or they just don't know anything about them do you think bill maher's ever 
[03:10:30]  fucking fired a gun no that liberal cunt knows nothing about him the thing is people hate people  tend to be very like what bothers me is the rights that people are willing to give up are the things  that don't kind of go hand in hand with their own ideology that's what drives me nuts that bill  maher's a liberal guy so right so to him amendment two is kind of not that important and whoever it  needs it is just a gun nut right right but again if you were to take away like you said his right to 
[03:11:00]  say something right people are just very selective in what they defend and condemn and it's like you  either agree if you don't mean that's what drives me fucking crazy people don't realize the way the  amendments were written number one is speech number two is fucking right to bear arms which directly  protects number one you dumb fuck it is there and written that way on purpose number one is freedom  of speech and expression number two is the right to bear arms so you can protect the first one you 
[03:11:30]  asshole anthony uh car chase on twitter very confused so you're a fan of bill maher he's he's he's not sure  oh he's not sure yeah he's not sure yeah guy's hysterical oh good okay here's the second clip  from leto there's a much bigger issue which is the psychology of this country which loves guns  it's just a very armed country with a lot of crazy people which is not a lot of crazy people hold on  hold on hold on hold on hold on here's what this fucking idiot is talking about it's it is a very armed 
[03:12:00]  country and it's meant to be the whole basis of the second amendment is also to keep the government  in check that's what it was supposed to be we're an armed populace and there's a reason for that are  we going to go up against the american military no it's not like that it wasn't it but the whole  gist of the second amendment is to have an armed populace for uh a lot of different things and and it  keeps the government and the powers that be in check and it still does it absolutely does we are an 
[03:12:30]  armed thing but for him to say that it's crazy a bunch of gun nuts no there are gun nuts and there  are crazy people that own guns but the majority of law-abiding gun owners are not nuts they're people  that are exercising a fucking right that you have in this country the only thing the only thing i have  a problem with is if any i'm not saying that any place where they don't want you to have to take  a test a man i think you should have to show this guy did pass it and that's going to happen 
[03:13:00]  but i think that you should have to show mental stability and i think background check all that  stuff now now if this guy was unstable and fucking had psycho problems every time you fill out an  application it asks it on the application it says do you have or have you been treated for mental  illnesses no one will admit that but exactly but the second you don't admit it you're falsifying 
[03:13:30]  your application but don't forget just because you which is illegal which makes the gun that you then  got an illegal weapon well the stop check has to be that there's a way to check because like getting  onto a plane if you don't have your id they don't say well are you an american citizen are you jim  norton and i go yes and they let me on i have to prove it by showing an id and to purchase a gun i think  that we have the right as other citizens to go you sure you can have one but you have to prove to us  somehow that you're mentally qualified how would they go about proving mental mental records to get 
[03:14:00]  a gun you are like there are mental health records they do they do fbi and criminal background does that  stuff come up oh it'll it'll come up if you've had a a legal run-in because of your mental problems  how about if you but how about the person that gets on a plane and then in the middle of the  flight tries to open the fucking door of course that's a lunatic absolutely should we now mentally  screen everyone that's getting on planes how about people driving cars that decide they're committing 
[03:14:30]  suicide and uh park on train tracks or run into a crowd of fucking people they're mentally damaged  everybody that get a driver's license should they now have to uh get a mental fucking background  check no but i do and i why then with a gun because i think guns are different and i agree with the  gun analogy with cars like as far as them being banned but i think that we have the right as  citizens like as a citizen i want you to be able to own a gun because i trust you i want kenny and 
[03:15:00]  other people because i think you're competent citizens and i want you to be able to conceal carry  but i also want to know that anyone that they're giving that permit or that that ability to because  i know it's a god-given right but again the old joke about it's not muskets anymore yeah there is  there is the constitution has to be looked at in in in a the mindset of the people that that authored  it and also where we are right now i want people who have gone to conceal to carry to have some kind  of a a mental stability and i think that if you can get that you should be able to it would be very 
[03:15:30]  difficult to screen for that i don't know how you'd go about it if there was make the medical records  open not an additional test if there's a way i would love to but people people also have a right to  privacy as to their medical records what medical records now would have to be mental health mental  i don't care if you have aids i don't care mental health records people do have the right to privacy  but to somebody's right to privacy um override my right to safety by them getting a gun when they're 
[03:16:00]  mentally not qualified now here you go about the first amendment and freedom of speech um what if  somebody has the ability to say something inflammatory that will uh incite other people  to do harmful things should now we have to have mental competency to give somebody the right to get  up in front of a crowd and speak to a crowd of people in public because they might be mentally unstable 
[03:16:30]  and influence other people no because first of all it's this the exerciser of the right the person  speaking their mental capacity isn't going to affect what other people do and also but there  are also been the argument with this whole thing there is also influencing other people time place you  can't yell fire in a movie theater right cannot incite people to riot so those things are already in  place like you know i mean like you can't do that i'm not talking about that i'm not talking about  inciting a riot right i'm talking about influencing people through speech like like hitler right 
[03:17:00]  hitler was great at getting up and influencing people with his speaking now should he have been  in in this day and age screened for his mental health before he's able to get up in front of a  crowd no and influence people to hate and kill and and and perform genocide uh in order to exercise  his right his first amendment right if he was in our country so then why is the second amendment falling 
[03:17:30]  under this blanket of we need to make sure this person is mentally competent now i understand this  and i agree with you don't get me right but i want to know how it's done well i would say and again all  the you shouldn't have to prove uh mental stability no background record of mental okay then i'm not  saying that the people aren't going to fall through the cracks and that's what happens it's going to  happen but i'm saying that every right does not have to have that i think the only one that matters is  guns as far as you look you should have to in this day and age if they can do a mental background 
[03:18:00]  check if nothing comes up and you're crazy anyway well that happens because like you say people get  on planes and do crazy but if you display some sort of mental illness they won't let you on a plane  so if you if you're standing there acting odd and i mean aggressive you're not getting on that plane  so there are ways to i think check people for mental stability and if you know what if nothing comes  up in the records nothing comes up in the records that's gonna happen now this guy he everyone knew 
[03:18:30]  he was crazy right a lot of people knew he was crazy but technically he hadn't gone for treatment  so no one had any right concrete evidence that he was crazy so he couldn't be denied uh  purchasing a firearm it's also like with free speech here's an example believe me i'm not saying  it's good that this guy got a gun believe me it would have been better he hadn't gotten the gun  westboro church wants to protest in front of these funerals right and that's a big free speech 
[03:19:00]  issue yeah where's the line what is appropriate they're crazy they are but they arizona enacted  some emergency legislation so that they could not disrupt this nine-year-old girls right and i agree  with it as much and i'm for free speech no matter what you want to say but i think that if we can't  common sense understand what those people are doing when they're yelling god loves dead fags in front of an  if if anyone thinks the mindset of the authors of the constitution was to allow people to taunt the 
[03:19:30]  family of a murdered nine-year-old that i think that you're just playing a game of semantics i think  everybody knows that nobody who made that constitution if everybody wants to harp on the founding fathers  and how great they were nobody who wrote up that constitution did so with the intent so that  right animals who wanted to taunt a dead girl's family would be permitted to stand right there  and do it anything else or very few limits i think that would have been one of the limitations even 
[03:20:00]  though it's not inciting people to riot they just didn't see that when they wrote it like they didn't  see machine guns when they wrote up the constitution they couldn't foresee everything i understand and  you you can't get a machine gun it takes all kinds of special licensing yeah you got to jump  through a lot of hoops to be able to own a machine gun in this country yeah it's just it's it it doesn't  happen the thing is and getting back to bill maher the way he's talking right uh calling the nra uh  uh you know an assassin group it's silly is ridiculous and and talking about the second amendment like 
[03:20:30]  it's some kind of crime and it's not an accurate and only lunatics are exercising their second right  amendment a second amendment rights that's bill maher and that's fucking infuriating and inflammatory  and and bullshit so we shouldn't play any more of these clips then i'd love to hear one oh no i  want to i want to hear one more you're losing your voice though you're right uh i know i'm yelling  all right i'm hanging in there i i want to hear what this congratulations on the machine gun by the  way idiot has i forgot to send you a uh a congratulatory card for that it's fucking great hallmark's got 
[03:21:00]  wonderful cards when it comes to your friends buying machine guns i would love to own a machine gun  but i can't i know i can't and i you know i make do with my semi-automatics and and somebody also  should tell all these people these nra types who think it's great to be armed everywhere arizona  has one of the loosest gun rules in the country you can i think carry any weapon concealed without a  permit they want every drunk in a bar to be armed in case a fight breaks out right 
[03:21:30]  and these guys always think that you know it's great to have a gun because if some  bad stuff goes down i'll be able to stop the bad guy this is your fantasy ass you would never be able  to do that now people have to be trained for months and months at a time exactly they have to really  know what's going on to be able to stop something can you can you stop that for a second uh anybody  right now listening to bill cunt mar go to uh armed citizen go to the armed citizen uh website it's 
[03:22:00]  it's an nra website it's just an entire fucking website dedicated to stories of people thwarting  crime with legal uh weapons with legal uh guns and and there are so many stories i can't even  fucking tell you thousands of stories of people that have stopped crimes in progress rapes robberies 
[03:22:30]  murders home invasions it's cut it's there's thousands of stories but you don't see them in  in the news right never in the in the in the bill fucking marr cunt liberal news you really don't  they'll never show them so it's not about fucking action movie hero pulling a gun out uh after he's  carrying it for a week and saving the day from a fantasy bill marr fuck you it's about uh protect  a protection exercising a second amendment right which you have which i don't have to explain why 
[03:23:00]  i'm exercising my fucking right i don't have to explain it to you you're right that's that's where  it is and that's where it stands and yes a lot of crime has been thwarted by legal gun owners but do  you know that like if like let's say you were dragged and down to uh jail and they didn't read  you your rights you would be screaming what about my rights like right nobody would go on leno or any  show and say you know these idiots that want uh their rights read to them you you wouldn't say that 
[03:23:30]  oh these idiots that want the miranda right uh miranda uh warning oh jesus what an idiot they're  all just criminals who have something to hide like you wouldn't say idiots that want the right to vote  oh what a dummy what a bunch of shitheads fuck you bill cunt stop something like that if that really  happened they would probably freeze up and shoot the wrong person right so so let's stop that fantasy  also okay uh and also i think how about the democrats reclaiming this issue this is the 
[03:24:00]  problem i understand that the gun lobby owns the supreme court and they own the republican party  what's disappointing is that they have cowed the democratic party into silence it's the right  should be one party that sticks up for this issue not expecting it from this crowd but some audience  somewhere should not get the big applause busy see that's where that's not getting the big applause  are you bill maher that's where to me as a comic it's like again i know we all and on the radio 
[03:24:30]  is different because we have four hours to do yeah but like when you're you know it's like yeah  you kind of got to be funny with your opinions or try to be yeah well no the motherfucker is actually  sitting there preaching that the democratic party should take a hold at eliminating our second  amendment right is is that what you're saying bill maher because because uh uh no one could be a hero  and pull a gun out and and stop a crime or it whatever he's a he's a a fucking out of touch  shithead the right wing loves the the go-to rhetoric for them is wouldn't it be fun to kill the people 
[03:25:00]  we disagree with what you know they try to put what this false equivalent i shoot paper i shoot paper  targets because it's fun really then do you read did you have you have you seen what people have  said yes have you seen what sarah pan says you know she talks about yeah don't retreat reload  pause that real quick please again and the bill's a smart guy he knows better that is 
[03:25:30]  like you said those are metaphors that's not real nobody who says don't retreat reload meant  take your guns and aim them at politicians nobody thinks that for real it's like you can't say that  honestly you can't think because again they like like i hate to tell people but when you when you're  watching tv and the at&t map is in that commercial those guys really don't watch football with an at&t  map in front of them it's kind of a metaphor for the coverage of the country you know yes nobody 
[03:26:00]  thinks that and it's like all of a sudden they're playing these i hate to say keep saying these  samantha's games like where they're taking things literally that they know are not meant to be taken  literally but they're doing it selectively because again nobody says look football is violent you cannot  encourage in a physical sport men to kill other men and people are saying i want the jets  yeah to kill the cult we don't need that type of talk it's nonsense yeah they're going to kill 
[03:26:30]  them why didn't they blame football rhetoric on oj oj murdered his wife how come they didn't blame very  tough uh you know what they got to do here is get in this zone and and they're going to blow past these  guys and they got to destroy kill them it's selective man comedians use brutal lingo we talk like that  i how'd you do oh i shit the bed i died i killed i murdered how did he do all he said he fucking 
[03:27:00]  bombed how come nobody ever blames suicide bombings on comics using terminology you cannot be selective  if you're going to be self-righteous about semantics yeah you know better well apparently bill maher doesn't  anybody saying that knows better and you know what here i am yelling about it not being funny but i'm not  blaming behavior on people's rhetoric i'm not blaming liberals because people go out and do  shit i don't blame left-wing people or noam chomsky and these people because people do 
[03:27:30]  shit i don't blame anybody except the scumbag who did it yeah the scumbag not who did it and bill maher  is is portraying people that exercise their second amendment right as nuts that's what he's doing  right here in his dumb speech is it like a pull toy that's broken every five minutes  she says this uh michelle bachman said she wants minnesotans armed and dangerous alan west a new  congressman said he wants his opponent to be afraid to leave the house left-wingers don't talk that way 
[03:28:00]  uh and also you say that wingers even if they do sometimes make a gun analogy or something  their audience isn't hysterical they're already talking right there please open the people who are  hysterical and are irrational and are highly armed to begin with right there is in the justification  of why if we say it it's okay right and if you say it it's not what well our audiences don't behave  that way that really is and again i like bill but that's complete intellectual snobbery and elitism 
[03:28:30]  pompous come on billy oh we're better than that look when we say it we know and our audience isn't  crazy but when uh a conservative or the nra or gun owners uh hear it or say it they're nuts really  bill really this this kind of this corny belief that you're smarter than conservatives yeah or that  all conservatives are just a bunch of dummies it's like enough already it's old and it's not accurate 
[03:29:00]  and and the the hard right and the hard left are both fucking dummies they're all twice and he is  way on the hard left and i fucking cannot stand listening to him he's an embarrassment he's an  embarrassment let's let's stop there it's getting a little one more one more clip oh come on newt  gingrich and by the way among the right-wing douchebags i hate i hate him the mostest  uh oh wow what year is this yeah what has newt done in he says things he said the obama administration 
[03:29:30]  is as much a threat to us as were the nazis and the soviet union all right yeah now it's not just  ridiculous but when you when you characterize the opposition the political opposition is not just  the opposition but the enemy like when they call so much a nazi like when they were always calling  bush hitler and a nazi hitler mustache on signs as they protested him everywhere he went is that 
[03:30:00]  what you're talking about and that's a fair point call bush hitler i don't care who cares but then  don't cry and be victimized when somebody says it about your guy right fuck this who are enemies  of course you're going to have borderline people who go and take this over the line too bad so so  stop telling me that the left and the right are both crazy yes there are crazies on the left yeah but  they're not the same they're not gun crazy right they're smarter crazy who goes to gun shows 
[03:30:30]  who was for the war in iraq who's part of militias yeah you know when you hear that when you hear the  phrase armed compound in a secluded rural area what is that a bunch of democrats is that dennis  kucinich out there i don't think so sorry you asked no i'm not sorry no i'm not sorry  fuck you think lana was uncomfortable no i mean he probably knew what bill was going to say  he knew he was going to go in that direction obviously a fucking bill maher what an asshole 
[03:31:00]  what a fucking asshole just give up give give up more of your rights yeah but how about but the  how about the crime that's committed with guns are you telling me like all the shootings in brownsville  and east new york and east l.a by those gangs you're going to tell me that's all republicans  those gangs are all republicans all conservatives right crazy yeah he's right about the militias  those are not democrat the majority of them are probably not democrats and he's right a lot of them  are not but again a lot of these guys in these gangs you're going to tell me that they're filled 
[03:31:30]  with republicans don't be victimized when it goes both ways intellectual elitism is boring and  and militias aren't shooting each other up to get uh their more territory and turf uh gangs who uh  for the most part are um uh uh minorities and uh do not look at themselves as republicans or  conservatives uh are killing each other left and right with with illegal weapons and how about the 
[03:32:00]  way janet reno handled uh where was it in texas with david koresh by the way i agree with a great one  i i agreed with her that's how you handle that but fucking wipe those crazies out i mean that's  a shitty way to put it but a lot of people came down on how could she do that and she was uh she  was not a republican yeah that was that was great fucking bill maher what a what a zero what a  fucking zilch i have never ever listened to one word from him and and agreed or or even thought he was 
[03:32:30]  speaking intellectually in any way shape or form it's just people who you know are going to have  certain opinions have them yeah and you know you know there's never a balance or a curveball no  surprise ever all right let's get the plugs in i have this sunday and saturday the borgata i don't  even know the late show might be sold out i'm not sure where they might have released some casino  comps whatever it is there's under 100 tickets left for the late show the other two are completely

[03:33:30]  welcome back everybody to adventures in docking now as we all know docking is when two gay men uh  have their penises erect and one man takes the foreskin of his penis and stretches it over the  head of the other man's penis so let's go to the phones let's see we have sam here from new york  um let's see now sam uh when did this docking fetish begin for you well i was in college as a freshman 
[03:34:00]  in college so i came home for spring break uh-huh and it should i scheduled it to do it on the first  day wow the very first day huh you sure are eager to try new things yeah so like what made you even want  to get into docking in the first place for whatever reason i wasn't circumcised obviously when i was  born okay so i see what you're saying basically you figured hey i have this extra skin on my penis  i might as well use it to my sexual advantage yes uh now sam would you say that your penis is big 
[03:34:30]  enough for proper docking like i don't know six inches uh i mean i don't know if i'm quite there  it's average it's fine now it says here that you once tried to dock with a very large black gentleman and  it didn't quite work out tell me about that the hole in the foreskin it wasn't big enough to stretch  over over his giant cock head gotcha so it wasn't getting stuck to the head right it's not stuck to  the head it's just the hole is too small to fit over the head that is so embarrassing what did you  do about it going forward i don't want to have to have an explanation and so we went to the urologist 
[03:35:00]  to get uh you know a word on it right so you wanted to get your foreskin stretched out so you could  dock with bigger men urologist said you know it happens it's not typical if you want to change  it for aesthetics or for whatever reason it's a simple procedure and you come in and you do it  and you're out well that's great now you can dock with anybody yeah that's correct well sam thanks for  the call uh this is all the time we have uh for adventures in docking this week join us next week  where we'll be discussing proper docking techniques at a pumping party see you then </pre>
