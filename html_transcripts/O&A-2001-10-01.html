<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic, offensive song about Osama bin Laden, setting the tone for the rest of the show.  Guest Jim Norton ("Jimmy Rickles") was in studio. The hosts then recounted their weekend at the Comedy Central Friar's Roast of Hugh Hefner, detailing offensive and crude observations about the performances of Adam Ferrara, Jeffrey Ross, Rob Schneider, Dick Gregory, Gilbert Gottfried, and Ice-T.  Anthony also gossiped about interactions with Jackie Martling, Adam Carolla, Steve Carell, and Nancy Walls, using offensive and gossipy language to describe their behavior.  His particularly strong negative reaction to Patricia Hearst's presence was a major topic.

The show shifted to a discussion of their former boss, Gary Wall, and excerpts from a book about WNEW radio, which mentioned their time there.  They criticized Wall's management style, his firing of long-time employees, and the subsequent chaos at the station, using derogatory and offensive terms.  They also criticized other radio stations' promotional gimmicks like "Rocktober" and "Top Nine at Nine," contrasting them with their own mishaps, including the "world's largest Pop-Tart" promotion orchestrated by "Pop-Tart Roger," poorly designed "WOW" window clings, pilfered station memorabilia, and a disastrous Super Bowl promotion.  The "Free Beer Thursday" initiative's failure was also discussed.  The segment included mentions of several people including Colleen (caller), Vic, Snorton Norton, Brother Louise, Scott Herman, Andrea, Matt Devote, Don (caller), Scott Muni, and other WNEW-FM employees.  An on-air fight with a colleague, a broken foosball table, their opinions on SNL, and Jay Moore's appearance on "The Weakest Link" were also mentioned.

The next segment focused on reality TV shows like "Weakest Link" and "Big Brother 2,"  movie censorship post-9/11 (specifically the removal of the Twin Towers from films), and numerous callers.  In-studio guest Bill discussed Jay Moore's appearance on "Weakest Link," including a humorous anecdote about a contestant voting him off due to a past romantic rejection and her subsequent engagement to George Stephanopoulos.  Frank Caliendo called in, discussing his appearances on Mad TV. Greg called about Jay Moore inadvertently revealing his address. Al disputed a caller about "Don't Say a Word" omitting the World Trade Center. Peter talked about a plane flying over a Giants game.  Opie revealed his New Hampshire trip (initially misconstrued as leaf-peeping) involving wolves and horseback riding.  He introduced his new radio contest idea: the "Naughty Nighty Contest," prompting discussion about its logistics and potential pitfalls.  The segment also included insults directed at Julie Kahn, their old station manager, and a mention of a planned audio segment featuring a past argument with Carol Miller.


The final segment played audio clips documenting a heated confrontation between Opie and Anthony and Carol Miller.  The conflict stemmed from their disruptive style clashing with Miller's traditional approach.  The clips revealed arguments sparked by Opie and Anthony playing a kazoo over classic rock songs during a station special.  Miller defended the classic rock format and criticized their behavior, leading to escalating arguments including the hosts urging her resignation and offering her the station's CD collection.  Miller responded with retorts and, notably, presented the hosts with enemas. The argument included barbs about the showâ€™s low ratings and Miller's past success. The segment concluded before all clips played, promising continuation the next day and mentioning a future guest appearance by Voss and Norris.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opin' Anthony show.  Hey, Mr. Ben Laden, listen to me.  You're messing with the land of the brave and the home of the free.  It's a show tune. 
[00:00:30]  It's a show tune.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  We just did it.  In the military, you might get shot by a great big fairy.  So poor little Osama, you should have listened to your mama and not been such a big bully.  We're gonna kick your butt in.  Hello to your turban.  Our bombs are gonna do you in.  It's just about time for you to pay.  Watch out for the big bad USA. 
[00:01:00]  You're a girl.  That was the best song we heard today.  Wow, there you go.  I'll say it.  You know something?  Thank you.  I bet it's even better.  That's a winner.  I bet it's even better with the dance number.  How did you know?  I was dancing all over the room as I was singing it.  Oh, God.  Top hats, canes.  Yeah, the roaring 20s.  I can see it now.  Like a Busby Berkeley musical. 
[00:01:30]  The homo faggot queer.  Howdy, faggot.  U.S. officials continue to search for Osama bin Laden.  Reports suggest that bin Laden is most likely hiding out somewhere remote and barren where he will not encounter others.  The FBI has begun searching theaters showing the movie Glitter.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Hey.  What's up, Anthony?  What's up, Jimmy?  What's up?  Let's start calling him Jimmy.  Why?  Jim Norton?  Jimmy Rickles.  Jimmy Rickles. 
[00:02:30]  Jimmy Rickles in the studio.  I got emails about that.  Did you?  Yeah, I didn't know he was your father.  Do you have to be that stupid?  Yeah.  There's going to be a picture up of you and your father on FoundryMusic.com in the very near future.  Oh, good.  Somebody already put one up, one of the listeners.  The picture of me as a baby.  That's very funny.  All right.  A couple phone numbers to give you all.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, please give us a call.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:03:00]  Where do we begin today?  Well, we had a busy little weekend.  Want to start with our weekend crap?  I was hobnobbing with the celebrities in town, Opie.  You know how I love doing this.  Yeah.  Hello again.  What is this? 
[00:03:30]  Which one's this?  I don't know.  I have no clue.  I'm just trying it out.  Okay, good.  Billy.  Billy Staples from the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah.  He used to be Fat Guy on the Opie and Anthony show, but now he's Billy Staples on the Ron and Fez show.  Radio is weird that way.  Whatever works.  If you move on to another show, you've got to change your name to something else.  Fat Guy from our old show.  I'm sure he likes Billy Staples better.  Is now Billy Staples on Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  He came running in with a Neil Diamond karaoke CD. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  To make your Neil Diamond impression complete, Anthony.  Well, I can't wait to jot down some lyrics.  So, which one's this?  I don't know.  That's what I was trying to figure out.  It's kind of hard to tell.  I'll have to study it.  Well, let's wait for the singing to kick it.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  It's karaoke.  Yeah.  It's karaoke.  I don't know.  All right.  Oh, here it is.  Here's the list.  Brother loves traveling.  Man, maybe Billy Staples could come up with some of the Neil Diamond ones that we'd actually play.  I think the hits are on there.  Cracklin' Rosie's on there. 
[00:04:30]  Cracklin' Rosie.  Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon.  Yeah, you did the original.  Hello again.  Kentucky Woman.  Love on the Rocks.  Ain't no big surprise.  September morning.  Pull me a drink and I'll leak in your eye.  And of course, this little bitty.  Which one's that?  If you can't tell this one, then.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, it doesn't want to queue up.  It's not queuing up. 
[00:05:00]  No.  You got to hit it sometimes.  Come on.  Just wrecking the whole flow of the show.  Yeah, well.  This stupid Neil Diamond karaoke thing.  It's not going to queue up.  Whose knob are you hobbing, Anthony?  No, I said I was hob-nobbing.  Not knob-hobbing.  You were hanging out.  That's different.  You were hanging out with celebrities.  Yeah.  You know how much I love that opiates.  Whenever I do it, I feel like the fish out of water.  Once I went to...  This is going back a couple of years ago now. 
[00:05:30]  I went to the details party.  Remember that?  And everybody's all gussied up.  And I showed up in my t-shirt, jeans, and leather jacket.  A leather jacket.  And you were way out of place.  I was like the Fonz.  I remember it well like it was yesterday.  And all these model type and GQ types walking around.  You know, the hair done all right and everything.  This is still when I had my hat and ponytail, too.  The hat and ponytail days?  Yeah.  So I'm there, you know, hanging out.  It's like, oh.  Where Tom Lickass was so obsessed with you that he did a whole show on ponytails. 
[00:06:00]  Let's do all show on ponytails.  Come on.  Call me.  Bob, you're calling from a cell phone.  You're on with Tom Lakin.  And what was he asking the people?  Tim Lickass.  What was he asking the people if they like or hate ponytails?  Do you like the ponytail?  Uh, Tom, I hate them.  All right, you hate them.  There's another guy that hates the ponytail.  And then the next caller.  Uh, Tom, I think the ponytail is cute.  Now, why would you like the ponytail?  I ought to come there and beat you.  I don't know.  Throw you in the fireplace. 
[00:06:30]  Come on.  I think it's kind of sexy.  It's better than having fake hair like you.  Fake hair, sunglasses in a dark studio,  and a members-only jacket.  Come on.  Tom, where did you get that Down syndrome wig?  I go to the Down syndrome haircut place.  Come on.  Tom Lakin.  Anyway, it was your ponytail days.  Yeah, so I was in there.  It just, I, I remember.  No one talked to you.  No one talked.  No one cared.  You were embarrassed to be there because you didn't fit in. 
[00:07:00]  I didn't fit in.  We don't try.  So I don't fit in.  We don't really try to fit in, but you really made sure he didn't fit in the details part.  So now, Saturday night, there's the roast.  The Comedy Central Fryer's Roast of Hugh Hefner.  Hugh Hefner is going to be on Comedy Central.  Yes.  In about a month.  Yeah, November.  Yeah.  And so I went to that.  And this, Opie, black tie event.  Black tie. 
[00:07:30]  Wait a minute.  Tuxes.  Wait a minute.  You rented a tux?  Of course.  R. Anthony rented a tux?  Got a tux?  When was the last time you were in a tux?  Let me think.  Let me think.  I can tell you the last time I was in a tux, and it was a complete waste of money and time.  When?  The grand opening of that stupid wax museum.  You went to that in a tux?  Well, it was a black tie.  It was a black tie, and they made it sound like it was a special.  I'm like, look, I don't get invited to anything.  I'm at the grand opening, but it says you've got to wear a tux, so I went and got a tux 
[00:08:00]  and stuff.  They invited everyone from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania.  Yeah, not so special.  No, no.  We were packed in there like sardines.  No one could even tell you had a black tux on.  Nothing special about it.  I don't even remember the last time I put a tux on.  Can't even remember.  It was some kind of wedding, I guess.  That's the only time, you know.  Well, that's a good answer.  Miserable wedding that's probably broken up by now.  Oh, yeah, it was mine. 
[00:08:30]  No, it wasn't, because I don't think you even wore a tux at your wedding.  No, I don't think I did either.  You were married in a basement somewhere.  Yeah, somewhere.  No, I didn't have the tails on the top out, Rick.  Yeah, a black tie event.  Went there.  It was at the Hilton Hotel in Manhattan in the Grand Ballroom.  Very, very hoity-toity.  And the celebrities are all walking around.  They're just all walking around.  That's what they're doing.  They're going about their business.  What do you think they do?  They just hang out in closets until they're called on? 
[00:09:00]  Well, they have the celebrities up there.  Look, I still got the program.  I bet you even some of the celebrities had to go to the bathroom, even.  Yes, some of them did get up and go to the bathroom.  Look at that.  Celebrities have to take a leak, too.  We had my pal, Adam Ferrara.  Oh, Brother Joe wants in.  And I think I just hung up on him.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  Well, the phone doesn't feel like it.  Morton.  Hey, Joe.  He called up to say the last time I was in a tux was on the cruise.  That's right.  They have, like, a formal night. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  Anyway, my pal, Adam Ferrara, was there.  And Jeffrey Ross, who I was invited, who invited me.  I sat at the guests of Jeffrey Ross table to a lot of his family.  A lot of his family was there, you know.  And he got up.  I got to tell you, he killed.  Are they all sarcastic like him, the whole family, the mom, the dad, the brothers, the sisters?  They all, they're all like, oh, please, Jeffrey's like just a regular kind of guy.  He comes over, he eats, he falls asleep on the couch.  It's like he's not funny or anything. 
[00:10:00]  What a great roaster he is, though.  He is, from, let me tell you, he got up from beginning to end.  First of all, Jimmy Kimmel was the roast master, and he did a great job.  Kept it moving, very good.  Jeffrey Ross gets a beginning to end of his whole time up there at the podium.  Hysterically funny.  He's just goofing on everybody that's sitting on the dais, people in the crowd.  Very funny.  Rob Schneider is there from Animal and Deuce Bigelow.  He gets up. 
[00:10:30]  He is so unfunny.  I'm sorry.  Later on, Deuce Bigelow fans, later on, Jeffrey will later tell me, you know, these people, they front load their act.  They front load it where, you know, it comes off starting good, but then they just have nothing left at the end.  And that's what happened.  Schneider, he had a couple of funny lines at the beginning.  He started real strong.  He started strong.  You know, he's goofing on half and playboy and the bimbos that were with him and everything.  See, even you and I know not to start strong. 
[00:11:00]  And look at our first hour of this radio show.  It always blows.  Right.  Exactly.  Stinks.  But by five, we are rocking.  By five, we are rolling.  We're rocking.  And then at six, we bring it right back down.  Okay?  You get a good hour in.  So he starts tanking.  It's called not knowing what we're going to talk about the first hour.  Who cares?  Go ahead.  So he's tanking.  Yeah.  You know?  And Jeffrey gets up to the podium.  It breaks into the middle of...  Now, was it so bad that, like, Jeffrey felt like, man, I better go save him? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Type of bad?  Rob Schneider.  Oh.  That bad.  So he gets up.  And in the middle of Rob Schneider talking, he just grabs the mic and goes,  hasn't there been enough bombing in New York?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That must have destroyed.  That killed?  Oh, yeah.  Killed.  That'll leave a brood.  Everyone was just dying.  And then Jimmy Kimmel gets up and says, next time, can we get the Schneider from one day  at a time?  Oh.  Come on.  Yeah.  Oh.  He just killed Rob Schneider then just sitting down. 
[00:12:00]  That might explain why at the after party, he was so drunk.  He was snotted.  He's walking down the stairs.  He's got these three really hot chicks with him.  He's walking down the stairs.  He turns and looks like he recognizes me and my girlfriend, like we're walking up the  stairs.  So he looks and he's like, hey, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, got to go this way, this way.  And he turns around and starts walking.  He's just hammered.  Now, he's with these hot chicks and stuff.  So he did really poorly. 
[00:12:30]  Then they had, who's that black guy with the beard?  And he makes people lose weight.  Dick Gregory.  Dick Gregory.  Sure.  Dick Gregory gets up.  He used to be funny, right?  Yeah.  Before he decided that he's going to be serious and a spokesperson for whatever.  Funny political comic years and years ago.  Yeah.  So he gets up and it was like a sermon, you know?  He's talking about American pride and how Americans pull together and this, that, or  the other thing.  And, you know, the people are buying it.  You know, he's doing it right because of the situation. 
[00:13:00]  People are, they're not too tired here.  Can I interrupt again?  Yeah.  Comedy Central filming the whole thing?  Yeah.  They only have, it's only going to be an hour on Comedy Central.  Oh, I know.  So basically Dick Gregory's.  Oh, you won't see much of him.  Okay.  No, no.  So he gives this big sermon though.  And at the end, his voice is raising up.  He's like a preacher or something, you know?  And we will overcome this problem.  Like, oh, okay, okay.  So he gets done.  Everyone's like standing up, applauding.  He sits down.  Jimmy Kimmel gets back up at the mic and goes, he goes, all right, well, anyway, so I had 
[00:13:30]  my junk in my hand and I'm cranking away to Playboy magazine.  Go ahead and follow that.  And Hugh Hefner sitting there the whole time, they were just ragging him.  I mean, oh, the, I don't remember reading any of the Playboy, Playmates, they call them  Playmates?  Playboy is a, yeah, Penthouse Pets, Playboy Playmates.  See, I don't, I don't remember reading any of the Playboy Playmates likes as being 75-year-old 
[00:14:00]  wrinkled junk.  They use the C word.  And he's just sitting there laughing, ha, ha, ha, you have seven blonde bimbos sitting  in front of the stage.  And they're like, oh, we'll be back after a two-minute break.  We got to change Hugh Hefner's colostomy bag.  He's just sitting there.  I love roasts.  The roasts are brutal.  They were brutal.  Love them.  Gilbert finished the whole thing off, Gilbert Gottfried, in rare form.  He was so rude and crude.  It was hysterical.  Ice-T got up before him and was doing like some kind of kill the white man act. 
[00:14:30]  But why would he be invited to a roast?  He's Ice-T.  I think he's a friar, though.  I'm not sure.  Yeah, I think he is.  Yeah, yeah.  But I mean, yeah.  All right.  So he gets up and he's like, you know, I got nothing to say.  You know, I usually kill you white MFs.  You know, you people look at me like I'd be robbing your house and raping your kids and  ass, you know, he's a curse and white folk and N-word and everything like that.  So Gilbert gets up and he's like, Ice-T took my whole act. 
[00:15:00]  I was going to do that, but I don't care.  I'm going to do it anyway.  You white mother MFs.  I'm going to bust caps in your ass and rape your children.  He did a great job.  Really rude, though, man.  C-word all over the place.  Just very, very rude.  Very funny.  So had a great time.  Then we went to the after party there and I bump into Jackie Martling.  Jackie from Howard Show.  Used to be.  The joke man.  Jackie, the joke man.  Did he tell you he saw me two weeks ago? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, he did.  A couple of weeks ago.  But I'm talking to him for a while.  Now, I don't know the whole situation, but what I do know has been in the press and from  what I heard from him.  It seems to me he got a raw deal.  You know, for years.  The guy was there on Howard Show right from the beginning.  You know, he's pretty much the crew that started it all.  He was at NBC when he picked up Jackie.  And it was always his shtick every time his contract would come up to hold out and walk 
[00:16:00]  off on the show.  Who cares?  That's what he did.  This time, they didn't take what he wanted.  They wouldn't give him what he wanted.  And he walked.  He later thought about it, I guess, said, all right, you know, what's your offer?  Will you want to pay me to come back?  And they said, no, it's off the table.  You're done.  Done.  Yeah, done.  And it seemed to me like, you know, somebody that was there building the foundation of something  so successful like Howard Show should be given the benefit of the doubt. 
[00:16:30]  And, you know, all right, well, we're not going to give you what you wanted.  But here was our initial offer or the offer that we put out last.  Are you willing to take that and then get back on board and start doing the show again?  But they didn't even open that up to him.  It was done.  They threw him to the side.  He said, he goes, you know what it's like?  It's like you missed one Thanksgiving dinner and you're banned from ever coming back.  And I said, yeah, and you helped cook the dinner.  You know what I mean? 
[00:17:00]  It's not like he stepped in when they were already a successful show.  The guy got on there right from the beginning.  And, you know, talking to him, it just seemed like, wow, the guy got the crappy end of the  stick.  And then Howard was there last night and didn't even talk to him.  He didn't even go over.  The guy helped build the foundation for what the Howard Stern Show would become.  And I don't know.  If you ask me, it's kind of crappy.  So are we bringing Jackie to our show there?  Jackie Martling, brand new addition to the Opie and Anthony show.  No. 
[00:17:30]  The guy's doing his own thing, I guess.  He was they wouldn't leave him alone because he was up on the dais.  And they were just like, hey, Jackie, it's getting late.  Don't you have your paper out in the morning?  You know, and he's laughing and stuff.  But they were hammering him.  He's a pretty cool guy.  Yeah, he's all right.  And then a very drunken Adam Carolla.  I talked with him.  So I'm standing upstairs.  It's the after party.  And Adam Carolla is walking around.  And I want to talk to him because we have the same agent and stuff.  So I figure, you know, we'll talk with him and stuff. 
[00:18:00]  And this other guy comes over.  So I'm like ready to walk over and say hi to Adam Carolla.  This guy was C-blocking my conversations.  Like some guy who just comes over and starts talking.  And he, you know, I want to kind of talk to Adam Carolla.  And he was C-blocking my conversation.  You want to buy him a drink?  Right.  Maybe give him a little tickle.  And you were getting C-blocked.  I was getting C-blocked.  Well, that blows.  It was fun and, yeah, unlike anything I usually go to.  I'll put that package through the metal detector, please. 
[00:18:30]  Thank you.  Yes, metal detect that.  And Steve Carell from The Daily Show and Nancy Walls.  They're an item?  I guess they're married or something from The Daily Show?  I don't know.  You're not going to be invited to any celebrity functions ever again.  Why?  Because you're like a gossip queen.  I love this stuff.  Let me tell you something.  You know, you're a gossip queen.  No one's going to invite you, and because of that, they're not going to invite myself as well.  Oh.  Let's hold and find out why you weren't there, okay?  All right.  Please hold.  Please effing hold. 
[00:19:00]  I didn't find this out until I checked my email today why you weren't there.  We were supposed to be up on the dais.  I know.  I needed to get away.  Steve Carell and Nancy Walls, both from The Daily Show.  Steve Carell walking around.  He's got his arm around him.  All of a sudden, I see his hand right on her ass.  Rubbing her ass.  They're co-workers.  Hey.  Yeah.  Dick Snay on the gossip egg.  I kind of thought it was cool.  They're not going to invite you anywhere.  You're talking about...  I thought a lot of people from The Daily Show were gay.  Snyder had three escorts there. 
[00:19:30]  These two are an item.  I didn't say escorts.  I said three hot chicks.  I don't know how he got them.  And one thing I had trouble with.  One thing I had trouble with.  Are you hanging with Liz Smith these days?  Liz Smith.  Yes.  Trading info?  Cindy Adams.  You're going to call the manatees in Boston?  Get in the inside truck?  Give him all the dirt.  I'm new to this kind of thing, Opie.  It was kind of fun to watch.  Yeah, but there's like an unwritten rule, I think, in the story.  No.  Where you just kind of...  I don't care.  You check out a lot of stuff.  I ain't in it.  You keep your mouth shut.  I don't care. 
[00:20:00]  We learned that Jackie's bad-mouthing Howard.  He didn't bad-mouth Howard.  Adam Carolla's got some gay lover.  He didn't...  Adam Carolla.  No, no, no.  I didn't say that.  Schneider's with three escorts.  Three chicks.  Steve Carell and Nancy Walls are going at it.  On the Daily Show.  Who knew?  Any other gossip?  I'm very pissed off at one of the guests that were on the dais.  Okay.  And I think a lot of people can understand this.  Are you going to tell us or page six in the post? 
[00:20:30]  I'll tell page six if they're listening.  This I had a problem with.  I will tell you why.  I will tell you why I had a problem with a guest that was on the dais.  I'm being serious.  All right.  Patricia Hurst.  Can I make sure Cindy Adams is listening right now?  Call her up.  Cindy Adams.  Go ahead.  Patty Hurst.  Patricia Hurst was on the dais.  Now, a lot of times pass by since she was kidnapped.  From her home.  From the Symbionese Liberation Army. 
[00:21:00]  The SLA.  Kidnapped her.  This was a terrorist group out on the West Coast.  Bombed police cars.  Got into a huge firefight with the police department.  From their base operations in one of the buildings.  People killed.  A lot of bombs because they were so inept.  Didn't blow up, thank God.  Because they did it at restaurants and underneath police vehicles.  This is a terrorist organization. 
[00:21:30]  It was.  At the time especially.  It was a terrorist organization.  They were billed as terrorists.  They were a terrorist organization.  That she then, saying she was brainwashed.  I think it was a rich kid.  I think it was a rich kid that wanted to get back at daddy.  She didn't ask to be kidnapped.  But you know something?  After she did, she realized, hey, this is kind of fun.  I'm going to go into this bank with a machine gun and help them rob.  And you know something?  The court saw it the same way because she served jail time as a bank robber and an accomplice to these terrorists. 
[00:22:00]  I think she was hypnotized.  Hypnotized my ass.  This chick was a rich little bitch.  She had the Hearst fortune behind her.  And she just wanted to have a little fun away from daddy and the debutantes.  And who's to say the kidnapping wasn't staged?  Wasn't staged or something.  I don't know.  Hi, Anthony here.  With more gossip.  Hollywood gossip.  Hollywood gossip.  It's Anthony from the Opie and Anthony Show.  We will never be invited anywhere again. 
[00:22:30]  Go ahead.  Find out my take on Patty Hearst.  All right.  Sorry.  At the UF Nerose.  Go ahead.  Who was Steve Carell giving a wedgie to in the elevator?  Well, I'll tell you right after this.  You told.  What about Rob Schneider?  Rob Schneider with five male escorts.  Three hookers.  I don't know what they were.  Adam Carolla had the male escort.  No, Adam Carolla was alone.  Well, then who was C-blocking?  Another guy.  Some guy that went up to talk to me.  I was stepping over to talk to Adam.  He steps over to start talking to me. 
[00:23:00]  And Adam was like starting to walk away.  So you were with the male escort.  No, I don't know who the guy was.  Jesus.  All right.  Patty Hearst.  Sorry.  So to then in this light, in the light of what has happened a couple of weeks ago and  what we're going through now, I do not think a former accused and convicted terrorist should  be on the dais.  Am I stupid for saying this? 
[00:23:30]  Many years have passed.  Yeah.  But you know something?  That was a terrorist organization.  She was a member of it and served time because of it.  But after a while, people just forget.  Exactly.  Thank you.  No big deal.  It's hip to talk to her now.  You know, let's fast forward 25 years or so.  Osama Bin Laden's on the dais.  Let's all clap.  Osama Bin Laden is on the dais.  Let me ask you this.  He's roasting him.  Let me ask you this.  All those comedians, you know, there, and they'd like to live on the edge.  Did anyone take shots at her? 
[00:24:00]  They took, yeah, I think so.  But not that brutal.  Yeah.  You know, not really that brutal.  Maybe no one made the association that you made, like, in that way.  Hey, everyone knows what she did.  You know what the SLA was?  They were bombing cop cars and people.  I mean, for the love of God, why the hell would you have this woman there when we had  just been crushed by terrorists?  That's what I think.  Thank you.  Bravo.  But anything else? 
[00:24:30]  As I look through my...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Joe Pantoliano.  She was a hoo-er.  You know that guy from The Sopranos?  He was there.  I think I got the blow-off from him.  Kind of humbled me a little bit, you know?  But the Russian guy was there, too.  He was the Russian guy from The Sopranos with the ponytail.  Maybe he was too busy doing coke in the bathroom.  I didn't say that, and of course he wasn't.  Is that what you're reporting?  No, I'm just that he was a little more snobby than a lot of the other people there.  They were very open to talk, and... 
[00:25:00]  Well, when you do coke, it's all about you, Joe.  He was a little snotty.  Joe Pantoliano, a snob.  You'll get my full report later in the broadcast.  Go ahead.  Frank DiCaro from The Daily Show, the guy that does the mover and abuse, was there with his...  He hates us.  But you know something?  I was talking to...  I don't understand why he hates us.  He had a great segment on our show with Old Dirty, and we thought that could be a regular feature. 
[00:25:30]  I know.  And he was scared of us and the studio.  I don't think he liked what he believed was the climate here, in there.  But, but, let me tell you something.  He was there with his lovely boyfriend, and we were talking.  And...  What?  That's the guy.  Ouch.  Oh, stop it.  It's not like he's Mario.  What?  Mario doesn't care that people talk about his gayness.  What did I say?  Frank DiCaro was there with his boyfriend.  I didn't say he was gay. 
[00:26:00]  I just said he was there with his boyfriend.  Was it his boyfriend or his boyfriend?  I think they are live-in lovers.  Oh, big.  If I may go that far, just from the conversation.  But he had talked about Mario and Mario's appearance on this show, and how much fun Mario has, and how fun the shows are.  And I think we might be able to get Frank back on this very program and do some movie reviews.  Not anymore, now that he told 15 cities that he's definitely gay.  Oh, stop.  You see the show on The Daily Show, when he does the reviews?  Every joke is a gay joke.  Just because you're a little light in the loafers, maybe he's very funny. 
[00:26:30]  Maybe he's a straight guy.  He's a funny guy.  Anything else?  Sarah Silverman, who we've had here, was very funny.  Nice.  Got to say that.  Abe Vigoda, they bring up every year just so they could do the I thought you were dead joke.  And Abe just stares like he's got that blank dead man stare.  I think he might be dead.  Was he there with his old gay lover?  No, he's not gay.  He's a married guy.  You saw his wife? 
[00:27:00]  No, I didn't.  So what are you trying to say?  I'm saying nothing.  I'm saying nothing.  I'm saying he was there.  Are you trying to say Abe Vigoda's having an affair?  No.  What former fish star is now fishing around for new meat?  We'll tell you.  Ace Frehley was there.  Ace Frehley from Kiss was there.  But Abe is getting the young trim, huh?  Abe getting the young trim, yes.  Wow, look at that.  Yes.  God bless him.  Did you meet Ace Frehley? 
[00:27:30]  No.  I didn't see.  He always had people around him and stuff.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Why were the people around Ace Frehley, Anthony?  Okay.  It's out of the bag.  Ace Frehley is Frank DiCaro's gay lover.  I didn't want that coming out.  Which Kiss member is Kissing Man Meat?  We'll tell you later in the broadcast.  But first, Rob Schneider and his four hookers made his way out of the Beacon, which was the location of the after party. 
[00:28:00]  If you're going to be a gossip columnist, you can't exaggerate.  It was only three.  Right.  Three.  Come on.  Who else was there?  My pal Adam.  He was there.  He didn't get to talk.  They didn't let him roast?  No.  He roasted last year.  He did well.  Yeah.  But, you know, he doesn't have any health issues or anything, does he? 
[00:28:30]  No.  There's no...  Okay.  Adam Ferrara?  Well, why isn't he talking?  I don't know.  He wasn't part of the speaking, but he was on the dais.  Okay.  But it's not like his HIV had anything to do with it.  Oh, my...  Adam Ferrara has AIDS?  Adam Ferrara has AIDS?  I thought everyone knew this.  Adam Ferrara's brave battle with AIDS.  We'll tell you about it.  HIV on the job.  What kind of job was Adam giving to get AIDS? 
[00:29:00]  We'll tell you.  Come on.  Wow.  No!  That's not true.  He said, he's your pal.  I know.  He's my pal.  Isn't anything sacred with you?  What?  You even talk about your inner circle.  I'm not saying anything.  Donald Trump was there, too.  He was sitting right next to Adam.  Oh, yeah?  The Donald.  But they're very...  Donald Trump has no sense of...  You know, like, he doesn't like people making fun of him.  So somebody made a...  What's up with the hair?  Is it real hair?  That's what they say. 
[00:29:30]  It's real hair.  He's doing a bit of a comb over, but it's not a wig.  And somebody said, like, oh, why don't you get what Donald's wearing on his head?  And they showed his face, and Trump was just, like, pissed, man.  You could tell he don't like those jokes.  But it's, like, stapled down, man.  Because in the wind, it's never blown to the side where it's, like, two feet, you know,  long on the right side.  Saw it at Belmont once.  But, no, no.  No, you said it rose like a hovercraft.  Right.  You know what he does?  Most people do the comb over, but they don't attach the side that's combed over.  So a gust of wind comes, and it goes, like a party favor. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  He has it attached somewhere, but the whole top isn't fastened.  So when the wind blew, it was like you ever go into a...  Remember elementary school?  They'd bring the parachute into gym class.  So you'd all grab an edge and lift it up and look underneath it.  That's what his hair does.  It separates from his head, yet it's fastened on all sides.  That's what it is.  Donald Trump's hairpiece or weave?  We'll tell you.  When E.T. continues. 
[00:30:30]  Is this E.T. or...  I don't even know what the theme song is.  That's E.T.  Ace Frehley.  Ace Frehley, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Some that didn't make it.  Jay Thomas.  Who I would have liked to have sat and spoken to.  You know, since we had him on our show, what, two years ago when he still had a job?  Marissa Tomei didn't show up.  I would have liked to have seen her ass.  And...  Looks like you wrecked enough people's lives.  Deborah Harry.  Deborah Harry sang God Bless America and then left. 
[00:31:00]  They didn't see her.  The rest...  And they were goofing on her.  Because Deborah Harry, who lost her voice in 83, like, ooh, they were ragging her pretty bad.  And that is who you want to sing the national anthem, a British heroin addict.  It was God Bless America.  It was wonderful.  Nice.  Great job.  Oh, I got the wrong song.  My stupid...  Was that it?  Deborah Harry did a great job, even though she has the, um...  From what I could tell last night from some private conversation, throat cancer. 
[00:31:30]  How do you know that?  But she did good.  I heard...  It was, like, overheard third-party stuff.  I don't know if it's true.  Deborah Harry's brave battle to keep her voice.  Will she be sounding like Oscar Madison?  We'll tell you.  All right, we have to take a break.  Either that or psoriasis.  She had something.  Jesus.  Anthony's a dirty little snitch. 
[00:32:00]  I couldn't tell.  You're a tattletale.  I love these things.  They're so much fun to go to.  We always wonder why we're not invited to anything.  There's that code of celebrities.  Don't talk.  No.  All right, we don't.  We have to take a break, Anthony.  We have to take a break.  You know what I want to talk about?  We have to talk about Gary Wall, our old boss.  We have to get into that.  Yeah.  Well, there's a book out.  There is a book out by somebody who used to work here at NEW, Richard Neer.  He's got a book about radio, about FM radio. 
[00:32:30]  What's it called?  FM radio.  FM.  And part of it has to do with this station that we broadcast out of,  which was a legendary rock station through the 70s.  And 80s.  And then there was just a huge downfall in rock music and this station.  So he wrote a whole book about it.  And part of it, very small part, but a part of it is about the demise of this station as a rock station.  When Gary Wall, the program director, came in and just completely put the last bullet in the proverbial head of this station. 
[00:33:00]  Gary Wall wrecked NEW and will tell you about it.  A look inside Richard Neer's book.  Why didn't he mention Opie and Anthony in the book?  He just says, those afternoon guys.  Who cares?  I know.  We get it, Richard.  We get it.  That's funny.  But trust me, this is some great inside stuff on the way. 
[00:33:30]  Doesn't matter what city you're in, you can relate to this stuff.  Trust me.  We will be talking about Pop-Tart Roger and...  Hello.  And all sorts of fun stuff in just a minute or two.  And excerpts from this book.  Stuff that we have said many times on this radio show, okay?  Yes.  More inside radio gossip on the way.  Gossip.  Gossip.  It's the O&A show, man.  Gossip.  Opie.  I'm the dick.  Anthony.  I'm an ass.  No one new good show. 
[00:34:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it.  Ah, Anthony, New York Islanders hockey is back.  Yes.  I can't wait.  I got myself a little seasons package this year.  I'm going to be sitting right next to Joey Paisano on the ice.  See you at the home games, man.  We got newcomers, Alexi Yashin and Mike Pekka, and we're ready to bring the Islanders back  to prominence this 30th anniversary season, Anthony. 
[00:34:30]  You notice how I talk like I'm part of the team?  Of course you are.  Season tickets available for the same affordable price as last season.  The New York Islanders have one of the lowest season ticket prices in New York sports  with seats starting as low as $14.  And you know what?  This year, I'm going to actually watch the game instead of spending most of the game  in the bar with everyone else because it's going to be exciting.  And they offer the best season ticket benefits in the NHL, such as free parking for the entire  season, 40% off the box office price, an exclusive meet and greet with the team, and a lot more. 
[00:35:00]  To get on board with the New York Islanders, give them a call right now.  1-800-882-ILES.  That's 1-800-882-ILES.  1-800-882-ILES.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Tool in town tonight in New York City.  I want to apologize to all the ONA fans.  We will not be outside the Tool show because we no longer have a van. 
[00:35:30]  Why?  Every other radio station in America has a station van.  Oh, come on.  It's the most common vehicle in the country, the station van.  You've probably seen the station van in your fine city, whether it's a Hummer or a brand  new van.  Yeah.  RV sometimes.  RV sometimes.  Sure.  Very important for a station to have the station van.  That way you get out to the events.  It shows the station is active out there.  I like the station dune buggy. 
[00:36:00]  Do you like the dune buggy?  You see those every once in a while.  How about that?  With the call letters of the station on the side.  Yeah.  Or the Hummers.  The Hummers, very cool, yes.  We have nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  No one thinks it's important if you do a radio show to have a van.  Well, we have the Wow van.  What happened to the Wow van?  Wow van.  Nice paint job on the side.  Wow.  Wow.  Open Anthony.  We were pretty damn impressed.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, the van stunk.  They made it look like it was a brand new van, but the van was shot.  They painted up a big piece of crap is what happened, right? 
[00:36:30]  Basically, you don't honk your car if...  Oh, I blew the joke.  You don't honk the horn if you drive a crappy car, so...  You can't polish crap.  Yeah.  You can say you don't honk your car.  I know.  You don't car the honk as the...  You don't car honk your honker.  Anyway, we do not have a van anymore, so...  Yeah, I imagine what doesn't think it's important for us to go hang out at the tool show. 
[00:37:00]  What was the final thing?  Shake some hands and hand out some Wow bumper stickers, you know.  What was the final thing that happened?  What do you mean the final thing?  What about the time the van...  The wheel fell off.  Stinky and Pete Johnson.  Yeah, the van was driving back from a Wow sticker stop, and the wheel falls off.  I don't know what happened.  The wheel fell off.  We got a good year out of the van after the wheel fell off.  Hi, it's Pete Johnson.  The wheel fell off.  Who was with Pete when the wheel fell off?  Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Brand new employee, Stinky at the time.  That's right, he was only here a couple weeks, right?  Yeah, we're like, wow, we're trying to kill the new intern. 
[00:37:30]  And the wheel comes flying off the van.  No joke.  Get Stinky.  I was sitting in the passenger seat, and I saw the wheel pass us.  And then we went through a period where every time we wanted to go to an appearance...  Yeah.  ...we had to charge the battery.  Yeah, the battery would always die.  We had to get a jump.  We had to ask other people in the garage downstairs for a jump so we could get the van started,  so we could show off in the city that we're like the coolest radio show.  Oh, sure.  We're pathetic. 
[00:38:00]  And no one cares.  Opie and Anthony doing well, that's all that matters.  We don't need to support them with vans and stuff.  What's the last thing that broke?  I guess, I don't know.  Earl said that there was a really strange sound on Saturday.  It just started, you know, sounding really weird, and it just stopped.  There it is.  Stinky.  What's up?  You probably weren't even listening.  We're talking about the time you were in the van with Pete Johnson and the wheel fell off.  Oh, God.  That was nuts.  Caroling.  Turning a corner.  And all of a sudden, boom.  And we see the wheel run down the street in front of us because we were going pretty slow.  That's great. 
[00:38:30]  So the wheel keeps going straight as the van is turning to the right or whatever, right?  Yeah.  I could fix that with some via ties.  Someone saw the van in Hoboken last night.  What's up with that?  Alan.  Yeah, guys.  Yeah, I was in that night.  Not last night.  They had a big festival in Hoboken on Washington Street.  Yeah.  And WNEW wasn't actually on Washington Street.  They were on kind of like one of the side streets.  So as you walk down the street, I'm looking.  They got all these things.  They got foosball tables.  They got all kinds of stuff. 
[00:39:00]  And I'm looking.  I'm looking.  And they're kind of parked at the end there.  Was the wow van with nobody around and nothing else going on.  Alan.  All right.  I have a confession to make.  We have finally given up on this as well.  But for a while, just to look cool, we were having the wow van towed to locations.  Because you being a listener, like you show up at a car dealership or a concert.  And you walk up, let's say, to the garden or something.  You're like, wow.  O.P. and Anthony here.  Look.  The wow van.  There's the van.  See, we tow it there hours beforehand before you guys show up. 
[00:39:30]  And it looks like we drove.  So what did you do?  Just take it off of the blocks when I got there or something?  Well, we wait for all you guys to leave.  And then when it's dark and no one's around, then we tow it back to the station.  That's how pathetic we are.  Oh, man.  So.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  What was the last straw in the van, Earl?  Well, we drove it to a charity softball game Saturday in Edison.  Yeah.  Every time you go over 55 miles an hour, the van just starts to vibrate violently. 
[00:40:00]  It just starts shaking back and forth and makes all these weird noises.  The radio doesn't work.  It's gone.  Dude, I said three years ago we should get a new van because someone's going to die in that thing.  Why aren't we getting a new vehicle?  Because, Anthony, management around here, you know, I mean, Ken has helped us out a lot.  But it's like, hey, O.P. and Anthony, they got great ratings.  That's all that matters.  They don't understand you need a support.  We don't want a van, though.  We want a new vehicle, but I haven't quite put my finger on what we need yet.  We got to do what Puffy did at the VMAs. 
[00:40:30]  What?  One of those freaking semis, man.  Say what?  With wow on the side?  A tractor trailer.  Come on.  A tractor trailer.  It's not practical, but damn.  You're willing to have that parked in front of Madison Square Garden for the tool show?  Well, people would be like, holy S, these guys are serious.  Right?  I don't know where you would put stuff to give out.  Yeah.  We don't have anything to give out anyway.  Someone's just bitching on the instant feedback.  You guys don't ever give away anything.  Maybe that little thing behind you, Anthony, they could put a little wow sticker on that.  Yeah, on the Razor Rollerboard scooter. 
[00:41:00]  Well, we could do that.  We just have those as vehicles.  Anyway, have fun at the tool show.  Oh, of course we won't go down, and of course, well, we still don't even have a marketing director,  so we can't even get clever with our appearances, and maybe just have the road crew go down there  with knapsacks to hand out wow stickers.  Why don't we go?  That would be too smart.  The old one.  For anyone to figure out on their own.  So I'm assuming no one will be at the tool show tonight, so enjoy yourself.  Oh, it's amazing. 
[00:41:30]  Anyway, this could seg into how pathetic this radio station was before we got here.  And it's actually better than it was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Richard Neer.  Richard Neer wrote a book.  FM, The Rise and Fall of Rock Radio, it's called.  And this station that we broadcast from in New York, WNEW, is featured prominently in this book.  He worked here for how long? 
[00:42:00]  28 years?  Almost 30.  Almost 30 years?  Yeah, because part of the dig that Gary gave him is, hey, 28 doesn't have the ring of 30, does it?  So he was here for 30 Rocktobers.  30 Rocktobers.  28 Rocktober.  Who else could say they were at one station for 30 Rocktobers?  Does a station in your city say Rocktober?  Do you mean they play a lot of rock music in October?  Rocktober.  I don't know what it is.  They just call it Rocktober.  Wow.  We're going to have our Rocktoberfest.  Anthony, we're on so many stations across America. 
[00:42:30]  I would bet money right now.  One of the stations we're on.  And, you know, the listeners from the other cities have to help us out now.  Are we broadcasting on a Rocktober station?  Rocktober station that has Rocktoberfest.  Happy Rocktober first.  We're rocking in Rocktober.  There you go.  Plenty of blocks from all your favorite artists.  Rocktober.  Anyway, go ahead.  So there's some info on this station and how this guy Richard Neer met the program director that we had when we got hired here. 
[00:43:00]  Because he's the one that hired us.  Gary Wall, the program director that used to be here during the ass end of this station being a music station, was the guy that fired Richard Neer.  So he wrote a book.  And now, yeah, he fired everybody.  This station, it was one of those legendary rock stations. 
[00:43:30]  Like, a lot of cities have them.  You can remember the station being around from the 60s, the 70s.  This was it, though, this place.  Yeah.  Scott Muni himself was on the tarmac when the Beatles landed.  Right.  Doesn't get much better than that.  Because I was a baggage handler.  Right.  Yeah, he...  I remember taking Ringo's bag.  Wilson from Brooklyn, 1.7.  Go ahead.  1.7.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  No, he was asking.  I just had a...  How many miles from World Trade Center?  1.7 we're down to? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  Just following the myth.  All right, we got...  All right, so we're going to read excerpts from the book about our old boss that hired  us here in New York?  Yeah.  You know?  The guy had a vision.  We were going nowhere in Boston.  Mm-hmm.  Working for a guy named Dave Dickless that had no clue, no vision.  A lot of program directors in this business have no vision whatsoever.  Yeah.  And Gary Wall, he had some type of vision.  That was to hire us. 
[00:44:30]  Here's what he was up against.  He is at a station that is floundering in the ratings.  Just going down the crapper.  It had been consistently going down year after year for many years, this station.  So, here is the Das Wunderboy, Das Wunderkind, Gary Wall, that is going to fix this station  once and for all and bring it back to the greatness that it once had.  Back, back.  Back, back, back. 
[00:45:00]  And so, I guess the way he got the job was to sit down and tell them what he had told  everybody.  What he had told us when he interviewed us for the job here, guys, I got a plan.  Yeah, I got a plan.  We're like, a plan?  Great.  Okay.  We like this.  A guy with a vision and a plan and we'll come aboard.  We'll be part of this plan.  Gary, what's the plan?  You don't worry about that.  You don't worry about that.  I got it all right up here.  You got to tell people, too, in Afternoon Drive, the show we were going to take over was 
[00:45:30]  in last place, like 28th place.  Oh, yeah.  Like stations that don't even broadcast in English were beating this station in this  time slot.  An abomination.  And what they did was they gave this guy, Gary, pretty much free reign to fix this station  because it had been in such disrepair for so many years that he was the guy that they  said, all right, whatever you got to do.  Because a lot of the guys that came in before him really had their hands tied.  There were jocks that sat in these seats with contracts that were so old and they were making 
[00:46:00]  so much money and they could not get them out of these deals.  The only reason they were here, not because they were doing well, not because they were  getting ratings, because they had contracts.  That's it.  So finally, they bring in Gary.  He sold them some great line to get him the job here.  And he now was going to fix this goddamn station, whatever it took.  The average age of the full-time staff when we arrived was probably over 60.  Yeah.  Oh, it was ridiculous. 
[00:46:30]  Am I exaggerating, Earl?  Give or take a few years, it was probably 60.  High 50s.  High 50s.  Easy.  Scotso brought that way up, that curve.  Brought it way up.  Yeah.  And so Gary was going to come and fix the whole thing.  First thing was get rid of the old jocks.  Their thing used to be classic rock, classic jocks.  Classic rock, classic jocks.  That was the big...  Oh, classic rock, classic jocks.  So I'm going to hear old music played by old people. 
[00:47:00]  Great.  That makes me want to tune in.  Nice and competitive there.  So Gary has this plan.  We later find out there is no plan.  He never had a plan.  There's no plan.  He never had a plan.  The only thing he knew was that he was going to fire people.  Who he was replacing them with, he didn't have a clue.  Except for us.  What he was going to do formatically, what kind of music the station was playing, he didn't  have a clue.  Oprah brought up a great point.  What music were we playing here? 
[00:47:30]  We were playing every record that every other station didn't want to play.  Didn't want to play.  No joke.  How many times did we spin Kenny Wayne Shepard?  When we were trying to be cool, we'd play the third eye blind song that no one else wanted.  Right.  We were playing everything because, again, a lot of these stations in New York that are  owned by the company, the same company we're owned by, didn't want us competing with them.  So if we got a little too close to what... 
[00:48:00]  Are you talking about Steve Queenston?  Steve Queenston over at K-Rock.  Steve Queenston.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If we got a little too...  What?  Earl had a long weekend.  I got to think about a lot of good things.  If we started playing a little too much new music, he'd get pissed.  Queenston, right?  Queenston.  Right.  And then the classic rock, we couldn't play that because it wasn't working in the first  place.  That's what this station was.  I found out he didn't like being called the Abercrombie and Fitch Midget, so...  Okay.  Let's try...  Steve Queenston. 
[00:48:30]  Let's try Steve Queenston for a while.  That's funny.  So Gary flushes the ball, gets rid of all these classic jocks, and starts replacing them...  One by one.  One by one.  That was the problem, my friends.  So Opie and Anthony, they didn't want to know us.  They...  The jocks around here did not want to know Opie and Anthony.  They hated us.  Well, we definitely represented change.  They knew that if we were coming in, they were going in.  They knew if we were successful, they were completely done. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  But they couldn't wash everyone out at once.  Scotso stayed here for quite some time after we came aboard.  Carol Miller was here.  She's a classic jock from the 70s and 80s, I guess.  Mr. Herman.  Dave Herman, another one.  He did the morning show here.  Pat St. John, another legendary jock here in New York.  But it was time to go.  It was time for them to go because Gary Wall... 
[00:49:30]  Ten years before it happened, it was time to go.  Right.  That's what these guys don't understand.  Gary had this plan.  They got ten more years than they should have.  Gary had this plan, which was no plan, but it consisted of getting rid of all these people.  He brought in people to replace these people with that had no business being in radio.  Remember?  Joe Taggart.  Joe Taggart.  He hired...  He hired...  So you fire a rock...  One of these legendary rock jocks.  Yeah.  Okay, that sat in these very seats, Anthony. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  For over 20 years.  And you replace them with a bartender from Long Island.  Right.  A bartender from Long Island.  You replace them with that.  That was my first sign.  To spin the same songs that the classic jocks were spinning.  And they had the knowledge, at least.  Right.  You shouldn't have gotten rid of them until you had a plan and people there to take their  position and change the station. 
[00:50:30]  Then they brought the chick in from, like, the woods of New Hampshire.  Yeah.  Who was supposed to set New York on fire and she ended up, like, playing solitaire while  the music was playing.  Yeah.  Lisa.  Garvey.  Yeah.  Lisa Garvey?  Lisa Garvey.  Who is a very nice lady, by the way.  Hey, you know, whatever.  But when you're a PD and you're given free reign to do something with a station and you  know it has to be changed, you flush the toilet.  And then you have a huge line where here was old, here is new.  We start now. 
[00:51:00]  No.  It was this mishmash gray area where it changed over from the old NEW to the new one.  So, the whole deal with the plan, though, Gary's plan, that never had a plan, Richard  Neer hits on this as he talks about it.  God, that could have been the longest set up in radio history, Anthony.  Well, I just wanted everybody to get a little gist of Gary and what everybody thought of  him.  Yeah.  Because it wasn't just the us. 
[00:51:30]  If you were doing a radio show by yourself and, you know, you didn't have a name for  yourself, in those air check sessions, you would have gotten pounded.  I would have gotten pounded on that one.  Okay, Anthony, get right to the point next time.  Make it quick.  Do your setups quick and get back to the music.  Less words would be appreciated.  If you can't set it up in 30 seconds, then you know what?  You probably shouldn't talk about it on the air.  Besides, it's Rocktober 1st.  We have plenty of blocks to play.  Rocktober.  Did we get any...  Yeah, the big wazoo.  The big wazoo's doing Rocktober?  Colleen.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, what's up?  Not much.  How are you?  Pretty good.  So you're listening to us on the big wazoo in Columbus?  The big wazoo in Columbus, yes.  And they...  Doing Rocktober.  Oh.  Oh.  You'd think they could do something better by now.  All right.  And Colleen, what are the jocks doing?  Are they real serious about it and all excited?  Like, hey, everybody, it's Rocktober.  Yeah, exactly.  Look how witty I am.  Putting the word rock in the middle of October.  Rocktober.  Rocktober.  We're going to do Rockcember.  And Rock, uh, Rockuary. 
[00:52:30]  There you go.  Make sure you mail the station with a self-addressed stamped envelope so we can send out a Rocktober  calendar.  With all the special rock events we have planned for you this month.  Ugh.  Awful.  That's serious.  Hey, I just wanted to say I love you guys.  I'm absolutely addicted to you.  Well, thank you.  Could you tell someone in Columbus?  Because we could use the help.  All right?  All right.  Take care.  All right.  Thanks, Colleen.  Vic, you're checking in.  I like how the building moves a tenth of a mile per day but doesn't move on the weekend. 
[00:53:00]  Because that's part of it.  But that's because I'm following the math.  All right.  He said every time you're on the air.  All right.  I have to explain the math again.  It doesn't move on the weekend.  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Here's a...  Oh, by the way, 97 Rock in Buffalo doing Rocktober.  Doing Rocktober.  You've got to love Rocktober.  Awful station.  Here's some excerpts.  The most unfunny man in morning radio history who has the same last name as you, Mr. Norton.  Really?  Snorton Norton. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, my God.  God awful.  Did they call that?  Oh, yeah.  No, they don't.  Oh, yeah.  No, they don't.  Ugh.  He's an icon in Buffalo.  I don't know.  I think the people in Buffalo have to, like, get the wax out of their ears and really listen  to what he does on his show.  Mullet and a bad hairdo.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Yuck.  Anyway, go ahead, Anthony.  All right.  Here's some excerpts from...  Brother Louise is chuckling right now in Rochester.  That was for you, bro.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Richard Neer's book. 
[00:54:00]  The abuse is flying today.  He brings up Scott Herman, who was the general manager of this station.  They gave him the job.  He was the general manager of the news station upstairs, and they decided to give him this  piece of crap at the time and try to fix it.  He spent all his time upstairs at the news station that was very successful and still  is, and gave no attention to the bastard stepchild, which was this station, being run  into the ground by Gary Wall.  You know, Richard Neer never got along with us, this guy. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I know.  That wrote this book.  But, you know, he makes them...  You've got to give him props.  This stuff is...  Some of the stuff that we're about to read is accurate and very...  Oh, yeah.  ...very inside and very funny.  This was...  I'll even set it up longer, Opie.  Now, this is...  When me and Opie would drive home together out to Long Island, we'd talk about the show  and whatever when we first got here.  There was one day we were driving home that finally one of us opened our mouths and said... 
[00:55:00]  I did.  You said, hey, what do you think of Gary?  Gary Wall.  I was like, um...  And he said, what's with this plan?  Do you think...  And I turned and said, there is no plan, right?  He goes, that's exactly what I said.  And we went back and forth going, there's no plan.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The captain doesn't know how to work the tiller.  We don't know where we're going.  Well, when we were interviewed, don't forget, the plan was in that book.  He had a book.  But he wouldn't allow us to see the book. 
[00:55:30]  We couldn't open the book.  It was a big black binder book.  He goes, I got the plan right here.  That was probably empty.  Right here.  So we finally went, oh, my God, there's no plan.  Oh, we go.  Can we see the plan?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Not until you sign that contract.  Oh, no.  Jimmy Kimmel's never going to come on our show now.  Oh, well.  He's good friends with Gary.  Anyway, how many people are we going to trash in this break?  We're driving home.  And that's when we realized there was no plan.  And that was a very huge turning point for this program because that's when we decided 
[00:56:00]  we were not listening to anybody anymore.  Right.  Here at this station.  We would not even listen to what Gary said.  Kind of like when we decided not to listen to Dave Dickless up in Boston.  Was that the day he was hired?  Yeah.  Yes, I do believe that was the day we decided not to.  But, yeah, Gary, we decided not to listen to him.  And thank God because we're still here.  I hope someone's keeping track of all the people we're trashing in radio on this break.  It'd be fun to take a look at on the instant feedback.  Here's what Richard Neer says about Gary Wall.  I consider this man to be the most enigmatic program director that I've ever worked for. 
[00:56:30]  For most of his 21-month reign, he was here for 21 months.  The staff tried to figure out what he wanted for the station.  We couldn't.  And the conclusion we were led to was that he couldn't either.  There were two alternatives.  Here it is.  One, he had no knowledge or appreciation for the heritage of the radio station  and planned all along to become an extreme FM talk station.  I could definitely say no. 
[00:57:00]  That isn't the case.  He didn't know where the hell this station was going when we got here.  There wasn't a plan that it was going to become an FM talk station  until we started playing less music because we didn't like the music.  And we started talking more because, God forbid, we played another one of these crappy songs.  Our ratings would have been going even further into the toilet.  We completely lucked out.  We decided we weren't going to play music and we were going to talk.  We've never done a talk show.  No.  Can't you tell out there?  Please.  We've only met this like less than two years.  So the only reason this station ever went talk 
[00:57:30]  was because we decided on our own to blow off anything Gary Wall was saying and talk.  Right.  And when it started working, that's when it was decided now the whole station should be a talk station.  And then Andrea would throw the list of tunes.  Yeah.  She was the music director.  At us every afternoon and going, I don't even know why I'm printing this up anymore.  You're not going to play it.  Mm-hmm.  And throw it at us.  Like, chill out, man.  We've got something going now.  Remember when off the cuff one day I said, oh, I want to hear Rob Zombie, Living Dead Girl, 
[00:58:00]  I think, or Dragula or something.  And you said, sure.  Threw it on.  Andrea lost her mind.  Gary Wall lost his mind.  They freaked out because we were, we picked one song that we wanted to hear that, you know,  would have upset Steve Queenston at the K-Rock and was against what they wanted.  Yeah, a little insight into radio, like when a DJ goes off the map and plays a song that  he's not supposed to, all hell breaks loose at the station.  That's why when you listen to a station, they make believe they're playing a song for you 
[00:58:30]  or playing requests.  It's not true.  It's all written down.  It's all written down on a computer.  The whole week, they know what they're playing for a whole given week, in every hour, every  minute.  Don't worry about it.  And that's the only time a DJ gets to, you know, look cool, like, oh, they're getting  a song on for you.  Yeah.  No, they're not.  Your song just happened to be coming up.  Yeah, you record enough people requesting songs.  That's Matt Devote.  Matt Devote used to, like, tape phone calls.  Yeah.  No, no.  Matt, you're cool, though.  You're not on my list, man. 
[00:59:00]  Matt would record calls.  That's what you do.  And then when, like, when the call corresponds with the song you have to play in that given  hour, you then play the request.  Matt Devote, another legendary rock doc in New York, doing great in sales upstairs.  He's a sales phenomenon.  This is painful, man.  But isn't it true that you used to, like, tape calls and then, like, a week would go  by and that song would finally come up and you go, oh, I just happened to have someone  requesting that rare Springsteen song.  A lot of times they try to do it live, but if they really ask for a really cool song and 
[00:59:30]  you knew you couldn't get it on that day, you'd use it as an excuse to get that song  on the next opportunity you could.  Right.  You know, like, some guy calls up for some, like, great Stevie Ray Vaughan or something.  You know, I'm like, I'm holding on to it for a week or whatever.  Until it pops up.  Well, it would never pop up, but you would need a reason to get it in there.  Until Selector decided to pick the Stevie Ray Vaughan song.  Yeah, it's very pretty determined.  Go ahead, man.  So, yeah, he had planned on this station becoming an after-then-talk station.  No.  He was convinced that he could make his reputation by a rising phoenix-like from the ashes of 
[01:00:00]  a failed station with this hot new format.  No.  Any moves he made while it was a rock station were intended for the purpose of self-immolation.  What?  So that by the time he switched formats, no one would care.  Oh, so what he's saying is he undermined the whole rock thing by being confused and being  stupid about his music choices.  So it would fail, so he would be able to go into the FM talk thing.  No, he's not that calculated. 
[01:00:30]  Or, two, he came into this job with no agenda, willing to take it wherever the research indicated  it should go.  Unfortunately, his radio skills were so unformed that he lacked the ability to discover a clear  path and the will to follow it.  There it is.  Bingo.  That's the Gary Wall we know.  Hold on, I've got to back up for a second.  Don, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, Matt did that to me, but he didn't wait a week.  He waited three months.  Three months later? 
[01:01:00]  You heard your request three months later?  Three months later, man.  I'm at work.  It's nine o'clock at night, and he's on doing that all request hour, so I requested it.  I heard it on a Saturday, like three months later.  You're like, wait, that's me.  I'm like, hey, man, that's me on the radio.  Wait a minute, I've got no phone here.  What's going on?  I was freaking out, man.  It was cold.  It was so long, you didn't even remember making the call, I bet.  That's classic.  Thanks, Don.  Have a good one, man.  Keep up.  Instant, instant, instant request.  Request, instant request.  Go ahead, answer.  And Richard seems to favor the latter alternative, which is the one that he came in with no agenda. 
[01:01:30]  He didn't.  It seemed that after years of hiring managers who were afraid to tamper with the staff due  to personal reverence of their legend, Wall was brought in to inspect the place as an alien from another planet would.  Like he's kind of, they hired this guy because he had such a, he was not radio.  He wouldn't do things as regular radio guy would.  Maybe the new ideology here would perk things up when it didn't. 
[01:02:00]  Some of the people were perplexed.  And there was a lot of infighting going on here.  There were jocks that were strictly N.E.W. jocks.  And then they, they didn't like the jocks that came over from other stations.  From PLJ.  Okay, so there was infighting between the air staff.  Even though they were working on the same station for 20 years, they still held the grudge.  Just because of where they came from, which is kind of stupid.  Hey, we're all for holding grudges against A-holes, but not because of where you came from. 
[01:02:30]  Go ahead.  Wall's, here are two examples that illustrated the problem with Wall.  At the first meeting he held with the staff, Wall was asked what the station should be called.  Should it be W-N-E-W, W-N-E-W-F-M, or just N-E-W?  Should the slogan be Where Rock Lives, Classic Rock, Classic Jocks, or New York's Rock Station?  A lot of time is spent on other stations trying to figure out exactly what to call it. 
[01:03:00]  Right, what do we call it?  It doesn't make a goddamn difference.  At various times in our history we had been known by these things and more.  Whatever, he replied.  It's not important.  Whatever.  It's not important.  What if they want to call it, like, Moose 1027?  Well, whatever.  Get a cute little, like...  The Moose.  Get a cute little mascot.  The Beaver.  Something like that.  What if they just started calling it the Beaver?  I don't care.  It's not important.  Whatever.  1027, the Beaver. 
[01:03:30]  Gary Wall.  At that initial meeting, Wall suggested we should all speak to his secretary and schedule a getting-to-know-you meeting with him privately.  Good idea.  When not in a public setting with peers, some of the staff might open up and give more honest opinions.  So I dutifully arranged a meeting, given my experience with the previous PDs.  I resolved to be a bit more circumspect with the new guy until I got a read on the lay of the land kind of thing.  As I marched into his office, he sat at a small round table devoid of clutter. 
[01:04:00]  CNBC's stock quotations silently screaming on the television behind him.  We've talked about this on our show.  We would go into meetings with Gary Wall.  We'd sit down.  And he was calling these meetings every day at 1 o'clock or every day at noon.  We'd have to meet with this guy.  We'd sit down.  Nothing would get accomplished.  Nothing.  He would talk about his plan but not talk about it.  And then look and go, oh, my American Express is down too.  Ah.  You know what you've got to do, guys?  You've got to diversify your portfolio and add in these tech stocks slowly. 
[01:04:30]  And then all of a sudden we'd look and go, well, now it's 2 o'clock.  There's our hour meeting.  All right, Gary.  All right, great.  Hey, feeling good.  Feeling pumped.  Ready to go.  Ready to go get them.  All right, Gary.  And we'd walk out of there going, nothing was said.  Nothing was said.  We have problems with promotions.  We have problems.  Nothing.  Even though I knew his office with the round table and stuff instead of the big desk was corporate window dressing, 
[01:05:00]  he kind of liked the fact that he sat at a round table and not at a desk.  Approaching things with an open mind, I sat down and met Wall's blank gaze.  Dead on.  So, he started, what can I do for you?  He says dead on.  The gaze was the best.  He would look at you sometimes and it would seem like an eternity passed,  even though it was just a couple of seconds, because he wouldn't say anything.  You'd be like, hey, Gary, what's up?  And he'd look at you like, just stare. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, how you doing?  He would look right through you.  So.  Oh, my God.  He's looking right through me at the wall behind me.  So, he started, what can I do for you?  And Richard goes, you suggested this meeting.  I said, you wanted to get to know us.  Here I am.  Do you want to know about my history here, for starters?  No, not really.  Why is that relevant?  The guy worked here for 28 years.  He saw, like, the ups and downs of this station.  Saw what worked. 
[01:06:00]  Saw what didn't.  But Gary didn't want to hear any of that.  He answered coldly.  Well, why is it relevant?  He wasn't making this easy.  I perhaps foolishly thought that as a senior staff member next to Muni in terms of years at the station, my counsel might be of some value.  Well, I just thought that since I've been here 28 years, that, and then he's cut off by Gary.  28.  Doesn't have the same ring as 30, does it?  That's Gary's, like, wacky mind just spinning.  This is very accurate.  I guess not. 
[01:06:30]  Rich is, uh, I tried not to react to what seemed to be a deliberate insult.  Maybe he was just trying to be funny.  At any rate, he says, uh, I've done mornings.  I've been PD.  Again, he gets cut off.  Well, gee, everyone's been PD here at one time or another, even the janitor, from what I hear.  If he wanted to imply that my opinions were as valued as the janitor's, he's gotten his message across.  This was an odd way of getting to know a valued employee.  Strange, but I was getting another message entirely. 
[01:07:00]  Okay, boss, I just clean up here.  What do you want me to do?  Kind of thing.  Properly humbled, I continued.  All right, Gary, I'm just here to find out what you want us to do.  What's the plan?  Here's Gary's answer.  No plan.  What do you want to do?  I've done every kind of radio there is, from classical to talk.  I'm just trying to gather the approach you're looking for.  High energy, lots of talk.  Tight with no talk.  What do you want?  Gary goes, whatever you're comfortable with.  It's up to you.  I'll be listening and evaluating everyone here from ground zero over the next month. 
[01:07:30]  Do whatever you like.  I laugh perhaps a bit nervously.  Can you tell me what criteria you'll be judging us by?  Whatever.  If I like what I hear, you'll be here.  If I don't, you won't.  Simple as that.  I'll try one more time in English.  Well, what do you like?  What are you looking for?  Nothing.  I'll know it when I hear it.  One more attempt at adulation to keeping my job. 
[01:08:00]  Whatever role you see me in, I'm willing to discuss.  I'm not here to make waves or challenge you.  I just want to execute your ideas the way you want me to and help the station win.  Good.  That's what he says.  Good.  He says this casually and dismissively as if I've just offered him coffee with cream or without.  No acknowledgement that I was pledging unconditional loyalty to the call letters.  He just totally blew him off.  Right.  So that was what the air staff was dealing with. 
[01:08:30]  A guy who had no, he had no vision, no plan.  And we were all on this ship and realized, oh my God, the captain doesn't know where we're going  and doesn't even know how to steer it if he did have some kind of a plan.  I knew there was a key.  And we're surrounded by rocks.  Yeah.  Let's see.  We should take a break, Ant.  Oh, okay.  And then we'll get into the part where we came aboard. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, we could do a little of that.  And Beer Thursdays.  Oh, we could do Free Beer Thursday, talk about that.  Hello.  And Roger, the Pop-Tart marketing guy.  The guy that was supposed to get us, what, three?  Three what?  Guys, this guy can come in and get three Mercedes in five minutes.  I guarantee it.  He's unbelievable.  Yeah, that's what we heard.  That was the promise.  What did we get?  A giant Pop-Tart.  Nothing.  A lot of stolen prizes.  We got nothing.  I don't know.  You think this is interesting to the people out there? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, you never know.  I think so.  Let us know if you think it's interesting, okay?  Oh, by the way, as we continue down this road, the top nine at nine that our old station  Boston does it, AF?  Yeah.  Complete sham.  Oh, yeah.  Please.  The jock is handed the top nine songs, and then, like, you know, you call up and say,  hey, I want to hear, I don't know, Smooth Criminal.  Well, and guess what?  Hey, that's the most requested song. 
[01:10:00]  It's fake.  They invite their listeners to call up so they can get the top nine requests, Jim, you see.  I wouldn't, I've never had a request.  But see, the list is given to the jock every night.  Have you ever requested?  And you already know which is number nine and which is number one.  You know who played my request?  Eddie Trunk.  The only guy that's ever played my request is Eddie Trunk.  He's got free reigns to do that.  Yeah, Eddie can play what he wants.  That's the God's honest truth.  He's, like, the only guy that can play what he wants.  Yeah, a guy that does a really good metal show on the weekends here in New York.  He's allowed to play whatever he wants. 
[01:10:30]  That's the truth.  Yeah.  And not many jocks can do that these days in radio.  All those top nine at nine, all that crap is so fake it's not even funny.  They're the worst.  Awful.  They're just tricking their listeners with more fake radio, make them believe you actually have an influence on what the top nine songs are.  Hey, can I hear a little Sabbath?  Yeah, we'll see if we can get to it.  Yeah.  Worms.  All right, Ant, let's take a break and maybe we'll continue with this.  Maybe we won't.  Maybe we'll save it for another day.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:11:00]  Opie World, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah, sure.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony.  All right, it's a go, I guess.  Sure.  People want more from our old boss.  Well, it's also because it's in a book now.  This is the stuff yet.  We've ragged on this for, uh, during the course of the three and a half years or so that we've been here in New York. 
[01:11:30]  But now it's in a book.  I love it.  Immortalized forever.  Want to give a quick, Anthony?  Quick.  Yes.  A little, um...  Set up here.  Yeah.  Richard Neer used to be a jock here at WNEW here in New York.  And, uh, he wrote a book.  FM.  About radio. 
[01:12:00]  About WNEW and radio in New York and everywhere.  And, uh, he was fired by our old boss, the one that hired us, Gary Wall.  And he wrote about his experiences of dealing with Gary.  And, uh, it kind of reminded us, again, of some of the experiences we've had with Gary.  Who was just, uh, he was lost here.  Everyone butted heads with this guy.  We kind of had it a little easy because he never yelled at us. 
[01:12:30]  He would always kiss our ass because we were the only thing that he had invested.  The only hope he had.  The only hope at this station.  And everyone else, he would turn around and just curse at and badmouth.  Ben used to get the brunt of, uh, his wrath a lot.  What were some of the times he blew up at you?  Oh, over nothing.  I mean, uh, you know, he once told me, do you have an effing brain?  Do you have an effing brain?  Then use it.  In a meeting with, like, six other people.  I mean, Lisa from Salem. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, he was good with embarrassing people in front of other people.  He was good at making girls cry, too.  Yeah, then I went in the bathroom one time to go to the bathroom.  And he's in there, started yelling at me in the bathroom.  And, uh, another time he completely, in a meeting, contradicted himself from two days before.  So I corrected him a big mistake with, uh, the mental case, Gary, that screamed at me.  You know, here I was, like a 22-year-old kid, a mental patient who needed to take his value in.  You know, I hadn't taken it for the day.  So Gary didn't know what he was doing, and, uh, then they started firing all the classic jocks that were here. 
[01:13:30]  Legendary jocks.  They fired everyone.  We've seen about 100 people come and go at this place since we've been here.  Remember Pete Fornatale?  Pete Fornatale.  He was bumped to, uh, from middays to late nights.  Says a time period he'd never done in his 30 years of professional radio.  When he didn't quit at the change, he was fired and replaced by someone from a small market in New Hampshire.  That was Lisa Garvey.  I gotta be honest, I like this guy.  You think you would? 
[01:14:00]  Yells at people, he makes chicks cry, and he fires the elderly.  Dennis Elsis.  Dennis Elsis was, uh, dismissed and replaced by another unknown in the market.  And, uh, Gary Wall called my brother, Richard Neer's brother, while he was on summer vacation and told him that he needn't hurry back.  He was being replaced.  He says we were being picked off one at a time.  That's a cowardly move, by the way.  Yeah.  I hate when people get fired over the phone. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  If you're gonna fire someone, have the balls to do it in person.  So then, uh, we come into play.  Here.  It says Scott Muni, Scotzo, legendary jock, he's over at the Q, Classic Rock Station here in New York now, does his hour show.  Doing great.  Scott Muni and Dave Herman were fired on November 13th, 98.  The afternoon shock jocks that Wall had hired made fun of them both as dinosaurs who should have been extinct 20 years before. 
[01:15:00]  Not true.  Yeah, we made some...  We made some...  Oh, yeah, but it wasn't...  He's making it sound like that's all we said about these guys.  And he forgets to mention some of the abuse that was doled out by, not Scott, but some of the abuse that was doled out by the classic jocks who hated us just for coming into this station.  Yeah, we had a fight.  So where's that?  We had legendary fights on the air, matter of fact.  Where's that?  Rick is finding one as we speak. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, and this was before we said anything.  We didn't just get on the air and start bad-mouthing the jocks that were here.  Matter of fact, we had a good relationship with Mr. Muni.  Yeah.  They reveled in sleaze as Dave's ex-wife joined them on the air to humiliate him with disparaging remarks about his sexual prowess.  The ratings had slid back down to the region 1.1 region with the new morning show at an embarrassing .4.  Mason and Kalinsky.  Well, no one knew what they were supposed to be doing. 
[01:16:00]  We knew.  We knew what we were supposed to be doing.  And we finally stopped listening to management and did it.  And knock wood, and looking back, we ended up doing well.  Talks about his last show when he knew he was out the door and was able to play the music he wanted to play.  Cool, man.  It was invigorating and frightening.  I'm going out as a rebel.  I'm going to play what I want. 
[01:16:30]  Going out.  On top.  I listened to my final record, Springsteen's Racing in the Streets.  I closed with a brief farewell and uttered the first and last time, for the first and last time, WNEW-FM, Where Rock Lived.  Wait a minute.  He replaced the S with a D?  Yeah, that's his parting shot.  There you go.  Because they used Where Rock Lived.  But now, because it was his last show and he knew that changes were coming, Where Rock Lived.  Oh, my God.  Mercifully, the day after I signed off, September 13, 1999, the station became FM Talk at 1027. 
[01:17:00]  Not even acknowledging its legendary call letters.  Now, why mercifully the day after he signed off?  I don't know.  I don't get that, but...  Made his statement accurate.  And then he says that Gary Wall was fired a few weeks later.  Ostensibly, because he had no control over his afternoon team.  Who would that be, Anthony? 
[01:17:30]  It's in the book.  It's got to be true.  Fired, because he had no control over his afternoon team.  And what did we do this time?  Who had played an immature prank on the White House at a time when CBS was seeking approval of the Viacom merger.  Oopsie!  Everyone in Boston right now is shaking their heads.  Oh, do these guys ever learn?  No.  We just want to invite Hillary to a Yankee game, because she claimed to be, you know, from New York and stuff.  They say it was also an excuse to end his disastrous regime. 
[01:18:00]  And this latest example of his slipshod management gave him a tangible reason.  Slipshod management.  His out-of-control afternoon team that he hired.  We're like the kids that grow up and kill their parents.  We're loved at first.  Then we'll end up putting a friggin' knife in your chest.  It's the Eric and Dylan show.  You know, he hired us.  You know, he raised us.  And then we turn around and kill you.  That was great.  We've had, since being together on the radio, Anthony, one, two, three, four, five PDs. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  They have finally given up on us and realized they can't say anything to us.  We just can't do our thing.  Jeremy, here now, is just like our friend.  Yeah.  He's like a friend.  Yeah.  We go to lunch with him.  Hang out.  Hey, friend.  If he's got ideas about something that he thinks would be good for the show, or if we  have good ideas that we think is good for the station or something, it's exchanged in  a friendly way.  Friendly way.  Right.  We'll go, we'll take that onto consideration. 
[01:19:00]  Thank you.  I barely consider Ken Stevens my boss.  Tell you the truth.  I got the number of the top guy.  The big dog.  I.  Ken, I like Ken because he pays for every lunch we go out to.  He's a man, though, that has a backbone.  I know.  That is willing to put his job on the line for his boys.  Absolutely.  Do you hear that, Dave Dickless?  A guy that marched right down the street with us to see Mel on the top floor. 
[01:19:30]  During the, we are so sure we're getting fired walk.  That's right.  Back in January, I think it was.  He didn't have to come with us.  No.  He sat right there.  I'm sure after the meeting, he wishes he didn't come with us because he took some of  the, some of the heat from that, too.  And if we got fired that day, I was convinced that Ken would have stood up and said, well,  if you're firing them, I have to leave, too.  Oh, right.  There's no doubt in my mind.  Slow down.  No doubt in my mind.  Slow down.  Ken would have left with us that day.  No doubt in my mind. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Because that's what a boss does.  He sticks up for his people.  Stands by, Dave Dickless.  So, that's how that ends in the book.  I'm glad he acknowledged the whole Gary Wall thing in that book because the stuff we've  seen here, I mean, this is a guy who, you know, it's stated in the book, and we've said  it before, it was supposed to come in here and change this station, bring it back to former  glory in one way or another. 
[01:20:30]  And it went down the tubes.  We needed promotions.  Now, every station has a promotion staff.  Staff of people.  They look at each individual show, see what's best or right for them as far as going out,  as far as giveaways.  Just a way to promote the shows.  Promotion.  And, um...  There's motion in promotion.  Motion in promotion.  You must have promotion.  So, uh, Gary comes to us one day and goes, hey, I got the guy. 
[01:21:00]  This is the best.  This...  So, we're thinking, you know, Ope's been in radio for quite some time.  He knows a lot of promotions people.  So, I'm sure he's going through the Rolodex of great promotion people in your head.  I'm thinking...  Waiting for one of these names to spit out.  Look, I'll get real inside right now.  I'm thinking Heidi Kramer.  Oh, there you go.  I'm thinking John O'Brien.  Big names.  I'm thinking, uh, Derek down there in Miami.  People that have proven themselves in promotion.  Right.  I'm thinking Steve Morris.  Have relationships.  You need...  You know what's good for, uh, to be in promotions? 
[01:21:30]  You need relationships with companies that are as diverse as car companies to record companies.  I'm thinking...  And everything in between.  I'm thinking Mark Cronin.  Oh, wait.  Now I've gone too far.  Little joke for Rochester.  Go ahead, Anthony.  You're evil.  And, uh, so Gary says, I got this guy.  He's the best.  You need...  You need three BMWs tomorrow.  Here's your guy.  Here's your guy.  Will I...  Oh, this is great.  Part of the plan.  Coming together.  He brings in a guy who's never done radio promotions. 
[01:22:00]  He...  I believe he was a cell phone salesman.  Was he a cell phone salesman?  Yes.  Yes.  Roger, his name was.  You guys all laugh.  We still don't have a marketing guy.  We still don't.  His name was Roger, who later became known as Pop-Tart Roger.  We called him Pop-Tart Roger.  Now, why did this happen?  His first promotion idea that he had for this program.  He came in so excited. 
[01:22:30]  So excited that he set something up.  Here it is for the Opie and Anthony show.  Guys, I have a promotion for your show.  This is exactly how he talks.  Like, all right, Roger.  This is great.  It's working.  At Madison Square Garden, they are bringing to New York the world's largest Pop-Tart.  Telogs has gotten people together to make the world's largest Pop-Tart. 
[01:23:00]  And I believe I can get a booth set up for you to broadcast next to the world's giant Pop-Tart.  I look over at Opie.  We were in high.  I look over at Opie.  A trickle of blood where he's biting his lip is coming down as his head is turning red.  He's, like, fuming.  I just start laughing.  I couldn't even hold it.  And it wasn't even the world's largest Pop-Tart because it was many Pop-Tarts that made a world's largest Pop-Tart.  Which made it even dumber.  Right. 
[01:23:30]  It's not even one big fruit-filled Pop-Tart.  It's a bunch of Pop-Tarts just put together to make it look like it's the world's largest Pop-Tart.  That's a faux giant pastry.  Matter of fact, if you look up the world's largest Pop-Tart in the Guinness Book of World Records, I don't think you'll find it.  That probably ain't in there because it's a bunch of Pop-Tarts.  He's going to set up a booth.  So I start laughing, looking at him, thinking, no.  He's joking, and he's going to tell us what the real promotion is.  Like, I went, Pop-Tart.  Okay.  What?  The world's giant Pop-Tart. 
[01:24:00]  The largest Pop-Tart in the world.  You will be broadcasting from it.  So we came on the air and just ripped him apart.  That was the last promotional idea he came up with for his tenure here, which didn't last that long either.  Why would he do that?  Lasted long enough to pilfer the prize closet, I believe.  Don't forget about the window clings.  The 20,000 window clings.  So finally, wow.  Finally, wow starts taking off with our show. 
[01:24:30]  And it's a big part of the Opie and Anthony show, especially in the summer.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  You put wow in the back of your rides.  And ladies, if you see wow as you're going down the highway, you flash it.  You flash.  If you like it.  So it was a big involved thing on what was going to be the wow logo, the colors, the size of the sticker.  We were in meetings every day about these effing wow stickers.  What color should they be?  I still had font.  I still had the artwork.  Yeah.  We had hundreds of fonts to choose from.  So they'd line them up on file cabinets. 
[01:25:00]  We'd walk about 50 paces down the hall to see what it would look like on a bumper from far away.  This is this crazy ass crap that went on at this place.  It took days.  Days.  Days to decide.  A decision that should have taken, excuse me, five minutes.  Top.  So the font we picked was just a basic font.  It was nothing like the one that Opie's brother came up with that we're using now that is familiar as the wow logo.  So we picked, but the colors were similar in color because it stands out. 
[01:25:30]  It had to be a golden black.  Yeah.  Because if you know anything about advertising, golden black are the best colors to use to make your logo stand out.  Oh, yeah.  It's a known fact.  So look around.  You'll see a lot of black and gold stuff.  It gets sent out to the printers.  Now we're all excited.  We're going to finally get some kind of promotional tool.  We had a promotional tool.  Roger.  We were going to get a promotional device for this show.  The wow stickers.  Right.  They come back.  All these boxes.  Boxes upon boxes. 
[01:26:00]  We're like, oh, my God.  Finally, a commitment to this show.  They're spending some money getting stickers.  We cracked the box.  I swear to God.  It was like we were a band getting our first record deal.  We're opening up the boxes of our first CDs.  I felt like I was part of like the cartel.  And, you know, you're opening up the box and you're just seeing pure white cocaine.  Pure white cocaine.  I was just.  And what do we have?  Baby laxative.  It was awful.  But we open it up.  They weren't bumper stickers.  They were window clings.  Now, a couple of problems here. 
[01:26:30]  We never said we wanted window clings.  We never wanted window clings.  We wanted bumper stickers.  A few extra as window clings would have been fine.  But bumper stickers serve two purposes.  They go on bumpers and they go everywhere else.  Everywhere.  You don't just stick the wow sticker on bumper stickers.  I've seen them on signs.  You see them on the sides of trucks.  You see them everywhere.  Window clings go on windows for people that don't want to put stickers on their cars.  The color, completely different than the one we picked because it doesn't translate to a cling. 
[01:27:00]  It's like a color form that you put on your window.  Now, it's limited to only vehicles with back windows that aren't tinted, which I think is eight vehicles in total.  So, we just lose our effing mind again.  I forgot about the colors.  The colors were all washed out.  It was now orange and...  It wasn't even orange.  I don't know what it was.  It was weird.  It was like a lemon.  Bad.  A lemon yellow.  Couldn't see it.  They're collector's items now, though, and we have a few.  We should give them more.  We see one every once in a while in a car.  We laugh to ourselves uncontrollably.  So, we'd always turn to Roger and go, it's a window cling, you inept tool. 
[01:27:30]  So, he...  He went on to open up a, what, an audio bookstore?  Audio books.  That went out of business.  It went out of business.  Because he didn't have any audio books.  You've got to remember that also he hired those things to put the clings in.  Oh, this is ridiculous.  He ordered like 10,000 of these things.  He ordered 10,000 plastic sticker holders.  Now, you ever go into a store... 
[01:28:00]  Let's say you go in a diner.  And on top of the cigarette machine, there's all the applications for various credit cards.  And they're in those plastic holders.  That whole literature.  He ordered 10,000 of these to go in various locations around the city.  On desks, maybe it's 7-Eleven.  And your window clings will be in these 10,000 plastic things.  It was a complete waste of money.  Unbelievable.  You could have built a greenhouse. 
[01:28:30]  Radio stations do not like wasting money.  No, no, no, no.  Ever.  No, no, no, no.  I remember asking about the clings.  He's like, dude, for dudes like me, a cling is more fashionable for my BMW.  My Beamer.  I don't want to put a sticker on my car, so I put a cling in the back window.  Yeah, Roger.  All our audience is driving Beamers.  So now you've got vans, you've got box trucks, you've got tractor trailers that will never see a wow on them  because you can't put a cling on a truck. 
[01:29:00]  This is what we were dealing with.  And he was handpicked by Gary Wall.  Did you talk about the satellite dish?  We finally get good prizes.  And the pilferaging.  Yeah.  We finally get...  Now, we were looking...  We were scratching and clawing for any promotion on this show.  So we finally get these prizes.  We're giving away satellite dishes for satellite TV.  We're like, great, it's a good prize.  Any prize I would want to have myself I think is a great one. 
[01:29:30]  It's electronics.  I love it.  People want TV.  This was great.  We're going to have a giveaway.  Anyway, I never even saw one of these things in the prize closet.  They ran out of that closet so fast.  I bet you look on Gary Wall's roof, you'll see one.  And, hello, he actually got one of the employees here to carry it out to his car.  He got Eddie, right?  I'll carry it out with the garbage.  Live it live, live it live.  He grabbed it, carried it out to his car. 
[01:30:00]  Where, you know, we could have used this to bring in some listeners to then show them what we're all about.  It's a great way to hook people in.  Isn't it sure that most of the gold records went the same way and the lithographs?  Legendary rock station.  There were gold records hanging all over from bands from the 60s, 70s.  We've got to make it clear, again, here in New York, the station we broadcast from had everybody on.  The archives that they still have because they were able to lock those doors.  And I don't think anyone has the key for.  But, I mean, we had Led Zeppelin lithographs where the whole band signed. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  The Aussie stuff, Aussie gold records signed by, like, Randy Rhoades even.  I mean, just the most obscure rock and roll memorabilia.  There's not one left.  No.  Just taken.  We're all taken?  Just taken.  A Nirvana gold record signed by Kurt and the rest of the band.  Gone.  You can't get that anymore, obviously.  Everything's gone.  Everything was pilfered.  Pilfered.  This place was like a Watts liquor store during the riots. 
[01:31:00]  Gone.  Gone.  And then, of course, Beer Thursday.  No, no, no.  One other promotion.  One other major promotion.  Brilliant idea.  The Super Bowl promotion.  Oh, Jesus.  I couldn't believe that one.  You know, if those guys are listening, the party we had to go to, please call us.  Guys.  We were just talking about this the other day.  Here is a Super Bowl promotion.  You two are going to pick a winner that will win a big screen TV and Opie and Anthony as 
[01:31:30]  their guests to the Super Bowl.  Don't forget the free soda.  At the house.  Don't forget the free soda pop.  Free soda.  And a six foot hero.  Yeah, because they, you know, they thought, you know, it's not a good idea to bring, you  know, beer to a Super Bowl party.  Now, let's see how long we had been here.  July, August, September, October, November.  Five months, six months, whatever.  Five months or so.  Yeah.  Six months, maybe.  No one knew us from a hole in the wall.  We had just started getting a buzz. 
[01:32:00]  Which is strike one for any promotion.  Yeah.  We had just started getting a buzz.  But no one knew us from a hole in the wall.  You did not know who Opie and Anthony was.  We drove out to Medford, Long Island.  The people win.  Was it Medford?  They win a big screen TV that will be delivered by your favorite delivery men, Opie and Anthony,  and a six foot hero and soda that we then carted into the house.  Jim, now we're sitting.  I've been doing radio almost half of my life now, okay?  This is not a good promotion.  No.  When you do send your jocks out or your radio station out, you want to reach a lot of people. 
[01:32:30]  Now, if it was like, go to a Super Bowl party with Opie and Anthony at a place that  holds a S-load of people, good promotion, right?  You're in front of 2,000 or 3,000 people.  The game's on.  You're giving stuff away during the commercials.  It's a bar.  That makes sense.  To show up at someone's house in the middle of nowhere for 20 people, that's kind of a  stupid idea.  Here it is.  Here's a way you can find out how much fun it is and how well it works.  It's easy.  On Super Bowl Sunday this year, walk out of your house. 
[01:33:00]  Go to a neighborhood you're not familiar with, right?  Now, look in the windows, see where a Super Bowl party's going on.  Knock on the door.  Walk in.  Have fun.  There you go.  Try it yourself.  Try hanging with people you don't know from a hole in the wall who don't know you from  a hole in the wall.  Who don't know you and you're there and you figure, you know, you're not going to be a  dick about it.  And you hang.  It's a house.  It's not a bar, you know?  We walked around the Super Bowl party the whole time with people going, who are you?  Yeah, so who are you guys?  Oh, we brought the TV. 
[01:33:30]  We're L.P. and Anthony and we're on.  What?  Who?  What?  Yeah, they didn't know.  I had beer in hand the whole time.  I was by the cooler in the backyard.  Someone out there has a video of us because one guy was excited that we were there.  So he set up.  The guy that won.  Yeah, he set up video cameras in the corner and just taped us watching the game for  four great hours.  Watching TV.  So there's Ant on one corner of the couch, me on the other, no one talking to us, arms  folded, beer at our side, watching the game.  And can I interject?  Having you two show up as a prize stinks. 
[01:34:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Didn't they have colon polyps to give away?  I don't know.  I think our prize is the second worst.  Because the worst was the same day Mason and Kalinsky had to go somewhere else.  That could possibly be the worst prize.  Yeah, because I had to go to, Earl and I had to go to both of them.  And they were so far away that by the time we left the house way in Jersey with Mason  and Kalinsky to get to see you guys, you guys, the game was over.  We were done.  I was so pissed off.  Super Bell promotion.  And Gary wondered, he's like, well, why didn't you make it there on time? 
[01:34:30]  Listen, Dick, if you did the, if you had accumulated the time on it, it wasn't going to make  any sense, but not a point in that.  Oh, my God.  Have Opie and Anthony show up at your bris.  No one cared.  And I try to tell him, no, this is a great idea.  Okay, all right.  You know best.  We knew Gary was completely losing touch when he went to Beer Thursday.  Free beer.  Free beer Thursday.  We have a meeting.  He noticed, see, Gary noticed that ideas got spread around better when people would drink beer. 
[01:35:00]  You're at a bar, you're hanging out, you're drinking a few beers, you might come up with  some ideas you normally wouldn't in a more fun way.  So he thought every Thursday here at a radio station, a workplace, he'd have free beer  Thursday.  A huge tub full of ice and beer was brought into the office.  Hey, look, we're not complaining.  Trust me.  Yeah.  I like a free beer like anyone.  But the problem was that there were major things that needed to be taken care of at this 
[01:35:30]  station.  And one of them wasn't making sure.  Wasn't making sure everyone was drinking.  Drinking.  Drinking during the day.  Right.  And everyone would get hammered.  It only lasted one Thursday.  And creativity wouldn't come out.  Animosity came out.  Anger came out.  Oh, yeah.  Fist fights almost.  It was ridiculous because it was people, he was like, hey, it's going to be great.  We'll all drink.  We'll trade ideas.  It'll be fun.  No, we all drank and realized what an a-hole this guy was and how little he knew about  what to do here and just started screaming.  So that lasted one week until I think a memo came down from Infinity Broadcasting. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, way up top.  And said, are you kidding me?  A memo from the man himself.  I don't even think it was stop.  I think it was something like, obviously this is a joke because no one would really do this.  But if there's any idea to really do something like this, don't do it.  Who was the one responsible for getting the beer for free beer Thursday?  They sent Ro and I out with the van.  Go get a ton of beer.  Go get a ton of beer.  And you couldn't just go to a deli.  So you had to go all the way to some grocery store and buy all this beer. 
[01:36:30]  And the other thing was...  Free beer Thursday.  I know a lot of people are sitting there going, well, that sounds really cool.  Yes, it does.  But we needed to take care of some serious issues around here.  It started at 4 o'clock.  People were bombed by 4 o'clock.  There were people around here that probably hadn't drank in about 10 years that were just  hammered walking around.  And Gary's like, this is great.  You know, him and Roger thought it was a brilliant promotion.  Until the next day.  So when he finally went, you know, we got the management that's in there now, thank God. 
[01:37:00]  And the rest is a history.  There you go.  It's in a book now, though.  There you go.  Some of the stuff.  Some of the stuff.  He's...  Yeah, he's...  He left out a lot of great stuff.  Yeah, he left out some good, fun stuff.  I guess he didn't want to touch on NEW after he left, you know, which is why he didn't  really get into the whole thing about us.  But, you know, whatever.  I don't want to be hoo-hoo-hoo, but we really need to write a book.  Because we got some stories to tell, my friend. 
[01:37:30]  Anyway.  All right, let's move on.  Sure.  You know what Rick is finding right now?  What?  The on-air fight we had.  Oh, with Carol.  With Carol, one of the legendary rock jocks at this station.  Yeah.  It's definitely worth a listen.  He's trying to find it, and he's getting some excerpts from that.  And we'll move on to other things, finally.  All right.  Like Craig here.  And find a new foosball table.  No.  I've given him, Al Dukes from Rana Fez Show, a week. 
[01:38:00]  That was Wednesday.  To get my foosball table replaced that he broke.  And no.  I don't have one.  There will be consequences.  That's all I'll say.  Has there been any progress in the foosball search?  He researched it, picked out one, presented it to us.  It was acceptable.  And now he has to acquire it and bring it there by Showtime Tuesday.  That'll be a week.  Or there will be consequences that he has no idea what they are.  But there will be consequences.  I hope the consequence is that you just punch him in the middle of his forehead. 
[01:38:30]  That could be it.  I'm leaving it wide open right now.  Wide open.  All right.  Hi, man.  More of your phone calls on the way.  We haven't talked to you guys yet today, really.  If you're not in the New York area, there's a few lines open.  866-277-4WOW.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot.  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:39:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We just cleared the phone line.  So if we hung up on you, don't get insulted.  We're just trying to move the show along, all right?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, we can't be polite all the time.  So don't take it personally.  We get a lot of emails from people going, hey, Stinky hung up on me, man.  And I'm pissed.  Just understand, it's part of the show.  Sometimes we've got to clear the lines and try to move on, all right?  Oh, by the way, my new prediction for war, Wednesday. 
[01:39:30]  By Wednesday.  Between now and Wednesday, I think we will do something.  Some type of military action.  Overt.  We will see it.  Oh, that'll be nice.  Yeah.  Want to see something at this point.  All right.  Well, the phone lines are wide open because we just hung up on everyone.  So in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  And anywhere else, 866-2774.  844, wow. 
[01:40:00]  A lot of people asking us what we thought of SNL.  We thought that was pretty cool.  Some good skits.  Oh, yeah.  I think they did the right thing.  They had a couple little jokes about Osama bin Laden and things like that.  I thought they did a fine job.  I thought the mayor did a good job at the beginning of the show.  Rudy came out with the firemen, the cops, and Paul Simon sang a tune.  Sang the boxer.  Yeah.  And I thought that was pretty cool.  That was cool, yeah.  Another great Jeopardy skit.  That's their best bet. 
[01:40:30]  That Jeopardy thing.  Oh, sorry, Jim.  Go ahead.  That's all right.  No, my friend, Dean Edwards, just got hired.  He played Chris Tucker, and he's very funny.  On the Jeopardy skit.  Yeah, that guy was a new guy.  Yeah, he just got out.  He did a great Chris Tucker, man.  Wow.  Yeah, he's funny.  Really funny.  He was definitely all right, man.  So, yeah, we thought it was good, you know?  Yeah, though, Sean Connery.  And our buddy Frank Caliendo on MADtv doing Robin Williams.  Woo!  Oh, damn, I missed MADtv.  To a T.  Really? 
[01:41:00]  Props go out to our bud Frank Caliendo.  Did a great job.  You got to check him out on MADtv.  Yeah, I'll get a tape of that.  Will it be on?  Do you know if it'll be on?  Is MADtv on Tuesday nights?  I don't know, because I'm doing...  No, Jim.  Everyone knows MADtv's on Saturday.  Why would you say something so stupid?  I didn't know.  I just want to make sure that I won't miss it being at Rascals tomorrow night with Rich Voss and Jeff Norris.  You whore!  You whore!  No, we just...  I have to plug.  We had just rescheduled this gig. 
[01:41:30]  It was canceled, obviously, the 11th when the Planet of the Apes attacked this great city.  So I am now switching it.  It was turned to...  Do you have any shame?  A lot of it, yes.  That's why I'm in this business.  All right, that's good.  Bobby Bigrigger.  Bobby!  Hey!  Hey, O&A and the plug whore.  How are we doing today?  All right.  Did you guys have to see who is the new weakest link?  No, I've heard people have been saying this now.  Jay Moore was on the weakest link?  The first one bumped off last night.  He was the first one that was the weakest link? 
[01:42:00]  Does anyone have audio?  I wanted to tape it, but I didn't get a chance.  How the hell do we not know about this?  Our gang, Stinky and Ben and Rick, felt it wasn't important enough to tape the weakest link with our buddy Jay Moore.  That's an hour of goofing if you have to tape.  Oh, my God.  And I hear he said something.  I'm sure he'll be calling in to try and defend himself.  All right, Bobby, help us out.  So what happened?  Jay, he was the first one voted off.  Yeah, the first round, he blew it.  Hey, she gave him a question that, hell, Anthony, you had a hard time with it, but the answer was sneezing. 
[01:42:30]  Was what?  Sneezing.  It was like a medical terminology for sneezing.  Yeah.  And he had no idea.  He asked him to repeat the question, made him look like more of an idiot.  But he wasn't actually the weakest link the first round.  This other girl was, and I guess because he blew so much time, everybody just pointed the fingers at him.  Oh, because he took up too much time not knowing the answer.  Yeah, you can't do that on the weakest link?  Yeah, it was. 
[01:43:00]  The weakest link?  I was waiting for a plug, but never heard it.  The weakest link is the stupidest show on TV.  Yeah, it's really lame.  How is it doing in the ratings?  Oh, I know.  I just got to be flipping around.  There's no logic to why they vote people off.  It's just so stupid.  Yeah, especially in the beginning.  And the whole voting off thing.  Enough with voting off.  Does every show have to have a voting off feature?  I'm so sick of the voting off feature.  I'm not voting off.  Let me let you guys go.  I'm down the highway here.  I got to make sure I don't take somebody out later. 
[01:43:30]  Wouldn't this show make more sense if the person that answered the least amount of questions just loses?  So then there's extra pressure, like, oh, my God.  No, no, because it's a whole thing.  Someone might answer more questions, but be a bigger a-hole in the other people's eyes.  The British whore.  After hanging out.  The British whore, yeah, can make fun of them.  After hanging out with them for three minutes, people know that.  Right.  Of course they do.  Uh-huh.  I like the voting off, like when the tribal council, you think they're together.  Oh, that's great, isn't it?  Ugh.  I like Submission Hill, mate. 
[01:44:00]  No, uh, uh.  Submission, uh, was that it?  No, which was the one from, uh, boot camp?  Submission from boot camp?  Boot camp.  Elimination Hill?  I never saw it.  Anal Hill?  I don't know what it was.  I'm so tired.  There's always something here at Campfire.  Real TV would be interesting if they showed in a prison and, like, at the end of it, one  guy gets to get out before his sentence is up or something.  Ah, see, real deal.  That would be interesting.  That you'd watch.  They don't even do real TV the right way.  No.  I was a pretty big fan of Big Brother 2, but they had a lot of, you know, controversy on 
[01:44:30]  that show that they didn't take advantage of.  I cannot even stomach anything like Big Brother 2.  And a guy with a knife at a girl's throat and they kick him out of the house.  Like, oh my God, we can't, whoa, whoa, whoa.  We can't do it.  And that was lame.  Was that before or after sex?  It was, uh, before.  Yeah.  Well, the couple that was in, they were, who were they?  The people that came in from Big Brother 2?  Ah, yeah, yeah.  They were, like, a really nice couple and you could just see they'd be fun to be around.  You know, like anybody else in Los Angeles.  Ah, Bill, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I saw Jay last night. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  They were, you know, they always ask you why you voted people off and they asked, well,  was one woman why she voted Jay off?  Yeah.  She said that she used to date him, I guess, and he didn't call her a couple years ago.  And that's one of the reasons she voted him off.  And, uh, I forget the woman's name, but she's going to be marrying George Stephanopoulos.  Really?  She made a big deal out of that.  And as Jay walked off, he looked at it, he goes, George Stephanopoulos, huh?  And then it cuts.  And everybody was cracking up, but you didn't hear what he said.  Whatever he threw at her, they didn't air. 
[01:45:30]  Well, where's Jay?  We got to, we got to find out what he said.  You got to find out what the crack was, because he threw something at her, but they didn't  air, because it was, like, a bad cut.  Everybody was laughing, but...  We'll get him on the show and we'll talk about Weakest Lake and stuff.  It says Jay got voted off by some chick he banged and never called again.  She's now marrying Stephanopoulos.  I mean, she wasn't the only one, but that was the one she told the story.  It was real uncomfortable.  You guys would have loved it.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, we'll get to the bottom of that.  Okay.  Are you going to the Jay Moore benefit?  Sure.  Sunday, I believe, with Stephen Lynch and Mike DiNicola at the Beacon.  Tickets on sale now. 
[01:46:00]  We're all heading down there.  Jay Moore and Stephen Lynch, that sounds cool.  It's for a great cause.  All right.  I believe this one's for the firefighters.  We're going to be doing so many of these in the coming, well, I would say years at this  point, so...  Cool.  All right, Bill, thank you.  Thank you, David.  Can you imagine having been the spokesman for the White House and knowing that your future  wife banged the guy who fired Tom Cruise and Jerry Maguire?  That's got to really fuck you.  Yeah, that was just on this weekend.  So a little Jay on that.  On what?  On Fox.  Jerry Maguire.  Jesus, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys? 
[01:46:30]  Man, I went to the movies this weekend to see that ridiculous don't say a word, bro.  They cut out the Twin Towers, man.  Don't say a word.  Don't say a word.  Don't even say a word about this.  I'll never tell.  It's ridiculous, the movie, bro.  And even in freaking Zoolander.  Hold on.  It's getting good reviews, that movie.  The movie sucked, bro.  It's ridiculous, man.  What you see in the movies is what...  Hey, I'm going to go out on a limb, and I bet you she tells by the end of the movie.  Don't tell us, though.  Oh, damn, man. 
[01:47:00]  Don't tell us, because I need to find out for myself.  But I think she tells.  Oh, man, bro.  Just avoid Zoolander, bro.  At all costs, man.  Even in Zoolander, they cut out the effing buildings.  Yeah.  They cut out everything, bro.  You couldn't even see the Empire State Building.  They even cut that out.  Jesus, I heard Zoolander was quite funny.  Zoolander was funny.  It was stupid funny.  Yeah, it was stupid funny.  It was better than don't say a word.  Don't say a word is getting pretty good reviews, though.  Yeah, it's all right, man. 
[01:47:30]  It's a pass, though.  You can pass on it.  But the point is that they're just cutting out the buildings from every freaking thing.  Oh, yeah.  Even the Spider-Man trailer.  What's the deal with that?  You know, I think they need to keep the Twin Towers in all these movies.  Yeah, they should.  Especially the ones that aren't out yet.  I mean, you know.  They should.  There's no point in taking out the freaking movie.  They were there when they filmed it.  Why not just leave it in there?  We can handle it.  Yeah.  As citizens.  I think we can, too.  And it's just another one of those things where it proves you're not getting to us.  It's just Hollywood thinking for everybody else again. 
[01:48:00]  And, by the way, don't say a word of film or what Voss used to say to his stepson.  It would have been funnier if I didn't mumble it out.  His stepson.  Be quick.  Be funny.  I stink.  At least I'm not the only one blowing easy jokes.  God, I really trip on that little loser with one second of air time.  Creep.  All right, later, guys.  What are the six numbers?  I want to play them.  Yeah, right.  Let's go to Greg.  Greg, what's up?  You're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, how you doing?  I just want to add one thing to the weakest link because I saw that Jay was going to be on 
[01:48:30]  and I don't normally watch game shows.  So, when they were like, okay, now tell us who you are and where you're from,  Jay actually says, I'm Jay Moore, and he starts giving out his address.  What?  Yeah, it was like 609-something or whatever, and they bleeped it out.  It was probably a goof.  No, but they bleeped it out, so it must have been...  You know, he might have gave a fake address there.  Yeah.  Well, I guess they didn't want to take any chances, but they bleeped it out anyway. 
[01:49:00]  But then again, there was a time that Dice was on the show and gave out a cell phone number  and ended up taking calls for like a week straight from our listeners.  So, I guess it is possible.  Jay was like the second one that they asked, you know, in a row,  because it was like ten guys, ten people that they had to ask.  And I guess he didn't get the gist of, just give your town and state.  Yeah.  He got a little too detailed there.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Now, Al is saying that, don't say a word, did have the World Trade Center in.  Al?  Yep.  Yes.  Yeah, at the end of the movie, they had a whole panoramic view of the city, 
[01:49:30]  and you saw the World Trade Center in the Empire State Building.  I don't know what the guy was talking about.  Yeah.  He probably left before it was over.  He hated it.  Now, Al, did you like...  That's true.  Did you like the movie?  It was all right.  You know, you could have waited a video for that one.  Really?  I never really, really liked Michael Douglas, so...  Yeah, Michael Douglas plays the...  I'm sorry, Jim, I know what you're going to say,  but he plays the same exact character in every movie.  That's true.  He has the same hair, same tone, same everything.  Yeah.  Yep.  He's like...  Except in Falling Down. 
[01:50:00]  Falling Down.  You're right.  That was the movie that he completely changed his whole look and his whole demeanor.  Yes, you're right.  And that was a great movie, Falling Down.  I liked when he did the voice of Paulie.  All right, Al.  All right, thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  You know what they cut out of...  They were playing The Craft over the weekend.  You know, the one with the witches and chicks.  You know that movie The Craft?  Neve Campbell?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Feruza Balk.  With that goddamn wood chipper mouth that you...  And they cut out a reference where she's supposed to have killed another girl's 
[01:50:30]  parents in a plane crash.  And they cut out any reference.  She goes, well, just turn on the news.  You'll find out where your parents went.  And she's supposed to turn the TV on and see a report about a plane crash.  And then later on, they go, oh, that whole plane crash thing.  And you see her say plane crash, but they edit the words out.  We can't start doing that.  I can understand some things, maybe, but, you know, every plane crash reference now 
[01:51:00]  is going to be cut out.  Are they going to cut the reference in Meet the Parents where Ben Stiller loses it at  the airport?  I don't know.  Maybe.  When he's on the plane?  Guys, I've got to be honest.  Hollywood knows what's best for me.  Yeah, you're right, Norton.  Hollywood knows.  This is the type of things we shouldn't be doing because then you're telling the  tourists, yeah, you got us.  Look at us.  See what we're doing?  Completely adjusting.  We're altering things.  How we look at, you know, our entertainment.  Shouldn't do it.  Thank you, Laura. 
[01:51:30]  Dismissal Hill was...  Although it was nice to watch Back to the Future and see that they still have the Libyan  terrorists in there killing Doc Brown.  Frank Caliendo.  Hey.  Hey.  How are you?  Thank you.  You heard us talking about you.  Yeah, I did.  Thank you so much.  I'm in Cleveland right now.  Oh, look at you.  Checking out the show on Extreme Radio.  Yes, 92.3.  And no, we aren't on Tuesdays, Norton.  I was only making sure because I didn't want to miss it tomorrow.  No, no, no. 
[01:52:00]  We are not on Tuesdays while you're at Rascals.  Yeah, that's his clever way to get his plug out there.  Oh, yeah, I know.  And let me tell you this.  I won't actually be on next week because they're doing a strike episode, but I will be  at Bananas in Poughkeepsie on Friday the 12th and on the 13th.  Oh, no, the whore!  In 13th and Hasbro Heights, I'm pulling a Norton.  I do impressions.  Hey, Frank, the other night I was watching Mad TV, were you doing De Niro or Pacino?  I was doing Pacino and, uh, is that Voss?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Can you tell by the slurred S's?  I was doing Pacino and, uh, Will Sasso was doing, uh, De Niro.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah, Robin Williams on Mad TV this weekend was great, Frank.  Thank you very much.  Right the F on, man.  It was, uh, it was a lot of fun.  I didn't know Voss was there.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have called in.  That's right.  Taking his valuable air time away from him.  Nah.  All right, Frank.  So, we'll see you at Bananas, I guess.  Yeah, that'd be great.  And, uh, I really was listening to you guys, but only for a little bit. 
[01:53:00]  Now, it sounds like I wasn't because I didn't know Voss was there.  But here's a guy who just screwed up.  I heard a little bit.  I just, I know I feel like you guys think I'm lying, which I was slightly, because I just  realized that you guys were on here, so.  Yeah.  Hey, John Madden, Jets going to win tonight or what?  Hey, the Jets are, uh, hey, who are they playing?  Uh, the Niners.  Hey, the Niners are older, because they're from the Niners, 49ers.  It's short for 49ers, and the Jets are, uh, Jetliners, and they're probably going to have 
[01:53:30]  to change the name of that, because you can't have Jets anywhere now.  Oh.  Makes perfect sense.  Yeah, that's a good point.  That was a callback to what you said earlier.  Yeah, I like that.  I like that.  No win is almost a neat test.  I like when you comedians use the callback.  Yeah, I'll probably try and do that when I'm, uh, in Poughkeepsie and Hasbrook Heights  next week.  Yeah, it's a nice, it's a nice, uh, comedy tool you guys all have.  Callback.  Callback.  Love the callback.  Nice way to close a set, I might add, when doing seven on television.  Well, thank you very much.  Well, you guys have fun, and, uh, thank you for, uh, letting me on. 
[01:54:00]  All right, see you soon, Frank.  All right, guys, thanks.  All right, there he goes, Frank Caliendo.  He's a funny dude.  He's the nicest guy.  Hey, you see they pull, uh, pulled siphon filter?  They're in the midst of pulling siphon filter.  Which one?  Game?  The latest one?  I guess the latest one.  Or the next one.  Washington, D.C. is threatened by a deployment of a biological weapon capable of killing millions?  That would be the first one, I guess.  Yeah, well, I guess they're pulling them.  Yeah, yeah.  Gabe Logan is the country's only chance to infiltrate the terrorist operation and ensure  the deadly siphon filter virus doesn't contaminate the public. 
[01:54:30]  Logan!  How about that?  Yeah, that's the original one.  That's definitely an impression for all you gamers out there, Drake.  Logan!  That was a great game, too.  The first siphon filter.  I'm sure everybody that's wanted it has played it already, so.  It's old.  But it's just another thing.  They're pulling all that.  Like I said, I tried to get Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 off.  They're not putting it out.  Well, we have to be protected, don't you know? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, but you know something?  I don't think Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 would make a difference.  You know?  I do think that they were able to fly real planes.  You know?  I think you should leave our entertainment alone.  Instead of changing the entertainment, how about booting certain animals out of the country?  I like that one.  That would be a nice start.  When's that game coming out?  We have to boot animals out of this country.  Goodbye.  But we don't know where these animals are.  Yes, we do.  They're in this country. 
[01:55:30]  Go down to McDougal.  You know something?  You ever buy cigarettes?  I'll handpick them.  I'll handpick them.  I'm sure we could bet a squad to just point them out.  And we'll be 99% accurate.  And for the 1%, sorry.  Yeah, they're fitting in now, trying to fit in diner hair blonde and taking baths and stuff.  All that stuff like bathing?  Yeah.  Wow, that is a commitment.  Taping back their foreskin.  Look, I'm Jewish.  How would you know that?  Hey, Peter, what's up?  What's up, O&A? 
[01:56:00]  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to call and let you guys know.  I was at the Giant game yesterday.  Yeah, big win for the Giants.  Yeah, they came through.  I hate the Giants.  There you go.  And, you know, I was in section 323.  And, like, a plane flew directly above.  Hey.  Hey, watch that big S-word.  Hey, buckaroo.  Hey.  We have to dump him out of the S-word and plane.  You can't say plane.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a plane.  All right, sir.  A lot of people freaked out because a plane went overhead. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, it, like, buzzed the stadium.  And I called home to find out if anyone talked about it during the game.  And they didn't even mention it.  But, you know, our whole section flipped out because we were up top.  I don't blame you.  And it was the only, and we heard on the radio they weren't allowing Jets over.  Ah, so it was like, here it is.  Oh, yeah.  It was really intense, so.  All right, Peter.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Hope, aren't you a Mets fan?  Uh, yes.  Aren't you nuts over?  I'm freaking.  I'm losing it.  I was losing my mind.  I'm losing it big time.  Two games out. 
[01:57:00]  Two.  Oh.  They could, no, they would be tied for first right now.  I know if they want, yeah.  I didn't know what happened to that other game, the one, um, the other night.  They were, they were ahead.  They were doing well.  Yeah.  What happened?  Shut up.  Uh, let's, can we take a break?  What was it, Benitez?  Yeah.  It was great.  Son of a bitch.  It was great just watching him self-destruct, dude.  He is the biggest loser.  He's the worst.  I, I've been saying that for over a year now.  God damn it.  In a pressure situation, he stinks.  He's bad.  How did, five to one, they're winning in the ninth. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  It's a given.  He gave it up.  What a piece of crap, Benitez is.  Oh, God, that is sad.  It's destiny, my friends.  Mets, all the way.  They should hire Andy Hawkins as their closer.  At least he would be fun to watch.  Or old Jim Abbott.  No hitter, one arm.  Nothing wrong with the one-arm picture.  Oh, yeah.  Gotta love that.  Nothing wrong with the slot machine. 
[01:58:00]  That was really uncalled for.  We finally got, we finally got to use that line.  Oh, God.  That's right.  Just different reference.  There you go.  There you go.  See how clever we could be?  Don't.  We saved that line for many months.  Rick, do we have the fight ready to go?  Well, I got tons of funny clips, dude.  Do you really?  Oh, seriously.  Seriously.  What are we playing next?  The huge fight we had?  The fight with Carol Miller, yeah. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  And just, you know, her babbling, her stupid analogies.  Okay.  Just, yeah.  It's hilarious.  That's great.  This is some really, really good stuff.  Especially because part of it happened off the air while we were in commercials.  And, like, we just threw down something to record it on.  And it sounds kind of crappy, but it still comes out clear as day.  It's really funny.  All right, cool.  We'll get to that next.  Oh, can I announce my new idea?  Your new idea?  We were talking about the Michael Douglas movie.  Oh, I thought your new idea was that everyone should go out and look at the leaves change colors. 
[01:59:00]  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I did not.  What?  That's not why I got out of town.  I thought that's why you went.  No.  I thought that's why you couldn't go to the roast, the Hugh Hefner roast.  With Playboy bunnies walking around wearing nothing and celebrities, a black tie event.  Because you had to go up to, I believe it was Vermont, to look at leaves change.  New Hampshire to look at leaves change.  I was in New Hampshire and the leaves are not really changing. 
[01:59:30]  Did you bring a little scrapbook to put one in?  You got to press them flat.  Fine.  Now I'm not telling you my idea.  Well, no.  I just thought that might have been it.  I got away.  I was able to actually try to work on our little show that you and I do.  I had a clear head.  And I think I came up with a really great contest that jocks from all over the country could steal.  Did you go driving?  Just drive around with no destination up there. 
[02:00:00]  I drove on the Kankamangus Highway.  The Kankamangus Highway.  And this is a highway that really you wouldn't take to get from a point A to a point B.  I drove on the Kanker Soar Highway.  Right.  And was this for the purpose of looking at foliage?  The purpose was to get to North Conway where I was staying Saturday night.  What was there?  A condo. 
[02:00:30]  A condo.  But it's not ski season.  Well, you could still ride the lifts, sure, if you feel like it.  And what would you do if you get up there?  To get some fresh air.  Fresh air and a view of?  Mountains, if you feel like it.  It's the foliage of Madison County.  It's called foliage.  And did you have a little sweater on, did you?  A little fall sweater?  I had my new fleece.  Dude, you went off to look at the leaf. 
[02:01:00]  It was a little chilly?  No, I did.  I pet some wolves.  You pet wolves?  Yeah.  Where?  At a reserve.  Where, like, wolves go when people don't want them.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  There was 14 pens with over 100 wolves.  I was petting wolves.  How the hell did you find out about this?  When I was up there, you kind of, you know.  So you didn't go there with the purpose of petting wolves?  You go up there, you get the little book, and you figure out what you want to do.  Did the foliage guy tell you?  Do you have this book? 
[02:01:30]  No, I don't.  You didn't bring this book with some other?  I want to see what else is in there, man.  It was either that or hot air ballooning.  Give me a break.  Well, that's kind of cool and dangerous.  I went horseback riding.  Is that good?  Oh, we're falling.  We're falling.  We're still falling.  Still falling in the hot air balloon.  Falling?  Still falling.  That's how you crash in those things.  Oh.  Takes a while.  But then you always wind up hitting those power lights.  That's about it.  You went horseback riding?  Horseback riding.  All right.  That's cool.  I got really drunk at North Conway Saturday night. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  I climbed down a mountain, took a ski lift off.  Did you get to feed the horse some oats?  Some oats?  Sugar cube.  Hold it flat.  Hold it flat.  Right, though, yes.  Hold it flat.  All right.  Let me go to Ron here.  Ron, what's up?  Yeah, they call people who go up there and look at me.  It's peepers.  Peepers?  Peepers.  I hope these new nicknames should be peepers.  I wasn't.  Peepers, creepers.  Peeping, okay?  If I was really into checking out the foliage, I would know that this coming weekend would 
[02:02:30]  be the peak season.  Oh.  Okay, peepers.  Whatever you say, peepers.  The peak time.  Peepers.  Peepers.  Peepers.  Yeah, you guys laugh all you want, but I came up with a great idea.  All right.  What is it?  During my time in the mountains.  Does it involve a rake?  Oh, leaves stink. 
[02:03:00]  The only good things about leaves is they burn really easily.  They're awful.  Couldn't even start a fire because the condo goes to gas fireplaces now.  Gas.  Oh, you can't bring the logs in.  That's the best thing about going way away in mountains and stuff.  You build your little fire.  Sure.  Bring a young lady up.  You build a fire.  I don't know if you can say that.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's take a break. 
[02:03:30]  We'll play the Carol Miller fight next.  I'll get abused some more, and maybe I'll let you in on my little idea.  All right.  Maybe.  Bastards.  Opie.  Thumb the Sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the A-hole over there.  You C-sucking F.  Cool jack-off ass F.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, that's funny.  Hey, are you down with the sickness?  Oh, look at me being clever on this Rocktober first. 
[02:04:00]  Rocktober.  I hope you're down with the sickness.  They call Opie and Anthony.  Oh, hey.  Hey, Anthony on line 11, that makes a good, well, I'm sure he's going to make a good point.  Hey, Anthony.  Yo, Anthony, Opie, what's up?  What up?  What's your question?  Now, listen.  The State Department, I think, has got something on Opie.  They're saying that he touched a Muslim relic, like whiskers or something, and he might have 
[02:04:30]  started this whole thing off.  Yeah, that's true.  Opie did touch Muhammad's beard when he was in Turkey.  No, I didn't touch.  You couldn't touch.  Well, you looked at it.  I just said, well, you mocked it.  I did say, what was the big deal in front of a room full of Shiite Muslims?  You mocked it.  I did not curse.  That's the extreme Muslim.  That's what I'm hearing.  What happens now?  The trees and the wolves turn on us?  Anthony, would you ask the goddamn question that you're up on the goddamn screen for? 
[02:05:00]  All right.  Who does Opie like tonight?  Thank you.  Who does he like tonight?  The Jets, 49ers.  Because whoever he bets, I'm going to go against him because he's a mush.  Right.  Whatever Opie, whoever Opie picks for tonight's game, please bet the opposite.  He's a mush.  Well, they're talking about the sports curse.  And people try to trick me with the sports curse, and they go, please, please root for  the Niners.  But it's got to come from the heart.  Of course I want the Jets tonight.  Take the Niners. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  Take the Niners, man.  You heard it here.  Take the Niners.  It's a guaranteed win.  All right.  One thing I've got to say, it has nothing to do with football, but in a time like this,  where, you know, the Twin Towers falling and everything, I really miss Spaz.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Oh, man.  Well, sorry.  Don't know any such name.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Okay.  Thank you.  There you go.  Let me go to Frank.  Frank, what's going on?  Opie, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I was wondering if you might have a picture of you as the Pumpkin King to commemorate this 
[02:06:00]  year's trip into the woods.  Well, we'd be looking forward to you telling us about pumpkin picking this year.  I did not.  You know, the past couple of years.  I did not.  Any wagons involved?  I did not go pumpkin picking.  I did not.  I think I took care of that by petting the wolves.  I think I'm okay now this year.  You're not going to have to go out east along Long Island with the little wagon?  No, I don't think so.  And pick pumpkins?  I think I'm safe for a while.  I think Sandy is going to want to do that.  I don't think so. 
[02:06:30]  Because us trying to stake out a moose for 20 minutes, I think took...  What?  What did you do?  What did you do?  So you're not being open here with us.  What did you do?  All right, Frank.  Did you and Sandy have a contest who could find the biggest leaf?  We didn't.  We really did not peep.  It's too early.  We weren't peeping.  Did you make little piles of leaves?  It was just nice to get the F out of the city.  Get my head back together.  Did you paint your own leaves?  It's been a nightmare the last three weeks. 
[02:07:00]  Using your hand as a...  I didn't paint leaves.  And I bet one of them said,  Honey, it's time to leave.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  None of that went on.  I went horseback riding.  And I got my horse to gallop a little bit.  I'll never leave you.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Where the F did those pictures come from?  Oh, look at that.  It was Opie.  Ha ha ha ha.  Wait.  Why?  There's some pictures of Opie when he was picking pumpkins last year, I believe.  You can see Opie and the pumpkins on opieandanthony.com. 
[02:07:30]  Go to Wall of Fame and go back a couple of years.  Opie the pumpkin.  Yeah.  A couple of years.  Yeah.  Well.  It's in the Wall of Fame?  Yeah.  All right.  Awesome.  Yeah, that was the day it was a big, huge Mets playoff game and Opie went pumpkin picking.  Yeah.  Go back to 1999.  It's embarrassing photo.  Opie the pumpkin king.  Honey, let's go to the store and buy a Leaf Garage CD.  Ha ha ha ha ha. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, man.  Annoying Laugh Man, what's up?  Opie, did you have a little leaf over your private areas?  At nighttime?  Well, you're always funny, you know?  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Stick to driving, annoying Laugh Anthony.  Stick to driving cars, my friend.  Maybe you'll slide in some leaves.  Ha ha ha ha.  Can we move on with my great idea?  Okay.  I just wanted to know, uh, about the moose.  Something did come out of my weekend up in the mountains. 
[02:08:30]  What about the moose, though?  Well, you know, we staked out a little area hoping a moose would show up.  Forget the moose.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Forget the moose.  You must have hated that moose.  We found out where, uh, people go to, uh, to observe, uh, meeses in their natural habitat.  Moosen!  In the wood, is it?  They're meeson.  So, you, you, uh, like, found an area.  I hear they come out every dusk. 
[02:09:00]  You hunker down.  And how long do you sit before you say, I don't think a moose is coming?  How long?  You know, when you're in the middle of the mountains and breathing in the fresh air and there's no noises around you,  your time seems to stand still.  The only time I will stake out an animal like that is if I'm starving and must kill it for food.  That is it.  I mean, so you, you, you stake down an area and waited.  Yeah.  You gotta let me know how long this, it's very important to know how long you waited. 
[02:09:30]  20 to 30 minutes.  20 to 30 minutes.  Then you got the idiot drive-by tourists that have to stop and do moose calls and stuff.  Yeah, they're a bunch of idiots.  They were pissing me off.  Guys, it's Roger.  Hello?  Opie, would you like to broadcast in front of the world's biggest leaf?  It's going to be at Madison Square Garden.  But it's not one leaf.  It's a bunch of leaves in the shape of one big leaf. 
[02:10:00]  Like the Pop-Tot.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I was just wondering, why does Opie's vacation sound like a tampon commercial?  We need to go horseback riding.  You can go swimming.  You can go to the beach.  A tampon commercial.  Nice.  Oh, wow.  Hey, man.  Joe, that hurts.  You don't know me well enough to say those type of things.  Tell the girls from Philadelphia.  They've got to give us the whole WOW program.  I drive every day on I-95. 
[02:10:30]  They'll catch on.  Give it time, my friend.  All right, Thomas.  You guys suck.  All right, bye.  Glenn the Tool wants to know, Opie, if you had a nice hayride.  And did you get some apple cider?  Sure, I had a little cider.  You had some cider?  Did you put a cinnamon stick in there, did you?  Was it from the Dickens Orchard?  Dickens cider?  Dickens cider?  Dickens cider.  Dickens cider.  It's from the Dickens Orchard up there. 
[02:11:00]  That is a real cider joint, yes.  Yes.  You ever see that?  The cider orchard and plant that's up there?  Dickens Farm?  No.  It's Dickens Cider.  I didn't.  It's great.  It's a real place.  Nothing better than Dickens Cider.  Have a nice caramel apple.  Wonderful.  Well, I like the warm ciders.  Yeah.  Don't forget the caramel apple and the little wet naps to take the sticky off the lips.  I didn't do that. 
[02:11:30]  You guys suck, man.  Are you tapping trees for syrup?  No.  No?  Nothing like that?  Nothing like that.  That's why you're up there in the mountains.  Nothing like that.  Looking at the sky.  Did you and Sandy lay on your backs for hours, pointing out the clouds and what shapes they  were making?  No.  No?  Or at night, just say how mind-boggling it is that there are so many stars.  You know, there's nothing I can say, but to check out the stars in the middle of the 
[02:12:00]  mountains of New Hampshire is pretty damn cool because there's no lights around.  Yeah, so is cruising Christopher Street.  For you, maybe.  I know.  I know the struggle.  Ah, that's great.  All right.  Ah, your idea.  That was it.  Not telling you now.  Well, oh, stop.  You went up there to open your mind and to get away.  All right.  Crap.  Well, you got an idea now.  Is it depending on you?  I also, you know, I know the abuse is fun and I'll stay in the barrel as long as it 
[02:12:30]  takes.  I don't care, but I was listening to Boston Radio.  Yeah.  Man, our station, our old station, I should say, they just have a bunch of pussy DJs on  the air now.  Oh, yeah.  Someone actually got through to talk about you and I.  Oh, really?  And they blew it off and said, oh, we can't talk about those guys.  Oh, bye.  Here's Smooth Criminal.  We can't do that.  Hey.  It's against the rules. 
[02:13:00]  We can't do that.  I'll get fired that you even got through.  Yeah.  And this part of the call got on the air.  They're all petrified.  A bunch of pussies at our old radio station.  We're walking all over them and their orders were to not talk about us at all.  Dave Dickless told them, don't talk about us.  And they're all obeying Dave Dickless.  That's a great way to get ahead in this line of work is to listen, listen to those guys.  You stupid idiots.  Hey, Dave.  Somebody earlier was pointing out a great fake Rocco bit. 
[02:13:30]  Now that we've been pointing them out, people are remembering other ones and thinking, oh, my God.  Yeah, that was a fake one, too.  This is the guy that slid into our seat after we got fired from Boston.  Real douchebag.  Rocco!  So one of his bits this guy was pointing out was that he gets one of his cronies to call in and say how they're offended by his show.  Because it's all set up.  And then Rocco goes off on this whole berating the guy, you know, just one after another, quick one-liner things. 
[02:14:00]  And he goes, this from a guy that can't string a sentence together live on the air.  But it's all written and prescripted.  So when he blurts it out, he's really getting the guy and nailing him.  And, of course, the guy is being quiet during the time where Schlocko's getting his insults in.  Because that's what it says.  Be quiet during these parts.  One more fake radio, sure.  Yeah.  Hey, Dave!  Look, just some advice to our old station and the jocks that are on there now.  Will you...  Trust me. 
[02:14:30]  We don't need the publicity.  Fight back, you pussies.  We're going to completely destroy you.  We're going to completely destroy our old station.  But at least go out fighting.  You're going to act like a man!  Don't listen to Dave Dickless and keep your little lips shut.  We are going to destroy you.  We're going to walk all over you.  We have started the process already.  Be a man.  And be a woman, whoever the hell you are over there.  And freaking fight back.  So you go out fighting.  Go out like a man.  And leave fighting. 
[02:15:00]  We're walking all over you.  And your boss tells you to, you know, keep your mouth shut.  Dave.  And then Dave's boss, the chick, over there.  I don't know.  Con.  Con.  Con.  Con.  How could you relate to someone that, you know, you're trying to do a show.  What's her name again?  You want to compete with us.  What's her name?  I don't even remember anymore.  I know her last name is Con.  Con.  The Con.  Con.  Con. 
[02:15:30]  Con.  Con.  Is it?  It's Con.  Is it Con-t?  No, it's just Con.  It is?  Con.  Con.  Con.  Con.  Don't make anything else into it.  Don't try to change the name.  It's just Con.  Right.  That's it.  Con.  Sure.  Con.  Con.  How do you tell your afternoon show how to compete with us? 
[02:16:00]  No, the whole station.  I heard it for myself when I was driving and being a wimp up in the mountains.  I'll admit it.  A call got through and they're like, oh, we can't do this.  No, it's against the rules they set out.  Don't be pussies.  You're going to lose anyway, but go out fighting.  Go out like a man.  We're stepping all over you.  At least fight back.  We've got a girl as their boss over there. 
[02:16:30]  Some woman that she's enjoying.  What was her last name?  Con.  I believe it was something like that.  Con.  I don't know.  Con.  K-A-H-N, I believe.  Con.  I don't know.  T-bag.  Con.  Con.  Face.  Right.  That's good.  Hey, how you doing?  Women managers in radio.  Awful stink. 
[02:17:00]  Julie Con, right?  That's her name?  That's your boss, Rocco?  We all know.  Does Julie tell you what to do?  We all know this is a man's business.  It's always cute when, like, one of these big radio companies puts a woman in charge at  some of these stations.  Well, it's great if you're in charge of something like, let's say, Light FM or something like  that.  Never works.  Or just having the donuts and coffee sent up on time.  Right.  You want a light music station?  You know, something like that?  That's fine.  But when you're in an aggressive station and you've got to compete with the likes of this 
[02:17:30]  show, you've got to have some balls to you.  Don't embarrass yourselves over there.  At least fight back, because you're going to lose anyway.  But at least you could say, you know, when you're looking for another job, you could go,  you know, at least I didn't take it, and I tried to fight, and I tried to win.  Yeah.  It was hilarious, Ant.  Hilarious.  Hey, what's going on?  Wait, Julie's telling me what to do.  Listen, that's classic. 
[02:18:00]  All right, we still have to play the Carol Miller stuff.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Opie's big idea?  Yeah.  There is no big idea.  Oh, who do you think he is?  Gary Wall?  Later, guys.  Why not Yemen?  I come up with some fine ideas.  Why not Yemen?  Why not Yemen?  I come up with some fine ideas for this show.  I want to hear the new one.  All right.  All right.  Because it was something about that movie, the Michael Douglas movie that got you started. 
[02:18:30]  No, this is the God's and the truth, because you know what?  We've got to get more back to normal with this radio show.  We've got to get the debauchery back.  It's been way too long.  Last week, there was a girl naked on our show, and we didn't even care.  We didn't even try to play What's in My Pants.  None of that.  We just let her go.  Was it Julie Kahn?  Because we're still...  She stinks.  No?  All right.  Was it who?  Huh? 
[02:19:00]  I thought it was because we were talking about Julie Kahn.  You know, I'm just filled with AIDS.  I'm going to let Rob get on the air here, because...  Rob.  Rob.  Yeah.  Hey, go ahead.  Yeah, I want to know why you guys are being hypocritical pussies.  Go ahead.  Say it.  You guys are talking about a guy whose name rhymes with Howard Earn last year.  No.  You guys wouldn't say a word.  Ah, you dick.  Listen to this.  Now, this is how you're talking about a guy's in Boston.  All right.  Hold on and listen.  Rob, I didn't have to take your call, so we'll talk about this, okay?  Okay.  I saw what you wanted to say on the screen here.  Uh-huh.  And we take this stuff on.  Okay. 
[02:19:30]  First of all, you're talking about Howard Stern.  We're allowed to say his name.  Oh, you are allowed to say his name now.  No.  And last year, we continued to say his name.  Them down the hall were dumping out of our show.  We continued saying his name and saying what we had to about him.  I don't think I remember that part.  Rob, hey, dickbag Rob, listen to this.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I remember you picked your pumpkins last year.  Hold on, Rob.  I remember that part.  Rob, listen to this.  Okay.  Now, it just got dumped out because you can't say that on the radio, and the person down the  hall had dumped out the F word I just said.  Did you hear me say the F word? 
[02:20:00]  Are you guys in charge of your show or not?  Did you just hear that?  All right.  Forget it.  He doesn't understand.  Are you guys in charge of your show or not?  An effing a-hole.  They dump out of it because we can't say that on the radio.  Now, people were dumping out of when we said Howard Stern, Rob, last year.  They would dump out of it in another, you know, in a locked room down the hall, Rob.  Rob, this was a major problem with our show.  We all could agree with that.  We continued saying what we had to say. 
[02:20:30]  They decided to dump out of it down the hall.  Our contract ended, and it was a big deal for us.  If we were going to re-sign with this company, that we would be allowed to not only say Howard  Stern's name, we'd also be able to, you know, fight back if we had to.  And that's where we are today.  There you go.  We won that battle.  You won that battle?  Yeah.  Thank you, Rob.  Well, something tells me he called with a different agenda than just to get the facts. 
[02:21:00]  It's all right.  I love that example because that's exactly what happens.  You will not hear us say the F word for the most part on these airwaves.  But it said a lot.  Oh, believe me, it is said a lot.  And it gets dumped out of it.  There you go.  All right.  So, uh...  That guy was a jerk.  I hope he doesn't come to Rascals tomorrow night at 8th to see Jim Norton.  He wasn't a jerk.  You know, he had something, and we discussed it. 
[02:21:30]  I'm all right with that.  The first ten people that come to Rascals were going to carve out some little chestnuts  and make pipes out of them.  Is that something they have people doing?  Yeah.  I want to hear the idea.  I need the idea now.  All right.  Because we do have to get back to some of the debauchery.  And I guarantee that a lot of radio shows, hoo, hoo, hoo, will rip this off.  Okay.  And this is going to be our first contest that involves the entire country, Anthony.  Right.  You know how we have done the best boob contest? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  The best ass contest?  Did we do the best snatch contest yet?  No.  No, I don't think...  No, no, no.  I think they have a problem with that.  Yeah, they do have a problem with that.  In that context.  Yes.  We'll have to figure that out.  And I would go on to say, I think this is my best idea since the Aztec idea.  Which I still think we should do.  Yeah.  We had a car to give away. 
[02:22:30]  And we were going to get five guys.  We had them lined up.  We had five guys lined up to do this.  They were willing to sign whatever it took.  That's why the lawyers have got to get back on top of this so we can do this.  Yeah.  We were going to take these five guys.  We were going to make them put their junk in a jar.  With a B in each jar.  Wasp.  Wasp, whatever.  Or we would have went with yellow jackets, whatever.  Scorpion.  No.  Either like a wasp or a yellow jacket or a bumblebee. 
[02:23:00]  And the first guy that gets the bee or the yellow jacket or the wasp to sting his unit in the jar would win the car.  We had guys lined up.  We had a date.  It was ready to go.  Ready to do it.  We had so many guys calling.  It was ridiculous.  And we had rules.  They couldn't take the bee out and then just hold it and jab themselves at the stinger.  No.  It would just be them junk in the jar.  They would have to wait.  Bang on the side of the jar.  Bang on the side of the jar.  Whatever it was supposed to piss off the bee.  And wait for it to sting. 
[02:23:30]  That is creepy.  Norton can't even listen to that.  So what's the new contest?  Norton's lips are in the jar now?  So.  We're working on getting that idea on the radio.  It's in the lawyer's hand, unfortunately.  Right.  My new idea, Anthony?  Douche or dressing?  Douche or dressing is your new idea?  No.  Hey.  Shut up.  Douche or dressing.  All right. 
[02:24:00]  Simple as this.  It's called the naughty.  Naughty.  Naughty.  Always a good word.  Naughty.  Naughty.  That's naughty.  Naughty.  Naughty.  The naughty.  Naughty.  Nighty contest.  Naughty nighties.  Naughty nighties.  And this is open to the whole country.  Yeah.  And this did pop in my brain.  The whole country.  While I was waiting for a stupid moose to walk out of the woods.  You're right.  Naughty nighty.  Because I had a clear mind.  Okay.  The naughty nighty contest.  How does it work?  It's very easy.  Okay. 
[02:24:30]  Okay.  It's not set up yet.  Maybe we can start tomorrow.  The women will put on their naughty nighties.  Naughty nighties.  In honor of don't say a word.  Okay.  Oh, that's where the Michael Douglas.  Well, how does it fit into that?  Just because I saw the commercial a million times like everyone else.  And she's in the mental hospital in the bed with her naughty nighty.  Is that a naughty nighty she's wearing?  Sure.  Or it could tie in if she comes in the studio and we assault her and she doesn't tell anyone. 
[02:25:00]  Naughty nighty.  Naughty nighty.  We have the ladies all over the country to take pictures of themselves in their naughty nighties.  They have to have Opie and Anthony in the picture to prove that it's, you know, them.  So they won't be coming down here.  No, because we got to, you know, we got to get the whole contest involved.  The whole country.  The whole country.  The whole country.  The whole country.  The whole country.  Country.  Julie country.  No, Julie Con.  Smells like hot garbage. 
[02:25:30]  Auto.  All right.  The whole country.  Right.  Okay.  And then everyone's involved.  That's great.  And just to prove that it's you, whatever, and you're doing it for our show, because,  you know, you get the idiots that comb the Internet for naughty nighty pictures or whatever.  Right.  Anyway.  That so did make it.  That so did not make it.  You're insane.  You pushed it too far, my friend. 
[02:26:00]  You can say country as long as you want.  But you can't pause in between syllables, my friend.  You can't be crazy about it.  Right.  Sorry.  No one says it that way.  Sure.  And you can even say country.  My grandmother used to say kettle and settle.  All right.  So, and what we're going to do is on opianthony.com.  Bottle.  Yeah.  On opianthony.com.  We'll have like a link or somewhere where you can send the pictures in. 
[02:26:30]  Send your pictures.  All right.  I got to set it up with Scott Colombo, you know, our Internet guy and all that.  But, and we got to get a really good prize.  Maybe the prize will be, I don't know.  We'll figure out something.  Sure.  But there's my new idea.  I like it.  Nice.  And it's the naughtiest nightie in the country.  Yeah.  Nice.  Could it be a nightie you have behaved naughtily in?  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Stained.  By the way, I hope he's listening.  Oh, he sounded great this morning.  Anyway.  Hey, what's going on? 
[02:27:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Sounded all right.  So, that's what's going to happen.  And we'll have more details very soon.  The cool thing is, too, you know, we'll get some, we'll get the pictures on the Internet  for everyone to check out.  We'll get some finalists, Anthony.  Yeah.  And then we'll have everyone vote from all over the country, and you won't know, and  you won't know, you guys are having an effect on me today.  It's country.  I know.  And we'll see, you know, which city that we broadcast to has the naughtiest nightie. 
[02:27:30]  Yes.  Just think of the possibilities.  Yeah.  Oh, sure.  Every girl trying to look naughtier.  Look naughtier.  Because I'm sure it'll work out where we get a finalist from every city, perhaps.  And then now, you know...  But we're not going to say where the girls are from.  Oh, no.  That'll be an extra thing at the end.  We'll go, well, San Francisco had the best, and New York was second, and Philly and Boston.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But that just means, you know, every city out there, you've got to get the naughtiest nightie. 
[02:28:00]  And the naughtiest girl.  Hey, can she do things while she's modeling her naughty nightie?  You know, I think a girl laying back in a bed with a naughty nightie, pretty sexy.  And I think a girl laying back in a bed in a naughty nightie, you know, with certain things...  I understand, but no, no, the problem is...  What?  Because of, you know, the...  Oh, we...  It's going to have to be the poses, whatever you want to show up top is cool.  As soon as you start messing around with the... 
[02:28:30]  Down there?  The downstairs, they have a problem, and then it's going to screw up the whole contest.  I think we could still have some really hot shots coming in with the girls just getting  creative without, you know, their...  Girls picking leaves in 90s, or waiting for moose, waiting for mule.  Possible to have a girl in a naughty nightie maybe being mounted by a German shepherd.  Nice!  Yeah!  Why not?  So there you go.  I like it. 
[02:29:00]  My cute little idea from the weekend.  We'll start it up tomorrow.  We'll have all the details.  Hopefully, we'll have the email address set up where you can send them, you know.  People are already saying, no, no, God.  That means we're going to have to see Stalker Patty in a naughty nightie.  No, no, no.  No, Stalker Patty was like filler before we got syndicated.  We have enough beautiful women that are listening to us all over the country to fill up our website  with just the best shots, okay?  Right.  And we're going to have a really good prize.  So, sales, you whores. 
[02:29:30]  There you go.  We just gave you a gift today.  Get us a grand prize for the naughty nightie contest.  Sorry, it's at my house.  All right.  We have to do the fight stuff next, don't we?  Rick dug up some really classic stuff.  I'm telling you.  It was brutal.  Brutal fight.  If you're in your driveway, you're going to have to stay in the driveway for a few tonight  because it's really good stuff.  And we'll do it next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  New York, Dallas, Chicago, Philly, Cleveland, Columbus, Sacramento, San Francisco. 
[02:30:00]  The Empire is spreading.  Conquer us, you bastards!  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jim Norton in studio.  He's playing somewhere tomorrow night.  I don't know.  Let the whore promote himself again.  Go ahead.  Rascals in West Orange.  With Richard Voss and Jeff Norris.  And Voss in the studio today.  Here.  Erica, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right, Erica.  I just want to, I was calling to tell you guys, I go to grad school out here at UMass Bowl 
[02:30:30]  and I just started listening to you guys.  You guys are unbelievable.  Everything from, like, September 11th to, like, you guys are just amazing.  I think you ought to know that, you know, there's some really hot chicks out there that  think you guys are awesome.  Look at me plunking down a compliment call because I was feeling a little, you know,  a little sad today.  Oh, you poor thing.  No, but you guys are just awesome.  I mean, and, you know, I'm going to have to take a picture of myself and my little Naughty  Night.  Oh, you know what?  Naughty Night is going to be one of the greatest contests we ever come up with. 
[02:31:00]  Nothing.  You guys, I mean, your contests are just hilarious.  I mean, I listen to you guys and I listen to, you know, Stern.  You're allowed to say Stern now, right?  Yeah.  I listen to Stern in the mornings and you guys are just rocking.  I mean, you're so, like, exactly what kids, people our age need to, like, be listening  to.  How old are you, if I may?  I'm 23.  Nice.  Too old.  I'm too old?  What are you talking about?  That was Voss.  That was Voss.  He just likes young girls because they can lisp at each other. 
[02:31:30]  Oh.  Oh.  See?  You know, it's weird.  Hold on.  Now I'm calling this bastard out.  Well, Erica, that came from the same guy that, while the commercials were playing, he said,  hey, I went to North Carolina or South?  South Carolina.  Like it matters.  South Carolina.  And he was having a tough time picking up women for the past week.  And the last night you were in town, a girl said, come back to my place, I'll strap it  on, and blah, blah, blah.  Right?  Yeah.  That's what she wanted me to do.  Strap it on.  Strap it on.  She wanted me to, yeah.  Strap, strap, strap it on. 
[02:32:00]  And Voss won't allow that unless it's a real man standing behind him.  Woo.  None of that fake stuff.  Yeah.  Why go for the fake thing when you go for the real thing?  Right, Voss?  Yeah.  It's no fun if you don't risk a rapid weight loss.  Oh, my God.  It's awesome.  All right, Erica.  It's a long fall.  We're going to have details on the Naughty Nighty contest tomorrow.  We're going to have it all set up, all right?  You guys are awesome.  I will be there.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  All right.  There she goes, Erica.  So cute.  Some hot college chick. 
[02:32:30]  She said, thanks, bye.  Yeah, see?  Nice.  All right.  Well, Rick worked for the last hour and a half on these clips from the famous fight we  had with Carol Miller.  Right.  And you want to do the set up because we started the show kind of reminiscing a bit, and this  is what made Rick try to find this stuff.  Yeah, we were talking about when we first got here to this legendary rock station in New  York three years ago.  It was WNEW and a huge heritage rock station.  A lot of classic jocks were here. 
[02:33:00]  Jocks from the past.  Very well-known in name here in the city.  Carol Miller, one of them.  Sure.  And when we came in, you know, we were the upstarts.  We were going to wreck it for all them.  For some reason, that's what they thought.  And Carol was one of them, you know.  I think she knew that when we came in here, it meant those jocks were going.  And we didn't get along very well. 
[02:33:30]  Carol Kahn?  No, no, not Carol Kahn.  No, that's Julie Kahn.  This stinks.  Kahn is like a hot dog, you know?  Kahn, the wrath of Kahn.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I like Kahn.  Anyway.  Caught it out.  I'm not trying to be a Weisenheimer.  Sure, Weisenheimer.  You, hey.  I just don't remember her name.  You just watch it, you.  You just pipe down over there.  Pipe down. 
[02:34:00]  Pipe down now.  I want me.  So, I'll make a long story short.  Carol, you know, when she was here, it was all about the music.  All about the music.  Spinning the tunes.  Talking about the artists.  And, obviously, Ant and I, not really about that, especially when it comes to classic rock.  Right.  Classic rock.  Rock.  Just imagine the fun they would have been having today as Rocktober kicks off.  Oh, I know.  Too bad. 
[02:34:30]  So, Carol came in to challenge us because we were just trashing everybody, trashing the  station, trashing people that were here for 30 years because it was time to move on.  Yeah.  And, uh, she couldn't let go.  And, you know what?  I respect her for fighting with us.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Everyone else would talk bad about us behind our backs and stuff.  No one ever challenged us.  Always behind our backs.  But we were trashing everybody in the open.  They all did it behind closed doors except for one person, Carol Miller.  And I respect her for that.  I really do. 
[02:35:00]  I respect people that can, you know, that try to fight back.  Right.  That's why I don't respect anyone at AAF up in Boston.  There you go.  They've been told not to talk about us.  And they're a bunch of pussies for not, you know, going out fighting because we all know  we're going to kick their ass.  They'll do nothing.  At least lose trying, you know, trying to win.  Mm-hmm.  Make it a little harder for us, anyway.  Oh, yeah.  This is...  Sounds like Voss trying to say something.  Oh.  No, that's Carol because she had a tough time. 
[02:35:30]  She had a tough time with her Ws.  Right, Ant?  A W.  She had a tough time with her Ws.  A W-doos.  Jimmy.  W-doos.  W-doos.  W-doos.  She would say W-doos, N-E-W-doos.  W-doos, N-E-W-doos.  W-doos, N-E-W-doos.  That's all right.  Like a little clogged sinus thing.  That's all right.  W-doos, N-E-W-doos.  I heard recently she did a shift at K-Rock.  Right.  Across the street there.  Sure.  Thank God she doesn't have to say W-doos.  Oh, that's right.  Do they have her saying W?  Queenston.  No, because you don't have to say it. 
[02:36:00]  I mean, do you guys have to do.  Queenston doesn't make his jock say the call letter.  That's pretty funny.  Okay.  So are we ready to play these clips?  What's the first one, Rick?  The first one is when this whole thing pretty much goes down, when she first enters the studio.  I think this was after about, after Ed and I just trashing the station and the old jocks were like,  Well, you know what it was?  And she finally, she was on after us and she said, you know what, I've had enough. 
[02:36:30]  It was actually during the evolution of the rock of New York.  Oh, the air pollution of rock.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's another story for another time, I think, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So here's the first clip as Carol comes into the studio to challenge us.  This is classic stuff.  People have tapes of this and they've been sending it all over the world.  Carol Miller hates us.  Here, plug in your headphones, Carol.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Carol is going to be representative of the people that appreciate this music and this special program, 
[02:37:00]  the Evolution of the Rock of New York, that has been put together here on WNEW.  WNEW.  All right.  So what problem did you have with us yesterday, Carol?  Yeah.  You.  I had a problem with you.  The two of you.  What happened?  What happened?  No, I'm just kidding.  Uh, she didn't like the fact that Anthony was playing the kazoo to all these great classic  rock songs.  I was.  These cheesy butt old classic rock songs.  Yeah.  How can we go?  I totally did. 
[02:37:30]  I forgot about that.  You know, I haven't had my kazoo in so long.  I need another kazoo.  That's right.  I was playing kazoo to, uh, all the classic rock songs.  Yeah.  And people took this special very seriously.  Yeah.  Quickly.  They put together a special that kind of, uh, commemorated the years of history that this  station had.  And it went on for, I think, 18 years.  I think this special went on.  It went on for a lot of hours.  It was so long.  It was, like, at least a week, maybe two.  Gary's a great idea.  And it was, uh, uh, this station from when it first came on the air to when, uh, you 
[02:38:00]  know, we, that day we were playing it.  And everything in between, all the news clips from the various years.  They started from, like, 1967, I think.  And then they moved on to 68 and 69.  Jimmy went insane putting this together.  Jimmy still works here at production.  He won an award for this.  He won an award.  And he deserved it.  I mean, it was well produced, but it was a stupid idea.  It was the dumbest idea.  We were trying to get away from that image.  And all of a sudden, they were embracing it. 
[02:38:30]  Right.  Like, Gary decided to, uh, uh, give it a...  1972.  So, all of a sudden, you're spending your entire day listening to 1978 music.  And you're like, what?  Who cares?  So, Ant just, like, we'd turn the mics on, and Ant's like, woo!  And this was when we were still supposed to be playing music.  So, we're sitting here playing this evolution of the rock in New York.  But every song we'd play, we'd pot up the mics, and then they'd start playing kazoo to it.  Or we'd sing, uh, the dirty, uh, words to the songs or something. 
[02:39:00]  And they didn't appreciate that we were mocking the music.  All right.  So, here's, here's Carol.  Go ahead.  From a week before we start this special, goofing on but old rock.  And then we go into but old rock.  And we're supposed to act like, uh, we liked it.  Uh, listen.  First of all, it's a matter of opinion.  But, you know, a lot of this stuff, including the stuff that you were ranking on yesterday.  I mean, I really dig this stuff.  I was playing it for people.  Of course, people will dig this stuff.  And you know something?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I dig this stuff, too, when I heard it on NAW. 
[02:39:30]  But I don't want to hear it anymore.  I want to move on.  I want to move on to the future.  Yeah, well, I want to hear it.  What do you want to hear?  Third eye, meatball, blind?  No, I want to hear the latest from the Black Crows.  I want to hear the latest from Kiss.  Yeah, so?  The latest from the Rolling Stones.  We can't play any of that this week, because we have to play Marshall Crenshaw someday, somewhere.  This is a good trip down, like, a recent memory lane.  We've been doing that for 31 years.  31 years here at NAW.  This has been a classic rock station for many years.  We've been going down memory lane.  You don't know. 
[02:40:00]  Most of these people have every single one of these CDs at home.  If they want to take a trip down memory lane, then they should play it at home.  You should go talk at home.  Oh, that hurts.  Oh, my God.  That is great.  You should go talk at home.  That was like Marion from Lady Di and Marion, before actual Marion.  Yeah.  You should go talk at home.  You know, I haven't heard this in well over a year.  We were pretty damn brave, because we had no listeners, no support.  Everyone at the station hated us.  No one was listening to us. 
[02:40:30]  They could care less about us.  We didn't care.  And we took them all on.  What time slot was that?  What time was that on?  Was that 3 to 7?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Here's the second clip.  All right.  How many listeners did we gain today by going down memory lane playing Marshall Crenshaw someday, somewhere?  Marshall Crenshaw did a really nice Christmas concert for us.  I don't care.  I don't care anymore.  A lot of people do.  This is the music that has gotten us to 23rd place.  No, no, no.  Yes, it is.  You know what's that?  For God's sake, Carol.  No, it isn't.  If we played most of this music, we wouldn't be in 23rd place. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, my God.  You're on crack, Carol.  I'm not on crack.  There's a lot of music.  Are you having a flashback?  Did you do Acid back in the 60s?  No, I wish I did.  Are you having a flashback?  No.  This is not the music that is going to get us into our first place.  Wow.  Look at Anthony being crescent over there.  Yeah, see?  Our show was in, like, 23rd place.  The whole station was, like, completely.  No, the whole station was even worse.  Yeah, even worse.  Our show.  Like, 28th.  My God.  How funny is that, though?  All right. 
[02:41:30]  Here's the clip of me begging her to resign, Rich.  Yeah.  This is pretty much the first time.  It happens throughout the entire damn argument.  It's hilarious.  But this is when you ask her to resign, and I think this is also where you ask her to take  every single CD.  Well, because the world's largest rock and roll library.  Yeah, we're known for the world's largest rock and roll library.  Look at it now.  It's been pilfered.  Yeah.  Looks like it has AIDS.  There's nothing left over there.  But, um...  Nice.  Yeah, we asked...  Well, because management, they were a bunch of pussies.  Yeah.  They should have just fired everyone if they were going to go in this new direction all at once. 
[02:42:00]  Instead, it was like, well, we'll fire this person, then a month later we'll fire them,  and then eventually we'll get everyone fired.  I just wanted to speed along the process.  So here's us begging her to resign.  Carol, take all these CDs.  Look at them.  I'm looking at them.  I'll get a U-Haul truck.  Take every single one of these CDs, resign, take those CDs, and you can play them wherever  you want.  And we'll compete and see who ends up in the top ten first.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, but I'll tell you one thing.  I'm going to deal with you.  If I play my CDs for a month, and you yak for a month and play yours, I bet you you 
[02:42:30]  go down to 25th.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Oh, no, no.  I would like that bet.  No, listen.  Seriously, guys.  I love you.  If you're brave enough, resign, take all the CDs, and trust me, there's so many radio stations  in New York, so I won't pick you up.  I'll tell you all something.  You can take all these CDs and play them and see what happens.  I should trust you.  Yeah, trust me.  Now, why shouldn't you trust me?  Resign on the air right now.  Carol Miller's going to be fine.  Oh, kiss my ass, but you'd probably like it. 
[02:43:00]  Come on.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You resign on the air.  Resign on the air.  We've got to move forward here.  Resign.  Yeah, we are.  Take all these CDs, I'll get the U-Haul truck, and resign right now.  No, I resign myself to hopefully remaining in my seat, playing the best rock of the present  past and future that I possibly can.  Is it only a coincidence that the only people that are enjoying this is Carol and Dave Herman?  I don't say...  Oh, I've got to hear the dub-a-duh.  Okay.  Oh, was it ending? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, I didn't know.  Just if we could hear the dub-a-duh, any dub-a-duh again.  Yeah, let me go back in five seconds.  I love that part.  The dub-a-duh, dub-a-duh, dub-a-duh, dub-a-duh.  Dub-a-duh, any dub-a-duh.  Let's hear it.  Go, go, go, go.  I just love that part.  I'll continue playing the best music.  The past, present, future, or dub-a-duh, dub-a-duh, dub-a-duh.  Got it?  Go.  The past is a future that I possibly can.  Is it only a coincidence?  Dub-a-duh, dub-a-duh, they're rocking to yours.  The only people that are enjoying this is Carol, Scotso, and Dave Herman.  I don't know that Dave and...  There you go. 
[02:44:00]  So, that's a...  She guaranteed that, you know...  I guarantee...  If we continued yapping that we'd go down to 25th place.  I'd like to resign myself to sitting here and kiss my ass.  You should talk at home.  After 30 years out of the year, those are the best singers.  Well, the best was at some point...  We had nothing, too.  So, when she said stuff like that, I was like, oh, that hurts.  Because we had no ratings, nothing.  She was crowing at one point that at one time she had a 2-1.  I think it was 2-7 back in 85. 
[02:44:30]  No, no.  Not even a 2-7, I don't think.  I think she said she had a 2-1.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, and that we would never, ever beat her ratings.  All right, go ahead.  Let's play another clip.  Let's hear this.  She's not going to resign.  No, I'm not going to resign.  You can have all these CDs and resign.  No, you can have these microphones and resign.  You have the best CD collection in the history of...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Mankind.  You know, actually, we do here at WNW, and that's why we're playing it for you.  Oh, my God.  The company line. 
[02:45:00]  This is my music, man.  Don't mess with my music.  All right, we have to take a quick break, because Ben is freaking out.  We'll take a really short break, I promise.  Okay.  And then we'll play the rest of the clips from the fight.  It gets better.  We got an analogy on the way.  Oh, good.  She talks about ratings and how no one's listening to us.  That kind of hurt.  Yeah, it did.  It did.  And, oh, wow.  And then when we were yelling at her to get out, and we just refused to turn the mics off 
[02:45:30]  until she got out of the studio.  A lot of really good stuff.  I promise it's going to be a very short break.  Stay there.  You guys have deteriorated to beyond belief right now.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Just a few minutes left.  And we're in the middle of a really good segment.  The Sox running out of time.  Let's get right back to it.  We're not going to be able to play all the clips from the fight is what it comes down to. 
[02:46:00]  So we'll play a couple more, and then someone's got to remind us to just start the show with this tomorrow  so we can get it out of the way, okay?  Okay.  Because to rush through it is not smart at all.  Let's get back to it.  All right, Carol Miller.  Yeah, one of the jocks that were here.  When we got here at N.E.W. Classic Rock Station.  Worked in New York City forever, and it was all about the music.  It was all about talking about the music, blah, blah, blah, okay?  Right.  And when we came to town, it meant change, and there was a little struggle there. 
[02:46:30]  A little piss.  Somebody was going to win, and someone was going to lose.  That was obvious to everyone, okay?  Right.  So Carol Miller was in the studio, and we were going back and forth,  talking about the old days and the new days, and blah, blah, blah.  A little argument.  All right, so here's her with an analogy, I think.  Go ahead.  Oh, stick around.  The Stray Cat.  Stray Cat Strut is on the way.  Can't wait to hear that again.  And I think I've only heard it 8,000 times so far.  How many times have you worn those jeans?  What jeans?  Whatever you wear.  Whatever they are there.  What does that have to do with the price of tomatoes? 
[02:47:00]  I'll tell you what.  Because your favorite music is kind of like your favorite clothes.  I'm not wearing bell-bottoms anymore.  I don't need to.  I've moved on with my...  You want to do that analogy.  Sometimes your underwear gets skid marks, so you've got to throw away.  Well, I'll tell you something about that.  Do you want to talk about laundry?  Bell-bottoms.  Bell-bottoms are in this year.  Oh, I'm turning your mic off.  We've got to move on.  Nice, Ant.  Right to the duty underwear comparison.  Well, you know something?  She wanted to bring out the laundry analogy.  So then she left, and then she comes back with enemas, right? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  She came back with, like, she went to Dwayne Reed and picked up a box of enemas.  Yeah, a couple of enemas to give both of us.  Like, she was like, here, here's enemas.  Right.  Because I don't even know what it meant, but I guess she thought it was fine.  All right, so here we go.  Carol Miller walked back in the studio and handed us enemas.  She gave us a couple of enemas.  Handed us enemas.  I don't get it, Carol.  Hello?  Hello?  I don't get it.  What does this mean?  What does this mean?  What does this mean?  I don't know.  She had to run out to the, what does this mean? 
[02:48:00]  What is wrong with you?  No, no, dear.  You see, I.  Are you having an acid flashback?  What is an enema supposed to.  I don't know what acid was in there, but that was for you, dear.  What does this mean?  What does it mean?  Well, actually, you see, I, you know, I left, and I was on my conscience.  I didn't want to, you know, fight with you guys.  I love you guys.  And I thought.  What does an enema mean?  Shove it up your ass.  Oh, wow.  So I thought perhaps there might be something, you know, that constructed you could do. 
[02:48:30]  So, Carol, what.  Once you.  We had enough.  I won.  No.  Bye.  No, no, you didn't win.  Yeah, I won.  No, no.  Trust me, you did not win.  Trust me.  Trust me, you did not win.  I got, I got my conscience.  I speak my mind.  You don't.  Oh.  Oh, it's getting ugly.  All right, one more, because then we're going to have to get out of here.  Now she brings up ratings.  Yeah.  You guys have been trying to make this a kick-ass rock stage for 15 years. 
[02:49:00]  No, no, no, no.  How many years have you been here?  I've been here 15.  Have you guys ever been out of 20th place?  Absolutely.  How long ago?  Can you remember the fact that far?  Yeah, I'll tell you, when we really had our best ratings, I would say, actually, I have  the ratings at home, about 1985 or so.  Oh, that's 13 years ago.  No, but we actually.  That's great.  That's fantastic.  Okay, great.  If you're asking me when we had our best ratings, that would be it.  1985.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Okay, that's great.  Yeah, okay.  So for the last 13 years, you guys have been trying to get back there and nothing's happened? 
[02:49:30]  No, actually, no, no, that's not really what happened.  Well, you've been trying to get back there.  You know what?  We ran out of time.  This is soft.  We hate to do this, but we'll pick this up tomorrow at 3, okay?  All right.  That's some really, really good stuff.  We'll be able to focus a little more on it, all right?  Yeah.  Jim Noren at Fast, Jim, because we're late.  Rascal's West Orange with Voss and Norris tomorrow.  I think it's an 8.30 show.  That's going to be a great time.  And guys, sorry about this, but please remind us, we'll do it first thing tomorrow, okay? 
[02:50:00]  All right.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Hi, we're here under your skin, us two A-holes.  Hello, Opie and Anthony. </pre>
