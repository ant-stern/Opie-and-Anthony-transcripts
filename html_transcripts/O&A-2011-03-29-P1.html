<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the usual vulgar banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, punctuated by Anthony's hiccups and a discussion of a false Jackie Chan death rumor on Twitter.  This quickly devolves into a discussion of flatulence, specifically Norton's experience after consuming a juice and vegan muffin from a celebrity-frequented health food store.  The conversation then shifts to several topics: a planned investigation of another radio program, the disappointing sales of Charlie Sheen's tour (blamed on ticket brokers), Anthony's exhaustion with online political debates, and a scathing review of the new Tiger Woods golf video game.

Danny McBride then joins the show to promote *Your Highness*.  The discussion centers on the movie's explicit content, including extensive descriptions of nudity, violence, and profanity, with humorous details on how they creatively handled showing male genitalia on screen using a Minotaur.  Nostalgic reminiscences about watching adult films on scrambled cable TV as children ensue.  The conversation also touches upon the movie's marketing challenges, particularly a scene that resembles gang rape.  Further discussion involves McBrideâ€™s experiences working with James Franco and Natalie Portman, his lack of formal acting training, and his creative process.  A caller inquires about McBride replacing Steve Carell on *The Office*, which he denies.  The trailer for *Your Highness* is shown and discussed, along with tangents about contagious cavities and a comparison of Britt Ekland and Jill Klayberg's appearances.  McBride's other projects, including *Eastbound and Down*, are also discussed. The segment ends with McBride's departure and a brief, inconclusive discussion of *Up in the Air*.

The show continues with a discussion about Brock Lesnar's recent interaction with The Undertaker, speculating on its authenticity.  The hosts mention securing the upcoming interview with Lesnar's help from Ariel Helwani and Paul Heyman, and discuss a previous movie they made with McBride that one host disliked.  A significant portion focuses on a "camel toe pad" product, along with crude and sexually charged commentary.  Further tangents include a loose cobra from the Bronx Zoo and its surprisingly popular Twitter account, a story about one host having sex with a stranger while Wayne Gretzky scored his final goal, and a bit referencing movie lines, particularly from *The Omen*.  Upcoming guests, including Lesnar, Norm MacDonald, and Donald Trump Jr., are mentioned, along with a dispute with a former colleague, Scorch, who is creating his own television program.  The hosts conclude this segment by criticizing their production staff for poor coffee, yogurt, and a lack of bowls.

The next segment begins with a discussion about the download numbers of an app, leading to a nonsensical yogurt-throwing game across the studio involving the hosts and a staff member, Kenny. The hosts then discuss their past experiences negotiating contracts with previous employers, including an April Fool's Day prank about Mayor Menino's death.  Numerous anecdotes involving lowball salary offers and fabricated offers from other stations are recounted.  A significant portion covers past encounters with celebrities: Jackie "The Joke Man," Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf (with humorous and offensive anecdotes about his life and death), a female midget stripper who auditioned, Colin Hanks and Jack Black (who were in studio at one point), Stephen Lang (who shared a story about Michael Dunn), Whoopi Goldberg (and a commercial for Poise pads), Gilda Radner, and Sarah Jessica Parker (including a phone call from Parker in response to the hosts' criticism).

The final segment opens with a discussion about a phone call from Sarah Jessica Parker reacting to a past on-air joke, contrasting her calm response with their expectation of anger.  Other celebrity calls are mentioned, including one from Nathan Lane.  The conversation includes a joke about a Jehovah's Witness, a discussion on the appropriateness of using "midget" versus "little person," a past parody of the Ted Danson blackface incident, and Whoopi Goldberg hanging up on them during a question about the incident.  The hypocrisy surrounding the Imus firing is discussed, along with differing standards for media personalities.  The segment concludes with Jackie Martling joining the show, promoting his comedy shows and discussing his online presence and the challenges of getting his name on various platforms.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We're doing some reconnaissance, right?  We're doing some reconnaissance, right? 
[00:01:30]  Is that how you say that?  Reconnaissance?  Get a little intel.  Getting a little intel.  I should have just went with intel.  Much easier to say.  That's all right.  The recon.  I just laughed so hard before the show, I think I just gave myself a hiccup.  Oh, shit.  I did.  Fuck.  Nothing worse than hiccups on the air.  Oh, God.  We just got info and we're just trying to see if it's true.  And it just figures.  Oh, yeah.  This would make perfect sense.  It just figures.  And then when we bring it up, we'll be the problem.  Yeah.  We'll be the problem again. 
[00:02:00]  Although it makes perfect sense.  I'm just going to state facts if it's true.  That's all I'm going to do today.  That's true.  It was a brilliant point on your part, by the way.  It was.  Thank you, Jimmy.  This started yesterday.  I tweeted.  Not tweeted.  I texted Jimmy.  And Jackie Chan, as far as I know, is not dead.  No, they got him on the Twitter trend, huh?  People keep tweeting it.  They got him.  Yeah.  They killed him off on Twitter.  Yeah.  He's the latest.  Rest in peace, Jackie Chan. 
[00:02:30]  He's not dead.  Get the hell out of here.  Good morning.  Welcome to the OP Nancy Show.  Danny dropped the cancer fart.  Oh, is it bad?  Where's our fart mask?  Let's get that going today.  Yeah, man.  Let's not forget about the fart mask.  The fucking intro music wasn't even over.  Oh, I know.  This place is disgusting.  I got hiccups.  He's farting.  Mars is fucking.  Mars is pissed off in the corner.  They're very sharp today.  Like sharp cheese.  Like sharp cheddar. 
[00:03:00]  I'm a fan of the sharp cheddar.  I like the sharp cheddar.  I'm actually very excited today.  I haven't had gas this disgusting in quite some time.  Are you excited because Danny McBride's coming in?  Oh, that too.  Oh, God.  It just hit me.  Oh, is he in today?  Danny McBride's in soon.  It's really good.  He's doing an early interview today.  Oh, good.  Oh, fuck.  And I think Sam saw the movie and he said this fucking movie is hilarious.  What's it called?  I don't know.  I didn't do any research last night.  That fucking moved so slow, dude.  What happened?  You're getting it now?  It just hit me.  It moved like a cloud, like slowly. 
[00:03:30]  Like a radiation cloud?  Yeah, a radiation cloud crossing the Pacific.  It's raining down on you now.  Oh, wow.  Sorry.  I laughed last night, by the way.  There was a line that made me laugh during the interview we did with the Australian guy.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Iraq, but I'm just going to laugh.  But the guy goes, yeah, he's pushing 400 pounds.  And you said, where's Iraq?  And then you just went, if he's pushing 400 pounds.  It didn't get the laugh it deserved.  I just was giggling.  We just kept going back and forth with the most inane shit while he was talking about his juice. 
[00:04:00]  I know.  And actually, I went to that place.  With his dumb juice.  I went to that place.  You went to Generations?  I did.  Isn't that place nice?  Oh, it was fucking great.  You know, Steven Spielberg goes there.  Really?  Who else?  Rob Lowe.  Who else?  Who else?  Robin Roberts.  Not that that's a biggie.  And Brooke Shields works out right next door.  Oh, really?  In a little private yoga studio or workout area.  My fart was so bad from the juice last night, it was fucking horrendous. 
[00:04:30]  And my girlfriend goes, oh my God, she goes, that smells red.  Your fart smells red.  Wow, it's like a color?  I'm like, wow.  Oh, and I thought about it as like, it was a red fucking juice I had.  You could make blind people see colors then.  You could just fart and be like, oh, that's red.  Yeah.  What combo did you have?  It's called Energy Plus or something?  Super Energy?  Energy Plus.  I just got a large Super Energy.  What is it?  Your little carrots?  Your little beets?  Yeah, a lot of cucumber.  I think they have apple in there.  Oh, you want cucumber. 
[00:05:00]  Cucumber is horrendous in these juices.  I like the vegetables.  They can't crush them down.  So you get like vegetable mud at the end that you got to try to swallow.  Don't eat that.  It's horrible.  It was a special on the board.  And I bought two of the other ones myself.  And I ate a vegan fucking muffin.  What?  A vegan muffin was not bad.  Blueberry muffin.  Oh, the muffins there aren't bad?  The non-trans fats?  You're not going to turn that way, are you?  No, that's all I have.  Oh.  The word vegan sucks a dick, but in this case, these muffins aren't bad. 
[00:05:30]  They really aren't bad.  I hate vegans when you have to go out with one and try to fucking...  You could have just stopped there.  And they're just a pain in the ass to go out to dinner with?  And their farts just suck.  Oh, God.  What are they...  This fart is lingering in this room.  I swear, I still smell...  It's in my nose.  I told you it was really good.  Wow.  Well, let's...  That vegan's worse.  Those fucking soy farts and those Morningstar burger farts.  Get the fart mask if we're going to fart.  So Danny McBride's coming in at 7 o'clock. 
[00:06:00]  7?  Yeah.  So in 45 minutes, and yeah, his movie's called His Highness, I believe.  And Sam saw it already.  Got to go to a screening, and he says the movie's great.  Really, really funny.  Yeah, I saw previews for that.  Those previews look good.  Yeah.  Now you see the name of it.  I do remember it.  All right.  I haven't seen the previews or anything.  We're trying to get some intel.  Some intel. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, boy.  It's on another program around here.  That's all.  Yeah, yeah.  Just trying to do a little recon on that.  Yeah.  To see if there's hypocrisy going on.  Of course there is.  That's all.  For some reason, they just fuck us harder than anyone else.  Yes.  I'll never understand that.  I'll never understand that.  We get bent over a lot.  I know we're a bunch of dicks, especially me.  We're that abused child.  Yeah, I don't get it.  And it's a family of a bunch of children, but only one gets the shit beat out of it all 
[00:07:00]  the time.  Yeah, I just don't understand.  I don't know.  I guess if you try to change things, it makes it worse for yourself.  Yeah.  I guess you're supposed to just sit here and take it.  Man.  But man, if this one thing is true, I'm going to have to use the word.  I haven't used it in a while.  I'm going to be stupefied.  A stupefied.  I'm going to be a stupefied.  And I just want to start the show by saying I hate the new Tiger Woods golf game. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, you've been playing it now?  The graphics are the same as last year.  Enough already.  Same thing.  I was going into detail with Anthony.  Maybe it's not worth it unless you play sports games, but it looks just okay.  It looks flat.  You just know that the graphics on video games are so much better now, and I don't know  why they're not updating that shit.  And they added the Masters to this new game, so I think that was their selling point.  Like, oh, everyone will buy this game because it's the first time that they're offering Augusta.  Augusta, yeah.  Because they didn't have the Augusta golf course for forever, I guess, and they finally are 
[00:08:00]  offering that, so they figured that's good enough for people to run to the stores and  get this game.  But I want better graphics already.  Well, that'll be the next game, I bet.  When, though?  Whenever they put out a new game, it'll be like, oh, yeah, and now new graphics.  It'll be like, oh, great.  Right.  Is it once a year?  Yeah, and I buy it every year.  Last year, I barely played it because it was like, okay, I've done this game already.  You know, so you want something different, and the way they can make it different is really 
[00:08:30]  kick-ass on the graphics.  More dynamic lighting and shadows and textures.  It looks very flat.  Yeah, I told you, like, the sunlight looks just kind of hazy.  Hazy, yeah.  Like a hazy sunlight when you know they can make sunlight in video games now to look that  just very vibrant.  Yeah.  That alone.  And I was telling you, when you look at the screen, you can't tell it's raining, so you  fuck up a golf shot.  That's getting a little technical now.  But then you look at the screen closely, you go, oh, it's raining.  Oh, I didn't see the rain.  In other golf games, one I kind of liked, I might be dating myself now, but Hot Shots, 
[00:09:00]  you could tell it was raining.  Even when I was playing it four or five years ago, the sunlight was way better than the sunlight  in this new version.  And you could see the individual blades of grass moving in Hot Shots.  Yeah.  You don't really get that in Tiger Woods.  You want that immersion in a game where it looks cool.  I'm just giving it an average review so far.  Oh.  Is that the technicality?  That might be, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  That's a paid intern.  Come on.  We all know that's a paid intern.  Oh, boy.  Maybe we should shut off that for now.  Damn, that sucks.  For now, we'll shut off.  It'll come out.  So I played that for two or three hours last night, and it's it's.  It's the same as the other game.  The last version.  I'm a fan of the Tiger Woods golf games, but they're kind of losing me a little bit.  I don't hate it.  I will definitely play it a couple hundred hours.  But you kind of want to see something new.  I was expecting something a little better to look at. 
[00:10:00]  It sucks when you fucking open that box up.  You put a new game in.  You're all psyching.  You're just kind of right at the beginning.  You know, and you kind of go, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, they're not.  Do you guys need to join Gamefly.com?  Yes, where you can try out the games before you buy them.  I don't play a lot of games.  You know that.  I play maybe I play Tiger Woods every year, and then maybe I sneak one or two more in here  and there type shit.  That's that's my game play.  So enough of that, because people are asking. 
[00:10:30]  That's what I'm thinking.  And it's coming out today, I guess.  Right.  Is it?  Yeah.  For everybody.  Yeah.  Well, good luck.  Have fun.  Keep up your good nature.  Yeah, let's do that.  Charlie Sheen, you brought this to my attention, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  I couldn't be happier.  Now, I want to just fill in Jimmy a little bit.  Jimmy, you know, like this Charlie Sheen, he's a crazy mofo.  Yes, he's been acting.  And now he's now he's touring all over the country.  And you saw how all his tickets sold out.  And it made a lot of people frustrated.  A lot of tickets he sold out of Radio City. 
[00:11:00]  Is this for Radio City?  That's the Radio City show, yeah.  But this has to be happening all over.  All over, or at least in a bunch of other venues.  Charlie Sheen didn't really officially.  Well, he officially sold.  Oh, yeah.  He's making his money.  But when you like that, when you break it down, it's ugly.  It was because I was thinking, why the hell are people paying to see Charlie Sheen?  He sold out that place in like no time, Radio City.  And it's like, fuck, man.  Who wants to see that? 
[00:11:30]  Apparently nobody.  Because ticket brokers scooped up all these fucking tickets.  And now are screaming because they can't sell one of these fucking things to real people.  They can't sell them.  They're putting them on StubHub and on Craigslist trying to sell them at a loss.  They just can't get rid of these fucking things.  I believe for Radio City Music Hall alone, it's, what did you say?  2,800 tickets.  2,800 tickets.  That were just on StubHub that they can't get rid of. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  These fucking brokers thought, we'll scoop them all up, we'll fucking make a fortune selling  them to people because of this Charlie Sheen sensation.  Yeah.  And they can't off these fucking things.  So there's 2,800 online.  That doesn't mean the guys that are still old school that are going to be waiting outside  the venue going, hey, tickets, tickets.  They're trying to get rid of them.  Need tickets?  Yeah.  Need tickets?  It's, uh, people, they, you know, these fucking vulture brokers, though, good, good,  they fucking, they're taking a bath. 
[00:12:30]  But they're kind of stupid.  They really thought the interest would be that high in this?  Yeah.  I think most people realize it was just, just a quick thing.  They didn't count on the tsunami in Japan taking the country's attention completely away  from them.  One of the brokers said, he said, uh, if he heard Charlie Sheen was dead, he'd be happy  because then he'd get a refund on his tickets.  No, is that real?  That's one of the brokers said.  Oh, wow.  They're all just fucking losing a shitload of money.  And, uh, the Plaza, the Plaza Hotel, it's sort of a hotel because I think they sell condos 
[00:13:00]  in there, too.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on in there.  It's like half a hotel and...  Half hotel, half condo.  And half condo.  Full room, half condo.  Breaking news, Sheen's not welcome back there.  Oh.  That's where he had his first, uh, debacle that put him in the public eye.  Yeah, so.  He couldn't sell tickets for his show.  The show.  The show.  Wow, I'm surprised.  I'm surprised.  That's kind of...  I mean, it's a little depressing.  You know, you work hard to sell tickets, then you hear that they just... 
[00:13:30]  No, that's why we wanted to bring that up today for you.  Yeah, it's kind of encouraging.  To kind of show you that, uh, it wasn't what it looked like.  Right.  So.  There's some faith in people.  Yeah.  Very little, but they weren't buying into that fucking drivel.  You want to, uh, you want to get the Obama shit out of the way?  I didn't watch last night.  What are we, out of Libya?  America's out of Libya.  It's a NATO thing now.  That's the headline.  Yeah.  You know what my take is on the whole thing?  Hmm.  I'm exhausted with this.  I don't care anymore. 
[00:14:00]  You don't care?  No, I'm not going to yell.  I'm not going to fucking scream.  I, I, I don't care.  You got it all out last night.  He's, he's the president.  Um, that's it.  I'm, what am I going to say?  You're giving up.  Between Twitter and, and the speech and, I, uh, what more can I do?  I'm not changing anyone's mind.  You're right.  Can't sit there.  You wanted to change people's mind?  No, no, no, I didn't want, but you try to.  That never happens in politics.  You know that.  You don't try to change their mind, but you try, you do try to get kind of a. 
[00:14:30]  Your point across?  That's a good point.  Okay.  Right.  Eh, it just doesn't even work.  You, you, you blurt out a point and it's just, hey, fuck you.  You're an asshole.  You can't have an intelligent discussion about it?  Nah, nah, nah, it's just.  I love your take on this today.  He doesn't work for you, you drunk millionaire.  Uh, yeah, all that fine stuff where it's just, you know what?  I, I've had it.  I, you win.  All he is, you won.  The people that say he doesn't work for you, you drunk millionaire.  Yeah.  You, you beat me, you won. 
[00:15:00]  I concede defeat.  Um, I'm not, I'm not, uh, I'm not yelling anymore.  But even the people that have voted for Obama are not too happy with the situation.  Yeah, let them take up the battle then.  Okay.  I've been in the trenches too long.  Wow.  I'm fucking, I have post-traumatic stress.  This is breaking news.  I, I, I, I, I was preparing for a big, uh, rah, rah, I hate Obama thing today.  No, no.  Hey, he gave his speech.  There were a lot of American flags behind him.  He clenched his fist. 
[00:15:30]  He spoke his piece.  And, uh, and that was that.  You all right?  I've had it.  No, they beat me.  They beat me.  They beat you down.  They beat me down.  Uh, a lot of tweeting last night.  I was watching the speech.  Uh, you don't want them to ever think they got to you.  I can't cover it up.  You can't.  I can't do it anymore.  You know why?  I don't have, I literally don't have it in me anymore to yell and, and, and get all  impassioned and emblazoned about Obama and, and, uh, what he's doing or not doing or who 
[00:16:00]  he's fucking in charge of and, uh, his foreign policy is fucking domestic, but I don't care.  So if I play the, the two highlights from last night's speech, you're just going to sit  there.  I'll, I'll fucking listen.  You're just going to sit there, huh?  I'm going to sit here.  I'm not going to get all fucking.  See, this is what we do for you.  We got, we got, uh, two clips, barely a minute, a little over a minute of, uh, everything you  need to know from the speech last night.  There you go.  That's all.  And you're not going to do anything.  I was, I was, I was shaking over here. 
[00:16:30]  See, a lot of people are thinking, I was shaking over here going, oh boy.  Here he goes.  He's going to, oh, he's going to yell.  No.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Drew Boogie, quick.  Record this.  Get another song.  You're not going to mention the 600 million it cost us for the week in, uh, Libya?  600 million.  What are you doing?  You're trying to get them going?  No, no, no.  I'm making sure.  Are you trying to get them going?  Yeah.  You know what?  They'll just print more money.  Probably.  It's not even real money.  It just turns out to be, it's, it's, it's a number that isn't even tangible.  Even if we played, uh, Barack's going to take Ant's money? 
[00:17:00]  Eh, take it.  What happened to you?  I've had it.  Jesus.  I just, um.  You're supposed to fight the good fight.  No, I, I, I.  People are counting on you, Ant.  I, uh, they got me.  Really?  They got me.  I'm not going to lay disemboweled on a table and yell freedom.  I've had it.  I'll kiss the cuff.  Hit that.  And about me sounding like a white supremacist over the past, uh, week or so.  Since Obama was elected. 
[00:17:30]  Um, I'm seeing things that are happening outside.  I'm experiencing things myself.  This isn't my, uh, uh, imagination.  I am being bullied.  That is just what's happening.  And you know nothing to me.  Come on.  I've been listening on the radio to what's going down on the O&A show.  Obama's got Anthony's tickets in a twist.  Yeah.  Something about the tax and the gun's in the stairs.  Wow.  I'm guessing they're going to take Ant's guns away.  Robbing the rich.  Oh, the black man's vetted down.  That's just crazy. 
[00:18:00]  If you think for a second.  Well, you know why the fuck would I want Anthony's check?  Unless I'm getting a Shelby.  A chicken to smell me.  A sweet radio show.  Yeah, that would sell me.  Am I getting paid?  And I'm going to buy my president now.  That's right.  Rob's going to take Ant's money.  Give it all up today.  Rob's going to take Ant's money.  Give it all up today.  We're going to be moving on.  Rob's going to take Ant's money.  I'm not taking this crap.  Give it all up today.  We're moving on.  We're going to take Ant's money. 
[00:18:30]  Give it all up today.  That's what you do.  You're a high-profile radio coach.  Dude, I can't take this anymore.  I can't take it.  You're now saying that's over.  Who's that guy?  You don't know that guy anymore?  Don't even recognize him anymore.  I'm listening, thinking...  You're scaring us.  Why?  Why?  You want me to call Dr. Steve?  No, you know what?  It's simple.  There's no mystery to this.  I've been...  Do you ever see somebody that's been beaten?  Yeah, you kind of look beaten today. 
[00:19:00]  I've been beaten.  You kind of look like you've had it.  I've had it.  I can't carry on this fight.  What finally happened?  It was just a culmination of all the tweeting, and I think there's too much social media involved,  and messages on PalTalk and the compound and everything.  It's just all just...  And I'm supposed to jump in 25 different directions at once, trying to hold off this guy, 
[00:19:30]  and he's commenting, and this guy's just hating, and this guy's got a valid point,  but it's not what I do, and I'm trying to retweet in so many characters,  and then this guy's over here fucking just calling me a fucking racist,  and then this guy's fucking saying I rule, and then...  You know what?  I just don't...  I thought you liked the sport of the whole thing.  Not anymore, huh?  No, I'm battle-weary.  I'm battle-weary.  I just...  I'm just going to sit at home and...  Is this a bit? 
[00:20:00]  This is a bit, right?  No, no.  It's a bit.  You've wasted a lot of energy, if I feel.  You should be enjoying life.  That's...  I think that's it.  He lives in a mansion, and instead of enjoying himself, he's screaming.  I'm hunched over a computer, or I'm fucking...  My thumb is going mad on the phone, and I'm trying to figure out how to outwit somebody  in a retweet while retaining the fucking tweet that he did, yet getting my point across. 
[00:20:30]  Maybe you're multitasking too much.  Exhausting.  You got the drinking, the tweeting, the video, the audio...  It's...  Well, something had to give...  The texting.  You got too much multitasking going on.  It's just...  Well, I had to...  I think your brain might have exploded.  I had to give up the Obama thing.  Chris from Jersey, you were my hero, Anthony.  And then he just writes, pussy.  Yep.  In big letters with a lot of Ys.  That's never good.  I'm sorry.  I...  I like this new character.  This is fun.  I'm giving up on the fight.  You didn't tell us you were doing a new character today. 
[00:21:00]  This is a character.  I'm giving up on the fight.  This is a character, right?  No, it's really not.  Like Mr. Imus?  Like Mr. Imus does characters.  Let me take you down to meet Mr. Imus.  All right, well...  Dude, he doesn't sleep.  Fuck off.  After he's sleeping, his eyes close while he's holding wine on a couch.  Yes.  And he's just had enough.  That's enough.  And then that's...  Oh, God.  More?  Danny?  Too much yelling, bro.  I knew you farted because you leaned over and fixed my mic.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Oh, I skipped that.  He wafted over there?  That was completely legitimate.  All right. 
[00:21:30]  Well, why don't we do the two...  Although that is a great guy.  I should do that.  That is good.  It'll waft over.  Let's do the two highlights from Obama's speech because we're out of Libya now.  And you're not going to say anything.  No.  I certainly have nothing to say.  I'll listen.  Maybe a quick comment like anybody else would give that isn't really...  Like just basic shit?  ...too passionate on one side or the other?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to figure you out.  Really?  I think this is a bit...  There's no way you're giving up this fight.  I have to.  But politics, like I've said, you just can't change anyone's mind. 
[00:22:00]  That's why it's so frustrating.  That's why it was...  It's just a quagmire you end up in.  Yeah.  A no-win scenario.  A Kobayashi Maru.  That's why I'm done with...  That's what it is.  That's why I'm done with radio battles.  Let's go around the room.  Because you can't change anyone.  You can't.  I'm too old and exhausted to fight with all these other radio shows.  I'm done.  Unless you change the program and cheat, you cannot rescue the Kobayashi Maru while not  getting killed by the Klingons. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  I'm not going to sit here in the captain's seat anymore and try to rescue that ship.  Right.  And I'm done with radio battles.  Take it.  I've talked to just about every member of the Howard Stern Show.  I'm fine with every single person.  And a two-minute conversation with a big guy, and that's it.  And I'll have that conversation any time he wants.  I'm done.  It's just, it doesn't matter anymore.  He could check me for weapons before we talk.  It's...  I'm done.  Ronnie could drag me into the limo.  We'll have one of those weird mafia fucking meetings in the back of the limo.  Two minutes.  That's it. 
[00:23:00]  That's it?  That's it.  That's what it comes down to.  We take the elevator with those guys every day.  I know.  They can't be nicer.  What am I supposed to do?  I know.  How are you...  That's stupid.  Baba wrote me the other day.  What did he say?  I think it's time we talk.  Really?  I might even talk to him.  A sit-down?  I don't know.  A parlay?  I'm just getting too fucking old for this shit.  I love...  I'm so glad you brought this to the show today, because now I'm starting to believe you.  Fuck it all.  It's just exhausting.  We're not even going to be here in a year. 
[00:23:30]  Everyone knows that.  And time-consuming, and it's just fucking crazy.  Ah, I can't take it.  Jimmy, you want to confess anything today?  Your love of trannies, we know that, so you've got to leave that off the table.  Shit.  Got anything?  I'm sick of pretending I don't know.  No, I would say...  Fuck, Jimmy. 
[00:24:00]  No, I like this.  Why?  I like this.  This is a bit, though.  No, no, I don't know if it is.  No, no.  You and his...  It's good for today, but he'll be back.  He just needs a good night's sleep, and we're heading towards some kind of vacation.  I've had it.  No, I don't believe you.  No, I can't be bothered trying so hard.  He's black, though.  You can't let that go.  Hey, you know, it's a different time.  I'm not even going to...  This is not happening. 
[00:24:30]  What am I going to do?  It's a different time, a different place.  It's like in 2011.  What am I supposed to do?  Retain this internal hatred for the rest of my life?  Just, I don't have the energy.  Because you keep waiting for the day...  It takes too much.  ...where you'll be right.  Like, where all the facts will be out, and every base will have been covered, and the  ultimate day of being right happens.  Yeah.  And it never comes.  Right.  So, when Obama's out, it's just going to start all over with the other guy. 
[00:25:00]  And then everyone just switches sides, I think.  There'll be a new guy.  But then, you know what?  It never ends.  Yeah.  It just doesn't.  You're right.  No one that ends is when the country splits.  Civil war?  I don't know.  Does it become a civil war?  Whatever.  I'm so confused.  I'm just...  17 years, I don't know what's going on.  I, uh...  No, I've just...  I've reached the point where...  Why am I... 
[00:25:30]  Why am I putting so much energy into trying to get a point across to people?  Yeah, but we all were counting on you to start your political talk show career.  You could be that rah-rah guy.  You could be...  You could be way better than Glenn Beck.  You could be way better than most of them.  Am I just going to making commercials or something?  Making commercials?  Eh, it seems fun.  I don't know.  It's safe.  No real...  No real controversy there. 
[00:26:00]  Let's just enjoy...  No wars.  Let's just enjoy our last year and a half to go.  That's it.  Let's just enjoy ourselves.  Just...  No more bitching.  No more complaining.  No.  No.  I'm actually going to go into a meeting after work and...  Just sit there?  And just sit there and listen.  I'm not going to fall asleep.  I'm not going to...  And hear a bunch of...  I'm not going to argue any points.  And hear a bunch of bullshit that'll never happen.  And then we're going to have to be dragged into that other fucking guy's office.  And that ain't happening today.  All right.  Hey.  I'm not new.  Hey, calm down. 
[00:26:30]  That's where my line is.  Hey, you could...  Don't make me go into that office and have an anxiety attack with a guy that fucking  just stares at us and makes believe he gives a fuck about us and our show.  Don't do that to me today.  Come on.  The other meeting I could do...  Yeah.  Because I feel like he's on our side, but...  What could he do?  But don't drag us into that other fucking office.  Yeah.  Please don't do that to me today.  Please don't do that.  No, I want to get right out after the meeting. 
[00:27:00]  How do we get to his office without going past the other office?  I ain't fucking going in.  Mm-mm.  Not today, man.  No.  Not today.  Very busy.  Time for one meeting.  Obama's, um...  You have a meeting today?  Yeah.  I gotta breathe.  You want in?  No.  Got a meeting.  With me?  I can't.  Yeah, I can't do it either today.  I just realized.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I got something today.  Oh, I'll take the reins.  It's okay.  You gonna take it?  Yeah, why not?  How about...  Yeah, you take this one.  I'll just sit there.  I'll text you later and let you know what was said. 
[00:27:30]  I'll find out what's really going on when these mics are off, because this is really weird today.  No, no.  Just...  This is weird.  Just...  All right, here's Obama.  We're out of Libya.  Here's the highlights from...  How long was he on yesterday?  An hour?  Not long enough, Hope.  Were you doing a...  Yeah, I was doing a simulcast.  No, I already know that, but I'm doing it for the radio audience.  Oh, right.  Yeah, I was doing a little simulcast from the basement.  Yeah.  And played the speech, was yapping over it.  That's another point that I was just kind of like that.  But I'm confused because I think, especially the people that are big fans of what you do, 
[00:28:00]  they would be more on your side than against you.  So I'm really confused why it was such a battle last night.  If what you're telling me is true.  All the tweets.  I would assume that most people would be like, yeah, rah, rah, eh.  Well, yeah, you get plenty of those, but you just can't offset the miserable people out there.  There's a lot of miserable people.  Just tweeting miserable things.  And they've never really done anything creative in their lives, but... 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  They're going to knock everyone down that does creative things.  And then I just look at my tweets and realize, there I go.  Really?  There's me in the mirror.  Really?  I'm starting with the man in the mirror.  Really?  That's my policy.  One guy actually tweeted me yesterday.  I kind of laughed, but it was a truth bomb.  He goes, do you ever get tired of being negative about everything?  Yeah.  And I went, you know what?  I think today is nothing but positive tweets for me. 
[00:29:00]  It's so exhausting.  I'm going to talk about all the stuff I see popping out of the ground because spring is here.  To just be angry all the time.  It's work.  I'm not even angry all the time.  My biggest issue is I know how big this show could be, and we're getting no fucking help whatsoever.  And the listeners will go, well, enough of the bitching.  But this is how you try to get things done?  Because I don't know how else to do it.  I really don't. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, I know.  And that's why I'm frustrated.  I actually tweeted, Facebooked, whatever you want to call it, pictures of our banner that was hanging off the side of Madison Square Garden yesterday.  I remember that.  I was going through old pictures, and I went home so frustrated about this intern thing.  Like, we're to the point we're not even allowed to have interns anymore.  And I want to shake these guys.  Do you realize where we were and where we could still be today?  And then I just happened to find those pictures yesterday.  I wasn't even searching them out.  I was looking for something else.  I went, you know what, I've got to push this out to the people today. 
[00:30:00]  And then I even wrote, like, this is where we were, and now today we can't even have interns.  And that's where all the frustration comes from.  If people would ask me instead of just going, enough of the bitching, you know, I know what this show could be.  I know we do a very good show every day.  I have no doubt about that.  Yeah.  But you need the help from the company and the people around you to actually push you to that next level.  How about just having it staffed with the interns?  Yeah.  Well, that's what it's gotten down to.  You know, and then we got guys that run the channel that have no business running our channel. 
[00:30:30]  I mean, they're nice guys.  I like them as people, and I want them to know that.  But we've worked with the best in the business.  You're not even close to that.  They try, Opian.  Isn't that enough?  Yeah, but I don't, I've been doing this since I was 18.  I don't feel like, you know, bringing other people up.  Yeah.  You know, they're supposed to have enough knowledge to see what we do and push it forward like Eric Logan did.  These guys don't know.  And I'm not talking about Steve.  Steve does know, but then unfortunately he took on more responsibility with the company, 
[00:31:00]  so he can't really, you know, help us as much as he was a mere year ago or so.  Yeah.  And the two guys that he decided to bring up to run the channel, they just suck at this.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  If we're being honest today, you know?  You're going to get the looks now when they come down the hall later.  I don't care.  They know it.  They know it.  They're trying to hold on for dear life.  I would suggest they just go back to, you know, programming music and we'll be fine by ourselves.  It's the same fucking thing.  Don't say anything that's going to make the meeting longer. 
[00:31:30]  Nah, I think Steve even knows.  Oh, Jesus.  Dude, you better shut me up because I think Steve even knows.  But what is he going to do?  There's no one else here, really.  Because then the question is, well, who would you want to help with the channel?  What would your answer be?  I don't have any answers anymore.  I don't even have an answer.  Are there names out there anymore?  Oh, yeah.  I know the company.  What job are they in?  I know the company frowns when you're honest, so I should shut up. 
[00:32:00]  They get really bummed.  Honesty is not good.  Not the policy.  Well, it's the intern thing that's almost busting me.  I'm just like, really?  It's gotten to the point where we're having meetings and our agent get involved to try to get interns back.  And the only thing they can tell us is it's complicated.  How is it complicated?  We should have interns.  My thought is something happened.  I don't know what we're allowed to say.  Yeah.  So I'm trying to be cool about that. 
[00:32:30]  There was something that happened.  All hell broke loose and there were closed door meetings with a whole bunch of fucking people.  They decide what they wanted to do.  And they punished some people, okay?  So there was a punishment.  The punishment is officially over.  So the incident is officially behind us.  So now my question, and I can't get an answer to it, is why are we still being punished and not allowed to have interns?  Like the ex-con that can't get another job after prison. 
[00:33:00]  We're not being given a chance.  But on top of it, me, you, and Jimmy, and all the guys, but the three main faces of the show, we had nothing to do with the incident to begin with.  So now you're hurting us and hurting your product because it's your company.  Load.  So, you know.  What a load of shite.  And then we walk down the hall, we'll have that meeting, then we'll be dragged into the corner office, and he'll be like all about, what can I do for you?  Can't go in that office.  What can I do for you?  And once again, I'll have that really uncomfortable meeting with him because he knows I have a problem. 
[00:33:30]  I'm not going.  I'm not going to that office.  Fuck no.  I have time for one meeting today.  All right.  That's it.  All right, let's do the Obama thing.  Yeah, let's hear.  Here's the two highlights from last night's Obama speech.  Right.  Just as there are those who've argued against intervention in Libya, there are others who've suggested that we broaden our military mission beyond the task of protecting the Libyan people  and do whatever it takes to bring down Gaddafi and usher in a new government. 
[00:34:00]  Of course, there is no question that Libya and the world would be better off with Gaddafi out of power.  I, along with many other world leaders, have embraced that goal and will actively pursue it through non-military means.  But broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake.  Anything yet? 
[00:34:30]  He said it all.  Isn't it kind of, it is regime change if Gaddafi comes out, though.  I mean, that pretty much is regime change.  Is it?  Yeah, I think so.  And who would have brought that about?  No, but he was saying it's like bringing Gaddafi out is, uh, he doesn't want to do regime change, but he's getting Gaddafi.  I'm saying it's kind of the same thing.  Right.  This is good.  So they would be responsible for regime change.  This is good.  I see it.  What?  I see.  The turn.  This is a wrestling thing.  No, no, no, no, no.  You got everyone convinced that you don't, but now here we go.  No, no. 
[00:35:00]  I just listened to that.  Go ahead.  And I, I'm just trying to figure, I'm just puzzled about a couple of things.  That's all.  I'm not going to yell and scream.  He's the president.  I assume, um, the president of the United States with all of his advisors and, uh, international community and everything would know a lot more than, and a wacky radio guy.  So who am I to say?  Yeah.  Who am I to say?  All right.  That's it?  Yeah.  See what else he says.  You don't think we should go in and get, you know, complete the job? 
[00:35:30]  What's the job?  Get him the fuck out.  Then what?  Who's in charge?  That's a good point.  I don't even think they know who's in charge in Egypt at this point.  Who are these rebel guys?  Very good point.  Well, we're protecting them.  I mean, and this is a humanitarian thing.  This was just the, the sole reason for going in.  To help out the rebels a little bit.  No.  No.  It was humanitarian.  Well, that's bullshit. 
[00:36:00]  Because Gaddafi was killing people that were shooting at him and his army.  Right.  See what happened there?  Uh-huh.  See?  See, it's humanitarian when you're, you're going in.  So, and there are.  Now you're going to be sarcastic guy.  No, no.  This is exactly what I don't understand.  I'm puzzled by it, but I'm not going to go crazy over it.  Okay.  See, Gaddafi was poised to kill a lot of people. 
[00:36:30]  The people he was killing were those people shooting at his planes and shooting at his buildings and his army.  And he was shooting them to kill them.  Because he is the leader of the country.  But then Obama and France and England and a couple other places decided that we have to protect the people from being killed.  Right. 
[00:37:00]  And by protecting those people, you're protecting what amounts to the other army.  So isn't that a military operation and not a humanitarian operation?  I would, I would have to say yes.  That's just my opinion.  It's just one man's opinion.  My favorite part of this whole thing with the Libyan thing.  If, if we did anything like that in America, you think they would allow that?  And we're supposed to be this free country?  What if a bunch of people go, look, I, you know, I'm sick of paying all the taxes I'm paying. 
[00:37:30]  I'm going to rally the troops and we're going to, we're going to have a little revolution, uh, revolution, excuse me, in, in America.  Do you think, do you think it would go as well as it did in Egypt and possibly as well as it might, uh, do you think Obama would say it's just the people exercising their right?  And, and he would welcome in any other country or countries that would, that would help out the resistance.  It's all bullshit in the end.  It's just bullshit because, because he would say in the government would say, no, we know better. 
[00:38:00]  This is, we need this type of a system in place, but wait, the people want to, uh, you know, revolt.  It's like, look, they've, the people have picked up arms, right?  And they're shooting at the American military on the United States soil, trying to remove the president.  Right.  And then the, the president gets his army and says, you got to squash this.  Right.  So kill those people that are shooting at us. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  And then another country goes, Hey, Hey, right.  You're killing people.  Right.  They're killing their own people.  Right.  Let's send some troops over and some planes and bomb the army.  That's killing the people, even though the people are shooting at, at the army and trying to get rid of the guy in charge.  Exactly.  I don't know, but.  That's why it's, it's ridiculous to me.  So I listen.  There's enough people in this country that are not happy with the system.  Right.  So if they rise up, it'll be just like an Egypt thing. 
[00:39:00]  Imagine if we'll be out there just rah, rah and happy for the people.  And do you think we'd be friendly with a country that would come in and help?  No.  See, it, it doesn't work, but what am I going to do?  Yell.  It's all bull.  Oh boy.  Here's the second clip from the Obama speech.  We have intervened to stop a massacre.  And we will work with our allies and partners to maintain the safety of civilians.  Civilians.  We will deny the regime arms, cut off its supplies of cash, assist the opposition, and work with other nations to hasten the day when Gaddafi leaves power. 
[00:39:30]  Well, that's helping the civilians.  It may not happen overnight, as a badly weakened Gaddafi tries desperately to hang on to power.  Yeah.  But it should be clear to those around Gaddafi and to every Libyan that history is not on Gaddafi's side.  Look, I know I mess up some words and I mispronounce stuff, but I hate how he says Gaddafi. 
[00:40:00]  Gaddafi.  It's the Gaddafi.  Is that how it is?  Isn't it?  Jonathan told me one of the reasons they had trouble tracing his money is because there's so many different spellings of his name.  They don't know how to spell his fucking name.  He'd have to pronounce it.  Yeah.  I think Gaddafi, I'm sure Obama probably has the correctest.  Gaddafi.  Yeah.  I'm sure somebody told him how to say it.  Shouldn't he say that G a little more?  If you're going to spell it that way.  How do you spell it?  I go with the Q.  I go Gaddafi.  I go Gaddafi, too.  So why is he going Gaddafi? 
[00:40:30]  Some people say it differently.  You know why?  You can't spell like the translation.  It's a sound.  It's just a sound that's made.  Gaddafi.  It's Gaddafi.  Gaddafi.  And with English spelling, you could spell it numerous ways based on the sound.  Is it a K?  Is it a G?  Is it a K?  Is it a G?  And Gaddafi was around when Reagan was around.  Gaddafi.  Yeah.  That is fucked up.  I know.  Because I was a little kid when Reagan was around.  Yeah.  He was around.  That's so fucking weird to think.  He ran his country.  He, you know, however he ran, it's his fucking business if you ask me. 
[00:41:00]  You know what?  We got to literally put the brakes on this because Danny McBride's here and we should  definitely take a little bit of a break.  I got to go wee-wee.  We got him up to an hour if it goes well.  Kool-Aid.  He's promoting his new movie that so far, man, the people that have seen it are loving this movie.  They're digging it.  And, uh, and fucking McBride's a stand-up guy.  Yeah.  He hasn't forgotten about us.  Well, we'll see.  We had him when he was a little nothing.  I know.  And now look at him.  A big star.  A big star. 
[00:41:30]  Danny McBride next.  We'll get back into the Obama thing and this weird Anthony that's sitting here today.  It's just...  A little later.  But first this.  This could mean only one thing. 
[00:42:00]  Danny McBride in studio.  Yes.  What's up, Danny?  How are you, brother?  Not too much.  Thank you guys for having me back here.  We just, we just, uh, we just did the best part of the interview before we came back.  That's why we...  I gotta explain.  We're all big fans of yours.  So we were like, yeah, get him in right away.  And then you just burned out some of your best material.  That's why we like to have the guests outside the studio.  And come in like...  Come in.  When we're like, hey, we're on the air.  Come on in.  Come in hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, don't worry.  It'll be fine. 
[00:42:30]  I was telling Danny that So Far Sam was the only one that got to see the new movie, Your Highness.  And he loves it.  He says this movie is dirty and really funny.  Yes.  We are surprised that we were able to get away with this film.  It is a, uh...  It's a throwback to those movies from the late 70s, early 80s.  Those crazy fantasy movies like Beastmaster, Kroll, Dragonslayer.  And, uh, you know, we saw those movies.  And now you have these modern fantasy films like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and  what's missing from those movies?  Marijuana? 
[00:43:00]  Tits?  Ass?  Tons of cuss words?  That's what we've done with Your Highness.  And possibly a hard-on.  Yes.  Yeah.  And we have a Minotaur hard-on in the film.  It's never been captured on film before.  Wow.  Yeah.  And it's full hard.  Full hard.  You see it.  There's a rape scene with a Minotaur and a man.  And you see, you see the Minotaur get his shit going.  This movie's gonna do it.  How did you do that in an automobile, though?  Yeah, well, you apparently can't show a male hard-on.  So since this was a Minotaur, we said it was the bull. 
[00:43:30]  The bull was what was getting turned on.  Ah, because it's that bottom half.  Yes, exactly.  Ah, very clever.  Yeah, so you can get by that with creature hard-ons.  And the, uh, the ratings board said that's fine.  They said it's fine.  They said it was cool.  And, uh, yeah, they're hoping that more movies do this and start doing, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Wall Street 2 tried it, but it didn't work.  And they cut it out.  So bestiality is good.  Yeah, it's a big hit with the kids.  But just no boners. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  That's lawyer stuff for you, man.  That's great.  Hey, whatever makes sense, but whatever.  Whatever worked.  And abundance of, uh, tits?  Lots of tits in this film, yes.  Lots of blood.  Lots of sword play.  Oh, good.  I mean, it's basically everything you'd want to see when you were 12 years old in the film.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, is still the same thing you want to see when you're an adult.  Yeah.  It's like, when I was a kid, I used to always watch these R-rated movies when my parents would  go to bed through the scrambled cable signal.  You know, we thought about putting that scrambled signal on the movie the whole time when the 
[00:44:30]  audience has to kind of move to see the tits.  A little frustrated, yet you're seeing something.  I remember doing that, man.  Remember the X-rated channel?  And it would just pop on crystal clear for one second, and that's all you needed.  And then you would wait for another second eventually to pop on.  And then you'd get pissed because sometimes it would pop on while the guy's face was in  close-up going, oh!  Like, no!  Why then?  They didn't really have the scramble figured out perfectly.  No.  And he used to be able to... 
[00:45:00]  Or if you were able to hold down the buttons a certain way.  Do you remember?  This is bringing back some memories.  On the old TV I had, you had the little ring around the channel changer.  So what you'd do is, it had to be on channel three.  The cable box just had one switch.  It flipped over to Cinema 100, and it had a key.  It was like, fucking, turn your key, sir.  Sure.  And then you got adult movies sometimes late at night.  And if you twisted the little tuning knob around the channel changer one way, and just  kept going and going, it would clear it up a little bit. 
[00:45:30]  I had a friend, John Ewan, one of my best friends of all time, even though I haven't  seen him in 20 years.  He hot-wired one of those boxes at 15 years old and brought it over.  He must have been the shit.  And we would switch out my parents' cable box for his and just hang out upstairs and  watch fucking X-rated flicks.  And they had no idea.  That's incredible.  Yeah, yeah, that is.  To a kid, that's just like the best fucking thing.  But he figured out at 15 or 16.  Because I hot-wired it.  We'll switch it out for a couple hours, check out some shit. 
[00:46:00]  Both of you sitting there with your young erections, looking at each other.  Look what you've done.  Back then, if you were able to watch porn, you'd watch it with whoever.  Absolutely.  Whatever.  Dude, I snuck off many times and jacked in my friend's bathroom.  Oh, my God.  It's not like today where it's everywhere.  I mean, it was one place to go.  Yeah, now you just go online and get anything.  Did you, Jack, I used to love the Emanuel movies.  Remember those, like the Cinemax movie, Emanuel?  The window watch, the confessions of, we're trying to be funny, but I would always jack 
[00:46:30]  to the, Black Emanuel was my favorite.  Really?  Black Emanuel.  Yeah.  One of the, I went to film school and one of my teachers there, he was a cinematography  teacher, he shot Emanuel Six.  Wow.  Yeah, we had the most respect for him at a moment.  Of course.  No doubt.  No doubt.  Was Laura Gemzer in that one or was there another Emanuel?  I only know them by their tits.  I don't know their names.  Yeah, that's, Danny, he knows everybody in the industry.  Well, you should.  He'll bring up names.  You're like, how do you know this stuff?  There was a movie when I was growing up, it was called, and we talked about it on this 
[00:47:00]  show a couple of times, it's called Cheerleaders, and it was, the whole gist of this movie was,  you know, the high school football team was going to play another high school football  team, and they got a great idea that the cheerleaders for this one team would go over and fuck  the shit out of the other football team so they couldn't play.  Brilliant.  Yeah, because of course you can't play after that, right?  No, of course not.  And it was full of the most hairy bushes I've ever seen in a movie, ever. 
[00:47:30]  Ever.  1973 that was made.  Oh my God.  And I guess I saw it probably in 78.  Wow.  Something like that, and was just like, this is great.  Look at the big hairy bush that is so attractive to us now in this day and age, but won't be  soon.  No.  Only porn stars shave, and it looks weird.  It's all about...  It looks like a great movie.  Dude, it was all about sex.  And I think this was the movie with the guy that goes, well, what have we got here? 
[00:48:00]  Because I think the father was at the house that the other football team was at, and one  of the girls went into the room and had sex with the father.  Well, no.  Oh, wow.  In the middle of the night, the father's watching TV, and the little cheerleader comes down  for a little snack.  Great stuff.  Do you have...  And then does the father.  Is there a bush in your movie?  I mean, there's obviously a new...  Are they shaved?  There is a...  Is there a bush?  We have ass, tits.  There's no bush in the movie, unfortunately.  As long as there's penis.  No, I'm just wondering...  We got dick in. 
[00:48:30]  You don't want to push it.  You win our appetite with that.  That's funny.  Once you get cocked, you shouldn't get greedy.  Why have a bush when you have a cock, right?  That pesky vagina is going to get in trouble.  Yeah, really.  I really am just looking for everything.  This fucking movie looks like it's going to be great.  When is it open?  Next Friday, huh?  Yep, next Friday.  April 8th.  Yep.  And like you said, that whole old world kind of sword fight.  You know, dragons, things like that? 
[00:49:00]  Yes, that evil wizard.  You know, in it, Justin Theroux plays this evil sorcerer  who basically kidnaps James Franco's bride-to-be,  Zooey Deschanel.  And Theroux's character, he's this evil wizard  who's been raised by three witches  to fulfill this prophecy called the fuckening,  where he has to fuck a virgin under the eclipse of the two moons.  It's very...  Yeah, it's historically accurate.  Yeah, it sounds...  That's great.  As long as he's stuck to history accurately.  How are you going to sell this on mainstream media? 
[00:49:30]  To children.  We're selling it.  We're marketing it to children.  See, you're here at the SiriusXM where you're cursed,  but I don't know how you're going to sell this anymore.  The trailer is literally like five seconds long  because we can't put any of the great stuff in the middle.  It looks funny, but I didn't get the impression  that it was filthy from the trailer.  I just...  It's funny how that happens.  Yeah.  Filthy.  What are they doing in the shower here?  I don't know.  I'm watching a clip of the cheerleaders movie.  It looks like they're trying to rape a bitch in the shower.  Yeah, I think they are.  It's just...  Oh, they're succeeding.  Yeah.  It's a whole football team.  It kind of looks like... 
[00:50:00]  There's a pole in the middle.  It's like the safety dance video.  She's being raped.  See, she went in to take a shower  while the guys weren't there.  Believe me like that?  That's it.  That's how it ends.  Left you hanging.  And five guys with hair like Bruce Jenner  falling into a sexually assault her.  They all got the dry look from Gillette.  Oh, what do we got here?  Well...  Oh, no.  What do we got here?  Is this cheerleaders, Tim?  Oh, on the exercise bike.  We later saw this in Porky's, I believe, upstairs in the gymnasium. 
[00:50:30]  Phantom of the Opera music.  That's nice.  Perfect.  Look at that.  Just two hairy snatches rubbing together.  You know it.  Yeah.  One bike without a seat.  They're on an exercise bike, apparently.  I don't know.  I just...  There's just something about porn, huh?  They just ruin porn.  It used to be like this.  It used to be silly.  It used to be so hard to get your hands on it when you were a kid, though.  Now you can just go on the internet.  It's there.  In my neighborhood, when I was a kid, there was an old shack in the woods, and there was  a wet, like, mildewed, black tail magazine that a thousand kids had jerked off to. 
[00:51:00]  But we'd have to ride our bikes through the forest to go find and take turns going into  the shed to look at it and come out.  It was like the public jerk-off library.  Yeah.  It was just one book.  Yeah, one book.  Every neighborhood had that one fucking magazine that was in the woods, and you just knew  where it was.  Yeah.  I feel like there were...  That's like Johnny Applesey would go around and plant the apples.  Yeah, yeah.  Some pervert would go around and plant a porno mag in every neighborhood.  Knowing the kids are going in there.  He'd go in and just smell around when they were gone.  Do you remember the smell of those magazines? 
[00:51:30]  They had a weird smell.  Those pages, man.  It was called cum.  It's like kind of like chlorine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's something odd about that.  Yeah, there really was no way for me to salvage that once I said it.  You've got to think the perv was in the tree the whole time.  Yeah.  The guy that planted the fucking magazines, and then he probably just hung out in a tree.  Well, you know there weren't cameras back then.  No, so...  Something like that.  He had to fucking check it out.  God, it's so easy these days.  God, you just don't...  You want these kids to appreciate the porno they have in this day and age. 
[00:52:00]  I remember the Pia Zadora issue of Wii.  Oh, God.  I used to steal them with a screwdriver out of a magazine.  There's a vending machine in the hotel.  I would steal Playboy, Penthouse, and Wii every...  Young thug.  Every fucking month, I would steal the brand new one.  Were you ever worried about getting caught stealing smut?  No, I would eat food off the trays, too.  They were like a comfort, but they had room service.  And I would be drunk, and I would just go and eat food off the trays outside the rooms.  And then jerk off some magazines I stole. 
[00:52:30]  You were seven?  Seven years old?  I think I was a young teen by this.  A young teen just finding myself curious about this strange thing.  That's a great gimmick down there back then.  Yeah, sure.  Good for you.  See, Danny, you got us started with this whole thing.  What's wrong with her tits?  Look at that.  It's big and heavy.  Nothing wrong with them.  Lead balloons.  Yeah, that's all.  Horrible.  That does look like the kind of woods that looks like the tree that fucking raped a girl  at Evil Dead.  People can play along. 
[00:53:00]  Go to porninthewoods.net, and it's basically just a picture of the woods, and you have to  try to find the porn in the woods.  No way.  That's awesome.  It brings you right back.  No way.  Yeah, look.  That's all it is.  Look, and they've got to find all the porn.  Let's see.  Is that porn right there?  No.  That's just a used condom.  I found porn.  Oh, did you?  Let's see what you...  Boom!  There we are.  And it's old school shit, too.  Yeah, it's completely old school.  Oh, shit.  And even the pages are fucked up.  Yeah.  Yeah, look.  They're all crinkled.  They've thought of everything.  Look at that.  What's better than seeing a girl suck a guy's dick at his mutton chops? 
[00:53:30]  How fucking great are mutton...  That's old school.  That's fucking old school, man.  She's got one big mutton chop on her lap.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, well, now you're talking.  Now you're talking.  That needs to go to the gas station.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Pfft.  Ever since we're going old school, when was the last time any air thing made that sound?  Ah, shit.  We suck. 
[00:54:00]  Just because we got to promote Your Highness a little bit, because he's not going to be  able to promote this anywhere else, it seems.  No.  Only here.  You got James Franco?  James Franco.  Natalie Portman.  Yeah.  Yeah, Zooey Deschanel.  This is the movie they did right before they went off and gave their Academy Award-winning  performances.  Uh-huh.  So I feel like, you know, Franco acted with a rock for 127 hours.  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.  So I think I was the warm-up for that.  I was his rock in this film.  You know, I hated, what was it, Date Night? 
[00:54:30]  Was that the Steve Carell movie?  Oh, yeah.  Date Night, yeah.  But Franco was in that.  He was good.  Yeah.  I liked him in that movie.  I think he's a good actor.  He is.  He's a funny dude.  He is a really funny dude.  Yeah.  Yeah, Pineapple Express.  Pineapple Express, of course, yeah.  But you, uh, so it doesn't hurt to have a couple of people that were up for Oscars  in your movie.  You mean legitimate actors, yes.  Right.  I was trying to be here.  Okay, I can help you out a little bit more.  Yes.  Legitimate actors, respected.  You're just used to, what, acting with goofballs in general? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, export stars, yes.  Right.  I know that's the thing that's hilarious about Franco is, you know, after the Academy Awards  and after Pineapple Express, people think Franco is some burnout, that he just smokes weed all  the time.  And he actually is probably the most straight-edged dude I've ever met before.  Really?  He doesn't drink.  He doesn't smoke.  When we were shooting this movie, we shot it in Belfast in Northern Ireland.  He was enrolled in school in New York.  And there was a teacher who was telling him, like, if you don't come to class on Tuesdays,  I'm dropping you from the class.  You have to be here in person. 
[00:55:30]  You can't send an assistant.  So every day when we'd finish shooting Monday nights, he would hop on a plane, fly from  Belfast to New York, go straight to class, go to class, leave class, get back on a plane,  fly back to Belfast, go back to work.  What was the class?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Jesus.  Film, probably.  Yeah, acting.  It was calculus.  Wait, wasn't it?  Isn't he teaching something at the, but don't you go to college to have a great career?  And if you already have the great career, why are you doing college?  Why bother?  I don't understand that ever.  Education is very important to this man.  Education sucks. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, really.  I love being a high school dropout.  I'm pulling in fucking 45 G's a year with no help from college.  This room says a lot.  High school dropout, high school dropout, college graduate, and I'm the dumbest in the  room.  Oh.  So what does that say right there?  Which college did you go to?  Oh, Geneseo.  Little state school.  Yeah, that's the equivalent of high school dropout.  Yeah, it really is.  It was known as a drinking school when it went, but now they call it the Ivy League of the  East or some dumb fucking thing.  But they already have the Ivy League of the East. 
[00:56:30]  Try to pump it up.  Or the Little Ivy League.  They have some weird nickname to try to get people, you know.  Little Ivy League would probably pull people in, right?  Yeah, that'll do it.  I forgot what it is.  Little Ivy League.  Sounds very gay.  Make it sound better than it is.  How is Natalie Portman?  I love her.  Yeah.  She was awesome.  You know, this script is so just filthy and raunchy that when I found out she wanted to  be involved with it, we had to send her the script and I was almost kind of embarrassed  to send it to her because it was just so raw.  Yeah.  I was like, should we take all this dirty shit out before we give it to her? 
[00:57:00]  And the director was like, no, let's just let her know what she's in for.  And she did not shy away from any of the dirty stuff.  She could hang.  That's something.  She doesn't come across as that.  Well, you're not sending it to her right before she did the professional.  I mean, you're fine.  Yeah, yeah, that's her.  We sent it to her when she was 11.  Her hottest movie, by the way.  Did she get pregnant on your set?  Right after our set, yeah.  Is she pregnant?  Oh, yeah, she is.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Well, you don't like that, right?  Nah, it's like you like to always think you have a shot.  I was going to talk about Natalie Portman. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  I would have met her.  I was like, it's funny.  Lincoln Center is not far from my apartment.  Oh, that's true.  Like, that would have been our basis of conversation.  From the Black Swan.  Yeah.  She was great.  It's funny to say she didn't do all the dancing in that.  It's like, who gives a shit?  Well, now they're saying she did 80%.  They came out today because now they're trying to fucking argue.  But it doesn't even matter to me.  Who fucking cares?  You tell me there wasn't a real monkey that climbed the building in King Kong?  I know.  It's a movie.  She was great.  I know.  Her acting was great, and she deserved the Oscar.  Who fucking cares?  Wow. 
[00:58:00]  Pretty lame for that girl to come out and do that, I think.  Exactly.  It's like, you accept the job as a hand model.  Don't fucking complain that you're not getting all the attention.  Yeah.  You took the gig.  The girl who did some of the stunt dancing.  Yeah.  That was your gig.  What was the hard stuff she did, I wonder?  If Natalie Portman did 80%, then the 20% must have been like a real bitch.  That was when the wings sprouted from her back.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was during the Cab Calloway thing when she did the Mini the Moocher.  That was not Natalie Portman.  Good, good, good.  I had applied to be Natalie's stunt double during the scene with her and Mila Kunis. 
[00:58:30]  I applied.  Oh, yeah.  That would have been a good one.  I wasn't a perfect body match, unfortunately.  Yeah, that would have been a good one.  Boy, did she play a fucking kook in that.  She was great.  I still haven't seen it.  That's like every chick that wants to fuck me thinks like, is that nuts?  Crazy.  Is that a crazy bitch?  Is that a movie guys are supposed to see?  Because I still haven't seen it.  It was so good.  It was shot uncomfortably close up.  It was really great, man.  I thought it was going to be a chick flick.  Yeah.  And then I was watching it and I'm going, oh, okay, this isn't a chick flick. 
[00:59:00]  That's pretty good, right?  Yeah.  I'm going to have to check that out.  When you think, you know, ballet, am I watching this shit?  When you do a movie with her or Franco, you've got to be pulling for them in the Oscars, though.  It's like you know that yours is next.  It's like you have to be pulling.  The bigger they are, the better your films are going to do.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, we're rooting for them.  Yeah.  Because we knew that they were going to be following it up with this filth, you know.  Never in the history of Oscars.  A lot of people are going to be confused.  What was up with Franco at the Oscars?  He seemed like he wasn't into it or something.  A lot of people said he might have been high or maybe he didn't get along with Ann. 
[00:59:30]  I know you're a Hollywood guy now, so maybe you don't want to say anything.  You know, every time I've talked about it, he's just said, you know, I did the best with what I was given.  And, you know, that's kind of what his take is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they were given some shit about the writer.  What's his name?  Oh, Bruce.  Yeah.  Bruce Valanche.  I think it's a tough spot because they don't want you to really do what you need to do to be funny in the end, right?  Yeah.  And it's tough that when the Oscars are over, everyone just talks about the hosts and not the people who actually won the Oscars. 
[01:00:00]  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's become the thing.  It's like, how did the hosts do?  Yeah.  It's got to be the toughest fucking thing to get up there and just ramble in front of people that are too good for the room to laugh.  Yeah, it doesn't seem like a fun job.  No sense of humor.  Steve Martin was a good Oscar host, I think.  Even though he's bugged me with certain things, but he's funny when he's being shitty.  Like, that's when he's funniest when he's being...  Yeah, man.  He can be very condescending.  You don't like him as Inspector Clouseau?  No, I mean, I just laughed through the entire thing.  I was watching some of being there the other night.  It was just fucking Peter Sellers was so great.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  We're going to stop the conversation completely.  I figured I would do it again.  Job well done.  Thank you.  Can we segue Peter Sellers back into porn again?  We're kind of mad he did the Pink Panther.  Yeah, not happy about that.  The whole room is mad at him.  Yeah, because...  Peter Sellers, I mean.  It was Steve Martin's all along, and Peter Sellers never should have ruined it.  Yes, yes.  Peter Sellers shouldn't have done that.  Peter Sellers was brilliant, and those movies were really well done.  So we don't understand why you have to remake something like that.  I'm going to segue Peter Sellers back into porn.  Oh, how?  He used to fuck Britt Eklund, and there was nude photos of her in the magazine, and she had great tits.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  Right back.  Here we are.  You're welcome.  Let's look at Britt Eklund.  I think so, yeah.  Back in the old days, right?  Britt Eklund.  Oh, we're still in the woods.  Oh, she's got a big hairy bush, too.  Maybe it's in the woods, Danny.  I love that song.  I'm going to check that out later.  Am I looking for her bush?  What am I looking for?  Britt Eklund.  I like your job that you just get to do basically what I do all the time in my house.  Yeah.  One day someone's going to figure this out, and I'm going to be on it.  Yeah.  Wow.  She's, I remember her.  She was topless in a magazine? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, she was in a lot of shit.  Might have been We or High Society or one of those.  High Society.  Remember High Society?  Swank.  Or Cherry.  Could you show one?  Those are the good ones.  Playboy and Penthouse stunk.  Penthouse was not as bad.  Playboy was hideous.  Look at that, huh?  She had nice tits on her.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  Nice, right?  She has hair like Jill Klayberg.  Yeah, Jill Klayberg had the biggest, nastiest bush.  She showed it once.  Jill Klayberg is dead now, by the way. 
[01:02:00]  Is she really?  Yeah.  What happened?  She just recently died.  I didn't know that.  Oh, she's got old.  That's good I'm saying.  That's shocked.  She hasn't done a movie since 1978.  I know.  She was in La Luna.  Can we see what Britt Eklund looks like today so we could all be depressed?  Maybe.  Or we don't have to.  That is sad.  When you think about all these women you used to jerk off about when you were a kid, and they're  all like in their 70s now.  Oh, they're all just old ladies.  That's creepy, right?  She's probably as close to 70.  It has to be, right?  Yeah.  It still works.  Hey, um.  She's a Bond girl.  What can you say about the-  Oh, jeez.  Oh, God. 
[01:02:30]  You know what?  Not as bad.  Not that bad.  For her 70s, she looks like a little like fucking, what's her name?  Eileen Brennan from Private Benjamin.  Remember that?  The fucking-  Okay.  She looks a little like her.  Would you?  Yeah.  And fuck her in the mouth.  In her penis garage.  Look up Jill Klayberg.  Oh, damn.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck is that?  That's-  Both of their 70s now.  There's a problem with that.  Yeah, it was better in the thumbnail.  Yeah.  What's her name?  I'm sorry. 
[01:03:00]  Jill-  Jill Klayberg.  Berg.  And look, yeah, look up her fucking nasty snatch.  I didn't know she died.  Snatch.  Yes.  Her?  Yeah.  That one.  She was pretty back in the day.  She was all right.  Wasn't she looking for Mr. Goodboy or was it Diane Keaton?  No, Diane Keaton.  Diane Keaton.  It's cool.  Having a fucking Yenta conversation.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, look at that.  That's a shitload of hair just-  Yeah.  It comes into the room before she does.  Yeah.  A grand entrance.  Just around the corner.  And her bush has entered the room. 
[01:03:30]  They're doing a story on the news, off topic, about contagious cavities.  What is that?  It's not off topic.  We're talking about vaginas.  It's perfect.  How can a cavity be contagious?  Super cavities.  That's the headline, too.  Oh, my God.  Contagious cavities.  My God, man.  Any idea?  No.  No.  Isn't it some kind of bacteria?  Oh, maybe that's what it is.  All right.  I don't know.  Hey, what can you tell us about the rumor about the office?  Not true. 
[01:04:00]  Just not true.  He goes with the not true.  Why don't you keep the rumor going?  I know I should.  Well, you know what?  All right.  Yeah.  I got my own TV show, and I love that show, The Office.  I think it's awesome.  And I was thrilled that my name was even thrown into the mix, but there was never anything  formal, you know.  You would be good on The Office.  The show is pretty awesome.  Those are pretty big shoes to fill.  Yeah.  They're saying he might replace Steve Carell.  That means he's probably going to do it now.  Who?  Because we never get to him.  We never get to him.  Oh, Danny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We never get the right info. 
[01:04:30]  I've heard Danny, too.  But then I heard Ricky might, and Ricky, to me, seems like a logical choice to go back  into it because he started it.  But I don't think that's his style.  He's exec producer, though.  There's a lot of money at stake for him.  And he's also going to do another episode or two, right?  He might.  Yeah, he is.  Yeah, and Will Ferrell, he's filled in for a little bit here.  Has he?  Yeah, that'd be pretty funny.  Yeah.  He's helping to make the transition, I think.  I might have to start watching again.  Yeah.  Smart the way they're doing it.  Now that they've got all these storylines happening.  Maybe Carell won't leave now. 
[01:05:00]  There's nothing worse than when you're going to leave something.  Like, you're going to leave a chick, and you see the new guy she's dating, and you're  like, fuck.  Yeah, I thought she would kill herself, but she's doing good.  I think Gaddafi might be it.  They're going to bring him in.  Yeah.  And where are you at with Eastbound and Down?  We just started writing the next season about a month ago, so we're in the mix of that  now.  We're going to shoot it this summer.  Nice.  Yeah.  So I'm looking forward to getting back into that again.  We have a good time on that show.  You guys want to incorporate a character, like a guy who's kind of fucking, he blinks 
[01:05:30]  a lot out of his left eye, and kind of a weak chin, pale, contributes very little to  a radio show.  If you need a character like that.  I like where this is going.  I'm seeing a lot of options here.  Who is there one available?  Who is there?  You'd be good on Eastbound and Down.  This show is just the best.  My manager did something so awkward like that the other day.  I shot, I did an episode of Chelsea lately, and I'm with my manager, and fucking managers  are just, you know, they're just awful.  And we're backstage with the exact producer, and we're just chatting with the topics, and 
[01:06:00]  he goes, yeah, Chelsea, after lately, he's doing very well, too, the show she does after.  And my manager goes, yeah, yeah, we should get Jim on that.  And I'm like, and the guy goes, yeah, everybody wants to get on it.  But that's what he should have said.  And I said to my manager, I'm like, maybe you don't want to ask in front of me.  It's humiliating for everybody.  That's like your mom trying to hook you up with a date with someone, right?  No, no, I don't think so.  I'm busy.  I had to scold him.  Yeah, because then he comes back to you and comes up with something that's a little  better than that to let you down easier, right? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, but I was right there when he said it.  And I told my manager, I'm like, I'm sorry, Jim, sorry, sorry, sorry.  I'm like, just please, not in front of me.  Don't put them in that position.  It's fucking horrible.  You should have led with this picture of you and Ozzy.  That would have got you on the show.  Yeah.  I have it on my Twitter thing.  There's a great photo of Ozzy and myself, as there should be.  Yeah.  I love Ozzy.  You have plenty of them.  Wait, this is the new, we got the new trailer.  I've been watching.  Boom.  Wait, this is the new trailer that has more stuff in it.  Can we watch it from the beginning?  You could if you want to watch a three and a half minute trailer. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, fuck, why not?  Are you uncomfortable watching yourself or no?  Are you used to?  This is just like at home.  I just sit here and watch this over and over and over and over again.  I like how the rated R was like on a big red screen.  There live two brothers.  One brave and bold.  Franko.  There you go.  The other, not so much.  Courtney, will you make funny faces to entertain me?  No.  Never triangle face.  I hate triangle face.  It scares me. 
[01:07:30]  Prepare to meet your doom.  I'm here to steal a beautiful virgin that looks just like her.  And just how do you plan on doing that?  Magic.  Motherfucker.  You must journey with your brother to rescue the bride.  Or you can face banishment from the kingdom.  Shit.  Let the quest begin.  Brother, I don't think you'll need that armor.  You may quest the way you like.  I will quest the way I like. 
[01:08:00]  Here I come.  I'll stop this.  That's literally my least favorite part of the whole movie.  That's kind of funny.  I will probably die on this quest.  Courtney definitely will.  If we work together, we can destroy Lazar once and for all.  Just say we are too late.  Lazar was able to get her cookies.  Would you still want her?  I don't want to think about that.  Yes, I know.  But what if he buttfucked her?  Would you still like her?  Shut up.  Oh, damn, yeah. 
[01:08:30]  There we go.  This scene.  Get the fuck out of here.  She's looking at us.  Remain perfectly still.  Goddamn.  The look of the film is real good.  It looks legit.  Oh, fuck it.  It does.  That guy looks like a young Pee-wee Herman.  Anyone else know that?  Yes.  Oh, but if your vagina is anything like my hand, there will be no problem. 
[01:09:00]  We will ensure that you run into no danger.  With our huge muscles, we shall protect you.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Catch your eyes.  That didn't really go as planned.  What the fuck?  CGI.  You've got to suck out the venom.  I don't want to suck it.  You suck it.  I can't suck my own venom.  Yes, you can.  I'll help you.  Go and suck the venom. 
[01:09:30]  I've never sucked it.  Suck it.  Holy dick.  Nice.  Whenever you maidens are ready.  Ready.  Boom.  Non-stop action.  Goddamn.  I gotta see this movie.  This is epic, motherfucker.  It really looks epic.  I'll do epic music, too.  Oh, God.  That looks great, man. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, we gave up on our radio show, so it has to be good.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  There you go.  Visually, it's like, holy shit.  Hello.  Cock-a-doodle-doodle.  Thaddeus?  Yes?  I've not been able to stop thinking of you.  What a coincidence.  I was just about to finish thinking of you.  He's going to jerk off.  Jerk off jokes.  Jerk off jokes.  Thaddeus deserves and share a vision with me.  Thaddeus, are you seeing what I'm seeing?  You making a fool of yourself.  Handle your shit, Fabius, please. 
[01:10:30]  Someone let us do that.  What a smart idea to put an uncensored trailer online like that.  That's the beauty of what you can do these days.  And it's fucking so nice to hear just brutal language from comedy.  It's like...  Yeah.  And you know a shitload of people are going to see it now, too.  Yeah.  With these alternate places where you could promote shit.  It's like...  They said buttfuck instead of what comedies normally do now, which is like, who'd you let  him put his winky in your...  It's like, get the fuck out of here with the cute stuff.  That's...  Just say it.  Just say it, right?  Well, buttfuck is a period...  That's a period from the text. 
[01:11:00]  It's part of the jargon of the era.  No, but it's nice, though, man.  You know what made me laugh hard was Observe and Report.  I talked about that movie.  It didn't do as well at the box office, but that fucking Ray Liotta, I hate your fucking  guts, screaming.  It was great.  That brutal fucking language, man.  Comedy does not have that.  I love that movie.  Jody Hill, who created Eastbound with me, he directed that film.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah, I love...  Very underrated movie.  Absolutely.  I loved it, too.  Me and Jimmy.  Anna Faris is just hilarious.  And I love slapstick violence.  Yeah.  Like that.  When he fucking wails him with the skateboard in the face. 
[01:11:30]  It's like classic shit.  I love that, man.  You, obviously, a lot of sword play and stuff.  Did you have to work with, like, a swordsman and figure out all that shit?  Because I watched all the behind-scenes things for the Lord of the Rings movies.  Total geek.  Or pederast.  Yeah, well, whatever.  You decide.  And, like, they really had to work fucking ridiculous hard for it.  Yeah, you know, I wrote this movie, and so anything that seemed like it was going to be difficult, I just made Franco do it.  I would just change it. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, okay.  You wrote this?  Yeah, I wrote this.  Oh, yeah, that's great.  Yeah, me and Ben Best, who is one of the other creators of Eastbound, he plays Clegg in Eastbound, down the bartender.  Yeah, we wrote that.  And David Green directs a bunch of episodes of Eastbound, and, yeah, we keep it all in the family.  Keep it in the family, yeah.  Yeah, fuck.  So you didn't want to wheel the hero's sword?  Well, and I'm supposed to be, like, terrible at sword fighting, so I went to, like, one or two days of training, and David, the director, was like,  Listen, I want you to be terrible.  Don't let these guys teach you anything.  Stop going to those things. 
[01:12:30]  But Franco, honestly, could do all this shit in his sleep.  Like, he did six months of training for this Tristan and Isolde, I guess, back in the day, where he did all the sword fighting and horseback riding.  And so he can literally, like, jump off of horses when they're moving and, like, fight people with swords.  The dude really, there's nothing he can't do.  That's handy to have in this day and age.  Yeah.  You can walk into a club with a sword and step up, you know, broadsword him to the face.  It's uncomfortable being around, like, a real leading man.  Like, that would just, he's just, James Franco's a handsome, talented dude. 
[01:13:00]  That would just make me really uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Well, you know, he plays my brother in this, and I always get that I look just like James Franco.  So, it only made sense to cast him.  No, you don't.  No, trust me.  Oh, literal, Jim.  Literal guy that ruined the joke.  Bullshit.  Let me say hi to Coke Logic, a regular from Chicago.  He's got a good question.  Coke Logic.  Danny McBride in studio.  Can he fucking power?  No, I won't do that to you.  You can.  It's all right. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, I love the music on East Fun and Down.  I've been a fan of Jody Hill and yours since Foot Fist Way even.  And I just want to know, like, how much of a decision do you guys have inputting for the music in the show?  Are you panicking, Coke Logic?  We are.  Hold on.  Let's enjoy the panic in his voice before you answer the question.  Jimmy's roaring over here.  This is what we do on our show.  We slow it down a little bit.  It just made me laugh.  How much did you have input in the music? 
[01:14:00]  Well, Coke Logic, you know what?  Jody and I, HBO is pretty awesome.  We control everything with that show.  So any song that goes in there usually comes from mine or Jody's iTunes library.  We control everything that goes on with the show.  How many episodes do you do a year?  We, uh, the first season was six, the last season was seven, and this season will be maybe seven or eight.  That's cool. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything else?  Nervous Nelly?  Yeah.  Oh, I just saw Due Date, and I loved your character in there where he spit on the glass.  Oh, yeah.  The vet.  Yes.  Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Big fan.  Talk to you.  Bye.  That's a great drunk, man.  This Coke Logic, he's, like, really good with design and stuff.  He's a graphic designer and type stuff, and he did my new CD.  I'm not plugging Despicable.  Yes, of course not.  Why would you?  But he did all the artwork for it.  I got a drunk message from him.  He's a fucking complete...  Wow, really? 
[01:15:00]  ...nervous alky.  You know Coke Logic?  Oh, I do.  Oh, we know.  We all know him, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, he's a very, uh, he's a lot of animation.  He's animated a lot of art.  He looks like John Papa.  Oh, okay.  He's a very good-looking dude.  Yeah.  Yes.  I call him a graphic artist.  What an asshole I am.  He's an animator.  I'm like, yeah, he designs...  Makes cartoons.  Fool him.  Sorry.  He's done some great animation for our show, though.  I wanted to know, uh, how much input...  A little John Papa-ish, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Just throw a harmonica in there.  And he's all... 
[01:15:30]  That hat.  Is he spouting down to an hour, right?  30 minutes.  Oh, it is 30 minutes.  Oh, it's quick.  We keep it tight.  Yeah, it's quick.  Are you good with collaboration?  I'm bad with writing stuff with people.  Like, I get very possessive of what I write.  Like, I'm never good with that stuff.  Oh, so you're difficult, you're saying.  No, no, but it's hard to see what you've written just bastardized by less talented people.  Ah.  You know, I collaborate with these guys I've known forever.  We never have ever gotten into any arguments about creative shit.  I mean, we'll write stuff, but we always improv and everything, so it's kind of, if you 
[01:16:00]  want to get into the deal, you just got to know that shit's going to be thrown out,  and the best joke's going to win, and, you know.  We just try to fill enough jokes in there that you don't have to hold on to one too dearly.  Oh, yeah, that's a good way to look at it, Jimmy.  More jokes.  Yeah.  More jokes.  More jokes.  No, no, I'm not nothing now.  I've just, I've always been bad at that.  I'm always amazed by guys who can collaborate with other people and do a good job.  Do you have a, yeah.  Oh, go ahead, Dan.  I'd always be mad at the editor.  I'd always be like, no!  Why are you taking that out?  We filmed it. 
[01:16:30]  What are you doing?  Oh, the safety?  You always seem to, hmm?  You're talking about the safety?  No, it's like everything.  Just like the editor.  Whenever you film something, and you know you did something that's a little edgy, and they go,  that was really good, but let's do one for a safety.  One more for safety.  And they always use the safety, which is...  You don't do it.  That's why.  You say no.  I know.  Well, now we've learned over the years.  I'm not doing that for safety.  Could you just say poo-poo instead of shit?  Just for safety.  Yeah, whatever it was.  Just in case we need it.  And you know they're going with poo-poo.  Did you have any stuff you wanted to write that you wrote that you didn't do in this? 
[01:17:00]  Because it seems like you got away with a lot, but was there anything you wanted  to do that couldn't?  No.  Everything, we pushed it as far as we could, and weirdly enough, we've been able to keep pushing  things.  On Eastbound, for instance, HBO never gives us notes on content that shit's too far.  That's great.  Yeah, they always encourage us to go further.  They pulled back on one joke.  There was one joke that they nixed this season.  I think last season when Kenny was in Mexico, he tells the Mexican baseball team that Mexico  makes the Holocaust look like Club fucking Med.  Oh, shit.  They didn't like that. 
[01:17:30]  That was the only joke that they gave a note on.  They just said, no way.  No Holocaust jokes.  Hit a sore spot.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  So they'll pick one to kind of gang up on, and then we'll let them have that, and then  put the rest.  You ever float one out there knowing, I don't even give a fuck about that joke, let them  focus on this?  Yes, yes.  We do that kind of stuff all the time.  Yeah, and then you get away with the other things, because that one looked really bad.  You throw a Holocaust joke in just to make the fucking, the ass fuck joke.  Yes.  We'll take out the Holocaust one.  You're right.  The ass fuck.  Because you wanted the ass fuck the whole time.  Yeah, that's actually smart. 
[01:18:00]  You've got to pick your battles.  It's kind of hard to argue for the Holocaust.  Yeah, there is no winning argument for that.  You can't say that it's funny.  You're like, yeah, well, you're right.  That is a big case.  And then you just blame it on your collaborator.  It wasn't even my joke.  It was jokes.  Yeah, I told him, but he said, look, let's just try it.  I'm like, all right, whatever.  So I'm fine with it.  Yeah, I'm totally fine.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Andy on Long Island.  We've got Danny McBride in the studio.  Andy, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Morning.  You know what?  I'll bring it back a little bit.  You just were talking about before in Black Swan. 
[01:18:30]  They said, like, Natalie Portman didn't do all the dancing.  I just read online that in that trailer you guys just watched, I already watched it too,  but they show Natalie Portman's ass in that.  I read online that she actually used a body double.  No.  Really?  That looked like her ass.  Yeah, you can see in the shot that it's her taking her clothes off, she looks over her shoulders.  The only thing they use the body double for is there's a shot where she dives into the water.  So the person who enters the water is a body double.  But her standing there, it's her.  But her standing there.  Why?  She didn't want to get wet that day?  Oh, she's diving into a shallow pond. 
[01:19:00]  You know, things can happen.  Insurance.  Have her in a wheelchair.  So she had a stunt double for the dive, but the ass, that's her.  That's her.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I wonder with insurance, too.  You know about, like, I was watching the trailer for Mission Impossible 4, or not the  trailer, but Tom Cruise was on top of the Burge Tower.  He's like 17 or 1500 feet in the air.  I'm like, what was the fucking insurance to hang Tom Cruise?  Ten bucks.  That's all it is.  See, I would have thought it was more.  We're talking about Your Highness, because a lot of people say, what fucking movie is he  promoting?  Oh, yeah.  David Frank's new movie. 
[01:19:30]  It's a week from Friday, right?  Yes.  April 8th.  Your Highness.  Yes.  Where's the premiere?  You know, we did this thing where they, like, there was a contest.  I found like Coke logic.  Yeah.  There was a contest to host the premiere at a college, so all the universities had a vote  on where the premiere was going to be.  That's pretty cool.  Take that shit to the streets, you know?  Yeah.  And University of Santa Barbara.  They won, which is nice, because I can drive there.  That's a very good idea, actually. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  That's why they won, so you could drive there.  Yeah, what a coincidence.  So many people want to talk to you.  Rob in Garden City, what's up?  Hey there, Rob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Danny, big fan.  But the guy that plays Stevie on East Down and Down, how did you find this guy, man?  He's like the perfect douchebag personified, you know, the types of things that he does.  And, like, how is he offset?  You know, that character that he plays.  Steve Little is the actor that plays him.  He's one of the funniest guys I've ever met before. 
[01:20:30]  I mean, yeah, he just has this crazy vibe to him that is kind of hard to emulate.  I'm going to sell him out here for a second.  When we were down in Puerto Rico shooting this, like, he really appreciates his newfound fame,  and he's constantly trying to use it to hook up with ladies.  And he was having a little trouble with that.  And McConaughey is in a scene of last season, and so he came down to Puerto Rico to party with us.  And Steve Little had a little bit of time alone with McConaughey and was asking him, like, picking his brain, like, how do you do it? 
[01:21:00]  How can you seal the deal?  How can you use this fame to get women?  And McConaughey told him that an old trick that could work is if you manage to get him back to the hotel room,  in the middle of talking, just say that you're going to go take a shower.  And don't invite them.  Just say you're going to take a shower.  Go commit to the shower.  And, you know, usually they'll just follow.  So Steve Little came down to Wilmington, North Carolina when we were filming.  He managed to get two girls back to his hotel room.  And they were talking for about an hour, hour and a half, and finally he decided he was going to use the McConaughey line. 
[01:21:30]  He said, ladies, I'm going to go get a shower.  Went into the shower, turned it on, was in there for five minutes, then just heard the door to his hotel close.  I'm beginning to think that maybe it was, you know, you've got to probably be Matthew McConaughey for that.  Yeah, he could probably pull that one off.  Please tell me they robbed him, too.  They robbed him.  They stole his kidneys.  We were all hoping they threw a toaster and plugged in.  Right.  Let's go to Matt in Ohio.  If you want to talk to Danny McBride, go for it. 
[01:22:00]  Matt, what do you got?  Danny, hey, my favorite line in Eastbound and Down was when you were talking to that blonde slut, and you were giving all kinds of compliments.  And you were like, but your wardrobe is a dickhead.  Oh, she wears clothes like a fucking dickhead.  Yes, yes.  That's awesome.  A dickhead.  You don't really see too many guys calling girls dickheads.  No, it's a great word.  Yeah.  Dickhead's a fucking great word, man.  It is.  You don't say it enough.  No.  I'll start using it every day. 
[01:22:30]  Find a reason.  No room for interpretation with that.  The boss is a dickhead.  Yeah.  Case closed.  No way around that.  Nah, there's no way to say you didn't let me finish.  Right, right, right.  We all got it.  Ah, shit.  Well, this movie looks like it's going to be great.  Your highness.  You, um...  Absolutely.  What's the, uh...  How much acting training did you take before?  Because you're very successful.  Comic acting is fucking hard, man.  It's not easy to do. 
[01:23:00]  Uh, I did none.  Oh, really?  I went on.  I love hearing that.  I really do.  I went to film school to go be a writer and director, and that's where I met guys like  Jody Hill, who directed Observe, and David Green, who directed this.  We all lived in the same dorm my freshman year of college, and so we would just put each  other in our films because we didn't know any actors, and then that was really kind of  what happened.  Did film school help you, you think?  Like, as far as...  What did it teach you that was really valuable, or was it a lot of shit, too?  No, honestly, it definitely helped.  I mean, I went to an art school, so I didn't have to take a bunch of, like, astrology and that 
[01:23:30]  kind of shit.  Right.  I just took only film classes for four years, but, no, it definitely helps.  I mean, you get to just make movies for four years and figure it out, and all the people  I work with are guys that I went to film school with, so it was a lot about the people  I met there.  Why would I go to a regular college?  I learned nothing from my doormates.  Yeah, right?  They're all a bunch of bums.  Did you hear who he was hanging out with in college?  Kevin Spitz is the same thing, though.  It's the people you meet.  Like, that was what his most valuable thing was.  Well, he went to college for, like, two weeks.  Yeah, yeah, he dropped out.  And then he said, fuck it.  Jersey fucking bum.  I learned how to smoke a hash under a glass. 
[01:24:00]  What else?  Those are valuable lessons.  Sure.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Why not?  Mr. Successful Hollywood Guy, really?  There's a lot of people that go to film school that don't do much, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  I know.  That's the hard part.  It's an easy look at the success story.  Let's go to Brendan in Ohio.  Brendan.  Brendan.  Hey, Gordon.  Hi, Brendan.  Hey, Danny.  I love everything you do, man.  You're great.  I was just wondering if working with George Clooney is as good as everybody says it is, or if  he's kind of a douchebag. 
[01:24:30]  No, he was totally cool.  You know, that movie up in the air that I did with him, I never had met him before.  I literally walked onto the set.  I forgot you were in that.  I love that fucking movie.  Fucking Oscar-nominated movie.  I forgot all about that.  We haven't talked to you since then.  No, that was a great...  How was that experience?  It was nuts.  I mean, like, with guys like Clooney, like, I'd never met him before.  I'd just see him on TV, and you walk onto the set, and they're like, all right, we're  ready for your scene with Mr. Clooney, and you just have to sit down, and, you know,  it's kind of hard to get into the deal, but you have to act confident. 
[01:25:00]  Like, yeah, I'm used to doing scenes with Clooney.  This isn't a big deal.  Just kind of roll with it.  Are you almost like...  I've been in situations where I'm almost so nervous, and, like, the consequences are...  I'm so overwhelmed that you click in and do okay.  It's almost like it's so big that you're fine with it.  Yeah, like, that scene is where...  The first scene I did with him was where he's, like, talking me into getting married, like,  I've walked out of my marriage, and so there's a lot of nervous, you know, nervous tics in  that scene, and that was just real.  That was just me really being nervous.  Just being nervous, acting in front of Clooney? 
[01:25:30]  Did you blow any takes?  I didn't.  I hope I didn't.  I don't think I did.  Yeah.  I'm hard to crack in scenes.  I don't laugh.  I don't fuck around.  Oh, really?  I'm a machine.  Really?  I mean, like, miss a line, you never forget a line?  No.  That's amateur shit.  Yeah.  Yep.  I forgot about Up in the Air.  Jeez.  It's a great movie.  I've forgotten lines.  Huh?  You've forgotten lines, Jimmy?  In front of who, though?  Whoever's looking.  I mean, I've not done very big projects.  If it's in front of us, who cares?  The rest of the people in community theater? 
[01:26:00]  No, I just...  In front of who, though?  Anyone big that we know?  No.  Louis C.K.  Oh, okay.  Jimmy's downplaying it.  Well, that's the beauty of improv, too, is, like, if you forget a line, just throw in  something else, and then it just looks like you just made a choice, as opposed to that  you fucked up.  Ah.  Yeah.  And what do you do with your hands?  Just kind of...  Just do this.  You do, like, robot hands.  You do the robot hands?  Yeah.  Just do this over and over.  Hey.  I never know what to do.  That's the big thing with me and every actor I talk to, is when I act, I never have to do  my hands.  So I found pop locking helps.  Yeah.  That's right.  Pop locking.  It looks real natural. 
[01:26:30]  It's good.  Yeah.  That's a good question.  Any chance of a second Pineapple Express?  You know, everybody involved with that movie has talked about it.  We had an awesome time working on that movie, and so I think it's a matter of just kind  of figuring out what to write in for it.  But I know that everyone involved would be down for getting on board again.  Just think Caddy Shack, too, though.  Yeah.  That's what you got to look out for.  Oh.  Oh.  That's bad.  Comedies are scary to do a second one, right?  There's been a few.  What have been good comedy sequels, though?  There's been a few that have done all right, I guess.  The Vacations did okay, more than one of them. 
[01:27:00]  I mean, uh...  And then there was the...  Fridays?  Empire Strikes Back was pretty hilarious.  Yeah.  That was good.  It was really funny.  Yeah, Austin Powers, uh, Yurok mentioned, I guess.  Yeah, that worked.  It's tough, though, because, you know, you see what the jokes that people laugh at in  the first one, you just try to do the same thing again, and it doesn't work, and it's  just like reloading, you know, a joke.  How do people think that works?  Because it works in drama.  Like, a lot of times, the same dramatic moments, it's like the same dramatic point can be made  twice in a moment, but you can't make the same joke twice. 
[01:27:30]  It sounds ridiculous.  You can't capture that funny moment like that again.  Yeah.  You can see what's coming.  Remember when we were talking about porn in the woods?  Yes!  Where did we go?  You try to relay the story to somebody, and they're like, oh, you're a dick, and so are  they.  Oh, Blues Brothers 2000.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  That was good.  Sure, yeah.  Oh, boy.  No way.  What's your favorite comedy on TV, besides your own show?  What's your favorite? 
[01:28:00]  God, that's a tough one.  Of all time, let's say.  Of all time, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  I mean, when I was a kid, I grew up on stuff like Cheers.  I thought that was hilarious, and I don't know.  I guess recently, I just started watching the show Portlandia.  Have you ever seen that on IFC?  Oh, it's about Portland.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I did five shows there for a total of 11 people, so I have no love for Portland.  It kind of puts fun in Portland.  It's a really funny show, and Louie is hilarious.  I love that Louie C.K. show.  I think it's awesome.  Yeah, it's great.  It's well done.  What about your favorite comedy movie of all time, or like a short list? 
[01:28:30]  My short list, I mean, a lot of them, it's everything from like Pootie Tang to the original  Bad News Bears.  I like the fact there was drinking in that, though, the first one, the math I was drinking.  Oh, with the children.  I like the new one.  They took that out.  It was a bad message.  It really was.  That first one is such a fucking amazing movie.  At the end of the movie, it just ends with the kids telling their team to shove the trophy  up their ass and drinking beer.  It's literally the best thing that's ever been called on film.  You can't do that anymore. 
[01:29:00]  And that was like a movie you'd take the kids to.  Oh, yeah.  It was incredible.  And they're cursing and fucking shit.  Just popping beers.  And that was like a, you know, G, PG.  All right.  Vic Morrow was great before he decided to fucking play fucking hopscotch under the ceiling fan  a couple years later.  I don't know if he decided that, Jimmy.  Ow.  All right.  We should get Danny out of here.  He's got a lot of press today, sir.  I got a good.  I got a fair bit.  I'm doing a little tour around Sirius XM station today.  Ah.  So now we get to awkwardly see you in the halls after we say goodbye to you. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  So we'll say goodbye here.  Then we'll keep running into each other.  We'll do that.  Clench your mouth up and nod.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Good time on the show, guys.  How you doing?  Yeah.  Well, this movie.  I don't.  I stop and shake hands every time.  That's awkward.  I'm completely uncomfortable.  That's awkward.  This movie's going to do great.  It really is.  It looks really funny, man.  It's called Your Highness in theaters next Friday.  Go see it.  Yes.  And then you come back to promote something else, I'm sure.  Yes, I would love to.  But let's focus on this.  Your Highness with Danny McBride.  Always a pleasure, sir.  Thank you guys for having me on.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:30:00]  We'll continue to do it.  Get after it.  Yes.  Yes.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show is online.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Opie Radio.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cruz.  Boomy and Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  Yeah, whatever.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You know what?  Yeah, I should be in movies.  Silly Goose writes, you deserve an Oscar.  What are you going to do?  You're going to ruin it.  Liar, liar, pants on fire. 
[01:30:30]  I got to acknowledge it.  So many people are calling me out right now, saying that I loved Up in the Air.  I guess we might have trashed that movie when it came out.  You had me doubting for a second, because when you said it, I was like, oh yeah, you were  in that.  We love that movie.  And I went, wait, wait, wait.  I was thinking to myself, wait, wait, hold on.  Well, I definitely liked Danny McBride in that movie.  Well, who wouldn't?  No, I really did.  Yeah.  I forgot that I didn't like the movie. 
[01:31:00]  I actually forgot.  I would love if we could find that.  I actually forgot that I didn't like that movie.  You should find.  I wasn't even trying to play the role of he's in, so don't do that to yourself.  Right.  I'm telling you, I forgot that I didn't like that movie.  Is there a...  I'm telling you the truth now, because everyone thought you hated it.  You guys are pussies.  Oh, real brave guys.  You guys said Up in the Air sucked.  Is there a way to find that?  Yeah, I'm going through. 
[01:31:30]  I'm looking forward to it.  I would love to hear Ovi's take on it just moments after saying, and I quote, I loved  that movie.  But I wasn't trying to do a thing.  Oh, I know.  I swear to you.  I forgot that I didn't like that movie.  I thought it was a different movie when you were just saying how you loved it.  I was like, is that a different movie with Clooney?  Or is it the one where he's on the plane with the girl and the...  I really forgot.  And what I was going to tell Danny McBride, his role in that movie, it almost made it  seem like he was part of another movie. 
[01:32:00]  You know what I mean?  Because all of a sudden...  So you're saying it was almost as if he was in a whole different movie than that one.  Meaning his movie was good.  His movie was good.  And the other movie was not so good.  Right.  As a matter of fact, let me put it to you this way.  Because most of the movie was in an airplane, an airport, or a hotel room.  Next thing you know, Danny McBride's getting married in a small town.  So it was disconnected from the rest of the movie.  Let me explain to you something.  Your rant originally, and I don't remember it by details, on that movie, Up in the Air, 
[01:32:30]  was so effective that I have not seen the movie ever just based on your trashing it.  I think it was more Jimmy that was trashing it.  Jimmy gave it a bit of a trashing, too.  I gave it a beating.  I think Jimmy...  I think I wrote Jimmy's back on that one.  Because I really don't remember.  I think Jimmy might have sucked me into this one.  I did forget that Danny was in it. 
[01:33:00]  But I do like Danny a lot.  But I wouldn't say I loved the movie.  I wouldn't trash it with him right here.  Well, we did very well, right?  Some Oscar nominations and all that shit.  So what do we know?  But I really forgot that I...  I almost ended my friendship with Lenny Marcus over recommending it.  Are you kidding?  No.  It was terrible.  It was awful.  He's right there.  I'm sorry, Danny.  He's looking right at us.  What can I do?  Danny's a tremendous success.  Yeah, we support him.  By the way, I got a very funny tweet from somebody.  He said he spent the night playing turkey foot with his niece. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  I forgot about turkey foot.  Hot.  Hey, we're going to have Brock Lesnar in tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Yes.  So that's happening.  It is happening.  Wow.  Are you...  I have to...  Ariel Hawane helped a lot to the MMA show he has on MMAfighting.com.  And who's Paul Haney's name is, I think?  He's a wrestler from WWE.  Paul Heyman.  Heyman, I'm sorry.  Yes.  He's Brock's best friend.  He helped us on that, too. 
[01:34:00]  It was a clusterfuck with the scheduling.  Right.  Will you let Brock put you in a hold?  Yeah, but someone said that...  Oh, shit.  I want him to, if he will.  If someone said on Fallon that Fallon's doing my bit, which I'm sure he's just not doing  my bit.  He just did it.  But did he let him put him in a hold on Fallon?  That I don't know.  I mean, it sounds like something Fallon would do.  I'm sure.  I need one more hold for my best of...  Best of Jimmy.  I would love to get Brock to do that.  I would love to.  I'm sure he would.  My best of Jimmy getting the shit beat out of him by MMA guys video.  Yeah, he's coming to a theater near you. 
[01:34:30]  He's a big fucking strong one, too.  He would actually make me nervous.  He's intimidating.  We met him at...  Which show was that?  Philly or...  That was in...  I think it was the Philly show.  New York.  It was New York.  Last year.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I was just seeing that picture of Brock Lesnar with the...  If you want to have some fun at home, folks, go to...  Just Google...  Just Brock Lesnar and just hit enter.  And just the first thing that comes up, it'll probably make you laugh.  Yeah, it's very funny.  That's funny.  He's going to be one of those intimidating guys tomorrow.  Yeah, they're really fine.  They're usually pretty cool guys. 
[01:35:00]  You think?  Yeah, he's great.  He'll be a fine interview.  Well, unfortunately, he couldn't wait a day because we could have got this out of him tomorrow.  But remember that Undertaker thing?  Yeah, he gave it to Ariel.  But again, that's the guy who does all the MMA stuff.  But he finally is talking about the Undertaker confrontation that everyone thought was a setup for WrestleMania and all that crap.  Remember?  Everyone remembers the incident, right?  Yeah, the Undertaker walked up to him.  While Brock Lesnar lost, his title walked past the Undertaker.  As he's walking out of the ring, like right afterwards, he walked past the Undertaker. 
[01:35:30]  And the Undertaker had some words for him that no one understood.  He's a typical asshole wrestler.  It just makes me dislike wrestlers even more.  Are we going to do this?  Are we going to do this?  Do this now.  And it was so weird.  People were thinking it was a setup.  But Brock Lesnar explains here.  You know, I was interviewing him.  I don't even know if you saw the clip.  But we were asking about his thoughts on the fight.  And then you walked past him.  Yeah, you know, I was a bit delirious.  I went out.  Obviously, you know, Kane put me on a street that I didn't know the name of. 
[01:36:00]  And so I was looking for my way home.  So I went out the Octagon and I was, you know, I had heard that Mark was, the Undertaker was going to be there.  Mark.  You know, once again, I enjoyed working with Mark in the ring.  Still not on purpose.  Me and him, there were some things said that we had a mutual friend.  And that kind of really pissed me off. 
[01:36:30]  He asked you, do you want to do it?  And we still don't even know what that means.  What did that mean to you?  It's one of those things where we've got a mutual friend.  And I overheard some things that he said about me.  And then I had a rebuttal to it.  And he must have, our friend must have relayed the message to him.  And he wasn't too happy.  I don't know what he wants to do.  Maybe he wanted to try to fight.  I don't know if he was there to fight or what. 
[01:37:00]  You know, he wasn't, or if he was there to get some attention or what.  I don't know.  Wow.  But he won't say what was said.  No.  I like, I love the Mark thing.  Yeah.  He's doing that on purpose.  That's funny.  Oh, he's, I'm looking at Fallon.  Brock's putting him in a move of some sort.  Oh, he is.  Yeah.  But again, that's.  Yeah.  What else are you going to do?  Yeah.  Big bruisers.  Brock continues, thinks some of the wrestlers are jealous that he can't make the change. 
[01:37:30]  Could be.  Or they can't make the change, I guess.  Could be.  MMA.  I guess if you guys want to do that, right?  Yeah.  I would say.  Do you feel it's a little disrespectful?  I mean, you just fought in a title fight.  You know, you're obviously, like you said, you were trying to gather yourself.  And then a guy who you have history with is essentially calling you out face to face.  Not exactly the right time and place, wouldn't you say?  You know, these, the professional wrestling isn't, you know, these, these guys are, were 
[01:38:00]  a part of my life years ago.  And I think they see me having success outside of the, of, of their universe that they can't  do.  You know, those, those, those, there isn't one other pro wrestler that can do and make  the, the, the, the change like I did.  So I think there's some animosity there from the professional wrestling aspect of things.  Because I can always go back and be a pro wrestler.  They can't come and be an ultimate fighter.  Wow.  He's, he's well-spoken. 
[01:38:30]  He's great.  I mean, he's a good interviewer, I think.  Yeah, I think so.  We're going to have a good time with him tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah.  He's, I think he's just.  Would you expect?  I don't know.  I know.  That's true.  I haven't really heard him talk before.  I mean, in the wrestling ring, which is different.  Cause you're, you're, you're hyping shit up, but not just a normal, just normal.  He just doesn't talk as much.  He's a reserved guy.  And I think he'll be a lot of fun.  I'm actually looking forward to him a lot.  Um, he's not an easy guy to get in studio.  He doesn't do a lot of radio.  No, we, Jimmy did a lot to get this done for tomorrow. 
[01:39:00]  We had it booked, but then scheduling it all mixed up.  It was just one of those things.  It's just the way it is with a bunch of, they're trying to get 50 things done in three.  You're right.  You know what?  No, no.  He's a hundred percent.  I'm so kidding.  I would never do that if I really meant it.  No, no.  But you should have done it because you were the voice of the audience.  Uh, you meant, you meant it, but you spun in such a way where you saved face.  I saw what you did.  But I'll just, I'll wrap it up quickly. 
[01:39:30]  I, um.  I missed the and.  I had sent texts to Roland.  Roland wasn't getting back to me yesterday at all.  Roland was just panicking.  Oh, man.  I sent him fucking eight messages and he was not getting back to me.  Hey, what about, uh, yeah, Norm?  Norm's coming in tomorrow too.  From 9 to 9.30, yeah.  Is he going to be in when Brock's in?  No.  Well, that's what Jimmy was worried about.  No, because I don't want anybody when Brock's in because Brock is fucking, is a massive guest.  Yeah.  And I love, Norm isn't a massive guest. 
[01:40:00]  Norm's a massive guest too.  He is, but Brock is.  Just in a different world.  Brock is.  I wonder who would be a bigger guest.  Brock Lesnar.  Overall.  Brock.  He's got, just one video of him in the big show.  His fucking two million YouTube views.  Yeah.  Norm's pretty big.  Huge.  He's huge.  Brock bigger than Norm?  Who do you think walking the streets?  Recognition.  Brock Lesnar?  Yeah.  Of course.  I think.  You sure?  Without a doubt.  Wanna bet?  Dude, he's only had like seven MMA fights and he's the fucking biggest name in mixed martial arts.  Because he was a big wrestler.  But we all love Norm. 
[01:40:30]  And he played fucking football.  I like Norm a lot.  I did the.  Norm is on SNL.  Why are they doing a story on the Bronx Zoo Cobra Twitter thing?  It's cute.  You got real fucking news assholes.  But it's a cute story.  Going in and out on the web.  What are you talking about?  Sometimes it's up.  Sometimes it's down.  The Twitter account.  It is amusing regardless.  Amusing and potentially lethal.  Yeah.  So watch out for this snake.  I like that guy though.  I like him because he's kind of tired of the whole thing.  Yeah.  We got a snake loose from the Bronx Zoo. 
[01:41:00]  And I guess it's a big deal for somebody out there.  I don't know.  Is it a big deal that there's a snake loose?  Who cares?  I think the people that live in the Bronx could handle a Cobra.  And it's been spotted.  I'm not worried at all.  It's been spotted that you can't catch it.  They said it was in fucking Irvine.  Which is such a weird place for a Bronx Zoo snake to be.  Irvine is in California.  What else is going on there?  I'm doing the improv this Thursday through Saturday.  What?  But it's not.  That's not how I said it.  That's not why I said it.  Oh, you snake.  What?  It's a coincidence. 
[01:41:30]  Can we see the Cobra's fucking Twitter?  Because they said it's amusing.  So we got to see.  That was the gang we had strife with when I was in the Lords.  The Cobras.  I forgot you were in the Lords.  I was in the Lords.  Look at this.  And you didn't have jackets?  Because you couldn't afford them, right?  No.  Look at this.  News stories about the fact that the Cobra has his own Twitter account.  But it's amusing.  So, Danny, why don't we read one that's amusing, please?  Almost 25,000.  25,000 followers for the Bronx Zoo Cobra. 
[01:42:00]  What do I got to do?  You want me to just read it or read one that I find amusing?  Oh, yeah.  Just read the latest one.  It's always good.  Well, it's getting pretty cold out.  I think it's probably time to crash.  Oh, look.  An open apartment window someone left open just to crack.  Perfect.  All right.  You know what?  Nah, we're all not perfect Twitterers.  Uh-oh.  So, we'll give them one.  Let's read another one there, Danny.  I agree with Brett Favre.  Snakes should be set free. 
[01:42:30]  I guess because he pulled his cock out and took pictures of it.  Was it a dick joke?  Well, they said it was amusing, Danny.  Give me one more.  The news said this is amusing.  Where's the amusement?  Don't just read a bad one.  Just read the next one.  Anyone know of a good vegan restaurant near Union Square?  No, I'm asking.  I've got to go out for lunch.  Oh, oh.  I thought you were eating something.  Could you do me a favor?  I told that before the show and I can't help myself.  Steve Morton had the worst tweet about the Cobra. 
[01:43:00]  Please go to Steve Morton's.  Steve Morton to go.  What is it?  Steve Morton to go.  And Jimmy, you know comedy, right?  I do.  Okay, good.  So, I might just be out of the loop here.  So, I want you to have an open mind about this tweet that he did about the Cobra.  Might have to go down and find it.  There it is.  You see an Egyptian.  Oh, you want me to read?  Yeah, read it for Jimmy.  And focus, Jimmy.  Is this funny?  An Egyptian Cobra has escaped and is hiding in the Bronx Zoo.  I'm sitting in my King Tut hat by the phone, awaiting their call for help. 
[01:43:30]  I wouldn't really enjoy that one.  I've checked out his Twitter.  He has some funny ones.  He's doing a callback of his King Tut hat.  Are you sitting there with an arrow through your head?  Yeah, I don't know if I would.  I have the urge to itch my earlobes right now.  That wouldn't be his best.  Are you turning the corner on Steve Martin on us?  Steve Martin, I think he's very funny. 
[01:44:00]  I just hate the fact that he did those.  That bothers me so much that he did those Pink Panther movies.  Was his stand-up good?  Yeah, he was funny.  We're too busy with the King Tut and all that shit.  I forget what his other shit was.  And he did some great movies.  Steve Martin was great because he was doing weird shit that nobody was doing.  Was he an alternative comic?  Kind of, yeah.  But before that, I mean, in front of 12,000 people.  He said, excuse me.  Remember? 
[01:44:30]  He had a funny line, I remember.  And I'm paraphrasing.  He said something about my mother called me today.  She wanted to borrow $10 for food.  And then he did a thing about how he made her bring his dumbbells up to the attic,  which I thought was really funny.  And he had a funny bit on the Tonight Show with answering machines  where you would call and check your answering machine.  Oh, right, right.  And it was all about his erection difficulties.  Yeah, I remember that one.  I think we weren't supposed to turn on Steve Martin,  but that Pink Panther thing really just fucking hurt.  Yeah, it really fucked everything up.  Yeah, that's all that probably hurt, right? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  All right, so we got the snake loose in the Bronx.  Yeah.  But they've seen the snake, and it's tweeting.  And it's tweeting.  What's the address there, Dan,  so I can go have a few laughs with the rest of the gang?  It's Bronx Zoo's Cobra.  Oh, is there a Bronx Zoo Cobra?  Oh, maybe you're just on the wrong Twitter account, Dan.  Maybe that's why we haven't read the funny yet.  No, that account has been suspended.  Oh, somebody was being a naughty boy. 
[01:45:30]  Someone was probably being funny.  All right.  Yeah, I bet you were saying stuff like,  I'm going to get out of here and start spitting on everybody or something.  Ah, that would be funny, Chip.  I know.  Oh, one more clip from Brock Lesnar about The Undertaker.  I don't even know where it came from.  You know, I was walking out.  We should have just asked him this tomorrow.  I was on a street that I didn't know the name of,  and so that's what happened.  It turned into a...  It turned into a...  It was talked about more than the actual loss.  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  ESPN was what everyone was talking about.  Four million views on YouTube.  Jesus.  Personally, I couldn't believe it.  And everyone wanted to know if this was...  You know, because wrestling, MMA,  they wanted to know were the lines being blurred here,  or was it, in fact, a legit beef?  You are saying it is a legit beef, right?  It is.  I'm not...  I don't...  It is a legit...  I got a problem with him.  You know?  Have you talked to him since?  I have not.  No.  Any interest?  I don't need to.  Mark.  Sort of takes away from the mystique of The Undertaker.  When he calls him Mark.  So, yeah, Mark was there. 
[01:46:30]  Oh.  You mean the undead guy?  Yeah.  His name is Mark.  Mark, don't make me beg you, Mark.  Oh.  Movie.  I don't know.  Don't know.  Please, Mark, come with me.  The Adventures of Mark and His Friend.  Well, it's actually Mark and His Friend have an adventure.  Oh, fuck.  Don't make me beg you, Mark.  I'll ask you once more. 
[01:47:00]  Clockwork Orange.  Just because he was doing the accent.  I was going to go there, too.  Why not?  I was going to go there.  Hit every English movie.  It was great.  I'll ask you once more.  Ask?  I'll ask you once more.  Boats Down There, the TV miniseries.  No, that was canceled.  Schindler's List.  No.  Boats Down There, the TV miniseries.  Don't glaze over that because it was political as to why it was canceled. 
[01:47:30]  What happened?  I'll ask.  The Graduate.  Because I was having all of the black boats bump in and take masts from the white boats.  And they felt that it was giving the wrong message.  Not bad off the cuff.  Not bad off the cuff.  I didn't know what to do with boats.  I saw you panic a little bit, but you saved yourself.  What movie?  Arthur. 
[01:48:00]  No.  Chariots of Fire.  No.  The Omen.  Come with me, Mark.  Roots.  You came close on one.  Arthur.  I won't tell you what one.  Arthur 2.  It was the Omen one.  The Omen.  Yeah.  The Omen one.  The Omen two.  Yeah.  Omen two.  The Omen two.  In the woods.  They say you're the beast.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Did you run up the stairs?  I forgot.  In Washington.  Was that the Omen house?  That was Exorcist. 
[01:48:30]  Exorcist house.  That's a great scene in the woods, though.  Did you run up those stairs?  I did.  I walked up them.  We ran up the stairs.  Yeah.  And you see, like, the little ways they cheated.  Like, the house isn't exactly at the steps like it was in the film.  Yeah.  When, uh...  That's a cool thing to check out in Washington.  Where is that?  Georgetown?  Yes.  Yeah.  And Burke Dennings got fucking shoved out of the way.  Do you know what she did, your cunting daughter?  That's what the show is now going to be.  Any movie before 1979 that was scary to me as a boy.  You're just going to blurt out lines. 
[01:49:00]  I'm sorry I did that Mark thing.  I just love that scene.  That's good.  That movie, uh, that movie, that house is fucking creepy.  It's creepy.  Creepy.  It's a creepy fucking house.  Call me whatever, man.  But that, when you see it from across the street, you're like, fuck, who the fuck would  live there?  Yeah, right?  Why?  It just looked creepy.  All right.  Uh, Undertaker used to be called Mean Mark, uh, what was the, uh, Edgar, go ahead.  I was sort of reading your head.  Oh, my teeth are dry. 
[01:49:30]  I don't understand.  Oh, Edgar's tried to.  We were going Joan Rivers, Edgar.  I don't know who she is.  Yeah, I don't know.  It was, uh, it was just way back in the day.  The day.  The WCW.  He used to be, because his ring name used to be Mean Mark Callas.  I think he was, he wasn't with, uh, with a tag team or anything, but yeah, by himself.  That was Mean Mark.  Callas.  I think that was the last name, but definitely.  What was his name?  Mean Mark something.  Mean Mark something.  Maybe Callas.  Callas.  Callas.  Like, yeah, Callas.  He's right.  Blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:50:00]  Brought it right back around.  Don't make me make funny sounds, Mark.  Find the devil.  I'm going to put you in a hop.  I'm going to put you in a hop.  I'm going to put you in a hop.  Hold hop.  They say you're the bear.  They say you're the bear.  They say you're the beast.  I'm the furt.  I'm the furt.  I'm the furt, devil.  Stupid family didn't even realize he was having a stroke. 
[01:50:30]  That was my biggest laugh last week.  Oh, God.  That fucking crap we did.  Who, Charlie Callas?  Oh, yeah.  Were you here for that?  Of course.  Yeah, you were.  Yeah, furt.  I did that movie with him.  It's terrible.  I have my picture with Charlie Callas.  I'll show you.  He looks like a cadaver.  Oh, yeah.  Well, sure does now.  No, no.  I mean before.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, for the love of Eve.  Sorry.  Why are you yelling, man?  That just makes me sound tougher.  We don't yell anymore on this show.  Remember?  I do. 
[01:51:00]  We talked about that earlier.  Yeah.  We don't yell anymore.  Hey, that last caller was an asshole.  Here's me and Charlie on the set.  He was with the tag team.  All right.  It's really him.  No way.  Yes, it's really him.  Let me see.  That looks like a wax figure.  I know.  It's really Charlie Callas.  It's like you're at Madame Tussauds.  Wasn't he 80-something?  That's not him.  I swear to God, it's him.  I have a picture from the wrap party.  That does look creepy.  That's frightening.  Yeah.  It doesn't look like it's a real human being. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Not a great film.  No.  He was a very nice guy, though.  I wish I had talked to him a little more.  I didn't realize how.  It must have been annoying, though.  No.  I don't know if he did any of that.  I haven't seen the movie.  Oh, he did it.  I'm sure he did it.  Why else would you hire him for a movie?  I don't know.  You want some zzzz and some fritta and a fritta.  All right.  What do you want to do?  I'm going to hang myself after talking about Charlie.  Charlie Callas.  Charlie's very callous. 
[01:52:00]  You know, because we can't finger pop chicks anymore, we do birthdays and anniversaries.  Yuck.  You want a birthday or an anniversary?  A little bit of both.  Yeah, I think you could do them both, right?  Nah, the birthdays or whatever.  Perry Farrell, Farrell, whatever, 52.  Perry Farrell.  However they want to pronounce.  Well, Frazier's 66.  He's a friend of the show.  He comes in now.  We should have him in again.  He's only in once.  Yeah, he wants to get him in again.  He wants to come back.  Anniversaries, though.  Johnny Cochran.  How many years ago did he die? 
[01:52:30]  I'm going to guess six.  Wow.  Nailed it.  Wayne Gretzky scored his final goal.  I'm going to guess six.  Yeah.  Oh, fucking.  God, fucking boy.  As soon as that verdict was read, God's like, let the lump begin.  When did Wayne Gretzky, how many years ago, did he score his last goal for the hockey people?  11 years.  Are you on the same shoes?  I was just going to say 11.  12, actually, but close enough.  Yeah, I remember it.  That's 12 years ago.  I remember what I was doing when I heard about his fucking last goal.  What were you doing? 
[01:53:00]  I was having my ass eaten by a stranger.  And the TV was on in the next room.  Ah, shit.  Oh, my God.  But you don't like hockey.  That's the amazing part.  I had my face in a fucking motel pillow.  And my ass was being tongued.  And it was on in the other room.  And my fucking cheeks were being opened by fingers that have held too many crack pipes.  And then I heard fucking Wayne Gretzky has scored his final goal. 
[01:53:30]  How did they know it was the final goal?  Because he said he was retiring.  And then I heard, who's that daddy?  You're brushing over the other part.  The hands that held too many crack pipes.  Yeah.  How does that feel on your honey?  It feels like...  A little callous.  What?  No need to answer now, Jimmy.  No need to answer now.  I'll tell you how it feels.  It feels like you can feel the wig hair tickling your butt cheeks while hands without nails 
[01:54:00]  open your asshole.  All right.  That's too visual.  You're good, but you're not that good.  That's based on something.  You fuck.  Oh, my God.  And you kick it.  Wow.  Holy shit.  It feels pretty callous.  It's all right.  I know.  An eight-minute bit that should have been 11 seconds.  Oh, shouldn't have ever been.  It really wasn't awful. 
[01:54:30]  Horrid.  I want to see him do that on Def Jam in 1988.  Catch a good shit thrown at it.  That's why I love him, too.  Oh, that's fucking funny.  Camel toe pad for women?  Yes.  Boo!  Boo!  Unless it makes camel toe from flat, ugly pussies.  I hate a fucking flat, ugly pussy.  Take your sidewalk crack and make it a ditch.  That's what fucking this camel toe pad should do.  Camel toe pad sounds like a great apartment. 
[01:55:00]  My camel toe pad.  Everyone over there has a cunt that can hold a turkey in it.  I guess you don't get a choice today.  Jimmy's already decided.  I don't care.  It's great.  I love camel toe pad.  Absolutely.  So, we got this.  A few years ago, I was getting ready to go out, and I was wearing these trousers, these  white trousers I have on now. 
[01:55:30]  And I just happened to catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror before I left the room  and thought, oh no, I can't possibly wear those.  What women said to me was, even the women who hadn't experienced camel toe themselves either  knew of somebody who had or had noticed it in other people.  And the women who had experienced camel toe, what they really wanted was something, first  of all, that wasn't a disposable product, because that would remind them too much of sanitary  products.  But they wanted something that felt comfortable. 
[01:56:00]  A lot of thought and design has gone into the smooth groove.  From my cock.  It's made from a medically-grade polymer.  Exactly.  I'll just lay my cock in there.  It's a smooth groove.  It's the nature of its use.  And the polymer also contains an antibacterial agent, which means it's hygienic.  That disgusting hole.  It's a bacteria-ridden hole.  This woman's awful.  She has camel toe and hair like Shelley Duvall.  She should be beheaded.  She's fucking horrible.  Nice oval head, bitch. 
[01:56:30]  Jack hit her with the axe between the legs.  Now she's got to put that pad on there.  Just going to bash your cunt open.  I can wear one on his chest.  Scott Van Crotter's chest protector.  And what smooth groove does is it gives you that little bit of extra confidence.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, her fucking dopey, stringy, anorexic girl hair.  It's great.  But I'm not vomiting all over myself on purpose.  My giant vagina is showing to everyone.  I have camel toe and a skirt. 
[01:57:00]  She walks in and gets sucked in like the fucking door's being opened.  Just go out with your gas showing.  I couldn't agree more.  I can't take it, Jimmy.  Looks like she has a midget's arm on each side of her pants.  They would call me names like Fat Pussy.  And I couldn't think of a second one.  They would probably call it to me if they had improv skills.  Holy shit.  I hate this fucking camel toe.  What is this?  This is awful.  And it fits in the pants?  That's just dumb.  Yeah.  It goes in the pants. 
[01:57:30]  Having girls figure that out?  Do they get a little cardboard or something?  Yeah.  A gaff or something?  A surfboard?  Whatever.  Dug tape.  She should tape it to her head like a mohegan.  Run around yelling, hi-yah, buddy-yah, whatever they noise in it.  It has little designs that make it look like it's kind of a pooh-key.  Like it's cool?  Look, it looks almost like a pooh-key.  Yeah, it is.  It's kind of a vaginal.  That's where the clitoris would go, right there.  Yeah, yeah.  It should be something smooth, though, if they want to get that much.  Like an ice skating rink or a fucking driveway. 
[01:58:00]  How many think they've sold to this thing?  I don't know.  Hopefully one to her.  Her fucking hair is enraging.  It really is wispy.  It's horrendous.  I hate it.  It's like frayed jeans, or bangs.  It just looks like frayed jeans.  Yeah, she has fucking tassels over her face.  She is fucking terrible.  It looks like her forehead is wearing a pasty.  That's so ugly.  It's horrible.  That is awful.  I hate flat hair.  This is a reporter.  Ann sees it every morning when we're trying to get ready for a show. 
[01:58:30]  I yell at the TV.  This one, she's like a little Irish reporter that could look hot, but she has the flattest  hair on TV.  Stop fucking putting in conditioner and forgetting to rinse it out.  It's not going to work.  Instead of worrying about her fucking pussy showing, she'll be fixing that straight spaghetti  hair.  That fucking uncooked spaghetti hair.  It's fucking horrible.  Old angel hair pasta bangs.  People look at my head and throw warm water on it.  And put meatballs in my ears.  We got it, Jim. 
[01:59:00]  Meatballs.  Uh, well, um, yes, this is, uh, this is for camel toe.  And that reminded me, cause she said she didn't want it disposable because people would get  the idea of some kind of sanitary thing like a, a Kotex or, or a, um, a, uh, a wee-wee pad.  Uh, do you, have you seen the commercials with Whoopi, uh, just extolling the fucking virtue  of pissing herself?  What?  She, yeah, she does these things.  Can we find this?  Is it for poise or one of those adult fucking diapers, but it's not really a diaper. 
[01:59:30]  It's the pad that she's got to wear all the time cause she, she pisses her pants.  Is she incontinent?  Yes.  Do we like her or hate her now?  I like Whoopi.  I mean, I like her more now that I know she's incontinent.  Yeah, she's constantly pissing.  I respect that.  Why is she peeing herself a lot?  Uh, Whoopi Goldberg.  Cut it out, Whoopi.  Yeah, there it is.  Look, she talks about it.  She says she pisses herself.  Why would you do this?  You know, I, I have a problem.  Every time somebody comes close to me with a dying torch, I get nervous and f*** a little 
[02:00:00]  spritzer.  I went, and my gulp, such a puddle.  And when I laugh, I kind of spritz.  I've been leaking for years, years.  Ew.  Somebody will give you a bit of a tickle, and then the next thing you know, boop, you're  wet.  I don't want to be painted.  I want to be dry.  Anybody want to tell me what's going on?  No one wants to talk.  One in three women have this issue.  I know that someone has created something fantastic. 
[02:00:30]  It looks like a really thin little napkin.  It's called poise.  Let me show you what I would have looked like if I had poise.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Liberty.  Liberty.  Not a laugh to be had.  I don't know if that's really her saying that she pisses her pants.  Yeah, she does.  Really?  Yeah, but she does it in character, so she could say, no.  Exactly.  That was my character.  Like Mr. Amos.  I don't piss my pants, but she actually pisses her pants. 
[02:01:00]  She should do it dressed like a hen, talking to those other hens, pissing all over the  eggs.  She's just pissing in the seat.  She gets up off the couch.  It's a big wet spot.  Oh, God.  She wears white pants.  That's it.  That's great.  So apparently Whoopi Goldberg.  Peas or pants.  That's what I got from that.  Pop!  Poppy!  It's like, poppy!  But the Mona Lisa wasn't black.  No.  Wasn't she doing the Mona Lisa?  And neither was the Statue of Liberty.  Oh, she's copper, though.  She was dressed.  She's copper, though.  That's close enough. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, that is true.  Unless you're green.  When it ages.  Yeah, it ages.  I guess I find patina on it, I believe is what it's called.  How about you just say it turns green?  Well, I know.  Educated fuck.  Oxidized copper.  What is it called?  Patina.  Fuck, that's going to help my crossword puzzle.  Yo, man.  I was going out with a girl named Patina.  I don't know how Pepper Monaki says her name should be Whoopsy.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That is funny. 
[02:02:00]  We should be Whoopsy.  All right, we'll do one more before break.  You got a choice.  The Fat Ho Burger.  Fat Ho Burger.  Sounds good.  Or the drunk lady that can't say alphabet or count.  Even better, Whoopsy Gold Drops.  That's a veteran.  Very good veteran.  What, he just fucking knocked Pat out of the circle?  He fucking took a little of Pat's and added to it.  That's what they do over here.  It's a feeding frenzy in that room.  Yeah.  Does Pat lose on that battle?  No, he gets an assist.  An assist? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  An assist.  Assist.  I got an assist on my toe.  They removed it.  Get it?  I didn't get it.  Now this guy's saying the Brock thing is...  Well, let's go to Rock.  Oh, it fits a name.  Ryan, Long Island, you're on the O&A and J Show.  Good evening.  What up?  Hey, I heard that the whole thing was, in fact, orchestrated and that Brock could actually  still be working for a match. 
[02:03:00]  Originally, Vince had it all figured out that Undertaker and Brock were going to work WrestleMania  and Brock was going to get this huge payday and he was going to be like the main celebrity  of WrestleMania.  And they actually had the thing orchestrated for the press conference when Brock, if Brock  won the fight, Undertaker's going to confront him in the press conference and it's all  at work and he's still working.  If Vince McMahon can pull this off, he could surely take down a plane.  I'm driving.  Love that.  Well, let's slow down a minute. 
[02:03:30]  Dana White would never allow this to happen.  Hold on.  And if he found out that Brock was doing this behind the scenes or whatever, he would be  fucking living.  It's nonsense.  Sir, this is just...  But the other angle, if it was for real for a big payday for everybody and then maybe the  whole thing fell through, then Brock has to save face and then talk about it.  I don't know.  I guess...  Because what's suspicious is, sorry, in that interview that we just played,  he doesn't really say what the actual beef was.  It's very vague and very gray. 
[02:04:00]  Why not just say it?  Because maybe they hooked up with the same girl or maybe it was over something that involved  somebody else's privacy.  Why isn't the professional in wrestling in here to even tell us anything?  Oh, is he prepping for his show?  He's actually out getting coffee and food for you guys.  Oh, good.  There you go.  That's a great...  Now, there's a great example of why this doesn't work.  Sam knows everything about stupid wrestling.  And to have him in here for a couple of minutes to talk about it and see if he thinks this  is a work and shit like that, boring, but it might be informative. 
[02:04:30]  Well, actually, right now is when we could have used Sam and I did not know he was out  getting stuff.  It's a perfect example.  Well, I mean, we can make all the jokes we want, but this is what we're trying to tell  the guys down the hall.  There are times you're fucking up our show because now we do need Sam.  We didn't know he was out.  He's getting coffee.  He's doing something that an intern would do, getting stupid fucking coffee for us  because we're coffee divas.  Coffee divas.  But this is what we're trying to tell the people down the hall.  You're hurting our show by not allowing interns to do some of the busy work so these guys 
[02:05:00]  could stick around and do real shit for our show.  It trickles down.  But you can look into it.  The thing was is David wasn't going to let it happen and Brock...  Actually, there was talk that Brock wasn't going to do MMA very much longer, and that's  why they're saying he's still building so that way when he's done with MMA...  Oh, God.  Is it still real to you?  Is it still real to you?  Yeah, dude.  I believed Brock.  Again, I could be naive, but I don't think that it was a work.  Because that idiot said that to him as he just lost the heavyweight title. 
[02:05:30]  We're lucky to have him in tomorrow, so maybe we could get into it a little further.  I'm going to ask him angrily with my finger in his face.  That's good.  Oh, shit.  What I don't understand is Brock just lost the title and then he got an undertaker in his face.  Why wouldn't Brock lose his shit right there?  Because I think he was just...  I think that he was...  And he even said Kane knocked him into a city he didn't record.  I really think that he was just...  He just lost the belt.  You're not thinking of that nonsense.  Yeah, okay.  I mean, picture...  Good point.  Good point.  Picture it like you're getting fired, you're walking out the door, and some dumb radio guy  you had a fight with five years ago said... 
[02:06:00]  You're like, what?  Point taken.  Point taken.  I think that was it.  I mean, because Kane really fucked...  What, sir?  I just said love the show.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, buddy.  It's not work.  All right, Ryan.  Well, who knows?  We'll ask him a little...  Yeah.  We'll ask him about that rumor.  There you go.  There's our question, Mark.  I have a bunch of questions for Brock.  No, you don't.  I certainly do.  No, you don't.  Give me one.  Hold on.  Let me open this.  Did your...  Let me open it, motherfuckers.  You got a Brock Lesnar file on your computer?  I have a bunch of questions I was writing. 
[02:06:30]  Who have you beat it up?  I didn't say it like that.  Hold on.  Where is it?  It's just a file called Brock.  Are you mean in real life?  Is that a fake file where, you know...  No.  Some good stuff is...  He's just going around.  He's going to punch up one of the pictures of his big dumps or his cock and spin it around.  Oh, Jim.  We don't believe you anymore, Jim.  I know.  Hold on, motherfuckers.  You're a liar.  No, I'm not.  Women's basketball. 
[02:07:00]  Look how silly it looks.  They are so silly, aren't they?  God, with their tits.  Just cut the malarkey.  And brought it to the show yesterday.  Yes.  How much he loves the women's basketball thing that's happening.  These chairs are fucking ridiculously uncomfortable.  Hold on.  Aren't they bad, though?  You're uncomfortable today, huh?  Here it is.  No, it's like...  You're never up and down as much as you are.  It's fucking killing my ass.  You're uncomfortable today.  Travis, you say a quick look.  My ass is killing me.  You got a bony ass?  I was sitting down too long yesterday.  That's right.  All right, why don't we take a break and figure all this out?  Jackie the Joke Man will join us next. 
[02:07:30]  We also got to talk about Donald Trump.  He's taking this birth certificate thing pretty far now.  Yes.  He's showing his own, apparently.  By the way, on Snopes, they were saying that his birth certificate has been shown.  Yeah?  I believe, yeah.  Where is it?  I think they're saying they've shown it.  Yeah, to who?  I didn't see it.  Oh, wait a minute.  I don't care.  I forgot.  Yeah, whatever.  Cool.  Go to Snopes, Ant.  I did.  You like Snopes.  And we got Donald Trump Jr. in tomorrow, who's a very nice guy. 
[02:08:00]  Thursday.  Thursday.  I'm sorry.  He used to live above me, but he's not there anymore.  You moved out?  I think he did.  Donald Trump Jr.  You got any big celebs in your building these days?  I don't know.  Steven Tyler's not there anymore.  You had the Japanese Yankee guy in there.  I had Hideki Matsui.  I saw him the night before.  Matsui.  I only saw him in the building twice.  Or once.  It was the night before the final game of the World Series.  Here she is.  What did you buy?  I wanted a yogurt with blueberries and a Starbucks.  Why is the yogurt so big?  I had to get you a big yogurt.  Why?  Because they didn't have the small ones. 
[02:08:30]  A big yogurt.  So instead of four small ones, I got one big one.  Uh-oh.  That's going to be a problem, Jimmy.  Yeah, because now I have to open it.  I can't have one that's sealed.  Well, I mean, what are you going to do?  Oh, God.  That's a vat.  Who's going to eat that?  That's a vat of yogurt.  We'll share yogurt.  We're not sharing yogurt.  We can lose enough for everyone.  No, there's not.  I eat all my yogurt.  Jimmy doesn't share.  I don't share yogurt.  Where's my yogurt?  No, no, no.  There's one big one.  I thought we'd put it in the bowls for everyone.  Jimmy is not going to allow that.  I'll allow that, yeah. 
[02:09:00]  But I'm just tired of his fucking family-style life.  Because you live at home.  It's a buffet.  Exactly.  Why don't we get a lazy Susan for the fucking studio?  A lazy Susan in the middle to spin our food around.  So we could share.  Everyone have a little everything.  Where's the spice rack and meatballs?  I've always hated that.  It's like, let's just get a bunch of stuff and we'll all share and split it.  Yeah, why isn't Susan doing our homework?  She's so lazy.  That's pretty good, Chip.  I know. 
[02:09:30]  We're going to get some bowls.  Stop saying bowls.  Hot luck dinner.  And then everybody gets some yogurt.  No.  I hate your idea.  Did you wash the fucking blueberries?  I just got back.  I know that, but why do we have to have dirty blueberries?  Why are you calling them blueberries?  Filth-ridden.  That's weird.  I don't eat unworst blueberries.  Unworst.  I like them worst.  I got coffee, too.  I want coffee.  I want my fucking medium coffee the way I always have it.  I got a tape today.  Boom.  Why do I get the big one?  I wanted a small one. 
[02:10:00]  You have a big one.  No, the post that said large.  I'm plump.  This is kidding.  Feisty.  Jimmy just goes there.  Larger's milk, medium, and fat-free.  Boom.  Holla.  Holla indeed.  Boom.  We needed you for wrestling knowledge, but now it's too late because you had to do the  run, and now we have to take a break and get Jack and the Joke Man in here.  So they ruined the show today down the hall.  Yep.  They did.  Not us.  Is that like when you needed me for a scorch, and I was doing a run?  That's true.  I don't like your fucking runny nose, by the way.  Scorch.  I had to go outside to get yogurt.  Jimmy.  I want to know about scorch.  This was the second fucking time that we needed somebody, and they were busy doing 
[02:10:30]  Sam Roberts.  Intern stuff.  Intern stuff.  I forgot about that one.  Why?  What was Sam doing last time we needed him?  It was on a run.  You want to do scorch before the break?  Please.  I want to hear a scorch.  I just don't want to lock him.  Okay.  We want to.  All right.  Jackie, we'll get in in a few minutes.  Yes.  We will definitely get Jackie and the Joke Man in after the break.  Indeed.  Honestly, he's not going to give a fuck about this.  It has nothing to do with him.  This is personal.  Yeah, he's going to.  This business is personal.  Where's my bowl? 
[02:11:00]  Ah, shit.  I didn't get bowls.  Exactly.  You're talking all this shit about bowls, and I'm just looking at my fucking giant vat of yogurt.  I assume there'd be bowls.  Sam, the coffee's not going to walk itself over here.  Exactly.  You stink.  What the fuck?  You're right.  Naps.  Yeah.  You're right.  Here we go.  If you're playing intern, you know, spread your legs.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Am I going to get to talking to today?  Nah.  You got to talking to, didn't you?  Once, I got a little bit of a talking to, but I paid no mind. 
[02:11:30]  I paid no never mind to it.  Oh, fucking shocking me.  Oh.  Sorry, I don't want to laugh.  You all right?  Yes, I keep getting zapped.  Your headphones electric shocked you when he got up.  I hate it.  Here.  I don't know.  It is terrible.  I got stuff over here.  Try this.  What is that?  Oh, shit.  No, no.  Don't throw up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is the...  You hit the yogurt.  Oh, that's that duster shit.  That's duster.  That's good.  The leaky Starbucks lid.  You fucking snort that shit in.  Of course. 
[02:12:00]  Why wouldn't it leak?  Is that the walking on sunshine?  Yeah.  Yeah, and you'll be walking on sunshine.  All right, I'll find something for you.  That's all right, buddy.  I'm walking on sunshine.  No, I'll wait.  I thought there'd be bowls here by now.  How much fucking duster do we need?  I think someone...  It's very dusty.  Someone's addicted.  Someone's huffing.  Yeah.  Someone's huffing.  There's literally five of them back here.  Oh, it's Mars, isn't it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's definitely Mars.  Mars is down there huffing.  Huffing.  What is...  Silicone spray?  Silic...  What's that for?  It's for his tits.  I thought he worked out. 
[02:12:30]  What happened?  Nah, he's not doing that.  Oh, shit.  No.  Oh, no, you didn't.  All right, what are we doing?  Scorch.  And then yogurt.  So, Silicone, I'm too tired.  I don't feel like doing the setup today.  Well, give me the one-minute setup on Scorch for the people that have never heard the Scorch.  Scorch stinks.  Play tape.  There you go.  It's not true.  We used to work with Scorch.  We used to work with Scorch at AF up there in Massey Two Shits.  And Scorch, he had his own kind of personality with the show. 
[02:13:00]  He'd talk like this and he'd do things like, hey, it's the kingdom of nakedness, kingdom of nakedness.  And he'd always have little events that he would do that would rhyme.  It was that kind of...  Doucher dressing.  Doucher dressing.  Or alliteration.  Yeah.  So, what Scorch is doing now is something called PFGTV.  It's pretty fucking...  It used to be good.  Now it's great.  Great.  And he wants to be the next Letterman or Leno or Jimmy Fallon or Jimmy Kimmel or Craig Ferguson. 
[02:13:30]  That's right.  He's trying anything.  And it's a little...  He pays...  I guess he pays time for an infomercial and they give him studio time and air time on channels.  It's on the My Network.  Why is Travis Levin?  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  I was waiting.  You're on his website?  Yeah.  So Scorch has this thing called Restaurant Roll Call.  Yeah.  Restaurant Roll Call.  Where restaurants pay to be on his website and you can see, like, their menus and everything.  Sure.  His roll call?  Okay.  Please.  His one restaurant?  It just keeps spinning around and around. 
[02:14:00]  That goes so slow.  Jim, you can see.  Oh, my God.  Look, yeah.  It's...  What about...  He also had a bar crawl that...  Bar crawl.  That featured two bars.  Two bars.  Ridgeway Roll Call.  And here it comes again.  Manchester, New Hampshire is not the biggest city in the world.  Manch, Vegas.  Manch, Vegas.  Then call it something else.  A bar crawls more than two bars.  Well, I mean, generally, a restaurant roll call involves calling more than one restaurant  as well.  But he does things a different way.  By the way, any place that spells themselves Ristorante is a fucking die. 
[02:14:30]  A Ristorante.  How about this?  Yeah.  Scorch's PFG TV is, uh...  What is that?  Supported by great sponsors and by you.  Holy shit.  Is he public television?  Yes.  And he's got a donate button with PayPal and credit cards and stuff.  But that way he can take the money and put it in his pocket.  You think that's what he's doing?  You worked with him for a while.  He's my radio mentor.  He taught me everything. 
[02:15:00]  I know.  So you guys are getting the gist.  We beat up Scorch pretty good.  Yeah.  We played clips of his TV show from time to time.  There was one night I was watching and tweeting in.  Oh, yeah.  It was just way too good.  And I was watching.  It was fantastic.  Have you watched one since?  No.  Yeah.  I got to watch another one.  I'm due.  It's great.  It's great.  I'm due.  So it got back to Scorch.  And now Scorch is making some kind of veiled threat to two radio guys in New York.  Somehow this turned from playful, friendly banter into Scorch really taking this seriously 
[02:15:30]  and getting very angry.  Opie, you said your days of having radio wars were done.  No, they are not.  Because somebody is firing shots.  I like that he has 101 people following him on his PFG TV Twitter page.  That's a lot of people.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Journey of a million miles starts with the first step.  Triple digits.  Not bad.  Triple digits.  Triple digits.  Triple digits.  Yeah.  What would you work?  This is what Scorch said recently on PFG TV.  Are you going to give me some of the yogurt? 
[02:16:00]  Yes, I am.  There should be two bowls.  I thought I asked for...  I thought...  Is there two bowls?  Why are you mixing a plain yogurt?  Because it was watery outside.  Because there's a fucking pre-cum film on the top.  I hate the yogurt pre-cum on the top.  Why don't you both go into the bathroom, drill a hole, and just throw it through each other's mouths?  I said hole twice.  You don't like...  I know.  Why not?  Hole is good.  You don't like yogurt?  No, I like flavored yogurt.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You like flavored yogurt?  I like flavored yogurt.  I like...  What do I like?  Blueberry... 
[02:16:30]  I eat blueberry yogurt, but I don't like blueberries.  You can put...  Banana strawberries.  Could you get the plain yogurt and put the blueberries in it?  Why is our yogurt lumpy?  Ew.  Has it gone sour?  No, it's supposed to be like that.  Jimmy...  Ew.  I can't have it now.  How does it taste?  I just watched Jimmy wipe it off on his own tongue.  Jim, remember, we're sharing.  Give this to the boss.  Okay.  Sharing's caring.  You just licked the lid or something.  No, I didn't lick my finger.  I wouldn't lick the lid.  I don't lick lids.  Then you touched the lid.  No, I didn't.  You sure?  100%.  Disgusting.  I'm very hydenic. 
[02:17:00]  Why couldn't we get a flavored yogurt?  Good hygiene.  I like plain fat-free yogurt and blueberries.  Plain fat-free yogurt?  That's how I eat.  Put blueberries in it for flavor.  What the fuck, Sam?  That's what I asked for.  Why do I have a choice in the yogurt flavor?  Sam doesn't care about you.  He just...  I understand that.  Put fucking sawdust in it for flavor.  Dude, smell this.  No, I can't smell it.  No way.  It's only yogurt, Dan.  No, I'll vomit.  You don't vomit from yogurt?  Why would you eat this?  It's good for you.  Eat it.  No, there's nothing there.  Put the blueberries in it for some flavor.  You need a little syrup or something. 
[02:17:30]  Jimmy eats like a pregnant woman.  That's funny.  All right, here's PFG TV, so...  Put it in the bowl.  So Scorch is...  Don't say bowl ever again.  You sure heard what he said when he was doing his little silly thing he does for his radio show?  Oh, his show at 10.  My show.  He said cock ring today.  He said cock ring.  You'll hear it for yourself in the 10 o'clock hour.  Really?  I like that tease.  Oh, wow.  Instead of conquering, he said cock ring.  You don't say conquering?  I said conquering.  See, is that conquering? 
[02:18:00]  It's conquering.  He says conquering.  Here's PFG TV and Scorch making some threat, I guess, at two New York guys.  They have a lobster mac and cheese that she claims is award-winning.  But he has to do his restaurant thing still.  He's doing a little plug in.  This is great.  Here it is.  As a platinum sponsor, you'll have three live endorsements during the show.  Plus, you'll have a link to your company on the TV show webpage.  You'll get a spot on the Scorch PFG TV family tree.  And it'll be mentioned in our shameless plugs segment. 
[02:18:30]  Great deal for the money.  Your investment, $300 per show.  Per show?  I'd rather be Strange Fruit on Billie Holiday's tree.  He's giving it away.  That's a platinum.  What is...  And that's the top, right?  That's number one.  How much is a spot on that show?  Can we sponsor a whole PFG TV?  How great would that be?  $300 bucks.  Platinum is $300.  How'd you get all that?  Per show?  Gold is $200.  Damn. 
[02:19:00]  You know what?  And that's it.  So you think he's just pocketing that money?  He puts it in his pocket.  Pocket money?  He puts it in his pocket and he buys stuff with it.  All right, listen.  We've got to get this clip because Jackie the Joke Man is waiting down the hall.  Yes.  Come on.  Travis, how long is Jackie going?  Yeah, we've got to wrap this segment up.  How long is...  I mean, all right, here's PFG TV and Scorch talking about us.  They have a lobster mac and cheese that she claims is award-winning.  So there you go.  There will be lobster mac and cheese in the crowd soon from TJ Calvin. 
[02:19:30]  I want to dissect that ringing endorsement.  She has lobster mac and cheese, which she claims is award-winning.  Wow.  Only $300 for that plug?  That's fucking amazing.  Well, Scorch is not going to say anything that's unfounded because he likes to make sure  if he says something is factual, it is factual.  Right.  He says $300 for an endorsement.  To endorse something, you should believe in the product.  We're not going to catch him in a lie, though, is the thing about Scorch.  Oh, shit.  You're right. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  So you know what?  You know what?  I've got to make a correction.  You said there's no way for us to know how many people are on all this stuff, man.  But there is a way that we can tell how many people have downloaded the app.  So how many are there?  We've got 575,214 downloads of the app.  That is such horseshit.  He's lying by 575,000.  He did not say 575,000.  There's no way.  Well, Travis and me both downloaded that app since then.  So, yes, the figure would be â€“ okay, the figure's off by 3, then. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Wouldn't that be a top seller?  Oh, I mean, that would be a huge â€“  That would be a huge app.  A runaway success.  Give me an app that does that well.  Angry Birds.  Angry Birds does as well as that.  Maybe not.  Because Angry Birds, Angry Scorch.  Plus, you'd think if he was in the market of getting over almost 600,000 apps out there,  he'd at least throw a 99 cents or something on there.  It's free.  Oh, believe me, he would be doing that.  Yeah.  Definitely.  1,214 downloads of the app. 
[02:21:00]  Okay, so there you go.  So, half a million people will know where to go just by a touch of a button.  You liar.  You know what?  I wish I had time to do something.  Next week, I'm going to do something that I meant to do, and I just don't have time tonight.  It has to do with a radio team in New York.  So, we're coming at you.  So, yes.  We're coming at you.  Coming at us.  He had a little too much shit going on that day, so he had to wait. 
[02:21:30]  He had a lie about his app.  He had a lie about his app numbers.  Yeah.  So, it's a zero rating on the app store?  Well, it might have been canceled out.  It's not a zero rating.  It just has zero rating.  Oh, it has zero rating.  Yeah.  Well, it has to take time to catch up like you two.  No one has rated it.  All 500,000 of us.  Out of 575,000 downloads, not one guy has rated it?  It's obvious why nobody's rated it, because they've all been too busy on their apps to do 
[02:22:00]  anything else on their iPhone.  Does he get everyone on the same page to just lie through their teeth?  Someone's saying here the app shows between 100 and 500 downloads.  Is there a way to check that?  No.  You can't see how many times.  No?  Not that I know of that.  Well, no, what he does is he just makes these things up on the spot, and the people around  him feel uncomfortable.  Eat your yogurt, Opie.  What do we do with the rest of this?  Have it when you're done.  It seconds.  It says 0% fat.  That sucks.  Well, it's fat free.  We're going to throw it on your back, Sam.  Make you feel at home.  See?  Okay.  I don't get jacked on my back. 
[02:22:30]  I have to do a photo to DC.  Oh, do you?  Where are you going?  Bring your yogurt.  Quick forward to this.  Bring your bowl.  Bring your bowl of yogurt.  Your bowl of yogurt.  If you need a bowl, we can get you another bowl.  Don't say bowl again.  I hate the way you say it.  There's enough yogurt that Ann can have a bowl as well.  A bowl.  I don't want one.  Stop saying that.  Iraq is looking at your bowls.  Bowls?  How do you say balls?  Balls.  Bowl.  Bowl balls.  A bowl full of bowls.  If anybody else wants a bowl of yogurt, there's plenty more. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Kenny, did you get any yogurt?  No, thanks.  Do you want a bowl?  All right.  I'm throwing this at you.  You better catch this.  No, I'm not going to catch it.  I'm going to duck.  Don't duck.  I am.  I'm going to dump under the table.  Because we don't have interns.  I mean, you have to clean up.  No, I'm going to do facilities.  I'm going to sit next to Travis.  It's going to be a real toss.  No, no, no.  I'm not going to catch it.  Are you that bad?  Yeah, I'm not going to catch it because it'll get on my clothes.  Oh.  Just catch the yogurt.  I'm not going to.  In three.  I'm going to move.  It's going to hit the computer.  And then somebody's going to be really upset. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Move over there.  No, I'm not going to do that either.  Yeah, you should move over there.  I'm going to stand real close to Travis.  Just give a little toss.  No.  You're really not going to catch this?  I'm not going to.  If you don't catch it, I'm in deep shit.  Right.  I'm not going to catch it.  All right.  We'll see how much you care about me.  I'll catch it, Sam.  But Travis will catch it.  He's got to earn it.  Move over there, though.  Because I don't want to.  Come on.  Have some faith in yourself.  Come over there.  Good hands.  Good hands.  Between you two, one of you got to catch.  I'm not.  I'm going to.  All right.  I'm going to move.  I'm going to run out of the way of it.  You might have to catch it.  No, I'm going to move out of the way of it. 
[02:24:00]  Toss it wrong.  Good hands.  Good hands.  I'm going to move, just so you know.  It's going to go all over the floor.  Why are you going to move?  You have to understand that I'm not going to catch it.  It's going to splatter on the floor.  Catch it.  Why?  I'm not going to.  If yogurt gets on you, it'll freak you out, right?  No, I eat yogurt.  Then fucking catch the yogurt.  Catch the yogurt.  No, because I'm going to let it fall on the floor.  Catch it.  Everything we've done for you, catch our stupid yogurt.  Good hands.  Who's catching the yogurt?  Someone back up, Sam.  Back them up.  Travis, do you know how to catch?  Yeah, I play baseball.  Girl.  Here we go.  It's going to be a real toss.  Here it comes.  I'm not fucking around. 
[02:24:30]  You've got to use the momentum and swing it a little bit.  Now I'm freaked out.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't just catch it solid or the lid's going to pop off.  So you've got to catch it almost like an aircraft carrier cable catching a plane.  Just in case you fucking drop it.  I want them to have a record on it.  You have to decelerate it.  Decelerate it with your arm.  I'm guaranteeing if it comes this way, I'm going to move so it falls on the floor.  We're just playing catch the yogurt today.  Travis, it's you, right?  Move over a little bit.  No faith in themselves.  Yeah.  All right.  Just catch the yogurt.  Is it weird playing catch the yogurt, not in a truck stop, Travis? 
[02:25:00]  Catch the yogurt.  You're too far away.  Now it's going to be a line drive.  It's going to be a lot tougher to catch.  And Sam's going to run away like a little girl.  I'm going to hope it hits the floor.  Sorry to all the little girls out there.  All right.  Just catch the yogurt.  That's all it is.  Catch the yogurt.  It's all legit.  Catch that yogurt, you bitch.  Oh, shit.  Man.  I grabbed the lid.  Why couldn't you do that, Sam?  No, I would have let it hit the floor.  I would have gone in the opposite direction of where it was going.  Nothing happens.  You're a Mary.  That's four years of right field for me.  Finally. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  Let's take a break.  Jackie, the joke man's next.  Jimmy's leaving us.  I'm coming right back.  I'm going to do a quick one.  He'll be back.  We'll see you tomorrow, Jimmy.  I'm not leaving.  Enjoy the rest of your day.  I'm not leaving.  He'll be back.  Don't go, Jim.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  This is the OPM3 Show.  The OB and Anthony Show. 
[02:26:00]  Got Jackie, the joke man, walking down the hall with purpose, Anthony.  Look at this guy.  Look at the strut.  He's in shape, this guy.  Looking ready to broadcast.  He used to be fat.  Looking trim and fit.  He's got his coffee.  Now he takes good care of himself.  Jackie.  We're saying that you're walking down the hall with a purpose today.  You look all good.  I have nothing but purpose.  Oh, what do you got?  You almost saw that.  You all right?  I've never been to a radio studio before.  That just ruined my rap on you because I said you had purpose today and then you tripped 
[02:26:30]  and almost fell.  Here you go.  And now you're throwing plugs at us.  I can't look too good.  Yo, Chicago.  See Jackie this Friday night.  Friday is April 1st already?  Holy cow.  April Fool's Day.  How the hell does that happen?  So fast.  So fast.  It's the Star Plaza Theater.  Merrillville, Indiana.  Wait.  Chicago but Indiana.  No, it's right outside of Chicago.  Chicago's right now.  So hey, Chicago, take a little drive to the suburbs for a minute.  A little drive to the suburbs for a team meeting.  Wait, is Chicago next to a border? 
[02:27:00]  It's Chicago.  I got to go to Chicago.  Illinois, Indiana.  Stop it.  I've never been.  I know.  I know.  It's great fun.  And our old boss works for Oprah now, so we got an open invite to ruin his...  To destroy his career.  To destroy his career.  Such attitude, that city.  Worse than Boston, worse than New York.  Really?  He's better, however you look at it.  Great fun.  He says we have an open invite, but he doesn't want the Opie and Anthony world to collide  with the Oprah world.  No.  So I would assume it's when Oprah's in Hawaii or something. 
[02:27:30]  When you have an open invite, that means don't come.  Somebody says, hey, come over to my house anytime.  Or like Anthony says, come to my house anytime.  I say that all the time.  He's never fucking invited.  I say open invite.  You're right.  That means don't come.  You're right.  Ah, shit.  Merrillville, Indiana.  The Star Plaza Theater this Friday for all you Chicago and Indiana people.  Jackie the Joke Man.  And then Jackie's the April, what is, what?  The April Fool, every Wednesday in April from 5 to 7 on.  Oh, okay.  Raw Dog 104.  And XM 150.  Yeah, I'm taking calls and playing my Filthy Joke CDs. 
[02:28:00]  It's great fun.  You know, telling bullshit stories about the jokes.  You're going to talk about our April Fool's prank?  I'll talk about everything.  I don't know if you'll talk about ours.  Of course I will.  Ours cost us, how much did that cost us?  Four months, that one?  Oh, was that April Fool's?  Oh, I didn't know.  No, no, no.  The big one wasn't April Fool's.  No, that one was the mayor.  That one cost us two years, three months.  I was going to say.  I thought it.  We also did another one where it cost us four months.  That was the Mayor Menino one.  So me and Ant, even though we've been together 17 years, we've only done radio about 14 of 
[02:28:30]  us.  Yeah, it was a few years off.  We're just kind of skating.  Good behavior.  Yeah, yeah.  And there was another one where we lost part of our gig for 30 days, 60 days, whatever the  fuck it was.  If you had it all together, we've been on the air about three weeks.  Why were you guys never, you were never fired with Howard, right?  No, no.  Howard was fired from NBC.  That was, how much time did he take off?  I think he was off from September until October or something.  I don't remember.  It was only a couple months. 
[02:29:00]  He was fired from one, picked up from another.  God, that didn't happen with us.  No.  We had to wait it out, man.  No.  And then when he was fired in Washington, that was a short one too, right?  But that was depending on, I didn't know him yet, but I don't know whether he was  fired or whether he quit to go to NBC and they said, you know, that was always murky.  Well, that's why we blew it up in Boston.  We knew we had better things happening.  Yep.  We'd already had a meeting down in New York.  We're finally admitting that after many years.  Yeah.  Well, you know, time has its way.  But you know what?  If they didn't fuck us so bad up there, then maybe we would have done the right thing. 
[02:29:30]  It's radio.  Yeah, exactly.  That's right.  Bruce, Brucey Mittman sliding that, that figure across the table on a piece of paper at  me at some restaurant.  And that was going to be my raise.  So he like goes, all right.  And kind of does this movie move where he slides it across.  That is, I've had that.  That is the move, I guess.  That's the move.  Where he slides it and then spin it.  I took a look like I'm looking at my fucking hole cards and hold them.  And I just started laughing.  Why would he do it that way?  I go, stop.  No, why?  Because there was guilt involved.  I go, I expect a fucking bigger figure on a piece of paper if you pull in this slide 
[02:30:00]  the paper move, you know, you don't do that and get a little raise.  It was at a place.  It was Chinese Buffet.  Yeah.  And this was after we really did very well for the station and the company.  And he treats us to a Chinese Buffet and then pushes the paper.  Here's your raise.  He felt guilty.  He couldn't say it himself.  You know, you wonder if they think about or whether it's a move or whether it's in a  manual because I remember one time, I'm not going to say where or when, but the offer 
[02:30:30]  was for five years.  So they had the number for each year and then added it all up and circled it and said, this  is what you're walking away from.  You know, like, you know, what do you mean you don't want to fuck your wife?  You're going to lose your house.  You're going to lose your kids.  You're going to lose your car.  Right, right.  Yeah.  We also had to move because then we said no to that.  We're like, oh, fuck yourself.  And remember the stock option thing?  Yeah.  Where it has to be invested over five years?  We didn't know the stock market back then, but it sounded good.  He goes, look, if this works out, you're going to have a ski house in New Hampshire.  The operative word being. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  But it was like, you just take the stock.  But it was a fight.  You put it in your drawer.  You forget about it.  Cross your fingers.  And then invest it every year over.  Every year you got in at that price.  So it was a scam.  And at some point you start to glaze over.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And this was supposed to take the place of a real big raise.  And you fast forward a bunch of years.  That stock maybe gave us two Gs.  Maybe.  Instead of an actual raise.  He was like, boys, money's one thing.  And he tried to make us seem like we were children. 
[02:31:30]  He goes, boys, money's one thing.  But you'll understand when you're in the business world, as long as I have been, that it's all about stocks, boys.  And the money's one thing.  I understand.  But you have to educate yourself.  Like he's calling us idiots for not wanting cash.  And taking this fucking, you know, gamble.  And then we got a call from New York.  They said, we want to, you know, meet you guys.  Yeah, let's meet with you.  So we took a Friday off.  Came up with some dumb excuse.  Came down here.  And they're offering us the ridiculous money.  So we're like, all right.  And then they hint to us. 
[02:32:00]  They're like, it's too bad you're in a contract.  See ya.  Well, we'll take care of that.  And I winked at the guy like, you watch what we do next.  And then we waited.  I think we waited two months.  And April Fool's.  The only reason we're bringing this up, because you're doing your April Fool's thing.  No, no, no.  Please.  But it all ties together, believe it or not.  So then we go back up.  I think the meeting was in, my dad took us out afterwards, if you remember, Anne.  It was like late January, early February.  It was cold still.  We went up there.  I'm like, fuck, how do we do this?  So this is an exit strategy.  How are we going to screw this up?  Well, they get the guys' hand.  They're like, we'll hire you tomorrow. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  We'll put you on in afternoons.  They were talking mornings at that time.  But then, whatever.  Yeah, just get out of your contract.  But they're like, it's New York.  But it's all in the up and up.  They're like, it's too bad you're in a contract.  We don't fuck around with contracts.  I mean, we're driving back.  I think we were driving.  I don't think we flew.  I'm like, fuck.  We're like, I'll figure something out.  And we're just sitting there doing our show.  Brains are sizzling.  Oh, yeah.  And April.  Oh, yeah.  April 1st was coming around.  And I fucking woke up.  And I said, Ant, listen to this one. 
[02:33:00]  Listen to this gag.  And Ant said, all right, man.  Let's go.  And we did.  And it worked out perfectly.  It really did.  We had to wait a month or two.  Out in the door.  And then we had to make believe we had other offers.  So we had to fly down to Atlanta and make it look good for everybody.  Like it wasn't pre-planned.  That was just to jack up the other offer.  Yeah, it was.  Tell me.  I'm sure there's people out there that don't know.  What did you do exactly?  We went to.  It said Mayor Menino was dead.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That old gag.  Oh, okay.  I did hear it.  Yeah, you're not allowed to do that, apparently.  I guess not.  So they threw us out.  And then, yeah, they gave us an offer to come to New York. 
[02:33:30]  And we're like, okay.  And then another offer came in to go to Atlanta.  And we're like, oh, let's entertain this.  So we went down there.  They made another offer.  And then we go back to New York and go, ah.  Atlanta's looking good.  Atlanta's offering.  Look at you.  Knowing we would never want to go to fucking Atlanta.  But when they are able to boost the price up at the other place.  But then we had K-Rock and NEW fighting for us.  How did that happen?  And, yeah, they made us choose.  And we chose K-Rock.  And then they told us no.  And then there was a Howard conspiracy.  He didn't want us on the same station as him. 
[02:34:00]  I don't know if that's true.  I think it was the sales.  Well, the sales people said they can't sell both shows.  It's always blurry, man.  It was blurry.  It was absolutely blurry.  And then they pushed us over to NEW, even though we chose K-Rock, which was a perfect fit for us at the time.  The good news.  No Atlanta.  Yeah.  That is the classic place of I spent three months there one week.  You know what I mean?  That's like, whoa.  But they kept saying it's just like New York here.  It's a mini New York City.  They were trying to sell it that way.  A lot of New Yorkers moving down here.  New York, New York.  And they were saying this from a redneck bar that was having, what was it again? 
[02:34:30]  Dart night?  Darts, yeah.  Well, hey, I like darts.  But it's the Cheetah 3 down there.  I've never been so frightened.  And we were down there during Freaknik, so that was another thing that was like, whoa.  Negotiations.  You know, when we were going on the E-Channel, on the TV, on the E-Channel, I had a meeting with the woman who was in charge.  I guess she was going to take care of handling me, you know?  And, you know, of course they had no money.  Of course they had no money. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, they never had money.  They had no money.  They never had money.  So she takes me.  I take her to lunch at the Friars Club, and this is her negotiation.  And she says, where would you like to be in five years?  I said, you know where I'd like to be?  I'd like to be the head writer of the most famous radio show ever.  I already have that.  So how much money have we got?  She was like, I'll have the soup.  Yeah.  Good luck.  I mean, it wasn't exactly like that.  But, you know, and then everybody was pissed.  Like, what are you doing asking for money?  You know, they always like, I don't understand. 
[02:35:30]  They kill you for asking for money.  But then once you sign, everything's about money.  Everything's about money.  Who are you talking to?  What is this?  Oh, God, enough already.  Yeah.  It was some business we got ourselves in.  Well, what have you been up to, Jack?  It's been a while.  I have a wonderful joke for you.  All right.  What is the worst thing about fucking farm animals?  The worst thing about fucking farm animals.  The next time you see them, they act like they don't even know you.  Come on.  That's true. 
[02:36:00]  I'm having so much fun, man.  I'm laughing.  I got a young girl friends.  We actually, on my radio show tonight, 7 p.m. Eastern, Jackie's Jocon on Howard 101, I  have the four original Jersey Boys coming in to sing.  It's almost like I have a radio show.  They're going to come sing Al Capella.  We saw them at Imus' thing.  Imus did a little thing over there at the Hard Rock.  They're so great.  They're so great.  You guys are younger than me, but that music, I mean, you know, I finger-fucked my first  girl to that music, you know what I mean?  So it's like a whole, I can smell it when they're singing. 
[02:36:30]  It's doo-wop kind of, right?  It's Four Seasons.  Hi, Jimmy.  Four Seasons.  It's Four Seasons.  You know, it's not doo-wop.  It's Italian, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that might be a generation thing.  I don't know.  It's like Big Girls Don't Cry.  I don't mind the Frank Sinatra.  Do that one, right?  You know, Sherry and, you know, Walkley.  Yeah, a lot of people, you know.  Don't go away.  I'm no good for you.  I don't know if I'd like it if it wasn't drilled into my head, but, you know, when you're  feeling up a girl and listen to that music, it rubber stamps it, man.  You know, I cried.  I went to the Jersey.  But what does your girlfriend listen to? 
[02:37:00]  I'm sure she's not listening to the Jersey Boys.  She jumps out of the car.  How old is your girlfriend?  I missed the opening.  Is she young?  Forty.  Forty.  Which is very young for me.  Yes.  She's pretty.  Pretty young.  That's good.  I'm pretty old.  I like splitting that in half.  That 40 thing.  Oh, jeez.  I like halving it.  Let's not break our arms patting ourselves on the back.  No, no.  Then you subtract four.  And then you...  Yeah, it's like the way Islam does it.  They're like half a man's age plus seven.  That's what Elijah Muhammad would have recommended. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, is that it?  Cut it in half and take away seven.  The best Anthony story as far as girls go was...  Oh, boy.  Maybe I should have wrote this ahead of time.  Oh, my.  The Pediatric Ward.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That girl.  That's a great...  Well, no, one of my girlfriends got...  She was a doctor or she was a patient?  No, she was a patient.  She was a little ill.  Oh.  And when I took her to the hospital, she was having abdominal pain.  It's a terrible Tuesday, they call it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:38:00]  She was having abdominal pains.  Conscious?  And, yeah, yeah, she was just kind of...  Everything worked out fine.  It turned out to be nothing, but she was really, like, hurting.  And, yeah, so we went to the emergency room.  And then they're going to go...  They go, you know, we're just going to admit you and take a few tests and stuff like that.  I was like, all right.  And so she goes, and I'm waiting, and they go, well, just wait until she gets a room,  and then we'll have you come up.  And I'm like, oh, okay.  And I walked up, and I see this big double wood door that's just painted with bunny rabbits 
[02:38:30]  and turtles and bright tempera paints.  And in, like, Toys R Us letters, it said pediatrics.  And I'd look around, like, wait a minute, I think I went the wrong way.  And, no, she was in pediatrics.  So I'm going down the little hallway and looking in the rooms, and there's, like, you know,  a little kid that's just got his tonsils taken out.  Broken leg.  Yeah, broken leg.  You push the door open with your bone in there.  Yeah.  And then I found the room, and there she was in pediatrics. 
[02:39:00]  Did they interview you to make sure everything was on the up and up?  Yeah, yeah, you know, to make sure.  No, they just asked me what my relationship was with the young lady.  It was all legal in New York.  It was legal in New York.  I looked up the laws.  What's more humiliating, though, you talk about the music, like, when your chick makes you feel old  because of what you like.  Like, the music, like, you think that, like, certain music keeps you young, but then the girl you're dating thinks it's old music. 
[02:39:30]  No, no, no.  She likes jack-in-the-box music.  The twist is when you're with somebody young, and they put on their music, and you're like,  It's awful.  Well, that makes you feel old.  What does she listen to?  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about it.  My situation's great.  You know, we listen to the 40.  We listen to stuff that's too old for both of us.  Sinatra.  I love Sinatra.  I hate the guy.  He's a despicable piece of shit.  But then the music comes on.  It's like, ah.  I could do Sinatra.  That's all right.  I wish I liked him.  I don't hate him.  Sinatra's all right.  I like, uh, it was a very good year.  What's that?  Yeah, well, that whole era I'm talking about. 
[02:40:00]  That's all I like.  The big band and all that stuff.  That's great fucking music.  It's just great.  It's just great.  I can handle some of that.  But, uh, when you, when you play some shit, she never says like, you know, wow, you do  go back a little ways.  No, no.  Who listens to music?  You know, run in my mouth.  You know.  Yeah, kid.  Sometimes when I hop in the shower, I take the, uh, the Sonos system in the house and  I turn it on.  And all I'm thinking is like, she's probably listening to this drivel going, what the fuck  is he listening to?  What are you listening to?  Um, well, yeah, kind of a lot of 80s stuff. 
[02:40:30]  Grunge.  The grunge thing?  No, no.  I, I, I sometimes go way back to like 80s.  Yeah.  Like cars and shit like that and stuff.  But, but it's like, yeah, but it's not that bad for you.  You're not the one in the next room in my bed this week.  Go looking for that common ground.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My girlfriend likes fucking like really weird grunge.  Like, like, uh, like almost like guys.  Fair enough.  What kind of, it's like not club music, but it's really weird, hardcore fucking alternative 
[02:41:00]  music.  And, uh, like, I like, like, listen to like Warren Haynes sometimes.  I like a melody.  I like, I like a chorus.  I like harmonies.  I like shit like that.  Uh, so, you know, hardcore stuff.  Which right away makes you an antique.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I, I don't want to sit here and sound like, you know, well, the music was better  in the old days, but you'd be, you'd become your parents.  But you're just kind of like, eh, what are you going to do?  I liked it.  Two point.  Yeah.  So I'm in a movie called White Irish Drinkers. 
[02:41:30]  That's doing very well.  And I don't, I can't remember.  I can't, I, I, I went to the premiere and I don't have five words.  I have six words.  All right.  You know, sneeze.  There you go.  But I can't remember.  Did I tell you guys the great dwarf story the last time I was here, the terrific dwarf  story?  Oh, this great dwarf would have been an oxymoron.  This great actor, uh, Stephen Lang is in White Irish Drinkers.  We know.  And he's so great.  He's on our show.  Oh, was he?  Yes.  Did he tell you the story?  Just a couple of days ago.  No.  He was just in last week. 
[02:42:00]  Great guy.  I wasn't here.  I didn't know about the movie.  Hey.  Stephen Lang's the avatar guy, the big marine guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  But he doesn't look like.  It's a coming of age story.  It's got Peter Rieger and Karen Allen that were in Animal House together.  It's, it's so fun.  And the movie is great.  And it's a great drama.  What are you doing?  And then all of a sudden, it's like, you ever go to a movie and see Fred Gwynn?  You know, it's a serious movie.  And all of a sudden, it's like, Heyman!  Heyman.  And all of a sudden, I come out and it's like, what the fuck?  You know?  You got a big role?  No.  Six words, I told you.  I'm not making a joke.  But you're there.  I wish I was making a joke. 
[02:42:30]  So what are your words?  I'm not telling you.  You've got to go to the movie.  How about one of them?  I'm not telling you.  Give us one of the six.  Oh, one of my words is asshole.  Really?  Come on, Norman.  That's worth a few words right there.  You might have seven words.  You got seven words, sir.  No, it's asshole.  I looked it up.  You did.  But I went to Toronto and I'm saying, what am I doing?  I'm going all the way to Toronto for six words.  That's like, you know, $200 per word.  But it's so fun.  And to get to hug Karen Allen.  I don't know about you, but Jesus Christ.  And she still looks so beautiful. 
[02:43:00]  Who's Karen Allen?  I know the name.  She was in Indiana Jones.  The first one.  All American girls.  Yes, Animal House.  So it always goes to midges and dwarfs, you know?  And I'm hitting it off with Lang really well.  And he goes, well, I'll tell you the greatest midget stuff.  Okay, the greatest.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm checking.  Joke me.  I'm going to tell you guys.  It's 1962.  The movie is Ship of Fools.  And it's the Cannes Film Festival.  And Michael Dunn is the midget that was the dwarf in this movie, in this TV show, Wild Wild West in the 50s. 
[02:43:30]  It's way before you're talking about it.  Oh, no, I remember that, though.  Dwarfs are tiny, angry, horny, and drunk.  Michael Dunn was the horniest, the angriest, the drunkenest.  And, I mean, he just had an incredible reputation.  But he's a terrific actor.  And he's like the, you know, he's the narrator of Ship of Fools.  It's a great movie.  Even worse than, why don't you go fuck your mother?  You know, Hank was made in his image.  Hank was very angry.  So he's about up to your knee.  And here it is, Cannes Film Festival, with the, you know, big deal.  And the movies, they've got a good chance of winning the Palme d'Or and everything. 
[02:44:00]  And it's the big premier party.  And Simone Cineret is in it.  So her good friend Claudia Cardinelli is in.  And Claudia Cardinelli was like Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, one of those.  She was the Italian siren.  You know, she was just unbelievable.  She's like picturesque and low cut and dripping with jewels and reeking of perfume.  Just absolutely gorgeous.  And Michael Dunn is up to her knee.  And he's loaded.  And he says to her, Claudia, before this week is up, I'm going to fuck you. 
[02:44:30]  And she looks down at him and she says, Michael Dunn, if you do, and I find out about it.  I said, fuck you, Stephen.  That's the greatest dwarf story I've ever heard.  I got you.  Is that a beauty?  That's all right.  Was Hank a miserable, I know the name.  I never heard him talk.  I just, I know the Hank the Angry Dwarf.  Everybody knows who he is.  He was, you know what?  That was fucked up, yeah.  15 years on The Stern Show, I wrote notes for Howard. 
[02:45:00]  And the only note I had hanging above me at my desk, I used to say, I had a running thing  where if you're just tuning in and do some silly summary, if you're just tuning in, we're  giving a breathalyzer test to a dwarf in a pink bunny outfit.  I thought that summed up.  I went in to take a leak.  The first time he was on, it was about Easter time.  I went in to take a leak.  And you know when you sense that there's somebody else in the room, right?  And I sense, and I hear, and I look down, and here's this little tiny man dressed as 
[02:45:30]  a bunny peeing next to me and, you know, kind of swaying, you know.  And you know what?  He was a Thespian.  He was from Fall River, Massachusetts.  He had a, you know, Boston accent.  And he'd come in with a seven-up bottle, half vodka, and he was so, because a little  guy like that, a couple sips, they're gone, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  But he was really funny and really fun.  You know, I didn't go to his funeral, this was right after I left the show.  He was so, uh, mean.  He was an angry drunk, you know. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, he was an angry drunk.  What did I have just...  I think everything just kind of went bad.  I don't know, I was off the show, but he was like, uh, you know, they don't live, they.  You know, those don't live this long.  Those things don't live long.  Those things.  Very short, didn't he?  It was kickables.  Oh, God.  But he was a pisser.  Yeah.  Ah, fuck your mother.  Yeah, he would fucking just blurt out the most vulgar, vile shit.  That made no sense, you know.  Yeah.  And his seven-up bottle, you know, one of those big munchers, 32-ounce things, so it was as 
[02:46:30]  big as him, you know.  Yeah.  So he'd hold it, you know.  The bunny suit wound up getting, like, filthy, too.  Just disgustingly dirty.  And he smells, you know.  Booze all over it.  Jesus.  You know, we had a female midget porn star on once.  I can't remember her name, but I guess she's kind of famous.  Bridget.  Was it Bridget the Midget?  We've had Bridget, yeah.  And at some point, for whatever reason, I walked over to lift her up and stand her on  the desk, you know.  Yeah, you've got to put her up on the console, yeah.  And I went around and grabbed her under her arms and picked her. 
[02:47:00]  I am telling you, for a week, I couldn't, you know, not the pussy smell, but the smell  from under her arms, I couldn't get it off my hands from her under arms.  And when I went to pick her up, you ever go to pick something up that's way heavier  than you expected?  I was like, I almost wrenched my back.  She must have weighed.  They're very dense.  Oh, she was dense as hell.  Like a neutron star.  Yeah, right.  A smelly neutron star.  She's like, you know, black box, you know.  I wonder if she couldn't wash under there with those little arms.  Yeah, they probably didn't reach.  She could just get under the tits and as far as you can go, a little T-Rex arms. 
[02:47:30]  That's the, I never analyzed.  Yeah, it might have been.  You were right on.  You might have been.  Yeah, if we're telling midget stories, we should tell ours, even though some listeners  out there will roll their eyes.  But the girl that wanted to get into stripping?  Yeah, yeah, the stripper that wanted to.  We can make it quick.  But Tom Hanks' son was in studio and Jack Black.  Colin Hanks and Jack Black.  Colin Hanks and Jack Black before, you know, they both blew up to become what they are today.  And she called, she goes, you guys.  Oh, she didn't come in.  Oh, yeah, she called up first.  She calls and goes, I want to be a stripper.  And I know you guys know a little bit about, you know, strippers and stuff. 
[02:48:00]  So I want to come in and maybe, you know, strip for you guys.  And maybe you could give me pointers.  I've never done this before.  Kind of like an audition.  Yeah.  So we didn't tip her hat about the.  Of course we brought her in.  Oh, yeah.  And we got her on the console and she started stripping.  How tall?  I don't know.  How tall?  Midget.  Midget.  Just think midget.  Four inches below human.  And how did it go wrong?  Did I or who said, did anyone say anything? 
[02:48:30]  Somebody was starting to.  Or was it the looks we were giving her?  Looks.  And we were critiquing her.  And then I think we asked her to drop fucking panties.  And she wasn't ready to commit the whole way.  She started stripping.  Making long stories short.  She was bawling.  Half naked.  Started crying.  Did you feel like you were picking on a child?  We weren't picking on a child.  It wasn't that fun.  I think she realized we weren't finding anything sexy about it.  We realized this is just like a sideshow thing for us.  Do you understand?  Look at me.  I swear to God.  When you're talking about midgets and dwarves, I am in a good mood. 
[02:49:00]  It's wrong.  How can you not be?  It's just wrong.  How can you not be?  Yeah, prove it's wrong.  Yeah, she started just crying though.  We're like, holy shit.  Now we've got to console a midget that wanted to be a stripper.  She's trying to keep her clothes on now, but they're falling because she's crying.  Did you say, I'm in radio.  I'm consoling a midget that wants to be a stripper.  Yeah, yeah.  Take her down off of there.  I think she smelled a little too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There's a different smell.  It's a different smell.  With that midget smell.  I went to the feast down in Little Italy one time. 
[02:49:30]  San Gennaro.  And there was a little tent.  And it said, you know, freak out.  And I'm like, come on, you guys.  Come on.  Come on.  Wait, wait, wait.  Before you move on from this.  Oh, shit.  Hold that thought check.  Oh, that's her.  That's her.  She even came in with black leather pants.  She's got her hair.  A little lace thing under.  And they were talking about camel tow.  The lace was in.  Oh, my God.  A friend of mine was in Florida and saw a car accident.  And he saw a truck.  And on the side of the truck, it said camel towing. 
[02:50:00]  And that was the name of the tow truck.  And there's this.  Oh.  She's got like a piglet tow.  So she got down her red bra and panties that she put on for the big appearance.  She's got a stamp, a tramp stamp tattoo.  She has a little tits, though.  Please tell me we have a picture of her now.  She took them off the bra.  Then she took off her top.  Look at those tits.  And then you can see in this picture that we're all.  They're both looking down.  They're just reading a magazine.  They're both looking down.  They wanted no part of this. 
[02:50:30]  They are so unattached.  That's before.  Hey, that's before the publicist would have dragged them out with a machine gun cover fire.  Patrice was in.  It was Patrice's fault.  Yeah, I wasn't in that.  Yeah, Patrice started giving a shit.  I guarantee it was Patrice's fault.  Guaranteed.  If Patrice was in, it was his fault.  He made her cry.  But we don't have a picture of her crying.  I guess back then we had some type of morals.  I don't know.  Jesus.  But you lost it.  Anyway, I'm sorry.  No, no.  So I walk into this tent.  And it was not a cage, but a little stage. 
[02:51:00]  It said, the world's tiniest woman.  And there's nobody there.  And there was a couple other real bad things.  A woman with a snake's head.  But it was a snake with a woman's head.  But it was a snake and a woman with her head out of a body.  You know, all fake.  But I said to my buddy, I said, you know, we came in to see the midget.  Where's the midget?  Jesus Christ.  Where's the fucking midget?  The midget.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  I swear to you.  I swear on all the time.  I turn around.  They go to leave.  And when you go to walk in, there's like a podium.  And you know, the back of a podium, like where you put your speech. 
[02:51:30]  Down the bottom of the, the fucking midget lady was sleeping.  Sleeping in the bottom of a podium?  I swear.  Like a speech podium?  Yeah.  She went to sleep.  And she heard every word.  I was like so fucking embarrassed.  And I didn't have a camera.  I mean, she was curled up like feet.  Hey, you paid.  You want to see your midget?  I wouldn't be embarrassed.  That's my problem.  Oh, I love the midget.  You're sleeping like a fucking kitten.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:52:00]  Holy shit.  Did I tell you, did I tell you the, uh, the, uh, shiny new black patent leather shoes joke?  Shiny leather.  Guy gets a new job.  So to celebrate, he gets a, he gets himself a new suit and he gets himself a pair of shiny  black patent leather shoes.  And he goes to a dance.  He's dancing with a girl.  And he says, you know, I like a girl who wears polka dot undies.  He says, how do you know I'm wearing polka dot undies?  He says, I saw the reflection in my shiny new black patent leather shoes.  He has another girl dance.  He says, you know, I like a girl who wears lace panties. 
[02:52:30]  He says, how do you know I'm wearing lace panties?  He says, I saw the reflection in my shiny new black patent leather shoes.  He has another girl dance.  He says, what do you got on under that dress?  She says, nothing.  He says, whew, I thought I had a crack in my shiny black patent leather shoes.  Now I know how fast this show moves.  I was listening to you guys.  You're being so fucking funny and going a mile a minute. 
[02:53:00]  And I said, my old time jokes don't fit.  That's funny.  That's fun.  That's funny.  A little fun.  Talking about Whoopi being the size of a continent or something.  Oh, you heard the Whoopi shit.  Oh, yeah.  Whoopi on the commercials where she's wearing poised pants because she laughs and when she  giggles, she pisses.  We did that one time on the Stone Show.  We all wore the pens and stared at each other and pee.  It was a little pleasing.  It's weird.  A little warm.  It is very odd to leak in and just be sitting there in a chair. 
[02:53:30]  It's odd.  You feel weird pissing.  Everybody should do it once.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's like, oh, well.  But what would she say?  She said when she sneezes or when she sees people.  Yeah, when she sneezes, when she laughs, if someone tells her a joke and she chuckles,  she'll squirt fucking piss out.  Did you guys make that?  Was that somebody's voice and you guys are breaking balls or was that her?  No, that's Whoopi.  She's got a commercial.  Because it sounded like her.  Commercial's running on television.  She actually is selling these poised pants.  She's doing it in character.  So you could.  I think there's another one.  Well, there might be another one where she's not. 
[02:54:00]  So you could assume.  But is that really hard?  Do you think or do you think that she just doesn't want to endorse it as herself?  Maybe she doesn't want to endorse the project as Whoopi.  Look up Whoopi Goldberg is incontinent.  See if she's incontinent.  I'm just curious now.  Because I know Suzanne Somers shits a lot.  Oh, yeah.  Suzanne Somers is a notorious shitter.  I got a good question for you.  Now, we beat up Whoopi a few years back.  Killed her.  I really like her.  I've hung out with her.  She's very funny.  You ever hang out with her?  I like her. 
[02:54:30]  I met her.  She doesn't really like me.  So we beat her up for whatever the reason was at the time.  I like her, too, as a comic.  I don't really like her on The View.  And then, um...  What's The View?  Elo, uh...  Yeah, I know.  Elo, we actually do.  We play a lot of clips on the show.  And then Elo, our old boss, set it up where, you know, Whoopi was going to surprise us.  And, of course, we all folded, like, fucking, you know, tents and shit.  You know, we didn't...  Of course.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But my question to you, did you guys ever have one of those moments where you beat the shit  out of someone and then, uh, had a nice surprise?  It has to be a surprise, not...  Gilda Radner?  You mean where they just came walking in and... 
[02:55:00]  Something like that, yeah.  I remember a Gilda Radner debacle.  That was so long ago.  I was listening.  I was listening for a long time.  What was the Gilda thing?  You know what?  I wasn't there that day, but she left crying.  Yeah.  I think she came in on a Monday.  I think I was there the next day and it was still...  That was at NBC.  Yeah, she ran out of there crying, right?  Yeah.  It was like 1984, 85, something like that.  Yeah, and like 83 or 84.  Yeah, yeah.  But as I remember, it wasn't even rough.  Like, whatever they...  I think that was right when she was really going through stuff that nobody had any idea of. 
[02:55:30]  No one knew about, yeah, yeah.  So she was teetering and...  Yeah.  So it wasn't going to take a lot.  I can't totally remember what the fuck that was.  She probably got the death sentence that day before she came in.  Her special was funny.  Remember her special where she did the characters and she sang the animals, the animals.  She was fucking funny, man.  She was funny.  I, uh, no.  Not the adult by my rendition.  I'm trying to think who...  And we folded on Sarah Jessica Parker.  We killed her. 
[02:56:00]  How ugly she is.  Looks like a horse, that old gag.  And we were beating the shit out of her.  And the guy that was on the set of Sex and the City was a huge fan of our show.  Yeah.  And she was in the makeup seat or whatever it was, hearing us beating the shit out of her.  Oh, he's listening and she...  And he didn't know that we were going to go down that road, right?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, she's like, give me a phone.  And she called in and we're like...  She was not...  Did she come in?  I've never seen her in...  Have you ever seen her in person?  No.  Because I haven't.  Because some people do not look good and then they look great. 
[02:56:30]  She invited us to come down to the set, but it was one of those open invites.  Oh, why don't you come down here and we'll see what you guys look like.  Yeah, we were like, oh, let's send some models down there.  And then we were going to send down male models with flowers.  I just listened to that one because we're going to get the official invite.  I think Sam played that recently.  Did he?  When I listened to it on the way home.  And it was brutal.  We were just like...  She goes, hi, this is Sarah Jessica Parker.  And you hear it in our voice.  We go, no, it isn't.  We knew.  But we're hoping it wasn't. 
[02:57:00]  I was like, wait, the voice does sound like her.  And she's like, you know, I just want you to know that there's a person behind everybody that you make fun of and stuff on the air.  You were saying I'm ugly and look like Ruth Buzzi and that I sucked at the MTV Awards.  And I heard, you know, you were saying these awful things and I just want you to know.  And she said, which was fabulous.  I don't remember.  She had the whole litany down.  He just heard it.  I don't have the details as well.  She said, I wanted you to be able to put a human face to this.  And all I was thinking.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:57:30]  Exactly.  That's our point.  That's our point, Sarah.  We didn't say anything.  Of course not.  And now, there would have been a fucking horse sound effect or something would have played.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's brutal to listen to because we fucking clammed up like two big pussies.  And then when it was over and she hung up, you go like, I think we held our own.  You were trying to sell the fact that maybe we did all right.  And I was just like, no.  We folded like fag. 
[02:58:00]  I was really being serious.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  What a shit.  Yeah.  It was just.  No, man.  Was I really trying to sell it?  I think you're, you know.  No, we didn't say you're ugly.  Oh, God.  Are you so embarrassed?  Yeah.  So embarrassed.  Maybe we don't want to screen what's played at that 10 o'clock, after 10 o'clock.  Well, it's great when you run into people and you have so many people on over the years.  And you run into somebody and like, you know, socially and in your mind, you're trying to  remember, you know.  Right, right.  Did you hit them?  Yeah, yeah.  That's why we don't go out socially, Jackie. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  That's the mistake you made.  Sometimes you have no idea.  Yeah, I don't run in those circles whatsoever, so I don't, I'm not worried about.  Did you yourself have negative interactions?  I'm sorry.  No, go, go, go, go.  Did you yourself have negative interactions or was always, uh.  No, because I was never to blame.  You know, I was never to blame.  Yeah, you're a joke, man.  I'm just hanging out.  You know, but there were people, you know, they'd give you dirty looks and, you know,  just generically didn't like the show.  And again, did you ever hear it?  No.  Nah, nah.  I just know that I don't like it.  You still hang out with Fred?  No, you know, everybody says how badly Fred beats me up on the show. 
[02:59:00]  And then, uh, but he's, he's an actor.  He's the greatest actor in the world.  And it's theater.  You know, I see him, you know, at the Christmas party and we, you know, we couldn't have been  closer.  Yeah.  I mean, we wrote so many songs together.  You guys had Christmas parties?  We had, what, this year there was a Christmas party.  It was great.  It was just great fun.  And it's a, it's a, it's a love fest.  And I'm like, oh, these are people that beat me up.  But, but it's so, I called in the other day and I, you know, we just fuck with each  other, you know, because the whole thing about Howard Sue and Sirius, I said, I hear  you're having trouble with your employer. 
[02:59:30]  I said, well, if you need some expertise, you can give me a call.  And then I guess he was doing a live commercial before I came on the air from the Mini Cooper.  So the first thing I said is I would pay good money to see you get in one of those fucking  things.  You know, you just break balls, you know.  I saw one of those on the Upper West Side two days ago.  How the fuck do you drive that and feel like you're, you're safe?  I got a friend, Father Sniffin.  He's a priest and he got that thing.  It's like a clown car.  The guy's like 6'3".  It's like, how are they selling it?  Just a gas mileage?  I think it's, yeah, it sells like crazy. 
[03:00:00]  Those things are very, very popular.  And you can park them.  If you get an accident, yeah, if you get an accident, you're fucked.  Yeah, I think you're done.  I think you're safer on a motorcycle.  I really think you're safer on a motorcycle because you can at least maneuver, do something  at the last second.  Oh, you know what another awkward moment is when Opie says that a movie is really good  when...  Oh, you found the clip?  I don't know.  Did he?  Did he ever find the clip?  I was hoping he did.  Maybe tomorrow.  Yeah.  We'll find it for tomorrow.  He says it's good and then the whole world says it sucks.  We had Danny McBride in, very funny guy, and we forgot he was in Up in the Air. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  And I said, oh, I love that movie.  Oh, I love that movie.  And the phones and Twitter, everything.  It's like, hey, asshole, you trashed that movie.  Caught!  Yeah.  Caught.  Nailed.  But in this...  I swear, and I'll say it again, I don't remember hating the movie.  And like I said, you hated it so much when he was talking, though, that I've never seen  the movie based on what he said.  Right, right.  Like, so it had to be bad.  But I wasn't trying to, like, bullshit the guy.  I forgot that I hated the movie.  I forgot I hated your movie.  I smoked so much pop for so long. 
[03:01:00]  I see a movie on TV.  You know, I go to the Cannes Film Festival and these festivals.  I went to a movie at the Cannes...  I went to the movies with a girl.  Jackie went to the Cannabis Film Festival!  A year ago, I went to a movie, and I'm watching the movie.  I swear to you, it wasn't until the end, the end of the fucking movie, that I realized  I'd already seen it.  I don't mean the first few...  Like, by the end, I'm like, oh, yeah.  Oh.  Because you see so many movies, and you're so stoned.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah.  You know.  And it wasn't that good.  I'm sitting through the whole fucking thing. 
[03:01:30]  Just because we...  White Irish drinkers, though, that's a good one.  I'm going to send...  If I send over a DVD, will you watch it?  Yeah, I'll check it out.  Hell, yeah.  I told, what's his name, Steve, and I would check it out.  We have the Sarah Jessica Parker Club.  Is it short?  No, the part...  No, it's not short, but we can just play it, and, you know...  I mean, the beginning is funny.  Did you know immediately that it was her?  Well, let's play that part.  Well, at the beginning, you can play it, then.  Let's play that part.  Because it goes on forever.  Because I wouldn't know her voice.  She just lambasted us.  She killed us.  Yeah.  Sarah Jessica Parker. 
[03:02:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Who's this?  You're not Sarah Jessica Parker.  Oh, these are the fellas that were just trashing me.  Are these the guys?  Are you Sarah Jessica Parker?  I am indeed.  Now, how do you prove that?  How do I prove it?  I don't know.  How does one prove their identity with the phone?  It does sound a lot like you.  I've got to say that.  Do you listen to our radio show?  No, I don't.  As a matter of fact, my trailer driver had it on, and I was fortunate...  We're the show of trailer drivers, apparently.  The timing was absolutely beautiful for me.  Can you pause that for one second, though? 
[03:02:30]  Sarah Jessica...  I didn't say trailer driver, did she?  At this point...  At this point...  At this point, do you know it's her?  Yeah, yeah.  That voice was like, oh, that's right.  How do you transport horses?  Oh, shit.  That's so funny.  Trailer driver.  I didn't even think of that.  I was thinking the trailer from the fucking...  Obviously, the trailer from the set, but...  I don't want to play our old tapes in front of the great Jack of the Jackman.  No, stop it.  Trailer driver.  Trailer driver.  Yeah, but we...  And now, after crashing and burning when she called you up, now you're Monday morning 
[03:03:00]  quarterbacking because you missed it.  We missed the fucking line.  Because we were newbies.  We were still green.  Oh, I would have missed it, too.  It's raining.  I missed the trailer.  Pull your tail in from the back door.  Is this her?  My favorite part so far is you being hopeful going, do you listen to our radio show?  No.  The fucking filthy trailer driver.  I was hoping to get the big call to join the Sex and the City cast.  It's going to be out of radio.  All right.  Is it really you?  Do you shit standing up?  Yeah.  Come on. 
[03:03:30]  Don't worry about it.  It's all a bit.  Like, what's in your mouth?  Oh!  Ah!  Ha ha!  Yeah.  Great.  We're coming out with jokes fucking eight years too late.  Eight, ten years too late.  She didn't sound pissed pissed.  No, she handled it like that.  She said it like, set the record straight.  She just talked it out and was like, you know, at times saying, you know, it's really...  Why would you do such things?  Like, she's like, kind of waving her finger at us.  Like a school teacher.  Yeah.  Very school teacher.  Not angry.  Not yelling. 
[03:04:00]  And I think that's what made us kind of go...  If she got mad and started yelling, we'd just be like, shut up.  But she was like, very civil and just kind of giving us the business.  They gotta have a good sense.  Do you guys know the creator of that show?  Do you know Michael Patrick King?  The guy...  He was a comic.  He was a Philadelphia comic.  He was partners with Dom Herrera's wife.  Really?  Dom Herrera.  Yeah.  Good old Dom.  He was married to Lisa Mendez and they were a Michael Patrick King and Lisa Mendez in  1979 and all of a sudden, boom.  Jimmy, you want to hear a little more of this?  Yeah, that was my favorite. 
[03:04:30]  Do you listen to her?  Yeah, I love it.  Yeah, a little more.  Just a little.  I want to hear you, Cal.  I hate the old tapes.  Go ahead.  It does sound a lot like you.  I gotta say that.  Do you listen to our radio show?  No, I don't.  As a matter of fact, my trailer driver had it on and I was fortunate enough to do it.  Timing was absolutely beautiful.  Poked my head out of the oats bag.  Sarah Jessica, I gotta say, your performance on the MTV Movie Awards, fantastic.  I thought you did a great job.  I loved the costume changes. 
[03:05:00]  We had just lambasted effort.  Did I see the one at the end?  At least 45 minutes.  What?  It's Sarah Jessica Parker.  You don't have the balls to actually say to me what you said to your maybe limited audience?  Come on, buddy.  Limited audience?  Come on.  We get more people listening to this show than watching that Sex and the City.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you certain of that?  Positive.  I watched the...  Hey, guys, listen.  Listen.  I watched the...  Take it easy.  It's all right.  You're absolutely entitled to an opinion.  I just thought it'd be...  I just thought maybe I'd put a human faith to...  Oh!  See, another opening. 
[03:05:30]  Another opening.  Slam shut.  I thought you were really hot in L.A. Story.  That means the world to me.  Thank you.  She's cool.  Come on.  Oh, you were great.  The square pegs.  Hey, you know...  That means the world to me.  You know how tough it is to call on the phone to a radio show?  It really is.  She's right there.  No, it is tough.  You know, with a few people on...  You know, because you've got a bunch of minds that are ready to pound away.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's...  The fact she called in, you got to...  That's pretty cool.  That's very...  Yeah, she was... 
[03:06:00]  I think.  I'm not defending her.  I'm not trying to fuck her.  We also had Nathan Lane call.  Remember?  Because he saw our billboard on top of a cab.  Said, who are these fucking guys?  And just remember that guy?  He just called him for no reason.  He just called him for no reason.  Was he funny?  I don't remember if he was funny.  I'm sure he's funny.  I don't remember that.  He can't not be funny.  I don't know if he was on the show.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't know.  Who knows?  You guys really stood tall, though.  I thought you were hot in that other movie.  We folded completely.  I would have, too.  It only got worse than that, too.  I thought that was balls.  We got more listeners than you got viewers. 
[03:06:30]  That was, you know...  It's probably a huge lie, too.  Oh, of course.  The series went on to be kind of popular.  I seriously doubt that.  We showed her.  She's been in about 10 movies since, and we're still doing the same old shit.  Oh, God.  Amazing, right?  Bringing up the same old stories.  Speaking of which, I got a joke for you.  Yes, Jackie.  So it's Sunday morning.  It's Sunday morning.  It's a knock on the door.  The guy answers the door, and the guy at the door says,  Hello.  I'm a Jehovah's Witness, and I have stories to tell you.  The guy says, Oh, come on in. 
[03:07:00]  So the guy comes in.  Jehovah's Witness sits in the living room.  He says, Let me get you a cup of coffee.  He gives him a cup of coffee.  He gives the Jehovah's Witness a cup of coffee.  He says, Now, what are these stories?  What are these stories you have to tell me?  And the Jehovah's Witness says, I'll be fucked if I know I never got this far.  That's a good one.  I bring the best.  I know you hate my jokes, Norton.  I know.  You think that, but I really don't.  I'm going to poke you in the nose.  I know you don't like me.  I can tell you, but I really don't.  I love you.  You don't.  I love you.  But I really do.  I haven't seen Otto in a million years. 
[03:07:30]  Is he healthy?  Is he all right?  Yes, he is.  He texted me, actually.  He's coming on next week, I think.  Oh.  Yes.  He's a good man.  Otto and George.  Quite a while.  You don't think Jackie likes you?  No, I know I isn't.  But I love Norton.  What?  What's going on?  So fucking funny.  Obi couldn't have just left that alone, by the way.  He couldn't just leave it away.  No, no.  He licks for that.  He couldn't just leave it alone.  He really thinks I don't enjoy his jokes, though.  But that's not true.  No, I have to say that.  I have to say that.  Yeah, he says that.  He says that every time he's in.  I was mad at myself.  I'm sitting in the other room laughing at you guys.  I'm like, don't laugh at these guys. 
[03:08:00]  You're not supposed to laugh.  It's so funny.  You guys are moving a million miles an hour.  I love it.  They weren't half asleep today.  Whoopi peeing herself.  I don't know what happened there.  The Whoopi call is better than the Sarah Jessica Parker.  She called in?  I have no idea.  She came in.  She came in.  She called in and she hung up on us when I asked her about Ted Danson.  Right.  Because she had wanted I Miss Fired.  She wanted I Miss Fired.  And we're like, look, you did.  Blackface bit.  She was part of it.  Was that off the air that happened?  What they did was so fucking funny and harmless. 
[03:08:30]  We did a whole parody of that on our pay-per-view on New Year's Eve.  It was fucking hysterical.  Howard was Ted Danson and Sherman Hemsley was Whoopi.  And I was right.  The worst racist jokes you could possibly write.  I mean, the worst, worst, worst ones.  And Howard was reading him and he's so fucking hip and hysterical.  You know that guy?  Yeah.  And he's fucking peeing himself laughing.  It was just so, so off the fucking mouth.  Yeah, there were a few, I think there were a few N-bombs dropped. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, crazy.  You know.  Oh, you're so funny, Ted.  You know.  You're so great.  I don't even know how the hell we got away with anything.  It seemed like, God, it was just.  But it was fucking the Friars Club.  Anything goes.  It was everybody so fucking over-sensitive.  Next thing you know, Midget's going to call up and claim to be Sarah Jessica Pai.  Oh, yeah.  They're already trying to get rid of the M-word.  They call it the M-word.  Midget.  No joke.  Oh, please.  That one ain't going to fly.  Because the M-word, now they're saying we want to get rid of the M-word.  I don't care. 
[03:09:30]  I understand they don't like dwarf.  They don't like Midget.  But to me, fucking little people is more degrading than anything I've ever heard.  I got to agree with you.  Little people.  Little people.  Little is just not a great word.  You see a midget on TV.  He goes, yeah, I was hanging around with a bunch of other little people.  I was like, Jesus Christ.  You're a little people.  At least refer to yourself as a valueless lump.  They also call it a person of short stature, which is too long.  It's fucking, you could just say midget. 
[03:10:00]  Little, you don't want to be called little.  The greatest was fidget.  Fidget from Little Reckles.  The midgets, the fidgets.  The fidgets.  Oh, God.  Ah, go chase yourself.  Now we got Travis found Whoopi hanging up on us.  Oh, Whoopi.  Okay.  Let's see how this went.  This is a quick one, I believe.  Why should radio show hosts that do a comedy show be held to higher standards?  Okay.  As like network news.  Are you crazy?  We should be able to say whatever the hell we want when we do our program. 
[03:10:30]  Excuse me.  God bless you.  She just peed herself.  Now, I'm willing to listen to you, but you know what?  If you're going to talk over me, I don't know who Cheryl Norton is, so I can't comment  on what she does.  No, Cheryl Underwood, not Cheryl Norton.  Cheryl Underwood.  No, Underwood.  You're Norton.  Yes.  Oh, sorry.  Geez.  Hey, what about Ted Danson?  I don't want to comment on her because I don't know what she does.  I'm having a conversation with Ted Danson.  Whoopi, what about the Ted Danson incident?  I mean, you guys caught, you were making a racial point.  No, no, no.  But I'm saying.  Oh, hang on.  Oh, see?  Hang on.  See?  See?  See?  Because you said the Ted Danson's plane. 
[03:11:00]  I wasn't even attacking her with it.  What was the premise she hung up on?  Where did you go?  She didn't like that I mentioned Danson, and she told us that off the air.  She didn't like that.  We talked to her off the air.  She's like, I didn't like that.  Yeah, she said she didn't want to go there because it's old news and blah, blah, blah.  But it was important because it was during the whole Imus thing.  It's undeniably hypocritical, so she had to kind of hang up there because she was nailed.  I still like her, though.  She was nailed.  You know, we felt like Imus was just trying to fucking entertain him and make people laugh.  Yeah, and he never should have dumped that.  Blurts out a line live on the air when you're doing that, you know, off the cuff. 
[03:11:30]  He should never have been fired for that.  Oh, fuck.  It's ridiculous.  And then everybody that just came out and piled on a bunch of hypocrites.  Including Al Roker regrets opening his mouth.  What the fuck, they kill him on Twitter every time that fucking fatso.  Because I Twittered him about that girl.  You guys were fighting a little bit, right?  From the Lady Liberty.  One of the chicks who Imus referred to as a nappy-headed hoe tweeted nasty shit about Japan.  Not trying to be funny.  Nasty shit.  What did you say?  Do you remember?  It was God.  God must have... 
[03:12:00]  It was something about how God was doing it for whatever reason.  Almost like if you had said that about Katrina, you'd have been called a racist.  Of course.  And Liberty didn't do a fucking thing.  She apologized.  They didn't do anything.  And Roker didn't, so I Twittered Roker.  I'm like, are you going to blog about her or does that only apply to white people?  Right.  He said, I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Of course he knows what you're talking about.  Of course he does.  If you just go into the premise that everybody is so full of shit, you will never be disappointed.  That's true.  It really is true.  You know what I mean?  Words to live by. 
[03:12:30]  Words of wisdom.  We just got knowledge from Jackie.  You reach the age of 51, you know?  You're right, man.  You're right.  51.  Suck my car.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  You see it, and especially with the social media and stuff these days, you just see it  more, and you get to see what people are really all about a lot closer, and like you  said, never disappointed.  Wow.  They're just, some people are truly despicable.  That's the only, you know what, the worst thing about the world is, I categorize my friends 
[03:13:00]  as this guy, this is a guy who does what he says he's supposed to do, says he's going  to do.  It's like the Chris Rock thing, I take care of my kids, you're supposed to.  Like, nowadays, it's like, I especially like this friend more than my other friends, because  when he says he's going to do something, he does it.  But you're supposed to, if I say I'm coming to your house in 10 minutes, I don't care if  you're coming, but don't fucking say you're coming. 
[03:13:30]  Don't say I'll meet you somewhere for lunch if you're not, you know?  Right, right.  Don't say, let's do this next week.  Just don't fucking say it.  You know?  People just do whatever the fuck they want, and it just makes you crazy.  There's just a weird sense of entitlement and self-importance with everybody.  Yeah, I'll tell you, though, when I was doing better, they did show up.  Is this, oh, this is lately, oh, okay.  I just realized this is, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding.  I'm going to chase them away in the old days.  I think we've got to get out of here right at 10, because we have a student. 
[03:14:00]  We've got a meeting.  A dumb meeting.  Is it me?  No.  Is it the thing?  Is it the Norton Martling thing?  A meeting right now.  I don't know.  You'll see us march down the hall into a meeting if you don't believe.  Just follow us down that hall to a meeting.  I love coming in here.  You guys, it's just one room.  So it's Chicago, the Star Plaza Theater, actually, over the border in Merrillville, Indiana.  Friday night, right?  Friday night, April 1st.  That's this Friday, April Fool's Day.  You've got Bob Zaney and...  A guy named Geechee Guy.  He's a very, very funny character.  Wow.  I wonder what happened to him. 
[03:14:30]  I never met him, but I know his name for a long time.  He's got a show called The Dirt Joke Show in Hooters Hotel.  I was just out there, and it's great fun.  I hung out for a couple hours with Slayton.  I hadn't seen Bobby Slayton in a long time.  He's a fucking character.  Old Bobby.  I love him.  And I've got a great show coming up the week.  Every six months or so, John McDermott gives me a couple hours.  So I've got two hours on Wednesday, every Wednesday in April.  That's cool.  That's the April Fool.  On Raw Dog 104.  Raw Dog 104.  And next time I'm on...  You know, I've got a whole new life with these, you know, the dirty comedy channels, because 
[03:15:00]  they play the shit out of my CDs.  I've got fans that have never heard of me on Howard Stern.  They just like the dick joke.  You know, they love all the other comedians, but they hear my shit, they can get out of  the car and go tell it to somebody.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, and that's the point.  I'm just passing the fucking baton.  I'm a conduit.  You know that fucking word, conduit?  You haven't said one fucking word to all.  Just shut up.  Did for him.  Not the fuck up.  He has to Google.  He has to go to the Google for conduit.  I don't need the Google conduit.  Conduit.  Yes.  He knows the conduit.  I particularly liked it when he was fucking Chandra Levy. 
[03:15:30]  Yes.  I think you've mistaken that, but okay.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Is that a mistake?  No, it's fine.  He was having a affair with her.  He didn't kill her.  Didn't kill her, though.  They got another guy for that.  Yeah, some immigrant.  Got some other guy, yeah.  I have to just plug Friday the 13th.  This Friday, not mine, but I think it's for the Antisocial Network with me, Attell, Brewer,  and Burr go on sale for Washington, D.C.  Washington.  May 13th.  And we're also in Chicago June 15th at the Comedy Festival. 
[03:16:00]  We're the opening night show at the Chicago Comedy Festival.  And Vegas date to be announced.  We may have to move that off July 2nd.  Oh, really?  Why?  Yeah, because I don't want to compete with UFC.  They have a UFC in Vegas?  They do.  That's right.  We're moving it.  Oh, you got it.  Yeah.  Oh, we were planning on going.  Oh, sorry.  Wait, when was it?  It's July 2nd.  It's UFC in Vegas, and I'm not competing with that.  I told myself we cannot.  It's the same night?  We're not doing it the same night as UFC.  Oh, the same weekend you can handle that.  Oh, the same weekend, but not the same night.  Same night.  Oh, all right.  That's 20,000 potential tickets gone. 
[03:16:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  One more thing.  Every time I'm on here, I get a zillion people signed up from the mailing list.  So if you want to be on the Jokeland email list, it's Jackie at Jokeland.com.  And Jokeland.  Okay.  It just blows up.  Your people love the dirty jokes, man.  And Twitter, right?  You're doing that.  Yeah, Jay Marlowe.  You know what?  I had a contest against a woman.  Just a caller to the Stern Show, and she beat me like 7,000.  I'm not hip.  You know, because I can't get Jackie Martling at Gmail.
