<pre> Alright, you want me to throw out the first F you in or do you have one?  Go ahead, I'll punch up the instant feedback here.  Alright, Opie and Anthony, big F you to OJ.  He wants people to leave him alone then he should die.  He is guilty.  When his kids grow up I hope they piss on his grave.  Wow.  Yeah, what a guy reading in the paper that he's willing to share custody with Nicole's  parents.  Yeah, that's cute.  At least he could do for, you know, butchering their daughter I guess.  You know, what a guy.  He'll throw them a bone.  Throw them a bone, right.  Unbelievable. 
[00:30]
 Speaking of OJ, did you watch When Good Pets Go Bad last night?  I saw part of it.  I saw the big moose.  Funniest damn show on television.  That fox man, they have got something.  Every Thursday night now they do this whole hour or two hours long of scariest police  chases for like an animal thing or a hidden video camera thing.  people caught on the job and they show one girl taking a leak on her boss's big comfy 
[01:00]
 chair in his office.  She's just this hidden camera and she squats right down, pulls her pants down, takes a  leak on his chair.  That's great.  But when animals attack, it was hysterical.  The guy that put his head in the alligator's mouth is like one of these little Bill and  Joe Bob farms down in Florida, sticks his head in an alligator's mouth, probably like  he's done a hundred times.  And a drop of sweat hit the alligator's tongue and snapped his jaw shut on this guy's head. 
[01:30]
 He's screaming it and rolling around in pain and I'm laughing.  I'm just laughing at this guy.  It's great to laugh at this stuff.  It's funny, the moose.  Yeah, the moose, that's the one I saw.  Now what was that deal?  Well this moose was coming up to this, it was a part of the campus, this college campus.  I think it was Alaska somewhere.  And it had a kid with it, a little baby moose.  And this guy kind of walked by and the moose didn't have an escape route. 
[02:00]
 So it attacked the guy.  Just hooves up, bashing him on the head, kicking him and then it goes away and the guy gets  ready to get up and he comes back, wham wham wham wham, just hoofing him.  And I'm laughing hysterical.  Is it true they're going to do a show on people getting hit in the sack?  Hitting the sack?  Yeah, they are.  They're going to do like low.  That's America's funniest videos, though.  They're doing some kind of low blow video.  Oh, we were ahead of our time then.  We sure were.  We know we did a good commercial on that on our Demented World CD.  The funniest outtakes are the ones where somebody's getting kicked in the groin. 
[02:30]
 In the groin.  Very good.  Very good.  Wow.  This fax is, this is tough.  Dear Opie and Anthony, I'm sending a big FU to you guys and all the male population that  has placed the responsibility of keeping a relationship hot on Us the Women.  For example, your Tuesday night Hummer Club.  We also have to do the cooking and cleaning and shopping and raising the kids.  I'm positive that if we women had more help with household chores, there would be more 
[03:00]
 energy for hummers.  So F you guys.  The girls don't understand something.  The club is for both sexes.  Yeah.  And we've encouraged the guys to reciprocate.  Of course.  But it's got to start somewhere.  So we draw the starting line at the hummers.  Yeah.  And you know, guys, ladies, I'm sorry.  We can move into an apartment, put towels over the windows and we have window treatments.  We're fine.  You know, it's not up to us.  I don't know.  Yeah.  We get the Jets classes. 
[03:30]
 We're just happy if we get a whole set.  That's jelly jars.  Jelly jars.  That's all we need.  I still have a Yogi Bear jelly jar that I use.  Drink iced tea out of.  You know, that's just the way we are.  And you're happy that way, right?  Yeah.  That's why we are never, the girls get mad at us all the time because we don't do things  around the house.  But we never get mad at the girls for not doing anything around the house because we  don't expect anything to get done.  Like I get home, I don't notice if the wife has done the laundry.  And I don't go, oh, didn't do the laundry today, did you? 
[04:00]
 You know, because I wouldn't even notice.  I don't even notice that.  No, you would just dig through the dirty laundry to find something that was almost clean.  So maybe that day she didn't want to do laundry and she put it off till tomorrow.  That's her prerogative because I won't jump on her for not doing the laundry.  But if she says to me, hey, take the garbage out.  And then I forget or don't feel like doing it now, I'll do it tomorrow, whatever.  I get jump-tied.  Yeah.  Why didn't you do it?  I asked you to do it.  It's like, geez, I don't ask you to do anything.  I appreciate the fact you do.  But I'm not putting you on a schedule. 
[04:30]
 No.  Well, lovely.  The never-ending battle of spouses.  While the phones are ringing like crazy, we'll go to those next.  FU Friday continues with Opie and Anthony.  Here's one.  This one's brutal, Anthony.  I want to send a big FU to my wife.  Yes, dear, I have been and will continue to sleep with the friends of yours we met through  our son's school.  That's why I don't do you anymore.  I almost forgot what great sex is all about.  The show!  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Kiss, Psycho, Circus. 
[05:00]
 And we have our kiss window this hour.  Excuse me, I'm eating crackers and I got, ugh, you can't eat crackers on the air.  You breathe in and get that cracker dust that goes right down your throat.  Oh, it's brutal.  But we got to congratulate John Seminero of Corona New York.  He's got a pair of tickets to see Kiss.  Congratulations, John.  We're doing that all weekend long for you.  Matter of fact, I'll give you a little heads up here.  Next time you hear Jimi Hendrix doing manic depression, which is going to happen within  the hour, if you're the 10th caller at 212-757-1027, you will score tickets to the sold out Kiss 
[05:30]
 show as well, OK?  All right.  It's FU Friday.  The fact is spilling in like crazy here.  If you're going to send one, please get right to the point because the long winded ones,  we're not even reading because they're just piling up today.  We have to move on with this.  So, the facts line is 212-957-WNEW.  Opie and Anthony, a big FU to a world where franchise players such as Bernie Williams  are traded from a world champion to an expansion team so he can make 20 million instead of  15 million. 
[06:00]
 FU George, FU Baseball, FU Bernie, FU Sports Agents.  That's what we've got.  Wow.  Look at that.  A little ticked off there.  Anthony and Staten Island FU to New York City for stopping traffic again for John Glenn.  Oh, bravo.  Enough with the ticket tape parades already.  Have we done it enough?  And the money that we're wasting on this too.  Money, inconvenience, people work in this town, OK?  There was an article in the paper today that the subways need to be updated.  All right, take the money from the ticket tape parade you're going to throw Monday, 
[06:30]
 screw the parade and throw it into the subway systems.  That'll help a little bit.  I know it won't take care of the problem, but at least it's going for a positive thing.  Enough, enough.  He got his ticket tape parade years ago.  I don't even like the ticket tape parades for the baseball teams or anything.  Oh, that's kind of exciting.  I don't know.  You know something?  Because I think that should be totally reserved and special just for, you know, hey, here  comes the guy that cured cancer.  You know, throw him a ticket tape parade. 
[07:00]
 You're killing me.  I have to disagree.  Why? If you're going to block up traffic and throw a bunch of paper out and waste millions  of bucks, let it be for something good.  You don't think it's exciting when the Yankees are tooling down the street?  Read that FU.  What?  The last one you just read.  True.  Who cares at this point?  It's all, they're all playing for laundry.  Oh, you're killing me.  They're playing for a uniform.  All of a sudden it's just like different, different bodies in the uniform.  Oh, oh.  It's not like the old days.  Our listeners are going to hate us now.  They're going to hate us. 
[07:30]
 I mean, I just saying reserve the ticket tape parades for, you know, the first people on  the moon.  That was great.  Neil Armstrong.  But wait, wait, wait.  When your home team wins, you got to do something.  You got to do something.  And that's what we do.  That's fine.  But to give John Glenn another one, who cares?  You're right.  I don't, I don't know.  I think ticket tape parade should be reserved for stuff that's like really huge.  It's kind of the point where, you know, they'll throw for anything.  No, they didn't give it to Sammy. 
[08:00]
 Sammy Sosa didn't get his now, did he?  F you to Saddam Hussein, we'll get that right the hell out of the way.  See you in hell.  Very good.  He's bending a little.  He's backing down just a tad, just like we said the other day, saying he's open to certain  negotiations.  Where's the, where's the point where we're saying no negotiations?  You either do this or you get bombed.  And he's like, well, if it's fair and just negotiations to this, blah, blah, blah, then  I'm willing to.  And we're like, no. 
[08:30]
 We're going in bombing.  Yeah.  Well, it is a speaking of that, we, we broke the news the other day.  This is a very interesting email guys.  I gotta say, I heard you talking about the Iraq crisis and I had to know more.  I have a friend who is a flight engineer and will undoubtedly be there if there's a conflict.  I turned to other news stations and do you know what I heard?  What will Clinton do now with Monica?  So I got home turned on CNN.  Will the impeachment proceedings be postponed?  What the F we may go to war and friends of mine may die. 
[09:00]
 And we're stuck on Monica.  Who gives a S you guys were the only ones who put the imminent possibility of war before  the private life of the press.  Well, that's all right.  First, I got to say thanks for caring.  Then I have to wonder what's wrong with the rest of the media for all the hype and bull  ass you guys get.  You're the only ones who reported the news.  Keep up the good work, Dave.  Look at that.  Your newsletter, open athlete one to seven W.  N.E.W. the Rock of New York.  Sophie and Anthony on FU Friday.  Judas Priest, you've got another thing coming. 
[09:30]
 Van Halen Unchained and Pearl Jam alive.  The music sounds great today.  Yeah, got to rock and got to thank Andrea down the hallway.  She's taking care of us.  Yeah, we love playing this feels like rock.  Certainly does smells like rock tastes like rock.  We're enjoying it.  Keep it coming, Andrea.  Keep it coming.  All right.  How about an FU?  Yeah, go ahead. 
[10:00]
 Once again, I think this guy gets an FU every week.  Mayor Giuliani.  Oh, now he's starting his underground war.  Clean team cops to crack down on subway litter bugs.  And a bunch of funds you could get if you're you're drinking coffee on the subway, an open  container of coffee.  We need our coffee in the morning.  But I need to drink it on the subway.  I'm a lid on that for for God's sake.  What are you doing? 
[10:30]
 You're going to spill coffee.  And I'm looking at the fines carrying open container liquid such as coffee in a moving  vehicle.  I guess that's the bus or train.  Twenty five bucks.  Come on littering, dumping garbage or spilling coffee, soda or other beverage.  So if you even spill it, 50 bucks creating unsanitary conditions such as spitting or  urinating.  Fifty bucks.  Wait a minute.  Back up.  Yeah, it's the same fine.  Same fine if you spill coffee or soda as it is if you whip it out and take a whiz on the 
[11:00]
 subway.  Fifty bucks.  I think the whizzing fine should be a little higher.  Just a little.  I don't think spilling coffee, soda or another beverage makes the subway smell.  Yeah, I don't mind smelling the coffee on the subway.  I don't either.  I don't mind that at all.  When you're down there waiting to get on the subway or in a corner somewhere and you smell  a little coffee, it's OK.  It's OK.  It's like, wait, it's a grape soda. 
[11:30]
 It's not that bad.  It's kind of pleasant while I wait.  But we all know that other smell, don't we?  Yeah, we do.  That's urine.  If you're caught, you know, taking a leak in public, there should be public hangings.  Oh, public hangings.  Disgusting.  All right, we got a nephew coming through the email.  Lots of email coming in today.  Hey, guys.  I'm a toll collector for the New Jersey Turnpike at exit 10.  I listen to W.A.W. all day.  In fact, my radio broke on Wednesday and I was very upset that I couldn't listen to your 
[12:00]
 show. Well, today I am in the I am in the busiest lane at this exit.  And I want you to tell all your listeners that are driving on the turnpike and plan  to get off at exit 10 and come through my lane.  Lane number nine.  F you.  I don't want their effing crinkle dollar bills.  I don't want their effing pennies.  I certainly don't want to give them any directions.  And no, they can't make a U-turn.  I want to go home just as bad as they do.  So have your effing money ready and don't talk to me.  I want today to be as quick and painless as possible. 
[12:30]
 I've been dealing with these people all week.  You think they know how much they have to pay by the time Friday.  Oh, my God. You know, that's true.  You get behind these people and you see them, they pull up to the booth and then you see  them unbuckle their belt.  They're sitting up in the seat, taking in their pocket.  They're all surprised that they got to pay the toll at that moment in time.  They go, oh, I didn't know there was a toll here.  Yeah, you've only been in a traffic jam for 30 minutes.  Get get it all together.  Hate that. God.  It's the end of a long, long week and I need a drink. 
[13:00]
 Thanks, guys. You rock.  Toll collector, Jessica P.S.  I joined the Hummer Club on Tuesday and was well reciprocated.  Very good, Jessica.  All right. You know, we had a little brainstorming meeting today and we're trying to get some  type of bumper sticker or a pin that we could give all our members of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club for joining. Yes.  And we will be inducting new members this coming Tuesday.  So keep listening to the Opium Anthony show.  Maria writes, F you to any woman who did not induct her man into the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club and had some lame excuse or a nasty attitude about it. 
[13:30]
 I like that attitude. Thank you.  Keep the F yous coming through the fax line.  One oh two seven W.N.E.W.  The Rock of New York. That's our pal Red Peters.  How's your whole office?  C.D. I laughed. I cried.  I fudged my undies.  A good friend of the show, actually.  You know, for a very long time and he's now have I think he officially has the theme song  for our Tuesday Night Hummer Club to office.  You know, oh, boy, yeah, that's off this little ditty as well.  So it's great. Great little ditty. 
[14:00]
 And he's on our record label Restaurant Records.  Don't even talk about it.  I don't care.  It's all in and sell CDs because they're not in the stores.  We've gone through this before.  Well, I got news. Good news, Anthony.  Oh, you do?  Yeah. Well, last week we sold one Demented World CD.  Yeah. In Manhattan.  Yes. This week, guess how many we sold?  How many? Up to seven, baby. 
[14:30]
 Yeah. We're rocking now.  This rate will be 10 in no time.  They don't put them in the stores.  I don't even want to get into it.  No, don't even want to get into it.  You know, Red Peters donated a track to our CD.  Yeah, he did. I got to play this.  Oh, which one is that? Oh, the commercial.  Yeah, yeah, pretty good.  Because it's good for FU Friday to our pal Red Peters, who does.  How is your whole family?  He donated a little track for our Demented World CD.

It is FU Friday. FU to Opie and Anthony.  What? What did we do now?  Hey, how come us girls never get special days for Hummers?  We would appreciate it just as much as you guys do. 
[16:00]
 In my experience, if I do it first, the favor almost never gets returned.  Oh, you know, that's a tricky one with some guys. Yeah.  What's up with that?  And how come most of you guys want to know how we got so good at it?  Yeah, it's great when you're just like dating, like at the beginning.  Yeah. And after a while, it's like, hey, wait a minute.  Yeah. Where'd you learn that?  Yeah, you get a little jealous.  How about if you set aside a special day just for us?  Love you guys.  Anthony, can you explain the Tuesday Night 
[16:30]
 Hummer Club because the ladies feel are feeling left out.  It's a way to break the ice.  We're talking about people that have been in relationships for a while.  It's hard for them to communicate.  They get busy. They get caught up in jobs and home life, kids, whatever.  And it's hard for a guy after so long has gone by without it to go, honey,  honey, I can really use a Hummer.  So we're just asking for them.  Yes. And it's not just supposed to be a hey, thanks.  You know, let me go call my pals on the phone. 
[17:00]
 The guys are so well reciprocate, of course, and do whatever their lady likes.  Yeah, it's just a way to break the ice. That's all.  And the ladies officially become members of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club as well.  And the ladies have been calling saying I'm an official member.  Very proud.  See, we're giving you ladies the whole control of our club here.  Don't you understand?  Yeah, guys aren't willing to give ladies, you know, control of their club.  But Anthony and I will do that here.  Of course, it's all yours.  One oh two seven W.A.W. 
[17:30]
 The Rock of New York, Metallica.  Turn the page.  So be it, Anthony.  I hope you've noticed that the music has changed this week.  A little bit.  We've made a drastic turn for the better this week.  I hope you realize in that.  Yeah, a little.  We're rocking. We are rocking.  It feels like a rock station.  I'd say I must say it feels like a rock station.  There's a little more tweaking going on, but we're getting there. 
[18:00]
 Yeah, it feels good.  The hallways around here feel good.  Yes, Andrew has given us rock tunes now.  This is great.  Feels like a.  Little revitalization going on.  Yeah.  Got to congratulate Joyce Messina of Staten Island, our latest kiss ticket winner,  give away kiss tickets all weekend long for you.  And your next chance to win is when you hear the Rolling Stones do Beast of Bird.  And when you hear that song be the 20th caller, we'll make it the 20th call this 
[18:30]
 time around. Right.  To one, two, seven, five, seven, one, two, seven.  You'll score the tickets.  Kiss coming in to visit us.  We'll have details on that in a few days or so.  OK. And Steven Tyler was on our show yesterday.  He promised.  And we got the tape that he promised he would come in.  Yes, he did. When they do that show, December 27th.  We got to get him in here.  He promised.  It's one thing talking on the phone.  It's one thing having him right in your face going, well, but did that. 
[19:00]
 They got a little bit.  We asked him to come in and he said, yes, we have it on tape.  And we'll play it over and over again.  I hope he's a man of his word.  So stay tuned for details on that as well.  Everyone is calling in on this lovely FU Friday for the Brady Bunch bit, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I don't even know if we could do it justice at this point.  Well, I got a little piece of the of the bit still saved here.  Well, we had my buddy Joe Plankfoot and Adam Ferrara. 
[19:30]
 World renowned comedian extraordinaire in the studio the other day.  And we started I don't know how we got off in this Brady Bunch thing.  But I had pointed out that Mr.  Brady, who designed the Brady House, built the stairway up into the kids' rooms  with no backs on the stairs.  I thought and I always did that.  He was probably under there looking up the girls skirts.  And that was the reason no backs, because he wanted to be underneath the stairs  when they go up and down the stairs.  Yes, to watch the dirty Brady girls come down in their dresses. 
[20:00]
 Look at you. You're you're a dirty girl, aren't you?  Have to call you for breakfast.  You'll be late for school, Cindy.  Yeah, let me look under that skirt.  We're not blood related.  No. And you're a dirty little girl.  Here I am.  Up on this.  Oh, we're on the air.  Still got that Metallica song in my head.  Stay.  Yeah, there I go.  Wow.  Turn the page. 
[20:30]
 Yeah, yeah.  We have turned the page today.  Metallica 1027 W.  Any W. The Rock of New York, Dave Matthews, man, don't drink the water.  We got to get him.  Into the any W.  Studios as well, we got we got this wish list.  OK, we want kids.  They're going to come up here.  We have details coming for you.  We want to have Steven Tyler up here.  We interviewed him yesterday.  He promised he would stop on by and say hi to us.  Right. When he comes into town, December 27th for that show. 
[21:00]
 Now we want to get Dave Matthews as well.  That would be cool, right?  We can do that.  Maybe get him in the imaginary ballroom.  You never know to play.  So be it, Anthony. It's a few Friday.  You're patiently waiting to win kiss tickets.  That's cool.  You got to listen for the Rolling Stones.  Be some burden when you hear that.  We're going to go for the 20th call this hour at two one two seven five seven one  oh two seven for the kiss tickets.  Yeah. Well, I got to say to everybody, thank God.  Traffic just rushing out of New York tonight.  There's no traffic now. 
[21:30]
 There's no traffic today because Mayor Giuliani is really cracking down  on blocking the box.  Of course, you know, he you're stuck when the lights green in the middle  of the intersection and it turns red.  You actually get a bulldozer comes, picks your car up and throws you in a dump truck.  The stormtroopers come in from the sky.  Yeah. To give you the ticket.  They rappel down and beat you with plunger handles.  Yeah. How many people did we see blocking the box today? 
[22:00]
 Oh, please. How many?  Seriously, every intersection, every single intersection.  So it has it gone into effect yet?  People don't know. Maybe you know what the problem is.  You're broadcasting it in English.  That's the problem. No one knows.  Hey, don't block the box. Huh?  What do you want the budget to be?  Block the box.  Doesn't it doesn't translate?  No. Also, double parking.  Now you got the whole road to drive on because no one's double parked out there right now.  If you're driving, you look, you won't see one double parked car or truck. 
[22:30]
 Nothing. Yeah, of course.  And no one's rubbernecking today, right, Anthony?  No, they know. Move along.  Yes, of course.  That never affects our ride home.  All right. It's FU Friday.  Keep the facts is coming if you're still working two one two nine five seven W.  Any W. FU Jay Killian for being a lying whore.  To remember what goes around comes around.  I like the ugly ones.  FU to all the owners who drive the new Volkswagen Beetle. 
[23:00]
 That's good. FU to all our ex-girlfriends.  FU to David Berkowitz.  Yeah, what's on the set?  He's got a new should have been son of a bitch.  Yeah. Yeah, the guy is he's found God.  He teaches Bible class.  They say he is just the perfect, perfect prisoner.  Oh, that's cute.  It's easy to be the perfect prisoner when you're locked up,  you don't have access to a gun and can't go out on the street.  This guy, I think, is full of crap. 
[23:30]
 I saw him on the news last night.  You see that big scar on his neck?  Yeah, they didn't finish the job.  And now, but if he found God, I'm going to lose God.  Yeah. If he has truly found God, there is a problem.  Something tells me if he's so into the Bible,  he should pretty much know there's no way out of it.  I mean, he's going to hell.  If he believes, yeah, that's now shall not kill.  I mean, you can do all the ass kissing you want now.  But I think I think you're going to burn.  No, Anthony, the Lord forgives everyone. 
[24:00]
 I don't know what the ground rules are there, Opie.  But I say if you're blasting young people's heads off,  it doesn't matter what you say after the fact.  I just get confused with my religion.  Yeah, I'm very confused because the pope like changes the rules every year.  Yeah. So let's say like it used to be a really bad sense to eat meat on Fridays.  So let's say, you know, a while ago, you ate meat on Friday.  So now you're in hell for eternity.  Yeah. And then like the pope decides now it's OK to eat meat on Friday. 
[24:30]
 Yeah. Well, what happens to the people that are like in hell for eating meat on Fridays?  They get a reprieve? I don't know what happened.  You can't because you're in there for eternity.  Someone please explain that to me, because the pope does change the rules all the time  and people go to hell left and right.  And then he makes these things OK again.  Have you ever done something that you just went, I am going to burn in hell for this?  No, I never think twice.  Nothing? No, no.  There's one thing that just keeps haunting me that I know I'm just going to burn for this.  What is going to burn for it? 
[25:00]
 I am coming up with me. Yeah, that.  Besides that, I I I actually had a had sex  in a broom closet at St.  Anthony of Padua Church in East Northport.  You had sex in a church in a church with the priest.  No, we with the with the priest.  Now you jackass.  What was his name?  You had said it was.  Hey, everyone, Anthony had sex with a priest in a church. 
[25:30]
 I mean, there's a priest, you idiot.  Oh, my God.  You had sex with a priest.  No, I didn't say that.  I said I did.  He had a little white color on with.  Oh, man.  Yeah, in a church closet.  And I just know I'm going to I'm going to burn for that one with a priest.  What do you think I am you in the confessional while the priest was?  Do believe me, you look a little better with the little altar boy uniform on 
[26:00]
 than I would you fit the bill a little more than I do.  Blondie, look at it.  Look, I'm getting I think you'd be the prize of the rectory, my friend.  Just because you did a priest in a church, don't take it out on me.  I love how you build these fantasies.  We spank it.  I listen to thinking of those fantasies.  I think the listeners heard you say that you had sex with a priest.  I think I think they heard me say that I had sex years ago with a woman 
[26:30]
 in a closet in a church.  I didn't hear a woman. I heard priest.  No, I hope he said priest.  That's why you heard priest.  You heard it in your own head.  I didn't hear that at all.  Thank you, Rick.  I didn't hear that at all.  Anthony, he's trying to know he's on my side.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, he's just trying to cover up something from his past.  Probably. Let's see.  The priest. No.  Where does the priest come in?  I never said that. OK.  I didn't even say what type of church it was.  All right. Well, give us the details, Anthony.  I don't want to give details.  I was just saying that was it. 
[27:00]
 Well, who is this lady?  I'm not going to say why, because that wasn't the point of the story.  We just casually have sex in a church with a lady.  Yeah. Who was it?  I'm not going to say.  Who was it?  If we were at a state, I would say, but I'm not going to say.  She's still in the state?  Of course.  One of your cousins?  No. Yeah.  My cousin, the priest.  Hey, Anthony had sex with one of his cousins in a church.  Cousin? Well, who retarded? 
[27:30]
 Was it like someone from Bible class or something?  Please.  It was your mom.  Oh, you got me.  Are we going to just do this moron ping pong back and forth like this?  All right.  I try to just bring something up.  All right.  You're sharing.  And you twist it around into something that never happened.  I guess I have bad hearing.  OK.  So bad hearing.  So you had sex with some lady in a church.  And it's just being raised a Roman Catholic. 
[28:00]
 It just was one of those things where it's like, me, I think that's going to stick on my permanent record.  But who was it?  How old were you?  We need to know a little bit more.  I guess I was 17.  And it was just a girl you.  Yeah, so I kind of gone out with the time.  And you snuck in the church, obviously.  Now, there was some kind of thing going on in the church, some kind of church thing.  Like a bizarre.  It was one of those like church bizarre things.  It wasn't mass.  No, no, it wasn't during a service or anything. 
[28:30]
 Yeah.  Feeling of my own Holy Communion.  Come on.  Just ask it.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  That's all.  They're having some church bizarre and you're in a closet somewhere.  Yeah, it was pretty pretty insane.  But you know how the Roman Catholic Church is very guilt ridden.  Yeah.  So, you know, I kind of felt bad about that.  Interesting.  Yeah.  But I don't anymore.  But at the time, what was going through your head as you're getting a little out of the closet?  Wow, this feels great.  What do you mean what was going through my head?  Well, you got the church, you got the bizarre going on. 
[29:00]
 I don't know.  Just kind of shut the door.  Like this is really cool.  Yeah.  As the act was over, then the guilt's like.  Yeah, then it was like, wow, maybe that was, you know, not a good thing to do.  Oh, yeah, that was kind of bad.  What?  Let's get out of here quick.  I joined a Satan cult at this point.  It's pretty much over.  Wow.  Were there any splatter marks, Ann?  Oh, what are you doing?  Why did I turn your light on?  What are you doing?  What do you think this is?  Oh, God, you people. 
[29:30]
 I try sharing a little moment and keep it as clean as possible.  Just say it happened.  And everyone wants details.  Well, you opened your big mouth.  So you think you're going to hell for that?  No, I know.  I'm not now.  Just at the time, it was kind of like, maybe I shouldn't have done that.  I don't care now.  You think I care?  I can chalk up 20,000 other things after that.  Just trying to probably get me a front row seat.  I'll sit between Hitler and Mussolini.  Oh, don't say anything. 
[30:00]
 Oh, man.  Come on.  Very good, Anthony.  Well, there you go.  Thank you, Opie.  Cute story.  He's not talking now.  Enough said.  Shut up.  Don't let me bring up the hairy broad.  You what?  Yeah, turn the mic off.  Go ahead.  I'm going to talk to the engineers at this radio station  and have them hook me up with my button.  I want a mic button.  Hello?  The engineers at WNEW, I want a mic button hooked up in front of me. 
[30:30]
 You've wrote the Virginia story enough.  All right, on the way.  Hope you had sex the first time with this girl.  How dare you hang down her back?  She looked like Chewbacca the Wookie.  Opie.  Little witty.  I love you.  Yes, she is quite a hairy bimbo, I'll do. 
[31:00]
 All right, for sharing.  Oh, wow, Anthony.  The phones are ringing.  Let's take one.  NEW.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah?  Yeah, when you were in the church with that priest,  were you pitching or catching?  Shut up!  You were pitching with the priest.  Come on, repent now.  Come on, you bitch.  Let it out.  Don't listen to Opie.  He turns the story around before I even get done. 
[31:30]
 It was a girl in a church closet.  No priest came into it.  I don't even know why I have to.  I'm putting this position.  I've got to explain.  I think the Lord forgives you.  He forgives and forgets.  Oh, shut up!  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, with Eve 6.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's FU Friday.  FU to the New York City Transit Police.  Go find a real criminal instead of $25 tickets  for drinking coffee in the morning or a beer  after work on the subway.  I know how to use a garbage can. 
[32:00]
 Ridiculous.  Oh, look, the phones are still ringing for you, Anthony.  NEW.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah?  My name is Bob.  I was wondering, do you have a date for church on Sunday?  Everyone's a smart ass.  Everyone's a smart ass.  Oh, no, come on.  Yeah, I'll be gentle, I promise.  There was no incident with a priest ever in my past.  OK? 
[32:30]
 For God's sake, Opie?  I got to go.  Father O'Malley's calling.  OK, yeah, you go.  Jericho.  Oh, cute.  Yeah, this is just the funniest show we've ever, ever had,  ever, ever.  Now, Anthony, the listeners heard you.  They heard me say I had sex with a woman in a closet in a church.  No.  Years and years and years ago.  No.  Because we were talking about burning in hell. 
[33:00]
 No, you're trying to cover it up now.  I mean, I asked the listeners if they heard what I heard.  And obviously, we've taken 10 calls, and they've all  heard the same thing I did.  No, because they all are just being so funny, like Opie.  When I say, yeah, I had sex in a church closet.  Oh, with a priest?  Oh, my God, with a priest.  I never said a priest.  Anthony, I got a song I want to play for you, for you and your little  priest friend.  There was no priest.  Oh, yeah, cute, cute. 
[33:30]
 Just great.  Just laugh your goddamn head off.  Be quiet.  I want to enjoy this.  Listen to the words.  It's a dog waiting for suggestions.  He's no nervous, avoiding all the questions.  You jackass.  His head's dry, but his heart is gently pounding.  Don't you just know exactly what we're thinking? 
[34:00]
 If you are my father, and you think I'm safe.  All right, you're just so funny.  Oh, Opie's funny.  He's finally got revenge for the hairy fat broad story.  Hey, hey, hey.  Just reach out and touch me.  Come on, tell me.  If I got to come around there and use that mic,  we're not going to be able to use it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[34:30]
 Funny.  I get it.  I get it, right.  All right.  So there's the scenario.  OK, yeah, I get it now.  Doesn't end, doesn't.  You're a dick.  This is Opie's little way of getting me back. 
[35:00]
 Turn my mic off, you...  I am going to curse just to end this.  Yeah, hope you're all enjoying your commute home.  Yeah, this is great.  It's just great, isn't it?  Opie strikes back.  OK, that's right.  Four months later, he's getting his vengeance and just basking in it.  All right, good.  Shut up. 
[35:30]
 I want to enjoy this.  All right.  All right.  I don't think it's funny anymore.  Good, good, good.  Choke.  That's it.  The power of the Lord is getting you.  Oh, man.  I don't know where you come up with this stuff.  I'm going to save this little song for you, Anthony.  So we can play it from time to time.  Let me put it over here in our little pile of wacky tunes. 
[36:00]
 You're a jackass, man.  OK.  Just remember that.  Harry back broad.  Opie had sex with.  Yeah, the listeners aren't going to believe you now.  Sorry.  Tides have turned today.  Hang in there, Anthony.  Sunday's only two days away.  Revel in it, Opie.  Just revel in it.  You can make it.  You know the next one that I pull out on you is just going to be worse.  It's going to be World War III.  It's going to get to the atomic weapons, verbal nuclear warfare, 
[36:30]
 and then it's going to get ugly.  It's an arms race now.  All right.  Yeah, on the way, we're going to play chocolate salty balls because a lot of people are requesting that.  The chef song from the South Park CD.  OK.  One oh two seven W.A.W.  The Rock of New York, the latest from the Black Crowes kicking my heart around.  New CD is going to be out in January.  Earl?  Yes.  You're the music man around here.  January.  We have our coffee though, and the CD is really, really good. 
[37:00]
 And the Rolling Stones before that.  Beast of Bird.  And that was the song you had to be listening for this hour to win the kiss tickets.  And Sandy Levine from Plainview, Long Island, won the ticket.  Sandy?  Yeah.  Are you psyched?  I'm psyched.  Cool.  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  All right, my guys.  We got you live in the air.  That's great.  Yes, so don't curse or anything.  We just wanted to congratulate you.  Thanks very much.  OK.  What are you doing this weekend?  Yeah, what are we doing this weekend? 
[37:30]
 We have a Las Vegas night at the temple.  Woohoo!  Believe it or not.  You guys are going to go see the Brad Pitt movie?  You know, actually we were talking about it for next weekend for the review and it was  really bummed.  Yeah, all the New York papers are killing it.  Half a star, one star.  And not only that, it got a sisterhood for three hours.  So I don't know about that.  That's pretty sad.  The Brad Pitt movie is getting horrible reviews.  Anthony's.  I think I could take him for three hours though.  I don't know. 
[38:00]
 That's why all you ladies are going to see the movie.  You better believe it.  You don't care that the movie blows.  You just want to stare at him for three hours.  I'm disappointed to tell you the truth.  Well, with all the commercials, I assume this was going to be an Academy Award winner.  I know the way of promoting it.  All right, well congratulations on the kiss tickets.  Thanks very much.  This is a lucky Friday the 13th.  All right.  Well, it's not too lucky to have you here today.  A great job.  For you it's lucky.  Yeah, it's lucky for me.  This Friday the 13th will go down in history. 
[38:30]
 Trust me.  Right.  You will soon know what I'm talking about.  All right.  Thanks, Annie.  Say hello to all my friends in Plainview.  I will.  All right.  Have a great weekend.  You too, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye now.  Yeah, and I know what you did last summer, blah, blah, the Bahamas.  Yeah.  We'll be with Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Horrible reviews too.  I don't care.  Horrible.  So you're going to go just to stare at her, right?  Yeah, like the girls go to see Brad Pitt.  I want to go and see Jennifer Love.  See, I just can't do that.  You see every ad in the paper for that movie and every ad on billboards, TV ads, trailers, 
[39:00]
 her boobs are prominently featured.  Yes, but...  If you look at anything.  But her actual boob size is not as big as the posters.  I noticed that in a few clips of the movie.  She's deceiving.  Sometimes she looks small.  They airbrushed those puppies, made them look a little bigger for you, Anthony.  She has great boobs.  I just don't get it with her.  Why?  I don't...  She's hot.  Yeah, she's hot, but I don't know, you lose your mind over her. 
[39:30]
 Look at her bod and everything.  I'd rather go with Drew Barrymore.  Come on.  You need a little bit of skank.  Just a taste of skank in there.  So, all right, different tastes, okay.  Yes, I guess, Anthony.  Who cares?  All right, hey, I got the telemarketer call from yesterday.  Yeah, we were getting a couple of those coming up on instant feedback. 
[40:00]
 We mentioned we were going to play it yesterday and we never did.  1027WNAW, the Rock of New York, Stone, Temple Pilots, Plush, Police Before That, and It's All Right for You.  It's open, Anthony, on FU Friday.  And I must say once again, the music sounds really, really good today.  Thank you, Andrea.  Working very soft down the hall because, you know, we did a lot of trashing last week, so we want to give credit where credit is due this week.  The music has sounded great.  Well, I don't think a lot of the people were responsible for what was going on. 
[40:30]
 A lot of the people here doing the music.  No, I understand that.  But I didn't want them to think that I was, you know, completely trashing them as well.  No, we just were speaking out on the evolution, the air pollution.  Move on.  At this hour, when you hear Paranoid by Black Sabbath, be the 10th caller to win a pair of tickets to the Sold Out Kiss Show at Madison Square Garden November 23rd.  We're doing that all weekend long for you.  And we're going to get the boys from Kiss to stop on by our show.  We'll have details soon.  And I got to say it again. 
[41:00]
 We had Steven Tyler on the phone yesterday and we asked him to come to the to the studio.  And he said yes.  He said, yes, he will come in.  And we're going to play the tape over and over again until he commits and does it for us.  He's freaking cool.  It's fun to have him.  And the third person on our dream wish list, I should say, is Dave Matthews.  Yeah.  And I want to make that happen, too.  I think that'd be really cool.  All right. Right.  It's FU Friday.  I was just checking the email.  Well, STP was playing. 
[41:30]
 This poor guy.  He blew it so bad.  You know, we got the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah.  OK, listen to this, Anthony.  I am a 40 year old auto repair shop general manager in Brooklyn and I have a small problem.  On Tuesday night, I got my fiance to give me a hummer.  That's good.  It wasn't a complete hummer.  But for a man who never gets one, it was better than nothing.  This occasion is rare.  So I consider this an accomplishment.  I mean, like walking on the moon.  My trouble is that I made the mistake of telling her I only did it to brag about getting a 
[42:00]
 Hummer on Hummer Tuesday.  What a schmuck.  I will now have a better chance of hitting a lottery than getting another Hummer.  Oh, man.  Gina will be driving home between four fifty and five listening to the show.  Whoops.  Oops.  Why do you send the email after five then, John?  You made another mistake.  I can't win.  Can you guys explain to her how important hummers are and that it's not demeaning to give one, 
[42:30]
 especially since her fiance me is willing to address her needs in total and for incredible  money.  So he told his fiance that he he just wanted her to do it so he could brag tall as buds  and stuff that he became a member of the Tuesday night Hummer Club.  That's stupid.  But then he has this run on sense that doesn't make any sense. 
[43:00]
 But anyway, look, a gift Hummer in the mouth.  Thank you for your help, John.  So she's listening.  Well, she was listening because you only listen to us for 10 minutes and then she pops on  that one oh three point five disco crap.  Oh, please.  That station plays one song for 20 straight hours, I think it's one song. 
[43:30]
 But I don't know what to tell Gina.  John, John, you blew it.  You just got to keep your mouth shut.  You don't do that.  Maybe he was just so excited with the fact that he finally got one guys brag all the  time, but you don't admit to your girlfriend that you brag.  Oh, I'll never learn.  I'll never learn.  I'll be we will be inducting new members this coming Tuesday night. 
[44:00]
 It's going to be a private his whole career in this little organization.  Never getting any more stripes.  Poor guy.  And we are working on some type of bumper sticker so you can put it on your car that  way you could brag without, you know, brag.  Maybe some like I'm humming because of opiate Anthony on W.A.W.  Got mine.  Got mine.  Did you get yours?  I don't know.  We'll figure something out.  We're going to help us with some type of slogan that we could put on a bumper sticker.  We definitely encourage you guys to help us develop this show. 
[44:30]
 So send it in to us.  A big FU to every long distance phone company that wants me to dial 1010 anything.  When I see their commercials, I can't get to the remote fast enough to change the channel.  I will never use their services.  Say Dennis Miller.  I don't know.  They've made it so confusing.  I don't know what to do now.  1010101234109872.  321-108.  I honestly, if I had to use the 1010 thing right now, I wouldn't know what to do because  they have completely confused the issue. 
[45:00]
 Whatever hip credibility Dennis Miller had with his talk show, you know, goofing on everybody  and how, yeah, this guy doesn't know anything about what a shill for this and that.  And all he's doing is shilling for that company.  He looks like a dork doing it.  He sold out.  That's it.  He sold out.  Comedians sell out.  Paul Reiser.  Oh, get him off TV.  He's just not funny.  George Carlin's doing one now.  George Carlin's doing one too?  Yeah, where he's like doing stand up on a stage and it's all about his 1010 whatever.  102894. 
[45:30]
 Whatever it is.  You know, when I pick up my phone, I just dial the number.  That's what I do.  I dial the number.  What's with the 1010?  And while we're on the subject of comedians, I wanted to bring this up earlier this week.  I didn't believe you about a month ago, but I was flipping by the FX channel and Bobcat  Goldthwait, who's never, ever, ever been funny in his entire career, never has.  But he's one of those lucky stiffs that, you know, they open the door for him in Hollywood 
[46:00]
 and they never kick you out.  I don't understand that logic.  Once you're in, you're in.  Forever.  Tom Arnold's part of that club and Bobcat Goldthwait.  There's just a ton of people that, you know.  The entire cast of the Police Academy.  Yes, Sinbad.  He had his chance.  Kick him out of Hollywood.  But no, they'll give him a million projects.  Sinbad, who now looks like G.I. Joe with the lifelike hair.  You see him on his show?  He's got the real thin, like the short cut hair.  He looks like G.I. Joe with the lifelike hair.  Does he have the kung fu grip?  Kung fu grip.  Hold the mic. 
[46:30]
 So I'm watching Bobcat Goldthwait's stupid TV show.  By the way, we blew him off because he wanted to be on our show.  And he's doing our bit.  Yeah.  He's doing our high mom bit.  I saw that and I was like, all right.  All right.  Well, let's just see where it's going.  Maybe it takes a different tack.  And it didn't.  It was the exact same thing.  Trust me, it's our bit.  Simple as that.  The girl call up her mother.  Yes.  And tell her that she was in a porno movie.  And they only give the girls 30 seconds, so there's never a chance for it to ever be funny. 
[47:00]
 Doesn't establish.  There's a whole wheel of things like high mom, I'm in porno.  High mom, I'm pregnant.  High mom, I'm getting married.  High mom, I'm in jail.  All these that we have done in the past, a bunch of them are on our Demented World CD.  And you can't find it in New York, but whatever.  But he's doing our bit.  And he's doing it badly.  I don't think that show will last.  So I wouldn't worry about it.  Bobcats.  Big asshole.  Yeah.  It was funny for about two minutes. 
[47:30]
 1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Scorpions rock you like a hurricane.  Kenny Wayne Shepard before that.  Blue on black.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  Talking about what's been going on around New York the last few days.  We almost forgot about Joe Tory, manager of the year.  Yay.  Earl's all excited over there.  He did a fine job.  The man deserves it.  They should throw him a ticket tape parade.  Screw John Glenn.  Give it to Tory. 
[48:00]
 He had his ticket tape parade with the Yankees.  True.  Did Georgie, Georgie, Georgie, Georgie Corky Steinbrenner have a comment?  Like he did after the Yankees won the series in the locker room all drunk or whatever he was.  With his crazy Eddie suit on.  I don't know.  He wears that all the time too.  Every time you see him he's got the turtleneck and the blazer on.  Crazy Georgie.  Did he say, Joe Tory's the best manager in baseball. 
[48:30]
 I just got sick.  I've known him for years.  Turn into Corky Steinbrenner.  Joe Tory.  Joe Tory, best manager in the baseball game.  He won the big baseball game for the Yankees.  He's the best baseball manager game.  My name is Corky Steinbrenner and he's the best Joe Tory. 
[49:00]
 In the bad baseball.  I'm on a con dog.  I'm on a con dog Joe Tory.  My name is Corky Steinbrenner.  I'm on a con dog.  You're a manager of the year.  You're the bestest in the baseball game.  Right? 
[49:30]
 That's right.  They call my name.  Georgie Steinbrenner is my name.  And we won the baseball game.  Because Joe Tory manager.  I'm on a con dog.  Give me the con dog.  Give me con dog.  I thought we retired that bit.  Corky Steinbrenner is my name.  And we won the bad baseball game.  Give me the con dog. 
[50:00]
 So congratulations to Joe Tory manager of the year.  Wish him well.  Wish him well of course.  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York, Cracker and Lowe.  Black Sabbath Paranoid that was the song you had to be listening for this hour to win the tickets to see Kiss.  And Eddie Krieger of Scotch Plains, New Jersey.  He was paying attention and he's got some tickets to the sold out show.  Congratulations, Eddie.  And thanks for listening.  We appreciate it.  Yes, we do. 
[50:30]
 The Kiss winning will continue with Matt Devotee.  He's down the hall.  He's making his way to the studio.  He'll be in here in just a few minutes.  I guess we're out of here.  We're done ski man.  Don't ski for another week.  Thanks for listening.  We really appreciate it.  Start in the weekend.  Yes.  Monday we'll be back.  Don't worry.  Don't fret people.  Yeah, we'll be back.  Why?  I'm not saying nothing.  No, I'm just saying that look the same at most people or at least some people out there like I wish you wouldn't come back. 
[51:00]
 We understand.  We do understand that.  But we're building our army.  We are building our army.  We know you're out there.  You know, we always talk about the negative side of this whole mess of rebuilding a station.  But we we do know that there's a lot of people catching on and doing what we're doing.  And there's a vibe man.  I want to thank you guys.  We know you're out there.  You tell us with your email and your faxes and your instant feedback and your phone calls.  So thank you.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  There's nothing else to say. 
[51:30]
 I guess play the music. </pre>
