<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a "FU Friday" segment.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, unleashed a barrage of "F.U.s" directed at various targets, including O.J. Simpson, Mayor Giuliani, Saddam Hussein, and a toll collector.  This was interspersed with discussions about the Fox TV show "When Good Pets Go Bad," showcasing animal attacks and workplace mishaps (one woman notably urinating on her boss's chair).  The "Hummer Club," a recurring topic, came under scrutiny from listeners who felt it unfairly burdened women with keeping relationships exciting.  Opie and Anthony defended the club, asserting it was for both sexes and promoted reciprocity.  Listener emails detailed marital infidelity and the inherent double standards regarding household chores and expectations.  Throughout the "FU Friday" segment, KISS concert tickets were given away.  The hosts also weighed in on the impending Iraq War, criticizing other news outlets for their excessive focus on the Monica Lewinsky scandal.  Red Peters, a friend of the show, was mentioned; his song was featured in a commercial for Babe's Auto Villa.  Further listener complaints about the Hummer Club, specifically women's reluctance to induct their men, fueled more discussion.  Additional listener "F.U.s" followed, targeting various individuals and groups. The hosts discussed David Berkowitz's conversion to Christianity in prison.  A lengthy, humorous exchange ensued where Anthony recounted a past sexual encounter in a church closet, provoking much playful banter and misinterpretations from Opie. The show continued to give away KISS tickets and promoted upcoming musical guests: KISS, Steven Tyler, and Dave Matthews. They commented favorably on their improved music selection.  The hosts also satirized Giuliani's stricter traffic enforcement.  The "FU Friday" concluded with more listener "F.U.s," discussions of movie reviews (films starring Brad Pitt and Jennifer Love Hewitt), comedians, and a reiteration of the Hummer Club concept and upcoming bumper sticker plans. A comedic George Steinbrenner impersonation ended the segment.

The broadcast concluded with a short segment acknowledging listener feedback, including negative reactions to their return to broadcasting. Opie and Anthony countered this negativity by highlighting their growing audience and expressing gratitude for their listeners' continued support via emails, faxes, and phone calls.  The show then ended without further comment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right, you want me to throw out the first F.U., Ann, or do you have one?  Go ahead, I'll punch up the instant feedback here.  All right, Opie and Anthony, big F.U. to O.J.  He wants people to leave him alone, then he should die.  He is guilty.  When his kids grow up, I hope they piss on his grave.  Wow.  Yeah, what a guy.  Reading in the paper that he's willing to share custody with Nicole's parents.  Yeah, that's cute.  Least he could do for, you know, butchering their daughter, I guess.  You know, what a guy.  He'll throw them a bone.  Throw them a bone, right.  It's unbelievable. 
[00:00:30]  Speaking of O.J., did you watch When Good Pets Go Bad last night?  I saw part of it.  I saw The Big Moose, funniest damn show on television.  That Fox, man, they have got something.  Every Thursday night now, they do this whole hour or two hours long of scariest police chases for,  and like an animal thing or a hidden video camera thing.  Next week, they're going to do People Caught on the Job,  and they show one girl taking a leak on her boss's big comfy chair in his office. 
[00:01:00]  She does this hidden camera, and she squats right down, pulls her pants down,  takes a leak on his chair.  That's great.  But when animals attack was hysterical.  The guy that put his head in the alligator's mouth is like one of these little Bill and Joe Bob farms down in Florida.  Sticks his head in an alligator's mouth, probably like he's done a hundred times.  Hundreds of times, sure.  And a drop of sweat hit the alligator's tongue and snapped his jaw shut on this guy's head. 
[00:01:30]  He's screaming and then rolling around in pain, and I'm laughing.  I'm just laughing at this guy.  It's great to laugh at that stuff.  It's funny.  The moose?  Yeah, the moose.  That's the one I saw.  Now, what was that deal?  Well, this moose was coming up to this, it was a part of the campus, this college campus.  I think it was Alaska or somewhere, I don't know, and it had a kid with it, a little baby moose,  and this guy kind of walked by, and the moose didn't have an escape route, so it attacked the guy. 
[00:02:00]  Just hooves up, bashing him on the head, kicking him, and then it goes away,  and the guy gets ready to get up, and it comes back, wham, wham, wham, wham, just hoofing him,  and I'm laughing hysterical.  Is it true they're going to do a show on people getting, you know, hit in the sack?  Hitting the sack?  Yeah, they are.  They're going to do, like, low, that's America's funniest videos, though.  They're doing some kind of low blow video.  Oh, we were ahead of our time, then.  We sure were.  We know.  We did a goof commercial on that on our Demented World CD.  The funniest outtakes are the ones where somebody's getting kicked in the groin. 
[00:02:30]  In the groiny.  Very good.  Very good.  Wow.  This faxes, ooh, this is tough.  Dear Opie and Anthony, I'm sending a big FU to you guys and all the male population  that has placed the responsibility of keeping a relationship hot on us, the women.  For example, your Tuesday night Hummer Club.  We also have to do the cooking and cleaning and shopping and raising the kids.  I'm positive that if we women had more help with household chores, there would be more energy for Hummers. 
[00:03:00]  So F you guys.  The girls don't understand something.  The club is for both sexes.  Yeah.  And we've encouraged the guys to reciprocate.  Of course, but it's got to start somewhere.  So we draw the starting line at the Hummers.  Yeah.  And you know, guys, ladies, I'm sorry.  We can move it into an apartment, put towels over the windows, and we have window treatments.  We're fine.  You know, it's not up to us.  I don't know.  Yeah.  We get the Jets glasses. 
[00:03:30]  We're just happy if we get a whole set.  That's jelly jars.  Yeah.  Jelly jars.  That's all we need.  I still have a Yogi Bear jelly jar that I use.  Drink iced tea out of.  You know, that's just the way we are.  And you're happy that way, right?  Yeah.  That's why we are never, the girls get mad at us all the time because we don't do things  around the house.  But we never get mad at the girls for not doing anything around the house because we  don't expect anything to get done.  Like I said, I get home, I don't notice if the wife has done the laundry.  And I don't go, oh, didn't do the laundry today, did you? 
[00:04:00]  You know, because I wouldn't even notice.  I don't even notice that.  No, you would just dig through the dirty laundry to find something that was almost clean.  So maybe that day she didn't want to do laundry and she put it off till tomorrow.  That's her prerogative because I won't jump on her for not doing the laundry.  But if she says to me, hey, take the garbage out and then I forget or don't feel like doing  it now, I'll do it tomorrow, whatever, I get jumped on.  Why didn't you do it?  I asked you to, it's like, geez, I don't ask you to do anything.  I appreciate the fact you do, but I'm not putting you on a schedule. 
[00:04:30]  No.  Well, lovely.  The never ending battle of spouses.  Wow, the phones are ringing like crazy.  We'll go to those next.  FU Friday continues with Opie and Anthony.  Here's one.  This one's brutal, Anthony.  I want to send a big FU to my wife.  Yes, dear, I have been and will continue to sleep with the friends of yours we met through  our son's school.  That's why I don't do you anymore.  I almost forgot what great sex is all about.  The show.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, KISS, Psycho Circus. 
[00:05:00]  And we have our KISS winner this hour.  The hour, excuse me, I'm eating crackers and I got, oh, you can't eat crackers on the air.  You breathe in and you get that cracker dust.  It goes right down your throat.  Oh, it's brutal.  But we got to congratulate John Seminaro of Corona, New York.  He's got a pair of tickets to see KISS.  Congratulations, John.  We're doing that all weekend long for you.  Matter of fact, I'll give you a little heads up here.  Next time you hear Jimi Hendrix doing manic depression, which is going to happen within  the hour, if you're the 10th caller at 212-757-1027, you will score tickets to the sold-out KISS 
[00:05:30]  show as well.  Okay?  All right.  It's FU Friday.  The facts is spilling in like crazy here.  If you're going to send one, please get right to the point because the long-winded ones,  we're not even reading because they're just piling up today.  We have to move on with this.  So, the facts line is 212-957-WNEW.  Opie and Anthony, a big FU to a world where franchise players such as Bernie Williams are  traded from a world champion to an expansion team so he can make $20 million instead of  $15 million. 
[00:06:00]  FU George, FU Baseball, FU Bernie, FU Sports Agents.  Wow.  Look at that.  A little ticked off there.  Well, Anthony in Staten Island, FU to New York City for stopping traffic again for John  Glenn.  Oh, bravo.  Enough with the ticket tape parades already.  Have we done it enough?  And the money that we're wasting on this, too.  Money, inconvenience, people work in this town, okay?  There was an article in the paper today that the subways need to be updated.  Yeah.  All right, take the money from the ticket, you know, tape parade you're going to throw 
[00:06:30]  Monday.  Screw the parade and throw it into the subway systems.  That'll help a little bit.  I know it won't take care of the problem, but at least it's going for a positive thing.  Enough.  Enough.  He got his ticker tape parade years ago.  I don't even like the ticker tape parades for the baseball teams or anything.  Oh, that's kind of exciting.  I don't know.  You know something?  Because I think that should be totally reserved and special just for, you know, hey, here comes  the guy that cured cancer.  You know, throw him a ticker tape parade. 
[00:07:00]  You're killing me.  I have to disagree.  Why?  If you're going to block up traffic and throw a bunch of paper out and waste millions of  bucks, let it be for something good.  You don't think it's exciting when the Yankees are tooling down the street?  Read that F you.  What?  The last one you just read.  True.  Who cares at this point?  They're all playing for laundry.  Oh, you're killing me.  They're playing for a uniform.  All of a sudden, it's just like different bodies in the uniform.  It's not like the old days.  Our listeners are going to hate us now.  They're not going to hate us. 
[00:07:30]  I'm just saying, reserve the ticker tape parades.  It's for, you know, the first people on the moon.  That was great.  Neil Armstrong.  But wait, wait, wait.  When your home team wins it, you got to do something.  You got to do something.  And that's what we do.  That's fine.  But to give John Glenn another one, who cares?  You're right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think ticker tape parades should be reserved for stuff that's like really huge.  It's kind of the point where, you know, they'll throw for anything.  No, they didn't give it to Sammy.  Sammy. 
[00:08:00]  Sammy Sosa didn't get his, now did he?  F you to Saddam Hussein.  We'll get that right the hell out of the way.  See you in hell.  Very good.  He's bending a little.  He's backing down just a tad.  Just like we said the other day.  Saying he's open to certain negotiations.  We're at the point where we're saying no negotiations.  You either do this or you get bombed.  And he's like, well, if it's fair and just negotiations to this, blah, blah, blah, then I'm willing to.  And we're like, no. 
[00:08:30]  We're going and bombing.  Yeah.  Well, speaking of that, we broke the news the other day.  This is a very interesting email.  Guys, I got to say, I heard you talking about the Iraq crisis and I had to know more.  I have a friend who is a flight engineer and will undoubtedly be there if there's a conflict.  I turned to other news stations.  And do you know what I heard?  What will Clinton do now with Monica?  So I got home, turned on CNN.  Will the impeachment proceedings be postponed?  What the F?  We may go to war and friends of mine may die and we're stuck on Monica. 
[00:09:00]  Who gives a S?  You guys were the only ones who put the imminent possibility of war before the private life of the press.  Well, that didn't really.  All right.  First, I got to say thanks for caring.  Then I have to wonder what's wrong with the rest of the media.  For all the hype and bull ass you guys get, you're the only ones who reported the news.  Keep up the good work, Dave.  Look at that.  Your newsletter, Opium Anthem.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  It's Opium Anthony on FU Friday.  Judas Priest, you've got another thing coming. 
[00:09:30]  Van Halen Unchained and Pearl Jam alive.  The music sounds great today.  Yeah, we're rocking.  Got to thank Andrea down the hallway.  She's taking care of us.  Yeah.  We love playing this.  Feels like rock.  It certainly does.  Smells like rock.  Tastes like rock.  We're enjoying it.  Keep it a coming, Andrea.  Keep it a coming.  All right.  How about an FU?  Yeah, go ahead.  Once again, I think this guy gets an FU every week. 
[00:10:00]  Mayor Giuliani.  Now he's starting his underground war.  Clean team cops to crack down on subway litter bugs.  And a bunch of fines you could get if you're drinking coffee on the subway.  An open container of coffee.  We need our coffee in the morning.  But we need to drink it on the subway.  Pummel in on that.  For God's sake.  What are you doing? 
[00:10:30]  You're going to spill coffee.  And I'm looking at the fines.  Carry an open container of liquid, such as coffee, in a moving vehicle.  I guess that's the bus or train.  25 bucks.  Come on.  Littering, dumping garbage, or spilling coffee, soda, or other beverage.  So if you just even spill it, 50 bucks.  Creating unsanitary conditions, such as spitting or urinating, 50 bucks.  Wait a minute.  Back up.  Yeah.  It's the same fine.  Same fine if you spill coffee or soda as it is if you whip it out and take a whiz on the subway. 
[00:11:00]  50 bucks.  I think the whizzing fine should be a little higher.  Just a little.  I don't think spilling a coffee, soda, or another beverage makes the subway smell.  Yeah.  I don't mind smelling the coffee on the subway.  I don't either.  I don't mind that at all.  When you're down there waiting to get on the subway, you're in a corner somewhere, and you smell a little coffee, it's okay.  It's okay.  It's like, wait, is that a grape soda? 
[00:11:30]  Eh, it's not that bad.  It's kind of pleasant while I wait.  But we all know that other smell, don't we?  Yeah, we do.  That's urine.  If you're caught, you know, taking a leak in public, there should be public hangings.  Ugh.  Public hangings.  Disgusting.  All right.  We got an FU coming through the email.  Lots of email coming in today.  Hey, guys.  I'm a toll collector for the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 10.  I listen to WNEW all day.  In fact, my radio broke on Wednesday, and I was very upset that I couldn't listen to your show. 
[00:12:00]  Well, today, I am in the busiest lane at this exit, and I want you to tell all your listeners that are driving on the turnpike and plan to get off at Exit 10 and come through my lane, lane number nine, FU.  I don't want their effing crinkle dollar bills.  I don't want their effing pennies.  I certainly don't want to give them any directions.  And no, they can't make a U-turn.  I want to go home just as bad as they do.  So have your effing money ready, and don't talk to me.  I want today to be as quick and painless as possible. 
[00:12:30]  I've been dealing with these people all week.  You think they know how much they have to pay by the time Friday comes.  Oh, my God.  You know that's true.  You get behind these people, and you see them.  They pull up to the booth, and then you see them unbuckle their belt.  They're sitting up in the seat, digging in their pocket.  They're all surprised that they've got to pay the toll at that moment in time.  Like, oh, I didn't know there was a toll here.  Yeah, you've only been in a traffic jam for 30 minutes.  Get it all together.  I hate that.  God.  It's the end of a long, long week, and I need a drink. 
[00:13:00]  Thanks, guys.  You rock.  Toll collector Jessica.  P.S.  I joined the Hummer Club on Tuesday and was well reciprocated.  Very good, Jessica.  All right.  You know, we had a little brainstorming meeting today,  and we're trying to get some type of bumper sticker or a pin  that we could give all our members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club for joining, yes.  And we will be inducting new members this coming Tuesday,  so keep listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Maria writes,  F you to any woman who did not induct her man into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  and had some lame excuse or a nasty attitude about it. 
[00:13:30]  I like that attitude, Maria.  Thank you.  Keep the FUs coming through the fax line.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  That's our pal, Red Peters.  How's your hole off his CD?  I laughed.  I cried.  I fudged my undies.  A good friend of the show, actually.  Yeah.  I've known him for a very long time, and he's now have,  I think he officially has the theme song for our Tuesday Night Hummer Club, too,  off his CD.  Oh, uh, Blobby.  Yeah, that's off this little ditty as well.  Of course. 
[00:14:00]  Great, great little ditty.  And he's on our record label, Restaurant Records.  Oh.  Don't even talk about it.  Who cares?  We can't even sell CDs because they're not in the stores.  We've gone through this before.  Well, I got news, good news, Anthony.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, well, last week we sold one Demented World CD.  Yeah.  In Manhattan.  Yes.  This week, guess how many we sold?  How many?  Up to seven, baby. 
[00:14:30]  Woo!  Yeah.  We're rocking now.  This rate will be 10 in no time.  They don't put them in the stores.  I don't even want to get into it.  No.  Don't even want to get into it.  You know, Red Peters donated a track to our CD.  Yeah, he did.  I got to play this.  Oh, which one is that?  Oh, the commercial, yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Because it's good for FU Friday, too.  Our pal Red Peters, who does How Is Your Whole Family, he donated a little track for our Demented World CD. 
[00:15:00]  Hold on here.  Check this out really fast.  Bad credit?  No credit?  No job?  No down payment?  Get the f*** out!  You want a great selection on a new or used car truck or minivan?  Get the f*** out!  You want friendly service?  Service with a smile?  Get the f*** out!  That's right.  Get the f*** out!  The Babe's Auto Villa.  Route 9, Chelsea.  Hey, I'd like a new minivan, but I have dick for credit. 
[00:15:30]  Get the f*** out!  When I buy a new car, I expect good service.  Get the f*** out!  Come to Babe's Auto Villa.  Route 9, Chelsea.  Hey, did you hear what I said?  Get the f*** out!  There is our pal Red Peters on our Demented World CD.  It is FU Friday.  FU to Opie and Anthony.  What?  What did we do now?  Hey, how come us girls never get special days for Hummers?  We would appreciate it just as much as you guys do. 
[00:16:00]  In my experience, if I do it first, the favor almost never gets returned.  Ooh, you know, that's a tricky one with some guys, yeah.  What's up with that?  And how come most of you guys want to know how we got so good at it?  Yeah, it's great when you're just, like, dating, like, at the beginning.  Yeah.  Then after a while, it's like, hey, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Where'd you learn that?  Yeah, you get a little jealous.  How about if you set aside a special day just for us?  Love you guys.  Anthony, can you explain the Tuesday Night Hummer Club? 
[00:16:30]  Because the ladies are feeling left out.  It's a way to break the ice.  We're talking about people that have been in relationships for a while.  It's hard for them to communicate.  They get busy.  They get caught up in jobs and home life for kids, whatever.  And it's hard for a guy, after so long it's gone by without it, to go, honey, honey, I can really use a Hummer.  So we're just asking for them.  Yes.  And it's not just supposed to be a, hey, thanks, you know, let me go call my pals on the phone. 
[00:17:00]  The guys are supposed to reciprocate.  Of course.  And do whatever their lady likes, actually.  It's just a way to break the ice.  That's all.  And the ladies officially become members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club as well.  And the ladies have been calling saying, I'm an official member.  Very proud.  See, we're giving you ladies the whole control of our club here.  Don't you understand?  Yeah.  Guys aren't willing to give ladies, you know, control of their club, but Anthony and I will do that here.  Of course.  It's all yours.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:17:30]  The Rock of New York Metallica.  Yeah.  Turn the page.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I hope you've noticed that the music has changed this week.  A little bit.  We've made a drastic turn for the better this week.  I hope you're realizing that.  Yeah.  A little, uh, we're rocking.  We are rocking.  It feels like a rock station.  That's what I'd say.  I must say it feels like a rock station.  Absolutely.  There's going to be a little more tweaking going on, but we're getting there. 
[00:18:00]  Yep.  It feels good.  The hallways around here feel good.  Yes.  Andrea's giving us rock tunes now.  This is great.  Feels like a little revitalization.  Going on.  Yeah.  Ah.  Ooh.  Ah.  Got to congratulate Joyce Messina of Staten Island, our latest Kiss ticket winner.  Giving away Kiss tickets all weekend long for you.  And your next chance to win is when you hear the Rolling Stones do Beast of Bird.  And when you hear that song, be the 20th caller. 
[00:18:30]  We'll make it the 20th caller this time around, all right, Rick?  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, and you'll score the tickets.  Kiss coming in to visit us.  We'll have details on that in a few days or so, okay?  Yeah.  And Steven Tyler was on our show yesterday.  He promised.  And we got the tape that he promised he would come in.  Yes, he did.  When they do that show December 27th.  Yeah, we got to get him in here.  He promised.  That's it.  It's one thing talking on the phone.  It's one thing having him right in your face going, 
[00:19:00]  We asked him to come in, and he said yes.  We have it on tape.  And we'll play it over and over again.  And I hope he's a man of his word.  Yeah.  So stay tuned for details on that as well.  Everyone is calling in on this lovely FU Friday for the Brady Bunch bit, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I don't even know if we could do it justice at this point.  I got a little piece of the bit still saved here.  Well, we had my buddy Joe Plankfoot and Adam Ferrara, world-renowned comedian, extraordinaire, in the studio the other day. 
[00:19:30]  And we started, I don't know how we got off on this Brady Bunch thing,  but I had pointed out that Mr. Brady, who designed the Brady House, built the stairway up into the kids' rooms with no backs on the stairs.  But I thought, and I always did, that he was probably under there looking up the girls' skirts.  And that was the reason no backs, because he wanted to be underneath the stairs when they go up and down the stairs.  Yes, to watch the dirty Brady girls come down in their dresses. 
[00:20:00]  Look at you.  You're a dirty girl, aren't you?  I have to call you for breakfast.  You'll be late for school, Cindy.  Yeah, let me look under that skirt.  We're not blood-related.  No.  And you're a dirty little girl.  Here I am, upon his...  Oh, we're on the air.  Still got that Metallica song in my head.  Stage.  Stage.  There I go.  Turn the page. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  We have turned the page today, yes.  Metallica.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York.  Dave Matthews Band, Don't Drink the Water.  We got to get him into the NEW studios as well.  Yeah.  We got this wish list.  Okay.  We want Kiss.  They're going to come up here.  We have details coming for you.  We want to have Steven Tyler up here.  We interviewed him yesterday.  He promised he would stop on by and say hi to us.  Right.  When he comes into town December 27 for that show. 
[00:21:00]  Now we want to get Dave Matthews as well.  Mm-hmm.  That would be cool, right?  We could do that.  Maybe get him in the imaginary ballroom.  You never know.  To play, yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's FU Friday.  You're patiently waiting to win Kiss tickets.  That's cool.  You got to listen for the Rolling Stones' Beast of Bird.  And when you hear that, we're going to go for the 20th call of this hour at 212-757-1027 for the Kiss tickets.  Yeah.  Well, I got to say to everybody, thank God, traffic just rushing out of New York tonight.  There's no traffic. 
[00:21:30]  No.  Well, there's no traffic today.  Because Mayor Giuliani is really cracking down on blocking the box.  Of course, you know, you're stuck when the light's green in the middle of the intersection and then it turns red.  You actually get a bulldozer comes, picks your car up and throws you in a dump truck.  The stormtroopers come in from the sky.  Yeah.  To give you the ticket.  They rappel down and beat you with plunger handles.  Yeah.  How many people did we see blocking the box today? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, please.  How many?  Seriously.  Every intersection.  Every single intersection.  So has it gone into effect yet?  People don't know.  Maybe you know what the problem is?  You're broadcasting it in English.  That's the problem.  No one knows.  Hey, don't block the box.  Huh?  Where the gunda bar you to go be?  Block the box.  It doesn't translate.  No.  Also, double parking.  Now you got the whole road to drive on because no one's double parked out there right now.  If you're driving, you look, you won't see one double parked car, I bet. 
[00:22:30]  Or truck.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Of course.  And no one's rubbernecking today, right, Anthony?  No.  They know.  Move along.  Yes.  Of course.  That never affects our right home.  All right.  It's FU Friday.  Keep the faxes coming if you're still working.  212-957-WNEW.  FU Jay Killian for being a lying whore.  And remember, what goes around comes around.  I like the ugly ones.  FU to all the owners who drive the new Volkswagen Beetle. 
[00:23:00]  That's good.  FU to all our ex-girlfriends.  FU to David Berkowitz.  Yeah.  What's up with that?  Son of Sam.  He's got a new...  Should have been son of a bitch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy, he's found God.  He teaches Bible class.  They say he is just the perfect, perfect prisoner.  Oh, that's cute.  Yeah.  It's easy to be the perfect prisoner when you're locked up.  You don't have access to a gun and can't go out on the street.  This guy, I think, is full of crap. 
[00:23:30]  I saw him on the news last night.  You see that big scar on his neck?  Yeah.  Yeah, they didn't finish the job, unfortunately.  Bastards.  But if he found God, I'm going to lose God.  Yeah.  If he has truly found God, there is a problem.  Something tells me, if he's so into the Bible, he should pretty much know there's no way out of it.  I mean, he's going to hell.  Thou shalt not kill.  If he believes, yeah, that's...  Thou shalt not kill.  I mean, you can do all the ass-kissing you want now, but I think you're going to burn.  No, Anthony.  The Lord forgives everyone. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know what the ground rules are there, Opie, but I say if you're blasting young people's heads off,  it doesn't matter what you say after the fact.  I just get confused with my religion.  Yeah, I'm very confused.  Because the Pope, like, changes the rules every year.  Yeah.  So, let's say, like, it used to be a really bad sin to eat meat on Fridays.  Mm-hmm.  So, let's say, you know, a while ago you ate meat on Fridays, so now you're in hell for eternity.  Yeah.  And then, like, the Pope decides now it's okay to eat meat on Friday. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Well, what happens to the people that are, like, in hell for eating meat on Fridays?  They get a reprieve?  I don't know.  What happens?  You can't, because you're in there for eternity.  Someone please explain that to me, because the Pope does change the rules all the time,  and people are going to hell left and right, and then he makes these things okay again.  Have you ever done something that you just went, I am going to burn in hell for this?  No, I never think twice.  Nothing?  No.  Nope.  There's one thing that just keeps haunting me that I know I'm just going to burn for this. 
[00:25:00]  What is it?  I'm going to burn for it.  I...  Teaming up with me?  Yeah, that.  Besides that, I actually had sex in a broom closet at St. Anthony of Padua Church in East  Northport.  You had sex in a church?  In a church.  With a priest?  No.  With a priest?  No, you jackass.  What was his name?  You had...  Anthony...  It wasn't...  Hey, everyone, Anthony had sex with a priest in a church. 
[00:25:30]  I didn't...  That's the word.  Anthony was a priest, you idiot.  Oh, my God.  You had sex with a priest?  No, I didn't say that.  I said I had sex...  Did he have his little white collar on?  With a woman in a church closet.  And I just know I'm going to burn for that one.  With a priest?  What do you think I am, you?  In the confessional?  While the priest was...  Dude, believe me, you'd look a little better with the little altar boy uniform on than I 
[00:26:00]  would.  You fit the bill a little more than I do, blondie.  Look at it.  All right?  Look at it.  I'm getting full thought.  I think you'd be the prize of the rectory, my friend.  Just because you did a priest in a church, don't take it out on me.  A priest?  I love how you build these fantasies.  What?  You spank it, thinking of those fantasies?  I think the listeners heard you say that you had sex with a priest in a church.  No, I think they heard me say that I had sex years ago with a woman in a closet in 
[00:26:30]  a church.  I didn't hear woman.  I heard priest.  No, Opie said priest.  That's why you heard priest.  You scared it in your own head, Rick.  No, I didn't hear that at all.  Thank you, Rick.  I didn't hear that at all, Anthony.  Opie's trying to...  No, he's on my side.  Oh, shut up.  Opie's just trying to cover up something from his past, probably.  Let's see.  The priest?  No.  Where does a priest come in?  I never said that.  Okay.  I didn't even say what type of church it was.  All right.  Well, give us the details, Anthony.  I don't want to give details.  I was just saying that was it. 
[00:27:00]  Well, who was this lady?  I'm not going to say.  Why?  Because that wasn't the point of the story.  You just casually have sex in a church with a lady.  Yeah.  Who was it?  I'm not going to say.  Who was it?  If we were out of state, I would say, but I'm not going to say.  She's still in the state?  Of course.  One of your cousins?  No.  Yeah, my cousin, the priest.  Hey, Anthony had sex with one of his cousins at a church.  Cousin?  Well, who retarded? 
[00:27:30]  Was it like someone from Bible class or something?  Please.  All right.  It was your mom, Opie.  Oh, you got me.  Well, are we going to just do this moron ping pong back and forth like this?  All right.  I try to just bring something up.  All right.  You're sharing.  And you twist it around into something that never happened.  I guess I have bad hearing.  Okay, so.  Bad hearing.  So you had sex with some lady in a church.  Yeah.  And it's just being raised a Roman Catholic, it just was one of those things where it was 
[00:28:00]  like, me, I think, you know, that's going to stick on my permanent record.  But who was it?  How old were you?  We need to know a little bit more.  I don't know.  I guess I was 17.  18.  And it was just a girl you.  Yeah.  It was kind of going out with at the time.  And you snuck in the church, obviously.  No, there was some kind of thing going on in the church, some kind of church thing.  No, come on.  Like a bazaar.  It was one of those church bazaar things.  It wasn't mass.  No.  No.  It wasn't during a service or anything.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Dealing up my own holy communion.  Come on.  I'm just asking.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  That's all.  They're having some church bazaar and you're in a closet somewhere.  Yeah.  It was pretty insane.  But you know how the Roman Catholic Church is.  Very guilt ridden.  Yeah.  So, you know, I kind of felt bad about that.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't anymore.  But at the time, what was going through your head as you're getting a little closet?  Wow.  This feels great.  What do you mean what was going through my head?  Well, you got the church. 
[00:29:00]  You got the bazaar going on.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And just kind of shut the door.  Like, this is really cool.  Yeah.  And as soon as the act was over, then the guilt's like.  Yeah.  Then it was like, wow, maybe that was, you know, not a good thing to do.  Oh.  Yeah.  That was kind of bad.  Wow.  Let's get out of here quick.  Join a Satan cult at this point.  It's pretty much over.  Wow.  Were there any splatter marks in?  Oh.  What are you doing?  Why did I turn your mic on?  What are you doing?  What do you think this is?  Oh, God, you people. 
[00:29:30]  I try sharing a little moment and keep it as, you know, clean as possible.  All right.  Just say it happened.  And everyone wants details.  Well, you opened your big mouth.  So you think you're going to hell for that?  No, I know I'm not now.  I just, at the time, it was kind of like, maybe I shouldn't have done that.  I don't care now.  You think I care?  I can chalk off 20,000 other things after that.  You're trying to probably get me a front row seat.  I'll see between Hitler and Mussolini.  Oh, don't say. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, man.  Come on.  Very good, Anthony.  Well, there you go.  Thank you, Opie.  Cute story.  He's not talking now.  Enough said.  Shut up.  Don't let me bring up the hairy broad.  Turn the mic off.  Go ahead.  I'm going to talk to the engineers at this radio station and have them hook me up a mic button.  I want a mic button.  Hello?  The engineers at WNEW? 
[00:30:30]  I want a mic button hooked up in front of me.  You've rode the virginity story enough.  Opie.  All right.  On the way.  Opie.  Opie had sex the first time with this girl.  I had a hairy mane down her back.  She looked like Chewbacca the Wookiee.  Opie.  Cattle with me.  I love you.  Yes, she is quite a hairy bimbo, Opie. 
[00:31:00]  Love me.  All right.  For sharing.  Oh, wow, Anthony.  The phones are ringing.  Yeah.  Let's take one.  Any W.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you were in the church with that priest, were you pitching or catching?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Come on.  Come on.  Repent now.  Ah, you're pitching.  Let it out.  Don't listen to Opie.  He turns the story around before I even get done. 
[00:31:30]  It was a girl in a church closet.  No priest came into it.  I don't even know why I'm putting this position.  Now I've got to explain.  I think the Lord forgives you.  He forgives and forgets.  Oh, shut up.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, with Eve 6.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's F.U. Friday.  F.U. to the New York City Transit Police.  Go find a real criminal instead of $25 tickets for drinking coffee in the morning or a beer  after work on the subway.  I know how to use a garbage can. 
[00:32:00]  Ridiculous.  Oh, look.  The phones are still ringing for you, Anthony.  Any W.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  My name is Bob.  I was wondering, do you have a date for church on Sunday?  Everyone's a smartass.  Everyone's a smartass.  No, no.  Come on.  Yeah, I'll be gentle.  I promise.  There was no incident with a priest ever in my past.  Okay? 
[00:32:30]  Okay.  For God's sake.  Opie.  I got to go.  Father O'Malley's calling me.  Okay.  Yeah, you go.  Jericho.  Oh, cute.  Yeah.  This is just the funniest show we've ever, ever had.  Ever, ever.  Now, Anthony, the listeners heard you.  They heard me say I had sex with a woman in a closet in a church.  No.  Years and years and years ago.  No.  Because we were talking about burning in hell. 
[00:33:00]  No.  No.  You're trying to cover it up now.  I mean, I asked the listeners if they heard what I heard, and obviously, we've taken ten  calls, and they've all heard the same thing I did.  No, because they all are just being so funny, like Opie, when I say, yeah, I had sex in  a church closet.  Oh, with a priest?  Oh, my God, with a priest.  I never said a priest.  Hey, Anthony, I got a song I want to play for you.  For you and your little priest friend.  I, there was no priest?  Oh, yeah, cute, cute.  Just great. 
[00:33:30]  Just lop your goddamn head off.  Be quiet.  I want to enjoy this.  Listen to the words.  It's the Lord waiting for suggestions.  He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions.  Shut up, you jackass.  All right, yeah, you're just so funny. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, he's finally got revenge for the hairy fat broad story.  Hey, hey, hey.  Just reach out and touch me.  Come on, honey.  If I got to come around there and use that mic, you're not going to be able to use it. 
[00:34:30]  Funny.  I get it.  I get it.  Right.  All right.  So there's the scenario.  Okay, yeah, I get it now.  Doesn't end, doesn't.  Come on, honey.  Let's spend the night today.  You're a dick.  Now hold on a minute before we go.  This is Opie's little way of getting me back.  Give me a dime so I can call. 
[00:35:00]  Turn my mic off, you.  I am going to curse just to end this.  Give me a dime.  And you think I'm sexy.  Yeah.  Hope you're all enjoying your commute home.  Yeah, this is great.  It's just great, isn't it?  If you really need me.  Hope he strikes back.  Okay.  All right.  Four months later, he's getting his vengeance and just basking in it.  All right.  Good. 
[00:35:30]  Shut up.  I want to enjoy this.  Oh.  All right.  I don't think it's funny anymore.  Good, good, good.  Choke.  That's it.  The power of the Lord is getting you.  Oh, man.  I don't know where you come up with this stuff.  I'm going to save this little song for you, Anthony, so we can play it from time to time.  Let me put it over here in our little pile of wacky tunes. 
[00:36:00]  You're a jackass, man.  Okay.  Just remember that.  Hairy back broad.  Hope he had sex with.  Yeah.  The listeners aren't going to believe you now.  Sorry.  Tides have turned today.  Hang in there, Anthony.  Sunday's only two days away.  Revel in it, Opie.  Just revel in it.  You can make it.  You know the next one that I pull out on you is just going to be worse.  It's going to be World War III.  It's going to get to the atomic weapons, verbal nuclear warfare, and then it's going to get ugly. 
[00:36:30]  It's an arms race now.  All right.  Yeah, on the way, we're going to play Chocolate Salty Balls because a lot of people are requesting that.  The chef's arm from the South Park CD.  Okay.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, the latest from the Black Crows, kicking my heart around.  New CD's going to be out in January.  Earl?  Yes.  You're the music man around here.  January.  We have our coffee, though. 
[00:37:00]  And the CD is really, really good.  And the Rolling Stones before that.  Beast of Bird.  And that was the song you had to be listening for this hour to win the Kiss tickets.  And Sandy Levine from Plainview, Long Island, won the tickets.  Sandy?  Yeah.  Are you psyched?  I'm psyched.  Cool.  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  My guys.  We got you live on the air.  That's great.  Yes, so don't curse or anything.  We just wanted to congratulate you.  Thanks very much.  Okay.  What are you doing this weekend?  Anything?  Yeah.  What are we doing this weekend? 
[00:37:30]  We have a Las Vegas night at the temple.  Woo-hoo!  Believe it or not.  You guys aren't going to go see the Brad Pitt movie?  You know, actually, we were talking about it for next weekend.  We saw the review, and it was really bummed.  Yeah, all the New York papers are killing it.  Half a star, one star.  And not only that, you've got to sit through it for three hours?  Oof.  Chicks.  So I don't know about that.  It's pretty sad.  The Brad Pitt movie is getting horrible reviews, and Anthony's...  I think I could take him for three hours, though.  I don't know. 
[00:38:00]  See?  See?  That's why all you ladies are going to see the movie.  You better believe it.  You don't care that the movie blows.  You just want to stare at him for three hours.  Actually, I do.  I'm disappointed, to tell you the truth.  Well, with all the commercials, I assumed this was going to be an Academy Award winner.  I know.  The way you're promoting it.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  Well, congratulations on the Kiss tickets.  Thanks very much.  This is a lucky Friday the 13th.  All right.  Well, it's not too lucky you're out here today.  You guys are doing a great job.  For you, it's lucky.  Yeah, it's lucky for me. 
[00:38:30]  This Friday the 13th will go down in history.  Trust me.  Right.  You will soon know what I'm talking about.  All right.  But thanks, Annie.  We'll have all my friends in Plainview.  I will.  All right.  Have a great weekend.  You too, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye now.  Yeah, and I know what you did last summer, Blah, Blah, the Bahama movie with Jennifer  Love Hewitt.  Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Horrible reviews, too.  I don't care.  Horrible.  So you're going to go just to stare at it, right?  Yeah, like the girls go to see Brad Pitt.  I want to go and see Jennifer Love.  See, I just can't do that.  You see every ad in the paper for that movie and every ad on billboards, TV ads, trailers. 
[00:39:00]  Her boobs are prominently featured.  Yes, but...  If you look at anything.  But her actual boob size is not as big as the posters.  I noticed that in a few clips of the movie.  She's deceiving.  Sometimes she looks small.  They airbrushed those puppies, made them look a little bigger for you, Anthony.  She has great boobs.  I just don't get it with her.  Why?  I don't...  She's hot.  Yeah, she's hot, but I don't know. 
[00:39:30]  You lose your mind over her.  Look at her butt and everything.  I'd rather go with Drew Barrymore.  Come on.  You need a little bit of skank.  Just a taste of skank in there.  So, all right.  Different, different tastes, Opie.  Yes, I guess, Anthony.  Who cares?  All right.  Hey, I got the telemarketed call from yesterday.  Yeah, we were getting a couple of those coming up on Instant Feedback. 
[00:40:00]  Because we mentioned we were going to play it yesterday, and we never did.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Stone Temple, Pilots, Plush, Police before that, and it's  all right for you.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday, and I must say, once again, the music sounds really,  really good today.  Yeah.  Thank you, Andrea.  We're rocking.  Working our ass off down the hall, because, you know, we did a lot of trashing last week,  so we want to give credit where credit is due this week.  The music has sounded great.  Well, I don't think a lot of the people were responsible for what was going on. 
[00:40:30]  A lot of the people here doing the music.  No, I understand that.  Yeah.  But I didn't want them to think that I was, you know, completely trashing them as well.  No, we just were speaking out on the evolution, the air pollution.  Move on.  Later this hour, when you hear Paranoid by Black Sabbath, be the 10th caller to win a pair  of tickets to the sold-out Kiss show at Madison Square Garden, November 23rd.  We're doing that all weekend long for you, and we're going to get the boys from Kiss to  stop on by our show.  We'll have details soon.  And I got to say it again. 
[00:41:00]  We had Steven Tyler on the phone yesterday, and we asked him to come to the studio, and  he said yes.  He said yes, he will come in.  And we're going to play the tape over and over again until he commits and does it for us.  He better.  Because he's freaking cool.  It's fun to have in.  And the third person on our dream wish list, I should say, is Dave Matthews.  Yeah.  And I want to make that happen, too.  I think that would be really cool.  All right?  Right.  It's FU Friday.  I was just checking the email while STP was playing. 
[00:41:30]  This poor guy.  He blew it so bad.  You know we got the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  Yeah.  Okay, listen to this, Anthony.  I am a 40-year-old auto repair shop general manager in Brooklyn, and I have a small problem.  On Tuesday night, I got my fiancé to give me a Hummer.  Oh, that's good.  It wasn't a complete Hummer, but for a man who never gets one, it was better than nothing.  This occasion is rare, so I consider this an accomplishment.  I mean, like walking on the moon.  My trouble is that I made the mistake of telling her I only did it to brag about getting a Hummer 
[00:42:00]  on Hummer Tuesday.  What a schmuck.  I will now have a better chance of hitting a lottery than getting another Hummer.  Whoa, man.  Gina will be driving home between 4.50 and 5, listening to the show.  Whoops.  Oops.  Why don't you send the email after 5, then, John?  You made another mistake.  This guy can't win.  Can you guys explain to her how important Hummers are in that it's not demeaning to give one, 
[00:42:30]  especially since her fiancé, me, is willing to address her needs in total and for incredible...  What?  So he told his fiancé that he just wanted her to do it so he could brag?  To all his buds and stuff that, you know, he became a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer  Club.  Oh, man.  That's stupid.  But then he has this run-on sentence that doesn't make any sense. 
[00:43:00]  But anyway...  Look, a gift Hummer in the mouth.  Thank you for your help, John.  So she's listening.  Well, she was listening because she only listened to us for 10 minutes.  And then she pops on that 103.5 disco crap.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Please.  God, that station plays one song for 20 straight hours, I think. 
[00:43:30]  It's one song, right?  But I don't know what to tell Gina.  John, John, you blew it.  Yeah.  God, you just got to keep your mouth shut.  You don't do that.  Maybe he was just so excited with the fact that he finally got one.  Guys brag all the time, but you don't admit to your girlfriend that you brag?  No.  Ugh.  Ugh.  They'll never learn, Opie.  We will be inducting new members this coming Tuesday night.  It's going to be a private, his whole career in this little organization. 
[00:44:00]  Never getting any more stripes.  Ugh.  Poor guy.  And we are working on some type of bumper sticker, so you can put it on your, you know,  your car.  That way you can brag without, you know, brag.  Maybe something like, I'm humming because of Opie and Anthony on WNEW.  Got mine.  Got mine.  Did you get yours?  I don't know.  We'll figure something out.  If you want to help us with some type of slogan that we can put on a bumper sticker, we definitely  encourage you guys to help us develop this show. 
[00:44:30]  So send it in to us.  A big F you to every long distance phone company that wants me to dial 1010 anything.  When I see their commercials, I can't get to the remote fast enough to change the channel.  I will never use their services.  Come on with Dennis Miller.  I don't know.  They've made it so confusing, though.  I don't know what to do now.  1010, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 9, 8, 7, 2.  3, 2, 1, 10, 8.  Honestly, if I had to use the 1010 thing right now, I wouldn't know what to do because they  have completely confused the issue. 
[00:45:00]  And whatever hip credibility Dennis Miller had with his talk show, you know, goofing on  everybody and how, yeah, this guy doesn't know anything about what a shill for this and  that.  And all he's doing is shilling for that company.  Yeah.  He looks like a dork doing it.  Mm-hmm.  He sold out.  That's it.  He sold out.  A lot of the comedians sell out.  Paul Reiser.  Oh, get him off TV.  He's just not funny.  George Carlin's doing one now.  George Carlin's doing one too?  Yeah.  Where he's like doing stand-up on a stage and it's all about his 1010 whatever.  10, 2, 8, 9, 4. 
[00:45:30]  Whatever it is.  You know, when I pick up my phone, I just dial the number.  That's what I do.  Mm-hmm.  I dial the number.  What's with the 1010?  And while we're on the subject of comedians, I wanted to bring this up earlier this week.  I didn't believe you about a month ago.  But I was flipping by the FX channel.  Yeah.  And Bobcat Goldthwait, who's never, ever, ever been funny in his entire career.  Yeah.  Never has.  But he's one of those lucky stiffs that, you know, they open the door for him in Hollywood 
[00:46:00]  and they never kick you out.  I don't understand that logic.  Once you're in, you're in.  Forever.  Tom Arnold's part of that club.  Yeah.  Bobcat Goldthwait.  And there's just a ton of people that, you know.  The entire cast of the Police Academy movies.  Yeah.  Sinbad.  Yeah.  He had his chance.  Kick him out of Hollywood.  But no, they'll give him a million projects.  Sinbad, who now looks like G.I. Joe with the lifelike hair.  You see him on his show?  He's got the real thin, like the short cut hair.  He looks like G.I. Joe with the lifelike hair.  Does he have the Kung Fu grip?  Kung Fu grip. 
[00:46:30]  Hold the mic.  So I'm watching Bobcat Goldthwait's stupid TV show.  By the way, we blew him off because he wanted to be on our show.  And he's doing our bit.  Yeah.  He's doing our high mom bit.  I saw that and I was like, all right, well, let's just see where it's going.  Maybe it takes a different tack.  And it didn't.  It was the exact same thing.  Trust me, it's our bit.  Simple as that.  The girl call up her mother.  Yes.  And tell her that she was in a porno movie.  Yeah.  And they only give the girls 30 seconds, so there's never a chance for it to ever be funny. 
[00:47:00]  It doesn't establish.  There's a whole wheel of things like, hi, mom, I'm in porno.  Hi, mom, I'm pregnant.  Hi, mom, I'm getting married.  Hi, mom, I'm in jail.  Yeah.  All these that we have done in the past, a bunch of them are on our Demented World CD that  you can't find in New York, but whatever.  But he's doing our bit.  And he's doing it badly.  I don't think that show will last, so I wouldn't worry about it.  Bobcats.  Big ass show.  Yeah, funny.  It was funny for about two minutes. 
[00:47:30]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Scorpions rock you like a hurricane.  Kenny Wayne Shepard before that.  Blue on black.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  Talking about what's been going on around New York the last few days.  We almost forgot about Joe Torre, Manager of the Year.  Woo-hoo.  Yay.  Earl's all excited over there.  Woo-hoo.  He did a fine job.  The man deserves it.  They should throw him a ticket tape parade.  Screw John Glenn.  Give it to Torrey. 
[00:48:00]  Well, he had his ticket tape parade with the Yankees.  True.  Did Georgie Corky Steinbrenner have a comment like he did after the Yankees won the series  in the locker room all drunk or whatever he was with his crazy Eddie suit on?  I don't know.  He wears that all the time, too.  Yeah.  Every time he's seen him, he's got the turtleneck and the blazer on.  Crazy Georgie!  Did he say,  Joe Torre's the best manager in baseball? 
[00:48:30]  I just gotta say.  I've known him for years.  Turn into Corky Steinbrenner.  I'm Joe Torrey.  Joe Torrey, best manager in the baseball game.  He won the big baseball game for the Yankees.  He's the best baseball manager game.  My name is Corky Steinbrenner. 
[00:49:00]  And he's the best Joe Torrey.  He's the best baseball.  I'm on a corn dog.  I'm on a corn dog, Joe Torrey.  My name is Corky Steinbrenner.  I'm on a corn dog.  You're our manager of the year.  You're the bestest in the baseball game.  Right? 
[00:49:30]  That's right.  They call my name,  Georgie Steinbrenner,  in my name.  And we won the baseball game.  Because Joe Torrey,  my name is Corky Steinbrenner.  Yeah, I'm on a corn dog.  Give me my corn dog.  Give me a corn dog.  I thought we retired that bit.  Corky Steinbrenner,  in my name.  And we won the corn dog.  Give me a corn dog.  Oh, corn dog.  Give me a corn dog. 
[00:50:00]  Ah.  So, congratulations to Joe Torrey,  back at the end of the year, yes.  Wish him well.  Wish him well, of course.  1027 WNEW,  the rock of New York,  Cracker and Lo.  Black Sabbath, Paranoid.  That was the song you had to be listening for this hour,  to win the tickets to see KISS.  And Eddie Krieger of Scotch Plains, New Jersey,  he was paying attention,  and he's got some tickets to the sold-out show.  Congratulations, Eddie,  and thanks for listening.  We appreciate it.  Yes, we do. 
[00:50:30]  The KISS winning will continue with Matt DeVote.  He's down the hall.  He's making his way to the studio.  He'll be in here in just a few minutes.  I guess we're out of here.  We're done, Ski, man.  Done, Ski, for another week.  Thanks for listening.  We really appreciate it.  Starting the weekend.  Yes.  Yeah, Monday we'll be back.  Don't worry.  Don't fret, people.  Yeah, we'll be back.  Well, I'm not saying nothing.  No, I'm just saying that most people,  or at least some people out there are like,  I wish you wouldn't come back. 
[00:51:00]  We understand.  We do understand that.  But we're building our army.  We are building our army.  We know you're out there.  We always talk about the negative side of this whole mess of rebuilding a station,  but we do know that there's a lot of people catching on and digging what we're doing.  There's a vibe, man.  I want to thank you guys.  We know you're out there.  You tell us with your email and your faxes and your instant feedback and your phone calls.  So, thank you.  All right, let's get out of here. 
[00:51:30]  There's nothing else to say, I guess.  Play the music.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. </pre>
