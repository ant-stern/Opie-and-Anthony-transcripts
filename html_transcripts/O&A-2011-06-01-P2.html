<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The "After Opie & Anthony Live" broadcast with Sam Roberts began with playful ribbing of studio engineer Mars, evolving into a debate about the hosts' actual feelings towards him. This led to a bizarre game attempting to coax Mars into saying "Chick-fil-A."  The conversation then shifted to a discussion of push-up form and the subjective nature of "pass" or "fail."

A substantial part of the show focused on a mysterious Opie and Anthony staff meeting.  Mars recounted a coworker, Roland's, alleged account of the meeting's directives regarding on-air versus off-air conduct, particularly the acceptable use of offensive language.  Roland supposedly cited an example of permissibly calling Mars a "fag" on-air while maintaining respectful off-air interactions.  Roland was subsequently called on-air, partially refuting Mars's version of events.  The conversation briefly touched on other topics, including "Sons of Anarchy," Anthony Weiner's "Wienergate" scandal, and a "Inspirational Jimmy" segment featuring ironically uninspiring tweets.  A listener called in, requesting bagel and bakery recommendations from Roland.

Later in the show, Club Soda Kenny, who had also attended the meeting, joined the conversation.  The broadcast also mentioned a news story about Memorial Day incidents and a previous report about a "leprechaun" sighting.  The show concluded with promotional plugs for Sam Roberts' "Poundstone Power Radio" and further humorous banter between the hosts and Club Soda Kenny, primarily focused on his Facebook page and lingering details about the Opie and Anthony staff meeting.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Mars is trying to look busy in here.  The engineer is just tightening up mic stands for no reason.  He's just tightening and untightening them, so it looks like he's doing something.  Like, so there's some reason for him being here. 
[00:00:30]  Eric, why do you guys always pick on Mars?  I never say anything to Mars.  Why? You don't like him?  I just have nothing to say to him.  Wow. Did you hear that, Mars?  I don't pick on him. I say hi in the morning, and that's about it.  Why don't you have anything to say to him?  Because he's a busy guy. What am I going to say to him?  Okay, Eric, why don't you speak candidly like you do with me?  I just have nothing to say to him.  Why don't you speak like you do when you're in the office?  How come I'm the only one who can speak honestly on the radio? 
[00:01:00]  I never mention Mars ever.  Why not? I mean, you mention other people that you like.  I don't hate Mars. I have nothing to talk about him.  I don't hate Mars. You know what that means, Mars.  I don't like Mars.  He doesn't like me.  But I don't hate him.  He doesn't want ill to come of you or your family, but if you weren't here anymore, that'd be okay with him.  That'd be okay. He wouldn't even miss me at all.  No, that's exaggerating.  Wait, if Mars...  Well, you know what, Eric?  Eric, Sam's a fucking shit starter, so don't even let him do this. 
[00:01:30]  I love you, Eric, and Eric loves me, I hope.  He just said...  Eric, I never said I had a problem with Mars.  If Mars got reassigned to a different show...  That would suck.  You think that would be good or bad for this show?  Mars is great radio for this show.  He just said it would suck.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Mars is great radio for this show, or he's a great radio engineer for this show?  He's great radio for this show.  Wow.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Okay.  My job is great.  When you guys are not asking me for stuff, or making me modify anything, or telling me 
[00:02:00]  there's nothing wrong, and you don't see me, that's when I'm doing my best work.  Tell me, what's that show about the motorcycle gang on FX?  Sons of Anarchy.  Very good.  Somebody's been practicing.  And how about the chicken restaurant down by NYU?  You know which one.  It's not KFC or Popeyes.  It's the other fast food chain that does chicken.  They're closed on Sundays. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, okay.  Where are you going, Mars?  I was thinking Polo Tropical.  No, no, no, no, no.  Polo Tropical.  Except he said Polo.  That's a good one.  He said Polo, though.  Yeah, I know.  It's two L's.  I know.  Pollo.  Pollo.  Pollo.  What was that?  What's the...  In English, what's the other chicken restaurant?  Chicken.  Didn't they all care?  Do you whisper something?  What is it?  I don't know the answer to that question right now.  Yes, you know.  I will come back to you.  No, no, no.  Tell me in your head.  What's the name of the place?  You can see the sign in your head, right? 
[00:03:00]  You know the place I'm talking about.  You see it.  Red letters, right?  You know what I'm talking about.  Red on white.  Yes, I know.  What's the name?  The Chicken Place.  Yeah, what's it called?  The Chicken Place that originated in...  I think...  Did it originate in Philadelphia?  I'm not asking you for trivia.  I'm asking you what the name of the place is.  It's not KFC.  It's not Popeyes.  Chickafill.  The only thing I come up with in my head... 
[00:03:30]  Uh-huh.  Chickafill?  Chickafill.  I don't know.  Chickafill.  What is it?  I'm not going to tell you.  Come on.  That's better than the last time you guessed it.  You thought it was Philichick.  Chickafill.  Chickafill.  Don't you have some shit to play, bro?  Yeah, at some point, I guess.  Okay.  Don't get Opie angry.  Well, you make sure his mic's all...  Because you were tightening the mic stands over there, but you weren't tightening Opie's  mic stand.  No, you know what it is?  And you know what you said, too? 
[00:04:00]  What?  I said, aren't you going to do Opie's mic stand?  You said, fuck Opie.  No, actually, I said, those three mics are always squared away, meaning O and A in Jimmy's.  That is what you said.  To be honest, Marge said, no, I make sure those three mics are squared away, and beyond that,  fuck the rest of y'all.  No, actually, it's this arm.  Once you remove the mic from the arm, the arm does have a play, and it raises.  It's supposed to do that, but I guess people don't like that.  I haven't spoken to you since Friday.  My push-ups were better push-ups than E-Roc's, right? 
[00:04:30]  Okay, let me get back on that.  I also had some peer pressure.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Jimmy said, they're good.  Okay.  Speaking of E-Roc's.  Yes, they're good, and they were good.  They were fine.  They were not as deep as yours.  Again, I have to stand by what I said.  Not to say it's a reversal decision, not to say mine were faster, but my push-ups were  better push-ups than E-Roc's.  Okay, if we're talking quality and how deep you are. 
[00:05:00]  Not for this competition, but quality of push-up, mine were much better.  I can say that, yeah.  But it was a pass or fail test.  Right.  It's not all, you know, I'm giving you an 80 or a 90, so.  But mine were better.  That said.  But he won the competition.  I didn't ask about the competition.  Competition's over.  Of course.  But quality, like in terms of like going forward in life.  Right, but that's not the point of the competition that you had.  But what's the point of life, though?  I don't know.  To be the best at everything you could do, right?  Well, for some people. 
[00:05:30]  That's my thing.  Some people just want to be mediocre and just, you know, pass along.  Is that the Eric thing?  No, that's the pass or fail thing.  Oh, okay.  That's the pass.  You just want to pass.  Yeah, that's it.  It doesn't matter to what level.  Exactly.  Where are you at on that level?  Pass or fail?  You're a pass or fail type of guy.  No, it depends on the test.  Like the test of engineer for the Opie and Anthony show.  You're like pass or fail guy.  Pass or fail.  If the shit works, I'm good to go.  Okay.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  It doesn't have to look pretty.  Yeah.  It doesn't have to be all soldered nice.  I could have electrical tape all up. 
[00:06:00]  You're all up in the console.  You guys, duct tape is holding shit together.  You don't know that.  As long as everything doesn't explode before 10 o'clock.  Because you don't care about this show.  Who?  This show?  No, this is still an extension of the ONA show.  So I do care.  But as long as everything is fine until 11, that's good for you.  At 11, you know, they can call me.  But they have another option as well.  Okay, I see.  They can call directly to BNOC as well.  There's always stuff going on here.  You know anything about this meeting opening Anthony are in? 
[00:06:30]  Today's a meeting day.  Yeah, and Anthony's loving it.  I do not know.  But I know that Kenny is also involved in a meeting.  Same meeting.  Different meeting.  Oh, you're nodding.  Kenny's in a meeting too.  Oh boy.  I was wondering where that big lumbering fool is.  Because, by the way, this is after Opie and Anthony live.  I don't even think I introduced the show today.  Today's a meeting day, which very rarely happens.  A lot of peer pressure went on from bosses to make sure that Opie and Anthony stayed for meetings. 
[00:07:00]  They were out of this studio very quickly trying to get this meeting started and ending.  I don't know what the meeting's about.  I know that Norm, me, or Danny, or E-Rock, or Travis, or any of us were invited to the meeting.  Which is fine.  And I guess now we're finding out Kenny also is in a meeting.  Because usually he has to stay here because he has to drive them home.  But hopefully the meeting will be over before this show is over.  And I'll get somebody in here because I've got to get to the bottom of this. 
[00:07:30]  I was also informed that yesterday's meeting, you guys were told that everything that's said on mic, on air, is good to go.  Yeah, I guess.  But once we are off mic, we have to go back to being civil to one another.  If that's an option.  I mean, if that was a problem.  Yeah, I mean, we're supposed to treat each other like human beings.  Where did you get that information from?  Because you weren't in there.  From Roland?  Roland told you.  What?  Wait, did I?  Was I not supposed to say that? 
[00:08:00]  I was going into the mode where I would start prying you, trying to get a name.  And you just said, Roland told you.  So Roland was what?  Was I not outside telling you that he could say?  No, informing his fellow employees of what was said at that meeting for those of us that did not attend.  And did you not realize that you're supposed to act like a human being off the air?  Oh, I know that.  Right, yeah.  I know that, but it was put out in a meeting.  Oh, where's Roland?  I've got to find out where this guy is.  Iraq, where is Roland?  I don't know. 
[00:08:30]  I've been calling.  He's probably hanging outside wherever the meeting is so he could pitch a guess.  Yeah, really?  And so he can gossip and tell Mars in the hallway later.  No, it's not gossiping.  He's informing his fellow co-workers.  Was he informing you or was he gossiping a little bit?  No, he was informing.  He was actually informing me.  I swear to God.  What did he say?  Exactly what I just said.  Not verbatim, you know, but more or less.  He said you could talk shit on the air, but you have to act like a person off the air?  Yeah, like he even used an example.  What was the example?  His example was. 
[00:09:00]  Roland's example, not yours.  Not mine.  No, it's not yours.  Because I wouldn't have brought this up.  And not even the person running that meeting's example.  This is Roland's example.  I can't Roland again.  Roland can come in here.  Wow.  Get on mic.  Uh-huh.  Call me a fag.  Wow.  Till-  Jesus.  Not on this show.  I don't accept that language.  Till he's blue in the face.  Uh-huh.  But once the mic cuts off and we step out this room, I'm back to being a heterosexual.  Is that how?  Okay?  So we have to refer you as Mars the heterosexual once we're outside this room. 
[00:09:30]  But Roland has to, you know, do the thing.  He has to call me like, you know, I don't want him to, but he has got to call me fag on air.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  And then all fair, I'm back to being straight.  And he goes, like, he comes off and he goes, Mars, I'm sorry I called you that you're a heterosexual.  It was for the show.  Wow.  I mean, I guess I must have missed something in the meeting because-  Were you there?  I was there, but I didn't get a lot of this.  Did you get that message as well?  Not really.  Oh.  Okay.  I mean, I understand treating people like human beings. 
[00:10:00]  We are in a professional atmosphere, but I don't know.  I would love to hear what Roland, what on earth Roland was talking about.  We might have him.  Hang on.  He is hanging outside the meeting because he has guests to pitch.  I'm trying to get him to call the hotline, so hold on.  It might be a language thing.  Since you were in the meeting.  On whose end, though?  Yours or Roland's?  Either one because we were both wetbacks, you know.  Oh.  Actually, actually.  There's Roland.  Actually, here's the wetback.  I'm Puerto Rican.  I got papers.  I could fly over here. 
[00:10:30]  No, we're not all the same.  I wasn't going to say the same.  Yes, the motion that you did with your hands, just because radio people can't see that.  Like, similar.  See, no.  Similar, yes.  There's Roland.  Roland, come in here.  Can you hear me?  Hi, Roland.  Hello, sir.  How are you?  Hello.  Did you hear what Marge just said?  No.  He said you were outside in the hallway telling him what happened in the meeting yesterday.  No.  No.  The highlights.  The highlights.  I said that he was informing his fellow co-workers on things that we need to be aware of. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, just don't forget to treat people respectfully and there's people walking around.  Well, no.  Marge said that you could call him the F word.  He gave me an example.  Yeah.  An example was that he could call me fag on air.  Yeah.  And then, but then once, outside the studio, you're back to...  Right here.  He's on me.  You're right there.  Right here.  We're back.  We're back to...  This is a weird thing.  I mean, I don't even...  I think I was at a different meeting, because I don't know any of this.  No?  You were there. 
[00:11:30]  Remember when then somebody made a comment and then Gary just looked like...  What do you mean?  No.  What are you talking about?  What do you mean?  He said, like, he said, just over here, this is what...  Whatever happens here, happens here.  Whatever happens in the studio, happens in the studio.  Just like in Las Vegas.  Whatever happens in Las Vegas.  Just stays in the studio.  Yeah, so I just broke it down the simplest way.  But then who made a comment?  No, nobody made a comment.  Oh, I don't know.  Okay, you're rolling your eyes a lot.  There's things that happened in the past.  This is weird going on.  Well, I'm just going to see a story coming up or not. 
[00:12:00]  Why, you're pitching gas?  Yeah.  I hope it's a good meaning for your story.  Do you remember, like, for example, when he talked about Master Poe's dog?  Oh, that's like it.  That was just on the air.  Okay.  Okay.  Off there?  Yeah, off there, I love Poe.  Yeah.  Even though if he's in Florida doing whatever criminal activity he's doing.  Eric, does any of this make...  You were in the meeting.  Does any of this make any sense to you?  I'm lost.  Totally like...  I was doing something else, but Roland never makes any sense.  Okay, good.  It's not just me.  Can you put your headphones on for a sec, Roland?  What?  Somebody's got a question for you. 
[00:12:30]  Hey.  I was doing phones, so I said you could call back during the after show.  Yeah, what's up, Ben?  What's up, Rob?  Roland's in here.  Oh, Roland, yeah.  I've been calling just because I needed to ask you a quick question.  I need to know the best bagel place uptown and the best bakery on the island.  Ooh, a challenge.  What part of uptown?  Um, I'm going to be up at the Essex house this weekend.  Oh, on the West Side?  Yeah.  Hmm, that's a tough one. 
[00:13:00]  Best bagels.  There's a place...  It's a Jewish...  Okay, wait, how about this then?  How about this?  Give me the best bagels in Manhattan then, period.  Best bagels on the island, Roland.  I'm trying to remember the name.  It's a Jewish bakery on, like, the 110th and Broadway.  I'm trying to remember the name of the place.  I'm white, Roland.  No, 110 is okay.  Well, if not, you go to the 20th, like, the 23rd and between 7th and 8th is Murray's Bagel, which is delicious.  Murray's Bagel on the 20th.  And, uh, what about best bakery? 
[00:13:30]  That's a tough one.  I know.  I mean, you love your baked goods.  Oh, yes, I do.  That's a tough one, though.  Hmm.  Depends on what you're in mood for.  Because every...  Like, some specializes in black and white cookies.  Others have better, like, lemon cookies.  Others have better cakes, pies.  What type of pastry are you looking for?  Let's see.  Let's see.  Cakes and pies.  Cakes and pies.  Billy's Bakery on 19th and 10th.  It's so freaking good, though.  The Billy's guy, you'll see him, like, in a pink sheet chair.  He'll go, hello. 
[00:14:00]  Talk to him.  Be friends with him, because he'll give you the freshest pie.  What's your name of the place again?  Billy's Bakery.  Billy's Bakery.  On 19th and 10th.  All right, Rob.  I'm going with my wife, Veronica.  And she's like, you know, it's going to be our vacation.  Look, Rob, I told you you could ask where the food was.  I didn't ask for the life story.  Oh, Sam, you're killing me!  You know, I don't need the whole thing.  I apologize for Sam's rudeness.  But thank you, Rob.  Listen, all you guys, I love you guys. 
[00:14:30]  Thanks a lot for everything, all right?  Love you, too.  All right.  See you.  All right, we should play some O&A material while we're waiting for it.  It'll be nice for the past two weeks to play one clip.  Well, because I fall into this zone where Roland's talking about God knows what.  What?  You can't talk to me like this off the air, correct?  Off the air?  I'll be like, Sam, you were brilliant.  Okay, thank you.  Okay, all right.  I'm starting to figure out what you're talking about, then.  I would love to find out what brought this on, too.  Anyway, when are we going to play? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, yes.  It was, what, one year ago today.  We were talking about Twitter with, what's his name, Wiener, Representative Wiener, Anthony  Wiener.  He's all over the news.  Wienergate.  He Twittered some girl a picture of his pelvis with underwear on.  He said he was, you heard it all on the show today.  You know what I'm talking about.  If not, the replay starts at 3 p.m. Eastern.  A year ago today, we were also talking about Twitter, but this time, it was inspirational 
[00:15:30]  tweets from Jim, something we grew to call Jim-spirations.  Inspirational tweets from one year ago today on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  You know, Anthony, you should really look at your tweets and realize that there's anger  there that should be, shut the fuck up.  Why the negativity?  Because there's nothing worth tweeting except negative shit. 
[00:16:00]  Like if you're pissed at something, if you want to yell, if you read someone else's Twitter  and you're like, you're a fucking asshole, like that, what am I going to tweet about?  Oh.  I've seen a bird today.  This is nice.  You had a nice tweet about the Blue Angels.  You were excited about that.  I did, but I also said I'd rather pay my tax money to these fighter aircraft than to housing  projects.  So it was a little like, oh, why'd you have to say that?  I said, because they're cool to watch.  Oh, yeah, because you could edit with F-A-18s over... 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, over my head.  Oh, okay, over my head.  You missed the whole word there.  Yeah, I know.  That happens.  It happens.  Over my head makes me not mind taxes so much.  I'd rather pay for one of these than a housing project.  Yeah.  Like, I don't want my tax money.  I want it to go to fighter aircraft.  They're amazing.  That is a cool picture, though.  Oh, fuck.  Goddamn.  What did that sound like when I went over the boat?  Unbelievable.  They are amazing.  They're so fucking loud when they come over you.  Like, they'll fly in front of you, kind of, and then one came right over our head, and 
[00:17:00]  then the rear, obviously the rear of the plane is facing you.  The sound is like a rocket engine taking off.  And it delays, too.  The loudest plane does not inspire as much as the quietest bird.  Exactly.  Fuck, I love it.  Oh, God, I hate Inspirational Jimmy.  Inspirational Jimmy is going to brighten your day, my brother.  Look at this.  Just shut up, Jimmy.  Inspirational.  Inspirational.  An up that is shut is not as good as an up that is open. 
[00:17:30]  Ah.  I'm going to be inspirational.  I know I don't acknowledge Chip, but you know what?  I'm going to fucking embrace Inspirational Jimmy.  That one I can embrace, Jimmy.  Yeah.  It's great.  I love it.  That's true.  Because they're fucking horseshit, like the real ones.  What is that?  A big fucking circle they're making?  They're far away.  The planes get so far away so quickly.  And then, you got sound?  Can you hear the engines?  Here's a...  How the fuck do they do that? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, just about touching.  Yeah.  And it's 18 inches apart.  What?  Yeah.  18 inches apart when they're doing their maneuvers.  They're 18 inches apart?  Yeah.  Some maneuvers are 18 inches wingtip to wingtip.  And then...  No!  Yeah, no shit.  And then one of the planes was doing 450 miles an hour right at the level of the beach. 
[00:18:30]  It just...  And all I can think is, you know what that's got to look like from the cockpit?  Just like 450 miles an hour down the beach.  How do they not just crash all the time?  I know.  They do sometimes.  Flying upside down, fucking next to each other.  Boy, this guy's not flying for continental any time soon.  Wow, Chip.  That's good.  Look at that perfectly synchronized barrel roll with four of them all together.  It.  Yeah.  One of these fucking planes, right?  Yeah.  I don't know if you even know the answer.  New York to LA.  How fast would they do it?  That thing? 
[00:19:00]  Because we're used to what?  A five and a half hour fucking flight?  Going 500 miles an hour.  Yeah.  What would they do?  You need two and a half.  You can make that in a couple hours.  Maybe 42 minutes?  You can make that in a couple hours.  Two hours, you're thinking?  Yeah.  Wow.  Can you imagine?  That would be great.  Yeah, yeah.  You can fucking go to LA for dinner, come back, and be in your own bed.  No problem.  Yeah, that is just insanity.  But to rush to a destination is to abandon a place.  That you've been.  Those are just as good.  It's just as good slash shit as any other inspirational thing. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, no.  Inspirational, Jimmy.  I feel so good now.  It's just the worst.  That's right.  Oh, I hate inspirational, Jimmy.  Because I know I'm just going to read these tweets.  Holy shit, is that good.  It's to abandon a place, but it is.  Maybe get a little box of inspirational quotes in studio.  I like inspirational quotes.  Oh, that's good.  I've always been obsessed with how fucking awful they are.  Because they're not inspiring anybody. 
[00:20:00]  And inspire Jimmy to make inspirational quotes.  That's true.  That's right.  Inspirational, Jimmy.  That's good.  Yeah.  One who doesn't inspire will perspire.  You got my endorsement inspiration, Jimmy.  I'm all in on this one.  I love and inspirational, Jimmy.  And hate him.  All at the same time.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right. 
[00:20:30]  Anything for people that are feeling a little depressed about this oil slick?  Because I know a lot of people are not very happy with it.  It's kind of weighing them down.  The environment is getting messed up.  Everything's getting heavy.  Anything.  Yeah, yeah.  Like the oil.  They shouldn't call it oil slick.  Because anybody slick wouldn't let the oil spill to begin with.  Oh, yeah.  See, that's inspirational.  It's real.  You got to see them.  I don't feel like filming today.  I'll film inspirational Jimmy tomorrow. 
[00:21:00]  Because the hand movements really go with it.  Yeah, there are hand movements.  Jimmy's being very overly dramatic.  And his face, his nose crinkles up and he squints a little.  Well, he's almost like Billy Crystal doing a doodly-eyed time.  He's very heavy.  You don't like that bit?  Ugh.  Well, Katrina took away everything I knew.  Bo-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Can you dig it?  I knew you could.  George Bush didn't send nobody when Katrina hit. 
[00:21:30]  And now we're just sitting here living as best we can.  Bo-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Shut up, you white Jew.  You're not a black guy.  You're not even coming close to being a black guy.  Don't make everyone try to think you know what the hardships of the black man are.  You dumb bit.  Someone who tries to be a black guy is going to get a black guy.  Yes, inspirational Jimmy. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  You know what, Ant?  You hate that bit, but with the fucking oil spill in the Gulf, there's going to be another  one coming because that's affecting Louisiana.  Yeah.  It's starting to affect that fine state.  And I saw, I saw oil washing up on the wetlands, the beautiful wetlands where the Louisiana duck  and the Louisiana snake would play together.  Bo-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could. 
[00:22:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  I notice you're looking at your watch wondering, why is this fucking shit bit going on for 35  minutes?  Oh, God.  The birds.  Everyone hated it.  The birds.  When the Louisiana birds would sing their song.  Oh, and now Mr. Obama looks like Mr. Bush, but in the oil spill.  In the oil spill.  It's the same thing, only he covered with oil. 
[00:23:00]  A boo-da-da-da-da.  Oh, doo-doo-doo-doo.  After O&A, it's live.  That's what it is.  After Opie and Anthony live.  I'm Sam Roberts, and look who's out of his meeting.  That's right.  Club Soda Kenny.  Mars came in here and told us that you also had a meeting aside from Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Where's my theme song?  You have a theme song?  I should.  Eric, does Kenny have a theme song? 
[00:23:30]  The only one I knew was in his replay, but we took all those out of here.  Remember back in the day, one of the listeners made the song for me?  Why don't you sing the song way back in the day that you used to sing for your own theme  song?  How'd it go?  Here's Club Soda Kenny.  He's big and stupid.  Yeah, that's a good one.  You're not going to sing it, though?  I don't remember it.  I don't...  Well, Eric, could you put something on for his theme music? 
[00:24:00]  You got all the music in front of you.  Yeah, I'm looking for something.  I mean, you know...  I've only been standing here for five minutes.  Exactly.  It's not like he just got here.  He was here all the bit was playing.  Oh, Eric.  Oh, well.  Eric.  He was enamored by me, so I can't blame him.  He's starstruck?  Yeah.  So you had a different meeting from Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, it was about Facebook.com slash Club Soda Kenny.  No, it wasn't.  And if it was, it should have been about stop plugging that on the air.  Why? 
[00:24:30]  Where's the song, Eric?  Let's talk about all the stupid people that like my imposter page.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  I'm standing here talking to you.  Eric's talking in my ear saying he's doing something else.  What could he possibly be doing?  We're live.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  So, Sam, how was your holiday weekend?  It was good.  I mean, this week has not been great because Eric's doing other things.  He won't play a song for you.  It's all right.  I forgive him. 
[00:25:00]  How was your holiday weekend?  Memorial Day weekend is a very, like, sad holiday.  Because you remember the troops?  Yeah.  So what?  That's it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, everybody does their thing.  What did you do?  I do what I do.  You do what you do.  You just worry about you.  Well, I'm talking to you.  I'm trying to have a conversation with you.  No, I was talking to you. 
[00:25:30]  Let's get this straight.  Did you hear that tonight I'm going to be hosting Poundstone Power Radio?  Yes, I did.  I heard that yesterday on the after hour.  It's on Sirius 92 XM 207, I think.  Yeah, I want to know.  It's tonight, 7 to 9 p.m. Eastern.  I'm co-hosting with Poundstone Power.  Well, it's Covino's problem that he couldn't do it.  Covino had other arrangements.  He's usually the co-host from Covino and Rich.  And he couldn't make it.  So somebody called me and said, hey, can you do this? 
[00:26:00]  I said, yes.  I'm the yes guy.  Yes is the answer.  Sam, you want to hear something funny?  I always want to hear something funny.  Since you were talking about my Facebook.  Nobody was talking about your Facebook.  The Covino and Rich show have their own Facebook page.  Yeah.  So like yesterday, they invited their listeners to have dinner at Famous Dave's Barbecue.  Uh-huh.  So I commented on the Facebook page.  Okay, that's not funny.  No, the comment was.  Oh, what was the comment?  Do they pull pork? 
[00:26:30]  Why'd you say that?  It's hysterical.  Yeah, I don't think so.  And I also commented on Troy Kwan's page.  Troy's been out with jury duty.  I know.  I made two comments.  One, he commented there was free Wi-Fi.  Don't talk over me when I'm talking.  The Facebook talk is killing me.  Why?  You got more pages than me.  Yeah, but I don't talk about them.  I'm not sitting here just chatting about my comments I left on Facebook. 
[00:27:00]  What difference does it make?  Let it live on Facebook.  Yeah, but this is interesting.  People want to know.  No, it's not.  People can just go to Facebook if they want to know.  Listen to me.  So Troy Kwan posted that there was free Wi-Fi at jury duty.  Like, what should he do?  And I commended him for doing his civic duty and his other duty.  That's great.  That's hilarious, Kenny.  I'm sure there's a four-year-old who's laughing at that somewhere.  I know.  I'm very immature.  Where do you...  Also, Troy Kwan, you know, he's a DJ at a club in the meatpacking district in New York City. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, we've heard about that.  Yes.  Yeah.  So, like, last night, he posted that he was going to be DJing.  Okay, so what?  So I commented on that.  I go, when Troy Kwan makes the music, chicks get wet.  That's just vulgar.  It's not even funny.  It's not vulgar.  It's complimentary.  That's not a word.  Eric, now you're back and you're laughing.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course he's laughing.  He knows what humor is.  Where are you at with all the Memorial Day rowdiness talk that's been going on on O&A for the past couple days? 
[00:28:00]  I haven't heard any.  What do you mean you haven't heard any?  You've been listening.  You're supposed to be listening to the show.  I do, but I've got two years.  I listen to one show in one ear, the other show in the other ear.  You just said you hadn't heard any of the clips.  Yeah, well, you want me to admit to anything?  Oh, my God.  You were a cop.  Did you ever have to deal with that stuff?  What are you talking about?  Deal with what?  The opening Anthony show?  No, that's not what I'm talking about.  You're not paying attention. 
[00:28:30]  I'm so poor I can't pay attention.  That's not even the right wording for the joke.  What is it?  I'm not going to tell you.  You don't know it.  What I was trying to get at was, you know, with all the news stories about the people  have been posting of black people going crazy, like on Memorial Day.  That's what we've been talking about.  Whether it was them closing the water park or Myrtle Beach yesterday.  One of the...  You know what I say, Sam?  No. 
[00:29:00]  Peace and love.  Great.  One of the first stories...  Peace and love, Sam.  Thank you for saying that.  I like the vibe that you put out in here.  One of the first stories, though, that we ever talked about on the air...  Sam, it's old news.  Don't you have an agenda?  Yeah, and you're derailing it at every turn.  Yeah, because, you know, people want a little something more in this after hour.  They don't want to rehash the same shit.  What are we rehashing?  You're talking about what happened days ago. 
[00:29:30]  I'm explaining what happened yesterday and today and bringing it to something now.  Is that okay?  All right.  Okay.  The first story that was like this that we did on the air...  Because nowadays, newscasts become viral videos like nothing.  Because every news station puts their newscasts online.  It's a smart thing to do.  It wasn't always this way.  And one of the first newscasts...  Get to the point, please.  ...to go viral was, of course, Leprechaun in the Tree. 
[00:30:00]  It's something we've had fun with on the show for a long time.  Something that I felt, and we, as a staff, felt...  And by we, I kind of just mean me and Eric, because we were talking about it in the other room while the show was on.  That we felt would complement the stories of today that we talked about.  Not of today meaning of present time.  Meaning, literally, what we spoke about today.  I have nothing to say about that.  Here it is.  Don't play anything when I'm here. 
[00:30:30]  Well, what am I?  I'm not going to keep talking to you.  You're boring.  I'm not boring.  Yes, you are.  No, you're boring.  No, I'm not.  I do this every day.  Let's take a call and see who's boring.  There's nobody on the line because nobody wants to talk to you.  Exactly, because you're boring.  Nobody wants to talk to you.  This.  Wait a minute.  Eric.  Yes, Kenny.  Settle this.  This whole thing's boring.  Thank you, Eric.  Oh, Eric, come on.  You didn't mean that.  This is Leprechaun in the Tree on After Opie Anthony Live.  Eric just gets, you know.  Just play the clip. 
[00:31:00]  After Opie Anthony Live.  Goodbye.  ...leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community.  Many of you bring binoculars, camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it look like a Leprechaun to me.  I got to do a little bit of the tree.  Who else in the Leprechaun say yeah?  Yeah!  Eyewitnesses say the Leprechaun only comes out at night.  If you shine a light in its direction, it suddenly disappears.  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the Leprechaun looks like. 
[00:31:30]  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  Could be a crackhead that got home to the wrong stuff.  And it told him to get up in the tree and play a Leprechaun.  We're going to get down to the bottom of this.  You got stairs on there, guy.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid, man.  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the Leprechaun. 
[00:32:00]  He's suited up from head to toe.  This was all smells right here.  This is a special Leprechaun flute, which has been passed down from thousands of years ago from my great-great-grandfather, who was Irish.  And I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree.  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree.  I want to know where to go.  I want to go.  Give me the gold.  I want to go. 
[00:32:30]  The crowd started gathering around sunset.  It's a face.  A face.  The eye.  The nose.  The mouth.  The frantic mouth.  The right there.  It's just a face.  And right now, he's not, he's not, he's not happy.  I'm not kidding.  It's a frowning face.  A Leprechaun.  It looks like, let's not look just like a little Leprechaun.  It's still up there.  The people who see the Leprechaun say you can see it better at night.  And that's when the crowds really start coming up. 
[00:33:00]  Now, step back, tell me I ought to see it.  If you just look right there, that's not me.  Do you see it?  Right there, you see it?  Do you see it?  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I'm like, he's smiling right now.  I want to see it.  If it's here, I want to see it.  When is it supposed to pop up?  Well, actually, my brother came in from Atlanta last Sunday night.  And we were standing out, standing around.  And he, like he said, y'all not going to believe this.  But it looks like a man is up in that tree.  And y'all like, man, you crazy.  And pretty soon, there were more people creating traffic jams, all to see what has become known 
[00:33:30]  as the leprechaun.  And he was smiling.  He was smiling, huh?  Uh-huh.  And then one moment, I thought he tipped his hat.  What do you think about all the crowds that have come?  What has it been like the last couple of nights?  Scar's grass.  It looked like monogrow.  All we need is some floats.  Now, some people say they've seen the leprechaun, and some people say they haven't.  But one thing's for sure, nobody's found a pot of gold yet.  After O&A, it's live. 
[00:34:00]  That's what it is.  Celebrating some of the Memorial Day stories.  Is that them coming out of the office right now?  Club Soda Kenny has exited.  He's waiting for Opie and Anthony to leave their meeting.  They still haven't.  Again, I mean, I don't know what Club Soda Kenny's meeting was all about.  I wish I did, but obviously he wasn't exactly a fountain of information.  Peter in New York stayed on hold.  Might as well reward him.  Peter, you're on after O&A.  What's going on, Prime Time? 
[00:34:30]  What's up, Peter?  I wanted to let you know that I think Club Soda Kenny is electrifying.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Did you really think he was electrifying just before that bit played?  Yes, sure was.  Well, maybe I'm wrong then.  Kenny had me riveted.  He's a shockingly talented gent, I'm telling you.  Well, I mean, maybe he should be in this studio more often then.  Thank you, Peter.  You got it.  There were a whole bunch of calls.  All, I mean, to his credit, all of them saying Kenny is not boring, 
[00:35:00]  but they didn't want to sit through the three-minute bit that we just played.  Speaking of that, I also was hoping we could squeeze it.  How much time do we have, Eric?  We got about two and a half minutes.  Oh, I thought we were out of 56.  No, we got a double at the end.  Oh, well, that's too bad.  Yeah.  Well, we don't have a lot of time.  I was hoping to play a little Otto and George material for all of you, 
[00:35:30]  because Otto came in here and he killed today.  Last time, if you remember, who's calling on the hotline right now?  I'll just pick it up.  Don't worry about it, Eric.  Okay.  Uh, hello?  You're boring.  You think that's funny, Roland?  Yes.  Where are you?  In the office waiting.  We're just waiting for them to come out of their meeting?  Yes.  Do you have any idea what they're meeting so long about?  Yeah.  What?  I can't, we'll talk off air.  I don't want to talk off air.  I hate talking off air. 
[00:36:00]  Afternoons?  Well, here's what the meeting's about.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, he got us.  He got all of us.  Because we were all just waiting for Roland.  None of us thought that would happen.  You think it's about afternoons, Eric?  I hope.  Maybe it's about, there's Roland pointing and laughing at me.  That's not funny.  That's not funny, Roland.  And Club Soda Kenny is just lumbering down there,  way taller than everybody else.  Yeah, hopefully tomorrow we'll find out what this meeting was about.  It's probably about nothing in the end. 
[00:36:30]  Don't they all end up being, like, long meetings that aren't really about anything?  Yeah, pretty much.  So you didn't hear what Roland was saying earlier, Eric, about them?  Because he was talking some crazy tale about our meeting yesterday,  saying that we were allowed to say things on the air but not off the air.  I mean, sometimes do you think Roland just takes little excerpts out of meetings  or out of conversations and then clings onto them  and then repeats them all twisted and tangled? 
[00:37:00]  Sometimes conversations with Roland is like,  you ever talk to somebody who's not fully awake?  Like, they just sort of woke up,  but they're still halfway between, like, being awake and sleeping,  and they try to speak and nothing makes any sense?  To be fair, most of the time when you see Roland,  he just woke up.  Okay, fair enough.  So, I mean, that's where some of the confusion is.  Look, we can't stay on all day.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  They've been doing gangbuster shows.  I just wish Ronnie B would come back on this one. 
[00:37:30]  Please tune in tonight, 7 to 9 p.m. Eastern,  on the Sports Play-By-Play channel.  I think it's Sirius 92XM 207.  I think.  I'm almost positive.  If there's any confusion, just look up Poundstone Power Radio.  But I think it's Sirius 92XM 207.  I'll be on with Poundstone from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern time.  That's 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern.  It's a talk show. 
[00:38:00]  It's live.  The phone calls will be open.  So if you want to talk to me then,  you can talk to me then.  Until then,  stay tuned,  because Ron and Fez are next  in the Opie and Anthony show,  as well as after Opie and Anthony live.  Continue tomorrow.  Have a wonderful day.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook  at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live  Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!
