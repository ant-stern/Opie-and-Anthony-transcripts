<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts returning from vacation to a chaotic studio beset by significant technical difficulties with their new audio equipment.  Anthony repeatedly cursed due to Opie's excessively loud microphone in his headphones.  The initial segment was dominated by troubleshooting attempts and exasperated complaints, with on-site technicians present, although off-air technical expert Ed Schwartz was also in the studio. Anthony detailed a stressful commute due to a late wake-up and heavy Long Island Expressway traffic, contrasting sharply with Opie's smoother rollerblading commute.  They also aired their distrust of their agent, Bob, and their procrastination regarding their tax documents.  A heated confrontation with an unidentified “Bernie” led to his abrupt departure from the studio after a dispute involving a CD. The segment also touched upon an upcoming dinner with Bob and an article featuring them in Hustler magazine showcasing photographs from a past broadcast depicting lesbian acts.  Jim Norton was briefly mentioned as a guest, but his participation was minimal.  Promotional announcements and further technical adjustments concluded this section.

The show then moved on to a detailed and graphically explicit discussion of an upcoming Hustler magazine spread featuring photographs of pubic hair from various years, including a lesbian pictorial and nude photos of celebrities.  The hosts received an advance copy and described the pictures in lurid detail, frequently using vulgar language and sexual innuendo. They discussed their own appearance in the magazine, its placement near other sexually explicit content, and their various other media appearances, including a large New York Post advertisement and an upcoming AOL/XM Satellite Radio deal.  A humorous anecdote involving a fan, "Frank from Jersey," prioritizing an Opie and Anthony sign over the safety of a wheelchair-bound individual he was assisting, resulting in the individual falling and soiling themselves, was recounted. The segment included a phone call with Greg from Canada, an update from Lee Abrams (XM Satellite Radio executive), discussions about upcoming projects and marketing deals, and details of Jim Norton’s efforts to secure a photo with Robert Plant for the Hustler article, along with comments on upcoming photo opportunities with Robert Plant and Paul McCartney, and their experiences at a rap concert and a Boston restaurant.  The segment concluded with teasing and berating of Louis C.K. before his scheduled interview.

A phone call with Louis C.K. followed, where the hosts playfully teased him about his success, his book ("Nothing's Sacred"), and his avoidance of their show. Louis joked about his book being a memoir despite his poor memory and his donations to socialist causes. They secured tickets to his Alice Tully Hall show and reminisced about a past arrest involving Louis, Jim Norton, and a "teen voyeur bus." The conversation ranged from Britney Spears' pregnancy to President George W. Bush's alleged iPod playlist, including "My Sharona."  They mentioned their Hustler Magazine appearance, their XM Satellite Radio situation, their "WOW" sticker promotion, Jon Stewart's appearance on Crossfire, and their opinions on current events and politics.  The segment ended with a discussion of a "pickled punk" (a preserved fetus) found in the studio, resulting in near-involvement with the FBI. Jim Norton participated in the conversation.

The discovery of the "pickled punk" became the focus of the next segment. An employee, Mars, who found it and poked it, described the fetus in graphic detail while in-studio, prompting dark humor and offensive jokes from the hosts and Mars.  The conversation abruptly shifted to a news story about a disabled teenage girl who was sexually assaulted in a school auditorium.  The hosts reacted with a mix of shock, disgust, and dark humor, making offensive jokes about the victim and perpetrators, and speculating about her complicity. Several audio clips from sex education recordings for people with intellectual disabilities were played for comedic effect, prompting further offensive remarks from the hosts.  The clips contained explicit conversations about menstruation and sex, presented simply.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Britney Spears’ pregnancy, laced with offensive and sexually explicit jokes, and promotion of "Whip Him Out Wednesday."

The final segment centered on listener-submitted anecdotes about encounters with intellectually and physically disabled individuals.  The hosts shared stories about classmates, including "Dally Dooley" and "Horse Eye Kid," and "Mark" who ate only pizza sauce and crust. They discussed the reduced prevalence of severely disabled individuals in schools compared to their youth, referencing "thalidomide babies" and "flipper kids."  More audio clips from a sex education program for intellectually disabled individuals were played, highlighting the crude and awkward attempts to teach basic sexual terminology and anatomy, including inept explanations of female anatomy and repetitive pronouncements of vulgar terms. A call with "Frank," seemingly a mentally disabled individual, recounting a wet dream in a disturbingly frank and childlike manner, was also aired.  The segment ended with listeners sharing their own "what I learned today" responses, many reflecting the segment's crude humor.

[00:04:00]  XM202  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  We will be in the end of the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I can't breathe.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Quiet.  Hello, cutie pie. 
[00:05:00]  How are you?  It's not a tumor.  It's not a tumor.  And with that, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:05:30]  That was really loud, Anthony.  All right.  Let me try to adjust any of this.  Go ahead.  How does this sound?  A little.  Sounds perfect in my headphones.  Try it again.  This sounds perfect in my headphones.  Okay.  The thing that was supposed to just mix my mic into the whole thing mixes Opie's mic, makes it louder.  So I turn the mix up. 
[00:06:00]  Let me turn this up.  Well, they're going to be fine-tuning the next couple of days, Anthony.  Go ahead.  I'd be in a much better fuck-ass mood if I didn't just get in.  Uh, what?  Yeah.  This is fantastic.  I know it's going to take fine-tuning, and I'm not going to be an asshole and say, why the fuck isn't it all set up and sounding just dandy on, you know, minute one of us being back here.  But I just got my ears blown out by Opie.  That was great. 
[00:06:30]  Isn't one of these things supposed to adjust my mic, and one is supposed to adjust everything else?  The one that adjusts my mic just cranked Opie so loud my fucking ears are bleeding.  And the one that adjusts the mix, I don't know what it does.  Thank you.  Thank you.  40 minutes on the fucking Expressway.  We're going to get into everything in a second.  That's really loud.  Opie is completely blasting my ears out.  I'm scared to talk. 
[00:07:00]  Anthony might turn around and go home.  He might turn around and go home.  All right, he's taking his headphones off.  You try the headphones for a while.  I'll tell you what, Anthony Koeman is not happy.  Koeman.  All right, well, here's the deal.  Let me do the big setup here.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  We're back live in New York for the first time in about, wow, two and a half weeks, I think.  We went on a two-week vacation, and then the first two days back, we did Boston. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, fun up in Boston.  Now we're back home here in New York City in our brand-new studio.  It's been brand-new since we started, but they came in with a whole crew and fixed all the problems, Anthony.  Okay, now I hear you really loud, and I barely, barely hear me at all through the headphones.  Jimmy, could you talk?  Hi, Ed.  Good to see you.  I hear this kind of weird, too.  It doesn't really sound right to me.  No, I'm all...  You want to trade?  Here, look at this.  All right.  Here it is. 
[00:08:00]  Talking to your headphones.  Hey, hey.  Wow.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Opie.  How are you doing?  Wow.  Isn't that great?  Wow.  Isn't that fantastic?  Yeah, it's completely different volumes.  Well, I started moving this around.  Does this help at all when I do this?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Talk.  I don't know what you're doing.  Anything?  I don't know what that is.  What?  What?  Nothing changed, right?  I can't tell.  You sound like you got a little louder.  I did?  Yeah.  Huh.  You're blasting.  I barely hear me.  I feel like I'm underwater. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  I sound like I'm underwater to myself.  Well, the sound thing, you can get over after a while.  You kind of get used to it, depending on different things.  But volume is, you know, volume.  It's, I hear Opie very loud.  I barely hear me.  So, it's pretty much the exact same situation as before I fucking left.  Well, I think I...  Exactly the same.  Everything's fucking loud.  I can't hear me worth a shit.  Thank you.  Two and a half fucking weeks.  Unbelievable.  This only happens, Anthony, maybe three times a year, so sit back and enjoy this one, folks. 
[00:09:00]  That cock-fucking Long Island Expressway.  There's only like three times a year where I'm in a good mood and Anthony's miserable.  Holy shit.  I swear to God I need a drink.  All right.  Well, here's the deal.  So, we're back at our home studio.  And where I sit, everything looks great.  I got to tell you, everything looks great.  The volume in my headphones, perfect for me.  Sounds great in my headphones.  You, I mean.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I wish I sounded like that. 
[00:09:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Well, they'll fix it.  Let me try one of these.  Stop whining.  Perfect.  See?  Stop whining.  That was so like silky smooth in my ears.  It's beautiful.  You've given that to me.  Stop whining.  Oh, it's perfect.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop whining, Anthony.  Stop whining.  It's not about you, douchebag.  I can't help it.  And then I turn the one that's supposed to turn my mic up.  I have two little knobs by me now.  I used to only have one knob open.  Did you know that?  I had one knob here for my headphone volume. 
[00:10:00]  Well, I got two knobs, too.  Now I got two knobs.  One is supposed to adjust everything.  I got two knobs.  One's named Jim and one's named Anthony.  Yeah, a knob.  I'm a nab.  And then the other knob is just supposed to turn my mic up.  And when I turn it up, you get to the point where my ears will drip blood by the end of  the show.  And I just maybe get distorted or something.  I can't tell.  But it doesn't go up.  Well, that's why they're here.  They're going to fine-tune everything.  They recoded everything.  They made my board bigger so I don't have to do things.  Remember when stuff wouldn't play on the air because I had to do different things on the 
[00:10:30]  board that I forgot?  Now it's all set and nice in front of me.  Oh, my God.  My phones are over here so I can look at you still and screen calls at the same time.  Are you all right, pal?  No.  No.  I am so aggravated.  I was a little nervous because Anthony just arrived, which is fine, obviously.  But I knew today would be one of those days to begin with because we're trying out the 
[00:11:00]  equipment for the first time.  So at any given moment, someone could have a problem and lose their mind.  Right.  But you were already going into this situation really, really pissed off.  So I knew this was just a recipe for disaster.  Yes.  Absolutely.  My God damn alarm didn't have any volume.  Didn't have any volume.  I don't know what the reason is or why or how or who.  I had no time to diagnose that fucking problem this morning.  But all I know is I woke up and it was a quarter after six, an hour after I usually 
[00:11:30]  get up.  Now, when you wake up maybe ten minutes late, you pretty much have a shot, right?  Ten minutes.  You shave off some edges.  Well, you figure something you don't need to do.  Ah, I don't need to brush my teeth.  Screw it.  I don't know if I brush the teeth.  Well, you know, but I'm just saying.  I got dressed in record time and flew out the door.  I mean, record time. 
[00:12:00]  But it's an hour.  Dude, it's an hour late that you woke up.  So there's really no shot at making it on time.  And to put it in perspective, Anthony is here by six.  Yeah.  So he woke up at 6.15.  And he still has to commute.  He doesn't live in the city.  I live in the city.  I live 14 blocks away.  Anthony has to commute like 20 miles, which in New York is just death.  But here it is also.  An hour late.  If I woke up an hour later and let's say my commute time was going to be exactly the same as it was, 
[00:12:30]  still wouldn't be that big a problem.  I leave the house at 20 after 6.  I'm in 20 minutes later.  Gives me, you know, 20 minutes to hang out before the show starts.  But that isn't the way things work here in the big city.  The Big Apple New York City.  Every minute that ticks by, the traffic gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.  So you wake up an hour later, forget about it.  When I get up, it's pretty much smooth sailing. 
[00:13:00]  When we used to start at 6, remember the olden days?  It was, there was nobody on the road.  I could do 80 miles an hour the entire way into work.  And get here within 15, 20 minutes.  I've gotten here in 15.  It's usually 20 minutes.  Now that we start at 7, I could get here in 20, 25 minutes.  Which is fine.  I really have no problem with the commute at that hour.  No, when you wake up an hour late, no, no.  Bumper to bumper on Death's Highway. 
[00:13:30]  The Long Island Expressway.  I wish I could just call in an airstrike on that road.  And just watch A-10s come down and firebomb that road.  Oh, I'm stuck in traffic.  Now I'm late.  Stuck in traffic that I'm usually not stuck in in the morning.  And I'm getting phone calls about what I'm going to do with my car.  What do you want to do?  I said, have somebody waiting out in front.  I'm just going to jump out and run upstairs for the show. 
[00:14:00]  Who do you want to park your car?  Poe, Steve, or Ben?  Wow.  Three really bad choices.  There's the choice.  Three horrendous choices.  Do I want the big, heavy, flaming boot on my gas pedal?  Right.  Or do I want Master Poe?  I don't know.  How does Master Poe drive?  I don't know.  Do I want herky-jerky Ben?  I don't think I've ever seen Ben drive.  No one has seen Ben drive.  Does he even have a license?  I've never seen Ben drive. 
[00:14:30]  Come to think of it.  Does he drive?  I really don't know.  He was an option.  But I chose Steve.  Well, I think you chose the best option.  I chose wisely.  And then I get, I've been sitting in the traffic.  I'm waiting to go through the Midtown Tunnel, which is another nightmare.  And I get a call from our own Eric.  Could you meet Poe at the garage and he'll drive?  Like, you don't know.  Do you understand that?  I'm going to have to skid to a stop at the door and run up here to make the show. 
[00:15:00]  There's no garage.  And that's what I did.  I skid to a stop.  Steve hops in.  I say, please tell the monkey at the garage to get me a...  What?  The what?  They are.  They're like monkeys down there.  They just, ooh, ooh, ooh.  They grab a ticket.  They swing to your car.  They get something.  They're mindless.  That's what I mean.  Don't try to make something of this that I don't mean.  I don't know what they are. 
[00:15:30]  They just, I call them monkeys.  Like a monkey could do Eric's job over there.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  And Steve did a great job.  I guess.  No scratches, dings, or dents, Steve?  Well, let's find out how the ride to the garage was.  I'm sure he had to move the seat way back.  Probably.  Probably.  Did he have to move his seat way back?  A little bit.  I tried not to touch it.  Anthony's a very thin person these days.  No problem, Steve?  No, no, I love that car.  Isn't that good? 
[00:16:00]  Wow, that is fancy schmancy.  That is great.  No, it's no problem at all.  That's not even my car.  Oh, no?  My chick's car.  Mine is, that's another thing that's got me upset.  My Escalade is, got battery problems.  I get back from vacation.  The car's less than six months old.  I know!  I was going to say less than a year old, but it's less than six months old.  Dude, I'm livid.  What the hell happened to you?  No, I get up, I get home after vacation, I go to start it, nothing. 
[00:16:30]  This happened once before in the parking garage.  I just assumed one of the monkeys left the lights on or something.  But no!  I try to start it in my garage.  Maybe they're sick of hearing you call them monkeys and decide to do something about it.  No, no, because I thought perhaps that was what happened, but it wasn't.  It wasn't.  I left it in my garage at home.  And dead battery.  So now I've got to drive my girlfriend's car around and mine, I've got to get it fixed, I guess.  I don't know.  How do you do that?  I don't know.  I don't know how to do stuff like that. 
[00:17:00]  Are you kidding me?  I don't do that.  I had to mail something the other day.  I didn't even know what a stamp cost.  You don't know what a stamp cost?  Well, now I know it's 37 cents.  37 cents.  Honestly, I had to mail my birthday card to my nephew down in Florida, and I'm like, wow.  What a nephew, Frank.  I realized that I haven't mailed a letter in years.  No?  I haven't mailed a letter in years.  There's no need to.  I had no idea how much a stamp costs. 
[00:17:30]  There's no need to mail letters.  And I had like 35 cents stamps laying around, so when was it 35 cents?  I couldn't even tell you when they changed those things.  I don't know.  So then I'm confused, and I'm at the post office, and I had to ask somebody.  And they laughed at me.  Of course they did.  So then I had to get like two cents stamps, whatever.  Well, like...  You had to put that little stamp on there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The useless stamp.  I don't know.  I don't know stuff like that.  Did you get your taxes out?  I guess.  What?  Yeah.  I signed something.  Didn't Bob send you all those big envelopes? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I guess.  I signed it.  The sign here.  Don't you feel sometimes that you could just be getting yourself in a lot of trouble?  Yeah.  Because we just get these tax forms, and we're kept men.  We're kept men by our agents and stuff, and there's these little tags on there that say  sign here, and do you look over?  No, of course not.  No, you just sign it.  You pop it in the envelope.  Because the tax packet that we get is, I don't know, it's like 20, 30 pages thick, right?  30 at least, yeah.  At least, and...  And there's a few of them. 
[00:18:30]  Who has time to read?  So I just go where I have to sign, go to that page, and sign, I sign them all, and then  you know what I do?  I double-check to make sure I signed everywhere I'm supposed to sign.  Well, I do that, too.  I don't want it coming back.  That's about it.  Yeah.  Oh, we're responsible.  I double-check my signature, make sure I've signed everything properly.  Anthony and I, we truly believe that we have the most trustworthy agent in the business,  and they're all scumbags.  You know what?  Every single one of them is a scumbag.  But we think we've picked the best one, and we've had him for a very long time, and he's 
[00:19:00]  done right by us.  But we don't know.  We don't know.  That get the agents, and you read in the paper that they were ripped off for millions  of bucks, don't you think they trusted their agent?  Well, Billy Joel.  Completely.  Billy Joel is a good example.  Look at that.  Billy Joel had, what, a family member, like his ex-wife's brother or, I don't know,  somebody very close to him taking care of all his business affairs and took them for  millions.  Yep, took them for millions.  So what chance do we have?  None.  There are times that we get packets from our agent, and we have to sign checks for people 
[00:19:30]  that I've never even met.  Yeah, I don't know.  What do they do for us?  I don't know what some of those names are.  Like, oh, okay, I'll write a check out for that because Bob said so.  Bob could have other IDs with those names on them.  Right.  I don't know.  He's cashing those checks.  So anyway.  Well, I hope he's trustworthy.  Well, this is...  By the way, dinner with Bob next week.  Oh, you got that?  You got that...  I talked to him last night.  You got that call?  Yeah.  Ugh. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, another fun...  You want to come, Jimmy?  Jimmy comes every once in a while.  Want to come to dinner with Bob?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For real?  Sure.  I have a grip.  It's fun.  Yeah.  So you're calming down?  I'm trying.  As I'm talking into this, it's making a...  Just this wacky, muffled sound and...  I don't know.  Well, they're going to fix everything, Anthony.  I just want it to sound like it did in Washington.  I mean...  Without ever having to go to Washington ever, ever again.  I hate to tell you...  What?  But it sounds perfect in my headphones.  Yeah.  So there's always been a problem. 
[00:20:30]  So I think they're going to be able to fix you very easily.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They told me they're going to have to...  Real quick.  Let me hear you.  They're going to have to fine tune.  Let me hear you.  They're going to have to fine tune everything.  Just so I know what good sounds like.  This is how I sound.  How about that?  How about...  Wow, you are loud.  Well, I have no...  Yeah.  You know, I've lost, I don't know, 20% of my hearing easily.  What?  Huh?  What happened?  What?  What?  All right.  All right, so...  So you're here.  Yeah, I'm here calming down, trying to, anyway. 
[00:21:00]  Ed Schwartz is here.  Yeah.  Oh, there's a bunch of people.  He's the rain man that really, you know, recoded this whole place.  They call it recoding or something like that.  I don't know.  I don't know how anyone tested this, Mike, though, and heard this and went, it's a go.  Can we get Ed Schwartz on the air?  It's a go.  Because I walked in and this guy is the most sarcastic son of a bitch I've ever met in  my life.  Oh, really?  And I love sarcasm.  Oh, boy.  He's forced to be here today. 
[00:21:30]  He doesn't want to be here?  Well, he's a very, very busy man down in Washington.  Yeah, you know what I think, too?  Washington is just this pristine, great, technologically advanced environment.  And then he comes here and it's probably like leaving and going to one of those Russian  space stations from our plush, palatial space stations.  Wait, wait, he doesn't want to come on the air?  We're not going to make fun of him.  He's busy.  Oh, he's not like that.  What's he doing?  He's the top.  I mean, you guys got to understand when you're talking satellite radio and all that, the technology 
[00:22:00]  involved is ridiculous.  And he's the top honcho.  He's the guy.  I mean, the stuff they have to do to get all these channels working and satellites up in  the space.  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  And he's the Baghdadi tech guy.  So I walk in and Ed's like, this should be really exciting.  I'm like, what?  This is the first live broadcast that I'm going to be listening to since I was in New York  back in the 70s, listening to Bob and Ray.  Really?  Yeah, basically saying, look, I hope everything works because I need to get back to watching 
[00:22:30]  you assholes.  Yeah, I'm done here.  I'm through with you, tools.  But as dry as can be and as sarcastic as can be, he's abusing me.  It's great.  Yeah, this should be really exciting radio.  Just like the time I listened and watched at the same time Bob and Ray.  Bob and Ray is like two old timers, right?  Oh, yeah.  They're the Opie and Anthony of the 60s.  Jesus. 
[00:23:00]  So he won't come on the air?  He's a very interesting cat.  He'll come in after he finishes fixing Anthony's problem.  Oh, that's what he's doing?  Oh, okay.  From out there, yeah.  Could he jump on mine too?  Do I sound good to you guys?  Yeah, you sound perfect.  You guys all sound perfect to me in the headphones.  I sound horrible to me like I'm underwater.  I can't hear myself.  All right, well, they're going to adjust all this stuff.  Okay.  I have all the confidence in the world.  They really ripped the whole damn place apart while they're gone.  I like that sound we got in Washington.  That's what I got for me. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, lucky you.  It doesn't sound as sharp, which means I feel like I can save some of my hearing in the next  few years.  I sound like underwater.  Really?  Oh, wow, you do.  It's all muckled.  It's awful.  All right, well, they'll work it out.  That's why all the guys are here.  Yep, they didn't leave.  No, they didn't leave.  They weren't stupid.  They weren't stupid.  Are we going to go to the phones at all?  Yeah, I want to try those out now.  See how they work?  Steve on Long Island.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Sugar Tits.  How do we sound on the phones? 
[00:24:00]  You guys sound fine.  Yeah.  I'm fine on the phones.  I can relate to your traffic problem, man.  I'm going east.  I'm in Southampton.  It took me 20 minutes to go a half a mile.  Yeah.  Well, everyone's got to deal with their traffic, but when you're in New York and you're on that  Long Island Expressway, that is the worst traffic in the country right there.  It is just the worst, and it puts you in a mood before you even get to where you're  going.  It amazes me that they haven't figured out that problem. 
[00:24:30]  It just amazes me.  The thing is, I'm a postal worker, so pissing me off this early in the morning is not a  fucking good thing.  You know those postal workers.  Yes, you do.  Especially when these ass clown illegals cut over at the last minute, and there's seven  of them in a car like a clown car.  And I do everything in this fucking makeup.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up, guys.  Yeah, that would be a good idea.  All right.  It's funny, because I'm a suburb guy, big time. 
[00:25:00]  That road drove me nuts when we were doing it afternoons, so we're not even commuting  with the regular rush hour traffic coming and going from New York City.  Nope.  It got so bad when Anthony and I were doing that commute thing, I had to give up.  Yeah, you gave up.  I gave up on where I really want to live, which is in the suburbs.  I like the suburbs, you know?  And I had to finally get a place in New York City.  I just had to do it.  Had to leave you quick.  It was taking us an hour and a half each way, so that was three hours a day, and I 
[00:25:30]  know there's people out there rolling their eyes like, that's nothing, pal, but we're  talking, this is off-peak.  Yep.  Off-peak, three hours a day commuting.  That's before you even do your job.  Yeah, before anything.  Before you get to the place that pisses you off, you're completely pissed off.  That's 15 hours a week that you're in a car, or I would give up and then try the train  thing, and then I finally had to just give up altogether and just decide, well, I guess  New York is a cool place to live.  I'll make it work somehow. 
[00:26:00]  But then doing the morning radio, Anthony figured he could live out there, because you've got  the easy commute in, because no one's on the road yet.  Not on the road.  It's relatively close to the city.  It's not that bad.  Instant feedback.  Everybody checking in saying, Jim sounds low.  Anthony sounds lower than, uh, Jim and Anthony sound lower.  Opie's booming.  Opie's the control freak.  Jimmy and Anne sound like they're five feet from the mic.  Opie's twice as loud as Anthony and Norton.  Wow. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  So that's the problem we have now.  I'm right on the mic, though.  I'm talking real close.  Oh, yeah.  Me, too.  It doesn't matter.  Well, I just turned you guys up over here.  Let's see what happens.  But to me, in the headphones, everything, I'm not even, you know, kidding.  Everything sounds exactly the same.  Sounds awful on the headphones today.  Terrible.  Well, they're going to adjust as we go.  Okay.  It's going to be a little awkward today, you know.  That'll be today's excuse.  Yeah.  I'm scared.  What you've had to do is pot us up on the board to the point where you can't move the  faders anymore.  Yeah.  Well, I'll lower me. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, brother.  I'll turn you guys up and let's see what that does.  There we go.  Oh.  Hey.  Chad in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Chad.  How do the phones sound?  Oh, they sound good.  You guys sound fine.  Good, good, good.  All right.  So maybe that's all.  At least that's taken care of.  Very good.  All right.  Go ahead, Chad.  I sound like crap, though.  I've been sick all week.  But, uh...  Oh, what's the matter, Chad?  Uh, a little sore.  I don't care.  Jimmy.  Had a rough week, Chad.  Who cares?  Uh, just tell Ed to take his, uh, baller Escalade up to the dealership and get that thing  fixed.  They'll give you another Escalade to drive around for a week. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, sure they will.  That's not what happens.  That ain't what happens.  I've had other problems, and they don't do that.  Really?  Bring it in.  Bring it in and leave it there.  You spend all that money on that big piece, and they give you, what, nothing?  Hmm.  All right, well...  Believe me, I'm not happy about that whole situation.  Ah, that's too bad.  I'm not going to badmouth them, because we'll probably get fired, because it's all the same  company.  Is it really?  And General Motors.  You know, they own a big chunk of this.  And, you know, XM's got huge deals with General Motors. 
[00:28:00]  But, so, you know, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, and I want it taken care of.  That's all.  Maybe you can do what I did with my Dell problem.  You go to somebody in the company, and they will kind of backdoor you into somebody who  actually can help.  Oh, how about that?  Yeah, because you don't deal with it through regular customer service.  I don't understand why a battery would go dead like that.  This thing's supposed to have all these safety things in place where the battery cannot go  dead.  You can leave your lights on.  You can shut your car off, turn every goddamn electrical thing on in your car, and walk away.  And the car knows to shut everything down so as not to kill your battery. 
[00:28:30]  I walk out.  Nothing's been on.  Let me try.  Oh, nothing.  Doesn't start.  What the fuck?  Oh, you try.  You just try in this life, don't you?  And you constantly get a big, a big boot in the face.  I was going to say a big wheelchair Fred dildo right in the keister.  Goddamn.  What a disgusting display that was. 
[00:29:00]  Well, we'll get into that in a minute.  I bet the thing that's supposed to protect you from getting turned off is what drains  your battery.  Yeah.  The little machine that tests everything.  That's probably it.  And kills it.  The little gizmo that tells the car to shut down the battery if it's going dead probably  killed the battery.  Let's say hi to Dave in Colorado.  Dave.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, Dave.  How was that snow?  Oh, yeah.  Eat it, buddy.  Hey, where's Anthony this morning?  I don't hear him on the radio.  Oh, brother. 
[00:29:30]  I don't hear him in the background, but...  Oh, boy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He's making me feel just dandy.  Is he freaking out?  Is he twisting off yet?  It's great when Anthony's scumbag.  Shut up.  I hope you die in an avalanche, you prick.  Hey, love you guys, man.  Take it easy.  Bye, Dave.  Bye, mister.  I love these type of shows, because it's very rare that Anthony is just out of his  mind at any given time.  You can hear a string of curse words you've never heard before in your life.  I don't understand.  If only the alarm went off. 
[00:30:00]  I could probably handle the technical glitches.  I was just glad to get back to New York finally, because we've been on the road between vacation  and going down to Washington, then Boston.  It seemed like a whole month.  So I was just very excited to strap on my rollerblades.  Oh, you bladed here today.  My Solomon inline skates.  And that's my new commute now that winter's over.  I'm just very happy.  Opie's skating.  He's a smile on his face as he looks up at the spring leaves coming in, and there's me. 
[00:30:30]  Trying to get here in record time.  My commute was exactly four and a half minutes.  Four and a half minutes?  Yeah.  Nice commute.  And then I have Master Poe at the front door saying how impressive I am on my skates.  Oh, there you go.  A little compliment on your skating prowess.  Well, because you have to go downhill.  That's hard.  To where we broadcast.  Just a slight downhill.  And then I do a casual tee stop in front of him.  Oh, really? 
[00:31:00]  And he thinks that's just amazing and impressive.  How do you keep from getting out of control speed going downhill?  Do you slalom a little bit?  No.  Or do you point your toes in?  No, you just kind of go with it.  Do you make pizza wedges like they teach you in skiing?  Do some tee stops if you have to.  Oh, is that it?  Sure.  Yeah.  I'm like, Poe, if you think that's impressive, get in your car and watch me zig in and out  of traffic during rush hour.  That's good.  That's good.  You'll be like that doctor that got hit with the ambulance.  Holy ass.  Proven there's no God, by the way.  Yeah.  This woman's like this renowned cancer doctor just saving people's lives. 
[00:31:30]  This lady, yeah, I've been reading about her the last couple of days.  She was pretty much the top of her field.  Yeah.  Making a lot of people just, you know, feel as good as they can.  They have the big C and she's been working.  The big casino, Tony.  They've been working.  She's been working miracles with a lot of people and they've been interviewing a lot of  these people that have been cured of their cancer.  And I mean, you can't find one bad thing about this lady.  No.  She gets hit by an ambulance. 
[00:32:00]  Hit by an ambulance.  What?  What irony.  Knocked out.  I mean, she won.  I mean, like Anne said, top of her field, prestigious, winning all sorts of awards.  You know, a lot of these patients have said, you know, a lot of these cancer doctors, they  don't really give a fuck about you.  It's a business like anything else.  But this lady really did care about her patients.  Yep.  Really cared.  Wham.  Dead.  Dead.  Dead.  Right there in the crosswalk.  Dead.  Just in the crosswalk in an ambulance.  You know what?  I got to say.  Just rolls her over.  I got it. 
[00:32:30]  Knocks her over.  I don't know all the details, but if she was standing off the sidewalk in that crosswalk  when someone's trying to make a turn like that, I can't put all the blame on the ambulance.  I don't know, Anthony.  These pedestrians?  Pedestrians?  New York?  They're stupid.  Oh, my God.  I'm in a cardboard tube all of a sudden.  What did you just turn?  Jesus Christ.  I'll be the turn of levels of knobs.  I know.  Well, you know, I want to paint the picture.  We've got tech guys all over the studio right now.  I know.  Crawling around.  Just panicking because they know Ant's going to freak at any moment. 
[00:33:00]  It's funny because when I freak...  Leave it like that.  That'll work for now.  When I freak, people are like, ah, ah.  It's just, oh, he's an asshole.  But when Anthony freaks, it's a whole different thing that happens.  People really get very nervous and on edge.  Yeah.  Because they don't expect it from you.  No, I don't usually do it.  It's just, I explode like that.  I get so pissed off.  Right.  Well, people get killed in the crosswalks almost every day here in Manhattan.  Pedestrians in Manhattan are assholes. 
[00:33:30]  Almost every day.  They're huge inconvenience.  They...  There are a certain amount of lanes of traffic that cars are driving in.  And some of those lanes are sometimes taken up by pedestrians that instead of being on the sidewalk, they're in the crosswalk waiting to walk across.  Yeah.  And now they're taking up the extreme right lane.  They're in there.  So when you go to make those turns sometimes, you have to beep and send them back onto the sidewalk.  And apparently there was some sun glaring in the ambulance driver's eyes and didn't see. 
[00:34:00]  She must have been standing in the crosswalk.  She wasn't on the curb.  So she turned and wham.  Not even hit with the bumper and then thrown like some of those things.  Just hit with the tires.  Yeah.  When you're hit with the tires, it's over, Johnny.  Of course.  Especially in an ambulance.  I'm getting really distracted because one of the text guys is giving me the signal like...  You need to cut my mic off because he's...  Well, your mic is cut off.  Cut off.  Is that what he was telling me to do is to cut your mic?  All right.  Jimmy's out.  Jimmy's out.  Jimmy, out. 
[00:34:30]  Done.  Hey, it was nice working with you.  Back to Opie and Anthony.  There you go.  It was all about us anyway.  Back to the old days.  Thank God.  You got a phone, Opie?  Let's make a prank phone call.  We'll make it like the older days.  All right.  It's going to be a little weird today, guys.  Yeah.  You know, just like we told you when we were in Boston yesterday.  Yeah.  We have excuses for every day.  Well, that's nice, though, because now we can tell people to look forward to tomorrow's show.  Right.  Now, we'll get some good shit.  There's always something to look forward to on this show. 
[00:35:00]  Always something better the next day.  Jimmy's just sitting there with his arms folded.  Are you sad?  Happy?  I'm fine.  You're fine?  Good.  I'll get sick.  All right.  You know what?  I was always...  When they said they were fixing everything, I was like, that's great, and I have total faith that things will get fixed.  But I was very skeptical that you can test things without being on the air.  I feel that is completely impossible and unrealistic. 
[00:35:30]  Well, they kind of told us that, though.  You cannot...  So, you know something?  I think it would have been very clever and almost, you know, entertaining and funny to have a test show.  With tech guys?  Where just tech guys get on and you tune in on channel and you hear, test, test, does this work?  What does this sound like?  Like, what not?  You could do that for a half hour just to see what it sounds like.  You know what?  I was ready to say I'd rather watch Paint Dry, that old gag.  Yeah.  But you know what?  I'm with you on that.  It would kind of be...  I would be tuning into that.  I would tune into the tech guy test show. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Just do it.  Maybe even ten minutes.  And then if they need to fix something, you pop back on a bit, you tinker with it, and then you're back on for ten more minutes.  It's just to test it out because I completely...  I do not feel you can test things unless you're actually on the air doing it.  Because now, look, our levels have to be way up in order for us to even be heard.  Yeah, but they're doing something over here.  What?  Over there?  That screen that I can't see whatsoever?  I don't even know what you're looking at, Ovi.  Ovi's got screens in front of him.  I can't even see them. 
[00:36:30]  Don't worry.  You don't want to see them.  He's looking at levels.  Like you're looking and...  Don't worry.  It just makes me look important.  I have no idea what it does.  I have no clue.  But guests come in and they see these things around me and go, wow, he must be the brains of the operation.  Look at all those things he's responsible for.  It makes people think if they come in here that I had an inkling that they wanted to get into radio.  Yeah.  They go, well, I wanted to.  It seemed easy, but I don't know what that is.  I can't just sit down and do radio. 
[00:37:00]  How many years does it take to figure out that thing?  I don't even know.  What is that?  I have no idea.  It's like a round thing?  I don't know.  Oh, you have something that looks like a boat radar.  That's all I can explain.  It looks like boat radar.  What are you tracking there?  Is there a storm?  Is that a Doppler 5000?  I think there's a cold front moving in, Anthony.  I don't know.  I could, I could, I swear I have no idea.  You know what I do, though?  Every once in a while, I'll look over at it, though. 
[00:37:30]  Look over at it.  I see.  Uh-huh.  Okay, good.  All right.  That thing is good.  Lux capacitor is fluxing.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Because I think they want to work on a few levels.  Well, let me just hear this.  Oh, you sound a lot nicer.  Does it sound better?  I've got to turn you down a little bit.  What happened, Jimmy?  Ho, ho, ho.  Mar, my big debut.  Mar's went down.  I still sound terrible to myself, though.  To yourself?  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Not just sound-wise, but content.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, can you do something about that?  Yeah.  Can you change what comes out of my mouth to be funny?  Yeah, could you install a funny bone as well as fixing the pads on this?  Take out wrenched ankle.  A funny bone.  Yeah, it still sounds weird to me.  Yeah, I need my funny meter changed.  Do you have a funny meter over there?  Obviously not.  That isn't peaking. 
[00:38:30]  The levels are low on the funny meter today.  My levels on my funny meter have been low for a long time.  That's not true.  Could someone fix that for me?  All right.  I'm just talking for a second to hear if it sounds okay.  It still sounds a little bit underwater, no?  People want to know if Don Geronimo was driving that ambulance.  That's very funny.  Okay.  Killer.  All right, we're back in New York City.  It's the Opie to Anthony program.  Murderer.  And we got Louis Black calling in today.  Oh.  He's too lazy to come in. 
[00:39:00]  Old friend Louis Black, I guess he has a new book out, and he'll talk about that today  on the program.  Is he in New York?  Will he be calling from blocks away?  No.  Okay.  Because that wouldn't be...  He would have no excuse for that.  His publicist actually did say when he was promoting his book, he would contact the radio show.  Yeah, and he's promoting his book, and he'll be in.  Cool.  One of the...  But he did call.  Oh, that's...  He called earlier.  Cool.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yes, Ben.  He's coming into...  He will be in the studio in a couple weeks.  He's just on this book tour, and he's flying all over the place and all that.  All right.  Well, that's good. 
[00:39:30]  He is coming in when he's actually in town for a while.  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  I know he's been bouncing all over the place.  Ben, I have a question.  Do you drive?  Yes, I drive.  You have a license?  Not that often.  Yeah, I have a license.  Not that often.  Not that often.  I have a car.  Do you have a car and everything?  I have a car, yeah.  Where do you keep that?  Across the street from my house.  In Manhattan?  Yeah, it's a lot of money.  Are you constantly changing...  Oh, a parking garage, or do you have a parking garage?  No, no, no, no.  That's stupid.  Your car will get broken.  He does that.  I hope he does that.  I don't do that.  Well, sort of, when the car's in the city.  Yeah.  I've seen too many windows.  That whole changing back and forth, alternate side parking crime that they pull on you here 
[00:40:00]  in the city.  Well, I'll get my car back out to Long Island in the next couple days.  I mean, but, yeah, right now, because I drove to Boston, it's in the city, but...  Stop with Long Island, please.  I like the Long Island thing.  Thanks.  Long Island is very nice.  Getting into it, back and forth from the city, is a pain in the ass unless you do it  when it's still dark out.  But Long Island is very pleasant.  How do you guys...  I drove one time out there, and I wanted to...  I just wanted to cut my own throat on the LA.  I hate it out there.  I understand the driving part, but the pleasure of living... 
[00:40:30]  Do you know what a weekend is like out on Long Island?  It's wonderful.  Birds are tweeting.  I look out my window.  Do you know what we got at the house, Opie?  Oh, my God.  We got...  What the hell is happening to you?  I don't even...  A tiny little bird feeder.  And we stuck it on the back window.  And the little cardinals and birds tweet, tweet, and they grab little sunflower seeds. 
[00:41:00]  And you go, ooh, look!  There's a little Tweety bird out the window.  And the squirrels try to get to it, but they can't jump that high.  But gosh darn it, they try.  And they walk up, and sometimes the birds drop some of the little seeds.  And the squirrels come up and eat some of the seeds.  And it's a perfect little suburban day.  You do realize you used to have threesomes, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened. 
[00:41:30]  I don't know what...  I just want to wake you up a little bit.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I'm looking at birds out my back window, Opie.  Could you hear this?  Shoot me.  Shoot me.  You know how that should have went?  There's a little bird outside the window.  Get the bat.  I'm not saying that there aren't other things to do, but it just conjures up.  It's that suburban living on a weekend when you're not commuting into the city or something. 
[00:42:00]  It's very pleasant.  It lowers your blood pressure to watch the birds feed.  You hear the little children playing in another yard somewhere a few houses away.  Maybe a dog barking in the distance.  A little dog barking.  Maybe you hear a couple of the landscapers, you know, doing a lawn down the street.  The smell of cut grass filling the neighborhood.  That's nice.  Not a black person to be seen. 
[00:42:30]  Oh!  Maybe I shouldn't have gone that far.  Teasing, of course.  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  It's suburban living, Opie.  Maybe a little ice cream truck.  Country.  Oh!  The ice cream truck is coming down the street.  And there's the little kids.  Stop!  That's the wonder of suburban living, Opie.  Out far from the city. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, close enough to work.  But on the weekends, you just want to remove yourself from, may I say, the hustle and bustle of city life.  And just sit there.  Maybe I'm sitting on my back deck.  Honey!  Honey, could you get me an ice cold iced tea?  Ah.  And then I kick back and watch the birds.  Watch the children bicycle down the street. 
[00:43:30]  Watch everyone of the same race, creed, and color enjoying country life.  Perhaps you can light up a Lucky Strike cigarette.  It's the wonders of suburban living, Jimmy.  That's why I live out on Long Island.  The commute, sure, that's a bad thing.  But it's the weekends I look forward to.  The sights and smells of wonderful country living.  That's why I do it. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Thank you.  Beaver!  Beaver!  This song does conjure up nice living, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Beaver.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O and A virus.  Wow.  You rule, Bernie.  Bernie.  No, no.  You do.  This one, right?  Yeah, this.  Oh!  Wait!  You motherfucker!  Tony!  Tony!  Tony!  Tony! 
[00:44:30]  Oh, he's coming over there!  Oh, Bernie!  Bernie, sit down!  Sit down!  Oh, my God!  Wait!  He's really mad.  He's mad.  You pissed off Bernie again.  All right, get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.  All right, sit down.  Stand up to your right, Bernie!  Sit down, Bernie!  Sit down!  It's okay!  It's okay!  It's okay, Paul!  It's okay! 
[00:45:00]  It's okay!  Oh, it's okay!  Oh, it's okay!  Oh, it's okay!  All right, have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take it.  Let's see.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Oh!  Oh!  Where did he get that fucking CD?  Oh, yeah!  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you're going to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie.  Bernie.  Oh, he's fine, Paul.  Oh, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Everybody relax.  All he did was take the CD out, I think. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep the CD out.  We'll be here again.  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie's leaving!  Oh, man.  All right, he's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  That was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  He was out of his mind.  You know what, Todd?  We were talking about Rain Man.  And when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was kind of like you're looking at Dustin Hoffman  and go, not too bad. 
[00:46:00]  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport, just like, ah, just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster and a little smoke filled up and he couldn't handle  it.  Right.  Imagine that, O.  You didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just lost.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You better.  Have another. 
[00:46:30]  Take your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  O.  B.  Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Anthony and I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The O.  B.  Anthony Show. 
[00:47:00]  You're going to save yourself and take it out on me.  You're going to save yourself and take it out on me.  Yeah.  Ah, we're back with the O.  B.  Anthony program.  Yes, it's Whip about Wednesday, by the way.  Oh, it is.  It is time to promote the hell out of that.  That old gag.  Right.  We love that old gag, though.  It works nicely.  Especially with the warm weather starting to hit the rest of the country, finally. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Except for Boston.  Ben was telling me that it starts snowing in Boston after we left or something like that.  Of course it did.  And Curt Schilling's pitching tonight, and it's going to be like 32 degrees at the ballpark.  Awful.  Schilling.  And his ankle.  Good.  Have fun.  I was so pissed off at the Yankees.  They stunk up the joint.  Sorry, I'm trying to adjust my arm.  You're still trying to adjust crap?  Yeah.  Well, real fast. 
[00:48:00]  The wow phenomenon.  In a tube.  What are you laughing at over there, Jimmy?  Let me fucking know.  You're reading, uh...  Go ahead, what?  Are you guys...  Oh, and Aaron, Hustler...  What issue is this?  July 2005.  It was just handed to us during the commercial break.  I don't know when this hits newsstands, because we get these ahead of time.  But, yeah, we made Hustler Magazine July 2005.  Big article.  Right on the cover.  It says, holy fuck, Opie and Anthony uncensored.  And, man, did they come in on a good day.  We haven't done a lot of naked chicks on the brand new radio show, believe it or not. 
[00:48:30]  And you would think we would do more, because we're uncensored now completely with this satellite radio thing.  Yeah.  But we've kind of backed off on it, because it's...  I don't know.  It's just...  We just kind of ran out of things to do with the chicks.  But, with that said, Hustler came in the day we had just all-out lesbianism going on.  There is a girl right on our broadcast counter here, just getting eaten out by another chick. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, right there.  I don't even remember doing this.  No.  This was probably, like, the first couple weeks of the show, right?  Yeah.  But what are you laughing at?  You saw a line that...  There's one thing where they're talking about Ant doing Tony Danza.  And it said, Anthony impersonated the talk show.  So convincingly, the fan thought she was actually talking to Danza.  Anthony was trying to pick her up, Obie remarks, laughing, saying,  Hey, you know how I get a little nervous before the show.  Why don't you come back to my dressing room and relieve me?  Then Anthony asked the chick if she took it in the ass. 
[00:49:30]  Subtle.  This isn't like an interview you see in the Daily News or the Post or anything.  Yeah, we're fortunate enough to get to do a lot of interviews.  You're right.  Where else would you see?  Yeah, take it in the ass.  Taylor Law.  This is the day Taylor Law was in here because there's a picture of Ope.  There's a picture of you guys.  There's a hot picture of her and another chick kissing. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Her and another chick having oral sex.  Her licking another chick's breast.  Yep.  And then me hugging her and holding her leg.  It's very...  That's Steve C's smiling face behind those girls?  Yeah.  Yeah, Martini Steve makes her.  Cozy, smiling face.  Because you know he tells everybody at home, I'm not even in the same room when that kind  of stuff goes on.  I have to go in and mix things and work on the editing for the show.  There's a girl tweaking nipples with a smiling Steve head right behind her.  Explain how they superimpose your bare face there, stupid. 
[00:50:30]  He's pretty much making a lesbian sandwich.  I mean...  Yes.  Who are you kidding, man?  Look at that dumb smile on his face.  I was thinking about something else.  How do I make this into a promo?  I was just thinking of what Ramon would have said had he seen this.  Ramon, get the dildo.  Ramon, call Dominic Barber.  He gets really mad when we talk about that. 
[00:51:00]  Yes, he does.  Ben gave me a talking to in Boston that Steve was very pissed off.  A talking to.  Ben goes, you know, Steve's not happy that you said that he stayed home because he's trying  to save his marriage.  I'm like, Jesus.  God, everyone has got to relax around here.  Yeah.  They're just jokes.  What happened to having a sense of humor?  Of course.  All right.  Well, this is cool.  Yeah, it's a great article, man.  I want to read the dirty stuff on the air because we can do that now.  Dirty stuff. 
[00:51:30]  But it's the July 2005 Hustler magazine.  Yeah.  And it looks like they did a pretty good job.  Excellent job.  All right.  They talk about Tony Danza.  They talk about the time John Valby was in here.  They got the whole lesbian thing as the main focus with the pictures.  That's great.  They show us in the studio broadcasting.  Article we can't show anybody.  Huh?  An article we can't show anybody.  Why not?  You taking that home to mom?  Hey, mom.  Check out the Hustler magazine. 
[00:52:00]  They got some of the good Howard stuff in here I see as I scan the article.  Looks like the guy did a pretty good job.  A thorough job.  With the exception of, and comedian Jim Norton dropped in.  Like I said, they did a great job of this article.  I didn't just drop in.  That's a bunch of lies.  A very, very accurate article, I must say.  No.  It's not true at all.  And I don't like the way they always quote an awful line that I do.  It's like, this is the one line they quote from me.  You fucking insane idiot.  Norton screamed at a conspiracy theorist. 
[00:52:30]  Boy, that makes me sound like a really talented comic.  Like I said, a very accurate article.  It's not an accurate article.  I happen to say some clever things sometimes.  I think there's just a little too much Jim Norton exposure in our Hustler article.  I got two mentions.  Two little quotes and a picture.  Please, you don't think that's what I was scanning the article for?  You think I really speed read?  We're all like that, though.  I know, I'm looking for a J or an N.  Every article Anthony and I do, I don't give a crap what Anthony said.  I want to see if I look good in this article. 
[00:53:00]  You've got to count quotes.  And then when Anthony and I get pissed off because then there's something I said that I was quoted to Anthony and vice versa.  They always make that mistake.  In other words, making me funnier.  So you're going to bring this home to mom?  Yeah, my mom is actually very cool with this stuff.  Would she be cool with page 74?  Well, let me take a look at page 74, Anthony.  Let me go to page 74.  Just a few pages away from our article.  All right.  Whoa. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, Hustlers.  There's 31 flavors.  It's 31 pussies through the years from 1974 to 2004.  And they show the changing style of the snatch over 31 years.  1974, they were going without the hair, too, huh?  74?  No, that's red hair.  It's a big red bush.  Look at 1976.  Oh, I thought that was a bruise.  Oh, my God.  76 is just disgusting.  Oh. 
[00:54:00]  Who the hell was into oral sex?  It looks like an alien wearing Ralph Cramden's raccoon hat.  Look at 1989.  It looks like a monkey's face.  Where is that?  89?  Jesus.  Wow.  What kind of monkey is that for the people at home?  Come on, Anthony.  You know a little about everything.  I believe that's a macaque.  A macaque?  I think it's a macaque.  It looks like a monkey's face.  Does it?  88.  It looks like...  You can't even see snatch.  Where's 88? 
[00:54:30]  That looks like...  That's snatch?  That's a hatchet wound to Samuel L. Jackson's head in Pulp Fiction.  Whoever likes hair is an idiot.  Shave it all off.  Look at it.  It's just gross.  What about...  1987 is the famous chew up some hubba-bubba,  and then throw it on a barbershop floor.  Oh, yeah.  What about 1991?  It's gray pubic hair for some reason.  91.  Ooh.  Gray pubic hair was in?  That is weird.  That does have a Dr. Zayas quality to it. 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  There really aren't many attractive ones in this.  1996.  The kid in play look.  Look at 2000.  2001 looks like a fine ebony princess.  Yeah.  Looks like a wallet, sir.  And the Pearsons made their appearance starting in 1999 for you people keeping track at home. 
[00:55:30]  Ooh.  Yeah.  Well, so you think this would be fine to have laying around Mom's house?  Well.  She's thumbing through.  Let's see what kind of fine publication is doing an article on my son.  Ooh.  Well, I mean...  Wow.  Well, right after our article is just a massive lesbian pictorial.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at page 94.  All right.  Look at the little picture on page 94. 
[00:56:00]  I wish everyone could play along at home, but this Hustler's not out yet.  I think it hits the newsstands maybe next week or something.  94?  Yeah.  All right.  You could probably pick up any Hustler and just blurt out page numbers, and believe me,  there'll be something.  Hey, wow.  Look at that.  You see the picture of the girl there with the big black one in her mouth?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be lovely?  I don't think Mom's going to get to page 94.  You don't think?  She might not want to see what type of publication.  I think Mom will see Hustler's 31 Flavors. 
[00:56:30]  I think she'll have to check out the two blondes going at it, because that's right after our  article.  And what's right before our article?  Oh, Nicole Richie naked and Sharon Stone naked.  I think they use cake icing.  Huh?  I think they use, like, strudel icing in these pictures.  We talked to the guy from Penthouse.  Yeah.  They do do something with that.  Yeah, that's not a money shot right there.  That's, um...  All right, well...  Go ahead. 
[00:57:00]  Can I tell you how hot this Jessica James is Hustler's first contract girl?  Wow, is she sexy.  The centerfold?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, real big man in the boat.  Oh.  Oh, I love it.  Yeah, it's too big, bro.  It's not too big.  It's lovely.  I don't get that.  Oh, God.  See, you're like a girl with a schlong.  No, it's just a big clint.  That is too big.  It's not.  No, I don't get that.  That's like her pinky sticking out.  Exactly.  No.  No.  Not good.  No.  Not good.  Anything resembling a male phallus. 
[00:57:30]  No, it's just the more vag, the better.  That looks like a guy.  She's really hot.  The more vag?  All right, we're going to have to scan this article to get the good quotes.  It's got to look nice and self-contained like a chimp mouth.  No.  It should be fat like a chimp's mouth.  Yeah.  But it should just be spilling out all over the place.  Like hanging out of it.  I like one of those Lancelot Link secret chimp shows where it's a chimp mouth, but he's  smoking a cigarette.  Hey, Marta.  Like an overflowing closet. 
[00:58:00]  There's stuff hanging all out of it.  What is that?  Well, this is a nice surprise today.  Hustler, July 2005.  We knew it was coming out soon, but I didn't know we'd get an advance copy today.  Look for that on your newsstand.  Your newsstand?  Can you actually find it on your newsstand?  Yeah, sure you can.  Is it behind the counter?  Nah.  Camouflaged somewhere?  All right.  Where were we?  Because that was a nice distraction.  It was something I saw quickly yesterday as we were driving away from Paradise in Boston. 
[00:58:30]  It was Kermit Guy.  What the hell was his name?  Frank from Jersey.  Frank from Jersey, who didn't know it, but he sounded just like Kermit the Frog.  He was pushing wheelchair Fred down, what road were we on there?  Boston.  I don't know.  What?  Isn't that Commonwealth?  Commonwealth, yeah.  He's pushing Fred, and he's pushing him down the street, and he's holding one of those  huge Opie and Anthony signs.  Right.  And I guess some wind grabbed it, so he kind of let go of Fred for a second to steady the 
[00:59:00]  sign, and the road is crowned in a way where it kind of goes downhill into the gutter,  and Fred made an abrupt right-hand turn and smashed into the curb right as I was driving  away.  I saw this scene unfolding in front of me.  The guy didn't want to lose his Opie and Anthony sign.  He released Fred.  Wow.  He smashed into the curb.  He knows what's more important in his life.  It was the funniest goddamn thing.  A stupid Opie and Anthony poster is more important than a human life to Frank.  Although he did clean up the feces that Fred left in the hotel room, which amazes me, 
[00:59:30]  but that doesn't seem all that right in the head anyway.  Well, that show was very, very tough to do yesterday.  Oh, we were getting some really bad feedback from a whack bag, I know.  A couple of people were.  Oh, that show stunk.  Actually, it wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  I listened on the way home, and it wasn't that bad.  I said if we were in that situation doing that show on a daily basis, I'd jump out the  window.  Oh, we wouldn't have an audience. 
[01:00:00]  We know that.  But there's weird shows like that that are kind of cool if they're a one-off, you know?  You go in that situation and do a show.  It was like an unplugged.  Right.  Because the audience was very involved and very there with the show.  Well, Frank describing how he had to clean up wheelchair Fred's shit was worth the price  of admission there.  In the Kermit voice.  In the Kermit voice.  Yeah.  Listening to the replay.  Oh, my God.  That was really funny.  Heck, I had no clue.  Let me go to the phone and say hi to Greg in Canada. 
[01:00:30]  Listening to us illegally.  Hey, Greg.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey, man.  How did the phone sound?  Actually, it sounds pretty good.  After all, I've bitched and whined it and hoped he's been doing it the last couple of  months.  I'm sure happy to hear that.  Yeah, definitely.  You can hear me.  How's our little underrated comic doing over there since he was neglected?  Jim Norton?  That's the one.  No, Norton's very happy.  He got more exposure in this article than he usually gets. 
[01:01:00]  I'm sure he would like more exposure.  He should get more exposure.  But at least they got his picture in the article and a few quotes.  I don't even do the interviews anymore.  I just kind of play.  It's not necessary.  As long as the show, believe me, the show is doing well, I'm doing well.  Oh, good.  Well, putting you on exposure and scaphological in the same paragraph would be good.  Anyways, you guys were talking about Bushes there.  By the way, sir, I don't like the way you paused.  You refused to pause after you joke bombed.  Don't try that.  Anyways, a little throat clear. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, I'm a truck driver, not a comic.  That's my thing, pal.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead, pal.  Unless I'm turning right or left.  But Doug Stanhope was somewhere a while back, and he was talking about Bushes, as you guys  are talking about, the Hustler dealer.  Yeah.  And he referred to, oh, probably what you figured to 74 was, a bird's nest full of bacon, grease,  and raw meat.  That's the kind of pussy he likes.  Well, you know, sir, maybe Doug should learn to see the value of a human being for a little 
[01:02:00]  more than just their cunt.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  There it is.  Threw out the first one.  The first one to the general audience.  Hey, we've got to get Elo in here.  They'll live.  Or did he leave for his meetings?  We're getting a lot of exposure lately.  Everything is starting to come together.  I've got to tell you, because I'm the first one to bitch and complain and blah, blah,  blah.  But everything seems to be coming together.  The studio is going to be, you know, perfect within the next day or two. 
[01:02:30]  They really worked hard while we were on vacation.  We've got the Hustler interview coming out July 2005.  Very exciting.  We didn't really get to talk about it yesterday, but the New York Post, which everyone picks  up and reads here in New York.  Actually, they read it all over the country, because it's one of those papers that you're in  a hotel in the middle of whatever, name a city.  Oh, Phoenix.  Phoenix.  And you go down to this little stupid store there, and they've got a freaking New York  Post.  It just goes everywhere.  And we were on the back page of the sports section, the last third panel or whatever 
[01:03:00]  of the sports section, with a huge Opie and Anthony XM advertisement.  Then I'm sitting on the bowl, reading my brand new issue of Popular Mechanics magazine, Opie.  And there it was, an ad for XM.  And on the bottom, it says all the shows.  And I noticed Opie and Anthony down there, and in much bigger print than the other shows,  much bigger than usual, and bigger than the Bob Edwards font. 
[01:03:30]  Ah, you're learning, Ilo.  I saw that.  I'm a slow learner.  What can I say?  You're learning.  You're learning.  Yes.  But the ad in the New York Post yesterday was amazing.  Right on the back page, you know, the sports section.  It's pretty much the front, well, it's the back cover, but it's the sports section.  Yeah, but the sad part was that this grossly fat, you know, David Ortiz showing off his  World Series.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  Disgusting.  Yeah, a couple of people commented, nice ad for you guys, right under Ortiz.  Yeah, it was disgusting. 
[01:04:00]  What are you going to do?  As long as you see our names and XM Satellite Radio, that's all we care about.  It's all good.  Hey, Ant, check out the MiFi thing, the cover of the MiFi.  Whoa.  You like that?  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Custom covers?  Yeah, those are new, something we're kind of baiting right now, where you can put decals  on the cover of these MiFis.  You can put one on them?  You can put like a little sticker on the cover and customize them.  I'm going to say it again.  Decal?  Decal.  Decal. 
[01:04:30]  I'm not going to take the bait.  It was decal, but decal.  Isn't that cool?  Can people do this already?  We're talking to a bunch of different companies, but yeah.  Wow, that looks really cool.  So there'll be an L&A.  That'll go on any MiFi?  I knew you were gearing up, Jimmy.  And yeah, you got the Yankee logo and the stitching of a baseball and Major League baseball  logo.  That's really cool.  Oh, but you explain that this is the first portable unit. 
[01:05:00]  Nice hair, Joe.  Great.  Even we got the little USA Today.  Nice.  Very good.  Cranking it up.  Boy, all over the place.  Got to, baby.  I like it.  Baseball's the real deal.  I like it.  This must have been that 2005 stuff we were hearing about.  It's all coming.  It's all still coming.  Yeah.  And then the Daily News yesterday had a huge article on the AOL XM deal.  Yep. 
[01:05:30]  And they mentioned Anthony and I and had our big, stupid pictures.  The same picture.  Our 1998 pictures.  Yeah.  A picture they've been using for the last, I don't know, six or seven years with my stupid  mouth open.  I like that picture.  It seemed like a great idea at the time, but it's the only picture they use in New York  when they're talking bad or good about it.  Well, the AOL thing last night was pretty funny.  They do these huge sessions events and down at Webster Hall, they had Little John and  the East Side Boys and the Ying Yang Twins.  So they brought, so I came down to see this whole thing and I brought, you know, Dr. Love 
[01:06:00]  in there, Lee Abrams down.  So we went down to go check out this.  And I got to tell you, I was wearing a suit, which was a mistake.  Uh-oh.  And it was this entire rap show and I have never felt more white and out of place in  my entire life.  And I'm a 34-year-old guy, so I'm like a young kid.  And it's like, I should be not disconnected in the world, but it was, I'd never been to  a rap show, so it was pretty frightening.  You are a corporate guy with your suit at a rap show.  At a rap show.  And I've got a great photo with Little John.  He's got the, you know, the shark teeth in place. 
[01:06:30]  It's just, he's crazy, so.  You must look really out of place.  What do you think about Einstein in there?  You know, Lee Abrams.  Yeah.  Yeah, but at least he.  Well, Lee kind of has a freakish look, though.  At least he's on some kind of dope or something.  Yeah.  So the rap guys can, like.  He can relate.  They'll look in his eyes and just know he's, you know, one with them.  Of course.  That's right.  But nobody bothered you, though.  They probably figured you were a lawyer or an entertainment rep or something like  that.  That's right.  Because that's what the entertainment reps look like.  A bunch of white guys in suits.  That's true.  That's what I was.  That's why, you know, I'm sticking to that story. 
[01:07:00]  Absolutely.  The new slave master.  Well, I'm glad you're back.  I'm glad you're back.  Yeah, buddy.  Elo, we have you in here because you've got to explain the AOL deal.  Sure.  It's just amazing.  Yeah.  It's proven that we picked the right company.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Well, the fundamentals of this one really are simple, is that you take AOL Radio and  they have this giant portal and they've got 22 million subscribers.  By the way, I listen to the AOL Radio channels all the time.  Yeah, they're great.  I can't get enough.  They're great.  So we're basically marrying our music channels with their music channels and we're 
[01:07:30]  putting the music channels together.  We're putting them on a portal where people can go to AOLmusic.com.  It's going to launch sometime in the mid part of July and people will be able to  subscribe.  There's going to be a free service where they're going to get, you know, 10 to 15 of  the XM music channels for free and some of the AOL music channels for free.  And there's a premium service that's kind of an upsell so that if you're not a full  blown subscriber to AOL, you can get that, but you're also going to get all the XM music  channels as well, too.  And then we're going to take a lot of the AOL content like sessions and some of their  other things that they do and we're going to put that on the XM platform through a lot 
[01:08:00]  of our channels and we're going to take some of our artist's confidentials and we're going  to push it that way.  So it's a real good, which we like to say, the buzzword is synergy.  Synergy.  You like that?  I was telling Anthony recently, AOL has made a huge comeback in my life.  I mean, the broadband stuff they're doing, it's just amazing.  And I'm using it to show prep for the radio program.  I love the, I mean, I use the broadband client all the time.  Yeah, for a while I was done with AOL, I was ready to get rid of the service, but then  the broadband stuff hit and then these radio channels, the radio stations you can listen 
[01:08:30]  to, I'm back in, big time.  Yeah, I don't mean to kill the mood in the room, but while you guys are congratulating  yourselves, Sirius has just run out and signed a deal with Commodore 64.  Every time you buy a computer, Sirius sends you a unit and you have to guess which one weighs  more.  Sirius is a serious unit, though, without a doubt.  So, no, but it's great.  It's, you know, it's a great, I mean, listen, everything that's going on and people were,  you know, there was a lot of things that people were saying about, you know, what are you guys 
[01:09:00]  going to do?  You know, they got, you know, NFL and all this other crap, you know, and we kept saying  the whole time, it's like, just wait until baseball season gets here.  And the only thing that I hear from anybody these days is, you know, they're buying the  radios, they have the MiFis.  We have all of our marketing deals for baseball, by the way, that are in all the stadiums, like  Yankee Stadium and Shea and all these other things.  People are buying the service for baseball.  The AOL thing basically positions us on the online space as, you know, again, you know,  a leadership position, again, from the online music space. 
[01:09:30]  What about, there's something very important as far as the deal goes, especially, you know,  Major League Baseball.  What about getting me Yankee tickets?  I can do that.  Is there a way to get me Yankee tickets?  There's a very easy way.  It's about me.  You do realize we were in Boston for opening day, right?  Someone must have told you something.  I know.  It's been a real tough ticket.  Do you realize that...  I signed some POs that said that you were there, so I knew...  There's a rule.  Do you realize that we sacrificed a good broadcast by staying in Boston an extra day because we  just assumed, stupid us, that we would be going to the game Monday night? 
[01:10:00]  We would be going to the game.  Well, that's the only reason we ended up broadcasting in a club in front of 20 people.  We knew it was going to be a disaster the next day, but it was about Anthony and I getting  tickets to opening day, socks, yikes.  A little selfish of us.  We just assumed.  We'd sacrifice the show.  You know, you've got to call.  You've got to hit the ELO on the phone.  You've got to call him.  Let's be honest.  We're your top stars.  You've got Major League Baseball.  To me, it was a no-brainer.  I call it a no-brainer.  Who makes you feel any better?  Bob Edwards didn't get tickets.  I was going to say.  I was watching the game and saw him catch a foul ball. 
[01:10:30]  It was right there.  They didn't need to give him tickets.  They just put him in Shea Stadium in the cart.  They said, all right, just drive around the field.  Do you realize that after Monday's great broadcast, we all went back to our hotel rooms  and were very lonely the rest of the night, just eating food?  I don't buy the fact that Norton was lonely the rest of the night.  No, I spent a little bit of money.  Yeah, shocking.  Well, we have to wait for Ben.  Ben's the most unconnected man in Boston.  The most unconnected, connected guy.  He's unbelievable.  He knows everybody in Boston, according to him.  Well, apparently not anybody at any restaurant. 
[01:11:00]  We learned that.  We walked into a restaurant that I think he owns.  Ben said he owns this place.  I don't know.  So we go in there.  They kind of look around like, well, we're kind of in between lunch and dinner.  And they hand us a pamphlet with some food written on it.  It was like, well, this is what we can give you.  He's like, no, thank you.  We're leaving.  It's the in-between menu.  How about the call from Ben going, give these guys whatever they want.  Open the kitchen for them.  There's a little table in the back.  But that happens in New York all the time, too. 
[01:11:30]  It's the in-between menu.  Yeah, but it's the stupidest thing.  If you know somebody, they'll hook you up.  Right.  Believe me, the food's still back there in the kitchen.  The ovens are all on.  They can make something.  I'm just still surprised that we jumped in that van after the show.  Oh, a fan of the show.  Well, how do we know?  He was driving a big van.  It was like a big airport van that you take.  Well, we didn't even question it.  Hey, guys, I'm a fan of the show.  We all just jumped in.  What was he going to do, rape us each individually?  I don't know.  While we wait and go, oh, my God, am I next? 
[01:12:00]  He's the guy, you know, he's pretty powerless to do anything.  Either that or walk back to the hotel because you get the special treatment from XM.  Oh, another thing, right, the vehicles.  For some reason, no rides were really set up for us.  We didn't have any rides set up.  We had a horse and a buggy set up.  Was that it?  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  That would have been a plus.  Instead, we have to hop in with Stavros, the child rapist, driving us around in a van,  500 pounds, just sweating and glancing in the rearview mirror.  And then he took the long way around.  He took the long way so he could hang with us. 
[01:12:30]  Just to hang out with us longer.  It's got to make you feel loved, though.  Because Anthony and I know Boston relatively well.  Why is he going this way?  Why is he going all the way around?  He wants to hang out longer.  He wants to tell his friends, yeah, no, they were in there for quite a while.  Well, you know what's funny?  I was just, you brought up the AOL thing.  Remember when I was here about three weeks ago, and I came up here, and Hugo was here,  and we were all here, and you guys kept saying, something's happening.  Oh, well, is that the deal?  I've got to come clean.  See, they never fess up when it's going down like that. 
[01:13:00]  Well, you know what?  You've got to buy stock today, because I figured something else out.  Why?  Well, I saw him at 6 o'clock, and I'm like, oh, you all came back because it's our first  day back from vacation.  We've got the studio that's been tweaked for the last two and a half weeks.  That's why I'm here.  He really cares about Opie and Anthony.  He's in town to make another big deal.  Another deal?  You think Lee Abrams would be here to hang with us?  Lee, what are you doing here?  Hanging with you.  Yeah.  All right, there's something going on.  So there's another something going on.  There's always something going on.  Get online, Anthony.  Buy me some shares right now. 
[01:13:30]  Get on E-Trade right now.  And he makes believe he's really here for us.  I saw right through it.  I am here for you.  Ask Wiki.  I told Wiki, I said, I'll be here.  Don't tell him.  I want to surprise him.  It's the first day back in the studio.  Yeah.  We're off of the premium tier.  We're on the basic.  The whole world can hear.  It's 3.7 million people have a chance to hear the virus now.  So it's a beautiful thing.  I'm not usually late on a daily basis to see the boss here.  I was going to...  You know what?  The boss shows up, and I'm late.  I saw you walk in, and I was going to say hi.  I went, ooh, no.  He's actually late every day. 
[01:14:00]  I'm the responsible one.  I'm so glad you finally got to see it for yourself.  I saw it with my own two eyes.  Isn't that great?  The boss is here one day, and it's the day I'm completely late.  I'm strolling in as our opening music is playing.  And I'm deep in preparing for the show.  I've got newspapers all around me.  I've been here for hours.  Hope's got his shoes off.  Norton's barking out orders.  I'm like, well, this is not what I thought happened at 6 a.m.  I'm strolling in.  Anthony strolls in as Ecstasy of Gold is playing.  It's finishing.  Yeah, finishing.  I'm like, thank God you finally noticed who's really in charge here, Elo. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, that looked really bad for me right there.  It's all good.  And the AOL thing, are they going to be able to hear Anthony and I?  You know, that's one of the things we're working on today.  There's meetings today.  Oh!  There's meetings today.  That means no.  No, no, no.  It doesn't mean no at all.  They're petrified of us.  No.  No, trust me.  If we're petrified of you.  Not you guys.  No, no, no.  AOL.  It's more of a music deal and it's really focused on the music portal.  But all of our streaming and all of our radio online stuff that we have with the O&A online  and everything else is still there. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  It's all good.  All right.  It's a beautiful thing, guys.  It's a beautiful thing.  And I'm glad to see the studios in tip-top shape.  It's getting there.  Yeah, it is.  I must say I'm happier with the headphone situation.  You sound great to me now.  Yeah.  You see our Hustler interview?  Yeah, how about that, huh?  Is the company very proud of this one?  I am.  I can't wait to take it back.  I especially love the two girls on the table.  That was nice.  Yeah, that's a good one, huh?  Yeah, this is really going to help Hugo.  Yeah.  This is really going to help Hugo's impression of us as he tries to sell us to the stockholders. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, it's like this is a show that's going toward the future.  This is a pop culture show.  You know how many times I've told Hugh Pinero personally that we're trying to get away from  the naked chicks?  They're staring away from that kind of thing.  And the shocking stuff.  And the only picture they got in our Hustler interview is one girl eating out another girl.  But it's Hustler.  You've got to tell.  But I love the face that you have watching the two girls eat each other out in the back.  Oh, no.  That's Martini Steve.  Oh, Steve.  Yeah.  Yep, that's Steve.  Oh, that's Steve.  And then, of course, you've got Norton's photo over on the right, which is really nice. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, then we've got Stupid Bob Kelly in this other photo.  I didn't notice that.  You've got him in that one?  Yeah.  Oh, is that him, that unshaven idiot?  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, yeah, he is in the back, just lurking and looking.  There's another one who's got some explaining to do when he gets home.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm never in studio when that stuff happens.  Yeah, look at you, stupid.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, right.  Ready to do a colonoscopy.  He's in print.  Hey, Lee, it was nice talking to you, by the way.  Hey, great job, Lee.  Hey, do you need to bring the show?  Lee, just sitting there nodding off.  No.  That's good.  No.  I'm enjoying every minute of it. 
[01:16:30]  Lee, I want you to be very honest.  Yes.  I'm going to put you on the spot here.  How annoying was Jim Norton, as far as Robert Plant picture goes?  Don't hold back.  Because I guarantee you...  You know, with respect to his tenacity in acquiring a photograph...  Tenacity.  It was unbelievable.  I've never seen anything like it.  Probably...  Well, it was back in the late 60s.  Someone really, really wanted to meet Hendrix.  I think it was 67. 
[01:17:00]  That's comparable, right?  That was comparable.  But since then, nothing like Jimmy trying to get this picture of Robert Plant.  It was absolutely unbelievable.  The vicious tenacity, the intensity...  That sounds better than just calling him a nudge.  I was a nudge.  I'll admit that.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  But the photo is scary.  You've seen it.  Oh, it's horrible.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's classic.  I've got it on my trio right now.  The little smiling faces.  His little lock over my face.  Yeah, the hair is touching your face.  The little men just smiling.  His head is as big as a pumpkin. 
[01:17:30]  It really is awful.  I've never seen a bigger head in my life.  But you have to do it that way to get Robert Plant.  You have to do it that way.  Lee even said he's a tough one.  His people are very protective.  He's a very tough one to get.  You have to...  But Lee's a very important man, and he had a lot to do that day.  I would just pop in and ask him.  You didn't care about everything else he needed to take care of that day.  I do want you to know, just went in there and said, look, I know we've got a performance  here, and this is a big deal.  Robert's a rock god.  We've got to do this Norton thing.  Or the deal's off.  Or the deal is off.  We came so close to the whole show being scrubbed. 
[01:18:00]  Very upset.  Robert Plant leaving his band, sulking, moving away.  Management and label freaking out because of Norton.  So at the last minute, Robert said, well, we've got to do this.  And he agreed.  The picture was taken.  It looks great.  And I understand Paul McCartney is stopping in at one point, possibly.  Well, you know, it's interesting.  We're talking to the McCartney people, and one of the conditions is a photo with you.  Right.  And you bet I'll be there for that one.  Okay.  You know, that's actually critical to any... 
[01:18:30]  All the artists are coming to us now that we're big and popular and getting bigger all  the time.  And it's interesting how the Norton factor is a key ingredient in all the negotiations.  I hear Jimmy is demanding that they find a crosswalk.  To take the McCartney picture.  Is that true?  And you're making him take his shoes off.  And he said he would do it for you.  I don't want to be a pain in the ass, but Paul, take your shoes off.  Walk with me out to this crosswalk.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Wonderful.  As a matter of fact, I understand they might watch you on the cover of the next Plant record.  Oh.  Be happy to be a part of that.  Nude crawling on rocks.  I can see the photoshopping as we speak on Wackbag.com.  For the new listeners, there's a great message board.  It's Wackbag.com.  They've got a photoshop section that's just classic every day.  They just take what they hear on the show here and photoshop it.  Sure. 
[01:19:30]  That's a little visual.  I love it.  It's pretty funny.  All right.  So what's the next big deal?  There's really nothing in the works.  Come on.  Give us a little something-something.  There's nothing in the works.  There's always something in the works.  There's always something in the works.  But he's good.  Well, it's the Norton Plant thing.  Yeah.  I mean, there's that.  We know that.  Obvious marriage.  All right.  No, it's...  But, you know, the...  The all right, man.  All right.  Yeah, right.  It's all right.  It's good.  It's good.  All right.  What is the Ope usually says?  Oh, we're going to let you be.  Yeah, let you be.  We're going to let you be.  I'm sure you're pretty busy, guys.  This is another Ope classic. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, so they're saying we've got to get you out of here.  It's like nobody leaned in and said anything to you.  When are they saying this?  Pipe it into your headphones?  Look, we know you'd love to talk, but we've got to get them out of here.  It's written on that screen he looks at.  I know.  I love when he does that to someone I've brought into the show.  He's like, well, they're saying we've got to let you out of here.  And the guy's like, ooh.  You know, there's so many things.  I'm with Greg Charles.  The problem you have is that Lee and I are doing so many things, we forget who's in the loop.  So you just get outside of when it's not like Lee and I, we just don't talk to people.  We just like walking down.  Even at XM, we don't even speak to people. 
[01:20:30]  It's like, what's going on?  I want to play you guys something.  You know what?  Incidentally, I think we have an NDA on this, but I don't know.  We are looking at acquiring Cleveland, though.  That could be good.  But, you know, you've got to keep that quiet.  You know, on vacation, I was debating if I should start smoking pot again.  I'll get into it later.  I was really debating.  Why not?  You were in the perfect atmosphere.  Yeah, I was in the Bahamas.  I haven't smoked pot in probably a decade. 
[01:21:00]  But I was debating.  I think I might go back to smoking pot.  And now after talking to Lee, I'm there.  I'm there.  It's all a case of glaucoma.  It's all legal and everything.  I'm there.  Or you could have been at the Little John show last night, like Lee and I were.  There was plenty of that there.  I felt so white.  Did you?  Yeah.  Well, you are.  And you should be grateful.  Well, you felt out of place one night.  Who cares?  Yeah, really.  Now I know how those old folks felt at that 69 Pink Floyd show. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, you were there as a kid.  Yeah, I was.  And there's some old people there.  And look at those old people.  I went to a Who show a couple of years back.  And it was just like, wow.  Because I remember going to see The Who in high school.  And, you know, it was really rocking.  And the crowd jumping around like maniacs.  And then you go now and it's just, oh, my God.  So many skullets.  Yeah.  You get the skull mullet going.  And just these guys that broke out the jean jacket with the Who album cover painted on the back. 
[01:22:00]  And there are big guts hanging out of the front of it.  Did you see Adultery?  I think it was on one of those VH1 type channels.  He will reunite The Who as long as he gets Norton involved.  Oh, yeah.  He's got to be.  Norton must be involved in some way.  I'm not a big Who fan, to be very honest.  No, he's not.  No, that's the problem.  Very overrated.  Now, you cannot be a Who fan, but to say they're overrated is ridiculous.  I thought they were.  They were one of the hugest fans.  They were.  They were. 
[01:22:30]  Who's next one of the greatest albums ever made?  The Who sellout.  One of those gems.  You ever listen to that one?  No.  See, most people haven't.  Tommy the Rock Opera.  You know, it's a little different.  Listen to The Who sellout.  Great.  Come on.  All right.  For all the new listeners, the only reason he's saying this is because it doesn't involve  Ozzy Osbourne.  That's not true.  His hero and lover.  I happen to, I put myself up to a lot of new music. 
[01:23:00]  I'm more verity than you think.  I love Bob Marley.  I love Sabbath.  I love a lot of weird things.  Johnny Cash.  But I just think The Who was probably already.  One other person before he brought up something with Ozzy.  Bob Marley.  Oh, Sabbath.  Did I mention Ozzy?  Johnny Cash.  If I didn't say that, they would have done it.  Any alive guys you like?  What's that?  Any living guys you like?  Not many, no.  I mean, I just think The Who was already.  Any living people?  What's some of the other big songs that they did?  I mean, I know they had some, who are you?  No, no.  That's cheesy.  Who are you?  No, no, no. 
[01:23:30]  Yuck.  I can see for miles.  What about the Magic Boss?  My generation.  Call me lightning.  My generation was an all right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You're not...  Well...  They're a good band.  I'm not saying they're a bad band.  A good band.  All the who are bands.  He's putting them in the same category as, like, Strawberry Alarm Clock.  No, no, no.  Look, I don't...  Those guys rock.  Did you ever hear the true story about the Strawberry Alarm Clock?  Of course.  He's got a Strawberry Alarm Clock story. 
[01:24:00]  No, this is true.  Okay, they came out in 67, 68, when, you know, bands like The Who and Jethro Tull and Zeppelin  and all of them were emerging.  And the management of the Strawberry Alarm Clock felt that they weren't being taken seriously.  Yeah, of course.  They were kind of a pop band, but they really wanted to be hip, underground, acid rock, and  all that.  So the manager planted pot in their amplifiers, called the police in Champaign, Illinois, had  them busted, figuring that it would be this huge headline, the Strawberry Alarm Clock  are druggies, and it would be great for their credibility. 
[01:24:30]  Obviously, it didn't work.  Oh, it didn't get the press that they needed?  No.  They ended up fighting.  They did get arrested, though?  They did get arrested, and they broke up.  They got arrested, and no one cared.  Actually, an incense and peppermint.  You know, I think this is true.  The real singer was so out of it that they had to get some other guy to sing the song.  He's not the real Strawberry Alarm Clock singer.  So if you listen to Tomorrow...  Singing on the record?  Yeah.  The only hit they had, someone else sang?  Uh-huh.  Of course, they did have Tomorrow, and sit with the guru, which we're... 
[01:25:00]  You are good, man.  Relaxing is everything.  Deep track and Strawberry Alarm Clock.  Wow.  I want to wind him up.  I want to listen to deep track so bad, but I...  Wow.  You go so deep.  Oh, my God.  That's why we have top tracks for all your favorites.  I understand.  If you go back to your comment about doing pot again, then you go to deep tracks.  That's true.  Smoke the pot, go to deep tracks.  You'll be like, why are they going so shallow?  If it's really good pot, you go to fine-tuning.  Fine-tuning?  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  It's only for the quality, but...  Programming for pot.  That's great.  Well, duh.  Look at that.  Smoke a little.  Yeah, this is good stuff.  There's a whole marketing angle here I didn't even think of.  I've only smoked once under the supervision of a doctor.  Yeah.  That's great.  Okay.  Well, that must have been some pot because it's still hitting you.  That's good stuff, Max.  He's had refills for 20 years.  Very good.  Well, gentlemen, we're getting a sign from outside that you have to go.  Well, I want to play him something.  Well, where do you have to go?  Where are we going? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Who's telling Eric Lowe that he's got to go?  He's the boss.  Oh, E. Lowe has things to do.  I want to play him something, though.  I hear it.  We were talking about marketing and commercials for the Opie and Anthony show and XM Satellite Radio,  and I found a little something for everybody.  Yeah.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along for the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop, unsigned bands, blues, jazz. 
[01:26:30]  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news, sports, talk, and comedy.  All in digital quality sound for less than $10 a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  The XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio.  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard.  Plus, for a limited time, you'll also get a free home kit so you can connect XM to any home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out. 
[01:27:00]  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, I love it.  Thank you, Howard.  Wow.  That's beautiful.  Isn't that Mark St. John from K101?  That is beautiful.  That's great.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  That is priceless.  And it's not even you.  It's not even you, Ian.  No, that is... 
[01:27:30]  That is the voice of Howie.  That is classic.  He knows it's the better...  Absolutely.  He knows it's the better service.  He just didn't want to come here because of Ant and I, and now he's going to suffer because  of it.  Oh, he has no idea.  He has no clue what he has signed up for.  I can't begin to tell you the number of people who have tried to do deals or done things with  them who have picked up the phone and called us and said, how in the world are they going  to catch up?  I mean, they just, you know, there's just no way.  And, you know, when you go from the base that we have and you look at where he's going, the 
[01:28:00]  anxiety is starting to go up with each passing day.  Well, it's going to be a tough ride over there.  Yeah, screw them.  Is Hyundai a big car?  Is Hyundai a big car?  Yes, it's a huge car.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  No, it's great.  And the thing about the Hyundai deal is that it's standard, you know, it's going to be in  every Hyundai is standard equipment, which is a huge... the first time that any of our  automotive partners have done that, so...  It's like an infomercial.  It is.  Hey, what, he just winded me up, you know, I just know I got the talking points. 
[01:28:30]  If you call within the next 10 minutes, Elo will send you a Shemplig.  I've got some Yankee tickets I'll give away, so...  Oh, there you go.  I also need Mets tickets.  Mets tickets, too?  Yeah, they're right by my house.  Why would you go to see the Mets?  It's a short drive.  I like the Mets.  They're like the cute, younger, retarded, younger brother.  I was going to say, it's like the Yankees with Down syndrome.  Yeah, it is.  It pretty much is.  You go there and you're like, aw, they're trying.  It's like a T-ball team.  Yeah, T-ball.  When they tee up the ball and...  I go to Shea Stadium and it just disgusts me. 
[01:29:00]  Really?  I hate it.  It's the worst stadium.  It's the worst stadium in the world.  I mean, I'd rather go to the...  You know, I'd rather go to see the Devil Rays play in a concrete muffin in St. Petersburg  with four people than go sit in Shea Stadium.  Really?  It's horrible.  I hate it.  I don't know.  Wow.  Don't like the Mets.  Don't like...  First of all, Pedro's there and I still can't get over that.  Yeah.  You know, he and the fro.  You had a little problem they had.  They had to postpone the game for a little while because they have, I guess, one of those big video  billboards at Shea Stadium.  And it's usually black when the batters are up, so it's not distracting them. 
[01:29:30]  And they had a big picture of Pedro up there and they couldn't get it off.  And they had to postpone the game until they could do that.  And I guess Pedro was having a good time in the dugout with that and the fans were having  a good time with it.  But he's a great addition to the team, I think.  Yeah, sure.  Although I do like Willie, so...  But how about those Chicago Whitesides?  Oh, please.  First place.  Another awful stadium.  Oh, the old Canisbury.  Yes, the old stadium.  That's awful.  Lee has so many stories.  Oh, my God.  Forget about it.  You know, that's the biggest old Canisbury disco demolition.  I was going to say, disco demolition. 
[01:30:00]  And Steve Dahl.  Yeah.  Legendary.  One of the great moments in broadcasting and baseball.  That is what not to do at a promotion.  Yep.  Oh, that's great.  One of the classic what not to do.  What did he do?  He started a riot.  Oh, my God.  I've heard it, but I don't remember it.  Lee was like the architect of this thing.  Oh, wait.  You were part of that deal?  Oh, God, yeah.  Did you not know that?  I had no clue.  This is a guy who, the background behind, everybody gives Steve Dahl the credit.  It was Lee's deal.  It started with, Steve, I got an idea.  It was one of the most remarkable events in broadcasting history. 
[01:30:30]  In a nutshell, the anti-disco movement was in full force back then.  And the radio station at the time decided as a strategy, we're going to take the anti-disco stand.  And on the air, Steve Dahl would blow up disco records every morning.  And then, to make a long story short, worked a deal with the Chicago White Sox.  And everybody brought a disco record and 98 cents and got into his double, finite doubleheader with the Tigers. 
[01:31:00]  And there were like 60,000 people inside, 60,000 outside, all just like nickel, beer, night, rock and roll, earth dogs, all there.  Listen to the who, you know.  Hey, a lot of who, a lot of who records.  A lot of who records.  Eight tracks.  There was no interest in the game.  And anyway, so between games, all of the records that were collected were carried out into center field, piled up in this huge stack. 
[01:31:30]  It was a huge pile.  I've seen the video.  Oh, it was massive.  Yeah.  And the Army Corps of Engineers, demolition experts who were brought in for this.  How do you get away with this?  Listen, the Sox needed anything to get across.  And they wound the whole pile with the explosives.  And on comes from the bullpen Steve Dahl with this babe.  You know, a lot of stations had chickens for mascots.  This station had a girl.  Easy.  And it was, at the time, it was very effective. 
[01:32:00]  Anyway, they come out in the Jeep with a loop flag, which is a station, which has gone downhill since then, but it was great then.  And a Chicago, a city of Chicago flag, a White Sox flag, and an American flag.  And it was just all, everybody in the military came out.  And Dahl goes on with a huge, you know, PA system.  You know, attention, attention.  You know, welcome.  And they counted down from 10, 9, and it's on the scoreboard.  10, 9, 8, 3, 2, 1, boom. 
[01:32:30]  And this mushroom cloud of disco records.  And then the crowd was smashed by this time.  Just goes out.  It was a complete riot.  It was like Beirut.  It was unbelievable.  They just stormed the field, right?  Stormfield took over everything, stole bases, and it was just unbelievable.  It was so bad.  They canceled the second game.  And then for the next week, it was great.  You know, just all these, you know, one guy from the White Sox was saying, how could they do this to my music? 
[01:33:00]  You know, some guy from the Dominican Republic was very upset about it.  Then other guys from the same team, you know, about the time somebody did this.  There were these point-counterpoint shows on all the news programs, you know.  Is radio going too far?  Well, Steve Dahl had a great line when he was Bill Veck, who owned the team at the time, said, you know, how could you do this to baseball?  I said, Bill, you haven't had 60,000 people in that stadium since you won the series in 59.  But it was unbelievable.  Then, for the next several weeks, the station would get these boxes. 
[01:33:30]  You'd open the box, be a big boom box, smashed to shreds with a letter,  Dear Steve, found some asshole listening to disco, kicked the shit out of him, here's the result.  Oh, God.  It was getting a little out of hand.  And then there were these anti-disco rallies where they'd take it to different clubs,  and you'd start in a location, and, you know, it'd be broadcast, join us.  It'd be like 6,000 cars going to parking lots of discos, blowing up records.  It was unbelievable.  And the ratings went from a .9 to a .73, number one. 
[01:34:00]  And it looked at the rating diaries, you know, when people fill in the rating books, they have comments.  And it was just, you know, disco sucks and long-lived Steve Dahl.  And so, really, it was a statement.  But I really hated, I mean, I remember growing up, the whole disco thing was just, oh, you couldn't hate a music more.  It was 180 degrees.  Rock and roll represented long hair.  Disco was short hair.  Rock and roll was sweaty, you know, overalls.  Disco was, you've got to look good. 
[01:34:30]  Rock and roll was going to festival seating, you know.  But disco was, oh, wait, you don't look good enough.  You can't get in.  Rock and roll was all about sweating drummers.  Disco was drum machines.  Rock and roll was guitars.  It was just 180 degrees.  It was like, you know, the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  It was just, you know, they would never come together.  There's an analogy I've not heard of.  I know.  Disco, Israeli, Palestinian.  I'd never think you'd hear that in a sentence, would you?  And it really did suck.  It did suck, indeed. 
[01:35:00]  So Steve Dahl was, like, really popular back then.  He was huge, yeah.  He was, you know, he was, like, yeah, massive.  Yeah.  Rumor has it Howard stole a lot of his stuff.  Yeah, it's possible, yeah.  Supposedly Steve Dahl was doing a lesbian thing way before Howard and all sorts of things.  He originated all that stuff.  It's funny.  I mean, the problem with Steve Dahl, he just didn't do it that well.  Or he would have been a lot bigger.  Well, I think he sidetracked.  Huh?  Sidetracked.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That was the problem with him? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, because he was a very creative radio guy that did a lot of this stuff way before Howard.  And then Howard, of course, you know, claiming that he invented everything.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  I don't know.  But there's a lot of people that have come forward over the years and said that Howard, you know,  was getting tapes of Steve Dahl's show in Chicago and reinventing himself through what Steve  Dahl was doing in Chicago.  Steve Dahl, we hired him at W4 in Detroit.  He was hugely successful.  Then he went to Chicago.  And Steve's replacement at W4, actually, we brought in Howard Stern. 
[01:36:00]  So Howard actually replaced Steve and was told, hey, you know, the Steve Dahl guy is doing  a certain style.  Can you do this?  And he did a pretty good job.  What years was Steve Dahl popular in Chicago?  79, 80 was, you know, the real peak.  He's still there.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  He met him a couple years ago.  He had a two-year peak?  No, no.  He's still there.  That was just like the super years.  He's still there.  He's a great guy.  Yeah, but it was a slow down slide ever since then.  Wow.  I thought you were going to say, well, from 79 through 90, you know, he was pretty good. 
[01:36:30]  Two years of the week, and then 79 to 80.  I mean, those are the hot days.  Two years of the rollercoaster going, and then it's just the rest of the ride.  Yeah, Howard doesn't like telling those stories, but they're out there.  And, yeah, Steve Dahl was doing a lot of that stuff way before Howard.  Do you know how many bad two-man morning shows with a giggling newswoman there are out there?  Any idea?  Quite a few.  It's unbelievable.  We had a few of them on our very show. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, we actually had our listeners put their phone to the radio and had quite a few of them on the show.  Yeah, they just play a lot of air chicks.  You know, maybe we'll do that bit later this week.  I love that one.  Yeah, we'll do that bit later this week.  Can I say, every road gig I've done where you've got to do radio, and they have those zoo crews,  and that chick, every time, the chick ruins the vibe.  Yeah.  She's the one who puts the moral brakes on, whoa, hey, come on now.  It's just like you've just got to ruin everything.  And people say it's a good thing. 
[01:37:30]  It keeps the guys in check.  It keeps you in check.  It's a balance.  Well, Lee's been a consultant for many, many years.  Lee, you know, they've been trying to get a chick on our program for years.  Not XM, obviously, but over the years, it's been suggested to us that it would be good to have some kind of a female perspective on the show.  You know, in DC at XM headquarters, we have a cliché buzzer.  Yeah.  That would break the buzzer.  Broke the buzzer.  Yeah, that is definitely a cliché.  Anthony and I look at this radio show, it's kind of like a fantasy world, you know, and guys get to peek into this. 
[01:38:00]  So if there's girls on this show, we want them doing, you know, slutty things.  Or as Elo says, a cliché.  A cliché.  I'm all for having a woman come on and do something regularly, as long as she does it with that bat.  That's all I care about it.  Read the news all you want, stupid, but do it with that there.  We have a big star on hold.  He's been waiting for like 20 minutes.  Yeah, these guys really do have to go.  I'm out of here.  Oh, who is it?  Louis Black.  Oh, he played at our millionth sub subscriber thing in DC. 
[01:38:30]  He was unbelievable.  He is so good.  Love Louis.  Thanks for bringing back your bad memory.  I had XM back then, and I'm driving through the middle of Florida listening to you guys have such a great time.  Well, here we are.  All depressed.  Yeah, because we were still a good year away from signing with XM at that point.  We were unemployable.  Yep, yep.  So it's Lee Abrams, everyone, and Elo, of course.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Well, we've got to take a break now, so someone's got to talk to Louis and calm him down.  That'll be fun. 
[01:39:00]  Good luck.  Okay.  Guys, we're here.  What?  I'm here.  Don't take a break, Ben, screaming and yelling?  You've got to take him now.  Maybe he's in the airport or something.  Look at Ben, freaking out.  What?  He's always short on time.  He's always freaking out.  Ben's saying, pick him up.  I don't know if that's what he's saying.  Ben?  Ben, what are you saying?  You are freaking out.  Look, he is losing his mind.  He's ready to throw the phone out the window.  Losing his mind.  What does that mean when he's making the sign, pick up the phone?  He's pissed.  All right, why don't you guys stay in for our Louis Black interview? 
[01:39:30]  Where's my coffee?  Louis!  Louis!  Yeah, the reason we had that big party was just to taunt you.  I called up.  I said, you know, let's just fake this thing and pretend like we're having a great time  because I know that he'll be wandering around in his car and you're really upset.  Depressed.  You don't give a crap about me, Louis.  Where are you, Louis?  I'm in a studio somewhere here in New York.  Oh, in New York.  Oh, he is in New York. 
[01:40:00]  You son of a bitch.  You couldn't stop by.  Guys, guys, let's not even talk about this, okay?  This is good.  I am in...  Shut up!  I'm in book prison, got it?  Book prison.  I'm in book prison.  My life is not my own, okay?  You know the deal.  Hello?  We know the deal.  We are one of many radio shows you will be talking to from this room today.  Now we're just one of many, Louis?  This is what happened between the time that we used to do a show and the new show.  Oh, for Christ.  Louis got too big for us. 
[01:40:30]  Remember when we were like the only show Louis did?  Look, if it was up to me, you'd be the show.  I'm in book prison.  Louis, this was the only radio show you used to do.  Oh, I did others.  I snuck around.  I snuck around.  You cheated on us.  I did.  I went from morning zoo to morning zoo.  Well, now he is getting a little big these days.  I see him.  Yeah, well, I'd rather remain in obscurity. 
[01:41:00]  Louis, I think we need to get you arrested again.  Your head's getting a little too big, I think.  Oh, yeah.  My head is really massive.  Now you're selling your book.  That's it.  I'm whoring, you idiot.  Got it?  It's called Slut Time.  Tell us about your book, Louis.  No, I'm not going to tell you.  I want to hear what the book is about.  I'm not going to tell you anything.  I really don't want to hear about it.  I know you don't want to hear about it.  I don't know what it's about.  I don't care less about your stomach. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, you won't give it a read?  No, it's about my time with Norton.  It's called Me and Jim and our time together in jail, and then I turn it into a larger fantasy  where we go on and create a prison break.  Do you talk about the jail thing or no?  No, that comes in the next book.  Oh, nice.  I won't be writing, and the only reason I'm not going to write is so that I don't take this abuse from you badly.  Abuse?  We're the ones sitting here in a studio without Louis Black sitting in front of us.  Oh, yeah, what a treat that is. 
[01:42:00]  What's the book about?  It's about how I ended up with my twisted point of view.  Oh, there you go.  So it's kind of like you growing up.  Yeah, it's a memoir, only I don't have a memory.  It's getting very good reviews, Louis.  And I've got to tell you, I was in Boston, but you've gotten so big.  You were in Boston, we were in Boston.  I wanted to see you at the Orpheum Theater, but you know what?  You have so many people in between me and you now, I couldn't even get a hold of you to get a ticket.  Oh, you are so full of shit.  The level of, when the shit pours out of your ears, I can smell it from here. 
[01:42:30]  Louis enjoying this satellite radio with this curse freedom.  Oh, yeah, well, you know, hello, I've waited all my life for it, you know, that's all.  You must be enjoying the success and probably the financial reward that goes with it.  Are you donating your money to a lot of your socialist causes, Louis?  I certainly am.  I'm actually giving money to Lebanon.  Lebanon?  Very good, I know.  Well, Yemen, that was the place. 
[01:43:00]  Yemen, yes.  Yemen, that was it.  Well, I screwed that up.  I was always right about Yemen, by the way.  You were right about Yemen.  You laughed at me, and I was right.  Nope, you nailed most of it.  You practically nailed everything.  I don't know why you're not in charge of foreign policy.  They should put me in charge.  What do you mean?  Are you serious you couldn't get into that show?  That's bullshit.  I couldn't figure out how to get a hold of you, Louis.  I asked, they said you were coming to town on Monday, and they said, if they said you  were coming in on Monday, I said, well, I won't be here, and I didn't know you guys 
[01:43:30]  would be up there over the weekend.  I came in early.  Are you going to play a New York show?  I'm not kidding.  I really want to see this.  I'm going to be playing Alice Tully Hall.  I'll get you a ticket.  All right, right on.  I'll be at that show, then.  No, I will.  I'll put it aside.  It's next Saturday.  Next Friday.  Friday.  Next Friday.  I will definitely be there, Louis.  And I'll get some for Anthony, too, but unless there's gambling, he doesn't like to watch  me.  Yeah, Louis, Anthony doesn't really leave the house anymore.  He's changed.  No, I came to see Louis.  Where was that? 
[01:44:00]  Mohegan?  Mohegan's son.  Yeah, Mohegan's son, but I spoke a couple of minutes and then had to run off to the blackjack  table.  Yeah, he was gone.  I was out of there in two seconds.  Thanks for the show, Louis.  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  I've got to go make some money.  Way to keep in touch with old friends, Anthony.  At least I saw him.  I saw he was going to be there.  I called up his room, asked for a free ticket, which he got for me, and went to play some  blackjack.  Are you calling from a green room right now, Louis?  I don't know what it is.  Are you doing a satellite thing? 
[01:44:30]  Are you going on someone?  It's a satellite thing.  It's a continuous.  I just continue to talk.  Oh, my God, Louis.  Okay, I thought maybe you were waiting to go on someone else's show.  If you would have came in.  No, listen, assholes.  That I wouldn't do.  Got it?  All right.  Just so you know, I would sit around in a green room to go on hooky-pookies.  Our listeners are writing in and saying that you're in someone's green room waiting to  go on his show.  They're insane.  Okay?  You're calling our listeners insane?  How dare you?  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, like, yeah, look. 
[01:45:00]  They're not going to be happy with you.  You know, who is now?  The worst thing you could do is become successful.  Then they go, oh, boy.  See, I knew he was a prick.  Sellout.  Yep, exactly.  Hey, Louis, we're in the July 2005 issue of Hustler Magazine.  Yeah.  Oh, very good.  Hustler.  A huge, huge interview with your pals, Opie and Anthony.  What about Norton?  Well, Norton gets a little mention here and there.  A little.  He actually gets a picture in the article.  That's a big improvement.  We like to make believe he doesn't really exist, but it got through the cracks and he 
[01:45:30]  made Hustler Magazine with us.  Very nice.  Now, Norton's blowing up.  Everyone knows that.  How are you doing, Jim?  I'm okay, man.  How's everything?  Obviously doing very well.  The same old.  It's still the same.  Nothing changes.  You're still miserable?  Yeah, of course.  Why?  Why would I be happy?  Well, because Britney Spears is having a baby.  And if that's not the third sign that the fucking devil is coming, I don't know what  is.  You had to know that was coming, though.  That white trash.  Yeah, but you know, that's where you have laws. 
[01:46:00]  That's where you go, uh-uh.  No, you can't have a baby.  We're building a wall.  She's going to destroy that hot body of hers.  That's the biggest problem.  That supple, young body of hers.  Yeah, like she didn't destroy it by standing next to the devil.  You know what's great about that, Lewis?  There's nothing really going on in the world.  You know, so we reserve the front page for Britney Spears and her pregnancy.  Because, you know, you don't want to use that space for anything else going on in the  world.  Well, either that or, you know, we're going to find out what's in the president's iPod. 
[01:46:30]  The president has an iPod?  You didn't hear this one?  No.  Oh, my God.  Enlighten us, Lewis.  Oh, you guys will love it.  You've got to go through this.  Go online, because you'll go on for weeks.  Oh, really?  Where is that?  It's got to be.  It was in yesterday.  Oh, yesterday.  It was in yesterday's Times.  Oh, we don't read that paper.  The Times.  No, just calm down.  There are other places to get it.  The Times?  Is that a newspaper here in New York?  Lewis, you're a big star these days, so let me tell you what happens with the New York 
[01:47:00]  Times every day on this program.  You actually read a cover to cover, I'm sure.  No, I don't, because you actually develop a hemorrhoid.  All right.  Well, we use the New York Times when the girls come in here to get naked, because we've got  a bunch of faggots that work with us, so we have to cover all the windows so they don't  get a peek of nudity.  No.  And we end up using the New York Times.  It's perfect.  It's perfect to cover these windows.  We have the New York Post.  Why do we need the Times?  Yeah, the Post is very informative.  You know that.  Yeah, it's the only paper with the guts to print its own news.  That's right. 
[01:47:30]  But the thing was is that he has an iPod.  It has Alan Jackson on it.  It's got My Sharona.  My Sharona?  Oh, my God.  And it's just, what's it, not Clint, whatever.  Clint Black.  I don't even know these guys' names.  Clint Black.  Well, I'm going to help you out, because I got the story in front of me.  It's heavy on traditional country singers like George Jones, Alan Jackson, and Kenny Chesney. 
[01:48:00]  No, that's Kenny Chesney.  Whatever.  He has selections by Van Morrison.  Any stuff on the Panzerfaust line?  He's got a brown-eyed girl.  Brown-eyed girl is a Bush favorite.  He likes John Fogarty's center field.  Yeah, which actually creates nausea when you're home.  And it goes on and on.  We're going to have to read this article here.  I never thought he was so...  He has My Sharona, though?  Yeah, of course.  Why not?  Why not have the answer to a trivia question?  He probably, that probably holds a spot in his heart when he used to do cocaine. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, and I said it also, he probably has on it, you know, like one of those things,  you are the master of the universe, you are the master of your own fate.  Oh, really?  Like a motivational...  Oh, I'm sure it's on there.  Speakers?  He is just, he has reached, I think, it's epic insanity.  Well, you voted for him.  Oh, yeah, I voted for him.  I raced out to vote for him.  I stood there, I went into the thing, and I said, the first thing I asked before I went  in the voting booth this time is if there was a lever that said, kill me now. 
[01:49:00]  And I also, I'll tell you this, if anybody out there is inspired by Bush, or if you were  inspired by Kerry, you're the son of a bitch that when I was in high school, when the principal  spoke, you wept openly.  Oh, really?  Yes.  All right.  That didn't go over very well.  Yeah, that one was not your A material.  That was...  Lewis is saving it for the next...  Yeah, sure.  Wow, you guys have just become creepy. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, boy.  When are you going to hang with us, Lewis?  I'm coming in in May.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  By the way, the phones have exploded, and a lot of people are saying you just killed at  Avalon in Boston.  It was good.  It was fun.  I love seeing your stand-up.  I haven't seen you in a while.  I can't wait to see you here in New York.  I do it now in a prom dress, and that's what I'm going to help.  Lewis, you should have came in and did all your satellite interviews from our studio. 
[01:50:00]  We could have had a lot of fun with this today.  Well, I didn't know that.  We would have helped you out.  Son of a bitch.  Well, nobody tells me things I'm telling you.  I've got my trainers around me.  I see that.  There's too many people around you these days.  The country.  Are you losing touch?  Insulation?  Are you losing touch with the common man, Lewis?  No, I'm not losing touch with the common man.  How do you lose touch with the common man?  When you live in New York, you've got to be almost blind.  You like living in New York still?  You've always had a problem with New York.  No, I like living here.  I love living here.  How's the love life, Lewis? 
[01:50:30]  I don't have the energy.  You guys used to have those pills for me.  Right, right.  We had a lot of dick pills advertising on the show.  Fortress nine.  We've got to get that back again.  Herbal goat cheese.  Remember the stuff that we used to advertise?  Oh, my God.  Horny goat weed.  Horny goat weed.  That was it.  That was my personal favorite.  From the Phuket Mountains of China.  We had to read this crap like we really believed, too.  Oh, hey, and if they come back tomorrow, you'll hear it again tomorrow. 
[01:51:00]  What about, Lewis, do you remember the one for sweet release?  Yeah.  Yeah, that flavored your batch, so the girls actually got a flavor of banana or cherry or vanilla.  Got a nice little surprise.  When you splooched in their mouth.  Bonus.  Bonus.  I used to use it as a whipped topping.  Once you run out of whipped topping, I used to start some of that.  Yeah, you just down a few of the pills and jack off on your donut. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, either that or my ice cream.  That's great.  Very good.  All right, Lewis, we're going to let you be.  All right, listen, guys, I will be in May.  I'm going to talk to Schmucky, and we're going to work this out.  All right.  What's the next radio station that is fortunate enough to have Lewis Blackhawk?  I have no idea.  You don't even know?  They just hit you with it?  Literally, it's just a bump, bump, bump, you know.  And do you make believe you listen to every program?  No, there's certain people that I've talked to, so it's, you know, like, what was it, 
[01:52:00]  the first one this morning, Tom Bernard in Minneapolis.  I hear he's a pretty cool guy.  He is cool.  He's very good.  You know, there's actually these really solid morning people.  Yeah.  And then there's these people who should just be exterminated.  I mean, you know, Norton knows all of them.  Yeah, he's been on a few.  I think you're talking to a couple of them.  Oh, shut up.  But for other reasons you want us out of the picture.  I'm going to kill you.  You know what?  I'm going to bring it out.  I'm going to end the show by killing you.  Lewis, I was telling a great Lewis Black story the other day, not on the radio, but 
[01:52:30]  when you got arrested for the voyeur bus, the teen voyeur bus thing, I stressed out  so bad.  Do you remember I was, like, in the office?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you were unbelievable.  I was in the office, and I looked like I was on, like, a four-day coke binge waiting  for you guys to get out of jail.  I felt really bad and stuff.  Well, don't worry, because Jim and I, they cut us huge checks.  Yeah.  They made up for all of the suffering.  You can look up the articles online to the new listeners, because it's a legendary story 
[01:53:00]  now, but it was the teen voyeur bus, and Norton and Lewis Black, we barely knew either  guy, really.  You know, you guys were just becoming friends with the program, and you got arrested for  us with another 12 people or whatever, and I'm stressing out like crazy.  Oh, yeah, you were a rat.  And I think you were doing the Daily Show at this point, so I'm like, oh, my God, we got  this guy arrested.  He's never going to do our show again.  I mean, we did know you pretty well, I guess, is what it comes down to.  Anyway, you come in, and I'm just like, I'm like apologizing to Lewis.  I'm like, Lewis, I'm so sorry. 
[01:53:30]  I didn't know it was going to go down this way.  And you're like, why are you apologizing?  You just made my career.  I'll talk about this shit for the next year on stage.  I actually am the one that convinced Lewis to go.  We were debating that we'd go on this bus, and Lewis was like, I don't know, and I'm  like, what are you, naked teenagers?  What are we, fucking idiots?  Do it.  See, you get roped in with those nude teens.  And you didn't really know us, so you thought we were in control?  No, I knew you guys pretty well.  I just thought, you know, what could, you know, and I've been on the bus once already. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, that's true.  I was on the bus the first time.  It's like, what could possibly go wrong?  Yeah, really, really.  It's New York, you know, and the law is on our side.  The worst part of that whole thing, man, was not smoking.  That was the worst part of that entire ordeal.  It wasn't the disease to the roaches.  And the captain turning to Norton when Norton says, you know, the good thing is, you know,  Lewis and I are going to be in there together, so we each have somebody to cover our back, 
[01:54:30]  and the guy looked at us and said, are you guys stupid?  Do you really think you're going to protect each other?  Yeah.  Just laughed at us.  That was after, like, nine hours when we were starting to crack.  I could see Lewis jumping in to help Jim when some weight, some guy that's been in the weight room  in prison for a few years starts trying to assault Jimmy.  Yeah, Lewis will jump right in.  Lewis will jump in with that, like, attacking twitch finger and try to push the man off of me.  Get off my friend. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, he's pointing at him, poking him in the chest.  That's going to do a lot of good.  I actually saw that.  That guy, I think, was a lieutenant or a captain, the guy that sat down and actually let us smoke.  Yeah.  I saw him in a deli around the corner from my house.  Really?  And I said, the one thing you should always say to a cop, I went, hey, do you remember me?  Which never puts a cop on guard at all.  No.  And I explained who I was.  He's like, oh, man, you guys got such a shitty deal.  We had nothing.  He actually admitted.  He's like, yeah, that was a bad deal.  We never should have arrested you.  We had nothing on you guys.  That was fun.  Well, when you piss off the mayor of a city, you know, things happen.  Yep. 
[01:55:30]  Things happen.  Abuse of the law is what that was.  Hell yeah.  And I think he mentioned you and said he was a fan.  He was like, yeah, I see you, Lewis, on the Daily Show.  He didn't want to talk about me.  He wanted to talk about your marketing career.  Lewis, that Daily Show, man, I mean, it is just great.  It really is.  It's gotten very good.  It's just one of the best things on TV.  I enjoy it every night, and you're just kicking ass on that program.  It's fun.  Lewis' segment on that.  Very funny.  Love it, love it, love it.  Well, I'm going to see you guys in May.  All right, Lewis.  I'm going to call Ben, and we'll work it out.  And I'll see you shortly.  All right, sounds great.  Thank you, Lewis.  Hey, guys, thanks a lot for being kind. 
[01:56:00]  What's the name of the book again, seriously?  Nothing's Sacred.  Nothing's Sacred by Lewis Black.  It's getting great reviews.  All right, and you've got tickets for Alice Telly.  There'll be two under your name.  What do I do?  Talk to you?  Well, we'll figure it out off air.  All right.  I'll get you.  Thank you, Lewis.  Okay, bye-bye.  Bye, sweetie.  There he goes.  Lewis Black, everyone.  Nice.  There it is.  Wow, we just talked for like an hour and a half.  We've got to eat cereal and take dumps.  What was that we're going to do now?  I need coffee.  Why wasn't I involved in the latest coffee order?  You were busy chatting with Lee. 
[01:56:30]  You didn't get coffee.  You didn't get coffee.  Lee is just out of his mind.  I love the guy.  He's a psychopath.  Is he gone for the day now?  They're going to be back later.  Yeah, proving that they are making another deal.  There's something going on.  So go online and buy some stupid XM shares today.  Where's the other guy?  Can we get the Ed in here?  That sounds a lot better, by the way.  That's not inside trading.  I just know when Elo is in New York with Lee Abrams or Hugh Panaro, something's going down  and you should buy shares.  I don't know.  Isn't that inside?  No.  Because he just went on the radio.  Yeah.  It's not exactly a secret. 
[01:57:00]  No, because Elo swears that he's here because the studio was tweaked for the last two weeks.  Why?  What happened?  He's got a conference call.  He's got a conference call with who?  Other Amber Alert people?  Who's he talking to?  That psycho?  All right, whatever.  They're telling me to shut up.  I know Elo's not here for us.  Yeah, who cares?  No, of course.  I know that.  That's obvious.  I don't care about anything.  Eric's here doing other stuff.  I mean, Chauncey called and told me himself. 
[01:57:30]  That loser.  All right.  Oh, we have to play this again.  What's that?  Oh, by the way, can I mention one more thing before we go to break?  You guys got some really nice press in Boston that I forgot to mention.  Because I know there was an interview, which...  Wow, what was that?  There was an interview at the end that we did in Boston.  Uh-huh.  I kind of didn't want to do it.  I said, again, I'm sitting these things out for whatever.  Syndicated set.  This is in Boston.  Sean McCarthy. 
[01:58:00]  How long did you talk to him for?  About 15, 20 minutes right after our Bill's Bar show.  And I came in for probably the last 10 minutes.  What an article.  Oh, really?  Just give me a half hour to get through this.  All right.  Hotline.  They're back.  Oh, does that mean he's spelled back with a lot of A's?  A lot of A's.  Bunch of A's.  Bunch of A's.  Okay.  I'm smart.  Syndicated satellite radio team, Opie and Anthony, celebrated their first broadcast on  basic XM radio yesterday with a live show in the shadow of Fenway Park.  Boston's always been huge for us, Anthony Koeman says. 
[01:58:30]  Koeman?  Yeah.  C-U-M-I-N.  Yeah, Koeman.  C-U-M-I-N?  Yeah.  The morning duo.  I'm a spice.  That's not Koeman.  Yeah.  That's coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Anthony Koeman said.  Yeah.  Anthony, you were coming as you were talking to the reporter?  Jesus.  I was coming.  Were you whacking like a monkey in front of the guy?  The morning.  Oh.  That's that slang way of spelling coming.  Yeah, there is an apostrophe at the end.  Yeah, coming.  The morning duo dismissed from AAF after April Fool's hoax and blah, blah, blah, has been 
[01:59:00]  available only to premium XM satellite subscribers before yesterday, Opie and Anthony, along with  sidekick Jim Norton.  Oh, Jesus.  That's actually fine.  And their assorted characters were put on another.  Of course, because it's very accurate.  It certainly is.  Which is basically bleeding.  Patrice shit on me one time.  You're a sidekick!  Oh, oh.  Because about a tough crowd?  Yeah.  He was really just right.  And I really am a man who just has never made a stake in anything.  I am fucking Kenny Coattails.  Believe me, I'm aware of that.  Oh, Kenny Coattails.  Here's what I am.  I'm, as the picture's ready to be snapped, put my head up in it. 
[01:59:30]  That's what I am.  You know, I'm not even going to argue that point because...  No, I'm zellig.  Because when Anthony and I...  Let's go over it really fast.  We're on top of the radio world and we get fired.  Our careers are destroyed in one day.  One stupid idea, okay?  Now, you guys didn't get to live our lives.  Anthony and I went away.  We went our own ways for a while.  And every once in a while, we'd come back to say hi to our old friends.  Sure.  So we'd be invited to, like, roasts and comedy memorials and such, right? 
[02:00:00]  Sure.  I remember being at one of these roasts in the middle of the village somewhere.  Yeah, the Boston Comedy Club.  Boston Comedy Club.  They invite us, Ant and I, saying hi probably for the first time in six months.  Sure.  Six months, all of a sudden, we're having a little reunion in the back of the place.  Uh-huh.  And Norton's there.  And at this point, Norton has moved on with his career.  He's doing Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn.  Yep.  And there's his old pals that gave him one of his bigger breaks in the back of the room. 
[02:00:30]  Where's Norton sitting?  Oh, not with us.  Right next to Colin Quinn.  Next to Colin Quinn, who Norton probably hasn't seen since Tough Crowd ended.  I saw that fucking balloon-headed zero last night.  You did?  Yeah, and his awful haircut.  Balloon-headed.  He has a 58-pound skull, and he's on the road now.  You have no more show, stupid.  I don't need to talk to you anymore.  Oh, God.  Believe me.  All I do is nod and smile at Geraldo when I see him now.  Oh!  Colin's out.  Geraldo's in.  You are cruel. 
[02:01:00]  But you, you know, you're talking about jumping on people's coattails.  I remember that.  Listen, I did not.  Look, before us, dude, come on.  Before us, he was with Dice.  Right.  You were riding the Dice train around the country.  I certainly was.  You are, that is a talent, my friend.  I don't look down at you for that.  And what was really funny, you weren't able to hop from one to another as they peak.  I'm a toad with mediocre talent and great legs.  I can leap really far.  Even the pilot that I did, not my pilot, but Louis C.K. 
[02:01:30]  But you're there.  I sneak right in like Zelig.  Ka-ching!  Picture taken.  There he is again.  He's there.  I know that guy.  Man who just can't make his own steak.  Just watch what other men do and somehow take your fucking fat body and be a part of it.  What was so funny about that roast, Anthony and I were in the back row and everyone was  commenting how you were sitting right next to Colin Quinn.  Oh, yeah.  They did.  And hanging us up to dry.  Could you at least, Boston, could you just look at them?  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, Boston gets up to the podium and starts doing his act and just really laid into us. 
[02:02:00]  Could you look at them?  It's not like you guys have to be up for work in the morning.  Yeah.  We got killed that day as well as we should have.  It was a very funny night, and they all commented that you were sitting very close to Colin and  ignoring us.  But really fast.  Rich Voss was on Dennis Miller last night.  Oh, shit.  I told you.  Oh, my God.  He killed.  Did he good?  Good, good.  Yeah.  And looked like Dennis Miller was really enjoying Voss.  They did a little sit-down thing, five-minute sit-down thing.  That's great.  Wow.  Voss said he was flying out to LA for that.  No, he killed last night. 
[02:02:30]  He did great.  Well, him and Bonnie, I think, have a show coming out because obviously they're dating and,  you know, it's on some Comedy Central's working on something with their chante.  Their fiance.  So anyway, getting back, was that all you wanted to say?  Yeah, but I also have to stand up for myself here before, you know, the whack bag people  fucking hang me out to dry.  The reason I wasn't sitting with my old pals was because I was one of the roasters, and  as is traditional, you have to sit.  There's a little placard with your name on it.  Oh, of course, Jimmy.  With all the roasters, and I was one of the roasters.  And? 
[02:03:00]  Had I not be, I still would have sat next to Colin, but on that particular night, I had  a good reason to not sit with my pals, O.P.  And I guess it was the concrete wall that prevented you from coming to say hi before and after.  Dude, I nodded from across the room.  I'm like, oh, and A.  See, they're around there if you want to go see them.  Opie was complaining about that, and I had to turn to him and say, you know, it's the  way it is.  We have to take care of ourselves now.  We can't depend on Jimmy. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, I know the line.  I'm trying to remember myself.  I want to say Santa Febler.  Good call is when he went in prison.  Oh, shit.  And they can't depend on Paulie anymore.  That's the same situation.  We were in the joint.  We had to just make do, sell our drugs, whatever we need to do to get through.  Another thing I was thinking about the other day, it's time for me to watch Goodfellas  again.  I watch that probably every month, whether I need to or not.  I know, but those movies, you know, those movies just kind of cycle through your life.  And then you look at your DVDs and realize, oh my God, I have to watch Goodfellas again. 
[02:04:00]  It's been too long.  Caddyshack's another one of those movies.  Yeah, that one I'm due.  I'm due to watch Caddyshack.  You're due for a Caddyshack viewing?  Well, since we spoke to Spalding, it's sort of like, I've got to watch it again.  You know who I met from Goodfellas?  He actually owns a restaurant in L.A. that I ate at.  My manager knows him.  He's the guy.  He's like, you want to see helicopters?  The guy that's...  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, you know...  The guy that sold the drugs in the hotel room?  That is what he did.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a restaurant owner in L.A.  And I didn't recognize him.  Like, yeah, that's the guy from Goodfellas who did the helicopters.  How cool is that? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, it's kind of a weird...  Just anybody that was in that goddamn movie.  Bob Gullib.  You know Gullib was in it, right?  The comedian?  Yeah, two niggas just stole my truck.  That was him?  That's Bob Gullib, yeah.  Wow.  And, uh...  How do I know that name?  He's a comedian.  He's friends with Voss.  He lives in L.A.  He's been around for years.  Everybody knows Bob.  Okay.  And Lorraine Bracco was as good as always.  She's the only one that could ruin The Sopranos.  She's terrible.  She really is.  They were going to find it, Henry!  That's good.  Yuck.  He threw me out of the car! 
[02:05:00]  Who, who, who, who, who?  You have a whore living upstairs!  There's a whore in your building!  Oh, what a mess.  What a whiny mess.  All right, we really have to take a break.  Oh, damn it.  Because, I mean...  We have to take a break!  Because I'm making brown dots in my underwear as we speak.  God damn it.  I got some poking going on at this point.  Is the turtle now coming out?  Oh, I think I got bingo in my underwear. 
[02:05:30]  Like a bingo marker?  Every time he shifts or lifts his cheek, the underwear crumples and the little dot ends up somewhere else.  I think I got bingo across, yes.  Oh, God.  Disgusting.  Hey, I'm proud of myself.  I made that one up on the fly.  That was a good one.  Thanks.  I appreciate it.  Let's stop and acknowledge that.  Thanks.  I usually go with the old...  Looks like a used shoeshine rag. 
[02:06:00]  But I was able to come up with something new.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, we have to break.  When we come back, Danny, the intern, still working for us.  Hey, guys.  Good to see you again.  Sorry we didn't really acknowledge you this morning.  Oh, yeah.  Danny and Nathaniel still here.  Oh, everyone's still here.  Yeah, we didn't lose anybody.  Travis and Ricky.  Wow.  He said that I thought they hired new people.  And, of course, Derek.  And I guess there was a lot of controversy when we were away.  What kind of controversy?  They were pretty much going to call the FBI while we were gone.  Swear to God.  Problem? 
[02:06:30]  Well, I don't want to give it away because it's unbelievable.  Someone handed me that disc.  I didn't even look at the picture.  There was something that was given to us that had just been laying around.  Yeah, that someone discovered and really freaked out, called Washington, were ready to call the authorities.  It was a whole thing that went on.  Really?  Stop.  Yeah, we'll get into that next.  All right.  Wow.  Somebody found a gay intern? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, wait.  Oh, my God, dude.  I'm going to call my lawyer.  All right.  Sorry you raised a faggot.  Let's calm down.  We have no idea.  There's someone gay in your studio.  There's a homo in your building.  We have no idea what he was and, quite frankly...  Upstairs on the fifth floor.  Quite frankly, we don't care.  That's right.  If he is, that's...  That's got to be tough around your golf buddies. 
[02:07:30]  Hey, that's the pole smoker we've been hearing about.  Yeah, that's him.  If he is, good for him.  All right.  All right.  I flushed the blazer down the toilet.  They would have found it.  Maybe you and Monica Lewinsky's father can play golf and trade how your kid sucks dick tips.  Stupid.  Look, we have no idea what that kid was up to.  What kid?  What do you mean, kid?  What?  We have no idea.  All right.  I don't even know who you're talking about. 
[02:08:00]  You should be proud of yourself.  Someone put a cock in your face.  You took it like a man.  As we go to break, once again, Anthony, Howard Stern talking about the company he wanted to go to.  Oh, here we go.  But this stupid idiot was stubborn and made the worst decision of his career.

It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  I thought that woman had such a shirt off.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  Show us your buttons. 
[02:09:30]  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  Oh, this is fantastic.  This sounds beautiful.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  Cancel your appointment.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  Stay out of the bushes. 
[02:10:00]  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  It's Ripple Mal Wednesday.  I just love a drive in the country, laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon, call 911. 
[02:10:30]  Hey, Anthony, a lot of people asking about the WOW stickers. 
[02:11:00]  A lot of new listeners, actually.  They're trying to figure out what the hell this WOW thing is all about.  Go to opianthony.com, and basically it's a sticker.  You can get them.  The info is up on opianthony.com, but basically you send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  We send out the WOW stickers, and it's a promotion that Anthony and I started  many, many years ago.  We've gotten a lot of press about it over the years, and it's great.  It works great. 
[02:11:30]  It's so easy.  WOW represents Whip Them Out Wednesday.  And now it's like Whip Them Out Whenever.  Yeah, pretty much.  If a girl sees a WOW sticker and they feel like it,  they're going to flash you while you're driving your car.  Right.  It's that easy.  The weather gets nice.  The girls are wearing some easily accessible clothing.  And then you'll be driving your vehicle.  You've got the WOW sticker on the back, or even the truckers, we noticed,  just scrape it in the dirt on the back of their rigs.  And then a girl sees that.  She knows the show.  She's familiar with the situation.  She'll pull up next to you and lift her shirt up. 
[02:12:00]  And then you know what it is?  It's a little treat on your nasty commute home.  You could be sitting in traffic.  You're all, oh, this sucks.  Your mind's just fixated on the fact that you're in traffic, and it blows.  And then all of a sudden you look over and go, wait, why is that girl?  Why is that girl showing me her tits?  Oh, it's the WOW.  And WOW works in some places better than others, obviously.  Like when you're going to a concert, and you're stuck in that stupid traffic,  going and coming from concerts.  Right. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, man, the WOWing that goes on.  Going and coming to, coming and going, sporting events, perfect.  When you're stuck in that traffic, that type of thing.  Going to the beaches and all that crap, you know?  Yep.  It seems to be a more festive thing.  But like, let's say, a funeral procession.  Funeral's a little rough.  Probably rough.  A little rough.  Probably wouldn't be as easy as the beach.  A little rough.  Something like that.  Right.  I don't know how you open up the casket and give a WOW at that point.  Maybe searching for a lost girl during an Amber Alert.  Probably not going to get a lot of WOWs. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, because the girls are a little more sensitive than the guys.  A little more sensitive.  They see the license plate up there on the thing,  and then they're looking at all the cars around them.  Yeah.  Trying to be helpful.  So they're a little busy.  They don't want a WOW at that point.  You're right, Anthony.  The scene of flaming wreckage.  You're probably going to rubberneck a little bit  and not want to maybe look at the WOW sticker and get a WOW.  So certain situations, a little easier than others.  Going to the racetrack?  Perfect.  Perfect.  There you go.  Perfect.  They get the races.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I'm just reading this. 
[02:13:30]  We're talking to Lewis, and I thought of it.  I should have asked him about it, but again,  we don't know what he's going to say.  I like The Daily Show.  I like Jon Stewart.  I think he's a really good comic.  He's a really good comic.  Yeah.  But this whole thing, remember, it's in this month's Hustler,  Tucker Carlson, Exit Stage Right.  Oh, yeah.  Which Crossfire, I think, was dumb.  A boring show, and I never watched it,  because I don't care about two boars just yelling at each other about politics.  It stinks, and I don't watch it.  But when Jon Stewart went on and kind of sandbagged them and got real 
[02:14:00]  and, you know, trashed the show,  I mean, not that I didn't agree with them that the show stinks,  but it just bothered me.  It drives me nuts, and then they said Tucker Carlson left,  and this is what makes me want to just vomit.  It seems CNN president Jonathan Klein agrees.  I guess I come down more firmly in the Jon Stewart camp.  I think Stewart made a good point about those noise levels of these types of shows,  which does nothing to illuminate the issues of the day.  The president of CNN comes down on the side of a liberal  as opposed to somebody on his own network on a show that he was, 
[02:14:30]  it just makes me sick.  Obviously, it's just the ratings.  If the ratings were good with Crossfire, it still would have been on.  And Jon came on, and he kind of trashed them both, which was good for him.  But then he's like, you're on there as a comic,  and the guy's like, well, tell a joke.  You know, the guy was annoyed, I guess.  And Jon's like, well, I'm not here to be your monkey.  And then the guy goes, well, how come you lobbed up all these softball questions to Jon Carey?  And Jon's like, well, I'm on Comedy Central.  And that seems like a really valid point.  But you can't play both sides.  You can't play both sides, man.  If you're on Comedy Central being a comic, 
[02:15:00]  then don't come on here and try to be serious and be poignant.  When they say, well, then, all right, be funny,  don't hide behind that one, well, I'm not going to be your monkey.  And they say, well, how come you lobbed up softball questions?  Well, I'm a comic.  Oh, so you're a monkey on your show, then you come on this show.  That's been bugging me since I heard it.  And what bugs me more is, and again, I like him as a comic.  And I'm not on Comedy Central anymore.  He's always been a genuine, I think he's a really good comic, man.  But that just drove me nuts, the way people thought it was this brave thing.  And I just disagreed. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, well, he's what is known as a bed-wetting liberal, they call him.  He is.  Bed-wetting liberal.  So if he was on maybe Al Franken's show, I'm sure it would have been all buddy-buddy,  back-slapping, and he would have been the monkey that day, making a lot of funny jokes,  them both agreeing on how much the right and Republicans stink.  And they would have had a good time.  But since this guy is right-leaning and Stewart is a bed-wetting liberal, 
[02:16:00]  obviously they didn't get along.  And I think he attacked the liberal on the show, too.  I don't remember who the liberal, who was the liberal?  Tucker Carlson was the conservative, and there was a liberal.  By me.  I have no idea which one is which.  Yeah.  It was a babbling, stupid show.  I mean, I'll give Jon Stewart that.  And he goes, but the one thing I didn't like, he said,  you have a responsibility to the public discourse, and you fail miserably.  I'm just tired of this dignity being given to these people, 
[02:16:30]  like they have this responsibility to the public.  I mean, it's entertainment dog shit.  They don't have a responsibility.  If you're dumb enough to get your opinion from these two assholes shouting at each other,  then you don't deserve to be informed about the issues.  If you can't read the paper yourself, or at least come to your own conclusions,  if you think that these two screaming fucks are the place that you're going to find out what's really going on,  then you're an idiot and you don't deserve to know what's going on.  People make the mistake of thinking because it's on CNN,  it has to be this responsible journalism that goes by this old code that the old journalists had of truth and this. 
[02:17:00]  People are getting confused.  CNN is an entertainment channel.  It is entertainment.  They give you news during certain parts of the show, just like a lot of the all news channels.  They will give you news that is supposed to be that responsible, fact-driven news.  But the rest of the day, you can't fill an entire 24-hour period with that.  So the rest of the day are these entertainment shows that people, for some reason, 
[02:17:30]  think are held to the same standard that journalists have.  And they're not.  They're opinions.  Editorials.  They're speculation.  Yeah, editorials.  It's entertainment programming.  And people seem to think it's supposed to be like Walter Cronkite giving us the news.  The evening news.  I just don't believe.  I think this show just annoyed him.  He didn't like it.  He probably just didn't like the conservative on it.  And just to come out like that, like it was this integrity-driven thing. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  And the public is so stupid.  Just the way they jumped off it.  Because I heard the audio.  I heard it.  You've got to see this.  He really shreds these guys.  So I listened to the audio.  He didn't shred these guys.  No.  He kind of played both sides of the fence a little bit.  And that kind of annoyed me.  It's like, what are you doing, man?  If he would have done it in a funny way, because I do think he's a bright guy.  And he is good at being political and being funny.  It's not easy.  It's a credit to his talent that I love the show.  And I find him hysterically funny on it.  Even though I know his politics are just like, they're not my politics. 
[02:18:30]  Right, right, right.  And for me to actually sit and enjoy him on a political show like that, it is a credit to his talent.  But it's like, you know, sometimes people get a little self-important.  And when entertainers start to think, it's like, I know it's a comedy show, but you know, you weren't really, I don't know what his John Kerry interview was like.  But it's like, if you're going to be so tough on these guys, why not be, if you want to talk about you're failing in the public discourse, well, you got one of the presidential candidates.  Be tough on him.  It wasn't, though.  I saw the interview.  It was about, he asked him nothing about the allegations of the rest of his, the riverboat people there, his boat people that turned on him. 
[02:19:00]  Nothing about that.  Nothing about his war record and everything that came up with that.  It was pretty much just a bush bash session.  Of course it was.  And then why do that and then come after these two guys who mean nothing?  Yeah.  Like, why save all the angst and the let's get down to brass tacks for these two, who are just two jack-offs? 
[02:19:30]  He shouldn't have been hard-hitting on The Daily Show with Kerry.  It should have been what it was.  Right.  It kept it very light and funny.  But then, yeah, you can't then go on and say, well, I'm here on a serious show.  Right.  Yeah, like, hey, all kidding aside, guys, I don't, I don't, you know, I don't like this kind of stuff.  Well, then how come if you're all kidding aside, why would you like that with John Kerry?  Well, I'm a comic.  I'm not supposed to be serious.  You know, it just annoyed me.  Go whine some more on your show.  That whole thing after 9-11.  Oh, my God.  What do you mean?  When he was just crying.  I did.  I don't know.  I did. 
[02:20:00]  I swear to God, I've seen The Daily Show ten times.  And then he's just, you know, I mean, if you're that taken by what happened on 9-11,  you know, the guy was talking about how he, his apartment overlooked the World Trade Center  and how now it's gone, but now in its place is the Statue of Liberty.  You know, and he loses his mind.  Who said that?  John Stewart.  Right on the show.  It's like, all right, but then to turn around and have your politics so in line with letting 
[02:20:30]  something like that absolutely happen again, you know, hey, believe me, I'm not saying  that Bush and the right and the Republicans have the answers, that's for sure.  Yeah, they don't.  I'm not saying that.  But the way his politics are, it just leaves us really open up for some more nasty crap.  And can I say, I know I'm going to get the emails, save yourselves the time.  Every time I talk about something like this, I get the emails, you know, dude, stop bashing  liberals.  No, I'm not going to stop bashing them.  And yes, I do bash conservatives, too.  The conservatives are at church with freedom. 
[02:21:00]  They're equally as stupid as the far left.  They're both morons who don't know how to, who can only follow a party line and have  no moderation, can't make up their own minds.  I'm laughing at you guys because, you know, getting into some serious stuff here, which  we do on the program, right?  And so I can't be bothered with some of that stuff, so I just kind of go do my thing for  a while and I'm eating my cereal, right?  Yeah.  So I'm like, yeah, might as well, while they, you know, take care of this like they do,  and it's important to the show, I'll see what I could do to make the show better. 
[02:21:30]  So I'm just going to read the instant feedback.  These are four right in a row.  All right.  You guys are giving it your all, you know, giving your point, okay?  And this is what people are commenting on.  Jeremy from Toronto.  Can someone please buy Opie a fucking soft plastic spoon?  Sounds like a broken wind chime in the background.  Fast Freddy, please tell Opie to stop with the eating.  Booby Man from Brooklyn.  Opie, is your oatmeal good?  You are scraping the bowl like you never ate it before. 
[02:22:00]  Stop it, faggot.  M. Beavis.  It just keeps going on and on.  Opie, stop clanking your spoon on your cereal bowl, you tool.  Chester's Liver.  Okay, I'm trying to listen to you, Ant, but I hear what must be Opie's spoon hitting the  bottom of his bowl.  Flang.  Not complaining.  I think it's actually funny.  It just goes on and on, on and on.  That cereal yummy Opie is someone making chocolate milk in the background. 
[02:22:30]  That's what it sounded like.  And I'm thinking I'm just being discreet, like, all right, I'll listen in and, you  know, I'm starving over here.  My blood sugar level seems to be dropping a little.  I'll just take this moment to get some food in me.  Holy shit, stop at the fucking cereal bowl, Opie.  It just goes on and on, so.  All right.  We've got to get Danny in here.  Danny.  Something really crazy happened while we were on break.  Am I hearing this right?  Norton is getting all his deep political insight from Hustler Magazine. 
[02:23:00]  Well, yeah.  It's pretty consistent, I'd say.  Okay.  What are you going to...  Danny.  I see you're letting my head roll a little.  A little bit.  What do you think?  That's all right.  What did you do during it?  It's like boss's awful Jew hair.  It's not bad.  I worked, Ant.  You worked?  Yeah, these guys worked.  These guys worked for free while they enjoyed the...  Damn, you didn't go on a cruise?  The two-week vacation.  Nope.  Nope.  I came here a couple of days.  I was helping Ziggy out with the store.  Dude, I'm walking the beach trying to figure out if I should start smoking pot again. 
[02:23:30]  I'm searching out the coconut man every day.  I'm dining with the captain.  And these guys working for free.  Working for free.  Back in New York.  The ONA slaves.  Very good.  Well, there was a controversy.  Yes.  Yes, Danny.  What happened?  The FBI was almost involved?  Pretty much.  You guys know Mars, the engineer here.  He wanted to tell me a story.  He said it was pretty funny.  So he was telling me that somebody had moved a box that was in here into the room in the back. 
[02:24:00]  And it was apparently...  It was into one of our offices that we don't use.  All right.  One of the offices that we demanded from XM.  We demanded that they build all these offices.  Well, we have an office, but me and Opie needed another office.  That's right.  So we demanded we have an office with just two desks in it for us to get away from the riffraff.  And, you know, if you listen to this program, we make it sound like there's no one else in this facility.  It's all about Anthony and I and Jim Norton, of course. 
[02:24:30]  And, you know, they had to make a lot of space for the Opie and Anthony show here in New York.  And it was a small space to begin with.  And that wasn't good enough for us.  We're like, no, we need to take over the entire conference room.  We need the whole kitchen area as our private offices.  We need, need, need, need, need, build, build, build, or we're not coming.  Right.  So then the rest of the gang had to be shoved into tiny little cubicles.  Their space that was small to begin with got smaller.  Now the area where the coffee machine and everything was, now it takes up like a two-foot spot on a shelf. 
[02:25:00]  Pretty much their lunch room.  So they built these really nice offices so Anthony and I could get away.  We haven't used them once.  Yeah.  So I guess a box from the studio was moved into one of these offices.  You got it.  And Mars was kind of curious of what was in the box because it was kind of bulging on the side.  What's in the box?  Tell me what's in the box.  What the fuck?  Don't we have that somewhere?  No, I think you did that somewhere.  We should get it though. 
[02:25:30]  No, we had it.  I played it once.  All right, go ahead.  So Mars opens the box and sure enough inside is the Pickled Punk.  Oh, the Pickled Punk.  Who did we get that from?  Andrew Gore.  Andrew Gore.  And I openly admitted that it has brought me bad luck for the two and a half years that he gave it to me.  He gave it to me like two and a half years ago and there's been some weird things that have happened in my life.  It's like the Greg Brady tiki that you wear around your neck. 
[02:26:00]  And I was thinking it was in my closet in my New York apartment.  I'm thinking, you know, who knows?  Maybe it would be smart to just give it back to the guy.  And maybe, maybe it will help my luck.  Maybe.  It is taboo.  Maybe it will help my luck.  Taboo.  So I brought it back in here because he was supposed to be in New York.  Does everyone know what a Pickled Punk is?  I don't know if all our listeners know.  It's from an old circus term.  Yeah, it's from the old side shows.  You would pay your dollar or back then, what was it, a quarter or a nickel?  A nickel? 
[02:26:30]  It was like a nickel or something.  Yeah, a nickel.  And you'd go in and see these.  They're deformed fetuses.  You know, maybe spontaneous miscarriage or something like that.  Or what, did they have abortions back then?  Who knows?  How did they get these things?  They give them cute names and stuff.  Two-headed.  Yeah, they'll have two heads and three legs.  They'll just be so deformed they'll look like Lizard Baby or something.  Yeah, the lion head boy.  Things like that.  Yeah, lion head boy.  And it's really disgusting.  So Andrew gave one to Opie. 
[02:27:00]  Because Opie had a fascination about it.  He had a fascination with it and was asking for one and got one.  And in Andrew's old crib, and thank God he finally moved.  So if the FBI wants to question me, I have no idea where he lives now.  He had a display in this old joint that was just unbelievable.  We've talked about the Siamese babies with the diapers on them.  Yeah, little diapers on them.  In a fish tank.  And these things were so old, they had like really, really old locks on them and stuff.  From the original owners and stuff.  These things have been passed down, you know, generations. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Pickled punk.  Very funny name for it.  Yeah, yeah.  Dead fetus.  Yeah.  So he finally gave me one.  It's a little present.  Little pickled Peterson.  Well, that's where this gets interesting, by the way.  Oh, Jesus.  So you found it was bringing you bad luck.  As you had it hanging around your neck when you went surfing.  Oh, I thought it couldn't hurt to bring it back and give it back to the owner.  Take it back?  So it's been just kind of laying around. 
[02:28:00]  Mr. Connelly, give you directions to the cave?  Right.  And then what happened with Tiki?  Your TV dad took it and wore it around his waist.  Well, I had a discussion.  I had a discussion with Vincent Price and, uh...  Yeah, Vincent Price.  He was in that episode.  We all went to a luau.  I do nothing wrong.  Let's do nothing wrong.  So, um...  It is taboo.  So we brought it...  I brought it back in.  Yeah.  And it ended up in a box because no one really wanted to look at it. 
[02:28:30]  And then, you know, this place is kind of cluttered and it was just forgotten about.  Yeah, I definitely did not want to look at that thing anymore.  So the box was moved to this office that Anthony and I don't use.  And then what happened?  Sorry, Danny.  Getting back to you finally.  That's all right.  So Mars opens it up, sees that it's a...  Indeed, a fetus in a jar.  And doesn't remember that you had brought this in and spoke about it on the air.  Fetus in a jar.  So he proceeds to freak out and grabs Poe and brings him in to ask him...  Poe wrestled it to the ground. 
[02:29:00]  It's real.  If it's fake.  They're freaking out.  Poe wants to call the police.  And, uh...  Oh, my God.  So, yeah.  So Mars finds this in the back office because he had to go get something.  And he looks into the box and there's the pickled punk.  And, yeah.  Did they ever hear us talking about this thing?  That's why I'm surprised.  Jesus.  So then Master Poe got involved and then Bruce, who runs the New York facility, got involved.  And they're all just staring at it.  Master Poe put a little gi on it.  Taught it a few kicks.  So then what happened there, Danny?  Well, apparently some calls were made down to Washington. 
[02:29:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Here we go again.  That's all Washington needs now with phone calls.  Oh, what's the problem?  Equipment thing?  No, there seems to be a fetus here in the...  In a jar.  In a mayonnaise jar.  Oh, God.  Looks like it might have been born this week.  Great.  Oh, boy.  And no one could figure out if it was real or fake.  And Mars decided that he just had to find out for himself.  No way.  Yep.  Are you kidding?  Put on a glove, cracked it open, and started poking it. 
[02:30:00]  Why would you open that?  That hasn't been opened in decades.  Yeah.  Probably 90 years.  If you look at it, it looks like it's plastic.  Yeah.  So he poked it and realized it is real.  Indeed, it was real.  Well, he was telling me that the night before, he was in bed.  What did it feel like?  And he was just...  He couldn't fall asleep.  Oh, my God.  My puke.  Oh.  Oh, it just hit me.  Oh, it didn't feel like...  Oh, my God.  Like a raw chicken leg.  Dude, look at my arm.  Where the skin moves around a little on the bone. 
[02:30:30]  It takes a lot to get me skeeved.  I just...  I just like...  Wow.  That was the beginnings of a puke.  That is really bad.  He was telling me the night before, he was just thinking about whether it was fake or not.  And he just could not fall asleep.  And he was just saying to himself,  All right, tomorrow I'm just going to go in.  I'm just going to have to...  I've got to touch it.  You will be molested.  You will be molested.  You have to touch it.  Yeah.  So he was poking at it?  Yeah, if we want, I guess we could ask him what it felt like, if you guys want to know.  Ew.  What does a pickled punk feel like?  I just like the way Danny tried to direct the show. 
[02:31:00]  I kind of like that.  Yeah.  Guys, get him in here.  Are you kidding me?  Guys, get him in here.  Bring him right in.  It's a good point, young man.  And all the other interns laughing.  Oh, yeah.  They revel in others' failure.  He hasn't seen Ben in three hours.  He figured, what the hell?  I'll give it a shot.  I like the fact that young Danny and his new Carmine Ragusa hair.  So what did you do when you found the pickled punk?  Did you slide on the floor and sing Rags to Riches? 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  Mars is in the studio.  How are you doing?  So, are you on?  I don't know.  I hit myself.  Talk again, Mars.  Hello, hello.  He's on.  They're a little long.  I want to adjust that mic.  Okay.  No, not your headphone volume.  I know.  Silly.  So what happened?  You found the pickled punk in the back office?  Yeah.  And the thing was that I didn't know how I got there.  You never heard us talking about the pickled punk on the show?  Unfortunately, I did not. 
[02:32:00]  So my concern was that someone dropped it off maliciously because maybe we're making jokes  of Lacey Peterson.  Oh.  So someone dropped off the pickled punk.  I'm wondering how long it took the pickled punk to fill out all the paperwork.  And Poe taking pictures of it.  It actually started when it was in the guy's balls.  It went through the whole pregnancy and the abortion and the formaldehyde.  You forgot to sign here, little thing.  And what kind of ID did the pickled punk actually have for Poe? 
[02:32:30]  I need a photo ID.  Gentlemen.  Yeah.  All right.  So after that, the first thing I did, of course, was pull Poe over.  And he was like, oh, I don't know if that's real.  And I kept saying that it is real.  And then I spoke to Bruce as well.  You found out it was real by poking it.  Well, actually, you can tell it's real.  I've seen one of those in Germany.  Really?  Yeah.  And it looks very real.  But you still had to poke it. 
[02:33:00]  Ultimately, to actually really find out if it was real.  Actually, what part of the body did you poke?  The head.  Oh, of course.  The head.  That's good.  Did it go back into the left?  Jesus.  You're poking the head of a fetus.  That's real smart.  Well, you know, I had to find out.  Again, like I said, I had no knowledge that it was here before, so I thought it was a malicious act.  So I noticed that it was very detailed.  I saw the genitals.  It's a little girl.  Ooh.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Did you take it out of the jar?  No, I did not.  I moved the jar around.  You wanted to see its genitals.  That's why you touched it.  You didn't poke the head.  You opened the legs.  You sicko.  Has a little tiny anus.  Ooh.  Oh.  Nice.  Yeah.  Keep talking.  All the details of that.  Sure.  I love this story.  So was it preserved in Jesus juice?  Actually, I was trying to smell the...  I never touched that fetus.  It's not formaldehyde, but it's not too much of a strong smell formaldehyde.  It's more of an alcohol-based... 
[02:34:00]  Better than that.  But you lost sleep the night before you decided to molest this thing?  Well, the thing was that some of my higher-ups thought that everybody wanted me to believe  that it was fake, and I was determined to prove that it was real.  Oh, it's real?  Yeah.  Scalpel?  It's real.  It's absolutely real.  You should have taken a bite out of it.  You sink your teeth into, like, halfway through the head and just bite through the  ears and the bridge of the nose, and you chew it.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:30]  Stop it.  You know the stench that would come off of that into your mouth and your molars?  Cook it up like hot wings.  No, you just eat it raw.  Just take a bite.  I betcha.  She wasn't aborted.  You know what it would come apart like?  I don't know how many people will get this reference, but remember when Damone went to  visit his pal there, Rat, in the restaurant when he was on the date, and he bit into that  thing at the table?  He goes, hey, Rat, how you doing?  Yeah, I come here all the time.  And he bit that thing, and it kind of popped and water shot out of it? 
[02:35:00]  Oh, my God.  Hey, you forgot your wallet.  You forgot your abortion over my...  Well, Dr. Morris said that...  Said that the tiny anus appeared to be of normal size and consistency, and he's saying  that it wasn't aborted.  How did you know it wasn't aborted?  Well, I think it's not aborted, because you would see bruises on the fetus if it was aborted.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And there are no bruises on the fetus.  Except for the finger marks you put in its head.  No, it probably has bruises. 
[02:35:30]  But isn't it gray?  No, it's whitish.  It's white.  It's whitish, so it doesn't really have any pigment on it.  It's well-preserved.  It's, yeah, it's disgusting.  Ugh, sandwich.  So then what happened?  What did you guys decide to do?  So ultimately, what happened was...  Let's drop it out the fifth floor window.  Oh!  Spolat!  We spoke to...  Long of our careers.  Spolat!  We spoke to D.C., and they wanted to ask one of you guys, but you guys were on vacation.  We didn't bother you. 
[02:36:00]  We were busy on a cruise ship.  Mm-hmm.  And we'd be bothered with dead fetus questions.  So when I come in on Monday, the first person that I see is Steve, and I says, hey, Steve,  by the way, there was a box in the back, and he says, oh, yeah, the fetus.  Oh.  And I freaked out.  I was like, oh, you know about it.  And he says, yeah, it's been with us all this time.  And he explained the story to me about Andy Gore and all that good stuff.  What happened to the fetus?  It is still in Opie's office.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, well...  Why don't you give it back?  That's just creepy.  Get that thing out of here. 
[02:36:30]  I've been trying, but...  Get that goddamn thing out of here.  Give it a proper burial.  They won't let me...  Take it out on a boat off of Modesto and drop it in the water.  They won't let me travel with it or anything.  Why?  Because you've got to pay for another ticket?  So...  He's afraid of a break in his bag.  You pull out a duffel bag, the fetus is stuck to the back of one of your books.  Oh, God.  See, one of its little feet has fallen off.  It's got the iPod headphones on.  You're going to make a great commercial.  All right, well, thanks. 
[02:37:00]  You're welcome.  Yeah, thank you for that...  Thanks, Danny.  Poking.  Poked his head.  The whole head's a soft spot, isn't it?  On something that old.  Oh, you did not come back.  He's been doing that to you for six months.  Walking back.  I'm going to poke him in the head.  All right, we'll take it out.  Wow, what are we going to do with that thing?  I don't know.  Come on, you've got to get rid of it.  I thought I did by bringing it back in here.  Do you want to send it back to Andy Gore?  Yeah.  I'm not mailing it.  Mail it.  You could send a fetus to the nail, can't you? 
[02:37:30]  I've got to figure something out.  I guess it's my responsibility.  Yes, it is.  I don't want it.  All right, we'll take another break.  We've got to catch up a little bit.  We've got a lot of stuff still to do.  We've got Mike Tyson audio.  Someone's suggesting a fetus hacky sack.  We'll give it to Joe Rogan for a fear-factor-eating stunt.  Ugh.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for the instant feedback, people.  This is driving him nuts, so we'll keep doing this. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, of course it is.  So here's Howard talking about our company.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along  for the ride.

[02:39:00]  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly.  You're going to need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New.  From the Hiv Corporation.  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Sensitivity training.  Maybe you could send someone from Human Resources in, and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area.  And then they can leave.  Jim will help you construct a business plan. 
[02:39:30]  Greed is good.  He'll guide you through the hiring process.  Hire all fat chicks if you don't want them harassed.  He's also a whiz at customer relations.  Here's what you do, stupid.

And he can help mend even the most fractured of family relationships. 
[02:40:00]  I killed my wife with a hammer.  And he'll also assist with time management.  130, Human Resources, attempts to talk about sensitivity training.  135, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks outdoor.  Ha ha!  End of meeting.  Call 1-800-LOG-DROP for the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Order today.  Meeting adjourned.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the bread.  Squeeze the bread. 
[02:40:30]  No shit.  Real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly good result.  We'll be an Anthony show.  In case you didn't know.  I realize you're mine.  And we hope you're mine.  I realize you're mine. 
[02:41:00]  And we hope you're mine.  Man, everything...  Wow.  Everything got loud.  Everything got really loud.  That just hurt my ears.  I don't know.  We were doing so well for so long today.  How did it just get loud?  It got really loud.  Well, we got the tech guys.  They're tweaking as we go.  They did a lot of work on the studio while we were gone on our vacation. 
[02:41:30]  And everything looks pretty good so far.  But they're tweaking and figuring it all out for the next couple of days.  So, bear with us as we bear with them.  What?  Will Ed come on?  I want Ed to come on.  No, now there's another...  Now he's busy.  Now he's busy.  That guy is a genius.  Got his shirt sleeves rolled up.  That guy makes you feel so freaking stupid.  We've got to get Ed on before the end of the show.  Problem?  Yeah, he's going to fix another problem. 
[02:42:00]  So, we'll get him on a little later.  There's a lot going on.  Love it.  A lot of stories we still haven't gotten to.  Oh, there's plenty of stories.  A lot of stories in the news today.  Stories.  Ah, stop.  Jesus.  We're so self-destructive.  Yes, we are.  We are the worst.  We're our own worst enemy.  Believe me, I'll hold it back.  I want to make Jimmy wet his pants because I know he'll laugh his ass off. 
[02:42:30]  He won't come on wire.  He's working.  Yeah, I know.  He's working as we speak.  He's tweaking.  He'll get to you when he can.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, we could...  There's plenty of stories in the news that we can have.  Well, the New York...  Well, actually, sorry.  They're the same paper to me.  But the New York Daily News did a lazy husband contest.  And they got the winner of that.  Well, of course they did.  What do you expect?  Of course.  Lazy husband.  Of course.  You want to do this?  Or you got the fake DJ over there. 
[02:43:00]  Then we got the disabled girl getting punched in the face.  Oh, that's under hot teen news.  Forced to perform sex acts.  I like that.  Can we talk about that one?  Because I think it's really a disturbing case.  All right.  It's a little disturbing.  It's upsetting.  Witnesses.  Disabled girl punched in face.  Forced to perform sex act.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Yes.  Did you hear me?  Maybe that slipped.  Maybe that slipped through. 
[02:43:30]  Maybe no one heard what I said.  I said witnesses.  Oh, oh.  Disabled girl.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm a little slow.  Hold on.  I'm trying to find my article here.  All right.  Yeah.  We're...  Okay.  Disabled girl punched in face.  Performed...  A forced to perform sex act.  Wow.  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[02:44:00]  We have the timing of throat cancer.  We're the worst.  Horrible.  I don't have any buttons.  I would have loved to have pushed one there.  A 16-year-old disabled girl was punched and forced to engage in videotaped sexual acts  with several boys in a high school auditorium as dozens of students watched, according to  witnesses.  They're investigating this at Mifflin High School.  It was at Columbus, Ohio.  Four boys suspected of involvement was sent home and have not returned to class. 
[02:44:30]  Also, the principal, Regina Crenshaw, was suspended and will be fired for not calling  police.  And three assistant principals were suspended and will be reassigned to other schools.  Wow.  This sounds like something we would have done.  Oh, her father said the girl was developmentally disabled.  A special education teacher said the teen had a severe speech impediment.  What is wrong with you? 
[02:45:00]  You are just the worst.  You really are just the worst.  I'm not the one that punched all the mush in the chops.  You really stink.  Stop laughing at me.  Yeah, really.  Stop laughing at me.  Please.  Stop laughing at me.  Open that big dinner.  Stop laughing at me.  She was probably talking up a storm and they're like, how do we get her to shut up? 
[02:45:30]  I have it.  Ding.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You're the worst.  You're stupid.  I agree with her.  Well, school officials.  Oh, severe speech impediment.  She had the old cock in the cleft palate disease.  Jesus.  What did she do to you?  Punch the retarded girl in the face and make her give you a hummer.  Wow. 
[02:46:00]  I don't understand how somebody does that.  I don't understand how you don't.  How do you hold back for as long as these boys did?  You hear that awful voice every day.  I don't understand where this comes from with Jimmy.  The girl was forced to perform oral sex on at least two boys, according to the statement  from school officials obtained by the Columbus Dispatch.  Part of the alleged assault was videotaped by a student who had a camera for a school project.  I give it an A.  Me too.  School officials found the girl bleeding from the mouth. 
[02:46:30]  An assistant principal cautioned the girl's father against calling 911 to avoid media attention.  And the girl's father called police.  And her father said the girl was developmentally disabled.  The special education teacher said the teen has a severe speech impediment.  Well, she does now.  But, man, whoever the kid is that did this, that's the future of just rape and crime and 
[02:47:00]  murder.  How do you just grab a developmentally disabled girl, punch her in the face, and then grab  her head and start to, you know, making her give you a little...  I don't care.  Stop touching yourself, Jimmy.  You're the worst.  I'm not the worst.  I'm not the one who does it.  All right.  I just think it's...  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Because you understand, that's what's wrong with our country.  It's not entertainment.  It's not dirty language. 
[02:47:30]  It's the fact that people are raising children that do this.  Animals.  And it's not only the people that did it, but someone videotaped it, and then other kids  watched it, and the teacher didn't call the police.  Like, that's where we're living.  It's not about your radio show or dirty language on TV.  That's the problem.  And that's why people blame entertainment and all this stuff, because they don't want  to acknowledge this underlying core of just what a disgusting group of human beings we  are.  Yeah.  This kid is raised in a household, right?  He's got at least one parent.  Where is that parent teaching this kid what's, you know, right or wrong? 
[02:48:00]  That you shouldn't...  You know, it shouldn't even get to the point where you have to say, don't punch developmentally  disabled girls in the mouth and then shove your cock in there.  Yeah.  You know?  It should have been...  Something should have been taught to this kid throughout the years that he wouldn't  even dream of doing something like that.  Let's go to the phones real fast.  Dan in Canada.  Dan?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I'm just wondering if maybe there's a comedy show going on in the auditorium and maybe  a certain Bob Kelly was present.  Oh, you think Bob...  A lot of people are wondering if Bob Kelly was the ringleader. 
[02:48:30]  Well, the thing is that everyone's missing is you don't have to punch a retarded girl in  the face.  Just tell her it tastes like candy.  Look at...  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  Stop laughing.  You're stupid.  It'll make you smart and pretty.  Oh, is that awful?  Yeah, it really is.  What other...  Well, let's say hi to Dave in Texas, then we'll move on here.  Dave?  Let's move on to another story.  Sure.  There's a bunch of them.  Dave, go ahead. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, guys.  You know, she may not be totally innocent.  I remember in my high school, most of the retards there were just horny as hell.  Oh, my God.  You're blaming the girl.  I'm not blaming her.  I'm just saying that she may not have been, you know, so opposed to it.  I've heard this about retards over the years, though, Anthony.  Are you insane?  Not that she was looking for this, obviously, but I've heard that retards are very, very  horny people.  Well, I've also heard about, you know, scenes of masturbation in the hospitals and stuff, 
[02:49:30]  but I don't think that's a sexual thing.  Like, it's a come on.  Like, it's a hey, you know.  I'm not saying that.  So you're saying maybe the girl was horned up and led these youngsters on?  No, no.  I'm just agreeing with this guy that I've heard over the years that retards are very, very  horny people.  And what difference would that make in this situation?  I'm not bringing that part of what he's saying into this situation.  Is Dave saying that maybe that makes a difference?  I was sort of changing the subject a little bit to horny retards.  Well, I can say for sure that when I was in high school, there were two retards that 
[02:50:00]  busted out of their little retard class, and they were found full-on fucking in a stairwell  by the science teacher in between class.  I mean, just, eh, eh, eh, going off.  All right.  What kind of speech impediment did she have?  She probably had big, dumb buck teeth.  All right, listen.  Oh, is that awful?  Listen, stop.  Stop now, please.  I beg you.  Stop.  Eh.  Stop.  Those teeth. 
[02:50:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right, I'm writing down my food order.  I know.  Hold on.  Can I have a smoothie?  Oh, you're going to get...  I want a smoothie so bad, but if I...  You know what happens, though?  What?  By, like, five o'clock, that smoothie works its magic.  It's good, though.  And I'm reading Popular Mechanics in the bathroom.  But that's the beauty of it.  Sitting on the bowl so long, I have baby fawn legs when I stand up, all shaky. 
[02:51:00]  I fall down.  A tiger tries to get me.  You should wobble out to your driveway and just splatter on your driveway so your stupid  birds have something to eat.  Don't eat human shit.  Oh.  Maybe some little niblets in there.  Well, the smoothies have some fine goodness in there.  And it's not...  The point is it hasn't stayed in, Anthony, long enough to become that.  Oh, stop.  I don't know what it is about a smoothie.  It turns everything into a salad shooter.  All right, I got something to play for you. 
[02:51:30]  Mom?  Mom?  Yes, honey?  You know when we were talking yesterday?  Yes, we were.  Do you know about periods?  Yes.  What about periods?  Do you have periods?  Yes.  All women have periods.  Tell me what happens.  Blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Do you have a question, Jill?  Yes.  I want to know if Susie has periods. 
[02:52:00]  Susie?  Yes, Mom?  Jill wants to know something.  We want, Jill.  Susie, do you have periods?  Do I have periods?  Jill, all women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  When I'm on my period, blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Susie, what about my teacher?  Does Miss Jones have periods?  Yes, Jill.  Your teacher, Mrs. Jones, does have periods.  All women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days. 
[02:52:30]  How dumb is this, kids?  You should be punched in the face and made to give a Hummer in a gymnasium.  Dude, that's stupid questions.  Yes, dude.  Wait, do you have a period?  Who do you get a period?  Ugh.  Ugh.  Don't you get how smart I am?  What?  She's a slow person asking about periods, and I segged into this.  Are you sure?  Oh, I thought she, I didn't know.  Yes.  I thought it was a little kid.  No, that wasn't like a daughter talking to...  It's a trainable.  Stop it.  Wow.  They used to be called trainables. 
[02:53:00]  I thought it was like a seven-year-old or something that's being told about periods.  No, this is trainables audio.  Oh, my God.  I love this stuff.  I cannot get enough of this.  I love old 50s sex tapes where they talk about sex.  Yeah.  And I love the trainable ones where it's teaching retards about, well, mentally challenged people.  Right.  About life, sex, things like that.  Ready to puke?  What is this one about?  Hi, girls.  Hi, Dad.  What have you girls been talking about? 
[02:53:30]  About periods, Daddy.  Dad, can I ask you something?  Sure, honey.  What is it?  Does Aunt Carol have periods?  Yes, Jill.  All women have periods about every four weeks.  But, Dad, men don't have periods, do they?  That's right, honey.  Men do not.  Only women.  Blood from inside a woman's body comes outside from an opening between her legs about every four weeks.  Mr. Black, won't it get on my clothes?  No, it won't, because you use a sanitary pad. 
[02:54:00]  A sanitary pad?  Yes, a sanitary pad.  Susie, what's a sanitary pad?  Come on, Jill.  I'll show you.  I'm having my period now.  Let's go into the bathroom.  She should have asked her black friend what's a sanitary pad.  He would have said, yo, man, that's a clean apartment.  We're going into the silly zone.  Here we go.  Hold on, kids.  Blood comes from your mother's body between her legs when I push her down the stairs. 
[02:54:30]  And you know the whole time the father's answering, the 17-year-old, he's just looking at her head,  picturing how nice a hanger would look at the end of it.  Unfortunately, blood didn't come out of your mother when you were born.  Conceived.  What an idiot I am.  That's right.  You know, it didn't take.  They went with it, though.  Sometimes they just go with it with you.  Big, stupid, hammer-headed sperm cells swimming toward the egg. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, beat up, beat up.  Oh, I beat the whole crew here.  Just clumsily stepping on all the other sperm.  Oh, just caught a wave, pushed it up forward, pushed it in front of everybody.  Well, I'm in the lead.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hey, what's in here?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  The miracle.  Please.  Wonderful.  Want to hear more?  Dopey moe haircut on the sperm. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, big fat tongue hanging out.  Wiggling its way through that egg.  Oh, I made it.  There's some Einstein one just comes in second.  Oh, life.  Fuck it.  That would make a great fucking search.  Yeah.  Life.  Life dot, dot, dot.  And that dumb sperm shows up and the egg is trying to avoid eye contact.  Like, maybe if I just look down, old stupid won't latch on. 
[02:56:00]  Lee's too stupid to figure out how to get in here.  There it is.  And then, years later, you get...  Eh, do you get a period, Dad?  No, you dummy.  No, that's when I disappear for four days.  Yeah.  And go hunting with the boys.  Every four weeks.  Big, dopey, flat-headed sperm.  Oh.  Well, we have more. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, please.  I hope so.  This is a sanitary pad.  This is where I keep them.  Look, it is blue on one side, pride on the other.  That's right.  Right all over.  It also has sticky stuff, like glue on the blue side.  See?  It's sticky.  Do you know why it's sticky?  No.  Sticky so the pad will stick to my panties.  Oof.  How about sticking it over your mouth, stupid?  This is hot.  Yeah.  Jesus.  So it sticks to my panties. 
[02:57:00]  And you know those panties are nothing sexy.  Big, nasty bloomers.  Big, retard underwears.  Thank God we didn't live back then, man.  Thank God.  They're equal size in the front and the back.  You know, that whole equal amount of material.  Where do I stick them?  Well, between the brown and yellow stain.  That's weird.  Sure.  One piece of adhesive goes on the front panel.  Oh, any underwear that has a panel to it.  Lose it. 
[02:57:30]  This sticks on the front panel.  You know?  Yeah, sometimes they put little frilly things on the waistband to make it look sexy.  It ain't working.  Oh, God.  What a mess back then, though.  That's great.  The panties were too big.  The hair down there was making your panties look like you were popping Jiffy Pop popcorn.  Oh.  And then you got this thing that you...  A sanitary belt.  Then you got something that sticks in the whole mess.  Yeah.  So you don't bleed out.  And you're fucking bloomers.  Use this belt.  What?  My pad?  No, to hang your retarded self with.  The inside of a panty smells like Indonesia two weeks after the tsunami. 
[02:58:00]  How do you use it?  I'm having my period now.  I'll show you how I use it.  You mean the blood's coming from inside your body now?  Yes, from the opening between my legs.  This is a used sanitary pad.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  It looks like jelly. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, man, that's brutal.  Look, there's blood on it.  See?  That's right.  Blood coming from inside my body to an opening between my legs.  Look closer.  Closer.  No, closer.  That old gag.  Like a pie.  All right, let me have it.  This is a sanitary napkin, Stanley.  Well, let me have it, Ollie.  Indeed, I will let you have it. 
[02:59:00]  Stanley, get a little closer to the sanitary napkin.  What are you going to do with it, Ollie?  I'm going to let you have it.  But I don't think I want it, Ollie.  You said you want it.  Now I'll give it to you.  Oh. 
[02:59:30]  I hope you enjoyed it, old nut face.  It's that awful.  I got to hear more of that.  Oh, that awful, awful thing she pulled out.  Must have looked like a red slug with skin tags on it.  Oh, my God. 
[03:00:00]  When the pad hits much blood on it, it's a good time to change it.  I'll show you how I change it.  Yeah.  Watch carefully, okay?  See how the pad sticks to my panties?  See?  I fold it over.  Now I wrap it up.  This way it won't make any mess.  Now I put it in the nearest wastebasket.  Like Daddy and Mommy made.  I do not put it in the toilet.  Mess.  I put it in the nearest wastebasket.  Ugh.  Now I take the clean pad.  See? 
[03:00:30]  See, Jill?  Blue.  White.  See?  That's there.  So the pad will stick to panties.  See how it sticks to my panties?  Did she just rip her uterus out?  Yes.  That's all there is to it.  That's all there is to it.  Bingo.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is brutal.  There's a film with this?  How much does she show?  Actually, this came from Nathaniel, right?  Does she show any stingy?  Ah, Nathaniel.  What a find, my friend. 
[03:01:00]  Good job.  Wow.  We love these.  This beats the crap out of the Danny fetus story.  He's flipping me the bird.  Is this online or is this actually a home video?  His sister, Jill.  Oh, God.  That's horrible.  Is it a video?  Yes.  One that I definitely found on my own and was not sent in by a listener.  Oh, okay.  Because I'm better than Danny.  Thank you.  Of course you are.  I would love to see.  Do they show any?  Yeah.  Is the older sister showing the snatch? 
[03:01:30]  No.  Oh, damn it.  She's wearing one of those old long skirt kind of things.  Oh, so she takes her panties off under the skirt and kind of...  Yeah, but I'll let Opie play the next clip, but they do show what they're talking about  in the next clip.  Oh, they do?  Not nothing, no.  When she takes her panties off under the skirt, does it look like the elevator in The  Shining?  Wow.  That old blood fountain gas.  Great trainable, isn't she?  And she's a slow one, huh?  You ripped your wife's panties off and then you left her crumpled in the hallway. 
[03:02:00]  I don't recollect that at all.  I think I should change my sanitary pad.  Oh, and when do you think you should change your sanitary pad?  As soon as possible.  Very good.  Well, the next track...  Yes.  The trainable, uh...  Puts a pad on. 
[03:02:30]  Puts a pad on.  Yes.  I'm looking forward to it.  Now you try it.  Let's pretend you're having your period.  Let's make believe that blood is coming out from inside your body through an opening between  your legs now.  Okay, I'll get a...  A pad.  Look, it's blue on one side and white on the other.  That's right.  It's sticky.  It is sticky.  Yeah.  It's sticky, all right.  Like Daddy's tummy.  It's sticky because it'll stick to your panties.  Are you ready to put it on now?  Yes.  First I put my...  My panties down. 
[03:03:00]  Oh.  Okay, the pad.  Now what do we do?  Peel off the paper.  Right.  Peel off the paper.  Where are you putting it?  The wastebasket.  The wastebasket.  Okay.  Of course.  Now what are you going to do?  I'm sticking it in my panties.  All right, it's down to your panties.  We placed it on there so it's sticky.  Meanwhile, this dummy is bumbling around the bathroom, dripping blood like an Alzar 
[03:03:30]  Cowey beheading video.  Stumbling around with her awful bloomers pulled out of her ankles.  Where's the pad?  Where's the pad?  How old is Jill, Nathaniel?  Am I on?  I'd estimate about 12.  12?  13.  13 just learning about this?  Yeah, dropping trow in this video.  And is she profoundly retarded or is it...  Because she sounds like you could kind of teach her a thing.  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  She's about, you know...  It's down syndrome or is she just a...  She's got a pretty big head.  All right.  I was just wondering what type of mental disability she had.  Is she an actress though?  Playing the part?  What?  Hey, you know...  Julia Lewis was able to pull it off.  You never know.  No, I think she's just a highly trained trainable.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Okay.  Got to go to the phone real fast.  Taylor in VA, Virginia.  Taylor?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Dude, you guys just made me...  You jerk off and made me spray coffee all over my windshield with the fucking... 
[03:04:30]  You know, I'm on my period now.  Let me show you.  Fucking disgusting.  This is the worst.  Is Jimmy sitting there massaging a rod?  No, dude.  I'm packing like a half right now.  Eric wants to know if this is the sexiest state audition.  Eric from Philly.  Very good.  Back to the tape.  Do your panties.  You place it on there so it sticks on, okay?  Okay.  Yes, real good.  I pull my panties up. 
[03:05:00]  Good job, little smucker's leg.  Pull my hands.  I drive my hands.  Now I'm all ready.  It's all ready.  Yeah, I'm all ready.  Jump in front of a bus.  I'm really proud of you.  You wear it for a while for practice and for time.  Practice!  Let's go tell mom and dad for the dance.  She's got to wear it for practice.  What else?  Sick family.  Yeah, this is a little twisted, man.  You know one time, dumbbells, you're going to put it on adhesive side up. 
[03:05:30]  Oh.  It's sticky.  It's going to seal herself up and just save the world a lot of trouble.  You know what you do?  You just wait until they have it in the shower at school and throw tampons at them.  You'll plug it up, plug it up.  This was before tampons, though.  Yeah.  They had to use a lot bigger stuff.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to teach this girl about a tampon.  Well, she's crying in the bathroom.  You just point at it and go, bad girl.  Oh, dirty.  Dirty girl. 
[03:06:00]  Filthy.  That means you're a whore and Jesus hates you.  That's the devil coming out.  What, do you give her a crucifix and put on the exorcist?  You know what you do, stupid.  What else do we have, Opie?  I've got to hear more.  Jill, I have a question for you.  What do you do with the one you take off that has a lot of blood on it?  Fold it over, wrap it up, and put it in the nearest waste gasket.  That's right.  You fold it, wrap it up, and put it in the nearest waste basket. 
[03:06:30]  Now I know all women have periods.  Put it in the waste basket.  That's it.  This guy's in hell.  Fold it up and throw it away.  The whole bathroom smells like a jar of pennies.  Well, Anthony, I got more.  Sorry.  Thanks, Nathaniel.  We've got trainables saying penis and cock.  Oh!  But first, it's a little bit about sex ed.  Sex ed.  Nice. 
[03:07:00]  You've got to train these people.  Yes, Nathaniel?  Sorry.  This whole video, it's like the ABCs of sex for trainables or whatever.  It starts with two minutes of just this trainable walking along a street and a car pulling up, coaxing her into it and driving off.  Was it a Saturn?  So, I guess this is to try to prevent that sort of thing from happening.  Yeah.  Oh, God, is that great.  And it wasn't a trainable.  It was just Voss walking after his car broke down.  And what year would you say these are made? 
[03:07:30]  These are definitely 60s.  Oh, 60s.  Early or late?  It has to be early.  Early 60s are really close to 50s.  Yeah, it has that 50s sound to it.  Yeah, this one might be a little later than the one from before because if you hear the soundtrack, it's just sort of this hippie.  A little groovy?  Like, I believe it was by the Lake Springs.  Great, and then your pad will look like a tie-dyed shirt.  You tool.  Anthony, before we move on with this, we have a trainable talking about satellite radio.  Really?  Yeah, you can train these people. 
[03:08:00]  That's interesting.  You can train people to talk about satellite radio.  Let me hear that.  How happy is Sirius today that we got audio of Howard Stern talking about how great XM is.  They only paid him a half a billion dollars to hear him now talk about XM.  Well, here you go.  A trainable talking about satellite radio.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM satellite radio along for the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.

XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City. 
[03:09:00]  Beyond AM, Beyond FM, it's XM's satellite radio.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no, I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cock right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the X.  That's what they call me. 
[03:09:30]  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  Hey, hey, hey.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the TF thing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite floral treat.  My favorite eating cock.  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock. 
[03:10:00]  That's the right.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Shoot your big wad of cum right into my mouth.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  Oh, God.  After I talk you off, I want you to bang me up the ass.  I'm hungry for a hard male cock. 
[03:10:30]  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, I got a big, juicy cock from Ben the other day.  Oh, I like the banana.  Oh, God.  I like the banana.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy something in my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass.  Hi, hi, hi. 
[03:11:00]  That's what they call me.  Hi, hi, hi.  She's a freak.  Hi, hi, hi.  That's what they call me.  Hi, hi, hi.  She's a freak.  D.C. and Anthony Shaw.  Prepare to be wowed.  What knockers.  Give them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  Go high, bitch.  Just a kiss on the lips.  And I was on my knees. 
[03:11:30]  I'm way down to get mad.  Go high, bitch.  She was shaking her hips.  So that was all that I needed.  Why?  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  If you're looking for a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  All the info is there for you.  It's a great, great thing now that spring is here.  By the way, now that we're back in New York, back from vacation and all that crap. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  We're asking the ladies to stop by our studio here in New York to give us some flashes.  And we're going to post the pictures up on, I guess, rapemywow.com.  Another website that Steve has come up with.  That's right.  And eventually we're going to give out some great, great prizes.  We're just figuring all that out because we just got back from vacation.  But wow is on, man.  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We just have to get great prizes.  That's all.  We'll get a few of them.  Did we give away the MIFIs?  We gave away one to the winner of the eating thing. 
[03:12:30]  What happened to the other one?  Well, we saved the MIFI because we thought a couple was going to have sex in front of Jimmy Norton.  True.  And I did talk to her, by the way, after he called in.  Really?  She's like, yeah, we're waiting for you to call.  She's all worked up.  She sounds all worked up for you, Jimmy.  Well, for just to do it in front, I don't think for me necessarily.  Well, she was saying she would have sex with you and stuff.  I don't know if she would, though.  All right.  That's what the boyfriend was saying.  She was saying, no, they were going to do it for you.  Yeah.  You were just creeped out.  No, I wasn't.  I thought you were creeped out or something. 
[03:13:00]  No, no, no, no.  Just because they're real fans.  I didn't know.  That's what I mean.  That's why you were creeped out a bit.  I just didn't know if they were doing it for the right reasons.  He's more into the casual fan having sex in front of him.  Yeah.  I want to make sure they're doing it for the right reasons.  When they're hardcore fans, then he's a little squirrely about it.  Fucking weirdo.  Because I want...  No shit.  Yeah.  I want them to be doing...  He's got all sorts of fucked up rules that don't make any sense.  I want people to be doing it for the right reasons, not just because...  The right reason was you wanted a MIFI.  That's the right reason. 
[03:13:30]  The right reason is a punch in the mouth.  Good point.  Good point.  That's where it fell in that video.  So we're running out of show and we've got a lot of great audio still to get to here.  Yep.  Britney pregnant.  Who cares?  Just looking at Britney.  Yeah.  Please let it be returned.  Oh my God.  Can you imagine that?  Please let it be.  Please, please, please tape all the entertainment shows tonight because they're going to just  lose their minds over this story.  Absolutely lose their minds.  Pat O'Brien back on TV.  The wacky voice lady is going to be all over the Britney Spears thing. 
[03:14:00]  That's right.  Britney Spears.  Britney pregnant.  Rumor and speculation have been around Hollywood for quite a while now.  And she has announced on her website that she is indeed pregnant.  Britney Spears in the news today.  Speculation over the past couple of months whether Britney Spears is actually pre-wagging him and she is. 
[03:14:30]  She announced it on her own website.  She's pregnant with her husband.  What's his name?  Ken Federline.  Ken Federline.  Club Soda Kenny?  No?  Close.  You know what is great about that?  Because you know this guy is a simpleton.  Yeah.  She's going to get all fucking messed up from the pregnancy and he's going to move right  on.  He was a nobody.  Now he's all over these magazines.  That's all this guy ever wanted. 
[03:15:00]  And now he got Britney pregnant.  They'll have a kid together.  And then he's just going to move on to the next piece of ass.  Let me tell you something.  He left his wife that was pregnant for Britney.  And they already had another kid or something?  This guy's fertile.  This guy's a scumbag.  Fertile Federline.  Britney looks like the type of girl that won't snap back.  She's had some, not problems with the weight or anything, but she's just on that high side  sometimes.  You see her on stage and it's like, it's not quite the Christina Aguilera belly, you know. 
[03:15:30]  She's got some meat to her, the girl.  And now through a pregnancy, I don't see her as the type of girl that'll snap back from  a pregnancy.  Well, the women that snap back, it seems, are the ones that are very disciplined, eat  right during their pregnancy, make sure they don't gain 70, 75 pounds.  Remember when we were growing up, every pregnant woman was like just a monster?  Big mess.  But nowadays, you know, you see these women walking around New York and they only gain  weight in their bellies because they're taking care of themselves, they're exercising 
[03:16:00]  practically right up to the pregnancy, watching every piece of food they throw in their  mouths, right?  But you're right.  Britney Spears, no way.  She's drinking all those frozen Starbucks drinks to begin with, so she doesn't have  much discipline.  So she is, he's going to be the guy that ruined Britney Spears.  The guy that ruined Britney Spears.  And he's just going to, like you said, he'll move on.  That'll deserve a high five.  He'll find someone else.  But yeah.  He'll be in bars and everyone will be high fiving.  I'm like, dude, you were the one.  You know what happens to girls' boobies when they have the kids? 
[03:16:30]  Tell me more.  It just happens.  They go, ew.  Wow, you like when they're destroyed by those little savages gnawing on them?  No, no, no.  That's when it goes back down to the regular size.  I'm talking when they get all swollen.  And full of milk.  And full of yummy goodness.  And you can lay across her lap.  And as you suckle, she can hold your adult head.  You can touch her swollen belly. 
[03:17:00]  That is really rude.  She pets your hair and says it's going to be okay.  Wow, look at the size of those.  They're already getting big.  We're looking at pictures of Britney online.  Wow, she's already getting all sorts of kind of belly fat stuff.  She's got the belly poking out.  She's sitting cross-legged in a chair.  And you can see the meat under the boobs is folding up and resting on her belly.  I like to call those ripple boobs.  Ripple boobs?  Yeah.  I think there's a ripple effect after the boob ends and you see miniature boobs. 
[03:17:30]  Okay, here's before.  Look, before.  Oh, look how hot she is.  After.  My God.  Oh, she's packing it on already.  Wow, she has the under-boob boob.  Yeah.  It is the ripple of fat just under the bikini top when she's sitting down and hunched over  a little.  It could just be the top, though.  It could be a top.  Yeah, it could be.  It could be.  But it's not.  But it's not.  Oh, pregnancy.  Why would you do that? 
[03:18:00]  Why do you have a need?  Sub out a girl's body.  Just sub out another girl.  Have the artificial insemination.  You get your kid, and your chick still has a tight, hot body.  There you go.  Oh, please.  All right.  Oh, he hung up.  Well, Opie, who did?  A guy wanted to know why Howard Stern is advertising XM Satellite Radio.  Because he does what he was told.  What was that?  Mel from Manhattan? 
[03:18:30]  Very funny.  Back to the trainable audio, Anthony?  Oh, absolutely.  I want to hear more of this.  All right.  Where's Nathaniel?  This was his moment in the sun.  He gave up on us.  Believe me, he'll be in before I finish this sentence.  You know, there he is.  There he is.  There he is.  Sense when you say their names.  The 15-second delay doesn't hit the eyes.  Like a spidey sense.  Pavlov's interns.  Back in ye older days, they would just commit these people.  You know, they'd throw them in an institution and let them crap all over themselves. 
[03:19:00]  What, when women got pregnant?  No, no.  Well, they should.  No, the mentally challenged people, Opie.  And then, during the late 50s, early 60s, they started doing this thing where they figured,  you know, they could, what they called mainstreaming.  They could put them into society.  Make them productive members of society.  And one thing, an experience I have with mainstreaming was an elementary school I went to.  It was called mainstreaming?  Opie, it was called mainstreaming.  Yes, they put them back into a society because they realized that they could contribute something 
[03:19:30]  and there were different levels of these mental handicaps and they didn't have to just take  them all and throw them all into an institution.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  There's a little bit about everything.  My, uh, so many complaints about that, by the way, while we were on vacation.  That's the worst song ever.  That thing is not going away.  What song do you mean?  Opie, forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. 
[03:20:00]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  You know, the song is bad enough.  It really is.  But that spit slurp that he does right after Socrates.  What spit slurp?  Listen close.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  You couldn't get through that without drooling, you mental, you, you, ugh.  Socrates.  Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Thank you, Rich Voss, for that song. 
[03:20:30]  You slurping buffoon.  Yes, mainstreaming, Opie.  And when I was a child in elementary school in East Northport, they introduced mainstreaming to my school.  They had a special class of mentally challenged children that went to our school.  But they were in a separate class than ours.  And I was in, I guess, second, third grade, maybe.  But during lunch, that's when they brought him out and we all dined together. 
[03:21:00]  And it was such a treat for the regular kids.  Dude, you just brought back a memory, man.  In my high school, Harborfields High School, there was that section of the school that no one went to.  No one went.  And you had no idea what was going on in that section of the school until lunchtime.  And they paraded those people.  It's the lunchroom.  I'm sitting at the lunch table just trying to choke down a lunch.  And right next to you would plop down a tray.  And there were kids.  And I'm talking like, I'm talking old school retarded, too. 
[03:21:30]  Like 70s retarded.  Not like now retarded where there's tests for these things and they suck them right out.  There was a kid.  Because now, you know, you get retarded kids.  But for the most part, they got a lot of tests for these things, you know.  There was one kid who had water on the brain.  What archaic disease is this?  His head was huge.  And I'm not talking big like, hey, that guy's got a big head.  Hey, you with the base pants.  You got a big fucking head. 
[03:22:00]  Oh!  Not that comedy big head.  His head was huge.  And he had this little pointy chin.  And he couldn't keep it up.  He had a little skinny neck.  He couldn't keep his head up.  Yes, Jimmy?  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm listening.  I'm waiting for the glasses.  And when he got into radio, the producer part comes.  Yes.  We had a tendency.  The teacher would yell out sparks and he would go, ah! 
[03:22:30]  And he couldn't keep his head up.  So it would fall down.  I don't know how I could convey this on radio.  But he'd be sitting there and his head would go, ah!  Like, wrap around.  Like, it would do a circle, whereas his chin would go into his shoulder, middle of his chest,  other shoulder, back up.  That's it.  We'd go, ah!  All day.  He would do this.  And, of course, the really, like, weird teeth, like Clint Howard teeth from the Star Trek episode. 
[03:23:00]  And then drool, lots of drool.  And then another kid that had a horse eye.  You ever see a horse's pupil?  It's wide and fuzzy.  It's like rectangular shape.  I could get into the whole thing of why a horse has different pupils.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony. 
[03:23:30]  I'd like to learn something today, Anthony.  If you will, real fast.  Well, they have different vision than we have.  They could see in the dark a lot better.  And their pupils open up.  They have much better peripheral vision than humans have also.  So, instead of a round pupil, it's a rectangular shaped pupil.  They also have big cocks.  Horse cocks, I hear.  They really do.  And he had this horse eye.  His pupil was all screwed up like that. 
[03:24:00]  And he was another one, like, just drool.  All the drool on their hands.  And you're trying to eat.  And, you know, I'm sorry.  And then there was this kid called Gallagher.  But me and my brother called him Dally Dooley.  Because that's how he said his name.  He'd be like, what's your name?  And he went, Dally Dooley.  Because his name was Gallagher.  And we called him Dally Dooley.  Well, there's a whack bag name that'll be in about five minutes.  How quickly will someone be Dally Dooley on whack bag now? 
[03:24:30]  Welcome to whack bag, Dally Dooley.  And we called him Dally Dooley.  And he would pick his nose constantly.  Constantly picking his nose.  And he was Dally Dooley.  And we'd be like, ew.  We'd be sitting at lunch and go, ew, here comes Dally Dooley.  And we'd run away from Dally Dooley.  He would then sit down and proceed to pick his nose and drool all over everything.  And what a horrible thing.  You know, great for the retarded children that are sitting there and being mainstream. 
[03:25:00]  But how about the poor second graders that are sitting there trying to, you know, adjust to life  that are now getting all these complexes and feeling all weird and not being able to eat comfortably  because Dally Dooley is next to him.  Or Horse Eye Kid.  Or the kid that can't hold his big fat head up.  We had a retarded boy at our school.  He was functional retarded.  But his name was Mark.  And he would always scratch his face and go, ah!  Holy jeez.  And when he ate pizza, you know how you get that awful square pizza?  Mm-hmm.  The first thing he would do, he would just scrape all the cheese off the pizza and then 
[03:25:30]  just eat the red bread.  The crust or whatever.  Yeah, the saucy bread.  He used to hate when you'd blow on his face.  So what did you do relentlessly?  Hey, Mark.  Both hands scratching his dumb cheeks.  Oh, that's great.  Unbelievable.  They weed all these out now.  Yep.  Sure, you see an occasional Down syndrome.  But can't they test for that now, too?  Yeah, I think sooner or later.  But I think the people that have them now are people that are like, well, we don't care. 
[03:26:00]  We're having a child.  But I think they test for it.  Mm-hmm.  Because you really don't see as many mentally challenged and physically challenged like that  people as you used to.  I mean, we were going to school.  We got them thalidomide babies.  Flipper kids.  How the hell are you going to learn math when you got a flipper kid right there?  It's impossible.  You're just trying to wonder how they hold the pencil.  How the hell is he holding that pencil?  Can you make that noise again, Jimmy?  You're bothering me! 
[03:26:30]  Oh, he hated that.  What was he, Luke Costello?  Right in his dumb face.  You're bothering me!  That's what he would say.  Stop bothering me.  He's blowing in my...  Stop blowing in my...  He's blowing in my...  He's blowing in my...  Here comes Dolly Dolly Abbott! 
[03:27:00]  Dolly Dolly!  Jesus.  All right.  Do we have time to get into the sex ed trainable audio stuff?  I would love to hear at least a little sample.  All right.  Nathaniel brought this in.  It's the ABCs of teaching a trainable about sex ed, right?  Yes.  Let's go with the first clip here.  Sex education for trainables? 
[03:27:30]  Is it possible?  Or is it even necessary?  Well, let's start with the last question first.  Why necessary?  Well, we must teach those with serious disabilities that hinder their learning  to live as successfully as possible with other people.  There you go.  Now, this includes their sexual behavior.  But rather than teach, which is somewhat difficult,  it becomes a training situation  with as much explanation as they can absorb. 
[03:28:00]  And is it possible?  Well, through training,  they will realize who they are as men and women  and what is expected of them in social situations.  Sex education for the trainables should be made as simple as ABC.  A, awareness of their bodies and their feelings.  B, understanding the simple mechanics of reproduction.  And C, training in responsibilities and appropriate social behavior. 
[03:28:30]  Here you say a trainable, put it in and pull it out.  If it looks like a fudgical, you did it wrong, stupid.  What was that horrible?  Let me move right on to the next track.  Yeah, let's give it a listen.  So, let's start with A.  What should they learn about their bodies as much as they can? 
[03:29:00]  Now, the ideal situation is a one-to-one basis.  But if this is not possible,  the group should be kept very small  and include only those who will pay attention.  Those who teach must do some special examination  of how they themselves feel about sex.  That's great.  Only those who will pay attention.  The rest should be executed. 
[03:29:30]  Turn them over to Dr. Mengele  and allow him to learn what he can.  The boxcar pulls up to a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  Well, that was the beginnings of the whole thing.  Maybe not very sympathetic,  but I guess it paved the way, Opie.  Well, this next track, it's just priceless.  Room full of genetic embarrassments.  Penis. 
[03:30:00]  Say penis.  Penis.  Louder.  Penis.  Give me another word for penis.  Prick.  Prick.  Peter.  Peter.  Car.  Mmm.  Daddy's snack.  Rod.  Rod.  Dick.  Dick.  Prick.  Prick.  We've got it.  Me.  What?  Me?  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  Ding dong. 
[03:30:30]  Ron.  Ron.  General.  Talking about in using sexual terminology  is difficult for many people  because of the guilt and embarrassment  from our heritage.  Guilt and embarrassment of the kids?  Prick.  Prick.  Peter.  Cop.  Rod.  Dick.  Meat.  Ding dong.  Wand. 
[03:31:00]  Wiener.  Fool.  Joint.  wasn't that the last  XM meeting we were at in Washington  sounds like it  wow  they should be reciting that  in a room that they're expecting  a shower to come out of  and little pellets  ding dong  wiener  oh god  man 
[03:31:30]  it's amazing  ding dong  just one lousy chromosome  Sandy  we're going to talk again  about the parts of your body  okay  and the fact that a girl  has three holes between her legs  three  how many Sandy?  three  but I was  major Nelson  three holes  three  stop with that third hole  stop  it's just two 
[03:32:00]  what can that third one do  for me  nothing  what is the third one?  you like the third one the best  there's only two holes alright  I know  that third one  they took it  come on  it's like you know  a hole within a hole  who's counting?  one hole and two snack dispensers  it's good to be back in New York  okay now let's look at this picture  okay 
[03:32:30]  you see that  this hole here  is the hole where you make a BM  and it's called your rectum  what is it?  a BM  what year is this?  this is where you make a BM  she doesn't even understand what that is  yeah  Bavarian motor  and this hole here  is the hole  from which you pee  when you go to the bathroom  or urinate  yes  what else would you use it for? 
[03:33:00]  well that's just used to urinate  no it's not  she used to menstruate too  no  that's the mother hole  and we'll talk about that  dummy smacker  because there's three holes here  now you show me  what I showed you  this one is hovering over  Jimmy Norton's face  oh god  next  this is the hole you make a BM from  and this hole in between the two  that's called your vagina  yes 
[03:33:30]  and that's the hole from which you menstruate  this is your only redeeming quality  I'll repeat if possible  to show that the lesson is being understood  what a nightmare  this is the hole you make a BM from  this is the hole you pee from  and this is the hole that protects you from being beheaded at birth  this is the hole that gives men any reason to talk to you  without this hole you'd be considered plant life  oh is that awful 
[03:34:00]  oh and she wasn't getting it  it's three holes  and the teacher lost her  she can't get it  the teacher lost her voice  oh what a nightmare for the teacher  what not menstruate  no you idiot  jeez  teacher has that awful Philly accent  here's your one hole you put this in  and this is your other hole to pee out of  how bad does this woman do on her SATs that she's doing this
