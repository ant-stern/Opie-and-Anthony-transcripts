<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a polygraph test administered to intern Derek by expert Daniel Ribakoff.  The test, punctuated by banter and jokes from the hosts and Ribakoff, covered Derek's online activity, past robberies, and racial views.  The results of the test were not fully detailed.  The discussion then shifted to Anthony's brother, Joe, sharing his successful deception of a polygraph decades prior, followed by an analysis of another guest, Derrick's polygraph results, revealing both truthful and deceptive answers regarding robberies and racist tweets. Polygraph examiner, Love Buzz, was questioned about his investigation into Derrick's tweets.  The hosts also used implied polygraph techniques on producer Steve, questioning his sexual orientation.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a heated and highly charged discussion about mental illness, focusing on the experiences of callers and the hosts’ personal anecdotes regarding family members suffering from conditions like bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. Callers, including one identifying as "Cunt Cancer," shared their frustrations, anger, and empathy, often employing highly offensive language.

The broadcast then transitioned to a behind-the-scenes look at the production of the show's "We Are the World" parody, playing raw audio tracks featuring Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and various recurring characters like Mustard, Bobo, and Gray Wolf. The segment highlighted the chaotic recording process and the difficulties of mixing the audio, focusing on Gray Wolf's imperfect contribution.  Listener calls further emphasized the theme of mental illness, with one caller recounting a family member's attempted murder stemming from depression, and another detailing the impact of their grandmother's bipolar disorder.

The show moved on to discuss a short film produced by Opie and Anthony, with Joe DeRosa, Bill Burr, and Bobby Kelly (present in studio) involved.  The film, featuring Colin Quinn, Bonnie, Jessica ("the girl from the hallway"), and Rich Voss, sparked a heated argument about Jim Norton’s exclusion.  DeRosa and Kelly argued over who was to blame, with Burr attempting to mediate via phone.  Listeners were encouraged to tweet their displeasure, resulting in numerous vulgar tweets being read on air.

The final segment began with a discussion about the Apollo missions and the challenges of space toilets, which devolved into highly explicit conversations about bodily functions in zero gravity,  including speculation on colonic procedures and the desire for sex in zero gravity. Jim Norton recounted his vomit-filled, near-nude, zero-gravity striptease attempt,  while detailing his attempts to proposition a female test pilot.  This was followed by a discussion of leaked Mel Gibson audio tapes featuring highly offensive language, with Patrice O’Neal (in studio) analyzing the power dynamics.  The show ended with further discussion of the tapes and a brief return to the zero-gravity topic.  Throughout the entire broadcast, numerous commercial breaks and mentions of upcoming guests, including Russell Peters, were interspersed.

[00:06:00]  I just don't like vegetables.  I can't imagine what it's like for the people that don't eat their fruits and vegetables like I do every day.  I eat very unhealthy.  I eat a lot of burgers, fried stuff.  That's what I always crave.  You know, I'm 6'4", and I weighed about probably 335 pounds.  I got on the superfood, and within the first three or four days, what I started craving was the healthy food.  A couple weeks later, I was down to about 315.  As of today, 270 pounds.  So I've lost about 65 pounds in just a tad under 90 days.  That's amazing.  It really is.  TexasSuperfood.com.

[00:10:00]  Sorry, Mr. North Horse.  No, please.  No offense taken.  No offense taken.  Oh, is this the room?  The guy is very cool and calm.  You still use more brain resources to make up a life.  What are they talking about in there?  I think it's the science gun.  Who's he talking to?  Himself.  Talking to the other guy's cock.  He's talking to the machine.  Hi, you're my friend. 
[00:10:30]  Hello, Joshua.  Hi, Detective Joshua.  All right, get him in there.  Okay.  Unplug the goddamn thing.  Get him in there.  Who's he talking to?  Please tell me he's by himself in there.  Just rambling on.  Like fucking private pile in a full metal jacket.  Oh, yeah.  The truth is easy.  Great if he just starts blurting out the worst racist stuff ever.  Gotcha. 
[00:11:00]  Sam going in?  Yeah, he just told them we're getting him.  Right.  There's Derek.  Oh, my God.  It's like he's being executed.  Look at him.  Yeah.  All right.  It's time.  I know.  I could say he looks like a relief pitcher.  It's like a finisher.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is he talking to himself in there?  No, he's got another guy with him.  Oh, okay.  Oh, he does?  Lovers?  I guess so.  Yeah.  All right.  Derek's entering the room.  This is Derek.  Hey, Derek.  I'm Dan. 
[00:11:30]  How you doing?  Nice to meet you.  How are you?  This is Jason, my assistant.  This is Jason.  How are you, buddy?  Good, good.  So why don't you grab a seat over there?  I'll leave you guys.  Perfect.  Thanks.  This is never good.  All right, so I can't really see you too well, so I'm going to come around here so we  can chat for a little while.  Friendly, casual.  Yeah.  You know why you're here?  Being a lie detector test.  You're going to take a polygraph test today.  Yes, I'm going to take a polygraph.  Okay, good.  So that good nature thing is all part of a ploy.  Oh, yeah.  18.  18.  Okay.  You in school or what are you doing?  I'm in college, yeah.  In college, okay.  Where do you go? 
[00:12:00]  Kingsborough Community College.  He's already going.  Okay, sure.  On his way in.  I go, you ready for your lie detector test?  Come on, let's go.  That's good.  All right, so.  So, polygraph's the perfect thing for you to learn.  What do you mean?  I don't know about polygraph.  I know about polygraph.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  Okay.  I know it's inconclusive in court most of the time.  Not true.  What happens is it's been a polygraph for almost 100 years.  So polygraphs today are admitted in court itself.  Dummy.  In 20 states.  Wow.  In New York, and also federal court, they're admitted. 
[00:12:30]  Also admitted in immigration court.  They're allowed in New York State court?  No, in New York State, they don't utilize them in the courtroom, but they use them to  adjudicate issues outside of the courtroom.  So I'll give you a quick example.  You said Jew.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Kid was on a bus.  Gets robbed.  Black guy did.  Gets grabbed from behind as he's getting off the bus.  Somebody punches him in the face, and they take a sidekick.  So the cops come on the bus, and they go, I think the kid that robbed you.  I couldn't see. 
[00:13:00]  He says, all I know is a kid with a Yankee-fitted hat and a black bubble jacket.  Well, like 14 kids on the bus had the same thing, because all he could see was when he  turned around.  So the cop go, is this the kid?  He goes, I don't know, it could be.  He goes, you get off the bus.  He goes, is this the kid?  He goes, I could be.  Also, he goes, get off the bus.  And you take three kids, and they arrest all three.  Meanwhile, the kids didn't even have the sidekick.  So Grandma brings him to me.  I do a polygraph on the kid.  The kid passes.  I gave it to the DA.  The DA drops the charges on the kid.  I've had kids arrested for selling drugs to cops, and they say, well, you know what? 
[00:13:30]  We don't really think he sold the drugs.  We think the cop does not tell them the truth.  So we get people out of trouble.  Let me put it this way.  All right.  You go into a Dunkin' Donuts, and they have you on video, and your fingerprint's on the  counter, and you're robbing the store, you don't get the polygraph.  But you are getting a polygraph if it's questionable.  That's the way she works.  They use it to get rid of any doubt.  To rule out, right, exactly.  Right, all right.  So I've gotten people out of Riker's Island.  I'm an expert in criminal and Supreme Court, because I test for the district attorney. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, so you know your stuff.  Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, I mean, I've been a private investigator for 20 years.  The polygraph examiner I do for one of the NBC shows, the Steve Wilkos show.  Have you ever seen Steve Wilkos?  Boo.  Okay, so, um, criminal stuff there, murders, rapes, probably used to have that.  So the polygraph basically tells me what part of your brain you're utilizing when you  tell the truth and when you lie.  Have a brain? 
[00:14:30]  We know that by the advent of MRIs.  It's a dolt.  So if I stick your head in the MRI, and I go, is your name?  How about I stick your fucking head to that MRI?  This part of your brain is going to activate it.  This is a long-term mission.  B-O-O.  B-O-O.  How do you know you go to Queensborough Community College, by the way?  How do I know?  I just know.  It's in your memory.  It's in my memory.  Right, exactly.  How do you know to come to work here?  It's in my memory.  It's in my memory.  So everything that you know is where?  In your memory.  It's the hard drive of your computer.  Your brain does a hundred trillion calculations per second. 
[00:15:00]  Well, not his.  His test four.  Yeah.  Right?  Poorly.  He's got an old 486 brain.  Eat, sleep, talk, lie.  When you lie, you use the area just above your eye sockets in the prefrontal cortex.  He's got a little Commodore 64 in his head.  Yeah.  A dot-prompt idiot.  You say, you know, I was born on Mars and space aliens flew me in here.  That's not your memory.  Are you utilizing the, if you look left, you're telling the truth. 
[00:15:30]  If you look right, you're seeing the story.  I hate how he's trying to sound like he's the investigator, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He has no visualization.  Stop.  You know, it's not a hundred percent accurate.  Because people can control that, right?  I can question you and you can just stare right into my eyes.  So you can control that.  Look into my eye.  He really is.  Yeah.  I'm testing the mechanical part of your brain.  So when you lie, you must use your imagination.  You want to deal with this guy?  Now, giving information.  He's letting you know that you can't lie to him. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much it.  Two different levels of work for your brain.  It's easier for you to write a biography about yourself than it is to write a fiction story.  Because you have to create that fiction story.  Not him.  He's a fucking liar.  So when you use this part of your brain, you use what's known as more cognitive resources.  You're thinking of the lie.  You're making up the lie.  You're calculating the lie.  So you need more energy.  Almost like when your computer...  Yeah, that's fucking...  I hate the way this kid is trying to sound like it's just two equals discussing technique. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That's what he's doing.  More oxygen.  Men of similar ilk.  Yeah.  Just talking about lie detectors.  Two crime catchers.  Yeah.  Jordan writes...  Oh, Jesus.  He's giving him a fucking neurology course.  Just ask him if he hates the Negroes, will you?  Exactly.  Derek is accessing his memory.  I'm going to ask you questions that are meant to activate the frontal cortex.  Activate.  Great.  So I'm going to ask you questions...  Activate the frontal cortex with a bullet. 
[00:17:00]  Now I know what happens to Derek when he lies.  Then I'm going to ask you questions that are unknown.  Say it's a bank robbery, right?  Did you rob the bank?  No.  True.  Do you know who robbed the bank?  No.  A black guy.  You didn't rob the bank, but you know Jason robbed it, and you don't want to be a snitch.  So it becomes almost like a reflex comparison test.  It's pretty interesting.  Yeah.  No, it is.  It is.  No, it's not.  Oh, he agrees, of course.  It is.  It is.  A fellow investigator agrees.  I've often thought it's interesting.  On their website, for $115,000 a year. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  So it's an interesting science.  The federal government alone has 600 polygraph examiners on it.  Pat yourself on the back.  Exactly.  Steve Wilkos.  We get it.  Actually, he did Oprah.  It's a big...  It's a big field.  It's a big field, yeah.  Yeah, a big field.  Yeah, a big field.  He just repeats what the other guy said, like he was coming to that conclusion.  He's so bad.  Everybody knows the law.  I hate this.  It's a dead end road.  Dead end road. 
[00:18:00]  It's a dead end road.  Yeah, I think so.  We don't even need to do this.  It's like, your brain is like a hard drive.  It's like a hard drive.  Yeah.  Brain, anything like that.  I have anxiety.  Anxiety, okay.  Do you take any meds for your anxiety?  I'm supposed to.  Okay, but you're not.  I'm meds, right?  Okay.  I'm not a meds.  Oh.  And I also suffer from a panic attack.  I get panic attacks.  Oh, okay.  So you have pretty much similar to you.  Oh, nice.  You feeling okay today?  I'm feeling fine.  I haven't had one in a year.  Okay, got it.  A year?  He's due.  Yeah.  I could so just bring him on. 
[00:18:30]  Of course.  Definitely.  I could talk to him and bring him on.  So, thank God he's not a murder.  Yeah, I'm not on trial for murder.  Exactly.  Just repeat everything.  Stop repeating everything.  Just repeat it.  Your criminal justice, desire.  It's a great thing to be subjected to it.  Subjected.  So, let me.  Let's let you.  Are you tired?  Have you had a good night's sleep?  Let me bring my things on.  I had a half a sandwich.  I didn't get much sleep.  Because I got out of work at about 12, 45 minutes.  Boring.  Oh, okay.  Got you.  And were you robbed on the way home?  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  You liar.  All right.  Here we go.  So, let me review some of the questions.  The issue that they've told me is that on your blogs or Twitters, there've been some racial  style remarks.  So, you attribute that to what?  Like that?  The fact that you've been robbed before or assaulted before primarily by racial types.  By African Americans or Hispanics or anything along those lines. 
[00:19:30]  There's another word you could use.  Yes.  So, tell me a little bit about those experiences, you know, just in brief.  In brief, it was just, I always ended up walking and I always ended up, you know, walking in the trouble.  Getting jumped.  Getting jumped, getting robbed.  Okay.  Knives, cut my face, things like that.  Yeah.  How many times would you say that you've been robbed?  See, I really, I really, never really counted.  Oh.  I always gave it around about 40.  40.  Wow.  That's a lot.  Okay.  Have all those incidents been reported to the police?  Funny if this guy robbed them.  My dad made me report like the first few and then I just stopped telling him. 
[00:20:00]  Okay.  Because he was a, he's in law enforcement.  Oh, is he?  Oh, okay.  Oh, very good.  What branch is he in?  He's on Rikers Island.  Oh, okay.  He's a correctional officer.  Yes.  I go to Rikers a lot.  I didn't do a lot of tests up there.  Yeah, he's in George Marchand.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I've been there.  I've been there.  So, I have my Rikers Pass, as a matter of fact.  I've got to get it renewed.  You two can bond over a glory hole.  Don't tell me if they're accurate and fair.  We always review questions about what we're going to ask you on the polygraph to make sure 
[00:20:30]  you understand them and to make sure that it's fair.  Okay, that's fine.  That's fine.  If you once have your iPod stolen.  No.  Okay.  It was an attempted robbery.  Oh, okay.  They didn't get it.  But they didn't get the iPod.  They didn't get it, no.  Okay, so let's change the question.  Uh-huh.  There you go.  During an attempted robbery, was your iPod a target?  I killed a hooker.  He just blurts out a confession of a hard crime. 
[00:21:00]  During the robbery, they wanted your iPod, maybe something else, or maybe they tried to  take something else, but...  It was probably...  They just tried to take an iPod, and then I ran, so I didn't know if they wanted anything  else.  Gotcha.  Okay, so the iPod was the target of it.  Have you ever worked for your uncle as a receptionist doing mortgages?  Yes.  Okay.  Did a man cut you with a box cutter in an attempted robbery?  Yes. 
[00:21:30]  Okay.  Mr. Anderson.  Yeah.  A kid your age or...  Teen.  A teen.  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you help your landlady take out her garbage?  Yes.  Were you hit with a pipe in an attempted robbery?  Yes.  Okay.  So these are events that you clearly remember, correct?  Yes.  You can see them in your head.  Oh, definitely.  Okay.  What's the issue with scars on your chest?  I saw...  I thought there were scars on my chest.  They were like discolorations, I guess.  As I got older, I guess they might have disappeared as a skin stretched and all that... 
[00:22:00]  Oh, good.  ...all that jazz.  Thanks, Doc.  So they're not scars on your chest from the tax, correct?  No.  There's not scars there.  Gotcha.  Oh.  He lied yesterday.  He flat out lied yesterday.  Do you consider yourself racist?  Yes.  Okay.  Do you pretend you're racist for attention?  No.  Okay.  That's a lie.  Were you twittering racial remarks before your internship?  Yes.  Okay.  And how long have you been an intern here? 
[00:22:30]  I started two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago.  Okay.  So you were recent then.  Yes.  Okay.  You like it so far?  Oh, it's awesome.  Yeah?  You're doing?  Look, they got me doing a lie detector test.  Yeah, exactly.  Right?  Yeah.  Two bodies just bobbing.  They're just yucking it up.  Exactly.  I hate these two.  Have you been robbed approximately 40 times?  Yes.  Including attempted robbery?  Yes.  I wish the ceiling caved in in that room.  I mean, you see, it's more than 10.  Definitely more than 10.  I know.  We're still doing this in the Haitian parliament a year ago. 
[00:23:00]  Hey.  What?  What does that sound?  The vavuzula.  I just nodded it to 40 because that's...  Right.  Okay.  So I want to make sure that you can say to me, Dan, you know what?  It's definitely more than 20 times.  It's definitely more than 20 times.  No, I've definitely been in more than 20 situations like that.  More than 20.  Definitely.  That's why I want to make sure that it's accurate because sometimes people go, you know, it was  40 times and when you count them out, you go, well, maybe more than 20.  But listen, 20 is a lot.  It's like, yeah, it's like, oh, something happened.  Oh, yeah.  I've done this 150 times. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  I caught a fish that was 300 pounds.  You know, it was 80.  It's still a big fish, right?  Yeah.  Big fish.  So you think more than 20 times.  No, definitely more than 20 times.  Okay.  20 times.  Okay.  Now, what's your ethnic background?  My family comes from Malta.  Okay.  My grandmother is also from India.  Okay.  What a wreck.  And my mother's side of the family is, they're German Jews. 
[00:24:00]  German Jews.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Christ.  Weird.  Some fancy stuff.  They all fucked in a hostel.  So you're not Hispanic?  No.  Self-hatred going on there.  Are you unhappy that you aren't pure Caucasian?  Yes.  Yes?  Okay.  Oh, a little self-hatred.  So you would have preferred to have been pure Caucasian?  Yes.  Okay.  Did you ever take a bus home at 3 a.m. when you were 14?  Yes.  Okay.  Was that during one of the times that you were assaulted? 
[00:24:30]  Yes.  Okay.  Of the times that you...  He breaks the windows of his own business.  How many times have black men been the same on that one?  99% of the time.  Yeah?  Okay.  Yes.  And the other percentage?  White kids?  A few times they were Hispanic gentlemen.  Probably I would say Puerto Rican.  Okay.  So you think that...  Puerto Rican.  Probably almost all of your robberies, 99% of them...  Yes.  Were by black.  Perpetited by black gentlemen. 
[00:25:00]  Yes.  Perpetited.  Where do you live?  What part of the city?  I live in Staten Island.  Oh, you live in Staten Island?  Yes.  Gotcha.  Is your area primarily white, primarily black?  It's white and a little Hispanic.  Hispanic.  Okay.  And do you travel through black areas or...?  Depending on where I'm going, yeah.  Okay.  Public transportation mostly?  Used to.  Now I drive, so I don't have that problem anymore.  Okay.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Okay.  Are you particularly afraid of black people? 
[00:25:30]  I'm afraid of the ghetto type of...  The ghetto type of...  Yes.  Okay.  So, urban guys.  So let me...  If you saw a black guy in a business suit with a briefcase...  No issue, right?  No issue.  If you saw a guy with a hoodie and a baseball bat...  Make him return that to the store.  You'd be more cautious.  Yeah, I'd go to the store.  Okay.  Gotcha.  Okay.  So I'm not afraid of all black people, but obviously more cautious because of your experiences.  Okay.  Do you think you're superior to black people?  No.  Okay.  Why?  No problem.  Okay.  So...  He said he wanted to be white.  Not all of those questions are going to be asked on the polygraph, but I just wanted 
[00:26:00]  to sort of...  No, that's understandable.  We just want to get a little background.  All right.  Good.  They aren't even asking any questions yet.  I'm fine.  So let me ask you a question here.  Might be trickery on his part.  Who knows?  Yeah.  This week, have you ever lied to get out of serious trouble?  What do you mean by lied to get out of serious trouble?  You know what he means?  Stalling?  Yeah.  I lied to get out of serious trouble.  Have you ever lied?  I was a kid.  Okay.  Broke a window and I was like, I didn't do it.  Oh, I hate him.  Between the ages of 15 and 17.  Broke a window?  What is it? 
[00:26:30]  Dennis the Menace?  What did you do, you little fuck?  I think criminal is it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Did you ever steal anything that did not belong to you?  No.  That's such a, like, 1950s fucking...  Did you ever knock mom's vase off the shelf?  Did you ever knock mom's vase off the shelf?  The colostomy bag you were swinging? 
[00:27:00]  A couple of sensors.  Okay.  And...  Oh, here we go.  Essentially, you're going to monitor your breathing with two rubber bands.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, shit.  Welcome up to a taser.  And we're going to have two sensors on your fingers.  And two on your balls that I will put on with my tongue.  And one in your anus that my assistant will admit to me that has anxiety of...  Wherever you lie, his penis from.  But what happens is the beauty of the polygraph is a customized test.  Where Jason may be very cool, calm, and... 
[00:27:30]  He's your ass for, like, a milky machine.  He may be guilty of a murder, but he doesn't really care.  Where you may be anxious and you haven't done anything.  But what happens is your anxiety becomes your baseline.  Ah.  Where his coolness becomes his baseline.  But when you lie, there's still the acceleration of your physiology over and above your rings.  Right.  Oh, no, definitely.  Oh, no, definitely.  I was just going to say, watch him agree.  People go, I was nervous.  That's why I felt.  I hate this kid.  Because nervousness and lying are two different signals to the polygraph.  It's a boob. 
[00:28:00]  So what I'm going to do is I'll hook you up.  You'll hook me up.  I'll do a little test where it's...  Okay, like I just showed you.  I mean, my...  Your palms are normally sweating.  My palms are always sweating.  That's normal for a lot of people.  Oh, there's an electrical cord.  That's normal.  That's normal for liars.  Of course.  This lying sack of shit.  Exactly.  Fucking greasy palms mongrel.  Look at him.  In the city?  Or private? 
[00:28:30]  No, not private.  I was thinking either like Detective Homicide to NYPD, but it's a very long waiting list.  That's probably like quarter to 30 or something.  Okay.  Just trying to relate to the guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is there good opportunities out there?  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  No.  I never really bothered him.  The guy said, just relax.  This might make you cum.  My dad's mother didn't teach you the language.  So when she told dad about you...  Yes, then you don't know.  Yeah, then he don't know.  Exactly. 
[00:29:00]  We should have set him up with that.  Get a fake eye there.  That's the bit.  Fuck.  She's basically...  A rubber band-like device.  So when you breathe, it sends me a signal.  Trying to convince him that it's all normal.  That just starts unzipping his fly.  Hilarious.  See how far he can get before the kid freaks out.  It's like, no, this is all part of it.  This is conductor fluid.  I have to tongue the tip of your weenie.  Yes.  Here, let me just put a little salt in your piss. 
[00:29:30]  Let's do that.  You monitor at the chest level.  And at the diaphragm level.  At the diaphragm level.  Exactly.  It's a bit slit.  Oh, fuck.  Good.  All right, here we go.  I think.  A blood pressure cuff.  Similar to the one that...  Actually, identical to the one the doctor uses,  but it's not as tight.  Huh.  It may make your arm a little tingly during a polygraph,  but we only keep you on it for about three minutes  before we...  What pressure? 
[00:30:00]  He used to give you a minute to rest,  and then another chest.  Brian from Quincy, Illinois, Anthony.  Exactly.  This guy's technique is called water boring.  Water boring.  He's good, though.  This guy, he has an answer for everything.  Yeah.  He's good as...  Fuck.  These are going to monitor.  He worked for Lloyd's of London.  His resume is pretty impressive.  We're going to talk to the guy in studio after this is done.  You have about two million sweat glands in your body  that are tubes that fill up and retract.  Yeah, I hear it now.  Yeah.  Mr. Anderson.  Mr. Anderson.  Filling.  So any time you move a major muscle group, 
[00:30:30]  your sweat glands will activate to cool you off.  So what I want you to do when I test you, Derek,  is I want you to look straight ahead sort of at this area here  and to answer with your mouth only.  Almost like taking an x-ray,  you want to be a robot and your lips just move to go,  yes or no,  without moving your neck muscles.  Yes.  Okay, so don't move my neck muscles.  The only thing you're going to move is you can blink  and you can move your mouth to say yes or no.  I hope you don't have a gag reflex.  So stay loud enough so I can hear you through the screens, 
[00:31:00]  but you don't have to scream it yes or no  so that you're going to affect your body.  No problem.  Okay, so let me just do this.  And what we're going to do is we're going to do an acquaintance test.  Hello, Paul.  I'm going to ask you several questions  that I want you to answer no to.  The reason I'm going to make you answer no  is I'm going to make you a lie  and I'm going to make you tell the truth.  How am I going to do that?  When you answer no,  for example, I may ask you,  is your name Anthony? 
[00:31:30]  No.  So that's the truth.  Is your last name Rodriguez?  No.  So that's a lie.  So I'm going to force you to tell me the truth  and tell me a lie  so I can know how you react  and you can practice taking a problem.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He agrees with everything.  Like he knows.  All right, so.  This is going to be the practice test  where you get to practice sitting still to relax.  Practice sitting still.  It's like a child.  Just breathe nice and even.  Don't hold your breath.  Don't take any deep breaths. 
[00:32:00]  It would be so bad if you were really guilty  of something really bad.  You're just like, I'm so fucked.  Ready for the practice test?  Okay, good.  When you feel the blood pressure cuff inflate,  we'll be getting very close to the test.  Oh, boy.  I'm just making some adjustments to the instrument now.  He's grabbing his dick.  Yeah.  Adjust that instrument.  Just peel the skin back on this instrument.  Smell it.  Smells like monster cheese. 
[00:32:30]  All right, Grace,  you feel the blood pressure cuff inflate.  Swarthy Mediterranean boy.  Got the blood pressure cuff around his ball bag.  I would ask you to answer no  by moving your lips only  for the practice test.  No matter what question I ask you,  please answer no.  And the practice test has begun.  Getting a reading, I guess.  Are you now in San Francisco?  No. 
[00:33:00]  Someone is saying who knows about this shit?  Yeah.  That the test is already half over.  Yeah.  All that shit was part of the test.  Are you a student in New York University?  No.  People listening to questions here.  Are you thinking about my cock?  How did your parents die?  Are you a tattletale?  How did your parents die? 
[00:33:30]  Get the fuck out now.  Do you have an erection?  In Staten Island.  No.  If I called my penis Mr. Eel,  would you kiss it?  One, your brain is working.  Is it safe?  Do you know what your parents tell you?  That's from Unato.  Tell me the test that it's working.  Oh, that is great.  He pulls out dental tools  and starts drilling his teeth.  You are reacting. 
[00:34:00]  It's insane.  Fucking bad.  And what we're going to do now  is we're going to do  one chart  where we're going to  ask you some of the questions  that we reviewed.  Do you suck, Nick?  As well as other questions  where we're going to ask you  are you sitting down?  Is your name Derek?  So on and so forth  so we can test  what part of your brain  you're answering with.  Okay.  Okay.  Any questions for me, Derek? 
[00:34:30]  No.  Okay.  No.  Pretty much explained it very well.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  That's good.  Remember, in a polygraph  you can't lie a little  because the only thing  that I can see  is that you've activated  the part of your brain  that lies.  So everything  that we've discussed  has been truthful.  You've been robbed  more than 20 times  or attempted.  When I say robbed  I mean robbed  or attempted robbery.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  20 times.  Your iPod was the target  of an attempted robbery. 
[00:35:00]  Correct?  Do you remember that?  Yes.  Okay, good.  So.  Great.  All right.  Ready for the first chart?  Just hold on.  I want to ask you  a bunch of questions  and I want to have them  answered immediately.  Oh, gotcha.  Okay.  Who is your daddy  and what does he do?  All right.  I'm all ready.  All right, Derek.  Quiet.  Here we go.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Okay, so the test has begun. 
[00:35:30]  Please answer truthfully  all of the questions  with your mouth only.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I know.  Do you live  in the state of New York?  Yes.  Is this the month of June?  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:36:00]  Looking at the test,  I'm sure.  Do you intend  to lie to me  on any of the questions  on this test?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Why not? 
[00:36:30]  Have you been robbed  more than 20 times?  Yes.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Was your iPod  once the target  of an attempted robbery?  What are you doing  in my house?  Is this the year 2010? 
[00:37:00]  Yes.  Do you want to kiss me, or?  Did a male cut you  with a box cutter  in an attempted robbery?  Get the fuck out, now.  Yes.  Yes.  Where you hit with a pipe 
[00:37:30]  during an attempted robbery?  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Yes.  Are you sitting down now?  Yes.  No, I'm kneeling.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro. 
[00:38:00]  Well, before this week, did you ever take anything that did not belong to you that you did not return?  Goddamn rich cunt!  I kill rich cunt!  Yes, I took cum from my man's balls.  I stole it.  While he slept. 
[00:38:30]  Relax.  That's the first chart.  How's the arm doing?  I understand.  Yeah?  Good.  First chart.  Give me a minute just to relax.  Relax.  Get the arm.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  Didn't pardon him for long, did he?  No.  Oh.  Was not satisfied with the pardoning.  Of course.  Killing people.  He's a fag! 
[00:39:00]  Okay, so.  Let me know when you're ready for the second chart.  Of course there's something wrong with him.  He's a Negro.  Is that camera videotaping there?  Um, I don't know.  That's a very good question.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  He's a very observant boy.  Doesn't look like it. 
[00:39:30]  No, may not be honest.  Okay, so looking straight ahead, Derek.  He's not a very bright bulb.  Answering yes or no.  Uh-huh.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Hello.  Hello.  Do you live in Staten Island?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Test has begun.  Hello.  Do you live in Staten Island?  Yes.  Now lick my sweaty balls.

[00:52:30]  which is the set uh second largest recovery of cash in united states history from an armored truck  loss you should get a percentage of that i wish but uh hey that's that's i'm happy if they pay my  bills you know oh really yeah i hear you so they do so you talk to derek the intern yeah derek  the intern what's your well without giving away anything what's your general thoughts on the  impression of yes seems like a nice kid he's got his head screwed on straight but he's got a nice  imagination oh did you like did you like that he was agreeing with you like two men of similar ilk 
[00:53:00]  like you'd go investigate you just go investigate like just repeat what you said yes indeed yeah  he uh i concur he uh he sort of fancies himself uh as someone who knows a little bit more about law  enforcement than he does but yeah he's young and impressionable and uh he'll learn when i was 18 i knew  it all also right so let me ask you with that test the whole part of the every moment of that is  got something to do with the test even if it's just you loosening the guy up does the test start 
[00:53:30]  before you actually said the test started um no the test starts once it starts and as a polygraph  examiner the only thing that i utilize in determining whether a person is being deceptive or truthful  are the charts but i do need to establish a rapport i establish a rapport i try to make friends with  the person i try to put the person at ease by explaining the process answering their questions and  taking the mystery out of the polygraph it also gains confidence where a lot of people that are 
[00:54:00]  guilty will confess prior to the polygraph for what's known as fear of detection uh-oh this guy's  telling me this thing works and he's explaining to me and he's showing me the reasons why you know  what maybe i better cut a deal here so a lot of times we'll get confessions before the polygraph even  starts interesting and you because you're basically telling them you can't lie to the machine  because it's an involuntary using a different part of your brain right there are ways to beat it but  i know it's extremely difficult to beat i'm sorry countermeasures are something that people will 
[00:54:30]  advertise on the internet or post the only problem with countermeasures is it's very obvious to a  trained examiner that you're employing countermeasures right so countermeasures by doing things with your  body are not easy to do unless you've been trained by the military so in case you're captured in iraq you're not  a spy but you're really a civilian contractor and that takes years of training so if i come in and  i say i read this on the internet and i'm going to do this or that or control my breathing or squeeze 
[00:55:00]  my butt cheeks that's an instant fail so you'll notice yeah we notice it right away wow yeah and  people will do drugs they'll take all sorts of uh medicines that they don't disclose as a countermeasure  but then once again tacking the shoe yeah well the tacking the shoe that was you to fail because  once you cause yourself pain you're going to cause a reaction ah but people smoke pot they'll take  sedatives but it's obvious when i'm looking at the charts that you are less reactive and i don't know  if you heard but i asked him what kind of medicines do you take what medical conditions do you have 
[00:55:30]  right so i know when i'm looking at a chart he has a little bit of anxiety but he's not taking meds  so i know how he should be reacting i'm sorry didn't the lutz is passing a polygraph from the  amityville horror or is that was that a myth um i don't know i'm not too familiar with the  polygraph on that and uh where's the courts with uh these tests okay so well polygraphs have been  around for almost a hundred years today polygraphs are admissible in in court itself in approximately 
[00:56:00]  20 states as well as the federal government and federal immigration court but polygraphs are used  here in new york state um i'm on the expert roster for the city of new york um as well as for criminal  and state supreme court and what we do is we utilize polygraphs to adjudicate cases before they go to  trial so for example um a kid was arrested for selling heroin to a narcotics cop and the kid's story  was i found 20 and this is a true case i found 20 on the floor and the next thing i know i pick it up 
[00:56:30]  and a cop jumps out of the bushes and locks me up says you sold me heroin well the district attorney  said i don't like this cop because every kid he arrests tells the same story how many kids are going  to make up the same story so she encouraged him to have his defense lawyer get a polygraph which he  did the kid passed it so now the cop is under investigation and the kid's free so we utilize it  outside of the courtroom but between defense attorney and district attorney to get to the  bottom of things because they kind of know how accurate it is despite the legality of well the 
[00:57:00]  district attorney has a polygraph unit the nypd is a polygraph unit the federal government has over  600 polygraph examiners on their payroll well polygraphs are probably one of the most utilized and  famous law enforcement tools yeah with that said we got anthony's brother on the line  well who wants to desperately i remember brother joe what's up you got daniel riba riba cough  daniel riba cough uh that's the only the only thing i can tell you is that i beat it i'm not 
[00:57:30]  a professional i i you know i i don't know any more than uh the average person but i told myself  before taking the test and i don't want to get into details of why i had to be tested  that you really did think she was over the age of eight where she she looked at least 12. what i  what i what i what i did was basically i um in in the examination room i stared straight ahead at  at a at a doorknob and um and answered all the questions uh completely uh completely falsely 
[00:58:00]  i mean you know i had a lie right out lie to beat it and nothing and uh and i and i was and i was  passed i mean i you know it could be it could have been the examiner that's um yeah some other  exams but it was a very popular polygraph uh company uh uh here on here on the island uh in  nassau county how long ago was that it was a company i mean you know how long was it uh joe  ago had to be about had to be god about 20 years ago okay i'm sure a lot a lot uh change sure yeah 
[00:58:30]  the technology has changed it was a matter of keeping it in your head that there's no way this  machine is going to be able to tell whether or not my mind is telling the truth well it's all  physiological changes i mean that's that's what that's what triggers these machines that what's  what makes the uh the results uh that that come up on the graph on the graphs on these machines  correct me if i'm wrong but that's what makes no it is uh you know true or false correct or uh 
[00:59:00]  you know guilty or not guilty and i just kept telling myself there's no way right well there's  there's a lot to it a lot has changed in the past 20 years if you think uh cell phones you know we had  cell phones that were glued to your car and now you have them uh that you can't even find them in your  pocket so technology has advanced computerized uh polygraphs are out uh techniques formulation of  questions have changed where um now the scientific accuracy in a study of field exams versus laboratory 
[00:59:30]  created situations um has shown it to be 98 accurate so wow it's a cold two percent joe i'm sorry for  interrupting but is the questioning still based on yes and no answers uh yeah they're always yes or no  they're reviewed with the examinee prior and um once again question formulation is certain other scoring  questions that we ask so uh it's come a long way and now we understand a little more about the brain 
[01:00:00]  with the advent of uh functioning mri scans that different parts of the brain are utilized let me  jump in so you believe that people could uh you know lie through this whole thing right some people  are more what would be the percentage though uh it's it's a small percent and once again by  a trained examiner utilizing proper procedures and modern equipment it's it's very difficult to to  defeat will they ever get it to where it's a hundred percent accurate you think or well you  know nothing in science is a hundred percent if you take a mammogram it's not a hundred percent if uh 
[01:00:30]  you know you go for a blood screen it's not a hundred percent yeah all right joe you liar  all right joey yeah joe come in for a test i'll take i'll take care of you no problem come on  it i still don't think i would i would definitely do it at a future date i i still don't feel like  yes or no answers are going to give you uh a uh you know uh guilty or not guilty  what was one of was one of the questions did you ever have sex with a goat and did you answer nah  look out look out why would joe say nah i get it i get it because that would make me oh i get it 
[01:01:00]  all right joe didn't get it later joe see you man okay so where are we at that was a big one  you want to bring derrick in or lufthansa heist he was talking about by the way yeah he wants  security go look at him look at him do you want to bring derrick in at this point or yes let's  i think we've derrick in bring in the examinee the examinee examinee okay yeah can we set uh  derrick up close to the table or yeah yeah might as well make it easy under it here we come 
[01:01:30]  derrick sit sit over near danny or take his mic whatever cool you don't have to leave then he  he could stand right there um well derrick uh how do you think yeah put your headphones on put  them on like jimmy if you want well uh ask him first how how'd you feel in there in general yeah  how'd you feel in there a little anxious anxious yeah yeah yeah and uh how did you think you how  do you think you did we none of us know by the way yet i believe some questions i may have showed 
[01:02:00]  i was telling the truth in some countries i was telling a lie why would you have showed you were  telling a lie if you're being truthful i was being truthful but you know what i mean my breathing i  noticed my breathing was changing a little differently but it's also brain function muscle  reflux like i said no the breathing might show that i was lying but the brain function will show  that i was one of the questions i already forgot you answered differently yeah you answered we asked  you so that one right there was a lie which one was this i think it was the body scar one oh right  the chest no yeah i mean it's like i said i said i had scars but they were like discoloration 
[01:02:30]  shit like that and they may have disappeared because they were there for a very long time  what and then what happened they just disappeared on the way in yesterday no i don't think i don't  think they just disappeared on the way in yesterday but yesterday when we asked you you're like oh yeah  scars on my chest like you were pretty damn confident you had a scar on your chest and i think you were  implying yesterday that they were there and you know they were from these robberies or or assaults no  listen they were there they were there i'm not saying that you know that i've never had them they  were there i know they were there and then you said uh maybe it wasn't 40 times that you were 
[01:03:00]  robbed no it's probably not 40 times like i said that was around that was a rounded number rounded  number i liked this too by the way he said that um he was robbed 40 times and 99 percent of the  people that robbed you were black no they were okay do you realize that you need 100 people to rob you  for one person to not be black so a half a person you can't get 99 percent of 40 people and have a full 
[01:03:30]  person you were robbed by a fraction of a person he was half black half white yes it was gary coleman  it just mathematically didn't work out i just found that funny i'm not deceiving just kind of funny  no i'm just i was never good at math it was nice hearing you and the investigator talk though  they're just yeah yeah like you're two gentlemen of a similar criminal justice and yeah yeah  shit like that it's kind of like everything in the um oh what do you think we're just going to  leave you alone in there and not put on the show we've heard everything you said you just had a great 
[01:04:00]  segment yeah yeah nice nice nice good to know yeah all right so what should we do this i think so  yeah let's uh now um see what the what the results were all right so uh basically i tested our uh  examinee derek here um on two charts i reviewed the questions with him beforehand we changed some  of the relevant questions um the one that had been proposed was have you been robbed 40 times and 
[01:04:30]  discussing with him um he said well it was definitely more than 20 times maybe not 30 to 40 you know sort  of the fish story it was a 300 pound fish when it was really an 80 pound fish so i asked him have you  been robbed more than 20 times and the results of that question are that there is deception indicated  in both charts meaning that the subject did not tell the truth oh oh boy oh we need some sound effects 
[01:05:00]  but he was truthful on other questions yes he is in fact not in san francisco right he's not in san  francisco he was sitting there you go so i asked him oh wait a minute hold on we need the  yeah we need some stuff here the game show oh boy yeah so i have this prepared i'm sorry okay yeah so  that's uh ready for the next question wait before we move on so so derek you you haven't been robbed uh 
[01:05:30]  over over over 20 times yeah it's okay listen i am being truthful i have been robbed over 20 times  and that's not a lie why would that come out as being a little deceitful there i don't know we were  at 40 by the way 40 times now we're now it's not even 20 times everything's negotiable right yeah yeah  seems so all right all right so next question ready yes during an attempted robbery was your ipod the 
[01:06:00]  target his answer was yes and the results of that question it is that he did tell the truth there is  no deception indicated oh okay so uh somebody did try to get your uh ipod okay next question did a  male cut you with a box cutter during an attempted robbery the examinee answered yes and the results of  that once again once again no deception indicated whoa tough guy next one were you how does that make 
[01:06:30]  me tough i was i wasn't the stabber i was just getting cut tough man that that's a surprise right  there because i didn't buy that either yesterday yeah i wasn't buying it i think he did it to himself  danny hurt himself wow okay i asked him were you hit with a pipe in an attempted robbery the examinee  once again answered yes and the results are no deception indicated the pipe the knife all right 
[01:07:00]  all right he's a good victim yeah yeah all right now were you twittering racial remarks before your  internship began once again he answered yes and the subject is telling the truth he's been a racist all  along ah there is no deception indicated on that do you pretend you're a racist for attention  the answer is no and the results no deception indicated the subject did tell the truth he is  really a racist yeah wow look at you genuine um and here's a good one that you guys are going to 
[01:07:30]  really appreciate have you ever lied to opie and anthony oh shit answer no results deception  indicate 
[01:08:00]  wow so uh you have lied to us probably about the 20 times so i think he's an exaggerator not a liar  and uh it's lying no but there's a difference between a guy who's been robbed a few times who  tries to make it seem like a little more than a guy who out now just says i've been robbed when  he never has this is to me there's a different motive there one tells tall tales okay one is a  producer definitely definitely some surprises there the thing is though we the twitter thing i have a 
[01:08:30]  question for because they say that his racist twitter started they can go back and see where they were  they say his racist tweets started the day after he got his internship email look who investigated  it was love buzz it was love buzz i mean think about it how far back did he really go  how far back did he go before his internship have you ever given a lie detector test to a turnip  yeah you want to try because here's the turnip bring him in i love buzz yeah um how far back did you go 
[01:09:00]  to look and see if he had any racist tweets before his internship i went back to may 26th so i went  exactly a month what well a month may 26 first of all it's not even you fucking boob it's june 15th  well you know exactly a month from june 26th when steve sent this email it's it's not june 26th yet  drug test drug test time what are you talking about i'm talking about may 26th i got the we know 
[01:09:30]  that yeah to what may 26th to april 26th oh you went back a month yeah i went back a month that's  what i meant okay all right god i can bring in the tweets if you want no that's okay that's all right  polygraph question are you under the influence of narcotics no  that really isn't yes can you tell people are lying by just looking at them  as an investigator i've been doing it for years so some people won't submit to a polygraph exam but 
[01:10:00]  during an interview you do get a pretty good idea you get a good idea sure what's a good what's a  good way of telling uh usually if they turn red and swallow hard usually usually you got kids yeah  i'd hate to be yeah your son holy i would just act weird when i was telling the truth  yeah did you do your homework yeah we have uh we have you have to ask our producer a does he think 
[01:10:30]  he's an effective producer and b is he gay yes and i would like you to ask him just in conversation  has he ever held the penis in his mouth i'm not saying he had to worship it but he has he  ever had one in the mouth by either on purpose or accident seems not happy would he be you have  to ask him some basic questions you could just tell by his again you could tell by his uh body  language and we'll make it very clear that you know yes not you just guess it's not accurate yeah 
[01:11:00]  he's not hooked up to a machine right nothing he should be you want to put steve in the comfortable  chair behind you jimmy uh yes steve this uh this fine gentleman has a couple questions for you yes  there's a couple of techniques how about how about love buzz get the fuck up yeah love buzz you just  kind of lounging like it's fucking fucking grandmother's patio get up there hi steve hi  this is daniel hi steve how are you i'm fine daniel how are you good can you raise your right hand 
[01:11:30]  please all right so we're gonna ask you a couple of questions today have you ever taken a hot soapy  shower with a man no what do you guys think um probably he might not have i doubt he's showered  they probably like the manly odor see if he's uh has uh does he think he's a good producer do you  think you're a good producer yes he is telling the truth there which means he's a sociopath he has  illusions of grandeur he doesn't he doesn't know any better has he ever have he has he ever held 
[01:12:00]  another man's penis have you ever in his mouth or in his hand uh in his hand let's start with the  hand in his hand have you ever held another man's penis while it was erect in your hand no oh he's  got an issue there usually what happens is when you laugh you sort of stall to be able to create the  lie so or if you repeat the question yeah like you know you ask a question the guy goes uh you know 
[01:12:30]  did you cross the street did i cross the street that's a delay exactly right there sure you enough  time i've seen that one before on uh first 48 you see that a lot yeah yeah it's great we use that  for hecklers yeah someone heckles you fucking repeat it gives you that half a second extra time  i kind of like this you you come up with the next question for him to ask um has he ever um  looked at another man and wanted to engage in oral sex with him but not said anything  have you ever had the desire to perform oral sex upon another man but never moved forward with it 
[01:13:00]  no he's telling the truth that's right he always sucks  no matter what i say i'm gay he's telling the truth would make him a bad guy would you rather be  the top or the bottom in a homosexual encounter well how do i answer that though i can't it's got to be  would you like to be the top in a homosexual encounter do you prefer to be the pitcher or 
[01:13:30]  the catcher yes we'd be the pitcher neither neither he's abstaining now yeah there's something going on  there have you ever held another man's penis in your mouth and made this sound oh and do it just  like that sir and do it just like that uh wait does he have to ask have you ever had the sexual  physical contact with your mouth and another man's penis no he's telling the truth i doubt he answered  that question right away he kind of knew the answer he had to give yeah like ask me a question 
[01:14:00]  ask me if i ever held a penis in my mouth he was prepared have you ever held another man's penis  in your mouth yes  have you ever held another man's penis in someone else's mouth  oh that he failed  he's like damn he found me out  all right so  well all right what derek is uh being truthful good derek far exaggerate but he's not a liar  exactly exaggerate it'll exaggerate 
[01:14:30]  we'll put him in that category he exaggerates a bit exactly he doesn't always lie only usually when  his lips move oh  ah shit so what are we playing a lot of lie detector jokes  i got i got plenty of them yeah polygraph  i'll play my polygraph joke knock knock who's there i'm asking questions here  oh chip like that yeah that's a good one yeah maybe steal that one yeah feel free  i should have a lie detector machine you know telling the truth

[01:26:00]  it is what it is you know yeah you gotta go uh if you just want attention you go across the street  not down the road you know what you're pretty much right i didn't know that at the time though i will  say that yeah you thought you were really making an effort i know i'll show everyone i'll show  everybody i was i'm gonna kill myself i i i i know from whence i speak if that's your expression  yeah i was an attention whore and a fucking was nerd i am now but at least i'd fucking tap dance for 
[01:26:30]  it yeah at least i'm willing to put on a white tux and cab callaway for you put on a little show  a little soft a little soft a little soft shoe yeah motherfucker do a little soft it's humiliating i  would like signed notes and blood oh god it was awful yeah they'll you know yeah my funeral and  they'll be sorry that you know yeah we won't have jimmy around anymore i'm gonna do it yeah i'll show 
[01:27:00]  him oh not showing anybody no one no no one like oh what's jimmy doing yeah this  asshole again ruining our good time this asshole again i love how sad people tell you everyone  who's left them and wounded them and then this one did that and shut your fucking mouth 
[01:27:30]  no concept that they're the cause of everybody leaving right that there's a reason everybody  fucking hates you it's because of who you are yeah no people don't hate you by accident stupid  fucking man it is exhausting it is exhausting so the only way to deal with them is to just ignore  them it really is ignore them oh they'll clamor for the attention like little dogs scratching at  the door not one ounce of self-worth notice me 
[01:28:00]  hey uh we got a we got dj on the line uh dj hey what's up what's up opie anthony yes  happy listeners i've been listening to you since day one i used to listen to howard stern back in the 80s  uh when i heard you guys i thought yous were the greatest so i started listening to you i said 
[01:28:30]  fuck howard but you know i'm mentally ill i got bipolar panic disorder and the way jimmy's been  talking about the mentally ill is really making me uh feel disgusted because as far as i'm concerned  he's mentally ill and he doesn't have no sympathy or empathy for the mentally ill that's not that's not  true that's not true no it is it is he's right no it's sort of what jimmy was saying 
[01:29:00]  i heard you i heard the first part of what you said he's right so i'm going to respond and then you  can finish i i said you can finish after i respond this is why i don't like the mentally ill because  you don't know how to have a conversation you just want to babble at somebody how about when you say  something which you did that i respond and then you can say something else point right now dj okay  the bottom line is dj what bothers me it is the lack of ability that mentally ill people have  to see how they negatively affect the lives of people around them it's your opinion and they do 
[01:29:30]  they do and that's a chemical imbalance exactly dj i agree with dj on this one i'm sure you do and  let me let me tell you something you've already told me something and it didn't change my opinion  i hadn't all you're doing is making me realize how correct i am for five and a half months they  wanted to give me electric shock treatment should have and with a high voltage fucking line why don't  you just stop misbehaving why don't you just stop it i know it's all about jokes and fun but there's 
[01:30:00]  no but after that there's no but it's all about jokes and fun there's no but do you understand i don't  care if you're affected with it you didn't call up and complain we were talking about  rape or sodomy but the one that affects you you have a problem with i know it hits close to home  but guess what it hits close home to you too because as far as i'm concerned you're mentally ill  no you didn't i won't even disagree with you i got sympathy and empathy for you i don't need your 
[01:30:30]  empathy or sympathy because i won't even disagree but i'm not so delusional that i i thrust myself  into people's lives when i'm not welcome i'm not delusional enough to think let me finish to think  that people around me should be affected by every do you see what i'm saying do you understand what  you're doing on them huh do you understand what you're doing you're just babbling over when i talk 
[01:31:00]  this is probably what you do in your daily life do you understand that dj listen i'm just trying to get  a point across you're babbling over everything i say i'm listening to you language anthony what i'm  saying is what bothers i i know i'm a little nuts and i acknowledge that but on a personal level i don't  thrust myself into other people's lives incessantly and sit there i certainly do and i'm not a wrecking 
[01:31:30]  ball in everybody's life wrecking occasions wrecking everything with just me me me that's what i'm  talking about i just want to make a point across that people with mental illness need support network  in their life i'm sure they do and i i have a mental illness as myself and i i understand what  they are and i understand that mentally ill people are a lot of times start doing well but if you need 
[01:32:00]  medication take your not you necessarily take medication can i ask dj uh a question are you fully  aware what your mental illness does to others around you yeah it brings them down and it makes  them miserable see you're in a different place i think jimmy is uh talking about the people that  aren't even aware how they affect everybody around them and even when they are aware they  continue doing it i actually have no problem with uh someone like dj i really don't i understand what  you're trying to say there i i'm frustrated by the people that uh cause just fucking havoc wherever 
[01:32:30]  they go and don't even have a fucking clue what they're doing now opie you talked about your mother  and i understand i know it's been a year but it's enraging it's fucking you know what you're  crying and it is sad it really is it's not like a fucking heart condition it's not like missing a  limb it's fucking it's a it's the brain that we don't really understand and it's a chemical imbalance 
[01:33:00]  we dj we understand that but you have to understand right you see what i'm saying you  fucking see what i'm saying it's not just about you and your fucking treatment do you understand  nobody talks about how enraging it is for the people around you it's always focused on the person  me my medicine i'm sad me me me how about the family members nobody talks about how angry it makes 
[01:33:30]  them for no reason when they should only take their own lives nobody talks about how angry  why do you think the response was what it was because it's always focused on the treatment and  the person and their sadness and their medicine and the white in the corner of their lips and it is  never focused on the people around them mentally ill for years i'm glad you have been i don't want to 
[01:34:00]  talk to you i want to talk to people who've been annoyed by you for fucking years no no from doctors  instead of oh fuck them too fuck them too all they do is pump you fucking zeros full of medication  and send you home to annoy everybody i'm fucking tired of it i'm not just behave  i went to work and i still fight the fight and you see you you fight you do blah blah blah 
[01:34:30]  you know what hardy i'm tired of your bullshit blah blah blah  dj i understand i understand you're fighting a good fight  ah shut up mark david chapman all these fucking nuts they fucking stalk celebrities and they shoot them  fuck these nuts tired of them and their fucking obsessions dj is just trying to survive i'm glad  you do he's just trying to survive jimmy he's fucking sick of this coddling in these 
[01:35:00]  fucking whack bags walking around yelling on subway trains smother them with fucking mattresses  hey i'm on a train shitting you should be killed you fucking lump on the fucking lung of society  shut up not you dj i'm speaking in general here but it's the obsession they have with themselves  that makes me i empathize with the guy who's sick and trying i really do i've been a fucking  sober person for a long time and i know a lot of crazy fucking people i am talking about how nobody 
[01:35:30]  fucking discusses the effect they have on everybody around them and it's not all the mental illness at  times there is a narcissism and a self-centeredness and a self-obsession which goes into it that's the  part that i'm really attacking right right well i've been contributing to society ever since i've  been sick i'm sure you have been what have you done dj how do you contribute to society i work i pay my 
[01:36:00]  taxes okay good i have a good relationship with my ex-wife who got rid of me because of my mental illness  that's not cool that's one that's one person that's the annoyed yeah she's had enough of it  that's it's like when i watch hoarders my throat hurts when i watch hoarders i just yell kill this  thing i really do i can't watch hoarders because my girlfriend's like will you shut up i can't watch  hoarders all i do is go why are you fixing this allow this fucking lump to be buried under their own 
[01:36:30]  excrement and newspaper collections no it sounds like tough love you got to give them tough love  tough love tough love is right hold on uh dj i'm gonna put you on with hillbilly bob from missouri who's  also mentally ill hillbilly bob what's up you're on with dj and uh and you got us of course well  first of all i love jibby i think he's great and i agree with almost everything he says  just about this one instance my mom had mental illness my whole life growing up she was hospitalized 
[01:37:00]  several times one time she called all of us kids together there was five of us she took a bunch of  pills and said goodbye i'm going to kill myself and when you grow up in an environment like that my aunt  killed herself my mom tried to kill herself you realize that this disease affects everybody in the  house yes and we loved our mom but i determined when i grew up i knew i had her genes in my body  i knew that i would be affected by this at some point and so i whenever i see these signs come out i 
[01:37:30]  suck it up i man up and i make sure that i check myself because i know i know that if i'm a dick  to my family if i'm a dick to my wife i've been married to the same woman for 28 years it's going to  wreck my kid's life it's going to wreck my wife's life and i don't want to continue this and a lot of  these illnesses if you track them back they're they're six and seven generations long you can  follow it back that can i ask you a question like even though like again with mental illness i i'm 
[01:38:00]  sure you love your mother and you have empathy but on some level somewhere back there even though you  know she was mentally ill or crazy or whatever it was don't you have an anger where you just want  to sit her down and go you fucking selfish motherfucker sitting all these kids down in a  room and behaving in such a i'm not gonna do it being selfish i'm not asking you excuse me selfish  it has a lot to do with being selfish do you do you see what i mean selfishness is an emotional state 
[01:38:30]  i'm not talking to you got that right i'm asked i'm asking the other guy not you selfish  i would get so angry with her thank you sir i could see what she would do to my brothers and  my sisters and they'd sit around and they'd cry and they'd figure out but she didn't intentionally  would do that to you because he said how the fuck do you know you aren't there  you know what you see and you know i live through it every day so did he dude dj why 
[01:39:00]  shut up man if you go to a psychiatrist you're not going to get your money's worth because he's going  to be listening to you instead of you listening to him right the psychiatrist got me in the hospital  more than a dozen times listening to that gag ball in your mouth dude shut up for five seconds yeah  take the cotton out of your ear and put it in your mouth dj good one jim take the cock out of your ass dj  even better hey jimmy i love you opie i love you anthony you guys are the best thank you man thank you 
[01:39:30]  sir i'm gonna love the dirt sucks cock wow jesus that's not lucky him who doesn't enjoy a good hog  why should howard be any different billy bob's out you should have said boy i thought you loved us  billy bob's out he's out uh dj yeah yeah man dj i feel for you today you i i dj speak in my language  i think dj won the debate to tell you the truth yeah dj yep because i i agree with everything dj said and 
[01:40:00]  probably agreed with maybe one thing that jimmy said that actually makes me feel like my point is  better than i originally anticipated it would be thank you jimmy's being a little harsh on the  mentally ill right pictures of mental health in this room don't agree with me jesus one picture  of scabby's hat since 1976 and one goes home and sips a bud light and wakes up at eight o'clock  the next morning and goes what happened and they say it's fucking march  oh god talk right over the punch lines timing of prozac in the ninth inning see how i changed that 
[01:40:30]  from diarrhea to suit you it's all about you my name is dj mckay and this is my best friend bear  oh jesus christ do you not hear do you not hear the fucking monotone way you're barreling through  everything dj for the love of pete dj tell them how it is man yeah come on ask me to sign a copy of  catcher in the rye and then shoot me in front of the dakota you fucking loon dj i don't read i  listen to you of course that's right you're just trying to prove you're a boob he's just trying to 
[01:41:00]  get through his day jimmy let him just try to get through just another guy trying to fight the good  fight and get through the day right understand why you don't see it dj's way in this earn a good wage  what do you do for work dj earned a pretty good wage point in you jimmy because i expected more from  you i worked down at bill cox's outfit fixing lawnmowers wait and whatnot but we gotta get  you're disappointed with jimmy huh why are you disappointed with me because i thought he would  be more understanding and sympathetic and empathetic to people with mental illness i have been for a long 
[01:41:30]  time i have been but it gets to be too much jimmy you're right yeah uh dj i think you might have  got to jimmy a little bit nah he's being he's being phony he's just being uh no i'm not no if you  remember towards me because i'm upset no dj i'm telling you remember about a month or so ago jimmy  cried over roger ebert and we're having that same same thing is happening right now jesus i'm not a good 
[01:42:00]  actor i can't even pretend i'm sad i got a hard on right now i'm sorry i answered wrong  you know how heartbreaking it is that the mentally ill guys saw through my bad acting it was the  easiest thing to do though i know oh dj you're gonna be all right dj yeah when i wake up tonight  why you why you disappointed me because i differ with like of all the horrible things i say 
[01:42:30]  on the show expressing my opinion no you don't say horrible things you're a very intelligent person  thank you but i attack children i attack race i attack a lot of things horribly you wake up for  a lot that's off the show yes yeah you're just disappointed that he didn't see your way huh dj  and that makes you really upset doesn't it do you see what i know and i'm going to talk to dj  well let me ask are you you're really upset because jimmy let you down today huh yeah yeah 
[01:43:00]  then how come you're not giving me yesterday i listened to yesterday and he was ranting and raving  about it yesterday why are you not dj let me ask you a question i i tried to commit suicide and you  guys talk about taking the easy way out yeah and i found out a bridge i could jump off of and that's  good you're gonna have that on your fucking conscious uh jimmy no i won't um no because  he don't know me from shit so it don't shut your goddamn pie hole anybody you're right i've i've i've 
[01:43:30]  got my own fucking problems that i try to fix and not burden everybody else with my question is this  can we give him fezzy's number why won't you give me the same fucking the same leeway you want like you  want all this leeway as someone who's mentally ill and i snap because occasionally i am affected by  mentally ill people and i'm fucking tired of it and instead of understanding that and going you know  what these crazy motherfuckers really are at times enraging uh figures in people's lives you immediately 
[01:44:00]  take up for the mentally ill instead of instead of stepping out of yourself and realizing wow people  who deal with mentally ill people really do have cause to be angry sometimes well but i just want to  tell you jimmy that we try to do the best we can for ourselves and the people around  yes dj some of you do some of you do a lot of you don't i was disabled in 96 i went back to work in 
[01:44:30]  99 wait wait wait what do you mean you were hold on what do you mean you what happened disabled what  happened i was put on social security disability i found the job in 99 wait why were you put on yeah  what happened why were you put on was it physical or mental by bipolar panic disorder

[01:45:30]  dj but why is it everybody wants to be christ again how come no one ever says i'm the second  coming of some guy named frank who was killed in 1870 while he was staring at the ass of a young  boy in a car hit him why is nobody the second coming of that guy 1870 yes it was a guy pushing  a card of molasses sorry and it's honey what where have you lost your sense of humor what happened i'm 
[01:46:00]  joking about something and you just come on what are you doing dj i'm upset i'm sorry yeah he's very  upset panicking i made fun of connor peterson we make fun of everything horrible and i lash out at  something that affects you and you get mad you're further proving the self-centered point i was making dj you  you live close you want to come in i live in kingston new york socrates i'm gonna try to get  a job in manhattan oh no yeah you want to come in and hang with the boys i would love to all right 
[01:46:30]  well i'd meet him i'm sure he's a sweet guy yeah we'll we'll have dj you're not gonna shoot me are you  hell no okay jimmy i think you're hilarious thank you you just but he let you down  well because i didn't expect it from him yeah dj felt like i was attacking him personally to  expect from jimmy exactly i didn't expect to did you expect i listen to i listen to you guys every  day i listen to the replay when i get up at night i worked the 10 to 6 shift and uh yeah it did hit

[01:49:00]  the center hi um i used to work with the mentally ill uh when i was in college and um i think that  dj like really even though he doesn't stop talking he doesn't really understand that jimmy is saying  something completely different like he's not attacking him he's you know attacking the people  who are affecting his life and and dj's just taking it personally and he sounds like he probably does  have taken you very personally that's right no because you know what bothers me is um i know that 
[01:49:30]  i'm affecting the people around me in a negative way then cut the bunk how about you just this  how about you fucking how about you just cut the malarkey man up yeah why don't you get a little  fucking moral strength and just cut it out just cut this shit morality and therapy is  bullshit no it's not it's not bullshit and there is something as much as morale there is such a  thing as morality yes there is oh shit there is no morality really so it's okay that what what why

[01:53:00]  book all i gotta do is fucking look at these kooks and these whack jobs right in front of you  not you guys no i don't but i don't need to read a psychologist why do they do it i don't give a  fuck just stop doing it to me you don't have to sympathize but you know what as far as i'm  concerned you're so mentally ill you should empathize oh that's some knowledge right there dj 
[01:53:30]  oh dj hung up on that oh did he that was his  fucking part of his self-obsession dj wanted to get the last word and he's probably rehearsed  that conversation a few times let's go to brad in uh dt brad brad he's suffering from the dt this  this would be interesting well i don't have the dt's but i'd like to take a crowbar to that guy's  watery head whoa these people what he doesn't say or what he doesn't acknowledge is that people like  that suck the life out of everyone around them i went through it for 20 years with my ex-wife it 
[01:54:00]  wasn't until i took the car took the kids ended up broke both of us before she even admitted that  she had a problem she still fucking denies that there was ever any issue and and those type of  people it's all about them and every single person around them ends up drained exhausted and they  hate her a year and a half of therapy to get my kids to the point where they can just start to to be  normal they suck the life out of everyone around them they don't give a shit and they think it's 
[01:54:30]  everybody else's problem but theirs and i'm not talking by the way about thank you for saying that  i'm not talking about like people who are profoundly retarded retarded people  to me but i don't mean i don't mean retarded people like this so i don't want anybody to call  up my son's got down syndrome i'm not talking about that you know i think people know the the  people i'm talking about it it's not that it's people yeah it's that uber narcissism man yes  around them and and at what cost i mean everyone else is affected so what are we supposed to do 
[01:55:00]  it screws up what the fuck are we supposed to do because we're supposed we're supposed to have  sympathy for for people like that when they're affecting everybody around them affecting so many  fucking people yep at what cost do we say go fuck yourself and the uber narcissism yourself is right  that was the the uber narcissism that's not addressed enough it's like too much about their sadness and  their woes and their helplessness but not ever talking about the narcissism that does play a part 
[01:55:30]  which makes everyone else sad around that absolutely why is that why do we have to deal  with that because one person in our family is uh mentally ill that's a that's a very good question  today well and you know what you don't what it cost well in my case my marriage my freaking  finances to fight for cussing my kids because those people can turn on the charm they're all wonderful  and then the next minute it's oh my god nobody wants me it's all about poor me nobody understands  what i go through what do you mean what do you go through you fucking take everybody's emotions 
[01:56:00]  and you throw them up in the air and then you kick them to the curb and then when everybody says  finally fuck you then it's oh nobody understands me well i understand you get the fucking road  that's what they need to do all right brad i gotta get thanks brad there's way too many people want  in now jesus hammerhead in alabama hammerhead hi buddy hey listen man you're right to go off  on this pj cat i've been dealing with these cocksuckers my whole fucking life man my mom was nuts

[01:57:00]  i'm supposed to empathize and at times you want to grab them and throw them against the wall and go you  self-centered fuck shut your fucking mouth and look what you're doing to everybody and you try to  approach them with a legitimate complaint and they turn around on you like well what about the time  when you did this this this and this and they have a whole fucking list waiting for you they're not  that crazy because they can deflect right every bit of blame from themselves right every bit of guilt  from themselves we have a deflect we haven't talked about the deflecting game they play yeah holy

[01:59:00]  is lit i'm sure some people think i'm an asshole and that's fine you're tied with the field my own  life i thought i was a minority i was like no one fucking understands this shit but everybody goes  through this everybody you got one in your fucking uh circle there maybe not family but you know you  go through shit yeah even if it's not immediate family right it doesn't have to be immediate family  that's true that's true all right uh greg thank you thank you guys my mom let's just say this my  mom had certain issues that she's talked to me about that uh you know needed some work so what 
[01:59:30]  she did was she went to therapy and she worked through it and she told us look this is what's  happening blah blah blah you know she kind of walked us through it and uh you know at times it was a  little trying but it was nothing too it helped a lot because she was rational about it i know people go  well she could be and some people can't be but she wasn't so narcissistic that she didn't understand  that she was affecting people and then it kind of fixed itself was your mama dude no well why i 
[02:00:00]  thought it was a sex change operation jesus no no no no no she became a mom no no no that was  cuckolding that her my dad got issues they would always be a black gentleman according to dad  according to dad jesus all right let's go to uh nick in new york nick  oh what's going on we were supposed to break an hour ago hey man fuck that's which is funny i'm  just saying nick uh yeah what's going on hey we're talking to you nick you work in a pharmacy you need  help here you work in a pharmacy what do you got i work in a pharmacy i deal with depressed and

[02:01:00]  fucking pathetic and then there's also the actual sick people that actually need men and they can't get  it because of other people that really don't fucking need it and they pretend to have this  shit just for the attention yeah the uber no that guy that said uber narcissism yeah it's just a  part of it for some people look they can't help themselves i'm talking about the ones who are so  fucking self-absorbed and narcissistic along with being a little nuts and they don't ever talk about  their narcissism it's never narcissism never let's go to dak in kentucky dak yeah hey boys what's

[02:02:00]  here to talk about everyone else's problems that's it's so enraging just walk away from them ignore  them walk away sit in a room and fucking eat crushed glass you fucking nut that's all you can do ignore  them sounds harsh but i don't disagree with that what do you do when a toxic hornet lands on your soda  can do you poke it ignore it and it will go away the b is just doing what it does but it doesn't realize 
[02:02:30]  what an annoying fucking barbed asshole stinger it has and how everyone hates its guts it's a dumb  hornet and you want to just swat it and kill it but you can't because there are repercussions let's  go to jd in atlanta jimmy would you deal with this situation go ahead jd yeah i had mom that when i  was in how big your clit i'm sorry i thought my dad was going to wait wait you guys you guys  sorry i said a dirty joke sorry yeah go ahead jd okay yeah when i was in fourth grade my mother faked 
[02:03:00]  her own kidnapping because she was raped and oh it was a huge drawn-out ordeal because she wanted to  keep my stepfather around was she crazy or just manipulative she's just completely manipulative but  she um i mean the police got involved in the whole nine yards and the police were the ones that finally  came and said yeah this didn't happen and i had to learn out the whole truth from my uh real father  but um yeah it was horrible so i sympathize with you that's crazy damn what's me some crazy 
[02:03:30]  shit with me all right let's go to john in dallas john hey hey guys going on what's up john 12 12 years  of marriage to a crazy crazy bipolar woman i knew something was wrong when she started putting lipstick  on her eyebrows holy shit yeah exactly 12 12 years of sleeping with one eye open so i finally filed  for divorce a month later she killed herself and i'll tell you what it was the happiest day of my 
[02:04:00]  life wow was it was it on some level of relief no huge relief you have no idea she left me with three  kids you know what they uh they were quite young when she died which is good because they don't have to  grow up around that just just crazy but also how selfish how selfish to leave three kids no one  talks about the fact that sometimes people die and it's the happiest day of someone's life that was  very close to them yeah it's not always well you know my kids i mean but you say that people like how  could you ever say that that's crazy well you know what that's how i feel and that's what i tell 
[02:04:30]  everybody but bipolar disorder man i'm telling you right it's terrible and it's also pretty wicked funny  sometimes too i mean you know you just have to laugh at shit but anyway thanks guys thanks you know  before we move on and uh take a break we certainly have to take a phone call from cunt cunt cancer he  has something to say about this oh hi cunt cancer i see some of k's that's right oh i said cc i guess  it's kk uh yes uh mr cancer yes i don't know hey jimmy i think i know what you're saying man like my 
[02:05:00]  mom uh i found out recently like i always knew she was fucking nuttier in a fruitcake when that  she has uh something called borderline which is like a mix of bipolar and like she gets a friend  and a bunch of other bullshit because it was kind of like i hope he said you never knew who you're  coming home to yeah like you knew uh oh it could be fun mom or hit me in the face mom and uh i think  there's a responsibility like some of that shit goes through genetics and i deal with it my  fucking girlfriend i feel terrible for it because she deals with my little fucking 
[02:05:30]  in families here and there um i think it's a responsibility that mentally ill to like kind  of take care of themselves and govern themselves a little bit yeah you can know you're affecting  somebody but you have to kind of sit back and go i'm being a fuck stop it and uh like my girlfriend  i mean every once in a while she'll have to fucking smack me around and tell me to shut the  fuck up and i think you need to realize that yeah and the fucking mentally ill piss me the  fuck off i'm a paramedic and i have to deal with their little bullshit every day incidentally  my not that anyone thinks this but this my mom is actually not the person uh not that it matters 
[02:06:00]  and i'm not my mom wouldn't call me and go it was not her well i could say my mom is so yeah some  people it is the mom that's even harder i deal with a lot of the stuff that's being discussed  for some people it is and uh it's fun when it's your mom and your dad's an alcoholic well you know  what the problem is they always have something else to say they always have they need to be heard  they don't know how to just go away and shut the fuck up and leave people alone they don't know how 
[02:06:30]  to do it all right sir you're too intelligent by the way to have the name cunt cancer exactly at  least cunt polyp or how about cunt melanoma because i'm sure you would have caught it earlier  i guess we could uh take a break yeah i gotta pee the phones are fucking every line now it's crazy  my grandmother tried killing my uncle and grandfather because she suffered from depression  that's good when they take out everybody else with them of course that's just wonderful more  narcissism more fucking mirrors that they yell into and talk to themselves and fucking wackos mikey 
[02:07:00]  that sounds like a fucking horror show man what do you got hello yes sir hello gave you the great  setup too mike what do you got buddy actually um yeah my grandmother was she suffered from um uh both by  she was bipolar and and depressed and she was the one that um my grandfather and my uncle were taking  her to south oaks hospital and she grabbed the steering wheel and tried killing all of them so 
[02:07:30]  jimmy actually i wanted to thank you because um i think it's a hereditary thing because my family  suffers from depression i think i have it too it's not what you say it i guess it's how you said it  uh i felt that way where i wanted to you know walk up to my grandmother and kind of shake her and say  snap the fuck out of it you know what i mean yeah um i understand what you're saying i guess um  i kind of make me kind of make me realize that yeah it is it is a selfish thing and  you know i think you helped me a little bit to be honest with you seriously because it's the way 
[02:08:00]  you said it you know well thank you i appreciate that and it's again that's what i'm talking about  it's the idea there's to me anybody who's rational enough to go through daily life  and to know better than to just shit in the middle of the street if someone shits in the middle of  the street that person is certifiable and there's a difference but people that understand they have  to pay the phone bill they understand a lot anyone that would would grab the wheel of a car and try to  kill everybody in the car is a selfish narcissistic give a fuck about no one but themselves person 
[02:08:30]  yeah i didn't think about it until you know what you said earlier it makes a lot of sense so  seriously it helped me out i appreciate it take care man thank you all right brother thank you  we're helping we're helping we'll be right back with more of the best of opium 2010  hi i'm jessica shaw host of ew morning live on sirius xm's entertainment weekly radio hey i'm  dalton ross get ready people ew morning live on location from survivor we are going to get the

[02:13:30]  scenes anthony yeah the full song will be uh on the show tomorrow right fingers crossed so but you  guys cross i i was hearing uh it's gonna be done i'm quite confident we it was we've been doing a  lot of work on it it's all recorded it was all laid out yesterday it's in the final mixing stages  ah mixing tuning yeah just kind of fine tuning getting it all tweaking perfect tweaking right  and it features all the all the people you know love and hate from this radio show now these are 
[02:14:00]  the raw tracks yeah oh yeah that's what we're talking this is with the music eliminated and all  the effects and all that now normally the person hears the music in their headphones when you're  laying down your track and you sing along in the mic and to you it sounds like you know i'm hearing  the music and i'm singing uh but now the recording is is got all this separate so you can mix it you  know separate from the music so you take these tracks and isolate them without the music and you 
[02:14:30]  got yourself a genuine clusterfuck it's been driving troy out of his mind because like he produces real  music and it's like an audio guy yeah and so he's like you know trying to make everything perfect and  i keep telling him no just leave it alone and it's driving him insane because it's he's trying to make it  tell him don't don't don't even lose sleep over it yeah don't worry trying to make this sound good  it's not going to it's the thought that counts well we remember haiti no idea what this has to do 
[02:15:00]  with haiti we got uh we got a taste here we got uh kenny attempting the course and he might have  screwed up here all right we are the world we are the children we are the ones who make a brighter day  okay so let's start giving there's a choice we're making it's true i fucked it up 
[02:15:30]  what a dope that's one take kenny is that a good old one take kenny oh i thought he was talking about  everything in life yeah i fucked it up uh and then uh mustard is part of the song so we got a little  taste of how mustard is sounding yes mustard is the one guy who was like trying to sound really good  yeah he's trying yeah but the effect effectation on his voice and the whole deal 
[02:16:00]  there's a choice we're making saving our own lives it's true and like a brighter day  just you and me we are the world we are the world we are the children we are the ones who make a brighter  day so let's start giving let's start giving there's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives 
[02:16:30]  it's true we make a better day just you and me  it's not bad no it's actually not because i don't like the i don't like the  grab your lunch out of the dumpster the affectation yeah yeah but but he actually  did sound good there steven basho sounds like he's singing with an anvil on his chest  there is kind of a but you got a good version of mustard he wasn't all fucked up right no mustard 
[02:17:00]  was sober and he's actually very concerned because uh oh after troy explained what happened with his  album on the air yeah a lot of fans started contacting him and telling him how bad he  fucked everything up yeah and so oh shit yo good he should he's really trying to make an effort he  says he's not going to bring that guy that he brought with him back and he's going to come in  clean and he was sober when he did i'm still in man i want to like help him out and try to get this 
[02:17:30]  album out there but the first the first session with troy was a disaster it really was and then he  comes in for the we are the world recordings and he he was sober and sounded really good he was way  easier to work for i was worried that he wouldn't want to work with all the uh all the non-professionals  i have an idea yeah is it possible no you're right  uh first of all most artists don't get a chance to be told they're up like they usually  just up and that's it at least he's got a chance is there any way we look we very much wanted to see 
[02:18:00]  gray wolf yes that you could take mustard and get an extra verse out of him and somehow combine  him and gray wolf and perhaps get a fucking song that could be something maybe we have guys but  see the problem is we can't get gray wolf to redo what he did so we would have to use what gray wolf  did already absolutely yeah absolutely we've already tried to get gray wolf to reenact uh  what he did and it's just not happening you get get him to get because that goddamn gray wolf song 
[02:18:30]  i'll say it every time that thing is that's a masterpiece it's a minute short of a classic  oh we were so close to a big yeah that's all right you try to maybe get or have him and  fucking mustard do something together and then see if you can blend it in or just get mustard there's  a way to do that where you could probably get something out of it drew boogie is screaming at  his radio right now why because he tried to get some more out of gray wolf he couldn't get anything  out of him we'll try again maybe he spent a whole day in a studio with the guy and what what was 
[02:19:00]  gray wolf not doing just not sounding good or his mouth teeth in the way what happened i think he  wasn't he like wasn't sounding right and he kept insisting on playing the flute yeah it's just yeah  it's just nonsense for madonna it's just nonsense with madonna it's a flute slash weapon that's why  they're homeless by the way yeah they're not good at taking direction and like that when we should  rip the flute out of his hand and beat him to death sounds right treat yourself 
[02:19:30]  while you step on cakes yeah let's say how to bud the trucker exactly bud uh congratulations jimmy  you're gonna make a great father uh this is for mustard he's trying to make this piece of  shit sound good but he won't get off the toilet for his own career  true trying to make this piece of shit sound good that's true but it's his own stuff he falls  asleep here with a log hanging out like a fucking oxtail yeah yeah this piece of 
[02:20:00]  shit we are the world thing that we'll play like three times and then throw away  you're right and this fucking cd could be out there for a real long time to come  uh dash in syracuse dash oh yeah oh boy hey dash hello uh i got a birthday announcement for you  yeah uh daniel benoit was uh featured today here on channel nine in syracuse no way oh my see that  would be chris benoit's son that is no longer no longer with us and he was wished a happy birthday

[02:30:30]  we gotta go back and de-ice again  yeah  it's going to freeze up on us  and i'm getting a report from cleveland  joe in cleveland joe  hey man what's going on  hey  hey i'm sitting about two miles from the airport  to let jimmy norton know that we're supposed to get six to ten inches today  no  oh boy when is that  when is uh the snow hitting up there  it's right now  it's like two inches on the ground  he's so not leaving  yeah so they gotta take into consideration landing  yeah  oh my god 
[02:31:00]  poor kenny  poor kenny's gonna have to hear it  because kenny doesn't even know  kenny's sitting there like he's at a movie right now  he doesn't know  kenny is  he don't know the difference  kenny's like a dog when you leave him home  alone  and everybody's asked the question like  do they have any concept of time  yeah  like when you come home and they're like oh my owner's home  it's like does he know how many hours went by or does he just think five minutes  that's kenny  yeah  i'm on a plane  i'm sitting here  and it's like five hours on the runway  he'll have the same face as if it it just took off 
[02:31:30]  doesn't even need food or water  no i'm fine  i'm good  how are you jimmy  but jimmy's biting the seat in front of him  yeah to jimmy one minute it's like i don't know four hours  all right here's the uh new update  status delayed  departure is now 45 minutes late  well but they're already uh 37 minutes late  well now they're saying it's 45 but they keep doing this  i've been through this so many times where it's like 45 
[02:32:00]  and then it'll go to an hour  and then an hour 15  they just do in 15 minute increments to make you feel better  that's why this flight tracker is great because  you can just stay in the president's club and drink  and uh you don't have to keep going to the gate  and then when they say it's like oh uh we're 40 minutes late  and then you're sitting in the president's club you get up you go down to the gate and realize now it's even later  uh so you just take the flight tracker and go oh that is i'm good  oh it's so handy  that's a useful app  handy dandy  okay why don't we do oh another track from bobo 
[02:32:30]  we are the world  we are the children  we are the ones to make a brighter day  so let's all give in  there's a choice we're making  we're saving our own lives  it's true to make a better day  for you and me  you and me 
[02:33:00]  we are the world  we are the children  we are the one  who make a brighter day  so let's start giving  at least he got the words right though  bobo didn't even quite get all the words  the giving  the years of choice we're making  gig  it's really hard to continue radio after that fucking Ian Alper 
[02:33:30]  I know  it's hard to get to you  we should get the uh  fucking tornado came through  we really  no  a snow  a snow  a snow  a snow  a snow  a snow  a snow  a snow  a snow  a snow  yeah but i want to  what if it's a tornado and a snow storm  then it's a snornado  snornado  uh what if it's a  uh typhoon  and a snow  storm  a snow  a snow  a snow  snifoon  snife  why sni  i would have went snifoon  no because  there's too much typhoon in it  but then snow  has the entire word snow in it 
[02:34:00]  and typhoon is going to be like  what happened to me  snifoon  you gotta go snifoon  you know something  you're right  because i don't like when they have the whole word  yes  and then part of the other word  it's not right  it's got to be a combo  and and i hate anything  um  like workaholic  because it's got a hall  which is part of the alcohol  it should just be  you're a workick  yes that's true  because alcoholic is alcoholic  and then workaholic  why 
[02:34:30]  what is that  it's not like you're addicted to alk  that was that was actually me at any w  i was a workaholic  uh-huh  because i would drink alcohol as i work  that makes sense  but  if people are workaholic  it's like oh i'm a chocoholic  because you like chocolate  and alcohol  no you'd just be a chocolate  you'd be a chalkick  yeah  alcohol  well no actually  chocolate  chocolate  because it's the whole word alcohol  yeah  yeah so you're a workick  chocolate  but then you don't know what they're getting at 
[02:35:00]  cockick  if you're ian halperin  but then you don't know what  you're getting at though  workaholic explains what it is  but it's the alcohol part  that always bothered me  now it bothers me  yes  now it will  forever  forever  yes it will  and ever and ever  and ever and ever  yeah  frank mear  jesus  frank mear  the super across the way  are we still friends with dana white  because this would have been a great day to get dana white on  did we try  that's a steve carlessi question 
[02:35:30]  who the fuck knows who likes this day to day  you're right  that's what bo will call  we officially have to give up on tracy morgan  he's an eat ick  that sucks  kevin smith hopefully will be here  he's not going to be here  i think we've lost everybody  yeah why though  i don't know  we still got bobo  we're the titanic of radio  it's just people  people constantly are just going  getting into lifeboats and leaving  we're the  we're the guys going down to ship though  yeah yeah  exactly  yeah  classy guys  it's a very small hole  yeah  it's taking quite a while to sink

[02:40:30]  we are the world  of course you know  that was back in what  85  25 years ago  25 years ago  so for the 25th anniversary  they got together  a whole new group  of the stars  du jour  and some classic stars  got them in the studio  and did a new version  and we listened  and went  ha ha  are you kidding me  we could do better  than that  so we gathered up  the various 
[02:41:00]  lunatics  psychopaths  losers  loners  homeless  and of course  just some of the  characters from the show  and  did our own version  for the 25th anniversary  and this song  is historic  for two reasons  oh okay  number one  it may  we still have to  confirm this  it may be the  longest produced  bit  in ONA history  which means  we like it  yeah  so you can play it 
[02:41:30]  three or four times  nice  how about  it's the first  produced bit  in over five  five  of seven years  yeah that's another one  we have another record  we haven't produced  a bit in over seven years  number two  we believe it to be  the first  produced bit  that all three  members  Opie Anthony  and Jim Norton  of the show  are on  actually on  wow  which means  we were able to get  all three members  after the show  to record something  holy shit  so give yourselves  a round of applause 
[02:42:00]  what a huge undertaking  that is  did any of us  have their coats  off  okay  no  that's true  we all did our parts  with our coats on  I was actually  holding my bag  in my hand  well my scrotum  not my  of course  yeah  because I sing better  that way  there will be a video  really all parts  were filmed  so  fantastic  this is going to be  an official video  an official video  there will be a video  will it be edited  nicely  with some nice  fade 
[02:42:30]  trans  you know  because I want  this thing to look  really professional  yeah  I just have to get  some like  mountainous B-roll  and some E-roll  oh that would be good  and how about  starving children  and some starving children  okay  E-Rock  and well  that's what I mean  starving children  yeah  I just get him  in the office  grabbing his belly  just get people  with hunger pain  wow  so  now this was  weeks in the making 
[02:43:00]  yeah  I mean we had  the idea  when  as soon as  we are the world  25 was announced  we started  brainstorming  yeah  we decided to  wait until  the release  of the song  so we could  get a feel  for it  once we  played it  on the air  here  we knew  it was time  to start working  do we have  a list  of the participants  or  can you  off the top  you had  name some  of the  giant  celebrities  and stars  from this  very program  that participated  in this  historic event 
[02:43:30]  I would call it  well I mean  you'll hear  Anthony and  Opie of course  wow  yes  Uncle Paul  Ted Sheckler  Ted Sheckler  must have been  hard getting him  in  yeah  Lyle Chip  Chipperson  is on it  Lyle Chip  Chipperson  homeless mustard  stalker  patty  yes we heard  that  Big A  Bobo  Roland  Roland  the virus 
[02:44:00]  wait a minute  the virus  the virus  is on it  tank  hankerous  is on it  isn't that  redundant  well tank  hankerous  and the virus  appear back  to back  on the song  that's awesome  alright I'm  gonna really  have to keep  an ear open  to see when  the change  happens  because  I've noticed  can you say  one trick pony  as far as  voice impressions  it's just  a different voice  with the same  material  and if you  keep your ears  open  there's some 
[02:44:30]  voices from  the past  shit  towards the  end of the  song  I think  people are  gonna have to  listen to this  a couple times  to pick up  on everybody  that's in this  oh absolutely  wasn't that  the fun  of the original  we are the  world  is like  I think  that's  Steve Perry  there was  nothing fun  about it  no no  nothing at all  what am I  saying  hopefully ours  brings a little  fun  and I've  listened to it  several times  already  and if  what's fun  is the way  it's produced  in the chorus  yeah  everybody's  separated  and some  people panted  to the left  some  to the right 
[02:45:00]  so you can  hear the  separate voices  so every time  you listen  you can listen  for someone  else's voice  are you trying  to tell me  that this is  a stereo  oh yeah  sorry pal  talk baby  you're only  getting right  so you  miss  you're missing  half the song  you'll miss  some voices  yes  well let's  do it  on satellite  go fuck  yourselves  yeah exactly  help us out  get a little  satellite  are we ready  for this  I am  do we have  the big  production piece  to tell everyone 
[02:45:30]  once again  how great  we are  oh good  because we tell  everyone how great  we are every  morning right  that's what we  do  go listen  to Opie and  Anthony  they say how  great they are  I like that  that ought to  be a promo  yeah I think  it should be a  promo  we're not allowed  to play other  people's audio  unfortunately  well we'll just  make it a promo  for ourselves  let's play the  production piece  and let's do this  the premiere of  the Opie and  Anthony version  of We Are The  World  and now  the Opie and 
[02:46:00]  Anthony show  proudly presents  We Are The World  the world premiere  of Opie and  Anthony's  We Are The World  that's it  that's a bit  and then you  guys go  wow  yeah  it should kick in  right there  there's explosions  there's some  explosions  I like explosions  but no lasers  there's some  reverb  on the voice  it should have been  a little more  over the top  I'm thinking  a little more  lasers  sounds like  someone threw  that piece  together last 
[02:46:30]  minute  because they  didn't really  want to do  it for us  yes  somebody didn't  want to do  just was annoyed  that we were  bothering him  here's the song 
[02:47:00]  there comes a time  when we hear  a sudden call  when the world  must stand  together as one  there are people  dying  it's time  we lend a hand 
[02:47:30]  to land  the greatest gift  of all  we can't go on  pretending day by day  that someone  somehow  will soon  make a change  we are all  a part of  God's great big family  and the truth  you know  love is all 
[02:48:00]  we need  we are the world  we are the children  we are the ones  who make a brighter day  so let's start giving  there's a choice  we're making  we're so  you know  I think I'm  embarrassed  to this already  send your heart 
[02:48:30]  so they know  that someone  cares  so they cries  for help  we're not being  in vain  we can't let them  suffer  no we can't  tell them  to wait  or something  right now  they need a helping  hand  or foot  or maybe shoulders  let's save my life 
[02:49:00]  we are the children  we are the ones  to make a brighter day  so let's start giving  there's the choice  we're making  yes  we're saving  our own lives  it's true  we'll make a  gayer day  just you and me  see I'm gay  well you've done it  and there seems  no hope at all 
[02:49:30]  but if you just  believe  there's no way  we can fall  well well well  let us realize  that a change  can only come  when we stand  together as one  give yourself a feel  we are the world  we are the children  we are the ones  we make better things

[02:52:00]  I'm giving  I'm giving  I'm giving  wow  I um  I'm stupefied  I  what do you think  what do you think  I'm too tearing  I'm tearing up here  at the  beauty  well 
[02:52:30]  bravo to  Sam and Troy  and everyone else  what a production piece  that is  and the funny thing is  Club Soda Kenny  was really really mad  that you were auto-tuning  auto-tuning  but that could be the best part  of the whole fucking song  I love the auto-tune part  it's fantastic  yeah  oh wow  well we're going to have to  put that a few more times  epic  we have to make it available  for a download somewhere  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  but only  the difference is  we will pay you  to download it  instead of the way 
[02:53:00]  it usually works  well  fucking greatest  fucking song  fucking ever  that's one  awful me  from Wackbag  of course  Blue Healer  it's not the clusterfuck  I thought it would be  I don't know if that's  good or bad  I think that's a good  review  I want an  iTunes link  now  yeah  yeah  we got to get that out  that's Coco in the D  please don't play that again  I'm ashamed for you  it sounds like a zoo crew  when you  when you fabulous  I don't know 
[02:53:30]  all right  Punch It Out  sounds like the Muppet Show  kind of dead  a little bit  a little Muppety  what's wrong with that  that's what they sound like  yeah  it's just what they sound like  sound like Muppets  let's see  thank god you guys  don't do bits anymore  how many  how many guest Muppets  did you get from Sesame Street  wow  Redding says  that's a piece of shit  and the funniest piece of shit ever  oh good  Kenny with the auto-tune  was funny  mm-hmm  so  you're gonna have to hear it again 
[02:54:00]  there's a lot of people in there  like I heard Tim at the end  that has to be a little bit of a surprise  from our K-Rock days  you know  the  oh no  guy  a simple two word review coming in  shit sandwich  shit sandwich  again I don't know if that's good or bad  yes K-Rock  there's one point towards the end of the song  where everybody's in the chorus  if you listen real closely  right after they sing  we are the world  Uncle Paul goes  let's take our clothes off  see it's those little moments 
[02:54:30]  you gotta hear it again  there's also Uncle Paul  he has another line  it's hidden in there  but he says  there's a choice we're making  we're ruining all their lives  I didn't hear that either  it's in there  see that's fantastic  we'll play it  we'll definitely play it again  in a little while  we're gonna play it two more times  during the show  just so people could  listen to it  Bill in Texas  what's up  oh Bill  hello ONA Party Rock  awesome guys  awesome  I wanna know  where do I send the check  yeah I know 
[02:55:00]  people just hear that  and they just wanna donate  to something  yeah that is  the best piece of work  I've ever heard guys  you know as a goof  we wanted to put it online  and make people like  download it for like  whatever  yeah  and really send the money  to charity  but we found out  we're not allowed to do that  they don't want our money  I guess  how come we're not allowed  to do that though  a charity doesn't want our money  I wonder why  we're not allowed to do that  just as a goof  we put it up on iTunes  people would download it  just to help the damn Haiti thing out 
[02:55:30]  or maybe we do it  you know  help out America  or something  homeless or something  why not  but they said no  because why  we can never help  we don't own the rights  to the music  yeah but  we'll get fucking  Quincy Jones on the phone  it's charity  that's what I would think  and it's parody  it's parody charity  yeah  so parody  you can do  parody charity  is like protected right  what  hello  yeah  hold on  Stephen asks from Bayshore  exactly how long is that song  it seemed to last  about 19 minutes  Wayne and Boss and Bobo 
[02:56:00]  was just excellent  give him the nod  sounds a lot like  the retarded version  of Hungry Eyes  that's good  Keith from Philly  I heard Uncle Paul  scream children  yes  I love how brilliantly  it was edited  for the chorus  it sounded like  everyone stepped  all over each other  fucking hilarious  yeah it really was  just a cluster  when are you going to  play the O&A version  where's the video  this guy just writes  blink blink  hump axe  bravo boys  those fuckers  could produce  yeah 
[02:56:30]  so I don't know  I don't know  a lot more positive  than negative  coming in on this one  if you ask me  I say it's a hit  I think it's a hit  and I think  the people that are  bitching about it  are haters  they're just haters  and Evan  from Fort Drum  the small change  in E-Rock's voice  with Tank Hankerous  and the virus  was fucking hysterical  yeah that  my favorite part  right there  is the virus  and Tank Hankerous  and the absolute  impossibility  of distinguishing the two  but that's the beauty 
[02:57:00]  of a song like this  is everybody's going to  have a different  favorite part  and your favorite parts  are going to change  yes  and then you'll  notice things  that you missed  the first 18 times  people picking up on  Poe got in there  with us  a little us  was in there  I wanted to laugh  but I cried  it was that touching  what happened  to super affected mustard  mustard sounded  fucking great  I guess we got  a nice version  of mustard  this time around  he was our Bieber  he didn't do that  though  he went straight  in the chorus  yes  hidden in the chorus  great job  Troy Quart and Sam 
[02:57:30]  I love the  yeah okay  we did that one  Tippi Tom made it  Tippi Tom was in the end  I just pulled him  I put him in  singing  If You Want My Body  see I didn't even  notice that  I really got  I'm going to have  to listen  and I didn't notice  Tippi Tom in there  a tribute  he was the last voice  instead of an official  video  Blue Healer  I think everyone's  thinking this  Coke Logic's got  to animate that  that would be  a motherfucker  oh my god  yeah that would be  quite an undertaking  we can put up  a video of the recording 
[02:58:00]  to give Coke Logic  some time to animate it  okay we'll do that  oh would that be amazing  listen to the words  man  uh  got it out  as the other person  was already singing  the entire chorus  finally something 
[02:58:30]  that ranks lower  on Rotten Tomatoes  than Cop Out  we don't have time  to talk about Cop Out  today  I hate  I just want to see  it ticked up a notch  alright  it's up to 14%  positive reviews  uh  let's see  I'm absolutely crying  the review's just  coming in  and you want some  phone calls  go to Keith  the trucker  Keith  hey Keith  yeah  yeah guy  I'm absolutely  crying over here  that was fucking  hysterical man  they started  it up so serious  and sweet 
[02:59:00]  with uh  with the homeless dude  and they all went  to shit  and they had nothing  that was fucking great  I loved it  Kenny coming in  right after that  is just  that was perfect  really set the mood  that was perfect  my favorite part  might be Kenny  auto-tune  yeah  fucking great job  Sam  you need a pay raise  dude  yeah we gotta get  the overuse  of the auto-tune  too was really good  it was not subtle  pitches up  yeah yeah  it was not a subtle  use of  Kenny was walking  around here  dead serious  shaking his head  like I don't  want to be auto-tuned 
[02:59:30]  you're ruining my magic  he doesn't understand  how great it is  to have him auto-tuned  he made me sign  a napkin  that said he would  receive a thousand  dollars in cash  if he were auto-tuned  so I made him record it  and then I wiped  my ass with him  oh good  let's say hi  to trucker Brendan  trucker Brendan  hey guys  hey  I fucking love it  um  Opie I heard you  Kenny auto-tuned  is excellent  just like he did  in Fireflies  Anthony  did you have a solo  I was doing the 
[03:00:00]  um  if you notice  the uh  pseudo  Bruce Springsteen  yelling  in the chorus  that was awesome  the  he also did  Steve C  yeah  that was not  the actual  Steve C  Steve C  boys  see everyone's  saying they would  definitely pay  like whatever  a dollar or two  on iTunes  and we wouldn't  want the money  we'd fucking  make some money  for some dumb  charity  charity  I'll talk to the  lawyers and see  if there's any  way to get it up  uh

[03:01:00]  and uh  they're still  batting it around  deciding if we  could replay  something  that already  aired by the  way  do you know  so many people  are saying they  would absolutely  pay 99 cents  for it if it  goes to charity  you know  something  we gotta figure  out a way  we should  to uh  we could look  like good guys  for once  there was  no one ever  wants our  charity money  i know  there was one  get the black  homeless uh  minority  fucking  yeah minority  vietnam vets  yeah get them  they'll take our  money  there was one  person who had  a chance to be  on this recording  and said no

[03:06:30]  to appreciate  the brilliance  and beauty  and majesty  safe to say  i think we have  the second best  version of the  we are the world  song i think  a lot of people  out there are  doing their own  versions yes  i think this  beats the right  this there's the  first version  there's this  version and then  there's the 25th  anniversary yeah  which is forgettable  yeah this one  though wow  people asking  where was larry  king like like  sam said and  and and we can't  fit it all in  unfortunately i mean  we could have done  we are the world  with just anthony  doing voices  which we still 
[03:07:00]  could do  well  that's a very  short walk from  the studio to  the elevator  it would take a  while it's very  difficult yeah  uh well corinne  has something on  this uh corinne  in jersey corinne  guys i laughed  i cried i threw  up in my mouth a  little bit yeah  yeah that's the  feeling everybody's  getting what we  try to do is get  people to react i  don't care which  way you react just  react emotions  tim toronto  enough of these  toronto calls  today jesus you

[03:14:00]  didn't leave a number he  goes the guys want you to  call in click and then and  I live I live four minutes  away from the studio yeah  there's no way I'm calling  in no I could just walk up  here and I have nothing else  to do anyway I am a little  upset you are because I  heard some yes because all  upset I have a good friend  that I work with on a daily  basis named Jimmy Norton yes  I'm well aware there seems to  be some type of movie  production going on if you  want to call it that you have 
[03:14:30]  something to do with yes yes I'm  one of the producers yes the  producer and Jimmy Norton was  not even asked to participate  right in said movie right  which what is he a piece of  shite no no now then you  need okay this better be a good  excuse as to why he isn't being  utilized well you know what  happened and this is what I  found out yesterday  this is not you know we all you 
[03:15:00]  know me and Joe DeRosa and  Billy Burke came up with this  idea all right all right from  reality Joe wanted to cheat on  his girl and I sat with him for  a couple hours giving him all my  advice on how to cheat on a  bitch did you tell him that he  should fucking slide into the  room and sing I go from ranch to  riches with his fucking big  ragu hairdo or did you tell me  he could probably crawl into  something the size of a quarter  because he has no shoulders yes  you just slip it like a garden  snake and then you know whatever 
[03:15:30]  Billy Burke got involved we were  like you know you know we should  we there's a lot of funny shit  said we're like why don't we  just film it because we have  nothing going on at least me I  have nothing going on so why  don't we just film some of this  just yeah and then it got to the  point where you know Comedy  Central bought it and they were  going to do it and blah blah blah  and then we took it back because  Comedy Central wanted to own  everything yeah they do everything  so we took it back and said we're  gonna pay for it ourselves and Joe  had asked I want to direct it and  we were like you know what go  ahead you guys the little rascals 
[03:16:00]  well we're putting on a show  exactly and uh Joe is we let him  direct it and get everything  together because he wanted to and  uh I'm literally no I I got treated  on the first of all I didn't cast it  Joe cast it all right there it was  okay okay hold it after all the  talking you just did yeah I finally  heard you just pass the buck to Joe  but wait a second I go it was  basically I was thinking of this  you know Colin for the thing okay 
[03:16:30]  fine you know I mean because there's  only like six rolls in the whole  it's 15 minutes long there's six  rolls you have three of you yeah so  you needed three more people that we  needed this gets even better Colin and  who else Colin and then um Bonnie okay  because we needed a we needed a  mediocre chick that Joe could maybe  fuck oh fuck Jesus uh and then which  is great casting if you ask me and  then we have uh Jessica the girl from 
[03:17:00]  the cell the hallway who's the girl  that Joe wants to fuck right which is  you know never fucked him in high  school and now saw him do a comedy  show and wants to fuck him which is  totally believable all right okay and  then we got uh Voss is a doorman what  he's the doorman can't play well  because you weren't smart enough  tough enough he wouldn't allow Bonnie  to be in it unless he was was that  no because a towel we Joe originally  wanted to tell he had he had to tell 
[03:17:30]  to play the doorman but it tells a  flake and what didn't call him back  or whatever call anyone back now  what's wrong with Jimmy Norton being  the doorman absolutely but at the time  when we were casting this Jimmy is  first of all one of my only friends  is probably working all the time look  at look at Jimmy in the eye Jimmy's one  of my look at me Jim oh  oh Jim oh Jim he's making sad  pouty face he's the sweetest boy Jimmy 
[03:18:00]  Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy yeah Jim look at me  look at me okay just look at me look at the acting I um yeah look I can't be acting I would love to have you in the movie I really would be in the movie and I just didn't think you had the time because you're very busy going back and forth from LA and the TV in this show and all the other things you do but nobody asked yeah no one even asked about his schedule or anything that should be up to Jimmy to decide how come Joe would think that Dave has the time he has a better career than I do  how come Joe would think that Dave has the time he has a better career than I do he's more famous than I do why would Joe think that Colin Quinn has the time because he does this really sounds like a bunch of lies 
[03:18:30]  first of all first of all decision was made Colin Quinn has the time he does I mean I you don't Jim Jim huh Jim Jim I love you man but you left him out I didn't the whole I didn't production I'm not I'm I'm a producer you know what I am I'm money well the producer's technically in charge yeah that's what I thought until yesterday I almost fucking I almost got 
[03:19:00]  got into a fight I had all my rage all that respect shit you know I have respect you don't respect me I'll fucking I want to stab you in your fucking eyeball and fucking rip your fuck finally I'm on a movie set where I should be treated nice and not be fucked with treated like a piece of shit yeah the fuck I almost got a fight with the guy yesterday he oh he little passive aggressive little fuck he wanted me to sit in at this thing to sit you know for camera but now who is this the fucking assistant director 
[03:19:30]  oh he fucking this motherfucker he's got more power over you the producer no it was uh there was two things that happened yesterday that fucked me up I was looking at the monitor and he turned it I was like what is this what is that he goes just don't look at that and I almost got up and went don't you fucking I fucking bought that fucking monitor you but you know because I'm a psycho so I just said you know just chill out Bobby chill out yeah and then there was another thing where Billy has to open a door and I said Billy just give me two beats because it's a big steel door and I didn't want to get it in the face yeah and uh 
[03:20:00]  uh the guy was like you need to open it quicker well some somebody he Billy said somebody told me to open it slower and he goes whoever said that was wrong he knew I said it oh shit and I was like he don't like you well I go you know I said that's I was like dude if he opened the fucking door it would have hit me in the fucking face so who's wrong and that was like uncomfortable so now look at these fucking prima donnas oh dude but I had to great I had to pull I had to pull way back 
[03:20:30]  thank you oh it was terrible look at Joe it was terrible but I think what happened was is I don't think any of these people Joe hired because Joe did a lot of work he really busted his ass but I think all these people he hired think that he's the guy and he's the uh-huh I think they just answered one project right yeah well yeah what kind of uh what kind of equipment what is being uh put down it's a 15 minute film it's being put on the you know it's a good camera I mean look I was surprised yesterday how good it looked is it digital or is it uh film it's uh 
[03:21:00]  digital but if it's 15 minutes long could it be called a film short film yeah it can only be 15 minutes long to get in festivals any over you won't get in any festivals what a prick that DeRosa is yeah see let's get DeRosa on the phone now it's DeRosa now DeRosa gets called out and Garen fucking teed he passes the buck to Burr or something nah he won't I don't think DeRosa will get DeRosa on the phone he's not smart enough to pass the buck yeah he'll try to give it to himself he'll go come on man I just thought look I was gonna do it but then I realized I didn't like you I'd say he had a chip on his shoulder but 
[03:21:30]  I probably slipped right off he doesn't even have a shoulder on his shoulder I was on a bunch of shoulders one time  he's uh he's actually he actually doing a good job I mean he I saw it yesterday some of the footage Joe I really fucking surprised the shit out of me now is he is he really directing or is he assistant director or do you have a do you have a DP what do you have a director has to think of the whole movie before it beforehand 
[03:22:00]  put it all together sit down with the everybody his crew and then say this is what I want and figure out how to get it so he you know the shots and all this crazy shit he's putting in there and like the opening shot I was like that look I mean I was like fuck this looks kind of good I mean the content isn't you're not gonna be fucking I'm not let's just not get carried away you're not gonna it's not like everybody's gonna be like this should be a movie it's not gonna happen it's gonna it's gonna go to a couple festivals 
[03:22:30]  no why would it what have I ever done for DeRosa exactly I didn't I didn't uh I didn't host an HBO show that him and Burr were on  no I tried to get Bob on but I couldn't because it was Comedy Central and you know what when you were out we never had him sit here so we could plug gigs  no not at all I had nothing to do with that  I thought I wasn't on HBO special because of the tourgasm thing  oh was that it I think there was a lot of bridges burned in HBO for tourgasm and all that shit 
[03:23:00]  well I would honestly what I was told was was Comedy Central and there was other people they  vetoed that were Comedy Central that had just done Comedy Central and uh at least that was what I  heard from the women who I don't think would have bullshitted me I mean uh but that was what they  said nobody just did Comedy Central because they wanted HBO's content to be different right anyways  Jimmy I would have loved to have you in the movie all right we go to DeRosa now we'll get to the bottom  of this oh we better want to take a break get uh Joey on the phone hopefully yeah he's not too busy 
[03:23:30]  just not get that picture it's perfect he's filming right now with Bonnie big star like right now he's  filming Bonnie scene right now well fucking he could he could put down the camera yeah why would  he say hey hey my friend who's been nice to me that's right I'm doing a movie maybe I put a little  parts a little hey yeah okay we better get his uh ass on the phone and the second you did did you  just say DeRosa's working right now on the film so we can't call in no no no no no I just let you know  what he's doing no no it I didn't I didn't and I don't have any but you said he's busy no I said 
[03:24:00]  he's work well I mean is I'm just letting you know that what he's doing let me just let you know  something okay a little director by the name of Kevin Smith ah who did put Jimmy in a couple of  fucking movies can you put you say real movie at the end of that was able to call our show right  during the time he was working so I think Joe scumbag fuck DeRosa can uh maybe uh uh get get away  from his 1988 camcorder I want a fucking uh I'll call the show exactly he's actually making it on 
[03:24:30]  tape I want I want it to be my agent that rocks man no one kicks around a little Jimmy it's like an  old school agent that's it Joe DeRosa went to voicemail we tried to call him so he never liked me Joe he  never liked me no he doesn't he knows I'm funny but now he doesn't he never like me no he likes you  no he doesn't you can tell I just he likes me mildly and casually the way you like a mild casual person  I'll tell you what Joe's problem is and this is what it is when every even everybody we asked they 
[03:25:00]  didn't even this is the weird part too is you do this shit movie and Dane actually got fucking mad  that I didn't put him in it I'm like are you fucking like people get fucked up like it's like why  wouldn't you put me in your movie because it's such a shit when you make it you're like this is bullshit  I don't even want to insult somebody honest to god didn't you say hold on what you said  about when festival hold on we don't pick up on everything unfortunately on this show  greg on long island go ahead hit bobby with some knowledge I want to make sure I heard this right

[03:32:30]  kelly is throwing our wonderful director under the bus on your great program completely throwing uh  both of you is pretty much under the bus billy we're producing me and billy produces you said  billy is pretty much like i don't know i don't care whatever whatever whatever so when when jim  norton i found out that little jimmy norton was not going to be part of this project and wasn't even  asked i wanted to know from bobby why and what had happened was there any dialogue uh uh uh that that 
[03:33:00]  included jimmy and he said joe de rosa's fault pretty much just it's not what i said you threw  de rosa understand about bobby bobby kelly is a survivor thank you in there and he's just like  well i'm not taking the hit i'll just dump it on de rosa he went on for yeah in los angeles during all  of this so i missed all i have right now is i'm actually a messenger here bringing the official 
[03:33:30]  statement from joe de rosa oh is this the official yeah well we gave out his twitter account so i  guess he found out  come back  about him and to bobby and bobby said dude fucking norton's not going to do it if he doesn't have a  bunch of lines dude don't waste his fucking time oh bobby goes back to bobby all right let's get it back 
[03:34:00]  hang on you're saying that what bobby is saying then is that jimmy is incapable of improvisation no  no no no and and just what's going on like what i stated before is bobby kelly's a survivor and the  second jim norton i mean uh joe de rosa brought up having the wonderfully talented jim norton  there's no way i'm going to be sitting across such a dynamic stage presence as jim norton  ah look at his legs out there and then he goes on the radio and then he cuts to roses 
[03:34:30]  a train a train 11 hit it right on the head bobby equals jay leno see what you're doing  apparently bill's a survivor too this is a fucking great i think jim norton's a really talented guy  he just wasn't getting the ratings  oh so okay it's back on bobby man hat and coat yet we're going to need it at like 12  that's it's 10 15 doorman uh that would be rich voss playing the doorman right yeah rich voss  really dealing with here is it's nobody's fault it's really a budget thing all we can afford is 
[03:35:00]  guys like rich voss for free and bobby to work for free that's what's really going on here there's  no reason to trash people there bobby what are you doing we're trying to get good press here  it's true bob i didn't say anything way to go bob i was just trying i said joe's doing a great job  i said joe's doing a great fantastic job surprisingly is a cancer on the set of a movie  i would just say he's a polyp do it in 3d it'll fucking be huge that's what it is in 3d i am 
[03:35:30]  no  plus his teeth would scare everybody in 3d what are one of us lines what are one of us lines  go ahead i have no idea oh stop you do i swear it's an annoying doorman yeah he basically yeah  he says i'll get that for you this very minimal line i'll get that for you what you think i  couldn't do that i'll for that no no no no no no no no no if you if you're going to be in a movie  you're going to be in a movie i have one line and i'm a one and done guy yeah it's in my contract i 
[03:36:00]  can do nothing that will get me recognition or further my career one line in spider-man one line  in zach and miri and three or four or maybe five lines in a in a cop out i thought you'd co-starred  in spider-man no that i actually was why didn't you want jim in the movie yeah what happened yeah  what is your beef with now it's on you again i didn't i yeah listen listen to his fucking creepy  evil laugh did you put dane in the movie he put you in a movie yeah and then he cut me right out of  it i don't think de rosa wanted me in either though de rosa never liked me no it had nothing to do 
[03:36:30]  with that i think that at the beginning of this movie we couldn't it was literally like nothing  in there for him and it wasn't nothing in there there's nothing if what are you gonna do give  him one fucking thing and be nothing like a background player be a friend at least be a  boy is you gonna sit in the background it's new york i could sell peanuts in the movie  fucking voss louis beans you've seen him act it's horrible but i couldn't be there while you guys  are talking one time and do one or two lines and then get out yeah like when i walk out the audience 
[03:37:00]  applauds like when fucking tim conway would walk out on marriage however yes exactly i say billy i  say we actually put norton in something no i wouldn't do it now my feelings are very hurt  billy would you have a sensitive man what do you say billy i i feel terrible that we've uh that we've  somehow uh ruined our relationship with jim norton jim this is what i swear to god there's like there's  like five parts of this i know yeah well four uh i don't think we should why don't we why don't 
[03:37:30]  we just fire voss today that's i mean it's hot it's showbiz dude we fire him and we throw him  no jimmy ain't not jimmy ain't taking what are you his agent let me talk to the front he might do it  just to see voss get fired anthony all right now you made a good point now we had some controversy  to the film survivor now he's putting it on boss no i'd actually like to see norton play more than  boss it'd be a fucking way better hit no more people would fucking want to see this movie i know 
[03:38:00]  how do you not want a built-in guy like jim norton who has a built-in audience here on this program  talk about the film and everything it's it even makes bad business sense never mind fucking a friend  over i agree i didn't fuck let's not down sell last comic standing here that's what you said  that's how you put it i didn't put it that way oh you're the worst the rose has always been very  anti-jim norton no he loves you no he doesn't love you what really happened is we had too much respect 
[03:38:30]  for you no that's true no they don't have to tell we want to come to you and go can you do half a  line that's going to take you know an hour and a half to shoot because we're trying to be all artsy  fartsy with the angle for the camera you know you're a busy man it really had nothing to do with  that he's exactly he's absolutely right i would have been honored i said that to opie it's it's you  just want to be asked to be in it and then turn it down sometimes and then turn it down it's like 
[03:39:00]  it's like when you get asked i get asked anything ever exactly i don't even get phone calls from you  robert i call you all the time dude dude dude guy lives in la for a month and he's duding me  no i've been duding my whole fucking life how you don't know me on the radio you know what dude so  what russell sells out everywhere dude i got my friends dude i got my family people love me  that's fine but yeah he's absolutely right i really feel bad though no why i really do i just wanted to 
[03:39:30]  call up because i know bob's not exactly the greatest delegate to send out to your show with  jim yeah i'm actually flattered that you'd even want to be in it but you know it was  we just didn't want to waste your time dude having you come over there  doing a line and a half like i said that was going to take an hour and a half to shoot you know i mean  you're in spider-man for christ's sake you're not going to do a little shit movie i certainly would  with my friends who i like to be a part of creatively do your shit movie i certainly would 
[03:40:00]  i would have your scat film exactly i'd be happy to at least clean off the glass coffee table  in between shoots and fucking diuretics how great would it be they're actually filming a snuff  film yeah boss is the star yeah yeah well i think then jim could actually truly be offended if we  wouldn't invite him to come down to participate in the snuff film yeah yeah all right mr burr i'll  see it like everybody else at the festivals the parties yeah the parties all right billy i'll be 
[03:40:30]  over in a little while with the hat and coat cool yeah don't say like it isn't important bob  i'm not i'm fucking i'm on it all we have is rich rich boss standing there looking stupid  that's what we have anyways with a hat and coat  you're the producer all right bill burr i will take it easy man  what's uh joe de rosa calling for joe what's up joe it's the traitorous joe de rosa  jesus god almighty man everything was was uh good in my life yesterday and then uh i got two thousand 
[03:41:00]  fucking tweets oh that's cool that's good i mean you're popular you're popular twitter congrats  man yeah these are yeah these i wouldn't say that these are popular tweets why crossovers like maybe  from fans of uh uh maybe me or or danny or or jimmy norton or someone like that um i don't know would  one of your fans say go fuck a camel you egyptian camel fucker piece of shit  oh okay i i could see that happening is that something like a follow-up yours might say 
[03:41:30]  yeah actually yes um yes that means they love you you just don't know the translation yet  i thought i could i thought i could read you read you guys some of the best tweets that i got oh cool  yeah well let's uh catch people up here get people up to speed you are doing a film are you doing this  without a talent coach anthony this is amazing yes i learned this from amazing you have to reboot 
[03:42:00]  uh the audience it's going to be doing what's called a reset right this is something nick cannon  will eventually learn with his talent coach yes joe de rosa is making a film and uh bill burr the  lovely and talented bill burr is in it uh rich voss and bonnie will be appearing joe de rosa will be in  it uh robert kelly will be in it and um something happened where jim norton wasn't even asked to be 
[03:42:30]  in it uh which insulted jim norton uh insulted me and to the point jim just walked out of the studio  jim just doesn't even want to talk to you he he looked he said he mouthed de rosa i nodded my head  yes he got up and walked out of the fucking studio you're not gonna hear jim norton are you kidding  jim walked out he walked out he is not sitting listen to the replay he was on the show the  entire day and he will not be talking he said joe de rosa and then like took his headphones off  threw his eyes up and left uh they well let me let me just say this we spoke with the lovely bill 
[03:43:00]  burr we spoke with robert kelly who was trashing the movie by the way yeah and you we could send  you the tape if you like yeah uh and he he put the blame on you uh bill burr kind of said hey i'm out  here in la i don't know what the fuck is going on uh and um you you pretty much have the blame now for  saying well you know we're not even going to ask jimmy okay all right well well i mean it's so unlike 
[03:43:30]  bobby to throw another guy under the bus completely that's true to uh to save his own ass so it's just  recently that bobby can fit under a bus so give him some some credit that is true that is true  bobby could not fit under a fucking bus yeah i could still do older bobby was fat jokes which i like  uh you know he's not exactly thin right now he's uh he's entering into i believe his sixth fatness 
[03:44:00]  yeah he says he's got seven seven fats in him he said this is his sixth one he's gonna get back  in shape and then he says he has like one maybe two more fats left and that's it for his life i would  uh but i just i'd describe him right now right now he's dom de louise on the dean martin show he was  dom de louise on cannonball run so he goes through phases of dom de louise he's down to the skinniest  dom de louise which is still kind of fat yeah the skinny incarnation uh now now what uh 
[03:44:30]  what happened why isn't jimmy in your your film uh i'll tell you why because we didn't have a part  and then bobby said we were we we had the doorman doorman don't don't talk like i don't know everything  about this situation rich voss is playing the stupid doorman and and i think uh just because  bonnie is in the movie doesn't mean you gotta trail that uh guy around uh and put him in the movie 
[03:45:00]  well from from the lips of bobby kelly to my ears six months ago dude you know norton you know we  shouldn't ask norton to be in it dude because it's really not a huge part so you know i don't want to  like like fucking waste his time because he's doing a lot of big shit and you know like it's not really  a huge part like if there was something bigger we would ask jim but it's not that big so we shouldn't 
[03:45:30]  there it is passing the buck there it is he's gonna be in tomorrow the ball now in kelly's court  uh that's exactly what he said you said he is so full of shit he had the idea initially to ask jimmy  to be in it he said first we can get norton if we want and i said okay and then when i said you know  dude like what's up do you think norton would want to do this part or do you think it's too small like 
[03:46:00]  what do you think that was what he said to me you know dude it's kind of small and it's not really a  big pot and that's that was his exact fucking word don't you but don't you think though like like just  because he's he's a friend and and and hangs out and like just to even be asked would have been nice  for little and that's why jimmy's not talking to you right now i'm i'm he's outside the studio and  we can't get him back in i've been waving like wait a minute flips us the bird nothing can you  tell him please i feel terrible i can't i gotta be honest with you guys and this speaks to my low 
[03:46:30]  self-esteem i'm shocked that jim even cares to be honest with you he's not talking and he just gave  we all seen the face he just gave the nah nah nah face nah nah but it's it's just like being asked  would have been like he just wanted to be asked but also too you guys nodding his head and giving a  thumbs up to that by the way and i would think for you guys like obviously all right we're not you  know uh uh uh the the next best thing since sliced bread but i mean to have jimmy in there it would 
[03:47:00]  have been promoted a lot more and stuff i don't know it just it seems like you really went to on an  effort to to not put him in this movie jimmy jimmy just pulled his pants down pushed his fucking ass  against the glass and opened up his asshole for you he left a sweaty pucker mark on the window  no it was fucking jimmy you guys did bobby also explain fully that this is not my movie  oh now he's disavowing any knowledge of the movie i think bill burr who was actually uh brave enough 
[03:47:30]  to call yesterday when all this was going down said that this was your movie idea yep no no that you  had the initial uh idea yeah it was like your movie no no bob bill and me were equal partners in  this we created just the three of us so if any heat's coming down it should fall on the three of  us equally he bobby said he's a producer you are the director of this movie you're the one that  really grabbed the ball uh you he said you were in charge of casting oh well let me ask you gentlemen 
[03:48:00]  something yes who's usually in charge of casting not a director a casting director which falls under  the producer umbrella so where was mr kelly producing the producer's the guy that comes  along goes here's what we need this part to look like we need a guy like this here that's a producer  job did bobby do any of that no he did show up with water yesterday that was a nice producer  duty he fulfilled but did he step in and be a producer and say i want jim norton in this role 
[03:48:30]  no he didn't no he fucking did what do you do for a living character character uh did the suit make  it did the doorman suit make it on time because i know that was make it make it on time only because  bill burr had to yell at him about it on the air you know what because that was a part of bobby's  responsibility too i believe and joe you got other problems too man because and i are ready to do  movies and this would have been a nice place to start a little 15 mil uh 15 minute independent film 
[03:49:00]  i got some action chops let me tell you something i'd have been willing to maybe contribute into the  production uh cost myself for a small part that's right we're not asking for much i want to just walk  through a scene that's it mr de rosa i will not do that picture it's out of the question out of the  question i'll be i'll be not not to correct you on your own show but it's it's not a 15 minute film  uh according to uh some of these twitter feeds it's a 15 minute piece of shit fuck film 
[03:49:30]  and i should get aged for it all right all right well that leads into uh let's hear some of the  the tweets from our fine fans to you i believe they were tagging it fuck joe de rosa by the way  just want to remind you that was going down joe let's uh yeah read off some of the uh some of  your favorites there joe uh nice pick you faggot your mouth looks like it's all blown out from  taking uncut meat sticks why didn't you put little jimmy in your movie hey cancer arms 
[03:50:00]  why didn't you bill burr and robert kelly put fancy jim norton in your 15 minute waste of film  uh i searched a dumpster at the clinic to find that abortion of a new movie that you won't put jim  i think they let you off easy to be honest with you yeah really no no they're they get worse oh 
[03:50:30]  really get aids cunt uh fuck hold on just scroll through these uh there's all this shit in here  about hats taking off your hat i don't know what that means oh wow there's a habitable service that  yeah you should be uh calling up there's a large uh gentleman of color that would go around to  elderly women and punch them in the face yeah uh and the news said to rob them but we all knew 
[03:51:00]  it was just a hat removal service that he was uh the lady didn't pay for the hat and the guy  needed to remove uh bob kelly's on the phone oh so uh please work today bob yes all right you  were just completely thrown under the bus by joe de rosa who is on the phone also and uh he said  that you're the one that said let's not ask jimmy norton because he won't do the part of well  whatever the reason is but you're responsible yeah you're responsible for jimmy not being in the 
[03:51:30]  movie and uh bob just so you know jimmy walked off our show he doesn't want to talk to joe  uh this is the thing is i can't believe on a little independent film you guys have fucking  got into it and ruined it we'll never work together again wait what you've caused controversy on our  little fucking happy project i have been happy controversy you you hear the weather went on the  radio yesterday it started all this i want to hear a nice day and then all of a sudden i'm getting 
[03:52:00]  called a fucking camel moly on my fucking twitter on my phone that had nothing to do with what we're  talking about yet uh somebody randomly tweeting you bobby i want to know what you i want to know  your your response to the fact that joe de rosa completely completely turned around what you said  yesterday he pretty much said the exact same thing you said only turned it around on you okay well i  think what basically happened was i wanted to put norton in the movie i suggested norton and there was a 
[03:52:30]  one part that had like one line i was like no we need to give norton lines we need norton needs to  say something he can't just be in the background he has to say something you know people want to hear  nothing to see him they want to hear him say some shit and be funny they're comments you gotta allow  them to be funny yeah i don't think there was i don't think there was anything for him to do so now  you didn't answer my question are you agreeing then with joe are you agreeing then with joe de rosa that  you were the one that said no to jimmy norton no i didn't say no someone said no to jimmy norton 
[03:53:00]  his name his name was brought up he's not in the movie at some point someone had to say no  bobby bobby brought his name up bobby said he needs to talk bobby said what bobby said what he just said  which is a reiteration of what i said that he said so we're on the same page and here's what  everybody's missing here's what all these fucking twitter cocksuckers are missing we didn't ask him  out of respect for his time oh that's good yeah don't don't ask him out of respect you just fucking 
[03:53:30]  alienate him as a friend it's too bad that it's too bad you can't tell that to jimmy personally but he  doesn't want to talk to you guys so he's making the universal signal of as he because he's listening  but he's making the universal signal for air jerking off which means bullshit is that what that means  yeah yeah you know when you jerk off in the air i want to know what i want to know what i want to  know about me what i heard he said some other shit about me he was trashing me he said i wasn't he 
[03:54:00]  said you're not a you're not a uh yeah you were in charge of casting because you're the producer and  then he called you fat and he also said all you did was bring water to the set or something yeah  you brought water to the set which was just about all you do this is this is how this is how serious  joe's taking himself yesterday he yelled quiet to everybody and colin went nobody was talking  oh colin's involved too i forgot yes colin quinn's involved too yet jimmy norton uh sits uh out  anthony can you anthony can you shoot your scene on monday is that good for you yeah that's fine 
[03:54:30]  what time though it's gotta be 12 o'clock after the show right after though because i gotta get  out of uh new york you got it let's get down let's get down to the bare bones of what happened  yesterday bobby my good buddy bobby kelly like one of my good tight fucking friends went on the show  the night before was sitting there with me going we're partners dude we're good buddies dude i love  i never said buddy i don't even talk like that dude sounded exactly like that and he went on the

[04:04:00]  packing for mars by mary roach that talks about uh what it's like to be an astronaut which i didn't know  that being an astronaut is breathing shit and vomit with every breath shit and vomit floats through  the air and that uh psychologically guys were trained professionally trained to deal with each 
[04:04:30]  other after six months end up punching each other in the face and they're talking about sending people  to mars which is 500 days round trip never opening a window breathing your and other people's shit and  vomit and piss constantly they get they get uh e coli fecal infections in their fucking noses kill  yourself just kill yourself and they uh their bones deteriorate they fall to pieces and there are people 
[04:05:00]  right now in the united states who are not crazy who i there's no evidence they're crazy who have said  they will take a one-way trip to mars one way deliver me to mars and i'll live there and try to send me  rockets with air and food and if you fail okay i'll die there whatever i'll just but i'm reading this book  i'm reading this book and all of a sudden my house which is over 10 000 square feet is too claustrophobic 
[04:05:30]  because it's like those first you know the the gemini guys and stuff and the apollo guys  they were sitting in you know a small volkswagen yeah the mercury capsule you guys alone and pissing  into their own suit for like four or five days and the helmet on just filling with their own funk  and they there's guys that test this is a job for you there are guys there are guys that get the job 
[04:06:00]  testing who aren't astronauts but get the job of lying in bed for a hundred days without sitting up  to see their bones deteriorate and drinking through straws and all they do is measure their own shit  and what they eat and he doesn't even get the glory of being the guy no glory but they love helping the  space program and uh there are people that have been locked in rooms five person teams in a smaller 
[04:06:30]  room than this for 500 days can i imagine this all these windows just stop and we are in here  for 500 days let me how soon before we kill each other let me jump in here for a second so you're  you're saying when they stepped on the moon for the first time their spacesuits were filled with  shit yes didn't they have any kind of way to fucking to clean that out they don't they sort  of have uh things they could do now but they have never going back to 1969 they have never found a 
[04:07:00]  zero g toilet right that works that glorious moment they were filled with shit it turns out that when  you are uh evacuating your bowels a big part of what gets it to vac from your bowels is gravity and  without gravity it just kind of hangs there and they have to scoop it out of each other's asses  and then they have to put it in a bag and they have to put pills in the bag and then squeeze it up 
[04:07:30]  squeeze it so that the pills go in there otherwise it will ferment and blow up the bag and pop and fill  the air that's all around you with shit this book is wow is the most nightmare book and i don't think  i was reading this stuff going i don't think i could sit in the capsule for 15 minutes yeah and then we  none of this is mentioned then there's a rocket on your ass and they're blowing into space where your 
[04:08:00]  chances of dying are as high as anything you've ever done right and they talk about how the astronauts  thoughts on the uh on the apollo program would not eat or eat just cheese so that they wouldn't shit  for like eight days in space why don't they do something like you ever get a colonic if you've  got a solution to this it would be really cool my guess would be why can't they do something like a  colonic with water like if you've got if you've gotten them it does filter you back through the 
[04:08:30]  you're using pressure so why not do that every other day yeah but it does work it's like without  any effort you're lying on your back the water's being pumped in it cleans you out and it pulls the  fecal matter out with you nothing with the water i would like nothing more in my life than for that  sentence to win you a nobel prize i would love it i would love to see you in stockholm in the tuxedo  going james norton they all clap here he is i was just talking on the radio yes you know it wasn't 
[04:09:00]  long ago i was talking on the radio about you know and of course let's go let's go to our nobel  laureate yes jim norton for the news but why wouldn't that uh that would not a bad idea right you put a  little fucking hose you put a little hole in the back of the suit call NASA let's call him right now  we got the solution NASA on the blower let's do the back of your suit but i can't i can't get  i can't get past the fact that they had shit in their space suits when they're stepping on the moon 
[04:09:30]  that's why they walk so awkwardly right jumping around yeah they're jumping around because their  asses it's so fucking bad if you vomit in your suit which you always do it stops your visibility  and then you can't get your hands to your face to wipe it out of your nose and it's floating i've been  zero g i went on the vomit comet i went zero g and i get this idea i was i went with billy gibbons  which seems odd zz top zz top yeah so it's me zz top and test pilots it was an illegal flight that 
[04:10:00]  we took we we went illegally with a guy who had an air mexico 747 and said he'd do the parabola  747 and what you do to do zero g is you do parabolas just like that that's up and down  like almost like a heart monitor it looks like yeah yeah so you're uh so we did it over the ocean  and you know the pilot's just trying to go straight down so i had decided i was on with two astronauts  and some test pilots and i had decided you know the movie barbarella sure sure yes i had decided that 
[04:10:30]  what i wanted what billy gibbons wanted to do was he wanted to bring an amp and a guitar i saw this  video by the way it's hilarious and it's zero g he wanted to play the guitar look this up that was that  was his that was his yeah dream everyone had something they wanted my dream yeah you know my  dream was to do the striptease from barbarella the beginning of barbarella jane fonda goes barbarella  psychedela kind of like a conch shell of love and she's stripping but she's on glass she's on like 
[04:11:00]  a damey thomas glass and she's never let that down she's moving she's moving around like that  and she's not really weightless so i said to the astronauts i want to do a um i want to do a striptease  and i want to sing barbarella and billy gibbons said okay i'll play a little guitar and my hair was  much longer than because i've cut it off for locks of love but it was much longer than as long as jane  fonda's in barbarella now the similarities between me and jane fonda and barbarella may end at hair 
[04:11:30]  yeah yeah you get it right here you get it right here they got me floating around here take a ride  on the nasa what year is that how long ago i don't know much in the 90s sometimes there's me and billy  and uh and so i'm doing that and when i start stripping right the astronauts don't really  understand that when i say i'm going to strip i'm going to strip down fully naked so what you do  is you've got 35 seconds of zero g then you got 35 seconds of two g and zero g is exhilarating you 
[04:12:00]  weigh nothing this 300 pound fat fuck weighs zero it's terrific but at two g's i weigh 600 you can't  get something for nothing and it's just depressing and horrible and miserable how sick did you get down  on the ground that's where the story is going to get on the floor like you get on the floor get on  the floor and then you can't even lift your arms really so i'm doing barbarella barbarella and this  astronaut he's a fucking astronaut which i figure if you're an astronaut and you've been breathing  other people's piss shit and vomit you're not going to be very squeamish about things right but 
[04:12:30]  somehow he's holding the video camera somehow he's a little surprised when i actually do take my  underwear off throw it in the air and little houdini is flapping in the breeze weightless little  houdini and i'm singing the barbarella so i'm trying to do the barber and in my head because i am a  psychopath in my head i really do look exactly like jane fonda but the way the astronauts are reacting 
[04:13:00]  i don't think i do no no their reaction your reaction if jane fonda 1968 were floating in front  of your weightless turns out is very different from your reaction right you look more like the  tank she sat on so you have to now be totally naked in two g's laying on the floor well that's where it  goes so i took off my belt and i swung my belt around because that's part of being a sexy stripper  and my dad had just died a year before and had given me a belt that he had with a silver dollar 
[04:13:30]  in it when i swung the belt around and hit the fuselage and the silver dollar came out and somehow  somehow i didn't understand in my panic in my zero g that the fuselage was closed and we just find that  you're not going to lose it right i'm not going to lose the coin that my father gave me i love my dad  if the coin gets outside you've got more problems so i go running naked no kidding i go running naked  now for the for the coin and all the astronauts are going we're going to 2g get down get down and i go 
[04:14:00]  no no i want to get this coin they go get down find it later get down i go no no i want to get i can  see bam and i hit the fuselage at 2g naked flat on my flat on my face and i now weigh 600 pounds yeah  and the coin which weighs a pound it's in my hand that i've got it but i haven't been sitting in the  right position so now they go 35 seconds of that oh no oh no with the astronauts crawling to me to make 
[04:14:30]  sure i'm okay and then okay we're going zero g so now i float in the air now i'm disoriented now i'm  holding the coin and now i am vomiting into my long hair while i'm naked and the astronaut is holding  me and he goes hey you're not singing barbarella now are you horrible scene does everyone vomit on  that thing does i mean hence the name no i was not going to vomit until i was stupid and went after 
[04:15:00]  that coin from my dad so when you get down you're in the wrong position and how does the pilot fly  that thing oh my god you just you know i understand that but how does he keep uh he's strapped in and  control if it goes to 2g's when he can't really move himself oh yeah well that's that's the thing  there's there's there's astronauts who have come in and pulling those guys yeah and at 8g's you can't  pick your fingers up your fingers are too heavy to just kill yourself if you ever get you know if 
[04:15:30]  somehow they say you guys are accepting the space program kill yourself you're not going to enjoy  it you're not going to enjoy how long was the trip for that's pretty interesting i did uh well that's  the thing the first uh eight parabolas are the greatest thing in the world we did 30 oh so actually  we were completely weightless for 50 you know 15 minutes damn but with we were also 2g's for 15 minutes  they did that in apollo 13 the movie they built a little set inside one of the uh the set of the 
[04:16:00]  lunar module and the command module inside the fuselage of one of these planes and did that so  many times yeah they get all these shots so it didn't look like the old-fashioned on a string or  you know shit like that it looked weightless because they were weightless and you know the  interesting thing was tom tom hanks did not strip naked and sing barbara no he didn't but what would  you if you were going to be weightless what's the first thing you the first thing you would think  yeah ron howard did though when he was filming it he would think i want to fuck in zero g right  and i did think that and there was an attractive woman like a test pilot on there with uh with 
[04:16:30]  aftermarket breasts and very very attractive and i said to her uh we're we're going to be in zero g  i'm going to be stripping naked doing barbarella billy's going to be playing guitar but do you want  to fuck sounds romantic would that be fun ask it and she says to me um well you know i i might i yeah i like  i certainly like to go out with you after today i said we're not going after today what the fuck is  wrong with you i don't want to have dinner with you next week i don't want to call you this is a 
[04:17:00]  science experiment this is two hamsters in a cage that's floating in the river this is not this is  to see what it'll feel like to fuck somebody and your position would be somebody she goes well you know  i just i don't know if i'm comfortable i don't want you to be comfortable we're going to be in zero g  you're not going to be comfortable do you want my penis in you that's it doesn't matter do you want  anybody here as a matter of fact pick somebody anybody here will fuck you i'll watch i'll be happy 
[04:17:30]  you know except you smooth talk to them there's no time for smooth talk you're going to be you're  going to be weightless you only have 35 seconds how long to get it done yeah 35 seconds  like that though could you get a cock your cock hard and zero gravity yes i'd like to see what  it feels like during the two g's and how deep you could get in oh god your cock could be so heavy  your cock weighs four pounds it's a heavy cock although i would think the whole you have a good  time to go in 30 seconds you're going to be weightless oh you get a little something in your eye 
[04:18:00]  yeah but undo your hair a little bit oh my without your glasses you're beautiful  no time for that let's fuck yeah let's fuck quick i think with every action as an equal and  opposite reaction would be kind of a little rough some people some people believe see i have fucked  40 feet below water uh in scuba equipment scuba equipment i have done that and it's very hard to  keep your neutral buoyancy yeah it's very hard to be safe and i also almost froze her to death because 
[04:18:30]  you know i have much more body mass and she was a skinny model so if there was there were some parts  of her body that looked kind of blue as we were but i've done that so you know i knew you could do  the pushing and stuff but i also knew billy gibbons would help he's a rock and roll sure could you get a  ride under those circumstances i could never do that you could too no i couldn't i'm very specific  very distractive very just yeah yeah we could bring in the horse porno  yes good old kenny pinion yes naughty balling engineer he was what makes you scared man because 
[04:19:00]  you do everything does anything scare you where you're like get the fuck out of here i'm not doing  that you know i don't tend to get i know you don't get that i've learned that over the years with you  i also thought of the mary roach who wrote the book um uh uh about mars packing for mars i wrote to  her family i write fan letters like crazy but they're not just fan letters like go on oh and a  i said you know i like what you're doing old school fan old school yeah i do that and uh she had been 
[04:19:30]  zero g and she does this whole chapter which is about fucking in space where she says the the desire  to do it is so overwhelming someone must have done it but the danger of being caught and how  reprimanded you would be nobody could have done it so it's completely powerful  and she said when she got on her zero g flight she said to a guy there let's just fuck let's just  do she was doing the same thing that i was doing absolutely if we were on the same flight we could 
[04:20:00]  have negotiated that deal zero fucking going on the second parabola the every astronaut would be  breathing piss shit vomit and my cum and some cum and vaginal secretions sure whatever else uh  but i mean it's the first thing you think about right and i'll tell you just so you know if you  and i are ever in zero g i'm fucking you i'd jerk you off at least out of respect you would yeah i  mean if you're talking about the purpose of life you know in a godless universe is to get good 
[04:20:30]  stories yeah and i don't think you can beat i jerked up jim norton in zero g it's not gay if  you're in zero g no there's no gravity all rule all bets are off but i mean that would be a great  story story yeah you jerk each other off you laugh about it later we're sure we're all in agreement  you know and he's got how many questions have you got what was it like when you came how did that feel  yeah i would never be able to come you know awful it'd be to fucking collapse and have his  his hand still on my cock in two g's i can't get your hand off my dick i can't lift my hand 
[04:21:00]  i can't lift my hand then you look at each other and go wow this is really gay  my hand is stuck and then we start vomiting yeah and then we land and they have to pry us apart  that just sounds like a great great story man a good date right that's good but jimmy you guys  they're starting to do it's no longer illegal and sneaking around they'll now do it for like  rich guys do the problem yeah yeah i don't know if i have the balls to do it i'll get very very sick 
[04:21:30]  i don't like to think i do but you get sick sure but it's worth it you're zero g you're like uh  you ever skydive i haven't skydived is that something you're scared of sky  you know now you do it on someone's back right they do that yeah they strap you on and save you  having to learn anything yeah you ever see the video of the guy who jumps out without a parachute  and then they have the guy has to jump after him with the parachute yeah he's like a stunt guy yeah  and uh he jumps out and he just fucking takes a sip of an energy jink and jumps out of the

[04:30:30]  how dare you act like such a bitch when i'm being so fucking nice  i did not blame you you said i was mean you were fucking annoyed at me for what reason  what i did nothing but be nice to you what i've done nothing but be nice to you 
[04:31:00]  i didn't blame you last night  i wasn't i wasn't doing anything  mel is being a little unreasonable  we've been saying it all along we're amazed that mel gibson has to put up with this shit  he's mel he's mel fucking gibson but it's the old mel gibson now  oh yeah with the dry hair it's not i forgot not road warrior not the not the moist max mad max 
[04:31:30]  his hair's a little dry  i wasn't gonna say about any earlier today it's just  i was gonna say about last night that's all  why because i let you sleep  that's my fucking mistake i should have woke you up and said fucking blow me bitch  i should have fucking woken you up and said blow me  you would like that better yeah  you need the goddamn sleep 
[04:32:00]  we were supposed to go to jacuzzi and you said you have to wait for something  so why did you have to wait  you said  you go to the goddamn jacuzzi  i'm afraid it's dark outside  fuck it  this is how you know this is not all her  every time she does make a point which anyone will do  mel dismisses it  she went about that and mel was like fuck it  well it's dark outside i'm scared 
[04:32:30]  fuck it  get out there blow me  all mel is doing is throwing roundhouse punches  and every time she effectively blocks one instead of going oh okay  you blocked one  he just backs up and goes all right  and then uppercuts  he's just looking for ends  but she's attacking him with what annoys him  is her lack of  her just her lack of humanity  no  he's so mad  well she has her agenda  you said we will go to jacuzzi  we go to jacuzzi 
[04:33:00]  yeah  but if that wasn't how  if that wasn't how she argued  then he would go  what the bitch  what is this  are you taping me  yeah yeah  that's true  like that's what she does  yeah  she was actually was being her  fun mel  dismissive  jacuzzi  it's all nice when they were in the sweetheart phase you know mel that's wonderful that you do for me i love you i love you too it's wonderful fabulous and then it's just like oh mel i always go to jacuzzi 
[04:33:30]  why would that be a problem  i don't know he's mad though  he's mad about the jacuzzi  she started getting rights  yes  somewhere in that relationship  she slowly got her rights  oh damn  he's trying  he lost it  but he didn't catch  that she was getting her rights  when they  just one day  he woke up 
[04:34:00]  and she had rights  oh my god  she's got rights  i just waited for you  i waited and waited  till i fell asleep  and then  waited and waited  like two and a half  fucking minutes  you're fucking snoring  don't you dare wake  you're blaming me  right now  now i'm blaming you  you went to sleep  i don't blame you  i deserve to be blown  very  before the  fucking jacuzzi  the greatest thing ever said  by a man 
[04:34:30]  right there  i deserve to be blown  first  before  i challenge you  that is the greatest thing ever said by a man  when you think of the problems in the world  there literally are kids  who have flies crawling on their mouths  and then  like if aliens came here  and they just looked at all human problems  and they went from someone with a fly on their mouth  and then just fucking panned over to mel  i deserve to be blown before the jacuzzi  before the jacuzzi  is this greater than one step for  oh my god 
[04:35:00]  one small step for man  one giant  of course  that line is right up there  right up there  yeah  ick benign  how can this be fake  if this is a fake thing  it has to be put up for some kind of oscar  because there's no one says that  no one says that in an improv  this has to be put in a time capsule  he would be  for other generations  if this was fake  he would be sequestered somewhere right now  going  i can't believe they're still fucking believing this  when i said 
[04:35:30]  blow me before the jacuzzi  like that line  if i had said that as a joke  and people believed it  i'd be i'd be amazed  amazed that people would believe that  a human would say something  that silly  didn't he say too  you could hear she talks over  because she's very rude  interrupting this amazing tirade  yes  oh boy jimmy  doesn't he say like  that one part  we hear that again  we went backwards  didn't she go like  you blew me  he goes you blew me  you fell asleep 
[04:36:00]  without blowing me  he says it again  before he says you deserve  yeah  the first time he says it  let me go way back then  no it's like a second before  oh it is  let's pick it up here  what is she  the part  that's the thing  she said  the thing where  she goes  oh my god  he  fuck it  play it  because there's something she says  and i still don't get  because he was  I don't get it  part of it is this  i think she fell asleep 
[04:36:30]  before they fucked her out  yes  Mel is one of these guys  he's really feeling like  he feels sexually rejected  and it's like  i used to do that  in relationships  where if i didn't get  what i wanted sexually  i would brood  and i would brood  and then the next day  everything she goes  how you doing  fine  and i would wait  for her to know  that she didn't do  what i wanted her  to do sexually  i was really hurt  and selfish  but i was angry  and it was like  she would do something else  like uh  you know  not get me the right  kind of sandwich  i'd be like  what the fuck 
[04:37:00]  that's not what i asked for  all coming from this night before  and that's where  that rage  what was the two minute thing  you were sleeping  two minutes  he apparently had to  do something  so he left the room  he was excited  to go into the bedroom  and get a little action  he said two and a half  asleep in two minutes  in two minutes  he came back  she goes  well you left  for a while  and he goes  a while  it was two and a half minutes  he comes back  and she's snoring  he said something like  snoring  we are slowly uncovering  this day  yes  again i think 
[04:37:30]  she changed the contract  she  yes  she  fucking  in that  she starts  starting to treat him  like a  old  man  with dry hair  with dry hair  and that  and that's  and he  and that's  her job was not  to treat him like that  her job was  her job was to  fucking  make him feel  like  and there's one of the tapes  where he goes  i want a woman  a woman  that make me feel 
[04:38:00]  like a man  yeah  and he has no soulmate  but because he  because he's a  fucking billionaire  sociopath  who now  dick doesn't get  raging hard  he doesn't get  road warrior hard  no more  road warrior  and  and he needs a girl  that accepts  that his dick  is a little bendy  dick needs that brace  like a road warrior  on his leg  he needs love  he needs somebody 
[04:38:30]  that loves  his dry hair  but he's all  he's also  here's where he  fucked up  and changed the  contract  she is expecting  mel gibson to be  mel gibson  and go it's time  for some fucking  stupid  instead every time  she rejects him  he's like  come on  she wasn't ready  for all  come on  she's like  oh no  he's like  every guy  got fucked  he's like  she owns him  he should own her  but he doesn't  she owns him sexually  and he rejects it  women want you to talk  women want you to talk 
[04:39:00]  the relationship  from suicide  they  like  they  they're willing to take  but they want  I'm telling you man  my girl finds this to be  she wants to get me  to that point  because it seems like  it means something  but it's like  they do that  they  like they fucking do that  anytime  like I have  my girl  now she talks  right  she talks a lot  and she repeats things  50 times  because she's like  I'm talking  and there's nothing  anybody can do about it  and I go  and I gotta go 
[04:39:30]  I gotta go bitch  listen man  you gotta shut up  and then she goes  see  and I go look  the only thing I can do  is leave  because I'm not gonna  try to convince you  I'm telling you  you're trying to be abusive  you're trying to move  into a position  that ain't gonna allow  our relationship  to exist  you  being better than me  you can't live like that  women can't live  with a guy  that's not better than them  so when she tries  to start talking  and here's what happened  and then I go 
[04:40:00]  and she goes  let me finish  I go okay  so I see where you're going  cunt  you're spreading your wings  you think you're fucking  you think you're fucking  prince  of Zamunda hoe  like you think  now you explore with me  explore by yourself  you fucking creep  and explore this  this new world  without me  you're not gonna explore  on me  that's what she did  to Mel  she explored  and he flinched  she went like this  with the pretending  to hit him  and he went oh 
[04:40:30]  and she said  oh this scared  motherfucker  you can't flinch  with these bitches  you have to  mentally abuse them  they won't settle  for less  what a great  great  the way they talk about  is the power shift  in the relationship  where the dominant person  then becomes the submissive person  and then the whole rest  of the relationship  you're fighting  to get your old job back  you ain't getting it back  you flinch  good way to put it  get out of there  leave  great way to put it  great way to put it  let's go back to the tape 
[04:41:00]  I don't blame you  how dare you  how fucking dare you 
[04:41:30]  how dare her  how  then he punctuates it  with a  all she has to do  is suck his dick  and he'd be nice Mel again  how dare she  can you get this equipment  from Radio Shack  by the way  I don't know  what is this  what's going on  like how is she doing  it's a really good recording  right  phone recorder  yeah she fucking  set this up in advance  she must have it  nicely for herself  this is tremendous  she obviously has somebody  help her out 
[04:42:00]  hell fucking yes  this dummy  she wouldn't be able  to figure this out  on her own  she's just giggling at us  how amazing  is it to yell at somebody  and be serious  like that's how  Mel Gibson-y he is  to go  you fell asleep  without blowing me  like I would think that  but never actually  say it to her  I'll burn the fucking  house down  blow me  I deserve to be blown  before the fucking  jacuzzi  he says how dare you  he's so mad  he's so  how dare you  purely insulting 
[04:42:30]  his mother  like how dare  like how dare you  not blow me  that's  when God invented  emotions  it's like  he's as close  to godly man  have you ever been  that fucking  yes  yes  really  oh yeah  I can't  and expressed it  yes  for real  but that goes  I hate to say  the detainee  rageaholic  but that's where  rage is just  fueling itself  and it's not about  the argument anymore  it's about anger  making you angrier 
[04:43:00]  it's about the anger  as opposed to  it's the high of being angry  as opposed to the issue  the maddest  I've ever been  with my woman  now  we went to get her  she needed a new car  a new something  to drive  it was the choice  of  the money was  a brand new  car  these cheaper cars  yeah  brand new  or an old  truck  she wanted  badly  a truck  but she kept 
[04:43:30]  saying to me  um  what should I do  I said  I think you should  use this money  to get a brand new  car  but I want a truck  but what do you think  she did that  75 times  until my head  got so  filled up with blood  of mad  at what she was doing  and I said  what the fuck  is wrong with you  and we talked about it  yesterday  because this Mel Gibson  shit opens up  that shit  she thinks 
[04:44:00]  in her head  that she wasn't  doing some  manipulative  little pussy ass  shit  to get her way  so she doesn't  understand  my fury  because she's  because women  get to have  an excuse  for everything  they don't have  to have  their own  shit  they're not  taught to go  you know what  I fucked up  I did that  I never heard  a girl go  I fucked up  I really  that was some 
[04:44:30]  stupid  some probably do  but  they have  an excuse  this girl  did something  to Mel  man  I'm telling you  for him  to lose  it like that  it's because  she's just  a game player  dude I've been  so angry before  I've actually  had to say  to women  and I've never  hit a woman  in my life  but there's  been times  where I could  I visualize  what their  teeth would look  like falling  out  and I have  for real  had to say  and this is  that a woman  who's screaming  at me  like you know  what I mean  it doesn't  really  I've had it  a couple times  in my life  where I've  actually had  to scream 
[04:45:00]  you have to  shut  you have to  stop talking  like almost  like breaking  the code  of the argument  going  you really  have to  stop talking  and I'm not  threatening  I never say  I'm going to  hit you  but they  understand  oh  this is like  this is going  to an awful  place  and I'm not  saying I'm  threatening them  but I think  they understand  it's like  my anger  is fueling  my anger  and how can you  hate mental  abuse if you're  a woman  when my next  recourse  is to put my  fist through  your fucking  head  like why  are you doing  this  like that's  my next  thing  like so 
[04:45:30]  how can you  not  let me tell  you something  I bet you  OJ's listening  to this  going  come on  Mel  do it  you know  you want  to do it  that's how  OJ was feeling  right before  heads was flying  justify what I  did  unrecorded  phone calls  of OJ  that sounded  probably very  similar  you fucked  a waiter  you fuck it  he's in my  fucking car  bitch  he's juicing  me correctly  I'll cut you  fucking hell  absolutely 
[04:46:00]  sounded like  macho man  it's like  bitch  can get you  to sound like  macho man  boy  it's fucking  OJ  guns  do you hear  how he's  hanging on to  his dominance  though  he keeps  going  it's over  it's like  by saying that  he's trying to  have her go  no I don't  want it to be  over  it's like  you've already  lost your  number one  position  your number  two  and if  it's over  just fucking  hang up  it's done  great movie  quote is  war games  it's like  when you  do that  it can't 
[04:46:30]  be  because look  if I say  to my girl  sweet I think  we gotta  wrap this up  it can't be  some trick  to get her  to go  no  it has  to be  a rational  like  in war games  it was like  the only  winning move  is not  to play  and it's like  I'm not  trying to play  with your  emotions  I know  I can be  you know  a lot of  times guys  are just  possessive  man  and they  possess  we have  to be  rational  and he  is in a  bad spot  because she  used to  fear him  she used  to fear  his rage  his money 
[04:47:00]  now he's  scrambling  and you can't  do that  you cannot  do that  but you have  to make  them understand  that the best  thing is that  they stay  mentally where  they was  when they  liked you  or it's  gonna end  up this  yeah but  that ain't  gonna happen  yeah  the true  lesson to  learn from  war games  is  just unplug  the goddamn  thing  unplug that 
[04:47:30]  thing  let's get  back to the  tape  let's get  back to the  tape  because we  got some  remixes to  play that  people are  going to  really enjoy  you need  meditation  okay 
[04:48:00]  and you  know you're  doing it  and you're  a liar  and you're  dishonest  and you're  fucked up  so you stay  the fuck  away from  me  take care of  your fucking  son  and I  better have  my daughter  I just  want my  daughter  and a maid  it's a  last life  fucking  trouble  he's like  Steve Martin  at the end  of the jerk  I want my  daughter  and a maid  and this  paper clip 
[04:48:30]  daughter  and a maid  it's a  last life  fucking  trouble  they clean  up after  themselves  they make  your goddamn  bed  which you  did not  you're not  to worry  about emotional  blackmail  or any  other bullshit  that you  put me  through  I just  need a  nice woman  to look  after my  beautiful  daughter  I don't  get the  fuck  or anything  you're a  pain in the  ass  you're a 
[04:49:00]  pain in  my  ass  stop  being  that  you're a  pain in  my  ass  nothing  and that's  where that  tape ends  if that's  not the  greatest  cliffhanger  yeah  since  fucking  the  empire  strikes  back  tape  number  five  comes out  in 45  minutes  and we'll  add it  and she  hangs up  on a long  time  because the  beginning of  the other  tape  he starts  off 
[04:49:30]  don't you  fucking  hang up  on  right  right  yeah  she's not  now because  she's recording  right so she's  just fucking  you think he's  on to it  now  what is he  maybe he's  drunk or high  yeah  maybe he's  listening to it  with complete  embarrassment  maybe she's  not recording  these were all  made before  these conversations  already happened  he's not just  continually calling  her  these are done  no no I mean  now what is  what is  oh literal  what is he  feeling now  what is he  feeling now  I'm embarrassed 
[04:50:00]  oh literal  Jim  like he'd  still be calling  all the tapes  are out  and he's still  calling  I'm embarrassed  shut up  okay  fuck it  what's next  he's probably  sitting there  going oh god  I hope  I hope she  didn't record  that other  thing  that's what  he's thinking  there's one  he has no  idea  he has no 
[04:50:30]  idea which  ones were  recorded  it sounds  like they  had a lot  of these  conversations  and she  probably  finally  fucking  hadn't  started  taping  them  he's  probably  praying  oh god  please  don't  have  the  fuck  Haiti  call  recorded  oh  please  don't  have  the  fuck  Haiti  call  yeah  that's  what I'm  saying  he can't  handle  a 7.0  those  weak  foreign  niggas  how weird  is it that  he needs  the bed  maids  how many  guys need  their bed  maids  he probably  has a  daily  fucking  maids  but he  wants her  to do  that 
[04:51:00]  what is  radar  online  is this  thing  big  it's  the guy  from  MASH  waiting  for  something  oh  shit  you  want  jimmy's  line  again  i  want  jimmy's  line  again  oh  yeah  can we  hear  it  travis  he starts  off  don't  you  fucking  hang up  all right  right  yeah  she's  not  now  because  she's  recording  so  right  so  she's  just  fucking  you  think  he's  onto  it  now  what 
[04:51:30]  is  he  maybe  he's  drunk  or high  yeah  maybe  he's  listening  to  it  with  complete  embarrassment  these  were all  made  before  these  conversations  already  happened  he's  not  just  continually  calling  her  he's  done  now  what  is  he  feeling  now  wow  jimmy  listening  back to  that  when  patrice  was  saying  she's  drunk  he's  drunk  or  high  i  thought  that  he  meant  i  misunderstood  him  so i  thought 
[04:52:00]  he  thought  that  like  that  call  was  just  made  i  thought  you  said  that  and then  he's  still  calling  what  you  got  me  in  the  pain  on  mindless  kid  and i  thought  you said  the calls  were made  already  i'm an  asshole  i'm a  fucking  cunt  how's  mel dylan  maybe he's  he's a  complete  he's just  such a  powerful  guy  he'll  just  go  you know  what  yeah  he's  got  plenty  of  money  makes  his  own  movies  he  don't  care  now  what  did  we  ask  for  from  entenemans  um  that  that was  it  the  chocolate  chip  crumb  cake  entenemans  just  crumb  cake
