<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a chaotic, expletive-filled exchange targeting various sports teams and even Hanukkah.  The hosts then transition into a discussion about the commercialization of Christmas, contrasting it with its religious roots and mentioning Norse Yule traditions.  The bulk of the early segment focuses on Anthony’s car breakdown in a crowded mall parking lot. His attempts to jumpstart it, involving a failed interaction with mall security and Kenny's unsuccessful attempts to borrow jumper cables, lead to Anthony spending Saturday night with Kenny and his family.  This segues into a detailed, comedic description of Kenny's ritualistic pasta-eating habits.

Comedian Rich Voss then joins the show. The conversation initially revolves around Voss’s marital difficulties, including fights with his wife over parenting and social events. The hosts provide unsolicited and crude relationship advice.  Voss's car troubles (a burnt-out windshield wiper motor) and an unsatisfactory wedding gift are also discussed, along with upcoming show dates at the Borgata and an update on the "tree man" story.

The discussion with Voss continues into a segment focusing on his dilemma of whether to travel to Edmonton, Canada, to see his wife and child for Christmas, balancing work commitments against family time.  The hosts relentlessly tease him, suggesting absurd solutions. A significant portion delves into a Continental Airlines plane crash in Denver, with graphic and misogynistic commentary on a passenger. Other topics include Voss's New Year's Eve gig, the instability of banks, venue renaming, a "Name That Celebrity" game where Voss struggles, listener voicemails from the "FU Line" containing vulgar messages, updates on "Tree Man," and offensive remarks about the New York governor's visit to Iraq.  Nick DiPaolo joins the broadcast, expressing frustration over delays.  The hosts and guests engage in further banter and offensive jokes.

A later segment centers on Voss's unusual Christmas arrangement with his ex-wife and her new husband.  The hosts and guests humorously and crudely discuss this situation, speculating on the dynamics involved.  This segment also includes discussions about Voss's new rabbit fur coat (which is later thrown away), more celebrity name games, the show's recent trouble with management (potentially related to "insertion bits"), and the challenges of explaining the show's style to those unfamiliar with it.  Opie, Anthony, Voss, and DiPaolo (who mentions his show and new CD) are all present, with highly profane language and discussions of sexual acts and animal cruelty.

A subsequent segment focuses on the hosts’ strained relationship with SiriusXM management, specifically concerning three months of unpaid salaries and pressure to conform to a specific on-air style (compared to Eric Logan).  They express frustration about a required conference call to address these issues.  This is interspersed with crude and sexually explicit commentary about several female news personalities.  The segment includes a review of "Bombs and Flubs" from Voss's appearances, featuring audio clips and the running gag about his fur coat.  A phone call from Jim Norton reveals his desire for a break, compares his experience to the Cold War, mentions his lack of a direct hotline, and discusses a strained relationship with Patrice O'Neal, touching upon racial commentary and a past on-air conflict.

The final segment covers a prior argument with Patrice O'Neal,  upcoming appearances at comedy clubs (Stress Factory and a new club opening January 15th),  the upcoming move to smaller Sirius XM studios (near "the gay station" and Martha Stewart), and frequent interruptions, inappropriate jokes, and offensive language.  A back-and-forth with the seemingly absent Voss leads to him leaving the studio.  The hosts jokingly threaten violence and make crude comments about Martha Stewart, Julia Child, and others.  They discuss planned show segments involving food and potentially offensive stunts, and end with plugs for DiPaolo's shows and CD.  The overall tone remains chaotic and irreverent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh my god, no!  Oops! Oops!  Oh my god, dude!  Is that a pickle jar?  Smell the muscle, man.  He gasped.  Goodbye!  Oh, oh, there goes the headphones.  Goodbye!  Wow, you're getting the slow clap. 
[00:00:30]  I'll think about it if I want to come back.  Oh, there goes the headphones.  Jimmy, put your goddamn shirt on, Patty.  You'll look like ****.  I know.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  F the Jets.  F Big Blue.  F this effing weather.  F the Denver Airport.  F you.  F you.  F you.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Happy holidays.  Happy Hanukkah, right?  Didn't Hanukkah start or something?  Hanukkah starts.  Yeah.  And F Hanukkah.  David paid tribute by not giving me a knife or a napkin with my breakfast.  There you go.  They're bitching in the paper today.  I thought it was economical.  They're bitching in the paper today because there's not enough Hanukkah Christmas shows.  What?  What?  They're going to start now?  Do you remember one Hanukkah?  I said Hanukkah Christmas show. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Hanukkah Christmas show.  Well, that's how we think.  Yeah.  It's Christmas.  Christmas.  It seems like other religions jumped on to our party.  I think that whole thing's kind of simmering down finally.  You know, everybody just want to kind of edge in on Christmas.  Yeah.  Christmas is emerging victorious after a few years of political correctness.  When now people are really saying Merry Christmas and a happy holiday.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  And everyone isn't trying to shove their stupid Christmas tradition that might only be 10 years old into our faces if we're celebrating Christmas.  When I was running around this weekend trying to get all my Christmas shopping done, the last thing I was thinking about was the baby Jesus.  The baby Jesus.  See, if we just take the religion thing out of it, then people could understand.  We could all just say Merry Christmas.  Yeah.  This has nothing to do with religion anymore.  Oh, there's a small percentage of you do-gooders out there that will go to midnight mass. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  But the rest of us, we don't acknowledge this as a religious thing anymore.  I was watching the History of Christmas on the History Channel.  And what they did was we have a lot of our Christmas tradition, not so much from religion and the Bible, which is, you know, Jesus' birthday, blah, blah, blah.  But the Norse, the Norseman, with the Yule log, what they would do is they'd burn a big log. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And that was the Yule log.  And every spark that came off the log represented a pig or a cow that they would have sex with.  No, no, that they would have next season.  Uh-huh.  You know, it was supposed to be good tidings.  And then they would bring in, into their house, pine trees because they represented strength through the cold winter months because they were the only trees that, you know, kind of stayed the same throughout winter. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Evergreens, things like that.  Love it.  So they'd bring it in the house to represent that, and they would all celebrate together outside of the crappy weather that they would have by going over each other's house, keeping warm, and celebrating like that.  That's where we got our traditional Christmas stuff from.  Not the Bible.  That sounds like fun.  That sounds like fun.  You keep it, you know, non-secular.  Oh, yeah, FD Eagles as well, yes.  Big game there.  Whatever. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  What did you say just before the mics went on?  Because that's our new slogan.  I love it.  Oh, God.  Wait a minute.  I was saying a lot.  I was saying a lot before the mics went on.  As a matter of fact, on PalTalk, people were like, uh-oh, Anthony looks revved up.  Oh, we're all revved up.  Nothing has changed, trust me.  We're finishing out the year.  Well, you said, uh, uh, well, I, you know, I'm in the most trouble, so I'll just shut up.  If you want to join the trouble, uh.  I was trying to remember, um, this. 
[00:04:30]  Because I did say quite a few things.  Yeah.  Was it right before the mics went on?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, right, jotting it down.  You got to jot it down.  I don't speak well, but I certainly, certainly write well.  But I can't, I can't figure out how to spell this word this morning.  Okay, so if it's misspelled, your new slogan, we want sweepers and everything.  F the management.  F management, we rule.  Yeah, we rule.  It's been like that for 14 plus years.  14 years.  Get used to it. 
[00:05:00]  Get it.  Yeah, get our show, and then we can start from there.  Live it.  Learn it.  Know it.  Ah, I'm in a, uh, a bad mood.  My car broke down.  What?  I had to spend Saturday night with the Kenny family.  What?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Dude, I pushed it, and I pushed it, and I pushed it.  Everyone knows I need a new car.  And, uh, you know, I told the story last time that, you know, the heat only works on the driver's side. 
[00:05:30]  Hey, is that car, the one you have, is that the same one we used to commute in?  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, I have been through four, five cars or something in that time.  Yeah.  I just, I just insist on being a regular guy.  Wow.  So I can relate to the audience.  Regular guys buy newer cars.  I know.  I just want to be able to relate.  By breaking down and pushing, uh, your car in the snow? 
[00:06:00]  What happened?  I refuse to go Hollywood, man.  Man.  Uh, I was at the, uh, the Short Hills Mall.  Ah.  Home of one of the homeless shopping sprees.  Yes.  Remember that bit we used to be able to do?  Fantastic bit.  We were almost going to do the homeless shopping spree this year, but, but the dummies, uh,  told us that, uh, we needed to get permission from the mall.  They said, good news.  We could do the homeless shopping spree.  Yeah.  Well, we need you guys to get permission from the mall before we do it. 
[00:06:30]  Permission from the mall wouldn't even be that bad because I do believe we went to the  Short Hills Mall whenever we did this and did get permission.  We said we're going to be coming in and, uh.  You don't ask ahead of time.  That's the key.  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of, you kind of tell them.  You, you tell them.  You tell them.  We are taking over your mall with a bunch of smelly homeless dudes.  Yes.  And about 5,000 listeners easily.  They wanted the mall to actually consent to something, uh, as if, let me give you a scenario. 
[00:07:00]  Um, 5,000 of our fans run through the place, ransacking everything and doing the, um, the  Stalin's scorched earth policy.  Right.  Uh, burning the place to the ground.  Right.  And then we'd be able to go as a company.  Well, sorry.  It's on you.  See, the mall would then have to agree to that.  Yeah.  And then they'd go, what's in it for us?  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Nothing.  The, the suits.  We'll just call them the suits.  Yeah.  And then the suits will get mad at us and then we'll have to come up with another term.  But the suits actually came to us and said, good news.  You guys will be able to do it as long as we get the permission from the mall.  I rolled my eyes.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  Why don't you just tell us we're not doing the homeless shopping spree?  Once the word indemnification comes in.  Right.  Once I hear indemnify.  Right.  I know things are over.  Right.  Maybe we can get the mall to pay us extra too and provide transportation.  Yeah.  Can we do that?  I rolled my eyes. 
[00:08:00]  I'm like, that's not good news.  That's a no.  That's just like a no that's going to happen.  Not today, but a week from now.  That's a delayed no you just gave me.  Good news, we can do the homeless shopping spree if you can pretend to be homeless and build  a mall.  Yeah.  Build a facade that looks like a mall.  The way it was presented, they'd rather have the mall look like Dawn of the Dead than the  O.P. and Anthony show.  You don't ask permission to do homeless shopping spree.  No.  And our track record speaks for itself. 
[00:08:30]  We've had what, four?  I think four homeless shopping sprees without a problem, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh, it gets a little crazy, a little edgy, a little outrageous.  Look out.  Now, one problem in four years, and the mall ends up making a lot of money, and this year,  with how bad it is out there with sales, it would have been a nice little bump up for  one of these malls.  So anyway, back to my car.  What's wrong?  No, just like, I'm just reading.  Okay.  Back to my car.  So the last, I left off this saga, you know, the car's six, I think, wait, no, we, wow, 
[00:09:00]  I bought it just before 9-11.  I bought it, like, two to three months before 9-11.  Wow.  All right.  Seven years old.  And it's gotten to the point where the heat works nice for the driver, and my lovely, so  weird to say, but my lovely wife freezes her you-know-what's off because there's no heat  on her side, which wasn't a problem until one day I was really tired, and she had to 
[00:09:30]  drive, and I realized how cold the passenger seat really is.  And it put the thought in my head, wow, I've got to get a new car.  And I think we talked about this about a month ago.  You would think between then and today I would have got the new car.  Get the car.  This weekend it was time to do some Christmas shopping, went to the Short Hills Mall, running  around the mall, having a good time, getting presents, blah, blah, blah.  And then we go out to the garage, and I have to meet my brother and his kids and his wife  for a little din-din, a little pre-Christmas din-din, and we're all excited. 
[00:10:00]  It's going to be fun.  Haven't seen them in a while.  Put the key in, and click, click.  Click, click.  Oh, you got the click?  Click, click.  Click, click.  Nothing like that.  No.  Click, click.  Click, click.  Oh, boy.  Which is, when your car breaks down, I got to tell you, the best place for it to break  down is in a four-level parking garage in the middle of the Christmas buying season.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  You know, that same parking lot that most of you guys out there were in this weekend, where 
[00:10:30]  it took, what, an hour just to get into the parking lot?  You know, that's a perfect place to break down.  Click, click.  Click, click.  Click, click.  Look up, and one of those dome lights were on.  I'm like, you got to be kidding me.  Oh.  And I think when they got my car in the garage, they had that light on.  I didn't notice, because it was daylight when I drove out.  Yeah.  And it drained the battery.  I don't know, Ralph.  Maybe that battery?  Yeah.  Don't be too sure, Ralph.  I ain't got no hairpin. 
[00:11:00]  Are you nice to the people in the garage?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Always be nice to them, because they'll leave your car lights on sometimes.  It's a way they can screw you.  Yep.  Oh, no.  I'm good, man.  Believe it or not, I'm good.  I take care of those guys big time.  So then call Mall Security and Club Serta Kenny at the same time, because it turns out Kenny  lives a mere 10 to 15 minutes from that mall, something like that.  So Mall Security comes with one of those portable jumper cable things.  They tried to help me for maybe a total of 30 seconds. 
[00:11:30]  So I really thank them for the effort they made.  They did a quick little jump.  I turned the key.  Click, click.  Click, click.  Nothing.  Okay, goodbye.  The guy actually couldn't say it has to be your starter as he's slamming his car door  and taking off.  Not giving me a chance to go, no, it's not my starter.  I'm not one of these gearheads, but I know a little something about cars.  I know it was a dead battery.  Kenny comes.  No jumper cables.  So now the people coming from above, you know how you circle around? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, no.  Kenny is, like, basically standing in the middle of traffic.  Commandeering a vehicle like that stands.  He might as well have.  He's just...  I need your car.  G8 has to get home.  Get out.  He's just standing there going, jumper cables to every single...  Hundreds of cars.  What did they think?  Jumper cables.  He wanted to hook them up to the bolts on his neck?  Right.  Not, I need jumper cables.  Jumper cables, like, leaning into every car window. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And they're horrified.  You see people actually, like, locking their doors.  Finally, some...  He's a ghoul.  Finally, some dude, I think he's a fan of the show.  He stops, gives us jumper cables.  The lady just happens to be pulling out in the spot in front of my car, which is a miracle.  Kenny pulls his in...  No, we tried...  Whatever.  I'm making this way too long.  Whatever.  But we hooked up the jumper cables, and the lady was impatient.  She needed to leave.  She's on a cell phone, making a phone call to some, like, ridiculous foreign land. 
[00:13:00]  She goes, this is the only time I could talk to my family back home.  And then we're trying to, like, jumpstart the car.  But, you know, the battery's so dead, it's going to take a while.  But she didn't have time.  So we gave it, like, another 30 seconds.  She goes, well, I really got to go.  I mean, you know, I'm like, all right, leave.  We should have bought the jumper cables for her.  She said, look, why don't you have these tomorrow?  We'll give you $10,000 for them.  So, making a long story short, I was stuck.  No dinner with my brother and the kids.  Kenny drives me back to his house. 
[00:13:30]  Next thing you know, I'm spending a Saturday night with Kenny and his family.  Wait, wait, wait.  So he drove you to his house?  You left the truck there?  Just for dinner and all that, yeah.  Oh, you didn't stay over there?  Oh, hell no.  Oh, hell no.  Hell no.  I wouldn't do that.  Hell no.  So then I jumped on a train and got home.  And then Kenny calls me this morning, yesterday morning, Sunday.  He goes, you're not going to believe this.  I went to the garage and I said, what the hell?  I'll just see if it starts.  And it started. 
[00:14:00]  I go, yeah.  Because it was the battery the whole time.  I still need a new car, granted.  Yeah.  But I knew the whole time it was the battery.  We just need a little more time in the parking lot to get some juice in this battery.  You're a celebrity.  You're a celebrity.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's December.  Your wife shouldn't have freezing ankles.  Buy a new car.  You're very famous.  I think we've got a couple weeks off.  So if I don't have a car by the time I get back, then, you know.  Dude, lease one.  I don't know what to tell you.  No, I'm buying. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  I'd buy, I'd beat the crap out of these vehicles, and I'd pass them on to somebody that's deserving  in my family.  Just abandon them in a parking garage.  Yeah, let them have the problems.  Parking garage.  Let them have the problems with the car.  Wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That car just started?  Yeah.  And I knew it would.  Wait, wait, wait.  It had a sit.  It had a sit.  Dude, then it couldn't have been the battery.  Right.  No.  Something then, like, defrosted. 
[00:15:00]  We'll find out today.  I think it had a sticky solenoid.  Oh, my God.  It could have been a sticky solenoid that finally maybe thawed out a little bit.  Yeah.  And, you know, it was able to engage the starter.  Why didn't the headlights go on, then?  Headlights didn't go on at all?  Nope.  Interesting.  Yep.  Could have been a battery, though.  It could have been the connection.  I don't know.  Perhaps there was some buildup between the terminal. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  I know that.  I mean, I know a little bit about cars.  I'm not a complete dummy.  I don't want to argue with Anthony over cars, but I have to destroy the sticky solenoids.  I used to have a sticky solenoid.  I've had it many occasions, but that's not the problem here, because they had just driven.  So the engine would have been hotter when he first started to try it than the entire day and a half later,  where it was even colder at night.  Are you sure we're allowed to talk about sticky solenoids?  Sticky solenoid.  Hey. 
[00:16:00]  That could be a little too much, you know.  Sexy.  Can we check with people before we talk about sticky solenoids?  All right.  The verdict is coming in.  Gremlins.  Gremlins?  Gremlins.  I like that.  People are saying you had gremlins.  I like that.  So, you know, for the haters out there, I'm sure they're very happy that I was stuck in the middle of nowhere having dinner with Kenny and his family.  Big three is suggesting you change your turn signal fluid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have you guys ever had dinner with Kenny? 
[00:16:30]  Like, we've had dinner at restaurants where you have to eat what they bring you.  Wow, did I learn a few things about Kenny on Saturday night.  What?  Oh, really?  Wow.  Well, I have to talk about it after the break because we're later ready.  All right.  Because of my car babble.  But, wow.  And I was trying to mess with how he eats and his wife was like, no, no, no, no, you get to leave.  She's like, you get to leave and go back to New York.  Do not, do not do that. 
[00:17:00]  Really?  I thought it would be fun to mess with him.  Oh, he has to count stuff.  No, he doesn't.  He has to count stuff when he eats.  When he eats?  When he eats.  The dinner was lovely.  Kenny's wife cooked a nice meal for us and they couldn't have been nicer.  But Kenny is insane.  He's crazy.  He is nuts.  And he lost power last night because we got some, boy, do we got some winds whipping through New York today.  And it knocked out Kenny's lights for about five minutes. 
[00:17:30]  Kenny said he had to get up at 1 a.m. to reset every clock in the house.  Why can't you wait?  He is nuts.  He is nuts.  What does he count?  Does he just go one?  And you're like, what is that?  My friends.  And I also found out that Kenny has a 13-year-old nephew that's 6'5".  Really?  You know how we joke about those, you know.  I'm a regular kid. 
[00:18:00]  He has a 13-year-old nephew that's 6'5".  Playing basketball?  6'5".  He's too young to play basketball.  6'5 at 13.  Wow.  So, I'll explain the Kenny eating thing after the break.  And we'll talk football.  I want to thank Jimmy for turning us on to Continental.  That was great, Jimmy.  Yes.  It's the only airline.  Oh, my God.  I fly them almost exclusively, not quite.  And you got us all pretty much flying them exclusively. 
[00:18:30]  But they had a little problem in Denver.  Was there a flight late?  And Jimmy just found out about this problem in Denver as he sat down.  So, we'll talk about that.  Well, you know what happened is I was on a Denver flight and I was in coach and they upgraded me to ditch.  There you go.  You know, I was almost on that plane.  I mean, I've never been to Denver as usual, but I was almost on that plane. 
[00:19:00]  Because in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, you know, this is the time of year to go skiing out west.  And why not go to Denver and do a little skiing?  Yeah, dude, I'm dying to go to a Broncos game.  How many times have I said that?  I know.  Yeah.  Could have been on there.  You know, it's a little creepy when you think, though.  Like, you may have been on that plane.  It's a Continental 737.  Oh, yeah.  I was on that plane.  You might have been on that plane.  No, that actual plane.  Yes.  I thought that stuff before.  The one.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen.  By the way, I hate to tell you this, but I told you so. 
[00:19:30]  To all the Jets fans out there, I told you so.  This Brett Favre is a bust.  It's out of their hands.  Just when we need him, too.  I told you so.  Lots to do.  Stay there, Opie and Anthony.  Way to go, Jets.  Way to go.  Morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I told you this Brett Favre would let us down in the end.  The Jets lose to the Seahawks yesterday.  They were 8-3. 
[00:20:00]  Now, what are we?  9-6?  It doesn't matter what you are.  We've only won one out of the last four.  Brett Favre, because I've been keeping track.  Brett Favre.  In the last four games, guess how many touchdowns Brett Favre has thrown for in the last four  games, Anthony.  All right.  I'll say four.  How about Uno?  That's Spanish for one.  One touchdown in four games.  Six interceptions. 
[00:20:30]  Yikes.  So now it comes down to the Jets have to play Miami in Miami.  And Chad Pennington wants to beat the Jets so bad it's not even funny.  They have to beat Miami, and then we've got to hope, like...  And then the Pats got to lose.  I think so, yeah.  Yeah, you've got to do that stupid math thing.  So it's out of their hands.  It gets to the point where it's out of their hands.  Pats or Baltimore loses, but they just have to win now.  They were in the driver's seat.  Yep.  I'm having a Jet fan. 
[00:21:00]  That annoys me four Jet fans.  Yeah.  It's just like a little...  That last throw at the end of the game yesterday, too.  Wow.  That was it right there.  That was the whole game.  I thought Coles had it.  I thought he had it.  That was the game right there.  But then again, it's a slippery football.  It's snowing.  It's a little of everything going on there.  Yeah, they make the big bucks, as they say.  The big bucks.  You're supposed to make those big plays.  I understand.  But, man, I love watching those football games when it's snowing like that.  I love it.  It's pretty cool.  You know, I hope they stop making the dome stadiums because, I mean, getting to see football. 
[00:21:30]  But it's not fair because you worked the whole year, and now it's coming down to this game in Seattle,  and it's like almost a blizzard.  The weather comes into play.  It has nothing to do with how you practiced all year.  Now you've got to remember being eight or nine years old going, well, how did me and  my buddies do this?  That's true.  You can't, like, practice in the snow.  No.  Why would you?  Yeah.  It's got to be in your DNA, like, when you were growing up.  So your Cowboys lost their last game.  They stink this time of year. 
[00:22:00]  I forget what their record in the last few years, like, for these months are, like the  last four games of the year.  It's abysmal.  Yeah.  Of course they lost.  Two out of the last three.  Why wouldn't they?  It was the last game at Texas Stadium.  Good.  They say Jerry Jones picked the Ravens.  He hand-picked the Ravens because he thought they'd be an easy win.  You dummy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There's a story now saying he petitioned the league for it to be the Ravens.  To be an easy game?  What a dummy.  I mean, he probably didn't say that.  He should ask for the Lions, who are now 0-15, my friend.  That's an amazing record. 
[00:22:30]  And that has never been done before.  There was a team, I think it was Tampa Bay.  Yeah.  Because somebody yelled at us for not knowing our knowledge, because somebody, yeah, Tampa  Bay Buccaneers went 0-14 when it was a 14-game season.  This is the first time anyone's gone 0-15.  And you know they're going to blow it and win the last game to mess it up for us.  Yeah.  Ruin the whole thing where we could have fun going, ah, ha.  Yeah.  Like, how embarrassing is it for the team that does lose to them?  It's like, jeez, you went all season.  You didn't win one game.  Yeah.  And then, ah, you lost to them. 
[00:23:00]  Oopsie.  And then the big blue won again, and now they're the top playoff seed in the NFC.  Pretty blue.  Congrats to the big blue fans.  I am not one of you.  I'm not either.  But at least they won when they had to, as opposed to, ah.  Yeah, you got to give them that.  You know, stupid Dallas.  Got to give them credit for that one.  There you go.  Uh, where's Kenny?  I want to talk about his eating thing.  Keeney.  Uh, Robin in Detroit.  In the D?  It's got to be cold in the D, Robin.  My God, how cold is it in the D?  Uh, well, yesterday was like Siberia. 
[00:23:30]  I think we got the wind that you guys were getting.  There's just snow and just accidents.  I'm sitting here stopping the expressway.  The accidents.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's accidents when it's a wintry mess.  Yes.  Yeah, you'd think we lived in Florida or something.  I don't know.  The accidents.  I want to get a shout-out.  I want to get a shout-out to our Lions.  One more crappy thing about this town.  Yeah, you guys are going to go 0-16.  But now that I said you're going 0-16, you know you're winning the last game, right?  No, we're rooting to lose because if we can't win and get a record, we'll be known for being the suckiest team, I guess. 
[00:24:00]  They should play it funny, like to put their cleats on their hands and gloves on their feet.  And, like, do handstands.  If a team would have died before the first game, we have the same record.  You know what else?  Yeah.  Do you notice that the Alliance colors are the same as the handicap sign?  Oh, boy.  That's not nice.  People are starting to notice things like this.  Yeah, you notice that when your team's 0-15. 
[00:24:30]  We're living in this town, whatever.  What a crappy town.  All right, Robin.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Yeah.  All right.  Club Soda Kenny.  So, thank you for having me and my lovely wife at your abode on Saturday night.  It was my pleasure to rescue you.  Yeah, right.  How annoyed were you?  I wasn't at all.  I was hoping that we could get together since you were so close.  Yeah, because Kenny goes, wow, you guys are at Short Hills Mall.  You're real close.  What are you doing for dinner?  I'm like, ah, I'm going to eat with my brother. 
[00:25:00]  Then it's obvious that Kenny sabotaged your car.  He probably did.  So, you would have to go over his house.  He probably unhooked something while I was in the mall.  That's actually a good theory.  I was in a panic to get there because it's really close to my house, but when we come  off the highway, there was 50 cars backed up on the exit to get into the mall.  And then they had horses up blocking one of the entrances, so I just moved that, cut 
[00:25:30]  everybody off.  Yeah.  Then they have those mall security guards and people directing traffic, and they wanted  me to go around.  I go, no, you don't understand.  GH is in need of assistance.  For the people just tuning in, my car broke down at the Short Hills Mall in the third or  fourth level of the parking lot, which is a perfect place to break down this time of  year.  During the holidays.  But that parking lot is weird, too, because he was on the second level.  So, when you pull in and you go up to the second level, he wasn't there. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, no.  So, I went all the way up and had it come back.  But when you come back down, he's on the second level.  How does that work?  I don't know, because...  They also have, like, a road that goes right through the parking lot, the garage.  That's the highway or something.  Yeah.  Because I got stuck on the other side of the mall, had to make my way back.  It's the most bizarre place.  And I thought, when I went to get your truck Sunday morning, I go up to the second level,  it's not there.  I go, oh, they towed the car.  Oh, nice.  Because I, like, called for permission, like, said I was going to, like, leave it there, and 
[00:26:30]  they're going, like, you can't leave it there, because it's Christmas, and we need every  parking spot.  I go, look, we're leaving it there.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll get it out in the morning.  I want to thank the Short Hills Mall for spending at least 30 seconds on my car, by the way.  Thank you.  That was appreciated.  But then when I came up to the third and came back down, then it was magically there  on the second level.  Yeah.  How did they do that?  I don't know.  But we talked about that already.  So, then we go back to Kenny's house, and your wife made a lovely dinner. 
[00:27:00]  And, uh...  She's good like that.  And she had a little pasta thing, and I learned that Kenny has to have how many scoops?  You've got to be organized when you eat.  How many scoops, Kenny?  Yeah.  This is for real.  Get Jimmy's face out.  Jimmy, you've been eating with him for years, and you didn't know this?  If I find out that he's counting scoops of pasta, it has to have a certain number.  Dude, it's not even...  How many scoops, Kenny?  No, I start off with five.  It has to be five scoops.  So, I jokingly go, come on, you could have a six. 
[00:27:30]  And I...  His face got beet red, and his wife goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You guys get to go home.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Oh, no, you were going to put a six scoop in?  This is a goof.  Because I understand a little something-something about OCD, and the best thing to do is mess  with those people.  So, five scoops.  Five scoops.  He starts with five scoops, but if he's hungry, how many scoops then, Kenny?  Three to five.  Three to five.  Oh, wow.  You give yourself some leeway.  Yeah.  He allows three to five, but if you give him two, then that's a whole other problem. 
[00:28:00]  Now, do you have to completely finish the initial five scoops before you go for your three  to five?  Yeah, it's portion control.  So, the plate is clean, and then you can.  Yeah.  You can't have, like, two or three pieces of pasta and go, yeah, you know, I'm still hungry,  let me.  No, I'll finish it first.  Oh, of course you will.  That plate's got to be clean.  And what was the thing with putting the pasta on your fork all about?  Was that just like?  No, like you've got to organize the little zitties. 
[00:28:30]  No, you don't.  You've got to.  You've got to.  You've got to.  You've got to.  You've got to.  You've got to.  You've got to.  You've got to organize the little zitties.  Yeah, you line them up nice.  You line them up.  He lines up his pasta on his fork, and he's it that way.  And then you get one, like, if there's four prongs on the fork, you, like, grab four.  Well, it all depends on how big the ziti is.  Sometimes four won't fit.  Yeah.  I do.  I will be honest.  I have put two pieces of ziti, one on the end, tines. 
[00:29:00]  Just for fun, though.  No, no, no.  I'll usually eat like that.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah, because it's just better than poking at it.  Yeah.  These weren't the big scoff-a-tunes.  These were like penny pie.  A scoff-a-tune.  Yeah.  Penny.  Yeah.  Okay.  So you start with five scoops.  Yeah.  And then you allow yourself, if you want a second helping, to go three.  Yeah, and I backed it up with three more.  What was the other thing we learned?  I don't remember all of them.  Because then your wife just ran down the list, and I was dizzy. 
[00:29:30]  Now, wait a minute.  If you have five, and you're too full for even three, would you ever have two?  No, it's not the right thing.  Why would you eat five scoops of pasta?  No, it's like a spoonful.  It's like, you know.  Why don't you just have three and cut it out?  But the serving spoon.  It depends on how big the serving spoon is.  Yeah, it was a nice, you know, average-sized spoon.  We had a lovely dinner, by the way.  Did I mention that?  Ah, it sounds it. 
[00:30:00]  You guys couldn't have been nicer.  What was the other thing she taught me about your eating?  It was some other bizarre thing.  You don't remember?  I don't know, because it's like second nature to me, where it's odd to everyone else.  Well, then, going over to Kenny's house is like living in a sitcom, like one of those weird Fox sitcoms.  Because then Kenny goes, Kenny gets up, and if I'm going too far, you just slap me across the face.  But Kenny gets up and goes, I'm going to the bathroom.  And all of a sudden, his wife goes, oh, no, Kenny, make sure you turn on the fan right front of all of us. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, my God.  And then he leaves, and then we were talking about the fan that she bought for about five minutes.  She's like, look, I don't ask for much from Kenny or anybody else, but I know what I know.  And I demanded that we get, what, the high-power fan?  It's like a wind tunnel in there.  She goes, I demanded we get the high-power fan.  I don't ask her for many things, but this is something I needed. 
[00:31:00]  I was going to be courteous and use the bathroom in the basement.  Ah.  That is courteous.  And then she was talking about your, I was going to call it IMDB, but that would be a movie site.  I got one in two, Club Story of Kenny.  What is it called?  The irritable, IBS.  IBS.  All of a sudden, she's talking about his IBS.  Yeah, I got a spastic colon.  Nobody believes me.  I think the important thing, though, is in Kenny's household is the enchanting after-dinner conversations. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, apparently.  Yeah, it's like, Kenny, get the train schedule.  Yeah.  Yeah.  James had a lovely barbecue at my house.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  We didn't get into your bowels.  We're fan habits, though, unfortunately.  Yeah.  I guess I wasn't close enough to the family yet.  Yeah.  Once you're in, you're in.  I hope he's a made man now.  Yeah.  I had a chance to take the club, so did Kenny Fortune, because he decided he doesn't need  to, like, scrape the ice off his stoop. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Someone's going to break their neck, Kenny.  Yeah.  Thank goodness he didn't trip.  Yeah.  And also, Kenny, I have to say it, but you're about, what, 6'5"?  Yes.  He's got this tiny, tiny, tiny, and I mean tiny little dog that he just loves to death.  Aw.  It's a miniature pincher.  Oh, a little miniature pincher I've seen, though.  Yes.  10 pounds.  They're adorable.  He's 6'5".  So he looks silly with it.  And his wife's like, oh, he just spoils the hell out of the thing. 
[00:32:30]  Probably pets it and breaks its neck.  Oh, what have I done?  Oh, yeah, of mice and men.  Yeah.  It's like those videos that come out every once in a while of the gorilla holding the  little kitten in the zoo.  That's Kenny with his little dog.  And a strange relationship is developing.  Club soda, Kenny.  Yeah, they show the gorilla petting a cat.  It is a female dog, by the way.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  A bitch, they call them.  Yeah, I'll say.  You're holding back, though. 
[00:33:00]  There was something else with your eating, but I'll remember, and I'll bring it up.  Believe me, I wouldn't hold back.  If I had a thought in my head, it would be long way.  I knew you were organized, and I had my suspicions that you had a bit of the OCD in you, but  all right.  Steve from Bayshore is asking, did Kenny open up the staircase and introduce you to  Spot?  And then this morning, on the way to work, Kenny goes, I lost electricity for five minutes. 
[00:33:30]  I'm like, yeah, it happens, right?  Yeah.  What do we do?  We just go, ah, hopefully you got, like, an alarm clock that isn't plugged into the  wall.  Kenny goes, I had to get up, and I had to reset every clock in the house.  At the moment, the power came back on.  That's right.  He had to get up and reset everything.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  Why?  Why?  And his wife told me that their clocks are exact to the second.  Oh, you don't set one ahead a little, so you're okay?  Nope. 
[00:34:00]  Synchronized.  Nope.  To the nuclear atomic clock.  Atomic clock.  Atomic clock.  Because we had a train schedule, and my Blackberry's at least five to six minutes fast, I think,  or slow.  I don't know, because whatever.  Yeah.  We don't want it slow.  So we're trying to figure out what, you know, what is the real time so I don't miss the train  back to New York.  And his wife goes, trust me, you see that clock right there?  That is the exact, that's better than a NASA clock.  You got to be punctual.  Well, of course. 
[00:34:30]  It's, you know, a couple of, you know, so he had to get up in the middle of the night.  Seconds don't matter, though.  To reset every clock in his house, because they're all digital.  Yeah, and they blink.  They don't blink in other rooms.  I know, but I just, you know, my alarm clock.  I mean, they are blinking in other rooms, but you don't see it.  I know, but it's on my mind.  So I had a.  Yeah.  But thank you, Kenny.  You saved us on Saturday.  Well, it was my pleasure.  You know, because you know what my greatest fear is?  What? 
[00:35:00]  Not being there.  Ugh.  Yeah, it doesn't sound like so.  Over the time.  He's doofy and he's doofy.  He sounds a little noppy.  A man's servant to Opie.  He's love soda, Kenny.  He's got his daily checklist.  He starts with Opie's breakfast.  He's on him like a necklace.  He's love soda, Kenny.  Security.  XPD. 
[00:35:30]  OCD.  Whatever you need to call him, no wonder Opie doors him.  He wipes out beef parkour him.  He's love soda, Kenny.  There you go.  Thanks, Kenny.  A lot of shoehorning.  Yeah, a little bit.  In that tune.  We haven't played that one in a while.  All right, when we get back, we'll talk some plane crashes.  Yeah, a little plane crashes.  We'll talk that.  And remember the tree man?  We brought the folks that story a while ago.  One of the stories of the year.  We got an update on tree man. 
[00:36:00]  What's wrong?  I'm just looking at his picture.  Really?  Yes.  I haven't seen the picture yet.  It's fun to watch him smoke.  And Jimmy, how are our ticket sales for the Borgata?  Oh, the third show's on sale for Sunday, the 18th of January.  I believe the first two are both sold out.  I don't know.  Actually, I have to call Pete today.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Rich Voss is here.  Get him in.  Opie and Anthony.  We're going to move on.  But Kenny's wife texted. 
[00:36:30]  The other thing with Kenny's eating, he has to start with 50 tortellinis.  50?  He has to start.  Isn't that...  That's a lot of food.  But then again, he's 6'5".  I don't even care about how much food it is as far as the food part of it goes.  That just seems like it would take a long time to do, to count out 50 tortellinis.  Well, if you've been doing it for years, I'm sure he's got a nice little system. 
[00:37:00]  He's still got a kind of, you know, count.  Yeah.  5, 10.  But that was the other thing.  If they have tortellini, it has to be 50 to start on his plate at one time.  Why would she feed into that?  She should scoop some on and go eat these, stupid.  Yeah.  Count them later.  Dude, when I try to mess with it, his face turned beet red like he was trying to be polite.  And his wife's like, please don't do that.  You get to leave.  I have to stay here.  I'd just love to know what he believes would happen.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  That's a good question.  If it goes off that whole thing.  I don't know what the whole OCD thing is.  Like, what do you think is going to happen?  Yeah.  Maybe it's just that you don't want that weird feeling you get if, you know, you go against it.  I don't know.  His wife goes to work with a black guy, and they go, 49 tortellinis.  Yeah.  Hasn't come to that.  You know what, though?  Teddy's wife's small, but she gets scrap.  OCD behavior, like, if you're having addictive personality, too, it also is part of, like, OCD behavior. 
[00:38:00]  Like, I have it not like that.  Like, I'll be laying in bed or in a hotel, and if my dresser drawer is open, like, a quarter of an inch, I have to get up and close it.  Really?  Yeah, just, like, weird stuff.  You come in the house, and you check everything.  We all have a little, like, OCDs in us, but, you know.  I don't think it's OCD.  I think, like, you do have certain...  Well, they've labeled it, but...  But, no, I mean, like, people's personalities, I think that's what it is.  Right.  If you do certain little things. 
[00:38:30]  But then OCD is when it becomes just an obsession.  Obviously, it's part of the old.  But when it starts affecting things like that, then you have some kind of problem.  But just wanting to close the drawers for some reason, it's silly.  It doesn't make much sense.  You can leave the drawer open, but, you know.  What about if you get the urge every now and then to push your wife in front of a bus?  Is that some...  All right.  That all depends on the wife.  That would be...  Yeah.  What she's been doing or been like or... 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Getting a sigh out of...  What's the matter?  What's wrong, Rich?  It's a nonstop fight.  Nonstop fight.  Why?  You guys haven't even been married that long.  Three years.  Listen, it's a...  Do you say, I want a fur coat?  And she goes, all right, I'll give you one made out of mice?  That's right.  Why are you guys fighting?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Let me get marriage tips from two months of marriage.  One more fighting.  One month today.  One month today.  Thanks for keeping track.  Oh, happy anniversary.  Yes.  Happy anniversary to you.  To you. 
[00:39:30]  The good thing about my wife, for Christmas, she wanted a...  What do you call it?  A navigating system?  Divorce?  Yeah.  A navigating system?  Yeah.  I don't forget what they're called.  Hopefully, you're getting a Latino or something.  A navigating system.  That just drives her around.  With a GPS?  Yeah.  And I kind of wanted it myself, so that was good.  But it's just fighting.  I don't know.  It's just nonstop. 
[00:40:00]  What are you fighting over?  Yeah, what are you fighting over?  She was, like, sick yesterday.  Right.  And I wanted to go to the Christmas party.  Sorry, Rich.  What party did you want to go to?  Just in New York.  One of the comedy clubs.  But it was no big deal.  Caroline's tonight.  Yeah, yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah.  That's it.  Tell this crew out there.  Who cares?  Oh, like they're going to charge the door to see Rich Voss at a Christmas party at 16 degrees out.  Just like they did with the Beatles, right, Rich?  That's your sick mind and your dreams. 
[00:40:30]  What an idiot.  There might be one dope on the sidewalk going, wow, there's Rich Voss.  He's going to have a picture.  No one's going to run to Caroline's for their Christmas party tonight.  Whatever.  You fight.  You fight.  You've been married, you know.  You just fight over everything.  An abomination.  Then why'd you get married?  As soon as the fighting starts, I'm out.  I'm out.  But three years.  To fight three years in, that's a little soon to start the fighting. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, you guys are done.  Yeah, it is.  You guys are done as a couple.  You know that.  No, we're not.  Any relationship I've had, the fighting hadn't started for a good seven years.  We just need a TV show.  Once we sell a show, then we'll get along together again.  Then everything will be okay, right?  Is that how it works?  Then everything will be okay.  Oh, you're in trouble.  You're in trouble.  Oh, boy.  Does the baby have anything to do with it?  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  It does.  Well, here's the thing.  I like to call those relationship destroyers, by the way.  I love the baby, but she expects me to do a lot more, besides running the business in the house.  She'll say, I feel sick, and you want your baby.  I go, no.  Well, who's supposed to?  Huh?  Who's supposed to at that point?  Do you have stuff to do?  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  I had a party to go to.  All right.  So she's not allowed to get sick, is what you're telling her. 
[00:42:00]  You know, I think, well, whatever.  Well, she was sick, and you wanted to go to, what, the Stanton, New York party or whatever?  Comic strip or whatever.  Okay, you wanted to go to the strip party in the afternoon, and she needed help around the house.  Yeah.  And you're like, look, I know you're sick, and the baby is here, but I want to go to the Christmas party.  Yeah.  I went out and bought her firewood.  It's not like I wasn't doing anything.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Jimmy put that right in perspective.  Well, no, no, no, because, I mean, maybe because Bonnie is a comedian. 
[00:42:30]  Thank you, David.  I would also love to go to the Christmas party, too.  She's not a civilian.  And I would love to have gone with you.  But she was sick and had to take care of the baby.  And the baby's only, what, less than two years old, right?  Yeah, 16 months.  16 months.  So, yeah, you know what?  She should have stepped up.  You're right, Rich.  Yeah.  And you said, no, I want to go to the Christmas party.  She said, I'm selfish and self-centered.  Yeah, she's right.  Boy, I hope she takes you for everything you're worth.  What?  Yes, I really do.  Oh, God.  That'd be the shortest divorce case ever. 
[00:43:00]  $80?  Look, I know the guy code.  You're supposed to stick up with the guy.  But you're, like, ridiculous.  No, I do a lot.  She's sick with a kid at home and you're bitching?  Sick.  That's not really sick, you know?  A little cough.  Yeah.  Wow.  Real sick, okay?  You're from, you're a farm girl.  Handle it, all right?  I'm with Rich on this one.  Really?  I'll tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, the only thing you have against you is the fact that you're married.  Yeah.  The thing is, I consider myself the same type of personality. 
[00:43:30]  I like doing what I want to do.  That's why I've never had kids.  Because if she was just sick, she's sick.  You're not.  You go out.  But now that there's a baby in there, someone's got to take care of the baby.  So now it screws up your whole time.  You should be able to just go out and go to a party.  But now your whole thing's screwed up because you decided at 70 you want another kid.  Yeah, you were done.  I know.  You were done. 
[00:44:00]  Now you have to start over.  I love the baby.  I love carrying her in and showing her off and doing the fun stuff.  I don't even know what that word was.  What?  Carrying her?  Carrying her into places.  I looked at Jimmy.  Jimmy looked at me.  That's a new word.  Carrying.  Yeah.  You know.  But you know what?  I'm old.  I raise kids.  It's tough to, you know what I mean?  You already did that.  I did it.  So you don't want to do it again.  So you fought with her yesterday, right?  She wanted you to stay home and help her.  Yeah.  So I ended up.  I did it.  Oh, you stay home.  And I said, go take a nap.  She couldn't sleep.  And then, you know, it's just a fight. 
[00:44:30]  I did the food shopping.  I went out.  Bore firewood.  Started a fire.  You know.  And, you know.  In the house trying to get rid of Bonnie.  You're like, like, like, like, like, like, oh, man.  God damn it.  On Golden Pond.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's right.  Norman Thayer.  You saved it.  Stupid as doddering around the house with a fire on the sofa.  What an idiot.  On the sofa.  Austin has a weird look in his eyes. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  It's all.  It's a distant look.  Yeah.  Everything.  I get anxiety.  Everything's breaking.  Your car.  My car.  Everything.  You know.  I just.  It's everything.  She's leaving them all for Canada.  Without you.  I wasn't going.  Why?  I got to work.  I got to work.  Well, she's got Christmas with the family, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Up there in Canada.  Yeah.  And you're spending it.  Where?  At a chuckle hut somewhere?  What are you doing?  A chuckle hut?  What chuckle hut are you going to be?  What am I doing Christmas?  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  I'm working Christmas Eve and Christmas night.  I don't care.  You know, I'm a superior religion.  But.  Superior religion.  And I count my Christmas night and Christmas Eve, but I'll spend that with my, you know,  my daughters.  I'll go to my ex-wife's house for Christmas.  Oh, okay.  With the other family.  Wait, you're going to hang with your ex-wife?  Yeah.  That is.  You are.  Her husband must love that.  He's going with the other family.  His new family is going to be up in Canada with a new baby, which isn't going to see daddy  for Christmas.  Pretty much the first real Christmas the baby's going to see, because, you know. 
[00:46:00]  And Rich is spending it with the other family.  Because last year the kid was too young to understand it.  The grown-up family.  What are you doing?  What's that?  And you wonder why you're fighting all the time.  Dude.  She wants you in Canada.  This could possibly.  I'm not saying you're wrong, but this has nothing to do really with right and wrong.  This is just the way things are.  You are screwing up by the numbers on this one.  That's not true.  I'm giving a ride to the airport.  It's not like I'm not doing anything.  Oh, my God.  The old get out.  Get out. 
[00:46:30]  Curbside chicken.  I'll be leaving.  I was already booked in a place when she decided to go.  Yeah, what?  You didn't understand that it was going to be Christmas?  Maybe you don't book Christmas and you spend it with your family.  Well, because I booked us up in Canada in April to go up there.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  You've been working these clubs for over 30 years.  I think they would understand if you go, look, I've got to take this one off and do  the right thing and be with my wife's family in Canada.  How about you?  You don't book Christmas one year.  Dude, you...  This year and you spend it with Bonnie and the family and the kids. 
[00:47:00]  I went last year.  Are you dead?  Dude, you married a piece of ass.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Trying to survive.  I'm trying to survive.  Wow.  It's not that easy.  You know, your car breaks.  I'll go buy a car.  No big deal.  Yeah, I'm going to.  My car broke my computer.  How about I give you my old car?  I know.  It has a few good miles on it still.  Exactly.  A few.  I just hit 100,000.  Three.  Really? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, you get a year or two out of it.  That's good.  I'll give you my car.  Will that help you?  No.  No, it won't help me.  I'll just put another negative thing in my life that I have to work on or worry about.  What's wrong with your computer?  That's done.  My car.  You know, you go to warm up your car and leave it warm, you know, when it's all ice to warm  it up, I turn my car and I went inside to warm it up.  Well, old dummy here doesn't realize the windshield wipers are on, so I burnt out the motor on  the windshield wiper because it was kind of straining. 
[00:48:00]  You know, in a car you smell burnt wire.  Yeah, it's always good.  You know, it's just another $1,000 right there.  Are you in money trouble?  Do you need money?  No.  No.  No.  I'm not giving any.  I'm just curious.  Really?  Yeah, we just want to rub it in.  We were hoping you would say yes.  The holidays are a weird time, Rich.  I guess Opie's Christmas present sent me back a little.  Yeah.  Yes, I did.  But that's about it.  I'm not giving out Christmas presents to anybody.  No, I mean your wedding present.  Sorry.  Can you even give me anything?  Yes.  You didn't get that nice present in the box? 
[00:48:30]  What did you get me?  In the box.  Was it from that SNL song?  What did I get you?  Yeah.  Thanks, Mike.  They were very, very nice candlestick holders.  Oh, yes.  Very nice.  Yeah, they were really nice.  Like Waterford Crystal or something.  Whatever it is.  So you didn't even pick it out.  I did, too.  I went there and I had a fight with the people.  By the way, they're still in the box.  I picked it out on the way to your wedding.  What are they, candles?  Yeah.  I got a whole pile of stuff I'll never use.  Yeah.  Print those out for the holidays.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Those candles around the holidays are great.  I'm re-wrapping.  I'm returning.  Oh.  I'm doing all sorts of stuff.  Those are great for the Castle Dracula.  Why don't you give those back to me as my wedding gift, and I'll return them and get  your cash.  All right.  I said sorry a million times, all right?  What do you want from me?  No, they're nice, though.  Don't re-gift those.  I'll re-gift them to someone I care about.  I'm not going to give them to just some schmuck.  I'll give them to someone I really like.  By the way, if I get Waterford, Kendall, I'm throwing them through your, I was going 
[00:49:30]  to say window, but then I realized you live on the 38th floor, so I guess I won't be  doing that.  If you were on the 37th floor, you couldn't reach it, okay?  But I'm on the 37th floor.  I'm on the 10th floor.  No, you don't.  I got it.  All right.  So Rich is just bringing down the whole show with his depression.  No, I'm not depressed at all.  Anthony knows.  I'm just saying.  Anthony knows, but you decided at your age to get married again and have a kid, so now 
[00:50:00]  you're in.  And I don't mind.  So now you have to do the right thing.  I do do the right thing.  I found the daycare.  Like, don't bitch because she's sick and has to stay home with a kid.  You, um...  What?  I don't know.  You probably shouldn't have booked Christmas.  Oh, I thought you were going to say you probably shouldn't have got married.  Well, look, I've...  No, she is fine.  I've read that riot act a few times on the air, so you all know my opinion on that one.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  But, uh...  Yeah, once you did it, you know, you stepped in.  You stepped in and you're married, you got a kid, and now you're in the position...  This is what I talk about all the time.  Your freedom's gone.  And then you're using your career as an excuse.  I feel so horrible now.  I'm not going up there.  I feel guilty.  You really should.  I'm just...  No, I'm not saying you should.  You shouldn't.  Do whatever you want.  It's not like she's going up there for Groundhog Day.  It's Christmas.  Do whatever you want.  Pop a zanix and move on.  But, you know, whatever you got... 
[00:51:00]  Whatever gets you through.  But, Jesus...  How long, Rich?  How long will she be up there for?  How long after Christmas?  Probably the paper said forever.  No, probably...  The paper said forever.  Like a week or so.  So, why can't you go up the day after Christmas and just surprise her and say,  Look, I want to come up and spend the week with her up there.  Because I'm working those days, too.  Oh, are you?  Wait, does she understand or, like, you know...  And surprise her?  Does she understand or deep down is she kind of, like, looking at you like,  you son of a...  No, no. 
[00:51:30]  Well, first of all, you can't surprise somebody.  You know, it's not a fun surprise when you fly to Edmonton and then drive four hours  to the end of the earth.  All right, you don't have to surprise her.  Surprise, I'm alive.  Okay?  To the end of the earth.  To the end of the earth.  All right, so surprise.  Paul shows up with snowshoes.  So, why don't you cancel your gig and go home and go,  Good news, I'm going to Canada with you, after all.  It would cost me thousands to cancel my gig, the money I'm making this week,  and then to fly...  Financially, it can't... 
[00:52:00]  You know, I'm going to do something sweet for her today.  Steve from Bayshore is saying,  Voss, wasn't killing Jesus enough for you, now you're killing Bonnie's fun, too?  Does she want you to go up with her?  That's because they both mouth off.  Does she want you to go up with her, or is she like,  No, you've got to make them cash?  No.  She understands.  She understands.  You know, it's more about just bringing the baby to show her family can see the baby.  They don't care about us.  What do they care about me?  Some, you know, Jew? 
[00:52:30]  What, the guy that married their little girl?  Exactly.  Perhaps.  They're so happy I did that, you know, I got a pass.  What, are you kidding me?  I got a pass.  Unbelievable.  All right, Rich.  Well, Rich, what are we promoting today?  Well, on New Year's Eve, I'm at the Treehouse in Danbury.  Why spend that with your wife or kids?  I got her on.  She's on a gig with me.  She'll be back.  All right.  That would be fun, Barry.  All right.  Why don't you go up to Canada?  Book a nice Continental Connecting flight through Denver.  Yeah.  That was Continental, like Jimmy said.  And Jimmy turned us all on at Continental, and I'm like, wow. 
[00:53:00]  That'd be a toboggan ride with every flight.  I always felt safe, but now, you know, this is everyone's worst nightmare when they're taking off.  Dude, everyone lived.  That is fantastic.  I understand that.  That's fantastic.  And the better news.  I understand that.  Credit to the safety.  Is all the One Pass members for that trip were given 800 frequent flyer feet.  Yeah, how do they work that?  How do they officially work that?  What an insult that would be.  That's a good one. 
[00:53:30]  I missed platinum.  Sorry, sir, you missed platinum this year.  The wings fell off.  Right.  We understand, sir, but the writing is that until you complete the trip, and instead you  were lollygagging in the shrubs.  Jimmy, the other thing, everyone also got a free upgrade of first class.  I want to know how many people.  They went flying forward.  That's a flying forward joke.  How many people were running off the plane and just sat in the first class seat really  quick?  Oh, it is comfy. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, it is nice here.  Down the slide.  Would you have grabbed your stuff over the overhead?  Before I would have grabbed a child.  Well, listen.  My laptop is coming.  Of course.  Of course.  You've got to get your laptop.  My laptop.  They all survived.  The takeoff in Denver went horribly wrong.  I think they were up in the air slightly.  They were just taking off.  Right.  And the guy aborted the takeoff because, for some reason, it didn't seem like they had  enough power.  Yeah.  It slammed down on the runway.  Yeah.  And then veered off to the left.  Into some kind of ditch. 
[00:54:30]  Into just the ground around the runway, which luckily, there's no structures there.  There's just a couple of roads that they ran over, but it looked like pretty much an open  field.  A little bumpy.  The engine got knocked off and the wings are bashed apart.  And on fire and all that.  Yeah, yeah.  They said they felt the heat inside.  On takeoff, man, that thing is just, you know, fuel-laden, so they are lucky.  That's the worst.  I'd rather crash on landing than takeoff. 
[00:55:00]  Really?  I mean, yeah, because you have a better chance.  I'd rather not crash.  Make it through the whole flight and then you crash.  That sucks.  A lot of audio is on TV, but we found one clip that has to be played.  Mm-hmm.  Because, you know, we found out all 38 survived, right?  No, more than that.  No, there were 110.  Oh, 110.  38.  38 injured.  I'm sorry.  We were injured and 107 of those are still in the hospital.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Right.  It could have been a lot worse because of this clip we're about to play.  Yeah.  In Denver, flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been recovered from that fiery runway crash. 
[00:55:30]  The NTSB hopes that the new discoveries help them figure out what caused the Continental Airlines jet  to veer off the runway and burst into flames on Saturday.  Now, one family tells their story of this horrible event.  On my side of the plane, I could see the engine.  I noticed it was on fire.  I could feel the heat coming from the window.  I grabbed my son from my husband because I was first one out.  And I can remember we were in the aisle and I didn't want to leave without my husband. 
[00:56:00]  She's first out.  You effing bitch.  She's first out of the plane, but she almost didn't leave the plane because she didn't want to leave without her husband.  Did you hear?  She was in the aisle.  In the aisle.  And she didn't want to leave and wait.  And believe me, she was a fatso.  She was a big woman.  She's the one.  She's the reason people die.  Right.  Because they can't get past that behemoth.  Right.  She's going to sit there and wait for her husband as maybe the plane is engulfed in fire.  Get out.  Exactly. 
[00:56:30]  Get the F out.  Yeah, move.  Her husband didn't want to come out.  He wanted to stay in there.  Yeah.  Burn up rather than be with that pig.  He could finally watch the monitor without her talking.  He's trying to finish Ghost Town without Piggy Girl chit-chatting in his ear.  Right.  Food, food, food, food.  In the aisle waiting.  Waiting.  That's wonderful.  That's scary because I don't want to depend on anyone else, man.  They are pouring on the drama with this.  Believe me, this looks horrifying if you're on there.  But talking burst into flames, fiery wreck. 
[00:57:00]  Look at the plane.  We've seen planes that have been involved in fiery wrecks.  They're gutted.  They get gutted.  They explode.  This thing, it looks like the engine came off and it went on fire.  But the fuel, it doesn't look like the fuel tanks went.  Look at it.  My guessing is dented up, but it's not burned.  But with the fire, I mean, that thing could have exploded at any second.  Look, there's not a sign that there was anywhere that there was fire aside from the engine.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  And the engines, of course, if you go off the runway and they start picking up dirt and everything else,  because the landing gear broke, you're going to kick out fire.  You think they'll fly that plane again?  That thing is junk.  I wonder if it was, I'm guessing ice on the wings and the way they could not get up and the weight kept it there.  And it smashed back down and the impact might have caused it to catch on fire because it was loaded with fuel.  That's the engines.  But look at the wings.  The wings would have exploded and the main fuel tanks didn't explode. 
[00:58:00]  So the heat and fire that you feel from the engines, of course.  But it wasn't like, if that was a fiery wreck, there would have been dead people.  That's what kills people like that when you don't have a cataclysmic, you know, rolling crash from 35,000 feet that leaves nothing but a ditch.  Which, it's always that fire that gets you.  That's it for me.  No more flying anytime soon.  What?  Actually, this was the...  So it's not like they're sending us anywhere these days? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  This is the first crash in maybe for the whole year, right?  They had a really good year.  Well, that's the first time Continental.  They had a really good year.  That's the first time Continental ever crashed, too.  The first ever.  For Continental.  Continental's had...  They must have had one.  They've had it since before.  Yeah.  Yeah, Rich.  They've had some crashes.  They've had a few.  But Qantas hasn't crashed.  Oh, great.  Me and Ant were joking before how they are so due.  Yeah, no kidding.  Who's going on a Qantas flight anytime soon?  What did Jim say? 
[00:59:00]  What's going to happen when they finally go, there's going to be six of their planes head on into a nuclear reactor.  It is not going to be a pretty...  When they go down, it's going to be ugly.  All right.  Yes, sir, Stunt.  It was a double-dip weekend for Continental.  A Continental Express jet ran into a snowbank in Albany.  While taxiing on the runway.  They had to actually dig it out.  It was snow in a bank.  It was no steep.  I can't get a bank.  There's a lot worse banks.  You could walk out with a mouthful from. 
[00:59:30]  Snow bank, I'll take.  Rich Voss is here.  Yes.  We're going to take a quick break.  We're going to continue with an update on Tree Man.  He's that guy with the deformity that makes his hands and feet look like roots of a tree.  Remember him?  One of the grossest things I've ever seen in my life.  You've seen him, Rich?  Yeah, in The Wizard of Oz.  He was throwing apples at Darby's.  No, not that tree man.  What if tree man, look at there, there's his hands.  What if he was making a cake and he whipped up a bunch of the icing and then took some 
[01:00:00]  out with that hand and said, here, and wanted you to lick it off of his finger?  Would you do that?  I wouldn't lick it off his finger if he had just dipped his finger into the fountain  of youth.  All right.  I'd say beat it, bark hands.  Get out of here before my dog gives your hand a good wedding.  With that, we go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[01:00:30]  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  Oh, I want to give a big FU to my wife for getting mad at me for FU next to her in bed.  Maybe if you've had sex with me more than once a month since you've gotten married, maybe  I wouldn't FU so much and ruin our bed and make the bed squeak so you can't fall asleep.  You know what?  I'm going to keep FU and I'm going to keep saying FU.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big FU to Caroline Kennedy just because you have a famous name. 
[01:01:00]  You think you can run for senator in New York.  You dumb bitch.  But you didn't know where Buffalo was until you came to visit it yesterday.  FU, F David Patterson for your cat's hikes.  And F*** New York State.  Last one leaving, turn out the lights.  Next message.  I want to give a big FU to everyone who says happy holiday.  It's Fing Christmas, so say Merry Christmas.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big FU to our governor, Peterson, who's going to raise welfare by 30% over the next three years. 
[01:01:30]  Are you a f***ing f***ing f***ing moron?  What the hell is wrong with this city?  F*** you.  Next message.  To my stupid neighbor across the street who's got $300 to spend on big blow-up stuff that talks, Christmas decorations,  but you can't spend $20 on a nice little set of classless horizontal blinds.  Nobody wants to see in your white trash house with your disgusting couches and a kid hanging knees off each of all your d***s.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to say FU to the guy I called right before me. 
[01:02:00]  Your FU sucked and I hope you get tooth cancer.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Christopher Walken, right?  That's what you think?  When you hear this?  Yep.  Anybody with me?  He made the video.  Well, he was the star of the video.  This is Fat...  This is Fat Boy Slim. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  He was doing some huffing.  Kind of like a few Fat Boy Slim songs.  Yeah, he had those jeans he gave us.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  He was very cool.  Opie and Anthony, Rich Vos in studio, playing some chuckle hut somewhere for Christmas while  everyone else is...  New Year's Eve at the treehouse in Denver.  All right, New Year's Eve.  Right on.  Oh, cool.  I'll be in downtown Pennsylvania, Crocodile Rock.  We should call each other.  Hey, HSBC banker kills himself. 
[01:03:00]  A leading HSBC banker hanged himself with a belt in the closet of a five-star hotel room.  Investigators found it as soon as I know it.  It's not clear.  We give a D-O-R before he left.  What?  Before he hung himself.  D-O-R.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't hear the way.  So I don't know why the banker killed himself, but I'm really broken up that a banker in these  times decided to hang himself.  Oh, well.  What a shame.  That's just terrible. 
[01:03:30]  Terrible.  Officer and gentleman.  See, I just want you to know I'm with you.  What's up?  A lot of these...  A lot of the bank...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go with the phone number.  Nah, it's just radio stuff.  Who cares?  Go.  The banks, I was noticing, I was looking at like Westbury Music Fair, which isn't called  the Westbury Music Fair and hasn't been for a while.  It was the North Fork Theater.  It's not the North Fork Theater.  Really?  Yeah, now it's something else.  It's called the Bailout Theater.  Banks, yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Naming something after a bank is the dumbest thing you can do these days.  Yeah.  The name won't last the year.  The way the banks are scooping each other up and emerging and taking over and just folding.  You name something after a bank and you've got to change the name.  Yeah.  So now it's something else.  Westbury Music Fair is now called something else.  I hate they changed the names of all our stadiums.  What is the new state's name? 
[01:04:30]  Is it going to be Citi Field or something?  The Bank of Saudi Arabia.  Yeah, that's what they'll all end up.  And the new Westbury Music Fair is now called the Capital One Bank Theater.  Capital One Bank.  Ew.  The Capital One Bank Theater.  It was a North Fork Bank Theater.  Now it's Capital One.  But they just all, banks are scooping each other up or folding.  So why would you name anything after a bank?  Citi Field.  Isn't that for Citibank?  Yeah, I believe so.  I wonder how long that's going to be. 
[01:05:00]  Right.  Before they get sucked up by something else.  The Bank of America Field.  Yeah, the names just suck.  What is Citi Field, though?  Isn't that just like the New York City?  That's not a bank name, is it?  It is.  It's for Citibank.  Citibank.  C-I-T-I.  C-I-T-I, right.  Yes.  Hey, we were going to play, we were going to talk about Tree Man and his warts, but we  almost forgot.  Rich Voss is in the studio, so I think we should play, are we ready to play?  We're putting them in order.  Oh, we're putting them in order? 
[01:05:30]  We're going to play Name That Celebrity today.  You forgot, right?  Oh!  And who wasn't here for that?  I wasn't.  Oh, Jimmy.  It is a lot of fun.  Actually, just to bring everyone on board.  Hey, uh, E-Rock, where is that?  I said I didn't need it, but now I need it.  I forgot about that.  Because these guys need a minute or two.  All right, E-Rock.  Wow, E-Rock.  I've never seen him run before.  That's really weird.  That's six months worth of exercise.  Look at that.  I think it's blood pressure.  Lay down.  Lay down.  Lay down. 
[01:06:00]  I bet you we're going to walk in, he'll be passed down face first on the office floor.  Same joke as Mike just felt.  Good move, Jim.  Just to bring everyone on board.  Introducing Name That Actor on the Opie and Anthony Show with your favorite non-actor,  Rich Voss.  Yeah, hold on.  I got gum in my mouth.  And now for our first question.  All right, I'm ready.  This actor was Remington Steele and starred in several James Bond movies.  Who is it, Rich?  Uh, I'm Pierce Bronson. 
[01:06:30]  Right?  Right?  I knew he was going to say that.  What?  This actor starred opposite Heath Ledger in the controversial Brokeback Mountain.  Who are we talking about, Rich?  Oh, uh, Dylan Ward.  Dylan Ward.  What?  Something.  Dylan Ward.  It's got a couple names on the end of it, right?  This actor is best known for playing big parts and retards.  Who is it, Rich?  And no, it's not you.  Oh.  Stay tuned for another edition of Celebrity Password, only on the Opie and Anthony Show, 
[01:07:00]  hopefully starring Rich Voss, because he's dumb.  Voss, I wish we just had a live feed into your brain so we didn't have to go through the  bowl of your mouth getting out of the words.  Nice.  Wow.  Well, you want to play today, Rich? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, man.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  What do I got?  Do we have audio of these people?  Huh?  Do we have audio of these guys?  No, it's just the...  What happens, this is what's going to happen.  I got a pile of celebrity pictures in front of me.  I'm going to show Jimmy and Anthony the picture, and we'll decide which one we want to show  Rich, and then he'll attempt to name the celebrity.  It'll be very obvious to everybody out there.  Okay.  All right?  Oh, I see.  So do we want him to name this one?  Yes. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's a good one.  All right, Rich, you ready?  That's a good one.  Hold on.  Yeah, go ahead.  Why do you have to hold on to your seat?  I was going to see if I was going to get my glasses to see if I could see it.  Are you serious?  Come on, Rich, hang in there, please.  Please hang in there for a few more years.  We're losing you.  All right, where?  Let's go.  Oh.  Married to Demi Moore.  Yeah, I know who that is.  Married to Demi Moore.  I'm going to get this right from the beginning, so...  Ashton Kushner. 
[01:08:30]  Told you.  Kushner.  Don Kushner.  And please, we'll make good radio out of this no matter what.  Don't, like, give us the, you know, the answer we're hoping for.  He won't.  No.  All right.  Oh, he won't.  All right, good.  No.  Ashton Kushner is right.  Okay, so I'm one for one.  One for one.  Very good, Rich.  I don't know why you laughed.  I don't... 
[01:09:00]  Certainly are.  Too obscure for him?  Probably, right?  I say try it.  I don't know who she is even.  I don't...  Honestly, I don't know her name.  I don't know her name.  We'll pass her now.  She's hot.  We'll pass.  We'll put her over there.  All right.  All right.  Here's a good one.  This is too easy, though, actually.  If he gets this one wrong.  Well, yes, recently in a movie.  Well, Jimmy saw the movie this weekend.  The Wrestler.  Oh, I loved it. 
[01:09:30]  This is the star of The Wrestler.  Oh, I don't even have to look at it.  Who?  Oh.  Who?  Mickey Rourke.  All right.  Mickey Rourke.  That was too easy.  Yeah.  Mickey Rourke.  You got to throw him a bone every so often.  How good was The Wrestler?  Really good film.  I like it a lot.  A lot.  Sam Part is a lot of people won't go see that movie.  Probably not.  They'd rather go see Yes Man and all this other crap that's funny.  Everyone's saying Ghost Town was funny.  I love that movie.  I cried like a little bitch at the end of the movie.  Me, too.  Me, too.  Bob Kelly was even good in that.  Yeah.  Bobby just worked in it.  He belonged there. 
[01:10:00]  He was Bobby Connect.  Yeah.  He didn't really have much to say, but he was just.  Did he talk in the movie?  Yeah, one line.  Okay.  But he was kind of hanging out in this big, dumb, expressive face.  He looked good, though.  Big, dumb, expressive.  No, he had two lines.  He had an earlier.  Yeah, he was good.  Did you cry at the end?  Yeah.  Me, too.  I was on the plane.  Yeah, so was I.  Yeah.  With the sunglasses.  No, crying on the plane?  It's awful.  A couple of fruits.  How lowly are you guys?  Jesus.  No, it was.  I didn't cry, but I held back.  I wept like a wash woman.  I had to stop the movie and then watch it on the flight back.

But do you like The Wrestler, Jimmy?  I did love it, man.  It was amazing, wasn't it?  Yeah.  What do you think of Marissa Tomei, naked?  Oh, dude, she was pretty hot for her.  Yeah, man.  She was really good.  And, you know, me and the broad I was watching with both enjoyed it.  Then I had to give her a mouthful of you-know-what.  Knuckles.

I'm brilliant on stage, folks.  Because you did so well, we're going to write out  his name, and all you have to do is  read it. And all you have to do is  read his name. A very famous  movie star, Transformers.  There's his name written  down. Oh, Shia LaBeouf.  Are you serious?  Shia LaBeouf. 
[01:23:30]  Shia LaBeouf.  Shia. How do you say the  first name? Shia. Well, you got the first  name pretty close. LaBeouf.  Kill on stage. I never  fail. I never fail on stage. You're killing  here, too. It's great.  It's very funny. Killing my credibility. People  are going to think I'm dumb. I have a 141  IQ. Well, you don't have a 141  IQ. I'll do it  anytime. I'll take the test anytime.  Those internet IQ tests is what you took.  Right. Yeah. You don't. 
[01:24:00]  Click on another link. They add  a hundred points.  Well, there you go. Shia LaBeouf.  Ends today's  installment of Name That Celebrity with  Rich Walsh. Wow, Rich. You were good,  too. You were well. I think you had two out of three.  Yeah, you did. You started out strong,  and then you fell apart. Completely fell  apart. I don't think you got one right after that.  Ashton Kushner? Yeah, I know people like, you  know, old school. You know. Who?  Dustin Hoffman. People like that, you 
[01:24:30]  know. Who doesn't know him?  Everyone knows him. You want to relate  to the kids out there. You got to know what's  going on. I don't do that. You can't  keep doing Dustin Hoffman jokes.  Elaine.  All right, Rich is going to be at the  Tree Fort. The Tree House.  Uh-oh.  In Danbury, New Year's Eve.  Richard. And Uncle Vinny's this  weekend. But the Tree House in Danbury,  New Year's Eve, Uncle Vinny's this weekend.  Very, very good. Okay, we're going to take  a break, and we got Nick DiPaolo  stopping in today as well. Busy, busy 
[01:25:00]  show. It's Opie and Anthony.  Got a full house today, Opie and Anthony.  Our second to last show for the year,  I do believe, right? We got to do tomorrow,  too. Yeah, of course.  We have the pleasure of coming in  tomorrow and doing another program  as we call it. And then  we get to rest  and regroup.  What a year. A little 
[01:25:30]  vacation. What an effing  year for us. That's all  I'm going to say. What a year. Rich Voss in  studio playing the Tree Fort.  Tree House. Tree House, New Year's  Eve. Tree Fort.  Someone's Tree Fort. He's just...  And we got Nick DiPaolo in studio.  Nick. How are you, Nick?  Hey, how about a mic?  I'm hearing myself.  There you go.  No, we got it. We got it. We got it.  Am I on?  Yeah, I don't know which one is one or two  every single time.  I'm not hearing myself, but that's all right.  Who gives an F? 
[01:26:00]  Why would that be important?  You're on the air.  Your headphones aren't plugged in  properly or something.  I don't know.  But, you know, Steve's like,  well, I can't put you on.  And, you know, I said,  I'll get there real early,  which I understand.  He said 740,  and I'm like,  that's fine.  I'm going to get there  just to beat the rush hour traffic.  Yeah.  But he's like,  yeah, we have other guests.  And I'm thinking,  oh, there must be somebody famous  to promote a movie or something.  And I'm sitting in the green room  listening to Voss.  It's like, what the...  What is it?  One comic at a time? 
[01:26:30]  Until I get in?  We love Voss.  I do, too.  But I don't know.  He's not...  740, it's fucking...  Woo!  25 minutes after that.  Yeah.  I have to agree with Nick.  I have to agree with him.  About what?  Would I have broke the chemistry  if I came in five minutes early?  I mean...  Chemistry that is Voss.  Yeah, we're having a good time with Voss.  You're on Nick. 
[01:27:00]  What?  Oh, my God.  No.  It must be the holidays.  We had Voss scheduled,  and we were doing our thing,  and then we had you to the next.  No, I know.  What's the big deal, man?  I don't know.  Just like five in an hour.  At least put me on on time, no?  Well, we ended up doing  the Rich Voss celebrity bit.  Things happen.  What can I tell you?  I know.  How's your car, all right?  My car's all right.  I'll laugh my ass up on the way in.  All right.  At least we kept you entertained  while you're stuck in traffic. 
[01:27:30]  Sorry, buddy.  Where are you going to be, Nick?  Caroline's, January 1 through 4.  Oh, nice.  New Year's Day.  New Year's Day, Nick.  Yeah.  You're right, Rich.  Plenty of parking.  I'm burnt.  I'll rejuvenate.  Huh?  I'll rejuvenate.  I'm a little fried.  He was trying to make a joke of that,  by the way.  Who?  He didn't notice you.  He said, I'll rejuvenate.  You put the emphasis on Jew.  And then when asked what,  you said, I'll rejuvenate, 
[01:28:00]  knowing that you're joke-bombed.  Yeah.  What?  You look like you're 40 years old.  It's amazing.  Thank you.  I still can't believe you had a drug problem.  Major.  Yeah, but my insides were all screwed up.  Are they right?  Yeah, it was horrible.  His insides.  Yeah, it's just everything's falling apart inside.  It's horrible.  What the hell, man?  I feel like an old...  What happened?  An old Jew.  I don't know.  An old Jew.  But you look 10 years younger than you are.  You're like 55, right?  You're going to look great with your head on a satin pillow. 
[01:28:30]  People will love them.  They'll go, oh, look, you look so young.  Can you give yourself a crash on that one?  All righty.  I don't think you should be crashed on that.  Even if it wasn't funny, it still implies that you're dead and kicks us all over on  summer.  My career's been dead for three years, so my life is on the show, too.  That's ridiculous.  There was a story going really well.  The story went by in the...  You're at the tree fort.  What are you talking about?  I'm at the tree fort.  They should just change the name of the joint.  Who cares?  It sounds better than tree house.  You're going to take a secret oath to get in there?  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  It's a stash of Playboys up there to look at.  No girls in the tree house.  Three foot.  What were you saying?  I saw something on the ticker up there on the news about Michael Jackson.  Apparently, he's got some potentially fatal lung disease.  Let's keep our fingers crossed.  What?  Yeah.  Is that just hidden?  Yeah.  I didn't hear about that over the weekend.  Breathing in baby powder.  According to one of his biographers, they say he has this bad lung disease that's got 
[01:29:30]  him internally bleeding into his intestines.  Good.  Maybe get some color in his face.  Is that the same one that killed Barney Mack?  The same disease?  No.  That was sarcoidosis.  Oh, sarcoidosis.  That's a different thing.  That's my eighth grade math teacher.  Greek fag.  Can you say that?  I guess you can.  All right.  Where are we?  We got off track here.  Everyone all right?  Nick, you all right?  I'm fine.  You got stuck in traffic and didn't want to follow Voss and Voss agrees with you? 
[01:30:00]  What the hell happened here?  We're just trying to do a radio show.  All right.  Now I'm lost.  Oh, we got the tree man guy.  That's where we were going to go.  The guy with those stupid frigging feet and hands.  He's a disgusting thing.  Yeah.  There's some great videos up online of...  Has he still got the feet and hands?  I don't know.  I thought they cleaned him up.  Didn't they?  I thought they...  Yeah.  He gets croned every six months. 
[01:30:30]  It's...  How do you even describe this?  It looks like he's got just tree roots growing from his limbs.  His hands and feet are like just huge, out of control...  They're calling them warts.  I don't know what the hell that is.  It's from not washing.  Those aren't warts.  I have warts.  Genital?  Yeah.  It's like having your own tickler built in.  Oh, God.  Does this tree guy have problems with the other parts of his body, or is it just his hands and feet? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Grabbing them.  I would assume so.  Sure.  Yeah.  Like, it kind of goes up his arms.  He's being consumed by a fungus, it looks like.  It's really disgusting.  Now, wait a minute.  I saw the documentary, and they got it down to like a small shrub.  Now he's getting...  Well, that's...  Is it growing back?  Well, that's why we got the update today.  We thought we heard the last of Tree Arm Guy.  He's back.  He's back, yes.  Easier for him to sneak up on tigers.  Oh, what's that? 
[01:31:30]  Why don't you put headphones on so you can be with the radio show there, Rich?  What?  What was your...  You had a line.  No, just forget it.  Why?  You stopped the whole show.  No, what?  There was audio playing when you said that, so nobody heard your line.  Yeah.  It was the news story playing, and then you said that.  Oh, because I didn't have my earphones on.  Exactly.  So what'd you say?  I forget.  His earphones.  What?  We might have to do a take two.  I thought it was fun.  We might have to play commercials and come back.  Take two.  No, I said, he's your...  We heard you. 
[01:32:00]  You bitch.  All right, here's...  Justin Kushner.  Yeah, here's Tree Arm Guy.  Indonesia's wart-stricken man is finally undergoing treatment for his condition, but it's a long process with no ultimate cure.  Dede, also known as Tree Man, has been treated as a freak for most of his life due to the gnarled growth sprouting from his hands and feet.  Listen to her.  Doctors have found a way to help his condition. 
[01:32:30]  Surgery has already removed six kilograms.  A way to help his condition, and they pan to him and he's got a shotgun in his mouth.  I'm working a stage on his back this New Year's Eve.  Nothing on that one?  Nah, I wanted to enjoy it, but...  Maybe did I...  Was it too long?  Tree House, Tree Man.  Oh, okay.  Tree Four.  It's quite a leak there, Rich.  Yeah.  That's right.  It's kind of a tree joke, isn't it?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm just asking.  Yeah, it's a tree joke. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  He's the new logo for the club, this guy.  ...moved six kilograms of warts, but they started to grow back because of his low immunity.  Dr. Rahmat Dinata is involved in his treatment.  We've told him that his disease could not be 100% cured.  At the time, we only tried to increase his life's quality and help him lighten his anguish.  Dede was abandoned by his wife and is unable to work because he can't use his hands.  He's allergic to maples.  He drank...  His wife abandoned him. 
[01:33:30]  Allergic to Redwood.  He's just...  I'm leaving you for a man who doesn't have a tree growing from every limb.  Would you leave Bonnie if this happened to her?  If she gets one word on her face, I'm gone.  I'm not going anywhere.  He joined a freak show to earn some cash.  He's desperate for life to return to normal.  And they wanted to hand him cash, and they said, money doesn't grow on you. 
[01:34:00]  I have.  He's desperate for life to return to normal.  Doctors estimate that he'll need to have surgery at least twice a year to remove and reduce the warts.  Yeah, it's like proning.  Can't you just do it yourself?  Yeah, you'd probably learn how to do that yourself.  After a while, you're like, you know what, I'm not paying the bills.  Whatever it takes.  Yeah, just shave it down.  I love how...  Sorry, I'm so distracted by the governor of New York in Iraq. 
[01:34:30]  They're just showing him there.  He thinks he's in Montreal.  Yeah, I would so say, yeah, let's go to the mess hall and point him right toward the minefield.  Take bets.  Or play, let's leave the plunger in the latrine.  Fly him into Fallujah.  Tell him it's the base.  He's got an a la sucks t-shirt on. 
[01:35:00]  He could be the only guy to be heading video, not looking into the camera.  He's staring off beyond.  Good morning, the video.  You don't even have to blindfold him.  Yeah, why do blind people travel anywhere?  Like, why would he do that?  I don't know.  You could just, you know, talk to him by phone.  Right.  I know.  He might as well be in his living room.  Might as well be anywhere.  Let's see the sights.  Mark Wiener says.  Yeah.  Hear the sounds.  He goes with a tape recorder and plays it for people.  And this is what I heard when I was there.  I want to see his pictures from the trip. 
[01:35:30]  Like free shoes of pictures of his feet.  Doorknob, a cloud, a picture of a sink, a cloud.  Look, here's 30 with the lens cap on.  If I wasn't a blind fruit bat, this would have been a photo of a tank.  Or for two weeks he was taking photos with binoculars.  They look good, Governor.  Keep it up. 
[01:36:00]  Doing a great job.  Great job.  Wonderful.  Just sign this.  No, no, here.  Here.  Jesus.  He doesn't like the blind jokes, though, we learned.  Yeah.  He says he can take a joke, but.  Well, then.  He didn't like what SNL did with him.  Put sunglasses on.  Yeah.  Look at that.  That's sick.  Where'd he look at?  We ran out of racial jokes, so what's next?  What?  Nothing.  Tree Fort.  The Tree Fort.  The Tree Fort.  The Tree Fort New Year's Eve.  The Tree Fort.  I love that. 
[01:36:30]  This picture of us climbing up a rope to his kid.  To his gig.  Ah, yeah.  Oh, my.  Hick and stem.  All right.  So they got footage of the blind governor in Iraq.  And somebody's ex also over there.  Yes.  Look at that.  Oh, I thought so.  Wow.  Yeah.  Look at that ad.  They went and shipped Jill over there, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Is that Jill?  Have fun.  That's Jill.  Why is she wearing a coat?  Is it really?  Maybe it's a flak jacket.  It is a flak jacket.  Oh, it is?  She's wearing a flak jacket.  I heard Anthony was in the area. 
[01:37:00]  A flak jacket.  How appropriate.  They sent her to Iraq.  Elbow to the ribs.  I get it.  I dash R-A-C-K.  You didn't get it?  That is first.  Oh, all right.  That is good.  Well, I thought that just bombed, and I was going to make it bomb further.  That's very good.  Yeah, that's good.  Who's this guy?  That's Marvin Scott.  That's that English stand-up, isn't it?  That's that comic's father.  Steve Scott.  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  What?  Really?  We know his dad.  Yeah, Steve is a comedian.  Marvin Scott's been around forever.  They send her there just in case some of the uniforms get contaminated.  She knows how to burn them.  Put them in a ditch, put some gasoline on them.  I like the fact that Marvin Scott has his sleeves rolled up like the guy who brought  the Playboy bunnies in Apocalypse Now.  He's really bothering me.  That's how they should have brought her in like that.  She could have done a little dance on the cowboy outfit. 
[01:38:00]  That was great.  That was really good.  Speaking of the news, we got this really strange clip from Steve Bartlestein.  Steve Bartlestein used to be our favorite news guy.  Yeah, listen to this.  For John Rhodes, his wait seems like an eternity.  After traveling through a maze of canceled and delayed flights from Louisiana to Chicago  to New York, he missed his final flight to see his girlfriend in Toronto.  I'm doing the best I can with my family and the woman I love to try and get me a bus out of here. 
[01:38:30]  It's really no one's to buy.  But that's life and we'll get through it and we'll be together soon and that's all that matters.  Who was that?  Well, that's the setup.  The guy took a bunch of flights to try to see his girlfriend.  Last flight, I don't know, he couldn't get on it for whatever reason and now he's at the airport, stuck crying.  Was he crying?  So then they...  A little whiny at least.  And then they go back to the studio and this is where we get Steve Bartlestein.  I'm sorry.  He's just trying to make his wits. 
[01:39:00]  Come on, man up.  He's going to make it home.  His girlfriend's probably not as upset as he is.  People in the northern suburbs digging out this morning.  So am I.  Good for him, though.  He's right.  Man up.  He's like, man up.  Yeah, he really got up.  Hey, you wimp.  Jesus.  You can't be the guy crying on TV.  How about that?  No.  A girl.  Certainly wouldn't be Voss.  No.  I'm trying to make it to a gig.  I'd be crying if I had to go.  You're having a flight on time. 
[01:39:30]  You're falling your eyes up.  Go to Canada.  What's wrong with you?  Why are you crying, sir?  We're landing 20 minutes early.  Yeah, Voss isn't going to go to Canada for Christmas.  No, he's spending it with his first family.  His first family.  My older daughter.  It was okay.  I could talk back.  Yeah, but we were with you when you said that you had to stay home to do a gig, but then  we learned that you'll be spending Christmas with your ex-wife and your daughters.  Yeah.  That is weird.  It's not weird. 
[01:40:00]  Plus, my daughter got games.  I want to go to her games, you know.  How does her husband feel about you being around her?  That would weird me out.  Who cares about that?  That would be.  I mean, I'm going to be around forever.  I got kids with her.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  You got kids with somebody.  It doesn't mean like you go over there and start chum-chumming with your ex-wife.  Why can't you?  Why?  Why?  Because society says you got to be enemies with your ex-wife?  Society.  No.  I'm just curious.  It sounds like a very black Christmas.  Wait, do you guys hang around the same house opening gifts and stuff?  You and the...  No, me and my ex-wife lay in bed.  We open ours in the bed and reminisce. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, we sit around the house.  No, it's a little weird.  That's all.  So you hang out with her and her new husband?  I try.  Hopefully, he won't be there.  Where would he be?  He's going to be his ex's.  Yeah, it's Christmas.  He's actually going to be with his family.  Would you remarry your ex if you could?  No, no.  No.  What, are you kidding me?  You're like a bad holiday movie.  You're like one of those bad holiday movies that come out every year.  Meet the 12 parents.  Yeah.  Are you taking your girl to see Santa on Christmas? 
[01:41:00]  What?  Yes, that's what I'm doing.  Is your girl going to sit on Santa's lap at the mall for Christmas, Anthony?  Dressed like Santa.  But that's a fair question.  I'm just wondering, is the guy mine?  What are you getting for your girl for Christmas?  A new tattoo?  All right.  Shut up.  I know.  Oh, Rich is fighting back.  This is my favorite part of the show.  But he's had enough and he starts fighting back.  I like this.  Before you insult Anthony's nice girlfriend, I was just curious, how is her husband mine?  I'm not saying he shouldn't go.  I'm just wondering if he minds.  I've never sat and had a talk with him because I don't care. 
[01:41:30]  All right?  I have kids.  I moved two miles from my ex-wife to be by my kids.  It's not my fault they live in our house.  We understand you're a good father.  He's bringing up a good point.  Like this is your ex-wife and her new husband and you're at their house for Christmas.  Yeah, but it's got to be weird.  I'm not sure about going, honey, remember how we used to bang?  I don't talk.  But that's all like when?  But that's what Jimmy's saying.  That's all like. 
[01:42:00]  The ex-husband, the husband is thinking that.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like uncomfortable.  You're making his Christmas uncomfortable.  Yeah, it's all in the air.  Everyone understands like everyone's relationship in the room and that's why Jimmy's question  is very good.  It's got to be strange.  You banged her at least twice.  Supposedly.  When my daughter graduated, they had a party.  And my father's there.  You know, my father, me, Bonnie, and everybody and her family.  You know, it's.  I think it's terrific they all get along.  Why does it have to be such tension?  Yeah. 
[01:42:30]  I'm just hoping there's more tension.  Yeah.  Why?  Because I really just can't imagine you and the new husband.  It's like my finger.  Hanging.  Yeah.  Isn't it true your ex-wife also babysits your new kid?  Sometimes.  That is so weird.  There it is.  That's beautiful.  That is beautiful.  Yeah.  You know, and she has a cleaning service.  She used to do our house, too.  Your ex-wife cleaned your house.  Not anymore.  She quit.  Why?  Why'd she quit? 
[01:43:00]  Because I used to leave stuff around for her to see.  No.  She quit.  Why did she quit?  She has too many others.  That's not why she quit.  She probably saw all the nice stuff you bought, Bonnie, that you didn't buy her.  Her Amway business was skyrocketing.  Did Bonnie go, like, all of a sudden, there's itching powder in my tampons.  What's been going on?  She was quite sabotaging her stomach.  Why does he use tampons?  Well, it was a nice little joke, by the way.  Jesus.  What?  Can't you just go with the holiday spirit here?  The holiday spirit? 
[01:43:30]  What did you even say?  Nothing.  What's wrong now?  Nothing.  What the hell?  You just jumped up and said, ow.  And then he pulled on his groin area.  What's going on in your groin that you're saying, ow?  When you don't wash, they start to stick to your legs.  Oh, God.  How about washing?  You don't.  Listen, I get along with my ex-wife.  I get along with her husband.  He came up.  He, you know, sometimes, because he's very mechanical, so he'll come over.  He'll fix some of the stuff at my house.  Oh, that's good.  You know.  You have your ex-wife's new husband come over and do the stuff you can't do as a man. 
[01:44:00]  As a man.  Right.  As a man.  Look, I suck as a man when it comes to that stuff, but I, you know, hire somebody else.  They become indentured servants.  We're over.  My underwear was dirty, so her and her husband teamed up and washed it.  Jesus.  He gave it a good washing.  He's a good guy.  He's really a nice guy.  He's a good guy.  Look.  What does he do for a living?  He's like an ass system.  Huh?  What does he do for a living?  Works for me.  He, uh, computers.  He's a computer guy.  Oh.  He's a good guy.  He's a nice guy. 
[01:44:30]  Computer.  That's nice and vague.  What, he works at Best Buy selling laptops?  Yeah, he could be anything.  Rich, you do understand that, like, you're, it's weird.  Like, most people would never have a relationship with their ex like that.  Well, you know what?  To the point where she's babysitting your kid, uh, her new husband's coming over and fixing  stuff that you can't fix.  It's like Debbie Warren, Ashton Kushner.  Yeah.  They have that type of relationship with Bruce Willis.  Bruce Willis.  Bruce Willis.  Man, did, did Bruce Willis wreck that gene pool, by the way? 
[01:45:00]  Have you seen his daughters?  No.  Oh, my God.  They look like small men.  Pretty much.  They got the big, the big, they all have the big Bruce Willis chin and they're trying to,  and they're trying to say that, you know, these girls are hot like their mom.  It's like, no.  No.  It's right.  A lot of them look like Jay Leno.  Look.  Yeah, look at that head.  Wow.  If you cover up the chin and go just with the eyes, it's like, wow, that's a beautiful  girl.  Looks a lot like her mom.  A little face put on a big head.  She looks like Demi Dennis. 
[01:45:30]  Bruce wrecked it, man.  I think they had three daughters and they all look pretty much the same with these big  chins.  They got Demi's, Demi's face.  Beautiful eyes.  On Bruce Willis' big head.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that one.  Which one?  Oh, wow.  Stop.  What a disaster these kids are.  With just the really nice Demi Moore eyes, but.  Yeah, the rest of it.  Oof.  Yeah.  All right.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, this is a good question coming in from Spiro for Rich Voss.  Spiro, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Rich, I'm wondering, how much do you enjoy prepping the new husband?  Prepping?  Are you a cuck?  Are you prepping the bull, cuckold?  Yeah.  Are you prepping the bull?  Is that what you do around the tree?  Are you going to kneel in service?  Are you going to use your mouth to service?  Like, I bet you that the ex-wife writes messages on Voss's face and lipstick. 
[01:46:30]  You know, place unit here.  Oh, uh-huh.  Queer.  All right.  We got Rich playing the tree fort somewhere.  The tree house, Dan, during New Year's Eve.  New Year's Eve.  And Nick DiPaolo is January 1st or the 4th at Caroline's here in New York City.  Quick break, and we'll continue next.  Opie and Anthony.  I don't like that one.  No!  What?  Oh, that's one of Jimmy's faves.  Comes out on stage this one, I know. 
[01:47:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Full house today.  We got Nick DiPaolo, Caroline's, January 1st or the 4th.  And then Rich is playing the tree...  Tree house.  Tree house.  New Year's Eve.  New Year's Eve.  New Year's Eve.  New Year's Eve.  Yeah.  We also have Nick DiPaolo, Funny How.  New C-Dip.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  NickDip.com, you can get it.  How many copies do you bring in?  I don't know.  Like five?  I got five.  I am.  They're in my coat pocket.  All right, good.  I want to check that out.  Give this a listen on the way home.  Make my nice... 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, we're a big fan of...  Pleasant drive down the expressway home.  Real good holiday material.  You'll enjoy it.  We're a big fan of Nick.  He's screaming at the audience.  Good.  He was well on his way in radio, and then the rug was yanked from underneath him.  And now the whole business is imploding.  Oh, I know.  It's like, are you...  You know?  Now it's just unbelievable.  I'm serious in the world right now.  Yeah, well, what are you going to do?  We're just trying to hang on.  Shovel driveways, I guess.  It's a bunch of walking dead in suits that don't know when the axe is coming in to chop 
[01:48:00]  their heads off.  So they're just trying to stay under the radar.  So there's nothing new creatively happening.  There's no one willing to take a chance because then the boss will have to see the guy  and go, oh, what's your name?  Yeah.  Hey, could you fire that guy?  You know?  So...  Really?  So everyone's afraid to do anything except just try to hold on to their jobs.  That's all Hollywood.  There hasn't been anything new creatively in years because in Hollywood, no doesn't get  you fired.  If they take a chance and say yes, they can get fired. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  Then, you know.  Because they're just big...  You know, what do you call it?  VH1 passed on the Osbournes because none of them have a vision.  Yep.  None of them have a vision and they all try to do...  I just said it during break.  ABC is going to do a talking head show during prime time.  Okay?  People will get so sick of that band, too.  It's...  It's...  It's...  It's...  Hosted by...  It's ridiculous.  Hosted by what?  Who's hosting it?  Yeah.  I have...  It's a comic. 
[01:49:00]  I forget.  Some comic from Australia.  Some...  You know, they're bringing in...  Some...  I don't know.  Some comic from Australia.  I never heard of him, but he's supposed he's the biggest act in Australia or something.  You know.  Biggest act in Australia?  Voss is wearing rabbit fur today and I said he looks like an old queen.  Yeah, he really does.  Where'd you get that?  At Bloomingdale's?  Yeah, I got a phone.  My boyfriend...  At what store?  At Bloomingdale's.  He doesn't even want to play.  All right, I'll admit this.  We just started talking about how sad old queens are. 
[01:49:30]  It's awful.  Don't look at me when you say how sad old...  I'm not an old queen.  Sad old queen.  Okay.  Yeah.  What's wrong with some nice coat?  His ex-wife's husband fixed the zipper on it.  It's a true story.  Uh-huh.  That's how I got a deal on it.  The zipper was broken.  It's a fur sweat jacket, though.  What's that?  It's a sweat jacket.  You ever heard of that?  Listen, did that come on a skateboard?  Look at you.  This is a fur coat.  All right.  That was pretty funny.  It was funny. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Shut up.  Jimmy's wearing a kiss shirt with flames on it.  I know.  It's kind of tribal.  I'm just taking a bad tattoo.  Shut up.  Jimmy, you got some grays coming into the back?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I never saw it.  Those are moles that are just getting cancer.  Wow.  That's right.  Distinguished from the back.  Yeah, I look like a gentleman.  Yeah, I look like a gentleman from the back.  You look like a gentleman.  You know whose jacket that is?  The lady from Midnight Cowboy.  You were going to charge me for money?  For money?  Show your mouth. 
[01:50:30]  Rich, why are you trying to be so stylish all the time?  You're not stylish.  What's going on in your head that you need to be stylish?  You got to show people that there's a success or something?  Put the hood on for everybody.  Years ago.  Put the hood on.  60 cents.  I want you to have it.  Years ago, I worked with a major headliner who, years ago, was Rob Bartlett, years ago,  and he still is, and he said, dress for success.  Well, when is he kidding, right?  You're going to start dressing for success.  Are you going to have a tuxedo on at the tree foot? 
[01:51:00]  No.  No.  The last thing you should ever say is you got to dress like a million bucks to earn a million bucks,  and then a bullet should just tear through your forehead.  Did you just grab your shirt or your breasts?  What did you just grab?  What do you mean?  Oh, that was hurtful, Rich.  What's wrong with you?  I have cancer.  I have breasts.  I'm sorry.  We're all just trying to have fun.  What's wrong with you?  What's the matter with you?  That new cancer.  What do you do to you, man?  Yeah, could you put your hood up?  Yeah, please.  We want to see in your...  It's reversible, too.  Is it?  Oh, put it on the other way. 
[01:51:30]  So what?  It could be a pimp after noon?  Yeah, because the inside is all rabbit fur.  You've got to flip this thing.  I think it's reversible.  All right.  The zipper goes like that.  How about on my...  That's kind of a waste of rabbit fur.  Of course it is.  Oh, and it doesn't go down the sleeves?  Oh, my God.  No, I mean, it's a waste of rabbit fur because it looks like a regular, like, hoodie.  It makes it look like something a chick would wear.  It is something a chick would wear.  Like a rabbit fur, like, vest.  I don't wear it that way.  And then the sleeves are, like, leather.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:52:00]  You look like Sonny Bono ready to sing with Cher back in 68.  That's exactly what it is.  Yeah, that's the Sonny Bono.  They say, I love, man.  Don't pay their end.  Yeah.  Anthony feels like he's hunting now.  No, I don't hunt.  I shoot.  Put a model of hood.  Put the hood on, Rich.  Rich, let us see your rabbit fur hood.  Yeah, now run across the sawmill at midnight wearing that hood.  Oh, my God.  Where's Rich?  Look, it's a Jewish deer.  Rich, don't move. 
[01:52:30]  I'm trying to take a picture over here.  Yeah.  Over here, over here.  I'm too much.  Over here, you dope.  Turn that way.  It's a Jewish deer, a half a buck.  Yeah, half a buck.  I was kicking that around.  Oh, yeah.  I don't wear it out.  It's a nice coat.  It's warm.  Can I see your coat?  Yeah, I bet the rabbits were warm, too.  No, no.  You're going to burn it or do something.  There's no need to wear a rabbit fur.  I would never do that because you've spent a lot of money on it.  Furry's murder.  Don't make me.  There it goes in the garbage. 
[01:53:00]  Right in the garbage.  Spiked it.  It was a two-point dunk.  Not two seconds.  I'll be spiked Voss's jacket into the garbage.  That was right next to four years.  Oh, I couldn't even forget it.  Oh, I bet you it was a good one, too.  I was going to try it again.  No, forget it.  It's not going to work.  Now you get ketchup on your fur.  Yeah, I threw my breakfast away.  You've got to bring one of those.  What?  What?  A lint brush?  I know you're shedding like crazy.  Why don't you just have your wife do it for you? 
[01:53:30]  Ex-wife.  Does that coat come with ticks?  All right, I'm with Nick.  He should have been in here earlier.  Absolutely.  I was just trying to get something going when I came in.  It really didn't fly.  What were we thinking?  That's great.  All right.  I was supposed to be in an a-hole, but it's all good.  Is that the only jacket you're wearing today?  Yeah.  It's cold out.  It's cold out, man.  I drove you.  I didn't walk.  All right.  But what about...  We should have hopped. 
[01:54:00]  Sissy.  Rich wanted to show off his new jacket.  What about the walk we do out in the freezing cold?  Yeah, the block and a half.  It's a block and a half.  We're going to cross the Northwest Passage.  All right, Mr. I love the cold.  That's a good reference.  It's single digits there.  When I pass in the equator.  You really are as dumb as they come.  What are we traveling to?  Venus?  Mercury?  Good one. 
[01:54:30]  Unbelievable.  I hate your murder jacket.  You guys want to kill her?  Since when you become an animal rights activist, you eat meat.  Animal rights, not animal rights.  Jimmy don't eat meat.  Yeah, I do.  Obviously, you've never been into that peep room.  That's all you could do with that setup?  No, I couldn't get it.  That peep room?  You old lady?  I would have said, I didn't know cold is now considered meat.  When did you become such a flaming liberal?  I'm not a flaming liberal.  That you don't eat, that you're an animal rights activist.  I eat meat. 
[01:55:00]  You vote for Barack.  What happened to you?  I didn't vote.  And if the Republicans would have put up a better candidate, I would have loved him.  I didn't like who they put up.  I liked McCain.  I just thought he was too old.  I wanted Obama.  But I'm not a flaming liberal at all.  I don't like fur.  I wear leather.  I eat meat.  I'm not 100% consistent.  I just think fur is kind of stupid.  Why?  Because it's such...  Personally, I think it's such pomposity, and they murder them.  I've watched them.  I don't like to see anything skinned alive.  It just bugs me.  Whatever.  I'm not saying that...  I didn't watch your skinning.  I just bored it. 
[01:55:30]  Don't go to the treehouse on New Year's Eve.  I'm not flaming liberal at all.  I know that.  But you can't say, I don't want someone to wear fur as I'm wearing leather.  Yes, I can.  Yeah.  They're skinning cows alive to get the leather.  No, they're not.  Well, not a lot.  The difference is, one...  I'm not saying that leather's right.  I'm not saying it's right.  Ambien?  Yeah, exactly.  Or volunteer.  Take that off.  We're going to take it from you.  Take it off. 
[01:56:00]  Like, this is a zipper right under the header.  You know, I'm not saying it's 100% consistent, but, you know, to me, that's a little bit...  That's just such a display of liquid.  It's just stupid.  Yeah, you're going too far.  Rabbit, though.  Rabbit, they are abundant.  I mean, yeah.  It's not like...  I'm not saying they're extinct.  Rare, kind of...  I hope one of our listeners throws red paint on you.  That's a real nice thing to send them up for, you idiot.  Yeah, nice red paint all over that jacket.  If you say... 
[01:56:30]  If you say listeners, you should say, I hope our listeners...  How much is...  Okay.  Oh, damn.  That hurts.  That's hurtful.  I can't really defend that one.  Hey, Rich, how much does that jacket cost you?  For real.  For real.  Does it cost you how much?  How much?  Oh, 700.  I got it for, like, four or something.  All right.  I'll give $500 to the person that throws red paint on versus...  Okay.  Well, no, you jackass, you give me the 500.  Nope.  What's wrong with you?  You'll get nothing but a link to a PETA video where you can see them bludgeoning these animals 
[01:57:00]  and they're still blinking if their skin has been ripped off in a pile.  They don't really know.  That's true.  Remember that one.  We are just all...  I did one earlier, too.  I did one earlier.  We are all...  Not the one you guys heard when you were talking.  I heard that one, too.  Did you hear that one, too?  Yeah, and I was like, I think he said that.  I hope they caught it down the hall, but we have all just been driving the F-bomb.  We're on today.  We're ready to split and take a break from this.  It's amazing.  That's what it is. 
[01:57:30]  I dropped it.  I hope you got it.  I just honestly slipped out.  But Jiven's got to be on his mark today.  That's when you know there's good chemistry.  You cook.  You know.  It's all good.  I don't care.  It's very natural.  You just kind of, you know.  It happens when you get more than five guys in a room.  God forbid, huh?  Yeah, I know.  Steven S. from Bayshore is calling you Bugs Dummy.  I'm not saying that...  Look, you know what you want.  I'm not knocking it.  I just personally don't want to dress like Genghis Khan.  I mean, you do.  Yeah, if you want to kill cute little animals, go ahead. 
[01:58:00]  Or we'd have stopped you.  Yeah.  At least a cow.  Who gives a crap about a dumb cow?  Yeah.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  A rabbit?  How many rabbit feet did you have when you were a kid?  None.  Never.  Huh?  I don't want rabbit feet.  That was for like, you know.  You know, a rabbit foot for good luck.  Plus, back then we didn't see the videos.  You didn't know as much back then.  You just had a rabbit foot.  You thought they fell asleep and they took the foot off because they died in their sleep.  That's right.  You know what it is?  They died in their sleep with a purple foot?  So, I'm not willing to buy the whole PETA. 
[01:58:30]  Meat is murder!  Wow, that cow is still alive.  It's dangling there.  You know, of course, there are horrible things that happen.  I don't want to see the official PETA video.  The thing is, though, it's propaganda.  I know this crap is going on.  You're not seeing the other side that maybe, you know.  That's right.  Oh, wow.  A lot of these are not even in this country.  You're right.  You're right.  Absolutely right.  They do it in Russia and stuff.  Yeah, it's horrible.  What are you going to do?  They just showed you the dead rabbits.  They don't show you the cows that are spoiled.  They have nice houses and super cars. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, there it is.  What the hell was that?  That was an animal that's been skinned alive so some dummy can go back a little bit.  J-Lo can have a hat.  And they have to skin it alive so it doesn't...  I'll tell you how they kill it.  So it doesn't release, like...  Oh, that's gross.  What was it?  What was it?  It's probably a mate.  They grab it by the feet, they beat its head into the ground, and they cut around it while  it's unconscious or half-conscious.  They skin it alive.  They throw it into a pile.  That's what they do.  And then half of them are still alive until they just die with no skin. 
[01:59:30]  It's got a sting.  There's no need for it.  It's barbaric.  It stinks.  That is horrible.  What's wrong with killing them first?  All of that...  Still have the nice eyelashes, though.  Yeah, I don't understand.  They're skinned alive.  The animals become very cocky.  They kill them first.  This is the last thing.  You know what?  I have to agree with that.  It's horrible.  Thank God I got this on sale.  Look at the poor little guy in the trap.  That's got to hurt.  Maybe his cousins will learn.  People should watch this, though. 
[02:00:00]  It's like, that's what it is.  Ah, the old clubbing of the baby seals are always fun.  Yeah, but the seal is getting lippy.  Yeah, that one had it coming.  Yeah, the seal is talking during a movie.  Baby seals are very flippant around the holidays.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to open a bar and call it Baby Seals.  And then what?  People go, yeah, we're going clubbing at Baby Seals.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  That's right.  The tree fort, folks.  Tree fort.  Paid $40 to have puns thrown at you. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, really?  That's what's going to happen on stage.  It is kind of sad what they do.  Look at that.  Bleeding it out.  There's a lot of blood coming out of that cow.  Why are we watching this?  Guys, we're trying to show Voss how wrong it is to wear Ryan Seals.  But you know what?  That looks fake right there.  You know what?  Yeah, that wasn't real.  See, here's the thing.  Animal snuff films.  No, and here's the thing.  You can't say.  It's either you don't wear it or you do wear it.  Because you can't wear leather or you can't eat veal.  No, but you can say that.  No, you can't because either you're part of the problem or you're part of the solution. 
[02:01:00]  No, I'm not making a self-righteous claim.  I'm only saying that there's certain things to me that I feel are unnecessary.  I'm not.  Look, I eat meat.  I try not to wear leather jackets, but I do wear some leather.  All right, fine.  Oh, God.  That had a hurt.  Go back again.  But you're right.  It's these star-girl countries that don't know how to do it.  They are the ones that do it.  I think America's the guy.  That's a lie.  He's got his little feet off while he's still alive. 
[02:01:30]  He's still like the humans.  Because I need these feet.  I think you're mad because you paid a lot of money last night and he wore a lambskin  rubber.  That's probably why you're mad.  That wasn't that bad.  No.  Mom's just mad that you implied I want someone to wear a condom.  That's why you're mad.  What am I, all of a sudden a goody gumdrop?  A goody gumdrop.  Don't let that rumor get out.  Exactly.  My immune system can't stop it.  It don't deserve to be stopped.  Yeah, man. 
[02:02:00]  That's what they do.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  We're going to take another break.  A quick break, though.  And then we're going to come back.  We're going to do a little more.  And then we're going to go into the rock and roll for the New York station.  Yeah, a little rock and roll.  What's the new slogan here, Stump Brain?  That's where rock lives here.  It doesn't?  It also died here earlier.  I can say that.  I don't work with this dump.  Kiss my grits, you jerk-offs.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it, you stinky fags.  I can't say that anymore. 
[02:02:30]  I don't know the rules.  Who knows?  Who knows anymore?  Who knows?  It's right.  All right.  So I have a gig I want to plug if I could.  Just January 18th.  Wow, that was smooth, Jimmy.  Well, I know.  I think we're going to break.  And we've talked to Nick, and we've talked to the murderer.  So I want to hold on, Slaughterer.  We'll plug yours in a second.  I'm doing a third short, the Borgata.  It's January 18th.  Tickets are on sale now. 
[02:03:00]  And if you want to go, it's Martin Luther King's birthday.  So people are off that Monday.  That's a big weekend.  That is.  All right.  We'll do the other plugs after the break.  No, Nick's at Caroline's.  Caroline, January 1st through 4th.  And Funny How, new CD.  NickZip.com.  Nice.  Pick it up.  New CD.  Enjoy it.  And Rich, you'll be...  Got to get out of here in a few minutes. 
[02:03:30]  I know we can do real fast.  Where's Vaughn?  Vaughn, a raccoon up the street.  Give his daughter a hat.  He's got to bring in his bag.  That's a whole murdered animal collection.  Look at that bag.  Nick, have you seen this bag before?  We've argued this bag with him for years.  I can't see.  It's sold in the men's section of wherever, but it's a chick's bag.  It's a girl's bag. 
[02:04:00]  It's that Louis Vuitton, ain't it?  It's a Louis Vuitton, but guys don't walk around with Louis Vuitton bags.  That's a purse.  You're wearing a big purse and a rabbit-skinned coat.  All right, I'm going to come out of the closet.  You don't need to.  Or has it been blown off?  We just want to know where this comes from.  Why do you have to be so stylish?  What are you hiding?  Yeah.  Sorry, maybe I should get a high-water Long John t-shirt like yours.  Yeah.  I don't care.  Little brother shirt.  Look at you.  Look like you're wearing a little tight.  Are you going diving after this? 
[02:04:30]  I was trying for that not to hurt me, but I put it on this morning and realized it might  be a little tight.  Now I've got to cover up my boobs.  This is about you.  If Obi wants to set the dryer for nuclear, there's nothing wrong with that.  I can't argue.  I felt the same thing.  He's got a belly shirt on like Britney.  I've been pulling it down all morning.  It's not working.  Why?  Don't let him bully you.  You want to wear like a Long John Dickey? 
[02:05:00]  You wear it.  That's nobody's business.  You should be getting verbally abused by a guy with a purse.  I'm in trouble here.  I have a skin hood.  Why do I have to stand up?  I've been sitting the whole time because I knew it was a little short.  Body painting.  No, go ahead, Brenda Vaccaro.  What were you saying?  Brenda Vaccaro.  Looks like this shirt is on.  Brenda Vaccaro.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Where was the mic in her lungs in that commercial? 
[02:05:30]  I'm going to have to bring this shirt in for the staff tomorrow.  I'll give them all my hand-me-downs.  Brenda, I am Lungs Vaccaro.  So we have some pictures to show.  You want to do this real fast or a couple of them?  All right.  We're going to end today with some more name-to-celebrity with Rich Voss.  I'm not going to get any wrong this time because I don't have time for this crap.  All right.  These are news figures.  You're bugging me.  All these guys are in the news, okay?  I'm going to show a lot of the boys this one.  The giant that got in a lot of trouble recently. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Oh, Plaxico-Verse.  Barris.  What was his name?  Plaxico.  That's the job.  That's the bit.  See, the whole game is for you to come up with the name.  All right.  Not us to tell you.  Convict.  Plaxico-Verse.  You're right.  All right.  Plaxico-Verse.  You got the first one.  I don't care.  All right.  That's very good.  Plaxico-Theron.  We were just making fun of it.  If you don't get this one, this is the goof.  We're just throwing this in for fun.  It's our blind governor here in New York State.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:30]  Stop.  I live in Jersey.  Wow.  You don't know the name of our governor?  First of all, you grew up in the town.  Here's a hint for you, you dink.  You don't know the governor of New York, the blind governor?  You don't know his name?  DP.  Don Pardo.  Double.  Dolly Parton.  No, it's David.  David.  All right.  Nick gave you the best hint ever. 
[02:07:00]  I grew up in David Plainfield.  I grew up in Plainfield.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, the other neighborhood that you spent time with, and you got hooked on crack.  Oh, oh.  It's what you did when you saw a lady with a cute son.  David Baig.  Nice.  David, your son.  All right, this is the.  How about this scary guy?  This guy gives me the willies.  Yeah, he is really crazy. 
[02:07:30]  The governor of Illinois is in a lot of trouble.  Yeah.  What's his name?  You get this right, and I'll buy your rabbit boots.  You get this right, I'll pay your mortgage for a year.  All right.  I'll give you the money to get the first name right.  Jimmy, give him a hint.  R.L. is the initial.  That's right.  A lot of trouble.  What is that?  You know who's up on, what do you call it?  Who's facing 25 years?  Ed Rodriguez.  Yeah, I know.  25.  For what?  Stock scam with National Lampoon. 
[02:08:00]  That's good.  Do I know?  Yikes.  I just did radio for 10 people out there.  That's brilliant.  Go ahead.  I don't know his name.  Rob.  Oh, Rob.  Rob.  Rod.  Rod.  La Gah.  Love.  Oh.  La Boa.  La Boa.  God, I wish I knew this.  I would have got my mortgage.  I'll pay it.  No problem.  You're going to pay my mortgage?  If you get this name, you spent $20 on a shirt.  If you get this name, you've got a lot of witnesses.  Oh, oh.  Bovavich.  What? 
[02:08:30]  Bovavich.  Bovavich?  Bozavich.  Bozavich.  Bozavich.  You got Bozavich.  Bozavich.  No, no, write it down.  Don't phonetically spell it.  Write it down.  Let Rich read it.  All right, let's...  Wow, I was way off.  All right, look.  I'll even show you his name.  But now the mortgage thing is done.  Sorry, because now there's too many hands.  How about breakfast?  All right, I'll give you breakfast.  Right after the show, I'll buy you breakfast.  Mike, you ready?  Doing a little hard.  Oh.  I'm showing him the name, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:09:00]  This guy's a strange one, man.  He is a...  The worst hair ever.  Bladjivich.  What?  Where'd you get the G from?  Just there.  Did he get it?  Bladjivich.  I have no idea.  All right, good.  Can you say it?  Yeah.  What is it?  I'm not telling you.  Oh, really?  All right, now we're going with this guy.  Oh.  It's not Castro, but he was a...  Johnny Depp. 
[02:09:30]  No, it's not Castro.  No.  That's great, and he has six billion more taxes.  What's his first name?  I got this.  Shea.  The Revolutionary.  I know.  What's his first name?  I said his first name, the Revolutionary.  I'm just...  I'm...  What I'm doing is trying to help the audience along so they can understand him.  His name is Shea.  Shea.  Shea.  Oh, Chavez.  His last name is Stadium.  Chavez.  Chavez.  Chavez. 
[02:10:00]  Chavez what?  Chavez.  Chavez.  Give you a hint.  He's a strong middle from New Jersey.  The tree.  Delaina.  The tree hut, honey.  Shea.  The answer?  Pari.  You're already messing up.  Stadium?  No.  Oh, that was already said.  Who said that?  Listen to the replay.  Oh, I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it.  I love when that happens.  Oh, do I love it.  Oh, boy.  Shea what?  Stadium?  I don't know.  No, no, no.  Chavez. 
[02:10:30]  Chavez.  Oh, you said Chavez?  Chavez.  Yeah, I should.  You're wrong again.  What is it?  Let's take it here.  Oh.  All right.  We have Carl's brother.  We have...  Oh.  He's a hero.  We got...  He's a murderer.  The Russian dude.  You know what?  You know what?  Stu Kamens.  The Russian dude.  Is he the president officially, right?  I don't think he's now.  What is he now?  Now he's going to be head of the Communist Party.  He's a marionette.  He's a marionette.  He's a marionette.  I have no idea.  VP or his initials?  VP. 
[02:11:00]  Vladimir Putin.  Vladimir Putin.  Okay.  Putin.  All right.  Was that right?  Yes.  Pretty close.  Does that pay my electric bill?  No.  This one you should get.  He, you know...  Oh.  There you go.  The investor that...  Ripped off what?  Ripped off charities.  Ripped off charities.  Or something.  A lot of charities.  The Olympic Committee.  Every bunch.  Synagogues.  And he's not in jail.  He's not in Rikers Island.  I know.  It's scumbag.  It really is.  House arrest in his penthouse.  Yeah.  Moll off.  And it's freezing out, so who cares?  It's the perfect place to be. 
[02:11:30]  Who wants to be outside anyway?  I actually like guys who have the balls to stick guns in people.  I have more respect for those people than this guy.  Yeah.  This guy.  Seriously.  $60 billion, right?  Yeah.  He ripped off people.  Rich, he had the name.  Moll off.  What?  Moll off.  Yep.  That's it.  Say it again.  Moll off.  Something Moll off.  Moll off.  Moll off.  Moll off.  Or Madoff.  Madoff.  That's Kevin Moll off.  And finally, the Jewish guy in his 70s.  Finally, before we wrap up, the president of Iraq.  Oh, Iran. 
[02:12:00]  Iran.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Even he has a tough time pronouncing his own name.  Just hand it to him in the paper.  Let's see if you can read it off the paper.  I'll even...  This is for breakfast.  Oh, my God.  This is for breakfast.  No, this is for your mortgage.  I'm handing you the name.  This is for your mortgage.  That rip was an Opie shirt.  All right.  For your mortgage.  I get it.  My shirt's nice.  Mohammed.  I'm with you.  Ahmadinejad.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Whoa.  Wait a minute.  Whoa.  Wait a minute. 
[02:12:30]  You got the tough part right, you dumbbell, and you messed up the first name.  Mahmoud.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Yeah.  Wow.  You went on Earth.  So you get no more.  You went squirrel earmuffs.  Exactly.  I'll give you two fly mittens.  Voss has to know his enemies.  Wow.  That's very good.  I'm looking at him.  With that, Rich Voss is going to be at the tree house.  Yes.  And at Uncle Vinny's this weekend.  Next weekend.  I thought you were an Iranian spiritual leader. 
[02:13:00]  Wait.  Ayatollah No Brainy.  You stuttered and stammered through that.  I know.  That's a mediocre joke.  Wow.  Wow.  We're an out-of-town?  No brain.  Crocodile Rock.  What is that?  A theater or a big rock club?  It's a rock club.  Yeah.  That's it.  Who are you working with?  Me and Lenny Marcus.  New Year's Eve.  Nice guy.  I like Lenny.  That's a final guy.  And finally, Nick DePaul, before we get out of here and go to the other joint. 
[02:13:30]  Caroline's January 1st to the 4th.  NickDip.com.  And the new CD.  Funny How at NickDip.com.  Perfect.  Here in New York.  Thank you, fellas.  Here in New York.  Sorry for coming in here in a bad mood.  That don't matter.  Yeah, we're all in bad moods.  I apologize.  Screw it.  We're all dropping the F-bomb.  What a day.  Oh, my God.  I had a fight with Voss's wife before I left my house.  All right.  With that, here in New York, they're going to continue with some rock and roll.  It's where it lives. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, it lives here, I guess.  Apparently so.  And we're off to the other joint.  So no commercials.  Right into the rock and roll here in New York.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right.  We continue.  At least we got that going for us.  We continue.  We have a full house.  We got Rich Voss.  We got Nick DiPaolo.  And we got you listening.  Second to last show of the year.  Thank God.  You know.  Time to take a little break and regroup. 
[02:14:30]  Yes, Rich.  Nothing.  I was just talking about Nick.  He really puts a good fucking perspective on things.  He really.  What do you mean?  It's just because it's right to the fucking point.  It's just.  I'm not kissing.  I'm just saying it's.  You got to agree with him a lot of times.  But explain why you're saying that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We were talking movies and stuff.  He's talking about Heenan and.  We sat around for about 10 minutes just talking movies.  I know I've never asked for a pen before.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  Why should you?  I've never mentioned that.  Oh, the pen.  Oh.  Yeah, we'll be watching.  The pen.  Why would anybody put a pen?  No, right.  Well, fucking.  Pen is like.  Hey, can you please quit coming in here and making Jews look bad?  What, David?  Jesus.  Oh, David.  He should be on every fucking supremacist target.  Whatever.  What?  Supremacist?  Target?  Wait, whatever.  Supremacist?  Target?  Board?  You know what I'm saying.  The fucking way they shoot at him. 
[02:15:30]  You know.  I'm just.  Why?  He's a nice boy.  He's a nice boy.  He's.  He's what the fucking world sees as Jews.  Wow.  That really bothers you.  Yeah.  You're right.  You're right.  Because.  You know what the world sees as retarded.  So what?  It's not true.  That's true.  All right.  Do you want him to see Jews like you with tattoos?  Yes.  Yeah.  Because real Jews.  Not liberal.  Sellout.  Fucking.  How do you know he's liberal?  Self-hating.  Speaking of Jews, did you see the movie Defiance?  That was actually pretty good.  No.  I mean, I like the kid.  He's a good kid. 
[02:16:00]  He's a hard worker.  He's a good movie that you'd like.  David on the air.  The very average action.  I don't know.  This might be too far.  And self-hating.  You have more self-hation than everybody else know.  No.  That's just personal.  That's not religious.  Just the fact that you're really upset about this.  David looks like somebody.  Yeah.  Natterman.  A young Chernoff.  What does he look like?  Yeah.  David.  Well, how do you feel about it?  We don't like him.  What does he look like?  I do like you personally.  But.  Do you?  But.  You got to do something.  You got to toughen up.  You got to get a rabbit coat.  You got to get.  Here's what you got to do.  I forgot your Louis Vuitton bag. 
[02:16:30]  Jesus Christ.  Here's what I'm thinking.  Because you're.  You're not.  You're not completely a mess.  Contact lenses.  Okay.  Part your hair down the middle.  Down the middle?  No one has to part the hair down the middle.  Get some bell bottoms.  Hang out at the limelight.  Hello. 
[02:17:00]  David.  I'm with David.  I mean fucking.  You don't look like Ted Koppel.  It's your business.  Ted Koppel.  Rich.  Where are you going with this?  Rich is like.  This is a juke thing.  Rich is like.  And this is Nightline.  Rich is like the successful black guy.  Who has his family.  The wife and kids.  And has to look at the news.  And see like thugs.  Just fucking it up for him.  That's what you're like.  You're a Jewish guy.  You don't like spreading your Judaism around. 
[02:17:30]  And you see him as like Uber Jew.  Walking around.  Being that stereotype.  That people look at and go.  That's the problem.  He's a hip hop guy.  And he's Bill Cosby.  Right.  That's it.  It's not that.  He kind of.  And there's nothing.  It's not about you.  It reminds me of like upper west side Jews.  Like you could be on stage.  And say you trash Arabs.  And then you get Jews that go.  Oh.  Oh.  You know what?  They're the fuck.  They're the enemy.  And what it is.  It's just the liberal passive Jews that bother me.  It's almost to the point where you make me defend liberals. 
[02:18:00]  Because it's got nothing to do with him.  He's just a guy with glasses.  No.  He's a nice guy.  But he's not as smart as he is.  No offense.  No.  He just reminded me.  When I look at him.  I'm calling a time out.  I got to let the listeners know what happened here.  We decided.  We didn't decide.  Rich decided to just grab the ball and run with it.  I'm sorry.  But the problem is he ran right to the sidelines and out of bounds.  What are you doing?  We don't know what you're talking about.  We have no idea what you're getting at here.  I'm having a breakdown.  That's not a Jewish running down.  I'm having a breakdown.  That's not a Jewish football play it does.  He runs out of bounds. 
[02:18:30]  I'm having a breakdown.  I'm sorry.  Like we all take the ball and try to get something going on.  When did that happen?  Rich grabs it and runs right out of bounds.  What the plane crash?  Looks like everyone lived.  Jimmy, that's your favorite airline.  It looks like Liza Minnelli taking a nap.  Look, except for this kid.  Enough with this couple.  This kid banged his head at his coach.  Now he's speaking Spanish and shit in his pants.  I hate this couple.  That's the fat bitch that said that she was standing in the aisle waiting for her husband.  Look at him.  People were sliding down her to get out of the plane. 
[02:19:00]  She's probably the reason they crashed.  She stood up and the fucking plane couldn't take off.  So why would her standing up make a difference?  Because I didn't have a good joke and I realized I was running into a brick wall.  So I fucking quickly painted like a little pass-through.  She got heavier as she stood up?  Thank God, because I was bombing again and you covered it up.  I was going from bomb to second explosion.  And you at least counted a good line.  Diverted me.  Thank you.  Dave, I'm sorry.  Yeah, why are you attacking David?  I'm sorry.  It had nothing to do with you.  You should defend this kid. 
[02:19:30]  He's a nice kid.  It's okay.  I don't even...  It had nothing to do with you.  You should defend the commercials he's going to get because he looks like he does.  Seriously.  I know.  That's why I told him.  I would like to sign him.  I would like to fucking go in the mail.  Make a trillion dollars.  This kid, he's like the next Dell kid or something.  You should be defending him against people who are fucking with him.  I know.  I do.  No, you're attacking him.  All right, Rich, give the ball back.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  We're going to try something else now.  It was the pre-game.  That's all.  If you want to grab the matzo ball and run with us.  Really?  Wow.  Did you just say matzo ball?  And an E dash yuck. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  We were going to do this today, actually.  Listen to this.  It's Insertion Monday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Whoa.  Ouch.  Holy moly.  He should never do production.  It's so bad.  Well, it's not bad when he does it.  No?  Although, let me apologize to Voss for my earlier criticism of you attacking Davis. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he's terrible.  Yeah, we got in trouble Friday.  What happened?  I missed this.  What happened?  So now we've got to meet about it today or something.  Well, there were shenanigans and hijinks going on that usually go on on this program.  And some people don't understand, I think.  We'll have to discuss this later.  But my perception of the whole thing is certain people.  Are we going to get in trouble for even just talking about it?  I have no idea.  That we're in trouble.  I don't know.  But this is part of it. 
[02:21:00]  The part of our show that people need to understand is that it's an open forum.  That if there's arguments or things that are going on, it's brought out on the air.  So when people in management get upset about something we're doing on the show and we discuss it on the air, it's not to be taken like we're sitting in a meeting.  This is on the air and that's how it works.  Right.  That's how our show has always worked.  You reveal warts and all.  Yes.  That's what makes it what it is. 
[02:21:30]  Exactly.  Now, I'm sitting here.  I heard you got in trouble.  And this is satellite radio.  I was here when you had a retarded girl stripping.  I was thinking, what did they do to get in trouble?  Yeah.  I mean, you had a retarded girl stripping.  What could you have done that was worse than that?  You performed an abortion live on the air?  What do you know?  That would have been nice.  I'm in deep trouble because I got frustrated and walked off the show.  And I guess that can't happen, I heard, over the weekend.  You can't walk off an edgy show because you're upset.  Can you say you were acting and something really came up?  No.  I just wanted to look at you.  Mr. Famisham. 
[02:22:00]  But that's the thing is.  Well, I'm in trouble and now we have to talk about it today because I walked off a show.  Tackin' tackin'.  Well, the key is this.  An edgy show like the opening show.  The key is that we continue and finish up the show.  So that's, if somebody has a meltdown, we all have them from time to time.  Of course.  The fuckin' show will continue for the rest of the day.  There's days where Ant is not feeling well and doesn't come in.  Or obviously, if I'm gone, they get another comic.  And so it's like...  We all cover for each other.  Yeah, fuckin' relax, everybody.  As best we can.  Exactly.  What happened? 
[02:22:30]  I don't sweat it.  We're trying to do some insertion bits.  And that's what got you in trouble?  There was...  Stock and Patty was here.  There's a law.  No insertion bits.  Yeah, Stock and Patty was here.  And we wanted to try out some...  That would be another problem.  Insertion bits on it?  Some anal beads.  Wanted Patty to try out some anal beads.  Right.  She wasn't biting.  She wasn't going to go for it anyway.  Well, then try putting it on her ass.  Yeah.  Oh, is that where those go?  Well, folks, if you want the answer, they work.  Exactly.  And the fact is, it wasn't even anal beads, really.  It was just six bowling balls with a chain in between. 
[02:23:00]  And there was plenty of room to spare.  Oof.  And we were trying to coax her into putting those up her rectum.  And we got the phone calls.  And you can't do that on radio anymore?  Then we got the phone calls.  What the fuck's going on in this world?  I know.  On Saturday radio, you can't do that.  That's crazy.  Then we got the phone calls and stuff.  And instead...  See, what management doesn't seem to understand sometimes is that when they call up and say, 
[02:23:30]  no, you can't do that, we can't then just go on the air.  I'll tear down a little wall for some of the people.  We can't just go on the air and go, all right, we can't do that.  And then stop what we were doing.  And go into something else.  We have to address the situation.  We have to address it.  We have to talk to management about it.  Yell at them a little bit because it's always, you know, it's us against them.  It has been for 14 years.  If someone's familiar with the fucking show, for 14 years, we've been doing the same act. 
[02:24:00]  And hence...  I'm bored with it already.  Yeah, so is rich.  Did these bees have a crucifix at the end of them?  No, we were hoping to.  What a great idea, though.  Holy crap, I'm writing that down.  You mean these bleeds?  Come on, the outtakes on Smoke and the Bandit.  I thought it was the holidays and stuff.  It was a religious bandit.  Oh, a cannibal run, right?  Yeah.  I don't know what it was.  Does management listen to...  It was.  It was actually the outtake portion of the cannibal run with Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. 
[02:24:30]  I don't know who this man is.  Tell him you don't want to hear that joke again.  He'll understand, believe me.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  There we go.  That put me right where I needed to be.  Holy shit.  Where's this guy?  Reporting from the bottom of a lobster tank.  He's a fucking red-faced asshole.  Jesus Christ.  Really?  How cold is he?  Oh, my God.  He's supposed to turn blue, not pink.  Here it is.  It looks like a newborn baby's head.  It's a reddish blue.  Why are we all talking at the same time? 
[02:25:00]  What happened between the two shows?  Because this is the male version of The View.  Right.  Whoopi Goldberg's the dumbest human on the planet.  All right.  She's good looking, though.  Love her.  So, just...  Beautiful.  Imagine banging that.  No.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me just fuck a defensive back from the Eagles.  It's like a quick crack.  Why the Eagles?  I don't know.  So, just to sum up, we now have to meet about the shenanigans that went on.  And who do you meet with?  Can I call this guy and say hello?  We're meeting with people that don't understand our show yet. 
[02:25:30]  We have to...  Oh, new guy?  I'll keep an open mind and hope that maybe they get it.  Well, that's what it is.  It's one of those situations where we have...  Is it Phil Mushnick?  Mushnick.  Mushnick.  It's one of those situations where we have to discuss and hopefully end up with an understanding  where I think they understand the dynamic of this program a little better.  Are they new to the program?  Aye.  They've been here a while.  It's very difficult. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, like I'm pushing you to a clown.  They're new to this show.  They...  Oh, they do?  Yeah, they're a little newer to this show.  I think that the impression we have, because Sirius took over, is whether they say it or  not, Opie and Anthony's show is still kind of like the fucking...  In a weird way, like the creeps across the street.  Yeah.  And we haven't worked closely with him yet, so I still think there's a weird perception  about the show.  Oh, okay.  And a weird, like...  Like, for him not to understand...  I like Steve, but for him not to understand that kind of certain things have to happen  on the air.  Yes.  It's like when he's talking to our Steve through BlackBerry, and we're like, what's going on? 
[02:26:30]  And he just kind of hangs up on Steve.  It's like, no, man.  Part of it is the conflict we're dealing with, and part of it is that you can't just bail out.  It's like we're doing a live bit on the air.  Now, I'll use an example of someone that used to get it, and I'm not just throwing a name  around at someone's face, but yeah, Eric Logan, ELO.  He got how this worked.  There were times where he was genuinely pissed or something, but he knew that that's how this  show works. 
[02:27:00]  So that's what we did.  If they don't want that, well, then we got to talk about it.  But that's just what we've been doing for that long, and I would think, I would hope that  people would be familiar enough with the program to know that when they hear it, and not get  exactly.  It's just good radio.  That's it.  Isn't there a big way to go?  It's called working in the moment.  Isn't there like a head guy over Sirius that used to work with you guys at NW?  No, there's not.  His name is James Sirius.  No, you know what I'm talking about?  James Sirius. 
[02:27:30]  That's who he is.  Goddamn, Nick.  That's very good.  That's who he is.  You know what I'm talking about?  He used to work with you guys at NW, the skinny guy.  Oh, Jeremy Coleman.  No, no.  He was a skinny guy.  Skinny guy that ran NW, Jeremy Coleman.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, why are you saying no, no, no?  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it.  I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  Robert Reed?  Yeah.  You know him.  I'm skinny.  Yes.  He looked like a pussy willow, ironically, at the end of his life.  So we don't have to talk about it all day. 
[02:28:00]  Trust me.  But it amazes me we have to meet about this or have a conference call about this crap.  It amazes me.  I hope they're going to discuss why we haven't been paid in three months.  Hold on.  Let's save that.  And let's save that for later.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's save that for later.  Let me ask you about this payment schedule. 
[02:28:30]  Wow.  I just don't let it go.  You haven't been paid?  What's going on?  Well, let's.  What's going on?  I mean, Christ, you guys put in fucking.  I already.  If we're going to discuss stuff, we'll discuss stuff today.  I already hit the button once on that one.  All right.  We'll discuss stuff today.  We'll discuss that and other things.  Dan Curry, wouldn't you?  No.  You know what?  I'm going to change for you.  Oh, God.  I looked up at the top thing.  It was literally a thing.  She's not that bad.  Who is she?  She's got pretty eyes.  A little auburn hair. 
[02:29:00]  It's Marsha Mason.  They're all kind of morphing into one looking fucking being, though.  All these news chicks.  Have you seen me?  Look at her.  Her hair is a little metal.  Look at her.  She has fucked hair.  She stepped over your skull in the park.  She has fucked hair on CNBC.  They get the little picture of that little girl.  Have you seen me?  Have you seen me?  I would have sex with Diane Sawyer before Ann Curry.  You've had something for Diane Sawyer for a while.  Diane Sawyer is 63 years old today, too. 
[02:29:30]  63.  Really?  If she looks anything like she does on TV, yes, I would.  You still look squirt.  I can't say anything.  I see that.  I put cornstarch on my snatch.  I would have to say, yes, I would.  Because of your friction.  Fuck that dry catchment.  It's so fucking disgusting, man.  I rub my cunt with linseed oil.  That's why I was just a ming coil.  Yeah, some kind of weird old person oil.  Murphy's an elephant.  She has to put her hips and pussy under a mattress if you want to fuck her the next time. 
[02:30:00]  Ties it.  Yeah, she ties her legs together.  Her vag is drooping out like fucking butterfly wings.  Nice pussy, cadaver.  Fucking awful.  Looks like a bad boy in the teeth.  She's playing feather ball with that fucking...  Oh, God.  Her pussy is awful.  Excuse me, miss.  I think a hand glider flew into your vagina.  A meaty hand glider.  How about that bitch that just had her 18th kid?  That fucking broad. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just had her 18th kid.  They got a reality show coming up or something.  Oh, yeah.  I know who you mean.  Her cunt has a dog door on her.  I know.  Jesus.  They're just dropping out as she's walking to work.  Fucking 18 kids.  Her vagina's in a red wagon.  She pulls behind her.  Megyn Kelly's pretty hot, though.  No.  Yeah, she's lovely.  There's something a little masculine looking about her.  Actually, let me take that.  Can't figure it out.  Her eyes are a little too far apart.  I've seen the person.  They're pretty good looking. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, she's sexy, though, man.  She has kind of a runny, tough face.  Not bad.  I like her tie.  Her forehead's pushed forward a little bit.  I don't like that.  She's got the nose of an Irish cop.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  Aw, she's cute.  She's very cute.  She's aight.  She's aight.  You gotta go over there.  It's like fucking, it's like the Playboy mansion over there.  Yeah.  Fox?  Oh, my fucking god.  Really?  God.  Crazy.  Kind of off news chicks these days.  I'm fucking moving.  That one hot chick, Greg Gutfeld.  What the fuck?  What the fuck? 
[02:31:30]  We're gonna have discussions.  All I'm saying is if they're upset with us, well, then let's have some talks.  That's why Bob Eatman is gonna be involved.  I heard my love.  So all the issues can be covered.  Whatever issues need be covered, they will be covered.  I had a really bad week, so what can I tell you?  What are you talking about?  There was a few things that happened last week that made us upset, and we'll talk today. 
[02:32:00]  How about this?  And then maybe you guys will understand the show a little bit more, hopefully.  How about this?  Yes, James Norton?  I wanted to cover some more news stories.  No!  What about?  I do, too.  What about this?  How about McCartney turning into an old woman?  How about we do this?  How about we take a break and we'll regroup?  And I got a surprise for Rich Voss when we get back.  It is your day, Rich.  I hold in my hand.  Should I say it before the break?  Yes.  I don't even know what it is. 
[02:32:30]  Is it a cone skin cap?  We're coming to the end of the year.  Yeah.  I hold in my hand Rich Voss's Bombs and Flubs for 2008.  All right!  Wow!  On stage or here?  Here.  Here.  We got Bombs and Flubs.  The capacity on the DVD is only so much.  All from Rich Voss.  And we'll take a look at Jimmy for approval.  Anytime!  I get an F.  Teach?  Yo, teach! 
[02:33:00]  Here, stand and deliver.  You pump me up, give me a C at least.  I want to see that new Banderas movie where he teaches the tough kids the tango.  I saw it already.  That's an old new movie.  It's awful, isn't it?  No, I thought it was pretty good.  Was it?  For real?  No.  No.  All right, listen.  It would be good if he teaches them to tango and they cut his throat and raped his dance  partner.  And they fucked his face while he bled out.  While he bled out.  There you go, take this, Zorro.  Take a shot right in the gullet.  They carved gang signs into her fucking clit and tits. 
[02:33:30]  Holy shit.  Fucking tango.  Holy shit.  Hey, I'm going to learn to tango in my lips.  Yeah!  Hoo-ah!  Imagine making a movie where you're teaching the kids a tango.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  How do they really get their finger on the pulse of America, huh?  They're all rebellious at first, but then he says something and inspires them.  It's turning out garbage.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Stop.  Yeah.  It's such a phony would never, ever fucking happen in real life, ever.  You've got to see these movies that are all nominated. 
[02:34:00]  It's fucking sad.  Keep sending them to me.  We'll do that after break.  We're going into a regroup here.  I think I'm buying more.  From car stock.  Thank you, sir.  Good question.  Food is here.  Perfect timing.  Beautiful.  Thank you, Kenny.  Holy shit.  Look at Kenny.  When we get back.  Wyatt.  Five scoops of ziti.  Wow.  We're going to break.  All right.  When we get back, Rich Voss, bombs and flugs for 2008. 
[02:34:30]  Almost 1800 and night.  Opie and Anthony.  Rich Voss playing the treehouse.  New Year's Eve.  New Year's Eve.  Where's that?  Is it Danbury?  Danbury?  Yes, it's not far from the city.  It's the top of a Redwood.  Danbury.  Danbury, Connecticut.  Uncle Vinny's this weekend, I think.  No, not this weekend.  Yeah, whatever.  All right.  Right on.  Good plug.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Rich, you got to be...  Whatever.  What are you doing?  Plug happily.  I am.  I like that guy. 
[02:35:00]  He's a good guy, man.  You want to plug happily?  Here's what you do.  Hey, good news, ladies and germs.  I got a show at the Borgata, a little place in Atlantic City.  Go there and you go there in a $90,000 car.  You come home and we're like, fuck that up in a real expensive bus or something.  And it's January 18th, the night before MLK's B-Day.  After that plug, people are giving back their tickets.  Why would they do that?  Because...  The plug sucks.  Yeah.  No.  Sorry. 
[02:35:30]  We can't all have good plugs.  No.  Actually, it's a very good plug.  Thank you.  Let's see if Nick can do a better job.  You can get that one.  Hey, if you're doing nothing...  Nick will do a better job.  What better way to get rid of that New Year's Eve hangover than spend it with me January 1st,  through the 4th at Caroline's Comedy Club.  January 1 through 4.  That's right.  Thursday through Sunday, folks.  You can get tickets at mcdip.com and pick up my new CD, Funny How. 
[02:36:00]  Listen to that one on the way home.  Yeah, listen to that in your car on the way home.  Especially if you have little kids, if you like the word twatzone.  Caroline's is good.  The first week of January.  It's always packed.  Yeah, Caroline's is a fun place.  I had someone throw a glass at me four years ago, so come on out.  Memories.  It's fucking beautiful.  Good old memories.  All right.  Rich Voss, Bombs and Flubs for 2008.  This is your big day, Rich.  I think we can do other stuff first.  No, we'll do this first.  It's like the year-end review. 
[02:36:30]  They love you.  Yeah, Rich.  There was a couple funny lines this year.  All right, we can play Name the Celebrity again.  No, no, go to Bombs and Flubs.  Go to Bombs and Flubs.  I'm going to give you one.  Arnold Hitler?  We're going to show him this one.  Oh, I know.  That's easy.  That's easy.  All right.  John Malkovich.  Cool?  Malkovich.  John Malkovich.  Yeah.  John Malkovich.  I slur a little sometimes.  I didn't notice it.  If you didn't say anything, I would have never known you.  Spit all over me.  How about it? 
[02:37:00]  Kathy Lee.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Here's another.  I'm going to try to get you another easy one.  Oh.  Kiefer Sutherland.  Kiefer Sutherland.  Sitting next to Voss is like sitting at the red seats at SeaWorld.  You know those?  The ones that are like, all right.  Your own risk right here.  And that whale comes out of the water.  First two rows of the tree hut.  They're going to have Gallagher plastic.  All right.  I forget his.  Give me his first name.  I'll tell you his second one.  Lisa. 
[02:37:30]  Oh.  Paul.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Strapping.  Giovanni.  Right around it.  Paul Giovanni.  Giovanni.  All right.  Wait.  You're close.  Giovanni.  Giovanni.  One more try.  The Gia part's right.  Paul Giovanni.  Monty.  Monty.  Giovanni.  All right.  Fail.  Just fail.  How about this one? 
[02:38:00]  Oh.  That fucking guy.  He was in that show with Dice.  Right.  I'll give you a hint.  That's a.  What's his first name?  Serrano's got the disc.  Serrano's got the disc.  Is that Vince?  Yeah.  Dennis.  Oh, Dennis.  Oh.  Yeah.  Dennis.  So far no good, right?  He's the one.  Dennis.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Farina.  Dennis Farina.  Did he change his name?  Dennis Farina.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  You would know.  Then what is it?  Dennis Farina.  All right.  I told you. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, Harvey Kitell.  All right.  Wow.  He's nice now.  See, I told you the old ones I know.  Bit over.  New one.  Oh.  She just, she's got her hanky on eBay right now.  This is.  See, that's when I blew her nose on Leno.  Yeah.  This is what, right now, one of the hottest chicks in Hollywood.  I have a photo with her.  Yeah.  Shut it.  Do you?  Of her.  I see.  What's her first name?  I'll tell you in a second.  I know her.  I met her at the.  Robert.  Kelly.  Scarlet.  Scarlet.  Oh.  Oh, it's O'Hanson. 
[02:39:00]  Met her to Woody Allen.  I was going to say O'Hara.  Those are the.  Those are the.  So far.  Chief O'Hara.  Guarantees.  Yeah.  Chief O'Hara.  All right, Batman.  Fuck my big juicy tits.  Come in my face like that Canadian.  Who is he?  Chief O'Hara.  What a racist fucking character that was.  Chief O'Hara, holy shit, I forgot about that guy.  Everyone remembers Commissioner Gordon.  He's got to be dead for a hundred years.  I remember Chief O'Hara, big fat Mick.  He would just walk in every day and go, toodly-doo, drunk, or eat potatoes and beat me wife, drunk. 
[02:39:30]  It's like great fucking police force you got.  You need a superhero every day because you're too fucking tanked to do your job and command  your police force.  That's hilarious.  Well, it was Commissioner Gordon and Officer Justin Volpe and Batman would have to fly  in and remove the plunger from Haitian heinies before the media got wind of it.  And then Robin would smell them in the Batcave.  That's what they were doing.  And Alfred would come in and scold him.  Young, young Master Robin, stop licking the evidence. 
[02:40:00]  That's not an ice pudding pop.  You big cocked fruit.  You fucking double underwear wearing faggot.  Master Robin.  Master.  Yes.  Wow, no, that Kathy Lee Gifford is a beast.  You found feces on the red phone.  She's a beast.  Yeah, it is.  Nick, would you?  Ooh.  Kathy.  Fuck yeah.  Only if Frank was watching in his diaper.  I'd go there, I think.  Look at her neck, though.  She's put on a little meat.  She doesn't work.  Yeah.  What if they do to her neck?  That's my bit, Rich.  If I hear you doing it on stage, I'll kick you. 
[02:40:30]  First of all, it's obvious.  I'm looking at her neck going.  I know.  I'm just saying.  So she's fucking...  Sorry, Captain Obvious.  I want to get rehired.  Captain Obvious.  How many other fucking necks?  Brand new insults.  I know.  We're just saying.  I don't know.  Rich, how many other Nick DiPaolo bits do you do?  17.  17.  He's got a chunk in a Louis Vuitton bag that I used to do.  Yeah.  Can I tell you something, Ant?  Yes.  What's going on today is we're distracted because we have the big conference call at 5 o'clock today. 
[02:41:00]  I see.  If there was an issue, we probably should have discussed this on Friday.  Yeah.  Or over the weekend.  But people don't really understand how we work or our show yet.  So I'm sorry that they don't know that yet.  Are these guys new?  I don't understand.  You're new to our show.  Oh, they are?  Okay.  Yeah.  We've got a big distraction because it came down, I think, late Saturday that we were  going to have this huge conference call today at 5 o'clock.  Saturday.  So it kind of puts you in a little bit of a distraction. 
[02:41:30]  Over the phone, we're going to yell back.  What the hell is that, Rick?  What are you doing, Rick?  Just dropping shit.  You want to know why his computer's broken at home?  Yeah.  Just drop everything.  You want to do a...  Get the nervous system of fucking...  Somebody pick a fucking...  Stephen Hawking.  I don't know.  Fucking...  Hey, I did that bit on stage.  Michael J. Fox.  I do the Stephen Hawking thing.  Yes, you fucking move like him.  Yeah.  Who's Stephen Hawking?  What is he known for?  He's brilliant.  He's the guy in the wheelchair that fucking indents everything.  Stephen Hawking.  He sells a lot of things. 
[02:42:00]  He invents everything.  What?  What is he?  I don't know.  He's like the computer guy.  What did he invent?  What did he invent?  Yeah, he invented that paddle thing you do with the...  I don't know who the fuck he is.  Name one thing he invented.  Name a wheelchair that invented things.  Rick, who's that up there on the right?  That's the governor.  What's his name?  Bonavich.  All right.  What did Stephen Hawking invent?  What did he invent?  He invented snow ties for his chair.  Hello.  What did he invent?  He's a physicist.  He invented a drool-resistant necktie. 
[02:42:30]  What's his expertise?  Shitting his pants and not combing his hair.  That's right.  Well, he can say, help me in four different languages.  And clicks his teeth twice to say hello, three times to say goodbye.  Holy shit.  And four times to say the black orderly has been fucking my face.  Can you replace him? 
[02:43:00]  What's his expertise, Rich?  His index finger.  He can write a book with his tongue.  His index finger?  Let's move on.  All right.  We're going to do bobs and flubs.  Starring Rich Voss.  The year-end edition.  We'll start with this one.  Rich has no idea what we're talking about and decides to jump in anyway.  Has now been arrested?  A hundred and something times. 
[02:43:30]  Milestone.  Is it how many times he's been arrested?  Yes.  Or what?  Four.  Oh, okay.  It's a milestone.  I will say 1,000 times.  That would be impossible.  I'm sticking with it.  That's impossible.  Because I don't care if I win or not.  I'm going to go with 1,000.  How can you go with 1,000?  1,000.  That's insane.  I'm saying 1,000.  It's not enough days.  It would be arrested 1,000 times.  I read this story, and I can't remember if it's 100 or 1,000, but it's one of those.  I'm saying 1,000.  A hundred is easy.  Foul support. 
[02:44:00]  Holy moron.  He's thinking about what Bonnie's going to ask for when she leaves him.  You weren't listening.  Wow.  What?  Yeah, you just blurted that out.  Yeah, that was kind of a...  I kind of remember that one.  Another bomb from Rich.  Rich tells what Colin is eating.  Colin Quinn.  What?  What?  He has some egg whites.  What are you doing?  Trying to help Colin.  Much of my friend hurt himself.  What is he eating?  What is he eating?  Or an apple turnover. 
[02:44:30]  I haven't decided yet.  Fifth and sixth grade.  What the fuck does that mean?  He suffered back then.  I think you meant he was covering up childhood things.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's a good line.  It's not a good line.  Yeah, that's a good line.  You're right.  It's not a good line if the question is, well, what comes after fourth grade?  No, it's a good line.  It's never a good line.  Yes, yes, because he's burying feelings.  I got it.  So it was a great line.  It was a terrible line, even though I got it.  It was like, what's he eating?  You should have said something that covered in memory.  He's not fifth and sixth grade.  It was too vague. 
[02:45:00]  It was not like he was eating dressed up.  It's too obscure.  It makes you think.  No, it's like, what do you swallow is different because you swallow that.  You don't eat your anger.  Excuse me.  Guys that are getting paid are talking now.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, God, that'll be you.  What do you think?  I get a check when certain other people don't?  What fucking illusion are you under?  That's strong, Rich.  Another bomb from Rich Voss. 
[02:45:30]  Why would Colin climb a tree?  We find out.  What did you want to play?  Well, it's just that it's on the same CD, and it's one of our favorites, the Screaming  Tree People.  Oh, yeah.  Have you heard of this one, Colin?  The Screaming Trees?  Yes.  You did hear his one?  Not the band.  No, not the band.  No, I did hear you guys heard it.  Colin climbs one.  Here's the thing.  Why would I?  I don't know.  Do you think this thing's through?  What are you doing?  Here's the thing. 
[02:46:00]  A lot of this is coming from one day.  That might have been a bad day.  Second of all, this tree is screaming because Colin, at the time, was a little big.  Well, it could have been ten minutes ago.  He's still fat.  I'm not going to attack it.  Wow.  Oh, God.  So, we're about to play the bomb of the year from you.  We get where you're going.  Yeah, no one didn't get it, Rich.  I think the fifth and sixth grade one is really good, though.  We know you do.  Oh, God.  He's still on that one?  Yeah.  You know what was a good bit?  Woody Allen's bit on how his father worked at Coney Island, and Woody could never knock 
[02:46:30]  over the milk bottles.  That was a good bit.  And then the tidal wave came, did about a million dollars worth of damage, and the only thing  left standing were those little milk bottles.  That's a good bit.  That's a good bit.  What was Colin eating?  Fifth and sixth grade is the blurted out remark of an idiot.  And I love you.  You know I love you very much.  Listen.  But that was a terrible line.  I have terrible lines all the time.  It's part of life. 
[02:47:00]  This is uncomfortable for everybody.  No, Scott.  Everybody's fine with it.  I love it.  It's all good.  Yeah.  I'm just watching the clock.  Got to make sure I stay until 11 o'clock so I don't get in trouble.  Nah.  Here is possibly the bomb of the year from you, Rich Voss.  Wow.  How's that muffin?  Can I have a bite?  I'm so hungry.  Do you really think I'm going to fall for that so you can smash it?  Here.  Looks like a period soaked up in it.  What is it?  That's great.  What's on top there?  That's exactly what it is.  What do you order a heavy day corn muffin? 
[02:47:30]  That's his last tampon.  I'm sorry.  I'm stepping all over each other.  Let's just trot upon each other.  Can I get a heavy day corn muffin?  Okay.  That's good.  And why would you say you think I'm going to fall for that?  Yeah, I do.  You gave me your coat and it ended up in the garbage pile you got.  That was today, Rich.  Did you have to...  Because you think I'm going to fall for that.  You fell for it an hour ago.  Well, did it cost extra for them to cut the string off that muffin?  Get it?  Bloody cut joke.  Number three. 
[02:48:00]  I figured Anson Nix did well.  I would jump in and make a bloody cunt joke about your fucking rotten, clotted muffin.  I hate your clotted muffin.  That fucking muffin should be laying on...  It's like laying a giant ass polyp.  Fucking Jacqueline Kennedy should be trying to pick half of that muffin up off the back of a fucking limo.  Oh, shit.  Get it?  I like a corn muffin.  Muffin should be...  It's a corn muffin with an exit wound. 
[02:48:30]  It should be on the bathroom floor.  Yeah.  With children's furniture out by the curb.  Oh, a brand new one.  Fucking folded up.  It still smells new.  It still has those little packing peanuts that flex on the outside of it.  The pain that's taken down that little mobile.  I know.  Just rip it down.  The pain comes out.  Sheetrock comes out of the ceiling.  So angry. 
[02:49:00]  It was funny.  Take a break.  This could be rough.  Sighed by the curb.  We were trying to get a chick to lactate.  Yeah.  At least another five minutes.  Oh, no.  At least.  At least.  We're terrible.  This is gross.  I'm out of here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm offended.  Can we play the rough?  But the bright side is you have a new office that nobody will want to go in.  No.  You can almost see the unicorns through the paint. 
[02:49:30]  Trying to do your paperwork.  You just stare up.  See stars and angels.  Maybe we should have got rid of the dolphin curtains before I moved my desk in.  Dolphin curtains.  Oh, shit.  God, this is just fucking ruthless, man.  Woo.  All right.  Sorry.  Where were we?  Fifth and sixth grade.  All right.  Fifth and sixth grade. 
[02:50:00]  It was terrible.  Rich, you got a third ear on your head, I should know about.  Fucking headphones are.  Oh, he always wears them like a fucking one is up on his hat.  It hurts my ear this year.  Oh.  Cancer.  What ailment is that?  Possibly the bottom of the year from Rich Voss.  Here it goes.  You just start looking and going, I got to get out of here.  There's going to be traffic.  Tank explodes in Massachusetts. 
[02:50:30]  Is it mass?  My dad drives an auto-trike in Massachusetts.  Wow.  You told me about a strike.  That wasn't it.  I have never heard silence like that.  And I've been in the woods camping.  Fucking by myself in fucking Maine.  Holy shit.  Here's the thing.  What?  The line after that got fucking line of the day.  You cut it off right there. 
[02:51:00]  It's called deceiving.  It's called bombs and flubs with Rich Voss, you idiot.  Are they taking you out of context?  Yes, they are.  Oh, look at them.  They're fucking liberals.  What was it?  Liberals.  Yeah.  They're liberals.  Washington's over and punched Anthony's muffin.  He punched my sandwich.  No, it's a panini.  But it's fine.  He made it a panini.  Exactly.  He actually broke his little turtle finger hands on the sandwich. 
[02:51:30]  Rich just planted his fist in Anthony's sandwich.  It did no damage.  Of course it did.  What the fuck is wrong with you, Rich?  It left like a cat paw print.  Yeah, there's like nothing wrong with this sandwich.  I could be a fucking...  I could be a marionette and a puppet hand coming down.  I've done more damage than that.  I didn't want to really hurt it.  It's like a bird stepped on it with three little fingers.  It's fucking awful.  It bounced right back, that sandwich.  I know.  It's pretty amazing.  Perfect.  You'd never know.  That sandwich was just punched.  No.  Only Voss can break his hand on a club sandwich. 
[02:52:00]  A weakling?  Yes.  Voss took four rounds to knock out the turkey sandwich.  Straight right hand to the tomato.  All right.  That was cute.  We're going to do flubs now with Rich Voss.  I thought we were done.  You straight out of the year.  That was the bombs of the bombs and flubs.  You ought to sell these on your website, Rich.  Yeah.  This could be fun.  We'll give this disc to you.  You put it up on your website.  Here we go.  Rich tells everyone where you can buy his DVD.  Rich Voss, DVD, Amazon.com.  This is a good place to leave it. 
[02:52:30]  It's Amazon.com.  Did you just say Amazon.com?  Amazon.  That's where you should go for Voss's DVD.  Amazon.com.  Amazon.  Well, why don't you look at that website?  What?  That's where my DVD is.  It's at Amazon.  That's where it is.  You said Zot.  Amazon.com.  He's trying to act, and his whole face goes limp.  It's like you have Bell's Palsy when you fucking act.  You can't fib. 
[02:53:00]  You can't.  You can't tell a fib.  You can't.  I like how your whole face goes like this.  You're just very sorry.  Like you're trying to ventriloquism.  He's trying to lie about a date rape.  It's like you're going to struggle.  Here's a wonderful flub from Rich Voss.  Listen to this one.  We'll see.  Great minds think a lot.  I like.  Oh, my God.  Great minds think a lot.  Completely correct.  It's actually true what he said. 
[02:53:30]  They do think a lot, great minds.  Wow.  His trip to England is my favorite line.  Hopefully we have that.  Hey, holding up the whole elevator.  And the whole elevator is just like wilted with misery.  He put his hand in so it opens.  I go, thank you for holding us all up.  I'm glad someone said it.  Yeah.  All right.  The world evolves around you.  There was a packed elevator ready to go to the floors.  All right.  Please tell me.  What?  That I'm not the only one that heard the world evolves around you. 
[02:54:00]  I said revolves.  You did, but without an R.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  Yes.  I remember that one.  I'm like Archie Bunker, man.  The world evolves around you.  The world doesn't evolve around you, huh?  That's right.  I mean.  Eat it there.  The world evolves.  It's just great.  That's brilliant.  You could feel when the scaffold was cutting across your stomach.  The what, Rich? 
[02:54:30]  The scaffold was cutting across your stomach.  Was there a scaffold cutting across your stomach?  I love Jimmy.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  There was a sheet hanging up so you couldn't see.  You couldn't see, but you could see.  So they kept looking over the top of it.  Hold on.  So they took the scaffold, though, and where did they cut?  What do you mean?  Well, the father of your daughter just said that a scaffold was used to cut you.  He was on a building on the side.  Yeah.  It's funny.  A scaffold.  Put that in the room. 
[02:55:00]  Scaffold.  Oh, my God.  Everybody knows it's a scaffold.  Who delivers a baby?  Two painters?  Wow.  A what, Rich?  A scaffold.  Everybody knows that.  Maybe I was just daydreaming.  A scaffold?  A scaffold.  That's what cuts you.  A scaffold.  A scaffold?  By the way, this is live.  This isn't another one of the flubs that we're playing.  Tomorrow's our last day of the year.  Yeah.  A scaffold.  You're saying scapple now?  Yes.  All right.  Cool.  Scapple. 
[02:55:30]  Scapple?  Hey, are you not religious because you hate to go into chowples?  Oh, my God.  Scapple.  Do you like scrapple?  Do you eat scrapple?  I should have got a favorite iced tea.  Yeah.  Scapple.  Scapple.  Scapple.  Scapple.  Scapple.  I love Indian savages when they would scapp people.  Scapple.  Scapple.  I hope the surgeons sanitize that scapple.  Scapple. 
[02:56:00]  What's it called?  Scapple iced tea.  Oh, snapple.  Yeah.  All right.  We got the next one.  Rich tells Danny.  Let's move on.  You rule, Rich.  Rich tells Danny to get another tattoo.  Bombs and flubs with Rich Voss for 2008.  Hey.  So you're saying that the Nazis, they were the ones that set the bar?  Yeah.  That's what we do.  But see, Rich, I live in a time and day where they have electric cars and the Internet,  so I don't have to worry about some people throwing me on a train to Auschwitz.  I'm like, I don't ever have to worry about that.  He's taking the Nazi fucking definition of a Jew. 
[02:56:30]  I know.  And that's what it is.  Get some more Star David tattoos.  Yeah.  Okay.  Get some gargile ones.  You saw a book for me.  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  Wear them with your diamonds.  Argoil socks.  That's what it sucks.  What's that?  Gargile sweater.  Gargile.  Whatever.  Get some more gargile. 
[02:57:00]  Gargile.  And Anthony's line got lost in the laughter.  Anthony says, what do you wear?  Argoil socks.  Argoil socks.  Oh, my gosh.  Gargile.  Gargile.  He just blurts this shit out without even blinking.  A gargile.  Gargile.  See, we love you, Rich.  We put this whole thing together for you today, knowing you were going to be in.  Yeah.  We got one more.  A tribute. 
[02:57:30]  You're a fine catalyst to this radio show.  There's been some really fucking strong moments.  We got to put that together.  That's boring.  Who wants to hear that?  That's true.  Who wants to hear the silliness?  And these are all strong moments, by the way.  They're fucking hilarious.  Gargile is very funny.  Yeah, but I didn't do that on purpose.  I know.  If you did, it wouldn't be funny.  You're being funny.  Not trying.  That's why we call them flubs, you dummy.  Exactly.  Not trying.  That's the whole thing.  The whole thing is called bombs and flubs. 
[02:58:00]  Not trying.  Yeah, Rich was.  Not trying.  Let it be known.  You're very funny on the stage.  And very funny on the radio, just in a different way on the radio.  Thank you.  You're in complete control on a comedy stage.  Complete, my friend.  I missed this one.  A famous tenor was not at Opie's wedding.  I don't know what this is.  Oh.  Is this a good one?  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Is this good?  Yeah, it's fucking, of course it is.  All right.  The lovely Lindsay was as beautiful as everyone thought she would be in her wedding dress.  Isn't that ridiculous when she came walking in? 
[02:58:30]  It's like, wow, that's how a bride should look.  Yeah, yeah, it's like that.  That's how a bride should look, not with razor stubble.  Hi, Daddy.  I guess it was.  Do you want me to be a bride this evening?  I guess it was a secret when it came to Pavarotti.  Pavarotti?  What's it?  Pavarotti.  You know, it's mere moments after the show started.  Mere moments.  I've never had any around me.  What does that even mean?  I don't know what he was even going for.  Pavarotti?  Yeah, yeah.  I know the guys just hate the picture. 
[02:59:00]  He was trying to say Pavarotti.  Yeah, he was trying to say Pavarotti.  Why don't they just call them photographers?  Pavarotti.  The Pavarotti.  There's always a tenor snapping your picture.  Oh!  He's singing in your face as he snaps away.  Say cheese!  Please!  Brad Pitt, look this way!  The Pavarotti wasn't at your wedding.  Oh, my God.  Rich, I'm giving this to you. 
[02:59:30]  Maybe you put it on a CD or something.  Yeah, you should.  Hidden track.  Hidden tracks.  That'd be good.  Old school.  Hidden tracks, right?  There you go.  Merry Christmas, by the way.  This is all you're getting.  Now my CD's going to reach 17 minutes.  That's all you're getting.  I got a new one coming out.  Rich Voss, heaven sent.  Wonderful.  I am.  Yeah, that guy Coke Logic is doing the cover.  Big deal.  Sorry.  Listen, we're going to do German nursing service caters to gay elderly. 
[03:00:00]  After the break.  Oh, my God.  A quick break.  Those Germans.  Yes.  How could it?  What, do they serve the food out of a bedpan bag?  God damn it.  He's horrendous at that.  But Craig, for...  See you later, person we can't mention.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony show.  Had a nice little visit.  Yeah, that was nice.  Happens around the holidays. 
[03:00:30]  You get the...  Christmas visit.  You get a little homecoming action.  Red jacket like Santa.  I was very happy to see you.  All right.  What are we doing here?  Bang.  He didn't leave, did he?  That was the biggest smashing I ever took was from Roland.  Something in the water today?  Why?  What happened?  What happened?  We were like...  Well, to his credit, he doesn't really get...  Anything.  He doesn't understand anything.  Anything.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Isn't it possible? 
[03:01:00]  See, there are certain people that aren't really supposed to be around.  Yeah.  All right.  You weren't supposed to be around.  Yeah, you put them on that.  That's why I said person we can't mention.  Yeah, that's usually a clue.  But we did say person we can't mention.  Usually a clue.  And, Ann, why don't you tell everyone the observation you saw during the break with my...  With the intern.  Oh, God damn.  What's that intern's name?  Is that Joe?  I think it's Joe.  He's a good guy.  He's a fan.  If you're a fan, you can become an intern. 
[03:01:30]  That's how it works.  But holy mother of God, a little observation might have helped.  Joe, did you realize what you did?  At all?  Did you realize what you did?  That was so silly.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, walk...  Just do me this favor.  Just tell everyone what you did.  You walked in and did what?  Don't explain anything.  Just tell them.  Oh, just because I heard you on the air saying you were hungry-ass if you want anything to eat.  All right.  So during the break, he comes running and he goes, Ope, are you hungry?  He's like, need anything to eat?  Ope, you hungry?  And he's standing right, very close to Ope. 
[03:02:00]  Ope's sitting there.  He goes, Ope, are you hungry?  Do you want something to eat?  Ope couldn't answer him because his mouth was full and he was eating.  The second I got the last word out, I saw it.  He had, and it wasn't like a little snack to tide him over until he gets something to eat.  It was a huge sandwich.  It was a breakfast sandwich.  It was a breakfast sandwich.  He's eating it.  It was in my right hand and my mouth couldn't have been fuller.  I'm laughing.  I'm going, he's asking me if he's hungry and Ope can't answer because he's eating. 
[03:02:30]  We got to go on my birthday.  I wish that was on the air.  Oh, it was perfect.  I wish that was on the air.  I was like, how do you say that?  Yeah.  Quiet.  I'm trying to hit this story about green nightclubs.  Oh, great.  What the fuck is that about?  What, I got to recycle my date rate pills?  What the fuck is going on in this world?  Fucking green nightclubs.  Should I turn down the sound system?  I'm going to save.  Noise pollution.  Jesus fucking Christ. 
[03:03:00]  I can't breathe in noise.  Shut up.  It goes away the second you shut the shit off.  It's not pollution.  I fucking hated that always.  It's noise pollution.  It's damaging to what?  Click.  It's off.  The air's clear.  It's not like fucking coal pumping out of smokestacks in the 30s.  Noise pollution.  All right.  Hippie bastards.  You're tomers on my eardrums.  Let's learn about the old gays and what happens to the old gays.  Ah, the old gays.  They get married, their wife goes to Canada, and they stay with their ex-wife. 
[03:03:30]  In rabbit coats.  Oh, it's awful.  Fruit.  You're not dying, Rich.  You're killing everyone around you.  Do we have any pain?  They die under a bridge.  Do we have any pain in their office?  They die under a coat, and they weigh 11 pounds, bleeding from their assholes, as pigeons  peck at their fucking festering sores.  That conjures up quite an image.  The pigeon pecking at you rotted nuts.  Pigeon's got shit on his beak. 
[03:04:00]  Pigeon's a pigeon could enjoy some sarcoma.  It looks tasty.  We're not saying you're an old queen who's going to die of AIDS.  Are you talking to me?  Yes!  No!  He was talking about just gay people.  I'm talking about you.  We're calling you gay, Rich.  Yeah, with your fucking rabbit jacket. 
[03:04:30]  Look at that thing hanging on.  If that, look, that hanging on the back of the chair, you would absolutely go, which girl  does this belong to?  If you wrote a note to him to come get my jacket from behind me, probably.  I did not, Rich.  No, I would never have blown it by pointing out your jacket on the back of that chair.  Don't ever underestimate his stupidity.  Yes, please.  The Mystery of Jesus, tonight at five on CNN.  No mystery.  He's going to be exposed. 
[03:05:00]  So that'll be an objective support.  Oh.  Oh, what are you doing?  Good one.  Did you just shit into the microphone?  Pretty much might as well.  Oh, you dropped an aerial right on that mic.  An aerial.  This thing absorbs it, too, like a fucking set of underwear.  Wow.  Oh, shit into the mic.  That could be a bad one.  All right, let's get into the German nursing service.  The gayest and the gay elderly. 
[03:05:30]  You all right, Rich?  Perfectly fine.  Oh, Rich.  With his rabbit coat on his lap now.  Yeah.  I flew into Miami, and I saw the golf course that we had that fine.  Dural.  We played Dural, thanks to UFC.  Yes, we did.  And I'll be playing.  What?  Was the Statue of Liberty freezing to death?  It's just funny.  Because it's not working.  What the fuck?  Who?  What?  New York kids, Coke drug.  Get the.  Hey, I gave away a Coke this year. 
[03:06:00]  Jesus fucking Christ.  If you don't have a Coke during the winter, you don't deserve one.  How about that?  Hey, Rich, why don't you get the Statue of Liberty of your Coke, because I look right  on it.  You're so stupid, you can't fucking go into a movie theater and steal it off the back  of somebody's seat.  You're a fucking jooch.  You'd rather freeze to death than fucking.  You didn't think about putting.  I learned that from Midnight Cowboy, by the way.  That is a good one.  Remember Rico Ratso?  Yeah, Rico Ratso.  He's making you paranoid, you dummy.  You stole this.  Don't even think about it.  A little bit, Coke.  He's making you paranoid.  All right. 
[03:06:30]  Your fucking Coke has rabies.  Exactly.  All right.  Well, there's little little rabbit duties in the pocket.  It's really.  It's made out of rabbit assholes.  That's how they got it so cheap.  It's the hair on the rabbit assholes.  You got Lyme tick disease from the hood.  Why are you protecting your coat, you weirdo?  They take the rabbit assholes out with a conductor's punch.  They make one jacket out of them.  There's no pimps around here.  There's so much going on.  They don't even have to kill the rabbits with those jackets.  They just pull their assholes out.  They just stun them.  Asshole hair.  That's wonderful. 
[03:07:00]  Asshole.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What is wrong with you?  What, are you going to wipe your ass with a rabbit fur?  I should.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Come back over here.  He's hiding his coat.  A faggy fucking coat.  That's a terrific coat.  Like roadkill with a zipper.  Looks like Maury's wig.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Oh, no.  What up?  Oh, shit.  Oh, he just got up. 
[03:07:30]  What is up?  Yeah, I gave him a big jar of fucking tomatoes.  Oh, you wouldn't do that, would you?  Oh, wow.  Good lag.  I used to be a bartender.  That could have gone right off the end.  Is he really going to do that?  I have no idea.  I don't think he would, but you never know.  You ever try to get rag goo out of a squirrel?  You actually...  Rich now has put his rabbit jacket in a plastic garbage bag. 
[03:08:00]  Just don't throw it this way.  Where it belongs.  That jacket is found in an appropriate home.  Yeah, really?  He could get in with it.  All right, we're going to go do this.  Bunch of fucking children.  How do you fucking...  This show is amazing.  Austin, you show you got a jar of sauce out of nowhere.  What kind of magicians are you, people?  Yeah, we're all like them.  I eat a pound of portobello mushrooms.  Oh, no. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  How are you going to distract him when he comes to sit down?  Yeah.  Somebody go, Rich.  No, no, no.  Something shiny.  Yeah, something shiny.  There we go.  I've got the bell on my whistle.  All right, listen.  That's what I...  Where'd you get there?  I don't know.  I'm going to get my wife one for Christmas.  Somebody.  When my prick goes down.  Yeah.  You need a good sound effect when you can't get a rock.  Yeah.  Sorry, honey. 
[03:09:00]  Sorry, honey.  Quack, quack.  Well, look at her.  Quack, quack, quack.  Is he coming back in or what?  I'm bringing that on stage.  Where's boss?  He said he had to go to the bathroom.  Safe place.  Well, just get back in and just broadcast.  Why?  You don't need...  Please.  Hide your jacket.  No one's going to throw fucking sauce on the table.  Yeah, no one's going to...  For real sake.  Be real.  Be real for a second, Rich.  No one's going to ruin...  Waste a good marinara on that.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  Maranara.  Maranara rigat.  My mother, rest in peace, she made the best rabbit sweat jacket pie. 
[03:09:30]  She put marinara and a little bit of gravy and mayo.  God rest her soul.  You top it off with some rigat.  Yeah.  And a little bit of avocado bread.  Bread from the old country.  Oh, the way they made it back in the old country.  That's right.  I remember that, the days.  We never could get a good rabbit coat here in the States.  That's right.  Because everyone wearing one was murdered in a pointless vendetta.  They were all just shot down over honor.  But now, oh, my mother, God rest her soul, she made the best rabbit coat. 
[03:10:00]  She leave the zipper in.  Yeah.  She leave the zipper in for flavor.  God bless my mother.  She made shoes into hats.  How about the mustard?  That's where the flavor is.  Yeah, the flavor.  Some people take it off.  You got to leave it in there.  You want this too and then come back in?  No, I'm not.  Listen to me.  Listen.  I know for a laugh, you're violent.  You're violent and you're...  First of all, you're violent. 
[03:10:30]  Come back in.  I don't know why that one gets...  Which one?  He's got gravy, mustard.  He wants to make a salad out of my beautiful coat.  I waited all spring and summer to wear this.  No one is going to touch your dumb coat.  Rich, get back in here.  Listen, you've never needed me in a studio this bad.  That's true.  Okay.  You could have ended it as we never needed you in the studio.  Brewer.  Okay. 
[03:11:00]  What's up?  How is you?  We got you on the air.  We're still doing our show.  Nice, dude.  You know how frustrating it is to be listening in the mornings and wanting to call and I don't  have a fucking hotline.  Well, you got my personal phone.  I do, but I need a hotline.  I need a hotline.  Give him a hotline.  I'm going nuts because as soon as I drop off the kids at like 8.15, that's all I got until  9.  Nice. 
[03:11:30]  I don't even have the hotline in the car.  We wanted you to come by tomorrow.  Tomorrow's our last show of the year.  We're trying to get you in here.  Uh, I think I could do that.  What time, though?  God, that morning sucks.  What time?  Oh, four in the afternoon.  Yeah.  Well, any time between 6 and 11.  So you decide.  Christ.  All right.  I'll do my best.  I'm sick right now, too, bro.  Yeah.  So unless you want to get all diseased up.  Oh, hell no, man.  That's on your back.  But Jim, what do you got? 
[03:12:00]  This is Norton.  My immune system laughs at the flu.  You got the.  It's unidentified.  It starts in a snot box.  Who knows?  It could be fucking cancer for all I know.  Oh.  Oh.  That's not good.  How's your show doing, man?  I've done your show a couple of times, but only with Pete.  You were on the road both times.  I know.  Each time you came out, I'm on the fucking road.  Do you guys want to come on, too, with us?  I mean, we're only, we only got a couple of days, and I'm done with every day. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  We want to do it, like, in studio, though.  Listen to these two people.  You know, I thought you wanted to do, like, this week, I'll come in.  Or before the year ends.  Before December 30th.  I think, yeah, December 30th is, like, the last day.  Wait, you're not doing every day, Jim?  No.  No.  Oh, man, I want to, I want to get out there.  I'm, like, the, the family guy now.  Yeah, apparently. 
[03:13:00]  You're, like, Mr. Dad and everything, and that's, uh, that's your whole life, huh?  Mr. Dad.  It's over.  That was the.  The other days are over.  That was the.  Oh, God.  That's all that shit going on.  I'll tell you one thing, though, uh, I'm not getting anywhere near a fucking microphone  until after New Year's, after tomorrow.  Oh, no kidding.  I am not fucking coming in to do anyone's show.  Yeah.  Jim, we, we, uh, desperately need a break.  It's been a, it's been a, a long year.  It's been a long time. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, we need to.  I can hear it.  I feel like, I feel like, uh, sometimes I'll listen, and no disrespect, sometimes I'll listen  and I, and I want to, I feel like it's, um, there's snow outside, and I'm the only one  with a football, and I'd be like calling and going, come on, man, fucking play.  It's been on the curb for it.  Let's go.  It's that everyday shit.  I can tell.  It's like, hey, giving you a lot of body shots, a lot to the head.  Yeah.  I can hear you getting your asses kicked, man.  You know what, you know, you know what it is. 
[03:14:00]  You know what it is.  You know what it is.  Three week break.  You know what it is.  It's, uh, see, you, I don't think you guys over there understand it as much because you,  you were on the side that won the Cold War.  You know, we're, we're on the other side where, you know, it was XM.  See, Sirius, Sirius is the United States.  XM was Russia.  Yeah.  We were Russia, so we have to come over here and be like, I opened up hot dog carts.  I used to be the brain surgeon back in Russia.  Now I run a cart and serve donut in morning. 
[03:14:30]  That's, that's the position we are.  We're, we're second class citizens.  I'm sorry for your crazy studio, you guys there.  Yeah, we lost all our boys.  Yep.  We have no side decisions next year.  Yes, everybody agree.  Yeah, we, we lost our people.  We have no juice.  Russia, try Japan.  Yeah.  Fucking.  We got a branch out to, uh, Switzerland.  Two bright lights.  Exactly.  Two bright lights and a lot of shadows on the fucking wall. 
[03:15:00]  Burst.  XM employees gone.  What are you talking about?  And no more of that Negro, uh, the Patrice.  I don't like him no more.  He says terrible things about the white people.  But besides that, uh, we got the show, huh?  Yeah.  Jim, did something happen with you and Patrice?  Are you guys cool or what?  Oh, no, no, no, he's cool.  He called it.  I saw him at comics come home.  And he was, I never saw that side of him.  He was exhausting. 
[03:15:30]  He went on for four hours about, about, uh, just about, you know, white people, black people,  blah, blah, blah.  And he's determined not to listen.  He's just determined.  It has nothing to do with he's right.  It's just, I'm right.  No matter what angle you hit him, he's going to sit there and then figure out why you're wrong.  And so, he was so exhausting.  So, uh, you had him calling and he got so mad at me on the radio. 
[03:16:00]  Because I was just going, you just need love.  Is that what I mean, man?  Fucking no!  I'm fucking, I'm going to never know if that's all I need.  Fucking no!  That's all I need!  Thank you!  I'm cured!  Wait, now, wait.  You're hung up.  I'm sorry.  What was the tone?  I'm angry.  I'm a guy right now.  What was the tone of it?  No, there's no faith.  He's just really, he was, he was just fucking angry.  I told him he looked, I told him he looked diseased on stage. 
[03:16:30]  He did.  Holy shit.  He's just ugly.  He's got big, dark, ugly eyes up there.  But he is funny, though.  From being mad.  He don't even know what the fuck he's mad at.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I gotta say this.  I never knew this was going on.  Yeah, I didn't, I kind of heard briefly about it, but I gotta, it's like, when it comes  to the racial thing, but especially with Obama getting elected, Patrice talks a lot  about race, but I say this, though, he always seems to back up his point, even  if you don't agree with him.  He's always got an interesting angle on race.  We talk a lot about it on this show, and even when I don't agree with him, the point 
[03:17:00]  he makes, he's always got some kind of a salient point, even if I don't agree with it.  He just calls me a racist, and I agree with him, and problem solved.  He's a racist.  Yeah, of course.  And he's a racist.  Yeah.  He just doesn't get called it.  That's how it works.  He's a separatist.  I'm a separatist.  And he wouldn't care if he did.  Yeah, whatever.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's what I like about the...  But I didn't, I didn't hear the, uh...  What did I say?  I don't even know where I am.  Yeah, it's wonderful, with some Parmesan.  I, I just threw my hands up after 20 minutes. 
[03:17:30]  You know, and he was also talking when we were back, uh, and when we were there, not in  studio, but, uh, in Boston.  I had, like, my niece there, and she's dating this kid, and I wanted to strangle the kid,  because after a while, he's bound down to Patrice going, well, you know, part of the  problem is, like, our generation, because we don't like that, no, no, no, I don't get  him, so you think that doesn't do with this?  You bite at 22, and you're apologizing? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  No.  They're guilty.  I don't know anything about that.  It was just, it was a long, ongoing thing, but, like I said, if you throw one angle out,  whether it makes sense or not, he's gonna go to his sandbox, and find a bucket, and go,  see, no.  I found another angle to prove you're wrong.  It's just, I'm right, you're wrong, I'm right, you're wrong.  I got a lot of friends like that.  No matter what, do I, uh, that usually happens.  It's when you're either the only child, or, like, you're the oldest.  And what takes your shit when you're younger. 
[03:18:30]  I have a lot of friends like that, too.  I would have to say every friend like that, including me.  I'm right, you're wrong.  Pretty much all of us.  Go fuck yourself, man.  But we, we had him on, and we talked a lot about it, especially with the election, and,  uh, there was points, like, that I, I disagree with Patrice on when it came to McCain,  or whatever, and then he actually conceded it.  He was like, oh, yeah, okay, that point, I, I was wrong about that.  So, I mean.  Did you get that on tape?  Well, but I mean, he was, he was rational.  I mean, I, I didn't, we agree and disagree about, you know, half and half.  You know.  But I didn't hear you understand.  I would love to be not, me and Ant, Ante, you're on one side of Alaska, and I'm on the 
[03:19:00]  other side of fucking, we are worlds apart.  I was punching my radio.  I'm like, it's not the fucking thing I know!  I can't, I can't, I can't.  I wanted to, oh, we should have had a political debate.  We should have called in.  We'll, we'll get to the highline.  Oh, yeah.  Brewer, you can.  The highline is shit.  The highline.  Come in tomorrow.  I'll do my best, man.  I swear to God.  I'm supposed to, uh, go to DHA, this is 10 minutes away, and, um, promote this club in 
[03:19:30]  Jersey.  Oh, what a fucking fiasco that is.  Yeah, we're, you're playing on.  Stress Factory.  Stress Factory, oh, you're, oh, that's right, Vinny, uh, Stress Factory, 29th?  January 29th?  Yes, but there's, yes, it's the 29th, and then I'm doing, uh, the opening of a new club.  We'll get it, we'll get into that later.  Jim, December 29th, I said, I said January, December 29th, the Stress Factory, um, it's  one night only, Jim usually goes in and does one night, it obviously is gonna sell out. 
[03:20:00]  I tell you one night, then there's this new club opening up January 15th, I thought it  was like, an hour away from Vinny's, and it's like, you know, three miles away.  Well, walk slow.  Right.  Well, Vinny, it took me an hour to get there.  I was like, I fucking hate these guys, they fucking, they call me out, they said I'm a  douchebag, I'm like, oh, uh, oh, all right, well, I'm playing there two weeks, sorry, pal.  So yeah, that's the other place, I'm playing. 
[03:20:30]  So that's the whole thing with you, I'm gonna do my best to come in, where are you?  Where the hell are you?  Yeah, we're in, uh, Montana.  We're still in Howard's old studio, and then we got our own joint over here at XM.  Oh, a serious XM.  How is that XM building?  Well, we're gonna lose this because, um, we're going to.  Yeah.  You're coming to a serious building?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's some nice studios there.  Oh, nah.  Are they custom-made key banks there? 
[03:21:00]  Not big enough.  What are you kidding?  They are, actually.  So a lot of people are gonna have to find a new place to hang their coats.  That's right.  Because we'll be broadcasting from that room.  If they knock down, if they knock down four studios, then yeah, there's enough room.  We're at a picnic table.  No, we're in a tiny little glass studio, and, uh, it's gonna affect our show, but we're  trying to be team players.  See the studio?  Uh, it's gonna be a small studio. 
[03:21:30]  We haven't worked in a small studio in 10 to 12 years.  That's the one that we do?  Uh, it's a little bigger than what you got.  Yeah, it's kind of.  Do you want to think where it would be?  Across from Shady.  Across from Shady.  Oh, yeah, that corner one.  Yeah.  Right next to the gay station.  Oh, really?  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're gonna be neighbors next.  Can we drill a hole in the wall?  Are we behind the station or in front? 
[03:22:00]  We're gonna be, our neighbors are the gay station and Martha Stewart.  Unfortunately, my friend, I'm pretty sure you're in the, uh, taking it position.  That's fine.  Well, that's perfect for us.  Martha Stewart, we're next to you, too?  Um, all right, man, I'll, um...  Look, Brewer doesn't matter.  Like, I don't know that shit.  I need part of this.  All right, uh...  You know, the JV Mets fan?  What?  You got the email?  What email?  You don't email me anymore.  I don't know.  You don't email me, fags.  What are you talking about? 
[03:22:30]  Fags?  I don't have an email.  Wait, what?  You sent me an email about what?  No, no, no.  I said, do you have my email?  Address?  Just a fucking Abbott and Costello bit?  Yeah.  Get to the parents, you're both of you.  Oh, yeah, I got your email.  I'll send you...  You do?  Yeah.  Who's on Chris.com?  I can email about the exact place tomorrow.  All right, I'll do that.  All right, Brewer.  We gotta leave, so...  There we go.  Bye, Jim.  Bye, Jim.  We'll talk to you soon.  December 29th, Stress Factory.  Yes.  Are you on air?  You're on air? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  What do you think this has been?  I know it doesn't sound like it, but yeah.  Are you really?  I'm a fucking retard.  That was okay.  Holy shit.  Yeah, you're on...  Why do you think we're all talking...  You're on the mic.  Yeah.  We all potted you up on the mic,  because we got you on.  Yeah.  What?  I said that...  I said that at the beginning.  Have a good one.  All right, bye.  Where did Vos go?  Now he's gonna be like,  Oh, what did I say?  Uh-oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Now I...  You know.  That's why I asked about the Patrice thing.  I wouldn't have asked about that in private. 
[03:23:30]  They had a...  Vos and other thing.  Vos.  But I didn't ask you about that.  Rich.  What happened to Rich?  Come on back in.  Will you come in?  We're closing the show.  We're closing up.  We gotta do the plugs to get out of here.  Treehouse.  Treehouse Newsie.  Don't be a pussy, Rich.  I am a pussy.  I'm a pussy that wants to stay warm without fucking mustard on.  No, your jacket is made out of pussy fur.  Rich, bring your...  Rich, bring your coat in with you, if you don't believe me.  Come on.  Oh, really?  Yes.  How about a little trust for once?  Really?  Rich, really. 
[03:24:00]  Friendship is based on trust, Rich.  Is he coming in?  I'm trying to get him.  His plugs aren't gonna work, because the mic's off.  Oh, you turned his mic off?  Man, Sam, you're good.  Hurry up, because I want to leave right at 11.  I'm not...  Yeah, we don't know.  I'm not contracted to go past 11, so...  He left.  Voss does not want his jacket getting stuff thrown on it.  Hurry up.  We gotta end at 11.  Well, Nick has got...  Voss, we're not even gonna stay, because I'm out of here at 11.  Nick, what case do you have?  I have Caroline's January 1st through the 4th. 
[03:24:30]  If you go to nickdip.com for tickets, and pick up my new CD, Funny How.  Right.  And my, uh...  I had, uh...  The third show has been added for the Borgata, January 18th.  That's, uh...  The Saturday's sold, Friday's almost sold, so that Sunday's available, and no one has to  work the next day.  So go to theborgata.com.  Right.  Well, you can see me New Year's Eve at Crocodile Rock in Allentown.  Oh.  And watch me stand on stage of the shittiest club name in history. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  That is a bad one.  And do 40 minutes on Elton John, and how I hope he gets what we all know he's gonna get.  Fucking worst song ever.  A bad cold?  Exactly.  He sneezes, and his head just rolls off.  Rich, come to the door, at least.  Rich, come to the door.  He left.  Yeah, he's gone.  Richard left.  He actually left.  He took his fucking rabbit fur coat.  That coat meant a lot to him.  And purse a book. 
[03:25:30]  Hightailed it out of here.  He should threaten fucking up that coat.  He just got out.  Ran into the briar patch.  Oh, fucker.  All right.  Sorry for the literary reference, you retards.  Welcome back.  He really left, love?  Of course.  Yeah, he was catching the elevator.  Oh, that's wrong with him.  All right.  Well, if we...  He's smart.  Yeah, he's smart.  Yeah.  If we were going to stay past 11, it would have been brought to you by DirecTV.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  That's DirecTV, 888-961-DIREC-TV. 
[03:26:00]  And we'll see you tomorrow for our last show of the year.  Yes.  I filled my obligation.  Big shindig.  What do we have tomorrow?  Am I allowed to leave, or am I in trouble?  You're going to be in trouble at five, I'll tell you that much.  Yeah, you've got a meeting with a principal.  Yeah.  I filled my obligation.  It's like an office space with the flare.  You know, there's a minimal amount of flare you can wear, but they would like you to wear 
[03:26:30]  more flare.  Not because you have to, but because you want to.  Who do we have tomorrow?  Good.  Tomorrow on the program?  Sissy Spacek and Kevin James.  Why not say that?  We have basil teas coming in.  Oh, the food.  Big hit with the listeners.  Surprise, surprise.  Basil teas.  And David Tell.  David Tell is here.  David Tell.  But more importantly, basil teas, we're making food, which the listeners always love when  we get to eat.  They don't give a fuck.  Yeah, because they could hear us chew during the parts of the show where we're supposed 
[03:27:00]  to be funny.  Yes.  And we're actually going to do that anal beads thing.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  We have Shirley Jones is going to come in, and we're going to insert multicolored anal beads  into her hiney, while Bonaduce goes into her roid rage and just kind of fucks her ear.  Knocks him out from the other side.  Shirley Jones.  Punching her in the uterus.  Well, Dave Madden holds her down.  Is that a little bit?  Yeah. 
[03:27:30]  That's John Madden's brother, you know.  Is it really?  Yes, it is.  Are you kidding?  I swear to God.  How could I not have known that over all these years?  I fucking had an inkling years ago.  Really?  Yeah, because of their voices.  And sure enough, man, I was reading like a Sports Illustrated and it mentioned.  Well, did he ever, did Ruben Kincaid ever explain how he got caught file trading with  Jeffrey Jones and Pee Wee Herman?  He said, it's only art.  They're just frolicking.  It's kitsch art.  That's what they call it.  Jeffrey Jones and Pee Wee Herman.  You know what it was?  How early? 
[03:28:00]  Ruben Kincaid was a pretty slender gentleman on the Partridge family.  And then he disappeared after the Partridge family went off the air.  And then I remember a couple of years went by and he showed up on some variety show in  the 70s, one of these crap things.  And he was fucking gigantic.  Yeah.  So he's got those Madden jeans.  To the point where as a kid, I felt bad.  I'm like, that isn't Ruben Kincaid.  That isn't a Mr. Kincaid I remember.  I was a kid.  Change is the last name for our kid. 
[03:28:30]  Parillus, he was a big fucking house.  Yeah, yeah.  So I guess, you know, he does have those Madden jeans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The fucking Dave Madden.  Ruben Kincaid.  Infetto.  Let's get the fuck out of here, man.  Because I'm not going to hang out either.  My obligation is to 1104.  I signed a different deal.  I was going to say, what are you, a different lawyer?  Yes, four minutes.  I have four minutes longer than I have to spend on the air.  I actually signed until 1145.  Oh my God, did you get scared?  Did you, Jimmy?  No, no, I just rebel and leave early.  Yes.  I dare them to say shit. 
[03:29:00]  I leave at 1104.  I dare you to say something.  You can take those 41 minutes.  Come on, talk slow.  You can stay at 1145, really?  No, I'm just kidding.  What are you kidding?  No.  Jimmy?  Because I've been here where you guys are running right up to noon time.  Yeah, we've done that.  Thank you.  And they don't remember those days, do they?  No, no, we don't get to bank those hours.  It doesn't work like that?  You can't stand back?  No, no.  So I got my wife for Christmas right there.  Some wood.  Some wood.  Logs.  That's what I wanted for Christmas. 
[03:29:30]  A few logs.  Logs.  Yule tie?  No, no, not of that variety.  It's kind of that lay across your chest.  Oh, chest.  Well, you know, maybe if you want to waste them.  Hey, wow.  That's cool.  I'm Martha Stewart.  I want to see her throw a trophy at the Yankees and say, shove it up your ass.  That fucking hairdo.  She does have a little tanner boil.  She certainly does.  Hey, Lupus, nice try.  Really?  No, she bothers me.  I like to fuck her hand.  She has a nice hand. 
[03:30:00]  I'm very attracted to Martha Stewart's hands.  Make her put some flour on it first?  Have your cum gel up on that sweater.  Look at this guy.  Just cutting up an apple on my tuxedo shirt.  Please cut yourself.  Fucking dink.  Go ahead.  How great would that be if his wrist just sliced and he continued cutting the granny's?  Smith's apple while bleeding into it.  Find a note in the refrigerator.  I can't go on working with this cunt.  Oh, shit. 
[03:30:30]  Wait a minute.  She has a show, doesn't she?  Yeah, apparently.  I'm just kidding.  I was talking about the other friendship.  Of course.  Julia Child.  She was a fucking whore.  She really was Julia Child.  She was fucking, uh...  She was known as the, uh...  As the what?  As the fucking...  Power forward of cooks?  Nah, she was the deep dick queen.  That was the name.  She wanted it to be called Cooking with the Deep Dick Queen.  And they're like, no one will buy that show, Julia.  We know you're the deep dick queen.  We know you prefer dark and uncut.  You've made that preference known.  Are you talking about chocolate? 
[03:31:00]  We cannot call it Cooking with Julia the Deep Dick Queen.  No one will tune in.  I was in an elevator with her in Cambridge, Mass.  Really?  Yeah.  And you thought that was just a traveling basketball team.  I really did.  That was her entourage.  I thought it was a Russian fucking national team was in town.  Look, a chocolate fist.  Six foot eight.  Well, first suck on the penis, get it very hard.  You want to skin back like a fruit roll.  You clean the lint out and you rub pineapple around your head.  You dust the taint with some corn flour and... 
[03:31:30]  Make a nice fucking walnut casserole.  You have to clean the inside of the sheath like it's a horse penis.  And you shove it into your own asshole and yell, ta-da!  I like to put butter on my asshole.  No, there's no butter.  I'm the deep dick queen and you're cooking with me.  Cut.  You're not going to shoehorn the name in.  It's got to be called Bon Appetit. 
[03:32:00]  It's called Bon Appetit.  The other one's too long.  No one will buy fucking shirts that say Cooking with the Deep Dick Queen on there.  But I'm the queen of being deep dick.  We understand the reference.  We just don't agree with it.  This is a cooking show.  BBC does not stand for that.  We know you like Big Black Cock over a splanity, Jim.  Oh, it's...  Look, I'm making a stand.  I'm getting out of here.  Oh, come on, guys. 
[03:32:30]  You do have fun.  It's like a dance marathon.  People leave.  Couples are giving in.  I'm collapsing on the floor.  Goodbye, guys.  I have to actually do a little Christmas shopping.  I've been negligent in my duties.  I've done none.  I do it on the computer, man.  That's what I do, but now it's too late, right?  It's too late now.  Well, yeah, it's a little late.  I don't know.  You're going to pay $41 for shipping.  The shipping is, you know, for a $5 item. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  $43 shipping, please.  I ordered something for my wife, and then they send me an email confirming all the fucking shit.  Right?  They have my right street address.  Then it says Westbury, Long Island.  I go, how'd you do...  I filled it out.  So how the fuck did you get that address?  So I call.  Okay, we'll take care of it.  Next morning, I get another email.  Fucking same wrong address.  Yeah.  Call back again.  It'll go there.  I go, motherfuckers, if it doesn't show up, I'm flying to Pennsylvania, wherever you...  your shitty little company is, and I'm going to fucking burn the fucking place now. 
[03:33:30]  At least you handled it.  I did.  A threatened arson, because a fucking sweater and mittens didn't arrive in time.  No, I got a free fucking hooded jacket out of it.  All right.  Heath and Plow.  Yeah, we do have to...  All right.  Mother's going to rest her big wrinkled ass in that pot.  Take a big dump in there.  Go ahead.  Fill that thing with fucking...  Look, tomorrow, yes, our last day.  It's like our last little party day for Christmas and New Year.  And we've got Len Dawson and Flip Wilson. 
[03:34:00]  Yes, Flip Wilson will be coming into it.  And here come the judge bit.  We've got David Tell, and we're going to wheel in Otis Redding's coffin and dump him on the floor  and sing Doc of the Bay while we kick his bones around.  It's a tribute to the 60s.  Sounds like a fun-filled...  It really is.  I'm not a good wrestler.  Didn't Scott and Todd already do that?  Whatever the fucking shit.
