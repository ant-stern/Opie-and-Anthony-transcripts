<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts engaging in a profanity-laced tirade, liberally using terms like "fuck," "cunt," and "shit."  This immediately transitioned into a discussion of their recent firing from K-Rock radio.  They attributed their dismissal to a station format change to CHR (Contemporary Hit Radio), ironically noting their significantly increased ratings – a jump from a 3.9 to a 5.4 in the 6-10 AM slot –  and the poor performance of other K-Rock programs.  Anthony described his furious reaction to the news, detailing his near-destruction of their studio in a rage.

Opie then recounted a recent speeding ticket he received while driving through the Midtown Tunnel without his vehicle registration,  jokingly blaming a former police acquaintance, "Keith the cop," for his predicament.  He ultimately received only a ticket.

The show then shifted gears to a discussion of the movie *Black Hawk Down*, focusing on its portrayal of the Battle of Mogadishu, the violence of the conflict, its accuracy, the political repercussions, and the harsh realities of Somalia.  Jim Norton was identified as a guest on the show during this segment.  Finally, the hosts announced they were opening the lines to take calls from listeners, providing their phone number.

[00:04:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:30]  That whore.  Think of your mom.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  You know what she does?  She's an effing whore.  She takes in a dirty spot.  A dirty spot's a big gaping one.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Testing, one, two, three.  Testing, one, two, three.  Not that it should be any different.  Right?  What?  What?  Tell me why we're trotting over here at nine. 
[00:05:00]  True.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  See, it's fun.  We can curse now.  Woo!  You happy?  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, shit, cunt, cunt, cunt, shit, fuck.  Woo!  All right.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Heard exclusively on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Apparently.  Oh, well.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  You kind of missed a few things.  What happened?  Oh, you were in San Francisco.  Yeah.  Well, we had a dream.  I hear that went very well.  We actually did.  A lot of fans?  Yes.  Very, uh, would they send their regards?  Yeah.  Oh, very good.  No, we had this weird dream that we were doing something else, but it was a dream, and now  we're awake again, and here we are, doing our fine satellite radio show. 
[00:06:00]  Back, uh, yeah, back here.  Back in the, um, the, uh, XM Studios.  Right.  For, uh, the morning.  The early morning hours.  Jiminy Cricket.  I told these guys, I'm like, look, I need a day or two just to mellow out.  I think it's important to get on the radio immediately.  Yeah.  What are you going to do? 
[00:06:30]  So we're going to trudge through this, uh, this and figure it all out all over again.  But we got replaced by a, uh, what's called in the business a CHR format.  CHR.  Rumor has it that they're going to start playing 10,000 songs starting tomorrow.  What does CHR stand for for the layman?  I, I, I, you know, I've been saying CHR for so long, I, I, I forgot.  Isn't it current, current, current hit, hit radio, radio, or current hit, contemporary,  contemporary hit records or something. 
[00:07:00]  Records.  Yeah.  Something like that.  What it amounts to is, um.  Clobber her rectum.  What it amounts to is, uh, what, like Jonas Brothers?  Uh, well, we got the top, uh, we got the top pop songs in America.  10,000 songs in a row.  They really think that's going to work.  10,000?  We're allowed to talk about the format.  It might.  It ain't going to work. 
[00:07:30]  I'm not saying anything disparaging.  We're allowed to talk about a format change.  Yeah.  We're not allowed to talk about, uh, for a little while and, uh, and, uh, yeah, but  we're allowed to talk about our opinions on a format change.  That's for sure.  Positive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're going to try to take on Z100 in, uh, here in New York and, and, uh, and play  pop music.  Yeah.  And, uh, and apparently we don't fit in that pop genre. 
[00:08:00]  Well, that's okay.  Trust me.  We don't fit in the, uh, pop genre.  There are a couple of formats that, um, we would just never fit in.  Pop is one of them.  Right.  Country would have been another one.  Imagine like, uh, if you remember the hop along Howie, uh, a portion.  Sure.  That's why, that's why that movie is very funny, especially for radio guys.  Cause we all can relate to that bullshit.  You're, you're doing well with your radio show.  And all of a sudden these, these, these, these fine gentlemen that wear suits, yes, they come 
[00:08:30]  walking in cause they think they know best, but the suits don't really know best because  they're like failed radio show hosts because everybody started doing a college radio show.  And then some moved on to regular radio and watch and watch not and others realized quickly  they socked at doing a radio show.  So then they felt like, well, I suck at doing radio, but I could tell other people how to 
[00:09:00]  do radio shows.  Right.  So they walk in and with some brilliant idea and sometimes you're part of it and sometimes  you're not.  Sometimes they hand out the, the cowboy hats and go, Hey, yeah, you're going to be the  morning show for the new country, uh, country station in town.  And then other times they just say, well, we're getting someone else and X, Y, Z guy.  And you talked to some of those guys last night.  Um, I mean, there was, uh, there's a lot we're going to say eventually. 
[00:09:30]  Trust me.  We gotta, we gotta like, uh, do the right thing.  Yeah.  You know, I had a couple of conversations, but all, all of a sudden my, my phone's ringing  with people that were avoiding me for the last, uh, I don't know, month, a couple of  weeks, easy.  Now they're willing to talk.  Now they want to talk to you on the phone and blah, blah, blah.  It had nothing to do with, with, with you and Ann and what you were doing.  Matter of fact, you guys were doing quite well, but unfortunately the rest of the radio 
[00:10:00]  station was not doing as well as you guys were doing and blah, and, and no, it's a kick  in the teeth.  You hear what happened yesterday.  Our, our ratings came out and we went through the roof.  Really?  You hear this part of the story yet?  These are facts by the way, cause, cause we have our haters that'll spin in, you know,  have fun spinning and whatever we're survivors and we'll still be doing our radio show.  It never fails.  I mean, this will mean something to you and to some people out there. 
[00:10:30]  We went a three, nine to five, four.  Oh, and that was for the six to 10 number, by the way, six to 10.  So you take the extra hour.  Well, the shitty hour, right.  That no one was listening to, which was a fact.  Wasn't it actually called the shitty hour?  Yeah.  They called, you know, hoping after you're done, it's time for the shitty hour.  Not to take anything away from Nick Carter or whatever.  He's an, he's an all right dude, but he's so fired too.  Bye.  Bye Nick.  He is so fired. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Time to hit the old Kinkos, Nick.  Believe me.  So fired.  I got to tell you something, Jimmy, you weren't there yesterday.  We knew we were doing our last show, right?  And, uh, we, we, we started thinking that maybe we should burn the place down.  Literally.  I mean, almost literally.  Right.  And then I'm trying to hold back.  And then Anthony turns and, and dumps over that old TV.  I just had to take that TV and throw it onto the floor, that big old tube TV that we've 
[00:11:30]  been staring at that represented everything to me at that moment.  That TV was everything.  It was, it was old.  It had no new ideas.  It, it, it, it just, it, it was, it was stupid.  Yeah.  It tasked me.  Yeah.  It tasked me and I would have it.  So he three, nine to five, four. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  God damn it.  How, how great is that jump?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's always the case.  Trust me.  So, uh, uh, and you can, and you know, those numbers are available.  So if you think I'm bullshitting, go ahead.  You know, hopefully you can do a little math cause you got to take the, you know, well,  no, that's with, with the, uh, 10 o'clock hour in there or the nine o'clock hour.  So anyway, so it knocks over the TV and I'm like, all right, here we go.  I'm, I'm following Ant's lead for once.  I'm ready.  I, I, I was this close to jumping on the, uh, the board and just start kicking everything 
[00:12:30]  in.  Ready to wreck the gernt.  And then when, uh, we left and then obviously the, the word came down, which we knew it  would, we're not stupid.  We've been around a long time to know.  Then the whole time in my apartment, uh, apartment yesterday, I'm like, why didn't we  go out in a blaze of glory and just burn the place down?  Right.  Then an email comes from Mars later on in the afternoon talking about all the really  expensive equipment that is owned by Sirius XM that is still over there. 
[00:13:00]  And he has to get there today and get all that equipment.  I'm like, holy shit.  We would have been in deep trouble if we kicked in that big trouble, boy.  Holy shit.  That would have been a bad one.  So, Hey, look, you can't make it better, but at least this was something that the show  didn't fuck up.  This is one of those ones that it's nice to know that it wasn't like, all right, we  Yeah, that never happens.  It's usually like, why did we do that?  Why did we say that?  This is one where it's like, God, you dummies. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  But it ain't us.  There was another, you know, uh, 21 hours of programming that they had to concentrate on,  uh, that apparently, you know, they never were.  The three we were doing was just dandy.  And then they had, uh, you know, 21 hours of programming a day that, uh, uh, needed a  little help.  But I think in a way it's even more frustrating that we didn't do something stupid that we  actually, this time around did exactly what we were hired to do. 
[00:14:00]  And it was still not good enough because they couldn't figure out the rest of their  shit.  Yeah.  And that, and that's not saying anything too crazy.  And that's why it's frustrating, you know?  And then to get, uh, Mark going, Oh, by the way, you went from a three, nine to a five,  four.  Yeah.  You want to jump out a window.  It's nice though.  Mark was cool right to the end.  Cause he was left.  He didn't know what was going on either.  And I believe him.  He's been around a long, long enough to not be a bullshit artist. 
[00:14:30]  He got, he, I think he's out.  Yeah.  He said he's not going to be part of the whole, uh, pop music thing that they're going to  attempt to do.  Well, good luck to you.  You know, there was some markets we just had a tough time in and other markets where  shit happened that was beyond our control.  And this is, I think one of the ones that, uh, is, is frustrating is because we, we did  what we were supposed to do and did well.  Right.  And when Howard was there, K-Rock was, was had a tough time, man.  Even the rest of the day when he was there and he was doing monster numbers. 
[00:15:00]  And it was a fucking difficult station, but he made so much money for them that the rest  of the stations stuck around.  Apparently, believe it or not, rock in New York, just, it, it doesn't work.  It's the oddest thing.  Like you got Q104 playing what?  Classic rock.  And they're still doing the classic rock thing.  It's getting more modern now.  Yeah.  It's like what they're throwing in a new U2 song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, classic rock now, you know, is like Metallica and Nirvana.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the oldies station. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  Do they go, oh, future classic rock song.  A future classic.  I worked for a couple of those stations.  Future classic rock.  On the classic rock station.  Got to fit some new songs in, do you?  That's also the home of rock and roll.  On your Fox animal something station.  Shut up.  Yeah, so, uh, but apparently in a, in a city like New York, urban is huge.  Things like that pop.  Well, if you really want to get into it, the, um, the, uh, Spanish, the 18 of 40, 49 male 
[00:16:00]  demo is discovering satellite radio is discovering what they could do with their phones.  Uh, they're the ones going out and buying the iPods more than anybody that, that demo is  literally going away as far as regular radio goes, which made it, uh, that more impressive  that we were still doing very well.  Yeah.  But overall, those, those people are getting, are, are harder and harder to get because 
[00:16:30]  they're using new technology.  They're all about figuring out what their phone could do.  Yeah.  You know, I know what my phone was doing, uh, this morning.  How's that for a segue?  What happened?  Texting Keith, who I guess is asleep and right.  Club soda Kenny to tell him I was going to be a little late.  Right.  I was, um, I was on third Avenue right outside the old midtown tunnel.  With two cop cars behind me with the lights blaring, lights just flashing. 
[00:17:00]  And I'm just like, uh, God.  And then, uh, well, the, the, uh, uh, gentleman walks up to the window and I noticed his, uh,  his lovely captain's bars.  Yeah.  Captain pulled me over.  Oof.  That's a tough nut, man.  Is that bad?  That's, that's bad.  That's a bad one.  That's a bad one.  Because let me tell you something.  Yeah.  But just pull out those fucking PBA cards. 
[00:17:30]  No, no, not with a, not with a captain's hat on your mirror.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not with a captain.  You don't start throwing that crap around.  He's been around.  Will you hurry up?  I just lost one of my gigs yesterday and I need to get.  Come on, you guys would be sitting here while I was in cuffs.  Chop, chop, chop, chop.  Is it hard to give a captain a card?  It's hard to get pulled over by a captain.  They don't pull people over.  They get pulled over by Patterson.  They don't.  Yeah.  Why is it hard? 
[00:18:00]  They don't pull people over.  It's, it's, it's, yeah, they've done it for years.  They laugh at that stuff like that.  They laugh at it.  They're not going to.  I'll call some like.  The captains are not going to step out of the vehicle for a traffic stop.  So it's kind of bad when he steps out of the vehicle?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  It ain't good.  That would have been hilarious if you called and said, oh boy, they took me in today.  Well, apparently, no, because I did my move right out of the tunnel.  I knew I was done for. 
[00:18:30]  Here's what happens.  Yeah.  Uh, at 5 a.m. ish, when I'm driving, uh, down the Long Island Expressway, there are a multitude of people in my way.  I've discussed this time and time again.  The left lane, and I'm not even talking for doing 100 miles an hour.  I mean doing the goddamn speed limit, maybe a little over.  It's just people there in the left lane.  They will not get out of your way.  If they're going 75, though, let's be honest, they're slow. 
[00:19:00]  75?  You're talking about it.  No.  I'll be completely honest.  They're going 55 in the left lane at 5 in the morning?  60.  60.  Which isn't good.  Right.  75, if the road is clear to get around them, I'll go around them.  If there's traffic, I'm not going to try to make any moves.  I'll just sit there and suck it up and go, you know, I'm doing 75.  It's not bad.  I don't care.  But once I pass the exit for the Queensborough Bridge, which is Van Damme Street, it completely clears up. 
[00:19:30]  That's the last free crossing for the East River to get into Manhattan, is the bridge.  Traffic usually goes down nothing.  It sucks to take the bridge.  That's why I don't do it.  I take the tunnel.  Because only rich people continue at that point.  That's right.  Only the wealthy can drive past Van Damme Street.  Believe me.  All the scum falls off the bridge.  The riffraff has to take the old freebie bridge. 
[00:20:00]  You see that Van Damme exit backing up with, like, trucks with graffiti on it.  Yes.  Trucks that have foreign languages on it.  Oh, 1976 Toyota Celicas.  A lot of Toyotas.  Oh, it's just get out of my way.  So finally, that's where it clears up.  And that's where I hit the goddamn gas.  Right.  And I usually, I'll be honest, I usually do about 90 from Van Damme to the toll plaza for the Midtown Tunnel. 
[00:20:30]  Now, when I'm coming up that hill, there's a couple of livery cab drivers, some of those Asian buses, those little white buses carrying little Asian people.  Any Hampton Jitneys?  Some Jitneys.  Oh, so they are driving with a bunch of Asian people.  Whoa.  Look what you're doing.  Oh, that was a fun video.  That's insane.  How could you do that?  Oh, my God.  That's crazy.  We're in trouble.  The lawyers are going to talk to us about that one. 
[00:21:00]  What have we done?  Sorry, it's an Asian.  I had to do it.  Of course you did, didn't it?  So how were the little tiny dick fellas?  Oh, boy.  Stupid.  So, yeah, so I usually, I hit it there to get around as many of the big trucks and stuff that's going to be doing 10 miles an hour through the tunnel.  Right.  Which drives me bat, bat shit. 
[00:21:30]  I can't do it.  I can't sit behind them through the tunnel as they're just bambo, bambo, bambo.  It drives me nuts.  So I try to get through the toll gate as quickly as possible and around all those trucks.  Right.  And I'm one of those that don't stop at the toll gate.  I have faith in my placement of my E-ZPass and I know that gate's going up.  Holy shit.  So I do the old slow roll. 
[00:22:00]  I do the slow roll and let the thing pretty much tap off my windshield.  And then the second it opens, it's like English town, New Jersey when the Christmas tree hits green.  Whoa!  I goose it.  I get in the left lane of the tunnel and I do my launching the fighter from the Galactica kind of view.  Yeah.  And that's how I drive through the tunnel, perhaps a little fast. 
[00:22:30]  Well, I didn't know this, but this officer was in a black Lincoln like the ones that the town cars use.  And he was behind me, I guess, at some point before the plaza, in between Van Damme and the tunnel,  I had passed him doing 90 miles an hour.  Nice.  So he followed me through the tolls and into the tunnel.  Now, I thought he was a livery cab driver right on my ass.  So I'm going from the tunnel to the mirror, a tunnel mirror, because the tunnel's very narrow, very narrow. 
[00:23:00]  And in an Escalade, going very fast, it's hard to hold your lane, especially if you're checking your mirror.  I think they took that tunnel and it used to be like one big lane and they squeezed it down to two.  Yeah, they squeezed it to two.  Because, I mean, for the people that don't know about this tunnel, I mean, when Ant says it's very narrow, it is unbelievable.  You don't have much room on the sides. 
[00:23:30]  No.  And they put those weird, they're not even cones, they're like, what would you call them, those plastic pipes?  Yeah, they look like pipes.  They're made of plastic, but it looks like an orange pipe in the middle of the lane so you can't change lanes in the tunnel.  About three feet high.  Yeah.  And they're spaced out maybe every foot.  That's what I like when there's six months left on my lease.  Those things become nothing.  It's like a slalom course.  It's nothing.  I just, ah, I'm changing lanes, go screw yourself.  I had to jump in because of how narrow this tunnel is, to go 90, I'm just amazed, by the way. 
[00:24:00]  I mean, I'll push 70 and I'll be like, holy shit, I'm going to hit the sides of the wall.  Oh, it's fun.  Until you hit that curve at the end.  Because they also didn't figure it out, this tunnel, that it's not straight.  Yeah.  There's a lot, I don't know what the fuck they were, when they were.  They're turning to miss a fish.  They had to turn to miss a fish in the river at one point.  Turning to miss, I don't know what the fuck they did when they were filming this thing.  An accountant in cement shoes.  It's like driving through a birthing canal. 
[00:24:30]  But you gotta, it starts to turn nice right, and then it turns back left, and then it turns right again.  Picture when Schwarzenegger got dropped down that tunnel in Running Man.  That's what it's like driving through.  Running Man reference.  That's what it's like driving through there.  Anyway, sorry.  So the tunnel's very narrow.  So the tunnel's narrow.  I'm speeding through.  The guy's right on my ass.  And then as I look in my mirror at one point, the light glares off his windshield, and I notice he's got those little hidden, you're fucked lights in his windshield. 
[00:25:00]  Right, right.  So I start slowing down.  Day late and a dollar short.  I mean, way too late on this one.  So he's right on my ass, and I know once I exit the tunnel, I'm done.  I exit the tunnel.  I turn on to third.  And woo, woo.  It's him and another patrol car, a cruiser.  They've been chatting, haven't they?  Two of them.  Perhaps.  He comes out.  I see it's a captain.  I'm just like, oh, God.  All right.  Well, then.  And then I get. 
[00:25:30]  A few extra PBAs.  No, no.  Because I get a.  Chop, chop.  What the fuck do you think you're doing?  Is that his opening line?  Oh, yeah.  That's the opener.  He opened strong.  He opened with a strong one.  That's good.  That, to me, is keep your cards.  If I even see one, I'm going to get mad.  License, registration, and insurance.  So I get my license and insurance.  And apparently when Keith, Keith the cop, went two years ago to re-register my vehicle, 
[00:26:00]  he lost my registration.  He'll never fess up to it, but he lost my registration.  Right.  So I've been driving around without my registration card.  And I said I had to go then.  Officer, I don't have my Reggie.  Oh, how do I know you own the vehicle?  What am I supposed to do?  Just trust you?  He goes, yeah, I can take the vehicle now.  What?  And I'm just like, yes, sir, I understand.  He goes, you don't understand.  You're driving like a maniac.  You come up on that toll plaza. 
[00:26:30]  You pass me at 90 miles an hour.  You're driving reckless.  You're there.  And I'm like, yes, sir.  I understand, sir.  And he's like, you don't understand.  And then I'm just looking.  He goes, what's the rush?  And then I was like, yeah, okay, here we go.  This is where you said, I'm Anthony Cumia.  I said, I go, I'm a little late for my job.  He goes, what job is that?  And I said, I'm a radio host.  And he asked the show.  I said, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:27:00]  And he said, what happened to your registration?  I go, well, one of your compatriots there kind of.  You threw Keith under the bus.  I threw Keith squarely under the bus.  I said, lost it.  He's my security guy.  And he was re-registering the vehicle and seems to have lost my registration.  He goes, stay in the vehicle.  I'll be right back.  So he goes back.  And I'm expecting just to have him take the pen to me.  Right.  Pretty bad.  And apparently he just wrote me up for not producing a registration, which all I have 
[00:27:30]  to do is produce a registration.  It is registered.  Right.  I just don't have the card.  So I have to do that.  And I'll be fine.  So I thanked him.  And then you got to do the old, I'm a safe driver.  As you pull away from the cop and feel stupid, you feel like you're on your driver's test.  Let me put my blinker on.  I'm going to use my hand signals.  What's for the left?  10 and 2.  I'm going to use my hand signals.  10 and 2.  10 and 2. 
[00:28:00]  Let me do 20 miles under the speed limit now as I pull away, looking in my mirrors, making  sure no one's coming.  And then you got to drive like a schnook through the lights and everything.  But as soon as you were safe and sound and he was long gone, what do you do?  The finger like he could still see you?  No, once I made the left on 57th.  Yeah.  It was English town all over again.  But wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I texted Kenny, told him I was going to be late. 
[00:28:30]  I got pulled over.  Hell of a day to get pulled over.  Arnold.  Yeah.  So that's how my morning started.  Wonderful.  Fan-fucking-tastic.  That's perfect, though.  Yeah.  It really fit the whole thing.  I should have just opened up the newspaper where it says, you know, Opie and Anthony get  the axe and go, could you let me off the hook for old time's sake?  We almost made the front page.  Page two.  Page two.  That's pretty impressive.  Opie and Anthony get axe from K-Rock. 
[00:29:00]  It's like, you know.  I'll just add it to the collection.  Where is the...  It just makes it sound so, you know, oh wow, they sucked and couldn't cut it and now they're  off.  And it's just not the fucking case.  But, like you said, there'll be the people that spin it like that.  Well, go screw.  I got so many goddamn phone calls, too, last night.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry. 
[00:29:30]  Stop it.  I go, it happens.  It's in radio.  I've been doing this stupid shit for 14 years now.  It happens.  Was that your brother or your sister?  Yeah, believe me.  My brother, my mother in South.  Anthony, what's going?  What's going on?  Do you need your sheet metal job back?  No, Sal.  I'm okay.  What are you doing?  Are you still on the satellite?  Yes, I'm still doing satellite radio.  Oh, good.  Yeah, but he still...  What happened? 
[00:30:00]  He's still trying to figure out what the satellite is, though.  Oh, I know.  Is that up in the sky?  He has childish questions.  Right.  Four and a half years later, he's still trying to figure out what that really means.  Is that like Sputnik?  Yes, Sal.  It's just like Sputnik.  Yeah.  Oh, so I had to deal with that.  Then my brother called.  I'm trying to watch Black Hawk Down.  Lift my spirits up with the way that movie goes.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Wrong place to get a flat.  Oh, yeah.  But let me tell you, the score was great.  19 to 1,000. 
[00:30:30]  We win.  Holy shit.  That movie's great.  That movie's great.  Oh.  Unbelievable.  And on the big screen, dude, it is fucking ridiculous.  Yeah.  That is a great movie.  Ridley Scott just knows how to make really good movies like that.  Those action movies.  I've actually never seen the movie, but I did read a lot of the book.  And there was a part in that book.  He actually said there were certain things that he changed.  One of them was, when they're attacking him, when they're going after him, I think he said  they beat him with the arm of another soldier. 
[00:31:00]  Like, they beat him with the severed limb of another soldier.  They did cut out the brutality that went on with the dead soldiers and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Respect for the soldiers' family.  The author did that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They showed him in their pants, with pants kind of ripped up, the dead soldiers being  like just like a mosh pit, almost.  I think that was one of the reasons Clinton pulled out of Somalia.  And when that happened, I'm not blaming Clinton for anything.  I'm just saying when that happened.  Should have been in there like that, in that capacity, in the first fucking place. 
[00:31:30]  We were in there for aid, to give them fucking food.  The warlords were stealing the food and selling it.  So you know something?  Go fuck yourself then.  Let your people starve, continue your genocide, and we'll just leave.  But then they let these guys in with their hands tied behind their backs, which was just  ridiculous.  They wanted to back these guys up.  They were trying to get one of the warlords and bring him in.  And they wouldn't let them use some of the best equipment that they could have used because 
[00:32:00]  it was too high profile.  So they just let these guys in these not even armor-plated Humvees and Blackhawk helicopters  and a couple other types of choppers.  And they just got chewed to pieces with RPGs and underestimated the amount of weapons and  people that came storming out like cockroaches, came storming out of every nook and cranny of  Mogadishu.  And it was just a bad scene.  Brutal when you think of those guys just crashing your helicopter. 
[00:32:30]  You're fucked up.  That one guy's legs are just broken.  And he's sitting there shooting out of the windows of the crashed helicopter.  It's like a video game.  They just kept coming at this guy.  And then the other two guys that landed got out of the helicopter to back up this one  guy and wind up getting killed.  The heroics that that takes.  Holy shit.  They requested. 
[00:33:00]  Two guys.  Snipers.  We want to get on the ground.  We want to secure this area.  Against hundreds of these guys.  And they went out there, took the guy out of the helicopter, secured him, gave him a gun,  said, watch our backs, went right back out, and just front to front, head to head, started  a firefight with hundreds of guys.  They both got killed.  And they both got killed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jonathan said, my manager, Jonathan, people know, travels the entire world.  And I think that's the one place he said he would really, he'd love to go there, but 
[00:33:30]  he would not feel safe.  He finally figured out that there's places you shouldn't go.  Yeah, there's places you just don't go.  Mogadishu he wouldn't go to.  He travels to a place like that he would go to.  We should get him on sometimes, man, because he knows people.  Well, you would have to have an armed escort everywhere you go.  Yeah.  He's traveled like that before.  And sometimes that doesn't even help.  Yeah.  Because they'll just mow down everybody in your little convoy.  Yeah.  Armed escorts, everybody.  So, yeah, that place was just, ooh, a little hotbed. 
[00:34:00]  Hotbed of activity.  The scene where they take the infrared beacon, the one guy, and throws it up on the roof where  there's just hundreds of what they call skinnies on the rooftops.  And he throws the infrared beacon, and now the helicopter, the guys in the choppers with  the night vision can just see this thing blinking like crazy.  And the Somalis just pick it up and kind of look at it like, what's this?  Because it doesn't, it just looks like a little box.  Meanwhile, from the helicopter, it's just beep, beep. 
[00:34:30]  And these coppers come in and strafe the rooftops and just make chop meat out of these guys.  Chop meat out of them.  It's amazing how small amount of rangers were against such a huge amount of Somalis with  AK-47s that apparently were very horrid shots.  They're just notoriously known for being bad shots.  And they were able to hold these guys off.  But I watched the documentary, too, on it. 
[00:35:00]  That's the second disc, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The documentary on it is really good, too.  It gives you, it shows you, you know, what they elaborated on a little bit.  Some of the characters, they condensed into one character and things like that.  But really, boy, I highly recommend that one.  I watched the whole thing now.  I watched part of it.  I watched a good part of it.  I never watched the end of it.  I don't remember why.  I just didn't.  And I think I wanted to read the book first before I actually finished the film.  Yeah, that's great.  That's definitely a good one.  I've just been loading up movies like a maniac and that thing. 
[00:35:30]  It's so nice.  Now that it's, you know, now that you've got it all completely nice.  People said that when Clinton pulled us out of there, like a lot of people said, you know,  that Clinton said, all right, enough with these motherfuckers.  But then Al-Qaeda saw that.  Yeah.  They thought the U.S. was paper tigers because, like, oh, you show a few dead American soldiers.  That's it.  And the whole country falls apart and they back out.  And not only that, you show a few dead soldiers, but unfortunately you desecrate them on TV and Americans don't have the stomach for it. 
[00:36:00]  And you will win.  They will pull out.  And, yeah, that kind of, that was a little full paw.  They should have just sent more people in and really started wiping them out.  But they had their own logic over there, too.  They were like, you get rid of one warlord?  What do you think?  The killing's going to stop?  One of the guys was saying that.  Yeah.  He goes, this whole place is about killing.  He goes, negotiation is, killing is a negotiating tactic. 
[00:36:30]  It's like, wow, these guys are fucking hardcore, man, you know.  Africa's a rough place.  Oh.  Yeah, it's Africa, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And they're just, yeah, there's this, just, genocide that goes on over there that people don't understand because you figure, hey, you know, you're one nation.  What the hell's going on?  They're just, in most brutal ways, machete battles.  It's like fucking watching Braveheart.  It's like Connecticut attacking fucking Rhode Island.  Yeah, yeah, with machetes.  It's insanity. 
[00:37:00]  I'd like to see that.  I would too, actually.  There's no unity.  You picked two fine states.  That would be a nice one to watch.  Who do you give it to?  Right.  Connecticut, because it's so long and boring.  I mean, they would just talk Rhode Island until asleep and lock their heads up.  I'd have to give it to Connecticut in two.  All right, let's take a break.  The phone's a little late.  We're going to go to the phones next.  What phone number are we using?  They can see it.  What is it called?  I mean, I know it's on their pad data, but some people are on the internet and all over the fucking place.  Yeah, the number is 866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[00:37:30]  That's also 866-969-1969.  All right, we'll continue in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton. </pre>
