<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of Kim Jong-il's death, punctuated by darkly humorous speculation about life in North Korea and the playing of what they believed to be North Korean news coverage.  This segued into a discussion of Kim Jong-un, his age, and South Korea’s reaction, followed by jokes about Obama's delayed awareness of the news.  Internal show issues, including Mars' absence, IT problems, and Opie's frustration over the show's contract end date and unexpected work day, were then aired.  They engaged in nonsensical banter before discussing the impact of a previous legal warning ("Words Hurt") on the radio industry.  The NFL playoffs, specifically the Jets and Broncos, and the absurdity of NFL touchdown celebrations and the Red Zone channel's anxiety-inducing nature were discussed, along with a video showcasing extravagant touchdown celebrations.  A discussion about a Patrice O'Neal 16-hour audio compilation on Audible benefiting his family followed, announcing the upcoming guests: Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, Anil Kapoor, and Stephen Merchant. The segment concluded with banter and a discussion of Sex's house-buying experiences, including a buried oil tank, and pay disparities within the show's staff, comparing E-Rock’s apparent wealth to Troy's more modest lifestyle.

Further discussion focused on the financial differences between E-Rock and Troy, with jokes about E-Rock's new four-bedroom house, past investments, and perceived lack of work ethic compared to Troy.  The conversation transitioned to Sam Roberts, his fiancée Jess, and their decision to abstain from sex until their wedding night, sparking debate and jokes, including speculation about Sam's premature ejaculation.  This led to a phone call with Jess's mother, during which the hosts revealed Sam's condom usage and the potential implication of Sam's sexual performance anxieties, eliciting humorous tension. The mother's response was mostly unfazed.

The call with Sam's mother continued with sexually explicit jokes about Sam's alleged sexual performance issues, E-Rock's supposed sexual prowess, and a comparison of condom usage to baking techniques.  This devolved into a discussion of Sam's salary compared to E-Rock's, more sexually charged banter, and Sam's sex life.  The conversation also touched on her Christmas traditions, Jimmy Norton's views on sex, and a news story about a woman burned alive in an elevator, all delivered with graphic descriptions and dark humor. The segment ended with the arrival of Simon Pegg and Paula Patton from *Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol*.

Simon Pegg and Paula Patton discussed Pegg's experience filming a scene hanging from the Burj Khalifa without a harness.  The conversation covered Pegg's career (including *Mission: Impossible*, *Star Trek*, and *Slumdog Millionaire*), Patton's bikini photo in a New York newspaper, and Bollywood lip-syncing.  Stephen Merchant then joined, discussing his upcoming US stand-up shows, adapting his humor for American audiences, working with Ricky Gervais, and the differences between British and American audiences.  They touched upon celebrity in the age of social media, North Korea's political situation, and Merchant’s upcoming HBO project, *Life's Too Short*.

The interview with Stephen Merchant focused on his stand-up comedy, comparing American and British styles, citing various influences. He discussed his nervousness about performing stand-up in America, his work with Karl Pilkington, and humorous anecdotes from "Idiot Abroad."  The conversation included comparisons of British and American television, including discussions of nudity and shows like *Mad Men* and *The Sopranos*.  Benny Hill and Chris Morris's *Four Lions* were also mentioned.  He concluded by promoting his stand-up shows and the Patrice O'Neal audio release.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yabba-dabba-doo!  Yabba-dabba-dabba-doo!  Bye, everybody!  We are live, Monday...  This one says Monday, December 16th.  There are so many...  This one says Monday, December 19th.  So many fuck-ups on various levels today.  All you have to do is say, Kim Jong-il is dead, so we're live.  Kim Jong-il!  Kim Jong-il!  Oh, he's dead. 
[00:00:30]  You thought of a heart attack.  Oh, is that what it was?  You thought of a heart attack on a train.  Give me a heart attack over here.  Yeah, he was on a choo-choo train.  And doing God's work.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, a little heart attack got Kim Jong-il.  Kim Jong-il, and boy, are they just busted up about it in North Korea.  They're fucking crying on the news.  It's pretty funny to watch.  Well, he was a great leader for those people. 
[00:01:00]  The newswoman said he died from all the stress placed upon him for being the supreme leader  of the great and prosperous nation of North Korea.  Don't they have one light bulb?  They know how to spin shit.  Yeah, they got one light bulb in the royal palace that he got to use, and no one else  was allowed to use electricity.  When you look at the satellite photos at night of North Korea, it's just completely dark,  and the capitals lit up a little bit. 
[00:01:30]  Well, that's the one light bulb.  Yeah, they're one light bulb.  The rest of the people just can't afford.  Their infrastructure doesn't have electricity.  No, they're not even allowed.  They're not allowed to have light bulbs.  No.  Well, that's how bad it is.  You want to hear the official report?  I would love to.  All right.  I hope you know Koreans.  Ah, let's listen in.  I think I got this.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Fox News alert?  That must be their news alert over there.  Wow. 
[00:02:00]  That's Mission Impossible.  Wow.  Oh.  What was that?  I was like, wow, their news music is cool as fuck.  I know we have Mission Impossible people coming in today.  That's hilarious.  Look at this.  I was like, their news fucking song is great.  Well, let's play it over there.  Let's try a little something here.  Off the cuff.  Oh.  We do this over here.  Their news alert.  And then we do this over here.  And then we do this over here.  And then we do this over here. 
[00:02:30]  It sounds like a hostage negotiation. 
[00:03:00]  That's action-packed.  Yeah.  This announcement.  And...  That's hilarious. 
[00:03:30]  Damn.  Well, McRivvy has got the quote here.  The translation. 
[00:04:00]  I came to Pyongyang, North Korea with two bad knees and a dream to rule the Korean Peninsula.  That's hilarious.  That was great.  Wow.  She's all broken up about the news.  That was a woman?  The dream came true.  Yeah, that was a North Korean woman.  Oh, my God.  I thought there was a guy.  She was dressed completely in black and very sad.  Very sad indeed.  Yeah.  So there you go.  What changes now because that happened? 
[00:04:30]  Anything?  Well, apparently there's a 28-year-old son.  Oh.  Kim Jong-un.  Kim Jong-un?  Kim Jong-un.  Who is...  There's going to be a transitional phase that they're not sure if it's going to be quick or take quite a while  because they think he's a little young.  How old is he?  He's a little mature, 28.  Okay.  A little young to be the head of such a prosperous nation as North Korea.  So...  Just an amazing place.  Yeah.  Can't wait to visit someday.  And he looks just like a younger version of Kim Jong-il. 
[00:05:00]  With the wacky hair?  Yeah.  He's got the wacky hair.  He's a little fat, fucking roly-poly, short little thing.  Ugh.  And yeah.  And South Korea went on full alert.  They put their military on full alert.  And they're just taking a great interest in this.  No mourning or anything.  They could give a shit.  So that's where we stand there.  We'll see what the future has in store for North Korea.  Will they get leadership that's a little more open to the world?  Will a younger leader introduce more younger technology, such as some social networking 
[00:05:30]  that will open up the Korean people to what is really going on?  Because they have no clue, really, what's going on in the rest of the world.  How about they slow down and introduce a VCR?  Yeah, yeah.  What do you mean social networking?  Beta.  How about they start with a little VCR action?  A VCR would be amazing.  Maybe black and white TVs for everyone.  I mean, they are behind.  Yeah, they're really far behind.  And they're one of the few nations that really are still on the world stage that don't have  a real concept of what's going on in the rest of the world. 
[00:06:00]  Their people are pretty much blacked out.  You're going to enjoy this, Anthony, because I know how much you love Obama.  Obama had to be woken up with the news.  Oh, he was sleeping?  But I was thinking to myself, why doesn't Obama get Twitter like the rest of us, and  then he would have the news?  Yeah, just check your Twitter.  Look, I had a horrible night's sleep, and when I'm not sleeping at night, I roll over and  I'll check my phone.  It's like, eh, well...  You know, I'll do about five minutes on my phone and hopefully roll back asleep. 
[00:06:30]  He was sleepy.  He's very, very, very busy.  But in this day and age, someone has to still call him to tell him this stuff.  Yeah.  He's very busy trying to get a fucking...  What is it, a four-day extension on the payroll tax?  Two months.  Two months.  It's like, yeah, let's do that.  Let's just fucking squeak it by.  Well, because everyone wants to go home for the holiday.  Yeah.  Because that's more important.  That's much more important.  Than work on the country.  We're here.  Huh?  We're here, even.  Yeah, we're here.  Yeah.  I love it, God.  We're barely here. 
[00:07:00]  We don't matter.  Huh?  If our guys aren't even here.  Yeah.  Is Mars on vacation, or is he just out today?  Is Mars gone now, officially?  Mars is not in today, is the official statement.  Oh, boy, okay.  Mars won't be in, all right?  And here's the IT staff here.  The IT staff.  Yeah, we noticed that.  We don't have any toner, which is another problem that arose.  Our little...  Our lists that we have today of various guests that are coming in, what times they're coming  in, our show prep stuff, is...  It looks like an old ditto from school that the Inc. ran out on. 
[00:07:30]  I want to make this perfectly clear.  I want to make this perfectly clear.  When we're at the end of our contract, which is October 1st, it ends, right?  Ooh.  I don't want them bitching that we don't have any more days to take.  Remember, we're here Monday, December 19th.  No one else is in the building.  We're here.  So don't tell me we don't have days to take.  What happened?  We had to come in because Kim Jong-il died.  Yes.  It's the only reason we're here.  Yes.  We just couldn't not address Kim Jong-il. 
[00:08:00]  Kim Jong-il.  Is that his chubby fucking son?  That's his chubby son.  He could play chubby baby.  Yeah.  You know what he should do as I'm looking at his face?  Dye his hair blonde.  Oh.  Oh, now.  Why?  Why?  Kim Jong-i rock.  Kim Jong-i.  He's 21.  Oh.  Kim Jong-sexy.  Yeah.  Sexy.  Kim Jong-sexy.  So, Ron-ry.  Yeah.  So, Ron-ry. 
[00:08:30]  It's Ron-ry.  So, Ron-ry inside real Ron.  E-Rock just went rogue.  We didn't even ask for this.  He totally went rogue.  We didn't even ask for this.  South Park.  Of course.  Team America.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Weary hard.  They made a lot of Asian word jokes here.  Yeah, but if we do this on the radio, what happens, man?  What happens?  They didn't read words hard.  Ear.  Hard. 
[00:09:00]  I'm Ron-ry.  Well, he's dead now.  I'm Ron-ry.  Poor riddle.  How do you get a country full of people that are literally starving to death, have no creature  comforts, and they just...  Obey you?  They're fanatic.  Not even obey.  They're fanatic about this.  I don't know.  That's just...  So odd.  It really is odd.  Jimmy brought up something.  Words hurt.  Oh. 
[00:09:30]  Was that the day you knew we were fucked?  Oh, dude.  The fact that that...  When that...  Ah, the jerk off.  With glasses.  Words hurt.  When that jerk off...  Which one?  I'm not going to say his name, but I'll just say, we're not pornographers here.  We're not pornographers here.  All right.  Oh, God.  I remember that one.  A jerk off.  He's an attorney for CBS.  Yeah.  Gave us words hurt.  And he keeps his job.  The whole industry is fucking destroyed.  Ruined. 
[00:10:00]  And you could point your finger at that one guy.  We're not pornographers here.  Yeah.  For tearing down all the interesting shit that kept people tuning in.  Because even back in the day, Mel Karmeson was listening to this guy.  He hired these lawyers and said, look, take care of my company.  Let's keep my company safe.  But they went so far that they basically destroyed regular radio.  And he's the only guy that continues to get a paycheck.  Amazing.  All these years.  There's been more people in and out the revolving door that is CBS radio division. 
[00:10:30]  And he just continues to survive and thrive.  And the numbers are way down.  And he continues with his gig.  But what Jimmy referred to is the famous pamphlet, Words Hurt.  Words Hurt.  And we're not even kidding.  That was the title.  Words Hurt.  We looked at this thing like, you've got to be shitting me.  Words Hurt.  Words Hurt.  God.  I picked the Broncos and the Jets yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah?  And then someone's calling me a dummy.  I'm like, how am I a dummy for picking the Jets and the Broncos?  The Jets are my team, so I have to pick them.  Well, the Broncos, that was the one.  That was the wild card yesterday.  Yeah.  That was the weird.  You know, is this?  I thought something crazy could happen.  Yeah.  They're playing at home and all that.  You never know because Tebow's pulled some shit out before.  Yeah.  But it was supposed to be a nice afternoon of football.  And it became a bust. 
[00:11:30]  Both games.  Yeah.  Both games were a bust.  The Eagles destroyed the Jets.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  They destroyed them.  And they still have a chance at the playoffs now.  Will the Eagles do?  Yeah.  As long as my Cowboys won.  Your Cowboys won.  Yep.  Giants really prove what shit they are.  I'm not a big Giants fan, but I can't talk today, man.  Giants fucking let their fans down.  The Jets let their fans down.  Yeah.  I had a funny tweet about the red zone. 
[00:12:00]  Well, I wanted to watch the Broncos game, you know.  But, of course, in New York, the Jets were on, so they didn't show it.  They black it out, as they say.  Yeah.  How greedy is the NFL?  They're fucking the worst, dude.  It killed me, too, because, you know, this Tebow thing's got us all wanting to take a peek.  I got my Jets.  I'm going to watch the Jets, because I'm a Jets fan.  You got the Jets fans.  They're going to watch the game.  Yeah.  And they're so fucking greedy.  They want that number to be so large that they fucking, they don't put the other game on. 
[00:12:30]  It's so frustrating.  It's raging.  Sorry.  But, no, that's okay.  Red zone did have it, though.  Right.  So I went to red zone, and, again, it's, I tweeted last night,  watching red zone is how I imagine a nervous breakdown to be.  There's just, like, but instead of watching red zone, like, life is just hitting you from all angles like that,  and you just can't fucking take it.  I was watching it and just, like, getting anxiety. 
[00:13:00]  Getting anxiety watching it.  They're going, like, I just, and I just wanted to watch, you know, the Denver game.  Denver Pats game.  But right when I switched it on, they were going to halftime.  So then they just willy-nilly scatter you all over the fucking country with all the other games,  and it's like, ah, I'm watching the Raider game.  Holy shit, there, you know, ah, it's a Raider kickoff.  There you go, ah, now we're going back.  What are the Lions doing?  That's great.  What is Cleveland doing?  Ah.  And then he said something that almost fucking put me over the edge. 
[00:13:30]  Let's go quad screen.  Ah.  Now there's four games up on my screen.  I mean, I don't know what to look at.  I'm freaking out.  It's the greatest invention.  It's the greatest sports invention of the past few years.  But it's all the good shit.  So you're just, like, you're sitting there watching all the Red Zone shit.  Yeah.  It's just, and then they showed mostly the Pats fucking Denver game.  Well, that's what they do very well.  They still focus on an important game. 
[00:14:00]  Because they knew everyone wanted to watch that one.  So you're almost feeling like you're watching that game,  and then you get the highlights as they're happening.  It's, ah, it's the best way to watch football.  But, you know, I'm a Time Warner guy, so I'll just have to wait.  Red Zone is the shit.  But, man, just take a few breaths and relax on it.  And there's no commercials.  So you're watching some coverage of the game,  and then you'll hear, like, that da-da-da-da,  like they're going to commercial music that you're used to.  And, like, Pavlov's dog, you sit back and you go, like, 
[00:14:30]  ah, I could, ah, but they don't take commercials.  Bam, they're back to another game.  Holy shit.  Holy shit, I thought there was a commercial.  So I relaxed for a second.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  Man.  Oh, yeah, that's the guy.  That guy's amazing.  Holy shit, the announcer there for Red Zone.  I don't know how he keeps up with the whole fucking thing.  Is in fucking sane.  This guy is every game, every player.  He knows absolutely what's happening.  What happened with the Jets?  He's, um, uh, what's his face he did?  Took quite a hit.  Sanchez. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Sanchez, I think he fucking hurt his clit or something.  It looked, uh.  I think he bruised his clit.  It looked like nothing from the clip, but you saw, like,  I guess whoever hit him, hit him with his helmet on, on his helmet,  and he just, you saw his arms drop to his side.  Like, he was knocked the fuck out on his feet.  Yeah, he said his arm went numb for a little while, I think.  Yeah, he pretty much got knocked out.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  That's, uh.  I don't know.  I don't know what the problem is with the Jets.  I don't know.  I don't know if it is.  I don't know. 
[00:15:30]  What's their record?  What are we now?  Uh, eight and six, is it?  Eight and six, I believe.  That's Dallas' record, too, I think.  And the Giants are, uh.  Giants lost, too.  Giants are, yeah, about seven and seven.  What do you think of, um, the touchdown celebration?  Now, Santonio Holmes, he, uh, scored, and, and, and the Jets are getting killed,  and then he, like, puts his foot up on the football and tries to do an eagle to mock,  uh, the Eagles fans.  And then he did his jet, and they, uh, penalized the Jets 15 yards, and it's, like, unsportsman-like, 
[00:16:00]  you know, conduct or whatever.  And I'm thinking to myself, who's bothered by that?  Oh, yeah.  Who?  I mean, I guess you do, because the other team's bothered by that, but they're real men playing  the sport.  So there's not a guy on the field that is bothered by any of that shit.  So why do they do that?  The NFL does it to keep it from becoming a sideshow, is what they do.  They nip it in the bud, as they say.  Right.  It doesn't offend the other team.  It doesn't offend the viewers.  But as far as NFL goes, they don't want it turning into this big fucking, I love a parade 
[00:16:30]  in the end zone.  Let me tell you what you do.  You know, allow it to be a sideshow.  So, and then maybe, if you have to, don't show it on TV.  Well, then that pisses people off.  Yeah.  Because you want to see it.  Everybody.  Whenever the crowd's going, wah!  And you're at home, and you know they're not showing something, like someone running  on the field, getting the shit beat out of them.  Right.  It pisses me off.  Some of these touchdowns, though, are really intense, and it's the perfect exclamation  to a great score. 
[00:17:00]  Who is the guy that scored last night, and he goes up to the padding at the bottom of the  fucking, the goal post, and just starts boxing it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was like, what is that shit?  And they're all ignoring it.  They're all still celebrating, and they're giving out that 15, is it 15 yards?  I think it's 15-yard penalty on the kickoff.  They're all doing it, and you see the coaches, they're not yelling at their player.  No, they don't care.  What was the score of the game when he did that?  Oh, no.  He was stupid for doing it when he did, because it was like 20, what was it at that 
[00:17:30]  point?  28-7 or something?  If you celebrate when you're down 28-7, you are a jerk-off.  This guy's doing river dancing.  I absolutely agree with you, but my thought is, who the fuck is really bothered by this?  I think it's hilarious.  I think it's hilarious.  The old coach.  I think it's hilarious.  Yeah, this is hilarious.  We're looking at epic touchdown celebrations.  I didn't know there was an epic touchdown celebration video.  There's quite a...  This guy ain't stopping it.  He's dancing up a storm.  How great is that, though? 
[00:18:00]  Let him be idiots.  Let him be fucking idiots.  I gotta say, the black guy's got this shit down.  But look, we're all laughing.  We're enjoying it.  How is he doing?  That's not even a touchdown celebration.  He's dancing.  Yeah.  Who's the guy in the Bengals?  They're showing him a lot.  I don't know.  Offhand.  Holy shit.  Look at this video.  681,000 views.  There's a little red.  Not many people dislike this shit.  What is that?  People love this shit.  They look silly because they're in football gear. 
[00:18:30]  They're dancing around.  This guy's trying to break dance with the ball.  This guy picked up some of the pom-poms.  Holy shit.  I'm only annoyed if they do it when their team's getting their ass kicked.  Well, then you just look stupid for doing it.  Oh, my God.  What a douche would do that.  Icky shuffle.  That was the icky shuffle, Ope.  But I don't know who was bothered by this except for the asshole that runs the NFL.  The No Fun League, someone tweeted yesterday.  No Fun League.  No Fun League.  We can't have fun.  Terrell Owens. 
[00:19:00]  Terrell.  Terrell.  I have no idea.  No, we'll call him Terrell.  He told us to our face.  It's Terrell.  Oh, really?  Oh, well, when the rest of the world starts calling you that, maybe I will.  Yeah, you don't call anyone else out on it, but you did us, right?  He was an asshole.  Louis is doing, sorry to interrupt you, the correspondence.  I know.  I saw that.  How the fuck?  He's having a year, huh?  That's amazing.  I don't know if he's actually hosting it or if he's just doing a spot.  I think it's, doesn't it say?  He's headlining it.  Headlining, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  That's huge.  But, man.  From the president?  Yeah.  I think he's going to make a few stories after the fact.  Yeah.  Sometimes comics get up there and they say a few things that make people uncomfortable.  Who's done it in the past?  Uncomfortable.  Imus did it one year, right?  Imus.  Imus has done it.  Leno's done it.  Who was great?  It was Seth Meyers was great.  All right.  That's a great host.  I think a lot of them just performed.  Didn't Whoopi get up there and fucking get in trouble because she said something bad?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You see the video of Whoopi farting? 
[00:20:00]  Yes.  She's disgusting.  Oh, my God, dude.  You know, that's where she got her name.  When she was a kid, apparently she farted all the time like a Whoopi cushion and they called  her Whoopi.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and I guess she hasn't stopped.  I was so embarrassed reading everyone's Whoopi cushion jokes on Twitter.  I'm like, dude, do you really think you're the only one that came up with that?  This is her farting on the air?  All right, let's hear it.  You haven't seen this yet?  No, no.  Oh, it's so disgusting.  Whoopi Goldberg farts.  News now.  Whoopi lets it rip on The View Friday morning. 
[00:20:30]  The 56-year-old funny gal suffers a flat-grunt faux pas that's live and loud.  During a serious chat with actress Claire Danes, Goldberg gambles with passing gas on the down-low  and loses.  We're still kind of redefining ourselves.  Our identity was really questioned, and I think it explores that in a really smart way.  The star is quick to apologize for her tooting mistake. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, excuse me.  I just blew a little crowd out of there.  Oh, jeez.  The comedian has admitted to passing gas on TV before, saying that's why she's been called  Whoopi Cushion.  Yeah, she's living up to her name.  Oh, God.  Boy, what that must have smelled like.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  What's Whoopi eating these days?  I don't know, man.  That fart was broccoli rabe and yogurt. 
[00:21:30]  So you enjoyed your red zone experience?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a good one, because I really don't have any, I don't really have anything going  on in the game.  I don't have money on it or anything.  But just to be able to watch, you know, I wanted to watch the Denver game, a little bit  of it anyway.  And the Jets and, you know, whatever else was going on.  It was kind of cool.  That red zone is the Shires night.  How was your weekend, Jimmy?  You were far away.  It was far away land. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I will say about the Albany area, I never draw crowds there.  But I love the gig.  I got a lot done.  Ooh.  As far as, I did really, really long shows for me.  Good.  Yeah, I got a lot of material worked out for, I'm happy.  I love, I'm very happy I did it.  Crowds were great, but they were small.  But up in the Albany area, literally a nuclear bomb could go off up there, I'd be happy.  Yeah, was it freezing?  Cold, yeah.  Very cold.  I just don't draw up there.  Like, I don't draw.  No matter what I do, even no matter how the show is doing, it doesn't matter. 
[00:22:30]  How weird is that?  It's okay.  It's like better there than fucking...  And then you move a hundred miles west or east of there and it's packed.  It's so bizarre.  They're impoverished and it's fucking Christmas.  And what's different in Albany than other places?  I don't know.  I've never done well there.  Except the crowds at Ducam are fucking fantastic, man.  Right.  At the...  Loyal.  Smart core.  Yeah.  It was really, really fun to work on the material.  Nice.  Hey, did you hear what's happening with Verizon, Fios?  What happened?  This is really fucking pissing me off. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, I knew I should have stayed with Time Warner.  Well...  I knew it.  I'm in.  Here's the...  I just waited it out.  Yeah.  Tell the world.  Here's what's going on.  Verizon is deciding that they are going to concentrate more on their wireless business, their phone  business.  So they are stopping any further infrastructure builds on Fios.  What?  Yeah.  No more buildings are going to be getting it.  No more...  If they're on the contract right now, they're going to be getting it.  That's it.  And then, in time, they say that they're going to keep up with who has Fios right now, but 
[00:23:30]  in time, it's going to be broken up and sold off to your remaining stupid cable providers  like Time Warner and everything else.  It had to be some...  I know.  I lost my fucking mind.  That's a backroom deal that went on.  It's a backroom deal from Time Warner and Cable Vision.  That's how powerful these companies are.  That went, you motherfuckers, you're not going to do this.  And they made a deal with these other cable companies that those companies will start advertising  Verizon's phone service on their cable, on Time Warner and on Cable Vision and whatnot. 
[00:24:00]  And coincidentally, now Verizon Fios is offering MSG.  MSG.  In HD.  So it's all a big fucking, fuck the people that want a good product, as long as these  motherfuckers could still make their money and don't get cut out of the loop.  So instead of Time Warner having to step up and actually make a cable platform that people  want to have in 2012... 
[00:24:30]  Wow, that's a mafia shit.  That's enraging.  Oh, it's fucking mob tactics.  And we love the mafia.  Don't get me wrong, but...  Mob tactics.  That was a backroom deal.  Time Warner saw them nipping at their heels and said, we got to stop this shit.  Had a little meeting.  Time Warner and Cable Vision said, look, we're losing so many fucking customers to Verizon  Fios.  What can we do?  Wow.  All right?  Hey, you got that phone company there, Verizon.  How about we help you out with that?  Look, we're going to give you fucking MSG.  We'll do this.  You just stop doing what you're doing and let us fucking take care of the cable business 
[00:25:00]  here at the docks.  That makes me so angry.  It's fucking infuriating.  When I read that, I lost my fucking mind.  That's big company shit.  Yep.  It's all around us.  The only thing is that it's going so internet and cable is on its way out anyway, and that  will eventually be wrecked.  I would hope so, yeah.  Because a lot of the stuff I do watch is at this point on Netflix and other various internet  delivered media.  There's no way our Fios is going to be as good, though, because they're not going to  upkeep it.  They're not going to upkeep it. 
[00:25:30]  There's not going to be an upgrade.  There's not going to be anything new.  And then they're going to just divvy it up between shit Time Warner and shit Cable Vision  who won't, they won't do anything as far as customer service and just making it something,  spending a few bucks to update it every few years.  Now, they'll make sure the cable now catches up and is better, and then Fios will see  them awful.  Right.  Isn't that great?  What?  Fuck Verizon.  What scumbags Verizon are?  Just scumbags.  Oh.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  I got on here like a fucking cuck, just extolling the virtues of Verizon Fios, spreading my asshole 
[00:26:00]  open for you.  Scumbags.  And that's how I get fucking thanked as a loyal customer that's spreading the good word  of how great the platform is.  Now, I'm an asshole.  And I'm right again.  Yeah.  Well.  For being lazy, look at me.  For being lazy.  Yeah.  That makes, I'm fucking, I'm physically, I want to punch something.  I know.  Yeah.  When I first read it, I literally threw, threw my fucking computer at the laptop like, 
[00:26:30]  die, you fucks.  What?  Cocksucking motherfuckers.  They had Time Warner, man.  They had them.  They had Cable Vision too.  But Time Warner is so powerful, they're like, whoa, let's talk to these guys.  They did what XM did with Sirius.  XM was ahead, they were doing good, had all the latest technology as far as satellite radio  goes, and then they just went, oh, let's just roll over and spread our ass cheeks for Sirius.  I'll take the hit today.  Bye.  Really?  You had XM and you had Sirius. 
[00:27:00]  XM was a much better company.  Yeah.  And really understood satellite radio.  Yeah.  And they had some really talented people and understood how to make these channels fucking  smoke.  Yeah.  Sirius went the other way and they decided to hire one guy to, you know, to keep their  company running, Howard Stern.  Yeah.  And pretty much like you just said, they wiped out, like, the state-of-the-art shit.  Yeah.  And the people that really knew what the fuck they were doing in satellite radio.  They had a, remember XM had a whole R&D section on the new radios and new technology 
[00:27:30]  just to get shit better.  Their technology was way better.  Their channels were way fucking better.  Their personalities were way fucking better.  How about just fucking being able to drive through a tunnel?  How many years has it been?  Drive through a tunnel.  Right.  And still continuously hear my satellite.  You know, the, and there's only one good time that that happens.  And it's in the Midtown Tunnel on my drive home when I hear that, that last word from  primetime Sam Roberts on the shit show.  You're extremely obsessed with this, Sam Roberts. 
[00:28:00]  I'm getting a little nervous.  I'm getting a little nervous.  You bring it up a lot.  Yes.  Well, I have to listen on the way home.  There's 200 channels.  Oh, no.  I have to listen to see if you're undermining our brand.  With your wrestling talk.  Oh, my God.  It's not there.  No.  You're forcing us to go to 10.15 every day.  Ugh.  Please.  Not on Friday.  Well, on Friday we were here.  Almost to 10.  Almost.  We almost made it to 10 on Friday.  Almost.  You're right.  But same shit. 
[00:28:30]  Where a bigger company comes in and just wipes out a lot of the cool shit.  But Verizon's a big company, man.  There's a reason they're doing that.  Maybe, A, they're not doing as well with sales as they wanted.  Or...  It's probably expensive to wire these buildings.  Too expensive.  So Time Warner goes, look, we know what you're spending to wire these buildings.  Let's make a deal together.  We'll save you money and we can work on this together.  But again, it's less competition now and they don't have to.  Time Warner can now...  At this point with that announcement, Time Warner now don't have to do shit. 
[00:29:00]  No.  They just made it where the government just used to do shit.  Well, watching a TV show.  Well, when does the money go to the...  Yeah, we go...  I like that.  Oh, it's great.  I bet you...  But I bet you that they see that the amount of money it costs and where it's not worth to do.  Because whatever the next technology is may make it not worth doing.  Whatever's around the corner. 
[00:29:30]  We got a Fios guy on the line.  He works for Verizon.  All right.  Maybe some inside info.  Coming out of Buffalo, New York.  Let's hear.  Oh, ho.  Stout.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up, man?  Uh, Buffalo has actually been one of the better selling areas for Fios.  And they've basically been dangling in front of us that if we run our balls off and get this shit in the air,  that we're basically, you know, it's our future, too.  And now by this deal, it's basically just going to... 
[00:30:00]  You know, they can turn around and they can sell Buffalo in a big piece and sell Albany in a big piece to, you know, Joe's Cable slash phone company.  Uh-huh.  And, I mean...  And you're out.  We're going to bend over and take it and you guys are going to bend over and take it.  Yeah, it's too bad because they had a good thing going, man.  They could have just hung in there.  Why did they do it?  Maybe they're running out of money.  I don't know.  Maybe they're running out of capital.  I honestly believe it's...  On one hand, they do want to...  Now that they've gotten iPhones, they want to step up their just wireless business. 
[00:30:30]  But I also think there was something that went on with Time Warner.  And this is speculation.  With Time Warner, Cablevision, and Verizon, Fios to say, you know, to save Time Warner from looking as shitty as they fucking are.  Yeah, but they could work together because Time Warner's in...  Not tactics.  Time Warner, I'll just talk for Manhattan.  They're in every building.  Fios isn't.  And Fios was looking ahead going, we have to wire every single fucking building in... 
[00:31:00]  Well, not every, but...  That's in Manhattan.  Yeah, but then maybe they just said, you know what?  But now we could get in the Time Warner market by just making out, you know, working out this deal with these guys.  Saves them a lot of work.  Makes me...  I want to bite somebody.  I'm so fucking angry.  And this cable analyst from Wall Street wants to correct me.  I don't know what he...  And there was no guarantee that Fios was going to completely take over the market.  So, you know, they had just their bet.  We get stopped on the side of the road by people that want this stuff up here.  I mean, they're literally standing in the end of their driveway. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, you guys are like the ice cream truck when you come pouring into a neighborhood.  Yep.  All right, let me go to Jay.  He's an analyst there, sir.  Thank you.  That's Stout in Buffalo.  Here's Jay in New York.  Jay, what do I need correcting on?  Um, no, you're fine, Anthony.  Good morning, guys.  Hi, buddy.  I'm actually heading into the Midtown Tunnel, so I hope I don't lose you.  Oh, boy.  So, uh, the background of this is, uh, Verizon's $3 billion on this network, uh, going back  about eight years ago. 
[00:32:00]  Um, the agreement that Anthony is kind of, uh, reading is basically a consortium of cable  companies, including Comcast and Time Warner, have entered an agreement to mainly sell wireless  spectrum to Verizon.  And Verizon, in return, is doing a cross-promotion across its wireless stores, um, and will sell  the cable product.  But they have said that they're going to discontinue, uh, upgrading, uh, their Fios.  No, they haven't said that.  What they've said was...  I read it. 
[00:32:30]  ...the plan was to build out 18 million homes fast.  They're at about 16 to 17 million, so they're not going any further.  You're correct in that.  Yeah.  But they're not, they're, Fios as a product will continue to exist, because it's a superior  product, as you've pointed out many times in the past.  But their, their, their, their deal, as I've spoken to the company, is, hey, you know what,  like, we'll cross-sell our stuff, uh, with cable, because, uh, our stuff's better.  Boy, let me ask you a question, buddy.  Why would they have had an 18 million dollar, 18 million household goal? 
[00:33:00]  It doesn't make sense.  Um, so, so, so, if they, Verizon's footprint is about 14% of the use.  So, 23 million homes, they built it, they were going to build it in 18 million, just  because that was, it was cost effective.  So, yeah, they're scaling back, uh, another million or so homes, just because, like, uh,  Jimmy pointed out, it is a fortune to build this.  It's one of the worst investments in the history of, uh, telecom.  Wow.  See, that's why they had to make two deals.  Too expensive to wire the buildings. 
[00:33:30]  Did you say in there they'd lost three billion dollars?  No, no, so they spent 23 billion on the build.  So, so the reason Anthony loves it, and he's right, is because they're giving you a Ferrari  for the price of a Pintel.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Maybe that's it.  So they just couldn't keep up financially.  But, uh, but, uh, but, uh, but, uh, but as Opie, as Ergo, and Jimmy, as it's available,  I mean, the product itself is far superior.  I, I have it, and I love it.  Um, it's not perfect, but I really love it, and I know now it's not, the answer, it's not 
[00:34:00]  going to be improved.  I just hope it doesn't, uh, end up getting busted up and sold off, which is what I read,  uh, as far as a speculation goes.  But, uh, this is one of those situations that just look like if Verizon wants to start just  concentrating on the wireless business and getting out of the cable business like this,  uh, you know, it's going to hurt the, the viewers, of course, the users of a cable, of,  um, files.  One last thing, though, not to get too technical, it's just that the wireless and what's called  the wireline businesses are, are very separate, one's a unionized workforce, one's not, and, 
[00:34:30]  and the wireless business, in fact, is actually only owned half by Verizon.  Vodafone, uh, based in the UK, owns the other half.  Remember Vodafone?  Wow.  Hey, what's bigger, Verizon or Time Warner?  Oh, Time Warner.  Um, Verizon, no, Verizon as a company is much, much bigger.  That's, yeah.  Oh, I meant as a, did you mean as a company?  Oh, just because they didn't, they didn't get bullied by Time Warner.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Verizon, Verizon, Time Warner is much bigger. 
[00:35:00]  Time Warner is 12 and a half million, um, um, cable basic subs, as they're called.  Verizon has about four million.  Four million's a lot of fucking people, man, in a few years.  Yeah.  Oh, no, they're, they're doing great because it's a great product.  But, but it's just too expensive to get it in, right?  Yeah, it, it, it, it, the numbers, when we last ran them, it basically cost them $5,000  per home pad.  Yeah.  So, and is there another technology around the corner which would just make it not worth 
[00:35:30]  it because by the time they start to catch up and make their money back, the new technology  is what everybody will be buying anyway?  Well, the new technology is, is wireless in general.  I think so.  When, isn't all this going wireless anyway, Jay?  Um, yes and no.  Um, so Verizon's building this 4G network that you might all have, but the problem with wireless  is there's just not enough capacity to give, uh, uh, video services in the same way that  you, you get on your, your cable, your cable motor at home.  Um, so, so, so wireless is the future for sure, but you're always going to have cable 
[00:36:00]  inside your house.  And, and per Jimmy's question, um, that the technology of course will always evolve, but  right now what Verizon did was insane because they're actually building fiber optic, uh,  cables directly to your home, which no one, um, um, yeah.  So we're not going to lose that, are we?  No, no, you're not going to lose, I mean, they're not going to start digging up, uh, the streets  and, uh, okay.  Yeah, but if somebody else gets, uh, control of it, I don't know if it's going to be run 
[00:36:30]  as well or, you know, I don't know if I don't fucking, what do we know?  These are not good consumer companies, but we're all in agreement with that.  But, uh, I think if you've got it now, you're safe.  Um, but, but like you guys were saying, uh, no one knew is getting it.  It's over.  Well, the only problem with me is, I mean, now around my building, I've been known as  the fiber optics kid.  Pfizer optics.  I tripped on fiber optics.  I went to say fiber optics kid, but my throat is still a bit scratchy. 
[00:37:00]  Pfizer optics.  Pfizer optics.  Yeah, I'm the Pfizer optics kid.  Now go analyze some more stuff.  Yeah, quickly, quickly.  Well, before you bore everyone.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, Jay.  Good work, guys.  Bye.  Is it a buy or a sell?  That's what we should ask.  Well, that's what we should ask him.  Oh, he's Jay.  Oh, is it a buy or a sell?  Oh, you, oh, you can call me Ray.  Wowie kazowie.  We got your Patrice O'Neill news today, right?  What?  Is this official? 
[00:37:30]  Um, I believe it is, yeah.  Gary was saying.  Um, we, uh, we worked hard behind the scenes to get this done.  Uh, the 16-hour Patrice O'Neill special that, uh, the boys put together is now available  for you to, uh, download through Audible.  Uh, it's four segments, $5 a piece with all, and I mean all.  This is a very rare thing that happened.  Yes.  With all proceeds going to Patrice's family.  That's fucking cool as shit.  Audible is A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com. 
[00:38:00]  They asked us to spell it.  Yeah, I think.  Dummies.  You know, we, we, we, well, certainly me, I bitch and complain about this fucking place  a lot, but, uh, Sirius XM did the right thing on this one, big time.  So it's, uh, the Patrice O'Neill special.  There's four segments.  It adds up to 16 hours of Patrice O'Neill material from our show, and it's $5 per segment  with all proceeds going to Patrice's family.  You can do that right now if you want.  Audible dot com slash Patrice.  And that's why it's a little bit more than normal because, because you're, you are donating 
[00:38:30]  to Patrice's, uh, his family.  So all, all proceeds.  Oh, we just said go there.  All.  So it's a total of 20 bucks for 16 hours of material.  Or, you know, maybe just grab a couple of the segments.  Sure.  Whatever you want to do.  I'm sure there's a description for each, uh, segment there.  So that's, uh, that's huge.  Huge news for Patrice's family.  Yeah, very good job by, uh, Sirius.  They were left, they were left in a tough spot to, to say the least.  Fuck yeah, man.  All right.  Um, we got Mission Impossible guys coming in today.  Yeah, we do. 
[00:39:00]  So, Simon Peff.  Well, it says Simon Peff on the, on the track.  Someone wrote Simon Peff.  Simon Peff will be here.  That's correct.  Simon Pegg was really good in this movie.  Really good.  He's, he's funny, man.  He's going to run a skeleton crew this week.  That's all.  That's, yeah.  Good run a skeleton crew.  Well, we got, how many people work for the show this week?  This week or today?  Today.  Uh, today it's, there's me and Eric and then, I think Troy's here and Roland's here because 
[00:39:30]  the Mission Impossible people.  Right.  Okay.  Uh, we got Paula Patton who's, uh, who's a looker in this movie.  She's coming in.  Simon Pegg's coming in.  And, uh, Anil Kapoor.  From, uh, who wants to be a millionaire.  Yes.  Millionaire.  He's in Mission Impossible for about five minutes, so.  But he was good in it.  Although, who I'm really excited about is coming after them.  Stephen Merchant?  I've not met Stephen Merchant.  Yeah, he, uh.  I couldn't be happier.  He was great last time he was in.  So, he's playing Town Hall or something? 
[00:40:00]  He's doing stand-up or something, right?  Yeah.  Right?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah.  Yeah, Stephen Merchant will be in here.  Who, uh, co-created a lot of the shit that you enjoy out there, man.  He, he co-created Extras.  He co-created the, uh, English Office.  Yeah.  Ricky Gervais was the face of all that, but he fucking.  Oh, yeah.  He fucking created this shit with Stephen Merchant, man.  Yeah.  And it's Stephen Merchant's, uh, time to shine.  Tim Canterbury.  Canterbury Tales.  Canterbury.  What a dumb thing to say.  Canterbury Tales.  Gareth Keenan in the area. 
[00:40:30]  God, what a perfect, perfect line that is.  Yeah.  Bugs me.  That tool.  It's so good.  Hey, you want to, uh, you want to eat?  Yeah, let's eat.  I would do that.  Ho, ho, ho.  Well, if it isn't fat, stinking Eric Nagel, how art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking mayonnaise?  Come and get one in the Yarbles.  If you have any yobbles, you eunuch jelly thou, viddy well, little brother, viddy well. 
[00:41:00]  Fuck you!  Your mom don't know shit.  Oh, shoot.  I, uh, shoot.  Oh, shoot.  I was gonna, golly. 
[00:41:30]  I know what we gotta do here.  What up?  Oh.  First of all, we gotta listen to the fucking words for a little bit.  Wait!  But it's time.  The fact is a guest.  But it's all right.  I'm just with your face.  It's a guest, guest, guest.  Get in topical.  Hold up!  Wait a minute!  With the sex man. 
[00:42:00]  What's up, sex here?  Hello.  How was your weekend?  It was, uh, busy, but good.  That's boring.  What does it, what does that mean?  Well, it was boring.  I was doing a lot of house shit.  Oh.  You got a house?  Uh, almost there.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Sexy's gonna be in a house soon.  Had to do the, uh, house inspection.  They had to do the, uh, the lawn scans.  The floor joists?  I gotta make sure.  Eat your cookies. 
[00:42:30]  Whoa!  Damn!  Oh my God.  Eat your cookies every day and someday you could be like E-Rock.  Yes.  Gross.  Big and fat.  This bitch makes good cookies.  Oh.  Well, she is the, uh, the cookie champion.  I'm eating cookies in the morning.  Wait, is your mom the cookie champion or is Paul's, uh, mom?  No, you gave that title to shitty intern Matt's mom.  Oh, yeah, Matt.  I remember him.  Yeah.  Who was that guy?  Who?  By the end of this week, he'll be forgotten forever.  What did he do?  Nothing.  So who's gonna be the cookie champion now? 
[00:43:00]  Well, my mom makes the best cookies.  But she hasn't brought in cookies, so she's not even eligible.  Right.  But, tis the season, isn't it?  Who's the current leader holder?  Matt's mom.  I guess.  No.  These are better than stupid Matt's cookies.  And then Jimmy's gotta decide if these are better than Matt's cookies.  Matt's mom's cookies.  Matt's mom cookies sucked a dick.  Let's all be honest.  I didn't eat anything Matt brought in.  We might be changing titles today.  I love Matt's mom's cookies.  I didn't trust Matt.  No.  So I didn't eat anything he brought in.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Uh, sex it.  What was the lawn scan all about?  Uh, because they, there's documents that say there's an oil tank buried in the property,  but then they can't find the official documents for the oil tank.  Like, it just suddenly disappeared.  So they had to do this, um, this HD x-ray of the backyard, the front yard.  Oh, that sounds expensive.  Oh, really?  How does that cost you?  Well, wait, part three's coming up this week where they gotta do the whole driveway into  the garage to finish off the property.  Man.  And do you have to? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  And you have to pay for this?  The first two I didn't, it was the homeowner's responsibility.  But the third one, because we didn't, they couldn't find this mysterious oil tank, and  we said we wanted the driveway and everything else checked.  So now that's coming out of my pocket.  Because you wanted a check.  Yes.  And how much is this?  That's, I think the estimate was like $725.  Oh, my God.  You know.  And I did the house inspection this week, which was about $450.  So, uh.  Jesus Christ.  You gotta spend so much money before you can actually pay for the damn house. 
[00:44:30]  There's an underground oil tank on your property that no one can find.  Supposedly, yeah.  Because back in the early 90s, there was documents of it, but there's no, um, environmental  certification that it was removed or filled.  Oh, boy.  The town has no record.  The county has no record.  So, there's these old documents.  Yeah.  That's a lot of money E-Rock's spending.  But you know what?  He's well paid.  He's got it, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, E-Rock's got that money, man.  Oh, yeah.  He's got it.  Everyone on the staff should get a house. 
[00:45:00]  What do you mean?  We can.  When you win a lottery.  Everyone on the staff should get a house.  Why not, right?  Well, I'll tell you, I actually have an answer to that question.  Why?  Why not?  Well, none of us can.  I can't afford one.  Troy can afford one.  If E-Rock can.  If E-Rock can, I can picture, yeah, Troy buying one.  Where's Troy?  Sam, you do a lot for this company.  You should be able to afford a house by now.  I can barely afford my one bedroom.  Where's Troy?  Unbelievable.  Troy, I think he should be in the other room.  We ought to get him in here.  I want to try to ask him if he's cool with E-Rock getting a house. 
[00:45:30]  I'm sure he is.  For the people that can't figure it out, Jimmy has decided to stir the shit.  Well, not only with E-Rock getting the house, but with the extra expenses involved.  Well.  What are you going to do with that oil tank if you find it?  Well, they have to.  Store food for the winter?  Yeah.  They have to remove it or I'll slide back out of the deal then.  Fill it with garlic butter saw.  Saw.  Where is this oil tank?  Man, that bothers me now.  We don't know.  What are you eating now, Jimmy?  I'm eating fudge.  Oh, God.  You want a piece of green fudge? 
[00:46:00]  Could you pack it first?  Look, it's green with envy.  Oh, no.  Stop using that goddamn joke.  Anytime anything's green, chipset it's heaviest.  Yeah, it's green with envy.  Well, what else is it going to do with that?  Nothing.  Just eat the fudge.  Oh, by the way, sexy.  What was that Stones thing about?  Well, there's two things.  One, on this date in 1971, Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange premiered in the United States.  Forty years ago.  And in 1975, the Faces broke up and Ron Wood joined the Rolling Stones. 
[00:46:30]  Well, that was a smart move on his part, I would have to say.  75 he joined them?  1975.  He announced it officially in February, but he was with the band in December of 1975.  Damn.  Troy, you mad that E-Rock has a house?  Well, I mean, he deserves it, right?  I mean, he works real hard and puts in a good, solid day's work.  Oh, boy.  With Troy was on the after show.  When E-Rock posted on Facebook, all right, we bought a house.  As if, like, this is a big accomplishment, I'm excited. 
[00:47:00]  The next day, Troy was on the after show yelling at E-Rock for bragging about buying a house.  Oh, shit.  But aren't you supposed to be friends with E-Rock?  I'm confused about this whole thing.  No, we're not a boss, though.  Yeah, we're friends.  Ooh.  I mean, we're friends.  We're not, like, you guys are intense, though.  We're not, like, best friends.  But, what's cool?  We're not friends.  I thought you guys were pretty close.  I was like, why should you work like you do and watch him work like he does?  And he's the one that affords, you know, the fruits of alleged labor.  Yeah, and he just sits back and is just like, I don't give a fuck. 
[00:47:30]  I don't give a fuck.  See what that attitude got him?  A house.  Yeah.  See?  He's got a car.  He's got a nice house.  Inspection money.  He's out on fucking cruises and hanging.  Oil tanks all over his yard.  Yeah, he's worried about his oil tanks and, you know?  And it's like, meanwhile, like, tonight I'm pulling an all-nighter to DJ.  Tomorrow night I have to pull an all-nighter to DJ.  So I'll be up for three days in a row just to pay my bills.  Make ends meet, right?  Yeah.  Just to get some money coming in.  Yeah.  Just so I can have enough money to do what I got to do.  Some pocket money. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, you know.  But he'll come in late and be, like, grabbing his fucking nuts, like, fuck you guys.  I don't need to worry about this bullshit.  He got to a place in his career where he's enjoying the fruits of his labor.  There you go.  The fruits of his labor.  The fruits of his labor.  I hate that fucking...  It's the fruits of his labor.  Yeah.  Well, good for him, right?  Yeah.  With him, it's still like the pork chops of his labor.  Well, you and Sam, you know...  Fruits are too healthy.  You and Sam don't have the talent of E-Rock. 
[00:48:30]  Someday you will, and someday you guys will have a house, too.  I was actually talking to Troy about that the other day, that actually it's the reason...  I told him not to get upset that the reason that some people have more or whatever is because  the work that we do is of very little value, actually close to valueless.  Right.  So it's not...  That's why.  Did Troy express annoyance when that happened, like when he's at the house?  Oh, my God.  I didn't get a fucking house!  All right.  Let me break it down.  So you guys obviously think you're way more talented than E-Rock.  So if he's affording a house, what kind of house do you guys think you guys deserve 
[00:49:00]  at this point?  I mean, at this point, I'd just be so happy to pay my bills.  You know what I mean?  Like a house isn't even like...  They don't pay you either around here?  I mean, I don't know.  I'm asking you.  I don't really know.  I don't really want...  I would prefer not to go into it because, you know, they'll just...  They'll turn around to just be a...  Just go vague.  Oh, they'll bite you in the face.  Oh, they'll bite you in the face.  Well, since I don't care, apparently...  I love how they bite you in the face.  They pay a lot of people shit money, but then if you mention that you're being paid 
[00:49:30]  shit money, then it's your problem.  That you brought it up.  It's not to be spoken.  No, I understand.  Yeah, they really don't like that.  So if it's cool with you, I just would prefer to just...  They don't like it because it's embarrassing to everybody.  Well, I mean...  That's how little most people get paid around here.  I guess they should just...  They look at it like you should just be happy to have a job.  I guess that's...  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Hey, you should be thanking us that you have somewhere to go in the morning.  Yeah.  I think E-Rock's great.  He's a friend of mine, but if we're talking about...  Is E-Rock?  Yeah, yeah.  He's the best.  Sorry.  But if we're talking about...  That's nice to me.  ...who deserves what?  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  I mean, I feel like E-Rock's house that he bought should fit in the garage of the house  that I should be buying.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  That paints a picture right there.  Well, I love the guy.  Of course.  But I love him.  He's the best.  But I love him.  Well, E-Rock just knew how to save his money.  Is that what happened?  While you two live recklessly, E-Rock has been responsible.  E-Rock paid for stocking the company at $47 a share.  Oh.  Really?  Yes.  42.  Wait, you bought it on your own at 42?  All right, let's go over this again for the millionth time.  No, I don't remember this. 
[00:50:30]  I'm sorry.  No, it's just what the...  We go in cycles here.  So, when we got to XM, they have this employee...  Well, they had this employee purchase program.  So, you could buy the stock at a low discount closing price per quarter or something like  that.  Right.  So, I signed up for it and started buying stock at $42.  Option, right.  And it was going well.  It was going up into the 50s.  And then, you know, the 2005 going into 2006 happened and it started going down. 
[00:51:00]  And then the merger came and it just shit the bed.  Do you think you'll ever see it up at those levels?  Well, when I see people walking around here saying, oh, it's so great.  The stock's at $185.  I just want to throw shit at them.  Especially our bosses who tell us how great this is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's no concern.  Well, if you bought it at 60 cents, yeah, at $185, it's great.  They know how to spend stuff around here.  What's that about, man?  $1.85.  They ignore what it used to be.  Luckily, E-Rock owns multiple properties.  So, he's got investments in real estate. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, he does.  He does.  What about your home state of Florida?  You own any land down there?  No, no more.  Your father doesn't.  No more?  My father, yeah, he owns his house down there.  What happened to your condo?  I don't own that anymore.  You sold it?  You sold it.  It's transferred over.  You made a hefty profit, did you?  Money in the bank.  Yeah.  Money in the bank.  How much of that fucking New York Post lottery money do you still have?  Oh, that's, that was all gone.  That went into the condo.  That went into various comic cons for pocket money.  And wrestling belts.  So, that went into the condo.  Did he know you that he buys wrestling belts? 
[00:52:00]  I never bought a wrestling belt.  You have the fucking million dollar belt.  I have it.  I never bought it.  You walk around like, look at my fucking million dollar belt.  But he handles his pocket money.  It was a gift.  Virgil's fucking name on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, Virgil.  He knows how to spend his pocket money.  It's fucking money.  He's not wasteful with it.  You don't like that he buys trinkets?  With this, with this.  I want to know, you bought that condo with the lottery money from the post.  Yes.  And then you don't have the condo anymore.  Yeah.  So, you have to have some money.  No.  How?  Because I went in on it with family. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And now it's transferred over to my sister.  She has it.  But where's the fucking money that you put in?  Is there just a big kitty of Nagel money that everybody reaches into?  Yeah.  What about your share that you put in there?  You have some equity in that.  I do.  It's invested in other things right now.  He can just wipe his ass with his money.  He doesn't even know where his money is.  It doesn't matter.  That's crazy.  He knows he can buy a house, but it's like, I know I got all the money laying around.  He spent the $100,000 on the condo, and then he was like, well, I had the condo for a few years. 
[00:53:00]  You could just have it, I guess.  Have it.  I don't need the $100,000 back.  I got investments in other things I don't even know.  Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, and Nagel.  He's living high off the hog.  He's fine.  We don't have to worry about him.  Me a bag of shells.  How close are you?  I had it and went with it.  Easy come, easy go.  Troy, how close are you to buying a house?  Not even.  Like a year off?  No.  Not even.  You're shopping?  The market right now is good for the buyer. 
[00:53:30]  It's a pretty good market right now.  I'd be happy with software at this point for my computer.  Oh, boy.  Interest rates are low.  The home prices are down.  You might get a good foreclosure deal.  I'm thinking about buying a second home, matter of fact.  Oh.  Yeah.  I've been considering it.  Well, you're in the Nagel world, so.  The Nagelverse.  It's understandable.  It's a different deal.  Yeah, it's a Nagel thing.  Yeah.  It's a Nagel thing.  Whereas I took a picture of my television to display that I was watching a movie over 
[00:54:00]  the weekend.  Oh, yeah.  And all I got were tweets making fun of it for being a small TV.  You're a cheapskate, though.  You are.  He is a chiseler.  But you're a pinch penny.  His TV is uncomfortably small.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't even watch it.  It's like 32 inches.  Stop.  32.  What year is this?  That's a good TV.  That's a good size.  You've got to have something at least into the 40s.  Yeah, you've got to start in the 40s.  I'm not all in like that.  It's fucking, they're cheap.  Wait, not for Sam Roberts.  Yes, they are.  You're just a cheapskate.  I don't know. 
[00:54:30]  You're a skinflint.  You've got to spend some money on creature comforts.  You don't.  Or else you're going to, you know, you're going to lose that girl.  You're going to lose that girl.  You're going to lose that girl.  She's happy with the television.  If you don't buy her big TV, she's going to go to the compound.  She's going to go to the compound.  No, they're going to get a fucking, they're going to get a television bowl.  A guy's going to bring over like a 50-inch TV and put it there and just humiliate Sam's TV. 
[00:55:00]  And all they do is watch TV and Sam's got to watch his shitty little TV.  And then he's got to clean the screen when they're done.  Yeah, big black TV.  Big black plasma flat screen right in front of your little cuckolding television.  Jess is perfectly happy with the size of the night.  She doesn't care.  So you think.  She doesn't care.  So you think.  Size is everything with TV.  She does care.  Yeah.  But you know Jess is like, all right, Sam, when are you going to start fucking making that money?  Yeah.  She's had enough.  Because she's invested a lot into Sam.  She's along for the ride. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  And she's riding in an old Rambler right now.  And she's looking to, you know, someday be in that Cadillac.  Where's the payout?  Jess is in for the long haul.  Yeah.  She knows my gross earnings potential is high right now.  It's not high.  It's gross earnings potential.  You're on the downward spiral.  You've done everything possible for this company.  And they still ignore you.  I mean, I'm not saying in this company.  She looks like a girl.  You're going to have a means.  She looks like a girl that is comfortable with things that might be bright and shiny and,  you know, fast and loose. 
[00:56:00]  More importantly, a lot of people want to know what drug Troy's going to take to stay  up for three days.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not even.  So many people like they need to know.  How do you stay up for three days?  Just a lot of coffee.  Yeah, right.  It's just lies.  Oh, boy.  Maybe some Adderall.  A little Adderall.  That's what a lot of people are guessing.  What is Adderall?  Adderall is for ADD.  It helps you focus on stuff, but also kind of helps you sort of like keeps your mind going  where you can focus and do things. 
[00:56:30]  It's speed.  Oh, is it really?  It's the drug of the DJ.  I have a tough time focusing on stuff for a long period of time, so it helps me focus.  That's probably why you're not where Irock is, because he focuses.  Irock's good at focusing, Troy.  He's a good focuser.  Yeah.  He is.  He gets done what needs to get done.  And whether it doesn't matter if he needs to be here all night, he's here doing it.  It doesn't matter.  But he can do his job here and have his house inspected.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  And he's tweeting, making sure it's, you know, he's getting followers.  You know, that's important to him.  Good neighborhood in Iraq? 
[00:57:00]  Good neighborhood?  Very good neighborhood.  What are we, like, in the neighborhood of taxes, what are we looking at?  I think 9,300.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's not a bad neighborhood.  He doesn't want to give out too much info, because he doesn't want anyone breaking in and stealing  the Nagel seeds.  Oh, at night, milking out Nagel for the seed.  He'll go through his garbage outside his house looking for used condoms for some of that  seed.  Well, we heard that.  That valuable seed.  We heard that condoms are not being used in the Nagel home.  They pulled the gold.  Yeah.  In the Nagel home.  That's right. 
[00:57:30]  They did pull the gold.  Because we could have a little Nagel.  Yeah, liquid gold be all dumped out of that vagina.  Liquid gold.  Eric likes to hit it raw.  What can you say?  Yeah.  He's raw dog.  Eric doesn't want to deprive the world of another Nagel.  Why would you?  Oh, what do we got?  Wow.  Look at that house.  Oh, it's picture time.  That's a big house.  How many bedrooms?  How many?  Four bedrooms.  Four bedroom house.  Wow.  Look at that.  Four bedroom house that Iraq has worked for. 
[00:58:00]  He worked hard for that house.  To the victor goes the spoils.  Holy fucking living the great life in suburbia.  That's right.  The amount of people that Iraq has conned in his life.  Look at that.  I'm seeing a nice little archway into the yard.  Look at the...  What's this little...  What's this room off the side?  So proud of it.  A cake room.  A sunroom.  He has a sunroom.  You have any idea how many walls there are that can be covered with stuff that gets signed  by people who has no idea who half them are. 
[00:58:30]  By the way, I just saw the headline.  When Eric dies, eventually it's going to be in the sunroom.  He's going to have a fucking fatal heart attack in the sunroom.  In the sunroom.  Wow.  That is nice.  Yeah, it is.  Congrats, man.  Nice suburbia.  It's a nice tree-covered lane.  Now he's got to fill up that house with kids.  Oh, boy.  Kids and more autographs.  The walls are covered.  This guy put something on these walls.  With fucking Mr. Fuji's signature.  I've got to show everybody how great of a life I have. 
[00:59:00]  Ooh.  Wow.  Well, if it's greater than Troy's, then he's got it.  There you go.  You guys got some weird friendships around here, man.  I know.  It's all based on envy and materialistic shit.  Supposedly these two are friends.  Well, we've known...  Supposedly E-Rock and Roland are friends.  You would never know.  Eric and I have known each other for probably 13 years or something.  Wow.  E-Rock's bad with relationships because if Troy wasn't...  How many pounds was that converted?  He used to be thin.  If Troy hadn't known him back when, there's no way they would be friends. 
[00:59:30]  It's a friendship of just time.  Yeah.  And we have some history where it's like we've gone through some shit together.  We know some shit, so it's like, you know, I mean, I like him in that regard, but...  I think Troy hates Eric.  No.  I don't hate Eric.  No.  I do.  You just wish he worked harder?  Well, it just...  He's got that passion back in his eyes.  He just rubs it in your face that he just doesn't give a fuck.  You know what I mean?  That's...  And look at what it got him.  Yeah.  Take a look.  It's like, look.  Hey, check this out.  Read him in the week.  Look how great my life is, and look, I don't have to do shit. 
[01:00:00]  Oh.  It's better that way, though, Troy, if you think about it.  Yeah.  Why is that?  Because Victor goes to spoil.  Yes.  Look where we are.  It's better not to care.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock, a lot of people said not kitchens, bedrooms.  Oh.  So it's four kitchens and how many bedrooms?  That's right.  E-Rock makes the most of his opportunities.  Steve from Bayshore is saying everybody else on staff is hoping to nagle up someday.  Yeah.  Nagle up that next level where you can afford the house.  Keep it up with the nagles. 
[01:00:30]  Yes.  All right.  The nagles.  Thanks to Troy.  Thanks for your obvious jealousy.  Troy, get back, keep working hard, and maybe someday.  Maybe you can get that.  Maybe someday.  Five buck an hour raise.  Oh, yeah.  What do you rent a place?  What do you tease you with around here?  You rent a place?  Yeah.  What size is it?  A real small studio.  A real tiny studio.  A little studio?  It's probably about as big as this.  Is the bedroom the same as your living area?  Yes.  So you walk into the door, and you're in the bedroom. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  He said it's as big as this place.  Oh, boy.  It's probably about as big as this.  As big as our studio?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  With kitchen and bathroom.  Oh, man.  Included in this place?  Yeah.  So when you have people over, they're instantly in the bedroom.  I can't really have people over.  Oh.  Now, Nagels can entertain.  The Nagels will be entertaining like the Rockefellers.  They don't have companies staying there.  Oh, yeah.  There's a guest room.  How many do they have?  Three open bedrooms.  Four bedrooms.  Yeah.  And I just assume the rest of the country knows this shit, but when we talk about this,  people from around the country are amazed how we live in New York. 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  And shoeboxes.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you're not there a lot, so you can have a small place.  But this place is tiny.  And this is as big as your place.  Yeah.  But you don't need much room, really.  What if you're taking a chick over?  It's tough, man, because I don't have a...  Because it's very presumptuous to just bring her over and it's like, hey, here's my bed.  Yeah, let's sit on my bed to watch TV.  You want to have a couch.  Want to have meatloaf and fuck at the same time?  Wait, you don't have a couch because you don't really have a living room.  Right, I don't have room.  It's like literally my bed and then the wall is maybe 10 feet away. 
[01:02:00]  Why don't you get a bigger place?  Oh, man.  I mean, I could afford it if I moved back to one of the boroughs, but...  McNagel?  Troy.  If I'm DJing until 2.30, 3 o'clock in the morning and I have to be in here at 6.  Please tell the people out there how much you pay.  Please.  They're going to lose their minds.  For a tiny little studio, I'd pay $1,900.  Wow.  Holy shit.  That's not a lot.  You can do better than that for a studio.  Not much better.  You can move up.  In the mayor's house?  Where the fuck are you?  In the Upper East Side.  That's about... 
[01:02:30]  That's about...  What people are paying, Jimmy.  That's fucking crazy because let me tell you something.  About?  I'm right in Midtown.  Right in like off of Times Square.  One block off Times Square.  Sure.  And I'm paying $2,200.  And I have a living room, a separate bedroom, kitchen, bathroom.  Yeah.  One bedroom.  One bedroom in Manhattan in general is about $2,200.  Yeah, but it's like if you're going to pay that much, you might as well try to get just  the next $300 a month. 
[01:03:00]  You can't afford it.  That's what he's trying to say.  Well, I'm trying.  My lease is up in August and I've been DJing a lot more.  Come back on your hair gel money.  I've been DJing a lot more.  I'm hopefully going to start DJing a lot more than this.  You ought to go to BJing and make a little more money, huh?  That would work.  Like a real New York kid in this city.  Come on, suck a dick.  Well, why don't you ask Eric what he's been doing and try to emulate his life?  That's true.  We can all learn from Eric Nagel.  That's right.  Apparently not because I don't do anything around here.  Oh! 
[01:03:30]  How did you put together the Nagel fortune that allows you to buy this house?  Living in the lap of luxury.  Yes.  How did you figure out?  How did you go, wow, we have enough money in the bank, let's put the money down?  How did you get that?  Saving and some family help.  His family's very well-trained.  There's a bunch of people calling it Nagel Rich.  Oh, nice.  Are they Nagel Rich?  Oh, he's only Nagel Rich.  Did you sell the pretty cool hub boat?  That's been gone for years.  That's a tragedy.  Who got that money?  I think nobody would... 
[01:04:00]  Boats don't have a good resale value.  I think I had to have toad.  It was pretty cool.  It was in dry dock so long.  What a great way to go.  Hey, throw the boat away.  I don't care.  Fuck it.  What a great way to go to high school every day.  I know.  Look at him.  I bought a boat.  I was raised in Florida.  You get to go to fucking high school in a boat.  I bought a boat.  I got to take it to class for a couple years.  I had the car full on Long Island.  Let's just throw it in the garbage.  And then fucking, you know what?  These are hard to sell.  I'm just going to throw it away, the boat.  Get rid of it.  Boom.  Hey, by the way, $2,200 for one bedroom in Manhattan, $1,900 for a studio. 
[01:04:30]  Carolina, man, he's a regular.  I have a 2,400 square foot, four bedroom house on a half acre, two miles from the beach.  He pays $2,200 a month.  Yeah, see?  Yeah.  And look where you live.  Yeah, but it's just...  Exactly.  It's where you live.  Yeah, but is New York that great?  No.  Because I'll play that side of it.  But I have to live here because of the job.  This fucking city sucks.  I have to live because of the job.  Most of these people fucking suck.  If I retire and don't have to be in New York to do radio anymore, you think I'm fucking living here? 
[01:05:00]  I will buy a castle.  Believe me.  Someone explain to me why it's so great that you're paying $2,200 for a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan.  Exactly.  No, New York's not that great.  Well, you have everything at your fingertips.  You can do whatever you want.  It's New York.  Whatever you want.  Yeah.  I mean, it is an amazing city.  It's one of the best cities in the world, obviously.  But, you know, if you want to live in Manhattan, if you want to live in the...  Well, I mean, you've been here your whole life, so...  No, I was...  No.  Well, I mean, you've been in New York.  I mean, you would come into the city a lot.  I've been a New Yorker now.  Yeah.  Overpriced everything.  It's about 10 years now I've been a New Yorker. 
[01:05:30]  I grew up in the burbs.  So it's...  I want to be a suburb guy.  I love New York.  I love living in the city.  Government up your ass.  Everything's there.  It's annoying.  Having to jump through hoops to get a gun license.  Yeah, the New York screen.  But, I mean, as far as what I like it for, I just love being in the city.  Fucking love it.  I mean, if you're involved in the nightlife, it's great to...  I love the nightlife.  I like to boogie.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  On the disco...  What?  I don't know the next party there.  Yeah, something like that.  It sounds to me like Troy is getting turning green with Envy though for you.  Oh, my God.  He's just sitting on that for so long. 
[01:06:00]  Stupid chef.  She got a place in Westchester.  I got to say congrats to E-Rock on the house.  And I got to say, maybe you got to step your game up a little there, Troy.  You're slacking.  I know.  How big is your place, Sam?  One bed?  I have one bedroom.  How much a month?  It's like one and a half bedroom.  It's $17 a month.  So, it's still expensive.  Jesus.  And he's out of the city.  And you need a car.  Yeah.  I don't have a car.  Well, yeah, because then he has to throw his monthly parking on that.  And that probably puts him over $2,000 a month.  Yeah, my monthly parking is $325. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, I live with somebody.  People have apartments out of that much.  You and Jess split the rent.  Yeah.  She's had enough of this.  Oh, how does she just hang on to the likes of you?  I'm not in a position where I can afford to have somebody live.  Have a girl like that.  You're right.  Well, she can't be taken care of yet.  We're not at that.  I'm not at a nagle level where I can just take care of.  You can't care for your fucking girl.  That's right.  Not financially.  No.  This is terrible.  You're 28.  Yeah, you're 28.  He's not a kid anymore.  I was taking care of whores. 
[01:07:00]  There used to be a time.  There used to be a time.  She's not a whore.  I didn't imply that.  I implied the girls I was with whores.  I know.  I wish she was.  We'd have a shot at her.  That's the problem.  She's a nice girl.  Stupid, decent girl.  It sickens me.  There used to be a time when we were growing up, you did everything right for a company.  They took care of you.  Yeah.  Look at this.  And now we're at a stage where you do everything right.  You do everything they ask and more, and they still don't take care of you.  There's such a wealth disparity here.  It's unbelievable.  You guys ought to occupy E-Rock's office.  Look what was on my water bottle. 
[01:07:30]  If there's any question to Jess's devotion.  Oh, it's a fucking...  What does it say?  What is it?  She left a note on my water bottle in the fridge this morning before I left.  It's a little snowman.  First of all, why do you have those?  You can read it.  Those are for little tags you put on presents.  It's a little snowman.  It says, Sam, six more days till Christmas, you are loved with a little heart.  Oh, God.  Wait, now, is there any question?  She just has to reinforce that constantly to keep you fucking from thinking she's going  to leave?  I can't wait until he opens the fridge and he sees a fucking handgun with a sign that 
[01:08:00]  says, eat now.  Love.  Exactly.  Did you go to Christmas shopping for the lovely?  Yes.  I can't say too much because she might be listening.  Well, I know.  I don't want to give this up or anything.  By the way, that's a very subtle fucking sign what she just wrote.  She's had enough of him.  And she's had...  Wow.  You know, I didn't translate it like that, but let me hear your say. 
[01:08:30]  It says, you are loved with a heart.  Right.  She's had enough of him.  That's the subtle part, Sam.  And his nurturing mom.  And that's why she didn't say, I love you.  That's why she said, you are loved.  It doesn't mean by me.  No.  It's by mother and by other.  You are loved.  Like, she's stating a fact.  Ah.  I think she was implying by her.  She would have said, I love you.  It's faster.  Oh, Kenny just came in like Lenny and Squiggy.  Statement analysis that indicates distance. 
[01:09:00]  You are loved.  Distance.  That is distance.  Well, why would she write the note then?  Because she's trying to somehow...  String you along.  String you along.  She's waiting for a payday.  Well, she's not ready to walk yet.  She's waiting for something better to come along.  Yeah, she wants you to know that you are loved.  Which could be anybody on the screen.  You know, it can't be difficult.  What did you get her for last Christmas?  Let's go there.  What did you get her last Christmas? 
[01:09:30]  I don't remember.  I think last Christmas was a bunch of little things.  The Christmas before was a little necklace with a tiny diamond on it from Tiffany.  That's a nice gift.  Yeah, but that's crazy.  You can't be shopping at Tiffany.  You're not going to get your diamonds worth.  I know, but it was just like...  Where did they bring you for the tiny diamonds, by the way?  Oh, my God.  Because Tiffany's all about over the top.  It's like in the basement.  The elevator goes...  And you step out and you hear your footsteps in the dripping water down a cement hallway.  All the glitz is gone. 
[01:10:00]  Because they're grandiose over there.  I don't even know where you could find a tiny diamond in that joint.  Did it come in the blue box?  It did.  That was the whole point.  It was the least expensive stone in the entire store, but it came in the blue box.  Oh, man.  How tiny?  How tiny?  I mean, it was literal.  I mean, it's probably under a quarter carat at the most.  Oh, wow.  Like my engagement ring.  So the...  I don't even know what you call it.  It's much bigger than the...  Oh, yeah.  The setting.  The setting.  Thank you.  Was it a giant metal setting?  Yeah.  And I love when they take the setting and they facet the setting and then put the stone in 
[01:10:30]  the middle.  So it's like, look, the setting has facets.  You can barely tell where the diamond starts and ends.  It looks giant.  Yeah.  To compare.  Just because people...  I don't think people understand at home.  So you got the tiny diamond in the setting.  It's kind of like looking at E-Rock's belly button on his belly button.  Keep going.  Fuck.  Here's how you knew that was going to bomb because you actually...  You guys can't see.  But you leaned back on the mic and began doing the hand motion. 
[01:11:00]  Hand motion around the belly area.  So...  Is that it?  Yeah.  Except not those two diamonds.  Just the one.  Oh, just the one?  Yeah.  It's not that expensive.  Wait.  This is the actual necklace?  Without the two on the side.  Only the one in the middle.  You can't even see the diamond.  Just the one.  What's the point?  Might as well just have a regular chain.  It just looks like the necklace has a knot.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it looks like a kinked necklace.  It looks like...  Yeah.  No, it wasn't that big.  It was like that.  It wasn't that big.  Yeah, because see, that has...  You could actually see the diamond.  No, it wasn't this big. 
[01:11:30]  It was similar to this.  Was it gold or silver?  No, it was silver.  See?  Silver?  It wasn't even like platinum or white gold?  It was probably silver.  Oh, God.  What's the difference?  You know what?  It looks just like silver.  Fuck that Tiffany shit.  That's why you go to Steven Singer.  I know.  That's the last time I ever won anywhere.  And you do know that Steven Singer would have gave you a much bigger fucking necklace.  And I know we're not even doing a live read here.  I'm just telling you.  A lot of these people...  A lot of these places, I'm not saying that one in particular, but they do rip you off.  No, her finger's blinging now because of Steven Singer.  Oh, wow.  And that's something she could depend on, you know, hawking someday. 
[01:12:00]  Sure.  Why would she?  When you're ready to be out on the street.  Absolutely.  She's...  You are loved.  That is very distant.  You are loved.  That is a statement of fact.  And she was probably thinking about your mother nurturing you and you and your mother.  And she was just getting annoyed and she felt guilty she was annoyed.  So she wrote, you are loved.  And I'll bet you when she wrote it, she broke the pen tip.  If you look at the deed, there's probably a dark smudge.  She's like, you are loved.  And she just kept thinking about your hair and your Boy Scout and all your dumps that are  petrified in the closet.  You are loved.  And snapped at the end. 
[01:12:30]  Urek just reminded me, last Christmas was a very low-key affair because...  It was.  The engagement ring was on Thanksgiving and I let her know, you know,  Oh, that Christmas is going to be a little...  Yeah, that Christmas is going to be, you know, knock your socks off crazy.  So why don't you, like, wait for Christmas?  I know...  Or is that hack to get engaged on Christmas?  I don't know.  Did it on Thanksgiving.  Yeah, but...  No, because by...  Knowing that you couldn't give her the Christmas gifts, I'm wondering if you should just wait  until Christmas.  Because, number one, I did it in front of the whole family and it was a big to-do.  And, number two, when you get engaged on Christmas, the engagement ring becomes a Christmas 
[01:13:00]  present.  And should they...  Oh, then they don't have to give it back.  You know.  Should she finally find someone worth her fucking number.  So...  That's right.  Wow.  So, and this Christmas, is it good?  Yeah.  Is it a good year?  Is she going to be happy?  Yeah, she'll be happy.  There's no, like, marquee piece, but there's several pieces to make up.  Oh, God.  No marquee piece?  No.  No big gift?  Where you're like, oh, here it is, last one I give you.  There's no jewelry this year. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, my God.  She's probably, every year, she's getting her hopes up, like, this is the year he's going  to surprise me.  With something big.  And every year, she sees a bunch of little boxes.  Wrestling stuff.  Action figures.  Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it.  Yeah.  But there's shirt box size, and she's like, ugh.  Oh, I know what this is.  It's like the Van Heusen.  But her and my mother, Sam and my mother shop at the same places.  Yeah, they bump in each other at the Van Heusen store.  She got two wedding bands recently, so...  Like fucking puppies?  That's enough to tie it over.  No, they're not bands. 
[01:14:00]  No.  Enough with the wedding stuff.  You know, you've got to start thinking of just being nice and getting good shit.  Well, he's got to get married still.  Right.  So that's enough to tie it over.  Me, I'm the big prize this year.  In the coming year.  Oh, you're the big prize.  Sam will be married.  When is the wedding?  June.  June.  What a lousy gift for poor Jess.  What?  Whatever you're giving her.  No, I mean the wedding.  What do you think?  Ten years in, and if she doesn't hit pay dirt, you think she's sticking around?  I think she's very loyal, but I think that she, I think she feels guilty at how disgusted 
[01:14:30]  she is, because she's a really nice girl, but like she'll probably lay awake one night  and realize that she's fantasizing about him being killed, and go, like, oh wow, that's  terrible.  I get to start thinking.  Like she'll like, she'll realize she's smiling, and she'll be like, why am I smiling?  I was just thinking about Sam being hit by a car.  Oh, I should probably, I should probably not smile.  But you think most girls that...  Into the wedding or the relationship?  The relationship.  I'm thinking, most girls invest their time because they hope that there's going to be  a payout.  Future earnings potential, is what I call it.  Right.  So, what happens if that time never comes?  Do you think Jess will stay with you? 
[01:15:00]  Say you just have to live in almost poverty for another 20 years.  I don't see that as being an option.  But what happens if it is?  Do you think she sticks around?  No.  I don't know.  But I don't see it as being an option.  It's not one of my concerns.  Do you want kids right now or no?  Regardless of whether I wanted kids right now or not, that wouldn't be happening right  now.  I can't afford them.  Are you saying...  He's being responsible.  Are you wearing bags?  Unlike other people out there.  I always thought he was smart black, too.  You wear bags?  Right now, yeah.  You wear condoms in your relationship?  Right now, yes.  Oh, boy.  She's had enough of them. 
[01:15:30]  I couldn't do it.  Oh, God.  You wear a bag when you're...  Why don't you just pull out?  Well, okay.  It's not 100%.  All right.  Here's...  She thought if we started wearing bags again...  Yeah.  Then we stopped after the wedding.  It becomes special.  Wait a minute.  She suggested you start wearing them again?  Yeah.  When?  She's probably really pissed off that I just decided...  That's fair.  That's not that...  No, I don't think it's that bad.  When did she suggest this?  Well, she brought it up a little while ago, and then we enacted it. 
[01:16:00]  This sucks.  This is so personal.  A month or two ago.  Yeah.  But wait.  She said to you...  Yeah, it is.  We...  Oh, fuck.  She's going to kill you.  It's true, though.  Oh, no.  She said, I think we should start wearing condoms again.  So then after the wedding night, that'll be like, almost like a special night.  Did she see a sore on your lip or something?  Of skin on skin.  Or did you see a basketball jersey around the house?  No.  It's not that you just give up the ass after a wedding. 
[01:16:30]  That's the new start.  I don't know.  That's another road.  Yeah, it's true.  Exactly.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's right.  Yeah.  Once you're Mr. and Mrs. Roberts, it's fucking...  Give me that shit vent.  Shit vent.  So wait.  How did she bring it to you?  Did she go like, Sam, I want to talk to you?  Like, where were you guys?  How did that come up?  We were just at home, and she was like, I think this would be fun if...  And I was like...  Oh, fun.  Yeah, rubbers are real fun.  And then...  Yeah.  It's like one of those things of depriving yourself of something. 
[01:17:00]  How long ago did this happen?  The talk or when we actually started doing it?  Started doing it.  Probably a month or two at most.  You're enjoying it, are you?  It's horrible.  It's horrible?  It's terrible.  They're terrible.  Really?  It's really bad.  Come on, doll.  Sex only gets worse once you get married anyway.  That's why you start having affairs.  You know you're locked in.  Well, you're just at...  And it's, you know, like...  Listen to marriage expert, Troy.  Well, no.  Everybody here's been in a relationship where you're like, you're doing all sorts of crazy  shit, and then you're with a broad for a long time. 
[01:17:30]  She's not taking loads in the fucking face anymore.  Opie seems very happily married.  Yeah, I'm fine, Troy.  Well, I'm just saying, from my experience...  You're cynical.  You've never been married.  What experience?  But I feel like I've been married.  I've been in a relationship that felt like a marriage.  Absolutely.  Well, I'm six years into my relationship.  Boy, the condom thing is very weird to me.  Yeah, it wasn't my idea, and it's not fun.  Now, let's just say...  Wait, just to make it more special after you're married, though?  That doesn't make sense.  Cut the tips off of all of them.  Let your head get a little...  That doesn't make sense. 
[01:18:00]  Was she on the pill and said, I don't want to be on the pill anymore?  Because a lot of women...  Like, my girlfriend was on at one point, and then went off it because it was bad for her.  She's paranoid.  She's still on the pill.  She's on the pill, and she's making you wear bags?  Pills and condoms.  Wow.  Does she not want Sam's kids?  You are loved.  You are loved.  There's a lot of distance there.  Kenny was right.  Wow.  The pill, the condoms are great.  She's got a candy dish of morning after pills on the night table.  She just takes a mouthful.  Exactly.  You want to take the elevator?  No, no.  I'm just going to throw myself down the stairs in case. 
[01:18:30]  What do you think, Kenny?  Is she cheating on him?  What do you get for Christmas?  Abstinence?  What?  What?  That's so...  Go back out in the hallway.  That's terrible.  Just fall asleep in the hallway again.  Oh, shit.  I thought my belly button joke was bad.  Well, it was.  No, because the process is much more enjoyable.  Unprotected.  Yeah.  And so it's like...  But why wait for a certain day?  It doesn't mean anything.  Because it's like, let's forget how great it is and then re-remember. 
[01:19:00]  No, because you guys are living together.  It's not like you're living apart and then when you're married, now you're a couple.  You're fucking having sex for the first time.  This is that trying to make something of the wedding night.  Just stop.  Enjoy life now.  Yeah, like...  You lose your dick before your wedding day.  I hope not.  That would be awful.  Well, that would be awful.  But, you know, you should be using it now undeterred.  Wow, I don't really get that one.  No, I don't either.  It's to make it more special.  I understand. 
[01:19:30]  On the wedding day.  On the wedding night.  Trust me, your sex is going to be amazing.  So every time you have sex now, it's not as special.  That's right.  Why didn't you say no?  That's right.  That's right.  If I was with a girl and we had that talk and she was a little...  I would say, wow, no.  Oh, boy.  And then there'd be a big fight.  Well, Sam doesn't like fighting.  No, this is weird because a lot of couples will stop having sex...  Oh, that's stupid.  ...leading up to their wedding.  With each other?  But to continue having sex but in that way is just strange.  Why not just not have sex for a few months?  She must just really be into Sam Roberts. 
[01:20:00]  I don't know.  Oh, God.  Because people do that.  He knows it's weird, though.  He's questioning it.  Sam's a little bothered by it.  He knows.  No, I know.  No, the logic is a little strange.  It's weird.  Because she sat down and just talked to what she'd been thinking about.  Like, I want him to start using condoms again.  Maybe she thinks you're sowing your wild oats before you get mad.  Yeah, maybe she thinks you're cheating or maybe she's tempted and she wants you to get used  to it.  So, like, maybe whoever...  I like Jess a lot, but maybe she's seeing somebody who prefers to raw dog.  Better not be you, Eric. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, the nagle seed.  No, it's just because it's like depriving yourself of, you know, a food that you really  enjoy until a certain day and then it tastes better.  But then that's where you just don't have the sex.  I mean, you've got to have a little something.  A lot of people go down that road.  You've got to eat.  Once the wedding starts, I guarantee you, once the wedding starts, she might go, you  know, the kind of thing is good, though, because this way there won't be any mistakes.  Maybe she wants to come off the pill.  Maybe she's sick of taking the pill, but she would rather not have your kids. 
[01:21:00]  She's pretty honest.  She would probably just say...  She's honest, but she's like any other human being.  We're all delusional on some level.  All of us are.  She didn't realize that when she wrote, you are loved, that she's really saying goodbye.  It's very slow.  What does mother think about the condoms?  She's just finding out, I'm sure, listening at home.  Dad will tell her.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to hear what they were talking about today.  Watch him call him and go, Sammy, I'm still wearing them.  It's going to make for an uncomfortable Christmas Eve. 
[01:21:30]  It certainly would.  You want to call your mom, see what she thinks of this whole thing?  Nope.  I would bet she would think it's a little weird.  Yeah, well...  Oh, why, Sam?  She wouldn't like her, Sam's penis, feeling anything but...  The ultimate pleasure it could.  Warm, wet flesh.  Being all it could be.  She'd prefer not to think about my penis at all, I would think.  Well, you know, I mean, from just a practical point of view, not sexually.  Oh, you got really personal, too.  That's fucked up.  That's how I roll.  Rubbers and the pill is horse shit, Noodles is saying. 
[01:22:00]  Hmm?  Rubbers and the pill is horse shit.  Wow, you know what?  Why the pill?  I understand rubbers, but geez.  As long as she's on the pill, you could just knock a patch in there.  I don't understand rubbers.  Have fun.  Rubbers are stupid.  You just...  Oh.  Yes.  Might as well stick an IUD in there also.  Ha ha ha, right?  A frisbee.  Right?  And I like the frisbee.  Yeah, frisbee.  Yeah.  Okay.  Go with the frisbee.  That sperm's got to go through the beginning of Get Smart to get to the fucking egg.  No kidding, man.  Holy fuck. 
[01:22:30]  Do you have to use a dental dam when you eat it?  Ah, a dental dam.  A dud what?  A dud dud.  It's not about the protection of it.  It's about the feeling.  Yeah.  That it's depriving you of a certain feeling that you'll regain once you're married.  All right.  So that wedding night will be special.  Oh, yeah.  We'll find out.  But I've told her because of this, I won't last.  Oh, he's going to shoot too soon.  On the wedding night, I mean.  He's going to have premature cumzies.  I'll be so excited.  Then do it again. 
[01:23:00]  Wait a minute.  Just do it again.  I have to jerk off.  How long do you...  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, sad.  We just figured it all out.  She's trying to...  Could you wear three condoms, please?  Could you wear a sock and a rubber band?  Oh, no.  Oh, now it's uncomfortable.  Now we can't even look at him.  He's not fucking long enough for her to...  She's sick and tired of him stopping so soon.  She's hoping the condom will help. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, no.  She's just making an excuse for the wedding night.  Quick drama growl.  How long do you take, for real, without a condom?  Without a condom?  For real.  I mean, on a good day or a quick day?  A quick day.  On a quick day, you're not looking at more than three minutes.  Is he lying?  Oh, boy.  On a quick day?  How about with a condom?  With a condom.  I mean...  The sky's the limit.  Yeah, I mean...  That's what it is.  It's all about pacing.  Oh.  You've got to pace yourself.  That's what it is.  He's taking too long.  You've got to know how to edge a little bit.  Chill out a minute.  Oh, boy.  There'll be times with a condom where it's just, this isn't working. 
[01:24:00]  You just got to have horrific...  You've got to have horrific thoughts in your head that can sit there, right on the back  shelf, and be brought forward at a moment's notice.  Sure.  And then you're just like, ah!  Not enough to lose your rod, though.  You know, it's a fine line.  What do you do when you lose your rod in the condom?  Just pull it off and go look.  Yeah.  Flap.  Flap.  What does she say?  She mad?  No, because then I blame it on the condom, and that was her idea.  Blame it on the condom.  And then what happens?  Do you try to get... 
[01:24:30]  Spitting your hand, let's say, what's worked this puppy up to its percentile?  Going again with another condom?  What's going on?  Depends.  Sometimes we'll stop and then start again, and then sometimes it's just, it isn't working.  It's like work.  Television.  Oh, once you're watching television and she hasn't been brought to that special place.  You're overthinking shit.  Yeah, there's problems at the Robert's bedroom.  You're overthinking stuff, man.  But if it works out for you, good for you.  Whatever.  But sometimes it's fine with the condom.  Sure, sure.  Yeah, sure.  Sometimes, sure.  There's problems in the Robert's bedroom. 
[01:25:00]  There's no problem.  She's trying to work this out before the wedding.  He's like, can I get him to go longer?  I can't do this.  Oh, God.  She's satisfied.  I think.  No!  Who could be sure?  Any time with a condom, you know what you have to do?  What?  Say you're going straight missionary.  You know, her legs are on the outside.  Yours are on the inside.  You're just going to do a dot, dot, dot with a condom.  You've got to sometimes do a little push-up, get yourself up, and then grab her legs and  fucking knock them in together and put your legs on the outside.  Right.  Now, she's got her legs pretty much closed. 
[01:25:30]  You're in the tightest possible position you could be in.  I see what you're saying.  And then it works with a condom because now you're working with the, it's almost like  jerking off with the slide motion or the grip.  The grip and rip.  That's more of a grip and rip.  That's a great idea.  It works.  And it pushes everything.  Everything gets slammed on your dick.  Squeezed up real tight.  And you're, yeah, yeah.  That's a great idea.  That works good.  That's a great idea.  It does work very well.  Yeah.  How premature. 
[01:26:00]  It's not premature.  Do you make cumsies when you kiss her?  No, I've never done that.  Three minutes.  His dick has to go right into an incubator.  That's how premature it is.  He's got preemie.  Do you, uh.  There are quick days, but there are days that it's like, okay.  But you're not a dirty talker.  No.  You're not a spanker.  No.  I mean, I have spanked, but not as a regular practice.  There's just nothing going on in that bedroom.  He just climbs on like, you climb on the way a child does when it wants a teat.  Oh.  You could broadcast that on Nickelodeon, you guys having sex. 
[01:26:30]  That's how undirty it is.  You said horrific thoughts, right?  Yeah.  IGD66 on Twitter.  Hmm.  What kind of thoughts does Ant think is horrific?  Empty keg?  No ammo?  Uh, those are two of the horrific thoughts.  Those are two of your horrific thoughts?  Other ones include some people of certain racial backgrounds.  He puts on jungle fever to keep from coming.  So, uh, yeah.  Sam needs to be dirtier.  Yeah.  You need to extend the lovemaking a little bit.  I think that's what's happening is it's too short.  You are loved.  Sounds like an old fucking English butler saying that to you. 
[01:27:00]  You're marrying Hobson.  Hobson.  So, we should give your mom a call.  She'll give you some tips.  Terrible idea.  Some pointers.  I'm going to talk to Jess.  I would hope that by now she's turned off the radio.  No, she's very, uh, invested in your life.  What do you wonder?  When I see my mother again, if she'll pretend she never heard this or if she'll address it.  And she's probably, they've talked about it while they're out shopping.  I'll tell you what Jess is saying.  Does the father come quick too?  And she's like, oh no, he's a horse.  Oh no, it's amazing.  Is Sammy coming quick again?  Again? 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  How embarrassing.  It's not, it's not what it is.  All right.  Why don't we, uh, break it?  She needs something dirty.  You gotta be dirtier, Sam.  She's a cool girl.  Yeah.  Thank you, Troy.  Thanks, man.  Adderall, man.  Yeah.  Think about that house.  You're working toward that.  Look at the goal.  Look at the goal.  How much money you got in the bank?  Get out of that word.  How much money you got in the bank?  Ah, the bank account.  Not even worth mentioning.  Come on in.  Come on in.  How much?  No, no, no, just, I mean, honestly, right now?  Yeah.  Two million?  I don't know.  I'd probably have like a thousand bucks. 
[01:28:00]  Jesus Christ.  Eric, is that more or less than you have in the bank?  Jesus Christ.  That's less.  Oh.  That's less.  He answers it.  That's less.  Poor E-Rock.  A thousand bucks in the bank.  Poor E-Rock, though.  You're right.  So I'm excited to have money for that.  Poor E-Rock.  Where are you going?  I'm going to California.  Where are you going?  My one chick.  Did your other chick know about it?  Yeah.  Did she like it or no?  I mean, she's not happy about it, but she understands.  How many chicks you got?  Right now I'm with two.  But he's honest with them.  Yeah.  Which one do you like better or do you not have a choice? 
[01:28:30]  Fantasy.  They're both completely different.  How do they accept that?  These are two really cool chicks.  You're willing to share a Troi Kwan, I think.  Well, it's weird because I'm trying something different.  I'm actually being really honest with both of them about everything.  About every single thing.  Bank account?  Well, I mean, that's not what I'm trying to be honest about, but you'll lose one.  Yeah, and which one's going to stab you in the middle of the night?  Well, one of them.  Because she makes believe she's cool with all this.  Because she finds the other girl's panties.  And then you wake up because a knife is being plunged into your chest. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  One of them knows that long term isn't going to be for her.  Because she's interested in a family and marriage, and that's not what I'm interested in.  Where the other one just got out of a horribly abusive marriage, so she's perfect for me.  Sure.  Because she just doesn't want to get wrapped up in another marriage.  Which one are you going away with?  The marriage, the ex-married one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mrs. Roberts.  Oh, shit.  I didn't call her, Sam.  I did not call her. 
[01:29:30]  Good morning.  Your pal E-Rock did.  You mean rich E-Rock?  All fat pockets?  This is Roberts.  How are you today?  Exactly.  Fat stomach.  How are you guys?  We're enjoying Christmas cookies from someone else today.  Yeah.  But that's not why we called.  No.  Don't.  We're calling about relationship things with Sam.  And I don't know.  We've got some info that's a little troubling.  Yes.  Between Sam and Jess.  And we'd rather tell you instead of maybe you finding out another way. 
[01:30:00]  Have you been listening to the show?  I've heard a little bit of it.  You should hang up now.  Oh, boy.  No, no, no.  Just hang up.  No.  Don't be polite anymore.  No.  I'm prepared to hang up soon.  No.  Please hang up.  You don't have to hang up, Ms. Roberts.  We're not being rude.  And don't ever.  And if you don't hang up, never talk about this off the air.  Ever.  It seems Sam is using a prophylactics now with Jess, with the lovely Jess, because they  want it to be a little more special on the wedding night. 
[01:30:30]  See where they will do it sans, you know, prophylactic.  And that's going to make it special.  You see how unnecessary this is?  But we then found out that Sam seems to be able to continue the pleasure a little longer  with a condom on than when he is not wearing a condom.  Why would she wear?  And we think that's why Jess wants him to wear the condom, just so it lasts longer, instead 
[01:31:00]  of being what they call a one-pump chump in the bedroom.  And then Opie over here laughs, oh my God, can you believe these guys, after he's the  one who picked up the phone knowing exactly where this would go?  I thought they'd be a little more subtle.  I wanted to get to the point, but keep it a little classy.  You've been out with Jess, Ms. Roberts, you've been out with her.  Has she indicated dissatisfaction in that area?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Do you guys realize how grossly inappropriate? 
[01:31:30]  It's horrible.  Yeah, thank you.  You girls talk about, you know, a little bit, maybe not dirty-wise, but you guys discuss  some of the gentleman's sexual prowess.  I'm sure you tell Jess about Mr. Roberts and how fat it is.  You know, it's just girl talk.  We understand.  It's just girl talk.  At the club?  Yeah, at the club.  This is what they discussed at that one.  So when you're talking with Jess, does she bring up Sam at all? 
[01:32:00]  How fat it is.  Oh, how turgid it is.  She does not bring up their intimate life.  No?  No.  That does seem odd.  Has she complained about Sam occasionally being done too quickly or not being able to  maintain his turgid state with a prophylactic?  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  No?  Okay.  And so then you were completely unaware of the fact that Sam might have what they call  a sexual problem. 
[01:32:30]  Who are you texting?  Who do you think I'm texting?  Okay.  No, I'm wondering if they...  I'm not aware of any problem like that at all.  Well, it's there.  Has she complained like, well, Sam will sometimes lose it in the middle and you have to go, oh,  God, his father certainly doesn't.  It would stay rock hard during a tsunami.  Do you discuss that with her?  No.  Oh, boy.  We don't mean to be disgusting.  We're just concerned with Sam's relationship because he's not, we're afraid that Jess is 
[01:33:00]  unhappy in that area.  She's fine.  There's nothing to be worried about and you don't, mother, mother, mother, mother, blood  talk about this.  Mother, mother.  We love Sam and we want him to be happy and we love Jess, but we're concerned that he's  a real snooze in the bedroom.  Yeah, yeah.  There might be.  And you know what happens if the sex life, it's not everything.  I know that, but it's a big part of being married and we just want his marriage to be  successful and I'm sure, as I'm sure you're, you do. 
[01:33:30]  So what, what advice would you give Sam to keep his cock hard?  Don't even address it.  Why wouldn't you just hang up?  No, you don't want to hang up.  That would be rude.  She loves the airtime.  I bet she's not going to hang up.  The key is probably like a crackers and buttermilk.  That just seems very happy to me.  Seems.  Well, how about, how about this?  Laughter behind the tears or.  What did you and Mr. Roberts do leading up to the wedding night?  Right. 
[01:34:00]  How did you make it special?  Did you guys change some things around?  Oh, yeah.  What did you do?  To make your wedding night a little special?  Don't answer.  So who sent cookies in today?  My wife.  That would be Paul's mom, who is now the baking champion of the show.  It was Paul who just called me, actually.  What?  It was Paul who just called me.  I should have said something to him.  Hey, did you, um, were you trying to have children right after you got married?  No.  No?  You waited a while, huh? 
[01:34:30]  Now, what types of precautions were used when you two were wacky kids just, you know, trying  to enjoy each other's pleasure?  That is so none of your business.  Nah, you know what?  It kind of is everyone's business now.  It's opened up.  I agree.  Things about sexuality and birth control and stuff, it only helps people now, and I'm  sure you want to help other people like that.  You're a good woman.  What types of birth control were used back in the day? 
[01:35:00]  I just say don't do it.  Oh, abstinence?  Yeah.  I don't believe that.  I'll say this nicely.  She's saying don't do it there.  Oh.  But there are other options.  There are other options.  Okay.  So there are other options.  Mrs. Roberts, to vaginal intercourse that would keep you from being pregnant, but still  make sure that the hubby doesn't leave the nest for pleasure elsewhere.  I don't know if all the cookies that Paul brought in are actually homemade. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah?  Why?  Why, really?  Do you think you got some at the store?  Some of them seem store-bought.  Why?  And then mixed in with the homemade ones?  Yeah.  Why would she take the pill and use a condom?  We don't get that.  We don't understand that.  That seems a little like she really doesn't want to have the Roberts child.  She does not want to give you a grandchild.  What's your thoughts on that?  You have to have a thought on that.  Why both?  Are they sugar cookies?  Would you like a grandchild from your son Sam? 
[01:36:00]  That's an easy question.  Sometime when they're ready.  When they're ready.  Now, what would you consider ready, though, knowing Sam and Jess?  When they're ready.  What does ready mean?  Ready mature-wise?  Ready financially?  It's their call.  Whatever's right for them.  Oh, so if they wanted to have one tomorrow, you'd be fine with it.  It's totally up to them.  So he'd have to pull that condom off, though.  Do you put a dinner roll in the box of cookies to, what, for moisture? 
[01:36:30]  Because there's a dinner roll in here, and Obie was saying it might be to preserve moisture.  Jess is going to need a dinner roll in her pants with Sam being his un-fucking...  What kind of dinner roll?  Satisfying.  Satisfying.  It's literally, it's like a bread.  That's a little baking trick that keeps everything moist.  Look at this chocolate chip cookie, how moist it still is.  They are moist and soft.  Does that work?  Oh, no.  I like, for Christmas, I like a crispier cookie at Christmas.  Well, we wouldn't know that now, would we?  A crispier cookie at Christmas. 
[01:37:00]  A crispier cookie, by the way, that's the problem we think Sam is having, is cookies not  staying crispy.  Oh, his cookies aren't staying crispy.  Sam's cookies.  But they're not Christmas cookies.  They're like chocolate cookies, chocolate chips.  It doesn't matter.  Your mom didn't bring, your mom didn't make cookies for us.  Well, she was going to, but then you called her and asked her these questions.  I didn't say anything.  I've been very reserved.  People have noticed how reserved I've been.  These are perfectly fine questions to ask a mother about her son and future daughter-in-law.  Of course they are. 
[01:37:30]  Where do you live?  The 50s?  Well, this isn't leave it to beaver.  This is, you know, we're going into 2012 over here.  It's open talk and honesty.  Let the record state that we wouldn't even know this.  You decided to share this today, Sam.  Yeah, he actually told us first that he's got to wear three condoms in order to stay  rigid.  That's not what I said.  And it even made me go, holy shit, this is real personal.  I'm not.  She just got tired of Sam's inadequacies.  Yeah.  I was going to spend my entire day today making nice treats for you guys. 
[01:38:00]  Thank you.  We're trying to help Sam.  Speaking of treats, is that what happened before the babies?  After the wedding?  What were you thinking about making?  Just cookies or fudge, too?  Does it trouble you that Sam has to use a splint on his dick like a Civil War leg wound homemade  fudge or what type of fudge?  Like what type of fudge, cookies, stuff like that?  Yes.  Maybe you could pack the condom with fudge and this way it would cut down on sensation.  And make pecan tarts.  And look the right color.  And other baked goods. 
[01:38:30]  I thought some pecan tarts would be good.  How's cunnilingus with a handlebar mustache?  Oh, my God.  You have pecan tarts?  Pecan tarts?  Yeah.  It's cool.  You have one as a son, too.  I'm kidding, Mrs. Roberts.  I like your mom.  Yes, Mrs. Roberts.  We're joking.  Always a pleasure talking to you.  Obviously, we're not going to get any info that we want out of here because you're kick  it old school.  But ask her about Sam and the amount of money he makes here. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, what about Sam's pay here?  Now, we've learned E-Rock.  You know Eric, right?  Yeah, I know Eric.  Eric is buying a house.  E-Rock is buying a house.  That's how well he's doing around here.  And we look at the way E-Rock works and we look at the way Sam, your lovely son, works  very hard here.  And he can't afford that house.  He can't afford a TV.  He can't afford a room in the house.  He can't afford a room.  He's just the disparity between pay of these two gentlemen is a little much.  Josh, what's your take on that? 
[01:39:30]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.  And you guys have to tell management that.  Oh, we do.  Oh, trust me, we do.  How about I take care of my own friggin' self first and try to get money out of them  from me?  I can't afford to heat my pool the whole season.  That must be tough.  You know how hard that is?  Sure.  We had a discussion on Friday, me and Jimmy and some of the bosses around here.  Yes, we did.  About your son's valuable contribution.  Yep.  We did do that.  It would be really nice if management recognized that. 
[01:40:00]  And I'm sure they're going to sue him.  No, they're not going to sue him.  Not at all.  Standing on his way out.  Showing it doesn't matter what you do for a company.  Right.  And nobody appreciates a man who can't keep an erection.  I can.  And the company knows that.  When it just withers away because the rubber doesn't fit, it's not sensitive enough for  him.  And then if there's not, we found out if it's not on, he's very sensitive and then he  can lose it in three minutes.  Mrs. Roberts, your son giving his future wife three minutes of pleasure is not cutting it. 
[01:40:30]  You've got to understand that.  That's twice as much pleasure as he gives on the after show.  Now, we talked to management about Sam and they said that any man who can't take care of  things in the bedroom can't be trusted in a company.  And that's the feelings around here.  Is that why E-Roc's done so well?  Because of the sexual prowess of Eric Nagel?  Yes.  The sexual prowess is legendary.  Because Eric is so heavy and he's got a big thick one.  And he just lays on and just allows his big hips to collapse in like a Deuteron star.  What do you call your semen?  I don't have a name for it. 
[01:41:00]  Well, that's your problem.  Like Precious Prince Nagel Seed.  Apparently garbage.  She doesn't want anyone near her.  Yeah.  Prince Nagel Seed.  Keep that off of me.  Does she go, ew, when it hits her anywhere?  First of all, I will, any answer to that question, the implications.  Does she shake her hands and go like, eeeh?  Can she get a towel?  She's tired of it, right?  No.  Yeah, the second you're done, does she just go, repeat, give me a towel, give me a towel,  give me a towel.  Is it anything like that?  No.  My ex-girlfriend took the goose.  She knew better. 
[01:41:30]  She liked it?  Fuck yeah, she liked it.  I don't care.  I like when they just kind of wallow in it like a pig in a stomach.  I just wallow.  I like when they root around in my gum with their nose.  Like she's looking for truffles.  Ms. Roberts, you still there?  I feel like we're really resorting to base level humor.  No.  Well, it happens.  When did we ever go above that?  Mrs. Roberts?  Are you going ahead with this conversation without me? 
[01:42:00]  I was just making sure you were still on the line.  That's all.  That's all.  What are the plans for today?  What are the plans for today?  What's going on with the iPad over there?  I don't know.  Today, making treats for you guys.  I can hear it.  Making treats?  What about Christmas?  Christmas a big thing around the Roberts house?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, it's a big deal.  And what are you going to cook up a turkey and Dad's going to cut it?  No, no.  We don't do turkey for Christmas.  Oh, what do you do?  Holiday ham? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, we do ham on Christmas Day.  Oh, that sounds nice.  We'll probably do like roast chicken or something Christmas Eve.  Oh, that sounds good.  Wow.  A lot of family over?  The iPad is still on.  What is that?  Some of Jess's family is coming for Christmas Eve.  Oh.  The in-laws are coming over.  The in-laws.  Well, that's interesting.  Yes.  Do you spend much time with the in-laws?  Me?  Yeah.  I do, yeah.  But the whole family now, together, is that going to be a little awkward? 
[01:43:00]  Is there one that's a drunk or?  No, it'll probably be all right.  My dad doesn't like having company, but he pretends.  Oh, boy.  But he hates Jess's family.  No, no, no.  His father hates Jess's family.  To tell.  He hates most families.  And they consent it.  He hates most families.  Yeah.  Really?  Does he?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He hates.  But he'll be nice to them regardless, despite disliking.  For his boy.  For his boy.  He likes them as people.  He does.  But he doesn't like having people over.  He doesn't like going over to people's houses.  Well, because you guys are very traditional.  Shut in.  Yeah.  Is he going to be.  Exactly.  What does he do?  Is he going to be reading that story again this year? 
[01:43:30]  He reads three stories.  What stories does he read?  I forgot.  You don't remember?  He reads Christmas stories, even though everyone's pushing 30.  Oh, God.  He reads the Polar Express.  It makes sense when they're eight.  He reads the Polar Express.  He reads How the Grinch Stole Christmas.  Oh, boy.  He reads Twice the Night Before Christmas.  Does he really get into it?  Like, does he put on the voice and stuff?  And then he said, why do you think I?  Does he have a costume?  No, no costume.  For his reading? 
[01:44:00]  No.  And then he also reads the original story of Christmas from the Bible.  What?  Who tolerates this shit?  I know.  It's a tradition.  You guys.  Get up and walk out.  How long does this take?  Walk out.  Like it's a club.  I was trying to.  Get up and walk out.  If he started that towards the night, he'd hear, boom.  How long does it take?  Probably about a half hour.  That's it?  Yeah.  I mean, these are short stories.  What do you all do while he's doing it?  I want to know.  Sit there and listen.  No, you don't.  Intently.  And do you have to look at him like and nod like, yeah, yeah, that Grinch. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That creeps.  Mrs. Roberts, have you had it with the story readings?  No, no.  That's a good tradition.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I like the airing of grievances.  Yeah.  How about the tradition just started, though?  That's the one we're concerned with.  Yes, that tradition.  We get it.  We've moved past it.  She wants to keep Sam's herpetic seed away from her.  Herpetic.  I don't have herpes.  No, no.  We know that.  I don't have any STIs.  STIs?  Sexually transmitted infections is what they're called now. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, why not a disease?  I don't know.  How do you get rid of that D?  Generation now calls them STIs.  Not that you've got to worry about that with the fucking tarpaulin you're wearing over  your dick.  That's right.  Exactly.  I'm sorry, Mr. Roberts.  Uh-oh.  I wonder if that's what happened.  Nobody.  I wonder if there might be a little something that might have happened while Sam was away  with me.  Oh, no.  Maybe before that.  Oh, no.  Maybe she saw an old flame.  Oh, boy.  She didn't see any old flames.  Like the old lady in the elevator. 
[01:45:30]  Hey, it's an old flame.  It's just horrible.  That is terrible, but what are you going to do?  That's the type of person you are, though.  Terrible.  Terrible.  All right.  Let's, uh, Mrs. Roberts.  Goodbye, Ms. Roberts.  Thank you for calling in and just talking about this.  She wanted to just hear about it, so she called in.  Help, Sam.  Bake some Viagra into those cookies.  Some Cialis.  Exactly.  Cialis and oatmeal.  We'll only give them cookies when they're covered in cellophane.  Make them eat those.  Yeah, let Jess, let him know how Jess feels.  No pleasure whatsoever.  Yeah, that's not true.  Yeah, it is.  This is really a good time. 
[01:46:00]  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Sam doesn't talk dirty either.  We're concerned about that.  Yeah.  No dirty speak at all.  No.  Like, I'm not a fucking, you know, yeah, you bitch, fuck me, you fucking bitch.  But every so often, you know.  I feel like an asshole as I'm dirty talking.  Do you?  Yep.  You're not good at it?  You feel uncomfortable?  You got to get your comfort level up.  I think I do.  It usually helps with booze.  I think I have to work on being a more open person.  Do you think so?  Yeah.  Because it's, talking dirty is fun.  I mean, if you're both into it, it's like, it's your chick.  It's comfortable. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  But you can't just be silent.  What do you want to talk about, but you don't?  There has to be something you want to say.  I'm not even, no, I'm not even there.  Like, I'm not stopping myself from talking.  I'm just not.  Don't whisper to it.  Even something like this.  Like, this wouldn't be considered, like, dirty talk where you would think, like, oh,  God, this stuff.  But it's like, yeah, I want to fucking eat your ass.  I want to fucking eat your ass.  Something like that.  No.  Why wouldn't you say that?  Give her a little warning.  What's coming?  Hey, by the way.  Yep. 
[01:47:00]  Ass eating.  Ass eating will commence in three minutes.  You will get out of your belly.  And spread your legs.  Spread your asses up in the air.  The tongue is coming.  I can fucking talk dirty.  No, I just don't.  It's not something that comes naturally to me right now.  Oh, Sam.  I'm fascinated with this.  Yeah.  I feel Sam.  Oh, Sam.  I feel insincere.  Oh.  What do you think when you're having sex?  Like, because I'm so, I used to fuck my girlfriend and I would be so jealous that, like, she would 
[01:47:30]  be, like, zoned out and enjoying it or my ex before her.  And I'm like, what's happening with you right now?  I feel lost.  I'm by myself in this.  If they're enjoying it?  Yeah.  Or if they're just, like, enjoying quietly, like, the feeling of it.  Like, for me, it's so hard for me to stay in it.  Well, I think that's because you've also had much more experiences than most of you have.  Or just an addict.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But what are you doing when you're having sex?  Are you looking at her?  Looking at her.  In her face?  Her eyes?  Her face, her eyes. 
[01:48:00]  Do you kiss her?  Oh, yeah.  And what are you thinking?  There's not much.  How am I getting this?  Yeah.  I mean, half the time it is stuff like that.  Like, holy shit.  Damn.  She's way out of my league.  Yeah.  And that's why you won't really open up because you're just hoping, like, she doesn't, she doesn't  catch a glimpse of you and think, like, oh, I didn't see that part of him.  I'm out of here.  No, I'm very myself around here.  I don't think you're very confident.  It's been six and a half years.  Do you guys have loving sex?  Like, you'll, like, love each other?  Yeah.  Both.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jimmy looks at that, like, awful. 
[01:48:30]  Literally.  He goes, like, ew, loving sex.  If he told me we played basketball while we fucked, I would relate more to that.  Really?  Yes.  You've never had loving sex?  Not with a non-prostitute.  Well, what?  It's the opposite of what I like.  So you like having loving sex with a prostitute?  Or an inappropriate person.  Wait, not without a non- wow.  Really?  But, like, a girlfriend, you can't-  No.  No.  Why not?  But I'm a loving guy because during this-  You've been in love, haven't you?  Sure.  And I loved my ex very, very much.  And I would tell her I loved her a lot. 
[01:49:00]  But I would kiss her and tell her I loved her and lay with her, just not while we fucked.  So when you have sex with a girlfriend, it just has to be dirty.  You don't like gentle touching during sex?  Gentle touching's great.  Okay, but that's kind of considered loving and kissing in certain places.  Loving sex with a prostitute?  I'm really confused.  Or a girl I don't know that well.  You don't have to talk and be like, I love you.  I love you.  Wait, wait, wait.  I love you.  But what's-  What is the definition of loving sex with a prostitute?  Because it's inappropriate to tell a prostitute that you love her.  Oh, I got you.  It's inappropriate to be loving. 
[01:49:30]  Isn't it inappropriate to be with the prostitute?  Let's start there.  Yeah, let's just start right there.  I like the opposite like that.  But with a girlfriend, I have great sex with my ex.  We'd fucking talk dirty.  She was-  She just got it.  Like, oh, fuck, man.  So everything has to be like naughty.  Like, we're not supposed to be doing-  There was some-  But not even boyishly naughty.  Dirty.  Dirty.  But it doesn't have to always-  But you can't have both in a relationship?  Dirty sex and then some loving sex?  You can, but to me-  No, I mean you.  No, no, but the loving stuff, for me, doesn't do it sexually. 
[01:50:00]  Like, I'm thinking of my ex and how much I enjoy it sexually, and I couldn't picture  telling her I loved her while we fucked.  Wow.  Wow.  How did this go from Sam's premature ejaculating limp dick to Jimmy Norton?  Because we both-  I'm fascinated-  This is why I ask these questions.  I'm fascinated by other people's sexual-  Yeah.  What they can get off to.  Like, I couldn't comprehend coming like that.  Like, I couldn't do it.  But I think the average guy could have both.  Maybe you're right. 
[01:50:30]  They could have the dirty sex and the loving sex, and they both are pretty damn cool.  It doesn't even have to be dirty.  It's just-  Well, what happened then?  You can't have that.  I'm confused.  Um, you just-  When you-  The times where I couldn't-  Some kind of a ritualistic creature.  If I was 69-ing on the bottom, we wouldn't be talking.  Like, what would turn me on is, like, the smell of her pussy would turn me on.  It was like that.  But if we're just having regular sex, whether it's her in her stomach or me behind her or  whatever, or missionary, when she would-  I feel really weird when there's love involved with the sex. 
[01:51:00]  Wow.  Really weird.  Um, if, like, she would-  Even my ex, who was dirty.  But if we were laying there not having sex, and she kissed me and said, I love you, like,  I would say, I love you, too.  Or I would say it first.  Like, it was new.  I was not afraid of being loving.  I think it's important to have both.  You're probably right.  I think a lot of people make that mistake.  You're probably right.  That it's either got to be, you know, all lovey-lovey.  Well, yeah, there's a time and place for everything.  Except condoms.  You just want to get, you know, you want to get dirty.  I'm not balanced like that, though.  I envy people that can do that and have healthy sex. 
[01:51:30]  Gotcha.  But I can't comprehend not having the dirty part.  But Sam can't have the dirty part.  You can't have the loving part.  No, no, no.  I just don't dirty talk.  You don't spank either.  Oh, God, Kenny.  Ah, Kenny.  My wife wanted me to spice up our love life, so I poured hot pepper seeds in her pussy.  Jesus.  I don't think he really did that.  I don't know.  As opposed to pouring plutonium into that microphone.  I think it's obvious we've got to take a break. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  But when it's dirty, do you spank?  Or do you like to be spanked?  No, no, no.  I definitely don't like it.  Spanking is a very singular thing.  Like, if you're dirty and you don't spank, it doesn't necessarily mean you're not dirty.  Oh, no, no.  You're right.  Like, I don't like spanking.  I think spanking comes off as silly when you're in bed doing it.  Like, I'll do it as a joke.  Sometimes a girl's getting up to go to the bathroom or something like that, and she's kneeling up in bed, crawling over.  So I will just whack her ass, and we'll just start laughing. 
[01:52:30]  Spanking, I'm using that as an example.  I like to do it just as a thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, bent over the bed.  No, on her stomach on my bed.  Really?  Rub the cheeks.  Yeah, and then you just tell her, whatever it is.  See, that's an odd thing.  That's too ritualistic for me.  But it's sexy.  They like it.  It feels good.  Yeah, but I'm thinking of doing, I like doing things during sex that you could do, like, during, like, if she's bent over the bed, and you're just railing her from behind.  Then a little smack, or a real tight fucking grip on her hip, and shit, and a fucking gun to the back of the head. 
[01:53:00]  Like Janice on the Supremes.  Yeah, you know.  Kenny.  My wife is anal retentive.  She won't let me fuck her in the ass.  Oof.  You knew exactly where it was going.  Of course, of course you knew.  Maybe it's the fact that you deliver it, like the fucking operator message.  These jokes that you know fucking, you just know where they're going.  But, yeah, spanking can be nice, like, especially if you're, like, if you're, if she gets wet.  Like, this is what a girl, if you spank her, and then you tell her, don't get wet. 
[01:53:30]  And if she gets wet while you're spanking her, you just brush the lips, and then you squeeze the pussy, or you slap her pussy a little bit.  Oh, yeah, okay.  You like that.  Yeah, that's good.  Pull her hair.  I like a lot of stupid foreplay at the beginning to the point where it's just like, wow, that's goopy.  Oh, that's goopy.  Can't even hold it in.  It's all over the sides like a fucking sprinkler hose exploded.  Goopy?  Do you call her pussy goopy?  It's goopy.  Like, ew, it's all goopy.  I say it looks like a taffy melted in your cunt or something. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, yeah, you can call it that.  So, wait, Sam, before we go over, I have to know.  What is your idea of being dirty?  Not even with Jess.  Say your past girlfriends.  It's just in general for you.  Well, no spanking, but maybe light hair pulling, grabbing, more grabbing.  But she has dark hair.  You know what I mean.  You know what I mean.  Grabbing, so you like grab her arm roughly while you're having sex and give her a little shake.  Like a kid with balloons.  Hey, you.  No, like grabbing. 
[01:54:30]  Like grab a butt cheek, grab a thigh, grab a whatever.  Take your damn hands off her.  No?  No.  Not grab her like that.  Those are awful grabs, by the way.  Yeah.  They're awful.  Well, I'm sorry.  Luckily, I won't be having sex with you.  Do you pin her shoulders down with your knees and spit in her face?  And then suck the spit up at the last minute?  That's always fun to do.  I've been with those.  The ones I want to spit in the face, that's hot.  Make sure your breath is always fresh.  But you hold that fucking mouth open, drift spit into it.  Wow.  Like a dog with rabies.  Fucking hot, man. 
[01:55:00]  Any girl, I want you to spit in her mouth, that's a good girl.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Not if my food pocket is.  Oh, God damn.  Yeah, make sure the food pocket is not acting up.  I had shrimp last night.  It's acting up a little bit right now.  Jesus.  I'm not going to be spitting in Eggman's face.  Are you at a point, like, I've had a couple of times, my girlfriend almost never had bad breath.  She really just didn't.  But if she had it, I would tell her, because it was so rare.  Like, she had great breath.  But I'd go, like, oh yeah, breath stinks.  Like, would your wife tell you, like, how your breath stinks if it does?  Or are you too embarrassed by that? 
[01:55:30]  No, I mean, for the radio show, I'd joke.  I don't have bad breath.  But if you ever had it.  Like, I'm sure at a time, we all have it.  She's never told me, so.  Okay.  I guess I'm doing her right now.  Yeah.  I would always.  If someone always has it, you can't tell them because it's, like, fucking.  No, I got, honestly, I got a food pocket.  It's a pain in the ass to keep it clean.  Can't you ever, like.  Food pocket.  They fucking closed the gap.  They did all sorts of shit.  It's a problem.  Put your cork in there.  Put your change in there or something.  Yeah.  Food pockets.  Purse.  Purse.  We got a break because we got.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes. 
[01:56:00]  We got live reads and we got the Mission Impossible people coming in today.  All right.  Not Tom Cruise and not the guy from.  Jeremy Renner, yeah.  No.  But we do have Simon Pegg who was really good in the movie.  Simon Peff.  And we got.  You did it wrong.  Paula Patton.  She's really good to look at in this movie.  And she was very good in the movie.  And then the dude that was in Slumdog Million.  Yeah.  Great.  He was in the movie for about 10 minutes, man.  Oh, shit.  He was good, though.  He was in it.  And we're bringing in the Burj Khalif Tower.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Say how tall are you and it will just tell us. 
[01:56:30]  Piece by piece.  Give me my read.  You got it.  Sirius XM.  Hey, this is Nick Swartzen.  Hey, this is Dimitri Martin.  Hello.  It's Ricky Gervais, man.  Yes, hello.  This is not Kevin Pollack.  Hi.  This is Stephen Merchant.  Thank you for listening to the Anthony OP.  Who is it?  OP and Anthony.  Is there a discussion on who goes first?  Is it always OP?  Anyway, OP and Anthony, you know him by now.  If you're a fan, that's why you're listening.  Steven Merchant coming in in about an hour. 
[01:57:00]  Maybe less, actually.  And we got three guys from Mission Impossible coming in today.  Oh, two guys and a gal.  Yeah, two guys and a gal.  You're right.  Simon Pegg.  He's been on our show a couple times.  Yeah.  Really good in the movie, Simon Pegg.  Funny.  Simon's very good.  Mission Impossible made $13 million over the weekend, but it's only in IMAX theaters right  now.  Oh, I want to go see it there.  When does it open wide?  I would imagine this week. 
[01:57:30]  It'll be Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday.  Did you even know there was going to be a Sherlock Holmes movie?  Yeah, I've seen the trailer.  I didn't know.  It flew under the radar, kind of.  Did it?  It all of a sudden, out of nowhere, it was...  I didn't see commercials.  I thought it was for Blu-ray.  I didn't realize it was for a new movie.  No, I've been seeing the trailer for it all over the place.  You did?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ah.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the number one movie this weekend.  Oh.  That New Year's Eve movie's still hanging in there.  Is it?  Who cares about that? 
[01:58:00]  Well, it's up to only $24.8 million after two weeks.  Oh, see, that's not very good.  And then The Sitter, $4.4 million over the weekend, $17.7 total.  The Shitter?  That's not that good, is it?  No.  Is that the new, what's his name, movie?  That's Jonah Hill's movie.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Thank you.  Oh, well.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Yeah, well.  But you and your people know what you're doing, I guess.  Man, man.  Man, man, man, man.  I joined Instagram, by the way.  You did?  Is that what you take pictures of?  With everybody else.  I don't know.  I don't know why. 
[01:58:30]  Bobby Kelly's on it.  And he, you know, prints his, or he puts up his artistic photos.  And I'm just kind of like, and me and Sam were talking about it.  And Sam's like, you just take a picture and throw like these filters that they put on it.  And it's like, ooh, look, it's art.  And I started laughing.  I'm like, yeah, you're really not doing much.  No.  You just like, take a picture.  And then you throw these wacky vintage filters on it and a frame-like looking thing.  But they're cool.  Yeah.  How do I enjoy all queer?  They make boring fucking pictures look good.  Yeah.  I got three pictures up.  Oh. 
[01:59:00]  Can I get Instagram on my joy?  Because now it's another thing to just worry about followers with.  How do you do Instagram?  You got to download the app, the Instagram app, which I have there.  But wait, wait, wait.  Yeah?  What's the difference between that and Twitter?  Well, you're not really chatting on this.  You can put up a picture and then leave comments.  And you could, you know, filter your pictures and add little things to it.  Your Instagram can also post on Twitter for you.  Yes.  How about that?  Iraq, can I Instagram on my phone?  What do you have? 
[01:59:30]  Motorola.  I am A-Kumi.  A-T-N-T.  A-C-U-M-I-A.  A-C-U-M-I-A.  One word.  And that's me.  And I have three pictures up.  Congratulations.  Yeah.  I'm very excited.  Can I Instagram on my phone?  I don't know.  Check whatever that app store is.  You got an app for that?  I'm going in my market.  No, I know I can't Instagram.  Why shoot you?  Because I got this.  Gregorio.  I got this cool phone.  The cool phone, huh?  I love this phone.  It doesn't make phone calls well, but it does everything else terrifically. 
[02:00:00]  I took a picture of the face of one of the giant nutcrackers I have in the house.  Yeah, why do you have a giant nutcracker in your house?  It's giant.  It's like life size.  It says Instagram for Android, but I have AT&T, so some people say I don't have an Android  phone officially.  What?  Gregorio.  I'm very confused.  Sweetie.  Oh, it only gets two stars.  Why?  Oh, wait.  It's called Instaroid?  Instaroid?  Instead of Instagram?  Instaroid?  It's an uncomfortable seat.  Ha, ha, ha, Instaroid. 
[02:00:30]  It's an ass fucking...  Oh, boy.  Their version of Instagram is called Instaroid.  Does anyone know anything?  I don't.  Ah, whatever.  Never heard of it, sir.  Yeah, I like the Instagram pictures, though.  They're nice.  Yeah, Bob puts a lot on there.  Bob is a...  Bob's an addict.  Bob's an addict, yes.  Bob is an addict.  Bob's a bag of shit.  That says it all.  Oh, my God.  I got 121 followers already.  How'd that happen?  Give a fuck.  I know.  Troy's always doing nothing.  At this point, I really don't care.  I'm only following 13 people.  I have...  This is five stars. 
[02:01:00]  This is at Bourbon Incorporated, right?  Yeah, but you're...  You got an iPhone.  See?  His version probably...  I got...  Is it free?  What do you mean?  Yeah.  It's called Instaroid.  That's just like Instagram, isn't it?  No.  It's free.  Yeah.  Troy uses it all the time.  I know.  He takes photos of people passed out drunk or sleeping on the subway.  And then Instagrams them.  Yeah.  I am... 
[02:01:30]  Let's see.  I'm following Troy.  I'm following Troy Kwan.  What else am I following?  My pal Kelly writes, Instagram is not available for Droid yet, but will be out within the next  few months.  Oh, that's good.  So I'm good.  I'm good then.  You'll get it when everyone's done with it and moved on.  What goes...  Yeah, moved on to other shit.  What is going on with, like, companies that don't have shit you need?  What are you talking about?  Like that.  What?  Like, it should...  Instagram's been around for a while. 
[02:02:00]  You should be able to get it, no matter what fucking phone you have.  You should have a fucking...  I guess.  One of those razors.  Did the golf cart plowing into the coach and the reporters at Cowboy Stadium, that was this  weekend?  I think so.  I didn't even know what happened.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  Someone just sent it.  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  And also, someone sent me a fucking video of a seven-foot eighth grader that knows how  to play basketball.  I play your basketball just like a normal kid. 
[02:02:30]  Does he have that voice?  If I had a seven-foot black son that played basketball, I would never let him leave the  house until he signs the big contract.  Yeah.  Why would you let him do anything?  Don't do anything.  You're going to fuck yourself up.  I would find some kind of distant relative and just say, just fucking raise my kid until  he signs that contract.  Yeah.  Right?  Exactly.  He's a seven-foot eighth grader.  He's going to fall down and hurt himself.  Seven feet.  I wouldn't allow him to do nothing. 
[02:03:00]  Except just practice.  I'd probably go with the weather like up there.  That's a...  That's a...  But that's a lottery...  That's a winning lottery ticket.  It is.  Why would you mess with that shit?  Because he might not be like...  Like, he might not be a good scorer.  He's great.  Go to...  Oh, is he?  Who fucking helped me out today?  Stall seat.  Go to stall seat.  You got to see this.  Yeah.  Or the stall seat.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  How the fuck they do it.  Oh, no.  Try the stall seat.  It's going to be okay.  Now it's just... 
[02:03:30]  I always get so perturbed.  Oh, that's nice.  Look at that.  Didn't take care of us today.  A must-buy.  The Opie and Anthony tribute to Patrice O'Neill.  Who is, bro?  The stall seat.  Put it on their website.  I hope all the websites did.  All right.  Here it is.  Oh, my God.  Seven-foot eighth grader.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  He's 14 years old.  He is...  He looks like one of those aliens that came out of the ship in Close Encounters at the end.  Sure.  And he is like charcoal black.  Yeah.  He's African, right? 
[02:04:00]  Or is he African or Nigerian?  I think he's Polish.  What?  No, he's not Polish.  Polish people don't have that.  They have blonde hair and a different heritage.  Well, Chip.  He looks like one of the guys who would help my mother fix the floor.  What?  Oh, no.  What city is he in?  Holy fuck.  Don't let this kid leave the house.  He's your meal ticket.  Let's see him play.  He can play.  Watch this.  All right.  I know it's radio.  Let's play those eight.  Oh.  Oh.  That's frightening me. 
[02:04:30]  The city leg hoops.  Oh.  Jesus.  His legs are fucking like toothpicks.  But he can fucking play, man.  He doesn't look that much bigger than the kids.  Well, they make them big these days.  Or he might be playing with older kids.  Maybe he's got on lift.  Oh, maybe he's not.  Maybe he's playing with a.  He's probably playing with a high school.  Oh, those are not eighth graders.  No, there's no way they're. 
[02:05:00]  I guarantee he's not playing with other eighth graders.  Can you move out that next time?  Let me see how old he's.  They're in their thirties.  But then again, they could be eighth graders.  He can fucking play, man.  He's 14 years old.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  He'll get a scholarship on this.  Huh?  He'll get a scholarship.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, man.  Go for him.  That's crazy, though.  He doesn't.  He looks weird, though.  Looks like.  Yeah, like one of those Nigerian runners. 
[02:05:30]  But he doesn't look that much bigger.  No.  He's got athletic ability, though, because a lot of kids that grow too fast, they can't move like that.  Right.  No, they get brittle bones.  Their bones get brittle.  They can't move like that.  And they're a little hunchbacky.  Hunchbacky.  Somebody else was saying something just when I was saying that.  What was the other thing we were going to look up?  Somebody said something about the thing.  Golf cart.  Oh, yeah, the golf cart.  Oh, the golf cart.  Jesus.  It's so loud.  Disturbance down on the field where during the celebration, apparently one of the carts on the field apparently got loose. 
[02:06:00]  And there have been some folks, I think, injured in this.  And you'll see.  Oh, wow.  That's like a bowling.  What the fuck?  How embarrassing.  What if that guy has got to bail out of the.  Just stop it.  Someone to stop it.  What the fuck?  Why did that one guy bail out of it? 
[02:06:30]  Because he couldn't stop it.  He kept.  Folks, I think, injured in this.  A runaway golf cart just plows over about four or five guys.  Just knocked him onto the thing.  His feet aren't, he can't get his feet on the brake pedal because they were over the front.  That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.  We're just a semi.  That's fucked up.  Everyone's all right?  That's hilarious.  Wow, they all have ass over tea kettle.  They're going to have some sore calves, but they'll be all right.  Hey, we were talking about houses earlier.  Just a quick thing.  Were you watching, I think, it might have been 60 minutes after football? 
[02:07:00]  No.  I didn't watch that.  What's going on in Cleveland?  No, what's going on over there?  We all know the housing market's in the shits and a lot of foreclosures is happening.  Yeah.  And it's so bad up in the Cleveland area, they've decided to knock down the houses to save neighborhoods.  Oh, really?  To save the neighborhoods.  So they're not crack houses or fire hazards?  Because there's so many houses that are foreclosed and abandoned that they have now decided to just fucking knock them down and turn them into lawns. 
[02:07:30]  Could you get a good house in Cleveland?  Oh, fuck yeah.  And what they're saying is, you know, as soon as these houses go into foreclosure, you know, the criminals are going around.  Yeah.  Or the opportunists.  And they're taking everything, obviously, the pipes and all the copper and all that.  Yeah, yeah, they got these houses.  So they're showing these houses where the whole first floor is completely destroyed because they're taking the siding and whatever they can.  Copper.  But they can't, then they're not doing it on the second level because they got to work fast. 
[02:08:00]  So you got these houses that look so shitty, you know, on the first level, but, you know, look like.  The second floor is still pretty much fine.  It's like ravaged by bugs.  But they're going around basically with the sheriffs and all, and, you know, they're kind of a little behind them and they're finding out which houses are foreclosing and they move in immediately and take everything.  Was this the story?  It was 60 minutes, right?  Yep.  But, I mean, the logic that they decided, look, let's just knock these down so we can save the value of the other homes in the neighborhoods because there's just too many that are abandoned at this point. 
[02:08:30]  More of the same, a spiral that, I don't know where the bottom is.  That's the problem here.  We don't know where the bottom is.  You haven't found the bottom.  Yes.  You have not found the bottom.  You'll find people left here who are doing the right thing, courageous, paying off their mortgage obligations.  But how long?  You know, I wonder, as you go through these neighborhoods, do you ever find people who have been living in their house for 30, 40, 50 years and have decided that no matter what happens around them, they're going to stay? 
[02:09:00]  We have found those people.  Yeah, assholes.  And, sadly enough, I'm not sure if they're telling you that because they really want to stay or because they have no exits.  Oh, they have no choice.  And that's the other sad reality.  Good folks here who pay their mortgage on time, paid the mortgage off, didn't take an equity line, pay their taxes on time, they're trapped.  Yeah, this is, uh, it's lawful.  Damn, that place is, uh, fucked, huh?  I wanted to show you the clip where they're just, where they show you the empty lots that are now just a nice green lawn.  He's standing in front of the house, though.  You can see it's been picked apart. 
[02:09:30]  Completely picked on the first level only, though.  Yeah.  Like a carcass that's got the meat rips off of it.  I used to do that on job sites.  I was doing an estate, this renovation of an estate, and they sent us in first to remove all the shit.  And, oh, boy, did we ever.  Really?  Just saws all and just copper lines.  Just fucking.  Did he make some money out of it?  Oh, yeah.  You did?  And then you just take it down to the scrap dealer.  Yep.  I've done that.  Big copper pipes.  You've done it?  No, I just, there's nothing worse than a guy that jumps in and adds nothing to a story.  I did it.  But just says he did it.  I did that. 
[02:10:00]  Nothing worse than somebody that does that.  It's going through, giving all the details, and shithead just jumps in.  I mean, I did the same thing.  I did it.  I think they wanted us to keep it for the construction company, too.  Sure.  How much did you get for copper?  It all depends on what the price is.  I don't even remember what it was then, but you'd get a couple of hundred bucks, something  like that, enough for beer money, pretty much, strip club.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  We've heard this.  And in Cleveland, they get to the point where idiots fuck with gas pipes for the metal, 
[02:10:30]  and it causes massive explosions.  That is good.  A lot of those massive explosions you see on the news, that's why.  They're ripping out the wrong pipes.  And guys getting electrocuted, because they're trying to get electrical lines, and shit like  that.  That is true.  We've heard that.  Some guy just got electrocuted and stealing from a school.  Yeah, stealing from a school.  And then they go for the guardrails.  They've been trying to steal guardrails and shit.  What?  Really?  Yeah.  Just any kind of metal they could take down to the scrapyard.  Wow.  Sure.  We had a horrific fucking story here in New York.  Oh, man. 
[02:11:00]  Another bad elevator story.  Yeah.  Wow.  We've been avoiding this one, but this is fucking horrific.  I'll be honest with you.  I didn't read the details of the story.  I didn't want to know.  So who's got it?  I got it.  It's pretty crazy.  Basically, you got a lady that was burned alive in an elevator because this guy was pissed  off at her.  I know that much.  Some old bag.  She had hired this guy.  Nice old lady, I think.  Yeah.  She had hired this guy to do some work.  New York City, by the way, Ed, you know?  Brooklyn.  Was it Brooklyn?  Brooklyn, man?  What?  She hired him to do some work around her place. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  She found out he was stealing and fired him.  And he fired her.  Ha ha.  And refused to pay.  Yeah.  I think he put an invoice on her door and said she owed like $300, but he was obviously  crazy.  This was over $300?  I've heard $2,100, too.  One paper quoted that.  He's crazy.  He was a psychopath.  And what do you think, man?  She didn't, they should have paid this guy, even if he had stolen and gotten rid of him  that way, because the danger he was posing to them.  Oh, yeah.  He was just a nut.  He was a nut. 
[02:12:00]  Look at him.  So she gets home with some groceries.  She goes in the elevator.  This guy's watching.  He presses a button on her floor, waiting for the elevator to stop.  He already had sprayed the front of the elevator door with gasoline and shit.  And then he was just waiting there.  With some kind of, you know, you know, those exterminator pump canisters that look like  fire extinguishers.  What was it called?  Accelerant?  Some kind of accelerant.  Well, he had that in there.  Yeah.  Gasoline in there.  Yeah.  The pump thing, though.  He was just pumping gasoline with that.  And then when the door opened, he pumped that shit all into her face and all over her 
[02:12:30]  body.  And then he had a Molotov cocktail.  So he lit the top of that and then just threw it into the fucking elevator.  And squirted more stuff on her.  And then, yeah, as she's on the floor burning, he just kept spraying her with the gas.  Fuck.  Yeah, just brutal.  And then the neighbors said they heard this horrid, very high, high-pitched screaming.  And popping.  Popping noises.  Yeah, because that was her fat melting.  And her son is still alive. 
[02:13:00]  They said this guy they knew was a problem.  He was kind of like standing outside the building.  They handled it wrong.  It's like, not blame me.  I'm not saying she deserved it.  This guy should be shot in the temple.  But he's a psychopath.  And there's a way to handle this guy.  He looks like he took a bit of a burn on the side of his face there.  They should literally just crush his head under a truck tire.  Yeah.  They should put his head under a tire and crush it.  Just pop it.  Or handcuff him and give the son a crowbar. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Make him scream.  Bah!  Wow.  And they got pictures of.  They got surveillance video inside the elevator.  So I wonder if that's going to leak out sometime.  They have the whole thing on video of her getting fucking burnt, screaming.  I'm sure it'll be out there.  It's probably no sound.  All crispy.  I don't need sound.  I don't need video.  I just wouldn't check that out.  Burn videos are the worst.  People on fire a little bit tend to run around a lot.  But people on a fire a lot just tend to stand there. 
[02:14:00]  They collapse.  And they just fall down in a lump.  A little bubbly lump.  I've seen a bunch of burn videos.  Yeah, I've seen those.  People setting themselves on fire.  Crazy people.  We're being set on the fire by a...  I told you the worst one I saw was a crowd.  Oh, the crowd.  Yeah.  I saw that one.  In Venice.  Did you?  Yep.  I saw those.  The guy was on the fence.  And he's going...  He's doing a Chewbacca impression.  It was a weird, guttural animal sound.  And he's trying to step on the match. 
[02:14:30]  Boy, that ain't working.  As they throw it at him.  Yeah.  It's fucking horrendous.  And I felt so bad for him.  But I'm like, what did he do?  If it's thievery or something, that's terrible.  But some of these guys are rapists.  Yeah.  And for everything we say, like, boy, I'd like to fucking take him and do this to him and stuff.  That's what they do there.  They really do it.  So, Sam, someone's going to sit where you are.  Can we turn their TVs off?  Yeah.  And make love?  Oh, boy.  No.  Oh, wow. 
[02:15:00]  Cool.  What have we got here?  What have we got here?  Wow.  How professional.  They're right on time.  These guys are coming up.  So, why don't we...  Yeah.  If they're on their way up, we'll take a break.  Yeah.  We're late with reads and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  When we get back, we got a lot of people from Mission Impossible coming in.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  Are the Mission Impossible guys here? 
[02:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let's get them in here.  Ah!  You get your Christmas shopping done, Ant.  I'm an online guy.  Yeah.  So, I order shit online, and then it shows up at the house, and then I wrap it up, and  then I'm done.  That's good.  That is really good.  I don't like the mall.  I don't like shopping.  I don't like going out in huge, crowded malls.  I went out last night to...  You don't like going to the mall? 
[02:16:00]  I kind of like it, man.  Fuck no.  I don't like driving in and out of the fucking places.  No.  You know what?  You got to go off hours a little bit.  I kind of like the festiveness.  I don't like the crowd, and I don't like how slow it is to check out, to get like...  You get your shit.  I want to get the fuck out of there.  True.  That's how online is for me.  It's like, order.  Yep.  Send.  He has a credit card.  Gone.  Done.  Send me.  Ship.  I don't like standing there on a line, and there's always fucking some problems with  people in front of you. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  And it takes the Christmas spirit away from me.  I'd rather not deal with people.  That's my Christmas spirit.  Online shopping is the way to go.  It certainly is.  Holy fuck.  Simon Pegg.  God damn it.  Simon Pegg coming into the studio.  Simon's back.  And also the beautiful Paula Patton.  Yes.  Looking good.  Yes, indeed.  Wait, who's that guy?  Hey.  Simon Pegg.  Simon Pegg.  What's up, brother?  Good to see you again.  Back again.  I like that.  I'm very excited you're here. 
[02:17:00]  I saw the fucking movie, and you were great.  Just hit movie after hit movie.  You saw my fucking movie?  Yeah.  I'm calling it your fucking movie.  It's special.  I know.  A little movie called Mission Impossible.  Ghost Protocol.  It was great, man.  Did you see IMAX?  Oh, yeah.  The only way to see it.  It's quite...  Obviously, the sequence everyone's talking about with the Burj Khalifa.  Yeah.  Every time I've watched it, the audience go...  Yeah, they get like...  You see that shot.  Everyone gets vertigo.  Yeah, you have to feel it.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, speaking of the tower there, pictures came out of Tom Cruise on the top of the whole 
[02:17:30]  thing.  Yeah.  And I was expecting to see it in the movie.  It's not in the movie.  No, that was just a kind of like little kind of promo thing he did.  Yeah.  Hey, look at what Tom's doing.  He's just sitting up on the fucking building.  I was thinking if he's going to sit on the top and you got the cameras, you might as  well try to figure out how to get it in the movie.  It was hard to contrive him sitting on the top.  I know, I know.  We've got like 23 minutes to save the world and he's going to sit and go, hey.  Just sit on the top.  Hey, look at me.  I need a break.  I know.  Yeah.  I'm not bitching because the scene they used was just horrifying. 
[02:18:00]  I think the thing was they wanted to make sure people knew.  It's really important to Tom that people know that it's him because it just makes it  a little bit more scary.  Yeah.  Come on, man.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Yeah.  So, you know, I think getting those shots was a good way of saying he did this.  Now, you're in the hotel room when he's out there doing all that, right?  Yeah.  But you had to look out.  Were you just freaked out?  Can I just tell you something that's going to spoil your life?  Great.  I wasn't really there.  Everything that took place in the hotel room was, it was too much of a health and safety 
[02:18:30]  issue to do it.  Holy shit.  You're so hot.  I'll just leave.  Shall I go?  Oh, my God.  She just ruined the Simon Peggy.  Simon's talking about the magic of filmmaking.  I'm used to this happening.  Holy crap.  He wasn't there.  Every red carpet around the world, I'll be chatting to some journalist and they're  going, what?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw Mission Impossible.  Paul Patton just arrived.  And you're hot in the movie, but oh, my God, in person, you're ridiculous. 
[02:19:00]  I'll talk very little bit.  That's a compliment.  I'm sorry.  Because they will.  I'm sorry.  I like that.  I like that.  Thank you.  Holy crap.  She just took my breath away.  And how do you say it?  Anil?  Anil Kapoor.  Kapoor.  And we know you from Slumdog Millionaire originally.  Most famous actor in all of India.  He is?  Yes, he is.  We had some amazing stats coming.  Can I break this?  Yeah, please.  Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol has done 119% better than any Hollywood movie ever in 
[02:19:30]  terms of his opening in India.  In India.  That's right.  India.  Thank you, Mr. Kapoor.  No, no.  Because he's the big star.  He's the biggest star.  But what is the American equivalent?  I want to understand how big you are in India.  Are you George Clooney in India?  He's Tom Cruise big.  Tom Cruise?  Tom Cruise big.  At the moment, I'm Simon Pegg of India.  That's good, Simon.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  Are you guys dating?  Simon's a juggernaut right these days.  I didn't think they were dating.  I thought I was the Simon Pegg of India. 
[02:20:00]  I saw the movie and it was great.  You guys were all great in the movie.  And we were discussing the tower.  And he's telling me that you guys weren't actually in the hotel room for the big scene.  Well, you guys had a scene.  You were.  Yeah.  The scene when Tom's hanging out, Paula and Jeremy were.  I never had to go.  Actually, when the window was open, I was somewhere in Dubai shopping.  He was skiing indoors somewhere.  You didn't want to just check it out?  No.  No. 
[02:20:30]  I did go up.  I went up and thought, okay.  Good.  Bye.  Bye, guys.  See ya.  I'm good.  Did you take a look when the window was open?  I was there when the window was open.  She had no heartache.  I have a healthy fear of heights, you know, that just like, not a vertigo, but my toes  start to tingle.  Right.  And all the boys had on harnesses, but because my dress was so tight, I couldn't.  All I had was a stuntman, I hear that, holding onto my ankle.  I bet.  And as we began the scene, you know, Jeremy's out the window, but I'm far into the room.  And then Jeremy catches Tom's legs, then I catch Jeremy's legs. 
[02:21:00]  And by take six, I was so far out the window that I could see Tom.  And Tom was like, hey, Paul, how you doing?  And I'm like, hi.  And you didn't have a harness on?  No harness.  I was like, don't get sweaty palms right now, okay, buddy?  That's crazy.  How high up was that?  124th floor of the tallest building in the world.  Yeah, it's got to be 20, 30 feet.  How's higher than that?  It's like 1,200.  I don't know.  How high is the Empire State Building?  So we know.  That was about...  Oh, that thing?  The Twin Towers are 110 stories. 
[02:21:30]  So this is...  Burj Khalifa is three times the height of the Empire State.  There it is.  That's crazy.  That's your reference point.  That's crazy.  And so Paula and Jeremy and Tom were probably about two and a little bit times as high as  the Empire State Building.  You were hanging out the window without...  Like just my head, but yes.  How does insurance allow that?  You know what?  Insurance finds out afterwards.  It's one of those things.  You know, it's like now they're like, oh, my God.  We understand that.  Wow, man.  You got to, you know.  Yeah.  It's like, wow, they did a great job of taking that harness out so quickly in the shot. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, no, she wasn't wearing one.  Damn it.  She smells good, too.  He still got some of that.  That's me, buddy.  That's me.  That's me.  That's me.  That's me.  That's me, man.  Amazing.  These English guys, these English chaps all smell good.  I brush up good.  I don't know what I missed because this is the first Mission Impossible movie I've seen.  And that's insane.  Are you serious?  Which helped sell the movie because I didn't feel like I needed to know anything.  Well, did you just go to see it because we were coming today?  Or did you see it because you wanted to?  Free tickets.  Tell the truth. 
[02:22:30]  I guess technically, yeah, but also because of the tower and stuff, it really got people  interested in this movie.  Did you like it?  I loved it.  I really did.  Go back and see the first three now because they're all very different.  You'll have more fun.  Yeah, they're all really different.  And again, I've got to ask you because last time you were in here, we talked about Star  Trek and that whole franchise and then you just being thrown into it and you were happy  like a little kid in there.  Now being part of the Mission Impossible franchise, boy, they are really kind of going for Simon  Pegg here.  Well, I did the third one. 
[02:23:00]  I did a very small part in the third one and that's really how I got to know JJ and why  I got Star Trek.  So coming back to this one, I felt like as the old hand, you know, it was cool.  It was like me and Tom were like, okay, guys, this is the deal.  Mission Impossible.  But yeah, it's fun.  That's because Simon's got great karma.  He's one of the sweetest men and he's so funny.  Like no other mission.  Simon, you're great in this movie.  You laugh out loud.  He's phenomenal.  This is Paula Patton speaking.  None of the guys.  That's good.  And she doesn't like funny guys.  I do like funny men.  He's funny and well hung, I hear. 
[02:23:30]  So that's good.  Oh, yeah.  Keep talking.  I endorse it.  That's a fully 100% endorsement.  You know, very charismatic and charming.  Jimmy wants to know if you're packing up.  How do you get that rumor?  I was trying to start that rumor about myself for a long time.  You get one of the most gorgeous actresses in Hollywood to say it live on the radio.  That's what you do.  Now you're talking.  Simon is fucking on a whole other level now.  So did you get more work in America after Slumdog?  Because that was so great and you were so great in it.  Thank you so much.  Yes, I did 24, the show. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, yeah?  And that was one of the best experiences of my life.  I just loved doing it.  And that's what I did.  I was here in L.A. for a year for that.  Yeah.  Because I heard in India that they want to see you doing more American stuff and they wanted  to see bigger parts and more stuff.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Hopefully.  I think after Mission Impossible and 24 and Slumdog.  And you sing too, right?  I sing, but I play back.  I do, I do.  But in India, we don't really sing, actually.  The actors don't sing.  They have other singers singing for us.  Oh, okay.  And we just lip sync.  The big Bollywood dance numbers and stuff? 
[02:24:30]  A lot of lip syncing.  Is that a quality in Indian films?  Because I love that at the end of that Slumdog.  Isn't it so great?  They're all dancing together.  The people that hated each other.  And they're all having fun.  And you leave the theater.  They're like, oh, okay.  Now I'm not bummed out.  This really made me feel good when they were all happy in the train station.  I'm like, fuck, this is the problem.  You know what?  Colors coming at you on the screen.  It's fantastic.  We liked it because there was one movie.  Imagine every movie ended up like that.  That is true.  I bet you he's sick of it.  I think if they danced at the end of The Godfather, that wouldn't have worked. 
[02:25:00]  That would be amazing.  Luca Brasi doing the joke.  Yeah, that would be great.  The end of Jaws, you know, Dreyfus, and they're paddling back and the shark pops up.  Yeah, they all do a little number together with colorful clothing on.  That's kind of like the end of Return of the Jedi, to be fair.  I mean, all those little Ewoks dancing.  Yeah, there's a little Ewok dance scene.  These two are great in the movie.  Their main scene is together there.  Neil's trying to, you know, there's a whole seducing thing going on between these two. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh, you haven't seen it yet, have you?  No, I'm going to go and it opens up wide.  Very sexy and naughty, yes.  It gets naughty.  I know, I like the why.  I love that scene.  I think that scene's very cool, though, with these guys.  Because, like, Paula's character's, like, she's an agent.  You know, she's not immediately a temptress.  So she finds that even though she's clearly got the ability, it's not so easy for her to just click into being the kind of, you know, sexy, sort of seductress.  And so it's a brilliant scene because she's sort of, she's trying to play this part and, you know, trying to fool a Neil. 
[02:26:00]  And then Neil's kind of going with it.  And then she keeps being tough with him and he kind of likes it.  It's just, it's one of my favorites.  I love it.  I like it.  And there's some cleavage.  Oh, yes, honey.  Some nice cleavage.  Wait a minute, that's the picture they put on the poster.  Those are my weapons of mass destruction.  Mass direction.  There is a lovely picture in the New York paper today, by the way.  Have you seen it?  Show us.  The fire cleavage.  Oh, God.  I heard about it. 
[02:26:30]  Is it the Daily News or is it the post?  Oh, it's the bikini shot.  Yes.  Really?  There's a bikini picture of you today.  It must be the post.  What are you going to hear now is paper.  I'm going to dive in there.  Do you even know this?  Oh, that's pretty nice, right?  It is pretty much.  You wear it well.  It looks like a scandal picture, like I've had sex with a senator or something.  I don't know what happened.  Wow.  If I haven't.  That's the one you texted me.  Shut up, Simon.  We're both married.  Quit. 
[02:27:00]  That's one page in.  I'm in trouble.  I'm kidding.  They wanted to put that on the cover.  You know they did.  It's one page in.  One page in.  Ah, we've got to get the horrible burn story in first.  That bikini shot is way more important than the guy that burned the lady alive.  Yes, please.  That's how good your body is.  That would have sold more papers than the front page.  Of course it would have.  Oh, God.  Of course.  If I had a girlfriend and you liked me, I would cheat with you in front of her.  She couldn't even get mad at me.  I'd be like, come on.  And she'd be like, yeah, fair enough.  I'm sure that fantasy is coming true. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, I know.  That's just speculating.  Were any of you guys a fan or at least watch the original show, Mission Impossible?  I remember it from Peter Graves.  Yeah, and Leonard Nimoy, of course.  Yeah, Leonard Nimoy was in some of that.  And then, oh, God, Martin Lando.  Martin Lando, yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  And the black guy.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice of them to put him in.  Yes.  Very, very generous.  I always like that show because no matter how technical they were trying to be, all  they did was usually turn the audio down on a drill. 
[02:28:00]  It's like, why isn't that drill making any noise?  And all you hear is like, that's an IMF fucking drill right there.  In those days, a quiet drill was an amazing thing.  That was an amazing thing that they would never have.  And the masks, which you still use in the movies.  Oh, yeah.  But it looks so much better now.  Peter Graves would be standing there and it's some other guy.  It's not Peter Graves.  His big, big nose.  And it's the other actor.  Yeah.  And then he's like talking, going, oh, yeah, well.  And he does this.  And then for a second, you see like this bad Planet of the Apes almost looking mask.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He pulls it off. 
[02:28:30]  But it was cool.  You know, you bought it at the time.  And the thing I love about this movie and the others as well is that they totally go  with that.  It's not like they kind of pretend that it was a bit cheesy.  It's a bit 60s.  No, we completely embrace it.  They go with the mask.  The gadgetry is fantastic in the Mission Impossible movies.  Yeah.  Although in this film, it kind of all goes wrong.  That's kind of a sweet thing about this film is that they're working with a load of stuff,  which is a bit like shoddy, knockoff kind of gadgets.  They bought it from some Russian arms contractor and it all kind of breaks.  Well, since the whole organization's kind of, you know.  There's no backup.  No text support.  Yeah, no backup. 
[02:29:00]  No text support.  That's exactly it.  You can't just bring the guy back at the office.  Listen, I'm having a problem with my sticking gloves.  You don't get that.  How long were you guys in Dubai for?  I actually want to go there.  A month.  A month, yeah.  It's a crazy place.  I heard it's expensive, though.  Well, it's very from New York.  Yeah, it is.  It is, it is.  It is, right?  We had per diems.  It was fine.  But if you're from New York, like, expensive is pretty relative.  Like, New York, things are expensive, but it's home, so we're used to it.  It's true.  You guys would be like, it's a little bit more expensive, but not a lot.  If you're from Kansas, there's a problem.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Yes, absolutely.  It's all like, you know, it's all malls filled with the highest, you know.  Is it very, does it have a westernized feel to it?  Absolutely.  Yes, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't feel like it.  The thing about it, though, is that you can go to the desert and have these incredible just landscapes and camels that are running free, and then you're in the city, and then you have those architectural wonders, like the Burj Khalifa.  That is amazing.  It's a place where, if you can dream it, they will build it.  Yeah.  That's what's kind of amazing about it.  Didn't they build it?  The cleanest built, like, bathrooms in the mall, like, was the mall not magnificent? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, it's like Vegas, but with less, uh...  Titties.  Yes.  Say titties again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they're there, but they're just underground.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you guys stay in the Burj?  Did you stay in the Burj Khalifa?  We went in there.  Sadly, no.  We didn't.  We stayed in a neighborhood.  All the hotels are pretty large, but we didn't.  It's an Armani hotel in the Burj Khalifa, and the rooms, I mean, it's a stunning place.  I'm obsessed with that building, because I'm so afraid of heights, so I want to go. 
[02:30:30]  You should go.  But you know what?  You get a kind of weird...  You're all in airplanes, right?  And, like, are you...  Yeah, I mean, I...  Well, that's what it feels like.  When you're up that high, it's almost...  Isn't that odd?  You look out a window and almost feel like you're, oh, this is like when I'm...  You see helicopters flying underneath you.  Lower than you are.  That's unbelievable.  Just sitting there.  Imagine cutting out that window.  Yes.  That's when you get...  That's when the breeze comes in.  Yeah, that is the crazy part.  It's like...  It's amazing.  The funny thing is, Tom, when he got his harness on and he looked at it, and all the stuntmen  were just, like, pale.  They were more pale, yes. 
[02:31:00]  Was he not nervous?  Because he's nuts.  He does all his own stuff.  He just had a big shit, T.T. grin on his face the whole time.  He was like, let's do this.  Wow.  He loved it, right?  Yeah.  So much fun.  Jesus, that's...  Close your mind.  For us, it was like watching the film live.  Imagine that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't die.  Don't die.  Yeah, if the boss dies, we're out of a job.  I had nightmares.  I watched those clips on YouTube when they were doing it, and I'm so afraid of heights.  I would literally wake up and think of that view that they showed.  Oh, it's horrendous.  I see an IMAX.  You're going to have a problem with this movie, then. 
[02:31:30]  But he likes stuff like that.  When they erase all the lines and stuff.  Yeah, he does.  He has everything to live for, and he loves doing crazy.  He's like an alpha guy, man.  He's just kind of hanging on the side of the building in one of his gloves, like,  sort of hinted at, starts malfunctioning.  Now he's hanging on with, like, one hand on the side of the building in this movie.  It's horrifying.  I think that when you watch the film, if you know that it was actually Tom Cruise...  If it's a stuntman, you think, oh, well, it's a stuntman.  If it's CG, you think there's no danger.  But it's Tom F. fucking Cruise hanging off a building. 
[02:32:00]  Yep.  Oh, look who's here.  Stephen Merchant.  Stephen Merchant's here.  Well, we're kind of like all the book.  I apologize.  Did you go do stand-up in the UK?  We were speaking about that last time.  I never did, no.  You must do it.  He doesn't want to.  Yeah, I'm going to argue American.  Do a cultural exchange with Steve.  I love Stephen Merchant.  Thank you very much.  Am I on?  Yeah, you are.  Oh, we're all on all the time.  Stephen, no, it never ends.  You'll never not on.  You know it.  Do you guys know each other?  Here's Peggy.  Oh, you know it.  I know I'm from TV.  You know I'm from TV.  That's all.  You know me from TV?  This is Fallen Pound.  That's right. 
[02:32:30]  I love you.  Stephen Merchant.  Yeah.  That's something nice to hear from home.  All right.  Hello.  Here you go back.  I like the how do you do's.  Yes.  Weird old thing.  I feel like I need to be on.  We all live in a big comedy house together.  Should we move him to the table somehow?  If we can move Stephen up, I would love to.  Yeah, that's one of my favorite people alive.  Come on in.  Get him a chair.  Let's go.  Let me just start.  I hate to have a fear, master of the pan flute.  Can we bring a chair in for Stephen so he's not standing?  Simon, I follow you on Twitter, and you seem to travel a lot.  Is it a lot of business, or do you just go to some places for the hell of it? 
[02:33:00]  This tour for the Mission Impossible tour has been global.  Hey, I'm in Spain.  Hey, I'm in France.  Hey, I'm Germany.  Like in the same day.  Yeah, it's all the same day.  I'm like, what the hell is Simon?  He's just traveling.  He's like on the lam.  It's like Twitter is the home of the humble brag.  It's like saying, you're just saying, really, I'm going all over the world.  But hey, I'm now.  Home, another day in Berlin.  Oh, Berlin boring.  Yeah, because then I read the one that's like, oh, on my way to the Big Apple.  Hop across the pond. 
[02:33:30]  They're promoting this movie globally.  Not many movies do that right out of the box like this.  No, but it's very much a global film.  We've got people from all over the world.  Neil, Vladimir.  Yeah, we've got the biggest star in Russia, the biggest star in India.  We've got Michael Nyquist, of course, from Sweden, who was in the original.  The blonde Russian.  Lea Seydoux.  She's French, actually.  The French?  The fight they have.  Be careful now.  If you like a girl fight.  It's a great girl fight.  It's a great girl fight.  She's awesome, actually. 
[02:34:00]  She's gorgeous.  She is.  It even has the bit where the dress is slightly ripped during the fight.  It's classic.  You got to do that.  You got to do that.  And we have for the girl crush.  And the creator of arguably one of the greatest shows ever.  Ever.  Yes.  Thank you.  Oh, you were talking to me.  I thought you were talking to me.  My face wasn't quite as big as the office.  Of course, the English office.  We referenced that show all the fucking times.  It's just a work of art.  We told Ricky it is.  It's the greatest thing ever shot.  Ricky's the biggest ass on that show, and you cannot possibly... 
[02:34:30]  And in real life.  Just end in real life.  Yeah.  Explode anybody.  From his tweets, you kind of...  That character is by far one of the most uncomfortable people to watch on television.  The wanting and needy personality and thinking he's funny, but kind of really deep down knowing  you.  There must be a lot of people in this room like that.  Oh, yeah.  I know at least one of them.  Yes.  We're all insecure.  I think everybody in entertainment has a bit of insecurity. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, definitely.  Just because...  Just to be in entertainment, you kind of, hey, look at me.  Hey, did I do good?  Yeah.  Did I get your adulation?  On the radio, it's like, I think I'm fascinating for four hours every year.  Yeah, listen to me.  Yeah, with no planning.  I made such a great point.  Did I?  And then you just read, you suck.  Oh, yeah.  Apparently, I suck.  Yeah, I've done interviews where I thought we were hitting home runs, and I get a bunch  of Z's on my Twitter, and I'm like, fuck you guys.  Z's must be good, right?  It's just a waste of time. 
[02:35:30]  I think the brilliant thing about that character, though, is that despite all of that, you still  kind of love him.  You still want him to do well.  Yeah, that's so hard to do.  No, it's chemistry.  A character that could easily have fallen into that, oh, fuck him, good, I'm glad he's  failing or miserable, but you feel like, oh, no.  No matter how awful he gets, you just want him, come on, David, you can do it.  Don't do that, don't do that.  And that's why when he succeeds at the end, when he kind of gets a little moment.  Yeah.  You just, it's joyous.  It's absolutely joyous. 
[02:36:00]  It was, yeah, just the things that said the guy, when Tim comes in, he goes, Tim Canterbury,  Canterbury Tales.  Why say that?  That's something a guy says.  It's just awful.  I like when he calls out Finchie at the end, too, because that was just brewing the whole  show, where it's like, hey, Finchie, what?  And he's laughing at him, just no respect for the man, and he's just kissing his ass.  He was in the show in order to show that David Brent wasn't as bad.  You know, there's always someone worse.  Because there's someone worse.  There's someone worse.  But do I say Brent?  Oi, Brent. 
[02:36:30]  No one said Oi, Brent.  No one said Oi, Brent.  You live in the dream of a couple together English-isms.  But listen, thanks for talking about a show that's 10 years old.  Yes, 10 years old.  Well, we're going to segue into Extras, of course, which you were in, Laura.  Extras, of course.  You were brilliant.  That's nine years old.  You already talked about the 60s version of Mission Impossible.  Right.  Well, the guys from Mission Impossible only have three minutes, and we'll certainly do more  with Stephen Merchant as well.  Just want to make sure we get the word out.  I knew Merchant had monopolized the whole thing when he came in.  Sorry.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:37:00]  Simon, are you working on anything else in the interim?  I start Star Trek imminently.  Fuck, Gert, yeah.  I love Star Trek.  In January, we begin.  Yeah, any inkling of a story?  I should get to read it, like, in the next couple of days, so I'll come back and say  it live on air.  Just Twitter it.  Do you only appear in movies based on 60s TV?  Yeah.  That is my rule.  If it doesn't, I'm looking towards a remake of I Dream of Genie. 
[02:37:30]  Simon Pegg in I Dream of Genie.  Simon Pegg is Darren Stevens in Bewitched.  They did that already, didn't they?  Yeah, they did.  Damn you.  Who did it?  Will Ferrell.  Yeah, Will Ferrell did that one, yep.  Well, wow.  Mission Impossible.  Go see it.  Coming out when?  Friday wide?  Still in Wednesday?  Wednesday wide?  What the?  Yeah.  But go IMAX if you can.  Yeah, go IMAX now.  Absolutely go IMAX.  No, no 3D.  No, just big.  IMAX is better than 3D.  It's just giant.  Just giant.  Everything's just giant.  They have it in 3D too?  No.  No. 
[02:38:00]  That giant screen where it looks like you're going to fall out of buildings.  You don't need it in 3D though, it's fine.  I will, because I'm afraid of heights.  I really, that's, I made me want to see it long before the film was out.  Yeah, absolutely.  I just want to repeat what I said before.  Well, you did.  If it's uninteresting once, it's fascinating twice.  You barely talked to a nil too, man.  I know.  Biggest star in India.  And we are crazy.  Give it up no time.  And the world.  And the world.  And you were great.  You were so good in that too.  Just that, what a shithead to write that in the fog on the mirror.  And you're like, oh, he's helping him out.  And I'm like, I fucking got roped in.  I really thought you were trying to be helpful. 
[02:38:30]  Helpful.  That trick never works.  Were you surprised that did as well as it did, the Slumdog?  We all were surprised.  You were, right?  I think all of us connected with the film were surprised, absolutely.  But pleasantly surprised.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was just a chain of events that brought that film to the forefront.  What a brilliant way to tell a story.  I know you guys have to go.  But what a brilliant way to tell a story that was.  How he knew something.  It's good to explain also the movie from five years ago.  Have you done something from ten years ago we could discuss?  How long have you got?  Yeah.  Just half of it. 
[02:39:00]  Five years ago.  Shaun of the Dead.  Let me see.  That's the new motion picture.  That's only seven years ago.  We should be talking about that.  All right.  Well, good luck with Mission Impossible.  Absolutely.  I hope you need it.  Of course.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Good to see you.  Guys, great to have you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Anytime.  For Star Trek when you come back.  Absolutely.  You know I love to come in.  You want to do a quick break and we'll continue with Stephen Merchant?  Yeah, let's do that.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:39:30]  Yes.  All right.  Now the music's got to be played.  Yeah, now that we got those Mission Impossible people out of here.  Yes.  We could really have a good time now.  I was happy they were here, but I was really psyched you were coming.  Oh, you were losing your mind when he was walking down the hall.  Stephen Merchant.  You know, my wife wanted to come in today.  She rarely wants to come in, but she fucking loves you.  Yeah.  It'd be nice to see her again because I haven't seen her since.  Oh, my word.  Here we are.  Whoa.  Hang on a minute.  He's already started.  But she doesn't come in for nobody that she wanted to meet you. 
[02:40:00]  Thank you.  She's babysitting my kid right now.  Or our kid, I guess.  It's not called babysitting when she's the mother.  No, no.  It's babysitting.  There's times when you're a father or a mother, but there are times you're just babysitting  the kid.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  You're pretty much keeping it from dying.  Yes.  That's your whole job.  That's your job as a parent.  Yeah.  Why weren't you in, why were you in more in extras and not in the office?  Did you not want to be in the office?  No.  It was just that there was no obvious role for me in that show.  And I was just pleased that I was writing it and being involved with it at all. 
[02:40:30]  You know, it never occurred to me until much later.  Wait a minute.  Ricky was getting loads of free stuff for being on TV.  That could have been me.  That's why I put myself in extras.  I didn't want to miss a trick there.  But no, it was one of those things.  The weird thing is people always presume if you're involved with TV that you want to be on  TV and be a star and be the center of attention.  I was enjoying being a writer and, you know, a director and stuff.  And you're at Town Hall tomorrow and the next?  Right.  Two shows.  So much for behind the scenes.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, no, because I started stand-up years ago.  I did it. 
[02:41:00]  That was the first thing I ever did was stand-up.  Oh, good, good.  Right.  When I first left college.  And I went, you know, I did it for sort of five years to almost total indifference.  And since I've had a degree of celebrity, I've thought I'll cash in on that.  Yeah, you might as well.  You'll get people down there to see it.  Because they like your animated character.  Right, exactly.  Yeah, and I'm very, I'm quite animated on stage, which people are always impressed by.  I'm quite, when I can't get a laugh, I will just do a funny face, a funny dance.  So I have no shame.  I'm happy to do that.  So have you been going on and just working out material? 
[02:41:30]  Well, I just did a tour in the UK, which I've just finished.  And I did a little show last night here in New York.  But it's the first time I've ever performed in America.  So it's kind of weird to just, it's not just a question of changing pavement to sidewalk.  It feels like there's a whole other rhythm, maybe, that I've only got two nights to get into.  Do you feel it?  Do you feel like, you know, like you feel that the people are giving you back some goodness?  Yeah, I think the audience is great.  I just feel like I, I was just talking to Sam about this, because there's just a different rhythm that's not quite the same that I've sort of got to try and get used to really quickly. 
[02:42:00]  You should go work out somewhere tonight, or at least go to a set somewhere if you can.  Yeah, go get a few minutes in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I would.  That's why I've never gone over, because I'm like, yeah, I don't think they'd like me in Europe.  My cadence is different.  I think they'd love you.  No, no, no.  But he's right, what is it?  It's the pace.  It's a rhythm.  Something's different.  Something's different.  Yeah, I'm a little bit jumpy about that, actually.  And yeah, there are certain references I've changed.  I've got a joke which ends, in the UK, it ends with the C word.  Uh-huh.  And I've been talking a lot to people, because it's like, it seems it's a much stronger word here.  Not on this show. 
[02:42:30]  Exactly.  All jokes should begin with it.  Don't listen to them.  Do what you do.  Fuck them.  You gotta say cunt, you gotta say cunt.  Even though, but it does mean a lot more here.  But that whole Laurie thing, and Lou, you know, that doesn't work.  No, that doesn't make any sense.  It's a truck and a bathroom.  I understand, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks, because I've got a big routine about the lavatories at truck stops.  Which would have destroyed you, because that's a lot of Laurie and Lou and Lou and Lou.  Yeah, and the fag, fag thing is confusing.  Fag thing, that gets a lot of people.  Some of them love it. 
[02:43:00]  Some of them are very confused.  Exactly.  Well, you see a comic do ten minutes on that, and how the mix-ups can happen.  It's just...  Very integrity-driven.  Integrity-driven.  Ricky's doing stand-up.  Have you seen him do stand-up?  I've seen him do stand-up in the past.  I haven't seen his latest stuff that he's working on, but yeah, no, I always try and  go see the shows.  I don't think he comes to see my shows.  He tends to be asleep by, you know, nine.  Oh, really?  Really?  Yeah, he's an early...  Yeah, he likes to be in his pajamas by sort of six.  Wow.  And yeah, he doesn't go out much late at night, so... 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  He tweets a lot.  He does a lot of tweeting.  I don't look at tweeting a lot.  You're not a tweeting guy.  Well, I do it just for the tour I've been tweeting, but I find it too weird.  Which one are you, by the way?  Because people are trying to figure it out.  It is a odd thing.  Yeah, there's one, SM Hello Ladies.  That's you, okay.  That's the real thing.  There's a lot of...  There's imposters.  Do you have imposters?  Yeah.  This is a weird phenomenon, it seems.  It really is.  Yeah, yeah.  And when you're verified, you don't have to deal with that.  You're verified?  Yeah.  How did you get verified?  That's just what I do.  I can't.  But I can't be bothered to tweet, and I am me.  Like, the idea that there's someone else who's pretending to be me, doing more tweeting 
[02:44:00]  than I am.  They're often far more using than I ever was.  They have to live their life and your life.  But what mindset is that?  It's so bizarre to me.  It really is.  It's so strange.  You wake up and you think, I would love to pretend to be Steve Murchison.  There doesn't seem to be a reason.  Are they pretending to be you, or are they saying shitty things that you would never say?  No, not at all.  No, they're saying things like, just have dinner with Carl.  Just, like, kind of things that might happen.  What a lunatic.  It's so strange.  That's creepy.  Isn't that weird? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  People, like, I can see when they're attacking people, like, they'll have, like, what was,  there was some celebrity, though, like, not him, like, Gary Busey or something, whatever  they were saying.  That makes sense.  You see, yeah, if you want to badmouth someone.  But just to masquerade as them and imagine what they might write.  And then write something like this.  Right.  That's creepy.  Do you feel like the internet has, like, were we always this crazy as a civilization?  No.  And the internet has just revealed to us how crazy we all are?  I don't think so.  Or has it bred craziness?  I think it's bred craziness. 
[02:45:00]  It's opened it up.  It's like one of those, you know, you put your toe in the water.  Right.  And in time, your whole body will be in the water.  The, at the onset of this social networking, it was just a toe in the water.  You didn't feel like giving out that much.  It was an anonymous post on a website was fine.  Yeah.  Now it's like, hey, this is absolutely me.  Right.  You know it's me.  And I'm going to post pictures from my house and tell you what the argument I got in and  tell you what I ate.  Right.  Like, who, first of all, who really cares? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  And secondly, why do we feel so compelled to put our lives out there?  It's so strange.  Every minutia.  But not just in with that, like, was there as many pedophiles in the 50s as there are now?  Like, is it people just, like, going online thinking, well, I mean, I've heard a lot  about it.  I'll just, I'll see if it takes my fancy.  Again, you know, when you dip your toe in that water, it doesn't take long before you're  diving all the way in.  You know what it is?  We've always been this crazy.  We've always, look at, look at.  Do you think?  Yes.  I mean, they used to put people on their heads and open their legs and saw through their 
[02:46:00]  vaginas and penises in the Middle Ages.  I've never heard that.  That was your people back in the old years.  European days.  That was one of the methods.  They would open your legs.  Was that a torture method?  The Spanish Inquisition?  No, it wasn't a reward when they would saw through your grudge.  Did I have to ask if it was a torture?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm an idiot.  But, I mean, we've always been this crazy.  We've always been nuts.  But now we're, we're now more open about it.  Right.  We're just a little bit more open.  We're used to hide it better, I guess.  And we want to connect with each other.  We want to learn more about each other.  Do we really?  Yes.  Do we really want to learn about other people? 
[02:46:30]  We're a bunch of weird little animals coming out of holes.  I think we want to be heard more than we want to listen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  I like the fact that people will tweet things and just not even acknowledge what has been  written by other people.  Yeah, right.  It's not this exchange of ideas.  It's everyone yelling, please look at me.  It's a me, me, me mentality.  That's kind of what this whole thing has turned into.  And I don't know where it's headed from here, but it'll be interesting.  Well, it's like, there's always the comment sections on online versions of newspapers.  You'll see an article and then there'll be like a series and then they get into  arguments with you.  Fuck you.  You're an asshole. 
[02:47:00]  It's so weird.  It's all with fake names, by the way, which drives especially Jimmy.  Fake names they hate.  People have this just, they want to be heard.  And now more than ever, we were talking about when people used to have to get in touch with  a celebrity, even for a picture.  Clark Gable.  You wanted to fucking get a letter to Clark Gable.  You could write one.  The letter wasn't going to Clark Gable.  It was going to his people.  They were going to take a picture that he'd signed or they stamped and send it out.  You could never say, hey, Clark, love this movie you did.  Or I thought Gone with the Wind sucked. 
[02:47:30]  You know, whatever.  Now, you go to Twitter, you directly have access to these celebrities to go, your movie  sucked.  And he might just go, fuck you.  I think the movie was great.  It gives you this access to people that we never had before.  But it's cheapened celebrity in a way, particularly movie stars.  It used to be that Clark Gable was untouchable.  He was a god.  You were never getting to Clark Gable.  You were never going to see Clark Gable coming out of a bar drunk.  And that's all you, yeah, drunk. 
[02:48:00]  You weren't going to see that ever.  Camera in his face.  So, Clark, what are you doing tonight, man?  Hey, fuck you.  You don't give a damn.  We don't.  Well, it seemed Clark didn't give a damn that night about drinking.  Oh, they're all TMZ.  They're going crazy.  They're all stood around, like, appearing to just, like, ad-lib a conversation in the  office.  Oh, that's terrible.  Hey, here I am, just bad-mouthing some people.  That fucking idiot.  Done better than me.  That roach Harvey Levin just leaning over with his stupid beverage.  With his straw.  Oh, that's terrible.  But it has cheapened celebrity to the point where we don't have those iconic, you know, 
[02:48:30]  Humphrey Bogart.  That's not as special as it used to be.  No.  If John Wayne was on a talk show, that was a huge...  It was huge.  I mean, on a talk show now, it's like every star is on every talk show.  Every talk show, no matter how big they are.  All right, look, man.  It was a special day for us.  He just told the same anecdote.  How many anecdotes does he have in the making of the movie?  Just put us down.  Anyone could be on a talk show.  All right, well.  It was fun for us, Stephen.  It was true.  Anyone can.  We enjoyed it. 
[02:49:00]  Sorry about that.  I realize I've really insulted you that guy.  Sorry about that.  But it is an odd thing, and I think it's going to, as it moves forward, we're going  to see some more just weirdness out of humanity.  Yeah.  It's really strange.  I like what's going on here in North Korea, having this Kim Jong-il die, because I don't  know if it's...  Do you like this?  Yeah, I like that.  Well, you were in your day, huh?  Kim Jong-un.  I like Kim Jong-un.  Yeah.  28 years old, a little younger.  I think we're going to see a more hip North Korea. 
[02:49:30]  We're going to be, you know, they're going to be rocking the iPhones and the iPads.  Sure.  One of those Apple adverts.  Yes, yeah.  Where they're all just, you know, smiling people.  Yeah.  You know, they've used dead people in ads before.  It's going to be Kim Jong-il just, you know, using his iPads.  It's nice that there's only one word different in his name as well.  Like, we haven't got to change everything in our mindset.  It's Kim Jong-un.  What's the guy from Korea?  Kim Jong-un.  Kim Jong-un.  Un.  Un.  Un.  Yeah.  A lot of the stationery doesn't have to be changed.  Nice. 
[02:50:00]  Why not?  He'll put it in.  Yeah, exactly.  Put it in.  But he's 28.  So you're getting a younger leader.  I don't know when he's actually going to take power.  I think there might be some shenanigans going on over there before this kid actually goes in.  And you know this how?  Because the internet, all of my travels to North Korea.  He's on Twitter this morning.  He knows this shit now.  I know because I have a microphone in front of me.  And when I speak into it, what comes out of people's radios has to be true.  It's on the radio.  Of course, yeah.  So that's the only...  It was fascinating that the North Korea...  Like, it's such a fascinating place. 
[02:50:30]  Shut off from the rest of the world.  Unbelievable.  Even with the advent of all this social networking and mass communications.  I mean, even the Soviet Union at the time back then couldn't keep it all from info from  the West coming in.  China is having the same type of problem keeping their people in check because they see the  rest of the world.  But North Korea could shut down everything coming into that fucking country.  And do you remember that weird thing?  I was fascinated by that story where Kim Jong-il was a big movie buff.  And he kidnapped a husband and wife film directing team from, like, South Korea and kidnapped them 
[02:51:00]  and brought them to North Korea and made them make films.  That's hilarious.  It's just...  It's insane.  It's the best...  It's like the worst kind of James Bond villain.  Right, right.  A really dull James Bond movie.  He wants them to make a movie.  How long did they keep him there for?  They were there for years.  And eventually, I think, he foolishly let them go to, like, a film festival somewhere  else in the world.  And they're just running away.  So strange.  Wow.  And you can't make shitty films because that'll be your life. 
[02:51:30]  Imagine being so good at something that they steal you to make movies.  Like, I can't get into one in any fucking way.  How humiliating.  Waiting for a dictator to kidnap you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What I'm trying to do is be the English guy that people go to when they can't get Simon  Pegg.  Oh, yeah.  This is my...  This is what I'm trying to do.  You can work that out.  I'm hoping that would be like a rip-off version of Mission Impossible.  You know, like, Mission Difficult.  It's just difficult.  It's not impossible.  That guy is in Simon Pegg.  We got Merchant.  How well do you know Simon Pegg?  Pretty well.  Yeah?  I see you call him Peggy.  You gotta know the guy pretty well to call him Peggy. 
[02:52:00]  He's a lovely man, Simon Peggy.  He's fucking very good.  Yeah.  Really good.  Like, the first thing I saw him in, I think a lot of people were Shaun of the Dead.  And then you realize how much he had in making that movie, not just acting it.  It's like, wow, that's fucking smart.  Oh, he's fantastic.  Then you realize, why wasn't he around longer?  Was he big in England before Shaun of the Dead?  Well, he was pretty big, yeah.  I mean, particularly among comedy fans, yeah.  Right.  He did that show Spaced.  Did you ever see Spaced?  Yeah.  It was here for a little while.  Right.  Yeah, but it was one of those English shows.  People were like, meh.  Not quite one of the... 
[02:52:30]  It's no office.  The biggest...  It's no office.  One of the arguments I've had about The Office where I tell people Brent was a better fucking character than Archie Bunker.  Oh, please.  And people don't want to hear that shit here.  I love Archie Bunker.  He was brilliant.  But David Brent was a better, more believable human being.  Yeah, yeah.  More believable.  A more perfect character of an ass.  Yeah.  He just didn't have the racial stuff in Archie Bunker.  But I'd be with Ricky walking the street when that show was on, and people would come up and say, men would come up and say, I'm just like that guy you play.  See you later.  It was like a badge of honor.  They were proud of it. 
[02:53:00]  Why did you do that?  It was so bizarre.  It's like we always say, it didn't change anything.  There are still people like that behaving like that in offices now.  It makes no difference.  Where did you see people like that where you were able to convey it so easily?  I worked at the BBC.  It was like it there.  Middle management.  I bet if you work at NASA or the mob, it's still the same.  I just think people are all the same.  I was saying that years ago to Opie, it's like you have this impression that no matter where you work, there's a bunch of assholes and idiots.  But there's the next place up has got to be different. 
[02:53:30]  It'll be blissful.  And it's going to be amazing.  And people will know from looking at all the assholes at the lower end of the jobs how to do it when you get to the upper end.  But then as I kept progressing in my career, I realized, wow, everyone's stupid and this never changes the whole thing.  It never gets better.  But then you start thinking about shit you're not in, like the government and things like NASA and stuff, and realize, no, it's the same cubicle idiots.  That's the terrifying thing about it.  You know the people in power are exactly the same. 
[02:54:00]  And you realize, yeah, it's barely hanging together by a thread.  Of course, because also I think with politics, it's like it's that thing of who'd want to be a member of that.  You know, if you want to be in the club, you shouldn't be in the club.  It's like if you think, I mean, you know, God bless President Obama, but who wants to be the president?  It's insane.  The responsibility is crazy.  That's why I think the people that would be best suited to be president would never run for president.  They're too smart to look at that office and go, for the amount of money he's getting and the amount of aggravation, 
[02:54:30]  no one ever just pours accolades onto the president.  I mean, talk about receiving some bad mouthing on Twitter.  Does he go on Twitter?  Do you think, oh, my God, they really did.  That's a high policy.  You captured something, too, in the extras, too.  So you had this great way of capturing, like, the really arrogant, annoying side of a person,  but it was a complete person.  It was like he wasn't a caricature of an annoying guy.  And you had a great role in that as well as the agent.  But there was a real person there.  It's like, wow, you really feel for him sometimes, and you can understand why he's an asset. 
[02:55:00]  People used to say we were really cynical, and the shows we did were kind of black comedies,  and that they were cynical.  But I think there's always a real, I hope there's a warmth towards those characters.  Like, there is, even with Dave Rebent, like you were saying earlier,  we feel there's a humanity in them that is interesting to us,  that the worst people have something about them that is likable.  It's odd.  That's kind of interesting, and that friction is what's interesting.  You laugh at him.  You're definitely laughing at him as anybody else would, but you also feel bad, 
[02:55:30]  and you're thinking if that was, like, a real character, he would be the most pathetic thing.  Right.  And sad man to be walking around.  And another great line, when he fucking, he's trying to impress the new guy at the office,  and he tells Dawn that she's being fired, and then he has to confess and say it was a joke,  and she's like, you're a sad man.  You're a sad man.  But his response is, am I?  Like, that's such a real, the writing in that, it makes me sick it's so good.  Like, I would have tried to write a punchline, or fucking, when he's holding the dildo,  whose is this, and he's holding it in the girl's face, but there's no dildo puns, 
[02:56:00]  there's no dumb fucking jokes, it is just that awful moment.  And it's like, that's what great comedy is.  It's like, oh, Jesus.  And of course, when the answering machine falls on the garbage.  That's my favorite moment in the whole series.  It's one of the great...  I think it's the thing, if it wasn't done as a fake documentary,  a lot of that stuff wouldn't make sense, because it's the fake,  it's knowing that there's this camera crew there that he's showing off to.  He's showing off.  It's a huge thing.  And again, as we were saying, nothing changes.  Your reality TV, the number of people who go on reality TV, 
[02:56:30]  and it's like they think, having had no education,  I could, well then, I'm not going to look like an asshole.  No, I know how this works.  I'll be the one that comes off looking great.  It's incredible.  People keep volunteering to go on reality shows,  and keep on being made to look like dicks every week.  Do you like the American version of The Office?  I love it.  You do?  Do you like it as much as The British?  I mean, you guys are kind of, I guess, exec producers on it, right?  But I just wanted to sound like I was on TV.  So you like it as much as The British, or do you think it...  Well, I do, because I never could enjoy The British as a fan.  You know what I mean? 
[02:57:00]  Whereas I really enjoy it as a fan, The American Show.  You pretty much knew every line that was coming out.  Often, often I did.  Do you watch yourself and enjoy it?  And that's a corny question.  I can't bear it.  You can't?  I can't either.  Really?  Wow, that's weird.  I can't bear to hear myself on the radio,  or watch myself on TV, anything like that.  I just can't...  Because all I see is the mistakes.  Right.  The witty thing I should have said.  Yeah, yeah.  That is a weird thing,  because whenever I listen to replays of shows or something,  I never sound like the guy that's on the radio.  Like, I sound like, 
[02:57:30]  ah, they should throw me out at any minute.  But apparently, I guess to the listeners,  you sound like the guy on the radio,  because you're the guy on the radio.  Right.  And it's got to be the same on television.  You're looking,  and you're so taken out of the show,  because you're in it.  Of course, exactly.  And all you remember is the mechanics of it.  We had to break for lunch there,  if only we'd done a couple of takes.  Right.  Or I remember I was in a foul mood.  That's all I see.  All I see is the nuts and bolts of it.  Yeah, very hard.  Ten years down the road,  maybe I'll revisit.  It sounds good,  from what I've heard. 
[02:58:00]  It's not bad.  I literally have watched it so many times,  like, you know,  you don't even laugh at the joke,  because you know the joke.  Right.  But I just enjoy it  as watching a guy portray a fool.  So, like,  Rupert Pupkin was a great one.  De Niro did a great job.  Oh, man, yeah.  But that was more of a caricature,  and this is like a fucking,  a real documentary.  I mean, you know that.  And extras,  what a brilliant role to take on.  You never think about these fucking people.  But you mentioned that,  it's like a real documentary,  because we,  at the time,  there were real documentaries coming on,  and we were like,  we remember calling each other saying,  we can't compete with the real thing.  Real documentaries are, 
[02:58:30]  when they are good,  they are off the charts.  Did you see that one,  King of Kong?  Oh, yeah.  We love King of Kong.  Those characters you couldn't write.  Could not write it.  That guy,  it's like,  okay,  we want you to write a character.  It's like a video game guy.  It's years later.  He set the record.  Here he is.  What type of person would he be?  You couldn't write a big asshole like that.  Oh, Billy Mitchell.  Billy Mitchell is the king.  Billy Mitchell is the king.  A minor villain that anyone has ever.  It's fantastic.  Just the hair.  Oh, the ties.  The bad ties.  You can't write that.  There's a lot where he said something like, 
[02:59:00]  he said something like,  they say you learn a lot from losing.  I should try sometime.  He's all smug when he says it.  Unbelievable.  Not a hint of irony.  No.  No wink to the camera.  No.  That's what he believes.  He meant it.  He thinks people love.  Some people are getting mad  because we're talking about shows  that are old.  Yeah, we know.  Come on.  I've never gotten to talk to Stephen Merchant  about this masterpiece.  But we wanted to make sure people know  about Life's Too Short,  which is your new project. 
[02:59:30]  Right, Life's Too Short is a show we did  that's coming on HBO in February.  And this is a show we did  with the actor Warwick Davis.  Are you familiar with Warwick?  He was in Harry Potter  and Return of the Jedi.  And he's a little person.  And we worked with him on Extras  and Ricky kicked him in the face  on that show.  On TV, not in the dressing room.  Yeah.  And yeah, so it's a whole show  kind of following him.  Again, fake documentary star.  Ricky and I pop up as ourselves.  And a little like Extras,  we've got some celebrity names in it.  So Liam Neeson is in an episode  and Dirty Depp and Sting and people. 
[03:00:00]  And Liam Neeson is absolutely hysterical.  That fucking Liam Neeson clip  where he's, yeah,  talking about comedy.  Yeah, he wants to break into comedy  and so he's trying to do  some improv comedy  with Ricky.  It's hilarious.  It's one of the funniest fucking clips  I've seen on the internet.  Great.  Because it's so out of place.  Like, I didn't think  he had a sense of humor.  He's amazing.  He's absolutely amazing.  And you make like AIDS jokes  and shit.  It's just the least appropriate  comedy routine.  Is he funny though?  He's not trying,  it's not coming off like,  look, I'm being funny.  Right, right. 
[03:00:30]  But he's hilarious doing it.  Oh, I can't wait to watch this.  And it's not by accident.  Like, he knows what he's doing.  Oh, he knows what he's doing.  It's brilliant.  Really good.  He never had an opportunity  to do that before, obviously.  I guess not.  You know, he's always been  like the hard guy.  When you get someone  like that on a show,  their public image  is someone so intense,  Oscar Schindler,  that when you can make them  do things on TV,  it's insane.  Holy shit.  Life's too short  coming out on HBO.  Yeah, we had,  what's his name in here  a couple of weeks ago.  Fuck. 
[03:01:00]  He was in The Professional.  Gary Oldman.  Oh, Gary Oldman, yeah.  Gary Oldman was in here.  The nerd of us  to forget his name.  I know.  You know what it is?  When you're trying  to think of a name,  you can never think  of a fucking name.  But he was in here  and not known  as being a funny guy,  but he was funny  and just genuinely fun  to be around  and telling his stories  and laughing and stuff.  All I'm thinking  is the guy  in The Professional,  you know.  Right, exactly.  Get everyone here.  What do you mean?  Everyone!  Taking those  popper drugs and shit. 
[03:01:30]  When the old lady  comes out,  the old lady comes out,  he goes,  get back inside  and then he fucking  shoots the window  next to her.  I told you  to get back inside.  It's fucking great.  That movie, I think,  was, what,  12 years old?  Yeah, yeah.  There's some people  on your email  that are really  going to do that.  Yes.  Talked about Clark Gable.  Well, yeah,  Clark Gable.  You know,  The Wizard of Oz.  Talking about  little people.  The Wizard of Oz  had a few.  Do you have an opening act  and you just stand up?  Or do you just go out  and do the 90 minutes  of your song?  I'm normally trying  to have an opening act.  You do, right? 
[03:02:00]  It helps.  Just to sort of  ease into it and stuff.  I'm jumpy about these.  Nah, you'd be fine, man.  You really will.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just,  I love American comedy.  I grew up  adoring American comedy,  particularly that sort  of New York  wise-ass  Jewish humor,  you know,  the Woody Allen  and that stuff,  Jack Benny,  and I just,  I just always,  there's something  about the American,  the way Americans speak,  the sort of rhythms  of American speech  that lend itself  to a particular kind  of humor.  Like, there's a great  Woody Allen joke  in Broadway,  Danny Rose, 
[03:02:30]  where he's saying,  my aunt,  not an attractive woman,  she looked like  something you'd buy  in a live bait store.  We would never say  something in England  like live bait store.  It would have a kind  of long,  like a fishing tackle  equipment supplier.  Do you know what I mean?  There's nothing kind  of neat and compact  about English English.  But the English comics,  you guys have this type  of delivery  and cadence  in the voice  that is conducive  to English comics.  I guess so.  Which is that whole,  you know,  like,  almost like you're  looking down your nose 
[03:03:00]  at us.  Right.  You know,  but it's funny,  I mean,  and completely acceptable.  Fawlty Towers,  I thought,  was hilarious.  1975.  Yes,  let's go back.  1975.  Fawlty Towers  was a huge influence  on me,  because John Cleese  grew up right near  where I grew up  in Bristol  in England,  and he was a big  influence on me,  because the way he was  smart but physical.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Again,  the funny walks  and stuff,  amazing.  The way he would  deliver his lines,  and just when he'd be mad  how detailed he'd get 
[03:03:30]  into,  like,  just giving it to somebody,  and then maybe losing  his train of thought  and getting pissed  at himself at the end of it.  Well,  we were talking about  David Brent,  and I think there's  a long tradition  of kind of American  sitcom characters,  sorry,  English sitcom characters  that have that,  he's a very similar type,  you know,  and I think what was  different in those days  was that they aspired  to be in high society.  That was the thing.  In the 60s and 70s,  you wanted to be,  you know,  hanging out with royals  and the mayor.  Now,  I think it's  you want to be celebrity,  and I think that's  what David Brent was  in a way,  that the new thing,  the new urge  is to be famous.  It's like,  that's the high society 
[03:04:00]  of the one need.  Well,  he used performer lingo,  which just,  it makes you fucking,  it humiliates you for him.  Like,  when he's telling Neil,  he goes,  just go ahead and talk  and then bring me on.  Like,  bring me on.  Like,  he's a fucking comic.  And those awful jokes,  he's like a paper,  blew away,  the paper shop blew away,  and it's just,  it's bombing horribly,  and the phone rings.  He goes,  all right,  that's why you're not  enjoying it,  because,  oh,  shut up.  Perfection.  It's perfect uncomfortability.  So do you,  you do get a little nervous 
[03:04:30]  when you go on stage?  I think I will here in the States,  just because I,  as I say,  I'm sort of inexperienced  performing in America.  I do some gritty New York humor,  like,  I'll go out there,  I'll just go like,  oh,  these cabs,  what are these guys  from crazy places?  That'll do it.  Oh,  yeah.  Imagine if he had  that exact joke written.  He killed,  because he said it right.  Can I get rid of this?  I'm not above  some cheap observations.  I'll do anything.  When I'm up on stage,  I'm so desperate  to make people laugh,  I will pander.  Just go anywhere.  I don't care. 
[03:05:00]  Good for you.  Anything.  You know,  it's all very easy  in the writing room,  trying to be really clever  and smart,  but when you're out on stage  and they're just looking at you.  I'm dying to see it.  I'm going to come  one of those nights,  either tomorrow or Wednesday,  Stephen Merchant at Town Hall.  I guess they're 8 o'clock show.  It's an amazing venue  on 43rd Street,  and it's a very intimate place  to see a show.  I didn't even know  you did stand-up.  I'm happy to hear  that you do it.  Thank you, man.  Because I would love  to come and...  Yes, you're welcome.  Yeah, listen,  I'll probably get you  half-priced seats.  I appreciate that.  Oh, nice.  Two for one.  Yes, I've already scalped  for double,  so I'll just take him 
[03:05:30]  and sell him back  to the man.  Is the animated show  on HBO?  Yes, that starts again  next year,  so I'm so terrible  at keeping track  of what I'm doing.  Yeah, what's going on?  It's just like,  I know I did it,  so it's going to  turn up somewhere.  That's done really well, too.  That's a fun thing to do.  Yeah, it's just...  I don't know  who's doing the animating,  but it's amazing.  They're great,  and they're so inventive,  and they just take it  into another realm.  Because the podcast itself  is very funny,  and then you add  that visual element  of the cartoons,  and it just becomes  ridiculous.  Well, Kyle Pilkington 
[03:06:00]  has such a sort of  vivid imagination  and I think...  Has it been on the one  where he comes up  with a movie for Tom Cruise  where Tom Cruise  gets in another person's brain  or something?  I've seen a couple  of those themes  where he comes up  with movies.  Every movie idea he has  is always the same.  Someone going in  another person's brain.  Another brain.  Carl Rawls.  The one where, yeah,  the woman was dead,  but you could take  her brain out  and put it in  someone else's body  so the love can continue.  He just comes out 
[03:06:30]  with shit.  I was saying  when we weren't  on the air earlier,  that you could ask  him a question  or put him  in a situation  where you would  99% of the time  know what anyone  would do  and you're almost  saying like,  oh, I know  what line's coming next  and he will go  so far  in another direction  that...  It's never what you think.  No, and that's  what makes it  so funny  and just so  perplexing  to watch him.  I think as a  comedy writer as well,  it's like you,  you're sort of  constrained a bit  by your own  intelligence  and your own smartness.  Whereas he's just 
[03:07:00]  so ill-informed  he will come out  of Leftville  with such...  I think we spoke  last time  about how he was  talking about  the pyramids  and he was saying  it's such a terrible  design, you know,  kind of huge living room,  tiny bedrooms.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like,  I know it's a mausoleum  so it would never  occur to me  that it's a house.  Of course.  Why would you  even think that?  His take on bugs  gets me every time.  He's obsessed with bugs.  Does he hate them  or love them?  No, he kind of  has an affinity for him  but he thinks 
[03:07:30]  about how they think.  He can't conceive  of the idea  that a bug  is just doing  what it does.  It's not thinking  like a human.  I've got to lift  this twig today.  Yeah, it's always  thinking that.  I didn't sleep well,  I had a fight  with my wife.  He's obsessed  with the idea that they...  Well, he's just  one of many  in the colony  and it upsets him  that he's...  And you're like,  no, he doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  He's not thinking.  How do you know?  Of course, that's it.  It's just...  It really is great.  Ants and Bees  don't give a shit  about individuality.  No.  Couldn't care less.  He's great though. 
[03:08:00]  What a brilliant find.  I've never heard him  because I've never  heard the podcast.  I know who he is.  Idiot Abroad  is a great show too.  Oh, when they sent him  to, what was it,  the Dead Sea?  Right.  And he's floating  next to snot.  There's a snot fucking wad  because it's apparently  disgusting.  There's so much salt  in it that everything floats.  So he just got in there  and he's like,  oh, I'm floating  but he's talking  on the phone  and as he's doing it  there's these old men  just hacking up shit  and there's a blob  of mucus  that's right next to him 
[03:08:30]  and he's trying  to shoo it away from him.  It all just hangs out  on the surface.  It was so disgusting.  But just the way  he handled it  was, again, hilarious.  You can float on it?  Oh my God.  You can't sink  if you wanted to.  Can you go underwater there?  I guess for a second.  It's really salty though.  Yeah, it's really salty.  Yeah, close your mouth  if you do it.  Just want to float more.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's a real ocean, right?  Oh yeah, more amazing  about that show  was Machu Picchu.  I said it to you  last time.  He didn't even have  the desire to check it out.  Well, that I find weird.  That lack of curiosity. 
[03:09:00]  I'm like, how do you get  a total lack of curiosity?  How are you not  curious enough  to now walk around?  He saw it from afar.  He's like,  yeah, this is close enough.  Well, his argument now  is with high-definition TV,  why would you go anywhere?  I guess there's a...  I understand that rationale.  I mean,  if you don't want to eat the food  and meet with the local people,  then yeah,  I guess you'll see it  in better conditions.  I'm obsessed  because I want to go  to Machu Picchu  and here's Carl.  He's there  and almost there  and decided he did enough  for the TV show  and just wanted to get down.  I'm like, what? 
[03:09:30]  Who does that way?  Carl.  Well, I get furious with him  because he does stuff  which I would love to do,  you know, swimming with sharks.  Yeah.  Part of the thing with the show  is we slightly screw with him  so we told him  he was going to swim  with dolphins  and when he got there  it was sharks  which kind of annoyed him  somewhat.  It annoys him so much  just the littlest things  which is hilarious too.  No, he's remarkable.  You've had great success  in the States.  I'm happy to see it.  Thank you.  Really happy.  It's always happy to see guys  that are really smart  and funny doing  clever stuff.  Yeah, man.  Really, really original shit. 
[03:10:00]  It's so good to see.  We're starting to get  more clever stuff on TV  finally but it's not easy.  Oh, there's still so much.  No, I know.  It's not easy.  I think the grass  is always greener though.  I think, you know,  there's so much terrible stuff  on UK TV.  Sure, yeah.  You see the best of it  hopefully but, you know,  I still admire American TV.  I don't think we're doing  stuff of the quality  of Mad Men  or The Sopranos  on British TV.  You know, I think  just enjoy what you've got, guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, man.  If nothing else,  just take that message  away from you today.  They have taken  more of an attitude  that you get in film 
[03:10:30]  on television here  which is, thank God,  and I think it's because  the stations knew  they couldn't compete anymore.  I think a lot of the stuff  that you used to see  in American cinema  in like the 70s,  kind of brave,  personal movies,  five easy pieces  and stuff like that.  Brian's song.  Brian's song.  It feels like  that's what they're making  on HBO  and cable channels  and stuff  whereas American cinema  I guess is perhaps  less adventurous  than it used to be.  Yeah, and with FX  and channels that allow  for a little more  graphic content. 
[03:11:00]  Nudity, ideally.  Who doesn't like it?  This is one of the reasons  I never watch animated films  because there's never  any nudity.  I know.  Any nudity.  How great would Up  have been with a clit  in it?  Well, English television  has had nudity in it  for years  and that to us,  especially growing up,  when I used to put on  Channel 13,  which is our educational  television here  and brought us things  like Monty Python  and whatnot,  there was plenty  of nudity in that.  Well, there was  occasional nudity.  There was a lot of underwear.  Believe me, 
[03:11:30]  it was a lot more  than we were getting  on any channels  in the United States.  Aside from maybe  Ronan Martin's laughing,  we'd get Goldie Hawn  in a bikini painted  in psychedelic colors.  But other than that,  you know,  you could get,  even if it was that  kind of clip art shit  they used to do  on Monty Python  where they'd have  the nude woman.  It's like,  for that age,  at that time,  it was like,  fuck,  I didn't have the internet.  This was huge.  Wasn't Benny Hill  more sexual  than Monty Python?  Yeah.  It was a nudity,  though,  but it was running around  girls chasing him  in their underwear.  Yes, giant tits 
[03:12:00]  in their underwear.  We loved Benny Hill.  Is that kind of hack  for you guys?  How old is that now?  It was always fascinating  that Benny Hill  was huge over here.  I mean,  he was big in England  as well,  but it's such an odd...  Was it hacked  for you guys?  It became an ironic  thing, though, here.  It wasn't like,  I don't think  we were watching it  like, wow,  this is...  It was kind of  a goofy old guy.  But also,  it was titillating  because, you know,  this was before  the internet  and everything else.  That's how we got  to see our tits.  The little stupid  old man  just hitting his head.  It's very funny.  I mean,  it was kind of wacky. 
[03:12:30]  There must be a lot  of men of a certain age  who have been  kind of slightly corrupted  sexually by...  That was their only  exposure to women.  Yeah, the big nurse...  The nurses with the big boobs.  Yeah, it was always  nurses chasing him.  Yeah, fast motion.  It was some sick shit.  Yeah, maybe that's  the whole thing.  The phobia of nurses.  I was surprised  to find out he was gay.  I didn't know that.  What?  I did not know that, yeah.  Well, you're making  implications.  Yeah, I've heard that.  I know he sort of  died quite sort of lonely  and in a little  sort of council house,  you know,  with like no sort of money  or his money  was squirreled away 
[03:13:00]  under the mattress  or something.  There was something  about those guys  from that age  who'd grown up  sort of on the stage  and stuff  who were just upset.  Like money was...  They just wouldn't  put it in a bank.  They couldn't trust a bank.  Yeah, yeah.  They grew up in the 30s  who just,  you have to hang on  to your money to die.  You're holding your money  like an old prospector.  They're going to end up  in another depression  and lose it all.  Just put it in my mattress,  ticking.  Yeah.  Wait, was he a stage actor?  He's a stage comedian.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I guess our equivalent  of sort of vaudeville  they would have started on.  You know what I like  from England too?  We had him in Chris Morris  I think he's really good. 
[03:13:30]  Chris Morris is a genius.  Oh my God, we love this.  He's brilliant, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  He, that Four Lions  was fucking...  You didn't see Four Lions  but I probably  yeah, it was amazing.  Four Lions was amazing.  It didn't do well here,  unfortunately.  Why would it?  It was a great movie.  It was a comedy  about suicide bombers.  Suicide bombers, yeah.  He didn't hold back.  Odd subject to...  It was a hilarious movie, man.  Really good.  It was like,  I wanted to cheer  when it was over.  I was watching my apartment  and I was like, good.  They didn't...  You figure they're  not going to fuck this up.  Like every 20 minutes  and a half hour  and I'm like,  he didn't fuck it up yet.  He didn't fuck it up yet. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, we...  Don't go for the happy ending.  We sort of got to wrap up  because he's doing  Unmasked with Ronnie.  What time is it?  Oh, Ronnie B's great, man.  You'll love him.  He starts as soon as  he's done here.  Oh.  Yeah, we got to get  out of here anyway.  It's after 10, all right.  Hi, everyone.  Well, Stephen,  should we plug tonight?  Yes.  I'm sorry, tomorrow  and Wednesday night  he will be at Town Hall.  I guess you can get tickets  at Ticketmaster,  I'm going to assume.  And the Patrice O'Neill,  just so you know,  the audio for Patrice  is 16 hours on this show,  the special audible.com 
[03:14:30]  slash Patrice.  All the money  goes to his family.  So it's five bucks  for each four-hour clip.  Don't be a chiseler.  It's $20  and all the money  goes to his family.  Yeah.  And Stephen Merchant.  What else would you  want to promote?  Twitter, maybe.  SM Hello Ladies.  Sure.  Listen, I know  you've done more than  I could have hoped for, guys.  I love coming on the show.  It's great.  Town Hall tomorrow  and Wednesday, is it?  Tuesday, Wednesday.  Tuesday, Wednesday.  Let's just see that.  I'm going to show up  and heckle  because that helps the comedian. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  They know that.  You ass.  I hate audience members.  It's amazing.  I'm entertaining people  who I just fucking,  I want to burn a life.  I get a self-ticket.  Stephen Merchant.  Thank you.  Thanks, Stephen.  Thanks, guys.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. </pre>
