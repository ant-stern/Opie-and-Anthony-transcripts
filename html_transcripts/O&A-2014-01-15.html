<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics.  It began with a discussion of a viral marketing video for "Devil Baby Attack," focusing on the humorous reactions of viewers, particularly racial differences in responses, and the poor quality of the animatronics.  This transitioned into a detailed and highly comedic analysis of Mark Gormley's hilariously bad music video "Without You," highlighting its poor green-screen effects, awkward performances, and the jarring contrast between Gormley's pleasant singing voice and unsettling appearance.

The hosts then previewed upcoming interviews with Ice Cube and Dr. Ian Smith, and briefly praised a Jimmy Fallon and Bruce Springsteen skit parodying Chris Christie.  This led into an extended in-studio segment featuring Dr. Ian Smith, promoting his book "Super Shred" and discussing weight loss methods, recipes, and smoothies.  A humorous anecdote about a past bet and unpaid money between Dr. Smith and the hosts was also recounted.  The discussion included jokes targeting Dr. Smithâ€™s medical credentials and the book's quality.

Dr. Smith's presence segued into a discussion about E-Rock's weight and a weight-loss challenge, with Dr. Smith confronting E-Rock about his unhealthy habits, specifically his consumption of flavored water.  A heated exchange followed, culminating in E-Rock accepting a $500 incentive and additional support to participate in the challenge. A $1000 weight-loss competition between E-Rock and Roland was then set up, with their starting weights recorded.  The segment also included unrelated discussions on a banned pro-gun Super Bowl commercial, a controversial Chicago Cubs mascot, a homophobic rant by a Westboro Baptist Church member, and Robert De Niro's perceived decline in film quality.  Numerous crude jokes and offensive remarks peppered the discussion.

A subsequent segment focused on questioning Dr. Smith's medical credentials, particularly his MD claim.  Speculation surrounded his Harvard education and presidential council position, with listeners calling in to offer various perspectives.  The hosts referenced a Wikipedia page mentioning a "mushroom stamping" incident involving E-Rock and Dr. Smith, framing the conflict more as emotional than factual.  A bet was placed on the outcome of E-Rock's weight loss challenge.  This segment also included a highly sexually explicit pre-recorded video dating profile from a staffer, "Daniel Bobo Curlin,"  announcements of a t-shirt design contest, and a new Opie and Anthony podcast featuring Jim Norton discussing animals.

The show then featured a substantial interview with Ice Cube, promoting *Ride Along*.  He discussed his collaboration with Kevin Hart, the film's inspiration, his experiences with police ride-alongs, his early career, the reality behind his violent lyrics, his perspective on the East Coast/West Coast rap rivalry, his continued relevance, his upbringing in South Central Los Angeles, and maintaining authenticity.  He also touched upon a documentary about Archie Black. A Milwaukee police officer who provided security for the Westboro Baptist Church called in, leading to a discussion of anti-gay laws in Nigeria.

A later Ice Cube segment focused on his role as a director, building a loyal team, handling employee firings, and anecdotes about near-loss of belongings in an airport.  He extensively discussed the N.W.A. biopic, pre-production challenges, casting difficulties (including considering his son), and learning about the band's history, particularly their difficult relationship with manager Jerry Heller.  He shared personal stories about Eazy-E's illness and death.  He also covered his social media presence, his preference for slapping over punching, and his response to online criticism.  After Ice Cube's departure, Opie and Anthony discussed a past on-air incident, compared it to a Sam Roberts incident, briefly mentioned a video of a young Ron Bennington and a news segment about shock jocks (including Fez Whatley), discussed Ron and Ron's radio show, and previewed upcoming guests (Bob Kelly, Jerry Springer, and possibly Jimmy Kimmel), concluding with promotional announcements and discussion of childhood terms for diarrhea and parenting anecdotes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning!  Oh, there we go. Got a very, very busy day.  And we're off!  We are off. Off and running.  It is now post time!  Yeah.  January 15th. My God, man.  What the hell?  I don't know.  How did that happen?  I don't mind.  We got that video.  Oh, the Mark Gormley. 
[00:00:30]  We were just watching some Mark Gormley getting all set for the morning.  That guy's fantastic.  Who is Mark Gormley?  I don't know.  And yes, and Devil Baby Attack.  Devil Baby Attack is hilarious.  I saw you pop that up there as well.  And what, it's an advertisement for a movie?  Yeah, it was one of those kind of, you know,  Rosemary's Baby, Devil Baby kind of a thing coming out.  I tweeted last night, and most people go,  holy fuck, this is hilarious.  And then, of course, there has to be,  ugh, you made me watch an advertisement for a movie! 
[00:01:00]  Like, what is wrong with these people?  Go out and get some air.  They made an amazingly horrible animatronic baby.  Horrible?  Yeah, I mean, it's like literally horrible to look at.  Yeah.  It's scary.  Some say it looks like Jim Norton.  Oh.  Oh, that must be adorable.  It's terrible.  I think we've got to superimpose Jim Norton's face on this thing.  Aw.  A lot of it makes me look silly.  And, yeah, they just roll it around, remote radio control,  and let it sit there.  Well, rolling it around New York was silly, 
[00:01:30]  but it's a great setup shot.  And it's a good way to get it in position.  Yeah, because no one's going to buy a, you know,  a stroller just rolling around on it.  Right.  But it looks hilarious as it's just rolling around.  But then they stop it, and they have a baby crying sound in it,  so people go up, and they're like,  why is this stroller got a crying baby and no one's around it?  Yeah.  And when they get close,  the fucking animatronic baby sits up real quick and goes,  Yeah, it's being controlled by remote.  Yeah, and it just scares the shit out of people.  And once again, you know, black people just, 
[00:02:00]  I don't know, do they like being scared?  Whether they like it or not?  They get scared way more than white people.  Black people are hilarious when they're getting scared.  They run away, they jump.  Oh, it's fantastic.  And did you see the one guy that has to be a serial killer?  He doesn't react at all?  He didn't react.  He just stood there.  That's even more creepy.  Are we going to throw this up on our Facebook page?  We probably did already.  All right, O&A show for Devil Baby Attack, 
[00:02:30]  which it's going everywhere, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, a lot of people.  Let's take a quick peek at this.  Devil Baby.  Devil Baby Attack.  Very, very scary.  Imagine that thing sitting up and looking at you.  It's fucking crazy.  And they show how it's made.  Very high tech.  Yes.  That thing looks fucking scary looking, man.  That would scare the living fuck out of me right there. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, fuck yeah.  I would jump.  I ain't frontin'.  So there's a stroller rolling around by itself.  Which is silly.  Some key New York places.  It's so creepy looking.  People love getting scared. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, that guy doesn't even respond.  People love watching other people get scared. 
[00:04:00]  It's so creepy.  It's so creepy.  Oh, fuck.  It's so creepy.  It's so creepy.  It's so creepy.  Yeah, and then it gives the finger the shot of it going through the pigeons with the pigeons flying  That's pretty hilarious, and then at the fucking the last 10 seconds is an ad for the movie not even five seconds and people  I didn't know that was an ad for a movie. Who cares? Yeah, I had no idea. What a great publicity stunt 
[00:04:30]  I'll never see that movie probably. I don't want I don't go watch the scary movies for the most part  So what a great marketing guerrilla marketing tactic for us for the movie. It's fantastic  There should be a little bit more of the movie though because the movie I have zero interest in the movie  Yeah, yeah, I think that's a funny. I think they probably will do some follow-ups basically  Yeah, let's do it's face. You like that chip fuck. Yeah, that's the one I was watching 
[00:05:00]  But you're watching the other guy I thought to mark gormley. What is fucking mark gormley? He started tweeting you  I heard I don't know whether it's really him or not.

[00:10:00]  Which leads me to believe it's a lake  Right  Not even like an ocean or anything  It's right where Mrs. Voorhees was murdered  It's stagnant water  Yeah, stagnant water  Stagnant grayish water  And then this idiot who was filming this video  Is filming right into the sun  So he came to see her face  Oh, that was on purpose, Opie  Oh, all right  I wonder if she was a girl that he likes  And he's like, I'll get you the music video  I'll get you the music video  Because she's not bad looking  Oh, she stinks  Do you think her body's nice?

Instead of just listening  What the guy's saying  And he needs to move around  A little bit  The voice in the song  Does not fit  What he looks like either  I think it does  Do you think?

Yeah  I love how  Fallon is just like a kid in a candy store with this stuff  Like he's not just having these legends do bits  He's like  No no no I'll sing with you  I'll get in there  And I'll fucking dress all wacky  And right next to you  He's singing the lead as Bruce is kind of his sidekick  But then Bruce is having fun  Going on  I have to take a leak  He kind of got used to that on SNL 
[00:27:00]  Where he'd dress up with somebody  And impersonate him  And then they'd walk on the stage  Because that's got to be fucking jarring  To have to impersonate someone  That's like right in the room  Same thing with McCartney  Yeah  Yeah  And for McCartney to do that  Yeah  What happened?  Bruce did three songs last night  Yeah  On the show or just for the audience?  Which one did you come during?  Right  All new songs  All new songs  All new ones  Yeah thanks Bruce  Tom Morello  Thanks Bruce  Tom Morello is playing with Bruce Frankenstein 
[00:27:30]  He's part of the E Street band now  What?  Yeah  When did that happen and why?  Well he's part of the album  He's in the new album  Wow  Okay  He did like eight songs  For it goes to Tom Joad  High Hope  Joad?  Yeah Joad  What?  For it goes to Tom Joad  And High Hope  He was in that?  He takes the lead  Oh I like that  I like that album  It's a brand new one  Yeah  And he did a  What's the new album about?  It's some songs that he left out of the previous albums  Right  And some new songs 
[00:28:00]  Very cool  It's good  Of course it's good  Well you know  You know what I was watching last night?  Fuck Bruce  Whatever  A little  Daryl Hall does this thing where he  At his house  Nice  He just fucking like  VH1 is a good one  Jams  At his house with people  So he had Todd Rundgren over  And some shit  Well regardless  I'm not  I never liked Todd Rundgren  You know what?  Let me tell you something  Except for bang on the drum  I'm not a fan  I wasn't a fan of them  I'm not a fan of like the music  Like that they were even playing 
[00:28:30]  Right  But the idea that they're just out  In this fucking giant backyard thing  Just playing  It was kind of a cool setup  It's a great show  That they had  It is a pretty goddamn  Entertainment is completely out of control  Yeah  Because now you could do your own thing  You don't need anyone anymore  Because I'm sure a lot of these ideas were pitched  But these snobs out there in Hollywood  Or here in New York  Were like  That don't make sense  So they're doing it on their own  And they're being very successful with it  Yep  Right?  Don't need any of those fucking people anymore  How's the show go?  It's just kind of in his backyard 
[00:29:00]  Like there's a deck  And it was by a lake  And then it's just a whole band of people there  His friends and shit  Playing keyboard and guitar and stuff  And then they just do each other's songs  They fucking do new songs  Just fucking jam shit like that  Do they talk at all too?  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  Is it sort of like a reality show?  Yeah, yeah  Kind of like that  You know  It was kind of cool  Nice  And  It's on VH1?  VH1 or VH1 class  Yeah, it's like 
[00:29:30]  Daryl  What's it called?  Daryl's house  Daryl's house  I gotta check that out  Yeah, it was pretty fucking cool  It was on at the dentist  I never would have watched it  But I'm sitting in the old dentist chair  And that was on  I'm like  Alright, this is kind of cool  Yeah, you hear a knock on the door  He goes  Hey, John Fuller D  Come on in  Hey, look who's here  Oh, really?  Yeah  And then they start playing the songs  See, that reminds me of a show  That I pitched  Oh, shit  It was  I was gonna bring comedians  Into my kitchen  And we're calling it  Just Riffin'  Oh, wow  R-I-F-F-I-N 
[00:30:00]  Apostrophe  Not Riffin?  No, Just Riffin'  Uh-huh  Me and the guy  Just riff on anything  That's pretty good  Whatever you want  And like  You guys go back and forth  And people write in  Like they hand  They put like  Regular U.S. mail  Suggestions  For things to riff on  U.S. mail  What?  A postcard?  Yeah, we open them up  And we just start riffing  I like it  Yeah  Like crockpots  Alright  Give me an example  I don't want to spoil the surprise  But we'll do like  An hour and 25  On crockpots  Oh, my God  Imagine sitting through  An hour and 25 
[00:30:30]  Of crockpots  Oh, what a chore  That would be exhausting  Yes  Yeah, there's little lulls  In the action  Yeah, yeah  It's terrible  Check out No Can Do  From that show with Daryl  Yeah  That's what someone's saying  Hmm  Eh, well  You know  I'll try that on my own  And then  What else did I say  Oh, my God  There's that fucking  Milius documentary  On Epix  Fuck, is that good

No  He wrote  It was only like  A quick aside  And Spielberg 
[00:31:30]  Called up John Milius  And said  Uh, I need more of this  I thought that was  A little improv  And it was  Well, here's the thing  There were rumors  That that was an improv thing  He wrote ten pages  Wow  And, and then Robert Shaw  Was like  This is just too much  Right  Uh, so  Then Robert Shaw  Whittled it down  Edited it  Down to five pages  But it's still  John Milius' work  No, no kidding  He wrote, uh  Red Dawn  He wrote fucking, um  Apocalypse Now  Wow  Screenplay guy for

Yeah  So  What's the documentary about?  It's about him  And, uh  How he was kind of  An outcast  Uh  From Hollywood  After a while  Because of his ideology  And he was kind of 
[00:32:30]  A loose cannon  Is he dead?  Kinda  No, but he had  A fucking stroke  Oh  Wink, wink, wink  Yeah  Did he still write though?  Sorry to ruin the movie for you  Mmm  Wow  He's in therapy  You know  Trying to get that  Uh  Back together  Oh boy  But, uh  It was pretty fucking cool  Great, like  Just seeing what this guy  Was involved in  During the 70s  And, uh  His ideology  So he  He leaned, uh  He leaned a little right  He, um  After a stroke  Oh, jeez

[00:33:30]  Robocop  Mm-hmm  Like all these iconic  Fucking  70s and 80s  Uh movies  Really cool  And I was like  Who the fuck is this guy?  Right  There he is  All over everything  Well very good  I'm gonna have to check that out  That's a good one too  I think we're  We got a very  Fast paced show today  Because we got lots  Lots of stuff going on  Yeah  We got to take our first break  Because Dr. Ian Smith is here  Our old friend  Oh shit  Food  And um  Where's Iraq?  Iraq still doesn't like  Dr. Ian Smith  Can't stand him 
[00:34:00]  Still can't stand him?  Hates him  No  Because he made him look like  A fucking asshole  During the diet segment  Of five or seven years ago  Where's Iraq?  Let's hear it in his own words  Real fast  Eric come down the hall  Or wherever the fuck you are  Here he comes  I know  Uh Dr. Ian Smith's book  Is called  Uh Super Shred  It's in bookstores now  Looks like the Duke  So we'll have um  Dr. Ian Smith on next  As we wait for  Here comes Iraq  Lumbering  Why would he hurry?  Down the hall  Live radio show  Lumbering 
[00:34:30]  But he's trying to stay in shape  Wouldn't you get a quick job?  Jogging  Oh my god  Why wouldn't you get a quick jogging  If you're trying to like  Uh eat better  And get in shape  Baby steps  Baby steps  Oh god  What's the issue with you  And Dr. Ian Smith  This goes back many many years  Yeah well um  Back in 2007  I took his fat smash challenge  Lost it by like a pound or two  Um  Oh that's right  There was a certain um  Goal weight  Wait how much  That Iraq was supposed to achieve  How much were you supposed to uh lose?  I  Two pounds 
[00:35:00]  Twenty  No we heard a lot of clear  I was like twenty twenty five pounds  Somewhere in there  Alright  And you were a pound short more or less  Yeah a pound or two short  Alright  And how much was he gonna give you?  He gave me five hundred dollars to hold on to  Five hundred dollars  Right  And then we were supposed to do the end of the bit  Where he would come in  I'd give him the five hundred  Uh he didn't come  He didn't show up  Uh huh  Then when he finally did show up  Yeah  He was sitting at the office at K-Rock 
[00:35:30]  While you guys were talking about something else  And then he left because he didn't want to wait anymore  And then we didn't see him again until 2010  Wow  Oh yeah we kind of never got to him that day  Yeah  And he was a little mad about that  A little miffed  Then 2010 he comes in  That happens  Yeah  Uh with Patrice here  And uh we bring up the whole  I owe him five hundred dollars thing  Uh huh  And he's trying to act hard in front of Patrice  And he's demanding his five hundred bucks  And uh so I went down 
[00:36:00]  Got the five hundred dollars to pay him back  And he decides to give it to Sam  Oh right  And let Sam decide what happens with the five hundred dollars  Right  So Sam if I'm remembering this right  Um in all fairness  Did he trade himself?  He decided that I needed to learn a life lesson  Right  Right  And thought it was in everyone's best interest  If Sam kept the five hundred dollars for himself  Right  Right  But while all that was going on 
[00:36:30]  He just was kind of dickish  Not Sam  Yeah  He's always dickish  But Dr. Smith was kind of dickish  Throughout the whole thing  Ah okay  And uh I heard you were accusing him  Of not even being a real doctor  Well everything I looked up on him  Says that no he went to uh  Hold on I got the clip  Oh  I got a couple quick clips here  All right  Yeah we'll get into that later  I'll tell you what Eric said in office  What did he say?  Uh his books came  And Eric goes  Oh  This is new audio by the way 
[00:37:00]  Yeah this just happened  Where's this from?  This just happened  Like a couple days ago  Yeah okay  And um you know  He's here to promote his new book  And E-Rock has something to say  About his new book here  Listening to  By the way  I'm sorry  I gotta just say  Listening to Roland  On a recording  Is like trying to decipher  A fucking cockpit voice recording  Right  It's like  What did he  What was that?  Did I hear that right?  Got to hear it a couple times  He's good for the replays  His words  Are like their 
[00:37:30]  You know what his words  Come out like?  Yeah  Those videos you see  On the news  Of the icy road  Where the cars  Are just sliding  And smashing  Into each other  That's what his words do  Yeah we'll get into that later  I'll tell you what Eric said  In the office  What did he say?  Uh his books came  And Eric goes  Oh  I saw the $7 bin  At Costco  It was  So Dr. Ian Smith's books  Came in  Saw the Southern bin in Costco  You don't speak Roland  I don't  In the bargain bin at Costco  He saw the Dr. Ian Smith book  For $7  Saw the bargain bin  Saw the bargain bin 
[00:38:00]  I find myself restating  Everything he says  On the post show  Because I feel guilty  If I don't  When I'm driving home  And I hear Roland speaking  I get mad  If you don't reiterate  What he says  Because I can't  Fucking understand it  Ian Smith's books  Came in  And you said  I saw that in the $7 bin at Costco  $7.98 at Sam's Club  So you don't  Are we taking shots?  You don't consider him a doctor  A lot of people  Don't consider him a doctor  What makes you say that?  Because I guess  According to his bio  He went to a medical school 
[00:38:30]  Did four years  But then never  Continued to get the MD, PhD  Whatever  That makes you the doctor  So he doesn't have a doctorate  I believe that's correct  Wow  I really hope that he does  And E-Rock is now  In legal trouble  Yes  A little litigation  For E-Rock  Here's the thing  That was causing a problem  Because I looked up  On his Shred Nation board  And a couple other things  Why the finger quotes  For that?  Why the finger quotes?  Like he's not believing anything  Hashtag  Hashtag 
[00:39:00]  So  Hashtag what?  There were some things  Where it says  You know  It states his educational history  But when it comes to  His medical school  He was  He went to  Dartmouth Medical  But then left  And went to  University of Chicago  Pritzker  Pritzker School of Medicine  And it said  He completed his last two years  Of medical education  But  The thing is  Some of these people  Who I guess  Who are anti  Diets 
[00:39:30]  Or just people  Who are making money  Off diets  Were saying that  Nothing that he puts out  Other than he puts MD  There states that he completed  Holy shit  I don't think he's a doctor  In his own bio  Which says he completed  His medical education  Okay  Alright  And we have another clip  I get it  You don't like him  And you don't think he's a doctor  And then you said this  Yeah  We tried to get him  To finish the bit  To come in  And he couldn't come in  Because he handed you the money  He wanted it back  Yeah  So  No I lost the bet  Whatever it was  Even if I wanted the bet 
[00:40:00]  We were trying to get him back in  To finish this thing  Never came back in  Never called  Like nothing happened  And then  It was like what  2010 finally  When we got him back  On the show  Right  And he comes in  Walking with an attitude  Like there was a fucking problem  Well yeah  It's like you're the asshole  Who started this whole thing  And you don't come by  To finish it  And then he's like  Where's my money  Where's my  Let's go fuck yourself  Whoa  With that  We got Dr. Ian Smith next  And E-Rock's gonna 
[00:40:30]  Confront him a little bit  Oh yeah  Alright  Damn  Alright  Let's get Dr. Ian Smith  In here  He gave us like  Three minutes  To shove some food  Down our  Throats  Yeah  Dr. Ian Smith  Has a new book out  Called Super Shred  Hey  How you been man  Hey  It's been a while brother  Jeez  How are you man

[00:42:30]  Right  And so they burn it actually  So it goes into a lab  And they burn it  And they get all these recordings  Of what's in there  And what the calories are  No kidding  I always wondered how that  Was done  And how accurate it actually is  If you took a plate of food  Like a Big Mac and fries  Right  The way they get the numbers  Is they take it  They put it in this thing  They burn it  And they measure  You know  Calories or heat  Right  Right  So they measure  How much heat is produced  And that's how many calories  Is in there  And how do they figure out  The grams of fat  How do they figure out  The grams of fat  No no no  They actually have a dipstick 
[00:43:00]  Where they can actually  Look at the percentage  So they can  There's a chemical analysis  That's amazing to me  How's the popcorn Jimmy  I'm really good  I just feel like popcorn's  Not healthy  I haven't had popcorn  No  Are you kidding  Popcorn's one of the most  I swear to you  You know me  It's one of the most  Healthiest things  Not when you go to a movie theater  Hello  Yeah  You put a pound of butter  With that salt in the butter  You put a pound of butter  Anything  I don't like butter on my popcorn  Never did  Pop  Oh popcorn is a whole grain  Right  It's a whole grain  It's one of the  Healthiest things there is

My smoothie  Yeah  Hour and a half  Two hours you go on it  I'm telling you  This is the banana oatmeal breakfast  That I was talking about  Page 200  Page 200  You swiped some of mine  Except you threw some berries in there  Which I didn't think of  Oh shit 
[00:51:00]  So don't steal my idea  I mean I'm going to make that next week  I'm on Fox and Friends  I'm going to make that  This is one of my favorites  The Boston Green Monster  On page 185  Okay  It's my tip off to Boston  Chopped whiskey  Cucumbers  Bunch of drunks  Some Sam Adams beer  I've got a little Sam Adams up in there  I've got the Sam Adams  Put some Sam Adams in there  Kale is rough brother 
[00:51:30]  Let me tell you something  I know it's a great thing to eat  You will never  But kale is rough  I do a vegetable smoothie every afternoon too  And it's kale, spinach, carrots, and beets  But how do you taste it?  You can't taste it in here  Let me see what you're doing with your kale  Yeah  I put a little  You got to put a little sugar in there  It's okay  You know  Apple  You don't eat apples  But something sweet  Do something sweet  Sure  Ginger  You'll never taste it  Lemon juice  You'll never taste it  I swear you'll never taste the kale  I would never put sugar in my smoothies  Ever  You put a little honey in it 
[00:52:00]  A little agave  A little honey  Okay  Honey  Honey  So  But anyway  So these guys on Twitter  So this is what happened  I was on Twitter  By the way  You can tweet me at Dr. Ian Smith  I-A-N Smith  Dr. Ian Smith  And these people said  Hey, we want to lose weight in three days  I said  Can we really do this?  So I started tweeting out  A little diet plan  Right  For three days?  For three days  Okay  People are losing three pounds in three days  I didn't really have a diet  I mean  I was just kind of saying  Okay  Today we're going to do blah, blah, blah  So it's in like five tweets that day 
[00:52:30]  Next day  So they're like  Okay  We lost two pounds in three days  What's next?  I said to my guys  Listen  I don't have anything next  Right  So I kept going, going, going, going, going  And finally it became the plan  It became Shred  That's what Shred was  Shred really started as a  You know  Get more people on Twitter kind of thing  Right  And then people started losing crazy weight  So Shred was six weeks  Four inches  Two sizes  That was last year  And people would love the program  But then people like this lady  Beverly Simon  From Maryland  Lost a hundred pounds 
[00:53:00]  On Shred  Okay  I wish I had a picture to show you guys  But then she was like  I'm at a plateau  How do I break through the plateau?  How do you break through?  I mean  You ever hit a plateau  When you're  Yeah  What I just do is  They started training me  A little bit different  To build muscle  Which is  Let's be honest  A lot more work is needed  They said that will burn the fat  Is building certain muscle  And my eating is actually pretty decent  It's not amazing  But  But it's decent  It's just getting rid of  You know  It's like 40 something years  Of just utter shite  Neglect  Oh just neglect  And bluff 
[00:53:30]  Yeah  So now I'm trying to  I'm trying to build  My legs are really good  As everyone knows  It's common knowledge  Amazing calves  We all know it  You ever look back  At your old pictures?  That's all I do  Is tweet them  All I do is tweet them  Like any girl  That won't sleep with me now  I'm like  It could have been worse  Yeah  I was terrible  I was terrible  Look at some of those pictures  I didn't even realize  I know  It really is weird  Because you don't realize  How big Jimmy was  At that point  Because I would make fun of myself  I think  And I would mock myself  People didn't realize  What a pig-o I really was  I guess because I addressed it 
[00:54:00]  But people were like  I didn't realize you were that fat  Right  It was awful  E-Rock still has a problem with you  Oh right right  After all these years  After all these years  He still has a problem with you  Where's E-Rock?

[00:57:30]  Right  I can say Cutler sucks from the Bears  Why they resign him  Eli Manik needs to get an arm  I mean I can do all this kind of stuff here  Because it's me  It's a different hang  It's a different hang  I'm hanging out with my guys  Like in the locker room  Or whatever  You can let your  Oh well  I don't have any  It's gone  Thanks to age  But here's the deal  Thanks to age  Here's the deal  E-Rock  You know what  I hear what you're saying  I'm still an MD  I'm sensitive to you  Well E-Rock doesn't think you're an MD  Well E-Rock has his doubts there too  Oh geez  Now you've insulted Dr. Ian Smith 
[00:58:00]  We go to that level  Apparently  He looked up all sorts of stuff  He's convinced you're not an MD  Oh I'm not  Yeah  I bought it in the Bahamas  Your certificate is somewhere with Obama's birth certificate  That's right  That's right  It's a conspiracy  Yeah I'm in good company  Alright here's my challenge to you D-Rock  You ready for this  Sure  Simple questions  Because this is how I work with  I'm going to give you the sensitive Dr. Ian  Okay  E-Rock 
[00:58:30]  E-Rock do you acknowledge that you need to make some improvements  Yes  Would you be interested in changing your life  Yes  You just nod at your head like  Uh yes  Are you in  I'm in  But if it means doing super shred  That I don't know if I'm fully committing to do  But that's how you do it  But that's how you do it  There's no easy way to do it  But the sacrifices if you want to change your life  Yes  It's work  It takes some work  You thought you're going to have to suck your thumb  And hold your rifle while we all do push ups 
[00:59:00]  Dr. Ian holds up a jelly donut  Come and get it  Okay  Why  E-Rock  I have 65 year old women  Wow  Who lost weight on super shred  They don't have a trainer  They're not young like you  They don't have access to gyms  They don't have the money  Why would you not want to change your life  I do want to change my life  My problem with this diet  And with fat smash  Is that it was good for the time that you were on  And I read the parts about stage 3 and maintaining and what have you 
[00:59:30]  It comes off like an excuse  But in reality  It's not  You married now?  Possible  Yeah  Oh congratulations  It's not possible  Oh I thought you were going to take another shot  Alright  I saw your wedding gift  I said congratulations  Did you get me a wedding gift?  I found it not possible to maintain  And I even looked at your other book about that four day diet  Yep  And you had one other book  I'm forgetting the title  I went through all that as well 
[01:00:00]  And doing the diet and maintaining it is fine  While you're doing that portion of the diet  The lifestyle change to keep that going  Isn't very realistic for me  And I don't think it's very realistic for a lot of people  Did you exercise?  Yeah  Okay  Okay, okay  Hold on  Hold on  He's a lot  Man can have his opinion  Yeah but he doesn't even drink water  That is true  He doesn't even drink water  Cancer juice  Yeah you put pudding in your water  Alright  Tell him what you drank and don't lie 
[01:00:30]  Before you come  Recently  I know recently you're trying better  But before recently  Be honest  Tell him what you drank  And let him add up the calories  And then you're going to hear how it is reasonable  This wasn't a calorie issue  This was other shit  I used to drink a lot of soda  A lot of diet soda  So I know the aspartame and everything else isn't good for you  You drank pretty good  I also drink a lot of  Iced tea  A lot of iced tea and a lot of hot tea  Hey this is great iced tea  You sound like all these guys 
[01:01:00]  Who have an excuse  Seriously  You want a maintenance plan  I got a maintenance plan for you  That was your issue  I got a maintenance plan  Let's get 20 pounds off you  And I'll put you on maintenance  Okay  That's sustainable  Okay  You can have pizza  Lasagna  Oh that sounds good  You okay with that?  Yeah  As a smoothie  No  Sorry Jim's making it about himself 
[01:01:30]  Oh  Well he once did have a steak  Mashed potato  Steak martini  Steak mashed potato martini  Steak and mashed potato martini  Are you okay with that?  Losing 20 pounds  In four weeks  Hold on  But maintaining it  That's just the first part of it  The maintaining is where I have the big problem  But I'm telling you  I'm going to help you maintain it  With regular food  Are you okay with that?  I could be okay with that  Oh my god  What a non-commitment  This is what you hear all the time  It's a non-commitment  If I made some kind of sacrifice 
[01:02:00]  You gotta do  It's about sacrifice  It's about work  It's not like suffering  It's not suffering  But there are some sacrifices  I could say to him  Every meal's gotta be a salad  Am I saying that?  Right, right, right  I'm saying  You said it's real food  That you  You know  You just gotta stick to it  It's an addict in denial  And I'm not even shit on it  It's like that  But that's  It's kind of  It's food's an addiction  The hardest of all  And it's like  You try to protect that  Addictive behavior  It's fucking hard  Okay, fine  Fair enough 
[01:02:30]  But it's also not being used  As an excuse  I'm not saying  No, this is a complete excuse  No, it's not  You're making excuses  I wasn't asking for his help  If I was asking for his help  And then going to do this  Hold on  When this whole thing started  I was not asking for his help  If I was going to  Say what I said  And I was asking for his help  That's making an excuse  I'm well aware of it  And I know you hear that too  People are aware of it  And I know what you have to do  To change all that  I just don't do it  But Iraq, here's the point  You just came and lambasted me 
[01:03:00]  And said  I see you on all these shows  And you're nice  Not a doctor  Not a doctor  So I'm coming to you  Shyster  Shyster  All these things  I'm peddling wear  Piece of shit  Right  So I'm coming to you  As a physician  As a Harvard graduate  Harvard graduate  Wow  I'm coming to you  Fucking Harvard  And I'm saying to you  That I'm reaching out  I want to help you  Okay  Okay  Will you accept my help?  I'm being nice and warm  And sensitive to you  And I will call you  That is the face of non-commitment 
[01:03:30]  Will you accept my help?  You don't have to call me  Oh  Don't try to be tough  It'll be nice to get a call  From Dr. Smith  Iraq, what's this about?  And what are you doing now?  Because you are trying to  Lose weight on your own  Without a program  What are you doing differently?  What are you doing differently?  I've cut out a lot of stuff  Like  Over  This doesn't sound like  A big accomplishment  But for me it is  I'm over two weeks  Without soda at all  That's big  That's good  That's called an NSV  By the way  A non-scale victory  Okay  Okay, good  Alright, so there's that  I'm treating you like 
[01:04:00]  I do the guys on the shows  That's  Okay  Of course  So  Because he's so zone  He's so combative  So combative  I know  Iraq was very hurt  That you didn't  You didn't give him  The love that he needed  When he was going  Through a tough time  That's all  A lot of  Some of my favorite foods  I haven't had in a long time  French fries  Bacon  Those kind of things  It's been many months  Since I've had those  So step by step  I've been eliminating things  And trying to replace  Iraq feels like 
[01:04:30]  During the toughest times  In his life  You weren't there  I wasn't there  Like footprints  It's footprints in the granite  With him  Iraq  Iraq  Listen  Iraq  This is what I want to give you  From my house to yours  Iraq  Okay  Because that's a motivator  Because kids are a motivator  Kids are a motivator  I got two kids  Okay  Listen  Here's the deal  Iraq  I would like to help you  Lose up to 20 pounds

[01:08:00]  But I didn't want to lose the weight  Because you started making it  I've seen the last 10 years of this show  It's all humiliating bits  But if you lose the weight  People will be happy for you  Why are you shaking?  You know  Why are you shaking?  Hungry  You said this to me on Monday too  Well  He noticed it too  So  It's probably caffeine  I thought you cut out a lot of that  You just said you cut out  I cut out a lot of soda  But I didn't cut out  I said I'm still on iced tea  Regular tea  Hey  Great iced tea 
[01:08:30]  Wow  Opie said he's going to add  Another 500  I'll match 500  If you pull out  No problem  And I'll tell you what  I'll watch Opie give 500  Absolutely  And I'll applaud and narrate  The entire thing  We're all involved  Rowan wants in on this by the way  Rowan wants to challenge E-Rock  I heard  Or was that bullshit  Or someone set me up  Challenge  I love a good challenge  What?  I can do easily  He said easily  Easily  Now that's the mindset you need  We've seen Rowan drop weight  He was doing very good for a while 
[01:09:00]  His problem  My foodie friends  Foodie friends  But the smoothies  Going to the juice generation  We used to go to all the time  Was killing him  He just doesn't make that  Type of money  Where he can afford  Going to a juice place  Speaking of fruit  So what do you say to those people  And then Ian  The people that buy  Their fruits and vegetables  You know  That's very expensive  It can be expensive  But you know what  You  Well  It can be  Yeah you're right  It can be  But you don't need to buy  Organic fruits all the time  Right  You know  You really don't  That's kind of a lot 
[01:09:30]  The organic stuff is a lot of hype  But if you have the money  You want to do it fine  But you can do it without it  We have a scale  Uh oh  Okay  So Roland  Jeez Roland  You've never gotten involved in this  Ian  Now he dropped  How much did you drop?  80 pounds  He dropped 80  Wow  And then he  Proceeded to gain most of it back  Unfortunately  Cronuts and steaks  Oh cronuts  Jesus Christ  You're ready to lose weight again?  Yeah  Ready to go  Step on  I ain't giving no money  It's going to be a lot  If you hear it crying  It's because of the  Oh it's alright

Ian Smith is making a face like wow  Are you ready for this?  Uh huh  120  Close 
[01:10:30]  Close  Times three  Wow  336 pounds  Holy shit  That's not healthy  Rolling  What the hell  That's not healthy  You can always go close  Trap and Models  Dude  You've got defensive linemen  Who don't weigh 330  Really?  Because they run really fast  He carries his weight  Well or something  He's very dense  Hold on for a second  I see something brewing here  But  Could we do a competition?  Would you guys be fine with that?  Oh that would be great 
[01:11:00]  I'll go all balls in  Start the day  Okay here's the deal  Balls in  South in  See but I know  Roland will do this  No problem  Roland will kill it  Okay here's the thing  He will kill it  This is  Back to my celebrity fit club days  Here's how it's going to work  Here's how it's going to work  Four weeks  Whoever loses  The biggest percentage  Because obviously  Roland has a lot more to lose  Than E-Rock  Obviously  Yeah yeah  He's almost 400  Oh good  You want to do a percentage  Fair  It's percentage of body weight  Right percentage of weight 
[01:11:30]  What's E-Rock's weight?  E-Rock  Come on  E-Rock  So Roland's 336 pounds  Get on that  I haven't talked about shit yet though  That's wrong  It doesn't matter  It's the same  You can use the same scale  Hold on  You got your picture  Let me take mine  That's good  One thing she had me 330 boys  Okay  So E-Rock is 247.8  That's wrong  Because that's not going to be this morning  Okay so you think the scale is  The scale is busted 
[01:12:00]  It doesn't matter  We're going to weigh  It's the same scale  It's all relative  It's all relative  What do you weigh at home?  It's like 237  237?  What do you got 10 pounds of clothes on?  Wait you want me to see  I'll jump on it  Because I weighed myself yesterday  So you know how accurate the scale is  Good  Good  We have a constant  I think I'll just tap it  Set  This doesn't go  Ah  Okay  By the way  Back to you and Smith  Eric was 214  When we did this  How many years ago?  Four years ago?  Oh god that's nice  Say it again 
[01:12:30]  Say it again  Eric  Eric was 214  In 2007  And now he's 240  The first thing I noticed  When I saw him  Was like his face  Oh no  It's saying 155.8  And I was 148 something yesterday  So that scale is worth  Probably off by a couple  Yeah but I have clothes on  I was totally nude yesterday  Oh  Do tell  This is probably  Five pounds or six pounds  I'll have clothes on  Okay  But clothes are about  Four or five pounds  Right  It doesn't matter what it says  The point is  That's the starting point 
[01:13:00]  It's going to be the same scale we use  Same place  We're the same clothes  Let's take a picture  Yeah but someone is now  Going to adjust the scale  And then they're going to be  Way ahead of the game  Stand together so we can  Take a picture of you guys  But it's a competition  Against each other  Ready  One  Two  True  Good  Now hold on  Eric does one in on this  By the way  Oh he wants  No part of this  Right  No part of this  I think Iraq's worried  That he won't be able to do it  Yeah  Look at Eric's face  As he points  Iraq's disgusted 
[01:13:30]  In the book  He's pointing at the book  You've seen this shit though  Right  A million times  Are you kidding  I do this in my sleep  Like these guys  Alright  I break these guys down  They're just  No Roland will do it  So  I've seen Roland do it  Okay so four weeks guys  Right  And when Roland gets motivated  Forget it  Four weeks  A thousand bucks  Yeah  Five from me  Five from Oak  What  I'm putting you in Oak  I'll give Iraq the 500  Because I know he ain't doing it  You had your best 
[01:14:00]  Of course I am  I'm not that generous  Okay so  What happened  Oh your mic  Sam needs a mic  Oh  Sorry  So the 500 that you just gave Eric  Yes  If Roland wins this  That money goes to Roland  Correct  Is that fair  That's fair  Okay  And then Opie gives me 500  Yes  Whoa  It's true  The match  So now I'm out 500  No matter what  Yes  Yeah no matter what  How did that happen  Well you get married

[01:17:30]  See that's changed my life  Thanks  Oh yeah  There you go  See  Yeah Roland is ready to fucking do it  That's a guy who's ready  I need some pussy boys  Wow wait  Wow  Wow  I thought you could take the 500 and use it for him  Yeah  Ladies and gentlemen  Roland just had what we call a psychotic break  Yeah  Jesus like wow  Where'd that come from  Alright guys 
[01:18:00]  Always a pleasure  Dr. Ian Smith  Take it easy  Alright we'll be back  Once again I want to thank Dr. Ian Smith for stopping in  Oh yeah  That was fun  Looking through the book  There's some good things in Super Shred  Oh  Very cool  And Eric's back in studio  Because he's got some intel on Roland  Already they're snooping around on each other  There's a competition between you and Roland right now 
[01:18:30]  Well  Roland and I were discussing the event that's taking place here  And Roland decided that he's going to have one less celebratory breakfast before kicking into the Super Shred  Into the weight loss challenge  Right  It doesn't make sense though because you've already weighed in  Right  It's not like he can celebrate and then weigh himself  You're on the clock  Yeah  Like right now you should be blending up a smoothie somewhere  Right  It's already  But Roland is celebrating  Roland is celebrating  The fact that he's  Has entered into a weight loss competition 
[01:19:00]  It doesn't make sense  That's why Roland and I love these guys  I think pancakes and bacon are involved  Wow  So he's treating himself to one last  Roland are you treating yourself to one last breakfast?  No I have an omelet not pancakes  I don't like the pancakes here  No  Bacon  No  What do you mean the pancakes here?  And uh toasties  It's like ugh  Oh I thought Sirius XM had pancakes  Oh yeah  If it did it probably tastes like shit  Because the holiday food tastes like shit  Eric's saying you're having one big giant breakfast to celebrate 
[01:19:30]  He can say what he wants  But I'm going to lose more weight than him  Whoa  There it is  Talking some smack  I have no doubt  Whoa  I'm team Roland on this one  Just because I've seen what Roland could do  When he puts his mind down  I'm going to try to hit 40  I'm going to try to double it  In four weeks?  That might be tough  Yeah you don't want to kill yourself man  You want to do it  Because you want it to progress after that  20 pounds is a joke for him though  I'm telling you  He's going to kill  A lot of you  Yes  I saw it  I saw it happen  We were going to the juice place every day 
[01:20:00]  Yep  So I'm going to focus in  Take the money  And then give it to the scum landlords  For the what?  Landlords  The scum landlords  I think it's  Well he's got to find a new place  If anyone has a cool place for Roland to live  He'd appreciate it  Yeah  What are you looking these days?  Williamsburg  And back to Long Island City  Back to Long Island City again  Williamsburg  I know it's a hot area  But it's a pain they have to get to Manhattan  Yeah but around here  It's like  One bedroom starts at like 38 to 4  4,000 
[01:20:30]  A month  Yeah when people hear that  Around the country  They can't believe it  That's what people pay for one lousy room  Historia  I go  Oh it's Queens  Studio is $29.50  I'm like  Historia  Historia  Historia  From Historia  Fucking pig  Even Bed-Stuy is $22.50  Yeah  That's unbelievable  For one bedroom?  No  For a studio  No  Yeah Bed-Stuy  Wow  Bed-Stuy is still a rough area 
[01:21:00]  It's very scary  I went there  Oh you went there just to check it out  I went out  Are the hipsters trying to turn that around?  There was no hipsters  I just yelled  Something else with errs  Someone yelled  Hey sugar  Come here  And I was like  Oh  My ass went back to the subway and ran  Wow  If they called you sugar  You'd probably be loved in that neighborhood  My ass would be loved  Oh man  Delicious bear  I was scared  Yeah I bet  Alright well  Game on for you two 
[01:21:30]  Game on  What are the immediate plans?  Like dinner tonight  Let's say  Dinner tonight  I'm just going to  Read the book  Do the salad  He said  It's all in the book  He said  Can I go over the book  And start everything tomorrow  Iraq  Is this going to be a problem for you?  Does your wife  Mind if you have to  Change things around?  I'm sure she's jumping up and down  Really?  Excited about this  Does um  Has she hinted  I'm sorry  Has she hinted  You should lose weight?  Many times  How does she say it? 
[01:22:00]  Put that down  You need to lose weight  Does she cook?  She does yes  Yeah  But now is she going to have to  Are you going to be like  Oh can you blend me up this  And do that  Or you got to do it yourself?  I got to do it myself  Oh man  But now if she cooks something  You could eat that  Much easier  Than if you had  And make it yourself  See I don't  I don't see Iraq  Having that type of willpower  I think if  I think if the Mrs. Rock  Cooks something  And it's sitting there  All delicious  And then Iraq's got to 
[01:22:30]  Yeah  Make something  I think it'll just be like  It's going to take a ladle to it  Let me just get some lasagna here  Oh one ladle  Yeah one ladle can't hurt  Can't hurt me  She did just make banana bread  Oh  That's some good stuff right there  And we are hitting Super Bowl Sunday  Which is  Oh the Super Bowl  Right  Which is the Thanksgiving  For my people  Yeah but there's always going to be an event  You know what I mean  It's hard  But there's always going to be  If it's not Super Bowl Sunday  It's going to be  Groundhog Day  Yeah there's always something 
[01:23:00]  What Super Bowl is that  To me  The holiday's Christmas  Thanksgiving okay  You're going to have to lose  The Cronaut guy's number  You know that  No you're not enough Cronauts  You've got to leak that number  For a little bit  Well he has something for me  For Monday  So  What does he have for your Monday  He has a new dessert sale  Oh you don't need it  No I'll pass it out to other people  Yeah  And just like the box  That's why you're losing the weight  Because you want to  Roland I'm on your team for this  I know  Now I'll lose it  Alright  I want to be on E-Rock's team  But I saw the body language 
[01:23:30]  He has no desire to work with Dr. Ian Smith  So don't forget your cashes though  Alright  That's good shit right there  That was fun  I'm totally into this  That was alright  Alright  Speaking of the Superbowl  Did you guys see the banned commercial?  I did not  Oh the gun one?  This is a brilliant market  This is about a while ago  A while ago yeah  With the guy talking about it?  Nah I haven't heard him talk about it  There's a guy talking about it too as well 
[01:24:00]  And explaining the hypocrisy  Of the whole fucking thing  Yeah  It's a brilliant marketing strategy though  To put a commercial out there  Maybe it's banned from the Superbowl  Because they just don't have  You know  Slots for every commercial  That people are offering  Well don't they also  So then you jump on YouTube  And say  Oh man they banned my commercial  And boom  Everyone's going to go check it out  There's a policy on no firearm ads  Or something  So they probably  They just don't do that  Well  Is this the one  Sam with the guy  Explained  The one I saw  Is about three and a half minutes long 
[01:24:30]  Okay  This is not it  That's not it?  Oh boy  It's me and Travis  Travis where did you see it earlier  When we were looking for it?  I googled  YouTube?  Was it on the YouTube?  No  Let's see  Yeah it's that one  Right there  Alright here we go  The following has been banned by  The NFL  Guy driving home  It's been a long road getting here  And a lot has changed 
[01:25:00]  Since I got back  Nice  Now this is the center of my world  Nice neighborhood  Nice house  He was in the army  Oh  Marine strong  Yep  And my family's safety  Is my highest priority  Yeah  Nice hot wife  Baby monitor  Alright  I am responsible for their protection  Alright 
[01:25:30]  Nice tits  Yeah  Oh no that's the baby  And no one has the right to tell me how to defend them  Exactly  So I've chosen the most effective tool for the job  Daniel Defense  Defending your nation  Defending your home  Nice  Little gut ad  Fucking arm up  You smell that  Smells like  Smells like 
[01:26:00]  Hypocrisy  So let me get this straight  I can watch a bunch of muscle bound human wrecking balls collide with each other at close to terminal velocity  Flirting with becoming a project plegic with every snap of the football simply for our entertainment  Watch a commercial about shitting  I mean shipping my pants  Watch Bar Raffaele suck face from Michael Moore's immaculately conceived love child  Let's not forget the striptease twerk fest that was and usually is the halftime show  But there's just something about a commercial where a man who has served this country with his life 
[01:26:30]  Talks about protecting his family that just goes too far  You do realize that's like teaching a 15 year old how to cook meth, pimp prostitutes and gamble  But then beat him for picking his nose  This type of selective censorship is really bordering on a line of social lunacy  Where the idea of self-protection is considered offensive  But I can watch Beyonce happily I might add hump the stage during the halftime show  And don't even bother coming at me with the  We don't want to politicize football  When Mayor Bloomberg is allowed a commercial where he insidiously advocates to taking away of a constitutional right 
[01:27:00]  Along with Bob Costas mouth-breathing his way through an anti-gun soliloquy during Sunday night football  I see more beer commercials during the Super Bowl than I see football  But don't get me wrong, I love beer, especially IPAs  And if some company wants to give me $3 million, I'll name a specific brand  But let's not act like alcohol doesn't account for more deaths than guns do  But I don't see the NFL or the powers that be banning beer commercials  I'd love to hear someone try to explain convincingly  To a football player who gets paid millions of dollars to play arguably the most popular sport in America 
[01:27:30]  On national television  Probably drives around in a car that costs more than the medium annual salaries of most of his fans  Lives in a house the size of the arenas he plays in  And try to tell him it's not a good idea to have a gun for protection  All because a couple jackasses do something bad with a gun and the NFL thinks it has a gun problem  But won't address the number of players with DUIs and drinking problems  Or better yet, ban alcohol commercials from football games  I like football, I love beer  I'll watch Beyonce hump the stage until I'm blue in the face 
[01:28:00]  But I have to call a spade a spade  And banning a commercial that espouses the very foundation this country was founded on  Is hypocritical as fuck  Oh, that's by the NFL  That's good  That's very good  Yes, he makes a great point  Yeah, that's really nice  Who is that guy?  Okay, not really  I don't even know  I've seen his stuff before, yeah  YouTuber  Oh, okay  I've seen some of his other stuff before  He's very  Well, that was brilliant  Pro-Second Amendment  Put that together nicely  Very concise  Yeah  That is hypocrisy 
[01:28:30]  Total hypocrisy  And why is that?  That like the idea of defending yourself and your family  With one of the best tools for that job  Is looked upon like you're some kind of a lunatic  It's the best tool for the job of protecting your family  When, you know, the old push comes to shove  There are plenty of precautions you can take  Alarm systems  You know, living in the right neighborhood 
[01:29:00]  Cameras, things like that  Those are precautions  But when it really happens  And you need to protect your family  Wouldn't you want the best possible tool for the job?  Which is some type of firearm  But it's looked upon like  Now you're a mental patient  If you want to exercise your Second Amendment  And decide what's best for you and your family  In protecting you and them  Right  Terrible 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, he's right  That was very good  Yeah  Put together very, very well  A lot of people send me his stuff  Anthony, check this out  I bet you wouldn't expect it  Yeah, I get it  He's black  Right  Right  You wish a white guy was doing that?  Yeah, there are plenty of white guys doing that  I kind of like when I see  Something that breaks the old mold  Breaks the old stereotype  Yeah, but then you've got to replace the mold  No, Chip, you don't  Like with you 
[01:30:00]  When you were born  They broke that mold, right?  It melted in hell  He tries to sound cool  And it just doesn't work  It melted in hell  Like we're supposed to go  Wow, Chip, that was fucking cool  That's dangerous  You're dangerous  You don't think that's cool?  No  You're dangerous  Chip's a douche  The Cubs' new mascot 
[01:30:30]  Travis got this story  Travis, if you will  What happened here?  This is terrific  The Cubs have a new mascot  Yes  Because after 138 years  You need a mascot  Right  Right  They never had a mascot?  Nope  So his name's Clark  Aw, Clark the little cub  Clark  I love him  He's a little bear cub  Right  Yeah  Yeah, he certainly is  The fans hate him  The fans always hate  I hate mascots  Of course they should  Didn't Boston come up  With the green monster thing?  Is that still happening?  Do they still have the green monster?  I remember when that was introduced 
[01:31:00]  And man, Boston wanted to set him on fire  I would say they do  Fucking hate that  They hated it  But every team, I guess, has to have a mascot  Why?  Because it's good for merch  Oh, is it?  It's great for merch  For kids, I guess  You go and get a little Clark cub for your kid  Ah, Clark the cub  He's adorable  Do the fans like him?  No  No  No, they hate him  Clark  He's like a little one holding a baseball  With his hat on backwards  Oh, look at Clark  That one's a little  Well, that one's a little different  That's why we're bringing up this story  I love it 
[01:31:30]  His dick and balls are hanging out  That's a different rendition of the cartoon bear  That was posted on Deadspin  Right  So then there was a news story about it  On some Comcast station  Oh, no  And Sam's got the clip  Yeah  Right  And they didn't really check what they were showing  Brilliant  Well, fun now  We turn to mascots  The Chicago Cubs  They introduced their new mascot  Their first ever mascot 
[01:32:00]  Clark the bear  Described as a young, friendly cub  Who can't wait to interact with the kids  He doesn't wear any pants  I think that is a gag photo  He also chooses to wear sneakers  But they have a mascot  Mascot problem of their own  Their mascot, Pierre the pelican  Is horrifying  He looks like a deranged, bloodthirsty clown  That feeds on children  Pierre the pelican  Pretty bad 
[01:32:30]  But which one was the worst?  The name I have to start with the same letter as the  That one was an artist's depiction  First of all  I don't know what to say about a bear  Did Yogi bear wear pants?  I'm not sure  Because I don't know if him and Boo-Boo wore pants  Yogi bear, I believe, wore a collar and tie  He was a classy bear  But still  This one's pretty  Crumpy  It's like a children's character  Yeah  You don't want to touch on the fact that the thing wasn't wearing pants  And it's dick and balls  It's animated little drawing  Dick and balls was hanging out 
[01:33:00]  They picked the wrong fucking still  That's funny  You think they did it on purpose?  You think whoever picked the picture was like  Yeah, I bet they did  Why? That's your job  Yeah, but it's like the same way the guy at Fox News  Was like throwing O&A clips in  To random spots  Like sometimes people just stop giving a fuck  Fuck yeah  Really?  Oh god  It's so crazy  That happened yesterday, which is nice  And then we got the Westboro Baptist troll guy  That likes to do the Ramon thing 
[01:33:30]  So he's got to be a fan of the show  Yeah, I would hope so  That's completely unique to Jim Norton  And this is the second one he's done  Did we find the first one?  I think the first one is in this video  And by the way, he was going after her for Sam  The bastard's son  He was talking about having sex outside of marriage  And getting pregnant  And she was not happy  Yeah, was this at the Golden Globes?  Why were they at the Golden Globes?  Because they're just assholes  Because there's fags  Because there's fags in Hollywood? 
[01:34:00]  Anywhere there are fags  You've got to get the church there  Oh, I see  They don't go in Bed-Style a lot  They don't go in a fucking Brownsville a lot  Not many fags  Oh, I think there's enough for them to win  Jesus  Probably enough for them, right?  Yeah  Sure, more than one is too many  That's a very good point, Jim Norton  They pick soft targets  Yeah  So this is the dude outside the Golden Globes  Can I hear this?  Please  With the remote thing  You're blocking my Walker in Hell side  Paul Walker had a charity 
[01:34:30]  What are your charities?  Your charity is getting out on these streets  Warning people  So how many people can eat your hate  If this is the only charity you do?  I'm not going to talk to you about what we do charitably  To help people  It's none of your stinking business  How many people  You know what?  Christ said  Don't let your right hand know what your left hand is doing  Is that how you're able to masturbate?  So shut the hell up about Paul Walker and his public alms  Are condoms a sin? 
[01:35:00]  Because you know your butt can't get pregnant, right?  Don't turn it to me now  Did the Jews kill Jesus?  Right, so as a Jew, I'm responsible for what the Jews did  Like create the polio vaccine or be Jesus  What if God was one of us  And you called him a fag?  So, I mean, that's just  Is it a foolish question to think that Jesus might be on the earth right now?  Well, he is  So how do you know you haven't called him a fag?  Well  The scripture says  That some of his people are as fags 
[01:35:30]  The Bible has the word fags in it  So you haven't read the Bible  The scripture said  The word fags was  It's an English word  England didn't exist  It also says you should have been set on fire for having sex before marriage  So I don't know what you're  It said  Didn't it say if a child of a preacher  If she had sex before marriage  Get set on fire?  That is in the Bible  You've never been set on fire  I mean, I don't know what your dad did  Maybe that's why your hair looks like that  Is it true that you guys were rejected from the Sochi Olympics  Because of what Fred was caught doing in that airport bathroom  With what turned out to be a cop? 
[01:36:00]  Is that true?  Terrific  I know you guys are going to protest A&E for Duck Dynasty  While you're there  Are you going to try it for sister wives?  Why are you doing this?  Why?  Because  I mean, really  What's going on up there?  Because it's the truth  I mean, this church specifically  Is there anything  Is this like a gay-friendly church?  I don't know what this church did specifically  I like their fag sin sign  With the universal symbol  Of someone bent over  Taking it up the ass  Have you been anywhere besides California?  Are threesomes okay in the marriage bed 
[01:36:30]  If only two of the people are people?  The power of Christ compels you  The power of me compels you  The power of me  This is Jesus  I forgive you  But my dad thinks you guys  Are a bunch of dickholes  When you got pregnant by a stranger  Were you relieved it wasn't your dad's?  I'm jiggling a little  I won't say anything  And I'll just give you a chance  And just say whatever the message is  Ramone, stop fucking your sister 
[01:37:00]  And get a job  If being transgender is a sin  Why do you dress like truckers?  That's funny shit, man  You understand that you're just bi, right?  I mean, that  You're assuming everyone has the choice  Between men and women  Because you have that choice  Because you're attracted to both  But most people like me  Are only attracted to one  Most of these people  Are only attracted to one, too  Well, once again  You're twisting my words  You said you had a desire  To kiss your male friend  That guy's really good  We gotta get him on the air 
[01:37:30]  That's funny  Let's try to get a note to him  Sure  He obviously knows of us  Takes balls to do that, right?  Yeah, you know  You get right up in someone's face like that  They're professionals, man  They're not gonna do a fucking thing  Yeah  But  Still takes balls  Yeah  Very good for that guy  I need a piece of fucking  Dental floss  Now you got some of that popcorn  Ah, it's the fucking popcorn  I can't chew  How was the popcorn?  Was it good?  It's amazing 
[01:38:00]  It's called Shred Pop  Jesus, I think Dr. J. Smith's worth a few bucks, huh?  Yeah  Oh, yeah  He's got a few bucks  He just peeled that 500 right off  For Iraq  Like it was nothing  Yeah  If you put 500 bucks in your pocket in the morning  And leave the house  You can't just, like, give it away  So  I think he's doing quite okay for himself  It's more from where that came  Mm-hmm 
[01:38:30]  Got the ice kill coming in  In about an hour  Yeah  How's this new movie look?  Ride Along  I haven't even seen a trailer for it with Kevin  We were supposed to go check it out  I saw the trailer  It does look funny  It does look good  Oh, the trailer actually did look good  Yeah, I know  It really does look good  Ride Along  Kevin Hart's becoming a fucking movie star, huh?  He was in the fucking  De Niro movie  The De Niro Stallone movie  And then the next poster down was this  On the fucking 10th Avenue  The Stallone De Niro movie 
[01:39:00]  That didn't do well, right?  I don't know  That came away, no?  No idea  The posters look creepy  Because it was so photoshopped  Oh, yeah, it was  Really?  Because they had to make their faces look a little younger  But they were old guys anyway  So why did they do that?  On the posters  How did it do?  Yeah, it didn't make any sense  It didn't make no sense  It did not do well at all  Oh, shit  $28,000 they made  $28,000  $28,000  That's not good  $28,000  $28,000 
[01:39:30]  That's not a lot of money  Especially because the production budget was $40 million  So it's like  No, I mean  Technically it'll be a success  And $28,000?  I don't think so  But that's  You know  It's like De Niro has just done  Stallone at least is doing the expendables  Which is making  Mom after mom  Fucking De Niro has just done  I mean  I mean  American Hustle  I know it was a cameo  That was a great cameo  Yeah  I know  But it was just more De Niro as a mobster  Like at least Pacino played Kevorkian  And fucking  Phil Spector 
[01:40:00]  But at least he's trying to do all these different things  And he's not doing complete cheese dick every time  Right  Look at De Niro's a great actor  What's he doing?  We get it  Well, we're gonna have to bring the papers  And we're gonna have to see what the other mobster  Right  We heard you  You're gonna get whacked  Yeah  Well, we'll see what he has to say  Right  Come on  Oh, no  Here he comes  On the arm  On the arm  But what is he supposed to do? 
[01:40:30]  Was he supposed to retire?  Because his body of work is ridiculous  I'll tell you what  What's supposed to happen to a guy like that?  Just be more selective  Like you're one of the guys  Right  Who can do whatever  He should have blown off some of those films  Yeah  Because he could do other films for the same fucking money  Right  Like uh  Or just wait it out  Maybe not retire  But just wait it out  Wait it out until you get a real good one  Although the one that he won for  Because some idiot told him he was funny  That's the problem  Yeah  Which he was  He can't promise  Bob, here's a script  And I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it  But it started with Meet the Parents 
[01:41:00]  He just grabs anything  But Meet the Parents  Yeah  You know  It showed his comedic side  And then someone said  You know, you're really funny  And then next thing you know  He's in a million  Was it that one or  Canalyze this?  Canalyze that?  In 82  Huh?  Yeah  The King of Comedy was in 82  King of Comedy  But that was a little more  That was a little dark  He was hilarious in that  It was absolutely  Yeah, but some people wouldn't find him hilarious in that  Because it was so dark  But you're right  Yeah, I guess he's done a lot of  Great psychic  Comedic roles  What's the one he just  The one in the awards  With Jennifer Lawrence recently  I hated it  Silver Linings  I didn't like it  I didn't like it 
[01:41:30]  I liked the movie  I didn't think his performance  Was anything special  At all  No, I hated it  Jeez  She's a good actress  But enough out of her already  Why?  She's up and coming still  She's on her way  What's wrong with her now?  She's a good actress  But I think she's a little overrated  Who?  She's Jennifer Lawrence  I think she's the next darling of Hollywood  She was great in American Hustle  She was good  But I didn't think she deserved to win  And she was great in Silverback  Playbook  Whatever the fun time was called  It's a different movie  Silver Linings 
[01:42:00]  What was it again?  Silver Linings  Silver Linings  Oh yeah  I thought she was  I think she was pretty good  Yeah  I agree  She's very good  And then she's in the Hunger Games  Playing a completely different person  So  She's got some range  Yeah, I just  I just  She's got a little range  After seeing what they just did  At the Golden Globes  I'm like  Oh, she's the one they have picked  For that spot  Well, who should have won that?  It's not even close  Who was up for that?  The girl in  Oh, right  You do have an answer to this  And I was on this Fox panel yesterday 
[01:42:30]  With Sherrod  We were talking about racism  It was a good chat  Kennedy actually has a show  And it's called The Independence  And we were talking about something about racism  At the end I was like  Yeah  And I mentioned this as  I thought being a racist decision  But not  And the black guy's like  Well, do you have evidence of that?  And it was like  I didn't make my point clearly  And I kind of regret saying that  Because I don't like to throw out that accusation  But I said it was not based on racial hatred  Because I didn't think it was  It's just  I think people get very comfortable  In how they see people  And there's a certain type of 
[01:43:00]  But I wasn't clarifying my point  But I kind of wish I didn't say that  Because I don't like to throw that accusation out improperly  Well, we got someone that wants to defend  Mr. De Niro  John of New York  Go ahead  Hey, good morning, guys  Hi, John  All right  You guys were saying  De Niro was only doing monster stuff  What about his older stuff?  I mean, like  Taxi Driver, Raging Bull  Those were  Did we ever  Were we  That's what we're talking about now  That's what we're saying  You're confused, sir  I was on the phone  So I didn't  His body of work is amazing, dude 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, well, I said  His body of work is  Absolutely  Bang the drums slowly  He's done some amazing movies  But literally  Well, lately it's been a little weird  A little weird  Well, you know, you're getting older  He doesn't have much range  And what else can he play  But the older monster, you know  But you just look at someone like Pacino  He's, you know  He's adapted  And taken some risks  And made some  Dude, Pacino has done  The same character each time  With a different ethnic name  Come on  No, he has not  I don't think so  Really? 
[01:44:00]  How about he played Roy Cullen  In Angels of America  He played an old gay man  Dying of AIDS  He plays Kevorkian  He plays Phil Spector  The guy has done a tremendous  I'm not saying he hasn't done  Shitty movies  But he's done a lot of  Variety in the last 15 years  He hasn't done as many  Shitty movies as De Niro  In recent years  Don't get me wrong  Pacino, great actor  He's done a lot of great roles  Yeah, but  I mean, putting down De Niro  It's just  Yeah, it's ludicrous  No, it's not ludicrous  Look at it  Look at the movies  He's making these days  They stink  Give me De Niro's  IMBD page 
[01:44:30]  He's better than these movies, dude  That's the point I'm making  I think De Niro  IMDB  Should sink himself into a real role  His recent stuff  You're 100% correct  He's much better than what he's doing  But at the same time  You can't really expect much out of the guy  Silver Wedding's playbook  Came out in 2012  He's been in something called  The Big Wedding  The Family  Killing Season  Las Vegas  American Hustle  Grudge Match 
[01:45:00]  What else he's got coming out  This is our point  He's taken every movie they offer him  He's doing like two or three movies a year  I mean, the guy is an amazing fucking workaholic  And he's probably making a shitload of money  How about you just fucking  Not open every script  And send him back  Nah, not that one  What was The Family about again?  I auditioned for that  Mob one  That's another movie that came to win, right?  I auditioned as a mobster in that one  I'm not a good mobster  How do you do?  Not particularly well  No  Right in front of Luke Bassan 
[01:45:30]  I give a fuck  Oh, really?  Yeah, not a good audition  I think this was the one that Mike Buschetti had a cameo in  Yeah, it is  And my scene would have been fucking pointing a gun at fucking Michelle Pfeiffer  Oh, Michelle Pfeiffer  Yeah, and De Niro would have been in that scene too, I think  Bobby!  That movie didn't do anything, right?  No, it did not  It was not heralded as great  No  All right  Well, we love him, John  We just think he should make better choices  Now that he's an older gentleman  That's true 
[01:46:00]  You guys got a point  All right, have a great day  All right, bye  All right, man  Because look at Christopher Walken  Who I know is not the star De Niro is as far as name draw  And he does a lot of walking and everything  But it's like he still does these really cool, interesting, weird things  That are fun to watch  And it's like with De Niro  It's like, what are you fucking doing, dude?  You're one of the greats  Pacino's best movie was Any Given Sunday  Yeah, he's done some clunkers, I'm sure  Hey, we missed...  Someone couldn't wait any longer  They wanted to say that E-Rock got owned by Dr. Ian Smith  Yeah, he did  He got owned 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, he got owned  He came in  He can't play in that world  No way  Dr. Ian Smith can handle himself  He came in to confront Ian Smith  Right  And what Ian did was basically bring him right back to the beginning of when we were at K-Rock  Yeah, yeah, that was...  Like six or seven years ago  The thing that bothered E-Rock  Yes  The most, he's now doing again  Dr. Ian Smith did the exact same thing to him again  It's the same scenario  He actually took the money  Look what I did to you again  It's the same scenario, except this one is going to be more humiliating 
[01:47:00]  Because now he's competing with a co-worker  Yeah  Do you understand that?  Can we slow that down?  He has all these problems with Dr. Ian Smith  Right  Because of the challenge  The initial challenge many years ago  Yeah  And instead of confronting him  He's now doing that exact same thing that bothered the fuck out of him  Except worse  I'll tell you why he's doing it though  Two reasons  One, the doctor thing was immediately shut down  Because apparently he is a fucking MD  He graduated from fucking Harvard  And he's on the President's Council 
[01:47:30]  Yeah  It's just  It's a terrible argument  And the real gut reason of what bothered E-Rock  Was that he felt abandoned by Dr. Ian Smith  Yes, that came out  And E-Rock is a very sensitive boy  He is a very sensitive boy  And that's what it was all  And then Ian's like  Okay, I'll talk to you like this  That came out  Oh, you know  Yeah, you see you on these shows  And you call this guy and help this guy  Oh, I see  You didn't get enough attention  Ian's smart  And you're just picking up on any argument  Oh, yeah  E-Rock, instead of coming in and being like 
[01:48:00]  You're a dickhead  Uh-huh  You treated me like an asshole  Oh, here comes E-Rock  Look at the swagger  Oh, now he's marching to the wall  Look, he's moving  Who's he mad at, you think?  I don't know  Yeah, E-Rock  Eric  He didn't get a doctorate from Harvard  Oh, shit  I'm not saying he's a doctorate from Harvard  I'm saying he's a doctorate  And he graduated from Harvard  He can trick Obama, but he can't trick E-Rock  He didn't admit to being a doctor  He did  No  He's an MD  He's of his own accord  Oh  What happened?  Harvard  He got a BA  And a master's in science education 
[01:48:30]  I didn't say he got a doctorate  You misdustrated me  I said he's a doctorate  And he graduated from Harvard  Uh-huh  That is what Jim said  Yeah  Went to Dartmouth Medical School  If you're downplaying the fact that he got a BA at Harvard  That's  I got a BA from Geneseo  Yep  He wouldn't be putting MD on his fucking team  That's pretty impressive  Who fakes being a doctor  But legitimately graduated from Harvard?  And he's on the President's Council  Like, it's not like this guy is just some fucking fly-by-night douche  He puts MD  Don't you think some competitor  If he was lying  And he's the number one bestseller 
[01:49:00]  Would have come out and said  Excuse me  This guy's not a doctor  Or somebody who works for the President  To protect him from hiring fake doctors  There's a difference between putting D  R in front of your name  And MD after your name  There is, right?  As far as being a doctor  Yeah  I mean, Dr. William H. Cosby  Junior  Has an honorary doctorate  But, um  This is, this is  Yeah  Might be the same thing  Oh, no  But if you put MD at the end  That means medical doctor  That's for real  You can't just put medical doctor 
[01:49:30]  Yeah  You can't put a medical doctor  On the fucking front page  On the company  Because, again  He'd be called out  The way Dr. Phil has been called out  Like, I don't know if he's allowed to practice  In all these places  As soon as he's  No, I'm just helping  Whatever the fuck his deal is  The doctor in the beginning of the name  Has been misused over the years a lot  But MD?  Yeah  I'm Dr. Jim  Dr. Jim  Get headphones on  Somebody wants to talk to you  I'm Dr. Love  Dr. Chipper  They call him  Yes  Dr. Gay  There he is  Right in there 
[01:50:00]  Uh  Nomad  From Tennessee  I am nomad  What's up  What's up, fellas  Uh, E-Rock  Eric  Ian Smith just took his dick out  And mushroom stamped you with it  Oh, not the old mushroom stamp  The good old mushroom stamping  I saw that shit  You've been talking so much shit  About his credibility  He kind of did, E-Rock  And all this  And as soon as you came in, man  He just fucking made you look like a fool, man  Holy shit  That was embarrassing  I'm embarrassed for you 
[01:50:30]  Wow  Comment, E-Rock  E-Rock  He still has not proved  He bypassed it  He goes, okay, okay, okay  And then went into the diet challenge  So how did he get on the presidential council?  Yeah  He plays basketball with, uh  There you go  Obama  Now  Obama's appointees are a little shady here and there  So I wouldn't, I wouldn't use that  Shady as in  No, no  I didn't mean it racially  I meant, uh  I don't think  I don't think his, uh 
[01:51:00]  I don't think his, uh  Credibility  He's, he's a credible guy  Whatever  He's a credible dude  You think  You think somebody who's competing with him  Might have taken umbrage with the M and the D after his name  Yeah, I think somebody would have mentioned that a lot publicly  Yeah, yeah, yeah  His books are number one and theirs aren't  You don't think E-Rock would have cracked the case on it?  No, I don't think E-Rock  I mean, I mean, again  But I think the problem was E-Rock's feelings were hurt  And E-Rock was a special boy  And he's very sensitive  And he felt like Dr. Ian Smith was a little mean to him  And he's nice to everybody  You didn't get in touch with him  And you didn't know  It wasn't a matter of getting in touch 
[01:51:30]  It was a matter of coming in here  And just being a dick  Yeah  Wow  That was the problem  And this is a guy who, who, you know  Who peddles these diets  And is supposed to help everybody  And everything  And that's fine  Pedals  What do you mean by pedals?  Like a snake oil cell  Like he's got an elixir  Yeah  The next bike is up, Eric  That's good  What is eighth book?  How many diets you have to keep repackaging?  Oh  Shit, you should have said this while I was here  Yeah, you're on fire now  You would have gotten shut down 
[01:52:00]  Yeah  And then Dr. Smith would have had some kind of response  Like, I'm not repackaging anything  There are different diets for different people  Because there are people like you  Who just can't stick to one  Oh, wow  He would have killed you  He would have murdered  He would have nailed you  What do you think?  It would have been over  Jeez  How did you end up  On Wikipedia, sorry, Sam  It says he's an American physician  Physician  From the University of Chicago  No, they're not  But, yeah  A medical, a medical degree from the University of Chicago  Wow  That's pretty impressive  In his own press kit, it says 
[01:52:30]  He attended Dartmouth Medical University  But left and went to University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine  Now, this is the line that was in question  It says  He's completed his last two years of medical education at Pritzker  Yeah  But in his own press kit  Wouldn't it have said  Received his medical degree  Or something like that?  I think that's what that means  That's what happens after you complete  You complete  Yeah  I believe so  And I think when it says Dr. Ian Smith  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I don't think he has to push the fact that he's a physician 
[01:53:00]  Maybe he just didn't word it that way  He's still not buying it  He's from Danbury, Connecticut  And he also  He did receive the Bachelor of Arts from Harvard  And he had a Master's in Science Education  Right  From Columbia  The guy's a fucking brain  Teachers College of Columbia  Yeah  So if he's using this doctorate  Then it's  Then it is  Dr. Ian Smith  He went to two of the best colleges in the country  For teaching 
[01:53:30]  He's a fucking brainiac  The guy's a bright guy  I'm not denying that  I hate to say brainiac  I should be killed for saying brainiac  Like I'm a tough hood  Do you have any confidence that Dr. Demento is indeed a physician?  I'm a big fan  You're a big fan  Instead of worshipping Dr. Who  You should worship Dr. Ian Smith  What about Dr. Who?  He calls himself a doctor  He's an alien  He does not have medical credentials  Same  And you've spent a lot of time  You're focused on the wrong doctor  Yes 
[01:54:00]  Dr. Ian Who  What?  False idol  Yeah  How did you end up in the same spot that you were in  When the whole thing started?  The exact same position  The position that pissed you the fuck off  You're now doing a guess  Because how could I say no if Roland is willing to do it?  You say fuck you is how you say no  Right  You stick your guns  Yeah  Plus you took that $500 for him before Roland was even in the room  That's true  It was just holding it like haphazardly  As it's just sitting right here 
[01:54:30]  Oh you're worried it's going to be lost  In the windstorm in the studio  Holy shit  Haphazardly  Why did you do this?  Oh E-Rock  Everyone's noticing  You're in the exact same position  And you know what Ian did?  Uh huh  He used all of E-Rock's anger  Right  To help better shill and peddle his goods  Oh yeah peddle  I mean did you hear how many times he mentioned tweeting him  His book  Yeah  His blender  Smart popcorn online 
[01:55:00]  Do you got his phone number?  Uh Roland's got it  Okay listen  I do have someone that's supporting him  For real  Let's see what Tim has to say  Tim  Hey Opie  I just wanted to say  E-Rock's got a point  Okay  About Dr. Ian  You can do all your medical coursework  And if you don't submit your dissertation  Or thesis and get it approved  You don't get your MD  You're probably right  But would you be considered a physician  Or would you put MD on the front page of your books  And no one call you out on it this day and age 
[01:55:30]  Would the president give you a job  In the way that it's worded  He did his coursework  It doesn't say anything about him receiving his degree  But he's an MD  There's a term for it  I don't know it  Because I'm not a doctor  Yeah it's called MD  Medical doctor  If you do  Shut up Sam  If you do all you say anything  And you don't get your  Sam doing his Anthony impression  It's getting good  Thank you 
[01:56:00]  There is a term for it  If you don't complete it  Are we talking about a technicality here though  Yeah yeah  I mean honestly  He's qualified  Honestly  He's a qualified  Doctors I think they disagree with you though  Oh  Yeah but that's if he's not a doctor  It says MD  What do you think that means  He's a mighty duck  He's a hockey player  Well we  Hold on  Hold on Tim  We got John in Palo Alto  We've never taken a phone call from Palo Alto before  I like it  And he has something to say  Tim's on the line with you 
[01:56:30]  John  Timmy  Yeah so  Over at Stanford  We have so many kids  That'll come in from all over the country  Just so they can finish that last year residency at Stanford  So that they can be graduates of Stanford for an MD  An MD is  There's a variety of doctors  I'm in the healthcare profession  So there's a variety of doctors  An MD medical doctor  Versus a DO  Versus a PhD  All doctors  But MD  There is no freaking way  MD can be behind your name 
[01:57:00]  Unless you haven't completed  A full course  And are licensed  In whatever state  To practice medicine  Impossible  Uh huh  Saying  Yeah dude  He's legit  I mean he's completely legit  Because if this was his first book  And he was just some guy  Remember when he was in the news a few years ago  With Michael Strahan  Where Strahan's wife was trying to throw under the bus  Or whatever  Right  All that shit would have come out  He would have been ruined  Right  I forgot about that  He's got  You don't think that TV shows check out his credentials  Or Obama's  Exactly  Right  Of course they do  Alright 
[01:57:30]  He's in darn good shape  Yeah he is  I'll say  Uh let's see  This coming from Dr. Steve  Oh great  MD means he graduated from medical school  He may not be board certified  Or have done a residency  But he is an MD  Okay  He's a doctor  Yeah  He went through the schooling  Yeah  Maybe he didn't pass the bar  Maybe  Maybe he didn't open up a little office 
[01:58:00]  And take the little rubber hammer to some kneecaps  And things like that  But he did indeed go to the schools  Could you go to  Needed  Could you go to Dr. Ian Smith's Wikipedia page  E-Rock has made it  Oh nice  Oh no  Why is it always oh no  Why is it just not going to be good  Oh it's great  Why would he say that  Eric  Oh I love it  Let's go to the Wikipedia page  Alright  Let me see  See if you can find it  The E-Rock mention  Dr. Steve is on the line  What does it say 
[01:58:30]  I'm just looking at professional career  Okay  Let's see  Ba ba ba  Appeared on  Various broadcasts to view  Tyra Banks  Ba ba ba  Newsletter  50 million pounds website  Oh  Stop saying ba ba ba  Right here at the bottom  Uh huh  Mushroom cap to Eric  From the audience show  Oh E-Rock  Immortalized on Wikipedia  That you were mushroom capped  By Dr. Ian Smith  God 
[01:59:00]  Mushroom  Mushroom  Mushroom  Capped  Oh E-Rock  Has given me the hiccups  That's a good one  E-Rock is the fucking greatest  You are the man  Let me see how to  Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve  He read your text  So why do you have to call now  Oh yeah  It's always good  It's always good hearing from Dr. Steve  Ha ha  All right  Oh no  What's up Dr. Steve  All right  He's like I don't need this shit 
[01:59:30]  All right  That's all it was  I'm going to put a hundred bucks in on this  Oh a hundred bucks  To the winner  Yeah sure why not  On the deal  Well I went for the easy bet  And now I have to pay $500 no matter what  Yeah  You're screwed  I only offered the $500  Because I didn't think E-Rock could do it  It's a hundred bucks  How come you're not going to have a hundred dollars or something  How's the show sound today 
[02:00:00]  Pretty good huh  Yeah sounds great  Oh good  All right  You are wrong  You need an MD to graduate  I don't know  But Dr. Steve  I trust  I trust  We'll take the Dr. Steve  Or maybe he's not a real doctor either  Maybe him and Ian Smith are in cahoots  Yes  And you're going to the same fake college E-Rock  Mm-hmm  Sure  Did he not go his plan?  He's mushroom capped  Mushroom capped 
[02:00:30]  That's going to make me laugh all day  You don't want to be mushroom capped ever  No  Right  Oh I don't know  I don't know  I like now it's like  E-Rock's in a position where  There's two things that can happen  One  He doesn't lose the weight  Right  And he gets mocked  And two  He does lose the weight  And he turns Ian Smith into a hero  So there's only  I mean  No win scenario  It is no win  The instructor looks good again 
[02:01:00]  He killed him  He looks good again  He mushroom capped him  Mushroom capped  Now let me ask you  When will your wife say that you need to lose weight  What will you guys be doing that she says that  I don't know  Trying on clothes  Oh  That's not good  Get something that's fit  Okay  Through the tearing sounds  I was just  It just sounds like a Velcro factory  There's a  Please lose some weight  There's moments of his wiki that are 
[02:01:30]  Wasn't that funny  That was fucking hilarious  Tearing sound  That tearing sound  Yeah  It says on Ian Smith's wikipedia page  On her professional career  Yeah  Note one  Mushroom capped  Quote unquote  Fat Eric  From the ONA show  Little update  Yeah it says  Quote  Fat Eric  Nobody calls it  And number two 
[02:02:00]  Yeah  It says  E-Rock  Loves water with powder only  Are you going to drink that cancer water still  He likes a little treat  Yeah  I tried it  It was delicious  What's in it  It's chemicals  It can't be good if it says zero calories  Zero calories  Can't taste good  Really sugary  Yeah  Yeah  It was fruit  It was blueberry  Not real though  My dad pulled that shit  Purple  When we were trying to get my dad to eat healthier 
[02:02:30]  He would eat chicken wings  He'd go  What it's chicken  Yeah  I'm like  It's a stand alone car  Cynogen  Gotta die of something  Ah there you go  Yeah but not in your 30s  No  Yeah  We all gotta die red  Yeah  Damn  He's in a pastry shop  I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here  I got a bad feeling about this one 
[02:03:00]  You rock brought us more material  You're never disappointed  Were you like a chubby kid?  No  We've seen the pictures  Yeah  Like a little kid I mean  No  Wow  No  That's so odd that that happened  It's not odd  There's too much goodness out there  Is that what it is?  Too much goodness?  You rock is America  I'm telling you  Period  He loves to consume  He is America  What? 
[02:03:30]  Just the whole scenario  Holy shit  Pitbull's only 33 years old?  No he's fucking lying about that too  He's the fucking hottest rapper in the business man  That guy's great  He's only 33?  And anybody  He looks older than us  He's not 33  He's lying  That's a lie  I'm sure  That's a blatant lie  I believe it is  It's his birthday today  And they're saying he's 33  I don't think that's true  Oh  Holy shit  And anybody who says that I don't say stuff that exists now  Sucks  Wow  Pitbull sucks  We got the guy that made the Westboro Baptist Church video  Supposedly 
[02:04:00]  Hopefully this is him  Allegedly  Allegedly  Brickstone  Is this really you?  Yeah this is me  And you're a fan of the show obviously  I'm a loyal pest for many years  Since spaz days  Yeah  Wow  Yeah the remote thing was great  Thank you  Thank you  I know it's a little outdated  But I just really wanted to Ramone them  Oh it's still great  No it works every time  So fucking funny  Dude you got balls man  I know they're not really going to do much to you  But still to get in their face like that  Is pretty impressive 
[02:04:30]  Well thanks  I mean yeah you're right  There really isn't a lot of balls  Because I mean you're surrounded by people who hate them  The cops are there to protect them from everyone else  Yeah  And it's got to be  It's got to suck to be a cop  And that's your  That's your detail  That's got to blow  No one takes them seriously though  It's like  It's so  It's so out there  That it's  It's a goof  At this point  Right  It's a joke  So  The funny thing is  The cops in LA  They just send like two cops 
[02:05:00]  Who just stand there  And they kind of seem to enjoy it  Because it's like almost a bit day off  Right yeah  Okay  When I did it  When I did it in like Orlando  They acted like it was a school shooting  There was like 20 cop cars  Oh really  There'd be a riot  Yeah  Like Virginia  They freaked out  But like New York and LA  It was great  I think it's cool  That you addressed the  The fact that they are  She had that fucking baby Sam  Out of wedlock  Yeah  Yeah  It was against a lot of her  Her views  She hates that 
[02:05:30]  Right  Yeah her husband hates  When I bring it up too  Who is the father  They never said  No I hear  He's like a guy from a halfway house  Or something  But no I never found out  Who the actual father is  You don't think her husband  Likes the fact that you bring up  That she had a kid without him  He seemed a little perturbed by it  Wow great  A little perturbed  How many of these things  Have you gone to  I've done about like  15 or 16 total  At like maybe  Six or seven different days 
[02:06:00]  Because usually when they do one  They'll do like three or four churches  In a day  So I'll just kind of  Follow them around that day  Hey were you surprised  That like Megan left the church  And there was another  Who was the other one  She was a cute one  That just left the church too  Oh Grace  Grace is the ten  Who left  She's married right  No no  You're thinking of  Lauren Drain  Lauren Drain  Was the daughter of Steve Drain  The guy who told me to repent  She quit a while ago  And then Grace and Megan  Are Shirley's daughters 
[02:06:30]  Who recently left  Megan I talked to many times  It made total sense  That she left  Because she would actually laugh  When I said something funny  Which kind of  Oh wow  So yeah  You kind of got a signal  That maybe she wasn't  Taking it as seriously  As the rest  Sorry I broke up there  You can say  That she wasn't  Taking it quite as seriously  As the other ones  Yeah yeah  She definitely wasn't  Like she  She almost seemed  Like she was kind of  There because she was  Forced to by her parents  Jafaka  I tried 
[02:07:00]  Yeah well  After she left the church  I tried to find her  On Facebook  I thought maybe  She might hate mommy  Enough to fuck me  Right  Where are her and Grace  Are they still out there  Rules  They're in Kansas  They're still out there  I heard that Megan  Was in Brooklyn  For some reason  Yeah I don't know  Where she is  But yeah  She's kind of dropped off  She's like living  A normal life  It's the weirdest thing  Cool  Wow you really  You're all in  With these people  It's just really fun  I mean I did the first one 
[02:07:30]  Just because I thought  I'd be good at this  And then it was just like  It really is  Just so much fun  To just  You spend your whole life  Not being a dick to people  Out of politeness  And then people like this  Come along  And you actually get the excuse  Right  Just great  You do a good job  Yeah well done  Absolutely  What's the YouTube channel  YouTube channel  Is just go to  Brickstone  Or go to  GodHatesBrickstone.com  GodHatesBrickstone.com  As well  Very cool  Alright man  Thank you man  Cool  Good job

[02:09:00]  Thank you  Holy shit  Very good for you man  Look at this guy's  A mover and a shaker  Yeah we're gonna  Watch the trailer now  Thanks  Thanks Brickstone  Thank you guys  Take care  We'll talk to you soon  Oh I just didn't  Make that connection  Alright  Let's watch this trailer  For this new movie  Archie fucking Black  You're making a movie  About Archie Black  Are you fucking kidding me  So then you know  Where he is  I'd rather watch  My grandmother  Getting raped 
[02:09:30]  In an alley  Ten times  In a row  By ten different guys  From the Harlem Globetrotters  Than watch you  On fucking stage  Archie  Go fuck yourself  You're terrible  You are just as bad  As Hitler  Except Hitler  Could at least  Keep the crowd's attention  You fucking prick  Wow  What made you guys  Do a documentary  About Archie Black  He didn't die  Did he  Oh  Are you sure  I got calls  Oh no  From L.A. saying  There's this guy 
[02:10:00]  Archie Black  And he's doing you  He stinks  And I don't like him  Kill yourself  You fuck sucker  Kill yourself  Go to Home Depot  Buy some clothesline  And fucking hang yourself  Talking about hemorrhoids  Doing ukuleles  About hemorrhoids  About hemorrhoids  They're not songs  They're ukuleles  They were made  For a hemorrhoid bit  And these are proud men  Even when he stole  He didn't steal correctly 
[02:10:30]  Like he's such a shitty  Fucking person  That he didn't know  How to steal material  Without people  Like he would do  My material  After I just did it  At the same show  Like how fucking stupid  Are you  I remember  We were sharing  A hotel room  And he goes  You ever see  Silence of the Lambs  And I'm like  Yeah of course I did  And he just threw  Come at me  You see 
[02:11:00]  Remember that part  I was like  Yeah  I do  It wasn't all bad  With Archie  There were good times  But at that time  We double teamed Cher  Or at least  We thought he was Cher  He was one of the greatest  Jazz trombone players  In the world  Seriously  Sly Hampton said  He was the best  White boner  He had ever seen  But he gave it all up  Sold his brass  Hadn't played 
[02:11:30]  In nearly 20 years  If you ask him  He'll tell you  He loved the music  He just couldn't stand  To be around black people  The last time I saw Archie  Was my 13th birthday  As a joke  He'd taken some red frosting  And turned the 13  On my cake  Into an 18  At least we thought  He was joking  But he kept trying  To take a picture  Of himself  Standing next to me  The 18th birthday cake  In that day's newspaper 
[02:12:00]  Dang  I don't think  He understands the law  It's supposed to be  About a  I guess a comic  Who you ever  I don't know  I guess you never see him  I didn't remember  That I had said that  That's true  You didn't even remember  I have no memory of it  Wow  Alright let's say  Out of Steve  In Milwaukee  Yes  I'm a brewer  Who spent the day  Guarding the Westboro people  How was that Steve 
[02:12:30]  How was it  It sucked  You know  Being a veteran  Being a cop  You have to listen  To these guys  They're standing  On the American flag  They're bad mouthing  Everybody  But then you have  To be nice  To them  And the only thing  I made it tolerable  Was it was overtime  To be out there  Time and a half  Yep  That is the absolutely  Only reason to be out there  That's a tough spot for you  Other than that  It just totally sucks  Right  Do you interact with them at all 
[02:13:00]  Are they polite to you  Or rude to you  I don't know  They're kind of  They were a little bit rude to us  Because then I  Of course I was wearing  Things like  I was an Iraqi veteran  And stuff on my uniform  And they look at you  And they make a comment  And they  They think you're  They try to make you  Sound like you're bad  For being over there  And it's like  Dude I'm over there  Doing a job  Protecting your right  And protecting everybody  Else's right  Yeah you're right  To do what you're doing 
[02:13:30]  There's nothing wrong  With what I did  Right  Yeah  In other countries  They'd fucking burn them alive  Yeah  No a lot of other countries  That'd agree with them  Well that's true  That came across  A few times  We wanted to  You sit there  And you want to do  Something to these guys  But you're required  Because of work  That you have to  Keep your mouth shut  Sure  Yeah of course  You don't want  You don't want to get fired  Yeah and then if I  Accidentally step out of the way  And somebody throws something  I'm well  Gee I'm sorry  I missed them  That's like fucking 
[02:14:00]  Nigeria now  You see that shit  They just passed their  Anti-gay laws  Over there  And they're just  Rounding up gays  Throwing them in jail  Jesus  I guess there's a law now  That more than two gay people  Can't congregate in one area  And it's  There's a lot of  That would break up this radio show  A lot of laws now  Anti-gay laws  In Nigeria  What a fucking  Backward shithole  Nigeria is  And you know  Where's any of this 
[02:14:30]  Fucking outright  I mean there's a  There's a Nigerian consulate  Right there  I pass it every day  On the way to the  Midtown Tunnel  Yeah  And you know  Where's the fucking  Protests  And the outrage  For that  Yeah  You say  You use the word  Faggot  Here in the United States  And they jump on you  Like you know  You're advocating  Violence against gays  When it isn't even  In that context  And then you know  There's shit like this  Going on  And no one even  How long do you go to jail  If they catch you being gay 
[02:15:00]  I don't know  Well I guess it's  What were you  14 years  14 years  For being gay  If you  Gay couples who  Openly display  Their relationship  Oh  14 years in prison  Oh  Can't do that  Wow  What if you're a tourist  Nothing  They're gonna have  A lot of tourism  I'm sure they have some  They probably lock you up  I would think  14 years  What a fucking shithole  But then you're going to jail 
[02:15:30]  Where there's a lot of goodness  That doesn't make sense  See  That's a misconception  Oh  Is it  Yeah  I think  I think  Gay guys  But now you're locked up  With all the other gay guys though  I think that  Now you're free to do  Whatever you want  Yeah  This misconception  That gay men  Would love going to prison  What  Is probably not  Very accurate  Oh  You've heard that one before  I've heard this  Like thing  Where people say  Oh wow 
[02:16:00]  He's gay  He's gonna love  I bet they don't love it  But if you can't  Show your gayness  In Nigeria  And they're throwing you  In jail  Yeah  Then there's probably  A lot more gay guys  In jail maybe  Right  But are they really  Looking at you closely  Because you're in jail  With the rest of the gay guys  Yeah  I don't think there's  A lot of outrage  By the way  Because Nigeria  Is now the 38th  African nation  That has laws  Against gay people  Of course  What's wrong with them  Over there  How about you 
[02:16:30]  Fucking make laws  That you gotta  Fucking teach your  Children how to  Get a water well  Yeah exactly  And fucking food  And planting  And uh  Oh my god  What a fucking dump  Instead of shit  On the beach  And you know  How about you  Right right  Old shit beach  From vice  Instead of gay people  Yeah  Let's go down a shit beach  And make sure there's no gays  Yeah there's some white guy  Filming a video there  With a fucking  Average looking girl  That's where that was shot  Africa's shit beach

[02:23:00]  Because he tends to be difficult  In real life  So was he like  You got quite an ego on him  No doubt  You know what I mean  It was like  You know  After  After he get to the set  You know what I mean  He wanted to be up  At the damn strip club  All night  And then come to the set  With glitter in his face  You know what I'm saying  It's like  But you know  Once we got him there  And he had his  Double latte shot  Or whatever  He wants  You know what I mean  He's good to go  Was anybody  You've ever worked with  Or was this consistently late 
[02:23:30]  I was talking to Colin Quinn  Last night  And he said that  The first thing he ever did  I think was  A Woody Allen movie  As an extra  And he was four hours late  Every day  To the set  He was or Woody  No Colin was  Nobody would question Woody  Colin was four hours late  Are you an idiot  As a nobody  Damn  You're fired  Yeah  Exactly  So nobody  No no  Nobody's that late  Not on my movies  They better bring their ass in  Or I'll go get them  Do you executive produce them  I produce them  Oh you do  Wow  Yeah  Me and Will Packer 
[02:24:00]  And Matt Alvarez  You know  Did the heavy lifting  On this  What's the gist  What's the gist  Of this one now  What's the gist  We got  I know you  You're a cop  Yeah  Well Kevin is a  Wannabe cop  He's a security guard  Right  School security  Who wants to be a cop  And  But he has to impress me  Who he wants to be  Also  He wants to be my brother-in-law  Because he wants to marry my sister  Oh it's your sister  Okay  So I hate him  And I want to just scare the shit out of him 
[02:24:30]  You know what I mean  Take him on a ride  It looked funny  The trailer  Looked really funny  Absolutely  Yeah it's a funny movie  You know  We knew we had to  Try to get in that  Bad boys  Rush hour  Right  Lethal weapon  48 hours  We was trying to get in that stratosphere  And we did a hell of a job  I think we  We closed  Hopefully  They're making a spot on that  Mount Rushmore  For us  Have you ever  Have you ever gone on a ride along with cops 
[02:25:00]  I mean  In my professional life  Personally  I'm sure personally  I'm sure personally  I'm sure  I'm sure  My question is  Why does the back seat  Have to be so damn uncomfortable  I mean  Damn  You know  Your knees  Up against  The board  Seat hard as a rock  We got a nice courtesy ride  In Philly  With the Philly cops  To a venue  That we had to be at  And they shoved us 
[02:25:30]  In the back seat  And man  That was bad  It was like  A bench seat  Like from McDonald's  Like hard  Hard as a rock  And they're making these turns  And you're just sliding into the doors  Back and forth  It was pretty cool though  Yeah  You like that  Well you know  Again  As long as you don't have the handcuffs on  Exactly  You know you're getting out  Yeah  Exactly  You're not going to be fucked with  With the handcuffs  You know  Uh uh  You're sliding all over the place  Yeah  Do you get a response from the cops  Playing a cop  Based on 
[02:26:00]  You know  Earlier in your career  Obviously  There's a little more  Of a controversy  Cops have always been cool with me  You know  Especially after I got famous  You know  Right  Before I was famous  It was a different story  But  After that  They've always  You know  Been cool  And  And I like cool cops  You know what I mean  It's just  Yeah  Yeah  The dickheads  I don't like  You know what I mean  And the ones that abuse  Their power  And the ones who  Cover up for each other  Uh  And you know  I mean  That ain't really  What it's all about  So  You're describing every profession though 
[02:26:30]  There's dickheads  In every profession  Pretty much  You know  It's dickheads everywhere  But the guy at the dock counter  Can't fucking beat you down  You know  You can beat his ass down  If you  Get out of line  I  I  I  Just want to talk a little bit  About earlier  Earlier in your career  Uh  When you were  Singing and shit  And rapping  Uh  The storylines  Of a lot of the songs  Especially looking back now  Are so outrageous  Yeah  I mean  You know  There's no way  Someone could just be 
[02:27:00]  Walking down the street  Fucking AK  In hand  Shooting up shit  How much of that was true  And how much of it was  Kind of elaborated  Elaborated about  I mean  You've never been to Campton  You know  Especially in the 80's  And the 90's  You know  AK's walking down the street  It's not unusual  You know  You know  What I'm saying  What it is  It's the unpredictableness  Of the neighborhood  You know  It'd be a week  When nothing happened  Everything is cool  You know  You southern  Sunny California  Right  Next evening 
[02:27:30]  You know  You hear about your man  That got shot at the store  Up the street  And got killed  And you know  It's just that kind of deal  You know  It's like living in a  In a war zone  Right  And you got snipers  You know what I'm saying  So you're not going to write shit  About the week  Where it was all nice and sunny  So  It sounded like  24 hours a day  It was just like  You were on  Mayhem  No no  Red alert  No no  It wasn't 24 hours a day  You know  I got songs like  It was a good day  That kind of  That's true  That's true  And you know  The movie Friday 
[02:28:00]  Is how  Fantastic  How we saw the neighborhood  You know  It was  A lot of crazy shit going on  But it was fun  You know what I mean  It was  What a crossover movie that is  I mean  Fucking white people  And black people  Thought that was one of the  Funniest fucking movies man  Yeah man  It's one of those movies dude  That  Everybody's had those  You know  How many  You know  You've kicked it on the porch  With your buddies  Coming through  Tripping off the neighborhood  Everybody can have a Friday  Yeah yeah  And it's millions of  Friday movies going on 
[02:28:30]  All through the world  You know what I mean  People hanging out  Tripping off their neighborhood  Crazy people they know  In their neighborhood  And I think that's  That's the connection  With the movie  Yeah  What an iconic line too  Knocked the fuck out  Became  Wow right  Yeah  That became such a  Bigger than that movie  Yeah you know  It's like  It's one of those lines  That  You'd be like  Damn you know  That's the perfect thing  To say  To somebody  Who just got knocked out  You know  If you want to  Just let them know  What happened 
[02:29:00]  You know what I'm saying  Cause when you get knocked out  You might not know  What happened  Right right right  So it's cool  To have somebody there  To give you a tagline  From a movie  It was a perfectly  Honest assessment  Of what had just happened  It was just really unpleasant  Do you go back to Compton  Still  Every now and then  Every now and then  We do our thing  But you know  I'm actually from  South Central Los Angeles  You know  Everybody else  Was from Compton  And if you  If you put a distance on it  It's about  Ten miles away  Right right  You know  But you know  I was the only one 
[02:29:30]  That was actually  From South Central Los Angeles  Mike  I'm reading Mike Tyson's book  Which is amazing  I'm just about done  Yeah  What's amazing to me  He always went back  To Brownsville  Yeah  Always  On a regular basis  Not just a little  Oh let me go back  And see the boys  You know  He was going there  But it was to get in trouble  It was  It was unbelievable  That he didn't separate himself  From all that trouble  Even when he was so famous  Yeah  And you know  My father still lived  In the same house  I grew up in  And so I go back  All the time  And you know  I got guys with me 
[02:30:00]  From my neighborhood  So you know  I have a close connection  Because you know  It's where I come from  It's really who I am  Right  You know  Ultimately  And your dad  Never wanted to leave  No  He said  You know  I tried to buy him a house  I would assume  Sure  I bought my own  God damn house  I bought this  With my own damn money  Good for him  I bought this  With my own damn money  Okay  No problem  You want a car  Yeah  You can give me that  Nice car  I was going to say  I bet you at least  Pimped out his house  For him a little bit  Yeah  A little bit  Okay  It's one of the sweetest 
[02:30:30]  House on the planet  If not the sweetest  Did you see yourself  Like did you have a game plan  When you first started  Getting popular  And was this anywhere  On your radar  Where you are now  Making movies  Actually making  You know  Family friendly comedies  And stuff  Well you know  It's a trip  Because  If somebody gave me  A pin and a pad  When I was  14, 15  And said  Hey you want to be famous  Write out what you want to be  What you want to do  I think I ought to  Short change myself 
[02:31:00]  You know  Compared to what's  Really happened  Right  It's just been  It's been  It's been  Being in the right place  At the right time  Mixed with  Recognizing opportunities  Mixed with  Proper planning  You know  I went  A year to  Architectural drafting school  And I didn't  Learn shit from  The certificate  But to  Plan out  You can't build  Nothing  Without the plan  You know what I mean  So you got to  Have a plan  Before you can  Build anything  So I just took that 
[02:31:30]  And kind of  Applied it to  My career  Do you look back  At the controversies  In your career  Now in hindsight  And think  How kind of silly  They  And almost innocent  They were  For  What we're looking  At now  I mean  It was almost  Kind of funny  Back then  It's not funny  Living it  You know  I don't doubt it  But in hindsight  It's like  Oh god  They were pissed  At that  Like look at  What's going on  Yeah I mean  You know  Growing up 
[02:32:00]  You know  Our world  Was  Gang banging  Drugs  In the neighborhood  You know  Police abuse  LAPD  You know  And that  That kind of  Engulfed us  You know  So the music  Was our only weapon  You know  It was our only means  To defend ourselves  From what was happening  And to shout it out  To the world  Which we didn't think  Cared  You know  What I'm saying  And you know  With records  And movies  Like Boys in the Hood 
[02:32:30]  And things like that  We realized  That the world  Did care  And it was  Going through  Similar things  In pockets of  Communities  All through  The country  All through the world  So you know  We had a narrow view  Of the world  Back then  You know  What I'm saying  It was  It was an isolated view  Of what the world  Was about  Were you surprised  At how many  Young white guys  Got so into that  Into your music  At first I was  You know  I didn't think  It was  I didn't think 
[02:33:00]  It was going to  Catch on  You know  What I'm saying  With that crowd  But in thinking  About it  You know  This is who  We wanted  To listen to the music  This is who  We wanted  To hear our story  And our plight  Because  Yeah you're not  Just preaching  To the converted  Yeah right  Black people already  Knew what was going on  You know  This was like  Yo this is  We shouting this out  To the world  And thank god  The world was listening  How hard is it  When you write  If you write something now  Like lyrically  To reach back  And kind of capture  The way you felt then 
[02:33:30]  To keep the music consistent  Or do you just have to change  Everything you write about  No you know  I still  I still got feelings  About what's going on  In South Central  And in a lot of  Communities across  The nation  And the country  You know  I still have feelings  About what's going on  You know  Me as an individual  My particular situation  Has been a very blessed one  But you know  I still think  I'm in a position  To speak for people  Who can't speak for themselves  You know what I mean  It's still going through it 
[02:34:00]  So you know  Those lyrics come  Just as easy to write  As they did back then  And who were you  Kind of looking up to  Back then  Growing up  Were there any  Oh man  Like archaic rappers  At this point  That you're like  Oh yeah  Of course  I mean  I wouldn't call them  Archaic  You know  I just call them  Old school  You know  Melly Mel  Rakim  Chuck D  You know  These are  These are some of the  Flies  Karis one  You know 
[02:34:30]  I mean  Some of the  Influential MCs  From back in the day  But also people like  Muhammad Ali  Richard Pryor  George Clinton  You know  I mean  It was a few influences  Yeah  Any white guys  Huh  Any white people  Oh yeah  Yeah  You know  I was into  You know  A lot of sports figures  You know  What I'm saying  But you know  These are the people  That was very influential  On me 
[02:35:00]  And they helped  Kind of shape  What the music  I would do  And how I felt  About things  And it was pretty good  Does it put you  In an awkward position  Thinking now  You are kind of  An icon  And someone  To look up to  And somebody  To you know  Kind of be inspired by  Did you ever  See that coming  You would hope that  You know what I'm saying  Because  When I first started  I just wanted to be  The best rapper  In the world  You know  I had a narrow view  Of what I wanted to do  And you know  You want to get respect 
[02:35:30]  In this game  Whatever game you're in  I think you want to be  Respected by your peers  Sure yeah  And fans  For what you do  And to get that respect  And gain that respect  It's humbling  You know  It's not strange  Because this is where  I wanted to be  You know  So it's just a thing  Where I just accept  What I am  And who I am  And just be true to myself  And in turn  Fans feel like  I'm being true to them  Are the audiences  Any different  Because I think  Who Kids said  That the rap audiences  Were different now 
[02:36:00]  Than they were  Maybe 10 or 15 years ago  Where they kind of  Years ago  Cared about a guy  Being exactly  Who he said he was  And coming from a certain area  And now that they're  Not as concerned with that  You know  It fluctuates  You know  I remember  You couldn't bite  Back then  You know  Back in the day  Right right right  If I use a scratch  On my record  Chip chip chip  You cannot do the same  Damn scratch  On your record  Or people would just  Kill you  You know what I mean  You're just the wackest  But then it comes to a point 
[02:36:30]  Where biting is cool  You know  Still a line from Jay-Z  Still one from Biggie  Take one from Tupac  Make a song together  You know what I mean  So it's just  These things fluctuate  And then you know  It was like  Yo  You know  If you murder  If you say you murder  Somebody on a record  We want murderers to rap  You know what I mean  It got to the point  Where we don't want  Artists to rap  We need  You know  Convicted murderers  Right right  To tell  Because nobody can 
[02:37:00]  Can  You know  Express themselves  Unless you  Actually did that  You know what I'm saying  Which is silly  You know what I mean  It's like  So  You know  Rap always  Kind of morphs  But when it really  What it really boils down to  Is the skills  Do you got the skills  Can you  Can you present  Deliver  Can you rhyme  Can you keep me interested  Do you got the flavor  You know  That's really what it boils down to  You know  After you wipe out  All this other stuff 
[02:37:30]  What started  I remember when I was in high school  And rap was  Like the idea of a rap battle  Was like DJ Red Alert  And Marley Marl  Would have these  Like back and forth things  And then something happened  With the east coast  And the west coast  And I don't know what it was  That started the whole  Thing down that weird path  That went down for a while  Well I think it was  A combination of things  You know  You know  New York being superior  In rap  For so long  You know  Here come a new style  Gangsta rap  That was kind of  Took a lot of attention 
[02:38:00]  Away  You know  And it was cool at first  But you know  It was like  Year after year  You know what I mean  It started to be like  Okay  Enough of this  In a way  And  A saying started  Coming out of New York  Keep it real  You know  This is real rap  You know  That's  You know  Bullshit  And then  Tim Dogg  Tim Dogg  Did a song called  Fuck Compton  And it just  Was like  Whoa  You know  Wow  You know  I'm saying  So  I just think  It festered 
[02:38:30]  In the industry  Not with the people  Not with the fans  But in the industry  It just festered  And then  Things like  The Source Awards  I think it was  95  Where  You know  Shud got up there  And said shit about  How Puffy was doing it  And those things  Just started to  Snowball  You know  Biggie and Pac  Being the biggest rappers  At the time  It just  It just  Snowballed into  A whole issue  But when you really  Think back  You know  There is no issue 
[02:39:00]  It ain't where you're from  It's where you're at  You know  Rakim said that  In 86  So  It ain't where you're from  It's where you're at  When it comes to music  And that's where we are  Right now  Yeah  I don't seem to hear about it anymore  It just seemed like  At one point  I was always wondering  What kind of  Actually  Set that off  I guess it started  Because it seemed like  New York rap was  Good  But it didn't seem like  It was as  It didn't talk about  The same stuff  Or it didn't seem to  Talk about it  With the same intensity  As guys from the  West coast did  Yeah I mean  You know  One thing about 
[02:39:30]  New York rap  It had  All different flavors  Of it  You know  It wasn't just one style  It was  Many styles  You know  And  The predominant style  Out the west  Back then  Was gangster rap  So  It was kind of  You know  Like a new phenomenon  And  I think  People just got mad  That  You know  The west coast  Was getting so much attention  And it didn't look like  It was ever going to swing back  And  You know  Wu-Tang 
[02:40:00]  Started to bring it back  You know  I mean  Really  Towards the east  Where people were saying  Yo  It's good music  Coming out of everywhere  When you started  When you started to get famous  Was there any point  Where you went back  Or  Encountered guys  That you grew up with  Who kind of  Didn't like the fact  That you were changed  Because you have to change  A little bit  I guess  When things start to go well  Hell yeah  You change  You better change  Wouldn't it be the same  Like  You want to sit around here  Hell nah  You know what I mean  You better get better  Yeah  Yeah  You know  You always got them haters 
[02:40:30]  You know what I'm saying  They got  They got a lot of shit to say  Behind your back  When they see you  It's all love  You know what I mean  Yeah  You know  I just  I just brush them off  I don't worry about them  You know what I mean  They know what time it is  You know what I mean  They know what was up with me  Before I left  And it's the same thing  If I come back  Same thing  You know what I mean  So  They know Ice Cube  Used to knuckle them up  Back in the day  And they ain't got no problem  Knuckling them up again  You know what I mean  Anybody wants some  Don't you think  People almost want to be knuckled up  Because there's a big payday  At the end of it 
[02:41:00]  Like Kanye West  They said he just hit this guy  It's like  What the fuck are you doing dude  You're gonna get  It's gonna cost you $400,000  Yeah no doubt  You gotta think about that  You gotta think about that  I only hit people I know  I don't ever want  I don't ever want to be  Knuckled up by Ice Cube  No  You know they don't  I would never  I would suck  Being in the business part  Of making films  How  How much do you enjoy  That part of it  Because you gotta be  You're entrenched man  Yeah it's  It's a necessary evil 
[02:41:30]  You know  Especially if you want  To be a producer  Right  Producing is where  All the action is  You know  I don't care  You know  Actors have fun  Directors have fun  But producers are like  You have  Like a GM  You know what I mean  You're in charge  Of the whole team  You know  The coach  The players  You know  Directors like a coach  And actors  And actors are like  Players  And so  To be in that position  You know  It's a very creative position  But it's also 
[02:42:00]  Sometimes can be  You know  Tedious  You've been in place  And juggling  At the same time  Yeah but it's fun  You know  It's really about  Trying to create  This big thing  That we all  Envision in our head  And it's just  On a whole creative  You know  Juice level  Where do you find  The people  That you surround  Yourself with  The loyalty  You need  And the trust  You know  Just through  You know  You know  You got to have  Kind of an apprenticeship  With my team  You know  I mean 
[02:42:30]  You got to kind of  Come around  And show your worth  Kind of prove yourself  Prove yourself  And it could last  As long as I see fit  You know  I mean  It might be  You know  Six months  It might be  Eighteen months  You know  I mean  But until I feel  Like you're part of the team  And that you're loyal  And you  You know  You're going  In the same direction  As the Ice Cube  Ship is going  Then  Then you become  Part of the team  How do you let someone  Know that they're not  Quite cutting it  And it might be  Time to leave  Are you a good firer 
[02:43:00]  Or do you  I'm very good  No problem  Sit you down  I usually have a laundry list  Of the reasons  Why you can't  You don't stand  And um  Usually when they hear that  They usually say  Yeah  You know  Thanks anyway  I try to do better  Next time  What's  What's the best way  To get  To get booted  From your  Is it  To fuck up on the road  Like with women  Or  Cause that's  It costs me  A whole lot of money  You know  If you cost me  A whole lot of money  Like you have 
[02:43:30]  A major fuck up  Then that  That could get you  Instantly off the team  Or  You mess up something  Um  Uh  You know  Lose my computer  Lose my iPad  You know  It's like  That  That's  That's  Goodbye  Yeah  That's the death penalty  Someone lost your computer  One of my guys  Set it down  In a  Uh  We was in a  Swedish airport  And I'm like  Dude  Where's my bag at  Oh  Shit  Oh  God 
[02:44:00]  Started running back  And  Luckily my bag was  Sitting right there  Wow  Sitting right there  Wow  It's like  Dude  You almost had a  A  Boat trip  Get your ass a canoe  Going back on the canoe  No shit  God damn  And you're gonna be producing  The N.W.A. movie  Yeah  Yeah  N.W.A. movie  Did you start that up yet  Or  Well we started  The pre-production process  Yeah  You know  We  Casting the movie 
[02:44:30]  And just trying to  Get the right  Players in place  Wow  It's incredible  You know  I never thought  You know  When they did  Boys in the hood  I never  I was like  Damn  This is about  This is about  How we grew up  You know  Who the fuck  You know what I mean  Yeah  Who the fuck about this  So  You know  When N.W.A.  It's even more surreal  It's like  Damn  This is how  I grew up  You know what I'm saying  And  I got a better attitude  I think people give a fuck now  But 
[02:45:00]  But  You know  It's exciting man  You know  It's exciting  To try to  Put your story up on the screen  And show  Show the world  What's up with the world's most dangerous group  What's something that we would see in there  That  We just wouldn't expect  Or wouldn't know about  The band  Oh man  It's really  It's really deep  You know what I mean  Seeing  You know  Easy go through  You know  The situation with AIDS  Yeah  You know what I mean  A lot of stuff  I learned during the movie 
[02:45:30]  Because  When I broke up with N.W.A.  I didn't really have a lot of contacts  So  I learned shit about N.W.A.  In making the movie  And getting Ren's story  And getting Dre's story  And getting DJ Yella's story  Just hearing all these back things  That happened  And nobody know about  So  I feel like  If it was informative to me  Right  Yeah  Yeah  It's gonna be informative  And heavy shit  To everybody else  Who's gonna play you?  Is that gonna be the hardest  Part to cast? 
[02:46:00]  You know  I want my son to play me  Does he look just like you?  He looks just like me  He can rhyme  He can act  So  You know  It's really all about  You know  F. Gary Gray's a director  You know  I don't wanna  I don't wanna push nobody on you  How old's your son?  He's 22  Oh okay  So I don't wanna push nobody on you  But  But he understands  He has  He's gonna have to make the right move  The kid is in the movie  Right  Some guy's like  I think Denzel would be a good me  I think Denzel  I think Denzel would look good 
[02:46:30]  Oh that's pretty cool  Hey  Did you guys go through any  Any early in the days  With producers or whatever  Ripping you guys off  I mean  It seems like every band  Goes through that  Early in the career  No  It was a  It was a manager  Jerry Heller  Oh man  Yeah  The evil  Jerry Heller  Everybody gets fucked  There's always one manager in the past  Right  What did he do to you?  Well you know  He was the manager of NWA  And he's the reason why  I broke up with the group  Because once I realized  He was a crook  I was out of there 
[02:47:00]  Yeah  And this dude is like  He was like a  You know how he ended up  Managing NWA  Is funny because  We used to go get our records  Pressed at this  Pressing plant  Called McCullough  And he's like  He's like an  Amelance chaser  You know what I mean  He's kind of manager  He's just sitting in McCullough  Waiting for somebody to  Show up  Show up with a hit  Oh shit  And was like  Yo  You know  Wow  I used to work with  You know  He started name dropping  And shit  And  And 
[02:47:30]  Easy  You know  Ended up hooking up  With the dude  And  You know  Trusting this dude  And  He's good  What is he doing now  That guy  I don't know  You know  Probably  Collecting souls  For the devil  I don't know  It's good you don't know  Oh my god  Yeah it is good  And it's very good you don't know  How did you find out about Easy  Like what  That he was sick  Did he tell you  Or was it  It just came out  When Easy was sick  Oh um 
[02:48:00]  My friend  My friend's mother  Worked at the hospital  Oh wow  And  Told my friend  And he told me  And I  You know  I thought he was Bush  And I was like  Man stop playing  Cause it  You know  Everybody know that  Me and Easy  Had our problems  Back in the day  So I thought  He was just  Kind of  Trying to  You know  Throw some shit  I'm like man  You know  There ain't nothing  To play with  Stop playing  And then  Two days later  You know  It was  He was doing a press conference 
[02:48:30]  Oh okay  How long was that  Before he died  It was really close  It was quick  It was quick  And it was like  You know  It seemed  I mean I found out  On maybe Thursday  I think he was gone  By Sunday or Monday  Wow  Fuck  Yeah  That's like what  90  Long before  Like a lot of  You know  I think like before  Magic Johnson  Right  That was like 90  No it's after  It was 95  He died  Easy died 95  Imagine  Right around 90  Ish  Yeah you're right 
[02:49:00]  90  91  91 maybe  Oh yeah  That's right  He was on the  In hindsight  Do you think about  His lifestyle  And be like  Oh yeah  Okay  I could see how  That would happen  Or  Yeah  Yeah  I could see  Yeah  You know  Easy  He was  He was crazy  He was  A thrill seeker  Yeah  That's what we call it  Thrill seeker  You know  So I saw it  And you know  And we put it in the movie  You know  It's in there  It's in there  His  You know  How  How nonchalant 
[02:49:30]  And  Dismissive  He was  Of  You know  AIDS  HIV  All that  He didn't  He didn't give a shit  Was he  A thrill seeker  With sex  Or with drugs  Do you mean  With sex  Okay  Sex  I don't even think  He took drugs  He might have drunk  Smoked a little  He didn't drink  And he might have  Smoked a little weed  What a fucking  Distinctive voice  On him too  It's like  Listening to that stuff  When he kicks in  When his voice  Comes on  It's like  You almost want to 
[02:50:00]  Start like  Laugh  It's so  Yeah  Original  And unique  And  Man he was  Fucking good  Yeah  Yeah you know  And the trip thing about it  He never wanted to be a rapper  Really  He just wanted to be a manager  And  He had managed a group  Called  HBO  Homeboys only  They was out of Queens  One of them looked like LL  You know what I mean  And I  Easy had me write him a song  Called  Boys in the Hood  Wow  Yeah 
[02:50:30]  And they didn't want it  They was like  Man what the fuck  What's  What's a 6-4  We're getting ganked  I don't know  What this  Easy  We can't do this  But his name was Eric  Eric we can't do this  So  They left  Easy was like  Man I ordered this studio time  Y'all don't  Get the fuck out  You know  It was an argument  They left  So we was sitting there  And Dre was like  Eric won't you do the damn song  We already got the studio time  He was like  Man I ain't no damn rapper  I don't rap

[02:58:00]  Don Wicky Wicklin  Who else  No one survived that merger  That was a bloodbath  As they say  Wicky did certainly  But all like the  People in the managerial positions  Oh yeah they were  When the merger happened  They had to kind of have  A balance  They had to have  Kind of a 50-50 thing  Uh huh  And then when that  Didn't matter anymore  Those guys  Get out  They got wiped out  Yeah  So  Yeah  I'm glad to see  Wicky made it through  You're a good guy  Yeah he's a soldier  Good egg  He's absolutely a soldier 
[02:58:30]  What's this Obama clip  About a pen and a phone  I don't know this one  I think Obama just says  Like fuck Congress now  Right  I got me a pen  I could sign shit  Oh really  I got fucking things  I want to pass  I don't want it  Sitting there with  You know  Congress debating it  So I'm just going to  Start signing some  Executive orders  And shit  Fuck it  Oh good  The big clip  That was everywhere yesterday  Yeah  We are not just going  To be waiting for legislation  In order to make sure  That we're providing  Americans  The kind of help 
[02:59:00]  That they need  I've got a pen  And I've got a phone  And I can use that pen  To sign executive orders  And take executive actions  And administrative actions  That move the ball forward  And I've got a phone  That allows me to convene  Americans from every walk  Like nonprofits  Businesses  To try to bring  More and more  Americans together  Around what I think  Is a unifying thing  Making sure that  This is a country  Where if you work hard 
[02:59:30]  You can make it  What?  Can they make a quieter  Camera  No  SLRs are noisy  Fucking cameras  I know  You would think  They would figure that  Out a little bit  It's that mirror  Yeah  Fucking mirror  That's got to  Snap up and down  Yeah  Who thought of that one  I'm amazed  I'm amazed at the SLR  It really is  Like  It seemed like  Such a simple thing  Look  We need to be able  To look through the lens  When we take a picture  Right  But the lens is busy 
[03:00:00]  At the time  Right  You can't be looking at it  So what do we do  We'll put a mirror there  And then right  At the last minute  It'll lift off  And take a picture  It's a crazy way  To do things  But they are  Fucking noisy  It just blows your mind  It's amazing  People think it is  There was a time  That someone came up  With this concept  That I think  I could take a  That they didn't call  A picture probably  Yeah yeah yeah  An image of you  An image  What are you talking about  See how you are  Right now  I could put that  Right  On a  Flat surface 
[03:00:30]  A flat surface  And then you could  Look at it  Why it's witchcraft  You're talking  How the fuck  I guess it started  By having mirrors  If we take  Yeah  If we take the light  You see what  You see what  You could see in a mirror  Yeah  I could put that on  Some kind of  Flat surface  Permanently  See the light  Has to  Oh my  And then it becomes  Something like  I don't even know  But then they figured it out  And then digital photography  Is even more ridiculous  It's 
[03:01:00]  Because at least with film  It's literally the light  Right  It's the visual light  Right  Hitting a surface  That reacts to the light  Right  But now when you talk  Digitally  And then when you talk  Transmitting pictures  Over  Hey wait a minute  You're sending that picture  Over the air  And it's rematerializing  And then someday  We're going to take this image  Of you on this flat surface  And then you're going to be able  To send it to anywhere  In the world  Anywhere  What  Just send it 
[03:01:30]  How do you do that  Well we rip it apart  Into fucking electrons  Sure  And we fly it through the air  And then we reassemble  The whole thing  It's insanity  And my point  We still don't know shit  No  We think now that  Because we're in this time period  Like oh  We figured out everything  Those dummies  Couldn't figure out  Yeah  Yeah  But it just proves  We don't even know shit still  Really don't  We are amazed  With our toys though  Right 
[03:02:00]  We do love  Our fucking toys  Our electronics  Our phones  Our fucking  Well what else do we have  We really don't have much  We don't have quad anymore  We don't have god  We don't believe  In our country anymore  Quad  Quad and country  Well Davey  Davey and Goliath  Davey used to say it like that  Dad  What would god think  Well Davey  There is no god  Oh my god  That is  Yeah  Yeah  My um  My kid had  Explosive diarrhea  Last night  And 
[03:02:30]  What a nightmare  And he shits on his  Portable toilet  In the  In the big living room  I have  But he has this  His privacy  Portable  He has his privacy  How does he have his privacy  If it's in the living room  He has his privacy area  He builds all sorts of walls  And will yell out  You know  Privacy  Does he  Stink the whole room up  Well that's why  I'm bringing it up  I mean  Trust me  I can have a kid's story  Every day  I understand  The ones I should tell him  Which ones  And which ones  And which ones I shouldn't  But I'm like  You can have privacy 
[03:03:00]  In one of the many bathrooms  We have  Do you understand  He doesn't understand  That concept  I'm like  If you're really worried  About privacy  Which we're teaching him  Obviously  You can have privacy  You just walk off  And go do it  But he doesn't understand  That yet  Do what parents did  In our day and age  Shame them  Make them ashamed  Of their bodies  Right  And he has  A little stomach thing  So the first time  He has experienced  Liquid diarrhea  Uh oh  So he has to comment on it 
[03:03:30]  I gather  He did  The first one  That made me laugh  My ass off  Was just a quick  Ew  It stinks  It's the first time  That he's understanding  That poo stinks  You gotta go  Son  It's a lifetime  Left of that  All those other times  When I'm changing  His diapers  Before this and stuff  Where I'm gagging  Yeah  It goes from  Something you can  Easily handle  When they're very small  Babies  To holy fuck  This is like  A homeless person's shit 
[03:04:00]  That I have to deal with now  Yeah some bacterians  And enzymes kicked in  Well for some reason  He's never smelled it  In that way  Until last night  Was the first time  He realized  Oh my god  This could really stink  And then the other thing  He had to point out  Over and over again  That his poo  Looks like chocolate  See  But that becomes a joke  And stuff  When you  When you grow up  It becomes  You fuck around with pudding  And you go  But it's the one  It's the one fun thing  About being a parent 
[03:04:30]  You do realize  Where this shit comes from  Because we were too young  To understand I guess  Right  But you're right  If he's saying  Oh my god  My poo looks like chocolate  That is going to lead  To all the jokes  It leads to  Press the button  Pull the chain  Out comes the chocolate  Choo choo train  Exactly  Out comes a tootsie roll  And milk milk  Lemonade  Yes  And around the corner  Fudge is made  Now I understand  Where that comes from  Oh fucking  Kids are genius  I guess every kid  Just thinks they're  You know  They're shit  Oh they love it  It looks like chocolate 
[03:05:00]  They love it  Oh it's brutal  It looks like chocolate  Did you have a name  For diarrhea  When you were a kid  Did you call it something  Diarrhea cha cha cha  You sing the song  Diarrhea cha cha cha  I was all about  That song myself  Yeah  I don't  Man I don't know  It was just fucking diarrhea  I called it drippy poo  Well we're not  The Hershey squirts  Oh  And we're not that much  Older than you  So  Yeah  Children of the 80s  So it's obvious  That you would be doing  Diarrhea cha cha cha  As well  Yeah  No I think  I picked it up  From that movie  Parenthood with Steve Martin  Or something  You guys are much  Much older than I am 
[03:05:30]  Parenthood  With Steve Martin  Yeah I don't know  I was very very young  When that movie came out  Well that's what  Beavis and Butthead  Used to call  Diarrhea  Diarrhea cha cha cha  Right  Right  Hey it's diarrhea  Yeah  So  That was hilarious  When he had the realization  That poo stinks  Happened last night  I'm like  Yeah it does  Those moments  Did you put it in a scrapbook  You should have  Put it in his baby book  Next to his first haircut 
[03:06:00]  There's a nice  A nice poo smear  A smear  A little smear  And this was the day  That you realized  Shit sticks  So I took a little of it  And smeared it  On your baby book  Well I didn't do that  Baby book shit  No  I think we did like  The first page  And then  It's like F  I guess  Yeah I think we got his  Like birth weight  And how fucking  How many inches he was  You need to know  Maybe a piece of hair  That's about it  There's a lot of empty pages 
[03:06:30]  Of that book  It's like Jesus  You know about him  As a baby and 30  Right  That's all you need to know  You realize you got  A lot of other things to do  But I'm busy  For the love of God  Well it's just a drop off  From the first and second kid  The first kid  When he had his hair cut  Fucking full video made  Oh my god  Look at this  And my daughter  Had her first haircut last night  Yeah  It's not even a picture  That's how it goes  It's not even a picture  That's how it goes  That's bad parenting  I think  I remember being out 
[03:07:00]  With people  And they had their first kid  And it's really crazy  And every little thing  That went on  There was the  The big bag  With disinfectant wipes  And all kinds of stuff  And no don't touch that  I think  Right  And then by the second kid  Just the second kid  Stuff's falling on the floor  They just pick it up  Put it back up  For the kid  No more disinfecting  And  Oh my god  Oh it has to be her though  Fuck  Oh god  I call 
[03:07:30]  I call my diarrhea  Lady Trucker  But  Oh  We have Lady Trucker  On the line  With what she calls  Her diarrhea  Hey Lady Trucker  With her sexy voice  What's up  L.T.  We used to call  Diarrhea  Runny grunny  Growing up  What's grunny  Runny grunny  Runny grunny  That is pretty bad  But what does  Grunny mean  Well it counts  Because when you  Poo you go grunt  She's right  Well you don't have  To grunt  With diarrhea  I didn't think  The ladies grunted 
[03:08:00]  When they  You might moan  A little bit  You might go  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah but it's not  A grunt  Like  Yeah  I get a good grunt  Oh fuck  Oh god  There's no  No good will come  Of grunting  Mine came out  Like a giant pen  Today  What  You know  Like a giant  Like this  But then it's  Tapered off  Where the point  Would be  Was it a good  Dual taper  It was very impressive  Nice 
[03:08:30]  But then I had  A crayon wipe  I had to finally  Just give up  This is another one  In the chamber  That is so  Fucking disgusting  I hate the crayon  The crayon wipe  Crayon  Yeah you just  I've said it many times  It's just grinding  Down a crayon  There's no end to it  You have to mush up  The tip of it  Grinding down  I've said this  Many times  On the show  I never really understood  That it's like  Because you never  Get rid of the crayon  No  That's how it is wiping  There's a crayon 
[03:09:00]  Poking out basically  Because there's  Another one in the  Chamber  So  Oh this is  So fucking disgusting  Wait I had a point  On the crayon  No  Fuck  Lady trucker  Fuck you  Oh lady trucker  I shut the door  And let the faucet run  Every time I go  So Jess doesn't hear  Any grunts  Or plops  Or anything  You are a gentleman  That's what you gotta do  With a young lady  In the house  Like that  You don't go  Shitting and farting  And fucking stinking up  In front of the lady 
[03:09:30]  No way  I did it last night  Oh what did you do  Well cause we have kids now  You'll see  When the kids come  Every door is open  Oh no  You can't do that  You shit with the door open  Not even a faucet  No faucet running  Door open  You have no idea  What you're  What's  Holy shit  That's like  You don't have a moment  To yourself  When you have a kid  Do you understand that  You can't shut the door  No because  You don't have time  To yourself  While they're awake  Can you bring the kids  In with you  And then shut the door  Oh god  You do that too  You shit right in front of them 
[03:10:00]  Oh my god  That's gotta fuck them up  Well that's  You don't know  I can't imagine  Well you don't know  What one thing  Is gonna fuck them up  That's  That's  I would say  Dragging them into the bathroom  That's the scariest part  About being a parent  Locking them into your shit chamber  They're just fucking  Everything stinks  So I don't know  What do you give them  A little toy to play with  Or something  Yeah you keep them busy  Which is whatever  But  Do they laugh  When you make like  Sounds  No they don't really  You know what you could do  Give them a toy  Put them in the bathtub  Shut the shower curtain 
[03:10:30]  Right  Then you shit  And tell them  They have to like  Hide from a monster  Yeah the monster in the toilet  The stink monster  You're gonna be a horrible parent  Why  Cause I won't shit in front of them  You're gonna have to sacrifice  You know  Shitting  Yourself  It's not gonna be about you anymore  I don't like when little  Beave comes in the bathroom  Yeah  Really  No  Although he does jump up  On the back of the toilet  And scratch my back  Trying to climb up my back  That's nice  Sitting there  And then he'll  He'll climb into my sweats  If they're around my ankles  Really  And go to sleep 
[03:11:00]  Adorable  That is adorable  It is  No I  My point was this  Like it's more  I hate to say it  But it's more of a  A woman's thing  When you said  All that shit  That has to come  With the baby  Uh huh  All the bags  And the toilet  Right  And  Around everything  And guys  Like if I  Well my son's older now  But when  When he was younger  I would pack  One dumb diaper  Couple wipes  And put it in my back pocket  And that's how I leave the house  With my kid  In your back pocket 
[03:11:30]  That's everything you need  Yeah  That's all I needed  Yeah  How long  I figured anything else  If God forbid anything else  If it's worse than that  I could  Buy it  Buy it or figure it out  Dwayne Reed around  Everywhere  But my wife's  You know  She's like  A lot of the other wives  They have to bring everything  I'm like  We don't need all this  They know how to prepare  Like huge  Like diaper bags  Filled with everything  And it's all  Just in case stuff  I'm like  Just in case  We'll go to Rite Aid  Just in case  But what about some lotion  Opie  All that  They need a little lotion 
[03:12:00]  All that  If their little bottom  Is tender  That's  That's the  That's the women  Yeah  Yeah  I don't even have to take the calls  I guarantee the guys  Are totally related  Saying yeah  One diaper in the back  They just  Yeah  In the back pocket  And you're good to go  One ditey in the back  But what if  You know  Change of clothes  And I'm like  No  I don't need that  Because you also learn  You know  A lot of the stuff  That happens to kids  It bothers you more than them  They don't have a clue  Oh they don't give a shit  That they're fucking  They can sit around  I mean we don't do this 
[03:12:30]  But they can sit around  In a wet diaper  For a whole day  They don't give a fuck  Yeah that'll probably  Give a rash  But to the parent  You're like  Fuck oh my god  We gotta change this  You know  I bet that'll give them a rash though  Yeah you gotta be careful  With the rash shit  That diaper rash  I want to tell  Opie to wait  Till those kids get older  And catch them having sex  Oh no  Oh boy  They catch you having sex  Or you catch them having sex  Well that'd be nice  Which one 
[03:13:00]  What  Huh  You know  Yeah you can't  You can't let them  Catch you having sex  Right  That's fucking atrocious  So you don't jerk off anymore  What  You don't jerk off anymore  Throwing you  All the jacking off  Right  If you can't close the door  You're taking a shit  Where the hell  You're gonna  Spank one out  Always trying to figure out  Shit  Sam  Yeah  You can still get one in  Always gotta figure it out  Okay  Cause sometimes  I pretend I'm shitting 
[03:13:30]  But I'm actually jerking off  Because Jess is a sleeper  No one wants the image  Of you jerking off  He's liquid shitting  Through his dick  Exactly  That's exactly right  Alright  Save your jerking off stories  From the post show  I don't want the image  Of you jerking off  Don't imagine it then  But you gotta  Explain how one  Rosy cheeks get even rosier  While you're coming  Yeah  I get  I start blushing  I bet he gets flushed  He gets a bit flushed  Yeah  He gets a bit flushed  But how does one jerk off 
[03:14:00]  When they have kids  If you can't shit in peace  Yeah  You can figure it out  This gives me no information  The jerk off thing  Seems like a very big deal  Are you guys trying?  No  I mean  We're not like not trying  But we're not like trying trying  Well if you're jerking off  You're really not  Giving that much effort  Wasting them  You're wasting them  You're fucking just wasting  You're either trying or you're not  We're like  But you're not what  Timing out your  Whatever  Right  We're banging  But we're not like trying 
[03:14:30]  Alright  You know what I mean  Like it's not like  Do you pull the goalie or not?  Sometimes do  Sometimes up  You pulled the goalie  So you're trying  Sometimes do  What do we mean pull the goalie?  There's no like  You know protection  Protection in the way  We already have the condom  No condom  No pulling out  No fucking  You're letting it ride  Just letting it  Just letting it fly  Rolling the dice  Fucking firing it right in there  In all its glory  Sometimes not every time  Right  Yeah see this guy knows  I can't take a shit  Without my kids coming into the bathroom 
[03:15:00]  Yeah cause they're fucking curious  Where are you?  So how does he jerk off then?  Huh?  Even the faggot Travis  Wound up getting his wife pregnant  Yeah how do you jerk off?  Dude  Yeah anyone can do it  See you're not using basic log  Logic?  Logic  You're not using basic logic  See you have no choice  When you're gonna shit  Okay oh I see  Ah right  That makes more sense  Just use your dumb head  You can time it out a little 
[03:15:30]  So there's things you absolutely  Could do as soon as they fall asleep  My god yeah  Like jerk off  But I mean  You shit when you shit  Everyone has a pretty regular schedule  More or less  That's the difference  I get it now  Do you ever  Sometimes you have to bring the baby monitor in  When you jerk off though?  Oh  How awful is that?  Just to make sure  Everything's done up and up  You wanna hear that?  Responsible parenting  The era of the shock shock is over  I don't know what you're trying to do  He's trying  He's trying hard 
[03:16:00]  Young upstart  That's cute  We've heard it all  We've said it all  You haven't said that  He's trying  Oh Sam Roberts shock jock  How cute  How cute with your shocking question  What you're about to hear may shock you  Right  Show the VU meters  Know what shocked the hell out of me last night?  Speaking of shock jocks  Did you watch the video of Ron?  Ron Bennington  Oh my god  That Ron did a lot of coke  Wow  He's kinda hinted over the years 
[03:16:30]  I mean he's not shy about it  But yeah  Man you see that video  And you know that guy  Was completely happening  He was doing some lines  Completely in the drug culture  What a kid man  He was a kid  Just a kid  And it's so odd  Because I've always  Can we put the clip on our Facebook page  For the people that haven't seen it yet?  I've always seen Ronnie as like  You know a patriarchal type  Right  Wise man of the world  Kind of a thing  And then to see him as a mullet headed kid 
[03:17:00]  But he's the same Ron  It's the same personality  Yes  Yes  You know  But  It's pretty fucking cool  Yeah  He was part of a news piece about shock jocks  And then what did they say about Fez?  Feigning homosexuality  Did they say that?  Yes  It's like  And Fez Whatley  Fez did look  Here he is feigning homosexuality  Fez did not look as young as Ron did  No Ron looks like he's just out of college  It's unbelievable the difference in Bennington 
[03:17:30]  But  Yeah  Yeah  It was great  I loved watching it  I think  I might have to search out some Ron and Ron clips  Yeah  Some more of that  That's why you guys gotta follow us  Because all this shit goes on  You know after the show's over  Everyone's trading clips  And moving all over the fucking place  So  Oh yeah  It's a good time for a great Twitter plug  Opie Radio  Oh  And Anthony Cumia on Twitter  But  Yes  You know the show never really ends  There's just so much shit going on  And this was the clip that everyone was checking out  Last night  Is this it? 
[03:18:00]  Honey  Because this is not  This looks different  Yeah this is a different news book  Oh cool let's check it out  Okay  Fuck the one we saw last night  If there's another one  Tonight in Campbell's Corner  One of the hottest teams to ever hit the Bay Area's radio waves  Is back on the air  And today our Bill Campbell paid a visit to the dynamic duo of Ron and Ron  It's very productive at that week  Why change?  They're back  Ron and Ron  Broadcasting temporarily from WHPT-FM studios in St. Pete  In a couple of weeks they'll be firmly ensconced at WSUN 
[03:18:30]  Today's kickoff broadcast featured a strangely quashy psychic  Along with regular Fez Watley  Yes he always wears a Fez  The show follows a rather loose  Yes he always wears a Fez  Whatever we say  Whatever people on the phones want to talk about  Hey Ronnie  Or whatever happened overnight  Normally it's their idea though  Right  You know somebody calls up and say I think this will just rock  But tomorrow's show we're going to talk about when you and I used to be neighbors Bill  Earlier this year Ron and Ron were a team at Rival Station but left after a dispute 
[03:19:00]  They've been broadcasting on the syndicated network throughout the southeast for several months  Before joining WSUN  They were the number one radio morning show  GM  He just looks like a GM  That guy just spoiled the clip  Some asshole GM  GM  I don't even know the guy and I guarantee you it was a nightmare for Ron and Ron  Of course  So  That's fucking great  You know I don't know if I ever said that  I think I said it a couple times over the years 
[03:19:30]  But I used to go down to Winter Park, Florida almost every year because I had no money  And that was my vacation to go see my sister  Yeah  So I had a place to fucking crash  I only had to pay for the fucking plane ticket  And then I would you know hit a couple theme parks or whatever  And uh  Year after year  There was about a week there  I would listen to Ron and Ron  Listen to Ron and Ron  And I always thought those guys were really good  I didn't get to hear them on a regular basis  Because they were you know from the south  But yeah  Yeah  And now to see these clips online last night 
[03:20:00]  That was great  Yeah it was uh  Funny to  See that pop up  Very young Mr. Bennington  Alright  What do we got for tomorrow's show  What do we got  I think Bob Kelly's coming in  He hasn't been on in a while  Jimmy's gonna be in LA doing maybe his last Jay Leno appearance  So make sure you watch that  Uh  Tomorrow  Yeah  Is that how that works  Yeah cause he's flying today  Is he gonna be on tonight  How does that work  I don't know  He'll probably be on tonight 
[03:20:30]  Cause  Yeah  Well he'll be back Friday morning  Oh but he takes the red eye  So he'll probably be on tomorrow  He'll be on tomorrow  Kenny's telling me tomorrow  Thanks Kenny  Tomorrow  So make sure you check out Jimmy on Jay Leno  Cause it could be his last appearance  That sucks  You uh  Until Jay Leno pops up somewhere else  Yeah  Which obviously he will  He's not ready to fucking retire  What is he gonna do  You listen to 1010 Winds right  Yeah  Did you hear the commercials for Bridges and Madison County  I'm rolling  I don't know how that happened  We talked about this out of nowhere  And then it's  It's so weird how this shit happens  I guess when you're in tune with the universe 
[03:21:00]  Yeah  That's what it is  Yeah I heard it yesterday  And I just  I can't help but just think  Ugh  How awful that's gotta be  Never go and see that  Yeah  Yeah it was kind of funny to hear though  I'm gonna walk down the hall  What do you say  We just get the fuck  I think Jerry Springer  Is gonna be here tomorrow too  Oh good  Oh Springer  Oh we gotta  We gotta tell him how much we like Search  Yeah  Search  There's a little competition  Search is ripping off Jerry Springer  But trying to make it look like he's not  Well he cares  More than Jerry does  Ah Jerry Carey  And Jerry does 
[03:21:30]  At the end of his show  Um  He does his final thought  Right  And Search does  Search is 60  Right  Yeah  Alright  Send a game people  Oh and thanks to Dr. Ian Smith  He gave us a really fun segment today  Yes he did  Without a doubt  That fucking E-Rock  And I'm gonna go try his popcorn  Oh  And he better send me a blender  Before I start promoting the blender  He did say  He was gonna send us all blenders  These blenders rule  These new blenders  Are the shit 
[03:22:00]  They're so much easier to clean and use  Uh  What's up Roland  Oh Rolly  What  I got a free hat from Who Kid  Yeah I'm gonna say  Topic number one  On today's post show  Roland is wearing a hat  That says  Swagger advisory  From Who Kid  Yeah  The hat looks cool  But I can't  I can't walk around  With swagger advisory  Of course you can  And I need a new winter hat too  Man  It's Flat Fitty  Flat Fitty fam  Flat Fitty  That's the brand that sponsored Who Kid 
[03:22:30]  They'll be happy you did that  Nice  I'm sure Who Kid will be on the post show  He'll be on the post show today  After show  Whatever it's called  Post show  Very cool  And then don't forget people  The show replays starting right at 11 o'clock  That's right  Right to the meat of the show  What's that supposed to mean?
