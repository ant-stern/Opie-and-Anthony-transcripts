<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a detailed and mocking recap of a celebrity boxing match featuring Barry Williams, Danny Bonaduce, Vanilla Ice, and Tonya Harding – all previous show guests.  The hosts extensively ridiculed Williams' performance.  They also discussed a rival morning show, "The Other Side," whose hosts wore thongs on air, and Bonaduce's past arrest for allegedly assaulting a transvestite.

The show then unexpectedly premiered a new Korn song, "Here to Stay," obtained early from the internet.  The hosts played it repeatedly, gleefully anticipating the outrage of other radio stations. This led to a frustrated phone call from a listener, Don, complaining about the song being interrupted.

A highly contentious phone call with a listener named "Money" followed, characterized by vulgar insults and accusations exchanged between the hosts and the caller, focusing on the caller's perceived hypocrisy in criticizing the show's vulgarity while continuing to listen.  The hosts repeatedly challenged "Money" to visit the studio.  Further discussion included the numerous changes in the lineup of a local New York morning sports show, the NCAA basketball tournament, and the hosts’ reaction to a local radio station labeling them the "most offensive show in local radio history." The segment ended with more listener calls, a mention of upcoming guest Colin Quinn, and a darkly humorous bit about a bedwetting commercial, “Sleep-Drys.”

The next segment started with more riffing on the “Sleep-Drys” commercial, featuring inappropriate jokes about child murder and the Andrea Yates case. The hosts then discussed their lack of major advertisers, speculating on the reasons behind this.  A listener, Leslie, called to complain about the excessive playing of "Corn" (a likely mishearing of "Korn"), prompting the hosts to reveal they’d received a cease and desist letter from Sony Music.  A caller named Walter then described a bizarre sexual fetish involving women laughing at him while he masturbated.  Leslie was encouraged to engage in a sexually suggestive exchange with Walter.  Comedian Colin Quinn then called in, discussing his new TV show and its edgy content.  The conversation returned to the celebrity boxing match, focusing on its brutality and Bonaduce’s anger management.  Further calls included another man sharing Walter’s fetish.  The segment concluded with a call from Dr. Whitehead, a penis surgeon, who discussed his procedures, including the use of cadaver skin in penis enlargement surgery, leading to a humorous and explicit discussion about the procedure’s details.


The third segment opened with more discussion of Dr. Whitehead's penis enlargement procedures, including sexually explicit jokes and increasingly inappropriate questions from the hosts and callers.  The doctor attempted to maintain professionalism amidst the vulgarity. The conversation also covered his website, resulting in a traffic surge. The show then shifted to a rivalry with K-Rock, playing offensive songs by a musician named Q (including a St. Patrick's Day song rife with racial slurs and homophobic remarks), and numerous "F.U." messages from listeners.  A caller repeatedly introduced himself as "Garrett Stinky," and a California listener praised the show.  Topics also included AM radio, a debate about the band Yes, and a song about escaping a menstruating wife at the pub.  Paul Mercurio, an Emmy Award-winning actor, was briefly mentioned as a studio guest. The segment concluded with the hosts preparing for a party.

A final, shorter segment promoted a new website, overthelimit.com, described as similar to Maxim but "funnier" and "more disgusting," noting the presence of teenage girls.  The hosts expressed antagonism towards a previous associate ("message boy").  No specific guests were mentioned in this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi. You said you were going to come down, but what's that? To the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. 
[00:00:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. Hello. How are you guys doing? We're doing all right, Tom. Thanks for asking. My bad.  You're a big rock star now. Hi. It's Garrett Stinky.  I can be until I pass out. Hi. 
[00:01:00]  Hi. Hi. Let's just stick with me. That's what I'm trying. Let's stick around.  Hi. Ooh, you, I ain't calling you, lady. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.  Hey. A couple phone numbers in the New York area. 877-692-1027.  877-692-1027. Anywhere else. Including... 
[00:01:30]  I don't know. I don't think what you're going to say. Let me think.  All right. Go ahead.  Columbus!  Wow. I didn't have that.  Out of nowhere.  What's up, Big Wazoo?  The Big Wazoo.  The second most embarrassing station that we're on. The Big Wazoo.  Now, it might be a cool place. It's just, you know, the Big Wazoo.  It's the Big Wazoo.  We're on a station called The Juice in Austin.  The Jews?  Juice. 
[00:02:00]  Oh.  Juice.  Wondering how we would have been on that station.  And the most embarrassing station you could hear us on? The Fun House.  I thought it was WNEW here in New York, our flagship station of the OPNX.  Well, that's the flagship station.  This is the flagship station in New York.  How many torpedoes are in its hull?  Flagship. Flagship.  It should be a T instead of a P.  Right.  The flagship.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  The flag station.  All right. So, if you're in Columbus or anywhere else outside of New York and you're hearing our voices right now,  you can call us at 866-277-4...  Wow.  Hooray for AIDS!  Yes.  What?  Hey, is Barry Williams calling us?  I sure hope so.  Boy, if anybody watched the Fox night of celebrity boxing last night,  of course it was our friend of the show, Barry Williams, Greg Brady, against... 
[00:03:00]  All our friends of the show lost last night.  Against Danny Bonaduce.  Barry Williams lost to Danny Bonaduce.  Yep.  Vanilla Ice?  Poo-ha!  Oh, my God.  Vanilla Ice.  Biggest poo-ha!  Vanilla Ice got creamed by Willis from different strokes.  We had Vanilla Ice in here.  It looks pretty intimidating.  He can't fight.  Stinky was all upset.  We were watching in the office just laughing our asses off.  And I was like, Stinky, there's your man who signed the wall at Club Stinky.  And he's getting his ass beat. 
[00:03:30]  He was punching.  It was so funny.  He's punching like he's trying to block his face and punch at the same time.  Like, his punches came straight out from his face.  And meanwhile, Willis there is doing these roundhouse...  He learned a thing or two in the joint.  Oh, my God.  It was like they were fighting over a cigarette.  Yeah.  In prison.  It was great.  And then, of course, Tanya Harding, the hosebag skater.  And Paula Jones.  And Paula Jones.  We've had Paula Jones on the show as well. 
[00:04:00]  Mm-hmm.  And she had to walk away from her fight.  That one...  Tanya hit her with one right and she went right down.  Right down.  And I would think, you know, she could take it on the chin with Clinton's yam bag smacking  against it so many times.  You'd think she wouldn't have a weak chin like that.  But a glass chin.  Very weak chin.  But Barry Williams, quite frankly, embarrassed himself and embarrassed the Opie and Anthony show.  He was...  He got knocked out. 
[00:04:30]  I don't want to be associated with anyone like that, man.  Opie, aren't you talking about before the fight?  You know.  He got knocked down so many times last night.  He didn't even get up.  Every time.  Every time they got together and punches were thrown, Barry would hit the canvas.  I have to ask him if he was getting paid per times he got knocked down.  Well, it was for his charity.  Maybe that was it.  Maybe he was making extra money every time he hit the canvas.  Because, now, Danny Bonaduce can fight. 
[00:05:00]  Like, he's a martial arts guy.  And he kind of proved it.  The guy would swing with these right hands and connect on the side of Barry Williams' head.  And Barry Williams would just go down.  And then he gets up.  The last one was devastating in the second round.  Hit right smack on the ear with a right hook from Danny Bonaduce.  Barry Williams goes down.  You just see a white towel fly out from his corner.  And now he's there.  It's over.  It's over.  He couldn't even get up.  He went to try to get up and his legs just went. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Speaking of Danny Bonaduce, I saw the sickest thing on TV this morning.  What?  I took a peek at that show, The Other Side or whatever it's called.  Oh, the male version of The View?  Right.  With Dick Clark.  Yeah, yeah.  Danny Bonaduce.  The dude from what?  Saved by the Bell.  Greg Luganis.  The Greg Luganis guy.  The Greg Luganis guy.  Good one, Rick.  They're sitting there, and I guess they decided, I don't watch the show enough.  I'll take a peek every once in a while for a couple minutes here, a couple minutes there, 
[00:06:00]  when I'm, you know, flicking around.  Sure.  They were wearing thongs today, Anthony, so they could relate to their female audience.  Was Dick Clark in a thong?  Yes.  And what else were they wearing besides thongs?  But then Dick Clark had to make sure everyone knew that it wasn't a female thong.  What's the effing difference?  They were wearing ball bags.  They were wearing basically what women wear, the thongs.  Oh, my God.  But I guess they were able to find the male version so it doesn't sound too gay. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  Can you imagine you and I deciding to relate to the female audience?  Oh, let's get in thongs.  Sitting here in our thongs?  I know on one episode...  How bad do you need to be on TV?  They all dressed up like the girls from The View.  They did that one, too.  Ugh.  I don't know what's going on over there.  And considering Danny's, uh...  He kind of has an attraction to transvestites.  The guy, what was he, busted? 
[00:07:00]  For, uh...  Beating up a tranny.  Yeah, he was beating up a tranny.  Because he didn't know.  Yeah.  Okay.  Who doesn't know?  Except Norton and Danny.  Dude, I did a gig with Danny Bonaduce years ago.  Did you?  Because he was doing stand-up and he wanted nothing to do with me.  I'm like, dude, I got a tranny, too.  I told him the story about the big back.  He was like, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh.  Get away from me.  Get away from me.  Shut up.  Get away from me.  Get away from me.  That's funny.  All right.  I mean, we'll talk about the fight thing.  Yeah.  When Barry calls.  Rick, we're going to get Barry on, right?  I'm hoping that people aren't calling me back today. 
[00:07:30]  Maybe he's embarrassing.  Oh, come on.  Yeah, come on, Barry.  Barry, you've got to take your abuse if you're a friend of the show.  He looks like a rag doll.  He got knocked her ever.  And then we've got to give props to the job.  I did not see the job last night, Andy.  Yes.  Yes.  I have it on tape.  I was at the Islander game last night.  Yes, you are.  So I missed the job.  So you're going to have to give me your coffee.  Have that work out for you.  Well, 3-2 loss for the Islanders.  Ouch.  Cheryl.  Hi, guys. 
[00:08:00]  What's up?  Hello.  The job was the funniest hit last night.  Was it?  Didn't you know beforehand when you did a tarot card reading?  Call me now.  You know, they just found out that that, what's her name there?  Miss Cleo?  Yeah.  Miss Cleo.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep.  Yeah.  She, they found her birth certificate.  She was born in California, and her parents are from Texas and California.  I told you she was from Jamaica.  I am from Jamaica. 
[00:08:30]  I am a shaman.  Yeah.  No, seriously, guys.  The job was very funny last night.  Yep.  Well, you know, we told you guys that.  It was extremely funny.  I laughed until my tummy hurts.  I know.  We have a clip of you watching it last night.  Yeah.  Jay, listen to you laughing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, guys, you've got to get your friend on the phone.  What's his name?  Adam Farrar.  Adam.  Right.  And ask him about that girlfriend that he has, because she's one crazy mother effer. 
[00:09:00]  Yes.  Yeah, we didn't see the job, because we were all busy last night.  Well, watch it today, and you'll see what I'm talking about.  But we, you know, we taped it.  We're going to check it out later.  Cool.  Okay, bye.  A lot of people call and saying that the job, funniest job yet, blah, blah, blah.  That's what Dennis Leary was saying yesterday.  Cool.  All right, Ant.  Well, I think we're time.  I think it's time.  Yes, it's time.  We're going to break out a new bit today. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, what's this one called?  It's called, um, make fun of all the radio stations out there that think they are cool.  Actually, is it more make fun of or piss off all the radio stations out there that think they're cool?  Eh, let's play, uh, piss off all the radio stations out there that think they are cool.  Brand new feature on the Opie and Anthony show.  We could also subtitle it for, uh, Just New York.  We could call it, uh, do something until the, uh, Abercrombie and Fitch Midget program director throws his gold records through the wall. 
[00:10:00]  I believe this will be the third gold record he breaks over our show, Anthony.  Listen closely.  You could hear it, Smash.  This is great.  Uh, what we have planned here, quickly, is, um, it's something that really gets under station's skin.  When all they have to brag about is, uh, the fact they play music.  Music.  And, of course, uh, playing it first.  Playing it first.  That's a huge thing with radio stations. 
[00:10:30]  You've heard it.  You've heard the rock stations crowing how they, they play something first.  And, for some reason, that's a big thing with the music stations.  And, uh, if, if they get scooped by another station, you cannot even understand behind the scenes how much crap and anger and phone calls and, and, and just brutality that goes on at the stations  that aren't the ones that get it first.  Stopping.  Right.  Dave Dickless at AF.  Ha, ha.  Yep. 
[00:11:00]  Ha, ha.  Oh.  We do this now.  Now we do this now.  We do this now.  Well, we got our hands on something.  Oh, yeah, we got our friends, too, in, uh, high places.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  We got our hands on something.  So, uh, we're going to do a, uh, world premiere here.  World premiere, and this friggin' rocks.  I think when you're on, uh, 18 radio stations across America, you could call this a world premiere.  Yeah.  It's a world premiere, all the other radio stations, uh, just, just dying to play what 
[00:11:30]  we're about to play, Anthony.  We're playing it about three months early.  Three months early.  Lock the door, Rick.  Yeah.  Don't answer any phones around here.  Because there are also other things that happen when you do this.  Not only radio stations you piss off, but record people.  That's right.  And, uh, because they don't want this out.  So, uh.  But screw it.  This, this, this rocks, man.  We listened to this earlier.  You know what, Ed?  Paul. 
[00:12:00]  I think I, uh, I'll give, uh, the people a few more minutes, a few more seconds here,  so they can tape it.  Oh, okay.  So then they can play it whenever they want, instead of waiting for their cool station to  play it.  They're going to be so, so angry over there.  Stephanie from New Jersey.  Stephanie, Stephanie from Jersey.  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  Stephanie, how much does it rock?  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  So, are you ready to play, uh, piss off all the stations out there that think they're 
[00:12:30]  cool?  That think they're cool.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show brings you the world premiere of the new song from Korn.  Right.  A song called Here to Stay.  Here to Stay.  Album Untouchables out June 11th.  June 11th.  We got this off the internet.  Yeah, listen to this.  Korn, Here to Stay, crank it. 
[00:13:00]  Ah, you're checking out the latest from Korn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow.  A song called Here to Stay from the forthcoming album Untouchables out June 11th.  That's like a world exclusive, Anthony.  I like that, man.  Goddamn.  That's just, that's another one I'm going to get in trouble driving to.  He rocks.  What do you think, Norton?  It's no Ozzy, right?  Although I did see the only time I saw Korn perform was opening for Ozzy.  Right.  I did. 
[00:13:30]  There you go.  We're back in the music business, Anthony.  That's what we do now.  Yeah.  All right.  We should take our first break, huh?  All right.  Lots of dude at American Motorcycle.  Stopping by.  Got his new show, which we saw, and it was very funny.  Yes.  Penis surgeon calling in.  Penis surgeon?  Yep.  Make sure there's Schwantz bigger and longer.  Hey, how about that?  I don't know why anyone would ever want that done, but...  Yeah, don't touch it. 
[00:14:00]  Don't even look at it.  We'll talk to him a little bit.  Scott Farrell calling in.  The solo Scott Farrell.  Yeah, he's our morning guy here in New York, and he lost his partner this week.  Playing a great guy, man.  Has decided to team back up with Rocky.  How long could you take being next to Farrell?  Yeah.  Is that what chased him away?  I don't know.  No, I guess he got a good offer to go join back up with Rocky.  He's going to Detroit, man.  Is that what it is?  Going to Detroit?  Yep.  Detroit.  So now our buddy Scott Farrell is solo in the mornings here in New York, so we'll catch 
[00:14:30]  up with him as well, and hopefully Barry Williams calling in.  I don't know if he wants to show his face today, but we're trying to get him on the phone.  Yeah.  All right?  And more of your phone calls in New York, 877-692-1027.  We'll play it again in a little bit.  Opie Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Honduras.  Evan Honduras.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:15:00]  Hey.  Scott Farrell checking in in a minute here.  Don's pissed off at us.  Don, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Opie, what are you doing?  I was all psyched.  I heard like, oh my God, I can't believe they're actually going to play some cool new track  from Korn no one's ever heard before.  I got my Esflin cooked up.  About to rip an MP3 out of my Mac here.  Flip the switch.  Right before the song kicks in, Opie goes, Opie and Anthony, ruining the MP3 for everybody.  Thank you very much, you tool.  Opie, why'd you do that?  Yeah, play it again, man, would you?  Because I'll tell you what happens. 
[00:15:30]  We just had the world premiere on our show of the new Korn song, Here to Stay At, three  months ahead of time.  And what happens is, other stations will tape it off our show and play it on their station.  Hey, you guys got off the net, though, right?  And then they'll act like they're the cool ones.  Yeah, we got it off the internet.  Well, we should be able to find it out there somewhere, too, right?  So everyone else is going to be able to find it.  So why just go and wreck it for everyone that was listening to your show?  I don't think you're smart enough to find it.  All right, man.  We're good like that.  We know where to look.  All right, hey, Norton rules. 
[00:16:00]  You guys suck.  Thank you, sir.  Maybe we should just do it again so we can get a clean copy of it.  Yeah?  What do you think?  All right, but as long as you guys know, there's going to be other stations taping it now.  Well, I'm just thinking we better do it now.  And then they'll have their local cool DJ go, look what I got.  Look what I found.  We really should do it right now if we're going to do it.  Right now?  Why?  Because I'm hearing things.  I don't see any delivery service here yet.  I don't either, but I'm hearing things.  Well, did someone already take it out of here? 
[00:16:30]  That's what happens.  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  It dissolved.  All right.  This time I'll just be really, really quiet.  Okay, Anthony?  Don't say anything.  Don't say anything, but just realize that other stations are going to now tape the new  Korn single.  Right.  That you're hearing first on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  In 18 cities.  Remember, this is the world premiere.  Exactly.  The world premiere of the new song from Korn, Here to Stay.  All right?  Now I'm going to shut up and just play it. 
[00:17:00]  But remember, you're hearing it on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Okay.  One more time.  Can I just say O.P. and Anthony like halfway to the song, really?  No.  You're ruining it.  We need to tag it, though.  Why?  You know these scumbags at the other stations.  Who cares?  We know the deal.  All right.  Here it is.  Once again, Korn.  Their album doesn't come out for like three months.  You cannot even understand how much this is pissing off people that we love pissing off.  So you've got to bear with us.  Right.  Enjoy it.  We know things are getting smashed right now. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  They like to pretend they're the cool guys.  Mm-hmm.  That they're cool.  Korn here to stay.  Eat a bullet.  Dude, you effed it up, man.  Man, you screwed it up.  God damn.  Stop.  Norton yells, eat a bullet.  You suck.  There's guys all over the place, all over the world, because we're on the internet through  the New Orleans station that are hearing this for the first time.  No eat a bullet stuff.  Oh, come on.  They want a clean copy of this.  You're right.  I apologize.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  Can I start it now?  Yeah.  Once again, the world premiere of the new Korn song, Here to Stay.  Town Hall.  All right.  You know, Norton, what's your problem?  You have to turn your goddamn mic off.  What is wrong with you?  Town Hall.  No one wants your Town Hall at the beginning of the new song from Korn, Here to Stay.  You suck.  April 18th, Ticket Through Ticketmaster, you C.S.  Can I play the song? 
[00:18:30]  Come on, man.  Because they're running a package down to us as we speak.  All right.  Here's the brand new one from Korn.  Please tape it.  Yeah.  Here to stay.  Ozzy rules.  Stop.  And I'm turning his mic off.  He cannot be trusted today.  Please do that.  There you go.  You're gone.  Here it is.  There you have it.  Now you've got a clean copy. 
[00:19:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show with the world premiere of the new song from Korn, Here to Stay.  From the forthcoming album, that doesn't mean their fourth album, you fools.  How many dickhead douchebags were writing in that you know who you are and saying,  Dude, it's their fifth album, not their fourth idiot.  It's forthcoming.  Forthcoming, meaning it is to come.  Forthcoming album, you stupid ass.  It's going to be called Untouchables.  It's out June 11th. 
[00:19:30]  Go ahead.  Turn all red and feel like a douchebag.  We'll wait.  Jeez, man.  There you go, Anthony.  There you go.  That's what we do.  Right here on the rock.  Up to your cup of tea.  Let's go to Bill.  Bill, you're on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right, Bill.  I just called up AF and asked them if they heard the new corn sign.  Yeah.  The guy said no.  And I said, well, I just heard it first on Opie and Anthony.  Hey. 
[00:20:00]  And then he told me to AF off and hung up on me.  AF off.  Well, right about now, their production department is taking what we just played on the air.  They're going to cut it up all nice, and they'll get it on the air for you now.  Because now they're in a state of panic.  AF off.  Screw you.  Dave, what do we do?  But, Dave, that's all I got is music.  Why couldn't I say, hey, Dave, I broke into Dave's office.  Dave, if they trumped me on the music, what else do I have? 
[00:20:30]  You think they'll say that they were the ones to play at second?  No, they'll lie to you guys like they always do.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Bill.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Have you heard the new corn song?  No, we haven't.  Well, I just did.  Good.  That's hilarious.  I don't even know if he's still here.  Scott Farrell.  Hey, I remember that McFarland dude, Spawn, did their freak on a Pharrella leash.  And those dudes are freaks, and you've got to just love them. 
[00:21:00]  They're hardcore.  They're out to just, like, completely shred people's lives.  You've got to love that.  That is sweet.  You guys are evil as you.  I think it sounds good.  You've got to love corn, right, Scott?  Well, I need some corn after all the changes lately.  It seems like the seasons are blowing through, and the harvest is coming upon us.  Farrell, what happened?  Now, you're solo?  You've got to dig it, though, because I always thought playing was really cool.  And then one day I looked at him, and I said, I'm going to punch you.  And then after I punched him a few times, I said, when are you moving home to Detroit to hang with your sissy friend Rocky? 
[00:21:30]  And he said, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then I saw him the day he had the class.  He was a cool dude.  I think he's funny.  I like working with him.  But he said, man, I'm going to go take the long-term deal.  And I said, you're the man.  Go taste it.  I said, you want me to live with your wife and kids?  No, they're cool, man.  I think it's a great gig for him.  I think Blaine's really one of the coolest dudes I've met because, obviously, for them, it sucked to have some dude like me,  this extreme scotch-drinking, freak, loudmouthed, idiot, show up and just, like, blow into town, like, you know, 
[00:22:00]  Bon Jovi doing a tour out in East Rutherford with all the freaks that come out of the woodwork.  And they were like, whatever, I don't need this.  And the one dude bailed, and Blaine...  I'm trying to talk to two.  He stuck out, that dude.  But, see, I'm going to try to talk to two now.  I think he's cool, man.  I just raged.  Today we took 350 calls.  I had a blast.  I got a big old 50.  Pharrell.  Yeah.  Pharrell, I want to congratulate you.  But we've got to explain this to the rest of the country.  Here in New York, we've been trying to do something called the Sports Guys concept. 
[00:22:30]  The Sports Guys concept here in New York has had more lineup changes than Minuto.  Yeah, and that's literally now, not even like a joke.  It's the morning show here at the station in New York.  It's been called Sports Guys for well over a year now.  It's just always blown.  And we've had...  I mean, we could probably figure it out, but at least ten different combinations of us sports guys, okay?  Uh-huh.  Pharrell, I think the concept is finally over.  Dude, I didn't think that it was, like, maybe one of those deals where, you know, they wash their hands. 
[00:23:00]  All I know is that, you know, it always sucked.  For whatever reason, it just has this bad string of luck with constant, just, like, rapid, like, you know, Vietnam-type activity.  You go to bed, you're like, have a nap, brother.  Bitch, run for the hills.  Run for the hills.  And all I know is that when I came, I just wanted to...  I wanted to do what no one had done.  And I wanted to take it on head-on.  And I wanted to piss people off.  And the writers hate me.  And all of the sissies that run radio. 
[00:23:30]  And these dentists that run stupid websites.  I'd like to beat that dude in the head with a sledgehammer.  You're, uh, apparently, uh, you're talking about the, uh, New York Radio Message Board.  I can't stand the people that...  Can you imagine sitting around all day, like, completely whacked and, like, thinking that it mattered to, like, go constantly, 24-7 about this stuff.  And, like, delve into...  Like, they write about you guys like you would rob banks for a little...  Pharrell?  Well, this is The God's Honest Truth.  I stopped reading that thing well over a year ago because I realized it's a bunch of guys that have no effing idea how radio works. 
[00:24:00]  Well, dude, it's like this.  Here's what...  That is run by a guy that has gotten so many things wrong when it comes...  He's a dick.  When it comes to our, our program, it's ridiculous.  He gives people cavities.  He's fondling candy stripers.  I can't stand him.  He thinks he's, like, some kind of, like, uh, informative god.  Dude, go write, like, novels with, like, you know, uh, love novels and everything.  So that everybody can think you're so passionate about something.  Go drill a tooth.  All I know is that, uh...  Just explain... 
[00:24:30]  If it wasn't for you dudes, it wouldn't have worked.  Hold on, hold on.  Just explain to the rest of the country.  Uh, this is how pathetic radio is in New York.  There's a guy that's really a dentist that runs this message board.  It's for radio...  It's supposed to be for radio insiders.  I'm gonna beat his head in.  And he thinks he knows more about radio than the guys that are doing radio.  He does predictions, like it's a NASCAR race, of people's lives and careers.  Let me tell you, he's made many predictions about, uh, the Opie and Anthony show.  He's never nailed one.  Dude, he writes so many things bad about me. 
[00:25:00]  He would have thought I, uh, you know, I was passing out roofies and chasing kids home  from school and trade and spit with...  I've walked out of meetings with very important people in this company that have spoken to  me and told me things.  And I have told them things.  And then, uh, I would read the New York radio message board.  And there's Alan, uh, writing his prediction of what he thinks is happening.  And it is exactly the opposite of what I was told by, uh, people like, oh, Mel Karmazin. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, you gotta be psychotic to read it.  I mean, you guys had more fun saying, like, I'd blow up by April 4th.  And then the other day when all that stuff went down, I was like, god damn, man, maybe  I will blow up.  I was like, I don't even think I'm gonna make April 4th.  Well, my over-under with you is...  I thought that's what Blaine was.  Maybe I am.  Maybe I'm like, you know, I'm Rob Zombie, man, but I'm done on games.  I got chicks coming over.  We're causing trouble.  I think it's gonna work.  Because of you dudes, uh, they've flushed it.  And I got hardcore on A, like, peasants that run free with it. 
[00:26:00]  I'm nuts doing it.  So it's not called, uh, Sports Guys, right?  No, it's just Pharrell.  It's just Pharrell.  So no more...  Sports Guys!  Good.  Sports Guys!  Like, uh, like I said, today was, like, the most erotic day I've had doing radio in a long  time.  And it was not because the dude wasn't there.  It was because I just gave New York what they wanted.  I gave them the stage.  Everybody went off.  Everybody gets their, you know, dose.  And did you get our little present?  Oh, you guys are evil.  Why?  At that 1780, I'm sucking out a couple of crackers right now. 
[00:26:30]  Scott Rocks!  I love that.  Now listen, I'm taking games.  I got my final four here for you.  You want to know?  Uh, yeah.  I'm not really following the...  Nice.  Anyway, I think it all sucks because what happens is they try to promote these upsets.  They're like, you can see the highlights.  That's all they ever do is show the greatest upsets of all time.  And then what happens is, is that in the end, only the heavyweights remain.  Just like in the NFL.  The Super Bowl, it's always the best team that wins, even if they get there crooked, like  Patriots.  And then in the NHL, Hatsik and these Red Wings. 
[00:27:00]  And then in the NBA, Shaq Diesel, because he's a Hooper hyper.  And in the NCAAs, I think it's going to be Duke against UConn.  And I think Duke will pepper spray them by 25.  And I think the final four will be UConn against Oregon.  And I think Oklahoma against Duke.  Oklahoma will play Missouri, not Cincinnati, for the Western crown in San Jose.  What about Gonzaga?  Duke will meet Cal in the South.  What about Gonzaga?  Gonzaga's going to get recklessly torqued.  Yeah.  I think they're going to lose to Arizona in the second round.  All right.  Arizona's going to lose to Oklahoma. 
[00:27:30]  There's going to be a lot of conference matchups.  Like that Missouri-Oklahoma region in San Jose.  Those dudes are, you know, they see each other twice a year.  And, I mean, I just think the Big 12, in the end, it's going to be just great teams.  No upset teams.  No Cinderella's.  Right on, bro.  All right.  We just want to say hi to you.  You guys are cool, man.  Good luck to you.  Stay healthy.  Best of luck.  Doing the solo thing in the morning.  You think I'll survive?  Well, my over-under is April 4th still.  That you're going to blame me.  You guys placed the bot GX on me.  I'm over here chewing nails. 
[00:28:00]  You chased the one guy out that was keeping you sane, so now you're on the fast track,  my friend.  I just tell him, I say, I want to explode with it and have fun.  We'll see where the chips land.  Right.  Be cool.  All right.  There goes Scott Pharrell.  There he goes.  Wow.  I need a nap.  Money.  Yes.  What's your problem?  I just wanted to tell you that I think your shell is muddy, dirty, and you're pigged.  Are you married?  Are we married? 
[00:28:30]  First of all, are you a man or a woman?  I'm a woman, except I have a cold meningitis right now.  Uh-huh.  And you want to know if we're married?  Yeah.  No, we're not.  Why?  No.  Oh, is that why you have all the filth to make women like pigs all the time?  Make women like pigs.  Make women like pigs.  What does that mean?  We don't force women to do anything on our show.  No, you advertise it.  What do you mean we advertise it?  You advertise.  You advertise everything you do is filth, filth, filth. 
[00:29:00]  Filth, filth, filth.  Is there any room for decent women out there?  Hey, hey, hey, bitch twat.  What's your problem, and who gives a crap if we're a filthy show?  Don't listen.  Oh, I don't listen.  No, yes, you do.  Stop lying, you ignorant baboon.  You listen.  That's the only reason you know.  That's the only reason you know or think you know the content of this program.  Now, don't listen.  Just because, you know why?  Because I have a husband that puts it on.  Oh, shut up. 
[00:29:30]  And he's like, you know, I've been married for 38 years.  Shut up.  You're probably just a guy trying to get air time.  Oh, you think so?  Yeah, you don't even sound like a woman.  No, honey, I'm 55 years old.  You don't even sound like a woman.  You goddamn battered, disgusting mess you probably are.  You've been married for 38 years?  Oh, you haven't seen me, honey.  You've been married for 38 years.  If you've seen me, what's your point?  Your eyes would pop out.  Yeah, no crap.  I'm sure they would.  Yeah.  Why are you attractive?  They'd pop out because I'd be trying to pull them out of my head. 
[00:30:00]  That's right, because you know why?  You couldn't take it.  Because I got it all over these 20-year-old girls.  Is this Martha's mother?  Money, stop fooling yourself.  Take all your clothes off and look at yourself in the mirror.  Oh, I have.  We're not going to fall for you.  You've been married?  I don't think a 40 D, 28 waist, and a 36 hip.  Oh, shut up.  40 D?  Shut up.  40 D means you have a big back.  I wasn't born yesterday.  Disgusting linebacker. 
[00:30:30]  Which means you probably had male junk that was removed.  Oh, no, no, no.  It's a title.  What's your problem?  Listen, are you trying to sound all sexy and stuff, yet you say our show is disgusting?  Disgusting?  That's all you do is down women and winter cloths.  Yeah, that's what we do every day.  You're right.  You're right.  What can we say?  Hey, Money.  I mean, I'm not the first caller to ever tell you this.  Hey, Money.  Where do you live?  In Monroe.  What?  Monroe.  Monroe where?  Connecticut.  Yeah.  Come down to the station, take your clothes off so we can openly laugh at you. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, I would do it, but you know what?  And I will put a meter on my junk and prove that there will be no movement whatsoever.  You're a slob.  I guarantee you're a slob.  You see what I'm talking about?  Without a bra, those 40 Ds probably hit the floor.  Who are you kidding?  Oh, you think so?  Your half-assed, bullcrap morality.  Go away.  Just die.  Would you throw yourself in front of a bus?  40 Ds, that's not bad.  Kill yourself and make the world a better place. 
[00:31:30]  I think you should throw your one.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, shut up.  You should come in front of a truck.  Oh, shut up.  That's a hell of a comeback there, Money.  Ass.  Woo!  You see what I'm saying?  You don't, man.  Anything else?  She's our pig.  Give me your address.  I'll send a shotgun to your house so your husband can put his mouth over the barrel.  Yeah?  Pull the trigger with his toe and be rid of you.  You know what sucks, Anthony?  There's a girl on the line that agrees with money.  You are disgusting.  Lindsay.  Yeah, I don't agree with her.  I want to talk to the fat slob. 
[00:32:00]  Go ahead, man.  I don't think it's a size 9 and 10.  She doesn't like it.  We were listening to Martha the other day, me and my girl Brandy down here in Philly,  and we were making fun of her.  She's one of these people's problems.  I'm so tired of it.  Girls that come down here want to come down here and have a good time.  And you know what?  Turn off the stupid radio.  If you don't want to hear their crap, then turn it the hell up.  Oh, you guys are so offensive.  And put me next to a 20-year-old girl.  Yeah.  You wouldn't be laughing.  Oh, yeah, we'd be crying. 
[00:32:30]  Money, you should.  No, no, no, no, no.  Money, you fat wench.  Come down here.  You have nothing better to do than sit around in your ass and call the radio station?  Money.  Money.  Delusional mess.  I wonder if we've got a little whore on the phone now.  Sure?  Yeah, of course.  Little whores would like to get down on it.  You've got nothing better to do with your life.  Listen how bitter this piece of crap sounds.  She sounds so bitter.  There's nothing better to do with your life.  You know what happens, Money?  Money, you want to be an attractive girl, and you want to come down here and do it, but 
[00:33:00]  you're a friggin' mess, so you've got to bash everyone that does.  You're a mess, Money.  Jump out a window, put a gun to your head, overdose on drugs, get in the bathtub with a  blender, do something to make the world a better place, and kill yourself.  Too bad you can't get young women.  Shut up!  Too bad you can't get young women.  My girlfriend's 10 years old.  Shut up!  And mine will be.  You want?  And I just got caught writing a letter to Dear Abby.  You need to call a psychiatrist. 
[00:33:30]  And I'm not explaining.  You need a psychiatrist.  Use your intelligence on that one.  Pick up a paper and read Dear Abby if you want in on the joke.  Money, Money.  That's all you do is open up your legs.  Money, call up tomorrow and tell us that you killed yourself.  Money.  What?  Money, I'm going to call you out.  You get your fat, slobby ass down here.  Oh, 9 in 10 is fat and slobby?  And we will line up the 20-year-olds, and we'll see which we like best. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, of course you're going to know what you're called, but you think that women...  How much do you weigh, Money?  126.  And how tall are you?  5'4".  Yeah, and your meat flu is hanging like a radiator hose.  Oh, no, it's not.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, no, it's not.  Stop it.  Just stop.  Well, I would love you to see me and see me at 55 years old.  Do you have any pictures of yourself on the computer?  What?  Do you have a picture of yourself on the computer that you can email?  No, I don't.  Money, let's try to understand you.  What is your effing problem? 
[00:34:30]  What your effing problem is...  Your husband likes the show, and it pisses you off, right?  No, it's because you're at two o'clock.  That's all you do is advertise.  Oh, it's not all we do.  And then all you do is...  Money, shut up, Money.  She hears hot girls on this show, and she ain't one, and it pisses her off.  That's it, Money.  That's it.  You have the problem.  Money, let me explain something to you.  If you don't like this show, we say it all the time, then don't listen.  I don't listen to it.  Don't try to figure out what should be on the radio for everyone else. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, you senior citizen bag of meat.  If you don't like it, whatever, but there are plenty of people that enjoy this, so go away.  Yeah, a lot of pigs enjoy it.  How does it feel to know that most of your life is over?  Does that bother you, that you're never going to be the young, attractive girl anymore?  No, it doesn't, because I'm getting what I want right now.  Shut up with your bunions.  You're getting nothing.  You're a miserable old bitch.  I bet you I get more looks than these 20-year-old sluts.  Oh, you're a delusional bag. 
[00:35:30]  No, she probably does, from guys looking to rob her for her check once a month, because  you're old and meek, and you can't cross the street.  I've seen these women.  They walk around Central Park with their little puny white dogs.  They've had facelifts that stretch that they look like a goddamn cryptkeeper.  They wear short little skirts, and you can see their white pale legs.  You can see their pulse through those blue veins.  Shut up!  Die!  She hasn't been the same ever since Jon Voight asked her for money in Midnight Cowboy.  You weren't going to ask me for money? 
[00:36:00]  At least I don't need a whatcha call...  I don't need to have my body...  You're 55, and you just said whatcha call it?  You uneducated zilch.  Whatcha call it?  Hey, I'm talking on your level.  Money.  No, you're not.  Money.  You're a dumb old person.  Money, we call you out.  Get your ass down here.  Come on down.  We'll pay.  Give me your address.  We'll pay.  You come down.  If you don't show up, that means you're just full of ass.  She won't show up.  Exactly.  All right, I'm full of ass.  Why don't you play bingo and have a stroke?  You're not going to show up, stupid.  You're not. 
[00:36:30]  You think I won't?  No, I guarantee you won't.  I want to prove to you that a 55-year-old woman can look just as good.  Big gray muff looking like Albert Einstein eating a London broil.  Looks like Donahue with those big fake wax lips on.  Really?  Right?  How do you know that?  Money, just get down here.  What's your address?  Hold on.  You ain't showing, so I don't even know why I'm wasting my time.  Why don't you just be honest for one?  You're not even giving your real name.  Oh, you're not wasting your time.  Sandy, you're not going to be. 
[00:37:00]  I'm going to prove to you that a 55-year-old woman can look.  Money.  You know something, money?  There are 55-year-old women that could look really hot, and they wouldn't call up bitching  about how other women that are hot come on this program.  No.  You, by you bitching about this, it just proves you're a jealous, delusional slob that should  just please figure out a way to kill yourself and make the world a better place.  I think you should kill yourself.  Ooh.  And know that. 
[00:37:30]  Wow, that's like a Marion comeback.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was good.  I think you should kill yourself, because you know why?  Why?  Because there's nothing, no fence in your life.  Huh?  What?  What did you say?  Right.  No what in our life?  There's no fence.  What?  What?  I was 20 when Kennedy was shot.  What did you say?  No fence in our life.  What?  There's no meaning in your life.  How many different types of psychosis drugs are you on?  How many?  What do you take?  Lithium?  You're on Paxil? 
[00:38:00]  What do you take?  Oh, I'm on them all.  Yeah, I bet you are.  I bet you are.  Yeah.  You cannot deal with the horror nightmare that is your life, Money.  And you can't deal with a husband that probably just despises you.  Oh, he doesn't.  So you pop your drugs like Tic Tacs and call up this show and try to blame us for the misery that's your life.  The misery of my life.  I just don't.  I think it's degrading.  Ever since Danny DeVito threw you off that train, you've had an attitude. 
[00:38:30]  What do you do with your life, Money?  What do I do with my life?  Yeah, we entertain people and hopefully make them laugh every afternoon.  I think that's a good life.  What do you do?  What do I do?  I do normal everyday things, but regular good women do.  Exactly.  Like a subservient dummy, which is what you are.  You shop and you clean the toilet.  Yeah, what do you do?  No, I have a maid.  Really?  So another woman you're degrading.  Pay her to do your womanly chores, you dope? 
[00:39:00]  No.  Not only do you have a bag of meat, you're lazy.  She has to live, too.  Is she a colored woman, Money?  No, she's white.  Like you used to call them back in the day?  No, she's white.  I know you like the black girls.  See, I thought you don't listen to the show.  You know everything about us in the show.  Everything about us.  Listen, anybody who talks the way you do and degrades women, has to which I'm gone.  I hate that degrade.  If there was a room of guys that love women more than us, I dare you to find it.  What?  We adore women. 
[00:39:30]  We love their form.  It's a beautiful thing.  So what the hell are you even talking about?  That's fine to adore them.  No, money, money.  I just put them down like their little hoards.  You have no idea how we treat women, so shut up.  You can tell by the way you talk.  I allow women to serve as my big, delicious mule.  What are you talking about?  I allow women to serve as me.  Maybe that's why you're not married, because every woman knows that you're what you call it.  That's why.  We don't want to be married.  Ask your husband how much he enjoys being married. 
[00:40:00]  We're not married because we want to bang as many girls as possible, you idiot.  Pull the 38 barrel out of his mouth and ask him a question.  I want to grab as many of you dopes by the hair and give you a mouthful of learning as I can.  A mouthful of learning?  What could possibly be wrong with that?  Gee, that was...  I could teach you more.  You probably could.  If I wanted to know how much things cost in 1940, you're the one I'd come to, wrinkle-bodied big back.  But if I want to dump, I'm finding a 20-year-old. 
[00:40:30]  When was the last time you talked to Rue McClanahan?  Exactly, you blue-haired wig wearing nothing.  Tommy!  What's up?  Hey, money.  Yeah, how much you pay your maid to clean the trailer?  Zero lives in the trailer, baby.  Why do you call yourself money?  Is it because you're old and wrinkled?  I don't have a wrinkle on my book.  You know what?  You know what?  You people are nothing to talk to.  Yes, that's absolutely right.  I would like one time, one time on your show... 
[00:41:00]  To what?  See, you want...  Women are women.  Admit what you want.  Bull, bull, you want to come on here and walk around?  I'm going to have everyone go, oh, wow, look how hot she is.  You know what?  You're so jealous.  You're so delusional because that's never, ever going to happen because you're a slob.  Go watch the view, money.  Why don't you give me your address?  You will absolutely get the address.  You come down here and we'll see what a stank hoe you are.  Are you going to...  What do you call...  Are you going to...  Are you going to...  That'll be great.  Pay for me to come down there? 
[00:41:30]  Pay?  Pay.  How much do you want?  How much do you want?  How about a little nitroglycerin for under your tongue?  I'll give you gas money.  I'll give you gas money, you show up.  I'll give you BJ money.  You can have your BJ.  I'll give you a 50 to take a mouthful of hiv.  I do it for nothing.  Oh, good girl.  I kind of respect her.  I do it for nothing.  Wait, wait.  Do you have kids?  I can give better sex up and...  We know you can.  We know you can.  I'm jealous and realizing her life is over.  Have you been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and you're just jealous that all the 
[00:42:00]  young gals have their years ahead of them?  Is that your problem?  I don't know.  When was the last time you gave up?  I have no problem with the girls.  I got the problem with you guys, Donna Mike.  Right, because they represent men who look at the girls stupid.  Of course you want to get the girls.  Yeah, I just want to get laid.  Men like your husband who can't stand the sight of your wrinkled, awful Leon let back anymore.  And he's looking at 20-year-olds, you stupid fullback.  You just made a Leon let job?  Give me your address.  Money.  And then when I come down, you will see.  Call us crazy for wanting to get laid. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And no always means yes.  You know that.  So if a girl even says hello to me, I just punch her and take it.  That's a guy's number one job, to get laid.  Yep.  Everything else comes second.  Herner, fake, fake morality.  Yep.  Your phony, fake morality.  Give her the address, and please on that day, get another crazy homeless guy around here  with a cinder block and pound it over her head.  Paris Drake.  Paris Drake with a goddamn cobblestone.  Money, we look forward to the day that you don't show up and you blow us off.  Yep.  I won't blow you off. 
[00:43:00]  When are you coming?  What day?  What day?  Today.  You tell me.  Today.  Today.  I can't come today.  Oh, why can't you?  Why not?  Yeah, what are you doing so important?  What am I doing?  Yeah.  Why can't you come down today?  Because I don't feel like driving down there today.  Exactly.  You have nothing to do today.  I'm not hitting traffic.  You have nothing to do today, and when we hang up on you, you'll listen to the entire  show.  You think so?  Guaranteed.  She'll chase traffic.  And you tell your other friends, I call the radio, and they'll go, huh?  What?  This is the exact same conversation we had with Martha, and she called the next day when 
[00:43:30]  we said she wasn't going to listen anymore.  She continued to listen, and so will you.  Listen to you?  Keep listening.  Keep listening.  Keep listening.  You've got to be kidding me.  Listen to that voice.  I'd like to hear you once in a while say something about...  Once in a while?  How many packs a day do you smoke at a time?  Once in a while, I thought you said you didn't listen to us.  I said I would love to have to listen to you one time and have you talk.  How yellow are your fingernails, Money, from the Paul Mall you probably smoke? 
[00:44:00]  I don't smoke.  A big yellow.  Then what's with that voice?  I have a cold, and I have longitis.  Oh, poor baby.  Your rotten old lungs are filling up with fluid.  Let's go from garbage.  So hope it's anthrax.  At least I don't take drugs like you guys do.  I hope it's anthrax.  Hey, Money, let me tell you.  Oh, a potty mouth gold bag.  Hey, did you hang up?  She drops the F-bomb, calls you an F, and then hangs up.  I called her a twat.  What happened? 
[00:44:30]  There's a gracious older woman who's using profanity.  Well, it pisses me off, and I'll tell you why.  Because Ed and I have said on many, many occasions, we don't do drugs anymore.  And it's been a long, long time.  But I love Money.  We love her.  Get your facts straight.  Believe me, I'd bang Money in a second.  I just hope she's...  I don't care if other people want to do drugs.  I hope she's weeping.  We don't do drugs.  I hope she's weeping from the taste of reality.  She just kind of...  A little taste of reality.  She wears those awful...  What are those pants, those polyester pants that all women wear? 
[00:45:00]  And you grab their ass, and it's just...  What?  The stretchy...  The polyester.  It just...  Do you understand what I mean?  It's a horrible, uncycling pants.  No, no, those are hot.  Those are like a tight, and they hug the buns.  Like a polyester baggy or tight?  They're awful baggy.  They're like polyester with straight pleated, like, fronts.  They're like nurse pants, but they're like different colors.  Oh, okay.  Those awful pants that old ladies wear.  And there's just no distinguishing where the back hip ass thing starts. 
[00:45:30]  It's just one continuous, disgusting, straight line.  One long, just brittle mess.  Wonderful.  Yeah, they have the elastic belt.  All right.  Well...  All right, Anthony, we're going to step aside for a minute or two.  Yeah.  And continue.  Colin Quinn's stopping by today.  Hopefully, Barry Williams calling in.  Yeah.  And when is the junk doctor calling?  Five o'clock.  Five o'clock, okay.  More of your phone calls as well.  As we go to break, we were called the most offensive radio show in local... 
[00:46:00]  Radio history.  Local Buffalo radio history.  Yes.  So somebody came up with this, the Pooh Pooh Plotters.  The most offensive show in local radio history.  Niggers, spit, kike, chick, muddog, pickity.  Naked team girls with their pants down to their knees.  Take a squat on Norton's face.  Make fun of HIV.  Whip them out. 
[00:46:30]  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Forever may your boobies hang high.  Make fun of those unfortunate like retard state corgi.  Uh-oh.  The most offensive show in local radio history.  The Opie and Anthony F. Uline.  It's there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:47:00]  Stop sending us pictures of old ladies naked, please.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  That demands you to stop.  That picture you're looking at right now, that lady should be flying in front of the moon in a bicycle basket.  It's like she was just sitting at the home.  She's just staring off in his face and someone flopped her can out of her bra.  She don't even know.  She's trying to kill George C. Scott's daughter in The Exorcist 3. 
[00:47:30]  Thank you for that.  Fat Will Nuns sent me that from Williamsburg.  It's a picture of an old woman.  Colin Quinn's going to be here in minutes.  Golly.  His show was on the other night on NBC.  It rocked.  I was very offended by it.  It was racially insensitive, and I want to tell him that.  Ah, Jimmy.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Yo, man, what is going on with that commercial about bedwetting?  I mean, for Christ's sake, who the hell is going to listen to that on this show? 
[00:48:00]  What's the jag up?  We thought that'd be a good idea to put that on O&A.  Well, can I tell you something, Jimmy?  You bring up a good point.  You know, regular radio listening, when we hear commercials, let's be honest with each other.  A lot of people will see what else is out there, okay?  With this show, you cannot turn the dial when the commercials play, because they're ridiculous.  Yeah.  You got to kind of tune in and listen to what the hell it's going to be.  Is it going to be an F potion?  It might be the ladies' F potion. 
[00:48:30]  It might be something to make your schlong bigger.  Right.  I mean, seriously, they're talking about digging.  We might have something that makes your hair grow.  Lose weight?  No, lose weight product.  Something like that.  But now I'm here, and we might have a bedwetting commercial that's advertising for our show.  So now, along with the people that love having lots of sex and growing hair and losing weight  and getting energy, we have people that wet the bed.  What is this spot?  Do you know what the sound of dignity is?  I mean, come on.  Who else does this show know what that is?  Do you know what this is, Steve C.? 
[00:49:00]  Steve C., bedwetting?  Yeah.  I believe it's a product that is, what?  Is this guy calling from this area?  I heard this spot, because I know what he's talking about, but I might have heard it on  1010 Winds, our news affiliate.  Where are you calling from, dude?  Actually, my car in Manhattan.  Yeah, see?  Oh, well.  How does the commercial go?  It's like, do you hear this?  This is the sound of dignity.  It's ridiculous, man.  It has to do with something you put over your bed, I think. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  It's like a diaper for your bed.  It's a diaper for your bed.  My mom's listening to this.  I think it is.  Yeah.  What is this?  Okay, now I know what it is.  All right, let's hear.  Wait, what is it, though?  I think it's a diaper you put over your bed.  No way.  It's not new, though.  It's not new.  No?  I think this has been there for a couple weeks, I think.  Yeah?  Is this better than the dream cream?  Let me...  Where you just need a little fingertip?  A little dab on your finger?  A little dab will do you.  Norton.  The specimen of Nurse Ratchet. 
[00:50:00]  It might be this commercial.  What's a quickie?  This is the sound of dignity.  Oh, God.  For your older child who suffers bedwetting, you'd probably pay anything to help them wake  to the pride of crisp, dry sheets.  With new sleep dries, you don't have to.  Sleep dries offer premium absorbency, but they cost less.  They'll feel proud about their dry bed.  You'll feel smart about the money you save.  Yeah.  New sleep dries for mornings everyone feels good about.  From the makers of loves. 
[00:50:30]  Price is based on leading brand as of 1231-2001.  Then again, if you can't afford the little thing for the bed and the kids are wet in, there's  always the Andrea Yates solution.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  You're horrible.  Stop.  Now, I don't get what that is.  Is it a sheet?  Is it a cover sheet?  Because it sounds like the sound of dignity is a whoosh, like a sheet going out.  Something you cover his body and have to kill him for doing it.  Now you don't have to be embarrassed because you have a bedwetting child.  You kill him and throw him in the woods.  Oh, man. 
[00:51:00]  Jesus.  I'm just like when they come down and do it on the floor in front of company like  Reagan in The Exorcist.  You're all going to die up there.  Now, that's hot.  Scary and a sexy.  All at once.  Oh, you little devil.  Huddle, huddle, get it?  Anthony, they left this clip out of the commercial.  Uh-oh.  It's all gooey.  Yes.  Little butters.  Little butters.  I can't tell what the sound of dignity is.  Is it a diaper for the kid or is it...  No, because they've got diapers.  Is the kid bobbing for dignity? 
[00:51:30]  It's a sheep.  It's the sound of a 12-year-old Gary getting shot down by an opiate gang going to the  Islanders game.  All right, Jimmy.  So now he wets the bed.  All right, Jimmy.  Thanks, guys.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  I'm glad that our listeners point out the silly commercials.  Yes.  That one is probably a silly commercial as far as our radio show goes.  Yeah.  What are the real advertisers?  Well, I think...  We've kind of proven ourselves at this point.  I think we're at the point now where we might just have to call Major... 
[00:52:00]  Major companies ourselves and try to get them on the show.  It's not a bad idea.  We should...  And we should do it on the air.  It sounds a little wacky, but if it helps our show, god damn it, I'm willing to do it.  I want to be proud of some of the commercials that run on our show.  Ford Motor Company.  Yeah.  It's like, wow, you know?  Verizon.  It wouldn't advertise you guys because you're...  You're...  Oh, my God.  I can't think of the word.  You stink.  You're...  Oh, my God.  I am a...  Controversial?  I was trying to say controversial, and I almost said conversational. 
[00:52:30]  Ah.  I should be beaten with a rock.  Ah.  Just stab yourself repeatedly.  You are...  Ah, Jim?  I can't remember the word again.  Damn, what's going on?  Oh, and A.  Yeah, the sound of dignity is a mother smothering her child with a pillow.  Jordan, you stink.  Controversial.  Controversial.  It's just alluding me.  Conversational.  No, controversial.  And they're afraid of upsetting, like, Coke and those things.  They're not...  Those companies...  They're not going to advertise on your show because...  I don't know.  Maybe they don't.  They're edgy.  Maybe they don't. 
[00:53:00]  You know what it is?  I think they need the personal touch.  What?  I think that's what it is.  They need the personal touch because it goes through sales and their people on that end.  And I just think we should talk to one of the head muckety-mucks there.  I don't know.  Dude, I forgot the word again.  I swear to God.  Stop it.  I'm not...  I'm not even telling you.  We're not wasting any more time.  I'm falling into a bit of yours or something.  No, no, I'm not...  At this point, who cares?  You're right.  You need an anvil over your head.  Ebonics.  Wait.  Controversial.  Hello?  Sir?  Walter? 
[00:53:30]  Yep.  I meant to say...  God's going to get you for that, Walter.  Walter.  Hey, guys.  Hold on a minute, okay?  All right.  We'll help you out.  Ladies, we need you to call for Walter.  We'll explain in a minute, okay?  Walter likes when girls do certain things to him.  Yes.  Leslie?  Yeah.  Have you ever heard Walter on our show?  No.  We haven't had him on in a while.  Leslie, what's up?  Well, first I want to tell you that I love you guys.  Thank you.  I'm a stay-at-home mom, and I look forward to making my dinner and coming in the kitchen 
[00:54:00]  and listening to you guys and having a good laugh.  Good.  Okay.  But I'm a little disappointed.  Why?  Well, because I get in the car today at 3 o'clock, and I'm waiting to get a couple laughs, and  all of a sudden I've got corn.  Corn, yeah.  I don't want to hear corn.  Yeah.  You got it.  I don't want to hear music.  Leslie.  I want to hear you guys.  Leslie.  I don't want to laugh.  If I want to hear music, I'll put on...  How weird is this?  I'll put on...  It used to be...  Listen.  Look at my daughter.  Shut up and play the music.  Leslie.  I know.  I remember that.  You got to understand something, Leslie.  What's that?  Us playing the corn thing was a... 
[00:54:30]  It was kind of a...  I don't know.  A double-edged sword.  On one thing, we wanted to hear it, and for a lot of music fans out there, the song  rocks.  It sounds great.  And on the second side of that is...  Yeah.  We knew it was going to piss a lot of people off.  And that's why you got to bear with us.  Yeah, so if you weren't into that, you got to allow us that one pleasure.  It was only four minutes, but trust me.  No, but you know...  There are phone calls being made right now.  People babbling back and forth.  How did they get that?  We didn't. 
[00:55:00]  What are we going to do now?  I don't know.  Tape it off the old Peter Anthony Show.  As a matter of fact, Leslie.  Yes?  I hold in my hand a cease and desist from Sony Music.  Yeah.  Yeah, we had the world premiere of the song from Corn.  Yeah.  Well, I'm very happy for you guys.  It is.  But then I changed the channel, and I give you a few minutes to play your song, and I  come back, and it's on again.  Well, yeah.  Well, that was just to rub it in.  Double shot.  What are you doing to me?  We kind of like to kick people when they're down. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Well, thanks a lot.  We'll be the first to admit that.  Leslie.  It's not good enough to knock the person down and hurt them.  Then we like to kick them.  As a fan of this program, you have to understand how much pleasure it gives us to really screw  with somebody.  And sometimes, you know, you've got to take that into consideration.  Although a lot of people did enjoy the song, and I think it rocks.  It makes me want to...  I didn't know the firm was back together.  Oh, oh.  Oh, the firm.  The firm.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's phone calls being made as we talk to Leslie. 
[00:56:00]  Well, here, let me read this, Opie.  March 14, 2002, via facsimile and hand delivery.  They weren't just going to let the old facsimile machine do its job.  R.E.  Corn here to stay.  Dear Mr. Coleman.  It's addressed to Jeremy Coleman.  Because he's sort of our program director.  Did Jeremy read this and just panic and run under his desk?  Yes, probably.  In fear?  He's got a little hard hat on now. 
[00:56:30]  Is that what it is?  A little war helmet thing.  He's quite fearful.  He's in war mode.  He's quite fearful.  Quite fearful indeed.  Dear Mr. Coleman, we are informed that your station has obtained  and has been playing an unauthorized copy of the corn track here to stay.  The sound recording copyright and the exclusive exploitation and distribution right  in this recording are owned by Sony Music Entertainment Incorporated.  And this recording has not yet been released by us for broadcast or distribution. 
[00:57:00]  Your unauthorized possession or broadcast of here to stay and or your participation in its unauthorized reproduction  infringes Sony's rights.  Your premature broadcast will interfere with the successful promotion of the single  and will result, get this, in serious and irreparable injury to corn and Sony.  I think you'll get along.  I think you'll be all right.  We demand that you immediately cease and desist, hence the word cease and desist, 
[00:57:30]  from any further broadcast of here to stay, or you'll be held accountable in law and equity  for the damage caused by your conduct.  Be very truly yours, et cetera, et cetera.  All right, guys.  See, we did our job today, Leslie.  So this is the letter that tells us we can no longer play it.  We're going to hang that one up in our office.  It proves that we had the world premiere of the corn song.  Put it with the rest of them. 
[00:58:00]  Here to stay.  All right.  Thank you, Leslie.  All right, well, keep up the good work.  I enjoy your show, and take care.  Oh, Leslie?  Yeah.  Wait, no, no.  Actually, I do want her to stay.  I know Jim was doing his thing there.  Leslie?  Yeah.  Can you help us out with Walter?  What's the matter with Walter?  Well, he'll explain, okay?  All right.  Look at Dan from Hoboken.  Did Jeremy run into the panic room?  You know, the movie?  The panic room.  The door slammed shut.  Jeremy's just hiding, looking at the video monitors. 
[00:58:30]  Security.  Hold on.  All right, Leslie, here we go.  I'm here.  Here's Walter.  Walter.  Hey.  We haven't talked to you in many, many months.  We're now on in a lot of other cities since we last talked to you.  So you've got to explain to the new cities what you're all about.  Well, I'd rather you guys do it.  Oh, well, explain.  I'd rather you guys explain.  No, no.  You tell everybody what you like, Walter.  I like it when girls laugh at me while I play with myself.  What?  Wow.  I couldn't hear that. 
[00:59:00]  Did you have marbles in his mouth?  Well, hold on, because they probably dove out.  They might have, but Leslie.  They might have dove out.  All I heard was Leslie go, what?  His name is Walter Kurtz, and he was the best the Army had to offer.  And he likes it while girls laugh at him while he makes himself very happy.  Right.  When he does things to himself.  Right.  So he will do things to himself, and he likes girls to laugh at him.  Right.  Laugh your goddamn heads off.  Walter, what kind of laugh do you like? 
[00:59:30]  A real laugh.  A real...  Why is this a turn-on to you?  Because it is.  Something to do with his mother?  I guarantee your mother, was she domineering or really castrating?  No.  Come on, it's got to go back to that.  No, it doesn't.  You don't know...  Walter, how old are you?  What?  How old are you?  I'm in my 20s.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Really?  You sound a lot older.  I thought he was an old guy.  Nope.  Leslie, are you looking for a little excitement today from your radio show? 
[01:00:00]  You want to help us out?  Well, I mean, all I have to do is laugh.  Yeah, I don't think it's cheating.  I think your husband will be okay with this.  He's probably listening right now.  Walter, are you ready, let's say?  Yeah, I'm ready.  How ready are you?  Really ready.  Ugh.  All right, Leslie?  Okay, yeah.  Can you give him a real laugh?  Um, well, you guys make me laugh.  No, you know what it is?  You know how to act a little bit, right?  Yeah, so I mean, do I give a full-out horse laugh? 
[01:00:30]  Do a full-out laughing and just keep it going.  All right.  Like, keep it going and just keep laughing at him and mock him like, oh, Walter, oh, God,  you know.  Like, Walter, you're such a freak?  Yeah, all that stuff.  Yeah, just laugh at him.  All right.  All right, here we go.  Okay, ready?  Yeah.  Walter, you freak  What are you doing? 
[01:01:00]  You psycho freak  How was that?  Keep going  Keep going?  Well, Walter, what do you think?  Not good  Not good enough  Well, we got to  Come on  I heard a couple of  How about this?  Does this help?  Leslie, you are sick 
[01:01:30]  I'm going to hang up on  Very good, Leslie  Thank you  Bye-bye  It helped me  Do we have any other ladies?  Splash into a bathtub  It would have helped even more  Oh, off the dock  Black man took him  We need more ladies to laugh at Walter  That's what she said  As we say hi to Colin Quinn  Colin  I'll tell you, we could all use a good laugh  With some of the news that's going on these days, right?  Wow  Right into it 
[01:02:00]  That's how I opened my act  Yes  Colin  Colin, we were like  Just loving your show  Thanks  We were all over the radio the next day going  Oh my God  First of all, nothing like it on TV  It's what we need  It's funny  It has nothing to do with being politically correct  It's honestly just funny  Thanks  They said in the paper  It's the bravest show  Since she's the sheriff  Really?  Wow  That is brave  That's pretty impressive 
[01:02:30]  It was good  It reminded me of the original Saturday Night Live  When it first came out  Like in the early 70s  When it was just like the mid-70s  Where you turn in and go  Holy shit  What are they doing?  You can't do  What?  Very funny on it  Who be winning?  That one killed me  The line  Well, I thought that was a little too much  Oh, did you?  That guy really pushes the envelope  So, how many shows are they going to give you? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, they really  They gave us a vote of confidence  Three  Three shows  Yeah  The first one did well, though, right?  Not really  Ratings-wise  What?  It did all right  It plummeted from Fear Factor  Really?  I mean plummeted  Who cares about Fear Factor?  It plummeted  No, but it still did  They're happy with it, you know  Yeah  That's why we're going to end up picking up  Well, Jim, you watched that 80s show  I told you to watch our show  But you put on Becker  Which pissed me off  Becker  It was a good episode 
[01:03:30]  I'm surprised I didn't see Jim Norton  On the show  All your other friends were on it  Norton's coming on  Norton's coming on this next show  Oh  We're going to start rotating  You know, we just want to bring everybody in  That would really hurt  But I couldn't say  Because the show was called  Actually, Colin and all his friends  But Norton  I felt like I was at the comedy cell  Watching the show  Exactly  I saw like the opening 10 minutes  The monologue  And it was just brilliant  I was so happy  It was like  Look at how angry  It was great though  It was edgy  It was smart  Yeah, anybody  You got to run that past people 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, there was a few little  There was a few little glitches  But everybody  They were fine with it  But I told them from the beginning  If you don't like  It's not going to be cursing  If you don't like ethnic stuff  You know, you might as well not  Do the show  That's what the whole thing is  You know  And they  Said it's cool  And went  Yeah, I guess so  That's great  All right, hold on  We got to get Walter off  And then we'll  Oh, damn, yeah  Do you know what's going on here, Colin?  No, somebody laughs at him  And he gets off on that  Yeah  I figured that out pretty quick, huh?  I didn't know when you stepped in  He's like the real deal, though  Walter, you want to give this another try? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah  All right  All right, hold on, Walter  Yeah  Let's go to Dawn  Dawn  I didn't know Slip Mahoney  He was a sex slipper  Mahoney  Hey, you know what?  What do we got to give away?  We got to give something to the lady that, you know  Oh, gets him to finish?  Yeah, makes it happen for Walter  We got tons of stuff?  Dawn, we got tons of stuff in the prize closet  So if you put them over the top  Then we're going to give you something, okay?  Okay  All right  I want to know first how big his junk is

You really got emotion in his voice.  All right, Barry.  I'd say something Lady Di would say if you said that to us.  Why I oughta.  Thanks a million. 
[01:10:00]  Well, Walter, we'll help you out again in the future, all right?  All right.  There he goes, Walter.  Take it easy.  There you go, Scram.  That is disturbing, man.  He completed with Don.  Yeah.  And that's all it takes.  Girls laughing at him.  David.  All right.  David, real fast.  Yeah.  You have the same fetish?  Hell yeah.  What is it?  So much fun, man, when girls laugh at me.  Why?  Why is it fun?  I don't know why.  It's just like I get off so fast. 
[01:10:30]  When girls laugh at you.  Yeah.  It's like, it's just, it's so humiliating.  It's like so much fun.  Who humiliated you when you were young?  Oh, I guess my mother did.  Why is it?  It's interesting.  Oh, Dr. Drew's here.  No, I'm interested.  It's the why would you get...  And you got the same type of voice as Walter.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know what you should do?  Get a girl over there and put her on Notting Hill.  That gets him going every time.  That's just a funny movie.  All right.  I'm nodding off.  That's what I was doing during that piece of crap.  All right, David. 
[01:11:00]  Okay.  Bye.  Wait, David.  That is weird.  I've never heard of that fetish.  No.  No.  Suddenly laying down and having a little yellow loveliness shot all over you.  It doesn't seem so odd, does it, boys?  Ah, it tastes popcorn-y.  Party started.  I think the country owes Jim an apology.  Yeah.  Colin Quinn's here.  We'll catch up with him next, okay?  Yes.  Can I see your taint?  Nice. 
[01:11:30]  Taint nice.  Taint nice.  Between the peach and the blue knot.  Can we see your butt?  Nice.  I would have to just blank on your chin.  Does this guy know how to party or what?  Okay, terrific.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Colin Quinn in the studio.  But on our phone, Anthony.  Yes.  I think Entertainment Tonight wants him, so we only have a few minutes with him.  Oh, damn.  The big loser. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, no.  Don't call him that.  From the celebrity boxing king last night.  It's Barry Williams.  Barry.  Barry.  If I may say I'm sorry.  What a performance on Fox's Celebrity Boxing.  I watched it last night.  And Danny Bonaduce.  I got to say it.  Made you his biatch.  You did connect a couple times, didn't you?  A couple.  Barry.  Barry.  Whenever you two got into fist range of each other, you were on the canvas. 
[01:12:30]  I started thinking you were on a pay-per-knockdown basis.  It was amazing.  But you kept getting up.  I'll give you that.  Hey, I got in the ring.  Okay.  That was a stupid move.  That was a good move.  Sure.  Well, you know, there are just things that we do for things we believe in.  And first of all, I naively thought maybe I could actually take him down.  Wow.  But the other thing is I get to do some good for a charity I care about. 
[01:13:00]  Well, bravo.  You did good for a charity.  So something good came out of this.  When did you realize that you were in trouble?  Oh, about midway down to my knees the first time.  Really?  The first knockdown?  I knew I was going to be okay because he didn't knock me out.  But I was thinking, oh, my God, this is not good.  What is it?  You get hit and your legs just collapse on you?  You don't really know.  The next thing you know is you're looking up at the world.  You look like a newborn calf. 
[01:13:30]  Colin, it's a little like doing a stand-up routine that flops.  You know what I mean?  Did you know he's a third-degree black belt, Danny Bonaduce?  I do now.  And he's kind of built like a fireplug.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he went after you.  And he had that right hand that when it connected with the side of your head, it was over.  Yeah, well, you know what happened?  I got 10 days to train for this fight.  Oh, man.  10 days, right?  So I'm training like I'm used to boxing, which is having punches come out of your shoulder. 
[01:14:00]  He's roundhousing me.  Yep, that's what he was doing.  He was coming around on the side of your head.  With some lightning speed.  And I swear to God, I did not see it coming.  I felt if I could have defended it, you know, maybe he would have been open and I'd get a right in there.  But he was pretty strong.  Hey, Barry, at least you didn't look as ridiculous as Vanilla Ice did.  Oh.  Oh, that was really brutal.  Or how about Paula Jones?  Thank you very much.  Trying to run out of the ring at any given moment. 
[01:14:30]  She kept turning around and running away.  I know.  Yeah, real great boxing technique there.  Well, maybe that's something you should have tried, Barry, because when you faced him, you were down.  It was not pretty.  It was not pretty.  But, you know, I had a job to do.  My job was to stand in there and take it, you know, as long as I could.  And then they called a fight on me.  Not that I was particularly disappointed.  Yeah, I noticed your corner threw in the towel after.  How many knockdowns was that?  I think two.  Maybe it was three.  I don't know. 
[01:15:00]  I think it might have been four.  It was one too many.  That's for darn sure.  When you went down the last time, the corner threw the towel in.  And I noticed even when you try to get up, you were having a little trouble.  Would you have gotten up if they didn't throw the towel in?  I did get up.  And I went over to the corner and I said, are we going to finish this?  And they said, no.  And I said, okay.  And that was that.  They said, Barry, the fight was two days ago.  You know, here's the thing.  You know, you get asked to do some of these crazy things and you figure them out.  And then sometimes you find out, oh, well, you know what?  Maybe I'm not 27 years old anymore. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, are you going to be changing your name?  From the butcher?  Like maybe a Muslim name.  Switch to Muslim.  It seems to work.  Barry Muhammad Williams.  I would accept I get tired of getting checked and screened at the airport.  Oh, at the airports.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't you know Muhammad Barry Williams?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Don't you wish you could go back to like when you were 12 and he was 10 and just beat his brains in?  Oh, you have no idea.  See, now, I think during the Brady Bunch Partridge family reign on television, you could have kicked his little redhead ass. 
[01:16:00]  No question.  And I should have gotten that picture out of my head.  Oh, is that it?  You saw the little Danny Partridge?  Well, see, I knew he'd done some training and stuff.  But I didn't realize the guy was all his anger from rehab into boxing and karate.  Well, before that, he was in, like, Thailand for years, like fighting in the Kumite and stuff.  In between betting down young boys, I believe.  Now, wait a minute.  Well, you can talk trash before the fight, but not after. 
[01:16:30]  Come on, the guy beat up a tranny.  Yes, and trannies are there to be loved and paid.  As Norton knows.  We don't agree with that.  I have to say, at least so far, Danny's been pretty gracious in his victory.  He has.  And he's even expressed the idea that he was concerned himself after the first round, which I guess just pissed him off.  Yeah.  And, you know, he prevailed.  That's, you know, what can I do?  Any chance for a rematch, Barry? 
[01:17:00]  Oh, sure, with you.  You know, the way you're talking that trash, Anthony, I think, you know.  No, no.  You know, Norton's going to mud wrestle the kid that played Jeremy on the part of the stage.  At Foxwoods.  No, no, no.  It's the girl that played Jerry on the Facts of Life.  There you go.  Yeah, there's a fight you could do.  Hey, Matt wants in on this.  Matt, what's up?  Yo, after the fight, did you hear Danny say the reason he was able to hang in there so long is he spent most of the 80s in a daze?  Yes, I did hear that.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Well, you know, I don't know if you know this, but one of the things he bragged about was getting off his medication before the fight.  I think he's on lithium or something like that.  Oh, really?  So he was definitely, you know, fired up, primed up, ready to go.  He pulled a Tyson on you.  That's what Tyson does.  He gets off all the drugs before the fight.  They take him off the Zoloft.  Yeah.  Yeah, Tyson's on the Zoloft, and then they put him in a cage and take the medication away.  And then when he's really crazy and he's throwing Samsonite luggage around, they throw him into the ring and let him just destroy. 
[01:18:00]  And then they actually, I've heard this, without the Zoloft in him, the corner people, they actually have to shoot him with tranquilizer darts and then pull him into the pickup truck and relocate him.  So he doesn't break into the local, because wherever the city is that they're holding the match, usually they find him, you know, Mike Tyson's at the dump, you know.  He's pawing through the trash.  It's dangerous for the children.  So they relocate him where he can get back on the Zoloft.  You want to know what's the scariest thing about this whole match?  Wow. 
[01:18:30]  We trounced the competition.  Fox pulled in, like, their second highest entertainment special ever, and we wiped out West Wing.  And I think we have more to see.  So submit your request.  It made the front page of the paper here in New York.  Yeah, people love stuff like this.  I mean, you know, people beating each other up and not just boxers anymore.  It's really great.  I think Ron and Fez were talking about how great it would be to have kids fighting. 
[01:19:00]  And I think we're close to that.  I don't think we're far.  Just having, like, eight-year-olds, seven-year-olds, just put them in a ring and let them beat the crap out of each other.  I'd watch.  That'd be fun.  Old people, geriatrics, just getting out there from the home and pounding each other.  You have to stop a fight because your prostate falls out.  Wouldn't that be great?  Oh, he just hit his colostomy bag.  It's a mess.  They're skating all over the ring, you know?  I want to know how Todd Bridges kept in such great shape over the years.  Jail.  Barry, he looked like Halle Berry in Monster's Ball. 
[01:19:30]  The guy, he was sporting some nice B's, maybe C cups.  Maybe that's what it was.  He wanted to get the fight over with as quickly as possible and get his shirt back on.  Because he just destroyed Vanilla Ice.  Yeah, that was not pretty.  He ran after him.  Now, I had just seen, two days ago, that HBO special on the prisons.  And they were showing closed-circuit clips of the yard fights. 
[01:20:00]  Where they just run after each other and just start pounding as hard as they can.  And that's exactly what Little Willis was doing.  That's what it looked like.  Ran after him and just started hitting him.  And Vanilla Ice couldn't take it.  His time in jail with the S-Ace was well spent.  Yes.  I think if Ice were smart, he would have taken my cue and just gone down.  Yeah, but you kept getting off.  I know, I know.  Well, listen, you know.  I think Barry could take the Iceman, though.  It's funny.  When you get in that ring and that bell goes off, it's primal.  That's all I can tell you.  It's primal. 
[01:20:30]  A little nerve-wracking.  No kidding.  It's dangerous.  Hey, Barry, John on Line 11 says, what did Barry do with the money?  You should tell everyone, because you're the only one that didn't put the money in your pocket.  Do you know how he did from the Backstreet Boys?  He lost his sister to lupus.  And he started a foundation called the Doral Lupus Foundation.  I've done concerts for him, and I am sliding the money over to them.  And the research is very promising, and maybe we can help some people there.  There you go.  Bravo, Barry Williams.  Everyone else put it in their back pocket. 
[01:21:00]  Hey, did you catch the little pseudo tattoo on Danny's back?  Yeah, a couple of the people were wearing that.  Yeah, it was worth another 510K.  Oh, was it?  Something like that.  Oh, yeah.  We should have put some advertising on your back, Barry.  Yeah, what should it have said?  O&A forever?  Well, if we thought you would have won the fight.  Yeah, I could have put Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  You know what?  We would have paid for that.  That would have been good.  And then you could put a tour to charity? 
[01:21:30]  No problem.  Then that little round girl who came out, you know, might have come out without her top on.  The round girl, Paula Jones?  No, no.  The girl with the...  Oh, I thought you meant the round girl.  Oh, okay.  The sign between the rounds.  I understand now what you're saying.  Well, I hope you're not too disappointed.  I mean, we've been friends.  We, uh...  It was great.  It was great to just watch.  People love watching people get beat up.  I don't care who the hell you are.  And to just see, uh, you, you know, we remember you as young Greg Brady and now getting the, 
[01:22:00]  uh, the crap beat out of you by young Danny Partridge.  It was amazing to watch, Barry.  Yeah, you just can't get better TV than that.  Now, do you have any line on who might, uh, be the next, uh, celebrity, uh, boxing?  No, I don't.  You know, I've been trying to think.  But, uh, I, I don't know exactly.  Colin, do you have any ideas?  Any other Bradys?  Uh, well, you know, I actually took over for Chris Knight.  That's how come I didn't get much warning on this.  Now, why didn't Chris Knight, uh, do it? 
[01:22:30]  Well, maybe he's smarter than I am.  Oh, okay.  Maybe.  I want to see Alice fight.  Are you crazy?  I want to see you fight Alice.  Yeah, that'd be fun.  But maybe we should do the mud wrestling thing like A's got going on.  Hey, is it true the USA Today had a caption that said,  Barry spent most of the time on the mat?  It better not be.  Hey, would you, would you allow the show to advertise on your stomach considering that  most of the time you're on your back in the ring?  Thank you very much.  Oh, God.  You know, I was just going to tell you how much I liked your television show, too. 
[01:23:00]  Isn't that horrible?  That wasn't me.  That wasn't Colin.  Oh, sorry, sorry.  Me and Norton sound exactly alike on the radio.  It's crazy.  Norton will be on the next Colin Quinn show.  Yeah, he will be on.  And as far as crazy events go, you two would be pretty hard to top with your naked girls  in the glass buses.  Well, maybe Fox will pick up on that, of naked girls in glass buses beating each other.  Well, you certainly had your play from the Post and from the NYPD and from USA Today. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, and CNN, too.  And CNN.  That's right.  That's right.  All right, Barry, we know you've got an interview to do, so.  Hey, Colin.  Yes.  Good luck with your show, man.  I love it.  Love you.  Thank you.  And O&A, you know, who else am I going to talk to the day after, for God?  I know, Barry.  How cool is that?  Thank you.  Barry Williams.  All right, you got it, man.  Come on in when you're in New York.  You got it.  All right, Barry Williams.  Okay.  Barry Williams.  I thought he had a tattoo on his back.  It said, Robert Reed was here. 
[01:24:00]  He's the first one to make jokes like that, though.  Barry Williams.  Far it.  Robert Reed.  He was the first celebrity fights, though.  Fighting the hiv, and he lost.  Knocked out.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious bemusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Filth and trash.  It's really bad, but it's really good. 
[01:24:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Colin Quinn in the studio.  Yeah.  It's time for remote control.  Remote control?  Remote control.  72 whooping cough lane.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Hey, Ken Opie's address on remote control.  Ah, there you go.  I used to have to announce it.  Ken Opie.  Ken Opie.  You know, our own Earl was on that show.  We brought this up before.  He said he was on remote control. 
[01:25:00]  Our own black Earl.  And for some reason, no one has a tape of this.  We can't get it.  We'd love to see how he fared.  Well, I recall not many black people on our show, and none of them did very well.  Yeah, I think he actually went all the way.  Really?  He was strapped to the bed, and yeah.  Did you go through MTV?  We would kill for that tape.  I know.  We've been searching for it for over a year.  We had a dinner after our friend Ted was an MTV guy that died.  Yeah.  And we had a dinner, and somebody mentioned to me remote control. 
[01:25:30]  These are the bigwigs, and they casually mentioned that the MTV tapes are lost.  They never...  Remote control tapes, I mean.  Really?  That was a great show.  Where the hell they go?  Who the hell knows?  No one knows.  They'll turn up someday in the future and end up like the Honeymooners Lost Episodes.  Yeah.  Foxes.  Those were a big success.  Oh, the bad Honeymooners?  Dan.  You ever see when those come on, you're psyched for a Honeymooners episode?  They come on, and you're like, ah, the lousy Lost Episodes.  Yeah.  I don't want to watch that. 
[01:26:00]  When we subpoenaed the remote control tapes, they said they'd been lost.  It's your government.  Remember, you're a dying king.  Dan, what's going on?  Not too much, man.  All right.  I got the inside tip on the next celebrity fight.  Oh, yeah?  Larry Flint and Christopher Reeve.  Oh.  Oh.  Bumper cars.  Oh.  Field chair match.  Nice.  Someone else is suggesting Gary Coleman and Emmanuel.  Take care, guys.  That would be great.  They could do a little joust, like a motorized wheel. 
[01:26:30]  Coing.  How about Boomer Esiason and Doug Flutie?  I'm out of here.  Yeah, so am I, man.  TJ.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  What's up?  Hey, I wanted to tell Colin I really dig the show, and I'm looking forward to the next two.  Oh, thanks.  But also, guys, it's almost 520.  You better do something good and funny. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, Colin, 520 is the time when the most people are listening to us.  Really?  I got to go listen to myself.  So we always save our best bit of the day for 520.  Oh, absolutely.  We don't know what that is.  Who told you guys that?  The marketing people?  We've broken it down into minutes and quarter hours.  We're looking at this quarter hour.  We've got three options for the 520 bit today.  Uh-huh.  We can hang with Colin.  Well, that goes without saying.  Yeah, I'll be there anyway.  Yeah, true.  What about with Charlie Laverne and Shirley? 
[01:27:30]  No, not today.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  I want to bring them on my show.  Do you?  You should.  Just have them sit there.  Hey, how are you?  They can just talk.  Like, as the comic is trying to say something, they're just going,  You're very funny.  Can I get an autograph from you?  Oh, man, I'd love to see Patrice's huge, meaty, black fist go right into one of their faces.  Colin, on live television.  I mean, the show is great, but I guarantee if you put them on to just start the show or something, 
[01:28:00]  you will have every O&A listener watching.  Hey, how are you?  Guaranteed.  You've got to write something for them.  Well, they write themselves, though.  In a little sketch.  You don't want to just have them, I don't know, the retarded apartment.  We have a brand new song from Q that makes fun of all the races again.  Ah, very good.  It's a St. Patti's Day turn.  Could that be the 520 bit today?  And now we've got a junk doctor on the line, too.  Dr. Whitehead is his name, and he's a penis surgeon. 
[01:28:30]  Dr. Whitehead.  Yeah, this is Dr. Whitehead.  Hi, Dr. Whitehead.  You are on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, boy, this ain't going to be the first one.  I know that.  And we want to know a little bit about what you do, Dr. Whitehead.  Well, Dr. Whitehead's a urologist in New York City, and the organization is New York Phalloplasty.  Uh-huh.  And what we do is we make patients longer and wider.  Oh, you do, do you? 
[01:29:00]  Really?  And that is done through, and I've heard other methods that are used.  What is your method?  Well, there are different methods.  We're talking about surgery.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  The surgical techniques can either be a fat injection technique for widening or putting in some of the patient's own skin for widening,  or the technique that I prefer, which I consider to be the state of the art, is donated skin from the cadaver.  It's like a kidney transplant or a heart transplant. 
[01:29:30]  All right, slow the F down.  Can I stop now?  Well, slow the F down.  Hold the phone now, Dr. Whitehead.  Dead guy skin on your junk to make it bigger.  We take skin from the cadaver, which is purified.  Purified cadaver skin.  How do you purify dead guy skin?  Well, it goes to a laboratory.  It's called the tissue laboratory.  A laboratory.  And then?  And it makes it pure so there's no transmission. 
[01:30:00]  Now, now, wait a minute.  You put it underneath the skin of your own member?  Well, not of my member, but of the patient's member.  Well, you know what I mean.  And it's just, it's just, it's skin, but it doesn't really, you don't see it on the outside.  You don't see it on the outside.  It's the undersurface of the skin called the dermis.  So you're doubling up the skin.  That's right.  It's a dermal matrix graft.  To get that Italian tuna can type of shot, as opposed to the big long Negro shot.  What if the, yeah, what if the cadaver is Japanese, doctor? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, yes.  What race is the best to use for the skin for the member widening?  Well, guess what?  God made the inside, the dermis, exactly the same on all races.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  They're all pink on the inside.  Now, listen, Dr. Whitehead, if that's your real name.  Sir, is there a scar on the mule from the surgery?  Ooh.  There is no scar from the donation of the site because it's coming freely from somebody else that's deceased, 
[01:31:00]  which is really an advance.  But what about your own member?  Does that get scarred?  Yes, of course.  Whenever you do surgery, you have to make an incision.  Well, where do you make the incision?  Hold on.  Hold on, guys.  Hold on.  Where is it?  There's two incisions.  There's one in the pubic hair, so it's concealed.  Okay.  And there's...  And that's also actually concealed. 
[01:31:30]  It is.  So it's almost not noticeable.  Whenever a surgeon does any surgery, there's always a scar, and we always have to see it's noticeable.  But with a very fine plastic surgical technique...  Colin is now looking for the valley right now.  He's searching down his path.  Look for the valley.  I need it on the valley.  Now, is it on the top side of the unit or the bottom side that you're talking about?  Oh, it's on the bottom side. 
[01:32:00]  You're absolutely right.  You were right the first time.  It's on the top side.  If you look at the penis head-on...  Right.  It's from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock, so it's just the top half.  Oh, right.  Where's the valley there?  There's no valley there.  It is.  He's talking about where the helmet stops.  Oh, okay.  That's right.  Right there.  That's more of a...  I think that's more of a wall than a valley.  Yeah.  It's like a mesa.  Yeah.  It's more of...  Is it a plateau?  Yeah.  Right.  Something like that. 
[01:32:30]  It's the last part of the rock climb.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  A valley is a very...  You always have that...  In a valley, you have to dip down first and then come back up.  We're looking if you're going across the top of your junk, you're hitting the helmet.  It's like an overhang.  It's behind the overhang.  All right.  It's concealed right in the valley, which is really nice.  By the shatter.  That's great.  I'm saying valley.  Hey, Doc, do you get to last longer because you've got dead guy skin on your junk?  Oh, does it affect the sensation, Dr. Whitehead?  It's a good question. 
[01:33:00]  It's actually two questions.  First of all, you don't get to last longer because it's got nothing to do with sexual  function.  Uh-huh.  And because it's dead guy skin, it means nothing.  It's put in there.  It's like the scaffolding on a building.  There's no brick.  Only dead guy scaffolding.  What happens is you're putting in the dead person, the cadaver's skin, which has been  purified, and your own skin goes in there to make it really your own.  Wow.  It becomes your own. 
[01:33:30]  So you've got a double thickness.  Where do you take the skin from if it's your own?  You don't take it from yourself.  That's the beauty of it.  So there's no donor sites.  There's no inhibition.  Where do you take it from on the cadaver, then?  It comes from the tissue bank.  I have no idea.  Man, that's God's little joke on everybody.  You're a straight guy.  You die, and your skin is used and used, and another man's junk.  Who knows?  And it might be a gay guy.  You know what?  You know what?  You're not putting the skin of a man ass around your junk.  Listen, don't bury your organs. 
[01:34:00]  God needs them here on earth.  I'll bury my organ whenever I want.  Yeah.  Dr. Whitehead.  I like burying my organ while I'm alive.  Dr. Whitehead.  Colin Quinn has a question.  Okay.  Do you think you'll ever have a client from either Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant, or Brownsville  in your entire...  Absolutely.  I've had them.  Come on now.  Let's don't be ridiculous.  I've had them.  Really?  I'm going to tell you something remarkable.  You want to listen carefully now?  I'm listening so carefully.  Are you listening?  Yes.  Virtually all of the men that have this surgery are completely normal. 
[01:34:30]  They just want to be larger.  Are you hung, Doc?  They just want to be larger.  Do you do it yourself, Doc?  I do the surgery myself.  Have you had it done on yourself?  No, sir.  No.  You're fine with your manhood.  You got a large mule?  It's called perceived penile inadequacy.  The guys are normal.  They would just like to be larger, and we're able to do it.  Yeah, well, it's what if your girlfriend has that.  Are you happy with your size, Doc? 
[01:35:00]  I'm very happy with mine.  Now, what is the guy, like, well, you're saying that the guys that come to have this done are of normal, average size?  They're all normal.  Very, very few are very small, and just the same very, very few are, you know, right on the top percentage.  But, Doc, I have a question.  What if you're doing the surgery, and you don't put the skin in properly, and then some girl goes home with a mouthful of dead skin?  Oh, God.  Norton, that could not possibly happen, Norton.  Please, we're talking with Dr. White.  Whoever asked that question doesn't understand what I said. 
[01:35:30]  Absolutely.  That's Norton, and he's an idiot, and he'll be appearing at town hall.  April 18th.  If you want to see more of his idiocy.  Doc.  Yep.  That's fantastic.  Now, let me ask you something.  What is average diameter or circumference, and what do you then boost it up to?  Okay.  The average length.  Yes.  Now, we're talking in the flaccid state. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  And the width is about, well, divide an inch by 2.54.  Isn't that a centimeter?  That's a centimeter.  Centimeter.  What are you saying centimeter for?  That's annoying me.  It's centimeter.  Yes.  It's a centimeter.  Yeah.  C-E-N-T, centimeter.  It's not the Washington Monument.  It's cent.  What are you, Mata?  About 8 centimeters.  Okay.  It's about 2 1⁄2 inches.  2 1⁄2 by 6 soft?  Who's got that?  That's a lot. 
[01:36:30]  6 soft?  That's stretched out, right?  That's a big mouthful of mule.  We're talking the stretch.  Big, delicious mouthful of mule.  Big, delicious, lucky boy to get a hold of that mouthful.  Sometimes you're standing around, you're comparing with your friends, you're all laughing.  Hey, Doc?  Yes, Doc?  I'm still here.  Is it okay to be a grower instead of a shower?  Let me get this right now.  Now, the average stretch length is about 6 inches.  Right.  5 1⁄2 to 6. 
[01:37:00]  Uh-huh.  Okay?  Now, the flaccid length, okay?  And what we're able to do, and I hope you guys are sitting down and you're serious, because this is serious stuff, okay?  Absolutely.  Because these guys are normal, and they want to have elective surgery.  Uh-huh.  This is because they want to feel better about themselves.  Right.  Okay?  We're able to give them approximately 1 inch added length, an approximately 30% increase in circumference.  That's about a one-third. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  All right.  How do you make it longer?  What we do is we release the suspensory ligament.  Yeah.  Okay, I've heard of this.  Let me explain and tell me if I'm right.  You kind of cut down near the, can we say the base?  It's the base.  Right.  And then you pull like it's a cord from a vacuum cleaner. 
[01:38:00]  The last part I don't get.  The first part you were right.  Well, you know those vacuum cleaners were...  The retractable cord?  Exactly.  You know where the cord is...  He's a cleaning lady.  He's a doctor.  Come on.  And you pull the vacuum cord out, let's say.  What you do is...  Throw the vacuum.  Let me put it in a way that you can understand because you know what?  I hope you've got 100,000 viewers but you're confusing them.  Viewers are looking at their radio like...  Let me...  Radio.  Let them visualize this, okay?  Okay.  All right.  All right. 
[01:38:30]  The penis, half of the penis is actually inside the body.  Not the tasty, half.  Penises.  No, wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on.  Dr. Whitehead, what are they dumping out?  Can I explain something to you real quickly first?  We have a problem on this station with the word penis.  If it's used in any other context, then probably just the way I said it.  So, what you have to do, if you could, for us, is say member. 
[01:39:00]  Okay.  We'll talk about the member.  Yes, thank you.  Half of the member is inside the body and the other half is on the outside.  Mm-hmm.  And it takes a course.  It goes up towards the...  By the way, which is strange.  What you see hanging on the outside...  Yeah.  ...is the outside.  So, there's actually a V.  So, what we do is we release the top of that V, which is touched to the bone.  Yes.  Cubic bone.  And now the penis does not become any longer. 
[01:39:30]  Or the member.  Oh, the member.  Yes.  That's a yummy word again.  Now, the member does not become any longer.  What happens is that a little bit of what is inside is now brought to the outside and it appears longer.  But isn't that also supposed to be there to hold things up to attention?  No.  Like a mass?  Won't it actually now not face north, but somewhere in the easterly direction?  That's a wonderful question because many people have asked that. 
[01:40:00]  And if the surgery is done correctly and the release is not too far back, there should be a very, very unusual surgery.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's the member.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, we're getting, we're getting things.  Jerry Falwell is cutting out of everything.  See, we have a dump guy he's called and he dumps out of our show with a digital delay, Dr. Whitehead.  And he is cutting, much like you do that tasty ligament, he is cutting out of our show. 
[01:40:30]  Why does he cut out of the show when you can say this kind of stuff on Lovelines if it's talked about medically?  Because that's after 10 o'clock.  It's called the State Harbor, Jim.  We're talking about the member.  But we are talking about this in a way that I do believe would be fine and dandy.  No one's goofing on it.  I know.  It's something this doctor does.  Yeah.  And let me tell you something.  If it would be advertised on this show, they'd be able to say it, right?  Yeah.  Right? 
[01:41:00]  As long as the vultures could get their talons into some cash.  Now, doctor, let me ask you a hypothetical question.  What if you got a guy whose member already kind of leans a little too far to the left?  Hypothetical.  How about you want anyone in particular?  Okay.  Most of the time...  This thing leads to the left.  Most of the time, when that happens, that's entirely normal.  Member will bend...  Wait.  Wait.  You cannot say that because the dump guy is going to dump out of that.  So other members of the Christian Coalition won't be upset.  Yeah.  But a doctor can't even say that.  What we have to deal with here... 
[01:41:30]  Ridiculous.  Can you believe what we have to deal with?  We want to talk openly and honestly about what you do, Dr. Whitehead.  But we have a dump guy and someone censoring our program.  Although he may not be dumping out of this.  He may be whacking his bag listening.  Yeah.  I think that's probably closer to...  That's not going to help you get what you want.  You know, everything's political.  Yeah.  Screw them.  All right.  Go ahead, Mr. Whitehead.  Well, Dr. Whitehead.  Keep the lawyers happy.  He's saying that it's normal.  It's normal if it hangs one way or the other. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  And, Doctor, we're getting a lot of questions.  How much does each of these procedures run?  Well, we really haven't talked about the procedures.  We ought to be specific.  There's one procedure to make the member longer.  Yes.  There's another procedure to make it wider.  Most of the guys wish to have the member made longer and wider at the same time.  Right.  Sir, I have a question for you.  Is there anything you can put on the end of it so that when a woman is, say, finished servicing, that she just dies? 
[01:42:30]  Just stop it, Norton.  Dr. Whitehead, I apologize for Jim Norton.  Dr. Whitehead, it's ridiculous.  If you want to see what he looks like so you can hate him more, just go to eatabullet.com.  He's already got me in Dutch with Barry Williamstock.  Well, you know what?  If you guys are talking about the websites, tell your listeners to...  Oh, oh.  Tell your listeners.  Now, hold on now.  Sit down and relax.  All right.  I'm relaxed. 
[01:43:00]  Tell your listeners to look at this website.  Okay.  It's www.drwhitehead.com.  Oh.  You got pictures of the procedure?  Drwhitehead.com.  All right.  You've got pictures of before and afterwards.  You do.  And everybody will understand what we're able to do.  Drwhitehead.com.  Ah!  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:43:30]  You can't.  Why?  You can see what happened.  Is this guy Norton again?  We've got to get rid of him.  I know.  We're trying.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, but those are two different...  Look.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No, that's a...  I think the second one is more delicious and appetizing.  Are you guys pulling up my website now?  Yeah, we're looking at it now.  Yes, we are looking at the before and after shots.  I want to see the widening pictures.  That's what I want to see.  But it's going to be very hard to get to these pictures because people are now pounding the website. 
[01:44:00]  Doc, you are going to get so many hits on your website.  Yeah.  Well, you know, we send out packages to everybody that contacts us.  Packages.  It's got a lot of information.  It's a big one.  Yeah.  I like a wide and long one.  Well, it's froze up now, see, and your website getting pounded.  Yeah.  Tom has a question.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, you got a question for the good doctor?  Tom? 
[01:44:30]  Hello?  Yeah, speak, you jackass.  Tom.  Tom.  Talk.  Talk.  You.  Yeah, yeah.  You're saying hello like a moron.  What's your name?  Dr. Whitehead.  Hold on.  What's your name?  John.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Sorry, man.  Hey, Dr. Whitehead, if surrounding the mule with dead skin makes it larger, wouldn't Jeffrey  Dahmer have the largest slung in the world?  No.  What type of world?  This is serious.  Dr. Whitehead, I apologize.  We'll get rid of him, too. 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  Goodbye, Tom, John, whatever your name is.  This is a serious conversation.  Yeah.  And we don't appreciate questions like that.  Well, let me go to Scott.  He has a question for the good doctor.  Scott?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Um, yeah, if you put all this...  Good question, now.  What's your name?  That is Scott.  Scott.  This guy, Scott, deserves a medal.  Scott, listen to me carefully, all right?  You listening?  Yeah, I got you.  Remember what I told you? 
[01:45:30]  There's a word because...  Oh, the member wider.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yep.  Talking about the member.  Okay, there's a few different techniques.  Yeah.  The one technique that does do that at times, at times, is the fat injection.  Where fat is taken by needle and...  Or member.  Well, with a member.  And instead of doing that...  Do you have Alzheimer's?  Can I ask you one more question?  No, I haven't answered this one.  He's not done yet.  I haven't answered it. 
[01:46:00]  Forget it.  We got the member.  If you inject it with fat, sometimes too much fat can be put in.  That's not the technique that I consider the best.  That's just the opposite of being drunk, where you get drunk and then inject it into fat.  The surgeon would inject it.  The surgeon would not be drunk.  Right.  Now, with the graft technique, with the dermal matrix graft from the cadaver, which is the best...  Yes.  You will not have any disproportion. 
[01:46:30]  That's what we call it.  There's no disproportion between the head...  Disproportion.  ...between the head...  Right.  ...and the member.  Right.  Listen, we got so many questions coming in, Doc.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, you got a serious question for Dr. Whitehead.  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Doctor, I was wondering if you could...  Do you do anything with the other part of the area, which we like to call, and we will  continue calling, the yam bag?  Yeah, he wants his yam bag.  Okay.  You want to talk about the yam bag and the gonad. 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  That's not something that I take care of.  Oh, no?  You might, if you look very difficult...  I mean, you can look.  There is a surgeon in Florida that does put...  He puts what around them?  They are caps.  Like hats?  Caps.  Well, okay.  You can say like a cap around the testicle to make it wider and bigger.  Right.  A little baseball cap type thing?  The surgery does exist.  I do not do it. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  That's interesting.  Ow.  I am really getting a bad feeling.  And if somebody is interested in that, all they have to do is call me and I'll give  you his phone number.  All right.  Sounds fun.  Joe has a serious question for you.  Joe?  You have a question for Dr. Whitehead?  Yeah.  I want to know if he taste tests every member he does.  All right.  Enough, Joe.  Joe, Dr. Whitehead, we apologize.  Don't apologize. 
[01:48:00]  We'll just get rid of him.  Some of our listeners...  Yeah, it looked like it was a legit question and he kind of tricked us there a little bit.  Smarten up, Joe.  That wasn't what he had written down as we screened the calls, Dr. Whitehead.  You understand how this goes with a radio live program like this.  We can't tell exactly what the people are going to ask when they call up.  So, indeed, we do apologize.  Yes.  You know what?  Steve looks like he has a serious question.  Steve, you have a question for Dr. Whitehead.  Yeah, Dr. Whitehead.  This procedure...  Wait, wait. 
[01:48:30]  Dr. Whitehead, you still there?  I'm here.  Yes.  All right.  Steve, please.  A good question, please.  Yeah, I'm very interested in this procedure.  I just have one question.  Yes.  After you're done donating the tissue from the cadaver, can I meet the cadaver to throw it  a quick one to thank it?  Say it again.  I want to bang the cadaver.  Is my way of thanking it for donating the tissue to my schlong?  Oh, good question.  That's a great question.  I'm sorry.  I can't even come close to answering that.  Again?  Oh, my God.  Why do we get these callers? 
[01:49:00]  Well, I like the way he clarified it when he rephrased it.  It was kind of impressive in a way.  Well, Jim looks like he's going to get us back on the right track.  Finally, I can read what this man is going to ask, and that's a legitimate question.  Yes, Jim, a question for Dr. Whitehead.  Yeah, Dr. Whitehead, I wanted to know if you could make my member into the shape of a  triangle.  All right.  Kind of like just a triangle.  That isn't what you were going to ask something else, and I am getting very upset now.  You guys are embarrassing us.  It would be interesting for a circus sideshow. 
[01:49:30]  Very, very funny, Jim.  Is there any type of shapes you could do with this procedure there, Dr. Whitehead?  We make it into it.  Believe it or not, we try to reproduce the exact shape you have.  You want to make it bigger?  That's all.  We're not going to change the shape.  We're going to make it nice and cylindrical so it looks just larger.  Ugh, Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up?  Not much.  Dr. Whitehead, I want to thank you.  I had this procedure done.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:50:00]  I had the skin of a cadaver made to have my member made whiter.  Oh, nice.  Congrats.  I want to thank you for this.  How'd it work out for you?  Great.  If I could steal Norton's best line now, it's big and meaty and lovable like Mitch Green's  face.  And, Doctor, let me ask you a question.  Um, how many times have you seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre?  Would you say that again, please?  Why would you ask that, Joe?  Well, let's find out.  Well, my girlfriend now calls my member Leather Junk. 
[01:50:30]  Uh, Doc, nothing happens after time goes by that affects down there.  This is time-tested.  That skin won't dry up and look like beef jerky?  Okay.  That's a fair question.  Whoever asked it.  That's, uh, Anthony.  I'm, uh, the one that tries to keep this show on an even keel.  Anthony, you're the main man, okay?  Thank you, Dr. Whitehead.  I'm glad you asked a good question.  Hey, guys?  Uh, yes, Joe.  One more quick one.  I'm sorry.  No, Joe.  Let me get an answer to this one.  I know, Dr. Whitehead.  Anthony. 
[01:51:00]  My friend wants to have the procedure done also.  All right.  Um, do you, Dr. Whitehead, do any preliminary oral examinations?  Anthony, I'm going to answer your question, okay?  Thank you, Dr. Whitehead.  Please hang up on that, uh, caller.  Take care, gentlemen.  That caller.  Thank you, Joe.  All right.  Yes, uh, Dr. Whitehead.  Anthony, the technique that I'm talking about, which I do exclusively and have been using  it only for the last four years, that's the only technique I use, and I've used other  techniques from the past.  I'm talking about the allograft dermal matrix graft. 
[01:51:30]  That's what I was talking about.  That seems, yeah, we're talking about the same things, so we're on the same page.  That's been used now for four years for this application.  It seems that the graft dimensions do not change.  If it does change, and let's assume that the average person gets about 30%, so that's about  a one-inch increase in circumference.  Yeah.  Over a period of time, they might lose 10% or 20% of that one inch.  Um, silently.  So it seems to be very satisfactory. 
[01:52:00]  It seems to be durable.  It seems to be permanent up to approximately four years.  So I'm very happy about it, and so are my guys.  All right.  Are you there, Anthony?  Hello?  He can't hear us right now.  He can't at all.  We'll get at least another hello, Adam.  Another hello.  Come on, try.  He hasn't given the number out. 
[01:52:30]  Hello?  He's got to stay on the line.  Oh, he slammed that phone down.  Wow, he's angry.  He actually was talking with his junkie.  He has a prehensile junk, which you can buy from him also.  He puts a monkey tail in there, and you can swing from a tree.  We'll buy it.  Greg, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  I wanted to ask the doctor.  I told him that I was a patient of his last year, and I'm a black man, and I went to a 
[01:53:00]  nude beach.  I was just wondering, how do I get, when I do the backstroke, how do I get people to stop  yelling shark?  That would have been a great question.  Hey, Rick, what do you say you get the good doctor?  No, no, no, no, no, I am not calling that man.  I think he'll call us back.  No way.  Yeah, he'll call us back.  His technique of making it bigger is actually a lot better than mine.  I would just cut fat off my meat, like when I was eating, and just tape it to my mule. 
[01:53:30]  Just duct tape it.  Oh, God, you know, he gives a website out that has more man junk on it than any gay  porno site.  It should be yummy.  And no one would know.  Yummymouthful.com.  I'm kidding.  Froyer's here with his abs and his chin.  Strapping young college boy.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I just want to be with a man who'll ignore me and take me for granted and who's only  pretending to be interested in who I am and what I think, so I can get in twice, too. 
[01:54:00]  Dirty girls who love you.  Opie and Anthony.  You know where a guy can get a rub and a tug around here?  Anthony.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Great.  Hey, Steve, how does it feel to get sloppy seconds?  Ah!  You didn't have the balls to do it until we did.  That's why you're the worst program director in America.  See, people, that's why we played it. 
[01:54:30]  Effie, what's up?  What's going on, O.A.?  Hey.  Yeah, I was just...  Okay, good.  All right, so K-Rock just played the new Korn songs, claiming they had the first place.  They were so, so happy.  And I was crushing their little dreams in my mind, because I heard it first on O&A.  It's just funny, because they put so much...  They had to openly lie to their listeners.  Yeah.  Because they got embarrassed by us once again.  Yeah.  Oh, they were calling it a brand new premiere. 
[01:55:00]  We were so excited, so excited to have the first place.  We had the world premiere of the new Korn song.  And exactly what we said would happen, happened.  Guarantee they taped it right off our show.  Yeah.  You could probably hear Norton in the background.  All right, Effie.  Thanks a lot, boys.  You rule.  Bye.  The funny thing is, like, I don't...  I could care less who plays anything first.  Like, it's so stupid.  I just love getting...  I just knew it pisses them off.  I just love getting under his skin. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Because he has no balls.  His station blows.  It doesn't get any ratings outside morning drive.  You could tell him that tonight.  He F's with us behind the scenes like you wouldn't believe.  Right.  And then tells the big bosses, no, we're one big happy family.  I want to see them succeed.  I'll help them out with music acts and stuff.  No one's buying your lies anymore, Steve.  It's going to be a very uncomfortable soiree if you keep this line of speech up, Opie. 
[01:56:00]  Your station blows.  You, my friend, don't have any balls.  None whatsoever.  Douchebag.  I think you guys are more...  Opie's ready to go.  Yeah.  You guys are more of a...  Opie's scrappy.  I think you guys are more of a night show.  Yeah.  I think you're a night show for me.  Yeah.  Steve, you are uncomfortable.  Pop his ass.  It's the next celebrity boxing tournament.  Yes.  Me, Opie and Steve Kingston from K-Rock.  I hope he wears platform shoes so I can hit him in the head. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  Now, see, that's just low.  That's a low blow.  That's what I would be getting from him.  Leave the man alone.  He's a good Lord of the Rings.  No matter what, everyone knows we played the corn song first.  And it pisses you off.  Oh, it annoys.  That's the only reason they're playing.  I guarantee this.  It's the only reason they're playing it over there is because we played it already.  So they had to do something.  Which gold record did you break today? 
[01:57:00]  Was it the Creed one?  Hi, Colin.  I had a funny little news thing I wanted to mention.  What's that, Jimmy?  Oh, well, that Michael J. Fox has a drinking problem.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's all you have today?  I thought it was the Daryl Strawberry thing.  No.  The reason he was kicked out.  Well, Michael J. Fox is drinking.  Yeah.  And they said that apparently what happened was he never drank, but he was at all these 
[01:57:30]  parties and they would just put different stuff in his shaky hand and say, Mitch, they're  stupid.  You're horrible.  It's not bad, right?  I just wrote that.  Very good.  Thanks, Matt.  I don't know why they had to call him stupid at the end of that.  Yeah.  I didn't have enough faith in the joke.  Not him, but.  Oh, you didn't have enough faith in the jokes?  Great, without the stupid.  Did you see the Daryl Strawberry thing?  The story?  Why he was re-arrested?  He was having sex. 
[01:58:00]  In the rehab.  He was screwing a woman in the closet.  In the closet?  Yeah, that's what I heard.  He had sex with her, like, in a closet.  Because you've got to hide in those places.  There's no sex.  They're very strict.  As a matter of fact, some of the rules he broke, shaving his head.  That's like a rule that they have in place there.  Why the hell would they prevent you from shaving your head?  Something about image changing, because I remember when I was in rehab, they made a guy  shave his beard.  Did you go into rehab? 
[01:58:30]  When I was 17, I was a troubled dude.  What did they make you do?  I couldn't.  Did they let me wear my hat?  They wanted me to go to a place with a psychiatrist, because I always wear hats.  Yeah.  I almost was thrown out of school for it, permanently.  Wearing hats?  Yeah.  What was the mental thing that they said?  I hated my hair.  I'd cowl it.  That's why I wear it.  I used to put a little brown paint on my hair.  Did they put this whole thing on it, like it was some big psychological thing, and meanwhile,  you just didn't like your hair?  It was a nightmare.  You wouldn't stop wearing hats.  That's why they eventually sent him to yeshiva to solve the problem.  You know what's weird?  Daryl Strawberry went into the closet in rehab, and Norton came out of the closet in rehab. 
[01:59:00]  You know, I really resent that comment, and it's not true.  And why no comments about Daryl's wife, who has stood by him through all this, and now...  Poor gal.  I know.  Well, maybe this is the last straw.  Well, it's like I said the other day when this happened.  That's going to be that post-headlomer.  He dies, by the way.  The last straw.  The last straw.  Well, the whole thing they did the other day, because out on Long Island, I guess,  some guy went into a church and shot the father in there and shot a parishioner, 
[01:59:30]  and they said, mass murder, because it was during the mass he was getting.  It's like, all right, do you have to have the catchy friggin' Clark Kent Lois Lane headline?  Is it always appropriate?  The Jimmy Olsen headline?  Mass murder.  Get right on that, Kent.  Great Caesar's ghost.  I think voice ghost writes for those headlines.  Kent will go with mass murder. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, Mary, you know, moving around all the big words on the front page.  That one works.  Well, it is a tabloid.  I mean, technically, tabloids are expected to do that.  The post?  Yeah.  Yeah, the post is a tabloid.  Hey, you want to play Q's new song?  Q's new song for St. Patty's Day, right?  Yeah, there's a new rule with the Q songs.  He has to make fun of all races.  Is that the rule?  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Who does he usually make fun of?  Just Negroes?  Well, usually.  Well, I imagine, when we played Imagine, that kind of got into everything. 
[02:00:30]  And the Italians were in there.  I could not get that out of my head this morning, I swear to you.  I woke up and I started singing.  But it was just, you may call me a scumbag.  Right.  How come Q has to only make fun of everybody now?  I mean, does Paul Mooney make fun of anyone but white people?  All of a sudden, no.  Yeah.  Yeah, you told him.  Yeah.  Jim, I said that just to save our asses.  I could care less.  All right. 
[02:01:00]  You want to play the Imagine song again?  Oh, that was the line that was stuck in my head.  Imagine, there's no scary darkies.  That was the one that got me.  Yeah, we got to play Imagine now.  That just shows how the world has changed, that Italians actually say there's scary darkies.  Right.  They used to not be scared of them at all.  That was their one charming quality.  But this, well, because it's a little taste of Q, before we play his St. Paddy's tune.  So it might give you a little idea of what he's all about.  Yeah, the St. Paddy's is very similar to the Imagine song. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  Exactly.  We all know what Q is about.  The thematically sound.  We all know what Q is about.  I mean, please.  The guy, he's pretty much the same theme through all of his songs.  Colin, you ready for this?  Sure.  Gets a little rough.  A little rough.  You know what?  If it gets too bad, I'll just go outside and waste.  This was our...  I'll fan myself.  This was our runner-up.  I think I'm getting a touch of the vapors. 
[02:02:00]  This was our runner-up for the most offensive song contest that we ran.  You may ask, why don't we play the winner?  We cannot.  We can't even possess a tape of the winning song.  The winner is Dr. Whitehead.  Not saying remember.  That bastard.  Dumping out left and right.  We'll have to play that someday.  Unedited.  Old goody two-shoes down there.  Oh, please.  Sweater-wearing company man.  I like Dr. Whitehead's accent.  It was like a soap opera doctor.  Yes, well, I'll tell you. 
[02:02:30]  I believe the problem is in the ligament.  We must cut it.  Rick, Monica, let me help you with that.  Scott deserves a medal for that question.  I don't know whether to cut your mule or star in North by Northwest.  Little James Mason humor.  We're really stupid.  That's not an age joke.  It's all my stupid critics who write me hate mail without signing your real names, you dirtbags.  Are we going to stop reading the Internet?  Stop reading your email.  I mean my own email.  I don't mind hate mail, but sign your name. 
[02:03:00]  Have some courage.  Stop.  They're trying to get to you, and now they win.  No, no, no.  Just sign your name.  See, they win.  They don't win.  I don't mind what they write.  Just write your name.  You know my name.  I should know yours.  We hug, we kiss, we laugh together.  Don't let them get to you.  Maybe you go first.  All right.  Here's a...  We're going to play this again.  Why not?  A little touch of what Q is all about.  It's offensive.  It's what Q does.  Who are we not to play it?  By the end of the song, he makes fun of everyone.  Yeah.  If you could get past the beginning of the hump. 
[02:03:30]  It starts off a little rough.  Hey, Opie, sounds like this guy's an equal opportunity offender.  There you go.  You know, we're equal opportunity offenders.  Yeah, that's the way out of it.  Well, you've got to look at it like if you can't laugh at yourself.  Oh, right?  I actually saw the dot, dot, dot come out of Jim Norton's mouth when he said that, too.  All right.  It's a Q.  And then we'll play his St. Paddy's Day tune.  Oh, here we go.  Which is the same as this, only to Irish music. 
[02:04:00]  Buckle in.  Just imagine.  Buckle in.  Literally.  Literally.  Me, you forget about it.  Imagine there's no freaking niggas.  Imagine there ain't no freaking jiggle bulls, no moulin' yams, and no spokes.  There ain't no big scary darkies running around out there. 
[02:04:30]  And of course, no freaking Arabs, no Hindus, no Spics, and no freaking gooks.  Imagine nothing but freaking Italians every freaking way you go.  Come on, it would be great, eh?  Imagine there's no homos.  I hate those little fudge-packing Nancy boy pricks. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Every time I see one, I want to beat him in the freaking head.  You know what I mean?  Then I'll rip his heart out, cut off his freaking little d***.  Imagine all the finookias just dropping dead from freaking AIDS.  Oh, God.  You know what?  You might call me a scumbag.  I don't care. 
[02:05:30]  But I hate those freaking kind of people.  You know what I mean?  I'm going to go upstairs and get a freaking shotgun.  Yeah, I know a couple of moulin' yams fags that need to get whacked.  Imagine.  There's no quibbles.  And none of those three-legged little freaks running around the floor look like frigging chimps. 
[02:06:00]  And Mono and I hate those goddamn freaking handicapped parking spaces.  Christ.  I want to kill those goddamn little wheelchair gimps.  Imagine taking all the retards.  Send them out on the PQE.  That would be a pretty sight, huh?  But you know what?  You may say I'm a scumbag.  You will call me every name in the book. 
[02:06:30]  I don't give a flying freak.  You know what I mean?  Because it pisses me off.  I'm going to take a freaking shotgun.  I'm going to go out.  And I'm going to whack me a couple of lesbian, midget, Mexican, overweight, fat, wheelchair bitches.  Wow, can you feel the love now?  What's the name of that song?  Hip, hip, hooray?  Oh, god damn.  That was the runner-up of the most offensive song contest. 
[02:07:00]  Well, I think he was actually commenting on intolerance throughout the song.  Exactly.  Wasn't it so out there that it almost comes back full around to making a statement on how awful it is?  Some people go, so right, they're left.  Exactly.  And I think this is the...  This is the...  Well, isn't that a nice song?  Miss McGillicuddy. 
[02:07:30]  So, your husband's a pig, isn't he?  Who wrote the most offensive song?  God.  That was Q, I believe.  Who was it?  Who wrote I'm Horny for Little Girls?  That was him.  Oh.  I don't know.  That was my favorite song ever.  Yeah, who wrote that one?  Baby, yeah.  We can't even say the title of the song.  It's so offensive.  We cannot say it.  I never knew there were baby rappers, though.  Yeah, well, that's what it was.  I think that song should have been the 520 spot instead of Dr. Whitehead. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, we made a mistake with Dr. Whitehead.  Well, we got the new one from Q.  All right, let's play the new one from Q.  So, it's a St. Paddy's Day song.  Hey, don't you know?  What do you do, what, Colin, for St. Paddy's Day?  Oh, I get out there in my green and just march up and down Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn by myself.  Oh, yeah, by yourself in Brooklyn.  I go up by...  Fifth Avenue.  Where's the parade?  They've never invited me to the parade.  It's really annoying.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I think you should be in there. 
[02:08:30]  I'm like an Irish, you know, I'm like an outlaw in my own land.  I'm like a mainstay of the Irish community in New York, though.  I like to think so, yeah.  Yeah, and then they diss you like that.  Diss, if I may use a term like that.  I'll just be a grand marshal.  Yeah.  All right.  Nothing.  Let's play the Q song.  Damn.  First thing.  Q is St. Paddy.  Oh, that was Fuel.  Okay, Fuel was the guy that wrote Baby Rapper.  Here we go.  Oh, I love being an Irishman. 
[02:09:00]  I drink all day long.  I look just like a bulldog with a tiny little schlong.  I love to beat up Arabs and niggers, raps and jules.  There we go.  And if you're queer, I'll finish my beer and beat the hell out of you.  Everyone knows the Irish are as dumb as they can be.  They drive their car to the local bar and they always have to pee.  We all know that a toilet is a Mickey's favorite room.  So grab me two potatoes and I'll whistle you a tune. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, I love being an Irishman.  I drink all day long.  I look just like a bulldog with a tiny little schlong.  I like to beat up Arabs and niggers, raps and jules.  And if you're queer, I'll finish my beer and beat the hell out of you.  We all know that a Mickey likes to scrap and fight.  They'll take it to the finish.  There they be wrong or right.  Me mother was a boxer. 
[02:10:00]  Me father was a drunk.  And what could be worse than the Irish curse?  Me wee bit little junk.  Oh, I love being an Irishman.  I drink all day long.  I look just like a bulldog with a tiny little schlong.  I like to beat up Arabs and niggers, raps and jules.  And if you're queer, I'll finish my beer and beat the hell out of you.  And if you're queer, I'll finish my beer and beat the hell out of you.  And if you're queer, I'll finish my beer and beat the hell out of you. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  That was a feel-good song.  Well, that makes me just want to drink some green beer and some corned beef and cabbage.  That was a real toe-tapper.  Wasn't it?  There's the theme song for Southie.  You're going to see, you know, you walk into an Irish pub on St. Paddy's Day.  You go to the jukebox and see all the green song selections that they put in there.  Puff the Magic Dragon, Donny Boy.  And I think that one's going to be right there with it. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  And all the guys at the bar singing.  Oh, that was funny.  That was our 520 bit.  That was it.  That's, yeah.  That was it right there.  Claude.  Another classic racist song from Q.  Hey, Claude, what's up?  Hey, you guys should put out a greatest hits album of most offensive songs and, like,  donate the proceeds to, I don't know, the Ku Klux Klan.  Oh, yeah.  Not the Ku Klux Klan.  Yeah, that's what we got to do.  Sure.  We thought about putting out a CD because we got some, that was one of the best bits we  ever did, the most offensive song contest. 
[02:11:30]  But considering we just got a cease and desist from the company that was going to put our  CD out.  Oh, yeah.  Oops.  We always crap what we eat, man.  We always shoot ourselves in the foot.  I forgot.  Yeah, that's right.  Sony was going to help us put out a CD.  Yeah, and today we just F'd them.  We spun them around and shoved it so hard.  All right.  Tom C. from Jersey, best song ever.  So there's, uh, the review is piling in.  It's already up on foundrymusic.com. 
[02:12:00]  Yep.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We can do that.  And we'll continue.  Oh, actually, let's go to the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, I want to send a big f*** you out there.  Any stripper out there that thinks that anyone finds them interesting as to what they have  to say.  So take yourself and your fake f*** and hop in your Mitsubishi Eclipse and run yourself  off the f***ing road.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to the Jersey Net fans. 
[02:12:30]  Talk about a lame crowd.  You guys are about as much fun as a Westfart in church.  Next message.  Yeah, there's a big F.U.  to a certain little fat little oink that don't know how to shut the hell up.  All day at work, you sit there, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee,  and then when you fix it, you know, yeah, yeah, I'm the greatest of it.  And then when you break it after three months' worth of fixing something.  Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.  Yeah, you know why everybody can't stand it?  You shut the hell up, you freaking f***.  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to send a big F.U. 
[02:13:00]  out to my brother-in-law for introducing me to your sister.  What the f*** were you thinking, bro?  She's a b***h, she's a c***h, she wrecked my life.  I hate you and I hate her.  Thank you.  End of message.  Good evening, ignorant pigs.  Put down your crackpipes and your beer balls and pay attention.  I'm a virgin.  Hooray!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A four-hour parade of moot.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:30]  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  You said you were going to come down for what's that, to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I'm Stinky Garrett. 
[02:14:00]  That's what made us laugh in the back office today.  You have to loop it now, Ant.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I'm Stinky.  I'm Garrett Stinky.  Garrett.  Hi.  This is...  Hi, it's Garrett Stinky.  Hi, it's Garrett Stinky.  Hi, it's Garrett Stinky.  This dot stems from when Stinky was calling girls back to come back on the show, because 
[02:14:30]  we had him set up to come down and do some horrid thing, I'm sure.  And we wanted Stinky to call and confirm that the girls were showing up.  So we're in the back office, and Stinky is making the calls, and I'm listening, and I'm  laughing my ass off.  Because he goes...  He can't say, hi, this is Stinky.  But if he says Garrett, I guess they won't know who it is.  So he goes, hi, this is Garrett Stinky.  It's like Garrett Stinky.  Hi, it's Garrett Stinky.  Where's that young go-getter, Garrett Stinky? 
[02:15:00]  Send him up to my office.  Well, I'm making you a vice president.  Hey, Stinky.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, GS.  Come on up for lunch, GS.  How do you feel about a corner office and a key to the executive ward?  And a company car, Garrett Stinky.  Have you met my daughter?  Steve, what's going on?  Steve.  Hello?  Hello.  What's up, bro?  Hey, how you guys doing?  What's up, man?  You're calling from Cali?  Yeah, I'm calling from California, man.  A friend of mine turned me on to your radio station. 
[02:15:30]  Ah.  And I got to tell you, you guys are a freaking riot, man.  Thanks, man.  There's no radio station out here like this at all.  Where are you?  And I tell you, every day when I'm at work, I turn on you guys from noon to four, and there's  not a time that I don't stop laughing.  Where are we on noon to four?  No, no, that's three to seven.  San Francisco?  I think it's coming out of San Francisco, but it's on an AM station.  Ah, that AM.  Amplitude modulation.  I love it.  That awful, awful AM station.  Isn't that great? 
[02:16:00]  That technology is still in use.  Hey, Steve, is it true when we go to commercial, they play like country songs and stuff?  All right.  They kind of play a little bit of everything.  Oh, great.  You know, oldies, country, a little bit, you know.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thanks, Steve.  Spread the word, because that's the only way we're going to make this work, I think.  Hey, you guys have a good one, man.  My phone's going to cut out.  I'll probably try to call you again sometime.  All right, man.  Well, uh...  Oh, did you hang up on the street?  That's great.  AM, you guys are going to get all the grandparents listening.  That's terrific.  AM. 
[02:16:30]  Is there...  Why is that even existing still?  Isn't that like, you know, flash, story, Hindenburg crashes in Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Because I miss has to do his cuckoo clock noise.  Our listeners don't even know that AM exists.  What is...  Like, why?  Anyone under the age of 40 doesn't even know AM exists.  AM.  AM.  They think it's the morning portion of their...  Yeah.  It's the morning for their cuckoo clock radio.  There's like certain technology that was cutting edge at some time, and then as the years went 
[02:17:00]  by, it kind of falls to the wayside because new stuff comes up.  It's not like we're still using crockpots.  Right, or the horse and buggy thing, you know?  Or...  He came up with a car, and now it's kind of nostalgic.  Or beta.  Beta Max.  The Sony Beta Max.  No.  8-Tracks.  8-Track.  Another thing.  You don't see still 8-Track.  We got to put it out on 8-Track, too.  Laser disc.  Ah, the laser disc.  Look who's talking technology. 
[02:17:30]  Jim Norton.  I happen to have a very impressive DVD collection with a few tranny movies.  I enjoy a good 8-Track every once in a while, especially like a Yes album where it stops  in the middle of the line.  It fades down, and it goes, this big solenoid the size of a truck brake, like, bam, slams  in your dashboard, and then it fades up into the second half of Free Bird.  I was about to hear the Steve Howe solo.  What happened?  That's actually probably better than the Yes song, Untouched. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, really?  I like Yes.  You don't like Yes.  No, Roundabout stinks.  Yes had its day.  It was very good pop music.  First of all, the album covers were great.  They folded out in actually 10 flaps.  Nice.  For cleaning.  For cleaning your weed bales.  You could have...  For cleaning your barrel.  You put a bale on some chicken wire, you stand on it, and you unfold one Yes album.  On a huge Yes album where you could have 15 Mexicans standing in front of it, cleaning 
[02:18:30]  your pot, rolling it.  Here's 50 cents.  Buy yourself a taco.  Get out of my house.  Hey.  And what other album covers could you then airbrush on the side of a 40-conoline van to look cool?  With a mushroom window.  Mushroom bubble window.  Spoiler on the back just in case that van gets up to 280, 300 miles an hour.  Hey, Anthony, I just realized something.  Yeah.  You're not Colin.  No, I'm not.  Hey, wait a minute.  No, I'm not.  Colin Quint.  What kind of show do we run around here?  I thought I was talking to Colin.  I'm possessed. 
[02:19:00]  I thought he bought some sucretes, and we were talking to him.  Oh, not me.  Oh, not me.  Like, what happened to Colin, and who are you?  It's Paul.  Louis Black.  Louis.  It's Paul Mercurio.  It's Paul Mercurio.  You guys suck.  Did we call you in from the bullpen or something?  You did.  You said, get over here now.  Colin's leaving.  Colin was like, I gotta leave.  Colin threw 100.  I'm taping the show.  Colin threw 100 pitches, and we had to go to the bullpen, I guess. 
[02:19:30]  I gotta go.  Paul Mercurio.  I gotta go.  We're doing a thing.  Paul Mercurio's the closer tonight on the O.P. Anthony show.  Yeah.  Can you get it right?  What am I?  The closer.  Can we get, say, Emmy Award winner.  Emmy Award winner.  Oh, thank you very much.  It is the Emmy Award winning Paul Mercurio.  Six months at least.  Nice.  And he's our closer.  Emmy Award.  Great.  Colin rules, man.  Hey, we got a real big Yes fan that wants in here.  John, what's up?  What the hell is Norton's problem? 
[02:20:00]  Yes?  Roundabout sucks?  John, I've just never...  I recognize that Yes is very popular.  What the hell are you talking about?  Close to the Edge.  Topographic Oceans.  Relayer.  Those are the best freaking rock albums in the world.  John, get a hold of yourself, duster driver, mullet wearer.  I'm just saying, I'm not a Yes fan.  I don't drive a Ford.  What about...  Excuse me.  More distance around all the time.  I love that song.  That song rocks.  It's around about...  I like the fish better in that song. 
[02:20:30]  What's that?  Actually, like the bass solo at the end.  The fish.  That's actually the best one.  You know what?  John, we've learned on the show, you can't really discuss bands because everyone gets  pissed off if you say something bad about their band.  Oh, I know.  I know.  We'll discuss it all morning.  You're on the queue.  I know, because we're not cute.  Thank you.  I was the best thing at WNW.  Yeah, so you brought me some Tony Bennett.  What's wrong with that?  Tony Bennett?  Yeah.  You brought in Tony Bennett?  All right. 
[02:21:00]  Here, guys.  Your news.  Thank you, man.  Yes.  Thank you, Chachi.  All right.  Yes, songs.  People are very defensive about music.  Blue Oyster Cult.  Blue Oyster Cult.  Godzilla.  They were one of my favorite bands ever.  Sit in the back of an Oldsmobile, and it goes from one...  Godzilla, Godzilla, Godzilla, Godzilla.  Godzilla, Godzilla, Godzilla.  One speaker to another.  Oh, great.  The more pot you smoke, the faster it went.  Absolutely.  The louder it got in one ear than the other.  You freak out, rip your clothes off, and run down Clay Pits Road.  I understand.  Clay Pits Road. 
[02:21:30]  Hey.  Good long, Al.  Local reference.  Local reference.  Oh, very nice.  We haven't done many local references today.  No, that's true.  We did mention Southie.  Yeah.  Southie we mentioned a lot.  We mentioned Columbus.  And it's talking about drinking.  We mentioned the juice in Austin.  The other AM station we're on.  Here's good judgment.  Get really stoned and drunk in a car.  Drive around and with an ounce of pot in the car, get in a car chase with someone that  turns out to be an undercover cop.  Oh, interesting.  Well, my friend was, his father was chief of police of the town. 
[02:22:00]  Ah, so you got out of that one.  And you're like, you, Jim Dodd's son, I can't arrest you.  Get back in the car.  Ah, you darn kids.  Oh, yes.  Silly.  Get out of here.  They took the pot every time.  Oh, they took the pot.  Back in the, back in the, uh, the day.  Yeah.  As we call it, um, the day.  I'm it.  It.  Yes?  Um, we have to take another break.  Damn it.  Because we went long with stuff today.  I was kind of getting into something here.  Oh, I know.  I had a couple of things.  Getting into the. 
[02:22:30]  I, I understand, but we have to take a break.  The whole thing.  Plus, Ken wants to walk us down to that little shindig at 648.  648?  648 is when we, uh, go to a, uh, bar somewhere in Manhattan.  Oh, this is going to be.  This is going to be so much fun.  And, uh, glare across the room at people we, uh, despise.  This is going to be so much fun.  You guys love it.  Well, Opie, you were just chatting about the gentleman.  One of the gentlemen that'll be there.  You guys love it.  You're the center of attention at these things.  Because you're the heavy hitters in the street.  No, you don't understand. 
[02:23:00]  When you've got to look at, at a Steve Kingston making believe he's your friend.  When you've got to look at, at, at, uh, the, uh, Tom Chiasano, who just, you know, just hates you.  So, it's going to be a fun, fun time, Opie.  And then they.  I want to sit in the corner.  And then they make believe we're one big happy family.  Captain and Coke.  And just berate.  And just berate.  And berate people.  As he did everything he could to get us out of the company and get us fired.  Uh-huh.  And then he, uh, thinks we're not, we're, we're not smart.  Yeah, but he fires because he loves. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Hey, and, um, a Stephen Lynch song as we go to break.  Because we'll give him a little more here.  And then we'll come back and we'll have a problem.  The bowling one?  Well, uh.  No, huh?  The pub one.  Because it's, I like the pub one.  This is an old traditional Irish song.  And it's, uh, it's usually passed down from, from father to son.  Uh, when the boy's on the verge of manhood.  And it's called Down to the Old Pub Instead.  Ah.  And I'd like to play it for you tonight.  Ah.  Lad, it's your duty to find your lass with childbearing hips and a pink suplass. 
[02:24:00]  And make her your wife and lover with love so true.  Now some rivers run high, some rivers run low.  When her river runs red, then she's starting her flow.  And it's called menstruation.  Here's what it means to you.  You will notice her bloomers are spotty at first. 
[02:24:30]  Stand back, her ovarian dam's gonna burst.  Son, don't be afraid.  It's a natural thing.  Just wad up some cotton and hand her a string.  And put the old linens on top of the bed.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  Hundreds of years old.  That's why bloomers.  Aye.  Aye.  She'll retain her water, her breasts will be tender. 
[02:25:00]  Say something nice and you're sure to offend her.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  She'll want to make love if you do.  You're a fool.  You'll only end up with a bloody old tool.  Now get out of the house, go down to the old pub instead.  Here she'll want you to sample the fruit of her loins.  But son, it'll taste like some old rusty coins.  So turn off the light and take off your hat and drop to your knees.  Say a prayer to St. Pat that'll give you the strength to get out of the bed. 
[02:25:30]  And for Ireland's sake, go down to the old pub instead.  I feel a solo coming on.  Oh, really?  Perhaps right here, Anthony.  Very good.  Now the pub is the place where the lads are a-meeting.  When the moon is full and the gals are a-bleeding.  The Catholic, the Protestant, even the pagan. 
[02:26:00]  The pub is the place when your lady is ragging.  So drink of your pint, boys, and thank your shamrocks.  That as menfolk, we don't have to bleed from our c*** and that we can escape from the lady in red.  And get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  Down to the old pub instead.  Down to the old pub.  Nice.  Thank you, my lads.  Thank you so much.  That is your glass. 
[02:26:30]  I need good to drink.  You did your part well.  Thank you.  Nice fluting.  Nice fluting and nice bleeping.

[02:29:30]  the what happened was the cemetery workers removed the corpse for burial seven hours later yeah they  realized the woman had only been dead a very short time now i don't know why cemetery workers were  checking out this woman's body cemetery workers were able to i don't think she's been dead that long i  could not get this in that far if she's been dead  put the shovel down this one is not dead 
[02:30:00]  i'm getting some secretion that should not be happening i can tell by this secretion from dust  do you imply are you are the old double knuckle chest if she screams she ain't dead  from her skin color she looked dead but i could tell she's warm on the inside  but doctor don't you think you should check her i'd have to bend over for that  that would take work and i could tell by the skin color she's dead 
[02:30:30]  don't call me a doctor i'm a male nurse there's a difference  she would make a fine blue lampshade  there you go you killed somebody's grandma good job doc  i wonder if we declared her dead because she was screaming zell the white angel  the white angel's here  we can't be certain at this point whether the woman died of cold in the morgue but it seems quite likely 
[02:31:00]  and this is why we decided to investigate the doctor  wow good good move  it's germany for you thank you  new ways to kill people with that little tidbit  leave it to the germans  uh...  uh... seamus what's up  hey what's going on i want to do what have you learned today  okay  i learned that thanks to dr whitehead  even after you're dead a party you still can get laid  yes yeah that's true  that you can't say penis  you know you can in that context sir
