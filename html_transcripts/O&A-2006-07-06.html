<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The July 6th, 2006, Opie and Anthony Show, hosted by Opie and Anthony with Jim Norton, began with their usual vulgar self-introductions, acknowledging the crew, including Hurricane Ben and Martini Steve.  A significant portion of the show focused on the negative press they'd received regarding their return to XM Satellite Radio, specifically articles in *The Hollywood Reporter*, *The New York Post* (criticized for its poor printing and late publication), and *Forbes*, detailing how their lawyers "begged" to keep them on air despite strong initial ratings.  They extensively mocked Steve's unspecified bad acting, referencing an unpromotable animated short on their website due to potential pornography.

The hosts then moved on to discussing several news items: Kenneth Lay's death (prompting various conspiracy theories), the absence of public photos of Tom Cruise's newborn baby (leading to speculation about its appearance and a possible faked pregnancy), and a bizarre incident involving a man with electric saws in a NYC subway station.  Listener calls contributed to these discussions, with one caller describing a neighbor's house fire caused by fireworks, prompting reflection on stricter post-9/11 firework regulations and changes in July 4th celebrations.  The segment ended with anticipation for food from the Brooklyn Diner.

The next segment centered around two main topics: a Dateline NBC segment on a child with progeria, and their frustrations with XM Satellite Radio’s website restrictions.  The hosts used darkly comedic and offensive language to mock the child, the Dateline piece, and what they perceived as exploitative ratings-grabbing.  Audio clips from Dateline were played, interspersed with listener calls offering equally tasteless jokes.  Their anger towards XM, specifically an unnamed "Steve," for preventing them from promoting their website and message boards, was repeatedly expressed.  They sarcastically thanked "Steve" for his lack of support, referencing the breakfast delivered by XM from the Brooklyn Diner and Jerry Seinfeld's anticipated appearance there.  Adam Ferrara briefly called in.

A subsequent segment featured Jim Norton's attempts to befriend Michio Kaku, with brainstorming sessions involving absurd suggestions from the hosts and Adam Ferrara, followed by listener feedback.  The bulk of this segment played and mocked clips from Maury Povich's show featuring individuals with unusual phobias (pickles, balloons, birds), with crude jokes and irreverent commentary.  Adam Ferrara remained in the studio.  Listener calls followed, including an insulting caller who quickly hung up, leading to more banter.  The show discussed Howard Stern's time off and an incident involving a couple having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  The segment concluded with more calls and a walk from their studio to the XM broadcast location, involving interactions with street people, jokes about AIDS awareness, and offensive descriptions of an elderly woman.

A heavily offensive segment followed, focusing on a *New York Post* article about Howard Stern's Hamptons party, criticizing Stern's association with wealthy socialites and a neighbor's attempt to block a beach tent permit.  The hosts used highly offensive language to criticize *New York Post* columnist Linda Stasi, focusing on her appearance and review of the Dave Chappelle show.  They played Maury Povich "Phobias" clips (a woman terrified of dogs) with further offensive commentary.  E-Rock's MySpace blog, comparing Mr. T and Chuck Norris, was read aloud.  The hosts expressed their disdain for various authority figures (toll booth attendants, traffic officers) with offensive language, alongside listener calls sharing similar experiences.  Adam Ferrara and Sandy Kane were in studio, with James Brown also mentioned.

The final segment featured a discussion of E-Rock's blog post about a negative movie-going experience with loud Black moviegoers, devolving into racist and homophobic jokes targeting E-Rock, Scott and Todd (rival radio personalities), and others.  John Sterling's Yankees announcing style ("The Milk Man Always Knocks Twice") was mocked.  Scott and Todd’s show, personalities, and HBO show were criticized.  Upcoming events (Jimmy’s Nashville show, a Corn concert) were mentioned.  A caller suggested a "viral video" section for the website, leading to discussion about upload processes and viral video popularity.  Greg Hughes (Opie's actor counterpart) and his apparent apathy towards negative commentary were discussed.  A name analysis bit using a dog breed website was included.  The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion and several calls about Man Cow and an alleged press release about his career.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Opie and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rapid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We eat.  Dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting. 
[00:00:30]  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad. 
[00:01:00]  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  laughing at that the entire week. 
[00:01:30]  Steve's bad acting.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  So am I, Steve.  It's now an animation, too.  Oh.  One of the best animations anyone's ever made.  Show related.  Steve's, uh...  Steve's, uh...  All of his movements fit completely.  All of his movements fit completely.  They're very Steve.  Steve.  When he shoos away his wife from the living room, 
[00:02:00]  and all that moves are his little forefingers.  I'll handle this, honey.  Just...  I don't know if this side of the Opian Anthony show  even knows what we're talking about,  but, uh...  One of our interns  wrote a little production piece  for him and, uh, Steve.  Good old Steve C.  And the acting is just horrific.  Oh, it's awful.  We've been goofing on his acting  for a couple weeks now, 
[00:02:30]  and now there's an animation  done to the whole piece.  You can find it on the website  that we're not allowed to promote.  Because there may be some porn on our website.  Could be.  You search deep enough.  Good luck trying to find that.  Just like any website.  I think if you go to, uh,  Disney's site,  eh, there's porn there somewhere.  Eh, trust me.  There you go.  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony show.  Yes, we are live.  It's, uh... 
[00:03:00]  Uh, July...  Uh...  Oh, what is it?  July 6th.  The 6th.  Because sometimes when we're off,  and then best of,  we'll say we're live,  and then you realize  we're talking about Christmas or something.  Yeah.  So it's July 6th, 2006.  We're here for a couple days,  and then it's the weekend.  That's what we do.  Ah.  A lot of people take this whole week off.  And then the entire month of, uh, August and...  And everything.  Ah, whatever else.  However much time you can get off, the better. 
[00:03:30]  There's something I was trying to...  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  What's...  What's...  No, I'm just annoyed because, uh,  during the break,  a lot of articles came out,  um, on us,  the radio show.  Yeah.  And it was nice to see  that the lawyers of this company  that we work for  did not want to hire us.  Not only didn't want to hire us,  but...  Thanks a lot, Steve.  We heard the terms  begged and begged  not to hire us.  Not just a passing suggestion, 
[00:04:00]  perhaps going up to, uh, Joel  and saying,  you know,  in our opinion,  as lawyers,  we believe perhaps  it wouldn't be best for the company  if these two weren't rehired.  Oh, okay.  I'll take that into consideration.  No, the story,  I quote,  the lawyers begged  and begged.  Like, the next beg  was in italics  and everything.  Like, bold, italic.  Begged and begged 
[00:04:30]  not to hire these two.  Great visionaries.  Ah, lawyers.  We only cost the company  a few million dollars.  That's all.  But the lawyers have no faith.  None.  In the Opie and Anthony show,  they truly believe  we'll blow it up again someday.  Yeah.  That was nice to see, Steve.  Who'd you want to put here?  Thanks a lot, Steve.  Steve in Washington?  What was your suggestion?  Waking up with Whoopi?  Was that it?  We can't catch a break.  It's Joel Hollander.  Joel Hollander is in 
[00:05:00]  The Hollywood Reporter  and all over the place,  you know,  talking about how  this was a great move,  bringing Opie and Anthony back  and the early ratings  are really, really good.  Yeah.  Early signs are great.  And then he has to  talk about how  the lawyers did not  want to hire,  begged him not to hire  the Opie and Anthony show.  Begged and begged.  Do you think they  actually got down  on their knees  and made that  praying thing  with their hands  and crawled slowly  on their knees  and went,  please, please don't.  I beg of you.  Don't hire them, please. 
[00:05:30]  Thanks a lot, Steve.  Holding Joel's leg  while Joel stiff-drags  his leg away?  Yeah, he's like  stiff-dragging.  Now get off my leg.  I know you're begging,  but I need these guys.  Probably because  he didn't want to work.  Yeah.  Steve didn't have to work,  but now that we're back,  he has to work.  He probably has to listen  to every single radio show  we do for CBS radio.  Every show has to put out  all the memos.  Thanks, Steve.  Lawyerly things  that have to be done  when we are of your employee.  Thanks for doing research 
[00:06:00]  to see what the difference is  between the year 2002  and 2006  with the Opie and Anthony show.  Apparently not our ages.  I think that's a good sign  for the show  because if the corporate lawyer  at CBS goes,  oh, these are the guys  for the job,  that means the show stinks.  That's a good point.  You are absolutely right.  That's a good point.  If the corporate lawyers  have thrilled you back,  your show is a bunch of faggots.  Yes.  And also,  even if they're not,  another article came out  in the New York Post. 
[00:06:30]  John Minnelli's article  finally came out.  We were bitching about this  before we went away  for a few days.  Now, once again,  the ratings came out,  you know,  and so far,  so good.  So far, so good.  Yes.  The early ratings  are very, very good  for the Opie and Anthony show,  but we got a long way to go.  We all know that.  But so far,  everyone very, very happy.  And there's been articles  written all over the country  in some fine newspapers.  Yes.  The Washington Post,  the Daily News,  gave us some great exposure,  and it goes on and on, okay?  And then John Minnelli 
[00:07:00]  finally goes,  and he calls us and says,  hey, the Post wants  to do an article on you guys.  The New York Post hates us  for some reason,  but they don't have the balls  to tell us why.  Everyone's hiding  behind their cubicles.  No one will come forward  and say, you know,  why they hate us.  I think it has something  to do with Howard,  to be honest with you.  So then John Minnelli goes,  come on, guys, you know,  and we love John Minnelli.  We go way back with John Minnelli.  Good friend.  And so he writes the article,  and it's a pretty good article,  and then the article 
[00:07:30]  doesn't appear.  It just doesn't appear.  Yeah.  And then finally,  we're on, you know,  a short vacation.  It makes Monday's paper  July 3rd.  Who actually picked up the paper  or went to work on July 3rd?  Obviously,  the Post wanted to bury this story.  Why else would they run it  on July 3rd?  No one buys the newspaper  on July 3rd.  Nobody.  I wish I could see,  you know,  circulation numbers.  It would be a drastic drop 
[00:08:00]  for July 3rd.  No one saw this.  So we get it.  The Post hates us.  And then the picture they use,  it's blurry and out of focus.  Did you pick up one paper,  look,  and then go,  let me get another paper.  This one's blurry.  And then I looked and went,  oh, okay,  they're all blurry.  I've never seen a blurry picture  in a newspaper like this  unless it was a misprint.  Yeah.  I was away,  and someone called me and said,  yeah,  you made the Post today.  July 3rd.  July 3rd. 
[00:08:30]  I think you made it.  I can't quite tell  with that picture.  July 3rd.  Great.  Thank you,  John Minnelli,  and thank you,  New York Post.  Go F yourselves.  And the headline,  never seen this one before,  Radio Days,  with...  Days spelled D-A-Z-E.  You know,  like we're in a daze.  Oh, God.  The originality there  is just beyond anything  I've ever seen.  You know, 
[00:09:00]  they're just the worst.  But they do have a great headline  today in the Post.  You gotta give them credit  when credit is due.  Yeah.  Before they put  Cheeto Lay's coffin  in the grave.  Oh, God.  Check he's in it,  because we all know  he's slimy,  and he's...  He's full of tricks.  He's got some trickery  up his sleeve.  He's the king  of maybe getting out of things.  It's good to know  that the government  can still kill people  when they want.  Yeah.  It's good to know  they can still  put something in your food  to give you 
[00:09:30]  that massive heart attack  while you're on vacation  in...  And where was he?  Colorado?  Aspen.  Aspen, Colorado?  Aspen, Colorado.  The Enron dude  is dead.  Waiting on all  that jail time  he was supposed to get,  and all of a sudden  he disappears  because, uh...  Hey,  who wants a guy  like that rolling over  on some big wigs?  Huh?  Perhaps even  the vice president  of these United States?  Hmm?  That's the conspiracy.  The guy wasn't dead  for a second.  I went to CNN.  I go to the website. 
[00:10:00]  I see that he's dead.  I go,  oh, let me check this out,  you know,  search a few places.  There's already  20 conspiracy theories  on why he's dead,  if he's dead,  how he died,  the fact that he's not dead  at all.  They took him away.  They...  Like, God,  these people work quickly.  Okay.  We're all laughing at Steve.  Well, uh,  what do you think  of his unshaven, uh...  His very boyish...  Jesus, Steve?  You are very boyish looking  without your facial hair.  Why are you dressing  like your animated character now? 
[00:10:30]  You got the red sunglasses  on your head  and everything.  I always had the sunglasses  on my head.  Do you like...  Wait, what do you think  of the new look?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I don't approve  of my own look.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  But I'm sorry.  Did you see the animation?  Yes, I did.  I love the hand motions  of that guy.  Who is it?  Dead fruit virus,  I think?  Put it together.  Well, someday we'll be able  to maybe promote our website  and then a lot of people  can check out the animation  instead of trying to  search it out on their own. 
[00:11:00]  Good luck finding it.  Yeah.  It's on...  I know a lot of people  said it was on  Jim Norton's MySpace page.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  No, it's not.  A lot of fun things.  You're just trying  to get more friends.  No.  To be a popular guy  even on a stupid  MySpace website.  I like being popular.  Oh, by the way,  also, speaking of other articles,  there's a guy that works  for Forbes magazine  that hates our guts, too.  That douche.  What's his name?  Douche.  Levine, is it?  Levine.  Yeah, he's taking stabs at us  in every article  about XM Satellite Radio  for some reason. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Because he's a douche.  And I think the ONA pest  attacked him really bad,  so now he's going to try  to make it a point  to give us a little jab  every freaking article.  The latest is,  have you seen your mention  in Forbes magazine  or the latest article  in Forbes?  Even fans,  and this is the quote,  even fans of XM's  widely popular  Opie and Anthony show  who generally love  to hate Stern  nonetheless seem to talk  about him endlessly.  Huh?  That is just bad reporting.  Do we talk about Howard  from time to time?  Yes.  Do we talk about him 
[00:12:00]  endlessly?  Absolutely not.  When it comes up,  we talk about it.  There's a big,  big difference there.  What's his name?  Can somebody get the name  of the R so we can,  we can,  Greg Levine.  The guy is,  Greg Levine.  Greg Levine from Forbes.  He's a jerk-off.  Yeah,  if the ONA pest  want to have fun  with him,  by all means,  go for it.  Fire a few rounds  over the bow.  They fire,  they send,  fire,  I used your word.  They send them to us too.  Yeah.  And the one about  was kind of well written  and it said,  by the way,  I'm still wishing  your family pancreatic cancer.  It's so inappropriate 
[00:12:30]  and amusing  and I encourage it.  I might have erased it.  Hold on,  let me see if I can find  it really fast.  I don't know  if we're going to find it.  Yeah,  the guy's obviously  got a problem with us.  He's a jerk-off reporter  who's writing  for a boring magazine  who just wants  to get his opinion  out there  but there's no way  to do it  when writing  for that stiff,  dull magazine.  Here it is.  Here's one of the  emails from the past  that was forwarded  to me  because it's one  of the better ones. 
[00:13:00]  Mr. Levine,  you wrote,  as underdog series  prepared for the  much touted  January 2006  arrival of blue  raconteur Howard Stern,  XM supposedly  did some prep as well  running up  stratospheric marketing costs.  A spending spree  would have been  understandable.  Even fans of XM's  wildly popular  Opie and Anthony show  who generally love  to hate Stern  nonetheless  seem to talk about him  endlessly.  That's from his article.  How does that tie  into the story at all  other than the fact  that he's a douche  who's editorializing? 
[00:13:30]  So then this guy,  one of the one-a-pest  continues,  yeah,  almost as much as you  endlessly talk about  Opie and Anthony  every time you write  an article about XM,  usually negatively.  Are you finally  becoming a fan,  Captain Mick?  And I can't say  the word here,  unfortunately.  No.  It's the C word.  Captain Mick's  C word.  Did you finally  catch the virus?  I can't speak  for all pests,  but I talk about  Stern a lot  because I think  he's a boring,  overpaid hack.  It is mind-blowing  that Sirius is paying 
[00:14:00]  him $630 million  as to the shareholder's  lawsuit against blah,  blah, blah.  It just continues.  Actually,  this is one of the more  serious O&A pests  getting into it.  All right,  whatever.  It continues.  The pests are on it.  The pests,  what he might even  be talking about  is the fact that  their message board  is in a battle  and has been  over with  Stern's message board  and they go back  and forth.  However much 
[00:14:30]  they talk about it,  it's because  the other side  is doing the same thing  and they get into  these matches.  You can't mention  what they are,  but they're  matches.  I hate Greg Levine.  He's just a douche.  Getting back to  good old  Cheeto Lay's.  The sudden death  of Enron founder  Kenneth Lay  is raising  complicated  and legal  and financial  questions.  Lay,  who would have  been sentenced  this fall  on his fraud  and conspiracy  convictions, 
[00:15:00]  still face  civil lawsuits  in connection  with the collapse  of the energy  company.  The 64-year-old Lay  died of a heart  attack in Colorado  Wednesday.  Diddy.  There you go.  And what's the  conspiracy theories?  There's a few of them.  One is that he's  not dead at all.  That the government  has taken him out,  going to set him up,  sort of a la  witness protection  program thing.  Fake body  goes in the coffin,  coffin in the ground.  He's off the hook.  Who's the lucky sap 
[00:15:30]  that gets to be  the fake body?  Just some Joe Schmo  going to work one day  and they realize,  hey, this guy looks  a lot like  Kenneth Lay.  Just throw him in there.  No one's going to look.  Doesn't matter.  Some housewife  in the Midwest  somewhere saying,  hey, my husband's  missing.  Shut up, lady.  Shut up.  And because of all  the things he did,  good things for  certain people,  they've rewarded him  by getting him  past all this legal  mumbo-jumbo.  The other one  is the other side 
[00:16:00]  of the spectrum.  Too much out there.  He knows too much.  Can roll over  on some pretty  heavyweight people.  Some are saying  the vice president  of the United States.  So,  he's got to go.  Or maybe just  the pressure  and the stress.  So,  one of those  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  ding,  kind of got in there.  He's an Aspen.  Put a little something.  Sprinkles a little something.  Maybe it was raining  and a guy with an umbrella 
[00:16:30]  passes by him  and like hits him  in the leg  with the umbrella.  It just feels like,  oh,  guy hit me in the leg.  Meanwhile,  he's put some poison  in his system.  That could be it.  And now,  he's dead.  He's dead.  Well,  it's the big story today.  We'll see how it plays out.  He's dead.  He's dead in the papers.  He's dead.  See?  Speaking of Mission Impossible,  you know,  they still haven't seen  Tom Cruise's baby.  No one's seen it yet?  No one has seen  Tom Cruise's baby.  You think it's not  now another conspiracy theory? 
[00:17:00]  Well,  they either gave birth  to a...  It's in Tom Lee's grave.  They either gave birth  to a waterhead.  Hen leg.  A waterhead.  Or they,  or the whole thing  was fake.  Just waterhead.  Because they've been saying  that this pregnancy  was fake.  That's horrible.  What?  A waterhead.  Well,  if you're Tom Cruise,  you can't all of a sudden  like call us weekly  and say,  hey,  time to get the  pictures of the newborn. 
[00:17:30]  Big waterhead.  Well,  what do you think?  Something's going on.  Well,  who else has had  children and showed it?  Angelina.  Paltrow and Angelina  and Brad.  Angelina and Brad  have shown their baby.  I don't know why  we care so much.  Why wouldn't they show it?  It's just going to look  like every other stupid baby.  Just a dumb fat face.  They haven't shown it  because something is going on.  It's in the paper today.  Oh,  this isn't the one.  Darn it.  Darn it.  Did I just say...  Oh,  boy. 
[00:18:00]  I got to find it.  That could be something,  though.  What?  If they're not showing the baby.  It could be a waterhead.  Or they're going to sell  the pictures from  Monumental Manicam.  No,  they would have sold them  by now.  Yeah,  they would have done it.  Yeah,  because everyone else  sold the pictures right away  and got their payday.  Every day you wait.  Also,  somebody else might  snap a few pictures  and there goes your money.  Right.  Tricky.  I can't find it.  You know what?  Why don't we take a break  and then we could... 
[00:18:30]  You're thinking  it's just a lifetime of...  Hold on,  Moe Howard  from the Three Stooges  haircuts?  I don't know,  but they're getting  suspicious out there  in Hollywood.  Even the Smiths.  Will Smith,  who I guess is  close friends  with Tom Cruise.  Ooh,  look at this.  More conspiracy theories  coming in.  The baby is black.  There you go.  That could be...  It looks like  Katie Holmes  and Ving Rhames. 
[00:19:00]  Hold on,  I'll find it.  Hold on,  hold on,  I just figured out  where it is.  It could be a little  embarrassing.  I hope it's a black actor  but not like one of the  really good looking guys.  I hope it's like  Delroy Lindo's kid.  The guy that played Tuma.  All right,  here it is.  He's the greatest.  What's the name?  He's in Harlem Nights.  Yeah.  What's the name of the kid?  Suri or...  Suri, right?  Baby Suri Cruise  isn't just playing  hide-and-seek 
[00:19:30]  with the public.  Tom Cruise  and Katie Holmes  have yet to show  off their spawn  to fellow Scientologists.  Ah.  So,  their fellow Scientologists,  John Travolta,  Kelly Preston,  and Lisa Marie Presley  have not seen the baby  and they're starting to think  this is a little strange.  Even good pals  Will and Jada Pinkett Smith  supposedly have not met  the newborn  despite repeated calls  to Cruise,  reports US Weekly.  Every time,  it's a different excuse.  He's busy  or Kate's not feeling well.  He's busy.  Is that a source?  The Smiths think  it's so weird. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Something is going on  with Tom Cruise  and his baby there.  Poor Katie and her.  Actually,  poor family.  Imagine being Katie Holmes  like parents.  She's in a hit show  at one point  doing pretty good.  You know,  they're reaping the profits  and then all of a sudden  she marries his nut job  as a kid  that no one can ever see now.  Oof.  Why would they  fake the pregnancy?  They're like,  I don't get it.  Like for what?  Well,  there was conspiracy theories  on the internet  as far as that goes too 
[00:20:30]  that it was a fake pregnancy.  Has he ever had  one of his own?  I think they've just  been adopted.  Yeah.  Nick in Pennsylvania,  what's up?  Hey,  what's up guys?  Hey.  I don't think  she ever actually  was pregnant  and then they adopted  and now they got to wait  for the photographs  to catch up  to the baby's age.  You know,  they can't show pictures  of a 10-month-old  only two months  after she had it.  Wow,  look at that.  Yeah,  but won't that,  that'll never like  even out.  Yeah,  but you won't notice 
[00:21:00]  the difference  between 11 months  and 18 months  where you'd notice  the difference  between two months  and 12 months.  So they're going to have  to fake the kid's age  its whole life?  That's right.  That's it, guys.  No, they don't even  have to fake the kid's age.  I get what this guy's saying.  Like,  I mean,  they don't have the baby yet.  Oh, right.  Okay.  So not delivered yet?  Not delivered yet.  Need good white baby?  Where did that guy go?  Who's an expert on adoption?  Can you adopt a newborn 
[00:21:30]  or do you have to wait?  It seems like  Rosie O'Donnell can  like at the top of a hat.  Then that theory  doesn't even make sense.  Maybe they're looking  for one that really  looks like the two of them.  Something like that.  How would you tell, though?  I bet you that they wanted  one that they had  to look at for a few months  and make sure  nothing was wrong.  They're probably having  a battery of tests  run on it.  Yeah.  Make sure that it doesn't  embarrass them in six months.  Yeah, it gets older.  I think they had, like,  the grand plan  and something went  horribly wrong.  Horribly amiss.  And now they don't know  what to do.  In the laboratory.  Oh, man.  In the laboratory 
[00:22:00]  of Scientology.  Maybe some lady  agreed to have  their kid for them  and she backed out  at the last minute  so they don't have  any kids to show.  Or they got to pay  a boatloads of money  or else she's going  to start yapping.  Right.  Or maybe that they  had the kid  and it's healthy  and they're both  just, like,  really private about that  and don't let their  baby exposed  to some medium monkey  and are just  being protective.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Maybe they gave birth  to a progeria kid.  I picture 20 bodies  in Kenley's coffin.  The mother of the  Cruz child. 
[00:22:30]  She'll be shoved  in there.  Maybe the child  itself if something  was wrong.  I think it was a  healthy, happy baby  and they're just  being protective.  That's a nice way  to think, Jimmy.  I like Tom.  No, they really want  to show the world  that they have a kid.  He's hunky.  Because of the whole  Tom Cruise,  is he or is he not?  Well, did they  with, uh,  they had baby  with Nicole,  like, what a bunch  of fat housewives  we are, but I'm  actually interested  in this.  Yep, yep, yep,  yep, yep, yep,  yep.  Well, I'm interested  in this because I  think he's pulling  one over on the  entire world.  That's the only, 
[00:23:00]  I could give a crap  if someone in  Hollywood gives  birth to a kid.  When they had baby,  when they had baby  with Nicole Kidman,  did they show it  right away if anybody  remembers or did they  pull the same  malarkey?  Those were adopted  kids.  Oh, okay.  They have two or  three adopted kids  together.  This is his first  real child that  he's had on his  own.  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  What's going on  there?  Think he's  shooting blanks?  Could be.  I don't know.  Why aren't they  showing the kid?  Why aren't they  showing the kid?  Yeah, why not?  Show us the kid.  I bet you. 
[00:23:30]  All right, we  should take our  first break.  I see an amazing  display being set up  in front of us here.  It's like a wedding.  The Brooklyn Diner  is bringing us food,  which is just  fantastic.  Which is really,  really good.  That's why we're  still talking.  It's not that we  care about this show.  We want the food  to be ready when  we get off the air  so we can just  eat immediately.  Are you saying  chop, chop?  Let's go.  Don't say that.  Great Brooklyn Diner.  I'm so hungry right  now.  Go eat some food.  You know what they  do at restaurants  when you go chop, 
[00:24:00]  chop?  The Brooklyn Diner  on 57th Street  and 7th Avenue.  We eat there all  the time.  So does Jerry  Seinfeld.  Yes, one of the  many celebrities.  Next time you're  in New York, go to  the Brooklyn Diner.  For your chance  to see Jerry  Seinfeld.  And Jerry likes  it when he's  eating, if you  walk up and  just shake his  hand.  That's right.  I think if someone  tried that with  Seinfeld, he'd  actually throw his  food on them.  Of course.  It's the greatest.  When he's got a  forkful ready to 
[00:24:30]  go in his mouth.  He could be the  most honest guy I've  ever seen in  person.  Yeah.  I saw him do this  one time.  There was a guy, a  tourist wanted a  picture with him.  And he goes, okay.  And the guy put his  arm around Jerry and  goes, we don't know  each other.  We don't need to  touch.  And the guy, a  shamefully took his  arm off him.  We don't know each  other.  Where did that come  from, the arm around  you when you don't  even know the guy?  He took the picture,  but he didn't want  that guy's filthy  tourist hands.  We don't know each  other.  I'm rich, you idiot. 
[00:25:00]  Exactly.  Take your non-250  million dollars fingers  off my shoulder.  Let's go to Pat in  Boston.  Pat, what's up?  Loved him for that.  I think that Cruz  baby might have the  mouth heartbees.  Oh, you think so?  I remember a lot of  that was popping up  on Katie's face in a  lot of pictures right  after they hooked up.  Yeah, there was a lot.  Just had a mouthful  of the herp.  A lot of swamp action  around the lips.  So you think maybe  the herp worked its  way down where the  kid's got to do the  water slide ride and  then maybe got some  of that on him? 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  Something is definitely  going on.  Let's go to Mike.  What's up?  Hey, man.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey, I got this  visual of Ken Lay  when you were talking  about the conspiracy.  Yeah.  Seeing him in gold  paint in a gladiator  outfit running around  like in JFK being  chased by the  assassin.  With Clay Shaw and  David Ferry chasing  him around in like  Victorian wigs.  Man, it's an enigma  trapped in a riddle.  My favorite Pesci 
[00:26:00]  performance ever  has Paul's wig.  It's brilliant.  I got cancer of the  neck.  I've had it for years.  Who gets cancer of  the neck?  Stupid David Ferry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Hey, can we play that  production piece over  here?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It's worth playing  again.  Oh, it's horrible.  Can we have a copy of  that laying around?  Because this side of  the opening.  I've not heard it  yet.  Is it dirty?  Huh?  Oh, it's dirty?  There's a couple of  filthy parts on it.  Oh, forget it.  We're not going to  play it, edit it. 
[00:26:30]  Forget it.  That'll be one for  the XMers.  We'll just play the  little sound clips that  we can play from time  to time.  Yes, the bad acting  from Steve.  Slappable, smooth  shaven face.  And if you want to  see the animation,  just try to figure out  what our website is,  and it's there.  Yeah.  All right, it's the  O.P. and Anthony  spreading across America.  Shut up, Kenny.  We're back with the  O.P. and Anthony  show, the O.N.A.  virus spreading across  America.  1-866-313-FREE is our  phone number.  I got to tell you,  XM Satellite Radio has  upped the breakfast ante 
[00:27:00]  big time.  Wow.  If you've been following  what's been going on  with this program,  we've got some nice  ratings in so far.  Yes.  From some fine cities  like Philly and Boston  and Cleveland and  Pittsburgh and West Palm  Beach.  West Palm.  Yeah.  And it goes on and on  and on.  And some of these cities  so happy that they got  us breakfast.  Philly did it.  Boston did it, right?  Yep.  They were the only two,  I believe.  Was there a third?  I'm not. 
[00:27:30]  What?  Cleveland sent us  bagels.  When did Cleveland  send us bagels?  When you threw them  in the garbage.  What?  Remember, Opie?  When you threw them  in the garbage?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks for the bagels.  Forgot about that.  We're fancy.  We need something a  little better than  bagels.  So, XM said,  F that.  I guess they're  very, very happy.  The subs are going  way, way up with 
[00:28:00]  this brand new deal  we made with CBS  Radio.  Yep.  So, the display in  front of us is  just amazing.  The Brooklyn Diner  is in the house  today and they're  going to be making  breakfast for  everybody, including  omelets.  Fresh omelets.  They are amazing.  It is set up like  some type of a  banquet.  This breakfast  will blow away  Boston's breakfast,  Philly's breakfast,  breakfast, and 
[00:28:30]  Cleveland's bagels.  We never understood  the perk of this  deal that was made.  There's one perk.  We really thought  this out, the CBS-XM  partnership with us  being the hub here  and doing well for  both companies, but  we never thought out  the one perk, the  divorced parents  syndrome.  that really, one  side will always  try to impress you  more than the  other.  And they kind of  wage a war like 
[00:29:00]  parents do, you  know.  They get the kid a  new bike, the  father, and then the  mother sees this and  has to do something  nice, and then the  father sees it.  And it's just this  constant battle where  they have to get  something better for  the child.  We are the children  in this.  And each side now  feels they have to  top the other side,  and it puts us in a  great position.  I don't think anyone's  going to top XM as  far as the breakfast  thing goes.  This now is ridiculous.  I mean, unless CBS  buys us a restaurant to  broadcast from and eat 
[00:29:30]  at every day.  We'll see what CBS  comes up with next.  Also, really fast, I  want to thank the  government for  protecting us from  fireworks.  Thank goodness.  Thank you.  Thank you for  protecting us.  Making the July 4th  weekend or whatever.  Celebration.  Yeah.  A complete bore.  Boy, it used to be  something.  I remember block  parties on Long  Island where you  weren't sure if you  were going to live.  You weren't sure if  you were going to go  home with all your 
[00:30:00]  limbs.  You're drinking right  next to you.  What the hell was  what?  Oh, no.  Short round.  Short round.  Like a starburst goes  off in the street.  cars are engulfed in  sparks.  The good old days.  And then in the  paper.  Organized fireworks  suck.  Yeah.  They really do.  In the paper the next  day, pages upon pages  of the fun of lost 
[00:30:30]  limbs on children.  Exactly.  I just couldn't quite  release that M-80  quickly enough for  dad.  He'll never throw a  knuckleball again,  will he?  Right.  Unless he can throw it  with his toes, you  just rarely read about  it anymore.  Learn to type lefty,  you little snot.  Well, they're  protecting us.  They're keeping us  all safe.  So instead, we get  the organized fireworks  that are just boring.  Well, I watched the  big Macy's fireworks 
[00:31:00]  display.  Boring!  On the East River.  Boring!  What a faggot.  Oh.  All right, I believe  James Norton was right  next to me, as was  Than, Danny, at a boat  full of us watching the  fireworks, yelling at  people.  Did he actually go,  ooh!  Yes.  Ooh!  Ooh!  We went, oh!  That's a pretty one!  You don't even know what  they're doing with fireworks  these days.  Who cares?  They're making cubes. 
[00:31:30]  Who cares?  They blow up and it's  a cube, smiley faces  and stars.  Oh, that's just like  having a block party  and you decide, all right,  half of you go across  the street, the other  half stay here.  Let's see what happens.  Of course, that was fun.  Who can forget the  bottle rocket fights?  All that fun stuff.  But the government,  they're out there  protecting us.  Thank you, government.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Did you see the sign  on the expressway for  the past month?  I think it's been there.  Oh, yeah.  Illegal fireworks.  If you're caught with 
[00:32:00]  illegal fireworks,  we take your car.  Not only that,  they want us to  tattletale on our  fellow citizens.  Rats.  Help families full of rats.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  If you see illegal  fireworks, call this  number, blah, blah, blah.  And I seem to remember  when we call the  good old days,  you would be handed  about a month  before the fourth,  you're handed a menu  of what you wanted.  And you would circle,  all right,  I need like 50 M80s.  I need a bunch of these. 
[00:32:30]  I need some of these  rockets.  I need these eight  ounces.  It was always the one  dude in the neighborhood.  Yeah.  And he'd hand out  these menus.  I'm going to the  border, man.  Yeah, he'd hand out  menus.  And you'd circle  everything and hand it  in with some cash.  And then he'd deliver.  You didn't even know  what it did.  It just sounded cool.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Helicopter rocket aerial  bomb.  All right, give me one  of those.  I need that.  And then by the  fourth, before the  fourth, you'd get  these things.  You'd give them the  money.  And everyone on your  block had these  fireworks. 
[00:33:00]  And you'd start  setting them off early.  Like around, you know,  the late June, you'd  start hearing at night  just horrific explosions.  And then the fourth  was just full.  Every neighborhood was  full of explosions of  fireworks.  And why are they  taking the fireworks  out of our hands?  Is it very dangerous?  9-11?  I don't know.  They were kind of  doing it before that.  Like Giuliani was  really cracking down.  No, but like this  year and last year  especially, it's a big  drop off.  I would assume it's  very hard the last  couple of years, 
[00:33:30]  getting it off the  streets.  To transport gunpowder  of any kind in a  truck or any, you  know, because now  they're inspecting  the trucks, like you  said, for 9-11.  So they open up the  back of a truck.  You see a bunch of  fireworks there.  They check for gunpowder.  You know, and they do  that at the airport.  Make sure you don't  have any on your hands  or in your bag or  something like that.  So, yeah, I think  9-11 kind of did a  little something to  it, even though they  were cracking down  before that.  I like they crack  down.  I hate fireworks.  I hate them.  I love it. 
[00:34:00]  So they're making  cubes now?  Yeah, they blow up and  it's a big cube in the  sky.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  I want them to look  like 10-year-old boy's  fingers.  Just blowing apart in  the sky.  We had fun, though.  Wow, that's exciting.  Did everyone go, oh,  my God, did you see  that?  Do you know what a  small part the fireworks  display was for the  whole boat ride that was  there?  It was nothing but a  drunken, babbling poker  game. 
[00:34:30]  On the water.  The way in and the way  out.  And then once we got  back to the dock,  someone decided it was  a much better idea to  not just go home, but  to drive into Manhattan  and play foosball.  Play foosball?  Dude.  It sounded like a  great idea at the  time.  Hey, by the way,  someone's very confused  on the instant feedback.  A Cuban in the sky.  Race to Manhattan. 
[00:35:00]  A Cuban, no.  A cube.  All right, so I hope  you had a great 4th of  July.  It was.  We were actually  organized fireworks.  We were actually racing  to Manhattan.  Yeah.  Drunk off our asses.  Wonderful.  Wonderful choices that  are made.  Oh, my God.  What an idiot.  Bill from Waterford.  Opie, they're taking  the fireworks out of  our hands because the  government doesn't want  the fireworks to take  off our hands.  Oh, clever.  Clever. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Are we ready for the  psycho of the day?  Yeah, this guy.  Have you heard this one  yet, Jimmy?  I have not.  Every freaking day  there's just a lunatic  loose on the streets  of New York.  Lunatic homeless guy  usually.  And I don't know,  a couple of years back  the fad was taking a  big cobblestone.  For some reason,  in New York,  in certain areas,  there's still  cobblestones.  I think they find it  charming.  Yeah.  Isn't it nice when you  go from a paved road  to  to cobblestones? 
[00:36:00]  When you're walking,  you're constantly  snapping your ankles.  Yeah, on something  that was good for a  street in the 1700s.  But, yeah,  occasionally these  things will loosen up  and homeless people  find it perfect to bash  innocent people over  the head with.  I got to back up  Walter from Virginia  upset.  It's so I don't have  to pay for your  uninsured ass when you  blow your hand off.  Man!  And then, uh,  Baz,  Baz, I guess.  My brother-in-law  set off some great  fireworks for about 
[00:36:30]  three hours Tuesday  night here on Long  Island.  No cops,  no limbs lost.  Looks like we beat  the man.  Man!  Nice.  Good for you.  All right, so, yeah,  the lunatic of the day.  Instead of getting  the fireworks off the  streets, why don't we  get the homeless off  the streets?  Can we just round them  up?  They're out there just  losing their minds.  Our top story this  morning, a man armed  with the saw going  on a rampage in a  subway station in  Manhattan.  A rampage?  What is this,  Grand Theft Auto? 
[00:37:00]  Are we living Grand  Theft Auto at this  point in New York  City?  Yeah, I'm up to the  saws, man.  I found the saws.  Just on a rampage  with a saw.  A rampage.  It is the year 2006.  There shouldn't be any  rampages going on  with a saw.  Do you have to  complete a task before  you get the saws?  Because I know you  get the small arms  first, but you've got  to work up to the  saws in the subway.  Our top story this 
[00:37:30]  morning, a man armed  with a saw going on a  rampage in a subway  station in Manhattan.  Fox 5's Andre  Hepkins on the scene  in Morningside Heights  right now.  Andre, what happened  here?  Lucy, police here are  still trying to figure  out just what happened.  The information keeps  coming in.  It is developing.  I can tell you there's  a heavy police presence  here at 110th Street  and Broadway centered  around that subway stop.  It's the downtown stop  on the one line.  We understand that  downstairs around  3.30, a man was  standing by the choking  booth and then another 
[00:38:00]  man armed with two,  we're hearing now,  two electric saws  running, tried to rob  that man and then  stabbed that man with  one of those electric  saws.  We understand the victim  was taken to the  hospital.  His assailant got away  and dumped those  electric saws in a  garbage can around the  corner.  Police have that building  roped off as well as  this subway stop.  Again, this information  is still coming in.  Police are talking to  witnesses downstairs.  There is a witness that  was taken away in a  police van just a short 
[00:38:30]  time ago.  We were trying to talk  to him earlier, but the  police took him away and  then took him away in  that van.  So this information is  still developing.  We're still on top of  the story.  We'll try to get you  more information as it  becomes available.  He hijacked or carjacked  a cab and he's now with  a hooker getting his  power back up.  Boy, that is  something.  He's not stopping for  any red lights.  No.  He's just going through  all the lights. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, this happens in  Manhattan and we just go  about our lives and we  just laugh.  What are you going to  do?  A lot of other places  in the country.  Not one, but two  electric saws.  Why not?  And then he stabs you  with the saw.  Yeah, kind of jabs you  with it, I guess, while  it's running, I don't  know.  A lot of other cities,  they'd be petrified that  that happened.  We're just like, eh,  cool story.  And none of the day.  Nice.  It just made us laugh,  that's all.  Let's say hi to Jimmy  in Pennsylvania. 
[00:39:30]  Jimmy, what's going on?  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah, the fireworks  thing is all about  taking away your  freedoms, man.  Yeah, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, you won't be  able to buy a  firecracker in 10  more years.  Good.  You're not supposed  to be able to even  buy one now.  They're loud and  irritating.  You don't like the  loud noise?  I just hate the  whole idea of it.  You're like a  nervous dog.  No, they...  Like the poor guy  that's got to deal  with that in his 
[00:40:00]  house every day.  That's Jimmy.  I just hate them.  They just irritate  me the way everybody  lines up on the FDR  to look at them.  No, that's the  organized fireworks.  Even the unorganized  ones just make noise.  It's the unorganized.  You don't even know  where the thing's  going to fly.  Some guy throws it.  Look!  Kaboom!  Give me a light!  You don't like the  helicopters?  No, I don't.  I love those.  I like helicopters  if people lit them  and stuck them in 
[00:40:30]  their own mouths.  You never had  bottle rocket fights  when you were  growing up?  No.  The only time I ever  used bottle rockets  was I was tripping  on mescaline with my  friend and we aimed  them at the highway  at cars that were  coming.  Fantastic.  So there you go.  There you go.  You've enjoyed the  fireworks.  Good, clean fun.  Exactly.  We all know fireworks  are illegal, but so we  also have illegal  immigration.  We just kind of look  the other way.  Let us look the other  way.  Let us blow off a few  fireworks every 4th of  July.  Who's looking?  And not have your 
[00:41:00]  neighbor tattling on  you.  So is the old  neighbor ratting you  out.  Hello, police.  There are fireworks next  door.  Let's say hi to Dan  in Boston.  Dan.  Hey, what's up,  boys?  Hello, Dan.  How you guys doing?  Good.  You guys reported it  was electric saws.  Yeah.  That cycle had.  Well, why couldn't  you just back up so  the saws unplugged  from the wall?  They couldn't hurt you  then.  Yeah, I'm starting to  think perhaps the news.  See, the story is a lot  more interesting if the 
[00:41:30]  saws are running, but  they didn't say that.  But they also didn't say  that they were plugged  in or not plugged in.  Like, they're making it  sound like he's chasing  people with running  saws, which is really  creepy.  Yeah.  So they're kind of  leaving things out.  I would believe here  that they're not plugged  in.  He just chased people  around and poked them.  But that story is  boring.  Yeah, but that's  boring.  It's a lot more fun if  they're running and arms  are flying off.  I'll be completely honest  with you because they  didn't give enough info.  I'm thinking some guy, 
[00:42:00]  two chainsaws, just  rocking.  I didn't even pay  attention to the  electric part.  I'm just thinking two  chainsaws running and  this maniac is stabbing  people.  That's what I want to  imagine.  It was the chainsaw  massacre happening in  the subways of  Manhattan.  In GTA, you take off  a head and you see it  just spout the blood.  That's what I'm  picturing.  Not a little jab in  the side.  Oh, yeah, here's where  I got a bruise from the  saw hitting me.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:42:30]  Let's say hi to  George in Colorado.  George.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I was talking  about the fireworks.  This year was a great  year.  They got people across  the street from me  whose house I just  people who I just  fucking despise anyhow.  Their house got  burned down by  fireworks this year.  Wait, your neighbor's  house is burned down?  Yeah, the house right  across the street from  me.  About 830 Tuesday night,  my wife's like, hey,  I smelled smoke.  And I went and looked  outside and there was  flames shooting out of  the roof.  And the fire department  determined yesterday it  was caused by fireworks. 
[00:43:00]  Well, something hit the  roof.  That always got me a  little nervous when  you're setting off  fireworks and one of  the big rockets will  come down and it's  still kind of on fire  and it hits someone's  roof.  You know, Anthony,  your family that was  visiting you from  Colorado, I'm sure  they're aware that we've  got like extreme fire  danger out here this  year.  So this is like one of  about two dozen houses  in Colorado that  burned from fireworks.  It's very dry out  there.  It's global warming.  Just ask Steve.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we're all  going to burn up.  Later, boys. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Nick  in Massachusetts.  Nick.  Yeah, you know  Anthony, I'll be.  What's up, Nick?  And Nick.  I remember you guys  back when you were  up there.  Spent in the Marine  Corps for a while.  Been overseas for a  while and I heard you  guys were back on the  radio.  I just wanted to  welcome you guys back.  Thanks.  We're being heard on  WBCN up there in  Boston.  So did we.  We did two years  over there.  We did a couple  years.  In the service.  You guys, I remember  one thing you guys  did is you guys had 
[00:44:00]  two, a couple have  sex in a church.  Oh, yeah.  That was us.  No one heard about  that one.  Yeah, that was us.  We'll not bring that  up.  Thanks for reminding  me for today because  I haven't gone a day  in two and a half  years without someone  reminding me.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Two and a half.  Let's try four.  Close to four years  without someone  reminding me every  single day.  Stay serious.  Thank you, Nick.  I thought today would  be the day that  someone wouldn't  remind me.  But no, Nick had to  remind me.  Thanks, Nick.  Had to throw in a  little reminder of 
[00:44:30]  why the lawyers  begged and begged  and begged that we  not be hired here.  Thanks, Steve in  Washington.  Thanks for having  some faith in us.  Little faith.  Thanks a lot, Steve.  God.  Because we're just like  the Opie and Anthony  of 2002, you idiot.  Yes, Steve.  Do some research,  will you?  Even people that  commit crimes get  paroled after a while.  I wonder if he made  the phone call begging  CBS Radio not to hire  us.  What did he say?  Don't do it.  What was the quote  again?  They begged.  Begged me. 
[00:45:00]  It was begged,  comma, italics,  bold.  Begged me not to hire  these guys.  And I bet you Steve  was making that phone  call from the Opie  and Anthony wing of  his fine house down  there in Washington.  Yeah.  Remember that, Steve?  Remember how we were  at Mel, who's going  away party?  Fareed's.  Fareed's.  Fareed's going away  party and you were  thanking us for all  the trouble.  He was thanking us  because when they have  to litigate, which we  caused a lot of, he  gets paid.  He got paid a lot of 
[00:45:30]  money and he actually  thanked us at Fareed's  going away party for the  wing he was building,  the Opie and Anthony  wing, because of all  the business he got.  because of our  stupidity.  The same Steve saying  do not rehire these  guys.  That was the  conversation you were  getting at the party.  I was getting a  different one.  We ever tell that  story over here?  Is that Fareed's  ex?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I guess they're  going through a little  thing.  Wow.  A little divorce or  something.  Oofah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think everybody had  been tipping a few 
[00:46:00]  that night at that  party.  Fareed's ex was not a  fan of Mel Carman.  Not a fan of Mel.  Not a fan of Howard  Stern.  And Mel was there.  And had no problem  telling us that Mel  Carman was pussy whipped.  And Mel's wife was  there or girl or  whatever at the time,  right?  Wife?  I don't know, man.  All I know is will you  shut up?  I don't know.  Why?  They're all old  enemies.  Fareed's wife was just  going off.  And she talked like  Samantha kind of from  Sex and the City. 
[00:46:30]  She was an older  cougar.  Well, and she kind of  got up, you know,  kind of got up to me  and went, well, let me  tell you about Mel  Carman.  Can I just cut in?  She was literally two  to three inches away  from our lips.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like real close.  I thought she was  going to kiss us.  I thought there was  going to be like some  real inside stuff that  we could use.  Something like that.  It's like, that guy  is so whipped.  His wife, I think his  wife, he can't do  anything without 
[00:47:00]  checking with her  first.  And let me tell you,  she's a class A one  bitch.  Just going on and  on.  And meanwhile, like the  people she's talking  about and she's being  kind of loud are like  near feet away.  And I'm trying to like  move further away from  the people so I'm not  involved in this  conversation.  Guilt by association,  you know?  Yeah.  It doesn't matter  that I'm being told  this and not saying  anything.  If I'm seen being  told this, I'm gone.  Oh, was that  horrific? 
[00:47:30]  It was very  uncomfortable for  everybody.  That was the day I  introduced myself to  Mal because I'd never  met him.  And that's how he was  a big fan of this  program.  Because I said,  hello.  I said, I know he  didn't know I was.  I'm like, I'm Jim.  I'm on the Opie and  Anthony show.  And he goes, oh, how  are those guys?  I go, they're good.  He goes, tell him I  said hi.  And he walked away.  Yeah.  Tell him I said hi.  All right.  That's how he was.  I used to pass him.  He used to walk right  down 57th all the time.  And I'd see him all the  time.  And I'd be like, hey, 
[00:48:00]  Mel.  And he'd kind of look at  me like he didn't know  who I was and just go,  hey.  Hey.  Like you would anyone  on the street.  Right.  Like I just read the  latest column in Forbes  about him and said hi.  Had no clue who I was.  That's where we were.  That was our existence.  And he liked it that way,  by the way.  He knows now.  Oh, yeah.  He absolutely knows now.  I think he knows now  because when he sees us  now, what does he do?  He averts his eyes and  turns the corner.  He will not make eye  contact with us. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  The Brooklyn Diner is here.  Oh, am I smelling  wonderful things?  The omelets are going  to be made in moments,  right?  Alexis.  Oh, yeah.  Alexis does a great job  running the Brooklyn Diner  on 57th Street and  7th Avenue.  He takes care of us  when we go in there.  I want to lick  the chef's fingers.  Starving.  Hey, is Jerry Seinfeld  going to be in the  Brooklyn Diner today?  Yeah.  He will be?  What time?  Of course.  10 o'clock.  10 o'clock?  Usually around 10 o'clock,  Jerry Seinfeld, 
[00:49:00]  if you want to watch  him eat some eggs.  I'm not even kidding you.  I've seen Joe Torrey in there.  It's a great place to...  Jerry pops in there.  To do some star sightings.  That's the only way  CBS, by the way,  could top this.  XM got us  the Brooklyn Diner.  The only way CBS  could top this  is if you rehire  the Brooklyn Diner  and you hire Jerry  to eat breakfast in here  so we can look at him.  Right.  That's right.  Good luck, CBS.  Just stare at him.  That's what Jerry likes  too when he's in  the Brooklyn Diner.  Not only if you say hello  but slide into the booth  like Kramer.  Yeah.  Like they did in the 
[00:49:30]  diner scenes in Seinfeld  and just start carrying  on a conversation  about like the ketchup  or something.  He loves that.  Well, Colin and Seinfeld  are friends  and Colin told me  a story how he got  Seinfeld one time  because his doorman,  he said to the doorman,  you're like,  Jerry loves it  when you do show quotes  to him.  Oh, he hates.  So this idiot door guy  is just yelling quotes  in Seinfeld  as they walk away.  What an ass.  Of course, Colin,  I'm sure he's pleased  just punching himself.  Of course he is.  All right, we'll take a break. 
[00:50:00]  It's the One Virus  spreading across America.  That's right.  Here, check it out  the Opie and Anthony show.  The One Virus  spreading across America.  Really fast.  I think tomorrow's the day  we give away five IMAX, right?  I think tomorrow's the day, Steve.  Oh, I guess it's too late  to get your entries in.  Technically.  I guess if you got an entry,  you could still sneak it in  under the wire.  Send us your 30-second 
[00:50:30]  or less production piece  about the Opie and Anthony show.  And tomorrow,  we're going to select  the best five entries.  You can win the new IMAX.

[00:51:00]  Testing long-range missiles  and no one gives a crap.  Yeah.  Like Jimmy said  during the break,  it's very true.  They just want attention.  There's a little kid  throwing a tantrum.  Kim Jong-il.  Everybody's going to do  a fire and missile at California.  A, it would never hit.  It's stupid.  But it's probably  that old stupid  Soviet technology,  those ICBMs  that were great  in like 1986.  You hear they tested one  and they wanted  to fly it over Japan?  Yeah.  And after 30 or 40 seconds,  it just...  It just died.  Into the water.  It petered out. 
[00:51:30]  It petered out.  They don't have the...  They don't have the money,  really.  And the people,  the smarts over there,  because anybody  that has a brain  kind of leaves  or tries to anyway.  Dies trying.  But then they got  that missile.  What's it called?  The Tapa something dong?  It sounds...  It sounds very phallic,  their missile.  It's a very phallic-sounding,  dopey-sounding missile.  But it's not that phallic. 
[00:52:00]  No.  It needs some of that Viagra.  It does,  because it cannot quite  reach out and touch  where it is supposed.  And they're saying  it could hit the United States.  Could it?  Alaska.  Could it?  They're talking about,  like, Alaska.  Could hit California  if they flew it over  and just drop it  out of a helicopter.  Yeah.  North Korea stinks.  Does anyone care  about Alaska?  No.  Getting hit by a missile?  I hope they do hit it  so we can start  drilling for oil there.  I care about Alaska.  Do ya?  I want to go on  one of those cruises 
[00:52:30]  and I want to check out  icebergs.  Ooh, the icebergs falling  and maybe a well  coming up for a little air.  That's what I want to do.  Let me tell you  about a cruise ship.  It's meant for the heat.  Those big deck chairs,  the huge decks  with all the chairs.  What are you going to do  when it's freezing cold?  Oh, by the way,  Lead Belly,  the Chinese are coming,  the Chinese are coming.  I truly believe that,  but I'm talking more  of the, uh, uh,  uh, you know,  uh, the, um, 
[00:53:00]  uh, Koreans,  they're, uh, uh.  They look like Kim Jong-il.  Yeah.  That guy.  Their eyes are too round.  Yeah, a little too round,  but not round.  Those are the ones  I'm not scared of.  The other ones.  They're like round,  like, um,  like old cartoon guys  with the round glasses.  Right, right.  So they make it look  real big and round.  Right, right.  Yet, um, very, um,  uh, uh, just slit-like.  Not so round.  And then when they 
[00:53:30]  take the glasses off  to clean them,  then they kind of look  like scary.  I'm, yeah.  I'm more worried about  the not so round Chinese.  Is that it?  You have a whole hierarchy?  Love to see the chart you have.  Oh, I got all sorts of charts.  All right.  Uh, you guys want to talk  about, uh, progeria?  One of our favorite topics.  Was it on Maury?  It was on Dateline.  Dateline?  Dateline did their  progeria kid story.  Dateline's biting off  a Maury now.  Please tell me they're 
[00:54:00]  setting up these pedophiles  with progeria kids.  You thought you were  hooking up with an  eight-year-old.  I'm 79.  Yeah, you thought you  were hooking up with  an 80-year-old man.  What happened?  Well, this is why we  like to play this audio.  Mm-hmm.  We play it in the way  it was meant to be played.  To be goofed on.  Dateline will,  we'll play it straight.  Dateline will play, uh,  we'll play the progeria  kid story and, and, uh,  make it very serious.  But the reality is 
[00:54:30]  they're throwing this  on TV to get big ratings  because it's a freak show.  And we're watching  because it's a freak show.  Dateline is becoming  more and more of that  type of television.  It used to be, uh,  very news-oriented.  Not anymore.  And for the people  that don't agree with us,  go screw.  Whoa, like that.  This is the,  this is the new freak show.  We're not allowed to have  freak shows anymore  out there when we're  walking on a freaking  boardwalk somewhere.  So now TV has, uh,  has, uh,  has taken the torch  and they're running  with it.  Uh, oh my God.  Anthony from Virginia  is an idiot. 
[00:55:00]  Hmm.  Look at what he,  look at what he says.  Anthony.  Yes.  I am embarrassed  to have the same name  as you.  Uh, go ahead.  Let her rip.  Hey, I just want to know  how big would it have been  if North Korea could have  timed that missile  to shoot down the shuttle?  If, if that could have happened,  we would all run in fear  of, uh, Korea.  Of North Korea.  Could you imagine  the technology it would take?  They couldn't even, like, 
[00:55:30]  get that close.  That would have been  check and mate.  The thing is doing, like,  18,000 miles an hour.  Yeah, it would have been  check and mate for Korea,  North Korea,  because we would have,  we would have, uh,  destroyed them finally.  Oh, please.  So some bitches  couldn't close an umbrella.  An umbrella.  All right, Anthony.  Sucks.  All right, boys.  Punching out.  Bye.  So, uh,  Prageria Kid on Dateline.  We could whip North Korea  with a Trident sub.  I firmly believe that.  We could send a Trident sub 
[00:56:00]  over there.  They'd never see it.  They'd park it right off the coast.  They don't see it.  Comes out of the water.  A few lovely nukes  fired from underwater.  End of story.  Yeah.  Gone.  I encourage nuclear war.  As long as we win.  That's right.  Here we go.  Prageria Kid on Dateline.  So let's not get confused here.  Dateline's doing this  because it's a freak show  and it gets the big ratings.  Yeah.  That's the only reason  they're doing this.  They don't give a crap  about Prageria Kids.  There's only five  in the whole world.  You can't care about  something that there's  only five of? 
[00:56:30]  I think there's more  than that, Ope.  All right, maybe eight.  There'd be a couple more.  Here's the audio.  They don't live that long, right?  Here's the audio  from the Dateline special.  But Seth Cook would say  he's having too much fun  to complain.  He considers himself  the luckiest kid in the world.  Ew.  Ripping off Lou Gehrig.  Does he really think  he's the luckiest kid  in the world  because he can get in  the movies  on a child's  and a senior citizen  discount  all at the same time?  Is he really 
[00:57:00]  the luckiest kid  in the world?  By the way,  the intro to this piece,  the little fella  is riding a toy truck.  Of course he is.  He's riding a toy truck.  You know,  before you consider yourself  the luckiest kid  or guy  or woman in the world,  can you really  take a look at yourself  and then everyone else  and really think,  are you luckier  than that guy there?  Are you the luckiest kid  in the world  when you look at  dad's driver's license  and you say,  what is that?  He goes,  don't worry,  you'll never need to know.  If being able 
[00:57:30]  to see your blood  pump in your veins  through your  transparent skin,  if you always wanted  to look like  the hiney-headed aliens  from Star Trek,  then you truly are  from the Menagerie episode.  For the people  that I don't know,  precarious kids,  they age really,  really fast.  Yeah.  They got bodies  like old men  by the time they're five.  They're totally bald.  They got like weird  little pointy features 
[00:58:00]  and they age.  And they,  like by 10 years old,  I think they're 90.  And that's about it.  All right,  back to the story.  The luckiest kid  in the world  with great parents  and the coolest dog around.  That will outlive you.  No matter what the obstacle,  Seth seems to find a way  to pick himself up  and keep coming back  for more.  This is your new mark.  Above all,  this is a boy  in a hurry.  I can never get moving.  There's no time to waste. 
[00:58:30]  For Seth Cook,  life is too precious.  Oh, I beat it.  I beat it.  That's it.  The record.  A nonstop joyride  that could end  any time.  Nice.  All right.  There they go.  That's terrific.  The happy music  just ended.  Ended at any time.  That could end  at any time.  Their lives go by  so fast  that God even gave  them the fast voice.  Yeah.  You know?  Hey, how you doing? 
[00:59:00]  Yep.  I'm on the helium diet.  What the hell?  And you didn't think  God had a sense of humor.  They just stopped  the happy music.  Everything was fine.  Right.  Plays with his dog.  Luckiest boy in the world.  Nice music.  Right.  That could end  at any time.  They have to  over-dramatize it.  I hate when people  take something in nature  and make it look like  it's because of  one of God's  physical actions.  Like after something 
[00:59:30]  bad happens  it was raining.  That's because  God was crying.  Yes.  Was he?  I don't think so.  All right.  Hold on.  I've got to get  that piece again now.  Did E-Rock  steal my breakfast?  Oh, okay.  No.  Where's Ant Comlet?  All right.  Here's the ending again.  Made it a while ago.  Omelets are being made  by the Brooklyn Diner.  I think they're going to...  Thank you.  There you go.  You're being served.  Brooklyn Diner,  57th and 7th Avenue.  Breakfast courtesy  of XM Satellite Radio  blowing all the other  breakfasts out of the water. 
[01:00:00]  Can I say the fruit  I just had  could be the best thing  I've ever eaten  and I want more.  All right.  Well, strawberries.  Here's the end  of that piece again  with the music  dramatically in.  Yes.  You're passing.  What the freak  is going on?  Hold on a minute.  As everyone eats.  I want to eat.  Somebody get the  boss of food.  I got my food over there  but I can't sit here  and just chew.  Yes, you can.  I can never get moving.  There's no time to waste. 
[01:00:30]  For Seth Cook,  life is too precious.  Oh, I beat it.  I beat it.  That's it.  New record.  A non-stop joyride  that could end  any time.  All dramatic.  There you go.  Oh, I did it.  I did it.  Did you?  Did he say,  I beat it?  I thought it was  I did it.  Oh.  I beat it.  All right.  The next clip is  racing a fast-forwarded clock. 
[01:01:00]  Who wants to guess  what the Progeria kid hates?  Sunlight?  God.  The answer is  very obvious.  What do you think  the Progeria kid hates?  Wait, wait.  Oh, the guy.  Geez.  Obvious, huh? 
[01:01:30]  Huh?  People  that make fun of him?  When he gets stuck  to flypaper  and he has to yell,  hey, don't curl me up  and throw me out.  When people treat him  special or different.  I bet he hates  when people treat him  different.  Right.  Like when they  single him out  and go,  that's the boy  we want to throw rocks at.  Let's go to 
[01:02:00]  Jeremy in Jersey here.  Jeremy, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jared.  Hey, man.  That would have been funny  if they put that  screeching record  sound effect  after that intro.  Bye, midge me.  Bye, fella.  All right.  This is what  the Progeria kid hates.  All right.  11-year-old Seth Cook  is a little boy  with a big pencil  and an even bigger problem.  Matt.  I know what he hates.  When his Social Security 
[01:02:30]  checks bounce.  I know what he hates.  The little fella  hates math.  Can you blame him?  Of course he does.  Can you blame him?  What good is it  for him, really?  No matter how you look at it,  it's bad.  Multiplication,  forget about it.  Addition, ugly,  subtraction,  well,  kind of factual.  Why would he want  to count past 10?  Yeah.  Doesn't really need to know  anything past 10,  maybe 11. 
[01:03:00]  When you take  what could have been  and you subtract what is,  you're left with sadness.  The only equation  that really matters.  All this poor,  poor little kid,  old man,  guy.  Uh,  dead bent.  He's seen his golden years  at age two.  I remember.  Let me tell you,  you kids don't understand  what it was like.  Oh.  11-year-old Seth Cook  is a little boy  with a big pencil  and an even bigger problem, 
[01:03:30]  math.  Like any school kid,  Seth would rather be  anywhere else.  But math class  is where we found him first.  When he's, uh,  when he's talking  about the old days  and when,  when,  when,  when,  uh,  when Seth describes  the big one,  he's talking about a duty.  Uh,  well,  people are calling up  with other things  he may hate.  Let's go to Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  Yeah,  I think the little raisin  hates when you press  fast forward on the VCR. 
[01:04:00]  Nothing.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah,  let's go to Anthony in Virginia.  Anthony.  Yeah,  I thought you were going to say  he's taking naps  because that would be  the equivalent  of a three-year coma.  He hates naps.  They are like comas.  Very good,  Anthony.  All right.  Well,  that's funny.  Found him first.  How you doing?  Good,  how about you?  Good,  my name's Rob. 
[01:04:30]  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  I think we have something  in common.  No,  we don't.  What?  I don't like math.  Oh,  I thought you were going  to be dead  in six months too.  I am also laughed at  by everyone.  Do you really not like math,  Rob?  You douche.  Yeah.  Hey,  and they all got to get down low  and yeah.  Way to relate to the little fella.  Would you talk to a normal 
[01:05:00]  11-year-old kid like that?  No.  He would talk like a normal person  kind of conversation,  would go on,  but he's got to get,  hey,  you know,  I'm like you.  Really?  I hate math too.  Ah,  yeah,  Kevin from Connecticut.  Did he buy that toy truck  when he went through  his midlife crisis?  The audience is ruthless.  Let's go to Jeff in Ohio.  Jeff,  what's up?  He hates the fact  that at age 10 
[01:05:30]  he has to take Viagra.  Wow.  All right.  So he can stand up straight.  All right,  they both hate math.  Let's continue with the clip.  I don't like math.  So this would be 14.  With a disease  that perversely turns  years and numbers  upside down,  maybe it's no coincidence  that Seth and math  have always been at odds.  I saw your report card.  You're passing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you don't know  the date on that report card, 
[01:06:00]  though.  Oh,  things have changed  since the last report card?  A little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit?  How about a lot?  I've gained 20 years.  Right.  In one semester.  Thanks, God.  How could you give the kid  an F if you were a teacher?  I know, right?  I'd give them all As.  Why would you even go to school?  Seriously.  Yeah, why would you?  Make them get left back?  Yeah.  You've got to pass them  no matter what.  Yeah.  What do you have to  give them a real gym test? 
[01:06:30]  Give them an F?  Really?  Yeah.  Come on,  the chin up.  The alarm cracks off.  Let's go to Elliot.  Elliot!  Hey,  I heard he didn't do  his math homework.  He got grounded  30 years to life.  When he gets grounded,  it's like 40 years to life,  yes.  Well,  more people  trying to figure out  what he hates.  Yes,  Max in Dallas.  Yeah,  I think he hates  Alvin and the Chipmunks  because it sounds like  they're making fun  out of him.  Punching out. 
[01:07:00]  Bye, Max.  I just want  to live  a year.  And,  yes,  he stinks at math  because of his  Alzheimer's.  Those numbers.  I just did  that problem.  No,  you didn't.  What do you want  for Christmas?  A big wheel  slash little rascal.  I can't do the voice.  So I just got to  talk like that.  Now you just got to  kind of make it  sound a little higher. 
[01:07:30]  He's actually really  He's much too high.  Yeah,  he's way up there.  Wait,  is that good?  I can't sound like  him.  That's not bad.  I can't do impersonations.  We need helium.  All right,  why don't we take a break?  We'll continue with  the Pajuria Kid  from Dateline  in a few minutes here.  Why don't you eat Opie?  I'm going to eat  my omelette there.  My omelette.  Thanks.  I have an announcement  to make.  No.  All right.  Is it important?  It certainly is.  Excited.  I don't get this one.  Let me see if this works.  Brandon in Brooklyn.  Brandon.  Hey,  what's going on? 
[01:08:00]  Hey.  How are you guys  doing today?  Oh,  good,  Brandon.  Thank you.  I'm glad to hear it.  Yo,  this kid hates  four in the afternoon  because Matlock  and Pokemon  are on at the same  time.  All right.  All right.  The young,  the old,  that's kind of funny.  Matlock.  Good reference.  Very good,  Brandon.  You pulled it off.  Poor little  mayfly kid.  Yeah.  Let's say,  uh,  all right,  we'll take a break.  It's the only virus  spreading across America.  I was going to go  to a call,  but we really are late.  We'll continue  in just a bit. 
[01:08:30]  Welcome to the O.B.  and Anthony.  Mister,  are you okay?  That really  looked like it hurt.  Mister,  mister,  mister.  Okay,  goodbye.  The O.B.  and Anthony  show.  Yeah.  I just ate the best  omelet ever. 
[01:09:00]  Courtesy of the  Brooklyn Diner.  Here in Manhattan,  57th and 7th Avenue.  Wasn't that good?  XM Satellite,  Satellite Radio  providing breakfast  today.  Oh my,  yeah,  that was good.  Cooking omelets  in the studio.  Thank you guys.  Unbelievable.  And the fruits.  I've been shoving  fruit in my fat face.  Fresh orange juice,  coffee,  oatmeal,  bacon,  sausage.  It just goes on  and on. 
[01:09:30]  Thank you once again  to the Brooklyn Diner.  Amazing.  And incidentally,  before we move on,  I have to,  I just,  Lucky Louie's,  they're doing a block  tonight on HBO,  all four episodes  of 8.30.  8.30 to 10.30 tonight,  the first four episodes  if you missed any.  And even if you didn't  miss them,  and you want to watch  them again with a loved  one.  Very,  very good.  All right,  back to the Progeria  Kid on Dateline.  Lots of instant feedback  coming in,  by the way. 
[01:10:00]  Mapmaker,  from a website  we can't promote.  When are we going to  figure this out?  We've been asking  the company to figure  this out for us.  It's very,  very important  to us that we  mention our websites  and our message boards  and all that,  because we're a very  interactive radio show.  And a lot of people  I haven't even gotten  an answer.  No?  No answer from the  bigwigs around here.  Steve doesn't even  want us to be on the  radio,  so we're not going to  get an answer from  him.  No,  no,  his name is  Steve.  Steve from  Washington. 
[01:10:30]  Thanks for the support,  Steve.  Our Steve is Steve.  The one in Washington  is Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Yes,  there's Steve.  Steve.  Who's our Steve.  Right.  Who's the homoerotic  embarrassment.  And then there's...  Ow.  I really thought  he was going to  throw his bottled  water at me.  One of these days  he will.  Oh,  he will.  He'll snap.  No,  there's just a lawyer  down in Washington.  With his fist  wrapped around it.  He'll throw it.  Poof.  That begs CBS  not to rehire us, 
[01:11:00]  so thank you,  Steve.  Thanks for the support.  Begged.  Begged.  We greatly appreciate it.  Please hire the police  hire the police  hire the police  Matt Maker  from a website  we can't promote  and we really  need an answer.  We need to start  promoting our websites  and our message boards.  Very important part  of this program.  What's it begin with?  Can you say that?  The W one.  Okay.  The fine fan site.  Oh,  I thought you meant  W,  W,  W,  W.  No.  You don't really know.  That wacky website.  When you give out  a website address,  do you really need 
[01:11:30]  to start with  W,  W,  W,  W.  Old people  that don't know  what their website  or the internet  is about.  Remember when Buddy Ebson,  ah,  banana,  a long lost Buddy Ebson,  he's now dead.  But we used to talk  to him all the time.  We were hoping to be  the last interview  that Buddy ever did,  so that's why  we kept calling him.  We came close.  We came close,  but we got fired,  and that kind of  screwed the whole thing up  because he died  when we were fired.  But he was one  of those older guys  that had a website  but had no clue 
[01:12:00]  what it was all about.  It's,  the address is  h-t-w-dot-buddy-com-d-  And you just know  when old people  have not a clue,  like obviously  somebody's running it  and doing this for them.  Yeah.  Do you have a website,  Buddy?  Yeah,  I got a website.  Well,  doggies.  It's  thebuddyw.com-l-d-w-slash-t-t-dot-buddy. 
[01:12:30]  What?  What?  Hey,  let me try this.  There's a website out there.  Yeah.  It's  whackbag.net.  Ain't gonna work.  It's like the gambling sites.  Oh,  and then the real one.  See,  because that website  doesn't exist.  Right.  And then you make the mistake  of putting  dot com  and there you go.  Uh-huh.  Maybe we can work it out  that way,  Steve. 
[01:13:00]  Steve.  Have you gone there  to see what that is?  I know you didn't want us here,  but can you at least  help us out  and figure out  some of these problems  we're having?  Steve.  What do you say,  Steve?  I want to go there  because I guarantee you  that the one you just said  is ten times worse.  Probably.  That's probably why  they dumped out.  I guarantee they dumped out.  But,  you know,  Steve,  you didn't want us here,  but we have some questions  because we are here  and we want to be  very,  very successful,  so we kind of need  your help a little bit.  We need to promote  our website, 
[01:13:30]  Steve in Washington.  God.  Oh.  He begged.  It's in an article.  He begged and begged  Joel Hollander  not to hire us.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Matt Maker  from a website  we can't pronounce.  I hope this school,  I hope his school  has a good 401k plan  for his retirement.  Talking about  the Pajaria kid.  and Mike  could be  the best one of the day.  Did he go for his first  and last haircut  at the same time?  Oh. 
[01:14:00]  What a little fella.  Want to get back  to the audio here?  As long as we don't  make fun of it.  All right.  It's the Pajaria kid  on Dateline  and for the people  out there  that can't believe  we're making fun of this,  go screw.  Take a long walk  off a short pier.  Pardon my French.  This is how you should  do this story.  Not like Dateline  and make believe  you care about  the little fella.  You don't care.  You're doing it  for ratings  because it's a freak show.  It's a freak show  and it's on our TVs.  You care.  Saturated fat  by Seth Cook.  On this school day,  Seth is offering 
[01:14:30]  his sixth grade classmates  a living lesson  in nutrition.  Saturated fat  plays a big role  in my life.  My body is getting  older faster  than most people.  But amazingly,  what others see  as a burden,  Seth sees  as a blessing.  I'm one of 40 kids  in the whole wide world  that has Pajaria.  So it's really neat.  Oops.  Is it?  Oh, God.  The poor kid  thinks it's neat.  Is it really  a blessing in disguise?  And during that sound clip  it went from 40 to 28. 
[01:15:00]  See, because their lives  are a blessing in disguise.  An old man's disguise.  He's even using  old person expressions.  Hey, good luck, Seth.  Ah, from your lips  to God's ears.  Come on.  Penny saved.  They should at least  bring back some of those names  where you retired.  Like Gertrude.  Oh, my God.  You know.  Yeah, what are some  of the guys' names  from way back when?  I don't think there's a 
[01:15:30]  I don't think there's a  Caitlyn that has Pajaria.  No Ambers.  Right.  Oh, no.  It's a Pajaria kid.  Gertie.  Call him Mort.  Call him Gertrude.  Mort.  Morty.  Let's go to Dennis  in Jersey.  Dennis.  Yo, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I think he doesn't  like playing Half-Life  either.  The game Half-Life.  That's terrible.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Let's go to Jason  in Indiana.  Jason. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Jason.  Hey, Jason.  Welcome aboard.  I bet you the Pajaria kid  hates knowing he's going  to go straight from  Pampers to Depends.  It's not a blessing  in disguise.  Not at all.  He sees it as special  because there's only  so many kids.  How many?  40?  Yeah.  Yeah.  40.  What are the odds, man?  Wow.  Let's say hi to Doug  in Minnesota.  Doug.  Hey.  Hey.  I think at the same time  he's going into puberty  they're going to be 
[01:16:30]  calling him a dirty old man.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we go  to the next clip here.  Pajaria kid on Dateline.  He gets both freckles  and liver spots.  Let's handle this  with dignity.  Yes, let's try.  Please.  He talks about  the people that stare.  Seth says he often  attracts gawking  from adults.  This lady was staring  at me  and she didn't even  see the sign  in front of me.  She just ran  right into it.  She kept walking  and went boom  like right out 
[01:17:00]  of a cartoon.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  How about  Kazoo  in the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  Stupid.  That was the Flintstones.  Whatever it was.  He's the great kazoo.  Exactly.  The Flintstones stink.  Well, dum-dum.  Who's the one  that was on the plane  with Bugs Bunny?  The alien.  The gremlin.  The gremlin, yeah.  Whatever it is.  Whatever has a big head  and was drawn.  That's what this kid is.  Did the lady really  walk into the sign?  I don't know why  she stares.  Because you're one  of 40 on the planet.  She should stare. 
[01:17:30]  People look at a Maserati  when it goes by.  That's true.  There's only so many.  You're never  used to seeing them.  Plus, she wasn't  looking at you.  She was reading the sign  through your  transparent skull.  That was unnecessary.  Why did I say that?  But it's true.  Of course we're  going to stare.  We're supposed to stare.  Those people out there  that think they're  better than everyone  else because they  don't stare.  Shut up.  People don't get it  or don't want to get it. 
[01:18:00]  We're very curious beings  and we like,  like, we got to look.  That's why we  rubberneck at accidents  and things like that  and that's why  when this kid walks by,  people are going to  stare.  And scream.  You can walk in  signs.  You see pregnant mothers  just instinctively  covering their bellies.  Oh, please, Scott.  Is that catching?  Oh, please, Scott.  He's 90.  Please, Scott.  Please, Scott.  I wore my lead  maternity top today.  Please, Scott.  Please, Scott. 
[01:18:30]  Please, Scott.  Out of a cartoon.  Pretty much.  What did you do?  I laughed.  I tried to wait  until she got down  the other aisle  of the store, though.  You didn't want to  laugh in front of her?  Uh-uh.  And why is that?  Because I didn't want  to hurt her feelings.  Aw.  But she was kind of  staring and being  impolite toward you,  so why would you care?  Just two wrongs  don't make a right.  Aw.  Aw.  Steve, this kid  has the wisdom  of a knight.  Oh.  Oh, man.  No wonder. 
[01:19:00]  I think he's been coached.  Two wrongs  don't make a right.  How about a fist  to the chin?  I'd be a grumpy  old preschooler.  I'd be just yelling  and screaming  at everybody.  He knows two wrongs  don't make a right.  A wrong chromosome  and a wrong chromosome  make a wrong child.  Let's go to Jeff  in Idaho.  Speaking of staring,  yes, Jeff?  I was just going to say  next time Seth sees  the person staring at him,  he should just say,  hey, take a picture  or it'll last longer  than I will.  Oh, God. 
[01:19:30]  All right,  I'm punching out.  Let's go to Matt.  You know around his house  all they have is Polaroids  because there's no time  to go to Photomat.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Matt  in Port Clinton.  Matt.  Oh, look.  Hey, Anthony's lying  about Kid Mayfly  didn't get a big enough laugh.  That's okay.  Not many people know  that the mayfly  only lives for a day.  Does it really?  Yeah.  Punch it out.  Yes, it is sad.  I had a pet mayfly once.  They have a nice 
[01:20:00]  they've had a pet mayfly.  It's an awful pet to have  especially if you get attached.  Here we go.  More of the Progeria Kid  from Dateline.  All our time together  was spent me looking at it  in the corner on the ceiling  trying to coax it down  and then it died.  I ate it.  Here we go.  But I had sex with it.  Still, Seth doesn't seem  to dwell on what he can't have.  He focuses on what he can do. 
[01:20:30]  And he's about as well-adjusted  a pre-teen as you could find.  Who's best friends  with his ubiquitous dog,  a rat terrier named Bullet.  Oh, I jumped right into that.  And crazy for Xbox games.  How many hours have you  logged with Xbox?  I don't know.  I'm happy though  because Xbox...  Do you have to put it like that?  I know, really.  Can't you just put  how much fun is the Xbox?  Why don't you just do  a little percentage question?  Stupid ass.  As soon as you heard  how many hours. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, no.  Likes the Xbox  because it beats the next box.  Henchman from Brooklyn writes,  Hey, we have to stare.  It's not often you get to see  the real-life Gollum.  This is terrible.  Why do we do this?  Because Dayline is trying 
[01:21:30]  to make it sound like,  you know,  this is a good thing  they're doing.  Well, this Dayline guy  is a disingenuous douche.  He really is trying too hard.  What did you do?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I walked by a mirror  and wessed openly.  What do you think I did?  Stupid.  Why did you wait  until she was down the aisle?  Do you want to hurt her feelings?  I didn't want to...  But isn't she...  Shut up.  Exactly.  Shut your mouth.  It is all very self-serving.  Of course it is.  At least here, you know.  You know what you're getting.  It's actually garbage.  I don't know. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, the Xbox clip.  We're halfway through it.  Xbox games.  How many hours  have you logged  with Xbox?  I don't know.  I'm happy, though,  because Xbox  doesn't tell you  how long you've been playing.  You don't want to know?  I don't want to know.  Even with stubbed fingers,  a common characteristic  of progeria,  Seth has become  adept at the controls,  an activity  at which he can compete  on an equal footing.  Ew.  Stubbed fingers. 
[01:22:30]  Owned.  Come on.  I'll play him.  I'll own him.  Noob.  He's the oldest noob.  Let's say hi  to Rachel in Massachusetts.  Rachel.  Hi.  Hi, Rachel.  I just wanted to know  if he dressed up  for Halloween  as a little kid.  Oh, my God.  But he is  a little kid inside.  Let's go to  Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, this kid  was doing pretty good  until he fell off 
[01:23:00]  the jungle gym  and broke his hip.  Let's go to  Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  What's up, guys?  Hey, you know what?  Once you have  a child with disability,  I wish all you guys  freaking cancer,  all three of you,  is drunk dead.  Oh, Mike.  Shut up.  Cancer,  you should only get cancer.  He tricked us, too.  He said that  one of his arms  is 10 inches longer  than the other  and staring  as part of human nature.  Well, what if  somebody's arm  is longer?  You're offending them  with your little joking.  I'm sure you didn't mind 
[01:23:30]  us making jokes  about anything else,  but because it's that.  Well, when it hits  too close to home,  that's when you have  a problem with a radio  show like this.  Shut up.  Let's say hi to him.  If you're one of the 40,  you've got to be pissed, man.  Yeah, of course.  Believe me.  Let's go to Randy  on Long Island.  Randy.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  I was just wondering  if he loved the dog  so much because  their lives are measured  on the same scale.  That was just cruel.  That was just mad.  Let's go to John in Queens.  John.  Yo, what's going on?  I'm Bob Packack.  Hey, John. 
[01:24:00]  I'm wondering  when this guy  reaches the age  of the prom.  Is he going to  let Elmer Fudd  in the end?  Punch it out, boys.  He looks like  Elmer Fudd at prom  would have maybe  been the joke there.  Let's go to John  in Arkansas.  John.  Oh, yeah.  The little kid hates  when he goes  into the grocery store  and sees the expiration dates  and just wishes  he could last that long.  He's standing there  and the clerk  actually looks at him  and stamps  some date on him.  What are you doing?  All right. 
[01:24:30]  Let's go back  to more audio.  What a buzzkill  that guy was.  No kidding, man.  What a douche.  Turn something else on.  You know what kind  of show this is.  Yeah, relax.  Yeah.  We finally found  something we could  all goof on.  Sorry.  We don't pretend  to be what we're not.  That Dateline thing  you'd probably watch  and get a little tear  when all they're doing  is mocking this kid.  They're not laughing at him.  They're exploiting him.  Stupid.  These shows are exploitation.  Of course they are.  Michael from Chicago.  He's not a preteen.  He's a neverteen.  Oh, my God. 
[01:25:00]  And if they really did care,  they should be doing  a story on him  every week.  Every week.  Exactly.  They got what they wanted  out of the little fella  and they're moving on  to the next disaster.  Moving on to the next  Predator show.  Right.  Here we go.  Pajaria Kid on Dateline.  On this day,  only the aptly named Bullet  can keep up with Seth,  chasing a tennis ball  and then going bananas  over the bubbles.  Now keep a close eye  on Bullet as he crash lands. 
[01:25:30]  And watch and listen  to the biggest belly laugh  from the littlest boy.  Did you hear that thug?  I think Bullet needs  a stunt dog.  Ew.  Do you really think  Bullet needs a stunt dog?  It's adorable.  I don't mind the kid.  I hate the reporter.  Yeah.  I don't like Bullet either.  That Bullet sucks.  What a bad dog.  Awful dog.  You know what Bullet needs?  A Michelin right through him. 
[01:26:00]  That'll straighten Bullet out.  Or maybe that dog  can go out a soap star's mouth  and we can cover  that other story too.  I've heard about you.  The things you've done.  Made me real sick.  A lot of it.  Get out of here  before I throw you out.  How do you think  this piece ends?  You know how  these pieces end. 
[01:26:30]  It's all fun and games, right?  Yeah.  You got a little tragedy?  A little reality?  Honestly, I don't know.  I don't know if there's  an actual tragedy at the end,  but you know they've got  to get very serious at the end.  I'm thinking he addresses  how tragic it is  and addresses the fact  that the kid will pass on  a little earlier  than they thought,  yet they will focus more  on the fact that  he is living every moment,  Opie, living every moment.  All right. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  Jimmy, you want to guess  how this story ends?  I think that the reporter  will,  the kid will be saying  something like,  I'm really looking forward  and the reporter will go,  why?  Why?  The reporter's, I think,  going to hit this kid  with some cold, hard, ugly facts.  Or maybe a game of hide-and-seek  where a little progeria kid  closes his eyes  and can see everywhere  everyone's hiding  through his lids.  Oh, my God.  Smitty in Boston.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Great.  I'd love to buy this kid  the PlayStation 3, 
[01:27:30]  but I don't think  it comes out until December.  Oh, my God.  I wonder if we hide-and-seek.  The reporter's too cruel  he'll probably hide  in a place the kid  will never find him  like a high school.  Caesar in New York.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, how bad do you think  this kid was hoping  to be a premature baby  so he could enjoy life  a little longer?  Oh, my God.  Really ugly.  See, it really is now  just stepping up  to ugliness.  We pick tough targets, 
[01:28:00]  don't we?  Well, this is how it ends.  Here it is.  Tough, tough.  Yeah, boy,  aren't we real men?  Yeah, we don't touch  the gangbangers.  We touch the Pajiria kids.  Exactly.  The gangbangers,  we give a brief mention.  We get the Pajiria kid  three breaks.  We'll kick his ass  if he comes in here.  Yeah, we'll talk about  the gangbangers  and hope they weren't listening.  All right, here we go.  Real men.  This is how it ends.  The Pajiria kid on Dateline.  If people watching this  worry about you,  what do you want them to know? 
[01:28:30]  Um, I'm going to cry.  And to hear Seth,  the boy in a hurry,  tell it,  he'll be fine forever.  I can't wait to get to heaven.  You can't wait.  Mm-mm.  Heaven is a subject  most sixth graders  never think about,  but Seth brought it up himself.  Patty says Seth  doesn't fear death  and he's anxious  to see his late grandfather  in heaven.  I remember about  seven or eight,  we told him that 
[01:29:00]  he probably would go  see Jesus before we did.  And he thought  that was thoroughly okay.  What do you think  heaven's like?  I'm going to go  fishing with the Lord,  fishing for Swedish fish,  and hunting gummy bears  and chocolate rabbits.  Heaven stinks.  And you don't have to throw  them back.  And you don't have to  throw them back.  Sounds like a nice place.  It's going to be.  Unless you're a fish.  Yeah, right?  Poor fish. 
[01:29:30]  Where does he get to go?  Fish lives a good life  and he winds up  with his creator  sticking a hook in his mouth  showing it to some  freakish boy.  No throwbacks.  If you're going to go  find the Lord,  oh, I'd be finding  the Lord too, man.  Where's the complaint  box around here?  Yeah, no kidding.  This heaven thing  just quite doesn't wash.  That kid's heaven  sounds great for him.  I'd be walking around  going,  another night  of gummy bears?  Can I have an omelet 
[01:30:00]  like we got  from the Brooklyn  Diner, please?  God always had  a miserable end  to the story.  Horrid.  Depressing.  Haven?  I can't wait.  Good.  That was awful.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Oh, by the way,  his grandfather is 18.  I can't wait.  Thank you, Kevin  from Kinetic.  It's Kelly  from the Bad News Bears. 
[01:30:30]  Thanks, Kev.  Let's go to Rick  in California.  Rick.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Rick.  That was a great line, man.  I wonder if he slows  his voice down  just to sound like  what he would sound like  if he was a regular kid.  Hey, can we do that?  Yeah, get his voice,  slow it down,  and see what he would  sound like.  Like, pitch it down,  you know.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  And see what he would  sound like  like a regular kid.  Yeah, definitely.  God damn, finally,  I get a line in  that I can punch out with. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Thank you, Rick.  Bye-bye.  It was a true gem.  Let's go to Elliot  in Ohio.  Elliot.  Hey, how does this work?  If he was born  on February 29th  of the leap year,  does that mean  he'd be like 80  on his first birthday?  Watch it now.  That would just be cruel.  This poor bastard.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Maybe we'll continue  with this.  Maybe we won't.  We shouldn't.  I think that tank 
[01:31:30]  is about dry.  All right.  We got Adam Ferrara  stopping by to say hi today.  Adam's stopping by.  Very, very nice.  We'll talk to Adam next.  I don't like Adam.  And we'll do some  other thing.  My pal.  Let's go to Cody  in Indiana  because everyone's  heaven looks a little  different, right?  Yeah, I guess so.  Cody in Indiana.  Yes, Cody.  Yeah, I think that  heaven for him  is where everybody  gets to look like  the Six Flags guy.  But you know,  it was a great show.  All right, bro. 
[01:32:00]  Very nice.  It's the ONA virus  spreading across America.  Stay tuned for more  Radio Awesome.  It's the Ophie and Anthony  show.  Yeah.  All right.  Looking forward to it.  Hear what everybody  else is talking about.  ONA, uncut, and live  continuing the show  on XM Satellite Radio  starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com  to subscribe.  It's the Ophie and Anthony  show.  Let's go right to the phones 
[01:32:30]  and say hi to Paul  on Long Island.  Paul, what's going on  today?  Hey, what's going on,  guys?  I just wanted to point out  that Ophie just said,  we won't touch gang  backers, but we'll touch  the Pejoria kids.  I'm not a lie.  I think it was meant  figuratively.  Eric, on instant feedback,  Voss, Rich Voss has  Pejoria.  He looks 40 and is as  dumb as a four-year-old.  He has stubby fingers.  I owe the Grim Reaper  80 years, and I'm 
[01:33:00]  dodging him.  Let's say hi to Jenna  in Boston.  Jenna.  Hey.  What's up, Jenna?  Guys, I just wanted to  tell you, keep pushing  the envelope.  You guys make my day.  I work service.  Keep arming you to the  sarcasm I need to get  through the week, man.  Do you?  Thanks, Jenna.  Have a good one.  We're blowing up in  Boston, and we couldn't  be happier.  And we have the  Pejoria kid, I guess he  was hungry, asking for  lunch.  Let me have a Diablo  sandwich, Dr. Pepper. 
[01:33:30]  Make it fast, I'm in a  goddamn hurry.  I bet he is.  Can we speed that up so  it sounds like the  Pejoria kid?  I know.  We're actually going to  have to work after the  show today.  Make it fast, I'm in a  goddamn hurry.  Woo-hoo, Sheriff!  Trailing toilet paper from  his glasses.  Let's say hi to Adam  Let's say hi to Adam  Ferrara, everybody.  Adam.  Enjoying the program.  Adam, always at the  forefront of technology.  Adam comes over.  I know.  This kid, this guy, I  tell you, Adam's always  ahead of it the whole  game.  He comes over and goes,  wait till you see the  new memo thing on my 
[01:34:00]  phone.  So I give him the name  of a book.  It's called Beyond  Einstein.  It's a physics book I'm  reading.  And Adam, with this new  funky feature, enters it  onto his phone and then  walks away.  And I'm like, that was the  big feature you were  bragging about?  Were you expecting he  presses something, it  goes to maybe Amazon,  orders it, sends it to  his house to go, you  know, something other  than just, what you did  was a pencil and paper.  It was writing down the  name of something. 
[01:34:30]  I, look, usually this  phone comes with a bag  and a crank and Raider  O'Reilly has to spin it  to get me, get me  cold.  Adam has this new  feature where you write  something and then when  you want to write  something out, you pick  the little thing up and  you go, and you shake  it.  And it erases it.  What did you expect to  happen?  The author's going to  walk in and explain the  book to you?  Why wouldn't he?  He lives in my building.  Oh, yes.  And wants to know part  of you.  He's a physicist and  named, I'm going to  plug him, Dr. Kaku.  And he's a genius.  And I want to be this  guy.  Another dump. 
[01:35:00]  I want to be this guy's  friend.  If he was that smart,  he would change his  name.  Yeah.  I just want to be his  friend.  Why would he walk around  with a Dr. Kaku?  But I just want to be his  friend.  You want to be his  friend.  Sounds like a Batman  villain.  Oh, my God.  We've got to get Dr.  Kaku back in jail.  Holy parakeets, Batman.  It's Dr. Kaku too.  Not Kaku too.  What?  How many times have you  tried to befriend this  gentleman?  And how do you try?  Well, I don't try to be  his friend.  I used to listen to him 
[01:35:30]  on Art Bell.  He's a brilliant  theoretical figure.  How do we know he's  brilliant?  It's all theory.  Look, he's smarter than  us.  Yeah, and I've listened to  him explain things that  are active.  What?  Like, could you hit  five, please?  What do you explain?  I've listened to him  explain things.  Yeah, I'm getting off  here.  Isn't this your floor?  Not to me, but on the  radio.  And I see him, and he  just wants nothing.  I told you one time he  almost went to the wrong 
[01:36:00]  elevator.  I just want to be  friends with him.  But how do you try to  befriend them?  I just, I always say,  hold on.  Those electrons are  negative.  I asked him a gravity  question one time, of  course, Anthony, but he  just, he explained it to  me out of courtesy.  Like, I mean, not that  he's supposed to hug me,  but it's like, I'm like,  hello, doctor.  And he's always like,  hello.  And he just won't look  at me like I bother him.  There's something about  my face that bothers  this great genius.  And believe me, that  frigging gravity question  to him must have been  like walking up to a  college professor and  going, one plus one, 
[01:36:30]  could you please help  me out?  Believe me, it's like  everyone walking up to  me going, where did I  get your right bears from?  If he could have  spit in my face and  gotten away with it,  he would have.  He should have.  But I see him and I  just, I just want to be,  I want to sit with him  and talk.  I want to, I want him  to call me and go,  hey, it's, it's  Michio, that's his  name.  Hey, let's go for  some coffee.  I go, all right,  whatever, I'm not  doing anything.  And I'll ask him  physics questions and  we'll laugh.  But you get Bob  Kelly.  That's, why, how  does that happen?  I don't know what the  transition is between 
[01:37:00]  making a friend with  like a famous person.  Yeah, know what  you're doing.  You got to talk about  anything but physics.  Yeah.  But what can I,  because it's like  when people come up  to us and want to  talk about the show,  it's like, well, I  know I'm never going  to be friends with  this person because  that's the last thing  I want to talk about  when I'm not doing  it.  But I'm porn.  I've only tried  one.  Send him porn.  Talk about,  it's a good idea.  Hey, Kako, here's  some porn.  Talk about, uh.  Look this, Adam.  Do you like tranny?  Talk about, yeah,  exactly.  Talk about music, 
[01:37:30]  prostitution, anything  else but.  Dude, we have five  seconds in the  elevator.  How do you bring up  hookers?  Hey, uh, what kind  of, you like Ozzy  Osbourne?  No, you don't.  All right, take care.  It's my floor.  Speaking of black  holes.  Well, okay.  That's a good segue.  Well, there you go.  He was cleaning  her chin off.  I guess that was  gravity in action.  That's the mistake  you're making, though.  He doesn't want to  answer those dumb  questions.  I only asked him  that one time.  I said hi to him.  You saw you walk  by that time in the  park. 
[01:38:00]  He was being filmed  doing something.  He was in a horse  and buggy or something  or one of those  bicycle guy things.  Really?  Yeah, they were  shooting him.  I'm like, that's like  what?  Probably doing a whole  thing on drag, gravity,  thrust, you know,  everything on one of  those stupid little  wagons.  I'm sure he wasn't  just taking a stupid  ride.  Maybe he's Amish.  I mean, no,  they're uninsured.  I just want him to see  me and go, hey, Jim,  and we'll talk a little  bit.  Jim, yeah, something.  Hi.  Any type of recognition.  The next time you see  him, just talk about  anything but and see if  it goes anywhere.  We don't even have  time to talk. 
[01:38:30]  It's always high and by.  Like, I'll see him  walk by.  I'll just go, hello,  Dr. Kaku.  And he'll nod.  He's polite, but I can  just see it in his eyes.  Does he know your name?  Like, Mr. Norton or  Jimmy?  Why would he?  He's thinking of  numbers.  No, he doesn't know my  name.  Here's what you do.  And it hurts.  Here's what you do.  For the next few days,  make up a tag with your  name on it like it's  official, like you're  working, like something  like CBS or something.  Jim Norton.  Put it on there.  That way, when he sees  it, now he sees your  name.  And then when you say,  good morning, Mr.  Kaku, he will say, oh, 
[01:39:00]  hello, Jim or Mr.  Norton or something.  And then after a while,  you lose the tag.  He knows your name.  Now he knows your name.  And wear a lab coat.  Yeah.  Oh, a lab coat.  Yes.  Good one.  There you go.  Maybe I should mumble  to myself and let him  show him the memo  feature on your phone.  You want to borrow my  phone?  I know what I'll do.  I'll fake a phone  conversation.  I'm so good at this.  Like, he'll be around.  I'll walk by and I'll go,  ah, just doing calculations.  Get me Los Alamos, please.  Lots of instant feedback  coming in.  Mr.  Torrance writes, yeah,  Jimmy was doing a whole  thing on drag in the park 
[01:39:30]  too.  Pat from Menaki, you know,  he gets, he gets a little  with his feedback.  He writes, Jimmy can  explain silly string  theory.  And then, and then Bill  from Waterford.  I think Jimmy's treating  Dr.  Kaku like a hot chick.  He'll never score with.  I don't appreciate my  attempts at friendship  with this brilliant man  being mocked.  I will someday be a good  friend of his and we'll  sit down and chitchat.  Jimmy, Christmas time,  you send a hooker to that 
[01:40:00]  guy's house, he'll say  hello every time.  No, he's married and he  like, likes his wife.  He dedicates his books to  his wife.  He's like a happy guy.  See, so there's no way  you can bring up any kind  of, like, smart or porn.  You know what?  Nothing.  A guy that brilliant,  though, you gotta think  something that's going on  on the other side, like  he's, I don't know,  he's into feet.  Has some kind of goofy  thing.  Some weird dumb thing.  Into feet.  Yeah.  Where only his wife knows  is like, God, if the world  only knew.  But you can't bring that  up.  No.  You gotta talk about, like,  but you can't do the weather  or something stupid. 
[01:40:30]  Do you know anything more  intimate about the guy?  Is there something on the  internet besides just his  books?  Well, now that I see him,  I'll tell him I'm reading  your book, because the book  is actually really good.  I'm gonna say, that's it.  Now you read his book and  go, now I was reading on  this part here, and then  you talk about it a little.  That's how fast our  interactions are.  Ding, ding.  It's gotta be quick.  All right, I'm reading  your book.  You like badminton?  You know, just try and  find...  Hit the emergency stop  and just look at him.  How are you guys gonna  ever be friends?  I don't know.  He's pretty much figuring  out how the whole universe  works, and you tell jokes 
[01:41:00]  in a cellar.  You guys need something  in common here.  Go on, hurt me.  I'm an easy target.  Anthony's right.  I mean, come on.  You gotta stop the  elevator.  You gotta be like Archie  and the black guy in the  elevator.  Yeah.  Just hit the emergency  stop.  Hit the emergency stop.  We're talking.  Or maybe I should  get in front of him.  I'll stop the elevator.  Super string is for fags.  You're never gonna be  friends with a guy.  I know.  Stop trying.  But I wanna be his friend.  I want him to look at me  and be happy to see me.  Yeah.  Hey, Jim. 
[01:41:30]  Perhaps a back slap.  Why not?  I can't shake.  Well, good luck,  because I hope you do  get a friendship with him.  He was my favorite guest  on the Art Bell show.  And Art Bell had wackos on  and like three legitimate guys,  and he was one of them.  That's wonderful.  Art Bell is wonderful.  We could do...  I like Art Bell,  and I'm gonna talk about him.  UFO nut.  We could do a new batch  of news teasers.  As long as they're scary.  We got a few clips  from Yvonne.  She's scared of balloons. 
[01:42:00]  Why, Vaughn?  Scared of balloons?  Scared of balloons.  Why don't you try this?  That's the same broad?  No, no.  It was on the same show  with the girl  that was scared of pickles.  Oh, she was scared of pickles.  Yeah, and she started crying.  This is Yvonne,  scared of balloons.  A little different.  And what show is this?  Maury, of course.  Maury.  And Maury chased the girl  around with pickles.  Yeah, that was one of the best  clips we've ever played.  Maury's lost it.  Maury, I think,  is a little angry  about the cancellation  of his show with Connie.  What's it called?  Awful. 
[01:42:30]  It's called Bad Career.  Maury.  Maury's a fan  of this program.  Maury.  Maury, if we were  in an elevator,  we'd go,  Hey, Anthony.  Hi, how are you doing?  He might,  but if you didn't know him  and you said hi,  he'd just look at it  and go,  Is there something  physically wrong with you?  Do you have a child  with a problem  I can exploit?  Hey, Maury,  we exploited  the interior kids  just like you.  Hi, you're so little.  You're special.  Let me tell you something.  You are a special  little child.  Kids crying. 
[01:43:00]  Let's bring out  Jawless Penny.  Bring her out, everybody.  It's Jawless Penny  or Joe is bitten off  by a bear.  And then they bring her out  and she's crying.  Kids, make fun of me.  And Maury's got to  get down real low.  You are beautiful to me.  Why is my tongue  so long?  You are beautiful.  Maury, why can't  you make eye contact?  Why do you look away  when you say I'm beautiful?  Because you really  disgust me.  Hey, for Adam, 
[01:43:30]  we've got to play  the pickle audio.  Yeah, let me get  a little taste.  We know we've done  this already,  but we've got to play  for Adam.  This is one of the latest  things in talk show things  where you take people  with phobias  and to fix them  of the problem  because exploitation  is a no-no.  To fix them  of the problem,  Dr. Maury,  or Dr. Tyra  or any of these  other doctors  that all know  what to do,  confront them  with huge amounts  of what they're scared of  and throw them at them  and get them 
[01:44:00]  in warehouse fulls  of them  until they're insane,  until they've completely  lost their mind.  A psychiatrist  can't take care  of the problem,  but Maury can.  No, Maury will fix it.  In one hour show.  Get me out.  Here we go.  18-year-old girl  named Mariah  hates pickles  and everything about them.  The whole world  eats pickles,  but it's ruining her life.  She's teased in school,  and she, of course,  in school,  was called the pickle girl.  You know,  once you know, 
[01:44:30]  this is what the sight  of a pickle does  to Mariah.  My name is Mariah  and I hate pickles.  I hate everything about them.  Pickles are destroying  my life.  People make fun of me.  I feel ashamed  that I'm actually  afraid of them.  I think about pickles.  I just want to throw up  and throw away.  What I hate most  about pickles  is the shape,  the texture of it.  Yeah,  it's not about pickles.  This has nothing 
[01:45:00]  to do with pickles.  It has nothing to do  with pickles.  At all.  I bet you some uncle  has a green tinge  to his joint.  Yeah,  a little bit.  That's what kind of did it.  Little bumps.  Yeah.  Some instant feedback  when we first talked  about the story.  I don't know  if you read it,  but it was the funniest thing  you said this is all  due to her uncle,  Lou Ferrigno.  I can't take credit  for that great line.  It's a good one.  Well,  Maury sends Mariah  to the pickle factory.  We wanted to see firsthand  the extent of Mariah's 
[01:45:30]  pickle phobia.  So we sent her  to the Patterson pickle factory  where she would come  face to face  with thousands  upon thousands  of pickles.  So they put her on the pinball machine 
[01:46:00]  with the pickles.  It's like from Tommy  when all the beans come out.  It's like a pan.  It goes to my stomach.  The pickles.  Now,  does she have a problem  if you slice them?  We don't know.  We don't know.  Yeah.  And we don't care.  The sliced ones,  the quartered,  classic.  Right.  I don't know  if that scares them.  Or if it's the complete  whole pickle.  Because she said  she didn't like the shape.  And the texture.  Texture. 
[01:46:30]  And the way it spits at her.  Right.  Sometimes.  Oh,  you bite it the wrong way.  Of course it's.  Yeah,  the juice is.  It squirts in the eye a little bit.  The pickle juice gets you.  Yeah,  you know.  Pickle sneeze on me.  Yeah.  When did this all start?  When I was really little.  Yeah.  You couldn't stand them?  Well,  a lot of kids  don't like pickles.  And they just don't like pickles.  But they,  they don't look,  I mean,  just because I,  they don't do this.  Huh? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  You've got to get over this,  right?  Huh?  Do you have nightmares  about pickles?  Oh,  I used to.  Stop it.  Stop shaking.  Thank you.  The pickle had  razor stubble  and whiskey breath.  The pickle was going to  kill my puppy  if I told him.  Come on.  What?  I thought we were  talking about pickles here.  He made that stork  watch me.  That's not just a 
[01:47:30]  gank,  you little girl.  And finally,  because we,  we really,  we played this audio already,  but we can't get enough of it.  Maury,  of course,  has to bring out  hundreds and hundreds  of pickles  because this is what  will cure you  of your phobia.  Horrify her.  Shakia and Louise  have confronted  their phobia.  Didn't like it.  You're going to have  to confront yours.  You've got to see a pickle.  No.  Can we have a pickle,  please?  No.  Or two?  No.  Or ten?  No.  Stay there. 
[01:48:00]  Stay there.  Stay there.  Mariah.  Mariah.  Where's Mariah?  I don't have anything.  I don't have anything.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You just, 
[01:48:30]  you have to confront them.  You know,  Gary's going to have to,  you know,  he has to understand  where you're coming from.  All right?  Okay,  let's go back on.  Let's go back on.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Stay there.  Stay there.  Eat it.  He's yelling at her.  That is a fave.  There is a gherkin joke there.  A gherkin joke there somewhere.  Gherkin.  Wow.  She does not like pickles.  So there you have it.  I know that.  Big deli ones really like  the torpedo-looking pickles. 
[01:49:00]  Like the cucumbers?  Yeah.  The brand of the Carnegie Deli  and just kick her.  Yeah.  Press her up against the glass.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jim in New York.  Jim, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I have no-talent comic-phobia  like with Jim Norton  and you two ugly douchebags.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thanks, Jim.  Anything else, Jim?  And then he hangs up.  Now he hangs up.  What a faggot.  All right.  You know what you should have?  Jim, after...  You should have my father 
[01:49:30]  raised a faggot-phobia  because that's what you are.  We wouldn't have hung up on you, stupid.  How long did he wait on hold this day?  Did he take the whole week off, by the way?  I don't know.  Jim, you know,  I've been doing radio  since I was 18 years old.  You're going to have to come up  with something a little better than that.  Oof.  You have to have thick skin  if you do this job.  And that doesn't even take thick skin.  Do you know how many times  you've heard that?  I could have survived that one.  I don't like when someone calls up  with their little thing and hangs up.  I said it!  Yeah, they got no balls  to stay on the line  and just continue the conversation. 
[01:50:00]  Go ahead.  We love it.  Yeah.  Love when someone stays on the line  and tries.  To the last caller.  Go ahead.  I hope you're killed  on the way to your own wedding  because you're a douche.  That's a good one.  What do you think of them apples, mister?  All right.  Let's take a break.  When we get back,  Yvonne, scared of balloons.  Balloons!  We'll continue with the phobia thing.  There's also a lady scared of dogs  and another lady, Shakia,  who's scared of birds.  Dogs is understandable, though.  Yeah, dogs is boring. 
[01:50:30]  Birds, eh.  Balloons.  Well, since the Hitchcock movie.  That's good.  Every time the girl goes  to use pink lipstick,  she cries.  Okay.  No, that just means he likes you.  Oh, by the way,  Howard's off for two weeks.  That's why more of the callers.  They're heroes off.  There's nothing to listen to.  Where's the revolution, guys?  The revolution seems to be calling this program.  What's the matter?  Nothing left to listen to on Sirius?  So you got to come over here?  Leave. 
[01:51:00]  Don't listen.  You don't like us?  Don't listen.  Your hero's got a revolution going on at Sirius.  Leave it.  Give him a plug.  There's a word.  You heard for months about the revolution.  Go ahead.  Now deal with it.  He's got a new symbol and everything.  The fist.  You paid for it.  Now deal with it.  It's a perfect symbol for him  because that's what he's given his listeners.  That's what he's given his listeners.  Go ahead.  There's the revolution.  And you all bought into it.  Another day off.  You all bought into it.  His revolving calendar of days off.  That's the revolution, you ass.  So that when he's off, 
[01:51:30]  we'll get a few phone calls.  But don't hang up.  We understand you're bored.  There's nothing to listen to,  whether he's on or off.  Give us a call.  But don't hang up.  Faggot.  Fight the revolution.  What are you?  The Iraqi guard?  The Republican guard?  Yeah.  Take me.  Believe me, it's easier.  You bunch of jackasses.  We'll play some audio from Yvonne  and then we'll end today's show.  How's that?  Adam Farrar in studio.  What are we promoting today, Adam?  What do I got there?  You are my pals. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, I'm at the Mohegan Sun.  Oh, 14th and 15th, July.  I also heard that tonight you're watching  Lucky Louie from 830 to 1030 at HBO.  I will be doing that.  That's what I am.  A marathon.  I enjoy that show.  Not a marathon.  There's only four episodes.  That's a marathon.  A marathon.  A quick walk in a circle.  You know what episode I missed?  The one where you pull out the gun?  Did that one air last?  Was that last week's episode?  That was the third episode.  That was the third episode.  Yes.  I have to catch up.  I'll cut it out, you.  I do.  Want to see my new memo thing?  I do the midget thing in this one, too.  I'm putting it in my memo. 
[01:52:30]  Jim, Lucky Louie, with a pickle.  That memo thing.  I wanted to throw Adam's phone.  I was so annoyed.  I was waiting for a new feature.  It's going to Google search automatically.  But he does that, and he hits enter, and he walks away.  And I was going to bite him, but he didn't.  A notepad.  All right.  We'll continue just a bit.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Radio for the apathetic.  Or is it pathetic?  The sweeper is pathetic.  Obi and Anthony.  And you just punch these numbers in, Jim, and thanks. 
[01:53:00]  Let's say.  Yeah, but how do you hear the person, and how do they hear you?  I don't understand.  You just put it right up to your ear, and then when they say hello, you just talk into this  little thing.  Bad, dude, technology.  I don't want to deal with that.  All right.  Let's say hi to Danny in Canada.  Danny.  The wireless.  Hey.  What's up, Danny?  Not too much, man.  I just called and said you guys are awesome, and props for Lucky Louie over to Jim.  Thank you.  I watched that show up here in Canada.  It's freaking awesome.  Then we lop our ass off back home.  Well, what is it? 
[01:53:30]  Do we stink, or are we awesome?  I don't know.  Thank you.  Because that other caller said we stink.  I think it's wicked.  Like, we listen to you guys up here all the time.  I drive a truck for a living, and that's all I listen to every morning.  Get up every day, drive my truck down the road, listen to you guys every morning.  My co-driver's got that serious radio with Howard Stern on it.  Yeah.  I always try and disconnect it all the time.  Let's be honest.  It's very easy to be awesome in Canada.  I mean, we don't have to try that hard to entertain you now, do we?  We appreciate our Canadian friends. 
[01:54:00]  Our neighbors to the north.  Our north of the border friends.  As they call them.  Thank you, mister.  Thank you for standing on guard for the people in the air.  Props for that show.  Lucky Louie's great, man.  And props for your show on the radio.  Thanks, buddy.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  Stop standing on guard for the we don't need you.  On the radio.  We could do it ourselves.  Yeah, the radio show's pretty good.  The radio.  All right, why don't we do the scared of balloons thing?  Yeah, we got Adam Ferrara in studio today.  We heard the pickles.  Pickles, yes.  Adam, what's that plug again?  Is this Q's on? 
[01:54:30]  Uh, Mohegan Sun, uh, the 14th and 15th of July.  Sweet.  All right.  Yvonne, Maury, uh, Maury Povich, uh, the phobia show.  Scared of balloons.  We got to get right into this because we're, we're running out of show on this side of the  Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, she's trembling right now because Yvonne is deathly afraid of balloons.  What?  What?  What?  Balloon.  Lunatic what?  Are you just afraid they'll pop?  Everything.  The look of them.  Huh?  The way they float.  Everything.  The way they float? 
[01:55:00]  Everything.  Everything.  The way they float.  You're worried about a balloon floating?  Yes.  Evil.  What could it do?  Um, I don't know.  I just don't like it.  You think the balloon is going to ultimately be the cause of your death?  I'm going to die one day because of that.  You're going to die because of the balloon?  Yeah.  There's just going to be so many of them and.  Killed by Peter Potombs.  When was the last time you were at a birthday party with a balloon?  Well, it's been a while.  And I wonder if it's a fear of heights.  A weird fear of being floated away by a balloon. 
[01:55:30]  Floated away by a balloon?  Yes.  That is kind of scary.  Yeah.  I don't think it is though.  I used to have nightmares that I'd be in a hot air balloon.  And the thing would get cut like at the end of Willy Wonka.  Except I wouldn't be with a wizard man.  I would just be alone and floating up towards the atmosphere.  And I couldn't get down.  You need some help?  Would you like some help, Don?  Help yourself to a balloon.  You ever read It?  When the clown is murdering the gay lover.  He's taunting the other lover by offering him a balloon.  And he likes the clown. 
[01:56:00]  The guy's yelling, help, help.  And the clown goes, you need help, Don?  Help yourself to a balloon.  And has like a whole bunch of balloons on the bridge.  That is just an evil, evil character, man.  Help yourself to a balloon.  To a balloon.  Slaughtering his friend.  Well, she's going to explain what happens when she sees balloons.  Thank goodness.  Good old Yvonne.  I'm so afraid of balloons.  I can't see them.  I can't get close to them.  I can't even think about being in a room filled with balloons. 
[01:56:30]  Kill yourself.  When I see a balloon.  So what do you think we do?  Yeah, really?  You can't even think about a room full of balloons, huh?  Now it's a puppy.  Just don't scare you.  I can see it on the street.  And I'll just run out into the street without even looking.  I just keep running.  I need to be cured.  Because I can't do anything with my grandchildren, I need to be able to just be around.  How old is she?  I thought she was like 12. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Grandchildren.  She has grandchildren and she's afraid of balloons.  Mm-hmm.  What an ass.  You think she makes fun of the pickle lady?  Get over it!  Ah!  At least I got a legitimate fear.  Balloons.  What an idiot.  I wonder if there are all kinds of balloons.  You know?  They're a reminder of like hot air balloons.  But now, you know the grandkids are going to torture her now.  Happy birthday to me.  Take a picture, Grandma.  I would torture the hell out of her.  I'd bring in big things of balloons every time you go over. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, why not?  Make her watch the end of The Wizard of Oz.  I can't do anything with my grandchildren.  I need to be able to just be around people and children that have balloons.  I need to go with them and be around them.  And I can't.  Schmaltz music.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm so afraid of the balloons.  We heard you.  I'm so afraid of the balloons.  She sounds like an educated, brilliant woman.  In theory.  You take away balloons.  She'll be your friend, Jimmy. 
[01:58:00]  And put in another word, and I'm that person.  I'm getting trashed on the instant feedback.  What are you getting trashed on?  Oh, by the way, before that, henchmen from Brooklyn,  I'm guessing most of Maury's guests are also afraid of jobs.  But DJ, a name I can't fully read over here from Dallas,  Opie, for the love of Christ, it's E-Yan.  The Y is pronouncing E.  You back from vacation?  Are you back from vacation yet?  What did you say? 
[01:58:30]  I'm saying Yvonne because it's spelled Y-V-O-N-N-E.  Oh, it's Yvonne.  I didn't catch it.  Unless it's spelled wrong in front of me here.  And E-Yan.  I don't have any E-Yans in my life, so I don't need to know how it's pronounced.  It's a long time.  For E-Yans, I've been saying it.  E-Yan.  All right.  Yvonne.  Ms. Yvonne.  Is Maury saying E-Yan in the clip?  I don't even know.  Anyone else pick up on that?  I could give a crap what this girl's name is.  Exactly.  Stop picking on me.  Her name is Dummy. 
[01:59:00]  Luggage Jumper.  Here's Yvonne, scared of balloons.  Fearful dolt.  Watch this, Yvonne, please.  He's saying, is he saying Yvonne?  Yvonne, yeah.  Balloon bitch would be too cool.  Yvonne.  He's saying Yvonne, I'm saying Yvonne.  Is that what's going on here?  It could be Yvonne.  Whatever.  I've heard Yvonne, where it sounds like Yvonne, but you say Yvonne.  Yeah.  Tell that guy to shut up.  Watch this, Yvonne, please.  Dating.  What are you, a sick ass. 
[01:59:30]  That sounds like gunfire.  It's the Robert Kennedy assassination.  Here comes Sirhan Sirhan with a balloon.  Wow, that's great stuff.  He's popping balloons and she's losing her mind.  Watch this, you ass.  Want some help, Yvonne?  Help yourself to a balloon.  To a balloon.  Watch this, you crazy idiot. 
[02:00:00]  Watch this, Yvonne, please.  All right, Yvonne, that's enough.  It's not funny.  It's not funny.  It's just a nice day. 
[02:00:30]  It's over, it's over.  Come here, come here.  Wow, come here, come here.  Well, come here, you're more, you passive-aggressive sadist.  Stop it!  Tell me all the places you...

That's enough.  Yvonne, that's it.  We're going to take away the balloons. 
[02:01:00]  There's not going to be any more balloons.  Come here.  Come here.  They're not going to be any more.  They're gone.  They're gone.  Come here.  They're all gone.  They're all gone.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Control yourself.  Get yourself together.  It's okay.  Calm down.  It's over.  Okay?  I don't want to see any more balloons.  Oh, my God.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, that's better.

Oh, is that hysterical?  God, does that really change the mood of it? 
[02:04:30]  That's funny.  We're getting a request for the Bob Kelly leg-breaking song.  The one with the Bill's Dead call mixed in.  Can't do it over here?  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  No man makes that sound.  Ah.  I went to Bob's house the other night, and me, him, and his chick watched-  Actually, it was just me and him, his chick went to bed, watched Transamerica with Felicity  Huffman playing a tranny.  You guys, man.  Mediocre movie.  How did that stupid Reese Witherspoon win the Oscar over this? 
[02:05:00]  I'll never know.  Yeah.  Oh, that Reese Witherspoon was mediocre.  I didn't see it.  I won't be seeing it.  It was pretty good.  Yeah, let's say hi to Matt in Jersey.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Love the show.  Hey.  Thanks.  I, listen, she's the biggest idiot ever.  I don't know if it's the funniest thing ever or the most infuriating thing ever, because  I just want to punch her in the face.  Yeah.  I mean, I can't believe that.  It's ridiculous.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Well.  Hey, we could end the phobia bit with scared of birds. 
[02:05:30]  Let's see what this one's about.  Birds.  Okay.  Scared of dogs.  I mean, that's pretty- Unless Maury brings in a whole pack of wild dogs.  What are they, birds?  Wolves.  Well, there's two more here.  I don't know if scared of dogs is worth playing, because that's what- Some people are scared  of dogs.  A lot of people are scared of dogs.  Birds, though.  Like, what?  Just them tweeting in a tree, or if a falcon is coming at you face first, but it's talons  out, that could be a little- With the vultures eating your liver. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, that could be a little- You could be taken aback.  Let's find out here.  Let's find out why she's scared of birds.  Shakia.  Am I saying that right?  It's Lisa, you idiot.  Shakia has a phobia that a lot of people might have.  You do not like our fine-feathered creatures.  Come on.  Stop it. 
[02:06:30]  It's just tweeting birds, like the nicest sunrise scenario.  No kidding, man.  And she loses her mind.  Pigeons, seagulls, parrots, peacocks, even chickens.  Oh, of course.  Shakia almost got hit by a car running from an innocent little bird.  This is her story.  My name is Shakia, and my phobia is-  I thought it was a couple of Italian birds.  Everything about them, everything about them, they're, oh, they're beaks. 
[02:07:00]  They walk nasty.  They're ugly.  They're beaks.  Everything about them disgusts me so much.  They have germs.  Addiction.  They pick over garbage.  I just, I can't.  Oh, gosh.  I don't know why God created birds.  I don't know why it's racing right now.  I can't do this.  I want to be cured from this because I want to be able to live life to the fullest.  It's, I'm so scared of them, and it's just ability. 
[02:07:30]  It really is.  Those evil doves.  Pat from Minaki wants to ask Maury if he could help him.  He's scared of naked hot chicks.  You're scared of hot, naked chicks, Pat.  We filled this room with him.  Go.  This is horrible, Maury.  Hey, Bobby from New York City.  You guys are missing the girl who is afraid of mustard. 
[02:08:00]  This is a week old.  It's all over YouTube.  Can we find that?  All right.  So we're running out of show here, but let's do it really fast.  Thank you.  Thank you, Brooklyn Diner.  There goes the Brooklyn Diner taking away our special day breakfast courtesy of XM  Satellite Radio, the best breakfast we've had thus far, blowing everyone else out of  the water, although we appreciate everyone else's breakfast efforts, including Cleveland  and the bagels that we threw in the garbage.  All right.  Say hi to Jerry.  Yes, Jerry Seinfeld will be at the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th, around 10 o'clock this 
[02:08:30]  morning.  When you see him go, but I don't want to be a pirate.  Hey, we're running out of show, but Maury brings out the birds.  We got to see what this is all about.  Why won't you eat a tuna fish sandwich?  I was on my way to work.  And I grabbed me a tuna fish sandwich to take the work with me.  And the seagulls, they chased me for my tuna fish.  Oh, I said it.  It wasn't the tuna.  I'm feeling so fresh.  There is only one way.  Gary Cox will tell you. 
[02:09:00]  You see Gary right here?  Yeah.  He will tell you there is only one way to handle this.  You must confront your fear.  Pet the falcon.  Bring out the little bird.  Isn't that funny?  His name is Gary Cox.  Because like a cock is a chicken.  It's a type of bird.  A rooster.  Oh, right.  They bring out the physicist, Dr. Cockatoo.  He's going to scare the hell out of him.  It's Caku.  Don't make fun of my friend.  It's Caku.  Dr. Caku.  I'm sorry.  He's never going to get to talk to him.  Does he live in a clock and come out every hour?  That's a cuckoo. 
[02:09:30]  No.  You ass.  All right.  Listen, we're running out.  The smartest clock I've ever seen.  Dr. Caku likes Cocoa Puffs.  We've got like a minute left and 30 seconds left in this clip.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Bring out the little bird.  The little bird.  Okay.  Just bring out the little bird.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Wait a minute. 
[02:10:00]  Wait a minute.  Don't.  Don't.  Move him away.  Move him away.  Don't move him away.  Out.  Out.  Out.  Get out.  Get away.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  There are no birds out there, are there?  Okay.  Come on out.  There's no birds.  No birds.  Oh, God.  What they don't tell you is this is actually a show for the bird because the bird has a phobia.  It's afraid of.  And that's how we end today.  I don't know why God made him.  We'll be continuing on XM Satellite Radio with Adam Farrar. 
[02:10:30]  Adam, do your plug real fast.  I'll be at the Bohemian Sun.  July 14th to 15th.  All right.  We're running out of show here.  Guys, thanks a lot.  We'll see you tomorrow if you're not joining us over at XM.  What?  I don't care how many.  Dick.  Robe. 
[02:11:00]  Soup.  Tears.  Poodle.  Robert Reed.  And repeat.  And repeat.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Here's the deal on the corn tickets.  Tomorrow, outside XM Satellite Radio up the street, we'll give out how many pairs of corn tickets we got left?  2,000.  20 to 25 pairs of tickets. 
[02:11:30]  We'll do that tomorrow morning right outside XM.  If you're in the area, stop by if you want corn tickets, okay?  It's time to do the walkover to XM Satellite Radio.  Let's get everybody moving.  Why would Adam have a mic at this point?  Don't we have a mic for Adam?  Why?  Can't we have a guest mic at some point?  I thought they came in last week.  He's a guest, for the love of God.  What did you say, Jimmy?  High camcorder guy.  I don't know.  I can see.  They came in last week.  What happened?  The mic's actually here, but the unit on the other side that picks up the mic isn't here yet. 
[02:12:00]  Why would they have sent it?  Oh, is that it?  Why would they send both pieces of equipment when you need both of them for it to work?  Why?  That soon we're going to be pushing a shopping cart with a repeater instead of an antenna for  these microphones.  Hey, Skipper.  I like that better, actually.  We can go more places.  All right.  Why are they getting upset at the antenna out the window gag?  Yeah.  The building doesn't like that.  Oh, fuck the building.  People need to take a shopping cart with a repeater.  Fuck the building and fuck the guy that runs the building and fuck Steinway Pianos. 
[02:12:30]  They stink.  Both buildings hate us.  Oh, fuck both buildings.  They're douchey office thieves that they have.  I like how Jimmy says, fuck Steinway Pianos.  I hate that fucking piano store.  I hope a fire rips through it.  Like Steinway Pianos.  Nice hairdo.  Fucking Steinways are awful.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hi.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Wake up. 
[02:13:00]  It's a beautiful morning here in New York City.  Oh, look at this one.  Wow.  This certainly isn't a good day for people.  It's not a lot of people.  They're all miserable.  That guy looks like he climbed off the Empire Stateville.  Yeah, there's a few.  Hi.  How are you?  Why is Keith the cop dressed like he works in an ice cream truck?  I'll have a push-up.  Boy, we feel real safe today with Keith dressed like that. 
[02:13:30]  Absolutely.  If Brutus or olive oil comes over.  He doesn't even know what we're talking about.  He has no idea.  He's trying to act all cool and tough.  Can I have the...  In his white outfit.  A vanilla cone.  Did you just get off a boat?  He doesn't even know what we're talking about.  Shouldn't you be living in Trees Lounge with that awful white outfit?  Do you still have a plunger push-up?  All right.  Ooh.  You want to cross this way? 
[02:14:00]  Wow.  Let's cross this way.  Oh, by the newsstand?  Let's get this walk over with.  We'll get away from...  We want to have to pass Mac.  Holy shit, we still do, yeah.  Yeah.  He's old news.  That's right.  Wish he'd lose a limb already.  Exactly.  Oh, look at this lady with the thing on her head.  Oh.  What's with the helm?  Oh, wow.  Oh, what's wrong?  What's wrong?  What's the matter?  What happened?  You all right?  What are you...  You're riding your bike to...  Who are you?  I'm Jim Norton. 
[02:14:30]  What are you doing here, honey?  We're actually doing an AIDS walk.  Oh, an AIDS walk?  Oh, well, congratulations.  I wish I could join you.  What does your shirt mean?  We're actually giving it to people who don't have it.  Giving it.  Bush.  This is an election shirt.  Should left?  It's got to do...  No child left behinders.  No child...  Yeah.  It's a Bush joke.  Why?  Oh, no child left behinders.  Vote for a new lineup in 2004. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  Well, let me tell you something.  I've never left a child behind.  Never.  Absolutely not.  How can you?  So young, so low Asian.  You're exactly right.  Well, I wish you good luck, and I hope that whatever your money...  Is that what you're walking for?  Yes, yes.  Well, you'll make a lot of money.  Money and AIDS awareness.  There's a lot of money here.  We want to make it aware that Jimmy has it, and...  You should be walking up the buildings up here where the money is.  Oh, is that where the money is?  It never comes down this way?  All the high muckety-mucks. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  The highfalutin.  Where are you riding your bike to?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm going shopping.  What are you going shopping for?  Wow.  Oh, you know, milk and champagne.  The things, the normal things you have in the morning.  Milk and champagne.  Wow.  That's good.  You have your safety helmet on.  Yeah, you ever need that helmet?  You know, hit a bug or something?  Your bike is as old as you, by the way.  Recording all of your faces at the same time.  Oh, the helmet's wired.  You're a nice lady.  Yes.  All right, let's get out of here.  Thank you, miss.  There she goes. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you, you old bad.  That old crow attack.  Wow.  Old battle axe.  Exactly.  Look how she's got...  You know what that bike...  You know what that bike needs?  A dump truck on the side of it.  Doing 60.  That fucking Pee Wee Herman's old bicycle she's wearing.  She's wearing a bike.  She might as well be wearing it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hello, Mac.  There he is.  Hey, Mac.  Sorry, no money today.  That's right.  Get a job.  That's right. 
[02:16:30]  You're lazy.  What have I done?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That old lady had an awful ass, too.  Oh, didn't she?  Yeah.  Yuck.  I wanted to squeeze it really head and watch her...  I wanted to squeeze it really head.  Really head.  Oh, fucking suck.  I thought her, uh...  The underarm fat that was hanging...  You know that loose skin old people have?  Yeah.  I thought it was going to get caught in a bicycle chain.  I wanted to grab it and just bite it.  Is that illegal?  Yes.  But not...  Uh, not, not fun.  How come none of us can talk? 
[02:17:00]  Look at this.  Because we're a man.  Oh, God.  Look at the advertisement for My Super Ex-Girlfriend.  That looks really good.  Looks like a terrific movie.  Is that Alec Baldwin?  No.  That's one of the Wilson brothers.  Exactly.  That's Luke.  Luke Wilson.  How fucking awful does that look?  Oh, she's holding him upside down.  Because she's super.  That's funny.  She's very strong.  Wow.  Why don't they just call the movie Strong Cunt? 
[02:17:30]  That's the working title.  Sorry.  I'm sick of the fucking Wilsons and their hide-my-baldness hairdo.  That'd be sick.  I write with the fucking Waynes as we get it.  Little man, though.  Do we?  That was terrific, too.  It sure does.  Look, I'm not saying I don't watch my wife and kids and just laugh and laugh.  Funny family.  I don't think a lot of people heard when Jimmy told that old woman that we were on an AIDS  walk, that we were spreading it to people who didn't have it. 
[02:18:00]  Jimmy goes, we're giving AIDS to people that don't have it.  I don't think she caught that.  No.  She didn't catch that little tidbit.  Let's get upstairs.  All righty.  Bye, everybody.  Oh, that was on Pal Talk, by the way.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Holy shit.  All right.  Oh, good.  Right before the fire truck.  Thanks, Sam.  Here's the piano place that you like.  Oh, I was hoping.  Is this the guy who I hate?  I was hoping he died. 
[02:18:30]  He's still alive.  It.  All right.  We'll see you in a couple.  I'm going to see you in a couple.  Don't bring it, Anthony!  A couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Eh.  Complete whores.  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  It's a creation against the church.  It's disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again. 
[02:19:00]  How can we blow up our lives today?  You rocking sex.  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Uh-oh.  We're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing.  And then when they go too far, they suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today. 
[02:19:30]  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot. 
[02:20:00]  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now at the new climate of radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  My name is Opie and Anthony.  My name is Opie and Anthony.  I'm going to listen to Opie and Anthony.  Opie is great, great, beautiful.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  Can you be an interview?  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. 
[02:20:30]  XM people.  Hi, XM people.  No pesky FM radio people in to ruin our fun. 
[02:21:00]  Teasing, of course.  Have to say that.  Hi.  Good morning.  ONA Mach 2.  Second half of the program done here live, uncensored.  No more trying to beat around the bush.  We say cunt.  Beat around it.  Beat right around it, in it, through it.  Whatever the hell it takes.  Take that.  We're here to do it. 
[02:21:30]  Very nice.  Jimmy did the old chewing his gum really loud gag on the elevator, which upset a girl so that the second room opened up.  She moved to as far away as you could possibly get from someone on an elevator.  Can you hear it, actually?  Yeah.  It was horrid.  It's just this...  And she was kind of laughing, yet she wanted to get as far away from you as possible. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Hey, we should do the dog phobia, because now we got it right away.  We got to see what that's all about.  You got that, E-Rock?  We weren't going to do it, but...  And we can make jokes about having sex with that dog.  That's right.  Take that, pooch.  All right.  The Mori-phobia thing continues.  Mori-phobia.  Ah, they did dump out of the website mention.  Of course they did. 
[02:22:30]  You know where that takes you?  Did you look?  Where?  Whackbag.net?  No.  Takes you to Whackbag.com.  Oh, really?  Same site.  Who knew?  We had two dumps today.  739, Whackbag.net by me.  651, working backwards.  Neighbors who I fucking despise.  Caller discussing his neighbor's house going up in flames due to fireworks.  I despise.  So we don't need to do that.  I hate it.  Despise. 
[02:23:00]  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  Still eating the Brooklyn Diner food.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Lovely.  On to the oatmeal now.  Did you get strawberries?  Yes.  I'll have to thank Elo.  You know, we chatted on my way in today, me and the big boss.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, we did.  Elo called me.  On the way in?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, call.  He's up so early all the time.  I got a call from Bobby Eatman over the weekend.  Wow.  Yesterday. 
[02:23:30]  Too hungover to take it.  Really?  I was too hungover to take an important call from my agent.  What's going on with him?  We got some action.  Last I heard, some action.  Oh, here's some.  Here's a good one right here.  Wait till you hear this.  All right, strap in.  Joe from Texas.  Hey, I think you guys got a phobia of being original and funny.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  That's a good one. 
[02:24:00]  That's a good one, Joe.  That's all you got, Joe?  Joe, come on.  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah.  Joe, is that it?  Why are you listening if we're not funny, though?  Come on, man.  Or original?  Because I don't have serious.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  The revolution's happening over there.  The rates are the same.  Why not?  Wait, you have XM, but you don't have...  Go ahead.  Serious costs a little bit more.  A little bit more.  How much little?  Aren't they pretty much the same now?  They're not enough for any kind of real fan to notice. 
[02:24:30]  Not enough.  So let's say it's even a dollar more a month.  It's for $12 more a year, you're not willing to change over, you're willing to sit and listen  to us unoriginal, unfunny pieces of shit, then your hero, who, by the way, is off.  Again today.  Again for two weeks.  Go ahead, stupid.  Answer.  It ain't worth it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not worth it.  Well, you know, times are times.  No, I don't.  And I'm asking you, $12 a year, times are tight? 
[02:25:00]  That's what, I guess, the increase amounts to.  This guy's not a real...  You want like $150 for one unit.  Well, you had to buy something.  You bought the XM first.  Didn't you buy the...  How did you get the XM?  Not only did you buy the XM, you're listening to us.  You're listening to us?  You're not even listening to your hero?  What's your problem?  I only listen to you guys so I can call a ridicule you.  No, that's not why, dude.  No, Joe, you know that's not true.  Joe, we let you talk.  You have no venom. 
[02:25:30]  You got nothing.  You got no passion, dude.  If there was anything else entertaining to listen to, you'd be listening to it instead  of listening to something that doesn't entertain you.  Don't you get that?  Joe, why don't you just hang up and try again?  Yeah, I think I want to do that.  Yeah.  You might as well, bro.  Joe, it's the red button.  Bye, Joe.  You got nothing.  As you reach to either hang up or change the station or something, please put your head  down for a second and lean that steering wheel over to the left a little bit. 
[02:26:00]  Just lean it over to that huge concrete abutment that is holding up a train trestle.  Close your eyes and count.  See how long you can make it.  What a douchebag.  Adult.  I don't mind a guy hating the show, but fucking hate it with some kind of venom.  Let's say hi to Brian in Pittsburgh.  Brian?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How dare you defend my buddy, Howard Stern?  Fine, I'm serious.  All right, thanks, man. 
[02:26:30]  Well, look at him, guys.  As a listener of both services, I want to say something.  Okay.  He has two channels.  You guys have one.  There's actually more content on both of his channels.  Did you guys know that?  More content of what?  More content.  You got Scott Pharrell on there.  That guy's terrific.  Now, you know something?  What?  There can be more content if it stinks and no one wants to listen to it.  And part of the question, why did you guys go back to regular radio?  Why?  We always wanted to.  We wanted to do both.  No, no, no, you didn't. 
[02:27:00]  Howard was making fun of you guys about that.  So why did we go back, Brian?  Yeah.  You tell us.  Wait, wait.  You tell us why we went back for a very lucrative deal.  I think I know why you guys are trying to cheat the listeners.  How?  It's XM.  How?  By giving them mediocre radio.  I don't like your sing-song delivery.  I treat the listeners.  Mediocre.  Hey, dude, do you realize something?  We're on live today.  I know.  Your hero is off again for another two weeks.  He has bamboozled you.  He has bamboozled a serious satellite radio into paying him so much money to do so much 
[02:27:30]  less than he used to do.  Guys, I want you guys to get my radio show.  Listen, I'm doing radio in college radio today from one to three.  Hey, there we go.  That dump right out of that.  I'm not going to let you plug a radio show.  Go fuck yourself.  Come on.  And your mother.  Stop trying to get listeners and try to get like a little buzz going.  That's what you're doing.  Get listeners on your own merits.  Talk about what you want.  Yeah.  Do it word of mouth like real people did when they first started. 
[02:28:00]  Brian.  You fucking dumb cunt and your dream.  Go fuck yourself.  You want to be a radio guy, do you?  I want to be a radio guy.  I want to be on the radio.  You're a douchebag and you're going to flop miserably because you fucking talk like your  nose is stuffed.  And stop trying to laugh it off while you're thinking what to say.  The uncomfortable laugh.  Shit dick.  Stop, Brian.  Good luck, do you?  Yeah, the I'll think while I'm pretending to laugh nonsense instead of just having dead  silence.  No, you guys are being funny. 
[02:28:30]  You're a fucking, you're going to be, you're a college radio flop.  I'm graduating in May.  Who cares?  Who gives a shit?  You need to call us and try to plug and it didn't go through.  Good luck, Brian, the board op.  Come on.  I'm not just going to be a board op.  No one gives a fuck.  No, you're not going to be.  Sure you're not.  Goodbye, Brian.  Goodbye, stupid.  Good luck in your future ventures in radio.  Fucking 600 watt station.  Brian in North Carolina.  Brian.  Hey, I just wanted to say fuck all these Howard fans. 
[02:29:00]  I hope they all die of ball cancer.  I hope you're the biggest asshole on radio and you're my favorite, man.  But then I feel good about myself and then you smash me.  So how are you going to smash me?  I'm not trying to smash you.  I love you, man.  Wait, there's a real compliment?  I'm getting a real compliment?  You are getting a real compliment.  I'm getting a real compliment?  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Y'all kick ass. 
[02:29:30]  Punching out.  By the way, for all the Howard Stern fans listening to us because they need live programming,  while we're trying to do radio because we still have passion to do this, yeah, we'll  take time off every once in a while like a normal radio guy.  Stern blamed for tension.  Why do they always talk about Howard?  Because when he takes the day off, Howard's not on the radio, so we'll give you an update  on what Howard's been doing instead of doing, you know, revolutionary radio. 
[02:30:00]  The revolution, Robin.  Where's this from?  The Post?  Yeah.  Of course it is.  Yeah, of course it is.  Of course it is.  I am starting a radio revolution.  Really?  Everybody.  Yes, yes.  What I'm doing, it's the first.  Never done before, Robin.  Really?  If the Post could, they would print Stern's dump schedule.  Stern blamed for tension.  Tension.  Excuse my interruption.  Why do I have fucking three copies of Monday's paper in front of me? 
[02:30:30]  Because we're in it.  No, I know that, but where's today's paper?  Why do you need today's paper?  By the way, I'll take you inside the show a little bit.  You know when I was, like, trying to find the Tom Cruise story from today?  Yeah.  And I was, like, in panic mode?  What were you looking at?  I kept looking over and over again in Monday's paper.  Why would we have today's paper?  Yeah, I mean, I understand why we have Monday's.  I think it's good.  But why are they all laid out?  I felt like Dr. Bellows.  I was like, it was...  But I read it this morning, and it's not here anymore. 
[02:31:00]  I just saw it, but I...  I was looking over and over again in Monday's paper for the Tom Cruise article from today's paper.  Of course.  Stern blame for tent-shin.  Howard Stern has found himself caught between two Harris's.  Harris's.  Harris's.  Harris's.  Harris's.  Harris's.  Harris's.  Two Harris's.  Harris's.  And I just got my compliment, too.  I just blew my...  No, you didn't.  Because for a second there, a lot of people might have thought you actually pronounced a silent H.  She's the Harris, thot. 
[02:31:30]  Well, I started panicking because...  It's the Voss and Anthony show.  Howard Stern has found himself caught between two heiresses in the Southampton house he rented  for the summer.  The king of all media's neighbor, Dana Hammond, whose grandmother was a sister of TV Guide founder  Walter Annenberg.  Oh, the Annenbergs.  This is what your hero's up to, by the way.  Oh, I'm keeping it real.  Instead of doing radio.  Okay, applied for a permit to erect a tent on the beach to celebrate the birthdays of 
[02:32:00]  her sons, Oliver, 23, and Mills, 21.  Mills and Oliver.  Announcing Mills and Oliver.  But Stern's landlady, Terry Allen Kramer of the Allen & Company.  Allen & Company.  Guests have arrived.  Investment banking dynasty wrote a letter recommending the permit be denied, saying she didn't want  any damage to her dooms.  What a cunt.  The Sterns have arrived, introducing Lord and Lady Aduushabag.  Love that old bit. 
[02:32:30]  She didn't want anyone damaging her dooms.  There's vinegar and water in the drawing room.  The town fathers approved the tent.  The town fathers.  We'll dress creatures in the woods and tell people that they're out there and they shouldn't  leave the compound.  There'll be no tents on our dooms.  Why do you think they're all wearing red?  They're the elders.  They're the elders.  Why don't they put on written and give me an acting lesson because I don't look like 
[02:33:00]  China Gage.  I have a cleft palate.  The town fathers.  The town fathers.  Which year is this?  It's 2006.  This is who Howard Stern is hanging with.  I have to hang out with the town fathers, Robin.  And you idiots are going to call us and defend Howard?  I just got a pout of my hair.  I don't even need the pouted wig, Robin.  Of course you do.  I just pouted my hair and, ooh, I'm a town father.  Yeah.  Someone give me a birthmark on my powdery face.  Love me, town fathers. 
[02:33:30]  Love me.  Howard, where's your snuff?  The town fathers.  Approved the tent and the party went off without a hitch on Saturday with bonfires, dinner,  and dancing for 300 guests such as David Koch, Somers, and Jonathan Farkas, Debbie Bancroft,  Patty David Raines.  Who are these people?  It's the worst guest list ever.  This is society shit.  Society shit, yes.  This is all this elite society fucking idiots that this cockbag Howard wants to be part of. 
[02:34:00]  Well, congratulations.  Who's more pathetic is Richard Johnson, the fucking cunt, the cunt, who runs this page  six, the fucking, get behind the wheel, allegedly.  I heard you got pulled over for drunk driving.  Is that true?  I don't know, but it's what the papers said.  That's what they reported.  You fucking, you nose up the ass cunt.  Oh.  This is what Howard's become. 
[02:34:30]  I remember listening years ago.  Years ago, Howard goofing on a Chevy Chase.  It was some of the most compelling radio I've ever heard in my life.  It was the mid-80s.  And Howard called, got Chevy's house number and called it.  It was a very compelling radio.  And Howard said, he goes, isn't it fucked up?  It's amazing.  Didn't say fucked up, by the way.  Right.  He said it was amazing how Chevy had turned into the very people he had goofed on on SNL.  He drank the Kool-Aid.  Well, there you go, Howie.  You have now turned it completely into one of those people that you had goofed on for so many years. 
[02:35:00]  You're hanging out with the town fathers.  The town fathers, erecting tents and society people that I've never heard of their names.  Pierre-Francois de Libriuski.  Libriuski, he condemned the sewers.  He did.  There's another one.  Karen and Richard LaFrac.  The LaFracs.  I'm hanging out with the LaFracs.  He now hangs out with what's called bold names.  They call them bold names.  Bold names?  Yeah, they're darker than all other bold-type names. 
[02:35:30]  But when Hammond spoke to the crowd and mentioned that mean people try to stop this party from happening,  many guests thought she was pointing her finger at Stern.  Oh.  Stern tried to shut down a party in the Hamptons.  And, of course, he was playing host to Jimmy Kimmel and Sarah Silverman.  Of course he was.  Out in the Hamptons.  There you go.  So stop defending him.  He doesn't give a shit about you.  Town fathers think he cares when he's out there.  They applied for a permit to consort with a Negro. 
[02:36:00]  Denied.  Denied.  Not this far out east on the island, sir.  We'll let Sammy dance, but he has to come in the back door.  Is he one of the help?  Yes.  Yes, so when you're called to defend him, just have fun.  That's right.  All right.  Knowing that he's out in the Hamptons, not even thinking about the show.  Fucking dirty post.  What?  What's wrong? 
[02:36:30]  Just a fucking post.  Richard Johnson and Linda Stacey.  That cunt.  Well, they teached us a lesson by making sure our article ran in a Monday's paper.  Yeah.  We get it.  You don't like us.  I hate Linda Stacey's picture.  That cunt.  She's a cunt.  With that fucking severed white cadaver hand on her pig face.  Read.  Read what she has to say today about the Dave Chappelle show. 
[02:37:00]  She loves it.  Four stars.  Which, maybe it's great.  I mean, I like Dave.  You know what?  Whatever.  She loves it.  She hates it.  It's just how she writes about it.  It's in the TV section in the back there, Jimmy.  All the way.  Keep going back.  Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back,  see you.  There she is.  There it is.  Read the first paragraph, maybe two paragraphs.  You'll puke.  Listen to this, Anthony.  No matter what you're doing, they'll make sure you're home by nine, that your TV is tuned  to Comedy Central, and that you have strapped yourself safely into your sofa. 
[02:37:30]  If all that is done, then, and only then, can you safely watch the first three Chappelle  show lost episodes, which are so funny that without safety restraints, you might fall  off the couch from laughing so hard, tragically hitting your head, and die an early death.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Fucking you.  Wait, where did you start making it up? 
[02:38:00]  Dude.  The dying thing is in there, too?  Word for word, it's in there.  Stop it.  I thought the last sentence was you.  No.  I would have sworn.  That had you written all over it.  That's right.  This fucking...  She's a mullet cunt.  That's all I...  That's one word for her.  My name is mullet cunt.  And the fucking discolored hand.  Look at the cunt.  Linda Stassi.  S-T-A-S-I.  Look at the fucking...  The cadaver hand this cunt has her fucking fat mullet face propped up with. 
[02:38:30]  I'd like to grab that fucking hairdo and rape her mouth.  What do you think of them apples, cadaver hand cunt?  What do you think of them fucking apples?  What did she do to you, Jimmy?  You fucking New York Post cunt.  What did she do to you, Jimmy?  I gotta see the picture.  She gave Lucky Louie no stars.  And I didn't care that she hated the show.  I just hated that she complained about the set.  I didn't like the set.  She's kind of cute.  She's a fucking...  A mush mouth cunt.  Look at the fucking dead body hand propping up that fucking pig face. 
[02:39:00]  With the pinky just enough where it's like almost touching her chin.  She should have a fucking black dick dangling on her nose while she goes,  Fucking dead body hand cunt.  Did you laugh so hard you fell out of your seat?  Strap yourselves in, kids.  Why don't you die from a drunk driver hitting your mullet?  Oh, fuck your mother.  Dead body cunt hand. 
[02:39:30]  I've never heard of someone dying that way before.  Wow.  Drunk driver hitting your mullet?  I went to Stacy and I have a mullet.  Do you know how it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile?  I was once told by a white-handed cunt.  Wow.  Frank.  Frank the frown.  I heard Frank use such harsh language.  Oh, wow.  Do you know how it takes more muscles to write a bad review than it does to write a good review? 
[02:40:00]  I heard by a woman who I hope was raped by a gang of Dominicans.  I hope they fucking mouth rape her.  Not even her pussy or her ass.  Her mouth.  I hope they open her fucking jaw.  The way you open the jaw of a fucking...  Like the way King Kong opened that fucking T-Rex's mouth.  I hope that's the way they open her mouth and they all fuck it.  I hope you fucking crack your head on the coffee table like William Holden and die, you fucking 
[02:40:30]  white-handed twat.  You fucking Michael Jackson glove-handed cunt.  Oh, I'd like to bite her fucking nose off.  Wow.  Holy shit.  I didn't like this set!  Sorry, you fucking homemaker.  You unfunny writer.  You're a shitty writer.  Oh, wow.  Fucking hate that, bitch. 
[02:41:00]  Let's go to John in Chicago.  John.  How am I supposed to follow that?  I don't know.  I'm sorry, John.  I apologize for my language.  I got a little off color.  Yeah.  So I love the show, but so far, today's show, Jimmy said three times that people that  either don't like your show or Lucky Louie, if they were to phrase it differently, he'd  be okay with it.  I would have actually...  How would you like the criticism phrased?  If she attacked, like, the jokes or just like...  You understand what I mean, but when someone attacks the set or the fact that there's dirty 
[02:41:30]  profanity, that's what bothers me.  When somebody attacks the jokes or they don't like the show or they don't like the acting  or they don't like the storylines, all that I consider very valid.  But when somebody attacks the language, it's like, Jesus, dude, why does comedy have such  a double standard, like, where it has to be fucking...  Why is the language an issue at all?  I don't understand that.  It's on HBO.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So that's what I'm saying, bro.  Victor in Baltimore.  Hey, I just want to ask Jimmy if he's got anything else other than raping and ball cancer 
[02:42:00]  and fucking in the mouth by black guys.  Come on, let's hear some original shit.  Well, that's pretty original, dude.  Who else said that in a row?  Wait, wait.  Dude, you got to give me this.  The key is in a row.  Dude, if you didn't laugh at the King Kong T-Rex line, you're just silly.  Yeah, come on, dude.  How could you not enjoy that?  The founding fathers never said that.  Yeah, let's go to Jeff in Florida.  Jeff.  You got to leave these guys on longer.  Don't let them hang up.  Don't hang up.  Jeff.  Boy, I just wanted to say, man, I love the show.  Love James Norton.  You got a lot of passion, and I'm not going to hang up.  Thanks, Scott.  All right. 
[02:42:30]  Thank you.  Bye, mister.  Bye.  See, it says Opie's my favorite.  I don't believe that.  Oh.  See, I'm getting smart.  I bet you are.  I bet you are.  I'm getting smart.  Watch.  Steve in Texas.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hi.  I just wanted to let you guys know how much I love the show.  Jimmy, you're really, it's the honesty, I think, in your comedy is, you know, talking  about all this stuff in your past.  And Anthony, it's like the voices, it's like the people are really there, right?  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  But I got to say that Opie's my favorite.  He's the best.  When I started listening to the show about five minutes in, Opie threw poker chips at  some woman.  Oh, okay.  I was driven from Vermont to give you guys presents or some shit.  Yeah, that's one of my favorite things ever.  Opie's your favorite stooge.  All right.  I immediately fell in love.  All right.  Thank you.  And incidentally, to correct that last caller, the one who said, do I only have this, what  I said was, I hope she has a black dick on her face, but I was hoping that her mouth  was raped by Dominicans. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  And I didn't say ball cancer today, sir.  No.  So get your insults straight, fella.  If you're going to hurt a boy's feelings, at least hurt them accurately.  I didn't forget about E-Rock's MySpace blog.  Oh, no.  Where is it?  Oh, boy.  I didn't forget.  Like everyone who read it.  I didn't forget when we started with this on Friday and I said, I will save it for when  we come back.  I better have a copy, too.  From our little mini vacation.  We got that on the way.  And we also have Maury's Phobias show.  We got to do Scared of Dogs next as well. 
[02:44:00]  Okay.  Where's Kenny?  Where's our copies of Kenny?  Did I have a copy of E-Rock's?  Did he leave?  Kenny went home, man.  Oh, that's good.  Why?  I'm glad he asked me if I wanted a smoothie today.  Whoa.  Fired.  I'd say fire him.  Kenny, fired.  Kenny, fired.  Oh.  He comes bounding in.  Kenny.  We don't need any more food.  We've been eating all morning.  I need a smoothie.  No problem.  Thank you, Kenny.  I was doing another menial task, but you're much more important.  Of course I am.  Attaboy, Ken. 
[02:44:30]  Anybody else?  No, sir.  Can you get some of caffeine, Kenny?  Yeah, what would you like?  What are you, running numbers on flash paper?  Yeah, look at it.  The guy's got like a stack of these little slips of paper with things written on him.  Give me the Jets and over.  He's running numbers.  What do we got with coffee?  Caffeine.  Wait, is this good, Sam?  You want a smoothie?  Coffee, coffee, coffee.  It's very funny.  We're now taping Jimmy in the elevator every day.  Last week it was, well, we got a replay this from last week, and then we got a new one.  You know what?  When Kenny shaves, he looks like a brontosaurus. 
[02:45:00]  He has a little brontosaurus head.  Can I get you something before I eat fruit off a tree?  Here's Frank DeFronter in the elevator with just a ton of people.  I had no idea he was taping this.  Good boy, Sam.  Yeah, and then Sam taped today, but here's from last week.  Listen to this.  The door's opening.  I'm the only little lady off, stupid. 
[02:45:30]  Do you know how it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile?  I was once informed by a man who was using my mouth as a pocket pussy.  Yeah, that was in front of strangers, by the way.  You hear the echo of the elevator.  It was fantastic.  A little off color.  It's so embarrassing to be part of.  I got a wishy-washy answer from Sam on this next one. 
[02:46:00]  Sam, Sam taped Jimmy today.  Well, it is just chewing, but it's long enough that you get the idea that he was continuously chewing for an entire elevator ride with several people.  Yeah, and a girl standing right next to him and just, like, laughing because it was so ridiculous.  Then she got creeped.  Yeah, and walked away from him.  In an elevator.  Yeah, that's him chewing his gum. 
[02:46:30]  Three.  Two.  Four.  Four. 
[02:47:00]  What a fucking jerk I sound like.  All right, well, Sam, you were correct.  A little wishy-washy.  I don't know.  I like the chewing.  I thought I had, like, a chewed to it.  This is how radio works.  We should have played that first, and then we leave him with the Frank the Frowner thing.  Yeah.  Big laugh.  Then, ah, it's a break.  Pew, pew, pew.  We'll be back with more.  Instead, we just do this.  Ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Sandy Kane. 
[02:47:30]  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:48:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, joining Sandy Kane, Mr. James Brown! 
[02:48:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Drink a six pack, turn off the lights, smoke some crack, I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore!  There is no you, there is only me. 
[02:49:30]  There is no you, there is only me.  There is no fucking you, there is only me.  There is no fucking you, there is only me.  I want to say hi to DJ Anal Lightball from Dallas.  He was confused on the other half of the Opie and Anthony show why I couldn't say his name on the radio.  Anal Lightbulb was confused. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, he was trashing me a little bit.  Trashing?  Tom from OAvirus.com.  Yvonne plus Benny Hill music equals radio gold.  Effing hilarious.  That was really funny.  That was good stuff.  All right.  Lots of instant feedback.  Lots of instant feedback today.  All right.  Why don't we get right into the phobia thing?  Yes.  Adam Ferrara sitting in, by the way. 
[02:50:30]  Playing Mohegan Sun?  Yeah.  July 14th and 15th.  Very nice.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we do the phobias here?  Scared of dogs.  We weren't even going to do this one, but after all the screaming we heard with the scared  of balloons and scared of birds, we're thinking this has got to be good as well.  A lot of people are scared of dogs.  I got a little scared of dogs thing, but I think it's got to be a freaking poodle or something  or a collie or something nice.  It's like when you see some big pit bull coming by and he's just kind of walking down the sidewalk 
[02:51:00]  and it takes an interest in you.  You start thinking, all right.  Then you got to think.  You got to start thinking, what do I do if it just comes running at me?  You got to start looking around.  Where am I going to go?  After I shit my pants.  Yeah.  They stand still.  Don't.  I know.  The hardest thing to do, they tell you to do.  Stand still.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Very good note of that.  You guys got a community.  Impossible.  You know what scares me?  You know the black of the Doverman Pinchers? 
[02:51:30]  The James Bond dogs?  Yeah.  Remember they throw the thing and they snap the fingers and then they eat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those scare me more than people.  Those are scary too.  You don't see as many of those on the street, though.  That's why it scares me.  That's scary shit, though.  That means someone sent them after you.  I got a dog phobia when they eat your prime rib.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have this fear that.  You got this fear of.  Yeah.  That a dog would eat my prime rib.  Thanks, Molly.  Kind of get some fur on your boot.  All right.  Here we go.  Maury Povich phobias.  After Maury, can we please read this?  Naima.  Read this. 
[02:52:00]  After Maury.  Of course.  Yes.  Okay.  This is the showstopper.  Where's mine?  All right.  I pity whoever took it.  E-Rock's MySpace blog.  Talking in movie theaters on the way.  Current mood.  Annoyed.  Remember, we did start this and then we ran out of the show.  All right.  Here we go.  Naima.  Scared of dogs.  Naima is definitely afraid of dogs.  She has a dog phobia.  And it has taken over her life. 
[02:52:30]  Now, stay right here.  I don't know.  What is the number?  Stay right here.  Please, please, please.  We had, how bad is it?  We went to her home to see how bad this was.  Watch.  My name is Naima and I am deftly afraid of dogs since I was about six or seven.  When I saw my sister being attacked by a dog, she tried to rip her arm off.  There was blood everywhere.  I hate all dogs because they are all evil demons that want to eat you.  Oh, she's obviously a dope, but her evil demons, are they? 
[02:53:00]  But I can understand why she's afraid of dogs.  That's the only one that made sense.  She's trying to absorb something.  She's her sister.  We get her arm ripped off.  Yeah, this is boring.  She's beaten by a balloon.  That's a legitimate fear.  Pickles, balloons, and birds.  This is a real legitimate one.  It's like, who's the black guy in L.A. Confidential?  Dogs ain't got defense.  God, Gabe.  The guy who shot the dogs?  See, the next clip is good because she fends off the...  We were just discussing what you would do when one of these dogs comes at you. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, what do you do?  Well, she's got a nice method.  All right.  This might get better.  She's crying and pissing herself here.  I make me some meat to take with me every day outside because I know that if I have the meat, I can throw it at the dogs and the dogs will go for the meat instead of meat.  She carries meat with her.  Every day she carries meat with her.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Cell phone, keys, cigarettes, ground chuck.  Okay, ready to go.  Great.  Watch it be a vegan dog.  Just attacks her. 
[02:54:00]  Meat is murder.  Instead of meat.  As soon as the sun begins to fall, I have a routine that I come in at night and I do.  I look out to make sure that there's no dogs out there because I really don't want the dogs to come in and get me.  I always put a pot in the glass underneath the window in case there's a dog coming in the window. 
[02:54:30]  Then he can't come in and get me.  And I make sure that my dog is blocked really well.  And that no dogs can get in.  After I make sure my entire house is completely secured, I come here and I try to sit here for some peace and quiet.  But I hear the dogs and I know they're coming to get me.  I just want to live my life like a normal person instead of always worrying about a dog coming to take you and kill me.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me. 
[02:55:00]  Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  You beast.  You savage.  Come on, bark like a dog for me.  Bark like a dog.  All right.  This one's boring.  At least it makes sense.  It's kind of funny.  Well...  I love hearing horrified people.  I don't know why that is.  She puts a pot of water under the window?  Yeah, what does that do?  So the dog can't get me. 
[02:55:30]  You're on the fourth floor, lady.  Dogs can't climb.  And I don't know nothing about burping no babies.  And I go upstairs and...  Well, actually, this clip does...  Yeah, we got a good one coming up.  But first this.  This quick one.  Your sister was bitten by a dog.  And that started...  Did that start the whole thing?  I was already a little afraid, but I wasn't as petrified as I am now.  Do you think, like, a five-pound dog could...  Ten-pound dog could... 
[02:56:00]  Yes, dogs have...  Little dogs have 11 more teeth than we do.  I didn't know that.  How come you know...  Yes, 11, because I've done my research.  No.  I've done my research.  That's great.  11 more teeth than a little dog.  What the hell is that teeth?  Too bad they didn't ask that question on the SATs.  You would have done a little better.  I'm just guessing.  Maury brings out some dogs, then.  She sounds like she's being hit with a taser.  Gene says that last clip, she whined like an Asian girl getting a face full of shit. 
[02:56:30]  Goddamn, she did, man.  To help her and dogs get along, we spread a little peanut butter on her cunt lips.  I love the tinkle on the plastic that you can hear as her face is being used as a turlet.  Say it again.  As he peed, that last quarter bladderful had to shoot out as his feces was fucking squeezed 
[02:57:00]  through onto her face.  That little tinkle involuntarily squirted out.  That's the downside of shitting on a face.  Tinkle will be present.  Here's more audio of the girl.  For many days, I didn't bring him here because I suffer when he bites me.  I'm in my vagina.  When I'm walking and he sees this other dog, he's right away.  He jump on my vagina because he gets so crazy.  He doesn't know who I am. 
[02:57:30]  He forgets everything.  And he bites the Labrador and his penis.  I don't want him to bite my Labrador and his penis.  My Labrador is a baby.  It's beautiful.  Is that Selma Hayek?  Here's the clip.  Maury brings out some dogs and she sounds like she's being hit with a taser.  Enjoy.  And you know you're going to have to confront your fears.  So let's just bring out one dog.  One dog.  How funny would it be if, like, you know, Maury brings out the dog as he drops to have a heart attack? 
[02:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  It would be the greatest thing ever.  It would be the greatest TV ever.  They should bring out, like, they'll probably bring out the poodles or whatever.  They should bring out, like, nasty attack dogs.  No, you know it's going to be right in the middle.  It's not quite a poodle.  A pooch.  It's right in the middle.  It'll be a pooch.  Like a Beethoven.  Black Lab or something.  The lap dog.  A whining rhymer.  I hate them.  Hey, what's wrong with those dogs?  Nothing.  It's their name I hate.  Oh, I'm the rhymer. 
[02:58:30]  Now, you know you're going to have to confront your fears.  I'm a mariner, I think, no?  So let's just bring out a wonder.  It's a bond.  One dog.  What?  See you.  No!  What happened?  What happened to the piece of meat?  What happened to the piece of meat? 
[02:59:00]  You want to give the dog a piece of meat?  Huh?  Oh, God.  No, please, please.  Please, please, please, please.  Oh, God, please.  Please, please.  Come on out here.  Come out here.  I'm here.  You are not alone.  There are a lot of people who don't like dogs, okay?  A lot of people.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's enough.  That's enough.  That's enough.  Clap her.  Clap her. 
[02:59:30]  Got her by the throat.  I love it.  She's tearing the pussy off her.  We'll be back right after this.  We'll be back.  Maury's a sick fuck.  All right.  Bring out the old-time state police and some fire hoses and some German shepherds.  Tell her to try to walk into a college.  Don't give you something to be scared of.  Scared of dogs.  Wow.  God, is that good?  Wow.  She was petrified.  I love Maury. 
[03:00:00]  Please, please.  She's begging.  Let's say hi to, uh, hmm, yeah, Hammy in New York.  Hammy.  Yeah, Hammy in the Poconos.  All right.  I just wanted to tell you guys that lady sounds like Celine Dion trying to rescue the Katrina  victims.  Bring the dog, bring her a kayak so she doesn't have to get it back by the dogs.  Okay, give me the car crash.  No.  No.  No. 
[03:00:30]  No.  That's too good for you.  Just hang up in shame, sir.  Yes, sir.  Goodbye.  Mike brings up a great point.  How you doing, Mike?  What do you say, Bill?  Mike.  Yeah, I love how she decides on 11 more teeth.  Like, they've got one extra tooth on the top right side, and then Maury doesn't even call  her on it.  Yeah, you know something?  She said that the dog's got 11 more teeth than people.  We all have to have an even number of teeth on each side. 
[03:01:00]  How is a dog have one big one in the middle?  I'm a dopey bitch.  I did my research on two faces.  Yeah.  That was a good one, too.  Let's say hi to Steve in North, uh, North, Jesus, New Hampshire.  Steve, what's up?  You know what would be the best part if he got this bitch over her phobia, and then she  went home and pet two rabid pit bulls and got fucking mauled.  Oh, there's Frank the Frowner's hairdo right there. 
[03:01:30]  That's it.  That's it.  Frank the Frowner's hairdo.  The UN Ambassador John Bolton.  That's Frank the Frowner's do.  Frank the Frowner's going to make an appearance at the Traveling ONA virus.  I don't know.  I've been in constant touch with him.  I'm not sure if he'll show up.  That is the hair.  That's his hairdo.  Go to opianthony.com for all the info on the Traveling ONA virus.  That Captain Kangaroo mustache, too, that guy's got.  That's the fucking worst wig.  That wig, this guy, I bet you he eats salad out of that when he's not wearing it. 
[03:02:00]  That fucking wok do is horrendous.  It's a different color than his real hair by, like, 30 shades.  Holy shit.  Why do we send that man as an ambassador anywhere?  He should be the ambassador to the Dateline special on pedophilia.  What an embarrassing asshole.  Einstein face.  Yeah, Mark Twain.  Exactly, Kev.  He's got those round glasses.  Yeah.  Fucking white mustache, white eyebrows, and Burt Reynolds 77 hairdo.  Fucking cunt. 
[03:02:30]  Like the fucking watch a horse kick that wig off.  With a nail in its shoe.  Let's get into E-Rock's MySpace blog.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, now.  Good.  Time for some interesting reading.  Got it right on top.  E-Rock, you can't leave.  E-Rock, where are you going?  Oh.  All right.  Eric's not leaving.  All right.  He's going to take it like a man.  E-Rock, sit down, kiddo.  Just because he's sitting there, Rope, it doesn't mean he's going to take it like a man. 
[03:03:00]  Believe me.  That's right.  He'll take it like a boy.  As soon as we said E-Rock's MySpace blog, he got up, but I thought he was fleeing the area.  Yeah.  Talking in movie theaters.  Current mood.  Annoyed.  Now, how many blogs have you done so far?  I think about four.  Four blogs on various subjects covering what?  Movies.  This one is, what else?  Just other stuff going on.  Other stuff going on in your life?  What?  The Gowanus.  What are you?  Men.  No, thanks.  Men.  Men.  Well, just everyday stuff going on. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Like.  Like.  Going.  Music industry.  All right.  Music industry.  I'll leave it to Than to just get every single one of them.  Very good, Than.  What's going on?  What were his other blogs about?  North Korea.  I just want to get a feel for what he's writing about.  Why would it be on?  Check.  All right.  Mr. T versus Chuck Norris.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  Whoa. 
[03:04:00]  That was going on.  But I wanted to know when were you vacationing in faggot town that that was going on.  Holy shit.  You did not.  Monday, April 10th, 2006.  Screw this one.  Mr. T versus Chuck Norris.  Current mood.  Content.  Content.  My buddy, Mike has this new list posted on his blog.  Mr. T versus Chuck Norris.  It's a hoot.  You wrote, it's a hoot?  It's a hoot.  And say hi to Mike as well.  Here, go to that.  What's the Mr. T versus Chuck Norris thing? 
[03:04:30]  It's a hoot.  What made you a hoot?  Oh, my God.  You did not fall for one of these stupid emails.  No.  These cut and paste Chuck Norris thing.  Anytime I see something, I get the Chuck Norris thing.  Did you write a blog on why chocolate is better than men?  Chocolate never talks back to you.  I just made a fortune from Nigeria.  Somebody left me millions.  This is like chicken soul for the douche.  Chicken soul?  Oh, God damn it.  God damn it. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, he was enjoying the praise, too, man.  That was a good one.  You were enjoying it.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Chicken soul.  Maybe that's why the great physicist doesn't want to hang out with you.  Back goes Riffy looking up.  And it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's all so long.  My mistake.  I know Dr. Cock who would have known the answer to that.  I'm a bag of jizz.  That's who I am.  Sit down, have a nice, hot cup of chicken soul. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, God almighty.  E-Rock, be honest with me.  You want to do some soup searching next time you try to come up with a fucking joke?  I want to watch Soup Train and dance.  Be honest with us.  Yeah, exactly.  From your head down to the soup seer shoes.  Did you really think this was a hoot?  It was all right.  What, were you on an island?  It was so much hootable. 
[03:06:00]  On an island, you were the soup survivor?  Were you going to suggest that we read this on the air?  No.  Well, if it was a hoot, wouldn't you bring it to our attention so we could make some good radio out of it?  Share the hootness.  Exactly.  It wasn't that kind of a hoot.  No.  It was just something stupid to read online.  It made you chuckle?  A little.  A little bit?  All right.  Like this made you chuckle.  Did it warm your soup?  All right.  Mr. T and Chuck Norris.  If Mr. T pitied a fool at the same time Chuck Norris' roundhouse kicked him in the face,  the world would implode.  I want to know where the hoot is. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, where's the hoot?  Where's the hoot in that?  That's it?  Dan's got the hoot.  That's the whole thing?  I don't, yeah, that's like, that's one thing.  That's where I would stop reading.  I wouldn't give this thing another, a second chance here.  Where's the hoot?  I don't know.  Where's the hoot in Iran?  I don't know.  Is it a time release hoot?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hootness in later paragraphs.  Oh, there's a list of things that would happen if they fought. 
[03:07:00]  All right, well.  Right.  All right, what's the second one?  Because they're both so badass.  Can we get them printed out real quick?  Is that possible?  Why don't we get the second one here?  What's the second one?  All right.  Because maybe the first one wasn't much of a hoot.  You're saying the first one may have been a warm-up, Bo.  All right, the second one.  On the A-team face, Hannibal and Murdoch were all masters of disguise.  Mr. T didn't have to wear a disguise.  The bad guys didn't recognize him out of fear.  I can see a little laugh there.  Oh, my God.  Number three, there are only four horsemen of the apocalypse. 
[03:07:30]  It's Yvonne.  Yvonne.  Of the apocalypse.  Because Mr. T is going to walk.  We're tanks for nothing.  So far, not even a chortle or a smirk.  I don't know how you got hoot.  It's building towards disdain.  Mr. T once shook hands with Chuck Norris, or so it appeared.  In actuality, their combined power caused an earthquake, which gave their hands a look of shaking to any onlookers who were probably too scared to accurately testify anyway. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Adam just winged the newspaper.  You know what else had that effect?  When Michael J. Fox shook Hepburn's hands.  You know what happened?  There was this Chuck Norris thing that happened a few months back that came out of nowhere, was mildly entertaining for a minute because it was new. 
[03:08:30]  Now people are trying to come up with new things for a joke that is, like, done.  You couldn't have promised a hoot.  It's not really a hoot.  Maybe the hoot's coming.  All right.  Let me keep going.  You may be judging this, too.  There may be a big laugh on the horizon.  All right.  All right.  Mr. T invented fools.  Realizing the magnitude of his folly, he then created pity.  I'm wondering what your head would look like with my fist in it.  Twenty-three. 
[03:09:00]  Skidoo.  That's the number of people Mr. T has pitied in the time it has taken you to read this sentence.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, wow.  You really want to work for a morning zoo.  I can feel it.  This is morning zoo stuff.  Has Whoopi returned your resume?  Call it whatever he is doing.  Oh, wow.  You know what I meant.  I don't know.  I'm just tired and scared.  Oh, you're a good zoo.  All right.  We all have copies of this.  Mr. T once punched Chuck Norris at the exact moment he roundhouse kicked Mr. T in the chest. 
[03:09:30]  The result was the 80s.  I'm looking to see E-Rock's lips.  They're not moving up in a smile fashion.  Mr. T is allergic to doorknobs.  That's why he can only kick through doors.  Mr. T's pity for fools is used by mathematicians as a demonstration of the concept of infinity.  Mr. T once pity the sun and Ice Age followed. 
[03:10:00]  Mr. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T 
[03:10:30]  on all  3,428 instances  that's a funny number though  that's a funny number  it occurred  when Mr. T and Chuck Norris both deflowered the same woman  the resulting spermal battles  have caused the woman's uterus to explode  in a flurry of pity and roundhouse  kicks  imagine those same battles were fought on your back and chin  weren't they  Mr. T once rocked the casbah 
[03:11:00]  which explains why there is no longer  a casbah  could someone else continue  what are you eight  the last time Mr. T went to McDonald's  or as he would call it Matt Donald's  Ronald McDonald greeted him  what occurred next  proved to be the most violent beating of a clown  ever recorded in human history  it's unfortunate  he didn't walk into XM and meet an associate producer  Mr. T is not black  it's just that the sun is afraid to shine on him 
[03:11:30]  there better be a hoot in the next five lines  or you're losing teeth son  this couldn't be funny  if it was written by solely sales  that tops mine  I'm reading this from soul to nuts  but that was better  look up in the way 
[03:12:00]  it's solar man  alright  up in the way  yeah up in the way you got it  look up in the way  instead of up in the sky  I'm a dumb cunt  up in the way  whatever that faggot would say  when he flew away before his wheelchair  despite popular beliefs  if there is a fool in the woods  and nobody is around to hear his jibba jabba  Mr. T is still able to pity him  I actually hate you right now  jibba jabba  jibba jabba  another instant feedback coming in 
[03:12:30]  this is absolutely hootless  there's not a hoot to be found  Mr. T was fired from the Psychic Friends Network  for always predicting pain  the fact that Mr. T is like  uses like a kind of a cool tough figure  before Mr. T the alphabet only had 25 letters  yeah  did it have a D, an O, a U, a C, an H, or an E?  how about a B, an A, or a G?  did it have those letters?  both Mr. T and Chuck Norris think  E-Rock is a homo 
[03:13:00]  Mr. T made his van go twice the speed of light  because he wanted to prove that quantum physics  was a bunch of jibba jabba  jibba jabba  jibba jabba  jibba jabba again  again  and it ties in mocking Dr. Cahu's livelihood  which I don't care for  no  good friend  Mr. T was originally cast to play Arnold Jackson  on Different Strokes  uh oh  I wonder if Linda Stacey is strapping in for this one 
[03:13:30]  unfortunately every time he said  what you talking about Willis  Willis shit himself  that's kind of funny  so  number 24 out of 25  is kind of funny  yeah  not a hoot  approaching a hoot  that's pretty funny  not a hoot  every time Mr. T pities the fool  the porn star regains her virginity  then proceeds to lose it to Mr. T  well there goes that laugh  whatever  sucked out in the vacuum of horribleness  that you thought to link to  because according to you  this is fucking Woody Allen's latest novel 
[03:14:00]  well thanks E-Rock  that was wonderful  no problem  that was good  that was good  let's say hi to uh  uh Caleb  Caleb  Caleb  yeah go ahead  how do you say your name  Yvonne  yeah Yvonne whatever  hey Jimmy's gotta end with that scientist now  because he's discovered a black hole  a black hole of funny  from which not even light humor can escape  what the uh  the list 
[03:14:30]  yeah  alright we're gonna have to regroup now unfortunately  and then we're gonna get into  he's spiraled it  E-Rock's MySpace blog  talking in movie theaters  next  hey this is Frank Vincent  hi everybody this is Travis Tritt  hey folks my name is Henry Rowland  hey what up y'all  this is Tracy Morgan  hey this is Tommy Chong  and you're listening to Pot Talk  hey this is Richard Dreyfuss  and you're listening to OPNN  I love this  please refrain from the word cunt  I know you want  August  August  August

[03:15:30]  he has a little power  and he wants to use it  yeah a little power  nobody else  it's us and the Steinway fucking people  and the economists  so he talks shit to us  we have like little things sticking out the window  so we can broadcast the walkover  and cunt face  superintendent  uh  the fucking  faggoty mustache  and the awful glasses  is uh  that's not distracting  is um  it's 15 minutes a day too  he's a cunt  that it's out there  it's 15 minutes  a day  for the walk  that it's out by the window  and then  and then it gets pulled in

[03:16:30]  little power thing  you should get a raise  because he's doing a great job  of being an asshole  they're fake power basically  I kept that dish  out of the windows  god damn it  yeah  it's me  you know that dish  that used to be up there  I kept it out  he's the same guy  as works over at  92.3  he's the same guy  that works the security there  he's the same fucking  jerk off  that works  as a fucking traffic cop  not a real cop  the traffic people  that's who he is  he's the ones  that used to be called  brownies  when they used to walk around  in brown uniforms  handing out parking tickets  and they got no respect 
[03:17:00]  at all  and they called them brownies  and now  they have a uniform  that kind of  looks a little similar  to the New York police  looks just like one  without the gun  yeah  so now they  think they  they are actually cops  which they're not  you're still fucking brownies  handing out parking tickets  I told you  I mumbled by one  when I had that problem  I was so angry  when I walked by the guy  I fucking mumbled  you're not a real cop  fuck cocksucker  I mumbled cocksucker  and I told you  I'd pull up to him  in my car  and he wouldn't let me through  and a real cop would've 
[03:17:30]  and I'm like  you're not a real cop  are you  and they love hearing that  and he goes  I'm a police officer  I'm an officer  in the traffic division  you're a square bitch  shut up  you're not a cop  stupid  the callers should go  to the phones  everyone knows  somebody like this  they have that fake power  that they have to use  fake power  they feel like  they have some kind of authority  or a very small  power base  I had to catch a ferry  over the holiday weekend  and I get there 
[03:18:00]  catch it  I literally got there  like  daunting task  I set some traps  five minutes to spare tops  and the ticket lady  you know  I got the tickets in advance  and everything  I already paid for them  and she goes  you're supposed to be here  a half hour  before the ferry takes off  I'm like  well I would have been  if I wasn't stuck in traffic  it's not a plane  you asshole  like I really wanted  to be here  like five to seven minutes  before the ferry takes off 
[03:18:30]  and have all this anxiety  like I'm gonna miss  literally the only ferry  for the next three or four hours  yeah  so she's giving me  all this shit  and then she's like  she gives me the tickets  she goes  I don't even know  why I'm giving you  these tickets  I don't even think  they're gonna let you  on the ferry  they're paid for tickets  how about you  just give them to me  idiot  she was in the power position  and she felt like  she had to show  a little power  like she was in charge  and I was breaking  some bizarre rule  if you had to tell me  that happened to me  on a plane  American Airlines  you know the computer check in  yeah  40 minutes  if you're under 40 minutes

[03:25:00]  you know what I mean  it was good humor  on the side  a little chuckle  got nothing  alright  it wasn't a racial reference  it was about just  the fucking behavior  and the idiocy  of these toll people  so you like that  what about the cunt run  did that make you  was that a hoot to you  that was kind of a hoot  for me  wah wah penis  wah wah penis  alright let's go to  Dave in Tennessee  what's up with Tennessee  today man  what's up  I grew up in Buffalo  and those border guards  going into Canada  even before 9-11 
[03:25:30]  on their power trip  they had a hair up their ass  oh my god  you're so right  they'll rip your car apart  you're so right  you gotta like  you gotta play it perfect  to jerk off  not a smile on their face  they get off in the fact  that you're freaking out  and nervous  that you're going over the border  because something happens  when you go over the border  you know you don't have  any marijuana or anything  but all of a sudden  you feel like  that guilt thing  yeah all of a sudden  you feel like  you got something in your car  oh and they're brutal  and they play up to that  so much  oh yeah they do  and the worst you're gonna have 
[03:26:00]  is a case of a bat  in the back  right  and then coming back  over to the states  I've never had a problem  I heard the US Border Patrol  could be a motherfucker  but I've come back in  I guess because I'm so comfortable  coming back into my own country  from whatever shitbox  I've been in  I fucking  I'm Kenny Comfortable  talking  look at my bag  do what you want  fucking check my anus  whatever you need  please  please  feel free  punch it out guys  I never have a problem  getting back into the state  I think they can sense  when you're just fucking  so happy to be there 
[03:26:30]  yeah  alright let's go to  Don in Rockland  Don what's up  guys  John Sterling  made a great call  last night  Milky Cabrera  hit a  grand slam  what's his name  and he followed it up  with  the milk man  always knocks twice  no he didn't  stop it  he did  stop it  Milky Cabrera  Milky Cabrera  hit a grand slam  and John Sterling  said the milk man  always knocks twice  a base is loaded  a base is loaded  one out  it'll be a 1-0 to Cabrera  who singled in a run 
[03:27:00]  his first time  pitch  swung on  and hit of the air  to deep right  that ball is high  it is far  it is  gone  it's a grand slam  the milk man  always knocks twice  Milky Cabrera  has grand slammed  hit of the right  center field bleachers  and the Yankees  take out  5-1 lead  wonderful  does anyone know  what he said  the other night  when the Yankees  were playing the Mets 
[03:27:30]  and A-Rod  hit the grand slam  hopefully my chest hurts  there's tightness  in my right arm  punch it out guys  because I know  he had a  I was at the game  and I'm like  all I could think of  is what is this ass  saying  and the bottom line  is if you listen  to that call  I love the way  he'll call a home run  when it's legitimately  not sure if it's gone  like yeah  that's a great  excited home run call  why do you  fucking spoil it  the milk man  always delivers  twice  Milky  it started great 
[03:28:00]  and he fucking  ruins it  Jesus  it's high enough  it's long enough  I'm an asshole  but it did start off  I don't like  when he does that  not as high  not as far  not as far  not as far  enough  but I like when  it's a legitimate  high as far  like it is  you know  you know the difference  like those close ones  that was a great call  until he fucking  had to throw  his own little take on it  biggest stupid  Steinbrenner loves that 
[03:28:30]  and his senility  I'm sure he does  I like when you do that  I like that thing you do  when you make stuff up  about the players  and each time  no matter who it is  who had to come up  with something funny  can you rhyme  can you rhyme  yeah  okay  how about if you  fucking came up  with some really  great stuff  like uh  the ex-steroid user  goes deep  or how about  one of them  the alleged  wife beater  goes back to back  and a belly to belly  and a fist to socket  that's a single  for the cocaine addict 
[03:29:00]  treated that ball  like her eyeball  smack that ball  cause the bitch  won't listen  it's a grand slam  for married  to a white girl  this one's not gonna  make Jimmy happy  oh no  I'll be  oh no  oh no  I like being happy  and uh  it might be  pest time  but when someone  has to confirm this  Mark Silverstein

[03:42:00]  i'd like to speak  to opie  can opie come  out  all right let's  go uh talking  in movie theaters  with uh  uh  scott and todd  it's eroc's  myspace blog  oh god where is  it now again  here it is  talking in movie  theaters  current mood  annoyed this is  our own eroc  with an observation  that is very similar  to anthony's  observation which  he he obviously  uh says in his  yes what are you  in his myspace blog  sam's filming what  are you filming  what could this  possibly be used  for later on  i'm filming eroc's 
[03:42:30]  reaction to all  this  yeah  okay  how about actually  putting something  up on the fucking  website that's  worthwhile instead  of filming everything  like take take one  bit of time where  you'd be filming and  actually put up  something like the  walk where the  fucking chick was  with jimmy with  the chain up on  the fucking  that has to be  up on the site  or something that  happened here in  the studio where  some chick got a  fucking bat up her  ass put that up  on a way like i  fucking read through  message boards and  go they tape 
[03:43:00]  everything i never  see shit there  were steve how  many things are  actually up on the  website there's  three videos not  pictures we want  ten year old  fucking girls  cunt face to get  in here right now  there's three new  videos up today  three new videos  up today including  bob kelly puking  okay from jim norton's  there's a lot of  money  frank the frowner  interviewing people  on the walk over  frank the frowner on  the walk  very good  uh... jimmy destroying  his derrick jeter gift  bag  oh that was good  that was good too  sure 
[03:43:30]  uh... tomorrow  we'll have  bob kelly puking at  pat from unaki's  asshole  that's not bad  that's a week  we're looking at a  week turnaround time  on this fucking  video  the w david's walk  over has been up  for a while  with the  hello steve  steve why does it  take so long for  videos to get up on  foundry  uh... you mean  actually from the  date that they  happen  yeah yeah like  it has to do with  whoever's editing  them sometimes they  can happen day of 
[03:44:00]  sometimes it takes a  while it really  depends who gets  them who gets a  hold of the  yeah but i mean  it can be done  really quickly  it can if we had  i think if we  we're not looking  for we're not  looking for fucking  fade-ins and you  know and titles  but they look good  just like whammo  here's the video  throw it up there  what didn't get  done quickly  no i'm just saying  like every time  something happens i  usually see like a  shitload of emails  and stuff and go  where the fuck is  the video of  and it's whatever  like the exception  of this past weekend  where everybody was  pretty much taking  their time we've 
[03:44:30]  had them up night  of or morning after  steve do you have  a viral video  section because  viral videos are  all the rage  we have latest  downloads and the  video i know but  those go away really  fast and there's a  lot of viral videos  that happen on this  show that i think  people would really  enjoy um if it was  an actual viral video  section where you  knew these were the  top unbelievable  videos that are being  uh sent to everybody  all over the world  who judges the tops  though you mean they  get voted on you  don't have to vote  and do that it's just  the obvious ones that  people uh certainly 
[03:45:00]  want to see over and  over again we could  do hence viral  videos we could do  that we do we  generally link them  up the day like  i'm just saying  because all these  websites are just  there was another  article in the paper  yesterday about viral  videos taking over the  world it's the hottest  thing right now and i  know we have a lot of  videos that are very  viral we're actually  nature but the  problem is like what  happens on foundry  music if you don't  catch a certain thing  it just kind of  disappears and now you  have to use a search  engine to find that  that video i would make  it easier for people  that we could do top  downloads we could do 
[03:45:30]  stuff like that it's  all stuff that yeah  it's doable  just those obvious  viral videos like the  guy getting stung in  the ball bag by the  bee you know uh the  guy uh slamming his  nutsack in in the  mousetraps those viral  videos that people  and you know it's not  hard to do that  constitutes viral  well that's the  problem there's a  different deal like  with there's see  foundry's got one set  of criteria and then  you'll see other viral  video sites with their  own set of criteria and  theirs their top ones  might really stink no  so it's uh nothing's  wrong just stay in the  living room handle it  maybe you just like 
[03:46:00]  but i don't want to  talk to myself  maybe just uh i don't  know call it the top  you know viral videos  and you can figure it  out on your own you  don't need to have a  whole voting tank  what's my problem you're  in my fucking house  oh you're just gonna be  a little nasty with you  there oh  where'd you get the  clean audio  what are you doing in  my house  acting  it's one of these  soon to be beaten  little farts  you went and got the  clean audio  get the fuck out  that was really  emoting  wasn't it really  by the way people 
[03:46:30]  why not  people want eroc to  well it's just a  thought steve because  i know viral videos  are taking over the  world that's all  yeah we could do  that  what was that  why not  that's fucking  why not  how do you talk so  devoid of emotion  it's months of  practice  why not  why not  because a lot of  the videos people  why not it's like a  Cylon  people want to check  out you know  and then and then  they don't even care  about them ever again  but then there's the  other ones that are  like oh my god i want  to show my friend  blank but i can't  find it on foundry  because i don't know  how to search for it  so i'm just emailing 
[03:47:00]  in eroc current mood  homosexual  all right  people want eroc to  read his own blog  yeah it's got to be  in his voice  so it's eroc's  myspace blog  it's uh titled  talking in movie theaters  just saw x-men 3  wasn't a big fan  of the movie  not as good as the  others but this  posting isn't about  that on the show  there was an old  bit where anthony  went to see  mission impossible  2 and people  wouldn't shut up  in the movie theater  i happen to be in 
[03:47:30]  a theater in the  same area where  that event had  taken place  several years later  the same situation  occurred  no you have to  read same the  way it's written  several years later  several years later  and the same  situation occurred  over the years  i've tried to take  notice of other  people doing uh  other people doing  the same thing  yet it all comes  down to one  group  i was trying to  approach this  carefully but there  is no way to do  so  black people need  to shut up in  movie theaters  wow  wow 
[03:48:00]  whoa  whoa  whoa  seriously  shut up  people paying  i just  people paying  for this movie  aren't paying  for your commentary  nor your reactions  especially when  you repeat the  dialogue or  describe the  scene that just  happened  what is wrong  with you  at one point in  the movie there  was an obvious  attempt to coin a  catchphrase by  having one of the  characters say  i'm the juggernaut  bitch 
[03:48:30]  really are you  and then i  referenced jim  norton  right next to him  attaboy hawk  right after the  line about four  people one being  an obnoxious  preteen girl saying  that line for the  next five minutes  and she said  why is the  popcorn feel all  buttery at the  bottom  why is  what's sticking  through the  popcorn it  feels like the  luckiest monster  it's a pickle  at this point 
[03:49:00]  i've had it  i don't know  at this point i've  had enough and  did the stupid  sound her head  oh so you  didn't uh  bitch at the  black people  you you you  were a real man  and went after  after the preteen  girl  yeah  good one  yeah  i should talk  like us going  after the  progeria game  i know  who are we  kidding  uh her head  sunk into her  neck sideways  and gave me one  of those oh no  you didn't eyes  whatever  ten minutes  tough talk hawk  whatever  ten minutes  later  did i say that  right wait a minute 
[03:49:30]  wait a tough talk  yeah you're having  way to tough talk  hawk  well wait a tough  it actually works  with a tough talk  hawk  but i did say it  wrong  yeah  i'm a whole ass  you're still a good  soup  someone  we didn't get  to him  they're like  i didn't know  uh fred the  flubber was  doing a radio  show with you  guys today  you know it  takes more  muscles to smile  than it does  to frown  i know that  just intuition  all right 
[03:50:00]  continue there  after the  whatever  because that's  that's tough  talk there  exactly  ten minutes  later she's  at it again  as is most  of the crowd  what is  what is in  you people  that forces  you to  be complete  annoyances  to the rest  of society  by doing  this  before the  movie  they play  messages  to turn  off your  cell phone  and that  silence  is golden  and that's  in quotes  how about  one of  those  if the  lights  are lowered  and all  you see  are eyes  and teeth  that means  shut up  and enjoy  the show  if they 
[03:50:30]  ever do  another  x-men  movie  may i  suggest  a new  character  named  silent  night  a black  person  with the  ability  to sit  silently  in  public  gatherings  yeet  that wasn't  that bad  I like  the silent  night  me too  it wasn't  really a hoot  I like  when he  said whatever  that showed  defiance  and rage  that wasn't  badhawk  we gave you  a business  over nothing  you're a good  writer  write another  blog  we'll get  to it

[04:02:00]  Opie and Anthony are older than me  what they do is easy voyeuristic radio  I think it's unsellable  unsellable huh?  really  CBS radio seems to think  oh what a tool this guy  and wait for the new markets  that we're going to be announcing soon  you tool  just uh yeah  hang on there man cock  and why don't you talk  uh to your audience  about how they uh  they haven't re-signed you yet  and you're starting to panic  and you're calling CBS radio  for a job  by the way this is from  prnewswire.com  yeah  it's like a public relations  um 
[04:02:30]  yeah  site  that you can  you can send in your own shit  yeah  so you can write up your own pr  and send it in  hmm  really  that's fantastic  that's what he's down to  why does it  someone call uh man cow  I guess he's still on the radio  and ask him uh  when he's going to talk to his audience  about how he's uh  he doesn't have a contract  and the company hasn't re-signed him yet  and it's not looking good  and he actually called Steve Dahl  and left a message on Steve Dahl's answer machine  begging uh Steve Dahl  to help him get into CBS radio  use that against man cow 
[04:03:00]  and see if he's honest with his audience  he says he's not a shock jock  that he doesn't uh  do things  shock  things  or say things  simply for ratings  and or effect  didn't you  didn't you let a cow loose  on a bridge  or something  didn't you have a haircut  in the middle of a highway  typical hack  shock jock  he's one of these shock jocks  that likes to  he's trying to  make everyone forget  that he actually did  that type of radio  yeah  he's trying to change  he's trying to be Sean Hannity
