<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of the arrest of two individuals dressed as Superman and Batman in Times Square for resisting arrest and assault.  Superman, identified as Maxim Katznelson, physically assaulted a police officer. This segued into a conversation about the upcoming 2014 Super Bowl in the New York/New Jersey area, focusing on potential weather problems, particularly the possibility of a blizzard.  The hosts then reminisced about the New York Giants' stadium history, including a Bon Jovi concert celebrating the new stadium's opening.  They recounted a humorous story about a guest, Florentine, who, despite being molested as a child, was more concerned about the wrestling pictures he received as compensation. This story was nominated as "bit of the week."

A caller from St. Louis expressed enthusiasm for the Super Bowl's cold-weather location, preferring it to dome stadiums. The discussion continued to the Super Bowl halftime show and speculation about performers, followed by a digression into Justin Bieber's haircut and potential baldness.  Further debate about the Super Bowl's location and potential problems, including the possibility of a terrorist attack (with the hosts jokingly brainstorming various attack scenarios), ensued.  The hosts also discussed oddly named New York City streets, and fielded calls from listeners debating the merits of a domed stadium and expressing concerns about the impact of cold weather on the Super Bowl experience.  The segment concluded with a discussion about the unresolved plot points and lingering questions of the television show "Lost,"  with a lengthy list of unanswered questions recited. Finally, they discussed issues with past interns and edits made to older broadcast material due to concerns about unpaid advertising.

The show then shifted to a furious rant about their superiors, particularly someone named Gary, editing segments of the show without their consent.  The edits specifically targeted segments featuring graphic descriptions of defecation, including a detailed account by Jim of his own bowel movement and another involving Pat Duffy brushing his teeth with dog feces. Opie and Anthony vehemently argued that these descriptions, while graphic, were well within the bounds of satellite radio, citing comparable content in films like *Slumdog Millionaire*, *Schindler's List*, and *Caddyshack*, as well as television shows like *The Office* and *American Pie*. They highlighted the absurdity of censoring verbal descriptions while visual depictions of similar subject matter are widely accepted.  The hosts questioned Gary's understanding of their comedic style and suspected overzealous adherence to obscenity laws as the motive for the edits.  Numerous listener calls provided further examples of similar content in other media, supporting the hosts' argument.  They expressed concern that other bits, including one involving a diaper-clad Paul and a segment featuring "Homeless Charlie," might also be targeted for edits.  Beyond the hosts, no specific guests were mentioned in studio, though a potential "babysitter" representing station management was alluded to. The overall tone of this segment was one of intense frustration and anger over the censorship.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I know we have a lot to do today, but could one person call and explain why the cops were battling Superman and Batman in Times Square yesterday?  I've read the article twice, and I don't understand this.  I'll tell you why.  And I don't even know what the story is.  Nope.  Don't know the story, but I'll tell you exactly why.  Okay.  Because Times Square is turning into Nutville again. 
[00:00:30]  It's turning into kooky town again, like it was before the economy got good and then before it went to shit again.  That's impossible.  They got beach chairs out there.  Exactly.  It's the dumbest thing.  It's turning into a wacky, wackyville.  Oh, that's a female cop.  Okay, they're tackling Superman, and they got Batman all cuffed up on one of the freaking lawn chairs. 
[00:01:00]  Look at the cop.  How come superheroes are so easy to conquer in real life?  The cops get them, like, easily.  Biff Wham Pow is the headline.  Yeah.  It's on the front page.  The front page of the paper is talking about this.  The Man of Steel didn't go down with just two officers.  It took seven officers to get Superman down.  He was putting up a good fight.  Little kids were like, Mommy, it's Superman. 
[00:01:30]  I guess they were a little, you know, little kids probably going to get upset.  Right.  If that wasn't weird enough, the Dark Knight was handcuffed in a chair like a common villain.  But as it was happening, someone was like, it's Batman.  Is it?  Do people not realize these are just lunatics in suits?  Is it really Batman?  Just lunatics in suits.  The Batman character didn't even go the distance and put on a, you know, a face thing. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And Superman looks ridiculous.  Yeah, let's see.  It looks ridiculous.  Superman, a.k.a.  Maxim Katznelson, 23, of the Bronx.  He was arrested and charged with assault and resisting arrest.  Police said he punched a female cop in the face while she was trying to subdue him.  Okay.  And the cop is fine after being punched by Superman?  Amazing.  She must have had some kryptonite. 
[00:02:30]  I'm still looking for the reason.  All right, their comic book adventure went awry when cops approached the Dynamic Duo on 43rd Street  to see whether they had the required license to perform in costume in public.  When they said no, cops asked for IDs.  Again, they answered no, which prompted them to handcuff Batman.  That's when Superman took off, screaming, I'm not getting arrested. 
[00:03:00]  Just like the real Superman.  I'm not getting arrested.  But a crowd of police took him down and brought him to a special Fortress of Solitude,  the Midtown South Station House.  Oh, get it?  Meanwhile, Batman left with another costume character.  Said Melba Williams, a tourist from Tennessee.  He walked off with the Statue of Liberty.  I guess this needed to be on page three of my paper today.  Yeah, I guess the Michael Jackson thing's calmed down enough where they don't need 20 pages. 
[00:03:30]  Not really.  Well, maybe they don't need 20 pages.  They could put Superman and Batman on the page two.  I'm more concerned that the world is getting close to blowing up,  and they have a story about Superman and Batman.  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.  I'm on.  I know.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  Wait forever.  I know.  Now, I'm about to see you.  Go questions.  Please know.  Andic Lackley says he had a meeting. 
[00:04:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back toịch但是.  We'll be right back.  I know.  We'll be right back.  And the Сам desannetzes.  That's the camera.  That's the camera.  And that's the camera.  We'll be right back to Congress.  That's the camera.  Good Lord.  We'll FINUS alles.  Keep the camera.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, my God. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal. 
[00:07:30]  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up.  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  Get it.  Get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:08:00]  Good morning.  Hi.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  So, New York slash New Jersey gets the Super Bowl in 2014.  How annoyed is Jersey?  That it's got to be New York slash New Jersey.  Well, now they're arguing.  What's in New Jersey?  Because the Jets play there and the Giants play there.  So, they're like, well, it's actually, it's got to be Jersey, right?  They're New York teams.  They call themselves New York teams.  The Giants have NY on their fucking helmets. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  It's New York.  But they play in Jersey.  But they play in Jersey.  It's like a, you know, a New England Patriots thing.  They play in Massachusetts, but they are not the Massachusetts Patriots.  No.  So, this is kind of a tri-state Giants, bi-state Giants and Jets.  It's also weird that they have to share a stadium. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  The old days, the Jets played out on Long Island, and I forgot where the Giants played.  Did they play where they were, I guess?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm going way back, right?  Yeah.  The Giants have been playing in the Meadowlands for many, many years, I'm assuming.  I would assume.  I mean, we're talking decades, right?  I'm not sure of the history there.  I think it's a great move.  It's not a surprising move.  I think everyone knew that the NFL, they were going to pull the trigger and do this  and have a Super Bowl in a cold climate. 
[00:09:30]  What the hell?  Why not?  Why not mix it up a little bit, finally?  That was their big thing.  That was their big thing is it was a cold climate, and they've never done that with the Super Bowl.  They want this covered stadiums or warm weather.  It had to be above 50 degrees.  Yeah, but they made a big exception, and New York's got it, and I can only hope there's a blizzard that day.  Oh, what I love if just a giant snowstorm came in and everyone had a play in the snow. 
[00:10:00]  Well, if that's the case, I bet you more people would watch, too, because it only affects the people that are in the stadium and on the field.  Everyone else at home is like, wow, cool, we get to watch the Super Bowl in the snow.  How cool is it to watch football in the snow when it's snowing?  The Pats-Oakland game years ago was a great game because it was just snowing like crazy.  It was great.  You didn't even know where they were on the field.  They couldn't get the snow off the field fast enough.  You could barely see them playing because the cameras. 
[00:10:30]  Those are the greatest games.  It's fantastic.  And on a Sunday, if you're flipping around, the 4 o'clock game is some who-gives-a-shit game, but it's snowing.  You're stopping and watching, right?  You're going to watch.  I think it's a great move by the NFL.  It's a great move because this area needs money.  For some reason, we're broke.  I don't really understand why.  Money to fucking put in someone else's pocket.  Really?  It doesn't help the economy?  It's such bullshit.  This fucking bullshit area. 
[00:11:00]  I won't even say state or city or anything because it's the area.  But it's just, yeah, okay, they'll make, well, we're projecting hundreds of millions of dollars in influx and cash in our area.  And then they'll be crying a week later that they've got to raise taxes on fucking tampons or something.  And then get rid of something.  And then get rid of 20 bus routes and 18 subway lines.  Because the city's broke.  What happened?  We had the Super Bowl.  Yes, but we had quite a deficit. 
[00:11:30]  You know, you go to these other cities.  They've got brand new subway systems.  It's all digital, electronic.  There's no bums.  There's no urine smell.  There's no graffiti.  Yeah.  You could tell the trains are brand new.  And here.  We're building the 1800s.  And here it's shit.  Yeah.  Below the ground.  And they say they're broke.  We should have all brand new stuff in New York.  Wow.  The Giants have played at the Polo Grounds from 1925 to 1955. 
[00:12:00]  Where is the Polo Grounds?  Oh, that's gone.  I know.  Where were they?  Wasn't that in Brooklyn?  Was it Brooklyn?  Was it Brooklyn?  Upper Manhattan.  I don't know.  Was it Brooklyn, Upper Manhattan?  That's impossible.  Brooklyn, Upper Manhattan.  Was it Manhattan?  What?  Yeah, it was way uptown.  It's 155th and 8th Avenue.  Did you say Brooklyn?  Oh, I thought I heard Don Marr say Brooklyn.  So I said Brooklyn.  All right.  And then Yankee Stadium.  Oh, that's right.  Remember? 
[00:12:30]  I was a little boy, and the Giants played at Yankee Stadium.  I forgot about that.  56 to 73?  Yeah, they played there for 17 years, and then they moved on to the Yale Bowl.  Where the hell is that?  They did that for a year.  The Yale Bowl.  Wouldn't that be up in Connecticut?  They played in Connecticut.  They played in Connecticut?  They've just been fucking hobos.  Yes.  No.  Hobos.  Wow, minutes. 
[00:13:00]  They played up in Connecticut for one year, one season.  Then they moved to Shea Stadium, where the Jets played for many years, for a year.  And then finally, Giant Stadium opened up.  Oh, no.  Yeah, okay.  Giant Stadium opened up in 1976, and that lasted, what, 33 years?  And then they got a brand-new stadium over there.  Middle East Stadium.  A grand opening there with none other than Jersey's own Bon Jovi.  Well, that's tonight, Anthony.  Yes.  You got your Bon Jovi tickets?  Oh, do I never.  Those guys are fans of the show. 
[00:13:30]  You remember.  I know.  I have no problem with Bon Jovi.  I don't know if they're still fans, but...  Not, you know, listening to Bon Jovi's music.  Have you ever been to a Bon Jovi concert?  I can say no.  It's pretty fucking good.  I don't go out of my way to listen to Bon Jovi music, but...  It's a Radisson, so it's pretty good.  I found myself at a Bon Jovi show a couple times, and you know what?  Yeah?  Yeah.  You found yourself there?  You're just all of a sudden, what am I doing?  Hey, Bon Jovi's playing.  Well, it wasn't like I stayed out all night to get my tickets. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, no?  You didn't camp out?  No.  Somehow I acquired a ticket.  I don't remember.  I think one year it was because the radio station was sponsoring it.  Hey!  First time I saw Bon Jovi was in Rochester, New York.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, back in the Slippery When Wet days?  Late 80s, whenever that is.  Yeah?  Whatever album that was.  You might have missed Slippery When Wet.  It was Skid Row and Bon Jovi, where the minor league baseball team plays up there in Rochester. 
[00:14:30]  And then I think I saw them at Giants Stadium once, or up in Boston.  I don't remember.  It's all blurry.  But they're opening the stadium tonight?  Yes, Bon Jovi.  Playing, I guess, a couple of shows there to kick it off.  You know?  It's Jersey.  Jersey guy.  It's Florentine.  That's how Florentine.  Yeah, Florentine.  Me and Anthony were talking about Florentine just before the show.  Yesterday was fantastic.  He could take a molestation like nobody else. 
[00:15:00]  It's amazing.  Him talking about that guy trying to touch him for wrestling pictures yesterday.  Touch him.  Kissed him on the cheek.  It was just fantastic.  Hand down his pants.  But he justified the whole thing because he was getting great wrestling pictures.  And the best thing about him is, as he's telling the story, he's just as excited now about those pictures as he was then.  He's like, no, they were pictures.  Or the seats.  Andre the Giant was walking by.  I saw him.  Front row.  Front row.  The Giant. 
[00:15:30]  It's like, you were being molested.  Yeah, what about your wee-wee being touched?  Yeah, he touched your pee-pee.  I got 35 pictures.  My favorite gym moment was when he goes, she goes, Curtis?  I go, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Florentine told him.  There's only so many people that could think that quickly on their feet.  Just like, most people go, no, I'm sorry.  You got the wrong verse.  And he's just thinking, yeah.  Yeah.  I guess you had to be listening yesterday.  I had to be laughing.  Hopefully you were listening yesterday because Florentine just fucking killed for us yesterday. 
[00:16:00]  Eddie in St. Louis.  I'm nominating that, by the way.  I'm nominating that for the number one bit of the week to be played.  Oh, are they even doing that because it's Memorial Day weekend?  Is there special programming?  I don't know.  They're doing it on a Friday.  They're doing it on Friday?  They're doing it on Friday.  Oh, okay.  I am nominating that as bit of the week.  Number one?  Number one, Florentine telling the whole story about the fat guy that put his hand down Florentine's pants when he was 14. 
[00:16:30]  That is, see?  I'm involved.  Wait, have we done any other good radio this week?  I don't give a shit.  I don't even remember.  I don't either.  All right, let's nominate that because it was yesterday.  I would have to agree with you there, sir.  Let's go to Eddie in St. Louis.  Eddie.  How you doing, guys?  Hey, Eddie.  I guess it's kind of nice for the fans who enjoy the good weather, but the thing that you lose,  and especially going to see football in St. Louis with these pussies playing a dome, 
[00:17:00]  football is an outdoor sport, and it's not just about the guys versus each other, but man against the elements.  I mean, I want to see that Super Bowl like a fucking frozen mud bomb went off, you know?  You're going to have such wonderful images from that.  It's going to be a great game, I think.  But it's way too far away to get excited over.  Oh, I know.  It's three Super Bowls away, right?  Well, do you know how this works, though?  No, I guess not.  One, two, three, four away.  Do you know how this works, though?  We'll be fucking, God willing, God willing, we'll all be fucking sitting somewhere going, 
[00:17:30]  wow, remember when they announced that?  And you'll be going, Anthony, Anthony, it'll be open.  Here's something going to make you feel old.  Super Bowl coming up, Giants Stadium next week.  They announced that four years ago.  And I'll be like, holy shit, that sounded like yesterday.  You mean like...  Because that's shit that just happens.  It will go by so quickly.  You mean like...  Death is just waiting for you. 
[00:18:00]  You mean like this one?  Michael Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley?  Remember that?  Seems like yesterday, right?  Tell me it's 20 years.  16 years ago.  Sorry, it's 16 fucking years ago.  Seems like yesterday.  Jesus Christ.  Eddie, Travis, and a bunch of us were talking about how the football season, as you get  later and later in the year, you know, the games are sloppier, meaning the conditions.  You got mud, you got rain, you got snow.  And then the Super Bowl hits, and it's in a beautiful climate.  It doesn't feel connected to the season anymore. 
[00:18:30]  So in a way, I think this is going to be kind of cool.  People are tailgating with wife beaters on.  Yeah.  It's all colorful, like bright.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Vivid colors.  Yep.  No, you want gray.  And the week before, it's like some fucking blizzard in Green Bay or something you're  watching.  It's going to be really good, but the biggest thing the NFL can do to probably help the  schedule out is, I know they're talking about tacking extra games on there, but they  need to get rid of that fucking preseason football.  Nobody gives two shits about that. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, I agree.  They're talking more and more about getting rid of that and just making it an 18-game season,  right?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't really see the point that it's going to make.  I mean, you're probably going to have these big issues with the players' unions and everybody's  going to want a lot more money.  And I mean, there is more commercials to sell and stuff, but is it really going to make a  big difference?  Commercials are going to be great for that one, too.  There's going to be one for flying car.  That's right.  Four years from now, sure.  And there's going to be a little public service announcement for the city about their moving 
[00:19:30]  sidewalks.  Sure, that's right.  And jetpacks.  Well, let's talk about the big issue.  Who's going to do the halftime show?  I mean, I hope it's not going to be Jay-Z.  I mean, let's get something to do.  Jay-Z might not even be popular in four years.  Who knows?  It's probably somebody that isn't even popular yet.  Really?  It's some kind of...  It's not going to be Lady Gaga.  There's a zygote somewhere that's going to be the halftime show four years from now.  Some fucking little douche is playing guitar in a garage right now.  Right.  That's going to be the halftime show.  Not knowing he's going to be the halftime fucking show. 
[00:20:00]  Either that or Tom Petty.  Yeah, one or the other.  Right.  Tom Petty.  Stupid Tom Petty.  And I was a fan growing up, but what was that about?  Justin Bieber will be on his third Dewey.  Yeah.  Fucking...  Enough with Bieber.  Justin Bieber.  Enough with fucking Bieber.  Jay Moore was mad at Justin Bieber's haircut on his Twitter last night.  Well, I don't blame him.  He was saying, show your forehead, you little fuck.  He was getting annoyed with the little Justin Bieber.  Well, that's the look, though.  You know, the sweeping bangs across the fucking... 
[00:20:30]  You got to have the swooping, yeah, bangs in front of your forehead.  Yeah.  That's what young guys do to have baldness, is they comb forward the emo look.  Do you think Justin Bieber is doing a comb-over?  No, but he's 14 or something.  14 years old.  Whatever he is.  He's got male pattern baldness.  I don't know.  Young guys...  How great would that be?  Young guys with receding hairlines do that.  I've caught so many guys doing that, like emo guys or whatever.  You see them, and when you look at their hair a little bit, you're like, wow, he's covering up.  All right.  I've been known to push it a little forward myself. 
[00:21:00]  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  You're not 17.  You're playing it forward?  I'm pushing it a little forward.  Not pay it forward.  Pay it forward.  Say, it's a play on words.  It's a play on an effect.  Eddie, too early to talk about Super Bowl of 2014, I'm thinking.  There's just excitement in this area because New York, New Jersey got it.  Yeah, and I was surprised they got it, but I'm glad they did.  I don't think anyone was surprised.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it seemed like it was pretty obvious they were just going to give it to New Jersey 
[00:21:30]  and try something different.  Well, the Jets and Giants both were able to combine their bid.  Yeah, and you got that brand new stadium, which will be a bit old.  It won't be state-of-the-art anymore four years from now.  Oh, my God.  It's going to be old because new stadiums are going to be in the clouds.  They're going to be floating like Cloud City.  Are they?  Yes.  Nice.  Kind of like an avatar?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  You haven't seen that yet.  No, not yet.  I'm waiting.  Where the mountains and the waterfalls are kind of floating.  Yeah, floating.  And you'll take your flying car up and you'll land and your flying car just turns into a 
[00:22:00]  suitcase and you go and see the game.  Nice.  Dude, it's all the way in 2014.  All the way in 2014.  You know what we thought about 2014 years ago?  It was going to be amazing and I still think it's going to.  And according to Back to the Future, there's a lot of things happening in 2015.  Like what?  Well, everything.  All the future stuff.  Inflatable shoes and jackets that self-dry. 
[00:22:30]  Hoverboards.  Are you as angry as I am?  Sorry.  There's a Justin Bieber fucking video that went viral because he banged his head.  He bumped his head.  I hate his friends more than I hate him.  But it was on his manager's cock.  Why do you hate his friends?  Those are his friends?  The guy sitting in front.  It's like a pubescent entourage.  Yeah.  So he's banged his head.  What is he doing?  That sounded like him.  His buddy is having a convulsion.  Did he really get hurt?  Could only hope that was the front of a train. 
[00:23:00]  That would have been even better.  What?  Justin Bieber's little hairy head explode.  All right.  All right, Eddie.  Anything else about sports?  You like your sports.  That Lakers series looks like it's taking an interesting turn.  Don't really know how much you guys are into that.  There's really no hockey to talk about at this point.  No, it's going to be Lakers fucking Celtics.  We all know that.  I know you guys don't give two shits about soccer, but the USA played their first tune-up  match, I guess.  Soccer!  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  Now they got their ass handed to them. 
[00:23:30]  Name one USA soccer player.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Pele.  Do it.  Pele.  Landon Donovan.  Who?  He's the captain of the L.A. Galaxy.  Pele's still playing?  I'm going back a little.  No, no, no.  I'll go right.  I actually answered you.  Pele.  Yeah, you're answering me.  I'll go with Beckham.  Some fucking 70-year-old guy trying to kick a fucking ball.  The problem with Beckham is that piece of shit almost destroyed Major League Soccer in  the United States.  Although, speaking of New York, there's a guy, his name is Therion Rhee. 
[00:24:00]  He was playing at Barcelona.  He's coming to New York now.  They're talking about getting another team.  You're still talking about soccer.  Why are you talking soccer?  No one cares about soccer.  Little kids play soccer.  Adults don't give a shit about it.  I'll agree with that.  No one cares.  That's why it never takes off here.  They try to introduce it every few years.  I don't really.  I never understood soccer.  I mean, we've done this a million times, but any sport where they could go to commercial 
[00:24:30]  while the game's still playing and you don't miss anything?  Yeah.  What good is that?  I'm surprised rugby hasn't taken off in the U.S.  Yeah, rugby.  That's another thing.  Rugby!  You know what?  We got football.  Thank you, Anthony.  And not football.  Football.  I'd rather see Australian rules football before I see rugby.  That shit is fucking off the hook.  How about cricket?  Cricket?  Cricket!  Do you even understand the rules? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, we did that bit, too.  I know.  We don't understand the rules of cricket.  They put their stupid white clothes on.  Didn't fucking Jim Jeffries try to explain cricket to us?  Cricket's a great game.  I mean, you know.  Why is it great?  They look like Jamaican waders.  We wouldn't have baseball without cricket.  What?  No, come on.  You think Abner Doubleday couldn't figure it out?  He took cricket and made it easy for everyone to explain.  Yeah.  Everyone to understand.  It's not that hard.  There's wickets and you score runs.  But anyway, you know, we perfect.  What the hell is a wicket? 
[00:25:30]  I'm not even going to get into it.  The wicket's stupid.  The fucking way they play.  We went through the rules once.  I've forgotten them already.  Thank God.  And can't you be at bat for like 10 straight days or something?  At least.  Yeah.  At least.  Really?  Stupid rugby with the...  Is that Australia rules?  Oh, fuck.  Go to Australia rules football.  They are badass.  I'll give them that.  They don't use pads, man.  They're hardcore.  They're out there just getting hit.  How many people die or are paralyzed playing this game? 
[00:26:00]  It's got to be ridiculous.  Are you talking about a thrilling rule?  Nobody.  People barely get hurt.  There's no concussions.  If you look at that...  How they're hitting their heads together.  Yeah.  No, seriously.  I mean, if you look at that versus the NFL, these motherfuckers use that helmet as a weapon.  And then they got the shoulders.  They drop down.  I mean, most of them...  I just saw a hit that I don't give a flying fuck.  These guys hit each other at full speed.  And that guy goes down.  He got an elbow right to the face.  And guess what?  If he had pads, I don't think he'd be on the ground fucking crying for his mom right now.  Wow. 
[00:26:30]  They launched that guy.  Yeah.  Australian rules football.  You should check it out sometime.  These are highlight clips, though.  Yeah, but...  They actually threw him up in the air to catch that.  Just to get the ball.  It's like a cheerleading exhibition.  Why do that?  It's going to come down.  And then you run and you could kick it.  All of a sudden, you could just kick the ball into the fucking uprights.  Whatever the fuck they're called.  Hooligans.  Yeah.  Rugby hooligans.  All right, Eddie.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Trash Master.  Trash Master. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, morning.  Love you.  Love the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The stadium's supposed to have a...  like one of those portable domes on it come 2014.  Very similar to the one they just built on the new soccer stadium down in Harrison.  But no one's talking about a dome.  I haven't heard about this.  Everyone's talking about the Super Bowl in 2014 or saying, you know...  What are you, dome guy?  First Super Bowl in a while played in cold weather.  Nah, it's going to be domed. 
[00:27:30]  I have not heard one word about this.  Not a one there, Trash Master.  Everyone here is thinking, you're a liar.  All right.  Well, we'll see.  We'll see.  Who's your source?  Who's your source?  I have a very good friend of mine who works for Lenmark.  Also in talks with the new owners of the Xanadu project.  That just is getting...  You do realize your name is Trash Master.  Yes.  How do you have friends in high places? 
[00:28:00]  If you were Dome Master, we would be like, all right, now I understand.  No, no, no.  Trash Master because I'm in the...  I care.  Like I care.  Sanitation.  Like I care.  Like I care.  Like I care.  Like I care.  You don't like this guy's dome theory?  No!  All right.  We'll have to wait and see.  Yep.  All right.  Yeah, the guys...  And I hear it's coming from Ted's Dome Emporium.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  It'll be ready by 2015, but it's made out of rolling papers.  It doesn't snow in February, by the way, so I don't think we'll have snow for that fucking thing.  Let's say hi to James in Jersey.  James.  Hey, morning, fellas.  Hey.  The game in New York is a horrible idea.  Nobody...  I mean, it's going to be cool to talk about, hey, remember the 2014 Mud Ice Bowl in like 50 years from now.  But when you're sitting at home watching that, you're going to say, this fucking sucks.  Just like the last couple of years, you got the Arizona-Pittsburgh game, the game... 
[00:29:00]  I mean, that's exciting, and that's not going to happen if it's four degrees outside.  Oh, my God.  It's way more exciting to see these guys play in horrible weather.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  I don't mind it once in a while, but I think for...  I just think the average temperature of 25 degrees out that time of year, it's going to take away from it.  Pussy.  Yeah.  You're ruining our fun, man.  I mean, nothing better than the maintenance guy getting on the tiny little tractor to try to, like...  Oh, to make a little swath that they can kick. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  I love when they have to make the swath.  While the team's down at this end of the field, they're trying to get this side of the field ready.  Ah, just a wreck.  I fucking love all that.  And all the people complaining...  There's people complaining about it.  We're like, most of us aren't going.  The average...  I don't care if you live 10 miles from the stadium.  It's a corporate event, obviously.  You'd go.  I love how this guy's saying most people don't go to the Super Bowl.  So you're saying the Super Bowl, the seats would be empty.  Yeah.  Full of snow.  And they'd be playing in front of nobody. 
[00:30:00]  It's the Super Bowl.  It is a corporate event.  If somebody was going to hand me tickets, I'm not going to...  Dude.  I would probably go, but I'm just saying, if you're a client of somebody, you think you're  going to take your kid out in five-degree weather?  Yes.  You know what?  That's why I love this.  All those corporate douches have to sit in a very fucking cold seat and watch the Super  Bowl.  How great is that?  Dude, regular season games are sold out in the winter.  Right.  A Super Bowl is going to be sold out in the cold.  Of course it's going to be sold out. 
[00:30:30]  Of course.  Of course.  And so I just think it's going to take away from the game.  No need for that kind of language.  Language.  All right.  My young son in the car.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There's the big news that pretty much went nowhere on our show today.  No one cares.  Well, it was a big announcement yesterday, you know.  It was the lead story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were really pumping that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I Twittered something last night about, you know, the threat of terrorism and everybody 
[00:31:00]  called me a negative Nelly.  Oh, and I'm just thinking that it's and they say, you know, there's been Super Bowls before  Anthony and there hasn't been terrorism.  It's like, but you don't understand this area is a fucking terrorist magnet.  They look for big events and big things in New York and Jersey, whatever the fuck, because  New York Giants, it's a New York event.  Shut up, Jersey.  And, you know, that to me would be like something they could go, all right, we know when it is. 
[00:31:30]  We got some years to plan something.  So let's get cracking there, Al Qaeda.  But how are they going to do it?  I don't know.  If we can figure it out, then we figure it out.  But it's very hard to bomb a sporting event.  If you go in there with a, you know, nicely dressed with a fucking explosive belt on with  a few people strategically planted around the stadium, you know, the horror, you would 
[00:32:00]  wreak havoc.  But security for the Super Bowl is pretty tight.  Well, a fucking metal detector ain't going to catch C4.  I think they patch it down and all sorts of shit.  I think you have to be at the stadium like eight hours early or something.  What?  They're going to pat down 85,000 people?  Yeah, pretty much.  I don't think so.  I've been through some of the pat downs.  Yeah.  And, you know, when you go to the games and if you're walking in with nothing, they don't  even pat you down.  Right.  If you've got a heavy coat on and a bag, they'll do shit to you. 
[00:32:30]  You know what?  With a cold climate Super Bowl, it makes it a little harder because people will have their  coats on.  You'll have your big coat.  I mean, if you're in Miami or San Diego, you're in short sleeves.  What are you hiding?  Short sleeves, shorts.  You know what?  I'm with you now.  I think you make a good point.  Now you got a fucking exploding North Face jacket.  It's just a little look.  People are talking to me like this shit doesn't happen.  I'm saying it's this area is a magnet for terrorists.  Are you a little worried about a terrorist attack? 
[00:33:00]  I'm not going to the game, so I don't care.  Wasn't there some kind of Super Bowl movie that-  Black Sunday.  Black Sunday.  Oh, the blimp and the bomb and the thing.  So maybe it's a blimp scenario.  A blimp bomb?  Yeah, a blimp bomb.  Who saw that coming?  No, Bruce Dern.  Yeah, I don't know.  Jersey's got to be feeling like the just retarded little brother in this whole thing, though.  Because New York, I mean, Bloomberg got out there and was like, 
[00:33:30]  And we are making, what Super Bowl is it?  Super Bowl what?  X-X-L-Z-Y-X-I-I.  48?  Something like that.  Something like that?  Yeah.  Just waiting for an answer.  49?  Yeah, Super Bowl 49.  It was like, and we are turning 49th Street into Super Bowl way.  And they pull the thing off and it says Super Bowl way.  Oh.  With 20,000 other signs that say other things. 
[00:34:00]  Some of these street signs-  Is there anything more annoying?  It's terrible.  When you're trying to figure out where you are and instead of going with the number system,  it says Vince Lombardi fucking roadway or something.  I'm like, what does that mean?  Where am I?  And it's not even special anymore.  Like when they did like Frank Sinatra way or something, it was big because it was one sign on a street.  W.C. Handy.  What the fuck was that? 
[00:34:30]  Wait, this is a shot I took a few weeks ago.  West 52nd Street.  It's at, oh my God, there's 20 signs there too.  It's 52nd and 6th, but the other street signs read W.C. Handy's Place.  And W.C.B.S. FM Way, which is also Cousin Brucey Way.  Cousin Brucey Way and also Avenue of the Americas, which is 6th Avenue.  That fucking light pole is covered with signs.  It looks like that thing in front of the swamp at MASH. 
[00:35:00]  And nobody says, I'm going to be on Cousin Brucey Way.  I'll see you there soon.  Maybe on Cousin Brucey Way.  Yeah, that was my little caption for the picture.  How do you mail a letter?  How do you do that?  Do you use the W.C. Handy?  Do you think your letter would get there?  Do you just write Cousin Brucey Way?  It's like, I'm going to Cousin Brucey Way.  Can I please?  Yeah, taxi.  Take me to Cousin Brucey Way.  What the fuck are you talking about? 
[00:35:30]  People with AIDS Plaza.  That is not real.  That is real.  Oh, boy.  People with AIDS Plaza?  Where is that?  I'm going to go there.  I'm going to avoid it.  I can't remember.  Yeah, it's downtown near City Hall.  Wait, this isn't fake?  No, no, it's totally real.  Oh, my.  Yeah, I'm going to be down at People with AIDS Plaza.  Bring in razor blades.  Who the fuck would join you?  I'm going down there.  Huh?  It's a lonely place.  People just walking their dogs in robes. 
[00:36:00]  Sipping broth slowly and vomiting.  And I'm going to ask you for Magic's autograph.  I would have bet a lot of money that was a goof sign.  That's real.  People with AIDS Plaza.  Yeah, I'll be at People with AIDS Plaza right there on Sarcoma Boulevard.  So just look me up.  Do we really need fucking to be reminded with street signs?  No, what the fuck?  Hey, look, I live on, I live on, they found a lump drive.  Quote, quote, unquote, pneumonia Avenue. 
[00:36:30]  Turn left on mesothelioma Avenue.  Worked that in two days in a row.  Jesus.  Yes.  Well, it works, though.  Certainly works.  Where were we?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the Mayor Bloomberg.  125th Street is now known as Sickle Cell Plaza.  Thank you, Steve, from Bakeshore.  Who else would have come up with that one?  You have to go up instead of the West Side Highway, the drunk driving victim highway. 
[00:37:00]  Yes, of course.  Sickle Cell Plaza.  Sickle Cell Plaza.  That's funny.  So the mayor was out there on Super Bowl way or whatever the fuck and announcing the  Super Bowl thing yesterday.  Yeah, announcing it.  And meanwhile, like I said, Jersey's got to just feel like shit.  They, this is like a New York event.  New York is celebrating. 
[00:37:30]  Well, now they're arguing.  New York and New Jersey are arguing.  But they've been arguing for years.  Because New Jersey has a good claim that it's in New Jersey.  And New York always wins this argument.  But New Jersey should say, no, you can't call them the Giants and play here then.  And New Jersey should fucking shut their faces and for years go, no, you're not playing  here and calling yourselves the New York Giants.  You're not doing it.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  They don't think much of Jersey if they can't get the name changed to the New Jersey Giants.  But they just, they should say no before.  Right.  Right.  They were just looking for, you know, they're looking for revenue. 
[00:38:00]  It should be the New Jersey Giants and the New York Jets, right?  Yeah.  Jersey, basically the sixth borough.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Man, they just got this shitty under the stick jersey.  They really do.  All right.  What is it?  Five, six miles from New York?  I understand that.  It's just bad that you have to be so close to the pinnacle.  It's a hard five or six miles though, Jimmy.  The fucking giant mecca, the center of the free world's universe. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  New York City.  And then, ah, you're the kid next door.  Yeah.  You're the kid next door that comes over to play because we got all the good toys.  That's true.  But Jimmy goes, it's only six miles.  I mean, you got a tunnel to deal with where one fucking guy breaks down, the whole city  stops for eight hours.  We got Coca-Cola, you got RC in your fridge.  Oh.  That's how Jersey is.  You got no frills, cookies, we got Entenmann's.  Entenmann's cookies.  I like Entenmann's.  Chocolate chip ones?  Yeah.  All right, those are all right.  They are good.  A guy who doesn't know how to give examples. 
[00:39:00]  You got Bill's tires and we got Firestones.  Right.  Yeah, that makes sense.  No one's ever heard of Bill's tires.  Everyone's had no-fill cookies.  You've been to Jersey and gone to Bill's tires?  It's fantastic.  Hey, have you guys figured out Lost yet?  No idea.  Yeah.  You have?  Looks like my theory was wrong.  Looks like Jimmy Norton is a dolt.  Why?  It annoys me that people fell out of the tail of the plane and lived.  Yeah, yeah, but they were meant to. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, and I understand.  That's like some kind of divine intervention.  Who the fuck knows?  It's still stupid.  But that end scene, ABC had to actually put out a statement because everybody was speculating,  as were we on this very program, that the end scene, that very somber kind of only hearing the wind and the waves as they're showing the wreckage of the plane on the beach after Jack closes his eye and dies,  that just seemed that ABC threw that in there. 
[00:40:00]  The writers, producers didn't put that in there.  ABC put that in there as what they called a buffer between Jack dying and the news so that people could decompress and kind of let it soak in for a few minutes.  It's almost like, remember those episodes of All in the Family or Good Times when something bad would happen and it would end like, oh.  And then there wasn't the da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  They would just roll the credits. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  And it would be very quiet.  It would be silent and the credits would just be rolling.  You'd be like, ah, the images shown during the end of the credits and credits of Lost, which included shots of Oceanic Gate 15 on a deserted beach, were not part of the episode, but were a visual aid to allow the viewers to decompress before heading into the news.  But it was part of Lost.  I'm confused.  What do you mean it wasn't part of Lost?  It was just part of the end of Lost.  It might as well have been anything.  It could have been a black screen of just credits. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  Well, who made that?  ABC made that decision.  ABC.  ABC.  ABC as the entity.  Not the people that put Lost together.  No, not the.  Because Lost is on ABC, so I would say it's all the same.  No, they tacked it on there.  So ABC chose to.  And I guess the producers of Lost and the people of Lost were like, look, we made this show to end the way we wanted it to end with Jack closing his eye and dying. 
[00:41:30]  And now people are speculating on the end that we didn't put on there.  So they made an announcement saying, no, that wasn't part of the program.  That was just a thing that was still confusing to the average person, though.  Well, if you're watching Lost and then there's some kind of lost.  Yeah.  I've read a lot of things now so far and had time to ponder it.  And I think I completely understand what the fuck was going on.  You listen to Jack's father, Christian, and you got the whole thing pretty much right there wrapped up.  Take it literally what he's saying.  Take everything Christian's saying very literally. 
[00:42:00]  And that's the end of the fucking show.  And it makes complete sense.  It's annoying.  Is it annoying?  I still love the show.  But that's the fucking tail of the plane fell from 30,000 feet.  Yeah, but it was all meant to happen.  I know.  I could live with it.  They could have.  Come on, guys.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  But it is a TV show.  You can do that type of thing.  Wasn't there a lot of weird things that don't make sense?  You can.  And I did like the last episode a lot.  I thought it was great. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  But it was like there are certain things I felt like they were just trying.  Not that they had always intended to end that way.  But like, okay, we have to end this.  All right, that sounds plausible.  Like the numbers being the numbers next to the name on the inside of a cave, I thought was a horrendous extension.  Yeah, you didn't like that one?  Terrible.  But, you know, other stuff I thought was very good.  How the ship got there.  I liked that a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a lot of exciting.  I thought it was great.  The numbers I thought was terrible.  I have no real giant problems with the show. 
[00:43:00]  I thought the entire run was very entertaining.  Yes.  And apparently a lot of other people did too because a lot of people watched it.  There you go.  Yeah, it did very well in the ratings.  Danny, what's this Lost thing?  Unexplained storylines from Lost?  Yeah, this was kind of going around yesterday a lot.  But it's basically someone took all of the unexplained questions and just kind of put them strung up next to each other one by one. 
[00:43:30]  And the thing goes on for quite some time.  So there's a lot of angles that weren't quite covered.  Really?  Okay.  Why did they do that?  Sopranos did that, obviously.  We always go back to the Sopranos.  What are all the storylines that just explain to the shit?  Because Sopranos will be known, will go down in history as one of the, well, worst endings, I think.  Even though if you think about it, it inspired a lot of conversation and stuff.  But that's going to be one of those things where it's like any season or series finale, you're going to go, well, when the Sopranos did this. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, I guess.  I understand why.  It's like the St. Pat's thing.  It's always going to be mentioned.  Yeah, I guess.  Lost will have loose ends.  There's a million storylines tied.  I can almost understand Lost not tying everything.  Well, that's frustrating as a fan, isn't it?  But the Sopranos, but a bunch of mafia guys, how do you not tie that up?  Right.  There's a lot of mysterious things on Lost, so if things don't get solved, well, fuck yourself.  It's mysterious.  What are some of the ones, Travis, that can get tied up?  Do you know?  Well, here we go.  I really liked Lost. 
[00:44:30]  I guess I just still have a few questions about it.  Like, why did the monster kill the pilot?  What did Loxy when he first saw the smoke?  What's with the polar bear in Walt's comic?  Where is Christian Shepard's body if it's not in the casket?  Why did the psychics say that Claire had to fly on Oceanic Flight 815, and why did he  insist that her son had to be raised by Claire?  Why did the others want Walt so badly?  Who sent Kate the letter telling her about her mother being treated for cancer in the  hospital?  How does Walt know about the hatch, and why does he warn Locke not to open it?  Why does the smoke monster make mechanical sounds?  How is Walt able to apparate before Shannon?  How did Walt communicate with Michael using the Swan computer? 
[00:45:00]  What is the deal with Kate and that horse?  Why are supplies still being dropped on the island after the purge, and by who?  What triggered the lockdown, and why on earth would anyone design it so during the lockdown  black lights go on?  What happened to the original Henry Gale?  What happened to the original timeline, Libby, between the mental hospital and getting on  the tail section of Flight 815?  Who built the four-toed statue?  Why does only one specific bearing get you off the island?  What are the hieroglyphics on the Swan countdown timer about?  Why did Tom feel the need to wear a fake beard?  Who was Libby's previous husband who gave her a boat that gave to Desmond?  Who were the skeletons in the polar bear kit?  Where did the toy truck come from?  How did Locke and Echo escape the hatch explosion? 
[00:45:30]  Why couldn't Locke talk after the hatch explosion?  Why did the monster kill Mr. Echo, and why didn't he just do it the first time they met?  What did Mr. Echo mean when he said, you're next, after he dies?  How disgusting was it when Hurley was eating from that tub of ranch dressing?  Why did Yummy's body disappear?  Why does Danny say Jack wasn't on Jacob's list when, in fact, his name was clearly written  in the cave?  Why can't women on the island have babies, and what does this have to do with anything?  What was that Russian letter in McHale's typewriter?  Why is the supply drop menu hidden behind a game of computer chess?  I mean, computer chess?  Remember when Ben gave Juliet that weird mark as a punishment? 
[00:46:00]  What was that about?  And what's the deal with Jack's tattoos?  Actually, you know what?  I don't care about that one.  Desmond knew a monk?  How did that monk know Eloise?  Why did Ben see his dead mother?  Who decided it was time to kill the others in a purge?  What happened to Ben's childhood friend, Annie?  Why did Desmond have a false vision of Claire and Aaron leaving the island on a helicopter?  How does McHale keep coming back to life?  Why does Walt tell Locke that he still has work to do?  Who's I appeared in the cabin window?  We know it wasn't the smoke monster, because it was Christian Shepard.  Now we know that Christian Shepard was the smoke monster the whole time.  Where did Miles get that picture of Ben?  Who is the RG on Naomi's bracelet?  Why was there a 31 minute, 20 second difference between the timers? 
[00:46:30]  Who is the economist, and why did Ben want him dead?  Why was Ben so surprised that they could kill Alex?  I mean, what are the rules?  If the smoke monster can't leave the island, and was zombie Jack's dad,  how does Jack's dad appear at a hospital in L.A.?  And on a freighter.  How did the monster get into Jacob's cabin?  And why ask Locke not to tell anyone that he saw Claire in the cabin?  Why did Ghost Horace direct Locke to the cabin and tell him Jacob was waiting there,  when it was really the smoke monster?  Why do the Oceanic Six name Charlie, Boone, and Libby as the other three survivors?  I mean, what's the logic in that?  Why does Miles decide to stay on the island?  What is the deal with the frozen wheel?  I mean, it combines light and water? 
[00:47:00]  That's not really an answer.  Why does Ben insist that the Oceanic Six, as well as Locke, have to return to the island?  Why don't the rules of time travel apply to Desmond?  Who were the men who tried to capture Said and Hurley,  but got thrown into a dishwasher full of knives in one of the sweetest lost fight scenes of all time?  Ben asked his butcher friend, who was watching Locke's body,  if Gabriel and Jeffrey hadn't checked in yet?  Who are any of these people?  What was Ben hiding when he took something out of the vet and put it in his bag?  When the gang was, like, unsuck in time,  who was that shooting at them from the outrigger?  Who sent Son a gun and pictures of Jack and Ben?  Who attacked Said at the hospital, and why did he have Kate's address?  Why was the smoke monster at the temple? 
[00:47:30]  When did the temple become, like, an anti-smoke monster fortress?  How did the producers of the hit TV show Exposé deal with the death of their two lead actors?  How did Eloise come to run the land?  How does a pendulum predict the island's movements?  I mean, who figured that out?  Why do those returning to the island need to recreate the circumstances of their first arrival?  How did Jack, Hurley, and Kate get from that Ajira flake to the 70s, and why didn't Son?  How did Richard bypass the sonar fence?  How did Ethan go from the Dharma initiative to a member of the others?  What's with all the hieroglyphics underneath the temple?  Why did Widmore tell Ben to kill Rousseau and her baby,  and why did he then let Ben keep the baby anyway? 
[00:48:00]  Why did Daniel leave the island in the 70s,  and why does he tell Jack he doesn't belong there?  Why does Richard think he saw everyone in the 1977 Dharma picture die?  Who broke the circle of ash around Jacob's cabin?  Why can Jacob leave the island, but the smoke monster can't?  Jacob uses his last breath to say,  They are coming, but who are they?  What's the deal with the pool that brings people back to life,  and why did it bring Saeed back with an English accent?  What is the infection?  How did Claire get infected?  How did Saeed get infected?  And why did he need to voluntarily take a poison pill,  especially when he could become uninfected with a simple argument for love?  Why was the smoke monster slash Locke slash whoever it is confused that Sawyer could see young Jacob? 
[00:48:30]  What's the magic lighthouse about?  How was Dogen simply being alive, keeping the smoke monster out of the lighthouse?  What happened to the flight attendant Cindy, and the kids?  Why didn't Sun tell Jyn to go, just so their daughter wouldn't be an orphan?  Where did Jacob and the smoke monster's mother come from?  Where did Jacob and the smoke monster's other mother come from?  Who finished the magic wheel that combines, quote, light and water?  And when did it become frozen?  What is the nature of the light?  And magic wine?  I mean, seriously, magic wine?  Why does that Tina Fey lady want the electromagnetic map of the island?  How did Woodmore's electromagnetic thingy send Desmond to the afterlife and back? 
[00:49:00]  Wasn't Saeed's soulmate Nadia?  Why weren't Michael, Walt, Lapidus, Echo, or any of the other characters at the church?  Jesus.  That is true.  That's a lot of whys.  Saeed and Nadia.  That was supposed to be the one.  Yeah.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Yeah.  That was a lot of shit that was not tied up, I guess.  I didn't like the fact that if that alternate reality was a place that they created, it's  like, why does Claire have the baby there? 
[00:49:30]  It's like she's standing there with an infant in the church.  Well, they were all the way they remember.  No, no, I understand that.  But it was like, Jesus, come on.  It's cheese dick stuff.  You want them to be all old?  No, but that to me said that they should have all died together.  That's the way they were when they died.  So stupid.  No, it's got to be the way they were when they were all together.  But they don't tell us when they separated.  Well, yeah, they do.  When did Claire leave?  How do you know how long Claire hung out with fucking Lapidus for?  It's just they lived their lives.  We didn't have to look in on anything that happened after that because we knew they just 
[00:50:00]  lived their lives and eventually died.  Them being dead is so much better and more palatable than that asshole took off.  He backed up like it's a fucking Chevy Nova in fucking trees and flew off the island.  That's terrible.  Well, someone made an airstrip.  I know, but it was fucking collapsing.  I know.  Well, the island was coming apart.  I agree, Jimmy. 
[00:50:30]  There's a lot of whys in there, though.  Some of them are not real whys.  Some of them are dumb, but there are some legitimate questions.  Some of them are just dumb whys.  I like, though, that Saeed did wake up with an English accent.  He kind of gave up on that whole Iraqi accent thing and just went with his normal accent  that he has in real life.  He's like, fuck it.  Show's almost over.  I'm not going to bother putting this accent on anymore.  It's too much work.  Why don't we take our first break?  And we'll get into some other things. 
[00:51:00]  Some other things.  Stay there.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  I mentioned a little something during the break, and Jimmy's outraged.  I'm outraged.  Anthony's outraged. 
[00:51:30]  The babysitters are fucking with our show a little more.  It's unbelievable.  I got word, actually, from Club Soda Kenny on the way home yesterday  that E-Rock had to edit a couple bits or one bit that might be playing over the weekend.  How was your day off, fatso?  Good morning to you, too.  That was very unnecessary.  But he did ask you a question.  What are we doing?  Some kind of look at all the interns or something? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, you guys had a discussion last week reminiscing about previous interns,  so we figured we'd do sort of like a tribute to the troupe style show,  but I'm stumbling over this.  Tribute to the troupe style show, but tributing to the interns of the past,  some of the dumbest ones.  Tributing.  I don't know what you're saying.  It was a tribute to the troupe style show.  I'm sorry, Eric.  And why'd you do that, Ant?  I don't know.  Just angry today.  It's what he does.  It's what he does. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, so it's a big tribute to interns from the past.  All the interns over the years?  Like any W interns?  Eyepatch guy?  From about 2004 to now.  Oh, right.  That's another issue.  I forgot about that issue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can't play the old stuff?  No.  Why?  Because the old company's holding us up for that.  CBS?  Yeah.  They're holding us up.  Fucking cunts.  They want so much money for that shit.  It's like, really?  Where are we supposed to get the money to pay for our old stuff?  Assholes.  It's business.  It sucks. 
[00:53:00]  They're all assholes.  Anyway, the bits we can play, it came to my attention on the way home yesterday that  the Cream Pie Jones Duty had bit.  What?  There's problems with the bit now?  Yeah.  Even though we've replayed the bit numerous times in the last few years?  It had to have two series of edits.  One was that we mentioned Pal Talk way too much through the bit.  That's the show we were doing.  What's the problem with that?  They feel that now it's just an unpaid advertisement for Pal Talk.  That was the show we were doing. 
[00:53:30]  But that was the show we did.  And what's the other edit?  The other edit is that at a couple points they felt Jim was...  A couple points?  Two different points.  That Jim was describing the shit too vividly, too graphic.  It's radio.  You have to describe it graphically.  Describe beheadings graphically.  What are they talking about?  It's satellite radio.  This is an XL channel.  It's a bit that's been played many times.  What are they doing?  Their whole thing is they're going to say,  Well, the obscenity of its shit could be construed as really a defecation. 
[00:54:00]  Who thinks this?  Who?  Names.  Gary.  Gary.  What does Gary know about what we do?  That's an incorrect thought.  What does he know about satellite radio?  What's his experience dealing with a show like ours?  The company really freaks out when we have bits that involve defecation.  Opie raised a genius point in the break.  We were talking about this and he said Slumdog Millionaire won the Oscar and they have a visual 
[00:54:30]  depiction of a kid falling into an outhouse.  What you're supposed to think he's covered in shit.  And by the way, another one that did that was Schindler's List.  So don't fucking tell me that our verbal description of something with a video that is not connected  to it.  You never see me shitting.  No.  Ever.  Because maybe I didn't actually shit you silly geese.  Jesus.  Maybe a kid didn't really put shit on his head.  Maybe it's a fucking fake description because we're comics. 
[00:55:00]  You did though.  Of course.  You don't.  Yuck.  There's no.  Yuck.  You need a visual tie in for something to be fucking declared.  This is what it is.  Jesus Christ.  Do not.  I say we don't edit the bit.  We don't edit the bit.  And did Gary take it upon himself and go running to the lawyers like a goody two-shoes, like  a good corporate guy?  I'm guessing he did.  Because he's the one who approached me, I guess, because we played it last week.  How come nobody came to us and just said, this is what we got to do?  I wish you would have come to us, or Gary or anybody would have said, look, this is 
[00:55:30]  what we got to do.  What do you guys want to do?  And how did Jimmy describe the shit?  I'm trying to remember.  At one point.  Mealy?  No, no.  You're talking about how you shit so much that it went higher than the water level of  the toilet.  Don't play the bit.  Don't fucking play an edited bit on satellite.  So what's wrong with that?  It's funny.  I got to check my notes, but it was the description after that as far as the texture and what it  looked like.  Well, go get your notes.  We're discussing it now. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  We hear about this on the air and not yesterday before the bit was edited.  How would you edit a bit and not tell us?  And is the babysitter here so we could discuss this with him?  Not here yet.  Why would you be here if you're responsible for the channel?  There's another bit that I was talking about.  We weren't thinking of playing it, but because we weren't thinking of playing it.  What's the other bit?  Pat Duffy brushing his teeth with duty.  With dog duty.  If you remember that.  Yeah, with dog duty.  That apparently I don't even think can run because of their body fluid and defecation.  What are you talking about? 
[00:56:30]  That was on regular radio.  It's fucking – that was on regular radio and it happened already.  There's copies of that out there in the universe.  Unbelievable.  Schindler's List won the Oscar.  Slumdog Millionaire won the Oscar and they had visual depictions of somebody in liquid shit.  Jim, how about this?  The actual bit that occurred that we're talking about is up on YouTube and it's fine.  Of course.  If you too – here's the rule for anybody. 
[00:57:00]  I understand lawyers don't always know the rules.  Their job is to just justify their jobs.  If you see somebody shitting, it's shit.  That's different.  You never see anybody shitting.  I do not understand why people have time to walk around and think shit up like this to edit a bit or –  My guess was because last week you actually played the YouTube video and you were discussing it. 
[00:57:30]  And then when the intern special came up, they were asking is Cream Pie Jones going to be on this special?  I said yes, we have to.  How come no one came to us and said they're going to edit this bit?  Then they needed a copy of the bit to –  They needed a copy of the material to review it.  This fucking guy is going to ruin our show.  He doesn't know how we do radio.  He doesn't understand this type of radio.  And they throw these guys at us that have no experience.  So now they're going out of their way thinking they're doing the right thing.  They're not doing the right thing.  This is satellite radio.  You're allowed to play a bit where a guy brushes his teeth with a little dog shit.  You're just allowed to do that. 
[00:58:00]  Because there's no real proof.  It could be something that is not really dog – that's the beauty of it.  That's what theater of the mind is.  That's what this is.  How is he helping our show?  I remember a while back.  And because Jimmy described it, I want to know what was edited out.  All right.  I remember a while back, too, that there was a problem with the bit we had with no filter  Paul in the diaper.  Why are we not knowing it?  Because he was shitting in the diaper live in the studio.  Yeah.  Right.  So is there video of him shitting in the studio?  I think we have video of it.  There's a problem with that bit, too? 
[00:58:30]  A while ago.  I think last year I was looking to play it with the company.  Why are you not telling us this until now?  I don't understand.  Eric, why are you telling us this now?  Well, I think the no filter Paul one I have said before.  But this one, how would you edit the bit?  I didn't say it on the air, but I've said it to you guys before.  How would you edit the bit without telling us first?  Wow.  Brian from Chicago.  Brian, go ahead.  Good morning, guys.  I'd like to know if somebody can explain to me why FTC rules are being applied to satellite 
[00:59:00]  radio.  Aren't they supposed to be from FTC rules?  It's not.  I'll tell you what they're doing.  And I don't think the company is crazy to at least consider.  I think they are.  I don't.  You're giving them way too much credit.  There's no precedent for any of this shit.  They're thinking about stuff that might possibly happen.  That's the biggest problem going on here.  That, by the way, has never happened.  Exactly.  So I do have a problem with their logic and their thinking.  Let me at least explain their logic.  It's because we're on everywhere in the United States.  And that means in every small town, every hamlet, every village, they're concerned that 
[00:59:30]  certain little places have obscenity clauses that could just cause lawsuit problems for  the company because you don't know when you're in every single market of the country, you don't  know the ins and outs of every single law.  So they want to try to cut off a problem before it could happen.  All right.  That's a company thinking business.  But when it comes to something like this, where it's theater of the mind and you're not  seeing a guy actually do something, it becomes a very different. 
[01:00:00]  You can't prove obscenity because somebody's describing dog shit when nobody can see dog  shit.  And even if you see something, it could be a Snickers bar.  Yeah.  No, it's Caddyshack.  Caddyshack had a fucking thing that was supposed to be duty floating in the water.  And Bill Murray fucking ate it.  Yeah.  He ate it.  So what are we paying for if it's going to be worth it?  I don't know.  At times, I feel like we did more crazy stuff on regular radio.  Yeah, we did.  We did, right?  At this point?  Yes. 
[01:00:30]  Absolutely did.  And we got guys that just don't understand the Opie and Anthony show and how this type  of radio works.  They don't understand it.  And they're just making it harder and harder for us to entertain our listeners.  This doesn't make any sense.  It's mind-blowing.  All right, sir.  I don't like, and I don't like the fact these bits were edited without us being.  I say we pull the bit.  There's no way you should play an edited bit like that.  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  Well, there you go.  That means they're hurting our show because instead of playing that really, really good 
[01:01:00]  bit, we're going to play a bit that we had no intention of playing just to fill the  time.  That's why this is a problem, Gary.  There's not been an obscenity.  No one's come after a radio show on regular radio or satellite, especially for obscenity.  It just doesn't happen.  It doesn't happen.  It would be a Supreme Court freedom of speech case.  They don't care.  They don't want the case brought.  No, I know, but it wouldn't be brought. 
[01:01:30]  It would never be brought is the problem.  No one's bringing a duty case to the fucking Supreme Court over fucking satellite radio.  How is this?  The FCC would absolutely fine a station for doing that.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Under indecency, not obscenity.  Under indecency.  You would not get an obscenity rap.  They don't hand them out.  They just don't.  It's too much trouble.  Oh, let me.  I have a real problem.  Eric, I love you, but I'm really annoyed that you edited these bits without coming to 
[01:02:00]  us first.  Yeah, we should have been informed.  Why does anything have to be edited?  That's a very good question.  I agree.  That's a great fucking question.  You're paying for it.  It's just like as if it was HBO or anything else where they show things that under their  rules would be some type of indecency or obscenity.  I'll walk out.  Obscenity.  Oh, no. 
[01:02:30]  That really bothers me.  And that Slumdog Millionaire example was a brilliant example, and it also goes to Schindler's  List, and we can go to Caddyshack, where something is supposed to be shit, and he fucking  eats it.  Yeah.  But it's not real shit.  Do you think if Bill Murray bit into real shit, there would be a major problem with that  film?  What about the splooge in that Mary flick?  Another great example.  The most splooge thing.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Carmen Diaz.  But she ends up licking her own, licking what, Ben Stiller's splooge?  Had a visual of what was supposed to be cum in her hair.  This is why I have no respect for the babysitters, and I walk past you as quickly as possible  every day, because you're nice guys, and I hear you run terrific music channels, but  what do you know about this type of radio that allows you to fucking tell us what to do?  Give us a guy that knows this shit!  My issue is this.  Now that we explain it like this, maybe if they come to us, I wish we had done this before 
[01:03:30]  it was bits were edited, because if you come to us and we give you these examples, you  may go, oh, okay, that makes sense.  And it's not one...  Believe me, this is...  Any fucking corporate guy thinks like this, it's enraging.  I just don't like the fact those bits were edited before we were told.  It's Panicky Pete's, now just overthinking every bit we've done, every bit we're going  to do.  My silly midget diaper changing bit, we can't do?  No.  We could do it, but we can't what? 
[01:04:00]  They can't leave themselves in the diaper.  As a goof, I said to Anthony yesterday, I'm like, you know what, I want to change the diaper  of a midget.  An adult midget, by the way.  Yeah.  And they would come in, because I've been changing a lot of diapers lately.  And we all laughed, and we're like, ah, what the fuck, it'll kill 10 minutes.  And I'm game.  I found out we're allowed to do it, as long as there's what?  As long as there's no releasing into the diaper.  Well, how do we know if the...  What if I take their diaper off and there's stuff already in it? 
[01:04:30]  Is that a problem, too?  And what about the homeless Charlie bit that we asked for a fucking eight years ago?  What do you know on this one first?  The diaper bit, you can do, but there can't be any excretory functions.  Not that the, um, not the function, you can't have them perform the functions, you can't  have the resulting, the result.  How do you get a piss?  You can't get a piss.  You can't get a piss.  If I take the diaper off, there can't be anything in the diaper, right?  Right.  No, you can have something in the diaper, it just can't be shit or piss.  The party of the first part. 
[01:05:00]  Yes.  Cannot change.  Exhibit number two.  And who told you this?  Uh, Gary.  Gary thinks, and this is my point that I have to make a lot, and they're nice guys, I'm not  going to trash them personally, but he thinks it's totally okay for me to do a bit where  I change the diaper of an adult midget, but there's nothing in the diaper.  How does that make sense and make good radio, Gary?  Proving you have no experience with this shit.  At that point, you go, you know what, we just can't do the bit. 
[01:05:30]  You don't even suggest you do the bit without shit or piss in a diaper.  I honestly don't think you'd want shit or piss in the diaper.  I would fucking put my face right in it and give me shit.  But it's funny if you change your midget's diaper either way.  The funny part is the humiliation of this man laying on his back with his little dumb  legs kicking.  There's no reason to change a diaper if there's nothing wrong with the diaper.  I don't know.  I think that's creepy enough to take the fucking diaper off a grown man with his sweaty midget  balls.  Do you know how nervous he'd be? 
[01:06:00]  His breath would be bad.  His fucking bag and asshole would be sweating.  I think that's a fucking, that would be funny to watch.  Whatever.  But that fucking.  It's a bigger issue is the point I'm making.  It was sent, the homeless Charlie bit, February 24th, was sent to the lawyers to clear.  There's nothing wrong with that bit other than some homeless guy saying fucking what were  not very nice things.  Yeah.  And we have not heard back.  This is the frustrating stuff.  The fact is the bit already aired numerous times because of replays. 
[01:06:30]  And it's just.  It's already aired.  Bits that already aired should be hands the fuck off.  Because they're already out there.  There's copies of homeless Charlie all over the goddamn place.  Why are the rantings of a lunatic off limits?  They're not.  Why is it even questioned?  It shouldn't be.  Any lawyer.  I almost said worth his salt and then realized I'd have to fucking kill myself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But any lawyer should look at that and go, that's really, it's not an issue.  It's some crazy guy expressing his opinion. 
[01:07:00]  If he was on the news and wasn't using profanity, they would show that.  They fucking.  Videos air of these guys declaring jihad on the U.S.  And we can't have some homeless guy referring to Laura Bush.  Is that Bush bitch?  Yeah.  Come on, guys.  What are you doing?  Well.  And that's the lawyers.  Come on.  Let's go to Steve in Alabama.  Yes.  Steve.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey, in Shawshank Redemption, he crawls through a pile of shit, too.  A whole tunnel of it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's right. 
[01:07:30]  And these are visual depictions of what is supposed to be shit.  Yeah, it's radio.  You don't know if it's real or not.  And Danny's bringing up a picture of the shit monster from Dogma.  Is that what it's called?  Oh, yeah.  It's like, come on.  You got to think that way.  That's how ludicrous the defecation.  To have a guy really shitting and pissing in studio, fine.  They don't want that.  I understand that.  Because that's a real thing a guy is doing in the studio.  But to a past description?  Yeah.  A past description?  Let's go to Tim in Iowa. 
[01:08:00]  Tim.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hi, Tim.  Hey, uh, you know, the shit thing, yeah, that's gross enough.  But what about, like, a movie like Van Wouten, where they imply that they jack the dog off  into an eclair and show people eating it?  Exactly.  Right.  There's Beastie Out.  There's all sorts of shit going wrong with that.  There's a toilet scene in Trainspotting.  I was thinking more when, uh, I forget the character's name, but when he shits in the  bed.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He just shits all over the sheets that he has on his hands. 
[01:08:30]  How about the fucking, what was the movie with the Michael Douglas movie?  Where there's actually a really sexy scene.  It might have been Requiem for a Dream or whatever, where she shits and they show the  log falling into the bowl and she says, they don't show it coming out of her asshole.  That's why it's not indecent.  Because if they cannot show her actually shitting, they show her sit on the toilet and then the  camera's in the bowl and you see the log slide down.  And she goes, oh, come on.  I'll let you clean it if you want.  Do you remember that scene?  It was really dirty.  That is dirty.  But it was like, it might have been the Michael Douglas movie where his fucking daughter 
[01:09:00]  was doing drugs.  It was one of those.  It was, uh...  Blow?  Might have...  Not Blow.  The other one.  Traffic.  Traffic.  Thank you.  It might have been 21 Grams or it might have been Requiem.  It was one of those films.  Uh, South Park.  Sure.  Mr. Hankey.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, cartoons.  Different.  Well...  You can get away with anything.  But they are...  Basic Cable is a very good example of what this is.  It's everywhere and it's a pay service.  Now, if the babysitter, Gary, had any experience with this type of thing, he would have  went to the lawyers with all these examples and said, well, what about this, this, this? 
[01:09:30]  This was an Oscar-winning film.  This was a popular movie as well.  This, this, this, this, this.  But you didn't do that, did you?  I just wish they had come to us first because us giving him this example or anybody this example,  they might have went, oh, that makes sense.  That makes sense.  It's just this knee-jerk reaction that we don't need.  And you shouldn't, you know, you should always come to us first.  And you know what?  It wrecks the quality of the show because now we're going to replace that bit with something  we had no intention of playing because now we have to make up the time.  That's why this is a problem, Gary.  Plays with another shit bit. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, an actual shitty bit.  A bit no one gives a fuck about.  So did you get the description that was cut out?  No, you guys are still talking.  I didn't, I can go, I'll go get it, but, uh.  What is wrong with him?  What?  What?  What?  The note. 
[01:10:30]  Did you read that?  I, I, I didn't feel like reading.  Jesus.  Of course I read it.  Still got to make some kind of jokes on this fucking show.  I don't remember what I read, though.  And I ripped it up because I thought it was top secret stuff.  So I ripped it up to a lot of, a lot of pieces.  Top secret.  They just should come to us.  Come in Jodie Foster's hair in Silence of the Lam.  That's right. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, these are all visual descriptions.  That's right.  And you know what it's supposed to be.  So don't, don't, if we actually have real video of a guy shitting, shitting, and you see shit coming out and you know what, that's different.  But Pat Duffy brushing his teeth with what we're describing as dog shit?  Come on.  You're even giving him too much credit with that.  There's no precedent that you can't do that stuff on satellite radio.  Yeah.  You're giving him too much even with that. 
[01:11:30]  But I understand why they don't want to do that.  That I understand.  Like my common sense goes, that makes sense to me.  I don't.  But a description doesn't.  I don't.  I think it's more detrimental because it cuts down on the outrageous factor.  The, you could talk about anything kind of a thing that satellite radio was supposed to be about.  And that is worse, I think, if you put it on a little scale with the chance that somebody's going to raise a stink and nail them on an obscenity rap. 
[01:12:00]  Ridiculous.  It just doesn't happen.  And going back to what my old friend Anthony taught me many years ago, you can't give them anything.  Because then they're going to just keep taking and taking.  Give them on, they'll take a leg.  Right now satellite radio has a big lead over regular radio.  But you know what?  As the months go by and the years go by, I see the lead is getting less and less.  What are you doing?  Don't make the same mistakes as regular radio.  You got everyone turned on to satellite radio because regular radio fucking blew it along the way. 
[01:12:30]  So what are you going to do?  Do the same exact thing?  You can't be that stupid.  Doody.  Doody.  Oh, yeah.  Caca, doody, poopy.  Shit.  Let's go to Rich in Michigan.  Rich.  These are all examples that if we had someone with experience could have taken to the lawyers and maybe this wouldn't have happened.  Go ahead, Rich.  Yeah, American Pie.  Sean William Scott, he was following a dog around to get the ring. 
[01:13:00]  And he ate dog shit right there.  And there's another.  Didn't he fuck the cake or something, too?  I never saw that.  They're supposed to be cucked.  Fuck the cake.  American Pie had a lot of shit.  Didn't someone drink urine in American Pie?  I haven't seen the movie in a while.  Oh, yeah.  Cheech and Chong's next movie.  He hands him a fucking jar of piss and he drinks it.  Right.  Right.  So you're saying that Cheech and Chong has more leeway than satellite? 
[01:13:30]  Well.  Also, there was an episode.  I think it was like first or second season of The Office where somebody takes a shit on Michael Scott's floor.  And I do believe they show it.  It's for a very brief moment, but they do show poo on the floor of his office.  Yeah.  So we're just showing how completely ridiculous this is.  Is E-Rock coming back or was that part of the note thing?  Okay.  No, he's got work to do. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, he's got work to do?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  E-Rock's a busy man.  Busy man.  Okay.  I'm going to go that far.  All right.  Incompetent.  People have a lot of questions out there, so whatever.  We'll try to move on, but it's just ridiculous.  Yeah.  We're professional.  That's very frustrating, though, just because you have a bit planned.  You have a bunch of stuff you want to play, because we've got new people listening on Starz.  And then to find out that the bits are getting fucked with, it's like, well, it's annoying.  Mm-hmm.  What about the Two Girls One Cup reaction bits? 
[01:14:30]  Well, that's okay for now, but, you know, I'm sure Gary will run to lawyers and wreck that one, too.  Can't talk about Tub Girl, either.  Right.  No matter how sexy it is.  Must run to the lawyers.  Yuck.  Yuckaroonie.  How about this segment?  It's got to be edited.  It's got to be edited.  It's got to be edited.  It's got to be edited.  Thank you. </pre>
