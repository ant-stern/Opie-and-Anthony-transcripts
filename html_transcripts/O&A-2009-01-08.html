<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts discussing their own and their staff's illnesses, focusing particularly on the intricacies – and comedic potential – of nose-blowing. This devolved into a humorous, vulgar discussion of nasal hygiene and bathroom sounds.  They then transitioned to a critique of the People's Choice Awards, mocking the lack of edginess in winning films and TV shows like *The Dark Knight*, *Iron Man*, *27 Dresses*, *Tropic Thunder*, *Two and a Half Men*, and *Ugly Betty*.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a bizarre divorce case involving a man suing his ex-wife for the monetary value of the kidney he donated to her after discovering her infidelity.  Opie and Anthony found the lawsuit amusing but criticized the man's lawyer, Dominic Barbera.  This spurred a discussion about organ donation, its emotional toll, and the responsibilities involved, featuring caller anecdotes, including one about a brother refusing to donate a kidney to a sibling. The hosts shared their own perspectives on organ donation, revealing varying levels of willingness depending on the recipient's relationship to them.  The show also briefly covered the firing of Jets coach Eric Mangini, the upcoming college football national championship game, and concluded with commentary on online celebrity photos, including a supposedly revealing picture of Jessica Simpson.

Anthony's aversion to having children was a major topic. He detailed his previous attempts to feign attempts at conception with his ex-wife, confessing to actively preventing pregnancy.  He elaborated on his reasons, ranging from the perceived loss of freedom to anxieties about responsibility. Callers shared their experiences with parenthood and offered psychological interpretations of Anthony's behavior, suggesting diagnoses like narcissistic personality disorder or sociopathic tendencies.  A humorous anecdote involved Anthony's sperm being compared to Nazis at Nuremberg during a fertility test.

The show then discussed anti-Semitic protesters in Fort Lauderdale, employing offensive language. A video clip of a news reporter falling in the snow prompted more off-color commentary.  Ann Coulter's upcoming appearance was heavily promoted, including a clip of a contentious interview with Matt Lauer.  They discussed Obama's lunch with former presidents and Ann Coulter's controversial comments about 9/11 widows. A fake news report about Anthony potentially developing schizophrenia was also aired before Ann Coulter joined the show.

Ann Coulter’s in-studio interview focused on her book, "Guilty Liberal Victims and Their Assault on America," and her criticisms of liberals and the mainstream media.  She discussed the fairness doctrine and the perceived suppression of conservative viewpoints.  Following the interview, listener feedback, heavily polarized between support and opposition for Coulter, was read.  The hosts then debated racism in America and its prevalence in certain employment sectors.

A significant portion was dedicated to a Guitar Hero competition between show staffer Danny and intern Evan.  Extensive time was spent discussing listener comments about the contest, allegations of past cheating, and introducing Tank Tankerous (initially misidentified as Hank) as a hype man.  The competition itself involved difficulties with a cheat code, eventually leading to Evan's victory in two rounds. Danny’s frustration, accusations of cheating, and insults towards Evan dominated the post-game discussion.  A caller even suggested Danny "suck some more" dildos.  A game developer, Justin from Eversoft, called in to offer Evan a signed game copy. The segment ended with Evan's unsuccessful attempt at "Through the Fire and the Flames."  Jimmy Norton also called in to complain about a malfunctioning phone.

The final segment involved "Liquid Ass," a product whose overwhelming stench caused chaos in the studio.  Opie, Anthony, E-Rock, and Butcher reacted with profanity-laden descriptions and comparisons to feces, diarrhea, cadavers, and bad breath. Butcher even removed his clothing due to the smell. The hosts recounted audience members' reactions and planned future pranks using the product, including placing it in a Starbucks.  A brief, ultimately abandoned discussion of the popularity of Wii Sports versus Super Mario Brothers also occurred. The segment concluded with plans for future pranks and a promotion for a website contest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  And we're off!  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's on the road.  Where everyone's sniffling.  What's the matter?  I don't know, Stunt Brain has this weird, deep voice going on.  I'm like, if you're sick, go home.  He's like, no, I feel alright.  Go home?  I hate the people that come in here when they're sick.  Sometimes we have to, because we have no choice.  But the behind-the-scenes guys.  There's Kenny sneezing in the corner over there. 
[00:00:30]  There's some sniffles in the air.  Well, now he's not there.  I'm not seeing.  I just go through a whole ritual of like,  should I blow my nose in the morning?  Should I just leave and wait?  And then it gets so annoying.  You do that thing where you're like...  And you feel something moving up and down in your nostril.  It gets too annoying.  So you're like, ah, now I've got to blow my nose.  And it's a big project.  Blowing my nose is a big project.  Because I've got to be in front of a mirror. 
[00:01:00]  I can't just blow my nose.  Why?  Because...  No.  Because I won't be sure if everything is out of the way.  Like, and clear.  I hate...  I don't want to be the guy that walks around and like,  hey, how you doing?  You've got big snot in your nose.  So I've got to be there.  And then I've got to take the tissue and make a twisty.  And then, rah, rah, give a little auger action in there.  And get everything off of the sides.  You know, I like leaving with a completely, ah, clean nose. 
[00:01:30]  You don't have a good blow.  No, I do.  If you have a good blow, you just know it's clear.  Dude, sometimes it's like bubble gum.  It sticks to the side.  You've got to, like, ream out.  You've got to ream it.  People hate us.  You're waking up to this.  Martin.  Martin.  You ever get the, like, the whole side of the nose is, is, is like a coat of paint.  Yeah, coated.  And then, and then you give it a good blow and you look.  You always have to look to see.  No, never look.  You've got to look.  I look at...  What's wrong with you?  That's why I've got to be by a mirror. 
[00:02:00]  I look in my nose to make sure nothing's there.  I never look in the tissue because I don't want to see it.  You've got to look to see what you accomplished.  And then when you see that coat of paint, like, just perfectly in the tissue, you're like,  all right, I've got a good blow.  Got a good blow in.  Looks like a cornflake sometimes in the tissue.  All right.  Look, to me, any type of mucus is worse.  I know.  I know, Anthony.  It's the second worst bodily fluid or bodily thing.  You were shy when your you-know-what popped out and the babysitter saw it. 
[00:02:30]  Well, yeah, but that had nothing to do with snot.  You flush as you go to the bathroom.  You don't wait till you're done.  I courtesy flush in public bathrooms.  Also, I don't want...  I hate making sound effects.  Uh-huh.  So, you know, you use the flush to kind of cover up the sound effect.  You know, as I get older, I don't care about the sound as much.  Well, you know something?  As people get older, they don't care about anything, apparently.  Oh, you know what?  They don't care about the way they're dressed.  They don't care about ear or eye hair.  Yeah.  Brow hair, nose hair. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, no, I care about all that stuff.  People just give up.  No, I'm just saying, as people get older, they just give up.  Sure, on everything.  But, I mean, if the sounds are pretty impressive, then I'll just have to sit in the stall and  wait for everybody to leave the bathroom.  There's a certain...  Because I don't want to be seen then.  But if it's a little, you know, whatever, then I just walk out.  You know, I've been in public bathrooms where there's sound.  Oh, have you?  Yeah, yeah.  I give a little tap with my foot.  And I put my foot under the stall and hit a cop's foot with it and hope for the best. 
[00:03:30]  And then pull out all the PVA cards and hope that...  Yeah, yeah.  But there's your standard sounds of bodily functions.  But then there's the people that have to go like...  Oh, I hate that.  That is the worst.  And I don't want to hear the pleasure you're deriving from this.  You shouldn't have pleasure from that.  Some people say they have a little pleasure from that.  You know, it's fine to, like, have a little pleasure, like, all right, at least that's 
[00:04:00]  out of, you know, out of here.  Yeah.  At least that's done-ski.  Yeah.  But in a public bathroom, you know, you can moan to your heart's content at home, whatever  you want to do.  Public bathrooms have a little pride.  You really should try to stay a bit quiet.  Getting back to the nose thing, though.  Yeah.  You ever had a whistler?  Yeah, whistlers suck.  You ever wake up in the middle of the night because you have a whistler?  Yeah.  And you know something's keeping you awake and you're like, what is going...  What the...  Yeah, what is that? 
[00:04:30]  Then you've got to blow your nose.  The nice whistler, yeah.  And once you do anything, when you wake up in the middle of the night, you just screwed  yourself.  If you wake up, all I want to do is move one open eye to the clock and see what time  it is and then shut it.  The second you move a finger or something, you're up.  Your body's like, all right, up time.  Yeah.  So to get up and actually blow your nose, which, you know, gets your blood pressure up in your  brain.  Now your brain's being fed by more blood and more thoughts are coming out. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Oh, enough.  It is, uh, it is annoying.  Slept till 5.30 in the afternoon.  Oh, I thought you were going to say 5.30 this morning.  No, that would have been a hell of a...  Would I transport myself here?  You would think after four years of doing, uh, morning radio, you'd have it sort of figured  out.  I know you never totally get used to this, but...  Vacation screwed me.  But you've got to know if you sleep till 5.30 in the afternoon, that's going to not help 
[00:05:30]  you on the other side.  Yeah, but you know what?  Like, it's so good at the time.  I was going to sleep.  When I was going to sleep, I was going, oh, oh, oh, because it felt so good to sleep.  How many hours did you sleep after the show?  From like noon to 5.30?  Something like that?  My truck was in the, uh, driveway, still going, click, tick, click, click, making the  truck cooling off noises as I was in bed, in bed, asleep. 
[00:06:00]  I looked at the clock and went, I'm exactly 12 hours, I'm in bed exactly 12 hours after  I went to bed, uh, the night before.  Uh-huh.  And I'm back in bed.  And then I slept, I woke up, I look at the clock, it was like 5.30.  I just went, I, I, that was my sleep.  And then I took a nap, me and Travis was talking about this, my naps have turned into my sleep  and my sleep is now my nap.  I nap before the show, but I sleep after the show. 
[00:06:30]  Does that work out for you?  No, nothing works.  I just, I hate going to bed at 9.30.  Terrible.  I, I go to bed at 9.30.  I try, I go to bed, but I don't go to sleep.  I find myself last night, I got one eye open, I'm watching Survivor Man in the snow making  something out of pieces of a plane.  Yeah.  And I'm like, why am I up?  The hell am I doing awake?  I roll, I roll over and out loud, I just go, you go to sleep.  No! 
[00:07:00]  We got a lot to do today, man.  Lots.  You see the front page of the paper today?  This divorce story?  This is a biggie.  We were, uh, we want to go rah-rah for this guy, but then we see who his lawyer is, and  now we're in a quandary.  I'm not.  A bit of a quandary.  Screw him.  Screw the guy?  Screw the guy, make him give her his kidney.  But you got to support the guy every time in divorce cases.  Sorry, ladies, but, you know, the guys get screwed out there. 
[00:07:30]  We all know that by now.  And I know a few women will go, well, no, not Mike.  I had a pain.  I was the one that ended up, all right, miss one in a million, shut it.  No kidding.  We do get a couple.  We'll acknowledge that.  But then the phones are just like lit for over an hour with guys just getting screwed  left and right in these divorce cases.  And the reason the girl walks away, uh, um, uh, getting taken in a divorce is because  you married a bum.  You married a bum. 
[00:08:00]  You know what we're going to do?  Because we don't want to rush through this story.  When we get back, we're going to tell you what this man wants back from his wife in the  divorce case.  This is wonderful.  This is a wonderful little case.  Yep.  Uh, and we'll talk about that in just a few minutes.  We're just warming up here.  Representing him.  Well, that's where the problem comes in, right?  And the phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Just getting started.  Opie and Anthony.  Let's get right back into this.  Opie and Anthony.  People's Choice Awards were on last night. 
[00:08:30]  It's really tough to watch those award shows, right?  There was a time they were kind of cool, no?  They were giant, man.  Award shows were, uh, because there were only a couple of them.  Yeah.  And then it got to the point where every week there was another stupid award show, uh,  and now I think there's been a backlash where people just don't care anymore.  And then MTV did a good job with their award shows because they were kind of mocking award  shows as they were giving out awards, and then MTV started taking themselves very serious  with their music awards and their movie awards. 
[00:09:00]  We have to put this on delay because last year somebody said a bad word.  And the problem with that, those executives, they should have maybe just put their broadcast  on delay without telling people.  Yeah.  But these idiots that think they know better get the word out that, uh, well, our show  is now on delay.  So as you as a viewer, there's a, there's a big chunk of people that watch this stuff  thinking, oh my God, something crazy could happen.  You know these, you know, these, uh, Hollywood actors are pill popping and drinking and then 
[00:09:30]  they're going to go on stage.  I could see something cool, but you realize, no, because there's a delay and nothing's going  to happen and it's very safe, safe, safe, safe.  That's what we got to keep it for the children.  To the executives out there in the media business, there's a lot of people that don't want safe.  Yeah.  It's just a fact.  Safe isn't fun.  But I'm looking at the winners from last night and, uh, someone's got to talk, speak 
[00:10:00]  up about this dark night movie we kind of have on this show.  The dark night was a good movie.  What are you talking about?  It was a good movie.  It wasn't a great movie.  Heath Ledger was amazing and should get something for that.  The movie itself was a little long winded and, um, boring in spots.  Sure.  When you find yourself, if you go, if you watch dark night a second or third time, when  you find yourself, you know, you're, you're just waiting for Heath Ledger to go back on 
[00:10:30]  screen.  Yeah.  That's a sign that maybe the rest of the movie isn't as great as everyone thinks it is.  Right?  Yeah.  But it won best movie last night.  People's choice awards on the people's choice.  Now, Anthony, I think you're the only one that might've seen all three movies that were  up.  There were only three up.  Yeah.  I saw two out of the three.  It was, uh, the dark night, saw it, Indiana Jones, saw it, and Iron Man saw it.  I asked you my friend, which one was the best movie out of those three? 
[00:11:00]  Best movie out of those three was Iron Man.  I'm with you.  But I didn't see Indiana Jones.  So it's not too, you know, Indiana Jones was, uh, it paled in comparison with the, uh,  the other ones.  Yeah.  Times change.  Things are different.  And, uh, you know, you can't pull a, a sequel out of your crack, uh, that many years later  and have it actually be relevant to the other movies, you know?  Uh-huh.  So it, it kinda, I didn't like it. 
[00:11:30]  Didn't like it at all, as a matter of fact, the, uh, the last Indiana Jones they made.  Cause it's like, it's not an Indiana Jones movie.  It was something else.  Right.  Starring Harrison Ford as a character that's like Indiana Jones.  Yeah.  Too much time has passed.  Yeah.  So it, they add in things that are too today, even though it's supposed to be, you know,  back, it just, I didn't like it.  You know what they should have done with that movie, like they're doing with a lot of these  other franchises?  Just start over.  Yeah.  Don't even acknowledge that Harrison Ford ever did the movies. 
[00:12:00]  They stand on their own.  People will find them and, and, and check them out.  Worked with James Bond.  Right.  And just get a new young guy with new adventures and just, and just, uh, start the franchise  over.  Start anew.  Uh, I'm looking at, go, go back, uh, down.  Uh, Iron Man kicked ass by the way.  I loved Iron Man.  It was a great movie.  And I've seen that, uh, twice now.  And that movie is just solid all the way through.  Just solid.  Uh, favorite comedy.  Could you go back down there, Danny?  Or the other way.  Sorry.  Um, favorite comedy was 27 Dresses. 
[00:12:30]  What?  Was that a chick flick?  Yeah.  Didn't some good comedies come out this year?  Well, some of those other comedies we got.  Well, here's the problem.  The three movies that were up for this award, 27 Dresses, did not see it.  Get Smart, I would never go see that.  That was up for an award?  And Mamma Mia.  Oh, isn't that the ABBA, uh, wasn't this the year of, like, Pineapple Express?  Yep.  And, and Tropic Thunder?  Yep.  And, uh, what other, what other big movie, uh, came out that, in the comedy category? 
[00:13:00]  Tropic Thunder was hilarious.  Now, I did not, I didn't see 27 Dresses, Get Smart, or Mamma Mia, but safe to say, I  Yeah, safe to say I would not enjoy those movies.  That's a throwaway, like, dumb movie.  Tropic Thunder was at least original.  Yeah.  I mean, you know something, uh, I watched Tropic Thunder, and, uh, I thought it was  overrated, but it was funny.  It was funny, it was okay, they took some chances, which was good. 
[00:13:30]  I thought it was more than okay.  But I, I didn't find it like, that Tom Cruise, man, was hilarious.  Yeah, that was, that was funny, his character was really funny.  The movie, though, uh, I don't know.  Yeah.  I wasn't feeling like, wow, this is really, I didn't feel like I was watching a, you  know, classic comedy that's gonna be around for a while.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, they did, they did a pretty good job, though.  27 Dresses, what, that has to be a chick flick, right?  What was it?  Some kind of wedding thing, looking for a wedding dress?  Uh, I guess. 
[00:14:00]  If memory serves, I do believe, uh, it's about, uh, some reporter that's doing some  kind of piece on theme weddings.  Uh, I think.  God damn.  Ugh.  Ugh.  And I'm kind of glad that I really don't know if that's the actual synopsis or not.  Hey, I'll tell you.  You moe.  I'll tell you, I saw Zack and Miriam make a porno this, uh, past year.  I would, see, I, I guess I'm out of this discussion, because, uh, it's not fair if you  haven't seen these movies, but why would I sit through Mamma Mia?  Mm.  Why would I sit through Get Smart after seeing the, uh, the trailer for that crap? 
[00:14:30]  Isn't Mamma Mia the ABBA thing?  Yes.  Isn't that a musical?  Yes.  Yes.  How is that a comedy?  I have no idea.  No idea.  Hmm.  People's choice, huh?  Yeah, the people's choice.  Who are the people?  Uh.  Oh, girl.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And some of these other categories, I don't know.  Favorite, all right, I'll, I'll, favorite, uh, TV show?  TV.  All right. 
[00:15:00]  Favorite TV show, what do you think?  I would probably say that stupid Two and a Half Men.  Hey, where's the favorite TV show there, uh, Danny?  I see reality, I see game show, I see, just favorite TV show.  Is it Ugly Betty?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ugly Betty's good.  Uh.  You like Ugly Betty, Jim?  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ugly Betty.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You can't even say it with contempt on it. 
[00:15:30]  No.  Contempt on it.  Well, they, they break it up.  Uh, favorite TV drama?  Drama?  What would you guess?  I would say one of those god-awful CSI shows.  CSI is up there.  It was up for, uh, you know, the big win, but it lost.  Boston Legal.  Boston Legal did not make it.  Ah.  A drama?  A drama.  It was, uh, I'll give you the three.  All right.  Um, house, CSI, or Grey's Anatomy.  Ah, that would be house then.  They don't do cable, only regular TV?  Ah, I don't know. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, what happened with the edgy shows that actually have realistic language?  Grey's Anatomy was good.  I saw that once.  A hospital drama.  I kind of liked the, you know, ER back in the day.  Yeah, I never liked it.  So, I took a peek at Grey's Anatomy, I was like, no effing way.  No.  They turned, like, ER into, like, a chick show, and called it Grey's Anatomy.  Yeah.  I just couldn't do it.  But, yeah, you're right, house won.  And then, favorite TV comedy.  My god, I just don't watch these comedies. 
[00:16:30]  Is it my name is Earl?  What's wrong with my name is Earl?  Nothing.  That had a pretty good run.  I'm sure it did.  Did you ever watch it?  No.  Why not?  I'm prejudging it.  I watched the first couple of seasons, and then just lost it.  But I kind of liked it at first.  Yeah, at first it was really funny.  I would put 30 Rock as best comedy, but it wasn't even up for the award.  No, huh?  Yeah.  Two and a Half Men?  Two and a Half Men was in there.  Samantha Who.  What?  And Jimmy's Ugly Betty, all up for favorite TV comedy. 
[00:17:00]  Ugly Betty.  Ugly Betty is funny.  And you've got to give it to Two and a Half Men, a show I'm proud to say I've never  seen.  I've watched it.  I've never seen.  I've watched two episodes separated by probably months.  Yeah.  And I didn't get it.  I didn't get when the laughs came in.  I was just bamboozled and flustered watching it going. 
[00:17:30]  I don't find this funny, but the studio audience is laughing.  Are they, though?  Or is it a little like push this button for a big laugh?  A big applause sign?  I don't know.  You know, we were just talking about the Honeymooners recently.  When the studio audience was laughing, you knew they were laughing.  Oh, yeah.  These sitcoms, is it a real laugh?  Is it some guy in a booth, you know, sweetening up the jokes or what?  You don't know. 
[00:18:00]  Actually, you kind of know because it sounds like it's fake laughter.  There's nothing really, really edgy out there and original and just something that makes  you go, wow, I'm watching something here like classic.  Something that's going to be around for a while.  Congrats to our old friend Jay Moore.  Favorite new TV comedy, Gary Unmarried, wins the award.  He got an award?  That's strong for Jay.  That is very good.  Very, very strong for Jay. 
[00:18:30]  Congratulations to Jay Moore.  From him until he's back in the gutter again.  Well, that's how it happens.  Favorite animated comedy?  Favorite animated comedy.  Is this a movie or a TV show?  TV show.  There's a lot of good animated TV shows.  I would have to say.  I'll give you the list, and I might be scrambling them because I know you're a smart dude.  You got South Park, The Simpsons, Family Guy.  Well, I believe they probably give it to The Simpsons. 
[00:19:00]  Correctamundo.  Yeah, although they should give it to second place, which is Family Guy.  Correctamundo.  Yeah.  Well, there's no second place, really.  Well, South Park is strong.  South Park's strong, but it's a little too crazy for people.  Yeah.  Wow, The Simpsons.  Are you done with The Simpsons?  Yeah.  How long has that show been on now?  Forever.  It was on the Texaco Home Theater.  Really?  I think they're in their 19th or 20th year or something like that.  Yeah, if you think back to that, what's her facey show there? 
[00:19:30]  Tracy Ullman.  Tracy Ullman.  Wow.  Dude, that was on forever ago.  Yeah.  That was an 80s show.  Not even late 80s.  That show was on in the 80s, and The Simpsons was just a little snippet on her show.  A little side project.  Name one thing from her show.  Except for The Simpsons.  You can't.  Right.  She was a different lady in every sketch. 
[00:20:00]  She's been on television since 1966, and I would not recognize her if she walked in  the room.  I don't know what she looks like.  No.  And then she got her big song with Paul McCartney.  Remember that one?  It was a video.  What?  Hopping on her.  She had a hit song.  Wait, I'm trying to remember.  She did.  She had a hit song in the 80s.  It got a huge rotation on MTV.  Give me that song.  Pop that song up.  Look for Tracy Ullman on the music.  Huh? 
[00:20:30]  They don't know about us.  They don't know about us.  Well, we were trying to guess, Steve.  Steve guessed.  And he won.  Yeah, Steve won.  I couldn't wait to come in and show everyone he had knowledge.  You don't remember that song?  Well, now that he said that, yes, sure.  And then at the end, it's Paul McCartney and her in that little car, and they're driving  around.  They hit a motorcycle, and there's a model on it.  Yeah.  How desperate was Paul McCartney for a hit?  Why would he work with Tracy Ullman?  I don't know, but that was at the time where he was working with Michael Jackson and everything 
[00:21:00]  else, so he had a lot of hit songs.  I think it was just one of those things.  Right.  You got a little taste of that?  I think the guy is also in that that got the alien ripped out of his stomach.  Oh, wow.  That was cool.  A little strange.  I'm not sure, though.  Maybe it was a different song.  Let me go to Rob on Long Island for a second.  Rob.  Hey there, Rob.  Hey, Rob.  How you doing, guys?  Yeah.  In the past, I know you guys have always bashed House, and I was on that bandwagon, too,  just from all those ridiculous promos that you guys played.  But, Anthony, have you actually ever just sat through an episode? 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  You have.  I've sat through an episode of House, and I find it horrid.  Yeah, you don't know this.  Really?  I just honestly think the writing is good, but the plot lines are good, just the illnesses  that they show.  I don't know.  I've watched it.  Me and my wife decided to just get it on Netflix, and we've watched every episode since.  We just think it's just hilarious.  But, okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  I mean, I don't have no opinion.  Rob, let me jump in.  You don't really know the show well.  Anthony gets freaked out by these hospital shows. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, okay.  He can't get past the fact that you can all of a sudden have an itchy ear, and next thing  you know, you're dead from pancreatic cancer or whatever the hell.  They scare the crap out of you with this stuff you've never heard of before.  Well, you can't.  Don't say I don't know the show well enough.  I've been listening since 2004.  I didn't say that.  No, I know you know the show, but it was just a way of explaining where Anthony stands.  I know.  House is so wild.  Wouldn't House have had his medical license revoked in episode one?  And the guy, I mean, come on. 
[00:22:30]  You've got to suspend that stuff.  Do you?  You've just got to, like, go with it a little bit.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Everyone's bleeding from a private area on that show.  He once almost lost his license from stealing a dead guy's Vicodin because he was jonesing  because he was, I don't know, it's a whole big plot line, but, yeah, there was a dead guy  who died of cancer, and he went to the pharmacy and signed out his Vicodin, and then he almost  lost his license for that.  It's just, yeah, you've got to suspend disbelief, you know, for most part. 
[00:23:00]  I like one doctor show, and it's on the History Channel.  It's called Mingala.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Later, Rob.  Bye.  By the way, I did not bring the painting in today.  What?  I'm trying to build up the mystique of the painting.  That's where I'm at with this right now.  You're going to build up a pissed-off co-host.  I want to see this goddamn painting.  That's exactly what I'm going for, see?  See?  You know, and then when I finally bring in the painting, it's going to be that much more 
[00:23:30]  special for everybody.  Is it?  Yes.  Yes.  So, because people are asking.  I did not bring it in.  Maybe tomorrow.  Yeah.  Tomorrow might be the day.  It better be.  I'm not really sure if it's going to rain in New York or not.  I don't want to ruin this thing.  Sure.  Sounds like you want to.  I sure do.  Use it as an umbrella.  All right, so there's a divorce case going on, and God, we love what this guy's trying  to accomplish.  We hate his lawyer, though.  Yeah.  Simple as that. 
[00:24:00]  That's the thing that threw me.  Simple as that, but let's get right into the story here.  When I donated, the next day it was on my feet.  I guess it needs a setup, unfortunately.  It certainly needs a setup.  All right.  A husband is talking here how he gave his wife a kidney.  Isn't it amazing?  The odds were, like, astronomical that he would be able to supply a kidney for this  woman's failing kidneys.  Uh-huh.  One in 700,000.  700,000.  And she had rejected two previous transplants. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Wait, so this guy was, like, almost a perfect match?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  And what are the odds of that, you know?  Right.  But then, you know, she gets his kidney, and apparently she had rejected, what, two other  kidneys?  But she wasn't rejecting other organs, that's for sure, because they, uh, ba-dum-ki-ish.  You know why?  That's pretty good, though.  Because she was an adulteress. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  After she got this kidney, she decided she was going to just start cheating on the guy.  According to this guy, she was cheating with a physical therapist.  Yeah.  And what else?  There was all sorts of, uh...  Summon out of guys she was cheating with!  All sorts of shenanigans going on.  Yeah.  But here's the story.  The guy talking about how he gave his wife a kidney.  When I donated, the next day I was on my feet, going down the hallway to go visit her  in the adjoining room.  There is no greater feeling...  She was having sex with the doctor.  Can you imagine? 
[00:25:30]  That's what I thought he was going with that.  I walked in the room, and...  Uh-oh.  She was taking her medication orally.  Yes.  What I mean by medication is...  The doctor was giving her pure protein, saying it helped the kidney.  Right.  There is no greater feeling in this planet.  God is my witness.  I felt as if I could put my arm around Jesus Christ.  Wow.  It was an unbelievable...  Unbelievable.  I was walking on a cloud. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  With his head in the clouds, doctor.  Huh?  Do you do that with Jesus?  You just put your arm around and go, hey.  Hey, Jesus.  Jesus.  Want to go get a brew?  Hey, buddy.  Buddy boy.  Shouldn't you be a little bit...  Show a little bit more, like, reverence for the Jesus?  Like, I could just smack him on the ass and go, hey, thanks.  You've got a guy in a bar you're bonding with, you idiot.  Yeah.  Supposedly the son of God, according to some of us.  I hate the people that have a reference point for Jesus, like he lives in the clouds or 
[00:26:30]  something.  Yeah.  Enough of that.  I was walking on the clouds.  If there is, like, a Jesus or a God or whatever you believe in, you know, stop at the reference  point.  It's all-encompassing.  It's all around you.  Not building these wonderful pearly gates on water vapor in the sky.  Right.  Right above the clouds.  Why do we need a reference point for this stuff?  It comes from the ancient times when people didn't know crap.  Yeah.  They go, oh, it lives on the clouds.  Yeah, does it?  Does it?  What happened?  It's a water vapor, doesn't it? 
[00:27:00]  It just makes for a better story.  Yeah.  A better fairy tale, as some people believe out there.  Well, originally they thought Christ lived in Marvin Gardens, and then they felt that  that was just not, didn't sound holy enough.  No, it doesn't.  They said, all right, put him in the clouds.  But with his head in the clouds, Dr. Petitza's world came quickly crashing down.  He said, shortly after the transplant, his wife began cheating on him.  Oh, boy.  The couple is now in the middle of a bitter divorce battle.  But most of all, Dr. Petitza wants his kidney back, or at least what it's worth. 
[00:27:30]  In theory, we actually asked for the return.  Ugh.  That voice is making me cringe.  And this is where we hate the story.  This is where we hate the story.  This is where we hate the story.  I've heard this voice in a courtroom, and it gives me a tummy ache.  It's Dominic Barbera.  It is him, right?  Yes.  Who represented the man.  But now representing this guy, right?  Yeah.  He's representing the guy.  He, of course, was representing my ex.  Yuck.  And now he's, I guess, trying to get the financial value of the kidney. 
[00:28:00]  What a jerk.  Well, he is good with certain parts of the body.  Because I know what he did to me.  I couldn't sit down for a week.  And he attempted to take a few parts of your body in the process.  He went for the lungs.  Well, yeah.  Go for the lungs.  Why not go for the kidney?  Bastard.  He attempted to get your, uh, your, uh, huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Took the, uh, the scrote and everything.  I like to call it the bully balls.  Oof. 
[00:28:30]  In theory, we actually asked for the return of the kidney.  But, of course, he wouldn't really ask for that.  But the value of it.  The asking price for the kidney?  One and a half million dollars.  Something of an idea of what the value is to get something that would keep you on your feet  and not prevent you, and prevent you from being disabled, being at home, going to dialysis  three times a week for three hours at a clip.  Uh.  Uh-huh. 
[00:29:00]  Then what is the future earnings of the kidney?  There's a potential future earnings for a kidney.  Yeah.  But with his head in the clouds, Dr. Batista's world came quickly crazy.  Yeah, okay.  I was making sure that we play that.  Yeah.  So that's a wonderful story today, huh?  Yeah.  Wow.  Boy, that is a kick in the ass, though, for the guy.  It's not an easy choice to be like, eh, you know, if your wife needs a kidney, I always 
[00:29:30]  wonder that, you know, a wife or a brother or someone close to you needs a kidney and  you're a match.  It's like, oh, God.  I've got to be a match.  Now you've got to make that decision.  Are you going to be the give the kidney guy?  There's no decision to be made.  I mean.  What?  You have to do it.  Do you?  Yes.  There are other people out there.  What about some guy?  You give a kidney and then you find out the next day some stupid teen wrecked his car,  chopped his head off in the wreck, and he's a perfect match.  But you're going to sit there and let your, like, loved one sit in the hospital waiting 
[00:30:00]  for that moment hopefully to happen?  Right until the bitter end, maybe.  I mean, I would give it in a second.  I wouldn't be happy about it.  I'd be like, oh, this is scary and something I wasn't looking forward to doing.  But I think you've just got to step up and do it right away.  I'd be like, I don't think I'm a match.  You would be really freaked out to the point.  I'm not a match.  What would be the odds that you would actually do it?  I probably wouldn't.  Really?  It would depend on who it is.  I guess.  It's one of your, either your sister or your brother. 
[00:30:30]  Probably brother or sister.  That's probably the only case where I would.  Mom, getting too old, waste of a good kidney.  Seriously.  Yeah.  She wouldn't want my kidney.  She'd be going to go, get out of here.  I'm old.  Screw you.  Wow.  I wouldn't.  No.  Why would I give her a kidney?  Because she's your mom.  Yeah.  And she needs it.  She's getting up there.  Screw it. 
[00:31:00]  Jimmy, what are the odds you would do it?  For your sister, your mother, your father, your nephew?  Sister and nephew, yes.  Yeah.  I'd go to, like, Haiti and buy a kid for 300 bucks.  Throw it in a cooler and come back home?  Yeah.  Parents, I don't know.  Like you said, they're old.  Yeah.  It's not worth it.  There's a lot of things that I asked for that didn't receive. 
[00:31:30]  Tell her to get a Van Heusen kidney.  Exactly.  Thanks.  Remember all those sweaters?  I think it's a no-brainer.  I think it's a no-brainer.  It's a kidney.  Yeah.  I'll be honest.  I'll be really freaked out and I'm not happy that I'm going down that road.  But I know of somebody.  I have to keep it vague.  This person needed a kidney.  The brother was a perfect match.  Yeah.  And the brother said, no effing way.  Wow.  And he was young.  He was, like, 19 or 20 at the time. 
[00:32:00]  This person had to go outside the family, even though her brother was a perfect match,  get a kidney from somewhere else.  Okay.  And it's just been horrific ever since.  The kidney was rejected, goes back, now she needs another kidney, or she's going to die,  goes back to the brother, hello, can you help me out?  Brother still says no.  Did he not like her, though?  Huh?  Did the brother just dislike his sister?  What's the relationship?  It seemed like it was, you know, a regular family for the most part. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  So then the father, taking out ads all over Long Island, begging and pleading, my daughter  needs this, even though he knows his son is a perfect match.  The guy put out ads in Newsday and was, you know, nailing things up all over town.  Finally, the father was so desperate, he gave his own kidney to his daughter, even though  he wasn't even close to a match.  How did he do that? 
[00:33:00]  As the brother sat there the whole time.  How did he do that?  With all sorts of rejection, drugs and stuff.  Oh.  You know, when you get into these situations, you do what, you know, it's, let's give this  a shot instead of, you know, instead of fade away and die.  How did it work?  I don't know, because, you know, we're not in touch with this person anymore.  You know, if any story I've heard could have had an ending that I would be interested in.  I know, I'm sorry.  Not with that one.  You know what, I could probably get, I probably could get,  an ending to that story. 
[00:33:30]  That was like watching The Godfather and it ends while Michael is standing Godfather  over the baby and you don't know what happened with family business.  The end.  I can tell you this much.  I would have to assume that this person is still living.  I would have to assume.  But I don't know, you know, what kind of medical issues, you know, she's having because she's  got the father's kidney instead of the brother's kidney.  I'd like to, it's really.  I would know if she's not around anymore.  So she's got, she's still, she's still living.  It's easy to go, I have the brother's a dick and he might be, but it's like, who knows what 
[00:34:00]  she's like?  Does she do drugs?  Like, is she just.  No, no, no, no.  It's just a very, very unfortunate situation for her.  Just one of these diseases that actually is really rare.  And, uh, you know, he passes the first time and then you're passing the second time knowing  and knowing that she's like wasting away and the father's sitting there like, holy crap,  this is my daughter.  And he's sitting there and he's sitting there living in the house still.  He's not even on his own doing his own thing.  It's like, I don't know though. 
[00:34:30]  Given a kidney, it's like, you know, you're on a seven 67 and one engine goes.  I know.  Like, all right, we could still fly, but look, it's rough.  I'm just on one here.  It's a rough thing to think about.  That's for sure.  But I don't know, man.  I mean, for my brothers and sisters in a second.  Really?  Yeah.  I wouldn't be happy.  You got a lot of them too.  So odds are.  Oh, no kidding.  Oh God.  How many do I have these days?  These days?  I'm one of seven and none of them have passed, but you know, growing up, I had extra sisters 
[00:35:00]  and people living in the attic.  So I don't know.  I don't know who I count and who I don't these days.  I don't know.  And, uh, you know, both my brother and sister just have babies.  So maybe they're a match.  The babies?  Who cares?  Grow your own organ donors.  That's what I say.  Uh, you're the worst.  Come on.  Matt on Long Island.  And what if Opie needed a kidney?  Tony, please.  The answer would be no.  Who am I kidding?  Opie needs 10 bucks.  I question it.  I'm not stupid. 
[00:35:30]  Uh, Gabe.  Well, here we go.  We got the stories coming in.  Mark in Sarasota, Florida.  Mark.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Um, wait.  Someone's saying I, hold on.  Someone's saying I told an E-Rock story.  What does that mean?  Because it had no ending?  Well, E-Rock stories normally have no beginning or middle either.  But maybe we just, because it was, uh, I think that was a good story.  And I, I'll give you guys an update.  I'll find out more.  Yeah.  Uh, Opie, quickly, uh, also people are questioning whether your brother would,  uh, print up, I got Opie's kidney t-shirts to sell, uh, at events. 
[00:36:00]  A cartoon kidney with, like, a funny face on it?  Yes, of course.  Sure.  Wow logo on it?  Yeah.  Wow, I gave a kidney.  Uh, go ahead, Mark.  Yeah, about two years ago, I got the call that my sister was on dialysis,  and she needed a transplant that the family members would now get tissue-type  to see if it was a match.  And it turned out I was the only one that was healthy enough.  Lucky you.  And, uh, yeah. 
[00:36:30]  And I wasn't real happy about it, but Opie's right.  It's, you know, you just have to.  It's, there's, there's no way that you can say no.  No, it's, uh, no, it's weird.  Let's say, God forbid, somebody in my family needs a kidney,  and we all go in for that tissue testing.  Yeah.  And you're not a match.  You're, ugh.  And then you go to them, like, you know, man, I was ready to.  I was totally, I was right there.  I was ready for them to wheel me down the hall for you, bro.  But, unfortunately, I'm not a match.  But inside, you're like, thank God.  Also on Pal Talk.  Thank God I don't have to make that decision. 
[00:37:00]  People questioning whether, uh, Steve would put a foundry logo on the kidney before,  uh, it was transplanted.  And, and he'd have it put in the wrong part of the body.  You wouldn't know how to navigate through the body to get to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now go find your kidney.  It's easy to search for.  Sure.  Well, they did give me a little gold-plated TITAC in the shape of a kidney and a T-shirt  that says that I was a kidney donor, so.  They do, they, they, wait, they do not do that.  Yeah, they do.  That's an insult.  TITAC. 
[00:37:30]  That's an insult.  So how, how has it been since?  Um, the first, like, uh, three or four months, it was pretty rough.  But ever since then, uh, I'm doing really well and I'm really healthy and she is too.  Although, she started skimping on her anti-rejection medication and we were a really good match.  So she started to get what they call an acute rejection, which is because she was skimping  on her meds, but she's back on it now and she's learned the lesson.  How annoying is it, by the way, when you give up a kidney?  Extremely annoying.  Yeah, here he knows what you're going to say, but go ahead, Jim.  Oh, no, I was going to say, no, I, wait, did you think I was going to say when you give 
[00:38:00]  a kidney and then she's not upkeeping what she's supposed to?  Yeah.  Exactly.  No, I, I meant like how annoying is it when you give a kidney and it's rejected for whatever  reason, like maybe not even that.  Oh my, can you imagine?  It's like, they can't get it back, can they?  You're like, well, give it back to me.  It was working fine in my body.  Yeah, you want to just look at their dumb body.  So did you call her screaming?  No, I, I just kind of kept my mouth shut because, you know, what's, what's she going  to do?  She made a mistake. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  Listen, the phones are lit, 877-212-018.  People want to talk about this for a little bit and, and I'll tease this.  I got, I got a friend, wait till you hear, uh, about his wife and how she's doing.  And it has something to do with, uh, obviously organ transplants.  I'll wait till you hear this one.  Is it your friend Delbert Grady?  A good, uh, a fellow fraternity brother.  And, uh, wow.  Marshmallow transplant?  No? 
[00:39:00]  No.  Well, uh, I think he was side-by-side with me when we had to do that just horrific homoerotic  thing to get into the fraternity.  Yeah, this makes sense.  All I want to do is drink some beer from a, from a keg and go bang sorority girls.  Why do we have to do this?  Why?  Marshmallow gag.  Opie and Anthony.  I got a quick, I told you so.  I told you so.  I'm a big Jets fan.  What a disaster.  We all know that by now, right?  And then the Jets go and fire Mangini. 
[00:39:30]  And Mangini pretty much didn't want Brett Favre.  He just, he wasn't totally on board with that whole thing.  But he went with it.  And they did pretty well.  And then Brett Favre completely collapsed, like I told everybody out there.  And, and, and when they fired Mangini, I go, look, you watch.  He's going to be coaching somewhere else immediately.  And sure enough, the Cleveland Browns have picked up Eric Mangini to coach their team next year.  Yeah.  He's a young, good coach. 
[00:40:00]  How do you fire him after, after a 40-year-old quarterback has a disastrous second half of the season?  Oh, the head.  How do you do that?  The heads roll.  Yeah, you know what?  Why don't you just hang with your people for a few years?  How many years did he coach?  Three, right?  I think he got three in.  He's good, though.  And he's young.  And, you know, he's hungry.  And now where are the Jets?  They've got to figure out who's going to be coaching the team.  And they've got to figure out who's going to be throwing the ball next year. 
[00:40:30]  Just the worst.  You pick a team yet?  Eagles, Giants?  Of those two, I'd much rather say the Giants.  I hate the Eagles.  Really?  I don't like the Giants.  I hate them against most teams.  Yeah.  But when it comes to Washington, the Giants and Philly, it all depends local.  Like, who's been killing the Cowboys more?  But Philadelphia, I will always hate more than any of those teams.  Yeah.  I can't make a pick.  I could care less. 
[00:41:00]  I don't like either team, so.  Yeah.  I mean, the Giants, it's like, look.  I mean, they're just, I think they're better, so why not?  I'd rather see them go than the Dirty Eagles.  I'm watching football tonight, my friends.  National title on the line.  Go Gators.  Oh, God, that college thing?  I love the college football.  Yeah, all right.  And my nephew, you know, goes to Gainesville, so.  Have fun with that.  We've got to pull for the Gators tonight.  Oh, okay, then that's why.  Yeah.  I root for my alma mater, which is Middlesex Community College. 
[00:41:30]  I went to one semester back in 1987, and I root for them in all the national sports  confrontations.  What's their banner?  Yes, I do.  And it says MCC.  What's their big sport, Jimmy?  What were they good at?  Every college claims to be good at one sport.  Buddy Booth Drillings.  They're amazing at that.  They can put a hole in a wall in under three seconds.  Perfectly beveled hole.  Hey, Chris in Oceanside, you know, I'll give the other side of this for the people. 
[00:42:00]  Man, Genie sucks, and so do the Browns.  Good fit.  So, there you go.  The other side of that issue.  Back to, uh...  You're missing the big news today, bro.  Yeah, what, what, what?  Soupy Sales, 82 years young.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  We saw him 10 years ago on the road, and I thought he was going to die.  Me and Opie were driving in.  It was longer than 10 years ago.  Who the hell knows?  It was like right when we got to New York.  Did he punch Opie's mirror?  No, he wasn't that guy. 
[00:42:30]  Okay.  But he, uh, yeah, he was standing on the side of the road, and we were like,  Hey, Soupy!  And he gives this confused look.  Uh-huh.  And he looked like a corpse standing there.  He's still alive.  Still alive.  Yeah.  Wow.  By the way, you got to see a picture of Kevin Federline.  How fat did this guy get?  What website is that on?  No way that's Kevin Federline.  Just explain to the people, as we're doing the radio show, we got Danny, like,  just surfing constantly, so things just pop up that you got to react to. 
[00:43:00]  There's a picture of Kevin Federline.  He's got to be twice the size...  He's giant.  ...of when he was kind of famous doing the Britney thing.  He's giant.  Is he e-fed now?  Is he called e-fed?  Wow.  Yeah, that's up on the superficial.com.  Superficial.com, and we'll link it on onaradio.com.  And if we're talking about pictures, we got to say hi to our boys at  WhatWouldTylerDurtonDo.com or www.tdd.com, right? 
[00:43:30]  Yes.  Okay.  What would Tyler Durton do?  They got a picture, and they're playing it safe.  They're not sure if it's real, but there's a picture of Jessica Simpson that will give  you an instant chubby.  Yeah.  An instant chubby.  Go to www.tdd.com.  Wow.  If that's real.  And the picture's titled, Holy Crap.  Her big, huge bosoms.  She's sitting...  Her bosoms.  She's sitting on the beach right in the water there, and you see everything. 
[00:44:00]  I mean everything.  And she's sporting what Jimmy loves.  Yeah.  Let's just say...  I mean, we're all fans of that area, but in particular, Jimmy likes when it looks like  that.  It's massive.  If that makes sense.  It really is.  Picture Cornelius wearing bikini bottoms over his face.  It's amazing.  She looks like she...  When you do this, like Shadow Puppet, what is this?  When you do this one, you try to make it look like a duck?  Like a little duck mouth. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Opening and close.  That's what it looks like in her bathing suit.  Yeah.  John Mayer's a lucky bastard, man.  If that is what it looks like it is...  Geez.  Yeah, they're not sure.  They're trying to figure out if this is a real picture or not.  If it is, wow.  I hope not.  It will just depress me and make me want to matter.  That is a solid one.  Oh, dude.  It's fantastic.  That is.  You can wear it as a hat.  Wow, is that sexy.  You might lose half your face.  Well, worth it. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Let's get back to the phones.  We're talking about kidney transplants.  Yeah.  It's a big story today in New York.  Some dude wants his kidney back that he gave his wife because they're going through a  divorce.  Because she was screwing around on him.  Yeah.  What a jerk she was, huh?  Oh, wow.  Let's say hi to 13-year-old JC.  I'm on the air.  Hey, boys.  Wait a minute.  Who...  He's conducting business.  He's like, ah, I'm on the air.  Yeah.  Who are you saying I'm on the air to?  Your mom?  No, to my dad because I need him to turn down the radio.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  You guys work together, huh? 
[00:45:30]  My bad.  Yeah.  So what do you got, JC?  I'm wondering, Ant, would you give me a kidney?  Oh, that's a good question.  Oh.  Why would I give you...  Well, oh, it's because he's young and like, you know, sacrifice for the little youngster.  Uh-huh.  No.  I'm going to be dying instead of your alcoholism.  As long as you don't need my liver, right?  JC rules.  By the way, JC, for now on, I don't care when your birthday is.  You're going to always be 13-year-old JC. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Works for me.  All right, man.  Have fun at school today.  What's the big plan today?  Oh, we have this stupid Indian dude who has elephants paint these paintings that look like  abstract fat woman pictures.  It was just horrible.  So doing a speech about how it inspired him in the inside.  So I'll be studying for my math class during that.  Yeah.  He knows what's important.  Wait till I show you the painting I got there, JC. 
[00:46:30]  It might inspire you.  Looks like it came out of the other end of the elephant.  Ah.  All right, man.  Have fun at school.  Say hi to dad.  All right.  See you later, guys.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to Randy in Ohio.  If I have to deal with one more of the – sorry, Randy.  Two seconds.  If I have to deal with one more of them, though, if that kid comes up to me in years  to come, you know who I am?  Uh-huh.  Remember me?  Uh-huh.  I was 13 when I used to call the show.  Oh, no.  What? 
[00:47:00]  We got 30-year-olds that hang out at the other place.  Yeah.  I started listening to you guys when you were at AAF.  I was 16 years old.  I get –  I'm now married with five kids.  What?  Things on – like things on MySpace and stuff where people are just like, hey, I used to  listen to you guys when you were in Boston.  I was 11 and –  Yeah.  And I'm in college and I just graduated.  Just like, oh, God.  It's a bit weird.  Randy, how are you, buddy?  Doing well, man. 
[00:47:30]  Good.  What do you got?  Well, my mother wanted a kidney, needs a kidney, and my sister and I are both perfect  matches, and giving her a kidney would be like giving Mickey Mantle or Anthony our liver.  So what's funny is she's out trying to take me to court because my sister said that she  would do it, but then I went and talked to my sister because my mom is an alcoholic,  but they say the alcoholic has just speeded up the process, that she's got some kind of 
[00:48:00]  disease.  So I talked to my sister and she has kids and I have kids.  I said, well, if my mom's got the disease, there's a chance that we might have it or  our kids, you know, they might need the kidney one day and she's not going to straighten  up.  She's not going to change.  So my mom – go ahead.  Yeah.  You're just trying to justify the fact that you don't want to give her a kidney.  Yeah.  I think I'm kind of with you.  She's an alcoholic and you've got kids of your own.  I don't think that's a tough call.  I think I would pass on that one.  Well, she's tried to take me to court because I talked my sister out of it and since I'm 
[00:48:30]  an organ donor on my driver's license, she said, well, I should be doing that anyway.  It's really funny around Christmas time because, you know, like, you know, pass a turkey, give  me your kidney.  Right.  Yeah.  So that's where we stand.  So I wouldn't do it.  I would give my sister or her kids or my kids, yeah, any day.  Right now.  Well, kids, the people and your goddamn kids, you sacrifice everything for them.  Oh, yeah.  What do they wind up doing?  Your mom sacrificed a lot for you. 
[00:49:00]  She didn't do crap.  She did a lot for you.  Yeah.  She was just doing what she had to do, not what she wanted to do.  Are you kidding?  She wanted to be out partying all the time.  She was.  My brother was our babysitter at seven years old, I think.  All right, Joe, watch the kids.  Yeah.  Why do you hate kids so much?  They're inconvenient, annoying, disgusting.  A lot of people would agree.  Life wreckers, body wreckers, relationship wreckers, romance wreckers, sex wreckers. 
[00:49:30]  But why do you hate them?  Does it go back to when you were being brought up?  No, no, it really doesn't go back to that.  It goes back to the fact that I look at people that have kids and the only thing they can say,  the only positive thing they can say is, you know, once you have them, you just realize how much you just,  there's a certain part of you, this love that comes out.  Never one thing like, ah, you know, I could send them around and make them wash my car. 
[00:50:00]  That, to me, is more viable than this new love that I found in myself for a child that it's my,  there's this thing, this feeling you get that you just don't, ah, you get an extra pair of hands around the house once they get old enough.  But first, when they're babies, they're useless.  But first, you've got to understand love.  Do you understand love?  I understand love.  I gave it a shot a few times.  But kids?  No. 
[00:50:30]  Love between a guy and a girl in love is a different thing than this love between a parent and child.  The love between a parent and child is this obligation.  It's this obligated love that you have because you made something.  Let me ask you something.  You made a pet.  You made a pet that has an opposable thumb and a brain.  Were you, ah, now that some time has passed, were you ever in love with, like, your ex-wife or the long, the long, the long, the long relationship? 
[00:51:00]  The ex-wife?  Never.  Never.  The long relationship?  Sure.  Okay.  But the, ah, the ex-wife?  No.  Well, with the ex-wife?  Never in love.  You have said on the show, so it's safe to say, that you guys were close to maybe trying to have a kid.  But you didn't agree with having kids.  So what was going on in your head?  That was during the Anthony, I'll do anything to stop the conflict phase of Anthony.  And you thought that would stop the conflict?  That Anthony, by the way, is dead and buried. 
[00:51:30]  No kidding.  Dead and buried.  Now it's conflict, conflict, conflict if I feel I need to conflict.  It's the Opie and Gaza show.  Yes, exactly.  Don't lob any missiles at me.  But that wouldn't have solved the conflict.  No.  It would have made it way worse.  Well, that's why.  No, you wouldn't have a kid.  Then there'd be some, like, you know.  That's why I would go, like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and not be done. 
[00:52:00]  But wouldn't she figure it out later that you were faking?  Oh, hell yeah.  With the ex?  I didn't want her pregnant.  What are you kidding?  You were pretending?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I guess you could say pretending to try to make one.  Make her pregnant.  He was standing outside of a fire just pointing a hose yelling, whoosh.  Exactly.  There you go.  You're summarizing that one.  You ain't going to catch me.  So then, all right.  Because that was close to the end anyway.  But let me go with that. 
[00:52:30]  So now she assumes the act is over.  Yeah.  But you still, you still have to get rid of the poison.  I've got to get up and go to the bathroom.  And then you would.  I'll be right back.  And then you'd.  I'll go and think of someone else.  Yeah.  And then you would try to get the toilet pregnant.  Yes.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  The trap on that toilet must have looked like the Jell-O pudding vanilla factory. 
[00:53:00]  Clayton from.  I didn't want a kid.  I didn't want one.  I just saw guys having kids.  And it would just.  But that's how.  That's why you got married.  Because you saw everyone else getting married.  And you felt like, well, I got to get married, I guess.  Yeah.  To be an adult.  Hmm.  And then the kid thing was not my idea.  We had like this plan.  This like long range plan.  It was like, all right, get married.  After like three years of marriage.  That's like, all right. 
[00:53:30]  We could have fun for three years.  And then we'll work on kids.  But then I started getting into radio.  And then I was like, you know, I got this career just coming up.  I can't be doing this.  We're going to have to alter the plan.  And boy, did I keep altering that plan.  You sure did, my friend.  Until there was a massive blowout.  And it was like, all right, it's time.  And then it was like, oh, no one's getting pregnant here.  What's the story?  Go to a fertility doctor and have everything checked out.  I, meanwhile, have like, oh, my cells look like the Nazis at Nuremberg. 
[00:54:00]  I have to interrupt, though, because you were doing what you just explained a few minutes ago.  So she's assuming that you guys are definitely trying.  But there's a problem.  And now all of a sudden at dinner or something, you've got to go, well, we've been trying for a while.  So I didn't say that.  I was like, oh, she's like, oh, something we might have to go, you know, check this out and see if there's a problem with one or the other. 
[00:54:30]  The guy looked under the microscope at mine, and they looked back at him with angry eyes.  I'm raring to go.  And the doctor looks at you.  He looks under the microscope, sees what really is going on, looks at you and gives you a wink like, all right, I've seen this one before.  Mine are all on, like, Nautilus machines.  Taking steroids.  They're rocking.  Oh, rocking.  Everything seemed to be in order. 
[00:55:00]  So it was just like, I don't know.  They're all trying to take on Michael Phelps.  They're just having swimming competitions.  Yeah.  And then they're like, oh, maybe, you know, you need some kind of vitamins.  Really?  They said.  So there was this whole vitamin thing.  Did you go with the vitamins?  I'll go with anything.  I know what the real story was.  Yep.  Sock full of tapioca.  Exactly.  You are classic, man.  I didn't want any kids.  All these years, I never knew.  Well, I sort of knew a little of this, but I didn't realize to what extent. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Did she ever get checked out?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they saw that she was all right?  Yep.  Everything should have been hunky-dory.  How long did you do that for?  Oh, it was quite a while.  More than six months?  Yeah.  About that.  And then it got to the point where it was just kind of, you know, things were meh.  Dude, she had to know, though, because, I mean, you know, when you do that with a...  Yeah, yeah, there's kind of a...  Afterwards, you kind of know that...  A byproduct or something, but... 
[00:56:00]  Yes.  I would just make it seem like, you know, I would...  I don't even know how to put this, and I'm pretty good at doing this, but I would make  it seem like it was inaccessible for her.  Like, I would...  I would make it seem like that should have been in her chest somewhere.  Like, you're really not going to find much.  You'd get the impression that you had opened the warehouse door and just lobbed that ping-pong 
[00:56:30]  way into the back of the warehouse.  Way in the back of the warehouse.  She bought that?  Hey, whatever.  She had to know.  Why would anyone fake?  She's probably in denial, too.  She had to know.  Come on.  I don't know.  Come on.  Doesn't matter to me now.  And you can't move, though.  After you fake, what happens is you kind of have to stay put for a little while.  See, Jimmy knows.  Of course.  Right.  I've stayed the other way.  I didn't do nothing. 
[00:57:00]  That's all we do.  All right, running down the phones because we don't have time.  Clayton in Ohio.  I agree with Ant, and I have a kid.  Dave from New York is the typical fell asleep next to the bean pod in Invasion of the Body  Snatchers guy.  Let's go to Dave.  Ant, Dave.  How are you guys?  Good morning.  Good morning, Dave.  Ant, I just want to comment.  I mean, when I was younger, I was wild and enjoyed myself as much as anybody.  I used to go out on Friday nights to clubs and not go straight to work on Monday morning. 
[00:57:30]  But I have two little boys in my own.  Now, let me tell you, it's that coming home, I drive a truck for a living, and I deal with  a bunch of idiots all day in New York.  And I could have the most miserable day, but when I come home and open that door, my 19-month-old  comes running over to me with his arms open.  It is the greatest feeling in the world.  It just washes everything away.  Well...  It really does.  Good for you.  I'm very happy for you and everything, and good for you, but are you happy for people  that have kids and they seem very happy?  No, because their kids annoy me. 
[00:58:00]  I understand.  Other people's kids annoy me, too.  But when it comes to your brother's kids or your sister's kids, it's a whole different  thing.  Oh, they're fine because they're like little babies and stuff, but they'll annoy me at some  point.  They'll annoy me.  Yeah, but you don't have to live with them, though.  There's times that I wish that they can't be annoying.  There's times that I say to myself, boy, I wish I could send these kids home at the end  of the day.  But all the way, when it's all said and done, I look mad at it.  These kids actually saved my life.  Because if I was still living the life that I was living, I'd be dead. 
[00:58:30]  Well, I'd be talking to people like that.  Yeah.  You never know.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Chris C. from Virginia.  Thank you, Chris C.  He writes, Michael Phelps.  Glad to see you've updated your sperm metaphors, Opie.  Because we've talked about this over the years, and I always go with Mark Spitz.  Mark Spitz.  Well, thank you.  I'm glad Chris C. is paying attention out there.  You've got to update these things.  Or you sound like the old dude on the radio.  You know, the old dude that talks about 1970s football. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Lee Lee.  Exactly.  Well, here's this annoying bitch.  Lydia.  Oceanside.  Yes, she's going to.  More psychobabble.  Analyze me.  Go ahead, Lydia.  Go ahead, Freud.  Morning, boys.  Hello.  Hi, Lydia.  Anthony, it seems to me that you've spent most of your adult life trying not to be that  crying boy in the back of the car.  Having children would just bring you so much closer to that. 
[00:59:30]  I understand why you don't want children.  It must be very, very frightening.  Frightening?  This is why I will never go to a therapist.  I would sit there and she would go frightening.  If she sat there and talked to me like this, I'd be like, ugh.  Why are you so frightened?  And then I'd have to, like, eventually I'd have to go, I'm frightened.  You're right, Dr. Lydia.  I'm so frightened.  No. 
[01:00:00]  And then she would have to say something like, well, it looks like we had a breakthrough today.  This is good.  This is good.  You're letting it all out.  I am scared of having children.  No.  That's exactly what I would say.  And then I would say, okay, our time is up.  See you next week.  Yeah.  Bend you over the desk.  And in the back of your head, you're going, ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.  Another sucker.  Ka-ching, ka-ching.  Oh, never.  Never.  Ka-ching.  In the back of my head, I would be thinking, how sad. 
[01:00:30]  I don't think he's scared of having kids.  I think he just doesn't want them.  I'm scared.  I think that it's like there's a stress, this emphasis put on having children, like there's  something wrong with you if you don't want them.  They wreck things.  He doesn't want them.  Ant is not crazy about kids.  I'm sure he's nice to his nieces and nephews, but he doesn't want them.  Of course.  What's weird about that?  Good for you.  I don't either.  And he shouldn't have them.  If you don't want children, you shouldn't have them.  But you guys were wondering why he hates them. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Because children are vulnerable, and Anthony has spent his whole life trying not to be vulnerable  again.  Everything's psychological.  What does venerable mean, though?  Venerable.  You mean vulnerable?  Vulnerable means weak and open to other people.  Oh, I was wondering where the L went.  Yeah.  But do you think that he's fearful of being vulnerable?  Venerable.  Idiot. 
[01:01:30]  Yes, I do.  I think he's fearful of being vulnerable.  Why can't somebody just be skipping through life, enjoying themselves, and knowing that  children would completely change that, and I wouldn't be having fun?  Yeah.  I have no problem with that.  Why, if I want to grab somebody and wing on down to the Bahamas and stay in Atlantis for  a week straight and not have to worry about a kid, why can't it just be that I enjoy that 
[01:02:00]  compared to toting around baby stuff everywhere you go?  Well, why can't it just be that?  Why has it always got to be some fear or venerability?  And I'm with you to that point.  Well, I have the problem with it, but you don't think people could be happy after they  have kids, though?  No, no, I think they can, but I think they'll, they always look back at the time before kids 
[01:02:30]  and, not always, but a majority of the time, look back before they had kids, and that's  when they had their real fun.  Okay.  And you have to write that off because now your whole life, and I'm talking about relationships  too, because I know there are guys out there, and there's exceptions to the rule, don't get  me wrong, I'm not saying everybody, but there are so many women that become mothers, and 
[01:03:00]  they're no longer wives or girlfriends.  They are moms.  You're now living with your own mother or some crap like that, because she's totally dedicated  to the kids, and you are now way down on the old totem pole as far as pleasure goes.  And I don't need that crap.  It's certainly hard, and you want to be the center of the tension.  It is!  I'm special!  That's what children do, Anthony.  They want to be the center of the tension. 
[01:03:30]  That's what I am, then.  I'm a big child.  Wah, wah, wah.  Hold on.  Shut up, shut up.  I hate you.  Well, we got John in Buffalo on with Lydia in Oceanside.  John, what do you got to add to this conversation?  Well, I just looked up narcissistic personalities, sort of, because I think Anthony has it, and  I just want, there's nine criteria, and if a person has five or more, they're thought  to have it.  And I wanted to ask Opie and Jimmy if these fit Anthony, if they know him.  All right.  Let's hear some of these.  Okay.  See if I'm a narcissist.  Number one.  Shut up, Lydia! 
[01:04:00]  No, hold on.  Lydia, what?  I'm just kidding.  Hey, why don't you get that woman off?  She sucks.  I know.  Well, are you, hold on, are you one of these psycho guys, too?  Oh, no, I just looked up narcissists, because I think Anthony's a narcissist now.  I want to take the test.  Let's take the test there.  And be, like, legit here.  All right.  Number one.  Has a grandiose sense of self-importance.  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  I'll answer him, honestly.  Two is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. 
[01:04:30]  Absolutely.  Okay.  Three, believes that he or she is special and unique.  Yep.  I'm being completely honest.  This test, by the way, dude, is not convincing me of anything.  But go ahead.  Four.  Four, requires excessive admiration.  Yep.  Five, has a sense of entitlement.  Certainly.  Six, is interpersonally exploitive.  Wait a minute, what? 
[01:05:00]  What's that mean?  That's not true.  Shut up, Lydia!  It doesn't mean it's not a narcissist.  Lydia, what's that mean, interpersonally exploitive?  It means you use other people for your benefit without any thought about their feeling as individual human beings.  Okay, that's something I'll say no at, because I don't do that all the time.  That's good to hear.  I do it with people I don't like, but...  Now, seven's a no-brainer.  It's what we're talking about now.  Lacks empathy.  No, I don't lack empathy. 
[01:05:30]  I think I'm very empathetic to certain people and their plights.  Well, yeah, don't you think that saying anybody who has kids is miserable is saying that basically a large percentage of the human race is miserable?  Anthony's not a narcissistic personality disorder.  He doesn't empathize with people who have children, but it doesn't mean that he doesn't have empathy.  He just thinks that people who have kids should all be kind of lined up and shot.  I mean, that's Anthony's odd view, but that doesn't make him a narcissist. 
[01:06:00]  Let's roll through the rest of them.  What are they?  Eight, is often envious of others or believes others are envious of him or her.  All right, I'll give you that one, marginal, sometimes.  Eight, shows, or nine, this is the final one, so I guess you've already qualified.  Shows arrogant, hardy behaviors or attitudes.  Yeah, okay, I could be arrogant.  Wow.  All right, so...  That's such a vague test, though, bro, that everyone, especially with thoughts of success and all that, 
[01:06:30]  like everyone fantasizes about being better at what they do or making more money.  But I am!  Of course you are.  I was only talking about you.  All right, touch it up.  All right, thank you, John.  The truth is right.  It has to be above and beyond what a normal person would do.  I'm entitled.  Above and beyond the normal fantasies of success and everything.  Right, Anthony's not a narcissistic personality disorder.  He's more of a sociopath.  Yeah.  A little narcissism. 
[01:07:00]  All right, Lydia.  A hurt little boy.  We're done with you.  Do not send us a bill.  I'm a hurt little boy.  I don't disagree with Lydia.  I could be a hurt little boy.  Anybody in any type of show business is our hurt little boys or girls.  That's what we all are.  That's what makes us pursue this crap.  Have a wonderful day, guys.  And you have a wonderful day, too.  You do this fine.  Thank you.  Hey, Lydia.  Yes.  We got to take a break. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, we got to go, Lydia.  He's going nuts.  Get lost.  His hair's falling out.  He's going crazy.  He's falling.  It's leaping off his forehead with parachutes.  Speaking of which, in about 10 seconds, we get to hear what Stunt Brain's going to do for his horrendous hair loss.  Stay there, Opie and Anthony.  I know we're moving on.  We were talking about transplants, but people are asking still.  So my friend from college, going back a little bit here, my fellow fraternity brother, a good friend of mine. 
[01:08:00]  We've lost touch over the years, unfortunately.  He lives far away.  He's got a family and kids, and I'm down here.  But see, why can't he just come down and visit you?  Oh, that's right.  He's got kids.  No, he actually does a pretty good job for someone that has kids.  He still lives his life.  But his young wife, at the time, because now this goes back a few years, had some ridiculous rare disease that was pretty much shutting down her heart and her lungs. 
[01:08:30]  Yikes.  Extremely rare disease.  So she was on the donor list, and they were on standby where they were going to get the call at any moment for her to get a new heart and new lungs.  That's amazing.  And she was, I don't even think she was 30.  Just amazing.  She didn't do that.  So time went by, a few false calls, and false calls?  What am I saying?  False alarms.  False alarms.  Thank you. 
[01:09:00]  And they finally got the call.  They had the jet waiting and everything.  I don't want to really say where he's from.  And they got her into this hospital.  She got a new heart and two new lungs and a mere, less than a month later, they're down here in New York City, and I go out to dinner with them around the Christmas holiday.  Wow.  And she's smoking and drinking. 
[01:09:30]  And I'm sitting there, and I've got to be honest, and he's a good friend of mine, but I was completely creeped out.  Very happy for him.  Extremely happy for him.  Yeah.  But creeped out, because I'm sitting there, and I can't get past the fact that she is living, because she's got someone else's heart and lungs.  Kidney.  When you hear someone has a kidney or something, it doesn't freak me out as much.  But I'm sitting there, like, I hear her breathing, because she's still getting used to her new lungs.  So you hear kind of, you know, her...  Whoa. 
[01:10:00]  I can't really do the noise, but she's...  Man is playing God.  Right.  And she's kind of breathing with someone else's lungs, and she's still learning how to use her new lungs.  And I'm sitting there, like, wow.  Wow.  That's something.  Wow.  And she had a grand old time.  She was getting around.  She ate a fine meal.  She wasn't boozing or anything.  No, huh?  And then they went back to their hotel, and I'm just...  I was just stupefied.  I was like, this is just unbelievable.  Can you imagine?  No, and I don't want to.  Huh?  No, I don't know. 
[01:10:30]  No, and I don't want to.  No, I don't want to imagine that ever.  Today's an interesting day in history.  Is it?  Why, Jimmy?  Why?  It was 51 years ago today, apparently, that a young 14-year-old Bobby Fischer won the U.S. championship.  That kook.  From Samuel Rushevsky.  How long ago?  51 years ago, he was 14, and he won the U.S. championship.  How long ago?  I don't know how this makes sense, because I think he was 66 when he died, 
[01:11:00]  and he died, like, last year, but 51 plus 14 equals 65, so I don't know how that works.  Might be off a year or two.  I was thinking of the Spassky.  No, that was, I believe, 72.  Yeah, okay, that's what I remember then, because I'm like, wait a minute, I don't remember that.  I wasn't born then.  Jesus.  No, he beat Samuel Rushevsky.  Ah, Rushevsky.  Let me tell you, a kook.  We've played his audio over the years, man.  He, oof.  He loves the Jews. 
[01:11:30]  No, he really doesn't.  Oh, literal.  Jim.  Oh, boy.  He certainly doesn't love the Jews.  My favorite Fischer moment was when he spit on the U.S. State Department order that he not  placed Spassky in a rematch in 92 in Yugoslavia.  He spit on the government papers.  Hey, Ann, were you in Fort Lauderdale yesterday?  Yeah, as a matter of fact.  You were?  Yep.  And you flew back in time for the show?  Yeah, yeah.  I left after the show.  Who is saying that I was in Fort Lauderdale?  Just asking. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, okay.  Because speaking of Jews, you've got this little story coming out of Fort Lauderdale.  All right.  Go look for another land to steal.  Go steal other land.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go back to the oven.  Go back.  You need a big oven.  That's what you need.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Love is alive and well in Fort Lauderdale.  Let that be.  Wow.  A white, anti-black protest.  And you watch the way the mainstream media covers it. 
[01:12:30]  And that gets a little bit of play.  Yeah.  And it's in the papers.  Mm-hmm.  But it is getting nowhere near the coverage that that would get if it was a bunch of other  people not trash.  If it wasn't Muslims.  Yeah.  Being nasty and trashy Jews, they would be covering that completely.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's protesters at an anti-Israel demonstration in Fort Lauderdale telling the Jews to go back  into the oven.  Yeah.  There you go.  Get a big oven, she's saying.  There you go.  Yeah.  There you go.  Holy mother of God. 
[01:13:00]  This reinforces my whole thing in that when you hate somebody, you will just pull out  all the stops when it comes to insulting them or throwing out some type of thing that you  want to hurt them with.  All bets are off.  Yeah.  We've all been in that place.  And that's why.  At least once in our life.  That's why I call shenanigans on anyone that says they've never used this racial slur or  this sexist slur or something.  Because when push comes to shove and you have to insult somebody and you're severely angry, 
[01:13:30]  you're going to pull it out.  You're at least going to think it.  Uh-huh.  I like the people that go, no, it's never even crossed my mind.  You're a liar.  I think so.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there are other people that just think it all the time.  Yeah.  Well, we're talking about the news.  Then we've got this crazy news story right here.  This is crazy.  You thought that last one was bad.  Listen to this. 
[01:14:00]  And again, this week, Alex, I can show you the massive snow piles that have resulted.  This is what...  Ow!  Jeez.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, man.  You all right, pal?  No, you're not.  Wow.  Wow.  Okay, we're going to cut away from that, and I hope you're...  Okay, my goodness.  Ow!  Jeez.  Oh, gosh.  Ah!  What an ass.  Yeah.  Good for him.  He fell into the snow?  Yeah.  We'll link the video on onaradio.com. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, oh, you all right?  Oh!  We're going to cut away.  Why do you always have to cut away?  Stay there.  We want to see it.  Yeah, who's leaving?  Your dumb show.  That's what you're doing.  You're doing things to keep people watching.  Yeah.  Why would you then cut away?  Yeah, come on.  Oh, is that great.  Somebody other than a reporter, you can bet the media would have stayed on it.  Yeah, we're watching the video now.  We'll have this linked.  He's walking.  He kind of...  Wow, does he tumble down that little hill.  What a clumsy douche.  What's that, Danny?  I didn't see the video itself, so I was looking for it. 
[01:15:00]  This apparently is a completely different...  Oh, really?  Oh, all right.  Well, we might have to get that.  Hopefully, the one we just heard actually was doing a story on cow patties.  And steps on a giant pile of...  Want to hear that again?  Yep.  All right.  And again, this week, Alex, I can show you the massive snow piles that have resulted.  This is what...  Ow!  Jeez.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, man. 
[01:15:30]  You all right, pal?  No, you're not.  Like Carol Brady.  Wow.  Mike!  Okay, we're going to cut away from that.  Are you okay?  Okay, my goodness.  Apparently not.  You weighed 10 pounds.  You sneezed and four teeth fell out.  She did when she said, Mike!  Yeah.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  Where are the boys?  And why are you wearing Mike-looking lens underpants on your face?  I got to see that video. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, we'll get that up on onaradio.com.  Good one.  We got Ann Coulter calling in a few minutes here.  About a half hour.  Half hour?  Yeah.  Her new book is what?  Guilty?  Liberal Victims and Their Assault on America.  Yeah.  Oh, she gives the liberals a beating in every book.  They hate her so much.  Oh, they can't stand her.  I love the fact they hate her.  She is like the picture of the people that liberals hate. 
[01:16:30]  Amazing.  They love to be the snarky ones or the ones who just, she just attacks them without apology.  And they're so covert in their attacks half the time, you know, because they like to pretend  there's something they're not.  And this is not even about your politics.  This is simply about certain liberal arrogance.  I love the fact that she just basically verbally spits in their face.  Yeah, she's got no apologies.  None.  She just, if people try to call her out. 
[01:17:00]  There's so many people out there that voice their opinions and ideas or politics, and  they catch some flack from some liberal ass, and then they turn around and apologize or  try to spin what they said and go, no, I didn't mean that.  What I was really saying, she just turns around and goes, yeah, that's what I said.  And?  I think when she called John Edwards a faggot, she said that, and that was a tremendous  story.  Oh, yeah.  And I think that they were demanding, and they said to him an apology, and she goes, 
[01:17:30]  well, I couldn't apologize because I was too busy laughing.  Yeah.  Good.  Don't apologize.  Yeah.  Right on the bestseller.  Must be nice not to have to answer to anybody.  That's what it comes down to.  Yep.  Well, she was, I guess, her and Matt Lauer were just yelling over each other yesterday  or something.  Oh, yeah.  We got a clip here.  So we canceled your appearance here on Tuesday, and from what I've been reading, you thought  you were banned for life from the show.  Were you behind that report?  Um, no, I didn't say that.  That was from a reliable news report that, by the way, had never, has never had to retract 
[01:18:00]  a report on exploding GM trucks.  Um, but I do note that's, uh, like NBC.  Um.  So we're either dead or you weren't banned.  It apparently took, it apparently took eight hours for the Today Show to remember that there  was a Wednesday show that I could be invited back to.  It took the Drudge Report posting that for the Wednesday invitation to appear.  But I'm very happy to be here.  You said, oh, we've had you on so many times in the past after every book, you've always  been invited back.  Why would you all of a sudden be banned?  Why would you, I don't know. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, that's not for me to answer what your motives are.  We traded you out for Tony Blair yesterday.  And I think that's a pretty good switch.  Well, yeah, more than Tony Blair on for four hours.  Yeah, right.  But you were, in your slot where you were supposed to be yesterday morning was Tony Blair.  Um, and Rachel Maddow and various gossip columnists and a bear.  The point is I was canceled twice and it wasn't until the Drudge Report ran a headline on its  own reporting and the Drudge Report has never had to retract a report.  You know, you know what, you know what that expression is?  Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean you don't have enemies. 
[01:19:00]  But anyway.  Well, Matt Lauer can't hold his own, huh?  She just smashed him.  She's a pit bull.  Even if she's, even if they didn't ban her for life, and if he's like, why would they  all of a sudden ban you now?  I don't know.  Maybe because of the fact that you blast the media's treatment of Obama, you directly attack.  Maybe that's why they would ban her.  Good for her, man.  Oh, did she smash him?  My favorite part of that was when she described, it's not just Tony Blair, it was this one, 
[01:19:30]  this one, and a bear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You couldn't fit me in because you got a bear story.  And then she should have took that eight hours to realize they had a Wednesday show  they could put on.  Wow.  Good for you.  She's brutal.  Yeah.  So we'll have her on in about a half hour.  Yeah.  And then from page one of the papers here in New York, people are talking about the fact  that Obama had lunch with all the ex-presidents.  The ex-presidents.  One of these things don't. 
[01:20:00]  It's not like the other.  Because one of these things is not the same.  My dumb observation on this is, wow, it's so weird to see that there's only four ex-presidents  and one is actually still in office.  Yeah.  That is weird to me.  You would think.  No, I know.  It's never more than what?  Like four to six?  Yeah.  Look at that.  It kind of tells you about the job.  I know you go into the job later in life usually.  Yep.  But it's really, that's it. 
[01:20:30]  You only got four of them.  You only got four and one's still in office.  So technically you got three ex-presidents right there.  That's it.  And I noticed that Carter is the next to go because in this picture he's kind of off  to the side a little bit.  Well, he's trying to be, like Jimmy said, as far away from the Bush family as is humanly  possible and still be in the picture.  I like Jimmy Carter, even though I don't agree with almost anything he says, but I  like the fact that he just doesn't care what, he just says whatever he wants and that's  the end of it.  Well, there was some kind of ex-president protocol that you're not supposed to bash a seated 
[01:21:00]  president if you're an ex-president.  It's just never been done.  And he got up there and just bashed George W.  Oh, yeah.  And caught a lot of flack for it.  But, yeah, that is the kind of guy he always was.  Yeah.  Straight shooter.  But only having four.  But I think we're going to start collecting ex-presidents now because Clinton's 62.  He'll be around for a while.  Bush is 62.  And not a hint of a human emotion, by the way. 
[01:21:30]  Everyone else has a smile or some kind of look on their face in this picture.  Would you smile if the entire country hated you?  Yeah.  But he's always looked like this.  He never showed a hint of having any kind of emotion.  I don't know.  Like real human emotion.  Sometimes they have that little smirk and a wink.  Right.  Get the little wink and the smirk.  Yeah.  Now he's just like, get me out of this job.  He's crossing days off on a calendar somewhere.  One more.  One more.  Get the other guy in here.  How much longer now?  12 days.  12 days. 
[01:22:00]  12 days and he's done.  That's it?  Yeah.  That's it, man.  It's over.  So he's 62 and then Carter is 84, huh?  84.  And Bush's father is 84, too.  Yeah.  Wow.  But I think we'll start collecting the ex-presidents and this picture will be a lot bigger in the coming years.  Well, there was a cool one a few years ago.  It was in a presidential library.  It was a really cool shot.  It was all the living ones.  It was Clinton, George Sr., Reagan, Nixon, and Carter.  And Ford. 
[01:22:30]  Ford.  So six of them.  Eisenhower?  No.  No.  No.  I know.  Roosevelt.  Taft.  Rutherford B. Hayes.  I hate when people say Roosevelt instead of Roosevelt.  Roosevelt.  Clever Roosevelt.  We have to ask Ann Coulter about the widows of the 9-11 tragedy.  They asked her on some show.  She's like, okay, that was three books ago.  And she just.  Yeah.  I know. 
[01:23:00]  But these guys are obsessed with the fact that she said that they were money-hungry attention  for her.  I think what.  We could ask her about it.  But I think that her.  She was basically.  Here's what she said.  The book was called Godless.  She was in a controversy because she described the widows by saying that these broads are  millionaires, lionized on TV and in articles about them, reveling in their status as celebrities  and stalked by grieferazis.  These self-obsessed women seemed genuinely unaware that 9-11 was an attack on our nation 
[01:23:30]  and acted as if the terrorist attacks happened only to them.  I've never seen people enjoying their husbands' deaths so much.  That was a very rough quote.  But, I mean, like when I first heard that, I didn't like her for it.  And it's like, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way.  I certainly like her now.  She's on right after the break.  Not at 8.30.  So, we've got to step aside.  And when we come back, we should have Ann Coulter on the phone with us today.  But first, a primetime gossip with Sam Roberts. 
[01:24:00]  We're back, and primetime gossip is ushering in the new year with some late-breaking news  coming from the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Recently on the show, Anthony began discussing how he was sleeping, but revealed more about  himself than he initially intended.  You know, I'm a big advocate of the TV being left on when I sleep.  So, you're not alone with your thoughts.  Yes, I don't like being alone with my thoughts.  Yeah.  Because they just kind of fester in my head.  Try as he might, those thoughts, they are a-festering. 
[01:24:30]  Making Anthony's sleep pattern quite irregular, to say the least.  I'm up now at night going, like I woke up at 2 in the morning, and I'm just going,  go back to sleep, go back to sleep.  As Ant's sleep has decreased, so has his grip on reality.  I walk around my house sometimes, and I find myself just talking to myself.  Yeah.  And then I say, hey, stop talking to yourself.  But I say it out loud.  All these symptoms lead us to believe that Anthony is developing an acute case of schizophrenia, 
[01:25:00]  which is usually brought on by prolonged periods of solitude.  I wake up to silence, and the voice is in my head.  Will Ant's psychosis degenerate further?  How soon will it be before Anthony is found nude, living in a closet with three-foot fingernails?  While we can't confirm anything, our analysts give him four days.  Stay tuned as PTG keeps you in the know.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  Good morning to everybody.  Jimmy, we got Ann Coulter on the phone. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  Our new book is called Guilty.  Ann?  Hello.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  First time.  Very cool.  I'm so happy to be here, but I can't believe you guys get up this early every morning.  Thanks.  We're not happy about it.  Hey, Jimmy was saying that he saw you at the cellar recently, and you could have been nicer  to everybody.  Yeah, it's Jim Norton, Ann.  Hello, Jim Norton.  You are hilarious.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, boo.  I'm on July all the time.  We have to be on together.  Yeah, I know.  I'm actually doing it tonight. 
[01:26:00]  We had Gutfeld come in like two weeks ago.  He's great.  He's just like an informed kind of weird guy.  He's a really fun dude to hang with.  Yeah.  Who?  Greg Gutfeld.  Oh, yeah.  I love him.  Hey, you, by the way, nice job.  We just heard your Matt Lauer.  Lambasting.  Boy, did you give him just a solid beating with the facts.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I must say, after the Drudge Report got resolved, Matt Lauer is now my favorite person in the  mainstream media. 
[01:26:30]  I have nothing but love for him.  What exactly do you think happened?  Like, I mean, I think the suit that NBC had a little meeting after that Drudge Report went  Yeah.  And the Drudge Report claiming that you were banned for life from NBC.  Yeah.  That was quite a catchy headline.  Um, I didn't, um, the, this is the problem with, with my getting up early.  I am, I am a night person and I'm usually writing until four or five in the morning.  So this is a very weird schedule for me the last few days.  Um, and if my synapses had been firing a little faster, I realized later, you know, Matt said 
[01:27:00]  I was, I was, I was canceled to make room for Tony Blair, but their press release the  night before, um, after the Drudge Report had been up for a while, said it was to discuss  Gaza.  Right.  And people posted on the internet that they called into NBC after seeing the Drudge Report  asking why I wasn't on and they were told because NBC viewers don't want to see her.  Yeah, how did, how did they come up with that? 
[01:27:30]  And like, to say that you're banned from, uh, uh, because I read the Drudge Report, that  you're banned because of your political ideology is just preposterous for a news station.  Well, it's strange that an insider would admit it.  Um, not that I wouldn't, I wouldn't believe it, but, um, boy, God bless Matt Drudge, Drudge,  the Drudge Report gets results.  Yeah, because it's embarrassing to realize, uh, that they did that, and I did hear that  too, where the viewers aren't going to like that, because I guess they don't like some 
[01:28:00]  of the things you said about the media's coverage, uh, of Obama.  Well, that's what I am pointing out.  They said it was because I was mean to Obama.  Mean?  Yeah.  How about one person says one thing that is even, even, even considered mean about this  guy?  The media has done nothing but just treat this guy with kid gloves, walk on eggshells.  Yes.  Yes, well, that is actually what's in the book.  It's not that I'm, it's not that I'm so mean to Obama, although I suppose there are a few 
[01:28:30]  lines, um, but it's a lot meaner to the media for their idiotic questions to him.  I, I go through one, um, of, of Wolf Blitzer's first question to all of the primary candidates  in both the Republican and the Democratic primary campaigns at the, at the crucial, you know,  moment when, when it was heating up.  And for all of the Republicans, you know, Huckabee, Romney, um, I think McCain didn't  do an interview with Wolf Blitzer.  I couldn't find it on Nexus anyway.  And, and Hillary, because she was often treated as sort of an honorary Republican once she was 
[01:29:00]  taking on the golden boy, um, all of them got really tough questions about the economy  right out of the gate.  The first question, I just quoted the first question to each one of them.  Um, and as you can see in the book, they're all questions about, well, you know, gas prices  are this, and, and the economy is here, and unemployment, if you were president right  now, what would you do?  And for Obambi, it was, the Republicans are going to call you a tax, a high tax, tax and 
[01:29:30]  spend liberal.  Are you prepared for such an attack?  Oof.  That's your question?  Well, that Wolf Blitzer really gets to the bottom of things, doesn't he?  Yes.  Um, Obambi's answer, yes, I am, Wolf.  Why, why do you think people don't see that the media just canonized this guy?  They, they let him get away with anything.  Any hint of a scandal wasn't even, uh, looked at further than scratching the surface.  No, I know, and now suddenly, um, he's not even president yet, and we're starting, we're 
[01:30:00]  getting...  Oh, he's not?  You never know it.  I know.  We're already getting the wisps of the scandal, um, scandal-plagued, you know, political world  he came out of.  Yeah, all of his, uh, cronies.  Yeah, maybe, uh, you know, instead of parachuting reporters into Wasilla, Alaska, if they had  sent one to Chicago, some of this would have come out before the election.  Yeah.  And, and the media was so quick, uh, to, uh, uh, jump on, um, uh, what's her name? 
[01:30:30]  Sarah Palin.  Sarah Palin for her lack of experience.  Uh, and, and just barely scratched the surface about Obama and his lack of experience.  Right, right.  It was, it was a hate crime to mention Obama's lack of experience until Sarah Palin came along.  Um, and then, and then liberals just didn't even care that, that, that there was a double  standard here.  And it is, uh, you bring that up, it is so easy to just whip out that race card the 
[01:31:00]  second he's criticized on anything.  Right, right.  Which is, uh, uh, just disgusting, especially considering the fact that, you know, he's our  first half-white president.  Right.  No, and also, I mean, you know, going with the victimology theme, um, it is sort of a weird  thing that, that in America right now, today, the way you get ahead is, um, to, to claim  to be a victim. 
[01:31:30]  I mean, I'm mad in all other periods of history and all over the world, if people were lying  about themselves, they'd, they'd lie up.  They'd, they'd say they came from a better family, went to better schools, um, are better  than they are.  Now we all debase ourselves, and, or, well, not we all, but, um, people debase themselves,  claiming to be worse than they are, so that, because doors are open for you in America if  you're a victim.  And part of this comes from, um, the black experience in America.  They were true victims.  Americans felt guilty about it.  Um, but now you have every other group latching on to it. 
[01:32:00]  You know, privileged women living in Scarsdale.  Um, I'm a victim of my boredom.  Um, and you have, um, you know, illegal immigrants and gays, and every other group wants to latch  on to it.  Liberals have latched on to it, just distorting into this peculiar thing.  But given what the original and genuine victims that people did want to have some sort of  compensation for, or change the laws on, and so on and so forth, that was based on slavery 
[01:32:30]  having existed in America.  Barack Obama's father was not touched by the slavery experience in America.  He was from Africa.  But still, Obama gets to, he's entitled by the victim status of being an African.  Well, because he, uh, it's the whole culture of this country that, uh, he was raised in  that, uh, victimized him, even though his father wasn't, uh, uh, uh, his father was born  in Africa, uh, which is, it's a ridiculous, uh, argument. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  There is no racism in America anymore.  Please, can we move on?  I go through all of the hoax race crimes in, in chapter one.  And everyone wanting to be a victim.  I mean, the only surprise if a, a noose showed up on a college campus today would be if an  actual racist put it there.  There, it is amazing, too, how the media covers, uh, hate crimes, uh, in this country.  You will always see emblazoned on a front page a dopey white guy that decided he was going 
[01:33:30]  to beat the crap out of a black guy.  Uh, the stories on the daily news or the post cover for days on end about that.  Yet, um, on page 17, somewhere buried, will be how maybe three or four black guys, uh, decided  to, uh, take a couple that was out having a night, a white couple, and beat the crap  and rob them.  And that's just, you know, a robbery.  Right, right.  There's a very distinct victim narrative.  And if you don't fit into it, um, you won't get the news coverage. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  There's a certain elitism, it seems like, in the media where they almost think that,  that, uh, blacks are incapable, or any minority group is incapable of committing certain thought,  uh, like, hate crimes.  They just, they're reacting violently.  That's what they do.  When white people do it, they say there must be a different motive.  It must be hate.  It's a real elitism, uh, a real subtle elitism in the media.  And, uh, they really, I love the fact that they hate you so much.  There's a visceral reaction to you from them.  It's like, I don't know what it is. 
[01:34:30]  It's maybe because you're so unapologetic, and you don't, you don't hide the fact that  you're attacking them?  Yes, I've, I've been commenting that maybe I'll reconsider this, this hobby of mine of  writing books, attacking people I then expect to interview me.  Yeah.  It is a unique stance, though, because, um, uh, you could get a staunch Republican, conservative,  whatever, that'll speak their mind, say something, and then the first liberal that pops out of  the woodwork and demands an apology, uh, the person will turn around and say, well, I meant 
[01:35:00]  this.  Right.  I didn't mean this.  And you just come out and go, yeah, I said that, so.  Wasn't it funny?  Yeah.  I could laugh at that one.  And it's so refreshing because, uh, there are not many people that, that do that.  Everybody's so on the defensive now.  They don't want to be called racist, sexist, homophobic, whatever, and, and many of the  times, it's not that.  You can't comment on someone's fault, and I'll bring up Obama again, you can't comment 
[01:35:30]  on his faults, his inexperience, his mistakes, anything, without being labeled, well, you're  a racist.  Right.  No, that's right.  He who was offended first wins.  That's, that's the game in America.  Like a register operatic, uh, you know, rage at some perceived flight, and then everything  has to go your way.  Everyone else has to stop talking.  This is why you have this weird phenomenon of everyone playing victim.  I also went through in chapter one, um, because I, I do the whole, you know, whole flue of, 
[01:36:00]  of this weirdness of everybody wanting to be a victim.  Um, in the publishing industry, we have all these hoax memoirs, um, of people claiming to  have been victims of things they are not victims of at all.  Oh, the Holocaust one.  We got a couple of Holocaust, but written by Gentiles, who were safely ensconced, you  know, far away from Nazis.  We got the Jewish gal from the Valley, who was claiming she was raised in a foster home  by a black single mother in South Central L.A. and was running drugs for the crypt. 
[01:36:30]  Um, writes, writes a memoir about it, and then her sister sees her picture in the New York  Times Review and calls into the publisher and says, um, my, my sister grew up in, in a nice  town in the Valley, went to private schools.  Our parents are still married.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's, uh, people that you're absolutely right about.  This victimization is a way to get ahead now.  It's this, it, uh, people put you up on this pedestal, like, oh, poor you, and just can't  give you enough.  Right. 
[01:37:00]  Right.  And it works in America.  I mean, it says a nice thing about America, I think, and Americans, why it works.  Um, at the end, I go through how, how America is the most charitable nation in the history  of the world.  Yeah.  Um, Americans love disasters.  They love to start, you know, helping, um, and, and, and raising money and making sandwiches  and donating blood.  They, they, you know, give them a good tsunami, and, oh, Americans, they're almost, they're  almost, you know, gleeful for a disaster, so they can jump in and help.  Um, but, but they're not used to, you know, liberals are taking advantage of this, of this 
[01:37:30]  kindness and charitable instinct of Americans by constantly claiming to be victims when they  are.  You know, it, it is amazing that, that, uh, for a country that is supposedly built on the  fact that you, you attain, uh, wealth and, um, success in this country, and that was the  American dream.  I mean, it's called the American dream.  And now you're so penalized for that and looked at like a villain if you've done that. 
[01:38:00]  And then it, now it's your responsibility to take the work and success that you have made  and now dish it out to, uh, supposed victims, uh, to, to even things out and give the guy  behind you a chance.  Right.  Uh, when, when did this happen?  When did this happen?  And, and who was the first one, like, to spark this?  Who was responsible for this mess we're, uh, we're in now, as far as that's concerned?  Well, it, it seems to only apply to, um, hardworking middle-class Americans and, and Republicans. 
[01:38:30]  Um, because, um, the Democrats aren't exactly poverty-stricken, um, and comparing their wealth  with how much charity they give, which I also throw in the last chapter, is mind-boggling.  It is one of those things you just sensed, you knew it had to be true, and, you know, of  course, we have the numbers. 
[01:39:00]  And, I mean, it happens, it usually comes up just with the two leading presidential candidates.  I have a whole slew of, of prominent Democrats, um, Biden, Kerry, Teddy Kennedy, um, spending  more on, on, you know, the taxes to their yachts than they do when they're charitable  giving.  And, meanwhile, Republicans are giving more than, more than tithing most of the time.  You know, I'd like to see, uh, if Teddy Kennedy would have, uh, still been alive if he went  to one of these socialized, um, socialist, uh, uh, medical programs that, uh, everybody 
[01:39:30]  wants to enact.  Right.  Uh, you think he would have went to the best doctor ever, uh, that he can afford, or do  you think he would have just stood in line with other people at some, um, uh, socialized,  uh, medical facility?  No, you're exactly right.  That's, that's a very perceptive point, which is they want socialized medicine for the rest  of us.  They, the liberals are rich enough that they can get the medical care they want.  Are they rich enough?  I thought, uh, hopefully they don't make more than 200,000 a year. 
[01:40:00]  So, uh, they make so much more and have so much more.  I mean, that's, that's another point.  We don't have a wealth tax in America.  So, for George Soros, who's, who's, who's made it through his financial shenanigans, you  know, has it, has it safely in offshore accounts, um, this is an income tax, not a wealth tax.  I think you might hear liberals squealing a little more if we ever had a wealth tax.  Hey, there's, uh, it's amazing how, like, the media is so,  uh, they hate being told that they're liberal.  Like, a fox definitely slants conservative, and they, they're okay with that, it seems. 
[01:40:30]  What, what do you think the media is so resistant?  Because Andy Roney, even, as a liberal, called him out, and he said, yeah, I think the media  is transparently liberal, and he was saying that that's fine, it is what it is.  What do you think is this thing where they just refuse to acknowledge that they are liberal?  Well, part of it is just to enrage conservatives, just to tell a lie right to our faces.  It makes them happy.  Um, and part of it is that, well, liberal is like a curse word, and I'd like to think 
[01:41:00]  I had some small part in accomplishing that.  Well, you've written, what, six books?  This is going to be number seven now, this week.  Jesus.  And, by the way, if you remember the night of the comedy show, my favorite moment, and  I want to know if you remember it, is we have a comedian friend of ours who is arguably  the dumbest person over the age of five, and his name is Rich Voss, and you recognized him,  and he's so shame-filled, he wasn't expecting a celebrity to recognize him, and he, do you  remember that?  He panicked, and he looked at you, and you went, oh, I know you, and he went, oh, I'm Laura 
[01:41:30]  Ingram, oh, good old Voss.  And I think you said at the time, like, you joked back to him, like, you said, like, I've  written six bestsellers for people to not think that we are the same person.  Right.  We've gone in different directions.  She's radio.  I'm booked.  And have you ever tried stand-up?  Oh, I think it's the most terrifying thing.  I really admire stand-up.  No, I have not. 
[01:42:00]  I would be terrified.  You've got a lot of zingers, though, you know.  It would work well on a stage.  There's an audience.  I guess I'm, you will, you guys will appreciate this story.  I do give a lot of speeches, a lot of college speeches, and like my books, I try to make them  amusing while making my point.  And one year after I spoke at CPAC, one of the Muslim students in the audience, come  I do not think was a conservative, was a little testy with me.  But as I said, you know, Muslims killed 3,000 Americans. 
[01:42:30]  I'm still a little testy with you guys, too.  And he came up afterward as I was doing the book signing, and he said, you are not a political  commentator.  You're a stand-up comedian.  And I said, thank you.  Thank you.  Any idiot can have a political opinion.  Comedy is hard.  How great is it that he's trying to be insulting, oh, you're just a comedian, and he's actually  making you feel like you're a little compliment.  Elevating my status. 
[01:43:00]  You ever notice that the liberals, for some reason, they can't ever really get together  on anything and use their power base to really make an attack and make it sound reasonable?  Plausible.  Yeah, and plausible.  For some reason, conservative radio has always had a place, a large audience.  And liberal radio just, I guess there's so many factions of liberals that there's a lot 
[01:43:30]  of infighting.  I think it's more that they just can't take a punch.  I mean, you can't grow up in America and turn into a conservative without arguing it, you  know, even if it's just in your head or with the TV or with the magazines, you know, every  day.  And conservatives like to argue.  We argue with one another.  That has always struck me as the real difference between Fox News and MSNBC and CNN. 
[01:44:00]  That Fox is a debate station.  I mean, who's the equivalent on MSNBC of liberal Geraldo Rivera, liberal Shep Smith, liberal  Greta Van Susteren, liberal Chris Wallace?  And we'll see what happens when Combs goes.  But Handigan Combs, the second highest rated cable show, that is a debate show where they  invite liberals on.  And I just think it's more interesting to watch a debate, whereas liberals want to censor  opposing viewpoints, as with the fairness doctrine, as with my lifetime ban from NBC that was rescinded 
[01:44:30]  after eight hours.  That is, God, that's a great point, though, that a lot of times conservatives do like to  just duke it out and get out there and discuss the points.  And the liberals seem to want to just squash the opposing viewpoint instead of arguing it.  Or have other soft liberals or other like-minded liberals on just to both kind of agree with  each other.  And you raise a great point about that sickening fairness doctrine, which the bottom line is  ratings drive radio. 
[01:45:00]  And look, whether people like Rush Limbaugh or Hannity or they hate them, they get big,  big ratings, so they get big contracts.  For some reason, liberal talk has not taken off across the country.  And so instead of going, look, for whatever reason, there's something in liberals that annoys  people to listen to every day.  They go, we have to have a fairness doctrine.  But yet they don't seem to want that for the editorials and the time.  Right, or for the movie industry.  Yeah.  That's why I love the title of the fairness doctrine. 
[01:45:30]  And it's so Orwellian.  Yeah.  I mean, and it's just the only place they want to do it is in talk radio because the  conservatives have dominated completely.  Right.  The original theory of it was when there were not as many radio stations and there were more  newspapers, that there weren't enough radio stations that, you know, we'd have to make  sure that all opinions were being heard.  Well, now it's exactly the reverse.  Radio is infinite, whereas there are very few newspapers. 
[01:46:00]  There are a limited number of broadcast networks.  There are a limited number of Hollywood studios.  But the one most competitive industry in the universe, that's the one we need the government  to step in and mandate fairness.  Hey, we have to take a break in, but the book is Guilty Liberal Victims and Their Assault  on America.  They're talking, and one thing I want to ask you, too, they're saying that, because you  talk about how single motherhood or single mothers, are they oversimplifying what you  said because they're going, well, she attacks single mothers, or is it more of just an attack 
[01:46:30]  on the fact that families that are broken up are a big cause of kids not being raised  right?  Oh, yes, the latter, you got it right, and that is what I was expecting the most backlash  to, but the numbers are in, the figures are overwhelming.  Illegitimacy rate has gone up 300% since 1970.  That has been a plan of the left, and they don't want anyone interfering with it.  Yeah, don't throw those facts in there.  That really boggles their mind when you do that.  But they seem to, like, they make it look like you're just attacking a single mother. 
[01:47:00]  It seems like they're just oversimplifying it just to try to vilify you for saying something  they don't like.  Yes, or worse, that I'm vilifying the children, whereas, you know, the point is, a beautiful  example of what I'm talking about in the book, single mothers are discussed as if they're  these unsung heroines, movies celebrating, magazines celebrating, a zillion books about,  you know, the pluck and hard work of the single mother.  They're the biggest victimizers we have in the society, and they're victimizing their own  children.  Fantastic.  Well, Anthony, say goodbye to your soulmate. 
[01:47:30]  We've got to take a break.  I love her.  Anne, thanks so much.  I'm coming back.  Yeah.  Great to talk to you today.  All right, Anne, I'll definitely talk to you again.  Bye-bye.  Take care, bye.  All right.  Anne Coulter, everyone.  She's me with cans.  Yeah, and brains.  Well, those two.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Man, politics get them talking out there. 
[01:48:00]  Certainly does, man.  I was, as the interview was going on, I was reading Pal Talk, which is scrolling in front  of me here.  Yeah.  And just people split right down the middle, loving it.  And then other people just hating, not that we were interviewing her, but hating what she  was saying and what it's about.  It's like, dude, it's an opposing viewpoint of what you have.  Deal with it.  Don't be like, get her off.  That's the biggest thing.  Get her off.  You know how many liberal comedians we've had sit down and just, you know, spew their 
[01:48:30]  stuff out that have been in here?  Not, you know, the regulars.  Yeah, I understand.  But some of the other comics that come in here are very liberal-minded and...  Well, I'm glad you brought that up because I swear to you, I'm going to read the answer  of feedback from top to bottom.  Okay.  For the most part, there's a couple you just get rid of because they're requesting a song  or something.  They don't even know what they're listening to.  So, uh, Bird and Philly, he's a regular.  Three, two, one.  Cue Patrice calling in to tell Ant to nail that. 
[01:49:00]  Urgh.  Uh, Josh in Jersey, this bitch is like a pro wrestler.  It's all shtick.  F you guys for humoring her.  You know something?  Uh, let me just, uh, comment on that, too.  I don't care what her motive is, to tell you the truth.  What she's saying is, uh, viable for her political viewpoint.  It's fine.  Uh, is she doing it to write books?  Is she doing it as a career?  As a...  Yes!  What do you think? 
[01:49:30]  Hey, yes!  She's going to just, uh, do this for nothing and then, uh, go out and haul garbage?  Right.  No, this is her job.  It's what she does.  Is there some shtick to it?  Yeah.  But I see that as her being clever.  Yeah.  And, and funny in the way she delivers her, uh, her, uh, politics.  We did our job.  We got people reacting.  It continues.  Porky York from Minnesota.  Ann Coulter is one hot lady.  You got one of those coming in.  Someone from their cell, uh, phone saying, say something, Opie.  You sound like a fool.  I, I can't be bothered for the most part. 
[01:50:00]  I, I openly admit I can't be bothered with political discussions.  I try to throw in something here and there, but, you know, that's, that's my, my, my, that's  my, you know, it's not one of my, my strengths or, or something I'm, I'm, uh, that interested  in when it comes right down to it.  But, but it's something people are, uh, very interested in out there.  Especially in this election year.  Uh, someone from nowhere says, Jimmy Norton, why tell a lie?  Fairness doctrine?  Who wants that?  No one has ever said that.  No one.  So you are a fat, no neck jerk. 
[01:50:30]  I, I, uh, that's not true, dude.  That they, they were talking about the fairness doctrine.  That's absolutely, you're ill-informed.  They were discussing that.  And I think Chuck Schumer was, uh, had, had brought it back up.  It was mentioned.  And I, it was, it was, it was stupid.  So you're just wrong, bro.  It was mentioned.  Uh, we keep going here.  Uh, Josh from Jersey.  Yeah.  Like Fox, Fox has pussy liberals on to be able to S all over.  But they still have them on.  They have them on. 
[01:51:00]  They have them on.  And if they, if they had, uh, uh, a good viewpoint, they'd be able to voice it on, on the show.  And a lot of liberals probably won't go on.  Like, I know Hannity, he interviews, I hate when people hate Hannity.  Only because the guy, uh, he has Jesse Jackson on.  Sharp did any of these guys.  The biggest names they have, he will have on and go after them.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's continue.  Uh, Ari from Bayville.  Z.  Lots of Zs.  That's just idiotic. 
[01:51:30]  She's, she's a, she's a, go find a twofer somewhere there.  She's a compelling guest.  Like, how can you not like her when she's one of the very few people who is a prominent  that attacks the left as brutally as she does?  Yeah.  Uh, Greg Brady's leftovers from whack bag.  Wait a minute.  Isn't she saying she's a victim of NBC's ban?  F this horse face stupid C.  I'm just reading them right down the list.  Look, you can see for yourself.  I'm not trying to skew this whatsoever.  I'm just trying to, you know, read them as they came in during the interview.  Uh, and then the same guy, I love Jimmy, but I hate his new best friend. 
[01:52:00]  Let me tell you something.  I, uh, I, I've even, uh, I like Ann Coulter.  I've always kind of liked her, even when I was annoyed at her for that 9-11 comment, because  again, she's unapologetic.  It's amazing how she just says what she wants to say.  She's funny.  She's a really funny writer.  Um, and people still want to hate her.  It's a visceral reaction to her.  Right.  I don't know why.  People aren't trashing, uh, all these other pundits. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, I know, right?  And I got to tell you, all these people had an opinion on the interview and stuff, and  unfortunately, they wrote their, their comments.  They should have called.  We would have put you on with Ann Coulter to say exactly what you're, you're, you're writing  here.  And not.  Because it's not really fair to kind of read a lot of this stuff after the interview  when she's long gone.  And the one guy says something about the Fairness Doctrine.  Okay, at least he offered an opinion on something she talked about.  But all these other ones, she's a C, a Z. How about, hey man, uh, she was wrong about  this.  Or how about, hey, her interpretation of the media treatment of Obama is wrong. 
[01:53:00]  They can't argue that.  Mm-hmm.  No one's arguing that she's really right or wrong.  They just say that they don't like her.  It's so stupid.  Tyler from Columbus.  F off, Ann.  You hate Democrats.  We get it.  Brendan from Boston.  Are we seeing the beginning of, uh, Ant Alter?  Oh, oh.  Putting the name.  Did I say that right?  Kind of, Ant?  It's hard to say, I guess.  That's, Ant Alter, maybe?  Nah, I've sworn off media chicks.  She probably dates nerdy guys in glasses. 
[01:53:30]  She's not going to date some shock jock in a hat.  Josh from Jersey.  And he, Anthony's like.  That's how my follicles grow in.  Sure, that's if she's not going to date Juan Epstein.  Josh from Jersey.  Way to humor this twat.  That came in.  Come on, now.  Kay from Jersey just writes, wow, so boring.  Was it really?  Well, Kay is sitting there.  I've never seen instant feedback spin so fast, uh, in front of my eyes like a slot machine.  They couldn't wait to get their comments in.  Like, we're not supposed to talk to, first of all, I like her. 
[01:54:00]  And I agree with, I don't agree with everything she said.  I don't agree that there's no more racism in America.  There's a lot of things she'll say that I don't agree with.  But so what?  She's saying her opinion, honestly.  It's amazing how affected, people think they're supposed to hate her.  She's got this reaction.  Ann Coulter, she's a bitch.  And I watched her in the cellar that night.  Everyone that walked up to her, she was nice to.  Everyone that approached her, she was pleasant.  She was very genuine.  People have this weird vibe like she's this, she's the picture of, uh, all the mean anti-Democrat 
[01:54:30]  and they're supposed to hate her.  And then you listen to her.  It's like, you know what?  She makes sense in a lot of what she says.  Ari from Bayville.  Opie, new bit.  Can Ann Coulter go five sentences without saying liberal?  We get it.  She's a C.  Well, the book is called Guilty Liberal Victims.  What should she talk about?  Uh...  The new GM problem with their lime green paint jobs?  God, did I just flounder on that one.  I tried to improv and I reached into a bag and I came up with nothing.  I've never reached into a bag and come up so empty in my life, actually. 
[01:55:00]  In 40 years.  I fished around in the bag, too.  And you could hear the bag sounds.  Like, you know when you're fishing around in the bag?  CM from Long Island.  Just about done with this.  Is this a damn replay from October?  Enough, Anthony.  It's over.  You lost.  Obama won.  Get over it.  I'm over it, first of all.  And, uh, yeah, I wanted to comment on something Jimmy said where he didn't agree with it.  There's no racism in America.  I do believe that also, or else Obama wouldn't be driving around in an armored personnel carrier 
[01:55:30]  that they seem to have built for him, especially just for him.  Is it different than past presidents?  Oh, my God.  You should see this thing.  I haven't seen it yet.  It's in the paper.  It's hysterical.  It's like an Escalade frame and pretty much a tank on top of it.  Um, uh, but, but, but also, uh, as far as racism in America and people being racist, I don't know.  There's a difference because, like I said before, uh, hey, he worked himself up to president of the United States. 
[01:56:00]  So, no more excuses.  That's what I said.  I think there's a certain amount of institutionalized racism that does exist and it's kind of subtle.  I don't think it's nearly as prevalent as people who are, like, good at being perpetual victims claim it is.  But I do think it's more than a lot of people want to acknowledge.  I think there's somewhere in the middle it does exist.  I don't think it's as much as people acknowledge, to tell you the truth.  I think, I think, uh, white on black racism isn't as prevalent as black on white racism. 
[01:56:30]  I think, uh, a larger, well, we're looking at a, uh, a smaller population of black people to white people in this country.  But I think the percentage-wise, black people are much more racist against white people in this day and age than white people are against black people.  I absolutely see it that way.  I think more overtly racist, but I don't think that the feelings are any different.  Um, I, I, please, I mean, we, we live in New York.  You're kind of used to seeing everybody here.  Not that other places are stupid, but, uh, you know, you go around and, I, I, I disagree. 
[01:57:00]  I just think that blacks are more open about their racism.  You know something?  More honest about it.  You're talking about maybe some place, uh, down south where maybe the Klan is still active, things like that.  Sure, there's racism there, but go to some areas in Detroit and you tell me that there isn't, uh, uh, uh, you know,  a white guy would be walking down the street and just get his ass, uh, handed to him just for being white in that area.  Yeah.  Uh, I think that's more prevalent than, uh, white on black, uh, racism. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, I think white on black is, uh, I mean, I think it's less violence prone and, uh, I just think it's a little bit more subtle.  It's a little bit more, uh, with certain hiring policies.  Like, uh, like I, I don't, I sometimes it's not spoken about.  That I don't agree with either anymore.  Hiring policies, go to any, go to any, you, you travel all over the country.  Any airport you land in, when you look out on that tarmac, who's doing the baggage? 
[01:58:00]  Who's behind every counter?  I know, I'm too busy looking at who's flying the plane.  Thank God he looks like me.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Darkie, carry the bag while we fly the plane.  Good point.  But no, no, I'm not saying that.  I don't mean that.  Department of Motor Vehicles.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  City jobs, state jobs.  They are all.  Yes.  Not all.  I'm, I'm, I'm generalizing here, but a majority of those jobs are African-Americans. 
[01:58:30]  I'm not saying that, that black people aren't hired.  I'm just saying that a lot of places it's been, I believe it, I'm not for hiring quotas either.  I just think that a lot of times in certain corporate things, it's probably a little bit.  Still the old boys club kind of mentality.  I think probably to a certain extent.  Not like it used to be, but I think that it exists more than those people would acknowledge it exists.  Perhaps in the upper echelon of those companies, I, I agree with you, but, but.  Not me, not the physical labor jobs, like anybody could do, most people could do DMV. 
[01:59:00]  Most people could do those tarmac jobs.  Those are cushy jobs, man.  Yeah.  Those state jobs, federal jobs like that.  And, and most of the times when you go into those places to get, you know, paperwork done or whatever,  there are black people working those jobs.  I don't see where this big problem is that they're not being hired.  There's this racism.  There's this, just stop.  I, I still think, I've heard it from enough people who I respect and who I know who are  not knee-jerk lunatics where, uh, I do think, I do think it's still prevalent. 
[01:59:30]  It's just not like it used to be.  And it's not, uh, nearly as bad as, as to me, like Jackson or Sharpton paint, you know,  at all.  I think, um, we're going to have to agree to disagree on this, Jimmy.  Fair enough.  All right.  Well, and, uh, one more comment, by the way, and, uh, Anthony should choke on the C's Adam's apple.  Jesus Christ.  People are too much.  I'm just trying to bring a little humor back into the show.  I'm very, I'll be honest.  I'm, I find my, you don't want to stray away from the humor too far. 
[02:00:00]  Jimmy's pilot line almost killed me.  Yeah, well, that was a good line.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I'm looking in the cockpit.  Oh, Christ.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we do the quick break and do a little mop-up and then get into the music marathon  for the people here in New York?  All right.  Of course we should.  All right.  We'll do that.  Opie and Anthony.  Getting ready to get out of here.  Opie and Anthony.  We're going to start a music marathon for the people in New York. 
[02:00:30]  Speaking of radio, uh,  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  He's good for one every day.  He writes,  Heard on FM radio this morning,  Why download songs when we can play them for you for free?  Oh, yeah?  That would be the wrong approach for programmers out there.  You're not going to stop people from downloading music.  Why fly when you can take a covered wagon?  Right. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, that's probably a bad, a bad way.  The radio has a lot of interesting things.  Like, there's reasons to listen to radio, but not because you don't want to download.  Yeah.  There's things you just got to accept as something that's not going to change and then try to  work around that.  Yeah, if you've been downloading music for a few years now, you're not just going to stop  doing it and go,  Radio!  Right.  Hey.  No.  What they should do is have a thing that says,  Downloadings for Queers.  Right. 
[02:01:30]  That would stop me in my tracks.  It has stopped me.  At least try to have a little fun with it.  Yeah.  You're not stopping that.  That horse left the barn a long time ago.  It's like trying to put the toothpaste...  That whore left the barn?  I thought that's what you said, too.  I said the horse.  It's not like you said that whore left the barn.  No, I said horse.  Where's this barn from?  I was doing my da voice.  That whore horse that killed that guy?  No, the guy was the whore.  Yes, he was the whore.  Naughty boy. 
[02:02:00]  He had clothespins on his bag.  How much stimulation do you need, fella?  You have a horse jumping up on you.  You're almighty.  Yeah, who decides they need a little more stimulation?  Yeah, it's like, well, you know what?  Two feet of horse is not enough.  Like, quite enough.  I need something to put me over the top.  Uh-huh.  Clothespins.  What are some of those other analogies we got?  You got the toothpaste back into the tube.  Uh, no use crying over spilled milk?  Uh, I don't know.  Whoever cried over spilled milk? 
[02:02:30]  I did.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  Because I only spilled it because my uncle pushed me face down into a pillow while I was drinking my milk.  Told you it was milk.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't cry over dried milk on your back.  Oh, my God.  Thank God.  I pulled out of a tailspin right there.  I don't know if you know.  That was good.  I fired a dud out today.  That was good.  That was good.  I was actually embarrassed about it.  I forget what it was.  Something this morning I said I couldn't even address it.  It was like, it just, I don't want to say it fell flat.  It was as if a person hadn't spoken. 
[02:03:00]  And I just kind of backed off.  I was like, hey.  There are times when you do this show, you just hope everyone goes deaf at the exact same moment.  Including the audience.  You just like.  Please.  You just, you know, just hope and pray they didn't hear that.  You have those moments?  I had one.  Oh, please.  Look at me.  A million a day.  I don't remember what it was, but oh, my God.  I was like, ah.  Get all heated.  Hey, I think we can squeeze this in before we get out of here.  Man smashes into this adult shop, right?  Uh, for sex with the sex dolls. 
[02:03:30]  Can't you just buy these?  Of course you can.  I, you know.  I didn't, I didn't need a real answer, but a man has smashed his way into an adult shop  and had sex with blow-up dolls before abandoning the sex toys in a nearby lane.  Ugh.  Uh, his method of entry is to smash through walls, squeeze through tight holes.  Yeah.  The owner of this, uh, particular adult shop, who wished to be named only as Vogue.  Come on.  Uh, so that in a first unreported break-in, the man had stolen five dolls and had sex with 
[02:04:00]  one of them.  He has been taking the dolls out the back and blowing them up and using the dolls and leaving  them in the alley, he said.  That's horrible.  This is a creep.  Plastic doll Americans.  Like, you ever have...  Boo!  Yeah.  It's funny, we had just talked about those moments.  Yeah, those, uh, great moments that just...  This is going great!  I was trying to go for the whole thing of how the dolls have been, like, who cares kind 
[02:04:30]  of a thing?  Kind of an ironic, like, who cares that...  Oh!  Ah, the guy continues.  It's totally bizarre.  Did everyone go deaf a couple of seconds ago?  I hope so.  No, but we...  So did we.  Yeah.  We want to, though.  We were ready to take pencils to our eardrums.  It's totally bizarre.  It's a real concern that someone like that is out on the street.  Vogue said a sex toy also went missing in the second break-in, and that the offender 
[02:05:00]  had a liking for the doll named Jungle Jane.  Uh-oh.  Which has been taken on both occasions, so he's looking for the Jungle Janes.  Wow.  He said he was dumbfounded that the burglar also had the weird habit of cleaning up the  mess he had made after entering the building.  Oh, not that mess.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Oh, okay.  Building another doll behind, right.  Oh.  Yeah.  He just left DNA evidence at the crime scene.  Of course he has, so...  Good boy.  It's one of the weirdest stories coming out today. 
[02:05:30]  That was called a little filler, because now it's time to start the music marathon.  What do you say, people?  Yeah, let's rock.  I say January 18th, Borgata, one show left.  It might be sold out, I'm not sure, the night before MLK's birthday, which apparently you  boys are working the next day.  Have fun.  Yeah, we're working that day.  God bless.  We wanted to take off as a tribute.  We felt it was about time, after all these years, we acknowledge the black man.  Pay respect.  But this company doesn't believe in the black man, so...  Yeah.  ...so we'll be here working. 
[02:06:00]  Is that what they told you, Stump Brain, pretty much?  Pretty much.  Yeah, pretty much.  Will they all be here that day?  No, of course not.  Corporate takes off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're the suckers.  We've always been and always will, I guess.  We're the suckers.  Sap.  Suckers.  Music marathon time.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Sap.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Opie and Anthony.  Sands Jimmy.  Where's Jimmy now?  Returning the phone.  Is he returning the phone that he got yesterday at this time? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, I remember what we were talking about.  He went to the Verizon store to get a phone, and we're like, all right, well, Jimmy's getting  a phone, whatever.  Right.  He came in and said it almost didn't make it back to the store today, because he was  going to throw it out the window because it sucked ass.  But what could have been the problem?  Didn't he do his research, and he was excited about this new phone, ran out and got it?  It's so bad.  He had to go in between shows.  He couldn't wait.  No, he said it's so bad. 
[02:07:00]  And now he can't wait to bring it back?  It has Windows Mobile on it, which sucks a mean dick.  Why didn't he know that ahead of time?  How about I shut that off?  Boink.  Yeah, I guess he thought it was a cool phone.  Who had it?  Steve?  Did Steve recommend it?  Steve is the king of terrible cellular technology.  Yeah, of horrible, horrible cell phones.  He always thinks that the one phone that he's interested in is going to be the next iPhone  killer.  This is the iPhone killer. 
[02:07:30]  I have it now.  Everything's the iPhone killer.  It's put out by Tandy.  I was trying to pick one, too.  Casio's making a comeback, folks.  Casio's phone.  It's amazing.  I was ready with my StarTac joke.  It's the size of a car battery.  It's the cellular Sinclair.  Somebody's laughing at that.  Yeah, right on.  I'm in on that one.  Sometimes I'm not in on these references.  I got that one, Danny. 
[02:08:00]  So Steve thought it was going to be the big iPhone killer.  And I guess, you know Jimmy.  He gets caught up in a frenzy.  You can hypnotize Jimmy with Tech Talk.  Yeah, I didn't.  Hypnotize him.  And that's what you did.  I didn't realize how obsessive he was going to get about this.  He asked me about a phone that I don't own.  My chick owns this Samsung Omnia thing.  I said, she likes it.  And that's it.  And then he went off into a tizzy to the Verizon store.  She likes you, too.  Yeah, exactly.  Doesn't say much for her taste.  I like you, too.  I'm teasing. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, that's one of those jokes.  I know.  But it wasn't a gay joke or an incompetent joke.  Thank you.  So we're on a whole new category.  That's a bit encouraging for everybody.  Anyway, so now he's upset that it's Windows Mobile,  which I didn't realize he had a problem with.  Not only that, I saw him.  He punched something in,  and then you see this stupid Windows thing just spin and spin and spin  and try to get a connection.  And then he was searching his phone contacts. 
[02:09:00]  So he types in a name,  and after he typed it in, he goes,  Now, look, I'm looking at the screen,  and you see the letters popping up long after he typed them.  The letters are popping up in the search window.  It's like, shouldn't that be instant?  It is.  Well, you know what?  Yes!  I've got a Windows Mobile phone, too.  And I hit contacts, and my contacts hit up,  and I can scroll through them instantly,  and I've got over 1,000 of them.  So I don't, you know,  I'm not experiencing the same problems as you've got.  Windows Mobile.  You get on Mac things with that, right?  No.  That's right.  No, you can't.  That could be a problem. 
[02:09:30]  There's something else going on, too.  It's not that warm in the studio.  It's not freezing,  but the temp could be a few degrees higher.  I'm jacking for a while.  No, I mention this,  because, Steve, you're sweating like a pig.  What is wrong with you?  He's wearing three layers.  I'm wearing lots of layers,  because it's really cold in that CBS office,  because of the way they keep the temperature in that place.  But we all are going from one environment to the other.  No one else is sweating.  Your forehead is glistening.  It comes with a job.  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know. 
[02:10:00]  I really don't know.  I mean, I'm layered up.  Now I'm hot.  At the other place, I'm freezing all morning.  Anticipation of the next insult.  Are you on all those supplements still?  Nope.  Off all of them.  Or maybe a little withdrawal going on, then.  Withdrawal.  Perhaps.  It's met the roids.  Boy, man.  Those aren't fun.  Standing room only for the Guitar Hero match  that's going to happen in a few minutes here.  I was very excited to come in on a Thursday  and see the bleachers with people on there. 
[02:10:30]  Very nice.  Yeah, we got a nice crowd out there.  Not standing room only.  That was kind of a gag.  They want to see the big Guitar Hero.  Guitar Hero competition.  Oh, here's Jimmy Norton.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi.  I haven't had time in the Verizon service.  I'll be back in a second.  I bought the Anthony.  I mean, today it just wouldn't function.  Yeah, it sucked.  And they're trying to charge me a $35 restocking fee.  Oh, boy.  No.  We had both the same model. 
[02:11:00]  Well, it's a piece of shit.  Why would we go with the same model?  So I said let them get the Blackberry Storm  and they don't have that.  It's amazing.  What a fucking nightmare.  Restocking fee?  Yeah.  $30 restocking fee.  That is a $30.  You think it actually takes $30  for them to fucking throw that thing in a box somewhere?  Because they don't restock it.  Right.  They send it back.  No.  And so the woman did something 
[02:11:30]  where she was trying to open contact  and nothing was happening.  It's amazing how the resistance they have  to helping me in these places.  Did you call her a cunt?  No, no.  It's just, you know, it's what you'd expect.  And then, you know, I tried to get the new type Blackberry  and, of course, they're out of it again.  So it's a great job, Ryzen,  trying to compete with the iPhone.  Yeah.  And just embarrassing yourselves.  I'm trying to do business  and it's just a fucking nightmare. 
[02:12:00]  Are you calling from your iPhone?  I'm calling from my,  believe it or not,  actually working with the moment iPhone.  If I was calling from the other one,  I'd have to do it, punching at a six.  Right.  Well, let's see, Jimmy,  on Star Trek, like, with the communicator.  This fucking thing sucks.  I'm on the planet.  I can't fucking talk to the Enterprise.  Hello, Scott.  He's got, see?  I got to transport up.  I can't get anybody.  This fucking phaser doesn't work.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy,  you don't do well with technology at all.  Fuck this. 
[02:12:30]  This tricorder is a piece of shit.  I fucking said it to stun  and it's not stunning.  I'm trying to analyze a rock  and what does it do?  The thing spins, spins, spins, nothing.  Spots works fine.  I am listening to a woman on the phone.  She's not like at customer service  and she's over there on the phone  and I hear her talking to a customer service rep  and she's going,  look, it wiped out my calendar.  And then she's going,  I can't manually enter my contacts.  The dummies at customer service on the phone  are saying that she should go back 
[02:13:00]  and manually enter her contacts.  All the contacts.  Yeah, that can't take that long, right?  Instead of just syncing it up and...  Yeah.  And they have to order me the phone.  I'm just like giving my money back.  Yeah.  Once again, I've come here to do business.  It's a fucking...  I hate it.  I hate...  I don't want to take my dick out.  I'm so irritated.  Take your dick out and just stand there.  You know that?  How embarrassing.  I would be arrested, I'm sure.  Yeah.  But everybody in Verizon would know that by tomorrow. 
[02:13:30]  You know, this guy was so disgusted  being pulled his dick out.  Maybe we should be nicer.  It's an insult here in the States.  All right.  Well, we're getting ready for the big guitar hero match.  So, Jimmy, good luck with your cell phone.  I'm going to get a new phone  because they don't have it.  It's not the good deal.  All right, sweetie.  We'll see you soon.  Uh, Lady Trucker.  What's up, Lady Trucker?  Good morning, fellas.  I'm looking forward to Evan the Fireman  posing Danny today.  Ugh.  Well, we're setting ready to go.  I mean, it looks pretty good. 
[02:14:00]  Have we tried out the guitar hero  to make sure there's no glitches this time, Danny?  Well, I'll calibrate the system.  Yeah.  I'll calibrate.  The, uh...  I can't see, uh, Lady Trucker.  I cannot see...  Uh, Evan is his name?  Yeah.  I can't see him.  That's a little insult.  No, I know.  Uh, him winning this, uh, because I've seen Danny many times play guitar hero,  and, um, I can't imagine somebody doing better.  Well, I mean, I'm a, you know, I'm a, I'm a decent enough player. 
[02:14:30]  Mm-hmm.  I think that, uh, I could definitely hold my own in most, most circles.  Mm-hmm.  I don't think I'm, uh, gonna win any, like, professional competitions.  Oh.  But I am definitely, uh, I would, I would definitely take out a bunch of people if I was in one.  Put it that way.  That's good.  That's humble.  I like that.  I think the people like hearing that.  A little humble.  Uh, not like stupid, um, primetime Sam Roberts pumping up his sap fucking, uh, uh, whatever 
[02:15:00]  he is.  Yeah.  What is he?  I don't have any sap, so I don't know who you're talking about.  What?  You're, you're...  The only person I represent is a champion, Evan Champion.  Oh, right, Evan, uh, no, I, I...  That's not his last name, though.  I thought it was Seaman.  What?  No, it's...  Seaman?  It's...  No, it's not Champion.  I saw, I remember doing this interview.  His name is Evan Seaman.  Ah!  It's...  It's Champion.  It's Champion.  It's Champion.  Well, you must have got a name change or something.  Oh.  Well...  Registered under an alias for this competition. 
[02:15:30]  Danny's being humble, and that's kind of a cool thing to do.  Mm-mm.  And then you sit there, and then you just riff and, and kick ass, and then when you're  done, you're like, yeah, that's what I did.  I said I was gonna do it, and I did it.  You don't pull this big, hype, fucking, Sam, fucking, Roberts bullshit.  There's no bullshit.  Danny's being humble for one reason, so when he ultimately loses, he can say, yeah, you  know, I didn't know from the beginning.  Because, yeah, if he starts bragging, then he'll look silly when he loses.  Oh, shit. 
[02:16:00]  That's how your guy's gonna look.  Silly.  Silly, because he just bragged the shit out of himself, and you pumped the shit out  of him yesterday.  And, uh, Danny's just, you know, hey.  With a name like Fireman, Evan Champion.  How is a man gonna look silly?  But that's not his name, though.  It's, it's, it's Seaman.  No, it's Champion.  It's Evan Champion, Dan.  It's Evan, it's Evan Cumhead.  Where is Evan?  We gotta get him in here.  Sam brought in, uh, something for Wackbag, though, Sam. 
[02:16:30]  What, what am I holding in my hand, because you couldn't, you, you, you ran over people  to get this in.  Well, yesterday, Danny made...  Wait, there's, there's a sign out.  The bleachers got fans, and there's a guy holding up an Evan sucks, uh, sign.  It's an Evan with a circle and slash through it.  Right.  What's the other, uh, sign being raised in the, on the bleachers?  What does it say?  Crunch gear supports Daniel.  Oh.  Jason Ross.  Oh, no.  Nobody even goes to crunch gear.  Fuck crunch gear.  Crunch gear.  Crunch gear.  Crunch gear.  We like to crunch gear. 
[02:17:00]  So you brought this in.  You ran over some people.  What's, what's going on?  There's a bit of, uh, uh, of controversy?  Well, Danny made the claim yesterday that he was the Guitar Hero champion of the PNC Bank  Art Center parking lot.  Uh-huh.  Well, not everybody agrees with him, including one of his challengers.  Well, let me read this post from Plastic Rocker.  It is written, I've actually played Danny before at the PNC Bank Art Center, the New Jersey  Virus Tour, August 07, and there was controversy.  I think I was his only real competition that day, and we were playing Jessica. 
[02:17:30]  It was a little back and forth, but I started to pull ahead and beat him, and then all of  a sudden, very conveniently, the generator ran out of gas, and the game died.  Uh-huh.  There was no, uh, definitive winner, and so I was not able to claim the trophy that  was probably rightfully mine.  What happened to that trophy, Dan?  Did you have one of your cronies pull the plug in the game?  Now I have cronies.  You have cronies, too.  I hope Evan, whoever he is, kicks your ass and takes your spot as the top fake plastic 
[02:18:00]  rocker in the office.  Fake plastic rocker.  If you're wondering who I am, Google image search, guitar hero, no quotes, and I'm the  first image of a real person, the 12th thumbnail, I'm the guy with the flamethrower guitar, I  should bring that thing in and set both of you on fire.  Well, I would hate, I would really hate to, uh, to be the first human being that shows  up on the Google image search for guitar hero.  Uh, I would not brag about that at all.  Plastic rocker, uh, posts one. 
[02:18:30]  Ah!  He's a new whack bagger.  You gotta spend somewhere.  He's too much time winning guitar hero to be on whack bag.  He's cool.  Were you pumping this shithead, too?  Well, I'm just saying, Danny isn't exactly the undisputed champion, there's some dispute  there.  I do remember the PNC Bank, uh, guitar hero tourney.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, I do remember registering for the expert competition, and I do recall, uh, I think the  competition for expert, at least, beginning as the, as the actual comedians were hitting  the stage, so half the people weren't there, and, uh, it, it became a very casual competition, 
[02:19:00]  and I don't remember playing this gentleman, but I do remember the generator running out  of gas, but I can guarantee you that if it, if it hadn't, I would have kicked it.  Here's another thing.  Danny was working.  And probably drunk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what do you have to say for yourself now?  Probably definitely drunk.  I'm with Danny on this one, and I'll tell you why.  Uh, this guy's all talk, no action.  I mean, we get a, you know, the listener's showing up every day. 
[02:19:30]  This guy could have showed up with his guitar.  Does he have to say it?  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's disgusting.  You don't need an invite to check out the show.  You could have showed up with your guitar and surprised Danny with, hey, I was the guy  that I think, think, uh, was beating you at the, uh, at the PNC that day.  Yeah, I mean, I mean, shit, you have, you have time to, to register for a message board  and then write three fucking paragraphs about a video game.  I think you could fucking find the time to show up.  Yeah.  15 minutes.  You know, I gotta say.  If you're gonna, if you're gonna cause a big ruckus about it.  It's a big all talk, uh, no action thing. 
[02:20:00]  Of course.  Wearing his Iron Maiden shirt, Anthony.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah, I gotta go change.  Oh, that's right.  You're gonna be, uh, dressed as Billy Mitchell today.  Well, as close to Billy, as close to Billy Mitchell, my idol.  Right.  As I can get.  Yeah, Billy Mitchell.  Travis, Travis did me a very big favor.  He went out and got me, got me a nice red, white, and blue tie.  Nice.  In honor of my hero.  Yeah.  And I, I also went through the, uh, the old closet, and I found some, some nice tight-fitting jeans.  Very tight Billy Mitchell pants. 
[02:20:30]  Also, preferably worn by Billy.  Dude, you had, like, how short are your legs?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm like, I'm like a 34-16.  It's my pants size.  All right, so you're gonna dress as Billy Mitchell.  Evan just came in with his casual Iron Maiden, you know, I bought it yesterday, but it looks like  it's 20 years old t-shirt, right?  No, I got this at the show.  Oh, well, excuse me.  What happened?  That's right, Evan was at the garden.  Yeah.  And by the way, um, you know, David didn't believe in Danny, so he didn't show up today 
[02:21:00]  to hype Danny.  No.  Exactly, he quit.  Danny, it's looking a little rough for you today.  David is not here to hype you up, so I'm sure Anthony will certainly help you out.  Of course.  I didn't have time for a lot of practice yesterday.  But I will say.  Excuse this dark.  No.  That, you know, the last song that I did decide to practice on, I was five-starring very,  very difficult songs and doing very well.  All right.  I'm just basing this.  I'm not even a hype guy.  I'm just basing this on what I've seen. 
[02:21:30]  I've seen a lot of people play Guitar Hero, and, you know, I've seen Danny kick ass.  Let's hear from Evan.  Evan, how are you feeling today about this whole thing?  I broke my arm.  Can we postpone this?  No.  I'm feeling pretty good, but my attitude is to just take it as any other time I'd be playing  the game, rather than get all pumped up about it.  That's how I perform my best.  Are you nervous that there might be close to a million people listening to you play Guitar  Hero today?  Let's get right to the facts here. 
[02:22:00]  No, not really.  I think I got most of my nerves out yesterday.  You're not in a dorm room with a bunch of nerds.  I mean, this is a big time now.  This isn't Stony Brook, uh, fucking...  University.  It's not the cafeteria.  It's Stony Brook University.  Where was it held at Stony Brook?  It was actually in a common area in the dorm.  In the common...  In the dorm.  That's right.  The common...  The common area.  The commons in the dorm.  Yes, it worked out.  It's not just some room.  Shit, you must have been playing against tens of people in there.  Wait, I want to hear Sam, who's supporting Evan, work that angle.  Yeah.  You're not just going to some little dorm room, some little setup, some little corner of a bar. 
[02:22:30]  You're looking at a common room.  When you're on a floor of a dorm, you're talking about 10, 20, 30 rooms.  Where can all those students go?  To the common area.  Oh, sure.  All right.  Hey, I got an idea, because David is not here today, because some people felt like it wasn't  important enough to have David here for the big Guitar Hero match, but that's another  story for another day.  Yeah.  But people are suggesting that maybe we have a substitute hype man today. 
[02:23:00]  Really?  Ladies and gentlemen, where is Hank Tankerous?  Hank Tankerous?  Where is Hank Tankerous?  This is part of it.  Oh, it's actually, I'm being informed, it's actually Tank Tankerous.  I mean, Tank Tankerous, sure, you're right.  Hank Tankerous is...  Well, you're right, Tank Tankerous, but how could you remember a name?  Yeah, of course, Tank Tankerous.  Hank Tankerous.  Are you Hank Tankerous?  Great.  Hey, Tank.  Hey, Tank, how are you?  What's up, gentlemen?  Move it, faggot.  Oh, he pushed Evan out of the way, my God. 
[02:23:30]  Might have hurt his arm there.  Yeah, don't hurt the hand.  Don't hurt the hand.  So you, uh, could you hype up Danny for the big Guitar Hero match?  Some men are here today to play some Guitar Hero, but the man who stand amongst the rest,  whatever.  He stands amongst the rest?  Oh, you suck.  Yes.  Is Daniel J. Ross going to kick this little faggot's ass?  He's going to be, you're going to be experiencing face melters? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah?  On expert level, Danny's just going to blow the shit out of this game.  Good one.  Thank you very much.  Oh, Sam, comment?  What Tank fails to understand is, well, Danny is amongst the rest of the players.  He stands, he stands, he stands above the rest, which would make him the champion, not just  like everyone else.  Right, well, we all noticed the, uh...  Well, this is what you get for a last minute replacement.  Oh, yeah, that's, that's the problem. 
[02:24:30]  You suck.  That's the worst thing problem I've ever heard.  So stop casting Tank in here.  They're going to, we're going to, someone's going to, all right.  Yeah.  Hey, Tank, can you, uh, throw out maybe a rock scream to get the competition underway?  If you haven't had the rock scream in a while, Tank Ankerous with the rock scream.  Thank you very much.  Danny has left the studio to dress as Billy Mitchell for the competition. 
[02:25:00]  He's putting on, uh, it's like a tribute to Billy Mitchell, his hero.  Yeah.  His video game hero, who, uh, also, by the way, a lot of controversy, uh, follows, uh,  Billy Mitchell, but he is a true champion.  That's true.  We're not going to sit here and bash Billy Mitchell.  He's a true champion.  And like you were saying, though, the controversy had followed Danny's, uh, championship, uh,  run at PNC.  Uh, controversy is controversy.  It's going to, it's going to follow the true heroes are always going to be, uh, in, in, 
[02:25:30]  in, in, in, in controversy, the true players, Billy Mitchell is not, the stars, unplugging  generators and breaking the hopes and dreams of fans of the show, like plastic rocker.  Hey, don't go making allegations, false allegations.  No one unplugged anything.  It ran out of gas.  Just reading.  I'm just reading.  You got tank tankers here.  You don't need to hype Danny.  Oh, Tank.  Tank.  What do you have to say about that?  Wasn't there.  Didn't see the, uh, generator. 
[02:26:00]  What an asshole.  There's claims that Danny might have, uh, turned off the generator when he was losing  a Guitar Hero match at the PNC.  That's preposterous.  I'm smelling bullshit.  Yeah.  Daniel J. Ross would not stoop to those kind of shenanigans.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  That's like, bullshit.  Stop coming to tank hangers.  That's why we love tank hangers.  All right. 
[02:26:30]  Are we doing, uh, Through the Fire and the Flames?  A lot of the, uh, you know, the hardcore guitar hero guys out there want to know.  You doing, uh, did you do that one today, Evan?  I'll do whatever on the mic.  How well have you done that one?  Pretty good, actually.  Although that is probably the hardest song in the whole series.  It'll still five-star it, though.  It'll still five-star it.  Five-star it?  Really?  Yeah.  No five-star any song.  Really?  Yeah.  How do you know?  I've seen him play.  How many times have you seen him play?  I actually...  Why are you letting tank hangers off the hook, Ant? 
[02:27:00]  He left.  No, Ant, because he left, first of all.  And it doesn't matter what I say.  Two words out of his stupid mouth.  Tank, come here for a second.  We're talking about Through the Fire and Flame.  Could you please get on fucking Sam Roberts over there and maybe ask him how many times he's seen Evan play?  You heard the man?  What are you?  You're right, Ant. 
[02:27:30]  It's Billy Mitchell.  All right, it's Billy Mitchell.  Oh, are you a tool?  Let me get a picture of this.  By the way, I've got to find a good camera angle here.  Hold on.  Camera one, I think, is a good one.  Hold on.  Let me get a picture of this for Opie's eye.  Yeah, Opie's eye is back finally.  Let's get...  All right.  Wait, I've got to back up to get the horrible pants.  Go back afoot.  Yeah, Danny has showed back up in the studio as Billy Mitchell for the big Guitar Hero match. 
[02:28:00]  Beautiful.  All right.  Someone's saying, wait, isn't that Joni Mitchell?  His red, white, and blue tie.  He's got the much-too-tight pants.  Much, much-too-tight pants.  Yes, you are so Billy Mitchell.  Now, that will not affect your playing at all, will it?  No.  If anything, it'll help support me.  Oh, okay.  It's like an athletic supporter.  All right.  Being true athletes that we are with our plastic guitars. 
[02:28:30]  Yes.  So are we ready to do this or what?  I can't wait.  What are we doing?  We have to test it out, make sure it's up to everyone's liking?  I'm sure it'll be fine.  All right.  Are we pulling songs out of a hat?  Well, that's...  What have you guys figured out?  That's one thing I was trying to figure out.  It's because, I mean, I did bring four different Guitar Hero copies.  Okay.  So there's hundreds and hundreds of songs in there.  So we're going to have to somehow narrow this down.  Maybe just do some more hits.  Or if you guys have personal favorites or whatever. 
[02:29:00]  It's a lot of music.  You guys know the game best.  It's got to be...  What's going to work here?  Something difficult.  Maybe there's some songs that me and Danny can both agree on that we could throw out there.  Look at that.  That sounds good.  Wow.  You've got sportsmanship.  I like that.  Yeah.  I mean, that is really honorable.  I like you guys sportsmanship.  It's all right.  No, it's a ploy to blurt out...  What?  Oh, Tank?  You want to respond to his good sportsmanship? 
[02:29:30]  To Evan's good sportsmanship?  That faggot will play whatever Daniel J. Ross wants to play.  Jesus Christ.  It isn't even where I was going.  I know.  Holy shit.  That's why I'm doing this to you.  Oh, I know.  It's torturing me, too.  Why?  He's good.  He stinks.  That's why I'm doing this to you.  Tank Hankerous is a boob.  Tank Hankerous, it just says the same thing over and over again.  No offense.  I'll take it.  All right.  Are we doing Through the Fire and Flames, though, as the grand finale?  Where do we put that? 
[02:30:00]  It's a tough song.  Nah, he's a little scared.  He's a little scared.  Who plays it originally?  That is a...  What is it?  Avenged Seven?  No, no, it's not Avenged Seven.  Dragon Force.  Of course.  Yeah.  Actually, that was Evan.  Who said it first?  I don't know, because I'm not up on it like you guys, but that used to be the song.  Has there one come along that's even harder than that one?  They have been a difficult song since, but I think that remains the tops.  Do we do that as maybe a, I don't know, tiebreaker? 
[02:30:30]  That could be the third one, yeah.  Well, I don't know.  What do these guys think?  This song happens to be a big step above the rest.  Maybe this could be a winner's circle song, maybe, as like a final showcase for the winner.  Look at that.  He wants to keep performing after he wins.  No, no, he wants to not have that in the competition.  No, he wants to...  Is what he said.  If we're both playing, we both have the same handicap.  Tank, could you comment on that, please?  Yeah, what do you see going on here, Tank?  I see Evan acting a little chicken shit here and making excuses. 
[02:31:00]  No, he didn't.  Gee, thanks.  Well, I said before, Danny has the luxury of picking any song that he chooses, and I will,  without contest, go around with him.  I think at the very least, Through the Fire and Flame should be some kind of exhibition,  because we want to hear how well you guys would do that.  I think you should be part of the contest.  If it's such a tough one...  It is, it's up there.  It should be the tiebreaker, then, if need be, if you guys go one for one, because once  someone wins two songs, we're doing two out of three falls here.  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  Which is, obviously, three songs.  If somebody wins two, game over.  Should we do best of five?  Best of five?  What the fuck time you want to get out of here?  We have nothing else planned today.  I got plans.  I got plans.  Not going past 11.  Oh, no, I understand that.  Hot suckers.  I understand that.  You motherfuckers.  All right, let's get started, unless there's a reason I'll do it.  We'll take a quick break.  All right, we'll get to...  We'll take a quick break.  We'll decide on the songs.  Yes.  And when we come back, the big contest, the big Guitar Hero contest between Evan and 
[02:32:00]  our own Danny.  Mm-hmm.  Damn straight.  And Tank, anything before we go to break?  Hey, Evan, Seaman, champion, champion.  Oh, whatever it is.  I don't think that you have your own Guitar Hero champion cartoon.  Holy shit, look at that.  Even drawn as the man himself. 
[02:32:30]  Damn.  Who did that for you?  Zoll.  Everybody knows Zoll can't draw.  Everybody knows Zoll.  That's perfect.  Zoll rules.  It's my favorite.  Dude, that's perfect.  That's a very good drawing.  That right there, no.  You know, that shows respect for a man and his abilities.  Zoll doesn't know anything about Guitar Hero.  He can't draw.  He's no good at this stuff.  He needs to stick to posting or just watching.  Tank, what do you think?  Have it framed in my bathroom.  Love it. 
[02:33:00]  What?  What?  What?  What?  All right.  Well.  Tank Hankerus stinks.  All right.  Let's go calibrate some lag.  Yeah, let's go.  Let's do this and then the big match next.  Are we back?  Yes, we are.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Where are you guys?  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  I'm over here.  I'm over here now.  I'm over in now.  I'm near Danny and Evan getting ready for the big Guitar Hero match.  Opie and 2 isn't up, huh?  Damn it.  They have calibrated, Anthony.  Are they calibrated?  They're ready to go.  There's another chair over here if you guys want to see the action.  Where are we at, Danny?  We have to, because we have not played through.  Hold on.  Your mic's not on. 
[02:34:00]  I shouldn't have left my post.  I knew it.  You left your post.  Why would I leave my post?  You abandoned your post.  Sir.  Just because we have not run through the game.  You know, on this particular console, you know, we're just unlocking.  We're at the stage now where we're unlocking using a cheat code.  Unlocking all the songs so that we can pick from everything that the Guitar Hero does.  Why song?  Normally, yeah, you'd have to play and win.  Yeah, it's just an extremely long and elaborate code that you have to put, and it's very easily 
[02:34:30]  fucked up, so I'm going through it a few times.  That always sucks.  Have you been able to do the cheat code?  Still no?  Um, I think I was familiar with the, I never needed to use the cheat codes, so I'm not really  familiar with them, but I do recall having to use them on the PS2 version, but unfortunately  they are not the same.  All right.  That's him entering the code, by the way, because everybody's curious.  Sounds good. 
[02:35:00]  Sounds good.  It's like he's warming up.  That sounds really nice.  That is a weird way to enter a cheat code, isn't it?  Oh, the PC is so easy.  It's like console games.  If he screws up putting in the cheat code, someone hit him over the head with a guitar.  I can't tell shit, I already screwed it up once.  It's that hard? 
[02:35:30]  It's just so long and unnecessary.  Yeah, why would it just be one, two, three?  It sounds like what I wanted to do is...  They don't want you to cheat.  I wanted to bring in my own console, and like, I just, at the last minute, I was like,  oh, well, we have one there, what do I need mine for?  Or, I fucking should have brought it in.  Yeah, perhaps.  It didn't work?  Oh, boy, we got our first problem.  I seem to recall my wife having no problem entering this code multiple times.  Ah!  Well, is she here?  No!  Then shut up!  I don't know what your problem is.  Danny, you want to give it a try, or are we going to... 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, but I don't think it's really, like, for the radio.  Well, I know, but...  To listen to that again is awfully terrible and boring.  Well, what else are we going to do?  I mean, Sam could hype up his man.  Well, the bottom line is that Evan isn't going to be able to enter a cheat code correctly  because he's never done it before to any game, Guitar Hero or otherwise, whether it  be for PS2, Xbox, Nintendo DS, Atari.  Where's Tank Hankerous?  Tank!  There's no way to do this just with a controller, or... 
[02:36:30]  It's hysterical.  This is a controller.  They have to just do it with a fucking guitar to put in cheat codes.  You should see how long this cheat code thing is, and I'm looking at it as Danny attempts  it again.  It's a nightmare.  There's no reason for it, right?  It's harder than the game.  Yeah.  You might as well just play the game.  You just got it.  Fuck.  Did you get it, Danny?  No.  Fuck.  I'm doing what it says.  Danny failed, too.  You hit the thing and put God mode, and then that's it. 
[02:37:00]  You know, I still remember those old doom codes.  Fucking doom codes.  I-D-D-Q-D.  Yeah.  Unlimited ammo.  Are we double-checking to make sure we have the right code?  Yes.  Yes.  Do you want to call your wife, Travis?  Already a clusterfuck, ladies and gentlemen.  Here at the Guitar Hero Championship.  Yeah.  2009.  Right.  We are trying to put in the cheat codes so they could unlock the hard songs, so they  could actually compete and not play pussy songs. 
[02:37:30]  Well, where's Tank Hankerous?  I feel like the longer people wait for it.  He's putting in his eat code.  Tank.  Tank Hankerous.  Can you turn this on?  Okay.  Yes.  All right.  Wrong headphones.  Oh, shit.  You put on the future losers' headphones.  Who, Danny's?  No.  Good one.  Evan was using those headphones.  Evan, of course. 
[02:38:00]  Tank Hankerous.  Yeah.  It's awful.  It stinks.  Have you been following what's been going on here?  It's a shame.  It should have been done ahead of time.  I don't know what's with some of the staff here.  I'm blaming possibly your executive producer on this one.  And you can't get in trouble because you're in character right now.  That is true, and we're on the air.  So you're blaming Steve.  Why are you blaming Steve?  This should have been set up and ready to go when the show came over from CBS. 
[02:38:30]  That could be true that this should have been set up.  I don't know whose responsibility that would be.  I'll take the hit for that.  Why?  Danny's going to take the hit.  You can't take the hit.  You're one of the competitors.  It's going to be like a fucking 12-minute situation to try and put in a fucking cheat code for a video game.  So I will definitely...  Steve probably assumed they knew what they were doing.  I'll say, as the character of Primetime Sam Roberts, I would also think it would be Steve's responsibility.  There you go.  We got it.  We got it.  We were doing it wrong.  Oh, boy. 
[02:39:00]  Wait, we might have it now?  No.  I see...  It came up.  It said unlock everything.  That's Rolling Stones.  It's called the game, asshole.  I see Evan gets very upset.  Evan's also got a squint going.  I think he might have some eyesight problems looking at the screen.  There's no eyesight problem.  That's a glare.  All right.  We're getting ready to go, Ed.  There's no way to pull up N2.  Are we going to get the screen up?  There's another chair over here if someone wants to see the action.  Danny, so what do we got going on here? 
[02:39:30]  We're ready to go?  We're definitely ready.  We are going to play three songs, right?  One of my choice, one of his choice.  And then I guess what we're doing, firing the planes for a third song.  So, me being the sportsman that I am, I will let the first choice go to my competitor.  Ooh.  Evan, come here for a second.  What song are you going to pick for the first song of the Guitar Hero match here?  I'm not sure.  I'm going to peruse the list and see if anything catches my eye.  Take your time, champion.  Take your time.  Champion.  All right, Ed, he's looking around, looking for his first song. 
[02:40:00]  Not...  Dragon Force is not here, unfortunately.  Is it okay if I stand here while you're playing?  What do you think?  Evan, what do you think?  He's looking for a song.  Yeah, I see him.  Well, we're already doing Cliffs of Dover, right?  Yeah, let's catch him.  Okay, let's do Cliffs of Dover.  All right, so he's doing Cliffs of Dover.  Both you guys are.  Evan, pick the first song.  First song, best out of three, Anthony.  Here we go.  First song, best out of three, Cliffs of Dover. 
[02:40:30]  Evan versus Danny.  Ready to go.  Oh, we have a Guitar Hero Challenge intro from Derek, if you want to hear that first.  Yeah, let's hear that.  He spent at least ten minutes on it, so we should give it a spin here for everybody.  We've got an official intro and everything.  Go ahead, Travis.  Okay, we're going to do the rock and roll now.  It's the Opie and Anthony Guitar Hero Challenge between Daniel Jason Ross and the Fireman Evan  Champion, who happens to be an intern.  You wanted the best, but they didn't fucking make it. 
[02:41:00]  The Opie and Anthony Guitar Hero Challenge.  The Opie and Anthony Guitar Hero Challenge.  Guitars with colorful buttons on them.  Wow.  That's a great intro.  This is exciting.  Thank you, Derek and Steve.  All right, we're ready to go, Ant.  Best of three.  This is unbelievable.  Our first one ever.  This is going to prove it right here.  They're loading.  The game is loading, as I've seen. 
[02:41:30]  They're both standing there.  Competition is about to begin.  All right, here we go.  Head-to-head competition, Anthony.  Eric Johnson's Cliffs of Dover.  Yeah.  I'm on the right.  I'm on the right.  There it is.  Of course you are. 
[02:42:00]  Who's stuck in the ass?  Danny's sweating.  Danny's behind right now, Ant.  Of course he is.  Danny's playing smoke on the water.  Evan's got a sizable lead right now, Anthony.  Look at how cocky Evan looks right now.  Look at how sure of himself he is.  Yeah, he's tapping his feet.  He's just dancing.  He's just dancing.  Yeah, he's having a ball.  Man, this nervous intern, he was real nervous yesterday,  talking about just basic shit,  but now he's very, very confident. 
[02:42:30]  The fireman's got rhythm.  He's in the zone.  Danny's making a comeback, though, Ant.  It's a bit closer.  How do they do this?  Danny has taken the lead, Anthony.  Yes.  Danny has taken the lead, but it's very, very close.  35,000, Evan.  35,000, Danny.  Evan is going back and forth.  It's really tough to see who's winning. 
[02:43:00]  Danny's got a lead right now.  Pretty good lead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's make sure the wiring's good.  Wow.  I don't know what the fuck's happening.  Evan has taken the lead, but very, very close.  It's back and forth again, Anthony.  Yeah.  Back and forth.  Evan has a nice little lead right now.  He does?  Yes, he does.  Of course he does.  I've never gotten car sick watching a video game before. 
[02:43:30]  I feel like I'm being attacked by it.  Oh, that was good.  Danny has taken the lead.  Back from Evan.  This is back and forth.  It's really close.  Evan actually moves his head and acts like he's in concert.  Danny's lead is growing, Anthony.  It's growing a bit.  People are saying Evan looks like Jet Travolta.  Okay.  Just adding that in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow. 
[02:44:00]  Evan just jumped ahead big time.  There's a lot of little notes there.  Evan had a nice spurt there, Anthony.  This is a very close.  But now it's getting back to very close, yes.  Is it hard to read a book while you play this?  Very, very close.  Evan just hit a 50-note streak.  So did Danny.  Yeah.  Right behind him with a 50-note streak.  Behind. 
[02:44:30]  Here comes the lead.  Here comes the lead.  Evan, a 100-note streak.  Evan's got a nice little lead right now, Ian.  Evan's got a sizable lead. 
[02:45:00]  Does he?  Yes, he does.  Oh, look at that.  Star power ready, baby.  Well, they're both smoking on the star power.  Yeah.  It's 157,000.  Wow.  Wow.  I don't know how they know when they fuck up.  I can see little explosions on the end of the guitar and monsters on a stage. 
[02:45:30]  It's very embarrassing for Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Anthony.  Hey, how did you stop pushing the button?  Evan won the first song.  Sizably.  What was the score?  What was the score?  It went away already.  Guaranteed. 
[02:46:00]  No, he beat me definitely.  I fucked up so fucking bad.  Yeah.  Now, why did you fuck up?  Look at that.  Wait, it was 100 and...  Because I've had no sleep and no practice, and I haven't played this game in seven fucking  months.  Man, excuses.  Excuses.  Wow.  You just saw that yesterday.  I can guarantee you...  More early on on the show.  I can guarantee that my high score at my house is much bigger than his high score.  All right.  Why don't you tape the score?  Why don't you tape the score, Billy?  Why don't you tape the score and send it in?  Tape it.  Because that screen says 180,588 to 146,890. 
[02:46:30]  Not even false.  Wait, go back to that.  Evan hit 90% of his notes.  Boom.  I hit 87.  And Danny hit 87%.  Did you hit that performance for me, too?  I've never seen Danny go below 95.  Look at that.  I fucked up.  I fucked up, like, the core of my star power phrases, and that's the only reason why he  got a size of the lead up.  He said it wasn't going to happen again, and it's happening again.  He said it wasn't going to happen again, and it is.  Uh, Ted Kankeris, your guy didn't look too good there. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, quit crying like a baby and kick this faggot's ass.  Wow, he's some tough one.  Okay.  Some tough love there.  Yeah, certainly.  Thanks, The Motivator.  Well, uh, Evan's one song away from winning the big Guitar Hero match competition here.  And it's only going to take one more.  What song are we picking for the second song?  I'm not sure.  It's up to me, but, I mean, I want to make some fun.  Why don't you pick Slow Rock?  Here's the big comeback.  It's too easy.  No.  Yes. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  He changed his tune.  What the fuck, man?  I'm pissed off because, like, I know I'm not in my game, man.  I'm pissed off.  That no fucker cannot be, I, dude, I saw his performance.  This is Slash all over again.  I know.  Champions don't get angry.  I saw him play.  He can't play.  I could do much better than this.  But you didn't.  I've never, I've never seen Danny dip below 90 fucking five on a percent.  It doesn't matter.  We're here.  We're playing.  I've seen it happen.  I've seen it happen.  It just did.  I'm sure George Foreman thought if I would have hit Ollie harder, he would have got knocked 
[02:48:00]  out and not me.  That's right.  Uh, maybe it's the really tight Billy Mitchell pants that's throwing Danny off.  Well, can we look at the way, uh, Evan holds his guitar to compare to the way, Evan wears  his guitar more like a necklace.  Yeah.  Yes.  Whereas Danny has the traditional hanging guitar.  Yes.  I was going to go with even flow because it was fun.  Yeah.  Evan holds it like Roy Orbison.  All right.  Even flow.  Evan, uh, beats Danny.  It's over.  Yeah.  It's over.  Here we go.  All right.  Cool.  The little guitars are back up. 
[02:48:30]  Here we go.  The guitars are coming.  We'll let them establish before we tell you it was leading.  Yeah.  It's a little early.  It's pretty close.  Okay.  One of them is up.  One of them is still up.  Yep.  The guy is still up.  Danny's got an early lead, Anthony.  Early lead has, they worked their way through even flow by Pearl Jam. 
[02:49:00]  And it's coming back.  All right.  Here come the notes.  One.  That's right.  Danny holding on to a slim lead, Anthony.  Very slim.  Very slim.  It's all right.  Very tough game.  Wow.  I could play this game for exactly four seconds before breaking it.  Danny's, uh, rocking a pretty big lead. 
[02:49:30]  Yep.  All right.  This is the biggest lead Danny has, has had in the competition.  Yeah, he's fucked up a star power.  I don't know what that means.  All I know is that Austin, they have to last time extended.  Evan's fighting back a little bit, but Danny definitely holding on to his lead.  He's coming back.  Evan is coming back.  I've seen this before.  Nah, nah.  I like the long, though.  Danny's got it.  Danny's in the zone right now, Ant. 
[02:50:00]  Yep.  Hold it on to the lead.  Danny's Billy Mitchell costume is going to look awfully silly if he doesn't win.  Just concentrate.  Danny's got it.  Danny's still in the lead.  Danny's lead's a little more slender than it was.  Yeah, slightly.  Lead not changing too much, eh?  All right, a little star power.  Danny needs to tank hankerous that lead, which means fatten it up. 
[02:50:30]  Danny's getting a bigger lead right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Where are we at on this one, fireman?  You relax.  Whoa, that was a big section for Evan.  It is close.  Evan has taken the lead.  There he is.  There's the fireman.  There's the fireman.  There's the fireman.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Down goes Danny.  Evan has taken a big lead.  How did that happen?  He holds out that fire that Danny was on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Evan likes to hang back and wait for the competition to trip. 
[02:51:00]  And then he trousers.  Evan on a 100-note streak.  Yeah, of course he is.  Anthony hit, uh, Danny hit a 50-note streak.  Danny.  But now Danny's side's on fire.  Is that good or bad?  It's good.  It's good.  Okay.  There's electricity on his side.  Oh, Danny.  Yeah.  Evan's still holding on to his lead.  We're getting close to the end here.  I don't know how he knows when he's fucked up.  I don't know.  Oh, there's a lot of flames on Evan's side. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, there's a lot of electricity, Elton.  That's why they call him the fireman.  Evan pulling away, Ant.  Pulling away.  Oh, man.  It's not even closed anymore.  Yes.  Evan has a calm...  What happened?  What happened?  No.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What the fuck?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Where's the referee?  Wait, what happened? 
[02:52:00]  Where's the referee?  Holy shit, Anthony.  What happened?  Evan was in the lead.  Evan was in the lead.  No, what happened?  Evan was kicking his ass.  He was destroying him.  And then Xbox lost power.  Dude, I came over...  Steve, he turned off the fucking machine.  Where have you been?  I came over to look...  Oh, Danny throwing down his guitar.  I came over to look at the monitor.  Oh, my God.  He's turning into Pete Townsend.  You were supposed to help, Danny.  Now, Danny's pissed that you took...  No, no, I came over to look at the monitor and something fell out of the... 
[02:52:30]  Well, the plug fell out.  It fell out of the machine when I came in to look at the monitor.  Is that bad that that happened?  I don't know what happened.  That was Evan's match to win.  What?  That was Evan's match to win.  Evan had a huge lead.  No, Danny was...  But Danny seems to be pissed off that Anthony pulled the plug on the Xbox.  I'm not pissed at the plug.  It fell out when I walked by.  It looked like I pulled it.  No, no, I'm pissed at this fucking kid.  He really thinks that he's better than me at this game.  And he might...  He might have been...  He might have been...  All right, you know what?  I'm over here.  I can throw all your fucking mics off.  So, he might think... 
[02:53:00]  Oh, yeah?  He might think that now.  Oh, yeah, you're on the wireless.  I got the super powerful microphone.  Dude, I'm watching him play.  He's missing a fuckload of notes.  I'm missing him, too.  But I'm working on five hours of sleep in two days.  But you knew the competition was here today.  I will only say this, Danny.  He's a nervous wreck.  He's not used to being on the air, so...  No, no.  Danny had it.  Believe me.  That plug didn't fall out.  There's nothing more than I wanted to do than practice for eight hours yesterday  just so I could just destroy this fucking kid who's talking shit. 
[02:53:30]  But I didn't have the time.  So, I didn't...  I just couldn't do it.  Hey, how much did you practice, Evan?  How much?  You're sounding like a sore loser right now, Danny.  I don't give a fuck.  He didn't lose anything.  The game somehow fucked up.  Well, if we can't get this Xbox back on, Evan wins because he's in the league.  It's true.  Evan hasn't played in two weeks.  It doesn't work that way.  I haven't played in six months.  You played yesterday for 20 minutes.  Jimmy's a big fight fan like myself.  Can you imagine Muhammad Ali talking like Danny's talking right now? 
[02:54:00]  What do you say right now?  This sounds like it was an old-fashioned shellacking.  Something.  It was a mechanical problem.  Oh, shit.  And obviously, they would have to do it again at some time.  How about turning back on and doing that really tough song?  Well, first comes first, Steve needs to get to the bottom of exactly what happened to that Xbox  because something fell out.  Look, it fell out there, too, at the box.  How would you know that?  Did you notice that while you were right over there close to it? 
[02:54:30]  I went over, and I saw it fall out, and I had to come back here and report that it had fallen out  because I wanted to see the screen to see if he was actually winning, and, wow, I never expected that to happen.  I guess the cheat code's got to be put back in, huh?  Thanks, Sam.  That's 12 more fucking minutes.  Evan, do you want to put the cheat code in?  Yeah, I think I can.  All right, you'll obviously get on the first time.  Yeah, of course Evan's got it.  Of course he does.  Right, Sam?  I'm stunned that that could happen. 
[02:55:00]  What, that Danny could actually lose?  No, that there was a mechanical problem right at the end there because Danny was coming back.  There was definitely a win in that one for Danny.  It would have gone to the third song.  No, it wouldn't have.  No, it was definitely going to the third song.  It would have gone to the third song if Evan had handed his guitar to Dick Clark and said,  I'd also like to know what Anthony was doing over there.  That was very convenient timing.  No, I was looking.  I told you I was looking at the monitor.  I can't see the score up here on the screen, so I wanted to see it. 
[02:55:30]  Hold on, a communication from Master Poe.  I think Anthony pulled out the plug.  Yeah, what did Steve say?  What happened?  What fell out?  What happened was fell out.  I just got yelled at for bringing that up on the air.  Why are you yelling at Sam for bringing that up?  Now, you know what?  I'm actually executive producing and trying to find out where our phoner with Joe Rogan is going.  And so my head was down.  God, everyone has excuses today.  It's not an excuse. 
[02:56:00]  It's actually a legitimate reason.  We have excuses.  So Shitstirer over here decides to bring it up.  You slapped the microwave for me while I was on the air.  Yeah, I would have slapped your face, but I'm actually restrained.  It's a violence.  That's a good one, Steve.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  It's a fucking habit with you.  Thank you.  And it will continue to be.  Thank you.  Good one.  It will continue to be.  I can't argue that logic.  This rocks.  The whole show is falling apart.  Really.  A lot of toxic energy in here.  It's good.  We ought to all get out of Verizon. 
[02:56:30]  All right, listen.  I'm faced idiots.  What are we going to do?  We're putting the cheat code back in?  Yes, Evan will do it.  Put the cheat code back in, and then they could start that song again if they want.  It just, you know, if we could keep the mechanical problems to a fucking minimum.  Oh, I don't know what happened.  The cord fell out.  I told you.  I've never seen it.  Thank God I was close enough to see what happened.  I've never seen a cord fall out.  And what were you saying?  I came over to see it.  No, no, but you're hoping for what?  No mechanical difficulties.  All right, good.  Master Paul, make sure you watch Anthony for the next ten minutes. 
[02:57:00]  Uh-oh.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Because I've never seen a cord fall out of an Xbox on its own.  I didn't either.  That's what shocked me.  I was looking at the score, and I just saw it fall out, and I had to run back to the  mic and go, oh, my God.  The cord fell out.  We need a referee.  We're doing the same song, do-over.  I would say do another one.  What do you want to do, Danny?  Well, that first song should still count.  Yes, it does.  Well, of course.  And that next one.  Don't be silly.  Evan, did you write that second one?  You played it so well. 
[02:57:30]  I think that's kind of cheating.  I think it's only fair.  I mean, if he did have a lead, it's only fair.  I'm getting a communique from the TMZ kid.  He writes, down goes Danny.  Wow.  Down goes Danny.  Tell that TMZ kid.  If he steals one more of my lines than I just did five minutes ago, I'll do nothing about it.  We're going to restart the contest.  All right.  What are we doing now?  It's going to be, we're going to do Evenflow.  Evenflow again.  All right.  All right.  All right.  They're going to do the same song.  Okay.  Someone checked Danny's pants for foreign objects. 
[02:58:00]  No controversy.  There's some wrestling shenanigans happening.  There's a rock.  Here comes the guitar.  Danny is sitting down.  Apparently the standing thing wasn't working for him.  So he's now Jose Feliciano.  Oh, good.  More any better.  Yeah.  He got some star power.  100-note streak for both of them.  Yeah.  It's pretty much tied, Anthony. 
[02:58:30]  Yep.  There goes Danny.  A little star power.  There also goes Danny.  Yep.  It's still too close to call.  It's too close.  No one's really pulling away yet.  200-note streak for both guys.  Yep.  Yeah.  It will continue.  It's raining green fire.  Go fire, man.  I don't know why that happens. 
[02:59:00]  It's still too close to call, Eric.  Star power ready, baby.  All right.  300-note streak for both guys.  First time we're seeing this during the competition.  That's right.  One of the first times it's ever happened in a competition.  This is very close now.  I want to play this, so we'll just keep going.  Two-note streak.  One-note streak.  Star power ready for Danny. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  There goes Danny.  Danny has a bunch of electricity on his side.  Evan's got a slight lead.  What?  Actually, Evan's pulling away.  Yeah.  Evan's pulling away.  How'd that happen?  That's the point.  Get over to your hand thing.  No, I'm not going to do it.  Yeah, he's not going to do it.  How would I do that?  Why would it come?  Do the lead, do the lead.  Evan's still got a lead. 
[03:00:00]  A sizable lead.  110 to 134.  All right.  Evan's still holding his lead.  It's all right.  Danny's coming back.  Yep.  Not fast enough.  Danny's playing like one of the layouts.  145 to 128.  Plus the thousands.  It's the way Evan holds his guitar that makes us hate him. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Evan holding on to his lead.  Barely.  It's getting closer.  Not that close.  Evan's got star power ready.  100-note streak for Evan.  Evan pulling away a little bit.  200-note streak for Danny. 
[03:01:00]  There we go.  Tall lead.  Evan holding on to his lead.  Danny kind of...  It's your turn.  Evan is really doing well.  Danny apparently feels that potty language is incorporated in the competition.  Yeah, he's a person.  I do not concur.  Oh, Evan's shaking his hand. 
[03:01:30]  He's kind of like scratching his side.  He's very casual and relaxed, this kid.  So much for piano.  Yeah, it's 220, 8,295.  Evan's got a sizable lead.  Yeah.  We have a toy we describe as an old-fashioned shellac.  Nobody wants to be select. 
[03:02:00]  Not over yet.  It's just about, though.  Evan is way far out.  This Evan's the best guitar hero player I've ever seen.  Anthony might owe me a hundred plus from yesterday.  I didn't really make that bet.  Oh. 
[03:02:30]  Me neither.  Oh, you suck.  Yeah, he has star power.  I don't know what that means.  Might be a little too late, Jimmy.  Might be.  I don't know what it means.  Let's see what happens.  Evan's on a 4,000-note streak.  370,000.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, boy.  I've said before, this game comes down to star power phrases.  And if you miss one, it's fucking, it's the end.  Yeah.  I think it comes down to skill.  And that's why they call him Evan Champion.  310,000.  Evan hit 99%.  Anthony, uh, uh, Danny, excuse me, hit, what, 98%?  98%.  There you go.  Evan's the big video game champion of the world.  That's right.  Good job.  Oh.  Fuck that.  Oh, boy.  Evan Champion.  Someone's a sore loser.  Someone's a very sore loser. 
[03:03:30]  Someone has a lot of shit going on in the fucking Guitar Hero competition.  It's the least of their problems.  I understand that.  But, you know, it's like when I would lose Parcheesi.  I one time lost a Parcheesi card.  And that Wilkerson boy suffered third-degree burns on his face and chest.  People said I was a sore loser.  How stupid is it for an intern to fucking win over the guy that tells you what to do?  You'd think he would have thrown it.  You'd be nice cleaning fucking toilets with a toothbrush.  D-Rock, where's your toothbrush?  Thank you. 
[03:04:00]  It'll volunteer for the toothbrush.  Thanks, man.  Oof.  No, no.  I guess, you know, took it.  Wow, silence here.  It's a very somber mood.  We've put the critics to rest.  I think some of us are very happy.  I think we're of equal skill.  Equal?  Yeah.  I will say this, though.  It was close.  I haven't found the competition that I would like to play, and I do believe Danny.  Oh, Jesus.  Son of a gentleman.  Stop your condescending bullshit. 
[03:04:30]  Well, I'll tell you what.  It's condescending.  I would say he is by far the best competitor I've ever played against.  Well, let's do this, because now I'm kind of pissed off, because no one fucking beats me.  No, I'll beat me.  Evan Champion.  So, how about...  Let's say...  I mean, it can't be too ridiculously far in the future, but let's say...  Read it now.  Let's say a month.  Let me get back to where I was, like, a year and a half ago, where I was kicking the fucking shit out of Asian kids.  The Fallen Champion.  Let me have fucking two nights sleep in a row.  Right.  And I will fucking kick the shit out of you. 
[03:05:00]  That's what we're talking about.  Why did you agree to this competition if you have so much going on in your personal life?  Because I figured, like every other guitar hero, fuck twat.  They're always just talking all the shit, and then you fucking play them, and they suck.  And he's the champion.  I didn't say Evan fuck twat.  I said Evan Champion.  Oh, shit.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  I got my semantics mixed up there.  This is...  Oh, wow.  I'm dumbfounded.  Yeah.  I'm outraged.  You're also a cheater.  I didn't cheat.  I don't know what happened with that first, uh...  I told you. 
[03:05:30]  The chord fell out, and thank God I was there to see it.  Do we have video of Anthony cheating?  I don't think so.  I really wanted to...  I hit the wrong button, but I wanted to compare stats, where it breaks down each section of  the song by how many notes.  Because I know I missed, like...  I missed, like, two fucking killer notes.  Yeah.  And, like, it was key.  Like, the reason he had a sizable lead against me was because that enabled him to get star power,  and then, obviously, if I miss a star power phrase, I have to wait for the next one.  Meanwhile, he's already one whole phrase ahead of me.  Meanwhile, he could double his multiplier from four to eight, therefore doubling... 
[03:06:00]  Danny, don't look at it.  So you could miss three notes and have a score difference of at least 40,000.  Exactly.  Don't look at the instant feedback, because I've never seen wah spelled so many times on instant feedback.  Oh, no.  There's a lot of wahs going on.  A lot of wahs.  It's important to read the feedback.  Like, well...  Whatever.  What do you want me to say?  Just say, look, you whine, it happens. 
[03:06:30]  You don't...  And I like the fact the intern is trying now to make his life easier, going, you know what?  Of all the people I've massacred...  No, look, Jimmy, I swear to God, I'm not good at anything.  I am not good at any fucking thing.  Isolate that.  This fucking game I am good at, goddammit.  I'm good.  It's the one fucking thing.  Can I have it, please?  But you're not the best.  But you're not the best.  Maybe the third time we try this, you'll prove it.  No, forget it.  No, no, it's fucking...  Hey, look, it's not the only thing you're good at.  Danny's putting too much of his self-esteem on this worthless game. 
[03:07:00]  The bottom line is there are a lot of things that Evan would better at you than.  Not just this particular source of humiliation.  I gave up playing this because it bored the fucking hell out of me.  Yeah.  So I haven't played it.  He's young and excited.  Yeah, well, don't read the instant feedback.  What's it saying?  I don't care.  Let them say whatever the fuck they want to say.  It's right here.  Oh, I'm a cry...  Happy butt thinks I'm a crybaby.  Jim Jones.  Mike saying, except that I fail...  Hold on, hold on.  Jim Jones, oh my God.  Nerd bot, stop your crying.  Call the wah-bulence for Danny.  Danny's a girly man.  Yeah?  I'm at work.  What are you doing? 
[03:07:30]  Nerd bot.  Danny is the guitar hero.  How a black girl is to hanging pictures.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, I think maybe Dragon Force might be the ultimate test.  He wants to do it again.  Billy Mitchell checking in and saying, please take off my tie.  Oh, no.  You didn't even get a chance to type USA in the scoreboard.  Danny equals crybaby.  Whatever.  Oh, shit.  I, um...  I'm flabbergasted. 
[03:08:00]  I know.  Danny's going to be playing like Guitar Hero in the Rain, and Blythe Danner is going to  have to tell the sun.  That's his way of saying that he has to practice now to beat you.  How far do I have to go to get a landing on your great Santini reference?  Hey, you missed that note, sports friends.  Spike W. from New Hampshire.  He says, Opie, can you go online to see what that wine is worth?  Wine.com.  Oh, no.  Jesus, you're a brave man. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, Jesus.  That was such a dick.  Let's go to the phones and say hi to Lady Trucker again.  Lady Trucker.  Danny?  Yeah?  What does that even mean?  Well, you know, we could have Andrew.  Ah, shotgun.  Great.  Well, you know what, Lady Trucker, let me tell you something.  You know how you call in every day for every show?  Half the time I just put you on hold and I don't even put your name up.  So now we can hang up on Lady Trucker because she never has anything to say.  Fucking go get some more hemorrhoids.  All right. 
[03:09:00]  Give her a break.  Brad in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Anthony, you were basically the guy that flew into the ropes with a parachute during Riddick,  Bowen, Holyfield.  Nice job.  Why?  Yeah.  Why?  There's the reference.  I, like I said, I walked over.  The cord fell out.  I came back here to report.  You were like Captain Lou Albano or something.  Why?  Yeah.  Who was it?  Who?  The Great Wizard?  The Grand Wizard.  The Grand Wizard.  Right.  I like that name.  Yes.  That's what I was going for.  Brandon, Oklahoma.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[03:09:30]  Hey, man.  Hey, why don't you guys, I've seen Danny's achievements.  The man is awesome at Guitar Hero.  All you can do is pull up his achievements.  He's got like a thousand-note streak.  It tracks all that.  And he hasn't played in forever.  I mean, if you look on there, it says the last time he played.  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Ross.  But that was all part of the hype portion of the competition.  Today, the competition went down.  What does Billy Mitchell say about live competition?  You've got to do it live.  You've got to do it live.  You've got to do it live.  Well, what did I say?  Let's go home and look at what I did.  I said, let's do it a month and I'll fucking practice. 
[03:10:00]  You did say that your high score at home is probably better.  I did, but I didn't say that that was going to be an official record.  It's not the be-all, end-all of Guitar Hero.  Good boy.  What a gentleman.  What a gentleman.  Yeah, Sonny from Dog Day Afternoon is trying to make me feel better.  Hey, you know, you tried to do what you had to do.  Well, let's go to the phones.  It just wasn't your day.  Rick in St. Louis.  Rick.  Hey, man, I hope Danny goes back and looks at the replay and understands how much of a tool he sounds like complaining about being kicked in the ass on a video game. 
[03:10:30]  Rick, I don't give a shit what you think.  Why don't you fags learn how to play a real guitar?  I do.  We do.  You ass.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You got a gank.  Let's go to Miles in Minnesota.  Miles.  Hey, Danny.  What?  You sound just like Steve when Steve's out in the meltdown.  I mean, identical to him, bro. 
[03:11:00]  What the fuck?  Look.  Ooh.  Ooh.  That's mean.  You know what they say when you don't give a shit.  That means you really do.  Ooh.  Let's go to Footer.  Footer.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Danny, you are the upper cuckold guitar here.  You're definitely prepping.  Cool.  A cuckold guitar.  You know what?  I think it's been a record.  I think it's been years since I've been this far into the fucking shit, getting my ass handed  to me by everyone on every level. 
[03:11:30]  So, I had quite a streak there.  So, I'll just accept that.  Let's go to Anthony in New York.  Anthony.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a competitor.  These guys are average players.  I will bring a competitor in for Anthony to challenge this Evan that doesn't even need  to look to screen to play the game.  We're not saying that we could play it blindfolded.  It was just a skill versus skill.  Who plays it blindfolded?  Well, I will say Evan could probably play blindfolded.  Shut it.  I'll say I'll put Evan on the line.  Are there people out there that do this blindfolded? 
[03:12:00]  Evan does.  Evan?  I have my guy.  I'll turn his head and write a note to you.  All right.  Well, Evan says he can do it.  He can say he can do it.  He can do it blindfolded.  Who is this fantasy man?  We'll bring him in.  Anthony, you are not a worthy competitor.  Wait.  You got a guy that can do this blindfolded and beat Evan?  Absolutely.  Let's bring him in.  Anthony, I never said I could play fucking blindfolded.  Oh, you can't play looking at it. 
[03:12:30]  I can't play.  If I beat you, I beat the shit out of you.  I don't play that game.  That's why I got my man.  That's when I shut the fuck up.  That's how you know Danny is mad.  When he goes, you can't even play that game.  He goes, yes, I can.  My favorite was Danny saying, I don't care, followed with a lot of screaming.  I carry it.  And then he's because, man, I'm fucking tired, man.  Listen to the roof right, dude.  If anyone knows.  And then he dropped his guitar on the phone on the floor.  He goes, I don't care, then.  All hell broke.  Danny, what's wrong? 
[03:13:00]  Come on.  I like to bed at 2.30 in the morning.  I've seen Danny just shred that thing.  Three, I beat you.  Yeah, okay.  So we're both tired.  So what's the matter?  Why are you upset?  Relationship trouble, real life?  All right.  No, his intern fucking shithead just fucking beat him.  Anybody's going to get upset when they get beat like that, but it's to be expected when  the fireman is on duty.  The fireman.  There's a couple more, then we'll move on.  Rich in Connecticut.  Rich.  Hey, Danny.  Why?  I used to be really good at electronic Simon Says when I was a kid. 
[03:13:30]  You want to go?  Oh, brother.  Let's go to Bastard, the trucker.  Bastard.  Hey, Danny, I got a truckload of dildos if you want to suck some more.  Wow.  Why would I waste all those delicious things in my mouth?  Yeah.  Let's go to Kurt in Los Angeles.  We need tank hankers, by the way.  Bring a tank.  Do we really?  Where are we?  Kurt, Los Angeles.  Go ahead.  Danny, oh, I'm not good at anything. 
[03:14:00]  Please do it real to me, Danny.  Fucking listeners are assholes.  They rule Danny.  Danny, Utah.  Yeah, I just want to say, Anthony is the Robbie Knievel of New Year's Jumps.  You should have said a guitar hero.  Because Robbie Knievel is the Robbie Knievel of New Year's Jumps.  You stink.  You fucking canker sore of a man.  Danny, I love you, but I got to read these.  Gino in Philly writes, how about Danny compete with Fez in a wah showdown? 
[03:14:30]  Hey, I do my crying off the air.  That's the difference, right?  Aren't we doing Through the Flames and the Fires and whatever the fuck that song is called?  Well, why?  Why bother?  The true champ has been fucking...  I think the champion should get the stage and be able to just...  He said he wants to do a winner's circle jerk, so let's do it.  Let's do it for that.  It is a game, and it's mostly for amusement.  Set up that song.  I know it's a long one, so what we'll do is we'll start the song, and then we'll go to  break, and we'll see how you did with it.  Because a lot of people would probably...  Are they playing against each other, though? 
[03:15:00]  No, he's going to...  We're going to give him the stage.  This was, for a while, the hardest song.  I don't know if there's a hard song.  I have no idea.  I lost track.  But a lot of people would love to know how you would score on that song.  How long of a song is it?  I think it's like nine minutes or so.  I'm 70 minutes.  Holy Toledo.  What's your highest percentage?  I think I might have broken 85 once.  On that one?  No, he's really...  See, I honestly think that we're very similarly talented.  Almost.  Being modest.  He's being very modest. 
[03:15:30]  I saw him get to 100%.  I haven't hit 85 on Fire and Flames, but I've cracked 80, definitely.  Us only playing two songs is not an accurate game.  Yes, it is.  It's either of our skills.  You played three.  Stop trying to be humble.  Evan wants a good internship.  He knows what this means after the mics go off.  His fucking...  The fact that his hair looks like Frankenberry and he's trying to be fucking polite makes  me sick.  Stop trying to be polite.  Well, there's a good question coming in from Greg in Georgia.  Greg? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  I was going to see if the fireman was going to take Danny's place.  It's being happy to be drinking, buddy.  That's a very good question.  Will Evan now be your new drinking buddy?  Yeah.  I'm the fuck out of here.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Uh, maybe Danny'd feel better if he talked to his mom.  Oh, oh, oh no.  Oh, that's right.  They don't talk.  All right.  They're calling you the Brett Favre of Guitar Hero.  Oh, no. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, that's not even...  I lost...  Look, I'm getting old.  In my gaming career.  Might be time to go into the Hall of Fame, my friend.  Yeah, maybe.  Tal Stingley would probably be more accurate.  All right.  I, uh...  Is that game set?  Almost.  Almost?  You ready, champ?  Yeah.  He's no good with headphones, but he's going to be trying to go.  What happened to Tank Hanger?  Where's Tank Hanger is?  He's nowhere to be seen now that his man has lost.  Where is he?  Oh, here's Tank.  Tank.  You weren't here to help your man. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, why should I talk to you?  Give Danny a pep talk.  He'd love to hear from you.  You know, first he was going to win when the generator went out.  Now he was going to win when the power cable went out.  I'm still pulling for Danny.  I'm heartbroken here.  Sounds to me like Tank had a little E-Rock anger in there.  Wait a minute, but the competition's over.  So how are you still pulling for him?  Yeah.  I think they need to do one more song.  Why?  Why?  Why do you think that T to the H?  I don't know.  I just think Danny can mop the floor. 
[03:17:30]  Is that what happens in, like, the World Series?  They go, ah, you know, they won.  But let's play out the seven games.  No, that's like when Frasier went down.  Ah, what the hell.  Let's do one more round.  One more round.  And if they did one more song, it would still be two to one.  Yeah.  Why don't they do one more song?  Best out of five.  Wow.  What?  Tank.  Tank, you stink.  Tank.  Sam is like the guy when it comes to hyping. 
[03:18:00]  Hyping.  Yeah, even hyping, you know, people that don't deserve it, but.  Well, he deserves it.  He's a champion.  You know, we will have a rematch, though.  I like that idea.  Yeah.  What day?  You want to put it on the, on the, on the.  Tomorrow.  No, let's have some sleep and maybe a couple weeks of practice.  I will figure it out.  Let's say hi to Steve in Texas.  Steve.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to ask Jimmy how many days in a row he's going to make a Daryl Stingley reference  that nobody noticed.  Dude, I fucking, I will say, before I said it, I realized not only did I do it yesterday, 
[03:18:30]  but it got a zero.  I think it's three days in a row.  No, it's two.  Yesterday was really funny, Jimmy.  I thought you deserved something yesterday.  Today was a little iffy.  Okay.  You know what?  Today didn't go the way I'd planned.  Actually, it went the way I knew it would go, which was nowhere.  It was like just, I just rolled an egg on the floor.  I didn't even bomb.  I just rolled a.  What's that?  Jimmy, this is Steve in Texas.  I sent you the email a couple weeks ago with the, with the tranny video in it. 
[03:19:00]  You replied to me.  What was the tranny video?  Oh, I was just trying to get you to yell at me so I could do a frunkus.  I didn't really send you an email.  How would that get me to yell at you?  I wanted your address so I could go to my old mail and make sure I didn't delete it.  All right, guys, I guess I'm, I'm flaming.  I gotta, I gotta.  Yeah, you better go.  Yeah, right.  Take care of Dow, Stingley.  We got Justin from Eversoft on the line.  This is the, this is the game creator himself, right, Justin?  I'm one of the game creators. 
[03:19:30]  I have a copy of Guitar Hero for Evan, which is going to be signed by the entire company.  Oh, that is, whoa, my computer programmers, they're going to sign it?  They made the game, man.  Fuck me, man.  God damn it.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  That green-eyed monster.  Shit.  I really wanted the guys, man, I really wanted the guys who, who developed Tony Hawk's Pro  Skater to fucking, I really wanted all their autographs.  Hey, you're insulting the creators of the game.  Hey, what's wrong?  Yeah, come on. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, so wait.  This guy is giving a lot of people a lot of fun.  So you guys have, Evan's going to get a signed copy of the game?  Yeah.  So wait, Justin, you do the mo-cap and stuff?  Yeah.  So you just basically tape golf balls to people.  That's a pretty sweet gig.  I actually met Ozzy Osbourne.  It was pretty cool.  Doing what?  He actually came in and did the mo-cap.  He got in the suit and we hooked them all up and he took a piece of tape at me.  It was crazy.  Yeah, Danny, what celebrities have you ever met?  He's got me there.  So basically, all right, Evan's going to get like a signed free copy of the game. 
[03:20:30]  And a little glory.  All right.  Evan, as a programmer, I said this yesterday, this seems like a very easy game to program.  But then I found out that actually it's not.  Yeah.  No, it's not.  I was going to call you out on that.  But a lot of people say it's just like it's a complicated version of Simon Says.  No, well, you got to take, there's different difficulties.  So they got to like, you know, you got to kind of work at it until it works.  Justin, can I ask you a question? 
[03:21:00]  It's a video game.  If it's so difficult to program, and I'm not just busting your balls to bust them,  but if it's so difficult to program, how do you, I mean, there's ways to make your own  Guitar Hero note tracks, like your note chords.  I was just going to say, I've made custom songs.  Well, there's a lot of hackers out there that hack it, and they're pretty smart guys who do it.  But we do have like a creator, I guess, in the game now, so you can kind of create your own.  Yeah.  So it's so difficult, even you can do it now.  Cool.  Thanks.  Danny's mad at Guitar Hero.  It's a ridiculous thing to say. 
[03:21:30]  That's all.  You're mad at one of the creators now, because you lost it.  Exactly.  He's a creator.  He does mocap.  How deep does this go with you?  He puts a fucking wetsuit on celebrities.  That sounds like a cool job.  All right, Justin.  Yeah, it's not too bad.  It's pretty fun.  Look, we can't do much time on you, you know, it's kind of, it's geek talk.  You can only do a little bit of that.  All right.  Here goes Justin from Eversoft.  All right.  You want to start Through the Fire and the Flames?  That's what it's called, right? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  Give me the spotlight.  This is known as one of the hardest songs you can do on Guitar Hero.  Is it?  Yeah.  Not for the fireman.  Okay, enough.  I'm rooting for him to crack 85%.  He's going to start, then we're going to go to break, and we'll see how he does.  Exactly.  Is that it?  What are you doing?  Where's Tank?  I got nothing.  Tank.  Fucking Tank is on you.  Well, you ought to do it again. 
[03:22:30]  You know what he is?  E-Rock is talking mashed potatoes.  He's also eating them.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Why is this so hard?  It's a lot of notes.  Yeah, you try to hit those notes.  Because if you're not, if you're not, if you're actually not hammer tapping and pulling off,  then you're not really doing it.  It's like they set this one up.  Kind of like a, like how you'd actually kind of have to play it. 
[03:23:00]  That's very fast guitar playing.  Jesus Christ.  Look at his face.  Yeah.  He's the best.  He missed one.  He sucks.  What sucks is, this goes on forever.  That's good guitaring, though.  I'll say that.  Jesus.  Come on. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, they're all the same side.  Who couldn't do this?  That's crazy.  Strum, strum, strum, strum, strum.  Strum, strum, strum, strum.  Is he doing well, Danny?  Yeah, he's doing all right.  All right, this goes on forever.  So why don't we take a break and we'll, uh, we'll see where Evan's at with this song.  Yeah, I'm going to go take a piss.  Rock and roll.  Evan's doing really, really well with, uh, Through the Fire and Plains.  This song's still going. 
[03:24:00]  This song is ridiculous.  Where did Guitar Zero go?  He left.  Danny did say, like, that, uh, Evan's doing a better job than he probably would have done.  This song is ridiculous.  When you see these notes flying by like this, turn him down a little bit.  Speaking of video games, Anthony, did you read today what the...  Whoa, whoa, exactly.  What happened?  He couldn't finish the song.  What?  What?  You just got booed? 
[03:24:30]  Wait, what happened?  The song failed.  91%.  91%.  Yeah, but it didn't finish.  Did you finish?  You finished?  Did you finish again?  I failed the song.  Why?  You failed.  Because I got a certain amount of bad notes.  Too close together.  Yeah, he failed.  But you were at 91% before you failed, right?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Good booing.  All right.  Listen to that crowd.  Yeah, they're hostile.  They're pissed.  Boy, they sure are. 
[03:25:00]  The fake people on the video game.  Don't fuck with me, folks.  Sounds like...  All right.  It sounds like any O&A appearance at the Hard Rock without the racist comments.  Danny, be honest now.  You just saw, you looked at his stats.  He found the song officially, but...  No, he did 91% on Expert Fire and Flams.  I would have never come close to that.  But he didn't finish the song.  You left the room.  What?  He didn't finish.  Yeah, he failed.  He failed.  Yeah, he was up to...  He was doing 91%.  I know. 
[03:25:30]  Then he had a bunch of bad notes in a row.  Oh, completed 91% on Expert Fire and Flams.  Yeah, the song failed.  Oh, he says completed.  I didn't see that.  I thought he actually got the 91%.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Completed 91%.  No, he completed 91% of the song.  But then failed.  But then, you know, the epic fail.  I was about to say, because 91% is...  I mean, if he got through 91% of that, I was like, holy shit.  Yeah, that guy's definitely better than me.  But he's...  I think that is what that means.  No, it isn't.  I think that means that.  I think that is what that means.  It doesn't, Primetime.  No.  I think so.  Wrapping up our video game segment here. 
[03:26:00]  Wii Sports is best-selling game ever.  Yeah, I read that yesterday.  Beating out, what, Super Mario Brothers.  Wow.  Oh, that's one of Jimmy's favorites.  The original I like, but there's no one with it.  It's fucking horrendous.  You don't like driving around in the mid-air?  On Mario karts?  Oh, it fucking sucks, dude.  It fucking sucks.  What does it sound like?  It fucking sucks.  Bling-ding.  Bling-ding.  Oh, look, I'm going to drive into the square, floating.  You fucking asshole. 
[03:26:30]  Drive out of the LA like fucking Harry Chapin.  You get so angry, though.  Because it's enraging that they could do better and they don't.  It's fun.  It would be fun if they looked like real people.  How'd they go with the cartoon angle?  Bling-ding.  Bling-ding.  Bling-ding.  Bling-ding.  Bling-ding.  Bling-ding.  Bling-ding.  Because you're a stats guy.  Why has Wii Sports beat out Super Mario Brothers?  I would say because more people own the console and are playing more games.  Video games are hotter than ever.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's packaged with the console. 
[03:27:00]  Right, it's packaged with it.  You can't fucking not have it.  Good point.  So they're not actually searching it out on their own.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you can play with the whole family, too.  I like that.  That's the best part.  Which is really nice.  Yeah, while you're fucking your daughter, you can play and...  Is Tank Hankerson...  She was just staring at me.  No, because I was trying to think of a Susan Smith joke.  That was what I was...  I thought of it, but it was like two seconds too late earlier when we were talking about  let the horse...  Pew. 
[03:27:30]  Let the horse out of the barn.  The wee float.  Oh, God, that really stinks.  That smells like very bad breath.  Get Tank Hankerson here.  Coincidence?  It's got that moth-ball-y kind of...  Yeah.  Wow, that's really bad.  What is that about?  You suck so bad today, you gotta do this for the show.  What is this?  I want to spray it right under your nose.  Keep it away from me.  You know I go crazy with stuff like this.  Can I spray it on your face?  No.  No, why are you dead for him? 
[03:28:00]  No, not that.  On your cock.  I won't spray it on your face, though.  Spray it on your ass?  How about a shirt?  No, that'd be cool.  All right.  What is it?  I'm not saying yet.  I want E-Rock to be the first one.  Breath spray?  Where you want it?  It is, yes, but it's just right on it.  All right, wait.  It's on his hand?  On the shirt, too. 
[03:28:30]  Does it spray?  No.  I think it hurts.  Oh, okay.  I think it hurts.  I gotta go...  Where you gotta go?  Oh, my God!  Get away, get away, get away.  I'll not smell you.  I'll fucking shoot you.  What are you, crazy?  Wow.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit, that's really bad.  Oh, my God.  Dude!  Dude, that's fucking...  Don't let it on the chair, you fucking maniac!  I don't sit here.  It's all right. 
[03:29:00]  You know, you're just making the whole place stink even more.  You could have walked out and washed your hands.  Yeah, Rock, I can't believe you would do that.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God damn it.  I can't believe you would do that.  Wow, that's fair.  Yeah, yeah, I do, actually.  All right, Danny, you smell it.  Holy shit.  Oh, no, you're not doing it right.  You're not doing it right.  Yeah, yeah.  Believe me, I got right in there.  Trust me.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit, you know.  I don't even know how to describe that.  Yeah, I do.  Wait, it smells exactly like shit. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, I'm hungry.  That is smelly ass.  That's cracky ass.  You got a mic?  Oh, God, it's shit.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's exactly shit.  Hold on, where are you going?  Don't let the audience smell it.  No, no, wait.  They're actually able to put shit in a bottle.  Yeah, here.  Dude, that smells like shit.  Wait, get the mic out among the audience.  Oh, it's shit.  It really smells like shit. 
[03:30:00]  Look, we can't fuck with you guys.  Who wants to smell this stuff?  Raise your hand.  All right.  Would you take it on your hand?  All right.  Who, who, who?  All right, come here.  Oh, dude.  It smells like diarrhea, not even shit.  It's the worst smell ever.  This is Rachel.  Hi, Rachel.  You want to put your hand up?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  Put your hand up.  Ready?  All right. 
[03:30:30]  Let it sink in for a second.  Yeah.  It smells like swamp airs.  Oh, it smells...  It does really smell.  It gets worse, though.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Hey, Earl.  Earl, come here.  Earl, come here.  We got a new sponsor that we want you to check.  What?  Come here, come here.  Earl, come here.  Earl, come here.  Earl.  Earl, come on.  Earl, come on.  Try it.  Earl, come in here. 
[03:31:00]  Just smell it.  All right.  Oh, God.  This is so bad.  Dude, it's so fucking bad.  Earl, what's it smell like?  What's it smell like, Earl?  It smells like your ass.  It really is shit.  I didn't even spray it any on me, and it's on me.  Dude, it's fucking just permeating this room.  Who else wants to smell this?  I don't know.  This is shit.  Hey, Butcher, you want to smell this?  It's shit.  E-Rock had an ounce of balls.  Oh, my God.  He just sprayed his face.  Oh, my God. 
[03:31:30]  What did he do?  He sprayed it all over Butcher.  And Butcher's running to the sink.  He sprayed it on Butcher's face.  All over his clothes and his face.  Talk to the audience.  Who else wants to let this?  Who else wants this?  Do this whole studio.  Anybody else want to try this?  This studio fucking stinks so bad.  You'd think we just did our regular show.  We're going to have to go for it.  Who else?  Hey, Evan, you want to try this?  Yeah.  I thought it was just our nose picking. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  Just smell it.  Yeah.  Just smell it.  Yeah.  Just smell it.  Just smell it.  Just smell it.  Just smell it.  Just smell it.  Just smell it.  Just smell it.  Just smell it.  Just smell it.  Just smell it.  It's authentic.  Butcher's puking?  He's a puking.  He's puking.  He's puking.  Dude, it smells so fucking bad.  Well, it's a new sponsor.  What is it?  They didn't spend enough money to get this type of advertising there, Will.  This is a freebie.  All right.  Who else wants a taste?  Danny hit it right on the head, though.  I couldn't even describe it. 
[03:32:30]  He goes, no, it smells like shit.  And then you go, oh, my God.  It is shit.  It smells like fucking shit.  It's diarrhea shit.  Oh, God.  It's like shit in a cadaver.  Yeah.  Oh, this is horrible.  Is it on your shirt there, E-Roc?  It's so bad.  Oh, yeah.  It's still on his shirt.  Bro, it is so fucking bad.  Did the studio fucking re-  Butch is naked in the fucking production studio.  He had to take his clothes off. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, they got eye drops, too.  Oh, do they?  Great.  God, if I knew this was safe, I would give a lot of money for someone to take it in their eyes.  Never.  I don't know if it's safe, though.  Not for the eyes.  That's just to drop it somewhere, like, behind a couch.  Yeah.  I know.  We wouldn't do that, would we?  Oh, no.  You know, it's going to fucking stay forever.  What do you think has to be here tomorrow morning?  I know.  Come on.  Oh, God.  It fucking is bad.  Really bad. 
[03:33:30]  It's amazing.  This is really, really bad.  We can't do, well.  We can't stay in the studio any longer.  How about we say this?

Did anyone figure it out?  Well, I see.  You just drip it on something.  Eye drops?  It's not eye drops.  Are you insane?  You know what I mean?  Like the fucking...  You just drop it like on the carpet behind a couch.  Will, what is this stuff?  You want to tell the people?  It's called liquid ass.  Is it actually called liquid ass? 
[03:34:30]  It's called liquid ass.  Liquid ass dot com.  Liquid ass dot com.  Right.  Somebody's a...  Boy, are they going to be freaked out by all the hits they get today.  And they better fucking spend a little more money, motherfuckers.  See, Will, I'm...  Way to welcome them aboard, O.  Yeah, go fuck you and fuck your product.  Oh, no.  Pay us.  Liquid ass.  Ah!  God damn it.  It doesn't...  You're fucking...  Your nose doesn't even get used to it.  Tippy Tom has been in this fucking studio, and eventually... 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  You're like...  Your nose gets used to the smell.  Yeah.  Your receptors kind of give up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The battle.  This won't go away.  All right.  I think we've done enough damage for one way.  I don't have any on me.  It sounds like somebody opened an iPhone.  Fuck you.  It smells like the Verizon store.  It certainly does.  Bunch of fucks.  I can't even fucking deal with this studio anymore.  Goodbye, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Oh, no.  Don't kill... 
[03:35:30]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I'm not saying anything, but Jesus.  Yeah, we...  This is just horrendous.  Oh, good.  I smell it.  Get within two feet of this.  Dude, I smell it, though.  Put your nose on it.  Oh, dude.  It's too bad.  Oh, dude.  The more you spray, the worse it gets.  Dude, it's so...  The more you spray, the worse it gets.  It's like burying your face in an infant's ass crack. 
[03:36:00]  It's fucking terrible.  Does it...  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Does it have anything on it that says how to remove it?  It's almost like if it was...  They somehow perfected...  Like, you know how if you smell your own shit, it's almost not so bad?  They perfected smelling someone else's shit.  Like, it's definitely...  Like, you smell it, and it's like, that's not mine.  And that's part of why it smells so bad.  Get Eastside Dave or Black Girl.  This is called the little...  What do they used to call it in the business?  It's the crossover. 
[03:36:30]  Where's Black Girl?  Oh, my God.  I can't.  Get Black Girl.  I can't fucking smell this anymore.  It's unbelievable how bad it is.  And the more you spray, the worse it gets.  It's getting worse.  Earl.  Yeah.  Did you smell this stuff yet?  Yes, I do.  Can you smell it as you come into the studio?  Yeah.  How bad is it?  Pretty bad.  What does it smell like?  Give me a mic.  What, you just start broadcasting from the mic?  It smells like the worst kind of ass you could pick up. 
[03:37:00]  It's like a horse's ass.  It's gorgeous.  It gets worse.  It gets worse.  I can't take this.  Danny, does it smell really bad when you walk right in?  No.  All right, tell me when it starts smelling.  I smell it now.  Okay, keep coming this way.  It's definitely really bad right here.  Get over here, you're not even going to believe it.  It smells so bad.  It smells worse the longer you stay in here.  What does you get here?  This is the fucking, this is ground zero over here. 
[03:37:30]  And it goes there for what time?  No, I can smell it.  I'm right there.  No, you really don't.  You really don't know.  You have no idea.  You don't know.  You come over here.  You think it's been over here?  I'm already there.  Just get, just get like right over here.  Don't fuck with me.  We will fucking know.  No.  Oh, shit.  This is so bad and not right.  It's horrible. 
[03:38:00]  That is fucking horrible.  I don't know why you would want to sell something that smells like ass, but you've done it.  Well, it's called liquid ass.  And they better spend more money on our show.  It smells like a sublux.  Or we'll start scraping E-Rock's tongue and make our own product.  Wow.  It gets worse the way to spray it.  I got to get out of here.  Where's Eastside Dave?  Is he allowed on our show yet? 
[03:38:30]  I don't think so.  He's still not allowed on our show?  I don't think so.  Really?  I'm not sure.  Oh my god, it's on my clothes now.  Oh god.  It smells really bad.  who's choking us  dude  why did you
