<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with an extensive and profanity-laced discussion about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.  The hosts speculated wildly on possible foul play, including hijacking, the use of a nuclear device or nerve gas, and the incompetence of Malaysian authorities. They debated theories ranging from terrorist involvement to the plane landing on a remote island, a theory briefly investigated by calling someone in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands who reported no such event.  Concerns were raised about the lack of air patrols and the difficulty of tracking a plane with its transponder off. A caller predicted action from the perpetrators within 48 hours. The segment included a comedic bit about a fictional mafia hitman.  Patton Oswalt and Maria Menounos were mentioned as upcoming guests.

The show then transitioned to a conversation about the Vietnam War, triggered by a caller discussing someone who avoided the draft.  The conversation shifted to the caller's father, a Vietnam War F4 Phantom pilot, who was shot in the leg during his service. The caller detailed his father's reaction to *Platoon*, his disdain for the "Chair Force," and shared anecdotes about his father's prized possessions and physique, even showing a picture via Twitter that elicited strong reactions from listeners.

This segued into Jim Norton's experience filming *Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee* with Jerry Seinfeld, focusing on a DeLorean breakdown and their contrasting comedic styles. The discussion broadened to encompass the evolution of comedy, comparing the Johnny Carson era *Tonight Show* to the modern podcast and streaming landscape.  The conversation then turned to gentrification in Brooklyn and downtown LA, the displacement of communities, and crime concentrations, specifically focusing on the Tenderloin district in San Francisco.  Norton shared personal anecdotes and descriptions of the area's unique characters and establishments, including a high-quality Vietnamese restaurant.  He also recounted a disappointing experience at a San Francisco massage parlor, leading to a discussion of a possible food review show concept.  Further discussion covered Yafet Kotto's role in *Alien*, speculation about his religious beliefs, and an appreciation of Charles Grodin's acting career, particularly in *Midnight Run* and *Clifford*.

The show moved on to a discussion of child star Mason Reese and the discovery of a disturbing pilot episode from his past containing inappropriate humor. The hosts reacted to this, contrasting past and present sensibilities regarding child molestation jokes. This led to a discussion of *Chasing Maria Menounos*, its honest portrayal of Menounos's life, family, and relationship challenges, along with the broader implications of reality TV production and editing choices.  Dr. Steve (Weird Medicine) and Jim Brewer (bedtime stories) made brief appearances.  Patton Oswalt and Maria Menounos were confirmed to be in studio.

A significant portion focused on the hosts' reality show, "Chasing Maria Menounos," airing on Oxygen. They discussed challenges with producers and the authenticity of their friendships portrayed, particularly that of Joe Geer.  They contrasted their approach to shows like "The Kardashians" and "90 Day Fiancé," criticizing the underwhelming wedding of a couple featured on the latter.  Maria Menounos and Kevin Dillon were in studio, discussing their relationship, wedding plans (with differing opinions on scale), and careers, with Dillon detailing his online broadcasting network, AfterBuzz TV.

The conversation returned to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, with Menounos mentioning checking if high-ranking officials had cancelled events, suggesting a potential cover-up.  Further speculation ensued, with Patton Oswalt's father, a former Marine pilot and accident investigator, calling in to offer his expert perspective, dismissing many theories and emphasizing factual investigation.  Discussions involved hijacking possibilities, fuel consumption for a 777, and comparisons to other plane disappearances. The segment concluded with further discussion of "Chasing Maria Menounos" and a listener call about the Space Shuttle Endeavour.  A humorous aside involved a TSA agent with a creepy laugh and a lengthy anecdote containing a potentially offensive reference to a child actor’s old TV pilot.


A later segment featured a conversation with Patton Oswalt. It started with a morbid fascination with aesthetically pleasing footage of death and destruction.  Oswalt discussed his relationship with his father, their apathy towards social concerns, and contrasting reactions to perceived "dangerous and cool" acts. He connected this to his stand-up career, emphasizing facts over emotional appeals. The conversation touched on internet personalities like Alex Jones, Jesse Ventura (mocked via impersonation), various Twitter accounts, and Oswalt's brother Matt's YouTube series, "Puddin'," with a comedic comparison by Judd Apatow.  They discussed the overuse of "Thank you for your service," absurd Twitter personalities, past guests like Tim Conway and Jake LaMotta (including a possibly apocryphal story about Conway, Korman, and a drunken tourist), the hosts' past radio work (including their invented word "cunk"), the "Ban Bossy" campaign, the offensiveness of "moist," and Al Sharpton's on-air demeanor. Oswalt discussed upcoming shows, his appearance on *The Tonight Show*, and humorous anecdotes about The Roots.  The discussion concluded with an analysis of *Grease*, Oswalt's cat Beavis, and a final childhood anecdote.

[00:00:00]  Yeah, check, yeah, yeah, check it  I'm up early in the morning, yawning  With Opie Anthony, yeah, Jimmy Tranny, pointing  Opie like brother man, ain't wants to join the clan  Jimmy on the other hand, he working the other hand  Turn my headphones up  There are horrible people, saying this old  Objectible human beings, and I want you to know  Unacceptable to my scene, and I'll give it a go  50 Cent Larry King, Opie and Anthony Show 
[00:00:30]  Go, go, I know you're feeling the flow  But Opie's motherfucking things, trying to get blown  And we come to play around, and we're still in the show  I know you never heard nothing like this before  How important is your board?  Board you'll never be, and don't worry about getting shot  When you're with Anthony, oh yeah, on the edge of your  Yeah, cause you really wanna hear  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy  Just keep it right here  This is Opie and Anthony Show  Yeah, Opie and Anthony Show  Yeah, check it out, it's the Opie and Anthony Show  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony Show 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, yeah, 50, yeah  Now I might type it up in this pit  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  Booga, booga, booga, booga, booga  Enough of this plava  Let's get this show on the road  Ah, Friday  Good morning, everyone  TGIF, everybody  Yeah  TGIF  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Whang  Where's the plane?  Oh my god 
[00:01:30]  This now  Me and Anthony were having a little discussion before the show  I'm on high alert  You're creeping me out  I'm on high alert  I honestly think we are looking at a horrible delivery system for a weapon  I really think this plane is in some bad people's hands right now  And is going to be used for something terrible  Like a nuke or something  A dirty bomb  Imagine a 777 loaded with nerve gas 
[00:02:00]  Old surplus bombs  It could do more damage than 9-11  That's for sure  And of course we would be the number one target  Could you imagine the Freedom Tower being taken out  It's like, look, you're not safe  You can't ever be safe  It's  The problem is  The way this thing went off course  And the transponders  And there was a couple of them on board 
[00:02:30]  Right  And I read they were shut down sequentially  Fourteen minutes apart  Fourteen minutes apart  What is the transponders?  What do they do, first of all?  It lets everybody that's tracking aircraft in the world  Know what plane it is  What type of plane it is  What company owns it  So there should be a rule that  You're not allowed to turn those off ever  Well, I think you're not supposed to turn them off  But they were turned off  Fourteen minutes apart  Two of them  Turned off  No wreckage has washed up 
[00:03:00]  Now, after a week  Something  A life jacket  A panel  A foam rubber  Anything  Has always washed up on shore somewhere  When there's been a crash at sea  There's always been something  Hold on  What if the crash is in the middle of the Indian Ocean, though?  Wouldn't that take a little more time?  It might  It might  But, again, why would you fly to the middle of the Indian Ocean before ditching the plane?  Well, if everyone was, you know  If we had a Payne Stewart situation 
[00:03:30]  It's not looking like that  Or if we had a, you know, a pilot that didn't feel like living anymore  It was too calculated  Yeah  From the time that they lost track of it  Till  The potential of how far it could have gone  There's too much  That could have gone on  That was going on  The shutdown of the transponders  It, uh  I don't know  Could you imagine a terrorist organization getting a hold of a fucking airliner?  Here's my thing, too 
[00:04:00]  How far away is  By, like, Indonesia  Yeah  So it's really  Well, they already said  Far from here  They already said they could make it to Pakistan with the fuel they had  Yeah  Yep  And there's plenty of other islands  Other remote places  That if you're a terrorist organization  Al-Qaeda  Whatever  That hasn't done anything major  Since 9-11  But you know they're planning  You know they plan things  I honestly think  Like, the United States ought to start 
[00:04:30]  Doing some 24-7 patrols  Of the east and west coast  With the air defenses  Well, the thing that caught us off guard on 9-11  Was there were planes that left Newark  You're right  Airport  And Boston  Yeah  So there's no time to react  It's kind of hard to fly a plane from here  From Pakistan  It's not  Without the military picking it up  Without it?  No  I was telling Opie the same thing  During 9-11  We all had this sense that 
[00:05:00]  You can't just fly a plane into a building  Or, oh my god  The Pentagon  There's got to be anti-aircraft weapons  We all thought there was something in place  To stop that  Unless the transponder  Unless the transponder on a plane is on  You can't identify it as even a plane  With just radar  And if it's flying low  It's even harder  It could turn up as a flock of birds  Or a small plane  Or nothing at all  Without that transponder 
[00:05:30]  That's  The rules of the air  Are  You have your transponder on  That identifies your plane  As to what it is  How big it is  What type of plane  The company that is flying  The flight number  All that shit  Is told to the people  Through the transponders  You shut those off  You can't track everything  That's in the air  Just on radar  So, is it possible  To intercept it  And shoot it down?  Of course it is  But is it a definite? 
[00:06:00]  No  Abso-fucking-lutely not  Although, would it be shot down?  Now, if there's  Let's just say  Okay, to go with Anthony's theory  Let's say that you're right  And let's say that those people  Are still alive  And they're told  They don't know  The whole world's looking for them  Because they have no communication  Oh boy  Maybe they say  We are negotiating for your release  And then one day  They say  We've negotiated your release  Get on the plane  Yeah  And they don't know  That the entire fucking bottom of it  Has been loaded  Oh my god  Now that plane can't be shot down 
[00:06:30]  Because the whole world knows  There's 200 people on it  You'd have to shoot down  200 people  Yeah  Imagine that call  Imagine making that call  Hey  We gotta fucking  Just incinerate you guys  Because  And think about it  With nuclear material  Not an atomic bomb  But nuclear material  Crashing in  All that dust we saw  On 9-11  Could you imagine that  Being irradiated  And blowing over  A city like New York  It's horrifying to think 
[00:07:00]  That this is now  Not something that  Is just to be laughed at  Is it definite again  No  But it's not just  Something now  To be go  Oh you crazy conspiracy guy  This should be  Like one of the  Number one things  That crosses the president's desk  In the morning  Because it's a  It's a viable  Threat  To this country  You're creeping everyone out  I know  But it  It should be looked at  We should do patrols  Like we used to  With the Soviet Union 
[00:07:30]  The old eagle and the bear patrols  24-7  Up and down the east and west coast  How about the plane  Is just in the  It's at the bottom of the ocean  Could be  But again  What about the black box  Wreckage always shows up  There's been no pinging  Off a black box  Could that mean that  It's at the bottom of the ocean  It  It could  But again  No wreckage  No savages  On some fucking little island  Saying I saw smoke  One day  We heard a bang  That no sign of a crash 
[00:08:00]  Has turned up  And every single crash  That there's ever been  In modern aviation history  Something turns up  A fucking piece of foam rubber  A panel off of the galley  Something  I believe though  We're constantly looking  You know  On 9-11  We were caught  With our pants down  As they say  But now I think  We're much more aware  Of delivery systems  And other things  That could be done  Have you heard anyone  From any administration  Saying hey  Not to panic anyone 
[00:08:30]  But we are  Keeping tabs  I'm sure they're doing  Some stuff  They don't want to tell anybody  You would assume that right  You would assume  And it doesn't help  That Malaysia is a  Third world country  Third world fucking country  And they don't have  Their shit together  That plane's painted all nice  Don't let it fucking  Trick you  Oh the paint job  Is beautiful  Exactly  Don't let it trick you  That this country knows  What the fuck they're doing  Or isn't corrupt enough  And poor enough  To want to take  Maybe some  Some of that  Huge  Muslim Arab money 
[00:09:00]  So you mean  Maybe some of the  One of the pilots  Even if he wasn't  Radicalized  In on it  Right  Oh we were discussing that  How easy would it be  To just show up  At one of these  Pilots residencies  And just have a talk  With them  Say hey  Hey man  How about we behead  Your whole fucking family  Or  Or you could join  Our side  Or you let the guy  In first class  Fucking come up front  During the flight  Right  Or you just take it here  Or yeah  Or yeah  You take it here  They would probably  You know  I would assume  That would be a possibility 
[00:09:30]  There's so many  Possibilities  We could talk maybe  One pilot in the world  To  Yeah  It's horrifying  But it's the whole fucking  Maybe the plane  If the phones are taking off  Everybody on the plane  Right  And they tell them  Look you're being taken hostage  We're not gonna crash the planes  This is not 9-11  We're taking your phone  And they land  You're at 35,000 feet  You're not getting a signal  First of all  Right  That's a great time  To fucking collect up  Everybody's communication devices  And  Now you're a hostage 
[00:10:00]  With no recourse  It's a horrifying prospect  That I think  Really ought to be  Starting to be looked into  Very good question  Why is the pilot able  To turn off the transponder  If it's that important  Yeah exactly  Why would there ever be  A reason to turn that thing off  There's always been  This trust  Of the pilots  That they're not  Doing anything  Bad  They're  You know  They're to be trusted  And  You know  Obviously  There's also  Other things 
[00:10:30]  On there  Like a breaker  Everything has a breaker on it  That if  Let's say  There was a problem  With the transponder  That  All of a sudden  A warning light  Comes on  That says  There's a short  And it's  It's a  There's a potential hazard  The pilot needs  That ability  To shut that system down  Right  You know  It's  14 minutes apart  Is a little freaky  It is freaky  That's  That means  That somebody  Changed that course  Of that plane  And  It wasn't  One of those situations 
[00:11:00]  Of  Decompression  Or  Everybody being  Knocked out  Or did they turn off  On their own  Because of  Right  Something going on  In that plane  A major failure  Yeah a major  Failure  I mean a lot  Of aviation experts  And pilots  Themselves  Are saying  This looks like  A deliberate  Act  Oh my god  Of shutting  These systems down  Then why  14 minutes apart  Sorry  Why 14 minutes apart  Why do you tip your hand  Like that  Instead of just  Doing them together  I don't know  Or maybe the pilot  Wanted to commit suicide  But again 
[00:11:30]  And he just didn't want  You know  People to know  Where that plane was  Again wreckage  And what he was up to  Wreckage wreckage  But in the middle  Of the Indian ocean  I'm thinking  Like I said  But it  It always turns  I'm holding out  A little hope  A week later  Well that  Something washes  That part of it  Is crazy  You would assume  Somebody would have  Saw something  A bloated body  Somewhere  On some beach  Somewhere  A fucking piece  Anything  That  Something that  Would have  There's a lot of  Shit that floats  On a plane  Not if it's  2,000 miles out  If it did have 
[00:12:00]  A mechanical flare  And if they dig  One in the middle  Of the Indian ocean  Or wherever it was  If it's  1,800 miles  90 miles  Yeah but 1,800 miles  Something might not  Necessarily have washed up  Yeah message in a bottle  Sometimes those take  You know  Yeah  20, 30 years  Yeah  That's true  But a little bottle  Is a little smaller  Than a fucking plane  It's scary  It's a scary prospect  That I just think  People ought to be  Directing a little  More attention  To at this point  Because it's  A dangerous situation  A fucking 
[00:12:30]  Imagine a terrorist  Organization  Having a delivery  System  That could reach  This country  At will  It's  It's scary  Yeah  That's a missile  It's like hey  You have a guided  Fucking missile now  Right  Now you just gotta  Load it up  With something dangerous  And fly it into  The fucking  Freedom Tower  Manhattan  I think you should  Have left your paranoia  At home  You're freaking  Everyone out  I know  Brian in Charlotte  What's up Brian  Hey let me tell you 
[00:13:00]  If Tony's wrong  On this one  We're gonna see  This fucking plot  At the Oscar  Next year  Because that's  Unbelievably  Amazing  Crazy  If it's true  Holy shit  It's  It's crazy scary  How far of a flight  Is say Pakistan though  Meaning maybe the US  Is not the target with it  It might not be  Of course  Because it was so  Maybe the Soviet Union  Is  Because  It's something closer  Yeah yeah  Moscow  Something like that  You're right  That's a far  That's a long way  To bring a fully loaded  777 without detection 
[00:13:30]  Yeah  Because there's always  Something that can  There's  You know  From Boston  And we almost had  The military planes here  On time  Maybe London  You know  There's plenty of  Other western  Type  Nations  That would be  Great targets  Obviously  We're the big prize  But  That's a long flight  It is a long flight  But it's doable  Which is very  Fucking scary  But to take that chance  To go through all this  And then go that far  Hoping to be undetected  Doesn't seem 
[00:14:00]  Feasible  That's a long way  To go without being detected  And again  On 9-11  No one knew  It was happening  It was a complete  Fucking surprise  The Jets almost  Got here on time  From these  Like they missed it  By a few minutes  Getting here on time  But they also  Had transponders  They  And  Enough so  They were  And they were on  Long enough  Where they knew  At that point  They had them on radar  And could track them  With the transponders  Off  They knew it was coming  And then after knowing 
[00:14:30]  That planes were hijacked  They were able to  Track them  We got one thing  Going for us though  Yeah  Liam Neeson  Well that's true  We do have Liam  Liam Neeson  And knows how to deal  With these situations  Yes he does  And I'm assuming  He's on that plane  So  He's taking care  Of business right now  The plane has been  Taken  Taken  Did he say that?  Yes  He's like  You're about to be  Taken  He did say that  In that movie?  In Taken  And then in Taken 2  He goes  Me and your mother  Are going to be  Taken 
[00:15:00]  They probably make him say  He's probably  Can I just say it another way  They're like  No no  Can I say we're going to  You know  Kidnapped or something  No it's got to be Taken  We're about to be  Soy sauce head  Yes  We're about to have  California rolls  Rubbed on our scalp  And eaten  We're about to  Have delicious sushi treats  Dipped into our scalp  Yeah  Oh boy  Just find the plane please  Anything would  Would help  Like fucking  Just one  A panel 
[00:15:30]  Of cargo door  A piece of the tail  Passport  Right  Anything  A passport  You're right  All that luggage  All those things  That something  A ship  Might find  A bump into  A fucking  It would have washed up  On a beach  Something  Nothing being found  In this day and age  Is insane  Well the Indian Ocean  What does that lead to?  Like yeah yeah yeah  India  India  India  Just close to Pakistan  Yeah 
[00:16:00]  And then what else  Like how long of a flight  Is that?  Does anybody know  Like a rough idea?  It would have been  To see the Andaman Islands  They're thinking  I mean  It's on the  The course  That the plane  Deviated to  Well they're saying  It flew toward that island  On purpose  Toward the island  Yeah  Now they're saying  On purpose  Let's see what this guy's saying  Airplane may have been  Flying toward  Your home  And that  There is a possibility  It could have landed there  We know that there's  An Indian naval base  We know that they have 
[00:16:30]  An airstrip  We know there are  Other airstrips  On the island  Do you know anything  About the possibility  That a big plane  We would have known by now  Landed  Anywhere near where you live  Do you think they're not trading  Satellites on that  Fucking island?  There is  No chance  No such chance  That any aircraft  Of this size  Can come towards  Andaman and  Mikubar Islands  And land  In any island  As of now  Very hard to hide  A fucking  777  From radar  I mean from a  Satellite 
[00:17:00]  That was where it went  Wow  They're sure it went  In that direction  Right?  At this point  They're sure  It turned in that direction  Whether it turned again  After they shut everything off  They're not sure  The chances are  Apart from  These four airstrips  It cannot land  In any other island  And it  And the kind of  Surveillance  Regular  24 hours  Of women  Stunned by the  Andaman and  Nikubar  For a month  There are no chances 
[00:17:30]  That such a  Big aircraft  Coming towards  Andaman  Can be missed  Okay so Mr. Giles  Let me repeat  What you're saying  Just so we're clear  You're saying  You've heard nothing  About this  And you would know  Because there are  Only a few airstrips  They are under  Mostly Indian  Naval command  So it would be  Immediately discovered  If a plane of this size  Were to land there  You've heard  Nothing like that  Alright so  If an airstrip  Was carved out  Of the jungle  Somewhere  I mean if you're 
[00:18:00]  A terrorist organization  That's going to  This extent  You did some  Pre-planning  Like 9-11  Obviously  Years in advance  They were planning  Things  Well this holds  In your plot  According to Tom  Tom in Jersey  Go ahead  Hi sweetie  I mostly agree  With Anthony here  But you've got to  Think  And as wonderful  As the government  Is  That they have to  Be watching  The major terrorist  Organization  To see if  Something like this  Happens  You'd think  What they're doing  To see  And I mean 
[00:18:30]  Not to  Look  Not to just use this  As an excuse  To bash the Obama  Administration  But we all know  That the  Focus  On Muslim  Terrorist groups  Has  Really been  Under Obama  They're not  Fucking paying  Attention as much  As they should be  For the love of god  I don't know  Obama's been  Sending some  Predator drones  I kind of  Like the fact  That he's  Disappointing 
[00:19:00]  Every liberal  The usual suspects  Though I mean  This  Well you've got to  Think that  As high profile  As this story is  And potential  Like you said  The potential  For a terrorist  Organization  They can't be  Not watching  They may not  Tell us until  It's over  But they have  To be watching  Well  Yeah that's  That's true  I mean  I'd like to  Believe that  But again  I mean  Before 9-11  We were all  Under the impression  That this was  Impossible  Could never happen  Remember you thought 
[00:19:30]  There were guys  With fucking  Missile launchers  On the roof  Of the pentagon  And the white house  And you know  Oh they can't  Possibly  Get a plane there  It would be shot down  And then boom  Boom boom  Nothing  Well I'm sure  We've put things  In place since 9-11  Though thank god  Could be  You would assume  Right  You'd assume  Thank you Tom  Alright  Punch it up  Alright but they're saying  There's no chance  That plane is on that island  No chance  What is it  The Andaman  Yeah  The Andaman island  Or islands  Yeah  Well they may have  Turned it  Like you said  If they turned it off  And went one way  Maybe 15 minutes later 
[00:20:00]  They'd come right back  Around the other  Right  If it was not deliberate  But how do they know  15 minutes apart  I guess they can  They have so much shit  That is transmitted  From these planes  But they're also saying  That the pilot  Could have  Saw that there was  A major problem  With the aircraft  And was trying to  Turn it all the way  Around and go back  To where it came from  And didn't make  The whole  Turn for whatever reason  Why shut the  Transponders off  Then  Is it possible  One was turned off  And one malfunctioned  Like maybe you said  One was a major problem 
[00:20:30]  Turned it off  And then yellow  And malfunctioned  Possible  Well whatever the problem  Was on the plane  Caused the transponders  But why didn't he get  Maybe it was a fire  Maybe it was  I don't know  Again wreckage  Some kind of  No distress signal  Wreckage wreckage wreckage  No  No distress signal  Of incest  Yeah nothing  I mean  They didn't get any  Any  The pilot  Didn't get on the horn  And start saying  Hey we have an  Emergency up here  We have a fire  We've had rapid  Decompression  We had like nothing 
[00:21:00]  It just  This plane was taken  It's really  What  I honestly think  This plane was fucking  Whether it's still  In one piece  Whether it was  Drilled into  I don't know  But I  Absolutely  Based on what I've heard  And you know  Everyone's speculating  But those small pieces  Of information  That these pilots  And other aviation experts  And the guy that was  In charge of the  Flight 800 investigation  And stuff  I mean all these people  Are saying  This looks like 
[00:21:30]  A deliberate  A deliberate  Takeover  In the cockpit  Whether it was  The flight crew  Whether it was  An intruder  Into the cockpit  They don't know  But  It's not looking like  Something happened  Up there  As far as  An accident goes  Wow  Frightening  Frightening  You have to think  The pilot would be on it  Someone has a missile  Someone has a fucking missile  How do we have fun now  I don't know  I don't know  I love looking at a big map 
[00:22:00]  That the US is not on  Which means we're nowhere near  Right now  Yeah  They're not sneaking  A 777  Across the ocean  No  Yeah but if they hit like  Israel or somewhere else  That could cause some  They could do that  Some major problems  In this world  Or I mean  If you're flying  Major fucking problems  If you're flying  You know  A few hundred feet  Above the ocean  You're not gonna be  Fucking seen  It does not  Unless it's a chance  Siding by another plane  Or a chance  Siding by a ship  Or something  Yeah but  If you're not 
[00:22:30]  If you're at night  You know  There are actual  Fucking lanes  That the planes use  You can just fly  That fuck  It's doable  Is what it is  And that's the scary part  It's not an impossibility  Did you get all this  From your boys at Fox  Or  Fox News  My friend  No  I was reading  The Wall Street Journal  Articles  A lot of legitimate  News outlets  And some experts  Yeah this isn't  Just conspiracy sites  No  This has hit  Some of the other places 
[00:23:00]  False flag operation  Hmm  How far is it from Israel?  That's a good question  How far is it?  They could plow  Right into Israel  And jet fuel  Isn't hard to come by  It's you know  It's fucking kerosene  It's easy to fucking  Fuel up a god damn jet  So if it's somewhere close  It could just be  A full plane load  Of fuel  Into something  Yeah you could do that  And if it's  Far  It could be loaded  With weapons  With yeah  There's plenty of fucking  Weapons laying around 
[00:23:30]  Over there  In that area  Of the world  Fucking  All those  Imagine nerve gas  Or  It's gonna be terrible  Panic everyone  Panic  Jesus  Panic  Yeah what could be  The target over there  If it's that far  Just find wreckage  Today police  I know right  Little bit of wreckage  And everyone would just go  Alright  It fucking crashed  You see the seriousness  Of this when you watch  The news channels  They're all like  Where the hell  Is this plane 
[00:24:00]  Where is it  But there isn't  Enough information  To totally run with it  And go  Hey there's danger  So they're like  Well it could be  But I mean  This is going on  A long time  To not see  Any piece  Of this fucking plane  In an area  Where there are  A lot of islands  A lot of  You know  Real estate  Knew there was  A major problem  And thought  His best shot  Was getting to that  Andaman islands  And shutting off  The transponders  Well the major problem 
[00:24:30]  Caused that  That's the big thing  Major problem caused that  Oh yeah  Yeah  I don't know  And that's my shot  To you know  Not one fucking  Getting on the radio  And saying  We're gonna try  For this island  Because we have a problem  Maybe all that was  Turned off  Yeah  By the problem  On the plane  And the engines  That they're saying  That signal  That is sent  From the engines  It's four hours  Of flying  The thing did fly  For four hours  Are you sure  Because it's still  Conflicting that 
[00:25:00]  Malaysia's saying no  But it works like  OnStar  The signal  Comes from  The engine  Regardless if  They pay for the  Service or not  You have to  If you're American Airlines  You say  Alright I'm gonna pay  Rolls Royce  For this service  I wanna know  How long these engines  Are running  Whatever  Right  And then you pay  Like OnStar  Malaysia  Being a third world country  They're not paying  For the service  But that doesn't mean  The signal isn't  Still going out 
[00:25:30]  And can be  Looked at  So Malaysia's saying  We don't have any  Fucking signal  From the engines  But meanwhile  Boeing and Rolls Royce  Are going  Yeah  It flew for  Four fucking more hours  So this is something  That the pilots  Can't turn off  Is this signal  No  They can't turn that off  Do you think  The Malaysian government  Or somebody in there  Is behind it  I mean is it possible  I just think  They're  Not competent enough  They're not wealthy enough  To have the resources  To check this out  Yeah maybe they're giving  30 or 40 million 
[00:26:00]  For a plane  Or whatever it is  Yeah that's a lot of money  For a fucking  Just for the plane alone  They're not subscribing  To the old  How long of the  Engine's running  Thing  Do you think  They kill the pictures  The people  Or no  Again that  The hostages  Are very valuable  That scenario  Of having hostages  On the plane  As it's flying  As kind of a  Hey you want to  Shoot this down  You're still going to  Kill this many people  The whole world sees it  If you're willing  To take the plane  You're getting rid  Of the people  Immediately  Or you hold them  As hostages for bait  Hostages right 
[00:26:30]  Yeah they're valuable  We would have  Heard something by now  If it was a hostage situation  Not if they're going  To use it for  Something you know  Load up the cargo  I don't think  It's a hostage situation  They might  Maybe go with your theory  They just wanted the plane  And that was good enough  That makes sense though  If that's why  A terrorist organization  Wouldn't have taken credit  If that was what it was  That's the only answer  To why they don't take credit  Because they still  Want to do something with it  Yeah  But to  Hijacked and landed  Hold on Fox  Question mark 
[00:27:00]  You burn the fuel down  It's light  You can land on  A very short runway  The braking development  Straight ahead  Boy  Why would you say  Straight ahead  Another developing story  Involving a plane  Right here at home  Terror on the tarmac  We are evacuating the plane  Oh my gosh  Nothing  Good find  The plane is on fire  It wasn't on fire  The nose wheel collapsed  It was trying to take off  When the wheel  Right  The wheel collapsed  On the nose  Oh was it 
[00:27:30]  I heard it was a flat  Or whatever  No the whole  Like the whole gear  Oh really  Yeah  I heard it first  It was a blowout  By the way  You know that  That story of hijacked  As it was trying to take off  Is bullshit  Because it's not  The lead story  You don't tease  Hijacked and landed  Right  The missing plane  We'll let you know  Right  Yeah  Coming up at 11  We'll get back to you  With this  A USS kid is heading  To the Indian Ocean  Yeah  Some kid is going to  Figure this out  Just some kid  It's the headline 
[00:28:00]  I was seeing that  That's some kid  Oh you got some smart kids  Out there  I'm a million dollars Richard  Oh wow  That's where Brian is this morning  He's off trying to play the lottery  Hey I'm Clayton  In for Brian this morning  Hope you're doing well  We begin with a Fox News alert  This hour  Because moments ago  We learned investigators  In India  Began looking on land now  To find that missing airplane  Searching hundreds of  Uninhabited islands  Oh boy  This is new satellite reports  Prove the plane  May have flown  An additional five hours  After it disappeared 
[00:28:30]  From radar  So here on the map  This was the last point  At which we had contact  Then it turned possibly  And went in that direction  Brand new clues also suggest  The flight was in fact sabotaged  And according to U.S. officials  Someone intentionally shut down  Two separate communication systems  That data reporting system  At 1.07 a.m.  And then another one  The transponder  Just a few minutes later  At 1.21 a.m.  Just before that jet turned  Douglas Ader is live in Washington  With more of these latest developments  Which changed by the minute  Doug  Can you tell us at this hour 
[00:29:00]  And Clayton good morning  We have a lot of new evidence  And a lot of old evidence  Panic  And you combine it all  And it seems to point to something  Deliberate here  Let's start with what's new  And it has to do with that engine data  That was continually pinged  During this flight  And the interesting thing about this  Is that that data continued to flow  For maybe five hours  After this aircraft  Otherwise  Seemed to disappear  Now this tells us that the plane  Kept flying  It doesn't tell us  Where it was flying  For that we turn to an old bit of evidence 
[00:29:30]  That Malaysian radar contact  Remember Malaysian officials said  That shortly after this plane took off  And the communication equipment  Was shut down  The plane appeared  Or something appeared  To make a sharp turn  To the left  And then it headed west  All of this indicating  That perhaps  This was something deliberate  There has to be human involvement here  First of all  Even with the transponder  Even if there was an electrical failure  There are battery backups  For that kind of thing  Second of all  If the plane was in distress  It would have had  There are multiple systems 
[00:30:00]  For  You could radio for help  You could electronically signal for help  So now there is a renewed focus  On a number of different aspects  Of this flight  Including for instance  The flight crew  What were they doing  In the days  Leading up to the flight  Oh boy  This also has a big impact  Oh that's not good  On the search area  And we were talking about  A relatively limited search area  That initially included  The waters in and around Malaysia  But the fact that this thing  May have been flying  For another four or five hours  Wides that out significantly 
[00:30:30]  And all of a sudden  You're talking about  A pretty good portion  Of the globe here  Maybe as far southeast as Australia  As far to the northwest as India  We know now  That the search is really  Beginning to focus  On the Indian Ocean  The U.S. is assisting  In that effort  But it's not really clear  Who is ultimately in charge  Because the wreckage  Hasn't been found  There's been no country  That's responsible  And has the authority  To conduct a formal  Aviation crash investigation  So it's really quite a problem  Because in fact 
[00:31:00]  As the former chairman  Of the NTSB  Jim Hall  Likes to tell people  You need somebody in charge  And literally  At this point  Nobody is in charge  Because there's no country  That's not coming up  The investigations  That's fucked too  You mentioned the fact  The United States  Is helping out  One of the things  The Navy has done  Is they have dispatched  The destroyer  The USS Kidd  To the Indian Ocean  To help in this effort  But this is going to be  A massive undertaking  Steve Clayton  And Elizabeth  Microscopes on it 
[00:31:30]  And things of that nature  I'm going to say a lot  For us this morning  With the latest  And breaking details  Thanks Doug  You know just the fact  That there are  He's not going to add anything  That's legitimately a concern  There's no one in charge  That's a big thing too  Like you need somebody  To take the lead  On these investigations  And just the fact  That it's so up in the air  And there's so many  Countries involved  But nobody really  Taking the lead  That's  That is detrimental  To the investigation  This is just a bad situation man 
[00:32:00]  This is not a good thing  I hope you're wrong  I do too  I mean  Believe me  And as of yesterday  I would have said  You're out of your fucking mind  I know  But that 14 minutes apart thing  Every day that they  Find other shit  It just  When I see it  We will not give up  Still after six days  No sign of flight 370  There  One thing that will come out  If a bus came offline  If something happened  To turn the transponders off  Then later other things  Were turned off  14 minutes later 
[00:32:30]  That would tell me  That there was some kind  Of control  Some kind of failure  That had to be reacted to  14 minutes would give you  Time to transfer the bus power  To deploy the emergency  Ram generator  To radio  Those kinds of things  Take a little time  How would you then explain  During past wars  And all that sort of thing  Oh he's a former pilot  I used to fly  A flight and struck  Out of a little tiny airport  In Gainesville, Florida  Called Williston  And it was 7500 feet  Of concrete  And it was 100 
[00:33:00]  I think it was 100 feet  Either 75 or 100 feet wide  You could land a 777  Right there  You can land a 777  A lot of places  That you can't take off  Because you burn  The fuel down  It's light  You can land  On a very short runway  Where are they looking  At this hour  Because this is  The fascinating thing  Is you look at  That flight path  They're scouring  Those flight paths  Which by the way  According to the  Wall Street Journal  Flight paths look like  They could head  Towards the Middle East  So right now  They're looking at  These Anaman Islands  And the Nicobar Islands  Which have 572 islands 
[00:33:30]  There that they have  To scour  But only 37 of them  Are habitable  So they're having  To look there  The question though  Is why would you  Want a plane like this  What would you do  With it once you  Had we had  Lieutenant General  Tom McInerney  On the show  A little earlier  This morning  Start up your own  Airlines  Right  You could do that  Just get your  Can of spray paint  Spray paint over it  Why would you want one  Maybe Ted is  Starting an airline  I have one plane  Seven dollars 
[00:34:00]  First bidder  Seven dollars  It's just looking  Very  I bet we'll have  Some significant  Info over the weekend  I hope so  It would be nice  Significant  Very hard to hide  A plane  From the air  From satellites  From spy planes  You know  If you are  That worried about this  As a country  You would think  You would fly around  And see  I'm sure they are  You know  I'm sure they're doing 
[00:34:30]  A lot of that stuff  But then you have to  Think about  Another country's  Airspace  You can't just  Fly planes  Over other countries  Airspace  With  You know  Hey we're going to  Fucking turn our  Spy equipment on  Over your country  We do  Fuck yourself  With the Predator  Well  We do  But  It's kind of  A sneaky thing  You can't get caught  Yeah  But wait a minute  Now those pings  In that Rolls Royce engine  Yeah  Can they be taken out  Meaning 
[00:35:00]  Now that everybody  Knows that they're there  I never knew  They were there  And you have to  Assume people know  Yeah  Can  Rolls Royce  I guess  Can't track them  Exactly to where they are  They can just know  That they were running  But can  Will it pick up a ping  Once those engines start again  Once they turn on again  And is there a way to disable that  Who knows  There might be no way to disable that  Right  But if there is  That's a problem  Maybe just crack the fucking antennas off  Who knows  It's got to be something that transmits  So  It's just  If 
[00:35:30]  And again  If they went to this extent  And planned  This  This I mean  Would be an  Insane plan  To pull off  It would have to be  Very far in advance  And  And you would have to have  Other  Contingencies  Like  Like an airstrip somewhere  A place to  To hold  Two  Two hundred plus people  A nice hotel  What do you do  Yeah  You gotta feed them  And  And  Keep them in one place  Have 
[00:36:00]  Have  Facilities  For that many people  Unless you just fucking  Shot them  Right off the bat  No way  It's  No way you shoot them  You know  You can't  It's like  To have that many hostages  If things go wrong  Is too valuable  You don't give up  Fucking  Two hundred and something  Hostages  Maybe you shoot  Fucking  You know  Ninety percent of them  You shoot the hostage  Shoot the hostage  It's  Obviously  A lot of  Speculation here  But  This is something 
[00:36:30]  Again  Like Jimmy said  Yesterday  You're crazy  Talking like this  Today  It's like  Eh  It's at least  Something to  Seriously  Consider  Eh  Well thanks for that  Ant  That's great  Hey no problem  Wonderful  Yeah  Have a good day  Everyone  Have a nice day  That was pretty convincing  That 14 minutes  Look to the sky  Is a big thing  Yeah  China wants more info  I'm sure they do  There's a rogue plane  Out there  A rogue plane 
[00:37:00]  Yes  That's what the general  Will say in the trailer  There's a rogue plane  Out there gentlemen  And my job  Is to find it  Set up a perimeter  I want a hard target search  It'd be  Yeah  Fuck  Well what else  Is going on  Well  March Madness  Patton Oswalt's coming in  For the whole show  He should be here soon  Oh that's true  Yeah  Oh is he here for the whole show  Good  I believe so  Good  Yeah  Big chunk of it  Didn't he do the tonight show  The other night  I saw his twitter 
[00:37:30]  I didn't see the show  I would assume yes  Yeah he did it last night  Oh he did  Okay  And Maria Menounos  Is coming in  Supposedly she's like  A fan of the show  With her husband  Or something  Oh yeah  I think she's got a reality show  Or something  Oh yeah  I didn't watch it though  I didn't watch it either  I meant to  But I didn't  She's going to just come in  And say hi  Oh  Yeah  I've been busy  Just taking like  Little funny pictures  Of myself  Trying to set the  Modeling portfolio  It's my new dream  Oh my god  To be a model  Yes I want to be a model  Nice  Very good  Aren't you too old for that 
[00:38:00]  No  Never too old  They told me  Okay  Alright  I heard that message  Were these pictures  On your twitter  No just on my home computer  Just me smiling  Making wry faces  When are we going to get to see them  Koi  Once my entire portfolio  Oh I see  Okay  Do you do any cheeky shots  Sure I do  How about koi  Mid laugh  Yeah  Like I'll make myself laugh  About something  Yeah  Like I'll just think of  One of the clever things  I've said  And then in my  In my mid natural laugh  I'll hit the camera button  And let that magic  For my new modeling portfolio  Very good 
[00:38:30]  We got a guy that wants to  Join your panic party  Alright  Let's say hi to Steve  In Indianapolis  Steve  Hey boys  Hello  In this little panic party  So here's the take  These guys have been  Planning this out for years  They have to  Anticipated that everybody  Be looking for them  Short order  Looking for the damages  Are looking for the aircraft  Or whatever  So they probably  Are going to  Carry this out  The final act  Whatever they're going to do  With the plane  Within the next 24 to 48 hours  Oh look at this guy  Wait why sir  Doomsday preppers 
[00:39:00]  Buddies  Yeah so the deal is  Is that  They're going to  They're going to  Take this plane  Whatever  Wherever they have it now  And do something with it  In short order  They're not going to  Sit on it  Because they realize  That everybody  They probably didn't  Anticipate this  OnStar accessory  That they have  On the engines  So they realize  That they've got to  Do something really fast  Run it into  Another airport  Or you know  A building  Or something like that  I say this  I don't believe  That they didn't know 
[00:39:30]  About the OnStar thing  Because if you  If you can make  A 777  Disappear  With the technology  We have now  Amazing  You're probably aware  That the OnStar thing  Was there  And maybe they knew  It couldn't be  Traced  Yeah  And it doesn't track  You can't track  The plane with it  So it's kind of  Inconsequential  Is there no way  To track that though  How can you not  Have any way  To track that  It's fucked up  Without that transponder  It's just another  Thing in the air 
[00:40:00]  That you know  You see this  Those computer  When you punch up  How many planes  Are in the air  At any given moment  And it's just  Fucking thousands  It could be anything  A flock of birds  You know  Radar picks up  All kinds of shit  It could be anything  I was reading about  That Boeing plane  That was stolen  In 2003  That they never found  Wow really  Yeah  It was taken  Taken  It was taken 
[00:40:30]  From an airport  In Angola  And they never found it  Wow  Never  And that's  Building up a fleet  But nothing ever  Happened to the plane  And they  Maybe that was  Just a dry run though  They dismissed terrorism  Like five years later  Because nothing ever happened  And they never found it  They never found it  But that wasn't  A plane full of people either  No  And it was taken  From the ground  It was two people  That just took the plane  Turned the transponder off  And just  Flew without  John Travolta did it  Yeah  It was one of those  But the FBI  And the CIA  They got involved  In everything  And nobody ever found 
[00:41:00]  Anything  You know what  Maybe that's  Something they want to do  They got two planes  Although you don't  Intentionally take one  And hold it for  You don't hold a plane  For 11 years  11 years  Hope nobody finds it  Alright here's the plan  Yeah  And you gotta fly  Those planes around  They need  Constant maintenance  And can't just  Leave a plane sitting  Maybe they take off  Once in a while  And zip it around  The island  Zip it around  Right back down  Be fun  We have nine minutes  Of fuel gentlemen  Just taking it 
[00:41:30]  For joy rides  Yeah  Because they can  Alright we got food  And we got Patton Oswald  Is here  So why don't we  Take a break here  And Patton's gonna  Join the show next  Stay  The date is  October 11th  1983  It's 7.18pm  Detective Club Soda  With self-professed  Organized crime soldier  Lyle Chipperson  Okay Lyle  You're requesting  Placement in  Witness Protection  What kind of  Information do you  Have for us  Yo I'm in the mafia 
[00:42:00]  Don't even fuck around  With me  Don't get defensive  Just explain your  Business here  I was in the mafia  For years  My mob name  Was Lil Chippy D  Okay Lyle  You have no record  You've been seen  With none of our  Organized crime contacts  What was your role  The hitman  A hitman  Mafia hitman  Right  The mafia  Well who do you  Work most closely with  I ain't no rat  Then I don't know  Why you're here  Are you afraid  Of repercussions  Yeah good luck  Killing me 
[00:42:30]  I carry like  Fucking bazookas  Lyle  There's no way  You could have  Carried around  A weapon like that  If you're just here  To waste my time  I suggest you leave  Fuck you  Cocksucker  I'd shoot and kill  Everybody  Bury in a hole  Or something  Then we'll see  Mr. Chipperson  Why are you here  Fucking stupid  Cocksucker  Start listening  You fucking piece of shit  I can't believe  You wasted our fucking  Time with this bullshit  Do you know  This is a crime  Make him an offer  That no one refuses  Why don't you  Do yourself a favor 
[00:43:00]  Lyle  Walk out the door  Now  Fuck you  You're a funny guy  Laugh at this  You like that  How does this feel  Fuck this  This is Richard Gervais  Hi this is Richard Gervais  Welcome back to the  opening Anthony show  With Jim Norton of course  Love Jim Norton  Love his little strange  Face  And head  And brain  Got Patton Oswalt 
[00:43:30]  Outside the studio  Making his way in  Yeah  We love Patton  There he is  Welcome back  Patton  Yay  Although Anthony  Just creeped everyone out  So  I did creep everyone out  With the fucking missing airplane  His dating stories  Creeped everyone out  With my  He thinks the plane 
[00:44:00]  Was stolen basically  I definitely think  This fucking thing  Was taken by somebody  Now what the intent is  Is completely speculative  But it really looks like  There was a  A concerted effort  To make this plane invisible  And then fly it  Somewhere  For something  But my only question is  If you now have  A 7-7  Let's say  That was funny  So we have now  Stolen a 7-7-7  Yeah  You've got to refuel it  Right  You've got like  Where do you get the money  And supplies to do that 
[00:44:30]  Or do they have that  Already set aside waiting  Right  I would think  If you're going to go  To this extent  To steal a plane  You know  You do have to do  A little  Prep work  Yeah  Prep on that  And aviation fuel  Is just kerosene  Really  So  I mean  Those things fly on anything  I don't know about how  I'm assuming  It's really expensive  Just because the 7-7-7  Is so gigantic  It's just  Yeah  But again  It's just  It's kerosene  I mean  You get a fucking  A few barrels of kerosene  You top it off  And you're  You're back in the air 
[00:45:00]  I got  I'm going to talk  To my dad  I was telling  Jim out in the hall  That my dad  Used to investigate  Plane crashes  And he  So I usually  When something crazy  Like this happens  I wait a few days  And go  Okay what is  I wait for all the craziness  To die down  Right  And all the nutty theories  Right  Albert Brooks retweeted  Someone's tumbler  That had a pretty  Interesting theory  That fit all  Again  But you can make anything  Fit the facts  You can  But she really  Made it fit the facts  Of that  A takeover 
[00:45:30]  Was happening  And the pilot  Realized  What was going on  And  Deliberately  Turfed the plane out  Yeah  To  To save  You know  Tens of thousands  Of people on the ground  Right  But why do they  Turn the things  Off 14 minutes apart  Though  Again  The transponders  And that  Isn't that new  Information  Yeah  I don't know  And again  That's  That's very eerie  And what the fuck  And anything  As far as  Wreckage goes  Anything  A lot of crap 
[00:46:00]  Floats on these planes  Nothing  Has turned up  And washed up  On a beach  A week later  Yeah  And the fact  That they keep  Changing the search  Yeah  Is really  Weird  Yeah  We're expanding  It again  Somewhere between  The north and south  Poles  Oh okay  It's pretty much  The whole world  We're looking  Inside of a boat  In a Boston backyard  Right now  We're just  Every possibility  We're gonna do  Yeah  It's that  It is getting  That creepy  So  It's 
[00:46:30]  Jimmy said earlier  It's like  Yesterday  Or a couple  Of days ago  Any theory  Of this plane  Being taken  Was looked at  Like you were  Kind of crazy  And a conspiracy  Alex Jones  You know  It's a false flag  Operation  Let's get him  On the phone  Let's do this  But now  It's  You know  Could you call  Alex Jones  I'm serious  It's not that  Crazy to think  That  They're obviously  Constantly planning  Shit  You know  They want to  Do something  Bad again  Well yeah  It does feel like  I mean like  The  Unless I'm mistaken 
[00:47:00]  The attack on the  World Trade Center  In 1993  Was a dry run  Right  For what went down  In 2001  And  And these guys  Have  They don't think  In terms of  A couple of months  They have  10 20 year plans  Yep  So we could  We could be seeing  The clumsy beginning  Of something  That's gonna  Right  Come back  In 10 or 20 years  They're very  Yeah  They're very dedicated  To their cause  Patient  Very patient  Indeed  See I'm an optimist  Though  See my thing  Is the plane  Was taken  But it's because  They're starting up  A charitable organization 
[00:47:30]  And they want to  Help people  So they're loading it  With fun things  Like balloons  And what not  To have the big lunch  Jump off on people  That want kittens  And balloons  Helpful things  So these guys  Have definitely  Taken the  Axl Rose  Chinese democracy  Model  For a  Really  Let's work on this  Right  Really get to  Bring in bucket head  You know  They keep bringing in  Different guys  Keep firing them  I fired all these  Bum guys  They're not good  They're bringing  A whole new crew  They're terrible  It's a little creepy 
[00:48:00]  Let's call Patton's father  Yeah I mean  He lives in Virginia  I bet he's awake  I would love to  Get him on  Do you mind  Because I kind of  Mind  I think this would be great  Let's surprise my dad  An investigator  And yeah  And I will  He should be up by now  No  Yeah I know  He's an ex-marine  He's up  This is late for him  For God's sake  Yeah it's pretty cool  What's the number  Just say it  And if he investigated  If he investigated  Plane crashes  This could be good  Well he was the one  That talked me down  When I was getting  A little freaked out 
[00:48:30]  About 9-11  When he just said  Look  Velocity  Fuel  And steel  Together  Create weird stuff  Weird things happen  In every single  Plane crash  So to sit there  And go  Yeah but  In this plane crash  It doesn't matter  Each one is its own  Sealed thing  And you have to  Just start from scratch  And you can't  So that  That made me go  Oh okay  Yeah you can't  Just take a past  Plane crash  And go  Apply everything  To another one  Hey let  If you get him 
[00:49:00]  On the phone  Have me talk  To him first  Because if he's like  This is a radio show  He might hang up  Or something  He's like  Yeah  Are we calling him now  Or  Yeah they're trying  Alright  You can put him through  Poor guy  Maybe you should have  Called first  And said  Oh shoot  A little preamble  Hold on Sal  You don't call yet Sal  Yeah Sal  Hang on  Yeah  You got him  Let me  Stupid Sal  No stupid me  No  So you call him first  And then we'll  Get him on the air  Hey we're gonna call  Yeah

[00:50:00]  The other day  With Obama  Which is one of the  Funniest things  And you still could not  Get over your hatred  No he actually did  I said I thought it was funny  And I think  If you just get  The guys like on Fox News  Bashing him  Just for that  Right  It shows that like  Alright you just  Don't like anything he does  No I found that very funny  Yeah no it was  It was in  I thought  Yeah yeah  And he beat up Fox  For having to  You know hate on it  Yeah it's  You know  That was ridiculous  How they had to hate  On that  It's kind of useless  Well you pointed out 
[00:50:30]  If Bush  Well he's just letting  His hair down  Everyone calm down  Everyone's having fun  Come on  Zach had balls though  Man cause that's  Even if both of them  Know it's a set up  And it's fun  Yeah  It's still ballsy  To say to the  Fucking sitting US president  What is it like  To be the last black president  That's a fucking ballsy joke  To pull off  Pre-approved or not  That's a great one  Funny line  Yeah you never know  How that could go  The wrong way  No problem  Went with it  So you know  Gotta give him credit  For going for it  I'm assuming he was  A Zach fan first

[00:52:00]  Really?  I always try to think  Of something to  Come back with  When somebody  Is hating on you  And then you  Hit reply  And realize  You gotta now  Do some editing  And you're 17 characters  Over before you  Even said anything  And then you just go  Ah fuck it  And you give up on it  I give  I don't have enough room here  I don't know how to  Fucking condense  All these words  That's why you find  That profile picture  And you just find  If there's an obvious  Physical flaw 
[00:52:30]  Attack  That is one of the  Greatest things to do  Right to the schoolyard  Nice pig you're married to  Send  That is it  I didn't tell you  To put that  Fucking measure  Profile photo  Before you insult me  It really is  A playground mentality  Wasn't there  There was  A few months ago  There was some dude  Attacked us  You and me  And we were going  Back and forth  And he was something  Like two white guys  Whining about  Something  Oh boy  And then someone  Went it out  You say in your profile 
[00:53:00]  You're a lacrosse fanatic  And you're pointing out  White guys  Yeah yeah  And then that's all  People did to him  And then he was like  Unfollow black  Like he just  Yeah  You just walked right into it  They can't handle it  Yeah people don't realize  Sometimes that  You know  There are a lot of  Followers of Jim Dorton  And Pat Noswell  There are  A lot of times  I won't even have to come in  I just retweet  Whatever they tweeted  And they'll be like  Ah they'll take care of it  Our people  Will take care of this  Because they hate it too 
[00:53:30]  They can see that  Douchiness  They're like  They've had it  They pretty much  Have had it too  I know it's great  Where's Patton's father  Is this going down  I texted him  Yeah  He has not texted back  I could try to call him  When we go to break  He's still in his bunk  Yeah  Wow this is  This is compelling  Magic radio guys  It really is  Waiting for a tweet  For my dad  Waiting for a tweet  I like that  It's going to take some time  It'll build  There's a story now  There's no rush  How was it growing up  With a Marine  As a father  I was actually 
[00:54:00]  Pretty lucky  Because he was  One of those Marines  That he was in Vietnam  For three years  He got shot in the leg  Wow  He saw some really  Horrific shit  And he was one of those guys  That was like  You and your brother  Will never ever join  The army  Wow  I will kill you  Before you join the army  The stuff that I saw  And he also  It was kind of cool  Having him around me  Because he always gave me  A great perspective on  Like I was  I was the classic  Like  These guys are trying  To send us to war 
[00:54:30]  And they're all  Draft dodgers  They're draft dodging  Doesn't that piss you off  Dad  And he's like  Well I'm  I'm pissed that they're  Like someone like Bush  Is sending us to war  But I'm not  The fact that he's  A draft dodger  That's admirable  He found a way  To get his ass  Out of Vietnam  I didn't do that  I fucked up  And went over there  So someone who  Avoided the Vietnam War  That act in itself  Is a pretty  That's a  Point in the pro column  Hey he found a way  To get out of it  That's a pretty smart guy 
[00:55:00]  Now he should have  Also gone  Hey I got out of it  I'm going to make sure  No one else has to go do it  But he goes  Dodging the draft  Is a good thing  That means the guy  Is smart  And thought shit through  Like I did not  What years was he  Over there  78 to 81  Yeah he was  He was touring  With Mr. Mister  And he got  Yeah one of the roadies  Got really mad at him  And shot him in the lake  But still he was like  You will never join the  You know  And when he said  When he said the army  He meant the two 
[00:55:30]  The two boy army  Which was  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  So that he was  I remember that  My dad  The worst time for him  Was when the movie  Platoon came out  Oh  And not because  It brought back  Any memories for him  He was just like  It's a movie  And what happened  Was all my mom's  Friends were suddenly  Larry  I really suddenly  Understand  Oh no  What it was 
[00:56:00]  That you went through  I saw a platoon  And now I  I can really feel  For what you must have  Yeah  Can you  Fucking leave me alone  All of you  We were at a dinner  What people  Some runs over for dinner  And some  Woman just started  In on him  Again  I just saw a platoon  And you just saw  His shoulders  Like god damn it  And you were  A marine pilot  Like so were you  You must  You were dropping  Bombs on people  That you didn't even know  Oh shit  Like that must have been  So did you ever  Have any crisis  Of conscience 
[00:56:30]  Or are you haunted  By it  My dad just goes  We only bombed  Hospitals and schools  And just like  I heard  He was so pissed off  What was he  Do you know  What he flew over there  He flew the F4s  Phantoms  Wow  Yeah which were  They were like  You know the diesel  Yeah  Those were the last  Before everything  Got computerized  Right  The jets  Are like  Those were  Yeah those were jets  Those were  Crazy  Really  You could very easily  Fuck up in your jet  Cause there was 
[00:57:00]  No computer stuff  You had to  Right  Everything  It was  It was the  It's the  It's the  It's the  It's the difference  Between like  Driving a stick shift  And driving an automatic  Yeah yeah  Wow  Those F4s  Yeah it was  Pretty intense  Yeah those are  Synonymous with  Like the Hueys  Synonymous with the  Vietnam War  The phantoms  Are like  You see a phantom  You're like  Yeah that's Vietnam  Yeah  You see a phantom  And you literally  Start hearing  Creedence Clearwater's  Fortunate son  In your head  Like  Exactly  Okay yeah  Vietnam  There we go  Yeah  Wow a phantom pilot

[01:01:00]  Or as my dad  Would call them  The Chair Force  Chair Force  Get it  Yeah  He was so  Oh you get it  They like me old days  That's right  Chair Force  He was Marine  So  Chair Force  Oh they must hate  The Air Force  Is being coddled  When they're treated so well  Each branch  Hates each other  They all are  Yeah  Making fun of each other  And how much  They can't stand it  Like  No those guys  Aren't  We are the only  And the Air Force  I'm sure it feels  The same way 
[01:01:30]  About the Marines  Yeah  The Air Force  Is treated the best  I think though  I think those guys  Get the best food  Because they're like  The pilots  Yeah  Yeah but the Marines  They do  And then the Naval  AVA tour  Yeah  So  And then the Army  Is like the dregs  Oh yeah  Army's always just  Boy do they get shit on  Yeah  They don't even get  Flown over to the war  They have to get  Themselves there  Get a sort of  Kickstarter campaign  Just to get yourself  Over to the battle  I tried out for the  I joined the Navy 
[01:02:00]  But I didn't make it  Because they put me  In this pool  And I went underwater  And I turned upside down  And I couldn't get out  And they yelled at me  DOR'd you?  They certainly did  Really?  My young red hair  Yes we remember  When they say drop on request  They mean their request  Not yours  Yeah we are gonna DOR you  We're DORing it for you  Was that Caruso's first movie  When he's in fucking  It was an early one  Oh shit that's right  He is in there  He's the guy  He turned up  So he just couldn't  Get out of it  He's panicking  He's panicky Pete  You did that thing? 
[01:02:30]  Oh no I'm just kidding  I was just referencing it  Because it was  I could see a young  Jim Norton  In his parachute pants  Exactly having a  Biloxi blues incident  Except it's with  The Christopher Walken character  How was it doing  The Seinfeld show?  I was a big fan  Of that web series  That was so much fun  You know what he did?  And you'll agree with this  He recreated  What comedians do 
[01:03:00]  On the road  To kill the day  Before the show  Which is  Got you a hooker?  Yeah get a hooker  There's their one  Getting a hooker  With Jim Norton  Comedians in cars  Getting hookers  Comedians incarcerated  But it's that  Oh we can turn  Getting coffee  Into a five hour thing  Where we sit  And we bitch  About our careers  And we philosophize  As to what real comedy is  So yeah that is  The life of a comedian  During the day  Is how do I kill  The eight hours  Before the show?  But your car broke down 
[01:03:30]  Well he went  He wanted to get a DeLorean  Yep  So he picks me up  In the DeLorean  And it's on film  It gets to the bottom  Of the hill  That my house is on  And completely  Just died  Breaks down  And it breaks down  Like the way cars  Break down  In bad comedies  Where smoke is coming out  And goo is coming out  Of the back  And just dripping  Like it looked like  It was rigged  Yeah  To do that  And for a second  I thought it was  And then  That's when Jerry went  Do you have like  Ubu or something like that 
[01:04:00]  Or whatever  What's it called?  Uber  Uber  Uber  Uber or something  And I was like  Yeah I have Uber  And I  He goes well maybe  You should get a car  And we'll  Try to find another DeLorean  And they had  Jerry Seinfeld  He had another DeLorean  He found another DeLorean  And that came  And met us downtown  Wow  Yeah  That's power  Yeah  We need a DeLorean  Get me another DeLorean  Yeah no problem  I need a DeLorean  To meet me somewhere  Yeah  I literally can't get  An Uber half the time  I have a fucking app  Get a DeLorean  Meet him  Yeah they see your name  Oh god 
[01:04:30]  I know what he wants me for  Yeah no tip in one star  Of rating  This guy stinks  I like Seinfeld more  After this  Comedians in Cars  Getting Coffee  He's got more of an edge  To him than I think  Most people realize  He does  And there was some stuff  That they cut out  Of our segment  Where we kind of  Got into an argument  Really  It's not a mean one  But a thing about  I was more  He's more about  I like to get a bit  And really refine it  And I just  And I do it  And that's what I like to do  And it's you know  I treat them as songs 
[01:05:00]  I'm like I  Get a bit to where  I think it's perfect  And then it's done  And I want to keep  Generating new stuff  I never want to  Repeat stuff  Once it comes out  On an album  Or a special  It can never be  Set again on stage  Like that's my  And he had a  And he put up  A pretty good argument  I thought for  How his way  Of seeing things  But it was  It really was  Like these kind of  Two generations  Of  Because he did  Come from a time  Not that he's  From the 40s  Or something  But there was  A time where  Because the 
[01:05:30]  Tonight Show  Loomed over  Everything with Carson  It was all about  Honing and getting  It perfect  And I came up  When I was coming up  I saw the  Tonight Show  Go away  So it became  More about  Okay you gotta  Generate new stuff  And you know  Now there's  A lot more  Material  Yeah exactly  Because I do  Way more  Podcasts  And shows  And stuff like that  And I realized  Oh well if  Seinfeld's gonna go  Do comedy  He can just  Go right  To the  Tonight Show  So he's gonna 
[01:06:00]  Have something  That's ready to go  I would have  Just hit your  Argument with  The Seinfeld  Theme on my phone  Oh really  You think that's  The best way  To do it  I think my way  Is good  Hey can you  Rewind this a little  Bit  Here's the scene  From  Comedians  In cars getting  Coffee with the  DeLorean  Crapping out  Wow  Oh it is  Smoking  Do you see  The stance  Of fear  It really looks  Like it just  Came back  From the future  Yeah 
[01:06:30]  I'm not feeling  A bit here  Are you  The only thing  That makes it  Possibly a bit  Is that  It's a DeLorean  And in a weird  Way you and I  Are reliving  Symbolically  The whole rise  And fall  This is literally  This sounds like  A panel story  To me  I didn't know  That we had  Different kind of  Go with that  Panel my friend  Please  Is panel better  Than a bit  Is panel  Oh okay  Bits  Nothing better  Than a bit  A killer bit  A bit  Is a bar  Of gold  A talk show  Panel story  Is something  That's too good 
[01:07:00]  To throw out  But not good  Enough  To use  Like this car  That was  Kind of the  Beginning of our  What did Roger Ebert say  No good movie  Is long enough  And no bad movie  Is short enough  That's a good line  Yeah  Well long and short  Are code words  For good and bad  Exactly  Yeah  There are eight second  Videos that I can't  Watch two seconds  Of  Oh that's funny  No  No never got them  You're like a unicorn  Yeah 
[01:07:30]  I'd be writing on  Sketch shows  And they would  Literally say  The Hitler sketch  Is really funny  Does he have to be  So anti-Semitic  They're trying to  Fix the cause  I actually got that  And then cutting  It was this huge event  It was in Time magazine  And literally six months  Later they're like  Yeah he's alive  Okay now I want to  Ask you  How would you  Have killed Superman  Superman gets his powers  From our yellow sun  But he's here  Every day  Soaking up  They're all curious  Make it a thing  Where it's like 
[01:08:00]  The longer he stays  Here now it's starting  To kill him  And then there's  A massive disaster  Looming  Do I stay  And stop this thing  Happening but then  Die in the process  Or do I leave  And save myself  That's really good  Story of thinking  You just did there  I would like to see  Your screenplays  I'm just joking  I have no interest  I think he's into me  I loved Jerry Seinfeld  After this whole series  It was great  Yeah yeah  What about  What about downtown LA 
[01:08:30]  That whole thing's coming  It's crazy  Because that's what you guys  Why does Jimmy say  I'm laughing  At the fucking  Oh that line  Yeah  That was great  Yeah  But you guys ended up  In downtown LA  Which is  In downtown LA  Which was the  Making a comeback  Well it's not  It's making a comeback  Slash doing what  Brooklyn did  Right  Exact same thing  Which is bring in  The hipster coffee shops  The hipsters  And I say like  If you want to be  A downtown hipster  You got to get  A way too expensive dog 
[01:09:00]  That's going to die  Too early  You got to have  Distressed jeans  That cost more  Than new jeans  And then you got to have  A creative loft space  Right  That you ride  A bicycle around in  But that's all  It is all happening  Downtown LA  Is now  Is Brooklyn basically  Wow  It really is  Except that unlike  Well there's parts  Of this in Brooklyn too  Three blocks  Of gentrified  Gorgeous  Hipsterism  And then  Literally  On the next block 
[01:09:30]  It's immediate death  Right  If you walk in there  You're immediately murdered  And whenever they  Gentrify the neighborhoods  It's like they  Shove all the bad  Neighborhoods  Into one  Tightly packed  Specific neighborhood  Right  That you could literally  You could almost  Execute criminals  We're just going to  Throw you in the  We're going to have you  Walk down to that bodega  And you'll be murdered  Like it's  They did the same thing  In San Francisco  The tenderloin  Keeps shrinking  Because the hipsters  Keep buying it up  So now the tenderloin  Is the most  Concentrated  Three blocks 
[01:10:00]  Of murder  That you've ever seen  It's so horrifying  And the same thing  In Brooklyn  Especially in downtown LA  It's all  Yeah  The same thing  Wow  You go to Brooklyn  And there's some  Neighborhoods  Where you're like  Oh wow  It's a collective  Anarchist bookstore  And a feminist coffee shop  And then you go  To the next block  And it's just  It's like  Puerto Ricans  Literally just like  Yeah you're going to be killed  You really should go back  To your little  Book collective  Because we're  I don't know what the fuck  You're thinking  We gave you that  We let you have that  Dumb lame block 
[01:10:30]  For yourselves  Yeah yeah  Stay out of here  This is yeah  Go the fuck away  I like the tenderloin  In San Francisco a lot  Like I love it  I mean maybe it's  Gotten worse and worse  As time has gone  I haven't been there  Like a year and a half  Two years  But I love staying there man  It's just  There's like a sexual  Dirty vibe to it  Oh really  Yeah that's where  That's where that all happens  Oh Jesus  Yeah all the O'Farrell  Brothers shits down there  All of the  Down there  There are  There are transvestites  That other transvestites  Would run screaming from  In the tenderloin  Like frightening  Amazing  And again  It's all concentrated  It's all 
[01:11:00]  Yeah  Frightening and amazing  That's a great  No but I'm just thinking  Of the image of some  Awful looking transvestites  And I think  I don't disagree  No  I swear to god  I was like  I think one time  I tweeted  I'm like  I either just saw  The world's ugliest  Transvestite  Or  Yafet Kodo  Is doing research  For a movie  Because I was walking  Through the tenderloin  I go down to market  And I walk  Because it's fascinating  There's people playing chess  And there's people  Just selling the most  Random stuff  And it's  It is a dirty  Kind of gorgeousness 
[01:11:30]  Everywhere  Yeah  And I would never  You'd never want us  To fucking  The midnight run  Yafet Kodo  In a blonde wig  Although the across  110th street one  Maybe let him jerk you off  Yeah that's fun  The alien one  Can do whatever he wanted  If you get it  I love that guy  The alien Yafet Kodo  Can do whatever he wants  That guy's gorgeous  Fucking gorgeous  Isn't he  Is he converted  To Judaism  Or was he born Jewish  I think it's a Jewish  Am I crazy to say that  Really  Why do I think  It's a Jewish  Oh I don't know  I don't know  Wow  I had never heard that  I never heard that 
[01:12:00]  He was Jewish at all  I had heard that  But if they don't turn up  In Adam Sandler's  Hanukkah song  I don't know  Until he sings about him  I will not acknowledge it  Who were people surprised  Was Jewish from that song  There were some people  That you're like  Oh I didn't know  Linda Evans  William Shatner  Gerbils  That's still one of my  Favorite lines from  The Simpsons  When they're talking about  When they  When Krusty the Clown  Is Jewish  And Homer's like  A Jewish entertainer 
[01:12:30]  And Lisa's like  There's a lot of Jews  In show business dad  Linda Evans  William Shatner  Mel Brooks  Mel Brooks is Jewish  So yeah  By the way  In the Tenderloin  On 6th Street  This is in San Francisco  There is a Vietnamese  Restaurant called  Toulon  And it is on  The diciest block  Of the Tenderloin  It is  It's like  There's the Tenderloin  And then there's  The asshole

[01:26:00]  Yeah  Why are you  Why are you going to be gone today?  Gone  Yeah  Hey, this is Dr. Steve from Weird Medicine  With another Dr. Steve Medical Minute  Hi, I was just wondering  For the past week or so  I've woken up and went to the bathroom  And my poop is dark green 
[01:26:30]  I was wondering what causes that  The spectrum of colors you can see in your stool  Is broad and varied  The brown color in normal poo  Is caused by the breakdown of iron and bile  That is secreted into the intestinal tract  Here's a trivia answer for you  The brown pigment in feces is called  Stercobalinogen  Toss that one out at your next church potluck  Poo isn't always brown though  Bright red turds are a sign of bleeding  Usually in the lower GI tract 
[01:27:00]  And need to be evaluated by a health care provider  As soon as possible  White or clay colored chodes  Are a sign of obstruction of the biliary tract  Possibly from a stone or even a tumor  Black stools can come from iron  Pepto-bismol  Or bleeding in the stomach  Although green stools can be seen  In people who eat a lot of spinach  The most common cause of green logs  Is blue food coloring  Found in kids cereals and yogurts and stuff  Mix it with yellow bile  This indigestible dye  Makes a lovely emerald green colored stool 
[01:27:30]  Is this bad for you?  I have no idea  Be sure to check out Weird Medicine  Saturdays at 10pm Eastern  Right here on the Opian Anthony Channel  And now another bedtime story  With Jim Brewer  Listen to this one  I went to Iowa  Dubuque, Iowa  We roll up to this gorgeous hotel  Gorgeous hotel  The kid comes up to me 
[01:28:00]  He's got a camera  And he goes  Brewer  Your dad has to go  He has to go now  And I know I've got about  Five seconds to get him out  In the toilet or it's over  So I go there  I open the door  I'm gonna open the door  There's shit on my fingers  So I'm like  What is this?  Look what  So I'm looking at his hands  I can't understand where it came from  It's not on his hands  And it's fresh  And I can't tell where it's coming from  So I pull him up  And as I pull him up  I put him in the wheelchair  And I'm looking  I don't see nothing 
[01:28:30]  So I roll him in  And as I'm checking  I can smell it  So I'm like  Oh man  I see people looking  And I look at him  He's got shorts on  And I don't know how I missed it  There's clumps  Of dung  Just hanging at his shorts  I finally get up the stairs  And I'm showering  But when I went downstairs  Where I took him out of the car  There's a pile  That must have fell out of his shorts  And it's on the sidewalk  It's such a surreal moment in life  To see like where we go in life  There's a billion flies 
[01:29:00]  All over this thing  And people are just staring at me going  I can't believe someone  Let their dog  Just defecate on the sidewalk  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories  With Jim Brewer  The kids are running wild  Because school's out  But cool's in  No reason to get antsy  Yeah, where are you getting them  And you're pouncy  It's Valley Gym  Oh my God  California is trendsetting again

[01:30:30]  Well, how am I supposed to talk  Like with my butt or something  The Opie and Anthony show is back  On Sirius XM  Best news ever  We got Patton Oswald in the studio  Hi  He was telling me during the break  You love the Ron and Fez stuff  We did recently  Oh my God  Proving that you do listen to this show  When you're driving around LA  I was late to a meeting  That kind of crucial meeting  Because I pulled up  And that was still going on  And I wanted to see how it ended  Right  With the match 
[01:31:00]  I sat there  Yeah  The matchbook and all that  The matchbook  It  Oh God  We'll get into that in a few minutes  But we got Maria Menounos in studio  Looking ridiculous  What the hell  Hi guys  Oh I forgot about the laugh  Hi man  I forgot about the laugh  Thank you  I appreciate it  This is like that Galadriel elf woman  And she's just walked into a troll bin  Ah yes  I'm pretty  I'm pretty  I'm pretty  We are despicable  I'm so sorry  I apologize for everything 
[01:31:30]  Hilarious  I'm sorry  I really regret Patton was going to move over  I'm like no you stay in Maria  I'm like how dumb am I  You are a dunce  Why would I say that  What a dunce  I'm a fool  You want to sit next to Maria do you  You smell very good too  Yeah we sit alone in the hallway  Of course she does  I'm in Patton  Oh okay  So you have a show  A reality show  I didn't watch it  I'm so offended  Oh I forgot you listened to the show too  Uh huh 
[01:32:00]  I got lazy yesterday  You're about to be interviewed by Jimmy  And it's like being bothered at a bus stop  By a weird  Hey you have a show  Right  I had every intention of watching  But I don't know  I believe you  You can come to our screening  Monday or Tuesday night  I'm sure you would love to do that  Where are you screening it  We're screening it  Somewhere in NBC  On Monday night  And then Tuesday night  As well  With like friends and family  And stuff like that  Well that's cool  They let you do that  Well I initiated it  And then they were like  Oh this is a cool idea  So they did like one for 
[01:32:30]  You know kind of press  And stuff like that  For Monday night  Wait are we the press  Are we the Monday night  Or the Tuesday  I would have you guys on Tuesday  Whoa  That's me  Family and friends  My opinion  But whatever  You know your schedule  Will work with  Okay  She would have you there Tuesday  But she values her friends  And cares about them  But she would rather us  Take the hint and go Monday  Will you be there both nights  Or only one of those nights  Both nights  Yeah  Cringing and in the fetal position  That wasn't a creepy question  Travis Bickle  Will you be there both nights 
[01:33:00]  Because I will be there both nights  I wanted to make sure  That she wasn't going to set us up  And say yeah  Come family and friends Tuesday  But she's gone  We are so Monday people  I would not dare  We are obviously Monday people  Hilarious  We got the hint  It's okay  We'll try to go Monday  And check this thing out  What is the show about  I'm annoyed I didn't see it  Yeah now I'm mad too  I feel I'm prepared  I know  Well I'll just have to  Play by play  Minute to minute  And then when I come in next time  I will quiz you guys  Yes  Fair enough  On each episode  Basically it's called 
[01:33:30]  Chasing Maria Menounos  And it's a  You know  The Jim Norton story  I was just thinking that  It's a look behind the scenes  In my life  We have some kind of  Interesting dynamics  At play in the house  Because Kevin and I  Have been together  It'll be 16 years  This evening  Wow  Boo  Who's Kevin?  We aren't married  We don't have kids  Nice  We don't know when to do  Either of those things  So it's kind of  One of those  Questions that a lot of  Women are kind of  Dealing with right now  And so 
[01:34:00]  Anna Kornikova  It's in the paper today  Is it really?  I didn't even see that  How they'll never get married  Well there you go  They're at a point like  Why bother at this point?  Yeah  But when you want  The wedding gifts?  No  Oh yeah  You're rich  No  It's not  But it's not about that  You know why?  Because you know  What comes with the gifts?  How come I wasn't seated  At that table  And why wasn't I  In the bridal party  And blah blah blah blah  Everyone makes a wedding  About them  And it's never about the bride  I don't need a headache  I got enough headaches  It's true  This is Kevin though  I don't know about this Kevin 
[01:34:30]  I'm not marrying you yet  I mean  That could happen today  If you wanted to  I swear to God  This is Travis Bickle  From Ice  I don't know about this Kevin  He's weird  He stands in a hall  Why do you want to be  With this guy?  Want to go to the movies?  Well when we wanted to  When we wanted to  There were some family issues  That get explored in the show  That kind of prevented us  From doing it  His family or your family?  You'll see  Oh boy  Yeah  And you got that stuff on camera  They were okay with that 
[01:35:00]  Stuff being filmed  And that's going to be out there?  Yeah I mean for us  Like I said  I was just saying  I was in the fetal position  Watching these episodes  Because they are so raw  And they deal with  Real stuff that's going on  In our lives  And so whether it's  The family issues that we had  We have a lot of  Different health issues  We've been dealing with  In our family  My parents live with us  By the way  Oh my god  What's wrong with you?  No no no  You can't  Oh that laugh  Right  I forgot a flipper  We forgot about the laugh  Yeah  Rings out like a song 
[01:35:30]  Oh that's nice  Wow  Kevin's here by the way  And I hear he's a fan of the show  He is  Is that real though?  You don't understand  Are you kidding me?  No I'm not  We hear that all the time  Oh no no  And then we question the person  I will tell you  He's the one  You guys are the ones  That got us into  The TLC show  With Paola  Oh right on  90 Day Fiancé  90 Day Fiancé  Nice  Holy moly  We were listening  And you guys were talking about it  Every week  Yeah  And I would break down  My opinions on the show  And you guys of course  Were breaking down yours 
[01:36:00]  And now  I have to send him  Sexy pictures of myself  To pretend I'm Paola  Because he wants Paola  That's all  This is a whole other show  This is just creepy  90 Day Fiancé  Did you see it?  And I'm obsessed with Chef Nick  I mean we like  Well 90 Day Fiancé  We never talked about the finale  Because it was a bust  I didn't have to watch  90 Day Fiancé  Because I would listen to it  On this show  And this is like  It turned into one of those  There's certain movies  On Mystery Science Theater  Where it's like  Unless you watch it  With the commentary  It's not worth watching  So that's why 
[01:36:30]  It really was  There's no worth  They all ended up  Getting married  And there was no conflict  I was shocked  It was a big bust in the end  I wanted one guy  To like really  Like the Cleveland guy  Suffer  To look like  Fucking private pile  From Full Metal Jacket  Like I really wanted him  To get his stupid heart broke  But no  She's trying to be a nice girl  There was nothing  It's been a short amount of time  Right  It takes time for divorce  To get his money  It's got to take time  Well there was so much  That you thought  Was going to happen  But Pa was a legit  That was  I mean with that one  I couldn't believe 
[01:37:00]  That was legit  They fell in love  Down in South America  Right  I think they were a legit couple  Yeah  The other ones were  You know  Obviously for citizenship  I thought the Russian girl  Was flying the coop  Seriously  Oh boy did I  But you know what's funny  She seemed  Like so disconnected  From him  And that this was all  A sham for sure  Right  And I think that's just  How they edited it  To make it look dramatic  Because when you see her  In the wedding episode  Even though they played up  The whole vomit thing  And she was so sick  And she couldn't do it  I was dying because  When you see her  Because of you guys  How else would we have heard  About this show 
[01:37:30]  I know  Can you guys make people  Watch our show  Because you made us  Watch this show  You know  That's not a bad idea  Yeah  You can help you guys out  You gotta be okay  With him ripping it apart  Yeah that's the problem  We can't be nice  It doesn't matter  Be nice socks  That scene worked perfectly  Oh that was terrific  I can't wait to see  The next scene  That's what makes you  Want to tune in  Yeah  So you have to take  The go of the bath  You kind of want to see  Disasters  You have to know  You'll see  Love us  They should  I thought it was  Like a paid hit  Every week  I'm like  How is this going on  By the way 
[01:38:00]  That's actually a good scam  I wish it was  You guys should work  With the network  So we'll talk about  Your show every week  I'm all about  The envelopes  Don't tell him  He'll bring you a bag  Every week  Keep talking  You gotta be careful though  Because like I said  There was no point  I didn't need to watch  90 Day Fiancé  Because  Yeah we talked about  We watched it here  On the radio  It was a better show  On the radio  Although the weirdo  On his honeymoon  Trying to have sex  For the first time  Oh my god  That was creepy  That was creepy 
[01:38:30]  Oh my god  They were just kind of  Looking at each other  Like so let's just cuddle  So I guess we're gonna do it  We never did this before  I wanted to have this closeness  Oh my god  She was great  We've decided we're not gonna wait 90 days  We're gonna do it in six  How about I lock this in right now  Because someone throw me a life preserver  At this point  They gussied her up like a model  And he was like  Oh I'm losing this girl  So he got married right away  Oh really  He didn't need the 90 days  When he saw what could possibly happen 
[01:39:00]  He knew every day  Was one more day  She could find someone else  That was much more worthy  She pretty much kept asking  Where's Johnny Depp  Exactly  How insecure was he though  Like one guy winked at her  On Hollywood Boulevard  He's like  Alright alright  Let's go  Next weekend  I don't like you talking to him  I don't want you  There was a Johnny Depp  Come on  Here comes the ride  Come on  Yeah  That was brilliant  Star 80  But in Hawaii man  What kind of sex  Do you think that was  Probably not good  Because she's beautiful  But she wouldn't turn me on  Because she was too innocent  And nice 
[01:39:30]  And like  That wouldn't do it for me  Yeah you need a little filth  Well no no no  The problem was  Because  The problem was  You actually  No no no  I think a guy would find that sexier  He was just  Not the person to lead her  Right  Because then you can lead her  Where you want her to go  And then that would be high  Yeah they were both  Just inept  Like this weird Svengali  Like I'm going to build this one  From the ground  First a couple of words  In Italian  If you know what I mean  Getting back to your show 
[01:40:00]  You said something in there  About editing  Yeah  Are you alright with the edits  They're doing with you guys  Yeah I mean here's the thing  For me  When I'm like saying  I was in the fetal position  It's because it's so raw  I mean we're fighting about  Various things  And going at each other  Really hard in it  And then you've got  The fact that  You know we had some  Health crisis  Crises in there  We've got  The you know  The courtship of ours  That was ruined  And how all that  Kind of happened  So that people will understand  Why we didn't get married  15 years ago 
[01:40:30]  We go back to Boston  And kind of  Where everything went wrong  And all  We really like  Delve into things  Right  And so  It's hard as  Someone who knows television  To say  Cut that  I'm uncomfortable  Because when you are uncomfortable  It generally means it's good  Right  That's the good stuff  So I think that the show  Because we were so raw and honest  Because I wouldn't do it otherwise  Because what's the point  To me like I'm on TV every day  I don't need that  Especially if it's going to be  Yeah so why are you doing it 
[01:41:00]  Well if you do it  You're going to say  I'm serious  No we were terrified to do it  We were  But what was the reasoning  I'll tell you  Because this guy  Tell them  Which version do you want me to tell?  We used to  I will not name names  But we used to live next door  To a reality show family  A very successful one  The Mansons  And  Season 3  Kevin would be like  What the F are we doing wrong?  He goes  These people are living the life  They're having parties every day  They're drinking in their yard 
[01:41:30]  Having a great time  And we're working our balls off  Like why aren't we reality stars?  Right  Even though we still didn't want to be on camera  He's like  You need to do this  And I'm like  I'm not doing this  You're out of your mind  Right  And so we said no a million times  And then finally we were like  You know what  Maybe the very thing that we're resisting  Is the very thing we need  Because it actually forced me  To go home after extra  Be home with my family  Which to me is  You know  A dream  I saw the pause  I heard the pause in there  There was a pause 
[01:42:00]  There was a pause  There was a pause  Sorry Kevin  Sorry  So I mean  You know  All of a sudden  I was actually able to have a glass of wine  With my family  I'm like  This is kind of cool  Even though it's kind of creepy and scary  To have people in your house  Eventually they become family  And you get used to it  And then you're like  Sad they're leaving  It's like the Wizard of Oz  I was Dorothy  Like why are you guys leaving?  But I'll tell you  From a business standpoint  You know  The end of the business  Maria's in  The entertainment news business  I mean  You know  You talk to probably Sam  And the younger generation 
[01:42:30]  They're all getting the news on the phone  So like  In the last 15 years  We've just watched it  Right  It can be compressed and compressed  Like you guys in radio  You know  Look where  20 years  Tell me about it  To where it is now  So you know  You have to open yourself up  To other things  To get more eyes and ears  On Maria's brand  And you know  There's a risk involved  Obviously  And I was just  For me  Someone in the background  I wanted to take that risk  You know  Because  Like I said  I don't like where the business is going  You just sold me on the show  And now I'm going to watch  I thought it was going to be a fluff show 
[01:43:00]  No  Actually  No no no  Trust me  Because  I've seen those shows  Where they're like  Oh gee  Tom  Do you think we should go do this  Cut to  There they are  I'm like  I will hang myself  It will not happen  So it's not a sister reality  No  Where they give you guys things to do  I hate those shows  No  I'm not pole dancing  All of a sudden  I would actually probably get me viewers  But you know what I'm saying  That could work  No but when they  You know it's funny  When we were doing  They gave us some of the tips 
[01:43:30]  On the press and stuff  They were like  You know  To me especially  Don't say this  And don't say that  Well  Right  You know one of the things  They didn't want me to say  Uh oh  Here we go  No from the beginning  It was  They would walk in  And say  Okay today we're going to do  This this and this  And I'd be  Excuse me  And then Maria's dad  Who's an old school  Greek immigrant  Who like  You know  He'll fly off on the handle  In two seconds  You guys are going to fall in love  You can't tell this guy  Anything  You can't tell him what to say  You can't tell him  He's a very very stubborn guy  So he was even more so  Let me like  I'm not doing this  I'm not saying that  Right  And this was the battles  Back and forth 
[01:44:00]  And that's why the shoot  It was supposed to be  Two months  Because they probably thought  Like oh we'll shoot  Three or four days  You'll do x y and z  And then it went eight months  It did  Oh that's better  That's way better  Relax  You'll get the shit  You'll get the stuff  Just relax  It's there  But we want to be real  And I kept saying  Guys  I want the show to succeed  I'm not  Marie's already a star  I don't need to make  Maria a bigger star  I want the  We're in now  So we want the show to succeed  How's the show going to succeed  It's got to be real  You can't cook this  Oh good for you guys  Eight months is a great time 
[01:44:30]  That's why it went a long time  And there were days  That I would  I was pissed at Maria  About you know  One time  We were about to get  In a huge fight  And I just walked by  The producer said  You know they're shooting  Your dad in the garden  You know picking tomatoes  And I said  Do you guys want to get  Some real shit  Because I'm going in the gym  Right now  And I'm going to blast Maria  And if you really claim  To be reality show producers  You're going to grab those  And they did  No kidding  Oh yeah so  I blasted him back though  Oh that laugh  I forgot  As you might guess  Wow 
[01:45:00]  Anyway  But it's the only way  I think  I also think that  Everyone's smartening up  When you watch these shows  Yeah  Don't you guys know now  When it's cooked  Well I don't know  When those Kardashians  Go shopping  And they play like  The fucking midget  Entering music  I love that stuff  I used to love reality shows  And then it was obvious  They started filming these things  In like four to six weeks  Like the real world  That's where I started  With the  You know on MTV  And those things  Were six to eight  The challenge in the real world  Are still good  Because they're just  But they were six to eight months 
[01:45:30]  Right  And the show was  At least six to eight months  Well here's the thing  They just got smarter  And realized  You can still get  Enough crazy  In probably two months  They're still raw  Trust me  Because I've done  The after shows for them  And hosted their reunions  No real world is  But that's why  It's still compelling  In the challenge  And then you think  So we're smart enough  To know that  That's what works  It's cast too  Beautifully  These days  They get the beautiful  People cast  Not only is it cast too  Beautifully now  After season three  That's the one  Where they get  That was San Francisco  That was great 
[01:46:00]  But what happened was  Then they realized  Okay we just got to  Fill the seven categories  Yep  Right  And they just fill  Seven categories  With the hot version  Of that category  It's so obnoxious  And then so there's  No surprises anymore  Right  Someone's gonna say  They have the hardcore  Right wing Christian  And they have the  Kind of anarchist  And they have the  Babe and the  Gay guy  And then they just  Throw them together  And they go  Oh my god  The hardcore Christian  Got the gay guy sad  Can you believe this  It's a crisis 
[01:46:30]  It's like  Really like  Every other  Fucking season  You do  Yeah  And with us  We were like  When they were talking  And meeting all of our  Family and friends  One producer was like  She's too quiet  I don't like him  I'm like  Well I don't care  These are my real friends  And that's it  And by the way  Wouldn't it be great  To see my best friend  Since the seventh grade  And I  The way we normally are  When I go to Boston  Make out  I stay at her  I stay at her  I stay at her apartment  You know  We get into her pajamas 
[01:47:00]  My favorite thing  About going home to Boston  Is she always has the best  Big comfy warm pajamas  Slow down  Slow down  We eat our ice cream  Slow down  Oh man  Sounds like my friendship  With Pat  When we go in a pajama frenzy  Absolutely  He hates when I smell  The feety part of his  But it turns me on  But the best part about them  Is that it's all  They're all our authentic friends  And they're not  They're not  They actually end up  Being great characters  Because they're real  Joe of course  Joe just got harassed 
[01:47:30]  On Ellen the other day  Because I was on Ellen  Joe Geer is a guy  That's been my best friend  For about 20 years  And you know  Maria's as well  He's a big guy  Typical Boston guy  Tough  Straight shooter  He's been living with us  For 10 or 15 years  How big is this house?  It's like the circus car  All of a sudden  There's like more people  Coming out of the house  It's a big house  But the thing is with Joe  When they were doing 
[01:48:00]  The reality show  We you know Sunday  We get together for dinner  And they would tell Joe  No no no  And I said  He lives in our house  You don't find it compelling  That we have this big guy  From Boston  Who's been with us  For 15 years  And then I'm sorry  If you don't find it compelling  He's part of our family  He lives in the house  Joe get to the dinner table  And like these were like  They were going to try to tell you  Who to sit with  In your own house  Yeah because  You know  That's just how this is  But that's like I said  When you guys got around  Most of that it sounds like  Yeah  Because we were producers on it  But also Maria  I think because 
[01:48:30]  Thank God  She had the celebrity  So that  If we were  If we were situation  In Snooki season one  They would have rolled right over us  Good for you though  To not go the easy road with it  That's smart  Yeah  That does make it  That's like  Paris Hilton came in  Delightful interview  But she was really open  And fun  And really lovely  But she didn't  But how much Russian history  Can you talk about  That's the problem  I get it  I don't need to know  Every czar  Let's just  Let's talk about 
[01:49:00]  Fingernail polish  Maybe  Come on  Let's have fun  Sorry go ahead  There's absolutely  Nothing going on there  With her  But that's why  We were being nice too  She got pissed off  At us  Really quickly  Cranky  But I think that's why  It failed  Because it didn't feel  Revealing  And it didn't feel  It felt like  Assisted reality  Too much  There's certain things  They probably have to say  But how do you explain  The Kardashians  I hate that show  It's huge  And I have to say  In their defense  When I watch  Because I know them 
[01:49:30]  Very well  Oh you can't piss off  The Kardashians  I forgot  It's not that  No no  Because I wouldn't  I wouldn't bring it up  That's your business  But I do think  When I see  What's going on  In their real lives  They actually do  Play it out  So they  They are very well  That's why  They're so successful  You can't take that  Away from them  I think when I watch  The Mob Wives  I'm a fan of all  These shows  But the ones  That succeeded  It's the real essence  Of them is coming out  Right  So no matter  Where you stick  The Mob Wives  You can put them  In a coffee shop  And say  I don't talk 
[01:50:00]  About readers here  By the time  They're done  They're arguing  About something  That they're very  Passionate  That they believe  In  I think the Kardashians  Is the same way  Because you kind of  Know that the Kardashians  Were really rich  And this is not  A created life  Like this probably  Is their actual life  And even though  It's enraging  For the rest of us  That's how  This family lives  So maybe that's  The attraction to it  I don't watch it  But I guess  That's the attraction  I'm babbling  About nothing  I'm babbling  About nothing  I'm basically admitting  I don't know  What I'm talking about  But I'm saying  A lot of words  How about I just shut up  Yeah so hopefully  You guys will like it 
[01:50:30]  Like I said  We'll bring you  A couple bags  And you guys can talk  About it every week  What's it called?  Chasing Maria Menounos  Alright okay  And it's on TLC?  It's on Oxygen  Not own  Oxygen  Oxygen  Oxygen  At 10 o'clock  On Tuesday nights  Oxygen  How many episodes  You guys got?  10  Nice  That's nice  Yeah  Well I mean  90 Day Fiancé  Was what?  6?  That was 6 episodes  Oh my god  That was 6 episodes?  That was it  It was appointment TV  Though  We never missed it  And then we were  Listening to you guys  And Kevin's like  Okay I need your take 
[01:51:00]  Before we hear their take  Maria's got the go  Oh that was a good take too  I thought in the end  They were all going to be  A bust  Maybe I almost  Too soon  Too soon  Yeah  Do you think it's too soon?  Absolutely  And I also think  They'll revisit  And I wouldn't be surprised  If they don't throw  Pop Powell and then Michelle  Yeah  You know  Her following went up  Like 5 times  After once you guys  Mentioned  She's pretty happy  Oh she is delightful  Him not so much  She's a good follow  On Instagram  Literally Kevin  Every episode  I'd be like  Why can't you be more  Like Paola  And I'm like  What a great girl 
[01:51:30]  She is good  And those Instagram pics  Are very nice of her  So why didn't you guys  Ever get married?  Kevin  Kevin thinks he's  Going to get younger  Oh shit  I know  I always say  You know what  I think I can do better  I mean  I think it might be better  Oh Jesus Christ  Yeah that's a joke  But obviously  But the first year  Was as you'll see  With the show  We had a lot of conflict  And then after that  It was just like  Really why?  We were just so  We got busy  With our lives  And tired  And it was  Maria's career  Just exploded so much  And every year  It was like  Really a wedding  A wedding 
[01:52:00]  And now  We're married in our hearts  So it's like  The pointlessness of it  Maria wants something  Small and intimate  If I say do it  Then let's do it  Let's go with the  Wedding of the millennium  And this is where we fight  Okay so now that's the problem  So when I do get sentimental  Like Valentine's Day this year  It was the first Valentine's Day  I haven't worked  In a long time  So we actually spent  The day together  And I did get sentimental  And kind of romantic  Sorry  Even though I'm the dude  Sometimes  I'm such a dude  I looked at him like  Oh my god  I don't know  Maybe we should  And then my dad  Will get off my back  And so 
[01:52:30]  I was like  But the problem is  I  My idea of a wedding  Is get married  In a teeny church  On a cliff  In you know  An island in Greece  And  With just ten people  And his idea is  No  It's my day  I'm the bride  Absolutely  And I want  The Kardashian  Extravaganza wedding  And I'm like  For an introvert  Who doesn't leave his office  Like literally  He does not go out  Of like his realm  He's a bit agoraphobic  To want this massive wedding 
[01:53:00]  Just doesn't work  It doesn't make sense  I have a solution  Oh god  It's gotta move the needle  Why don't you do both  It's gotta move the needle  Have two ceremonies  Some people do that  Like they were doing  A 90 day fiance  They were gonna go  To Colombia  And have the second ceremony  So you have one little  Delightful one on a cliff  And then you have  The big bash  And everyone's happy  And my idea of a bash  Would be  Everyone come dress casual  I don't want everyone  Having to go buy out  Buy some outfit  And all that  Annoying stuff  I'd want a keg  Right  Well lots of kegs  I'd want like a keg party  Everyone comfy  But giant keg party  Yeah 
[01:53:30]  See I would make everybody dress  Like it was the renaissance  I want people  I want people  Spending a lot of money  On shitty clothes  That they'll never wear again  Oh it's like  Dangerous liaisons  Powdered wigs  Beauty spots  I am getting ideas  Yeah  Just don't  Just don't FaceTime  Your wedding  Like they did  On 90 day fiance  How brutal was that  They set up  Wait  The ceremonies  Were pretty lame  They set up a macbook  Are you kidding me  No no no  The poor Filipino girl  Who was marrying  What was his name  The  The guy with no money  Yeah  Louis 
[01:54:00]  Louis  Louis  Okay  When they ever went  To that little like  Hall that they were  Going to have it at  And the guy was like  Going over the menu  And she's looking around  She's just like horrified  I was like  Oh my god  Yeah  How is it worse  Than where she came from  That is true  How do you do that  How do you do that  To a Filipino broad  Yeah  It was crazy  She couldn't get  Her wedding dress  I know  They couldn't  I was like  Oh my god  I'll pay for her wedding dress  Please  Let me chip in  What was it  $200 you couldn't afford 
[01:54:30]  I think it was  Yeah  Oh god  That was so uncomfortable  She was so hot  In the Philippines  Then she came over  And she looked like  Chow Yun fat  And he was like  You know what  I prefer not to do this  God we love that show  We might have loved it  A little too much  I know  But I agree  I think the final episode  Was a bit of a letdown  Yeah we never did it  Because they were all happy  But see now  That's where we wanted  Some scripting  Because wouldn't it have been nice  If they forced the Russian girl  To like not show up  Like that would have been cool  Yeah or tell them 
[01:55:00]  It's disgusting smoking  Is really turning her off  Siggy  Siggy brat  I love it to be outside  Sucking down a Siggy  And then roll in  Fucking smoke around  His head like pig pen  But they'll do another season  Of that  They have to  I think so  Yeah but they'll have to find  Somebody that like  Is really in it  For the wrong reason  Yeah of course  Because otherwise  It's not as entertaining  I don't want to watch that again  I was convinced  Jim Norton  Sitting right here  There's your next season  That is true  I would love to do that  And then you ditch her  Oh my lord  You're the one that vanishes  Where'd he go 
[01:55:30]  Right  Kevin what's your career  In this whole thing  I own an online broadcast network  Called After Buzz TV  So we produce after shows  For all your favorite TV shows  So that's why I want you  To tell me about 90 Day  It was like  How did I miss this  Because I  That's why we watch TV  And we have 200 hosts  That do these after shows  That report on all the shows  It's an online thing  Online broadcasting  Yes we have video audio  Where is it  We're actually the first  And now we're the largest online  Where is it now  LA  We're out in LA  No I mean  The website  AfterBuzzTV.com  I'll check it out  Our stuff's on YouTube  iTunes  I mean like the model we have  Is the early model for 
[01:56:00]  Someday  If you  When you guys ever  Would want to walk away  From this  You could easily  I've told Sam this many times  You guys could set up  So quickly out of a  Literally out of a garage  The way Corolla does it  Except with us  We're also audio  And live streaming  He's just  I mean excuse me  We're video and live streaming  He's audio  Yeah we need the video angle too  It's obvious  It's so obvious to us  And you guys were the pioneers of that  And then you got away from it  No kidding  I think you just pulled the cord  Too early you know  It wasn't us  We didn't pull no cord  They pulled it  They did  They wouldn't let you  Yeah  No they took all  You kind of plug it back in  They took all the cameras out 
[01:56:30]  We were on our way  Yeah  This merger was the worst thing  To happen to us  Why did they do that?  That doesn't make sense  But by the way  You could contract you  If you wanted to set  Your own stuff up  You could do that  Or could they stop you?  We're allowed to take Polaroids  And show them to friends  Don't ask permission  Just ask for forgiveness  They're going to bring  A caricature artist in  Yeah  I'm surprised  I'm surprised we're still  Allowed to Instagram  At this point  Yeah  It's unbelievable  They want to just control this  It's like no  There's so much more to this 
[01:57:00]  And then try to figure out  How to make money out of it  I mean because the show  Is still growing  I know you guys  Don't realize it  But I will say  The thing that's  That's great about  When you have  That kind of resistance  Because I've experienced it  For 14 years  In various situations  In various ways  Where everyone wants  To hold you down  You literally get  So resourceful  At creating a way  To get around it  Right  That you get so much smarter  And there's just  It's kind of  Kind of a great 
[01:57:30]  A better way to do it  Rather than having it all  Come easily  And having everyone be like  Oh you can have  Whatever you want  Right  Then you're kind of  You're left to afterwards  Like say something happens  You don't really know  How to kind of survive later  Right  It's weird  I don't know if I'm  Explaining it properly  No but I think a lot of guys  Have gotten an easy ride  In the business  Even in our business  And then all of a sudden  When the bottom gets pulled out  It's called shit hits the fan  Yeah  And they don't know what to do  But I think sometimes  When you have the adversity  Then you figure it out  And I know it bums you guys up  So I guess we gotta leave  In October  Here's what I've also learned too 
[01:58:00]  Like at some point  When you realize  That you're not gonna get  Any wind for your sail  Then it forces you  To create these other opportunities  That you would never have done  Right  And then you soar  So it's like  It shows you  You know what  Maybe I don't belong here  Wherever here is  And that's okay  Maybe this is the brick  From the sky  That's telling me  I need to forge a new path  Is that a Bette Midler song?  It isn't  Yes, you are the brick  Beneath my wings  That isn't a Bette Midler song 
[01:58:30]  Do you ever know  That you're my brick?  Yeah  You know what's so frustrating  About these guys  Is they have fans on YouTube  That put together videos  When they go over  Like a Joe Piscopo thing  Or that Happy Days episode  They'll match  Your radio  To the video  And it's  God damn brilliant  It's right there  So if they had  The capability  To stream like  Okay  Go and watch  What we're watching  And we're going to  Comment on it  It's just so amazing  And with today's technology  It would be  So easy  I could set this whole place  Up for you guys  For such an alarmingly 
[01:59:00]  Small amount of money  We should talk  Absolutely  But I mean  I can't believe  That they would have  They would  I'm just befuddled  There's an opportunity there  It's obvious  Absolutely  Man wants to  I think with that  With Access  With Cuban's station  And Maria knows Mark  But I know you guys do too  Where he's only doing  That kind of live stuff  And I see some of the stuff  That's on there  Some of it's very good  Some of it's not  High quality  He needs  He needs better content  Then you have  Audience channel  Where Artie is  I mean there's a lot of places  This could go  On terrestrial television 
[01:59:30]  But then even online  And maybe  It's not all caught up yet  But the technology's there  And you guys obviously  Have the fan base  And the fan base  Keeps growing  Which is cool  They gave me a little crap  When I was doing live  From the compound  They don't even like that  Oh yeah  The Ustream thing  They did  A little bit  I have a CB radio thing  I have 40 truckers  The key is  Their whole  I'm not saying  Anyone in particular  But generally  Their goal is  To see if they can  Hold you down  To see if you will relent 
[02:00:00]  And be like  Fine  And there are the people  That will just keep  Bitching and bitching  And bitching  And never do anything about it  So as long as  You guys are the ones  That create these other  Holes quietly  Kevin calls them  Like building your bombs  Behind the scenes  You know  They think that  We're going to  Use content  That we would use here  But meanwhile  I was doing simulcasts  Of toddlers and tiaras  It's like  Yeah but it's what  You were doing to yourself  While you were watching  Yeah the picture in picture  Cross cam 
[02:00:30]  Is what bothered people  Was that the problem  Yeah  See I didn't  I didn't know  Too much content  On the next Mason  But seriously  I think you're going to  Create a win-win  That's the whole thing  It's not so much  Going around them  I think it's creating  A win-win scenario  So with Sirius  Is a publicly traded company  Their thing  If you notice  Which is why  They do some of the  Stunts that they do  To get publicity  Is because they always  Have to please a stockholder  So maybe it's  Gang video on this  And maybe it's just  The interviews that go up  On YouTube 
[02:01:00]  But having enough  Sirius swag around  So we always know  That the brand  Is always getting out there  I mean I just  There's a sensible way  To do this  You're too logical  I'm sorry  I can't listen to you  Wait until he gets you  Off the radio  Oh he's right  I'm going to talk to Tim Sabian  We've tried every angle  It's ridiculous  And then you see  Everyone else passing  Satellite radio by  These guys had a huge  Well Patton just already said  A huge lead on everyone  You have fans  That are already  Putting this stuff up  But they're not stopping  Right  The toothpaste is coming  Out of the tube  Anyway  So why not do it  And the fans are finding  Those YouTube channels 
[02:01:30]  That's why we  Have no problem  Watching a video now  Because it has  A whole life of its own  Now  I listen to YouTube  Thank you  The Joe Piscopo thing  That your fans put together  Is epic  It is a four and a half hour  Epic film  It's so gorgeous  Film  It really is  It's amazing  And you follow this whole story  And they put the whole thing together  That's great  Pictures and video  It's a masterpiece  One of the better days  In recent memory  Was when Anthony came in  And said  Guess what I saw 
[02:02:00]  I was like  I couldn't believe  What I was watching  We got weeks out of that  And then he came in  A couple times  The showtime special  The whole thing is on  YouTube  As one thing  It's a saga  It is a fucking saga  That's great  Of Club Piscopo  And may I just say  I cannot wait for you guys  To watch this Mason special  Yes  Because you are  That's going to be  A whole episode  And all I've got to say  Is when you watch it  Imagine if it came out today  It would shut a network down 
[02:02:30]  The outrage  Absolutely  And it was a fun family  Cute  A little fun  Why not  This is Mason Reese  Yes  What about Mason Reese  I heard it on the way in here  I'm like wait  How do we get a Mason Reese reference  Exactly  He had a pilot  Because he was really popular  In the 70s  So they shot a pilot  And he was an adorable kid  Really smart  And they shot this pilot  Yeah quirky looking  Interesting  And this pilot  It is the most casual  Kind of child molesty humor 
[02:03:00]  Child molesty  It was like  It was like an ABC family pilot  But you're  Yeah  Again  I'm actually underselling it  I'm not telling you  What is coming down the pipe  When you get halfway through the episode  And go  Is this the plot  This can't be the plot  I love it  Yeah  Yeah we'll do that  I think we've got to get you guys out of here  It was the white Rodney Allen  Is that true?  No we don't want to go  This is hot  Oh you don't have to go  I don't know what we have to do  We heard you  I need a new ringtone  Would you laugh again please?  Sorry  Oh wait  Oh wait 
[02:03:30]  I found someone with the most ridiculous laugh  At the airport  I wish  I wish Pat was here  And you challenged them  For supremacy?  It was the TSA guy  And I thought I insulted him  At one point  Because I was like  Oh my god  He has the worst laugh  It's even worse than mine  And then I'm like  Oh my god  He could get me in trouble  And I didn't even realize  Oops  What was he laughing  I probably have wires he found  In someone's show  I was telling Kevin  I'm like  He should do drops  For radio or something  Because he was like  Like that  At the airport  I'm like  It's already creepy enough  Like when we're flying  Because we're so scared 
[02:04:00]  Right yeah  To have that  To have that creepy  And then it ended up  He's like  People always get scared  Of my laugh  And I'm like  Yeah  Because it's creepy  I go  And then people think  Mine sounds like a machine gun  The two of us  Would be bad  To get there  Evil  Now for the body cavity  I wish we had  Because we recorded it  We recorded it  Yeah  You did do  Yeah it was amazing  I'm like  I need this in my life  Now what part of Boston  Are you guys from  And how did you meet  Medford Mass  Oh Medford  Medford  I almost heard the accent there  Yeah  Medford  Oh yeah  I have a hot cold accent  The problem is 
[02:04:30]  When I'm drunk or tired  It comes out  Oh there you go  Do you try to hide it  Because like  Newscasters always try to  Keep their accents down  So they don't have  Like a location  Right right  I didn't try to lose it  What happened was  When I went on camera  The first time in college  It went away  Because I felt like  I had to be like professional  It was like something  That came over me  And then eventually  It just stuck  Because I would go in and out  So when I'd be on camera  It would be gone  And then when I'd be back  To being you know  My regular self  It would come back  Yeah so producers  Would get so nervous  Because they'd be like 
[02:05:00]  Don't talk like that  On camera  I'm like I don't know  But it goes away on camera  Don't make me nervous  So  Wow yeah I can really hear it  When you like  When you like  Consciously don't  Right  Yeah  And how'd you guys meet  College  It's such a beautiful accent  I met him  It's wicked  It's wicked  Yeah why aren't you  Phone sex with that accent  I'm taking my top off  Yeah who's your little  Cork sucker  That was the biggest shock 
[02:05:30]  When we went to Boston  To do radio  Was how they talk  How the hell  Are we going to fit in  With this  I'm grabbing your cock  Oh hang on hang on  The Celtics game is on  God damn it  What's your block  That little defense  Sorry  Alright  As you guys know  No more loyal fans  Because you guys in Boston  They embraced us  That was pretty cool  My favorite city  I love Boston  They were great  I miss Boston  I don't know if you guys agree  Because you know  You've been here for a while too 
[02:06:00]  But Boston food is the best  In what way  Every way  Yeah  I still have yet to have  Good pizza from this place  And everyone talks about  New York pizza  John's pizza  John's  In the West Village  There's no good pizza  Wherever I go  I just find the same  I just named one  It's always old  And dry  And it just sits there  For hours  And days  And weeks  The Sabaro family  In their little  Times Square location  Sparrow  What's they going on  Sparrow  Steak and cheese subs  Oh  Remember steak and cheese subs 
[02:06:30]  Colin and I go to a place  It's right off  It's by the Comedy Cellar  It's off 6th Avenue  I don't know if it's  John's is the place  Where you can only order a pie  Right  John's  Yeah this is not that place  It's right around the corner  From there  Well they better learn  How to make pizza  If they're near John's  I follow this guy  On Instagram  He was a producer  Of The Chew  We just did a segment  With him the other day  And it's like NYC food guy  Or something  So I follow him  And I start taking notes  When I come to New York  I can actually find good places  I swear to you  You gotta ask Roland  Okay  Roland you give him a type  He'll tell you the best  And off the top of his head 
[02:07:00]  It's creepy  I want really amazing pizza  Well he said  In Connecticut  Is the best pizza in the country  And not pay for thin pizza  Like I want real awesome  Pizzeria Regina pizza  Pepe's in Connecticut  I've never been there  I think that's what it's called  He'll tell you  It's in New Haven  And it's supposed to be  The best pizza anywhere  Really?  On the way home  We'll go get some  No here comes your answer  Right now  Roland knows everything  Best pizza  Don't screw me  Because I will tell people publicly  That you picked the wrong pizza place  In New York City 
[02:07:30]  Ruby Rosa  Ruby Rosa?  Where's that?  At 235 Mulberry Street  See?  Honey will you remember that?  He knows  It's literally  The best pizza  It's thin but not too thin  Yeah  And the sauce is amazing  And it's actually pepperoni from Italy  What about the place in Connecticut you love?  Oh, Pepe's  Can you write both of those down for me?  Yeah, Pepe's is delicious  We're serious about our pizza  Which is better?  So you're going to go down  It's too different though  New Haven pizza is totally different than New York pizza  Would you go to Little Italy just to try the pizza now?  I mean, yeah  I would go  Yeah, I'd go wherever  As long as time permits 
[02:08:00]  I'm down  It's all about the quest for good food  When we have time off  Right  How do you stay so thin?  How do I stay so thin?  Yes, darling  Stress  Because I'm a tornado  Is that it?  Yeah  Work it off?  I just move  I'm always moving  At top speed  Well, at Extra  They don't  It's probably what?  A half a mile from the set  To where you guys shoot  I actually got my best body working at Extra  Because we have to walk so far to get to set  And I don't take golf carts or whatever  Generally  I'm like  Everywhere I go  I'm moving at top speed 
[02:08:30]  But then you get sweaty  Oh, boy  Not really  Luckily, I'm not a sweaty person  Yeah  All right  We should get him out of here  Not before we talk about Chef Nick  Because I'm obsessed  Who's Chef Nick?  Chef Nick  I don't know  You guys introduced us to this  It was the YouTube  I don't remember  Oh, my God  The fake chef  The fake chef  Yeah, of course  Yeah, of course  Anything  Do you guys remember?  Anything more brilliant than this guy?  How do we get this guy to do more?  Yeah, I know  He's really good  He's one of those like culture jammer pranks 
[02:09:00]  So he'll pop up when he's ready  Yes  He takes his time  Yeah, he wakes  Like Al-Qaeda  He just takes it  I know  Thank you for introducing us  We know improv everywhere is Al-Qaeda  We just don't know  He's pranksing him  Distraction  I mean  What's your theory on the plane, Maria?  Wow  I actually asked my assistant to do research for me  To see if Obama or any of our top officials have canceled events this week  Because that would let us know that something seriously crazy is going on behind the scenes 
[02:09:30]  That we're not being alerted to just yet  There's no Super Bowl this week  Maria got her star with Nightly News  And that's the hardcore journalist Roots Dateline  And there's all this other today's show  They can read us  So she always keeps me up on this stuff  I mean, the fact that it was in the air for so many hours is very creepy  Yeah  Concerning  And the other thing is that they said  I think it was Stephanie Goss that reported that the pings  Only continue when they're in over water  That when you hit land, they stop 
[02:10:00]  Really?  Whoa  I'm pretty sure that's what it was  I have to double check that  I wonder why that is  Oh, maybe because it's so easy to get lost in  Well, there's like  It happens every  However, you know  There's like a  Every hour or whatever  When you have a ride  It's weird  We're going to talk to Patton's father about this  After the break  Yes  Call him my dad  Ex-marine guy  Yes  We have marine pilots  We'll call him my dad  Yeah, well  And they stayed within those aviation  I call them buoys  The little buoys  In the air 
[02:10:30]  In the air  I mean  Yeah  They're lanes  Air lanes  Yeah  Air lanes  It's really scary  Because if this is the  You know  What a smart question though  What politicians have cancelled  Any type of  That's a smart angle to look at  Tricks of the trade  I guess, right?  Yeah  I was just kind of  Googling in quotes  Missing planes  Something would pop up  That'd help me  Yeah  Well, because nobody wants to scare people  You know  And then especially  If this plane has been hijacked 
[02:11:00]  And is somewhere on land  And you know  But we're sophisticated enough  To know that by now  We would know by now  You think?  Yeah  I think so  I don't know  You know  What's crazy is when you guys  Were talking about  I don't think we were that sophisticated  You know  Third world country  And you know  They don't have the means  To really kind of  Lead this investigation  Yeah  It makes me wonder  As a journalist  When I'm traveling  To all these countries  How scary  I put myself in these situations  Traveling on these random airplanes  In these random countries  Don't you feel better though?  Like I looked at the plane  It was like  It's painted nicely  They could afford to have the best equipment 
[02:11:30]  Just because the paint job is nice  I'm thinking  It's safe  Right  Well apparently though  This was a 777  And the pilot  These are the elite of the elite planes  And the pilots that get to fly them  Are the elite of the elite  So this wasn't some  I think what's freaking people out  Is we are so used to  Everything is available all the time  Because of iPhones  Because of the internet  So for something this big  To be missing  That's what's scrambling our heads 
[02:12:00]  Right  Is well we should just be able to  Can we just  I mean  There's a part of it  It's like  We should just be able to do a Google search  And find it  Yeah  But no  It's still a giant world  In places that we don't know  Where things are  You're saying it's not one of those planes  Where it's like  Have a good flight  Dr. Jones  The chickens  But you guys were right too  I don't remember who was saying it this morning  I think I was  What's  What's  Again  You know  Who's to say that someone didn't show up at this pilot's house 
[02:12:30]  Oh yeah  We were talking about that  Give them a little what have you  An early hijacking of him  But you know  These pilots  When they get into the cockpit  There's so many kind of ways  That they could signal  I think  Without someone knowing  But what if  The person's highly trained  And they're watching  And they know  What they're going to do  I mean it's  Or you just turn the guy  Yeah  Maybe they were  You're saying it your way  You know what  Yeah I like your way  You don't have to crash it  Just land it here  Josh is saying  From Boston  The planes  She's talking about  Continue over land and water 
[02:13:00]  But stop when they go underwater  The pit  That's what he's saying  Oh  Oh  So that means  It could have crashed  That's if he's right  That's if he's right  Of course  Of course  Because I already said  I'm like  I think this is what I heard  I was at 100%  Right  Me and Pat's having a heart attack  And then we have to go  Oh yeah  You guys are busy  Wait, Pat Lambert  Can he bring the creepy laugh in  So they can hear it  No, Maria  We got to go  You guys are late  You guys hear it  All right, listen  It's called  Chasing Maria 
[02:13:30]  On Oxygen  Tuesdays at 10 o'clock  Yes  Nice  And you can watch her  On Extra  Every night  During the week  Right  Extra  Extra  Extra  Have you met any celebrities?  I think a few  Did you do red carpet  For the Oscars?  Yeah  Is that cool?  Yeah  It was actually  You know what  For Oscars  I generally just do the fashion  So I'm above  It's a little easier  I can be in my Uggs  And not have to  Have the pressure  Of interviewing everyone  Just looking at everyone's fashion 
[02:14:00]  Well, those are always  Comfortable, genuine interviews  They do  It's really nerve-wracking  And even seasoned interviewers  Are having trouble  With the actors  Because they're all  Panic-stricken  And it's really  Awful  But do you still  Panic when you have to interview  Or feel the pressure  Of interviewing?  No  I mean  It depends on what  What you're interviewing about  And what the situation is  I mean  For the most part  You know what you're doing  If you're prepared  And you do your deal  Nice  Although Guillermo  Was getting everyone drunk  At the end of the red carpet  I went up to him  And he started interviewing me  And I was like  What are you drinking? 
[02:14:30]  I smell it on your breath  And he goes  You want tequila shot?  I'm like  Alright  Wow  So I think that calmed people down  For the rest of the carpet  Bunch of goddamn drunks  Alright let's get him out of here  Bye guys  Thank you so much  Thanks for coming on the show  I hope you guys like the show  Thank you so much  Take it easy  Good luck  Good luck with the show  Patton Oswalt's father  Next  Yes  That's a big get  Get to the bottom of this  That's a huge get  Opie and Anthony  Have been creating  Radio Gold  For 20 years  Not bad

[02:23:00]  But she's bored  Wants to try to  Do different  And new things  We got Patton's father  On the line  We've been teasing this  For like two hours  Sorry  Dad  Yeah how you doing  Hey  What's up  It's your oldest son  Patton  The one that went  Into show business  And broke your heart  Yeah  Yeah  Hello sir  Good morning  Good morning  It's Anthony  And Opie  And Jim Norton  And your son  And you on the phone  Yes  Yes 
[02:23:30]  That's what's happening  Dad  Sorry  We got a little  Of your background  From Patton  A Vietnam pilot  Yeah  F4 Phantom  Yeah  Pretty god damn cool  I'd say right there  No computers  Yeah  And that's right  You really had to fly that day  Seat of your pants  Flying right there  Right  A little bit  Nice  A little bit  And you also  We're an investigator  An accident investigator  That's true  Yeah  Was that for the 
[02:24:00]  Was that for the marines  That was for the marines  It was in the marine corps  And the navy  I went through  Puss grab scoop  It's like okay  Let's look at this crash  Oh  A missile hit it  It's like oh  That's  A meteor  A meteor  Well that's okay  Thank you for mentioning meteor  They are speculating  You talked me down  After 9-11  When I was getting  A little freaked out  About all that  Conspiracy stuff  You went no  This is what happens  And this 
[02:24:30]  Airliner  This missing  777  Is getting spookier  And creepier  And I was going to  Call you about this anyway  But I figured  Why not do a public service  And let them  And go on the radio  With you  And maybe you could  Help us  Talk us through  Some of this craziness  Because they've been  Talking about it all morning  And it's getting weirder  And weirder  We panicked people  Yeah  Well and panicked everybody  Yeah  Well you know  First the thing  Everybody's got  They've got to  Quit making  All the assumptions  They've got to 
[02:25:00]  Run with the facts  Right  And they've got to  Keep a  The first thing  They train you  Is don't  You know  That pilot was a drunk  I'm sure it was his fault  No you've got to  Go find the facts  And find me what happened  The  The  The other thing  Is they're  Flying in areas  That aren't really  A whole lot of  Airplanes up there  And we all know that  So  They  They operate off  These transponders  That's how they  Track them  The radar  Is very limited  So  They call it 
[02:25:30]  Skin paint  So when they said  They thought  The thing  Turned left  You read that  It's  It's really  That's only  A real guess  It's not for sure  Even that part's a guess  I thought that  I thought that was  An actual  They knew that  For sure  Well they think  That's true  But the one thing  That  I thought of first  Was the  On these airliners  They have  The airplanes  Send data  Up through the satellites  Back to  Home base 
[02:26:00]  Probably in Boeing  Or somewhere  To keep track  Of engines  To make sure that  They don't have  Just problems  With them  And  They say  That kept coming  So what that means  Is that won't work  Underwater  So that means  The airplane  Was in the air  And if they can  If they prove that  Then they've got to  Go out and figure out  Where this  Where this damn thing  Went in  I  777 is a very  Large airplane  And you're not  Going to land it  On a dirt strip  Somewhere  You've got to be 
[02:26:30]  On a regular airport  So  You know  So it's going to be  Probably somewhere  In the water  But so you don't think  That someone stole it  And landed it  On a little island  That didn't happen  Boy  I would like to know  What island  Oh really  Because  I don't  There's not a tailhook  On it  So they can't land  On a carrier  You know what I mean  Right  How about Pakistan  If they were close enough  To get to Pakistan  If they did disable it  If they got to Pakistan  That would  You know  That's true  And they should  Of course  Look into that  But I 
[02:27:00]  You know  The other thing  That's very strange  Is nobody's saying anything  Yeah  Yeah  That's  Everyone's looking  At this point  That's odd  And when you say  Nobody's saying anything  You mean no governments  No nothing  Is that weird?  No people say  Who claimed they did this  Or stuff like that  Oh okay  Right  No one claiming responsibility  But if they have future plans  For that plane  Which we talked about this morning  Like to do something bad with it  Like Anthony raised  The point of loading it  With something  And flying it into something 
[02:27:30]  You've already got hostages  There's definitely a reason  They wouldn't have  Claimed responsibility yet  Yeah  That's true  But I would  And I'm sure  I'll put it  I'm sure  They're exploring that  They're looking at  All the possibilities  Maybe they're not saying  A whole lot about that  But I mean  Right now  The whole thing  Is to find  Where that thing  Went down  And right now  They don't have a clue  It's just odd  That also the transponder  Was turned off  They said  In a very purposeful fashion 
[02:28:00]  There were two of them  On there  Yeah  With the other one  Being shut off  14 minutes later  Which seems like  A calculated  Kind of move  Sure  The lack of debris  A week later  Not washing up  Somewhere  Anything  There's a lot of  Floating parts  On those planes  That's a little  Mysterious  That's true  Did you note  In the paper  I mean  If you look at the map  How far that thing  Could have flown  Yeah  Well Patton said  That it's amazing  How much bigger  The search radius 
[02:28:30]  Is getting  Every day  They keep changing  The search radius  Which that in itself  Is a little creepy  Right  To me  Bigger and bigger  It is getting bigger  And you know  I would have  You know  I don't know  I don't have any  Inside on this  But I'm sure  The intelligence guys  Are also looking  At all the aspects  You're talking about  Right now  Well again  Here's my next question  Who's  Who would you most  Listen to  Who makes the next  Statement 
[02:29:00]  Because every day  The news speculates  And the White House  But who's  Who is the person  That we should actually  Be waiting to hear  Speak  That will actually  Have some impact  Or wait  Well right now  The  Pilot  The responsibility  Is Malaysia  That's their airplane  That's their problem  However  We have our  FAA is in there  With them  And our national  Transportation  Safety board  They have  Those people  Are in there  And I think  They're going  To settle  They've made  A lot of calls 
[02:29:30]  That you know  Were sort of  Bad at first  Those people  Should settle  Them down  To make  You know  Good information  Coming out of there  Oh okay  I think that  You're going to  Get people  With sources  Saying  I heard this  I heard that  I would sort of  Steer away from that  But you know  Take it in on one side  But understand  That they're  It may not  Turn out that way  Even if there's  An inkling  That it was  Taken  For you know  Evil  Evil use 
[02:30:00]  Sure  You would think  The United States  Would immediately  Put this  Kind of on a top  Priority  Well I believe  I believe  I understand  There's a number  Of US ships  Over there  I'm sure our  Satellites are  Looking for it  Okay right now  Yeah yeah  And we don't even  Know that maybe  Some of our  People with  High flyers  Are out looking  Right  So yeah  I think  I think we're  Really under  The coverage  You think a lot  Of stuff is going  On that isn't  Being told  To the public 
[02:30:30]  Yeah  I do  How hard  Would it be  For them  If that plot  Is correct  If Anthony  Was correct  Which he doesn't  Sound as crazy  As I thought  It would  How impossible  Would it be  For them to fly  From that part  Of the world  To the United States  Undetected  It would be  Pretty hard  Even without  Transponders  Yeah  Something would  Pick them up  And also  My question is  Let's say  Again Anthony's  Right  And they  Stole the plane  How expensive  Is it to refuel 
[02:31:00]  A 777  Would they have  Those resources  They'd have to  Have a  What are they  They carry  100,000 gallons  I'm not sure  What  I mean  They carry  A lot of fuel  Nice built in pool  Pounds  Not gallons  Pounds  That's how they do it  It takes a lot  Of fuel  To fill that puppy  Yeah  And they wouldn't  Have access  To that necessarily  Yeah  And they'd probably  Have to have  Some special  Ground support equipment  With some  Saudi money maybe  I'm blaming  The Saudis already 
[02:31:30]  There's never been  Any proof  Other than  Everything we've  Ever heard  That would  Lead us to  Believe that  There are  Terrorist supporters  A few million  Bad apples  A few million  Bad apples  Is my favorite  Tough crowd line  Ever  It's a real  Mystery right now  But I feel  That there are  A lot of things  Going on  That we don't  Know about  And it's probably  Best not to  Know about  Can you think  Of any  Recent or  Modern day  At least  Occurrences  That kind of 
[02:32:00]  Look like this  Where a plane  Has just disappeared  Like this  There was one  I'm trying to  There was an  Ethiopian airplane  One time  They had  A problem like this  And they  They wanted  To go somewhere  And they  Got there  And they  Wouldn't let them  Land  And they had  To crash into  Water  Wait is that  The one that  Was hijacked  And the pilot  Told them  We don't have  Enough fuel  And there's  Film of it  Going into the  Ocean  Oh my gosh  Yeah that was  Just a bad move  The pilots  Told them  We're not  Going to make 
[02:32:30]  It  That was the  One right  Off the shore  Right  Yeah  I don't recall  And the other  One with the  Egyptians  The suicide one  Yeah  That happened  And that  Was real quick  And everybody  You know  They knew that  But that's  The only one  I can  Think of  I can't  Yeah I can't  Really recall  A plane  Disappearing like  This  There's a lot  Of  There's a lot  In this  That is a  Kind of  Unprecedented  Just in the  Terms of  It's  It's such  A gigantic  Plane  And everybody  Is looking  For it now  And they 
[02:33:00]  Can't find  When everybody  Starts looking  For something  They tend  To find it  Right  Sooner or later  And nothing's  Happening  So that's  Also  What's a little  Weird  You know  You know  You know  The Air France  Guy  They took  Right  Took two years  To pull it up  Now it took  They found it  But it wasn't  Immediate  It took a while  To find that  Thing too  But they were  Getting some  Debris that was  Washing up  Right  Right  Beforehand  Which  They found some  Debris out in  The water  Yeah they kind  Of led them  To believe  Okay this is  What happened  The total  Lack of debris 
[02:33:30]  Is really  Puzzling  Yeah  That's weird  Nothing washing  Up on shore  Well unless  They went to  An area where  They haven't  Looked yet  Right  That search  Area  You know  Yeah  Right well  A lot of  Blue ocean  Out there  I have one  More question  For you too  Like we  Watched a  Great documentary  About flight  800 TWA  And I'm not  A conspiracy  Guy at all  But the way  This documentary  Was done  It painted  A much better 
[02:34:00]  Picture for the  Fact that something  Took the plane  Down than I  Would have  Thought  What do you  Know about that  Or what's  Your opinion  On that  The only  Thing I  Comment on  The head  Investigator  I listened  To him  He made  A news  Conference  And he  Said that  That is  Absolute false  He said  They had  They are  Very solid  That they  Know  That was  The one  The fuel  Tank blew  Up on it  Correct  And they  Felt very  Comfortable  In it  And this  Guy  Has got  A great 
[02:34:30]  Track record  And background  And I  Believe him  Okay  He's not  Going to  Go turning  On one  Of his  Own  That's  For sure  They don't  Do that  Hoorah  Hoorah  Semper  Fine  But the  Big thing  They got  To do  Is just  Don't make  A whole  Bunch of  Assumptions  Just go out  And look  At every  Little piece  And run  It down  Until you  Get to  Where you  Are  And you  Know  Look at  All aspects  That's what's  Creeping  Everyone out  Is we have  All these  Half assumptions  And your  Brain can  Fill them 
[02:35:00]  In  And these  Some of  The pundits  On tv are  Awful  The what  Some of  The pundits  On tv are  Awful  Really  Bravo  Wow  Yeah  Good for  Patton's dad  Yeah  They are  The other day  A guy called  In and said  I know what  Happened  They turned  The transponder's  Office  So this  Country  Some country  Shot it  Down  And they  Ran out  And when  They did  It  They gathered  Up all  The debris  And took  It in  So nobody  Will  Find  Oh  Jeez  That's  That's rough  A little hard  To do  Right  Sure is  Gathered a bunch  Of debris 
[02:35:30]  And no one  Sees it  Yeah  And that's  A guy with  A six figure  Salary  Every year  He was calling  From a house  Trailer  Even better  Okay  Well dad  Thanks  Thanks for  Getting on the radio  At least  Enjoy talking  To you guys  I'll see you  In a couple  Weeks  I'm looking  Forward to it  I love you dad  I love you dude  Bye  I wish my dad  Wasn't dead  Mine too  I would love to hear  My dad say  He loves me too  Oh my god  That would roll 
[02:36:00]  Hopefully you'll both  Get to see them soon  A couple weeks  I'll just put another  Rock on his tombstone  It's the same thing  Again every time  Something crazy happens  With aviation  I just call him  And he's like  No look  This is what's happening  It's not that big a deal  Relax  Calm the fuck down  They have to search  He's not convinced though  He's not convinced  That it's not taken though  He's still  But again  He's all about  Until let's chase  The facts down  Instead of just  You know  Going crazy  You know what could be  Some of the coolest footage 
[02:36:30]  I've ever seen  Is that Vietnam footage  Of the F-4s  Flying in slow motion  Dropping incendiary bombs  In the jungle  And you just see  The sparks  And fire  Coming up  Behind the F-4  It's like  God that is  The death and destruction part  You gotta kind of  Take out of it  For the moment  You just gotta look  And go  That is so fucking cool  Looking  There is  There is something  Really creepy  When you see stuff  Like that  I know exactly  The footage  I know the shot  And you go  You know the shot  I'm sorry  There's that disconnect 
[02:37:00]  Of that is absolute  Horror and death  And it looks gorgeous  It's amazing  So how do I process this  When you see something  That looks that amazing  And the CCR music  Of course  Of course  Of course  That son does help  Like we said earlier  Exactly  Yeah  You seem to be  You seem to be  Very different than your dad  Yeah  Well  Are you guys alike  In any way  I think we're alike  In that there's certain things  This is going to sound  Really broad in general 
[02:37:30]  But there are certain things  That we just cannot  Bring ourselves  To care about  So that there's  You know  But we never  Starvation  We never  No like  There's a lot of like  Social stuff  That people get wound up in  And my  You know my dad  Was always a certain way  About you know  Living in the suburbs  And I just  There's stuff  I just don't care about here  Like that people  Are getting all wound up  About like  Oh what's going to happen  To this neighbor  Is doing something weird  To this  He's like  I don't care 
[02:38:00]  I don't care  But then there was stuff  That I would get wound up  About growing up  That he's like  I don't know why  You get  I don't know why  You care about  That  I remember one time  Too that again  He had this  I got my ear pierced  Junior year of high school  And didn't tell them  I got my ear pierced  Because I'm dangerous  And a big Ed Bradley fan  Exactly  I'm dangerous  You better look out  And I sat down  At the kitchen table  And my dad's face  He had that  Here's what was weird about it  He had that look like 
[02:38:30]  Okay wait a second  I don't give a shit  About this  Because again  It's like  I've been through Vietnam  I've actually seen  But this is the closest  This kid's going to get  To doing something  Dangerous and cool  So now should I  Maybe react a little bit  And roll my eyes  So that he can feel it  Like he knew that  If I just go  I don't give a shit  I'm like  This is my rebellion  You need to react to this  Right right  So he did  But he was so not committed  To the  Oh so you got your ear  Like he was trying 
[02:39:00]  To be angry about it  He's like  I still can't  See right through it  He doesn't care  Yeah  So there was that  Kind of  You know  And then I got  Into that same problem  When I started doing  Stand up  There were certain things  That people  Told me that you're  Supposed to be focused on  And I'm like  Do I pretend to care about this  I don't care  Right  I have other stuff  I'm concerned with  So that's the one way  That we're  And we're also  I'm very  As I get older  And maybe he was more  Like me when he was young  But as I get older  I'm all about 
[02:39:30]  I want the fucking facts  Before I go forward  With anything  I don't care about  Being liberal  Or conservative  I want whatever  The facts are  And I will just  I will follow the facts  Give me the fucking facts  And the numbers  I don't want  Anecdotal evidence  I don't want  Yeah but I know one guy  That great  You just named  One fucking guy  Like that's how  I will go  I don't want pure emotion  Give me the guy  And the older I get  I'm just like  Give me the facts first  And then I'll decide 
[02:40:00]  And then I'll get excited  With that  We should get Alex Jones  On the phone  Are we trying to get him on today?  For real?  Oh I'm sure  We have mine once in a while  I'm sure he has a good  Has he ever burst into tears  While you're talking to him?  We goof on him a little bit  A little bit  We do goof on him  Yeah he's  His friendship with Jesse Ventura  Yeah  But even he has to know  Jesse is a boob  A bumbling boob  He has to know that  Yeah all those guys  If you don't think  The government knows 
[02:40:30]  Where that plane is  Really?  There's a guy named  James Adomian  Who does the best  Oh I've seen  Jesse Ventura  He does a video  On a  Did he ever do the video?  I don't know if he does a video  But he does  DeRosa showed us one  Wasn't it DeRosa?  But he literally is  But it's Jesse Ventura  Taken to his logical extreme  Right  Like just come in and say  Just say like good morning  Hey how you doing?  Good morning  How do you know  It's a good morning?  For all you know  Why would you assume 
[02:41:00]  Like everything  No way  And I'm not doing it  As good as it's dumb  But every single thing  Is questioned  How do you know?  Just because it's sunny  And pleasant  Maybe there's a  Alright fine  Fine  Well why do you know  It's fine?  Oh Jesus Christ  I was a Navy SEAL  Oh yeah  We weren't even  Talking about that  Yeah exactly  I don't know  What that has to do  With your  Yeah that's also  That great thing  When people bring up  Weird  They'll bring up 
[02:41:30]  Something where you're like  Well that's great  But that has nothing  To do with  What we're talking about  It's a weird thing  Into shaming you  Into not arguing  With him any further  Yeah yeah  Right yeah  It's like whenever  I'm punching somebody  In a wheelchair  They always have to  Mention it  Like hey  That whole thank you  For your service  Thing he did  To you  It's like you can't  Argue with him  About anything  Because he was  In the service  Did you ever see  These guys  They have a YouTube  They're called  Red State Update  And they play like  The most hardcore

[02:43:00]  Yeah  Or you can get trapped  In that world  You know  There has to be a balance  It's all about balance  Yes  So  What's the guy's name  That you're talking about  Oh  The Jesse  Sam  Could you look this guy up  Oh  James Adomian  That's amazing  Amazing  How many siblings you got  I got a little brother  Yeah  On  Who's  Does a  Did a thing called Puddin  Did a  Little series on YouTube  Called Puddin  With Eddie Pepitone  That was pretty funny  Just  You guys would love it

[02:57:30]  And he said you're smart  But he's Jake man  He's fucking  That motherfucker was  That life  And that abuse  And those fights  And that  That old school thinking  And he was  He was a professional  Before World War II broke out  Those hands  Were like  The thumbs  Were permanently back  From like  They were back  Further than normal thumbs  And the knuckles  Were  They were  They had been so  Broken and healed 
[02:58:00]  They were just like  These little metal  Knobs  Like it was just  They  They weren't even  Human anymore  They were just  This evolved  Just made to punch with  Exactly  Just punching machines  Yeah  I think his hands  Ake  I bet he can't feel them  I bet there's no feeling  Yeah  Apparently like  Phil Collins has no feeling  In his hands anymore  Because all the years  Of drumming  The nerve damage  He can't hold drumsticks anymore  Jeez  Fuck  Yeah there was  There's an interview with him  In Rolling Stone  That is one of the most depressing 
[02:58:30]  And I like Phil Collins  Yeah  I think he's great  But he has like  Reached this point  In his life  He's miserable  He literally talks about like  I guess it'd be okay  If I just died  Like what  What  Phil  How about you get a  Fucking prenup  Dumb Phil  Stop trusting everybody  He's been through what  Eleven divorces  With no prenup  Crazy  What a schmuck  We met him  Yeah we met him  And it was like  Just depressing  Where'd you meet him  Here  I got a picture with him  He came in here  To do the show  No no no  Oh no  We went into the green room  And I was very excited  Because I  There was a time 
[02:59:00]  I loved Genesis  Oh man  Yeah  I tried to tell him  Which I guess is  Kind of stupid anyway  I'm sure he's sick  Of hearing that  But he didn't want  Anything to do with us  He just wanted  The pictures done  And us out of there  I told you  You're the best singer  In Genesis  But when you did  Shock the monkey  You know  It really  Made him uncomfortable  Yeah  I'm sure he wouldn't  Like that  That affair with  Roseanne Arquette  You had  Wasn't amazing  Wasn't he a wanker  There was a guy  On hold for three hours  I was finally gonna go  To him  And he hung up  Hung up finally  He's saying that  The band bossy 
[02:59:30]  YouTube video  Has been taken down  Because of all  The ridiculous comments  Good  Bossy  I don't know  If that's true or not  I think the band bossy  Thing is gonna be a bust  Well I think it should  Have been banned  Just by us  No it's still up there  Right  I figured the guy  Was wrong  Because Beyonce  I figured I'd use it  Just to talk about it  People listen  She's delightful  Guys  Look I understand  That words hurt  And words have meaning  But you are just  Trying to find words  At this point  And make them  I wish somebody  Would do like  A fake campaign 
[03:00:00]  Just think of  Ban moist  Actually you know what  Ban moist  Every time I get naked  In front of a chick  The word moist  Is more offensive  And more creepy  Than bossy  Moist  Is more  Moist  Gross  Oh boy  Yeah  Moist  Moist  Moist  No  Moisture  Moist  Moist  Yeah moist  Ban moist  Ban moist  It's offensive  It's very mean  I tried it  But it didn't catch on  No  What word did I want to ban  I don't even remember  I tweeted out to ban 
[03:00:30]  Somewhere  I don't remember what it was  Sharing  Probably yeah  No more sharing  Enough of this stuff  I hate to bring up  Or ban  No I don't like to ban  Interface  Yeah  Interface on this  Yes unless you're talking  About coming  Oh for the love of God  I keep forgetting  Where I am  I keep forgetting  Locky  And cock  Got it  I hate to bring up  A douchey moment  From our careers 
[03:01:00]  But when we were in Boston  We decided to come up  With a word  Cunk  For girls  Oh  Well it was for the genitalia  Really  Right  And it was just  An excuse to  Almost say  Cunt  Yeah on our show  Cunk  And then remember  Oh it's douchey  I mean as you look back  Of course it's douchey  But at the time  It kind of took off  A little bit  With our dumb little fan base  And then remember  They came to us  And said we're not allowed  To say  Cunk on the air  Cunk  And I said  But it's a made up word 
[03:01:30]  We made that up  We made this up  We're not going to get fined  We know what it means  They were always worried  About the FCC  I'm like it's a word  That isn't in any dictionary  We know what you mean by it  Remember that  That's  Maybe they just thought  That they knew  The bit was douchey  And they were trying to help us  Move on  Yeah maybe that was it  That is kind of gorgeous  That you made up a word  And in real time  Got it banned  It was banned  That's how offensive it was  Yeah  That was a pretty good outcome  Hullabaloo 
[03:02:00]  That's a word we should get rid of  That's an uncomfortable word  That's what Hullabaloo  That's what Hullabaloo did to me  Well there's a  There's a British magazine  Called Viz  And in the back of every issue  They have a thing called  The Profanosaurus  And they make up  New curse words  To apply to different situations  And slang words  And it's gorgeous  Some of the things  They come up with  Like you know  New  God what was one of my favorites  Was  They keep coming up with new terms  For like really bad  Bowel movements  So they have stuff like  Meatloaf's Daughter 
[03:02:30]  And just like  Oh my god  And but  And but it's like  Pages and pages  Every month  Of this shit  They're just trying to think of  How do we not have to  How do we get by  Like fuck  Cunt shit  And stuff like that  And it's pretty amazing  Those are tough words  To forget though  Fuck cunt shit  Those are really  Those are  They work  Those are the standards  They work  They still work right  They're great words  Yeah  But the whole banning  I kind of like  Ban bossy in a way  Because it exposes  That mentality  That embarrassing mentality 
[03:03:00]  In the country  No one embraced this  But it's embarrassing  That we  That this is  Really being taken seriously  By some people  And  And Beyonce  Has songs  With the word  Bitch in it  Yeah  Which makes it  What a fake  I know  So hypocritical  And also  It's good to be  A bossy  You're in control  And people are looking  To you to get  It's not an insult  Someone goes  Hey you're kind of bossy  Thank you  Now get that shit done  Yeah  And by the way  Tina Fey  When she was  Stumping for 
[03:03:30]  Hillary Clinton  She's like  Everyone says  Hillary's a bitch  She is a bitch  And bitches get things done  And that's like  That's good  She reclaimed  That was awesome  No but that was like  Yes why are you  I remember I had a  There was this girl  I grew up with years ago  She's like  I don't know why girls  Treat the word cunt  Like the  Like a nuclear bomb  When I hear the word cunt  If someone says cunt  It means I'm winning the argument  And the guy is flailing  And desperate  And it makes me laugh  Like I just  I've never been offended  By the word cunt 
[03:04:00]  It just  To me  It is  That means you're losing  And you're free  You know  It starts a whole new argument  Is what it does  So yeah  You're probably losing  But some people  But what she's saying is  She goes  I don't know why women  Give that word the power  Whereas  What she said was  When a guy yells cunt  You should go  Oh that's  You poor guy  Really  It came down to cunt  You lose  So I guess we're done  Yeah  Yeah  Cunt was never an atom bomb  With girls I dated  There was always other things  Like yeah  Really  Nah it's just 
[03:04:30]  I mean  They're dating me  I'm a pig  I have a vulgar  That's true  Do you know what I mean  Like that's  That wasn't a big deal  To those women  But there's other stuff  That would have bothered them  Or whatever  Yeah yeah  Another girl's name  Yeah exactly  Want a Tim Conway dick story  Oh really  What  Okay sure  Kyle you're on the phone  That's quick  Oh wow  That Jim Norton  Is quick

[03:05:30]  I don't know if that's true  But I want it to be true  Of course  Of course  Especially if  I'm pretty sure  I really heard that  Especially if the guy  That approached him  Was like a  Carol Burnett show fan  Like it's a wonderful  Sunday night show  And the family  Oh Mr. Conway  And he just hears  Whips his dick out  And starts  Showing the vein highway  I'm gonna  Here's the thing  I don't think  That story's true  I really want it  To be true  Yeah  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  Repeat it  In the future  As true  Yeah yeah  Just make it

[03:07:00]  And he was really  And it was  At the point  It was like  It got so good  That he was like  What about this one  I'm like oh that  Okay  And then I got  And then I talked about  And I was laughing so hard  That I missed  What the band did  I talked about  There was a record store  Called Waxy Maxis  I used to work at  In Northern Virginia  Yeah Waxy Maxis  And I got fired  Because I mouthed off  To a customer  Because they were playing  The two other people  I worked with  Would play  It was all during the 80s  They were like playing  Mr. Mister  And I wanted to play  Like the Dead Kennedys  Frank and Christ  And so they 
[03:07:30]  And I just got fired  And then when they  Played me off  The band played  Mr. Mister's  Broken Wing  Oh shit  The Roots  Played Broken Wing  And I missed it  That's funny  Yeah they fucked with you  And I went over there  To thank them  Because they played me  On to this song  By The Coup  Called The Magic Clap  That I did a video for  There's this lyricist  Named Boots Riley  Who is the  Best lyricist  In hip hop  Period  And I  And I've been a fan  Of them  And they asked me  To do a video  So they 
[03:08:00]  The Roots  Found the video  And they played  The Magic Clap  When I came out  I was so happy  But I went over  To thank them  For The Magic Clap  I'm like did you just  We just played  Broken Wing  That's funny  I was laughing so hard  About what a douchebag  I was at this record store  Do you know how good  The Roots are  I did Fallon  A lot before  They had The Tonight Show  And they play  I didn't even know  They did it  We used to make fun  Of Van Halen  Doing a song called  We're Back  It was like a made up song  That I made up  Like Van Halen's new  Reunion song  Was gonna be  We're Back  And Better Than  It was awful 
[03:08:30]  And they played me on  To  We're Back  Isn't that amazing  What  They played that  They're like you didn't  Know  I was so fucking  I'm walking out  I'm just so worried  About bombing  The first time I did  The first time I did Fallon  They played  I do a bit about  When you listen to  The Chipmunks Christmas song  Slowed Down  And the Chipmunks  Sound like normal guys  And that guy  Sounds like a demon  Basically  And they did that  When I walked out  And I missed it  Cause like you  I was sort of like  I don't wanna do badly  You're walking out  Yeah I was actually  Telling a story  About losing my wallet  In a tranny bar  And so I was  Concentrating on  You know 
[03:09:00]  Not forgetting any of the facts  I wanna get every nuance  Of the story down  Right  Oh and  And thank god  You guys were harping  On that Eagles song  Get over it  Oh yeah  Get over it  Oh that fucking  And that was at the height  By the way  Of like the whole grunge thing  And it was like them coming  We're gonna come back  And show these  Here we go  These youngsters  Show them how  Show them how it's done  Was it something  That annoyed you?

If I could find your inner child  I'd kick his little ass  That's one of the lyrics  In the song  I swear to God  Oh god  We haven't played it that 
[03:10:00]  I thought pitching a fit was bad  Yeah we haven't played it that far yet  Yeah like Henley  We can only handle 30 seconds of that  That's an older man  Trying to sound like a young hip  Oh absolutely  Like I'll smoke up a reefer  You know  And I love Henley's voice  Always have  Well you know that  That documentary  The first half  It's a three hour documentary  It falls apart  Well no it doesn't fall apart  What happens is  The first half  The first 90 minutes  It's amazing  You are rooting for these guys  Like yeah  Good for them  And they're living underneath  Jackson Brown 
[03:10:30]  And they're learning how to write songs  And they're young scrappers  You're like way to go  And then at the exact halfway point  When the band breaks up  And they start their solo careers  You go  Oh these guys are huge douchebags  Now I see  I forgot that  I forgot  Yeah  What horrible  And I also love  Because you were doing the  You were watching the video  You were born in the city  Oh yeah  That's terrible  So when Glenn Fry's bragging  He's like yeah I did  The heat is on  And you were born in the city  And they pull in on the billboard chart
