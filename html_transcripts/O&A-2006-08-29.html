<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, calling themselves various vulgar names.  They launch into a discussion of John Carr, extradited from Thailand for allegedly killing JonBenét Ramsey, only to be exonerated due to a DNA mismatch.  The hosts mock Carr’s first-class flight at taxpayer expense and his outlandish statements.  The conversation then shifts to foie gras, its production, and the surrounding controversy.  They segue into promoting their upcoming Tweeter Center show in Philadelphia, offering $10 lawn seats and mentioning comedians like Bob Saget. Anthony recounts a childhood story about a friend, Richard, who propositioned him for a sexual act in a treehouse; Richard later died of pneumonia at 39.

The show incorporates listener calls, a ticket contest, and discussions of a nun hit by a Cadillac and a hit-and-run.  They promote PalTalk, showing themselves on camera even during breaks, and discuss viewer content. Clips from Russ Meyer's *Mondo Topless* are played, highlighting the film's campy nature and over-the-top narration. This *Mondo Topless* segment continues, with callers, including Chris from Illinois, expressing varying opinions.  Listener calls continue, with some praising, others criticizing the show.  Mike from Rochester initially expresses ambivalence but ultimately admits to enjoying the show, despite finding the Traveling Virus promotion dull. Steve from the Bronx mentions a rave video and past show segments. The hosts engage in extended jokes about a wedding between a couple with Down syndrome.  Mark from Deer Park criticizes Opie, sparking a heated exchange.

Studio guest Ralphie May joins the discussion about the tour and other topics. Damien Fahey from MTV is mentioned, with speculation about how his association with the show might impact his career.  They express excitement and nervousness about their upcoming appearance on *Late Night with David Letterman*. A discussion about a Conan O'Brien *Dateline* skit and its controversial airing near a real-life plane crash is included.  The show's vulgar and sexually explicit tone persists.

With Damien Fahey and Ralphie May still in studio, the focus shifts to preparing for the Letterman appearance, including strategizing for a successful performance and speculating on Letterman's personality.  Tangents include a listener call about purchasing photos of underage Miss Teen contestants, Damien Fahey's upcoming MTV Video Music Awards hosting gig (including jokes about Jessica Alba and Beyoncé and a story about a previous unpleasant encounter with Master P's sweaty armpit), another mention of the Down syndrome wedding (including an audio clip), further promotion of the Traveling Virus show (including a Ticketmaster contest), a lengthy discussion about CBS's censorship policies regarding language, numerous listener calls with sexually explicit anecdotes,  a discussion about a dwarf suing a prison for injuries sustained from falling off a sink while shaving, and promotion of their own appearances and projects.

A significant portion of the show is dedicated to listener calls detailing childhood masturbation experiences, using various objects and lubricants.  Female callers share their experiences as well.  The hosts and callers discuss the difficulties of finding privacy as children and getting caught. Ralphie May shares a story about accidentally watching *Iron Eagle 3*. Ryan Starr, a *Rock Star: Supernova* finalist, calls in, discussing his Long Island upbringing, early band experiences, and the show's drama.

A post-interview segment with Ryan Starr follows, featuring an acoustic performance of "Losing My Religion."  Discussion turns to Brooke Burke's co-hosting performance, Opie's graphic commentary on her personality, and Dave Navarro's role.  They discuss listener feedback, a recently filmed TV commercial, and censorship issues.  "Billy Dee from Pittsburgh" criticizes a previous interview, leading to another heated exchange.  They discuss upcoming appearances (including Letterman), joke about outfits, briefly cover a hostage situation, and engage in more vulgar banter and listener call-ins.  The show ends with more listener feedback, insults, and a crude outro.  Throughout the entirety of the broadcast, the language is consistently vulgar, sexually explicit, and offensive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  In the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[00:01:30]  And I, whenever this song comes on the radio, I always feel like I gotta go to work.  We never get to the song part, though.  No.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  It certainly is. 
[00:02:00]  Very nicely.  Yeah, we like the list.  Haven't looked at the list in a while.  See this thing?  Yeah, it's growing.  Yeah, I looked at it.  He's like, wow.  Gotta start a second page.  All of our filigots.  I love saying the filigots.  Who do we say hi to this morning?  Hmm.  Let's see.  Hmm.  Well, Vegas was yesterday because it was our first day on in Vegas. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And again, welcome our good friends in Las Vegas.  Actually, Jimmy, who do you want to say hi to this morning?  Oh, I don't know.  There's so many lovely options.  New London, Connecticut is not a good option.  Hey, it certainly is.  The Wolf.  I would say no.  We like the Wolf.  The Wolf.  Grr.  Yeah, it's a little too frightening for me.  Grr.  What about we could always say hi to Cleveland because we're coming there? 
[00:03:00]  No, no.  Yeah, you're right.  It's too early.  Stupid accents.  I'd rather say hi to Philly before I say hi to Cleveland.  How about Baton Rouge, Louisiana?  Nah, the whole Katrina thing just turned me off.  Yeah, the year anniversary since Louisiana was struck by it.  And Baton Rouge is close enough, so we don't want to think about Katrina today.  No.  Thanks for the one-year anniversary, by the way.  And the news wants a hurricane so bad.  So badly.  Oh, do they want it.  They're reporting it like, look out.  Will it strengthen? 
[00:03:30]  We're headed to Florida.  How about Philly?  Yeah.  Do we have the...  Yeah.  Do we have the Twitter center?  I would say Philly.  Yeah, you want to do that?  Good morning to everybody listening to us on WYSP.  In Philly.  Start honking those horns, baby.  That's right.  Beep and wave out the window.  In a friendly show.  Friendly fashion.  Whatever it is, idiots do when they like a radio show.  Yeah.  Honk your horns and see how many people aren't listening to this radio show right now. 
[00:04:00]  Gank.  Gank.  Right.  Start waving at somebody.  It's your own reflection in a storefront.  We're going to take over, Philly, in I think 10 days.  The WYSP website, they got a countdown.  Oh, nice.  They got the countdown when we're going to be hitting town with the O&A traveling virus,  the O&A circus.  They're good eggs.  And, yeah, Jimmy, what's the deal with the lawn seats?  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things.  Well, starting today, same thing we did in New York and Jersey here. 
[00:04:30]  Starting at the Twitter Center is offering special $10 lawn seats that are going to run  now through Labor Day.  Going on sale at 9 o'clock this morning through Labor Day at 5.  I don't know why we have a 5 p.m. listing.  Like, we're going to wait until 4.50.  Just drink yourself to death in a room alone if you wait that long.  Today at 9 o'clock, $10 lawn seats.  We got 10 comics on the show and 9 comics on the show.  Yeah.  Including Saget and Don Marrera and Jimmy Schubert.  You know, just go to the show. 
[00:05:00]  And all the fan sites are talking about making the trip to the Twitter Center in the Philly  area, and they're trying to figure out where to tailgate and all that.  So it's going to be exciting.  It's going to be another circus for everybody.  Another good one.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  So we say hi to Philly today.  Yes.  And what a dope right there on the front page.  Right on the front page of all the newspapers today.  I'm sure all the papers around the country.  John Carr, yes. 
[00:05:30]  We said it.  We said it as soon as this story hit.  Yeah.  That this guy was innocent.  Too many loose ends.  I knew he was innocent because I did it.  Jimmy.  Jimmy wants to get to Colorado.  He needs a flight in first class in Champaign.  I don't have enough miles on Continental.  I'm going to say I did it.  Those jackasses.  They'll fly you anywhere.  Do you like a private plane, sir?  This guy, this John Carr, he's in Thailand.  He's up on some kind of kiddie charges.  Teacher over there. 
[00:06:00]  Maybe some inappropriate touching going on.  And he's up on charges.  So he blurts out, I killed John Bonnet Ramsey.  I got this info.  And the police are saying, well, he's got a lot of information.  This guy.  Let's take him back.  Look, this is the guy.  So they fly him back on, you know, the taxpayer's dime back to a boulder.  First class.  Yeah, they fed him.  The guy flies.  They fed him well, too.  They cleared out the whole first class section. 
[00:06:30]  So everyone else has to sit and coach.  It's him and the cops.  What they probably did on a flight was they reserved it and probably had made the government buy every ticket in first class.  Every ticket in first class.  They show him talking with the cops, smiling, laughing, drinking champagne on this flight over from Thailand.  I think he had some of that pate, too.  A little pate.  Was he some foie gras?  Foie gras.  Did he have some foie gras?  What's the stuff you squeeze through the goose liver? 
[00:07:00]  That's foie gras.  It is foie gras.  There's a whole big thing in the paper today about that, too.  A lot of states are now banning it because they have to stuff the food down the bird's throat.  They force feed them to make their livers huge.  Yeah.  Like they deform their livers.  And that's how they get so much foie gras per goose.  What is foie gras?  It's goose liver.  Ew.  Yeah.  Who eats that crap?  No.  Opie?  I had it once. 
[00:07:30]  You in that tax bracket yet?  It's the law.  You have to.  I think I had it once with Brother Wee's when I'm up in Rochester.  I think we had some foie gras.  Foie gras.  Foie gras.  Don't they squeeze?  Foie gras.  Ew.  Ribbit.  I think.  Foie gras.  I think they squeeze the actual liver.  And whatever comes out, that's the foie gras.  I don't know.  Foie.  Foie.  I don't need to pronounce it right.  No.  How do you say it?  Is it foie gras?  Foie gras.  I've never heard of it.  Foie gras.  It's some French word, I think.  Anyway. 
[00:08:00]  Well.  French word.  It's safe to say that John Carr was eating quite well.  Yeah.  Eating well.  Coming over.  And then they do the DNA test.  This is what everyone's waiting for because they had gotten some DNA off of Lil JonBenet  when they found her in the basement.  Her little panties.  Ten years ago.  I was reading that today.  Yeah.  Pretty sick.  Sick F.  So they try to match up the DNA.  Meh.  No match.  You're free to go.  You're free to go to California to answer to some kiddie porn picture charges from 2001, 
[00:08:30]  which is going to amount to some kind of misdemeanor.  The guy's going to wind up getting off the hook for everything.  And this was their big ten years later, Boulder looks like asses again.  Ten years.  Remember ten years ago?  They were like, everyone was saying, well, how could you not solve this case?  You got a case of a little girl.  She's dead in a house.  It's Christmas Eve. 
[00:09:00]  There's only so many people that had access.  This is one of those crimes where it's, you know, not just somebody stepping in and do this.  It had to be somebody that knew the girl.  And they were like, duh, we can't handle this stuff.  Ten years later, they swoop in going, well, it took time, but we got him now.  They're all confident.  They're all confident.  Look, we're flying him back.  We're going to fly him back first class.  Let's do the perp walk with his pants pulled up to his nipples.  This is great.  Look how creepy this guy is.  He had to be the guy that did it.  And I both did the same hack joke in the office as we were preparing for today's show. 
[00:09:30]  But we both had to make sure that we didn't mean it.  But we were like, lest the guys think we actually did it as a real joke.  Right, right, right, right.  So Opie comes out with the joke, and I went like, you're late by about 20 minutes.  I did that hack joke, the exact same one.  We both said to the staff here that he should have been arrested by the fashion police.  By the fashion police.  Ha, ha, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.  So I do it.  I get the courteous chuckle from the staff that doesn't want to be fired. 
[00:10:00]  And then Opie comes in and says the same joke.  And they laugh again.  It's like the Caligula laugh.  When he would look around and raise his fingers, and they would laugh.  But then we both had to make sure that we didn't mean it as a real joke.  We were doing like a Pat from Wynaki hack joke type of thing.  Of course.  It's the hacky joke they would use in the paper.  Well, here's the news story to make it official.  It was a strange 15 minutes of thing.  Was it?  A creepy teacher in Thailand apparently fessing up in a sensational case, the murder of six-year-old John Benet Ramsey. 
[00:10:30]  But now John Carr is off the hook, whether he likes it or not.  We're deeply distressed by the fact that they took this man and dragged him here from Bangkok, Thailand, with no forensic evidence confirming the allegations against him.  But it was Carr himself who sent emails saying he accidentally asphyxiated John Benet while having sex with her and claimed he even drank her blood.  A simple DNA swab proved Carr's story a fraud, along with strong circumstantial evidence. 
[00:11:00]  We've been hearing so many reports that he had an airtight alibi from relatives.  He'd been not even in the state.  Yeah, he wasn't flagged there.  Not even in the state.  Yeah, he bamboozled everybody to get out of Bangkok.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, Bangkok.  Some of the things he was saying are the quotes. 
[00:11:30]  He gets some of these quotes.  But how could the guy not be arrested just for being a creep?  There should be a law on the books.  Creep.  Yeah.  He is a creep.  Are you asking me why I killed John Benet?  I don't see it that way.  No one's asking.  Her and I...  Oh, I was just saying this.  Yeah, it's just me.  Her and I were engaged in a romantic and very sexual interaction.  It went bad and it was my fault.  That's what he said.  At least he took responsibility, though.  For something he didn't do, of course.  If it was ever revealed that John Benet died by my hands, I would be one of the most wanted killers in history. 
[00:12:00]  Sounds like something you wanted.  I will say this.  The asphyxia apparatus found around her neck was not the one used during our lovemaking, he says.  I am very sentimental.  I wanted to keep the first object of asphyxia, so I removed it to take with me.  I then placed the second object, the killer, which was the one left with her. 
[00:12:30]  So the thing, you know, the Garrett twisted around her throat was just a stunt Garrett.  He took the original one because he's sentimental.  What a guy.  He's a real charmer.  He says, I have charisma with little girls.  They instantly bond with me.  Ugh.  Well, you know, you've got to give the guy credit.  He's got this life, fun attitude.  Yeah, he does.  He's a bon vivant.  He's charming and silly.  I loved her so much, and I am sorry that she died in my arms.  If anyone came close to screaming, it was I.  Please don't leave me. 
[00:13:00]  I love you so much.  Oh, baby doll, please come back to me.  That's what everyone screams on Pal Talk.  It sounds like what Kenny said whenever Ope goes away.  I was just hugging him.  I love you so much.  Oh, baby doll, please come back to me.  I have your cereal.  Oh, someone should be arrested on that creep law.  It's him.  Hey, Rusty from South Beach. 
[00:13:30]  There should be a law against using Beavis and Butthead references and imitations in the year 2006.  I know, but when you say Bangkok, what else are you going to do?  Yeah, you've got to go there.  Sorry.  And then Bill from Waterford.  I'm glad John Carr is innocent so he can continue his comedy tour with Bob Kelly.  Here's more to the story.  Former prosecutor Angelo McDonald says Boulder DA Mary Lucy had to arrest Carr in case he might flee.  And authorities say he was already involved with one of his Thai students. 
[00:14:00]  As a DA, you've got to be very careful because, you know, if you get evidence that may lead to a crime,  you have a duty and a responsibility to investigate.  Now the 41-year-old Carr will face child pornography charges that date back to a 2001 case in California he had skipped out on.  Ooh, they got him.  San Diego County has given us a teletype and does want to extradite him.  Dick Brennan, Fox 5 News.  The Ramsey family says it still supports the Boulder District Attorney. 
[00:14:30]  And in the meantime, after 10 years, the person who murdered JonBenet Ramsey continues to elude justice.  Well, I think that Jon Ramsey, the father, actually did come out in the media and say,  we knew it wasn't him because I'm the only one that knew what my bonus was for the note.  Stupid.  That was his quote.  By the way, Daily News, good job.  When this first broke last week or whatever it was, or 10 days ago before vacation,  the Daily News was solved.  That was the headline of the Daily News.  Solved.  Solved.  Wow. 
[00:15:00]  Got him.  Solved.  Did ya?  Exclamation point.  Solved.  Oh, good boy.  Jump the gun, New York.  Wait, we actually have it?  There it is.  From what day?  That's the Daily News, yeah.  That was from, I can't, that was, I wish we had a better way of photocopying, but I don't know.  Cut the date off, did it?  Solved.  Whatever, yeah, a couple weeks ago when it, uh.  Big exclamation point, though, at the end, so how would that actually read?  Solved!  And they used this picture of her, which I don't like, she looks fat.  Yeah, I like the one with the little cowboy hat. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, traipsing around.  Right, little boots.  Her six-shooters.  Pew, pew, pew, pew.  So, there you go, there's the top story for today.  Unbelievable.  Uh, why don't we take our first break?  We're just warming up, it's the Opie and Anthony show, we'll get into other things today.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Ralphie Mae's stopping by, Damian Fahey's stopping by, our pal from MTV.  I have an update on, remember the story I told about the tree house in California? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  With, uh, Richard, the, ah.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  You know you're gonna have to retell the story.  Yeah, yeah, I'll retell it briefly.  And you know I'm gonna have to sit here and make believe I'm hearing it for the first time.  Make believe you heard it for the first time.  And the listeners, you know, you know, you can play along and make believe you're hearing it for the first time as well.  We all need the men in black little light thing.  Just a, foonk, into each other's faces so we can tell the same stories over and over.  We finally tore down that wall recently.  Remember we finally invented it?  Yeah.  You told some story and I made believe I'm hearing it for the first time. 
[00:16:30]  Like, I can't, I can't play this gig anymore.  Oh, and we sit here and I just go, you had a dog named Fresca?  Really, Opie?  Margarine and sugar sandwiches?  That doesn't sound healthy.  Tell me more.  Although lately we have been telling new stories.  Yes.  But there's an update, so I'll have to tell this one again.  Briefly, I'll give it the abridged first.  My turtle story yesterday was wonderful.  My big turtle story.  Brand new turtle story.  It went into a whole big thing about turtles.  All right.  Why don't we take a break? 
[00:17:00]  We'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across...  Where?  Philadelphia.  Yeah.  Oh.  Trove.  Soup.  Tears.  Poodle.  Robert Reed.  And repeat.  And repeat.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[00:17:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow.  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Good morning to everybody.  Good morning to everyone on Pal Talk.  It's getting light out.  Wow.  Sunrise is 6.20 this morning.  A lot of people going portable with their computers these days. 
[00:18:00]  They just get online no matter where they are.  You get to see people during their commute, in their cars, in their trucks.  Big rigs.  They're popping the cameras right up on their dashboard.  And you're watching them where they're driving.  Someone's bitching to us on Instant Feedback because the Pal Talk's not free.  We have nothing to gain from Pal Talk.  No, we don't make money off that.  It's this technology that stumbled, I don't know, and stumbled across.  You know the website people were on it. 
[00:18:30]  So I kind of found out about it that way and decided it would be cool to put cameras in the studio so you could just pop in and watch what we do when we're taking commercial breaks.  During the show, if something's going on that we want you to see, a little visual, we'll pop the cameras on that.  It's just fun.  And at the same time, we can watch the listeners.  They put the cameras on themselves.  Some of them very attractive women that flash, show various parts of themselves.  They've been shower cams where we watch the girls actually showering as we try to do a program. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Dancing to this kind of music.  An old 80s strip club.  And then the radio show ends and they continue in these rooms all day long.  It's like the ONA experience just continuing on.  But it costs money.  But we're not getting anything from it.  And you can watch for free.  It's like the old stinky cam at any W.  But it's like it's all going to refresh once every, what, you know, however.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  I don't think it's quite that bad. 
[00:19:30]  But it's relatively speaking, too.  I think it amounts to something like.  Five bucks a month.  Is it five a month?  Best package, which means that you can get like really good, clear, crisp live video.  It's like 60 bucks a year.  If you can't afford.  Look, I understand that money is relative.  Times is tough.  If you don't have 60 bucks for the year of looking at what's going on with it.  Look at the view you're getting right now of my chin and my Breathe Right strip.  If that's not worth it.  It's a wonderful shot.  And we're having a big contest, by the way.  Yeah? 
[00:20:00]  Yes.  We're doing the 47th caller receives one out of two free tickets for the lawn seats for the Camden Tweeter Center virus tour.  What?  They're going on sale at 9 o'clock.  We're anticipating they're going to be sold out by 910.  So if you call in between now and 637, if you're the 47th caller, you receive one out of two free lawn tickets.  One out of two.  And a pair of John Carr's DNA free underpants for our Tweeter Center show. 
[00:20:30]  Well, that's pretty exciting, actually.  $10 lawn seats going on sale this morning for the Camden, New Jersey show down there in Philly.  Yes.  And they're going to do that all the way through Labor Day, I guess.  Labor Day.  Until 5 p.m. Labor Day, by the way.  The rumor was that it was going to go until 6.30 p.m. on Labor Day, which is when most people would get together and buy tickets.  But they said, no, no, no, we have to put our foot down and end at 5 p.m.  At 5, exactly.  I was sticking to my day, that decision.  Make sure you put 5 so nobody calls me late.  I'm going home early that day.  Who are you?  It was Frank the Frowner. 
[00:21:00]  Frank the Frowner.  That was very good.  There is no God.  We like these stories.  Well, I mean, we don't like them like them, but it just shows you, is there really a God?  Is there?  Is there?  Is there?  The headline, none clipped by Cadillac.  In critical condition.  Jimmy, where were you?  Oh, not my caddy.  Not where it was said, none clipped by Caddy.  Giggling fellow pulled over.  No, the driver was 68, and he did the right thing. 
[00:21:30]  He stopped.  Because a lot of times in New York, when there's a hit.  Oh, they run.  There's the run.  You know why?  They don't hit and stay in the New York area.  Because a lot of people that hit and run in New York have no insurance.  Maybe had just stolen the car.  Or they're drunk.  Or they're drunk, yeah.  That's another one.  There was a horrific one that happened over the weekend.  It was a couple.  And the guy hit, I think, the dude so hard.  And the couple was holding hands as they're crossing the street. 
[00:22:00]  Ripped their hands apart.  The guy went flying dead.  And the car just keeps going.  Just keeps going.  Yeah, the old hit and run.  But you got to question if there's a God.  And please don't take this seriously.  Because then you get all the religious freaks.  We're just freaking trying to make you laugh a little bit.  Relax.  What do they say, Opie?  They try to type that out.  But they're in too much of a fervor.  So they just go.  There's a lot of E's and G's and E-O-G-H's.  It's kind of an H.  Right, an H. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, you know.  But I mean, I see these stories.  And I really question my faith.  Question if there's maybe a better religion out there.  I don't know.  Yeah.  When you get a headline like this, nun clipped by Cadillac in critical condition, a beloved.  Not only is she a nun, she's a beloved nun.  Are there hated nuns?  Like, aren't all nuns beloved?  I guess if you go to Catholic school and the old ones that whapped your fingers, your knuckles with the ruler back in 1903. 
[00:23:00]  What the hell am I talking about?  You never hear about a wildly ignored nun.  Right.  A surly nun.  She was surly.  A surly nun.  I just want to know, what was her crime against humanity that she had to take this on yesterday?  What awful thing did this nun do that God figured, you know something?  I know you're a nun, but you got to go.  She gives up all worldly possessions for God, and she's clipped by a luxury vehicle. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, that's even worse.  Hence, you got a question.  A caddy hits her.  Your faith from time to time.  I'll take my vow of poverty.  So this rich guy can hit me.  Right.  No sex for me.  No possessions for me.  86 years old?  Yeah.  86 years young, Anthony.  She never considered herself old.  Well, at 86, you have bones like graham crackers.  So when a caddy hits you, you're probably busting up a few things. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, what they're not telling you is this car was parked, actually, at the time.  What?  Just bumped into it and fell out of her shoes.  Old pretzel stick femur.  Well, that's the other observation.  I don't get it.  When you're hit by a car, you lose a shoe every time.  My shoes fell off.  Like, they have this horrific picture in the, what paper is this?  They're all the same to me.  Was it the Daily News?  It was close.  Does it matter?  Yeah, the news people get down there quickly enough to catch that photo of the lone shoe 
[00:24:30]  sitting on the street.  And then someone driving by with their mouth agape, like, oh my God, what happened here?  What happened?  But there's her one shoe just sitting there in the crosswalk.  Is it an F me pump?  It's a very nunly shoe.  Yeah, it's a white one.  All right.  All right.  So this was her crime against humanity, I guess.  A beloved nun who served senior citizens was fighting for her life yesterday after being  struck by a Cadillac, just steps from her Hell's Kitchen apartment. 
[00:25:00]  She's 86 years old.  She's a strong, wonderful lady who's very concerned about the client she served.  Basically, Sister Margaret Coakley, 86, was walking east on West 52nd Street about 1.20  p.m. when she was hit by a car, turning left onto 10th Avenue, cops and witnesses said.  She's a strong, wonderful lady who's very concerned about the client she serves, said  Peggy Blah Blah, who helps run a senior citizens program.  She works with our seniors to provide... 
[00:25:30]  Remember the Greenwich Blah Blahs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I know that family.  She works with our seniors to provide escorts for them.  What?  Wait a minute.  She's pimping?  Sister Craigslist.  She works with our seniors to provide escorts for them.  Escorts.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would think, you know, to help them walk around.  Obviously.  And then do chores with them.  No action.  And get them to the grocery store.  She probably worked with people that were younger than her. 
[00:26:00]  Everyone.  Yeah.  I would say so.  Senior center.  How great would it be if a nun was actually getting real escorts for the elderly?  Because that's what the elderly, especially the guys, really want.  Oh, of course they do.  They don't want someone helping them across the street or helping them at the grocery store.  They want an escort to help them out.  Not the healthy ones.  If you're at the home, though, you're, you know, we've talked about that one.  Where a guy just sits there going, help, help.  I had to do a job once when I was actually working for a living. 
[00:26:30]  Doing sheet metal work in an old folks home.  And a guy was just sitting in a wheelchair yelling, screaming, help, at the top of his lungs.  And people would just walk by and go, Mr. Johnson, could you please be quiet?  Help!  Help!  And you think, why is anyone helping this guy?  And they must, he must just do that all day.  He's the big Beatles fan.  Is that what he was doing?  They finally put it on and he shuts up.  Yeah, you should go back the next day when he was yelling yesterday.  I want to hold your hand! 
[00:27:00]  Okay.  Yelling all of Voss's walk-on songs.  Paperback rider!  Wow.  So there you go.  It's a very tragic story.  There is no God.  In New York here.  All right.  My name's Fred.  I'm a man just like you.  So why don't we get the Richard update, Anthony?  Ah, yes.  For the new listeners, I've heard this story 20 times.  20 times.  Who's Richard? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, who is this Richard guy?  Richard.  Yeah.  Just Richard.  I don't want to say his last name or nothing.  Probably got family out there somewhere.  I want to just show everybody my acting chops.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I went out to California for vacation last week.  Yep.  Had a great time.  Yep.  Stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  Hotel California.  You know?  Why?  Why?  Because I just wanted to be at a really cool hotel.  But you don't leave your hotel when you're on vacation. 
[00:28:00]  That's just it.  It's cool.  They got a great pool there.  Nice food.  They got the polo lounge.  They got a great room service.  You don't even want to leave the room.  It's great.  And then it was close enough to certain places that I wanted to go.  Me and the girl, he went to Universal Studios to laugh at the tour.  Because remember when we used to talk about how our old producer, Rick Delgado, was a tour guide on the Universal Studios tour. 
[00:28:30]  So we just laughed at everything the person said, especially when he went and said,  Now, the front of these might look like a real house.  You're not using your bullhorn.  Yes, I am.  Look at me.  Ladies and gentlemen, the front of these houses, you might recognize this one from Leave It to Beaver.  But as we drive around the front, it looks like a normal house you might see in your own neighborhood.  But here we go around the side of the house to the back.  You'll notice it is only a front of the house.  This is called a facade, which means false front. 
[00:29:00]  Every time you get that goddamn facade story, your whole story is a facade.  Is that the same tour with Jaws coming out of the water?  As we make the turn, it's beautiful Amity.  Here we are in Amity.  You can see the people just milling about.  By the way.  Lake in the middle.  Oh, no.  A fisherman seems to be having trouble there in the middle.  By the way, I took that tour.  And at that point, I realized what a ripoff. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, totally.  It doesn't look like Amity.  Doesn't look like Amity.  Doesn't look like the shark.  Doesn't look like nothing.  And that poor tour guide has to, like, try to, you know, suck you in.  And then he says something funny.  He says something funny like, hey, there's something you don't see every day.  But I do.  As we continue.  Oh, look out.  It's an earthquake.  Is it?  Is it really?  Why am I saying that?  Is it?  Is it really?  So we did that, which is funny. 
[00:30:00]  They have a haunted house.  Van Helsing haunted house.  Now, you know me.  I'm a scaredy cat.  Whenever you go through, it's a walk through, like, maze type thing with the real people that come out of nowhere and scare you.  And we're laughing like idiots at how scared we're getting at this attraction.  Just walking through.  Because there'll be, like, people dressed in these horrible costumes.  And they come out of curtains. 
[00:30:30]  And you can't see anything, really.  It's just barely lit.  And then to have somebody, you just walk right into it.  And somebody's standing two inches away from you going, oh, does it scare the bejesus out of you?  Remember the time we went to Spooky World up there in Massachusetts?  Spooky World!  And they had a pretty cool haunted house that was really scary.  Yeah.  But the asses that were the scary people in the haunted house, like, in the middle of the tour, they're like, boo, I'm a big fan.  Yeah, they ruined it.  I'm like, stop ruining it for me, man. 
[00:31:00]  I want to be scared.  It's Halloween.  Like, the first year we went, we had a blast because it was really scary.  They come at you with chainsaws and stuff.  Then the chicks are screaming and everything.  And it's really fun.  And then as we kind of got popular in Massachusetts, yeah, the people that put on the thing would be like, hey, man, love the show.  Like, dude, as they're running up to us with chainsaws.  Yeah, chainsaws and Jason masks.  They're great.  It's like, dude, could you sign this?  All right, Jason. 
[00:31:30]  Thanks.  Thanks, Jason.  Could you scare me a little bit?  Right.  You ass ruining the whole experience.  Had a good time.  Went there.  And then we decided I was going to go visit San Juan Capistrano.  The old neighborhood.  The old stomping ground.  How far from L.A. is that?  It's about an hour drive south.  San Juan Capistrano.  It's where Ant's Pop live.  Yeah, my dad used to live there.  I took a look at, you know, the lay of the land. 
[00:32:00]  Saw that.  Changed a lot.  Built a lot.  Big population now.  But still, you know, basically the same.  Ended up at the Swallows Inn.  It's that bar that's in because the Swallows come back to Capistrano every year on March 19th.  I remember that.  Don't ask me what my old wedding anniversary was.  But I remember that.  Ended up at the Swallows Inn, which you can see in the movie Heartbreak Ridge.  And had a few beers there.  But then I found out, finally, after all these years, what happened to Richard. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, but you got to tell the Richard story.  Well, when I was living there, I guess I was about 14 years old at the time.  We had a tree house at the stable.  We used to have horses, stuff very equestrian.  Family had a stable and built a tree house.  Big tree fort.  And occasionally, nice nights, we'd hang out at the ranch, drink a few beers and stay in the tree house. 
[00:33:00]  It was great.  You know, things to do as you're a kid.  Well, there's one evening in particular up in the tree house.  I'd been out.  It was probably, you know, drinking beers and stuff.  And it was probably, I don't know, one in the morning, something like that.  And I'm just kind of laying there, ready to go to sleep.  And Richard kind of comes over and, where's my, here it is. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  Kind of comes over and leans his head in by mine and goes, oh, wait, this is a, that's new to the story.  The lean your head in part.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, you had to get close because it was a whisper.  Well, there's only two of you.  Yeah, but he was, you know.  I've heard the story many times, but you never said that he leaned his head in.  Well, he leaned his head in a little closer.  Because I noticed he was a little closer than he was before.  Did you feel the warmness of his breath?  No, I didn't.  Did you have to bag it? 
[00:34:00]  I did not.  After your neck hair.  Didn't feel it?  Little 14-year-old whiskers?  No.  Scraping up?  Didn't feel it.  Scraping up against your neck?  Not a thing.  Just sensitive.  Hey, man, Jimmy picked up on it, too.  You never said he leaned his head in.  It was leaning over because I kind of, like, felt that he was closer.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  So he leaned in a little closer.  That's all.  Because I was now facing.  I'm laying down facing the wall of the treehouse. 
[00:34:30]  And he's on the other side of the treehouse.  Yeah.  So he leans in a little closer and says, do you want me to give you a b**** job?  Because if you want me to, I'll b**** your b****.  Just a whisper. 
[00:35:00]  Just barely a whisper.  Yeah, barely.  I'll b**** your b****.  And now I'm laying there.  I am awake, but I don't dare move.  I'm staring at the wooden side of the treehouse.  And I just start going, was Jackson Brown playing?  No music was playing.  She's got to be somebody.  That wasn't the Jennifer Jason Leigh music. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, she's getting pounded in the dugout.  Oh, f*** your b****.  It's okay.  Wait, you were staring at a knot?  No, I wasn't staring at a knot.  Richard was.  No, I was covered by a sleeping bag.  And I was looking at the wood, the side of the treehouse. 
[00:36:00]  Okay.  I wasn't facing him.  So, I just made believe I was asleep.  I just laid.  And I just.  You want to b****.  Oh, f*** your b****.  Had to now make believe I was asleep as my eyes were just agape in horror that this had happened. 
[00:36:30]  Now, we'd been friends for years.  Right.  Friends for years.  Used to go fishing.  You had no clue, right?  Not a clue.  And the girls would swarm over this guy.  Swarm over him.  It was ridiculous.  And not a clue.  Until you want a b****. 
[00:37:00]  Did he get louder?  Trying to wake you up?  Can I b**** your b***, please?  I need b****.  in my on my yeah it was uh it was a quite uh harrowing an experience but uh that was that 
[00:37:30]  was pretty much it i guess i guess he he got the message or you know realized i wasn't  prone to that direction so i was asleep so what'd you do in the morning that was very awkward now  in the morning because i didn't know like how to handle it so i just assumed uh so you stayed in  the treehouse for the whole night uh yeah it was like i i just stay there like oh what would you  what was that supposed to do leave how do you leave i gotta go faggot no because then if i was awake i'd 
[00:38:00]  have to confront the situation how about 20 minutes ago oh man i just woke up my back hurts queer i gotta  leave i couldn't do that not you the perpetual victim just stay there looking delicious you  understand he looked at you did you hear that heavy breathing behind you as he stared at the back of  your neck i think i did when you left in the morning were you wondering geez how did i spill tapioca all  over myself i didn't there was no tapioca anywhere i i i didn't know what to do if i should 
[00:38:30]  like leave there wouldn't have been a way to leave without having to confront the situation  yeah so i figured you know we're all with you unless unless i i you know heard a a a belt start uh  coming undone like broke back mountain uh it was just i figured i would just i understand i'm just  let let's see how this plays out see if he just i understand i'm sure the tree house was so far in 
[00:39:00]  the woods it was dark you were scared to walk home alone i get it no the tree house is very it was  like right next to the road sure was it right next to your house no it was next to the stable it was  about uh two miles from the house but but no i know if i woke up i'd have to say hey what are you  doing how old were you when this happened uh 14 oh that's old enough to confront it it's like you  were seven you know no no i mean i didn't like you see see we were friends for for a couple of years 
[00:39:30]  already yeah so i didn't know how or want to confront this situation you get you you gotta like  look that's embarrassing but the time when you offered me i was like no  and that didn't affect our working relationship or anything you think steve was gonna pop it  once in a while i really would like no no i don't get out of here for you didn't but you're never  asleep see if you maybe you were asleep you would just i didn't know how to confront it i you know it 
[00:40:00]  was one of those surprise did you end up surprise your best friend is gay did you end up falling  asleep for real uh no no i was and and uh the second like the sun came up that was it i was like  whoa look it's morning time to go but then i just figured all right did he sleep it was the i assumed  he stopped stopped asking me if he will my so i assumed but uh it was one of those situations 
[00:40:30]  where where i figured you know he had to take care of that urge right yeah what do you mean so he was  doing something very quietly while you were making believe you were sleeping right the object of his  lust was right there he could smell your skin the back of your neck your boyish sweat on your shirt  collar who wouldn't be tempted you make me sound hot then you feel the treehouse just like shaking  slightly uh no it was a big eucalyptus tree with just this noise every once in a while 
[00:41:00]  no shut up you went home your dad said hey how'd you get sap in your hair  no as you're like fake snoring all you hear in the background is a  no i don't recall hearing anything i believe i had pulled the sleeping bag you're not naive you're a  very smart person you know he had to take care of that urge no matter what wasn't thinking about 
[00:41:30]  that so he he got the job done probably right in silence wasn't thinking about that all i was  thinking was all this has to like this the sun has to go i felt like a night of the living dead  i was just waiting for sunrise and hoping that i didn't inadvertently get shot in the head  thinking i was a zombie it was very very uh awkward so so i just kind of you know wrote it out 
[00:42:00]  and waited the sun came up and then i figured i just let it you know uh attribute it to the beers  or something like that like he's you know drunk and yeah you know not not saying that he's not gay  now i knew you know i knew that was it gay guy but what do you do you know i wasn't gonna uh like  all of a sudden just completely not hang out with him but no more sleeping in the tree house  still went fishing did you yeah drop your pole into the water no pole jokes no nothing like that 
[00:42:30]  but then years later let's see about 19 uh uh 1905 no 19 and uh 80 uh 88 something somewhere like  like that we uh me joe curry my brother a few friends went out to california do some hunting hang  out with dad uh broke back mountain no not broke back mountain for your lost love because as as we 
[00:43:00]  went shut up one that got away it was voices a little deeper can i your jeep jeep jeep jeep jeep jeep  you're in a motel age you had to retreat for spray how did i end up here again uh no it was um  yeah like 1988 something like that i wish i knew how to quit you right yeah and um we we were out 
[00:43:30]  there like i said doing some hunting manly things and uh richard shows up so like oh you know uh  you want to go hunting but he was um he was uh gonna go um curtain shopping with uh with my father's  wife so he couldn't go hunting so yeah it wasn't just a fluke thing well maybe there's somebody  needed curtains yeah the tree house yeah yeah maybe the tree had the tree house was long gone at that 
[00:44:00]  point so virginity uh yes it was but by a woman wait did he sound gay when he talked to him like  uh yeah kind of got that affectation to the voice that little you know curtains things yeah yeah but  still you know i'm not gonna alienate somebody nothing chases you away what i gotta do is friends  with the guy yeah so uh you know but but that never came up never got brought up or anything it's 
[00:44:30]  very odd very odd situation because the entire time i'm talking to him that's all i'm thinking  and he is too believe me is is that no but at this point i'm figuring he's probably been through quite  a few dudes you know so i'm but all i'm thinking about is jesus christ this guy wanted to you know  give me okay yeah this i'll just talk over it how do i get rid of my brother and joe curry 
[00:45:00]  long flight you want to just get back my little feet's up in a meister row  no so i did you know it was it was again another awkward situation so uh this time now last week  last week last week i go here's the update all right to capistrano yes uh fine richard of course  dropping no in a long time i'm with my girlfriend having a drink at the swallows inn  coincidentally enough 
[00:45:30]  i'll have the jeep jeep jeep jeep please yes sir would you like that in the glass doesn't matter  just throw it on my back  do you want a drink wait a minute now so uh i uh i have an update on richard all right  he's dead don't laugh that was a friend of mine he's dead really died in uh 2001 
[00:46:00]  39 years old of what was listed as pneumonia oh no jesus christ  would you stop with the laughing sound  it was very it was a little shocking to me  yeah felt bad who saw that coming besides anybody 
[00:46:30]  yeah it was uh being that 39 pneumonia being that like you know from that generation which is not  long ago but that's not a responsible gay guys really so he ran through the 80s  oh that's all i was thinking he shuffled through the 80s because his pants were pulled down all the  time right it just must have been because uh i was talking about you know when i was out there it 
[00:47:00]  was you know the late late 70s so you're talking from that time on you know you can't just go like  that all promiscuous and not come up with something unless you're lucky and the fact that  he wanted to uh take care of you probably a big bottom probably a big bottom oh you think so now  you're analyzing uh that where well well if he had what was he gonna do hey will you my  i would respect him a little more especially if he grabs your curly delicious locks you can't just

[00:56:30]  wonderful  he knows how to use his words  with the ever increasing popularity of skin diving  it is only reasonable to conclude that the topless would become a very important adjunct to the sport  with very little training the novice can learn to use her breathing apparatus below the surface of the water quite readily  and many relaxing and satisfying moments can be achieved  particularly when amateur motion pictures are employed to record the pleasurable event 
[00:57:00]  that was just a skin diving  that was just an excuse to get the girls in water  underwater  yeah of course  were they doing some snuba  snuba  the topless  just getting uh  just coming up with excuses to get the girls topless in all these situations  in bouncy cars  underwater  in mud  running through the forest  the dance of the muff  do they show any bottom of it or just top 
[00:57:30]  uh no it's the art of the topless  yeah  they don't want to mess it up with the art of the bottomless  when I'm doing the topless  it's different than my exotic  that's the girl from the beach right with the little pigtails  yeah  it's different  I could be wild and free  when I'm doing the topless  the topless  there's a whole thing  who knew  all right back to uh  one of the girls  here's a european girl  talking about  her art 
[00:58:00]  of the topless  good  in europe  men and men and women are together  and they feel like  make love  they aren't going to make love  and in america  well  they go  in a roundabout way  asking well  you want to see my stamp collection  if he wants to see a stamp collection  fine  but he wants to make love  what I should tell him  there shouldn't be no shame  in wanting to make love  like there's no shame  in wanting to  eat steak  or drink water  or milk  or liquor  or whatever  on the other hand  I do not like the rude approach  a man can always be very romantic 
[00:58:30]  and a man can  um  I will seduce a woman  if he knows how  because most of the time  a woman gets seduced  much more mentally  at first  but if that's what he wants  he should seduce  and not talk about  his stamp collection  what is this stupid  talking about  what  she doesn't want to hear  about your stamp collection  oh is that it  yeah  something about stones though  that's what I heard  was she talking about rocks  yeah 
[00:59:00]  in her head  the stones weren't that popular  no okay  we're just coming onto the scene  she was talking about the rolling stones  no I don't know  I thought she was talking about  like rocks or something  yeah she's  I couldn't understand  a word she was saying  she might as well  talk out her  all right back to the announcer here  Berlin today is a city divided  with the eastern sector  under the cruel domination  of communism  and West Berlin  part of the free world  located only a stone's throw 
[00:59:30]  from the fashionable  Kerferstendom  the Broadway of Berlin  we encounter  the Fair Lady Film Bar  where a bunda vita  the bosom bountiful  is about to begin her act  of bosom bountiful  is that what he said  I think so  I think I gotta go back  the bosom bountiful  a tongue baby  film bar  where a bunda vita  the bosom bountiful  is about to begin her act  of primitive passion 
[01:00:00]  capacity crowds flock  to see a bunda vita  fantastically developed  exercise her magnificent  pectoral pulchritude  as she wantonly entertains  the sporting crowds of Berlin  with fierce intensity  I love it  how can that not be  your favorite film ever  like two V2 rockets  on her chest  we wanted to play  this movie  during the ONA  traveling virus  as people were coming in  but we can't do it  for some reason  it's so harmless man 
[01:00:30]  it really is  it's not porno  it's not like guys  and girls together  having sex or anything  it's just chicks  dancing ridiculously  with their bottoms on  and their tops off  that's all it is  can't have that kind  of nudity  in a building  where the union  takes 30% of marriage  how about this  how about we do  a Mondo Topless  showing in the parking lot  at the tweeter center  before the ONA  traveling virus  that'd be good  where could we do it though  we just gotta get a hold  of the pest  we'll give them a copy  of the tape  and they do it upright  will the troopers 
[01:01:00]  patrolling  the parking lot  have a problem  no  showing smut  is it smut though  it's from like  it's like from 1960  I know  how do you even  look at that  I don't even know  the year of the film  well no but the thing  is in a state run  building like that  you can't show  toplessness  because you're too busy  serving alcohol  which will cause  a lot of your patrons  to drive home  and kill a family  of six  yeah there you go  so don't show breasts  because they might  be too busy drinking 
[01:01:30]  yeah perish the thought  they think about bosoms  on the way home  on the way home  keep drinking  we gotta show  this Mondo  Topless tape  because it's hard to get  you must see it  I went into Tower Records  recently  that's where I got  my copy  yeah  can't find it  and at the time  it was the only  you know  it was the only  Russ Meyer film  available  who's getting money  from that  like you bought it  who got the like  buck  royalty from it  someone bought the rights 
[01:02:00]  probably in the 70s  and it's just  yeah  like a check  comes through  and goes  who the hell  bought Mondo Topless  why are all these  people buying it now  all of a sudden  what the hell  in these 22 markets  a resurgence  Chris from Illinois  this tired Mondo Topless  BS wasn't funny  the first three times  enough already  the narrator has  a unique voice  and the sluts are dumb  we get it  move on  okay so how about this  we're gonna finish the bit  why don't you turn  something else on  in Illinois  yeah Chris  why don't you go check out  Eric and Kathy 
[01:02:30]  yeah  just leave  idiot  I'm sure they're doing  riveting radio today  yeah  so if you don't like it  turn on our competitor  whoever that is  and don't come back  what do you think  of that  because we love  this stuff  right  here's another girl  show us for us  that's right  not you  that's right  you don't get it  are you almost done  I don't want him  to  don't leave  don't come back  come back  I was kidding  guys that don't know  how to dance  and they should  whenever they come over  to the apartment  I'm always trying 
[01:03:00]  to teach them  new steps  and how to dance  and they're very  inhibited  they always  feel a little  self conscious  and they want to  have a few drinks  first  who wants to dance  in your stupid apartment  no kidding  fooling idiot  they're trying to  they're trying to  bang this girl  and she's like  you gotta take your  two arms  and throw them  back towards you  shut up  I did the whole  dance thing  was just to get  in the apartment  I didn't really  want to learn to dance  trying to bang  this broad Henry  all right  Joe boy 
[01:03:30]  prejudiced against  the polka  all right  back to the announcer  talking about  Heidi Richter  Hamburg is the  second largest city  in West Germany  and continental Europe's  most vital harbor  let's journey uptown  to the Casino de Paris  the perfect place  to cast Anchorage  for pleasure  and peek in  on Heidi Richter  a tall blonde  Aryan beauty  of perfect proportion  and watch her  as she squirms 
[01:04:00]  and rides  topless  on a luxurious bed  contorting  her supple body  in a manner  which defies  description  come on now  how can you not  enjoy this  you're a jackass  if you don't love  what that guy  just said  how do you not  love him  I can listen  to this guy  all day  defies description  he doesn't even  try  contorting her  on a  what did he call it  a fancy bed  some kind of bed  luxurious bed

[01:06:00]  asked me  would you  like to  be a  playmate  or try  for playboy  magazine  and so  I thought  of her  so no  never  but then  I don't  know  what changed  my mind  but  I just  tried for  it  and I  didn't  make it  the reason  being that  this is what  they said  that my  bus line  was too  big  no he  probably  didn't  want to  sleep  with  half  who  wouldn't  want to  buy  this  buxom  broad  a  fidelity  diamond  her boobs

[01:30:00]  with an extra copy of a chromosome  in her genetic makeup  that causes people with down syndrome  to have learning disabilities  that can be mild or severe  heart defects are common  there are also physical symptoms  such as an enlarged tongue  that can cause words  to sound slurred  and extra folds of skin  under the eyes  and by the way  they said learning disabilities  that can be severe or mild  yeah  i've never seen somebody

[01:35:30]  effer  quick question  so then they had a dump  and no one heard it  uh oh mark  when did you get the wow  stickers man  i've been asking for that  i haven't got it  i signed up on the website  well uh  you have to find opie funny  first  yes  or they don't allow  how long have you been  listening to the show  honestly  look mark  i would be the first person  to tell you that i'm not  the funniest guy in this show  that's not  no i don't think you're an idiot  i don't think you're an idiot  or nothing  is that what you just said  i don't think you  i'm an unsung hero  unfortunately  yes  i like the show  i'm an unsung hero 
[01:36:00]  i uh  steve is the wheatless idiot  yeah i would never  wheatless  i would never  he was wheatless too  fats all eat as carbs  so how long have you been a fan  of this show man  um  i was  back in uh  you guys were in new york  a few years ago  i used to listen  and then  were you ten  alright  yeah basically  alright mark  i'm sorry you hate me  back here  i started listening again  i'm sorry you hate me mark  now go get your effing dustpan  but i'd be the first to admit  i'm not the funniest on this show  but that's not really 
[01:36:30]  go get your shine mom  not really my job  so it's an extra bonus  when i do make people laugh  see  alright mark  happy  good luck to you  happy  happy bowl  speaking of wow stickers  i  won them over  i don't even know who to blame on this  but uh  we had that huge show  at the pnc art center  saturday night  over 12,000 people showed up  a perfect opportunity  to hand out wow stickers  there were no wow stickers  i think  people did have a problem  yeah but i know what  but i know what it is  for the  when you go to these venues  they don't want you to give them  out when they're heading in 
[01:37:00]  because they don't want them  to stick it on everything  right  well why not hand them out  after the show  what could that possibly cost  the radio station to do  to get a lot of wow stickers  out there  the only excuse  that's allowable  is if they say the venue  was specific  and demanding  about not having them  at all  at the venue  but i don't know why  you couldn't give them  as they're leaving  just hand them the street  that's kind of a bummer  because i saw a lot of  feedback on that  that they wanted wow stickers  yeah  and have them at the show  well the venue probably  couldn't figure out a way  to make money off of it  yeah good point 
[01:37:30]  right 30 percent  that's right  they were really good  the merch people  good job  make us stand in the rain  all right we're gonna regroup  you guys want to continue  with this  oh yeah  jesus yes  couple with down syndrome  getting married  we haven't even met the groom  oh yeah  we haven't met the groom yet  you're right  all right ralphie may in studio  it's the ona virus  spreading across america  hey this is frank vinson  hi everybody  this is travis tritt  hey folks  my name is henry roland  hey what up y'all  this is tracy morgan  hey this is tommy chong  and you're listening to pot talk  hey this is richard dreyfuss  and you're listening to opnm  i love this

[01:42:00]  to be in the place  we never went down that road  we went to a couple of parties  that were thrown for um  magazines  just say that  well we were invited to those  yeah we were invited  those were easy  that's what i mean  but the thing is  you just had to check her name  off the list  you kind of sit in the vip section  and we were just sitting there  and it's like  this really sucks  there's really nothing going on  yeah it's not fun  it's not fun  i'm not gonna dance  what am i gonna do  ooh  no  that's not me

[01:43:00]  yeah  i couldn't get enough of it  that's a permanent save on the dvr  it's still on there  believe me  it's got the little diamond next to the  yeah  that's it  do not erase  no matter what  i don't care  second coming of christ  don't erase this for that  and someone has to say  why is that on tv  really  why is that on tv  because it's titillating  and uh  they're trying to  it's it's a little naughty  it's a little naughty  it is naughty  when they came out  in swimsuits  it's a bit taboo  these are girls  between 
[01:43:30]  15  and 19 years old  in  swimsuits  that are  parading around the stage  to be judged  on  i like how they put it  physical fitness  it wasn't  when i heard that  i thought i was like  ah  physical fitness  brilliant  that's a brilliant way  to say  we're gawking at their bodies  because that's what the guys are doing  they're watching  and it's like  they'll be judged on  physical fitness  and poise  poise  what the hell is poise anyway 
[01:44:00]  i don't know  i was looking at their poise  who cares  yeah who cares  they were  all of them  were just like stunning  you know what's funny is  uh  there were some that  like you said  there was like 15 to 19  yeah  and then i felt like the 19 year olds  were like alright honey  give it up  alright  you're old  yeah  trying to put the show  long in the tooth  like a horse that can't run anymore  yeah  put her out  yeah  because there were some girls  and now  before the swimsuit competition  i didn't know their ages or anything  and then a little later on 
[01:44:30]  they come out and say  hey she's 15  and i looked  and i swear  i turned to my girlfriend  and i said  there is no self-respecting guy  in this country  that wouldn't have sex  with that girl right there  and my girlfriend agreed  well let's see what damien thinks  damien uh  damien uh  sex with 15 year old girls  comment  i'd love to comment on that  yeah  that's my  yeah  it's wrong  this might be his last business  why don't we push it a little bit  it's time to push it with damien  show up 12 at the trial 
[01:45:00]  my point is  damien what were you really thinking  on that stage  as they're parading around  they don't look  their age  Miss Americas even  they always look  when they're supposed to be  early 20s  i guess  and that  and they always have this  kind of  you don't quite know  how old they are  some 20  30 thing  because they have a lot of  makeup on  these girls look  well these girls also  there's a big montage  and stuff  and a lot of them  are doing very  like they're like  playing with bunnies 
[01:45:30]  on the beach  yeah little girly things  you know  they're like  you know  with big balloons  and stuff  and they're like  popping balloons  and it's like  just stuff  that like you know  giggling  talking about homework  riding off on mopeds  that's fun  and they  but then they come out  and they're made up  and they're hair  and they don't look  like they're  underage girls  these girls look like  they are in their 20s  and you can absolutely see  how guys would get in trouble  why did you come to this house  was it for sex  it's a dateline special 
[01:46:00]  beauty pageant  speaking of which  you said you came  for her physical fitness  physical  when I heard that one  I screamed  it's like  they'll be judged  on physical fitness  oh is that how  they got away  with looking at  underage girls  in bikinis  damn it  how did you get  these kids  I loved the show  I don't know  what was the ratings  on that  it had to be huge  of course  it had to be huge  you know what's funny too  is I came back  to New York  the next day  and one of my  doormen 
[01:46:30]  he opens the door  he goes  hey man great job  on the Miss Teen  and I go  oh great that's cool  and then I think about it  and I'm like  well it's kind of cool  that he watched  it's also kind of weird  because he's like  he's like a 50 year old dude  yeah he's watching  these young girls  and I'm like  that's kind of weird  you did do a good job  by the way  it was easy  was it  yeah  it's all  it's all scripted  and stuff  it's taken care of  yeah  he could do this stuff  in his sleep  yeah you did  did a good job  because it's not like  because then there would  just be like  the staring  and going  what  yeah  that would be a bad job 
[01:47:00]  yeah no  I needed words  the what  the what  you're pretty  boobies  speaking of the  dateline thing  really fast  because we were  talking about this  yesterday  Conan O'Brien  doing that skit  yeah  we got the audio  ah the controversy  oh no no  well  they had to  apologize  yeah they apologized  for the plane  crash thing  it was obviously  a pre-taped bit  it was a pre-taped bit  that was supposed to be  a goof on the show  Lost  where he  is in a plane crash  this is what started up  the Emmys  the Emmys  and they said 
[01:47:30]  it was very tasteless  and should have been pulled  because of the plane crash  that they had  at the Lexington  airport  so what  changed the opening  to the Emmys  because  it had nothing to do with  because 49 people  and their families  were affected by something  it's tragic  so the rest of us  have to suffer  but it's  Jesus  I wasn't quite  putting it that way  what I'm saying is  it is tragic  that people lost their lives  but it's so separated  that one thing  has nothing to do  with the other  so why  and I don't think 
[01:48:00]  if you lost a loved one  in a plane crash  you're going to just be  sitting down  watching the Emmys  to tell you the truth  they didn't even see it  I don't think  they had to make  some arrangements  it wasn't like  you know  Conan O'Brien  was playing the pilot  you know  I'm going to make  a wrong turn here  yeah  hey let's take off  on the short runway  go to the Shrine Auditorium  yeah it was a goof  on Lost  but like any network  but the uproar  it's like  this was obviously  taped way in advance  yeah it's ridiculous  it's like just  you know  enjoy the show  for God's sake 
[01:48:30]  yeah  or don't watch it  turn it off  I'm talking about  Conan O'Brien  doing the Dateline skit  oh yeah  because that was  the beginning of it  was the plane crash thing  and then he did  a whole skit  and it ended in  the Dateline  a goof on the Dateline  Predator  I love that  those are great  those suck me in  oh  as long as it don't  suck you in that front door  to meet up with a guy  to tell you  have a seat  yeah  what are you doing here  did you see the guy  who brought his kid  oh yeah  oh yeah  did you see that  oh yeah  seen them all  they're all stars  they're all stars 
[01:49:00]  yeah  how many are  they're up to what  the 20th one now  something like that  they knew they hooked up  to something huge  right  alright here we go  Conan O'Brien  the Emmy sketch  about Dateline  hello  anybody here  I'm Chris Hanson  with Dateline NBC  oh god  okay  now what you think  welcome to another edition  of To Catch a Predator  I'm looking for the Emmys  I'm hosting  hosting  that's what you call it 
[01:49:30]  yeah  it's my second time  so you've done this before  yeah  no I did it one time  and I liked it  and I thought I should  do it again  of all the predators  I've met  this guy  screen name  Conebone69  are the creepiest  this is kind of  you think it's  very easy to explain  explain it then  okay  and then he rocks  he runs and gets  tackled  and he runs away 
[01:50:00]  it's always the same  house too  yep  yeah  you walk in that  back door you should  know oh no  I'm in the house  I've seen this kitchen  before  oh no  oh the Viking  countertop  14 and wants me bad  I'll be out in a minute  I'm just gonna get  something to drink  oh no  and I'm in the house  and the voice is coming  from the other room  I made some cookies for us  oh did she  oh no  a girl I know does that  she's one of the voices  and I had to go do a  stupid seller spot  last night  because she was like 
[01:50:30]  do you want to listen in  I've actually got audio  of her talking  to a predator  she plays a young girl  I don't think she  she goes to  I get to the chopper  oh not that predator  sorry  that's everyone  yes  it's Jesse the body  I've been seeing her  come on do it  do it  come on have sex  with him  she does the little  girl voice  oh okay  for me I mean  sicko  let's say hi to  Marty in Ohio  Marty  good morning  hey Marty  hey I just wanted to tell 
[01:51:00]  Ant that it sounds  like his perv switch  is operating correctly  this morning  oh yeah  my perv switch  why  the bit that you did  with the old guy  in the subway  with some teenage girls  you got no one to  throw that perv switch  I'm punching him  oh good  I was going to press  the button  but he crashed himself  I don't think he quite  put it clearly enough  I uh  yeah  I just enjoyed the show  I thought it was a  good um  beauty pageant 
[01:51:30]  blew away  uh  blew away the other ones  uh  the poise  the question  um  the question  and the little  statement thing  they did at the end  was just hysterical  oh my god  I was cringing  at some of those  it's like when the judges  got to ask a question  and uh  you realize how old  they are  when they answer  and you realize  why  guys aren't just  flocking to these girls  cause they're stupid  they ask them questions  and they had no clue  what  what the answer was  what is 
[01:52:00]  what is um  integrity  mean to you  well let's  keep doing  you know  reading  I don't  I have not a clue  what integrity  nicer car than the  lexus  the opposite of  out-tegrity  I really  don't  I'm pretty  language of origin  it's the key  and the bee  how many times  did you watch  this show  at  eight  oh my god  I'm a big fan

[01:53:00]  you know  nice  we don't get invited  to those anymore  nah  we used to go  get invited to those  all the time  yeah  oh well  what are you gonna do  it happens  oh we gotta remind people  it's in uh  daily news today  oh Letterman  you guys are open  Anthony are listed  actually in Letterman  today doing it  uh Thursday night  taping am I correct  ooh yes  Thursday night taping  uh 1130  with uh  be nervous  who you ask  what  what did you just say  are you nervous  did you say be nervous  yeah  yeah  I'm trying to not be nervous 
[01:53:30]  why would you say that  cause it's Letterman  I know  I know  why would you do that to us  oh Damien  I know  you can fool yourself  all you want  but when you  when you  you know  okay  they're keeping that  little waiting area  I know  and now open Anthony  you see Letterman  you're gonna freak out  that's all that  I woke up last night  yes  see  completely  I woke up last night  1230  1230  I woke up last night  I couldn't get to sleep  until 3 in the morning  cause all that was rolling  through my head  was Letterman Thursday  it's like the biggest 
[01:54:00]  first date you'll ever have  yeah  that's what it is  did you do well  most important first  I have no idea  totally like  you become  you have no idea  become somebody else  you just want it to be over  right  you just want it to be over  so that you have done it  and then you got  then you tell people  you did it  and I did it  but you never watch it  hey did you have cue cards  at all by the way  cause I've done stand up  on Leno  and you always have  cue cards  do you have them  Letterman does  Letterman does  but they do a pre-interview  with you too  so you have a pre-interview  yeah we're doing that  Thursday  Thursday morning 
[01:54:30]  you guys will be great  I might take Luke Wilson's advice  what  he told me  down a couple of Heinekens  before you go on  he said not too many  you don't want to go out  being drunk and stupid  but it'll loosen you up  a little bit  and I'm thinking  who wouldn't know  but Luke Wilson would know  well the writers of the show  are big fans  so hopefully they'll  tell Dave what to ask us  oh boy  oh thanks  and now  and think of this too  who  where do we sit  we're two guys 
[01:55:00]  please sit  on each other's laps  well they only have  that one chair  they have one chair  and they've got that  big couch  they said that  they don't like having  like you know  two guests at the same time  this is very unusual  yeah  they rarely do it  yeah I think  Abbott and Costello  were the last  double guests they had  here's the thing  about being nervous  if you acknowledge  that you're nervous  it's an energy  you can use  it's a healthy thing  to have  just understand  that it's there  and it's supposed  to be there  if you're not  and I  I babble 
[01:55:30]  it doesn't  dude  humiliating yourself  in front of the whole country  is not  something to worry about  shut up  I hope we  Mr. Leno  how many times  I hope we bomb  oh don't say that  he won't let it happen  of course not  he doesn't want you to bomb  it's not a confrontation  just flop sweat  pouring down our faces  how long have we  we've had  it's almost over  it's gotta be  30 seconds  we've been sitting  you tell the big story  it's weird too  it's weird 
[01:56:00]  because no one sees this guy  outside of the show  so when you're there  at least when I was doing it  my first couple questions  he was throwing at me  I don't know what I was saying  I was on autopilot  because I'm staring at like  at you know  at him  yeah you're like  oh my god  it's Letterman  he's a human being  he's got a mole  on his index finger  it's like oh my god  I'm just taking  I'm drinking this guy down  oh this is all the stuff  that's been just  plaguing me  and you're  confirming the whole thing  I was doing alright  until  five minutes ago  wait now can you meet him first 
[01:56:30]  no  supposedly not  I don't know  that's a good thing  he doesn't meet anybody  ever  he doesn't want to  no  maybe that's for him  because he has to be  maybe spontaneous  yeah  it's his thing  he's got a method to the  okay  hey hope if you do bomb  there's a custodian going  I told you so  I knew it  I knew it was gonna happen  wouldn't you rather go on  with Anthony  than you're by yourself  oh yeah of course  yeah no you'll be fine  don't worry about that  oh we'll be alright  if we play off each other  like we do  we'll be fine 
[01:57:00]  he's the best dude  yeah he is  he's the best  let's touch him  I have a great line  what you say is  when it's going  we say you know  we're together so much  people call us  frickin freck  thank you  goodnight  oh you should throw out  the worst cliched lines  just one after another  so it's not even funny  for not being funny  here's Nigel from Kentucky 
[01:57:30]  uh Nigel  yes I just wanted to tell you  Opie and Anthony  when you're on TV  don't worry  don't be nervous  don't think about  the millions of people  watch  this is what we do  you bastard  I know  I was just  I was thinking  I'm going to make  the Cindy Brady face  where she just sits there  what was it  Baton Rouge  the spelling bee  or whatever it was  I'm going to picture  David Letterman  in his underpants  that'll do it  that'll help me  yeah let's all use  Brady Bunch rules  well it's Thursday night  we'll be on Letterman  you're going to click  better than you think 
[01:58:00]  again because it's  not a confrontation  he needs you to succeed  to make this show good  Julianne Moore will be good  but she's not going to  be a particular hoot  do some Boogie Nights  references  huh  hey it's kind of weird  seeing her sitting here  without her head bobbing  good point Dave  well she's not  she's not going to be there though  what do you mean  Letterman's different  when you're done  you're done  you don't move down the couch  no couch  how about this  the first thing you do  is wipe the couch off  and go  did somebody spill yogurt  oh I forgot  the Boogie Nights girl  is here  and then put your hand up 
[01:58:30]  for a high five from Dave  you've got some good ideas  I had to do this  great idea  you're a pro  he's an idea man  we'll continue with  Damien Fahey and Ralphie  May in just a bit  it's the ONA virus  spreading across America  Opie and Anthony  these guys  thrash  hard  come on  no  it's the Opie and Anthony show  it's the Opie and Anthony show

[02:03:00]  because we're in the middle  of talking about the couple  with Down Syndrome  getting married  and we know this would be  just bad for his career  well we have to help  our friends  is there opposition  to the marriage  no  no  as a matter of fact  it's audio  and it's from a show  that was treating this  with all the dignity  that it is due  so I don't see a problem  with maybe playing  a little of it  right  maybe  I want to hear  from the groom  like Ralphie brought up  we haven't heard  from the groom yet  well a lot of people  are requesting  their wedding song  Time of My Life  oh nice

[02:12:00]  All right  Cool  Hey  Walkover  The walkover's over  We decided to start walking  We walked  We walked  While you listened to all those crappy promos  That was it  We gave you nothing today  Nothing  We got no walking like it  Well, we did something unusual  We ended the first half of the show very early  We got downstairs  Steve said  Why would Jim's mic work?  There's five or six minutes before we start the walk  We said screw that 
[02:12:30]  We're gonna walk now  So now we're outside XM and you got no walk today  No walk  Is he working?  Yeah  Am I on the radio?  You're on the radio  Yeah, I hear you now  Hi mom  But we're done with the walk  Okay  You missed a lot too  Shit dicks  Oh, the action pack  It was a big all of your business  There was nothing  We made the right call today  Wow  Why don't we go inside and start the second half of the XM show there  We'll kind of recap  Yeah, we'll recap what happened on the walk  On the walk  Don't walk 
[02:13:00]  XM to the key  Messicans  That sucks  Lesbians  I like that in a woman  And every other kind of TV  I love paying for sex  This moral decay  Huh?  Weakens our resistance  Dude  The enclosque of the communist masters of deceit  We're a bunch of scumbags  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children  Jackass  I can't believe it  It's a pedophile humor  Woo  It's depressing and horrendous  It's awful  A bunch of idiots 
[02:13:30]  Perversion  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program  The virus  The Opie  And Anthony  God, that irritates me  It's just like  Somebody took a bath to my brain  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us  Opie  I want my coffee  Anthony  I want that fact  Jim Norton  I want Ozzy  We are going to dumb this thing down  To the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children 
[02:14:00]  It's terrible  The Opie and Anthony show  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  On the road  That's a huge bit  We don't need to know who knows  The next one is under the road  Or the Sigma  We leave there  We don't need to know how old is 
[02:14:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:30]  Welcome to the second half of the Opie and Anthony show.  We made the right call.  There was nothing going on out there.  Nothing.  We ended early.  We didn't want to sit in that breezeway for like five or six minutes and get yelled at.  So we started walking.  Grouch.  No real big deal.  Stench of vomit was still heavy in the air.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, that puke is still there.  Still there.  From yesterday.  It's kind of scabbed over.  So we did something a little different today. 
[02:16:00]  Let's go to Nico in D.C.  Nico, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I started off today calling out Anthony, but what the fuck is auction packed for the walkover?  People are outbidding each other?  Did I say auction packed?  Yes, you did.  All right.  I might have made a mistake.  What can I do about that?  Can't take it back.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  Punch it out.  So why?  Auction packed.  I'm in action, I think. 
[02:16:30]  Punching out indeed.  All right.  God, we were just getting into that Down Syndrome thing.  Yes.  And then Damien walked in.  We couldn't do it to the guy.  No.  That's how we mend this career.  That's how we blow friendships.  There's the John Carr video.  We were talking about this morning.  Him in first class.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you the reason that there's first class who's in business, and I think that's  more about the guys who are taking him as opposed to him.  You think?  I know it is. 
[02:17:00]  They're probably not going to fly their own marshals and coach.  They're flying the FBI guys in business.  Yeah.  And that's why.  It's not about him.  It was about them.  Plus, he hasn't been charged or anything.  So just to get him back, if that's what they have to do, who cares?  What a creep.  That looks comfy, though.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  Is he sitting the other way?  Well, I'm sitting the other way.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  It looked like I was sitting backwards.  You can.  Nah, he was...  My phone ringing.  I can't...  Well, I'm British Airways business class.  You face both ways.  I wouldn't care for that. 
[02:17:30]  You're going to take the phone call live on the show?  No.  You got any bottled water, please?  It was nothing.  Thank you.  Text.  That would have been fun, though.  Yeah, but it wasn't a phone call.  Oh, coffee.  Anything?  Thank you, sir.  Movie?  Not today, thanks.  Why is Jimmy practicing boxing moves?  Because I've been working out in a heavy bag.  I only did eight rounds yesterday.  Bing, bing.  Can I have my way?  I'm not done.  You got the water.  You're right back. 
[02:18:00]  Ralphie, did he ask you?  For coffee or anything?  Yeah.  He did over at CBS.  Anything.  Anything.  We almost got into a confrontation with one of the guys that works in this building.  That's always the case.  Oh, the elevator douchebag?  No, that guy's just a dumb chimp.  Some business guy, he cuts me off and pretty much pushes me to get in the front door.  And then goes to the doorman.  Oh, these guys.  Well, I yelled at him as he walked through after he was by you.  I yelled, hold the door for me. 
[02:18:30]  And then he goes, hold it yourself.  He doesn't like the hijinks.  He doesn't like the fact that we're younger than he is and enjoying life without a fucking  faggoty tie around our neck.  We come here for hijinks and shenanigans and he comes to work for a living.  And by the way, what are y'all now, like a gazillionaires?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Good for you.  What happened to me?  Take all the white people's money.  Yeah.  What happened?  Dump sheets?  Let me think.  Fucking dump sheets, kid.  Come on.  What happened?  Let's get into the dump report.  We haven't done this in a while.  I don't want to hear we can only use it this way, not that way. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Now we got a problem.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Can't say faggot.  Faggot seems to be a word you can't use.  No, of course not.  Wow.  Man, that's the first time I've been doing it.  What about half a fag?  You can't use faggot when referencing a homosexual.  No.  You can use it in general, like shut up, faggot.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Let me tell you what's going on here. 
[02:19:30]  You absolutely can use the word faggot when you're talking about a homosexual.  The FCC has no rules against that.  CBS does.  This is a CBS rule.  Oh, I know.  I'm not saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They don't want you to say the N-word over there anymore.  They don't want you to say the F.  It's kind of faggoty, right?  The F word.  Which one, faggot or faggot?  Politically correct.  We got to deal with political correctness with CBS.  Come on, man.  That's nuts.  The FCC is already making it hard enough to do a radio show.  We could do it, but don't start taking other things away from us. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  What, are gay people going to get mad at this?  Who gives a fuck?  Gay people call each other faggots.  I don't care about that stupid John Liu either.  Can we not do Chinese references?  No.  Stop giving words power.  Exactly.  Man.  You goose.  So, chinks out too?  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  Oh, of course, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, chinks, because the fucking...  The guy, John Liu, this stupid Asian Democrat, was so angry at Survivor, because it was segregationist 
[02:20:30]  the way they were doing the, you know, the racial competing.  Well, there's going to be teams.  There's going to be a black team, a white team, an Asian team, and a Hispanic team, I  believe.  So, John Liu, who just loves seeing his name in print and his face on TV, this guy has  gone after three or four things in the last month alone.  The guy is just on a roll, and he hasn't even seen one episode of the show.  And this asshole's obsessed with being Asian.  His whole fucking life is Asian, Asian, Asian, and now he's yelling at them for being too  ethnic.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Fucking moron.  I would know nothing about that, having lost a dad fan.  God, that fucking...  Oh, true.  There you go.  I gotta go.  I got about that.  All right, so what happened here?  6.48.  I gotta go, faggot.  Ah.  Was dumped out of the show.  Fucking come on.  But you got to hear it here at XSEN.  Yeah.  Holy shit, is that annoying.  Norton's saying that.  Why, because a bunch of fucking gay guys might stand outside with cocks and signs?  Big deal.  Let them.  Let them.  We say let them.  That's hot. 
[02:21:30]  Absolutely.  Norton, during Anthony's childhood story about his friend Richard making a homosexual move  on him in a treehouse.  Yeah.  In this scenario, faggot is clearly a reference for a homosexual and therefore must come out.  Must.  Fuck.  Come on, then.  Come out of the closet.  Yeah.  Came out.  Like faggot's do.  It sometimes makes me piss my pants.  A caller.  That should be all right, too.  Come on, man.  Come on.  You're pissing on yourself.  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  That shit.  Ah, come on.  That shit.  We can't say that shit anymore.  You get better pussy.  Caller.  And hey, you laughed, fucker.  Oh, please.  Yelling at a caller.  The faggot thing.  That makes me fucking sick.  The FCC's out of control.  We don't need the company out of control, too.  You can't say nigger or faggot.  And I understand they don't want these words used harshly or for brutality.  But in the context of humor.  But talk shit, even if we do it that way. 
[02:22:30]  Well, I mean, I can see where they would come and get mad.  But it's ridiculous they're going to fuck with us on that.  Really fucking aggravating.  Gay guys might get mad.  Who gives a fuck?  They took the N-word away.  Now they're taking the S-word.  I should be mad at Paris Hilton's album.  Not us.  Don't be mad at the...  Don't make fun of the Asians.  Eventually that will come out.  Like, don't...  Any Asian stuff.  The penis size.  The John Lew doesn't like it.  Yeah.  Fuck him and his little dick. 
[02:23:00]  That'll happen.  Ooh.  That will happen.  You're going to sue me?  By the way, that was a train wreck when you were talking.  Those almonds in there.  Brutal.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't know.  Are they going to do a dump out of it?  Well, the almond lovers of America don't care for it.  We're doing a lot of interviews lately, and thank God we have Satellite.  That's what we tell a lot of these interviewers.  Yeah, it's a fuck.  Because people are like, how do you deal with all the FCC regulations?  And in general, we can do an FCC-friendly show that's fun, entertaining, funny, clever, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:23:30]  But at times, it's frustrating.  Like today, seeing that they're dumping out the word faggot, but we have XM, thank God, to let it rip still.  To say faggot in its true context.  That's right.  Wonderful.  Let's say hi to Chris in Cleveland.  Chris, what's up?  What's going on?  Fucking, you guys are funny as shit.  You know what?  You should be able to say fucking faggot.  Well, thank you. 
[02:24:00]  What are you talking about?  Hey, guess what?  What?  Click.  Fucking smoking a fast spot listening to you guys on the way to work, man.  Funny as hell.  Yeah?  What did you like about the show today?  What?  What did you like about the show today?  Oh, man.  I just got the satellite radio thing, and I think it's awesome that you can say fucking shit all over the place.  Awesome.  It is awesome.  All right.  Thank you, Chris. 
[02:24:30]  Let's go to Marie in West Palm.  Prime example of someone with nothing.  Marie?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  All right.  Good.  I wanted to let you guys know that I listened to 103.1 while I'm out walking, and I heard faggot, and I heard piss, and I heard several other things that you're saying were dumped out of.  I just wanted to let you guys know that not everybody's dumping.  Were you listening on XM?  No, I listened to XM in the car on the way to work, but I listened to 103.1 while I'm out walking on a regular radio. 
[02:25:00]  See, the list we just read, okay?  We have a guy in New York.  He dumps for all the affiliates.  It's impossible for that to go over the air.  She might have heard faggot.  You might have heard faggot in another context.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And I heard the guy say he pissed his pants.  I heard him say it.  Yeah?  I don't know.  That doesn't make sense.  Yeah, I heard him say it.  I'm just letting you know.  All right.  Thank you, Marie.  We're going to be ruled.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, I'll be coming there.  Who saw this coming? 
[02:25:30]  Dan, Tennessee, what's up?  Dude, I was at Sonic the other day, and there was a midget on roller skates delivering the food.  That's awesome, man.  Wow.  Where in Tennessee?  In Clarksville.  Clarksville, Tennessee?  Is it that exit by the Cracker Barrel one?  Yeah.  I've been there at Sonic.  Damn fine cherry limeade.  You're not talking about exits with one of our callers, are you? 
[02:26:00]  I swear to God, I am.  I know it.  It looks like she's running when she's going to all the cars and stuff.  It's just funny as hell.  I've been trying to tell you all for the last two weeks.  And she works there?  Yeah.  Dan, I'm going to be in Tennessee in a month, and she better be there.  She's there.  What are you going to do if she isn't?  Exit four off of it.  I'll order my cherry limeade and my number two and go on about my business.  Disappointed and sad. 
[02:26:30]  That's how I'll drive away.  Anything else, Dan?  That's it.  Punch it out.  All right.  Meanwhile, back at the show...  Hey, you see this story?  There's a dwarf suing the state over falling from a sink.  He's an ex-inmate, and he was trying to reach mirror to shave.  Here's a picture of the dude.  Oh, jeez.  Picture of the dude.  There you go.  Oh, the poor little guy fell down.  And he was trying to shave.  He's got a beard.  Well, he didn't get the job done, and he's pissed off that he couldn't get a nice shave. 
[02:27:00]  Byron B.J. wrote it.  Never feared for his safety in George's bare-knuckled prison system.  Where did he earn that middle name?  Perfect height.  He does have a flat head.  Yeah.  He went in with the middle name George.  Byron B.J. wrote it.  Never feared for his safety in George's bare-knuckled prison system, even though he's a dwarf.  Tough guy.  All right, so a slippery sink led to his downfall. 
[02:27:30]  Rodan alleges in an ongoing federal lawsuit.  Rodan, who stands four feet one inches tall, has spent about 20 months in prison for dealing  marijuana and possessing meth, according to state records.  Feeling dope.  That guy can't even reach your car window.  It's the weed fairy.  It's the weed fairy.  Nice.  He's a dwarf.  I'd love to see his little legs go when he's on meth.  What do you need, player?  What do you need?  He's smoking his marijuana.  What do you need?  This has got to be good shit, because I'm not sure if this is a dwarf or not. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Why would you even pay him?  A black gnome just brought me my marijuana.  Why pay him?  When he hands you the pot, you go like this.  Thanks.  Get away from me.  You'll leave.  What are you going to do about it?  In the lawsuit, Rodan claims that in April 2004, a guard at the state prison in Jackson told  him to shave.  Rodan told the guard he could not reach the mirror above the sink in his cell.  The guard, according to Rodan, told him to stand on the sink.  Rodan fell off the sink onto the cement floor in his cell, according to the suit. 
[02:28:30]  He injured his back in the fall.  His back already undergone multiple surgeries as a result of the genetic disorder causing  his dwarfism.  Well, what I want to know is, didn't that big midget ass save his fall?  That large midget ass.  He should have sat down.  They get taller.  Disproportionately huge ass.  Rodan said he's not sure how he slipped off the sink.  The only thing I could think of, I shouldn't have been wearing socks standing up there. 
[02:29:00]  Or maybe even those big baby shoes they wear.  Those large doll shoes they wear.  Doll shoes.  An inmate in an adjoining cell claims Rodan is just running a scam on the prison system.  Of course.  Ronnie Fritz, in a deposition, said Rodan purposely fell from the sink and that other inmates  were cheering for him to beat the Department of Corrections.  Rodan, now 23, is trying to get his life back together.  An aspiring rapper and songwriter known as Lil Dirty, Rodan is enrolled in a media and 
[02:29:30]  audio production program at an Atlanta university.  That's what Jimmy calls his cock.  What?  Lil Dirty.  A lot dirty.  Rodan doesn't shave these days.  He now sports a full beard and mustache.  He still bears the artwork of prison life.  Tattoos cover his arms, including drawings of a Joker and SpongeBob SquarePants.  Yeah, he's gangster.  He got the SpongeBob.  Yeah, watch him.  Watch him in a jerk. 
[02:30:00]  So there you go.  That's a sad little story.  Oh.  Let's say hi to Big Daddy in Maine.  Yeah.  Big Daddy.  Yeah.  What's up, Big Daddy?  I just wanted to know, you was talking about faggots.  I was wondering how Fez and Opie were making out.  Uh, well, we got Ron and Fez suspended this week, so, uh, so far so good.  I thought they was on vacation.  Oh, they told you that, huh?  That old gag.  Yeah.  That old gag. 
[02:30:30]  Eh, just wondering.  Well, now you know.  First time caller.  What?  First time caller.  No one cares.  Quack, quack.  Do we really care?  Okay.  Thought you might want to know.  Uh-uh.  We already know it's stupid.  It's on caller ID and the one came up next to it.  That's right.  Excuse me?  We keep track.  We keep track, because your number came up, and a one came up next to it.  It meant you were the first time you were calling.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Let's go to John in New York.  John?  Yeah.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, John.  Thanks a lot for saying so, John.  How are you? 
[02:31:00]  I'm okay.  How you doing, little Jimmy?  Good.  Yeah, Dallas.  Right.  I believe the midget slipped, because he slipped on Bob Kelly's plooge.  Oh, because Bob Kelly likes to have sex with stings.  Very good.  Okay.  Pull back.  Very good, sir.  Very good.  That was much better.  All right.  Bob likes to have sex with stings.  Oh, yeah.  I had no idea.  Yeah, absolutely.  Is that what he calls them?  Huh?  Is that what he calls them?  He's talking about the fucking stings.  He gets up there.  Did you guys hear about the man? 
[02:31:30]  Puts his hand in a certain way and pumps on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, usually the stings that have the little, like, divot.  It's not really fucking a stings.  It's fucking your hand as you lay over a stings, so you don't have to clean up.  It's more out of a latin.  No, he's sliding in and out, because he explained how the slipperiness.  Yeah, but he uses his hand.  Yeah, over the top.  Get him on the phone.  I was assuming he would just take his hand and fuck his hand.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  The sink is definitely more involved than...  Wow, really?  ...than just being the catcher.  I misunderstood. 
[02:32:00]  No, he's like...  Wow.  He's sliding the bottom part of his...  That's not an American standard.  ...boner against the sink, and then he's using the hand.  Wow.  I believe.  All right.  Because he was talking about how some of the sinks have that little divot in front.  What makes you think that's a good idea?  I mean, what other household places do you have to jerk off in before you find the sink  as the one you...  You stop doing that, though.  Like, very early age, where you're experimenting with 30.  Let me see if I can fuck everything. 
[02:32:30]  I'll just try to fuck anything to make it feel good.  Ooh, that ottoman's been looking at me.  Yeah.  I'm going to drop a batch right in between the cushions.  I know there's foam rubber in there.  A little lube.  I'll get it.  I could probably fuck that.  But, yeah, you get to a certain age, Bob Kelly, and he's fucking the sink, and he's in  his 30s.  That's a little sad.  That's a little much.  All right.  The phones are lit, but I don't know what people want to talk about yet.  I bet you some people want to talk about current events.  Travis, can you tell we're struggling? 
[02:33:00]  Help us out here.  Answer the phones a little faster.  Jesus.  Yeah, put down topics.  We got here too early and fucked everyone up.  I know we did.  We figured we'd do something a little different.  What happened?  He was calling Bob now, so...  Oh, okay, okay.  He's trying to get a hold of Bob, and that's why he can't answer the phones.  I apologize, Travis.  All right, that makes sense.  Hey, tomorrow on the show, we got Korn in studio and doing the walkover.  Jonathan Davis and Monkey in studio performing acoustically.  Two or three songs.  That's going to be really cool.  Jonathan Davis is the singer, right?  Oh, yeah.  I met two of those guys that came to Stamped New York when I had to watch Craig Gass. 
[02:33:30]  They're really, really, really cool guys down to earth.  So they're going to be joining us over at 3FM in New York.  Nice.  And then we're going to have tickets to give away to the Family Value Show at Jones Beach  on September 2nd.  And I think we'll hand out the tickets as we walk, like we did last time.  Oh, because that worked out well.  We almost got mugged.  It was cool, though.  Leo in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning, Leo.  Hello, Leo.  Hey, I just wanted to say thank you guys for yesterday.  I called up yesterday asking for more and more bonus, and you guys gave me some, and I'm 
[02:34:00]  happy, and I'm trucking along the interstate toll road here, and I'm happier than anything.  Wait a minute.  Hello, Uncle Leo.  Good to see you, Ralph.  Yeah, I just want to throw a plug out there if I could.  For what?  If my Dallas improv dates?  For the trucking company that I work for.  What's it called?  It's called Dan Parking Company.  You got to say it louder.  Dan Parking Company.  You got to say it louder, dude.  Jesus.  Leo.  You're cutting out. 
[02:34:30]  From Unic.  Yeah.  We want to make sure everyone hears your plug, so go ahead.  Leo, the trucker from Jersey.  He's got to do it.  You're going to hang up on me, aren't you?  No, we're not, dude.  No.  You got to hang up on me.  Just say it.  All right.  From Dan Parking Company.  Problem is your phone kept cutting out, and we kept missing it.  Well, if anybody needs anything heavy or oversized hauled, that's the place to call.  Just say it, dude.  You keep saying that's the place.  Where?  Dan Parking Company.  I don't know what that's about or where it is. 
[02:35:00]  Where are you located?  How much is it to haul stuff?  All right.  You talk.  You would know.  Why would I ask any questions?  Sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  There's one of the on-air personalities.  Apparently, it's your show now.  So, go right ahead.  Plug away, son.  All right.  If that's what makes you feel good, go ahead.  Plug.  Trucking.  No one's trying.  Of course, we know you're a trucker, so it's trucking.  Understandable.  It's in North Jersey. 
[02:35:30]  Just call them if that's what you need.  You don't do anything particularly heavy, right?  Hey, Jamie, you're the best, man.  All right.  Let's go to Dano.  Let that get through.  Dano and PA.  Hello.  I think it's time for the banana song.  Why?  Because these callers stink.  Bye.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Punishment.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  I got to laugh.  I have to laugh.  No, because, you know, this show is so weird. 
[02:36:00]  Like, we talk about some really cool stuff, and you just assume the phones would just light up with their stories and their observations on maybe current events or maybe some stupid story we tell about going snuba-ing or whatever, what have you.  Nothing, right?  I saw the phones ringing like crazy.  I'm like, what the hell did we talk about that people need to call about?  Because we haven't even really started the second half of the show yet.  Uh-huh.  You see what's going on? 
[02:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's say hi to Jack in Tennessee.  Phone's lit, by the way.  Can't even get through.  You're getting a busy signal because too many people are calling about the topic at hand.  Go ahead, Jack.  Go ahead, Jack.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Yeah, I used to fuck between the bed spring and the mattress of my bed when I was a young boy.  The box spring and the mattress, huh?  All it took was Anthony saying you try to fuck everything when you're younger.  Yeah, when you're younger.  And now everyone's calling to tell us what they fucked. 
[02:37:00]  You want the most authentic feel.  Right.  I'll tell you what I tried one time.  Yeah.  And I read this in a book.  A man's asshole?  No, no, no, no, no.  That was absolutely not.  Right?  Right.  I hollowed out a banana peel, and I put duct tape around it, and I filled it with warm  water, and I tried to fuck it.  You learned that.  Rikers?  It didn't go well.  No, I read it in a story, and I tried something between the mattress and bed sheet.  I might have put the banana in there afterwards and tried to fuck. 
[02:37:30]  I did try to fuck something, and it didn't go well.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  It's all about you.  I apologize.  I didn't mean to.  No, no, no.  You talk.  Why would I have anything to say about something like that?  You go right ahead.  Oh, yeah.  I just...  I'm sorry.  I was just trying to rebound and recoup, but apparently...  Does the mattress have two S's?  Know everything.  Yeah, you know everything.  Go ahead.  You have all the stories.  Look, the best thing is to hold your own Vaseline and warm it up in the microwave for just a minute,  and then just stick it on your dick, and it's the best thing ever. 
[02:38:00]  I was never a big fan of Vaseline, to be honest.  I always preferred, like, I mean, as I got older, Eros, other type of lubricant.  I always thought Vaseline was never particularly good.  As a kid, anything.  Yeah.  Slippery, though.  Yeah.  I mean, this was all when I was younger.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Anthony, stop talking.  The host on the phone wants to talk.  Go ahead, sir.  Anthony was rudely interrupting on the radio show titled, Guy. 
[02:38:30]  Floor's all yours, sir.  Forgive us.  All right.  Forgive us.  I'm fucking sorry.  What do you think you're doing?  All right.  You're not going anywhere, Danny.  Thank you, Jack.  That was terrific.  Why is fucking child haircut Danny not going anywhere?  Well, this is a note from a communique from Danny.  Oh.  This is Danny.  Young Danny.  Danny writes.  I like how it starts.  Friend of mine. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Sure.  That means you, Danny, doesn't it?  Danny used to what?  Let me adjust this.  Danny filled a Ziploc bag full of chocolate pudding, put the bag between the couch cushions,  and fuck it.  Why?  Was there a fucking person with colon cancer he had his eye on?  I couldn't tell you because it actually didn't happen to me.  It was a friend of mine.  What did you do besides lick the pudding off when he was done and clean his bag? 
[02:39:30]  A friend told you that?  Yeah, actually, he did.  A friend.  I think we were actually, this is, I mean, we're talking years and years ago.  Like, I think this is probably junior high school.  Was it Bill Cosby?  No.  I think a conversation had come up about what we had used to get that done, and that was  it.  And did you have a story, or after he said that, he just said, I got nothing.  No, I never really went nuts with the whole jerkin. 
[02:40:00]  No?  All right.  That's terrific, Danny.  Take care.  People know how to make the prison one, right?  Which what?  The glove?  The glove and the towel.  No.  What's that?  Take a surgical glove, and you wrap it in a towel very tightly, and then use rubber bands  to keep it tight, and then you roll, like, the cuff.  You leave the cuff kind of sticking out a little bit, and then you roll the cuff up over the  towel that you've just rolled.  Now you have a very tight hole that is lined with a rubber glove. 
[02:40:30]  And you lube it up.  And then you beat a guy over the head with it and fuck him in the ass.  Yeah.  Yeah, you ask him to muffle his cries with it while you rape him.  Well, let's go to Jerry in Texas.  Jerry!  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Jerry?  If y'all would do a show worth a shit, it would be something to call in about.  Oh.  So what are you calling for, Jerry?  Because I'm planning on going seeing little Jimmy Norton this weekend in Dallas.  You're a good boy, Jerry.  His regular size, though, will be appearing there that night. 
[02:41:00]  Not the little one.  I've been writing through email to go to the Vinnie Paul strip club with me, and I haven't  heard back.  Oh, is that you, dude?  Vinnie Paul from Pantera has a big strip club down in Dallas.  And I was, uh, okay, yeah, I would actually be very interested in checking that place  out.  It's my treat.  They have a great rock district in Dallas.  I'm also the one that's keen to enjoy the city.  Remember all those rock clubs we were bouncing in and out of?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.  Fucking Dallas is a great city.  That's how people talk, bounce.  We bounce things out. 
[02:41:30]  We're on a rooftop.  What show are you coming to, Sweet Potato?  Dude, any one.  I don't know which one I can go out.  Maybe I'll do that Thursday night.  Yeah, because I want to, like, I want to wear sweatpants with, like, nothing underneath.  I'd like you to do the same.  I'm going to bring my big faggot friend, Sam Van, with me.  I'll be bringing my big faggot friend, Kenny.  Maybe they could jerk each other off while me and you elbow each other and laugh.  Dude, we'll do this, and I'll email you here in just a little bit from base.  Bye, buddy.  Take care.  Thanks.  All right, thanks, dude.  Just a thought of Kenny jerking off another guy. 
[02:42:00]  I know.  That made me chuckle.  Kenny's little head, and Kenny would look straight ahead.  Are you going to come soon?  He wouldn't want to do it, but his duty calls for it.  Just let me know when you're getting close, please.  So I can move.  Kenny wouldn't even be good at it.  He'd probably put his thumb and pointer finger around the base and just squeeze really tight  and tug from there so he didn't get cum all over his fucking germaphobic hands.  Hey, who else has driven in Kenny's car, by the way?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the fucking right off the showroom car? 
[02:42:30]  The Spotless mobile.  It's 10 years old.  It looks like he drove it off a lot yesterday.  Yeah.  Perfect.  This is why I just hate him.  He won't use his horn, and I figured out why Psycho won't use his horn.  He thinks he gets only so many beeps.  I don't want to use them up.  Like you're going to have an emergency where you need 42,000 beeps.  I knew it.  I'm out of beeps.  Kenny is nuts.  You don't use your horn?  Jim has too much road rage.  That's true.  I have too much stress.  You don't use it at all?  No, I'm a polite driver. 
[02:43:00]  I'm a good driver.  But sometimes you're left with no choice.  You've got to use your horn.  No?  No, I curse at people from inside the truck.  That's loud enough.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's a weird way politicians do, by the way.  Take a little left-right shake, left-right shake.  It's bizarre.  Ugh.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Phony.  Just hit me.  Oh, okay.  I was just, yeah, I saw his vehicle.  It's ridiculous clean.  It's spotless.  Everything's armor-old. 
[02:43:30]  I love leaving my garbage in there.  Like, when I'm done with my latte, I'll just fucking leave it in there and just know that  it goes, good, take care.  And it's always thinking of latte.  Get rid of latte.  Get rid of latte.  Must get rid of latte.  Remember when we were driving to Boston and we stopped for gas?  Yeah.  And I stepped out of his truck right into tar and it was like 105 degrees that day.  Oh, boy.  What'd you have to do?  Ritual, right?  Yeah.  First of all, we tried to, like, clean the sneaker best we could.  There was still way too much tar on it.  So I had to take my sneaker off and throw it into a plastic bag for the rest of the trip. 
[02:44:00]  For the rest of the, uh, yeah.  It looked like Earl melted and Opie stepped on him.  I just want to make things nice for you people.  And then he's trying to tell me it's okay.  He'll just buy a new mat when he gets home.  I'm like, I can't do this to him.  The new mat would be too new for the other mat.  Yeah, so then he'd have to buy a whole set.  Of course.  And he'd love the new mat smell.  Yeah.  He wouldn't open his window so the new mat smell didn't escape. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Let's, uh, let's move on.  Thank you.  That was terrific, Kenny.  Uh, Josh in Connecticut.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, Josh.  Hey, Josh.  I used to, uh, when I was a kid, I used to take ham and bologna out of the meat jar in  the refrigerator.  I used to wrap my shirt up in it and, uh, try to bang off that with the slime with that.  You, um, you fucked lunch meat.  Yes.  Yes, I did.  Did you put it back?  I did it.  It was just, it was, uh, I tried to match it to some box spring and that got too, that 
[02:45:00]  got too warm, so I figured I'd go to the ham and go fly me.  See, the thing was doing it without your hand.  If you could, uh, jerk off without using your hands, that was great because you're just used  to jerking with your hand.  So if there was some kind of contraption you could rig up, uh, on the bed, on the couch,  something where you could not use your hands.  Right.  Or maybe even grab your pillow like they're tits with your hands. 
[02:45:30]  And then, you know, you pump away.  He's a sick fuck, we just haven't gotten into that head of his yet.  Nah, as a kid, jerked off, uh, so many times a day, it was ridiculous.  Like, just, just to the point of, like, I can't do this again or I'm really gonna be  scabbed up for tomorrow's jerking.  So I really can't jerk off anymore today.  The lunch meat guy got creeped out by your story and left on his own.  Yeah, I know, I chased away the lunch meat fucker.  The guy who fucks baloney. 
[02:46:00]  Fuck dead animal.  He fucked dead animal slices.  I fucked an olive loaf once.  I've never.  What?  Wait, what?  I fucked an olive loaf because I like the little, the little pieces in there and I thought  it made me feel exotic.  The pimentos and.  I loved it.  I pulled my dick off like I fucking had crabs and scabs and all this stuff.  Pimento all over my cock.  It was a medley of loveliness.  Oh, let's say hi to Bob and Willis.  Bob.  Yeah.  Hey.  Bob and Willis. 
[02:46:30]  How are you, Willis?  We're good to go.  Yeah.  I'm another stupid trucker.  And anyway.  We don't call truckers stupid.  We don't say they're stupid.  They're just pedophiles.  Oh.  Hooker killers.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Idol.  Yeah.  All right, Dan.  Well, I was going to take a piss in an Arizona ice tea bottle.  Yep.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, well, the neck was looking really good.  And, uh, the neck of a plastic Arizona ice tea bottle.  Looking good.  How does it look good? 
[02:47:00]  How does the neck of a bottle look good?  It's nice and long and narrow and.  Bring us into your world.  But how does that look good?  I don't know, man.  It was just.  It looks sharp.  Yeah, it's sharp.  And doesn't your dick have to be the perfect size?  Like, what are the odds your dick is going to be the perfect size for the bottleneck?  Not that I haven't tried fucking a Snapple bottle when I was a kid.  Yeah, or if you're black, a Gatorade bottle.  It's bigger.  Can I plug my MySpace?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, yeah, because you just gave us some great ratings. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, go ahead.  Why not?  Go ahead.  You deserve it.  Are you linked to either one of us, by the way?  Dude, are you linked to our site?  Are you in our network?  Are you in our personal network?  Do you have one of us as a friend?  Yeah, you have to.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  What's the plug?  Mine is MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  Yeah.  I have a tremendous amount of fans.  Mine is MySpace.com slash Ralphie May.  R-A-L-P-H-I-A. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, man.  No, Jim Norton, actually.  I like Jim Norton.  Yeah.  I like your site, man.  Thank you.  It's a good site.  I have a guy who's going to help me actually update EatABullet.com, one of Steve's guys.  Yeah?  Who sent me a...  All right, dump...  Dump, not gun.  Cool.  Yeah.  Dump, not gun.  That's awesome.  That's it.  MySpace slash dump, not gun.  Top gun.  Gayest movie of all time.  Top gun is cool.  Top gun is very gay.  Top gun.  Top gun.  Get out of here.  John in Virginia, what's up? 
[02:48:30]  Hey, I actually just wanted Anthony to touch on that rubber glove cuff thing again because  my radio cut out and it sounded really, really fun.  Oh, the prison one?  Yeah.  Yeah, you get a rubber glove and then you roll it in a towel, but like leave the cuff  of the glove, a little bit of the cuff hanging out of the towel.  Roll it up tight and then put rubber bands all around it and then take the cuff and roll 
[02:49:00]  it up over the end of the towel and you'll have a tight hole that is made of latex.  Don't forget to give it a name like Richard or Charlene.  No.  Oh, you.  That sounds awesome.  So the rubber bands act as like ribbing?  Yes.  You'll feel a ribbing or some type of a tightness.  Yes.  From the rubber bands.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Here's to you.  He's jerking off thinking about jerking off with it.  That's what I was thinking. 
[02:49:30]  Jesus.  Let's go to James.  What the fuck are you drinking?  Wheat grass.  Wheat grass.  That's great for you, dude.  You're going to vomit right after you drink.  No, you won't.  That's phenomenal for you.  Nothing better than the world.  So they say.  It's like he's doing Jaeger.  People are saying.  Ugh.  Jaeger's a night quill.  It's good for you.  I used to drink that Krabby.  I don't know what it does.  You drop a wicked deuce on it, though.  Huh?  Wicked deuce.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I'm drinking for that reason.  Big time.  I'll go right through you.  My asshole is going to look like a mulch bag.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:50:00]  It's going to look like a lawnmower bag.  I actually shit shredded paper.  I'm going to finish with this.  You ever go to the track and just see one of the horses take a dump?  That's what Norton's asshole is going to look like.  It's a green.  Just, yeah.  Kind of like a volcano.  And just green shit.  The odds change.  No, I won't smell the lid.  It smells like grass.  It's grass.  I don't doubt it smells like a lawnmower.  All right.  Let's go to James in Jersey.  James.  You could smell it in the whole place.  Hey, how's it going?  I used to always jerk off with a pillowcase in between two other pillows on the bed. 
[02:50:30]  And then I would end up having a laundry basket full of used pillowcases.  So you take a pillowcase.  Yeah.  You fold a pillowcase in half.  Put it in between two pillows.  You have to put the one pillow on the bottom a little bit further.  And then the one on top a little bit further out.  And then you put a pillowcase in between so you don't mess up the pillows itself.  Oh, there you go.  And then you just use the pillowcase over and over.  Wow, this would really be hot if girls were calling. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  There's the basic saran wrap.  Do you do it with my hand?  And my uncle.  And my uncle.  The basic saran wrap where you just rip off a big piece of saran wrap, lay it down on  the bed, and just fuck the piece of saran wrap.  How easily amused were you?  Very.  Jesus Christ.  Apparently.  Very.  You got to rub your cock on a cheese grater.  It didn't matter.  You know what it was?  It was just so hard to find a place to jack off when you were a kid. 
[02:51:30]  You don't realize how little time you actually have alone in a private place to jack off.  So whenever I did, it was spent jacking off the whole time.  Like, if I was home sick with a fever, I would just, all I would do is-  Oh, fever boners were the best, though.  Fever bag is like Turkish taffy.  It's just like hanging.  Yeah, yeah.  And you got a fever, you're sick, but you're the only one home.  It's a day off from school.  Everyone else is gone. 
[02:52:00]  Jacking.  That's what you did as a kid.  Any spare moment that you got alone.  Going into the woods.  I'd go into the woods and jerk off.  Let's go to Mark in Illinois.  Fuck a tree.  Mark.  Hello.  Good morning, guys.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that I used to fuck when I was just a kid.  I went up to Great America and won one of those huge six-foot clowns.  And it had those really tiny styrofoam balls in it, like about the size of a BB, but I had 
[02:52:30]  to put the hole in it, like where the belly button was, because when you stood it up, otherwise  all those little styrofoam would fall out.  Yeah.  So, just wanted to let you guys know.  You didn't get a styrofoam little thingy up your dick hole?  Nope.  Nope.  Eef.  That would...  Nope.  I'd be a little suspect of fucking a six-foot clown.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  More chins in a Chinese phone book. 
[02:53:00]  Ah, ah.  Hey, whatever works.  Really?  Whatever works.  Exactly.  I won't critique you.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Rip me up and then fuck me.  Let's say hi to Daryl on Long Island.  Daryl?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  One of my buddies at a house party I threw through told a story about what he used to do in his room in front of a ton of people.  He used to take two thick rubber balloons and lather it up with a ton of shaving cream and have at it right between, put the balloons right between his mattresses. 
[02:53:30]  What you use as a lube, now you might be very desperate as a kid, but what you use as a lube can really make or break the whole situation, my friend.  One time I tried just using soap, regular soap, and once that gets in the tip, it's over, Johnny.  You are in fucking pain like you're taking a piss in your third year of the clap. 
[02:54:00]  It hurts.  Punch it out, boys.  You got to finish, but, you know.  Yeah, right?  Anthony is opening up.  That's what I always talk about how he used to jack as a kid.  Always.  You ever use shampoo?  Yep.  Same problem with the, uh.  Yeah, stinging.  You got to use the baby shampoo and the baby.  You got to be careful with the soap.  I did a radio show with an ER doctor, and he said this guy came in, and the whole skin on his crank had just been ripped off. 
[02:54:30]  Okay?  It was like, it was like a sock hanging on the other side, and he was jerking off with a new soap, and it had a lot more of, uh, like, uh, pumice to it, grit.  Lava?  No, no, it wasn't like lava.  That's what I asked.  If I had some lava.  Lava.  All right.  And, and that's what did it.  It just shredded his tongue.  That is the kind of shit I'm talking about.  Looked like a fucking maxi pad.  He used pumice soap and ground his dick down to nothing. 
[02:55:00]  He used his dick to shit.  What an idiot.  Holy crap.  An idiot.  You got to stop.  Now we're getting sick.  I would love to hear from a couple ladies.  Please.  Yeah, please.  Well, they don't really jerk.  It's whatever they got.  Yeah, but they use some unusual things.  You ever rub something on your dirty snatch, like a cat face?  Girls, uh.  Your tongue tongue.  Young, young girls will, uh, find that, uh, the bathtub, the shower massage.  Yeah.  Things like that.  I've heard those stories.  Yeah.  Uh, the running water out of the tub. 
[02:55:30]  Well, we'll get some ladies on the phone, hopefully.  That's these hot girls on Pow Talk.  Let's go to Darren in Michigan.  Darren?  Aaron.  Hey.  Hey.  Whatever.  Whatever.  What's your name?  We don't care about your name or you, but, uh, your story might, might count.  The best thing to jerk off with, besides my little brother's asshole, is my cat.  No, listen, seriously.  Okay, no, sorry.  Please, stop breaking, stop breaking the room up.  But seriously, my, uh, friend of mine, I mean, I, my, uh, my, uh, my mom used to work 
[02:56:00]  at, uh, a Vizine factory, where they used to make Vizines, so these bottles would come  home all the time.  And the Nike Air had just come out.  And I decided it would be a good idea to fucking pump up my dick.  And now that I'm 30, I think it's probably causing me problems.  What do you mean pump up your dick?  You got, you can't just throw that out without an explanation.  What, what, uh, with a Vizine bottle, with an empty Vizine bottle, you stick the head  down your dick and you pump up your dick.  I'm sure it didn't pump up my dick to make it hard. 
[02:56:30]  It made it hard probably because I was just fucking with my dick.  All right.  You know, I, I'm not buying this for a second.  Just tell the second.  What else did you do next?  Did you rip the toenail off your dying grandmother and fuck that little, like, soft bleeding top  of toe skin?  Truth is stranger than fiction.  Yes, it is.  But your call is more boring than paint.  And your blood should be more tainted than, I can't think of a good comparison because  I'm scared.  Let's go to Candice in, uh, Vegas. 
[02:57:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, girl!  Hey, girl!  Ah!  I have used my cell phone.  Your cell phone?  I am a vibrator, like, I love my vibrator.  I use it all the time and I ran out of batteries so I used my cell phone.  How did you get it to keep vibrating on you?  I had to keep going and pushing the, uh, ringtone thing to get it to keep vibrating.  1,500 and roaming charges because you're all whore.  Yeah, but that's my story. 
[02:57:30]  Who's this hour-long call to cunt?  Remember the time we tried to get a cell phone to ring inside?  Yes.  Fell miserably.  We tried to see if a cell phone would ring inside a woman's vagina.  Yeah?  And this is back before they were really small.  Oh, yeah.  We had to find a real slot.  The thing was, like, one of those StarTac, like, the first one.  One of those big, those big phones.  Michael Douglas had in Wall Street.  Yeah, we've talked about that. 
[02:58:00]  That's what's great about watching those old movies, to see the dumb technology that's  so old now.  Wow, look, he's talking on the beach with a phone.  With a phone as big as a shoe.  He's calling it an airstrike in World War II.  Yeah.  I had a girl who went on a show.  She says she used the back of a Sonic Care toothbrush.  Oh, yeah.  Right there on the button.  Hold on.  So, um, in 2001, a Space Odyssey, they had, like, kind of, like, flat screens.  I think they had a better idea of where technology would be at Kubrick, yeah.  Yeah, I haven't seen that in a while.  Let's go to Theo.  Let's check that out.  Theo?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Uh, when I was, like, 12 or 13, I was at my grandma's, and I would use a butter-flavored 
[02:58:30]  Crisco from her kitchen.  And then she was doing my laundry, and she's like, why do all your clothes smell like butter?  So I had to cut it up.  Oh, almost caught you.  What did you, what did you just use it as lube and use your hand?  Right, right.  Watching, like, USA Up all night with Rhonda Shearer and all that stuff.  Oh, remember Rhonda Shearer?  Yeah, there was, like, a butter spot on the couch.  There was a butter spot on the carpet on my clothes.  I'm, like, butter.  Everything was greasy.  Butter.  It was awful.  Yeah.  Butterfucker. 
[02:59:00]  All right, we got to cut you short, because we got another girl on the phone.  Maggie in Florida.  What's up, Maggie?  It's Maddie.  But, um, I had a story about what I used to do.  Okay.  Um, a couple things.  And, um, I used to lay in the bottom of the tub and let the water run on me.  From the shower?  No, from the, the font.  Oh, from the spigot?  Yeah.  From the bathtub?  What would you, like, put your legs against the wall?  Yeah.  Yeah, I used to scoot down the bottom of the tub. 
[02:59:30]  Um, I had a raggedy and all that was, like, life-size.  I used to hump it.  Um, hump pillows.  Um, bunch of blankets, things like that.  But if you know, if you go down the women's aisle in, in the grocery store, that's why  everything's shaped like a dildo.  Hmm.  Tickle?  Deodorant?  Uh, well, not the deodorant, but, like, uh, hairbrushes, things like that.  I mean, they're, they all have that shape to them, um, shampoo bottles, things like that.  Ah, just in case.  Yeah, just in case.  Very nice.  But, yeah. 
[03:00:00]  It was this girl, Jolie.  This girl, Jolie, in, uh, in school.  And she would go into class, every class, sit on her foot and rock back and forth.  Right in the middle of class.  It was, like, just like, alright, she's fucking just getting off on her heel.  On her toe or heel?  It was like her heel, yeah.  She would put her heel there and sit on it and just rock herself back and forth right  in the middle of class.  Nice.  You're like, what the fuck is she doing?  Let's say hi to Michelle in New York.  Michelle?  Michelle. 
[03:00:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  When I was about, like, nine, when I first discovered masturbation, I had this four-foot,  like, tall stuffed Smurf.  I would drag it into my closet, stick it on its face, and rub one out on its tail.  Oh, that's great.  Hey, Smurf fucker.  That's great.  It wasn't Papa Smurf, so it's not pedophilia, right?  That's right.  That's right.  And I also used to go in the bathroom, kind of like Bob Kelly, and I, like, get on the  corner. 
[03:01:00]  It was the perfect height, and I would just rub one out on the corner of the sink in the  bathroom.  Just kind of moving yourself?  Nothing else would move?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, just kind of, like, gyrating on the corner of the bathroom sink.  Because I also heard some women would, like, throw a pair of sneakers in the dryer and then  lean up against the corner of the dryer with the uneven load and let it vibrate and shake  like that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you get really creative. 
[03:01:30]  I would do pillows and everything I could to, at a young age, too, man.  I just was really into it.  How young?  Uh, like, starting at nine.  Yeah, that's when you get the first little sparkle.  First little tingle down between your young, your young calf-like legs.  Find out what it's all about.  Fucking a smurf.  Have a good one.  And the smurf's probably like, hey, stupid, turn me over.  This could be a little better. 
[03:02:00]  This polack is humping my tail.  That's not my tail.  Well, it's going to dug out Doug.  I was fortunate enough to lose my virginity at 13, but I don't know if that was good or  a curse, because I couldn't replicate the action.  Kind of like how Anthony was talking about, you have to experiment until you get it right.  Yeah.  My first idea of jerking off was actually just holding my cock, spitting into my hand and  rubbing the top.  And I actually ripped the hole open a little bit more on one occasion, and I had to stop 
[03:02:30]  doing that.  Then I figured, okay, I've got to find something that's nice and round that I've got to fuck  into.  So the only thing I could find was the old-school metal Electrolux vacuum tubes, of which I  greased up with some, like, Juergen's hand lotion.  I shoved my cock into that, and those things are welded on the inside.  Oh, wow.  I got myself a nice little slice down the shaft of my cock. 
[03:03:00]  Now, it's like, I'm 14 years old at this point in time.  Scared shit, and I don't know if it's going to fix itself.  And, like, you can't go to, like, your mother and be like, yeah, hey, and it's...  Cut my cock on the back of your mom.  Yeah.  So then, you know, I actually figured out the jacking motion.  So I figured, like you were saying before, you've got to now take your hand out of it.  That's it.  So I hollowed out a Nerf ball, and I filled that up with Vaseline, and I was fucking into  that for a while.  A lot of guys fuck Nerf footballs.  That was really good. 
[03:03:30]  A lot of guys fucking the Nerf footballs back in the day.  I used the boomerang.  What Nerf?  Oh, boomerang.  Nerf boomerang.  Anything Nerf would have worked.  Oh, I'm sorry, Doug.  I didn't mean to do that.  Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  I'm a medic in the city a few years ago, opening up the west side.  This 16-year-old kid was fucking a wide-mouth Budweiser bottle.  And the problem was, kind of like what Ralphie was saying before, the kid wound up chafing  it up and blistering it so bad that even when it got soft, it swelled up and he couldn't 
[03:04:00]  get it out of the bottle.  They had to call 911 to take him over.  Ah, screw that.  I'm breaking the bottle.  Oh, that's taking a big chance.  I don't care, man.  It was a plastic bottle, so he really, you know, just cutting it, that was his only option.  And the kid just freaked out.  So they wound up having to take him over and they wound up having to basically just pull  it out.  They lubed it up and just pulled it out.  I would have got myself out of the bottle.  I don't care if it would have taken all day.  Exactly.  Hey, one more for you.  A few years ago, there was a crew working in Queens. 
[03:04:30]  And it was an overnight shift, so they're kind of just sleeping on the street corner.  The guy driving says, all of a sudden, he hears a noise and he wakes up and his partner  is jacking it next to him.  That's pretty embarrassing.  The guy's famous in Queens now.  No one would ever want to work with him now, unless they didn't know who he was.  Yeah, right on.  I never, never got caught either.  For all the jacking, and I was jacking.  Yeah, as a kid, though, you're...  Never got caught.  You're good at not getting caught. 
[03:05:00]  Never got walked in on.  Never like that.  Uh...  You ever walked in on anybody?  No.  Really?  What's so funny there, Than?  Nothing.  Come on, Steve.  You have.  What is it?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, Than got caught?  Get out of my...  Yeah, that's got it.  Yeah, you can't leave it there.  That's...  Because it was such a horror to me to get caught that I would make sure that wasn't going to  happen.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  Because Travis...  We, uh, we discussed...  Travis, what?  Well, we discussed this on part of the, uh, the Than and Sam show that we were...  Oh, we're ripping you off.  Hoo-hoo.  So, he already knows this story, which is why he said, do you have a comment?  And I laughed.  Ah.  Because I do.  Um...  Yeah, actually, uh, in college, my, uh...  Oh, boy.  Roommate?  No, my girlfriend.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Caught you or...  What are you doing? 
[03:06:00]  Masturbating.  How'd she catch you?  Uh, I guess I hadn't locked the door.  She woke up and rolled over?  Doesn't anyone fucking knock anymore?  Well, yeah, but is that embarrassing if your girlfriend catches you?  Life's the same.  Yeah.  Moving in stereo.  Because she...  Hi, Sam.  She, uh...  Yeah.  Here's the girlfriend now.  All right.  You have something to add?  Yeah.  Stan didn't mention that his girlfriend didn't allow him to masturbate. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  You know I've always wanted you, Brad.  Yeah.  So you were jacking and she walked in?  Yeah, and she had said she didn't want me to do that anymore.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Because she was an over-controlling psychopath.  Yeah, right.  And she, uh, caught you.  And she, uh, she caught me and, um...  Yeah.  Did she break up with you?  No.  She was all...  She was all talk.  Ah.  Did you get to finish up, or...? 
[03:07:00]  No, there was kind of an hour-long fight after that.  Ah.  God.  Blue balls.  She just stuck in her mouth.  Yeah.  Ah.  Tell her to go to the dining hall.  You're busy.  Yeah, go buy some books.  Let's go to Fatso from Whack Bag.  Fatso, what's up?  Good morning, bo-bo-bo-boy.  What's up, Fatso?  Warm, raw chicken skin and Astroglide.  You'll never put up with a woman's shit again.  Astroglide sucks.  Warm...  Wait, but chicken skin.  Chicken skin.  Dude, don't ever do that, dude. 
[03:07:30]  A buddy of mine...  You just gotta avoid the salmonella in your cock hole.  Yeah, that's what happened to him.  A buddy of mine fucked a turkey.  And God, I swear to God, the skin between the turkey and the leg right there.  And he got salmonella in his dick.  Oh, man.  There's no way I even...  And like I said, I was crazy, but there's no way I was fucking food.  No.  There's no way you're fucking food.  Can't pass a KFC without getting a boner.  Oh.  Ugh.  Maybe a fruit or a vegetable I would have fucked. 
[03:08:00]  But, uh...  Any vegetables given?  What did you think...  Richard or Karen Ann Quinlan.  What did Fred Durst teach us back in the day?  Uh, the cantaloupe.  Was it a cantaloupe?  Yeah, it was a cantaloupe.  We had one of the first interviews with Fred Durst, because we were one of two stations  playing Limp Bizkit at the time.  And he hung out with us, and we were talking about all this stuff on the show.  He said, take a cantaloupe.  Yeah, you cut a hole in it, about the size your dick's gonna be when it's hard. 
[03:08:30]  You put it in the microwave, and microwave it just a couple of seconds.  And then, uh, do that.  And it'll be warm, and moist, and tight.  My buddy Doug, he said on Ecstasy, he fucked a watermelon.  Hmm.  He bored it out.  That's a little odd.  Fucked a watermelon.  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to Jim in West Palm.  Jim?  Cold.  And then the pits.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Jim.  I didn't ask you, it was seedless.  That's funny.  Hey, what's going on? 
[03:09:00]  Uh, you know how, like, when you're a kid, and your parents aren't home, you, like, scour  the house trying to find your dad's porn?  Yes.  Yeah, that was another thing, yeah.  Okay.  Yep.  Well, so what I did is, one day I cut school, I was home.  My father had one of these reel-to-reel projectors.  And the one film that I found was a donkey fucking a chick.  So I'm sitting there whacking it.  Fucking jackpot, dude.  Yeah, you win.  As a kid, you see a sex and a freak show.  And this is what really fucked up. 
[03:09:30]  My mother, she was sick, so she came home early from work.  So here she is.  She catches me jacking off to a donkey fucking a chick, and then she thought my father was  a sick bastard because he had these movies in the house.  So, boy, I got my ass beat.  Really?  Oh.  Is that when you came?  Yeah.  Mama spanking her ass?  I was horrible, man.  I got my ass beat from my father.  He went and talked to me for about a month.  Now, was it your mom that came home, or was she actually in the video with the donkeys? 
[03:10:00]  You sick bastard, Jimmy.  Also, I'd like to be your official hurricane person down here in West Pond.  Oh, yeah.  We should have went local today because that hurricane's coming.  Yeah, I'd like to be your official hurricane correspondent.  Maybe I'll even jerk off in the middle of a hurricane videotape and send it to you.  Hurricane Ernesto?  Yeah, whatever the fuck it is.  That's what they call him.  That's it.  But anyway, I'm going to jack off in a hurricane for this show.  Wouldn't that be great?  It would be the greatest thing ever.  Jizz flying because of the wind. 
[03:10:30]  Dude, you got it, though.  Three, I'm trying to come.  And then you come and you hit someone in the key.  Well, actually, if the wind's going this way.  All right, you hit someone in, like, North Carolina.  Outer Banks.  We're here to save the turtles.  All right, boys.  Punching out.  Keep up the good work.  Please call us and whack off in a hurricane.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to videotape it, too, man.  All right, thank you.  I'll make my mother proud again.  My friend Monty is on the radio, same station. 
[03:11:00]  I know Monty.  Yeah, he's great.  Oh, I don't know Monty.  Oh, sorry.  Chris goes.  What?  Nothing.  All right.  Let's go to Fred in Indiana.  We've got to take a break.  Hey, guys.  I was 15, 13 to 14 years old, and I'd go to the bathroom and take a bath, and I'd jerk  off in the bathtub, because it was, like, the only place that I thought I had privacy.  And my mom would decide to play jokes, and we were really poor.  We had one bathroom. 
[03:11:30]  And she ripped open the curtain, and now I am full staff, just jerking it.  Poor side to death.  Lost her right away.  It was just the most embarrassing time of my life.  You got caught like psycho.  I know.  The curtain just rips open.  You know, this is a good place to stop.  Have we played my brother's blowjob story in a while?  Oh.  Have we played it?  That's a good one.  Oh, my God.  You want to talk about getting caught.  That's frightening.  Thank you, Fred.  Can we find that real fast? 
[03:12:00]  My brother Brett.  It's a bittersweet story.  Well, my brother Brett hates when we replay this, but it's just a classic.  It's too classic.  The bitter part is that he got caught.  The sweet part was that he could actually do this, who's the owner and the cook at  FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in Huntingtonville.  This will bring in the customers.  He runs an unbelievable restaurant.  It's 10 minutes long.  I don't give a shit.  Let's call it in, man.  Have we played in a while?  All right.  We haven't played in a while, so it's worth it. 
[03:12:30]  It'll be new to somebody out there.  Is New England clam chowder on the menu?  No?  I'm curious.  If you enjoy this next 10 minutes, please go to FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington.  Walk in, look at my brother, point, and start laughing.  And then hopefully order an appetizer or a drink or something, okay?  Does he have seafood there?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  His tuna's amazing.  And salmon.  Yeah, he does like a grill thing. 
[03:13:00]  I like some.  With fish and stuff.  Cheesecake was good.  That's my sister's homemade cheesecake.  Went right to my hips, but it was lovely.  All right, we'll go to break with this.  My brother, Brett, and a fine, fine story of him getting caught by my...  Maybe we shouldn't give that away, just in case you've never heard this before.  Let it roll.  Yeah, let it roll.  So, Brett, is it true that Mom caught you completely naked in front of...  Oh, negative. 
[03:13:30]  Come on, man.  Now you've got to tell the story the right way.  Fred himself.  Oh, his dad?  Yeah.  Oh, I told his mom, which makes the story much better.  Mom called me in another situation.  Oh, really?  We have yet to talk about that one, though.  Your dad caught you, though?  Took me many years to convince her that I wasn't a moe.  So I made...  Wait.  All right.  I want to know what that story is.  I forgot about that story.  That's a great one.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, no, wait, wait.  Not so much I wanted to give one.  It's kind of a wanted one. 
[03:14:00]  All right, Brett.  You can put that one together.  All right, listen, Brett, we're going to count on you for a couple stories today.  It's Brett Day.  All right, listen.  Tell Anthony the story and how it goes with Dad catching you completely naked on the couch  with the porno on.  Well, it was real dark outside.  I have this bad habit when I get drunk.  I need to take all my coals off.  I can't stand out of coals.  I mean, I get all hot and sweaty.  And when I moved back from Florida, I'd stay with my parents for a little bit.  And my dad always had a porn station, which we found out yesterday. 
[03:14:30]  Why?  Somehow we couldn't get ESPN or HBO.  It was all blocked out.  But amazingly, the porn station always came through.  Dad's always outside fixing some wire.  Now we know what it was.  Our neighbors next door are getting the Playboy bills and stuff.  Right.  We're enjoying it.  All right, so I come home really drunk.  And I got the bug eyes going where you can barely focus.  You try and keep one eye open.  All my senses are down because I'm really drunk. 
[03:15:00]  I'm trying to listen for Dottie, which is Freddie, my mother upstairs.  Listening for that one floorboard to creaking.  Oh, I got to change the channel.  So I'm really drunk.  I'm stripping my clothes off.  And you were taking care of business.  I was taking care of business.  All right, very good.  Then what happened?  What a business was.  No blood circulation, nothing going on, too much liquor in the body.  All right.  So you really had to work things.  Really, really, really.  And I'm trying to focus my eyes.  I can barely see you.  And I'm like, I think that's a naked chick.  This is great. 
[03:15:30]  This is really great.  So I guess at one point, I passed out.  Passed out from relieving the sprinkler.  And I guess an hour or so later, I hear this thump, thump, thump on my forehead.  And I look up.  And there's my father staring, leaning directly over him.  I'm like, oh, my God.  And there's a sock stuck to my forehead.  Dog hair from our collies is stuck all over the place.  It was a big mess.  And my dad's words were, wake up, put your clothes on, turn off the porn, and go to bed. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, you never want to hear your dad say that.  The newspaper is sticking to my feet.  And it was just a big, big, ugly mess.  Oh, that is embarrassing.  A week or so later, I was forced to move out of the house.  No, you weren't.  But that was for other reasons.  All right.  That is embarrassing.  You got to tell a mom's story.  That would bury me.  Go ahead.  I hope he buried himself yesterday.  It was pretty good.  Go ahead.  You were taking a bath, was it? 
[03:16:30]  I have a twin brother.  And when we were little, we were always forced to take baths together because we had to conserve  the water.  Many times, I bathed in Greg's dirty, tepid pool of filth because they didn't want to drain  the bath tub.  Wait a minute.  You had to bathe in water that was already bathed in?  Not by one person.  And there's my sister, Terry, there's Greg, there's Scott, there's Darren, there's Holly.  What are you, the Ingalls children from Little House?  Then we had to bathe our two dogs and, hey, Frank, we're not to get in there. 
[03:17:00]  So then we go in there and we're stuck in this mess.  So the water's all dirty and filthy.  It went by age, though.  So I got a nice bath.  And we couldn't really use the hot water because my father had the habit of always turn off  the boil right behind the cap.  Gotta conserve electricity.  The twins are in the tub.  Gotta conserve.  So as a favor to me, my brothers and sisters would relieve themselves in the tub, if I may. 
[03:17:30]  To make the water a little warm.  Shake the dew off their dandelion, if I may.  This is awful.  But at this time, my twin brother was feeling a little under the weather, so I was all by  myself in the tub.  Woo-hoo.  Probably third grade, maybe fourth.  Somewhere around there.  This chick, Patricia Johnson, really had my eyes.  She always looked at me.  I felt a little funny every once in a while.  All right.  Just be careful how you explain this.  Get on that dumb butt.  Nope.  All right.  Go ahead. 
[03:18:00]  Continue.  I'm in the tub.  I'm looking at the G.I.  Joe dolls on little boats and stuff.  Not interested in me anymore.  My sister's Barbie, which I snuck in a couple times.  Wasn't doing the job anymore.  So I started thinking about Patricia Johnson.  And I thought, and I thought, and before you know it, I was making a tent for a G.I.  Joe, I guess you could say.  Was this the first time?  How come I brought it?  Yeah.  How come my brothers never told me about this?  Oprah's always in the bathroom, but geez. 
[03:18:30]  Could you have been doing this?  I thought it was a big secret.  Like, no one knew.  I wanted to tell my friends, and that's down the road, and I got in trouble for that one  school for sharing my new founded friend, I guess you'd say, with everyone.  Guys, you know you can do this.  But anyway, so I'm in the tub, and I'm playing.  I've got to be more serious.  It's got to be more.  And not so much I wanted to give something, but I kind of wanted something.  And no, so you play golf, right, Anthony?  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Have you ever heard the term when you smack the ball really far, and you're like, oh,  it was a great drive, and it starts going, and it kind of curves, and they call it long  and wrong?  Right.  All right, use imagination.  So things are built up.  I'm like, you know?  This is amazing.  It was a study in range.  You were enjoying yourself, and like they say in Clerks, you wanted to see if you could...  Oh, is that what he was getting at?  Right?  Were you trying to curl yourself up like a water bug? 
[03:19:30]  I would see it, yeah.  Okay.  All right, we can figure that out.  All right, we can figure that out.  Continue.  You ever see those roly-poly bugs?  Yeah.  They roll up in a ball when you touch them?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, so you were trying to make like a water bug.  I discovered at a young age I should be a gymnast.  The way I was maneuvering things.  Wait a minute.  Were you able to?  So I have things wrapped around shower curtains.  G.I. Joe's propped behind my head, and I have extra boats, you know, Barbie dolls helping 
[03:20:00]  adjust, and before you know it, I'm like, eh, I think I'm there.  So I pushed a little hair out from you guys taking the bath and from the dogs, and I moved  the dirt, and I stick my head under the water, Bob, because I need the extra leverage, I  guess.  All right.  So your head went under the water.  So my head went under the water.  Right.  I'm doing something that I wanted, not that I wanted to give, and I guess during this  whole entire time, while my head and ears are under the water, and my mother's banging 
[03:20:30]  on the bathroom door trying to figure out if I'm okay.  And without me even realizing it, all I'm thinking is, Patricia Johnson, you're a wonderful  girl, wonderful.  A proud older brother here.  Go ahead.  So I'm just thinking about that.  My eyes are closed, and I have this big fantasy of playing on the Jungle Jams with Patricia.  We get it, dude.  Move on.  Then my eyes open up, and I'm staring at my mother out of my mouth.  I'm like, hey, Mom.  Freddy!  She goes screaming out of the bathroom. 
[03:21:00]  And they're never taking a bath by themselves again!  Fred's gay!  Storming down the stairs.  Now I'm in fourth grade.  I'm running naked through the house chasing my mom going, Mom, I just wanted one.  I didn't want to give one.  I just wanted one.  I didn't want to give it.  Every Christmas from that point, I got all the strings, and I got a G.I. Joe doll.  Here's a race car for you. 
[03:21:30]  Here's this.  Why are you always hanging around with your friend Gavin?  Why don't you date a girl for a change?  I'll try to bring you this.  To this day.  Now I'm 30 and single.  And also, you remember that one day in the bathtub, don't you?  You had to experiment, didn't you?  You had to experiment.  Whoa.  I got to give you credit for reaching.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  He seems afraid to make the attempt.  All right.  So there you have it.  My brother, Brett, everyone.  Unbelievable.  That could probably be the most embarrassing thing ever to get caught by your mother doing. 
[03:22:00]  Unless there was another guy involved.  That could be the only thing.  Well, just one time.  More embarrassing.  You've told enough for now.  Cool.  Sorry, Mom.  We're going to have to do a whole show on economics to outweigh that one.  Well, so happy birthday to my brother, Brett.  Happy birthday.  Big 3-0.  There's a Kodak moment.  Do you remember the times of your wedding? 
[03:22:30]  He's going to go home and blow out his candle.  Hopi and Anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big.  Goddamn!  They are heavily into one thing.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes.  One of you, I don't know which one, said, then you can pull out your business.  It's junk.  We're artists. 
[03:23:00]  You present it as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is.  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings?  We are publicity whorebags.  Publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  Because you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  So it's all on appearance, none on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  None on us.  Opie and Anthony Skied. 
[03:23:30]  Here we go.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da.  In studio, Ralphie May.  Yeah, baby.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  A little tired.  A little tired.  Still trying to get my energy from Saturday night.  I screwed my sleep up so bad that I've been going to sleep early, but then I can't sleep  all the way through because I'm only used to sleeping like four hours a night. 
[03:24:00]  So I go to sleep early and I wake up at about 1230.  And I don't have the energy or will to pick up the remote and start changing channels because  then you're up.  Then you've resigned yourself to the fact that I'm awake.  So what was on was Iron Eagle 3.  Oh, Chappie Sinclair.  Lou Gossett Jr.  Chappie Sinclair, of course.  And I just laid there watching this dreck, this awful piece of shit, direct-to-video crap. 
[03:24:30]  I don't know how you do it.  I couldn't get back to sleep.  I would have to either start changing the channels or try to just fall back asleep.  I was hoping.  There you go.  Yeah.  There you go.  Climb high.  Play the tape.  Shut up.  Oh, whatever.  Is this the song?  Of course it is.  One man, one goal.  One mission.  One heart.  Yeah.  What?  Dribble. 
[03:25:00]  Climb high.  Randy Rhoads on guitar, though.  And Randy Rhoads, you know what, should fucking have his remains dug up and kicked.  You looked at me.  You weren't sure.  I know.  You weren't sure.  First of all, Lou Gossett did Officer to Jail, but he won the Oscar.  And then he just sucked dick for the rest of his career.  That was it.  What happened, Lou?  Over.  I want your D-O-R mayonnaise. 
[03:25:30]  Then what?  Then what?  Fucking 18 versions of that shit Iron Eagle franchise.  What a fucking hack-awful character.  Chappy Sinclair.  Chappy.  Chappy, what do I do?  I don't know.  Suck Dax cock.  Oh, fucking enemy of mine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, enough.  Something.  Ryan has been on hold for like a half hour.  Yeah, let's get him on.  He had to sit through a blowjob story. 
[03:26:00]  Sorry.  Everything else.  Ryan.  Sorry about that.  Ryan.  What's up, guys?  We're sorry.  It was amazing to hear some real entertainment for once.  Oh, cool.  This is Ryan Starr.  He's part of Rockstar.  Yes.  They're trying to find a lead singer for Supernova, the Tommy Lee band.  Newstead.  Newstead.  Thank you, Jason Newstead.  And Gilby Clark, who I love, by the way.  Sweet.  And, of course, Tommy.  So it's going to be a four-person band, right?  Four-guy band.  Yeah, and they're down to six people, right, Ryan? 
[03:26:30]  They're down to six.  Tonight, we perform.  Tomorrow, it'll be down to five.  Hey, do you play an instrument, too, or do you just sing?  I play a bunch of instruments, actually.  But on the show, I've played piano and guitar.  Okay.  I play drums.  You know, I do it all.  I was a typical kid growing up on Long Island.  Do it all.  Yeah, what part of Long Island?  I grew up in Huntington.  What?  Oh, shit.  Trophy stuff.  And my band, we were like 15 when we got together.  We were called Stage.  And, you know, like our first show, we were 15. 
[03:27:00]  We played at the Roxy.  Remember that place?  The Roxy, of course.  I used to play there all the time.  What's his name?  Frank Cariola.  With the ear hair.  He had ear hair.  That was like the longest ear hair ever.  No, no.  He had ear moss.  It was black crap.  We totally was.  And he used to take all our money.  We'd get like $10.  We'd bring like 100 kids down.  Yeah.  You guys only brought in 10 people.  What?  The whole fucking crowd here was for us.  No, they weren't.  The best show I saw at the Roxy.  I think we've told this story many times on the air. 
[03:27:30]  But Randy Jackson, ex-lead singer.  Zebra.  Zebra.  He blew off the rest of the band.  And he was at the Roxy by himself playing every single instrument and singing at the  same time.  Remember those guys you'd see on the boardwalk that could, you know, they have this one-man  band.  Yeah, the one-man band.  Randy Jackson was trying to pull that off at the Roxy the last time I was there, which  is now.  What is it now?  It's like either a Christian.  What the hell is it?  It's like a church.  Yeah.  I think it's some kind of weird church or a Chinese buffet place. 
[03:28:00]  Hey, Ryan, what is the rumor about you got into music because you were influenced by  Rotgut?  Yeah.  That was Anthony's band on Long Island.  My band.  I think every guy had a band on Long Island.  You had to.  I could totally start talking about that as my influence.  It would be fun.  But, yeah, we started out quickly because of the Roxy.  It forced us to, like, you know, go into Manhattan and start playing clubs there.  Because we figured if we were getting ripped off, we might as well get ripped off, you  know, in style.  By the best, right.  Yeah, but those are a bunch of assholes, too. 
[03:28:30]  And then you'd walk into some of these places you never played before and, like, the crowd  just didn't fit you, your music.  There were, like, three goth people standing around.  We went through it all together.  You know, we were, like, the best of, you know, we were, like, best friends growing  up.  One of those stories.  None of us could play our instruments amazing, but we, as a band, we were kind of good, you  know.  So we stayed home.  We all went to, like, Stony Brook University.  And then Madonna signed our band to her record label.  And we made a record there. 
[03:29:00]  How'd that happen?  Like, when we started, you know, we just...  Wait, what was her label again?  Didn't she have Offspring or something like that?  No, it was Maverick Records.  Maverick Records, but...  They were biggest for signing Candlebox and Defton.  Candlebox, that's what I was thinking.  Like, how do you go from just kicking around some shitholes to, you know, getting signed?  Well, you're talking, you're talking about, you know, eight years later, we finally,  you know...  Overnight success.  I think the band, you know, New York bands, if you could stay together long enough, you'll  actually make it at one point.  Yeah, I think you're right.  So, we did that, and it's just because of the stars aligned. 
[03:29:30]  We made a record, went around the country a few times, and it just, you know, fell short  of becoming huge.  So, uh...  Were you big in Japan?  Not even big in Japan.  Maybe, like, Indonesia, but, you know, nothing enough to retire on.  So, about a year ago...  And it fucked up.  It's fucked up that you think you, like, you signed, and it's like, dude, we're touring,  this is it.  Here we go.  We fucking made it.  And then it's just another level of shit that you have to go through. 
[03:30:00]  I know a ton of musicians listening to your shit.  I know, you know, we all did, and it's the first step.  It's the first step to, like, the first day of hard work when you get to that level, because  just as many bands get signed, you know, and then 1% of those bands actually make it,  so...  You're like, why am I still humping my own equipment?  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ, who the fuck stole our hand truck?  Totally, man.  But at the end of the day, it's fun.  You know, you have the near accidents on the road, you know, in the middle of January, driving 
[03:30:30]  through the snow and all that.  But it's all good, and here I am now.  You know, I moved on from the band a year ago and started doing solo stuff in Manhattan.  Hey, wait, can I ask you something?  Is the band pissed?  You know, at first it was a shock to everybody, but we were just burnt.  The business.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got us so turned around and beat up that people just moved on.  But I still love the guys.  Peter, the bass player, who's a huge fan of, you know, you may excuse me, make us listen  to your show.  Cool.  He's actually doing my website now.  So it's like, you know, we're still a close family. 
[03:31:00]  Well, that's cool to hear.  It gets to you after a while.  Totally.  It's funny that you brought up that whole thing of driving and the horror stories on the road,  because there's one time we were driving back from some place, Augie's Checkered Flag  Lounge in Kingston, and we were driving back from there, and my brother was driving, and  he's fucking falling asleep.  And I'm sitting in the passenger seat looking at him.  He wasn't trying to suck his own dick?  Yeah.  He might have been.  So I'm like hitting him going, wake up.  And I go, fuck this.  Let me drive. 
[03:31:30]  His logic was, look, I know I'm not going to fall asleep.  I don't know you're not going to fall asleep.  That was the type of stupid logic that almost got us killed 80 times on the road.  The guy would insist on driving, and you know, you get these guys, they insist on driving  when they are falling asleep.  Yeah, that's the worst.  When the head's bobbling, and you're just like, I'm fine, I'm fine.  Yeah.  You know, you get so stubborn at that point.  Then you've got to wait for him to actually fall asleep to prove your point.  You've got to wait for him.  Like, all right, I'm going to let him fall asleep and hit those things. 
[03:32:00]  I've been there, man.  We got hit by, the worst night we had was, it was, we got hit by a double tractor trailer  truck, like missed us, you know, like throwing us off the whole road completely.  And there was one night in the Midwest.  That was terrific.  We were in Colorado, and it was so icy on the road, we actually had to stop.  But it was pitch black, so you don't want to stop too much.  You don't want to be implanted to you.  So we're stopping the van, and the wind is so strong, it's actually blowing us off of 
[03:32:30]  the road, and it blew us into a ditch.  So it's like, you couldn't even stop, because you're basically ice skating on this road.  Yeah, we made it, man.  We're fucking rock stars.  Let's ride a song.  Then you turn around, your trailer's missing, and everything you've ever owned and all your  guitar is missing.  Gone forever.  Great.  Pretty much the story.  Hey, whose trailer did we help find, but unfortunately there was nothing left?  Oh, it was empty.  Shit, yeah, that was up in Boston.  Those guys were huge, too, man.  Oh, it was Douchebag's Band. 
[03:33:00]  Douchebag's Band.  Who's now the Christian guy that everyone hates.  Creed?  Yeah.  There you go.  Creed.  Creed came in to play a show.  This is a quick story.  Creed comes in to play a show for WAF, right?  It was a great show.  It was at a small place.  It was before Creed really blew up.  And then we're doing our afternoon drive show the next day up there in Worcester, and they  called us to beg us to help them find their trailer.  Gave a description and everything.  Because what's-his-name had these really cool vintage guitars or antique guitars or some 
[03:33:30]  very special guitars.  So we put out, you know, the word to everybody, and they found it in the ghetto, completely  empty.  And they were so freaking bummed out.  That's fun.  That's the worst, man.  Well, is that what's going on with him now?  I mean, we've been sequestered here.  I'm in a Hollywood mansion for a few months now with no idea what's going on in the real  world.  Is he known as the Christian rock guy now, completely?  Well, I think he went Christian.  Well, he always did his Christian thing, though. 
[03:34:00]  Did he?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just have to keep track.  Well, they really got you locked up, though, huh?  They do, man.  Listening to that five minutes I was on hold, it was like, just feel like I felt like I  was at home.  It was beautiful.  Oh, that's cool.  I haven't heard real people talk in a long time.  That's kind of how I get put it.  You still live out here?  Yeah.  I live a lot of Manhattan now.  I'm back and forth from the island in Manhattan.  I miss the summer there.  But, you know, for this summer, I'm in this incredible 200-year-old mansion to see the 
[03:34:30]  show.  I mean, it's all over the show.  I've been hanging with Tommy Lee and all these crazy, crazy kids that I'm in the house with.  Yeah, I've checked out the show.  It's all right, man.  You're one of six finalists.  I've got to read something from your bio, Ryan.  Just keep in mind, I don't write this thing, all right?  I know.  But maybe you haven't been sent this one.  There's a nice douche chill in here.  Ryan Starr is a charmer, winking, rocking, all-American flirt who will make hearts melt 
[03:35:00]  worlds over.  He has something in his eye, winking, but he's also one hell of a rock musician with a wonderful  ear, a rich voice, and a good sense of himself within the crazy world of rock and roll.  That crazy world.  That sounds like something they would write.  I wear contacts.  Maybe I have a piece of dust in my eye.  He's winking.  No, I can't say.  Now I'm a throwing up musician after hearing that. 
[03:35:30]  Now, the key is to have a good sense of yourself within the crazy world of rock and roll.  That's probably like, you know, we'll write through things, publicists and stuff like this.  Probably.  There's so many people involved with this.  I mean, this is a huge production.  It's not like a little cable show.  This is the real deal.  So the amount of effort they put into the performances are incredible because, you know, I was like  the indie guy from New York.  You know, this is the last thing I would have ever done.  I almost didn't come out here.  I came out here very last minute.  And I'm glad I did now because now I'm looking at the show. 
[03:36:00]  I'm like, you know what?  It's pretty good.  Talent's strong.  There's no, like, real cheese balls on it where I'm, like, embarrassed to be on a show.  And we're playing rock music on TV.  I mean, I don't remember that being done when I was growing up.  You know, I never, you know, besides MTV, you couldn't get, you know, a decent rock show.  So we're doing that.  But as far as, yeah, you also have the other side of things where they write that you're a winking, you know,  charmer or whatever that means because I'm definitely not.  Ryan.  I was called the same thing, but it was blinking rapist.  Maybe that's what they meant.  Ryan, hear me now. 
[03:36:30]  You're going to win the whole thing.  I'll tell you why.  Why is it?  There's six finalists left.  Two of them are chicks.  So goodbye to the chicks.  Tommy Lee is not going to have a chick lead singer.  Yeah.  Jason Newstead is not going to have a chick lead singer.  Gilby, maybe.  Maybe.  So then you're down to the, you know, the four finalists.  Sure.  And then.  I mean, you know, it's interesting.  In the first episode, they said, we're looking for an all-American rock and roll band. 
[03:37:00]  Right.  And I am the only American guy left on the show.  Yeah, there you go.  Like, when they did this with NXS, we talked to these guys.  We're like, no way are you, you know, replacing Michael Hutchins with a chick.  No way.  And they're like, no, we had an open mind about it.  We thought, no, you didn't.  The chicks are there to make the show, you know, a little cooler and get more people watching and stuff.  But in the end, they're not going to pick a chick.  They're definitely making it more dramatic.  I don't know if you've tuned in, but the drama, the guys, we're all cool now.  We're tight.  There's four of us left.  Iceland, Australia, Canada, and the U.S., myself. 
[03:37:30]  We play basketball every day.  We play ping pong.  You know, we do guy things.  We hang out just to try to clear our heads.  The girls, you know, are here stirring up drama, stirring up, you know, they're talking crap about each other.  And, you know, it's enough to fuel the TV land.  You know, they give the fuel for the TV, so they're necessary for the entertainment value.  But we're just like, come on, this is just, let's play the show, you know, let's rock at it.  I can't imagine a band, though, giving that, the lead singer to a girl.  Oh, that period you got to deal with, that fucking swollen tits. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, you're awful.  Well, I got to say, if you've seen the show, these girls definitely, definitely have, I would say they have balls.  They're like scary, they're scary rock chicks.  No, Storm's a firecracker.  Yeah, like scary rock chick, though, where, you know, they're very intimidating.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, they're not girls you're going to, like, take out for dinner in a movie.  No.  They're like dudes, you know.  Meet your parents, you know, she's blowing your father. 
[03:38:30]  You're going to like a girl like that.  Yeah, sure.  Now that I think about it, that is a good gal.  I did once, it was my mother.  Sorry, why did I say that?  I don't know.  Because you're Jimmy Norton.  All right, Ryan, what's the big plug?  It's on tonight, right?  Yeah, the plug, let's see.  It's on tonight.  This is actually Fan Song Selection Week, so they're big on the whole MSN website thing,  right?  So the fans went on and they basically chose what songs we're going to sing this week.  Oh, do you know what it is?  Of course you do.  Yeah, I'm going to be doing a song called Clocks by Coldplay, which I passed up on doing 
[03:39:00]  a few weeks ago, which is great that I get to do it tonight.  Have you done Nirvana yet?  You know what, that's just sacrilegious to me.  I stick away from that.  They do Nirvana on the show every week if somebody does it, and sometimes it comes  out great, but for me, I grew up on that stuff, and I can't.  What would be your ideal song to sing that you would think would show, you know, here's  my shit?  I've been trying my hardest since day one here to get them to release Head Like a Hole by  Nine Inch Nails. 
[03:39:30]  Ah, that would be sweet.  And I would love to kill that song.  I do a great version of it, just completely stripped down on the acoustic, and they just  won't do it.  Trent Reznor's just like, you know, he won't even humor the idea of being on TV.  Wow.  Why?  He didn't mind Hurt being done by Johnny Cash, right?  I mean, there's a big difference between Johnny Cash doing it and potentially, you know, some  loser doing it on a TV show.  You just know, they don't know how it's going to come out.  Okay.  Man, they're so full of themselves.  Just let the kid do it.  I know.  Yeah, totally. 
[03:40:00]  That would be an ideal song.  Please.  And, yeah, it's not going to happen, but tonight you'll get to see Clocks, and just, you know,  the voting is getting stiff, so I don't know who the hell, you know, votes out there, but  if you do, give it a few more clicks tonight, because I could use the help, and, you know,  for New York, for Long Island, let's do it.  Definitely.  All right.  Good luck, Riley.  Good luck to you.  For having me, guys.  Awesome.  It's on tonight.  As we go to break here, we're going to play you doing Losing My Religion acoustically.  We're on the piano, right?  Yeah, that was actually, that was a great night for me, man. 
[03:40:30]  That's kind of what I've been doing in Manhattan.  That's more my solo sound.  All right.  We'll check it out.  We'll check it out.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  Good luck to you, Ryan.  And Brooke Burke, you don't even, you know, you know Brooke Burke's on the show, right?  You should mention that.  I've got to be honest with you.  She's hot as shit, but she's just, she's just.  She's just.  No, man.  And she smells really good.  We get all that, but as far as a host, she's lucky Dave Navarro's there.  I've got to say it.  She's great to look at. 
[03:41:00]  Trust me.  Yeah, she is.  But as far as a personality, oh my God.  Let's stop reading the cue cards and get a little bit excited.  Oh my God, I can.  See, I'm watching the show, Ryan.  It's awesome.  You know, Dave Navarro's the reason I'm here still.  He's the reason I even came out on the show.  He's got an unbelievable personality.  He really carries that whole show.  He really does.  He's amazing.  It wouldn't be anything without him.  And Brooke is hot.  Just.  She's some nice.  She's nice eye candy.  All right, Ryan.  Yo, thanks for having me. 
[03:41:30]  Have fun out there.  Good luck, bro.  Ryan Starr.  Later, man.  Bye.  And here it is doing Losing My Religion.  Long Island, boy.  Just a piece.  Oh, life is bigger, it's bigger than yours.  You are not me.  The lengths that I would go to.  The distance in your eyes. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, no, I've said too much.  I haven't said it all.  That's me in the corner.  That's me in the spotlight.  Losing my religion, yeah.  Trying to keep up with you.  And I don't know if I can do it. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, no, I've said so much.  I haven't said it all.  I thought that I heard you laughing.  I thought that I heard you sing.  Oh, no, I think I thought I saw you sing.  Oh, no, that was just a dream. 
[03:43:00]  To try, cry, cry, cry, try.  That was just a dream.  Just a dream.  Just a dream.  Just a dream.  I just ate four burritos and drank a pot of coffee.  Anyone for trouser chili?  Oh, God damn.  The O.D. and Anthony Show. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  No bonus show today.  We got things to do.  Yes.  Every day we got things to do. 
[03:44:00]  Every goddamn day there's shit to do now, right?  We got interviews for the Philly newspapers.  When's that?  For the O&A traveling virus.  And that later?  September 9th in Camden at the Tweeter Center.  Lawn tickets are on sale as we speak for $10 freaking dollars.  All the info is up on opianthony.com.  I sat down and I took a leak.  There must have been a drop in there.  When I sat down, it went and then rolled out my helmet into my boxers.  Oh, I hate that.  See, that's what the boxers, that's what the fucking boxers do. 
[03:44:30]  Well, we're going to roll down into the fucking long diaper ones, too.  I mean, just.  No, the regular cotton briefs.  Ew.  If there's a single drop, it will soak that up.  I don't need to soak up.  You've got to soak up all the blood and brains and all that and get it all soaked up.  Boxer briefs.  Bring in the wolf.  Yeah, I think they're awful.  Bring in the wolfers underwear.  I want to put.  I want to take you in your boxer briefs and I want to fuck you in the ass with them on.  Wow.  Like, I want to just push it all the way in there.  So it's cotton up my ass? 
[03:45:00]  It won't be gay because it'll be cotton between us.  Between us.  Sure.  We're leaving at 11 because we've got to go get dressed.  What kind of outfits are you guys going to get?  Now, you're getting dressed.  We're thinking of getting exactly matching John Carr outfits.  Outfits.  Absolutely.  Where our belts are up to our nipples and then everyone can just goof on us and call us hacks  and say how horrible it was that we did that. 
[03:45:30]  We already did that for our TV commercial.  Yeah, I know.  We can't dress the same again.  All we had to do was pull up those pants a little bit.  I know.  And we had the John Carr look.  The whole look.  By the way, what's the thing with the networks now refusing to spot?  Is that true?  The version where I say you're huge ass.  Why would they refuse that?  Because it says ass.  Ew.  What's the...  Babies.  So we have to go with the alternate ending.  The alternate.  It isn't the dress.  Which isn't nearly as good.  What was the alternate? 
[03:46:00]  It isn't the dress.  The alternate says it's the girl.  You know, she goes, I don't know.  Does this dress make me look fat?  And we go, no, no, no.  And Opie kind of looks at her and goes, it isn't the dress.  That's just as good as saying it.  No, it's your huge ass that makes you look fat.  How about they just beep it?  It's your fat...  It's your huge ass, yeah.  They should do a version where they just beep the word ass.  Everybody knows what you said.  The huge beep, like you've been censored.  Yeah. 
[03:46:30]  That's the way to do it.  But people might think I'm saying huge cunt.  Big deal.  It's a really huge cunt just because she's a woman.  No offense, ladies.  No offense.  No offense, ladies.  I would talk to them about that.  How about your big, huge beep?  That's Anthony.  They belong on the radio.  There might be something there where you can't do TV.  You get beeped.  That was the weirdest thing to do because they casted a fat chick.  For the fat role.  I know.  And you have to tell her how fat she is.  That's perfect.  That is so weird, though.  You should have told her off air, too, like at craft services.  You know that most girls that were fat, they walked out of the audition because they found 
[03:47:00]  out it was for us.  Yeah, it was for us.  It was for us.  She was a good egg.  And she was very pretty.  Actresses said no.  Fat actresses said no because it was an Opie and Anthony commercial.  Yeah.  No, no.  That's how pathetic we are.  That's how pathetic we are, too.  No, well, here's what the thing is.  You non-working fat twats.  I would love to get the names of those fucking fat bitches and go over their resumes and see  what they've done.  Yeah.  You fucking manatees.  Just do the commercial.  Well, all the versions are up on YouTube.  The Opie and Anthony TV commercial. 
[03:47:30]  The one I suggested, which was that there's a radio and your voices are coming out and  you guys are brutalizing a woman in rapier.  Is that good?  By the way.  I like it.  By the way.  That's something.  They put together a, I don't know, like a three-minute behind-the-scenes blooper type  thing.  A couple little outtakes.  And that is now up on opandandth.com, the outtakes and stuff.  A couple little outtakes.  Also on YouTube.  Once again, I love the YouTube. 
[03:48:00]  I can't stop talking about YouTube.  We have like five or six hundred videos now up on YouTube.  Everything is up there and more videos being edited every day.  So much shit on there, too, though.  I know.  That's the problem.  You just go to something and you click on it and go, why is this even?  Why does this exist?  Yeah.  Well, for example, if you throw our names in the search, Opie and Anthony, not only is  there a lot of shit, you know, I just said five or six hundred videos.  There is a lot of them that are like, who cares?  And then there's the same video like ten or twenty times.  Yeah. 
[03:48:30]  There's a video of people like walking down a sidewalk talking and then it just ends.  And you go, what the fuck is that wasting bandwidth for?  Well, that's going to be the next stage as far as YouTube and these other sites where  they're going to have to filter the crap out of them.  See, the weird thing is, like, I had the same problem because I shot a commercial recently  and I had a problem with the Disney people wanted certain things taken out.  And I said, well, we can't do that.  And I said, yes, you can.  Oh.  Or I wouldn't do it.  And what was it, Jimmy?  A tranny. 
[03:49:00]  Look at you demanding.  Yes.  From my Amherstine show.  It'll only be shown in New York.  And you demanded it?  I wouldn't have done it without a tranny.  They tried to give me the fucking alternate version.  No.  I couldn't do it.  Because they wanted me to do one without her.  Was that in the commercial or just your pay?  No.  No, they go, could you do one for safety?  That's the word they used.  Ah, yeah.  For safety.  I'm like.  We were too stupid to understand that.  For safety means we're not using the one you want to use.  We're using this.  She goes, just in case.  I'm like, with the language that I can almost understand, the word ass, they kind of have 
[03:49:30]  to because that's a network thing.  It's like the word ass, that could go away.  This was not anything that would get censored.  This was a tranny going, hi, daddy.  And this was me in a robe and another tranny.  I had her kiss me on the cheek.  And they go, well, could you do one without it?  And I'm like, no.  No.  It has to be in every.  Because there's nothing offensive about that word.  I'm like, why wouldn't the network show that?  And that would be the one they would use.  Yeah, of course it would be.  Hey, really fast.  Billy Dee from Pittsburgh.  You know. 
[03:50:00]  Get him, Opie.  Get him.  We got to call these guys out.  Got nothing for the XM show today.  Huh, gents?  Yuck.  Nice interview.  Stinks.  Stinks phoned it in.  Howard phoned it in.  Did he say gents?  Did he really say gents?  Like he's Adam Baldwin, Alec Baldwin.  Billy Dee from Pittsburgh.  All right, so you didn't like the interview.  Fine.  But that doesn't mean the whole show sucked, you asshole.  The whole show?  We were laughing our asses off.  Yeah, what do you want?  Billy Dee from Pittsburgh.  You're a fucking dumb name. 
[03:50:30]  So anyway, we're leaving at 11 because we've got to get...  That's right.  We're phoning it in.  Because Billy Dee is telling us to leave.  We've got to get dressed for our Letterman appearance.  We're going to try on some outfits.  Why don't you guys just try out in fucking sundresses?  But don't acknowledge it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just go right to the ladies section.  That's cute.  So don't forget Letterman this Thursday night.  Okay, we could do this man holds girl hostage in Dungeon for eight years.  This is a big story today.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, overseas.  This is in Germany.  Oh, they're into that freaky shit. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, some freaky shit.  Fucking chickens and stuff.  Dirty Nazis.  Yeah, that's chicken good.  Having dogs lick their fucking pooches.  What's that, sweetie?  Keep pointing out what we're doing wrong and we'll never get to material.  What did we do now?  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, shit dicks.  Hey.  Listen, I've got a new entry and I could call every day for the Opie to English Dictionary.  Oh, no.  Opie to English.  We've already done this bit, by the way.  Today, it's casted a fat chick.  They didn't casted a fat chick. 
[03:51:30]  Are they cast a fat chick?  That's a common mistake, sir.  Maybe they threw her out.  Well, here's a better one.  I drive the English teachers nuts.  They're driving to work to their miserable fucking teaching job.  Like, this guy's in broadcasting?  Yeah, they get so pissed off.  I know it's cast.  I said casted.  Okay, great.  Shoot me.  Yeah, but here's a worse example.  Oh.  You say, yeah, we broadcasted from there.  You're a broadcaster.  You didn't broadcast it.  You broadcast from someplace.  But it doesn't fucking matter. 
[03:52:00]  Most people don't even give a shit.  Like you're saying.  Why are you being so cunty, dude?  Yeah.  You are being.  That's the real question.  I say we broadcasted from somewhere.  I've been doing that for years.  I'm not going to change now for you.  Does that take away from the program, really?  I'm not going to tell you, sir.  It's kind of.  Oh, no.  You're the hole.  Sir.  You just became the fucking hole of this show.  I didn't even notice either one of those, to be honest with you.  And I pick up on English.  You know that I should have been a doctor or a scientist?  Or a model. 
[03:52:30]  Or a model, yes.  Thank you, Jimmy, for pointing that out.  My model years are way behind me now.  I don't know about that.  I still think you could at least do body modeling.  But, you know, in high school, you do the SATs and all those tests and stuff.  I wasn't supposed to go into broadcasting.  They told me not to.  Really?  My English skills sucked.  My SATs, the English part was like, I don't know, like 300 or something ridiculous.  And my math was well over like 700.  I should have been a scientist or a doctor or something. 
[03:53:00]  I said, fuck that.  That's boring.  I'm going to try this English thing.  Imagine Dr. Ropey walking in to operate on you.  I knew when I was in high school that my English sucked.  So what are you telling me today, Tom?  Well, that would be scary, though, if you knew all about medicine, though, but didn't have the English thing.  Nobody wants that.  Dr. Hughes, look, we founded something.  Actually, we founded something.  We're going to have to operate it on you.  Actually, if I'm not mistaken, my English was like SATs.  I think it was like 420.  That's it.  It was awful.  And then math was over 600. 
[03:53:30]  Mel Brooks.  That's Paul Simon.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What, is he wearing dryer lint on his head?  What the fuck is that?  All right, Tom, thanks for making me look like a douche today in front of America.  He's got a new act that calls everyone hockey puck.  What is Paul Simon's head?  What happened to it?  What, is he doing a benefit for nuclear reactor survivors?  Oh, my God.  He's got a cotton candy wig.  It's really awful.  It's 50 ways to leave your lover.  How many ways to not wear a hat when you need one? 
[03:54:00]  Motherfucker.  50 ways to lose your hair.  You can comb it over.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Rip it out by the fistful, Jack.  All right, what?  What, sir?  I was just going to say, Opie, you're amazing that you've overcome this incredible...  No, I know I haven't overcome it.  I, you know, I do...  Oh, no, no, you've overcome it because you're successful and you're a millionaire.  Yeah.  What kind of TV did you get?  I was one of these math whizzes growing up, and I was just bored with it.  Who cares?  I was that dope that was, like, in seventh, eighth grade taking high school math and all 
[03:54:30]  that crap.  Sure, it's all for fun.  I was that guy.  And then somewhere along the line, I just couldn't do the math anymore.  I was bored with it.  Yeah.  And then I think I almost failed, like, math my senior year.  Could have been, like, some idiot like Bill Gates.  I just couldn't...  Yeah, I probably...  Who knows?  I had math skills, but it just bored the shit out of me.  Well, listen, rather than come up with any other words, I'll just chime in from yesterday  and say that I also hate that John Mayer.  That guy...  Really? 
[03:55:00]  Why?  I like John Mayer.  I kind of like John Mayer.  I love him.  I hate him.  Now this guy, I finally found something I like about him.  What?  I thought he had a good appearance on our show.  He had a great appearance on the show.  Oh, he's funny, but his music sucks.  Dude, it's like, look, I'm a Sabbath fan.  Mid-tempo, namby-pamby bullshit.  But it's not...  I like to trash music.  And I'm not just saying this because I know John, because I've heard his stuff before I  knew him.  It's just...  It's like, if it's not your style of music, you can't say he sucks.  Like, I don't like jazz.  So I don't know how to judge jazz because I don't listen to it. 
[03:55:30]  You understand?  Well, then let me attack his appearance because he looks like a giant dwarf.  Yeah.  Dude, I got it.  I would love to hear my friend trashed.  Quick, he hung up.  But I've, at the Comedy Cellar, I don't know.  Every chick in the room wants to fuck him.  Oh, dude.  Yeah.  That's another reason I hate him.  No, he's actually good with his friends.  He tries to hook you up.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  He's a selfless man.  You gotta love that, then.  He's a good boy.  I just got shushed, and that's why I'm kind of guilty.  Why did you get shushed?  I was fucking... 
[03:56:00]  By me?  No, no, no, no.  By John Mayer.  By John Mayer.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Robby's feelings are hurt.  All right.  Let's see.  You do phone it in, Jimmy.  At first, there was bonus show every day, and now there's nothing because why?  You figure the XMers have forgotten what we used to get.  Now it's shorter content with an ass load of commercials and recaps we already heard.  That's Jim G from Cleveland.  Come on.  Hey, Jim.  Jim G misspells already.  How you doing?  That's great.  Don't you know we get things to do at, like, 11?  If we didn't, we would hang out longer, but we have things to do. 
[03:56:30]  And there's more meetings and all that stuff.  Five hours y'all are doing.  Five hours of radio.  I'm too fucking...  But phoning it in is really...  Two studios.  Not true.  You're the only radio show that just walks to the next studio.  Jim G.  One day we should show them what it's like to phone it in.  No problem.  Stay home and actually call.  Yeah.  And phone it in.  And literally phone in a show from bed.  I will say, you will hear us phone it in.  When are we doing the phone it in show? 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, wow.  You motherfucker.  You'll hear me snoring.  I started something with this math thing.  Uh-oh.  Mr. Torrance.  Opie, you liar.  You're no math whiz.  Prove it.  Quick.  What's eight times nine?  That's 72.  Who is it?  And then, wait.  Where's the one that's really funny?  The Goodwill hunting one?  No.  Where is it?  Okay, now we're supposed to believe Opie is Goodwill hunting. 
[03:57:30]  You ass.  I have a question for all about math.  Let's see if you know this one.  I really suck now.  Okay.  Do you know what pi is?  Yeah.  What number?  Uh, four.  Three, three point six.  Three point one four.  Three point one four.  But it keeps going after that.  Three point four.  Three point one four.  It never ends.  One five, nine two seven.  Then after nine two seven, I think it's, uh, five?  No, and I actually, in a German conference, they changed the five to seven. 
[03:58:00]  Do you know that?  Does anybody know what pi squared is?  No.  Well, I mean, I'm sorry.  In fraction form.  No.  Well, then what's the use of having friends, like, in this room if no one knows what pi is?  What is it?  I'm not telling you.  I'm not kidding you.  My, my, you don't know it.  22 sevens.  22 over seven.  My math brain blew up years ago.  Seriously.  I can't be bothered with it anymore.  Uh, Mike, I find the area of a circle.  I don't know.  What's that you fucking ask your friend?  Pi R squared.  No, that's not it.  You run in the circle and you go, all right, well, this is how big this area is. 
[03:58:30]  And then you go and fucking find a girl and get laid and never think about that again.  The area of a circle.  Who the fuck ever needs that?  Hey, you want some pi?  Ah, what's the area of it?  I don't know.  Jerk one times asshole squared equals you.  What is it, Dr. Hughes?  A tumor?  No, ma'am.  You're just a fat pig.  Yeah.  Take these poker chips and call me in the morning. 
[03:59:00]  There's a lot of great instant feedbacks coming in now because I shared with everybody.  Mike in New York, what's up?  Hey, you guys can phone it in for the next month for all I care.  That show Saturday was awesome.  Thanks, buddy.  Look at that.  Thank you, sir.  Man.  We got permission now.  Dave in Jersey.  Well, so good you are, Matt.  How much is your bank account, Ope?  Hey, listen.  It's got two commas.  I'll tell you that fucking much.  Fuck that last guy. 
[03:59:30]  Ope, you fucking one-liners are getting better and better every day.  Really?  And you're a very good-looking gentleman to boot.  No, you're going to say not you because that's what always happened to you.  Cotton candy wig.  Cotton candy wig.  It made me laugh.  Better than the rest of those horses that have to sit next to you.  Why do you have to insult us?  Why do you have to blow out our candles to make old candles shine brighter?  Yeah.  Because my candles have been sitting here on the floor for a long time.  Yeah, but no.  There's three candles.  How much dust is around my goddamn candle and no matches to be found? 
[04:00:00]  There's three candles.  Help me out.  You don't have to have 33 and a third of them shining brightly while 66 and two-thirds  are blown out.  Oh.  Well, you could say four candles because Ralphie's here.  So why would you have to have 75% of the candles blown out?  Can't they all shine?  I bring math right in.  I mean, I'll do math all day.  Look at this shithead.  What happened?  I'm just kidding.  Ant, bottom line is that we got more on the old show.  We pay the same and now we get less.  More ads, less talk.  Don't care what happens at 11. 
[04:00:30]  We just want more XM show.  Hey, cunt fuck.  Do you realize we used to start at 7 o'clock and go to 11?  Do you realize that?  We now start at 6 and go to after 11.  Is that the same guy?  Why is this guy still fighting this battle?  Do you understand?  The show's gotten better.  We get much better guests.  We're able to do things like the ONA traveling virus.  We used to do four hours a show.  We're now doing at least five.  You dumb fuck. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, do I hate that guy.  Well.  Banned.  I'm banning him.  He's right through his opinion.  I didn't ban anyone else.  Ban him.  I'm just going to ban you.  You've been too nice lately.  You're softening.  I am.  Banned.  Ever since you guys found you at Letterman, you've gotten soft on banning people.  There you go.  And you know something?  The people I ban, they don't even know they're banned.  It looks like their message goes through.  Never goes through.  Wow.  It just goes.  You know, I would love to get a list of all the people that have been banned that have  been sending messages for like the last six months.  And nothing gets through.  You know how awful they must be? 
[04:01:30]  I rule with an iron cock.  Pie squared is Ralphie Mae's lunch.  That's pretty funny.  That's not bad.  Sorry, Ralphie.  I didn't mean to laugh at you.  No, no.  Hey, it's a good joke.  That's Jimmy Jakes from Wack Day.  I try not to talk about your weight problem.  No, please.  I don't care.  I'm not like Bobby.  I don't get cunty about it.  Broadcasted is an acceptable word.  Wait a minute.  By the way, that other douche didn't know what he was talking about.  It's not preferred in the dictionary, but it is okay to use. 
[04:02:00]  Okay.  It's like a word for retards.  It's there.  You might want to phrase that differently.  All right.  It's not the most common usage, yet it is proper English.  As long as it's proper English, it's all that matters.  Hey, Jimmy, if you have three trannies and two dump on your chest, 
[04:02:30]  what percentage of trannies dumped on your chest?  Look, first of all, sir, it would probably be 66 and two-thirds.  Second of all, I don't ever want a tranny to dump on my chest or do anything with me.  That would be disgusting.  Shitty man dump.  Unchewed meat in it.  On an all-new house, Opie must kick a dog to cure cancer.  Turmality rules.  Sam, we got to catch him. 
[04:03:00]  Do you want to do the guy that, the hostage thing or what?  Are all those people happy with us on the phones?  If not, I say we...  No, not all of them are happy.  No.  No.  On the phones?  No.  I dare someone to not be happy calling in.  Who hope?  You got an sad one there?  No, this guy's cool.  Robert in Missouri.  Hey, man, you guys can only do a half-hour show, and you give us four and a half hours  of excellent bonus show. 
[04:03:30]  Forget what those other douchebags say, all right?  All right, thank you.  Anybody hate us?  No, man.  Only on instant feedback, where they don't have to actually talk.  Yeah, they're really douchebaggy on there, man.  They've been writing a lot of crap.  You know, Ralphie Farty, you fuck off.  Ralphie what?  They've been doing a lot of fucking fat jokes over here that are bad.  I don't mind a good fat joke, like Voss's.  He had one on TV that was like, staple your refrigerator. 
[04:04:00]  Hilarious.  Cool.  Great joke.  Like if somebody wrote in and said, dude, Ralphie, were you depressed when they demoted  you from Planet last week?  That would be a good joke.  That would be a good joke.  I'm just a moon.  Son of a bitch.  But I get actually the most positive instant feedback.  Nobody badmouths me on instant feedback ever.  No, they know better.  Because you ripped their fucking head off.  They know better.  They do know better.  Jimmy is perfect.  Almost perfect.  Anthony's a little more perfect than Jimmy. 
[04:04:30]  I'm completely loved on message boards.  I'm completely loved on instant feedback and on the phones.  At this point, I can't read instant feedback anymore, and I can't visit fan sites.  Fan sites don't bug me too hurtful.  Instant feedback I never received.  I tell you, I almost didn't come back here one time.  I did a tsunami bit that was fucking like a week after.  They hadn't collected all the bodies in from the beach, okay?  And your guys shitbag all over me.  Ugh.  Brood.  XM is censored and all rah-rah crap, and XM is just a wind-down waste time post-show. 
[04:05:00]  All right.  Well, Dave finally got it.  All right.  So, that's exactly what it is.  Hello.  Cancel XM.  Welcome to Formula.  Take care, Dave.  Let's say hi to Joe in New York.  He knows what's going on.  Joe?  Hello.  Hey, Joe.  I'm going to sum it up.  We got fucked a little when you guys made the move, but we forget the lean days.  The two and a half years are not listening to you.  That's right.  That's what it comes down to.  You put it all in perspective.  Yeah, we feel a little fucked.  A little bit.  But, what are you going to do? 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, but, sir, do you really feel fucked knowing that we're making more money?  No, I make more money than you, Jimmy.  I don't make more money than I'm doing.  Not you, dude.  First of all.  Good.  Not more money than you.  I meant more money than we were making.  Oh.  More money than you.  I'm making more money than you're making, and I wash my hands after I use the bathroom.  I'm like you in the stress factory.  Dude, what do you do for a living?  That's not your business.  First of all.  But I'm getting paid listening to you on the computer right now.  All right, so you're a pedophile.  No one said that we made more money than you.  My comparison was not to you. 
[04:06:00]  It was to mean, to go to CBS, we made more money than we were making before.  Oh, well, my comparison was to you, though, Jimmy, all right?  Don't you feel silly.  Punch it out.  Have a nice day.  All right, see?  That guy does not make more than me.  If you make it more than $45,000 a year, sir, I tip my hat to you.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's say hi to J-Dog in Cleveland.  J-Dog.  Hey, what's up?  Anthony just called a guy a cunt fuck, which is the best insult I've ever been called.  I'm happy to be a cunt fucker.  Later, boys.  Let's go to Joe in Nevada. 
[04:06:30]  Yeah, but he didn't hyphenate it.  It's one word, so it's no good.  What's up, brother?  I love Opie.  You're the best.  I don't believe it, sir.  Why can't you just love him as much as everybody, sir?  I do, I do, I do.  I want to put my feet up on his shoulders and mouth fuck him.  He's beautiful.  I don't believe it.  You do like Opie, don't you?  I fucking love Opie.  Okay.  I don't believe him.  I do.  I don't at all.  All right, should we do Man Holds Girl Hostage and Dungeons & Dragons? 
[04:07:00]  Nah, I don't feel like doing any work.  For eight years?  How much time are you left in the show?  Oh, my God, we're doing a bonus show already.  Already?  Nah.  I say we go home.  What do you think?  What do you want to do?  It's not home.  Nah.  We have things to do.  I don't.  Things.  I don't.  I go home.  I got tax shit to do.  The fucking kid pays his taxes.  I'm a good boy. 
[04:07:30]  I had to.  Before I made any money, I hadn't paid taxes in like seven years.  I had to get right with the man.  Oh, boy.  I pay every year.  Those fuckers.  You don't pay a lot of taxes when you sell weed.  Paying every three months.  I know now.  I do, too, but I always pay weird on a weird schedule.  Yeah.  I'm filing right now for 2005, although I already paid.  Right.  I really had to go back and readjust it.  What's going on?  This is bonus show.  Yeah.  Motherfuckers.  You enjoying it? 
[04:08:00]  This is a bonus show.  Cocksucker.  Stay here an hour and do this.  At least you got an hour.  At least we gave you more show.  Hollabaloo.  Hollabaloo.  This is a wind-down waste of time show.  Hollabaloo.  Don't you like it?  If they fucking hate it, and they hate me, and they hate all of us, and they suck, why  the fuck are they on this show?  That was one breath, by the way.  Okay, thank you.  Wow.  What are you pulling on your ball bag?  Hand.  No. 
[04:08:30]  Look like the little hiney-headed alien from Star Trek.  Oddly scab-free.  I have immaculate little teeny balls.  There's not a hair to be found on that lad's body.  Balls are awful.  I'm lucky semen comes out of them.  When I was on vacation, I got red bag from-  Red bag?  From body surfing and boogie boarding during a- what is it called?  The red tide?  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  You sure you didn't just fall asleep in the sand and little turtles nipped at it? 
[04:09:00]  Only my left part of my ball bag.  Ew.  Red and itchy.  What's a red tide?  It's like the jellyfish.  It's bacteria.  I don't know.  Yeah, I guess.  Ew.  Sewage, maybe.  Yeah.  And jellyfish.  This guy thinks Jimmy sucks, can't wait till he goes back to film more Lucky Louie, and  is probably the reason Ben left.  Wow.  See, there's someone that doesn't like you.  He's just lying to get a reaction.  He does like me. 
[04:09:30]  We don't know the Lucky Louie yet, bro, but thank you.  I mean, he's just trying to give a Lucky Louie plug.  That's a great show, man.  I gotta say it again.  Fucking great show.  And thank that guy for writing it.  And they ain't asking me to do a fucking guest spot.  I don't give a shit.  It's a fucking funny show.  That show's hilarious.  Hope we get more.  All right, let's get out of here.  I wanted to do this, but...  Nah!  But you kind of made me sad.  I don't want to work.  But I'm sad.  Save the Nazi story.  Wait, is there any more interesting feedback with that? 
[04:10:00]  There's a Nazi story to this?  No, she's German.  He's German.  Oh.  I'd say we do it tomorrow with our favorite people over at Free FM.  Right.  Where the good listeners are.  That's right.  Not these cruds.  Where they appreciate this shit.  Where they appreciate.  I even say appreciate.  Hi, John in Arizona.  Those cheapskates appreciate free radio.  Not like you motherfuckers.  Because you pay, you expect something.  Go fuck yourself.  That's right.  Even you who were there from the beginning with your two paltry dollars a month.  Two extra dollars. 
[04:10:30]  Take those two and shove them.  They got low expectations over there.  Makes it so much easier to do a radio show.  Thanks for your two bucks.  It got me real far in my gas tank.  Yeah.  You motherfucker.  Thanks a lot.  That'll get you a cookie.  I like when someone tells me that.  That and a buck will get you a cup of coffee.  Yeah.  By the way, speaking of less money, I'm going to try and plug this date coming up in Philadelphia.  $10 on the lawn seats.  And you can see the big pictures right there. 
[04:11:00]  And you can smoke with you without anybody harassing you.  You'll have a much better time for $10, okay?  And if you...  Wait, what do you sound like?  He sounds like something.  I don't know.  I'm trying to work it over here.  An announcer from the 40s?  Ralphie sounds like something.  I can't figure out what it is.  What are you doing?  I'm trying to plug our show.  What show?  The PNC.  The Traveling Pirate Show.  The PNC.  We did the PNC.  The Tweeter Center.  Fuck it.  I don't know which one it was.  Holy shit.  We're doing the Tweeter Center.  The Tweeter Center.  In Camden.  You're right, Steve. 
[04:11:30]  What, Steve?  No, it's just exactly what Jimmy was just talking about.  Ralphie sounds like something.  Yeah.  The reference that Jimmy just made just hit me.  And now I can't figure it out.  It's going to bug me into laughing.  Yeah, you remind me of something in your voice.  And I can't figure out what it is.  I hate Jimmy.  He stinks.  And his voice is very nasally and annoying.  That's just whatever.  You're attacking my voice.  Who wrote that?  Band.  Shit.  As long as they don't attack me.  Somebody's going to get bounced.  Oh, Kim P.  As long as they don't attack me.  Yeah, that's a girl's attempt at being like, you know, just kind of have fun with me. 
[04:12:00]  And it's like, Kim, stop.  My voice is nasally.  What am I, a Jew?  Oh, wow.  Kevin from Midnight Box.  Scientist Opie?  Wait, Scientist Opie don't know what the red tide is, douchebag.  He was being humble, sir, and so the rest of us didn't feel stupid.  He knew what the red tide was.  It's a riptide, actually.  No, riptide is when they...  Tear it.  No, that's when they drag you out to sea. 
[04:12:30]  It's when you open your detergent box.  And then the monsters eat you.  Wordplay joke.  The riptide?  There's a riptide, and then there's red tide.  Riptide takes you away from your loved ones.  And then there's a lot of crying.  It's like a cross-current, right?  And then you've got to throw flowers into the waterway.  Oh, because the undercarb rips you.  Yeah.  And then that's all you've got, so you just throw flowers.  Bally high.  You throw flowers into an ocean, and that's supposed to make you fall.  I'm a duck.  Well, this ain't good.  One minute you're waving, the next minute a fucking whale is eating your asshole 400 miles from shore. 
[04:13:00]  I finally got one.  What?  Oh, no.  I hate Anthony because everyone loves him.  I see.  It's just that they love us.  I wanted some real hate feedback, and nobody will give it to me because they just can't even muster it.  Oh, dude, don't give it to me.  Trust me, I'll get emails on my MySpace.  We hate you.  You suck.  Can I be your friend?  Thank you, MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  I don't care.  Jim's ass is supple and isn't gay, so I will never get a chance to fuck it. 
[04:13:30]  Get rid of him.  No homo.  You know, at this point, you can't get a hold of me because I don't like the haters.  I just want positive things in my life.  Positive is good.  I've shut down email accounts and everything else.  Jimmy is a no-talent, four-joke, hack comic who will be appearing this weekend at the Improv and Addison.  That's right.  That's a great one.  I'm not going to fart.  Can you hear this, though?  Wait. 
[04:14:00]  What are you doing?  Yeah, that's your ass slamming on the console.  You've got to hit your ball bag.  That's what you get in bonus show.  You've got to hit your ball bag.  That's what you get in bonus show, fuckos.  Write in some feedback about me.  That's five jokes.  Can we go home?  Dude, I've been fucking...  I've been mailing it in since 11 o'clock.  Better than calling it in.  Let's mail in a show.  That's right.  Where we actually mail it in. 
[04:14:30]  Someone has to rip open envelopes and read our jokes.  Travis.  That's right.  And then we'll ask for wow stickers and get them eight months later.  And why does Derek have a pink pen in his mouth like it's a small dog cup?  Fucking open-toed shoes he wears.  Mandels.  All right.  We're going to end with this.  Derek's shoes have AIDS.  We're going to end with this.  And I'm going to point in everything to make it dramatic.  Dramatic close.  Let's close.  Brian from Washington, D.C. on the instant feedback. 
[04:15:00]  Jim is a cunt.  Opie is an idiot savant.  Anthony is a Nazi.  Right.  And Ralphie is a fat fuck.  Yes.  Now go try on clothing, faggots.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  Guys get shirts.  Guys get shirts. 
[04:15:30]  Don't make a fucking maniac of it.  You dick.  Dick, dick, dick, dick.  You dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.  Guys get shirts.  Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt.  Don't make a fucking maniac of it.  Guys, guys get shirts.  Guys get shirts. 
[04:16:00]  Don't make a fucking maniac of it. </pre>
