<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of Barack Obama's presidential election victory. Anthony initially commented on the widespread joy among African Americans, adding a somewhat surprising observation that Obama's being half-white was reassuring to him.  The conversation then moved to media reactions, particularly Elizabeth Hasselbeck's perceived political realignment. They described the exuberant atmosphere in New York City after the election, drawing comparisons to the mood following 9/11, and noted the unusually high demand for newspapers the following morning.

A substantial segment focused on Tampa Bay radio DJ Mark Larson, who appeared on his morning show in blackface after losing a bet on the election outcome.  Opie and Anthony played audio and video clips of Larson applying the makeup and explaining his actions.  The hosts discussed the controversy surrounding his actions, comparing it to instances of blackface in films like *Soul Man* and *Tropic Thunder*, and debated the potential consequences, including the likelihood of his dismissal.

A caller, Steve, phoned in, prompting a discussion about the emotional responses of celebrities to Obama's win.  This led to commentary on Oprah Winfrey's on-air appearance in a "Hope One" sweatshirt and her tearful reaction at a rally.  Rumors surrounding Stedman Graham's absence from Oprah's side during the celebrations were also discussed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Greetings.  How are you, Anthony?  All right.  You know, it's all sinking in.  You're dealing with this reality?  Yeah, you know.  You know how you just kind of realize your fate,  and then you kind of go with it? 
[00:00:30]  I was fine.  Like, I'm all right at home.  Then I come in here,  and all of our guys start, like,  whipping around and playing clips and stuff  in the office,  and I just get infuriated again.  You should just be swept away with this whole movement.  Let's go.  I also did a little rationalizing last night  about the whole thing.  Of course, we're talking about President-elect Obama.  Oh, I thought we were talking about the Knicks victory last night.  No, no. 
[00:01:00]  What's his name, Nate?  Nate Robinson?  Close.  Nice.  So what's your realization?  Um, I see a lot of African-American people  are very happy.  Yeah.  The news is just packed.  Yeah.  With interviews with people on the streets,  celebrities, whatever it is.  All the African-American people are very happy,  crying, saying it gives them this new hope,  the children, for their children. 
[00:01:30]  And, uh, hey, he's half white.  That's what your realization is?  I'm not even talking like a white grandmother.  The guy is 50-50.  That's exactly half.  He is half white.  Oh, my God.  I'm a half-full glass kind of guy now.  The guy is half white.  I thought you were going to, like,  say something very, very nice and profound.  He's as much white as he is black. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  So I'm like, you know,  maybe I could deal with that on some level.  Well, the first time he screws up,  that will come out by the black community.  Oh, absolutely.  But, uh, you know, hey.  Why can't we turn you a little bit?  Elizabeth Hasselbeck, or whatever the hell her name is,  who was a huge McCain supporter,  and now she's rah-rah Obama.  Oh, God.  Rah-rah-rah Obama.  She drank the Kool-Aid, huh?  She sure did. 
[00:02:30]  And she's big-time friends with Sean Hannity.  Half white.  That's your realization.  That is my realization.  After sleeping on this for a day.  I thought it over, and, uh, you know,  all the African-American people that are really psyched  about finally having a black president,  but he's half white.  You know.  Hey.  There's a feeling in the streets, Anthony.  I got half a president for me. 
[00:03:00]  You should walk around Manhattan.  There's a feeling in the streets.  It's sort of, uh...  I was there.  Sort of like what was going on around 9-11.  Kind of a, you know, something is happening, and you're...  You're out of your mind?  I'm telling you.  I didn't notice anything.  Because you get in your car, and you drive home,  and you hide in your house.  Let me think.  Walk the streets a little bit today.  It's still the same dopey pedestrians in my way.  Just watch out for that homeless guy with the lipstick.  But besides him...  Oh, yeah.  There is something going on out there.  There's kind of an acknowledgement that something big just happened. 
[00:03:30]  Something big.  I'm telling you.  Did you feel it, Jimmy?  Walking around yesterday?  Because the half-white guy is president?  Or going to be president?  Yeah.  Just, I've had very polite interactions with people.  Yeah, there's...  Very pleasant interactions.  Yeah, there's an acknowledgement going on.  There's almost like a nod.  People are, like, nodding at people in Manhattan.  And that never happens, because we all just ignore every other human being in New York City.  And then my girl, she wanted to pick up the paper, you know, to read the Obama thing. 
[00:04:00]  The news guy laughed at us.  He goes, papers?  He goes, we sold out of the papers at 9 a.m.  Yeah.  That never happens.  You know how many...  People kicked out of their houses can keep warm on the benches.  You never see that.  People are collecting them.  They think they're going to be worth money.  There's so many newsstands in New York City, and to have them all sold out at 9 a.m. yesterday,  that's insane.  Not quite a Dewey defeats Truman.  There's something going on, my friend.  I wouldn't...  I don't think it's going to be a big one. 
[00:04:30]  Huh?  I don't think it's going to be a big collector's item.  No, there's too many of them.  Yeah.  Stop.  They're all buying the papers.  I was down in Philly yesterday doing wedding crap.  But what I saw...  You know when your team wins, like, the World Series or the Super Bowl,  next thing you know, the whole town has brand new, shiny, like, merchandise.  Yeah.  Philly was filled with Obama merchandise.  Oh.  And I mean filled.  Wow, I thought you were going to say something else. 
[00:05:00]  Filled.  Yeah.  The Obama hats, the fancy...  Of course.  The fancy, like, spray-painted Obama, like, portrait T-shirts.  They're everywhere down there.  Philly is, you know...  Everywhere.  Philly's got some issues.  I don't know.  They were having a tough time with this election.  There was a tug-of-war going on.  Yeah, was there?  Yes, there was, my friend.  In the end, Obama won Pennsylvania.  Uh, who?  Obama.  Oh, oh, Obama, right, right.  Why, why, why, why? 
[00:05:30]  No, because I get confused.  I'm just going to call him Barry, his original name.  That helps you, too?  His name's Barry, and he's half-white.  It's easy to...  That's doable.  I could...  I might be able to get along four years with that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, at least you didn't come in here in blackface like another DJ did.  No.  You mean Mr. Fired, so fired, fired, fired?  Mr. So, so, so fired.  Who?  What a dummy.  Who came in blackface? 
[00:06:00]  Some dummy in Tampa Bay.  Some jock.  Mark, uh...  Radio guy that apparently has been living in a cave for a while and hasn't been watching  the news or anything.  And you're on the radio.  Why would you do that?  Just tell everybody you're in blackface.  He had a camera in front of his face, too.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of not paying attention to what the business has become, too, by the way.  Yeah, exactly.  Uh, you want me to play this real fast?  Mark Larson's Morning Magazine, it's called.  And he decided to do it in blackface.  What an idiot. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Yikes.  And good morning.  It's the Morning Magazine.  Mark Larson here.  We are at 6.08.  You hear?  He's a blackface.  President-elect.  His name is Barack Hussein Obama.  And we'll all be waiting to see if he actually says his name when he puts his hand on the  correct, I mean, Bible, coming up in January, when he is sworn in as President of the United  States as a world citizen.  Whoa.  Whoa.  He says he did it because he lost a bet. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, really?  A while back.  Well, is it to keep his job?  Well, he explains the bit right here.  I also have to get my makeup on today.  As I eat crow, last winter during the process, and I didn't put it on on the way in.  God forbid, if I had been pulled over on the Howard Franklin Bridge.  Mrs. Crow?  The way in.  God forbid, if I had been pulled over on the Howard Franklin Bridge with blackface on, I 
[00:07:30]  would have been in big trouble.  So I will take care of business during the break.  Roger is already all set.  But I opened my pie hole last winter and said there is no way this country will elect a guy  named Hussein.  And if they did, I'd come in the next morning in blackface.  Well, here we are.  It's the next morning.  And I will be applying the cream makeup, which Dan got that last night.  Not you, Dan, the other Dan.  Yes.  Got this at the party supply store last night.  And I'll be putting that on.  And I'm afraid I'm going to look a little weird because, you know, with the gray mustache 
[00:08:00]  and everything, I'm going to wind up probably looking like an Uncle Tom.  It's going to be kind of weird.  What an idiot.  Just an idiot.  Does this guy need a vacation?  Did he just say, like, screw it?  What a jerk.  I really need a vacation.  I just want a lot of time off.  Yeah.  You can't wear the makeup of another race unless you're one of the Waynes brothers making  a movie about white girls.  Or Chappelle being a news guy on the Chappelle show or anything. 
[00:08:30]  The rules state very clearly that white people can't do this.  Black people can't.  Yes.  I get the blackface thing.  Like, for a long time, blacks weren't allowed to work.  It was degrading.  But look, if you're, you know.  If I wanted to do an imitation, a visual imitation of a black person,  then how would I do that?  I would have to, you know, darken the skin, put on a little afro.  But you can't do that. 
[00:09:00]  But it's funny when black guys put white face on and, you know,  walk around and talk like this.  Hi, I'm a businessman.  Hello.  Hey, honey, I'm home.  You know, that whole thing.  I think the last time a white guy did this, very good, Danny.  Soul man was the last time whitey got away with this.  Soul man.  Well, not necessarily.  Oh, oh.  What about Tropic Thunder, I guess?  Oh, Tropic Thunder, okay.  You know what?  You know what?  You're right.  Correct.  I stand corrected.  Me too.  Although it does happen way more the other way around than that,  than the white guy. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, but it's still allowed the other way.  I forgot Tropic Thunder, too.  Yeah.  All right.  More Mark Larson as he applies the black makeup.  The black cream.  Oh, good heavens.  Why did I say that last winter?  I completely forgot.  Why did I say that last winter?  Oh, winter.  Good gravy.  With that radio voice, why did I say that last winter?  Now I've got to wear blackface.  Oh, forgotten about it.  And Dan brought it up a couple of weeks ago.  Hey, don't forget if Obama wins, he got a communion blackface.  Me, he, he, he, he, he.  So, why don't you punch Dan in the face and tell him to go F himself? 
[00:10:00]  No, I'd like to keep my job, idiot.  That's basically what Ann told me yesterday when I tried to collect my $100.  Yeah, my $25.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm sharing the wealth.  I'm spreading it around.  Roger, you look like you just came out of a fire.  Well, how do you think I feel?  I was the dumb one who a year ago said, yes, I'll do it, too.  And I'm wearing this.  And you're still white.  Well, no, I'll put this stuff on.  Oh, and I'm going to want to get this.  Does it just, oh, good.  Oh, it goes on real good.  Oh, good Lord. 
[00:10:30]  It goes on very easily.  I look like a football player now.  You know how they put that black knife?  It's going to get over my glasses.  I don't know if this guy's going to get fired, to be honest with you.  Yeah?  Why?  Where are we at with him?  Did he get suspended?  No, like nothing happened.  He made a statement saying, hey, I'm tired of double standards.  He kind of, you know, went on the offensive right away.  Yeah.  Without, um.  We're usually pretty good at this.  I don't think this guy gets fired.  It was a bet.  It sounds like that other guy, Dan, is a black guy, right?  No, he was in blackface, too.  Oh, he was in blackface. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, really?  The whole station?  Oh.  Yeah.  Everyone thought they flipped formats?  No, no, no.  It's just a bet we all lost.  Well, if there's a black person associated with the show, then I think he would, you know,  be pretty safe.  I don't think there is.  He shouldn't be fired, though.  I mean, I think, yeah, you're right.  The Tropic Thunder, it's like he's done in movies.  Why can't a radio guy do it?  Right.  Well, radio guys can't really do anything that can be done in other mediums for some reason.  Yeah.  Watch everything you do.  Every word that comes out of your mouth, you go, check.  Yeah, I told Shayna, the problem I have with this gray mustache, I think I'm going to 
[00:11:30]  wind up looking like Juan Williams.  I just want some of that stuff in it.  I'll take care of that.  Are you sure this stuff comes off?  Yeah, I used some 409 on my hand so I could adjust the controls.  I'll tell you, if this stuff doesn't come off, I'm going to have to run for president.  I was almost thinking maybe I should do half and a half, you know, kind of like Barack  Obama.  Hey, Roger, how am I doing?  You're doing pretty good, except get the mustache.  That stuff will...  No.  God, no.  No, no, this gives me kind of that Uncle Tom feel.  I'll get some more...  Are you sure this comes off?  Uh, you know what? 
[00:12:00]  What?  It doesn't come off.  Really?  I kind of look like a raccoon here.  All right, there we go.  You know, why do I feel like Al Jolson all of a sudden?  I get...  Mammy.  Mammy.  All right, here we go.  Uh, well.  You made that really exciting for everybody, huh?  Yeah.  So, do we know anything?  Is the guy suspended or...  No.  No?  I think he'll be all right.  I think he should be.  He's just a, like, goofy, goofy radio guy.  He should be suspended simply because he had an awful radio voice.  There he is. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, there's him in blackface.  We'll put the video up on onaradio.com.  He does look like he just, like, ran out of a fire, though.  It doesn't look like, uh...  No, it looks...  Like real good blackface or anything.  No.  He didn't really want to fully commit, it looks like.  No.  Yeah, it looks like he just has soot on his face.  Yeah.  I think he's gonna get fired.  Why?  Now looking at this?  Why?  Jimmy sees it and he's like, oh, now he's gonna get fired.  Why do you think he's gonna get fired, Jimmy?  Because when there's video of something that they can show on the news, they can continually  show it. 
[00:13:00]  I mean, it's bad enough when they just show the radio board and play your awful audio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When they have the video.  They have video of them like that.  Yeah.  That's pretty damning.  And then, you know, these vultures turn on each other so quickly.  Yeah.  You know, a DJ in Tampa, you know.  Yeah.  We're gonna show you some shocking footage here on the heels of Obama winning the presidency.  Uh, this just should not be happening.  And what sucks, no one in corporate will go on TV and at least try to, like, you know, 
[00:13:30]  help you out a little bit.  No.  They'll just let the media steamroll over you as you, as you stay home with the shades  down, hoping for the best.  Some wormy PD will get out and issue one of those taped apologies that they have to play  every 15 minutes.  You know, the PD.  We here at News Talk 820, why do we have to apologize to African American people who are  offended by...  The same PD that approved of the bit, but now he's gotta, like, you know, separate himself  and save his own ass.  We do not agree with what this jackass did and... 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Throw him under the bus.  Yeah, I think this is a good video to play on every single news organization, so...  Yeah.  Good luck to you, buddy.  What's his name, Mark Larson?  Mark Larson.  Yeah, good luck to you, Mark.  Let's say hi to Steve on Long Island.  Steve, how are you?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I was at the signing last night with Jimmy.  Oh, hey, man.  Thank you.  Me, me.  It was awesome, but there was a problem.  What happened?  I know what Jimmy said in regards to Anthony not being there, but I want to say, 
[00:14:30]  I want to hear it from Anthony's mouth.  What?  What happened?  Why weren't you there?  Nothing.  I just had a, you know, previous engagement.  Yeah, they had a thing.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You promised little Jimmy.  I wasn't afraid.  No, I completely understood.  I had to.  Well, I have some news for Anthony.  Go ahead, so you're talking.  I will.  I'm going to interrupt.  I got some news for Anthony.  His name is Obama, and he's half black.  Oh, yes.  Oh. 
[00:15:00]  It's all right.  He was all black yesterday.  Huh?  He was all black yesterday.  Right.  Now he's half white, and he's Barry.  So it is the black thing.  President Barry.  So it's all about the black thing.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not with him.  Mm-hmm.  It's the news interviewing African Americans, and they're crying, and these celebrities,  I just want to go around and bash them, because this whole thing about how now, finally, things 
[00:15:30]  can be done, now, finally, I feel like I'm part of something, now, finally, I got, you've  been making it for years in this country, and doing very well, because a lot of these  celebrities are starting to spout off.  Well, we could play a few examples after that.  Oh, great.  We got Whoopi and Sherry Shepard from The View.  And I just want to say, why?  I heard Oprah start her show yesterday, hooping, you know, rocking and rolling. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, really?  What did she come out, yelling, screaming?  Woo-ha or something?  She came out, woo-ha, with a sweatshirt on that said, Hope One.  Hope One.  Hope.  Who's Hope?  I didn't even know he was running.  I'd have voted for him.  Ah, yeah.  Hey, I gotta tell you, it's good being president when I'm dead.  Hey, where's my wife, Dolores?  My eyes are bleeding.  Hope One, huh?  Well, and this is for you, Ant, because now you're saying he's half white. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  50-50 where it counts.  There you go.  There you go.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's for you today.  In the White House.  There you go.  He's, you know, a lot of people are, wow, first black president, half white.  Half white.  And to not acknowledge that.  But when he screws up, are you going to acknowledge the black side or the white side?  I don't know.  Uh-huh.  I don't know.  Let me think about that. 
[00:17:00]  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Because I know people will do that.  Oh, on both sides, I think.  Of course, both sides.  Of course.  But, yeah.  Man, the expectations for this guy are way up there.  I think the half white part helped him, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, I think.  Because he did have a lot of white people voting for him.  Uh-huh.  Because I believe growing up in that environment and that type of family helped him out.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  That's all I'm trying to say.  If you think about it, really.  Yeah.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  So, we'll play some clips from Whoopi and Sherry Shepard because they're very, very happy  and making some solid points about Barack Obama being president.  And maybe we can find the Oprah clip, too, because she's very happy.  Although, she didn't have Obama on her show, right?  Nope.  She decided not to play that game with her TV show.  Just because she would have probably had to have had Palin and the other people.  Maybe she couldn't stomach having them on her show, so she just decided not to have 
[00:18:00]  either candidate on.  She does whatever she wants.  Yeah.  It's kind of weird that she didn't, like, have Barack on her show.  That's perfect for her.  She will now.  I'm sure she will now.  Right.  But she probably didn't need to.  Just by showing up, she got him enough publicity.  And by talking about him, she got him enough.  Not that he needed publicity, but.  And she was at the rally in Chicago crying on some stranger's shoulder.  So, everyone's trying to figure out who this guy is.  And she came out and said, I don't know.  I was just so caught up in the whole thing.  I was crying so bad. 
[00:18:30]  And the mascara was running down my face that I kind of cried on some guy's shoulder.  Oprah?  Right next to me.  Yeah.  He got Oprah tears on him?  This guy did, sure.  He's blessed.  Yeah.  That's amazing, then.  Yeah.  Wow.  I guess she was very close to Jesse Jackson, but Jesse Jackson was the video they showed  yesterday.  But Oprah had the same type of moment going on.  Yeah, she was crying.  She was crying, but Gail was really with her most of the time.  She just leaned over on this one guy who happened to be there.  It was all about Oprah and Gail, if you watched the post. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, did she go with Gail?  Where was Stedman?  I think there's an Amber Alert for him.  Oprah and Gail just went together as friends?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  It's good.  Just friends.  And you said Amber Alert just because he's not around anymore?  No one's seen Stedman.  Yeah.  In months.  Well, there's rumors.  A lot of rumors coming out of Chicago.  I've heard the same ones.  A lot of rumors.  If they're true, just come out and say it.  A lot of rumors.  Would people care?  I don't know.  Yes.  At this point.  Oh, they'll care so much.  They'll never watch her again. 
[00:19:30]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's like Ellen.  It's Opie and Anthony. </pre>
