<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton discussing Anthony’s disastrous return from a two-week cruise. Anthony detailed his lost luggage, resulting from severe weather and flight cancellations. He recounted his experience in first class on the initial flight, contrasting it sharply with his eventual coach seat on a replacement flight, and his frustration with American Airlines’ customer service.  He described abandoning his parents and Keith at the airport to secure a seat, claiming he "ran like OJ," and then falsely identifying himself as an American Airlines employee to jump the line. The turbulent replacement flight, during which Anthony filmed laughing while other passengers screamed, provided ample fodder for comedic commentary. The segment also included discussions of the Long Island serial killer case, Anthony’s avoidance of cruise excursions in favor of interacting with monkeys, and an expensive, disappointing sushi dinner.  Several vacation photos were described.

A caller, also named Anthony, then recounted his own luxurious Caribbean cruise, detailing the villas with private pools and bars, accessible only to villa guests. He described excursions, including disappointing dolphin encounters, ATV rides through a Mexican jungle (which included seeing Mayan ruins) and on the streets of St. Martin, snorkeling, and "snuba."  The caller graphically described a video he’d seen of a dolphin seemingly attempting sexual contact with a woman, leading to crude and graphic commentary from the hosts and caller. He further detailed the cruise ship’s amenities, including numerous restaurants and a casino where he initially won before losing.  The caller concluded his account by describing accidentally accessing another passenger's shared files containing teen gay pornography after initially watching gay pornography on the ship’s network.

The next segment delved into the discovery of explicit gay pornography on a coworker's openly accessible laptop during a cruise, followed by graphic descriptions and crude jokes from the hosts.  They speculated about the coworker's profession and intentions. This led to a discussion of a colleague arrested for possessing child pornography discovered on a shared computer folder at a conference, and further discussion about accidentally accessing others' files in shared spaces.  A substantial portion focused on one host's ongoing harassment by a woman relentlessly sending inappropriate text messages and voicemails.  The host read numerous examples, revealing a highly contentious relationship.  Callers shared similar experiences. The segment concluded with a graphic discussion about women competing to recount difficult pregnancy experiences at a family gathering, followed by a discussion of Kobe Bryant's use of a homophobic slur.

The show then transitioned to a scathing review of *Meet the Fockers*, detailing perceived poor production quality, including continuity errors, inconsistencies in Owen Wilson's hairstyle, and digital alterations to the actors' appearances.  Specific scenes were described, including one featuring Robert De Niro with an exaggerated erection. The conversation expanded to a broader discussion of movie mistakes in various films, with listeners calling in to share their observations. A Jewish listener then called in to discuss Passover traditions, leading to crude jokes about Jewish food and customs.  This was followed by further discussion of Anthony's texting stalker, disparaging commentary on a Royal Wedding spoof video, and a call with a psychologist offering an unhelpful profile of the Long Island serial killer.  The segment ended with promotion of Jim Norton’s upcoming comedy shows.

The broadcast’s final segment began with a discussion of an upcoming trip to Chicago, focusing on its food, specifically deep-dish pizza and hot dogs.  A caller, Sergio from Jersey, made a crude joke about Jewish women’s breasts, prompting a humorous, and similarly crude, response from the hosts, culminating in a joke about a future show segment examining said breasts. The segment abruptly shifted to a discussion about teenage girls engaging in lesbian sexual activity, with speculation about its prevalence and age, presented as a common trend, including among underage girls. The segment concluded with promotional material for an upcoming show segment.

[00:03:30]  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cream  style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.

Hey, let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  And this is the Opie and Anthony show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Well, welcome back to you, sir.  Hi.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  Oh, my God.  Yes, we are live.  What day it is?  It's been a fucking weird two weeks.  What day is this?  What day is this, motherfucker?  Monday.  Well, you got to say, it's April 18th, 2011, so people know we're live.  Yeah.  Sometimes you listen to the replay and it says we're live.  Yes.  We can't be live.  I'm not in there.  But I hear my voice.  Boan.  Yeah.  Hi.  Back.  Back from vacation. 
[00:05:00]  Wow.  Looking very tan.  Well, I'm a reddish tan.  You know how this works.  How slappable are those arms?  Oh, God.  I want to just take one.  Big slap.  Spatula right across those arms.  Can I slap your left arm?  Spatula.  And Jimmy slaps your right arm?  Well, look.  It's not that bad.  No.  It's the first couple of days.  But I bet your back is...  It was rough.  ...nice and red, right?  No, I'm all right.  Are you tight?  You got that sunburn tightness?  No.  You know what?  I did for a little while. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  For maybe a day or two.  And then the guinea in me comes out.  The guinea.  You look really healthy with a tan.  Oh, I like it.  I'm all tanned.  Tanned up.  Tanned up, yo.  Now, I was...  Of course, it happens when you're...  And you're kind of in a bad mood because what?  Because I'm back.  No.  Because I had to wake up early.  You had a nice two-week vacation.  You should be nice and relaxed and ready to go.  I know.  There's a couple of things. 
[00:06:00]  First, I just want to say a high and hearty fuck you to American Airlines.  Just, I mean, give me my fucking luggage, you cocksuckers.  You don't have your luggage?  No.  No.  You motherfuckers.  It's just better not to go away these days.  I'm telling you.  This is always a problem.  You have such a good time on vacation, you know?  Yeah.  You have a good time. 
[00:06:30]  And then it has to add to the floor plate.  And then you've got to somehow get your ass back to where you started.  And, uh...  Now, look, I know I can't blame American Airlines for deadly fucking storms that were up the entire East Coast.  Well, you lost your luggage.  People lost their entire home.  Well, you know, it's a flip of the coin, there, Ropey.  It's a flip of the coin.  There was one, what, tornado went right through that house?  You see that video yet?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  That was a nasty one.  Yeah, but we don't know those people. 
[00:07:00]  We know Anthony Cumia.  That's right.  And he needs his luggage back.  I just know my luggage.  And, uh...  That's what I want.  My luggage.  How do they get lost?  Well, let's see.  I, uh...  My flight back was, uh...  on a wonderful first-class seat in a spacious American Airlines 767.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you know the white body.  I know that much.  And when you, um...  When you have all those buttons for your seat... 
[00:07:30]  You know the button you get in the back?  There's that one button that's like, here you go.  Your seat will go back an inch.  Yeah.  There you go.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Pull that up.  We're taking off.  Hey, hey.  An inch?  What?  Really?  And it doesn't go back smoothly, either.  It's just...  No, no, no.  It gives a thud.  And the guy behind you is like, what the fuck happened here?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Well, these, uh...  These, uh...  First-class seats are pretty much their own pods.  The lie-flat seats.  Yes, yes.  You could lie flat in it.  There's a...  Sam Roberts has just popped up a lovely picture of me before I knew the disaster that was waiting 
[00:08:00]  ahead of me.  Which makes this picture so much better.  I know.  I'm laying back.  Laying back.  Look at me.  My entire seat now, from feet to head, takes up four windows.  By the way, I like the little thing of nuts.  I can see that you've already been given some warm nuts in first class.  I was given some warm nuts.  Oh.  And I have a nice glass of red wine with me.  I see the big nuts in his fucking head.  Yes, yes.  I'm laying back. 
[00:08:30]  What the fuck, dude?  I'm laying down.  I'm all full of testosterone.  You sure are.  That's vacation cock right there.  You got two giant coconuts in your jeans.  I was smuggling them.  Wow.  That's four windows?  Yeah.  Four windows.  How many of those seats in first class?  I don't know.  There were like two.  No.  There's...  Hold on.  Yeah.  Ten.  No way.  Ten of those seats.  Yeah.  There's two.  Two rows of two, and then there's one in the middle that's isolated.  Like the captain.  Who would want to be the isolated guy?  I'd love that one.  That's the best seat in the plane. 
[00:09:00]  Why?  That's the one where everyone leaves you alone.  No one left or right of you.  You have your own seat in the middle, and if you're in three...  Up front?  Yeah, in first.  No, no.  I mean like the first row?  No, the first row's not as good because there's no place to put your bag on.  I'm confused.  Yeah, you don't like that.  So where's the isolated seat?  Right in the middle of first class.  Why would they do that?  It's just a space for a seat.  There's not enough room.  Like you have two seats, aisle.  One seat, aisle, two seats.  So they'd go 2-1, 2-2?  2-1-2.  2-1-2, right.  Now if it was a 777, it would be 2-2-2. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I think.  I think.  All right.  Yeah, but suffice to say, what a comfy seat.  Yeah.  Oh, it looks so good.  I'm laying back, and I'm hearing some little chatter about delays because there was a big  rainstorm in Miami, and then there was a ground stoppage at Kennedy because of high winds.  It was bad.  If you remember, it was very windy, very stormy, a lot of thunder, lightning, rain.  What the fuck?  I actually felt my building move for the first time.  It's crazy.  It is scary. 
[00:10:00]  They say these fucking buildings sway.  Yeah.  Finally, after a few years living there, I finally felt it.  It's scary.  It's weird.  I don't know if it's scary.  It's just strange.  Sorry.  No, it's cold.  We were sitting on the plane waiting.  I don't give a shit.  They put us in that parking lot area where when there's a ground stop, they just keep backing  planes into this area.  Oh, God.  And then they said, well, you know, when we finally get to get a go, we'll we'll go.  So we get the go and we go out to the runway and and then he's like, oh, well, look at 
[00:10:30]  this.  We're going to have to go back to the gate because there's a total ground stoppage of  Kennedy.  Oh, and I'm just thinking, just fucking take off.  When we get to Kennedy, deal with Kennedy.  Fucking whatever.  Yeah.  You'll find a place to land.  Just get us in the air.  Plenty of places to land.  Get me close.  You look down.  Anytime there's a runway down there.  Just get us close.  Get us close enough.  Get me to Philly or Cleveland.  I'll fucking drive from there.  Just get me somewhere in the area.  But what I hear is they're taking us back to the gate to refuel us again because we had 
[00:11:00]  been sitting there for so long with the motors running.  I'm like, I don't give a shit.  I'll fucking go to sleep in this thing.  It's like a bed.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's wonderful.  So look at your smug face.  Oh, I'm so smug.  Just rubbing it.  Great.  Just rubbing it into anyone that follows you on Twitter.  Oh, or if anybody was walking past in the aisle, they look at that and are just like,  you motherfucker.  Well, I paid for it dearly because they finally canceled the flight. 
[00:11:30]  And this is directly because of the rule where you can't have a plane sitting and not taking  off within a certain amount of time.  How many hours is it?  Because they've canceled a lot of flights just so they don't have to pay fines.  They don't want to pay the fines anymore.  They just don't want to pay the fines.  I don't even know how long it is, but they don't want to pay a fine.  And so they just cancel the flight.  Everyone get the fuck off the plane.  Well, let's grab your shit and get off.  Is it terrible though?  I mean, how many hours do you think he would have sat there?  I mean, he had a good seat.  Sat there.  I would have laid there like a king.  The problem was that the airlines had like five and six and eight hours where they would 
[00:12:00]  just hold people on planes who wanted to get off.  That's obviously terrible.  Terrible.  But this is like legitimate.  Like this is storms and there's a ground stoppage.  I think what they should do is before you get on the plane, they should say, look, we  don't know, but we may have delays of up to four or five hours as opposed to three.  If you don't want to be on this flight, we'll try to accommodate.  They should give people a choice when it's pure weather.  It's not like it was an equipment malfunction.  It's like 50 mile an hour winds.  What are you going to do?  You can't take off. 
[00:12:30]  That's all it takes.  50 mile an hour winds.  You can't take off.  Well, you can't land.  You might be able to take off.  Yeah.  A good pilot could do it.  Yeah.  Come on.  We Colonel Tibbetts.  We've seen the videos do little, but do little and as his men could have done it.  Yeah, they didn't give a shit and they were being shot at for God's sake.  What is the limit?  I wonder on when what we've landed in like 35 and it was very, very rough.  35 is rough.  And the guy I asked the guy like, what was I asked the pilot?  It was a it was a flight come back from Florida, actually.  And you were wrestled to the ground.  I was kicking the door yelling, go home, go back. 
[00:13:00]  I'm frightened.  Frightened.  But I said to him when we landed, I saw him in Starbucks.  I'm like, how bad was that wind?  And I think he said it was about a seven out of ten.  I think he asked a one out of ten.  It was it was pretty bad.  So I wonder what the limit is.  I don't know.  I would bet close to 50, man.  Maybe 50.  Probably.  I would think they could do it in 50 mile an hour winds.  It's not going to be fun for anybody.  Well, I got to tell you, I can I can give you a firsthand experience.  Oh, really?  50 mile an hour wind landing is like.  Wow. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, scary, isn't it?  That was fun.  The whole plane like rocking back and forth.  Oh, my God.  It was insanity.  So we we we had to get off that fucking plane.  And now our baggage.  That's that's where the thing is.  Our baggage is on that plane.  And they go.  Well, there's a plane going to LaGuardia.  It's leaving in 10 minutes.  I'm like, oh, what?  Pew.  Wait, so they don't want that plane to take off.  That's going to land at JFK.  But there's a plane that lands at LaGuardia. 
[00:14:00]  I don't know how it works either.  Is that what?  Yeah.  You're going to fly into JFK.  Yeah.  Because I got something on this.  LaGuardia is scary if there's no wind.  I know.  Because they have a short.  They have what?  Short runway.  Very short runway.  They make like banking turns to to to line up for these runways.  Certainly do.  And then the runways are really short.  LaGuardia is really scary to fly.  Yeah.  Well, wait a minute.  That doesn't make sense.  No, it didn't.  No, you know what it is?  Here's what it was.  Because they probably knew they had to wait another hour.  Right.  I guarantee there was a delay on the next flight, right? 
[00:14:30]  Oh!  And the problem is if he was on the original 767, that would have gone past the time.  The LaGuardia flight was probably not going to go past the time for penalties.  You're right.  But the whole delays are because of bad weather and wind.  Yeah.  I would never fly.  So they were lying is what they were doing.  They were lying saying 10 minutes.  So it was boarding in 10 minutes.  Oh, okay.  So me and my girl, we jump on this plane, and now it's a 757 because they can't land  the 767s of LaGuardia. 
[00:15:00]  And I'm in the back.  Oh, boy.  I'm in the back.  No.  I'm in a regular seat.  No.  With the common folk?  Feeling, um...  What happened to that guy?  That guy...  What happened to that guy?  That guy got fucked in the ass as we look at your picture.  That guy got fucked.  Look at the guy with his warm nuts sleeping with his glass of wine in his hand.  You know what happened to him?  He was in the back with a fucking tube of knockoff Pringles and a fucking water.  No.  Yes.  It was so upsetting. 
[00:15:30]  Are you okay?  I'm fancy.  And I couldn't have the fancy...  And the worst thing is there is a first class section on that plane.  I had to walk through it and look at another guy laying back with a glass of wine.  Now you know how it feels.  It sucks.  When they walk by you, sir.  It sucks.  And I had my first class ticket.  And I just kept saying, you know, I was supposed to be in here.  Hoping the stewardess would be like, oh, we're sorry, sir.  We'll bring you every amenity that the first class people have back there in row fucking 20. 
[00:16:00]  It doesn't work that way.  No, it doesn't.  You're only as good as the flight you're on.  Right.  I don't care if your name is Frank American Airlines.  When you're in coach on that plane, your name is fucking Gary Garbage.  It really is.  You are absolutely right because that's exactly what happened.  I sat there and was just like, motherfucker.  But you know what?  All I'm thinking is, I'll just get my ass the fuck home.  It's from Miami to New York.  It's not like it's a cross-country flight. 
[00:16:30]  It's three hours.  Not that way anyway.  Two and a half hours, right?  Well, without a billion mile an hour headwind, which increased the flight time to three and a half hours.  Yeah.  Three and a half hours.  That was if it took off at that point, which it didn't.  Um, it, uh, we sat there for quite some time waiting to take off.  Uh, my flight, my original flight was leaving Miami at about 2 p.m.  That's the one you got off.  Two in the afternoon.  That was the one I wanted to get, at 2 p.m. 
[00:17:00]  We were supposed to be, as they say, wheels up at about 2 p.m.  You would have been, you would have landed by 4.30 tops.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it.  Okay.  Um, I don't think we left the ground.  Uh, I think.  It had to be about, uh, uh, uh, six hours later.  Eight o'clock at night.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and now without my luggage, you know, because the  luggage is on that other plane, and God knows what that's all about, because now that plane 
[00:17:30]  isn't going to New York.  It's just not going to New York.  So they take all the luggage off, pile it up in Miami somewhere, and whenever they decide  where that plane's going, they load the new luggage and people on, and there it goes.  How long were you sitting in the coach seat?  I mean, three and a half hour flight, but did you have to wait before you took off?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How long?  Um, maybe an hour or so, I, eh.  If you had waited, like, what did the people, like, what did, uh, you were with your parents  and Keith, so what did they do?  Oh, well, I abandoned them. 
[00:18:00]  See, I ran my ass off to the counter.  You blew off your own family?  Look, I had to get home.  You can't blow off your own family.  I know, but.  I understand you blow us off, but you can't blow your own mom off.  Look, I, I, I, I love them.  Did you really?  But I, I had to get out of there.  What were they going to do for them, though?  What was the airline doing?  I, I don't know.  It was, it really, it really.  You left them behind?  It was really every man for himself at that point, and I had to just, uh.  It's your mom. 
[00:18:30]  I know, I felt bad, but they walk so slow these days.  They walk very slowly, and I don't think I would have made that flight.  Hold on, hold on.  So, so you found out if, if you could run, you could get another flight, and then you  looked at your parents and realized they can't run anymore and said, bye-bye?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was, what, what, what, what, what did you say to them?  I really didn't.  Have you talked to them since?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I pretty much, um, I pretty much gave them to, to Keith and Ange. 
[00:19:00]  And said, take care of them.  Um, well, yeah, I, I didn't even have really time to say that.  I just fled the plane and ran, ran like OJ in the old commercials through the airport.  You guys got to all stick together.  No, no, no.  No?  This is every man.  I knew we wouldn't get a seat on the same flight at this point.  It was pandemonium, because we were one plane going to New York.  There were a lot of planes going to New York, and every one of them were being canceled.  So there was this, they said, now go to gate, uh, please go to gate 37 for a reassignment 
[00:19:30]  of flights.  Like, all right, so I go to that gate, I'm waiting, I'm first on line.  I'm right at the desk going, motherfucker, man.  Here we go.  You just wait, and I'm waiting for the person, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.  And I'm thinking I could get, you know, seats for everybody.  And then I notice there's a big line at some other counter that's starting up, and there's  only a few people behind me. 
[00:20:00]  I'm like, there were a lot of people on these planes and shit.  And I look over, and it's that customer fucking service thing.  It wasn't, I was not, I made it first.  Right.  Would have been first on that one, but they, it was the wrong place.  Was it your fault or theirs?  I think it was theirs.  They said the gate.  They said 37.  They said the gate.  It wasn't the thing next to the gate.  So I, I take my bags, I go, I'm not fucking waiting.  So I just grabbed, and I cut everyone in.  I cut in front of everybody, went right to a woman, and I hear, hey, hey, hey, from behind. 
[00:20:30]  And I turn around and go, I work for American Airlines.  Oh my God.  What's wrong with you?  I want it out.  You pull off your own parents, and then you're just a dick to everyone else.  I work for American Airlines.  He's the greatest.  Wait a minute.  So what did the American Airlines people say?  Well, I did it so they couldn't really hear it.  Of course, yeah.  I turned to the people that were, the angry mob, as it were, and I told them I work for  American.  Oh my God.  And then the guy, one guy actually goes, well, you're going to be getting a letter from me. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, really?  I'm like, yeah, sure I am.  I can't read letters because you're.  Sure I am.  Because you work for me.  We send it to Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Because that's where I really work.  So I went right up to the woman.  That's kind of smart.  For American.  That's kind of smart.  Went right up to the woman.  And I say, hey, you know, like I canceled that.  We need this, that, the other thing.  Why not?  Why not just like bail on the whole thing and take another day or two in Miami?  How did we got to get back?  Why?  No one's no one paid attention.  I know.  They don't even know you're back at this point.  And look, in hindsight, you're absolutely right. 
[00:21:30]  Who runs this place?  I don't even know who runs this place.  Like I said, in hindsight, you are right.  Because it's a crazy airport situation.  The weather's horrible.  Well, you go, you know what?  I'm bailing.  Yeah.  You make a couple phone calls.  And now you're nice on South Street in Miami?  I'm hearing you.  That's what I would have done.  But I got caught up in that airport frenzy where it's like...  Every man for themselves.  Every man for themselves.  You've got to get out of there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You go there.  You've got to find another flight immediately.  Bah! 
[00:22:00]  It was crazy.  I would have bailed.  I would have done what he did, though.  I'm an ass like that, too, where I would just panic and leave.  The only reason...  I would have bailed just because it's Miami.  Miami's all right.  Yeah, yeah.  If you're going to be stuck somewhere, Miami's all right.  That's true.  It's not like you're stuck in Cleveland or something.  That's true.  I know.  I should have.  But like I said...  All right.  So now you tell everyone you work for American Airlines.  I work for American Airlines.  What are the people behind the counter?  Did they ask for your ID as an American Airlines employee?  That's just it.  They didn't hear it.  Smart.  I turned and said it to the angry mob that I had just cut in front of. 
[00:22:30]  And they were so busy with other people already that they weren't paying attention to me.  So I made myself next in line in front of what had to be 90 angry, angry people.  Definitely an asshole move, but also very smart.  Had to do it.  Had to do it.  Very smart.  Almost brilliant.  And I was first online at the place they sent me to.  37.  So I figured I was entitled.  And I was first class. 
[00:23:00]  See?  So I'm entitled to first online.  So you said, I want to get on this plane.  They said, first is sold out.  Yeah, I said, get me on a plane.  And they go, first is sold out.  I'm like, motherfucker.  And as you're doing this, your parents are just wandering around the airport lost.  Well, Keith and Andrew are wonderful with taking care of them.  And I was trying to get...  I can't wait to hear when they got home, by the way.  Well, I was trying to get a flight for everyone.  That's why I wanted to get first.  I wanted to get there first.  Are you saying that now?  No, no.  I wanted a flight for everybody. 
[00:23:30]  You did.  But, you know, I would have needed six seats.  And all they had left were two seats.  I would have done the same thing.  So I had to take the two seats.  I don't know if I would have had the balls to do it, though.  It's like the old lifeboat in the Titanic thing, you know?  That's your mom.  Yeah, sometimes.  She sacrificed a lot for you.  I know, sometimes.  Did they pay for the trip or did you?  Well, they paid for theirs.  Paid for mine.  Oh, you didn't pay for that trip?  No, no.  They got money. 
[00:24:00]  I thought he paid for the trip.  They do all right.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they do.  Yeah.  But, yeah, yeah.  Like I said, caught up in the frenzy.  Had to make the move.  So I got on that plane.  And Keith found a flight to come back on also.  When does that take off?  Today?  Now it's a little later.  A little?  Come on.  I think they got back to the house sometime. 
[00:24:30]  I think they wound up getting home about 3 in the morning or something.  Wow.  It was bad.  Actually, that's not bad because you left at 8.  It was bad.  Yeah.  So we finally get, like, and again, all of our luggage is gone.  We still don't have it.  Everyone from the trip.  Keith, my parents, everybody's luggage is just lost somewhere.  How horrible for them to not handle that better.  I know.  That's just it.  They don't handle it.  And then I get a call.  And you're supposed to call a number and give them a number. 
[00:25:00]  And I got somebody else on the phone.  They're barely speaking English.  And I just want to know where my shit is.  And then they never know.  And I said, I go, you know, I go, could you do me a favor?  Walk me through the process here.  I don't know.  I'm not just going to hang up with no knowledge of what happens, what the protocol is.  Where is my baggage?  How does it make it back up here?  When does it?  When do I know when they've found it? 
[00:25:30]  And how does that happen?  Like, don't just tell me we can't find it yet.  Right.  Yeah, but you're fast forwarding.  I mean.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you're on this plane.  I'm on this 7.57.  You're not in first class anymore.  You're in the back with your horrible potato chips and water.  Yeah, I'm in the shit section.  And you finally take off after you've been on the plane an hour or so?  You finally take off.  And the pilot's like, uh...  Ladies and gentlemen, we had storms in Hedwin.  It's going to take us on a different route.  This flight is going to be three and a half hours.  Which, you know, normally it has been a two-hour flight. 
[00:26:00]  Did he tell you they're going to hit a little bumpy air, a little chop?  Uh, the beginning of the flight's going to be relatively smooth.  Uh, so we're going to turn off the fast seatbelt lights and the flight crew's going to come  around and serve beverages and food.  Uh, the second half of the flight could get a little choppy.  A little chop.  Mm-hmm.  So, you just told them chop, right?  Yeah, yeah, I just told them chop.  Why?  Holy mother of fuck.  Yeah, the microphone's still on. 
[00:26:30]  Uh, you might want to chop.  So, yeah, the second half is going to be a little choppy.  Yeah.  Well, the first half was very, very lovely.  Lovely.  With my fucking knockoff Pringles and water.  Nice.  Uh, finally the booze cart came around, so I got, uh...  I said, could I have...  The whole cart.  Yeah, exactly.  One of those, and he points to the cart.  Could I have...  Just leave that here.  Just leave the whole thing.  I opted for the Jack Daniels and Coke.  And, uh, I had her leave quite a few of those little bottles. 
[00:27:00]  Really?  Quite a few of the little bottles.  And, uh, a couple of cans of Coke and some ice.  And now I'm just like, alright.  This'll make this shitty seat a little better.  Yeah.  Uh, sitting there.  And then we, um...  I'm looking out the, uh, the window now.  I'm on the left side, the right side of the plane.  So I'm looking, and we are...  Usually when you fly from Miami to New York, you're over the water for a certain period of time.  And I'm noticing a lot of land. 
[00:27:30]  Like, I'm seeing lights and shit.  And this is out of the right side of the plane.  So we went pretty far west.  We went pretty far west.  And the sky is fucking...  Dark.  Lighting up.  No.  But, but...  Oh, really?  I've never seen lightning from the air like that.  It didn't stop.  It was a constant barrage.  Probably ten strikes every second.  Jeez.  It was like paparazzi going off in the clouds.  Where the fuck are they flying at all? 
[00:28:00]  And all I'm thinking is, we have to make a right at some point.  Into this shit.  We have to turn and go to New York.  You know, we're way over...  We're pretty far west, so we gotta turn.  And, um...  And then that wing dips.  And then I go, okay.  Here we go.  Just relax, because here it comes.  So I pull out the camera.  And I shove it into the window.  And just hold it there.  And, uh... 
[00:28:30]  The shit you see in this fucking video...  You got it posted yet?  You hear...  Whoop!  The plane drops you.  Whoop!  You hear screaming.  Oh, people yelling.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  People are screaming.  Where's this video?  I'm just...  It's on my camera.  Well, get it up online.  Maybe my camera will end up, you know, in...  No, actually, I have my camera.  I carry on.  Wait, how bad of a...  I had that one.  In the 767, I've hit horrendous turbulence.  This is the 757.  I'm not as scared on a gigantic plane like that. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  757 is not a bad-sized plane.  That's a big fucking plane.  It's big.  It's between the 67 and the 37.  So, it's a big plane.  But the wings were flapping.  They were flapping.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  And the thing was doing that...  Boom, donk.  Dug, donk, donk.  Where the wings are just...  You know the guys up front just keeping it level.  Let's keep it level.  And we're dropping a lot.  We're doing a lot of that...  Boom, boom.  And then you catch again. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He accelerates to get back up to altitude.  And then, boom, you drop again.  And then the plane goes sideways a little bit.  And he's, like, turning because he's trying to dodge the fucking storm clouds.  And so now we're coming into final.  And how long are you having this horrible fucking bouncing for?  This could be for an hour of just...  An hour of just...  Were you freaked out?  No, I didn't give a shit.  At that point, I was like, crash this bitch. 
[00:30:00]  Crash into the fucking ground.  I don't care.  You weren't freaked out.  Come on.  I didn't care.  No, no.  You hear it on the video.  I'm laughing.  I'm going, ha, ha, ha, look at this shit.  Oh, my God.  Could you just plow this into the ground?  Other people freaked out?  Yeah.  You hear it on the tape?  Yep.  How was your chick?  Was she nervous?  Oh, yeah.  She let out a good gasp.  At one point, you hear her scream on the video.  Wah!  And I'm just like, oh, that was a good one.  I was like the crazy person on the plane. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  You fucking lunatic.  I didn't give a shit.  I wasn't in first class.  I had shitty potato chips.  Crashed the plane.  Yeah.  It's a lot of stuff.  What's that?  Yeah.  Worst flight ever?  Probably the bumpiest.  Bumpiest?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dude, I was thinking of him because the wind was so bad in New York.  It was crazy.  I was texting him.  I'm like, he has to land in this shit.  I couldn't believe they were even taking off and coming into this area.  It was insanity.  And then now we have to go, like, there's no more flying around shit. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  When you're on final, all right, he's now on final.  He's got to now go into the clouds.  Yeah.  And when you fucking first see the clouds, and I know right when we go into them, it  just gets even worse.  So it was just, now you're looking out the window, all you see is white, whizzing  by, and you're bouncing like a lunatic.  And you hope when you pop out the bottom, there's a runway there because the magic man  in the front knows how to make the runway show up in front of this crate in the middle 
[00:31:30]  of this fucking weather.  And lo and behold, there it was.  But again, it was LaGuardia.  So it was a bam, nice hard hit.  And then the, everybody just starts applauding.  And that's when you should applaud.  Yeah.  They applaud when it's the smoothest flight ever in sunny weather.  It's like, why are you applauding?  Yeah.  Save that for this shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do they have any, this is the worst when you're in weather like that and they have 
[00:32:00]  to make banks in that weather.  Like when you're coming in on final approach, when, and every time you turn right or left,  you're fucking like, we're going to flip over.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Yeah.  And the applauding just means thanks for not killing us.  Yes.  Thank you.  That's what that means.  You didn't kill us.  Thank you, sir.  You're the best pilot ever for making us stay alive.  Oh, that sucks.  Yeah, well, we got down there and then I had to go and file my grievance about the luggage.  And there's a line there.  So now I'm waiting and I'm hearing the guy behind the counter trying to talk to a woman 
[00:32:30]  who also needs her baggage.  And she's saying, yes, my address, and I'll just give some generic address.  My address is 5 Elm Street in Elmont, New York.  5 Elm Street in Elmont, Elmont, Elmont.  And now I'm standing there.  I actually went in this little room full of people. 
[00:33:00]  Holy shit.  This is going to take forever.  I go, we got a guy.  I go, we got a guy that can't speak English that's trying to tell people where their fucking  luggage is going.  And now everybody's looking at me like I'm a complete lunatic.  Some of the white people are looking like, yeah, motherfucker, I don't want to sit through  this.  And the Hispanic motherfuckers are looking at me like I'm the racist pig that I am.  Yeah, look at, like, but you know what?  Get a fucking English speaking motherfucker behind the counter so that when I give my 
[00:33:30]  address, I don't have to go 20 times and have him write, scrawl something down that doesn't  fucking fit.  That ain't my address.  Cocksucker.  So I'm just yelling that, that why the fuck doesn't an English speaking guy, isn't he  working here?  You're right, though.  You're fucking right.  The guy should be absolutely fluent in English if he's bilingual so he can handle the Spanish  customer customers and the English speaking customers. 
[00:34:00]  That's one thing.  But he's tripping over his tongue trying to say Elm Street.  Yeah.  So you finally got up to him.  I get up to him.  I wonder why he might have written Anthony's address down wrong.  Yeah, perhaps that's why I don't have my baggage yet.  No, I didn't.  I wasn't up to him.  I went up to another person and fill out all the paperwork, all the bullshit.  You're looking at a picture book of bags.  You got to look at the picture book and go, that one looks like mine. 
[00:34:30]  That one's that.  So they're scanning the ones it looks like.  Why would they do that?  Just so they get a little more info on your bag.  But you got.  It's like there's a tag on the fucking thing.  There's a tag on it.  With my name's on it and shit.  Could you fucking just get it?  And by the way, they should know what your bag is at every moment.  Yes.  Because they scan it.  Boop.  Yeah.  It's a fucking computer system.  Don't tell me it takes time.  It should be automatically everywhere on the computer system the second they scan it.  Yeah, don't tell me you don't know where the fuck it is.  That sucks. 
[00:35:00]  That's horrible.  So then I'm just waiting in front for car service to show up in the pouring rain.  And I'm on the phone with him.  Why don't you get one of those guys in the poster?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Those guys.  Do not accept rides from these two.  Why not?  They will get you to New York quick.  Because I had a guy set up now.  I had preemptively a key that set up one of his guys that he knows to come to LaGuardia  to get me.  And now I'm on an iPhone that is saying 1% power. 
[00:35:30]  And I'm just, where are you?  I told him where I am.  And it's like, okay, he's driving around.  Finally picked up.  Finally home.  I sat down on the couch.  And I was just beside myself, stunned.  And then Keith and my parents got back to my house like 3 in the morning or whatever.  What time did you finally get in?  It was after midnight. 
[00:36:00]  Okay, so about three hours.  Yeah, yeah.  It was crazy.  I fell asleep on the couch.  They came in, went upstairs, went to bed.  And then they left in the morning without any bag of luggage or anything.  And I yesterday spent the day trying to find my luggage, which I didn't.  And that was the great trip home.  And that topped off just a great vacation.  They have a way of making you forget the great time you had. 
[00:36:30]  Like now I'm sitting there, right?  I'm home from vacation.  I have all these great memories.  Hopi, I kissed a dolphin.  That was wonderful.  What's wrong with you?  You have great memories.  Now that dolphin has to have a fucking Valtrex put in its fish.  It's fish.  Before they drop it in its mouth.  Oh, my God.  But you don't remember any of that because...  Because of the trip back.  Because now you need another vacation just from your ride home. 
[00:37:00]  The sweet, the beautiful sweet I had was amazing.  Oh, the movie poster.  The memories, right?  The memories.  Look.  Wowee.  See what I mean?  And see is spelled S-E-A.  The ship's going to hit the fan.  And it's one of those back-to-back movie posters.  She's got you.  Yeah, she's got me.  Look out.  She actually looks like she belongs on a movie poster, though.  Oh, I know.  You look like a creep that just wandered into the photo shoot.  That's exactly what it was. 
[00:37:30]  That's exactly what the vacation was.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, it was all the memories that were all erased by American Airlines.  And your shitty ride home.  And my shit ride home and my goddamn...  Look.  Look at that.  Monkeys.  Me and Reverend Al...  Oh.  Me, I was on...  I forgot.  That was a different picture.  That's a different one.  That's...  Yeah.  We're there in Cozumel.  Cozumel.  And I got a little monkey on my shoulder.  Look at how cute he is. 
[00:38:00]  Perfectly.  It matches the six on your back.  Jesus.  Yes!  Oh, gosh.  The view from the balcony.  Look at me.  All sunburned with a nice bottle of bud.  What the fuck?  Your forehead is really red in that one.  That was a big...  Yeah, that was like day two.  That was early on, right?  Day two, I got a big burn.  Before you get the...  Wow, we...  Big burn.  Did a lot of excursions.  Went through the jungle on an ATV. 
[00:38:30]  Nice.  Took an ATV, and it wasn't one of the...  I did two ATV excursions.  Wait, you're speeding through all this.  We should take a break, and then you should get to the regular vacation.  Ah, to the vacation.  Because I want to hear about the suite.  I want to hear about the gambling.  I want to hear about the dolphins, the ATVs, the Mexican ruins, the underwater shit.  The ghetto.  Yeah, why are you speeding through this?  Is that your suite?  Well, that's half of it, Jim.  Wow.  If you walk down and then around, the bedroom and bathroom section is there, and then there's 
[00:39:00]  another room to the left.  It was an awesome suite.  It was the best suite on the ship.  The balcony was giant.  It was just...  It made me sitting in that fucking seat on American Airlines with those Pringles knockoffs that  much worse.  Brings you right back, though.  It's almost like...  It does.  That was Radio Anthony.  Yeah.  But then you realize, like, wow, this is fucking Tin Knocker Anthony.  Yeah.  And it kind of...  As much as it's awful, hey, you're lucky you don't have to do that anymore. 
[00:39:30]  I know.  It was...  You're right.  You're right.  We'll break, because then we could hear about your vacation.  The good part.  Yes, the good part.  Not the American Airlines...  And you better have my baggage today, bastards.  Thank you, Kenny.  I hate those people.  Kenny would never have let that happen, by the way.  Really?  Yes.  He needs his luggage.  You don't understand.  He would just talk to one person, and for some reason, they would actually...  They would drive to Miami and get it, just to stop him from talking to them.  He's a fucking magician. 
[00:40:00]  Or he would have stayed behind and just grabbed your luggage and run in a car.  He would have actually went under the plane and gotten it.  Right.  I'll do it.  He would have pulled the door off like a big clumsy ox and throw it.  Hey, fucking Herman Munster.  Just throw it on the runway.  Lully.  Bags, Lully.  Fucking door pulls off.  All right.  More on Ant's Vacation after the break.  Stay there.  The virus.  Virus.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[00:40:30]  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at opieandanthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony back from vacation.  His flight home was a complete nightmare.  And look, today would have been a nice day to fly, by the way.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's beautiful out there. 
[00:41:00]  Beautiful.  But, no, I decided to fly on the day.  I guess everybody was dying on the East Coast.  Yeah, tornadoes.  Tornadoes all over the place.  All over the South.  North Carolina.  I think Raleigh.  Raleigh, right?  Raleigh.  Raleigh was hit pretty good.  Raleigh.  Raleigh.  But the two-week cruise itself was great, huh?  Oh, God, it was fantastic.  What a blast.  Just, and you brought up a point.  What?  That I actually went on some excursions. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, because we were talking before the show, and I would assume you would just stay in your  lovely suite for two weeks, but you were tweeting, and actually you texted a couple times that,  yeah, I'm doing this and that.  Yeah, I usually don't, you know, leave the ship, go very far.  I've done some things, you know.  No, you definitely did more this time than usual, no?  Yeah.  I got a weird text from Anthony.  It said, Dear Eva, never get off the fucking boat. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, it was a, uh, just a fucking great weather.  It's amazing when you can spend two weeks and not see rain.  It's just not raining.  It's beautiful and sunny the whole time.  It's weird to see the sun every day, right?  Yeah, it was great.  It was hot.  Like, not just warm, just fucking hot.  I love that jungle heat.  It's great.  You have monkeys running around.  Fantastic. 
[00:42:30]  Usually I wouldn't like that, but they're fantastic.  No, I'm just saying.  Everyone's making their jokes.  No, I'm not, no joke, yeah, but they're fun.  They're cute.  They weren't hurting anybody.  It was fantastic.  Their cute little face.  They see the little hands and stuff.  Where's this monkey from?  Were you walking around the rainforest?  It's from Mexico.  But were you walking around in the rainforest?  In Cozumel, yeah.  Or was this a controlled situation?  Oh, this was an environment, yeah.  A little monkey environment.  Okay.  But they had other things, too.  You know, birds.  It's, you know, birds. 
[00:43:00]  Stupid birds.  Stupid birds.  Fucking hate birds.  And, you know, big zip lines and bridges and things that you do.  Did you zip line?  I didn't zip line.  I saw people zip line.  Why did you zip line?  Because I wanted to hang out with the monkeys.  What is zip line?  You were scared to zip line.  No, no.  I would have zip lined.  I would have zip lined.  I would have zip lined.  I would have zip lined.  I would have zip lined.  I would have zip lined.  I've never zip lined.  I want it so badly.  They set up these frigging cables from treetop to treetop.  And you hold on.  And little platforms.  And you click on and...  And the whole time you're walking around, you just hear...  Why didn't you do that? 
[00:43:30]  People are zip line around.  It's like traffic up there.  Why didn't you do that?  I didn't want to zip line.  How about no?  Why would you?  There's fucking bees all over.  What, are you going to zip line right through a hornet's nest?  What's the fuck with that?  That would suck.  You imagine you're zip lining.  All of a sudden, you see a bunch of bees have landed on your location.  And you're fucking doing 80 into them.  Why would you want to do that?  Never.  Why?  Pick a tram to Roosevelt Island.  Safer.  You got harnesses and stuff.  You got a hard hat.  Yeah, they give you a hard hat, a harness, a safety line. 
[00:44:00]  And they were just people zipping and zinging everywhere.  That's cool.  I can't believe you didn't do that.  Watching some of the employees leave the tree on the zip line was kind of funny.  I'm just saying.  It's kind of funny.  They're very good at it.  That's all I'm saying.  Were some of the zip lines pretty impressive over some height?  Over some major height.  And they were getting guys that could get some speed up and stuff.  Where can we zip line around here?  I don't think they got zip line in America.  Let's get a zip line trip together.  Would you go, Jimmy?  Lawsuit city.  No, I would not go.  Here's why they don't have it in America. 
[00:44:30]  Because it's not safe.  No, we have it in America.  Let's all relax.  I know we have it in America.  Let's calm down.  Do they have it in America?  I'm sure.  I'm sure that it's right upstate we could do some zip lining.  I'm positive.  You think they could do zip lining upstate?  Yes.  It's everywhere.  It's becoming a thing.  It's becoming a thing?  It's the thing.  In America?  Yeah, with rope bridges and zip lines.  Zip lining is becoming a thing.  Zip lining is taking off.  You guys have a wonderful zip lining excursion.  Hunter Mountain. 
[00:45:00]  There you go.  Cool.  That's very close to here.  Hunter Mountain does zip lining?  That's what, two hours away maybe?  I did not know that.  I'm fucking zip lining this spring.  Let's go.  Who wants in?  I don't think I'd zip line.  You said you would.  Especially in the U.S.  No, no.  I mean, it just sounds like...  It would be safer in the U.S. than Mexico.  It sounds like it would be cool in Mexico or somewhere, but not there.  Look.  Look at this guy.  Carolina man.  Oh, you're so right.  Zip line in Hawaii recently.  A quarter mile long.  Half mile in the air over a ravine.  Fucking amazing.  Why wouldn't you do that?  I don't doubt that it's quite amazing. 
[00:45:30]  Quite amazing.  Anyway, you decided to hang out with the monkeys instead of the zip liners.  If I had a choice between zip lining and having a spike shoved up my asshole and being carried that way,  I'd take zip lining, but I'd have to think about it.  But you don't do stuff.  Why don't you do stuff?  I do a lot of stuff.  I always do stuff.  I just don't swing from tree to tree by a fucking, by a rope.  I don't do that.  I do lots of stuff.  Yes.  You don't do stuff.  I love doing stuff. 
[00:46:00]  You don't do much.  What?  My nickname is the stuff kid.  You don't do much.  Let's be honest.  You don't like doing stuff.  I do.  I just do different stuff.  What was the last stuff you did?  What do you consider stuff?  Anything.  You went to a prison.  Went to a prison?  Yeah, you went to a prison.  That sounds cool, right?  Fucking.  And then there was that one time you went for sushi.  Columbus.  I fucking, when me and Kenny were in Columbus, I went and did fucking morning press.  Yeah.  Relaxed.  Oh, okay. 
[00:46:30]  See?  Before we get back to that, you do understand my text message to you from the other night,  right?  I went to our sushi joint that you brag about.  Oh, yeah.  It's the best.  I had the worst fucking time there.  Oh.  Because I ordered what you order.  That's, I was trying to make it hurt.  And you were like, yeah, whatever, dude.  I'm busy.  No, I love that stuff.  It was the, uh, it was the chef's special.  Oh, no.  It was horrendous.  I love the chef's special there.  I think I had raw lobster.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't ever eat raw lobster.  It's disgusting.  No, doesn't that screw you up?  Dude, it was so bad. 
[00:47:00]  And it was $300 for two of us.  Holy shit.  And we weren't really drinking.  I had a beer, I think, and she had a little wine, one glass each.  Yeah, I love that place.  We had the kid with us.  It was $300.  I'm like, this isn't $300 worth of good sushi.  The chef's special.  So they decide what you want to eat.  Yeah, they decide.  I don't like them deciding.  And then it's a sushi joint where they don't want you to use wasabi or soy sauce.  I use it.  Because they have special sauces on each of their fish.  Fuck that.  I say, where's the wasabi and soy?  I always ask for it. 
[00:47:30]  Bring it.  It was so bad, it was laughable.  We started laughing how bad my sushi tasted.  Wow.  And then I realized maybe I don't have a good palate.  Maybe I do like just basic shit.  I like to think I like exotic shit.  Yeah.  I love almost everything I've had there I love.  Really?  I should have went with the tuna special they have, where they have different tunas with different sauces.  Ah.  This thing was horrendous, man.  So I'm writing Jimmy.  I'm trying to make it hurt.  This sucks. 
[00:48:00]  Took your recommendation.  I was joking, obviously.  I was only joking.  I didn't even get it until the end, and finally, whatever.  Aw.  All right.  So you're with the monkeys down there on vacation.  With the monkeys.  That was just part of it.  The ship was great.  It was the Norwegian cruise line.  Epic.  Do you feel the thing moving?  Yeah.  So when you're sleeping and stuff?  Yeah.  It depends on the weather.  Sometimes you don't feel anything.  But coming into, I guess like coming into Nassau, we felt a little, yeah. 
[00:48:30]  It was rocking that night.  But you don't really get seasick, right?  No, no.  That shit is old school, isn't it?  I do get seasick on boats.  If I'm on a, let's say one of these charter fishing boats out of Long Island or something.  Well, of course.  And it's moving like that, I will get seasick.  But on a cruise ship, never got seasick.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Charter boat, Long Island, huh?  Yeah.  What?  Nothing.  Oh, shit.  You're on the short list, sir.  I've heard that. 
[00:49:00]  I've heard I'm on that serial killer short list.  Ronnie B put you on the short list.  You put me on the short list?  I had nothing to do with it, sir.  But now I'm hearing about a charter boat.  I'm going to have to report that to Ronnie.  Charter boat out there, I get seasick.  Charter boat, Long Island, huh?  Interesting.  And by C, he means the letter.  He hates women.  Did you go fishing?  I have been fishing.  Last time you were on a charter boat.  That was a long time ago.  How long ago?  Older than those fucking women were dead.  Longer than that. 
[00:49:30]  I'm sure.  I'll tell you that.  We all know we're going to know this fucker.  I'm telling you right now.  They're looking, I know.  I'm telling you right now.  I know if this guy isn't brought in with an O&A fucking homeless shopping spree shirt.  A fucking O&A party.  This serial killer thing is taking over Long Island.  I was at FH over the weekend.  Yeah.  They're all talking about it, too.  They're like, oh, it's got to be the guy that comes in on Tuesday nights and sits over there.  Everyone is trying to figure out who this person is.  We all have our theories around here on who it is.  Yeah.  It's creepy, man, because that's our area. 
[00:50:00]  When you go to the beaches, that's where we go.  That's where you go.  If you want to go to the ocean.  Aren't they predominantly hewis?  People don't seem to care about hookers.  Of course as much.  Yeah.  When serial killers are just getting hookers, they don't seem to care as much.  There was a five-year-old, though, in the pile.  Yeah, with a parent or something like that.  But I guess that's one of the hookers that brings the kid along for the ride.  That's cray-cray.  Here's why people don't care about hookers as much.  Because the randomness of serial killers is what makes them so scary. 
[00:50:30]  Yes.  And most of us are not hookers, so it's like we know, like, whew, okay, I'm not in the demo.  You're safe.  Yeah.  When it was the Son of Sam, people were freaking out.  Anybody.  Could have been anybody.  Most white people weren't scared of the Atlantic killers because it was all black so being killed.  Right.  Most of you're a demo.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  So you do get seasick.  Yeah, but not on these cruise ships.  They're so big and just fucking, they have, the shit these things have.  I love watching the shows. 
[00:51:00]  Sometimes at night, you're laying around.  Even a bad show is good on a cruise ship, right?  Eh, why not?  Not a show show, a TV show.  Oh, I thought you meant, you never went to?  No, I went to some of the shows.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but those are fun because they're so bad.  That's true.  A couple were really good.  One, I absolutely refused to go to.  But the, yes.  Um, but, uh, the, the ship itself, all the, the workings and gadgetry that keep it moving  and, and keep it stable and stuff are really amazing. 
[00:51:30]  These modern day cruise ships are sick.  Is it crowded?  Um, not where I was.  No, I understand that.  But when you were just kind of wandering around.  No, it wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  I think the economy's kept the, the people down.  I'm trying to talk, I'm trying to talk my girl into going just cause I've, we've never  been on, you know, a huge cruise ship.  I, I, I, I was on a cruise ship in, uh, the Greek islands, but that was a smaller ship.  They had nothing like what you had going.  This is, these are cool as fuck, man.  They got water slides on them and rock walls and all kinds of fucking bullshit going on. 
[00:52:00]  And then, and then we were in the villas called the villas and they're the big suites that  are on the bow, around the bow of the ship or just over the bridge.  And it's, uh, Sam get better pictures so I can follow along.  Yeah, I know.  Well, he's not just dance pictures.  Go to the, go to the official cruise site.  I want to, I want to see some pics.  The villas.  Sam's really terrible on the computer.  How many villas are there?  Um, the, the ones I had, there were two.  And then, uh, there are a few other ones around the perimeter, but then in the middle of all 
[00:52:30]  these is your own private area that the people with the, from the villas are the only ones  that could get into.  And that's got a pool area and a bar and how many people have access to other shit?  Um, just the people that are staying in the villas.  So yeah, around there.  And yeah, it's not crowded suite on the whole ship.  Yeah.  There's only two of them.  And that was it.  That's top of the line.  You can't go any higher.  Top of the line.  Wow.  How was the gym? 
[00:53:00]  Oh, it was, uh, wonderful.  Jacuzzi and stuff?  I did not go to the gym at all.  Why would you go to the gym?  I know, I, I, I, Keith and Ange went to the gym a couple of days.  I was like, you know what?  I'm on vacation.  My trainer's coming over today.  He's going to beat the shit out of me.  But I was like, fuck that.  And then the excursions.  Is he going to start by squeezing the alcohol out of you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about that?  Ring me out.  It's going to ring you out and then finally get to your workout.  Can you imagine?  I'm just going to give you a million bear hugs. 
[00:53:30]  Ring me out.  Please ring me out.  That's the ship.  Was there a lot of drinking?  Uh, yes.  Some days more than others.  Some days I just took, especially if I was doing an early excursion, I would try not to  drink so much.  That's a little crappy room.  My God.  What are you looking at?  That garbage.  Go to the villas.  You don't know how to work a computer.  You really don't, you villainous fool.  And, uh, yeah, the, uh, the excursions were enough exercise.  Believe me. 
[00:54:00]  We went on some, some long walking excursions and shit like that.  Uh, and then nothing is cuter than a dolphin.  I got to tell you.  I went to two dolphin excursions.  I do too.  Why?  He said, fuck you, you don't, you know what makes a dolphin cute?  A tuna net.  Didn't we talk about, didn't we talk, that's great.  A cove.  Oh, geez, it's a bloody red cove.  Exactly.  Hey, give me that fucking flipper, idiot.  Just slice his flipper off and kick him in the cunt. 
[00:54:30]  Back to the water, fruit.  Did we talk about the dolphins when you were here?  Before you went away?  Where it's all, it's a, it's bullshit.  They don't, there's no real interaction going on between you and the dolphins.  Yes.  Really?  Yeah.  It's the trainer behind you with the fish making it do all this stuff, and I'm thinking  it actually wants to say hi to me.  You think it's, it's on its side, flipping its flipper, waving.  Yes, I want to think that.  That he's actually waving to you?  But it just moves the trainer moves.  I pretty much, uh, I was on to that.  To make you feel like you're having a real interaction with a fucking fish. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I was, he's not a fish, he's a mammal, he's very intelligent.  Is he in the water?  Yeah.  He's a fish.  He's a fish.  He's a fish with a vagina on his back.  Stupid assholes.  What a dumb fucking thing that is.  They were great.  Blow hole.  I want to throw a dolphin into Jell-O and watch him suffocate in deliciousness.  Spice them.  I was all in with dolphins until I fucking went on one of those, uh, excursions.  Well, listen.  And then swim out there and he's going to bring you back in.  He's bringing you back in because he wants more fish from the trainer that's on the fucking 
[00:55:30]  shoreline.  That's how they train him, you know?  You gotta, you gotta kind of, uh, you know.  I want to think that he really thought I was drowning and he's pushing me back into shore.  Nah, that ain't it.  I know.  So go ahead.  We went to two.  Wow.  We went to two, uh, of these excursions.  One in Mexico, which was just a ghetto ass fucking poor couple of dolphins in a pond.  What, what fish was it?  And they said it was a dolphin.  Yeah.  Right.  It's a big fucking trout. 
[00:56:00]  I don't know what this was, but no, no real interaction at all.  They like, yeah, you know.  Wait, do you go in the pond?  Yeah.  You go in there and you stand on this little ledge thing against the wall.  Yeah.  And then the little guy comes around and you pet him.  Oh yeah.  And shit.  That's the crap I did.  No, it was the shitty one.  All right.  So maybe I should redo this.  It was the ghetto one.  And then I have this, uh, underwater, uh, camera case, you know, and you put, uh, your  Canon HD, uh, video camera in there and you can put it under the water.  Bloop, bloop. 
[00:56:30]  And I'm fucking taking some underwater, uh, shots.  That's awesome.  Until the guy goes like, oh, the dolphin, uh, does not know what that is.  So you cannot use it in the water here.  I'm like, all right.  What am I going to fucking argue dolphin with the guy?  Dolphin's looking at it.  It was all cute and everything.  His little dolphin face is right in the camera looking at this thing.  Like he's freaking out.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Fucker.  Should have let me continue doing it.  It was fun.  Yeah.  What is the dolphin going to do to you?  Nothing.  Might try to fuck you to death.  Yeah.  Well, they do that with girls on there, period. 
[00:57:00]  Do they?  There's a few videos that are hysterical where boyfriend's trying to save his girlfriend.  This bottle nose is just trying to shove his bottle nose.  Is there an actual video of this?  Yeah.  Please find that.  Right up a vagina.  Fuck the stupid cruise pictures.  Yeah.  Get that fucking, uh, dolphin trying to, trying to nose the, the girl's vagina.  He probably, he's trying to, probably push, he probably thinks she's dying.  He's probably trying to push her to shore.  Yeah.  She's bleeding.  I have to help this woman.  He thinks a great white grabbed her crotch.  Her fucking brains are leaking out. 
[00:57:30]  Dolphin eats pussy is the, uh, is the title.  Yeah, but this only has 4,000 views.  How good could this be?  I don't know.  There, now, now the dolphin's swimming around.  He's, he's, he's down there.  They're in little, uh, they got some, some fins on.  Oh, what are they snorkeling with dolphins?  That would be cool.  Yeah.  Well.  That would be really cool.  But that's what I got to do.  Fuck.  See, that's the one that didn't land.  All right.  I could accept that.  Yeah.  Now the dolphin's swimming around.  All right, guys.  Keep talking. 
[00:58:00]  And when we get to the actual.  How long is this video?  Yeah.  Fucking endless.  Get to the, get to the part where he's spearing her vagina.  Exactly.  With his bottle nose.  There, see?  Now he, look, look.  Oh, yeah.  He wants that fucking pussy.  Oh, my God.  Ah, the dolphin's totally trying to get, ah, ha, ha, ha.  That's great.  She's trying to slam her legs shut and push the dolphin away.  This dolphin wants her pussy so bad.  Exactly.  Nice.  They got a rod?  Does dolphin have a rod?  It does.  Look, it's going to fuck her.  Oh, my God.  He has a fucking dolphin. 
[00:58:30]  Dolphin's dicks are not even that big.  Ha, ha, ha.  Now, look, and his boyfriend's like, hey, hey, you.  Cut blocker.  Ah, ha, he gets right in there.  You're in his environment.  And someone's filming this whole thing.  Why doesn't the boyfriend punch the dolphin?  Dolphin has a rod.  I'd jerk him off.  Ha, ha, ha.  Now the dolphin's trying to poke the guy in the dick.  What the fuck?  Trying to get to the, trying to get to her vag, her vagina.  Well, that's a hell of an excursion.  Yeah, that's fun.  Yeah, you don't want that.  Get raped by a fucking animal.  A dolphin rape excursion is not fun. 
[00:59:00]  But it will cost you extra.  Who's got the camera and why aren't they helping?  See, if I saw this happening and I didn't know those people, you'd get perfect footage  like this, too.  Yeah, of course, you're right.  I wouldn't help.  You're right.  But he is bottlenosing right up her fucking rod.  Oh, God, he's right in there.  That was penetration.  I think that bottlenose is pretty thick.  And then he's going for, look.  What a cock blocker.  That dolphin really wants some.  Wow.  And no one helps.  No, no, no one's helping.  Can't they just get out of the water?  It looks like it's a pool.  It looks, no. 
[00:59:30]  It looks shallow.  Yeah, I think he's trying to protect it.  Like, if they try to swim away, he's definitely fucking her.  Well, what happened?  Now, the footage ended.  What an idiot.  Just ends his stupid video.  Dolphin probably fucked the guy with the camera right in the mouth.  So the second one at Atlantis, you've got to do this.  By the way, excuse me.  Do you know how bad your pussy must smell for a sea animal to notice it in the ocean?  Oh, my God.  Do you know the scent coming off your vagina for it to be picked up underwater?  Jesus Christ. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, it was, the ghetto one was in Mexico.  And then the Nassau, Bahamas, Paradise Island, over there at Atlantis, that's a huge complex.  Got a bunch of different sections and stuff.  Man-made cove, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Man-made, little cove.  Checked that out last year.  They got a lot of nice dolphins in there.  And then you do the whole dolphin experience thing where you don't just stand there and watch them do tricks and stuff.  You get to actually swim around with them. 
[01:00:30]  They give you these little power motor little things in your hands.  And you go.  That's awesome.  And you get a snorkel and the fins and a mask.  And you go around underwater with them and touch them.  And then you give them a little kiss like that.  You get a picture where you give them a little kiss.  You don't like that?  I got one of those pictures.  Yeah, I know.  I'll post mine if you post yours.  Then do you get the one where you put your arm on the bottom and the top of them and he kind of bends up and smiles and does that? 
[01:01:00]  No, my dolphin was lazy.  No, I got a great one.  I got the kiss one, though.  I'll tell you one weird thing, though.  Because, you know, you think of it as a fish because it's kind of swimming around in the water.  It's got fishy little arms and a fishy fin on its back.  But when you look at a little dolphin's eyes, it's got that mammal thing going on.  You know, when you look in a dog's eyes, it's like, yeah, this thing's thinking.  You look in a dolphin's eyes, you're like, yeah, he's thinking.  You're right.  There's stuff going on.  You're right.  He flips water at the trainer.  It's like, and then they talk. 
[01:01:30]  They go, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You throw them fish.  They're constantly throwing them fish.  It's all about the fish.  That's how they train them.  You can't train them without the fish.  Of course not.  They love that fish.  But they let you go in the cove without anybody really with you?  Well, yeah, there's an instructor.  There's a trainer in there with it.  And then they put you on this boogie board thing.  And you lay out there in the middle of the cove.  And then they go, okay, now put your feet together and just hold on. 
[01:02:00]  You go, oh, man.  And this bottlenose dolphin takes his little bottlenose, tucks it right on your foot,  and then just swims really fucking fast, heads you right toward a wall,  and then goes off at the last second, and it just glides slowly in.  Oh, they trust the dolphins to do the right thing?  Yeah.  It's crazy.  See, that's what you do.  You go around with those things, and you swim around with the dolphins.  What's that thing he's holding on to?  It propels you.  It's a sea dude. 
[01:02:30]  It goes, and then he pulls you through, so you ain't got to really swim.  See, Jimmy, you don't do things.  Dolphins are faster than they are.  There's another thing you could be doing.  What, fucking watching some chick I'm with get raped in a fucking animal with an average heart on?  Jimmy doesn't do things.  No, I don't.  You know what I do?  I fucking watch Ozzy on YouTube.  That's fun to me.  That's what I like doing.  That's it.  Defend your things.  I like to watch Ozzy on YouTube and fucking videos of people holding hornets.  Other people would rather watch their chick getting almost raped by himself. 
[01:03:00]  Exactly.  It was assault.  An assault.  Exactly.  It was assault.  All that dolphin needed was a fucking sideways baseball hat.  Jesus.  So that was it for the dolphins?  Yeah, the dolphin pretty much sums that up.  The Mexican one was real ghetto.  Yeah.  And the one in Atlantis was cool.  And the one in Atlantis was good.  Hey, you walk around Atlantis?  Yeah.  I was there a little over a year ago at this point, and it was a lot of under construction. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, it's fucking, it's great.  They got their shit together again?  I went down there for vacation a few times, and I would absolutely go back again.  The new tower with the adult pool rules.  Over at the Cove.  Yeah, they call it the Cove.  The Cove.  Right, right.  It's a place.  That area's really nice.  No kids allowed, Uncle Paul.  Not allowed.  I hate the Cove.  But the rest of the place was a little shaky.  Really?  They were doing a lot of construction last time I was down there.  Building it up.  Is Atlantis Mexico or no?  No, it's Bahamas.  Bahamas. 
[01:04:00]  You would like Atlantis.  I would definitely go there.  Oh, that's nice.  Jimmy, you would like Atlantis.  You're nuts to go to Mexico.  I wouldn't go near Mexico right now.  I went to, yeah, it was.  Fuck that.  We took an ATV ride through the jungles of Mexico.  And it was, like, I thought, all right, this is going to be, you know, ATV.  And I heard people going like, oh, ATV sucks.  You know, you take you on the street.  It's this, that, or the other.  Why do ATVs suck?  Because people were saying, like, they take you out and it's just like with a guide on 
[01:04:30]  the street and you barely go anywhere.  That wasn't this one.  I went to the ghetto one also where you just go out on the street.  What were you doing?  One ghetto, one real?  Yeah, it seemed to be that way.  Anyway, we went through jungles that were like, and I'm on the bus as they're taking  us out there.  And I'm just looking at some of these people going, you're 500 fucking pounds.  You're not going to be able to do this.  And I was right.  They're just putzing along.  So sometimes the guide would have to stop and wait. 
[01:05:00]  I'm doing it.  And she turns into, like, into some bushes.  And then the guide has to tell her how to put it in reverse.  And I'm just like.  And bumps that were crazy.  I hate going with other people.  I was catching what they call fat air.  Fat air.  That's the worst part of excursions.  You have to go with other people.  Yeah, yeah.  I hate that more than anything.  And these bitches wouldn't shut up for a second on the bus.  They just.  And then I was talking to my father.  And he has a tumor. 
[01:05:30]  And he was like, shut the fuck up for a second.  Can I look out the window at the majesty of a fucking rainforest without your fat fucking  face just talking?  God, are they annoying.  Ugly American.  How long was the bus ride?  About three minutes.  Yeah, three minutes.  No.  It was a good over a half hour, 40 minutes.  Wow.  And how many people on the ship?  On the ship, there's thousands.  Thousands.  So they got to just get a bus for thousands of people? 
[01:06:00]  No, no, no.  It's only the people that want to do this one excursion.  Jimmy takes thousands of people on ATVs.  We'll all go on the ATVs.  Sorry, you don't have a choice.  No, there's a shitload of excursions you can do wherever you are.  Some people don't leave the boat.  Some people just go to the beach.  You sign up for excursions.  They got like places set up all over the place.  This was about a bus.  I'd say there were probably 15 people on the bus.  That was it.  And they drive us out into the middle of this fucking Mayan ruins jungle.  You see the ruins? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Cool, right?  I don't know, there's some fucking, yeah, there's like some graves and shit that were  opened up and, yeah, really twisted stuff.  Was it two of you on one ATV or each on the road?  Nah, separate.  You could do two on one, but the separate.  It was so fucking treacherous and bumpy and like ruts and real holes and rocks that you're  going over.  It was fun as fuck.  And they don't allow that in America.  No, no.  This is the thing we talk about.  You get to do way cooler stuff when you're out of the country.  No, it's Mexico. 
[01:07:00]  They don't have lawyers involved.  Mexico.  It's like, good luck to you.  Here's your ATV.  There's a lot of ditches and shit out there.  It's like, believe me, that's the least that could happen.  That's true.  But I watch videos online of car accidents and wrecks.  And you know what you see?  Legs ripped off everywhere but here.  They're always in Brazil or Mexico.  Those horrible car accident videos.  They're everywhere where there's no lawyers.  Sometimes lawyers help.  Jimmy, you don't do stuff.  I love doing stuff.  That's the theme of this hour.  I love doing stuff.  What about an ATV?  What about it?  Would you do the ATV?  You see what happened to Ozzy? 
[01:07:30]  He almost died.  No, I wouldn't.  On an ATV.  So no zip line, no dolphins, and no ATV.  No, I don't fucking belong there.  So what do you do when you do stuff?  Depends.  I go to prisons.  Yes.  I went to the Mythbusters compound.  That's nice.  That's doing stuff.  I'm going to see God Bless Ozzy Osbourne next Sunday.  That's doing stuff.  That's his documentary.  Yes.  That's stuff.  I went and saw Robin Williams play this week.  How was it?  Very good.  I thought I was supposed to go with you.  What happened?  I just went.  It was last minute.  I'm going to see Chris Rock's play this week. 
[01:08:00]  I do a lot of stuff.  How was Robin Williams play?  It was interesting.  He's phenomenal.  Everyone in there is phenomenally well acted.  He's phenomenally well acted.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's about Iraq.  That means you didn't like it.  I did like it.  Because you're just talking about the acting.  Oh.  Well, that's the best part of it, is the acting.  Is it a funny play?  It's got humorous moments, but it's not a comedy.  It's a drama.  Why wouldn't Robin just do a...  He's a real actor.  He can do that.  He can do theater acting.  He's a Shakespearean actor.  Well, that is true.  Shut me down.  You're right. 
[01:08:30]  He went to Juilliard.  Remind me to talk about Spider-Man.  Oh, my God.  They shut it down.  That debacle.  Why?  But let's get back to him.  That was going so well.  We'll do all the stuff today.  So now you're ATVing, Mayan ruins.  ATVing in the jungle, Mayan ruins.  Dude.  Are you allowed to climb up the ruins?  The ruins.  Dude.  Yeah, you climb up some steps and shit.  And you see some rocks.  And you're just like, who put that rock there?  A long time ago.  It was a long time ago.  Someone put that rock there.  Yeah.  But do they have the people selling all the shit? 
[01:09:00]  No.  This is...  Dude, it's in the middle of nowhere.  This was one of the ones in the middle.  Yeah, this was one of those where there was nothing around.  It was really cool.  Is there homeless people hanging around or anybody?  No, not in the...  This was the middle of the jungle.  I was waiting for a cartel guy to come out and just blast us all.  That's why you're fucking crazy to go near Mexico.  The Mexican jungle right now?  Yes.  You're on your mind.  I know.  Believe me.  I thought about it.  But it was like, bah, what are you going to do?  And then we went to the...  Wait, wait, wait.  So what?  Is it all just growed in and stuff?  Yeah.  It's...  There are the trails that you're on.  Yeah, I got that. 
[01:09:30]  But other than that, yeah, there's nothing there but rainforests and trees and big iguanas  hanging out in the trees.  Oh, I'm jealous.  Fucking iguanas.  Did you check out iguanas, Jimmy?  No.  For what?  Fucking ugly lizards.  Oh, look.  He's sticking his tongue out again.  We got it.  That's what you do.  I'm a fly, faggot.  What would you rather do instead of look at an iguana?  Anything.  Anything.  Name a thing and I would rather do that.  Right now, the choices...  The world is your oyster. 
[01:10:00]  Name anything.  And that fucking trumps iguana by at least two things.  But you do things.  I love doing things.  Yeah, Jimmy does things.  I enjoy my life very much.  I know.  Travel a whole lot.  He's got a great life.  He does travel a lot.  Sure.  Constantly gone.  He just doesn't want to see an iguana.  I have no desire to see a giant fucking lizard.  No dolphins and no ATVs.  Exactly.  And no Mayan ruins.  The Mayan ruins, I would see if it wasn't for the fucking fact that people are being beheaded  in Mexico.  That's true.  That's kind of put the fucking kibosh on Acapulco in Mexico. 
[01:10:30]  I took my ATV to go see Sosa.  It's a jungle.  You get off the ATV and walk around the...  Yeah, yeah.  You go around and...  Can you go inside some of this shit a little bit?  No, you just kind of crawl up on them and stuff.  Okay.  There wasn't really anywhere to go inside.  And then the guy gives you a little history on it.  That's awesome.  Tells you what it was.  This is the Mayan temple of love and fertility.  It was used for the...  All right.  Come on.  Back to the bumps.  Exactly.  Stay out.  Get some air.  In 5,000 years, people are going to be walking through our apartments. 
[01:11:00]  How fucking horrible is that?  They're going to dock a ship on fucking the west side and people are going to walk through  our apartments.  Hey, this is where, you know, he would have friends come in who could have been men in dresses.  This is where they would put their big shoes.  I love all this shit, though.  One of our business.  Dude, the ruins.  Remember that one Bobby did?  That idiot looking for spirituality.  All we were doing were Chip and Bobby impressions.  Oh, good.  It's the same thing.  It was all...  Every time it was like, what time do we have to come back to the ship? 
[01:11:30]  What's that?  No.  The ship.  Stop it.  Every fucking two seconds.  Look at that.  It's a ruin.  Who ruined it?  Yeah, exactly.  Mayans.  Mayans.  Yorans.  Who's the...  I don't know.  We don't even know who this is no more.  Rainforest.  All about that.  And then Bobby with the Mayan ruins, dude.  And then, of course, because Keith and Ann went snooping.  Snooba, dude, you do your snooba. 
[01:12:00]  What is snooping?  It's a cross between snorkeling and scuba diving.  You don't know what this is?  No.  Bobby went off on this and how cool it was.  He must have been filling in for you, because it's one of the greatest hours of radio ever.  We ripped the shit out of Bobby.  I guess Jimmy was gone.  I was probably gone.  So when we were setting up to do this...  No, I don't think that's the one he did, is it?  Snooping.  What they do is they have this big kind of a flotation device thing, and they put scuba tanks on that. 
[01:12:30]  And then from that, a bunch of lines come down.  Okay.  And instead of having a scuba tank on your back, you breathe through a regulator from that air source.  Right.  So basically, it's like a puppet show.  You're all fucking...  Yes, a marionette.  But I didn't do that.  I was just snorkeling with the snuba people.  And I had the underwater camera, so I was able to take some pictures of the...  Some video of the snuba people. 
[01:13:00]  Keith and Anjan stuff.  And fish.  How far down can they go and snuba-ing?  They were down about 20 feet, I guess.  Somewhere around that.  And then with the snorkel, though, you can pretty much...  Unfortunately, you've got to breathe, so you've got to come back up.  But I was going down to the same level as the snuba people, holding on to shit, because I didn't have a weight belt.  So I'm grabbing this door off of the Edmund Fitzgerald, or whatever the fuck it was.  And I have the camera in one hand, and I'm trying to video a fish.  And you kind of get caught up in the moment where you're like, I want to get a good shot of that fish. 
[01:13:30]  And then you realize, I've got to fucking breathe.  And you look up and go, that's a long way up.  You can hold your breath that long?  I wonder if I'm going to make this.  Yeah, it's like...  And then I get up and be like...  I don't think...  You've got to blow the snorkel.  I got...  Just blow it out.  Yeah.  I can't hold my breath that long.  It was cool.  You can tell in the video when I'm trying to get down, because it gets all shaky.  It's so hard to fucking push yourself down.  And it's work, you know?  And you're like, you're not breathing, but you're working. 
[01:14:00]  And then you're grabbing onto something to keep yourself steadied.  So it was pretty fucking cool, though.  Do they bring their kids or no?  No, no.  See, sometimes you've got to do that.  You've got to just get away.  When are you going to post these videos?  Because I've got to see them.  I just got home Sunday.  But yeah, I'm going to start popping some of these up, because they're really cool.  I think I have a couple on this computer.  You'll probably take a look.  This is one of the computers that I actually took on Carry On.  So I'm able to have it.  I have a Windows computer that is in one of my bags. 
[01:14:30]  And anybody that wants to rifle through my bags, there's plenty of valuables.  Fantastic.  So the ATVs.  Baggage American Airlines.  The ATVs were good.  ATVs were good.  And then we went to more ATVs on St. Martin.  ATVs.  Which, oh my God.  Okay.  Good man, just go.  And then you're on the street.  You're on the street on these ATVs with fucking like tractor trailers in the other lane coming 
[01:15:00]  past you.  This ain't like the jungle.  Wow.  This isn't like the fun thing.  So where are you supposed to go?  He takes around to some shitty beach.  It looked like Crab Meadow on Long Island.  It was horrible.  You don't like Crab Meadow?  I hate Crab Meadow.  It stinks of seaweed low tide.  And there's no waves.  It's just these little ripples that come up.  And then you sit on this beach for a minute and then he's like, all right, everybody  load back up.  And you can't really get speed up and shit. 
[01:15:30]  I'm trying all kinds of things.  Like I'm fishtailing on the street just trying to have some fun.  And that was your second ATV ride?  Yeah, that was the second one.  Oh, that's a bummer because that takes away the first one when that happens.  No, it made me think, wow, that first one really ruled.  It was really cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, the second one was just kind of like, meh.  And the ATVs themselves were like street legal and not, they were like knockoffs.  The ones we have for the jungle, like massive shocks and like a two foot fucking travel  on the shocks and everything.  This one, it's like, all right, it's meant for the street. 
[01:16:00]  And I think they're trying to take the ATVs away from the people, right?  Especially on Long Island.  We could speak locally.  I mean, they don't watch a jet ski on Long Island anymore.  No.  And I think they're trying to make it harder to the ATV as well.  Yeah, and that was real ghetto because they were just taking us through the streets.  So we were just videotaping profound poverty.  It's amazing, the poverty in these countries.  And all I can think is like, this is literally paradise. 
[01:16:30]  You have beautiful beaches, a lot of land that isn't developed.  And I think Keith said this, this place, two words describe it, procrastination and like  laziness or just, just not, it was cinder blocks.  It's like guys went to work and said, let's build something.  And he, they, they put up some cinder blocks and then go, ah, fuck it. 
[01:17:00]  And then they go, let's leave.  And by the way, just leave the truck there too.  Abandonment.  That was it.  Abandonment and procrastination.  Why would you work if the beaches were so nice though?  But that's just it.  They could build these paradises.  They live in poverty.  What could they build?  A fucking resort, something.  No, the, the, the big guys from like America and Europe are doing that.  I don't know.  And then they're getting the locals to work there for no money.  Well, if the locals.  They can't figure that out.  Why can't the locals figure out how to build a resort kind of a thing? 
[01:17:30]  It doesn't even have to be a giant resort thing.  It could be something that's more than three cinder blocks and a tin roof selling tacos.  Isn't it nice to see that the resorts put a little money back into the island?  Oh God.  Doesn't matter what island you go to.  When you are off compound.  Wow.  Yeah.  You drive through the ghettos to get to the most amazing fucking resorts and realize  whoever owns those resorts takes their money with them.  Oh, they do not spread the wealth on those islands.  And you know, fuck them. 
[01:18:00]  They shouldn't.  These people live in, in what I say, like paradise.  You think they're sad though?  Oh, I've seen, we will pass them by people.  I've seen nothing but happy locals when I go on vacation.  What is this guy doing?  One guy just stood there and, and we went by and he goes, hey, and he held a fish up.  He just goes, hey.  And other people are just sitting on their patios and porches, just looking at traffic,  doing nothing.  But they're not sad.  I couldn't tell.  There was no expression.  They probably have it easy. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  I'm sure they're thrilled to fucking live in the shit houses they live in and watch fucking  fat tourists zip by on ATVs.  Do you get to see blue water like that?  That's what they get to see every day.  How about you build something nice?  That's all they get to see is blue water.  Blue water's nice, but it's not all you can see.  It gets old after a while.  How about you build something nice?  They don't know how to do that.  And you use it to make money for the island and yourself and, and what have you, you know? 
[01:19:00]  That part was getting me kind of a little, eh.  Like Nassau, right?  Nassau has a thriving little metropolis that's probably one block by one block.  And then the rest is shit.  But that middle part, it's wonderful.  They got banks and companies and Atlantis.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That should be an amusement park ride.  Bad?  Wow.  Yeah.  It's just total poverty.  Yeah.  It's, uh, the, the poverty is just astounding. 
[01:19:30]  And, uh, you know, of course you got to show your ID to get back on the ship.  Cause I guess they don't want people piling on where there's, you know, Hey, it's our food.  It's our beer.  What are you doing?  But it was, uh, all in all, just a great, great time.  Two fucking weeks in the Caribbean.  I was like a pirate.  It's fantastic.  You didn't go where they are, right?  Where?  You wouldn't know where there's pirates.  Nah, nah.  Nah, that's Caribbean.  What, what, what islands did you hit in two weeks? 
[01:20:00]  Do you remember?  Oh my God.  Give me the, give me the quick list.  Uh, yeah, St. Martin, uh, St. Thomas, um, Cozumel, eh, somewhere else, like Honduras.  And then, uh, uh, uh, well, it's, uh, Nassau.  Uh.  And when do they take off?  Like dinner time?  And then you wake up?  Yeah, around there.  And then you wake up in another area?  Yeah, you go, you, you go there all, all day.  You spend all day, like, where they stop, and, um, then you get back on the ship, and 
[01:20:30]  the ship leaves, you have dinner, you go to the casino, uh, you win money until the, you  know, last couple of days that you're on the ship, and then you, you pretty much give it  all back.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy, did I have a bad, bad, uh, couple of days there.  I was doing really well.  Well, you tweeted the one picture with the cash?  Yeah.  I, I saw that, and I just, oh, there it is.  That's a good one.  And I shook my head, I'm like, he won that way too early in his trip, that's not good.  And that wasn't near what I won. 
[01:21:00]  Really?  Oh, yeah, that was crazy.  You gave most of it back.  You gave a lot of it back, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Were you, were you being cranky at the casino?  Uh, a couple of times.  For the most part, though, I was doing well, so I wasn't being cranky.  I was, I, they loved me.  I was Mr. Anthony to everybody.  And apparently the casino staff are the same people that work at, like, some of the restaurants  are the same people that, like, do the mustard drill with the life jacket thing, and the  same people that are out showing you where the excursions are.  So every day, it was like, hello, Mr. Anthony, hello, Mr. Anthony, Mr. Anthony, Mr. Anthony. 
[01:21:30]  Everybody, and I'm throwing money around like Ralph Cramden.  I didn't care, I'm tipping this one and that one.  And they treat you, when you tip these motherfuckers early on, you are treated like royalty.  That's the way to do it.  So you throw out a shitload of money at the beginning, and whatever you need, like, I was  able to call my concierge, and, uh, if it was seven o'clock, I'd be like, I want a dinner 
[01:22:00]  reservation for four at whatever restaurant I wanted it at, uh, at eight o'clock.  And they're like, all right, whatever you need.  And then, you know, there's a line of people waiting to get in, and you're just like, all  right, thank you.  So, now, the food on the ships is supposed to be pretty good, right?  Yeah, yeah, it's really good.  What, would they have, like, a lot of snacks all over the place?  All over the fucking place.  It's snack city.  I would love that.  And then there's a shitload, see, uh, uh, Norwegian is different than Royal Caribbean. 
[01:22:30]  Norwegian's more like, do what you want to do.  So, uh, Royal Caribbean sets up, like, the main dining room and has these shifts of very  elegant dinners and stuff like that.  And then they have buffets and other things.  Uh, this, uh, the Epic had a shitload of great restaurants.  You want Japanese tapenaki?  Or you want steakhouse, Italian, whatever, Japanese, the noodle bar, fucking, just a shitload  of great restaurants.  And this is all floating. 
[01:23:00]  I know!  I don't get it!  I don't get it!  Sometimes we were sitting there eating at a fine restaurant and you look around and  go, we're in a boat in the middle of somewhere.  I don't get that.  I will never get that.  It's just in the middle of the fucking ocean.  And you're just, the amenities are amazing.  Like, when you're on a boat and you're with a bunch of buddies and you got some rods and...  What?  I had to stop so I could enjoy that.  Maybe you could have put that in a different way.  Three guys on a rowboat, maybe?  You got rods and you got some bait.  Yeah.  Jimmy's my Jewish friend.  Is that a commercial for racism? 
[01:23:30]  And I understand that you're on a boat.  Yeah.  But when you're looking around, there's a sushi chef.  I know.  We're hearing the clinging of silverware on China.  It doesn't make sense to me.  And it's just, it was great.  Great food.  Would a week be enough time?  Yeah, yeah.  A week is plenty of time.  You should do a cruise.  I've thought of it, but my days have to be used for other stuff.  Oh, my God.  Other stuff.  It was really fucking cool.  And the, like, you tip the fucking butler guy? 
[01:24:00]  Holy shit.  Every day when we came in from the excursion, our table was set with, like, little sandwiches  and fruit all over the place and drinks and whatever the fuck else you want.  And then I hosted a little cocktail party for all our guests.  I was like, could you please, concierge, could you please send an invite out to everybody  and have him?  And then I went over with a butler.  Yes, I need some of this and that.  Oh, Jesus.  And I had a little cocktail party.  For how many people?  I guess it was about 12 people. 
[01:24:30]  Who showed up?  It was everybody from our party.  My aunt and uncle, mom, dad.  Oh, you had more family there?  Yeah, yeah.  Dawn, Patrick.  Oh, okay.  My cousin Anthony.  Yeah.  We had a lot of people down there.  It was a great time.  With that many people.  It was fun, man.  So, it sounds like fun.  Like, I would love to do it for a week.  I think two weeks would drive me nuts.  Yeah, two weeks.  You could get a lot done in a week.  A fucking first class trip week.  I would love to try that once in my life.  Go top of the line for a week. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, I would.  And you'd fucking love it.  Starbucks on the ship?  Yeah.  Nice.  Like, it looks like a regular Starbucks?  Yeah.  And that's floating.  Yeah, they got that.  Can you get snacks late, though?  Anytime.  Ooh.  Anytime you want.  Isn't it pretty much all you can eat on these cruise ships?  Oh, fuck yeah.  So, you're just wandering around eating whenever you want.  There are certain things that are completely...  Do you feel fat right now?  I do feel a little pudgy.  I did put on a little.  That's why the trainer's coming over today to... 
[01:25:30]  To ring you out.  Start this...  Yeah, it's going to ring you out.  Start this over again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, what are you going to say?  All right.  Well, if anything else pops, you got to let us know.  Yeah.  I think we covered your cruise, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Sounds like a great time.  Yeah, it's just one of those fun fucking things.  And then you got to come back and deal with no luggage and fucking dumb broads texting you.  Right?  Shut up, you fucking freak.  Can we get into that? 
[01:26:00]  Oh, of course we can.  I had had it.  You got any voicemails?  No, no.  The voicemails, unfortunately, stopped, but I think that's because I was playing them on the air.  Right.  But the texts have quadrupled.  Can we do that after the break?  Oh, yeah.  Are you happy to see me and Jimmy?  Oh, yes.  It was a...  Well, you were doing all that long.  Me and Jimmy stared at each other for two weeks off and on.  It's fun.  We had fun, though.  No, we had a good time.  You were missed because we loved you.  Oh, thank you.  It was fun.  We had some good days.  Yeah, I think so.  We definitely enjoyed ourselves. 
[01:26:30]  Was that me going back to my shitty seat?  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  All right, we'll break, get into some other things, maybe more stories from Ant's vacation.  There's a picture of Anthony and Coach, and believe me, that looks more right than the  first one you Twittered.  Of course it does.  That fucking hat you have on and your fucking white trash hard liquor t-shirt.  It's where you belong.  I certainly do.  Road 23, sir.  Of course.  D.  And, boys, we are going to be doing some ziplining. 
[01:27:00]  Where?  Extreme Adirondacks.  Adirondacks.  Oh, man.  You guys have fun ziplining.  Thanks for that on Twitter, whoever you are.  You have fun.  You're not going to zipline.  I'm not going to zipline.  I like the zipline.  I like watching the zipline people.  They were fun to watch.  So you wouldn't zipline.  I don't think I zipline.  You were lying.  No, no.  I just don't have an urge to zipline.  Are you scared?  I don't think I'm scared of ziplining.  I just don't want to zipline.  Oh, you fight anyone on vacation.  That's coming in.  Any fights?  Let me think. 
[01:27:30]  There was no real fights.  You do understand French guy underwater fight now, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  People do get kind of mixed up and tangled up.  When you have to deal with other people.  Shit like that.  But I had everything.  I got a little creeped out at one point with the camera.  I took the camera and I was pretty far out.  Pretty far the fuck out.  And I'm like, this is cool.  And then I realized I could kind of see what's going on in front of me. 
[01:28:00]  But if something just came out from the side or behind me, I'm so dead.  And then I started getting this paranoid, like something was creeping up on me feeling.  And so I turn around and I look.  I pop back up.  I take a look and I'm really far off ashore.  And I'm like, I want to get back there.  And then you almost start panicking, like I'm not getting there fast enough.  So you just bloop, go under.  And then you notice my flippers are really flippin'.  Like I'm really fucking, get me out of here. 
[01:28:30]  Because I start looking behind me.  It's like, there's nothing around me.  Wait, where were you?  Nah, in the bathtub.  No, were you in the cove?  No, no, no.  This wasn't the cove.  This was out in the...  Don't ever go scuba diving.  Well, scuba diving will freak you out because you get a lot deeper and look into an abyss.  Well, yeah.  Well, it turns to Caicos where it drops all the way down.  Yeah, oh, God.  And they let you go over the edge a little bit, you know, because I'm still doing with the  Oh, Jesus.  But then when you look into that just black water that you know goes for thousands of miles. 
[01:29:00]  That's what started freaking me out.  Not that I never looked into an abyss like that.  And then you turn around and it's all like, oh, okay, I see coral and stuff.  But that darkness will scare the shit out of you.  But I was looking as far as I could and it was like, holy shit.  If something comes out of there, it'll be so fast I won't be able to see it.  You know what?  It's similar.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  The two are very similar.  I'm going to fight them off with a camera housing.  I always picture that there's just a massive fucking whale that is just out of sight underwater. 
[01:29:30]  And that if you saw like a glimpse of it, just a glimpse, you'd be like...  I would drop dead.  I know.  You'd die right there.  I would drop dead.  Massive whale, would you think it was one of our live events?  That's good.  You didn't go for the other room.  Oh, I knew you, Rock.  I didn't even think of it.  You got SeaWorld right next to you.  Oh, shit.  You gotta fucking go with the listener joke.  He's behind the glass.  Tap on it.  No distress signal had been sent. 
[01:30:00]  I'll never put on a kid's shirt again.  We'll break here.  By the way, I need someone to get me into some of those buildings in Kings Park.  Oh, the psychiatric center?  Yeah.  Who's going to do this for me?  Kings...  What are they, old buildings?  Oh, there they are.  I was showing you at the pictures before the show today.  Kings Park Psych Center that closed down a while ago. 
[01:30:30]  Very creepy.  The main building finally closed down in 96, but most of the place has been closed down  a lot longer than that.  And you drive around this place, it is fucking creepy.  And then, because I posted it over the weekend, someone...  Someone...  I should repost it today.  There's a website.  A guy went all over Chernobyl.  That's fucked up.  Oh, really?  Going in and out of buildings, and complete towns that are just obviously deserted, and  old schools, and factories, and I don't know, a whole bunch... 
[01:31:00]  This one site has hundreds and hundreds of pictures on it.  It's just amazing.  Do you know about that city in Pennsylvania?  It was a mining town, and there's a fire under the town.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they had to abandon it.  And then the coal was on fire.  Oh, whatever it is.  There's no way to put it out.  It can't be put out, and so they abandoned the whole town.  It's like...  Yeah, yeah.  That's shit.  150 miles from here.  My girl doesn't understand.  I'm like, I love that stuff.  I would love to explore it in these buildings that have been abandoned years ago. 
[01:31:30]  Not in Chernobyl, I would.  I would love to go to old train stations.  Yeah.  That show, Cities of the Underground, oh, my God.  I love all of that.  Yeah.  So we've been trading websites all weekend long of other places.  This is like a ghost town.  I got to do my research for you.  Continue.  But someone sent me a website about just a little ghost town in the middle of the Midwest  that they had abandoned.  And they call it the most toxic place in America or something like that. 
[01:32:00]  Same thing, an old baseball field that hasn't been used in years and houses and schools.  You ever see where they make these reservoirs and they had to abandon towns and they just  dam off these areas and pour water in for a reservoir?  And divers have been in there and there's like streets and telephone poles and houses  under fucking water.  Is there a website for that?  There's got to be.  Wait, where's that?  I don't know why I just repeated your question.  I think there was one up in upstate New York.  Seriously?  Yeah, I've heard about these places.  Why do they get abandoned? 
[01:32:30]  Because there was a government project years ago where it's like, hey, we're building a  reservoir here.  Get the fuck out.  And they tell them to get the fuck out and they just load it up of water, dam it off,  load it up.  And then underwater, you could see like these streets, a little town underwater.  Everybody has umbrellas there, right?  Please find that video.  Someone had to have made a video of that.  Very cool.  All right, we can talk about that a little more after the break too.  Someone's got to get me into the Kings Park buildings. 
[01:33:00]  Or I'll just do it myself.  What's the ticket on that?  What did it get you for?  Trespassing.  That's about it?  Yeah, not criminal, right?  Night in jail, possibly?  Maybe.  Yeah, probably something like that.  Night in jail.  Night in jail, Suffolk County.  I could handle that.  As long as it's not the tombs.  You've got some good pictures.  Yeah, for the story?  Why not?  Sure.  All right, we'll break here.  Stay there.  Good evening, cool cats.  The Blue Room would like to welcome back Mr. Andy Rooney and his weekly beef. 
[01:33:30]  Today's cool riff, Vacation.  You ever notice when you come back to a hotel and you forgot to check out,  your stuff's thrown all over the front lawn?  You ever have that happen?  And it's embarrassing stuff, like black dildos and men's magazines with all men in them.  You ever have that happen?  Your Eros is spilled all over your luggage.  You ever notice when your flight to Somalia is delayed, your vacation starts late? 
[01:34:00]  You ever watch a clitoral circumcision on the beach?  My idea of relaxing is to watch some red tube and see a girl pink sock while a large gentleman  dog fucks her.  You ever see a girl pink sock and then he pushes it back in?  That's fun.  When I was a kid, booyah was something you yelled at a rival baseball player.  Now it's something you yell when your testicles are in the hiney of a runaway.  Don't you hate when you want to go on vacation and your family points you to a cemetery and 
[01:34:30]  they say, go ahead, pop, sleep by this headstone.  Do you ever notice how embarrassing that is?  Give it up for Mr. Andy Rooney, ladies and gentlemen.  Y'all come back next week for more of Mr. Andy Rooney.  You ever notice that diapers never fit the way they're supposed to when you're an adult?  Provided he don't shit himself again.  Sirius XM, the virus. 
[01:35:00]  I thought we had a website for that reservoir.  Yeah.  Where there's like a little town underwater, but no.  Where they built some shit.  They built some shit.  They don't build shit.  They flooded the shit that was built already.  Shit was built.  But people all over Twitter are saying there's a bunch of these all over the country.  Yeah, they just decided to tell the people, get out.  We're filling up your town with water.  Yeah, look, a little town like that.  And then they just fill it up with water. 
[01:35:30]  Say, fuck you.  Well, I want to see the water part.  I say, yeah, go fuck yourself.  Is it all water?  Is it underwater?  Or just a little water?  That is now.  That's the town?  So why aren't they fucking going underwater so we can see what it looks like?  I don't want to see from the air.  Back when they had like, you know, those big diving bells.  Ah, yes, let's take a look, shall we?  True.  Oh, I also forgot to mention on the cruise, the night of watching gay porn. 
[01:36:00]  What?  The night of watching gay porn.  Yeah, just wanted to clear that up.  Okay.  What?  Where were we going?  Why did you do that?  Oh.  Oh.  There needs to be a why, Jim?  Oh.  See, thank you, thank you.  It wasn't like that.  It was worse than that.  It was worse than that.  Was it you and Keith watching while the girls were out playing Pinochle?  No, no, no.  You guys just got into the comforter?  Not at all. 
[01:36:30]  You said it was worse than that, so we...  Yeah, yeah.  We panned down, is it now?  That's probably on par.  Okay.  And it was video.  Why were you watching gay porn?  Gay porn.  Because on the ship, they don't have many good TV shows.  You got that E channel.  So it was either the Rockford Files or ass-fucking sophomores.  Or gay porn.  Wow, look at that guy on the end.  He's a happy fella.  See, I prefer the guy in the middle, but that's just me.  The guy in the fucking...  It looks too much like Travolta holding it on the left in the face. 
[01:37:00]  Come on, Sam.  Turn that.  Stop hogging it.  And then young Michael Douglas on the right.  Eric.  Look, yeah, yeah.  Gay porn.  But now you've got to find the gay porn.  And this is kind of how it was done.  And when you go on the computer on a ship, you're using a network that the entire ship  is using, pretty much.  Sure.  You've got to watch to have your shared items turned on or off.  Because you can pretty much see who's logged on their computer.  And a lot of times you can snatch some shit right out of people's computers. 
[01:37:30]  Shared items?  So, yeah.  Yeah.  This one gentleman from Australia had everything open.  That you saw this guy during the day?  Walking around?  Not sure who it was.  We know his name and everything.  But he was within your area?  Yeah.  Had to be.  Had to be close.  Oh, my God.  How do you know what your shared items are?  Yeah.  No, no.  It's just because of my photos.  Exactly.  You've got to just shut that shit off. 
[01:38:00]  Shut shared off.  Just shut everything off.  Yeah.  Don't share anything.  And there was, don't access sensitive websites on public Wi-Fi.  Well, that's somebody.  That's a great idea there.  So, there's this guy.  And it turns out he's probably in his mid-40s.  He's married.  Has a kid.  Why?  Because you can see his other pictures?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You can see everything else.  Oh, my God.  You can see one PDF file he had on how to save your marriage. 
[01:38:30]  That was in there.  Oh, my God.  And then we found the folder.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  The folder with two young gents.  What were their names again?  I keep forgetting their names.  Let me see.  It'll pop up here in a second.  Yes.  Todd and Jamie.  Oh, Todd and Jamie.  Todd and Jamie.  They're good eggs, Jamie.  They really are.  They're terrific.  Todd and Jamie were in this folder. 
[01:39:00]  And when you clicked on it, oh, goodness, what Todd and Jamie were doing.  In one scene, I believe it was Todd was behind a desk doing something.  And Jamie walked in and said, what are you doing?  He goes, I'm hanging out.  My dad should be coming soon.  It was teen gay porn.  I think they were all over 18.  But it was teen gay porn.  All of them.  All of this guy had was teen gay porn.  Jesus.  And then the guy goes.  By the way, if not to interrupt you, under how to save a marriage, did it say, throw out 
[01:39:30]  folder called Todd and Jamie?  I guess.  That should have been number one.  Maybe start there.  Yeah.  So we're watching it.  And then the guy goes, well, your father's coming home soon.  He goes, well, you know, you could get in trouble, though, in that amount of time.  And the guy goes, what kind of trouble do you mean?  And the guy just leans over and starts, you know, sucking his dick.  Well, that's trouble.  It sure is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they're sucking dick.  And then one guy decided he wanted to get fucking the ass.  So the guy was like pounding his ass, just pounding it. 
[01:40:00]  And then they put their clothes on.  And, you know, the guy's dad was coming home.  You don't want to catch him like that.  It's very embarrassing.  And then we did a little more investigating into what this guy did.  Oh, no.  Apparently, he works in Australia.  He runs a company for wayward children between 12 and 17 years old.  Getting them homes and making sure they're all set up and not starving. 
[01:40:30]  And, yeah, we were like, okay, all right, this motherfucker is what a dirty man.  Huh?  Huh?  Yeah.  So every time we were up on the top deck and we heard an Australian accent, I'd be like,  ah, you see, Toten Jamie?  And see if the guy turned around.  But we could not find who this guy was.  Think he left his thing open on purpose so other guys would hook up?  Or it was just he didn't know? 
[01:41:00]  No, I don't think he knew.  I don't think he knew.  We were looking.  And it was loaded with porno.  Loaded with gay porno.  I wonder if anybody's ever gotten busted with kiddie porn that way.  I bet you people have.  I'm sure.  I bet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The only one that was almost not gay was two guys and this girl was in the bathtub.  And, uh, but then the guys are just blowing each other while the girl fingers herself.  And it's like, what's going on?  It's like, you got the girl right there. 
[01:41:30]  What's happening here?  What are you doing?  You silly goose.  And one guy's like squeezing her tit, but he's, he's jerking the other guy off.  It's like, what is that?  That's just greedy.  That's fucking crazy.  Yeah.  Like, what's that?  That's a little weird.  I don't like the fucking laxadaisical look on the guy's face.  This one guy blowing another guy.  And he's just kind of, it looks like he's fucking smoking a pipe.  What a gentleman the guy fucking laying back is.  Yeah.  You know how?  Yeah.  He's like holding a fucking corncob pipe.  Hold the bottom of that big fucking pipe.  And that guy's solving a murder. 
[01:42:00]  That guy's dick looks broken.  Well, yeah, it probably is.  He's pounding away on tight bungholes.  He could crack it.  He's holding those balls.  You can always hear him going, meh.  Hey, meh.  You should search the room org.  The room org.  There's a certain section of our audience that wants you to talk a lot slower right now.  Oh, really, huh?  There's a few.  I ain't gonna have it.  A few checking in.  That was just, yeah, a little gay porn on the boat.  I like the little mustache on the guy, the creepy guy.  How thin is that fucking mustache? 
[01:42:30]  That's terrible.  There's a guy and a girl blowing a guy, and she's fucking licking it like it's a lima  bean ice cream cone.  She wants no part of it.  Guy probably has fucking cocksucker breath right in her face with his thin mustache.  Cocksucker breath.  You know he has fucking hot popper cocksucker breath right in her face.  She's miserable.  Ah, shit.  Oh, wow.  That guy should almost be reported, though, all right?  That's, you know, it's one of those things where you look and you're just going like, 
[01:43:00]  God, what a creep this guy is.  He's run this company for like 25 years.  You just think of how much fucking ass he's gotten.  Of course he's been running for 25 years.  Yeah.  He's never leaving.  How much ass he's gotten.  Yeah.  Yeah, that happens.  It's a little gay porn.  We were looking around at other people's, but people had their other shit locked up pretty  well.  This guy, though.  His first cruise.  Wide open.  He didn't.  I don't think he knew.  And you can see other people's, like, cruise pictures, though. 
[01:43:30]  Some people left those out.  Like, oh, okay.  Got that.  We wanted to actually print it out.  Find his name.  If we wanted to, we could have found by going down to where they take your initial pictures  when you get on the cruise ship.  Mm-hmm.  And find his name and the picture of him.  And then you know who it is.  But we want to print out the picture of Todd and Jamie and slip that behind his cruise pictures.  Oh, shit.  So when he went to go collect them, he could have looked through them and said, what the  fuck is that?  Do you know what a fuck? 
[01:44:00]  Dude, he would panic for a year.  Oh, my God.  He would not know.  Thinking he was being blackmailed.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  Axel Rosenberg writes, only Anthony can get away with watching 90 minutes of gay porn and  still make fun of someone else for having it.  Hey, you guys got a point.  Yeah, why don't we do this?  We got Johnny connected.  Why don't you step into my stateroom over here?  Johnny!  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  What's up, John?  Hey, Jen.  You know, we had a guy at our company who was staying at a hotel where they were having  a conference.  And he might have had some adult material on his computer of an underage quality.  And another one at the conference was happening to be going through a shared folder looking  for music.  Oh, boy.  Saw it and decided to call the cops.  And the cops looked through the registry and looked through the computer and then knocked 
[01:45:00]  on his door where he was wide awake at three o'clock in the morning.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  Needless to say, it was awkward for him.  Did he get arrested?  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah, he had some really nasty stuff.  Oh, wow.  A real underage stuff.  But when I first got my Mac, I didn't understand all that stuff on the left-hand side.  And I did the same exact thing at a hotel.  I went through a guy's computer and I called the guy up at his hotel room.  I said, listen, you don't know me, but here's what's on your computer. 
[01:45:30]  And it's wide open.  And the guy was freaking out.  He left it.  He didn't realize it.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Watch that shit.  The guy was in a lot of trouble.  So, by the way, Anthony, you're not going to find your bags for a long time.  I am.  Why?  Who the hell happened today?  Why is that?  If it's not scanned in the system, it means they're lost someplace.  And if they're not, you know, they can't find it.  It's not there's a guy on the ramp looking for them.  They're lost in the system.  So, the guy's got to actually find them and then scan them. 
[01:46:00]  And then they've got to figure out where they are at that point.  Well, you know what?  It was taking a while.  It's because they had so many.  It wasn't just one flight that fucked up.  It was a fuckload of flights that got canceled.  So, we already found one from what I hear.  I got a text that one is found.  Ah, so they'll get the other one.  Yeah.  They'll get the other one.  Wouldn't you think the other one would be next to that one?  Not at all.  It's not going to be next to it.  Like, you're the one just telling me.  What do you think?  They take them out and go, I believe this is together. 
[01:46:30]  Let's keep this family's together.  Exactly.  Those savages throw those things around like crazy.  They're like Germans.  They just separate everything.  No, but, you know, the thing about it is, if the guy's scanning a whole block of them,  it should pop up in the same area.  It'll pop up.  Well, by the way, I saw you.  You're amazing.  Mr. Negative Nelly.  Me?  Oh, thank you.  You really are.  Jim, I've got to ask you one question.  How in the world do you deal with the hecklers as well as you do?  It's unbelievable.  Where was I when you saw a heckler? 
[01:47:00]  You were up in New England.  In Boston.  In Boston.  Oh, I am.  And the guy just kept yelling stupid stuff out.  You get used to it.  I mean, I'm doing it 21 years.  You know, it's yelling things.  What do people do?  They're idiots.  Yeah.  I had a woman.  I was at the cellar last week, and I'm working on material, and some woman's like, next.  What?  What'd you do to her?  I said, why are you saying next?  This is a comedy club, not your bedroom.  Oh, shit. 
[01:47:30]  And I got a very, very big laugh.  Wow, that is good.  And then I proceeded to go on about how her mouth was running, and I was making dick-sucking  motions.  Like, that's how she should shut up.  That's awesome.  You're terrible, Jimmy.  And I came off stage.  I was so livid.  Like, I wanted her boyfriend to say something, or I wanted her to say something else really  mean.  But she didn't.  So I had to.  I was ending my set anyway.  I was so fucking irritated.  Next.  Really?  Next?  Yeah.  Not quite your cup of tea.  But I also, part of me knew I wasn't giving that great of a performance. 
[01:48:00]  I really wasn't.  Fuck her, though.  You're right, but I really was not giving much.  Whatever.  I was very lackadaisical.  I was giving a very lackluster performance.  She should just shut up.  Oh, she learned.  There's a whole lineup of guys that are coming up, so if you don't like one, maybe you'll  like the next one.  Yeah.  She said nothing after that.  All right.  Let's say hi to Joe in North Dakota.  Joe?  Hello, Joe.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, real quick.  In Haver, Montana, there's an underground town there that's pretty fucking cool, man. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  I got to stop you, because a lot of people are talking about their underground cities  and towns and stuff.  We want a website that we could go to where someone went underwater so we could see this  shit.  And did some diving.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I was going to say, because it's old Prohibition days and stuff.  They used to smuggle all liquor, and it's right over the border from Canada. 
[01:49:00]  It's pretty cool, though.  It's a legit city, underground.  Yeah, no.  We learned that from Ant, that they do this, but now we want to see video or pictures.  He's talking about, like, underground, though.  Oh, he said underground?  Yeah.  Oh, they didn't fill it up with water?  He's missing the whole pernt.  No, I mean, you can go under there and walk around and shit.  You can't walk around.  You can go under and walk around.  How do you walk around if it was filled in?  It's not.  They have tours of it.  Oh, it's like in a big cave or something?  No, it's a town. 
[01:49:30]  Like, they had bars down there.  Yeah, but it's underground.  It's got to be a cave or something.  All right.  Check it out.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What's up?  It's underground.  So that means they filled in the town.  No, they had the normal town, you know, above-ground town.  And they built another town under it.  Because of the prohibition.  Under the ground for the...  Oh, okay.  Right.  For speakeasies.  Gotcha.  Okay. 
[01:50:00]  Holy Jesus.  That's why we didn't want to hang up on you.  Okay, we did.  All right.  All right.  No, it's pretty cool, though.  It's pretty big under there, too.  All right.  And it's completely abandoned?  No one's down there?  No, they just have tours of it.  And it's all like...  That would be pretty cool.  Yeah.  And actually, in Aver, that's where the Untouchables, one of the scenes was actually filmed there.  It's a pretty famous little prohibition.  It's pretty good.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:50:30]  I want to, like, explore some of this shit.  End of story.  I can't believe none of the New York City guys have helped me out yet.  There's some places to go.  Yeah.  This guy just made me think of something when he said Prohibition.  Yeah.  I had a dream that I was with a bunch of people.  We went to a restaurant.  Mm-hmm.  And then me and one of my friends, or my girlfriend, were brought over, and I'm like, are we going to see Sinatra?  And they're like, no, he's not here.  But they brought us to Steve Buscemi's table.  Nice.  And he had, like, a lot of people there, and he was a fan of mine. 
[01:51:00]  Of course he was.  And we welcomed, he welcomed me, and we shook hands, and then he kissed me on the lips.  Why does that have to be on the lips?  I don't know.  But he leaned over, and he had long, thin lips, and he kissed me, like, on the lips.  Oh, my God.  And I was just really, it was really awkward.  It's a whole fucking dream.  That is hysterical.  Why would he kiss you?  I don't know.  But I dreamt that Steve Buscemi kissed me on the lips after inviting me to the table.  Jesus.  Let's go to Chad in Pittsburgh.  Chad. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, Kumia.  Hey.  Hey, I've been texting back and forth with that girl.  You left the number on the Twitter account.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fucking girl.  She's blaming you.  She said you've been texting her all the time, and I'm falling in for all these lies.  That's hysterical.  Yeah, I...  I've been getting texts and voicemails.  We've played some of the voicemails on this show.  Yeah, but start from the beginning again, for the people that don't know, because that  was great radio that day.  It's some broad...  You know, over a year ago at this point, we had a fling, I'll call it. 
[01:52:00]  That's what it amounts to, a fling.  And are you regretting it at this point?  Of course I am.  Jesus Christ.  Do you wish you just jerked off that day?  Please.  Please.  And, uh...  So, you know, things...  Whatever.  Things just move on.  Move on.  Sure.  Well, things didn't move on.  I got hundreds of phone calls, voicemails that lasted the entire length of how long a voicemail  could last on your iPhone, which is like four minutes. 
[01:52:30]  One after another, after another, after another.  Text.  Texts that go just on and on and on.  Lines of them.  And, um...  And I wouldn't answer.  Just wouldn't answer.  But it just kept coming and coming with the voicemails.  So I brought up the voicemail thing on Live from the Compound, and then I brought it up here.  And we played some.  Oh, boy, did we.  And you just hear this, uh...  I just want to move on with my life, and, um... 
[01:53:00]  You know, I'm...  You don't deserve a woman like me.  I'm...  You know, I want nothing to do with you, you know, unless it's good for me.  Good for me.  I, uh...  Um...  I...  You know, your drama, your bullshit, um...  And don't sit there trying to make something of this, because that's all it is.  It's just inane babble that never ends.  And you made it perfectly clear that you're moving on.  And that there was...  Right, right, it was done. 
[01:53:30]  That there wasn't even anything to begin with.  There wasn't anything.  It was just what it was, and then move on.  Just leave.  Whatever.  So...  So the...  So ever since I played the voicemails, those stopped.  Which I was like, cool.  Alright, at least that's done.  But the texts picked up at a crazy pace.  Yeah.  So...  So...  The oddest thing happened just recently.  Like, just when I went on vacation.  I started getting texts from this girl.  But they weren't to me. 
[01:54:00]  See, they were to other people.  But I was getting them.  Have you ever heard of this happening?  So she's trying to make you jealous or something?  Because you're...  Because you're missing out?  Thank you.  That's fucking...  Thank you.  Psychotic.  So there's...  Now these texts that I'm getting are like this.  Let me see if I can find one for you.  Because they're a treat.  You're going to love some of these.  Gets you that name right. 
[01:54:30]  Let me go back.  I got to go way back.  There's a lot of names you hate at this point, huh?  A couple.  Here's what I get.  This is April 11th.  Okay.  And this isn't for me, by the way.  This is for someone.  Thanks for the thought and phone call yesterday.  It was nice to hear from you.  You sounded like you were doing good as well.  Sorry, I didn't get a chance to call you last night.  Thank you again for being a good friend. 
[01:55:00]  It's greatly appreciated.  See, these are little...  Every one of them has a little jab in there that's like,  All right, I'm the bad guy, so this shows what good guys are like.  Right.  She wants a text like that she's referring to from you.  Right, right.  Just got word from a few friends looking for checking out apartments and houses  in a few different places for me.  You should hear and see these places.  They're really nice. 
[01:55:30]  You've been in my house.  These places are nice.  Fireplace, pool, cathedral ceilings, balcony, and more.  Really?  Sounds familiar.  I might be able to bring, I don't know, someone with me, a cat maybe.  Uh, I don't think that...  Or I could just bring...  And then it goes down.  Another friend of mine, just a bunch of friends,  is hooking me up with a new phone too.  Haven't decided to change my number.  If I do, I'll have to give it to you. 
[01:56:00]  Hope to get together soon and have a few drinks.  Maybe play a game, a pool.  Oh, and I owe you a couple of dinners.  Oh, you're getting all squishy and shit on me.  Here's another one.  This is a brand new one.  Wouldn't say I'm the best, but I try.  I do what I can.  Hey, you've been nothing but cool and good to me.  I know I don't have to say.  It's a way of saying thank you, so I don't mind owing you dinner.  Wait, these were supposed to be for some other guy?  Oh, yeah, this is... 
[01:56:30]  Either...  Obviously, this person doesn't exist.  It's George Glass.  I'm texting George Glass.  This is...  Now, the fucked up thing is,  it goes from talking to a guy  to talking about a guy  in the same text.  And the texts are giant.  They're never like...  If I was getting her texts to other people,  wouldn't some just be,  all right, cool, see you there?  Well, most of them would be okay.  It's like, yeah.  Yeah, I hear that.  All right, all right, um...  LOL. 
[01:57:00]  Noon.  Exactly.  All of them are these protracted,  long things about how cool everyone is.  Most text messages are only a couple words.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me...  They really are.  And then here's the last one.  Hello, dear to you, too.  LOL.  So how's your day, my dear friend?  What's rocking?  Logan, you caught me at a perfect time.  Just got home, and things are great here. 
[01:57:30]  And then I chime in, in all caps.  Sounds great!  Stop sending me your texts!  She's...  I'll stop.  And then I go...  And then she goes...  I'll tell you a couple things off.  Right after that, it says,  Yes, that you did, LOL.  I'm sorry I had to kick you out last night,  but I had to be up damn early for work.  If I didn't, I would have let you crash on the couch. 
[01:58:00]  And then I just say,  Come on, and I put her name.  I go, Stop already.  It's funny and all, but I'm on vacation,  and getting your texts to other people is a bit odd.  Didn't know you were still getting them.  Uh, I did delete you.  Relax, wow.  No, I'm on vacation,  and I'm getting a...  Bap, bap, every five seconds  with your phony text to fake people!  I'm not relaxing.  She writes, Relax, wow. 
[01:58:30]  Relax.  I have a cheap-ass phone.  That sucks.  I don't care how cheap your phone is.  I've never gotten a text  from people that are sending people a text.  You've gotten the errant, you know,  like, oh, well, shit, that wasn't meant for you, sorry.  But, yeah, the only way...  Yeah.  Like, if you were...  If I wanted to text you,  but I quickly went through my phone  and got another Anthony that's in my phone,  then you would get a text  that I would...  meant for somebody else.  Right.  But besides that, this is impossible. 
[01:59:00]  And then...  Does it stop there?  No.  That's great, smiley face.  Pretty much same here.  Stopped by...  And then a guy's name.  After work.  Helped him with a few things around the yard  and organizing stuff.  He thought me...  Threw me a little cash for helping out.  Work's going great.  The house is empty,  and I look forward to packing up my car and moving.  It would be nice to see you before I leave.  Oh, and what was up with that kiss?  Wasn't really expecting it.  It was kind of weird, to be honest. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, well.  Got to take care of some shit  and think of working out today.  Still have to talk to another guy,  which is going to be a little hard to do.  So, LOL.  You're going to finally get your dick wet  with that married sex freak or what?  LOL.  Tomorrow's the big night.  You better get the whip's chains and swing out.  There's stud muffin.  LOL.  Oh, wait.  Don't forget the anal beads. 
[02:00:00]  LOL.  And you got this by accident?  I get all of these by accident.  As she's texting...  This isn't even stopping.  As she's texting fake people.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, she's texting fake people  but making it like,  oops, I sent this to you  instead of the fake person.  30 oopses in one day!  A little side note observation  before either of us know that, people,  you were meant...  are getting the text meant for others. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  You asked me things before that  interest...  that you're interested in me.  So, from that observation,  the three question marks  kind of told me two things.  That it was you,  not the number I recognize.  I don't know.  She just goes on and on.  This is going on  and I can't stop this.  Invited to a wedding.  Dude, I swear,  I'm scrolling through these. 
[02:01:00]  Relax.  Chill.  Life is too short.  Huh?  What am I talking about?  Text?  Oh, other people are getting the text,  she's saying.  These lights are long.  Jesus.  And no, I won't put up with shit neither.  Will I be treated like shit?  I don't deserve that.  This is for someone else.  Just saying it.  How late are you working?  Got your text from last night.  This keeps going on.  I haven't answered. 
[02:01:30]  I haven't said one thing.  This was after the first answer.  Yeah.  These are all after the first answer.  I haven't said shit.  Where she said relax.  Relax.  Relax.  And then it continued after that.  And these are still just all out.  Right.  This phone sucks.  I deleted a handful of people,  but it won't really delete them.  They're not in my contacts or anything.  That's so true.  Oh, really?  Really?  This phone is gay and stupid, damn it.  Think I might do what a guy did with his old shitty phone. 
[02:02:00]  Throw it in a lake.  Be careful with the married chick, though,  if you go through with it.  Lots of drama and bullshit attached with that,  especially where you all know each other as well.  Trust me.  It's not worth it.  Nothing good will come of it.  Just my advice.  By the way,  you know anyone that's a damn good tat artist?  Just got people here,  but want someone new and really good.  Oh, and that last day of New Cambodian New Year.  Drink up, bitch.  Celebrate for three days.  Get rash of bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. 
[02:02:30]  And then there's another one.  Blah, blah, blah.  This bring, bring, bring, bring.  That's my vacation.  Bring.  Was that bad?  Yes.  That's good,  because when you were here,  you were like,  I'm hating life with the ex-drama and shit.  And then that goes on.  I want to see where I kick in again,  because I had completely had it.  Look what I'm scrolling through. 
[02:03:00]  I am scrolling through unbelievable.  This must have been when I gave it out.  Yeah.  You want to get a female's point of view?  Let me just,  let me just get to the point  where I gave her number out over Twitter.  Sure, sure, go.  So the Tweety people could enjoy.  You just proved,  more so,  why you're not good enough for me.  More causing drama like a child.  More of your lies and bullshit. 
[02:03:30]  You also proved money doesn't make the man.  I wished you luck  and wished you the best.  I said,  then stop texting me every ten minutes,  you dolt.  Why?  You're not mature enough to ignore.  Are you doing that?  Mature enough to ignore?  Text every five fuck minutes?  It's sad.  You have no character or maturity.  Just more lies and bullshit.  This is just one reason why 
[02:04:00]  I pushed you away  and didn't believe a word you said.  Now, the only texts I've sent back  have been,  stop texting me,  shut the fuck up,  knock it off.  And hers,  they go on and on.  I said right from the start,  I knew this about you,  you've shown you weren't worth it.  It's funny and all,  but now it's boring.  Also,  these people calling me  have no life.  It's sad.  I wonder if I actually talked  with some of these people. 
[02:04:30]  And then I put,  shut up.  Enough of your fake texts  to other people.  I got 30 texts from you  while I'm on vacation.  You annoying fuck.  Leave me alone.  You're really cracking me up  with this.  And this is coming from  someone that doesn't like drama.  Someone asked for your number.  I'm not a douchebag,  so therefore I didn't give it out.  I said,  just stop texting me.  It's that easy.  It's that easy.  Knock it off.  I had some nice convos  with some of those people. 
[02:05:00]  Thanks.  I made a few new friends.  And I didn't trash you  or need to.  Have a good night.  You proved my point.  Money doesn't make the man.  Have a good night.  Right.  Okay.  Now stop texting me.  That's all I wrote.  Right.  Okay.  Now stop.  I see you making up  more lies and bullshit.  Really?  For someone who doesn't like drama,  you do a lot to start it.  People told me  you put my number on Twitter.  I've moved  and still moving forward  in my life.  I will ignore you  and your bullshit.  Have a nice life. 
[02:05:30]  No response.  Nice.  It's done.  It's done, right?  Done.  Finally.  See when that was.  Finally over.  That was a long year.  Wow.  Finally over.  That was April 17th  at 4.02 a.m.  So that was, uh, okay.  We're up to April 18th.  No, here's April 17th  at 6.20 a.m.  But she said,  Wow, you really are  not good enough for me.  But she said,  have a nice life  at 4.20.  Well, in a couple of hours.  And yes,  my phone has truly  been fucked up. 
[02:06:00]  They're not fake.  I wish the two of you  luck.  And I,  this phone issue  will be resolved.  Uh,  and just ignore the texts  knowing it will be  resolved soon.  No, I'm not gonna ignore  bring, bring, bring, bring.  You're way too high strung.  Everyone wants your number,  by the way.  All of your so-called fans  and pests want it  and, uh,  are trying to get it from me  to have it posted.  Um, I'm not.  I wouldn't do it.  I don't care. 
[02:06:30]  Really,  you haven't come up  with something new yet?  The same,  other than dolt?  Hey,  if the dolt,  if the dolt,  if the dolt fits,  dolt it.  Yeah.  All right,  how about cankles?  You like,  you like that name?  Cankles?  They're a little thick.  A little thick.  What were you thinking?  Someone that thin,  it should,  they shouldn't be that thick.  What were you thinking?  Just bored that weekend?  Very bored,  confused.  Drug-induced,  I have no idea. 
[02:07:00]  And now people want me  to talk to Ron and Fez.  They want to know  my side of the story.  People are texting me  saying,  sorry that he did that to you  and he's trashing you.  Uh,  and they're asking  for your number.  So this is the drama  you started with  not just going,  okay,  she wished me luck  doing shit with her life.  Her phone is fucked up.  It'll be resolved soon  and I'll just ignore the text.  This is her telling me  what I should have done 
[02:07:30]  when I'm getting  fucking every five minutes.  Her text to  these fucking  George Glass.  that's rational,  normal behavior.  Your behavior isn't  normal and rational.  You haven't changed  or grown up at all.  I hope at some point  you do though.  I don't need the bullshit  to put up with you though,  Anthony.  And I was very cool with you.  You knew I had a lot of shit  going on in my life  at the time  and really didn't need  that shit.  You damn well know  I'm a good woman. 
[02:08:00]  I haven't done anything  on purpose.  The way you're being,  posting the numbers  and trashing me  is something  I would have done  at age 15  slash 22.  15 to 22.  23 never.  Can you please  just text her right now  and say I want you?  No!  Why?  No way!  For the show.  I'm actually doing shit  in my life  and don't pay attention to you.  Because I'm actually  doing shit in my life  and don't pay attention to you. 
[02:08:30]  I get texts.  I swear to people.  I swear to you.  It's literally  every five minutes.  Really got to talk  to some cool people.  They all want your number.  And these things are wrong.  I'm not repeating  one text.  These are all of them  that just keep  pouring the fuck in.  I've talked to people.  They're trashing you.  And then some, Anthony,  because of that.  I don't have to say anything.  Nor do I care to.  It's all gay and drama  and BS.  It's sad.  And you do shit like that? 
[02:09:00]  You turn your own fans  and pests against yourself.  And then one more text  from me.  Stop texting me.  It's my contribution.  Just letting you know.  That's all.  Have a good night.  All right.  That's it then.  I don't.  It's just sad.  That's all.  Thank you.  It's appreciated.  Hope you have a great day.  And that'll, um...  That's it?  Yeah.  That's it for now.  How long ago was the last one? 
[02:09:30]  For now.  I just...  Look at this.  Someone sent it.  Oh, let me see.  Dr. Steve.  Sounds like my ex.  Ugh.  I feel your pain.  And, uh...  Yeah.  Someone sent me a picture  of this girl.  Hug.  Yeah.  What are you gonna do?  Ah.  So, it'll stop now.  You think it will? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, the last one made it obvious that it's over, finally.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Michelle in Boston.  Michelle?  Anthony, those George Glass texts, those aren't for you.  Those are for your girlfriend to see.  Really?  That's what she's trying to do.  She's trying to get your girlfriend to see them and make her think they're real.  Oh, you think?  Yeah?  Wow, you bitches got all the tricks.  Yes, we do.  Yeah, one of you bitches.  That's pretty smart, if you think about it.  You and your bitches.  That's a smart one. 
[02:10:30]  We bitches know what we're doing.  No, because the thing is, she knows that everyone knows the story here.  Oh, yeah, I know that.  Like, everyone knows the story, so it's not fooling anybody.  It's just crazy.  One gets through, and one makes her think.  That's all.  She's trying to get that one to make your girlfriend think that maybe, just maybe, it's true.  Yeah, please.  Well, that's not going to happen.  All right, punch it out, boys.  All right.  No, it's just, this girl just will not stop, no matter what. 
[02:11:00]  Just won't fucking stop texting.  I don't know.  What do you do?  Hold on, hold on.  What do you do?  You just fucking, I don't know.  All right, let me see.  Why, uh, what?  Yeah, I don't know if you want me to say it.  Why?  Yeah, why, yeah.  Why text her back at all?  At all, yeah, yeah.  Because it just gets like, just stop.  Like, just stop.  Because if I, whether I, let me say, whether I did or didn't, because I've done both. 
[02:11:30]  I've done both strategies.  I've gone months without one text back.  And it doesn't stop.  If I text one back, then it just, there's no way to stop it.  If it was legal, would you take a cinder block to our head?  I don't advocate violence against people.  Well, that's why I, I, that's how I do it.  I don't advocate any violence against people.  I said if it was legal, that's, that's the key here.  No, there's some moral issues. 
[02:12:00]  Would you, would you, I, I would, okay, here.  I would, I would.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No problem.  That, that, yeah, that, that.  And then, and then, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Make it, make it number 11.  By the way, I, by the way, I didn't even read every single one of those texts.  Wow.  It just, it just, it goes on and on and on. 
[02:12:30]  And I have, I've downloaded onto my computer and cleared my phone and then gotten more and  more.  So.  And the voicemails.  Can we get Lydia on the phone?  The voicemails that go on and on and on.  What, Lydia?  Why?  What do you think Lydia is?  Well, because this is exactly what you got.  Ah, ha, ha.  Could be.  It's the exact same fucking thing.  Could be.  I know we're speaking in code. 
[02:13:00]  Let me see.  Hold on.  Those type of people will never stop.  Never fucking stop.  What the hell happened?  Let's go to Marty in Florida.  Marty.  Ant's trying to figure something out over there, so I'll take a couple calls.  What's up, Marty?  I text that girl for you, and man, these last two mornings, she sent me a text with a smiley face that says, have a good day.  So I called Sprint this morning after I caught it and blocked her damn number. 
[02:13:30]  She hasn't said anything else, and I haven't replied.  But every morning, both mornings, yesterday and this morning, she sent me a text that says, have a good day with a smiley face at the end.  So now she's stalking the people that are texting her.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Good luck, people.  Wow.  Good luck to you.  God.  It's like that movie where you play that video for somebody.  The Ring.  Yeah.  Oh, it's The Ring.  Yeah.  It's like The Ring.  Dominic in Pennsylvania. 
[02:14:00]  Dominic.  Hey, guys.  First time caller.  Anthony.  Yeah.  I got a text from a friend of mine last week.  Same thing.  And I got two texts three days later from people I didn't know.  And I'm wondering about AT&T.  I got AT&T.  I was wondering if they're putting like a reply to all.  So if you send a reply back, it goes to everybody you sent the text to.  No one's fucking good at that.  Guys, I love the show, by the way.  Jimmy, I love you.  Happy birthday.  I don't think so.  I'll leave you with that. 
[02:14:30]  All right, man.  How does one accidentally text the wrong person someone else's text repeatedly?  Repeatedly.  That's coming in a lot.  Repeatedly.  Repeatedly.  I don't know how it's done.  Someone wants to know if your rabbit's been killed yet.  All right.  Let me say hi to David in Texas.  A lot of people can relate to this.  David.  Yeah.  David.  I'm going to tell Anthony.  I went through the same thing with this bitch.  And I had to call the police.  And I had written evidence of her calling and bugging me. 
[02:15:00]  And they got it stopped.  It's called harassed by communication.  Yeah.  And I know.  I've contacted authorities, gone to certain levels with it, but it's just kind of, ah.  Good luck.  I don't know.  All right.  Let's say hi to Joe in Oceanside.  Joe.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Um, yeah, I had an ex-girlfriend, she did the same thing, except her text would be like,  oh, what time will you be here?  I can't wait to see you. 
[02:15:30]  Last night was amazing.  And it's just fucking, she just wants you to give that first answer of showing that you  care.  And then it'll be like, oh, how's everything?  Oh.  Please do that for the show.  No, I would never.  There's no fucking way I would send her a civil text.  The only text she's ever getting from me is stop texting me.  Please text her.  I made a big mistake.  I need you in my life.  No fucking way.  You love her. 
[02:16:00]  No fucking way would I ever do this.  Give me your phone.  No way.  No.  Are you prepping your phone?  No.  Please.  You assholes.  Please.  It was a big mistake.  I see it your way now.  My God, man.  We've all had one, huh?  Touch it out.  Yeah.  You know, that's how it works.  What are you going to do?  All right.  What are you going to do?  Any more advice or are you good? 
[02:16:30]  A lot of people are relating, though, that's for sure.  Are there?  Oh, yeah, man.  A lot of people are saying you can block the number on the Android.  Android.  Well, I have an iPhone, so I'll just wait, apparently.  Things will, as long as.  I think she said for the 20th time she's done.  Yeah, as long as I'm patient.  As long as I'm patient.  She'll let.  Crazy.  The beauty of those people, they'll let you know when they're done.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks for that.  Thanks.  Thanks.  So, I wait. 
[02:17:00]  And get more.  Let me say hi to Andrew.  Bring.  Andrew?  Yeah.  Andrew?  Hey.  How you doing, man?  All right.  How's it going?  What's up, Andrew?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I'd like to thank Open Anthony to help me keep the most married guys married.  Oh, really?  Wow.  There's this type of thing out there, Ant.  Hmm.  Well, this is what you want to do.  This is what keeps us from not going out walking.  But Ant's not married. 
[02:17:30]  Ant was actually.  Yeah, it's just one of those.  Ant was actually single doing his thing.  It just goes to show you.  And then it was one of those girls that, you know.  Everyone just, you know.  Things happen, but he realized, okay, that was just what it was, and that's it.  Yeah.  But she decided, no, no, no, no.  Everyone is.  Every guy is guilty of it.  And I don't want to fucking hear one guy say, you know, they haven't pulled one of these  shenanigans, you know.  Come on. 
[02:18:00]  Right?  Right?  Am I right or am I wrong?  I think you're right.  Guys, you know, we make our mistakes.  All right, we should break.  Yeah, yeah, that's great.  All right.  Fantastic.  I eagerly await the next text.  I'm sure there'll be 20 of them.  Sirius XM, the virus.  Yeah, this is the O.P.D. Anthony Show.  Damn it. 
[02:18:30]  Ant's first day back from vacation.  Yes.  You were gone two weeks.  I think I took four days.  Four days?  I think so.  Three, four.  How was it?  Four days, maybe.  How was it?  What'd you do?  Well, I wanted to go away, but I got the kids.  So I figured, you know, make it kind of one of those working vacations.  I felt like I was on vacation for two weeks. 
[02:19:00]  Did you have fun?  Did I have fun?  Yeah.  No.  Oh.  I didn't do anything.  I tried to hit golf balls one day.  I went to an Easter egg fucking hunt over the weekend.  Hey, you got, you got, you got like women that, yeah, well, how do I explain this?  You go to family functions and stuff where women have had kids recently, right? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  There's a thing that happens where every woman wants to brag about the fact they had the worst  pregnancy ever and they have to tell you how big their baby was and there was a natural  childbirth and they try to outdo each other.  They sit around a table and they try to outdo each other.  That's like a thing now?  Yeah, it's a thing.  Please, if someone out there knows what I'm talking about.  Is it new?  That's what I've been going on for years. 
[02:20:00]  I think it's been going on forever that women want to sit around and brag that their pregnancy  was the worst and that their vagina was destroyed the worst.  Because I'm sitting around going, you're basically saying that your pussy was destroyed way more  than that woman's pussy over there because her baby wasn't as big as your baby when it  went for the natural child.  There's no reason for that.  It's like when guys complain about their jobs, they try to outdo it.  You're like, oh, my job is hell on earth.  That's what that's like with women.  Right.  But I had no idea this went on, you know. 
[02:20:30]  Wow.  And my wife chose not to participate because she's sitting on the way home.  That means that, I can't name names, that means she's basically saying that her vagina  was completely just destroyed by her baby.  Destroyed, yeah, yeah.  And that her vagina is not as bad over there.  Yeah.  It was a discussion that was going around.  They're all talking about how their fucking pussy was kicked by Dudley Moore's bad club  boot.  Phones fucking lit.  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  This is a phenomenon that's happening.  I never know.  Every woman wants the world to know they had the worst pregnancy.  As far as vaginal fuck up.  Yeah, but they don't talk about that means that their vagina was completely destroyed.  But we know.  But that's what it means.  Yeah, we know what it means.  Oh, thank you.  Can I take a couple of these?  Please humor me with this.  Only if there are women with big pussies.  Well, we're only going to get the guy pointed to you.  Your girlfriend?  Yes.  No.  If there are fucking me, why would it be?  No, I meant a woman with a big pussy.  Oh.  That's you. 
[02:21:30]  I thought you meant a cat or something.  That was meowing all over the damn yard.  Never insult your girlfriend.  I'd insult you.  That's fine.  Either way, it's acceptable.  Here we go.  Kevin in Houston.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Explain this to Anthony for me, please.  My wife's best friend does this shit all the time.  It's always about her, how she had three kids, and nobody else in the world has ever  had kids except for this bitch.  I mean, and it always happens.  My wife, our youngest daughter weighed 10 pounds when she was born, but that doesn't 
[02:22:00]  matter because she had three kids.  Yeah, but this is what they said.  They went around the room.  Well, my baby was nine pounds, eight ounces, and had a huge head.  Well, my baby, over and over again, they had to break my pelvis to get my baby out because  I decided to go natural.  Oh, God, no.  Around the table.  And then if one had a more impressive pregnancy, then the other girl had to, you know, up the  ante. 
[02:22:30]  They should brag like that about the way their husbands fuck them.  Yeah.  Like, you know, I can't believe my pussy's so big, he really pounds it and beats it up.  That'd be a hot discussion.  That's baby head.  Head's coming out.  He broke my pelvis when I talked during the game.  He fucking hit me with a fucking pool cue.  Down the stairs.  Yeah.  Dummy.  Please don't talk about the game.  What game?  If you're going to talk about the game, you're talking about the Knicks, right?  No.  Was it just an imaginary game in your scenario?  It really was, but I know that the Knickerbockers blew it.  They sure did. 
[02:23:00]  They sure did blow it.  Well, you know, it's only a game.  They were up 10 points for most of the second half.  They ended up losing.  And Carmelo tried to win it at the buzzer.  Oh, yeah?  Failed.  How did the Lakers do it?  Are they down 1-0?  Lakers are down, I think, 1-0, right?  They've only played one so far?  Yeah.  I might not.  What do you think of Kobe saying fag?  He didn't even say fag it.  He said fucking fag to the ref.  How is it used?  It's dumb to do.  He was pissed.  If you play sports, you say shit.  Yeah.  So, you know, he gets called for a foul or a technical. 
[02:23:30]  I don't know exactly what.  I only saw the clip where it picks up.  He's on the bench now, and he's really fucking pissed off.  And he goes, fucking fag.  Whoa.  And so he was fined $100,000 by the NBA.  Ridiculous.  And then he apologizes to Glad, and they're glad for the apology, and they're also glad  for the fine, too, I guess.  Why would you apologize?  Honestly, I understand why people apologize.  Obviously, he doesn't mean it. 
[02:24:00]  Why would he mean it?  He shouldn't have to mean it.  What I said was ignorant.  He doesn't believe that.  Anti-gay slur.  Would you stop it?  And again, would I say sorry if I was him?  Yeah, because there's so much endorsement money.  Of course.  It's not worth it to be proud and go, I'm not sorry.  You know.  What I learned, the gays don't like the word fag, and faggots don't like the word fag  now, either.  Like people that are just being kind of faggy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry, but there's different meanings to that word.  Of course.  And when you grew up, you called people fags and faggots, and you had no idea about sexuality 
[02:24:30]  at that point in your life, especially.  I don't want to hear shit.  It's just something that goes on.  I don't want to hear shit from Glad, because they kept quiet, as far as I know, about queer  out with the straight guy.  Like, and again, until these groups are not fucking selective, and they go after, then  I'll listen to them.  But while they're still being selective and saying, we can say it, and you can't.  Gay guys throw around the word fag all the time.  Of course they do.  They call each other fag.  Gay guys are hilarious.  Fag hag.  This is my fag hag, and you know, whatever. 
[02:25:00]  But we're in a society where they're allowed to say it because, you know, they're gay.  Well, I'm tired of that whole thing, too.  I was walking down the street.  It started with the blacks, with that N-word thing.  Well, I was walking down the street recently, and some Utes were behind me.  Yeah.  I wish I was brave enough, and I'll be the first to admit that I couldn't pull out my  flip, and I wanted to pull it out so you could hear them throwing the word around like it's  nothing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So why is it bad when someone else uses the word?  They were saying fag or nigger? 
[02:25:30]  They were using the N-word, back and forth.  Black guys?  Yes.  Oh.  But what's the...  Obviously, the word's not that powerful if you use it like that.  Come on.  Come on.  Language.  This language thing is driving me nuts.  So Kobe should be able to say that, especially in the heat of battle.  It's dumb to do on TV.  But I don't even think the ref is even known for being, you know, gay.  The fine for it shouldn't be so astronomically higher than other fines for stuff like that. 
[02:26:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, those guys know if you say something like that, you're going to get fucking fine.  They know it going in.  But you shouldn't have a fine that is four times...  But when you're playing sports, you're not thinking, you know, when you get pissed off,  all of a sudden you just say shit.  You do.  You know?  The refs are such sacred cows, though.  It's like you can't criticize them to the...  It's like, why not?  Why shouldn't you be able to attack them?  They're a part of the game.  Why can't you badmouth them to the media if they fucking stink? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  They're costing you...  You work your whole season, and a bad call is going to cost you a game?  It's like, they should be a bash verbally.  Yeah.  But you can't call them fag.  Yeah, that was dumb on his part.  Let me say hi to Chad in Baltimore.  Chad.  I'm sorry, the two what?  You're not getting at the two Utes?  Don't think that's funny this morning?  Anyway, we married a bunch of guys from the neighborhood. 
[02:27:00]  I mean, we all knew each other before we married the girls that we're married to,  which they're all sisters.  So the one sister ends up standing up saying,  don't even talk to me unless you had eight or more stitches.  So then, we all knew each other back from the neighborhood,  so we go outside and we start busting my brother-in-law's balls, man,  about the daddy stitch thing, you know, about how loose that must be,  is your dick big enough for even that, and all that kind of stuff. 
[02:27:30]  Just, you know, the daddy stitch plays a big part in that.  So what?  One woman said, don't even talk to me unless you've had eight stitches,  meaning her pregnancy was the worst.  I didn't know this happened, Dan.  Eight stitches.  They count them like fucking stripes on your arm.  Yeah.  And eight stitches.  Let me go to Bobby in Maine.  Bobby!  Hey, what's going on, boy?  Hey, Bobby.  Hey, my wife, my kid's about two now.  My wife still pulls this shit.  She always talks about, we got a couple friends that had kids,  and she goes, well, mine was 10-3, and I did it all natural.  Yeah, it's a weird bragging thing that they do. 
[02:28:00]  I had no idea until this weekend that this went on.  I thought I was the only one.  Yeah.  They brag about doing it all natural, too?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I went all natural, and mine was 10, and, you know,  his head was twice the normal size of a baby,  and they just add shit onto it.  Do we take photos of our shits and show each other as guys?  Like, you ever push out a fucking giant tube?  You'll tell your friends, like, dude, I fucking dropped a log,  and it poked out of the water.  We brag about our shit size, and we wonder why they brag about babies. 
[02:28:30]  How depressing is it when you really have an impressive one,  and there's no one around to tell?  I fucking pull it out and put it on my sink.  You get so sad when you have to flush with no one knowing.  But now that we got cell phones, at least we get to take pictures of them.  Yes, of course.  And set them around.  Proud moments.  But before cell phones, it was very sad to flush without anyone knowing  what you just accomplished.  You get your Polaroid out, and it just sounds weird in the bathroom.  Polaroid's making a comeback. 
[02:29:00]  They're not, though.  They're like records.  They're going to make a comeback in a small segment of the population,  and people are like, oh, yeah, these sucked.  Go to Urban Outfitters, man.  Exactly.  They have them.  More people are just too convenient.  Bunch of twinks and fucking diesel shirts.  Too convenient to just have your little digital phone.  Ethan from Cali.  It says it right there on the screen.  Cali.  Hey.  Going back to Cali.  I don't think so.  Ethan, what do you got? 
[02:29:30]  Actually, the night that my wife was going into labor, we were at a party,  and there were all these old ladies there.  And some of them were like, oh, I was in labor for 22 hours.  And one lady was like, I took eight seconds to get my baby.  It just popped right out.  My wife was like freaking out.  And they're all talking about subjects like, it took me two days.  And the subjects were like, oh, it took me eight seconds.  Yeah.  It's old ladies.  I'll be honest.  I don't know if this subject's going anywhere. 
[02:30:00]  The phones are lit, but no one's really explaining it properly.  But just something I learned.  Women sit around and fucking have to up each other's pregnancy story.  I have no idea.  No.  I don't know anything about pregnant women.  I really don't.  Well, you've had a few in your family.  Yeah, but I don't know anything about them.  I don't know.  Like I just saw them and they were fat.  Other women don't freak me out, but the idea of me being responsible for it just scares me.  Yeah.  It scares me.  Um, anyone see the little fuckers?  Uh, I did not. 
[02:30:30]  You saw the little fuckers?  No, I didn't see it.  I didn't see it, but it's fuckers is how it's pronounced.  Little fuckers.  They're trying so hard to make it more like fuckers though.  They keep saying, you know, little fuckers.  And then they try to do this thing in the movie where it's the grand fucker.  Fucker.  Yeah.  So they're trying to do some godfather thing or the god fucker.  What do they say?  Fucker.  The god fucker.  The god fucker they say.  God fucker.  And that storyline went nowhere in the movie.  I finally saw it.  And I'm so...  Why?  I get annoyed at the trailer for it. 
[02:31:00]  And I sent out two tweets because I just needed to do something.  Yeah.  I was so angry.  You wanted to hurt it somehow?  Yes.  And my tweets sucked about it because I just didn't know...  It is the biggest pile of shit I've ever seen.  What was your tweet?  And they completely...  Nothing really.  I basically said that it was obvious...  I didn't have enough characters.  Oh, that they were shot?  Barbra Streisand...  Someone tell me what happened with this movie.  Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman were signed for the second movie for them.  But it was so obvious that they weren't on set with anybody. 
[02:31:30]  Barbra Streisand, it looked like, was on set for one day.  So she was interacting with some of the characters.  Dustin Hoffman, the only person they showed him with was Ben Stiller.  I was telling Aunt during the break, there was this big kid party in a backyard.  And Ben Stiller and Dustin Hoffman, of course, Dustin Hoffman is his father,  are walking up to the gate of the party.  And Dustin awkwardly says, well, I got to go do this one thing.  I'll meet you, you know, in the back.  Because he wasn't...  And then wait, did he meet him in the back? 
[02:32:00]  No!  He doesn't...  That was the only time he was with anyone in the movie.  Until the last scene where they...  Where obviously the producer said, look, we need at least one shot with everybody.  So they talked to everyone to do this, you know, we're in a living room, it's Christmas time type of scene.  And that's how the movie ends, six months later.  But that was the only scene where they all were together.  I bet there was some awkwardness, though.  Because when De Niro and Ben Stiller look at each other like, huh?  I'm watching you.  Well, guess what?  I'm brave enough to now say I'm watching you back. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, shit.  Why doesn't that relationship change already?  But then...  And the movie starts with Barbra Streisand on the phone with Dustin Hoffman, because he's in Spain learning how to dance.  And it's like...  With that old gag.  That old gag they did.  And you know Barbra Streisand didn't even do that with him, that she did her part separately, he did his separately, and then they made it look like they were talking.  Of course.  And then at one point, Owen Wilson is inside with Barbra Streisand.  So yeah, Barbra was with Owen in one scene.  Then he walks outside, and his hair is like twice as long. 
[02:33:00]  No way.  So obviously this scene was filmed probably for the other movie, and they decided, fuck, we need something.  Dig around the tape and see if you can find something.  Really?  Really.  You've got to see this movie just to see how horrendous this is.  I bet there was a lot of reshoots, too.  That might have been part of the problem.  Hoffman wasn't signed until after the film was completed?  Are you kidding?  So they had to go back and reshoot?  I believe it.  Like all his scenes are reshots.  I believe it.  Wow.  Reshoots, they're called, Sam, in the business.  I've never done a movie. 
[02:33:30]  Reshots.  So they have the movie.  It's done.  I believe it.  They get Dustin Hoffman.  It's like, okay, he's signed.  So now let's film some segments that we can shoehorn in in between.  I completely believe it.  That makes for a great movie.  And I'm sorry we're bringing it up months after the fact, but I finally saw it, and I couldn't believe it.  Because it is a huge franchise, obviously.  And they just ruined it.  I wonder why he wouldn't do it.  But the producers should have said, you know what, why don't we just wait then and do this properly? 
[02:34:00]  Because it's so obvious.  It's just patched together.  So obvious.  Was it funny, his parts?  There wasn't one laugh in the entire movie.  See, now I'm going to have to watch it just to see the awkwardness of them not being in the same place.  What were the names of the movie?  Meet the Fockers?  Meet the Parents.  Oh, Meet the Parents?  Yeah.  And what was the second one again?  I forgot.  Meet the Fockers?  Yeah, Meet the Fockers.  Or Fuckers?  No, it was Fockers because they were meeting their, Ben Stiller's parents.  I liked Meet the Parents a lot.  It's the only one I saw.  And I really did like it.  Yes.  There were no gags in this movie at all that were funny. 
[02:34:30]  First of all, it was funny.  Were they trying to do the same gags over and over again?  And I don't know.  I really don't know.  Did Robert De Niro ask if anybody was a pothead?  I don't know.  Was he looking suspiciously?  That was funny in the first one.  That was funny in the first one.  That was funny in the first one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then at one point, they digitized their faces.  Look for that, too.  When they're talking to that broad from Jurassic Park that's now an old bitch. 
[02:35:00]  Ouch.  Dern.  Dern.  Dern.  Thank you.  Dern.  Dern.  So she's like, I don't know, the headmaster or whatever of this school that they're trying  to get their little kids into.  And there's a scene where they're all outside.  And it's creepy how they digitized De Niro and partly Stiller's face.  For what?  I guess looking a little too old for their roles or something.  What?  You got to see his movie, Ann.  Immediately.  Now I have to see it.  Because you'll see Dustin Hoffman learning how to flamingo or whatever.  Who the fuck wants to see that? 
[02:35:30]  Why would he do that?  He's in Spain.  That's the excuse why he's not around.  Oh.  And they had to make that excuse early in the movie.  Oh, yeah.  Like when Suzanne Somers was on vacation.  Oh, yeah.  Before.  Yeah.  When she was in contract negotiations.  Yeah.  And she wasn't on the show.  They would have it like, oh, we got a call from Chrissy.  Hi, Chrissy.  How are you?  Because they wouldn't let her on set with the other cast members.  And wait till you see Owen Wilson with short hair and then long within seconds.  Wow.  This is horrible.  Because he's inside. 
[02:36:00]  He's going to talk to Barbra Streisand when they're at the kids party.  And then he has to go back out to join everybody else.  Wow.  And he has long, curly hair.  And he almost has a Dutch boy hairdo when he's talking to Barbra Streisand.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Dude, this is the biggest pile of shit.  And I'm so mad we didn't watch it immediately.  You just sold it.  You have to see it.  You just sold it.  Because there was no way I was watching it.  But now I want to get the full douche chill value from it.  And then they finally realize, okay, now that Hoffman is signed, now this makes sense. 
[02:36:30]  The last scene where they're all in a living room, Christmas time.  So now you almost believe that they made this movie together because now you see them all  together at the last scene, which was maybe two minutes long.  So they were able to get, like, Barbra Streisand back again?  They probably got them all.  I'm going to guess they got them all for one day back to the reshoot of Hoffman or a week.  Barbra Streisand.  What the fucking greedy pigs, man.  That's fantastic.  If I had to guess, Barbra Streisand was on set for two days.  And what does a movie take nowadays?  A lot shorter, but maybe two months, three months probably? 
[02:37:00]  Hoffman did five days.  For $7.5 million.  For $7 million.  How did he do five days?  That's impossible.  What do you mean?  Rehearsals.  Five days.  I'm trying to think.  Oh, my God.  They probably shot stuff they didn't use, too.  He's got a dance.  I think he was in four.  He's got a flamenco dance.  He was in probably four scenes.  He's got to fake a phone call.  He was almost at the kid's party.  He was at the gate of the kid's party.  He was at the gate of the kid's party.  And it was so awkward.  I've got to do this.  I'll meet you inside.  I was like, oh, my God.  He wasn't there that day. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, I get it.  You're leaving.  You're not there.  You're not there, so we can't have you walk in the backyard.  Oh, fuck.  Because you weren't there that day.  And there was no legitimate excuse for him to not walk into the back with him?  Except that the scene was filmed literally months ago.  Except he wasn't in it.  It was something like, I got to talk to that guy.  It was so late.  I got to.  I'm not in this.  He might as well have just gone.  Dude, I'm not in this.  Travis, you see this?  Now I have to.  No, but I have to.  Now you have to. 
[02:38:00]  You just fucking sold this movie to so many people.  Look on YouTube, Sam.  See if there's any stuff from fuckers.  Jessica Alba is fucking really hot in it.  Yeah.  Captain Obvious.  Yeah.  And Harvey Keitel's in it.  They should have just made the movie around Harvey Keitel.  He would have hung around.  Who does he play?  Does he show his penis?  A guy that's digging a hole for a pool or something.  I tried.  I was mad.  Strawberry.  Delivery.  I wish I could do Jay's impression here. 
[02:38:30]  All you hear is Jay Moore when you see him.  And he was doing that exact delivery in this movie.  Three games.  That's the game.  Seven, gentlemen.  Let me say hi to Jamie in Missouri.  Jamie?  It's Jamie.  All right.  What's up, brother?  You saw this pile of shit?  No, no.  Most of the movie was a pile of shit.  They were repeating the same stuff.  There was two good parts to the movie I really enjoyed, though.  De Niro and Ben Stiller boxing each other.  That was the shit.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:39:00]  That sounds funny.  I'm getting reminded of a couple other things.  De Niro and Ben Stiller have a huge over-the-top fight scene.  Yeah, I think that's what I was saying.  Yeah.  At the beginning of the movie, Robert De Niro is interrogating Ben like he used to do in the other movies.  Of course.  He took some boner medication.  He's sitting there with a raging huge boner.  And Ben has to see what it is.  That scene was so uncomfortable because you're looking at De Niro like you agree to this.  He's standing there with a massive fucking boner.  I saw that in a trailer.  And then Ben Stiller had to fucking hit it with a needle to make the boner go down. 
[02:39:30]  And the kid walks in right when he does it.  It wasn't funny.  And De Niro does one of those screams that just is like douchey.  Well, De Niro also had a producer credit on this movie, so he had a lot of money.  Ah, a lot of money at stake.  What do Rotten Tomatoes end up giving it in the end?  I believe nine.  Nine percent.  Nine percent?  That's all critics.  What about people, though?  I'll go back.  People are going to be like, oh.  It was great.  Let me say hi to Kyle.  44.  44 percent of the people.  That's embarrassing. 
[02:40:00]  Arthur is another pile of gold.  That came out?  I thought it was still.  I thought it was still.  You know, you were on vacation for two weeks.  It came out, I think, the Friday you left.  And it's already on Netflix, man.  Wow.  No, I don't know if it is, but it might as well be.  Arthur's only 25 percent.  It's made 6.9 million.  Arthur made 6.9 million.  It made more than that.  It made 6.9 million this weekend.  Last weekend was 12, I think.  So probably around 20.  That's still 11. 
[02:40:30]  Kyle, what do you got?  Hey, the show, guys.  I'm just going to say there's a website called moviemistakes.com.  Get Sam to pull it up.  And I've got a whole bunch of shit on.  It's surprising what gets you by until you go back and watch a movie while you pull this  up on a laptop.  It's so obvious the shit that's in some of these movies that they just don't pick up on.  Well, they used to call them film flubs, and there were a bunch of books out before  the internet.  And me and my brother would watch bad comedies just to do a film flub game. 
[02:41:00]  We would love it.  And we would even stop the movie.  Okay, what's going to be wrong in this scene?  And if you could call a film flub before it happened, you got more points.  It was awesome.  We would sit around just bored and do this.  But that was, you could only do that after they invented like VCRs even.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like before that, shit just blew right by you.  You never noticed.  And filmmakers would just be like, what, are people going to freeze frame it?  They're going to stop it?  Stop.  It was a good drinking game. 
[02:41:30]  If you missed one, you lost points or whatever.  But, I mean, any scene at a restaurant or something, you'd stop it and go, okay, his beer,  the level of the beer is going to go up and down, up and down, up and down.  Yeah, the level of the drink, the amount of food in the plate, the cigarette length.  If you look closely, you'll see crazy shit where all of a sudden they have a full plate  of food and the next scene they don't have any food and then the next scene, the next  cut, the food is back.  Yep.  I just, I can't remember what movie I just found.  I just, I never catch film flubs. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Like literally never catch them.  No matter how obvious they are, I never.  Where's he going with this?  I'm nowhere.  Honestly, that's my destination.  Dude, I literally, the one that I caught, I was surprised I caught it.  I just don't, if you replace the character with people of another race, I might notice.  I never catch that shit.  What was the courtroom movie with Glenn Close?  Because this is a famous one. 
[02:42:30]  Her suit in the same scene changes colors.  Really?  Yeah.  And they decided, well, no one's going to notice.  Oh, I know which one you mean, the movie with Glenn Close.  Oh, what?  Gaveling.  Gaveling.  That's cool.  The courtroom movie, Gaveling?  Yeah, because it's for the judges.  Yes, with the gavel, of course.  Yes.  So now you've got to see the movie, Ed. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And just keep in mind, obviously Dustin Hoffman wasn't there.  And it makes the movie great.  Now I can't wait.  I'm an expert at film flubs.  I catch them all.  Yeah?  I certainly do.  Who are you?  Ted, the film flub catcher.  Oh.  I remember I was watching The Poseidon Adventure.  Oh.  And I said, in the one scene I said, it's actually eight degrees colder than it was when they first started talking.  I know because I read that. 
[02:43:30]  I go with temperature.  How did you tell temperature?  You have to be very good.  It's a horrible film flub.  Do you think so?  It's awful.  No.  He doesn't catch any props being listening.  I wouldn't be like, oh, that's amazing.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  No.  Temperature.  Ed catches the temperature differences.  It's Jagged Edge.  Oh, is it?  Glenn Close.  And Arthur did, 64% of the people that go to the movie liked it. 
[02:44:00]  25% of the critics liked it.  For a comedy, 64% is not bad as far as approval.  Marty, New York, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, you guys seen the one in the Hurt Locker?  No.  A movie like that, it's tough to fuck up.  It's actually on YouTube also.  There's a really intense scene where he's going through a warehouse right before they find the guy on the table.  That's like all cut up, and he's going through this curtain.  Right when he goes through the curtain, you just see a PA's arm like hold the curtain back like in full view. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, wow.  And he made the final cut of the movie.  Yeah, he made the final cut, and he's like supposed to be alone in the warehouse.  It's hysterical.  Those are my favorite ones out of all, where some of the crew is seen, or a piece of equipment, something like that.  They used to, Mike Booms were constantly in movies.  It's amazing how they fucked that up consistently years ago.  Yeah.  Who's Mike Booms?  Let me say hi to Andy in Cleveland.  Hey, it's Mike Booms. 
[02:45:00]  Hey, Mike Booms.  You got busted.  Andy.  Hey, one of my favorites has always been in Die Hard 2.  He's at the airport making a call from Dulles International, or what is now Reg International, and the payphone clearly says Pacific Bell.  Ah.  Oh, it's West Coast.  I've been Pacific Bell.  Wrong coast.  Wrong coast, guys.  So, there you go.  Oh, very good one.  All right.  I caught one film flub in Freebie and the Bean.  Yeah.  Where the tire tread was much more worn in the second part of the sea than in the first. 
[02:45:30]  Freebie and the Bean.  How did you know this, Ted?  Because I drive a lot, so I could tell if the height of the car was different because of the publicity of the sun.  Oh.  That's a good one.  Yes, it is.  I like that one.  He has a tread and worn.  You could always tell on movies like Smokey and the Bandit and all those movies when they were going to make a big move or a big turn or a skidding U-turn on the street. 
[02:46:00]  Because there would be the tire marks where they practiced it 50 fucking times.  I never noticed that.  I never noticed that either.  It's here.  Smokey and the Bandit.  There's so many of those.  Any Hal Needham car movie, cannonball run, all those.  You'd just see the skid marks where they practiced the move.  Fuck, I never noticed that.  Let's say hi to Mongo, the trucker.  Mongo.  It's been a while.  How are you, sir?  Good.  How are you?  There's two great ones.  First, in Top Gun, in one of the opening scenes where that commander on the carrier is in the, you know, when they have the first incident where he has to help the guy land. 
[02:46:30]  And he's standing there with his ribbons on, on his uniform.  And, like, the next scene, it's probably, like, two minutes later, he doesn't have any ribbons on his uniform.  Yeah, see, I love all that shit.  Blown off.  He took them off.  The other great one from Airplane's got a shitload of them.  In one of the first scenes where he catches up to Elaine, if you look on the left side, you can see a grip pulling cable out of the way.  Pulling cable. 
[02:47:00]  In the bar scene where he gets thrown out into the audience and then comes that big spring where you hear the springboard and he dances.  Yeah, we know this scene.  You can see him hiding back in the, hiding.  Oh, right, right.  I have seen that one.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember that one.  See him hiding in the crowd.  Thanks, guys.  Tell Sam if he doesn't find some of this stuff on YouTube.  I'm going to bite his fucking wrist.  Yeah, he really does need to be smacked for this.  Which one do you want?  Any one.  How about just film flubs?  Anything.  Enter.  Are you too busy, you know, preparing for your 10 o'clock show? 
[02:47:30]  No, I haven't prepared for you.  Aw, shit.  Let's go to Steve in Philly.  Steve.  Yes.  Hey, boys.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, Steve.  So in Pulp Fiction, when Samuel L. Jackson and Travolta walk into the apartment with the three guys and they get shot at, they miss.  Even before they get shot at, you can see the holes in the wall.  That one's huge.  Fuck.  That one is huge.  I didn't know that one either.  You can see the holes in the wall.  Before they even get shot. 
[02:48:00]  Because they had other takes, obviously.  All right.  Movie mistakes.  And those are the ones.  Dorothy's not wearing red slippers.  Oh, she doesn't have her little ruby slippers on.  Oh, shit.  Of the A-team, there's a drain.  What's this one?  Something with the headlights.  Friends.  Shirt's different.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  So I'm Phoebe spells her own name incorrectly.  What?  Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  All right.  Television shows.  Yeah, we want a good one.  What's Brad Pitt?  There's an airplane in the sky. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, God.  That's hilarious.  Come on.  Go back.  What is this?  It's called Movie Mistakes on YouTube.  No way.  That's where it was Achilles and...  Brad Pitt.  Yeah, it was in Troy.  It was awful.  Troy.  There's an airplane over.  Is that a jet plane?  They didn't have airplanes back there.  Come on.  They could have gotten that out.  Yeah, sure they could have.  Star Wars Stormtrooper bangs his head on the door.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, I've seen that one.  I like that.  I don't...  Is that like...  Oh, that's a camera guy.  That's a camera guy. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  During Harry Potter.  What a dummy.  What an asshole.  That made the final...  He looks like Martin Mull.  All right.  Star Wars full of mistakes.  Yeah, Star Wars.  I just didn't know what they were doing.  I caught a good one in The Empire Strikes Back.  Yeah?  Star Wars, yes.  Darth Vader's shoes had the tread was more worn later in the film than earlier.  I could tell by the way he was walking.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  It's just the music. 
[02:49:30]  I love that music.  I want that to play whenever I walk into a room.  Yes, you do.  How do you know, Desir?  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Fuck.  Look at this, X-Men.  White paper, blue paper.  That's crazy.  That's crazy, yeah.  Shit is nuts.  That's a big one.  I like the big ones where it's like fucking...  I wonder who's in Charmer Man in the middle of Harry Potter.  Stuff like that is...  The little stuff I don't give a fuck about too much. 
[02:50:00]  So now you gotta see The Little Fuckers.  I gotta see it now because it sounds horrific.  He's a crew member.  He's not a pirate.  What's he doing on a pirate ship?  Exactly.  Supposed to be Pirates of the Caribbean.  Where is he?  He's right there.  He's not even a pirate.  He's not a pirate.  He's got cowboy hat on, for God's sake.  You want to talk to Lydia about the thing?  Yeah, let's talk to Lydia.  Dr. Steve, by the way, real quick.  $309 million worldwide for Little Fuckers.  That makes no sense. 
[02:50:30]  That was only how much Steve spent to see it.  Because he went many times.  Yes.  Rich.  Dr. Steve.  We're all just followers.  We're just sheep.  I was...  Little fuckers.  Look, I ended up saying it.  They are...  And I knew it was a horrible movie.  I said, fuck it, let's give this a try.  Finally.  But how could you know?  Weird medicine.  Oh, weird medicine.  Ah.  He is the best.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe. 
[02:51:00]  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Joe.  The end of Teen Wolf.  Have you ever seen the celebration scene on the stands?  The guy's got his zipper down.  And he's waving his arms.  He looks down.  And he's got to zip it back up.  Right before the credits start.  Yeah, but wouldn't that just be part of a teen movie?  Maybe he was doing that?  Oh, look.  Oh, no.  That was a mistake.  What was that?  He had his underpants sticking out.  Yeah, that had nothing to do with the movie. 
[02:51:30]  That was a good one.  Oh, that is a good one, sir.  Sorry about that.  I caught a mistake in Teen Wolf, Gregory.  Teen Wolf?  Yes, I did.  Sir, stop interrupting me for Pete's sake.  I was explaining the Teen Wolf film flub I caught.  And I wrote to the director numerous times.  And what did you write?  I wrote that on one of the wolves' heads, there was 4,328,575 hairs, and there were three  less in the next scene.  You didn't feel like going with the numbers? 
[02:52:00]  Yes, I had to see the movie 14,881 times in the theater to count them accurately.  There's no way you could.  Everybody was yelling, down in front.  I was standing there with a pointer yelling out numbers.  Oh, you were yelling numbers.  I certainly was.  One, two.  Oh, sugar, it's all.  I have to come back for the next showing.  What a fucking asshole.  Let's go to Janine, North Carolina.  Janine. 
[02:52:30]  Hi, guys.  Hello.  Hi there.  Titanic, when Rose goes to hack the handcuffs off of Jax, when he's hooked up the pipe, you  can see how many times she missed up and down the pipe.  That shit is cool.  Practice shots.  Nice.  Good job.  See ya.  Bye.  Continuity is important in films.  It takes you right out of the picture.  Yeah, it does sometimes, right?  Yep.  What is that one? 
[02:53:00]  More from Titanic.  What the hell is she doing there?  Titanic.  Making mistakes.  Where's the Titanic?  It's a movie, though.  It did pretty well.  Oh.  It's where Jack and they're on the boat.  They're looking up in the air.  That's right.  And where's the big flub?  They had a stupid one-night affair.  Why make a movie around?  I know.  What are they looking at?  He fucked her in a car on a boat.  How much transportation does she need for her pushing it away?  What's the big mistake?  Where's the mistake in that one?  I'll look at a shorter video. 
[02:53:30]  Two mistakes that I found.  What did you see?  Well, I don't mean.  Well, this is, uh...  We're looking at two Titanic mistakes.  Something like ship in the background.  Let's see.  Here.  Get on it.  I see debris.  Yeah.  Have you noticed, if not remember, you were looking at the background, not the actors.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks.  Yeah, there's a ship.  It's sinking.  It's the Titanic, you fucking dumb whore.  It's the one they were on. 
[02:54:00]  Exactly.  This isn't fucking Lawrence of Arabia.  You're supposed to see a ship.  Movie mistake two.  Is it a wig?  Is it a wig?  Ah!  It doesn't come off.  What's a wig?  What is it?  The old lady walking.  Oh, yes.  You can see her hair under the wig.  Yes.  It's funny.  The wig blows up, and you can see her fucking hair.  Brown hair under the gray wig.  Couldn't they redo that?  You'd think.  They had such a big budget.  How lazy.  James Cameron is lazy.  He's a bum.  James Cameron's lazy.  Exactly. 
[02:54:30]  Look at the next Titanic blooper.  Yeah, this is not really good bloopers.  This is a fart.  This looks like a photo shot.  This is a fart.  Yeah.  Let's go to Lydia.  You guys could film flub yourselves.  Lydia.  Although, a lot in Back to the Future.  Let me take one more, because you like that Back to the Future.  Dan in Jersey.  Dan.  Later.  All right.  This is going to drive you crazy every time you see the movie.  At the end of Back to the Future 3, when Doc Brown comes in on the train back to 1985, 
[02:55:00]  you see his two kids, right?  The youngest one, he makes a hand motion, like, look at me,  and then he just starts pointing at his dick like Doc Brown's been touching him.  It's the weirdest thing you're ever going to see.  Come on.  Yeah, I haven't seen it.  Yeah, this is a famous one.  Look at this.  First of all, where did he build that train from?  It doesn't make any sense.  No.  Totally.  Fucking. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Oh, what happened?  How about you get right to the film flub, you idiot?  Shit.  I know.  Now you're just showing the movie.  Look at this little kid.  Look at his hand.  You see that shit?  Touched his penis.  He's just touching his weenie.  But look at him.  He goes with his hand, like, look at me.  Look, see, he's going, look at me.  Look at me.  This is my dick.  That's funny.  What a fucking little ass.  He matches whatever he made of it. 
[02:56:00]  Touch his dick.  Yeah.  It's a fucking horrendous franchise.  And your future isn't what you make of it.  Doc Brown, he proved that you can fuck things up.  Look, look.  What's he talking about?  He's my dick, asshole.  He seems too young to, like...  Oh, that kid was terrific.  He's looking right at the camera.  Look at his eyes.  He's looking right at the camera.  Like, like, like.  He's like, I'm about to show the camera in my dick right now.  He knows.  Camera, look, look.  Zoom in, zoom in.  That's my dick.  But he's doing, like, almost a...  Gotcha.  The universal sign of jerking off, too, right? 
[02:56:30]  Ah, that's hysterical.  And they make it against the law.  But they know.  Look, look.  Uncle Paul, that's my dick.  I know.  Oh, he's definitely looking...  Come here.  He's too young to see that.  That's hilarious.  And that is a good one.  He's doing the come closer.  Sure, come here.  And he's looking right at the camera.  Right.  Creepy grudge girl in mirror.  Ew, I don't know.  I want to see that.  I hate the mirror shit.  The grudge girl was creepy.  What was the mistake?  I hate mirror shit. 
[02:57:00]  There's no mistake.  No, it's just somebody reenacting.  Is it?  No.  That's the grudge girl, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did that really scare you?  That was scary.  That startled me.  Dude, that was scary, man.  I don't like that.  I don't like shit like that.  I don't like mirror shit.  That was really scary.  I'm going to go look at the kid pointing at his dick again.  Yeah.  Let's all get hard on.  Come on.  Let's laugh at this.  Watch the...  Come closer. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He goes...  Come here.  Come here.  Look.  Come here.  Here's my dick.  And he's laughing.  Gotcha.  What a fucking little asshole.  The best one is the last one where it's like the severe close-up.  There it is.  Look.  Come closer.  Here's my dick.  That's my dick.  Right there.  I want a little fuck.  Ah, creepy grudge girl in mirror. 
[02:58:00]  No, no, no.  Don't play that again.  Push play on that.  Just for a second.  Just for...  We didn't see it.  Oh, my God.  I don't like this one.  Girl looks in the mirror.  Just fixing her hair.  Checking her ears.  Yeah, you know.  52 million views this has.  Okay.  I don't like that.  I don't like that shit.  Go back to the dick kid.  Go back to the dick kid.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  Why is that bitch in the mirror?  I don't like this kid.  I don't like this kid.  Go to that bitch do it.  Go to the dick kid. 
[02:58:30]  Come on.  Is that Elizabeth Shue?  Yeah.  Love to fuck her in the ass.  It's my dick.  Now, that's funny.  That's not scary at all.  She was great in leaving Las Vegas when she was getting shitter-poked against her will.  She was wonderful in that.  Getting bent over a sink.  Shitter is my dick.  Getting her fucking perfect ass fucked.  Come here.  Come here.  Closer.  And here's my dick.  He touches it.  Pokes.  He pushes in, too.  Why is he doing that?  Why isn't he?  That's what every actor should do. 
[02:59:00]  Kid can't be more than 11, maybe.  He's nine and a half.  Nine and a half.  I'm sorry, Uncle Paul.  What's going on there?  We got Star Wars flubs.  We got Braveheart flubs.  Oh, there's plenty.  We got Lydia.  We got Stripes flubs.  Lydia?  What's Lydia?  That's a womb flub.  Hi, guys.  Lydia.  Happy Passover, everyone.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's what happened yesterday.  God damn.  I was in Waldbaum's near my neighborhood. 
[02:59:30]  I was in the Waldbaum's, and it was packed.  And it was just a bunch of people moving very slowly with their shopping carts, getting a matzah, and gefilte fish.  And the chopped liver.  And chopped liver.  Gefilte fish is horrendous.  Horrid.  All that Jewish food looks terrible.  Matzah is good.  Matzah is fucking great.  Gefilte fish, or however you say, gefilte fish is fucking reprehensible.  Horrid.  It looks terrible.  Why did Jews eat that?  They couldn't enjoy it. 
[03:00:00]  They've got to suffer.  You don't like ground-up pike?  Ugh.  Jesus.  Horrible.  Why would you?  No.  I don't.  So, Passover, by the way, tonight at dusk, right?  Sundown there?  Sundown, yes.  It starts, and what do you got planned?  Oh, well, I have the whole family coming over.  I'm making the horosis.  What is that?  What is that?  I hate that.  My uncle had that for a while.  Horosis.  Bad breath.  What is it?  It's chopped up apples and honey and nuts, and it symbolizes the mortar of the bricks 
[03:00:30]  that the Jews used to make the pyramid.  What the fuck is a mortar?  What are apples?  At least even the mortar.  What is a mortar?  A mortar, I'm sorry.  The mortar that they used?  So, really, you're eating honey, pretending it's fucking brick mortar?  Something like that.  Why can't you just eat something tasty, and it doesn't have to represent something?  Well, why couldn't the Jews just live one day back in the past without it meaning something?  With all these meanings.  We're very big on the symbols. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, shit.  And what, do you got to eat some bitter herbs and stuff?  Yes, indeed.  And what does that represent?  That represents the bitterness of our servitude to Pharaoh in Egypt.  Ah.  Why do you have to eat bitter herbs to remind you to Pharaoh?  A radish for everyone.  Why a radish?  Why, yeah.  But they're easier than cutting up the horseradish, that's all.  And don't you have to leave a seat open for someone?  For Elijah, that's right. 
[03:01:30]  Elijah, you leave a seat.  Wow, living with the Jews has given you an education.  Oh, believe me.  But do you look silly just sitting there with a fucking empty chair?  Of course you do.  And Elijah, by the way, he never shows.  He's always late.  And what, some asshole has to sit on the floor because you're saving that seat?  Ah, for Elijah.  For the magic man?  You should put a fucking dildo on the seat so when Elijah sits, he has a big surprise  for being late.  Oh, my God.  I don't even know who Elijah is.  Elijah is like our Jesus.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the head muck anymore.  All right. 
[03:02:00]  You might want to ixnay on the dildo, eh?  That might not be wise.  And what, like, how come you can't just have, like, a holiday ham?  Exactly.  All right, perhaps the wrong meat.  That's what Voss is.  No, no ham.  No, no.  So you eat bitter herbs and unleavened bread.  Now, what does the unleavened bread represent?  It comes after unten.  That is the masa.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  We just had an unleavened joke. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, boy.  That joke had no yeast.  What does the unleavened bread represent?  The masa symbolizes our hurry and our flight from Egypt.  There was no time to allow the bread to rise.  Couldn't put it on the back of one of them wagons leaving?  Yeah.  I guess not.  What, did everybody just grab unrisen bread and fucking have the door?  How big of a hurry were you guys in?  Quick, grab the flatbread and the radish. 
[03:03:00]  We got to go.  What's the matter with you guys?  Couldn't you buy bread when you got somewhere?  Your religion is as stupid as the rest of them.  It really is silly.  It's not easy being the chosen people.  Oh, my God.  So now you sit around.  You have the Passover Seder, right?  And lots of wine.  And lots of Manischewitz.  Well, I got a little chianti instead.  Oh, okay.  So you're not going to...  With some unleavened fava beans. 
[03:03:30]  Yes, and some radishes.  A census taker tried to leave in a hurry.  I gave him flatbread and radishes.  Fucking multiple begs throws kefilterfish juice in your eye.  He said, I can smell your kefilterfish.  How many people are you going to have over?  Because I notice in my neighborhood, there's a lot of people come over to people's houses. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, we have a small family.  We're only going to have about 13 to 15 people.  That's a lot of Jews.  That's a lot of people.  A lot of Jews in one house.  Yeah, that's nothing.  On Thanksgiving, we usually have 20.  Now, do you have an elder that kind of reads from the Torah?  We do.  We have the patriarch of the family.  Yes.  He would be my dad.  Unfortunately, he's an atheist.  Whoa.  Oh, good for him.  That must be a pisser for him to be in that house.  He just sits in the back and boos.  Everybody reads.  Boo.  Oh, shit.  He grumbles about tribal customs and banging drums. 
[03:04:30]  Kicks over Elijah's chair.  Yeah, exactly.  He sits in it angrily with his middle fingers up.  If he does show up, he's going to stand.  My house, my seat.  Giving up the good seats.  Exactly.  He's flicking lights on and off, and everybody else is just not using electricity, whatever  that would be.  So now he's an atheist, but he reads from the Torah?  Yeah.  Well, my dad, not from the Torah. 
[03:05:00]  We read the Hadadah.  Oh, the Hadadah.  What is that?  Yeah, that's the book that tells the story of Passover.  Isn't that just the Old Testament or something?  No, no.  It's a Harry Potter book.  The New Testament?  Which one is it?  It's a story.  It's a story.  Hey, I don't even know what's in there.  My name is Goldberg.  I have it right over there.  Hey, Lydia.  Lydia.  Hasn't other shit happened since the Egypt days?  And if new shit happens, can't you get rid of some of that old shit?  Yeah.  You know, that's a really good point. 
[03:05:30]  I mean, I actually have a lot of passages crossed out and some highlighted.  Why are you stuck with flatbread for eternity?  Because something happened back in Egypt.  Leaven that shit.  Like, why did the Jews eat a cookie to commemorate something that happened in 1978?  Yeah, maybe there was some big event that happened in 78.  Sounds delicious.  That's a good point.  Mm-hmm.  In the meantime, I understand Anthony has a stalker.  Ah, well.  Who knows?  What's going on?  Wait, you haven't been listening? 
[03:06:00]  There's just some girl that continues to text me.  Oh, yeah, the texting stalker.  I heard about this.  But now there's a new twist.  See, her texts have now, they're to other people, if you get my drift, other people.  But they're somehow being misdirected to me.  And they're about a lot of friends and what great time she's having and things like that.  And to me, all I keep texting back is, stop texting me. 
[03:06:30]  But I just love to know what this new tack is in someone's mind, why they would do something like this.  In the mind of a crazy person.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  True.  Let's back up for one moment and talk about the psychology of a stalker.  Most people who study this, and I'm not an expert on stalkers per se, believe that stalkers have obsessive personality disorder, which would fall under obsessive compulsive personality disorder.  Sort of like the things you dealt with with your mom, Opie. 
[03:07:00]  Except stalkers are seen as less severe in that the person of their affection becomes their obsession.  You know what's ironic about Lydia?  Her breasts had plenty of time to rise.  Sure.  Unlike the matzah.  Unlike the unleavened matzah.  Yeah, you got some leavened tits.  Yes, there was plenty of time.  She didn't worry about farro when she had those big cans put in, did you?  Exactly.  Basically what they're saying is, why aren't your tits as flat as your bread?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She grabbed two watermelons and shoved them under her bra, fucking headed past the pyramids. 
[03:07:30]  Fuck farro.  Got giant implants to commemorate the slave girl that grabbed the melons with the giant melons.  Her tits commemorate the big pyramids that they built.  Two giant, delicious pyramids.  I want to put my fucking farro-headed dick between them.  No disrespect.  Do your legs represent the Red Sea later on this evening?  That's right.  Because there's a lot of people walking between them.  Not this week.  No, huh?  Not this week. 
[03:08:00]  Uh-oh.  That's an ugly prospect.  What are you going to do?  Squat down and paint an X on people's doors?  See his period date.  Lamb blood.  Keeps the plague away.  Keeps that plague away, doesn't it?  Yeah, what's that about?  How do you commemorate that?  The lamb blood on the door.  I actually do not put lamb's blood on my door.  Do people?  I don't think people really do that.  Well, wasn't that a big thing?  It was so the evil would pass over you. 
[03:08:30]  And you decided you don't need to do that anymore, so why still the flatbread?  That's what we're getting at.  Well, every Jewish family always has a mezuzah at their door.  Right.  So, that sort of covers that, and we do have the shank bone of the lamb.  That symbolizes...  Oh, that symbolizes the lamb part of it.  So, there's a shitload of lambs walking around without their shank bone because you need some  religious thing to happen.  Poor little thing.  Exactly.  How do you live without the shank bone, Jimmy? 
[03:09:00]  You don't.  No?  No.  There's a great movie about lambs.  It was called Shankless in Seattle.  Just sad lambs yelling at Jews for taking their shank bone.  Their shanks.  So, the mezuzah...  If you guys didn't have such exciting wives, I would invite you and yours to the Passover.  I can't go.  Look, we beat up the Catholic faith a little too much in the show.  It's good that we go after another religion we don't understand.  And, by the way, this is not even going after it.  It is educating.  We're looking for understanding.  You're educating people.  Do you know, Lydia, you've just educated so many people on what Passover is? 
[03:09:30]  It's amazing.  It's so exciting to me.  Is it?  Are you all...  You're psyched?  I'm so psyched.  I'm going to use my binoculars tonight and peer through everyone's window in my neighborhood  and see how they're celebrating.  Last year, I saw a whole table, and there were some attractive, big-titted Jew girls  right behind me and to the left.  Jew girls have big tits but no nipples.  Be careful.  Really?  Well, it's not like I was going to do anything.  I was just going to look through my binoculars.  No nipples.  I'm telling you. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, she's looking right now.  They look like the yarmulkers.  In general, they're unfinished boobs.  They either have really tiny little ones or they're the same color of the rest of the  breast.  Really?  Really strange.  Oh, yeah.  You must be hanging out with the wrong Jews.  Research has shown.  Someone will back there.  It's very bizarre to me.  Hey, when you die, what happens to you if you're a Jew?  If you...  Jews don't believe in heaven and hell.  We believe that...  So that's what I want to get at.  So why bother them?  The only reason, as a Catholic, I bother with some of this stuff, just in case there might 
[03:10:30]  be that heaven.  The telling of the Passover story is a mitzvah.  A mitzvah is a good deed.  But...  If enough people do good deeds in the course of your lifetime, Elijah will come sit at the  table and heaven will come to earth.  Oh, heaven comes to earth.  He's not coming to the table.  Elijah is coming.  Shut up.  No, it's all garden nonsense.  Then why the empty seat next to you, Jimmy?  Why the empty seat next to you?  So that's what God is going to do one day when he finally makes it back or makes it for  the first time. 
[03:11:00]  He's going to fucking go to Ronkonkoma and sit on a metal chair and eat shitty fish?  I don't know if he's come to us tonight today.  Ronkonkoma.  Or wherever.  Well, how many seats do they think that he's going to sit in?  Everyone's got a seat.  What, is he going to plop his ass down in everybody's house real quick?  Not that Elijah, Sam.  He was great.  What we do is just like...  And the seat that is empty near Jimmy is for Elijah Daddy.  Exactly.  That's for Elijah or celebrities.  No, Elijah Daddy. 
[03:11:30]  Not Elijah Daddy.  So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I had a point to my question.  So you have one of those religions where you don't believe that anything happens after  you die.  So God, I wish I had that out.  It would make it so much easier.  Why would you practice anything on Earth if there's nothing when you die?  Because it's all about how you live your life on Earth.  Just live it.  So then if you live it...  But then why would you...  Hold on, hold on, Dan.  Sorry.  What are the consequences if you're not living as a good Jew? 
[03:12:00]  Ah, there you go.  Then you're not helping the community move forward to the number of mitzvahs we need to  bring Elijah.  So when Elijah comes back, right?  Yeah.  But it's so far after you're dead.  What happens to you?  I'm in the ground with the worms going in and out.  So it's only the people...  So you're trying to help out the people of the future by doing good deeds. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, man.  That's crazy.  Because I think most religions, they put up with a lot of stuff just in case.  But wait.  Because the Catholics are saying, look, you're going to go to heaven if you do everything  right.  So in the back of your head, you're like, hey, maybe I should go to church every once  in a while just in case.  Their religion, they know already there's nothing.  And they still practice.  That's crazy.  Catholicism works on rewards and consequences.  That's true.  Judaism works on a different philosophy, more of a communal philosophy.  But they all have nonsense in common.  That's the beauty of them. 
[03:13:00]  So are you hoping, like, what happens if Elijah comes back tonight?  He sits down in your chair.  I was so close my chair.  Now, are you looking at your big tits and be like, oh, my God.  Yeah, Elijah would just grab them and run out of the house.  And, Jim, you don't think he's going to pick her house?  Why would he?  Why would he?  She drinks too much.  She talks a lot.  No.  But what would happen to you?  If Elijah could look at that ample cleavage right there we're looking at.  What would happen to you if Elijah came back tonight?  Would you be one of these chosen few that actually get to, like, live on forever or something? 
[03:13:30]  I don't think it's about living on forever.  If Elijah came today, that would mean that today is Judgment Day.  Ah, Judgment Day.  Then what?  I don't know.  I don't believe in any of it, honestly.  To me, it's a cultural thing.  Get together with family.  Tell the story.  Ah, right.  That's fair.  But I'm not a big believer in all of that.  I'm too much of a scientist.  I don't have any faith.  What if God is a scientist?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Then everything's fine. 
[03:14:00]  We're all agreed.  That's what I say to the scientists out there.  I bet your husband thinks it's pretty hard to pass over those tits, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you.  All right.  So, Ann's got...  Did we finish up with Ann, too?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Whatever you do, I'm sorry.  Good enough?  Yeah, yeah.  She got to the point.  Lydia, one more question.  You're out there on Long Island.  What do you think as far as this serial killer goes?  Nice, huh?  That's pretty scary.  The beach is right down the road from us.  I take that... 
[03:14:30]  I used to take that road every day to work.  We all have a story.  How did you survive?  Exactly.  How did you survive?  But, you know, if you look at some of those communities...  She's just on Ocean Parkway.  The serial killer just keeps passing her by.  I hope Sam did that on purpose.  What?  What happened?  He's spelled serial killer as serial.  Of course.  I wanted to see if there were any funny pun pictures.  Yes.  You're fucking E-Rock murdering fucking Cocoa Puffs with his mouth. 
[03:15:00]  I'm surprised they haven't found hundreds of more bodies around there.  I mean...  Oh, well, what do you know?  Yeah, what do you know?  I have no inside knowledge.  Hey, man, you had a dead guy on the couch once.  I haven't forgotten.  That's true.  Maybe they put Bill over there.  I don't know what they did with him.  I thought he wanted it on.  Well, as a shrink or whatever the hell you are, what do you think?  What's the makeup of this guy?  Well, you know, I used to be a police psychologist.  I used to work for the New York City Police Department.  Yes.  All right, so you know this shit a little... 
[03:15:30]  All right, so what do you got on him?  Yeah, a little profile.  Well, serial killers are generally antisocial personality disorders.  Really?  They're generally...  As you know, white males, they tend to be charming.  Wow.  And able to lure victims by appearing to be somewhat normal.  Right.  You're adding nothing.  Would you?  Well, there's not going to be much that I can add to what you guys know about FBI profilers.  Where does he live?  Exactly.  What would be a profiler and all? 
[03:16:00]  I can't add much to that.  You certainly didn't.  Thanks.  Screeching halt.  Holy shit.  I guess that's why you guys are comedians.  I hope you lose your shag bone.  We just...  You didn't...  You added nothing, and you worked for, like, the FBI, basically.  Yeah, you're a psychological lady.  A psychological lady.  You're telling us all this stuff about serial killers.  Well, typically, they...  A lot of people, you know, like to kill...  I think he's the one who lives in the area. 
[03:16:30]  Of course he is.  I could have told you that.  No, I'm going to disagree.  I think he lives in Taiwan and comes in and out every day.  So he flies, kills, and gets back on the plane.  And by the way, this spoof of the Royal Wedding video, it fucking stinks, and it's not funny.  Oh, why?  I hate this.  And every asshole fucking news show is showing it.  Of course.  The Royal Wedding spoof dance.  Gives a fuck.  Well, that's based on the original viral video of that.  It looks like the same people.  They had a show Lady Di fucking dancing around a car in a tunnel in Paris. 
[03:17:00]  Long way to go.  Get it?  She's dead.  She's dead.  Not enough time, Jimmy.  Not enough time.  Are we done with Lydia?  Yes!  Yeah.  Always a pleasure, guys.  Have a great day.  Bye, Lydia.  Have a happy holiday.  Have fun awkwardly staring at that empty chair tonight.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Jesus.  Yeah, say hi.  I'm praying mantis walking in the hall.  Elijah comes in.  I saw that.  What the fuck is that?  It's just someone who hates themselves. 
[03:17:30]  Hey, how'd you enjoy your dessert?  That's terrific.  Good for you.  I've had one of those.  Those girls are not fun.  Oh, the worst.  When you're not making a lot of money and you take them to a dinner knowing they're going  to the bathroom to pee.  Oh, just.  That's not fun for anyone.  The fucking worst.  The hair all looks unhealthy.  What the fuck are you doing?  The fucking worst.  The hair all looks unhealthy.  What the fuck are you doing?  Unhealthy, shitty hair with no bounce or luster.  Got a couple teeth that look like they're going to fall out at any moment.  Of course they do.  Skin's a bit too white.  It's awful.  It's fucking horrendous, this video.  Horrendous.  Why? 
[03:18:00]  It's a big viral video.  It's cute.  It's not cute.  It's cute.  It's cute.  It's cute.  It's cute.  It's cute.  It's cute.  It's a fruit.  Look, there's the Queen Moon.  It's Prince Charles.  Oh, is that Prince Charles?  They're doing like an ass bump dance.  But it's not really them.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, it.  That's that.  You can imagine, though.  Imagine?  Wow, that's crazy.  Look, the Queen Mum.  And look at Prince Harry.  And I have a Prince Harry.  Prince Harry.  He's going nuts.  You fucking laugh at this shit. 
[03:18:30]  God, the people are just...  This should have three views.  Oh, they're all together.  God, what the fuck?  Unfunny.  When is this royal wedding?  It's this month.  Sometime.  I don't know, but it's not going to beat this.  No.  Wow, that guy looks like him, though.  That's what I'm saying.  They all look like him.  Prince William?  I'm in now.  Lookalike?  That fucking incest haven.  They all look alike in England.  Fucking buck-toothed idiots.  Incest haven.  Of course it is. 
[03:19:00]  Fucking one long, creepy bloodline.  Here comes his bride.  Wow, this is crazy.  Cool.  What's her name?  Kate Middleton?  Yes.  Yes.  Let's give her a good ass-eating.  You know he's never eaten her pussy right.  You don't think so?  No, he's too busy wearing riding outfits.  Fucking dumb royal family.  I have to hold my fork a certain way.  You give me five minutes with her, I'll have her fucking, I'll have her fucking on the 
[03:19:30]  first Virgin Atlantic fly.  I'll fly her business over here and fucking eat her ass proper.  I'll eat her ass savagely.  Proper.  Kate Middleton has never had her ass eaten right.  Propped up all nice and just like fucking lapped out.  I'll put three of my fucking drool pillows under her fucking box.  First I'll slap her pussy and say, shave this.  I'm not that fucking beaver tooth fucking incest idiot that you've been dating with his  mother and that fucking horrible cuckold she's been dating.  Fucking shave this awful thing. 
[03:20:00]  Shave this fucking thing.  And I'll lick it.  And then she'd go in and she'd shave and she'd get out.  Oh god damn.  And I'd give her fucking ass the eating of a lifetime.  That it deserves, right?  Yeah, you know Kate Middleton's asses.  She's never had her pussy eaten right.  No.  No.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  It really is a shame for her.  Of course it is.  Why do you think fucking, why do you think Lady Di was fucking doing 170 in the back  of a BMW with Dodie?  Because he had a big uncut dick and he'd probably slap her face with it. 
[03:20:30]  Oh yeah.  You know, I guarantee, the last thing she said before she died was this.  Oh.  She had a fucking mouth full of Dodie dick.  Dodie dick.  Disrespectful things.  It's not disrespectful.  Dodie was probably hitting it right.  Dodie dick.  Dodie was probably fucking her nasty.  I wish she was having a nice time.  Yeah, I'm sure she was.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, well.  Jimmy, are you promoting anything?  Something.  There's a couple of anti-social network shows on sale.  We have DC on sale, which is the 13th of, I think, May or June. 
[03:21:00]  And Vegas is on sale, and so is opening night at the Chicago Festival.  They're all selling well.  I want to go to Chicago.  Yeah, it's going to be a good one.  Can I go to Chicago?  Sure.  What is that?  Maybe get some of your comedy friends to also.  That's whatever the opening night of the festival is.  Go to antisocialcomedy.com.  Oh, is it like June, May?  It's in June, I believe.  June?  I want to go.  I don't know.  I should know.  Look at Chicago.  Oh, hold on.  Father Elo at the Oprah Winfrey's palace. 
[03:21:30]  The Elo.  All right, guys.  Welcome back.  Enjoy.  Happy Passover to all of our Jews.  June 15th.  June 15th.  It's Chicago.  I'll have that day off, because I'm fucking going to Chicago.  Chicago.  I've never been to Chicago.  You've never been to Chicago?  No, that's where I want to go.  Oh, it's a great fucking city, man.  This is perfect.  Yeah.  Go see a little comedy and see the city of Chicago.  Great restaurants.  It's one of my favorite places, honestly.  You can have one of those giant hot dog things.  What's their food?  Deep dish?  Deep dish pizza and one of those hot dog things, right? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  They built those giant fucking hot dogs.  What do you mean?  They got a hot dog?  Yeah, they top it off with a bunch of shit.  We got hot dogs.  No, no, it's not.  They make it like a meal.  It's giant, and it's got fucking all kinds of shit on it.  It's hearty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why every guy in Chicago has a fucking mustache like Mike Ditka and a fucking giant  heart attack stomach.  Big, fat, swollen guts like rocks.  Ah, shit. 
[03:22:30]  They eat worse than New Yorkers?  They eat worse than, yeah, of course.  Chicago's bad.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They fucking, whatever, they eat fish out of Lake Gitchaguni and everything else, that  stupid song, Lake Superior, whatever's connected to Chicago.  Wherever you go in Chicago, people tell you where the best deep dish pizza is, I bet.  I only eat-  Everyone has their place.  I never ate deep dish pizza there, honestly.  I used to love deep dish pizza.  You never ate it there?  It worked at one of those joints.  I ate at Chicago Pizza Pub.  At Jericho?  Yeah, in beautiful Huntington instead of Chicago. 
[03:23:00]  I fucking used to go there, too, man.  Yeah, yeah, I used to work there.  Two beers and a deep dish.  Yeah, it was great.  Pizzeria Uno's?  Nah.  Oh.  You can't get a Chicago deep dish there, right?  And Uno's?  I bet you can.  Not a real one.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  It's probably like being able to go to Chicago and get a New York pizza.  It ain't happening.  It's about right.  Ain't happening.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah.  I just needed someone to back me up on this, and hopefully he does, and then we could  go home, and I could rest.  Sergio in Jersey, go ahead.  Hey, Sergio.  Hey, guys, how you doing? 
[03:23:30]  Hey.  Ugh.  Hey, good morning.  Hey, listen.  Opie, light of the day, dude.  Funniest fucking thing.  Jewish girls, big titties, no nipples.  It's true.  No, I...  All it is is a fucking spot in front of their tits.  The funniest fucking thing.  You've never come across this ant?  I'm telling you.  Well, so to speak.  I don't think I've ever dated a Jew broad.  No, it's a blinking watermelon.  It's like nothing there.  It's the weirdest thing, too.  You want something that makes it look like it's a tit instead of a watermelon like this 
[03:24:00]  guy said.  I know the kind of tits you mean, but I never associated them with Jews or anybody else.  I've just seen them on different chicks.  Every once in a while.  Yeah.  It's so disappointing.  Let's bring in some Jew broads and take a look at their tits.  For Passover.  For Passover.  That's our homework assignment.  To bring in some Jew broads with no nipples.  Yeah.  Or if they have them, they're very light, so you can't tell they have nips.  That sounds good.  And hopefully they're lezzing out at that point.  That's what all the kids are doing.  Lezzing out.  What?  Oh, we didn't even bring that to the air? 
[03:24:30]  The Kings Park thing?  No.  We learned that.  Because I went to the Kings Park psych thing that they closed down.  Yeah.  And I saw teenage girls, and I knew they were just going there to lezz out.  What else do they do these days?  Lezz out.  They're just going in the woods behind some of the facilities, and they're going to lezz out.  All the kids are lezzing out these days.  I told you that before the show.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  You know they're lezzing out right now.  Oh, yeah.  Girls are lezzing out these days.  They're starting earlier.  Younger and younger, too.  They're lezzing out.  Like seven, eight.  I don't know.  Lezzing out.  That's illegal. 
[03:25:00]  Fucking idiot.  Well, I mean, any kid.  Everybody lezzes.  Lezz.  Lezzing out.  All right.  We're out of here, finally.  Yeah.  Let's take a hike.  No.  Stick around, by the way, because coming up in a minute, it's the shit hour.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Virus.  Sirius.  Sirius XM. </pre>
