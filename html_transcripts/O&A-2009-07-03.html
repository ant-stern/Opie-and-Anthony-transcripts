<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a multifaceted tribute to Tippy Tom, a recurring homeless guest who had recently passed away.  The show began with a montage of clips showcasing Tippy Tom's various appearances, including segments where he reacted to *Sophie's Choice*, making controversial comments about Nazis and discussing his own life; played blackjack against Anthony and staff, losing significantly; and participated in a chaotic game of  *Pyramid* with other unconventional guests, including Papa Rock, Sandy Kane, and Stalker Patty.  Throughout these clips, and indeed the entire broadcast, the hosts and staff frequently made jokes about Tippy Tom's appearance, hygiene, and behavior.  The tone was irreverent and celebratory, though tinged with sadness.  Keith "The Cop" was mentioned as having discovered Tippy Tom's body.

A significant portion of the show focused on graphic and humorous recollections of Tippy Tom.  One segment detailed an extensive description of Tippy Tom's feet, with money offered to him for keeping his shoes on and off.  Another segment involved a poorly executed game similar to *Pyramid*, featuring Judah Freelander from *30 Rock* as a guest, devolving into chaos with many off-topic diversions and inappropriate comments.  The strong smell of Lysol in the studio was noted.  This segment culminated in Tippy Tom removing his pants for $100, resulting in further crude jokes.  The tribute to Tippy Tom included numerous staff members sharing often lewd memories, recounting his fondness for asses and a past event where staff presented their buttocks for his review. A mock book-on-tape project featuring his voice was also mentioned.

Further segments highlighted other memorable Tippy Tom moments.  Anthony famously stormed out of the studio after Tippy Tom allegedly contaminated his chair, vowing revenge.  Audio clips were played featuring Tippy Tom reading aloud from pornography magazines, using highly explicit language and making sexually suggestive comments, sometimes in the presence of children.  A phone call with Lady Di, another recurring character, devolved into sexually explicit banter and inappropriate propositions from Tippy Tom.  This segment also involved Tippy Tom's first appearance on the show, the strong odor prompting the hosts to use Vicks VapoRub, and an apparent bathroom incident leading to his ejection from the studio.  Guests during this portion included Primetime Sam Roberts, Danny, E-Rock, and Keith the Cop.

Another segment covered Tippy Tom’s self-identification as gay since age two, discussions of his health (AIDS, Hepatitis C, liver cancer, and a recent hospital visit after a subway fall), and sexually explicit banter with Lady Di, including discussion of safer sex options.  Dr. Steve recounted a previous encounter with Tom, highlighting his extreme body odor contrasted with unexpectedly clean state during a prostate exam and his subsequent refusal of a follow-up appointment.  Keith the Cop confirmed Tom's hospitalization and a gangrenous foot injury.  A musical interlude featuring Tom singing Rod Stewart was attempted.  A planned "surprise" sexual encounter was instead given to the country band, Barley Scotch and Hasey Dixie, involving a male dancer performing a lap dance for Tom via phone from the hospital.

A final segment served as a full-fledged tribute.  Sam Roberts, E-Rock, and Danny discussed Tippy Tom's unique status.  Dr. Steve was present for a planned prostate exam for Tippy Tom, with significant audience participation, protective gear being worn due to Tom's odor.  Brie Olsen, a porn star, made a brief appearance before leaving early.  Tippy Tom’s singing of Willy Wonka songs, claims of buried millions, and a “golden buns” competition with Danny were highlighted. The prostate exam itself was featured prominently, with Tippy Tom initially reluctant but ultimately proceeding, offering commentary throughout.  The segment concluded with reflections on Tippy Tom’s death and the unexpected media attention it generated, and mention of a planned Tippy Tom wine tasting.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Recently, The Opie and Anthony Show suffered a tremendous loss.  A man whose contributions to the radio show brought good cheer to millions of loyal fans.  Tippy Tom, the lovable tramp who sang like an angel and smelled like a dumpster,  has moved on to that great big brewery in the sky.  Over the next several hours, The Opie and Anthony Show will look back on this one-of-a-kind derelict  and pay tribute to his lingering odor.  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents Tippy Tom.  The Man, The Stench, The Legend. 
[00:00:30]  And how do I say goodbye to what we had in the day?  The good times that made us laugh, out of ways and bad.  I thought we'd get to see forever, but forever's gone away. 
[00:01:00]  It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.  Sam, E-Rock, and Danny here from The Opie and Anthony Show, and we come to you with a heavy heart  as we bring to you the Tippy Tom tribute show entitled The Man, The Stench, The Legend. 
[00:01:30]  Over the course of this show, we'll be bringing you some of the best moments of our dear, dear homeless friend,  Tippy Tom, who we recently found out is dead.  Danny?  Unfortunately, yes, he is dead.  He died.  If anybody is unaware of the news, Tippy was actually found in a morgue by our own Keith the Cop on May, I think, the 6th.  You mean, no, no, no. 
[00:02:00]  Keith found him a few days ago.  Well, yeah, but he had been in a morgue since.  Yes, so a very sad, you know, bit of news that I received on the same day as Michael Jackson's death.  So it was double trouble that day, baby, and I'm very upset about Tippy.  He was definitely one of my favorite all-time guests out of anybody, celebrities included, Tippy Tom.  When Tippy Tom was in, it always, it felt like a half day.  It's like, I don't have to do anything today.  Tippy Tom is here.  It was just happiness all around.  He brought our joyfulness to the room, and we are celebrating his life throughout this show with some of our favorite and some of the best bits. 
[00:02:30]  I mean, we're doing a full show on Tippy Tom, and we actually had to cut stuff.  That's how much he brought to the show.  And E-Rock, what are we starting this thing with?  Yeah, like you said, we had nine years of material of Tippy Tom that we had to go through.  And we're going to start this show off with Tippy Tom watching Sophie's Choice.  Of course, of course, he reacted very emotionally to the film Sophie's Choice, and we were able to cue up the scene and get his reaction. 
[00:03:00]  So this is it.  Tippy Tom crying to Sophie's Choice, Sam, E-Rock, and Danny from the Opie and Anthony Show, a tribute to Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom, the man, the stench, the legend.  What was the last movie you saw?  Seen any good movies lately?  Lately, I don't know.  What was the last movie you saw?  Mother Jugs and Speed.  Say it again.  That was quite all right.  Yeah, what was the last movie you saw, Tom? 
[00:03:30]  I saw, let's see, let's see, let's see.  Let me get this in my head.  I'm taking up time, I know that.  It's all right.  The movie.  Ask me what movie I like the most.  Tippy, what's the movie you like the most?  Okay, I'll give you the actress's name, and it broke my heart. 
[00:04:00]  Okay.  He's rubbing his chest.  Meryl Streep.  Meryl Streep.  What's she playing?  A lot of movies, Tom.  You got to give us a little more.  Iron Weed.  Kramer.  Meryl Streep.  Kramer versus Kramer.  Oh, no, that was an old one.  All right, which one?  It was the one with the daughter.  What was it?  No, the one where she was in the Nazi, German camp. 
[00:04:30]  The Nazis had her.  They're German.  I'm German, and I'm embarrassed about how Germans do this stuff.  Shame on me.  But I didn't do it.  I'd be embarrassed about being German.  Yeah.  Well, my name is Schultz.  Schultz?  No, with Meryl Streep.  She was in the Nazi Contrapressure camp. 
[00:05:00]  And it was, oh, my God, help me.  The Deer Hunter.  Oh, that was another one.  What movie is he talking about?  I'm going to work on Meryl Streep.  Come on.  Sophie's Choice.  Sophie's Choice.  No, what the movie was about?  What was it about?  She had two children.  Two children. 
[00:05:30]  And the Nazis took her, and they said, you can't go with both of them.  You know who she gave up?  Who?  Her girl.  The daughter.  They keep the boy.  That was Sophie's Choice.  How do you have to be a mom and have to do that?  Why do you all give up?  And Nazi Germany, that's how they were. 
[00:06:00]  You only have one kid.  How emotional he's getting.  Terrible, terrible thing.  What happened to the other kid?  I don't know.  But what I know is that Sophie Meryl Streep gave up her daughter to save her son.  Was she Jewish?  Is that it?  So, I don't know if she's Jewish or not. 
[00:06:30]  She's German.  And, you know, but that's what happened.  So, you don't like the Nazis, right?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, really?  I love the Nazis.  They're great.  He's killing you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I really like them guys.  Right.  I can't wait to hang out with them.  Well, Tom, get the fuck out of here.  Oh, Jesus, Tom. 
[00:07:00]  Watch the words.  Now, Tom, she had to give up her kid, which is a big, but didn't you, in a way, do the  same thing?  Not for the Nazis, but didn't you do the same thing when you kind of came to New York and  you're drinking and you kind of gave up your kid?  Tippy's choice.  Yeah, Tippy's choice.  Tippy's choice.  You gave up your kid because you didn't want him to know that you were a little flaky,  right?  Yeah.  Tom, you told us earlier.  You had to give up a kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I made sure my kid was with his mother.  Don't you wonder how he's doing in school or what is, like, sports he plays? 
[00:07:30]  Grandmother.  I did the best I could.  We were going through a divorce.  What do you do?  You go through a divorce?  You come talk to me when you go through a divorce and we'll discuss what's going on.  But don't you call him?  What are you going to do?  Give him a call.  So I give a kid, the mother, and I pay child support.  Oh, you did?  Of course.  What is that?  I'm not.  I was just asking, Tippy. 
[00:08:00]  Right?  He just...  I was just asking.  You did?  I got money.  I don't need nobody's money.  You do?  I come out here and just play.  I got my own.  You don't know who I know.  Oh, really?  So you got your own deal set up where you make money and stuff?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  We have a guy named John Lehman.  Ooh.  The John Lehman? 
[00:08:30]  No.  I didn't know him.  Herbert Lehman?  Who's he?  I don't know.  You just mentioned your name.  Herbert Lehman is John's father.  Uh-huh.  I don't know who these people are and you can't really...  The fucking millionaire!  You don't know Lehman Brothers?  Of course we don't know Lehman Brothers.  But you don't have to curse us out.  So you have some investments, I guess.  You're that right, I do.  Yeah?  Child support.  They open the envelope with the hubcap and some grass. 
[00:09:00]  Hey, Tom.  Sing us out of here.  We got to go.  That's it for us today.  Give us a little song as we leave everybody today.  Maybe something a little emotional.  We went a little emotional there for a few minutes.  All right.  Give us something a little emotional.  Let me hear a song.  No, just something in your head.  Something emotional.  Come on.  Feel it.  Something slow and nice and tugs at the heartstrings.  All right.  Take us out.  I'm working on it right now.  Take us out.  Timmy Tom's going to sing us out.  It's an emotional song.  Let's say. 
[00:09:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Feel it, Tom.  There's so many of them.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Wishing you were here, my baby.  Wishing you were here by me.  Yes, I know.  Yes, I know.  Wishing you were here.  Don't you know I love you so?  Don't you know I care? 
[00:10:00]  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Don't you know I care?  That's it.  All the lyrics is it.  That's it.  But I got all the wounds.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you.  That was very touching.  That's a pretty song.  That was good.  Tibby Tom, everybody.  I know who sang it.  Tom.  Tom.  What, sir?  All right.  We want to show you a clip.  Jimmy suggested that we get you a couple of clips that you might like today. 
[00:10:30]  Can you see the big screen right there up top?  I am.  Sam, point to the screen.  You should be.  Okay.  It's on all screens.  All right.  Look at the screen.  Tell us what's going on.  Well, that chick I don't like.  But earlier you said you liked her.  Well, she's okay.  Oh, God.  The studio is filling up.  Okay.  Hey, oh, we got Nazis here.  Oh, what are you showing those Nazis shit?  About the Germans? 
[00:11:00]  Nazis.  No, that's, um, that's, this is your favorite movie.  No.  Sophie's Choice.  Look.  Well, no, Sophie's Choice is very different.  No, look.  See?  It's Meryl Streep.  It's the daughter.  You're right.  Here it is.  Here's your movie.  You're right.  Look at that fine gentleman.  All right, listen to the movie.  No, he's a handsome man.  Tom, listen to the movie.  Here we go.  This is a Polak. 
[00:11:30]  You.  This is also one of these drecking communists.  We'll play in the scene that made him cry earlier on the show.  Where Meryl Streep has to give up one of her kids.  I hope so.  Yeah.  We're watching the version dubbed in German. 
[00:12:00]  This is not the English version.  No, he's coming to here.  That Nazi son of a bitch.  Look, I'm German.  And I don't like what they did.  What did they do, Tom?  Because no one speaks fucking German here.  They killed people.  He's kind of communist.  I can speak German.  You might as well stop it.  No one can understand it.  He's kind of communist. 
[00:12:30]  I speak Spanish and German.  I mean, Steve from Bayshore.  I love Germany.  I love America.  Right.  This is the end of the movie.  Like, some of it's in English.  Some of it's in German.  And this part happens to be in German.  There's no subtitles on this particular clip.  Uh-huh.  I guess you're supposed to know what's going on kind of a thing.  And Danny's not happy now.  What?  The Germans are wrong. 
[00:13:00]  The Germans are wrong.  But they did.  What they do.  Tommy, this is your favorite movie.  Explain what's going on because we don't know German.  Tell us what's going on.  The only good thing the Germans did is build a Volkswagen and a Mercedes-Benz.  That's all I ever did right.  And I'm German.  Right.  Well, this is...  My name is Schultz. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, Tippi.  That's German.  This is the scene that got you sad.  Here it comes.  The Nazis talking to Meryl Streep as she's holding her daughter.  What's going on?  Tell us.  She's protecting her child.  Here we go.  Here we go.  They're going to steal her baby.  It's a tragic movie.  No.  This movie broke my heart. 
[00:14:00]  They stole her baby.  Because it's not the kind of radio camp in German.  No.  No.  It's terrible.  It broke strictly German.  That movie's so tragic. 
[00:14:30]  It was wrong.  The Germans were wrong.  And I'm German.  And I'm wrong.  I didn't do that.  I would never do that.  That was your people, though.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, I was raised that way, but I'm not that way.  Tom, why are you so upset?  I don't get it.  Yeah, you got so upset watching that clip. 
[00:15:00]  Why are you so upset?  There's tears in your eyes.  It was wrong.  Why'd they take the little baby?  It was wrong.  What was wrong about that?  I'm sure he was taking the kids to get some good health care or something.  In those times, things were different, I guess.  You ain't gonna boo that shit now.  Why'd they take the baby, though?  The little baby got taken.  Oh, look.  She's...  Oh, no. 
[00:15:30]  Look, here's the scene.  This is what follows you?  Yes!  It's Mel Streep!  It's still her baby!  That's wrong!  No!  No!  Hey!  I would...  I'd go fight!  Yeah? 
[00:16:00]  Fight those Nazis?  That's a funny movie, right?  Do you laugh when you watch that movie?  That's funny.  I like movies, yeah!  What a rebound.  Wow.  I want to get busy. 
[00:16:30]  I want to get busy.  Busy.  Busy.  Busy.  Busy.  Busy.  I want to get busy.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[00:17:00]  Hey!  We'll return with more of Tippy Tom.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  Tippy Tom.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Hey!  Well, want to try this Tippy Tom one?  Let's try one for Tippy Tom. 
[00:17:30]  He just wrote this.  Oh, his name is Tippy Tom.  And he's a drunken effing dork.  He's probably taking a dump on every corner in New York.  His teeth are kind of hairy.  His brain no longer thinks.  And an hour after he leaves, the room's still effing stinks.  There you go.  We hope you enjoyed the fresh air.  Now get back into the stinky with Tippy Tom. 
[00:18:00]  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the man.  The stench.  The legend.  A tribute to Tippy Tom here on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm Iraq.  Primetime Sam Roberts and Danny are also here.  This bit, it's funny on the radio, but there's also a video attached to this.  Well, we're celebrating the life of the late, great Tippy Tom who passed away recently, our homeless friend.  And yes, this is another, that's the thing about Tippy Tom. 
[00:18:30]  Most of his bits were something you could enjoy heartily on the radio and then come home and find some kind of visual to go along with it.  And this is no different.  No, this is Tippy Tom playing blackjack in studio.  I mean, Danny, he liked to gamble.  Tippy Tom liked to gamble.  He gambled his life away.  I mean, if, you know, for those who know the Tippy history out there, you know, Tippy lived in Reno, Nevada, believe it or not.  And he had a window cleaning business.  And like the beginning of the end, or I guess the beginning of the beginning of Tippy Tom. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Was out in Reno having money and kind of, you know, developing a gambling problem.  Just like hustling.  So what do we do?  The great opiate Anthony show, the scumbags that we all are.  Right.  We decide, hey, let's have him play blackjack.  Yeah, we find out.  For beer, no less.  Yeah, we find out he has a gambling problem, so we send an intern out to get a deck of cards and make him play blackjack for beer.  Laugh and cry as we listen to Tippy Tom play blackjack on The Man, The Stench, The Legend, a tribute to Tippy Tom.  I want to play some cards. 
[00:19:30]  Tippy Tom, The Man, The Stench, The Legend.  Hey, Tom, you want to do some gambling today?  Whoa, what kind of gambling?  We're thinking 21.  Card playing?  A little blackjack.  A little blackjack?  You probably could use a few bucks.  I'm pretty goddamn good at blackjack.  Yeah?  Do you have a system?  No, I just know how to play.  Well, how do you know how to play?  Like, what do you mean by that?  I live in Reno, Nevada for half my life.  Oh, that's where the gambling problem came from. 
[00:20:00]  I'm sorry.  I wasn't calling you stupid.  I was just trying to, you know, hear about your technique for winning money at blackjack.  What's your technique?  I don't know.  Jack, I have a special card.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, I'll pull it out to make sure I win.  Really?  What's that special card?  Well, I make sure the deck is the same.  I get the same deck cards.  Yeah.  And that way there.  When they give me a hand, I'll put my cards in the hand. 
[00:20:30]  And that way there.  Boom.  All right.  How are you going to beat me?  All right.  How many hands of blackjack do you want to play?  I don't know.  I'll play all night.  Anyone want to donate?  Anyone want to donate?  What is it?  Ten bucks a hand?  Well, it depends on what we're spending.  Well, we'll put up the money.  You got to beat.  I guess you got to beat Anthony.  I'll beat Anthony?  You got to beat. 
[00:21:00]  I'll beat Anthony.  Right.  You got to beat Anthony at blackjack.  I can't go over there.  Well, I don't know.  It's just going to be a long deal.  No, you can go over there and play.  No, I can't.  I don't think I can.  Come on.  It's not that bad.  Well, I don't want to ask for a couple of hands.  I don't.  Can I get a word in here, please?  Try to.  We got a table.  We got a card table set up in front of us.  I don't want to win that fast.  Huh?  I want to enjoy the game also.  And if I lose little, that's okay. 
[00:21:30]  But I want to make sure that I get all your loot and not why you're all broke.  So you're kissing my ass.  And that's right there.  All right.  Are we going to play blackjack or what?  We got cards?  Yeah.  I have back cards with me now, but I'll get some.  How are we going to do this?  Anthony's got to sit by the thing.  Yeah.  I got to go over there somehow.  Somebody hook up a mic for Anthony.  There's a mic over there.  There's a table in between you and Tom.  That's easy.  It's too close. 
[00:22:00]  That's easy.  That's so bad.  Tiffy Tom play cards.  Is there any headphones jack over there?  I like how he says things like that.  Tiffy Tom play cards.  He's very third-person oriented.  Yeah.  Right.  I want to shuffle them.  You want to use his headphones?  No.  And I don't want shuffling either.  No, the dealer shuffles.  Oh, the dealer?  Yeah.  How do you know I trust that dealer?  He may have slipped me what I want. 
[00:22:30]  You got to take our word for it.  Oh, so I got to play that way.  Yeah.  Got to play that way.  Suppose I'll lose my money.  Well, then you'll lose your money.  That's gambling.  That's how you lost everything.  Then I'll be broke.  Let's get there.  Oh, this guy know how to shuffle right now.  Oh, thank you. 
[00:23:00]  You accept.  All right, Tom, we're going to play six hands of blackjack.  Who's playing blackjack?  I'll put up $10 a hand.  All right.  If you beat Anthony, you get the $10.  Simple as that.  Where's the $10 coming from?  I'll throw it right on the table.  Don't worry.  Oh, no, way over there.  And how many beers?  Oh, no, way over there.  Thanks.  How many beers?  And you got six.  Tom.  This guy might be slick.  Tom, you got six beers.  We got a bucket. 
[00:23:30]  Tom, here's the deal.  If you lose, we're going to give you a six pack.  Well, I just want a beer.  All right, listen.  You got to win the beer.  Wow, look at all those.  Well, I'm working on a beer right now.  Listen.  If you win the hand of blackjack, this is what happens.  You win the $10 and you get a beer.  If you lose, I get no beer.  Wow.  You are good.  I finally got a whip.  Oh, you did.  Wow.  All right, Tom.  I want to know who the deal is. 
[00:24:00]  Danny's got a deal.  It's Danny.  He's legit.  Stanley's legit.  Yeah, Stanley.  Stanley is legit.  We got a bucket?  It's Stanley.  I'm the biggest fan.  I want to know.  Listen, Tom.  You lose the hand of blackjack.  You don't get the $10 and we pour one of your beers out that we're giving you.  That's not nice.  I know it's not nice.  Yeah, it's not nice.  It's not nice.  All right, who's going to be in charge of the beers?  We're not hurting your feelings. 
[00:24:30]  We're just playing.  It's a gamble.  You got to have something at stake to make it interesting.  Yeah.  All right.  Beers, that's a good stake.  All right.  Who wants to play?  Tom, here's your first $10.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Going down.  Don't touch it.  Oh, shit.  You beat Anthony in this hand of blackjack.  You get that $10 and you get to take a beer off the table.  Who's Dylan?  Me.  All right.  Mike.  He's Dylan.  Travis.  Yeah, get a mic in front of you.  Mike.  This could be very profitable for you.  Mike Dylan? 
[00:25:00]  Nope.  No, that's a mic.  Now, Stanley.  Mike, are you Dylan?  Oh, God.  All right.  Here we go.  Jesus.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold your mic.  Here we go.  Mike, are you Dylan?  Yeah.  Okay, give me the right hand.  Stanley.  So I can win.  All right.  Here we go.  I'll split it with you.  I guess one up.  Something like that.  Okay.  He got it.  One up, one down.  One up, one down.  Anthony versus Tippy Tom. 
[00:25:30]  A little 21.  We don't really need the deals.  Oh, I already won.  No, it's just.  Oh, we'll just play against us, too.  Yeah.  That's great.  That's all right.  We'll just take those and bury them.  All right.  Tippy Tom, look at your cards.  I want one more hit.  One more hit.  Keep the cards on the table, sir.  Yeah, keep the cards on the table.  We heard about your cheating.  And where's your up card?  I'm good.  All right.  Tippy Tom's good.  Let's see how.  All right.  Hold on.  He's better than me. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Tippy Tom's good.  He would have had to leave his up card.  I'll take a hit.  All right.  Anthony's taking a hit.  I'll stay right there.  All right.  Anthony's staying.  Come on.  All right, Tom.  Come on.  Tom, what do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got?  I got 19.  I got 20.  Where's that?  You got 19.  You got 19.  You got 10.  You got 10, a 3, and a 6.  Count.  That's 19.

And because you didn't win, we take one of your beers.  I didn't win.  And.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Tom.  One of your beers just gets dumped.  Now it's garbage.  Yeah, all right.  All right, next hand.  That's all I want.  Another 10.  That's all I want. 
[00:30:00]  You would be great in Vegas.  Another $10 on the table, Tom.  All right, Tom.  All right.  Another 10 on the table.  Did he have to give back his 10?  He should be able to give it.  He should have to give back the 10.  Yeah, but the fucking listener killed me.  I'm getting busy.  I really want that 10 back.  I'm itching right now.  I'm messing around now.  All right.  You're not messing around.  I didn't live in real Nevada half my life for no reason.  All right, Tippi.  Here's the next beer.  It's nice.  We got four beers left on the table. 
[00:30:30]  Nice and cold.  I'm a lot of shitty.  And another 10 on the table.  Here we go.  Next hand.  All right, Jack.  Tippi Tom versus Anthony.  All right.  Tippi Tom showing a 10.  A 10.

And he's smiling at you.  Why are you getting a car or are you staying?  I know where I'm going.  I don't have to go nowhere.  You're staying? 
[00:31:00]  You're damn right.  All right.  I got 20.  What do you got?  Oh, my God.  We're even steaming.  Another push?  Another fucking push.  All right.  We pushed.  All right.  You got lucky there.  Tom's enjoying yourself.  You got lucky there, Tom.  I want that $10 bill.  All right.  We're going to play for that $10 on the table.  Tom should have to put his $10 up at one point, too.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he would have to put his $10 up against the beer.  Well, I'll put $10 up sooner or later.  All right.  When I get your money. 
[00:31:30]  We'll do a double or nothing at the end.  All right.  Here we go.  That's what we'll do.  All the money he wins, double or nothing on one hand.  All right, Tom.  Here's the next $10.  Here we go.  All right.  Tom is showing a $7.  And I got a king of diamonds.  I'm going to take another hit, though.  All right, Tom.  Oh, that could be good.  He's got some fucking good cards.

You don't mess with me.  I'll share this with you.  No, that's okay.  I'm fine.  Tom's beating Ant.  Ant can't focus because of the smell, though.  Oh, wow.  No, we're kind of tied right about now. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, you're right.  Tom, here's your next 10 on the table.  Here you go.  Come on.  Next 10 on the table.  Let's get busy here.  Mm, this is a...  All right.  Cut the deck of hands here.  We got two beers left on the table, Tom.  All right.  I want to win them beers.  All right.  You've won two beers so far.  20 bucks.  Doing pretty good.  All right.  Yeah.  I want $10, too.  All right.  Here we go.  Here it is.  Steal the cards, Stanley.  Tom's showing a nine and showing a two. 
[00:34:00]  I'm showing a deuce.  What he got?  I'm showing a two.  Oh, man.  I might break if I hit.  Want to give it a shot?  Let's give it a go.  Oh, boy. 
[00:34:30]  It's a two.  Oh, my God.  I got it.  I got it.  You motherfucker.  He just got a two.  You can't fuck me, Timmy Tom.  He's showing 11.  Yeah, my God.  And showing a two right now.  You want another hit?  No, I'm good with that.  All right.  I'm going there.  He ain't going to wait on money with that.  All right.  Give me a hit there.  He's going to lose.  Ah, damn it.  All right.  Oh, shit.  What did Tom have?  16. 
[00:35:00]  16.  I just had a 12, so I had a hit on it.  16.  You hear that?  You're fucking killing me here.  That's right.  Come on.  Look, they got money.  There's another 10 and another beer for Tom.  This isn't working out too well for us.  Oh, man.  See?  How did he hit that with a two and stick on 16?  He's a better player.  He sticks on 16.  No, he's one of these cocksuckers that fucking end up next to me.  I need another 10.  Where's Kevin?  He's staying on a 16.  He's giving you a fucking thrashing.  I got to make a bet.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  Here's your next 10 there, Tom.  Let's see what Tommy can do now.  All right.  All right.  I just put some money up.  We're going to let you put up all your money at the end for one hand.  Double or nothing, I think.  It's going to be a big one.  This guy might be really good.  He might win.  All right.  So I'm a little scared of him.  So I'm not sure.  All right.  Here we go.  Ant versus Tippi Tom.  Tippi showing a queen.  Ant showing a five.  All right. 
[00:36:00]  Looks like I want to win again.  Shit.  Are you staying?  I'm holding right now.  All right.  I need a card.  All right.  That broke.  No.  No good.  No.  I didn't break yet, sir.  I think you broke.  I need another.  Oh, Ant needs another.  Show him 14.  He ain't got no.  Oh, my God.  How did he get that?  I'll stay there on 18.  Oh, shit.  Tom, what do you got? 
[00:36:30]  Actually, it's 17.  Oh, it's a push.  How much you got?  I got 18.  Did he beat you again?  You're killing me.  What you got?  You're fucking killing me.  I said 18, but I have 17.  I got 18.  I'm staying here.  You won, Tom.  You won, Tom.  All right.  That's my money?  Yes.  That's your money.  That's right.  Just more beer.  And another beer.  Fucking me.  Now, here's the deal, Tom.  Here's the deal, Tom.  Tom, focus. 
[00:37:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  I'm playing poker right now.  You can put poker.  We're done with the beers.  You can put all your money on the table for one hand, double or nothing.  Here it goes.  Double or nothing.  Take all the money you just won out of your pockets.  Put it on the table if you want.  Of course I will.  Or you could just walk away with the money.  Take my one.  Nah, where I go?  All right.  I mean, walk away was kind of figurative, but.  All right, Tom.  Where am I going to go?  Yeah, I'm going to go.  Where?  Put your money on the table, then. 
[00:37:30]  I'm going to stay here.  Tom, put your money on the table.  Who's playing?  Put your money on the table, Tom.  One hand, double or nothing.  All the money you won.  All the money you won.  Count it up.  And the beers.  Get all the beers back on the table, too.  Get all the beers on the table, as well.  God damn, he drinks them fast.  Yeah, this is all.  All right.  It's a bit of a problem for him.  Did you think he was a moderate drinker?  All right, Tom.  Put your money on the table.  How much money you got?  All right.  No, I'll match your money. 
[00:38:00]  Let's see.  No, we'll match yours.  How much you got?  How much you got?  I forgot how many hands you won.  No, no, no.  He won 40.  Take your 10 back, Oak.  Yeah, okay.  Put your money.  Now, how much do you have?  40?  He won 40.  I ain't got that much.  Put your money on the table.  We're not going to take it.  All of it?  Count it up.  Yeah, we're going double or nothing right now.  Double or nothing on what you want.  So, you could win twice as much.  How about $10?  No, no.  You got to do it all.  All or nothing, Tom. 
[00:38:30]  What should I do?  Keith, what should you...  Double or nothing sounds like...  You could walk away with like 80, 90 bucks.  You could walk away with a lot of money, bro.  It's all up to you.  Double or nothing.  20 bucks.  No, it's got...  Where the match at?  All right, well...  You don't trust that?  Why are you putting that back in your pocket?  Why, I'm putting it all of you?  You only got to play it all.  Keith gave me money.  20 bucks.  You got to play it all.  All right, we'll do it 20 bucks.  All right, so, Tom...  But then he walks away with something.  I might need to have something in my pocket. 
[00:39:00]  Tom?  Guess I lose.  Double or nothing.  But if I'll fucking win...  Tom, here, look.  Take a bet, Tom.  Take a gamble.  That's $100.  All your money.  All your money that you have in your pocket right now  against this $100.  All the money and all the beer.  All the beer?  Yeah.  All the money and all the beer  against my $100.  So I have nothing in case you win.  Or you get all the money that you have, 
[00:39:30]  all the beer, and another $100.  No.  Ant's putting up $100.  You put up the money.  Why don't you win?  If I win, that's gambling, bro.  Then you have nothing.  Well, let's just play with this.  No.  We've got to go all or nothing.  That's why I'm putting up $100.  That's a good deal.  You've got $40.  You only got $40.  You're going to walk out with $140.  You're going to walk out with $140 in all these beers.  Suppose I lose.  Well, that's...  I should have thought about that 20 years ago. 
[00:40:00]  See, that's...  I go for it.  That's gambling.  You're getting odds here.  You're actually getting odds.  Tom.  And we'll double the beers, too.  So you've got three on the table.  You'll get six beers.  All I got is $40.  It should be $40.  $20, $30.  It should be $40.  I think he's fucking cornhole in a goddamn $10.  Put it up.  Come on.  If I'm putting up $100, you've got to put up the entire $40.  Tom.  We've been keeping $10.  There it is.  Put the $40 down here. 
[00:40:30]  Keith's got to be the keeper of the cash.  $40.  All right.  Put the $40 on the table.  This is what...  Listen to me.  Keith is the keeper of the cash.  Wait.  I don't want to wait until he puts his money up.  Leave him with a buck.  I got a buck for you.  Yeah.  Keith's got a buck for you.  All right.  Give the money to Keith.  Give me all the money.  All the money.  All right.  You got $40.  Stop trying to cornhole.  Give me that.  Tom.  Here's $100.  $140.  There's the pot.  Listen to me.  Tom.  Focus.  Tom.  Hey.  Where's my beer at?  All right.  You got your beer.  Listen.  Tom.  You win this hand of blackjack.  You're going to win the $140. 
[00:41:00]  All this money.  And you're going to win all the...  Why are you doing that at money?  Listen.  And you're going to...  I remember you.  Let it be noted.  He was pointing at me.  I remember you.  And Tom.  You're going to win all these beers as well.  $140 and six beers if you beat Anthony on one more hand of blackjack.  One hand.  Here we go.  All right.  Come on.  Here we go.  Come on.  Or nothing.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Here it is.  Big hand.  Tom's showing a three.  Tom's showing a three.  And showing a ten. 
[00:41:30]  Hold on.  Another hit.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Are you taking a hit?  Okay.  This is it.  All right.  That's it.  I don't think it'll work.  What do you got?  What do you got, Tom?  Seven.  Is he staying?  You're hitting?  13, 14, 15, 16, 17.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Let me look.  He might beat me.  Let me look.  Let me look.  Let's make sure.  Let me look.  Let's take a look at what you got, Tom.  He has 14.  He's got 14.  He's got 14.  Oh, man.  How much do you got? 
[00:42:00]  You have 14.  I have a 10 showing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I go one more.  It's 14.  14.  And showing a 10.  Yeah.  He's showing a 10.  He's showing a 10.  What do you think, Tom?  So we go in?  Big decision.  We got to go one more card.  I would go one more.  Big decision.  So we go for another card?  I go for another card.  All right.  $140.  Hold on.  $140 at stake.  Six beers.  Six beers.  Tom's thinking of hitting on 14.  14. 
[00:42:30]  Here we go.  That's 7 and that's 14.  I'm showing a 10, so he's got to hit on a 14, right?  All right.  Give him a card.  Here we go.  Want that one more?  You better feel right, man.  I'll get my gun.  14.  14.  Oh!  He pulls a six.  Holy shit, he pulls a six.  Oh, shit.  We're talking 20.  Tom's got 20.  Tom's got 20.  What do you think?  Who's going to kick my ass?  Holy shit.  Hold on.  Let's see what's going on. 
[00:43:00]  You're good at 20, right, Tom?  You're staying on 20?  All right, listen.  Hold on.  Ant, we got $140 on the table.  Six beers.  Tom's got a 20.  Anthony, it's to you.  Tom?  Blackjack.  There's your husband, man.  I'll take my money back.  And dump all the beers.  Oh, Tom.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Holy shit.  Oh, no.  What a devastating loss for Tippi Tom that was.  Tom, that's just like what happened in your life. 
[00:43:30]  That's exactly what happened in your life.  Oh!  Holy shit.  Tippi Tom goes down.  Wow.  Tippi goes down.  Get hurt on feelings, man.  You know what I'm saying?  I thought I was going to win.  You had a 20.  You pulled a miracle six for a 20.  I had 20 here.  Oh, that hurt.  Oh, Tom.  That's going to really hurt.  That had a fucking hurt.  Oh, boy.  It's going to work out better.  Oh, Tom.  You know, you broke my heart. 
[00:44:00]  You should have stayed with the 40 bucks.  You had 40 bucks.  Why'd you bet it?  And now it's gone.  Now you got no beers and no money.  No beer.  No fucking money.  No nothing.  No nothing.  You had all those beers and 40 bucks.  You could have had a fucking party tonight.  That's right.  Could have gotten a hooker.  Yeah!  All right, Tom.  We're done with you.  Scram.  We got a radio show.  Yeah, we don't need losers.  We don't hang out with losers.  All right.  I lost. 
[00:44:30]  Maybe there's a video clip we could watch.  You know, a Meryl Streep film perhaps.  All right.  I'm a loser.  Oh, my God.  That couldn't work out better.  So I lost.  Yeah.  Oh, Tom.  Damn, that sucks.  You lost it all.  $140 and six beers.  Yeah.  Tippi Tom's very unhappy.  Tippi Tom's unhappy.  How do you feel?  I don't feel very good.  Tippi Tom don't feel good.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I lost all that money. 
[00:45:00]  Damn, you had so much money.  And I won all that money.  Fuckin' Danny.  Why?  I don't know why.  Just for the hell of it.  Fuckin' Danny's a dirty dealer.  Please the fucker.  Fuckin'.  Oh, no.  Let's him get a 20, too.  Oh, no.  He doesn't even give him like a 19.  Play with me.  He gets him a 20.  You know what the weird thing is?  I gained $10 on that whole thing.  How did that happen?  Oh, it's yours, then?  All right.  There's your 10.  Timmy Tom wants a play with me. 
[00:45:30]  Fuckin' Danny's a dirty dealer.  No more gamblers left?  Danny lets him get a 20.  Fuckin' no.  Not only did he get a play in black,  he gave him a 20.  I saw the A's.  I go, oh, my God.  I pledged like Danny.  He goes, I know.  It would have been funner if he won.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Something's wrong with you gambling.  Something's wrong with our gambling.  Why, Tom?  Because I...  Are you calling us cheaters? 
[00:46:00]  I think someone's cheating.  This is a legit joint.  Cheaters?  Why, I...  I think a dealer had a problem with this.  Really?  Yeah.  You can't say bad things about...  He slipped me the booby card.  I lived in Reno, Nevada for years.  Yeah, you do.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm not a joke.  You thought you...  And no.  You saw me...  You caught a hanger? 
[00:46:30]  Caught a hanger?  Well, listen.  We're going to take a break, Tom.  That's how the cookie crumbles.  All right.  What can I tell you, you know?  We'll take a break.  It happens.  And, uh...  Well, I didn't...  Tom, I poured all the beers out into the bucket.  Maybe you could just drink out of the bucket, Tom.  Why not?  Why not, man?  Why not, right?  A spackle bucket.  We were pouring the beers into a spackle bucket.  There might be some liquid at the bottom of that thing.  I want to win the money.  Well, maybe we'll think of something else for you. 
[00:47:00]  All right?  But for now, we take our money back.  I'm going home, back to the place where I belong.  And where your love has always been enough for me.  I'm not running from...  No, I think you got me all wrong.  I don't know, regret this life I choose for me. 
[00:47:30]  But these places and these faces are getting old.  So I'm going home.  So I'm going home.  Well, I'm going home.  Take a few minutes to fumigate the room.  We'll be right back with Tippi Tom.  The man, the stench, the legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197, XM 202. 
[00:48:00]  And now, a messy moment in Tippi Tom history.  Hey, this is Keith the Cop.  And reflecting back on some of my time with Tippi Tom,  I had found Tippi Tom for an appearance on the show one day.  And I was running a little late.  I had my wife's leased vehicle, Cherokee.  And I didn't have time to really put Tippi Tom on the subway.  So the leased vehicle was going back the next day.  And Tippi Tom smelled pretty rank that day. 
[00:48:30]  But I decided that I would flip up the hatch  and load Tippi Tom into the back of the Cherokee  and drive him up to the studio.  And I did, with all the windows rolled down.  And the next day when I had to turn the vehicle in  and the guy was walking around the vehicle checking it out,  he did mention to me,  what is that smell?  And I just kind of looked at him and said,  dude, I have no idea what you're talking about. 
[00:49:00]  Tippi Tom ruined the interior of my wife's car.  Tippi Tom.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Continues only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the man, the stench, the legend.  A tribute to Tippi Tom here on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Celebrating the life and unfortunate demise  of our homeless friend Tippi Tom  and going over some of our favorite Tippi Tom moments  on The Opie and Anthony Show.  And Danny, well, I'm primetime Sam Roberts  along with Eric and Danny from The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:49:30]  And Danny, I couldn't be more happy that you're here  because we're highlighting Homeless Pyramid.  Well, I always say this to people when talking about Tippi Tom,  and I think they think I'm joking or I'm kidding.  I say that Tippi was one of my favorite people.  And I think they think I mean like on the show or, you know.  No, he was one of my favorite people of all time.  He was hysterically funny.  He was always in a good mood.  And, you know, I love the guy to death.  And I wanted to do something and bring Tippi and bring him into this. 
[00:50:00]  And so we did a little game called Homeless Pyramid.  It wasn't all homeless people,  but it was kind of like $25,000 pyramid,  and you get some of the wackos that hang out with us.  And I think we threw Tippi in.  And who's the other guy?  Papa Rock.  Papa Rock, that's right.  And, you know, we tried to get them to play, well, $25,000 pyramid.  Yeah, the idea is that they have clues  and they have to get their partner to guess it.  But, I mean, you know, of course they're all drunks  and every one of them is deranged in some way, shape, or form. 
[00:50:30]  You're talking about Stalker Patty and Big A.  Well, I could tell you who's in it,  but you could just listen for yourself.  It's Homeless Pyramid Part 1 on a tribute to Tippi Tom,  the man, the stench, the legend.  Tippi Tom, the man, the stench, the legend.  By the way, I don't like all these surgical masks in studio.  Anthony is Anthony, but no one else.  I'm tired of it.  It's such a stench.  Where's the E-Rock?  No mask.  Stop it.  I'm not wearing a mask.  Stop it.  I'm not wearing a mask. 
[00:51:00]  It clears the sinuses, man.  Yeah, it sure does.  All right, well, yeah, Francine, take the mask off.  Yeah, that's the beauty of this.  What's with the mask?  Stop it.  We got to paint the picture for everybody.  We got a long table over there, way over there.  We got Big A sitting across from Sandy Kane.  We got Twitchell sitting across from Tippi Tom.  And we got Papa Rock sitting across from Francine.  And we're going to do something called the, what, $10,000 Homeless Pyramid.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  That's right. 
[00:51:30]  It's going to be a homeless pyramid.  Right, right.  We're going to be playing.  And I guess the rules are very similar to the game that you're all so familiar with.  Right, right.  At home, the $25,000 pyramid hosted by Nick Muck.  Right.  But only done with homeless people and the rest of the dregs of society we've had on our program.  Why is Big A sitting on the homeless side?  First observation. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, you were homeless, Sandy Kane?  No, I was in a women's shelter.  Were you?  Oh, yeah.  Right after I did your show, a battered women's shelter.  I was in a women's shelter.  You had to smell all that stuff.  You had to smell all that stuff.  After their abuse.  All right, well.  Was it women that were battered or guys that wanted to batter women could go there and just punch you in the face?  It was a safe house for guys that like to beat women.  Yeah, a safe house.  She's not going to care.  You want to be able to beat up your woman in a safe environment.  It's very important.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, my God.  They're just babbling.  This is, yeah.  Who do you think is going to win this?  I want these masks.  Are there odds on anybody?  Well, I got a few bucks.  Let me smell.  Yeah, we want to smell.  We cannot have all these masks.  I don't like it.  Okay.  Everyone get your, look, I took it off.  Get your goddamn mask off.  If Iraq has a mask on us, slap it off his face.  If you're just tuning in, something's coming off Tippy Tom that is knocking everybody back.  We've smelled Tippy Tom for years, but the smell he brought us today is amazing. 
[00:53:00]  So bad.  Yeah, so.  I didn't use my summer's Eve.  That's what it is.  It's winter, you know.  All right.  All right, Thana, are we ready to attempt this?  Take your shoes off, at least.  Let Tom take his shoes off while they're playing.  Tom, take your shoes off.  Get comfortable.  Tom, take your shoes off, Tom.  And Papa is working his belt buckle.  It's just a mess over there.  And Francine is miserable.  Somebody tell Tom to take his shoes off.  We'll give him $5.  All right.  Hey, Thana, what do we got going on?  I think one of them is off. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, it's just his foot looks like a shoe.  Oh, that's what it is.  You're right.  It's just gangrenous.  It really looks the same on or off, that foot.  Wow.  Oh, give me a $5.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Your foot looks like a fin.  Yeah, something like that.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy just got a couple of $5 bills.  Sure.  Nice.  What's that doing at?  You take each shoe off, and you get a $5 for each shoe.  I'm going to take off. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  I'll give you $20.  I'll give you $20 if you leave them on.  This show stinks.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Shoes are off.  Shoes are off.  Whoa.  Make a few dollars.  All right.  When we get on, Scott.  You got to leave them off, though.  There you go.  $10.  I'm leaving them off.  I'm starting to feel better about myself.  Now, everybody.  Thank you.  Tom, we got another $100 for you.  I told you what was going to happen.  Now, you got to pay me off, too, to put them back on.  Kick your feet up.  All right. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Kick your feet up.  Get comfortable, Tom.  Get comfortable.  Get comfortable.  There you go.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, his feet are up on the table.  Oh, my God.  The catastrophe.  I'm the best-looking guy with the best-looking feet in the whole building.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Attaboy, Tom.  Yeah.  I'm so goddamn good-looking, and my feet are perfect.  You could be a foot model.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn right.  Yeah.  Now, I'm going to get some Dr. Stolls next week. 
[00:55:00]  Swollen.  Swollen, man.  Now that I can buy them.  What are those pimples doing?  All right.  It looks like Jamie Lynn Spears' unborn child.  This is called walking around New York too long.  And, see, nobody walks around here.  That's right, Tom.  I walk uptown, downtown, all around town.  Tom, Tom.  Your feet walk side, west side, all around side town.  Jesus Christ.  He'll never shut up.  No way.  All right.  All right.  All right.  What is that?  Your feet look like you've been driving the Flintstones car in heavy traffic. 
[00:55:30]  No more.  All right, Dan.  Let's try this game.  I know we're not going to get far in the game, but Danny is here to explain what's going  to happen, Anthony.  Danny, go ahead.  I'm turning their mics off for a while.  Oh, back to the music.  Yes.  Well, basically, if everybody remembers the old $25,000 pyramid and the way that worked,  it's going to be very, very similar, just like the final round.  Do we have something going on over there?  Of course we do.  Go ahead, Danny.  Continue.  So there'll be a topic.  One person's going to have a topic. 
[00:56:00]  The other person has to try to guess what that topic is without saying the key words  of said topic.  Sure.  Just like the game.  You know how it's played.  All right.  You give the clues and the guy has to come up with the word, but you can't use the word  in the clues or else, you know, you get this or something like that.  By the way, Barry from Pittsburgh, he's a regular on his feedback.  He writes, how about a new bit?  Are Tom's feet alive?  Don't put your feet back in the shoes.  Tom, kick your feet back.  You're the star of the show. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, Tom.  You get comfortable.  Don't worry about these guys.  Don't be shy.  All right.  Let's go, then.  Who's up first?  Big A and Big A?  Popper Hawk's just completely disinterested.  He's turned his chair around.  He's looking out the window.  Oh, he's just being dramatic.  He's protesting.  Right.  This idea of protest.  We get it.  All right, guys.  Let's get this game.  What's the matter?  All the contests at the table.  It looked like the little wind.  They're not happy.  Francine looks like she's going to puke.  All right, Big A and Sandy Cain.  Who's giving the clues there, Stan? 
[00:57:00]  Are you talking to Tippy Tom?  Big A should give the...  No, no.  Are you talking to Tippy Tom?  So let's got to move these guys back when they're not...  There you go.  Just stay right there, Tom.  Thank you.  All right, Big A should give the clues to Stan Cain.  I think Tippy Tom's feet should get their own microphone.  Go ahead, Big A.  Somebody better than me?  Is that you, the Freelander?  Yeah, what's up, baby?  How are you doing?  Good to see you, girl.  This is like a mental hospital.  I remember you from New York.  I remember Sandy Cain from New York Comedy Club.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  In the bathroom.  No one cares.  All right, here we go.  In the bathroom.  Yeah, we get it.  Another sex joke.  Jesus.  All right, Big A, go ahead.  Big A has to give the clues.  Sandy Cain's got to figure out what the word is.  Listen, Sandy Cain.  Shut up.  Is that you, Judah?  No.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Here we go.  Okay.  Wait.  Wait.  What is the word?  Well.  How do you play?  Okay.  Things below the waist. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, I got one.  Things below the waist.  All right.  All right.  She's going to try to guess what you mean.  We can't give out clues.  They're doing it all right.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  Our job is to just make fun of the less fortunate.  Things below the waist.  I have a good one, Matt.  Okay.  All right.  Kneecaps.  Ankles.  Things on time that are running.  No.  You can't jump in.  Oh, sorry.  It might have well been the answer, too. 
[00:58:30]  Ankles.  Kneecaps.  Feet.  Thighs.  Tired.  Kneecaps.  Legs.  Legs.  Legs.  Legs.  At least they're below the waist.  Can I say?  I don't know.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  What can I say?  I think it's something a little bit more risque.  That's in the middle of my thighs.  That.  Does it begin with a V? 
[00:59:00]  No.  No.  The V word.  Okay.  What are you talking to describe?  Oh.  Yeah.  The answer was things below the waist.  Oh.  Jesus.  No points for that team.  Oh, this is going to take forever.  Tippi Tom.  Incredibly stupid.  Let's try to squeeze one more in before the break.  It's Tippi Tom and Twitchels.  Luke.  Tom will be giving the clues.  All right.  Tom will be giving the clues. 
[00:59:30]  Does he know what he's...  He's writing it down right now.  Writing it down.  All right.  But we have to whisper it to everybody out there.  Let's distract them for a second.  Let's see.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  It stinks so bad.  Come on now, guys.  There's Lysol going off over there.  My sign is spraying something.  I don't even know what it is.  It's citrus.  I hold up the thing for Tom.  This is what he's going to try to describe.  Now, Tom, you don't have to read what's on the paper, right?  I never read the paper.  Don't read what's on the paper.  He goes, I never read the paper. 
[01:00:00]  Tom, you got to...  You have to describe those things.  No, don't say it.  Did he say it?  I knew he was going to do that.  Did he say it?  Tom, you're trying to get him to say that.  Describe the thing.  Describe the thing.  Did you ever watch the $25,000 pyramid?  Of course.  Well, you know how it works?  Of course.  You sit there.  You give clues to try to get Twitchels to say that line that's written on that piece of paper.  Don't say it.  Okay.  I'll say office.  An office. 
[01:00:30]  Danny, what's the word?  Give me something else.  Office.  What?  Okay.  You've used the word that's in the phrase.  Oh, my God.  All right.  He said office.  All right.  The phrase was things in a doctor's office.  And your first clue was an office.  No, you didn't.  All right.  You're out.  You said orifice.  He was trying to say orifice.  You gave it away.  A good clue would have been.  I gave it a big clue.  You should have said stethoscope.  You should have said an office.  You should have said an office.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  One more.  We can squeeze one more in before the break because that went so fast.  Insurance for you.  I'm not sure.  All right.  Yeah.  Papa Rock is going to have a scene say what's on the paper.  All right.  We're writing down the clue.  All right.  We're writing down the clue.  And you're going to have 30 seconds.  We finally, I got the bed in front of me here.  Oh, good.  Okay.  We'll have 30 seconds.  All right.  So you got 30 seconds, Papa Rock, to make Francine say what's on the paper.  Okay?  He's thinking.  All right.  What is it? 
[01:01:30]  Whisper it to everybody, Jimmy, out there in radio.  Things on a plane.  You didn't hear that, did you, Francine?  Things on a plane.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's Papa Rock.  Go.  Stewardess.  What?  Airplane.  Things on a plane.  Oh, wait a minute.  But it wasn't you.  He's giving the clues. 
[01:02:00]  He's talking right to Papa Rock.  He's giving the clues.  I'll give you the clues.  Francine gets closed by saying a plane, not things on a plane.  She goes, a plane.  And then Papa Rock goes, things on a plane, like he won.  But he's the guy giving the clues.  He's not even part of that team.  Good one.  Things on a plane.  Oh, Jesus.  What did you do?  You're not just.  What did you do?  Put on a plane. 
[01:02:30]  If you hold your arms out like this.  Oh, don't do that.  Oh, boy.  Don't lift your arms up, Tom.  For the love of God, don't.  Oh, wings.  This one's on a plane.  Atta boy, Tom.  Good point.  All right.  It's like a bird.  It's a close match.  Yeah, it's a close match.  It's zero to zero to zero.  Judah Freelander from 30 Rock.  You going to be at Caroline's?  Is that?  Yeah, yeah.  Today's Thursday, right?  Tonight through.  Thursday to Sunday, yeah.  Nice.  Judah Freelander from 30 Rock hanging with us.  We'll talk to him, and we'll get the other half of this dumb game going after the break. 
[01:03:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Tom.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Yes, he did.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  That was so funny.  I know, guys.  Oh, boy.  But, Danny, just when you thought that was too much here on the man, the stench, the legend,  a tribute to Tivy Tom, there's more, yes, more.  More?  More.  Homeless Pyramid.  Eric?  Yes, I also want to point out Judah Freelander is in studio for this bit, and Judah's done 
[01:03:30]  some crazy shit, and even he can't fully understand the madness that is Tivy Tom.  Yeah, Judah Freelander might look somewhat homeless, but keep in mind, he's on one of  the biggest sitcoms on television right now.  He's a big star.  So, we entertain him with Homeless Pyramid.  Listen to the rest of it.  It's just, it's golden.  It's the man, the stench, the legend, a tribute to Tivy Tom.  Tivy Tom.  The man, the stench, the legend.  All right, we're going back to the, I don't know why we're calling it the $10,000 Homeless 
[01:04:00]  Pyramid when it was called $25,000 Pyramid.  I don't know.  We had to tie it into something.  Sure.  It's kind of those rules.  Sure.  One party gives the other party little clues to a phrase without using any of the words  in the phrase.  It seems to be a big problem with these people.  Yeah.  And the other person has to guess what they're talking about.  And we got Big A and Sandy Cain matched up.  We got Tivy Tom and Twitchels matched up. 
[01:04:30]  And we got Papa Rock and Francine matched up.  The score, zero to zero to zero.  Zero, zero, zero.  Someone is saying this is worse than SNL's Celebrity Jeopardy! bit.  Yeah.  Just horrid.  All right, let's try this again.  So, it's Big A and Sandy Cain.  The clue is words, words that start with S-T.  Words that start with S.  S-T.  That's Big A and...  Okay, here we go.  Big A and Sandy Cain. 
[01:05:00]  Who's going first?  It's not your turn yet.  Okay, so I can start now?  Yeah.  Start.  Stop.  Stampede.  Stutter.  Standard.  Stump.  Um, things I, um, things I, um, things I do.  Um.  Stampede.  Starry. 
[01:05:30]  Starry.  This is great.  Star.  Um.  Stick.  Star.  Uh.  Stampede.  Stop.  Stutter.  Star.  That's stupid.  Stump.  Uh.  Answer, Big A.  Strap.  Uh.  Strap.  Strap.  Uh.  Oh, boy.  Uh.  The answer?  Good suggestions, though.  Yeah.  I mean, Sandy did her job.  You did your job, Sandy.  Yes. 
[01:06:00]  Sandy did good.  Uh.  Big A.  You're a blithering idiot.  How did you not get that?  Words that start with S-T.  Right.  I got it.  Your favorite.  Pop Rock's like, right.  I got that.  Yeah.  All right.  Twitchels and his partner.  Tom.  Dan, can I see the clue?  What?  What's happening?  Focus.  Focus.  We're getting over a what?  He's getting over a what?  Grab that thing off the floor.  Uh.  Grab it.  Dude, you got to get it off the floor.  It's going to catch fire. 
[01:06:30]  It's my cigarette.  Okay.  Why don't you want to pick it up?  Because I don't want to go near the state.  Always the word, Dan.  All right.  Twitchels will be giving out the clues.  Tippi Tom will try to guess.  Okay.  You got to guess now, Tippi.  Okay.  You ready?  Wait, wait, wait.  Things that jump.  Okay.  Things that jump.  Tom.  Yes, sir.  All right.  Kangaroos.  Uh.  Me.  Well, you're a good looking man.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  But you don't look as good as a kangaroo. 
[01:07:00]  I'm not going to skip.  I'm going to.  I'm not going to skip.  But I'm going to.  You're going to do what?  Do what a kangaroo?  What does a kangaroo do?  They jump.  Okay.  You're not paying attention to the rules.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Say pouch.  Hey, nitwit.  Hey, idiot.  You're supposed to just give words.  You can't say.  No.  No.  No.  You're not describing the thing.  You're just.  You're supposed to give words.  Give another.  He brought up the kangaroo subject.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  So I'm going to ask questions on this. 
[01:07:30]  Kangaroo.  He started saying how good looking I am.  It doesn't matter.  A kangaroo, you can stay.  And then you've got to continue doing clues like that.  Okay.  My God.  All right.  Well.  Anyway.  Do you still even get it?  I'm trying to get it.  You still can guess it.  I'm slow.  Are we going with a new one?  You want to do a different one?  Yeah.  Do a different one with these two morons.  We'll do another one, Tom.  All right.  Okay.  Please.  All right.  All right.  All right.  What is it that you want to hear?  Please.  You sleep.  Okay.  Here we go.  And go to the right. 
[01:08:00]  Interesting one.  Go.  You want me to sing a song?  I'll do a little Frank Sinatra for you.  That's not going to work.  Under a bridge.  Or a bridge.  Street.  A rap song.  Curb.  Curb.  Curb.  Subway.  Penn Station.  Don't get under the subway, baby.  No, no.  No, that's not it, Tom.  Don't go on the subway, baby.  Close. 
[01:08:30]  I live on the subway.  What are you out of your mind?  Stop with this.  You live on the subway.  Of course.  It's my home.  Singing in the middle of this game.  Tom, the answer was places you sleep.  Right.  Places you sleep, you were supposed to say from the clues that Twitchells was giving.  You should have thought places to sleep.  All right.  He didn't say places he lives.  Well, places to sleep.  Yeah, like the subway's a good place.  Yeah, that's what he was saying. 
[01:09:00]  What's the best place to sleep on the subway?  And people come up and give you food.  But you didn't say it, so I'm sorry.  The score is still zero, zero, zero if I'm keeping telling here.  Hey, Tom, what's the best place, what's the best train to sleep on?  It'll cost me two bucks to get on the subway, and I'm good.  What train's the best to sleep on?  I can't hear you.  What's the best train to sleep on?  Actually, there's so many of them.  Most of all of them. 
[01:09:30]  I!  Take your shoes off.  You can have any train you want.  Well, the longest ride, which is the E-Train, which is one I like.  All right.  We get back to that game.  We're running out of time here.  Yeah.  All right.  Now we got, what, Paparock and Francine.  Paparock and Francine.  And Jimmy will give the clue.  Let's be very polite about this.  Things at a library, things at a library.  Okay, Francine will describe words, and Paparock, you will have to guess what Francine is trying 
[01:10:00]  to...  Are you talking about Paparotti?  Who's talking about Paparotti?  No, no, no.  You're not playing in this part of the game.  I like Paparotti.  No, no, Paparock.  Okay, and Francine, you will be describing giving clues.  And go.  Where's the music?  Oh.  Cars, reading, books, lots of books. 
[01:10:30]  Things at a library.  Yes.  He got it.  Yes.  Yes, but...  We got a point.  Well, maybe not.  I don't think...  What's the ruling on...  You got to give him the point.  The man sleeps outdoors.  No, no.  It's actually Francine's giving of the clues was not good.  I know, but...  But my clues aren't good?  No.  Well, you won't clue where he said lots of books.  That's not...  It has to just be books.  You just got to go books.  Yeah.  That's true.  That was a...  I say you give it to him.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Absolutely not.  We will not make a travesty of this game that is the $25,000 pyramid. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  You know, Anthony, I did bring you Lucky Strike cigarettes.  For what reason?  I have no idea, because there's Spanish writing on the outside.  And she found them on the floor at a Christmas party.  And thought they weren't available anywhere.  She thought she found some unique thing.  All right.  Get your tippy-tom shoes.  I think I deserve that point.  Yeah, we'll get it.  All right.  So after the second round, it's still zero to zero to zero.  Let's go into it one more round, and then the grand finale here.  We got something planned.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:11:30]  It's back to Big A and Sandy Kane.  Who's giving the clues this time around?  Big A.  Big A's giving the clues.  Sandy Kane's got to guess what Big A is describing.  He's wheezing into the mic.  That's a paparazzi.  That's a paparazzi.  Oh, okay.  He's being put.  All right.  Do we have the clue that we can tell everyone out there in Radio Line?  All right.  It's time for somebody to talk.  Okay.  The clue to push?  What?  Yes.  Something.  You push.  All right.  Something.  Silence is golden.  All right.  Nice.  All right.  Go ahead.  And the music. 
[01:12:00]  What's that?  All right.  Big A, go ahead.  A door.  House.  Shopping cart.  Supermarket.  Places you buy food.  Shopping cart.  Open doors.  Doors. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Goddamn, that was great.  A door and a shopping cart.  And a shopping cart was all you could think.  Things you push.  How about a stool?  You push a stool.  How about your luck with the Grim Reaper?  Things you push.  Wow.  I'll be honest.  I couldn't think of anything else either.  Really?  You know, I thought I did pretty well.  You should be playing in the game.  I don't think of you.  Still zero, zero, zero. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  We're back to Twitchels and Tippi Tom.  Tough game.  It is.  All right.  Things in the air.  All right.  Who's going to be describing?  Tom.  Tom, you guys describe.  Tippi Tom is going to be describing.  Explain to him.  Tippi Tom, you will describe words.  You will say words to describe what is being held up.  The sign that's being held up.  Okay.  So you say it would be a sign held up.  And then you must just use one word at a time until Twitchels understands what you are trying to convey to him. 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  But just use one word.  All right.  Here we go.  At a time.  Here we go.  That is a good idea.  Don't say anything.  And don't read any words that are on that paper.  Not one word that's on that paper you're not allowed to say.  I hope you just got to.  Oh, so I got to read between the lines or something?  Yeah.  Well, read the paper to yourself so you know what you got to try to get it.  You got to get him to say what's on that paper without saying what's on that paper.  You just got to use other words.  It's going to say something on the paper. 
[01:14:00]  You got to.  All right.  Don't read the whole paper.  Don't read anything on the paper.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Just go.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  And I'm ready to roll.  Two times.  Okay.  I don't know what's going on.  And what it says there, I really don't know why I'm even here.  But I think it says.  No, don't read it.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Just describe certain things that have to do with what's on that paper. 
[01:14:30]  Like, I'll give you.  What, describe the guy that's holding the paper?  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not quite evolved yet.  I'll give you.  But what can I say?  Tom, I'll give you one hint.  You would look at that, and then you would tell Twitchells, you'd go, a bird.  Oh, you want to go like that way?  Yeah.  And then you name a bunch of other things that also have to do with what's written on that paper.  All right?  Until Twitchells says what's on that paper.  Oh, so describe a word. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You got to describe things.  Facsimilar.  Okay.  All right, here we go.  Let's try it again.  And go.  Okay.  Air.  I need some fresh air.  No.  No, no, you.  Eyes of air.  Oxygen.  You said air.  Things that fly.  No, he blew it.  Idiots actually trying to play the game.  Hey, hey, jackass.  He said something that was in the clue.  Oh, wait.  It's things in the air.  And he said air.  Well, asses exist. 
[01:15:30]  Dude, it is.  There's no.  Somebody got me an ass.  Norton, he's so miserable.  There's no telling him.  Norton's got an observation.  I'm more annoyed at stupid Twitchels actually trying to play the game.  Wait, hold on now.  Things in the sky?  Yeah.  All right.  The final team is Papa Rock.  This is for the win, by the way.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm confused.  What's the score, Opie?  Zero to zero to zero.  Okay.  Zero to zero to zero. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  This is the last one because we're running out of time here.  All right.  Here we go.  Papa Rock's going to describe what's on the paper and Francie's going to try to guess.  Here we go.  Do we get this, they win?  Is that right?  Hey, do we know what the answer is in Radioland?  Let's look.  All right.  State capitals.  All right.  Here we go.  State capitals.  Now, this is for the people that linger longer by.  All right.  Very good writing today.  I think he's after you.  Here we go.  Albany. 
[01:16:30]  State.  Austin.  Once again, pretty good clue. 
[01:17:00]  We're going to give you our date.  Albany.  He's the best.  He's the greatest find ever.  Oh, man.  Tippi Tom.  Well, sorry.  The answer was state capitals.  And we're going to have to have everyone back to continue the game because we ran out of time.  We ran out of time.  We're so sorry.  Zero to zero to zero.  We'll have to pick up where we left off after the holiday. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  I lived in Albany.  What?  What?  What?  What, Tom?  I'm from New Jersey, but I live in Albany, too.  Hey, Tom.  I got a...  I got a...  We're running out of show.  If you could do this before we get off the air, I will hand this over to you.  I'm holding $100 in fives.  Am I going to get up?  You get up?  I can get up?  You strip down your underpants?  Is it a real one?  Yes, it's real, Tom.  It's real.  You strip down your underpants before we get off the air, which is a mere two minutes from 
[01:18:00]  right now.  The pole.  The pole.  No, no, no.  Get there.  Get there.  Get there.  Get there.  Get there.  Get there.  Get there.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  No one leave.  Hey.  Hey.  Close that door.  Clear that pole.  Mike, Tom.  Two barrels of $100.  $100.  Down your underpants.  Oh, God.  I think you're lying to me.  Yeah, I got up for nothing.  Show him the money.  Tom.  Tom, can you still show him the money?  No, no, no, no.  No, no.  Whoa, whoa.  Take your clothes off for $100.  For $100.  $100.  Tom, quickly.  We're running out of show.  Running out of show. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  Quick, quick, quick, quick.  Okay, come on.  What are you talking about?  No, you're kidding.  No, you can't see my ugly legs.  $100.  I'm showing golden buns.  My name is Golden Buns, by the way.  Unlike you, I am the real golden buns.  Tom, shoes off.  I got the nicest ass in the world.  $100.  Take off your pants for $100.  $100.  How am I going to back on?  We'll help you. 
[01:19:00]  $100.  We'll buy you new pants.  See, Sam's sick.  Whoa.  Well, how am I going to take them off?  With two hands.  Yeah, but I'm dropping down on my knees.  $100.  All the way off.  All the way off.  $100.  I don't believe this is going to work.  I'm not sure if I trust you.  By the way, Chris Rock in studio tomorrow.  You want me to take your pants off? 
[01:19:30]  Take the pants off.  Don't sit on.  No, no, no, no.  Let me get you on the chair.  And the replay.  Oh, Pat, come on.  The replay of Ant and I on Leno tonight.  Sit down.  Musical guest of Killers.  Yeah.  Check it out.  All right.  Oh, well, we got to throw that chair away.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  I'm glad I have the best of you.  Don't look at my legs.  All right.  All the way down.  All the way down.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get off.  It's going to be hard to get them off.  Wow.  His legs are really big.  Tom, we got to get some medical attention.  All right.  Now, Tony, take my shoes off. 
[01:20:00]  Somebody take my shoes off.  Hold on.  No one is volunteering.  All right.  Come on.  His pants got to come off.  I'm making a hundred bucks here.  Oh, get that goddamn thing away from me.  Get that away from me.  This shoe went flying.  It's that way.  I'm trying to get my pants off, goddammit.  I don't think you can get them off.  I don't think you can get them off.  Your legs are really big.  I think it's as far as you can get them.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  Jesus.  For a hundred bucks.  All right.  Anytime. 
[01:20:30]  Anytime.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to vomit.  Yeah, if I get a hundred bucks, watch, I'm probably getting cheated.  You ain't getting cheated.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  Tom's pants are a bit.  Those are not brand new pants.  Yeah.  Now stand up.  Thank you.  And there you go.  Tippy Tom.  With no pants on.  Tom, your legs are a little chubby.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there's snow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Turn around.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It's going down. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Show them your butts.  Show them your butts.  No, that's all right.  We saw everything we need to see.  I'm impressed.  This is how we end today.  The Opie and Anthony Institute of Art and Literature is proud to present a collection of  books on tape soulfully voiced by the homeless, Tippy Tom.  I can't do as good as a guy to do it with an album.  Masterpieces like Herman Melville's Moby Dick.  And Dickens historically themed A Tale of Two Cities. 
[01:21:30]  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  It was the age of wisdom.  Good job.  Okay.  You won't believe your ears as Tom mutters and fumbles his way through Mark Twain's classic  Huck Finn.  Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was under the window of Douglas's protection. 
[01:22:00]  Okay.  I guess I'm getting around.  And then be prepared to have your breath taken away.  Literally.  With his read of Great Expectations.  Heaven knows we'd never be ashamed of our tears.  Okay.  Of course not. 
[01:22:30]  Anyway, I think I got sort of a thing.  And finally, you'll enjoy the classic for all ages, Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham.  Great eggs and ham.  No, green eggs and ham.  See, I'm right.  See, one of my pleasant.  I am Sam.  I am Sam.  Sam, I am.  Come on, man.  I got my damn glasses on.  Who even knew Tippy Tom had glasses?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's a collection of some of the finest literature ever written and then read by a homeless drunk. 
[01:23:00]  Order Tippy Tom Books on Tape today.  We'll return with more of Tippy Tom.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[01:23:30]  And an emotional moment came to the Opie and Anthony show when we found out that homeless  friend of the show and possibly the greatest character to ever be broadcast on radio, Tippy  Tom, passed away.  While the ONA show grieved over this loss, we went to them to remember some of their favorite  Tippy Tom moments.  Steve, you've been with the show for a long time.  What is your favorite Tippy Tom memory?  Would have to be one of the first homeless shopping sprees.  He was the standout individual. 
[01:24:00]  I believe that was the first time he went to the Shorthills Mall and he just commanded  an audience everywhere he went.  He insisted on there being a crowd everywhere he went.  And the crowd just kind of followed him wherever he went.  He had the largest of any of the homeless guys with him to any place in that mall.  Keith DeComp, you probably knew Tippy Tom better than any of us.  What's your favorite Tippy Tom moment on the ONA show?  I have to say my favorite Tippy Tom moment was the day we first saw his balls. 
[01:24:30]  What was that like?  What was happening?  Tippy Tom wanted to dance on the stage because we had a couple girls in and they were doing  some gymnastics on the console and Tippy Tom got very irate that he didn't get to dance  on the stage as well.  So he proceeded to pull his pants down and we got the first look at Tippy Tom's balls.  And the golden buns.  And they are.  E-Rock, what is your favorite Tippy Tom memory? 
[01:25:00]  I think we were still doing the show at K-Rock and they had us all line up and show our asses  to Tom and he seemed rather fond of mine.  So I think that was...  Was it flattering?  It was very flattering.  He tried to touch me and then chase me.  There was something about Tippy Tom that if any other man had done it, it wouldn't have  been okay.  But because it was him...  Because it was him, it was totally acceptable.  You know, you let him get away with a whole bunch of different things.  Travis, we're all dealing with this loss. 
[01:25:30]  What is your favorite Tippy Tom memory from the ONA show?  Uh, I would have to say my favorite Tippy bit would be when Tippy Tom showed his emotional  side crying at Sophie's choice.  You never realize that it was just a YouTube clip with barely any audio.  It didn't matter though.  Tippy Tom took that movie so, so to heart.  Maybe, maybe because of his past.  Well, we don't really know, but, but you really saw Tippy as the person and not as, uh, and  not as the character. 
[01:26:00]  Danny, we're all coping with the loss of Tippy Tom.  Um, what is your favorite Tippy Tom show memory?  Well, that's tough because there've, there's been so many of them.  I think it's going to have to be when Dr. Steve gave Tippy his prostate exam.  I was, I just remember rolling, laughing all day.  There's been a lot of instances that come close.  Like I remember Tippy playing cards is really funny.  Uh, the first time I had actually met Tippy Tom, uh, when we all thought he was dead and 
[01:26:30]  then he fell asleep on the shitter, uh, back at the old XM studios, uh, all these things  are racing through my mind, but Tippy was on fire that day.  He was hysterical and he made me laugh like no other person could.  Well, the comic timing of this drunk homeless man would made you think that if he would just  get his stuff together a little bit, he could be like a huge celebrity.  I think if Tippy cleaned up, he would have been successful in whatever project he was  wanting to work on. 
[01:27:00]  What are you doing to cope with the loss?  I'll be doing a lot of drinking tonight for Tippy, for Tippy.  I've already cried enough.  There's no more tears.  Now it's time to put some liquid back into your body.  It's all for Tippy.  As a reporter, I have to take off my journalist hat to say that I am broken hearted over the  loss of Tippy Tom.  Never has a man with so little been so full of life.  Tippy Tom leaves a legacy that will never be surpassed and a gap that won't be repaired  anytime soon.  Goodbye, Tippy Tom.  The one and only Golden Buns. 
[01:27:30]  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  We hope you enjoyed the fresh air.  Now get back into the stinky with Tippy Tom, the man, the stench, the legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197, XM 202.  It's the man, the stench, the legend.  A tribute to Tippy Tom here on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Tippy Tom is no longer with us.  No, he passed away recently.  Our greatest homeless friend, one of our greatest friends of all time. 
[01:28:00]  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, that was Eric, and Danny is also here.  How did this happen?  Yeah, well, he died.  But Eric, this is, you said, I went around trying to find out what everybody's favorite  memory of Tippy Tom was, and this was yours.  Yeah, this was when we were doing the show on FM, and Opie decided to have the entire  staff and Norton line up and present their ass to Tippy Tom as he went and reviewed who  had the better ass.  Well, Tippy's an ass man. 
[01:28:30]  He's definitely an ass man.  He was always an ass man, and I remember, Danny, he liked yours.  You know, I thought I was going to win this one.  Yeah.  But you went early.  Yeah, I think Tippy had a bad habit of just favoriting whichever ass he had just seen.  Yes, that's true.  He liked mine, too.  I'm like, ooh, I like that one.  So I don't even know if we actually have a definitive winner in this particular contest,  but this is...  Eric insists it was him.  No, I don't insist it was me.  I just remember I was the first he tried to reach out and chase and grab.  Oh! 
[01:29:00]  Oh, that's nice.  I want me some ass.  One of the best parts of this bit is that he's not directly on mic, so he's a bit far  back in the studio.  Yeah.  But as each person presented, you hear him in the back go, oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Like, each one was better than the last one he saw.  Well, listen to it for yourself.  It's a Tippy Tom staff ass contest here on The Worst of Opie and Anthony presents Tippy  Tom, the man, the stench, the legend.  Tippy Tom, the man, the stench, the legend. 
[01:29:30]  I'm a nice man!  Yeah, I'm a nice man!  All right, let's get Tippy Tom in studio.  He's been waiting out there.  Open that door.  Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in a few months easily, it's Tippy Tom.  Tippy!  He's still talking to me, the poster version of me? 
[01:30:00]  All right, here he is.  Tippy!  What's up, Tippy?  There he is.  All right.  All right, Tippy Tom back in town.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Tippy, you were looking at our poster outside the studio.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  That doesn't sound good at all.  You all right, Tippy?  What's the matter?  I'm dying.  I'll be dead.  I'm out of this world. 
[01:30:30]  I want you to pray for me.  I'm dying.  I'll say, Tommy, we love you.  Why I go up in space.  Now, what I'm saying is this.  I'm dying.  I don't feel like dying right now.  Right.  Now, what I'm saying, I'm on Earth.  And I want to stay here for a little bit more time because I feel like being here.  So, but that cough sounds a little bad. 
[01:31:00]  Well, what sounds bad?  The cough.  You were just coughing pretty bad.  You were just coughing.  Ah, yeah.  I just coughed a little bit.  So what?  You never cough?  What are you telling me?  You don't cough anymore?  What?  You lost your cough?  Oh, shit.  That's great.  Just let him cough.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Oh, you want to hear a song?  Yeah, that's serious.  A little tune.  Okay, you want to hear a...  I bet it's going to be Rod Stewart.  No, no. 
[01:31:30]  You want Rod Stewart?  No.  Anything but Rod Stewart.  Any Barry Manilow?  You want some Barry Manilow?  All right.  I live with Barry Manilow.  No way.  Oh, yes.  So way.  Okay.  And this is what happened to him.  I can't go there right now.  Oh, come on.  Belt one out.  Yeah, belt one out for all time's sake.  I'm trying to belt one out right now.  Okay, I'm going to belt something tough.  Hey, if you want my body, and you think I'm sexy, come on, baby, let me know if you really 
[01:32:00]  want me.  Oh, I'm ready.  Come on, baby, let me know.  Oh, who sang that?  Rod Stewart.  Yep, you got it.  Why are you trying to turn around to high five and imagine another person?  I can't do it like Rod Stewart, but you know. 
[01:32:30]  What about Barry Manilow now?  You lived with Barry Manilow?  Briefly.  Now, this is when you were, you know, golden buns, I guess.  Back when I was golden buns.  Well, I still got my buns.  Well.  But the thing is, you know, they're sagging a little bit.  But I'm still golden buns.  I got the nicest ass in this whole studio.  And I'll tell you right now, I see everybody, no ass. 
[01:33:00]  Jimmy's got a nice ass.  No ass.  I see no ass.  I see no ass here.  Well, why don't we line up the boys and you can decide if any of them have a nice ass.  You see, like, nice ass.  Yeah, pull your ass down.  Come on, E-Rod, let's go.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  E-Rod, let's go.  Pat Duffy, let's go.  All right.  Club Soda Kelly, let's go.  I need some booty.  All right, let's line up the guys in front of Tippi Tom. 
[01:33:30]  Tippi, you decide who has a nice ass.  Terry, let's go.  Somebody.  Here comes Jimmy.  All right, Jimmy, we'll start.  Tippi's going to pick the best.  Yeah, everybody, line up.  Everyone's got to line up.  Hang a moon.  Hang a moon for Tippi Tom.  Hold on a minute.  And then Tom.  Hold on, let me set this up.  And then we need Tom to critique the asses.  We're filming this.  We got Jim Norton.  We got Club Soda Kenny.  We got Danny.  We got.  Why is the girl.  Yeah, girl, you don't have.  No, Travis, get in there.  Pat Duffy.  And E-Rock.  Jimmy, move over a little bit so we get everybody. 
[01:34:00]  I'll make a judgment.  I'll shoot up the nicest ass.  Should we do it one at a time or all?  All right.  Yeah, he should critique.  Move down a little bit so we can get E-Rock in front of Tippi Tom.  Yeah, one at a time.  He should critique each ass.  Yeah, all right.  Who wants to start?  E-Rock, go.  All right, E-Rock.  Now, Tippi Tom, what do you think?  Go ahead.  Rip.  All right, E-Rock, go ahead.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  That's some booty right there. 
[01:34:30]  E-Rock's got some booty right there.  Number one.  You like that, Tippi Tom?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, okay.  Is there anything wrong with his butt?  Not wrong with it at all.  Oh, look at that, E-Rock.  You got a thing.  Wow, E-Rock.  Hey, E-Rock.  All right.  No, no.  I don't see any more ass.  All right.  All right.  Here's Pat Duffy.  Oh, my God.  We got another one.  Oh, my goodness.  It's going to be a tough job for me. 
[01:35:00]  Damn, that booty.  Oh, my God.  What do you like about that one?  Hold me back.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what a nightmare.  What do you like about Pat Duffy's ass?  He's speechless.  All right.  He's speechless.  Look, he's so good.  There's nothing wrong with that ass at all.  No, huh?  Pat, congratulations.  You made Tippi Tom see God.  I feel really good about it.  Damn.  That's good.  All right, Travis.  All right, Travis.  Now, he has a different type of ass. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, he's really bummed that Pat Duffy pulled his pants back up.  All right, this is more of a twink ass.  Oh, a twinkie?  Oh, I want some of that.  Timmy Tom's coming up right behind Travis.  He wants some of that.  Oh, he does, yeah.  You like that?  Is that the best one so far?  It's a good one right now.  Oh, no.  All right, here comes Danny.  Come on.  I want some more ass. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, shit.  No.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my God, Danny.  I'm winning.  I am winning this one.  I think Danny's winning.  I'm winning this one.  These guys are very competitive, and I think.  All right, hold on.  Let me tell you what happened.  Yeah.  Danny showed Tippi Tom his butt there.  I'm golden buns, and I'll tell you right now.  If you're golden buns, I'm platinum buns.  Mine are better.  Wait, wait.  Let Tippi Tom finish.  What were you going to say?  I was going to say you got a nice ass. 
[01:36:30]  Danny worked it a little bit.  He, like, twitched his hip a little bit.  He kicked it out a little bit.  Look, even though I got to do to win.  These guys are very competitive.  Come on.  These guys are very competitive.  Let me see your ass.  Oh.  All right, so.  Oh, that's a real ass.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Tippi cannot stay away from man ass.  Did we explain when Danny pulled his pants down that Tippi started cursing?  He loved it so much.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:37:00]  He said to Kenny, that's a real ass.  Boy, he's got you pegged.  And last but not least, of course, is Jim Norton, who.  Yeah.  Tom.  Tom.  Tippi.  What do you think of a Jimmy's?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, she's no stay away.  Tippi, get on mic.  Get on mic.  We got to hear you.  No.  That's real ass.  That's the best ass I've.  You win.  Wow. 
[01:37:30]  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton edges out Danny for the best ass.  You know what?  According to Tippi Tom.  Hold on a minute.  No.  I think Jimmy broke the rules, though.  Jimmy did a few things that we can't explain here to make sure he won the competition.  Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, he pulled his pants down completely, first of all.  And then I believe, did you also do something so that maybe more was seen?  What do you mean?  I don't know.  Kind of use your hands a little bit.  So a little more.  Oh, no, no, no.  I actually didn't. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, you didn't?  Hold on.  But what he did do, it looked like he dropped something on the floor.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  All right.  That's what you did.  Hold on.  Does anyone, can I ask you a question?  Sure, sweetie.  Have you been massaging your buns?  No, they're very...  You go...  I think you've been...  You got implants?  He's asking if they're real. 
[01:38:30]  No, what I did was I dropped a trowel.  Oh, that's real?  Yeah.  And I sexually scuttled forward.  Yes, you did.  Yes, a little scuttle forward.  You're going to scuttle with your undies around here.  Are the guys going to let Jimmy take the title?  Does anyone else want a second shot at this?  I think...  What about Stan?  Stan's running out of it with his microphone holding.  Good job.  What about Steve?  Where's Steve at?  How about you guys?  I can't get out of here. 
[01:39:00]  I did tongue scraping.  I think I'm going to pass on this one.  You can show him your cheeks.  After yesterday?  Steve, are you going to show...  That smells worse than my leg.  All right, we got...  Steve, we're mooning Tippi.  All right, Tippi, here's another one.  Oh, no!  Good, I got out of here.  No, you're kidding.  All right, Tippi.  All right.  Here's another one.  What do you think?  All right.  My God!  Let me get a load of this.  No!  Get away from Steve!  No, he said, let me get a load of this. 
[01:39:30]  Right.  Now, I'm saying...  You see how slow Steve, like, got away?  Oh, please, stay away.  Oh, please.  Oh, no, help me.  Steve's a little shy.  And so he's a little shy about this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, I'm golden bones, and I'll tell you...  Oh, Roland!  Oh, Roland.  Roland will do it.  Come on, Roland.  Tippi, Tippi, do you like a hairier gentleman or a gentleman with not much hair?  I like both. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Roland is stepping up.  Let me see.  Here we go.  Here's our...  Oh!  Oh, Jesus.  No, no, get back.  Roland just ran away.  He just mooned and ran.  What do you think of that one there, Tippi Tom?  He gave me...  He gave me the moon?  Yeah.  Well, moon me some more.  I think he liked every single one.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  But Jimmy...  Oh, he got that.  Yeah, Jimmy won.  I have no problem with this.  And he got too close.  Jimmy won. 
[01:40:30]  Jimmy won.  Fair and square.  I had the little tight...  I've been elliptical machining.  I'm an ass man.  What are you...  Yes, you are.  Tippi Tom, the man, the stench, the legend.  I see it.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  This is the man, the stench, the legend.  A tribute to Tippi Tom on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Primetime Sam Roberts, E-Rock, and Danny are here presenting some of the most memorable 
[01:41:00]  moments of the late, great Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom was Danny's probably favorite person.  Yeah.  That's the whole reason Danny's here with us.  We've had a lot of guests in studio.  We've had a lot of celebrities and non-celebrities in studio and characters and out of everybody  that we've ever had, Tippi Tom has consistently been my all-time favorite guest.  And as much as Danny enjoyed being near Tippi Tom, Ant despised it.  Anthony enjoyed the radio that Tippi Tom brought, but just the stench and the germs that Tippi  Tom carried with him were not Anthony's cup of tea. 
[01:41:30]  So Anthony left the show early one day, and Tippi Tom was there, and Danny, what did we do?  Well, we kind of had Tippi emulate Anthony for the remainder of the show, and, you know,  Anthony's in charge of a lot of things that you have to touch.  Yeah.  You know, there's, you know, there's a sound effects machine, there's chairs with armrests.  Right.  If you're going to be Anthony, you've got to sit in his chair.  There's a wacky whistle and a horn.  You've got to put your mouth on things.  Well, I don't have to, but Tippi sure did. 
[01:42:00]  Yes, he enjoyed this, and we enjoyed him.  This is the man, the stench, the legend, the tribute to Tippi Tom on the worst of Opie and  Anthony.  I know that was horrible.  It really was bad.  Tippi Tom, the man, the stench, the legend.  We've got a huge crowd here at XM today.  The lovely Brie Olsen has joined the festivity.  She's sitting at the big table here.  We've got Dr. Steve at the table.  We've got Tippi Tom wandering around out there and bothering people.  Hold on. 
[01:42:30]  That mic's not on.  Why does the mic work sometimes, and then other times it doesn't?  Well, what is it that you're trying to say?  I was just saying hi to you, Tippi.  Oh, you're saying hello?  Yeah.  Well, hello to you, too.  All right.  I got an idea, Tippi.  How are you doing?  I got this idea.  It might be a little crazy.  I don't know.  But Anthony had to leave the show early today.  He's going down to the Bahamas.  He's doing the Fellini.  Oh, that's good news.  Why don't you come on in here, Tippi? 
[01:43:00]  Come on in, Tippi.  Come on in.  I want you to sit in Anthony's chair.  Tippi.  He's a man.  Tippi, I want you.  This is great news.  I want you to sit.  I want you to sit in Anthony's chair.  He has a big, comfy chair.  Make yourself comfortable, Tippi.  I feel like talking.  Let's hear it for Tippi Tom sitting in Anthony's chair.  Yeah.  There you go. 
[01:43:30]  You're right, Anthony.  It's the Tippi.  I'm all cleaned up just for you.  Tippi, it's the Opiate Tippi Tom Show.  Beautiful.  Here you go.  There's your mic.  Hey, Tippi, what can try out some of your quidness?  Hey, it's my new song.  Wait, play that whistle for everybody. 
[01:44:00]  Hold on, hold on.  I'm getting right.  There you go.  There you go.  Tippi Tom.  Sitting in Anthony's chair.  Why don't you try some of the other stuff out, Tippi?  You are a song.  What do you think?  What do you think of the horn there, Tippi?  I can play anything like you got.  Yeah.  I'm a musician. 
[01:44:30]  Why don't you try some of the buttons over there?  Just push some of the buttons over there.  What button do you want to put?  Whatever one you want.  It's you, Tom.  All right, one.  Don't you do it!  Is that enough?  No, keep going.  I got nowhere else to do it!  Five, two.  Hold on, hold on, Tom.  One at a time.  I'm trying to do it.  Put it off.  Two at a time.  I'm thinking, man.  Four.  Well, let me tell you something, my crud, McFriend. 
[01:45:00]  As far as I go, I'm up to ten.  I don't care how many Dago, Gennie, Wood, Priest, Paul, Kumbach, Carolina, no one word.  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  It's in the hole!  Oh, yeah!  It was my prize!  Hey, try the bell there, Tom.  Try the bell.  Hold on.  How come Tom doesn't have headphones on?  Oh, Tom, do you have headphones on?  He was having a spray. 
[01:45:30]  Tom should put those headphones on.  You don't need spray.  Put the headphones on.  I got to talk to somebody.  All right, why don't you put the headphones on?  There you go.  Oh, what's in here?  Yeah, try that.  Try blowing into that.  Yeah, that's funny.  There you go.  Oh, look, it's Anthony on line three.  Hey, wait, Tom.  Tom.  Take this next call through the bullhorn.  Hey, Tom.  I don't like the bullhorn.  Yeah, give him the bullhorn.  Here, try the bullhorn out there, Tom. 
[01:46:00]  Well, yeah.  Wait, over there.  Right there.  That's a goddamn good idea.  Right here.  I know that.  What I'm saying is this.  Push the button, Tom.  Here we go.  Yeah, guys, push it in and talk.  All right, now, what I'm saying is that  I like the bullhorn, and I don't see no bullhorns around here.  There's no buffalo over here either. 
[01:46:30]  You know, I'm tired of all this New York City.  Hey, Tom.  No buffalo.  Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.  What?  Focus, focus.  Grab the mic.  Put the bullhorn down.  Now, take the next call for us, okay?  All right, who's calling?  No, just go, hi, who's this?  Go ahead.  Say it.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, who's this?  Get that animal out of my house.  No. 
[01:47:00]  The animal's not here now.  I will not.  I will never use any of those things again.  I want everything disinfected.  The entire side of the studio.  And I will not sit in that chair.  You're fired.  You're out of business now, buddy.  You're fired. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What I don't understand is why you ain't playing no rock and roll around here.  I knew this was going to happen, too.  I knew it.  The second I left, I'm like, why haven't they sat him in my seat?  I know these scumbags are going to do that.  He's having a ball over there.  He's touching everything.  Tom, don't put your mic.  Your mouth is not far.  You have to move your mouth closer to the microphone.  Yeah, you've got to get closer to the mic so we can hear you.  Get closer to the mic, Tom.  He can't hear you.  I got the headphones on.  Yeah, but get closer to him. 
[01:48:00]  I want the mic changed.  His lips are touching it.  Now I know everything I can't use anymore.  The mic, I'm taking the mic off and throwing it in the garbage.  Is your name Mike?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Where you been, Mike?  I'm here in fucking think-bomb.  You might think about getting rid of the chair, too.  He's going to piss me off, Mike.  Yeah, he's going to be gone.  When I get pissed off, I turn into the Hulk.  And I swear to God, I will come after you.  He is turning into the Hulk. 
[01:48:30]  Look at his legs are green.  Well, have fun with Tippi Tom.  I'm going to go to the Bahamas.  Hey, Tom.  Oh!  Take away everything in that studio.  Can I go?  You want to go to the Bahamas with me?  Yeah, why not?  Wouldn't that be great?  I could just ditch him there and have him squeeze out.  And you get to enjoy my company.  Hey, Tom.  It's hard to, it's hard to, it's hard to see. 
[01:49:00]  You have to adjust the Paltor cameras with that handle right there.  Because I want to, nobody can see.  Jesus Christ.  What about that?  They must spray alone.  No, get rid of that.  He's even touching the scent thing.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what's this for here?  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  That is somehow sound effects are very appropriate.  Anyway. 
[01:49:30]  That was Rocky Pitcher Horror Show.  Well, have fun with that stinky motherfucker.  I got to go.  Where are you going?  And I knew this was going to happen.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Go fuck yourself.  Thank you.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's Anthony on his way to the Bahamas.  That's not nice.  Yeah.  That was very uncalled for.  Yeah, that was very wrong of you to hurt my feelings, man.  I actually feel sorry for Ronnie because Ronnie has to sit in that seat at noon today. 
[01:50:00]  All right, Tippi.  Why don't you go get a beer?  There you go.  There's...  Well, yeah.  I want to get a beer.  Where the beer at?  Well, they're going to show you where the beer is.  Tippi Tom sitting in Anthony's seat.  Tippi.  I'm all hooked up here.  Tippi.  Get them over there to enjoy a beer.  Tippi.  Tick my horn.  Yes.  Tick the horn.  Tippi.  Have fun with it.  Oh, I got the beer here, man.  Oh, we have to sit over there.  Yeah, go ahead. 
[01:50:30]  Damn, I was having fun.  You want to hear a song?  Yeah, let's hear a little tune.  All right.  Give me time.  It's going to melt a song.  Yeah.  Hey.  Pull your bass down, man.  Hey.  Pull your bass down, man.  Hey.  Pull your bass down, man.  Let me see your ass.  Hey.  Pull your bass down, man.  Hey.  Pull your bass down, man.  Hey.  Pull your bass down, man.  I want you to go the nicest ass.  Check out the height.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  That's a booty.  Whoa.  Whoa. 
[01:51:00]  Eh, eh, ass.  Damn, that booty.  Booty.  Damn, that booty.  Booty.  Damn, that booty.  Booty.  That's a real ass.  Check out the height.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh.  That's real ass.  Oh.  Oh, God.  I want somebody.  Oh.  God.  Oh.  That's real ass.  Oh.  Oh.  God.  Oh.  That's the best ass I've ever seen.  My God.  Hold me back. 
[01:51:30]  I'm an ass man.  Take a few minutes to fumigate the room.  We'll be right back with Tippi Tom.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  And now, a messy moment in Tippi Tom history.  What's up, everyone?  It's Stinky, Awesome Garrett from the N.E.W. Days.  And I'm here to remember Tippi Tom.  I remember the first time he was in studio.  Anthony made me run down to Dwayne Reed to pick up some Vicks Vapor Rubs to rub underneath 
[01:52:00]  our noses, because it smelled so bad.  Here's to you, Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Continues.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's a tribute to Tippi Tom here on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Our favorite homeless person of all time.  One of our favorite guests of all time who died recently.  And we're celebrating his life on this show by playing some of our favorite Tippi Tom memories. 
[01:52:30]  Yes.  Primetime Sam Roberts, Iraq, and Danny for this session here.  Big tribute to Tippi Tom.  This bit is reading porn to kids.  Of course, Danny, you know better than anyone else, Tippi Tom viewed all people the same.  Yes, he did.  He liked straight porn just as much as he liked the gay porn.  Yes, he loved a woman's tits just as much as a guy's balls.  Or just in his words, as a man's tits. 
[01:53:00]  And if the audience had kids in it.  I like boobies.  I think he actually says that in this bit.  If this is the bit I'm thinking about, I think that's what Tippi Tom says.  But the thing is that he didn't mind that there are kids in the audience.  To him, it was all about enjoying life and everyone was included, whether they be adults or kids.  And he really did enjoy life.  So much so that he probably was doing this bit after he was sleeping in the studio for an hour.  After being drunk all night. 
[01:53:30]  After being woken up on the toilet bowl because he fell asleep taking a shit.  And then he comes in and delivers this golden piece of audio for you guys out there.  It's Tippi Tom reading porn to kids on The Man, The Stench, The Legend.  A tribute to Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom, The Man, The Stench, The Legend.  Hey Tom, why don't you...  Well, where is...  Tom's gone again.  Where's Tippi Tom?  What a complete wreck.  Tippi Tom's gone again.  Yeah.  I'll take them out with my buddies. 
[01:54:00]  Were you looking at it, getting all excited?  I'm not going to start masturbating yet.  But, uh...  Thank God.  Now this guy...  Jimmy wants a light cream sauce on his steak.  This guy's tough.  See if there's any stories to read.  Yeah, maybe there's like, uh, you know, the Penthouse Forum has their thing and maybe  they've got the equivalent.  All right, read us a little story, Tom.  There's a whole lot of jerking off going on here.  All I see is ass and dick and ass and tits. 
[01:54:30]  You know, what the fuck am I going to do with this?  You know, I feel like jacking off right now.  Feel free, Tom.  There's no stories here.  All I see is fucking and jerk off.  It's kind of awkward to do that when his boyfriend is right.  He can't put that on here.  What does this say?  All right, uh, the big print...  I know my glasses, so...  Well, I'm going to go like this.  Oh, yeah.  Dial up date.  Yeah!  I think he's going to blow this guy. 
[01:55:00]  And this guy's going to fuck him.  You've got to be more descriptive.  Look at that little kid out there.  Well, how more descriptive do I get?  You're getting a blowjob and getting fucked?  What more do I got to do?  You're going to suck his tits, too, I guess.  I don't know.  I wonder if Tom would like Kenny to hold him.  I don't know.  Is that his title?  I don't even know these guys.  I only know the guys I know.  I only know the guys I know.  That's profound.  Kenny's built like Vince McMahon.  Look.  Now, see this guy here? 
[01:55:30]  I give him a blowjob, because I like his dick.  Thank you very much, sir.  But I like pussy, too.  Girl.  These balls.  You've got a big dick, motherfucker.  I want to see some pussy, though, man.  You're not getting seen in that magazine.  Yeah, I want to see some twat.  I like pussy, too. 
[01:56:00]  I'm all for the dick, but I want to see some.  Oh, now we got some pussy here.  I like red and butter.  Oh, his tongue is going right up in there.  I like pussy, too.  Boy, she's humming.  Ooh.  He's licking.  Oh, my God.  What are you seeing there, Tom?  I'm seeing some guy licking some lady's pussy.  And I'm jealous.  Can you sing Clementine?  Oh, he's going to dick her.  He looks like Dracula. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, he's licking a pussy now.  Yeah, he's sucking her dick.  What is he doing?  Her dick.  Then that comes up in the grave and fucks his dick.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That guy got a tongue.  She got a dildo.  No, no, no.  He's so excited.  She's getting fucked in the ass.  Boy, this is some good stuff here.  You got that juice all over her chin.  A chin.  What the fuck is this?  This is some... 
[01:57:00]  A rhinoceros.  What?  Fucking a rabbit.  Where'd they come up with this shit?  I don't know.  That's why I want to go on that spaceship and get the hell out of here.  Go back to Mars.  That spaceship.  Oh!  Now we got some pussy.  Oh, I like this guy's ass, though, too.  You know, yeah.  Yeah, I'm an ass man.  You know, I mean, you know.  Say that again. 
[01:57:30]  I don't discriminate at all.  She ain't got no tits.  I don't discriminate at all.  I like big tits and nice ass.  Or a big dick.  Boom!  What now?  A whole lot of fucking going on here.  Come on, baby!  Tom's a size queen.  Yeah!  Now this woman I would definitely die for.  Oh, my God.  Let me see what else. 
[01:58:00]  Look at all this twat.  My goodness!  Dang!  Where'd you get this book at?  Man!  What is this dude?  A whole lot of fucking going on here.  What's this guy got a foot out of his ass?  What's going on here with this dude?  You got to...  What, he stuffed somebody up his ass?  I can't believe it. 
[01:58:30]  You're going to have to be a little more...  I'm more careful these days, you know.  I don't want no foot coming out of my ass.  Is that a public service announcement?  I don't mind a dick going in my ass.  Of course.  But I want no foot.  Oh, excuse me.  Yeah, well, I am...  Oh, my God.  Look at that twat.  She got pussy.  Shave.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:59:00]  I'll lick her asshole.  Damn.  Oh, she's got a dildo now.  See?  Once a woman get a vibrator,  the dick ain't going to work.  That's why I just think vibrators should be illegal.  Tom sounds like my subconscious  as I'm looking at a baby girl.  That's right.  I think this should be illegal.  I mean, you have a permit.  My God, my... 
[01:59:30]  I'm going to start jerking off right now.  Oh, no.  Great.  An AIDS sprinkler.  Oh, she's got a dildo.  She's licking her twat.  STD mist.  She's eating her cunt.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, they're sucking her tits.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Dildo in the mouth.  Dildo in the cunt.  My God.  Can we try something? 
[02:00:00]  What?  I'm going to jerk off like crazy.  Try bleeping this so we can play it on FM.  She saved her pussy.  It would be really funny because you would not hear more than a word.  I'm getting a hard on, man.  Get the kids out of here.  Stand back.  No, you'd have to get the kids out.  Get the kids out.  I think that's what the parents call.  No, they got to go.  No, no.  They would have to go.  I don't think it's that bad.  Oh, my God, man. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, she's bending over, too.  Oh!  Look at the children.  It's like the type of thing.  It's sinking.  The children are leaving the room.  Ah, stop me.  Hold me back.  I'm going in, baby.  I'm going to put your ass up like that.  Yeah.  Oh.  You getting a hard on there, Tom?  Oh!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I dare you to jerk off.  Those kids missed school today.  I might have to go to the bathroom.  I can't do it.  It's a Friday, right?  Oh, wait a minute.  It's August.  What the fuck is wrong with me? 
[02:01:00]  Man!  Whole lot of pussy fucking...  Look at them tits!  Damn.  I'm a tit man.  I do like titties.  You know.  You jerk off in public there, Tom?  Do I suck tits in public?  No.  Do you jerk off, like, out on the street when you get horny in public?  Well, I get horny, yeah.  Or do you go to, like, behind a dumpster?  Right here?  Get out of here.  Oh, no.  You're offering your money?  I don't want nobody to see my little pee-pee. 
[02:01:30]  I...  I...  No, I'm too shy.  I jerk off in private.  I don't jack off in public.  Tantalizing, tippy-ton.  I defy you to...  I got morals.  ...breathe in the same room.  You got morals?  I like...  I like to suck dick and jerk off and fuck in a restroom, in a bathroom.  Or in somebody's bedroom. 
[02:02:00]  I have a vibrator.  Send him into the bathroom with a mic so he can jack off.  Good idea.  No!  Go ahead.  I'm the real golden bun.  He's a liar.  He's a liar.  You want to see my buns?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus, no.  Damn bad.  Oh, no, the underwear.  This is horrific.  Look at this, Bill.  He has a drinking problem.  Look at this.  This is horrific.  Look how awful this is. 
[02:02:30]  What is he doing?  No!  I'll prove it to you.  Oh, no.  You're the real golden bun.  Ah!  Look at all the listeners with their back.  I'm the real golden buns.  The real ones.  Tom's...  Oh, Tom's got his pants down.  I'm the real golden buns.  Oh, God.  Don't look up, my little pee-pee.  Take a few minutes to fumigate the room.  We'll be right back with Tippi Tom.  The man, the stench, the legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197, XM202. 
[02:03:00]  And now, a messy moment in Tippi Tom history.  Hey, this is Keith the Coppin, sitting here reflecting back on some of Tippi Tom's special moments on the Opie and Anthony show.  And one of the greatest ones was probably when he made his first appearance back here at the satellite radio facility.  And we had a couple girls in the studio.  And they were doing some naked calisthenics on the, uh... 
[02:03:30]  What the fuck do you call this thing?  Holy shit.  Oh, console.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that what you're waiting for?  Fuck, man.  My memory's like fucking shot.  And watching Tippi Tom get all worked up, and I'm sure everyone remembers how excited he got when he wanted to jerk off on the stage.  And we promised him, apparently, that he could jerk off on the stage from what he said.  But, uh, he got so excited, he actually touched one of the girls. 
[02:04:00]  And I don't think I've ever seen a more horrified look on a person's face than when this naked girl looked down and saw Tippi Tom's hand on her thigh.  I think she could have died, and Tippi Tom did.  Tippi Tom, we miss you, pal.  Tippi Tom, the man, the stench, the legend, continues only on The Virus, Sirius 197, XM202.  It's, uh, the man, the stench, the legend, a tribute to Tippi Tom. 
[02:04:30]  Tippi Tom, our homeless man, our favorite homeless man who died recently, a friend of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts with Danny and E-Rock, also from the Opie and Anthony Show.  How great was Tippi Tom?  There was no one better.  Who was better than Tippi Tom?  And just, like, thinking about how we're never gonna have Tippi and Stu, like, it's sad, dude.  Like, who's gonna replace Tippi Tom?  There will be no replacement.  I mean, Tippi Tom is good enough that I wish, uh, Opie and Anthony would go off the air forever and we could just air Tippi Tom clips forever. 
[02:05:00]  I would love that, too.  This particular clip, too, is another one of those that has never aired since it originally happened.  Well, Tippi Tom's been a guest on the show since years before we were even on Sirius XM.  Back when we were on WNEW in the afternoons, before the show got fired, they had Tippi Tom in, and, E-Rock, you were able to retrieve this tape.  Tippi Tom was in, cursing up a storm, just describing homeless gay sex in the most vulgar of details, getting dumped out left and right. 
[02:05:30]  But we got the pre-dump tape.  Yes, this is the pre-dump tape.  The best part of this bit is where Tom realizes he's on radio and he can't say anything obscene or curse.  So he tries to set up that he's gonna be clean, and each time he does, he just blurts out...  Something terrible.  Yeah, I thought you were gonna do the voice.  Well, let's not blow for the loyalty.  We'll share, you know, if you're out there and you're listening to this for the first time, you're gonna love this.  And chances are, you probably haven't heard this before, so sit down, take a listen to one of the very first times, I think, that the show got to really, really know Tippi Tom in depth. 
[02:06:00]  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony presents Tippi Tom, The Man, The Stench, The Legend.  Tippi Tom, The Man, The Stench, The Legend.  There's a lot going on. Thank you, Keith the Cop.  Keith the Cop brought us a homeless person today, Anthony.  Well, this is one of our friends from the homeless shopping spring.  And he's already horrifying the new interns. 
[02:06:30]  He looks a little beat up.  Yeah, what happened to him?  He does look a little beat up.  Did you tune him up?  He says he fell down the steps.  Ah.  Fell down, he said.  That's what the cops tell him to say.  Tell him you fell down the steps.  Wait, Steve, why are you making that look?  Get on, Mike.  Is that Tippi Tom?  That's Tippi Tom out there, isn't it?  Yeah.  He's a babbling, drunken bum.  Are you babbling, babbling, babbling?  Yeah, yeah, you just heard that. 
[02:07:00]  All right, get him in here.  Tippi Tom was one of the homeless people we had for the homeless shopping spree.  There he is.  Steve, why don't you stand right about there?  There you go.  All right, what I'm trying to say is this.  Here's what I'm trying to say.  No, here's what I'm trying to say.  Yeah.  What am I trying to say?  You got a summer tan, bro, and a nice new sporty hairdo.  Yeah, I'm trying to say that. 
[02:07:30]  It's very Kiefer Sutherland.  Yeah, isn't it?  You look like Kiefer Sutherland, all beat up.  I don't know.  He's putting the beer in his pocket.  Now, what I'm trying to say is this.  It's open.  Yes.  You want to hear a joke?  Oh, a joke, a little comedy.  Yeah, it might be a guy joke.  Uh-oh.  Are there dirty words in it?  You can't say dirty words.  All right, Wonder Woman.  Wonder Woman was on the beach where the legs opened. 
[02:08:00]  I know this joke.  Jesus.  What are you opening up for Vos?  Four Fantastics.  Superman saw Wonder Woman, and he flew down and did a little thing.  He died in.  And then Hulk Cozen, he went down there.  Who?  Who?  The Hulk.  Oh, the Hulk.  The Hulk. 
[02:08:30]  He did a little bit with Wonder Woman.  And then the rock man, he comes down.  He did his thing.  Anyway, they all go back.  Wait, what's the thing they're doing?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let me get through this joke.  And they all get back to the fort.  And the invisible man shows up and says, my ass is sore as hell. 
[02:09:00]  Somehow it's so much funnier when you tell it.  Doesn't he look like he should be on a raft being rescued after about eight years at sea?  Wilson, Wilson.  You look like you've been shipwrecked.  He looks like he's been shipwrecked.  But now he's posing for the camera.  Didn't he used to be a gigolo?  I'm trying to remember Tippi Tommi.  Were you a hustler out on the street?  Were you a hustler out on the street? 
[02:09:30]  I'm a hustler.  You're damn right I'm a hustler.  I hustle the best.  I've been on the street.  I know how to shake my thing.  You're damn right.  I'm a hustler from way uptown to downtown.  You're damn right.  I hustle.  I'm getting big bucks.  Tippi Tommi.  Tippi Tommi got big bucks.  Tippi Tommi, where did it all go wrong for you? 
[02:10:00]  Somewhere on your road in your life, something went wrong that made you end up where you are.  Well, it all started back in San Francisco.  Yeah.  I went to a bar.  Right.  When I ran away from home.  Why'd you run away from home?  Oh, it felt like it.  And I went there.  I hitchhiked.  And I was in a bar.  Right.  And I was sitting at the bar.  Defining moment coming up.  On Market Street in San Francisco. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  And somebody came up.  Oh, I can't say this.  Oh, go ahead.  You want me to say it?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Say it.  He gave me a blowjob.  I know.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Wait a minute.  All right.  I'll just say it again.  Don, you can't say that.  That's true.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's true.  You can't say that.  Okay.  You can't say that.  Someone came up to you.  Say he gave you a Hummer.  So I started giving blowjobs.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  We're at a dump here.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Shut up, Tippy Tom, for a minute.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  He's killing us.  Tippy Tom, you can't say that.  So Ant and I.  All right.  I can't say that.  All right.  No, no, no.  You can't use that.  So just say Hummers.  What kind of clean stuff?  The guy gave you a Hummer, so you decided to give him a Hummer, right?  Hummers.  Just say Hummer.  A Hummer.  A guy gave you a Hummer.  Just say a Hummer. 
[02:11:30]  A Hummer.  A guy gave you a Hummer, and then you decided to start giving Hummers?  Yeah, Hummers.  Yeah.  All right.  And that's what happened?  Yeah.  Why is that?  If some guy, some guy walked up to you in a bar and said, I want to give you a Hummer,  and you said okay?  A Hummer?  What's a Hummer?  Well, everyone knows what it is, so don't worry about it.  And you said okay?  That'd be cool.  Right.  And you said okay?  Yeah.  Hey, let me tell you another little joke I made up. 
[02:12:00]  All right, Voss.  There's this lady.  This guy joke.  She's in the airport, and she got arrested.  They lifted up her dress, and they found two tons of crack.  You don't get it, do you?  That's the Oprah Winfrey joke.  Yeah.  You got it.  We got it, Tiffy.  I have no act.  So what happened?  So this guy gives you a Hummer, you give the Hummer back, and that's where it went all 
[02:12:30]  wrong?  Yeah.  You decided you liked it?  It was like Hummer, Hummer.  What's it called again?  Hummer.  Hummer.  Hummer.  Hummer.  Hummer.  So it was like Hummer, Hummer.  Hummer after Hummer after Hummer.  So you just kept giving them?  No, I didn't start giving them.  I just gave a Hummer just the other day.  And then I got a Hummer myself.  Wait, who did you?  What I'm saying is that.  Who did you give a Hummer to the other day?  Well, I got a buddy that I hang out with. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  What's his name?  And he liked to get the Hummer.  Right.  So I'd do the Hummer, and then he'd do the Hummer, and then that's what it was.  But there's other things that happened.  You're a good friend.  Like what?  What other things?  I can't say it on the radio.  Why?  Well, just say it.  No, I think you could say it.  Yeah, you could probably say it.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, I think you could say it.  I think you could say it.  What else goes on there?  I said he'd fuck me my ass. 
[02:13:30]  And then.  I ran.  Oh.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't say anything.  Keith, shut him up.  Shut him up.  Keith, shut him up.  Shut him up.  You can't say that.  All right.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Shut up.  Shut up.  What?  How did I know that's what he was going to say?  Wait a minute, Tom.  Wait a minute, Tom.  Hold on.  Shut the homeless guy up.  I'm not getting up behind.  You've got to wait. 
[02:14:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Get him out.  Hold on.  Hold on, Tom.  Wait, Tom.  Where is he?  No.  Get him.  Wait a minute, Tom.  All right.  Timmy Tom has left the studio.  I don't know.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't know what made the radio, but it looks like he.  He took it in the balloon knot.  That's what happened.  He goes, you know, I'll say it.  I like to get.  He said it.  You know how bad that must be to do to a homeless man? 
[02:14:30]  Oh, my God.  You know back there is just all brambles.  By the way, Anthony, that's not Tippi Tom.  Who is it?  That's our new consultant, John Minotti.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  He has been brought in to clean up this place.  Look, I just have to make sure.  You're not the friend he was talking about.  I know, Keith.  Very funny.  That's friends, boy.  Let me tell you.  Keith, you're going to just let him wander the hallways? 
[02:15:00]  No, no.  He's in the bathroom.  Oh, good.  Good, good, good, good.  You just know he doesn't have many bathing facilities.  So when he does this, like you just said, some balloon knot action that he got from his friend.  He said it much better than that, though.  Oh, he went right for the F word and everything.  There's like 15 people on hold right now that really enjoyed that last exchange.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And you know, to get to the balloon knot when you peel certain things, it's got to sound like a fruit roll-up coming off. 
[02:15:30]  Coming off.  The smell has to be horrendous.  The smell has to be, because it's just bad coming off of him anyway, but imagine that area.  Yeah.  Ah.  Like, you ever pass by a dead animal and that pungent smell of rotting flesh?  You guys, I got an idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What if Lady Di gave Tippi Tom...  Oh, my God. 
[02:16:00]  Can you get Lady Di in the...  Oh, my God.  This is good.  I won't even put it to a vote.  If Lady Di does this, she stays with the radio show.  She stays on the show.  Oh, boy.  And so does he for tolerating this.  Get Tippi Tom back in there.  I got to make sure he goes that way as well.  Where's Tippi Tom?  He's in the bathroom still.  Still?  All right.  Uh-oh.  Well, we're trying to get Lady Di.  Lady Di has Until Tomorrow to figure out what she's going to do for the show.  What the hell is she going to do for the show? 
[02:16:30]  That is so sick.  He sure told us a lot.  Come on.  I got a cigarette around here.  Tippi Tom back in town.  All right.  Who does?  You're...  Give me a cigarette.  Give me a cigarette.  Give me a cigarette.  Give me Tom on a cigarette.  Give me a cigarette.  Give me a cigarette.  You got a cigarette?  Here, you can take it.  Where are you?  I don't have one.  Tippi Tom, you can take it right out of his back pocket.  No, you can't.  What's up with this?  You got to take it right?  Earl?  What's Earl?  Look at Keith. 
[02:17:00]  He's been laughing at him.  All right.  What I'm saying is this.  Tom, what happened to your eye?  I fell down the stairs.  What stairs?  At 8th Avenue Port Authority down there when it was raining a couple days ago.  And you fell down the stairs.  I fell down the one side on 14th Street, and then I slipped on the water, and I went  all the way down and banged my head.  Imagine seeing that happen.  Would you just be laughing your ass off if you saw him going ass over tea kettles? 
[02:17:30]  And what happened was this.  Yeah.  I woke up.  I'm bleeding like crazy.  Right.  I think it's time to go to the hospital.  And I got to block.  Yeah.  Because I wasn't going to, I don't like doctors, period.  So I just, like, stayed there by the church next to the hospital, St. Vincent's, downtown.  Yeah.  I'm bleeding more. 
[02:18:00]  And somebody called, somebody called the ambulance and said that I have to go to the hospital.  And I said, yeah, you think so?  And so the blood has come gushing out of me.  And I said, I think maybe you're right.  And so they call the ambulance.  Yeah.  They put me in there.  I'm bleeding all over the bed. 
[02:18:30]  Everything is just coming out like I'm, ugh, I couldn't believe how much blood I lost.  Right.  And, yeah, yeah, that's what I did, infusion.  Donate some blood, you know.  Oh, yeah.  And, um.  Imagine slipping in that puddle of whatever.  And what happened was, is that they wanted to stitch me up, but I didn't feel like getting  a stitch.  It was too painful.  They wouldn't give me no, St. Vincent's wouldn't give me no.  You take your buddy's junk in your balloon knot? 
[02:19:00]  No, I'm mad at St. Vincent's right now.  No, you take, you take your buddy's.  Pessed off at them.  You take your buddy's junk inside your balloon knot, and yet, uh, that hurts?  The doctor's stitching you?  What?  Your, your buddy.  You said he, he put his junk in your balloon knot.  Oh, that was last week.  I'm talking about.  But, but, but the, uh, but the eye hurts?  Yeah, I hit my head.  Yeah, but what about your ass?  My nose?  Well, I, uh, I don't know what happened to that.  But I, I'll figure it out.  Hey, I want to know where he has all this action. 
[02:19:30]  If he's a homeless guy.  Hey, where do you go to have sex?  And the cops, we're not around.  Where are the cops when I'm banged up?  Tippi Tom, where do you go with your friends at this?  Tippi Tom, I want to know why the, oh, the cops don't have no problem picking on the homeless,  writing out tickets, but where you at when we fall down and bust our ass?  All right, calm down, George Carlin.  Hey, Tippi Tom. 
[02:20:00]  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom, I got to ask you a question.  Tippi Tom, I got to ask you a question.  Where do you go to have these sexual encounters with your friend if you're homeless?  Oh, are you talking about getting late?  Um, well, uh, it depends.  I mean, it hasn't happened for a long time.  You said just last week.  Well, he's a little scared.  His piece of comm is right next door.  Let's see.  Where do you, where do you go?  Last week, it was, I forget who I was with, Tippi Tom, because I'm a slut. 
[02:20:30]  I'm a slut.  But where do you go?  You got to have some privacy somewhere, right?  Well, yeah, I know where to go with privacy.  Well, I usually hang downtown.  Uptown, no privacy, too many people.  So downtown what?  You go into an alley and bend over a garbage pail?  Somewhere around behind a dumpster or something like that.  Imagine walking down that alley, turning your head past the dumpster, and just seeing Tippi Tom get nailed in his balloon knot. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I get, well, yeah, when you get banged.  When I get banged, I like the jerk.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, we understand, but you can't say that.  Hold on, hold on.  Well, he likes to, uh, yeah.  Let me down, no.  All right, hold on, hold on. 
[02:21:30]  Let me down, you sick ass.  He likes to get banged, but then he likes to take care of himself while he's getting banged.  I like the jerk.  Right, just say that.  That's okay.  Don't use the jerk.  Don't say that.  Yeah.  But so you like to take care of yourself while the guy is taking care of himself with you.  Yeah, exactly.  If it go that way, it may go the other way.  So I might have to do him like that.  The reach around.  Then you got to give the reach around.  And then I have to do him like that.  Wow.  This guy is...  You're a good actor.  Get out.  Wow, what a trooper. 
[02:22:00]  That's the way it go.  Do you like girls too, Tippy Tom?  I had a girlfriend.  Yeah.  And I can't say this on the air.  In Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.  What?  Yeah.  Let's hear about this girlfriend.  Let's hear about the girl in your life.  Because we want a girl...  I only had one girlfriend my whole life.  Really?  Did you have sex with her?  Yeah.  And you didn't enjoy it?  The thing she liked was she liked me too. 
[02:22:30]  Can I say it on the air?  Well, I don't know.  Wait, wait.  Do you think?  Well, let's think about this.  Do you think he can say it?  Yeah, I think Tippy Tom.  Well, you know what?  I like your nigga pussy!  Don't say it.  No, no.  All right.  He couldn't say that.  Hold on, Tom.  Don't say it.  Don't say it again.  I think we just found our new midday show here in New York.  Oh, my God.  Okay. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  He likes to go dining.  Right.  He likes to eat at the Y.  He likes to dine.  Yes.  All right, Tom.  Don't say that, though.  But we understand.  Just say you like to eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y.  You know, you eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y?  Eat at the Y.  Okay.  All right?  So she wanted you to do that.  Eat at the Y.  Eat at the Y.  You know.  That's what I did.  All right.  And did she enjoy it?  I did eat at the Y.  Did she like it? 
[02:23:30]  That's what I did.  And?  Tippi Tom know how to do that.  Did she enjoy it, Tippi Tom?  I don't know if she liked it or not.  Yeah?  But it turned out you liked...  She was pumping my face.  That means she liked it, Tom.  Right.  Is that okay?  That's okay.  That's good.  But then, Tom, Tom...  Pumping my face?  Tom, at one point, then, you decided you liked men more than women?  Well, I liked them both.  Now, the thing is, I had more boyfriends than girlfriends. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  But my boyfriend, Gary, well, you know, he...  We broke up.  And the one girlfriend I had, Philomena, she didn't like me because I was going out with Gary.  And so I was like, you know, what am I going to do?  I'm dizzy.  Why'd you break up with Gary?  Was it over the hockey game with Oprah?  No, I didn't break up with Gary.  Gary was mad because I wanted to stay with Philomena, too.  Right.  Yeah.  I wanted them both.  I wanted a bimbo on my right, a bimbo on my left. 
[02:24:30]  I wanted two bimbos.  And they didn't like...  Tom.  Tom.  Did you ever...  You know when we were talking about eating...  I was screaming.  Tom, Tom, wait a minute.  When we talk about eating at the Y with a girl, did you ever do that to a guy?  Where you, you know, go around back?  Oh, I licked some ass, man.  You can't say it?  No! 
[02:25:00]  Hold on.  Okay, hold on.  Keith, shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Be quiet.  Why do you have a delay?  I'm trying to say it in a way, and he just comes out and says it.  I'm just screaming to cover up anything else he's saying.  He's just yelling he's a slut.  I know, but he was saying something else, too.  So, Tippi Tom has...  Right.  Toss salad.  Yes, he...  Toss salad.  Yeah.  I don't think we heard that.  It's okay.  All right, Tom, why don't you take a break?  Pop down someone on the phone lines. 
[02:25:30]  I want to see if they're hearing this.  Yeah, let's go to John.  John.  Hey, John.  Hey, what's going on?  Have you heard what we're dumping out of here on the show with Tom?  Yeah.  He just said that one of his friends was choking to death, and he gave him the hiney lick maneuver.  Hey, I got a question.  I'm waiting on...  Is this guy white or black?  White.  A white guy.  He's a white dude?  Yeah, he looks like...  What would you say he looks like?  He looks like Kiefer Sutherland if Kiefer Sutherland was beat up.  Now, when he gets shot in that film when he's in court, that's what he looks like. 
[02:26:00]  I think he looks like...  He does.  He's got, like, light hair.  So, he looks like a guy that's been on a life raft for three or four months, out in the sun, all beat up, with a big beard and everything, just trying to be rescued.  What's happening?  He used the bathroom.  There seems to be a little mishap in the bathroom.  What happened?  What happened?  Opie's going to look.  Opie is going to look.  A mishap in the bathroom?  Oh, and Jim Norton's going, I can't, I can't look, because stuff like this totally disgusts me. 
[02:26:30]  Did he...  Oh, my God.  Open that door.  Hold the door open.  Let me hear the reaction.  He's talking about the intern.  We got a new girl intern.  Uh-oh, what's the matter, Jim?  Awful.  What was it?  It's just...  It's just...  It looks like butterscotch pudding all over us.  Oh, God damn! 
[02:27:00]  And the seat, and the back of the seat, and...  It's actually a nice color for a throw rug.  All over the back of the seat and everything?  Oh.  Yeah, smeared.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, man, juice will lighten up that color.  That might be what it was.  Where are we going with this?  All mixed in there.  Are we going to try to get Lady Di to do something to Tippy Tom?  Yes.  Yes.  What do you want her to do?  Toss salad? 
[02:27:30]  Dude, what about it?  Come on, you got to go for the gusto.  She's got to toss his salad.  If she just gives a hummer, or lets Tippy Tom do the Y, the ultimate rusty...  You guys are crazy.  That will never happen.  What if she...  She will never do that.  She's got to toss salad.  I think tossing salad.  I think the odds are slim to none that she'll even just do the hum.  What if we let Tippy Tom eat at the Y? 
[02:28:00]  That's far worse for him.  That is, but it's funny as hell.  Well, where the hell is she?  He's not at home.  All right.  Well, Lady Di, you need to call the show immediately, okay?  And we'll take a break.  He's just sitting on the Ikea furniture.  Screaming.  Screaming and yelling.  Ah!  Look at this Sam Adams.  He's barking.  He's barking.  He likes you, huh?  Yeah.  From Stinko Records, it's the new collection of covers from America's favorite derelict. 
[02:28:30]  I'm the original golden boy.  Tippy Tom, regurgitated.  Tom Jones.  It's not unusual to be in love.  He's drunk.  Smells like feet.  It's not unusual.  And he's forgotten most of the lyrics.  That...  Tippy Tom, regurgitated.  Chews up your favorite pop hit.  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She's a lady.  And spews them back out dirtier, grittier, and stinkier than farts and old beer. 
[02:29:00]  But the lady is mine.  Something like that.  From your favorite haunting melodies.  Riders on the storm.  Something like that.  To your most cherished classic rock cut.  Come on, baby, light my fire.  Tippy Tom hunkers down, craps all over him, and refuses to wipe.  Time to sit tonight on fire!  And if you act now, you'll receive Tippy Tom's tribute to the town he calls home. 
[02:29:30]  I've been stuck on Frank Sinatra.  Start spreading the news.  It's old blue eyes.  I'm leaving today.  Meets old crusty eyes.  I'm gonna be a part of it.  New York, New York.  It's a sappy salute to the city that broke his spirit, crushed his dreams, and left him  blowing strange men for cheap wine in the Port Authority bus terminal. 
[02:30:00]  If I can make it here, I can make it.  Tippy Tom.  And he wins.  Regurgitated.  It's up to you.  New York.  New York.  That's my vote.  Wrapped in a special carrying case, brown in the back, yellow in the front, just like Tom's underwear.  Call 1-800-NO-T-CELL right now.  Your copy of Tippy Tom. 
[02:30:30]  Regurgitated.  Any more requests?  We'll return with more of Tippy Tom.  The man, the stench, the legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the man, the stench, the legend. 
[02:31:00]  A tribute to Tippy Tom here on The Worst of Opian Anthony.  I'm E-Rock from The Opian Anthony Show.  Primetime Sam Roberts is over there.  From The Opian Anthony Show, among other things.  And Danny is also next to me, E-Rock.  Hello, everyone.  From The Opian Anthony Show as well.  From The Opian Anthony Show.  And we're going over some of the older Tippy Tom clips.  We just heard when he was in studio one of the earlier times getting dumped left and right.  And this is another clip from before we were on Sirius XM when we were on WNEW in the afternoon.  This is another segment that has not re-aired since it originally happened. 
[02:31:30]  During this point in the show, there used to be some old characters, Lady Di and Marion.  And at this point, they were trying to phase them out of the show.  Which is something that phasing, I know it's a bit of a tangent,  but phasing Lady Di and Marion out of the show is something that they tried to do for about seven years.  And it just doesn't happen.  Well, in this particular segment, they've been trying to phase out Lady Di first.  She had to come up with a stunt in order to stay on the show and prove herself worthy of being part of the show.  Well, that's a hot show. 
[02:32:00]  So they bring Tippy Tom in.  Lady Di's on the phone.  And while they're trying to explain this to Tom, Tom starts soliciting sex from her.  What else would you do, Danny?  I mean, if Tippy Tom didn't like sex, what did he like, you know?  I hear you.  I don't even remember this bit too much.  And usually I'm good with all the old stuff.  And I can't even wait to listen to this because I don't think I've ever heard it.  Then enjoy it with the rest of us here on The Man, The Stench, The Legend, a tribute to Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom, The Man, The Stench, The Legend. 
[02:32:30]  Tippy Tom, the homeless guy's outside the studio.  Tippy Tom.  Getting hamid.  He wants to sing his Rod Stewart song, Anthony.  Lady Di is on hold.  Well, tomorrow is the day for Lady Di.  Tomorrow is the day.  We gave her about a week and a half.  And tomorrow is the deadline for her to come up with an idea that she will present to us and perform.  I don't know.  It could be a stunt.  It could be her sitting in front of a mic and talking.  Just anything that might impress the listeners. 
[02:33:00]  Then the listeners will be put to vote and they will decide whether Lady Di will be on our show ever again.  Or if she will just disappear.  Lady Di.  Yes.  Hi.  How you doing, Opie and Anthony?  Pretty good.  How's everything?  Hi, Jim.  Hi, Jim.  One of the heavy, nervous breathing.  No.  Lady Di, you come up with any other ideas for tomorrow?  I just have a few.  That's all. 
[02:33:30]  Well, tomorrow is the day.  So now is the time to tell us.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to stick to my singing tomorrow.  I heard what you said before.  I don't think I'm going to go that drastic.  Get Tippy Tom in here.  I think there's something we can work out.  Maybe there's something we can work out.  Oh, no.  Dave, on line three, you're saying have Lady Di do a Tippy Tom butt chug.  A Tippy Tom what?  Butt chug.  You like beer.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  No.  All right.  Is he coming in?  I can hear him yelling out there.  He has to finish chugging the beer first. 
[02:34:00]  Make sure he stays on mic the whole time because he tends to drift.  Oh, thank you.  Where do I go, right?  Look, he's got a wow shirt and wow hat on now.  All right.  What are we talking about?  He has his wow stuff on now?  He's got all of his wow attire on.  Tippy Tom.  Good.  Hey, Tom.  Yeah.  On the phone right now is Lady Di.  Lady Di is on the phone.  Say hi to Lady Di.  Hi.  Lady Di?  Yeah.  Hi, Tippy Tom.  Hi, Lady Di.  How are you?  All right.  How are you doing?  Can you hear her? 
[02:34:30]  Can you hear me?  Let's make sure.  Say it again, Lady Di.  Say it again, Lady Di.  Hi, Tippy Tom.  Hi.  How are you?  All right.  How are you?  I'm all right.  That's good.  Yeah, man.  Just hanging out.  Right.  Right.  Nothing wrong with that.  Lady Di?  Hey, let me ask you a question.  What?  Are you available?  Am I available?  Are you single?  I'm single, but, you know, I'm not really looking for anyone right now. 
[02:35:00]  I'm a good looking guy.  You're not looking for anything right now.  You're such a liar.  I'm not looking for anyone right now.  What?  I'm not looking for anyone right now.  What's wrong with Tippy Tom?  Huh?  What's wrong with?  Tippy Tom, good looking, man.  I didn't say anything was wrong with him.  Yeah.  Why are you knocking Tippy Tom there, Lady Dot?  I'm not knocking him.  I'm trying to get a date over here.  You're not going to go out with anyone yet.  But you leave me alone.  All right, Tippy Tom, why don't you work your magic and talk to Lady Dot?  I can't say that on the air.  Hey, hey, Lady Di.  Yes?  Can Tippy Tom use your stink spot for a finger cleaner? 
[02:35:30]  No.  What I'm really trying to get into it.  Hold on.  Hold on, Tippy Tom.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's decide.  No, I'm trying to get something across there.  I'm talking to some chick.  Okay, you have...  What I want to know, if she want to fuck.  No.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No.  Hold on.  Everyone hold.  Hold.  Oh, hey.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on.  I heard that.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on.  Don't say it.  Don't say it again.  Tippy Tom, say it again.  Don't say it. 
[02:36:00]  He has needs, Anthony.  Don't say it, though.  Yeah, you have needs.  Let's just say that.  Don't use that F word.  I have needs.  You have needs.  Everyone has needs.  I'm a human being.  Okay.  I want to fuck.  Oh, my.  No.  No, hold on, Tom.  Turn the mic off.  I'll be.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Poor Tippy Tom.  We've run out of dump now.  Tippy Tom, you can't use that word.  Don't use that word anymore.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't use that one.  That's a bad one.  Yeah, that is a bad one.  No more bad words.  No more bad words.  No more bad words.  You can't use that word.  That's a bad word.  All right.  You want some good words?  You want some poetry?  No, no.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Until that dump light turns back on.  Not yet.  You want to hear a joke?  Not yet.  Hold on.  We'll get to it, though.  We'll get to it.  You can tell me a joke if you want.  Shut up.  Lady Di, shut up.  He did it.  All right.  Do it.  Lady Di.  Yes.  We're going to suggest a few things.  We have an idea that will guarantee you we'll be a member of this program that you'll 
[02:37:00]  be able to come back on with Mary and whatnot.  Was it what I heard before?  Not exactly.  Okay.  There could be a few things here.  Yeah.  There's a few things.  Would you be up to tossing Tippy Tom's salad?  No.  No.  You can't be in trouble, man.  You can't be arrested.  You are in a row.  Oh, man.  Well, okay.  Well, you want to give her the one idea that I think might work?  All right.  I'll work on that one. 
[02:37:30]  Go ahead, Tippy Tom.  All right.  Who's next?  Who's next?  Did you lick my balls?  No.  No.  Now I'm at a dump again.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Jesus.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Shut him up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What's the matter, Tippy Tom?  Shut up.  I understand.  He wants to know if Lady Dot will lick something on him.  His yam bag.  His yam.  No. 
[02:38:00]  No.  All right.  Lady Di, would you give Tippy Tom maybe a quick handy?  No.  No?  No.  I heard some of those ideas before.  You could wear a glove.  No.  Lady Di, if you wear a glove and give him a handy, you will be able to continue being  on this program.  No.  I don't know if I want to do that.  No.  Why?  Huh?  Why?  Because.  No.  I can't do that. 
[02:38:30]  What's wrong with you?  Huh?  You're getting into my trouble here.  No.  There's nothing wrong with me.  All right.  How about this idea?  How about this idea?  What's that?  You put on.  I think it could be Tom.  You put on a stress.  Tom, don't talk right now.  All right.  Is that a good idea?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Don't talk yet.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Stop.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Oh, Jesus.  What are they saying? 
[02:39:00]  Shut him up.  His language is really bad.  Shut him up.  Shut him up.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Tiffy Tom, take a break.  Take a break.  Bye.  He just started screaming, I want to F your A.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  Uh-uh.  Tiffy Tom.  Any more ideas? 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  All right.  Uh, Lady Di.  Yes.  Here's the deal.  What's that?  You will strap on an appliance and service, uh, that man.  I don't know.  You're thinking about it, though.  How would I, how would I service him?  If you, if you strap on an appliance.  He's a gay gentleman.  Okay.  And then, you know, you have to do the deed with the appliance. 
[02:40:00]  Do you want any more ideas?  No, it wouldn't, it wouldn't be your actual, uh, skin, though, because it's an appliance.  Right.  It's hygienic, and it's just, it's not, it's not even actually a sexual thing.  Oh, my God.  You wouldn't even be touching him.  Hmm.  You understand what I mean?  There's nothing, uh, wrong with it.  What is he yelling out there?  Why is he yelling out there?  I'm an old-fashioned faggot.  Yeah, get him out, get him back on.  He's old school.  Ugh.  Did he die?  Yes, I'm right here.  You gotta do something with Tippy Tom.  Your singing is horrendous, and it's not gonna keep you on the show. 
[02:40:30]  My singing is not that bad.  Oh, there's no breathing heavy.  Hey, I see John.  No, I'm not, I'm not breathing heavy, I'm sitting down.  There he is.  All right, Tippy Tom, you're a what?  An old-fashioned faggot?  I'm tired of this, uh, bullshit talk.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Now, what I'm saying is...  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Don't use the S word.  Keith, hold on.  Don't use that word.  We just ran out of more dumb.  Hold on.  That's a bad word.  Hold on, don't...  No more bad words.  Okay, thank you. 
[02:41:00]  No more bad words.  Stop writing the bad words down.  We just want to know.  His fault.  Listen, listen to what he's saying.  Tippy Tom, we just want to know.  You're an old-fashioned faggot?  Is that what you said?  Are you...  You're an old-fashioned faggot?  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  Now, I'll tell you this right now.  Ever since two years old, huh?  Shut up, Lady Di.  Yeah.  I knew I was a faggot when I was two years old.  Oh, yeah?  How did you know?  Yeah, because I...  What?  I knew. 
[02:41:30]  Lady Di, stop asking him questions.  Yeah, I'm queer.  Okay, I'm a queer.  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Who?  Yeah, you're right, Lady Di.  Okay.  All right.  You had a second-year-old motherfuckers.  No, no, no, no.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Take your balls and go somewhere back.  You're right.  I'm a queer.  And I've been a queer.  And they're right.  And I'm four.  And I...  That's right.  Okay.  So I'm queer. 
[02:42:00]  I'm back.  Who cares, right?  Who cares?  So what?  So what?  I have girlfriends, too.  Yeah.  Hey, do you use protection there, Tippy Tom?  Do you use the condoms?  Excuse me?  Do you use the condoms when you're doing that?  Yeah, I use...  Well, I don't...  Do you have the Ninja?  Not much lately.  But, yeah.  Yes, you have.  Are you afraid of getting AIDS, Tom?  You don't die of AIDS.  You die of something else.  You might get HIV, but you don't... 
[02:42:30]  I know people living 20 years old that don't have AIDS.  You don't die of AIDS.  Dr. Tom.  You die of a cold.  Right.  I'm encouraging.  What happens is it just makes it so other things kill you.  The immune system is down.  But so aren't you still...  You might be afraid that if you keep having unprotected sex, you're going to get the AIDS. 
[02:43:00]  You can get the AIDS.  But it don't matter.  You're not going to die of that.  You're going to die of something else.  That is a rationalization I have not yet heard.  You know something?  Living outdoors, don't you think you're going to get a cold?  You walk down the street, you get shot in the head.  Right.  What are you going to do?  If you're behind a dumpster, you can get shot in the face.  Yeah, right.  If you're shot in the ass, that's even worse.  Right.  You don't die of AIDS. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  But it kind of helps the other diseases kill you, though.  Exactly.  So aren't you afraid of maybe...  You're actually right.  Aren't you afraid of maybe getting it and giving it to other people or something?  I don't know.  I don't give it to other people.  I have sex with nobody.  You just said a week ago you had sex with your friend.  Nah, somebody give me a blowjob.  No, wait a minute.  So I got a blowjob.  I'll say it again. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, man.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, Timmy.  Oh, Tom, you're a classic.  All right, Tom.  You sure is.  You're a classic.  We said you can't say that.  You can say Hummer.  Yeah.  You know, you're still...  You got a...  Yeah, yeah.  You could still get the AIDS from that, though.  Yeah.  So what?  You get hepatitis C, which I've had for 20 years.  Oh, Jesus.  You can't catch it from nobody.  It just happens. 
[02:44:30]  You get it from food.  They don't even know where you get it from.  Your liver.  You only got one liver.  You got one heart.  You got two eyes, two ears, two arms, two legs.  I'm sure the liver is three lobes, which you can live with.  It could be Tom.  You only got one liver.  And yes, I got liver cancer.  How many feet do you have?  And that is what I've been going on with.  And...  You got the liver cancer there, Tippy Tom? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  How'd you get that?  No, they'll put needles in my stomach to pull out pieces.  But I know I'm going to live another 30 years.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I told the doctor that.  You better stop drinking, hon.  Lady Di's telling Tippy Tom to stop drinking?  Are you insane?  No, I mean, if he has something wrong with his liver, he shouldn't be drinking.  Lady Di, look in the mirror.  Yeah, take it easy, Lee Remick.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Remick.  Do it.  Drinking ain't had nothing to do with it. 
[02:45:30]  No.  Right.  No, no, no.  Drinking had nothing to do with it.  Just keep drinking, Tom.  It's not from drinking.  That's what I say.  All right.  Well, let's let Lady Di go.  Lady Di, you're not going to do anything with Tippy Tom?  I don't think so.  I think the appliance is a good idea because you don't have to use anything really.  There's no skin-to-skin contact.  The appliance is the best one.  It's a strap-on type thing, and it's safe.  Well, we'll see.  Okay?  You know, that's something for me to decide. 
[02:46:00]  I hope he doesn't have tuberculosis.  I mean, you know.  What do you mean you need to decide?  Do you need to sit down and talk with your family?  Just do it.  No.  You want to put your strap-on in my ass?  No.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I will think of something before I go on the show tomorrow.  That's the idea.  I think that's the one, the thing.  I think the little strap-on appliance is the best one.  Would you help me with that, Mort?  No, but it's not actually a sex thing.  Lady Di. 
[02:46:30]  What?  Come on.  I'm on stage now.  Lady Di.  Are you going to be up there tomorrow?  Can I fuck your face?  Jesus.  Guys, I will come up with something.  Don't worry about it.  Okay?  Hold on, Mort.  Hold on.  We are so out of dump, it's ridiculous.  Tell Tom to take a break.  Hold on, Tom.  Tell Tom to take a break.  Tom, grab another beverage, man.  Yeah, go take a break.  We'll get you back in a minute.  Grab a beverage.  Go take a break, Randy.  Take a break.  You dropped something, Tom.  Can I F your face? 
[02:47:00]  No.  Not at all.  Why is he pointing at me?  What's your problem?  What's wrong?  Don't bully him.  But why is he pointing at me?  What'd I do wrong?  What?  He's a blackout.  He wants his mic, man.  He wants his sink.  What's wrong?  He's on there.  What happened?  I thought I was going to get a beer.  Now, where? 
[02:47:30]  There's no beer out here?  I'm going to get you a beer.  Have a seat.  When?  What?  Next month?  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Thank you.  You're more like him.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom, come here.  Tippi Tom, sing your song before we go to break.  Yeah, Rod Stewart.  We're not getting out of this beer.  What?  We got to talk to him.  Sing your Rod Stewart.  No, just sing your Rod Stewart.  What are your three choices?  My three choices of life?  You want to sing Rod Stewart?  You said you had three choices you were going to sing.  Oh, rock and roll?  Or what category? 
[02:48:00]  Hey, what are your three categories?  Look how calm he gets when he has a beer in his hand.  What category?  Category.  Category.  I left my heart.  That comes from mine first.  In San Francisco.  Look at your colon in San Francisco.  It's not to mention it's T-cells.  I know.  It calls to me.  Little cable cars.  Now, who am I singing about? 
[02:48:30]  Anybody got any idea?  San Francisco?  Tony Bennett.  What was his name before he was Tony Bennett?  Tippy Tom.  No?  His name was Anthony Benedico.  You know who gave him his name?  Wow.  I assume his parents.  No.  Bob Hope said, you ain't Anthony Benedico no more.  You are Tony Bennett.  Bob Hope.  You know who he is?  Of course.  That's how he got his name. 
[02:49:00]  Thanks for the memories.  That guy, Bob Hope.  Yeah, sing.  Sing.  As we go to break, Tippy Tom.  Sing us out.  Little angel.  All right, let me belt one out here.  Belt one out.  Rock and roll.  Some rock and roll.  Some rock and roll.  Okay.  Let's go.  English or American?  You pick.  All right.  Hey, if you want my body and you think I'm sexy, come on, baby, let me know. 
[02:49:30]  Woo.  Got it.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Who did that?  Rod Stewart.  Yes.  Yes.  Your stomach has something in common with his.  All right.  All right.  All right.  It's too easy for you.  All right.  All right.  Why don't you take a break, Tippy Tom?  All right, Tom.  Go out.  Enjoy your...  Oh, you got another?  Give us another song.  All right.  Give us another song.  Give us another song.  I got plenty of songs. 
[02:50:00]  Well, give us one.  I love music.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Let me think.  Let me think.  Let me think.  Let me think.  I'm thinking right now.  I'm thinking.  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  Okay.  Too, Tom, thinking.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Something that you might get.  Yeah.  If I go way back, you're not going to get it.  Tom, just sing anything right now.  I want you all in the club, because I tell you right now, Bing, be out of the club. 
[02:50:30]  You can't guess this one here.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Okay.  Rock and roll 60s stuff.  All right.  60s stuff.  Go ahead.  All right.  All right.  Let's rock.  All right.

[02:51:00]  Ah, shit.  I'm out of the club.  You can't curse like that, Tiffy Tom.  Wait, wait.  No, no, no.  No more cursing.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hurry up.  We got to take a break.  I'm going to get hard and nasty.  All right.  Let's rock.  Go ahead.  We're going to get down.  American.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Riders on the storm.  Boom.  You got it? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Is there anything you know more than three words to?  No.  Riders on the storm.  He might know.  Into the...  The doors.  Come on.  Let's go.  What?  It's the doors, but it's...  He got it.  Yeah, but we want you to sing it.  It's not a contest.  Hey, no.  We're out of the way.  We're not playing trivial alcoholism.  You're out of the club.  He in the club.  You're out of the club.  All right.  All right.  You want some more rock and roll?  No.  Why don't you take a break?  We're going to take a break. 
[02:52:00]  All right, Tippy Tom.  Wait outside.  Enjoy your beer.  Come on.  They're singing right now.  We're going to come back.  Enjoy your beer there, Tippy Tom.  We'll have you back in.  You dropped something.  And we've got to get the girls in next.  Listen to this spray.  Spraying everything.  Oh, my gosh.  All right.  Let's go.  Get easy, Howard Hughes.  I don't play one.  Pugs.  I creep up on you.  Yeah.  All right.  Pugs.  Pugs. 
[02:52:30]  All right.  We'll break, and we'll try to get out of this tailspin, guys.  If you want my body, and you think I'm sexy, come on back and let me know.  Lonely?  You're damn right.  Looking for the time of your life?  Are you single?  Hygiene, not an issue?  Hepatitis C, which I've had for 20 years.  Sit back, lube up, and dial Tippy Tom.  Because I'm a slut.  He's homeless, smells like a dumpster, and he's horny. 
[02:53:00]  Can you lick my b***h?  For a bottle of Thunderbird, he's all yours.  I'm a human being.  I want a b***h.  Guys.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot when I was two years old.  Girls.  I have girlfriends, too.  He's so drunk, he doesn't care.  All right.  Who's next?  Just name the place, and he'll be there.  We're around behind a dumpster or something like that.  Call 1-900-SYPHILIS for the ride of your life. 
[02:53:30]  I know how to shake my bed.  Not responsible for any diseases contracted as a result of sex with Tippy Tom.  You're damn right.  We'll return with more of Tippy Tom.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  And now, a messy moment in Tippy Tom history.  Hey, it's Dr. Steve.  I first met Tippy Tom sitting on the bleachers about an hour before the Opian Anthony show was supposed to go on, 
[02:54:00]  and I'd arranged for Keith the cop to bring him into the studio as part of my ongoing bit,  or should I say penance, of doing prostate exams live on the air under progressively worse and worse conditions.  And part of me was really hoping that Keith couldn't find him, and I could call off the bit.  But Keith just proved to be just too good, and the bit was on.  Anyway, when I got to the studio, there was already a pretty big audience on the bleachers, 
[02:54:30]  and they were all sitting as far away from Tippy, who was sitting on the front row of the bleachers, as they could.  And the stench was unbelievable.  So I just sat down with him to do a pre-interview.  He was sober at the time, and I was really struck by his innate sweetness and his eagerness to participate in whatever he had in mind.  He was totally cool with everything.  He was really interested in what we were doing and what I had proposed for him,  and I had arranged for him to have a real physical exam at a real clinic after the show. 
[02:55:00]  I was expecting Tom to be a total wreck physically.  He had some bad veins in his legs, and that was about it.  When it came to do the rectal exam, I put on my isolation suit and prepared myself mentally for a real horror show.  But amazingly, his pants were clean, and compared to the rest of him, his ass smelled like flowers.  Of course, after the show, Tippy got drunk afterward and puked on the floor,  and one of the interns had to clean it up, and he refused to go to the clinic appointment, and I never saw him again. 
[02:55:30]  And here I proclaimed him healthier than Fez Watley on national radio, and a year later, he's dead.  So what do I know?  I only met him once, but I do miss him, and I will never forget him.  We hope you enjoyed the fresh air.  Now get back into the stinky with Tippy Tom, the man, the stench, the legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197, XM202.  Well, this is when I was in the hospital. 
[02:56:00]  I fell down.  Oh, Tippy.  It's the man, the stench, the legend.  This is the man, Tippy Tom.  A tribute to Tippy Tom.  Now, this is...  Now, who am I talking to?  Well, I'm Sam.  E-Rock is here, too.  And Danny was here a moment ago, but Tippy, I guess it's amazing, because I thought you were dead.  That's the whole reason we were doing this show.  You go to heaven, but you are not drunk.  You are sober in heaven.  Well, obviously, this is E-Rock. 
[02:56:30]  This is sober, Tippy Tom, that's with us.  Amazing.  And I've only been sober once before.  I was walking down 14th Street in the village, and I hit my head.  You did, Tippy.  And they brought me to the hospital, and I got all cleaned up.  Wow.  Well, I hope that we got a chance to maybe, like, get some kind of a phone call from you or something.  I remember somebody from your staff came down and just wished me so well.  Well, we only hope the best for you, Tippy. 
[02:57:00]  This is Tippy Tom in the hospital.  An amazing phone call.  A sober, Tippy Tom.  I can't wait to hear it.  This has not been heard since it originally aired.  Seven years ago.  He's got a wonderful confession.  Yeah, about when Tippy Tom was 10 years old.  Oh, that's right.  Yes, Tippy.  I remember that.  Well, Tippy, we're going to go ahead and play the bit on The Worst of Opie and Anthony Presents  The Man, The Stench, The Legend, a tribute to Tippy Tom. 
[02:57:30]  Tippy Tom, The Man, The Stench, The Legend.  Okay, Keith the Cop is in the studio.  We're going to get a Tippy Tom update.  Yeah, Tippy Tom was supposed to be the showstopper today, the return of Tippy Tom.  We've been hearing things that his leg might be falling off his body.  He might be in a hospital.  We had a huge surprise.  Yeah.  Now, when the huge surprise meets the good old boys.  Oh, no.  Oh, I didn't even think about that.  We could have a problem today. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, my God.  Maybe we should tell the good old boys that the surprise is for them.  Hey, we're the good old boys.  Bring this clown in here.  Here's the lead singer.  You're going to look pretty funny eating corn on a cob.  No F in teeth.  Mike, you won't.  Well, we got Barley Scotch, the lead singer of Hasey Dixie.  Wow, look at the tits on this one, Ryan.  Look at the rack.  We're going to knock on the jugs.  Look at the whiskey jars.  It was supposed to be for this guy, Tippy Tom.  He's a homeless guy, roams around New York City, and apparently he was supposed to come in, 
[02:58:30]  but apparently he had an accident, and his foot is gangrenous,  and he's in a hospital where they're pondering cutting it off, Keith?  Yeah, that's correct.  The last time he was here, I remember he was all banged up in his face and everything.  He fell down the subway stairs, and he had stitches in his head and his leg,  and he just continued to drink and not get it taken care of.  So I'm looking for him today, and I ran into one of my friends, and I said,  you've seen Tippy Tom.  He goes, yeah, they're cutting his leg off over at the hospital.  I says, oh. 
[02:59:00]  See, now they have.  Make sure they keep that.  Yeah, we have a pickled punk jar.  Put it in one of the pickled punk jars.  We could do something with his leg.  You're not trying to imply that the drinking wasn't good for the leg, were you?  Nah, not.  See, I don't want to be a part of no show that in any way promotes the notion  that any kind of concept whatsoever, the drinking ain't good for you.  What are you kidding?  There's four things in this world worth singing about,  drinking, cheating, killing, and going to hell.  And I do the first two on a regular basis.  I'm sure I'll get to the next.  I'm sure it was definitely easing the pain.  Yeah, see?  It helped them out. 
[02:59:30]  So there will not be an appearance by Tippi Tom today.  We'll have a call-in.  We can call Tippi Tom.  Oh, you got his hospital number?  Yeah, I went down.  I saw him in the hospital.  How does he look?  Not like Tippi Tom.  Really?  He kind of looks like...  Did they clean him up?  He's very...  Oh, no.  Cleaned up.  Oh, they cleaned him up?  They're going to ruin our character.  I walked in there, and all I could think when I saw him was, wah, wah, wah, wah.  I was like, oh, no.  You're ruining the bit. 
[03:00:00]  You're saving the man's life, but you're ruining a bit.  So, you know, he'll tell me about the whole thing.  But he's cleaned up.  I stayed around.  I paid for his telephone.  I'll expense that.  Jeremy, thank you.  Hey, look at that.  Nice.  I guess the big surprise is going to be for the good old boys.  Now, see, Tippi Tom was supposed to get a surprise today, and Tippi Tom is a man whose  sexuality is in flux, let's just say.  I don't know if we want to give away the surprise.  I'm not giving away any surprise.  I'm just saying that's the kind of guy he is. 
[03:00:30]  I'm giving a little background on Tippi Tom, because I don't know if they'd appreciate  the same types of things that maybe Tom would.  That's all.  We're going to have to wait and see.  Same types of things in life.  I mean, anything.  A wine, you know, movies.  Are you willing to accept the surprise that we had for Tippi Tom today?  My body's a rock and roll temple.  So you're open for anything?  Well, not necessarily.  I'm open to the possibility of entertaining the option of anything.  All right.  Can you be a good sport today, is what we're asking.  It depends on what you mean by sport. 
[03:01:00]  Sport?  You'll have to wait and see.  Well, you know, I do have a gun.  You do?  Aren't you?  Well, you know.  All you guys do.  That's great.  We're from the South.  I love the South.  We're from the Appalachian Mountains.  With guns, that's fantastic.  In my opinion, if you can't kill a cow, process that cow, and make your own hamburger meat,  you have no right to eat a hamburger.  Moral indignation.  Hallelujah.  I like the way you think.  If you can't make your own whiskey, you have no right to walk into a bar.  You want to order a big, tall glass of whiskey? 
[03:01:30]  Hey, cut us some slack there, okay?  I was with you with the burger thing, but I got a drink.  As long as you cut me some slack on this big surprise, man.  All right.  Well, you'll have to wait and see.  Could get a little weird in here today.  But first, we got to go live to the hospital, our buddy, our pal, Tippi Tom.  How are you doing, Tom?  Hi, how are you?  How are you feeling?  Oh, I'm feeling like a million bucks now.  I'm telling you, everything's just going fine. 
[03:02:00]  Now, can you please explain to me, which one am I talking to?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie?  Yeah, you're talking to both of us.  Wow, you sound even gayer when you're sober.  So it's two against one here.  No, we're not ganging up on you, Tippi Tom.  Wow, he does.  But, Tom, you've got to explain to us what happened to your foot.  Well, here's what happened.  About ten days ago, I was having a good time just strolling down 14th Street, right? 
[03:02:30]  He sounds so gay when he's sober.  And, you know, I was half lit up, and I was, you know, I was just being, just my normal thing.  Right.  But it was raining out, so I wanted to get out of the rain.  And, you know, on 14th Street side, on 8th Avenue, they got that fancy new slick tile they're putting down that.  You know, they're spending $650 million to redo the subways.  I was reading about this.  Hey, Mario, can you give the phone to a tippy-tom? 
[03:03:00]  And the thing is this, as I was coming down the stairs, my foot slipped, and I went over, head over heels.  Ass over tea kettle.  Yeah, halfway down the, yeah.  And I landed on my feet.  Thank goodness.  And, but I, the one foot must have caught the corner of the stairs.  This can't be seen, God.  And it ripped a good chunk.  Oh, it did.  Yeah.  So I had to get it fixed.  Yeah.  And then the other foot just got bruised. 
[03:03:30]  And, you know, and a few other bruises here and there.  So I had to spend a little time here.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I think I'm going to spend about another week, and then I'm going to be ready to roll.  You think?  They're going to save your foot there, tippy-tom?  Mm-hmm?  They're going to save the foot?  I'm going to, what, the foot again?  They're going to save it?  They're not going to lose your foot, right?  Uh, no, no.  I was, I thought at first I was going to get a wooden foot.  And then I'm thinking, well, maybe I can live with that. 
[03:04:00]  Is that a new position?  But no, no.  It looks pretty, they said, no, you're not going to lose your foot.  Because I was, you know, I was panicking, you know, because it was pretty bad.  I hear they cleaned you up nice.  You got to shave and everything, huh?  I'm shaved up, bathed up.  I mean, I am, oh my God, I'm gorgeous.  I just, I'm serious, man.  I've never seen myself look so good.  Yeah.  And I'm going to try to stay this way.  Are you? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Well, you are, you don't even sound like tippy-tom.  You know something, Tom?  I'm sober now.  Yeah, we have had you up here in this studio a couple of times.  And you were, you sounded different.  You were a little louder.  You were a little more like you were having more of a good time.  I understand you're in the hospital now, so it's not like a party atmosphere or anything.  But there's just something about the timbre of your voice.  Something about the tone that's a little different when you were up here, as opposed to the way you sound now. 
[03:05:00]  It's a bit gayer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of like recovering from, you know, a battle zone, a war.  You know, you're not quite there yet.  You know, it's going to take me a while to recover.  Yeah.  But when I recover, I'd love to come back on the show.  Hey, we know you love singing, tippy-tom.  Can you sing Do You Think I'm Sexy?  Well, okay.  Well, hey, come on, baby. 
[03:05:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, no, no, no.  I don't know if I can get it out of here.  If you want my body.  I'm sexy for myself.  Yeah.  Give me the right tone.  Hold on here.  Let me see if I can get it going here.  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  Let me stretch out the broken knee here.  Okay.  You want to hear Do You Think I'm Sexy?  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  Which one?  The version by Tippy Tom or Rod Stewart?  The Rod Stewart version.  I was talking.  This is going to be rough. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, you caught me off guard here.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Everything.  Yeah.  You want to...  Something like that?  Yeah, right.  She walks along looking for attention.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you think I'm sexy?  Come on, baby, baby. 
[03:06:30]  Come on, let me let me know.  If you really need me, come on, baby, please.  Come on, let me let me know.  It's the best I can do for now.  All right.  We're going to the hospital, you know what I'm saying?  Right.  As soon as I get my head together and I get behind that microphone and I get my voice  back.  The microphone.  Yeah.  I got you.  Do you remember being up here, Tom?  I sure as heck do.  You do?  I was up there with Rock and Roll Tommy.  No, no. 
[03:07:00]  Do you remember the last time you were up here?  You were smashed.  You were up here with just us and Keith.  Do you remember that at all?  Do you want me to maybe I'll play a couple of, have him say it first from the hospital.  Oh, okay.  I have clips of you here, Tom.  Okay.  A taped clips of you saying certain things up in the studio last time you were here and  you were tying one on pretty good.  We were all drinking a little bit.  And we want to hear the contrast.  We want to hear the sober Tom and we want to compare it to the tippy Tom.  Now, all right. 
[03:07:30]  The first thing you say is I'm a faggot and I've been a faggot since, since.  Yes, I've been a faggot.  I was two years old.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  Well, shout it out.  Well, that is true.  Yeah, but we want to hear before we play the tape of it.  Yeah.  You say I'm a faggot.  I've been a faggot since two years old.  Well, we want to hear you yell that out now and then we'll play the tape and see the difference in sound.  Well, okay. 
[03:08:00]  You're serious.  Yeah.  I knew that I was a queer or a faggot or whatever you want to call it when I was two years old.  Tom, just say I'm a faggot.  I've been a faggot since two years old.  I've been a faggot ever since I was two years old and I knew it right from the start.  All right.  So that's tippy Tom sober.  This is how he said it really wasted in our studio.  Now, Tom, this is how you sounded.  Listen.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old. 
[03:08:30]  See, you're a little louder.  I don't have much.  See, I'm kind of like on the medication now.  Yeah.  Give him a couple of the other ones, Anthony.  All right, Tom.  You were giving us a little knowledge about HIV and AIDS.  And you were telling us how you don't die of AIDS.  You die of a disease that you get because of the AIDS.  Now, from what I've read, but you know what's interesting? 
[03:09:00]  This is what's even more interesting.  Not Tom anymore.  No.  No, I'm teasing you, of course.  This is what's more interesting.  They want to know why.  We're going to sneak some booze into the hospital for you.  We want the old tippy Tom back.  We'll put some Jack Daniels in your IV.  Tom, just repeat after Anthony.  Yeah, now you've got to say, you don't die from AIDS.  You do not die of AIDS.  Okay.  You die of something else.  All right, that's good.  Here's the way you said it up in the studio that day.  Listen closely.  You don't die of AIDS! 
[03:09:30]  You see, you're yelling.  Booze takes the gayness out of you, is what we're trying to say.  Booze kind of takes that gay edge off of you.  You don't sound really as gay, and you sound like you have a lot more energy.  You don't die of AIDS!  Oh, my God.  Now, the last thing you said was, you don't like queers, do you?  Was that it?  Did I say that? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  I said, I don't like queers?  No, no.  You said that the people around you that day, you were talking to them and said, you don't  like queers.  Yeah, I think a lot of them don't.  Really?  On behalf of our mom.  Just say, you don't like queers.  You don't like queers.  All right, and here's how you said it in the studio that day.  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  See, you sound a little different.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old. 
[03:10:30]  You were really cooking that day, Tom.  Well, I was probably feeling kind of good that day.  Yeah, you told us all kinds of stories about how you would have sex with other men behind  the dumpsters.  Oh, that's possible.  Yeah.  And, well, not only behind dumpsters.  Well, that's the one that you were telling us about an instance where, you know, he bent  over and then you bent over and there were all kinds of favors being given. 
[03:11:00]  Well, there was one time when I was about 10 years old, right?  And this is a very, this is a real story, too.  And this guy, Eugene, I used to hang out with.  We used to hang out in these old, you know, these houses that they were building, right?  And this is how I got my hemorrhoid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I, I, we were playing around and he wanted to, you know, he wanted to do the thing from  behind.  Right. 
[03:11:30]  And so what happened was this, is that when I bent over, um, he struck a match and, um,  and I think that's how I got my hem right.  I can't say.  He, he, he lit a match and then touched it to your balloon knot, let's just say.  He, he, right, he touched it to my, well, why the hell would he do that, Tom?  Well, that's what I don't understand.  And he thought it was funny.  He was laughing.  He wanted a hot piece of ass.  And, um, I'm, I, I'm saying, wait a minute, you don't, why are you heating it up like 
[03:12:00]  that?  And, uh, and, uh, I mean, it was, it was like that.  Right.  And, and, uh, and that's how I got my hemorrhoid.  Since you were 10?  Uh, around, yeah, eight or nine or 10 or something like that.  And so, you know what I did to him?  Well, what?  Uh, late at night, I once took my dad's hacksaw.  Yeah.  And I hauled his bike halfway down through, right?  Oh, his bicycle? 
[03:12:30]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  So he comes right down the road, like, because we're mad at each other now.  I was mad at him.  Well, you had good reason there, Tippy Tom.  Because my, my hiney all hurt.  Oh, hey!  He said, he said hiney, so.  Yeah.  That probably, uh, skated through.  That's right, yeah.  You didn't say hiney.  You were, you were hurting, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, so he comes right down the road, like, a big shot, and his bike split in half.  And one end went that way, and I'm just laughing.  I'm just, oh, what?  Yeah.  Well, you sure got him.  Oh, I did. 
[03:13:00]  And this is, that's a true story.  He falls off his bike.  You got a match in the keister.  All right, we should get out of here, man.  Yeah, Tom, uh, well, uh, get well soon.  Yeah.  Uh, we'll keep, uh, getting updates on you, and maybe, um, when you get out, and you're  all shaved up nice and everything, you can come in, and we can get you drunk again.  And we can get this thing going.  Now, you know, you know, you guys had a whole nice little selection there underneath the Cosby  table.  Of music or booze?  Booze.  Oh, booze, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  Are you going to go back to the booze?  Well, well, no, I'm going to just try to stick with beer.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  That always works.  All right, thank you, Jamie Gum.  All right, well, are we done?  Oh, yeah.  All right, Tom.  I'll keep in touch.  I got Keith's number.  I'll figure out your number, and, um, maybe in about a week, might take me two weeks to  get over this.  I don't know.  All right, Tippi Tom.  I hope your foot feels better soon.  Thank you for letting me on the air, and I'll try to come up with, I'll try to be a little 
[03:14:00]  more energetic.  Take care of yourself.  There he goes.  Tippi Tom, live from the hospital.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  What happened?  You're killing everyone around you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you doing to yourself?  Oh, my God.  Wow, that is completely...  What did you do to him?  Thanks.  What did you people do to him, Keith?  Do you want to move on to Blue or something?  Do you want me to pick up somebody else?  Maybe we need a new homeless guy. 
[03:14:30]  You can't be straightening these people out.  It ruins the bit.  This AA crap stinks.  I think Rock and Roll Tommy cleaned up his act, too.  Oh, no.  We got to get...  What about the show?  Come on.  We got to get new guys this year.  What about little Ziggy?  Now, Ziggy, we haven't seen...  Remember, he cleaned up.  We had him up here.  Yeah.  He was boring, too, but I think he's back on the sauce, but...  Thank God.  Let's shoot for him next time.  What do these homeless people...  What do they have to not drink for?  They got a drink.  You're in hell. 
[03:15:00]  Let me tell you.  Yeah, the boost takes the gayness out of him.  Takes the gayness.  Listen to him.  You don't die of AIDS!  And then he's like...  I have a theory.  You don't die of AIDS.  Sounds like Mr. Blackwell, the fashion guy.  That's horrible.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  And then we got to...  You don't die of AIDS!  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  And he says that, and you're like, what?  You don't sound like a faggot. 
[03:15:30]  Yes, I was.  Remember, a match was lit.  And my balloon knot was hit with a lit match.  That's what gave me the hemorrhoid.  Not the miles of sea that has been in there since I had been that age.  Hey, Keith.  What's up?  Opie.  Yeah.  You are the coldest heart...  I mean, you are just ruthless.  What do I do?  Oh, my God.  I've been nice to two girls today.  Nice to two and just about 40 yesterday. 
[03:16:00]  Then poor Tippy Tom comes on.  Oh, you're not a drunk, slithering piece of dog crap.  I am.  I'm just going to...  You're not good for the show today, so I'm just going to make fun of you while you're  laying there in bed.  I'm painkillers, man.  You're just ruthless.  Do you have a heart at all?  Hold on.  Yeah.  I was out of that conversation.  Anthony was talking to him.  Yeah.  Come on, Opie, man.  I like you.  Your little comment you make from the sidelines say way more than Anthony could ever say,  man.  You're not supposed to know this is that good.  Yeah.  You're going to do inflections, man. 
[03:16:30]  Stop.  All right.  Stop.  You dick.  Oh.  Like, I'm not speaking the truth?  Who's bummed?  Who's bummed?  I'm bummed.  Thank you.  Didn't we have another guess that something like that happened to another character?  Yeah, the kid that came in for the staple gun bit.  Oh, God damn.  What a disappointment that was.  We were so excited.  We thought we found a new character for the show.  Smokey.  Smokey.  Smokey.  We were sure he was retarded.  We were certain he was retarded.  And he was drunk off his ass. 
[03:17:00]  He was doing the staple in the ass contest.  And he was the hit of the show that day.  Next day, he calls up, hey, guys, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  We were like, who's this?  Whoa, I had a little too much to drink yesterday.  Yeah, a little dry.  Sorry if I was out of control, but that won't happen again.  But I hear you want me to be a new character on the show.  No.  Not you.  The Smokey that was in yesterday.  And now, tippy-dumb, hi.  Hi.  We could drive down south a few blocks and get 20 of those guys. 
[03:17:30]  God, I just picture him with a shave and an ascot on it.  I pictured him.  I'm laying there.  Big, oversized Charles Nelson Reilly-type glasses.  Big glasses on.  And the robe pulled up like he's holding it way up to his neck.  It's very chilly in here.  I'm feeling a chill.  A bit of a chill.  I don't know.  I want to get out of here, but it's nice.  They've cleaned me up a bit. 
[03:18:00]  And I'm just picturing him laying there like, what happened to this guy?  You don't die of age!  Where's he?  Where's this guy?  I've got to play this.  You goddamn EMS people.  You ruin everything.  Who reported him that his foot was falling off?  I think he just fell down in the street.  And someone picked him up?  The person that picked him off the street should be fired.  You're ruining our show, you bastards.  Stop!  You leave him in the street.  So what?  He loses a foot.  He's still come up.  There are a lot of people bummed today. 
[03:18:30]  I'll say it again.  The booze takes the gayness out of you.  Well.  He's like, oh, I've been gay.  And it's like, but he's talking like he was bi.  And, you know, he had the girlfriend.  So it was like, you know, this homeless guy, he's out of his mind or something.  And then, well, you just saw the phone.  Yes.  Well, I'm on some medication, so I don't sound as up and peppy as I usually do.  No, you sound really gay.  Tippi Tom, the man, the stench, the legend. 
[03:19:00]  I see that.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197, XM202.  It's the man, the stench, the legend, a tribute to Tippi Tom.  And Tippi Tom is indeed dead, which breaks all of our hearts.  But he's still with us here in spirit and literally in studio.  The cleaned up Tippi Tom that we've been listening to.  Well, this is what Tippi Tom sounds like when he's sober.  I was walking down the street.  Yes.  And I was in the, I fell down. 
[03:19:30]  Well.  I tripped on the sidewalk.  No, Tippi, we know.  We know Tippi.  We know from before.  You just heard it.  But remember what was brought to your hospital?  Well, you guys are the best.  And you brought me one of the greatest presents anyone's ever gotten for me in my life.  Really?  You enjoyed it?  Oh, it was fantastic.  Eric, you would enjoy something like this, too.  No, that's not for me.  Well, okay.  I thought something different.  Eric, if you're ever in the hospital, I hope someone gives you a present of this magnitude. 
[03:20:00]  Well, enjoy the present with Tippi Tom and the rest of us here on The Man, The Myth, The Legend.  And a tribute to Tippi Tom on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Tippi Tom, The Man, The Stinch, The Legend.  Both of us are very disappointed that Tippi Tom is so gay.  Yeah.  Yeah, that and he's no fun when he's sober.  No, you know, we just talked to him on the phone.  He was at the hospital.  He had this foot injury that was turning gangrenous.  Yeah.  And they brought him in.  You remember the last time he was in, he sounded like this. 
[03:20:30]  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  You don't die of AIDS.  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  No, he said he was gay, you know, at least bi.  But he didn't really sound it there.  Yeah.  When he was here in the studio.  We got him on the phone at the hospital, completely sober.  They cleaned him up.  He may be on some kind of antidepressive medication.  I don't know.  But he was an older gay man.  He sounded very gay.  Pretty much it.  Yes.  Well, I would love to come up and see you guys again. 
[03:21:00]  Real soon.  Real soon.  Well, with that said, we had a huge surprise for Tippi Tom today.  Yeah.  That ain't happening because he's in the hospital.  And I don't think it really fits anyone that's here today.  No.  The good old boys, I don't think they want our little surprise.  They made that perfectly clear to us during the commercials.  You don't think Casey Dixie would like the surprise that was meant for Tippi Tom?  No.  Hey, guys.  I'm at the hospital.  Oh, okay.  Good. 
[03:21:30]  And in the room of the one and only Tippi Tom.  How does he look?  I didn't recognize him.  Really?  Keith was truly correct.  He does not look like when we last saw him.  He almost looks like a, I don't know, Robert Redford-ish.  Stop it.  I'm serious.  Oh, that's wonderful.  They shaved his beard, right?  They shaved his beard.  Uh-huh.  Did you take the digital camera?  Of course I did.  Oh, take some pictures of Tippi Tom.  Because we'll do a whole before and after thing. 
[03:22:00]  Yes.  Because we got the old pictures of Tippi Tom.  Right.  He looks totally different.  I mean, if you saw this guy right now, you would not recognize him.  Robert Redford-ish.  Yes.  Very.  But his surprise is in the other room changing right now, so it's going to be out in a second.  You want to make one million dollars?  Let me sleep with your boyfriend.  I'll give you a million dollars.  So, his surprise is getting ready.  His surprise is almost ready. 
[03:22:30]  What do they need to do what they have to do?  Well, he would need some music, but he might be able to do it without the music.  Does Tippi Tom have any clue what's going on?  Tippi Tom, do you have any clue what we're bringing you here for your surprise today?  Hello.  What's that?  Hi.  Hi, Tom.  Who am I speaking for?  It's Opie and Anthony again, Tom.  Who?  Opie and Anthony again.  Oh, how are you doing?  Hi.  We brought you a little surprise.  Oh, you did? 
[03:23:00]  Yes.  Oh, you know, you're the only visitors I've had.  Well, you have a couple of more that are coming to see you.  Oh, come on back.  They're getting ready right now, and they're going to come into your room, and it's going  to be wonderful.  All I know is I had such a good time when we went on that shopping spree.  Oh, shopping spree.  That's right. 
[03:23:30]  That's when we met you.  All right, put Rick back on the phone.  Rick's with the dark hair, the one I was just on.  Hey, Tippi Tom, do you think Rick is hot?  Huh?  Do you think Rick is hot?  Is he hot?  Yeah.  He's real good looking.  I think you're all good looking.  What are you, crazy?  Would you give him a baby?  I come in fourth place around here.  Would you burn his balloon knot with a match?  God, he sounds like Tom from New Orleans. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  A little bit.  Where are you originally from?  Huh?  Where are you originally from?  Originally, I'm from New Jersey.  Jersey.  And then you went out to San Francisco.  Well, no.  I went out to Reno, Nevada and San Francisco.  San Francisco.  He never said it like that.  I know.  If you guys are just getting in your cars, you missed the whole thing.  Tippi Tom was supposed to be here, but we found out he's in the hospital because his  foot might fall off.  It turns out his foot is going to be saved, but he's really sober and they shaved his beard 
[03:24:30]  and now he sounds really gay.  You do sound a lot gayer than you did when you were up here, Tom.  Oh, you mean I sound more gay now?  Yeah, you sound a lot more gay now than you did when you were up here.  Well, I'm more gay when I'm straight.  How about that?  When I get a little drunk, I get a little less gay.  I get a little more faggoty.  You'll get a little more butch when you're drinking.  A little more butch.  All right.  Where's Rick?  All right.  Put Rick back on.  Here.  Here.  Here's Rick right here. 
[03:25:00]  He's the good-looking boy with the muscles.  All right.  Hey, guys.  This show is too gay, man.  It's the, yes, hand the phone to the good-looking boy with the muscles.  It's amazing how true it is.  What, that you're good-looking and have muscles?  Besides that, he really, when he, dude, when he talks, he really looks gay.  Of course he is.  No, but I mean like his hand moves a certain way.  Oh, really?  He's got all the gestures down.  I can't wait to see the pictures.  But as he's laying there in his drug-induced half coma, he doesn't look it until he starts 
[03:25:30]  to, you know, talk and move.  Can he get out of his bed?  Because you've got to get pictures.  I don't think so, because he's got his legs pretty well wrapped up.  Yeah, he can't open.  He's got a leg injury.  He's not going to get out of bed.  You've got to prop him up nice so he can do a before and after picture thing with him.  But he does have shaved legs.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right, Rick.  We've got to go with this surprise.  All right.  Yeah.  Is it ready?  Danny, you ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Give the phone back to Tom, then.  All right.  We're going to give the phone to Tom.  Tom, you ready?  And then cue the big surprise.  And here's your surprise. 
[03:26:00]  Tom?  Tom?  Oh, hi.  Tom, here's your surprise.  Just let us know how you like it.  Yeah, it's your birthday, buddy.  We'll give you a little dance there.  Let's take a look at this here.  Oh, my God.  See, I used to look like that.  Oh.  Yes.  Yes.  I used to look like that.  Ah, no.  Mr. American.  Is he in a Mr. America uniform, I guess? 
[03:26:30]  Oh, my goodness.  What does he look like, Tom?  I mean, this is material.  Oh, God.  Jeez, whiz.  What's he doing?  I'm not quite sure what he's doing yet.  I'm going to figure it out in a minute.  What's he wearing, Tom?  Well, he's got a tuxedo on.  Yeah.  Do you like it or not?  Well, how can you not like it? 
[03:27:00]  How do they not like this?  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, why don't they have a song or something?  Right?  Well, maybe we can put one on low in the background here.  Come on, Rick.  Get him into it.  Come on, get into it.  Howdy, faggot.  I'm dizzy right now.  He's all dizzy.  My blood pressure's rising.  So what's going on there, Tibby Tom?  He's dancing. 
[03:27:30]  Tom, what's your name?  Tom.  What's your name?  One, two, three.  Which side do you want first?  Tom, what are you doing?  Well, what I'm doing, I'm farming something.  He needs a little more farming.  What are you doing to him, Tom?  That's solid.  That's solid.  Tom, what are you doing to him?  That's solid.  Let me see. 
[03:28:00]  You can't touch that.  Tom?  Oh, you can't touch that.  What did he go to grab for?  I don't know.  I don't know what to do with that.  I thought this was my oxygen line.  Feel these bicep.  You're in good shape.  Oh, he's feeling it.  I'm going to look like that in about six months.  Yeah, right.  I'm going to look like that.  Wonderful.  All right, Tom, you like your surprise?  Hmm?  You like the surprise?  Yeah.  Now I've got to wait until I get healthy and get in shape and get my confidence up. 
[03:28:30]  I don't know if I'm going to quite compete with that, but...  You got anything going on because of your surprise?  Mm-hmm.  You got anything going on?  I have anything going on.  I don't even want to know the answer to that goddamn question.  Tom, were you spanking him?  Just a little bit.  And did you try to grab his junk?  Uh, yeah, but he said that was, you know, not yet. 
[03:29:00]  You know.  He reached over and tried.  One thing at a time.  I thought it was the button to call for the nerves.  I grabbed the hose and I was pushing the button.  Ah, well, that's great, Tom.  Is it making you feel better?  Yeah, I feel a lot better.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Hey, Tom, can you repeat after me? 
[03:29:30]  Well, I have to admit, that was pretty good looking there.  Can you repeat after me?  That, that, that.  Oh, this is going to take forever.  I just wanted to say, b-b-b-boy.  What's his name and his phone number?  All right, hey, Tom, give the phone back to Rick.  Oh, okay, yeah.  I need someone to paint a picture here.  I got to know what the hell was going on in there.  He's so fixated on the young man.  All right.  Rick, what happened?  Um, well, he got a little, uh, laying down lap dance type of thing. 
[03:30:00]  Ah!  Why wasn't there any music?  Well, because we didn't have any music.  Okay.  You didn't have a boombox?  Plus, if we did, they probably, the nurses probably would have ran in here and stopped us.  All right, so, uh, the guy got pretty much, uh...  Yeah, I've got, I've got pictures, not pictures that I'm proud of, not pictures that I want to look at.  Right, but they're pictures nonetheless.  But they're pictures nonetheless.  All right, and is it true that Tippy Tom, uh, went for a grab?  He went for several grabs.  He did the, uh, tushy squeeze.  Oh.  He was, uh, checking the firmness of several parts of his body. 
[03:30:30]  Sure.  Sure, buddy.  Sure.  And it looked like he enjoyed himself?  Oh.  He looked like he didn't know where to start.  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  All right, this is, this has become one of the weirdest days, I'll tell you.  Ugh.  All right, Rick, thank you.  All right, guys, I hate you.  Can't wait to see the pictures.  Sure.  All right.  There they go.  There you go, and, uh, Tippy Tom enjoying his, uh, male, uh, lap dance. 
[03:31:00]  Male dancer.  Oh.  So, it would have been a lot better in studio with a drunk Tippy Tom, but there you go.  Blah.  I don't think that guy's gay, though.  Nah, a lot of those guys get more trim than anybody.  He's coming back here.  We'll, uh, we'll find out, I guess.  I don't know.  Wow.  Fine.  By asking him.  Wonderful.  Take a few minutes to fumigate the room.  We'll be right back with Tippy Tom.  The man, the stench, the legend.  Only on the virus. 
[03:31:30]  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  We hope you enjoyed the fresh air.  Now get back into the stinky with Tippy Tom.  The man, the stench, the legend.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's, uh, the worst of Opie and Anthony presents the man, the stench, the legend.  A tribute to Tippy Tom as we look back on Primetime Sam Roberts along with E-Rock and Danny from the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're looking back on the Opie and Anthony show as not only the favorite homeless man, but possibly the favorite guest of all time. 
[03:32:00]  Tippy Tom.  He was a legend.  You know, this program is being coined the man, the stench, the legend.  But Tippy Tom really kind of was a legend.  I mean, there's nobody that's going to fill the void that Tippy Tom leaves in his, you know, in his wake.  There really won't.  And it's painful as we introduce this bit to say this was Tippy Tom's last.  Yeah, I was about to say, like, this, it's, you know, it's going to be tough to listen to because not only is this going to close out, uh, this particular show, but this was really the last time that any of us really saw Tippy Tom. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  It's, uh, Dr. Steve came in, the resident doctor of the Opie and Anthony show, and he gives prostate exams.  Yeah, in order to, um, promote the show that he would do on a Saturday night, uh, Opie came up with this idea that anytime Steve's in town, he's doing a prostate exam.  Um, so we've done some other characters, and this time we got Tippy Tom in. 
[03:33:00]  And I'm amazed that, uh, I mean, and Steve was totally cool with it, too.  Yeah.  He's like, I have no problem sticking my finger in a homeless man's ass, but, uh, he was a trooper.  He really, he really was.  This is the setup.  Uh, so enjoy with us as we celebrate the beginning of the end, the last appearance of Tippy Tom on the Opie and Anthony show on The Man, The Stench, The Legend, a tribute to Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom, The Man, The Stench, The Legend.  He's showing up, yeah?  Stop it! 
[03:33:30]  Get ready to listen to this roar.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show!  We've got a huge crowd today here at FM Satellite Radio.  What the fuck can happen?  We've got Dr. Steve over there with his entourage.  Yes.  Is that your entourage over there, Dr. Steve?  Dr. Steve has an entourage.  I like that.  This show's more pottery than Howard Sturie.  And, of course, and, of course, he has already begun. 
[03:34:00]  Howard Sturie can't meet this.  Holy shit, he said something intelligent.  Howard Sturie ain't gonna win!  Tippy Tom, everyone.  Let's hear it for Tippy Tom!  There are people on the bleachers wearing surgical masks.  Yeah.  Uh, and other kind of protective gear.  One guy has a shirt pulled over his nose.  Yeah, there's surgical masks and people just putting their teeth...  I heard you in Mexico!  Hey, get a mic on, Tippy Tom!  I heard you in Mexico, he says.  Who was in Mexico, Tom?  Tippy.  Who was in Mexico? 
[03:34:30]  Who was in Mexico?  What should I say?  Who was in Mexico?  Well, uh, well, a guy named Tippy Tom was in Mexico.  Um, let's see, who else is in Mexico?  Well, I think Opie and Anthony might be there.  Uh, but they're here in New York now.  I think.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Hey, Sam, I gotta ask the guys behind, how bad does Tippy Tom smell?  Oh, my God!  It really is bad, because I walked in and I was amazed by how many people were here for 
[03:35:00]  the show today, and then all of a sudden I didn't see Tippy Tom, but I smelled them.  That's how bad...  Tom!  Oh, my God!  Tom.  Tom, you stink!  You stink.  Well, nobody smells that good, and so, you know, but I rule.  But I rule!  That's right, I use root!  Hold on.  Give them a...  All right, Travis.  The funny thing about working for the show is that Danny and I both don't think he smells 
[03:35:30]  that bad today, but, like, just what we've known, as opposed to the audience.  You're right.  No.  He doesn't smell as bad today as he has.  As soon as you walk in, you smell them, though, man.  But there have been...  The last time he was in had to be the funkiest he ever was.  Well, Tippy, I heard Tippy say to somebody outside that he doesn't smell that bad because  he just took a bath three weeks ago.  Yeah, three weeks ago, and he uses brute!  See, you guys don't get it because he, uh...  You're not in close quarters with him.  When I bring him here in a car, it's horrendous. 
[03:36:00]  Because you can't...  You have to have all the windows open and your head out the window.  Do you use your own personal car?  No, no, no, no.  Except for the one time I was returning Ange's lease, and I did put him in the back of the  car because that leasing company was scumbag.  So I put him in the back on the way.  You should have left him in there when you turn in the car.  Yeah.  Hey, what am I doing here?  Look at these guys.  They're just plugging up their, uh, noses, man.  You guys want Tippy Tom to leave the area?  Uh, please.  Tom's got a whole bench to himself, too. 
[03:36:30]  I gotta tell you, yeah, Anthony has the observation.  There's easily 40, 50 people out there, and the bleachers are packed.  There's a ton of people standing in the back.  No one will sit on the front of the bleachers at the top.  Or in the second row, even.  Yep.  You know where you should sit, Tom?  Maybe there's a little office in the back there where you could sit, Tom, for a little  while.  Because Ron and Fez like Tom.  I think you should bring Tom to the Ron and Fez office.  No, no, it's okay.  I'm smelling him now.  We're gonna have Tippy Tom change his clothes in Ron and Fez's office. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And he can leave his clothes in there.  That's how much we like those guys, you know?  Can you buy me a beer?  Yeah, get him a beer.  Can you buy me a beer?  What is this, a bar?  It's Friday, Tom, right?  Don't forget your food, Tom.  Hey, Sam.  Sam.  Have Tom do a circle around the bleachers for everybody.  Yes.  It's a photo op for everybody.  Because a lot of people bring cameras to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Photo op.  Photo op.  Walk through the crowd, Tom. 
[03:37:30]  Walk through the crowd.  Walk through the crowd.  Over here?  No, walk through the crowd.  Walk around this way.  I want to talk on the radio.  Wait, walk around.  Take the mic.  Go that way.  Go that way.  Sam, follow him with the mic, and then he'll follow you.  Yep.  All right.  Oof.  Oh, he's walking.  There he goes.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's walking through the crowd.  Oh, the crowd's horrified.  It looks like they're running with the bulls in Spain.  The way they play with the mic. 
[03:38:00]  Where's he going?  He's just wandering around.  Sam, what's going on?  That's Willy Wonka.  People are taking off their shirts and fanning the air toward Tom.  Tibby insisted that you guys wanted him to sing a song, and then I wanted him to sing a song.  So he's serenading me with some of the tunes from Willy Wonka.  All right.  Let's hear a song there, Tom.  Let's go.  I like Willy Wonka.  Let's hear a song, Tom.  He's my favorite. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  Willy Wonka and the Trollery Factory.  Come with me, and you'll be in a world of your imagination.  Take a look at a book, and you'll be in your imagination.  Your imagination.  Simply do it.  It's killing it.  Well, that changes the world.  There's nothing to it.  Yeah!  That's it! 
[03:39:00]  That's Willy Wonka!  Yeah.  And the Chocolate Factory is his underwear.  He's doing this all with dignity as his fly is undone.  Oh, really?  Oh, we just got breaking news.  Cream Pie Jones will also take fingers up his ass from Dr. Steve.  They're lighting up today for their exams.  Where's Cream Pie Jones?  Yeah, he freaked out the other day when the...  He just said he's on a run. 
[03:39:30]  When the porn star...  Oh, he's on a run?  Porn star wanted to give him a blowjob.  Yeah.  Allegedly.  And he, well, he freaked out.  But he's okay with me doing my...  Yeah, apparently so.  Well, that's a little odd, isn't it?  That's a little odd.  Hog out the whole studio, you motherfucker!  But, Tom, our names are on the billboard.  I'm sorry.  He's like...  He's talking about us. 
[03:40:00]  Tom!  Well, anyway, thank you for the beer!  You're welcome.  Tom, can you hear us?  Bring Tom in.  Bring him over there.  Yeah!  Oh, the crowd loves that.  I'll cheer.  Well, they're cheering because then, you know, they can get some fresh air.  Ladies and gentlemen, Tippi Tom has made his way into the studio.  No, over there!  Tom!  You gotta sit over there.  It's way over there.  It's over here.  Yeah, over there.  Holy shit.  Hey, Tom, were you in West Virginia working in the mines?  What's the most...  What the fuck, Tom? 
[03:40:30]  He's not as bad as usual.  Tom, what have you been up to since the last time we saw you?  Well, what I've been doing is making millions of dollars.  Yeah.  And, um, I forgot where I put it.  Yeah.  I buried my money.  Yeah.  And so I gotta go looking for it.  Yeah.  And so I can come out with some more money.  Yeah.  So I buried cans and stuff like that, and blah, blah, blah, blah, gold.  Yeah.  He probably does.  And so what I gotta do is I got to go find where I put it. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Hey, are you still wearing the underpants we gave you the last time?  Excuse me?  I can't hear you, sir.  Are you still wearing the underpants that we gave you?  Oh, that you gave me here?  The last time we saw you, we cut your underpants off and there was like a shit brick in there.  And you got another new...  That was last time.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I got new ones.  Tom's dressing stylish.  I went to the Stylacian Army and they gave me brand new pants because I wore the ones 
[03:41:30]  out that they gave me.  He's looking very stylish.  Who did you kill for those clothes?  You need a belt, huh?  Who did I kill?  Tom, you need a belt, don't you?  Are you holding your pants up?  I'm holding them up right now.  What do you think?  Are they too big for you?  No.  What's the matter?  Those golden buns won't hold your pants up?  The golden buns get skinny.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, and you'll keep getting skinnier.  Why are you getting skinny there, Tom?  No more hiney.  They call me flat ass. 
[03:42:00]  I don't recall that because I had the golden buns.  Yeah.  And that's why I wanted to be known as...  Hey, has the crowd seen Tippi Tom's ass yet?  Do you guys want to see golden buns?  Yeah, it looks like they said yes.  Timmy, are they saying yes out there?  Yeah, they want to see.  Yeah, I think that...  Tom, go back outside there, Tom.  They're cheering for Tom. 
[03:42:30]  They're cheering for Tom.  They're cheering for Tom.  Wow.  Wow.  That's so proud.  This person loves Tom.  And there's...  And there's golden buns.  Oh, he's got a whiff.  Yeah, he's stinking.  Oh, my God.  I just need to do it.  Oh, I just got a whiff.  Yeah.  Because my golden buns are getting small.  Hey, Sam, talk to the crowd.  Anybody want...  Anyone have a comment about golden buns there?  What did you guys think of golden buns? 
[03:43:00]  Horrible.  What did you think of golden buns?  Those colored veins.  He's got the skeleton already.  Who's the original golden buns?  Me.  I'm the original golden buns.  I'm gold bun granddaddy.  I am the best.  Holy crap, is that the worst smell?  There's other fake golden buns out there.  Oh, God.  It's awful.  Not the real golden buns.  Hey, Danny, grab his mic and show everybody the real golden buns, please.  Sorry, Tippy.  We got the real golden buns in studio. 
[03:43:30]  I'm your original golden buns.  You're just a deposit.  Get all these fake Tippy towns running around.  I'm your original golden buns.  Hold it.  Let me show you my original golden buns, everybody.  That's my original golden bun.  Danny showed his ass.  That's your original golden bun.  God, that smell.  Danny has a fat little rump.  Competition.  Okay.  Competition.  We got a little competition.  Yeah.  Hey, where's Cream Pie Jones?  Yeah, but can you shake them buns like me?  You can't shake. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Shake them buns.  Come on, shake with me.  Where's the Cream Pie Jones?  We got to talk to you.  You might still be out right now.  Oh, all right.  Tom's sweatshirt has dollar symbols and a big portrait of Benjamin Franklin from the $100  bill.  That's a bad day for me.  We also have Brie Olsen stopping by, the porn star.  She was in once.  Yeah, where is she?  Is she here yet?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Okay.  Oh.  I hate to bail, but I got a fucking plane. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, boy.  Sucks on a day like this.  Huh?  I'll bleep this.  You just got here?  Oh, wow.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice big audience.  Tippi Tom stench.  Boy, this sucks.  And I have to go down to the Bahamas and drink banana rum drinks.  Yeah, that really sucks.  By a pool.  We get to stay with Tippi Tom while you fucking hobnob with Nicolini in a bikini.  It sucks to be you. 
[03:45:00]  Thank you.  I can't remember from you.  I take on the best ass in his home.  All right.  Well, I'll leave it in your capable hands, boys.  I'll be listening.  I'm sure it's going to be entertaining radio with this crazy motherfucker out there as he  just keeps drinking.  I got the best ass.  No, I'm not saying you have a bad ass.  I'm just saying that you are not Golden Buns.  I am Golden Buns.  And I am the best.  Was anyone disputing his title as Golden Buns? 
[03:45:30]  It's like there's people clamoring to be Golden Buns.  No, no, sir.  I'm Golden Buns.  No one's arguing.  Oh, no, we are not a Golden Buns.  No one's arguing.  The Golden Bun Party.  Wait a minute.  The Golden Bun Party.  No.  He thinks everyone's here for him.  No.  He thinks.  Oh, why don't we?  All right.  Hey, Tom, everyone showed up for you today, buddy.  Everyone's here for you.  Everyone's here for you.  Well, go Golden Buns. 
[03:46:00]  They want to see Golden Buns.  No, no, no.  Golden Buns.  No, no, no.  Don't forget.  All right, gentlemen.  I'll be in touch.  All right, buddy.  Have a safe trip.  Take care.  Have a safe flight.  Thank you to the Bahamas.  Bye.  Hold this, please.  Up against the window.  Yeah.  Strong new shirt.  Oh, yeah.  All right. 
[03:46:30]  I want to dance.  You want to dance, Tom?  Stand back.  You and give me this.  The Jimmy Tom step.  All right.  Come on.  Get some music going.  What song you want, Tom?  It goes like this.  We're going to go to...  What is he doing?  I don't know.  The shit shuffle.  He's, uh...  It's the Jimmy Tom step.  Two.  Arrest that man.  Tom, what happened? 
[03:47:00]  What do you want arrested?  Arrest him.  Why do you want him arrested?  Arrest him right now.  Put the cuff on him.  Come on.  Why?  Get over here and cuff him.  Why?  Why do you want to arrest Sam?  Well, because he insulted me.  What did he say?  It hurt my feelings, man.  What did I do?  What did he say?  You said my golden buns weren't golden.  I'm in third place.  I did not know that.  You're in third place.  Oh, I know.  All right.  Get back out there.  Hang with the listeners.  They're here for you, Tom. 
[03:47:30]  Tom is charming today.  He's a whimsical, charming man when he's only been drinking for four hours.  Yeah.  He's still relatively sober.  Jackass.  Jackass.  Yes.  Yes.  Wait, what happened, Tom?  Tom keeps opening the door and screaming.  It's like the fact that Sam doesn't want to do his story.  He's telling Sam to get a haircut.  You tell Officer that he got a bad haircut.  Yeah.  He looks like a freak. 
[03:48:00]  Sammy doesn't like your hair.  No, it's Keith's hair.  He doesn't like Keith's hair.  You don't like Sam's hair?  If you can't catch me, guy, I run faster than you.  Oh, that's a threat there, Keith.  He doesn't think you could, you know, catch him.  My name is Tippi Tom.  Back to Tippi.  Hold on a second.  What I'm saying is I'm having a good time.  How did he find a mic, Sam?  He don't work for the show.  What I'm saying is that I'm having a good time, and you tell Keith that I will not deal  with him with his bad behavior. 
[03:48:30]  Okay?  That's right.  It's Keith's job to find Tippi Tom.  He was a juvenile delinquent, and now he's grown up a little bit, but he's still, he was  a bad boy, and he's a good guy now, though.  But still.  Hey, Tom.  But he's over weight.  He's got to lose 10 pounds.  You're saying Keith's overweight.  10 pounds.  They just told Steve he also needed to lose 10 pounds. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, that's generous.  Yeah, that's generous.  Who's that, Opie?  Yeah.  What are you doing over there, Opie?  I'm trying to, like, fucking control the festivities here today.  Just sitting around?  This is what I want you to do.  We want to give you the best seat in the house.  Sam, give him the middle of the bleachers, please.  Yes, the middle of the bleachers for Tippi Tom.  Make way for Tippi Tom.  Move over.  Tippi Tom is going to sit down and enjoy the show.  Up top there, Sam, on the second, maybe third row for Tippi Tom. 
[03:49:30]  Right in the dead middle.  You're running the show, Tippi.  There you go.  Sit down.  All right.  They're not happy.  He's hogging on the street.  How does he smell?  Oh, terrible.  Tippi Tom, the man, the stench, the legend.  I see dead.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197, XM202.  It's the man, the stench, the legend, Tippi Tom.  What can you say? 
[03:50:00]  He's dead, but this is a tribute.  That's a terrible thing to say.  On the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm Iraq, primetime Sam Roberts, and Danny, also from the Opie and Anthony show.  And Danny, I mean, you and I love Tippi Tom.  Without a doubt.  More than Eric.  I got to point out that in this, no, I like him, but nowhere to the level that you two do.  Yeah.  But I got to also point out that during this segment that we're about to talk about, this  is when you got your photo with Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  Well, here's the thing.  Tippi Tom, because of what I do for the show, I, especially towards the end of his appearances, 
[03:50:30]  I always ended up being his handler.  And I was his handler on this day, and there was no, I mean, it was just so much fun to  just be able to follow him around with a microphone.  I didn't need to feed it.  Like, I always need to feed people things when I'm handling them.  And I never needed to feed him.  I just, sometimes I would have to take the mic away.  But never was there a lack of content from Tippi. 
[03:51:00]  And you got to pick with Tippi, right?  Before.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sam used to go around because he was envious of the photos that you had.  And he's like, I got to get one with Tom.  I got to get one with Tom.  So we made sure he did.  And who knew that if you didn't do it now, you'd never have one.  I'm glad I got mine.  It's funny, because I was over at Travis.  I know this is kind of tangency, too.  But I was over at Travis's house, and he's got, like, all these pictures and a nice frame.  And I was like, you know, I don't have anything like that.  So for my birthday, they got me, him and his wife got me a frame.  And they put all, like, some celebrity photos, you know, in, like, it's like a multi-eighth thing frame. 
[03:51:30]  And one of the pictures that they threw in there was Tippi Tom.  Not, like, as a joke, but they said, we put the picture of you in Tippi Tom because we know, like, he's just as important to you as all these different celebrities.  Like, George Romero and, you know, the Mythbusters.  And Tippi Tom, for me, was right up there.  And I'm glad I got my pick.  It hangs proudly on my wall.  It really is true.  I mean, I get a bunch of celebrity pictures just because I like them.  And I really don't frame them very often.  But now that Tippi Tom is gone and this is it, that's one of the few. 
[03:52:00]  I frame my Rob Zombie picture, my Hulk Hogan picture, and I will frame, you know, blow up the Tippi Tom picture to the 8x10.  But we kind of give this a long intro because this is his last bit on the Opie and Anthony show.  And one of the best.  Hard to believe, too.  Like, I remember even Opie was kind of surprised.  He was like, nah, we're missing an appearance.  And, you know, no, this was it.  When Tippi Tom got his prostate exam, that was the last time we had ever seen the man.  And, I mean, really, knowing Tippi Tom, this is the way he would have liked to have gone out with a finger up the ass. 
[03:52:30]  To be perfectly honest, probably his all-time, was it his all-time best?  I mean, he was on fucking fire.  He had line of the day this day.  He did.  He was on fire all day.  Yeah.  All day long, man, especially this bit.  This is the day he came in with a famous Stars and Straps, like, hip-hop hoodie on with, like, Benjamin Franklin's face on it.  And he's homeless.  He has no money.  Well, he has nothing anymore.  But this is...  And this is back at the old studio. 
[03:53:00]  And I remember he was sitting on the bleachers with all the other...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to go outside with him and just watch as people recoiled.  I mean, it was amazing.  This is maybe his best appearance.  It's his prostate exam.  His final appearance.  Yeah.  On the O.V. and Anthony show, it's the man, the stench, the legend, a tribute to Tippi Tom.  I love you, Tom.  Tippi Tom.  The man, the stench, the legend.  All right.  All right.  Tippi Tom, I'll talk.  All right.  Tippi, yeah.  I'm going to sit down now.  Tippi. 
[03:53:30]  I guess on the...  Why are the doctors putting on all sorts of fucking biohazard gear?  I know.  Do you have a question for me, please?  Hold on.  Yeah.  When was the last time you saw a doctor, Tippi Tom?  About a thousand years ago, when I was growing up.  Yeah.  And then, but that was about it.  Yeah.  I'm going to go to doctors and I don't like them.  Yeah.  Because they'll find out things that are wrong with you that aren't.  Tom, I got to ask you something.  So I'm really not happy with doctors. 
[03:54:00]  Have you been drooling for oil?  How much oil do I drink?  No.  Have you been drooling for oil?  You have fucking hands like Daniel Day-Lewis.  Oh, I do that all the time.  Yeah.  So what else do you want to hear?  Tippi Tom, the doctor is going to examine you now, so you have to take your clothes off.  Yeah.  Oh, see my body?  Yeah.  You got to take your clothes off.  So again, take your clothes off.  Well...  Step out in front of the crowd.  That's going to cost them some money.  Well, they're right over here. 
[03:54:30]  They're going to cost...  No, they said no.  No, no.  They didn't even know.  Go ahead.  You want some money?  Get your hands off.  Well, yeah.  No, I'm on our radio.  Right here.  This is the...  Oh, I'm watching you.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the charity portion of the O.P. Anthony show, where we  pass around a basket like we're in church.  What do you want to do?  Give.  Give to the homeless.  Give me to take my clothes off.  Yeah, be sexy.  Take your clothes off and throw them like a stripper.  Wait a second.  Take it like we're out of here. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, it gets crazy.  All right, take your clothes off, Tom, for your exam.  Take your clothes off.  Throw your money, ladies and gentlemen.  Throw your money.  I'm not taking all my clothes off.  You've got to take it off for your exam.  Get your pants.  Well, where's the doctor at?  He's right there.  That's the doctor.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  Come on.  You're just...  All right.  What are we doing?  We're standing here.  Dr. Steve's keeping it here.  Dr. Steve's keeping it very professional.  He said, Tom doesn't have to take all his clothes off.  Get your hog away from me. 
[03:55:30]  How is his penis next day?  Jimmy was...  Don't sprinkle them by me, E-Rock.  Jimmy was three feet from Jimmy's penis.  All right.  Get over here.  Tom, we're going to...  Yeah, I'm getting over here.  Tom, we're going to examine you.  Dr. Steve is a real doctor.  Yeah.  Tom and I talked before the show.  Yeah.  All right.  And he's cool with doing this on the air.  Am I sitting down or standing up?  We'll let you stand up.  You got to take your jacket off the time. 
[03:56:00]  Take Anthony's chair.  Jimmy's standing up right now.  All right.  Because I'm going to get an exam.  Yes.  To see if I'm okay.  He hasn't been to the doctor in a long time, and we've arranged for someone at the Ryan Center  uptown to see him after the show if we find anything.  Okay.  Yeah, because, you know, my pancreas has given out.  Not your liver?  Let's see.  Something else is breaking down.  And plus, I stubbed my toe.  And that's what bothers me the most. 
[03:56:30]  So, can you fix the toe?  Sure.  Absolutely.  Let's see your feet, Tom.  Yeah, let's see them.  By the way, who's working the pal talk cameras?  No, they stink the place up.  No one's working the pal talk cameras.  The thing is, I got my new socks on.  Yeah.  Yeah, Dad, you know how to do that?  And I have to keep them on.  My doctor told me, because I stubbed my toe.  All right, Dr. Steve is listening to his heart.  Steve, you got to give us commentary, honestly.  Okay, I'm just listening to his heart, and it actually sounds pretty darn good. 
[03:57:00]  You can take us working, huh?  Yep.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  Take a deep breath for me.  Take a deep breath.  Oh, boy.  Emphysema for everyone.  Occasionally.  I mostly smoke other things.  I'm just going to feel it.  I smoke corn silk.  Corn silk? 
[03:57:30]  How is his lungs?  How is his lungs?  He's got it in a cornfield in Jersey.  Where do you think you're going to get it at?  All right.  They got it in Long Island, too.  Steve?  Okay.  Now, Tom, you know your liver's a little enlarged.  I think my liver is a little enlarged.  Oh, that's not enough.  Can I see your ankle?  What you're feeling, Steve, is the help me sign.  The liver's holding up.  Oh, ankle no good.  Ankle no good. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, this is where it gets serious.  Well, this one's not too bad.  Oh, Tom.  No, this one's worse.  Yeah, Dr. Steve is looking at tippy-tom's ankles.  They're not too bad.  I can still walk.  Yeah.  So, obviously, everything's...  Have they been swollen like that for a long time?  Dr. Steve's been happy.  Well, they go up and down, you know.  Yeah.  You know, some days up, some days down.  Dr. Steve, it's been about a year that I've seen it like that.  Do you get shorter breaths when you lay down? 
[03:58:30]  No.  Okay.  All right.  What do you think that means, this ankle?  When you have big ankles, it can be from a lot of things, but it's always fluid, and  it's just the question is where...  Edema?  Edema.  Edema, I mean?  Yeah, where is the fluid coming from?  Now, in his case, what this really looks like is a thing called venous stasis, which is  just, it's from gravity pulling on the veins in the legs. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, gravity!  And then fluid...  I did not know that!  And fluid...  Now I know it.  Fluid leaks out from the veins, and we'll talk about that after the show, but if you elevate  your legs when you're laying down, that'll actually help that.  That is true.  Yes.  Elevate them.  That's what I do!  Yep.  Oh, good.  Yeah, but I lay on concrete.  It holds my back, too, because I got a bad back.  Okay.  So I lay on a flat surface and elevate my dukes, my feet, and that way the blood circulation 
[03:59:30]  runs right, because when I wake up, if I go to sleep, if I'm lucky, then I wake up,  or get up when I'm done laying down, so I can walk.  You spend most of the day on your feet?  Because I like to walk around town.  Yeah!  Now, the thing that I'd like to do next is what we talked about earlier, is to check  your prostate and check your rear end...  My prostate, Glenn? 
[04:00:00]  Yep.  Well, that might be a job.  Well, that might be a job.  Do you want to go up my ass?  Yeah.  What we'll do is we'll have you drop your drawers, and I'll have you bend over the table, and  we'll bring up a...  Right here?  Yep, and we'll bring up a sheet so that nobody can see you.  So something...  A camera?  No, and I'll just use my finger, and we'll just test you for blood, and we'll check out  your prostate gland.  Check the, uh...  So you can put the finger up your ass, right?  Yeah.  Is that okay?  Yeah. 
[04:00:30]  Will you rotate it a little bit?  Yeah.  I want to enjoy this stuff!  You're going to be free!  See, just let the material be funny.  I don't have to try to be funny.  That's fucking great.  Will you rotate it?  Well, if you can put a finger up my ass, I want it to feel good.  Yeah, that's the way it is.  All right.  Let's get the sheet off.  All right.  All right.  Let's get the sheet off.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  If it don't feel good, I'll be mad. 
[04:01:00]  Mm-hmm.  You okay with doing this?  Well, when are we going to do this job?  Right now.  Where?  Right here?  Yep.  In front of everybody?  Yep.  They'll bring the sheet up.  Right here?  The sheet's up.  No one can see you, except us.  The figure's going in the ass!  If it's okay with you...  In front of everybody?  There's only a matter of time.  Yeah, just...  Wow!  You were just naked!  We're in front of everybody.  Yeah.  And he checks you.  Yeah.  That's all.  It's a quickie. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, but suppose they like my ass.  I'm golden buns.  And they might like me.  That's why we gotta check out.  Golden buns don't...  Don't...  I have too many people on me.  We're checking out...  And I can only handle a few at a time.  Yeah.  We're checking out golden buns for you.  It'll just be me.  Yeah.  And this is my partner, PA John, who you've met before.  Oh, another doctor.  Yes, sir.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Good!  I've got two doctors.  That's right.  And I'm happy.  You ready?  All right, Tom.  How are we gonna do this?  You just drop your drawers?  And bend over the table.  Just kind of touch your ankle. 
[04:02:00]  Just kind of bend over?  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Hey, there's a whole life.  Alright.

[04:11:00]  XM 202.  Tippi Tom.  The man.  The stench.  The legend.  The legend.  Continues.  Only on the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  This is the man.  The stench.  The legend.  A tribute to Tippi Tom on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Primetime Sam Roberts, E-Rock, and Danny are here.  Danny, why don't you send them off?  Oh!  Tippi, we love you.  There's people down here thinking about you.  You will be missed.  You will be missed. 
[04:11:30]  And for a lot of homeless gentlemen out there, they can't say that.  Yeah.  They really just, unfortunately, just die cold and alone.  And at least you went out with people really, really giving a shit about you, Tippi.  I hope somewhere he realizes the difference that he actually made.  That he is, you know, he has a whole show about him.  Like, they're, like, as many listeners as we have now, I put on my Facebook, RIP Tippi Tom.  And I got people messaging me, no, not Tippi Tom.  I talked to people who haven't listened to the show in years, who don't even have satellite radio, who I said, yeah, we're doing a show for Tippi Tom. 
[04:12:00]  And they go, oh, why?  They know who he is.  And they're like, no, Tippi Tom died.  And I mean, the difference that he made, especially for a homeless man.  Yeah.  I mean, and you guys know me, personally.  I mean, we've all worked together for about four years.  I don't get emotional.  I'm not an emotional kind of guy when it comes to, like, you know, sensitive things.  But when Keith told me that Tippi was gone, I mean, I had to ask him.  I literally asked him, like, five times over the course of 20 minutes because I didn't know if he was being serious. 
[04:12:30]  And I'm like, so I was like, you're fucking around, right?  And he's like, no, Tippi's dead.  I'm like, no.  Are you serious, Tippi?  There has to be a mistake.  Because there were scares before.  Yeah, where he's disappeared for a few months or whatever.  But then once it's kind of sunk in, like, no, Tippi Tom is actually dead, I teared up and I cried.  You sure?  I was very upset about this.  Way more upset than any of the recent celebrity deaths that have been in the news.  I could give a shit.  Tippi Tom is definitely the one to put me over the edge.  Do you want to explain about some of the news coverage that Tippi Tom's death got? 
[04:13:00]  Dude, that was the best.  I had so much fun that day.  I mean, even though it was a very sad day, but it was a lot of fun to Google bomb just three words, Tippi Tom died,  and get it to the top of the Google Trends.  And then the story was getting picked up.  People wanted to know, who is Tippi Tom?  Is he dead?  And why is he at the very top of Google Trends all day long?  That was from the morning until I think it didn't even fall off until about four or five in the afternoon Eastern time.  I mean, he hit Gawker.  He hit Fox News dot com. 
[04:13:30]  He hit all these.  Tippi fucking Tom made Fox News dot com.  That's awesome.  And Gawker's a huge site.  And it made international press.  There was there.  You know, there was not only bloggers, but I guess what I could imagine are reputable news organizations.  You know, it was a site in India that had exactly it's in India.  So who the fuck knows?  But I mean, just the fact that they're picking up on Tippi Tom.  And there was at least seven about six or seven individual separate articles that were mentioning Tippi Tom and questioning who he was and who this guy was.  It was it was great to see him kind of immortalized like that was just awesome. 
[04:14:00]  You know, worldwide fame for a day.  It sucks that he had to be dead for it, but worldwide fame for a lifetime.  It was a good way to go.  I thought it was a really cool way to go out.  And the last part, a little behind the scenes look that nobody knows about except us three here.  I believe this was Danny's idea, but we've been having meetings for the last month or so about this bit that we wanted to do that would center around Tippi Tom.  Do you want to explain that?  Yeah.  And now that we'll never be able to do it.  Yeah.  We wanted to have a wine tasting. 
[04:14:30]  And I have Tippi Tom as the guest of honor and have a Tippi Tom wine tasting day where he would we'd get shit wine, get Boone's Farm wine.  And we get like hundred dollar bottles of, you know, of a nice Charles, perhaps like the dead arm or something really good.  And have give Tippi the wine and have him, you know, he won't know what wine he's tasting.  He just has to elaborate on on.  I mean, obviously, if you've listened to the special, you know, Tippi could only articulate in in his Tippi Tom way.  And it would have been fantastic.  And unfortunately, we won't be able to give that to you guys. 
[04:15:00]  But it was definitely in the works.  And I'll tell you something.  There was there was so much talk about it behind the scenes.  I think it kind of hits us guys a little harder than maybe it would have six months ago, just simply because we were all so very excited to have Tippi back.  I was I called Keith.  I texted Keith and I said, Keith, I got to get with you because I'm going to go down on the street and talk to homeless people and see if we can find Tippi Tom.  Ask them, where's Tippi Tom?  Because he hasn't been around in a while.  And that's when Keith called me and said, dude, I got to tell you something. 
[04:15:30]  And it's like, you know, and that's why it was like we we miss him.  And I'm sure you all do, too.  Yes. And with all that said, we now bid our final farewell to the legend, the one and only Tippi Tom.  Thank you for joining us.  And I think to myself.  What a wonderful moon.  Yes.  I think to myself. 
[04:16:00]  What a wonderful moon.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, B and Anthony.  Stay there.  Anybody got a beer?  Yeah, we got.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.
