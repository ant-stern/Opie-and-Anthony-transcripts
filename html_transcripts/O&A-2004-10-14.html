<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts repeatedly declaring "Rock is dead" and chanting "Long live Rob," before transitioning into a discussion of their move to XM Satellite Radio and their rivalry with Sirius and Howard Stern.  A significant portion focused on the Yankees/Red Sox rivalry, featuring vulgar commentary on the Red Sox's performance and Curt Schilling's injury, along with speculation about a Red Sox "curse."  A listener named Paco called in with an angry, largely unintelligible rant against Clear Channel.  The show included a pre-recorded "Babe Ruth from Hell" bit filled with crude humor and profanity, followed by a discussion of a recently discovered mob burial site in New York.  A call with a newspaper subscription representative devolved into a comedically inept interaction.  Further segments covered news stories about breast implants in Shanghai and the hosts' experiences with escorts, with Jim Norton detailing a positive experience with an escort from NYconfidential.com in graphic detail, including descriptions of the encounter's location, activities, and the woman's demeanor. This segment included tangents about STIs, Norton's anxieties about testing, sexually suggestive comments from callers, a listener's discovery of pornography in a children's movie, the presidential debates, and sports commentary.

The show then delved into the Bill O'Reilly sexual harassment lawsuit, reading excerpts from the lawsuit detailing graphic allegations and speculating on the consequences.  Humorous anecdotes about a "wild" producer from *The O'Reilly Factor*, including a Hooters beer fight, a photo incident involving genitalia and a tampon string, and the hosts' delayed realization she had a prosthetic arm, were recounted.  A caller named Tia participated in a sexually suggestive game called "Guess What's in Your Pants." The hosts also briefly discussed a letter from Kobe Bryant's accuser and mentioned a New York Times reporter and Stephen Lynch as being in the studio.

A segment focused on an attempt to listen in on a Tennessee couple having sex, featuring crude jokes about penis size and sexual acts, punctuated by technical difficulties with squeaky microphones.  Comedian Stephen Lynch joined the show in the studio, performing several songs, including one about his preference for Black women and a raunchy song about "Craig Christ."  Lynch discussed his past appearances, current projects, and past experiences performing in subpar venues, along with his observations about the hosts' new studio.  A trucker named Jessica called in, sharing that she listened to the Tennessee couple and masturbated during the segment.  The hosts discussed their new radio setup (lacking amenities like a Jäger machine and foosball table), their experiences after being fired from their previous job, a listener complaint about signal reception, and a controversial 9/11 commemorative coin, with Opie recounting angrily destroying a display selling 9/11 merchandise at Ground Zero.  The show concluded with more of Lynch's performances and discussion of his career and touring with Mitch Hedberg, including rumors about Hedberg's health.

A further segment included a caller, Tad, discussing the origin of commemorative coins allegedly made from Ground Zero silver.  This transitioned into a discussion about Elizabeth Taylor's alleged possession of Nazi-looted art. Stephen Lynch performed songs including "Kill a Kitten" and "Special Ed," both with highly offensive and explicit lyrics.  The hosts engaged in crude banter, referencing interactions with female guests, including an escort.  They also discussed negative reactions to a Christina Aguilera commercial.  Various callers contributed to the offensive and humorous nature of the broadcast, including one recounting an underwater fight with a Frenchman, another discussing a positive reaction to a previous "dildo trick" segment, and one describing a political flyer depicting George W. Bush's head on a Special Olympian's body.  A Jägermeister advertisement promised a tap machine for the show. The segment concluded with listener call-ins summarizing their takeaways and further off-color jokes and banter from Opie and Anthony, along with a mention of upcoming guests.

[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Affinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made.  Police are still investigating.  Hold it! Hold it!  Let's do it!  The blonde one, uh, some so-called radio shock jocks. 
[00:06:00]  Our society needs borders.  It needs parameters.  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Shot.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural  degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock, rock, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits. 
[00:06:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  I love the smell of they come in the morning.  Damn straight!  Smells like...  Victory!  Ah, yes.  Smells like victory.  Smells like...  Smells like morning.  It is morning.  Do it!  Yes.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Better known as the O.N.A. Virus.  Are you infected yet?  Are you?  Are you chafing? 
[00:07:00]  A big hi to everybody.  You can turn down the music a little bit, Steve.  Jesus.  Thank you.  A big hi to everybody that turned on their XM satellite radios overnight.  Welcome to the family.  You made the right choice.  You're listening to the best satellite radio company in the world.  Trust me on that.  Trust me on that.  XM satellite radio is where it's at, baby. 
[00:07:30]  It's the place to be.  Other people think another satellite radio company is where it's at.  Wrong!  Make it seem like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  Isn't this great?  Love it.  Leave satellite radio to the kids.  We know what we're doing with this toy.  Trust me on that one.  Right, Anthony? 
[00:08:00]  Absolutery.  Except for the squeaky mics.  Well, the squeaky mics can be worked on.  Oh, we got a busy show.  You know what I say to Sirius?  Who's your daddy?  Oh, my God.  Who's your daddy?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, slow down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Play with my boys.  Play with my boys.  Oh, that feels so good. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, just roll them around in a circle.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  We do.  Uh-oh.  Slow down.  Ow!  Don't move.  I will get you a towel.  Yes.  You know what I have to say to other Sox fans today?  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Ow. 
[00:09:00]  That was a tough one.  Yeah, yeah.  Tough one.  Ben, not even looking up.  Ben, our resident Red Sox fan, a little, uh, you're feeling a little badly, I think, right?  What's that?  It's over.  You think it's over?  It's all about the Patriots.  Let's just look forward to the Patriots season.  Oh, he's already abandoning home.  A typical Boston, uh, sports fan, right there.  Oh, what a shame.  We'll talk about that a little later.  Uh, yeah, well.  Who's your daddy?  Boy, the chance last night for Pedro. 
[00:09:30]  Ugh.  Unbelievable.  Who's your daddy?  You can't say anything in the press.  Any little catchphrase, any words, any, you will just have 50,000 fans at Yankee Stadium  yelling it at you.  So, well, the Yankees beat the Sox again.  It's over.  You think it's over?  It's totally over.  And Schilling's right now, too?  Well, that's why, that's why, what I was going to say.  It's over because, uh, you know, basically the Yankees were supposed to win two at home.  That's what you're supposed to do with, uh, you know, when you're at home. 
[00:10:00]  But now that they're, now that they're, they're talking to the doctors through most of the game  yesterday, trying to explain how they're going to get Curt Schilling on the mound for game four.  Oh, forget it.  I, unless they pull a Steve Austin on him, uh, nothing's happening because they, I was  getting grossed out when they were talking about what's wrong with his, uh, tendon.  Did you know that a shield, there's a sheath that your tendon is in?  Yeah.  Did you know there was a sheath for your tendon?  And his tendon is out of the sheath, so when he would pitch and move his ankle, it was 
[00:10:30]  rubbing against the bone?  It was rubbing against the bone and snapping like a rubber band on the bone.  Ah!  Don't tell me that!  Yeah, it's horrible.  And then they, they had the, the doctor at the press conference in a panic, you see how  he was sweating and almost crying?  Oh, I know.  Because he knows his whole livelihood depends on him trying to figure out how to get Curt  Schilling on the mound for game four.  They're trying to figure it out.  One thing I love is the, uh, the camera angles you get these days in baseball.  They were showing close-ups of his ankle that were, where's the camera? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  From a mile away, they could get a shot of a nostril hair.  They zoom in on the guys in the dugout so close, I don't know, I don't see the point  in that.  Do you have to see every blackhead on a guy's nose as he's, uh, sitting there?  The close-ups are ridiculous.  That new camera angle, the one, uh, the one that they were showing the hitters.  Oh, diamond cam, yeah.  Where is that thing?  I don't, that's what I was trying to figure out, too.  Where the hell is it?  Probably in the grass somewhere.  It's probably in the grass.  Yeah, it's, it's, it's like on, I think it's on the foul line.  And it's, uh, on the baseline. 
[00:11:30]  And it's sticking up out of the ground or something, or under some, I don't know.  I don't even know how they do it.  Fox is amazing with their sports coverage.  They're always trying to come up with something new.  Every year they got a new camera.  Yeah.  You're right about that.  Although I, I, I can't stand when they, uh, put the little advertisements for other  things coming on, because you wonder where the sound's coming from.  You're watching TV, you look away for a second, you hear,  there's a little NASCAR driving on the bottom of your screen.  Watching the ball game.  What the hell?  Or, and, and, and, and they have no, uh, no respect for subtitles or anything else that 
[00:12:00]  might be going on at the bottom of the screen.  A big advertisement comes in, Joe Blow's head comes moving on the side and stops right  on something you gotta read.  They're just taking over the whole screen now.  I know.  An advertisement for his dopey show you want to see is covering the score.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, what the, move that!  Move that.  I'm trying to check out the game.  Fox can't put enough stuff on the screen at one time.  And, uh...  Showing an episode of the Simpsons during the game up in the upper right-hand corner.  Might as well. 
[00:12:30]  And the Cards beat the Astros last night, 10-7.  Oh, people are paying attention to that?  Well, we're a national show, so...  I understand.  You know what's annoying is how long it takes for the game to start.  You know, 8-19, but doesn't it seem like it's forever from 8 to 8-19?  Well, the Red Sox are too busy trying to put men's uniforms over girls' girdles and dresses.  That's why the game is always late.  How do we hide these slips, boys?  Well, the Yankees just shutting down their offense.  It's great.  Yeah.  The Yankees come alive in postseason. 
[00:13:00]  It just happens.  Who was the better team throughout the season?  That's debatable.  That's debatable.  Yankees, they won the division, I'd say.  But when push comes to shove...  When push comes to shove...  I love the cliché.  Something always happens to the Red Sox.  It's amazing.  Are you saying when crunch time and it comes to crunch time?  I mean, it comes down to crunch time, you know?  It's just amazing.  It really is.  They just seem to fall apart in postseason.  There's always something that happens to the Red Sox. 
[00:13:30]  I'm not saying it's over.  Red Sox, always a threat.  Always a threat.  But it's looking grim.  Your team already beat Pedro and Schilling.  I know.  It's so over.  And Schilling can't even pitch it for Game 4.  That's great.  It's so over.  That knuckleballer Wakefield is a force to be reckoned with.  They'll smack that pussy for 30 runs.  Aim the ball properly, stupid.  The knuckleball pitch.  He's awful.  No one from the Yankees smash Schilling in the ankle with a pipe? 
[00:14:00]  Why?  I like the fact that his stupid ankle sheath...  What is that, a dog's dick on the back of your foot, stupid?  Pony up and throw the ball.  He's trying, but it hurts.  Oh, he's not.  How they explain what happens every time he pitches.  Like Anthony said, I was grimacing at home.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's got our hair.  They have Al Leiter in the booth, letting us know about the pitches.  Hell, I call in sick if I got a hangnail or something.  Yeah, and he's pitching with his tendon bouncing on the bone. 
[00:14:30]  Yee-oo.  Yes.  I was at dumb Bob Kelly's place because he's a huge Red Sox fan.  And it's amazing the internal turmoil they go through.  He can't even express the rage.  It's just fucking being a Red Sox fan is better than being a Yankee fan.  No, it's not, stupid.  He thinks that it builds character.  Character.  To root for a bunch of men that lose every year because of a curse.  It doesn't build character.  Do you root for the rapist or the victim?  That curse really is getting to...  It's gotten to them so bad. 
[00:15:00]  Do you hear what they did?  When they bulldozed down one of the Bambino's houses, it was a big thing in Boston.  But it turns out it was one of the Bambino's wife's houses.  It wasn't even his house.  But to try to break this curse, they made a big thing out of it in Boston.  They bulldozed down a house.  One of my idiot friends sent out a mass email like, oh, we've gotten rid of the curse.  This was a couple weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I had the same thing.  What the Red Sox fans got to do is stop talking about the curse.  The curse. 
[00:15:30]  If the Bambino was alive, he'd be saying,  The curse is still enacted.  You will never win.  With his cancer kazoo.  His ravaged larynx from all the cigarette smoke.  You know what?  Infected women.  Bad food.  Hot dogs.  Another hot dog bleed.  You know what I have?  What's that?  I don't even know if it's going to make sense.  I don't even know if it's funny anymore.  What is it?  We're digging up our old bits that we're allowed to play. 
[00:16:00]  Digging up like mobsters in a queen's field.  Yeah.  We got so much cold crap happening in New York these days.  Yeah, the mob field.  It's just a sick place to live, isn't it?  The mob killing field.  Yeah, the mob burial field.  Unbelievable.  Apparently they all got along when it came down to where they were burying their rats.  The mobs, they could agree on one thing.  Where they were planting their 55-gallon drum full of gavones.  Yeah.  How many people have they... 
[00:16:30]  They don't even know how many.  They pulled up a couple already.  Bones.  They're looking for 55-gallon drums.  Found one with a big fucking bandage around his foot.  It's bigger than your fucking head, spider.  Didn't they find Joe Pesci's character from Goodfellas?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They did, right?  Him.  They're looking for the guy that accidentally hit Gotti's kid years ago.  Did they actually find that guy?  They found bones.  They got to do some testing on it.  They found jewelry, watches, and shoes. 
[00:17:00]  Big dopey mob Italian shoes, I'm sure.  Big Gotti, awful sky blue sweatsuits.  I'll get your fucking shine box.  Shine those shoes right back up, right?  Let it be known that...  Keep them here.  Let it be known that Opie is out of the mob discussion.  What?  He is not talking about the mob.  Hey, hey, I'm not getting down on these guys.  They're my brethren.  Anthony's talking about the mob.  They're my brethren.  And Jim Norton's talking about the mob.  I didn't.  I just talked about sweatsuits, not the mob. 
[00:17:30]  Opie's just staring into space, hoping this will end soon.  Don't you worry.  That's right.  Everything's fine.  You all right?  I endorse the mob.  All right.  I love those guys.  You were talking about Babe Ruth?  Yes.  There's an old bit.  You mentioned it, so I grabbed it.  I don't even know if it's funny anymore.  It might be outdated, but do you remember Babe Ruth from Hell?  Babe Ruth from Hell.  Man, this is old.  I have no clue.  This bit could be...  Is it topical?  I really don't know. 
[00:18:00]  We're going to put ourselves out there.  We should have probably listened to this before you came on the air.  But you were mentioning Babe Ruth and the curse and stuff.  Yes.  And there was a bit we did called Babe Ruth from Hell, where we called him in hell.  Might cringe at this, huh?  Well, we could always turn it off if it's really bad.  All right.  I really don't know.  Good.  Keep the mic up.  All right.  We will.  We will.  Yo, Babe!  How you doing?  It's Babe Ruth live from Hell, everyone.  How you doing?  You got any whores there for me? 
[00:18:30]  You all right, Babe?  Yeah.  I'm in hell.  How all right could I be?  They got me coaching a little league game down here.  You're coaching little league in hell?  Little fuckers can't even play.  Or drink.  They're not even interested in whores like I was.  By the time I was six, I was knocking them down left and right. 
[00:19:00]  A bottle of booze in one hand.  And a cigarette in the other.  Wow, damn.  You know, they invented the voice box just for me.  Yes, I know that.  The electric voice box.  It was actually an accident.  What do you mean?  Well, some chick I was with was using a dildo.  And I accidentally went down on her and realized I could talk. 
[00:19:30]  Come on, you little f***.  Hit the ball.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, Bada, hey, Bada, hey, Bada, f*** you.  Hey, Babe, have you seen your pal Lou Gehrig down there in hell?  No, that pussy was a good guy.  He went up to heaven.  He did, huh?  Yeah.  He died of that Lou Gehrig disease, you know.  Yeah.  Jeez, what are the odds of that? 
[00:20:00]  I had a nice egg, you little prick.  Hey, we're going to get together with Billy Martin and Michael Kennedy tonight for happy hour.  Oh, really?  Billy's driving.  Billy's driving.  You should see Michael's face.  It looks like my larynx.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, what's wrong, babe?  Babe.  I just spilled the beer in my voice, Pop. 
[00:20:30]  My wife's going to kill me.  Wait, babe, you're married?  I did say I was in hell, you know.  Babe, babe.  Babe, babe.  Oh, there he goes.  Babe Ruth, everyone.  There it is.  Babe Ruth from hell.  I think I was 12 when that bit was recorded.  Hope he was going through puberty.  Jesus.  When it's time to change.  I couldn't get my voice that high if I tried. 
[00:21:00]  What the F?  The Bambino.  That was all right.  Man, that curse just really does seem to work.  It's been so long, and they just can't pull it together.  Their bats just have stopped working when they really need to be working.  Unbelievable.  All right, so.  I love it, though.  I love it.  I know you love it.  They had a good year.  I mean, they tried hard.  They, you know, played some good games this year.  Sure.  You don't belong in the postseason beyond a certain point. 
[00:21:30]  I'm not trying to be a dick.  You get there, you have a good time, you play a few games, you knock the ball around.  Go home and watch it like everyone else.  All right.  Let's get home with your long, greasy hair.  Let's go to the phones and.  What does Dallas have to do with Boston?  I'm talking football.  Let's talk about football here.  Why?  But we're still playing baseball.  Yeah, we got to get the baseball thing out of the way.  Go Pats.  Although, you know, the Red Sox may as well be playing football.  All right.  The South wants to check in.  It's Paco from Cleveland.  What's up, Paco?  The South. 
[00:22:00]  You said it was the South the other day.  Blind pig when you guys were up here.  What happened?  I gave you all my demo.  What demo?  My radio demo.  Remember?  I remember.  You guys are the reasons I went in the radio.  I remember that.  He gave us the demo.  And I turned around and gave it to Big Kev so he can hold it for me.  And Big Kev lost it.  Yeah.  Bastard.  So you're going to have to send another one, I guess.  Oh, I can email you a copy.  You guys actually really, I realize that, you know, really difficult to let people talk. 
[00:22:30]  You have great communication skills if you want to be on the radio.  Yeah.  You know, because obviously Frank's Place guy is angry because he doesn't get to talk.  So I'm going to try testing the waters this weekend on one of my shows.  See what I can get away with.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:23:00]  Paco.  Oh, yeah.  You're awful.  I know.  I didn't know if you guys were a silent game or not.  You're absolutely awful.  Do you have a backup career?  A backup career?  I don't know.  Computers?  All right.  Well, give us your best bit.  My best bit?  Yeah.  What would you do on a radio show?  Well, this weekend I plan on tearing apart some of the people that screwed me at Clear Channel. 
[00:23:30]  You and who who?  Well, me and...  Yeah, you're right up there with who who.  I'm sure Clear Channel will be very upset at what you have to say about them.  Oh, yeah, but, you know...  They're just going to be enraged.  I've only been in three months.  Give me a break.  No, honestly, yeah, go for it, man.  What are you going to say?  I want to know what he's going to say.  I bet you he's going to be pretty caustic.  Yeah, let's hear it.  All right, what are you going to say?  I'm on an AMOD station.  All right, so you're going to have maybe 100 people listening.  You've got a hell of a lot more listening right now, so what would you say to them? 
[00:24:00]  Go ahead.  What would I say about the people at Clear Channel or going in the radio?  No, you said you had all this great stuff to say.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to trash them.  Let's go.  Oh, yeah.  There's a much bigger audience.  Go.  I'm interning at Clear Channel.  None of these bastards call you back.  There's one dude.  Because you're an intern.  Do the math.  Oh, Jesus.  No, I'm up there like once a week, like at least once a week after I graduated.  Nobody gives me the time of day, and they hire all these other little experts. 
[00:24:30]  Yes, you're an intern.  Whoa, I've got to tell you one thing.  I'd hate to be on the receiving end of this verbal lashing.  Pray God I stay on your good side, son.  Wow, you're really letting them have it over there.  Ease up a little.  Keep going, but just ease up.  Tone it down a bit.  There's one bastard.  Oneski.  No names.  No names.  No names.  We have no idea.  There we go.  Look at that.  I just hit the dump button.  Yeah, we have a dump button.  You can't say names, because we don't know.  I wonder if it worked.  No names. 
[00:25:00]  You do what you do.  He was the assistant promotion director at the time.  Would you be quiet?  What did he do to you?  He wanted to, for some odd reason, I don't know why, because I got a PhD in ass-kissing  while I was there, wanted to get rid of me.  So once I got an internship with another station in the cluster.  Oh, my God.  He makes up a reason, and instead of, like, a good reason, like, maybe I sexually harassed...  Yeah, he put down that I sexually harassed another guy. 
[00:25:30]  How would you like to mow my lawn, huh?  To get rid of me.  Wow, this is going to be intense radio tonight, man.  Yeah, I would definitely tell everybody to fasten their seatbelts.  I'm going to be sitting in my driveway listening to this instead of going in my house.  Sexually harassed another guy.  Did he say Monster Rain was on the way?  Yeah, this is the type of thing I'm not going to be able to turn off tonight.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  Very compelling.  I'm going to be late for dinner tonight.  I was working on some stuff this morning for getting some audio clips that emailed you guys 
[00:26:00]  when my computer crashed.  Can I ask you a question?  What did you send when you sent the CD?  Was it wrapped in toilet paper?  No.  Actually, it looks really nice.  All right, Paco.  I want to work into it.  You're just a tool.  Yeah.  Paco, you're bombing.  I know, but okay, I suck.  No, you don't suck.  I'm working on it.  You know, I...  Just keep working hard, and you should be up to market number 300 by the time you're 25. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, I'll probably still be in AM Oldies.  All right.  I can't stand that.  I want to get into Rock or something.  Oh, my God.  You don't have a rock accent.  I think we've spent enough time with this gentleman.  All right.  Everyone's staring at the walls, Paco.  Thank you.  Okay.  Sorry.  I fucked the show.  It's all right.  Good luck to you, though, buddy.  Paco.  Yeah?  There you go.  Got him.  I'm really sorry I lost the demo, Anthony. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  All right.  People hand us stuff when we do these appearances, right?  What am I supposed to do with CDs and DVDs and whatnot?  I'm supposed to shove them in my pocket and carry them around for four hours?  I take them.  I either wait till you go away and politely throw them in the garbage pail, not in front  of your face, but now I'm going to start just grabbing them and going, thanks, and smashing  them like Opie.  Or I give them to Big Kev, who disposes of them however he wants. 
[00:27:30]  I got a quick story about that.  Yeah.  Anthony and I have been doing this show together for over 10 years now.  A little over 10 years.  Danvers, and yeah, that's the story I was going to tell.  We did an appearance in Danvers.  Danvers.  Danvers.  Remember when we went up to Danvers and they were doing some kind of drum demo thing?  Yeah, yeah.  A drum clinic.  A drum clinic, and we were broadcasting live.  Oh, God.  Did we do that?  It was one step above the days when I used to broadcast live from gas stations and hand 
[00:28:00]  down roses to the fine ladies that stopped by as I pumped their gas for $1.02 a gallon.  I remember pulling up for some gas from my work van.  And then I locked my keys in the car.  I had an old Honda.  I remember that.  And everyone thought I was this big radio star making a lot of money, and I had to ask  one of the listeners to help me break into my car so I could go home.  And the guy's like, dude, you drive this thing?  I'm like, oh, yeah, my other car's in the shop. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I thought Opie was a rich radio guy when I first met him.  And he's like, yeah, I'll come over to my house later on, man.  It'll be cool.  We'll hang out, watch some movies and stuff, and talk about the show and anything like  that.  Before I even was working in radio, it was just pretty much hanging out on Opie's show.  And I thought he was on radio, so he had to be rich.  I thought everybody on radio was rich.  So I pull up to his house, and it's an apartment in a house, and I thought it had to be your summer 
[00:29:00]  home in Northport.  I was like, this must just be his summer home.  You must have a real nice place somewhere.  But no, you were getting paid crap.  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  So anyway, we were in Danvers for the drum clinic, and our fans were there, and we're  broadcasting live.  And that was the day we met Sully from Godsmack.  And you talk about demos and CDs and stuff.  This is the most classic story ever as far as I go.  This is an oops.  This is a major oops, and this is why I now listen to every CD that someone hands me. 
[00:29:30]  I swear to you, I do.  Whether it's bad, good, or indifferent, I'll at least take a listen.  Sully is one of the coolest guys you'll ever meet.  We go way back with this guy.  And we met him at this thing.  Yeah, he was a big fan of the show.  Probably about eight years ago or so.  And this was before anyone knew who Godsmack was.  And Sully works his balls off.  You want to talk about a guy that sees an opportunity and goes for it.  This guy was working it hard way before they became huge.  They were a local band kicking around Boston. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  So he had a bunch of CDs of his new project, Godsmack.  I don't even know if it was called Godsmack at that time.  And he was handing it out to the local radio guys and some local record stores and this and that.  Anyone that might have an in that could help him get some exposure for his band.  Yeah.  And we hung with Sully.  He really did hit it off and stuff.  But I'm just thinking it's just another guy giving me a CD at the time.  I don't think I've ever admitted this on the show.  You don't know, because it just is the other guy giving you a CD. 
[00:30:30]  So we leave the gig, and I had this habit of anyone who gave me these band CDs, I would smash them while I'm going 70 miles an hour down the highway.  I would open the window, because it really would just explode.  Yeah, they'd explode real nice.  So I'm driving back to Boston with our buddy Jay.  You remember good old Jay from Framingham there.  And I go, Jay, Jesus, another band CD.  My God, open the window.  And I actually took Sully's demo that turned out to be Godsmack, one of the biggest rock bands in the last seven years. 
[00:31:00]  You could have broke it in the good way.  And I threw it in the river, whatever river.  I think technically it's the Connecticut River that cuts through up there or something.  I thought it was in the Charles.  You threw it in the Charles.  No, no.  Well, maybe it's the Charles when it's up north that way.  Okay, it was the Charles River.  I threw a CD in the river.  And then, you know, less than six months later, he becomes this massive, massive rock star.  And I had his CD. 
[00:31:30]  We could have been the guys that broke Godsmack.  But me being the dick that I still am, I threw it out the window into the river.  Listen to this crap.  These guys can't play.  Dude, it wasn't even that.  You know, I've got to defend myself.  Because Godsmack is one of my favorite bands now of the last ten years, easily.  And I didn't even bother putting it in my CD player in my car.  I just said, you know what, another band.  I mean, the guy's cool and stuff.  I wish him the best.  And I just threw it in the river.  You think if you listened to it, you would have went, wow, that's pretty cool? 
[00:32:00]  Definitely.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah, the first time I heard the demo, it wasn't even one of those things that had to grow on me.  I thought it was great.  And if we could have broke that, what an idiot.  I know.  We're like that guy that, you know, turned down signing a huge star.  Awful.  Didn't sign the movie.  You know, the movie company that didn't sign the huge movie.  You know, oh, we refused the Godfather.  The ironic thing is you throw Sully's CD out the window and Voss gives you his and you take it home and enjoy it for hours. 
[00:32:30]  You know what?  I have another confession.  I was going through some of our stuff from the old days there.  You know, I had a whole closet of old CDs and stuff.  You were in the closet last night?  Is that what you're saying?  No.  And I was thinning the herd.  Yeah.  And there was a lot of comedy CDs and stuff.  I did throw Rich Voss' CD out yesterday.  You threw it out?  I swear to God, yeah.  I threw it.  Aw.  And there was some homeless guy that was picking through my garbage and walking away with a lot of our old radio stuff, by the way, which was kind of funny. 
[00:33:00]  It was old carts and stuff.  I'm going to start my own show.  Yeah, the homeless guy's looking at these carts, trying to figure out what the freak is this.  Thinking they're 8-tracks.  Yeah, he had no idea.  Maybe this is cool in the gang.  But I literally got rid of like three or four bags worth of stuff that I just know we don't need for the new show.  Some CDs and carts and old tapes and stuff.  Trust me, nothing valuable. 
[00:33:30]  But then yesterday after the show, I go back to my place and the homeless people were digging through the stuff, walking away with it.  What the hell are they going to do with it?  Oh, they might be starting up a radio show somewhere.  They love just collecting trash.  That's going to sound like us 10 years ago.  The homeless shopping spree.  A couple of the guys bought Walkmans and stuff.  Yeah.  You know.  All right.  Well, we're just getting warmed up.  We have a crazy, crazy show today, let me tell you.  Stephen Lynch is coming in in a little while.  Also, the New York Times reporter's coming back.  Oh.  Yeah, we got in a lot of trouble yesterday because we didn't let the New York Times reporter come in because we had two escorts in the studio. 
[00:34:00]  Yes.  Lovely.  They got really mad, but they're coming back today at 7.30.  Speaking of escorts, Jimmy Norton had his escort experience after the show yesterday.  Yep.  I'm so glad that actually came together and worked.  I bet you are, too.  And we're going to get his review next.  I called him probably, it seemed like less than 10 minutes after you blew your nut, man. 
[00:34:30]  I was still sitting in the place.  Still sitting in the place.  I've never heard him more mellow in my life.  Really?  Just so mellow.  He had nothing to complain about.  He was just like, oh.  Can't wait to hear his full review.  Oh, I wish I taped it.  I wish I taped you.  Oh, my God.  I hope you're not going to believe this was the most.  I mean, so mellow.  Wow.  So mellow.  And we got to talk about the presidential debates. 
[00:35:00]  And, of course, we haven't forgotten, don't worry, good old Bill Hypocrite O'Reilly in the news today.  Oh, this is a big story.  So why don't we step aside for a quick one, and we'll be back.  Six monkeys and a turd-throwing party.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, my name is Jessica.  I'm calling with the newspaper.  Do you know who would be in charge of renewing the subscription?  Uh, I am right now.  Actually, it looked like it was just recently started.  It just hasn't been paid for yet. 
[00:35:30]  Okay, so what do I have to do?  Um, I could take a check or credit card over the phone.  Okay, can I have the address?  P.O. back 501.  I didn't pick up what you just said.  Okay, it's McLean, Virginia.  M.C.O.  M.C.L.E.A.N.  Virginia.  Okay, and then I just send it to that address, and that's 90725, right?  P.O. back 501.  570.  5.016.  5.016. 
[00:36:00]  5.016.  All right, well, maybe you could just give me your address.  I just gave you the address.  But you went so fast, ma'am.  I can give it to you one more time.  I know, but I just want to make sure I've got the right address.  P.O. back 501 McLean.  Is that used to be McLean again?  M.C.  Right.  L.E.A.N.  Virginia.  Ugh.  2-2-1-0-2.  Well, slow down.  Are you going to a fire or something?  Is there anything else I can help you with? 
[00:36:30]  When do I have to mail the check?  You mail the check out, and we receive it by May 22nd.  You will not have any disruption.  So how many weeks would that be?  I can't tell you the exact date.  Okay, you started the subscription.  We give you a certain amount of time to send the check in.  But I have a whole checkbook of when I send my checks out.  Well, then you're going to have to send us a copy of it.  I've never seen a check like that before.  Well, then, because you didn't pay for it.  I know, but how is he going to pay for it when he doesn't know when he has to mail the check in?  May 22nd.  Yeah, May 22nd. 
[00:37:00]  That's what you said before.  It has to be mailed in by May 22nd, or the paper will stop.  There's a lot of knuckleheads out there, and I don't know if I'll get the check out in time.  The paper's going to stop if we don't receive a check.  I know, but they're going to pay for it.  They're just going to check me out.  If you'd like to check into it and give us a call back, I gave you the customer service number of 1-800.  Now, is that going to be a toll on my phone bill?  No, it's toll-free.  Because I don't have long distance.  It got switched off.  Okay, is there anything else I can help?  Okay, how much is it to get it for a year? 
[00:37:30]  For a year, it's $119.  Does this delivery include the Sunday paper?  No, it's only Monday through Friday.  They don't even sell it on the newsstand?  No, we don't have...  For the Sunday paper?  We don't have a Saturday or Sunday paper at all.  The one I'm getting now, it comes on the weekend.  Well, you have all the information, so if you would like to continue with the...  And the check's for $139 for the six months, right?  No.  Three months at seven months...  That's what you said, ma'am.  You said $139 for six months.  No, I didn't...  Including the weekends. 
[00:38:00]  I'm sorry, if you have any other questions, please call the customer service number.  I do have a question, miss.  I don't know why.  Okay, then you're going to...  We're having a problem.  Okay, well, I don't think that I can help you because I'm telling you some information  and you're saying something completely different back to me.  I've tried to give you the information.  Miss, I know.  We're just trying to ask a couple of questions.  Okay, well, I don't think I can assist you any further, but I can't give you our customer service number.  Miss, do you want...  No, I don't need your customer. 
[00:38:30]  I just want to know when I'm in the mail and check out...  It has to be mailed by May 22nd.  Jessica, I'm getting very confused with all these voices.  I know.  For some reason, I keep hearing all these different voices, too.  I'm sorry if I'm unable to help you any further.  I gave you our customer service line.  But why can't we...  I asked you the question.  Because I cannot answer that for you.  I don't have that information.  Miss, what...  I gave you all the information I have.  Why are you yelling at me?  I'm not yelling.  I'm just telling you I gave you all the information I have and I can't help you any further.  But it's just a simple question.  Yes, and I'm sorry.  I guess I can't answer simple questions.  The other thing is, do we have a confirmation number? 
[00:39:00]  There is no confirmation number.  Just let them know you spoke to Jessica.  Yeah, but there's probably a lot of Jessicas that work for...  No, there isn't.  I'm the only one.  And I'm sorry, I have to go...  You're the only one.  You're the only Jessica that works for...  I don't believe you.  I really find a good sound effect of a guy getting hit in the head with a shovel.  Good evening, sir.  May I interest you in our soup de jour?  Shut the fuck up, you goddamn fuckhole! 
[00:39:30]  You piece of shit!  It's the ONA virus.  Welcome.  Welcome.  What's this story that's coming across our news desk, Anthony?  Another one of these news desks.  Let me tap.  Oh no, I tap it up, sorry.  Yes, no tapping those pens.  I've removed the pens from the area.  Except for this one, because I'm writing down little antidotes as we go along here. 
[00:40:00]  Antidotes?  Little thought starters in my little notepad.  An antidote.  Let me tell you something.  This notepad is making the show more gooder.  More gooder.  Because none of us have memories.  Opie, I never know what to believe in the news.  Pierce, from Reuters, there's a story of Shanghai men, men in Shanghai getting breast implants.  They're doing this not for boobage. 
[00:40:30]  They're doing this for big pecs.  To make it look like they have big pecs.  They want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Yeah, I do believe the Asians just want to look like American men.  They want to look, yeah, like they're not Asian.  These stories come, but you know what it is?  I never believe these stories that come out of China to the extent that there are a lot of people doing this.  No, they do a lot of wacky things in Asia.  I think there's just a lot of people over there, so somebody's going to do a little bit of anything. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  But they report on it like every guy in China now is running out to get these things.  Yeah, they're lining up for their breast implants.  Remember that they were transplanting pubic hair?  That's a true story.  I saw that.  The Chinese men wanted to have hairy chest, once again, like American men.  And they were getting their pubic hair transplanted onto their chest.  Yes.  Right.  I saw that article.  I saw that news story.  Well, sorry, tapping the pen.  I saw that news story, yes. 
[00:41:30]  Pubic hair transplanted on their chest.  And then they also wanted curlier pubic hair.  That was another story I read.  Ugh.  I don't believe all this is going on.  But the implants, they say, could be very dangerous.  They're doing it to impress their boss, women, with their big peitorumosu.  And like I said, I don't believe it's really happening.  China. 
[00:42:00]  There's just a billion expressionless-faced people doing odd things.  I believe that a lot of them are.  Would you want to just look like one of all of those smooth creeps?  Perfect abs, good chests, great fighters.  We get it.  You've seen one.  You've met all of them.  It's time now to turn this mush into muscles.  That's right.  You lack discipline.  Don't get implants.  Work out.  Come on.  Hey, Kevin, what's going on? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, I want to bitch about XM Radio.  Why?  Because, okay, I went out and I got a roadie, too.  Yeah?  Tried to find a home kit.  Yeah?  I didn't have anything in this area.  Then yesterday, okay, I've been watching the stock since you guys signed on.  Right.  And I find out you can get it through Window Media Play now.  Yeah, I think they're streaming some of the channels, I believe.  So now every idiot in the world has an XM Radio.  All right.  But do they have it on their web page?  Do these guys know how to advertise whatsoever? 
[00:43:00]  I think they're still, I don't know, Jaime, what?  Hang up on them?  What?  Start selling them the 16th of, uh...  Wait, wait, here's Jaime.  By the way, Jaime is back in town.  This guy kicks ass and takes care of problems.  Yes, Jaime?  He's all pissed off, too.  There's a whole web page on it, too.  Oh, there's a whole web page up on XMRadio.com?  There's a whole web page up on XMRadio.com about this, Kevin.  He's the problem solver.  All right?  There's a link. 
[00:43:30]  I'm going to give it to this guy.  Look at Jaime.  He's mad.  I love it.  Come on, Jaime.  Buffalo was one of your biggest markets.  All right, wait.  Here he goes, Kevin.  Go ahead.  Buffalo was one of their biggest markets.  No, no, no, Kevin.  Kevin, I just want to give you the web link so you go there and you can read all about  XMRadio online.  Yeah, go ahead, Jaime.  XMRadio.com forward slash XStream.  I don't know if he can hear you.  I can't hear you.  Through the phones, yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, he can't hear you through the phones, Jaime.  It's on XMRadio.com.  There's the...  Forward slash XStream.  Forward slash XStream.  XStream.  But, Opie, that's only the tip of the iceberg.  You guys were big as hell in Buffalo.  Right.  Nobody knows you're on XM.  That's not true.  I wish I could talk about how many people have signed up so far.  It's getting a little crazy.  I mean, this thing is spreading faster than even Anthony and I thought would spread.  So, no, I'm telling you, it's happening big time.  And just wait to see what we do next, okay? 
[00:44:30]  This is just the beginning.  I just don't want to see that idiot beat you guys.  Who, Howard?  Yes.  Oh, don't worry about that.  That ain't happening.  Trust me.  Don't you worry about that.  We're the better...  When it comes right down to it, we're the better show.  We are so much better than Howard.  It's not even funny.  We don't spend three hours thinking that Bush is after us.  We don't spend two hours talking about a naked chick and how he wants to do them.  And make a fool of myself in public.  Yeah, I mean, we have so much more variety going on in this show. 
[00:45:00]  You just wait and see what happens next.  Trust me on that.  You're the only reason I bought XM.  All right?  I mean, we could have went to Sirius.  We decided XM Satellite Radio was the place to be.  It's the better company.  Everyone knows that.  They know that on Wall Street.  Howard could have came to XM.  But despite himself, he didn't want to come here because we were here.  WNBC.  He picked the worst company.  Trust me on that.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  And everyone's excited about, you know, how we're going to Satellite Radio. 
[00:45:30]  The fact is, by the time he starts broadcasting there, he's going to be pushing about 55 years old, okay?  Leave the Satellite Radio to the kids.  Everything I do is misunderstood.  Leave the future radio to Opie and Anthony, okay?  Your time is coming.  There was a time.  I've got Allison.  Let me explain something to people, okay?  Because everyone's excited about how we're going to Satellite.  Here's the deal.  We speak the truth on this show, okay?  Was Howard great?  Absolutely. 
[00:46:00]  Howard.  Absolutely Howard was great.  Ah.  To sit here and act like he wasn't, you know, people could see right through that shit.  Oh!  Of course he was great, okay?  Oh!  Is this show as good as it used to be?  No.  Nowhere's fucking close.  Ah.  Okay?  Nowhere's close.  Ah.  Sirius is taking a huge gamble by signing Howard to a half-billion-dollar contract.  A huge gamble, okay?  Oh!  Howard. 
[00:46:30]  Howard.  Let's put it in terms where people can understand.  There was a time that Joe Montana was the best, right?  Howard's son, he kissed my ass in the hell!  Joe Montana was the best quarterback in the NFL, wasn't he?  I remember those days, sure.  There was a time that Joe Montana had to move on, and there were a lot of excited people  in Kansas City.  Mm-hmm.  He was a Kansas City chief.  How many people remember Joe Montana as a Kansas City chief? 
[00:47:00]  No.  Not many, okay?  Mm-mm.  How about Michael Jordan?  Michael Jordan was the greatest athlete of all time.  It's debatable.  Ali's right up there, too, okay?  Jordan was unbelievable with the Chicago Bulls, right?  Right.  But Jordan moved on to the Washington Wizards.  How many people are going to remember Jordan as a Washington Wizard?  Not many.  Not many.  How about Willie Mays, Anthony?  Ah, say hey, Willie.  One of the greatest home run hitters of all time. 
[00:47:30]  Sure.  There was a time when I was growing up, I was just a little taut, and I read the sports  section and found out that the Mets got Willie Mays.  How excited were you?  I'm the biggest Mets fan in the world, Anthony.  Yeah.  I was so excited that we finally got a real player on our team.  Going to be able to go to Shea and watch him play for the Mets.  He made a complete fool out of himself in the outfield.  Yeah.  It's like Babe Ruth, a great pitcher for the Boston Red Sox.  And then he goes on to the, who's going to remember him?  I was going to remember him as a Yankee. 
[00:48:00]  You're such a pussy.  Babe Ruth.  I'm glad you brought up Babe Ruth.  You know Babe Ruth played after the Yankees, don't you?  No one really remembers, and most people don't even know the team he was on after the Yankees.  Yes.  I do believe it was the Boston Braves.  I think he went back to Boston.  Yeah.  I'm not positive about that, but there are pictures of Babe Ruth in another uniform after  he played with the Yankees.  Yep.  Okay.  That big head, running in fast motion, fat ass around the bases. 
[00:48:30]  I love that guy.  We have just begun, fellas.  Oh!  And ladies.  Ah.  This is going to be a lot of fun.  Okay?  We're in our prime right now, not on the other side of our prime.  Everything I do is misunderstood.  So don't you worry.  It's XM's job to get us as much exposure as possible, because when it comes down to it, 
[00:49:00]  our show against Howard's, we win.  Guaranteed.  Yeah.  I guess they don't trust us to get our own exposure.  That usually goes horribly wrong.  Well, you know, we should talk about that a little bit.  This is where it went horribly wrong in our last job.  We expected the company to expose Opie and Anthony to a lot of people.  Yeah.  And it just didn't happen.  So Anthony and I had to make our own noise, and then guess what? 
[00:49:30]  We start doing things that get our name in the press.  And then we screwed up big.  And then we went a little too far.  So XM's job, I've said this a few times, they have to expose us and make sure people  understand that this unbelievable radio show is out there happening.  Our listeners will help us out.  They'll help spread the virus and spread it to new listeners.  We understand that, okay?  Yes.  Howard has a bigger name recognition than us.  We know that.  That's the reality, too.  Yes, we understand that.  And that's where he's got a little bit of a lead on us, Anthony. 
[00:50:00]  But if XM gets our name recognition up, we will win this battle.  You better recognize.  You better recognize.  Well, why don't you bring it?  It's already been brought in.  Yes, Ben.  Okay.  Oh.  All right.  You know what?  The show's kind of boring so far.  We understand that.  We got to talk about Jim Norton here.  That's what I want to hear.  I want to hear how everything went. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  A lot of uncomfortable people in Washington yesterday.  Really?  Well, we had escorts in the studio yesterday.  Yeah.  And they did some great radio for us.  What was the name of the website again?  NYconfidential.com.  NYconfidential.com.  And you want to see some hot chicks?  Just go on that site.  Holy cow.  Yeah, and we found out that the girls on the website are the ones that come to your door.  Oh, yeah.  You know, because Norton, we're learning a lot about, I don't want to say that word. 
[00:51:00]  About the scene, man.  Yeah, we're learning a lot about the ladies of the night.  Escorts and how you get them and how you act when they come to your door and how they're paid for and all that fun stuff.  Jimmy is a pro.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were talking about bait and switch and stuff.  You see a beautiful girl in one of these advertisements.  Yeah.  And it's not the girl that comes to your door.  Yeah.  It happens all the time.  But the actual photo, and it is an actual photo, but just not of the girl.  Not of the girl.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  So nyconfidential.com, these girls.  Didn't that happen in risky business?  Tom Cruise called up for an escort.  I don't think he was looking at...  Oh, there was no picture?  I don't think he was looking at...  But then the black guy came to the door?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he had to pay him?  Jackie.  His name was Jackie.  Yeah.  Jackie.  Jackie.  The bait and switch.  But they don't do the bait and switch with nyconfidential.com.  I mean, the girls showed up that were on the website.  They were unbelievable.  And we set up a little date for Jim Norton. 
[00:52:00]  Actually, we all get our free hour.  I heard we all get an hour.  We all get an hour, and so far, I don't know how many people are going to admit they used  their free hour.  I know one has, so far.  You can bet I have, and I'm looking for your free hours to be donated.  Donated to you, right?  Oh, gobble them up.  You'll gobble up all the free hours?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Dude, yeah.  I still have boxes to unpack in my house.  I was wondering if one could come over and help me just unpack.  Right, right.  Maybe that.  No, it's funny. 
[00:52:30]  Yard work.  I don't know.  We all get free hours, and when I just mentioned that, everyone that works for the show, they  all started looking very busy and looking down, and all of a sudden, they're checking  knobs and stuff.  Yes, I'm working hard.  Please.  Please don't look my way.  So, Norton did use his free hour.  Yeah.  It was great.  I was kind of hoping, in a weird way, that it would be awkward or something, so I could  goof on it, because it would be funnier.  Rave review?  I'm honest when I tell you, I can't tell you how long I've been doing this, probably 
[00:53:00]  since I was 20, and I'm 36.  Two thumbs in.  I gave it a fist up.  It was the best escort experience I've ever had.  Wow.  Now, coming from you, all over her.  That spends well over $20,000 to $30,000 a year on this.  Yeah.  On your little hobby.  Best escort experience ever.  I talked to the guy, Jason, who runs the place, and I think he's the owner, and we're  talking, and he wanted me to come into their place. 
[00:53:30]  I think he's like, I was, he was kind of worried, he said that somebody else would call pretending  to be me and have the girl just go there.  Uh-huh.  You know, which is actually a pretty smart move.  If any of you dummies would have thought of that.  Wow.  Imagine that.  Yeah, I'm Jimmy Norton.  Come down here.  How will I know it's you?  I have a weak chin and tits and no body hair.  All right.  That could be half of New York.  The lights will be out.  Just walk in and start sucking.  Wait a minute.  Someone might be using my free hour right now, and I don't even know it.  Yeah, some blonde guy with great abs and a keen smile.  Ladies, be careful.  Just because he has sandy blonde hair and a nice smile.  No, it's a guyless. 
[00:54:00]  Like the guyless smile.  Guyless smile.  What's that mean?  It was, I don't know.  Penetrating blue eyes.  I don't know.  It was in one of these stupid articles.  Opie with his guyless smile.  Smile?  G-U-I-L-E-S-S-T.  Oh, guileless.  Guileless.  There's no guile to your smile.  No guile at all.  All right, whatever.  I don't know what that means.  All right, so we went off the air yesterday, and the lovely ladies left.  And, well, we all went out to breakfast and stuff.  So then what happened?  Take us through this step by step, Jimmy. 
[00:54:30]  I wind up calling the place, and I talk to Jason, and he has me.  I go down into, let's just say Tribeca, the place was.  And I arrive at promptly 3.30.  I'm never on time, but I was.  Wait, is it an actual house?  Well, not in Manhattan.  It's not a house.  Well, you know what I mean.  Is it like a?  It's in a loft, in a big building in a loft.  Okay.  With just a lot of rooms?  Well, I didn't know until I rang the bell, and I met the gentleman at the door. 
[00:55:00]  And there's a grand piano inside when you walk in.  There's like a big.  Oh, that says classy joint.  Big screen TV on the wall.  I mean, unbelievable.  It's like, you know, it's money.  Hot chicks all over the place.  And he's showing me around.  He walks in.  That girl, Katie, that we saw the day was sleeping in bed.  He takes me into her room.  He doesn't care that she's sleeping.  He's like, yeah, this is one of the rooms.  And the girl's like, ugh.  He's asleep in there.  Oh, this guy was great.  He's drinking scotch. 
[00:55:30]  He just didn't give a shit.  Say hi to Jim.  You know, she wants to cut my throat and kick me, but she's like, hi.  She's just trying to take a nap in between clients.  She's just trying to relax.  Take a load off, and he walks in with a scotch.  Load off.  Oh, that's hilarious.  And then they take me into this.  Did he have a pipe and a bathrobe on?  Oh, no.  He was wearing a short sleeve.  No, no.  He looks actually like an Israeli soldier.  He has short hair and a tattoo.  And he's obviously, yeah, he's a psychopath.  And he takes me into the other room. 
[00:56:00]  And Natalia, the girl who was in here, runs out naked out of the shower and goes, hi, and  jumps into my arms.  Jumps into my arms and hugs me.  It was like an officer and a gentleman moment with a hot chick, except I don't look like  a military serviceman.  It was exactly what it was like.  Way to go, Natalia.  You go.  Oh, she kisses me.  I mean, it was so surreal.  Because usually when you go, you never feel like they like you. 
[00:56:30]  We're not going to find you dead when you realize that she doesn't really like you,  are we?  Dude, I think she does.  Oh, you pathetic man.  I think she does.  Oh, we got one of those guys working for the show.  I go out.  He's in the room.  You're the guy.  You're the guy that goes to the strip club and is convinced that the girl wants to go  home with you.  Dude, she digs me, man.  Yeah.  I could tell.  No, you guys go ahead, man.  I'm staying.  I'll figure out how to get back to Long Island.  She's giving me a different vibe than she's giving you guys.  Face it.  By the way, you got a couple hundred bucks. 
[00:57:00]  I ran out.  I already spent 500, but I think I got her number now, man.  You know, I slip her 20s, man, because she likes me.  Yeah.  You guys just take the limo.  I don't know.  I'll go down to Penn Station and take the Long Island Railroad home.  Yeah.  I'm cutting out with this chick, man.  You know who did that?  Psycho Mark.  Oh, right, right.  At one of the bachelor parties we went to.  He was convinced the girl loved him.  This girl loves me.  How much did he end up spending?  Hundreds.  Hundreds?  Do you know who I am?  This chick digs me. 
[00:57:30]  He swore that this girl was falling in love with him right there.  What an idiot.  Uh-uh.  There's always one.  Not accusing you.  No, I know.  But you really think this girl...  See, they're very...  I guess because they make good money or whatever, but they're very genuine.  Like, I've dated so much.  I know that, you know, I'm just a guy.  But if you're nice, if you're respectful, they're going to treat you very well.  So she jumps on my arm and gives me a kiss.  I'm going to hook up with another Canadian girl who's a 10.  And he goes, why don't you have both?  And I'm like, I don't want to be Gary Greedy. 
[00:58:00]  I'm like, I don't know.  Usually I like one.  He's like, go ahead.  Hang out with both.  They're both great.  He's like, trust me.  Trust me.  So I go and I sit on the couch and I'm talking to one.  Another girl walks in.  He goes, hey, lift up your skirt.  And she lifts up her skirt and he lets me smell.  He's like, go ahead, smell.  Smell, smell her.  What?  Yeah.  He's like, it's the nicest one.  So I smell it.  Are you kidding?  No.  And then I go into the black chick comes in, this chick named Midnight.  So there's just hot chicks walking around.  Dude, it's depressing.  Are they in lingerie? 
[00:58:30]  The one Natalia was, Midnight, he made get naked for me.  He takes me to the room.  Midnight has to be the black chick, right?  I don't think that's her real name, though.  I don't think so.  But she had, I'm not exaggerating, the nicest ass I've ever seen on a human being.  It was on this chick.  It was fucking amazing.  So I take Natalia.  I'm very happy.  We're kissing and hugging.  Oh, my goodness.  You're kissing and hugging?  Mouth kissing.  Yeah, nicely.  Girlfriend experience.  Girlfriend experience.  Girlfriend experience. 
[00:59:00]  I had never heard of that before the other day.  I'm trying to get the visual a little better, all right?  Okay.  So you're in the, it's the penthouse area and girls are walking around half naked, blah, blah,  and you're sniffing and checking them out and stuff.  So then you decide on the girl that was in here?  Yeah, only because the other girl, we wound up talking to the owner.  He's a fan of the show.  No, they're all great.  I'm just, all right.  No, no, I'm saying the guy that we were rapping with, we were talking for like 45 minutes.  The other girl had another gig to go to.  She had a job to do.  So she was like, it was running late, but that was my fault just for yapping with him.  So I could, the one girl I was supposed to see had to go.  Okay. 
[00:59:30]  45 minutes later.  So I didn't care.  I was just like, oh, I'm in Italia.  All right.  So we're all tens.  Who cares?  So now she just kind of grabs your hand and you walk off?  Yeah, we walk into the next room.  There's a king-sized bed with like a foot of like the fluffy foam on it.  It's phenomenal, dude.  It's like a five-star hotel.  The only thing wrong with the picture was my stomach and tits.  The fact that I had to be unclothed.  And she was really digging you.  So what else was in the room?  Satin sheets?  I mean, you know.  No, just a king-sized bed with big pillows.  There's a huge sunroof, like sky roof. 
[01:00:00]  What do they call that?  Skylight?  Skylight.  Yeah, the whole roof is like a glass.  Really?  Yeah.  So I was kind of hoping it was like a darker room.  Again, I'm embarrassed to get naked.  Yeah, I know.  That's like daylight coming in on you.  But that would be perfect at like 9 o'clock at night where you'd have the city lights.  Or if you were in some kind of physical shape like a man.  So I get naked.  The daytime.  Jimmy just gets an ass burn from the sunlight coming through.  So you locked the door, whatever, closed the door?  Yeah.  Can you hear that?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  There's music blasting through.  The Sinatra playing.  It wasn't Sinatra, wasn't it?  I swear to God.  Oh, blue eyes.  Better than that.  The CD player in the room wasn't working.  We're going to listen to something.  Sinatra's blasting through.  In the middle of it, I hear the song, Forget Me Not.  I didn't know that was the Sinatra song.  Oh, no, really?  No way.  Yeah, I'm trying to get Hummer, and I hear this song blasting through.  Oh, man.  So we start off making out.  Distraction?  Yeah, it really was. 
[01:01:00]  But I wanted the Sinatra instead of the Beastie Boys.  Yeah.  Start spreading your legs.  Gym's coming today.  Just grab my meaty tits.  I'm gonna get laid.  Dude, this chick's digging me.  Yeah, baby.  Look at my flappy ass. 
[01:01:30]  That's right, toots.  Did you call it toots with the music playing?  No, it was very gentlemanly.  You got nice stems, dame.  No?  Nothing like that?  Now, do they have a bar?  Like, for martinis and things like that?  Oh, yeah, whatever you want, they'll bring you.  See, if you'd like it, you can get alcohol.  Yeah, they were really, really odd.  Get me a scotch, friend.  They were very accommodating with alcohol, whatever you want, which I don't drink.  I'm king of the hill. 
[01:02:00]  Open up, honey.  I'm sinking it deep.  Now?  Wow.  Wow.  All right, so you're in the room.  The Sinatra's playing.  Yeah.  Now, what's the first move?  Yeah.  You start making out.  What is she wearing now, like lingerie?  She's wearing thigh-highs with garters.  Right.  Like lingerie, just dirty, naughty.  Jimmy then made a fort out of the blanket.  Let's make a fort.  No? 
[01:02:30]  No.  So when did you lay down the tarp?  Yeah.  And the plastic.  And the plastic.  There were no toilet games.  There was no temple.  Did they supply the plastic and the duct tape?  It was a very nice experience.  See, this is what confuses me about Jimmy.  You like the nice experiences, and then you also like to get really dirty with this thing.  Yeah, you can't add.  I just couldn't have asked a girl.  She was too hot and too nice and kissing me like a girlfriend.  You're just going for the girlfriend experience, not the mother experience.  Yeah, I couldn't, you know. 
[01:03:00]  Hey, listen, I know we're kissing and getting along, but, you know, if you have to go, just,  you know, put a finger up and I'll lay on the bathroom floor.  I don't want to kill the mood.  I felt it would be inappropriate to mention that.  So you didn't have to lay down any plastic.  No, it was one of the most normal ones I've had.  So we're kissing, and it's going very well, and then she lays me back.  Is she saying anything to you?  No, but she's, if she, look, I have to assume that any time an escort is with you that  they're kind of, like, acting as well.  But they should have handed her a trophy when she was finished.  You really thought she liked you.  Dude, really.  It was unbelievable. 
[01:03:30]  But that's how they get you to come back.  Well, it worked.  I can't believe it.  You're a hooker!  And I thought I was doing well with you.  We're kissing.  I perform oral treats on her.  I can't believe you're a hooker!  It was wonderful.  How much for the two of you?  I believe, I think you really like me. 
[01:04:00]  I'm a pathetic little mess with meaty breasts.  She's taking the knife out of the cheese.  You think she wants some cheese?  You really thought she liked you.  Dude.  That's amazing.  It was, she was that good.  She was giving me a hummer.  Right.  A hummer!  This story just seems this much better with this music. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  Nice background music.  And Jim may have came while you were yelling.  It's a very small country.  This one's a goner.  This penis is a goner.  So we're kissing.  Yeah.  And we're having sex for a while.  You know, and I had a bag on, unfortunately.  I tried to kind of get cute and slip it, but I was wearing a bag. 
[01:05:00]  All right, so, well, I mean, this is step by step.  So you guys are making out and stuff, and you're feeling her up and things like that.  I always find that weird, like, after sitting with her in the studio here and having to negotiate, you know, things like the wiffle ball bat thing.  And, you know, hey, could you take your clothes off and stuff?  And then you're in a room, and you know you're going to town.  She was so cool, man.  It was, I can't, I really, I almost wanted to come in.  I wish I kind of had a bad experience because it got funnier.  But it was unbelievable. 
[01:05:30]  I would never have been that happy with a date like that.  Now, yeah, okay, continue.  So we're kissing, and she starts to, you know, I lay back.  I perform oral treats on her.  You did?  Of course.  Front and back.  Oh, my God.  The whole kit and caboodle.  Now, are you, how do you know she hasn't been with somebody else?  Like, you're too clean.  You can't.  It's cleaner than a chicken meat in a club because they use stuff.  They use protection for almost everything you do.  You tell yourself that.  You keep telling yourself that.  Well, you know, I don't care.  Look, she should have been worried, but I wasn't. 
[01:06:00]  So you pulled a dog-meeting dog with each other?  I was on, yeah.  So she goes, it's actually a good way to look at it.  Spinning around in circles on the floor, sniffing ass.  Yeah?  So I go down on her, and she's going down on me, and then she climbs up, and she's kissing  me, and it's just, it's so nice.  And then she puts a bag on me, and she sits on my...  Did you need any help?  What?  Did you take anything?  No.  No, what did I have taken?  Like the Viagra and all that? 
[01:06:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  I knew I wouldn't need it.  Did you look at her?  No.  These were all tens.  You take that with a five, you know, or five, or someone who's kind of fat who's coming  over.  But this one was phenomenal.  So she did the lay you on your back, and she mounted you like that?  Yeah, and it was hot.  Wow.  Kissing, and I can't, I'm playing with my own nipples, and she didn't look at me weird.  That's how I know she was good.  I'm toying with my nipples, old praying mantis fingers, and she's still riding it like she's  enjoying herself.  You know, I've heard you bring that up a lot.  I don't get that. 
[01:07:00]  What, the nipple thing?  Yeah.  It feels good.  Yeah, but it looks stupid, though.  I don't care.  It looks stupid.  No matter what I do in bed, I look awful.  There may be things that feel good, but you're not going to break it out of your  repertoire if you know it looks stupid.  Well, I had to.  I was on my back, so it wasn't as awkward.  Because people can't see at home.  I mean, even when you show what you do, it's just, look, look, this is me doing it.  Look how awful this is.  I'm laying on my back, and I have my, like, my right hand is toying with my right nipple,  and my left hand is toying with my left nipple.  Wouldn't you rather toy with hers?  I did toy with hers. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, she kept taking my hand, and when she was going down on me, she kept taking my  hand and putting it in her hair to, like, hold her head.  That was kind of hot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's one of the hottest things.  So I was holding the hair, and she was encouraging it, and I would push the head down a little,  and she would go, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Did she just do a little, uh-huh?  Um, no, she's, no, please, no.  You take the phone off of the dresser and just wail it against the side of her head?  No, this isn't Midnight Cowboy.  I wasn't calling anyone, Joe.  You're a lovely person.  You're a lovely person.  Oh, hello, mother. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, I got a sick kid, mister.  Oh, I loathe life.  I loathe it.  All right, so you guys are really getting into it now.  Yeah, and we're having sex, and she said one of the sexiest things ever.  Many different positions, or did you just?  No, I was, she was on top of me, and then she gets, she's like, come on, get behind me.  So I get behind her, and she's going crazy.  Again, is she enjoying it?  The only reason I doubted it is because I know my own performance is normally horrendous.  It was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world. 
[01:08:30]  Wow, that's a rousing endorsement.  So I'm holding her hips, and I'm getting close, and then she looks back and goes,  do you want to come in my mouth?  Hey.  Hey.  How about that?  How about that?  Yes.  It's the sexiest thing anybody has ever said to me.  So I say, yeah, I'd like that.  Okay.  And the worst thing, I lay back.  Well, sure.  Yanks the bag off, starts going back.  Wow.  What a trooper. 
[01:09:00]  What a good egg.  And the whole thing, as this is happening, I'm afraid I'm going to fart.  I had a fart built up that I was afraid it was going to shoot out while I came, but it  didn't.  You don't want to do that.  And I did.  And oh my God.  And it was unbelievable.  And then a mouthful of Captain Trips.  Mouthful of plague.  And then what happens after that?  Then you're just laying there and she cuddled.  What?  She cuddled.  With who?  Me. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  I thought there was someone else in the room.  No, a real man came in for some cuddling.  I'll cuddle with you now.  How long was it?  The whole experience?  Over an hour.  Well, I was there for like two and a half hours.  No, but I mean, after you went into the room.  Oh, probably an hour.  A little over an hour.  He was banging cocktail wages just two at a time.  Yeah, his machine needs to be a little higher, I think.  If we could take care of that.  Yeah.  But wow.  Awesome.  I just, it was unbelievable.  He was going to give me two, but I was like, I don't want to be greedy.  And then you kissed her on the cheek.  Well, the mouth. 
[01:10:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  And then taste your own seed.  I didn't care.  And then I must have called you minutes after you were done.  Because I've never heard you.  I wish I taped it.  You were so mellow.  I was really happy.  Just like, wow.  Because you don't feel rushed.  You don't feel any pressure.  It was fantastic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What an endorsement.  I really mean it, too.  And it's a very sincere endorsement.  NYconfidential.com.  Fantastic.  For your girlfriend experiences needs.  Wait, girlfriend experience needs.  Girlfriend experience. 
[01:10:30]  They're upper class girls.  They're not like the type of girls I would normally call because they're just, you know.  So it's a little more higher end than you're used to getting.  Yeah, absolutely.  You know.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris in Long Island.  Hey, Chris.  What's up, boys?  Jimmy, how is the lips?  Something close and personal.  You mean the lower ones?  Oh, yeah.  They were fat and perfect.  Oh, that's beautiful.  Yeah, it really was.  It was like Angelina Jolie's face.  Like, that's how, those are the type of thick, lovely. 
[01:11:00]  Did she get engorged?  She was when she got her thing off.  Swollen.  Yeah.  Very, very nice.  Do you think she was turned on at all?  I mean, you're a smart guy.  I know.  I mean, come on.  I mean, was she acting or was there part of it she was definitely turned on by the experience?  I think that she was.  I mean, again, look at me.  I mean, any time, if I would say no, it would just be a reflection on my own awfulness.  But she got wet.  I mean, you know, not to be too nasty, but she really did.  And that's something you really can't fake.  Right. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, sure.  Well, no, it's hard to fake.  Sure, they can.  How can they, though?  Let's go to Rico.  Hey, Rico.  I'm so jaded.  I just think they're all business.  I've always thought that, too.  And I've dated.  Believe me, I've been on a thousand dates.  Yeah.  So I always know.  It's been, but.  All right.  Dates.  Makes it sound like they're going to the malt shop in a movie.  You could do that if you like.  We're on a date.  It's not much of a difference at times, though.  Rico.  Hey, good morning, everybody.  Hey.  I was just wondering if she had a chance to smell your belly button. 
[01:12:00]  If she did, did you get a picture of her puking?  No, sir.  There was no belly button sniffing.  And this is how stupid Bob Kelly is.  He comes up to me.  I'm talking to a girl and her friend.  And he goes, dude, let him smell your belly button while I'm talking to a chick.  And I'm like, what?  He goes, dude, don't you wash your belly button?  Cockblocker.  But he didn't mean to be a cockblocker.  Bob's just dumb.  We have a lot of questions coming in.  Let's go to Tim in New Jersey.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going, fellas?  Hi, Tim in Jersey.  Well, it's Tim in Jersey, and he's calling the show. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, what's up, man?  We've got to get this girl to call the show, by the way.  Is she up?  She's probably not up, right?  I don't know.  And then Jason said that they would call.  Well, when do they start their work day?  I honestly don't know what time they open.  I think they're 24-7, so there should be somebody there.  Yeah, I already talked to them.  She was asleep.  She's asleep?  Does she sleep there?  Yes, sir.  Yeah, go ahead.  Why would you kiss a stripper?  That's like kissing a Komodo dragon.  There's so many diseases and bacteria, isn't that shit?  That's not true, sir.  It's not true.  Oh, come on. 
[01:13:00]  No, not at all.  No?  No.  It's just kissing.  Who cares?  I have an immune system.  She said, what, you mean, a cold?  Oh, yeah?  Well, I'm going to give you AIDS.  What?  I just gave you AIDS.  Sir?  Hello?  Yeah, he's gone.  Why?  I don't know.  So Frank Sinatra was singing this song.  Yeah, in the middle of my sex.  You make me feel so young. 
[01:13:30]  It really was funny.  You make me feel so spring as prong.  Spring as prong.  And every time I see you bring.  In your bun.  And he doesn't care.  Sniffing.  Did you?  Of course I did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big sniff.  Yeah, right in there.  With my meat.  I want to go.  Go and bounce the moon.  Oh, yeah.  Just like a toy balloon.  You were bouncing, all right.  Toy balloon on his schlong. 
[01:14:00]  You and I.  I did nothing.  I just laid there.  She took a moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just like a couple of tots.  Couple of tots.  Running across the mountain.  Drink my jizz.  We were like a couple of tots.  Watch as your jawbone rots.  We were like a couple of tots.  The type that are featured on Gary Glitter's computer.  If you go to the website, Natalia is the one, by the way.  She's beautiful. 
[01:14:30]  Jason from Boston.  It's called shampooing when you rub the girl's head while she's blowing you.  Oh, shampooing.  I've never heard that one before.  She gets a mouth full of cream rinse.  You make me feel so young.  This is sent in by Natalie.  Wants to talk about Jim Norton's conscience.  Seriously, Jim, none of that treatment had anything to do with the fact that you were going to talk about this on satellite radio,  which is broadcasted all over the country.  Well, you could look at it like that if you're Jim Norton on the rusty trombone, everyone. 
[01:15:00]  Jim Norton.  A henchman from Brooklyn.  They know Jimmy's addiction, and they want to be his main pusher.  Yeah, they gave you the first one for free, man.  It's over, Johnny.  Because I was talking to Jim.  I'm like, this is way too dangerous.  Because he already spends a lot of money on this service.  Yes.  You're not even going to go back to the old way.  You're going to be calling these people like crazy.  Dope, man.  Dope, man.  I know they're going to be giving, you know, they're going to help you out, but after a while, though, man, you're going to be spending some serious cash. 
[01:15:30]  You get addicted on the treatment.  You really do.  On the whole nice hand-holding thing.  Why?  If you're into, you seem to be into that whole thing of the kissing and hugging.  At times, yes.  So I don't understand why you don't get a girlfriend.  Because, first of all, girlfriends don't do things as well as this girl did.  I mean, at least none I've ever had.  I mean, they're nice, but.  Right. 
[01:16:00]  And you're also paying for the instantaneous stuff you're getting.  Like the hand-holding, that's the type of girl you'd see.  You'd see her out, and you'd want to touch her or whatever, but you can't.  You understand what I mean?  That's, to me, it's not just sex.  It's the whole thing of the kissing and the whole touching of someone I shouldn't be able to kiss and touch.  The way you describe it sounds just like a serial killer talking about murder.  Like, they talk about it the same way.  It's very rational in their head.  No, no.  See, when I strangle someone, and then I disembowel them, it's because I look at them and want to do it, and you're like a crazy person. 
[01:16:30]  But, yeah, I mean, I'm addicted.  I'm definitely addicted.  Yeah, you are.  But, believe me, there's 80% or 70% of my experiences are horrendous that I've had.  Awful.  Awful.  You feel like you didn't get your money's worth?  You know, one did just terrible.  Could have just jacked it at home.  I told you.  I already told that story, but the two girls in L.A. just had so many bad ones, ones that smell, stretch marks, fats.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Just awful.  I told you one time in New Brunswick, in Jersey, I had a pregnant one in my parents' basement in the room my grandmother had lived in before a fatal heart attack.  Oh, great.  And this pregnant chick sparks up a crack pipe.  I swear to God.  Seven and a half months pregnant, she sparks up a crack pipe in my grandmother's old living room.  You've come a long way.  Yeah.  That's a true story.  A pregnant crack whore.  You don't understand the disasters I've hooked up with.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Or the awful ones I've had.  All right.  Well, that's great.  Nice.  There's the review right there. 
[01:17:30]  Very good review.  Yeah, nyconfidential.com.  And I wish I could.  For your girlfriend experiences.  I wish I could goof on it, but God damn it, I couldn't.  No.  Very happy for you, Jimmy.  Honestly, this was better than goofing on it.  This is pretty interesting.  Yeah.  I'm not giving away my free hour anymore.  And I'm normally for white girls.  Not that I'm a racist, but I normally go for white girls.  Yeah.  It's just what I like, you know, because of the whole superiority thing and the fact that we're God's people.  Well, no, it was, but he showed me this black girl that the ass was so, it was almost like, it was like a painting of an ass. 
[01:18:00]  It was so smooth and pretty.  You ever see an ass so nice it gets you angry?  Yeah, sorry.  Sorry, I was, could you get me the bell and the wacky horn?  Yeah, we need our props.  For what?  Nice picking up on those hand signals, Kev.  Let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Hey, Jason.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  Well, Jimmy, you ruined it for all of us.  Why?  I'm definitely not going for Natalia now.  Ah, that's right. 
[01:18:30]  You just took her out of the equation.  Oh.  Because, I mean, you're making it all nice and stuff, but you've told way too many stories on the show, so she's now out of the equation.  Well, I'm not clean, though.  I'm very clean.  I just got tested about three months ago.  Yeah, in three months.  Norton will call all his friends every three months and tell everybody that, you know, he passed his test.  He gets very excited.  Passed his AIDS test.  Yeah.  Well, I don't think I have AIDS.  I'm not into taking AIDS in the rump.  How many times have you called your friends to say, you know, you passed?  You get very excited on that day.  You have to.  Yeah, you always get nervous. 
[01:19:00]  Yes, Ben?  Oh, he did.  He came up to me in Boston.  He goes, dude, I just tested negative.  It was a great day.  You know, you were all excited?  Dude, I had a red ring on my chest.  Ready to go out for another three months and try again?  Yeah.  I feel like I'm failing.  Hey, maybe I'll get it next time.  I had a red ring on my chest and I thought I had one escort, actually a dominatrix who  was going to use me as a toilet, tell me she thought it was ringworm.  So I was like all panicking.  I'm like, you know, I'm a 36-year-old white guy.  I have African child disease.  Yeah, ringworm.  But I didn't.  It turned out to be an allergic reaction to laundry detergent. 
[01:19:30]  But I thought it might be AIDS.  I was panicked.  Panicked, dude.  So I went to the doctor and he tested it.  He's like, you don't have AIDS.  I'm like, just test me.  Hep, AIDS, everything I tested for.  Totally clean.  You didn't get to play Monster Rain yesterday, huh?  No, we didn't play Monster Rain.  They don't have the Monster Rain service?  No, Jason.  NY Confidential.com.  Sounds like they did.  Sounds like they did everything that you would do while playing Monster Rain.  Well, no, I think Monster Rain is with another guy, though.  All the SIG pics are flying up.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Yeah, there's, what's his name again?  Cage from whackbag.com.  You go to opianthony.com.  This guy's photoshopping as we go. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  We do a subject on the show and he's photoshopping stuff and making it very, very funny.  They got you as Prince in Purple Rain and says Monster Rain.  Very funny.  I didn't say opianthony.com to check that stuff out.  Yes, Anthony.  Instant feedback.  Norton, of course, she got wet.  Stick $1,200 under any chick's nose and tell her that an hour and many tears later, it's all hers, and see if she gets wet.  An hour and many tears later.  I really want to, I hope she's honest with us. 
[01:20:30]  I hope she's honest with us.  I think she will be.  I think she's going to give us the company line.  I really want to.  I think she'll be all nice and say, yeah, Jimmy was great.  But maybe, Jimmy, I tell you, I was packing 14 yesterday.  My rod was very lovely.  Really?  Very impressive.  Yeah.  We'll get some stuff out of her, but I think in general.  Yeah, we'll get some stuff out of her, all right?  Everything Jimmy put in her.  It's still coming out of her.  Squeeze her like a toothpaste tube.  I should come out.  Hey, Anthony, what's up? 
[01:21:00]  Not too much.  That old gag.  What's going on, bud?  Anthony from Long Island, go.  I'm here.  I'm here.  Listen, Jimmy is going to be like Robert Downey Jr. in Less Than Zero with this.  They're going to turn him into a male prostitute.  Are you saying that Jimmy gives good head and is dead?  What's that, Jim?  No, it's just a sign from Less Than Zero.  Go ahead.  It all starts off.  They're definitely turning him into a male prostitute like six months from now.  He's definitely going to be like on another website for them. 
[01:21:30]  It starts off nice.  It all starts off fine and dandy.  You think you're in control.  But eventually we're going to open up one of those doors and you're going to be on your  knees as Joseph.  Come on.  Look, let me just put my tongue in the ass.  I don't care if you're showering.  Just a second.  Nah, nah.  You owe us.  That was one of the sickest scenes in Less Than Zero.  Robert Downey Jr. is on his knees.  Oh, I saw it recently, but it was on TV and they cut that part.  He became such a drug addict that he was blowing that guy to get some, uh, so that's what happens. 
[01:22:00]  Some crack.  Ah, whatever you got to do.  Yeah.  Get a little crack.  That's going to be like you, though.  Everything was nice, but now you're going to be banging on that door every day.  Come on, man.  I need it.  I need it.  I need it, man.  Come on.  Help me out.  Could you imagine being somebody that has your addiction and doesn't have an income?  What would you, what the hell would you do if you didn't have the money to spend?  You'd be rapping old ladies over the head with bricks.  Nah, you just go online and whack your back.  It's mostly.  No, that's what Newark is for.  Five bucks? 
[01:22:30]  That's what Newark is for.  Man, I will suck your dick.  Get off the highway in Newark someday.  Yeah, that city's really becoming a great metropolis.  Anyone want a burger?  Oh, yes.  That's what Newark is for.  Get out the core.  Get out the core.  Get out the core.  Break yourself, nigga.  Break yourself.  What is that?  Love that movie.  What is that?  Menace to Society.  Oh.  Yeah, that's a great one.  I'm just hanging up on people because it's easier, so don't get insulted.  They're all like, whatever. 
[01:23:00]  I'm sure they're going,  Huff!  Huff!  I was hung up on.  Huff!  I'm insulted.  Well, I...  Well, I never!  Rob, uh, Norn already said that.  She...  Indeed!  She...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  She didn't...  She...  Yeah.  That's a trooper.  And then you kissed.  And then we...  And then you cuddled.  And then we...  Kissing, cuddling.  Was there any small talk going on?  Any, like, little small talk?  I just kept telling how beautiful she was. 
[01:23:30]  It was a nice experience, so it wasn't really much small talk, and I guess she was fighting  revulsion.  She had her face in my neck.  It was nice.  Yeah.  All right.  That's very good.  We'll get her review, hopefully, a little later when she wakes up.  Yeah, she can be honest, you know.  You know.  After she gets out of the shower that she's been taking for 24 hours with the money that  she got up in a display case, so there's a constant reminder that that's what she did it for.  There was no money.  It was just a friendly exchange between two people.  Nothing, actually.  After she gets hosed down. 
[01:24:00]  Like seeing in Planet of the Apes.  Yeah, do they have a room to hose them down after you're done with that?  It's a mad house!  A mad house!  Jesus.  Big fire hose on her back.  Right.  Trying to wash the jimmy off of her.  Let's play 1964.  Hmm.  No?  Almost.  Oh, it's still all right.  I didn't give a...  It was almost there.  That's all right.  There's still...  Set the dogs on them, too.  Okay.  No?  Well, yeah, actually. 
[01:24:30]  I don't think...  There was something there.  A little some.  We'll get it in the replay when they're more awake.  Sure.  Sure, why not?  Some of this stuff you've got to listen a second time again.  Oh, stop with the pen.  I wish you could hear the second time at night after midnight.  Oh, we're working on it.  Every day this whole experience is getting a little better, okay?  Yeah.  I'm starting to get it down there now.  All right.  Um...  Jackie.  Oh, no.  That's for another day.  Sorry.  Oh, the little notebook.  Whenever the notebook comes out, good things happen.  No, Jackie's not calling today.  That's another day. 
[01:25:00]  Um...  Oh, we should talk about Bill O'Reilly next.  Oh.  New York Times coming in.  You think Jimmy's crazy, a little perverse, and having good nights.  My God.  I just knew it, too, when he was in the O'Reilly.  The O'Reilly factor.  We'll talk about Bill O'Reilly next, and Kobe Bryant.  Holy ass.  Yeah.  All right, we got lots to do, so just let's, uh...  Kobe's chick, writing letters.  Yeah, let's step aside, and we'll return, obviously.  Duh.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony. 
[01:25:30]  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off, and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Via Village, can I help you?  Yes.  Um, may I speak to the manager, please?  Um, she's not here today.  She works Monday through Friday.  Well, maybe you can help me.  Somebody better help me.  Oh, okay, I'll try. 
[01:26:00]  Okay, now, I printed a video from your store.  Okay.  And it's for my little boy's birthday party.  Oh, heaven.  Okay, now, I got a room full of little boys, a couple little girls, about to watch this damn video.  I leave the room, I come back, and the screen ain't nothing but naked ass.  Oh, my God.  Somebody's home video is in.  This little children's movie box.  Oh, my God.  I got child protective services up my ass now, because all the parents got pissed, because they little children are seeing this mess. 
[01:26:30]  And now, they think I'm a pervert.  Oh, my Lord.  That ain't no rug rat.  I know what the rug rats look like.  Yes, ma'am.  Um, obviously, it was in the wrong case, and, um...  You know what scared me to death?  Ma'am.  Some of the kids said they already seen that movie.  Oh, my Lord.  Now, my little boy, he having nightmares all night. 
[01:27:00]  He talking about, oh, mama, the giant one-eyed snakes chasing me around the room.  Oh, Lord.  Now, first of all, the quality was poor.  The lighting was just horrible.  But let me tell you what was on there.  Now, this woman, she spread eagle, spread eagle on her back.  Hmm.  And then, this one guy, he jumped off the bedpost and, bam, right on in that thing.  Oh, my Lord.  Yeah, that looked right painful to me. 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  And then, there was another man, he was taking his penis and just smacking across the forehead.  Oh, God.  I mean, they abused that woman.  Hmm.  And he had a big old donkey dick.  I mean, that thing was about 15 inches long.  Oh, my Lord.  It looked like a daggone pornographic Cirque du Soleil up in there.  Oh, God.  Now, my son, he go, mama, can we see that movie again? 
[01:28:00]  Can we see that movie again?  Oh, God.  If you can bring that back, I can change it for anything else that you want.  Okay.  I tell you what, I'm going to bring it in there.  Maybe we can watch it together.  Because, you know, that double penetration thing, I don't get it.  Me either.  Yeah, you've got to fill up everything.  You know, leave some breathing room.  Yes, ma'am.  You're right.  I tell you, boy, you should see, look at that, look at that. 
[01:28:30]  There's my son over there humping, look at him, just humping the floor.  Look at him, humping, humping, humping.  He just, you know, he's just been humping everything now that he's seen that movie.  Hmm, all right, I'm terribly, terribly sorry.  All right, well, look, I've got to go, I've got choir practice.  Okay.  Okay, praise the Lord.  Have a nice day.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton's thing. 
[01:29:00]  Forget me not, you sightless caught, your dog just shit on my rug.  I thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  Now this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy, cause it feels so guilty without me.  I said, this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy, cause it feels so guilty without me. 
[01:29:30]  You're checking out the O-N-A virus.  Oh, it's spreading across America.  It's also spreading in this studio, if you touch Jim Norton.  The virus.  The virus.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Of course.  Big hi to everyone that turned on their XM satellite radios overnight. 
[01:30:00]  Every day.  Greetings and salutations.  People turning on their radios.  It's very, very exciting and very cool to check out.  Dave from the Bronx has a hooker story.  Hey, what's going on?  Escort.  Sorry.  Well, no, now we're talking about hookers.  Right.  That was the girlfriend experience that we had going on a little while ago.  Now we're just talking about hookers.  Yes, Dave.  Yeah, I want to give Jimmy a heads up.  I went to Amsterdam for a week to go hang out and, you know, engage in the hobby.  Right.  And I came back with the gift that keeps on giving. 
[01:30:30]  What'd you have?  A little bit of the herp, man.  Herp?  Were you careful?  Yeah, I was careful.  I put a bag on it and everything.  You don't get a little bit of the herp.  Yeah, you get a lot of bit of the herp.  But, you know, I've only had two outbreaks.  But still, man, that puts an end to everything.  Yeah, I know.  It's awful.  You got to be careful, man.  How do you know you got it there?  Oh, because I really don't mess around like that.  So I figured, let me go to Amsterdam, you know, be a little sneaky on the wife.  I'm like, you know, head over with some friends and picked up the herp. 
[01:31:00]  How do you know you didn't get it from your wife who was doing things?  I'm sorry?  How do you know your wife wasn't doing things behind your back you got from her?  That's a good question.  That's it, Jim.  Blame it on her.  He goes to bang some other chick somewhere in Amsterdam and blame it on the wife.  Yeah, I know.  Ten hokies in a week.  I probably got it from my wife.  Oh, yeah, you probably got it from the hooker.  Yeah, okay, well, you got to be careful.  Yeah, yeah, you do.  Well, it's a bit late for that now, but.  Just be careful.  Only have sex when it's an outbreak.  Jimmy, you got to get that checked for that, though, man.  Not just the AIDS.  You haven't checked for everything.  No, Jim.  Everything. 
[01:31:30]  You know.  No, Dave, this is the weird thing about Jim Norton.  He's a neat freak.  Okay.  That's what's bizarre about this.  I mean, he picks up women all the time, you know, and a lot of these girls are very,  very dirty, but then he's a neat freak, and he's checking out everything, getting tests  and this and that, so.  Yeah, I don't do, a lot of times I don't do that much with the girls, dude.  Well, yeah, I don't know.  Too many bugs.  I'm just saying.  I don't do much.  You were eating ass, my friend.  Do you know what's living back there, Jimmy?  Just my happiness. 
[01:32:00]  You know what you can get?  Yeah, I don't know.  There's all kinds of little gadgets back there and thingamabobs.  All right, quick survey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Eating ass.  Mm-hmm.  Eating ass.  Thumbs up, thumbs down.  Is there a situation where it's good?  Well, let me tell you something.  You better damn well know who you're eating ass on.  You better know.  I'm thumbs down on the eating ass.  Ah! 
[01:32:30]  I'm being honest.  It's not the matter with you two.  I'm not thumbs down on it.  I'm just, you better know who you're with and, you know.  Well, that's a, yeah, but that's kind of a thumbs horizontal.  I want a thumbs up without question.  You're ready to just grab anybody and start.  Absolutely.  See, that's, you know.  No, no, no, not anybody.  No, no, no, no, not anybody.  No, that's incorrect.  You know, there's got to be a long.  Hairy one.  There's got to be a long shower pregame going on.  That's, see, what?  I'm telling you.  Why, though? 
[01:33:00]  I don't know.  How long do you wash an apple for?  You put it under a wall?  Come on.  Relax.  You don't take a dump out of an apple.  No, unfortunately, or I'd enjoy them more.  All right.  Apple a day.  All right.  Enough with the hooker thing, I guess.  Presidential debate.  The Yankee game was on last night.  You think I was watching the important programming?  It's so funny.  You know, I read all the email that comes in.  You can email us by going to opianthony.com.  By the way, I can't write anyone back anymore.  The emails, we used to be known for writing our fans back. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, sorry.  It's gotten ridiculous.  We try, but it's gotten ridiculous.  But don't think your email's going to waste.  We read all of them.  Trust me.  We just don't answer you.  I answer as many as I can from time to time, but it's just getting out of hand.  Because then people get insulted if you don't write them back.  Do you really read all of them?  Yes, I do.  Cool.  Every single one.  And people are trying to say that we're talking politics too much on this show.  Are you kidding me?  First of all, there's a huge election coming up.  Big election coming up. 
[01:34:00]  So if we touch on it every so often, it's because it's huge in the news.  Isn't the election like three weeks away or something like that?  And we're not doing like Hannity commentary on it.  We're talking about it.  We goof on it, trying to make it a little bit funny and entertaining.  And I didn't even watch the debate, because it's the same thing now.  I was going to say, the debate was just like the other one, so why are we watching?  I watched the first one.  What was going to be different about this debate that we didn't see already?  And then I watched the town hall one, because it was a different format. 
[01:34:30]  I'm not going to watch it again.  It's the same thing.  They have their things that they've got to say, so when they're asked a question,  they don't even answer it really.  They just go on to whatever they want to, you know.  Mr. President, we have over 1,000 casualties, 1,000 dead in Iraq.  What are you going to do?  Blah, blah, blah.  Stem the tide of death.  And he winds up talking about the economy.  Well, 1,000 people dead.  It's 1,000 more jobs that we'll have in this country for people that are alive.  I'm giving you more jobs.  He should be a radio DJ. 
[01:35:00]  He knows how to seg.  The segway into whatever, yeah.  The segway into the next joke.  I love when you comedians do that, by the way.  It's awful.  I hate that.  The worst, though, is Joe Buck for baseball.  Oh, yeah.  Stop segwaying.  Holy shit.  What do you mean?  Everything's a segway with this fucking guy.  Can you just talk?  Open your mouth and words will come out, stupid.  Give me an example, though.  I'm trying to think of one.  Damn it.  You know, the days of wine and roses. 
[01:35:30]  Speaking of roses, Pete was in town.  Like, that type of shit.  Shut up.  God almighty.  Stop being so cute and professional.  It's that type of shit.  It is so aggravating.  They're trying to out-cute each other.  Al Leiter stinks.  You don't like Al Leiter in the booth?  No, I don't like Al Leiter.  I don't like him in the booth.  You don't like him talking about the pitches?  No, who cares?  It's the pitches that I get you.  Al Leiter is in the booth, and they go live to the booth with the camera,  and Al Leiter will grab the baseball and show the grip on the ball when you're throwing 
[01:36:00]  a certain type of pitch.  I thought it was kind of interesting.  That would be interesting for five seconds at a party, not on national TV.  How'd you throw that pitch?  And as he was showing me, I'd look at someone's tits as they walked by.  You know, speaking of holding the ball, do you like your balls?  Top down, do you?  Smooth operation they run over there.  Segways and pitch grips.  Oh, fuck yourselves.  Wow.  Plane Edge, check it in.  Did Norton ask her to put a little nigger in it? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, wow.  This is something we've brought up on the show in the past.  We didn't come up with this.  There was a white guy that called our show, and he was married to a lovely African-American,  and I guess at times he tells her to put a little nigger in it.  Yeah.  And that's when the girl is supposed to just really just go animalistic on it.  I'm big dick black.  Really?  Good thing we're not on terrestrial radio.  They would dump out of that.  It's not politically correct.  Certainly would.  That's offensive.  I understand.  And then some of our dopey listeners decided it was a great idea to try that at home, 
[01:37:00]  and a lot of people got slapped, I remember.  Yes.  Not something to say.  That's for sure.  I would never say that.  Why in the middle of sex do you want a girl to start stealing?  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  Wowee.  Saw the debate happen last night.  They're saying Kerry won.  I don't know.  Did he refer to terrorism as a pesky little nuisance again? 
[01:37:30]  This horse's ass?  You know, they really...  But the Republicans are really able to spin anything he says into something that really...  He'd have to be a nut job to get in front of people and say things like,  terrorism is a nuisance.  I think he was trying to hint on the fact that it would be nice to be able to get back to the point  when terrorism in this country was a nuisance,  and it wasn't something that involved everyone's life every day of the week. 
[01:38:00]  There's some type of protection against terrorism that you have to go through.  And he was looking at the, you know, remember the days when it was a nuisance?  Terrorism?  It wasn't a problem going to the airport and standing on the security line.  Now it is.  And it would be nice to be able to go back to those days.  He didn't go on and say terrorism is a nuisance.  It's like that global...  What was he saying?  I didn't watch it.  Global test.  Global test where it was twisted like he wanted to get approval from the world 
[01:38:30]  before we protect ourselves.  He didn't say that either.  The Republicans really do a good job of twisting things around.  They're great.  Don't get me wrong.  Terry is a complete horse's ass.  And I think he did say that about terrorism, though.  He said the summer cold that is also known as terrorism.  Terrorism, the summer cold, the hangnail, or terrorism.  You know, it's hard to differentiate between the two.  You know, I just don't think my life's going to change no matter who's in there. 
[01:39:00]  It really won't.  You know, that's what it comes down to.  Everyone's taking this, you know, very seriously.  And I'm sure you should.  When a new president is inaugurated in, it doesn't matter who it is.  No one's life drastically changes.  The next day, a week later, a month.  I'm still paying way too many taxes.  I'm still paying too much for everything.  I'll tell you one thing.  You will pay more taxes if Kerry's in office.  You will pay more taxes.  Something they did bring up, which they haven't before, was the religion issue.  It was actually a lot about personal religion. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, that should just not be part of the presidential election.  You're right.  Things like abortion.  Yeah.  I mean, that's huge on abortion.  I know.  That's a huge, huge subject for a lot of people in this country.  They vote based on abortion.  I mean, I think there's a few other issues that are more important and more relevant to day-to-day life than abortion, whether you're for it or against it.  It just, there are other issues that the president should be working on that are a little more important than that. 
[01:40:00]  I think picking a president is like, I don't know, picking a soda at a restaurant.  A soda.  It's as simple as this.  You go to a restaurant and you go, hey, I want a Coke.  The lady will have linguine with clam sauce.  Right.  I want a Coke.  And the waitress goes, no Coke, we have Pepsi.  So they give you the Pepsi, and for a minute or two, you're kind of bummed that you don't have a Coke in your hands, because you kind of like Coke just a little bit more than Pepsi. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, Red, you eat here.  I love this place.  I come for the strudel.  Right.  But then in the end, you have the Pepsi, and the meal is just as good, so you kind of forget that you're drinking Pepsi instead of Coke.  Yeah, you never think about it the whole time, going, oh, I hate this Pepsi.  So it's like, you know, I want Kerry.  I do.  If it comes down to, I want Kerry.  If they give me Bush, eh, I'll be kind of bummed for a little bit, but you know what?  The meal's still going to be okay.  It's still going to wash the burger down. 
[01:41:00]  It's still going to be whatever.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's not that much different when I look at it.  It's not.  No.  Nothing really changes.  Small things change.  Things like taxes change.  It's a big thing.  That is a big thing.  Dude, always.  I'm tired of forking money over.  I get annoyed that liberals always want more money.  I might have to vote for Bush just out of my own selfishness.  It's like enough with taking money and just giving it away.  So Bush gets into office and we're going to be paying, you know. 
[01:41:30]  You do pay less.  Yeah, we're going to be paying that much less that we're going to be able to really enjoy ourselves?  Yes.  Hell fucking no.  Dude, you will pay a lot more taxes under Kerry.  It's not about me.  I could write that check.  I don't care.  I'm voting for personal reasons.  It's about...  I want to keep some of my money.  Well, people say, well, you should vote for global reasons.  Well, then why do you have one person, one vote?  You vote for your own interest.  You have to.  I do.  I'm selfish.  We're talking about regular Joe Schmo.  Is he going to notice the difference in his taxes, that he's going to be able to go on 
[01:42:00]  a better vacation or buy better stuff at Best Buy?  Probably not.  That's what I'm saying.  Probably not.  They talk about more taxes if you vote for Kerry.  How much more?  It's like a billion dollar tax cut.  How much does that work out for every man, woman, and child?  You're going to pay an extra dollar.  It's an extra couple of bucks a year.  It's never a drastic change where the average person will be able to enjoy the benefits of that.  It's just not.  How many hookers does that work out to for your tax cuts? 
[01:42:30]  It really depends on what the percentage offers.  That was my good improv skills.  It really depends on what the percentage offers.  It just made no sense.  I threw in something that related to money, which was percentage.  God almighty.  What a witless nothing.  Yeah, well, it all depends on how many dead presidents.  All right.  There you go.  Good one.  We spent five minutes on the election, okay?  Yeah, because I didn't watch the debate.  No.  I was supposed to.  It was like an assignment we had to do. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  We're taping something today.  And for something after the show, I was supposed to watch that.  We'd like to talk about that, but we don't want to ruin that.  Yeah, don't want to ruin it.  Because we don't know what our relationship is with that fine company over there.  Right.  And they are a fine company.  That's right.  Ooh.  Uh, let's see.  Bush carry.  Oh, look.  It's like choosing between Coke and Pepsi.  There we go.  Now, put the pen down.  I'm trying.  All right.  I'm just going to remind you.  I'm not banging as much.  Isolate that clip. 
[01:43:30]  Lord knows that's the truth.  Ah.  Anyway.  See.  Do we get into the Bill O'Reilly thing now?  Bill O'Reilly.  Bill O'Reilly.  Hope to see you again next time.  Remember, the spin stops here because we are looking out for you.  Mmm.  And we're looking out for you.  Yeah, Bill O'Reilly is obviously the big, huge story today.  Yes.  Grab that dildo.  What a tool.  Man, if this stuff. 
[01:44:00]  It looks like the dildo was spinning.  The drill-do.  We don't use a drill-do because it's a no-spin zone.  Allegedly.  The O'Reilly factor.  Allegedly.  Yes.  I don't know.  I mean, I can't wait to see how Bill's going to talk his way out of this one.  My talking points.  I will discuss how this is all false.  He's being accused of sexual harassment on the job with one of his producers.  That's the accusation. 
[01:44:30]  The producer has filed a suit.  Bill O'Reilly says it's nothing but a shakedown, extortion.  They're trying to get $60 million out of him, and that's the only reason they're doing this.  And he is completely innocent.  He will be exonerated.  And we will all find out that this is a bunch of bunk and malarkey, if I may use such harsh language on satellite radio.  But it looks like Bill O'Reilly might have been affected by these shock jocks. 
[01:45:00]  I'm reading the complaints that are influencing the children of America.  The complaint is classic.  I can't wait.  Tomorrow we'll bring in our Bill O'Reilly interview.  This guy railed us.  We talked to him for over an hour, and he cut up our piece to make us look like just sex peddlers.  It's all about the sex with you guys, isn't it?  It's all about, come on, just admit it, it's about the sex.  I was like, you know, Bill, this is about a just guy, it's a guy-related show. 
[01:45:30]  The guys like listening to it.  The best quote, you look at Bill O'Reilly and go, Bill, you know what guys like?  You know what guys like, Bill?  He goes, why the sex?  It's like, Bill, you know what guys like?  And you laughed.  Well, apparently he absolutely knows what guys like.  Allegedly.  We don't know what's true or not true here.  I will say, according to the complaint.  According to the complaint that happens to be on every website in America.  Oh, my God.  And in every newspaper in America.  If this is proven true, he is done. 
[01:46:00]  Good.  He is done.  Good.  You don't like the Bill O'Reilly?  I can't stand him, because of the chop job he did on you guys.  You're not Walter Cronkite, douchebag.  He comes off as a pompous, thinks he's a know-it-all.  He was on A Current Affair.  Remember that show?  Yeah.  He wants people to forget that.  That's shock TV.  He was salacious in his day.  Yeah.  I'm wondering if Tom Brokaw is here to read the headlines of the story.  Oh, really? 
[01:46:30]  I don't know if we have the NBC Nightly News theme yet.  Probably not.  That would be asking for too much from our behind-the-scenes staff.  Bill O'Reilly, a fellow journalist.  In trouble.  Although Sex Bagel is a little more spry today.  I'll say.  Maybe he had a good night's sleep after.  Looks like he might have gotten another alarm clock after he lied to us yesterday.  He seems a little more spry.  A little more spring in his step.  A little more spring in his step, running around, handing all sorts of things in. 
[01:47:00]  He might have seen all the resumes that were handed to us at the beginning of the show for his job.  People asking for jobs.  What's wrong, Sex Bagel?  Oh, nothing.  Ben said come in here.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, no.  We were just noticing that you were a little more spry today.  Yes.  You got some sleep yesterday?  Did you get another alarm clock?  I should have got four.  So, they're all over the...  Four alarm clocks.  And you're not going to lie to us anymore?  Because I know you lied to us yesterday.  That's why we sent you home.  There was not a fire alarm.  No, not a fire alarm.  The smoke detector went off.  The battery just went dry and I ripped it out. 
[01:47:30]  Didn't you say fire alarm?  It was a fire alarm.  When I called Ben, I was in a panic.  The fire thing went off in my house.  I got to go.  And I hung up.  So, the smoke detector went off.  And what did that do?  Didn't you say you went outside, right?  You went outside?  The what?  Didn't you say you went outside?  But how is that...  How could you be late because something is waking you up earlier than the alarm clock?  What happened?  Because that's the only thing that could happen there.  Right.  Or did you sleep through the alarm clock but the smoke detector woke you up?  No.  Two separate instances from the night.  The smoke detector went off about 1230.  The battery was just never replaced. 
[01:48:00]  So, I yanked the battery and went out.  I went back to sleep.  Then I was chipping golf balls until the limo driver came.  All right.  Let's just drop it.  All right.  You're looking a little more spry today.  Yes.  Do we have the NBC theme music?  We're finding it right now.  Oh, man.  All right.  All right.  We'll have to...  We'll get that.  Well, we can start.  All right?  Yeah.  Bill O'Reilly, accusations of sexual harassment by Andrea Macris, who is an ex-producer on The  O'Reilly Factor and his radio show.  Let me tell you something.  The producers at The O'Reilly Factor are wild. 
[01:48:30]  Well, we know of another one that is absolutely out of her mind wild.  One chick that was hanging out with us for a while during the time where we were supposed  to be doing the interview with Bill O'Reilly.  Right.  This whole O'Reilly interview that we did, we didn't want to do it for the longest time.  And then they sent this producer to hang out with us.  She was nuts.  Remember her?  She was out of her mind.  Slot machine?  Yeah.  The ex-surfer.  We actually had a beer fight with her when the Fox cameras were rolling. 
[01:49:00]  There was a picture taken under a desk of her genitalia.  Were they nice?  With a tampon string coming out of it.  I have a picture of a producer from, I don't know if she was a part-time producer or she  still works there.  I have no idea.  No, she does.  But she was hanging out with us for a long time to try to butter us up to get us in front  of O'Reilly.  And she started drinking with us and hanging out with us.  And she was getting info also to give to O'Reilly so he could ask questions.  And then we did this huge thing at the Hard Rock Cafe because there was a time we were 
[01:49:30]  in like five or six magazines at the same time.  So we had like a weird magazine signing party.  Oh, what did I say?  Hard Rock?  Yeah.  Well, Hard Rock is always good to us.  So I always think Hard Rock.  It was the Hooters.  And we're there and it turned out to be a huge beer fight with this chick.  And the cameras were rolling for Fox.  They didn't show any of that footage because she was supposed to be a very responsible producer.  So her producer involved in a beer fight.  She would come back hammered to the office.  She snotted, smashed, hammered drunk.  She went back to the office with Stinky and sat at Opie's desk.  Didn't they like have a little thing going for a little while? 
[01:50:00]  She had marker writings.  Someone took a Sharpie and was writing all over the inside of her thigh and all that.  And she was supposedly so serious with Bill O'Reilly.  Yeah, and there was like stuff written on the arm made in Taiwan.  Wow.  All right.  We'll get to that because that is the freakiest thing ever.  So she's hanging out with us for a long time.  And I had a camera at my desk where I took celebrity photos.  Yeah.  Like Jimmy does and stuff.  A cool celebrity comes in. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, I want to get a little picture, you know?  Yeah.  She decided to take my camera after one of these drunken nights.  And it was, this is not even allegedly.  This girl loved to drink with us.  And she started taking pictures of her snatch.  Under the desk.  Under the desk.  Like she would take a picture of her snatch, you know, up her skirt.  And we got the pictures developed because it was just a stupid disposable.  We were like, oh my God, what is this?  And she was having that time of the month.  I think Steve from foundrymusic.com still has those pictures somewhere on that site.  And there's a picture of her snatch with the string hanging out of her panties. 
[01:51:00]  And the marker on the legs.  And the marker on the legs and stuff.  So we were hanging out with this girl for weeks.  And she's very hot.  I don't even want to mention her name.  Although what I'm about to say is going to give it away, unfortunately.  And we're doing pre-interviews.  She's going to lunch with us.  She's in the studio like Big Kev is there.  Just hanging out, okay?  We go to this, we go to Hooters for the magazine signing party.  And all of a sudden I'm at the, I'm up front with Ann. 
[01:51:30]  We're signing autographs, me and our fans.  Whatever, doing our thing.  All of a sudden I look over to Ben.  And Ben is in a panic, freaked out.  And I'm like, uh-oh, Ben just noticed something.  What the hell's going on?  So Ben's way off in the corner and he's trying to get my attention.  And we lock eyes.  And I'm like, dude, what?  Because we have the secret language that we do on the show.  All of a sudden he goes like this.  Pretty much like when the coach comes out to the mound and goes, let's go to the lefty. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  And goes like this.  Taps the arm.  Taps the arm like, let's go to the lefty.  Freaking Ben from the corner is going like that.  I go, what does that mean?  And then he's like moving his eyes over to this producer from The O'Reilly Factor.  Yeah.  The dude, the chick has a fake arm.  Jim was actually the one that pointed it out.  And we hadn't noticed for weeks.  She had a mannequin arm with a bracelet on it, okay?  Yeah.  And the point I'm trying to make is like, we were hanging out with this girl for two weeks  and not one of us didn't notice that the girl only had one arm until that night. 
[01:52:30]  We're like, holy, and it freaked everybody out.  We'd make great witnesses, wouldn't we?  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Yeah, she held up both hands and made fists and flipped me the bird with both hands.  Played patty cakes.  And then all of a sudden, then I tapped Anthony and I went, you know how you do that?  Yeah.  It's over there.  And I didn't want to look.  And then everyone else associated with the show, we were just stupefied. 
[01:53:00]  Like, none of us noticed that the girl had one arm?  Just pointing and giggling hysterically.  Oh, yes, we are.  Five creeps.  Immature.  It was unbelievable.  So, anyway, back to the O'Reilly story.  O'Reilly.  Yeah, Andrea Macris, the ex-producer, filed a suit against Bill O'Reilly,  saying that he sexually harassed her with explicit language, phone calls, sexual deviancy.  Anyway, there's some really, really great lines here. 
[01:53:30]  The pages, there's about ten pages.  You want me to just read a little bit from the post and then...  No, this is good stuff.  Oh, this is better than the post?  The post is going to cut it out.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Bill O'Reilly said to plaintiff Andrea Macris,  and just use a vibrator to blow off steam.  Talking about how she should have some sex with a vibrator when she doesn't have a boyfriend.  So, she could blow off some steam.  When the plaintiff Redden defended Bill O'Reilly, asked lewdly, 
[01:54:00]  What?  You've got a vibrator, don't you?  Every girl does.  When the plaintiff responded indignantly,  No, no.  Not every girl does.  Does your wife?  The defendant replied,  Yes, in fact, she does.  She'd kill me if she knew I was telling you.  Wait, so where did this conversation begin?  This was taking place when they were out to dinner.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Apparently, they took a lot of dinners together.  Okay.  See, I'm not sure this was as much sexual harassment. 
[01:54:30]  I'm not defending Bill O'Reilly,  but I think this chick was going out to a lot of dinners with Bill O'Reilly,  and probably didn't, this wasn't a problem for her.  That's what it seems like.  This happened a lot.  But it does seem like, from this report,  that Bill O'Reilly was saying stuff like this.  I wouldn't put it past him.  I just don't think she was that upset by it.  Something then probably happened.  She decided she's going to pull all this stuff up now  and use it in a sexual harassment.  Because when it comes down to it, we're all guys.  Right. 
[01:55:00]  These asses go on TV and act like they're different  and they don't have the same feelings that we do.  Yeah.  You know?  During the course of their dinner in early May of 2002,  Bill O'Reilly informed Andrea Macris  that he had advised another woman to purchase a vibrator  and had taught the woman how to masturbate  while telling her sexual stories over the telephone.  So Bill O'Reilly, from this report,  seems to be very into phone sex.  Likes the phone sex. 
[01:55:30]  And on the no-spin zone.  Defendant O'Reilly then boasted that the woman  had her first orgasm via masturbation  as he spoke to her on the phone.  Have you ever watched this guy's show?  Could you see anything sexual  or anything a woman would listen to?  Let's talk about Carrie.  John Carrie.  Hello, you're masturbating to the O'Reilly factor.  Put that dildo in you.  You're in the no-spin zone.  So just put it in and out. 
[01:56:00]  Actually, this is the spin zone.  When the plaintiff responded  that she never engaged in phone sex,  defendant Bill O'Reilly professed disbelief  and told her that the sexual stories  he told were all based upon his own experiences.  Such as when he received a message  in a cabana in Bali  that the little short brown woman  asked to see his penis  and was, quote, amazed.  Defendant Bill O'Reilly then suggested  that he tell plaintiff  the same sexual stories  which she knew  which he knew she would just love. 
[01:56:30]  He apparently believes  women love these stories.  He talks about his big penis  and how women are amazed by it.  Shocked and embarrassed,  she informed the defendant.  In no uncertain terms,  she was neither experienced  or interested in gaining experience  in telephone sex.  Bill O'Reilly responded suggestively,  stick with me and I'll take care of you, 
[01:57:00]  winked and walked into his hotel room.  He just, you could picture him  carrying himself around.  Hey, sweetie.  Hey, toots, you stick with me.  During a week of March 19th through 13th  of 2000, March 9th through 13th, 2003,  Bill O'Reilly joined Andrea Macris  and another staff member  at the Peninsula Hotel for cocktails.  Andrea Macris' college friend was with her.  O'Reilly approached the two 
[01:57:30]  and commented,  University of Missouri, boy,  I would have had fun with you two  and alluded to having a menage a trois  with the plaintiff and her friend.  During the course of the dinner,  O'Reilly repeatedly propositioned the women,  singing the praises of telephone sex,  offering to telephone them both  and suggesting that the three of them,  quote, go to a hotel together  and have the time of their lives.  O'Reilly further suggested  that the women needed to be trained 
[01:58:00]  so they'd be equipped and ready to go  when, quote, real men showed up in their lives  and offered, quote, lessons.  Bill O'Reilly, masturbation lessons.  It's my masturbation points  on The Factor.  Yes.  Let's go to Shepard Smith in Studio B  and have him stick a dildo in his ass.  Wow.  Defendant Bill O'Reilly  regaled plaintiff and her friend 
[01:58:30]  with stories concerning the loss  of his virginity in a car  with a girl in a car at JFK.  Two really wild Scandinavian airline stewardesses.  He had gotten together with a girl  at a sex show in Thailand  who had shown him things in the back room  that, quote, blew his mind.  If you're in a back room in Thailand,  you're pretty kinky.  Right, Jim?  You would know, right?  I've never been to Thailand,  but I imagine that they're all very young 
[01:59:00]  and it's an awful place.  People don't go to Thailand  because there's a Thailand Disney.  You know?  You go to Thailand  to have sex with young boys  and young girls.  That's why you go.  I've got a flight booked for next week.  And you just kind of contradicted yourself.  That does make it like Disney.  It kind of is.  Why else would you go there if you're an adult?  It's a small anus after all.  And no one gives it away.  If you go more than once,  that's what gives it away.  Right.  Because you can almost say, 
[01:59:30]  no, you know,  I was into the Vietnam War thing.  Right.  And the history,  and I wanted to check out  some of the tunnels,  this and that.  No, I went there.  It's a very interesting culture.  But you go back more than once,  you're going back.  Go to the tie stick factory.  Yeah, you're going for more than just  a history lesson.  The defendant then stated  he was going to Italy  to meet the Pope.  And his pregnant wife  was staying at home  with his daughter.  And implied he was looking forward  to some extra marital affair  with the hot Italian women. 
[02:00:00]  So he would just tell this lady  all these stories?  All these stories.  During the course of dinner,  again, see,  they went out to dinner a lot.  If this girl was so offended by this,  she says it was just to keep her job.  But you wouldn't be going  to so many dinners.  During the course of another dinner,  defendant once again  raised the specter of telephone sex,  repeatedly professing disbelief  that the plaintiff  had never engaged in telephone sex.  Defendant O'Reilly  repeatedly begged the plaintiff 
[02:00:30]  to have telephone sex with him  that night.  And the plaintiff kept refusing.  Then he...  This is where it gets good.  Real good.  Yeah.  He threatened her in a way  saying that if any woman...  Because he had apparently  done this with other women  that worked for him.  And he said,  if any woman ever breathe a word,  I'll make her pay so dearly  she'd wish she'd never been born.  I'll rake her through the mud,  bring up things in her life  that make her so miserable  she'll be destroyed.  And besides, 
[02:01:00]  she wouldn't be able  to afford the lawyers  I can  or endure it financially  as long as I can.  And nobody would believe her.  Me or some unstable...  Oh, they wouldn't believe  some unstable woman  making outrageous accusations.  This is kind of a good...  It's kind of a good way  of her trying to get him  by saying he said these things  because this is exactly  what he's going to try to do.  You know?  It's hard to know 
[02:01:30]  who to believe in this,  but I pretty much believe  he said this stuff.  I just don't think  she was that offended by it.  It's just making me  like him more.  So why did she...  Yeah, you know?  Why didn't she bring this to light?  Did something happen  that got her so pissed off  that she said,  you know what?  Because she lost her job.  She lost her job.  And he's saying...  Is there a tape or not?  There's supposed to be  taped phone calls.  Taped phone calls.  Which, yeah,  that would be huge.  Where's the really...  Here it is.  On or about August 2nd, 2004. 
[02:02:00]  Now we're really getting  up to date.  Defendant O'Reilly  telephoned the plaintiff  at her home  after interviewing  two porn stars  on The O'Reilly Factor.  Yes, porn stars.  Apparently O'Reilly  was excited from the show.  With little preamble,  defendant Bill O'Reilly  launched into a vile  and degrading monologue  about sex.  During the course  of O'Reilly's  telephone monologue,  he suggested the plaintiff  purchase a vibrator  and name it...  Name it...  Little O'Reilly. 
[02:02:30]  The private vibrator's name  is Charlene, sir!  I'm Bill O'Reilly.  Hope to see you again next time.  Remember,  the spin stops here  because we are  looking out for you.  We're looking out  for your vagina.  And that he had one.  He had a vibrator  of his own,  shaped like a cock  shaped like a cock  with a little battery in it  that a woman  had given him.  It became apparent  to the plaintiff  that the defendant  O'Reilly  was masturbating  as he spoke. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, God!  After he climaxed,  defendant O'Reilly  said to the plaintiff,  I appreciate the fun call.  You can have fun tonight.  I'll appreciate it.  I mean it.  So he was jacking  on the phone.  Wow.  He kept calling her,  saying that they should  have phone sex,  suggesting that  she come to  his hotel room  and have sex with him. 
[02:03:30]  Bill O'Reilly  on another occasion  once again launched  into a lewd and  lascivious,  unsolicited,  and disturbingly  sexually graphic talk.  Defendant O'Reilly  informed plaintiff  Andrea Macris  that he was watching  a porn movie  and babbled  perversely  regarding his fantasies  concerning Caribbean  vacations because  purportedly,  quote,  once people get into  that hot weather  they should shed  their inhibitions.  You know,  they drink during  the day,  they lay there  and all lazy,  they have dinner, 
[02:04:00]  and then they come  back and fool around.  That's basically  the modus operandi.  During the course  of the monologue,  defendant O'Reilly  further stated,  he would like to  take a shower  with her right away  and would be the  first to think  to do so.  We'd check into  the room.  He described what  he wanted to do  with her.  We'd check into  the room and we  would order up  some room service  and you'd definitely  get two wines into  you as quickly as  possible.  I could get you,  I could get into 
[02:04:30]  you,  maybe intravenously  I'd get that wine  into you.  He's talking about  getting her drunk.  You would basically  be in the shower,  I would come in  and I'd join you  and you would have  your back to me  and I would take  the little loofah  thing and kind of  soap up your back.  You know,  you'd feel the  tension drain out  of you.  And you still  would be with  your back to me  and I would kind  of put my arm,  it's one of those  little mitts, 
[02:05:00]  these loofah mitts,  you know,  so I got my hands  in it and I would  put it around front  kind of rubbing  your tummy a little  bit with it.  Then with my other  hand I would start  to massage your  boobs,  get your nipples  really hard  because I like  that.  And you have  really spectacular  boobs.  So anyway,  I'd be rubbing  your big boobs  and getting your  nipples really hard,  kind of kissing  your neck from  behind.  Then I'd take  the other hand  with the falafel 
[02:05:30]  thing.  What's a falafel  thing?  I don't know,  one of those  things that removes  skin when you're  in the shower,  right?  It's kind of like  the loofah,  no?  Yeah.  And I'd put it  on your pussy.  All right,  I gotta stop you.  How do they got  this much detail?  This is what she  says he said to  her.  Is this possibly  a transcript of  a phone call?  Could be a transcript  of a phone call  because it sounds  conversational,  right,  with all the  uhs and  ahs in it.  Oh my God,  if they have a  tape of this,  he is so finished. 
[02:06:00]  But I do want to  interject that Bill  Reilly is awful  at phone sex.  I want to smooch  with you a little  bit and then put  on the loofah  glove.  I'll put on a  loofah glove.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Rub your boobs.  Who says that,  you idiot?  Say tits.  Yeah,  I want to kiss  you where the sun  don't shine.  Elbow,  elbow.  I'd put it in  on your pussy,  but you'd have  to do it,  but I'd have to  do it real light,  just kind of teasing,  just kind of a tease  business. 
[02:06:30]  He didn't say that.  He did say that.  A tease business.  Yeah.  Good.  Andrea Macris was  frightened and  disturbed,  she says.  During the course  of this monologue,  defendant O'Reilly  suggested that he  would perform oral  sex on plaintiff  Andrea Macris.  What a guy.  How did he phrase it?  I'll kiss you  where the baby  comes out?  And that she  would start to  perform fellatio  upon his,  quote,  big cock,  but not complete  the sex act.  Quote,  you'd tease me  like you wouldn't 
[02:07:00]  really do it.  You just like,  because I know  you,  you're like a tease.  Yeah,  this is too  conversational.  Oh,  please.  Can I just,  I'm not very  religious,  but God,  please,  please let  these tapes  exist and  please let them  get out.  I want to hear  this.  During the  course of his  perverted ravings,  defendant O'Reilly  told plaintiff that  they would engage  in sexual intercourse.  And during his  sexual rant,  it became clear  that defendant O'Reilly 
[02:07:30]  was using a vibrator  upon himself  and that he  ejaculated.  Plaintiff was  repulsed.  I'm Bill O'Reilly.  Hope to see you  again next time.  Remember,  the spin stops here  because we are  looking out for you.  Immediately after  climaxing,  defendant O'Reilly  launched into a  discussion concerning  how good he was  during his recent  appearance on  The Tonight Show.  What an ass.  What a complete  ass.  What an ass.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  yeah.  Oh,  oh. 
[02:08:00]  Hey,  did you catch  Leno last night?  I was great on it,  wasn't I?  He said,  was he looking at  his muscles in the  mirror as he's  doing this?  Like an American  psycho?  With his quilt,  quickly wilting  big cock.  Was there a Huey  Lewis in the news  plane in the  background?  What a creep.  He is slowly  drying to the  consistency of  potato flakes on  his stomach.  Was he talking  about why he  likes Phil Collins  so much? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  I use a facial  scrub every morning.  Right,  right,  right,  right.  The Tonight Show  with DJ Leno,  he says,  quote,  it was funny.  They used a big  clip of me right  after Brokaw.  And Brokaw is  absolutely the most  unfunny guy in the  world.  And the audience  got a big charge  out of me.  It was good.  This is definitely  a tape conversation.  Yeah.  No woman would  make up a big  charge.  That's something an  older man says.  And you don't take  on a lawsuit like  this unless you got  your freaking shit 
[02:09:00]  She has tape  of this sanctimonious  jerk-off.  Tom Brokaw,  NBC Nightly News.  I'd like to rebut  a little bit here.  I'm pretty handy  with a dillzo myself.  And I occasionally  like vibrating  butt pull-  butt pull-  backdoor small  little vibrators.  I occasionally  like using those.  Actually,  I insert one  during NBC  Nightly News.  It keeps me alert  and awake  for some of 
[02:09:30]  the boring news.  After climaxing  Defendant O'Reilly  again boasted  that none of the  women he'd engage  in sexual relations  would ever tell.  Nobody'd believe  him, he said.  They wouldn't tell  anyway.  I can't imagine  any of them  ever doing that  because I'd always  made friends  with women  before I  bedded them down.  Bedding them  down.  The dames.  I can't wait  to get our interview  on the air tomorrow.  Defendant O'Reilly  concluded stating  you know, 
[02:10:00]  Macris,  in these days  of your celibacy  and your hibernation  this is good  for you to have  a little fantasy outlet.  You know,  just keep it  tuned.  Keep that sensuality  tuned until  Mr. Wright  comes along  and you can put  him in traction.  I'm telling you,  this is good  for your mental health.  Where's my  porno music?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  On or about  September 21st,  2004.  Now we're talking  only a month ago.  Defendant O'Reilly  telephoned plaintiff  once again 
[02:10:30]  without invitation  or solicitation  and launched  into yet another  disgusting,  lewd,  and disturbing  monologue  concerning his  sexual fantasies  with her  until he climaxed.  During the course  of the call,  O'Reilly said  to the plaintiff,  quote,  next time you'll  come up to my  hotel room  and we'll make  this happen.  Plaintiff felt  frightened and threatened.  Can this dumb  bitch ever say  I'm busy,  can I call you back?  She just sits there  on the phone  while he whacks his bag  with a thing  in his hiney.  You know what?  She sits there  and tapes it.  And tapes it.  You think he had  the thing in his...  Yes.  You think he was 
[02:11:00]  shoving it up his butt  and jacking?  Or against his  Vaz Deverns,  the ball vein.  He probably had it  vibrating against  his thick Irish ball vein.  Wow.  I mean,  that is some...  Anthony,  you missed one quote.  Oh, I did.  Okay.  Yeah,  I don't know  what paper this was in.  It says,  I would like to add  this exact wording,  which was...  This was Bill O'Reilly  to this producer.  Yeah.  Do you like it  when a black motherfucker 
[02:11:30]  comes on your face?  Wait a minute.  Wait,  I think you've gotten  the wrong transcript,  Opie.  What?  No,  this was in my  Bill O'Reilly part pile.  I think I got mixed up  with another  smokinggun.com  transcript.  Look,  here's all my  Bill O'Reilly stuff  and it says,  do you like it  when a black motherfucker  comes on your face?  No,  I think  your files  are off.  That's from  the Kobe Bryant  debacle.  Oh,  I'm sorry. 
[02:12:00]  This was  Kobe's  victim.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  You're sorry.  That's all so confusing.  Kobe's  victim  wrote a letter  to police  saying that  she was apologizing  for leaving  a couple of things  out  inadvertently.  one of the things  she left out  was the fact  that she  hadn't washed  her face  after the  incident. 
[02:12:30]  There was  some DNA  on her face,  some Kobe  cream  on her face.  Is this her  actual letter?  Yeah,  this is all in  her handwriting  and everything.  Because it says,  during my rape,  Mr. Bryant asked  me a very degrading  comment.  I would like  to add his  exact wording,  which was,  do you like it  when a black  mother effer  comes on your  face?  Yeah.  While it was  difficult to  talk about this,  I wanted my  statement to be  the truth.  The other thing  is that when I  was finally able  to pry his  hands off my  neck, 
[02:13:00]  when I turned  around,  he had his  hands in the  air like  someone would  when a cop  asked them to  put their  hands in the  air.  Like he  backed off,  like let go  of her,  backed off,  and went,  hey,  what?  What happened?  I thought we were  all just having  fun here.  I thought you  liked this.  Hey, hey.  I thought you  liked this,  huh?  I was just  trying to keep  my cum from  dripping down  onto your  shirt.  That's why I  put my hands  around your  neck,  to catch it  dripping off  of your face.  Hey, you  didn't blink twice.  I thought we  were just  having fun here.  She didn't  answer the  question,  though.  Does she  indeed like  it when a  black motherfucker  comes on  her face,  or does she 
[02:13:30]  not?  Is that a rhetorical  question that  Kobe was asking,  or was he  expecting an  answer to that?  Probably talking  to himself.  How do you  answer a  question like  that?  Well, it's  funny you  asked that.  Do you like  when a black  motherfucker  comes on  your face?  We'll answer  that when we  come back  from this  break on  The O'Reilly  Factor,  the no spin  zone.  I'm Bill O'Reilly.  Hope to see you  again next time.  Remember,  the spin stops  here,  because we  are looking  out for you.  Not the spin  of him cupping  and rotating  his balls in  his hand as  he jacks it  on the phone.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  According to  these reports.  These reports 
[02:14:00]  are just  everywhere.  He's saying  that it's just  her trying to  extort 60  it is maybe  a woman scorned  a little bit.  Something happened.  Or maybe she  did figure out,  hey, you know,  I can make some  money by suing him.  We'll get to the  bottom of this.  I mean, if there's  a tape out there  though,  guess who will  get to play it?  We will.  That's what's great  about satellite radio.  You know what's  really interesting?  As a young boy, 
[02:14:30]  you know what  he used to play?  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain  on The O'Reilly  Factor.  Me and  Shepard Smith  will be under  the porch.  Spend an hour  afterwards wiping  his makeup off  my thighs.  We got to get  on The Factor.  We'll get our  interview with  Bill O'Reilly  hopefully on the  show tomorrow  because this guy  went after us  hard.  Really hard.  Hard.  Goes after everyone  hard, apparently,  from reading the  transcript.  All right.  Stephen Lynch is 
[02:15:00]  here, also the  New York Times  reporter.  The New York Times  reporter could come  in any time because  we kind of screwed up  yesterday.  We want to make  sure he feels at  home today.  Feels welcome.  Feels welcome.  Always welcome.  Hey, Tia.  Where are you  calling from, Tia?  Tennessee.  Tennessee.  Tennessee.  Nice.  How did you  discover the O.P.  at Anthony's show?  My husband has an  XM radio.  All right.  So you're new  listeners or old  listeners that are  rediscovering us?  New.  Wow. 
[02:15:30]  Brand new listeners.  We love the brand  new listeners.  We love the brand  new listeners.  Spread the virus to  your friends if you're  enjoying what you're  hearing, okay?  Okay.  All right.  So what do you want  to do today on the  show?  I wanted to play  Guess What's in  Your Pants.  All right.  Guess What's in  Your Pants on The  Factor.  What's it?  Yeah, I bet it's a  big vibrating dildo.  Shaped just like my  big cock, Bill O'Reilly.  Well, I think we  should play Guess  What's in My Pants  today.  Of course we should.  Why not?  We're not the  factor. 
[02:16:00]  All right, here's  the song.  Second.  Yes.  It's time to play.  Yeah.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's  in my pants.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's  in my pants.  Hold on, Tia.  All right, we're  going to play Guess  What's in My Pants.  Your job, Tia, is to  take that telephone and  rub it on your area down  there, and we will guess  what type of hairstyle you  have based solely on the 
[02:16:30]  sound coming from the  telephone.  Please don't tell us what  you have in your pants  until we ask you after  everyone has guessed.  Well, we've got to know  a little something about  Tia.  Of course we do.  Tia, what do you look  like?  I'm blonde, blue-eyed.  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  Okay, so is Opie.  You're not doing anything  for us yet.  Help us out a little  more.  Come on.  Five foot one, and I  have 40D.  40D?  Well, I like big butt, and I 
[02:17:00]  cannot lie.  No, how much, well, how much  do you weigh?  Tia?  130.  5-1-130.  Get your chart up here.  Oh, boy.  Get the chart.  It's okay.  We're just playing guess  what's in my pants.  Yes.  5-1-130.  Oof, that's stretching the  limit.  Is it?  Yeah, it's in range.  But she's got big boobs.  5-1-40-D.  40-D.  She's got big boobs.  It could be... 
[02:17:30]  Well, see, I've got to  explain something.  40 is starting to talk...  You're talking about big  back, Ed.  Yeah.  A lot of people think, like,  40 means bigger boobs.  No, it's the...  Cup size.  It's the letter that does  that.  D means, yeah, she's got  big boobs.  40 is.  40 means that it's displayed  on a bigger surface.  Do you have a big back?  No.  No?  I didn't say huge.  It's just...  It's up there a little bit.  When watching Bugs Bunny 
[02:18:00]  cartoons, do the children  ever see the Tasmanian  devil and point and go,  look, mommy's on  television.  No.  Let it be known, the  New York Times reporter  is chuckling a little bit.  Just a little bit.  All right.  So, Tia, all right.  5-1-130-40-Ds.  Okay.  Where are you?  Tennessee.  No, I mean, in a house,  in a car.  Huh?  Where are you?  House, the car?  In the house.  In the house.  You're all alone? 
[02:18:30]  No, my husband's  sitting over here.  Oh, there you go.  And how old are you?  35.  35?  Because that influences  the decision here, Anthony.  It does.  As a woman gets older,  the hair gets a little  more coarse down there.  Hey, it's kind of like  having an old house.  After a while, eh.  Yeah.  You don't need to paint  the shutters as much anymore.  Right.  The hedges aren't as  finely manicured out in front.  Yeah, you don't break out  that edger from the garage as much.  Yeah, not as much.  The house is getting a little  older.  My company's coming over.  We'll edge down the sidewalk 
[02:19:00]  a little bit.  They understand.  The house has been there a while.  They saw it when it was younger.  Right.  Grind builds up.  You don't know how bad it smells  until people come over.  Right.  After a while,  you can't put another  coat of paint on the house.  No.  Because now you're just,  you know,  there's just too many layers of paint.  That's all.  That's all we're trying to say.  If you think about it, really?  The piping might be  a little more leaky.  A little leaky?  A little bit.  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  You know.  But it's still a functional house.  And the backyard's been unkempt  for a while. 
[02:19:30]  Sure.  You know,  you probably can't even get  in the back door anymore.  Right.  So much junk piled up there.  You start storing stuff there.  Right.  You get the new house,  you're really motivated,  you get the gardener  to come over once a week  to mow the lawn.  Keep everything trimmed.  Older house,  once every two weeks  we'll do the job.  You let it go.  Sometimes the vegetation  starts growing  into the neighbor's property.  That's right.  You haven't really trimmed it down  and kept it in its area.  It's not like a lot of people  are coming over anymore.  Ah, no.  You know,  you throw that party  every once in a while, sure. 
[02:20:00]  But generally,  it might be a little more musty  in there than it used to be.  You think the smell of the house  is a little different?  You know,  you're not flipping those windows open  and letting it circulate  as often as you used to.  It doesn't have that  new house smell anymore?  No.  Nah.  All right, anyway.  We're talking about houses,  right, Annette?  Yes, we are.  Sure we are.  What are you wearing?  A little skirt,  something easily accessible  or are you completely nude?  Bathrobe.  A bathrobe.  That's good.  Easy access.  Nice.  All right.  And that's it? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  All right,  take the bathrobe off.  Okay.  Do the boobs fall right to the floor  or do they have a nice little bounce?  Do they just kind of go,  go, go, go?  Oh, I guess you could say that.  They go, go, go, go.  A little, go, go, go.  They don't hang to my knees.  If that's what you want to know.  All right.  Your belly button's not in between your boobs, right?  No.  All right.  That's nice.  Good, good, good.  When you lay on your back,  they don't fall to the sides, do they?  No.  No.  I wouldn't be with her if they was.  Oh, wow.  Right.  I like this guy.  You don't have to sleep with your head  propped up like John Merrick, do you? 
[02:21:00]  All right.  That's very good.  I guess we need to know  what kind of nips you have there.  We do.  Sure.  Why not?  Nips.  They're pierced.  Well, pierced?  I'm not a fan of the pierced nips.  That's almost a clue  as to what kind of hairstyle.  Well, that's why we ask a lot of questions.  Yeah, yeah.  The rubbing thing is almost like secondary.  We can almost figure this out  by just interviewing you.  All right.  But what kind of,  like the whole area, though,  what does it look like?  Does it look like two rivets? 
[02:21:30]  Does it look like,  do you got the slow fade going?  It's probably pretty big  with a slow fade,  I would think,  with the size of them.  Well, big boobs could have  those nasty gravy stains  where they're all over the place.  Are they symmetrical?  They're quarter.  Quarters?  That's small.  Quarters?  Quarters.  I have a quarter.  It's small.  Yeah, that's small.  That's a little weird  when they're big.  When the boobs are big  and you've got the small area,  that's kind of strange.  No, no, no, no.  I like them the size  of the World Trade Center  commemorative silver coin.  Oh, man. 
[02:22:00]  Will we get into that?  Oh, yes.  We'll get into that.  No, they're bigger than quarters.  Okay.  The husband's very happy  with what you got, right?  Yeah, he sent her  looking at them.  No, they're bigger than quarters.  All right.  Does he want to have sex  with you live on the show today?  Yeah, why not?  He said, why not?  All right.  Why don't you have him  get ready?  That'll be the grand finale  after we play here, okay?  Okay.  Y'all got any kids?  Yes, I've got one.  One, okay,  because that can affect  the sound, Opie. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, where is the kid  right now?  He's sleeping.  Okay, very good.  If it sounds like  you're driving,  you know, sometimes  with the phone,  after they have  too many kids,  it could have that sound  like you're driving  a tractor trailer  with a blowout  at 60 miles an hour.  You know, you get that.  Well, you know  what it sounds like.  All right, so the husband's  going to have sex  with you after this?  Okay.  All right.  Now, if they're  going to have sex  on the phone,  I want to make sure  of something.  You are nowhere  near a church, right?  No.  Okay. 
[02:23:00]  Just making sure.  Wow, you did get  smarter.  I want to make sure.  You don't even have a...  There isn't a picture  of Jesus in your room  you're in, is there?  We're nowhere near  St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Or anything.  No.  I don't want anything  religious in there.  They even know about us  in Tennessee, Anthony.  All right, I guess  we're ready to play  Guess What's in My Pants.  I'm so happy we invited  the New York Times reporter  in for this segment.  Yes.  To show how clever  we are.  Jesus.  Okay, if you would 
[02:23:30]  please take the phone  and rub in an up  and down fashion.  Let's all listen.  Okay.  All right.  Yes, very telling.  Very telling.  That is kind of...  I'm probably going to  have to hear that again  but not right now.  Let's hear the side to side.  Now move the phone  side to side.  All right.  Okay, I think 
[02:24:00]  I might have it already.  I really don't need  to hear any more.  Let's hear the circular motion.  Wow.  Hey, we didn't say  to get off.  Jesus.  I want to ask a question.  Do you have a piercing  down there?  Yes.  Yeah, see?  Wow. 
[02:24:30]  How good am I?  Wow.  Good ears, O.  Thank you.  Good ears.  Can you do that again  because you can so hear  just for future games,  Anthony.  Listen to this.  Circular motion.  This is the first time  we've heard a piercing  during this game.  Go ahead.  I hear a little tick.  You hear a little...  It's good.  Yeah.  That sounds like the...  Okay, Charlie,  this is what the whales  are saying.  That sounds like the 
[02:25:00]  distress morse code  from the Titanic.  Right.  A lot of static  with some little ticks in it.  Okay.  What do we need  to hear again here?  The up and down.  Up and down.  Up and down.  Up and down again?  Yeah.  Let's hear that.  Okay.  I think I got it.  Yeah, this is a very old house.  This is almost an abandoned house.  No.  All right.  What are the choices,  Anthony?  We got the...  The choices would be  the 70s Earth Mama Muff, 
[02:25:30]  which is just your basic  unshaven triangle.  Also known as the pool rack  filled with Afro hair.  Right, right.  Okay.  The next choice would be  the Mohawk.  Okay.  Pretty self-explanatory.  Just shaved in on the sides  into a strip.  Okay.  Also called the landing strip.  All right.  Mohawk.  The third choice is  the Hitler mustache,  the mustache of der Führer,  and that is a Mohawk,  but from the belly button down  has kind of been shaved down 
[02:26:00]  a little bit,  so all you're getting  is the little Hitler mustache.  I like to call it  the Charlie Chaplin  to be a little more PC.  Well, you want to make it  a little more fun?  No, I don't care.  You can call it  the Charlie Chaplin  because I can't think of  anyone else with that mustache.  I got to tell you one thing, man.  Hitler wrecked that style  for everybody.  That might have made a comeback  after a few years.  Who knows?  You know, just like  the mutton chops.  Mutton chops,  look at our own bed  in this sort of...  Made a comeback,  the sideburns?  You know, but, you know,  the Hitler mustache  has been ruined forever. 
[02:26:30]  The 70s porno mustache  could come back.  Who knows?  I even saw a guy  doing the Raleigh fingers  on the subway  the other day.  With the spit curls  on the end?  Which is just...  They wax it?  God-awful.  But it's making  a slight comeback,  but the Hitler mustache  will never come back.  Who is the idiot  that's going to go to work  with the Hitler mustache  thinking,  hey, this is...  It makes me look better.  He sure wrecked that look.  Everyone's wearing  the goatee.  Just when you think  he did all the evil  he could possibly do,  he did that too.  That style will never 
[02:27:00]  come back.  Okay, that's the  Hitler mustache.  All right.  And then, of course,  the bald tire,  the clean shaven,  the wood floor,  or as we love  to call it here,  the JonBenet Ramsey.  The JonBenet.  Yes.  All right.  Do a little tap dance.  Get out on that stage.  Can I hear the side?  Where are your  little cowboy six guns?  Make mommy proud.  Can I hear the side-to-side  before I make  my final choice? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, just a second.  All right.  Where's little champagne?  Check the basement.  That's up and down?  No, that was side-to-side.  Yeah, I'm not changing  my decision.  Which is missing  the piercing,  I do believe.  Okay, Anthony,  to you.  I got to go with  pretty,  I'm pretty certain here.  Now, remember,  to you,  don't tell us,  don't fill us in  on anything  until we all guess  and ask you 
[02:28:00]  what you indeed  have down your pants.  I'm going to say,  Opie,  the Mohawk.  The Mohawk.  I'm going with  the Mohawk.  Mohawk.  Jimmy Norton.  That's the landing strip,  Mohawk.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Big Kev.  Mohawk.  Mohawk.  Everyone's going  for the Mohawk.  Oh, God.  I don't know, man.  Moping?  Your decision?  Yeah, the piercing's  throwing me off.  It kind of sounded 
[02:28:30]  like, you know,  an overgrown yard  and you find  the dog toy.  Wow.  That would be  the piercing  in the middle  of that mess.  That's what I was  thinking it was going  to be.  It was flying out  of the lawnmower  in tatters.  Yeah.  You know what?  I want to say  70s Earth Mama Muff  so bad.  Yeah.  But the piercing  threw me off  and I will go  with the  Hitler Mustang  slash Anthony.  All right.  All our guesses  are in.  Now, remember. 
[02:29:00]  Does the New York  Times reporter  want to play?  Want to give a guess?  What do you think?  No.  He worked too hard  to get to the point  he's at.  Yeah, I know.  He's not going  to blow it  by being stupid  on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Tia, if you will,  please tell us  what is in your pants.  Hardwood floor.  Oh, my God.  There's a five o'clock  shadow happening there.  Do you have  Fred Flintstone  mouth going down there?  When was the last time  you took care of the area?  The other day.  The other day.  The other day.  That's what threw us off. 
[02:29:30]  So it's a little grubby.  Dude, we have to add  the five o'clock  shadow to this game  because that's  throwing us off.  Do the circular motion  again.  That does not sound  like a wood floor.  Let's hear it.  I'm telling you,  that's a five o'clock  shadow.  See, I heard  some variations  in the side to side,  but again,  that could just be  because, well,  she had kids.  Well, thanks for playing 
[02:30:00]  Guess What's in My Pants.  Don't play the theme song  because it's a little flat.  We've got to get a better  theme song than that.  All right.  So are you guys  going to have sex now?  Sure.  Cool.  You want to have them  start and then  when we come back  we'll see where they're at.  We'll put you on hold.  Just go to town  and make sure  you're at it  in about  how many minutes?  You've got like  four minutes  to show us  what you've got  when we come back  with the show, okay?  Okay.  All right.  There's Tia 
[02:30:30]  and her husband  in Tennessee  and we'll check in  with them next.  Yes, we will.  Let's listen in  on a show prep meeting  in the open...  Yeah.  Not time for me  to get a little  drink of water.  Figure this stuff  is safe to drink?  Huh?  Actually, I don't care  if it's safe or not.  I drink it anyway.  You know why?  Because I'm an American  and I expect  a little cancer  in my food and water.  That's right. 
[02:31:00]  I'm a loyal American  and I'm not happy  unless I've let  government and industry  poison me  a little bit every day.  Let me have  a few hundred thousand  carcinogens here.  Ah.  A little cancer  never hurt anybody.  Everybody needs  a little cancer,  I think.  It's good for you.  Keep you on your toes.  Besides,  I ain't afraid  of cancer.  I had broccoli  for lunch.  Broccoli kills cancer. 
[02:31:30]  A lot of people  don't know that.  It's not out yet.  It's true.  You find out  you got some cancer?  Get yourself  a fucking bowl  of broccoli.  That'll wipe it  right out  in a day or two.  Cauliflower, too.  Cauliflower  kills the really  big cancers.  The ones you can  see through clothing  from across the street.  Broccoli kills  the little ones.  The ones that  are slowly  eating you away  from inside.  While your  goddamn goofy  half-educated 
[02:32:00]  doctor keeps  telling you,  you're doing  fine, Jim.  In fact,  bring your doctor  a bowl of broccoli.  He's probably  got cancer, too.  Probably picked  it up from you.  They don't know  what they're doing.  It's all guesswork  in a white coat.  Here,  let me have  a few more  sips of  industrial waste.  Ah.  Maybe,  maybe I can  turn them cancers  against one another.  That's what  you gotta hope for,  you know,  that you get  more than one cancer 
[02:32:30]  so they eat  each other up  instead of you.  In fact,  the way I look  at it,  the more cancer  you got,  the healthier  you are.  Please state  your password.  Next,  SpamSlicer.com  presents  Megabyte Minute.  Welcome back.  I'm David Radin  on XM  Satellite Radio.  As consumers

[02:35:00]  the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's called  The O.N.A. Virus  Spreading Across America  on XM Satellite Radio.  My headphones are really loud.  We got Jaime  back in New York.  Thank God  because we just had to 
[02:35:30]  reconfigure everything.  Wow, now it's too low, Jaime.  You're killing me.  Here, I'll do it myself.  We got Stephen Lynch  in the studio.  Oh, you're killing me.  Alright, there you go.  We had to like  move everything around  just for you, Stephen Lynch.  Our old friend  has entered the studio  to make his first appearance  on the brand new  O.P. and Anthony Show.  Is Jaime on your  birth certificate  or is that a nickname?  No, it's  Spanish for James.  Oh, it is?  Jaime is Spanish for James.  Because it's a derogatory term 
[02:36:00]  for Jew, isn't it?  A Jaime?  It's like running around  and saying,  Hey, Dago,  could you find nigger  and send him in here?  You know what  my Spanish name is?  Gregorio.  Gregorio.  Gregorio.  I am Gregorio.  How are you?  How are you?  Oh, what's all the noise?  Wow, those mics  were moving around.  It sounded like an earthquake.  Jaime takes care  of all the problems  when he comes up here  like once a week.  We're stalling  because the couple  in Tennessee  are really,  they're getting close 
[02:36:30]  to listening in here.  Can we fix this problem?  The squeaky mics  because we're going to  try some white grease on them.  All right, cool.  White grease.  All right,  why don't we go...  Back back, white.  Let's go back  to Tennessee  really fast.  You know,  Stephen,  we're so excited  to see you.  It's been like two years.  That's my Spanish nickname.  But there's a couple effing,  so we'll get to you  in a minute.  You've got to do. 
[02:37:00]  All right,  these songs can wait.  Let's see Tia.  Yeah?  What's going on over there?  Getting it on.  He's getting it on?  Uh-huh.  Hello?  Yeah, we're listening in.  Pretty quiet.  Yeah, it's pretty quiet.  Well,  I don't know  what else to make you do.  I guess you're not  a screamer  or moaner  or nothing, huh?  When I'm getting ready  to come.  And when is that  going to happen?  Probably 
[02:37:30]  much later  than him.  Oh.  Wow.  What's your husband's name?  Zach.  Zach?  Jack.  Oh,  Jack.  Oh,  quick draw.  Ask Jack  how he's doing  back there.  I'm doing it,  man.  You're doing it?  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  All right,  we're going to just  keep you on in the  background,  and hopefully  this will become  a lot better.  I can't hear anything.  Is there any way  to put the phone  by the area  just to hear it  for a second? 
[02:38:00]  No,  you want to hear  those sounds?  Just for a second,  yeah,  to hear if they're  doing it.  Tia?  Uh-huh.  What position  are you guys in?  I've got him  on top.  You've got him  on top?  Uh-huh.  All right,  and he's just  going to town  right now?  Uh-huh.  All right,  well,  we'll see what  happens.  This is our  first try.  How long  have you been  married?  Six years.  Six?  Yep.  Hmm.  I can tell you  guys really put  a lot of passion  into this.  You lay back  and doze off  while he gets  on for three 
[02:38:30]  minutes.  Both collapse  and hate each  other.  You're not  catching up  with mom.  I mean,  you know,  what's going  on over there?  I wouldn't  brag with  four-inch.  What?  I wouldn't  brag four-inch.  No,  he's not four-  He was packing  four yesterday.  He was packing  four.  It didn't mean  that's as big  as it was going  to get.  You know,  if you're on  your way to  twelve,  you have to  pass through  four at some  point.  I didn't stop  in four,  sir.  I just waved  as I went  right by it.  All right.  Well,  we'll see what  happens with  this couple. 
[02:39:00]  Every journey  starts with  the first step.  Every erection  starts with  the first four.  I heard a moan.  Uh-huh.  All right.  It's getting a  little better  over there?  Yeah.  Are you going  to get...  How about  maybe the doggy  action,  no?  Yeah.  Oh,  he's outside.  Yeah.  Sir,  I want you to  hit it so hard  that you almost  knocked the house  off the cinder blocks.  Wow. 
[02:39:30]  This is how they  do it in Tennessee.  This is how they  do it in Tennessee.  It's getting a  little better,  huh?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  It is Tennessee,  so they probably  had the same  last name even  before they got  married.  Whoa.  Hey,  what happened  there?  I think they're 
[02:40:00]  having sex  in the barn.  I think there  might have been  a little slippage  right there.  Uh-huh,  uh-huh,  uh-huh.  So,  what you been  up to,  Steven?  The show  hasn't changed.  I mean,  who are you kidding?  No.  It's exactly  the same.  The only difference,  we don't have to  worry about the  boss's calling us  into an office  after this.  We did all this  on regular radio.  Sure.  You're kidding.  All right,  so, 
[02:40:30]  is he getting  close?  Oh,  darling,  he's done.  He's done?  He's done?  He's done?  That was an  explosive orgasm?  Yeah.  How do you know  he's coming?  He blinks more?  His neck  turns really red.  His what?  What?  His neck  will turn really red.  That's great.  What a shock  in Tennessee.  Uh-huh.  Oh,  he attacks a minority,  has an orgasm?  All right,  well,  that was our  first try at this. 
[02:41:00]  Not to,  um...  We're all about  improving as we  move along,  so,  all right.  Not much energy  there.  Well,  when you haven't  seen each other  for a week,  it just doesn't  take much.  That's after not  seeing each other  for a week?  Won't have to  straighten out  the Elvis pictures  on the wall,  that's for sure.  That sounded like  it was the  seventh one of the  day.  Although it could  be because they  have a kid,  they've learned  to have sex  very quietly so  as not to wake  the little tots.  Yeah,  we've done  that too.  All right.  Well,  they wake up,  join in, 
[02:41:30]  come sleep with  mommy and daddy.  Well,  you guys,  he's old enough  to hold the  video camera.  You guys were  good eggs today,  thank you.  Thank you.  Come into bed  and sleep with  mommy and daddy,  they should be  here shortly.  like the midnight  cowboy.  Let's say he's  sitting there  with grandma  and her boyfriend.  He's got a little  cowboy hat on.  Let's say goodbye  to Tia and her  husband in Tennessee.  Tennessee let us  down today,  I gotta say.  No,  I can't say that.  I gotta disagree.  They just are  very quiet.  First timer.  Yeah.  They were troopers. 
[02:42:00]  For the first time  it wasn't bad.  They went through it.  Justin from Boston,  what's up?  Hey,  welcome back,  buddy.  You guys,  I'm so psyched you  guys are back  on the air  down here.  Who's your daddy?  Hey,  I'm not a Red Sox fan,  man.  I'm a Pats fan.  She's a ticket holder  for 10 years.  That's what every  Sox fan says  when they start losing.  Go Pats,  I know.  Yeah,  it really is.  I'm not a Red Sox fan.  I root for Charles Stewart.  I'm not a Red Sox fan,  man.  All right,  so what's up, 
[02:42:30]  Justin?  No,  it just wrecked my day  with those hicks  from Tennessee.  If I fuck my wife  tomorrow,  can I just do that  call you guys tomorrow  because that's bullshit.  Tennessee,  as long as we don't  have to hear,  oh,  Hatter,  do it to me,  Hatter.  You're going to come?  I'm all set.  I'm all set.  I love when the states  start fighting.  Yeah,  Tennessee is a bunch  of pussies.  Boston's going to show  you how it's done  tomorrow.  Yeah,  the states get into  little battles  with each other.  A bunch of morons.  Look at me.  What type of bitch  moans in heat?  That's like, 
[02:43:00]  yeah,  they were real though.  I'll say that.  They didn't put on  a dumb show.  They just did it  the way they do it.  I kind of like that.  Yeah,  a little quieter  than I would have liked,  but they did it  the way they do it.  All right,  Justin,  we'll look forward  to you guys tomorrow.  Thanks,  man.  Ben,  pencil that in  for the 730 break.  All righty.  Hatter.  Tell me Hatter.  All right,  we'll see if Boston  comes through tomorrow.  We will see.  We will see.  All right,  we got Stephen Lynch  in the studio.  Pull out your quack.  Right. 
[02:43:30]  Hatter.  Hatter.  Shut up.  Well,  Stephen,  it's just like yesterday  you were in here,  huh?  Seems like it.  It's only been  over two years.  No Jaeger machine  out there,  though.  I know,  we're working on everything.  It's nice to get the  actual broadcast  equipment fixed first  before you start adding  the liquor machine.  I know,  our priorities did change.  Foosball table.  Pinball table.  Jaeger machine,  and then we won't care  about the equipment  not working.  You got a point.  These guys we work with,  they have no idea. 
[02:44:00]  Not the guys in the studio,  the other people  in the office area.  What a party  it's going to turn into.  Oh,  you could see that  all this is going to  disappear,  all the cubicles  and stuff outside,  right?  There's nowhere to smoke  out there,  either.  There's no place  to smoke pot.  Club Stinky,  remember Club Stinky?  There's no place  to put a bar yet.  No place to work  on it.  Foosball table,  we like playing foosball  during the breaks.  All the cubicles  got to go,  and then we can put  the foosball table back.  We don't have a green room.  Where did you have to sit  on someone's desk,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah,  this is,  don't worry,  we'll change everything  eventually.  No,  I like this. 
[02:44:30]  Or maybe we'll just  go to another building.  That's true,  who knows?  Maybe we'll just do that.  Hey,  what we did  after we got the boot,  Steven,  a lot of,  I used to see you  at bar nine.  That's right.  Remember that?  We would go down there.  This is because we didn't  have any work.  We didn't have a show.  So everyone from the show  would go to a bar,  we'd get snoted hammered,  get up on stage,  and pretty much do the show  in front of,  ah,  50 people  at the bar.  You're being kind.  Some days,  15,  20.  15. 
[02:45:00]  We'd sing She Talks to Angels  15 times.  15 times,  wrong words,  drunk,  no show.  You guys would harmonize.  Those were good times.  Good times.  You would harmonize.  Good times.  You remember the time  you did that song  at bar nine?  That was awesome.  That was cool,  man.  That was cool.  God,  why do I,  hold on.  Jessica wants in.  Nope.  She actually liked  the Tennessee couple.  Yes,  I did.  You're calling from Baltimore.  What's up,  Jessica?  Yeah,  I'm waiting to get  my load on this truck 
[02:45:30]  and I was listening  and I went back  in my sleeper  and damn,  it's been a while.  You're a trucker,  ain't she?  Yeah,  that's what has changed  with the radio show,  Stephen.  We have a lot of truckers  that love this radio show  and we're trying to get,  oh yeah,  we're trying to get used to this.  It's a little,  well,  I pulled out of Pittsburgh  rolling down the eastern  board.  I got my diesel wound up  and she's running  like I never before.  Bam,  bam,  bam,  bam.  There's a speed zone  and hey,  well,  all right,  I don't see a cop inside.  Six days on the road  and I'm going to make it 
[02:46:00]  home tonight.  Say that again,  Jessica?  Try more like 30 days  on the road.  We got us a convoy.  Are you a large Marge?  No,  I'm not.  Large Marge.  I will describe me to you  and you tell me.  Are you a Perticeat cover?  No.  Now,  I'm five foot tall,  122 pounds,  long blonde hair  and a 32 double D.  Oh man,  you sound and look  like Dolly Parton.  Well,  listen to her voice. 
[02:46:30]  She could steer the truck,  shift and roll the window down  at the same time  with those boobs.  That's right.  All right,  so you enjoyed  the Tennessee couple?  Yes,  I did,  as a matter of fact.  As a matter of fact.  Where are you from originally?  Kentucky.  Kentucky.  So you went  the bluegrass thing.  You went back into your sleeper  and you took care of yourself  while listening to that?  Yes.  Oh,  you must have really  bad hearing.  You watch movies  and stuff like that  and that gets kind of boring  after a while,  but you hear something 
[02:47:00]  different like that  on radio.  Did you put on?  Yeah,  I'll blow the monsters  off this damn radio.  Did you put on  the factor?  Bill O'Reilly,  get in your sleeper cabin,  masturbate to my sexual rantings.  Bill O'Reilly factor.  Oh God.  Did you use anything  on yourself?  Yeah.  What was it?  A tower iron?  A what?  A pocket rocket.  Oh,  she's got a pocket rocket?  A pocket rocket?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:47:30]  She's got to use that  because Benoit balls  would roll all over  the dashboard.  Wouldn't be able  to keep tabs on them.  Goddamn,  rolled under the seat.  All right,  Jessica,  you call back anytime.  You're all right.  All right,  thank you.  All right,  there you go,  Jessica.  Keep her between the ditches.  She's loading her big rig  listening to the  Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Loading her big rig.  So,  yes.  It's a whole new contingency.  Oh,  it really is.  It really is.  We're loving the truckers.  They're great.  They're the ones  spreading this show  all over the place.  They're getting on  their CBs going,  you listened to  Opie and Anthony 
[02:48:00]  yesterday.  I'm going to get  to my shows.  It's just going to be  like a convoy  parked in front.  Oh,  where is your show?  Wow,  Steven has a lot  of equipment these days.  Look at all  the tractor trailers.  No,  that's...  Who's got the stool?  We're done.  You see the crappy  van in front?  That's Lynch.  All the big rigs  are the Opie and Anthony  heads.  You mean the Avis  Ford Focus.  Wow.  Things have not changed  much for me in two years.  I don't know about that.  I see you everywhere now.  Lynch blew up  since we've been  off the air,  even more so. 
[02:48:30]  You're playing  in New York  this weekend?  Yeah,  Town Hall.  Town Hall on Saturday?  Two shows.  Friday or Saturday?  Saturday.  Saturday.  Saturday night.  Town Hall.  Saturday night,  Town Hall.  And you've got this  new DVD out,  Live at the El Rey.  Yeah.  Cool.  Very cool.  Greg Opie Hughes  quote on the back.  I know,  I was kind of flattered  about that,  because I was drunk  when I was talking  to the New York Times.  And we've got a  New York Times guy  right behind you,  by the way.  So you'll probably  be part of our article.  Cool.  In between talking  about sex,  they had this  very funny guy  in singing silly songs. 
[02:49:00]  About sex.  About sex.  Yeah,  my quote was,  he's radio gold.  When you do a show  like ours,  to have someone  like him is a rarity.  Wow.  It was a quote  about someone else,  but you put it on your...  I used it.  I know,  it might as well,  right?  And then on the DVD...  Great motion picture.  On the DVD,  you see one movie  this year.  See Stephen Lynch.  On the DVD...  See...  Live at the El Rey.  On DVD,  he thanks all of us,  but for me,  it's Greg Hughes,  a.k.a.  Opie from the  Opioidality Show.  Ah. 
[02:49:30]  So I became  a Stephen Lynch  stalker, too.  I was in L.A.  I wouldn't say a stalker.  You came to a couple shows.  We hung out in Vegas.  You don't know  where he was peering  at night?  A couple.  I drove from L.A.  I drove from L.A.  to Vegas with Tyke.  That's right.  Tyke and his...  All of us.  And his L.A.  Were you in the car?  Yeah.  Oh.  Me and my lady  and Tyke and you...  No, you guys were  behind us, man.  I was in the Tyke car  with the two L.A. guys  that scared the crap out of me.  I was on the way...  Yeah, no.  From L.A. to Vegas,  I was driving with Tyke 
[02:50:00]  and two scary dudes from L.A.  Oh, okay.  Did you drive with other people?  Were you driving?  Tyke's car, you know,  it looked like it was  going to blow up  but we made it to Vegas.  That's right.  I never drive with anyone anymore.  Unless I can drive my car,  I won't go anywhere.  I was in L.A.  I'm petrified of people.  I was in L.A.  checking out Dice  at the Comedy Store.  I look across the street  at the House of Blues  and on the marquee it says,  you know,  tomorrow night,  Steve and Lance.  I'm like,  get the F out of here.  So I checked him out there  and then I hit the road.  We road tripped.  I hit the road with the guys.  I'm like,  hey, I have nothing else 
[02:50:30]  to do for two years.  You look like a vagabond too, man.  You had a big beard  and long hair.  I really did.  There's not many  of those pictures.  There's a little stick  with the hobo thing  hanging off the back of it.  There's like the Unabomber look.  Ted Kaczynski look.  There's only one picture of me  with the really long hair  that the Post likes to print a lot.  But besides that,  yeah,  I started growing the beard  and everything.  I looked like shit, man.  I didn't care.  So anyway,  all right,  you want to do some songs?  Sure.  You know,  we've been playing Craig Christ,  which actually 
[02:51:00]  when I was stalking you  in Orlando  is when you debuted that song.  Then I'm in Orlando.  Is he playing outside  Space Mountain?  He was at the House of Blues  down there.  You think me,  you think Disney.  Yeah,  I think he did  the House of Blues tour.  I hope he was stalking you  in a Tigger suit.  Language, Anthony, language.  I drove down to Orlando  to see my family  and I'm listening  to local radio  and they're talking about  Stephen Lynch  at the House of Blues.  I'm like,  might as well go see 
[02:51:30]  Stephen Lynch again.  There you go.  I saw him down there, too.  It's like serendipity.  And I think that's where  I heard Craig,  Craig,  we'll just say Craig,  in case people haven't  heard this song yet.  I couldn't believe it.  I laughed so freaking hard  at the Craig song.  Thanks, man.  You want to start with that?  You want me to play that one?  All right.  Well, I guess that's a good one.  Well, did you have another song  you wanted to warm up with?  No, I'll start with this.  Just to see if the guitar  is working and stuff?  Might as well get right to the...  All right.  Jaime,  is everything going to work?  This is the first time  we've had a musician  on the new show. 
[02:52:00]  Does that sound all right, Jaime?  Check, check, test one.  Dude, it's not like  we have Zeppelin in the studio.  It's Lynch.  It should be good enough.  What?  Do what?  Nice.  That's your sound check.  Dude, I don't...  Four, one...  Oh, count?  One, two, three, four?  One, two...  All right.  Up or low?  Up.  Okay.  Oh.  Well.  All right.  This is a Bible song.  All right.  Here it is.  Stephen Lynch.  It's about a little-known 
[02:52:30]  biblical character.  Everyone knows Jesus,  the man who healed the lame.  Well, I am Jesus' brother.  Craig is my name.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace.  Jesus is the Lamb.  Jesus is the Son of God.  But Craig, don't give a damn. 
[02:53:00]  Because when Craig's inside,  we'll party all damn night.  I don't turn water into wine,  but into Coco's light.  I'm not my brother, I know.  Don't walk on H2O.  But I got hydroponic shit  that me and Judas grow.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  Craig Christ.  I hang out with lepers, 
[02:53:30]  Barabbas and Salome.  Jesus' friends are called apostles.  Those dudes are totally gay.  Jesus is the Prince of Peace.  No, wait.  I already did that.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  How are we going to replay this  a million times on our show?  You messed it up. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, yeah, I know what it is.  All right, go.  Jesus performs miracles  from Galilee to Rome.  But it would be a miracle  if it brought a fucking lady home.  Because while Jesus is praying,  fucking Craig is laying  every lady in the Testament.  You know what I'm saying?  I won't die for your sin  like my famous kin.  But if you got a little sister,  then there's room at this end. 
[02:54:30]  Now, I'm fucking Craig.  Yeah, I'm fucking Craig.  Yeah, I'm fucking Craig.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  Jesus was our mother's faith.  All her love to him she gave.  But there's no sibling rivalry  when he's nailed to that tree. 
[02:55:00]  And now the question for you  is not what would Jesus do,  but where will you be  when the Craig machine  comes partying through?  And if the Lord would allow,  you've got to ask yourself  how and who and why  and when and where  is your Messiah now.  It's fucking Craig.  Craig.  Fucking Craig.  Fucking Craig.  Hey, God.  Fucking Craig. 
[02:55:30]  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ.  I'm fucking Craig.  Yeah, right on, man.  Steven Lynch on the  Opie and Anthony Show.  Here are your sinuses.  And you don't have to  censor yourself.  I love this.  That's awesome.  Isn't it awesome?  I've never been able to play that  on the radio before.  Seriously?  No.  First time I do.  I'm going to do that.  Oh, yeah.  I keep forgetting that  no one else gets to play this game. 
[02:56:00]  I'm gosh darn Craig.  I tried to play it on Carson Daly.  All right?  And I got the...  It was like that scene  from The Doors  and the guy goes,  you know,  you can't say girl,  we couldn't get much higher.  Right.  But girl,  we couldn't get much better.  Exactly.  You can't say  spend the night together.  You can say  spend some time together.  Time together, right.  Yeah.  I couldn't say fucking.  I couldn't say gay.  I couldn't say Jesus.  And I couldn't say Christ.  Yeah, that's...  Well, I might...  That's all limited me 
[02:56:30]  a little bit.  Yeah.  That's called  Kill a Kitten.  That song.  That's great.  No, because you can't say  kill or kitten.  Right.  In the same sentence.  I'm getting that  we're the only ones  that get to play  on this field.  It's awesome.  It's unbelievable.  We have no idea  what this thing  could do yet either.  We're learning as we go.  I can stop writing,  you know,  innuendo.  Yeah.  You can just go  right out.  Go get him.  The DVD is  Live at the El Rey.  Stephen Lynch  and he's playing  Town Hall on Saturday.  Thanks for coming by.  My pleasure.  I'm just kidding.  He went for it. 
[02:57:00]  It's like,  what?  He's kicking me out already?  That's always the worst  when Ope starts in with,  yeah, well,  they're telling us  you've got to get out of here quick.  And you're like,  who's telling you that?  There's nobody saying that.  Yeah, but they're saying  you've got to get  moving down the road.  You touch your ear  like there's something in there.  I'm getting,  yes, yes,  we're going to have to go.  He fell for it.  I did fall for it, too.  Dude, you really think  that we prepared enough  for this show  to get us to 10 o'clock?  Guess who's going to...  I think we've been doing  for two years.  I really do have to go,  though, seriously.  Oh, you got to...  Yes! 
[02:57:30]  The reversal.  Shame, motherfucker!  The reversal.  I went,  holy crap,  we're counting on him  to get us to 10 o'clock today.  Oh, man,  that's funny.  Well,  what else can we play?  I'm trying to remember  the old days.  There were so many songs  we couldn't play,  or you had a censor.  Do you have new songs?  Where do you want to go  with this?  New songs?  Oh, the new stuff.  Let me...  Yeah.  I got one that's not even  on the DVD  or either of the records yet.  Is it a brand new one?  Is this a...  Because you know how people  scream out from the crowd. 
[02:58:00]  It's a radio debut.  Do new stuff!  Do new stuff!  They always do that, right?  Yeah.  Freebirds!  Yeah, let me try this one.  A song about the truth.  I wrote it about a lady  I was seeing  not too long ago.  Hopefully I'll remember  the lyrics this time.  Have a seat and listen.  Please don't say a thing. 
[02:58:30]  In matters of the heart  sometimes the truth  will have a sting.  Just don't take it personally.  This is no attack.  But we will never last  because I'm white  and you are  also white.  I only like black girls  the brown girls  the cafe au lait  the caramel girls  and mocha girls  just blow me away.  If you are newbie  and I want you to be  in every fantasy  but if you're a whitey  say nighty nighty 
[02:59:00]  you're just not the girl  for me.  Woo hoo!  Well her body is a turn on  curvaceous front and back  her hair is quite literally  an aphrodisiac  don't call it jungle fever  cause that just isn't right  I am not a racist  some of my best friends  are white  I just prefer black girls  the brown girls  the cafe au lait  the caramel girls 
[02:59:30]  and mocha girls  just blow me away  well if you're a cracker  you better get blacker  or else you best get out  it is no mystery  I like a citrus  see that's what  I'm talking about  oh man I hate vanilla ice cream  white rice is so bland  the milk chocolate melts  in your mouth  not in your hand  the color is not the issue here  it's dignity 
[03:00:00]  it's class  it's all about her heart  okay it's partly about that ass  I want me some black girls  the brown girls  the cafe au lait  the caramel girls  and mocha girls  just blow me away  well if you're a honky  you're singing the wrong key  it's the honest truth  the skin that she's dwelling in  must contain melanin  that is the fountain of you  Thomas Jefferson

[03:07:30]  Stephen Lynch on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The DVD live at the LRA.  Nice.  And he's playing Town Hall here in New York City Saturday.  I'll be there Saturday without a doubt, man.  It's going to be fun.  Yeah, I'm with Mitch Hedberg.  Oh, really?  You're touring with Mitch these days?  Yeah, we're doing a tour.  So what's the deal?  Is his leg falling off?  He seems to be fine.  I mean, I've heard all the rumors, but I've seen none of the craziness.  The rumor was going around that he did so many drugs. 
[03:08:00]  I'm just going with the rumors.  That he was doing so many drugs that he had gangrene and he was going to lose a limb.  That's what I heard, yeah.  He looks like everything's okay, though.  Do you have a hard subject to broach with somebody that you're on tour with?  But you are taking a...  Have a good set tonight.  How's the fucking gangrene leg?  Break out, well, you know, whatever.  Just have fun.  But you are taking peeks.  You are taking peeks and taking a look to see, right?  You're trying to figure it out.  He's usually wearing pants when he's in my company, but...  But he's walking pretty good and stuff?  Yeah, he seems to be fine.  I don't know.  Dude, he's going to lose the leg soon. 
[03:08:30]  He's hilarious.  That's morbid.  Yeah, well, it's been going around on the internet.  You know, and the internet's always...  Oh, I thought like a sickness.  So lose your leg disease.  It's been going around.  I know three people.  You read it on the internet.  It's got to be true.  So, all right.  Why don't we take a break, regroup a little bit,  and we'll have more with Stephen Lynch in just a bit here.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Socks first, then shoes.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You guys are a hip cat crowd, man. 
[03:09:00]  I needed you guys.  I don't always get hip crowds.  I know you're thinking, no way.  Butch, L.A., New York, Ontario.  Come on.  Not always, man.  I get sent to some weird, weird places.  Like, yeah, check this out.  Here's a good example.  Two months ago.  Now, I'm not sure if anybody's going to be familiar with this place.  But two months ago, I, Butch Lorde, played Branson, Missouri.  Now, if you're laughing, you know what Branson is.  Those rest...  Look, you see the youngsters are looking at me like,  Branson, blink, blink, what the hell? 
[03:09:30]  Check it out.  Let me hip you, man.  Branson is a little town in Missouri  where a whole bunch of old-time country singers  open their own theaters, right?  They got, like, the Andy Williams Theater, the Roy Clark Theater.  It's like Lollapalooza for senior citizens.  It's a senior Oz fest.  I'm not kidding, man.  They put me in a room with 400 senior citizens.  I scared the shit out of those people, man.  They were staring at me like I was touching their granddaughters or something, you know? 
[03:10:00]  And it wasn't their fault they treat the old people.  They just put a sign up outside that said,  Comedy Tonight.  So 400 old people go staggering in there,  expecting to see Milton Berle.  And they get Charles Manson, pretty much.  It's good for them, though.  They ain't got much exercise in years.  Just trying to run the hell out of there.  That guy said, fuck!  But I'm kidding you, I cleared the Boxcar Willie Theater in record time. 
[03:10:30]  I'm serious.  Two bucks and a pussy, place was empty.  That was it.  That was, uh...  There was no one left, just an old couple down in front with broken hearing aids.  Something about, I like him, he's a cat lover.  That's what kinds of takes you a second, doesn't it, bro?  See you doing the math, carry the two.  Oh, pussy jump, okay.  All right.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show Tip of the Day on XM Radio. 
[03:11:00]  So my son calls from Indianapolis the other day.  He says, Dad, is there a special way to rotate radial tires?  Radial tires are rotated differently than the old bias ply.  The old bias ply rotation was done in a criss-cross pattern.  When radials first came on the scene, the preferred pattern was front to back on the same side of the vehicle.  This was because the steel belts were quite stiff and would develop a wear pattern on one side of the car.  When you switched sides, the tire would develop a bad wear pattern and wear out prematurely.  As the radial tire was developed, manufacturers started using finer, high-tensile steel for the belts. 
[03:11:30]  This allowed the tires to be switched from side to side because of greater flexibility in the belt.  Hence, the preferred rotation method came about.  One set of tires should either go straight back or forward, and the other set should be crossed,  allowing wear time on both sides of the vehicle, resulting in a more even wear pattern.

[03:12:00]  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  Did you just put a firecracker in my vagina?  I just wanted to see what would happen.  No, no.  Get it out.  Come on!  What's the big deal?  I'll be fine.  Are you fucking crazy?  What are you doing with that later?  I'm coming closer.  If you blow up my pussy, I'm going to bludgeon you. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, stop.  Relax.  I'm just screwing around.  Ow!  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I know.  That's it.  Awesome.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[03:13:00]  The best satellite radio company in the world.  XM.  XM Satellite Radio.  I actually got to have three bites of my bagel during that long break.  This is the weird thing.  We don't break for commercials anymore.  Are your mics on?  Hold on.  Okay.  Yeah, we don't really break that much.  We're supposed to break twice an hour, and we just talk for an hour and a half straight.  We used to be able to go out, play some foosball, mix some drinks up, smoke cigarettes, pot, whatever. 
[03:13:30]  You remember when we started bringing in the bartender, right?  No.  What?  Yeah, we were rolling a bar in on Friday's.  I remember the Jaeger machine.  The Jaeger machine was key.  That was the best.  Man.  Middle of the show.  You race the Razor Rollerboard scooter down to the office.  Pour out some icy cold Jaeger.  Right.  A couple of shots.  Back to the studio for the beers.  Right.  The fridge.  Lynch wants to ask for a beer so bad, but he thinks he's out of place.  Like, whoa.  Just have one, man.  Nobody cares.  Drink. 
[03:14:00]  It doesn't make any sense at what time it is in the morning.  They didn't get the refrigerator set up in the office yet.  They're still building our office, so...  Are they building it, or has anything been done?  No.  No.  Nothing has been done.  Nothing.  As far as the office goes?  No.  Did work stop on the vestibule area for our security thing?  Yeah, I think there's a work stoppage going on.  Because I saw the walls went up, the sheetrock's up, but that's it.  I notice when we start talking bad about things, like, the work slows down.  The work slows down?  Yeah, gee.  Are we dealing with unions over here? 
[03:14:30]  What?  We got a work stoppage.  I think we have a work stoppage.  You keep bitching, things ain't gonna get done.  Yeah, we talked bad a couple days ago.  We love being here, but there's growing pains, and we're figuring it all out.  You want the room?  I got a room for you.  It's a 55-gallon drum buried in Queens.  You like that, eh?  Hold on.  This guy has a problem with our channel, 202.  It's Tom in Brooklyn.  What's up, Tom?  Hey.  Hey.  Welcome back.  Oh, thank you.  Listen, I've been calling up, because I'm complaining, right? 
[03:15:00]  Every time you go north of 96th in the city, the station waffles, right?  Who the hell is, you know, I mean, you turn to any other channel, and it works right,  and you get, you know, I got this for you because of you guys, right?  So you go past 96th Street in Manhattan, and our channel fades out?  That's the shwuggy filter.  Yes.  You are.  Tell me what about a golfer.  You do know you're the only person to have noticed that so far, because nobody above 96th  wants to listen to this program. 
[03:15:30]  Right.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  You're dealing with a shwuggy filter.  Maybe you don't.  And in the Bronx, you know, I build houses up here, and, you know, I can't get you guys.  Tom, maybe you can't hear it, because the second you get up there, the unit gets stolen  from your car.  All right.  All right.  He's having a problem listening to us in Harlem, Anthony.  Oh.  Yeah.  I mean, we've talked a renaissance going on up there, though.  It's all nice, from what I hear.  Yeah, it actually is.  I took a walk up there with Earl, because I'm... 
[03:16:00]  A lot of money being poured into that area.  Because I'm obsessed with the black culture.  I really am.  That's why I like...  You and Earl went up there?  That's why I like the new black song that Lynch does.  The new colored tune.  Jesus.  Jesus.  This is my new colored tune.  I think the residents in Harlem are very happy, too.  They really like to see, like, all these nice places going up, and some middle-class white  people moving in.  It really makes them feel good.  Like, there go the neighborhood.  So, I don't know if we even have beer here for you.  Isn't that a shame?  Remember all the beer we used to have, too? 
[03:16:30]  We had refrigerators in our office that we got to put food in.  They got filled up with beer.  So, we had to get another refrigerator, and this one was like, okay, look, those are the  beer fridges.  We need one for food.  And then we put a big sign on the fridge, food.  Food and beer.  And then beer.  We made it very simple.  Within a week.  It was a week.  Food fridge, full of beer.  Yeah.  Of course, the beer fridge was full of beer.  And then they rolled in a cooler for some kind of, like, a Snapple-type beverage. 
[03:17:00]  They had a full-size, like, you walk into a deli, and you get these huge coolers, and it  was for this beverage.  It was probably Snapple or Sobe, one of those.  Sobe, I think.  Sobe.  Full of beer.  Yeah.  After a while.  And that was the good one, because it was closer to the studio.  We didn't have to walk as far for our beer.  You know what happened?  We all became alcoholics, because all the beer companies were competing against each  other for our attention.  So, all of a sudden, the Budweiser palette would be wheeled into our office, and then,  oh, Sam Adams didn't want to be. 
[03:17:30]  Cases.  Sam Adams would come in with their beer.  Yeah.  And then Bacardi would come in with Bacardi Girls and mix drinks for us.  Yeah.  We were snotted.  We really were snotted.  I was drinking.  How do we make that happen?  And no one had the balls to do to make that happen.  No one had the balls to tell us no.  That was the funny part about it.  Dude, I was drinking every day in there.  Every day.  Before the show, drinking beer in the office.  During the show, there was always a bottle of Sam or Bud or something. 
[03:18:00]  Hammered every day.  After the show, we'd get done, go into the office, I'd start playing video games, and  just drinking beer.  It was crazy.  How many beers did you drink during our show?  Seriously.  During the show?  Like, as the show was on?  Or before or after the whole day?  Per day?  How about the pre-show?  All right.  We were on the air at 3, so let's say from 2 p.m. and then...  Two beers before the show.  And then the post-game.  Two beers before the show. 
[03:18:30]  Two beers before the show.  Right.  During the show, probably eight.  I was going to say at least six.  Okay.  No, it was more than six.  All right.  Eight beers.  Eight beers during the show.  Now we're up to ten beers as we're trying to be responsible broadcasters.  Now I understand why our judgment was a little foggy on that day.  Impaired.  On August 15, 2002.  Should have a breathalyzer.  It's every weekday.  Yeah.  And after the show was probably...  Another two.  Another...  No, more after the show, because we used to hang out for a while, watch the Simpsons and  play video games.  It was like doing a radio show with William Holden. 
[03:19:00]  You were nonstop with the booze.  Just drinking like a maniac.  But I've known Anthony for a long time.  You cannot tell when he's buzzed.  That's the strangest thing about it.  No, I'm one of those guys.  I could be really drunk.  And I've been pulled over, hammered off my ass, and just talked to the cop.  And not even...  He didn't even have an inkling that I had been drinking.  Well, maybe it's because of all the stuff that the NYPD gives you to make you look like  you're a detective.  Yeah.  I used to get some good stuff.  You know, I was the only one... 
[03:19:30]  Everyone...  Everyone...  Listen to me.  Remember 9-11?  Remember that time the buildings fell?  Remember that day?  Remember that?  Well, after 9-11, Lower Manhattan, shut down.  You're done.  You ain't coming through here.  We had to drive all the way up to, I think, like the Williamsburg or something.  It was crazy.  Something crazy.  The Queensborough Bridge or the Midtown Tunnel to get into Manhattan.  The cops gave me these window placards where I was the only one in a civilian vehicle driving 
[03:20:00]  through the Battery Tunnel from Brooklyn into Lower Manhattan.  Yeah, most people get the cute PBA cards and they show their friends like, look, I'm going  to get out of everything now.  I had stuff, window placards, cards, things where even the tunnel guys, I'd be going through  and they'd look like to stop me and then, oh, wave me on.  Wave...  And I'm being waved through with big trucks, cop vehicles, ambulance.  I come popping out of the other side of the Battery Tunnel's just wreckage and I'm driving  through it.  I got to get to work.  I got to get to my beer.  So we're slowly putting the old show back together. 
[03:20:30]  Right.  Well.  Slowly.  I shan't be drinking that much.  No, no.  Can't drink in the morning.  No, we got to be responsible.  Can't drink in the morning.  Can't, Anthony?  It totally...  It won't.  It takes the edge off the heroin.  And, you know, I'm trying to work on that now.  We're going to figure out what we can put into our coffee.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think that's the way to go.  Coffee with a shot.  Because alcohol is great in, like, any time afternoon.  Right.  But, I don't know, for morning, you really need some kind of drug. 
[03:21:00]  What's a good morning drug?  A few bumps in the bathroom.  Vicodin?  A few bumps in the bathroom.  A few bumps in the...  I don't want to do, like, blow or anything that's going to bring me up.  Crank was a nice one for mornings.  I need something that's going to feel like booze.  No, because that's like, you're all up, you're grinding your teeth.  I need something that's like booze, but it's a drug, so it's cool to do in the morning.  Hmm.  Vicodin?  Ecstasy?  Pop a tab?  I need you to...  Could you take some glow sticks and wave them in front of my face? 
[03:21:30]  Lock on the guy from Frank Place.  Why is he massaging my shoulders this morning?  Spray me down with water.  Locked out of the Oompa Loompa, fucking his ear.  Oxycontin.  Some Oxycontin?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Try some Oxycontin.  Speaking of 9-11, holy ass, what's going on with these commemorative coins?  Remember 9-11?  That was hilarious.  You know, right when I saw the commercials, I don't think there's an American alive that  was watching TV, sees the commercial for these commemorative coins. 
[03:22:00]  Remember 9-11?  I don't think there's an American alive that watched that and went, oh yeah, that's a great  product.  Boy, thank God someone's exploiting this and putting out a piece of shit coin that's silver  plated.  If you took the silver content off of that, you couldn't fill a mouse tooth with it.  And they're making it sound like it's real silver.  And emblazoned on the front are the towers that we lost on September 11th.  On the backside is the new Freedom Tower rising like a phoenix in its place. 
[03:22:30]  And the money coming out of your pocket and going into our accounts as we exploit this.  That company, I actually called them when I saw the commercial, I've never done that  before, and left a vile, awful message on the machine.  I'm sure they're just laughing at it.  Like they care.  Oh, we better stop selling this.  So this man sounds a little aggravated with us.  Who approved this and who's getting the money?  Whatever the company's name was, they list it. 
[03:23:00]  It's a company, I believe, in Wyoming.  And they got these coins printed on some South Pacific island.  But I saw one commercial, they're claiming some of this metal came from the actual site.  Right.  They're saying that the silver was in a vault that was in the tower, and they dug it out,  got the silver, melted it down, and made these coins.  It's probably technically true, like when Kiss did the comic book in 77, their blood went  into the ink.  They probably, like, you take a little bit, you melt it in. 
[03:23:30]  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, they poured vials of their blood into the ink.  That's true.  So technically it was in there.  Kiss is so cool.  This is also the same company, by the way, that came out with the Andrea Yates commemorative  bathtub rubber duckies.  Jesus.  Dude, the New York Times reporter's right next to you.  I'm sorry.  We're trying to look clever here.  This is our clever book.  That was a great reference.  No one talks about Andrea Yates.  It was brilliant.  Trust me, it was brilliant.  Yeah, Spitzer's on the case, and this guy's usually an ass, but...  Elliot Spitzer, he's looking out for you.  He really is this time around.  Shame, shame, shame on you. 
[03:24:00]  It was a shameless attempt to profit from a national tragedy, obviously.  Yeah.  So they have these things printed up on some South Pacific island, and the commercial is  so misleading.  But if you have half a brain, you can kind of figure it out for yourself.  They were saying legal tender, and it says, in God we trust, and one dollar on it, but  it's not a legal dollar.  So saying legal tender isn't legal.  It's printed on some South Pacific island, so it says, sanctioned by the government. 
[03:24:30]  They don't say what?  The government.  So they don't say what government, making it sound like it's sanctioned by the United  States, which it's not.  They say 100 mil of pure silver.  It's like one hundredth of a millimeter of silver plated over brass, or bronze, not even  brass.  So you're getting nothing for $39.  A one dollar coin for $39. 
[03:25:00]  I'm sure most of the people watching the commercials are assuming this is going for a good cause.  Yeah.  You know?  It's going for their cause.  It's just going for their money in their pockets.  Is it going for a good cause?  They don't, right?  I think they, no, it's not even advertised that it's going for a good cause.  But I think the feel of the commercial, it almost feels like they're going to be giving  this away.  I get to do my part.  I'm doing a good thing.  It is.  They say something like, do your part as an American and buy these, you know.  It just feels dirty, though.  How dumb are people?  Pretty dumb.  To not know that they're not going to make a coin with towers and a freedom tower. 
[03:25:30]  It's just, how stupid is it public?  People are stupid.  Dude, I got in a huge fight down at Ground Zero.  I actually tipped over one of those card tables because, uh.  Wow, the destruction you wrought down there.  Oh, I heard you kicked the chair once.  I tipped the table.  How'd they clean that up down there?  I tipped over a table.  Jesus.  And the police got involved and stuff, but they saw what I was doing and they let me  be.  I got so pissed off.  I skated down to Ground Zero.  I'm checking out the scene, right? 
[03:26:00]  And they were still, I don't know if they're still doing it.  I haven't been down there in a while, but they were still selling the pictures of the  towers on fire.  Oh, there were some ragheads and stuff selling these.  I mean, what a suicidal piece of shit.  These guys were selling pictures of the towers on fire.  Completely on fire.  Big 8x10 photos here in the city.  On fire.  You know, oh, would you like to buy?  What?  How are you alive?  And look at this guy like, how is he still alive?  And I had a moment.  I got in a fight with the guy and he didn't, he didn't even speak English, but he's kind 
[03:26:30]  of getting in my face like, you know.  Go figure that out in New York City.  It's like, he's pretty much like tough shit.  What are you going to do about it?  That's the feeling I got by how he was like, reacted to it.  It was those cheap little card tables.  He had all his displays.  I just went for it.  Knocked the whole thing all.  Tipped it over?  Wow.  Not just tipped it over.  I just completely just destroyed the display.  I'm just picturing you all pissed off.  Getting into a fight.  Slam the table and then you skate away on your little slow motion like a video.  Tipping the table over.  Like Jake Lamarley on skates.  I didn't skate away. 
[03:27:00]  How do you leave?  I angrily on skates.  You're right.  How do you leave?  Yeah.  I showed him.  I showed him.  It's like hopping on a pogo stick and pogoing away.  Yeah, asshole.  Who did this to you?  That guy pirouetting over there.  Don't make me come back here.  Boing, boing, boing, boing.  Cling, cling with the bell.  Cling, cling, cling, cling.  Yeah.  I'm coming back for you. 
[03:27:30]  Out of my way.  I figured I'd share.  Tough guy.  I did my part.  Showed him as he rollerblades away.  You're lucky I'm wearing woman's footwear.  Puts both arms behind his back, leans forward and skates away.  Speed skating fashion.  I showed him. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, boy.  Boy, did I show him.  We got more info on the coins.  Tad from San Francisco.  Hey, Tad.  Hey.  I did, I actually did some research on the internet when I first saw these commercials.  As you can tell, I stay up pretty late listening to the show and stuff like that.  So I'm always watching TV.  And they started these commercials right about the anniversary of it.  And, yeah, I was like the 12th or something.  I saw that and I just flipped out. 
[03:28:30]  But I did some research on it.  They're minted by the North Marianas Islands, which is actually part of the United States.  It's a commonwealth that we're in charge of.  Yeah, I'm sure we really, I'm sure it's just like, you know, Nebraska.  I'm sure they're one of the countries that sent help in Iraq.  There's four of them.  The Coalition of the Willing?  Yeah.  We, uh, the actual, the U.S. Mint put out a thing that said, um.  Easter Island sent, like, five heads to Iraq as a coalition of the willing. 
[03:29:00]  Five of those big Easter Island heads.  So they're part of the coalition, which is nice.  Yes.  Sorry, sir.  Yes, go ahead.  Canary Island sent three canaries.  They just talk all day.  Go ahead.  Come on, Tad.  Let's go.  Yes, sir.  Sorry I keep interrupting, Tad.  But I would like to throw some entertainment on this program.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, Tad, make your point.  Well, um, the thing is that, uh, they're now saying they, they actually stole this.  They keep saying it's recovered silver.  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  But it's, it was stolen from some bank vault.  I guess they sent people in there in the middle of the night or something to sneak in and steal  this silver that actually belongs to some bank here in New, or well, not here, but there  in New York.  This numismatic humor.  I don't even think the silver came from ground zero.  So how, how do they, how do they prove that?  You know?  I know.  How do you prove that one?  You don't.  It's just like when we all got a piece of the Berlin Wall when that came down.  Oh, yeah.  How do we know that?  I have a piece at home. 
[03:30:00]  I know.  How do I know that my little piece was actually from the Berlin Wall?  Yeah, I got a piece of the Berlin Wall.  It's a piece of chipped cement off the divider on the FDR.  That's what it is.  Hey, look at that.  Freedom.  Great.  But it gives you that little paper to prove that it came from the Berlin Wall.  And it's gotta be true.  Authenticity.  Authenticity.  Thank you, Jim.  Certificate of Authenticity.  That's what they give, too, is a certificate of authenticity.  For what?  That it's a coin?  Yeah.  That it's round?  That it weighs something and you can roll it?  That the metal came from ground zero or close to ground zero?  No, they're not fessing up anything.  Well, if it was stolen, I'm sure Fat Liz Taylor has a few copies. 
[03:30:30]  God almighty, this greedy bitch.  She owns a painting that supposedly is an old Nazi booty stolen from where?  From the Jews?  Were they stealing from anyone else?  From the French?  The French just gave it to them.  No, it's supposed to be somebody saying, hey, that's my painting.  It's my family's painting.  It was stolen.  And Liz Taylor just ain't fessing up.  No.  She wants it. 
[03:31:00]  She just rolls it up and puts it under that awful wig and walks around.  You are a disgusting fat body, Liz Taylor.  All right.  Give me my painting.  Why don't we get another song from Stephen Lynch?  All righty.  He is in here.  He's got his guitar.  He came prepared.  Jaime set up the whole studio for music today.  Stephen Lynch has a DVD out called Live at the El Rey, and he's playing Town Hall here  in New York City on Saturday.  It's a sold-out show, I believe.  You want to promote any other dates?  Are they on your website? 
[03:31:30]  L.A. next week.  L.A. is at the Wiltern on the 21st.  And then Vegas on the 22nd.  What place in Vegas?  Back at the House of Blues.  Hey, ever hear the George Carlin House of Blues bit?  I have.  Maybe we should play that, Opie.  I'd love to hear that.  You obviously just got your XM Satellite Radio hooked up.  Jesus Christ.  He's been playing 8,000 times on this show.  Yeah, we used to...  No more Carlin.  We used to love George Carlin.  We now hate him.  Yeah, I understand.  I'm at the point now, if I see him, I'll punch George Carlin in the face, and he'll have 
[03:32:00]  no clue why.  Yeah.  Stop talking, George.  What?  I didn't see him.  Why?  Okay.  You punch him numerous times.  He goes, shit!  Oh, piss!  Oh, fuck!  Cut!  Oh, cocksucker!  Motherfucker!  Tits.  There you go.  No reason to do six.  Nothing.  All right, so what do we want to play tonight?  I don't know.  Are you getting requests, or do you just want me to do something?  Something that you can't play on commercial radio.  Ooh, very good.  What do you want to hear, Anthony? 
[03:32:30]  Just kill a kitten.  There's a gerbil saw, and there's a...  Oh, the gerbil song, Richard Gere, has a movie out.  Down to the Old Pub Instead could be kind of cool, because we got a brand new wiffle  ball bat, Stephen Lynch, and it still hasn't been broken in, because a girl came in here,  I don't know, Monday, and she was ready to do the wiffle ball bat challenge, but her  friend arrived.  Yes.  Her friend arrived.  Oh, okay.  Yesterday, we actually had a girl with self-esteem, which was irritating.  Yeah.  What? 
[03:33:00]  Who has self-esteem?  I'm not putting that in me.  Yeah, yesterday we had an escort with...  An escort with self-esteem.  With self-esteem.  Yeah.  Only on our show.  You know that by now.  We have the worst luck.  Yeah, you do.  Jimmy, don't defend.  Don't defend her.  I have to.  She didn't like you as a person.  She did like me.  She didn't like you.  She thought I was cute and in shape.  She didn't like you.  It's like a girl with self-esteem came in.  She's a goddamn...  Come on.  She liked my appendix scar.  She thought it adds character.  Hold on.  Before 10 o'clock, we've got to get the review of the girl that Norton was with last night. 
[03:33:30]  Yes.  Norton had a dating experience last night.  I heard a little bit of that on my way over here.  Yeah.  So we've got to get her review of the whole night.  That's her.  Oh, wow.  Free of charge.  Oh, that always works.  Oh, let me see in the magazine.  Yeah, that always works on the radio.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  I'm kidding.  I was showing a picture of Undertale.  All right.  Let's get a song from Stephen Lynch.  Whatever you're feeling, Stephen.  I love all your songs.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know whether they're doing the old stuff or the new stuff.  What really, really upsets people and aggravates them? 
[03:34:00]  Kill a Kitten.  Let's play that one.  All right.  That's a great classic.  That's a great classic.  One, two, three.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting, it helps a lot if you kill a kitten.  Mark my words, because from where I'm sitting, you can't go wrong if you kill a kitten. 
[03:34:30]  Tell me it's haunting, Anthony.  Haunting.  Thank you.  Haunting ballad.  Ah, just like the old times.  There's no crime that you'll be committing.  I know the law, you can kill a kitten. 
[03:35:00]  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting, you'll get plenty when you kill a kitten.  Feed it turpentine or break its spine.  Crush it with your shoe as long as you... 
[03:35:30]  Kill a kitten.  Meow.  Kill a kitten.  All right.  Listen up.  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten, she'll like you better when you kill a kitten.  And I'll quote the Bible, cause that's where it's written.  If ye loveth Jesus, he must kill a kitten. 
[03:36:00]  It's in the Bible, too, I swear to God.  Flush him down the can, hit him with your van, drown him in a lake, bake a kitty cake, throw  him at a train, make him snort the cocaine, stick some TNT up his cat booty. 
[03:36:30]  Do what you must do, as long as you...  Kill a kitten.  Meow.  Meow.  Kill a kitten.  Killing kittens isn't easy, and if the thought makes you feel queasy, grab a pitchfork from  the shed, and kill a puppy dog instead. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Woo!  Kill a kitten.  You gotta kill a kitten.  A little furry kitten.  You gotta kill that kitten.  Well, kill a little motherfucker.  Taps the motherfucker.  Kill a little motherfucker.  You gotta touch the motherfucker.  8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  8-6-7-5-3-0-9. 
[03:37:30]  Let's hear it for Stephen Wright.  You're still holding back a little bit, though, I noticed.  He's not used to the satellite radio.  You didn't commit to the motherfucker.  It's ingrained in my head now.  You did not commit to the motherfucker during that song.  Yeah, I'm not used to it.  He'll be on another radio show doing it, just cursing like crazy.  Oh, wait, what?  I forgot.  Hey, what?  Can't say that.  That's awesome.  Let's say hi to Adam from Jägermeister.  Adam! 
[03:38:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good, good.  Tell us what we want to hear today.  Come on.  A Jägermeister tap machine is on its way to you.  Oh, nice.  Paul is right with the world.  Nice, icy, cold Jäger.  You work for Jägermeister?  Yep.  I do all the Jägermeister sponsorships.  All right.  And we're out here on the West Coast getting ready for the Jägermeister tour.  And we're going to come by and offer you guys some tickets to the Jägermeister tour.  It's 9.35 now. 
[03:38:30]  Right.  How soon?  Yeah, when can it be here?  Yeah.  Not in a few minutes, but it's definitely on its way.  All right.  We're going to put you on hold, and Ben's going to talk to you.  Tears of joy streaming down Steve's face.  Yeah, he really is going through DTs right now.  Joe from Brooklyn.  What's up?  Someone hooked up in that little room over there right by him on an IV.  Yeah.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Real fast.  Come on.  Oh, I said Opie's the only guy I know who can kick ass underwater and on rollerblades. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, if you line up Opie's footwear when he's in fights, it would look pretty silly.  You'd see, like, flippers and rollerblades, clown shoes.  I don't have time to tell that story again today.  Moon boots.  I did get in a fight underwater, 60 feet underwater, with a Frenchman.  That is as true as it gets, though.  Right out of a scene from Sea Hunt.  It really was.  Knife in his teeth. 
[03:39:30]  It really was.  All right.  I think we do another song, actually.  Oh!  And then we'll take a break and play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  Like a music show today.  Well, I don't know.  You know, Stephen's a big star now.  He hits the road.  We might not see him for another two or three months.  That's true.  You never know.  Or we might see him tomorrow.  The Jaeger machine.  Dude, if you want to come back tomorrow, by all means, with Tyke, do a couple duets tomorrow  with Tyke.  Maybe I will.  You should, man.  Sounds pretty good.  I want to hear F your sister, but you can't do it by yourself. 
[03:40:00]  Only one break left?  Not really.  Oh, we could just go to the end?  We haven't even...  We didn't do any breaks today.  Yeah, we did a couple.  Did we?  Yeah.  We did one.  We just did one.  Did we?  Okay.  You got amnesia.  I'm getting a little tired here.  All right.  Now what?  What are you looking at me for?  A song.  Yeah.  What do you want to hear, Anthony?  Hmm.  Let me think.  No.  I'm really good under pressure. 
[03:40:30]  Look at me go.  That's all right.  Take your time.  No need to rush.  It's only a live radio show.  Yeah.  Okay.  A little dead air.  We could do audience participation and do superhero in honor of Christopher Reeves.  Oh.  That song could take 20 minutes now.  Yeah, it does take 20 minutes.  No, no.  We'll do that another day.  What happened?  How about something a little slower?  Down to the Old Pub Instead is kind of nice.  That is a nice song.  Or...  I've got to be honest with you.  I thought you meant slower.  I don't know that I'm prepared to sing that song.  Okay.  I haven't done it in so long.  I don't think I'd run it. 
[03:41:00]  It's a nice medley.  I don't have my little whistle for the musical interlude either.  That's right.  That's right.  In the middle.  I thought you meant by a little slower, something like Special Ed.  Ooh.  Like slow like that.  Yeah, that's an oldie.  That's a goodie.  That's a nice number if you want to do that one.  It's a nice giddy.  It's expensive.  Do you still do Special Olympics?  Sometimes.  If the occasion calls.  Uh-huh.  I'll do this one.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very special friend. 
[03:41:30]  Ed was kind, with good intents, but just a little different.  Oh, Special Ed.  His mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special.  Oh, just a little bit special. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, we'd play tag and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier, he'd eat dirt.  I like math and the spelling bee.  Ed liked talking to a tree.  Oh, Special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed. 
[03:42:30]  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls.  Ed ran headfirst in two walls.  I had girly girls and lots of clothes.  Ed had names for all his toes.  Like Larry and Terry and Jerry and Barry and Ronnie and Bobby. 
[03:43:00]  And Ricky and Mike.  And if I love the girl, who cares who you like?  Ed, Special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  Cause he's a little bit better.  Just a little bit better.  Hey.  I thought college life was great. 
[03:43:30]  Ed could count from one to two.  I like people and the party scene.  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner.  Special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now his favorite color is the radio.  Cause he's a little bit better.  Just a little bit. 
[03:44:00]  One day talking to Special Ed.  He grabbed a brick and he swung at my head.  And as he laughed at me, that's when I knew  that Special Ed just made me special too.  My shoes hurt.  Now I laugh as I count bugs. 
[03:44:30]  I give strangers great big hugs.  Next to me, it is fine.  Yeah, he's a fucking Einstein.  Oh, Special Ed and me.  Now we're not right in the head, you see.  Now we're not so, not so right.  Instead, we're a little bit special.  Now, just a little bit special. 
[03:45:00]  That fucker Ed made me special.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit special.  Don't laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  You stop laughing at me. 
[03:45:30]  And that's my channel.  Don't laughing at me.  Holy Ed.  That's a clip I've never heard before.  Was that Julia Lewis?  Why did you do that?  Why did you do that?  Everyone laughing at me.  I'm sorry.  I don't think everybody's loud. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, and Giovanni Ravisi.  Giovanni Ravisi, who plays the retarded character in every movie he's in.  Let's play Name the Retard.  I don't want to ever see you again.  Yeah, Steven.  You're pissed off.  Sorry, Opie.  You're pissed off a lot of our listeners.  You're stupid.  You're pissed off a lot of our listeners.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  With that song.  Dad!  Ma'am, I apologize.  Best movie ever.  Oh, The Other Sister.  That one's great. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, man.  I like the other one where Giovanni Ravisi plays the retarded soldier.  What movie is that?  Oh, Saving Private Ryan.  Wow.  Or the other one where he plays the retarded stock trader.  Boiler Room.  Boiler Room.  Yeah, that was a good one, too.  He does play the same role.  Same retarded.  I'm a soldier.  I'm a medic.  You're a shot.  I will help you.  I'm sorry.  I don't make anybody laugh. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  Jesus.  So!  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't want to see you, either.  I go poopy.  All right.  Hey, Brendan, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Jesus Christ.  You remember Columbine, whenever they said, how did those two guys meet?  Yes.  I think you guys.  I don't know how the hell they got four of the most offensive people in the world together  in the same room, but God bless you guys. 
[03:47:30]  You guys are excellent.  All right.  Thank you, mister.  See you.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mississippi.  This sounded like radio rocks.  You go all over the country.  Mississippi.  What's up, Mississippi?  Hey, y'all mentioned the Special Olympics.  I heard a story yesterday.  What you might find interesting.  There's a, I guess he's a congressional candidate or something from Ripley, Tennessee, handing  out flyers that had a Special Olympian body on it and had George W. Bush's head morphed 
[03:48:00]  onto it.  And the caption on it said, voting for George W. Bush is like running in the Special Olympics.  Even if you win, you're still retarded.  Wow.  Using that old joke.  Still a great ad, though, for a politician to hand out.  You've got to respect that.  Sure.  Why not?  That's gumption or stupidity.  I love it.  All right.  And not the Anthony in the studio.  It's the Anthony on the phone.  Oh.  What's up, Anthony?  Hey.  How you doing, boys?  Hey.  You guys killed me with that fucking clip from the other sister. 
[03:48:30]  Are you crazy?  Holy shit.  I just almost crashed into a tree on a Grand Central.  You're nuts.  I love the other sister movie.  Oh, my God.  Juliette Lewis is so fucking hot as a retard.  I want to bang her ass.  Juliette Lewis playing a retard.  I know.  You know something?  You never see a hot retard.  Retarded American.  That's right.  I don't know what to call him.  A special person.  Yes.  Mentally handicapped.  Sitcom writer.  Special person. 
[03:49:00]  You never see them.  They're never hot.  Chromosome lacking.  It's nice to see one without that large skull you can take home and get to know.  Big, oversized tongue.  Mmm.  It's hot.  Yeah, I see her there.  Juliette Lewis.  She's trying to be a rock star now.  You see that, Steven?  I did see that.  Yes.  Well, even better than...  All right.  That's good.  We have to talk about the Christina Aguilera, too, really fast. 
[03:49:30]  Christina.  She's got the nurses across America all pissed off because in the latest Skechers ad...  They pulled the ad now.  They got Christina Aguilera looking like a naughty nurse.  In a naughty nurse outfit, which I had said I don't find attractive, the nurse thing, because  it's a fetish that...  It pretty much means you want something shoved in your butt, like an enema or a thermometer  or something, it doesn't do anything for...  Mmm.  Mmm.  Yeah.  This time tomorrow, you'll be healthier still. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  It just doesn't do anything for me, that whole nurse outfit.  But she wears it well.  So why are they mad?  You know, she dresses up like the naughty nurse for a Skechers ad, and it's been shelled  after complaints from America's nursing body.  The Dirty Singer dons a skimpy nurse's outfit and suspenders for the naughty and nice  themed ad in which she threatens to inject her injured doppelganger, who is  suffering from a sore head and knee.  How would they prefer to be portrayed?  Maybe as a bisexual male in Jersey who smothers his elderly patients? 
[03:50:30]  Self-righteous assholes.  Oh boy.  Sandy Summers, Executive Director of the Center for Nursing Advocacy.  Everyone has a title now.  Everyone has a group.  Everyone has Letterhead now.  A little group to help out just in case someone offends you.  You have a group you can run to that can send out some letters on official Letterhead,  and you can stop anything that's entertaining, fun, interesting to look at, hot.  All that stuff goes away.  What's the complaint, exactly?  Yeah, I don't even know what the complaint could be. 
[03:51:00]  Summers says, this ad simultaneously exploits the naughty nurse and the battle-axe nurse ratchet  stereotypes, setting the nurse up both as an available sex object and a mock authority  figure rather than a competent professional.  What's the name of the organization?  We're not smart enough to be Doctors Incorporated?  Shut your faces!  God almighty, who cares?  I changed my deadpan.  Exactly.  I changed my deadpan, whatever you want. 
[03:51:30]  Forget it.  You sure did a...  I changed my stoic face.  You used a nice bedpan delivery on that.  That was awful.  That was awful.  Oh, brother.  Wow.  Mike from Jersey, what's up?  The problem with these nurses is they're probably not as hot as Chris Cannon.  They're probably all a bunch of fat hands.  That's why they're phony, you know, just sitting there.  Yeah, you rarely see a hot nurse like that.  I'm sorry, nurses, if you're offended or anything, but you rarely see the hot nurse in the hot nurse 
[03:52:00]  outfit.  Well, I don't know, Mike.  My apartment is pretty hot, though.  All right, we've got to let you go because the phone is really, really bad.  It's usually, take these, pay them.  Mm-hmm.  All right, well...  Then they leave.  Let's jump around the phones a little bit.  Bernardo, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Yeah, that dildo trick you guys played last week?  Yeah.  The drill-do, yes.  Yeah, my chick got so fucking excited.  She started blowing me while we were driving. 
[03:52:30]  I had to mention I was a little hard on.  She was like, oh, wow, what's this?  Yeah, that dildo thing was out of control.  She heard the dildo bit and decided to go down on you in the car?  Yeah, as Norton would say.  She sounds like a good sport, sir.  Wow, really?  Yeah, my chick's good, dude.  She likes it.  I'll say she is.  I wonder how this...  I just had to let you guys know, thank you very much for coming back on the air.  I've been waiting for two years for this shit.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Thanks, fella.  I wonder how this is all going to read in the New York Times. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, that's right.  Oh, man.  God, New York Times guy is still here.  I didn't even realize that.  Read what you got so far.  Yeah, read it back.  The caption, garbage, exclamation point.  Right.  This should not be allowed.  Oh, no.  I can see it now.  You know, the Times, you know, pretty high-end paper.  I think it was good, though, when you played the retarded noises, I'm sure that...  Oh, that's right.  I'm sure he didn't notice that as he was writing as fast as I've ever seen a human write before.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't think I have anybody allowed. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Is this going to be in Sunday's times?  You can just nod, because I know you don't want to be on the air.  Two Sundays.  So next Sunday.  A week from Sunday.  A week from Sunday.  So that would be nine days from now.  Norton.  Plenty of time.  N-O-R-T-O-N.  Plenty of time.  That's all that matters.  And I am the head of my household.  I'm the king of my castle.  You can write that down in your paper.  Hey, Ken, what's up? 
[03:54:00]  What's going on, man?  There was a wow this morning on Fox 5, a live weather show.  I heard about that.  Really?  With some golfer.  Yeah, it was actually me.  What do you mean?  What happened?  There was just a wow sign on live TV today?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I woke up this morning, because I live in Ocean Grove, and that's where Fox 5 was this  morning.  Yeah.  So I kind of jumped out of bed and bolted over there, and I just printed up some ghetto-ass  sign and went over there and got it on the broadcast.  What I did was I put, I had high in size like 36 font, and then wow in like size 600 font 
[03:54:30]  in like three pieces of paper.  And I told the guy that I wanted to say hi to my mom in Australia, and when they panned  in for the live shot, I flipped the sign over.  Oh, you rock.  That's the way to do it.  You're a good egg, sir.  Everything is starting to come together, slowly but surely.  We're getting the wow on live TV again.  Cool.  It's definitely good to hear you guys again.  Thanks, Ken.  All right, man.  Later.  All right.  How much time we got left there, Steve?  A few minutes, at most.  It's like two minutes. 
[03:55:00]  Two minutes?  Yeah.  To me, we can't watch dumb O'Reilly groveling on Regis and Kathie Lee.  Bill O'Reilly, The O'Reilly Factor.  All right, Jay from Connecticut, I learned today Bill O'Reilly is just like everyone  else, a freaking perv.  Al Mack from the Crossroads, today I learned that once you go north of 96th Street, the  Shwoogie filter kicks in.  Jim from Philly, I learned that Clear Channel is going to get a tongue lashing like never  before.  Bob from Manhattan, I learned today people down in Tennessee don't know how to F.  Philly checking in, I learned today you could take the golfer out of Harlem, but his family 
[03:55:30]  still won't get XM.  Mormon from D.C., today I learned Lynch loves the golfers.  And Don from Binghamton, I learned today that Stephen Lynch prefers the Mocha Chicks, and  if you're a honky, you are singing the wrong tune.  Honky.  Honky.  Stephen Lynch, thanks for coming by.  Welcome back, guys.  Oh, we really appreciate that.  The DVD is live at the El Rey.  All Stephen Lynch's stuff is great, and it's being traded all over the internet, and you're 
[03:56:00]  not making a dime.  It's kind of something you've got to deal with.  I'm making my money on the tours.  There you go.  You're getting very, very famous, but you're not making no money.  You're making no money off the CD sales and the DVD sales, and it's too bad because this  stuff is really, really good.  So, Bill O'Reilly, can you show me on Kelly Ripa how you insert the dildo, just like you  did on your producer, on the phone sex with the producer?  Show me how you use the vibrator.  All right. 
[03:56:30]  Tomorrow on the show, Boston's going to try to outdo Tennessee.  That'll make sense if you're getting ready to listen to the replay.  We had Jim Norton do the Girlfriend Experience Review.  Yes, Court.  Yes.  That went very well on the show.  Yes, Court.  And Stephen Lynch.  Listened to his review.  He loved it.  And Stephen Lynch made his debut on the show today.  If you're just tuning in, you get to hear it.  Is it a debut or a reintroduction?  Reintroduction.  Right.  Debut on the new show.  How's that?  The new show.  Debut with curses.  With curses.  It's kind of a welcome back slash welcome to the new show. 
[03:57:00]  Right.  Stephen Lynch, potty mouth.  Welcome.  Aviator from opianthony.net.  I learned Red Sox fans become Pats fans when the Sox lose.  Go Pats.  Looking for it, Ben.  Cringebox checking in.  I learned that Robin now works on the O&A show, and her cackling is suddenly a lot funnier.  Oh.  Echo.  Echo from Philly.  Today, I learned that a lady of the night needs a fire hose to wash the jimmy off. 
[03:57:30]  All right.  We don't have time to do any more of these, I guess.  Yeah.  Oh.  We done, Stephen?  Yeah.  He might as well.  Really?  Yeah.  He might.  We never know when they're going to cut us off.  Well, you will actually be cut off in one minute exactly.  We'll have plenty of time to talk.  Get some calls.  All right.  Fine.  Yeah.  I mean, we want to make sure the New York Times gets our best stuff down on that notepad.  That's enough time for you to down four shots.  Oh, good.  The Jägermeister machine's showing up tomorrow. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  That's what he should do.  How much time we got left?  A beer.  You know, how much?  A shot of Jack.  All right.  That's three seconds.  I've never seen anyone drink martinis faster than Steve.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  He's just drunk.  All right.  The drunkard.  Now how much time do we have?  30 seconds.  All right.  What can we do for 30 seconds?  10 martinis.  Say hi to Earl.  How you doing, Earl?  Hey, Earl.  How are you, Earl?  You doing?  Contributing about as much as normal.  Were you hungry and didn't have any money? 
[03:58:30]  Hoping someone will foot the bill?  All right.  Jesus.  Tomorrow on the show, hopefully, we'll get the girl that was with Norton last night to give  her...  Her side of the story.  Her side of the story.  Her review of the experience.  If you listen to Norton's side, it's like a love story.  Yeah, no, she probably couldn't call in because she's vomiting in seconds.  Ben, we have anything else going on tomorrow?  Carlos Mencia.  Oh, Carlos Mencia is making his first appearance on the new show.  I've never met him.  I think he's just going to be on the phone.  Okay, so I'll still let him meet him.  We're out.  Oh, done.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:59:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my name is Amy Fisher, 5 to 15 is what I got.  I know I could have gotten more, but I'm such a lousy shot. 
[03:59:30]  I cracked my car up 14 times, I really should be dead.  But it's kind of hard to see the road while giving Joey head.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen.  Hey, get me another beer. 
[04:00:00]  How about, oh, my name is Woody Allen.  Fucking Woody, man.  He's already chucked after.  How many people think me is telling the truth about her?  You think she is?  Really?  I think she's full of fucking shit.  Who the fuck knows?  He's fucking the 20-year-old.  Why would he mess with the fucking kids, you know?  I don't know.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen. 
[04:00:30]  I'm an actor and a clown.  I learned my family values from watching Murphy Brown.  Even I have to admit my career is on the skids, but I'm coming back with a movie.  Honey, I fuck the kids.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen.  Oh, my name is Woody Allen.  The Technophile. 
[04:01:00]  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  Self-service video stores are beginning to pop up nationwide.  You walk into a lobby full of machines, enter your card, watch a trailer or two,  press a couple of buttons, and a DVD pops out.  Rental fees are about $1 for six hours and $2.50 for a 24-hour period.  The company is called Movie Bank USA and is opening facilities in New York, Boston, LA, and other major cities.  Large apartment and office buildings are also likely candidates for self-service movie rental machines.  The DVD rental market is going to be drastically changed as on-demand services appear from the likes of cable providers and the folks at TiVo. 
[04:01:30]  Content distributors are salivating over new portable media centers, which are essentially iPods for video.  Digital rights management will be key, but consumers will balk if it's too restrictive  and doesn't allow you to take your movies and TV shows with you on the road.  For more on portable media centers, do a search on Google.  I'm LAZLOW.com, and that's what's on my underground hard drive.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.
