<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts lamenting their tax burdens, using a "frog in boiling water" analogy to describe the gradual depletion of their income.  They then opened the lines to listener calls. Pat from Staten Island called to celebrate his son's marriage.  The hosts teased an upcoming 5 pm concert announcement.  Several subsequent callers shared nostalgic stories about Long Island strip clubs, detailing dancers, music (including one caller mentioning "Hell's Bells" by AC/DC), and the overall atmosphere.  Kevin described his first experience at the Tender Trap, while Emily, a former exotic dancer, recounted her time dancing and the need to quit for a "real job" after deceiving her parents.

The broadcast then took a jarring turn with a discussion about a graphic image of a suicide they’d received. This segued into promoting an upcoming show featuring a naked model contest and the appearance of comedian Stephen Lynch. A caller, Jay, shared details of his sexual experiences with pregnant women, detailing specific sexual positions. Another caller expressed a desire to meet Tara at the next show.

At 5 pm, "Ben the Fag" announced the concert: Tom Petty at Irving Plaza.  The show then featured an interview with Vince McMahon of the WWF. They discussed WrestleMania, wrestler injuries, McMahon's on-screen persona and audience reactions, his methods of creating drama, and his responses to criticism of the show's content.  Specific wrestlers like The Undertaker and China were also mentioned.  Stephen Lynch then called in, initially feigning a casual conversation before promoting his upcoming shows.

The next segment opened with a discussion about the hosts' experiences with charities, highlighting the ironic rejection of their large ($100,000) donation by some organizations due to their reputation – with one charity even claiming they'd prefer a specific disease to their involvement.  This contrasted with their donation to a charity with a name referencing crack cocaine and prostitutes.  The conversation shifted back to Vince McMahon, focusing on an A&E special showing Bret Hart punching McMahon.  McMahon called in to explain his perspective, stating that Hart's refusal to follow instructions led to the physical altercation, which he even allowed to happen. He also mentioned an accidental ankle injury inflicted by a crew member that exacerbated his injury.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the incident and McMahon's relationship with Bret Hart, followed by another call from Stephen Lynch promoting his shows at Caroline's Comedy Club, and exchanging humorous banter with the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Every place that I put things to put them in a safe place, and it's not there.  No.  I don't know where it is.  I found a W-200, the McDonald's wrappers in my car.  I'm not kidding.  It's just a mess.  You know, when you move states halfway through the tax year like we did, then you've got to deal with that.  It's just a big pain.  It's just a...  I mean, trust me, we didn't make a lot of money last year, but why bother making any money?  They just take it all anyway.  I know.  They figure out ways to get it all from you. 
[00:00:30]  Why try to advance yourself financially?  No, the way the country's built up, they penalize you for achieving any type of American dream.  The more successful you get, the more you're penalized.  Correct.  To the point of...  I think they like it that way.  The government, you know, the whole...  I'm into the whole conspiracy thing, I'll be.  But I think they like keeping people where they are constantly worried about bills and how they're going to raise their family.  They pay their mortgages and drive to work and they might not like their jobs. 
[00:01:00]  Just keep everybody in this constant state of, all right, we're kind of unhappy, but it's okay because it's worse than a lot of other places on the earth.  Right.  Because then it keeps you from having these idle ideas that you might get, like, wow, this kind of sucks.  You know, that we're paying so much taxes.  So, you know, you don't rebel.  It just amazes me that, in general, we don't speak up on taxes. 
[00:01:30]  We just take it.  We all bend over and just take it.  Because they take a little during the year.  If you really sat down and thought about all the taxes we truly pay, it's frightening.  You know what it is?  It's a great little analogy, Opie.  The way that we're taxed in this country is like if you take a frog and throw him into a pot of boiling water, he's going to freak out.  Probably try to jump out of the pot, right?  Sure.  But if you put him in there and the water's cool and then turn the fire on and slowly heat it up, he'll stay in there until he cooks. 
[00:02:00]  He won't even notice until he's dead and cooked.  That's a good analogy.  That's how we're taxed.  If at the end of the year they sent a bill that said you owe this much money, we'd freak out.  People would be going to jail because you'd have spent the money in this.  This is too much money.  Right.  But every week they take some out.  They take a little bit out.  Which is a lot.  But it's just enough where you're pissed, but you're not ready to pull out the guns and rebel.  But when you see what they take at the end of the year, and then you do your tax and you're like, oh, thank God, I'm getting back $250. 
[00:02:30]  It's like, you're not getting back to $250.  They raked you for thousands.  It's extortion is what it is.  It is.  You're paying protection money to the boss, which is the government, for police protection and roads.  It's, you know, you better pay up or there's going to be a lot of potholes on your road.  You better pay up or there's a crook come in your house.  Well, the potholes are still on my roads.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  I don't know.  It is.  So now you pay your tax dollars, and we got to watch a little inaction last night.  I think I paid for a rivet on one of the cruise missiles.  That was a multi-thousand dollar rivet.  Yeah, that's an interesting little situation as well.  Well, I don't know.  I think we're primed for a rebellion.  Who's going to lead it?  I was going to say, you want to lead the way?  I'm very busy.  Yeah, exactly.  You want to throw out the first phone call?  Yeah, what do we got? 
[00:03:30]  I have no idea.  We'll just plunk one down.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 if you got something.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, Ope.  And everyone.  Who's this?  The whole gang.  Pat from Staten Island.  Who?  Pat from Staten Island.  What do you got, Pat?  I wanted to rent my kids here to play the game.  Yeah.  Well, I had a kid today.  They got married.  Can you please say congratulations to Joe and D?  All right.  Well, you just said it.  We listen to you guys every day.  Well, you're live on the air.  I'm live on the air.  Yeah, what do you want to say to them?  Uh, congratulations to my son, Joe and D, and good luck. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  That's great.  Good luck.  Really?  Thank you guys so much.  Are you having a little party right now?  Oh, yeah.  We're partying.  I can't talk, right?  You can say asses.  Oh, well, we're partying our asses off.  All right.  Cool.  Oh, thank you so much.  Congratulations to you guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  There you go.  We threw up the first call.  There it was.  Cute little congratulatory.  Doesn't belong on this station.  It's like, okay, we'll play a song for the happy couple.  White Wedding.  Hi, N.E.W. 
[00:04:30]  There you go.  Yeah.  Very good.  There's the second one.  We're off to a great start today.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Okay.  Very good.  Is that working?  Yeah, it's working.  All right.  We got a major concert announcement.  We're going to be thrown out to the folks at 5 o'clock today.  Oh, we do?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  I don't know what it is, but.  I don't either.  I think Ben the Fag's going to come in and announce a really cool show.  I was hoping it was right here, because then I was going to tell you now. 
[00:05:00]  Because I hate when they tease and say it.  Coming up at 5 o'clock, we have the info in the studio, but we're not going to tell you  for the next two hours, so you're stuck listening to the station.  I swear, if I had it, I would give it right now, but I don't.  We'll try to find out what it is before 5 and busted.  If not, Ben will be in here at 5 to tell everyone, okay?  All right.  All right.  On the way, we got Matchbox 20.  Eric Clapton next.  Now the phone's ringing like crazy.  We'll go to those next.  You can send faxes, 212-957-WNEW.  And our instant feedback, I don't know if it's working today. 
[00:05:30]  Let me take a quick look here.  Nah, it's not working yet.  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York, Matchbox 20.  And 3 a.m., it's Opie and Anthony on the way, Collective Soul.  Handsome Tom Petty by request.  We'll take care of that.  Hey.  In just a bit, a lot of people are calling and begging us not to talk about taxes.  I know.  It's like, please, we're stressed out enough.  People are going, come on, man.  We listened to you guys for a little relief.  And a lot of us are dealing with our taxes just like you guys.  We don't want to hear it. 
[00:06:00]  I feel your pain.  Yeah, I don't blame you guys.  All right.  We'll try not to talk about how the government is raping us.  Giving us the big one.  The big sausage.  But Gary, on the instant feedback here, he claims to be a former friend of Anthony.  Yes.  I know Gary, man.  He recognized the last name and everything there.  Oh, yeah.  I haven't seen him in years.  We used to work together at Deutsch Relays.  What did you do there?  Out on Long Island.  Yeah.  I started out in fabrication.  I was making these little metal pieces. 
[00:06:30]  And then one day, all the bosses had gathered around.  And I figured out how to take all these little metal pieces and clamp them into one clamp and drill holes in them.  And they were fascinated by this.  So they made me an inspector.  So I have my little micrometer and calipers.  And I used to inspect the people's work.  Don't gorillas do that in the zoo?  When they're teaching a gorilla, like, how to, you know, communicate and stuff.  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:00]  They were really fascinated.  Oh, yeah.  They're looking and going, wow, this guy.  Well, most of the people that were working in the production end of it were pretty much, you know, I guess it's an entry-level position.  And they were just drilling one piece at a time, Opie.  Yeah.  For years and years, they would drill one piece at a time.  And then I guess I must have been a rocket scientist to figure out if you put five in a clamp, you could do five.  That's cool.  Yeah.  So then I was in the inspection department with Gary and Larry. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  Another pal.  Well, Gary writes, Anthony, you should tell a story about when you were at the train station waiting for someone.  And that crazy, effed-up hick was screwing around with you.  And you reached under your seat and pulled the BB gun out and said, okay, cowboy, back up.  Very funny story.  You'll have to spice it up a bit, Larry and Gary.  I must have been intoxicated.  You don't remember that?  I don't remember doing that.  Sounds a little dangerous, doesn't it? 
[00:08:00]  Well, maybe.  What if he had an actual firearm?  Well, maybe if Gary's listening, he could help you remember the story.  I don't, wow.  I remember, um, no, I don't remember that.  I don't remember doing that.  God, how trashed were you?  That whole time of my life is a blur.  Yeah.  That was like just prior to my homeless period, Opie, that you might remember me talking about on the air a month ago.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So, um, no, I don't remember the BB gun incident. 
[00:08:30]  Okay.  Sorry.  That's all right.  I do remember his father, um, I believe his father was, uh, some Japanese export guy.  And in like 1981, Gary gives me these little headphones and goes, put this on and listen to this.  Now, prior to that, you're used to these big clunker headphones.  You plug into your stereo and listen to your 8-track.  Right, right.  But it was a Walkman.  The first Walkman ever.  So, I'm like, oh, this is like stereo sound.  This is amazing.  So, it's like, yeah, Gary had the first, uh, Walkman ever. 
[00:09:00]  Not bad.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Okay.  Thank you, Gary, for that, uh, hallucination that I don't remember.  Yeah.  And Jim from Jersey wants to hear the Hillary and Chelsea bit again.  See, man, I'm, we're really trying to figure out our, our faithful listeners.  Yeah.  Because every day we get email from people saying, you know, um, you guys play your bits too much in a week.  But then we get a whole bunch of other people that only heard part of the bit or heard it from a friend that it was cool and they want to hear it. 
[00:09:30]  Or they just want to hear it again because it was funny.  Yeah.  So, I never know what to do in this, uh, situation.  Mm.  I'm assuming there's a lot of people out there right now listening to us that have not heard the Hillary and Chelsea bit from Africa.  Right.  Want to just blow it out early, real fast here?  Yeah, we played it midway through the show, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, we might as well.  All right, Rick.  Rick, get the Hillary and Chelsea thing.  We're going to play that one last time early.  Then we'll retire it.  A guy who knows Anthony from the topless bar?  Topless?  Oh, jeez. 
[00:10:00]  What, are people going to come out of the woodwork now?  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how you doing?  All right, who's this?  This is Kevin.  What do you got on Anthony, man?  Hey, I was wondering if you remember the tea joint around a block from Deutsche Relay over there on Jericho.  Um, let's see.  What's it, the Ravens, uh?  Wait, I, I do know that.  No, it's not the Ravens.  The Tender Trap.  The Tender Trap or something?  The Tender Trap.  The Tender Trap.  That's where I got my first booby dance from.  I went in there when I was, I believe, just a tot.  I was going to say, what year did you graduate?  With a handful of quarters. 
[00:10:30]  Well, I never graduated.  Oh, you know.  When were you supposed to graduate high school?  My tenure at John H. Glenn High School.  Ended abruptly.  Yes, ended abruptly.  Actually, I was having such a good time, I stayed an extra year, and I still didn't cut the mustard with them over there.  What year was that?  What was that, 81?  81, okay.  So, yeah, so you were on the same age, so you're, you're, uh, 30.  Well, the funny thing about that, uh, what, your principal, Anthony, told you that you were wasting your time in school.  Yeah.  Yeah, he came up to me and said, uh, Anthony, why don't you just take the rest of the year off and come back next year? 
[00:11:00]  You're just wasting your time.  You're not doing anything.  And the first thing, I'm just thinking, yeah, I'm out.  You're done.  The principal told me to leave for a year.  I was happy.  And then I came back the next year and made a real, uh, good, uh, effort the first week.  I actually had books and carried them to class, had my pencils.  Yeah.  And then a week went by and I was just like, where's the pot?  This is a waste.  I gotta smoke another doobie.  There you go.  The tender trap's still happening. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't been there in a while, but, um, yeah, I went there with a pocket full of quarters, threw them down.  And, uh, that was my first experience with, um, with a titty bar.  They used to have the rug act.  That's what she was doing.  They just don't have the rug act anymore.  She had her little quilt that must've been on her bed from ninth grade.  And she, uh, yeah, she lays it down on the stage and she, and the girls have to go to the jukebox and play their own music in these places.  No DJ.  So she clicks, you know, gets there and then she's got to wait while the music starts. 
[00:12:00]  We got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  Let's make it last.  And I'm just, oh, this is beautiful.  She saw her legs are up in the air and apart together, roll over belly, smack her ass.  And I'm milking that beer for an hour and a half.  And they used to use the hand lotion really well.  Oh, yeah.  Remember the old...  They just... 
[00:12:30]  What the heck?  Squeeze it on their chest.  What the heck is that about, man?  Rub.  Then there was, like, the circus act girl that could put the matches on her nips and light them.  Yeah, and that cost her, what, five, ten bucks?  It's like, wow, that was worth it.  Thanks.  I don't know.  Back then it was just a buck, man.  The girl came around.  It wasn't like...  It wasn't the lap dance thing.  You could just sat there with the usual suspects.  And she would come around and you'd give her a buck.  And she'd dance a little in front of you and go to the next guy.  Yeah.  And you'd have to pick your seat. 
[00:13:00]  If you got one guy with a pile of dollars, you'd sit next to him and you'd just hone in on his dancing.  Of course.  And there was always the usual guys.  You know, there's the naive guy who thought he was going to get some from, hey, she's smiling at me.  He's just forking over the box.  The old guy who just sits in the corner.  The guy in the suit.  You know, he came from work.  Right.  The construction guy.  And you'd just sit there and, you know, watch the girl dance around.  Now they pressure you too much.  They're always in your face and you're trying to get like fives and tens and stuff. 
[00:13:30]  It used to be easy.  Making you drink.  Yeah.  You want another $12 beer?  No, I'm nursing this one pretty well.  This is okay.  I'm just wetting my lips with this.  Yeah.  But for me, well, you remember We've Got Tonight.  We've Got Tonight.  Oh, she's beautiful.  My first experience, we've talked about this on the air before, it was just a nightmare.  It was Danny's Den, which is now a parking lot for, I think, King Cullen.  Also on Jericho.  Also on Jericho.  I was 18, went in there with the boys for my 18th birthday. 
[00:14:00]  And the music starts up.  First of all, I sat on some guy's lap.  Ew, what?  Well, not on purpose.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Let me explain.  I hope he went to a male strip club.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  Ooh.  You know, when you're like, especially like the Tender Trap and Danny's Den, back, you  know, back then the real seedy strip clubs were really dark.  Yeah.  So if you're going during the day, like we did at this particular time, it's, you know,  sunny blue sky, and all of a sudden you walk into the place, and it's like you're going 
[00:14:30]  into a bat cave, and you're feeling around, trying to get a seat, and also I'm like, oh,  sorry, sir.  I found a seat that wasn't occupied.  It was like I was giving the guy a lap dance or anything you asked.  He slipped a buck in your undies there.  That's what happened.  So then we sit down, we order our $10 beers, and the song starts.  And it's, there is a house in New Orleans, they call the rising sun. 
[00:15:00]  John Valby was singing it?  Yeah.  Got that little John Valby working in my voice.  But then I'm like, wow, this is really cool, you know?  And I really started looking at the girl, because from a distance, she looked good.  And then I'm like, I start screaming.  I'm like, oh, my God.  That cesarean scar, just nasty.  Oh, she had the C-section, yeah.  Just nasty across the belly, and it was just like, ugh.  It kind of ends the dancing career, yeah.  This is what the, this is what strip clubs were all about.  I was kind of bummed.  They were all like crack whores and stuff, you know? 
[00:15:30]  I've seen some good ones, though.  At the Trap, at the Den, out there on the island, Brass Monkey.  Remember that place?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I've seen some good ones out there.  A few and far between.  Right.  But, yeah.  But I think every guy, and probably some ladies out there as well, there's that one song that  just brings them right back to pretty much the first time they were in that strip club,  you know?  It's true, man.  All right.  Well, now we wasted time.  Now we can't play the Chelsea and Hillary thing.  No.  Well, this is cool. 
[00:16:00]  We'll do it this way.  If you guys want to stick around, and you didn't hear the Chelsea and Hillary thing, we'll  definitely play that next.  Okay?  And if you've heard it a lot, you can flip around the dials and listen to some boring  radio for a while.  Or listen to the talents that are on the air.  The what?  Hey, all the talent.  It's on the air out there.  Ho, ho!  Hey, how about that?  All right.  I don't know what's going on.  Man, everyone wants to talk about strip clubs now, too. 
[00:16:30]  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how's it going?  Are opening Anthony's there?  Hey.  Yeah, we're right here, live.  You're live on the air.  Oh, hey, how's it going?  Listen, I wanted to do a Tender Trap story for you.  Okay.  I'm from Northport.  I live in Jersey now.  But Tender Trap is like the all-time best go-go bar in the entire known universe.  The girls there are...  Really?  I mean, it's like the only place where, like, the girls get up on stage there and, like,  dance right in your face. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, I haven't been there in a long time.  Yeah, neither have I.  It's been a bunch of years for me, too.  But, you know, like, no matter how raunchy girls get at bars like that, they don't let  you touch, right?  Right.  Well, I'm going to put this, like, real carefully so that you can put it on the air and everything.  But, like, the girl that came up on the bar, I gave her a nice fiver or whatever, and she...  Well, let me back up a little bit.  What she did first was she, like, took everything off and she, like, put this little scarf around 
[00:17:30]  her waist because it was supposed to be bottomless.  Right.  That clever ruse.  Right.  That lasted for about a week in the bars before they caught on to that one.  Right.  So what happened was she was up on the bar and basically had nothing on.  And I gave her a nice one or a five or whatever in her garter there that she had around her  thigh.  Right.  And she kind of, like, squatted down and did things on my hand.  For five bucks.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Isn't that great?  It was unbelievable.  You've got to love that.  Why don't they allow that in bars?  I mean, they wrecked everything.  I mean, who's that hurting if you want to pay five bucks and have a girl sit on your  hand?  Right.  I mean, come on.  And some politician at some point in New York decided that they're going to ban bottomless.  Right.  So, like, what politician could ever bring it back now?  Right.  You can't run with the, and I'll get bottomless back.  Right.  You know, politicians have to understand, once they make a move like that, it's irreversible. 
[00:18:30]  It's over.  It'll never come back.  Right.  And then now the bottomless places, if you go, they only serve Jews, and that's no fun.  No.  You know, if they're afraid, what, that sex and booze are going to get guys too rowdy  and stuff, right?  Oh, I thought that you said they only serve Jews.  And I said, oh, oh, I see.  All right.  But I just wanted to let you know, the fellow Long Island boy who's been displaced in New  Jersey that...  All right.  So, I've got to ask you this real fast.  What is the song you hear on the radio that reminds you of that first strip club experience? 
[00:19:00]  Um...  I think every guy has the song in their head.  I don't know.  It's got to be, like, not when the girl was on the bar, but, like, you were talking about  the rug thing before with songs like Who's Got That Love and Feeling, and...  Oh, you lost that love and feeling.  Oh, look at the way she's flittering her legs.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, and spreading them and trying to make, you know, like, show her wares, if you will.  Her balloon knot.  Right.  So, it's, uh, you've lost that love and feeling for you, right? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, that's a good one.  I mean, like, that's the one that, you know, that they're always, uh, writhing around on  the floor and, uh, you know, making like they're doing it with whoever.  Yeah.  That's a good one for the floor.  And then they got to do, like, the pole one where they strut around, like, I'm so excited.  Right.  And I just can't hide.  And they're, like, they're doing the fast, like, like what they learned in ninth grade ballet  or something when they thought they were going to be pro dancers.  Well, now, uh, in the strip clubs, it's all the 80s music. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's where the 80s music went.  All the hair bands and stuff definitely came back.  It's a really, I haven't been to a strip club in a while.  Yeah.  I'm married with children now.  Well, maybe.  Uh, Al Bundy.  You need it more than ever, then.  Tell me about it.  All right.  Uh, I want to let you guys know that you guys are great.  You know, I want to give you kudos.  Oh, thanks.  And I also want to let you know that, like, I'm a big, uh, Howard fan.  Yes.  And you guys are, like, totally cool, uh, doing your own thing and everything.  And, um, shouldn't be an O.B. and Anthony against, uh, Howard thing like that. 
[00:20:30]  No, we're not.  We're all one big happy family, CBS family.  Welcome home.  Yeah, we're really not trying to, to, to separate the audience.  But if he's going to attack us, we're not scared to fight back.  That's what that's about.  I don't know.  I haven't heard him diss you.  And if he has, well, whatever.  He has a bunch of times.  You know, we grew up listening to him.  We've told everyone that.  And that's, that's all people need to know.  Right.  We respect him.  We think, uh, he's paved the way for a lot of guys, of course.  But we're doing our own thing over here, man.  That's right, Robin.  You guys are cool.  You guys are entertaining in the afternoon.  And who needs all those songs that we've heard 185,000 times anyway? 
[00:21:00]  I've got a whole bunch of CDs.  Well, we've got a couple of those coming up next, so.  That's okay, too.  That's okay, too.  But hearing you guys rap is cool, too.  Hey, man, thanks.  Have a good one.  All right, East Northport.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  All right.  Let's take a quick break here.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNW.  Collective soul and heavy off dosage.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oi.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We've got Emily on the line here, who used to dance at strip clubs.  Oh.  Where?  Emily.  Hi. 
[00:21:30]  Hi.  We've got you live on the air.  Good.  What's up?  Oh, I just, I'm laughing, listening to you guys, thinking about the songs, because I'm  thinking about the first time I ever danced, which was about a year and a half ago.  And it was ACDC's Hell's Bells.  I'll never forget it.  So you came on the stage for the first time to Hell's Bells, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was so funny.  I had no idea I was going to do it.  I'd go to strip clubs with my friends all the time, because, you know, all guys flipped  out.  Oh, wow.  A hot chick getting lap dances.  So I liked the attention.  So it was funny.  That's always how it starts. 
[00:22:00]  They dared me.  And I said, okay, but I can't dance to save my life.  So I asked you.  There's no dancing.  It doesn't matter.  There's no dancing.  There's no dancing at all.  Of course.  Take your wiggle there.  Give me money.  Yeah.  It's not like a burlesque show.  It's all about just checking out girls nude.  I love the girls that really get into it and make believe they've really got some moves  going on.  No.  It's not about that anymore.  Just jiggle.  It's not about dancing.  It's not about anything.  It's about, you know, wow, you've got a nipple ring, you know?  Yeah.  What's your move?  Do you have a special move or anything?  Oh, goodness.  I don't know. 
[00:22:30]  I moved every single which way you could think of.  Do you do the little ass smack where you put the ass in the guy's face and then you  turn around, you look at him, and then you smack your ass and strut away?  That's got to be the top move in the strip clubs in the 90s.  Oh, please.  I used to have red marks on my ass all night.  Did you do a rug act?  We never used rugs.  Yeah.  They don't do it anymore.  Yeah, that's right.  She started a year and a half ago, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  You still dancing?  No, I had to stop.  I live at home, rent-free, and I had to, like, light on my turns to where I was, and it 
[00:23:00]  was just killing me.  How old are you?  23.  23.  Nice bod and everything?  Oh, yeah.  I'm a hot chick.  Well, you can always come in and strip for, you know, dance for us.  How much are you going to give me?  We'll play Hell's Bells, and we can reenact the first time for you.  Oh, I might cry.  I'll have tears in my eyes.  All right.  Well, thanks, Emily.  Thanks a lot.  Do you miss the strip clubs, or?  I do.  You do.  Why did you have to stop?  I mean, well, she felt guilty.  She was lying to her parents.  Was that it?  She was lying to her parents.  I'm lying to my parents where I am, 4 o'clock every morning, you know, and they're going,  you're really going out with your friends, and I had to, like, have some excuses to 
[00:23:30]  where I was getting money, so I had to get a real job.  Hey, did any guys ever come in that you went to school with?  Even funnier, I ended up getting a real job, about a month later, two weeks into the  job, my boss comes up to me and says, I know you, but you don't know where I know  you from.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oopsie.  Yeah.  Was it a good temper?  I don't even remember.  Okay.  Very nice, Emily.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Okay, bye-bye.  A little insight from the other side of the stage, Opie. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, Emily checking in.  All right, let's get the Chelsea and Hillary thing on.  Okay.  What's the setup on this damn thing?  Well, they were recently in Africa, visiting, as they have in the past.  I don't know what she's doing.  I like that one.  So wrong.  All right.  We got Stevie Ray Vaughan up next.  Oh, God.  What?  They just...  What happened?  Someone sent me a picture of that guy that jumped off the building. 
[00:24:30]  What, at Harley Davidson Cafe a few weeks ago?  Let's see.  Is it really the picture?  Jesus, man.  Turn this around.  Come on.  Look.  I'll tell you.  Oh, God.  Rick's looking at the picture as he eats a Whopper.  Dude, are you ready?  Yeah.  It's sick.  Get out.  Oh, God.  Come on.  Is that real?  Yes, it's real.  It looks like it was described, like someone dropped a pizza.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to puke.  I swear to God. 
[00:25:00]  I just...  Oh, my God.  His whole, like...  Man, he must have hit flat.  My mouth just started watering.  Oh, man.  That's bad.  Am I hungry?  Jesus.  That is disgusting.  Boy, people are just...  Oh, God.  It sure makes you think of how much liquid we have in us.  Now, see, if we had our website up and about, we could punch it up and everyone would be able to check that out today.  Are we going to have a website in time for tomorrow's festivities? 
[00:25:30]  I'm working on it.  We've got a very busy show tomorrow.  We've got a bunch of girls coming in to challenge Tara as the hottest girl to ever pose naked on the Opie and Anthony show.  Stephen Lynch is coming in.  We'll probably get a couple pictures up of him playing his guitar.  I'm eagerly awaiting the emailing of my server and password, Opie.  All right, so if you...  Then I will put pictures up.  Tootsweet.  All right, so if you get it while we're on the air, maybe we could punch up the picture of the guy that killed himself a few weeks ago.  Oh, man, that's just...  Isn't that disgusting?  Look at Rick eating french fries and a burger. 
[00:26:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Kenny Wayne, Shepard, Blue-Eyed Black, Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Before that, you're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Don't forget, 5 o'clock, we've got a major concert announcement.  And I hate when radio stations do that to us.  I know.  Honestly, if I knew, I would tell you right now.  But this is all we got.  I thought the info was on the page.  So at 5 o'clock, we'll have Ben come in and he'll tell you the announcement.  I'm here and it's pretty cool. 
[00:26:30]  Okay.  All right?  All right.  So you got that to look forward to.  And we're talking about a lot of things today, but a bunch of people are really into the strip club talk.  Because we're being a little nostalgic, remembering back your first time.  Yeah, and especially the first song you ever heard in a strip club.  Yeah.  For me, it was House of the Rising Sun.  Anthony, his biggest memory is You've Got Tonight by Bob Seger.  I'm talking the whole body, though. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, that's different.  His jaw drops.  His jaw drops.  His mouth's hanging open.  He's like, ah, ah, ah.  The dance should make matters worse if we buy him a lap dance.  Oh, no.  You guys are cruel.  Corky gets a lap dance.  You would have done the same thing if you'd seen it.  Oh, boy.  I got to get some of these boobies.  Oh, I like this.  That's enough, Bill.  No, I need more.  It was just out of control.  He ended up groping at me. 
[00:27:30]  He thought he was getting married.  We're going to get married.  We had to turn him out of that.  That's what it's through.  Oh, my goodness.  Can you believe his phone is going out?  You still there?  There it is.  There you go.  Modern technology.  Technology.  We're dropping bombs that are guided by satellites to a target that's an inch wide.  But you can't get a phone call to go through in Manhattan.  There he goes.  He's gone.  That's great.  All right.  That's great. 
[00:28:00]  Well, you can see a smiling Bosnian waving from behind a curtain as the rocket slams into  his head.  But we can't get a phone call.  But on the West Side Highway, you can't get a phone that comes in clear here at any  W.  Great.  Technology.  Yeah, it's just like the Jetsons this 21st century.  I love it.  I wonder how Corky Steinbrenner would act in a strip club.  Oh, boy.  There's something happening with my con dog.  It's getting stale.  Imagine George in a strip club, though.  This is the best booby dancer I've ever seen. 
[00:28:30]  And to be sitting here with a pair of cans like yours is just getting out.  Oh, too much fun today.  Those are the best boobs and booby dancing.  Oh, man.  Hey, Jay.  Yes?  What do you got, Jay?  Is this the fellas?  Yeah.  Oh, obviously, he's in a monsoon. 
[00:29:00]  I want to talk about having sex with pregnant women.  Okay.  You know, I just had a baby.  And, you know, you get with a girl, you're together for a while, and sex just becomes  routine.  Yeah.  Then when she's pregnant, you get to do all different kinds of positions and stuff.  It's never the same.  It changed my whole life.  Sounds it.  What does she do?  Get a pierced belly button, and you're riding like a hoppity hop?  Nah, we didn't go that crazy.  But I'm telling you, you know, instead of just a regular standing mouse, you know what I 
[00:29:30]  mean?  Standard mouth.  It's like turtles.  You know, now you're flipping around in different positions and stuff like that.  Then she has the baby.  Yeah.  And you still get to do all that good stuff.  Very nice.  Going at it, and it sounds like one of those red kickballs.  Oh, man.  That's right.  It changed my whole relationship.  Don't let anybody ever knock pregnant women, because let me tell you something.  It helps you out.  There's a whole new life out there.  All right.  After pregnancy.  Well, thanks a lot, Jay.  Listen, I want to ask you a question. 
[00:30:00]  Uh-oh.  Two days ago was my birthday, and I want to come over and party with you guys tomorrow  and see.  I want to see Tara in person.  Well, Tara's not going to make it in tomorrow.  So how about the other girls?  What's up?  Okay.  So then the other chicks.  I don't care.  Right?  Look at them.  All right.  Hold on to the line.  We'll get you down here.  Great.  Thanks.  Hold on.  All right.  Oh, that's right.  Ben's got a concert announcement.  Oh, yeah.  Ben the fag.  Hey, Ben the fag.  What do you got?  What is it?  Ben the village people?  Regrouping?  If you're making the announcement, what? 
[00:30:30]  Right said Fred?  Wham?  Yeah.  Do you have a meshed tank top at home?  No.  All right.  Ben's too sexy for his shirt.  Too sexy for his shirt.  All right, Ben.  Too sexy.  What do you got?  All right.  This is pretty big.  WNEW presents Tom Petty, April 11th, 12th, and 15th at Irving Plaza.

[00:32:30]  Remember that old commercial with Brenda Vaccaro?  Hi, I'm Brenda Vaccaro from Playtex Tampa.  All right, we got to take a break.  I think Vince McMahon is waiting to talk.  The Rock of New York, 1027, WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And on the phone line is our pal Vince McMahon.  Vince McMahon.  From the WWF WrestleMania this Sunday.  We got to talk to Vince.  This is Cole.  I want to talk to Vince.  Mr. McMahon.  Oh, I know that's right.  Hey, there he is.  There's that voice.  It's Vinnie Mac, as everyone calls him. 
[00:33:00]  I call it a lot worse, too.  You guys know that.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  How are you?  Ready for WrestleMania?  Oh, we can't wait for Sunday.  I look forward to it.  Oh, hell yeah.  I must say that I've been a closet wrestling fan for many years.  Closet?  Well, no, I'm going to explain this, though.  But within the last year or two, now I'm really proud to say that I'm a huge wrestling fan.  That's great.  And I don't mind that people know that.  It's the best.  Raw is war.  It's the best show on TV right now.  Thank you for the compliment.  It really is.  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  I've been with you since Andre the Giant and Chief Jay Strongbow.  Wow.  You go back a ways.  And Brutus San Martino.  Sure.  And Ernie Ladd with that thumb injury.  Big cat, Ernie Ladd.  That's right.  The big cat.  He had that.  What was the deal with him?  He had that thumb injury for like five years.  It was chronic.  It was a chronic thumb injury.  You know?  It would get well, and then, you know, he'd injure it again.  He'd need the metal brace on it so he could gouge people's eyes with it.  Why don't they ever see that, Vince?  Why don't they ever see it?  You know, it's amazing.  You know, when Dr. Fuji brought out the dust in the face, the salt, why didn't the refs 
[00:34:00]  ever see that?  It's just, I guess, because they weren't supposed to.  It's the only thing I can think of, you know?  I mean.  No, but it's great.  And I was stunned like a year ago or so.  You really started making a lot of appearances.  Yeah.  And now you're a fixture.  You're like the guy.  You come out.  You got your own music.  No chance.  No chance in hell.  No chance in hell.  And Vinny walks down the ramp. 
[00:34:30]  You call that a walk or is that a strut?  You got the strut.  You got the attitude.  I know.  That's right.  We see that.  And I was laughing my ass off last week when Stone Cold brought in the beer truck and  started hosing you down.  I mean, what the hell are you going to do next, man?  Just stay tuned and find out.  I mean, it's going to be wild and crazy.  You know that.  You kill me.  You're taking a beating, too, these days.  That is for sure.  Talk about being stunned.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, I've had it occur quite often. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Any injuries?  Other than being partially paralyzed from the waist down, a broken rib and a broken wrist  over the last six months, I've been fine.  Really?  Yeah.  And they say the wrestlers don't get hurt.  Man.  That's all right.  We get up just like, you know, it's a roadrunner kind of a thing.  You know, where Wiley Coyote doesn't quite make that turn and goes down the 2,000-foot  ravine and then gets right back up.  That's how tough WWF stars are.  Now, Anthony and I are amazed at the power you got because you'll come out when the Raw's 
[00:35:30]  war starts and you will just suggest a match and the wrestlers just have to do it.  You know, it's amazing.  They fess out.  It's nice to be able to, you know, throw your weight around a little bit, you know?  We're waiting for, you know, something like, um, Cain, Mankind, in a castration match!  That's a hell of an idea.  And then just, you know...  You know, we may do that one on Monday.  The winner is the man who leaves the ring with his testicles.  And, because we're convinced they'll do it. 
[00:36:00]  All right, Vince.  Sure, why not?  What's with that, what's with that, Mankind?  If the money's right, you know, why not?  Yeah, okay.  So, what can you tell us about WrestleMania?  I can tell you it's going to be a huge, uh, creative, uh, success.  And, um, I can tell you that every WWF superstar is going to give it everything they possibly  have and that the audience will have three hours, almost three hours, of non-stop entertainment.  Wow.  Hey, what do you think of the signs? 
[00:36:30]  I mean, the signs are huge now.  I think that is just so cool because we encourage our audience, one of our secrets in terms  of audience participation, we encourage our audience to exercise fully their freedoms  of expression.  And, man, they do.  Yes, they do.  Because I've seen some that I think would be personally insulting to you, Mr. McMahon.  You know, I've seen a couple of those, but I think they're plants.  Oh, you think so?  Yeah, I mean, I don't think people really dislike that character.  I just think, you know, they're just kind of playing along, you know.  Uh, I mean, I could take it personally, you know. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But I don't.  So, who are the big name celebrities showing up Sunday?  Uh, the big name celebrities showing up Sunday would be Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Yeah.  Uh, and The Rock.  There you go.  Uh, and the big show Paul White.  And Mankind.  And Undertaker.  And Boss Man.  The list goes on and on.  In other words, the WWF superstars are the big celebrities.  All right.  I'm always wondering about The Undertaker.  You know, he's very demonic.  Yeah.  Uh, this whole, uh, I don't know, satanic thing going on.  No, no, no. 
[00:37:30]  Not satanic.  What is it?  I mean, it's just from the dark side.  Oh, from the dark side.  It's sort of like from the far side, although not quite as cartoony.  But then he's able to, you know, host something on USA, like some night of TV.  Yeah.  Like, if he was so dark, wouldn't they, uh, the network not even want to work with him?  I would think that's probably a good, uh, good observation.  I mean, you know, there he is.  He's on the sci-fi channel.  Yeah.  I was amazed.  The hell's with that?  And then he's at your house with your family.  Yeah.  I would think any boss would just, you know, there's got to be something in his 
[00:38:00]  contract that you could fire him for, uh, threatening your family's life.  He had a sort of morals clause or something.  Something.  You would think, Vince.  But once he steps over that line, whatever that line is, you know, we have to determine  that, you know, then there could be hell to pay.  It could be some awful retribution.  All right.  And what was with the teddy bear?  Uh, we're going to have to, like, wait for that to come out.  Oh, is that because I was waiting?  It's because it is like a soap opera.  Yes, it is.  You watch this and now you have to wait to the next week to see what, what, how it's going 
[00:38:30]  to play out.  It's action, adventure, soap opera, cartoon, talk show, all rolled into one.  Yeah.  If anyone, uh, didn't hear, uh, see that episode, uh, someone delivered a box to Vince McMahon.  There was a teddy bear in it.  And, uh, Vince was, uh, on all fours crying.  I was distraught.  Vince, uh, Emmy in your future, you think?  I don't know about that.  Emmy award?  I doubt it very seriously.  I know the people in the entertainment world can't figure us out, you know, and they're saying,  wait a minute, what right do these people have by being a number one thing on television?  I mean, you know, so they're not about to acknowledge it. 
[00:39:00]  I could, I could tell you that.  I mean, where do you draw your motivation from when you're on the floor, uh, weeping like  that?  I love the, I love the Vince is scared, S-less look.  Like you'll be talking all bad in the ring.  Right.  And stone cold, I'm going to kick your ass.  Right.  And then stone cold will come out and you'll, you'll make that, oh, oh, oh, it's stone  cold.  That whole look.  Well, you know, it's, it's, it's sort of like having a range, I suppose, you know?  It's a range.  It is.  Sort of like, uh, De Niro.  It's sort of like feeling the moment, you know? 
[00:39:30]  I tell you, I love it.  I love it.  I do too.  Now, Vince, on a serious side, uh, you're, you're getting a lot of heat about being, uh,  politically incorrect and all that crap.  They're doing a lot of articles on you.  I'm enjoying it.  It generally comes from, you know, uh, a few people, you know, who don't get it.  They don't understand that we're, hello, we're entertainment.  Right.  You know?  And when you compare everything that we do on television during prime time to anything  else that's on cable during prime time, you know, we're like Sunday school teachers.  Right.  Well, they're saying there's too much, uh, sex for the little kids and the joy references. 
[00:40:00]  Can you, can you, is there any such thing as too much sex?  No.  All right, very good.  Let's get that straight.  All right, very good.  So now, I mean, it's like, again, there is it, I mean, uh, you know, again, compared  to anything else that's on the television, you know, we, you know, we're, we're mild.  Right.  It's just, we've never done, you know, what we're doing now.  And this genre, so we opened the creative envelope, a lot of people don't like it, you  know, and, and they can hit that all powerful button, that little switch that switches you 
[00:40:30]  off from our station.  Right.  Off of USA onto something else.  God bless them.  They have that power.  Hallelujah.  Yeah, believe me, we're, we're in the same boat, uh, in a lot of ways.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just don't get soft on us.  Oh, no, no.  All right.  You don't have to worry about that.  Okay.  I promise.  Hey, how about that, uh, China?  Ooh.  Man.  Does she have a schlong?  No, I, I don't think so, but it's like, man, she, she's looking good these days, though.  I don't know, but there's like a man thing.  Yeah, she has a man.  Well, you gotta get past that. 
[00:41:00]  You guys gotta, you know, I mean, she's, she's got a warm heart, you know, I mean, you  gotta get past that, you know, that initial visceral aspect, you know?  She, uh, I, I at one point thought maybe she was, uh, Slaughter's daughter with the jaw.  Oh, with the jaw?  Yeah.  Yeah, and then, and then, uh, she comes back after this little vacation, and she had some  work done.  She must have.  I saw, like, the jaw is a little more, uh, tucked in.  A little more feminine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's trying for it.  I gotta give her, uh, she does have, uh, a nice butt.  Uh.  You see it there.  The rest of her ain't too shabby either. 
[00:41:30]  I don't know, the bulge, the bulge in the front is a little weird.  You don't like the bulge.  I love the bulge.  You know?  It's just a sense of imagination, you know?  Now, did she really get hurt the other day when Triple H, uh, threw that fireball?  Uh, yeah.  I mean, Kane did.  Yep, she did.  She did get hurt, uh, and she's gonna make a return, we think, at WrestleMania.  It looked like something went wrong there.  Yeah, you know, we take chances, you know, that we'll do anything to entertain our audience,  and, you know, sometimes we get hurt.  Because in, uh, slow motion, it's like, that's not fake. 
[00:42:00]  That, the fireball hit her right in the eye.  Indeed.  And, you know, she, I mean, she didn't lose her sight, so she's gonna be okay.  You know, but if we do take chances in the name of entertaining our audience, and, you know,  at the pros that we are, and we can't, there's nothing we won't do.  We'll do for our audience.  Right.  Hey, any other family members you're gonna bring into the, uh, ring?  Uh, could very well happen.  You got, uh, Shane in there, who I must say, at first he came out, uh, the storyline was, uh,  he was a good guy.  Yeah.  He was helping out a stone cold and going against his father, Vinnie Mack. 
[00:42:30]  Can you imagine that?  And everybody loved him.  And within a second, he turned into a son of a bitch.  You know what?  I guess he is the son of the father after all.  Do you guys take heat out on the street now because of your persona in the ring?  No.  I mean, our fans really get it.  I mean, in terms of performing, you know, they want to dismember us in the arena.  And as soon as the show is over, I mean, our fans really get it.  It's like, they'll even critique our performance.  Jeez, Vince, I think you could have been a little more dramatic here at this point. 
[00:43:00]  Vince, I love the, the hardcore, uh, matches.  Yeah.  Yep.  But I got a question about that as well.  Now, it's a hardcore match.  Anything goes, right?  Yep.  Why do you need the ref?  Oh, you really don't.  Except the final count of one, two, three is the only reason you need a ref.  Yeah, but he's looking in there, making sure everything's legal.  It's like, hey, ref, wait till they're ready to be counted.  Everything goes.  He's still got to make the ref moves, right?  Yeah, the ref has to, like, you know, be a, he has to be seen.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, you know, you know, what the hell?  And the other thing I want to mention really fast, the Jim Ross storyline. 
[00:43:30]  Yep.  Keep it going, man.  That's hysterical stuff.  Thank you.  That is really funny.  That's JR or something else.  But in real life, he really had a problem with his face, right?  Yeah.  He's had a couple of problems, you know, and, you know, it's a way to capitalize on, you know,  again, you always turn, you know, that negative into a positive.  That's what we do, no matter whether it's, you know, something that actually happens or  something that we make up or whatever.  You know, there's all kinds of lessons to be learned here and all kinds of fun to be had.  After all, that's what we're about is fun.  Right.  Cool. 
[00:44:00]  WrestleMania pay-per-view this Sunday.  There you go.  We're there.  And did I mention that we're on the CD list?  I think we're about six now, the top ten?  Yeah, the themes, the wrestler's theme show.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got a copy here in the studio.  Good.  I'd like to hear that no chance in hell on NAW.  No chance.  No chance.  I know that's right.  No chance.  Yeah.  And by the way, please don't change your format.  To what?  You know, you're talking about all talk, all that flow.  Yeah.  You know, they're talking about throwing you guys off the air.  That's not half that happened. 
[00:44:30]  No, we're not going anywhere.  If it goes polka, we're still here.  Yeah.  We still have to sit here.  That sounds great.  Take the heat.  And then Raw's War is Monday at the Meadowlands, I guess.  Monday at the Meadowlands.  Right on.  Vince McMahon, always a pleasure.  Opie, it's a pleasure.  And Anthony there?  Anthony.  Okay.  Thank you, Vince.  All right.  All right.  Vince McMahon, everyone.  Very cool.  All right.  A little conversation with Vinnie Mack, as he's called.  Yeah, we're huge wrestling fans.  We're pathetic. 
[00:45:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Black Crow's Only a Fool.  Welcome to the jungle.  Before that, it's Opie and Anthony.  And on the phone line, we got Stephen Lynch, our buddy.  Stephen.  Stephen?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  How's it going, man?  There you go.  Wait, why are you calling us?  Just to hang out.  You liar.  See how you guys are doing?  You're such a liar.  I didn't call, man.  Rick called me.  Come on. 
[00:45:30]  And I said, let me talk to those boys.  Honestly, why are you calling?  Because I'm sitting in this big-ass, plushy chair upstairs at Caroline's.  You remember that one?  Yeah.  That big, gigantic chair?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just want to tell you how comfy it was.  All right.  I'm lying.  I have a show tonight.  You ass.  At least you're honest.  You only call when you want to plug something.  That is so untrue, man.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  Last time you called, where were you?  I was at home in Michigan.  Yeah?  In your mom's house?  Yeah.  And you were plugging a gig back here in New York. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, but that was a charity event.  That was for the kids, man.  For the kids.  For the kids.  Let's remember the children.  For the handicapped kids.  I see.  Yeah.  Like, I don't make fun of them enough.  I figure I've got to do something for them.  You know what I mean?  You know, we do the same thing.  We feel a little better about ourselves when we put CDs on stuff.  We give some money to charity, and then we feel vindicated.  Like, yeah, see, we're good guys.  See, now we can make fun of those people we just sent charity money to.  It lasts for about a day and a half, and then you're an evil bastard again.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  You know how pathetic we are when we put out our Demand World CDs, Steven?  Uh-huh.  A couple charities said no to us.  Yeah.  That's how...  That's the type of reputation we had at the other station we worked at.  We're like, okay, look.  We're the number one show in Boston.  Everyone listens to us.  We're going to put out a CD that's going to sell easily 50,000 copies.  Yeah.  We want to give your charity about $100,000.  Right.  There were charities that said no.  No, go away.  I think you and Adolf Hitler would be the only people who charities would not accept money from. 
[00:47:00]  We got one letter from one organization that said, quite frankly, the disease is better than you two.  So they really didn't even want us for that.  It was horrible.  Do you remember what disease that was?  I don't know.  It was something awful, too, like gangrene of the testes or something.  We'd rather have our thingies fall off than take your dirty blood money.  That is depressing.  Yeah, it was. 
[00:47:30]  We got over it, though.  Honestly, it was a charity, Cancer for Kids.  Yeah, it was.  Was it really?  Oh, yeah.  It was a heavy charity.  They said no to us.  They didn't want our money.  They did not want to save a couple of kids' lives because it was coming from us.  That's pretty pathetic.  That is pretty pathetic.  Yeah, we finally signed on with Crack for Crack Whores.  So we supplied $100,000 for Crack to Crack Whores.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, well, we try to give it back. 
[00:48:00]  We try to give it back.  Give back a little bit.  You know, you've got to give back.  If you've been blessed, you give it back to the community.  What a show we're having today.  We had Vince McMahon on a little while ago.  You did?  Yeah.  Are you serious?  Are you a wrestling fan?  No, but I just watched that Bret the Hitman Hart special on A&E.  Yeah, you'd see him get popped.  And at the end, he punches him out.  Isn't that amazing?  It was awesome.  It was awesome.  He's not going to be there tomorrow or anything, is he? 
[00:48:30]  No.  Well, that was the next question we were going to ask him, and then he abruptly cut us off.  So that's all right, though.  We still had fun with him.  Yeah, he's a funny guy.  That is a heavy special on A&E where Bret Hart's in the dressing room, and then he looks  at the camera and he goes, guys, no, no, no, get out of here, because he knew  he was going to pop Vince McMahon.  Vince came out all...  Yeah, he comes out and he's staggering down the hall.  I can't stand up.  And then they interview...  God darn it, can we get Vince back on the phone?  Will he talk about this?  Call him up and ask him if he'll talk about the Bret Hart thing, because now we're on 
[00:49:00]  to something here.  Yeah, because then they interview Vince McMahon a little later, and he has a big, huge shiner.  Yeah, that was great.  If you ever see it on...  It was on A&E, right?  Yeah, I watched it twice.  It's so good.  It really is a great, great special.  It is.  Gives you a little inside look of what's going on.  Right, right.  Yeah, that was no Vince getting a stunner from Stone Cold.  That was a real pop in the eye.  That was it.  Because then they're talking to him later, and he's got the black eye.  So you're playing Caroline's, what, tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday? 
[00:49:30]  That's the ticket.  How are ticket salesmen?  They're good.  They're selling like hotcakes.  Very good.  Yeah, yeah.  So you might not be able to get him.  Call now.  Reserve your seats now, man.  And who do you want to thank for that?  I want to thank you.  Look at you.  Oh, you are sweet.  The two men, the most dearest and nearest to me.  The only guys...  And you guys, too.  I won't forget you guys.  The only guys in America that will play the pre-song for you.  That's right. 
[00:50:00]  You know, that song was banned from our show, and we've snuck it on four times so far.  Yeah, have you really?  For a banned song, we're playing it a lot.  That's awesome.  So we're going to be down there, what, Friday?  Tomorrow night.  Yeah, I think we're doing tomorrow night with you.  It's going to be a party, man.  We'll drop by for some beers.  Yeah, we've got the upstairs reserved for all three nights, too.  Oh, right on.  Oh, oh.  Well, you're going to kick it, man.  You have that kind of pull now with the people of Caroline's, where you reserve the upstairs? 
[00:50:30]  Well, they don't know we have it reserved, but...  Oh, we're sorry, Mr. De Niro.  I'm calling it.  Sorry, Mr. De Niro.  So Stephen Lynch has reserved the upstairs.  You have to go downstairs.  Well, you know...  Madonna.  No, Madonna.  Please leave.  Stephen Lynch has reserved the upstairs Madonna.  Well, she could stay.  You know, I've got to tell you, I think Rick is getting Vince McMahon back on the phone so  we can talk about Bret Hart.  Really?  Yeah, I'm serious.  I would like to...  Rick ran in and said one minute, like it might happen. 
[00:51:00]  No way.  So we'll conference you so you can listen in, all right?  Well, I've got to go sound check.  Oh.  Much too busy to participate in our little radio show.  All right.  I'm scared of Vince McMahon.  I don't want him to send his goonies down here to beat my ass.  Stephen Lynch!  I'm going to pull your sack off!  I might get the Iron Sheik or the Junkyard Dog or something like that.  Oh, wow.  You are old school.  You're old school wrestling.  Right.  King Kong Bundy might be crushing my ass. 
[00:51:30]  King Kong Bundy.  Remember him?  Isn't he dead?  What about Haystacks Calhoun?  Here's a name from the past.  I don't remember that guy.  The Iron Sheik?  I remember the Iron Sheik.  I remember that.  Yeah.  The whole...  That was when I was a kid, man.  Lou Albano.  All right.  Well, you're coming in tomorrow.  When?  He'll talk about it.  You want to hear this or not?  What?  We got Vince McMahon on the line again.  Is he on the line?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll go tune it in.  All right.  All right.  Listen, you're going to be in tomorrow, right?  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  I'll come in at like 4.30 or 5 or something like that.  And you're promising a couple brand new songs for the listeners.  Yeah.  I got a couple of you guys I've never heard before, so...  And you got to do the couple that we heard last time you were at Caroline's.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  If you guys are looking for something to do tonight, trust me.  Steven Lynch is a piss-er.  Thanks, man.  He's playing Caroline's tonight.  Ticket's going fast.  And we'll see you tomorrow in here, all right?  Excellent.  All right, brother.  All right, Steven.  All right, thanks, guys.  See you.  Steven Lynch.  Vince.  Yo.  All right, listen.  Our listeners think Ant and I are a bunch of pussies because we didn't ask you about 
[00:52:30]  Bret Hart.  Man, you guys can ask me about Ant and I.  It does not matter.  Of course, I probably won't answer, but that's all right.  Ask away.  All right.  Now, the A&E special on Bret Hart.  Right.  Which is pretty wild, by the way.  There's a scene where Bret Hart tells the camera guy to, you know, turn off the camera  because he's going to punch in the head.  Is that right?  That's what it looks like.  And then you came out of the room staggering.  Kind of staggering.  Yep.  And we wondered what happened in the room when the camera was off.  A lot of the listeners.  Well, actually, it was real easy what happened there. 
[00:53:00]  Bret didn't do things my way.  And as any good director working with talent, when you sign on, it's like, you know, you  do what you're supposed to do.  So, Bret didn't want to do what I asked him to do.  So, I made him do it anyhow.  So, that was a real tough call on my part.  So, at the same time, I felt like, you know, that I had screwed Bret to that extent that  it was a tough call on my part and I had to do what was best for everyone in the WWF that 
[00:53:30]  was remaining behind him as he went down to Turner's sinking ship.  So, therefore, I had to do something.  And the right thing to do was force Bret to do the right thing.  Wow.  But then, beyond that, being the bad guy that I am, it was like, you know what, I hung  around the arena waiting.  If Bret wanted a personal response from me, if Bret wanted, in essence, you know, to punch  me out, I was going to give him one shot. 
[00:54:00]  Because I felt like it was the thing to do.  Sure enough, Bret calls for me.  I go over there, you know, and I let Bret get one shot in.  Wow.  Bam, boom.  That's it.  Now, what happened, notwithstanding the one shot, what happens is, Goofy Briscoe, who's  one of the Stooges, in an effort to help me, as Bret's coming at me, which I was ready  for that.  Go ahead, Bret, let me have your best shot.  Briscoe steps on my ankle and breaks my ankle. 
[00:54:30]  What is wrong with that guy?  So, now, here I am coming out, you know, and I was trying to move around a bit there  so I didn't take that shot flush on the chin, you know.  Right.  So, now, it's like, you know, I get it in the temple, which was bad enough, you know,  and Briscoe steps right on my ankle and crushes my ankle.  So, now, I'm walking out of the locker room, I'm saying to myself, Vince, you're an idiot  for doing that.  Because now, it looked like you were staggering from the punch.  Yeah.  No, he throws a pretty good punch, by the way, but I was really, my ankle was broken, 
[00:55:00]  and I didn't know it for about five days.  I just kept walking on it, figuring it'd get better.  Now, they interviewed you after that, and you had a nice shiner, though.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  My goodness.  That's amazing.  So, yeah, have you spoken to the guy since?  Uh, no.  No, huh?  Well, now, he swears that you changed your mind and that he could keep his title or something  when he was wrestling in Canada, and you wanted to take it away from him or something like  that, right?  Yeah.  Well, see, the idea is I would do anything for our fans. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  Anything.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, and, you know, what Brett wanted to do was not conducive for our fans enjoying the  performance.  Right.  So, in essence, we did it my way anyhow, even though he didn't know we were going to do  it my way.  And I had balls enough to walk out there in front of him and in front of 15,000 people  standing there right there in front of Brett, and when it was done, I'm looking right at  him.  Of course, he, you know, throws a luger at me, which I might add is a hell of a shit. </pre>
