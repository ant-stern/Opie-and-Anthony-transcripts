<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  It began with a lurid anecdote about a news producer with a prosthetic arm, detailing her attempts at seduction and the hosts' subsequent discovery of her false limb, including graphic descriptions of upskirt photos and a naked bathtub encounter. This was followed by a heated discussion about an Ipswich, Massachusetts middle school's cancellation of its honors night, prompting debate about the merits of academic recognition and its impact on students.  Callers, including teachers and a construction worker (who digressed into the exorbitant cost of Carnegie Hall penthouses), contributed to the conversation.

The show then transitioned into speculation about the Pope's health, which spiraled into humorous conspiracy theories involving the Knights Templar and *The Da Vinci Code*. This led back to the theme of academic achievement, with a discussion about eliminating honor rolls and its societal implications, further fueled by a call from a school principal and the inclusion of a George Carlin bit. The hosts critiqued *Miami Vice*, particularly its portrayal of gangs, playing clips from the show and *MacGyver* to highlight their criticisms.  Colin Quinn's audacious attempt to rewrite *Crocodile Dundee 2* was discussed before his eventual call-in, recounting the experience.  The hosts also analyzed a viral photo of a man on the Burj Khalifa, and concluded this segment with a discussion about radio show preparation, promotional teases, jingles, and air checks, playing examples of each.  A Dollar Shave Club advertisement aired.


The next section started with a discussion about a SiriusXM internal "hot list" email and the upcoming Bon Jovi channel, prompting discussion about Bon Jovi's business acumen and the challenges faced by radio program directors. The conversation jumped between various SiriusXM channels, including Studio 54, Ultra Music Festival Radio, and classic rock channels. Music by Calvin Harris was played, and the hosts discussed *Spring Breakers*. Jay Leno's jokes about NBC, Eddie Money's health, and Kevin Federline's birthday were also mentioned, alongside the 50th anniversary of Alcatraz's closing (or relocation). Thin Lizzy's "Jailbreak" was played. The hosts then discussed Rick Dees' "Disco Duck" and the search for his follow-up ("Disco Rilla"), seguing into discussions of other radio personalities (Dan Ingram, Les Marshak, Cousin Brucie), copyright infringement, and working conditions in radio, including a humorous anecdote about a priest scandal and Troy's negativity towards Denny.  The segment ended with a discussion of novelty songs and a Dickie Goodman *Jaws* parody.

A segment focused on Dennis Falcone, his radio expertise, and his contrasting work ethic with the hosts'.  The changing landscape of radio and the use of automation were also touched upon.  Humorous anecdotes about Falcone were shared, including his aversion to door noises and whistling habit.  His upcoming "Worst of the Week" hosting gig was announced.  The hosts then launched into a hilarious critique of Rick Dees' musical career, playing and mocking "Disco Duck," "Disco Rilla," and "Bigfoot." An interview with comedian Ben Hoffman followed, discussing his Comedy Central show and his Twitter pranks involving Justin Bieber and George Clooney.  The death of Harry Reems was briefly mentioned, followed by a humorous story about Jon Hamm's penis requiring airbrushing.  The segment ended with a discussion of upcoming show elements.

Finally, the broadcast concluded with a segment dominated by the repetitive playing of a song titled "Eatin' Pussy, Kickin' Ass," described as Eric's theme song,  by staff member Roland.  The chaotic atmosphere of Roland and Eric's shared office was highlighted, with frequent call-ins and singalongs to the song. Roland's comedic characters were also mentioned. Alan Thicke Jr. participated in call screening and discussion.  A caller mentioned Ben's show and Rick Dees' "Eat My Shorts." Sam Roberts discussed his childhood appearance on *Figure It Out*, his use of human growth hormone, and his moving plans. A Dollar Shave Club advertisement aired, and the show ended with a mention of upcoming Sam Roberts appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio, Antonio, but enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Yeah, but that's it.  Oh, I need to do.  Can I get some aqua?  Bootle do.  Scooby do.  Cha cha roo.  Yo.  Be cool.  But.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  What are we on here?  Thursday?  Something like that.  Thursday.  Nice.  Nice.  It's the other Friday, I call it.  I was doing a lot of driving yesterday.  Oh, man.  Was that sex talk?  Yeah, I was doing a lot of fucking driving.  Make sure I close that, please.  Oh.  And.  Is this mine or yours, do you think?  I think they're both the same.  I was doing a lot of driving. 
[00:01:00]  And I related an old story to my wife.  Oh.  She knows most of the old stories.  Well, most of them have been told right here on our very airwaves.  Did we tell the story of the fake arm lady?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's been a while, though, right?  Slot machine, right?  Oh, that's right.  I forgot we called her slot machine.  Slot machine.  You told her that story?  Oh, yeah.  The whole thing.  The whole thing?  The bathroom?  Oh, yeah, where she was naked in the bathroom. 
[00:01:30]  That's great.  Oh, yeah, man.  Oh, boy.  But she was the one back a long time ago that we were on a rooftop somewhere.  She told me, you're not happy with your current relationship.  Wow.  But she was trying to make a power move.  Of course she was.  We were on the roof, and she's like, you're not happy with your current relationship.  It's very obvious to me, even though she only knew us, what, a few weeks?  Then she made the power move that same night where we went down to a party that was happening  in her apartment. 
[00:02:00]  And I think I told you a bunch of the guys were smoking pot and listening to Pink Floyd.  I mean, it's so hack.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pot and Floyd.  Whoa, watch out.  And then she starts calling me, and I'm like, where's this voice coming from?  And I go into the bathroom, and she's completely naked in the bathtub with just enough bubbles,  but not really.  You could see everything.  There's candles.  She goes to the power move.  You think she wanted some? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, I was taken.  Yeah.  And my reaction was to just openly laugh at her.  Just started laughing, because I'm like, this is ridiculous.  Did she have the fake arm on?  Well, that's what I was trying to remember yesterday when I was telling the story.  Or maybe the bubbles were hiding it.  I'm not sure if that was pre or post realizing she had a fake arm, which is key to the story.  Yeah.  Because she was coming and going back in the N.E.W. days. 
[00:03:00]  I don't even want to say who she worked for anymore.  Yeah, whatever.  But she was a producer for a pretty big news organization.  They were doing a piece on us, so she was coming and going.  And remember, she started hanging out with us.  Yeah, yeah.  The office parties, we would have.  Oh, boy.  We would drink beers after the show in our office, because none of us really wanted to go home.  And maybe we'd hit a few local restaurants and bars.  The whole group was hanging.  She was part of the gang.  She was part of the gang for a while.  And the big reveal, we were at Hooters on 56th Street below the N.E.W. studios for that big signing. 
[00:03:30]  Remember the huge signing when, I don't know, three or four magazines on us came out at the same time?  It was like, it was a crazy time when people gave a shit about magazines.  So we did a magazine signing, and she was there filming it for this piece.  Most people know, but for the new listeners, I'll fucking let her be.  And all of a sudden, I'm sitting there behind the table signing with you, and I look up, and I notice she has a fake arm. 
[00:04:00]  She put a hello bracelet on it, remember?  Yeah, she used to have a bracelet on it, and it freaked me the fuck out, because I'm thinking to myself, we've been hanging with this girl for, I don't know, at least a month.  And no one, not one of us in the organization, knew that she had a fake arm.  Nope.  So then I remember, I told this whole story yesterday.  I kind of nudged you, and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.  And I went like this, like, you know, bringing the left-hander.  I was, like, doing this, and kind of moving my eyes toward her, and then you saw it, and then you freaked the fuck out. 
[00:04:30]  I couldn't believe it.  We never noticed.  And then we all started kind of, like, you know, talking among ourselves, and one by one, everyone's freaking out, because now one person knew she had a fake arm that whole time.  And she would be hanging in our office and drinking.  Oh, yeah.  Holy.  And she was definitely, you know, pretty cute and stuff.  It's doable.  I remember the tampon string picture.  I told that story, too. 
[00:05:00]  She took an upskirt shot.  Upskirt, underneath the desk.  She took my camera.  I think back then we were just taking disposable cameras for gigs and stuff, because I don't think digital cameras were, you know.  Not very good.  Nah, they were out there, but, you know, not really happening yet.  So she took my digital camera and did an upskirt, but forgot that she was, you know, on the rag.  And remember the picture with the string?  No, I remember her.  I remember that.  It was under the desk.  She was sitting at your desk.  I guess you had left already. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And we were still hanging out drinking and stuff in the office.  Yeah, she wanted to give me a little surprise.  And she wanted to leave a little surprise on Opie's camera.  So she grabbed the camera on the desk and just clicked an upskirt under his desk.  And there was a string hanging out.  That had led to her naked in the bathtub.  Naked in the bathtub.  You know, and I guess in a way I was trying to be a good guy, even though I definitely wasn't that happy.  You know, sometimes I go, you know what?  You probably should have jumped in the fucking bathtub.  Should have done it.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Did she have a fleshlight attachment for the arm for a handjob?  Yeah.  She's like Michael Rooker in the fucking Walking Dead.  Yeah.  With the fucking weapon on there.  She was all right, man.  She was all right.  She definitely had a nice body on her.  Wouldn't she always hold her one hand over it?  She was.  She knew how to hide it.  Because, I mean, we're in a studio.  It's afternoon drive.  It's a lot of sunshine and light.  Oh, yeah.  Not one of us knew that whole time.  And then the big reveal at Hooters. 
[00:06:30]  I think she kind of let her guard down.  Yeah, she did.  She wasn't covering it up.  So you couldn't tell in the bathtub because of the bubbles?  See, that's what I don't remember.  Did she have the arm underwater, maybe?  No, I don't remember.  That's what I was saying yesterday when I was telling the story.  I don't remember.  I think it was a below the elbow.  Oh, no.  She was missing a lot of her arm.  Was it like mid?  Not all the way up.  You know what?  I don't even know that anymore.  Because I was under the impression because she was able to bend her arm pretty well.  So I was under the impression it was a below the elbow. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  Because the elbow joint was still there.  You sure?  That made it so much harder for us to notice because she was able to move her arm.  Yeah, I don't know.  She wasn't just mannequin-ing around.  Yeah, mannequin-ing.  Mannequin-ing.  Yeah, I love the mannequin-ing.  I don't remember if we knew about the fake arm pre or post naked in the bathtub.  That's what I was trying to remember.  Because it would have been even funnier if I didn't notice the fake arm in the bathtub.  Oh, man.  But I'm not sure.  So I can't. 
[00:07:30]  I don't know.  So how did the bathtub thing end?  Did you just walk out?  I started.  Did you jump in and have Fred Norris behind you?  I openly started laughing because how ridiculous it was.  Yeah.  I mean, a mere five, six feet away in the living room, you know, this pot party was going on.  And I'm just like, what the fuck?  We're on the roof drinking a little bit.  You could have pulled a, what are we going to do about this? 
[00:08:00]  I probably.  I probably.  Unzipped.  I probably should have, like, just said, fuck, fuck it and started there.  I probably would have been, you know, better off at the time.  Get a nice stump up your ass.  Fucking diddles your ass with her stump.  And then I remember going, I got to get out of here.  Because I was just openly laughing at the ridiculousness.  Yeah.  I remember I'm pretty much at the front door of the apartment.  And she appears at the top of the stairs in a bathrobe.  And she's motherfuckering me. 
[00:08:30]  What's that?  Well, because women don't want to be laughed at if you see them naked.  You fucking.  How dare you?  Especially when they have one arm.  Right.  Wow.  How dare you get back here, all that shit.  Holy shit.  I'm just like, I got to go.  You probably could have gotten a good angry fuck out of her at that point.  You were still in.  I was trying to be a good guy, you know.  Maybe I.  Good guy, schmood guy with the fucking relationships we had.  Maybe I regret it a little bit now.  But the laughing, I'll never forget. 
[00:09:00]  And then she took that very personally.  Oh, yeah.  Very personally.  She's taking it very personally.  You can't laugh at naked girls.  Anyway.  That came up yesterday.  I was driving back and forth from way out east.  Oh.  Checking out a.  I'm trying to get a summer house.  A prospective summer house?  Yeah.  I'm trying, but I just can't justify the amount of money they want for these places. 
[00:09:30]  That's how it is out there.  Over 100 G's for the whole summer.  And I'm not talking anything spectacular.  I literally just made the home alone face without irony.  Wow.  I wanted this one house.  It was in a neighborhood.  You'd have to drive to the beach, sort of a private beach, at least a mile, mile and a half.  The town you would have to drive to.  So it's just a neighborhood house.  It's like when you get a summer house, you're hoping maybe it's walking distance to the beach or walking distance to town, something like that. 
[00:10:00]  And a really nice house, huge backyard, huge pool.  The guy wanted $110,000 for the summer.  Holy fuck.  So I told the girl that's been, you know, bringing me around, I go, look, if the guy wants to come down, we'll talk.  But that's crazy.  And then the guy, all cocky and shit, gets back to her and goes, not only am I not coming down, I expect to get more than that even.  I'm dealing with, like, pompous assholes out there.  Yeah, fucking, why would you want to deal with them all summer?  Well, then, you know, I went back out there yesterday and I was just asking about that house. 
[00:10:30]  So what's going on with that?  Because that was the last of her, the guy who gave that speech.  Oh, it's rented.  He got $135,000 for it.  So what was he going to do?  It went up $25,000.  He was going to jack you if you took it?  If I, well, I don't know.  I don't think I could pull the trigger or something like that.  That's crazy.  No, but I mean, if you had, he would have just raised it on you?  Yeah, it probably would have been outbid by somebody, yeah.  Yeah, it's like a bidding war and all that shit for these houses.  So people out there, like, if you have Spielberg and McCartney, $135,000 is literally, like, spending, for us, $1,000. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, they just throw that away.  You just realize how, you just realize that people have just so much fucking money, man.  I mean, we're doing, we're doing pretty well now.  But there are some of those fucking people, like, yeah, like Spielberg, you know.  You realize it's nothing compared to what, you know, people are making out there.  Yeah, when they go out to the Hamptons, they don't think about, you know, 110, 100, they're like, yeah.  Right.  A million. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Sure.  Why not?  And then we looked at just a shitty house.  It was, like, two bedrooms, like an old farmhouse picture, okay?  Worn, man, because of the weather.  Worn.  But, you know, the upkeep kind of nice.  Big, huge windows that overlook the bay and marshland.  The view was really, really nice.  But the water and the marshland, you can't do anything with it.  You just look at it.  You can't go in it for a quick swim, nothing.  And they have a little deck and tiny little yard, and, you know, I want to maybe buy a  summer house eventually. 
[00:12:00]  So I'm also asking, how much are these houses going for, you know?  The rental on this thing was $100,000, and it was nothing.  Jesus.  And then I go, what do they want for that, you know, the house?  I see it's on the market.  $4.5 million.  Whoa.  For two bedrooms, old wood floors, doesn't have anything comfortable in it whatsoever where  you feel like you're just chilling out.  Location, location, location.  Yeah, I guess.  That's what it's all about.  It's all about this view, but I'm like, the view, yeah, that's really nice, but you can't 
[00:12:30]  do anything with it.  I'll put a painting on the wall.  You have a nice view in your apartment.  Fuck view.  Get a nice hotel suite and a Ritz somewhere.  You can do that fucking for a lot less than that for the summer.  It's kind of discouraging, but I don't know.  I think I want to, like, move, like, go check out the Jersey Shore next week instead.  There you go.  With the real people.  The regular deals.  Get in a house that's...  Paint her coffee.  Get in a house that's a bit tilted still from the hurricane.  I don't care.  100,000 to do it.  Go out there and have your coffee in the morning? 
[00:13:00]  What the hell's wrong with you?  Guy, you spent a couple hundred bucks.  You're a lax.  What the hell do I know?  What the hell do I know?  Yeah.  Take the kid to the beach.  Yeah.  What's he getting no different between that sand and that sand?  That sand.  Get ahead and enjoy.  I'm going to go over there and have a palm oil.  Stupid regular dough.  Very discouraging.  Wow.  It really is.  My word.  It really is.  That's a lot of fucking money, dude.  That's a lot.  Oh, yeah.  For a summer.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  For a year.  That's a lot of money.  Yeah.  It's a lot of money.  Yeah.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  For three months.  And that doesn't count, like, your expenses going back and forth and everything else you're  going to do.  That's just to fucking have the place.  Now you've got to buy food, transportation, fucking whatever you're going to do out there.  Yeah.  It costs you some money.  That would be expensive, even if it included a lot of other shit.  I bet the fucking restaurants out there are a little expensive to eat in.  I wouldn't doubt it. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  It's nice out there.  I like it.  I like going there.  I go there every summer for, you know, a weekend here, a weekend there.  How much is that a week?  If you go, what's it, eight weeks?  For the summer, they consider the summer eight weeks or about ten weeks?  Eight to ten weeks.  Yeah, sure.  So if you get ten weeks, that's $10,000 a week.  $10,000 a week, you're just going here, here.  And then, you know, because we can't take the whole summer off, so it's going to be going  out there on the weekends.  So now you're only getting it for the weekends.  Right.  Oh, boy. 
[00:14:30]  So I'm like, how do you justify that?  But like you guys said, there's people that have, like, real money where they laugh at  that, like, oh, yeah, here, here.  Yeah.  We don't even know if we're going to be here, but yeah, if we are, we want to be in this  house.  In the Time Warner building, when you look, there's, like, those $40 million apartments.  A lot of them are people who live there a very short amount of time.  Part-time.  Yeah.  That's like a place they come to in New York, and they have $40 million.  It's crazy.  I have finally in my life, I've been able to afford myself a nice spot in Manhattan, right?  And same with our buildings. 
[00:15:00]  When May, when Memorial Day hits, half my building clears out.  Yeah.  Because it's their, they have another house somewhere else.  It's unbelievable the amount of money these people in New York City have.  Yeah.  It's all relative.  Like, I think I'm doing well, and then I'm like, I wanted to upgrade to a bigger one.  I'm like, ah, I had to really think about it.  And I'm like, just get some new furniture and shut the fuck up.  Really?  Yeah.  Don't be a dick.  Don't be a fucking dick and go back into debt.  But it must be nice to do that, I mean, and not care. 
[00:15:30]  To be able to go out and get a fucking, like, that place on, they're building on 57th Street.  Yeah.  That, that, the crank house.  That giant house, uh, giant, uh, yeah, building.  Yeah, it's like 90 stories or something.  It's going to be one of the tallest buildings in New York when it's done.  Yeah.  It's going to be, uh, top, I want to say top five.  Highest residence.  Yeah.  But I forget how much they're going for in that.  It's right by Carnegie Hall.  It's like across the street.  Yeah.  It's by our old XM.  Yeah.  But there's no neighborhood there.  No.  That's.  Which is amazing to me.  You get out and you're in fucking Midtown.  Yeah.  You get out and you're in the middle of nothing, like. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Things will open up though, I bet.  I guess.  Little things around there.  But there's the delis and you're, you're so close to fucking.  I'm a guy that needs to kind of wander around though and feel like kind of neighborhood.  That's why I like the West Village.  I like the Upper West Side.  Yeah.  I like who we are.  There's a few other places that are like that as well.  You leave your apartment and you feel like you're in kind of a neighborhood.  I like that feel.  And I'm a little bit country.  I'm out there on Long Island.  You're a little bit rock and roll.  I used to love that part of the song.  Did you?  Yeah.  I like Donny Osmond a lot. 
[00:16:30]  I'm a little bit country.  I'm a little bit rock and roll.  Oh, and they would sing about how they're country and rock and roll.  I don't know if I'm good or bad, but I know I love it.  So is that how it works?  Something like that.  And then we're driving back into the city and it was around the time we used to drive  out of the city after our afternoon drive show.  And I looked at my wife and go, see that?  We were stuck in that every fucking night.  That's what led me to saying, fuck Long Island.  I got to make my commute way better and camp out in the city. 
[00:17:00]  That commute, it's never gotten better.  We haven't done that commute in over 10 years.  And it's the exact same commute.  And that's the shit.  I know I obsess about it on this show.  That's the shit Mayor Bloomberg should be trying to figure out.  Because it's at least 10, 12 years later and it's the exact same commute.  And guess what time it was?  It was 8.30 a night when you think the fucking commute would calm down.  It's still a fucking mess.  It was still bumper to bumper.  The only times the commute isn't really that bad is, thank God, during the hours I commute. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  It's early in the morning.  It's not bad.  And then even going home after 10 o'clock here, it's not that bad.  Yeah, you're in between, you know, you got those tiny little windows where you get in and out.  I've left at 2 p.m.  And already it's starting to fucking get crazy.  Yeah, no.  That's why when he goes after the dumb big sodas and hiding the cigarettes and the salt content,  I'm like, how about you tackle the commuting problem? 
[00:18:00]  How about you try to figure out that one?  Because that one, I'll say it again, and I've read articles, that shit causes a lot of heart attacks.  You should just stack up fucking highways, like 20 lanes high, and we're driving like that.  Imagine that.  We need another Robert Moses to figure some shit out.  I don't know what the fuck the solution is.  You got a stupid island with only a few highways on it.  It's not our place to figure it out.  Yeah.  But you got a mayor who wants to make the city, you know, better.  There you go. 
[00:18:30]  That would be a massive improvement for many people's lives.  And it's not easy, obviously.  I don't even know what the solution is.  Incredibly complicated.  But why deal with that when you can, like, you know, make believe you're doing something by taking people's big sodas away?  Their mass transit stinks, so it's not like you could even do that to get more cars off the road.  So, I don't know.  That is a tough fucking nut right there.  It's literally like trying to go into a fucking, from a big room into a ketchup bottle.  There's absolutely no good way to fucking get that neck. 
[00:19:00]  And we got a...  It's terrible.  Yeah, we got a system here in and around New York.  One lousy car breaks down, the whole fucking thing gets fucked up.  One person has to have a bad car, and you're fucked.  And they're assholes, too, like drivers.  They're real fucking stupid.  If you're on a highway, obviously, before there's traffic, before something breaks down, if you're the car that breaks down, you kind of know something's happening unless your wheels fall off.  Right.  But they can never get over to the fucking side while they still have kinetic energy in their vehicle to fucking move over to the side of the road. 
[00:19:30]  So, it's like, car is dying.  And they just stay in the left lane until it goes...  Right.  Right.  And now the whole fucking highway's blocked.  I have to get over, guy.  Get over!  I'd be so embarrassed if I was asshole guy in the middle lane, broken down.  And then a fender bender with two cars, like, bumped together.  They think that they've got to stay exactly where they were, or it's like leaving the scene of an accident instead of getting completely off the fucking road. 
[00:20:00]  They just stop their vehicles, block two lanes, and then you've got miles of backed up traffic.  Miles.  They ought to fucking really find the shit out of people that do that.  Brian Regan, even though it's a goofy fucking bit, it makes perfect sense.  The big magnets?  The big magnets.  I bet you could figure out that technology.  Oh, it would be great.  You'd grab that asshole's car and get it out of the way immediately. 
[00:20:30]  How great would that be?  A helicopter with a big magnet.  It just comes, grabs your car, and dumps it off the side of the road.  Helicopter with a magnet.  How great would that be?  Yeah, they just patrol all the time.  Love it.  There you go, Bloomberg.  We got one for you.  Tackle that one.  Going back to Jimmy.  Tony in Brooklyn, who's one of the construction guys at that Carnegie 57.  Let's make him a star today.  What the hell?  He's got a fucking lunch pail in his hand.  Give him some air time.  Tony, go ahead.  Tell Jimmy what you know.  Hey, I'm working on that building.  I'm a project manager at commercial construction. 
[00:21:00]  That building is going for the penthouses, $110 million.  $10,000 a square foot for the penthouses in that building.  I tell you, you spend that kind of money, you're going to have a square head.  You know what I'm saying, Tony.  Good luck.  Be safe on the job site.  What the hell do I know?  $110 million.  And that'll be a part-time home for somebody.  Yeah.  Someone will just be like, whatever.  And it'll be a home for somebody that doesn't work.  Yeah.  Those type of people don't work ever. 
[00:21:30]  They don't work anymore.  Guys like Zuckerberg and Gates, guys like that with that kind of money, they're just nice  guys who marry their sweethearts.  Right.  They're not pigs.  Like, Bill Gates never fucking took a picture of his dick and sent it to anybody.  No.  Zuckerberg doesn't do that.  It's because their brain's wired differently.  It's wired differently.  Yeah.  Hey, Tony.  Yo.  Can you get me up there for a little peek?  What do you think?  Yeah.  A hundred percent, dude.  No problem.  I can get you up there.  For a peek?  Yeah.  You're kidding, right?  All right.  Hold on, man.  I can get you up there. 
[00:22:00]  I'll bring you in as a whatever.  No problem.  I got a car to get in, and then I can bring you up there.  No problem.  I would love to see up there.  How high can we go?  Can we go higher than the crane?  I can get you up to like 85.  I got some tremendous pictures from the last week, as a matter of fact.  Jimmy, you want to go?  Yeah.  But is it one of those?  Let me ask you, Tony.  Is it one of those out?  Those always scare me, the construction.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Is the wall?  I want to go on one of the floors where the wall is not complete.  I know, Jimmy.  I know what you're saying.  I'm sorry.  The construction elevators scare me. 
[00:22:30]  Fuck.  I'll do it, man.  Tony, can we do this?  Yeah, we can do this.  I'll tell you what.  I have one follower on Twitter.  It's you.  I follow you?  No, no, no.  I mean, I only use Twitter only for you, and I've sent you a few things, but, you know,  whatever.  Well, I'll give you the big Twitter plug after we do this, because fucking everyone's going  to be attacking you.  Hold on a line.  I want to get your number.  I really want to get a peek.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Tony.  It's like Nakatomi Plaza. 
[00:23:00]  You'd be up there in the fucking construction.  I think he's legit.  Fuck.  You want to go, Jimmy?  Yeah, but those outdoor elevators, the construction ones, I don't know.  These guys are fucking maniacs.  They're like, all right, you put some girders up, throw an elevator on it.  I know.  It's fucking horrifying.  You don't like them.  No, I certainly don't like them.  No, I certainly don't like them.  No, I certainly don't like them.  Strapped to the side of the building.  No.  It just seems like one good wind, and you can hear, and the whole thing's going to tip  down, it just comes right down.  It wouldn't make me happy, but I could go.  Dude, I would be fucking huddled in the front, staring into the building like a cage. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, really?  I would be, you know when they put a cage on someone's stomach, and they light one end  of it to make the rat shoot through your stomach?  That's how close I'd be to the front of the building.  My asshole was on fire.  I think they have elevators, though, inside.  Do they?  Yeah, I think they already have them going.  Oh, yeah, probably.  That building's almost done.  Yeah, it's almost done.  I think you're just kind of fooling around with the top of it.  I don't think it's the construction elevator anymore.  Oh, no?  No, I don't think so.  Yeah, but I want to go on an open floor.  Do you remember when we used to go on the roof of our old building? 
[00:24:00]  That was before 9-11.  We would be bored, and we were in the building right above the Brooklyn Diner for the people  that give a shit on 57th and 7th.  That's where we broadcasted at NEW, which is now just offices.  There's no radio in there anymore.  Where's 1010?  I don't know.  Where the fuck?  They dumped them all downtown.  Downtown or something.  Where it was cheaper.  And we would be bored, and all of a sudden just jump in the elevator, and you could just  go on the roof of buildings in New York City like it was nothing.  Fucking hang out up there drinking beers. 
[00:24:30]  And that was like, I think that's almost 60 stories.  That was way the fuck up there.  Yeah, you could overlook Times Square from there.  It was pretty cool.  Yeah.  What scares me about being on one of those is there was a guy blown off the roof.  It was downtown.  It was around where Ground Zero is.  It was the 45th or 50th floor or something.  Right.  And they have those big orange things that kind of come out like nets.  Right.  And that is to protect people from being blown off.  And some guy got blown off over that.  I'm still, and I swear I'm not promoting, I'm just saying, I'm still having anxiety attacks 
[00:25:00]  about that fucking eagle.  Did you get my tweet?  I had nightmares about that.  I meant to retweet you.  I had fucking, I had them again yesterday.  I'm having these incredible anxiety attacks.  I play over and over again in my brain, Moses, you know, walking out on that eagle.  And I, in my head, I see him fucking falling over and over again.  And last night before I was going to bed, because I was tired from a long day of driving  and shit, another anxiety attack.  I never had anxiety attacks before I went up to that, that old observation deck at the 
[00:25:30]  Chrysler building.  I saw a little thing yesterday, somebody had tweeted something about how Department of  Homeland Security is calling urban explorers terrorists.  Urban explorers are terrorists because they are exposing the vulnerabilities of the various  cities and whatnot.  So they're showing the fucking government that they're not doing their job and they're terrorists?  They say they're terrorists.  I don't know nothing.  I don't know nothing.  Would you go on that eagle with socks? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, God.  It's like brand new white socks.  Yes.  Like, I can't explain it, but also my body gets like a quick, like I'm cold or something,  like a quick little, ah.  Yeah.  Over and over again it's happening.  Because I know how windy it was that day when he did it.  And he downplays everything like, oh, no, not really.  That's just a camera picking up the wind.  I'm like, I was up there.  It was windy.  It was a windy day.  So slippery.  So.  My goodness. 
[00:26:30]  What?  That's, yeah, that's pretty creepy.  I don't know.  I was looking at what Sam is exploring here.  Twitter turns seven.  Releases greatest hits video.  Really?  I guess Twitter's seven.  And they're showing kind of things that stand out over the years.  I do remember, and I've said it before, the first thing I even heard of Twitter was that  some guy was in a plane crash, and he tweeted, holy shit, I was just in a plane crash.  And it wasn't the one in the Hudson. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, it wasn't?  No, it was some other one.  Yeah.  It was in the 50s, right?  Yeah, it was in the 50s.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  The big bopper.  Hello, baby.  Hashtag dead, baby.  It's pretty cool, though.  They just had, like, first tweet from space.  This video's all right, man.  You can tweet from space.  That guy, that astronaut that has the account is fucking amazing.  I should follow him.  Oh, the Japanese dude that takes all the good pictures? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, maybe.  I don't know what he is.  But he's always these fucking amazing photos of Earth.  That's hilarious.  He's a Japanese guy.  You just fucking retweet him.  Put yawn.  Z.  I'm sure he's got the same assholes.  I'm sure he has.  Enough of the pictures from space.  Yeah, I'm sure he has.  Clouds, we get it.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  You used to be way better before you started taking pictures from space.  From space.  You've lost touch with your audience. 
[00:28:00]  I gotta see this video.  It's cool.  Yeah.  I want to retweet that one.  Twitterage.  Now it's just fucking affected so many people's lives.  People have been fired.  Oh, man.  Fucking killed.  Boy, does Keith Robinson have a funny bit on that.  Yeah?  About how you can only lose an important job about Twitter.  I'm not going to do his joke, but he has a fucking, very easy idea.  That's pretty good.  He's got a funny fucking observation.  He's got the joke.  Yeah, it's great.  I gotta check it out.  I gotta find out during the break.  Well, another thing we're passionate about, we bitch about this stupid mayor in New York City 
[00:28:30]  because he's just a joke because he doesn't tackle, you know, the important issues affecting New Yorkers.  Take on Pfizer.  We've got a major pill problem in this fucking city, in this fucking country.  Why don't you try to take that one on, Mayor Bloomberg?  Fuck.  We have another school that is canceling an event because some kids might feel not worthy. 
[00:29:00]  This is so fucking lame.  I read this last night.  A bunch of parents who don't want to do their jobs as parents co-sign this.  Yeah.  They'll tell their kids that it's okay if you're not perfect.  But all this shit, I don't remember being bothered by any of this when I was in school.  No, no, no.  Because we're going to talk about, like, an honors night.  I remember honors night.  I don't.  Me neither.  I don't think I was.  I never went.  Until I got to Hilton and joined their club.  Yeah, there you go.  Zing.  So there's a school that's canceling honors night because it could be hurtful to students. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Do most students care, even?  I don't think so.  I remember when I was going through high school and stuff, you had kids that were definitely way smarter than me  and they had their honors nights and stuff, and I didn't care.  I went and did something else.  Smoke some pot with your friends.  Or whatever it was.  Go to the hole in the fence.  Yeah.  If you knew a place called the hole in the fence when you were in school, you didn't go to the honors.  No.  Try to go to a place called the hole in the bathroom stall.  That really wrecks things. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, it's fucking, it's really, I wasn't in the honors, dude.  I wasn't a member of any of that shit.  There's so many other things you can do.  How about you stop stressing that only college works?  How about you stop stressing that only this dumb system, it's good to do well in school, but you can do other shit.  The world needs ditch diggers, too.  Yeah.  Yes.  What is really fucked up about this, because the more and more I talk to other parents, the parents don't want any of this shit.  Yeah.  That's what I'm learning.  It's a very small percentage of parents that can't do their job or feel incredibly bad for their children, so they cause the stink. 
[00:30:30]  It's fucking amazing that achievement can't be recognized anymore in any way, shape, or form.  In America.  We're built on that shit.  If you achieve a level that is above the norm, you can't recognize it, you can't let the person feel good about it, because there are people that haven't achieved that.  When will we learn as a society here that there are people that are smarter than other people, and there are people that are stronger than other people, there are people that are more artistic, creative, musically, whatever it is, and we're different in that way. 
[00:31:00]  So you can recognize that.  There are fucking smarter kids in school than other kids.  Right.  And no matter how you teach one group, there's another group that will just do better.  It's just the way it fucking is.  So why can't you acknowledge those people and show them, like, wow, you've really done well. 
[00:31:30]  And, you know, the whole thing about growing up, you try a whole bunch of different things until you find what you're good at.  Find your niche.  But if you've got schools and teachers basically saying it doesn't matter that you're not good at this sport or this instrument or you're not that good in this class, it doesn't matter.  Everyone is the same.  We're not the same.  We're never going to be the same.  Not the same.  So why fucking try to squash the people that have achieved things because you think someone might feel bad that they're not included? 
[00:32:00]  Shut up.  I was obsessed with basketball growing up, and I, you know, I took it very seriously.  And there were times driving home with my dad, I was extremely upset because I either had a shitty game or we lost or whatever it was.  Oh.  And he would give me pep talks like, look, you get back in that fucking driveway, you practice your free throws, whatever the fuck it was.  Win one for the gipper.  Yeah, but, you know, all kidding aside, he taught me the lesson that you just work harder at it. 
[00:32:30]  And at times he also told me about things like, you know what, maybe that's not your thing.  Maybe you're not good at whatever it was at the time, and maybe you should try this instead.  Did you go up in a tree then?  He wasn't good with the sex talk, that's for sure.  Were you hurt when you overheard him on the phone after one of those talks, John?  My kid's a faggot.  I can't play ball.  I hate him.  Do you know, it's like, I wonder if the superintendent, who's pushing for this or whoever it is.  Right.  I wonder if they would give up their job because teachers who couldn't get their job feel bad. 
[00:33:00]  It's fucking, you know, it's like, no, of course not.  You got where you wanted to go.  Oh, it's almost impossible to get rid of shitty teachers.  No, but you know what I mean?  It's almost impossible.  Like, whoever's pushing for this, I wonder if they would give up some of their pay so  someone below their pay grade gets the same amount they do so they don't feel like fucking  nonsense.  And here come the teachers.  We got Rob in New York.  Rob, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I want to let you know that you guys are kind of taking it out of proportion.  Most schools that I know, and certainly schools that I teach in, they celebrate kids that 
[00:33:30]  achieve in all different forms, you know, whether it's sports, art, academics.  You know, they have honor societies, award ceremonies, and a lot of my friends are teachers,  and they do the same thing.  So the only reason this is news is because this is kind of a rarity.  I don't know if it's a trend.  Hopefully it's not.  But generally speaking, I think kids today appreciate the fact that they're not going to be the smartest,  most athletic, and they're going to excel.  And it's okay to celebrate that.  You know what part of it is, too?  It's like, I believe in these school shootings, because anything that makes some students feel 
[00:34:00]  or look better, by default, others will look worse and feel worse.  So they're doing everything they can to try to weed out any motivation that makes someone  feel bad.  Rob, I don't think we're blown out of proportion.  I mean, we're hearing this more and more of these type of stories, where they're canceling,  you know, Halloween or Valentine's Day, or in this case, the honors night.  So I think you're right, and I think Jimmy, you know, does have a point that, but I think  it's how schools want to handle this. 
[00:34:30]  I mean, you don't want kids to feel disenfranchised and feel like they're not part of anything  and kind of drift in an isolated way.  So schools don't have to deal with it in a healthy way.  The counselors contacting teachers and finding out this kid, you know, how is he behaving?  How is he looking?  Instead of crushing it for everyone, they address the one or two kids who kind of appear on the  fringe and they keep their eye on them.  I don't know how a healthy school does it.  But yeah, maybe you're right.  Maybe the trend is going the wrong way, but I don't, in my personal experience, I don't  see it. 
[00:35:00]  My dad ran a basketball league when I was growing up for Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, the old church  out there in Centiport.  Huh?  Bloomberg.  Our Lady Queen of Martyrs.  And he had an awards night every year.  And this is what he did, and I never forgot it.  He gave everybody something.  Everybody.  And back then, buttons were big.  So he would take everyone's picture and he would make a little button with the year and, 
[00:35:30]  you know, whatever.  And then he had other stuff he would give away.  But then he gave away awards for, like, the best team.  There was MVPs.  There was, like, he had all sorts of, like...  The real ones.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you know what?  Right.  In the end, everyone walked away extremely happy.  You had the kids that, you know, won the big awards and they were happy.  But then the kid with his dumb little button was like, wow, look, you know, I was recognized  tonight.  And it was a huge success.  So there is ways to do it. 
[00:36:00]  We could honor people for being the best at something, but you also honor the kids for  at least just being in the game or whatever.  Yeah, and I do see that happening.  But, you know, this school crushing any type of acknowledgement of academic success is  ridiculous.  It's sickening.  You want to push kids forward, that's certainly not the way to do it.  And we bring it back to the rest of the world.  Do you think the rest of the world is doing this?  We're going to get our asses kicked.  No.  Eventually, we're going to get our asses kicked if this is how we're raising the next generation. 
[00:36:30]  The other day, I was actually teaching about totalitarianism and how education was handled  in the totalitarian society.  And one of the students was from China, and, you know, she just came this year.  And she was saying in their school system, and I'm not saying this is a better school system  at all, but in their school system, you're expected to stand up and help out your answer  and know exactly what's going on, or there's so much pressure and ridicule on them.  Again, I don't think that's healthy for the kids, but if you want to talk about pushing 
[00:37:00]  achievement, that's pretty intense.  Right.  Hold on a minute.  It's in Massachusetts.  Hold on.  Bill in Atlanta wants in on this.  Oh, Bill.  Another teacher.  Bill, go ahead.  You're on with Rob in New York.  Hey, guys, I don't want to be too harsh on Rob here, but, you know, I kind of heard  Ant a little bit when he talked about you don't want to disenfranchise that kid, and  that's exactly what we're talking about.  Some kids are going to be disenfranchised because they just don't fit into a certain 
[00:37:30]  mold or into a certain group.  And it's not the teachers and the school's responsibility to make sure that kid's okay.  That's where the parenting comes into play.  That's not the role of the school to make sure that the kid feels okay about an honor  society.  We're trying to bring everyone down to the lowest level of achievement.  Like, bring all the overachievers and people that are above average down to the lowest point 
[00:38:00]  without acknowledging their greatness because it might make the people feel bad.  No, we're raising some people and lowering other people and trying to have them meet  in mediocrity.  Yeah, of course.  In milquetoast land.  Because that's the safest place to be, I guess.  Or so they think.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but I know what you were just saying.  Thank you.  I think you might be misunderstanding what I was saying because I'm not saying that, you  know, it's the job of the school to make everybody feel mediocre or everybody to feel that they 
[00:38:30]  fit in.  Did say that.  It is the job of the school to provide a social kind of safety net.  Social safety net.  I think it is the job of the school to provide a net for kids that might put the cracks and  might wind up causing difficulty traction.  And most kids want to just socialize anyway.  Yeah.  They're like, ah, I'm not going to honors night.  All right.  Whatever.  Let's go do something else. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I've got to let you know.  High school was never.  All right, man.  Thank you.  High school for me was never about really learning what they were teaching.  It was more just learning about how to function in a little society.  In a little, you know, microcosm.  So you'd go to school.  You'd see your friends.  You'd see people that you liked, people you didn't like, people that were smarter than  you, people that were dumber than you.  Like you just, it was your first foray into real life out of your house.  Right.  And I think that's more important in school than fucking learning, you know, social studies 
[00:39:30]  or something.  Learning some of this nonsense.  Because that shit you could just learn on your own.  That's exactly what I did.  I just learned that shit on my own because I had a natural curiosity for certain things.  But the community thing, that was where you kind of learned that, holy shit, I'm not the  great kid my parents told me I was.  I don't even understand how you teach a kid nowadays because everything is at your fingertips. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Every kid now has a phone with Google.  So why the fuck?  How do kids do homework?  I don't know, man.  Why don't you just cheat the fuck out of your homework?  I don't know because we didn't have any of that growing up.  So I don't understand how they're teaching kids now.  When most of this info you could get anyway.  It's rough.  We had to learn it because that was the only way you would ever know about it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And when you got homework and went home, you had to like know the shit or look through  your books for what the fuck. 
[00:40:30]  Now, whatever question, you just pop it in and fucking there's the answer.  I don't get how, you're right, I don't know how they teach these days.  Are they just teaching them how to be real good at Googling?  At Google.  The Google.  Or are they wasting the kids' time with this shit when they can just look it up?  Exactly.  It's crazy shit.  It's strange.  You just get all your shit online?  Like there are assignments you just get online.  Right.  Like the teacher puts their fucking whole curriculum online and you just. 
[00:41:00]  Really strange.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Whatever happened to dittos?  Ah, you get a ditto.  Right?  Go home, you do your dittos.  Is that what you did?  You bet I did.  What the hell?  Excuse my French ladies.  Yeah, you do the ditto, you bring it back.  Hey, get me a cruller.  What do I know?  Well, we didn't even play the clip yet.  No.  Here's the school and what they're doing.  Hi, Mark.  It's a new principal this year here at Ipswich Middle School.  And he's making some changes.  Oh, the answer was Ipswich Clams.  What's that?  It's from a movie. 
[00:41:30]  No, no.  I'm looking at that big bulge in your pants.  Ipswich.  That's Massachusetts.  Massachusetts.  That's Massachusetts shit.  That figures.  Ipswich Middle School.  And he's making some changes.  The principal believes one special night just for honor roll students is a bad decision.  God, this is so ridiculous.  For the first time, and as long as anyone can remember, honors night is not on the calendar.  And reaction is mixed.  It's been a tradition in Ipswich.  And it's very proud.  You're very proud as a parent to go into that night and see your child as well as some of the other children that have made some, you know, really some great efforts. 
[00:42:00]  Parents were notified in an email from Ipswich Middle School principal David Fabrizio.  It reads in part,  The honors night, which can be a great sense of pride for the recipient's families, can also be devastating to a child who has worked extremely hard in a difficult class, but who, despite growth, has not been able to maintain a high grade point average.  That's fucking life!  That's called fucking life.  He just described life. 
[00:42:30]  How ridiculous.  We've said it a million times, but it's worth saying another million fucking times.  Because that same scenario in the real world, you're going to get your ass handed to you.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're not going to get a boss or a company that's going to understand that shit.  They're going to say, get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  So in school, when this shit happens, you learn workarounds and stuff.  You learn, well, maybe this isn't for me.  I've got to go find something.  Because I do believe everyone has some strength in their fucking brain, and it's up to you to figure out what that is. 
[00:43:00]  We can't promote Peterson, because everybody might feel bad that they didn't get the promotion.  That's why this doesn't make sense.  You're setting up kids that are going to get their asses handed to them when they go into the workplace.  Total failure.  I've never had an understanding boss.  Are you kidding me?  Unreal.  Holy fuck.  Un-fucking-real.  I've been blessed.  That's why this shit doesn't make sense.  I've been blessed with two understanding bosses.  Aw.  That's nice, Jimmy.  I was here in this very room.  Yeah?  I'm blessed. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my God.  Is this an out...  This is enraging, isn't it?  It's just silly.  It's silly.  It's silly.  And we've seen it.  I mean, it's happening around us.  We see these interns.  They're from this generation where, you know...  They don't want...  Go.  They used to gain the rewards and the praise without fucking doing shit.  Without the work.  And that's for Sal.  I mean, at least he works hard, but a lot of them haven't.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:44:00]  Sal.  When's the tray going down, Sam?  It couldn't be soon enough.  All right.  Good.  We're not ending honors night.  I'm not canceling education.  We're still recognizing this is a different forum.  Principal Fabrizio says honor roll members will still be recognized,  but it will happen during the school day at a general assembly where other awards will be given out.  Fabrizio says he wants the students who didn't make the honor roll to be inspired by the ones that did.  We knew there'd be some pushback, but, again, what's best for children?  If it's best for children, we believe... 
[00:44:30]  It's the scene from, like, the Bad News Bears where the...  Yeah.  What's-his-name there throws his fucking trophy, like, go fuck yourself?  That's the attitude you want.  Yeah.  Your kids to have.  It's Tanner Boyle.  Tanner Boyle.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I never...  Whatever.  Whatever.  I was an honor student, but it fucking didn't mean anything.  I got straight A's four out of five semesters, and it meant nothing.  No, you didn't.  I did. 
[00:45:00]  When I was in a junior high school.  Really?  No.  I flunked out.  Dope.  So why didn't you run home crying to your mommy that you flunked out?  Because I was too busy drinking.  There's the answer.  Man.  I had a bunch of D's.  Again, what's best for children?  It's best for children, we believe, and this is based on research and everything else,  but it's best for children to have them all together to celebrate as a school. 
[00:45:30]  The verdict is still out on whether parents will be able to attend.  David Morin would like to see his honor roll student take the stage and get the recognition  he believes she and the others deserve.  If we don't have room at the high school, we've got other bigger places we could go to.  So the principal tells us capacity will be an issue at the end of the year general assembly,  and right now school officials are trying to figure out what to do because they know  many parents will want to attend.  They're overthinking it.  Just have your stupid honors night.  God. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, the parents and the kid, you do something you're proud of, the parents  are all proud of the kid, and just totally take that away because you feel someone might  be offended.  And you know what?  A part of me, though, a small part of me goes, oh, fuck them.  You know, just thinking of these bumper stickers, these shitheads ride around with,  my friends are a lot of students.  The parents are a lot of students.  They're very proud, Jimmy.  Exactly.  Wow.  You're cum got a B. 
[00:46:30]  Who cares?  My cum got two A's in French.  Give us a fuck.  My cum shot your cum.  There is a part of it that does irritate me.  That was on a sticker.  It never bothered me, though.  It drives me nuts.  I make fun of them.  It's like fucking fake pride.  But you know, the fact of the matter is, they probably feel pretty good about themselves.  I don't know.  Part of the problem is the parents.  I'm a teacher.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to Tommy.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Tommy.  How's it going?  Can you hear me?  Allegedly a teacher.  Yeah.  The parents are the ones who are always, you know, complaining to us when the kids don't  make the honor roll.  They call the superintendent.  They try to go after our job.  So a lot of teachers, they just give up and they just give these kids A's.  Everybody's on the fucking honor roll now.  You all know the need to give a kid a disease.  A's.  What do you mean everyone's on?  What do you mean everyone gets A's?  Well, if you don't get on the honor roll now, the parents will call and complain. 
[00:47:30]  And then they go after the principals.  They go after the board of education members.  We get emails all the time.  I failed 11 out of 26 kids because they just wouldn't do work, wouldn't do homework.  And I'm trying to tell them they're not turning stuff in.  And they're still complaining at me.  Wow.  I saw one of those little drawing, little comic things.  And in the first panel, it was like, what's the parents holding the report card to the 
[00:48:00]  kid and going, you know, what's this day about?  And then it said like, you know, in the past, whatever, 19, whatever it was.  And then the next panel was now.  And the parents were yelling at the teacher.  What's this day about?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  I'll tell the teacher.  I guess you can't tell the parents to go fuck themselves, huh?  Yeah.  That would be a problem.  Thank you, sir.  Let me go to Kevin in South Carolina.  He has a really good angle on this. 
[00:48:30]  Go ahead, Kevin.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I think it's sad that, like, the honor students are told, like, hi, don't, but we can't proudly  show you, but if that school had some retard that scored a touchdown, that principal would  make sure every single news panel had it.  A retard that scores a touchdown.  They love when a retard scores a touchdown.  Well, they'll honor that, certainly.  But if you're, you know, an honor student, let's downplay that.  You're too smart.  Did you see that thing that the Pope kissed on the news?  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Holy fuck.  It looked like the fucking thing that, it definitely would have been thrown off a cliff in Sparta.  He blessed a pretzel the other day.  A pretzel?  I don't know what that was, man.  Pope gets up there and just kisses.  That was hilarious.  I got a soft spot for him.  Oh, my God.  It was just a kid that's not doing all right.  I don't know what it was.  It didn't look like a kid.  It was like a man that was all fucking bent up. 
[00:49:30]  You see it behind the curtain.  The Pope is purelling his lips.  Yes.  And then they're handing the Pope babies to kiss, and he's going, oh, you're going to have to pay me back for that one.  Oh, and you get a little older.  Here's my number.  This Pope is going to get himself in a situation, man.  I like this guy already, though.  You like the Pope?  I like that he's out there with the people, that's for sure.  Yeah.  But they're going to shut him down.  They're going to basically have a talk with him, like, look.  He don't like the Pope mobile.  But they can make another one, so fuck, let the guy, you know, get out there with the people.  What the hell?  Yeah.  You know, we're learning the Pope isn't that important anymore. 
[00:50:00]  He really isn't.  If you can make another one really quickly.  And what's the other one?  Just gone from public view.  What the fuck is that about?  I wonder if it's Alzheimer's.  They said it might be Alzheimer's or something like that.  Oh, please.  What's that about?  Like, he is hidden.  They fucking did just lock him away.  You would think he would do some kind of interview or something.  Yeah, yeah.  They just said, you're never going to see the light of day.  Oh, no.  The Pope doesn't do a lot of press.  I feel like he's in a dungeon or something right now.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Oh, they're definitely pulling some fucking Templar shit.  Templar knights are fucking holding him hostage somewhere.  They're trying to keep him fucking, you know, protected.  Yeah.  They're protecting something and just hoping.  Yeah, this is some Da Vinci code shit.  Oh, the Pope's downstairs.  Hoodily-doo.  No one's seen the Pope.  Hoodily-doo.  Oh, the Pope's not as recognizable without his hat. 
[00:51:00]  You think they don't know him either?  Because he doesn't know his hat.  Yeah, no one knows him.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  Old men just start looking exactly the same after a while.  If the old Pope there wasn't dressed like the Pope, if he was just in regular clothes,  you wouldn't be like, hey, I think that was the Pope.  And then someone's going to be like, no, that's just an old dude.  But Pope Francis, well, good for him.  Yeah, back to the other story.  So what did they decide?  They aren't going ahead with the honors? 
[00:51:30]  I don't know.  No, they're going to do it for the whole school or something and give out other awards so it's all-encompassing.  I think that's what I got out of that.  Do you know the effect that has on the country?  I mean, that's why we've stopped.  I don't see people really being amazing innovators and achieving amazing things because some people are smarter, more special,  and can figure things out and should get those jobs that give us things in this amazing country. 
[00:52:00]  I feel like he's giving me a long introduction.  Oh, like Jimmy Norton.  He's taking it all in.  He's like, you missed it.  He's like, thank you.  He's nodding.  Yes, thank you.  Like Jim Norton.  Yes.  Yeah, I don't know.  I was all fucking, I was a little bummed yesterday with this stupid picture of the Russian Soyuz capsule  that came down in Kazakhstan on a parachute in the middle of a fucking desert. 
[00:52:30]  It just smashes into the fucking ground on a parachute.  Wow.  And then the astronauts get out, and one of them's our guy.  That's the only way he can get back to Earth is in these Soyuz fucking capsules.  And it's like, what happened to, you know, to the American space program where we brought our own guys up there and back  and brought all the fucking equipment for the space station up there and did amazing things.  We did it to ourselves.  We made it way too expensive. 
[00:53:00]  They couldn't afford to do it anymore.  I don't know.  I think so.  It's a huge cost.  But as far as technology goes and the advancement of the country and technology, it's worth the money.  They cut NASA to bare bones.  And some guy yesterday was telling me, he goes, his job lets him go to, like, Edwards Air Force Base  and other places where they got that giant runway for the space shuttle.  He goes, it was so depressing to just see weeds growing through the pavement. 
[00:53:30]  And, like, it's just abandoned.  Oh, wow.  And to have our astronauts come back in this fucking glorified diving bell that just, like, it's just, it's, yeah.  And it's disheartening for this country.  You want to get the space program back together, but at any moment our government can shut down.  Well, yeah.  Because there's so much space.  At any given day we're only a couple weeks away from the government shutting down. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  They can't even figure out how to keep the government running.  But when they say we have problems on this planet, we shouldn't, you know, go out into space,  it's, like, the amazing things that happen because of a space program.  That helps the country and the world.  And it just makes American innovation.  It's an amazing thing.  But we just gave up on it.  We fucking gave up on this country creating things.  And then people yell at me, really, Bill Gates and fucking, you know, Apple and Steve Jobs stuff. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  There are a few amazing things as far as technology goes, especially in the computing world.  Right.  But I'm talking fucking, you know, amazing pieces of hardware and just us doing, you know,  building a fucking Saturn V rocket.  Holy shit.  It's a fucking skyscraper that flies and figured it out. 
[00:55:00]  Because Bill Gates and Jobs, they came from a culture where, or a generation where, like,  invention was rewarded and kind of getting ahead was rewarded and creativity was, like,  you know, now it really is.  Zuckerberg is kind of an anomaly, just a guy who did something and had a really cool idea  that just blew out of proportion.  But these guys really invented a fucking...  In their garage, fucking building shit.  So why don't we invent something and go on Shark Tank?  Oh, God.  Some kind of spacey thing.  Space shit. 
[00:55:30]  Let's do...  Let's call our company Spacey.  And I...  Yeah.  And they're privatizing the space industry.  That could work out in the end.  And that will work out in the end.  That's going to take a long time.  I get that.  It's going to take a while.  I think there shouldn't have been such a drop-off from NASA to the privatizing...  They should have kept it going for a couple more years to fill in the gap there, right?  Yeah.  I mean, you look at the space coast down there in Florida, and it's just, like, decimated. 
[00:56:00]  All the business is gone.  It's just...  Sad.  Yeah, it is sad, because that was such a major part of what made the country amazing.  Was it...  America's space program could be looked at as amazing as us, you know, helping win World  War II, and just doing such amazing things in the medical field that we did.  It was so special for our country.  Fucking amazing.  No one else was even close to doing what we were doing.  Not Russia what they thought they were until they barbecued their fucking cosmonauts. 
[00:56:30]  Right, right, right, as they're on the radio going, you motherfuckers, you have killed  me.  Poor bastard.  We got to go back to the honor story, because we got a principal.  I want to just hear a principal on this one.  He's going to explain some shit to us.  OD in Massachusetts.  How you doing, boys?  Are they...  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[00:57:00]  Are they ever going to fix that?  Well, it's...  What?  The monitor.  I'll tell you, I just did this.  It's a little high.  I just do it to annoy everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it should just be fixed.  I don't know how you'd fix it.  You move it over.  Oh, that would entail drilling another hole in the console.  Stop.  They don't want to drill ugly holes in this console, right?  No drilling, no cutting.  OD, sorry about that.  Go ahead.  I'm going to deal with these other pussy principals, and I know my phone will be ringing today saying,  are you going to get rid of your honor roll, because this school did. 
[00:57:30]  And it's just, we had an award.  Four kids wanted the top four kids out of 700.  Only four made the cut.  Wow.  Good for them four.  They did it.  They earned it.  They worked hard.  Right.  Like you said, they're going to have a boss someday, and they're going to say, oh, no,  everyone gets raised because everyone smiled nicely.  Yeah, as long as you smile nice, you get to.  Right.  But do you have to deal with the parents?  Are they a pain in the ass, or what?  Oh, you do.  You do.  You do the little side step. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  You could have tried harder, but it's nonsense.  If they grew a set of balls, they wouldn't do it, but they just don't want to put up  the fight.  Right.  All right, sir.  Thank you, OD.  Well, I think Carlin talks about honor students, doesn't he, Rock?  Yes, he does.  I want to get a break with this.  Sure.  The great George Carlin hit it.  Here's another pack of low-grade morons who ought to be locked into portable toilets  and set on fire.  These people with bumper stickers that say, we are the proud parents of an honor student 
[00:58:30]  at the Franklin School.  You know?  Or the Midvale Academy, or whatever other innocent-sounding name has been assigned to  the indoctrination center, where their child has been sent to be stripped of his individuality  and turned into an obedient, soul-dead, conformist member of the American consumer culture.  Proud parents, what kind of empty people need to validate themselves through the achievements 
[00:59:00]  of their children?  How would you like to have to live with a couple of these misfits?  How's that science project coming along, Justin?  Fuck you, Dad.  You simple-minded prick.  Mind your own business and pass the Cheerios.  Here's a bumper sticker I'd like to see.  We are the proud parents of a child whose self-esteem is sufficient that he doesn't need us promoting  his minor scholastic achievements on the back of our car.  That was pretty sick, yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Or, we are the proud parents of a child who has resisted his teacher's attempts to break  his spirit and bend him to the will of his corporate masters.  Just be a nice little for change, you know?  Here's something realistic.  We have a daughter in public school who hasn't been knocked up yet.  We have a son in public school who hasn't shot any of his classmates yet. 
[01:00:00]  But he does sell drugs to your honor student.  Plus, he knocked up your daughter.  Then there are the people who aren't too proud of their children.  We are the embarrassed parents of a cross-eyed little nitwit who, at the age of 10, not only  continues to wet the bed, but also shits on the school bus.  Something like that on the back of the car might give the child a little more incentive,  you know? 
[01:00:30]  Get him to try a little harder next semester.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, this is The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Nice.  Been waiting for this all day.  Let's listen to this for a minute.  I hit the ramp right there.  No, I ramped.  I ramped that shit like Danny.  Belly Blue! 
[01:01:00]  Belly Blue!  why are we listening to well you too joshua tree 26 years ago today was released oh i always go

[01:02:30]  how long 26 you go 13 and another 13 87 87 yes wow 1987 80s i was watching a show from the 80s last  night um i was watching uh miami vice on netflix really it's hilarious does that hold up uh no  oh really no why uh why does it hold up well uh one of the uh stangle brothers um tweeted  there you go nice he tweeted you gotta you gotta check out uh smugglers blues right from season one 
[01:03:00]  i'm like i kind of remember this you know so i i found it and i i start watching it and it's  of course the one with glenn fry right from the eagles who wrote smugglers blues right and they  apparently made an entire episode out of his song based on the song based on his song i don't  remember with some dialogue actually taken right from the song right they some of the lines of the  show were right lyrics from the song right but it was very 80s very i mean and then and then it  takes you right out of it because i'm like oh there's the chick that eddie murphy fucked in 48 
[01:03:30]  hours she's in it and like oh wow there's one of the guys from the garage uh that stole ferris  bueller's uh the fucking car when they parked it in ferris bueller right right uh and um  yeah it was it was it was pretty bad it was pretty bad very hokey i gotta watch it but um  boy it just smugglers blues the big it's the politics of contraband it's the smugglers blues  no i hate that song the lead-up was ridiculous just to get to smugglers blues listen to it 
[01:04:00]  the payoffs in the river  they made an entire episode about it that's classic was it a very special episode uh it wasn't a special  episode but uh a little trivia on that one there it is a little trivia on that song glenn fry's  character i guess was supposed to die at the end but then um they they realized that they could  probably use him in later episodes right so he gets shot and the second he gets shot he goes to 
[01:04:30]  crockett he's like i'm you hear it dubbed in so poorly you hear i'm okay how can you be okay  he it's the how do you know first of all how do you know you're okay the second you're shot right  it was right after he got shot you might want to like go to a hospital they'll tell you if you're  okay or not and he goes i'm okay and it's badly dubbed in because they wanted to keep his  character alive right and then you don't see him the rest of the show like he's just gone 
[01:05:00]  and they never acknowledge him because he was just supposed to be another character that died  well did he ever come back i think he did okay i think they they did bring him back  you'd be cool for 20 hours and i'll pay you 20 grand  the payoffs and the ripoffs  now that i'm hearing this song which i haven't heard in years 
[01:05:30]  this song was huge back then as was miami vice first season of miami vice was great at the time  like when that fucking show premiered there was a huge publicity build up for it where they play uh  uh phil collins song uh in the air tonight it was like that was their their big thing and they would  show like a lot of neon a lot of fucking miami shit and they had the the camera on the side of

[01:09:00]  yeah  like george thoroughgood  it's all right  i'm not a big george thoroughgood fan  i know why too  why  It's because he's doing the blues thing.  It's a little too bluesy.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Anything with da-da-da-da-da, it hates.  He did have some bluesy hits, though, like this.  This had, you know, video on MTV and shit.  I like a lot of George Thurgood songs, to be honest with you.  I can't stand it.  I can't stand his fucking... 
[01:09:30]  The baddest in blues, the baddest in blues, the baddest...  Oh, shut up.  Born to be bad.  Red.  Petitive.  Give me some of those Thurgood songs, E-Rock.  What do we got?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  This is all right.  This is bar music.  This is down and dirty bar music, eh?  I think George has a drinking problem.  He might.  He might.  And even though it's a long fucking...  And even though it's a long build-up, one bourbon, one scotch, one beer... 
[01:10:00]  Oh, God.  He talks for, what, three to four minutes and then finally gets into it?  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Oh.  George Thurgood and the Delaware Destroyers.  That's right.  All right.  I went with fucktorn.  It's kind of like a Valby tune. 
[01:10:30]  Move it on over.  Move it on over.  Love it on over.  Love it on over.  Love it on over.  Love it on over.  Love it on over.  Love it on over.  He rocked it.  He's mixing the tunes.  Let him go.  Exactly.  Well, I ain't seen my baby season around.  Got one bourbon.  You don't like that guitar at all?  Got one damn one bourbon.  No.  Even though...  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  I hate anything that goes beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  I don't like that at all. 
[01:11:00]  I could do that.  Oh.  You don't like that guitar at all?  Not really.  Fuck.  Not really.  It doesn't really...  It doesn't do anything.  What else you got?  Is this the Miami Vice one with George Thurgood?  Hey, John, thank you, brother.  Oh, boy.  We'll let John go in Mobile.  This is the other side of his career, I think. 
[01:11:30]  A little bit, right?  Yeah.  He was trying to keep it going.  Oh, no.  Look at the game.  All right.  Let's go to the Miami Vice one.  Why is the gang wearing a fucking Boy George hat? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, my God.  What do they have written on their car?  This is the Badge of the Bone episode?  All right.  Now we're watching Miami Vice.  It's the guys sitting in the...  Oh, they're...  That's the gang.  One has a pink hat.  One has a leather vest.  A light-skinned black guy and two white guys.  He looks like Ducky, right?  Yeah.  He's wearing the hat.  How would you start on top of his hair, like, with his hair all sticking out around it?  It looks...  Unless you think he's got in the sack. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, does he have panties on his head?  Yeah, and they're all hot.  Is that what they're on?  You need the bag, okay?  Is this supposed to be strung out?  Very stupid.  Oh, shit.  Whoa, big gunfight on the beach.  Wow, this is bad.  I swear, that's the boy George had.  You don't look so bad.  Here's another...  Hey, wait a minute.  That's Bernie Gess's line.  And he's trying to be like, uh...  Eric Roberts. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, this is terrible.  This fucking stinks.  That's pretty bad.  Death, the ultimate what?  It says on the car?  Death, the ultimate high.  The ultimate high.  On the side of their gagging car.  Oh, that's awful.  That's the worst gang ever.  Yeah, it's a terrible gang.  That's it?  You know, another horrid gang was on the other night, an episode of MacGyver.  It was a black gang.  Okay.  A black gang on an episode of MacGyver.  And the dialogue that was coming out was so fucking bad. 
[01:13:30]  Like MacGyver had to deal with a gang.  Did he have to learn their language or something?  I think so.  Yeah, my buddy Vinny was sending me clips of it saying,  this is so fucking embarrassing.  And I was, uh...  Yeah, I was...  Let me see if he's got one here.  I don't know if you're going to be able to hear it very well, because it's so...  How many years is Miami Vice on?  Three, four years?  How long? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  1995.  Grunge.  84 to 89.  Oh, okay.  1990 wiped it out.  Let me see if I could see what this sounds like.  What is...  What is...  Yeah, I'm on this Oliver Street.  What's up, R-Rock?  I'm serious, tip-home boy.  I found out at 12 o'clock tomorrow.  Boom.  Gumman's getting with the Oliver Street gang at the abandoned fools.  Matter of fact, man, check it.  The gumman came to the tire shop where I worked today to get a change on his truck.  Wait, you had the gumman and you didn't bring him down? 
[01:14:30]  Why, man?  Because my brother's going to go to the joint because of the gumman.  That's why.  Because of the gumman.  You can't really hear it.  The best line was...  The best line was...  Wait, what did he say?  Oh, it was something that...  Chicky.  Can you find that?  Chicky.  MacGyver.  MacGyver.  I don't know which episode, though.  It's like some gang.  But somebody might have uploaded the gang in MacGyver.  Yeah, MacGyver and the gang or something.  What did he just say that was so not gang-ish? 
[01:15:00]  Not gang-ish?  Fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, guns and boys, maybe.  That sounds like a...  Yep, that's the one.  Yeah, guns and boys.  It was like Boys in the Hood.  Ha ha, come on.  It was terrible.  Wow.  I love when they were trying to tackle, like, issues of the day.  And it just failed miserably.  That gang in Miami Vice.  Death.  The ultimate...  They rode it in spray paint on their own car.  Yeah, wouldn't you pull them over? 
[01:15:30]  Do you know how easy they are to find?  Yes.  Very easy to find.  Yeah, there'd be a guy with underwear on his head and another guy who looks like Ducky.  And another guy with a cheesy leather vest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this it?  No.  Oh, it's a commercial.  What the...  Wow, how do you just find a MacGyver clip?  On CBS?  Are they crazy?  Why do they give a shit?  I don't...  I use it a lot in my act.  Do you?  Like, I'm like MacGyver when I'm talking about putting things together. 
[01:16:00]  I'm like, uh...  Or somebody will yell something from the audience.  I'll be like, what are you, mixing and matching these two things?  Thanks a lot, MacGyver.  Ah, it fucking gets laughs, right?  It sure does.  Wow.  You think that's been overused in comedy?  It's fucking...  It makes me...  It's like how you can tell somebody so they're drummed out of the business.  All right, let's see.  Hold on.  Here he goes talking to some homeboys.  All right.  Where is it?  I can't hear it.  I can't hear it.  I can't hear it.  Do it!  They live large, man. 
[01:16:30]  Uh-oh.  The music.  Here comes MacGyver now.  His shirt tucked in.  They're hiding the guns in the trunk.  At least there's guns.  Who are you?  He was MacGyver.  Oh, he's got his hands in his pockets, looped.  It's tough.  Oh, he's the good kid.  Gonna be bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very gang-like.  Yeah.  He's got his thumbs in his pocket. 
[01:17:00]  I don't know.  Oliver Street gang, we run this hill.  Now, I'm Player G, and these are my boys.  Hey, old homegirl.  Wanna take a ride in my car?  Huh?  See the real world?  Son, why don't you leave?  No, no, no.  The name's Player G, baby.  Ha, ha, ha.  The name's Player G.  I'm Player C.  He's sneaking over here into my home, right?  White, oh.  Is he in there?  He's not involving gangs anymore.  Oh.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:17:30]  Brian, what are you doing?  All right, all right.  So.  Chill it out, chill out.  Oh, listen to the white bread trying to talk like he's one of the homies, huh?  Oh.  Is he looking for me?  Hey, well, you on my turf, wild thing.  Ain't nothing to me, punk.  Brian, you and Kelvin go inside now.  Oh, mama.  He's got no respect.  Mama?  No, no, there ain't no pretty thing like that.  Gonna be dropping no huggie fool like you.  It's a good punk.  This is so bad.  Oh.  MacGyver, I love MacGyver.  Oh, shit.  He pulled a gas.  All right.  I'm fine with my nine. 
[01:18:00]  I'm fine with my nine.  Ain't nothing to me, punk.  Oh.  Put the gun down.  It's 5-0.  5-0.  Hurry, there's no be traveling over there.  Come on, man.  Come on, let's go.  Oh, the guy is still like breaking.  They're dressed like the breaking group.  Yes, yes.  Oh, look at MacGyver holding the guy back lamely.  This is them trying to address the gang issue, I guess.  This is horrendous.  Wow, was that bad?  MacGyver's a douche.  MacGyver trying to address the gang issue. 
[01:18:30]  I wonder what he makes.  He's got to concoct something.  He makes a cracker mask for his face that they can all jerk off onto.  Did he make something every week?  Oh, yeah.  He had to.  Oh, he had to.  He had to make something every week.  He had to improvise some fucking cool shit.  He's MacGyver.  Hey, thanks a lot, MacGyver.  Yeah.  Who are you, MacGyver?  Or somebody will yell something.  I'm like, good point, Magellan.  You could combine two and go, what are you, MacGyver on steroids?  Yeah, this guy's over there building like MacGyver on crack or something. 
[01:19:00]  It's all cracked out.  Wow, that's a good one.  That's MacGyver.  Hey, you have to MacGyver from hell.  Oh, from hell.  Yeah, anything from hell.  Jimmy, you should use that in Syracuse this weekend.  Yeah.  You should do a MacGyver joke, I think.  You know what?  If you want to get in some tickets on Saturday, you're going to have to call MacGyver to build  you some seats.  Oh, well.  That's quite work.  Because I understand on Friday, the ticket rush from hell happened.  And on Friday, it might be sold out, too. 
[01:19:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Syracuse is loving the Jim Norton.  Yeah.  I think Friday and Saturday will be totally sold out.  Good for you, Syracuse.  Let's say hi to Robert in Tennessee.  Hey there, babe.  I guess bad gangs.  Robert.  Hey, guys.  How about the gang on Crocodile Dundee 2 when he had to go rescue his girlfriend from  the drug dealer?  What a pussy gang that was, huh?  I don't remember.  Colin was in Crocodile Dundee 2, right?  That's true, yes.  The idiot that he is, he rewrote the second half of the script.  Did he?  Yeah.  You know Colin's fucking story about the second half of the script for Crocodile Dundee 2? 
[01:20:00]  I didn't know he wrote.  No, he tried to.  Oh, he tried to.  Oh, no.  He fucking, I hope he's awake right now, fucking bleary-eyed from not sleeping, dipping his  stupid fucking, his muffin in tea.  Hey, I hope he's awake to call.  I don't want to tell this story, but it's very, it's one of my favorite stories.  Is it a real story?  Oh, it's 100% real.  Because you never know what the...  It's 100% real.  I've got to hear this. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  What part did Colin have in Crocodile Dundee 2?  He fucking, he had like a little part.  Yeah.  He was, you know, let's be honest, probably wasn't a big one.  And he just had some ideas on what the second half of the script should be.  He actually approached somebody as a guy with a relatively small part on a movie and approached  someone with what he thinks should happen in the second half.  Yeah.  He is a madman.  But Crocodile Dundee 2 didn't do well, right? 
[01:21:00]  I think it did all right.  It did all right.  It wouldn't have done worse if his ideas had gone wrong.  We're calling him right now.  Let's see if he's up.  Wow.  Or maybe after the break.  I don't know.  Whenever he wakes up.  His tweets about the show Girls and his interaction with Lena Dunham, whatever her name is, are fucking  hilarious.  Just fucking hilarious.  About what a great actor he is and how everyone tells him how fantastic he is. 
[01:21:30]  If I would have known that you look this good, like, wow, I would have put a romantic scene  in the wolf.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just, it's so fucking funny.  He's the greatest tweeter ever.  He really is.  Wish I followed him.  Oh, Jimmy.  He's not answering.  Nah, we're going up.  He's sleepy.  I want to come, okay?  I'm going to answer.  Yeah.  I'm going to hire.  Yeah.  He wrote, um, he wrote himself into the second half of the movie as, like, the guy who shows  Dundee around New York.  And he presented it to, like, the director or the producers. 
[01:22:00]  What a set of balls.  What an absolute asshole.  Yes.  He gave it to the...  I gotta hear the story from his mouth.  Oh, God.  You gotta look at this picture.  It's the fucking, they take these rooftop feet photos.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that picture.  You think it's real?  Oh, yeah.  It's 100% real.  Holy shit.  Why can't they be green screening or what?  Well, it could be.  It's a guy from National Geographic who took it.  Oh, it is.  All right.  Well...  He's standing on top of the Burj Khalif Tower.  He's on the highest point.  But he's holding on to something.  Of course, but it doesn't matter.  I would do that.  Oh, no.  I swear to God I would do that.  No, you wouldn't.  You wouldn't even go on the Eagle, which is fucking... 
[01:22:30]  No, because he could hold on to something.  That's the difference.  No, he's not on that.  Didn't you just say he's holding on to something?  Someone's probably holding him.  That's the highest point you can go.  That's the highest point you can go.  Is that outside the nest or whatever they call it?  That's at the top of the nest.  Show me where he is in another picture.  Go to Burj.  Go to Burj.  This picture's making the rounds.  It's going viral.  It is an impressive photo.  Burj Tower.  I'm trying to figure out where he is, though.  No, no.  Go...  Jeez, Louise. 
[01:23:00]  That's insane.  I'll show you where he is.  I'll show you.  It looks like there's a spot where he can hold on.  Tippity top.  No, go to videos of Top of the Burj.  There's one video which will show you where he is.  Okay.  There it is.  That's creepy.  This one where these guys are sitting up there.  Jesus.  Right there.  Can you see his...  Oh, can you...  Go, I'm sorry.  He's standing where those guys are sitting.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  He might be able to hold that thing behind him. 
[01:23:30]  I will shut the fuck up now.  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  There's no reason to be there.  You think he's holding on to that thing over there?  He might be, yeah.  But still.  Might have he dropped his camera and reached for it?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  That's a great photo.  Colin Quinn.  We got him.  We got Colin.  Hi, Carl.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  I'm okay.  I just took a hot one last night.  We did a gig down here.  Where are you?  Oh, you're in Atlanta.  That's right.  Hot Atlanta?  No, I haven't gotten to Atlanta yet. 
[01:24:00]  I was in D.C.  Ah.  You bombed?  Oh.  What happened?  What gig was it?  I was just thinking.  What happened?  They had ears.  They weren't expecting that type of rhetoric.  Oh, Colin.  That type of inflammatory rhetoric, as we say nowadays.  I would think some of your views would be very welcome down there. 
[01:24:30]  I would think the world would be shockproof at this point, but apparently not.  Oh.  So were you in a comedy club or was it a private gig?  It was like a little private event.  It wasn't that bad, but it was, you know.  We're talking about Crocodile Dundee 2 and the bad gang scene in that.  Oh, yeah.  And I relayed the fact that you felt you deserved a bigger party.  Yeah.  You did not actually approach anyone that had anything to do with this film and try to get 
[01:25:00]  a rewrite going, did you?  No, no.  I didn't try to get a rewrite.  I rewrote.  And my girlfriend typed up the entire rewrite of the second half of Crocodile Dundee 2.  Me with the one line, the tuxedo onlooker.  I didn't even have a name.  Onlooker.  I rewrote it.  Charles Dutton, who I didn't even know, I just read the script. 
[01:25:30]  I was like, this is not a New York script.  I knew I'd done comedy for like five months.  I'm like, I'm going to open, Micah.  I rewrote the whole script, handed it in.  Charles Dutton was out.  And guess who was leading Paul Hogan around New York?  Colin Quinn.  That's correct.  The tuxedo onlooker.  You wrote yourself into the movie more?  You wrote a bigger part for yourself?  More at the co-star.  And submitted it? 
[01:26:00]  That's great.  What a set of fucking balls.  What kind of reaction did you get?  Just a deluded arrogance.  I mean, I guess I was lucky.  Like, they were Australian.  They were just like, yeah, yeah.  I just kind of ignored it and stopped the director.  I actually asked her.  Did you get the rewrite?  Oh, how douchey.  Douchey.  Don't you wish you still had a copy of that?  I wish I had a copy of that script. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, gosh.  I wish I could have really had the guy on tape when somebody told him.  That's true.  Were you imagining what it would be like when they go like, oh, this is great.  Let's get him in for a meeting.  Yeah.  No, I mean, literally, it's not like I looked like even a normal douche would look afterwards,  like during the, when he was on the set, would have looked away from the director like,  I'm embarrassed. 
[01:27:00]  I literally looked him in the eye and was like, what happened?  Oh, were you fucking naive?  What an ass.  Absolutely.  I love it.  Oh, that's so fucking douchey.  Real jerk.  Man.  A true jerk on the set.  The guy that comes up to me and goes, hey, man, you know.  I was like, I was that douche times ten.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How would you like if some guy came up to you and told you how you should do your act? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  He came up with a stupid script.  Right.  That's who you were.  The girl was probably looking at me like, what an asshole.  I can't believe I'm a dangerous idiot.  Probably thought that beforehand.  How long did it take you to rewrite it?  I don't know.  Probably like about a few days.  Did you write action scenes in?  I think it was mostly just. 
[01:28:00]  I mostly.  It was actually.  I remember it took place in like Queens, Long Island.  So I put it in Brooklyn.  I think I gave myself like a few monologues.  Monologues.  They really happened.  But they weren't even that exciting in my life.  So I could tell Paul Hosen, you know, just be like, hey, man, like this is authentic.  This is real Brooklyn.  Real New York.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to love this.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:28:30]  How fucking embarrassing.  That's terrible.  Years later, I'm cringing.  And I guess years later, I'm barely cringing.  That's the problem.  The movie wasn't accurate anyway.  How about the fact that they've written already like the top hit of like two years before,  and I'm still rewriting the second part.  Paul Warren was a giant.  And I'm parading.  If you could have seen me walk around that set, you would have thought I was the lead. 
[01:29:00]  Really?  I was so, like, confident.  I was just so, like, I had no idea about, like, you know.  Because I was doing stand-up in New York, I was like, hey, you know, I'm like a big shot.  You hadn't been beaten down yet.  No, and it was also the 80s.  So when you said, I'm a stand-up comic, everybody would go, what?  You're a watch?  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, later, people are like, oh, my cousin does it, you know?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Well, Carl, that's quite a story there. 
[01:29:30]  I actually felt a little bad for you.  Just imagining.  I didn't feel bad for him.  He's fucking stupid.  That was a great fucking movie.  Oh, Chipper.  Kind of wasn't.  Chipper's really gotten, Chipper's gotten very vile and profane lately.  But, yeah, something's going on.  I'm letting my freak flag fly.  Just got to be myself.  I think it's happened to his mother at the same age. 
[01:30:00]  My mother said, Chipper, let your star shine bright.  Delightful woman.  No, she wasn't.  All right, Carl.  No, she wasn't.  Have fun at the punchline.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  That's funny, man.  Oh, my God.  What a set of balls.  How embarrassing.  And then being on the set after.  Like, you know that the guys probably talked about.  Like, you know what this fucking idiot did?  Do you know what this fucking dumb extra did? 
[01:30:30]  And then they read it.  I'm sure they read it to each other.  Look, look, look at this line.  He's got himself saying this.  And then he comes in the next day like, hey, guys.  So, how did it go?  He's got to have a copy of that somewhere.  Did you read it?  Hmm.  He's got to have that in a file somewhere.  It wasn't in the digital age and the paper they used back then.  No, you know why?  It decomposes.  It was probably typed up.  It wasn't on a computer.  It was probably just typed up.  He probably handed it in and lost it.  That was it.  Oh, wow. 
[01:31:00]  Maybe someone has it out there.  I'd pay $500 for that.  Easily.  Fucking writes Charles Dutton out of the show, out of the movie, to write himself in.  That's brilliant.  Smart.  Yeah, it is.  All right.  What do we got to break there, E-Rock?  Anything good?  Mr. E to the R?  Nah, not really.  All right.  We got a live read, though.  Wonderful.  Yeah, boy.  You really took the move down to nothing.  You can learn a thing or two from Denny. 
[01:31:30]  You can learn a thing or two from Denny.  Yep.  You just gave everyone the opportunity to change the channel.  Yeah.  Because you told them there's nothing worth hearing when we go to break here.  Yeah.  Yeah, you pile of thoughts.  Denny would have something going on, right?  He'd be teasing something.  I don't know.  Teasing, talking something up, fucking promoting something that was going on, maybe even on another  channel.  Right.  Oh, he's just a team player.  Can we have Denny tease what's coming up next?  Oh, it'd be great. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, let me go grab him.  Yeah?  You want me to go grab him?  All right.  All right.  In the meantime, Ann will do the live read, and then Denny will absolutely tease what's  coming up next.  E-Rock music!  I like that.  Your razor doesn't need that vibrating handling, does it?  Backscratcher 10 blades.  Seriously, you notice the price you're paying for these new razor blades?  It's how much?  Is that in pesos?  I hate that line.  No, it doesn't make sense.  You're doing this every month for the rest of your life, right? 
[01:32:30]  Mm-hmm.  This is your Dollar Shave Club moment.  And it's time to join all those Opie and Anthony listeners who've discovered DollarShaveClub.com.  Listen here.  Here's what the buzz is all about.  It's like found money.  All you guys want is a great shave without shilling out 20 bucks a month, month after month, right?  Dollar Shave Club is genius.  You'd be crazy not to do this.  You send them a couple of bucks a month, and they deliver amazing quality razor blades right  to your door.  You save a fortune.  Plus, you always have fresh blades on hand. 
[01:33:00]  No more zombying out your face with old blades because you can't afford or forget to buy new  ones.  Join the rest of the Opie and Anthony listeners and get a great shave.  Keep your cash at DollarShaveClub.com.  DollarShaveClub.com.  Oh, yes.  That would be DollarShaveClub.com.  Oh, look at that.  Perfect timing.  Denny!  There he is.  Of course it's perfect timing.  Denny, obviously you're a radio professional.  We can all learn a thing or two from you, sir.  Good morning. 
[01:33:30]  Good morning.  And we wanted to go to break, and I go, E-Rock, what do you got?  And his answer was nothing.  Is that bad?  It's bad.  He didn't do his show prep today.  Isn't it bad to go to break, tell the listeners there's nothing?  Got to keep them holding on.  Holding on.  You tell them, Denny.  Got to keep them, you know, what's coming up next.  And so it keeps them glued to the radio.  Right.  Glued to the radio.  You don't need them switching off.  You never want them to change the channel.  There's always something going on, right?  There should be. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So I know we're doing this cold, but could you, like, tease something coming up?  I don't care what you got.  It could be some of your show prep.  You can even make it up.  We don't care.  Just make it sound exciting and make it sound like people don't want to tune away.  You can do something from your clipboard.  We don't care.  Yeah, you know what?  We can make believe this is an oldie station.  He just asked me to come in and tease something, so I was just putting together my prep.  Oh, right.  Oh, you haven't started yet?  No, I haven't started yet.  You got your clipboard.  No, because I was doing some other projects they had me working on. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, what kind of project?  Well, you know what we need?  Moving desks.  What's that?  Moving some desks around the...  I'm trying to get the fish tank put in the studio for you guys.  That would be wonderful.  I was talking about that the other day.  Yeah.  But you know what we do need in here so you could talk up records a lot?  The hot clock.  You don't have the hot clock.  What's the hot clock?  Hot clock, Ovi?  What's a hot clock?  When you hit the button for the song, the clock starts immediately, so it starts counting.  Oh, I remember that.  So you know about ramp times.  If you're looking at it, you have 12 seconds to go.  I ramped something today, Denny. 
[01:35:00]  Did you?  Yeah, U2 song.  It was a little sloppy, but I got to the fucking vocals.  Long intro on those U2 songs, too.  Sure.  Yeah, because it was 26 years ago today.  Joshua Tree was released.  There you go.  See, and he did that.  He did a little rampant.  That would have done very well on, like, the 80s channel.  I didn't end with call letters or anything, though.  You should always open and close with call letters.  You remember that?  Yes.  You have to open and close the mic.  Sirius XM, 60s on 6, so, so, so, so, so.  Here on Sirius XM.  We always got to open and close.  Open and close with your calls. 
[01:35:30]  Double calls.  What are you doing?  I used to like the jingle packages that had double call letters in there.  Oh.  97 W, Y, and Y.  Y, and Y, and Y, and then it would always have that double call letter in there.  You enjoyed them?  Oh, yeah.  You don't collect jingles?  No.  He collects jingles.  We used to do that on Friday nights at the radio station.  Oh.  We'd get off the air and maybe get a couple of pizzas in there and go through air checks  or listen to jingle packages from years gone by.  Really?  Wow.  Those are great.  Hell of a Friday night.  I love it.  What was your favorite jingle? 
[01:36:00]  One of the packages I always liked was when WPIX FM in New York was a top 40 station.  They had a package called the Synergy Package.  Oh, it was a great jingle package.  You'd have a ramp in part of the jingle, so you'd be talking it up.  You could talk up the jingle, like what's coming up, and then the call at us would just go,  WPIX FM, 102.1.9, whatever it was.  Yeah.  And WABC always had the greatest jingles.  97 W, Y, Y.  Ah, there you go.  My first song with a girl, Sticks. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Do-do-do-do-do-lay.  Remember when WPIX was Love Songs?  Nothing but Love Songs?  Love Songs.  They were every format possible.  Oh, yeah.  They could have had every format back in the top 40 days.  Back in the 70s, they used to do Disco 102 at night.  Disco 102?  So they could have been the disco station, the dance station.  Then they did the top 40.  Is this a whole jingles package you found?  I think it's longer than that.  I think it's a bunch of air checks.  Oh, yeah, it'd be great.  You'd have guys trading air checks.  You'd call up and say, hey, you have Robert W. Morgan, 
[01:37:00]  or if you had guys from Seattle, Andy Barber on the KING,  and all these different things, you'd just trade them with people.  And they'd listen to them?  Yeah, you'd listen to them, and you'd get inspired.  Like, wow, that guy, you know, he did a great, you know.  There's just so many.  Jackson Armstrong, and the guy was fantastic.  You ever listen to his stuff?  Jackson Armstrong.  He was fantastic, yeah.  He was made of Jackson Armstrong air check.  All top 40 disc jockeys back in the day. 
[01:37:30]  What made him fantastic, though?  Just his energy and his whole thing, how he put everything together.  He just always sounded exciting.  He's fantastic.  That one's a good one.  He's got the best clothes in it.  It just went on.  I'm not even a free ride.  Great skin.  If you don't know what Jeopardy DSC,  you find out what kind of a holiday that the ball is at.  He had a wild one.  Got pinched for masquerading as a woman.  Not here.  Wow.  Ah, this is Radio 93.  KKHR.

All that info he was getting out there.  All fast, high energy.  What's that, Sam?  I can't believe he's doing it sitting down.  Yeah, that's true.  Can you imagine if he stood up?  But you see him?  He's like fucking moving.  Yeah, he's no longer with us.  He's in rock and roll heaven.  Oh, no.  What year was he on?  He was a 70s and 80s disc jockey.  He also worked into the 90s.  Wow.  He was fantastic.  Jackson what? 
[01:39:00]  Jackson Armstrong.  That was...  Just a great name, too.  Jackson Armstrong.  Jackson Armstrong.  Danny, Donnie, Joe Jordan, and John Beck.  You're so much good.  Tomorrow night in Nassau, you're going.  Make me look good.  What's that?  That's Kid Kelly.  He works right here.  See, he stands up.  Yeah.  Just stand-up operation.  Yeah.

We don't have any prizes.  Stop set.  Coming back.  Keep them across.  Across the old stop set.  We haven't had a real prize in years.  It was true.  Even opening Anthony t-shirts.  People love t-shirts.  We haven't had t-shirts either.  We haven't had any t-shirts.  We really do.  And see what you could do.  Maybe you could sell the back.  Get a sponsorship on that.  People want to know if you like the Midnight Rambler. 
[01:40:00]  The Midnight Rambler by the Rolling Stones?  No, I guess there was a disc jockey in the Midnight Rambler.  Never heard of him.  I'm not familiar with him.  What market was he in?  Never heard of him, sir.  What market was he in?  We have $500 from Steven Singer.  We do?  Mm-hmm.  All right, well, we're not giving that away.  We want to do something special with that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't just give that to a caller.  No.  Sorry, Denny.  How about your brackets?  Were you guys working on your brackets yesterday?  Oh, we sure were.  Because the NCAA started.  Well, the brackets.  That's pretty exciting.  And we've got a channel that talks nothing but brackets here. 
[01:40:30]  And what channel is that?  What channel would that be, Sam?  I don't know.  It sounds like a horrible channel.  You know what?  I just thought March Madness.  I thought we have a March Madness channel.  I thought I printed out.  See, what's good to do is I should print out all the channels so you always have them at  your fingertips.  What a great idea.  It's got folders and clipboards.  Exactly.  He is so prepared.  I was working on my show prep.  I feel so guilty leaving my house with nothing in my hands.  I know.  I don't.  I love it.  I love just flailing my hands emptily in the arm.  It's good to be, you know, spontaneous. 
[01:41:00]  It sure is.  It's always good.  Oh, Channel 91.  Thank you, Sam, for grabbing hold of the SiriusXM College Sports Nation.  And it really is a nation.  It's the best college sports talk and games.  Are you guys into fantasy sports?  Are you guys into fantasy leagues?  Oh, big time.  Fantasy football is all the rage.  I'm playing golf and a woman tinkles on me.  That's my fantasy.  There's also NASCAR Fantasy.  Oh, what?  Yeah, and there's a NASCAR Fantasy League also.  That's crazy.  Oh, people just enjoy all this stuff.  Yeah.  And the good thing about Sirius is we actually have a channel for fantasy sports. 
[01:41:30]  Thank God for Sirius.  That would be Channel 87.  87.  You want to know how good Denny is?  Yeah.  He made up that bullshit about NASCAR just now while the page was waiting to load so he  wouldn't have to hesitate before announcing the channel number.  Right.  No, there was.  There is a NASCAR.  I know, but I mean, you know, you didn't care.  I don't know.  I guess you put different people on your team, different drivers or something.  But, no, you just always have to.  It's good to be spontaneous because you guys are the king of spontaneity.  Oh, we try.  But you know what?  That's all we have.  You've got the newspapers in front of you, Jim. 
[01:42:00]  You've got to be prepared.  You should go through them and you see what's going on.  There's a lot of things.  He's teaching us.  TV is always good to say, hey, by the way, tonight you've got the season debut of whatever.  I just don't want to promote TV shows because they all stink.  Well, no.  You see, back in the day, that was an old rule.  We used to have consultants say, don't ever talk about a TV show because it takes them away  from the radio.  Ah, right.  Remember that?  You could never, you know, you could never, you could say, boy, last night on Carson,  did you see when Rickles came out and he broke Carson's ashtray or something like that?  That would be funny.  Right.  But you could never talk about, you know. 
[01:42:30]  Something coming up.  Yeah, but it's, which is kind of stupid because, hey, by the way, Bon Jovi's going to be on,  you know, Jimmy Fallon tonight.  And we've got a Bon Jovi channel.  So you could just.  Ah, look at that.  We've got a Bon Jovi channel coming on.  If you talked about what happened last night.  Starting tomorrow at 3 o'clock.  Starting tomorrow at 3.  Did you know this?  I didn't know this.  No idea.  If you talked about what happened last night, wouldn't people just turn off the radio and  look it up on YouTube?  Well.  Well, back in the day, they couldn't do that.  Oh.  Right.  Back in the day.  But it's good.  By the way, no, you put that on your website.  Hey, we've got that clip last night of, you know, Bon Jovi.  Uh-huh. 
[01:43:00]  How about if you were promoting a guest on another radio show at that moment?  No, you wouldn't do that.  Wouldn't you do that?  I know you wouldn't do that.  Like you being on stage saying you could go see so-and-so across the street.  Well, right, next door, yeah.  Well, Sirius has no problem having promos for other morning shows on our channel.  And they have one for you guys, too.  But we're one big happy family, so it doesn't matter.  We don't really have promos on other channels.  They don't believe it.  But don't you guys get the daily list about what's happening here at Sirius?  No.  You sure?  What is that?  Do you check your email?  I don't even know where my email is. 
[01:43:30]  What's the daily list?  It's the daily hot list about everything that's going on here at Sirius and different shows.  All right, what's on the daily list today?  Do you have yours, Sam?  I don't think they sent one.  Sam, you get one?  You have to get one.  Open the hot list, Sam.  Stop hogging it.  All together.  All the time in your email you should do.  That's the daily list.  The hot list should just be pictures of certain asses of employees.  Come on, guys.  You can fuck this one from 3 to 5 in the trucking channel.  Don't you have your SiriusXM email?  Yeah, I do.  But they don't send me a hot list.  Well, they should. 
[01:44:00]  I know.  I'm like a...  You're also a music personality, too, right?  Right.  So you should be getting that.  I think it's very upset that people aren't reading the daily list.  I'm going to look into that.  It's crazy.  I'm going to talk to the guy who sends that out.  Yeah.  Can you make sure I start getting it?  Yeah, you should get it now.  A guy like you?  Yeah, you're right.  A producer and a radio personality?  A stepper like Sam?  Absolutely.  There's just a lot of things.  Even a newspaper, you know, you don't get it.  No.  Oh, my nerds.  You get a whole bunch of other things, too.  And what's an example of what would be on the hot list?  The Bon Jovi channel, which is happening tomorrow afternoon. 
[01:44:30]  I believe it goes on channel, was it 141 or something?  Yeah, I think so.  At 3 o'clock.  It's a Bon Jovi channel.  It goes everything from his early stuff, from Run, Run Away, right up to the new album.  To the new album, which, yeah, yeah.  How long is it running for?  I believe we have it on for a weekend.  It might be a weekend or a week.  But, again, you see, if you had the hot list in front of you, I don't have mine with me.  We had that hot list.  Well, you weren't prepared to come in here.  No, I wasn't.  Channel 142.  We'll give you a little break.  I was only off my one channel.  You had the hot list.  But that's not bad.  So you keep it on channel 142, and you've got Bon Jovi, because he was here just a couple 
[01:45:00]  of weeks ago.  That's pretty good right there.  And you talk about a guy who's totally involved into his business.  I was working with him once doing an interview at another place that I worked at, and he was  outside on his cell phone talking to a guy about making sure the T-shirts are available.  Wow.  You would think he would have people that do that.  Right, hands-on.  He's got hands-on.  He's like you.  But you know what?  He's only worrying about one band, Bon Jovi band.  You were talking about a gentleman that you worked with years ago and would always listen  to the radio station, wherever he was. 
[01:45:30]  He had radio in the bathroom, radio in the garage, was always attuned to the radio station.  It's very tough to do that in today's climate of broadcasting, because you've got a program  director who's running five radio stations.  True, yes.  How could he listen to all five at once?  He's basically known as a market manager.  Market manager, they're calling him now?  Or he might be the format captain.  Is the radio wizard one of those guys?  The radio wizard?  Yeah.  He probably was one of those guys.  He does more than our channel?  Wow.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Gary's got a lot of things on his plate.  We should lighten this load a little bit.  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  Unfortunately, I'm an arsenic.  I'm sure if you guys called to lunch, I'm sure if you guys said, hey, let's get together  at Applebee's one afternoon and talk things out.  No, that ain't happening.  Applebee's.  They wanted to eat good in the neighborhood?  Danny, I got a real question.  If you're a subscriber of SiriusXM, there's so many different things going on.  Is there a place where the listener or the subscriber could go to see what's going on  on a daily day?  SiriusXM.com.  On a daily basis?  Plus, you get emails.  No, but I mean, is there something on the actual website where you click on it and it's  like, boom, this is all the shit going down today? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, look at the screen.  It's jumping.  It's got everything on there.  Do you read the company emails?  Yeah.  You have to.  Well, I bought, you know, somebody puts these things together.  You should be able to read them.  I literally check them all off and delete them.  Yeah.  I never read anything.  I don't even.  I put them in my spam folder.  I haven't looked at my SiriusXM email.  Ever.  In years.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't even know if I have one.  I don't even know if I have one either.  They use my personal email for, you know, things that are of importance, but things like 
[01:47:00]  the hot list, I should probably get on that.  Yeah, you should.  Yeah.  Physically, you're on it.  Club Soda Kenny had the Studio 54 channel on this morning when he picked me up.  Oh, he did.  That's good.  And I get the visual, how creepy that is.  That's good.  Club Soda Kenny driving in from Jersey, cranking up the Studio 54 channel.  Listening to some old disco.  Have you been checking out the Ultra Music Festival going down in Miami?  No.  No.  Great stuff.  Channel 51, Channel 52.  52. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, it's yeah.  UMF Radio.  It's great.  What is that?  Ultra Music Festival.  All right.  Who's going on there?  It's going on 15, 16 years now.  What is it?  It's all electronic music.  Calvin Harris.  Aren't they all the same song?  Tiesto.  You've got to listen to it, man.  It's great stuff.  Tiesto is there?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Can you give us one song by any of those bands?  Yeah.  I'll give you a little Calvin Harris number.  Pop them up for you.  Oh, sure.  It's a great channel.  And the best is it's commercial free.  So you could just put that thing on.  Oh, wow.  Go all night long with it.  That's pretty good.  Wait a minute.  A little advertisement. 
[01:48:00]  Advertisement is something you're not going to hear on Sirius XM.  It's good, right?  Yeah, very good.  Commercial free music.  That's what it's all about.  It's a little selling point.  You've got a little commercial here for that.  Did you see this movie yet?  What is it breaking this weekend?  Spring Breakers?  Spring Breakers.  Well, let me tell you.  That looks pretty sexy.  Yeah, some teenage titties.  Am I right, Dennis?  They've been having movies like this since the 80s, though.  I mean, there's another movie called Spring Break.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  You didn't answer the question.  Am I right or am I wrong?  You like looking at them teenage titties?  What's that?  You like looking at them? 
[01:48:30]  Oh, what's this?  This is Calvin Harris.  This is a big hit for him.  Feel So Close.  Oh, he's pumping it up here on Sirius XM.  Hits 1.  Right.  Hits 1, UMF radio.  Yeah.  Whatever.  The Ultra Music Fest.  That's some hot stuff, though.  That's why I'm not sharing anything.  All right.  Oh, this starts off a little slower.  I feel So Close to you.  You gotta wait for the kick.  You gotta wait for the kick.  But you gotta get the remix, too.  Sure, of course.  I like this song.  Yeah?  So you know it. 
[01:49:00]  See that?  Yeah, I do know this one.  What type of stuff you're gonna get at the Ultra Music Festival?  I'm just going to solve it.  There's some hot chicks in this.  Bitches.  Yeah.  Oh.  I feel so close to you.  Oh, here it comes.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ready?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There we go. 
[01:49:30]  Just throw your hands up in the air, boy.  Oh, jeez.  Let's get up here.  Yeah.  Get the hands up now.  Come here.  Come on.  Put those hands together.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I was about to see you, like, emceeing a party for, like, the Crips of the Bloods.  He's gonna do one of the hands-off parties this summer.  Oh, yeah.  This summer, you're definitely getting hired at my house.  But he warned you.  You gotta book a head.  I know.  He's very busy.  I have a 75th birthday party coming up this Saturday.  You do.  Are you bringing the hard drive of hits? 
[01:50:00]  Always have the hard drive of hits.  And a backup, too.  What do you play for a 70s?  You gotta remember, you know, back when I started doing this back in the 80s, you'd be playing  music for a 75-year-old person.  You're playing big band and 40s music.  Now it's like, you look at the music list and it's like, you know, Motown.  Oh.  You know, it's all good stuff.  Wow.  Because they're the children of the rock and roll generation.  You ever hear the Dave Rabbit tapes from Vietnam?  Yeah, you've played those before.  That guy's wild.  That guy's pretty wild. 
[01:50:30]  Huh.  Yeah.  He's pretty interesting.  That's something.  Now, how about Jimmy Fallon coming to New York?  You guys excited about that?  Because he's good friends with you, right?  Yeah.  Oh, best of pals.  Is that good for you?  Best of pals, yes.  Well, Jimmy's actually one of the real...  He's a guy that actually said, come on the show.  And he meant it.  Like, Jimmy's a real...  He's a genuinely nice guy.  I love Jay, so I'm very bummed for Jay if they push him out.  But if it has to be anybody, I do like Fallon very much.  And the show's going to be back in New York.  That's what we're hearing.  Yes, bringing the old Tonight Show back to New York.  But NBC denying all this, by the way.  They said they're moving a lot of stuff back to New York, though. 
[01:51:00]  Like, not just potentially that, but other things, yeah.  Jay's been making jokes about this whole controversy.  He's been killing them.  Yeah, this is Monday's joke.  Look at what...  Danny, fuck, material, thank you.  Look at that.  I want to hear your material.  Monday's joke.  Very nice.  Well, you know the whole legend of St. Patrick, right?  St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland, and then they came into the United States  and became NBC executives.  It's a fascinating...  Oh, wow.  That's a nice story.  Ouch.  Well, you remember the movie...  Hold on, Danny.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[01:51:30]  That was Monday's joke.  Now we're up to Tuesday's joke.  Hey, did you hear about this?  28-year-old woman from Serbia has a rare brain condition where she sees everything upside down.  Wow.  The good news, she's now been given a job at the White House as President Obama's economic advisor.  So that's worked out.  It's worked out.  Isn't that crazy?  And unbelievable, she sees everything upside down.  In fact, she thinks NBC is at the top of the ratings. 
[01:52:00]  That's how it's going.  He's getting vicious.  I love the punchline.  I don't go for that stuff, Jay.  I think you ought to be...  Don't make fun of the execs.  No, no, no.  And then this was last night's joke.  This is kind of scary.  Scientists say they're getting closer and closer to being able to do Jurassic Park-style cloning of extinct species.  Imagine that.  Things that were once thought to be extinct could now be brought back from the dead. 
[01:52:30]  So there's hope for NBC.  It could turn around.  It could turn around.  Oh, yeah.  He's taking the old...  If you remember, Letterman and CBS did this.  Hold on.  Let's go to the expert.  We were talking about Danny.  We were talking about Jay.  And do you remember the movie, American Hot Wax?  Yeah.  Yes.  And Jay was in that movie.  Oh, it was NBC.  Sorry.  He played Alan Freed's driver.  That's true.  He was his...  Yes. 
[01:53:00]  But more importantly, he's making fun of NBC, but he's still an employee of NBC.  Is this good?  I don't think he's got anything to worry about.  I don't think anybody's got to pass the hat for Jay if he loses his job.  What's going to happen?  I mean, people like that.  But is that okay?  That's not being a company guy, right?  Yeah.  But, you know, are you gentlemen company guys?  I am.  Okay.  Well, yeah.  So you kind of live on that.  That's why people kind of tune in.  If they kind of...  They tune in for you guys for that.  Sure.  You know, if Cousin Brucie started doing stuff like that, that's not what you go to him for.  They put him in a home. 
[01:53:30]  People, you know, it's like when you go to McDonald's.  Yeah.  You go there because you want that hamburger.  Yeah.  So when they come to Opie and Anthony, they know they're not going to get radio.  That's a little bit...  Exactly.  Oh, no.  That's like Scorch.  They want pizza.  They want pizza.  I'm a hamburger.  I'm a Scorch burger.  I can't think of anyone that's more of a company guy than you.  And look, they don't take care of you.  I got my paycheck every two weeks.  It shows up.  Everything's good.  You should be making more money.  You've got a nice desk.  Computer works.  You should be making more money.  We've got a couple of guys like yourself should make a lot more money. 
[01:54:00]  You should always be making more money.  You're pushing the product constantly.  But, you know, I'm out there.  I'm just hoping the weather gets nicer because I like to get out there and pound the pavement.  A lot of the nice bars around the tri-state area on the water.  No, I go out and knock on the door and say, hey, you guys got a private party room?  Here's my business card.  So, you know, you get out there.  You actually do that?  You're knocking on doors?  Yeah, I did that down in Freeport, which is, if you're not familiar with the area, it's down on the water of South Shore of Long Island.  Hopefully, a lot of those places will be back there this year after the hurricane.  So, hopefully, I'll have a place to bring a business card to. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  You go down there and say, if you guys got a party room and you guys are having something going on, you need a DJ, I'm the guy for you.  Yeah.  Well, like I said, he's the guy for me at one of my parties.  Hurt your feelings when Troy said that you bother him in the bathroom?  No.  That's okay.  You heard that, right?  I heard that, and I didn't agree at all.  Troy, what's wrong with him?  Denny and I have talked in the bathroom many times about the Islanders.  Why would Troy say that?  What a jerk.  He wasn't being very jerky.  He might just be a quiet person.  There are some people, too. 
[01:55:00]  You know, just hello.  I'll be in the men's room, and a song will be playing.  You know, like today, maybe I'll be hearing an Eddie Money song, who happened to be 64 years young today.  What's your favorite Eddie Money song?  I like Two Tickets to Paradise.  That's a good one.  I always like Two Tickets to Paradise.  I like Water.  I like Water.  Water, do you like that one?  Yeah, I do like it.  That's more of an album cut.  I'm more from the hit singles.  It's depressing that he's really sick, though.  Cool, Cool Water.  What?  Two Tickets to Paradise.  Great song.  How do you know? 
[01:55:30]  He and I are very sick.  Who?  Eddie Money.  Why?  What's he got?  Cancer.  What?  Didn't that happen?  I don't know.  It's common knowledge.  No.  It's not true.  I know.  You're acting.  No, I know.  Okay.  And K-Fed is 34 today.  K-Fed?  Who's talking about K-Fed anymore?  Yeah, I know.  He K-Fed himself a pizza right then.  He put on a couple of pounds, didn't he?  Yeah, fat cock sucker.  No, chipper.  Fucking pizza garbage. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, why don't you eat another pile of fucking toenails or something?  Wow.  I see you also have something good today.  The last prisoners were relocated from the prison Alcatraz.  So maybe you'd play something from the classic rock genre, Thin Lizzy, Jailbreak.  Wow.  I see.  You want to wrap that shit up going into break?  And it was 50 years ago today that Alcatraz closed.  Yes.  Let's do this, Danny.  They were relocated.  I don't know if it closed.  Just says they were relocated. 
[01:56:30]  I don't want to speak out of turn.  The prison was closed.  They were fucking closed.  Alcatraz was officially closed 50 years ago.  It says relocated here.  Now you go there as a tourist.  It's a terrific tour.  That's on what it says, Danny.  And there was also the movie with Nicolas Cage.  Remember?  The Rock.  The Rock, yeah.  With a escape or something.  Valley Girl?  No, it wasn't Valley Girl.  Huh?  What's the ramp time on Thin Lizzy's Jailbreak?  Two hours, 28 minutes.  That's a long ramp.  Ramp time, fuck, yeah. 
[01:57:00]  And then you would maybe cross-promote to one of our classic rock channels.  What's your tie-in WrestleMania, The Rock?  Oh, gee.  The Rock, yeah.  He's back into that, right?  He's back into the wrestling thing.  So I guess the movie career didn't really skyrocket the way he wanted it to.  He's got like three movies coming out.  Oh, does he?  Because I see that he's back into the WWE, is it WWF, WWE?  A bunch of Ws.  On the hot ship.  You got Thin Lizzy?  Let's get Danny to do this to break for us.  Yeah, hey, fat Eric, you got Thin Lizzy?  Shut up, Chip.  That's no Chip voice joke right there, Jimmy. 
[01:57:30]  That's a good one.  No, that wasn't Chip because he didn't realize there was actually a clever connection.  Yeah, true.  19 seconds on the...  Oh, and...  19 seconds.  And by the way, Denny, you were wrong.  This fine guy on the Twitter, Cock M Amy, he writes, there's not a today's highlight on  SiriusXM.com.  You have to look at all the channels yourself.  Wouldn't that be really smart?  You have a website and very easily you go, here's everything that's happening today. 
[01:58:00]  Boom.  You click on that and it goes around the channels for you.  Yeah, that would be good.  Maybe you can bring that up at your next luncheon.  Luncheon.  You guys got the ideas, just, you know, bring them out there.  Well, this is basic shit that they should be doing, don't you think, Denny?  Well, sometimes if something is right in front of you, you don't realize that.  All right, talk up Thin Lizzy for us.  You ready for this, Denny?  I'm ready.  Just pump that up in there for me, please.  Well, good morning.  Here it is on the Opie and Anthony show Thursday.  One more day before you can slap yourself on the back and say, hey, you made it to the weekend. 
[01:58:30]  But in the meantime, and in between time, it was back on this day, 1963, when the prisoners  in Alcatraz went bye-bye.  So let's get that jailbreak rocking with Thin Lizzy.  Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak.  Fucking perfect.  Jesus.  So we're in this town.  I will listen to Thin Lizzy.  Thanks, Denny.  Thank you, Iraq.  See, me and the boys, we don't like it.  So we're getting up and going down.  Hiding low, looking right to left.  If you see us coming, I think it's best to move away. 
[01:59:00]  Do you hear what I say from under my breath?  Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak.  Somewhere in the town.  Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak.  So don't you be around.  Don't you be around.

No  I was older than that  Did you pat you on the back  And leave the hand there  A little too long?  No  I was probably like 20  21 maybe  Yeah  Maybe even older  Did he go  You know  Actually he was probably like 24  You ever hear of the Disco Duck  Sam?  That was me  Mr. Deeds  This was a giant hit  By the way Sam  I'm aware of who you are  Mr. Deeds  And um  Yeah  I got a gold record  For this 
[02:04:30]  Now  Rick Deeds  Here's the question  Yeah  What was the follow up to this?  Cause you gotta think  Rick Deeds wanted to be like  Okay I can be a music guy now  I'm gonna have a song  Every once in a while  That is gonna  You know  Be the thing  The hit  So there was Disco Duck  I don't know the answer  Oh  Oh I thought there was another one  Which is the first problem here  But you gotta think  He did try to get something else going  Oh I bet he did  Does anyone know?  E-Rock  Do you know?  What was the song he did after Disco Duck?  Cause you know he had to try 
[02:05:00]  I don't know  I hate that song  Oh  You don't like Disco Duck?  I hate  It was on every set  Here it is  Oh  Let's go  Oh  Chip-a-likes  Yeah  Doug's talking  What's he saying?

[02:05:30]  At about 75%  My mother loved this song  She would always laugh  And flap around  Like a duck  Yeah  Alright Sam found it  I found it  Holy shit  Is this real?  Yes  Don't even say the name  Okay  This we think was the follow up  It was the follow up  It was the follow up  No  So he had success with  Does Denny know?  Is that why he's walking in here?  Oh  Are you walking in uninvited now?  Denny  You wanted the song?  There's a lot of people out there  That are really bummed out  Because they know we're poisoning you 
[02:06:00]  They're like  He's a good company man  Don't do this  Don't poison Denny  Look he's already walking in  When the on-air light's on  He's already moving a hot mic  You were stuck on the song  And that bothers me  When somebody doesn't know the song  Oh  Oh okay  But he did  He walked in with the on-air light  And he grabbed the hot mic  And you know  We're in headphones  And I'm sitting down  And you're sitting down  And I'm sitting  It took a week for us to poison him  It just bothered me  That you didn't  It just got real  Look what  Everything's wrong with your  With what's going on here 
[02:06:30]  No headphones  You're sitting down  You're touching the hot mic again  Don't do that  And you know what  I don't see a clipboard  No clipboard  He walks everywhere  With his clipboard  Just wanted to make sure  That you knew  He's so corrupted already  And Sam is right  He's a real nice guy  Rick Deese  He's a good guy  He's a nice guy  Danny you get us outside this place  We're terrific guys too  Oh yeah  We really are  You'd think we were perfect gentlemen  That's right  It was Disco Gorilla  No no no no  Disco Rilla  Oh Disco Rilla  Excuse me  Disco Duck  Disco Rilla

[02:07:30]  The DJ on duty  The DJ on duty  Never leaves the studio  Jimmy  Unless he has to go to the bathroom  DJ on duty  Do you do this  When you like something  Oh my god  You know who used to do that  Zacherly  Zacherly  I worked with Zacherly once  He was doing a Halloween show  Yeah  And he  It was  He was great  And he gave the sound effect  And he took a bite  Just like Jimmy did  And he said  Oh brains  Ah  Oh  See that  It was like he was  Oh it was Zacherly  He was like a vampire guy  Yeah he was great  Yeah

[02:08:30]  To me  It's Dan  I mean  It's the smoothest  The greatest voice  Dan Ingram  Recognizable voice  Les Marshak  Who used to do mornings  For many years  Was a morning man  On WPIX radio in New York  He went on to  Be the  He did all the commercials  For Macy's  What's Dan Ingram sound like  Dan Ingram  Didn't have a good voice  Come on  Oh he's a great voice  He's a legend  But I think there were  Better voices than Dan Ingram  Don't you think  Dan Ingram  Proud to be with you  We know that of course  Back to 1959 
[02:09:00]  That was 33 years ago  You were one huh  Sure you were  Right  Great voice  Yeah but I  Wow  You know I should shut my fucking mouth  But it's cause  I remember the reverb  Yeah yeah  Well there's a lot of guys  Who had great voices  Dan Ingram had a great voice  That's a good fucking radio voice  Right there  Hooray  Remember  That entered  Your favorite  All the years  Let's hear a little bit of him 
[02:09:30]  1973  Whoa  101  CBS  FM  Who that is?  Hi Archie Lee Brothers  Is that Danny?  Holy shit  Danny's in this video  Oh I like you  That was Danny  He's laughing  He's like  Look at Danny  That's young Danny  That's Danny  Wait what?  His hat's on backwards  And he's got a mustache  Wait that's you?  That's Danny the sex bagel  Did you just pop that up? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah  And you're in this  That's 1992  So that's 20 years ago  Yes I was working with Dan  At CBS FM  You remember that?  Yeah  Yeah it was a Sunday afternoon  Is that a Mets hat?  That's a Mets hat  Of course it is  What a pisser  He just pops up  Is that a fun day?  Oh yeah it was always fun  Dan bought me lunch every Sunday  Oh what a guy  Every Sunday  Good guy too  Good guy  And I was like I'll just have  He goes no get something  Let's get me a roast beef sandwich  Or something  And I would remind him  He would play a song  Hey remember when you said this  Back in 1966 
[02:10:30]  About this song  And he would say oh yeah  And he would remember it  Wow  He was a great guy  What did you do for him?  What's that?  I ran the board  Ran the console  Put the music together  Helped him out  What year was he a DJ?  He came back to New York  1961 I want to say  And worked at CBS FM  Well into I guess  The later part of the 90s  Early part of the 2000s  Is he dead?  No  Dan is still with us  He's in Florida  How old is he?  Dan's got to be in his mid 70s 
[02:11:00]  Late 70s maybe  Let's hear a little of the  That's great  I want to hear a little more Dan  From this right here  I want to hear a good solid talk up  Look at that smile on Danny's face  Oh he's just in paradise right there  Yes he is  He's playing the jingles  Playing the songs  Oh boy you were in radio  Come on  Hi it's Lee brothers  And you're space brothers  Of course  Oh thank you  You're the favorite only song  Make it home  CBS  Oh you got the best music 
[02:11:30]  And the best station  CBS FM 101.1  The number one oldest station  In the entire American thing  You got it baby  Yes  It's hard to say I'm sorry  Which sounds like the only way to make up  Chicago  Yeah Donna Summer  Yeah  Last dance  That's the Cobbler Cotillion  Right here on CBS  Oh that's terrible Dan  I should get out of the business  But I'm greedy  It's eight minutes in front of one o'clock 
[02:12:00]  CBS had been  Have a fun time  And it's a lot of guys  Who have great voices  But they didn't know how to use it  The party songs weekend  Okay  Danny is there  Are you singing along with the jingles?  Singing along with your favorite oldies  Sure  The station you could sing along to  Oh why  Why  You have to make sure those things are programmed properly  You don't want  Why is a guy like Denny rotting here?  I'm not rotting here  You need a good gig  I like working here  You need a good gig  You know what  There's very far  You don't have a full time shift here do you? 
[02:12:30]  But I have a full time worker  I've got a job  Oh god  He doesn't mind being behind the scenes  Why can't they give me a shift?  Well you can have all this passion  It's a show  Remember it's a show  It's not a shift  I'm sorry  It's a show right  This is the opium anthem of a show  It's not the opium anthem of a shift  You're working at a steel mill  You do a shift  There you go  In Allentown  They were closing down the steel mill  Right  Billy Joel  What about Ron Lundy?  Ron Lundy  Ron Lundy  Ron was a nice guy  CBS, FM 
[02:13:00]  Ron had a great voice  Cousin Brucey  Cousin Brucey has a good voice  Cousin Brucey had a quirky voice  He's got a quirky voice  It was quirky  It was very fun  Yeah  Hey my cousins  Hey my cousins  I mean I think Howard Huffman  Has a great voice  Howard Huffman  Great disc jockey voice  I know the name  Where did he work?  He worked at WABC  He worked at WPIX  He's out in California now  Yeah  Is it true Dan Ingram  Cursed on the air when Lennon died?  Whoa  That's not too professional  I don't recall that  Someone's calling and saying that happened  He dropped an N-bomb 
[02:13:30]  I don't recall that  But that happened at night too  So Dan wasn't even on the air  That happened  Well who are we listening to now?  Howard Huffman or something?  Where do you want to go, Danny?  Really fast  Howard's good  I don't know if you could get anything by Howard online  I have some great  I could, you know, again  We should get together and go through air checks, you know  I mean  Would you do that on a Saturday night?  Saturday night?  We used to do that Friday night  Saturday night is where we had a lot of radio promotions then  So we could  Saturday night was for the wives  Friday night was for the girlfriends  Friday night was for listening to air checks  Sunday morning was for committing suicide 
[02:14:00]  No, I mean, it was great  I mean, you'd get a copy of a jingle package  You'd call up these companies and say  Yeah, I'm from, you know, whatever  Some small station  We're thinking of getting a new jingle package  And could you send us this one?  Right  And they would send you that  And it'd be great  A lot of guys would cut up these jingles  And use them on their own station  Whoa, that doesn't sound like it's very ethical  You can't do that  You can't do that  It's copyright infringement  No  What about the guys when they got fired?  They took all their radio IDs with them  They took their carts 
[02:14:30]  They took their carts with all the big celebrities saying  Hey, I'm on Blah Blah's show on this Blah Blah station  But then he wasn't working for the Blah Blah station anymore  So he took his carts  And they cut out the Blah Blah station  People leaving at midnight  With giant fucking crates full of carts and everything like that  Now you leave with one SD card in your pocket  Yeah  And you got everything you've ever done  And usually whenever I've gotten fired  You go back to your desk  And they unplug your phone and your computer  And they have somebody from security to walk you out  They don't want you taking any of their property  They don't want you to throw out typewriters out the window 
[02:15:00]  Yeah  Any of the station's secrets  Well, you have to sign a confidentiality agreement  Oh, boy  So you don't get in trouble for that stuff  But you wouldn't even have to sign one  You would just adhere to it  Because it's the thing to do  That's it  It's admirable  You've got to get him a real show  You need a real show  Okay  If the opportunity ever happens  Who do we talk to?  What else are they doing on the oldies channels?  They know I'm here  They know where to find me  How many guys do they have on the oldies channels?  We're pretty stocked 
[02:15:30]  We're stocked  We're up and down the boards  We've got disc jockeys  Personalities  Air talent  Hosts  Whatever you want to call them  They call them in the BBC  They call them presenters  Oh  We call them presenters  All right  That's kind of odd  Well, we weren't going to have you back in  But you knew that  I'm sorry  I mean, you know  But you knew that Rick Dees was going for a second hit  And it was nice that Sam said he was a nice guy  Because  You know what else is a presenter?  When an orangutan  A female orangutan  Needs sex  Her vagina poofs out  And gets extremely red  And they say she's presenting  Yes 
[02:16:00]  Didn't see that on my prep sheets  But  Sixties on six  Do you ever see a baboon cunt?  Here's Otis Redding  Here's Otis Redding  He's shot on a  As you're talking about baboons  You probably could have just played something by the monkeys  Oh, see  There you go  Mickey Dolenz  And David Cassidy  And Peter Noon  Who does a show here on Sixties on six  Every Saturday afternoon  Five o'clock Eastern time  They're going to be in concert  Out on Long Island  If you guys aren't there  Friday night  Friday night  Yeah, Friday night 
[02:16:30]  Let's say there's a priest scandal  It's a lot of hits between those guys  Let's say there's a priest scandal  And I'll keep it clean  Because you're in the studio  I'm going to give you a little respect  But we know what  You know  Priest scandal  Okay  What record would you choose for that?  A priest scandal?  As you're ramping up the song  And talking about what's in the news  Which is a good old priest scandal  I probably wouldn't be talking about a priest scandal  Because I try to keep things  But what song would you pick?  Let me see  What's the Madonna one there?  What was that one?  Oh  I guess you could play that 
[02:17:00]  At an older station  Well how about  It's my asshole  And I'll cry if I want to  You're probably confusing  With Leslie Gore  It's my party  The leader of my crack  Leslie Gore  The crying teen queen  Of Tenafly, New Jersey  Really?  Is a cock in my bay?  1963  We're so poisoning him  Slowly but surely  I sucked an itsy bitsy teeny weenie  Yellow polka dot bikini 
[02:17:30]  Brian Hyland  Yeah but leave that part out  Brian Hyland  Really?  Yellow  It's a good summer song  The summer song's weak  It's called a novelty song  Novelty  Yeah  Really?  Because Brian had a bunch of hits  Yeah  Name one  Name one  I always like the one  Goodbye for the summer  Oh  That's a great one  So you're gonna  Say goodbye for the summer  For the summer  Brian Hyland  You know that one  It's a good song  Same guy  He also had the joke  The Joker went wild  Every day in a letter 
[02:18:00]  Sealed with a kiss  Sealed with a kiss  So we got to sing  Well I thought that was like the association or something  No  1962  How the fuck is the lyrics of that song in your head?  I don't know  I heard like in the rambler  I know the lyrics of that  He stores the word compassion and empathy  It just amazes me  It's a great one of the  The song you haven't thought of is 20, 25 years  And you know the fucking words to it  Gotta say goodbye  Look at the go-go dances behind them  They look hot 
[02:18:30]  Darling I promise you  Why are there go-go dances to this song?  That's weird  I'll send you all my love  It's just part of the fabric  Every day in a letter  Then I'll drink your piss  It's Jimmy  It's gonna be a cold  Lonely summer  But I'll do the emptiness  I'll send you all my dreams  Every day in a letter 
[02:19:00]  I gotta go higher  Sealed with a kiss  Now that's a good song  See?  A good song  It stands up  It stands up  Over the years  He didn't know this song  I'll hear your voice  Everywhere  I'll run  To tenderly hold you  But darling  You won't be there  I don't wanna say goodbye  For the summer 
[02:19:30]  Yeah  It was the same guy as Itsy Bitsy  Never knew that  I didn't know that either  That's pretty cool  These are sad  Weird songs  Because you know that their youth is so long gone  It's really  50s and 60s music depresses me  Yeah  No it shouldn't  I mean it's good stuff  It's good stuff  It's good stuff  It's America  Music changed  In 1967  When the whole  Hate Ashbery thing  Came into view  The summer of love  Summer of love  The British invasion 
[02:20:00]  That's basically 67, 68, 69  You'll see the change in music  Change in the Beatles albums  A little more psychedelia  A little more  Yeah  That was very innocent  Before that  Back then you'd be saying  Good times  And great oldies  Brian The Highland  1962  Here on the summer songs weekend  Don't forget  We got that Opie and Anthony party pack  That you can win  She was afraid to come out of the lockdown  You knew there was no ramp time on that song  I was as nervous as she could be  I can't believe it's the same guy  That's crazy  The song's hilarious  I always liked his other one  The Joker went wild  That's a good song too  But you could tell she had VD 
[02:20:30]  The Joker went wild  Cesar Romero  Remember the Joker from Batman?  Oh I remember Cesar Romero  There's just so many great tangents  That you can go off on  With all these great songs  Are there  Do you like this song?  No  What's your favorite novelty song of all time?  I guess  I don't know  What'd you call  Kung Fu Fighting  Or Convoy  Sure  Mexican Radio  Wall of Voodoo  Those are  Convoy 
[02:21:00]  Those are absolutely novelty songs  Yeah I guess you'd call those novelty songs  Is that again  What's his name  The guy who had all the cut-in records  As they used to call them  Dickie Goodman  Dickie Goodman  We've done some Dickie Goodman  On this show  What about we?  Well they call it the streak  Look at that  Look at that  Ray Stevens  They have the A-Rab  He let's show off his physique  Yeah  But then again  He had a great song  Ethel  Don't look Ethel  Oh yeah  And then again  He did a great version of Misty  Hold on  Here's Dickie Goodman  Turn  Oh no  This is Ray Stevens  Oh Ray Stevens 
[02:21:30]  I thought you were getting some Vicky  I'm sorry  Dude I played this record to death  You liked this one  I would pretend I was doing it  I wanted to perform it  Oh you did  It's funny yeah  The fruits and vegetables  Naked as a jay  Naked as  Lucy's killing with us  Don't look Ethel  It's too late  She'd already been insane  He comes  Boogie dee boogie dee  There he goes  Boogie dee boogie dee  And he ain't wearing no clothes  And these novelty songs  Novelty songs  You always get the most requests for  Of course 
[02:22:00]  People love the novelty songs  King Tut by Steve Martin  Steve Martin  And yeah  But this was in response  To the big streaking craze  That was going on  Oh yeah  I remember this  The first time I heard this  I was DXing  The Greaseman  He was up on the  1330 WPI  The Greaseman show  We have Dennis  Young Dennis in the studio  You're helping me out  You helped out  I didn't help him out  I remember hearing him  I remember DXing 
[02:22:30]  We used to drive  To the north shore  Of Long Island  So you could hear stations  From Connecticut  What's DXing me?  You had long distance listening  So you could DX his station  Back in the days  Yeah  Yeah we would drive  To like the Verrazano Bridge  So you could listen  To Philadelphia radio  And stuff  Oh my god  Oh my god  Did he at least  Pack some road sodas?  You know what we tried  To do  We used to park  On the bridge  To listen to the radio  You know  We wouldn't pay the toll  You'd sit by the bridge  Yeah  And you'd bring  A cassette machine  So you could make  Some air checks  Of the guys  And you'd listen  Wow listen to this guy  What he's doing  On WFIL 
[02:23:00]  This was called DXing  Yeah you'd listen  This guy is radio  Well DXing is because  Back in the day  Of AM radio  Did you enjoy  Did you enjoy  A good FM skip  Weren't they called  Skip or something?  Yeah sometimes  You'd be in the middle  Of Long Island  And you'd hear a station  You know from  It would skip off the water  Or something  Something coming in  From far away lawns  I worked at a radio station  That was directional  It was an AM station  And we were powered down  At night  And the pattern would change  And then it would hit the water  And they'd pick us up  In Bermuda  Wow  You couldn't hear us  In Lindenhurst 
[02:23:30]  Damn  Yeah you'd hear us  In Bermuda  When we were at  AAF there  Dennis  On the north shore  Of Long Island  We could actually  Pick up AAF  From Worcester  Massachusetts  When we came home  For the weekends  Yeah sometimes  You'd have the  Atmospheric skips  Like you'll see that  If you have satellite TV  That and the old days  When Wolfman Jack  Would broadcast  From those  100,000 watt  Stations  In Mexico  Oh wow  That's what a genius  I'm on a Mexican radio  They'd put them  Over there 
[02:24:00]  And just like  Fucking broadcast  If a bird flew  By the tower  He would barbecue  It was just like  A crazy power  How far does that go?  Wolfman Jack's radio  This would cover  The midwest  It was crazy  100,000 watt  Like you said  The station  The skip would go  Into Mexico  And Texas  All over  Texas radio  The big beat  There you go  Ah the Wolfman  Why did the Wolfman  Appeal to people?

[02:29:00]  Sam Roberts piece of shit show  What?  I think it's called that  And I heard your exchange  With the wonderful Dennis here  Yeah  And I was a little taken aback  At the viciousness  That came out of you  As you're talking about  Pretty much a co-DJ  Kind of guy  And it sounded a little  Petty  Of you  Troy explain  Explain where that was coming from  Well Denny's a cool guy  I mean he's fine  I would have known  From what I heard from you  But he just  He's one of those radio guys  That just  They  Just  Constantly has to yap 
[02:29:30]  You know what I mean  Like  Yeah  Radio guys think that  They're always on  Like if you go in the bathroom  With like the  The sports guys  Uh huh  They think they're on the radio  Right then  Well maybe the echo  Gets them all like excited  They're like all excited  Good ambience  Yeah  And you're talking  They're like  Did you see the game  Blah blah blah blah blah  And they're standing at the urinal  And the other guy's like  Well  Same voice  Yeah  And you're just like  And I love when I see those guys in there  Because I'll say something like  Hey so do you think  You know Jeter's gonna be on the DL  And they'll just go off  And they'll give you everything  There's a show going on

[02:30:30]  They'll walk in the office  They have the earbuds  And I can't say  Good morning  How are you today  Yeah well maybe he's listening  To their own hard driver hits  Maybe possibly  Yeah yeah  You're not the only one  With a hard drive of hits  I respect that  I respect that  Yeah that's right  Denny's one of those guys  That just loves the  Talking about  Reminiscing about the old glory days  Oh yeah  And constantly  He was part of it  Like I'll be standing there  And I'll just be taking a leak  And he'll be like  You know back in the day  On WLJ  And you're just like  Looking over like  What  We're enjoying it right now  But how long do you think 
[02:31:00]  It's gonna take before  We're sick of it  Because it's all new to us  Right now  Yeah  On air  It sounds great  It's funny  He's a character  But off the air  It's just like  Alright dude  Like  You know  I'm trying to take a leak  Do you know how we learn  From people's experiences  In life  You know  You can watch as many movies  Read as many books  As you want  About World War II  But if you sit down  With a veteran  Who was there  You're gonna learn more  That's like you going  Oh god  The guy's talking about the war  It's like  But he was there  Dennis is a veteran 
[02:31:30]  Of the glory days  Of Boss Jock Radio  And you know  You're blowing him off  Like he's just some  Fucking intern  Yeah  Babbling about getting  Someone coffee  That's great  He's a veteran  Of the thousand psychic wars  Exactly  And I'm sure  There's somebody  That cares about it  You know what to do  Just keep me  Fucking  I understand what he's saying  Keep me in the  Oh wow category  Like once in a while  It's like you don't want  To hear Dickie Goodman  Records every day  Right  You hear one every  You know  36, 72 hours  That's right  Do you enjoy 
[02:32:00]  A good Dickie Goodman record  I don't know who the hell it is  Play some Dickie Goodman  For Troy  Oh no  I think you would enjoy this  He doesn't have his headphones  Hold on  Being like a creative guy  And you go in your studio  Produce stuff  You can learn a little something  From Dickie Goodman  This guy was the king  You ready for this Troy  Yeah  Production  Alright play the hit  He repurposed  He repurposed songs  What's the hit one  There's the Jaws one  Mr. Jaws  Flying saucer  Mr. Jaws  You like the movie Jaws right  Sure  It's a classic  Look what Dickie Goodman  Did with it  Exactly  And he finally 
[02:32:30]  In the end  Things worked out  He killed himself right  He shot himself in the head  He couldn't take it  You know what  If you can't find it  Come by my desk Troy  And we can play him for you  Oh wow  I believe you  I'll look at the hard drive  Danny did not care  For my Dickie Goodman crack  At all  No  No  No  That's very sad  You don't have it  E  I'm looking for it  E-Rock  It's gotta be in there  It's probably  Probably on the old YouTube  What are you looking  The old YouTube  E-Rock  Alright  Listen to this  Troy you can learn a thing  Or two from this  Oh boy 
[02:33:00]  We are here on the beach  Where a giant shark  Has just eaten  A girl's swimmer  Well Mr. Jaws  How was it  And what did she say  When you grabbed her  Please Mr. Please  I know sharks are stupid  But what did you think  When you took that first bite  How sweet it is  Mr. Jaws  Before you swim out to sea  Have you anything else to say  I can't breathe in breath  I can't breathe in breath 
[02:33:30]  With me now  Is the local sheriff  Sheriff Brody  The shark will be back for lunch  What do you intend to do  Do a little dance  Make a little love  It's out of the night  Just arriving  Is oceanographer Matt Hooper  Sir  If someone is attacked  By a shark  What should they do  Do the hustle  We are going aboard  The fishing boat  Of Captain Quint  Why  Captain  Will you be able  To catch this giant shark  This is so duisy 
[02:34:00]  Captain  Captain  Yeah but back then  Captain  It's just great stuff  It's just archaic  They're repurposing  It's great stuff  It was funny at the time  People liked it  He had a career  Making these  Cutting records  As they were called  And now it's just archaic  Historic  It's over  Historic  Are you trying to tell  Denny it's over  It's over  It's over  That's why we have  These great radio channels  That bring back music  Like 60's on 6 
[02:34:30]  50's on 5  60's on 6  70's on 7  The decades  The decades channels  Oh yeah  Troy you want to tell him  A thing or two  No I understand  What he's saying  But next time I see him  In the mansion  I'll just give him a nod  And I won't  Let's reference the song  Are you hurting your feelings  No  No  A little bit  He just loves it  He loves the talk  I mean if you watch him  When the door opens  Behind him  He literally goes like this  Like  Who can I talk to  I'll tell you Troy  Could you imagine 
[02:35:00]  What it would be like  To wake up every morning  And have a love  And passion  For what you do  Like Dennis does  That is the ultimate gig  Right  I do love what I do  Of course  And it shows  And then you got  Someone like Troy  Shows on what  He doesn't even have  A fucking show  The company  What do you get  My show  The way he carries himself  You know what though  With that attitude  He will  He's been here 10 years  Can you imagine  What is going to happen  Can you imagine  A program director 
[02:35:30]  Holy fuck  What do you have to do  Around here  To be taken care of  This guy is the  Ultimate company guy  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  I'm like  Right  Right  Yeah  But he's cool  He's cool  With that though  He's alright  Can you imagine  A program director  Trying to deal with him  Like can you imagine  What that would be like  Because this guy  He thinks he knows  Everything about radio  He kind of does  He's been there  So a guy sitting down  And you're like  Hey you know  You should probably do  Well you know  Back in the day  You know  We did it like this  And this is  You know  So and so did it  Like this  What you say  That's a great idea 
[02:36:00]  But you know  This is the way  I heard it  At KMPC  You think it would be  Like about Schmidt  When about Schmidt  Goes into that meeting  And tries to tell people  How to do the work  And they're like  Yeah okay  Yeah yeah yeah  And they just throw  All of his files  No  You know  You have access  To all my files  That I've accumulated  Over my entire life  To teach you  How to do this job  Now that I'm retiring  And the young guy  Steps in  And then they go out  Back  And he sees all of his  Files in the dumpster  Are you saying  Dan Ingram's  Hard drive  Hits was in a dumpster  Somewhere  Troy is exactly right 
[02:36:30]  Because you know  The guys that are  Hiring people these days  They're young guys  You have to deal  With young guys  When you have more  Experience  You can't go in there  And say no  You can't do it  Say okay  A lot of guys  Didn't want to work  With automation systems  When they came around  Can I ask you something  Go ahead  How are you going to do it  How am I going to do what  Car in front of a train  Oh god  Sitting in the garage  With the car on  Oh my god  No  When that day comes  Are you going to  Really make it hurt 
[02:37:00]  Or are you going to  Fade away slow  No  Are you going to  Fucking maybe  Go for the hanging  No you don't want  To do that  That would be great  He's got an answer  To this real young  PD  And you just learn  How to like  Skateboard in  With your hat on  Sideways  Hey boss  You're all just  Hey I'm just a kid  Coming in  When I do go to  Rock and roll heaven  When that day comes  I always want the  Coffin to be open  And say Dennis  Couldn't make it  He had a gig  Wow  That's pretty good  I'd like to have  Something recorded  Like hey this is  Dennis thanks for  Coming to the wake  It'd be good to 
[02:37:30]  When the casket's  Closed have two  Turntables on it  And someone DJing  From your casket  Yeah  Not a microphone  Or how about  You're on your  Stomach with your  Pants down and  There's a record  Placed in between  Your ass  No I'd like to  Go in a tuxedo  I'd like to have  A tuxedo  Yeah yeah yeah  You married  Married man  Oh your kids  How old  Three children  Older  21  18 and 16  Wow  You're in hell  Yeah  That's crazy  They're cool  My son and I  Last night were  Listening to the  Ultra Music Festival  On the radio  Does he like the 
[02:38:00]  Old stuff or the  New stuff  He likes it both  He'll say hey  I heard this song  By Van Halen  Or something  Is he the 16  Or 21  The 16  Oh okay  That's a big  Difference  He's still at that  Age where dad  Is okay  You know  And then 18  That's for most  At 16  But it's marginal  At 16  They start coming  Back around  At 21 I bet  Yeah but  Yeah but he's  Pretty cool  Like next year  The year after  That and stuff  You'll just be  A piece of shit  Like last night  I took him to a show  Out at Night of the  Living Dead or something  One of the groups  That were playing  On Jose's channel  On Boneyard  Or something  They were out at 
[02:38:30]  The Paramount  Out on Long Island  Oh  That was one of those  They went there  Yeah  I dropped them off  They were in four  Very hard  You should have went to  F.H. Riley's  And had a few beers  Well I had to drive  Yeah see  He's not going to  Drive drunk  Who's looking though  And that's you know  Because my son  Is learning how to drive  He's got to know  Where the roadblocks are  You can't show him  Things like that  So you took him  To the metal  What was the band  As I lay dying  Or something  Oh yeah  Oh there you go  Oh look at that  A couple of those  That's like a Christian  Metal band  Wow you guys got something  That you can talk about  Yeah  And as a dad 
[02:39:00]  I'll never say  You know that music  Is garbage  You got to put  No because every genre  Every generation  Has got their music  Ah look  He's willing to accept it  That's good  He's got an open mind  It might not be  Exactly my thing  I mean  Right  Today's hip hop  Maybe not your bag  Exactly  But you know what  You can't say  It's not good to someone  No  He likes you  You like that music  You know I might still  Like listening to  The Sugar Hill Gang  Do you respect  The open mindedness  Troy  Sure  You have to  Oh yeah  You know he's  He definitely stays up  On his music  So I mean  You have to  You don't want to be  A dinosaur  I know  Oh no no 
[02:39:30]  All right  By the way  Everybody wants  The dinosaur  Oh I like  Was not was  Was not was  Don was  He knows  He keeps up  With his music  He knows  That's a new song  For him  Let's keep it up  With him  All right  Well this was terrific  I think we got  Something done here  Let's go to the  Men's room  And I won't talk  To you  Okay  Hey just a simple  Hey how you doing  We were gonna listen  To Disco Rilla too  But I didn't want  To miss that  Because this all started  We knew the Disco Duck  Disco Duck  And we were thinking  Rick D's  That song was so huge  It was on  It was on prime time 
[02:40:00]  I mean they played it  Everywhere  Number one song  And we were thinking  Rick D's must have  Tried to get another  Hit going  Yeah  And this thing  Just fucking  Failed miserably  Right  I don't remember  Disco Rilla  I don't remember  This at all  I don't even remember  The name of this  Disco Duck  We didn't play this one  Disco Duck by the way  On the Saturday Night  Fever soundtrack  Yes  Wow why would they  Do that  It was playing  In the club  It was that part  In the dance studio  Why would they  Then say let's get  This on  I guess  It was in  Every song  It was in the  Practice studio  It was in the movie 
[02:40:30]  Did they bury it  At least at the end  Of the soundtrack  I don't believe  It's on the  I don't know  If it made the  Soundtrack  I don't think  It made the soundtrack  It was in the movie  You're scaring me  I don't think  It made the soundtrack  Oh I thought  It was  I thought every song  In the movie  Was on the soundtrack  I don't believe  That one was  Oh my goodness  By the way  I'm sure Rick D's  Wishes it was  Oh I bet  Good question  Better hard drive of hits  Denny or Gary Glitter  Somebody asked that  Rock and roll part two  Oh you're  Rock and roll part two  And he also had the original 
[02:41:00]  Do you want to touch  Which was later done by  Joan Jett  Well yeah  Touch it  Do you want to touch  No Disco Duck  On the album  I didn't think so  Wow  It was being played  It was being played  In the disco  It was being played  In the rehearsal studio  Where they were dancing  Finally we get to  Rick D's  The follow up to  Disco Duck  This is  I'm the Disco  Gorilla  Let's hear this  What's this  Solid gold  This was on 
[02:41:30]  Solid gold  Oh boy  What's that  What's that  What's that  Oh my god  Oh my god  Go ahead  Oh this is so doozy 
[02:42:00]  Why are they clapping  It's disco  It's disco 
[02:42:30]  Yeah it didn't work for me  It's disco  This is so embarrassingly bad.  This is horrendous.  It's trying to do the same thing as Disco Duck with Disco-Rilla.  I like the chimp sound. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, so do I.  What do you think the third animal was going to be?  I know.  He was going to go for the trilogy, wasn't he?  Disco shotgun.  He wanted it to be like his little thing.  Yeah, he was thinking I'm just going to go through all the animals.  Disco cat.  Meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  A Disco-Rilla.  I hate that part the most.  I hate that.  That's so bad.  He's making like gorilla noises. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, he sure is.  That's great.  All right, Danny.  All right, gentlemen.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye, Dennis.  Have a blast.  Want to kill this mic?  Huh?  Kill this mic?  You want me to work?  Kill this mic?  You don't like that part?  What?  I hate that part.  God, it's so bad.  I don't want to just walk away from a hot mic.  Oh, no, no, no.  There you go.  Here it is.  Look, he opens the door very carefully as to not make any noise.  He doesn't want any door noises.  No door noises.  Oh, shit.  He is great.  You know how many times you hear that door slam during our show? 
[02:44:00]  Who cares?  Now when Danny walks in.  What is this?  Bigfoot?  This is the follow-up to Disco Real.  No, you're lying.  You got to follow the Disco Real.  Why do you follow up a song that didn't work?  All right.  By the way, it's DennisFalcone.com.  Yeah.  That guy should get a fucking...  I feel...  I feel like shit.  That guy...  I'm not even fucking going to front.  The guy should be like...  He's a major company man.  Take care of the guy.  Maybe they are. 
[02:44:30]  Maybe he's making six figures.  Hey, who knows?  Fucking shit.  You see how he dresses?  Eight million a year.  Oh, my God.  Iraq, comment.  We put up a nice little gallery of Denny photos up on our Facebook.  Oh, okay.  Iraq, I know it's a surprise, but why don't we just announce what we're doing with Denny?  Okay.  Yeah, that shouldn't be a surprise.  I don't think it should be a surprise.  It wasn't a surprise.  We were just waiting for permission.  Oh.  We had to ask for permission to do that?  What?  From who?  From his boss.  Denny's boss.  Oh, wow.  Makes sense.  Fair enough.  What's going on?  He's going to host the worst of the week this weekend. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  Give him a little gig.  Also known as Iraq doesn't want to do that shit anymore.  You should have seen...  Iraq's had it.  You should have seen Iraq and all his laziness masking it to be like his idea.  Uh-huh.  He's sitting there pitching it in our meeting, and he goes, yeah, Denny's going to host it,  and I mean, I'm not going to write anything.  I'm not going to show him how it's done.  I'm not showing up.  I'm not doing anything.  It would be way funnier.  Just let him go. 
[02:45:30]  I applaud Iraq.  He figured out the way to...  I mean, he emphasized the fact that he would...  I'm not going to do anything just so Denny can shine.  Right.  What a guy.  That's very nice of him.  He should do it a couple weeks in a row.  I think people would enjoy that, and then we'll tap out of it for a little bit.  Disco.  What do you think?  Sure, why not?  Is he going to do the whole clipboard thing and get all sorts of fucking cross-promotion?  You should probably commit to one before we commit to a bunch.  All right.  I was just looking at Jimmy.  Jesus, Jimmy, you're thin.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Holy fuck. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, Jimmy's slendered down to like a little weight.  How much weight did you end up losing?  I don't know.  This shirt's just small.  Aw.  No.  It's just small.  Jimmy's all slender.  I don't know.  I probably lost 25 pounds.  God bless you.  DennisValcone.com.  What is he doing in the woods with a microphone?  What is that?  What is he doing?  What is that?  I'm obsessed with this guy.  I am, too.  Can't help it.  We've got to be careful because we can easily burn him out, but I'm just obsessed with Dennis  Valcone. 
[02:46:30]  He's a man with all the information.  Yeah.  More than ever.  And they don't give a fuck about it.  Did you ever go DXing fucking shows from bridges?  I would stumble upon DXing.  You know what?  I wish I took it to the next level like he did because that was kind of cool when a radio  station came in that you never heard before because they were doing different things.  Now it doesn't matter.  Every fucking format does the same fucking shit.  Dennis's glamour shots are great.  Oh, yeah.  He's a great shot.  He looks like he's got a home studio. 
[02:47:00]  Look at that.  Hey, how you doing?  Dennis Valcone.  How you doing?  He's got that little smile.  His head's tilted forward a little.  Oh, hey.  Snapping his fingers.  No, he's got one hand snapping, the other one pointing.  Yeah, pointing a microphone.  He's like, doing a gig.  Hey.  Oh, he's promoting us on his Facebook.  Thank you, Dennis.  There he is.  Yeah, behind the board.  Holding the mic.  We're at a tie.  Gentlemen.  DJing.  Dennis Valcone is everything you need to know about SiriusXM.  Yeah.  A real company guy that really knows this shit.  And he has a clipboard just waiting for them to call him. 
[02:47:30]  Everyone loves him.  Call him in from the fucking bullpen.  All the feedback I'm getting right here in front of me, everyone loves Dennis.  Everybody loves Dennis on this show.  Would everybody love if we hadn't introduced him in this way, just listening to him?  Ah, sure.  Yeah, we wouldn't move on him, right?  He's the guy we talked about off and on for years.  He was the guy that used to bother me every day about the Islanders.  Right.  Every day.  It was something about the Islanders.  You'd call it bothering you, Opie?  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  You wouldn't call it, you know, talking?  No, I've turned the corner with Dennis, though.  I like him a lot.  He does this whistle thing.  Why does he...  Oh, it's our Facebook.  Oh, you scared me.  Because why is there, like, a picture of...  That's my ex from college on our Facebook page.  Yeah.  Oh, and Jim Chandler, who's still blowing me off sad.  Yes, girl.  Very sad.  Dennis does this whistle thing that drives everyone in the office nuts.  What is it?  Because people don't...  He does, like, this weird bird call whistle.  Right.  And everybody who sits around him hates it and won't tell him. 
[02:48:30]  What is it?  Why wouldn't he do it for our show?  I don't know.  He just walks around going, like, I can't do it.  He does this weird...  Is he trying to take on Steve the Whistler?  I don't know.  It's this quick little thing that he does when he walks or when he looks at somebody, and  everybody that sits around him hates it and won't tell him.  Yeah?  They hate it?  They hate it.  Hate it.  People don't like him.  Because he does the whistle thing.  That's all people know of him.  He's a weirdo who does that whistle thing.  Mike, could we hear quickly the follow-up to Disco-Rilla? 
[02:49:00]  This is called Bigfoot by Rick Dees.  He just wanted that next hit.  Oh, he needed the next big hit.  He noticed Disco-Rilla wasn't doing it.  He didn't want to be in the one-hit-wonder category.  Got right back in the studio.  Say hi to Dexie's Midnight Run or whatever the fuck.  Come on, Eileen.  That was it for them.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see. 
[02:49:30]  Ah, okay?  Okay?  Backwards of Oregon  I saw a shadow of a 10 feet long  Was down a road behind a tree  You'll see me, see him, see me 
[02:50:00]  You know, there's that little groovy voice  Yeah, and the dumb chorus  Yeah, and the chorus always sounds like Disco Duck  I'm waiting for the chorus because it's going to sound just like Disco Duck  Bigfoot, Bigfoot, Duck  That's really bad  Wow  did he follow that song up  not for another six years 
[02:50:30]  I don't know if that counts as a follow up  but he did  Bigfoot  what was the song  Bigfoot dance  just to go down the hot 100  I think if I remember correctly  then he reworked Disco Duck  oh did he  I think he finally went back to his  his original song  and tried to like rework it or something  Disco Duck was fucking awful  terrible  Disco Duck peaked at number one  I know  Disco Rilla peaked at number 56  Bigfoot peaked at 110  oh no  oh no  sliding down the chart 
[02:51:00]  and then six years later  what did he come up with  get  get naked  get naked  get naked  do we have audio  look at his dumb dance  it's all  yeah  let's get  let's get naked  when life gets you down  no matter what state or time  his greatest you're around 
[02:51:30]  get naked  mmm  Adams that's too easy  you don't need to wear those leaves  it's ripping off Ghostbusters  yeah  Ghostbusters  wait a minute  I think we just figured out  where Scorch got his whole radio deal from  hey  get naked  what  Adam and  where did this peak at  yeah  this peaked at number 104

[02:57:00]  I guess you're in California  or  exactly  I'm ready to go  or in the Andes Mountains  Ben are you a stand up  or just a sketch  just sketch  yeah I never really did the stand up thing  I  I  I watch stand ups  and I realize I can't fucking do that  good sketch is fucking hard  like  you do improv  I don't really do  I try again  I tried improv  and I sucked at that too  so I'm  there's not too much I'm good at  so  well you're good at sketches  wait you're the George Clooney guy 
[02:57:30]  I just realized  oh yeah yeah  no you  I was the guy  I was the guy who messes everyone on Twitter  yeah I was gonna say  you're  alright  okay  alright I know  I'm just learning about you  but yeah  Ben Hoffman fucks with people on Twitter  from time to time  it's hilarious  I do it  I do it all the time  okay you've just decided  that's what Twitter is good for right  yeah basically  every  every time I'm like on radio  or on a talk show  or something  I'll give people my Twitter  my Twitter's at the Ben show 
[02:58:00]  and I'll give them my Twitter  and I'll just answer everyone  and just mess with people all the time  so  I really have no life  explain the Obama  Clooney thing  that was  that was a really good one  that got you some  pretty good press  yeah no I went  you guys remember  when Clooney had this big fundraiser  for Obama  oh yeah  like  six months ago  yeah  and I pretended like I was there  because press couldn't get in  right  I started tweeting  as if I was at the thing 
[02:58:30]  and I started talking  well the first thing that got noticed  is I tweeted out  to people  I go  you know  Obama's getting ready to speak  Obama points that  George Clooney  and says  man George has more pull  than John Travolta  at a massage parlor  yes  and then  news organizations  like pick that up  seriously  like there's a news  it's ridiculous  yeah  and I  and I actually tweeted 
[02:59:00]  like you know  I find that offensive  but you know  he's the president  it's not really for me to say  whatever  then I spent the whole time  like talking about  how there's all these celebrities  but I spent the whole time  hanging out with Billy Gibbons  from ZZ Top  so all these news reports  came out  like you know  every A-list star is there  but this guy Ben  was only interested  in Billy Gibbons  from ZZ Top  not knowing  not knowing of course  that like  who  would be at this party  hanging out  I spent the whole time  trying to get Billy Gibbons  a ride home 
[02:59:30]  pretending like I wasn't  right  and I'm like  the secret service  is trying to delete  my tweets  but I don't know  how to delete them  like I was tweeting out  like does anyone know  how to delete a tweet  and people believe this  and then I googled out  I googled out  I just googled  I googled  worst cell phone  and it came up  Samsung NAC flip phone  so I go  I have a Samsung NAC flip phone  does anyone  flip phone  does anyone know  how to delete a tweet  on a Samsung NAC  and that just gets 
[03:00:00]  people going  that's great  phone sucks dude  your phone stinks  exactly  they're like  you're at the biggest  A-list party of the year  and you got a Samsung NAC  yeah there's certain  Keith words  and things you could  do on Twitter  that just gets  everyone fucking going  yeah you did  you did some  with Justin Bieber too  we're going to talk  about the Comedy Central  show in a second here  but I love that  I love people  that fuck with people  on Twitter  this was a brilliant bit  yeah absolutely  you posted a photo  of Justin Bieber 
[03:00:30]  on a plane  and claimed he was  sitting next to you  and that Justin  agreed to a Q&A  with fans  through your account  that's a good one  I gotta say  that was the meanest  one I did  who cares if they're mean  I know  but these were little kids  yeah like  people  I pretended I was  doing a live Q&A  with Justin Bieber  yeah  and kids were like  writing me  from across the globe  and they were  you know like  the one I mentioned  on Conan recently  this girl 
[03:01:00]  tweets me  she's like  ask Bieber  if he likes  girls with glasses  she's like 11  I write back  like  I feel bad  but he says  he doesn't  I put a frowny face  and like  ask Bieber  if he's ever  coming to New Zealand  and I'm like  you know  he says New Zealand  fucking sucks  and he's never going  just ruining  these kids lives  I did it 
[03:01:30]  for like an hour  I really felt bad  about that one  but I couldn't  stop  basically I'm sitting  at home on my laptop  on my couch  just cracking myself up  he said New Zealand  fucking sucks  what a funny thing  to say  little girls  hanging on themselves  yeah  but like  first of all  that Justin Bieber  would do it  through his account  yeah  some guy in a plane  like yeah  exactly  and also the idea  that for all I know 
[03:02:00]  he was playing New Zealand  that night  I have no idea  that is very funny  now of course  the Ben show  on Comedy Central  Thursdays  10pm  what's  what's  what's this  oh it's tonight  yes  what's going on  on the Ben show  well it's like  it's like a  sketch show  mixed with  man on the street  stuff  so you get to see me  in my real life  and in between that  you see you know  sketches  it's pretty fucking 
[03:02:30]  crazy  they had a sneak  peek last night  and I  I just got  non-stop  you know  comments about  like  how the fuck  is this airing  on TV  it's so disgusting  like  in a positive way  like how are they  getting away with it  yeah  it's so dirty  and crazy  but  it's a  I was about to say  it's a funny show  but I'm not convinced  of that yet  so I don't know  yeah it's always  hard when you're  promoting your own  thing to say that  but obviously it is  if they're going air  because Comedy Central  is not afraid  to shoot something 
[03:03:00]  and then not use it  believe me  they'll fucking  they pick up like  one out of every  ten pilots  so if they pick yours up  it must be good  that's pretty good  yeah well again  I'm not the kind of guy  who says whether or not  I'm funny  I'm not a big  Ben Hoffman fan  myself  but other people  seem to like it  so  yeah  and do you have like  do you have guest stars on  or do you have like  a regular cast  well it's mainly me  but I mean  we have like  we get the most random  well Norm is on it  occasionally  Norm MacDonald 
[03:03:30]  I know him from the old  I used to write on his  sports show  and he comes out  like Norm  the funniest guy ever  I have him on  and completely waste his  talents on these  like Norm parody movies  what was the last one  we did  we did Transnormers  and we do Transformers  with Norm in it  Norm rules  yeah he's the worst  guy ever  and we have Todd Bridges  you know  it's just like  it's like  just the worst guest  we could find  did you conceptualize 
[03:04:00]  the show  or did you  shoot something  and show it to them  yeah no  this is kind of me  this guy Mike Gibbons  who co-created  Tosh  me and him  kind of had this  crazy idea  for a show  and we were like  let's fucking do  I mean there's no way  they'll air this  but let's just make  a pilot anyway  and they gave us  money to make a pilot  and then we've got  the call  they're going to  pick it up  and we're like  oh man  now we've got to  make the show  now it's work time  yeah you had fucking  five sketches  now you've got to  come up with the  whole season  how many  how many did you  shoot  we have eight 
[03:04:30]  and we  episode four  and episode four  airs tonight  during March Madness  which I don't think  will be much  competition right  I don't watch  that crap  yeah  there's a lot  of people who don't  brackets  what do you want  after  we're actually  it's kind of cool  it's kind of a new  night of new comedians  they're doing on Comedy Central  it's me and this show  Nathan for you  after us  which is really funny  so it's like  we're on after a  it's a Tosh rerun 
[03:05:00]  so it's like a new night  we're both  two new shows  on a new night  trying to get  people in to  you know  get some new comedians  on the air  and they're both  I know his show's funny  like I said  I don't think I'm funny  but other people  people disagree  Tosh draws some people in  oh boy  he's fucking  he really  that show's hot  they didn't think  after Chappelle left  it was like  who's going to be  kind of the face  of the network  and they found Tosh  and his show's probably  a lot cheaper  to make than Dave's was  oh dude  Tosh is so huge 
[03:05:30]  I mean like  the reruns  are like  huge  are huge  it's crazy  people love that show  so yeah  I mean you never know  because like  you know  like Chappelle  didn't even really  take off  until reruns  started airing  so it's weird  you never know  yeah  so far the response  has been pretty good  well and Jeslen's  got a show on  and Nick Kroll  is doing a show  I don't know  what night his show  is on  his first season  just ended  yeah and Anthony's  show's doing really well  I liked Nick Kroll's show  I saw that  yeah I definitely  liked it  yeah it's good 
[03:06:00]  it's like  you know  Comedy Central's been cool  they're giving like  young  you know  it's about time  some of these  young white comedians  you know  get a break  exactly  yeah Amy's  going to be  on there too  Amy's in April right  oh I love  I love  I love Amy  yeah she  I think her show  starts airing  next month  I think  right  yeah  everyone's kind of  picking that  to be very successful  I think you will too  from what I  the scripts I read  well  of course  I am featured 
[03:06:30]  in one of the  sketches  so of course  it's going to be great  yeah well  I was in the pilot  so without me  there is no show  oh Jesus Jimmy  yeah her show  is supposed to be  very very good  yeah it is good  that like you said  young white  I was doing  I was doing  the Joe Rogan  podcast last night  and he said  oh yeah  just tell  tell you guys  hi  yeah Joe  rolls man  was he still  fielding shit  about the  transgender  fighter  you know  I stuck up  for him about  that because  I did  I  it was  it was a  it was a 
[03:07:00]  BS thing  that they were  yeah  what he said  wasn't bad  at all  not at all  like it  I told him  to his face  I go listen  if you said  something bad  about the  transgender community  I would let you know  but you didn't  yeah  it was BS  I hate that we even  have to say  transgender community  I know  I just like  it used to just be  hey you know  some trannies got pissed  and that was good enough  that's why I'm saying that  yeah  exactly  so trannies don't get pissed  to get his back 
[03:07:30]  to be overly PC  right  that way  it doesn't help  if I get on the air  and get his back  I act like a dumbass  but  right  all he was saying  is guys shouldn't  beat up women  basically  yeah  men should not be  in a ring  with women  no matter if they  have a penis  or not  absolutely  exactly  that doesn't seem  like a controversial  statement to me  apparently it is  these days  I don't know  the lovely and talented  Ben Hoffman  thank you sir  the Ben Show  on Comedy Central  tonight  10 o'clock tonight  and he's the Ben Show

[03:09:00]  and things  going on  and yeah  it's just great  it infuriates  people  and he had  one the other  day Goodfellas  and Starbucks  and some of  the fucking  the really funny  ones are usually  like the fans  yeah the fans  come up with  great shit  and somebody  would they just  take these random  quotes and one  of them wrote  in you know  Karen I'm going  out not without  your Starbucks  for award cards  you're not  and I laughed  for 40 minutes  that's a good one  oh my god  there's so many

[03:22:30]  see ya  alright bye  yeah the Nathan show  after Ben  that is fucking hilarious  it's interesting  that Comedy Central  is taking some chances  like first  I thought that  I guess they're not chances  because they've seen  the pilots and all that  but I was under the impression  that it was just gonna be  you know the roast  and then the comedians  that are really successful  at the roast  Amy Schumer  Anthony Jeselnik  will go on to get shows  but guys who I've never  I've never heard of Ben Hoffman  or who's on after him  Nathan  this guy  it's  do you know his last name  I forgot his last name 
[03:23:00]  but it's like  he's fucking hysterical  it's guys that we've never  heard of  that are now getting  these big  these big Comedy Central  shows  but Roland's been  all about Ben Hoffman  and the Ben show  for this whole week  a lot of us  were not terribly  familiar with it  but Roland  is it Nathan Fielder?  is that it  Nathan Fielder?  yeah yeah  it's really interesting  the show's called  Nathan for You  his show  that's a funny show too  and he's hilarious too  like him and Ben  that's a great hour  let me go to 734 
[03:23:30]  you're on after  Opie and Anthony Live  Sam  how you doing?  good buddy  how you doing?  how are you Snowy?  hey I'm okay  you know  I got this bad thing  that Larry's got a lot  of pictures of you  in the back of his truck  yeah it's weird  isn't it?  a little weird  yeah it's a lot weird  dude  I mean  I like your show too  Sam  and I appreciate your  I still love your  entire catalog  despite the fact  that you're  chemically enhanced  with the growth hormone  you mentioned yesterday  on Ron and Fez  but besides that man  I you know  wow  yeah 
[03:24:00]  you want a  you want a Sudoku  puzzle Snowy  have you won anything?  I've never won anything  for the show Sam  I would love a Sudoku  puzzle  okay stay on hold  they'll take your address  you just won Opie's  Sudoku puzzle of the day  which by the way  Opie completed successfully  very good  now  Roland's been playing  this song  the Ben show  with Ben Hoffman  who was on the show  today  is a mix of like  skits and weirdness  and I think there's  some narrative going on  I'm not quite sure 
[03:24:30]  but  Roland found this skit  and Eric  it is in Dillette  the song  yes  so we're gonna have  to play it  and it's Eric's song  that I deemed it  it's not  well Roland called me  into the office  the other day  and goes  Sam  Eric has a new  theme song  and Eric's just  sitting there  doing work  and I go  okay  what is it  and for the last  three days  this song  has been playing  in Roland's office  very loud  loudly  to the point 
[03:25:00]  where people  are walking by  and looking in the office  like what the fuck  is going on in there  and it's been playing  non-stop  Eric if you would  play the song  that Roland  has deemed  the Eric Nagel  theme song  here  on After Opie  and Anthony Live  you hit the ramp  yeah yeah  that counts as a ramp  right  I learned from Denny  Friday night  I just got off  work  my boss  man  he's such a jerk  now Roland likes country  so after work  I went to his house 
[03:25:30]  ate his wife's pussy  and kicked his ass  eating pussy  and kicking ass  eating pussy  and kicking ass  eating pussy  and kicking ass  eating pussy  I'm at the end  of the song right there  I don't think so  that's what I do  I think there's another  does that verse  apply to Eric  the second verse does  alright let's keep  listening  then I get into a fight  Thursday night 
[03:26:00]  I was feeling  pretty good  I was walking down  the boulevard  of Hollywood  I see this young girl  she's smiling at me  so I took her back  to my hotel  and paid the fee  took off her skirt  I knew that something  was wrong  where there's supposed  to be a pussy  this girl had a dong  I was bored  and since I'd paid  any way  I sucked his dick  and then I  kicked his ass  sucking dick  kicking ass  sucking dick 
[03:26:30]  and kicking ass  sucking dick  and kicking ass  louder man  sucking dick  and kicking ass  eating pussy  sucking dick  and kicking ass  eating pussy  sucking dick  and kicking ass  eating pussy  sucking dick  and kicking ass  yeah  you love it  Rowan  Rowan's sitting there  cracking up  I love it 
[03:27:00]  he's been blasting  that song for days  Eric you consider  that your theme song  not at all  why do you consider  that Eric's theme song  he's a renaissance man  he does everything  what does he do  eating pussy  sucking dick  and kicks ass  Eric I saw you  on Friday  last Friday  you were kicking ass  thank you  do you eat pussy  sure  and Rowan  he also sucks dick  no  another ball patron  yeah  yeah he does  Rowan's just sitting  there singing the song  how does it go  eating pussy  sucking dick 
[03:27:30]  and kicking ass  that's the first time  he got it right  because anytime  he tries to describe  that song to somebody  he gets it  completely wrong  and then he goes  oh wait  I'll just play it for you  and then he emailed  it to like  Rob Cross  our boss  he's like  just so you know  this is Eric's theme song  sucking dick  he didn't push  a kicking ass  he loved it too  yeah  yeah  I had to  I messaged Eric  the other day  when you know  because we talk on  Messenger  the whole show  and I was like  Eric put your  Messenger on  like I was making  hand signals at him  yeah the show  had just started  and Eric's like 
[03:28:00]  looking at Sal  like why is Sam  being such a dick  he's like you know  reprimanding me  for not having  my Messenger on  and then he turns  it on  and the first message  pops up  and it just says  eating pussy  sucking dick  and kicking ass  another one pops up  and it says  kicking ass  sucking dick  eating pussy  sucking dick  and kicking ass  all three of those  for you huh  young Eric  no  let's hear it  a little bit again  I'd like to hear  low  you know  low in the mix  Rolly go get Sal  real quick  I want to  want him to 
[03:28:30]  back up my claim  hey Sal  Sal  how are you  yeah  guess what we're  playing Sal  you don't have to  wait until  after the show  guess what we're  playing  you don't have to  wait until  after the show  to hear it  before you put  the headphones on  what do you think  I'm talking about  sucking dick  yeah yeah  put that  eating pussy  kicking ass  eating pussy  kicking ass  do you think  this is Eric's  theme song too 
[03:29:00]  absolutely  you do  yeah  and why is that  because it's like  Eric's lifestyle  alright so he eats  pussy  yeah  he kicks ass  yes  and  sucks that dick  he does  pussy in the night  eat a lot of pussy  then I get  into a fight  you get into fights  a lot Eric  no not really  on twitter  he does  I was feeling  pretty good  I'll keep this  low in the mix  here  why this part  well you said  to keep it low  in the mix  but once the hook  pipes in  you can boost it 
[03:29:30]  again  give the people  what they want  to hear  this is still  a verse  so we can talk  over it a little  bit  you love this  sound  I've heard this  song maybe  no exaggeration  probably 30 times  in the past two  days  alright let's bump  it up Eric  this is you buddy  sucking dick  Eric you didn't  bump it up  kicking ass  sucking dick  and kicking ass  sucking dick  and kicking ass  you brought it  down at the  wrong time  didn't you  sucking dick  and kicking ass  eating pussy 
[03:30:00]  sucking dick  and kicking ass  you know it Eric  eating pussy  sucking dick  eating pussy  sucking dick  eating pussy  you're bad with  your fingers  Eric  you actually  that time  you just  brought it  down for  eating pussy  yeah  like that's  not fun  That's a funny song, but what's funnier than that song is the fact that Roland will not stop playing it.  And then he's sitting there in the office while apparently he, quote-unquote, books talent.  I don't know exactly what he does with his days, but he's sitting there. 
[03:30:30]  His chair, I don't know if it's his weight or the fact that he's just jumping on it all the time.  Eric broke it.  But his chair leans back all the way, so it's like he's in a layback chair in a first-class lounge.  I thought Eric broke it. I was pissed, and then he goes back farther, and I'm very happy right now.  Apparently they have layback chairs in first-class. I've never flown first-class, so I wouldn't know.  But he leans back all the way. He puts on his child-sized Indiana Jones hat, and he starts singing along to Eatin' Pussy, Kickin' Ass. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, but he also has an outfit.  Huh?  He also has an outfit. He puts on this hat, and then he pretends he's playing guitar with his building IDs.  Do you do that sometimes, Roland?  I suck dick, kick ass, and eatin' Pussy.  And what's this character's name? E-Rock?  Yeah.  Roland has this new character as well.  The southerner.  Oh, the guy from Nolens.  I don't know what you guys do.  Roland, this character is fucking good.  Your office is chaos.  This character's really good.  He starts mumbling that Creole Cajun speak. 
[03:31:30]  We have two different offices.  And it's hard enough to understand them.  We have two different offices.  Travis and me sit in one office.  Eric, Roland, and Sal sit in the other office.  And I swear to God, it's chaos coming from that office.  Just yelling and crashes.  Just randomly happening.  And we hear him in our office.  Just something crashing.  And we go, I don't know what they're doing.  But you run in and hang out.  Yeah, yeah.  You hear, like, yelling and shit, and then you come flying right in, Sam.  Yeah, but you know what?  I come in. 
[03:32:00]  I take a look.  I have a laugh.  And then I leave.  It continues on, though.  It's like being in college.  It's like being in a dorm room in our office.  It's a lot of fun.  It really is.  Very homoerotic dorm room, though.  No, it's not homoerotic.  Roland's singing songs about Eric sucking dick.  But that's just a daily occurrence.  And he puts a kickin' ass.  And what else?  He puts a kickin' ass.  And?  Suckin' dick.  Think about sucking dick and he puts a kickin' ass.  What's this?  I wish.  I wish that Ben were here. 
[03:32:30]  I wish he'd come in studio.  Because Roland would have flipped out.  He'd never get starstruck with anybody.  Yeah.  And he would have flipped out to meet the Eatin' Pussy guy.  Yes.  That's awesome.  The guy who wrote the E-Rock song.  Yes.  And then his other ones.  He's a football coach.  That's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That one was so fun.  You guys love Ben.  Ben rules.  Yeah.  He has a football one.  And then he has a hugging one with ladies.  Yeah, black ladies hugging. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, that one was great.  And the text message one.  They're hilarious.  Yes.  But what's the best one?  They're all equally very good.  What's the best one?  There's one that I've seen replayed many times.  Oh, the sucking dick and you pussy.  Let's hear it again, E-Rock.  And I want to, like, sing along a little bit.  You know all the words.  I don't think so.  Yeah, but you sing it.  Well, I just sing the chorus.  Regardless of whether you know the words or not, you sing along to it all the time.  Friday night, Eric comes to work. 
[03:33:30]  You like that?  It's a jerk.  Eric, you feel that way about your boss?  No.  Good.  Eat his wife's pussy and he kicked his ass.  Eating pussy.  Turn down the lyrics.  Eating pussy and kicking ass.  Eating pussy.  Kicking ass.  Eating pussy and kicking ass.  Yeah.  There it is.  That's what I do.  That's what I do.  Way to go, Roland.  Pussy in the...  No name from Louisiana. 
[03:34:00]  Hey, there you go.  How about the hetero version?  Sucking pussy, kicking dick, and eating ass.  Could work, I guess.  Nate, I don't know.  Nate in Syracuse.  Nate.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  You going to see Jim this weekend?  Yeah, I am.  I'm going to see him Friday night.  I try to get him on Saturday, but those shows are sold out.  Yeah, man.  He's very popular.  Yeah.  To wrap up, Joe. 
[03:34:30]  I just want to say, what do you think about Gummy Bears and the Wuzzles?  I don't know anything about the Wuzzles, but Gummy Bears was chick shit.  Where's Alan Thicke Jr.?  He should be in here.  He's on the phones.  No, send him in here.  Get off the phones and go in there.  Yeah.  Stop sucking dick.  You need to put some kicking ass.  Kicking ass.  You don't have to hang up.  Put him on hold.  Marshall in Texas.  Sammy.  Is that in pesos, Robert?  That's right.  Oh, dude.  You really think it's the lightest to go up against Ronnie B.? 
[03:35:00]  No, I'm not competing with Ron and Fez.  I don't make the timetables.  Raw Dog was just like, hey, Bert's coming in at 11.  Do you want to talk to him?  I was like, yep.  You got a lot of balls, Sammy.  You got a lot of balls.  I have a lot of balls.  Not a lot of talent, but at least I have balls.  Sammy.  Yeah, buddy.  Give me one of those Sudokus, man.  No.  Call tomorrow.  Go suck some dick.  And what else can you do?  Kick ass.  I'll talk to you later, Marshall. 
[03:35:30]  Let's go to 571.  You're on the after show.  571.  Sammy, Robert.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Buddy, what's going on?  I'm fucking in D.C.  I was fucking singing along to that song.  There's some lady in the fucking car next to me just fucking looking at me.  Man, what were you singing?  A fucking sucking dick, sucking pussy, and kicking ass.  My friend, it's sucking dick, eating some pussy, and we're going to kick some of my ass.  I swear. 
[03:36:00]  And you got executives from this company walking down the hall like our bosses, bosses, bosses  are walking down the hall.  Every man eats pussy, sucks dick, and we all kick ass.  Yeah, every man doesn't suck dick, Rowan.  It happens, my friend.  2013.  Open-minded.  I've got to be a little more open-minded.  Alan Thicke Jr.  Kicking ass.  Have you heard this song throughout the last few days?  I heard a little bit of it yesterday before I left.  Yeah.  It's pretty good. 
[03:36:30]  You like it?  I like it a lot.  Kicking ass.  It's been on a lot.  Like, Rowan plays it over and over and over again.  Yeah, I know, but I'm always just, you know, cutting drops, so I never really get to hear  the show or, you know, to mingle.  Is that distracting as an intern to have something like this?  Like, the staff members are just sitting there playing songs about sucking dick and eating  pussies all day.  It's called the research, my friend.  Yeah?  Yeah, for a guest.  Because I suck dick, eat pussy, and I kick ass. 
[03:37:00]  What do you think of that, Alan?  I think it's funny.  You like it?  I like it a lot.  You like it?  And you're a fan?  I'm a big fan.  Good.  203.  Hey, yeah, not to change this song, but he's also got a really funny song I saw last night,  Sliding Cars.  Ooh.  Wow.  It's about, like, the news reports and how they focus on, during the winter, on sliding  cars.  So, yeah, he had, like, his show.  I mean, it's weird that you guys are talking about this, because his show is, I just started  watching it the last couple days.  It's fucking hilarious. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  It's one of the funniest shows on TV, I think.  It came out of nowhere.  Thanks, dude.  It came out of nowhere, and we all, like, we're very sort of cautious when new shows  come on, especially new shows that are billed as comedy shows.  Very cautious, easygoing when it comes to, before we pounce to judgment, we're not quick  to say something's funny.  But we started looking up clips from Ben's show, and we were laughing our balls off at  all of them.  Roland started sucking dicks.  And how you pussing a kicked ass, my friend? 
[03:38:00]  715.  I can't hear you.  Don't suck some dick, my friend.  281.  What's up, Shane?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, it's Kevin in Houston.  How are you?  Good.  Hey, I have a question for E-Rock.  He might be able to answer that.  That Eat My Short song that y'all played earlier?  Yeah, Rick Dees.  Yeah.  Didn't that come out right about the time when Bart Simpson, when the t-shirt, the whole  Eat My Short thing?  I vaguely remember that.  No, I think it was out actually before The Simpsons came out. 
[03:38:30]  It was.  Rick Dees' song came out in 84.  So.  Because a lot of Top 40 shows used to play, because it was all on the Dr. Demento samplers.  203, you're on after O.P.  Anthony Live.  Yeah, watch Deers on the News.  That's a really funny clip by Ron Schell.  Look, look.  You can get all kinds of Ben Schell clips on YouTube.  Look them up yourself.  I'm not just going to play clips all day, right?  Right, Alan Thicke Jr.?  No, you don't answer to anybody, Sam.  Did you get excited?  Did you like our discussion on Tuesday? 
[03:39:00]  What do you mean, I don't entertain anybody?  Oh.  Well, I mean.  That's the whole thing.  Alan, that's what I'm trying to do here, is entertain everybody.  What do you mean, I don't entertain anybody?  No, answer.  No, it's answer.  Oh, you said answer to?  No, I said answer to.  It came out too easily.  Find a clip.  Find a clip, Eric.  I said answer.  Alan Thicke Jr., you're going to be tried in court right now.  No, I have nothing but respect for you, Sam.  I suck dicky pussy kickass, my friend.  You do.  That's not what we're talking about right now, Roland, but continue.  I apologize.  You've got to go to after show court right now, because I think you just said you don't 
[03:39:30]  entertain anybody.  No, I said answer.  And if you did, I feel like I should take offense to that, because...  You should smash it.  No.  Well, that's just a cardboard box, Roland.  You could probably replace it.  You looking for that clip, Eric?  Yeah, one second.  You sure you're not sucking dick in there?  Positive.  Kicking ass?  He ain't kicking ass.  What's he doing?  Sucking some pussy.  Sucking some pussy.  Sal, you heard...  What did you hear Alan Thicke Jr. say?  It sounded like you said entertain to me.  That's why no one reacted. 
[03:40:00]  I was like, wait a minute, did he just say that?  Yeah, I was like on a train of thought, and I had to double back.  Yeah.  I tend to mumble a lot.  That wasn't mumble.  That was fucking...  I said answer.  I swear.  All right, let me hear the clip.  All right.  Everyone be quiet.  Listen.  Right, Alan Thicke Jr.?  No, you don't answer to anybody, Sam.  Okay.  Whoa!  Yeah!  Fuck, you know what?  We don't entertain anything he's going to do today.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Play it again.  All right, hang on.  Because that was mumbled, and I'm willing to give you benefit of a doubt.  Everybody, don't... 
[03:40:30]  Listen for answer to, not entertain, and see if you hear it.  Right, Alan Thicke Jr.?  No, you don't answer to anybody, Sam.  Now I hear answer to.  I hear them both.  I don't hear answer to at all.  I hear answer to at all.  Did you say answer to?  I said answer to.  Because I try to answer to people.  There is a tain in there.  Yeah.  I said answer to.  How many people do you think I entertain?  No one or some people?  Anybody who hears your silvery tongue.  Okay.  All right, all right.  What's wrong with that, Sal?  You would give me some more compliments.  It sounded weird. 
[03:41:00]  606, you're in after Opie and Anthony live.  Sucking dick.  Kickin' ass.  Yeah.  Don't forget about eating my pussy, my friend.  Eating my...  You asked him to eat your pussy, Roland.  Yes.  Sometimes Roland gets confused.  We all get confused a little bit.  But Roland looks like you haven't shaved in a couple days.  I'm moving.  You're moving.  I packed everything too early.  I got too excited.  Put everything in the boxes.  When do you move?  When do you move?  Saturday morning.  Wow.  It must be expensive to move. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, it does.  Have you noticed, by the way, when you're looking at...  Because obviously now is the time you start budgeting, right?  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  Are you moving to a more expensive place?  No.  It's comparable.  Yeah.  But still, you gotta put down a new security deposit.  Movers.  Pay for movers?  Holy shit.  You probably just wanna get rid of all...  Like, when I move, I wanna get rid of everything I own.  Yeah.  Because I don't want anything to do with it.  Moving's the worst thing in the world.  Well, it's one of the worst things in the world.  You know what's really the worst thing in the world?  It's using that money that you would use for movers on razors. 
[03:42:00]  Roland, how much do you spend, like, every month on razors?  Probably 40.  How much?  40 bucks.  Is that in pesos?  Yeah, amigo.

[03:44:30]  Friday night, I just got off work.  My boss, man, he's so good.  Does this make you happy, Roland?  So fucking happy.  He does.  So after work, I went to his house, ate his wife's pussy, and kicked his ass.  You like that line?  And kicking ass.  But for you, Roland, the song is not complete at this part.  You don't only eat.  You feel like there's more you could be doing.  It's a little bit more.  Yeah.  That's what I do.  But what else, Roland? 
[03:45:00]  Pussy in the morning.  Pussy in the night.  I need a lot of pussy, then I get into a fight.  Roland's just mumbling into the mic.  Let's go to, uh, turn it down a little bit.  3-1-4.  Walking down the boulevard of Hollywood.  3-1-4, buddy.  You're on the air.  Yeah, how you doing?  The phone sucks.  Everybody, get some good phones today.  3-3-7.  What the fuck are you doing, man?  I just got back in my truck, and you're eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass. 
[03:45:30]  That's right, my friend.  Roland, is that what you're doing?  That's what I'm doing every day.  Who does that more than anyone?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Sucking dick and kicking ass.  Sucking dick and kicking ass.  E-Rock, are you happy that this is replacing the Paul Abdul theme that you had before?  Eating pussy, sucking dick.  This is a trade-off, I will say that.  Yeah.  Even though this one literally says that you suck dick.  It's badass, though.  It is badass.  It's not like sucking dick in a gay way. 
[03:46:00]  No.  It's like he's a badass.  He does everything.  What does he do?  He eats some pussy, he sucks some dick, and he will kick some ass.  505.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Uh, hey.  So, you know, earlier when you guys were talking about the Rick Dees and his bombing of his  second Gorilla song or whatever it was, um, you know, there was a real shitty movie  put out in the 70s called Record City, and he made cameos in it.  He was like the backdrop, and he went by, like, Gordon Kong. 
[03:46:30]  That was his name.  Gordon Kong?  And Gordon...  Always trying to sell something.  Three...  I mean, I'm going to sit there and listen to Rick Dees' life story, though.  Three, one, four.  Maybe that was Rick Dees.  Yeah, you know, if you guys were talking about Rick Dees, I got a story to tell you.  Three, one, four.  Nope.  Seven, one, five.  Seven, one, five.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Sammy, it's Mongo.  What's up, Mongo?  Now you sound good.  Well, you know, I love that new song, except I'm a pacifist, so I won't kick some ass. 
[03:47:00]  But the rest of it's good.  So, Rowan, what does that mean Mongo's going to be doing?  He's going to be eating some pussy and sucking some dick.  Eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  Except for that last part.  What's going on, Mongo?  Eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  Eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  Is that it?  Well, no, I think Struth is probably on Suicide Watch now that Larry's taking over the superfan role.  Look, there's Mongo, there's Struth, there's Larry, there's Snowy, there's a lot of Sam Roberts  superfans, and there's plenty of Sam Roberts to go around. 
[03:47:30]  I stay on the air, son.  But Struth was the first.  He was the first.  I'll never forget Struth, Mongo, and I'll never forget you.  443.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, Rowan, I learned today that Rowan loves eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  Eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  Yeah, you do, right, Rowan?  I do.  Pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  Bring me a good pussy and good cock, and I'll suck it around.  Whoa. 
[03:48:00]  Holy shit.  You got a lot of isolating to do.  You know that, don't you, Sal?  Yes.  4, 2, 3.  Rowan, were you not aware that that would be happening?  Don't forget your show.  Yeah, you're comfortable, aren't you?  Yeah.  I love it.  4, 2, 3.  Yeah, eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  These are the family values my mom and dad have taught me since growing up.  Yeah.  Couldn't wrap my brain around the kicking ass part, but the rest I got down.  You got it down, Pat. 
[03:48:30]  Rowan, what are some of the values that your parents brought you up with?  Love Jesus, sucking dick, and pussy, and kicking ass.  Eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  Eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  Eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  337.  Why the fuck can't I be a super fan?  I follow you to every single show.  I call you every single show, and I give you information to go to WrestleMania.  What the fuck do I need to do? 
[03:49:00]  I know who you are.  This is the Joker, isn't it?  Yes.  I am a super fan, but you never tell anyone, Sam.  I'm hurt.  Sal, make the list.  Joker's on it.  You keep track of that, okay?  Are you going to listen to me and Bert Kreischer on Raw Dog in 20 minutes?  I'm going to chase you down, buddy.  I'd love to hear it.  Thanks, buddy.  See ya.  Alan Thicke, Jr., I'm glad you're here.  Thank you.  I'm always glad you're here.  You know that.  I think you're electric.  I think you're personality personified. 
[03:49:30]  Roland, what are some of the things that Alan Thicke, Jr., you've noticed he likes to do?  Sleep, and then he wakes up.  He likes to suck dick, eat some pussy, kick some ass.  Yeah.  Sucking dick.  And kicking ass.  Sucking dick and kicking ass.  Right.  Right.  I mean, we all have hobbies, Alan.  Don't even worry about it.  Were you happy with the way Tuesday's show went?  Did you like the 90s TV conversations?  You know, I liked it a lot.  I guess my main issue was, I was like six years old when all those cartoons were running 
[03:50:00]  on, so I didn't really have a rich, you know, history with that.  A lot of my...  You're like what Sam Roberts is to Opie and Anthony when he's sitting there going, guys,  are we really talking about Miami Vice right now?  I'm off the map here.  I don't know what we're doing.  84.  That show came out when I was one years old.  Okay?  Yeah.  One.  You're sitting there being like, well, that's how I feel on the after show sometimes.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Because you're like sitting there going, David the what?  The gnome?  No, I'm not aware. 
[03:50:30]  No.  It's not my speed.  No.  I'm here to talk about our real monsters and Hey Arnold.  That's my shit.  That's what you're saying, right?  Right.  Did you see that I posted the figure it out clip?  Yeah, of course.  The game show that I was talking about on Ron and Fez yesterday.  It's on my YouTube page, not Sam.  I posted the clip of me.  I want you to see this, Alan.  Did you know how old I was in this clip?  Don't say it if you do.  Do you know?  I don't know.  Okay, that's fine.  I'm glad you don't know.  I want you to watch it for a moment. 
[03:51:00]  Once it's queued up and everything, it's on YouTube slash Not Sam if everybody wants  to watch along at home.  All right.  This is me, Alan.  Here comes our next contestant.  Hi, I'm Sam Roberts from New York and I can flip quarters off my ankle.  Is that adorable or what?  What do you think of that, Sal?  It's amazing you have a lower pitch voice here than you do now.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I've been working on my...  This is my broadcast voice.  I sound different off the air. 
[03:51:30]  Sal, do you know how old I am in that clip?  I think you said...  Okay, don't say it.  If I said it, don't say it.  Roland.  So, Sanders has to be a teenager.  Oh, my God.  Roland, she's not a teenager in that clip.  She was 20?  No, she was an adult woman.  That's for Sam Roberts.  Come on out here, Sam.  Do you know how old I am in this clip, Roland?  Don't say it if you do.  I do.  Okay.  Eric, do you know how old I am in this clip?  Don't say it if you do.  I do.  Okay.  Alan, you do not.  I do not.  I want you to predict.  How old do you think I am right there?  Nine.  Nine years old? 
[03:52:00]  Nine years old.  Sal, you know.  Do you know if he's...  Yeah.  Is he correct?  No, he's not correct.  Alan, what would you do right now?  If I told you that fate...  And I want you all to go to...  Look up just Sam Robertson and figure it out.  You can see it.  You've taken home that grand prize.  That's a 14-year-old boy looking at you right there.  That's a 14-year-old kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean...  Roland, what are some 14-year-olds doing with themselves?  Sucking dick, eating pussy, and fixing my ass. 
[03:52:30]  Not that 14-year-old, though.  That little fella?  Just like his own dick.  Yeah.  That 14-year-old fella is trying to avoid priests sucking his dick.  That kid is...  You're talking about arrested development.  That's a special talent that you perform.  That's your boy.  That's little Pete.  Oh, yeah.  I know you love Pete and Pete.  I love Pete and Pete.  Yeah.  So, 14 years old in this clip.  I was a late bloomer, to say the least.  No.  And I swear, I didn't realize it.  I was looking at the clip, and I figured, like you, Alan, I said, I don't know, nine. 
[03:53:00]  I even gave myself...  I knew that I was small for my age, so I even said maybe 12.  Maybe 12.  And I looked at the copyright date at the end of the clip.  It said 98.  Did a little backwards math.  Oh, no.  And I was like, I was 14 going on 15.  Oh, no.  14 going on 15, Alan Thicke, Jr.  I was surprised here yesterday that when you were on Rod and Fez, you were taking growth  hormone.  HGH?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was HGH.  It was human growth hormone.  Wow.  Well, I mean, are you surprised looking at that kid? 
[03:53:30]  I think I was shaving at 14 already.  Yeah, I wasn't even close.  I didn't even have a little peach fuzz trash stash yet.  I had a mustache on it.  Yeah, I mean, Roland, you could have grown a full beard by that time.  I was like a porn star.  Yeah.  Without the pussy.  Well, what were you doing as a porn star at that age?  Just eating.  Eating what?  Sucking dick.  Eating pussy.  Yeah, yeah, I started injecting, because they were sitting there, and I went to the doctor,  and I was like, you know what it's like, Alan Thicke, Jr., to go to the doctor and just 
[03:54:00]  say, he's like, well, what's wrong?  And me to say, I'm really fucking small.  That's what that's, the main problem here is I'm tiny.  I'm minuscule.  How tall were you?  I was not five feet.  Really?  Yeah, I was probably four or nine, maybe?  Wow.  Yeah, I was a shrimp with a big-ass head, too.  Look at that head in that clip.  You were like the younger brother in Freaks and Geeks.  Who, Sam?  That's his name in that show. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  That's a great show, isn't it?  That was an excellent show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and so I went to the doctor, and then he put me on human growth hormone, and I had  to take a human growth hormone.  I had to take injections every day for three years, but then I was able to grow.  Wow.  Which was great.  It's like a fairytale.  It is, it is.  It's like a magic, but in fairytales, the magic that you need in your body is like you  kiss a frog, or you know, you go to sleep on some lilacs, or something like that.  You don't generally have somebody jamming needles into you every day for your teenage 
[03:55:00]  years.  It's humiliating.  Yeah.  But, you know, you get through it.  I think I was taking needles until I was like, probably 16-ish.  Fuck, wow.  Yeah.  But, if I hadn't, the doctor was like, look, I don't think you're going to pass five feet  unless you do this.  I'm looking, because you know, they do what they call a bone age, where they take an  x-ray, and they look at the age of the bone, and they say, well, this is the bone age of  this, whatever.  Like, and I think they measure it based on how much space there is between the bones. 
[03:55:30]  Because once there's no more space between the bones, you're done growing.  So that they're like, you have the bone age of an 11-year-old, and you're 14, or whatever  it is.  So, he goes, yeah, no, I don't think that you're going to get to five feet tall.  And I was like, Roland, if I'm not going to get to five feet tall, what are three things  that I'm never going to be able to do?  Walk outside.  Wow.  People are like, but you could suck some dick.  Yeah?  You ain't going to eat pussy.  No.  You ain't going to kick some ass.  No!  I'm pussy sucking dick and kicking ass. 
[03:56:00]  You'll be a little fella.  A little fella.  Like, in school, I had to make friends with the big guys, and make them laugh, so that  way nobody would beat me up.  I can't, I wasn't going to go into adulthood with the same strategy.  Like, I gotta at least be of average height.  I'm not the biggest guy in the world, but I'm a solid, whatever, 5'9 or so.  Maybe, maybe squeaking near 5'10, Alan.  Don't get it twisted.  Well, I mean, that's perfectly average for a height. 
[03:56:30]  Right.  Yeah.  I wasn't even close to that, though.  Look at that kid.  That's a 14-year-old boy in that clip.  928, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up?  This is my first time calling in.  Where are you from?  I live in Arizona, but I'm originally from Australia.  Incredible.  But, you know, when I was like 11 years old, I had to shave every Sunday because my mom  didn't want me to go to church with a beard. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, I couldn't possibly relate.  Like, I couldn't grow a full beard until I was, I mean, I was definitely in college before  the thought of growing a beard was even, oh, one day I could probably do that.  But there was this kid that I went to school with that was, he was tiny.  And we used to call him Alvin because he was short and he always had a backwards hat on.  But his dad was a doctor and he started baking HGH or what, I know he did some hormone treatment  and now he's like 6'2".  Yeah, I mean, that shit works.  That's why when I hear those athletes doing it, I'm like, yeah, if I was an athlete, I 
[03:57:30]  would definitely do it.  Because I'm way bigger than I used to be.  Did it, like, initiate, like, puberty on you or it just made you grow?  Yeah.  I mean, I wasn't, like, a tall, like, kid, a very tall, prepubescent boy.  No, I mean, I kind of started growing like a human being after that.  Gotcha.  But it wasn't, like, extra HGH.  I obviously didn't have enough in my body.  So they had to put more in me via needles.  Was there an awkward phase when you were on the HGH?  Like, were, like, parts growing a little weird? 
[03:58:00]  Alan, I haven't left my awkward phase yet.  My whole life has been an awkward.  Look at this kid.  You're asking me if this kid on Figure It Out who's getting touched up by Summer Sanders  if he went through an awkward phase?  Yeah.  This is me doing my stunt, Alan.  You're going to be amazed by this.  I can't wait to hear your reaction.  Flicking quarters off my ankle like a motherfucker.  601, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  Holy shit.  Did Alan Big Jr. just say he heard your interview with Ron and Fez yesterday?  You're double-jointed, right? 
[03:58:30]  Did you hear me on Ron and Fez yesterday?  No.  No, that must have been Sal.  Aw, shit.  Okay, well, then my joke was going to fail anyway.  I'm out.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye, buddy.  Did you see that?  You impressed?  Absolutely amazing.  Amazing, right?  Amazing.  You can't do that.  The most I've ever been able to do was pinch something with my big toe and fling it across  the room, but that's nothing.  Yeah, I didn't even move my foot.  Did you see when I flicked?  I flicked a quarter off my ankle.  I didn't even move my foot.  Sal, you can't do that.  No.  No way.  Are you impressed?  Highly.  See?  It's kind of gross, though.  How did you learn how to do that? 
[03:59:00]  I had to learn how to do something.  I was four foot nothing.  What else am I going to spend my time doing?  I mean, Roland, what are the three things I'm not going to spend my time doing?  Eating pussy, sucking dick, and kicking ass.  That's right.  That's exactly right.  203, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam, is that HCA the reason why your dick grew all messed up and why you had to get  it circumcised at a later age?  No, I don't think so.  By the way, my dick didn't grow all messed up.  I don't need you spreading that around, okay?  It was like a slinky, you said, right?  No, I didn't. 
[03:59:30]  It was a slinky, and sometimes I would let it walk down the stairs before me.  No.  It was phomosis.  You can ask Dr. Steve about that.  He's mentioned it on his show a bunch of times.  But no, it didn't fuck my dick up.  If anything, I injected human growth hormone, and now it's huge.  Did that sound like it was...  So convincing.  Okay, thank you, Sam.  I needed that.  You have a brother, right?  Yeah.  Did he have to do the similar treatments?  No.  No.  That's when I knew.  I was like, okay, my younger brother is two years younger than me.  He's starting to get a little taller than me. 
[04:00:00]  I can't be having this.  So that was like a real indicator.  Plus, he's much better looking than me.  Okay.  So I was like, this is not good.  And, and, Sal, at this point, he's getting taller than me.  And I already know at 14, he's better looking than me, and he's more charming than me.  I can't have him be taller than me, Sal.  Give me whatever juice you got to give me, because I got to, I got to at least be of  the same height.  Now, we're about even.  But, I've increased in charm immensely.  Oh, yeah.  I know. 
[04:00:30]  I'm charming the pants off you as we speak.  Oh, my God.  9-7-3.  Hey, Sammy.  I was probably like the same size as you, like as a freshman.  And luckily, I had a growth spurt.  I'm, you know, I'm about 5'8", 5'9", too.  Did you play any sports?  Because you have no muscle tone whatsoever.  No.  I wrestled for one season, and I, I was, I started, me and my friend, who was like,  he was the same size as me, the same height, but he was really fat.  So, they just used to match him up with guys that weighed the same as him.  So, this tiny little fat kid had to wrestle all the big muscular kids, because they were 
[04:01:00]  the same weight.  So, me and him, we went through an entire season with not one victory.  We were all in, like, 16 or something like that.  Terrible.  I've never been very athletic.  And you were also completely disinterested in that version of wrestling.  Yeah.  Like, where the fuck's the microphone and the fucking lights and shit?  They were, they were like, all right, Sam, go up to the mat.  And hold that man.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Yeah, they're like, just go up to the mat.  And I'm like, yeah, well, why wouldn't you play my music?  Like, how am I supposed, like, how is the crowd going to know that I'm entering the arena? 
[04:01:30]  I don't understand what you're saying.  I have no fringes on my singlet.  7-5-7.  Yes.  What's up, buddy?  You should change the lyrics to that song, eating pussy, sucking dick, and eating ass.  Okay.  Well, see if that, see if, I don't think, you wouldn't have let that guy through, would  you?  No.  It's a terrible, terrible call.  Terrible joke.  6-4-7, last call of the day.  Hey, Sammy.  The best part about your game show appearance is that you win a basketball net. 
[04:02:00]  That's right.  What am I going to do with that?  You know what I did with it?  I sold it and bought wrestling toys.  That's what I did with that basketball hoop.  Listen, got to go.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Alan Thicke, Jr., are you here tomorrow?  I will be here tomorrow.  All right, then you're going to pitch your bit tomorrow that you've been waiting for weeks  to pitch.  You're going to pitch it tomorrow.  It's going to be great.  Ron and Fez are up next on this channel.  I'll be on Raw Dog at 11 a.m.  talking to Bert Kreischer.  So a lot of stuff going on on SiriusXM.  It's an exciting time to be you.  Goodbye. </pre>
