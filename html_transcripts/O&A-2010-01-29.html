<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about new NYC taxi regulations banning Bluetooth devices, cell phones, GPS, and satellite radio.  The hosts speculated on the reasoning, suggesting an overreaction to a single incident. This led to a broader conversation about societal overreactions, citing examples like the removal of dictionaries from schools due to a complaint about "oral sex" and the removal of books like "The Diary of Anne Frank."  The dangers of texting while driving, deemed worse than drunk driving by the hosts, were also highlighted. A trucker called in, corroborating the frustration with new regulations and the boredom of long hauls.  Numerous calls followed, covering aggressive cab drivers, distracted driving, and the show's own problematic phone system, which led to several awkward, unscreened calls.  The hosts' frustration with American prudishness compared to other cultures was a recurring theme, illustrated with discussions and pictures of topless women on European beaches.  James, a trucker, also called in.

The show continued with a caller, Robin from Detroit, sparking a discussion about the removal of dictionaries from schools.  The conversation quickly became explicit, revolving around teenage access to pornography and graphic descriptions of the hosts' own adolescent searches. Kate from Boston then recounted her humorous experience searching for "oral sex" online.  Further calls discussed faulty Toyotas and teenage pornography experiences. This segued into a discussion of a listener's "Stalker Patty" Kesha song recording, followed by opinions on musical artists and auto-tune.  A tangent about a listener's IRS issues after winning a lottery then ensued.  The show then turned to Nick Cannon's new radio show and his use of the Reynolds Group, a talent coaching firm.  The hosts and studio guest, Sam, mocked the firm's marketing materials and "hot topics" list, with callers surprisingly accurately predicting major news items.  The hosts ridiculed the Reynolds Group's suggested radio bits, particularly "Jailhouse Idol," concluding with further mockery of Nick Cannon and sexually explicit jokes.

A subsequent segment focused on the merits (or lack thereof) of the talent coach's proposed radio bits, including a potentially offensive "Sex Offender Idol" and a "Whose Mama Knows" segment.  A "What Kids Know" segment, attempting to engage children in discussions about current events, proved extremely awkward and inappropriate.  The segment featured discussions about audience engagement and the hosts' struggles with implementing the talent coachâ€™s ideas, along with continued inappropriate language.  A shocking turn involved a detailed, graphic discussion and visual inspection of Bobo's anus by Bobby Kelly and E-Rock due to Bobo reporting blood in his stool, featuring extreme vulgarity and descriptions. Guests Bobby Kelly (who left and returned) and Bobo were present, along with numerous callers contributing to the chaotic and offensive broadcast.

The show concluded with a sexually explicit phone conversation with "Bobo," detailing graphic sexual acts and descriptions of his alleged penis size.  Sexually suggestive banter with female callers, Sharon and Shannon, also occurred.  A crude paper cutout of a face was placed on Bobo's (allegedly) exposed penis during a webcam conversation with the help of studio guest Danny.  Bobby was also present.  The conversation shifted to home invasions, firearms, target practice, and the racial demographics of target practice figures. Discussions ensued regarding gun ownership, self-defense, personal safety concerns, and experiences with crime. The show ended with announcements about upcoming comedy shows and an event at Bar 9.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio.  We've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was where, you know, language was realistic. 
[00:00:30]  It's fucking raw.  Destroy it.  Sexual content is realistic.  And just fucking people reacting with people is realistic.  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name.  Shit radio.  All right, we hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hole is.  That's funny.  This is shit radio.  And it fucking stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning.  I was listening to those news clips in our intro.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Controversy follows us.  Controversy.  Is this the last straw?  That clip's about five years old.  I know.  Shut up, news.  You're stupid.  They kept saying that.  Well, that was regular radio, too, so.  No, that's true.  Regular radio.  Regular radio, which apparently is the only thing that cabbies can listen to now in New 
[00:01:30]  York City.  Yeah, that was kind of, uh...  I think we just lost our cab audience over here.  Yeah.  New York City.  Wow.  They're just fucking these cabbies so bad.  And fucking all of us that take cabs.  Yeah.  Because there's more surcharges.  It used to be a, uh, like a quick five, maybe six dollar cab ride to work.  Yeah.  It's now ten.  Ten bucks.  I can...  And once again, I can afford a ten dollar cab ride. 
[00:02:00]  But I start thinking about, there's a lot of people that can't just afford ten dollar  cab rides.  Yeah.  In New York City.  On a day like this, it's freezing in New York.  And the cabbies say it.  They say, you know, ever since they added the latest surcharge, you know, our business  is way down.  People are taking the bus more, even though they don't want to.  Walking.  They're discovering the subway system.  They're walking.  Yep.  If it's not a cold day like today.  Whacking, whacking.  And now what they're doing to the damn cabbies in New York, they have Bluetooth. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And they're so...  Their job is where they drive for 12 straight hours.  I think their shifts are 12.  Some of them are 16 straight hours.  It's crazy.  They're in a cab by themselves, fucking just miserable, lonely.  They can't really ever get out of the cab, because you can't park, because you'll get  a ticket.  You know, they leak into bottles.  And most of them, most of these savages bring their own lunch.  So they got a Bluetooth.  They figured out, all right, if I'm going to be in a cab 12 or 16 hours, I'm going to 
[00:03:00]  talk to my loved ones way back, you know, back home or whatever.  Yeah.  And they're on their phones the entire shift.  But they have a Bluetooth.  Yeah, it's hands-free.  You know, none of them hold the cell phones anymore.  Right.  Right.  A lot of times you think the cabbie's talking to you, and you realize, oh, he's got a Bluetooth  in his left ear.  I didn't see the Bluetooth.  Yeah.  There's been so many times I've gone, excuse me?  Yeah.  Like, I can't hear what he's saying.  He's just babbling to some fucking guy.  I don't know.  So someone got the bright idea.  And I know this isn't what happens. 
[00:03:30]  One dumb cabbie had a Bluetooth, I'm sure, and got into some horrific accident, unfortunately,  and probably killed some people.  So now that one dummy who couldn't handle it ruined it for all the cabbies.  Starting today, they're not allowed to have their Bluetooth.  Yeah.  And they're not allowed to be on their phones at all.  That's just like, now that's what I heard when they first announced this.  It's like, all right, no Bluetooth, no phones.  And then you're like, wow, that sucks for them.  When is that going to be enacted and stuff? 
[00:04:00]  Apparently it's today.  And then, did you hear any of this other stuff before today?  No.  So all we heard was the Bluetooth and the phone.  But now we find out today, on the day it goes into effect, that other things are included.  Right.  GPS.  Right.  Now, does this include the, is it just the yellow cabs, or is it also the TLC black cars  who need GPS to go anywhere?  They're dummies.  Well, yeah, the black cars, I don't think this applies to the black cars.  I better not.  And they're way worse than the cabbies. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Those black cars will, they will bang right into you.  They don't care.  For some reason, they don't care.  But a cabbie, when, you know, he's getting aggressive, we've talked about this, you just  make a little aggressive move back to them, they back way off.  Because if they get a ding on their cabs, they're fucked.  Yeah, then they get in trouble.  They get in some serious trouble.  So they're not allowed to have GPS in their cabs.  Right.  They're also not allowed, we found out, to have satellite radio.  Yeah.  They can't have satellite radio in their cabs. 
[00:05:00]  But they could use their regular radio, I guess.  Well, I know when I'm punching around, you know, the Sirius XM, it's a bit complicated  with the touchscreen, meaning there's so many choices.  You start kind of focusing a little too much, trying to figure out what you want out.  Yeah, but you zero in, like, and have your presets like you do on your regular radio.  Regular radio, though.  I mean, how many choices do you really have in any city?  For real, five.  But how many presets do you really use on your satellite?  More than five?  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, easily, yeah.  Easily.  I got to do a little sports. 
[00:05:30]  I got to do a little news.  I got to do a little classic rock.  I got to do a little alt-nation.  And this stupid morning mashup, because we know them.  I fucking listen to them at times.  Even though the music is garbage.  Garbage.  Although it's catchy as hell sometimes, I got to tell you.  You'll find yourself toes-happing to you.  Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.  Stupid Lady Gaga and her catchy songs.  But, yeah, it's satellite radio, because you're punching around on the touchscreen.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  All of a sudden, you want to know who's singing that song, so you hit info.  I don't know.  So you're doing a lot more in there than the average guy.  You got a GPS where, if you're in motion, it just refuses you to continue, right?  Can't input.  They probably, hate to say it, they probably need that with the satellite radio, if it continues to grow.  Wow.  I hate to say it.  Oh, it sucks.  Because the Sirius XM could be as complicated as the GPS at times, when you start punching around.  You know what?  No.  The most dangerous fucking thing, texting while driving. 
[00:06:30]  I have to say.  Fuck, don't take that away from me.  Don't take that away from me.  Worse than drunk driving.  And you know what?  At least if you drive drunk, your eyes are at least trying to be on the road.  Trying to focus.  When you're texting, it's just, you are just, texting away, looking up.  Am I going to rear-end this motherfucker?  And you know you can get a couple extra letters in before you have to look up.  Before you've got to look up.  I can finish that word. 
[00:07:00]  Texting, mark my word, within the next year is going to be illegal in most states.  Because there's a movement that is just swelling now.  Yeah.  I think Oprah isn't involved.  And when she gets involved with stuff, forget it.  It's over, Johnny.  But there's a swell.  They're trying to stop people from texting and driving.  Which, you know what?  Can't really argue that.  Big crackdown here in New York City.  They're cracking down on people texting.  Really?  Yeah.  Even at lights, they said.  Even if you're at a red light, stopped, no texting. 
[00:07:30]  And then, no texting, sitting parked in your car.  I don't even know.  It's like, you can't text in your car.  You know what?  You know where the speedometer is?  Yeah.  That's where I do my texting.  That's where you text?  How the hell are you going to know?  Yeah, you got to do it on the down low.  Now it's more dangerous.  I have my two hands on the steering wheel, and my hands are shorter through the steering wheel,  holding my freaking BlackBerry.  I'm texting and driving.  I'm texting and driving.  Now it's more dangerous, because at least before the laws, you could hold the phone up  in plain view.  Sure.  Look at the road. 
[00:08:00]  Text.  Now you're putting it way down here and taking your eyes completely off the road.  I want a see-through windshield.  I want my texting right on the inside of the windshield.  Heads-up display.  A HUD, like a fighter plane.  Thank you.  That's it.  Yeah, it works well for the military.  I want a HUD on my vehicle.  If a fighter pilot can use it doing Mach 3, how about we use it in our cars, where you  can look at the windshield.  Yeah.  You're texting.  Your text is up there in the letters on the windshield.  That would rock.  Yeah.  But the cabbies got fucked because they took their Bluetooth away. 
[00:08:30]  That is just stupid.  We all had determined a long time ago, hands-free phones is fine when you're driving, right?  Yeah, that's where they went to.  They went, oh my God, people are crashing when they're doing...  All right, that's kind of funny.  Danny found a picture of a guy's windshield with a heads-up display, and it's obviously  photoshopped, but it's covered with Starbucks ads, the speedometer, the weather.  The weather.  It looks like...  The video chat window. 
[00:09:00]  The video chat's open.  That's classic.  That's a good one.  That rules.  Let me say hi to James, the trucker.  James.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, James.  Yeah, we just got...  I drive a truck, and we just found out this week, if we get caught texting, it's a $2,750  ticket.  Jesus.  And you know what's so bad about it?  You watch the state patrol ride up and down the road all day long.  Yeah.  With their little computers on the right-hand side, playing around, and going 90 miles 
[00:09:30]  an hour past you.  Yeah, man.  I mean, driving has gotten so boring, we do need other things to do.  It's supposed to be just driving.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to tell you something.  Y'all have saved my job.  Ooh.  Because it's so much more enjoyable to ride up and down the road and listen to y'all.  Well...  Keep my free brain occupied.  Oh, thank you, James.  I know we have a lot of truckers that listen to the show.  We should probably acknowledge that more.  So, thanks, James.  I appreciate it.  Probably.  We won't, but we should probably. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, we probably should.  Wayne in Brooklyn.  Wayne.  Hey, good morning.  Hope you're in that.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Wayne-o.  I call him Wayne-o because he's from Brooklyn.  I sit in my office, but I got to turn it low every time I'm on the phone and you're saying  shit or cunt.  But anyway...  Why?  I dispatch a regular car service in Brooklyn, and our driver's got to follow the same laws  that regular taxi drivers follow.  Huh?  And there's also, like, a 9% tax on all calls that we charge the customer now due to TLC 
[00:10:30]  is taxing us.  Yeah, I don't know.  I guess it's the TLC, right?  That's really...  Oh, it is.  Yeah.  Forget about it.  They're really heartless.  They don't care.  They don't care that guys are sitting around all night just making $15, $20 a night.  You know, it's terrible.  You know, you charge tax.  People would much rather take the bus than spend an extra $2, $3 on a call.  Yeah.  I talk to the cabbies all the time living in New York City, and they're basically saying,  I can't afford to do this anymore.  Yeah, they really are.  I'm not making money at this job anymore. 
[00:11:00]  So I don't know what the hell's going to happen.  Something's going to give.  I'm usually battling it out with them, so I don't really care.  Oh, really?  Oh, in your car.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a constant battle between me and the cabs.  They put $30, $40 in gas a night.  They drive about 12 passengers a night.  They make about maybe $10 in tips, and they just...  They got to spend like $70, $80 outright, and they just come home with about $20, $30 in  their pocket.  Well, isn't it true, like, you have to rent the cab here in New York City for, I think, 
[00:11:30]  $200 a shift or something, so already...  It's about $135 a shift, but then you put your gas.  You think you're going to get about $30 in gas.  Sure.  So now you're $165.  Right.  So you got to make...  Just to have a good day, you got to do about $350, $400 on street pickups.  Yeah.  You know, they're not doing that.  I mean, the first...  The first...  If you're paying $165 just before you even start your shift in a cab, 
[00:12:00]  that's at least 15 fares before you're breaking even.  You're in the hole...  Right.  You're in the hole for...  Right when you start working.  That's great.  The first 15 people you pick up, I mean, more or less, you know, quick math here, and  now you're even, and now you can start making money on your shift.  Yeah.  If the average, you know, cab ride is what, $8 or something.  Yep.  And they can't even get out to use the bathroom, like you said before.  They're sitting in the city.  And if you go to the airport, you can't just, like, drop off at, let's say, JetBlue at JFK 
[00:12:30]  and then pull up a couple of feet and there's somebody getting ready to go.  You got to go in the bullpen and wait until you get called to come out and pick up.  Yeah, they stand in line.  They, like, well, they sit in line in their cars.  I, uh, I find it, um, I understand, but I find it hard to be sympathetic with cabs  because, like I said, every day is a battle with cabs.  Yesterday, driving across town, trying to get to the tunnel, and I get behind a cab, and  when they have that fucking light on where they're looking for people...  Oh, yeah.  Uh, I am missing every fucking green light there is because they're going so slow. 
[00:13:00]  No one's in front of them, I got a clear shot to the next light, and believe me, I could  go across town in two minutes or 15 minutes based on one fucking light.  I miss one light, you miss every crosstown light.  There are times.  Sure, sure.  I make the light, I make all the lights.  Right.  So when that motherfucker's in front of me doing two miles an hour with his head back  and forth looking for a fare, and I'm behind him, I want to kill the motherfucker. 
[00:13:30]  But, see...  Well, I don't feel, I don't feel bad for the cabbies.  Like I said, I dispatch in the regular car service.  Right.  We hate the cabbies, too, you know?  But it's just as hard for us to make the dollar as it is for them.  But, guys, have a great weekend.  All right, guys.  Thanks, sir.  But to go with what you just said, Ant, that's kind of the point I'm making.  That wasn't the case a couple of years ago.  Yeah.  The cabs are so desperate now.  I know, yeah.  We see it in the morning when Kenny drives me to work, where all of a sudden you'll see  a cab go from the left side, I mean, cut straight across an avenue to the right because 
[00:14:00]  he sees a fare, like, in a major panic, like, oh, my God, I need that fare.  Yeah, I've had him cut right in front of me.  And doesn't even give a shit about anybody else on the road.  Yeah.  There's like a desperation out there with those guys to make their money.  I get into yelling matches with cabbies, probably on a weekly basis, where the windows get rolled  down, the pedestrians are laughing their asses off because there's a New York City argument  going on.  Right. 
[00:14:30]  And I just, you know, break out savage and get out of my way.  What are you doing?  You drive like an asshole.  You got to tape that shit.  That's the stuff I want to say.  I know, but I never really know when it's going to pop up.  So I just got to put a hidden camera in my truck.  No, I got a camera for my car now.  Do you?  So I can film everything.  Really?  Just ready to go.  I'm a filming motherfucker right now.  Ready to go.  I got a camera for my bike when I do my loops in Central Park.  I really should pop it in there.  You really should.  Just leave it in there for those occasions.  Because that would be a video I would watch in a second. 
[00:15:00]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You are the asshole.  Yeah.  That's what I get.  You are the asshole.  Fuck you.  Fuck me.  Fuck you.  Fuck your mother.  I start getting into the family and everything.  And especially when they got a horrified fare in the back.  I just see this face in the window looking at me like, oh my goodness gracious, we're doomed.  Or what about the out-of-town businessman holding his briefcase tight up near his chin?  Oh my gosh.  And I'm just yelling, fuck you.  What are you looking at? 
[00:15:30]  You motherfucker.  But once again, the system just, I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck they're doing.  I mean, their cabbies and taking their Bluetooths away.  That's just so fucking stupid.  Yeah, I don't see how that's much of a problem.  And satellite radio, which really is stupid.  And GPS.  Yes, I mean, I've never had, I mean, knock on wood, I've been taking cabs off and on for  the last 10 years on a regular basis.  I've never had an incident.  Yeah.  You know, like I said, I got to knock on something now.  But, so where are all these incidents where they figure it's an epidemic and we got to 
[00:16:00]  take their Bluetooths away?  Where they're crashing.  But that's what happens in this country.  It's not a majority of things that happen where you have to do this.  It's always one dummy that can't handle it.  Huge knee-jerk reaction.  Thank you.  Huge knee-jerk reaction.  And instead of just taking care of that one dummy.  Take it away.  Take it away.  Take it away from everybody.  One person didn't like it.  Well, it happened in satellite radio.  We have one dummy, one hillbilly that couldn't handle having naked broads on a show. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Went too far with the naked broads.  This stupid dummy who I'll never respect.  He's a dumb guy.  He's a stupid hillbilly.  And because of that, instead of the company going, look, you can't handle naked women on  your show.  So you should not have naked women.  As a matter of fact, you should be fired.  Oh, no.  What they do is they make sure no one does anything with naked women on their show.  Yeah.  No one.  Thanks.  As, getting back to your point, knee-jerk reaction. 
[00:17:00]  Good job.  We always handled our nudity, you know, very well on our show.  Of course we did.  Never had an issue, never had a problem, but, you know.  Pros with nude women.  But a law was enacted a few years ago where there's no insertion because this one fucking  dummy couldn't handle it.  And what good is a naked woman if you can't insert something in them?  Yeah, what the fuck you want?  What's the purpose?  You want to talk about the State of the Union address with the broad?  What, are we going to chat?  Hell no.  Watch up in the air? 
[00:17:30]  Hell no.  What are we going to do?  We're inserting.  But, you know, that could be a theme today.  Knee-jerk reaction.  Yeah.  It's kind of ruining the country.  It really is.  There is one recently.  I actually read it on, oh my god, the show prep sheet.  What?  Oh, yes I did.  With the dictionary.  One fucking stick in the mud was upset because of, what was the word?  Oh, oral sex.  I believe oral sex, yes.  Oh, that's right, okay. 
[00:18:00]  Oral sex was in the dictionary, and she was freaking out, one of the dictionaries pulled  from the school, and did they wind up pulling it?  The whole district pulled it.  The whole school district pulled it because oral sex.  Merriam-Webster's dictionary.  It's Webster's.  It's not fucking, you know, penthouse or swank.  They yanked all the dictionaries out of the entire district?  Yeah.  Because one parent complained.  One fucking parent.  One parent.  There's a story today about the Diary of Anne Frank. 
[00:18:30]  What's wrong with that one?  One parent complained that there's a sexual reference in the Diary of Anne Frank.  Is there?  And the school immediately pulled it.  Pulled the Diary?  That is a classic that has been read for years in schools.  And you start checking out pornography by just going through the dictionary.  That's where it all starts.  Yeah, of course.  You look up dirty words.  In our day.  Oh, yeah.  And every once in a while, there would be a nice little diagram.  You can kind of laugh at.  Let's see if fuck is in here. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, it's not there.  It's not there.  But one parent, like you said, knee-jerk reaction.  Yeah.  All the other parents in that district, probably, yeah, all of them, had no problem with it.  Yeah, whatever.  It's in there.  But one dumb parent ruins it for everybody.  Freaked out.  And why are we listening to the one person over and over again?  Why?  You know, the bitch that complained never had a dick in her mouth.  Right.  Ever.  She saw that word in the dictionary and freaked out because it'll remind our husband what he never gets. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  But why?  Why do we do that as a society?  Sociote.  The knee-jerk reaction.  I know.  Because of one fucking person.  It happens in radio all the time, all the complaints.  The FCC complaints are usually based on one person that complains.  And then, you know, it sets the whole machine in motion to get rid of these people.  Yeah, and it ruins it for everybody else. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Why don't they take a survey in that district and sit down the parents?  Do you mind that this is in the fucking dictionary?  It's been in the dictionary since the invention of the dictionary.  She'd rather they not have a dictionary because it has a...  Isn't it funny that it's oral sex and it's a dictionary?  Yeah, exactly.  I just found that kind of ironically a little chuckle.  Let's say hi to Chris in the Poconos.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  Hey, you in the big champagne glass?  Or the heart-shaped tub?  Oh, yeah, the heart-shaped tub. 
[00:20:30]  It's just the same joke.  How was the horseback riding this morning?  Yeah.  Did you play ping pong with a couple from Wisconsin?  I only work there, guys.  What about shuffleboard?  Yeah.  Did you take a blacklight into one of the rooms and look at the Peter Max painting on the floor?  What's up, Chris?  Yeah, I drive 80 miles into the Poconos every day.  And I'm bored as hell while I'm driving. 
[00:21:00]  So I'm watching TV on YouTube, like eight-part episodes.  I'm looking at the Internet, you know, whatever, and calling you guys, not using my Bluetooth  because the phone screener will hang up on me if you can't hear me right.  So I'm constantly, like, just doing shit I shouldn't be doing.  But, you know, I don't even have close calls.  I'm usually pretty good.  Yeah, I mean, I think the texting thing is kind of getting out of hand.  That's more of a majority thing.  Yeah.  It's more than just one or two dummies not being able to handle it.  It's a huge distraction when you're driving. 
[00:21:30]  That I understand.  And when you're on the LIE, it's our highway, obviously, of choice, and you see someone  going really slow either in the fast lane or the middle lane, you know every time that  they're on their fucking phone.  You go, you have to pass them around the right, and when you pass them on the right, you look  over, and it's either somebody who is ethnically challenged in the ways of driving, which I  will always, always blurt out an epithet to myself, you know, not to them, but I'll go,  Well, that figures, or someone just on that fucking phone, not even texting, sometimes 
[00:22:00]  just talking on the phone, they can't talk and fucking drive.  Right.  They have no concept of how fast or slow they're going.  Right.  Weaving in and out of lanes.  It's like, come on, I'm on a mission when I'm driving.  I want to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible.  You're in my fucking way.  Sure.  I never understand that.  You've got to use cruise control.  A what?  They've got to use cruise control.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, that ain't going to happen. 
[00:22:30]  Cruise control sucks a dick unless you're on an open highway and no one else is around.  You've got to be out in the Midwest.  There's always someone fucking up your cruise control.  You look and you're going, I think I, now this is slow, do I have this?  Am I meant to, ah, fuck, I'm getting closer.  You can tell you're getting closer.  It's just a matter of time.  You've got to fucking stop your cruise control.  You're like, I think I can change lanes.  There's someone next to me, but it's opening up.  It's going to be, ah, the brakes.  Exactly.  If you're driving on a highway in Montana or something.  Yeah, then you're fine.  You're rocking.  Open it up.  Getting back to that oral sex thing. 
[00:23:00]  Why can't that parent just have a conversation with the kid?  Oh, my God.  Why does it always have to be, oh, my God, I can't handle, you know, the word oral sex in  the dictionary.  My little kid's going to see that.  Why don't you sit down?  First of all, did the kid bring it to her attention?  Oh, who knows?  But why can't she sit the kid down and go, well, let's, you know, and have a conversation?  Because it's probably some puckered ass, hard right-liner Christian that just cannot even 
[00:23:30]  dream of talking to their children about sex.  And meanwhile, they're the kids that grow up to just turn into whores.  Sure, of course.  Like I said, years ago, there was a family, very Catholic upbringing.  The mother would look in the Catholic Digest to see if the movies we said we were going  to see were accepted by the Catholic Church.  No, no, there's a whole list that comes out.  Yeah, and she'd look through it and go, okay, you can go to this movie and move. 
[00:24:00]  We weren't going to a movie.  We should have been making fucking movies because the fucking that went on in that family, just  a bunch of daughters.  Really?  A bunch of fucking daughters and like one drugged out adopted son that wound up like old  Dean or something years ago.  But the girls were goers?  All the girls, hot and just fucking machines.  Nice.  Great.  And they were brought up so strict, just like such strict fucking Catholic upbringing. 
[00:24:30]  And they were the first ones to be like, let's go fucking grab some booze, go to one  of the local schoolyards in the summer by the woods and just fuck.  And she's got her bare back on just glass.  Oh, it's great.  No, I'd always bring like nice blankies.  Oh, you're one of the nice guys.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd have a blankie.  Not the crushed glass, laying in the crushed glass.  You don't even care.  The point it is. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, go to the point.  Nice.  Hey, that's fucking cool.  Yeah.  But I think you're right.  I think that's the case every time.  Who the fuck's doing the phones today?  Because I can't wait any longer to answer a fucking phone call.  Apparently phones are out in that room.  So what are they doing?  Mars is attempting to fix it right now.  Is he making those faces?  Yeah, he's very confused.  He puts his hands on his hips, his head draws back, and he goes like, ah, fuck. 
[00:25:30]  Nothing worse than hitting on a pretty good topic, having every single phone lit, and we can't continue our show.  He's resizing the screen right now.  Why is there always an issue?  I know why there's an issue.  Yeah.  Because they made this whole thing so goddamn complicated.  Well, they certainly did.  You know, go back to the old equipment.  No one had problems with the old equipment.  We don't need codes and two separate people turning keys just to turn a phone system on.  There's a difference between the old wooden push-button dial phone we had in one studio and this modern system that just is space-aged and plagued with fucking bugs. 
[00:26:00]  You know that if we had to make a phone call, we can't do it?  Yeah, yeah.  If, like, all of a sudden, like, all of a sudden I looked out the window, I'm like, oh, my God, a terrorist attack is going down right now.  I need to tell somebody.  Yeah.  And we have this huge phone system.  All I have to do is make a phone call.  A lot of people would die because I don't know how to make a phone call.  You have to get your cell phone out. 
[00:26:30]  Sure.  I guess, yeah.  I guess the cell phone would.  But let's say the cell phones, yeah, let's say they took out the cell towers.  Oh, my God.  So, there you go.  That's just wonderful.  Yeah.  Well, Mars is on it.  It'll be done by Ron and Fez's.  Tom.  Popped out again.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Tom?  Hey, man.  Hey, porn doesn't start in the dictionary.  It starts at the library, man.  When we were in Catholic school, we'd go whenever we had library time. 
[00:27:00]  We'd go right for the National Geographic collection.  Go look at the naked African and Mexican women.  And then we had out in town, Saturday and Sunday, a town in the city with your parents.  Walking through the city, the whole fucking guy, tie your shoe in front of the old newspaper  where all the porno matters were.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You stop.  Yeah.  Tie your shoe.  Absolutely.  You know what?  I think it's time for America to accept nudity, to accept sex, to accept porno.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  It seems like the rest of the world has embraced...  The rest of the world has embraced their sexuality, but for some reason in America, we're like  the biggest prudes.  It's so bizarre.  Sticks in the mud prudes.  Because we're a bunch of fucking parents.  The one thing that feels the best, we want to fucking deny each other.  Yeah, just cover it up.  We just want to deny each other.  That feeling.  And it's only because a few people get all freaked out about it.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  You should educate and blah, blah, blah.  But I mean, it's not a bad thing. 
[00:28:00]  Like, you know...  Sex isn't bad.  European beaches and stuff like that.  French Riviera, things like...  I mean, women walking around with just strings up their asses.  Right.  And tits just hanging out in the breeze.  Yeah.  And it's no big fucking deal.  Here, there'd be cops and, hey, you gotta cover that up.  And people complaining.  When you go to the beach and you see a girl going topless, which is legal, by the way,  and every once in a while there's a girl that's brave enough to do that.  Yeah.  Every guy loses their fucking mind. 
[00:28:30]  Like, holy shit, look at that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You're losing your fucking mind because you don't see it every day.  Keep peering over.  These European beaches, all the girls are going topless.  Have you ever seen videos or pictures?  And there's families and guys just going about their thing because it's normal to them.  Ooh.  It's normal to them.  Wow.  What do we got here?  All right, look.  Maybe I wouldn't be able to handle this.  What do we got here?  Oh, my God.  Okay, maybe this is a good idea.  This isn't happening really in numbers here. 
[00:29:00]  We are looking at a picture of two chicks just trotting through the surf up to about their ankles.  And the girl on the left has big melons.  Giant tits that are just perfectly placed.  And the other one has small, nice ones.  She's got small, nice ones.  They're wearing little bikini bottoms.  And the other one has kajunkas.  They're just walking around.  Okay, that would, I wouldn't be able to function on this beach.  No fucking no.  Yeah, but that's just, that's because of your entire life.  I'd have to lay on my stomach in the sand and dig a little hole for my wee-wee. 
[00:29:30]  So my wee-wee wouldn't hurt.  And then a crab would bite your head.  Found a friend, Harry.  Yeah.  Well.  Okay, maybe I understand.  Oh, my God, I'd lose my fucking shit.  Oh, yeah.  And Danny's just punching up nude beach pictures.  And they're, they're superb.  Look at the ass on that one.  Oh, my God.  Look at the ass.  Just stop it.  Second down on the left.  What about all the way to the right on the bottom?  No, that one. 
[00:30:00]  I want to see that chick.  Holy mother of tits.  Okay.  All right.  Maybe they got a point.  Now that would be, but we would get desensitized to it, would we ever?  I don't know.  We're just in a different place.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I would say we would never be desensitized to that.  My pee-pee would be going crazy.  My wiener.  I'd have to go in the cold water.  My penis would ache.  Yes.  My penis would ache from so many hard-ons.  My wee-wee would hurt. 
[00:30:30]  I'd pass out because I'd have no blood in my brain.  Yes.  Mark and PA, I'm just going to fucking answer these goddamn phone calls cold.  That's how good we are.  We don't need no fucking talent, coach.  Tell me what you got.  I don't even know what you want to fucking talk about.  Hey there, Mac.  I'm wondering if we're going to lose the cash cab because of that, you know, the Discovery  channel.  They do some crazy stuff.  Yeah, what kind of shit did they get away with, that cash cab?  Because he actually had to get a cabbie's license. 
[00:31:00]  He's doing a talk show in his cab.  I think the TLC.  A game show.  I think the TLC's going to have a problem with that.  You can't have...  I mean, a game show, sorry.  You can't have a Bluetooth in your ear, but you could run a game show in your fucking cab.  The guy makes a very valid point.  We know Ben Bailey, by the way.  He's a good guy.  Really good guy.  He does a good job with that show.  He's actually done our show a few times.  Yeah.  He's been too busy to do it lately, but we'll get him on.  He's got to have some good stories, though, with the drunk people.  They do that after dark now.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:31:30]  So that's got to be crazy.  I'd like to see where they start the game show, and then they have to stop it for some  fucked up reason.  You know, they ought to put out a DVD with all the bullshit that happens, where they  just got to throw people out and they puke or something.  That's what I want to see.  Let's see what happens in Cash Cab, the shit you don't see.  Where all of a sudden Ben Bailey wants to get Cash Cab going, and he looks to the back  seat and sees some guy getting blown.  You know there's some of that.  Turns those wacky lights on on the roof.  I was like, hey, wait a minute, I'm trying to get some head here. 
[00:32:00]  You ever get blown in a cab?  Let me think.  Not in a cab.  Limos.  You know, things like that.  Yeah, not me either.  Town car.  What number do you want?  One through nine, Ant.  Let's go with number seven.  Look at us.  Cold fucking answering.  Seven, please.  Oh, seven?  Sorry, six.  Oh, the six?  We're going to seven.  Why did you do that?  Hi, who's this?  Is this it?  Summer seven?  Yeah, what do you got, sir? 
[00:32:30]  What's your name, and what do you got?  Hey, I win.  I win.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  This is Dan from Knoxville.  All right.  Hi, Dan.  You better pull your chute quick.  These are all...  By the way, you're about to listen to all the people that never get through.  Yes, exactly.  You're about to learn what we have call screeners for.  That's why you do hear the same callers a lot.  We screen very well for this radio show.  It's very important.  Here you go, my friend.  I have the cold answer right now.  What do you got, brother? 
[00:33:00]  I was just going to tell you, I always hear about you all using your text, and if somebody  called you, you'd get pissed off.  I only got voicemail on my phone.  I did away with my text and internet, and I just hear you guys say, man, I couldn't get  by without all that stuff.  I don't even have a computer, so I don't know.  I just can't understand why it's so important to everybody.  You just wait for someone to call, you don't pick up, and then you listen to their voicemail?  Yeah.  Well, either if I'm awake or something, of course, the truck driving. 
[00:33:30]  I'll answer while I'm driving.  Of course, I don't think there's any problem when I'm driving.  No texting?  No texts, though?  I mean, yeah, like texting.  The whole world is texting.  Pretty important to me right now in my life.  Oh, my God.  Pretty important, the texting.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let me ask you, does a screen come up that's got actual words on it, or do you have to  actually type the word out letter by letter?  Letter by letter.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  No, I turn that shit off when they're trying to read my mind.  No, thank you.  I don't need to be trying to...  No, I like the iPhone.  It works very, very well. 
[00:34:00]  I don't fucking know.  It's frustrating.  You would freak out at how well it works on the iPhone.  Really?  Yes.  Maybe I should start using that iPhone.  I mean, I use it for the paper toss game, but...  I thought they'd have a screen, though, that had words like a and the, and before  or after, you know, just words you might use.  All right.  You know...  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You get it.  All right.  Pick another number, Ant.  This is how good we are.  All right.  Let's go with three, please. 
[00:34:30]  Hi.  Who's this?  Let's see.  Hello?  Hi.  What's your name?  Hi.  You're on the air with the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  What's your name?  This is what the screeners have to deal with every day, by the way.  Yeah.  Sir, what's your name?  Ah, shit.  What?  Can you hear us, dude?  On the phone?  All right.  Let's try one more, Ant.  This is what screeners are for.  Right.  This is a really good example. 
[00:35:00]  That's why you hear Jimmy James from New Hampshire and Fred from Brooklyn and who else?  Kevin from Connecticut.  Not Steve from Bayshore, because he sucks doing phone calls, but he's great with the fucking...  He's great with words, the written words.  Yeah, he's great with the written word, but he doesn't call the show.  The phone calls Chokemeister.  Sure.  What number?  One more.  One more.  He says, fuck you, Opie.  He knows it's true, though.  He knows it's true.  He knows it's true.  It hurts a little, doesn't it, Steve?  That's why he said, fuck you.  He would have just went, ha-ha, LOL. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  But he had to say that, because it hurts, because it's true.  Right.  And a note to Steve Blatter, you know, once again, our equipment's not working, and it's  kind of hurting our show, so...  It's hurting us.  Maybe we could figure some shit out.  We're hurting.  What number do you want, Ant?  Let's go with number one.  Let's go right to the top.  Uno.  Hi, who's this?  My number one?  You're number one.  You're number one.  Let her rip.  What's your name?  What's your name?  Where are you from?  What do you want?  This is Mike.  I'm in Michigan, and I got nothing.  I just wanted to be on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:36:00]  Okay.  That would have been a call.  The screener probably would have went, well, thank you for calling.  Click.  And you never would have heard from Mike saying you just wanted to be on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Let's run down the line.  Let's just go to two, then, or something.  All right.  You know, we'll go one to nine.  All right.  And then we'll take our first break.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, this is Bill.  Hi, Bill.  What do you got for the show?  Hi, Bill.  Hey, I got some good stuff for you. 
[00:36:30]  Okay.  First thing, I live in western New York, and just had a state trooper got killed down here  a couple last week.  And a female state trooper, and it was on the news.  They were making a big deal about it.  Yeah.  Two days later, they came out and said, she hit a tractor-trailer head-on on a two-lane  road.  Of course, you know, everyone said, oh, there's a tractor-trailer killed her.  No.  She was texting in the state trooper car and hit the truck head-on.  So it was the trooper's fault. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, she was texting while driving and hit a tractor-trailer head-on in the state trooper  car.  Is that the same story?  I think it's out of Buffalo.  Yeah.  Somebody caused an accident because they were watching or texting porn.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This is another one.  Oh, okay.  A girl hit a deer on just a couple days before Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  She hit a deer in her car, and the car became disabled on the thruway.  Yeah.  And a bunch of people were stopping to help her and pulling over and going around. 
[00:37:30]  A big tractor-trailer came along, ran the car right over with her in it.  Jesus.  What happened to the deer?  Well, the deer, they said, why couldn't you get off the car?  They said the car wouldn't start because it actually, you know, the deer, the mouse,  the front end.  Wow.  So the tractor-trailer, I mean, plowed this lady right over.  And everyone's like, you know, for the last two or three weeks, just been crucifying this 
[00:38:00]  truck driver.  But you didn't hear no story about it.  And I'm like, you know, I'm a truck driver, too.  I'm a truck driver, too.  Well, obviously.  Obviously, because you like to talk a lot.  Oh, my God.  Don't they like to talk?  I don't really like to get to the point.  Why get to the point when you have a lot of hours to kill on the highway?  He's just tearing up the pavement, O.P.  He's got roads and horizon in front of him.  In between way stations and fucking service areas.  There's a lot of lonely times.  Lonely roads just staring at them.  I'm on the road again.  White line fever.  Here I am. 
[00:38:30]  Anyway, so there's a guy.  Oh, my God.  There's not an anyway.  There's not an anyway.  Every trucker has an anyway.  Oh, God.  Yes.  And no wonder they kill hookers.  Yes.  All right.  No, go ahead.  Go ahead.  So the investigation comes to a head.  Because he's going to get to the porn part, which we all know by now.  The guy was right down the road with his laptop on a pay-per-view porn site as he ran the car over. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, my.  He was watching a porno movie driving down the road.  And you know, if you're watching a porn movie, that means you're also probably jacking.  So you're probably jacking.  I bet you're jacking.  Of course.  Thank you, sir.  Well, no.  Why would he be done?  There's a lot more highway ahead.  How many miles do you have to put in today, sir?  He's gone.  He finally left.  Maybe he hit an abutment.  Dude, that's only two.  We've got to get to nine. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, my God.  We've got to get to nine.  This is crazy.  If you're just tuning in, our phones got fucked up.  So we're just answering the calls cold like a phone screener would.  Giving you a little taste of what the phone screener deals with every morning on our show.  Hi, who's this?  Mike in Boston.  Mike?  Mike in Boston.  How are you, Mike?  Oh, too bad, boys.  How are you doing?  Good.  All righty.  What do you got for the show?  All righty.  I'm a service tech up in Boston here, and I always have a laptop with an air card on,  and I'm sitting here writing emails and shit while I drive. 
[00:40:00]  If that's bad, I don't know if that's bad, then I guess that's pretty bad, huh?  Yes, pretty bad.  Yes, that's bad.  That's really bad.  That was line three.  Trying to get to nine.  All right.  Hi, who's this?  Holy shit.  James.  Hi, James.  Where are you calling from?  Kansas.  Holy shit.  Here comes a bomb.  All right.  What do you got, man?  What the hell?  Let's see.  Let's see if we can get through this.  Yeah, the audience will be the judge.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  What do you got, James?  First of all, a few years ago when I started to listen to y'all, y'all were fucking still  with me.  So I want to say, fuck y'all for that, but I still love y'all.  I listen to you every day.  All right.  All right.  Good.  Legitimate.  I deliver pizzas, which is pretty fucking lame.  But if they ever told me that I couldn't have my XM, my GPS, my police scanner and everything  else, not to mention my pole, in my car, I would tell them to suck my dick and find  another job.  Did you say police scanner?  Yes, sir. 
[00:41:00]  Why do you need a police scanner in your pizza delivery?  Because it's fun to listen to what's going on out there.  Anthony, please.  I'm just like you.  I date teenagers, too.  Why do you think I have a fucking police scanner?  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  Enough said.  You know, but I think the reason we started the show off with what's going on in New York  City with the cabbies and how they took their Bluetooths away, their GPS, and their  satellite radio, this, unfortunately, will be something, a trend that starts. 
[00:41:30]  You're going to see this happening all over the place with other companies.  I'm telling you.  I'd like to see how they're going to enforce that satellite radio part of it, though, because,  you know, what the fuck?  Well, I don't know if local government, state government, what have you could enforce it,  but individual companies certainly can.  Oh, that's true.  Trucking companies, all of a sudden a big trucking company goes, you know what?  We're going to follow the lead of what's going on in New York City, and we're taking the  Bluetooths away from the truckers, their GPS, their CB radios. 
[00:42:00]  Well, if you took the CB away from the trucker, you're taking away his lifeline.  I hope to use the story for that.  How's he going to know where the Smokies are?  Right.  How are they going to tell you that there's a pretty seat cover?  But, I mean, there is a groundswell.  They're going to make laws so you can't text and drive at the same time.  Is there an actual law?  I don't even know.  Yeah, they're putting them in state by state.  And they're really going to enforce it.  And that's going to lead to them taking other things away that we have in our cars. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  All that stuff that we really like in our cars.  That made a car modern.  Right.  You know, you remember driving around with your parents and shit in a car that was nothing  to do.  Right.  Nothing.  Now there's just a bevy of fun things to do.  I'm kind of worried about that satellite radio a little bit.  Because it's not as complicated as the GPS when you start popping around.  But you do, yeah, it's a little more involved than just a regular AM, FM radio.  Yeah.  That's number four, Ant. 
[00:43:00]  Let's get to nine.  Nine.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, this is Phil.  Hi, Phil.  Where are you calling from?  North Carolina.  All right.  Everybody wants to move to North Carolina, Phil.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What I've talked about...  I love...  You know what I love about this show?  And I try it every day.  Just a little small talk.  Yeah, a little small talk.  I try a little small talk just to make it feel like we're human beings just chatting.  And then you just get blown off.  I get blown off.  I mean...  A lot of people want to move... 
[00:43:30]  They just want to get to their point.  Maybe because they're nervous.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah.  Phil, why can't we have a little small talk about North Carolina?  Oh, okay.  I just didn't want to chatter too long, take too long to get to my point.  All right.  And you hang up on me.  That's all right.  All right.  I'm in the mountains, man.  It's beautiful.  All right.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe that small talk is overrated.  What do you got there, Phil?  I want to talk about distracted driving.  I pass cops all the time.  They got that stupid computer screen open, riding down the road, typing in on it. 
[00:44:00]  If that's not distracted driving, I don't know what is.  Well, I mean, yeah.  The troopers and the cops are doing exactly what we're doing, but they're supposed to  pull us over for doing what they're doing.  Yeah.  Well, they're typing in license plate numbers of cars in front of them.  Yeah, but that nice screen could do some other things, too.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  You could do some things with that.  Oh, yeah.  That episode where the airline pilots were on their laptops and overshot the airport.  So, you could even get to that level and be distracted when you miss an entire airport. 
[00:44:30]  But that made me feel good.  It scared the shit out of everybody else, but it made me think, wow, you know, they got  this flying thing down if the two pilots could overshoot a runway by 100 miles.  And the plane's just going.  And no one knows for 100 miles.  The plane's just going.  That's nice.  Playing online poker.  All right.  Let's go to line six, trying to get to nine.  Hi.  This is Bill the Trucker.  Another trucker.  Oh, how are you doing there?  Oh, shit.  Hi, Bill.  I'm doing fine.  First of all, I don't have a fucking southern accent. 
[00:45:00]  So, that helps.  As for the CB radio.  Slight.  Slight southern accent, sir.  Slight.  Yeah, it's there.  A little bit.  Well, I was born in Queens, grew up down south, and realized it's a hillbilly hill and came  back.  Right.  For the CB radio, I will gift wrap that motherfucker and send it to you.  It's not worth sticking underneath the tire of the truck for a shock.  It's worthless.  Plus, it's just dumb hillbillies going back, shit up, stupid. 
[00:45:30]  Things haven't changed since the 70s, apparently.  A lot of truckers going, get her done.  Shit up, stupid.  Get her done.  The only reason it exists in my trucks, if you're at a grocery warehouse, they'll call  you to, you know, park your truck in a particular door for unloading.  Beyond that, I have no use for it.  Yeah, you don't get smoky reports.  You don't get those hot truckers playing with themselves.  Fuck that.  I wouldn't fuck a trucker with your dick, Anthony.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  That old gag. 
[00:46:00]  Lady truckers aren't known for their outstanding beauty.  We've all used that joke at least once in our lifetime, but it really doesn't make sense.  How do you fuck abroad with someone else's dick?  How true.  How true.  How do you get that done?  Yeah.  Oh, this would appeal to you.  Okay.  The constitutionality of the trucker they called in before about truckers being prohibited from  texting.  That went into effect on Wednesday.  That is a rule that went through by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. 
[00:46:30]  No constitutionality, no hearings, no comment period.  Boom.  They said it's not going to happen.  Boom.  The workers cannot do it.  Now, where's the constitutionality of law behind that to dispute or comment on anything?  I thought you'd like that, O.  Excuse me, Anthony.  Yeah, it's more Anthony, I guess.  Well, no, I mean, that concerns me as well.  Yeah, yeah.  You can just push it through like that.  I would comment on that, but I was paying no attention.  Why?  What happened? 
[00:47:00]  Porn?  No, no.  He just kind of lost me.  They took and they passed this rule out.  No, no, you don't have to do it again.  That's okay.  I'll listen to the replay, and I'll comment to myself.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  One other quick thing.  Yes.  Another trucker, of course.  There's always one more thing.  Oh, Francois.  Sorry.  Okay.  Trying to get to nine, Anthony.  We're up to line seven.  Seven, please.  Hi.  Who's this? 
[00:47:30]  Hello, guys.  This is Chip the Trucker.  Chip, you fuck.  Hey, what's up?  You know, the reason we get in so many accidents is because we talk so much, and it just takes  us forever to text, so we never see the road.  Here's a prime example.  What number was this?  A seven.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We crapped out.  Doing Jimmy's.  No, he's trying to do Jimmy's.  Booyah.  I understand.  You're trying to do Jimmy's bid, but you have to start with the.  Yes. 
[00:48:00]  That's how the impression.  All right.  Go ahead.  Give me a poke, does a what.  Go ahead.  He's gone.  Trying to get to nine.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is line eight, Anthony.  All right.  Line eight.  Hello?  Hi.  We on line eight?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right.  Oh, I had to make sure.  Truck driver, please.  Once again, reading the truck driver thing here, we can be fined.  It's a civil or criminal penalty up to $2,750, which the irony, it's on a Qualcomm system 
[00:48:30]  that you can read going down the road.  But yeah, that driver was talking about it being actually going to effect.  Yes, it is.  It is an actual criminal and civil penalty and everything else, what they're talking  about.  And that's true for the texting while driving in a commercial vehicle or a bus.  I mean, I'm going to still text, even if it's law, obviously.  Yeah, everybody is.  I do think that texting is becoming a bit of an issue.  I really do.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess D.C., someone on, I guess the phones are starting to work, because Greg 
[00:49:00]  in D.C., he says, in D.C., law says no texting, but email is okay.  Email?  Well, because texting, you're doing a conversation.  It's back and forth.  It's not a one and done.  An email is kind of one and done.  Yeah.  So you can sneak an email in, like, all right, I'll get back to you on this.  Reply to the email.  Right, right, right.  I'll be at the meeting.  But texting is a conversation.  Yeah.  You don't just text once.  It's at least a little bit of a back and forth.  You're using words.  Yeah.  All right, sir, thank you. 
[00:49:30]  We're getting to the final one.  Thank God.  But look how good we are.  We had a major issue, and we made something fun out of it.  We just got to plow through.  Hi, who's this?  This is Robin, Detroit.  See, now she's a regular.  This is Robin from Detroit.  Yeah, I made it through.  Is it cold in the day?  Excuse me?  Is it cold in the day?  It's wintertime.  Oh, it's fucking cold.  It sucks.  See, this is a small talk I like to do every once in a while.  I know.  We got 17 degrees here in New York today. 
[00:50:00]  That's cold for us.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not what we've got, too.  Yeah.  That's small talk.  That's nice.  It's nice.  I was nice.  It's nice.  It's like we're having coffee, just chit-chatting a little bit.  No problem with that right there.  And then we do something serious.  What do you got, Robin?  I'm calling about the dictionary thing.  Yeah.  Do you think if my 16-year-old son wanted to know what oral sex is, he couldn't go on  the Internet?  Do you think he'd pick up a dictionary?  Well, that's why the whole thing is completely ridiculous.  Thank you, Robin.  What do you think he'd pick up on the Internet?  Dictionaries out of all the schools in that district is ridiculous. 
[00:50:30]  What do you think your kids are doing while both parents are working?  The intranets.  Yeah, of course they are.  Well, I don't think my kids even fucking ever looked at a dictionary.  They got the Internet.  Who gives a shit about a dictionary?  That is a great point.  I got a lot of nephews and nieces.  I'm going to ask them.  I don't think they're fucking looking through dictionaries.  It's the last time you flipped through a fucking dictionary.  Yeah, they're getting all their info and research shit online.  Or the Encyclopedia Britannica.  Hell yeah.  I'd probably be appalled if I know what my 16-year-old son's been looking at on the Internet. 
[00:51:00]  A 16-year-old?  Forget about it.  Oh, my God.  He's jacking to everything.  I don't even want to know.  He's probably seen things I haven't seen.  But, you know, fuck the dictionary.  Those people are crazy.  I'm jealous of these fucking 16-year-olds.  You know how hard we had to work to get our excitement?  The excitement they must feel punching up the porno that Danny just put tits in Google.  And there's tits galore.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Danny just put tits in, right? 
[00:51:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm looking at one, two, three, four, five, ten.  Second row all the way to the left.  No, no, no.  I don't even want to do that.  You could have an individual jacks session with every single one of those pictures.  Yes.  Put oral sex in there.  Well, all right, Robin.  We will.  Oral sex.  Oral sex.  Oh, my God.  You know something?  God damn.  Now, if we could all...  Bottom row, second from the last.  Yeah, with the eyes.  With the big eyes looking up at...  The big eyes.  I just had big eyes looking up at me. 
[00:52:00]  Dude, let me explain something.  If we could all just reach back for a moment and remember, remember what it was like at  16 in your teens to just pick up a fucking dirty magazine and flip through it and see  that the excitement, the adrenaline rush, the fucking whoosh in your stomach.  Hold on, Ant.  I understand what you're saying, but I got to slow you down a little bit because I want  to try something even different.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Danny popped in oral sex.  Yeah.  It took a split second to have...  Oh, my God.  ...15 amazing oral sex pictures up there.  Yeah.  And if you were a 16-year-old kid, you could jack to any one of those, right?  Oh, please.  What would it take...  I can jack right now.  I am.  What would it take for us at 16 to get what Danny got in a split second?  For real.  You're in your house.  Right.  And you want to jack off.  Yeah.  The 16-year-old today goes, oral sex, boom.  He's got his...  Seconds, you have it.  He's rocking. 
[00:53:00]  And now, you would have to...  But what would happen if it was us?  All right.  You worked up.  You want a little jack.  You need some fucking porn.  You would have to go...  Just search out, like, your parents' fucking stash.  Or if they don't have any, then you've got to search out, like, catalogs that have bra  ads.  I started going through my dad's stuff hoping that he was some kind of pervert with something.  Yeah.  I did find, like, a naked picture of Marilyn Monroe. 
[00:53:30]  That first picture.  That was in one of the first Playboys.  Jack.  He had that.  Did I jack to that?  I don't remember, to be honest with you, on that one.  Oh, yes, Rob.  Yes?  I'm the same age as you are, and I can honestly tell you, I don't think I saw a dick until  I was 14.  I think I probably would have seen one by then if I had the internet.  See?  Yes.  The girls didn't have booby magazines.  You didn't see a dick when you were that age.  You saw a dick at 14?  I'm saying I probably didn't see one until then, because you guys are looking at bra catalogs 
[00:54:00]  and shit.  You've got no dick pictures.  I understand what she's saying.  Oh, she's even in a worse boat.  She wasn't a slut at 14.  She didn't even see a picture of a dick until she was 14.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We were able to see boobies and stuff probably before.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely before 14.  That's true.  I got nothing.  Then I would go to the local stationery, and I'd just start stealing the porn magazines.  Porno.  But even that, what are you getting?  But that took a long time.  A nude woman, you're not getting hardcore. 
[00:54:30]  But that took a long time.  Yeah.  And then, because I used to deliver papers, my best secret was that I would wait for garbage  day.  And you know the freaking tied up newspapers?  Bundles of newspapers?  Recycling?  Dude, I would go with a little knife or something.  I don't remember if it was a knife or a scissor.  Yeah.  And I would just comb the neighborhood, and you would see the stack of newspapers and  magazines all bundled up.  And then in the middle.  And I would just like, yeah, I would just cut the rope or whatever they were using. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And every, I'm not saying it happened a lot, but every once in a while, you would find  a gold mine, someone throwing out their old magazines.  You weren't, and you weren't getting like oral sex like you do on the internet.  If you just got a naked chick picture, it was great.  But I could still have a good time with just the, you know what I mean?  I don't need it to get too crazy still.  I know, but you could go from, you know, just a scantily clad girl to hardcore fucking 
[00:55:30]  choking blowjob videos.  You know?  It runs the gamut.  Yeah.  Well, I hope you guys have a great day.  I haven't talked to you in a while, but.  Yeah, Robin, you doing all right up there?  Is the economy turning around in Detroit at all?  Turn around.  Um, no, this place is going down the shitter butt quick.  And you know, you're talking about texting and driving.  Maybe they shouldn't be driving fucking Toyotas on the road either.  Well, Toyota had one of its worst years since, um.  And they got a, I believe.  And they got an accelerator that's sticking? 
[00:56:00]  Is that the issue?  Yeah.  I mean, I think 15 people have died.  I don't see them pulling them off the road.  Well, they're recalling and trying to replace these gas pedals that are sticking.  Ford, though, and the auto industry in general, had an uptick.  That's what they, uh, so it's kind of coming back a little bit.  But, yeah, Toyota is really in some trouble.  Wow.  Yeah, but they're more dangerous than texting at this point.  They killed four people in one day at Christmas time.  One, one, they were talking to one guy that had an issue with it.  And he said, uh, the guy, he just started accelerating down the road.  Stepped on the brake, wasn't slowing the car down. 
[00:56:30]  So he threw it into neutral and then kept going from neutral to drive to just kind of ease his way off the road.  It's like, okay, there's a smart guy.  Yeah, but most of us would just be screaming and panicking and...  I never understand this.  I was going to mention this before.  The car, unless you're in dead stop traffic and your car dies,  I don't understand the car stalled in the left or middle lane or the right lane.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Like, I don't understand it. 
[00:57:00]  Of course.  There's momentum.  Of course.  Your car is still...  It doesn't just stop on a dime like that.  It's the idiot that's going, what's wrong with my vehicle?  And staying where they are instead of right when there's a problem, get the fuck off the road.  That's your primary thing is look and get to the fucking right and get off the road.  Yeah, yeah.  When I see a stalled vehicle in the middle lane, I want to fucking rear end them.  Swear to God.  You have plenty of time to move over.  Plenty of time.  You're doing fucking at least 50 miles an hour when you notice there's a problem. 
[00:57:30]  Now, use your fucking kinetic energy to get the fuck off the road.  Bravo, Anthony.  Yes, thank you.  Good job, Anthony.  Thank you, miss.  All right, Robin.  I hope you get finger popped this weekend.  Have a good one, all right?  Okay, thanks.  All right.  It just goes, okay, thanks.  Okay, thanks.  Well, she agrees.  She's hoping for a good finger popping herself.  That's my new favorite term for some reason.  Finger popping?  I don't know why.  Sounds fun. 
[00:58:00]  Sounds like a party favor.  Let's go to Kate in Boston.  Now, the phones are back.  Now, we can kind of do our job.  Although, that little exercise was fun, too.  Yeah.  Kate, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I listen to you guys almost every morning, so good morning to you.  Good morning, Kate.  Yeah, I was just listening, and I randomly look up shit all the time on Google, and I popped  in oral sex, and I thought it was freaking hilarious.  It actually has, on Wikipedia, if you go to it, it has a picture of a guy and a chick actually 
[00:58:30]  giving the guy oral sex.  Ah.  And it pretty much shows you, it tells you everything, like the history and everything.  And then if you go to a little drawing, it goes up behavioral aspects, blowjob, and tips  and attitude.  And there's just so much freaking links and stuff.  It just, it cracks me up.  That's a lot of information on oral sex.  Oh, look at that.  There's an old Victorian painting of this woman in complete Victorian garb lifting it up. 
[00:59:00]  Her hairy bush is there.  It's a painting.  And there's a gentleman.  Is it a jester?  He is a gentleman wearing his Victorian garb, just licking her snatch behind a curtain, taking  a quick lick of her snatch.  That's pretty brave for the Victorian age, man.  Oh my God, she is.  What the fuck?  And they're looking out, like, look out if somebody comes past this curtain. 
[00:59:30]  Why did Wikipedia choose that picture?  That's a great picture.  To help educate people about oral sex.  What is that one?  Oh my God.  You gotta go to Wikipedia and type in oral sex.  It's very entertaining.  That is a good one.  Yes.  And I type in, like, all kinds of crap all the time, and Wikipedia has so much crap.  It's unbelievable.  There's no need for a goddamn dictionary, and these people are freaking stupid, and I want  to smack every single one of them.  We're now looking at a drawing.  Yes, it's like cartoony. 
[01:00:00]  I had a friend in high school that could fucking...  He made a living in my high school drawing naked chicks and giving it to us.  Yeah, we had one of those guys, too.  But it was so realistic what he could do.  Very hot.  And he had a nice little business going for himself.  Entrepreneur.  Very nice.  Well, thank you, Kate.  Thanks for turning us on to that.  We're going to probably study this a little bit, because I think there's some funny stuff  in there.  Taboo.  Oh, there definitely is.  And I know Jimmy is not there, but love you, Jim. 
[01:00:30]  Fuck Jimmy.  Aww.  Aww.  Now, where's Jimmy going to be this weekend?  Uh-huh?  Where's he going to be this weekend?  Um, honestly, I don't know.  Richmond?  Because he messed up the plugs a little bit this week.  Was it?  Yeah.  He'll do fine.  We'll get a Jimmy plug.  Oh, Virginia.  Thank you, Kate.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good morning.  Oh, you too.  Bye.  Bye.  Toyota told 80-year-old woman to just...  All right, yeah.  Let's go to this one.  Tom in Jersey.  Hey, how are you doing, boys?  Hey. 
[01:01:00]  I have...  My mother-in-law's aunt is like 80 years old, and she has one of the brand-new 2009-2010  Toyotas.  And she said that the accelerator sticks and brings it up to 90.  Nice.  And so she called them up, and all they said was, we can't do anything for you.  Sorry.  The dealership won't call.  Won't answer the phone.  And they tell her, just put it in neutral and slam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Yeah, they had a sting operation here in New York where they went into a dealership and  tried to buy a car, and the guy said, yeah, no, they're fine. 
[01:01:30]  They're all fine.  Yeah.  No, those are the older cars.  Meanwhile, they're not.  No, of course not.  No, but I mean, how do you tell an 80-year-old woman that?  Yeah.  That's fine if you're on a highway and you don't have anything in front of you, but  an 80-year-old can have that kind of stuff?  They can't drive like perfect cars.  Yeah.  That's slamming into something.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you very much.  I'm punching out.  Yeah, thank you.  A couple more calls, then we're going to take our first break.  Scott in Tampa.  Scott.  Morning, boys.  Watch out for Pete Townsend. 
[01:02:00]  You're close enough.  Oh.  Thanks.  Tampa is close enough to Miami.  That fucking kid toucher's down there.  Is he?  Aren't they alerting the area that Pete Townsend's in town?  They probably have to.  I think we have the article in the paper.  We'll get to it after the break.  We're going to use my Predator app on my iPhone and see if a red dot appears.  And see if the Who logo pops up.  Click on it and see if it's Pete Townsend.  Yeah.  See if it plays Rough Boys.  Now we know what Rough Boys is all about.  Yes.  Did you like the solo Pete Townsend stuff, Ant? 
[01:02:30]  Some of it was.  See, this is Ant and I doing a little chit-chat.  Some of it was okay for the time.  Now it seems pretty dated and a little hokey.  What are some of those Pete Townsend solo tracks?  I'm trying to remember now.  Some of them Pete Townsend solo tracks.  Rough Boys and I can't even think of another one right now.  Scott, what do you got?  No, no, no.  Well, you know, you guys were talking about using a dictionary to look for oral sex.  I caught my boy on Craigslist looking at hookers.  And he's 16 years old.  He was jacking it. 
[01:03:00]  So what do they need a dictionary for?  Now, as a father, and you see your son jacking to hookers on Craigslist, does that bother you at all?  Nah, not really.  I was just wondering where he got the $150 if he was really going to be able to afford one.  Maybe he was just getting off just looking at the fact that he could possibly, you know, get these girls.  Well, it was on my computer and...  Oh, that's what you're telling the wife.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  He's gone.  Yeah, now he's like, fuck.  Blow up my spot.  Let's, one more.  Craig the Trucker.  Craig.  Craig.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  I, uh, going back to the nude beach thing.  I was, uh, stationed in Germany.  Yeah.  And went to a couple, uh, nude beaches out there.  And I ended up getting a ticket for having a hard-on.  How do they write that one up?  Well, you're out there stark naked. 
[01:04:00]  And, uh, you know, things happen.  I mean, how is it written?  Like, uh, you can't just say hard-on.  Uh, well, uh, indecent exposure.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Yeah.  And it...  So it's not indecent if it's not hard?  Yeah, limp dick is fine.  Limp dick is fine?  The second you get a boner, uh...  Now we got a problem?  Yeah.  All right.  Exactly.  Well, thank you, Craig.  Uh, by the way...  All right.  ...Kevin from Connecticut, you wise-ass.  I know Tampa's, like, 280 miles from Miami. 
[01:04:30]  My God, it's closer than London.  What I'm trying to say is it's close enough.  Yay.  We'll do a little break.  Oh, and, um...  A little break-ski.  Actually, I'm kind of surprised.  You know Stalker Patty did that Kesha song yesterday?  Yes.  Uh, I posted it on, uh, the YouTube channel there, OP Radio.  Mm-hmm.  It's doing really fucking well.  Is it really?  Because basically, I took the angle, you can make anyone into a pop star.  And people are really fucking digging the fact that Stalker Patty didn't know this song, 
[01:05:00]  heard it a few times, and within a couple hours, they made it sound pretty damn fucking good.  Did you put pictures of her up there, too?  Pictures of her.  Oh, great.  Some, uh, some annotations or whatever the fuck they call them.  Ah, yes.  And it's doing really well, so the video's up there, but, uh, I want to play it for the radio audience as well.  Yes.  There's not, there's really not a laugh in here.  No, it's...  So don't be confused.  When, like, when Bobo and Club Soda Kenny, like, sing the pop songs, it's a goof and there's a laugh in there. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  This is basically an exercise to show you that it's all bullshit what these pop stars are doing, including Britney Spears.  Oh, yeah, for years.  You know the difference, like, a Lady Gaga, I think she truly does have talent as far as being a pop star goes.  But then you got, uh, I'll go right back to it, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus.  Yeah.  They don't have any real talent.  They're, they're created in the, in, uh, in the studio, especially with this auto-tune. 
[01:06:00]  Yep.  The auto-tune is the, the bane of the musical existence.  Right, and so, what you're about to hear is Stalker Patty, it's one of the hottest songs in America.  Keisha, or Kesha, doing TikTok.  Yeah.  Uh, TikTok.  Patty only heard this song a few times, tried it in, in, in the production, uh, studio.  We didn't have all day to, to, you know.  No.  This is a...  To spend on this.  One and done.  And then they, then they, then Troy fucked around with auto-tune and some other shit.  And, and it sounded like this, so check it out. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know how much we're going to play out of it, but we'll, we'll at least start the song.  Wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy.  What up, girl?  Wear my glasses out the door, I'm gonna hit this city.  What up, girl?  When I eat brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack, cause when I eat for the night, I ain't coming back.  I'm talking, thank you're on your toes, toes, trying not pull up those clothes, boys, slowing up our phones, phones.  The job's talking, playing the favorite CDs, pulling up to the parties, trying to get a little bit tipsy. 
[01:07:00]  Don't stop making pop, DJ blow my sneakers up tonight.  I'm a bike, like Joey Seaton's got a light.  Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop.  No, no, no.  Don't stop making pop, DJ blow my sneakers up tonight.  I'm a bike, like Joey Seaton's got a light. 
[01:07:30]  Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop.  No, no.  Ain't a lot of care in the world.  Checking out the O.P. and Anthony Jiu  Never a big fan of cake  Really?

[01:16:00]  Like you know  Oh it's from a lottery  Or something  So  Right  I'm like alright  This is a scam  They're trying to get me  And I'm looking over the whole thing  And you're like  I can't find the scam  Right  How the heck can I not find the scam  And then I realize  No this is a real fucking form  Wait you're dealing with  Oh you're dealing with the feds  I thought you were dealing with fez  No no no  I thought you were dealing with the fez  No the fez is different  Oh  You can send the fez over there  But not  See  I don't think the fez would work out like the feds 
[01:16:30]  Oh  See I deal with the fez  Oh  No  And then I'm looking at the dates  Sounds stressed I guess it might be  Alright  I'm looking at the dates when these things are cashed  Yeah  And it's when I was on vacation in Orlando  So I was nowhere even near this path mark  Are you involved in racketeering yet?  I don't think you're going to find that out  Racketeering  Someone's going to be in trouble  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[01:17:00]  Now there's allegations that it's Opie's extended family  Yeah I was going to kind of make that joke  But then I decided not to go there  Oh Jesus  Yeah  Yeah  No it's  Yeah  There are  There are  Cameras and things  There's  Oh there are ways to  To see who  Who perpetrated this  Who is eating a salad at 7.45 in the morning  That's me  That's lunch food  No salad good  Do you have a little chicken in there at least?  Yes  Alright  There's chicken 
[01:17:30]  There's chicken  Alphamic  Vinaigrette  No one says chicken better than Jay Moore  Chicken  He's imitating his mother  Chicken  Do you want some chicken?  Chicken  Chicken  Still makes me laugh to this day  Alright what are we doing?  We did a little cake  We did a little fed talk  We did a little salad talk  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  Salad talk  Sam's in studio  Salad talk  Well I guess we're going to talk about Nick Cannon a little more  Yeah  Now I got some top secret information yesterday 
[01:18:00]  And it's funny because another high powered show happened to get the top secret information  After we talked about it on our show  On our show  But he'll be the first to accuse everybody of ripping him off  And when I tell you my source is so deep within the organization  I can't even tell you Anthony  Yeah  And we learned that this Nick Cannon  Who now does mornings where we used to do mornings on regular radio  They hired a talent coach  A talent coach 
[01:18:30]  So they hired another radio guy that has no experience thinking it's going to work  They realized within a week  Holy shit we're in deep trouble  We got to get a talent coach for this guy to teach him how to do radio  A talent coach?  And with that said  Sam has just handed us a pamphlet on the talent coach  It's a packet  It's a packet  Wow  It's a packet  You know what kind of money this would probably cost?  I  Who is the talent coach?  It's a group right?  It's the Reynolds group?  Yeah it's the Reynolds group 
[01:19:00]  Love their rap  And CBS Radio hired the Reynolds group to work with Nick Cannon to teach him how to do morning radio right?  Yeah and it's one of these guys he runs it and it's exactly what you guys have talked about  Right  It's the guy who says he used to do a morning show so he can relate to the talent  Oh another guy that used to do a morning show understands  Let me tell you about the guys that used to do morning shows  They failed miserably so now what they have decided I'm going to teach other people how to fail miserably  Yes  I'm going to make more failures 
[01:19:30]  No one wants to be a talent coach if they can have a successful morning show  You'd rather have a successful morning show than be a talent coach  That's why this will never work for anybody  Is this the coach?  That's him  What's his name?  He looks like a laugh riot  What's this douche's name?  Something Reynolds  I probably worked with him  Probably  He said having done a morning show gives me insight on how personalities think and what motivates them each day  Personnel  This unique perspective allows me to bond with and talk to shows in ways that helps them grow quickly 
[01:20:00]  Oh really?  Yeah  Alright and what is this?  He's bragging about the Nick Cannon prank phone call?  Well the thing is he lists all the  Now we played the Nick Cannon prank phone call  Mariah Carey pranked her wife's radio show  This Nick Cannon  And made believe what?  She was into porn or something  And she was a Long Island broad  She pretended she was Debbie from Long Island  And she really pulled the wool over Nick Cannon's eyes  Oh it was a scream  The prank phone call was horrendous 
[01:20:30]  Well  It was horrible  Looks like it was  And it went on way too fucking long  Looks like it was the talent coach's idea  And there was no point to the prank call by the way  Well yes  But the talent coach came up with this brilliant idea for Nick Cannon's morning show right?  Yes because on his website he's got all the bits from different shows that he's worked for  He has worked for a lot of shows in a lot of major markets  And this is one  He takes credit for this bit  Which would lead me to believe that maybe there was something set up about it 
[01:21:00]  So the talent coach describes Nick Cannon's prank phone call  Yeah  And he writes this on the website so other people could hire him as a talent coach I guess  Correct  Nick Cannon  New morning guy  92.3 now in New York  Was chatting with listeners about using porn in their relationships  When he gets a call from Debbie from Long Island  Who's all for it  Even claiming that she and her husband use it to make the relationship better  Great content breaks are strategic 
[01:21:30]  They're fun  Relevant  And build the host character by communicating something  What happens strategically here really is revealed at the end of the call  The listener is actually Mariah Carey  Are you shitting me  Nick's wife who called to prank him  Are you shitting me that they are actually looking at that like it was a great thing  A great success and an example  A great success  Yes  A great success  I talked to a morning show host in New York 
[01:22:00]  Who worked with him  And he said basically that he just comes in and teaches radio one on one  And tells them to keep their talk breaks to two minutes  And then you know get back to the music  Yeah  Which I guess is a better way to get your point across  I don't know why you guys keep  I was thinking  I was listening to the first break  It was a little lengthy  In the phone call bit  Maybe if you could  Oh  Cut it down to like two minutes in length  Wow  Yeah that'll happen Sam 
[01:22:30]  Yeah we'll listen to you  Okay  You're so fired for suggesting that  I've worked with talent before  So I know how to relate  Yes  So this talent coach  He's bragging about that  I would call it for real  A mediocre average prank phone call that Nick Cannon did on his show  Yeah but it had Mariah Carey involved  Who gives a shit  Okay that's another  Who gives a flying fuck  Okay that's one  Flying  I love the flying fuck 
[01:23:00]  And then there's a bio on this talent coach Anthony  The Reynolds group  He's worked with Detroit's Mojo in the morning  What did he do for Mojo in the morning?  He got him really pumping  He's also worked with Philadelphia's Tiffany and Michael  Yes  I heard Bob Kelly's here  And look my salad is not the least bit worried  Poor Bobby  He doesn't eat salads 
[01:23:30]  If that was a donut man  It would have ran away like a cockroach  I know  He also worked with New York's Hot 97's  Cypher Sounds  Cypher  Cyphilis?  Cypher Sounds  What's Cypher Sounds?  That's his name  Cypher Sounds and Rosenberg?  Yeah Cypher Sounds and P. Rosenberg  They're the Hot 97 Morning Team  Way to list a bunch of shows that have never done shit  Yeah what the fuck  Cypher Sounds  He's also worked with Chicago's Jay Nice and Julian  Oh okay  No I have  What? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah that show is just  Taking Chicago by storm  Oh is that them right there?  And Boston's Carson and Kennedy  We feature them on Jocktober  Oh my god  No fucking way we did  They're horrendous  Yeah  They were part of Jocktober?  Yeah they were  And then he lists  And more  These are the big names  That this guy's hoping people recognize  In the business  I mean he's gone down to  He's gone down to Des Moines  He's gone all over the place  Des Moines?  Yeah  Did you just say Des Moines?  You could say Des Moines 
[01:24:30]  It's Des Moines  Well I left the first S  Oh Des Moines  The S's are kind of like silent  In that weird fucking city  Never an S in Des Moines  It's not Des Moines  Des Moines  Des Moines  You're hysterical  You're stupid  Okay  I like the first one  Oh okay  And then here's his statement  Oh he's got a  What like a mission statement  A mission statement  Yeah for this  Frank Reynolds  I'm being told  Frank Reynolds  His talent coach  Was a top 40 show 
[01:25:00]  Alright  Like to find some of his  Like I said yesterday  I've been on radio  About 25 years now  I've never heard of Frank Reynolds  And his stupid morning show  So why is he telling other people  How to do a morning show?  How are his chops?  How are his radio chops?  Right  Obviously very good  Here's his mission statement  Though Anthony  Affirming and growing  Positive images  Of being real  Innovative  And fun  If centered around  A show content strategy  What?  What does that mean?  Again this is  Copy and pasted  So things that are hard to read 
[01:25:30]  And grammatically inaccurate  Is just from the website  Okay  Affirming and growing  Positive images  Of being real  Innovative  And fun  If centered around  If centered around  A show content strategy  Is what the Reynolds group  Does  What does the Reynolds group do?  Does for  It shows each week  And in each market visit  Affirming and growing  Positive images  Of being real  Innovative  And fun  If  Centered around 
[01:26:00]  A show content strategy  Alright so you need  What a fucking loser  Content  I don't even understand  What this means  Alright alright  You need the show content  To revolve around  Positive images  Yeah  Of being real  And innovative  And fun  Yeah  That's what  And it's  That is all centered around  A show content  What?  Well I think it's also important  One of the strategies  Would be  I understand this guy  I think we should all  Get together before  Monday  And say to our 
[01:26:30]  What  Is  The Opie and Anthony show  You better hope  You're still allowed  To be here  Why?  What is?  You better hope  Your key card works  Monday  Why wouldn't it?  I'm just saying  If we figure out  What is  The Opie and Anthony show  Say that again Sam  Because I didn't understand you  I was saying that  Before Monday's show  Yeah  We should all get together  As a group  Yeah  And figure out  What the Opie and Anthony show  Is  And come up with something  That we can bring 
[01:27:00]  To the audience  What do you do for a living?  Character?  Okay  What do you do for a living?  Character?  I work here  Character?  Character?  Actually Sam  Yeah  That is sound advice  Thank you  I'll go home and get your  Fucking shine box  Well I know  I'm thinking that you  Weren't being serious  His mission statement  Sucks a dick  It's a corporate  It's corporate bullshit  Corporate fucking  Double speak babble  He's got a collar and a tie  And this is what's great  And please Sam  The Reynolds group 
[01:27:30]  I guess his name's  Frank Reynolds  He brags that he used  To do a morning show  Find his shit online  I'm going to  Having done a morning show  Also gives me insight  On how personalities think  And what motivates them  Each day  Yeah  This unique perspective  Allows me to bond with  And talk to shows  In ways that helps them  Grow quickly  Oh  That's what he needs  He's been there  Is what he's saying  He knows how to do  A morning show  He's been there  He walks  He walks the walk  He doesn't just  Talk the talk  Exactly 
[01:28:00]  Yes  If he wanted to do  A morning show  Does he  He could take it over  Does he  But instead he wants  To help others  How much money  Is stupid ass CBS  Forking over to this  This guy  To teach Nick Cannon  Nick Cannon  How to do radio  Well I printed out  Some tips  That he  I see that  And I figured  I could help you guys  I guess if you  Hire this guy  If you hire this guy  I guess he'll give you  A list of hot topics 
[01:28:30]  Oh is that it  You can't find those  Wait to  Wait to hear the hot topics  This is the hot topics  This week  You know what  Now this is stuff  You can't find  On your own  Alright  I want to  I want to do  A little exercise  Clear the phones  And I know you guys  Have a lot of great stuff  Clear the field  Clear the phones  This stupid Frank Reynolds  From the Reynolds group  Yeah  If you're doing a morning show  He's going to give you  A list of hot topics  I guess  Does he update the list  Almost daily  It's once a week  He updates the free list  Once a week 
[01:29:00]  I'm sure if you pay  For his services  You'll get a daily list  Daily  But I was a bit  Apprehensive to tell you  The truth  When you did the first hour  Of the show  Right  Without the hot topics list  You know what  We didn't hit one hot topic  On the list  Yeah I know that  But I want the listeners  To call right now  And I don't want to go  For the goof here  I want to show you  How fucking lame radio is  How lame consultants are  How lame talent coaches are  They're actually  You're paying for this guy's service  And he's going to give you  A list of hot topics  Yeah  You call right now  And try to figure out  What one of the hot topics 
[01:29:30]  Would be  On this list  Oh  This is a good bit Opie  This is good  Because it gets the callers involved  Showing that the average listener  No offense  Could figure out  What's on the hot topic list  Think  Think about what's going on  In the world right now  Right  Think  Just think  It gets the callers thinking  And it gets them  Feeling like they're part of our show  And there's no way  They fucking  Got this list in their hands  But then again  The phones are just  Kind of being answered  Very slowly  A little sluggish 
[01:30:00]  A little sluggish today  The phones need a little activia  A little sluggish  E-Rock  You got something on the talent coach  Or are you just coming into what  What are you doing  Take a walk  What are you doing  Just doing laughs  The talent coach would not be happy  No  With E-Rock just walking in the middle  Of a morning show  No  We'd sit down E-Rock  And say  What do you do here  You're looking for a sound clip  Yeah  I can't wait to see what sound clip  You want me to play desperately  That you had to interrupt our 
[01:30:30]  Our magic that is happening here  The chemistry  Again  I feel like we're losing focus  On the task at hand  Anthony  It might be easy  Just to do it on the instant feedback  Because that's coming in pretty fast  Okay  Chester's liver writes  Is the state of the union on there  Hit the bell  Yes it is  State of the union address  Is on the hot topic list  That you would have to pay for  If you hired the Reynolds group  To be a talent coach  For your morning show  And that is something  That you guys brought up  So good job  Good job

[01:33:30]  Of course it is  What the fuck is this  This guy's a shyster  This is a day for dude  This is complete and utter bullshit  I don't think this is  You can't figure this out  This is just dumb luck  I don't think this is how he intended  The list to be used  Really  I think this is something  That's supposed to be spread out  Throughout the week  We've already hit several topics  Is this us hitting the topics  Yes  I'm hitting a bell  I know that much  And you know what  Just to run through it  People are guessing  Jersey Shore  Yes that's on the hot topic list 
[01:34:00]  SAG Awards is on the hot topic list  Andy Dick is on the hot topic list  Healthcare is on the hot topic list  Scott Brown is on the hot topic list  Groundhog Day is on the hot topic list  Sundance Film Festival is on the hot topic list  Prince is on the hot topic list  Wycliffe Jean is on the hot topic list  Michael Vick  H1N1  Teddy Pendergrass  And finally  The Winter Olympics  Yes  But see  You  The morning show host is stupid  And you need  The Reynolds group  To tell you what the hot topics are 
[01:34:30]  Alright let's go  Are you fucking kidding me  Let's go to some music  So  So  What  Can we hit some music or something  So we can  Turn the page  Move along to the next thing  Cause  We should play some songs  Once again  Nick Cannon  He's now doing mornings  In our old seats  And they realized early on  That the guy  Just doesn't know how to do radio  So they hired a talent coach  It's the Reynolds group  By the way  The Reynolds group  They know how to spend their money  I got a little more inside info 
[01:35:00]  On the Reynolds group  They actually approached  Z100  Which is 92.3 now's  Main competition here in New York City  And Z100  They said  Z  We want to coach your talent  Z  Elvis Duran  Who really hasn't been in the game  Yeah  Elvis Duran  Yeah  He's been doing it for a very long time  So they  Punch it up  This talent group  This Reynolds guy  Goes  Z  You need my help  That's right  You need my help Z  And know what Z100 said  Go fuck yourself  You fucking hack  I was never successful  Doing mornings yourself 
[01:35:30]  That's the right answer  Z100  So you know what the Reynolds group said  And this is very inside info  What  They basically said  You know what fucking Z  We're taking you down  We're taking you down  Yes  We are going to work with Nick Cannon  And we're taking you down  See you later phone scams  We got Mariah Carey prank calls  That's right  E-Rock's weight by the way  Was on the hot topic list  You are right  Oh gosh  And for the record  E-Rock  For the record  E-Rock came in  And distracted everybody  And I still don't know why 
[01:36:00]  Why did he  He came in  I still don't know why  He shuffled through  Some of your templates  For your shortcut  And he just put  Template number six  In front of me  And then walked out  And let the record show  There's probably  Fifty buttons  I could push  On this one alone  Buttons per template  Right  And then he just walked out  So thank you E-Rock  It's important when  Structuring a morning show  That we don't have  Distractions like that  Right  I bet he's rolling his eyes  Right now in disgust  Of course he is  He rolls his eyes at me  So  Got his hands up in the air  And his shoulders shrugged  Yeah  Nothing better than 
[01:36:30]  When we beat the shit out of someone  They just throw their arms up in the air  And walk down the wall  Resign to defeat  Right  Alright so now  With this talent group  This Reynolds group  Yeah  Not only do they give you  Hot topics of the day  Or the week or whatever  They give you show ideas  You got some bits  That you can do  Right  With American Idol  I don't even really get this  With American Idol  America's comfort food  For television  Back on the air  It's time to ramp up 
[01:37:00]  Ideas around it  This is one place  Where I've noticed  You guys have suffered  A little bit  We have not had a lot  Of American Idol  Related bits  True  True  I think that maybe  We could get some more  Listeners involved  If we did that  American Idol bits  Yeah because that's  A very hot topic  Yeah exactly  It was on the list  So this clown  And I've been in radio  A long time  Haven't even heard his name before  He's going to tell  Morning shows  Look you need  You need an idea  That revolves around  American Idol  He goes 
[01:37:30]  A zillion parodies  Have been done  But the one we like  The most is  Do we have a drum roll  Oh no no no  Stop this  This is not real  A zillion American Idol  Parodies have been done  By other shows  But the one we like  The most is  Jailhouse Idol  What do you do  For a living  Jailhouse Idol 
[01:38:00]  All right  Let's have an open mind  Sorry  Let's have an open mind  What do prisoners  Have lots of  The answer  The answer anyone  Because Reynolds  Has to tell you everything  Time  You are correct Anthony  Hit the bell  It's got a big  Exclamation point  Behind time  Time  That's what prisoners  Have a lot of time  So  And your local prison  Might just let them  Make collect calls  From the phones  Huh  Huh  Oh  If they're well behaved  Let prisoners 
[01:38:30]  In local jails  Call the request line  Collect while their  Morning show is on  And have  Hey can you help me out  With this reading  Yeah  Because this punctuation  Is so fucked up  I know  He's all fucked up  It's a terrible  Prisoners in local jails  Call  The request line  Collect  While the morning show  Is on  And have them  Over the run  Of the TV show  Sing for you  Oh oh oh okay  As individuals  Or groups 
[01:39:00]  Whenever they call  You don't actually  Have to have a competition  Amongst them  Just prisoners singing  Is enough  To justify doing this  So you'd have  Throughout the entire  Season of American Idol  Prisoners in jail  Are calling  And singing songs  On the phone  Alright we're a pretty  Fucking  Oh well maybe they don't  Have satellite radio  Prison  Yeah  Our prison fucking  Listenership went way down  Yeah it dipped way down  When they  Um  Yeah  So  Jailhouse Idol  Basically they would 
[01:39:30]  Solicit local jails  To have  Prisoners call  And sing  Yeah you've heard  Of American Idol  This is Jailhouse Idol  You'll also have  Stories to tell  From those  Incarcerated  Thus increasing  The intrigue factor  Of the bit  This is key  What is  Basically he's trying  To tell you  Because you don't know  How to do this yourself  Oh my god  Other morning shows  Out there  If someone calls  From jail  Yeah yeah  You ask him a few questions  You probably got a story there  Why are you in jail 
[01:40:00]  He's in jail  You have a story  Why are you in jail  What happens in jail  But you know  You have a jail story  So um  But that's what we would call  The intrigue factor  Oh intrigue factor  And Dave in Chicago  I just don't have time  To go to the phones right now  He goes  Reynolds just reads  Google Trends  Yeah  That's where he gets  His hot topics from  You're so right  You don't actually have  A competition  Oh okay  You don't actually have  To have a competition  Among them  Yeah  Just prisoners singing  Is enough to justify  Doing this  That's what he's saying  You don't have to go crazy 
[01:40:30]  Just get some prisoners  To sing  And people will be like  Whoa this morning show  Has people who are  Incarcerated  Singing songs  Holy mother of fuck  This guy  Eric in Virginia Tech  Can't get to your phone call  But yes  Orange marmalade  Is on the hot topic list  Are you sure  No it definitely is there Sam  Alright  I wouldn't have put it  So you're going to get stories  And you're going to get  Prisoners singing  And wow  That's going to get  The ratings up right  Because American Idol  Is going on  So people have that  In the front of their minds  Okay  Right 
[01:41:00]  Right  Anthony  Valentine's Day  Is right around the corner  Well we know that  We haven't been doing  A lot of Valentine's Day  Bits on this show  And if you hire  Hire the talent coach  The Reynolds group  Who's helping Nick Cannon  Because Nick Cannon  Can't do radio  On his own  Correct  If you hire this  Fucking talent group  They're going to give you  A Valentine's Day bit  Anthony  They're going to give you  A Valentine's Day bit  I think we  I think we  Gave them the idea  For this bit  Is it one of ours  I'm sure it is  Well  With Valentine's Day 
[01:41:30]  About one month away  How about doing  Ghosts of Valentine's Day past  Ghosts of Valentine's Day past  Yes  Set up a special phone line  For guys who've wronged  A woman in the past  And need to apologize  Really  Wait you did that  I didn't do it yet  But you're going to do it right  Well maybe  Air the compelling audio  You get off the phone line  And facilitate  A few public apologies  On the show  From guys to their  Former girlfriends  The week of the holiday  Then award each of them 
[01:42:00]  Valentine's Day dinners  With their current partners  That way everybody  Ends on a happy note  Right right  It's not like  You're breaking up  A relationship  You've got to keep  Everything safe  And happy  The whole idea  Is that you get  A sense of closure  From the two  That broke up  And then you'd realize  What do you do for a living  Character  I was trying to  Maybe be a talent coach  You know what  That ain't working  This fuck's a dick  You think so  Yeah  I mean morning show  This is like  Just basic morning show shit 
[01:42:30]  Yeah  Said that the  The number one market  In radio  Had to hire a talent coach  For their morning guy  Well this is the second show  In New York  To hire this talent coach  Alright and finally  Because we can't spend  All day with this Sam  Finally  I mean it's good tips  Oh are they  I think so  Oh you know what  We're going to go with  More hot topics Sam  Tony in Iowa  Tony  Yeah one that was left off  Was Jennifer Anderson  Has got a smelly pussy  Google it  That is on the  Hot topics list  Are you sure  That's on the list  They gave you 
[01:43:00]  Google it  Google it  She's got the  Smelliest pussy in Hollywood  I'm telling you  Google it  Everyone knows it  My sources are telling me  Google it  Smelliest pussy  Google it  Google it  We were talking about  Jennifer Anderson  Smelly pussy again  Before the show  Yes  We're all compelled with it  And who came up with the fact  That Brad Pitt is a bohemian  And we know what  That's all about  Yeah I do remember  Reading that  Back in the day  That some people said  That Brad Pitt did not  Take regular showers  Yeah not the 
[01:43:30]  And the reason was  Because  Jennifer Anderson's pussy  This is me just  Just kind of going with it  You really have something  Against her pussy  I don't really know for sure  Okay  But I'm guessing  That Brad Pitt  Stopped showering  To kind of hide the fact  That Jennifer Anderson  Has a really smelly pussy  Like his own reek  Will kind of cancel it out  Dude  Can you smell your own farts  Um yeah  Can you smell your own stench  No  Your own body odor  Doesn't really bother you 
[01:44:00]  You know it would be awful  For somebody else  It's there  Right  But you can handle  Your own smell  So if you have a woman  That has a really smelly pussy  Right  You're not going to shower  So you can smell your own shit  Before you smell hers  My only problem  With this being a hot topic  Is I feel like  It takes some of the women  They might not get on board  With this  Some of the female listeners  Might be more offended by it  And we wouldn't get to have  Oh  We're looking for max appeal 
[01:44:30]  Look even if there's a few people  That think that's kind of a good idea  The fact remains that  It's a basic bit that  If you hire a creative radio show  They could come up with this shit  On their own  Yeah  They really can  You know the  The morning zoo type radio  Is not my cup of tea  But those guys  Kind of know what they're doing  They were hired to do that type of radio  I just  I'm sorry  The last page  You read it  No I just turned the page  Is it the last page  I think so  I just turned the page  It's called the big get Anthony  We got the big get  Alright yeah yeah yeah  We're going to do that in a second 
[01:45:00]  But first  Jack in Massachusetts  Jack  And by the way  Our listeners could come up with bits  That are way better  Than this stupid talent coach  On any given day  Go ahead Jack  Yeah so you can combine  The American Idol bit  With the  Valentine's bit  And have Sex Offender Idol  Sex Offender Idol  Okay  Sex Offender Idol  Is beautiful Sam  That seems like  It could offend people  Who might have been victims  Of such crimes  No  That guy's a genius  Sex Offender Idol  Would be  Brilliant  You missed your calling sir  I don't know if I can get behind that 
[01:45:30]  And I want them to sing  Nothing but boy band songs  Yeah  Could you see guys in prison  On the phone  Singing American Idol songs  Like  You would get shanked  You think so  The second you hung that phone up  Or raped  And then shanked  We don't want to talk about that  Let's get to the final page  Terrible  The Reynolds group  You know the morning mashup  Does it without a talent coach  Oh do they  They do  Really  That's right  And they have bits like  Whose mama knows  What's whose mama knows 
[01:46:00]  Whose mama knows  Well they play  The song for it  Is a parody  Of the Mark Anthony song  I need to know  Except it's  Whose mama knows  And they ask a question  And then the listener  Has to guess  Which morning mashup  Show host's mom  Knows the answer  And then they'll play a clip  Yeah  Wait  What  You understand  Yeah you know  Kevin from Connecticut  Makes a great point  You guys turned a phone  Catastrophe  Into 45 minutes 
[01:46:30]  Of mediocre radio  This morning  While we're trying  To get that  That's what we do  Sam  Exactly what we do  Linger two hours ago  Alright here's the final  What is this  Is this kind of like  An online resume  Of what this guy  Could do for you  Yeah it's basically  These are some samples  Of what he does  As a talent coach  If this is what  I'm giving you for free  Imagine what you'll get  If you pay my  Exorbitant fees  Is there any way  Exorbitant fees  Is there any way  Our listeners  Could maybe go to the website  And leave comments 
[01:47:00]  I don't know  There is on the website  If you google  Reynolds group radio  Yeah  I don't think  There's a comment box  Per se  But there is an email  In case people  Are interested  Hey Sean from North Carolina  Makes a very good point  Sean  Make your point  To America  Yes  Hey if this guy  If he's somehow successful  In fixing Nick Cannon's show  He should change his name  To the n-word whisperer  Okay  Oh jeez  That's the type of thing 
[01:47:30]  We need to get a call screener  On to take care of  It's kind of funny though  We need a call screener  Not allowing those calls  He's a talent coach  You know  Kind of like the dog whisperer  No I know  And he's working with a black guy  So come on Sam  That's kind of funny  The n-word whisperer  Not everything has to be  Turned into a racist thing  That's just funny  I mean it should  But it will offend  Is the problem  Alright finally  So the Reynolds group  The talent coach  Yeah helping out Nick Cannon  Here in New York  Because they realize  Nick just doesn't know  How to do radio  That's true  He's a nice guy  A lot of energy  So they thought  People will listen to that shit 
[01:48:00]  He can do radio  Alright yeah  Mariah Carey  The whole thing there  And you enjoyed  Frank Hall  You enjoyed the  You really enjoyed  The final  I turned  The page here  Why don't you take over here  This is fantastic  What an idea he has here  Do anything with cute sounding kids  And you have yourself  A feature  There you go  A featured bit  A featured bit  Which is gold  To the radio show  It is a benchmark  It's recurring

We're going to get it  I vouch for this  I get fucked  I don't need that  Yeah  They're big  Production  Oh my god  I went to the range yesterday  Because you know  I like brushing up on my skills  Sure  Fire some weaponry  Fire some weaponry  Or weaponry  I always put a T in that word too  I don't know how appropriate  Some of my targets are  Like I know  Now 
[03:06:00]  What do you have a lawn jockey?  Well  What do you have?  I have numerous targets  My favorites are these zombie targets  There's like  Life size zombies  Really?  Yeah it's cool as shit  And then they got a little brain  In the corner  So you got to pump them  Into the brains and shit  Wait where did you get  The zombie target?  At zombie target dot com  Oh so you get a mail to you  Of course  Yeah yeah  I didn't know that  You go to zombie target  But you can pick them up  Elsewhere and stuff  And get them at other places too  But um  The uh  I have a few 
[03:06:30]  Of  Different ethnic backgrounds  One of which is  Terrorists  So you got guys  At AK-47s and turbans  Right  I have Osama bin Laden  Right  But then I got like  Black guys  Holding shotguns  Gangsters and shit  And I feel like  I always leave those at home  I go like  Maybe I shouldn't take this one  But meanwhile  It's like  How come you could shoot  At the white guy target?  They got like  We always talk about  The target of the white guy  Going like  He's got the cigar out of his mouth 
[03:07:00]  Like they used it  Back in the old FBI  Fucking 1950s training films  Sean Dillinger  Yeah  But I  We never  I can't bring the black guy target  To the range  Because I think  It's going to offend somebody  And for me to do that  You're not even worried  It's going to offend somebody  You're worried that  There might be a gangster  At the range  A black guy at the range  And now you're going to  Have to fight him  Well  A fight at the range  Probably wouldn't last very long  Yeah  Exactly  Especially with this  Fucking little thing  This guy  The other guy probably  Has like a six shooter  This fucking dummy 
[03:07:30]  Is going to pull out a 50 gal  Yeah  I had my Uzi  With 30 round clips  Jesus Christ  Just nine millimeter  It's hysterical  But yeah  That's the old 1950s  You know what  That looks like  What Clint Eastwood would shoot  Yeah  In Dirty Harry  Dirty Harry targets  We didn't talk about that guy  I think this week  Matter of fact  Yeah  The guy that models  For that target  Is dead  He passed away  I guess he was more famous  Than we thought  I guess so  Was he a cop or some shit  I guess 
[03:08:00]  It was the model  For the shooting target  He modeled  The bad guy target  It's your generic  White 50s  Bad guy looking  But it's lasted  Throughout the years  But these are like  Photographs  They're poster sized  Photographs  That you made  In your basement  No I didn't  Of  Like black gang bangers  With fucking  AKs  And fucking pistols  Holding them sideways  And shit  But it's like  Yeah  If a black guy's  In the shooting range  With me  It'll be like  Oh look  I just fucking 
[03:08:30]  Rolled out a black guy  To shoot at  Down range  You accidentally  Shoot him  But  Oh I thought  You were the target  No  You try to pin him  To the fucking target  And shoot him back  To the end of the range  Hey motherfucker  What are you doing  No it's  Like the zombies are fun  That's a fun target  And like the gang banger  Would be kind of  You know cool  Because  It's gang banger  You know  Your real fears  Yo motherfucker  Yeah and then  Bam bam bam  That is his real fear  Not the terrorists  Or any of the other people  No my real 
[03:09:00]  I don't have a fear  First of all  What I  Exercise my second  Amendment right  To protect myself  From  Are  Bad people  Of all nationalities  I'm talking about  Home invaders  Things like that  People get their doors  Kicked in all the time  Or  When you fantasize  About it though  Yeah  You know you fantasize  About it  Because you have to  Rehearse it in your head  Yeah  And you fantasize  About it happening  Yeah  What color are they  I will not tell you  What color they are  All I will say is  When I run a scenario 
[03:09:30]  Through my head  Scenario  Where I am  What scenario  There is a home  Or scenario  Through my head  Where I am being  Home invaded  Yeah  I use  The bad guys  Which  Have  Committed  The most home invasions  That I have seen  In a certain demographic  In my area  Can he talk around  Something or what  Wow  That is what I do  I want to hire you  To be my lawyer  So check the FBI stats  Check the crime stats

[03:10:30]  That's all  Just do it  Do it quietly  I gotta actually  Put the earphones on  So I don't hurt my ears  The eye protection  And a gag  Yeah  You god damn  I sound like  Kenny from South Park  You gotta film that shit  I don't know  Like  And you know me  The last thing  I'm afraid of  Is somebody saying  You're a racist  It's like  That doesn't bother me  It just  Is it inappropriate 
[03:11:00]  I don't know  I don't know  If hanging  A black gangster  Target up  Oh believe me  They make targets  Of fucking  They'll make targets  Of anything  Some are really inappropriate  This might shock you  But I say it's not  You say it's not  No  Okay  Alright  It's a bad guy right  You wanna shoot bad guys  Whether they're terrorists  It's not a woman  Pushing a stroller  Did you buy them  Did you buy these targets  I buy them  I get them sent to me  What website  Did you get them  What area nation website  Did you get them  You don't wanna know 
[03:11:30]  No I didn't get them  You don't wanna know  Endmania.com  You had to cut the nooses  Off them  No I didn't get them  No those were given  To me as gifts  Really  Did they salute you  When they gave them  Stuff like that  No  Anthony's been invited  Commandant  Anthony's been invited  He's been invited  To go big game hunting  I don't like hunting  Where  I'm not  I'm not a hunter  I'm a target  I like target shooting  I'm not a hunter 
[03:12:00]  I don't like killing things  You don't like hunting  Things down  I like target shooting  You know what  I see you  Like in the future  I see you  Being those guys  Like where they get  Like a homeless guy  Like iced tea  And you bring them  To an island  And you and a bunch  Of your good old boys  Hunt them down  And use your new weapons  I don't know  You befriend them  Like come on man  We'll help you out  And you give them  A little money  Give them dinner  And he's like  Oh yeah thanks  You're redoing my joke  That was my big game  Hunting joke  I wasn't  I wasn't redoing 
[03:12:30]  It's called punching it up  In the business  I'm punching it up  Are there any  A little punch up  I'm adding more details to it  I was just trying to  Keep it vague for everybody  And you went right  To the details  Situational targets  Funny by the way  What's a situational target  Those are like  Certain situations  See there's a hostage  With a guy  Oh I like situational targets  There's a zombie  I have the zombie targets  There's that one  Are there any  Are there only white people  On these targets  Oh my god  That's interesting  No it's weird  They got a target 
[03:13:00]  Where me and Anthony  Are being held hostage  By a radio company  Yeah look at that  I want to get that one  I want to get the hostage one  You know what you do  You shoot the hostage  You know what you should do  You should get  You should have them made  All your bosses here  At Sirius  You should have those made up  I don't think that would be  A nice thing  We love our bosses Bobby  I think it would make  For a hostile work environment  That's right  Which is what I'm not into  That at all  No we're not into that  Pleasantries  I didn't mean that  Pleasantries  I said  You really don't know  When you guys are going  To go fucking left  Oh what is that 
[03:13:30]  Oh shit yo  Patrice O'Neill  Federal air marshal target  What is that guy  He's some black guy  Anthony  You got the phone  Hold on  You got the phone  He's a gay gangster painter  You got the phone  Slit here  Dave in Maryland  Dave  Hey Ant  I know exactly  What you mean  About those targets  I took my 14 year old kid  Target student  Last year for the first time  And we bought the target  With the four corner  Targets on them  So you have four places  To shoot at  Right  The white guy target 
[03:14:00]  And then he got an  Assault with Bin Laden  And I wasn't even  Thinking about it  And we went in there  And we shot the white guy  In the four corners  And then two Muslims  Came in next to us  And they had like a  Big gun  It was just  Pow pow  It had me jumping  And we were on our last target  And I didn't even think about it  I'm loading the gun up  And my son throws that target up  And starts to send it out  And I reach over  And smack his damn hand  And yank it back in  And I was like  No, no, no  But see that  That I wouldn't even  Think twice about  Because I did  Yesterday I rolled out  An Osama Bin Laden target 
[03:14:30]  It was Bin Laden  Holding an AK-47  And you know  I roll it out there  Who's going to argue that one  Yeah that's the exact target  I had yesterday  Oh no kidding  But yeah  Two Muslims next to you though  And they had guns  I just said  Fuck them  You know something  See now I say fuck them  Because that's Osama Bin Laden  He's a bad guy  Everyone knows it  But like the black gangsta target  I would feel weird  If a black guy walked in  It's like  Oh he's shooting at  A black guy target  With that said  Let's go to Tim on Long Island  Tim  It'd feel weird  But there'd be a little tingling inside  No  The thing is 
[03:15:00]  Chances are  The black guy's going to roll out  A white guy target  Oh yeah  And you could argue with him  About the white guy target  And you could say  Listen  You got a white guy target  I'm protecting myself from you  That's why I have a black guy  Yeah but then he might say  Let's trade  And then all my fun stuff  Why don't you just get  A light skinned black guy  Nobody likes them  No  Nobody likes them  No  It has nothing to do  It's just  It's a target  It has nothing to do  With my preference of targets  Like to tell you the truth  I prefer the zombie targets 
[03:15:30]  It's fun  Zombie invasion  Oh my god  Shoot him in the head  Bobby how black is too black  How black is too black  In your little world  How black is too black  Because it always looks like  You just ate powdered sugar  Around your mouth  You're black  Can you have black zombie  You're just black  That's my favorite type of black girl  Is the really African black  Yeah  Yeah the tall  Thin  Like they could run for like  70 days straight  And not stop  Tootsies  Yeah tootsies  Yeah  We know about the Tootsies  Oh I love them  The Who Toos
