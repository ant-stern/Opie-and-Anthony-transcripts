<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a lengthy and highly offensive discussion of Tiger Woods's golfing slump, attributing it to his personal life and infidelities.  Callers Travis and Craig contribute to this segment, which also includes crude commentary on other golfers and a viral video of an elderly woman and a dog.  Frank calls in with a brief, contrasting reflection on fatherhood.  The hosts also mention listener Janine and her "Princess Poppycunt" picture.  The segment concludes with opinions on music (disdain for Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber) and movies, specifically praising *Step Up 3D*.

Next, the show tackles the overuse of 3D in movies, mocking examples like *Step Up 3D* and *Jaws 2*, and discussing upcoming releases such as *Yogi Bear* and *Piranha 3D*.  A caller shares a negative *Piranha 3D* screening experience.  A rumor about Bubba the Love Sponge pressuring Cowhead is discussed, with E-Rock implicated in bringing the rumor to the hosts' attention. This segment concludes with Oscar, the show's intern, filling in for Jim Norton.  Oscar’s awkward attempts at contributing are a recurring theme, punctuated by rambling anecdotes about work, a failed attempt to connect with a female coworker named Kristen, and observations about current events.  Mars also interacts with Oscar during this segment.

Comedian Bob Kelly joins the show, recounting a story about breaking a TV.  He discusses his experience filming a crying scene for *Louie*, involving the use of hot sauce (though an on-air attempt fails).  The conversation shifts to Kelly's roles in *Louie* and *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, including an improvised line he was asked not to repeat.  An extended, absurd exchange ensues about Oscar’s inability to cry on cue, involving attempts with Tabasco sauce and wasabi.  The conversation veers into numerous tangents, including jokes about Oscar's perceived lack of talent, a fake Rolex, Kelly's baldness, childhood memories, racist remarks, social media, and home security cameras.  The hosts struggle to create effective radio teases.  Kelly’s upcoming stand-up appearances and Anthony's home security system are also discussed. The segment ends with discussions about fire and dangerous childhood activities.

The show then features a sexually explicit account by one of the hosts about a date with a Black woman, sparking discussion on racial stereotypes, terminology used to refer to Black people, tipping practices, and strippers.  The host details past sexual encounters, including graphic descriptions of various sexual acts.  Oscar again appears, unsuccessfully attempting to cry on cue with wasabi.  Bob Kelly is still present, discussing weight loss and smoking. Opie recounts a physical altercation on a golf course. Oscar shares awkward pickup lines and a bizarre story involving a cow costume.  A police car chase video is also shown and discussed.

The final segment is a chaotic and sexually charged conversation. Oscar recounts a night of heavy drinking and waking up next to a man after a night of Kung Fu movies, leading to discussions about cocaine and Colombia.  The hosts and Oscar make crude jokes about Colombian drug cartels, gay bars, and Oscar's sexual encounters. Ira, described as embodying negative stereotypes, is introduced, boasting about his sexual exploits.  The conversation becomes increasingly graphic and crude, involving the hosts, Oscar, Ira, and Bobo.  Bobo is eventually expelled from the studio.  The show concludes with a live advertisement for Carbonite.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever. 
[00:00:30]  Shut up.  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We got it.  We got it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Oh, yeah.  Where is our Friday guy? 
[00:01:00]  I used to get air checks of the Friday guy.  A complete homeless lunatic that did radio in, I don't know, somewhere.  San Jose, Sacramento, San Francisco area.  Somewhere out there.  He was the Friday guy.  We used to play on the N.E.W. show all the time.  You know.  It's Friday.  Friday.  I have it somewhere.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, Op. 
[00:01:30]  What's slackening?  What's slackening?  Well, I thought it's Friday.  Oh, TGIF.  I always play.  Well, I'm finally better now that it's Friday.  I would officially say I'm healthy again.  You're cured.  Just in time for the weekend, which is nice.  Yeah, that's good.  Which is nice.  Because usually you get sick and it hits you on a Friday.  Hits you on a Friday.  It fucks up the weekend. 
[00:02:00]  And then you're all better in time to go back to work.  Yeah, that always blows.  So I think this time it's working out in my favor.  But yesterday just laid around the house all day.  Because you've got to make sure you do the right thing.  Get some rest and fucking don't do the relapse thing.  Yeah, you don't want to relapse.  I hate the relapse.  That's awful.  I was watching, actually, Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods might be done as a professional golfer.  Really?  A lot of people saying that.  He is stinking up the joint. 
[00:02:30]  Too much shit happened.  He lost too many people that were, like, I guess, key to his success.  And now he's just out there, him and his fucking big dick,  just thinking about fucking more than golfing.  And now, I mean, now he can't keep calm.  Yeah.  You would think before he would have a tough time keeping calm,  banging all those broads, you know, wondering if his wife's going to find out.  You can't go cold turkey off of broads.  Well, he's not going cold turkey, do you?  Do you think so?  He can't be. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, wait, you know what?  The new girls would be coming out of the woodwork.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they're all whores in the end.  They're all whores.  They're all whores.  You're a whore.  The whole lot of you, you're all whores.  I hear that.  Yeah, so he can't get a new girl.  Stupid me.  I'm thinking he's getting new pussy all over the place.  Nah, he's got to be a good boy.  So he's probably getting nothing.  And it's fucking him up.  You think Tiger Woods wants to sit there and think,  I'm Tiger Woods, as he's jacking his own dick,  knowing that he could get fucking the Perkins waitress? 
[00:03:30]  Probably can't even go on his computer because they're watching that, too.  Ah, they're watching everything.  So he's got to go old school, National Geographic or something?  Just dry jerk to some fucking paper porn.  To a bra ad in the back of a fucking Us Weekly or something?  Just terrible.  To a Denny's menu.  Yeah, exactly.  With the fucking waitress bringing over a Grand Slam.  Whatever happened to her?  I don't know.  The Perkins waitress?  You want to talk about 15 minutes of fame, man.  She had her 15 minutes and went right back to getting the fucking omelets together. 
[00:04:00]  Was she the only one that decided she wasn't going to capitalize on the situation?  I don't know.  I think she tried a little bit.  There she is.  Thank you.  I think she tried a little.  What a mess.  You know, she's ready and willing for Tiger.  Totally.  But Tiger Woods, he's playing in a tournament.  He's won seven times out of the last nine years, something like that.  I see Travis reaching for a mic, and I don't mind that, Travis,  because you helped me out with the car shit.  Seven of his 71 wins are in this course. 
[00:04:30]  This is his best course.  Wow.  And he's ten strokes off the lead after the first round.  And, I mean, did you watch, Travis?  I watched a little of it.  I forgot it was on.  It's the first round.  You never think golf's on on Thursdays.  Yeah, I've never seen...  I've been a Tiger Woods fan for a really long time.  Sure.  I've never seen him play a worse round of golf.  He had his evil goatee.  Yeah.  I told you he would go evil goatee.  He's finally doing evil goatee.  Evil goatee.  Well, we said it on the show that he should just fucking grow his hair, get it all nappy. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Yes, that's a word they use when it gets a little out of control.  Of course.  Look at our own Sam Roberts has nappy hair.  Would you acknowledge that nappy hair?  Nappy.  Yeah, I think nappy.  Nappy is an okay word in this context.  So why did I must get fired for saying nappy-headed hoes?  I think it was the hoes part.  Yeah, to combine nappy and hoe is a little...  No, when you say whore, it's different than hoe.  But you guys started by saying whores.  What?  Well, they all...  People use you out of context.  Yeah, but they'd have to turn it around.  And edit. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, and edit.  And it would sound all bad.  That's right.  We stand by the fact that I shouldn't have been fired.  No, of course.  That's right.  Now, as I'm looking at Tiger Woods, he has the evil goatee.  Yes.  And what's he wearing on his head?  Nothing?  Is he just wearing his receding hairline?  Is that what he's...  Yeah.  Oh, you suck.  Oh, look at him.  There he is.  Yeah, evil goatee.  Yeah, he...  What is he thinking?  Like, like...  I think he's thinking, I need to get some pussy. 
[00:06:00]  Ah, that poor bastard can't touch anything.  I think he was driving his ball into the woods, maybe hoping there's just some whore in the woods.  Or you can catch a quick blowjob while he's looking for his ball.  Oh, got to go in the woods again.  I'll be right back.  I got to go find my...  That'd be great.  Wait, we can't really see Tiger right now.  Right.  He's in the woods, but obviously looking for his ball.  He doesn't want to have to take a drop here.  Wait a minute.  Is he taking a leak? 
[00:06:30]  Wait, he's not taking a leak.  Oh, there's somebody kneeling in front of him, perhaps helping him out.  Right.  But...  And then he shoots a great fucking round.  But the course is easy.  The first two holes on this course, real easy holes.  He bogeys both of them.  I think he's just spraying his drives into the woods.  He hits five fairways.  Hit five out of, what would it be, 14 fairways, technically?  Because then he got the part threes.  32 putts.  I could probably do that. 
[00:07:00]  32 putts is brutal in the PGA.  Man.  Brutal.  So...  Yeah, this is something he's going to have to work through.  10 strokes off the lead in a tournament that he pretty much won with a hand behind his  back.  So who's like the guy now?  Well, Phil Mickelson.  If Phil Mickelson wins the tournament...  If he's the guy, like, wow, he's the fucking guy.  There's a lot of young guys coming up that are exciting to watch.  You like that Ricky Fowler, Travis?  Yeah, he's good.  I like him. 
[00:07:30]  I like a lot of the young guys.  Oh, do you?  Well...  Game.  I'm sure everyone will know I was talking about golf when that's...  Oh, right?  Yeah, wow.  I'm still a Phil Mickelson guy.  Look at Travis's boyfriend.  You're a Phil Mickelson guy.  There he is.  Wow, look at this Justin Bieber of the golf course.  Wow, Travis.  Good taste in boys. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, I mean, there's a whole bunch of young guys coming up, so...  I like Rory McElroy.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a pretty solid player.  Yeah.  But the paper's bitching today because Tiger's out of this tournament.  Done.  Or at least first round wasn't looking good.  There was no reason to follow him yesterday.  And you would think he was leading the tournament because they didn't show anyone except Tiger Woods.  Every shot of Tiger you saw on TV yesterday.  Yeah.  Every shot. 
[00:08:30]  Is this one of the new guys?  That's Rory.  Travis, you're so gay.  I don't like these people based on their looks.  Look at this fucking...  Travis thinks they're cute.  The kid's like 21.  He's great.  Little twink.  Yeah, they're all just young fucking...  Up-and-comers.  Up-and-comers.  Yeah.  And they're good?  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  They're...  You know, no one's really leading...  You know, leading the pack.  No one's got that Tiger Heat that he had a few years ago. 
[00:09:00]  I don't know if anyone's going to have the Tiger Heat.  Yeah, that's big.  He's like the...  Tiger's run was ridiculous.  The Michael Jordan kind of heat.  I think you'll have like a Michael Jordan thing happen with Tiger Woods.  He'll come back next year and he'll have a nice fucking year.  Have his head screwed on straight.  But nothing like he's had in the past.  And then I think he starts fading...  I really think he starts fading away, man.  Wow.  I think he's just fucking...  He's had it.  That'd be...  What an unexpected kind of sad thing to have a guy like that just go out like that.  Because he's still relatively young. 
[00:09:30]  Especially for golf.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But something is fucked up with this guy.  His whole head is fucked.  I predict he fires his caddy in the offseason.  Really?  Yeah.  Which would be pretty crazy, too.  Because he's been with Steve Williams for a long time.  But...  Yeah.  The whole thing with his...  First his dad.  And then the whore thing.  And his wife.  And then, what?  His coach?  Yeah, he fired his coach.  Fired his coach.  But he's always like kind of changing that around.  And firing him. 
[00:10:00]  Rehiring him.  But I mean, all at once.  It's just kind of a...  Yeah.  Fucked up thing.  This guy's got everybody that was around him as his support staff is just dwindling away.  And he's out there hacking into the woods.  Yeah.  Ten strokes off the lead.  He's walking off the course yesterday.  And one of the fans said,  You're washed up, Tiger.  Give it up.  Oh, shit.  He had to deal with that yesterday.  Fuck, it's golf.  You don't yell that shit.  He had to deal with that.  But he didn't even acknowledge the guy said it.  But it's all over the papers today.  A heckler.  That a heckler got in.  Should have fucking hit him with a nine iron across the head. 
[00:10:30]  Fuck.  That's rough.  So you asked.  That's what I was doing yesterday.  Watching Tiger just stick up the joint.  And like I said, they showed every fucking shot of Tiger's.  Even though...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Even though there were guys playing the course properly and doing really well, you wouldn't know it because you didn't see any of their shots.  Because they have to continue to follow Tiger around even though he's not winning tournaments this year.  I think people just want to see him still.  You know, it's like the people that watch golf, I guess, kind of want to...  I get it to a point. 
[00:11:00]  But I'm telling you, every shot hit.  Every fucking shot.  Blowing off other guys that were doing well.  Like the cute guys that Travis likes?  Travis, name another...  Name another one of your sweeties.  Name another golfer you like.  I'm good, thanks.  I like Steve Stricker.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  But he's an older guy.  Oh.  More mature.  Yeah, yeah.  Going into the father figure type of situation.  Now, Steve Stricker, he's a solid golfer. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Friends with Tiger, too, I believe.  Oh, there you go.  He's still ranked number one.  Who?  Tiger.  No, I know that.  Yeah.  But if Phil Mickelson wins this weekend, I believe...  I think Phil has to win, like, one tournament.  Well, Phil's a choke meister, though, right?  Not as...  Not like he used to be.  Not as much in the last few years.  But I would still put him in that choke category.  The choke category.  The best choke ever was...  I forgot all the circumstances, but he had a real shot.  Was it the U.S. Open when he put his stupid drive in the trash bag? 
[00:12:00]  You're talking like three years ago?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he, like...  I think he just needed to par or birdie a hole at the 18th, and he would win.  And he ended up, like, double bogeying or something?  Because he hit his drive in a trash bag, and then I think he hit it on the roof.  I was like, what are you doing?  All you need is a fucking parm.  Will you calm down?  He got too fucking...  Right.  He got too nervous.  He just freaks out.  Travis, reports coming in you blew Greg Norman.  Is this true? 
[00:12:30]  I can't confirm that.  Did you?  Oh, okay.  Maybe you blew the shark.  You don't like any of the Asian golfers, Travis?  No, I'm not a Y.E. Yang fan.  You're not a Y.E. Yang?  That's the hat he was wearing when Travis blew him.  We're looking at the classic Greg Norman with his dumb, almost cowboy hat.  I would imagine that's the Australian version of the cowboy hat.  Yeah, that is.  How about you just wear a cowboy hat?  That's the outback look.  Right.  So...  The shack. 
[00:13:00]  He was huge for a while.  The shack?  Yeah.  He sure was.  Remember that Bill Clinton broke his fucking, like, ankle over his house?  Wasn't that over his house?  I think Greg Norman was having some of his own wine and then might have tripped down the stairs.  I think that's what it was.  What, they blamed it on Jack?  Yeah, like, I think Bill Clinton was visiting him and, yeah, they were up drinking.  A little hammered.  I forgot what the story was.  Yeah, I don't remember anymore.  Good old Clinton. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, those were good days.  You see how thin Clinton looked during Chelsea Clinton's wedding?  Thin as a pin.  Chelsea Clinton's not a looker, huh?  No.  She can lose all the weight she wants, but...  She, uh...  That's not gonna get rid of years of hurt.  No, she went through her really wacky phase as a child in the White House, and then she  got out and went through that phase where it's like, oh, well, she's just a, you know,  a little kid, and then she just, oof.  You know what? 
[00:14:00]  I mean...  She's making her mom's faces, where she opens...  They catch her just opening her mouth and going like, oh!  Yeah, yeah, like that.  The big eyes, the pointing, the mouth open.  Mouth open.  Oh, my God, that's a carbon copy.  Wow.  Maybe if Hillary had that mouth open a little more.  Yeah, well...  I think she does, but there's a big pubis.  There goes the microphone.  I love when that happens.  Actually, Chelsea looks way better with long hair because you can kind of hide stuff. 
[00:14:30]  I hate the girls that chop their hair, and then you realize there's a lot more hurt underneath.  There's some damage that could have been covered up.  Right.  That hair is very important.  She looks really good there.  Yeah, she don't look bad.  She looks very doable in that picture, but that's a few years ago.  Easy.  Yeah.  And who did she want to marry?  That was a big gala wedding, wasn't it?  She married a Jew.  Did she marry a Jew?  She married a Jew.  A Jew. 
[00:15:00]  How did Bill Clinton feel about that one?  I know he likes the blacks, but does he like the Jew?  The Jew.  That's good.  Good for her.  Tiger Woods could suck a dick.  Here goes Craig.  Aw, shit.  Craig?  What's going on?  I just want to know your opinion on Tiger Woods in this week's tournament.  You're kidding, right?  Not at all.  That's how we started the show today.  Come on.  That was the whole fucking first break.  Are you just getting in your car? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I just got in my car.  Oh, all right.  No, I was just...  We got to repeat it for one guy?  I said how he's sucking up the joint in a tournament that he wins easily year after year.  Yeah, he's won it seven times.  Ten strokes off the lead after the first round.  I'm giving it to Mickelson, but we'll see.  Maybe Bubba.  Probably Bubba.  Bubba Watson, man.  What do you think?  Bubba Watson?  See, you don't know.  You got to follow golf, man.  It's getting good again, I'm telling you.  Got a lot of younger players coming up. 
[00:16:00]  I know, from Travis.  I found out.  Young and cute.  I'm waiting for Tiger to completely have a meltdown on the golf course.  I think it's coming.  Oh, where he just loses his mind and starts fucking throwing clubs?  Have you ever lost your mind to a point where you know everyone is looking at you  and completely embarrassed for you?  Oh, yeah.  And you even know it in the middle of your freakout?  Like, wow, this is really looking stupid for everybody, isn't it?  Awkward.  I look all silly.  I have a feeling Tiger's going to do that. 
[00:16:30]  Just break every club one by one in front of everybody.  He might need that just to get that fucking aggression out.  Yeah, you know?  Yeah, because he's too calm about everything.  Yeah, yeah, he needs to fucking have a blowout and then just take a breath  and get back to fucking playing golf.  That's going to come out somehow, right?  Yeah, it's got to.  He should strangle somebody in the gallery, just something.  Choke a bitch.  Completely insane.  Just choke a bitch in the gallery.  That had to rule.  Just purposefully drive a fucking ball a thousand miles an hour 
[00:17:00]  right into the crowd right next to him.  Purposely?  That's what he's doing in this tournament.  I mean, like, fucking shank one so six feet off the tee.  Oh, I see.  It just goes into someone's head.  How about all of a sudden, right before he's driving, he just starts rotating.  Yeah, just turns.  Just rotates.  Watch people panic.  Rotates 90 degrees.  What is Tiger doing?  Ah, that'd roll.  All right, Craig, let's go to Frank in Jersey.  Frank.  Hey, boys, how you doing?  Let's talk Tiger Woods.  Really?  We did it already. 
[00:17:30]  What's wrong with you guys?  I love Tiger Woods.  Do you love him?  Oh, I love him to death.  You know that.  I love the fact that he had such a great run, and it's pretty amazing, but I don't know,  man.  I think his better days are behind him.  I think he stopped up.  He needs some girl from the Waffle House to clean out his plumbing, I think.  Are people just fucking doing it in?  I don't know.  We did that joke.  I know, yeah.  We said she's sitting there waiting for him.  Yeah.  She's more than willing to take the fucking poison.  Where you been?  Where you been?  I'm hiding out, but I'm waiting for more Tiger stuff to come out. 
[00:18:00]  You know what it is?  There's times you're calling and you just can't get on, but that's all right.  How have you guys been?  All right.  How's fatherhood, Hope?  Fatherhood's great.  Is this your friend?  Yeah, he just wants to talk.  Here, I'll give out my cell number.  We'll talk later.  I mean, it's not a good conversation for the radio, huh?  No, it's all right.  Personal conversation.  I mean, I bring the kid stuff onto the show when I feel like it might be interesting for 
[00:18:30]  a few people out there.  I have nothing to add today.  You want Obie's number?  You guys could just talk after work?  How is your attitude?  Is your attitude starting to change a little bit as far as because of having a kid and  just seeing what that does to you?  That's a good question.  What do you mean, attitude?  Fair question.  Fair question.  In what way?  Well, attitude just about life.  I mean, now there's something.  You know, I've been on the show before talking to you guys, and I have two boys that are 13  and 15, and they just, they're my world. 
[00:19:00]  You know, and as you get older, I coach, and I can see some of the same things happening  with you guys.  I mean, hey, you're still going to be crazy, and you're still going to do what you do,  but having a kid, it changes your attitude about life and about what you do.  Yeah, having a kid makes you realize that you're going to fucking die.  Oh, fuck.  Sounds like a joy.  What a treasure.  I think up to this point, you kind of blow off the whole death thing, like, ah.  And then you see this little thing.  Well, who was saying that?  You're like, oh, fuck, man.  This is...  A comic was saying that. 
[00:19:30]  It's like, that's your replacement.  Right.  You just have your fucking replacement right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know what happens?  After a while, the diapers go away, and the kid becomes fun, and you start doing Little  League and basketball and all that other kind of stuff, and you're like, hey, no, this  ain't so bad.  This is pretty cool being that.  Listen to the great Santini here on the phone.  Right.  As you throw the basketball in his face.  Yeah.  Nah.  You're going to squirt?  You're going to squirt?  I didn't hear you in the broadcast yesterday.  What did you, Anthony, did you do anything to those guys building your barbecue?  Did you fuck them up a little bit, or what? 
[00:20:00]  Not quite.  I couldn't quite tune in to our show and broadcast it via remote to my backyard to goof on the  Mexicans that are building my barbecue.  Oh, you've got to figure out a way to do that, man.  Oh, I do.  Yeah.  We should get a brick out here just listening to that.  You want my number?  Maybe we could talk.  All of us.  We'll conference.  Yeah, sure, man.  Travis, what about you?  Are you a cute young boy that plays golf?  You can talk to Travis.  Hey, you should hold the O.B. Anthony golf outing and have, like, Stalker Patty and all 
[00:20:30]  those guys out there.  Why don't we do that?  I would love a golf outing.  I mean, that would be kind of niche, obviously, but I think we have enough listeners that would  get into something like that.  Guys, you would have a blast.  Maybe we get the topless caddies.  Yeah, you get some strippers out there, a hole-in-one.  You get a hole-in-one.  All right, Frank.  Pipe cleaning station.  That would be cool.  All right, Frank.  Good phone call.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, fellas.  Take care.  Have a great day.  All right, brother.  Let's say hi to Bill and George. 
[00:21:00]  You might as well continue with calls for a second here.  Bill.  Hey, I'm glad you're back, Opie.  I can't say how much, but Tiger said on the course yesterday that the only good thing he  did was keep his cool.  Yeah, but you see it in his eyes.  He's ready to lose his fucking mind.  I'm just hoping he does it on TV in front of everybody because it's got to come out.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, I think that's what he was getting at.  He wanted to blow his stack, but he was able to hold it in yesterday because he said that  was the only good thing that he did do.  See, I'm glad we're talking about this today because something is bubbling with Tiger Woods. 
[00:21:30]  Ten strokes out after the first round in a real easy tournament, and as he sprays more  and more fucking drives into the woods, you see it.  He's ready to fucking have a nervous breakdown in front of everybody because this is all  he knows, and he gave up everything for this, and he's not doing well at it.  Yeah.  His wife supposedly wanted him not to play at all this year to maybe try to work some  shit out, and that was the last straw with her when he said, no, I've got to go back 
[00:22:00]  and start playing.  He likes fucking whores and golf.  Yeah, which I understand.  But the problem is, he can't fuck the whores, and his golf game sucks.  And now he can't play golf the way he used to.  So what has he got?  He's not even having his wife anymore, so he has no release.  Right.  Wow.  Right.  I'm telling you, something is happening with Tiger, and it's going to come out soon.  What's he doing?  What's he doing for pussy?  Like, honestly, what could he do?  He can't...  He probably has a friend with benefits.  He's got to be...  A friend with benefits.  Probably some, like... 
[00:22:30]  He's probably got a four.  He's got to be destroyed.  A four or five that she's like, look, you know, even if I told my story, no one cares  because I know I'm ugly.  He's got to be discreet.  Because we only want the stories from the pretty ones.  He could get a shepherd.  Huh?  He could get a dog.  A dog?  What's wrong with you?  Do what?  Fucking dog.  Oh, have sex with a dog?  Yeah, nobody...  Dog wouldn't talk.  Did you see the dog humping video I tweeted yesterday with the old broad?  Where the old broad's getting, yeah, humped. 
[00:23:00]  It's been going around?  I'm convinced that old broad...  Did that guy hang up?  Good.  That means I didn't have to do it.  What a conversational douchebag.  On my Twitter, OP Radio, this old broad's getting humped by a dog out of nowhere.  It's not one of those bestiality fucking videos.  And my thought is that this old woman is really enjoying getting humped by the fucking dog.  Any attention.  They're going to some kind of place where women go to chat. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my God.  And the dog just goes at it.  Oh, Jesus, yeah.  The dog is on two legs.  Oh, my God.  Why did she get on the ground?  Oh, it's completely fucking her.  And then she gets into the...  Oh, my God.  How did she get into position?  She loves it.  It's called the doggy position for a reason, you dumb boy.  Why did she get into that position?  The dog's got a giant heart on. 
[00:24:00]  You got to think the old lady enjoyed that.  She fell down.  Well, the dog...  And then got on all fours.  Right.  The worst position ever.  That's the only position the dog understands.  Oh, that dog is getting something.  You know she's feeling that hard dog dick right on her ass, though.  Right on her button.  Right on her dirty button.  What do you think? 
[00:24:30]  You think she enjoyed that a little bit?  Why did she get into that position?  I don't know.  Wow.  While we're on my Twitter, can you click on this lunatic point blank J9?  Janine.  A lot of the hardcore listeners know Janine.  Janine was taking a little shit yesterday from Jimmy Norton.  Well, because we want to dress Jimmy Norton up as Prince Poppycock from America's Got Talent,  for the people watching that show.  If you're not watching the show, you can Google it to see what that lunatic looks like. 
[00:25:00]  And Jimmy goes, no, I need a professional makeup artist to make me into Prince Poppycock.  So Janine was insulted, so she decided to turn herself into Princess Poppycunt last night.  And the picture's up on my Twitter.  Poppycunt.  She's insane.  It looks good.  But she's insane.  I think she did a good job.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's certifiable.  That's why I like hanging out with her.  Yeah, she's pretty funny.  I like hanging out with the crazies.  Wow.  That's not bad. 
[00:25:30]  She's got the white pancake makeup on and the big wig and the rouge and, of course,  the trademark Betty Boop-type lips.  Right, the small lips.  Yeah, yeah.  You make your big lips look like that.  Right in the middle of your face.  Right in the middle of a pucker.  It looks like you're just puckered up.  Jimmy James, Tiger's balls must be so swollen it's throwing off his swing.  You think his big black balls are filled with cum?  Why do they have to be colored? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Why do you have to say what color his balls are?  His big black balls filled with cum.  Black balls.  Can't get that swing right.  No, that would be hard to swing with giant cum-filled balls.  But he's one of these Buddhist guys.  Yeah.  So maybe you don't whack it.  So you're thinking the whole meditation.  You keep that poison inside and control it, right?  Yeah, meditation instead of masturbation. 
[00:26:30]  You just sit there and meditate.  Think about Buddha and get calm, peace.  Om.  You do that whole thing.  And then you go out and shoot shitty golf because your balls are full of cum.  Your black balls are full of cum.  Your big black balls.  Big black balls.  Oh, you know what?  Dan in Albany.  Yeah, buddy.  Hey, Anthony. 
[00:27:00]  Yes, sir.  Did you go into a little slump when you had to pay out your black boys?  Because that's probably a little bit of what he's going through.  I don't know if they went through any kind of slump.  That would have been a long-ass slump.  That would have been a nine-year slump, motherfucker.  I had some of the best years of my life.  Now, believe me, during the divorce proceeding, I was very preoccupied.  There's definitely a distraction that happens.  Yeah, definitely distracted.  I was dealing with ridiculous anxiety.  It was just very difficult.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every time he's peeing up, he's thinking about hundreds of millions of dollars. 
[00:27:30]  He has to hurry away.  Yeah, you know something?  He might be thinking about that, too.  You know, everybody goes, oh, well, he's rich.  But unless you're in that situation, you don't want to give up half your money, no matter how much fucking money you have.  I don't think he cares about the money.  He might.  I think he really cares about winning tournaments, and the pressure of him not winning is really starting to get to him.  Yeah, but in order to win, he's got to get that other shit off of his mind.  I guess he does care to a point about the money.  Probably does.  It's not the number one concern.  I don't even think he cares about his kids. 
[00:28:00]  But it's all that shit.  I think he's a robot.  I really do.  He was trained to be this great golfer since the age of five.  He was on Mike Douglas, for Christ's sake, showing his stroke.  You know, he doesn't know how to live like a human being.  I don't know.  It's got to be.  Dude, he likes.  There is an element of humanity in him.  He's got to be going through some shit.  He likes that band.  Coldplay? 
[00:28:30]  I'm a rock star.  Nickelback.  He's a Nickelback fan.  And every band to like out there, Tiger Woods likes Nickelback.  They sell billions of records, but everyone I know hates them.  I don't know how that works.  Yeah.  No one will admit they're a Nickelback fan.  Yeah.  Tiger will, though, because Tiger thinks it's cool.  I'll say they've had a couple of catchy tunes.  They've got catchy songs.  You hear them on the radio, I'm not going to lie to you.  You kind of take a little listen.  Not going to buy a t-shirt? 
[00:29:00]  No, you're not going to admit to your friends that you're a Nickelback fan.  No.  I'd rather admit that I'm into young golfers.  Like Travis.  Like T-Storm.  I think he likes Kings of Leon.  Oh, he probably likes Kings of Leon.  Even though they're fags that won't play because of pigeon dropping.  Yeah, fuck Kings of Leon, too, man.  Our rock stars kept playing after they got poo on them.  Yeah.  Come on.  A little bird poo shuts down the whole band.  What the hell's wrong with these people?  God, you've got to rock. 
[00:29:30]  You like Arcade Fire?  I don't know.  Do I?  Thumbs up from Travis.  Yeah?  Travis?  Travis is a very...  They played Madison Square Garden last night.  Yeah, they played two nights at the Garden.  And they were live on YouTube last night.  What's their big hit?  They don't really have a...  Well, I'll play this on the...  Yeah, they don't really go for...  They don't really care about...  They're one of those bands that don't care about hits, man.  We don't need a hit, man.  You know what I'm scared is going to happen to them, though, 
[00:30:00]  is they're really getting the Radiohead treatment from critics,  where anything they put out is just the most amazing thing you've ever heard.  It's genius.  Yeah, and I've heard the new album, and it's good.  You know what?  But it's not the most amazing thing in the world right now.  I was at a U2 show, and they were cranking Arcade Fire,  the Arcade Fire, I guess, before the concert.  I was like, who the fuck is this?  And then I asked around, and they go,  oh, this is the Arcade Fire, and I've been a fan ever since.  I got to hear a little bit.  You got something, Travis? 
[00:30:30]  Let me hear a little.  Yeah, I've got the song that I think...  I guess the reason I just out of nowhere said Arcade Fire,  I was thinking Kings of Leon and that stupid pigeon  pooing in the, what, the bassist?  Bassist mouth.  Yeah, right in his mouth.  And then they had to stop the show,  and I'm thinking of bands that, you know,  nowadays that wouldn't allow that to happen.  Yeah.  What do you got, Travis?  This is Wake Up.  This has been in a lot of commercials.  Oh, a lot of commercials.  Okay. 
[00:31:00]  They're going to play you an actual song,  but this is probably the most recognizable piece of a song.  Yeah, huh?  They got, like, that anthem thing going.  Yeah.  A little bit there.  Gotcha.  You don't like new music, do you?  No, no, I...  What was the last...  I'm trying to listen to this.  I'm not saying this is their best song, 
[00:31:30]  but it's the most recognizable for the mass population right now.  Wow.  I'm out of it.  You want another one?  No, no, no, no.  I've, uh...  In small doses.  We can't get on an arcade fire fucking...  I've just... 
[00:32:00]  I'm here.  People will turn...  You don't want to do our every month music break?  I fell off the fucking map.  I'm off the radar.  What was the last three...  I say three,  because I just got three albums in the last two days.  Oh, you did?  And I don't know why I call them albums, I guess.  What did you do?  Download them?  I bought one...  iTunes?  I bought one and I stole two.  That's not bad, though.  I used to fucking steal three out of three.  Actual hard discs?  No comment how I steal.  Oh.  Well, okay.  I'm all about the stealing. 
[00:32:30]  I'm all about the stealing.  But now, you know, I figure you should give them some money.  So, one out of three I bought.  That's good.  What about the other guys that you didn't buy?  I figure they just kind of share whatever money...  Oh, it goes into some big pool...  Yeah, and they take their piece.  ...and they just pick and choose.  That's right.  All right.  That's right.  You really...  Is it...  Is it...  When you steal it, is it ending up...  Is the final product on some type of electronic delivery system, or is it still hard disc? 
[00:33:00]  Both.  Hmm.  Because I want it for the car.  I guess I could just...  I don't really have an iPod right now, I realize.  Really?  You don't have any kind of...  I dusted off my iPod the other day.  It looked like a fucking iPad.  This thing is so fucking big.  Hey, the old iPods.  You get an iPhone?  I think my...  I think my...  The little roundy-round thing that you scroll with?  I think I...  Zippy, zippy, zippy.  That's exactly...  Mine still has that.  It does, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, yeah, so...  Those things were the shit when they were the shit.  I'll give you that.  Like, I had one.  Everybody did.  They were great.  You just...  It's like you're dialing a phone.  That's right.  Fantastic.  And then, you know, touchscreen kind of did away with that.  Cover flow.  What was the last thing you stole or bought?  Musically.  Musically?  Like something you heard on the radio and went, man, I gotta fucking go a little deeper  with these guys.  You know something?  See, I'm still a fan of albums. 
[00:34:00]  You know what I mean?  Not just hit songs.  Really?  If I hear a band that has a cool song out, I want to hear the rest of the album to see  what else they got going on.  See, that's the problem.  Because I think that's coming back a little bit right now.  That's the problem with the electronic media is I will use one of the apps.  If I hear a song that I do like, I'll hold it up to the radio.  I'll have the iPhone identify it.  I'll go to iTunes and buy it, not even knowing who the fuck it is. 
[00:34:30]  Wow.  Just knowing that I like the song.  Right.  So I can't even tell you what bands I recently downloaded.  Well, what song then?  I can't even tell you the names of the songs.  Katy Perry?  And then they just play at random.  Katy Perry?  Nicki Minaj?  Yes.  I thought so.  Justin Bieber.  Oh, really?  No.  Oh.  Fuck Bieber and the asshole.  Bieber, yeah.  That's your position.  I fucking hate Bieber.  Bieber fever, really?  Oh.  I would grab him by his you-can't-see-it forehead. 
[00:35:00]  They're making a movie about his life.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are.  Why?  He's 11.  What the fuck has he done with his life yet?  Well, it's going to be in 3D.  No, it's not.  Are you serious?  Know what the sad part is?  The movie will fucking do easily 100 to 200 million.  God.  No problem.  You should horrify the little girls that go and see him by having a 3D cum shot at the  end of the movie.  Just crying.  Justin Bieber, pull some hardcore shit. 
[00:35:30]  I want to know the last song.  You said, fuck, I need this.  I'm trying to remember.  I won't even go with bands or albums.  I really am trying to fucking remember.  Well, I'll tell you my 3 as you're trying to figure it out.  My iPod.  Someone on Twitter turned me on to Crowology.  The Black Crow is kind of a greatest hits acoustic thing.  Awesome.  You were never into the Black Crow, right?  Nah, a little too bluesy and shit for me.  Fuck, I love bluesy shit if it's done right.  Yeah, I'm not really a big bluesy guy. 
[00:36:00]  And then I went with Arcade Fire, the Arcade Fire's latest.  And I went with Silver Sun Pickup.  They have an album called Swoon.  That's pretty cool.  Swoon.  You know Silver Sun?  No.  Give Anthony a little Silver Sun, Travis.  Oh, fuck, you had it right there.  Tell me if you would get into this, Ant.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  They just all sound like good beds.  You know?  You know?  I don't know if I could go and watch this. 
[00:37:00]  Like, I don't know if I could go to a concert and watch this.  All right.  Sound a little Cranberries influence. 
[00:37:30]  I was going to say Billy Corgan.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's some Billy Corgan in there.  He's a fan of the show, even though you trash him every fucking time.  We talk about the Smashing Pumpkins.  He's got a fucking...  Give us a shout-out and you fucking trash him.  He's got a deal.  Is this a broad?  It's probably boring, people.  Is that a broad?  No, that's a dude.  That's a dude singing that?  Yeah.  And when we talk music, I know.  I picked some safe fucking bands right there. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm not going out on a limb with my choices.  The Arcade Fire and Silver Sun, those fucking bands are huge right now.  And then I went old school with some crows.  And you still haven't fucking told me your song.  Because I download a lot of fucking just old shit.  I love...  Kevin from Connecticut says,  I heard Kings of Leon, Sex on Fire, and I had to capture the audio.  I like that term.  Capture the audio.  Capture the audio.  See, that audio's out there. 
[00:38:30]  It's running free, and you've got to capture it.  Capture that shit.  No one says you have to fucking pay for the capturing.  It's all out there.  It's in the air right now.  Right.  It's just flying around.  You've just got to capture it.  And no one knows if I ripped off music or not, by the way.  So go fuck yourselves.  Maybe I bought all three.  Maybe I'm doing this for the radio.  Last new thing?  I think that guy's right.  It might have been the Ting Tings.  Did you get an album?  Yeah, that was a good album.  It wasn't a good album.  They got a new one coming out.  No, no.  The whole album was kind of good.  Yeah, I liked the whole album. 
[00:39:00]  Like, there are the hit ones that you like instantly because they're catchy.  And then other ones that kind of grow on you after a few listens.  But I liked that.  Because I like that snotty fucking sound.  British thing?  That snotty British fucking chick sound is pretty cool.  Yeah.  I like that.  You didn't get Drake's album?  No, I didn't pick up Drake's album.  We don't talk hip hop on this show.  Yeah.  I didn't feel like getting stabbed going and buying it.  He was on a TV show.  He was an actor.  What?  He's not a gangster.  He's on a children's television show. 
[00:39:30]  What show?  Degrassi.  Oh, Degrassi.  Are you serious?  Drake?  Yeah.  He was like a star on Degrassi before he was a rapper.  Drake would happen down by the fucking seaport when he was supposed to fucking be there.  Well, they canceled the show and people got a little upset.  See?  I don't want to be around that type of atmosphere.  It's very unimportant.  But, I mean, he did have an opening band.  Who was opening for him that day?  Hanson.  That's right.  It was the Hanson fans.  Oh, Hanson fans.  Oh, really?  We're the ones throwing chairs at people and breaking windows. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  Wait, he was on a children's show and they riot when he plays music?  He's a shit right now.  He got shot on Degrassi by a white kid?  That's right.  It was a school shooting.  He ended up in a wheelchair.  That's Jimmy Brooks.  Recognize.  Was Degrassi based in Bizarro World where everything is reversed?  No, it was their answer to Columbine.  It was like a school shooting.  You know, the kid got picked on and then he brought a gun to school.  And then he shot Jimmy Brooks, a.k.a. Drake.  I hate that Sam brings his black culture to our show.  He really does bring it. 
[00:40:30]  Why?  We're talking white shit here.  Let's bring everything in.  You know what I'm saying?  And he always brings it back around to, you know, the hip-hop culture.  I just like everything getting included.  Why don't you go across the hall there?  Well, I mean.  Shady.  Yeah, they don't even acknowledge you.  What do you mean they don't acknowledge me?  You have no cred with them over there.  You have as much cred as we do.  Huh?  I'm on a who kid show.  Oh, yeah, you know, he's kind of right.  They don't.  They look at him like a goof, though.  That's all right.  I think Sam is the goofy guy.  He's a token.  Yeah, yeah.  You like being token?  I don't mind.  Don't you have to be white to be token? 
[00:41:00]  Well, I'm white enough over there and black enough over here.  Oh, my God.  You really are just in no man's land, aren't you?  Spectro from Michigan.  Opie downloads songs because he likes them and downloads songs because he wants to fuck them.  Although the Ting Ting girl.  Yeah.  I went to a Jimmy Fallon taping.  Yeah.  And the Ting Tings were playing.  Uh-huh.  What's the matter?  She's a beast.  Really?  Yeah, not that hot in person.  Every picture I saw is kind of...  They know how to sex her up. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, but she's not a looker.  Wow, she looks pretty good right there, though.  No, she looks funny looking cute.  She almost looks like Ivanka Trump in that picture.  I just got fucking...  She don't look bad in that picture.  She don't look bad at all.  That's not what I saw when I watched her live at the Jimmy Fallon taping.  I like that.  You know, I like when English chicks sing and you can actually hear their accent.  Like, that's cool.  Because some people, their accent just went away.  Like the Beatles.  They would sing songs and be like, but they're English. 
[00:42:00]  They're Liverpoolians.  Anthony, ready for this one?  Brian Shea, Pittsburgh.  I know you hate Scott Weiland now, but the new STP is awesome.  Is it?  I used to be one of the biggest STP fans.  I've seen STP.  I know, I remember you announcing them.  STP!  I'll do it for you today.  I probably have seen STP over the years easily ten times.  Easily.  Easily.  But Scott Weiland is such a cocksucker that I can't stand the band now.  I can't listen to...  Wow, his personality got you to hate the band. 
[00:42:30]  Only time in the history of loving music.  That's fucked up when that happens.  The only one.  And we've met a lot of assholes on this show.  You gotta fuck up.  I can't even listen to the old shit anymore.  That your personality makes you not like the music.  Yeah, he is a douche.  I hear the album's good, too.  I did give it a listener, too.  Think you might come back?  Who?  Think you might come back to...  STP.  STP, because of the music?  Whatever, probably.  You know who I hated for years?  I'm not gonna go through life hating the fucking guy, but he is a real douchebag. 
[00:43:00]  Because of personality?  You know who I hated for years?  You, too.  I couldn't stand the Bono that was just like the political Bono.  Like, he's still involved in all that shit,  but I think he realizes now, in this day and age,  it's like, you know, let me just shut up and write fucking pop songs.  It's a little rough.  Yeah.  Back in the day, everything was like, you know...  He's still doing it.  It's a little rough.  I've seen U2 easily 20 times.  Yeah.  That's been my number one band forever. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  I always go back to U2.  And I saw him last fall at Giant Stadium.  Had to be over 100,000 people there.  Yeah.  I got sort of good seats, and I still was probably a quarter mile from the stage.  And he's talking about this and that as I'm sitting there going,  we all spent well over $200.  Yeah.  A ticket to see, you fuck.  How about you take half this money that you made today only and give it to the world?  And what was he, like, in between songs, he starts rambling about some cause? 
[00:44:00]  He's still rambling, yeah.  You're kind of tuning him out after a while.  Yeah.  Honestly, I don't even know what he was rambling about last tour.  I really don't.  But he always has something.  You just hear blah, blah, blah, blah, until you hear one of the Edge's riffs start.  Exactly.  And then, okay, I'm back.  Exactly.  I'm back.  Yeah, okay, I'm back.  But the Edge fucked me up because that documentary we talked about, you remember the name?  And have you seen it since we talked about it?  The one with Jimmy Page and Mike Get Loud.  Mike Get Loud is a great movie. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, it's on demand.  I checked it out.  All right.  For the people out there that are really into music, fucking check out Mike Get Loud.  It's amazing.  It's Jimmy Page, Jack White, who's awesome, who played here in New York last night.  Tall drink of water, that man.  Who else?  Bono and...  Yeah, it's Jack White, Jimmy Page, and The Edge.  Yeah, okay, The Edge, Jack White, Jimmy Page.  Wasn't there somebody else?  No, it's just the three.  Okay, those three. 
[00:45:00]  And when The Edge showed one of his complicated riffs and showed how simple it was before it  went into his shit, his shitbox.  All of his pedals and shit, yeah.  I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.  This guy could barely play the guitar.  The people that saw the documentary know exactly what I'm talking about.  If you could find that online, it'd be great.  My brother, of course, in the U2 tribute band 2U, you could go to notutube.com.  Sure.  Was he playing Disney or something? 
[00:45:30]  I follow him on Twitter now, too.  Playing the Epcot for like a week or something like that, right?  Yeah.  Huge crowds, too.  You were out there.  Yeah.  I was there the same time.  Travis was there.  Wait, you saw him?  Yeah.  Down at Disney?  Yeah.  They get huge crowds.  There's some people that go there just to see them.  Yeah, it's fucked up.  Yeah, they had a group of people in the front.  It was the big theater at the American Pavilion over there.  Yeah, they get the big stage.  Yeah.  Joe has the potential of just camping out in one city and doing this. 
[00:46:00]  I know.  All of a sudden, Vegas or Disney says, you know what?  No, we're hiring you for the next two.  We're going to give you a two-year contract to play every fucking day.  They had him for like a week here, and then he goes down and plays South America for  a few days or a week.  Yeah, it's fucked up.  It's a cover band.  And people are loving him in Disney, Travis?  Yeah, they play like three half-hour sets a day, and they get the rest of the day to  just do whatever you want.  And Joe said on his Twitter, they treat him like a rock star too, right?  It's hysterical.  Whatever he wants.  And they've just got this group of people in the front that are just going nuts for 
[00:46:30]  2U.  Like, 2U, not U2.  Yeah, yeah.  They're huge 2U fans.  And yeah, they drew really impressive crowds there.  That's great.  They're really good.  I haven't seen him in a couple years.  I'm sure he's even upped his game since.  And then they go to the Irish Pavilion and sit and drink some Guinness.  Right.  Make like they're really U2.  What were you saying about Joe, though?  And the Edge?  Yeah.  My brother wound up getting, like, effect for effect everything the Edge has. 
[00:47:00]  So he could sound just like the Edge with all the equipment.  And he's saying the same thing.  He's like, you know, you play something and go, this is what it sounds like.  And then here's how you Edgify it.  And then it's just that big U2 guitar sound.  Right.  Well, he invented his own fucking sound.  Yeah, yeah.  It's his sound.  So whatever the fuck you're using.  But this documentary, and he admitted it.  He goes, well, a lot of these riffs are actually really basic. 
[00:47:30]  That's fantastic, Rob.  Uh, all right.  Go for him.  Oh, really?  I got to go to Chris in Nashville.  Because I think we just came up with kind of a good show topic.  A band you used to love, and then somebody in the band is such a jerk  that you just don't like the band anymore.  A jerk.  Go ahead, Chris.  Eddie Vedder is a jerk.  Really?  I used to love going to Pearl Jam shows.  And now every time you go, you have to hear a 15-minute political speech, you know, 
[00:48:00]  about whatever's going on.  Is Eddie Vedder still doing that, too?  He's getting up there and being all political, man?  Well, every night.  I, uh, I'm a big Pearl Jam fan.  Not so much in recent years.  I don't know a lot of what they're up to these days.  Yeah.  I hear stuff here and there.  Uh, but here's something.  Never seen Pearl Jam live.  Hmm.  I don't know.  And I love, I love their old stuff, especially.  But he's too political.  Oh, he left.  He was a lot worse during, uh, the Bush administration. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, like, talking, like, during concerts about political stuff.  Yeah, but, uh, I saw them three, two months ago.  Yeah.  And...  Is he still cool?  Oh, he's awesome.  He's the best.  Is he cool?  Yes, he's very cool.  He still has his hair, man.  He grew his hair back out, and he's awesome.  Right.  Uh, but he said one thing about the Arizona immigration law that lasted...  Man!  It lasted 20 seconds, and that was it.  And that's, that's good enough for me.  Did he say he's for it and get those lousy Mexicans out of the country? 
[00:49:00]  That's exactly what he said, yeah.  But, yeah, ever since Bush been out of the office, he's...  Yeah, he's really got nothing to complain about, nothing to say.  Yeah, good for him.  And they're awesome lives, so...  I'm still waiting for Ant, uh, to come up with a song he likes right now.  I, uh...  You like the Gaga?  I do not like the Gaga.  I'm not a fan of the Lady Gaga.  Hmm.  Which doesn't mean I wouldn't get a new song.  I just don't like Gaga. 
[00:49:30]  She's got a strong song.  Shut it.  Make sure you listen to this fine channel over the weekend for the Countdown show,  because I guarantee the Patrice, Anthony, Lady Gaga bit will be right up there.  Oh, is that fun?  Patrice had me pissing my pants as they sing.  It was fucking hilarious.  Oh, and Popeye, yeah.  Kurt, love, thank you.  Huh?  Popeye, Gaga.  People have been telling me...  Oh, that was at the end of the bit.  That was really funny, too.  ...how you can do anything.  Now you can incorporate Popeye into anything.  Right.  Yeah, Popeye fits.  Fuck it. 
[00:50:00]  Step up 3D.  Step up 3D in theaters right now, people.  What are you waiting for?  It's not a live read.  It's just what we're passionate about.  No, this isn't anything.  It's just...  You're such a dick.  I cannot wait to go to the movies tonight.  Tonight.  I am going opening night.  I've got to see Step Up 3D.  Maybe this afternoon.  That way you don't have to worry about sellouts.  Oh.  Go straight from here to the movie theater.  Yeah, but you know what? 
[00:50:30]  I want to be in a crowd.  I got you.  I'm with you.  It's one of those movies where you're kind of...  You feel the energy of the theater.  You all cheer at the...  Yeah!  Cheering.  You know what I like in a movie theater?  Diversity.  Yeah.  That's why I like sitting in a big movie theater that has a diverse crowd so I can enjoy the  movie and see what other cultures, how they feel about...  When they point it out to you?  I guess.  When they fucking don't shut up and point things out to me on the screen that I'm seeing. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, God.  3D, my ass.  That stupid Step Up.  Be dancing in your face.  In your face, motherfucker.  Fuck 3D.  I saw some of that shit.  Some of the moves they're doing, and then they kick, and their shoe is right in your fucking  face.  I'm saying.  That's cool.  Crazy, right?  Oh, insanity.  I want to fucking...  Are you going to go see...  Strangle fucking...  What's his name?  Cameron.  Fucking...  James Cameron. 
[00:51:30]  I want to fucking strangle James Cameron for really bringing 3D to the forefront.  Where every movie has to be in 3D now?  Everything now has to be in 3D for no reason.  Like, Step Up 3 doesn't have to be in 3D.  It doesn't.  No, it doesn't help.  How does it help?  Look, man.  In a franchise, you get to that third movie, you got to put it in 3D.  Look, they're doing what...  I just saw...  Jaws started that shit.  Blame Jaws.  Is it Jaws?  But that was old school 3D. 
[00:52:00]  That was like...  That was the fad.  But what do you call your movie if you get to the third movie?  Step Up 3?  Doesn't sound good.  Name it's...  As good as Step Up 3D.  Don't put...  Jaws 3...  D.  D.  Don't put a number after the title from the original movie.  Because it's just 3D.  I would rather have the title and then a subtitle.  Like, To the Streets?  Right.  Anything worse when you were walking through Blockbuster?  Nah, I would go back a few years. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And you're looking for a good movie and all of a sudden you see, like, Smokey and the Bandit  and you get excited, let's say.  I'm just...  Oh.  ...reaching.  Yeah.  But then it says 2.  Or 3, even worse.  Or 3.  Wow.  All of a sudden you're like, oh, Jaws, haven't seen in a while.  Oh, yeah.  2.  2.  Blues Brothers 2.  Oof.  Or whatever.  Oof.  I like how they're doing the Matrix move.  There's somebody dancing and he kicks the water and it freezes and then it spins around a 
[00:53:00]  little Matrix-y and I'm sure the water is just in yo' face.  Yeah, you might have to check.  Oh, the bubbles.  In yo' face.  Look at that.  Abs coming right at ya.  Yeah.  Was that pussy coming right at me?  That's right.  It was like abs.  What's wrong with the pussy coming right at ya?  Was that pussy?  Let me see.  Was that pussy coming right at ya?  Yeah?  Yeah.  In your face.  That might be good.  You know what they're trying to tell ya?  Pull your dick out and make like it's gonna land on it.  They're saying, take a lick.  No one's a little lucky.  That's right.  Take a lick at that pussy.  Some movies don't need the 3D. 
[00:53:30]  It's just a distraction and stupid.  And I would say this is that movie.  Although I would never see this anyway.  You don't think the upcoming Yogi Bear movie needs to be in 3D?  What is that about?  Yeah, what's going on with the...  Have you seen the trailer for that?  No.  The Yogi Bear movie.  Wait, I like that list you just said.  Dan Aykroyd is voicing Yogi Bear.  Is it animated?  Computer animated?  It's computer animated.  Yogi Bear. 
[00:54:00]  Who's Boo Boo?  Justin Timberlake.  Aykroyd should take a page out of Belushi's book.  Oh shit.  And die?  Or stop making movies.  Gulliver's Travels is getting the 3D treatment at the end of the year.  Oh God.  Oh, enough.  Smurfs 3D.  Piranha 3D.  That's going to be a good one.  Well, that's...  We're going to have Ving Rhames in.  That's right.  It's going to be a great movie.  The great Ving Rhames.  The great Ving Rhames, as you might remember from such movies as Pulp Fiction. 
[00:54:30]  What?  And Dawn of the Dead.  All right, Ving Rhames.  Ving Rhames.  He'll be on next week.  Plus Piranha 3D, I think he's going to be a sleeper hit.  What?  No.  Wow.  Piranha 3D will be a fun goof movie for some people.  3D.  Is there going to be the big scene where the piranhas are biting at the screen and you're  going, oh, they're right here in the theater.  Thank God I'm in a movie theater and not in the water. 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  We've got to get rid of these piranhas.  Like, what?  What's he going to do?  Oh, he's going to...  Oh, here's the Yogi Bear trailer?  That's right.  All right.  Let me hear some of this.  Hmm.  Of course, this preview is...  As soon as I hear Dan Aykroyd trying to do Yogi fucking Bear, I'm going to lose my mind.  Welcome to the 100th anniversary of Johnny Stone!  I see some live action here. 
[00:55:30]  What an unusual brown bear.  Brown bear?  One that talks.  Those are so rare.  None that I can think of.  I smell PB&J.  I think he's trying to steal your lunchbox.  Oh, no.  I'm okay.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Take it, Google.  Kicking it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Lock down the park.  Repeat.  Lock down the park.  CJ.  Jones.  You know I'm the only other ranger here, right? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.  Bubu and I would never think of disturbing a family's picnic.  Oh.  I wonder if he noticed the pie.  You do come up with some good plans, Yogi.  Here we go.  That's because I'm smarter than the average bear.  Yogi, grab my paw.  Ow!  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:56:30]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  I'm so smarter.  I'm so smarter.  Yogi Bear.  In 3D.  Of course.  This isn't going to make me look fat, is it?  Oh, boy.  He doesn't sound anything like Yogi Bear.  No.  No.  Isn't that one of the easiest impressions to do?  It seems to be.  And Dan Aykroyd can't do it?  This, I'm disillusioned with the world.  It makes you feel like you could be a movie star, though, you know? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, doesn't it?  I feel like I could be a movie star.  I think I could do that.  I could be that dumb ranger.  Ranger Smith?  I could easily do that.  I'm Ranger Smith.  They should have Ranger Smith from The Matrix.  In 3D.  No, stop.  We're not going to watch trailers now.  For Smurfs?  Smurfs?  3D?  No.  No.  We're not going to do that.  You sure?  Yes.  All right.  Why don't we...  Oh, wait.  This guy actually saw Piranha 3D. 
[00:57:30]  What?  Yeah, this guy was fortunate enough to see his screenings.  There's no spoilers.  Randy, Jersey, you saw the movie?  Yeah, I saw it about eight months ago.  There was a screening in Jersey.  It wasn't in 3D, though, but it was a free screening.  And it was terrible.  It was absolutely terrible.  Oh, shit.  They probably changed it.  Yeah, maybe you saw the early one.  The director was there.  The director was in the audience.  I honestly think two people left.  And we had to review it after it was over.  But the only good thing is Christopher Lloyd is in it as some, like, crazy pet shop owner. 
[00:58:00]  So he's funny, but it was awful.  Like, really awful.  I can't see how it's going to make money.  Well, if you saw the movie eight months ago, and it's only coming out, what, next week or two weeks from now?  Yeah.  That's not a good sign.  They probably changed all the bad parts.  Yeah, maybe they did.  Yeah, they listened to the audience who probably gave their opinions.  Then they added a third dimension.  Changed it.  Yeah, they went 3D. 
[00:58:30]  Maybe it wasn't even supposed to go 3D.  And they said, you know what, slap some 3D onto this shit.  What happens with Matt Hooper?  I don't even know who is that.  I don't even know.  How do you not know Matt Hooper?  Richard Dreyfuss is in it, too.  For about that.  You did not just say that.  You just did not do that to yourself.  Oh, my God, you idiot.  You didn't do that.  Do you know?  I'm only 30, man.  I'm only 30 years old.  I don't remember the Richard Dreyfuss.  You're 30 years old.  Fucking Jaws. 
[00:59:00]  You should know Jaws.  What fucking Jaws is.  Everyone should know Jaws.  God damn.  Damn movie holds up.  All right, peace.  All right.  Peace.  He goes, but Richard Dreyfuss.  Yeah, Matt Hooper?  What happens with Matt Hooper?  I don't know.  I don't know who that is.  But Richard Dreyfuss is in it.  Right.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks.  Who hasn't seen Jaws?  I don't care.  I'm about 30.  Fucking Jaws, motherfucker.  30-year-olds should know Jaws.  Of course.  Sam, you're what?  Late 20s now?  26.  You're only 26? 
[00:59:30]  Wow.  I'll be 27 in one month from today.  He was fucking...  Remember when he was 13 when he first started with us?  Yeah.  A little 13-year-old Sam.  I was.  I had to have a permission slip every day when he came in.  I wasn't that young.  Yeah.  No, no.  I remember that.  All right.  Totally.  Please.  I remember your mom used to drop you off.  Yeah.  Yes.  With your lunchbox.  Drop you off.  And you'd be like, Mom, could you leave me at the corner?  Not in front of the building.  No kisses.  But she didn't trust me in New York City on my own.  No, the big city. 
[01:00:00]  She still doesn't.  That's right.  I bet she still gets all scared.  I would bet money that your mom drops you off to this day.  No, I drive in.  I would bet money.  She worries.  No one has ever seen you fucking drive in.  Prove it.  So you want to get here a little earlier and watch her drive in?  Does she watch you?  Oh, he just gave you a fucking dig right there, by the way.  Oh, fucking no.  I don't want to.  That wasn't bad.  He's implying that you come in late.  Right.  No, later, not late.  You guys get in here plenty of time to put on a great show.  How old are you?  Wow.  I'm 26.  I'll be 27 in one month from today. 
[01:00:30]  Wow, really?  You know that I...  Rats.  Oh.  What?  What were you thinking?  I started radio a few years before you were born.  Oh.  Ooh.  Wow.  I was born in 1983.  Yeah, that's right around the time.  Right around the time, actually.  Yeah.  And I'll be 27 in one month.  I was already legally drinking.  Oh.  Really? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Sam wasn't even born, and I'm fucking down in Jack Daniels and beers with my friends.  Wow.  You're so much older than me.  Oh, my God.  It's just crazy.  It's just crazy.  Can we take a break now?  Yeah.  We're my goddamn sandwich, motherfucker.  We need some sambos.  N-word has to eat.  I hear you.  As they say.  N-word gotta eat.  Ooh, just in a nick of time.  I didn't want anybody to hear the wrong word.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Now, I got a thought.  No Jim Norton today, because he's playing the improv in Tampa Bay. 
[01:01:30]  Yes.  If you're in that area, please see Jimmy.  You'll have a very, very good time.  And a big thank you to Cowhead down there in Tampa, treating Jimmy and Kenny really, really  well.  That's very nice.  He had some pressure behind the scenes not to treat Jimmy and Kenny really well.  Really?  And he did the right thing, because he actually is a fan of our show.  Good man.  Yeah, because there's a Bubba thing happening down there.  A what?  Who? 
[01:02:00]  I'm hearing rumors.  What?  The person that told me these rumors should fucking grow a set and say it on the fucking  air.  Why don't you get a pair?  Instead of whispering like an old fucking lady in my ear every morning.  You know what I heard?  Gossip, gossip, gossips.  But supposedly there was some pressure behind the scenes not to have Jimmy and Kenny on  Cowhead's show yesterday.  All right.  Now I know who it is.  Of course you know.  Who else would it be?  Sam just popped up a picture. 
[01:02:30]  I should start the rumor of the day on Twitter, because I get one every fucking day from this  kid.  But he's not brave enough to bring it on the air.  He's a huge fan of Bubba.  That's the only clue.  You think?  That's the only clue.  I'll tell you.  So supposedly Bubba behind the scenes was pressuring Cowhead and threatening him to not have Norton  and Kenny on the show.  Why?  Why would you do that?  Like real pressure.  Stop it.  And threats.  And Cowhead said, fuck that. 
[01:03:00]  These guys have always been cool to me.  And Jimmy's great for your show.  If you got Jimmy on your show, it's fucking a good move.  And he put Jimmy on.  And so make sure you see Jimmy at the Tampa Improv this weekend, okay?  Yes.  And where's E-Rock hiding?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What does E-Rock have to do with that?  Oh, yeah.  What does E-Rock have to do with it?  What does E-Rock have to do with it?  Oh, my God.  Is he?  Wait a minute.  Oh.  Florida's number one son.  Shit.  Where is he? 
[01:03:30]  Is he hiding?  I mean, he probably figured that this conversation didn't relate to him.  It's some mystery man who gave you these rumors.  Here he comes walking down the hall with his head down.  Aw.  Look at him.  Now he's trying to walk with his head held high.  With his head held high.  He is doing a I am woman, hear me roar walk.  And D-Boy is cheering him on.  Yeah, yeah.  D-Boy is clapping as he comes in.  And D-Boy just made it to work.  And he's got a good story today.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What, his train was delayed because it fucking killed somebody today? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Can we get into that after the break?  Sure.  Love to hear about that.  E-Rock.  Now, I had to call you out today because you give me a rumor every fucking day in radio,  which I appreciate because, you know, I'm a student of this business.  So I do like the fact that you know what's going on out there.  But fucking tell Ant what you told me this morning.  Oh, what the guy who told me said, hey, please don't mention it on the air.  You didn't tell me that part.  Yeah, I did.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Who, Cowhead said not to mention it on the air? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Oops.  Oh.  Sorry, we were just about to go to break the line first.  I don't remember hearing the don't mention it on the air thing.  Yeah.  I really never remember.  That probably was an important part.  Yeah, I haven't.  That was the first thing I said to you.  But I've never really listened to that advice.  I've adhered to the don't.  Ever.  Yeah.  So what?  Bubba's pressuring Cowhead behind the scenes?  Yeah, I guess.  Because he wanted Jimmy on his show?  He got upset that he was promoting, that Jimmy was coming down to Tampa, Jimmy was coming  on a show, and...  Look in the end, asshole.  We're all fucking working for the same company. 
[01:05:00]  I know.  Relax.  Stop.  You don't have to love the fucking guy, but to pressure someone not to have Jimmy on their  show is ridiculous.  Well, some of us are working for this company.  Oh, he's not working for the company anymore?  The one day he has to do live for this company, and he seems to be off a lot.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I hear he's getting fired anyway.  Well, I don't know.  Or not.  Eric's upset because he uses SiriusXM to listen to Bubba.  Yeah, not true.  He's a big fan.  Yeah, not true. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, not true.  Well, the point being, Norton's at the Improv in Tampa Bay.  Yes.  And he'll be on Cowhead again today.  Oh, good.  Good.  Make sure you check that out if you're in the Tampa area.  All right, man.  Oh, oh, my idea.  Yeah, so Jimmy's not here.  You know Oscar's here today.  Oscar the intern.  Oscar.  Who is just fantastic.  We introduced everybody to Oscar last week.  Yeah.  Well, we're thinking maybe.  Nervous Nelly he is.  We're thinking maybe we give him a shot at third mic today.  Wow. 
[01:06:00]  Do you know how huge that is for an intern to be able to just come in and take over Jimmy's  seat as third mic?  Yeah.  What an opportunity.  You want to do it after the break?  To show his showcase some of his talent.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you tell me he has 10 minutes to get ready?  We'll give him eight minutes.  Eight minutes to get ready for his big fucking chance here.  That.  To be third mic on the Opie and Anthony show.  He's probably.  Now, knowing him.  He does prepare a lifetime.  But Oscar only needs eight minutes. 
[01:06:30]  He gets a little nervous.  Tell him he better have a bunch of topics.  He's got a lot of stories.  I'll talk to him during the break.  Uh-oh.  Iraq's already laughing.  Okay, man.  What happened?  Mr. Rock, what's going on?  He's cutting up other audio, so he didn't hear what you just announced.  So we went and told him.  I said, you have eight minutes.  Really?  He's panicking.  He's the most nervous guy I've ever seen.  We want this show to be kind of current, so it better be some current shit he wants to 
[01:07:00]  talk about.  And, well.  Whatever's in the news, in pop culture, I don't care.  He will talk about a little update on his love life when we were trying to make a little  love connection between him and, what was the girl's name?  Kristen.  Kristen, who was in here.  Very cute girl.  And we have an update.  That's right.  To the search for a little relationship.  Wasn't there some numbers exchanged last Friday?  Yeah, yeah.  So did they go out?  We'll find out.  And there is an update.  Oh, there is?  Yeah, yeah.  That's an update.  Great.  All right.  We got some stuff to do today.  What the hell?  We'll stay here today, Sam. 
[01:07:30]  Yay!  We'll give them a full show.  Yeah.  What the hell?  It's going to be a great one.  We're at this.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Opie and Anthony.  Got E-Rock in studio.  Sam.  Sam.  Helping us out today. 
[01:08:00]  Where's Danny?  Got something to do?  I don't know.  Taking a day?  Taking a day.  I think some of the guys are still burning up those days.  Yeah, no kidding.  I burned a few this week.  Mmm.  And it was nice.  Yeah, it's always fun.  There's nothing in the news worth fucking mentioning today.  No?  Thank God we have Oscar to help us out.  I'm sure he'll have lots of entertaining, amazing stories. 
[01:08:30]  The Other Guys looks like it's going to be a good movie.  75% on Rotten Tomatoes.  Really?  I love Will Ferrell.  I really do.  The movie just looks a lot like Cop Out, which is confusing me a little bit.  He's hit or miss though, man.  God.  Sometimes he gets a little too wacky Will Ferrell-y.  He does get Will Ferrell-y.  Yeah, it's like, eh, all right.  It's a good way to put it.  Get it.  Don't try so hard.  Yeah.  You're a really funny guy. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  What are we saying?  It's Will Ferrell.  Yeah.  And then Mocky Mock.  Mocky Mock.  Mocky Mock.  We used to call our show.  What happened with that?  I know.  What happened to that relationship?  We didn't do anything wrong.  That guy's so fucking completely famous.  Huh?  He's so completely famous.  And we were talking about him.  He was on our show a year ago.  I know.  He was pretty fucking famous then as well.  That was another, if we do nine phoners with him, he'll come in studio.  Yeah, remember that, Jack?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's going to come in the same time Edward Norton comes in. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  No, guys.  If you do, yeah.  This phoner, he promises next time, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  A lot of blah, blah, blah going on in this place.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The Rock is in the other guys, too.  Is he?  Dwayne Johnson.  He used to do our fucking show.  That's true.  And we patch shit up with him.  And this one's not a family movie.  Accusations of racism.  Huh?  Until the accusations of racism.  And then...  We patched that shit up.  Oh, yeah.  We even talked about it on the air with him.  Yep. 
[01:10:00]  We were good with The Rock.  What happened?  Well, he was doing family movies up until now, so he probably wasn't promoting on our  show.  He's perfect for our show with the other guys.  Why don't we have one guy from this movie?  From the other guys.  This is the same exact demo we're both going after.  I know.  This fucking place sucks at getting us guests.  I don't think any of the people from the other guys are coming into any of the shows  here.  Well, that shouldn't be an excuse as to why they're not doing our show.  Right.  That's true.  Who cares about the rest of the shows?  Yeah, most of these shows aren't worth doing. 
[01:10:30]  We all know that.  Some are.  Like what?  Oh, the Sam Roberts fucking show?  Sam and Dave?  I just can't mention which are, because then I'll be saying which aren't, and that's not  very diplomatic, is it?  No, no, it's not.  No, no, not at all.  You're the consummate diplomat.  You always have been.  That will work well for you, though.  I should have done that over the years.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right, Ant, you want to bring in Oscar to do a little third mic?  It's what I dream of, is Oscar coming in and, oh, my God, he's running in here. 
[01:11:00]  All right, he's up on the chair.  Do you like sitting or standing, Oscar?  Oh, I prefer to sit.  Huh?  I want to sit.  Oh, you're not as nervous if you sit?  Yeah, yeah.  Excuse me, should I turn my phone off in case?  Well, nobody calls me, so I'm...  I'll just turn it down so there's no interruption. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, you don't want the phone going off.  Hell no.  That is a faux pas on the air.  See, we like to teach a little broadcasting here.  But can he lower his chair so I can get your big fat head on video?  My head?  Oh, yeah, I can take it.  Yeah, please.  There you go.  I got my HD flip.  Can you go lower?  A little more?  Is that a little...  Well, how do you get lower?  Oh, that's as low as the chair goes?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  We had like a little baby school or something.  You got it?  Might have to prop that up.  I like a little more headroom in my videos.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Pretty cool.  Yeah, yeah, good.  Awesome.  Oh.  Awesome.  Let me see.  Yeah.  That's perfect.  Actually, I'm quite comfy.  It's really comfy, actually.  Yeah.  I can do this all day.  His head is level with the console now.  That's perfect.  Awesome.  I got plenty of headroom in my video, too.  This is perfect.  Awesome.  Yeah, that's cool.  So we got Oscar in studio.  For the people that don't know, we discovered Oscar last Friday, even though he's been interning  here for a long fucking time.  Yeah.  And it came to our attention that Oscar is a bit on the nervous side. 
[01:12:30]  He gets a little nervous in situations with girls, we noticed, in situations where he's  on the air.  He gets very nervous.  And what else makes you nervous?  Like being out with people?  Are you okay?  Like in a crowd?  Like in a mall or something?  Yeah, yeah.  The one thing that scares you out of me is the height, man.  I can't be in a high place, man, because I just look down and, whoo, scary.  You know we're like 40 floors up here.  I know.  I know.  That's why I think I should try to pretend we're on the ground floor. 
[01:13:00]  You pretend.  Yeah.  Or think that I'm somewhere safe.  Have you ever walked near the windows?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a nice view.  So it just, you know, I mean, I know there's a glass in between, so I know there's no chances  of me just like, oh, kind of tipping over.  Out on a ledge out there, you'd be freaking out like anybody would.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, man.  And don't you understand, everyone's cool with the windows in, but if there's no fucking  windows on a wall, anybody wouldn't like heights. 
[01:13:30]  That's right, yeah.  I agree.  He agreed.  He agreed.  He concurred.  Well, that's not how third mic works.  You're supposed to kind of tag what Ant said and add to it, and then the discussion builds,  and then we include the callers so they can fuck up the whole discussion.  You've heard the program.  Absolutely, yes, yes, yes.  And you've heard Jimmy Norton.  Yes, yes, yes.  On the third mic, and he's a genius.  And believe me, I don't expect you to be at a level of a Jimmy Norton, but I do have 
[01:14:00]  some expectations from you.  Okay.  And that's, since you know the show, to listen and add in your own opinions and observations  of whatever we're discussing.  Okay.  You know how to do that, right?  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely, yeah.  But, I mean, Jimmy Norton's, I'm really big shoes to fill.  Is that, no?  I'm a really big shoes to fill?  Yeah, no, no, I didn't say that.  I said, what I meant to say, like, you ever heard that saying that, like, walk a mile in  my shoes?  Yeah, so it'll be hard to walk a mile in his shoes, though, no? 
[01:14:30]  I mean, actually, I don't know why I was going with that, but AIDS?  What's up with AIDS?  What's up with AIDS?  I wish you'd get it.  Okay.  Oh, no, that's not nice.  No.  That's, uh...  Oh, good.  Good retort.  But isn't there, like, a cocktail that you're supposed to, like, drink it and, like, you're  all good now?  Like, it was, like, a cure or some sort of...  Well, not quite a cure.  Is that what you're telling yourself?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, but I hope they don't come up with the cure, because people are going to be 
[01:15:00]  like, ah, if I get it, I can just get the cocktail.  Why wouldn't that be good?  It's almost like the clap.  No, because the people are just going to be not...  They kind of take that, uh, what do you call it, uh, what's that word I'm looking for?  Wait, wait, I got it.  Uh, uh, uh, take for granted.  That's it.  You know?  They would take it for granted what?  Oh, it, uh, the...  I love how he was looking for a word and then came up with a sentence.  Yeah, yeah, what's that word?  Take it for granted.  Yeah.  That's right. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  So, nice, nice.  It's hot outside, like, really hot.  I just stepped out real quick.  How hot is it?  Yeah, it was, like, freaking, like, Cuban as hell.  Yeah.  I swear, yeah.  What?  Yeah.  It was really humid outside.  Oh, I thought he said it's Cuban as hell.  Oh, Cuban.  It did sound like Cuban.  Which is kind of funny.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I had Cuban food yesterday.  It was really freaking good.  Yeah?  It was like a pork burrito.  It had, like, beans and rice.  It was delish.  It was really good.  Yesterday for lunch.  You're like a subject explosion. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Like, there's subjects in a warehouse all on the shelves, and the place blows up.  Uh-huh.  That's exactly what's coming out of you.  Yeah.  Why would you tell us you had Cuban food yesterday?  Oh, you said the thing, and I stumbled on the word, and it sounded like Cuban or humid,  and then it just...  Yeah, humid sounded like Cuban.  That's like a trigger.  It kind of triggered my mind.  Oh, make a joke.  Yeah, Mark Cuban might be buying...  Yeah.  What?  Mark Cuban might be buying, what, the Texas Rangers or some shit?  Oh.  I thought he was buying something that we keep getting involved with. 
[01:16:30]  No, buying a baseball team.  Oh, I love...  I fucking love that guy.  Yeah.  Mark Cuban rules.  He's fucked up.  He used to do our show, too.  What happened to him?  He used to sit right where you're sitting, Oscar.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, what happened to him?  You guys heard that one joke about Helen Keller?  No?  What?  No.  My boss told me this the other day, and it was why her dog died, and it was...  It was because you commit suicide if your name was...  No?  Never heard that one?  No? 
[01:17:00]  Well, Sam told me to tell a joke, and that's the only thing that came up to mind.  So, anyways...  I didn't do anything of this sort.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  I guess it's only the reaction.  Like, ugh.  Like that?  No?  Yeah, maybe it's a little visual.  It's always good to explain.  You shook your hands.  It's always good to explain a joke after it bombs.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  He is a thousand miles an hour, man.  Right into a wall every time, too.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  That's right.  Yeah.  So, are you going to be okay with just sitting there and kind of just being part of the show?  Absolutely, yeah.  I think so.  I hope I can manage.  I mean, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I think he'll do just fine.  Oh, you know what?  We should get to know Oscar.  Last Friday, we had him talking to girls.  Right.  Could he talk to that one girl that keeps walking by here?  Look at Mars.  Mars.  Huh?  Right, Mars?  Huh?  Married, but not dead, right?  Mars!  Mars!  I don't see no ring on that finger, Mars.  What happened?  I'm a...  I'm a...  What's the matter?  Why don't you wear a wedding ring, man? 
[01:18:00]  I work with electronics.  So...  That's what you tell your wife?  No, it's smart.  Safety.  Who's electronic?  What?  I thought it was a code name for some broad...  You're not supposed to wear it.  Where did you lose the ring?  No, I didn't lose it.  I just don't wear it.  Where is it?  I actually don't have one.  Oh, shit.  Oh, snap.  It's because it's Puerto Rican, Oscar.  Oh, snap.  What's up?  Oh, snap.  Why don't you have a wedding ring?  Because, like I said, I don't wear it. 
[01:18:30]  I don't like wedding rings.  So, um...  But I think you'd have one.  No, I was just going to say Mars, uh...  Remember how you couldn't pronounce words?  Yeah.  What's that chicken sandwich place?  The place, the fast food place that you went to.  He looks like he's going to fucking kick you in the face.  I can't remember what the place was.  Go ahead, Mars.  No, don't answer it for him.  Oh, no, I was going to say there's a cow involved, right?  That's right.  Very good, Oscar. 
[01:19:00]  I've seen the little ads.  Oh, no, the little things hanging around somewhere.  What's it called, Mars?  I don't remember.  Chick-a-fail?  What the fuck is he calling me?  Chick-a-fail.  Chick-a-fail.  Oh, wow.  No, no, what is it?  You were just about to say it right.  You got it this time.  Fill-a-chick.  Fill-a-chick.  Fill-a-chick. 
[01:19:30]  I like that.  That's always...  Fill-a-chick.  Fill-a-chick.  That's nice.  Absolutely.  All right, Oscar.  So, last week we had you talking to girls and you exchanged numbers with somebody.  That's right, yeah.  What was your name again?  Kristen.  Kristen works here on another channel, I believe.  Hits one intern.  Oh, Hits one intern.  Oh.  So, what happened after the show?  We needed an update.  Oh, yeah.  It was going well in studio and we saw you walking down the hall with your arm around her.  Yeah, yeah.  Awkwardly.  Yeah, no, and it's crazy, though, because my legs are really long and hers were really short. 
[01:20:00]  So, I was just trying to keep up, trying to pace it out.  It was just awkward.  Like, trying to dance.  It's like, in a way, I don't know, that's what I compare it to.  Anyways, what happened was that, oh, yeah, I just went there and then I think she said  something to the effect that she was like, oh, we could probably just let go now because,  you know, they're not watching, of course.  Oh, like as soon as possible.  Exactly, yeah.  She didn't want to have any physical contact as soon as possible.  Yeah, absolutely, yeah.  So, now you had her phone number, right? 
[01:20:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I'm feeling like, though, Will?  Yeah, go ahead.  This is a little too much like...  I just set up an Oscar cam.  Nice.  It rules.  Oh, wow.  That is good.  It's just a fucking fat Mexican head.  Oh, Colombia, by the way.  Oh, sorry.  That's all right.  No problem.  Same thing.  Everybody makes that.  Same thing.  Sorry about that.  You know what I'm feeling, though?  Yes.  I'm not feeling him as third Mike here.  I'm feeling him like the intern came in and we're interviewing him.  True.  Well, it's the get to know thing, you know?  Yeah, but you know what?  You got to do this like, you know, when Patrice is in or Bobby Kelly, 
[01:21:00]  they just tell the story.  It's not like we have to interview them.  They know to tell the story.  So, just tell the story.  We all know you met this girl here on the show.  You exchanged numbers, and then, so, what happened after that?  Oh, after that, you know.  Now, just tell the story.  Yeah, so, after the show, I saw her.  She was there on the computer, and then I passed by, and I said, hi. 
[01:21:30]  And then I went to the kitchen, and I get back.  Actually, this is going boring.  All right, let's get to the spicy part.  I was on the way out, and I saw, I think one of the co-workers or something.  I was, oh, it was Christina around, and I messed that up.  Oh, no, I mean Kristen, Kristen.  Oh, she's doing, like, conducting interviews.  Oh, okay.  So, then, on the way out, on the way out, I was, I saw her.  It was across the glass over there, and I just kind of did the scan card,  and it was way by her, and then she was, yeah, got busy, and something interrupted. 
[01:22:00]  So, yeah, that didn't go anywhere.  And, and, yes, go, yeah.  Anyways, we wasn't going with that.  Anyway, so, now we skip up to Saturday, Saturday.  So, then, sure enough, actually, I was going to call her in the afternoon Friday,  but I was like, nah, maybe it's just a little too much.  And then Saturday, Saturday, I worked all day.  So, at 5 o'clock, I left work, and I was like, hey, let me just give her a call and stuff  after I had a steak and salad.  And, and then, and then, so I sat down by my bed, and I call her up. 
[01:22:30]  What's up?  Yes?  Is it down?  Slow down?  Okay.  Hey, Travis.  How you doing?  Anyways, so, oh, so I called up, so it rings, like, five times.  It rings five times, and then I was just like, ah, maybe I'll just leave, like, a voicemail  or something, and then she picked up, and then it was like, hello?  And I was like, oh, hey, Kristen, how you doing?  It's Oscar.  And she goes, hello.  And, oh, hi, Kristen, how you doing?  It's Oscar.  How's it going?  And it goes silent.  Silent completely. 
[01:23:00]  And I'm like, so I was like, hey, maybe let me wait for a, like, a ring toner, like,  a little beep, you know, like, leave your message after a phone or something after the,  leave your message after the beep.  Sorry.  Anyways, and beep, that's it.  Beep.  And then, and it was just nothing.  There was nothing, so I bailed out, and then I just kind of lay in bed looking up, and I  was like, man, should I, I started thinking, like, a million miles, man, oh, should I call  her back, or should I text her, or what about, and I started overthinking, so it was  overwhelming, and I just ended up taking a nap for an hour, and that was it. 
[01:23:30]  Anyways.  No, but I was so tired Saturday, I was like, oh, man, that would mean I have to have into  the city, and then, and then, and then the train, and, and then what, and nothing happened.  That's it.  So, Saturday night, what did I do Saturday?  Oh, I went to Walmart after that, and went and bought, bought a Blu-ray DVD player, when,  I had to go back twice, because I had these, uh, there's, uh, the European Top Gear  DVDs, uh, and then they're on Blu-ray, but they didn't play on my, my PS3.  So, then I returned to PS3, and he's got a regular DVD player, I mean, Blu-ray DVDs. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, I watched Top Gear, a DVD player, yeah, that's, uh, anyways, wait, um, wait, how's  it going with this?  Wait, one second.  Wait, let me just restructure my thought right here.  Um, wait.  Okay.  Did you restructure it with a fucking shotgun?  Yeah, so, yeah, I just shot myself on the foot right now.  Wow.  Anyways.  I'm exhausted.  I am exhausted.  I don't even know what he just said.  No?  So, she blew you off, I guess.  I guess.  No, well.  She made believe she couldn't hear you.  Yeah, that sounds like she made believe she couldn't hear you, and was like, hello, 
[01:24:30]  hello.  Did, you said right away, hey, this is Oscar?  Uh, yeah.  And then, and then she went, hello.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, and then you just heard a click.  It could have been the wrong phone number.  For a long time.  It, it was, it was the right phone number.  It was the right, okay.  Wait, so what's it gonna say?  Uh, wait.  Anyways.  Wait, wait, hold up, I got it.  I got it.  Excuse me one second.  Oh, no.  Wait, wait, hold up.  I was gonna say something, and I'm, uh, I can't think.  What's up?  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:25:00]  Wait, I almost got it.  I almost got it.  Um.  Oh, I just, I was, I didn't really have intention of calling her.  To be honest with you, I just did it to fulfill my, uh, assignment, I guess.  Assignment.  Your, your what?  The assignment is pretty much like, I say.  No, to fulfill your what?  Assignment.  Oh, okay.  Assignment.  Assignment.  Assignment.  Assignment.  My assignment.  Pete Johnson.  Sound like Pete Johnson.  Yes.  I, I guess it's my mouth.  A chindled dog.  A licking licking.  I had a black and mild on the way here this morning. 
[01:25:30]  What?  A black and mild little cigars.  Sorry, maybe that's why my mouth's like all dried up and shit from a little cigar.  I think a little nervous, too.  Oh, that too.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Yeah.  So, Oscar, we, uh, we want to talk about some shit going on in the world.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we want you to lead us a little bit.  What do you, what do you got in front of you?  Uh.  You had eight minutes to prepare for the big, uh.  I know.  Yeah.  A lot of times, Jimmy brings subjects to the table.  It was more like six minutes, actually, because I had to go to the bathroom and pee real quick.  So, um.  That was two minutes, huh?  Yeah.  Okay.  I guess. 
[01:26:00]  Well, and then I was talking to Sam in the bathroom, too.  It's so weird to, like, make a conversation in the bathroom, though, because you're peeing  and you're like, you have your stuff in your hands.  I mean, your junk.  And then, and you say, hey, how's it going?  Oh, right.  It's an awkward trying to make, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We talk about that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, it's weird.  Actually, I'll, actually coming up, because I, earlier I stepped out real quick to get coffee.  Yeah.  And then, uh, I was, V-Boy was in the elevator.  Coffee.  Yeah, I know.  Ha, ha.  What is it? 
[01:26:30]  Uh, coffee.  Or, a little louder.  Coffee.  You don't really do that, right?  He doesn't really do that, right?  Wait, that's how you say it?  Uh, I, I don't know.  I like that.  Like, it has that little, like, ring twit.  Jackie Martling laughed at race.  What's up with the cat?  There's, like, a cat.  I don't know.  I'm just trying to trigger something.  I don't like cats, man.  You guys like cats?  No?  You guys? 
[01:27:00]  I'm not a fan of cats, man.  Just because they're, like, kind of useless.  You're doing stand-up?  No, no.  Am I?  No, I'm not.  Can I have some water?  He's fucking losing it.  Well, it takes a little water.  Can we have Mars try to pronounce where he likes eating?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, Mars.  You want to give that another try, Mars?  The chicken sandwich place.  Yeah.  I just don't know the name of it.  They make a great sandwich.  Yeah.  They really do.  Fill the chicken.  It's closed on Sundays because of the religious thing.  No, no.  No? 
[01:27:30]  Chick-a-fill-chick-f...  I don't know.  I don't know.  KFC?  No.  Good one, Oscar.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That's right, yeah.  That would be funny if he couldn't pronounce that.  That's right.  All right, so go ahead, Oscar.  Lead us.  All right.  What's going on in the world?  I guess I just went into Yahoo, and then I saw Michelle Obama.  She went on a vacation with, like, the daughter, and we went to Spain and then missed the husband's Barack's birthday.  That's pretty messed up, though. 
[01:28:00]  Because, you know, it's like the wife, and then...  What?  Careful.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So I don't know what to...  I don't know.  I just saw...  I didn't have time to read the whole article.  But, no, I was messed up, too, because check it out.  Back in...  I had this friend, right?  The whole...  And then what happened for her birthday, that kind of triggered that thing.  Anyway, so for her birthday, I went and I bought a cake.  I bought, like, champagne, flowers.  You like this girl?  Oh, my God.  I would, like, die.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, if she doesn't talk to me anymore.  But anyways, though...  Why doesn't she talk to me?  Why?  I don't know. 
[01:28:30]  Excuse me.  What's up?  Wait, why doesn't she talk to you?  What's the cake?  Oh, strawberry cake with vanilla.  No, I don't know.  It's just...  It's so weird.  It's...  Does he talk to himself?  Well, no, Sam was asking, so...  I didn't say a thing.  Oh, I know, but you wrote it.  I don't even have a pen.  Okay, cool.  Anyways, so, um...  Where was I going?  Anyway, so we go back to Michelle, or just the story I was telling?  What happened to the girl?  No, not...  Well, sorry, I showed up.  We hung out for a couple hours, and then, um...  I...  We...  Oh, the cake was smashed, because I had it in a backpack. 
[01:29:00]  And I got there, and it was kind of, like, a total, like, epic fail, because, like,  it was, like, oh, it's a guy, I got you a cake, and it was, like, half smashed.  Yeah, but then we ate it, though.  And then, um...  What was it?  You ate...  Did the girl eat it, too?  Yeah, we all ate it, because it was, like, her roommates and stuff.  Yeah, it was a fun time.  It was something nice for her birthday, and I gave her, like, a card, and, like, I bought,  like, a Chinatown, like, a $10 bracelet.  Right, right.  Aw, this is so sad.  Look at this.  Like, the government shuts down a girl's lemonade stand.  She's seven years old.  Look at her. 
[01:29:30]  The poor kid.  What?  The government stepped in and shut down her lemonade stand because of, like, a health  code thing.  Enough.  That the stand violates the law.  Look at her.  You know what?  People just stay away from...  Aw, the poor kid.  What do you think of that?  No, I stay away from lemonade stands because it's just awkward, like, for a guy like me  and go up to talk to, like, seven-year-olds.  I stay away from that, man.  That scares the shit out of me.  Yeah, I never know.  I'm always careful with that.  Oh, oh, I just thought of something.  Check it out.  So what happened, like, at work, I have to deliver, usually, like, suitcases and stuff 
[01:30:00]  like that, because that's retail, like, suitcases.  So what happened, we were delivering to this private school.  So what happened, I guess they have now codes in place for security purposes.  So if you drive in there and then any of the faculty to see somebody that's suspicious,  they could go up to them and they kind of, like...  Somebody that's what?  Huh?  Faculty?  No?  No, somebody that's what?  Oh, that's suspicious.  Oh, okay.  Exactly.  On the school grounds.  So they immediately go up to you and they, what are you doing here?  What's your name? 
[01:30:30]  What are you doing?  So that happened to me yesterday, because it's the one guy.  I rolled down my window.  He was like, can I help you?  And I was like, oh, I'm just having a delivery for Kevin.  And he just walked off and was like, yeah, thanks for the help, asshole.  So anyway, so he, yeah, and then I delivered the things and then just went back to work.  Anyways.  End of story.  Yeah, that's it.  Wait, what was I going to say?  So yeah, going back to the lemonade stand, that's sad, though.  I mean, the girl's trying to, you know, entrepreneurialize her, I guess, herself.  And yeah, it's just that.  Yeah.  Oh, so she's pretty cute.  Actually, it looks like I have a six-year-old sister. 
[01:31:00]  He's turning six tomorrow, so he looks kind of like her.  She's cute.  Yeah.  So birthday tomorrow, going to have a huge party.  Yeah, family and friends and stuff.  So I'm looking forward to that.  Actually, yeah.  Actually, I have a busy weekend.  Yeah, what else is going on?  Oh, yeah.  Somebody came into work yesterday, and it was from Morristown Partnership, where, you know,  where the town I live.  And he was like, are you Oscar?  And I was like, yeah.  And then he said, yeah, well, there's a film festival.  And then deadline Saturday, if you want to submit one of your films.  And I said, oh, okay.  But then I have to, like, restructure it, though, because, like, I have it at 12 minutes, 
[01:31:30]  so I have to cut it down to five.  So I'm going to be working on that tonight.  I'm really excited.  Can I ask you something?  Sure, sure, sure.  Do you think that these stories that you're telling are entertaining?  No.  I just do it and fill up the dead air.  See, see, that's the thing.  There's filling up dead air, just talking.  Okay.  And then there's conveying a story in a humorous way.  It doesn't have to be a joke or interesting way.  It has a beginning, a middle, an end, a dynamic to telling the story. 
[01:32:00]  You know, you've heard the show, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  Just kind of like that.  Not just blurting out random thoughts.  But he's on to something.  He feels like if no one else is talking, he has to fill up.  Yeah, yeah.  Why do you feel like you have to fill up the dead air?  Oh, because it will just be awkward.  It'll just be like sitting around, like looking around, like, what's up?  You know, like that.  Yeah.  What was I going to say?  Wait, I was going to go. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, man.  I had a thought a second ago.  It's probably not important.  No, no.  Don't get me wrong.  Okay.  I'm not saying that, you know, whatever you're saying isn't important or anything.  It's just, you know, just tell a story.  Maybe it has something to do with it because I'm lefty.  So I think backwards.  Yeah, because I don't have the structure of, like, middle, beginning, and end.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Beginning, middle, and end.  That's it.  Just kind of, like, anyways.  All right, moving along.  All right. 
[01:33:00]  I don't watch American Idol, so I'm not going to talk about that.  Because Sam just kind of threw it out there.  You know, when we were out there, he was like, hey, we can talk about it.  He was trying to help you out.  But, I mean, you tell us what you want to talk about.  Yeah, yeah.  You just riff.  You know what?  The Arizona immigration, I mean, that's kind of a hot topic right now.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, maybe you can talk a little about that.  Yeah, so it's.  Yeah, you.  Well, what's your thoughts on it?  Well, it's difficult because, I mean, there's just a lot of issues involved.  And the thing is that, for example, I mean, there's a lot of, like, good people, just like they're bad. 
[01:33:30]  But then the bad make the good seem, like, bad as well.  So, oh, hey.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, what?  How you doing?  Nice.  Wait, so I was going with this?  So, what happened?  You're talking about the immigration.  Immigration.  Yeah, immigration.  Yeah, yeah.  So, like I said, man.  Now, of course, you being of Latin descent.  Mexican.  Yeah, Colombian.  Colombian, Mexican, whatever. 
[01:34:00]  You probably, what are your feelings about this Arizona thing?  You would be down there and you would probably be targeted.  You'd be carded.  Absolutely.  They would look for your papers.  Would that upset you now, thinking that, well, for the good of the country, it's probably good that they get the illegals out.  But how would you feel being the person that would be being questioned and asked for, you know, your ID and stuff?  Well, it's hard.  I mean, because first of all, I mean, to become, like, getting, like, a green card in the state that's really difficult, it's a long process, it's really expensive.  And then you have to have the right lawyer and everything like that. 
[01:34:30]  And there are a lot of people that are willing to work and do everything accordingly and follow the rules and everything.  And then, like, me, personally, I would say make it mandatory.  All right, check it out.  All right, so you're going to make definitely English the standard.  Definitely, because, I mean, there's still, I know it's still.  But, you know, because you don't have to let go of your.  When are you going to work on that?  What's up?  Oscar, why are you still talking when Robert Kelly's in the studio?  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're taking up his air time.  I'm sorry.  No, buddy, go ahead, man. 
[01:35:00]  I'm enjoying listening to fucking life in real time.  Fucking.  This is Oscar.  Yeah, I've been listening.  Bob Kelly.  Fantastic.  He's a very nervous kid.  He's extremely nervous.  It's disappointing.  And it has nothing to do with being on the radio, by the way.  He'll be just like this outside the studio, just talking to two people.  He's out of his mind nervous.  Thanksgiving table.  He's out of his fucking mind, this kid.  We don't know why.  I'm kind of disappointed that I was listening on the radio and, you know, when you visualize 
[01:35:30]  somebody, I just pictured long curly hair, a fucking army jacket.  Yeah, like, like the FARC or something.  You know what I mean?  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  He's tiring.  He's one of those guys.  He'll tire you out.  You should just rent him out to a party.  Right.  He call him the bachelor party ruiner.  Yeah, I haven't been invited to, like, a freaking wedding in a while.  So, yeah, I should start looking up and see who's getting married, you know.  What do you mean looking up? 
[01:36:00]  You don't have to look up who's getting married.  Usually it comes in the mail.  They send you an invitation.  That's right.  Oh, that's right.  And then how old are you?  I'm 26 now.  So you're at that age where you should be going to weddings every weekend.  And you're not going to weddings?  Yeah.  No, no, not like that.  Actually, last year I went to a baby shower.  And they never invited me back after that.  Why?  No, because what happened?  Maybe because they weren't having another baby.  You're only invited to a baby shower once when they're having a baby.  Right.  If Cheech and Chong fucked and had a baby, it would be this fucking way. 
[01:36:30]  A lot of people saying, yeah, Chong.  A little Chong in his voice.  And he laughs like Barney Rubble.  That comes in a lot.  Yeah, what?  I don't have nothing.  Why did they invite you back to the baby shower?  No, what happened?  I got drunk, right?  And then they asked me, hey, Oscar, can you go move this?  It was like a three-piece.  It was a three-piece like a baby cradle.  And then it had like a stroller.  And it also had like a, I don't know, some sort of shower device.  And then so it was a big box.  And then I was drunk too.  So I picked it up and I was going into the living room. 
[01:37:00]  All of a sudden, it was, I lost grip.  The freaking thing just went over and hits the freaking huge, like, those TV hits it.  No way.  And I was in the middle.  And I was just that asshole that just like ruining the party.  And I was like, oh, shit.  And I kind of just like, you know, faded into the crowd and like, ha, ha, ha.  Just like that.  Anyways.  What's up, man?  What's up, brother?  How you doing?  All right, man.  Doing fantastic on Third Mike.  Are you nervous that Bob Kelly's in here?  Yeah.  Very funny guy.  Yeah, absolutely.  And a great actor, by the way. 
[01:37:30]  Nice, nice.  I saw you on Louie.  Jesus Christ, Bobby.  Thank you, buddy.  Fuck the comedy.  You're going to be doing some acting.  Hopefully.  I'm serious.  Yes, hopefully.  You want to get out of that fucking business?  How do you cry on cue like that?  Do you watch Louie?  Have you heard his past?  True.  Well, that's why I want to ask.  I wonder.  He conjures up one thought and he's in tears.  I just saw a little spiff in suspenders alone at a park.  If you're not watching, first of all.  I thought about that little midget girl getting engaged.  First of all, if you're not watching Louie on FX, you're stupid. 
[01:38:00]  It's a great show.  Most people loving it.  The fucking critics loving it, too.  Yeah.  Bobby plays Louie's brother on the show, and this past episode, you had to cry.  Yeah.  What were you thinking to get the tears flowing?  Well, you know what happened?  Louie called me three weeks before and just literally said, can you cry?  I was like, yeah.  I just said, of course I'm going to say, yeah.  He's like, no.  Can you cry on film?  Made it this fucked up thing.  I was like, yes, I can do it.  Have you heard anything in my act?  Like anything I've ever said? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, I can cry.  I can think of just my life at any point of the day and fucking cry.  My mortgage and how I'm trying to pay it every week, every month, and this fucking guy then leaves.  And then I'm thinking about fucking crying, and then he calls me back a week before.  He goes, don't worry about crying.  I shouldn't have done that to you.  I'm like, yeah, well, fuck you.  I'm thinking about crying the whole time.  Like, what the fuck?  How am I going to get there?  Hot sauce.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  No.  Are you done?  Go ahead.  No, no.  Is that how you cry? 
[01:39:00]  What do you mean hot sauce?  You can jump in.  You're third.  Mike, you don't have to say sorry for jumping in, dude.  That's how the show works.  Okay, okay.  Hot sauce usually does a trick.  I mean, if you think about it.  I mean, oh, it does with me.  I don't know.  Poor you.  We have hot sauce?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You want to try it?  Oh, I had one time.  Check it out.  It was funny.  Why don't we recreate the scene?  Yeah.  You want to try the hot sauce thing?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I guess.  You don't have to pour it in your eye, because that would be dangerous.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  You get a little on your fingers, then just rub it in the corner.  No, I'll just do the mouth, because with the mouth, it's fine enough. 
[01:39:30]  I mean, I'll do it.  And you'll cry?  Yeah.  I got to see Oscar crying.  Really?  If you put it in your mouth, you'll cry?  Yeah, yeah.  I just get a little teary.  Yeah.  Anyways.  No, so check it out.  There's one time.  Well, it was...  Bobby was in the middle of a fucking story about his acting.  Oh, shit, right.  Sam, help me out here.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  Oh, it's Chipotle, too.  Anyways.  Is that really hot?  Do you have a spoon or something?  Yeah, look at the color of it.  Yeah, that is.  It looks like red wine.  That is really...  That just looks fucking hot.  That's the one that the Mexicans keep in the back. 
[01:40:00]  Don't leave on the table.  Just wing that into a border patrolman's eyes when they're close to the fucking border.  They have it in a square gun.  Super Soka full of that shit.  All right.  So, could Bobby finish his story?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, I'm sorry.  And then you could show us how easily you cry?  Interrupt.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Repeat that again?  Go ahead, Bobby.  He, I don't even know where I was.  Oh, Louie fucking, you know the old lady that plays the mom, right? 
[01:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  Do you even watch it, Anthony?  No.  Thank you.  Let's just get that out of the way.  Sorry.  Louie's mom on the show is some big-time actress, right?  Anthony's the best.  Emmy Award-winning actress?  Emmy Award.  Tony Award, actually.  She came across like a real squat.  She was a nice lady.  She was nice.  But, I mean, her role on the show.  Oh, my God.  She was fantastic.  She was very squatty.  But she fucking, like, I was like, oh, my God, I got to learn all my fucking lines because 
[01:41:00]  I'm working with a Tony Award-winning actress.  I don't want to fuck up and be that guy.  Yeah.  You know, especially with Louie.  And Louie's, you know, the fucking, he does everything.  He's a director.  He's everything there.  So, and he's really good with, you know, actors.  But we start the scene.  He literally shoots it from front to end, like a play.  He just shoots it 900 times.  And then once you get it, he's like, let's just fuck it.  Let's go.  And so you're going from front to back.  That's a big, long scene. 
[01:41:30]  And I know all my fucking lines.  I'm ready to go, man.  I'm ready to fucking, I've been working my ass off on this.  We get there.  And you got to go, you got to build it.  To cry, you have to literally do the scene from front to back to get to the point where  she's such a cunt to me that I'm, like, fucking welling up, thinking of all the fucking  mother issues when my mother wouldn't help me with my math, told me to do it herself.  That's why she didn't fucking do math.  And when she fucking was with the guy that used to beat me and didn't leave him and said,  can you just deal with it?  And all this shit, all this stuff I'm trying to think of, right? 
[01:42:00]  And she fucking, she didn't know one line.  No, well, we started two seconds and she's like, ah, ah, ah, what's the line?  And you're, you're like waiting for the moment.  I'm fucking dying.  I'm fucking dying.  And then, but once I got it out, fucking once I got it out, once you cry.  I, one time, the tears, I, I was fucking a blubbering asshole.  Really?  Yeah, for the rest.  I was just, ah, ah, boogers.  And I was off to the side and all the girl extras were just looking at me like, ah, good 
[01:42:30]  job.  I was wiping tears and a little snort out of my nose.  Wow.  Yeah.  I was supposed to be at the end by myself and, ah, be there crying by myself, but they  cut it.  They edited that part out.  Oh.  Dude, you did a great job, though.  Yeah, it was good, man.  It was good.  And I'm hearing you're getting more acting gigs, right?  I did the, uh.  Can you talk about the one thing you were telling me after the last time you were on  the show?  I did the curb, yeah.  Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Bob fucking Kelly.  Yeah, a little small part, but it was a good one.  Got a small part with Larry David. 
[01:43:00]  You're doing lines back and forth with Larry?  Yeah.  Well, I actually did a, I can't really talk about it because they literally told me you  can't fucking say anything, but I said something to them and they came up, they  go, don't say that.  Really?  Yeah.  I kind of fucked up.  Wow.  The show ruins relationships.  I'll sort it that way.  I didn't know.  No, no.  Just the way we treat each other.  Yeah.  Just fuck.  Sometimes that comes out.  Oh, because you're improv-ing, so you figure it's okay to say almost anything, right?  Not everybody fucking treats, you can't fucking treat everybody the way we treat each other 
[01:43:30]  on this shit.  Yeah, you can't just really acknowledge honesty.  Like, dude, look at your hair.  Fucking, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, you really can't say fucking shit like that.  What was that?  So, what was your hair reference?  I'm sorry, repeat that again.  I missed that.  I totally missed that.  Oh, I said, um, you really can't.  Are you making fun of the fact he has no hair?  No, I don't know.  I was just, uh, oh, no, no.  Damn.  I don't mean to start.  You were, right?  Oh, man.  Oh, no, no.  Snap.  What the fuck are you saying, man?  What's the problem with Bob Kelly's hair?  No, no.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Why would you mention hair knowing that he doesn't have any of this? 
[01:44:00]  What are you looking at Sam for?  Look at me.  Don't look at him.  Sam's not going to help you out.  No, I'm not looking at him.  Are you going to do this or not?  Oh, what?  Are you going to have this little twink help you?  Now, explain yourself.  What are you saying about my hair?  Oh, I, because I missed the story at the beginning.  I mean, listen.  I, just, my mind's like always one.  Don't look at that fucking.  You be a man and look at me right now.  You don't look over there.  No, no.  What were you saying about my hair?  Are you saying I'm bald?  Is that what you're fucking saying?  Are you?  Are you saying I'm fucking bald?  You just said, are you?  What do you think?  Look.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, I agree.  Is he bald or not?  Yes.  Are you? 
[01:44:30]  Do I have a headphone style hairdo?  No, no.  Actually, I was going to say, you remind me like a relative I used to, I haven't seen  in years.  Yeah?  Do your relative touch you?  No, no, no.  There's none of that shit in my face.  Thank God.  Colombians don't get molested?  No, no, I don't.  Are you saying you're better than Americans?  Oh, no, I didn't say that.  Because we molest each other?  Oh, no.  Don't take it that way, please.  That's a nice watch, by the way.  Thanks.  You want it?  No, no.  What, are you going to jump him after the show for? 
[01:45:00]  No, no, no.  I'm going to jump.  I bought a Rolex for $10 in China.  A what?  A Rolex?  Yeah.  No, he said it right.  Yeah, a Rolex.  A Rolex.  Yeah, a Rolex.  You just got ripped off.  I mean, yeah, I just bought a fake.  Anyway.  You didn't get ripped off if it cost you $10.  Yeah.  Oh.  You got ripped off if it's a couple thousand and it was $10.  For a Rolex.  A Rolex.  Holy shit.  That's good.  You ever been in Chinatown and just drink outside?  I don't drink, dude.  I've been sober for 25 years.  Oh, way to bring that up. 
[01:45:30]  Jesus Christ, man.  That's a very touching subject.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck, man.  Wow.  Don't bring up drinking.  I thought you listened to the show.  Yeah.  Oh, no, but not when he's been on.  I mean, because I'm running shut around.  That's the day you turn it off.  Now you don't fucking listen to me.  No, I listen to me.  What?  Because I'm on, you know, what?  Because I'm a recovering alcoholic, you know?  No, no, there's nothing.  And I'm bald.  You don't listen to the show then?  What are you, fucking racist?  No, no, I'm not racist.  I was molested.  That fucks you up?  I'm a bald drunkard.  Anyways, what can I say?  No, but 20 years.  That's pretty.  25, motherfucker.  25.  No, you said 20.  You throw five years out the fucking window? 
[01:46:00]  Laying that down?  That's a huge accomplishment.  Man, my nose is itching.  Anyways.  I was going to say, wait, so, yeah, because I did, like, the sober thing for, like, two  months, you know?  It was, like, hard.  Anyway.  Yeah, are you trying to relate to Bobby's 25 years?  With two months?  With two lousy months?  You probably had the flu.  You're saying it's hard.  What the fuck?  I'll stop drinking.  I fucked more guys with fucking more sobriety than you.  Where is that from?  Nothing.  You're trying to say that was from a movie, Bobby? 
[01:46:30]  No, because sometimes you guys do references, and I tried to, you know.  Yeah, I fucked more guys with more sobriety than you.  That wasn't supposed to slip out of your mouth, was it?  Hopefully it's an old movie line, right, Bobby?  Jesus.  Hey, Oscar said he could cry on the spot.  I say we got the Tabasco.  Yeah, let's give it a whirl.  Yeah, show us how you cry.  Too bad you don't have a scene, though.  I could do a scene with him.  I want to just see fucking Oscar cry on cue.  So what does it take, Oscar?  Walk us through you crying. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Every time I have a hot sauce, it just gives me a little teary.  That or wasabi.  Oh, wasabi and sushi.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Sushi.  This guacamole.  Yeah.  One time I had this Megadeth sauce.  It's like 500 times more potent than the jalapeno.  Wow.  And then I put it on a spicy tortilla chip, right?  So I ate it.  And then for like an hour and a half, I was like, ooh, like that for a whole hour and a half.  And I was putting beer, water.  What were you calling Helen Keller's dog?  It's a call back to you, Joe.  Oh, you know what?  Hold on. 
[01:47:30]  Hold on.  Bobby's a stand-up comic.  Why don't you try that joke on Bobby?  All right.  Try it again.  Do you know why Helen Keller's dog died?  No, I don't.  You will commit suicide if your name was...  Can you give crickets?  No?  No.  No?  Okay.  All right.  Let's do the Oscar crying thing.  So this is all it takes.  A little Tabasco and you'll cry.  Wow, a little.  That is an entire...  What are you making?  Salsa?  Salsa.  Salsa. 
[01:48:00]  Oscar, walk us through this.  All right.  So now I'm going to insert the spoon.  I'm going to insert the spoon in my mouth.  Yeah.  There you go.  And this will make you cry?  Don't smell it.  Just taste it.  Don't hold back.  If you start crying, you cry.  Oh, yeah.  No?  Nothing?  Nothing yet?  It's actually pretty good.  Wow. 
[01:48:30]  No.  Yeah, I just get a little in the eyes and nothing.  No, I can't do another one, dude.  I'm on an empty stomach.  I can't go to grow up my intestines.  The crying bit fell flat.  I know.  You're not crying.  No, it's not as strong as I thought it was going to be.  Well, what do you need?  You said you cry with Tabasco.  I don't know.  Maybe that makes it that.  No?  Well, don't swallow.  Maybe it's...  You're switching around your mouth a little bit. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  Here's Oscar trying to cry on cue with Tabasco sauce.  Nothing.  I feel nothing.  Make a joke.  You know what?  Yeah.  How about you touch the spoon with your...  Oh, I...  Now it's too late.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You licked it.  I know.  I licked the spoon.  Now put a little more in there and then touch the spoon with your fingers and then kind  of just rub it into your fingers and then rub your eyes a little.  No, I can't do that.  How am I going to drive home?  I don't know. 
[01:49:30]  You flush out your eyes.  No, I can't do that.  I'm not saying put it in.  What I'm saying is you get a little on your fingertips and then just rub it on your fingers  just so it's like residual.  Not a lot.  And then just kind of rub the inside corners of your eyes.  The tear ducts.  Yeah.  It looks like there's no Tabasco on your fingers.  No.  That's what we're looking for.  Yeah, yeah.  Just a little bit.  I'll do this one because I had cash early in my hand.  I don't get any infection.  All right.  He's dipping his very nervous finger into the Tabasco. 
[01:50:00]  Get a little on there.  No, no, no.  Rub it into your finger a little bit.  Yeah, we don't want Tabasco right in your eye.  Now go ahead.  Rub it in.  There you go.  Now just kind of rub your eye like if your eye itched.  In the corner.  In the corner.  It won't hurt in the corner.  Can I bail out on this one or...?  No.  Close your eye and rub it like your eye...  Yeah, yeah.  There.  Now just rub.  Inside the corner.  Rub your eye like your eye itches.  No, not like you're putting on eye mascara.  Nothing.  I'm not saying nothing.  Yeah?  I got nothing.  How about the inside?  Right in the inside corner.  Go ahead. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, like that.  How about when...  Like your eye itches.  There.  Did I get you?  What happened?  Yeah, a little.  Are you going to cry now?  What happened?  You're going to cry now?  I don't have it in me.  Maybe I ran out of tears.  Actually, I'm a really happy person, so maybe I don't have any tears in me.  Can we put some in your pee hole?  Oh, no, no.  That's ridiculous.  I mean...  I guess that's Tabasco.  Bobby's off the hook, by the way.  Anthony, Bobby's off the hook.  I want to help Bobby.  That line was from a movie.  Was in...  Eric in Boston.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Never mind.  Really fast. 
[01:51:00]  I think that line you're referring to is, I used to fart guys like you in prison from  the movie Roadhouse with Patrick Swayze.  It was that scene when he was fighting that guy on the river.  There you go.  The scene where he was fighting that guy.  It was actually a mixture of that scene and The Godfather.  Mo Green.  I'm such a fucking piece of shit.  Mo Green.  That's my new thing.  It's called mash-up fucking references.  Movie mash-up references.  By the way, Steven S. from Bayshore writes, don't worry, Ope, the entire audience is crying 
[01:51:30]  right now, so...  Oscar, your fucking crying bit fell miserably.  You said you could...  It works with wasabi.  All right, let's get some wasabi.  Yeah.  Can we get some wasabi?  Can we get some wasabi?  Can we get some wasabi?  Can we get some wasabi, too?  I'm just kidding.  Don't they have wasabi downstairs?  I would think they would have some wasabi.  You want to high-five her?  Yeah, I don't know.  Why isn't...  High-fiving.  Why are you high-fiving Bob?  I just thought about sushi, so I get excited about sushi. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, my God.  All right, somebody's running to get wasabi, or they're fired.  Someone run now and get wasabi.  Yes.  Is this a plug?  Can I read your plug?  Do you mind?  Yeah, go ahead.  Bob Kelly in studio, 8 o'clock.  What's up?  Oh, I just said...  I'm here.  I'm here.  That's old.  Don't put that anyone near him.  Oh, yeah.  You'll see.  All right.  There you go. 
[01:52:30]  Are we going to do more Oscar material in after the break?  Ah, yeah.  I think you should just sit in.  Yeah.  You know, just sit in.  He's third Mike, so, you know.  Any other bits you want to try?  Ah, no.  Oh, ooh, ooh.  That's right.  Tease what we want to talk about after the break.  I'm sorry, the tease?  Yeah, a little radio tease.  What are we going to talk about with Oscar after the break?  Simon, Simon, I don't know anything about...  Well, the stuff you wrote down.  What do you want to talk about?  You actually wrote shit down.  Yeah, yeah.  Michelle Obama fell through.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:53:00]  Actually, no, no, no.  He sat up in his chair.  He got all excited.  And he goes, no.  Wait, what was the oh, oh, oh?  That you said no, no, no, no.  Well, what happened?  I used to be like a really, really like a huge Apple consumer.  And what happened?  I had the iPhone 3G, right?  And what happened just recently, like a month ago, it broke.  Like, it wouldn't turn on, right?  And I got mad.  Oh, shit.  So when I call AT&T, he's like, hey, what's up?  This thing's not working.  And he was like, oh, well, see, you don't have the extension plan.  So now you have to go to Apple and pay him 30 bucks. 
[01:53:30]  He's like, no way.  I paid $500 for this cell phone.  I'm not going to give him more money.  And I said, I've been a loyal customer of AT&T for five years.  And they were like, oh, well, sorry.  I can't help you with that.  And I'm like, oh, really?  So I walked into a store, and I did the same thing.  I started picking a fight with the guy.  But he was, like, really polite.  He looked really tall and, like, blonde.  And anyways, so what happened, and I just walked out.  I was like, you know what?  I'm going to cancel my contract at AT&T, and I'm going to switch with, like, something else.  Anyway, so, okay. 
[01:54:00]  Woo.  End of story.  That's right, yeah.  I don't know where I was going with that.  I'm sorry.  That's why, I don't know why I just wrote this.  There's nothing, like, good.  Nip, nip, nip.  No, nipples.  What?  I was going to talk about nipples, but no.  Well, we'll talk about nipples.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, good tease.  A lot of guys listen to this show.  They'll enjoy a nipple discussion.  I guess.  Yeah?  What?  I guess when we get back, we can talk about, um...  You already looked at that page.  I know, I did.  Yeah, he's flipping backwards. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, oh, oh, I got it.  Oh, oh, oh.  Is this an oh, oh, oh, or an oh, oh?  No, no, no, no.  Uh, I saw an article, they were talking about, uh, most romantic cities, I guess, for couples.  Yeah.  And then Honolulu came in first place.  Well, don't give away the answer.  Oh, that gets people to tease.  Oh, okay, never mind.  When we come back, we'll...  But you already gave away number one.  And you never give away number one first.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You can tease number two, maybe.  Maybe that would be of interest to someone.  And then he just says...  He goes, you can tease number two. 
[01:55:00]  Boy, you told me to give away number two.  No, he said tease number two.  He can't read and think at the same time.  Yeah, no way.  No way.  We can talk about China and, like, there's, like, too many people in China.  No?  Yeah, all right, we can do that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, I'm against it, man.  There's too many people in the world.  See, it's a tease.  Oh, okay.  See, now, you just gave away your whole...  See, you don't go into it.  You say, hey, we're going to talk about China, apparently a big population problem.  We'll talk about more when we come back. 
[01:55:30]  You know, tease something.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll talk about some stuff when we get back.  You can't just say some stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, we'll talk about China when we get back.  No, you already...  Yeah, you already blew that tease.  Okay, find another subject.  Okay, well, we get back.  Just tease it.  Just tease it.  When we get back, Wycliffe wants to run for president of Haiti.  I don't know nothing about it, but, I mean, we could probably just touch on something.  You don't tell them.  You don't fuck it.  Neither do we.  No one knows anything about it.  No one will stay tuned if they realize you have nothing to say about it. 
[01:56:00]  The first thing you said was fine.  You just said, hey, we're going to talk about Wycliffe John running for president of Haiti.  That's perfect.  After this.  Right.  And then you go to commercial.  But you keep elaborating on it, and it's not a tease.  Oh, okay.  So now find another subject, and just tease it.  Tease it.  We're trying to teach you radio.  Oh, oh.  Okay, we get back.  We'll talk about Mike Tyson, and...  That's it.  No?  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Then what?  That wasn't much of a tease.  Mike Tyson?  We know about Mike Tyson, but you've got to tease it just a little more, like what he's  doing.  Make people want to go, like, oh, I would like to hear Mike Tyson is doing this.  No, why are you teasing the Mike Tyson story?  He was funny at The Hangover.  You guys seen that movie?  You're supposed to be teasing.  Okay, teasing.  Yeah, what's the Mike Tyson story that'll make people want to listen?  Mike Tyson...  When we get back, Mike Tyson stole his Iron Mike name. 
[01:57:00]  When we get back more.  No?  I know how he's talking about it.  He what?  He stole his Iron Mike name or something, allegedly, from another boxer.  I just gave it away right there.  Shit.  You did it again.  Anyways.  Yo, I'm running out of topics.  You are running out of topics because you're blowing all your teases.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Give us one fucking tease.  Just a good tease.  Oh, okay.  All right.  You might have to run and write more material. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You're probably going to during the break.  And also, Ant, there's a thing that happened.  Bobo showed up because he's not happy that Oscar's getting on this airtime.  Oh, no.  Fuck Bobo.  We got the new Bobo in studio right here.  Nervous Oscar.  I don't think we're in the same caliber.  Oh.  What does that mean?  No, I'm not saying I'm better than him, but I mean...  You kind of are, though, right?  I would.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just comparison.  You don't like Bobo.  I don't like the guy.  I haven't even met him.  What story is that?  Why don't you tease that right there? 
[01:58:00]  David Carradine.  Only worth 40,000 bucks.  That's giving away the whole story.  That's the headline.  I mean, I tease the headline, right?  Don't fucking look at me.  You'd probably say something like, hey, David Carradine, with all the work he did, when  we get back, we'll tell you actually what he's worth.  You'll be really surprised.  And then you go to a commercial.  Right.  People will sit back and then go like, wow, I wonder what he's worth.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  So, just tease something. 
[01:58:30]  Let me get him there.  Yeah, I'm not liking it.  Let me just get the other one.  Right here.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.  All right.  Tell him to hurry up.  He's got a little assistant now.  Good for you.  There's like some stories over there in the corner.  He can't quite reach them.  I got it.  No.  Anyways, when we get back, apparently, what's his name?  Mr. Fishburn, his daughter, in some quite explicit videos.  More details coming right up.  What the fuck? 
[01:59:00]  No.  That can only mean one thing.  Okay.  There's a movie involved, so we'll get more details later.  Let me get the article, dude.  You're not helping.  Oh.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Dude, you're not helping.  What?  Give me another example of an explicit video that doesn't involve porn.  Yeah.  Oh, you scared me that way?  Hey, that was the one I was planning.  It's a porn to me.  What is she?  Performing surgery?  No, no.  I know there's some porn involved. 
[01:59:30]  There's a video, and I didn't really have time.  Oh, excellent.  Yeah, there's a newspaper.  Just grab a story and tease it.  All right.  Just a tease.  Little tease.  Actually, I saw a documentary on beer a couple days.  That's my cup of tea.  They're beer.  My cup of tea.  My cup of tea is beer.  Yeah.  Anyways.  Yeah, I don't know where the hell was I when they made this.  This shit had me, and apparently there was a festival.  It was called the American Festival of, actually, you know.  Of beer?  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Awesome.  No, it probably has a different name.  Like, you know, it was like AAPR or something, or APR or something.  Yeah.  Anyways.  Just a little tease.  Tease this.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Tease this, right?  Yeah, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Tease this.  Awesome.  Coming right up.  Clearance, 40, 85%.  Just guess which store.  No?  That's horrible.  That was horrible. 
[02:00:30]  Hey, puss.  Bob just pointed to an ad in the paper.  Yeah.  Anyways.  I'm sure the two of them are in the what store.  They're doing a 45%.  The minor bird starts fucking.  Logan from Tampa writes, after the break, Oscar leaves the studio and goes back to interning.  And then writes, guess I could dream, huh?  Jesus, Oscar.  Are we getting the wasabi?  I want to see this kid cry.  Yeah, we got to get some wasabi.  We're going to do the wasabi thing after the break.  See, that's a tease.  Oh, cool.  Nice. 
[02:01:00]  Nice.  You know what?  When I came, I started this internship, I swear to God.  Usually don't talk after a tease.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  No, I'll say it after the break, then.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  Woo!  Shake and bank.  Shake and bank.  What the fuck is shake and bank?  Nice.  Alrighty.  No, I'll keep quiet because then I'll get blamed for not like.  We can hear you talking.  There's a microphone in front of your face. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  What?  No, nothing, nothing.  No.  After the break, I'll say what I was thinking.  Anyways.  It's a game.  It's called, guess how many times I can say, fuck in my mind.  Because I'm nervous.  Anyways, can we go to break now, please?  I need more water.  Oof.  No, I can't do that anymore.  Anyways.  Oh. 
[02:02:00]  You all right?  Yeah, I'm doing fantabulous.  Why are you still talking?  We're in break.  I know.  Oh, we're in break?  Yeah.  Oh, nice, nice.  Yeah, but you felt like we were still in the air and you just kept babbling about nothing.  I have a shitty phone now.  It's like a shitty song.  Yeah.  Oh, I just had a text message.  Can you save it for the air?  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah, stop telling you to save it.  That's good stuff for the air, dude.  Nice.  Where are you going to break?  We're on break.  You're on break, dude.  It's over.  The mic key, stay on while you...  Because they got to do the live read. 
[02:02:30]  Bobo's pissed.  Oh, man.  I'm sweating like a...  All right, you can leave.  Yeah.  We're playing commercials right now.  All right, cool.  Awesome.  You have like...  Leave?  Yeah, you have six minutes to get more material.  Oh, more material.  For when we get back.  All right, cool, cool.  I'll be right back.  All right.  Damn.  There he goes.  Need more water.  How do you think you...  First thing, dude?  What's up?  Yeah, how do you feel about your first...  That's horrible.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what I was afraid of.  Anyways.  It's not that bad.  It's okay.  The what?  The mic stay on and then... 
[02:03:00]  They do live reads, dude.  He's got to do live reads.  But they stay on, they put it back up.  You got to leave so I can do the live reads.  Yeah, great, cool.  All right.  Thanks, Oscar.  Oh, you're welcome.  I'll let you help me.  I'll throw this out.  Can you give Bobby a kiss before you leave?  No, no.  Come up with some stuff.  Come on.  A little fist bump.  Nice.  I'll throw this out.  Shake it back.  Shake it back.  You're coming back, right?  When?  What time?  A few minutes. 
[02:03:30]  You got real normal then, didn't you?  Like after the break.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll go prepare myself.  All right.  Go prepare.  The Virus Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Got Bob Kelly in studio.  Yes.  Bobby, are you promoting anything?  Yeah, I'm going to be at Marco Island.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I hear that place is awesome.  Florida.  Yeah, Marco.  I hear it's really nice.  Yeah, it's a cool little place.  Captain Brian. 
[02:04:00]  The guy who owns it.  Yeah, exactly.  The guy from Boston.  Asshole lobster fisherman or something.  Went down there and fucking owns the town because he has a successful restaurant.  What do you think, a little fucking ferry over there or something?  No, you fly into...  That's not really...  That's probably a fucking peninsula.  Do you fucking drive over a bridge?  I don't know.  I think it is a bridge.  Okay.  I think you drive over a bridge.  I know my sister, who lives in Winter Park, Florida, loves the Marco Island.  Is it good?  Yeah.  It's all to come because last time I was there, I had like five people. 
[02:04:30]  Well, you're in the middle of nowhere.  It was the down season.  What's the down season?  When nobody goes to Marco Island.  Why are you talking like that?  I have a mouthful of yogurt.  That's what it sounds like with a mouthful of cum.  Same exact thing.  It's the same consistency.  I would know.  Hey, listen.  I don't usually do this.  Yeah.  And I told you to tell me when you were going to fucking cum, but you didn't.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God damn, Bobby.  So, Anthony, don't tell Opie that just happened. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, my God.  That is fucking disgusting.  So, Marco Island when?  Next weekend or something?  You can't just say Marco Island.  No, I had a little piece of paper, but fucking Stamenke took it.  Oscar?  Oscar.  Off to Comedy Club, August 19th through the 22nd.  I'm going to be there all weekend.  Okay, two weeks.  In two weeks, I'm going to be there.  So, get your tickets now.  Very good.  And the Facebook story you just told, Ant.  Bring that to the air.  That's some good shit.  Oh, they... 
[02:05:30]  Because we talk about this.  Well, Anthony, you know, he has cameras.  We have said with this social networking, it's got to be a lot easier to rob people.  Fuck yeah.  Because you know when they're in Disney.  Yeah.  Yeah, and you know...  For a week or whatever.  Everybody is so consumed with how many friends you have.  Everybody wants...  I mean, we all are, too.  Like, you know...  I would love to have you a 60,000.  Accept, accept, accept.  I accept everybody, and then I block everybody, too.  Yeah.  But, yeah, but, you know, these people just... 
[02:06:00]  You accept anybody.  But, you know, what we do is weird, because we're accepting, like, fans of our work or  of our comedy or of the show.  Regular squares accepting people from their life.  Because they want their numbers up.  No, but they're getting, like, a kid from junior high or high school.  A lot of people from the past.  Yeah, like, that weirds me out.  You don't know if you have a hole in the wall.  That fucking weirds me out.  And there's a reason why you haven't talked to those people in many years.  So, all of a sudden, because Facebook's hot...  Yeah, because you're better than them.  No, I'm kidding.  But you're bringing in people from your past that you blew off for a real reason. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  All of a sudden, you're now friends with them again.  Yeah.  Like, you can't fucking just accept anybody.  And this guy, she accepted this guy, whatever.  They put installed cameras, much like somebody we know.  Yes.  But inside the apartment.  Not on fucking every corner of a house.  Fuck it.  Anthony watches the sun and the moon.  I don't want cameras in my house. 
[02:07:00]  How many cameras do you got?  That's top secret.  But I do have...  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  The entire perimeter is taken care of.  Is covered.  And redundantly covered in some areas.  Do you have, like, secret...  Like a frog cam and a rock cam?  Oh, my God.  Crazy.  Really?  No, they're, you know, your basic cams, but...  Like a little boy peeing cam?  Pan tilt, zoom.  Cameras in the pee hole.  Just to see who would take a look.  Or a suckle. 
[02:07:30]  The camera in the backyard that covers the pool is...  I call that incrimination cam.  I can only imagine.  I have to remember to point that, like, down sometimes.  I help you bang a 16-year-old hacker.  Before you fuck her in the taint, she locks into your system and records it.  And then I go, I'm getting fucked in prison.  Ooh, fun.  So, she actually had these cameras just installed.  They come home.  Everything's gone. 
[02:08:00]  I mean, literally just rip the fucking plasma off the TV.  It's amazing how fucking thieves...  I know you have to do that.  How do you rip the plasma off the TV, by the way?  I mean, rip the plasma off the wall.  Sorry, dude.  It's useless without the plasma.  Carry plasma with you.  Can you carry plasma?  I don't know.  How does that work?  Like a superhero?  Is it like the old days of putting mercury in your hand?  What the fuck is plasma?  Plasma.  What is plasma?  Did you put mercury in your hand as a kid?  Never.  Really?  No.  From a thermometer?  Yeah.  No, never.  You used to be able to buy it in, like, toy stores. 
[02:08:30]  No.  Like the five and dime.  And then you put it in your hand.  That's smart.  Remember that stuff the bubbles used to blow?  It was like a different colored thing.  It was like chemicals, and you'd put it on the end of a strong blood.  Super elastic bubble plastic.  It was fucking just chemical smell.  And if you blew into it, and it was blowing up, and then you accidentally kind of went  to take another breath to blow into it more, and inhaled the air that was in that thing.  You'd just pass out?  You'd fucking fall right on the floor.  It was great.  And click clacks.  Click clacks?  What the fuck is a click clack? 
[02:09:00]  It was those two balls that were like glass balls on a string with a ring.  They called it something else in Boston.  I remember this bit.  You would go tick, tick, tick.  And then the goal was to be able to go up and down and have the two balls go apart,  meet at the top.  They'd click, and then clack at the bottom.  And occasionally, which is like one out of every two, they'd explode.  The fucking things would explode.  Or you would knock yourself out.  It would hit you in the temple. 
[02:09:30]  It would hit your knuckles, too.  And it would, yeah, it would smash you in the face.  It's like what they use to catch ostrich with.  A blow or something, and you just throw them at ostrich feet.  Some days when it's really hot, I can do that with my nuts.  I can just bounce up and down.  Just click clack with your balls.  Facebook, cameras in the apartment.  They saw, they looked at the video feed, and they got the two fucking assholes.  They didn't see the cameras.  It's funny, too, that they stole all the electronics except the fucking cameras recording them. 
[02:10:00]  Except the cameras.  Yeah.  But didn't someone, oh, sorry, I wasn't sure if you were going to.  Well, they, then they just, they took the photo of the guy and posted it on Facebook.  And somebody from their Facebook was like, I know that guy, and so do you.  He's your friend.  And they sent them the link, and they were friends.  It was a guy that she went to high school with.  Was fucking stalking her fucking Facebook.  Probably knew she was gone, and they just went to the house and took it all.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't realize you should shut the fuck up. 
[02:10:30]  I mean, think about, like, she probably had, what, 50 friends?  And she got robbed.  Think about you guys.  Think about all the fucking psychos that are listening right now.  Oh, believe me, I've had people knock on my door.  We know.  Who know.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, you told me that.  I love it, fans fucking knock on the door.  Hey, I found out where you lived.  Oh, yeah?  Did you?  How about I shoot you in the face?  When you do a show like this, you deal with detectives all the time.  Trust me.  And Kerbangers.  Oh, Kerbangers, they were called. 
[02:11:00]  I don't know.  Kerbangers.  I think on Long Island, we called them Click Clacks.  They were Click Clacks, yeah.  Yeah.  Click Clacks.  And then the other favorite toy was Incredible Edibles, where you would take this liquid,  and I'm sure it was FDA approved, and put it in a mold.  Wasn't toys great back in the movie?  They just made a toy.  Hey, let the kid eat plastic.  Fuck him.  Lead man.  Yeah, yeah.  Or play with fucking molten lead to make soldiers with it.  Fuck, am I working in a foundry?  What the fuck is this? 
[02:11:30]  I'm a child.  And Incredible Edibles was a bug.  Easy Bake Oven was an oven when it first came out.  They give a kid an oven.  That was just a light bulb.  Yeah, a light bulb.  And it takes seven days to make a fucking cake.  How many times did you light your room on fire by accident with all these toys?  Oh, there were plenty of times with the hot fucking toys.  There was one by Mattel.  There was one toy that had soldering iron, to remember.  Yeah, soldering iron.  What the fuck was that for?  Well, there was one.  The one I'm talking about, Incredible Edibles.  You'd take a mold, this fucking lead mold, probably.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  And you had a metal clip that would go onto the mold.  You'd squeeze this goop into the mold, and it was usually a spider or some kind of bug.  And then shove it into this electric oven that got up to, like, fucking 2,000 degrees.  That was a toaster.  Yeah.  Then you'd pull the mold out, and there would be your Incredible Edible inside.  But the thing was blazing hot.  There were still kids with, like, right-angle burns from the corner of the molds.  And then you'd pull it out, and God knows what this shit was, but you'd eat it. 
[02:12:30]  But what was the stretchy guy?  Stretch Armstrong?  Stretch Armstrong.  That was like carrying around a sap, like a fucking weapon, a blackjack.  You hit your brother with that.  For some reason, it was very soft when you slowly mushed it.  But if you hit someone with it, it was just like a rock.  But the best part about the toys growing up, then you'd run out of the shit, and you'd have  to, like, melt your army men or something.  Oh, yeah.  You'd start doing, we call those vut vuts, where you'd take the army soldiers, light them 
[02:13:00]  with a lighter in the woods, and hold it up.  And when it melted, and the plastic would drop, flaming plastic would drop to the ground.  It would go, it made a cool sound.  The better sound, though, was when some of the plastic hit Anthony's wrist.  Holy shit.  And I ran through the woods like the little naked girl in the Vietnam photo.  Just burning.  And it wouldn't stop.  It hurt so fucking bad.  It was bad.  Hot plastic is the worst. 
[02:13:30]  It doesn't just get cold instantly.  It's on fire.  Is it worse than wax?  Burning on me.  It kept burning.  I was screaming and my friends just laughing at me.  That scab that's just black.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you can't get it off of you.  And the soldering iron just popped in my head, but I couldn't remember the fucking toy.  Thank God I got Mike here.  Mike.  Mike?  Hi, Mike.  You're on.  You guys got to be...  Ah, Mike!  You mother fucker. 
[02:14:00]  It was a wood-burning kit.  Oh, right.  A wood-burning kit.  Didn't you get a little piece of wood and then you made fucking designs with the soldering iron or something?  Yeah, you make a name plaque for yourself.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or something.  With a blazing hot soldering iron.  But then you got bored.  We had five boys in my family.  So then you used them as weapons.  Of course you did.  You'd give each other a little poke with the soldering iron.  Yeah, there it is.  Okay.  And there were different scalpel-like tips that would get fucking blazing hot.  Right.  So you could cut yourself and cauterize it all at the same time.  Then mom would call you for dinner. 
[02:14:30]  You just threw the soldering iron still fucking...  On your bed.  On your bed or on the rug.  Yeah.  Didn't think anything of it.  I mean, we weren't supposed to have responsibility.  If the toys didn't kill you, they ruined your house.  Right.  Toys back in the day.  Remember what was that spinning art thing that you just put a piece of it and spin and just squeeze the...  Yeah, you squeeze the fucking paint and it spins and it makes that thing every time.  Every time it just looked like shit.  Yeah, I'm hanging these on my wall.  This is great. 
[02:15:00]  Fucking sucks.  You'd give them to your mom and she'd instantly throw them in the garbage.  Yeah.  Fucking hard.  Here, it's for you, mommy.  Yeah, it's great.  Thanks.  I remember when I got in.  That's when you go from toys to fire.  Yeah, fire became a toy.  Remember?  Fire became a toy, right?  Pyromaniac.  Every kid was a little fire bug for a while.  Me and Ann have told our burning down the woods stories.  Yeah, burning down the woods.  You have one of those?  Yeah.  We burned down the entire woods in our backyard.  What?  And then we were fucking grounded for the entire summer. 
[02:15:30]  Man, that burned down Beauty's Hill.  Then my sick fucking parents would invite all our cousins over and they were allowed to run in this great backyard we had, which was a hill with a tree for it and all sorts of shit.  And we got to stand on the driveway all summer and watch our cousins in the woods.  We used to light this field on fire and then go find all the dead snakes.  What?  There was this field with all these fucking...  There would just be huge garden snakes.  We used to catch garden snakes.  Literally, after school, I would run to get a snake. 
[02:16:00]  Every day, we'd just go get snakes.  But then we got into fire and we...  Because we...  I think the snake bit me once.  This little faggot snake bit me and I hated snakes.  And we lit the field on fire and they just went...  We would just go and find all the dead snakes.  Like dead, burnt snakes.  Oh, big ones, little ones.  They just did this dumb snake.  Didn't know what to do.  He was still curled up in a sleeping position.  Looked like fucking sausage.  I was hoping someone would put the fire out before it was too late.  You could have been a serial killer.  That's how it starts, man. 
[02:16:30]  Killing animals.  Yeah, I nailed Beauty's Hill because a horse named Beauty was on the hill.  Jesus.  So it was known as Beauty's Hill.  And I would play them with matches and my brother decided to hold my foot when I went  to stomp it out for a little longer.  Well, because you want to see how big you get.  Yeah.  And then it got a little too big for our little sneakers.  It got a little too big for our little sneakers to put it out.  And that's the fire I blamed on Negroes.  When the fire department came, one fireman was holding me. 
[02:17:00]  And because I was...  It was before kindergarten for me.  I was a real little kid.  And he goes, what happened here?  Did you see who did this?  And I was like, yeah, it was Negroes.  He blamed it on Negroes.  I have a very similar story, but I'll cut to the chase when the fire department came  and lined us up.  Me, my brother Scott and Darren.  I blamed it on oily rags in the woods because I learned that in school.  You blamed it on Mexicans? 
[02:17:30]  Oily rags.  Spontaneous combustion.  Right.  Well, he said, you know, oily rags can cause fucking fire.  I blamed black people.  I feel bad for that.  I did that.  You blamed black people for something?  The first time I got arrested for something legitimate, we blamed it on...  We were just like three black kids did it.  And we live in the Italian part of town in Medford.  You know, Boston's like segregated still where the blacks live over at Duggar Park and the  Italians live over at... 
[02:18:00]  There's no black...  There wasn't a black kid around ever.  And if there wasn't a mob-owned restaurant, and we're like, three black kids, really?  Did they?  Did they?  They couldn't even get on the street.  Well, they don't serve them here.  Exactly.  It's Boston.  Jesus.  I don't know.  I always found that odd that it was before I was even in kindergarten.  And you knew to blame black people.  I was blaming black people.  Why is that?  It's absolutely my upbringing.  Of course it was the upbringing.  Listening to my father just drop the N-bomb every fucking two seconds. 
[02:18:30]  Every two seconds.  The effing...  And that was it.  Are you proud that you beat his record?  Oh, wow.  I mean, my grandfather was...  Yes.  I know.  I'm still working on his record.  My grandfather was racist, but not...  How do you say this?  He wasn't...  He was just from fucking 1910.  So he would call the neighbors coloreds.  Yeah, yeah.  But not because he was racist.  That's just what he did. 
[02:19:00]  You know what I mean?  And he had to tell them, pop, you don't...  But it was actually acceptable years ago to say, yeah, there's a colored family across  the street or something.  Right, yeah.  And then it was the Negroes that live with it.  Like, it just...  It changed.  But then, you know, if you don't keep up with the changing words...  I told you that.  You seem a little odd.  The first black chick I ever went with, in love with her, a chick named Debbie from  sixth grade, met when I was 18.  Yeah, but how did she spell it?  D-E-B-B-I-E. 
[02:19:30]  She, uh, Debbie Debbie.  Sorry, Debbie.  She was smoking, though.  And I mean, I was at a gorgeous stage in my life.  Really good looking.  I remember we met with, I had Z-Cavarici's with suspenders.  The gorgeous state of his life.  The, uh, the sideways zipper, the angled Z-Zipper.  Wow.  The bullfighter pants.  Remember the bullfighters?  The bullfighter pants.  Remember them?  They were pleated and you pulled them up over your belly button.  Oh, God damn it.  Can you fucking Google that shit?  Yeah, I see that.  And they were, uh, tail green or some shit like that, or whatever, blue, watery green. 
[02:20:00]  I actually fucking wore that?  Oh, dude.  Are you out of your mind?  I was at, I was at fucking Club Narcissus.  Ha ha!  Remember Club Narcissus?  No.  You remember, you guys know.  Remember Lansdowne Street and Faneuil Hall?  I mean, uh, the Fenway.  We were only there for three years.  All right.  Yeah.  I was there and I met this broad.  People have us born and raised up there.  We did three lousy years.  Oh, my God.  And then I got kicked out.  No way.  What is that?  That was a knickers.  Knickers.  Yeah.  Is that what you used to wear?  Something like that?  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  Anyway, go ahead, Debbie.  Black girl.  She, uh, I just bought one of those, by the way.  What, are you Oscar all of a sudden?  She, no, I just, I just bought that.  The Wonderphile?  Why did you buy the Wonderphile?  Oh, God.  I swear to God.  You get two of them, though.  You get two of them.  Well, they always give you two because they want you to pay for the separate shipping.  Just pay separate shipping.  Yeah.  It's the worst thing ever.  Do you know why?  You need a fucking, like, a commander's table to open that up every time. 
[02:21:00]  You need literally a fucking warehouse to open the stupid thing up.  You don't think, look how big that is.  Look at the table she's doing this on.  No one has a table big enough to open that fucking thing on.  No.  Look at that.  You can't take it.  We don't do the stress.  Perfect for teachers and moms.  Yeah.  You need to, look at the size of that.  The bed.  They don't show it ever at Starbucks.  Hobbies and collectors.  Tipping people's coffees over.  Why would you need the wonderful?  And retarded comedians.  B, first of all, I just need things to make me feel better late at night so I can go to sleep. 
[02:21:30]  Just to buy shit.  Oh, do I want that egg thing so bad?  What?  The stupid fucking one that mixes the egg inside the shell?  Inside the fucking shell, Anthony.  Who needs that?  Who doesn't need that?  You can't crack your own eggs.  But you can do other things with that.  You can make a protein shake with that.  Yeah, you can.  You can just fucking crack your own eggs.  It's something you don't need.  The commercial shows that one lousy piece of eggshell destroyed that woman's life when she bit into the muffin.  She was very, yeah. 
[02:22:00]  Is it really that much of a problem?  You ever try to get an eggshell out of a pan at the exit and you burn your little fingertip and you're going to keep doing it?  You just fucking cook your omelette with the dumb eggshell in there.  It's like trying to get a wedding ring out of a fucking batch of jizz.  It's hard to do.  You like the egg cracker thing?  I would get that in a second, yeah.  And I told you, my wife woke up in the middle of the night one time and fucking grabbed the phone out of my hair and threw it against the wall.  I was ordering a wok.  Why?  I just thought we needed a wok.  It was a special.  I was in this stage of my life where I was ordering everything. 
[02:22:30]  And in the middle of the night I'd be like, yeah, can I get the extra packet of chopsticks?  How much is that?  She came in, grabbed the phone and threw it against the wall.  We don't need a wok.  Separate shipping on the chopsticks?  These commercials are talking to people like you, Bobby.  Oh, fuck that.  I'd laugh at those dumb things.  I'll watch the commercials.  First of all, that's because you're a billionaire.  No, man.  I don't like clutter in my house.  I don't want all those fucking gadgets in my house.  Gadgetry.  That I'm going to use maybe once and then realize what a waste of time it is. 
[02:23:00]  You might use it once.  The air mall?  What about Debbie the Black Girl?  Oh, yeah.  Debbie the Black Girl.  Then we'll get back to the water file.  So we were on the date.  First of all, I met her at her house over in Roxbury, which I never been there.  It's scary as shit.  It's like all black people.  Back then it was scary as shit.  I was like, oh, my God.  I went to her house.  She came out of the house with a bowl of peaches.  Why?  I don't know, dude, but it was the sexiest, most African thing I've ever seen.  And she was like, hey, baby, you want some peaches? 
[02:23:30]  I was like, yeah, no, but yes, I will.  And she fed me peaches.  She had no spoon or nothing.  What the fuck is that move?  Oh, I just licked them off her face.  Oh, it was just sexy.  And how old were you?  Tribal shit.  How old was this?  I had to be like 18, 19, something like that.  Did you eat her peach?  No.  We actually went on.  Black girls don't like.  No, I think they like it, but the rumor is black guys don't do it.  Yeah, black guys don't do it.  Why?  I don't eat these coaching unless it's fried. 
[02:24:00]  Is it because, you know.  Yeah, it looks like a wallet.  Because it, you know.  It smells a little bit?  Yeah.  It smells different?  Yeah.  Yeah, a little bit.  No.  It does not.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, like Indian girls, Spanish girls, white girls, black girls, everybody smells different.  They all got a different smell based on race.  What girl smells the worst?  Shit, I'm not saying that.  Not a name.  I'm talking like a black girl, a Puerto Rican girl, Indian girl, white girl. 
[02:24:30]  In my experiences at strip clubs, I have noticed that the black girl's pussy really was not very appealing to me.  Really?  As far as fragrance went.  Yes.  The white Russian chick was fine as she ground her fucking groin into my face.  Right.  And then there was a black chick that was trying to hone in on the lap dance because I'm tossing 20s out like they're fucking Tic Tacs.  But the Russian girls, the Russian girls always have shitty fucking like dye jobs and a mole somewhere. 
[02:25:00]  Some fucked up German shepherd mole somewhere in their body.  German shepherd.  Ugh.  What is up with the mole thing?  I don't know, but they just fucking.  The whole part of the fucking world.  Oh.  What happened over there?  Nothing happened in Eastern Europe.  Yeah, some one ugly Russian fucked everybody.  Like, you see the Russian strippers, you're right.  They're just.  But the one mole takes it completely out.  And it's risen.  It's always in a bad place, too. 
[02:25:30]  You don't like it, the sexy mole?  You don't like it, my friend?  It's very sexy.  I make the sexy mole dance for you.  I call him Teddy.  Anything worse than a mole with two lousy hairs growing out of it?  Ah.  At least fucking get rid of the hair part of it.  Yeah.  Oh, just get rid of it.  Cut it out yourself and sew it shut.  I didn't mind the Russian chick.  I don't think she had a mole.  I don't remember.  You don't remember moles?  Guagamole.  I don't remember the mole.  Well, but, yeah.  So the black chick came over and tried to hone in on the lap dance. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Like, oh, it's going to be two chick lap dance.  Yeah.  And she started, like, getting a little close.  And I'm backing away.  Like, fucking just backing away.  And she was just sweating.  She was sweating.  He's pulling out fucking car trees and putting it on her cliff.  Believe me, I was just, like, fucking, because the smell coming out of there was, wow.  Yeah, there's definitely a difference.  Chinese, Asian girls, you know, the Chinese girls have a different smell.  Everybody has different smells.  It's the food you eat and the, you know, the perfume, like, you know. 
[02:26:30]  It could, but just because she was sweating like a monster.  It was fucking crazy.  Yeah.  Well, but, uh, so anyway, me and Debbie were on the date, and I, this was at the time where  they just went to African-American from black.  Remember?  It was black.  What is it now?  And then it went Afro-American for, like, 10 minutes.  It was just Afro-American.  And then it went black.  And then it went to African-American.  African-American.  Yeah.  It was colored.  It was what Anthony says, then colored.  Then.  No, Negro. 
[02:27:00]  Negro.  Colored.  Afro-American.  African-American.  Why is it colored bad?  No, you forgot black.  You forgot black.  Yeah, yeah.  Black.  Black was right before Afro-American.  Black will be bad now, too.  Black, Afro-American, African-American.  Here's a weird thing, though, is that black people at a comedy club can go, uh, white waitress.  And it's not offensive to anybody.  Oh, yeah.  I heard it in Philly.  They were like, white waitress.  Get the white waitress.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Like, to describe the person.  Because it was, uh.  What do you need?  No tipper? 
[02:27:30]  What?  It's proven.  I'd like to disagree, but I was a waiter for fucking three years.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I just walked out.  You will never hear a waiter or a waitress dispel that.  I just walked over.  I was like, what's up, guys?  I was just, you know what?  I know.  Let's just be friends.  I'm going to treat you like family.  You're not tipping me.  Yeah.  I'm not even taking a tip.  Good.  Yeah.  You're not getting one.  Well, you know what it is?  I talked to Patrice about this.  There was a thing where somebody was complaining about having to tip 20% over 80 bucks.  And they were like, look, I only, I want to do this, but I only have 80 bucks. 
[02:28:00]  It's 80.  I can't afford to fucking do this.  And you don't fucking buy $80 worth of shit.  That's the fucking way it goes.  And wait a minute, too.  English people don't tip for shit.  No.  And when you go out of the country, if you go to Aruba, they make you, they trick you  into double tipping.  They add the tip on the fucking check.  And then you say, what's the tips here?  And they're like, yeah, but that goes to the fucking management takes that. 
[02:28:30]  They get a small percentage of that.  Then you tip again.  So you're literally tipping like 30 or 40% half the time.  You're right.  Better be.  Yeah.  You got to be careful over when you go out of the country.  Better be damn good service, motherfucker.  Fucking the Dutch.  They just, they fucking suck.  They talk too much and they don't get sarcasm.  Sam's jumping in because he says most black people don't like being called African American.  Not now.  It's changed.  What happened?  That must be a good one.  No.  People who come from the islands, Caribbean people, Bohemian people, people like that.  Yeah.  If you call them African American, they get very offended. 
[02:29:00]  They're like, I'm not fucking African American.  I'm not African.  I don't know anybody from Africa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well.  So what do they like being called?  They don't mind being called black.  Yeah.  Well, black's easy.  Black is what I think most black people.  Like black and white.  You say I'm white.  There was a white guy over there.  But they're not black.  A white chick.  They're colored.  Well, we're not white.  Jesus.  That's up, Grandpa.  I think if I was black, I'd rather be called colored than black.  I think black is the term.  There's no black people out there.  Well, it's white. 
[02:29:30]  Different shades of colors.  But we're called white.  We're not white.  Yeah, we're a color.  Yeah.  We're honkies.  Honkies.  We're peach.  We're peach.  You're peach.  Thank you.  So anyways, me and Debbie were on the date.  Everything was going amazing.  And the type of black girl that I really fall for is that thin track star.  Yeah.  Like long legs.  With the high hiney.  High ass.  You could put a beer on the back of it and rest it.  And the afro.  I like the afro. 
[02:30:00]  I don't like the fake.  I don't like the hair.  I like the weave of the tracks.  You know, I dated a black girl with tracks and I got kinky.  And she was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, motherfucker.  Don't mess with my hair.  These will come out.  You know what I mean?  And it was like, oh, shit.  That would be a bad day for her.  She had the afro.  She was gorgeous, man.  Just, oh, my God.  I would have married this chick.  And we were on the date.  And I parked near the Mystic River.  That was my romantic spot.  I used to find.  I used to have spots that I would go to where I could bang a chick, finger bang a chick, 
[02:30:30]  get a blowjob or just make out.  Like, this is my romantic.  I wasn't trying anything here.  I would imagine if you're finger banging, it's a bad spot.  Yeah, finger banging was like there was a Dunkin' Donuts in South Boston that I could just finger bang a chick at.  A make out spot, that's some nice views.  Make out spot.  That's for a woman you're thinking, you know what?  I'm going to go long term with her.  It's a finger banging spot.  That's like, I'm just hoping my friends don't fucking drive by this location.  What a fantastic finger banging spot. 
[02:31:00]  I used to have a fuck spot.  It was like, you know the highways, the rotaries?  Right.  There was a big rotary in fucking, I don't know, Woburn or somewhere.  Woburn.  Woburn.  And in the, there was one spot, if you look, I saw a cop going up it and you could drive like up and be in the middle on top of this fucking rotary, kind of looking down.  Nobody could see you.  And I saw this road one time and it was my fuck spot.  But I would literally be driving around a rotary and then we'd just go up in the fucking thing, up into this hill through the trees and be up. 
[02:31:30]  It was just weird.  Like James Bond shit.  This is fucking voomping.  I wouldn't go anywhere.  I saw the cops.  Yeah, really.  That means they'd go there a lot.  Yeah.  Come on.  What are you going to do?  What are they going to do?  They're not going to fucking, in Boston, catching a kid like me banging.  Get the fuck out of there.  Get out of there.  Fucking put your pants on.  You, girl, stay.  Let me see some fucking.  You're sucking this.  Identificate.  Yeah.  Let me, show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The sexiest scene in fucking movie history. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, like that.  Fucking guy's jerking off on the side of the cop.  That's why I couldn't be a cop.  Why I couldn't be a cop?  You would never give a girl a ticket.  I could never have a gun or a badge.  Because I'll fucking kill somebody because my rage is real.  Unlike some assholes with fucking beards that don't connect and it ends in a punchline,  I end in fucking jail.  I'll kill somebody.  And I will fucking stab somebody.  And I will fucking use the badge to pussy.  You'll make your girl get naked just because she was speeding.  I would take all comers. 
[02:32:30]  All comers.  All bribes.  Right.  I wouldn't be the guy.  You'd be that guy.  I don't do that.  You do what you do.  I don't do that.  He's a dirty cop.  I am.  I'm obsessed with your finger banging spot.  Was it a polluted creek or something?  No.  I had Dunkin'.  It was really Dunkin' Donuts?  I had Dunkin' Donuts.  It had to be in the back though, right?  It was a South Boston one.  Nobody ever went to.  I think it was the original fucking Dunkin' Donuts.  Was it right next to the dumpster?  Yeah.  No.  It was the side.  You know Dunkin' Donuts?  You have the front and then there's the side.  She's not good enough for the front, right? 
[02:33:00]  The person that used to work there would always park on the side, but leave the one between  the dumpster and the car.  So I'd always pull in there.  That must make a woman feel good.  Yeah.  That's like, yeah.  Here we are.  Well, it's better than my-  Isn't this great?  My other spot was next to me.  That's the place to be.  When you're finger banging a bra, take her to Dunkin' Donuts.  She had to know.  I need that $80.  She had to know she wasn't worth shit. 
[02:33:30]  That's the side of a Dunkin' Donuts.  It was either that or the railroad tracks.  There was the Playstead Park.  I used to park near the tennis courts, walk through the woods, and there was a little opening  near the tracks.  Wow.  And that used to be my all-around fuck.  That's a little more romantic, right?  Not really.  It was in the dirt.  It was in the dirt?  You'd just come back and just be dirty.  Like, just dirt.  I mean, but like that powdery dirt.  Like, someone just dug some shit there. 
[02:34:00]  It was always just dirt.  And like, broken beer bottles and shit.  Cigarette butts.  Just finger banging a chicken, a rhubarb patch.  But, uh, so me and this product, I took her to my romantic spot.  Really romantic, where other lovers would go.  The good spot, right?  Yeah, you felt comfortable.  There was other people.  Yeah.  And we were talking, and I was so nervous.  Because it was the first black chick I've ever been with.  And she, uh...  It's intimidating, right?  Yeah, because she's so different, man. 
[02:34:30]  She came up with a bowl of peaches with no spoon.  That's weird.  And asked me, you want peaches, baby?  I was like, oh.  And we learned many years ago that they want you to put a little N into it.  They want you to put a little N into it.  Yeah.  They have, they fuck a little N into it.  It's just a code word.  They want you to put a little N into it.  A little rhythm.  You haven't heard that one yet?  We did a whole fucking show on it, man.  Here's the thing, man.  We think we're crazy, man.  They'll start calling, and they'll agree with us.  Black girls want you to put a little N into it.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  She didn't.  She didn't. 
[02:35:00]  Maybe she did.  Maybe she never called me back.  Oh.  But no, what happened was, is she was in the car, and she's like, are you all right?  And I'm like, I'm nervous.  She's like, why?  And I go, because I never.  My wallet?  Terrible.  That my friends might come by?  They fucking fight everybody like the Bronx tale.  So, my wallet.  This is terrible. 
[02:35:30]  So she's.  Why?  This is right when they went from black to Afro-American or African-American.  And I didn't know what the fucking term was.  So I just went, I never dated a colored girl before.  In that Boston accent, though, which makes it worse.  I never dated a colored girl before.  Before.  So she would flip.  Like, I ain't colored, motherfucker.  What the fuck is that?  I ain't fucking.  And I was like.  What do I call you?  What do I call you, people?  What do I call you? 
[02:36:00]  I don't know.  But she recovered, man.  She actually was a cool broad.  She was like, look, let's forget about this shit.  It's fine.  Let's move on.  Okay?  And we went home and she sucked my dick and fucked me like I've never.  Really?  The only thing that sucked, it was probably the, oh my God, just to see this fucking gorgeous  black chick with the abs and that high ass and the, the only thing, the tits were a little  sandwich baggy.  You know what I mean?  A little fucking, ah, I don't give a shit though.  This tight.  Like, there's some kind of issue going on.  Stretch marks? 
[02:36:30]  All black girls have stretch marks because of the pigment in their skin.  We all have stretch marks too.  You just can't see them because we're white.  Oh, what a fucking, oh, what a fucking cunt.  What a dick.  What a fucking child.  So, uh, the only thing that sucked is right, she sucked my, dude, she put her hands in  between my legs, cupped my ass and balls and sucked my cock. 
[02:37:00]  Wow.  I, and I, I came in her mouth and she took it and I was like, oh my God, the only thing  that sucks is like I, before she blew me, I had made two really cool cappuccinos with  my new cappuccino maker, which that means you're, you're on the elite list of bitches  because I don't just make, it took a while back then.  Of course.  That they was, remember those cappuccinos?  That would take forever, yeah.  And she had it and she just spit my load into the cup and it immediately just turned to 
[02:37:30]  egg and then it was just, it just ruined it.  It was like, ah, fuck.  What's the matter?  She didn't want to finish like a good girl?  And you know me.  So, she didn't want to, she didn't swallow.  She took it and then spit it out.  Some girls do that, man.  That's some fucked up shit to me that you'd put it in your mouth, taste it.  That's the fucked up part of cum.  Now all you have to do is put it in your stomach and let it die.  Jeez.  You are a hopeless romantic.  I love how you describe love. 
[02:38:00]  Well, you know, when I learned how to drink, my friend used to be able to literally take  a pint of Southern Comfort and one sip it.  Shug it, yeah.  And he taught me that you have to put your tongue down because if it hits your tongue  and you taste it, that's when you gag and you can't do it.  But if it just hits the back of your throat, he literally just opened up his throat and  it would just go down and he wouldn't taste any of it.  It's the same thing with sucking a conk.  I would imagine if you just put your stupid tongue down and let it hit the back of your  throat.  Good, I was imagined, by the way.  Yeah, I'm kidding.  Did you like that?  I like the addition of, I would imagine. 
[02:38:30]  Cut that in it.  Come on.  Cut that in.  In the nick of time there, Bobby.  Come on, motherfucker.  You're a cocksucker, Anthony.  You snuck that in nice.  Ah, you're blowing up my spot.  My fucking spot.  My fucking spot, you cocksucker.  We didn't forget about Oscar and the wasabi has arrived.  I did.  Oh, good.  Well, he said he could cry if he ate some Tabasco.  That didn't work.  So then he said, well, wasabi will definitely make him have it.  You want to make him cry?  Yeah.  Pluck one asshole hair. 
[02:39:00]  Is that your trick on Louie?  Louie, pull an asshole hair for the crying scene.  So why don't we take a break and we'll get Oscar back in here?  And then Bobo wants to, what does Bobo want?  He wants to reclaim his seat, his position as...  He has absolutely lost his seat to Oscar.  He's really pissed off that Oscar has come in here like he runs the place.  He doesn't think Oscar's paid any dues.  He doesn't like the fact that Oscar's in his seat. 
[02:39:30]  And he thinks he's quite frankly better on the air than Oscar.  You're very nasally today, Sam.  Yeah, what's going on?  I'm not nasally.  Yes, you are.  Very nasally.  And he's very concerned that you are a little nasally today.  That's just what my voice sounds like.  Oh, is it just your voice?  Mm-hmm.  Is your voice ever going to like...  Yeah, change.  Are your balls ever going to drop?  This is it.  That's it?  It was higher at one point and now it stays here.  I think you should start smoking.  I'm not going to start smoking.  That might help.  I think smoking is good for you. 
[02:40:00]  It would be good.  Let's turn the kids out to smoking.  Not a bad idea.  People don't understand that my body is a temple.  And so the things that I put into it are things that I have to have a certain value for.  That's terrific, Sam.  That's good.  We're going to have Oscar on next, crying.  Is he going to bring more topics to the show, too?  Yeah, he's been researching.  And then Bobo wants to reclaim his fucking seat.  He thinks he can do it.  That Oscar's taking over.  Yeah.  We've got some stuff to do still.  I can't believe anyone is still listening to this show. 
[02:40:30]  You're listening to O.B. Anthony.  Heading toward the weekend.  I like that.  D-Rock Radio on Twitter.  You got some pictures of Oscar, I see.  Very good.  Gravity Kills.  I cannot.  No.  Hey, who is this?  I like this song.  Stabbing Westbrook.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  Stabbing Westbrook. 
[02:41:00]  This was an AF song.  Yep.  What's the name of the song?  I forgot.  It's killing me.  Save Yourself?  Save Yourself, right.  Right, right, right.  That picture of Oscar in that much-too-short chair is hysterical.  I like it.  Where is that?  E-Rock Radio.  Ah.  E-Rock does a pretty good job with the pictures.  What's that other account you got?  The OA Photos?  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, OA Photos.  I just found a whole bunch more that we're going to be putting up this weekend. 
[02:41:30]  I got thousands of pictures at home.  I'm trying to figure out what to do with them.  Thousands?  I have thousands.  No joke.  Do you need a flatbed scanner?  I've been looking.  I need some kind of program where I can just fucking have some kind of like O&A photo album  online or something.  I don't know.  Something.  You mentioned it.  I don't feel like tweeting thousands of pictures.  You mentioned it a couple times.  In the last several months, I've been looking really hard for Pete Johnson with the dildo.  The chin dildo?  The chin dildo.  If you can find that picture.  I'm trying to find that.  I know we put that on the website back in the day. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Bob Kelly back in studio.  Yeah.  Went out for a...  Smoking.  Smoking.  Smoking.  Oh, I'm back smoking and I'm fucking dropping weight.  I'm smoking and loving it.  Oh, I love it.  Yeah.  That's all it takes to drop weight is to get back on the smoking.  Dude, not smoking.  Or eating right and exercising.  I'm eating right too.  No, but I hear this all the time.  You're fucking smoking and all of a sudden you fucking drop the weight.  It's not so much smoking makes you drop the weight.  It's if you stop smoking, you get fatter. 
[02:42:30]  It just curbs your appetite, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I quit smoking, dude, I immediately put on like fucking 10 pounds and then it just  started tumbling on my tits.  How many fats you got left?  I got three fats left.  Are you sure?  I definitely have.  I think you're down to two, man.  You know what?  I think they're getting...  It used to be I'd get fat for like four years and then be skinny for two and then fat for  three.  Now it's like I was skinny for two and then I was fat for like eight months and now I'm 
[02:43:00]  back on the horse.  The fats aren't left.  I respect you for coming up with that concept because it's something I think a lot of people  just deal with.  Oh, yeah.  You have a bunch of fats you're going to go through in your life.  Yeah.  You don't just stay skinny forever.  You go back and you get rid of one of your fats.  Yeah.  And you got three left, you're saying.  Maybe two.  You're right.  Maybe two.  What happens after the next two fats?  Then I just get that hard old man's stomach that you can literally shoot with a shotgun 
[02:43:30]  and nothing happens in thin fucking chicken legs.  The barrel fucking stomach.  It's called visceral fat.  Visceral fat.  That's when the fat attaches to the muscle under the...  You get the fat that you can jiggle, that comes off.  Visceral fat will just fucking stop your heart.  Holy shit.  You ever get into a confrontation with an old guy?  Yes.  Not saying I have, but I'll just say this much.  Where the fuck does the strength come from?  Old guy strength? 
[02:44:00]  Old guy strength.  You got to watch that shit.  Wait a minute, stop.  You fought an old guy?  Over what?  This better be like life or death, Ovi.  It wasn't that big of a deal, really.  Was it a cab?  It was a problem I had on the golf course when we weren't working.  You fought a guy on the fucking golf course?  Over what?  Tea time?  He might have hit his ball into me a little too close for my comfort.  Ah, didn't wait until you were out of the way?  It wasn't...  Whatever.  It wasn't an all-out fight. 
[02:44:30]  It's a boring story.  You grabbed his wrist and thought he could take the club?  It got to that point, yes.  It got to the point where there was a little confrontation, and you realize, holy shit,  this motherfucker is strong.  And there's not a hint of a muscle in the guy.  It's because he was probably Captain America back in World War II, fucking killed a bunch  of fucking Japs.  Now he's fighting a ginger on a golf course.  Oh, shit.  I had my force in my plate with every...  I forgot what day.  I think it might have been Tuesday at Crab Meadow. 
[02:45:00]  Fucking beating up Judge Smales.  But these guys were all old fucking war veterans, and they would brag about their latest operation.  Opie?  The one guy...  Put him up, Opie.  I'm going to fight Opie Pookie.  Okay.  What's the club he had?  What was the club he had?  Keep out of this Spalding.  I wish there was...  I'm going to fight you here at Bushwood, sir.  What was the club he had?  The club?  The old Billy Beru.  I'm going to hit him with the old Billy Beru. 
[02:45:30]  I wish there was more to the story.  It never got to a point where we were wrestling and rolling around the fucking fairway, but  there was hands put on each other, and I realized, holy shit, this guy's really fucking strong.  I am completely distracted.  See, like an Adam Sandler fighting boss Bob Barker.  Yeah.  One of the best car chases ever.  Is this happening right now?  No, it's a video.  This guy is a fucking animal up on the sidewalks, fucking just ran into a car for no reason.  He was pitted once, and then a cop, they went to pin him in. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, what a good move.  And he got out of it.  When was this?  Yesterday?  It looks like Grand Theft Auto.  I know.  He must play GTA.  This looks just like fucking GTA.  The old version, when you had to fucking do it from the sky.  Oh, the top view.  The top view.  Yeah, the helicopter view.  This guy's just...  He's not going very far, either.  He just keeps going around in circles.  He's driving fast and weaving like a maniac.  Yeah, but as soon as you know, they've got a helicopter in the sky.  There it is.  There it is.  Why would you bother?  Come on, now.  Just bash him!  But yeah, the helicopter in the sky, why wouldn't you just give up at that point? 
[02:46:30]  You're not going to run a helicopter.  Because as a cop, you want to fucking slam into this guy.  Look, this guy is a maniac.  He's just doing circles.  And he's weaving in and out of traffic.  What do you think his mistake's going to be?  He's going to run into a tree or another car.  Hopefully a baby carriage.  Oh, God.  He is fucking tooling down that side road.  What do you think the mistake is?  They hit the back end of the car?  Spin him out?  Let's play.  Ten bucks.  I think he hits a tree. 
[02:47:00]  All right, you say tree.  Bobby, what do you say?  Or a parked car.  Ten bucks a man.  I say he's going to hit a pole.  A cop comes to the side and hits the back.  I say he flips the car, too.  Flips the car.  You think it's going to be a flip?  I think he's going to flip it.  Is this live?  No, it's a video.  Then why are they showing the whole clip?  I don't know.  I guess they were just...  I bet you this is live.  This has to be live.  It just says new video from Los Angeles.  This happens every day in Los Angeles.  It's just amazing for their fucking car chases.  The first pilot I ever book was called Adrenaline Run, and I was an adrenaline runner, and we 
[02:47:30]  would be the guys who chase these guys.  Really?  And they would show this real footage and base the story around this footage.  Like, put the story before it and after it.  Oh.  And then they'd just reenact the last part, and we'd jump out of the car and get the  guy.  Fuck, it just U-turned it.  Yeah, this guy is in the...  Oh!  Nice work.  All right, right into a car.  Now the cop's got to get him.  Oh, they pinned him in.  They hit his door.  He's pinned in.  He's pinned in.  Guns out like crazy.  Oh, it's great.  Just shoot him.  Hope it's a baby. 
[02:48:00]  Drag him out of that fucking car.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  That'd be great.  Did someone just start running?  No, okay.  Oh, it might have been a hostage.  It was the minivan chick.  Shit, the hostage.  Yeah, the minivan chick was like, ah!  Just like GTA.  When they go running.  Now they'll gently put him on the ground, I'm sure.  This is going to be good.  Hurry, hurry, get him out.  Oh, it's a whole car full of people.  There's people in the back seat, too, yeah.  Just throw an M80 in there.  Flash bang. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, they're busting out the windows.  Oh, he punched him right in the face.  Oh, he punched the guy right in the face.  They're busting out the back window.  Oh, he's fucking punching a guy in the back seat.  That's fantastic.  Oh, it's like Attack of the Zombies.  This is great.  Holy shit.  Oh, he just punched him again.  He doesn't know that he's...  Look at this motherfucker, you dumb fuck.  He's in trouble.  There's some...  Oh, yeah.  Come on, hit him again.  Is this guy not fucking...  Just tase the whole car.  Oh, the cop is reaching in and slugging this guy in the face.  And now he's got the gun.  Now he's got his gun on him. 
[02:49:00]  All right, now they've got a door open.  All right, drag these people out.  All right, you want another guy kicking out the back window.  Oh, boy.  Oh, this is...  What a great fucking chase.  This is like ants taking away a cricket.  Oh, yeah.  They're ready to...  Yeah, they're ready to disassemble this car.  They're ready to drag this fucking...  The cop reaching in.  Oh, he's macing him.  He's just macing him.  Macing, punching him.  There's at least one guy in the back seat.  More mace.  This guy ain't coming out of the back seat. 
[02:49:30]  Now they're all backing off a little bit.  That means they might be fucking smoke bombing.  Taser.  Tase the motherfucker.  There's a chick.  Is that a chick cop pointing something at him?  What the fuck?  Can we get this on TV?  Just tase it.  All right, back door's opening.  It's time for more Good Day New Year.  Oh, my God.  Look at the hat on this motherfucker.  Now take him down.  Oh, they just smashed his face on the hood of the car.  Oh, shit.  Reverend Al's going to be pissed.  Oh, shit.  Reverend Al's going to be pissed.  Shit, yo.  Oh, he's resistant a little bit. 
[02:50:00]  And ended.  And under control.  Right now it's 630 in Southern California.  Wow.  And if you hang with his long hours.  That's fantastic.  All right.  That is fantastic.  They smashed his face on the fucking roof of the car.  But it's so funny.  There's always that one cop that has to be in on it.  Oh, yeah.  Like, has to be in.  Grab that arm and twist it back.  Yeah, everything's fine and under control.  And the one guy just running up, grabs the arm and just twists it back.  It's like Girls Go Wild where you always see that one guy just standing in the back.  As soon as the tit comes out, he runs up and just shakes the tit.  That's to grab the tit. 
[02:50:30]  That psycho has to touch the tit.  That one cop punching that guy is fantastic.  That was a great chase.  Great chase.  Guy did a good job driving.  And then once you hit something, it's over, Johnny.  Just fucking give up.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's move.  Okay.  Why don't we get Oscar in here, Anthony?  Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar's back.  Did a great, great hour with us earlier.  It wasn't a fight on the golf course, really.  I'm not going to over-represent it.  It was a confrontation.  Did you lay hands? 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  That's a fight.  Ah, then it was like, then it just kind of broke up.  How did it break up, though?  Then it was, you're having sex with the Lacey Underalls in my bedroom.  I think I realized that it would be kind of insane to, you know, attempt to beat up an  old man and get my ass kicked out of a fucking golf course.  Just him on top of you in the mount position with his fucking old man balls in your face  going, son, have you had enough, son?  Yes.  Yes.  I give. 
[02:51:30]  There he is.  He's back.  Oscar's back.  Oscar taking a very low seat.  Right.  Now you feel a little more comfy now that you're coming in for the second time?  Absolutely, yes.  I've heard it coming.  Absolutely, yes.  I'm setting up the fucking Oscar cam.  Yeah, Oscar cam is being set up.  We got Oscar cam and we got, I think you could talk now there.  Nice.  Nice, right.  Oh, yeah.  Are you more relaxed now?  Yeah, I just went and did a little research, but then since I can't keep concentration while  reading articles, that just failed.  So I listen to a little music. 
[02:52:00]  I listen to some Muse on the YouTube.  You listen to music to prepare?  Muse.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But how is that preparing, though?  No, it just relaxes me because that's what I needed.  How about you talking to the mic a little better?  Oh, okay, yeah.  I should do that.  I like this.  Let's get this down.  Anything you ask him.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  It's like, so you look okay.  Is that what you're doing?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Kind of has like a John Candy, a Jim Belushi, a Barney Rubble. 
[02:52:30]  Barney Rubble.  And fucking Chong.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You guys see that documentary on the bio with John Candy?  That was a good documentary a couple of months ago.  What was good about it?  Oh, it was just looking back in his life.  I really wanted to be a football player, but he just ended up taking up acting because  of a knee injury.  Oh, that's a shame.  A lot of people like that, you know, it's like you just have an injury and they just  end up doing something else.  Yeah, I had a gym teacher that was a big fat guy, and he had a knee injury, and he was 
[02:53:00]  playing for, actually, he was just going to start playing for the Denver Broncos, and  he wound up being my gym teacher.  That's what you want, a bitter fucking giant man whose career was ended that now has to  deal with stoned fucking kids and play dodgeball.  Well, he was the most bitter motherfucker and took it out on every one of us.  Wouldn't you?  Of course.  It wasn't me, though. 
[02:53:30]  He sucked.  I fought my gym teacher in junior high.  Did you?  Was he a bulky old guy?  No, he wasn't an old guy.  He was a big fucking tall jock dick, wore those champion shorts, like those champion shorts  with the champion polo shirt every day, had a whistle, just a douchebag.  We're doing recess, you loser.  We're trying to smoke cigarettes without getting caught.  Never mind fucking.  And I caught him fucking threatening my friend, had him by the neck in a hallway. 
[02:54:00]  I went in during recess, and he had him, and I went, what the fuck are you doing?  They mean my friend?  We attacked him.  They think they're prison guards, gym teachers.  Yeah.  Like, they could just go around and fucking grab you by the throat, smack you in the fucking  head.  Yeah.  That was a good old days when he was teaching me doing that.  I had to get a guy with the big ring.  Oh, really?  He used to smack me in the head with the ring.  Oh, and give you like that tick.  Yeah, like that right on the head.  Right on the fucking ring.  Yeah.  What a prick.  Ah, fucking gym teachers could suck dick.  Oscar, why'd you bring this up? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, oh, oh, because...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, again.  Oscar.  I guess it was the John Candy reference.  Yeah, but we want to...  You said earlier you could cry on cue, and you said Tabasco does it.  You swallowed a lot of Tabasco and nothing, but then you said wasabi will definitely make  it happen.  So we got a little wasabi.  What is that?  A little snack pack of shushi meat, the shushi...  Peaches, and guacamole.  Yeah, that's good.  Sushi from a deli in New York.  Oh, man.  Why don't you eat that? 
[02:55:00]  That will make you cry.  And it's been sitting there for at least two hours now.  Oh, it actually smells good.  Salmon.  Let's see.  This is a salmon snack box.  Nice.  Oh, look.  Check it out.  This is the coolest thing.  I've never seen it.  It looks like a little ink cartridge, but it's soy sauce.  That's pretty amazing.  Okay.  Cool.  So should I just go for it and get this over and done with it?  Where's the wasabi?  They're right in here.  I guess I'm going to add the ginger.  No ginger.  No ginger?  No, because ginger's sweet.  No peaches.  No peaches. 
[02:55:30]  Only the guacamole.  They did a horrible job with the holy guacamole.  Will you get this for a hand pee or something?  How much wasabi can you put in your mouth at one time?  Oh.  You do it all.  Do it all.  Well, I'll just do a whole thing because I really want to cry.  Watching his hands makes me dizzy.  I want to cry for the show.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right.  So you're going to put that whole glob of wasabi in your mouth?  It's not really a lot.  All right.  You can do it.  That's a good amount.  That's a good amount.  That's a whole chunk, yeah.  That's good.  It's about the size of a marble.  Yeah.  It's not green.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's just go for it.  All right.  Yeah.  This will make you cry. 
[02:56:00]  Don't just swallow it.  I hope it makes me cry.  Don't just swallow it.  No, just kind of taste it.  Wish it around in your mouth a little bit.  Wish it.  Wish it around.  Nice.  Wish it around.  Press it up into your sinuses with your tongue.  I'm going to make my mama proud right here.  Yeah.  Here's Oscar.  Nervous Oscar.  That's a big fucking wad of wasabi, man.  This is going to be great.  A little wasabi.  Coming out the nose right now.  Is it?  Okay.  There we go.  Oh.  Are you going to cry?  Oh, it's the nose.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, my God.  That's a lot of wasabi, dude.  It was good. 
[02:56:30]  You're going to cry in it, though?  Yeah, I know.  He got a little tear, no?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's crying a little bit.  I don't see any water really running.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  What about now?  No?  He's blinking like fucking Jimmy.  There's just too much happiness in me for me to cry.  You're so happy to be here on the show, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  You can eat that much wasabi and that's all.  That's crazy.  I know.  I think we need more.  That's all?  I'd have to jump out the window if I hit that fucking...  You didn't feel it in your fucking skull or anything?  I bet it needed...  No, that wasn't as strong.  I'm surprised.  I bet it needed a little soy sauce to mix up and just to activate it. 
[02:57:00]  Now it's too late.  No, I'm just going to eat the salmon.  Now you're going to eat the salmon.  It's been sitting there for two hours.  Really?  It's from a deli.  Yeah, but it's salmon.  It's smoked.  Deli salmon under the lights.  It's there.  It's there, right?  No.  Your crying bit sucks.  Yeah, I know.  Well, it's wasabi's fault.  I really mind.  Oh, my God.  His hands make me dizzy.  I know.  He's shaking.  He's like twitching and rubbing himself. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, he likes that, Opie.  He likes that.  That's funny.  All right.  What did you bring to the show, Oscar?  I get...  Oh, phew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see.  What do I got for you today?  Pickup lines.  So I just...  You know how you're standing in the A&P, right?  And there's a really pretty girl and you don't know how to break the ice?  You go up to her like, I bought them apples.  Like, hey, how about them apples? 
[02:58:00]  That's it.  I got it.  Yeah.  But instead, you go, how about them apples?  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Next one.  Moving on.  What about...  Oh.  Hang on.  And you're like in the fried chicken section and then you go to the girl and you say,  it's like...  Hold on.  Okay.  I was going to say...  Oh, oh.  Got a lot of meat on them bones.  No.  Ah, fuck.  Wait, wait.  Fried chicken?  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Why does it have to be the fried chicken section?  No, because you're with the girl there, right?  And then you see the chicken and you say...  Can it just be like any meat that has a bone in it?  What if she's there with like a T-bone steak?  Yeah.  That's fine.  I'll work fine.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, striking up a conversation at a convenience store or...  So these are your ideas of breaking the ice with girls.  Yeah.  All right.  Absolutely.  That's not bad.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Got another one?  Um...  What?  What's up?  What's up? 
[02:59:00]  What's up?  Oh, you guys seen that movie Sex?  Sorry.  The movie Sex Drive?  It's a funny movie.  You know, the part where the guy goes, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  That's all he does?  That's funny.  Forget it.  Oh, I don't know what it is.  All right.  See, one time I went out with this girl.  I had a cow fetish.  So I went into her room and it was just packed with like stuffed animals, but it was like  cows, right?  Yeah.  So what happened after we came back with eating Thai food, she went in there and they said,  oh, would you get comfortable? 
[02:59:30]  And I said, yeah, sure.  And then she goes and she brought out like a cow custom, right?  And then, you know, the udder section?  Yeah.  Well, there was like a specific hole for a certain part of my body to stick through at, right?  Uh-huh.  And then she started licking them and shit like that.  Yeah.  And then her mom walked in and it was just awkward.  And then so I left.  I left my cow suit outside the house.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Wait, do you have a cow fetish?  No, the girl did.  So she had me put the whole suit on.  So she had a cow costume? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I guess for the guys that came into her life and want to experience it.  And you wore the same suit, so the other guy put his dick through?  I know.  I think of it as nasty.  Yes, I understand.  But is your face and everything covered, but your general?  No, no.  Just the face is on cover.  And then, you know, had a little cow.  And the general's are hanging.  I've seen this cow suit before, and it's got the rubber udders, but she cut one udder  off and her guy friends stick their dick through, and she, what, sucks the dick?  Yes, yes.  Or the one special udder. 
[03:00:30]  Well, same thing.  We understand.  Wow.  And then the mom walked in?  Mm-hmm.  It was awkward.  Like, it was silent.  Yeah, that's the suit.  Right?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Oh, my God.  That's exactly the suit.  And then you'd stick your dick through there, and she'd suck.  Why would she do that?  I don't know.  She's just like cows a lot.  I mean...  But you got in this costume, that costume, and stuck your dick through a hole that other  men have stuck their dicks through, and...  You know, now that you bring it up, I mean...  Isn't that just a pussy, anyways? 
[03:01:00]  Well, you know, you got a point.  Although those things tend to be a little self-cleaning.  I don't know what it is about the pussy.  The juices?  It's a magical, magical thing.  They should sell the juice from a pussy to clean bumpers.  Chrome.  Yeah.  It just shines up chrome.  Billy...  Billy Mays.  Oh!  Oh, shit.  He's the man.  Jesus Christ.  I love the guy.  You love Billy Mays?  Oh, I was Billy Mays last year for Halloween.  I had the beard.  I had the blue thing.  Were you?  Yeah.  You got a picture?  Oh, no.  I didn't take a picture. 
[03:01:30]  No, because I got invited to one party, and then I was just so tired from working the  whole day.  I was like, let me just stay at home and relax.  No, because Saturday is like, I think last year was a Saturday.  It was Halloween 31st, though.  Uh-huh.  It was Saturday.  So I started doing like, hi, it's Billy Mays!  Yeah.  Wow.  Do the impression.  Do like a...  Yeah, he has this thing with his hand.  He does that.  Well, not anymore.  Yeah, they crossed it on his chest.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the thing he does with it.  With all the rings removed.  All right.  Do a little Billy Mays. 
[03:02:00]  What does he sell?  The garden weasel or something?  I'll just put like OxiClean.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead.  Do some Billy Mays.  All right.  I love impressions.  Oh, wait, wait.  Hi, it's Billy Mays!  And that's not all.  Oh, fuck it.  You can get this for $9.95.  You can clean your carpet.  You can put it on cake.  And just look at that sign.  Mmm.  I used to do that a lot better.  I'm sorry.  I thought...  Jesus Christ. 
[03:02:30]  Damn it.  It's almost hypnotizing.  It is.  It's almost hypnotizing, brother.  You have to really think.  As he's talking, I really have to put an effort to think like, I better talk.  I could watch this concert all day.  But he has the best setups for everything.  And then they go nowhere.  Wow.  He gets your attention with it.  Oh, there's it.  Like, I wouldn't get that excited about a story, no matter what it is.  But you get so excited, and then just, you have nothing. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Anything else that you wrote down on the paper there?  Oh, let's see.  It's a cow store poppy.  I love it.  Oh, last year.  Actually, there's a video.  Like, I did a beer commercial for school last year.  Oh, for school?  Yeah, yeah.  It was...  I was helping out a friend, so all I did was act.  And if you want to pull it up, actually, go to YouTube.  Yeah, if you guys want to...  He's reduced himself to just making guttural noises now. 
[03:03:30]  That's all he's doing.  I've never seen a head that big on a human being.  It's just a square brick head.  Bink does stink.  Wow.  Oh, you type it in.  Yeah.  He's typing into YouTube.  His beer ad.  It's a beer commercial.  My friend, Bianca, did it?  Yeah, the top one is 30 seconds long.  Beer commercial.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like...  Why don't we crank this volume up?  Sure, sure, sure.  Premium acting right here.  All right. 
[03:04:00]  Let her rip.  I like the music.  Techno.  Man versus Babe, it says.  Hi-ya!  Is that Tom Bell?  Or do you want the Tom Bell?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God!  Hi-ya!  Is that Tom Bell?  Or do you want the Tom Bell?  I don't understand it.  Yeah, I don't.  Wait, wait.  What?  Are you supposed to be like a Japanese movie? 
[03:04:30]  Because your lips weren't matching the...  Yeah, it was some sort of kung fu, like an out-of-sync overdub on that, on the voiceover.  Yeah, yeah.  That hasn't been used a lot, so that's good.  Exactly, yeah.  So my friend, Bianca, came up with a concept, and she thought I was goofy around when I came  to pick up girls, because she knows I have that.  Was that Bianca?  No, no.  That was my friend, Grace.  We were partners in our production team for the TV2.  Did you ever get intimate with Grace?  No, no, because he had a boyfriend at the time. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, I think she still has a boyfriend.  Did you want to?  No, it's just we're good friends.  Did you find her cute?  Why ruin the friendship?  Oh, fuck that.  Why?  I'll tell you why.  To come.  Okay.  To come or something.  That's the only reason why you have fucking friends that are girls.  Good friends are girls that won't fuck you.  Oh, okay.  That's what a good friend is.  Because the second she wants to fuck you, you will fuck her.  Okay.  Just clueing you.  I'll take a note of that.  He's actually looking for paper and pencil.  He's writing it down, Anthony.  No, you know, it ran out of ink, so it's just fell. 
[03:05:30]  Anyways, what's...  What else you got in front of you?  Oh, you had an hour to prepare.  Fulfilled less than that.  You know what?  In real honesty, can I be honest with you guys?  When I started here June 1st, I thought, you know what?  I don't want any attention or anything.  I just want to go there, do my job, get my experience, and get my four credits.  That didn't work out.  And walk with my dignity, but that's at the door now.  Oh, that didn't work out too well.  No, but I didn't do anything that bad.  Just being you, you're an interesting fucking freak. 
[03:06:00]  Thank you.  It's better than being a fucking, I mean...  Another fucking nameless guy out there.  Just nameless guy that just fucking nobody talks to when he sits at a computer fucking making notes.  You're in the studio with two of the top fucking guys in the country being a fucking psychopath.  Sam Roberts and Bob Kelly.  Thank you.  And then there's Opie and Anthony, who are going to be done in a few months.  We're going to be done too.  They're done.  They're over in a few months.  We're taking over.  Exactly.  You, uh...  Yeah, so you wanted to be one of the faceless people that never get a mention, or... 
[03:06:30]  You could be a Mexican Superman.  Like, you know when Mexico always has, like, they...  How about a Mexican wrestler?  Just put a fucking mask on him.  Like a Vavoom guy?  Vavoom!  Yeah, we should do that.  Get a mask for you.  Yeah.  Do they have a mask?  Take your shirt off?  Oh, material.  Okay.  Let's go with Mexican material.  Do you have a story about waking up in a guy's fucking house?  Uh...  Okay.  After going to a gay bar?  Are you talking to me or him?  Oh, yes! 
[03:07:00]  Yes!  No, it will happen.  Check it out.  Check it out.  What happened was that, uh, it was, uh, like, 2006 or something.  It was, like, in the middle of July.  So, uh, one friend called me, and she was like, hey, let's go, let's go hang out, and  we'll meet my friend Jeremy.  So, so...  Oh, shit!  That's not his name.  It's, uh, Robert.  Robert.  What the fuck?  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I can't tell the story now.  His name's Robert.  His name's Robert, Bobby.  Stop.  Robert. 
[03:07:30]  Because Oscar's a classic.  Okay, Robert.  Your friend Robert.  Yeah, so, so we went, okay, so first...  Fucking spit it out, Nacho Libra.  It's fucking great.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you know what?  I used to be, I used to do, like, a look-alike...  Nacho Libra.  Jack Black.  Yeah, Nacho Libra.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had long hair, beard, and then I got a mullet after that.  How did that go?  How did you do that?  Fuck yeah, I just, because I look fat and shit like that, um...  Well, you don't look fat.  No?  Oh, thank you.  You are.  It's a call.  Oh.  I was going to take that as a compliment, but it was a compliment for, like, two seconds, 
[03:08:00]  wasn't it?  Yeah.  Actually, he doesn't even look fat.  Thank you, no.  He looks so skinny.  A little bit.  All right.  All right, your friend Robert, go ahead.  All right, so, so, so we went up to, uh, uh, oh, my, uh, to Hoboken.  There was, like, this bar there, uh, and, um, so we drank a couple beers, and then a friend  was going to come in, but she didn't come in because she didn't have her ID.  We got kicked out, so we ended up looking for places in the city, so then this guy, Robert,  goes, like, hey, man, I got a friend.  Let's go, let's go team up with him, so sure enough, we go in, and it was, like, it was 
[03:08:30]  a good bar, like, flat out, so what happened, the reason we went there, it was just to get  some stuff.  Stuff.  Stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  Stuff.  All right, um, okay, um...  Yeah, just write it down.  Yeah, I'll write it down.  All right, what's stuff, man?  Cock?  No.  Stop.  Blowjobs?  Uh, oh, wait, keep going, keep...  What is this, a fucking game show now?  Blow.  Oh!  He's trying...  What are you, trying to tease the story in the middle of the story? 
[03:09:00]  Fucking idiot.  All right, so, no, it was, um, it was, um, anyways, something to kind of, like, expand  on the whole night, um, and then, so then, yeah...  I don't think you're the type of guy that needs blow, though.  Yeah.  Can you imagine him on fucking blow?  No, no, no, I don't...  Holy shit.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  I don't touch this stuff.  His hair would stand up.  Oh, man.  And he's Colombian, really?  You would be a mad madman.  Why do you make it so easy?  Yeah.  From Colombia, and you're in a gay bar fucking looking for blow. 
[03:09:30]  Every gift your parents sent you is made of cocaine.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You know what?  I don't, I don't find that offensive at all, because, you know what?  I, I'm, I have a clean conscience, and I know, like, you know, my family is a hard-working  family, and then...  We love your family.  Yeah, yeah, so don't worry.  Very nice.  So, like, I don't get it, because my mom gets pissed off, and somebody says something in reference to  colombian and blow oh it's like mom you have to worry about it you have nothing but it's kind of  known for you know absolutely drug cartels and kidnapping doesn't help that our son's on a very  popular radio show talking about getting blow in a gay bar oh shit that sounds worse 
[03:10:00]  oh christ oh man you're worried about us saying cocaine it's the obvious every discovery channel  show is colombian cocaine and kidnapping yeah you know what it is true it is true no vacation  cruises to colombia oh it is true it is true but that's not there isn't yeah i stopped in colombia  on my way through panama did you get off the boat uh yeah but i i kept it in view i did not fucking 
[03:10:30]  were you holding it yeah i was pretty much leaning on the ship the whole time well but like that's  not all like what colombia's about i mean yeah it is that colombians have a history warned us  who the the cruise company warned us okay that look we're docking in colombia and i think they  just needed it to resupply or something what it wasn't like a real great port where we go to the  beaches and shit like that no the crew needed blow yeah we're gonna stop at colombia for an hour
